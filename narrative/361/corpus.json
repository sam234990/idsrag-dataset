At twenty-five, she is old for an unmarried woman. Her father's income and savings have been dissipated to pay for the extravagances of her brother, who subsequently committed suicide. Since her father has no living sons, his estate, which is entailed, will pass upon his death to a distant cousin, Will Belton.\nDespite her poor prospects, she has two eligible suitors. Within four days of making her acquaintance, Will Belton proposes marriage to her. Belton is warm-hearted, kind, and generous, and these qualities make a strong impression on Clara. However, she believes herself in love with Captain Frederic Aylmer, although he has given no clear signs of feeling that way toward her. Aylmer is impeccable in his manners, smooth, urbane, well-read, and a member of Parliament; compared to him, Belton is awkward and unpolished.\nClara rejects Belton's offer, urging him to regard her as a sister. Not long thereafter, Aylmer proposes to her, and she eagerly accepts. However, her happiness is short-lived. Her new fianc\u0102\u0160 proves shallow and cold, more concerned with his own comfort than with her happiness. Moreover, he expects her to subject herself to his domineering mother.\nMr. Amedroz dies; and although Belton offers to allow Clara to remain at Belton Castle, she goes to live with the Aylmer family in Yorkshire. Lady Aylmer, who wants her son to marry money or a title, exerts herself to make Clara miserable there; and Captain Aylmer offers no support to his betrothed.\nFor Clara, the final straw comes when Lady Aylmer demands that she sever her ties with a friend. Mrs. Askerton, Lady Aylmer has learned, left an abusive drunken husband in India and lived with Colonel Askerton for several years before the death of her husband freed her to marry him. Clara is duly appalled by her friend's past immorality, but cannot bring herself to cast off someone who has come to depend on her friendship. Pressed relentlessly on the subject by Lady Aylmer, she declares an end to her engagement and returns to Somersetshire, where she accepts the hospitality of the Askertons.\nWill Belton has never ceased to show his love for Clara, and she realises that he is worthy of her love. However, she believes that it would be wrong to transfer her affection from one man to another. Only after Mrs. Askerton and Will's sister Mary Belton persuade her that it would be unjust to withhold her affection from Will can she bring herself to put aside her scruples and accept him. Marital bliss ensues.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Belton Estate, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

And, in the case of this boy and girl the misfortune\nwas aggravated greatly by the peculiarities of the father's\ncharacter. Mr. Amedroz was not a bad man,--as men are held to be bad\nin the world's esteem. He was not vicious,--was not a gambler or a\ndrunkard,--was not self-indulgent to a degree that brought upon him\nany reproach; nor was he regardless of his children. But he was an\nidle, thriftless man, who, at the age of sixty-seven, when the reader\nwill first make his acquaintance, had as yet done no good in the\nworld whatever. Indeed he had done terrible evil; for his son Charles\nwas now dead,--had perished by his own hand,--and the state of things\nwhich had brought about this woful event had been chiefly due to the\nfather's neglect.\n\nBelton Castle is a pretty country seat, standing in a small\nbut beautifully wooded park, close under the Quantock hills in\nSomersetshire; and the little town of Belton clusters round the park\ngates. Few Englishmen know the scenery of England well, and the\nprettinesses of Somersetshire are among those which are the least\nknown. But the Quantock hills are very lovely, with their rich\nvalleys lying close among them, and their outlying moorlands running\noff towards Dulverton and the borders of Devonshire,--moorlands which\nare not flat, like Salisbury Plain, but are broken into ravines and\ndeep watercourses and rugged dells hither and thither; where old oaks\nare standing, in which life seems to have, dwindled down to the last\nspark; but the last spark is still there, and the old oaks give forth\ntheir scanty leaves from year to year.\n\nIn among the hills, somewhat off the high road from Minehead to\nTaunton, and about five miles from the sea, stands the little town,\nor village, of Belton, and the modern house of Mr. Amedroz, which\nis called Belton Castle. The village,--for it is in truth no more,\nthough it still maintains a charter for a market, and there still\nexists on Tuesdays some pretence of an open sale of grain and\nbutcher's meat in the square before the church-gate,--contains\nabout two thousand persons. That and the whole parish of Belton did\nonce,--and that not long ago,--belong to the Amedroz family. They had\ninherited it from the Beltons of old, an Amedroz having married the\nheiress of the family. And as the parish is large, stretching away to\nExmoor on one side, and almost to the sea on the other, containing\nthe hamlet of Redicote, lying on the Taunton high road,--Redicote,\nwhere the post-office is placed, a town almost in itself, and one\nwhich is now much more prosperous than Belton,--as the property when\nit came to the first Amedroz had limits such as these, the family had\nbeen considerable in the county. But these limits had been straitened\nin the days of the grandfather and the father of Bernard Amedroz; and\nhe, when he married a Miss Winterfield of Taunton, was thought to\nhave done very well, in that mortgages were paid off the property\nwith his wife's money to such an extent as to leave him in clear\npossession of an estate that gave him two thousand a year. As Mr.\nAmedroz had no grand neighbours near him, as the place is remote\nand the living therefore cheap, and as with this income there was\nno question of annual visits to London, Mr. and Mrs. Amedroz might\nhave done very well with such of the good things of the world as had\nfallen to their lot. And had the wife lived such would probably have\nbeen the case; for the Winterfields were known to be prudent people.\nBut Mrs. Amedroz had died young, and things with Bernard Amedroz had\ngone badly.\n\nAnd yet the evil had not been so much with him as with that terrible\nboy of his. The father had been nearly forty when he married. He had\nthen never done any good; but as neither had he done much harm, the\nfriends of the family had argued well of his future career. After\nhim, unless he should leave a son behind him, there would be no\nAmedroz left among the Quantock hills; and by some arrangement\nin respect to that Winterfield money which came to him on his\nmarriage,--the Winterfields having a long-dated connection with the\nBeltons of old,--the Amedroz property was, at Bernard's marriage,\nentailed back upon a distant Belton cousin, one Will Belton, whom\nno one had seen for many years, but who was by blood nearer to the\nsquire, in default of children of his own, than any other of his\nrelatives. And now Will Belton was the heir to Belton Castle; for\nCharles Amedroz, at the age of twenty-seven, had found the miseries\nof the world to be too many for him, and had put an end to them and\nto himself.\n\nCharles had been a clever fellow,--a very clever fellow in the eyes\nof his father. Bernard Amedroz knew that he himself was not a clever\nfellow, and admired his son accordingly; and when Charles had been\nexpelled from Harrow for some boyish freak,--in his vengeance against\na neighbouring farmer, who had reported to the school authorities the\ndoings of a few beagles upon his land, Charles had cut off the heads\nof all the trees in a young fir plantation,--his father was proud of\nthe exploit. When he was rusticated a second time from Trinity, and\nwhen the father received an intimation that his son's name had better\nbe taken from the College books, the squire was not so well pleased;\nbut even then he found some delight in the stories which reached him\nof his son's vagaries; and when the young man commenced Bohemian life\nin London, his father did nothing to restrain him. Then there came\nthe old story--debts, endless debts; and lies, endless lies. During\nthe two years before his death, his father paid for him, or undertook\nto pay, nearly ten thousand pounds, sacrificing the life assurances\nwhich were to have made provision for his daughter; sacrificing, to a\ngreat extent, his own life income,--sacrificing everything, so that\nthe property might not be utterly ruined at his death. That Charles\nAmedroz should be a brighter, greater man than any other Amedroz,\nhad still been the father's pride. At the last visit which Charles\nhad paid to Belton his father had called upon him to pledge himself\nsolemnly that his sister should not be made to suffer by what had\nbeen done for him. Within a month of that time he had blown his\nbrains out in his London lodgings, thus making over the entire\nproperty to Will Belton at his father's death. At that last pretended\nsettlement with his father and his father's lawyer, he had kept back\nthe mention of debts as heavy nearly as those to which he had owned;\nand there were debts of honour, too, of which he had not spoken,\ntrusting to the next event at Newmarket to set him right. The next\nevent at Newmarket had set him more wrong than ever, and so there had\ncome an end to everything with Charles Amedroz.\n\nThis had happened in the spring, and the afflicted father,--afflicted\nwith the double sorrow of his son's terrible death and his daughter's\nruin,--had declared that he would turn his face to the wall and die.\nBut the old squire's health, though far from strong, was stronger\nthan he had deemed it, and his feelings, sharp enough, were less\nsharp than he had thought them; and when a month had passed by, he\nhad discovered that it would be better that he should live, in order\nthat his daughter might still have bread to eat and a house of her\nown over her head. Though he was now an impoverished man, there was\nstill left to him the means of keeping up the old home; and he told\nhimself that it must, if possible, be so kept that a few pounds\nannually might be put by for Clara. The old carriage-horses were\nsold, and the park was let to a farmer, up to the hall door of the\ncastle. So much the squire could do; but as to the putting by of\nthe few pounds, any dependence on such exertion as that on his part\nwould, we may say, be very precarious.\n\nBelton Castle was not in truth a castle. Immediately before the front\ndoor, so near to the house as merely to allow of a broad road running\nbetween it and the entrance porch, there stood an old tower, which\ngave its name to the residence,--an old square tower, up which the\nAmedroz boys for three generations had been able to climb by means\nof the ivy and broken stones in one of the inner corners,--and this\ntower was a remnant of a real castle that had once protected the\nvillage of Belton. The house itself was an ugly residence, three\nstories high, built in the time of George II., with low rooms and\nlong passages, and an immense number of doors. It was a large\nunattractive house,--unattractive, that is, as regarded its own\nattributes,--but made interesting by the beauty of the small park in\nwhich it stood. Belton Park did not, perhaps, contain much above a\nhundred acres, but the land was so broken into knolls and valleys,\nin so many places was the rock seen to be cropping up through the\nverdure, there were in it so many stunted old oaks, so many points\nof vantage for the lover of scenery, that no one would believe it\nto be other than a considerable domain. The farmer who took it, and\nwho would not under any circumstances undertake to pay more than\nseventeen shillings an acre for it, could not be made to think that\nit was in any way considerable. But Belton Park, since first it\nwas made a park, had never before been regarded after this fashion.\nFarmer Stovey, of the Grange, was the first man of that class who\nhad ever assumed the right to pasture his sheep in Belton chase,--as\nthe people around were still accustomed to call the woodlands of the\nestate.\n\nIt was full summer at Belton, and four months had now passed since\nthe dreadful tidings had reached the castle. It was full summer,\nand the people of the village were again going about their ordinary\nbusiness; and the shop-girls, with their lovers from Redicote, were\nagain to be seen walking among the oaks in the park on a Sunday\nevening; and the world in that district of Somersetshire was getting\nitself back into its grooves. The fate of the young heir had\ndisturbed the grooves greatly, and had taught many in those parts to\nfeel that the world was coming to an end. They had not loved young\nAmedroz, for he had been haughty when among them, and there had been\nwrongs committed by the dissolute young squire, and grief had come\nfrom his misdoings upon more than one household; but to think that he\nshould have destroyed himself with his own hand! And then, to think\nthat Miss Clara would become a beggar when the old squire should die!\nAll the neighbours around understood the whole history of the entail,\nand knew that the property was to go to Will Belton. Now Will Belton\nwas not a gentleman! So, at least, said the Belton folk, who had\nheard that the heir had been brought up as a farmer somewhere in\nNorfolk. Will Belton had once been at the Castle as a boy, now some\nfifteen years ago, and then there had sprung up a great quarrel\nbetween him and his distant cousin Charles;--and Will, who was rough\nand large of stature, had thrashed the smaller boy severely; and the\nthing had grown to have dimensions larger than those which generally\nattend the quarrels of boys; and Will had said something which\nhad shown how well he understood his position in reference to the\nestate;--and Charles had hated him. So Will had gone, and had been\nno more seen among the oaks whose name he bore. And the people, in\nspite of his name, regarded him as an interloper. To them, with their\nshort memories and scanty knowledge of the past, Amedroz was more\nhonourable than Belton, and they looked upon the coming man as an\nintruder. Why should not Miss Clara have the property? Miss Clara had\nnever done harm to any one!\n\nThings got back into their old grooves, and at the end of the third\nmonth the squire was once more seen in the old family pew at church.\nHe was a large man, who had been very handsome, and who now, in his\nyellow leaf, was not without a certain beauty of manliness. He wore\nhis hair and his beard long; before his son's death they were grey,\nbut now they were very white. And though he stooped, there was still\na dignity in his slow step,--a dignity that came to him from nature\nrather than from any effort. He was a man who, in fact, did little or\nnothing in the world,--whose life had been very useless; but he had\nbeen gifted with such a presence that he looked as though he were\none of God's nobler creatures. Though always dignified he was ever\naffable, and the poor liked him better than they might have done had\nhe passed his time in searching out their wants and supplying them.\nThey were proud of their squire, though he had done nothing for them.\nIt was something to them to have a man who could so carry himself\nsitting in the family pew in their parish church. They knew that he\nwas poor, but they all declared that he was never mean. He was a\nreal gentleman,--was this last Amedroz of the family; therefore they\ncurtsied low, and bowed on his reappearance among them, and made all\nthose signs of reverential awe which are common to the poor when they\nfeel reverence for the presence of a superior.\n\nClara was there with him, but she had shown herself in the pew for\nfour or five weeks before this. She had not been at home when the\nfearful news had reached Belton, being at that time with a certain\nlady who lived on the further side of the county, at Perivale,--a\ncertain Mrs. Winterfield, born a Folliott, a widow, who stood to Miss\nAmedroz in the place of an aunt. Mrs. Winterfield was, in truth, the\nsister of a gentleman who had married Clara's aunt,--there having\nbeen marriages and intermarriages between the Winterfields and\nthe Folliotts, and the Belton-Amedroz families. With this lady in\nPerivale, which I maintain to be the dullest little town in England,\nMiss Amedroz was staying when the news reached her father, and when\nit was brought direct from London to herself. Instantly she had\nhurried home, making the journey with all imaginable speed though her\nheart was all but broken within her bosom. She had found her father\nstricken to the ground, and it was the more necessary, therefore,\nthat she should exert herself. It would not do that she also should\nyield to that longing for death which terrible calamities often\nproduce for a season.\n\nClara Amedroz, when she first heard the news of her brother's fate,\nhad felt that she was for ever crushed to the ground. She had known\ntoo well what had been the nature of her brother's life, but she\nhad not expected or feared any such termination to his career as\nthis which had now come upon him--to the terrible affliction of all\nbelonging to him. She felt at first, as did also her father, that\nshe and he were annihilated as regards this world, not only by an\nenduring grief, but also by a disgrace which would never allow her\nagain to hold up her head. And for many a long year much of this\nfeeling clung to her;--clung to her much more strongly than to her\nfather. But strength was hers to perceive, even before she had\nreached her home, that it was her duty to repress both the feeling\nof shame and the sorrow, as far as they were capable of repression.\nHer brother had been weak, and in his weakness had sought a coward's\nescape from the ills of the world around him. She must not also be a\ncoward! Bad as life might be to her henceforth, she must endure it\nwith such fortitude as she could muster. So resolving she returned to\nher father, and was able to listen to his railings with a fortitude\nthat was essentially serviceable both to him and to herself.\n\n\"Both of you! Both of you!\" the unhappy father had said in his woe.\n\"The wretched boy has destroyed you as much as himself!\" \"No, sir,\"\nshe had answered, with a forbearance in her misery, which, terrible\nas was the effort, she forced herself to accomplish for his sake. \"It\nis not so. No thought of that need add to your grief. My poor brother\nhas not hurt me;--not in the way you mean.\" \"He has ruined us all,\"\nsaid the father; \"root and branch, man and woman, old and young,\nhouse and land. He has brought the family to an end;--ah me, to such\nan end!\" After that the name of him who had taken himself from among\nthem was not mentioned between the father and daughter, and Clara\nsettled herself to the duties of her new life, striving to live as\nthough there was no great sorrow around her--as though no cloud-storm\nhad burst over her head.\n\nThe family lawyer, who lived at Taunton, had communicated the fact of\nCharles's death to Mr. Belton, and Belton had acknowledged the letter\nwith the ordinary expressions of regret. The lawyer had alluded to\nthe entail, saying that it was improbable that Mr. Amedroz would have\nanother son. To this Belton had replied that for his cousin Clara's\nsake he hoped that the squire's life might be long spared. The lawyer\nsmiled as he read the wish, thinking to himself that luckily no wish\non the part of Will Belton could influence his old client either for\ngood or evil. What man, let alone what lawyer, will ever believe\nin the sincerity of such a wish as that expressed by the heir to a\nproperty? And yet where is the man who will not declare to himself\nthat such, under such circumstances, would be his own wish?\n\nClara Amedroz at this time was not a very young lady. She had already\npassed her twenty-fifth birthday, and in manners, appearance, and\nhabits was, at any rate, as old as her age. She made no pretence to\nyouth, speaking of herself always as one whom circumstances required\nto take upon herself age in advance of her years. She did not dress\nyoung, or live much with young people, or correspond with other\ngirls by means of crossed letters; nor expect that, for her, young\npleasures should be provided. Life had always been serious with her;\nbut now, we may say, since the terrible tragedy in the family, it\nmust be solemn as well as serious. The memory of her brother must\nalways be upon her; and the memory also of the fact that her father\nwas now an impoverished man, on whose behalf it was her duty to care\nthat every shilling spent in the house did its full twelve pennies'\nworth of work. There was a mixture in this of deep tragedy and of\nlittle care, which seemed to destroy for her the poetry as well as\nthe pleasure of life. The poetry and tragedy might have gone hand\nin hand together; and so might the cares and pleasures of life have\ndone, had there been no black sorrow of which she must be ever\nmindful. But it was her lot to have to scrutinize the butcher's bill\nas she was thinking of her brother's fate; and to work daily among\nsmall household things while the spectre of her brother's corpse was\never before her eyes.\n\nA word must be said to explain how it had come to pass that the life\nled by Miss Amedroz had been more than commonly serious before that\ntragedy had befallen the family. The name of the lady who stood to\nClara in the place of an aunt has been already mentioned. When a girl\nhas a mother, her aunt may be little or nothing to her. But when\nthe mother is gone, if there be an aunt unimpeded with other family\nduties, then the family duties of that aunt begin--and are assumed\nsometimes with great vigour. Such had been the case with Mrs.\nWinterfield. No woman ever lived, perhaps, with more conscientious\nideas of her duty as a woman than Mrs. Winterfield of Prospect Place,\nPerivale. And this, as I say it, is intended to convey no scoff\nagainst that excellent lady. She was an excellent lady--unselfish,\ngiven to self-restraint, generous, pious, looking to find in her\nreligion a safe path through life--a path as safe as the facts of\nAdam's fall would allow her feet to find. She was a woman fearing\nmuch for others, but fearing also much for herself, striving to\nmaintain her house in godliness, hating sin, and struggling with the\nweakness of her humanity so that she might not allow herself to hate\nthe sinners. But her hatred for the sin she found herself bound at\nall times to pronounce--to show it by some act at all seasons. To\nfight the devil was her work--was the appointed work of every living\nsoul, if only living souls could be made to acknowledge the necessity\nof the task. Now an aunt of that kind, when she assumes her duties\ntowards a motherless niece, is apt to make life serious.\n\nBut, it will be said, Clara Amedroz could have rebelled; and Clara's\nfather was hardly made of such stuff that obedience to the aunt would\nbe enforced on her by parental authority. Doubtless Clara could\nhave rebelled against her aunt. Indeed, I do not know that she had\nhitherto been very obedient. But there were family facts about these\nWinterfield connections which would have made it difficult for her\nto ignore her so-called aunt, even had she wished to do so. Mrs.\nWinterfield had twelve hundred a year at her own disposal, and she\nwas the only person related to the Amedroz family from whom Mr.\nAmedroz had a right to have expectations on his daughter's behalf.\nClara had, in a measure, been claimed by the lady, and the father had\nmade good the lady's claim, and Clara had acknowledged that a portion\nof her life was due to the demands of Perivale. These demands had\nundoubtedly made her life serious.\n\nLife at Perivale was a very serious thing. As regards amusement,\nordinarily so called, the need of any such institution was not\nacknowledged at Prospect House. Food, drink, and raiment were\nacknowledged to be necessary to humanity, and, in accordance with the\nrules of that house, they were supplied in plenty, and good of their\nkind. Such ladies as Mrs. Winterfield generally keep good tables,\nthinking no doubt that the eatables should do honour to the grace\nthat is said for them. And Mrs. Winterfield herself always wore a\nthick black silk dress,--not rusty or dowdy with age,--but with\nsome gloss of the silk on it; giving away, with secret, underhand,\nundiscovered charity, her old dresses to another lady of her own\nsort, on whom fortune had not bestowed twelve hundred a year. And\nMrs. Winterfield kept a low, four-wheeled, one-horsed little phaeton,\nin which she made her pilgrimages among the poor of Perivale, driven\nby the most solemn of stable-boys, dressed up in a white great coat,\nthe most priggish of hats, and white cotton gloves. At the rate of\nfive miles an hour was she driven about, and this driving was to\nher the amusement of life. But such an occupation to Clara Amedroz\nassisted to make life serious.\n\nIn person Mrs. Winterfield was tall and thin, wearing on her brow\nthin braids of false hair. She had suffered much from acute ill\nhealth, and her jaws were sunken, and her eyes were hollow, and there\nwas a look of woe about her which seemed ever to be telling of her\nown sorrows in this world and of the sorrows of others in the world\nto come. Ill-nature was written on her face, but in this her face was\na false face. She had the manners of a cross, peevish woman; but her\nmanners also were false, and gave no proper idea of her character.\nBut still, such as she was, she made life very serious to those who\nwere called upon to dwell with her.\n\nI need, I hope, hardly say that a young lady such as Miss Amedroz,\neven though she had reached the age of twenty-five,--for at the time\nto which I am now alluding she had nearly done so,--and was not young\nof her age, had formed for herself no plan of life in which her\naunt's money figured as a motive power. She had gone to Perivale\nwhen she was very young, because she had been told to do so, and had\ncontinued to go, partly from obedience, partly from habit, and partly\nfrom affection. An aunt's dominion, when once well established in\nearly years, cannot easily be thrown altogether aside,--even though\na young lady have a will of her own. Now Clara Amedroz had a strong\nwill of her own, and did not at all,--at any rate in these latter\ndays,--belong to that school of divinity in which her aunt shone\nalmost as a professor. And this circumstance, also, added to the\nseriousness of her life. But in regard to her aunt's money she had\nentertained no established hopes; and when her aunt opened her mind\nto her on that subject, a few days before the arrival of the fatal\nnews at Perivale, Clara, though she was somewhat surprised, was by\nno means disappointed. Now there was a certain Captain Aylmer in the\nquestion, of whom in this opening chapter it will be necessary to say\na few words.\n\nCaptain Frederic Folliott Aylmer was, in truth, the nephew of Mrs.\nWinterfield, whereas Clara Amedroz was not, in truth, her niece. And\nCaptain Aylmer was also Member of Parliament for the little borough\nof Perivale, returned altogether on the Low Church interest,--for\na devotion to which, and for that alone, Perivale was noted\namong boroughs. These facts together added not a little to Mrs.\nWinterfield's influence and professorial power in the place, and gave\na dignity to the one-horse chaise which it might not otherwise have\npossessed. But Captain Aylmer was only the second son of his father,\nSir Anthony Aylmer, who had married a Miss Folliott, sister of our\nMrs. Winterfield. On Frederic Aylmer his mother's estate was settled.\nThat and Mrs. Winterfield's property lay in the neighbourhood of\nPerivale; and now, on the occasion to which I am alluding, Mrs.\nWinterfield thought it necessary to tell Clara that the property must\nall go together. She had thought about it, and had doubted about it,\nand had prayed about it, and now she found that such a disposition of\nit was her duty.\n\n\"I am quite sure you're right, aunt,\" Clara had said. She knew very\nwell what had come of that provision which her father had attempted\nto make for her, and knew also how great were her father's\nexpectations in regard to Mrs. Winterfield's money.\n\n\"I hope I am; but I have thought it right to tell you. I shall feel\nmyself bound to tell Frederic. I have had many doubts, but I think\nI am right.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are, aunt. What would he think of me if, at some\nfuture time, he should have to find that I had been in his way?\"\n\n\"The future time will not be long now, my dear.\"\n\n\"I hope it may; but long or short, it is better so.\"\n\n\"I think it is, my dear; I think it is. I think it is my duty.\"\n\nIt must be understood that Captain Aylmer was member for Perivale on\nthe Low Church interest, and that, therefore, when at Perivale he was\ndecidedly a Low Churchman. I am not aware that the peculiarity stuck\nto him very closely at Aylmer Castle, in Yorkshire, or among his\nfriends in London; but there was no hypocrisy in this, as the world\ngoes. Women in such matters are absolutely false if they be not\nsincere; but men, with political views, and with much of their\nfuture prospects in jeopardy also, are allowed to dress themselves\ndifferently for different scenes. Whatever be the peculiar interest\non which a man goes into Parliament, of course he has to live up to\nthat in his own borough. Whether malt, the franchise, or teetotalism\nbe his rallying point, of course he is full of it when among his\nconstituents. But it is not desirable that he should be full of it\nalso at his club. Had Captain Aylmer become Prime Minister, he would\nno doubt, have made Low Church bishops. It was the side to which he\nhad taken himself in that matter,--not without good reasons. And\nhe could say a sharp word or two in season about vestments; he was\nstrong against candles, and fought for his side fairly well. No one\nhad good right to complain of Captain Aylmer as being insincere; but\nhad his aunt known the whole history of her nephew's life, I doubt\nwhether she would have made him her heir,--thinking that in doing so\nshe was doing the best for the good cause.\n\nThe whole history of her niece's life she did know, and she knew that\nClara was not with her, heart and soul. Had Clara left the old woman\nin doubt on this subject, she would have been a hypocrite. Captain\nAylmer did not often spend a Sunday at Perivale, but when he did, he\nwent to church three times, and submitted himself to the yoke. He was\nthinking of the borough votes quite as much as of his aunt's money,\nand was carrying on his business after the fashion of men. But Clara\nfound herself compelled to maintain some sort of a fight, though she\nalso went to church three times on Sunday. And there was another\nreason why Mrs. Winterfield thought it right to mention Captain\nAylmer's name to her niece on this occasion.\n\n\"I had hoped,\" she said, \"that it might make no difference in what\nway my money was left.\"\n\nClara well understood what this meant, as will, probably, the reader\nalso. \"I can't say but what it will make a difference,\" she answered,\nsmiling; \"but I shall always think that you have done right. Why\nshould I stand in Captain Aylmer's way?\"\n\n\"I had hoped your ways might have been the same,\" said the old lady,\nfretfully.\n\n\"But they cannot be the same.\"\n\n\"No; you do not see things as he sees them. Things that are serious\nto him are, I fear, only light to you. Dear Clara, would I could\nsee you more in earnest as to the only matter that is worth our\nearnestness.\" Miss Amedroz said nothing as to the Captain's\nearnestness, though, perhaps, her ideas as to his ideas about\nreligion were more correct than those held by Mrs. Winterfield. But\nit would not have suited her to raise any argument on that subject.\n\"I pray for you, Clara,\" continued the old lady; \"and will do so as\nlong as the power of prayer is left to me. I hope,--I hope you do not\ncease to pray for yourself?\"\n\n\"I endeavour, aunt.\"\n\n\"It is an endeavour which, if really made, never fails.\"\n\nClara said nothing more, and her aunt also remained silent. Soon\nafterwards, the four-wheeled carriage, with the demure stable-boy,\ncame to the door, and Clara was driven up and down through the\nstreets of Perivale in a manner which was an injury to her. She knew\nthat she was suffering an injustice, but it was one of which she\ncould not make complaint. She submitted to her aunt, enduring the\npenances that were required of her; and, therefore, her aunt had\nopportunity enough to see her shortcomings. Mrs. Winterfield did see\nthem, and judged her accordingly. Captain Aylmer, being a man and a\nMember of Parliament, was called upon to bear no such penances, and,\ntherefore, his shortcomings were not suspected.\n\nBut, after all, what title had she ever possessed to entertain\nexpectations from Mrs. Winterfield? When she thought of it all in her\nroom that night, she told herself that it was strange that her aunt\nshould have spoken to her in such a way on such a subject. But, then,\nso much had been said to her on the matter by her father, so much, no\ndoubt, had reached her aunt's ears also, the hope that her position\nwith reference to the rich widow at Perivale might be beneficial to\nher had been so often discussed at Belton as a make-weight against\nthe extravagance of the heir, there had already been so much of this\nmistake, that she taught herself to perceive that the communication\nwas needed. \"In her honesty she has not chosen to leave me with false\nhopes,\" said Clara to herself. And at that moment she loved her aunt\nfor her honesty.\n\nThen, on the day but one following this conversation as to the\ndestiny of her aunt's property, came the terrible tidings of her\nbrother's death. Captain Aylmer, who had been in London at the time,\nhurried down to Perivale, and had been the first to tell Miss Amedroz\nwhat had happened. The words spoken between them then had not been\nmany, but Clara knew that Captain Aylmer had been kind to her; and\nwhen he had offered to accompany her to Belton, she had thanked him\nwith a degree of gratitude which had almost seemed to imply more of\nregard between them than Clara would have acknowledged to exist. But\nin moments such as those, soft words may be spoken and hands may be\npressed without any of that meaning which soft words and the grasping\nof hands generally carry with them. As far as Taunton Captain Aylmer\ndid go with Miss Amedroz, and there they parted, he on his journey up\nto town, and she for her father's desolate house at Belton.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE HEIR PROPOSES TO VISIT HIS COUSINS.\n\n\nIt was full summer at Belton, and the sweet scent of the new hay\nfilled the porch of the old house with fragrance, as Clara sat there\nalone with her work. Immediately before the house door, between that\nand the old tower, there stood one of Farmer Stovey's hay-carts, now\nempty, with an old horse between the shafts looking as though he were\nasleep in the sun. Immediately beyond the tower the men were loading\nanother cart, and the women and children were chattering as they\nraked the scattered remnants up to the rows. Under the shadow of the\nold tower, but in sight of Clara as she sat in the porch, there lay\nthe small beer-barrels of the hay-makers, and three or four rakes\nwere standing erect against the old grey wall. It was now eleven\no'clock, and Clara was waiting for her father, who was not yet out\nof his room. She had taken his breakfast to him in bed, as was her\ncustom; for he had fallen into idle ways, and the luxury of his bed\nwas, of all his remaining luxuries, the one that he liked the best.\nAfter a while he came down to her, having an open letter in his hand.\nClara saw that he intended either to show it to her or to speak of\nit, and asked him therefore, with some tone of interest in her voice,\nfrom whom it had come. But Mr. Amedroz was fretful at the moment, and\ninstead of answering her began to complain of his tenant's ill-usage\nof him.\n\n\"What has he got his cart there for? I haven't let him the road up to\nthe hall door. I suppose he will bring his things into the parlour\nnext.\"\n\n\"I rather like it, papa.\"\n\n\"Do you? I can only say that you're lucky in your tastes. I don't\nlike it, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Stovey is out there. Shall I ask him to have the things moved\nfurther off?\"\n\n\"No, my dear,--no. I must bear it, as I do all the rest of it. What\ndoes it matter? There'll be an end of it soon. He pays his rent, and\nI suppose he is right to do as he pleases. But I can't say that I\nlike it.\"\n\n\"Am I to see the letter, papa?\" she asked, wishing to turn his mind\nfrom the subject of the hay-cart.\n\n\"Well, yes. I brought it for you to see; though perhaps I should be\ndoing better if I burned it, and said nothing more about it. It is a\nmost impudent production; and heartless,--very heartless.\"\n\nClara was accustomed to such complaints as these from her father.\nEverything that everybody did around him he would call heartless.\nThe man pitied himself so much in his own misery, that he expected\nto live in an atmosphere of pity from others; and though the pity\ndoubtless was there, he misdoubted it. He thought that Farmer Stovey\nwas cruel in that he had left the hay-cart near the house, to wound\nhis eyes by reminding him that he was no longer master of the ground\nbefore his own hall door. He thought that the women and children were\ncruel to chatter so near his ears. He almost accused his daughter of\ncruelty, because she had told him that she liked the contiguity of\nthe hay-making. Under such circumstances as those which enveloped him\nand her, was it not heartless in her to like anything? It seemed to\nhim that the whole world of Belton should be drowned in woe because\nof his misery.\n\n\"Where is it from, papa?\" she asked.\n\n\"There, you may read it. Perhaps it is better that you should know\nthat it has been written.\" Then she read the letter, which was as\nfollows:--\n\n\"Plaistow Hall, -- July, 186--.\"\n\nThough she had never before seen the handwriting, she knew at once\nfrom whence came the letter, for she had often heard of Plaistow\nHall. It was the name of the farm at which her distant cousin, Will\nBelton, lived, and her father had more than once been at the trouble\nof explaining to her, that though the place was called a hall, the\nhouse was no more than a farmhouse. He had never seen Plaistow\nHall, and had never been in Norfolk; but so much he could take upon\nhimself to say, \"They call all the farms halls down there.\" It was\nnot wonderful that he should dislike his heir; and, perhaps, not\nunnatural that he should show his dislike after this fashion. Clara,\nwhen she read the address, looked up into her father's face. \"You\nknow who it is now,\" he said. And then she read the letter.\n\n\n   Plaistow Hall, -- July, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,\n\n   I have not written to you before since your bereavement,\n   thinking it better to wait awhile; but I hope you have\n   not taken me to be unkind in this, or have supposed me\n   to be unmindful of your sorrow. Now I take up my pen,\n   hoping that I may make you understand how greatly I was\n   distressed by what has occurred. I believe I am now the\n   nearest male relative that you have, and as such I am very\n   anxious to be of service to you if it may be possible.\n   Considering the closeness of our connection, and my\n   position in reference to the property, it seems bad that\n   we should never meet. I can assure you that you would find\n   me very friendly if we could manage to come together.\n\n   I should think nothing of running across to Belton, if you\n   would receive me at your house. I could come very well\n   before harvest, if that would suit you, and would stay\n   with you for a week. Pray give my kindest regards to my\n   cousin Clara, whom I can only just remember as a very\n   little girl. She was with her aunt at Perivale when I was\n   at Belton as a boy. She shall find a friend in me if she\n   wants a friend.\n\n   Your affectionate cousin,\n\n   W. BELTON.\n\n\nClara read the letter very slowly, so that she might make herself\nsure of its tone and bearing before she was called upon by her\nfather to express her feeling respecting it. She knew that she would\nbe expected to abuse it violently, and to accuse the writer of\nvulgarity, insolence, and cruelty; but she had already learned that\nshe must not allow herself to accede to all her father's fantasies.\nFor his sake, and for his protection, it was necessary that she\nshould differ from him, and even contradict him. Were she not to do\nso, he would fall into a state of wailing and complaining that would\nexaggerate itself almost to idiotcy. And it was imperative that\nshe herself should exercise her own opinion on many points, almost\nwithout reference to him. She alone knew how utterly destitute she\nwould be when he should die. He, in the first days of his agony, had\nsobbed forth his remorse as to her ruin; but, even when doing so,\nhe had comforted himself with the remembrance of Mrs. Winterfield's\nmoney, and Mrs. Winterfield's affection for his daughter. And the\naunt, when she had declared her purpose to Clara, had told herself\nthat the provision made for Clara by her father was sufficient. To\nneither of them had Clara told her own position. She could not inform\nher aunt that her father had given up to the poor reprobate who had\ndestroyed himself all that had been intended for her. Had she done so\nshe would have been asking her aunt for charity. Nor would she bring\nherself to add to her father's misery, by destroying the hopes which\nstill supported him. She never spoke of her own position in regard\nto money, but she knew that it had become her duty to live a wary,\nwatchful life, taking much upon herself in their impoverished\nhousehold, and holding her own opinion against her father's when her\ndoing so became expedient. So she finished the letter in silence, and\ndid not speak at the moment when the movement of her eyes declared\nthat she had completed the task.\n\n\"Well,\" said he.\n\n\"I do not think my cousin means badly.\"\n\n\"You don't! I do, then. I think he means very badly. What business\nhas he to write to me, talking of his position?\"\n\n\"I can't see anything amiss in his doing so, papa. I think he wishes\nto be friendly. The property will be his some day, and I don't see\nwhy that should not be mentioned, when there is occasion.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Clara, you surprise me. But women never understand\ndelicacy in regard to money. They have so little to do with it,\nand think so little about it, that they have no occasion for such\ndelicacy.\"\n\nClara could not help the thought that to her mind the subject was\npresent with sufficient frequency to make delicacy very desirable,\nif only it were practicable. But of this she said nothing. \"And what\nanswer will you send to him, papa?\" she asked.\n\n\"None at all. Why should I trouble myself to write to him?\"\n\n\"I will take the trouble off your hands.\"\n\n\"And what will you say to him?\"\n\n\"I will ask him to come here, as he proposes.\"\n\n\"Clara!\"\n\n\"Why not, papa? He is the heir to the property, and why should he\nnot be permitted to see it? There are many things in which his\nco-operation with you might be a comfort to you. I can't tell you\nwhether the tenants and people are treating you well, but he can do\nso; and, moreover, I think he means to be kind. I do not see why\nwe should quarrel with our cousin because he is the heir to your\nproperty. It is not through any doing of his own that he is so.\"\n\nThis reasoning had no effect upon Mr. Amedroz, but his daughter's\nresolution carried the point against him in spite of his want of\nreason. No letter was written that day, or on the next; but on the\nday following a formal note was sent off by Clara, in which Mr.\nBelton was told that Mr. Amedroz would be happy to receive him at\nBelton Castle. The letter was written by the daughter, but the father\nwas responsible for the formality. He sat over her while she wrote\nit, and nearly drove her distracted by discussing every word and\nphrase. At last, Clara was so annoyed with her own production, that\nshe was almost tempted to write another letter unknown to her father;\nbut the formal note went.\n\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,\n\n   I am desired by my father to say that he will be happy\n   to receive you at Belton Castle, at the time fixed by\n   yourself.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   CLARA AMEDROZ.\n\n\nThere was no more than that, but that had the desired effect; and by\nreturn of post there came a rejoinder, saying that Will Belton would\nbe at the Castle on the fifteenth of August. \"They can do without me\nfor about ten days,\" he said in his postscript, writing in a familiar\ntone, which did not seem to have been at all checked by the coldness\nof his cousin's note,--\"as our harvest will be late; but I must be\nback for a week's work before the partridges.\"\n\n\"Heartless! quite heartless!\" Mr. Amedroz said as he read this.\n\"Partridges! to talk of partridges at such a time as this!\"\n\nClara, however, would not acknowledge that she agreed with her\nfather; but she could not altogether restrain a feeling on her own\npart that her cousin's good humour towards her and Mr. Amedroz should\nhave been repressed by the tone of her letter to him. The man was to\ncome, however, and she would not judge of him until he was there.\n\nIn one house in the neighbourhood, and in only one, had Miss Amedroz\na friend with whom she was intimate; and as regarded even this single\nfriend, the intimacy was the effect rather of circumstances than of\nreal affection. She liked Mrs. Askerton, and saw her almost daily;\nbut she could hardly tell herself that she loved her neighbour.\n\nIn the little town of Belton, close to the church, there stood a\npretty, small house, called Belton Cottage. It was so near the church\nthat strangers always supposed it to be the parsonage; but the\nrectory stood away out in the country, half a mile from the town,\non the road to Redicote, and was a large house, three stories high,\nwith grounds of its own, and very ugly. Here lived the old bachelor\nrector, seventy years of age, given much to long absences when he\ncould achieve them, and never on good terms with his bishop. His two\ncurates lived at Redicote, where there was a second church. Belton\nCottage, which was occupied by Colonel Askerton and Mrs. Askerton,\nwas on the Amedroz property, and had been hired some two years since\nby the Colonel, who was then a stranger in the country and altogether\nunknown to the Belton people. But he had come there for shooting, and\ntherefore his coming had been understood. Even as long ago as two\nyears since, there had been neither use nor propriety in keeping the\nshooting for the squire's son, and it had been let with the cottage\nto Colonel Askerton. So Colonel Askerton had come there with his\nwife, and no one in the neighbourhood had known anything about them.\nMr. Amedroz, with his daughter, had called upon them, and gradually\nthere had grown up an intimacy between Clara and Mrs. Askerton. There\nwas an opening from the garden of Belton Cottage into the park, so\nthat familiar intercourse was easy, and Mrs. Askerton was a woman who\nknew well how to make herself pleasant to such another woman as Miss\nAmedroz.\n\nThe reader may as well know at once that rumours prejudicial to the\nAskertons reached Belton before they had been established there\nfor six months. At Taunton, which was twenty miles distant, these\nrumours were very rife, and there were people there who knew with\naccuracy,--though, probably without a grain of truth in their\naccuracy,--every detail in the history of Mrs. Askerton's life. And\nsomething, too, reached Clara's ears--something from old Mr. Wright,\nthe rector, who loved scandal, and was very ill-natured. \"A very\nnice woman,\" the rector had said; \"but she does not seem to have any\nbelongings in particular.\" \"She has got a husband,\" Clara had replied\nwith some little indignation, for she had never loved Mr. Wright.\n\"Yes; I suppose she has got a husband.\" Then Clara had, in her own\njudgment, accused the rector of lying, evil-speaking, and slandering,\nand had increased the measure of her cordiality to Mrs. Askerton. But\nsomething more she had heard on the same subject at Perivale. \"Before\nyou throw yourself into close intimacy with the lady, I think you\nshould know something about her,\" Mrs. Winterfield had said to her.\n\"I do know something about her; I know that she has the manners and\neducation of a lady, and that she is living affectionately with her\nhusband, who is devoted to her. What more ought I to know?\" \"If you\nreally do know all that, you know a great deal,\" Mrs. Winterfield had\nreplied.\n\n\"Do you know anything against her, aunt?\" Clara asked, after a pause.\n\nThere was another pause before Mrs. Winterfield answered. \"No\nmy dear; I cannot say that I do. But I think that young ladies,\nbefore they make intimate friendships, should be very sure of their\nfriends.\"\n\n\"You have already acknowledged that I know a great deal about her,\"\nClara replied. And then the conversation was at an end. Clara had not\nbeen quite ingenuous, as she acknowledged to herself. She was aware\nthat her aunt would not permit herself to repeat rumours as to the\ntruth of which she had no absolute knowledge. She understood that the\nweakness of her aunt's caution was due to the old lady's sense of\ncharity and dislike of slander. But Clara had buckled on her armour\nfor Mrs. Askerton, and was glad, therefore, to achieve her little\nvictory. When we buckle on our armour in any cause, we are apt to\ngo on buckling it, let the cause become as weak as it may; and\nClara continued her intimacy with Mrs. Askerton, although there was\nsomething in the lady's modes of speech, and something also in her\nmodes of thinking, which did not quite satisfy the aspirations of\nMiss Amedroz as to a friend.\n\nColonel Askerton himself was a pleasant, quiet man, who seemed to\nbe contented with the life which he was leading. For six weeks in\nApril and May he would go up to town, leaving Mrs. Askerton at the\ncottage,--as to which, probably jovial, absence in the metropolis\nthere seemed to be no spirit of grudging on the part of the wife. On\nthe first of September a friend would come to the cottage and remain\nthere for six weeks' shooting; and during the winter the Colonel and\nhis wife always went to Paris for a fortnight. Such had been their\nlife for the last two years; and thus,--so said Mrs. Askerton to\nClara,--did they intend to live as long as they could keep the\ncottage at Belton. Society at Belton they had none, and,--as they\nsaid,--desired none. Between them and Mr. Wright there was only a\nspeaking acquaintance. The married curate at Redicote would not\nlet his wife call on Mrs. Askerton, and the unmarried curate was a\nhard-worked, clerical hack,--a parochial minister at all times and\nseasons, who went to no houses except the houses of the poor, and who\nwould hold communion with no man, and certainly with no woman, who\nwould not put up with clerical admonitions for Sunday backslidings.\nMr. Amedroz himself neither received guests nor went as a guest to\nother men's houses. He would occasionally stand for a while at the\ngate of the Colonel's garden, and repeat the list of his own woes as\nlong as his neighbour would stand there to hear it. But there was no\nsociety at Belton, and Clara, as far as she herself was aware, was\nthe only person with whom Mrs. Askerton held any social intercourse,\nexcept what she might have during her short annual holiday in Paris.\n\n\"Of course, you are right,\" she said, when Clara told her of the\nproposed coming of Mr. Belton. \"If he turn out to be a good fellow,\nyou will have gained a great deal. And should he be a bad fellow,\nyou will have lost nothing. In either case you will know him, and\nconsidering how he stands towards you, that itself is desirable.\"\n\n\"But if he should annoy papa?\"\n\n\"In your papa's condition, my dear, the coming of any one will annoy\nhim. At least, he will say so; though I do not in the least doubt\nthat he will like the excitement better even than you will.\"\n\n\"I can't say there will be much excitement to me.\"\n\n\"No excitement in a young man's coming into the house! Without\nshocking your propriety, allow me to say that that is impossible. Of\ncourse, he is coming to see whether he can't make matters all right\nby marrying you.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Mrs. Askerton.\"\n\n\"Very well. Let it be nonsense. But why shouldn't he? It's just what\nhe ought to do. He hasn't got a wife; and, as far as I know, you\nhaven't got a lover.\"\n\n\"I certainly have not got a lover.\"\n\n\"Our religious nephew at Perivale does not seem to be of any use.\"\n\n\"I wish, Mrs. Askerton, you would not speak of Captain Aylmer in that\nway. I don't know any man whom I like so much, or at any rate better,\nthan Captain Aylmer; but I hate the idea that no girl can become\nacquainted with an unmarried man without having her name mentioned\nwith his, and having to hear ill-natured remarks of that kind.\"\n\n\"I hope you will learn to like this other man much better. Think how\nnice it will be to be mistress of the old place after all. And then\nto go back to the old family name! If I were you I would make up my\nmind not to let him leave the place till I had brought him to my\nfeet.\"\n\n\"If you go on like that I will not speak to you about him again.\"\n\n\"Or rather not to my feet,--for gentlemen have laid aside the humble\nway of making love for the last twenty years at least; but I don't\nknow whether the women haven't gained quite as much by the change as\nthe men.\"\n\n\"As I know nothing will stop you when you once get into a vein of\nthat kind, I shall go,\" said Clara. \"And till this man has come and\ngone I shall not mention his name again in your presence.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Mrs. Askerton; \"but as I will promise to say nothing\nmore about him, you need not go on his account.\" But Clara had got\nup, and did leave the cottage at once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nWILL BELTON.\n\n\nMr. Belton came to the castle, and nothing further had been said at\nthe cottage about his coming. Clara had seen Mrs. Askerton in the\nmeantime frequently, but that lady had kept her promise--almost to\nClara's disappointment. For she--though she had in truth disliked the\nproposition that her cousin could be coming with any special views\nwith reference to herself had nevertheless sufficient curiosity about\nthe stranger to wish to talk about him. Her father, indeed, mentioned\nBelton's name very frequently, saying something with reference to him\nevery time he found himself in his daughter's presence. A dozen times\nhe said that the man was heartless to come to the house at such a\ntime, and he spoke of his cousin always as though the man were guilty\nof a gross injustice in being heir to the property. But not the less\non that account did he fidget himself about the room in which Belton\nwas to sleep, about the food that Belton was to eat, and especially\nabout the wine that Belton was to drink. What was he to do for wine?\nThe stock of wine in the cellars at Belton Castle was, no doubt, very\nlow. The squire himself drank a glass or two of port daily, and had\nsome remnant of his old treasures by him, which might perhaps last\nhim his time; and occasionally there came small supplies of sherry\nfrom the grocer at Taunton; but Mr. Amedroz pretended to think that\nWill Belton would want champagne and claret;--and he would continue\nto make these suggestions in spite of his own repeated complaints\nthat the man was no better than an ordinary farmer. \"I've no doubt\nhe'll like beer,\" said Clara. \"Beer!\" said her father, and then\nstopped himself, as though he were lost in doubt whether it would\nbest suit him to scorn his cousin for having so low a taste as that\nsuggested on his behalf, or to ridicule his daughter's idea that the\nhousehold difficulty admitted of so convenient a solution.\n\nThe day of the arrival at last came, and Clara certainly was in a\ntwitter, although she had steadfastly resolved that she would be in\nno twitter at all. She had told her aunt by letter of the proposed\nvisit, and Mrs. Winterfield had expressed her approbation, saying\nthat she hoped it would lead to good results. Of what good results\ncould her aunt be thinking? The one probable good result would\nsurely be this--that relations so nearly connected should know each\nother. Why should there be any fuss made about such a visit? But,\nnevertheless, Clara, though she made no outward fuss, knew that\ninwardly she was not as calm about the man's coming as she would have\nwished herself to be.\n\nHe arrived about five o'clock in a gig from Taunton. Five was the\nordinary dinner hour at Belton, but it had been postponed till six on\nthis day, in the hope that the cousin might make his appearance at\nany rate by that hour. Mr. Amedroz had uttered various complaints\nas to the visitor's heartlessness in not having written to name the\nhour of his arrival, and was manifestly intending to make the most of\nthe grievance should he not present himself before six;--but this\nindulgence was cut short by the sound of the gig wheels. Mr. Amedroz\nand his daughter were sitting in a small drawing-room, which looked\nout to the front of the house and he, seated in his accustomed\nchair, near the window, could see the arrival. For a moment or two\nhe remained quiet in his chair, as though he would not allow so\ninsignificant a thing as his cousin's coming to ruffle him;--but he\ncould not maintain this dignified indifference, and before Belton was\nout of the gig he had shuffled out into the hall.\n\nClara followed her father almost unconsciously and soon found herself\nshaking hands with a big man, over six feet high, broad in the\nshoulders, large limbed, with bright quick grey eyes, a large mouth,\nteeth almost too perfect and a well-formed nose, with thick short\nbrown hair and small whiskers which came but half-way down his\ncheeks--a decidedly handsome man with a florid face, but still,\nperhaps, with something of the promised roughness of the farmer. But\na more good-humoured looking countenance Clara felt at once that she\nhad never beheld.\n\n\"And you are the little girl that I remember when I was a boy at Mr.\nFolliott's?\" he said. His voice was clear, and rather loud, but it\nsounded very pleasantly in that sad old house.\n\n\"Yes; I am the little girl,\" said Clara, smiling.\n\n\"Dear, dear! and that's twenty years ago now,\" said he.\n\n\"But you oughtn't to remind me of that, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"Oughtn't I? Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it shows how very old I am.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--to be sure. But there's nobody here that signifies. How\nwell I remember this room;--and the old tower out there. It isn't\nchanged a bit!\"\n\n\"Not to the outward eye, perhaps,\" said the squire.\n\n\"That's what I mean. So they're making hay still. Our hay has been\nall up these three weeks. I didn't know you ever meadowed the park.\"\nHere he trod with dreadful severity upon the corns of Mr. Amedroz,\nbut he did not perceive it. And when the squire muttered something\nabout a tenant, and the inconvenience of keeping land in his own\nhands, Belton would have gone on with the subject had not Clara\nchanged the conversation. The squire complained bitterly of this to\nClara when they were alone, saying that it was very heartless.\n\nShe had a little scheme of her own,--a plan arranged for the saying\nof a few words to her cousin on the earliest opportunity of their\nbeing alone together,--and she contrived that this should take place\nwithin half an hour after his arrival, as he went through the hall\nup to his room. \"Mr. Belton,\" she said, \"I'm sure you will not take\nit amiss if I take a cousin's privilege at once and explain to you\nsomething of our way of living here. My dear father is not very\nstrong.\"\n\n\"He is much altered since I saw him last.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Think of all that he has had to bear! Well, Mr. Belton,\nthe fact is, that we are not so well off as we used to be, and are\nobliged to live in a very quiet way. You will not mind that?\"\n\n\"Who? I?\"\n\n\"I take it very kind of you, your coming all this way to see us--\"\n\n\"I'd have come three times the distance.\"\n\n\"But you must put up with us as you find us, you know. The truth is\nwe are very poor.\"\n\n\"Well, now;--that's just what I wanted to know. One couldn't write\nand ask such a question; but I was sure I should find out if I came.\"\n\n\"You've found it out already, you see.\"\n\n\"As for being poor, it's a thing I don't think very much about,--not\nfor young people. But it isn't comfortable when a man gets old. Now\nwhat I want to know is this; can't something be done?\"\n\n\"The only thing to do is to be very kind to him. He has had to let\nthe park to Mr. Stovey, and he doesn't like talking about it.\"\n\n\"But if it isn't talked about, how can it be mended?\"\n\n\"It can't be mended.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that. But I'll be kind to him; you see if I ain't.\nAnd I'll tell you what, I'll be kind to you too, if you'll let me.\nYou have got no brother now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Clara; \"I have got no brother now.\" Belton was looking\nfull into her face, and saw that her eyes had become clouded with\ntears.\n\n\"I will be your brother,\" said he. \"You see if I don't. When I say\na thing I mean it. I will be your brother.\" And he took her hand,\ncaressing it, and showing her that he was not in the least afraid\nof her. He was blunt in his bearing, saying things which her father\nwould have called indelicate and heartless, as though they gave\nhim no effort, and placing himself at once almost in a position of\nascendency. This Clara had not intended. She had thought that her\nfarmer cousin, in spite of the superiority of his prospects as heir\nto the property, would have acceded to her little hints with silent\nacquiescence; but instead of this he seemed prepared to take upon\nhimself the chief part in the play that was to be acted between them.\n\"Shall it be so?\" he said, still holding her hand.\n\n\"You are very kind.\"\n\n\"I will be more than kind; I will love you dearly if you will let me.\nYou don't suppose that I have looked you up here for nothing. Blood\nis thicker than water, and you have nobody now so near to you as I\nam. I don't see why you should be so poor, as the debts have been\npaid.\"\n\n\"Papa has had to borrow money on his life interest in the place.\"\n\n\"That's the mischief! Never mind. We'll see if we can't do something.\nAnd in the meantime don't make a stranger of me. Anything does for\nme. Lord bless you! if you were to see how I rough it sometimes!\nI can eat beans and bacon with any one; and what's more, I can go\nwithout 'em if I can't get 'em.\"\n\n\"We'd better get ready for dinner now. I always dress, because papa\nlikes to see it.\" This she said as a hint to her cousin that he\nwould be expected to change his coat, for her father would have been\nannoyed had his guest sat down to dinner without such ceremony. Will\nBelton was not very good at taking hints; but he did understand this,\nand made the necessary change in his apparel.\n\nThe evening was long and dull, and nothing occurred worthy of remark\nexcept the surprise manifested by Mr. Amedroz when Belton called his\ndaughter by her Christian name. This he did without the slightest\nhesitation, as though it were the most natural thing in the world for\nhim to do. She was his cousin, and cousins of course addressed each\nother in that way. Clara's quick eye immediately saw her father's\nslight gesture of dismay, but Belton caught nothing of this. The\nsquire took an early opportunity of calling him Mr. Belton with some\nlittle peculiarity of expression; but this was altogether lost upon\nWill, who five times in the next five minutes addressed \"Clara\" as\nthough they were already on the most intimate terms. She would have\nanswered him in the same way, and would have called him Will, had she\nnot been afraid of offending her father.\n\nMr. Amedroz had declared his purpose of coming down to breakfast\nduring the period of his cousin's visit, and at half-past nine he was\nin the parlour. Clara had been there some time, but had not seen her\ncousin. He entered the room immediately after her father, bringing\nhis hat with him in his hand, and wiping the drops of perspiration\nfrom his brow. \"You have been out, Mr. Belton,\" said the squire.\n\n\"All round the place, sir. Six o'clock doesn't often find me in bed,\nsummer or winter. What's the use of laying in bed when one has had\nenough of sleep?\"\n\n\"But that's just the question,\" said Clara; \"whether one has had\nenough at six o'clock.\"\n\n\"Women want more than men, of course. A man, if he means to do any\ngood with land, must be out early. The grass will grow of itself at\nnights, but it wants looking after as soon as the daylight comes.\"\n\n\"I don't know that it would do much good to the grass here,\" said the\nsquire, mournfully.\n\n\"As much here as anywhere. And indeed I've got something to say about\nthat.\" He had now seated himself at the breakfast-table, and was\nplaying with his knife and fork. \"I think, sir, you're hardly making\nthe best you can out of the park.\"\n\n\"We won't mind talking about it, if you please,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Well; of course I won't, if you don't like it; but upon my word you\nought to look about you; you ought indeed.\"\n\n\"In what way do you mean?\" said Clara.\n\n\"If your father doesn't like to keep the land in his own hands, he\nshould let it to some one who would put stock in it,--not go on\ncutting it year after year, and putting nothing back, as this fellow\nwill do. I've been talking to Stovey, and that's just what he means.\"\n\n\"Nobody here has got money to put stock on the land,\" said the\nsquire, angrily.\n\n\"Then you should look for somebody somewhere else. That's all. I'll\ntell you what now, Mr. Amedroz, I'll do it myself.\" By this time he\nhad helped himself to two large slices of cold mutton, and was eating\nhis breakfast and talking with an equal amount of energy for either\noccupation.\n\n\"That's out of the question,\" said the squire.\n\n\"I don't see why it should be out of the question. It would be better\nfor you,--and better for me too, if this place is ever to be mine.\"\nOn hearing this the squire winced, but said nothing. This terrible\nfellow was so vehemently outspoken that the poor old man was\nabsolutely unable to keep pace with him,--even to the repeating\nof his wish that the matter should be talked of no further. \"I'll\ntell you what I'll do, now,\" continued Belton. \"There's altogether,\noutside the palings and in, about a hundred and fifty acres of\nit. I'll give you one pound two and sixpence an acre, and I won't\ncut an acre of grass inside the park;--no, nor much of it outside\neither;--only just enough to give me a little fodder for the cattle\nin winter.\"\n\n\"And give up Plaistow Hall?\" asked Clara.\n\n\"Lord love you, no. I've a matter of nine hundred acres on hand\nthere, and most of it under the plough. I've counted it up, and it\nwould just cost me a thousand pounds to stock this place. I should\ncome and look at it twice a year or so, and I should see my money\nhome again, if I didn't get any profit out of it.\"\n\nMr. Amedroz was astonished. The man had only been in his house one\nnight, and was proposing to take all his troubles off his hands. He\ndid not relish the proposition at all. He did not like to be accused\nof not doing as well for himself as others could do for him. He did\nnot wish to make any change,--although he remembered at the moment\nhis anger with Farmer Stovey respecting the haycarts. He did not\ndesire that the heir should have any immediate interest in the place.\nBut he was not strong enough to meet the proposition with a direct\nnegative. \"I couldn't get rid of Stovey in that way,\" he said,\nplaintively.\n\n\"I've settled it all with Stovey already,\" said Belton. \"He'll be\nglad enough to walk off with a twenty-pound note, which I'll give\nhim. He can't make money out of the place. He hasn't got means to\nstock it, and then see the wages that hay-making runs away with! He'd\nlose by it even at what he's paying, and he knows it. There won't be\nany difficulty about Stovey.\"\n\nBy twelve o'clock on that day Mr. Stovey had been brought into the\nhouse, and had resigned the land. It had been let to Mr. William\nBelton at an increased rental,--a rental increased by nearly forty\npounds per annum,--and that gentleman had already made many of his\narrangements for entering upon his tenancy. The twenty pounds had\nalready been paid to Stovey, and the transaction was complete. Mr.\nAmedroz sat in his chair bewildered, dismayed--and, as he himself\ndeclared,--shocked, quite shocked, at the precipitancy of the young\nman. It might be for the best. He didn't know. He didn't feel at\nall sure. But such hurrying in such a matter was, under all the\ncircumstances of the family, to say the least of it, very indelicate.\nHe was angry with himself for having yielded, and angry with Clara\nfor having allowed him to do so. \"It doesn't signify much,\" he said,\nat last. \"Of course he'll have it all to himself before long.\"\n\n\"But, papa, it really seems to be a much better arrangement for you.\nYou'll get more money--\"\n\n\"Money is not everything, my dear.\"\n\n\"But you'd sooner have Mr. Belton, our own cousin, about the place,\nthan Mr. Stovey.\"\n\n\"I don't know. We shall see. The thing is done now, and there is\nno use in complaining. I must say he hasn't shown a great deal of\ndelicacy.\"\n\nOn that afternoon Belton asked Clara to go out with him, and walk\nround the place. He had been again about the grounds, and had made\nplans, and counted up capabilities, and calculated his profit and\nlosses. \"If you don't dislike scrambling about,\" said he, \"I'll show\nyou everything that I intend to do.\"\n\n\"But I can't have any changes made, Mr. Belton,\" said Mr. Amedroz,\nwith some affectation of dignity in his manner. \"I won't have the\nfences moved, or anything of that kind.\"\n\n\"Nothing shall be done, sir, that you don't approve. I'll just manage\nit all as if I was acting as your own--bailiff.\" \"Son,\" he was going\nto say, but he remembered the fate of his cousin Charles just in time\nto prevent the use of the painful word.\n\n\"I don't want to have anything done,\" said Mr. Amedroz.\n\n\"Then nothing shall be done. We'll just mend a fence or two, to keep\nin the cattle, and leave other things as they are. But perhaps Clara\nwill walk out with me all the same.\"\n\nClara was quite ready to walk out, and had already tied on her hat\nand taken her parasol.\n\n\"Your father is a little nervous,\" said he, as soon as they were\nbeyond hearing of the house.\n\n\"Can you wonder at it, when you remember all that he has suffered?\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at it in the least; and I don't wonder at his\ndisliking me either.\"\n\n\"I don't think he dislikes you, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"Oh, but he does. Of course he does. I'm the heir to the place\ninstead of you. It is natural that he should dislike me. But I'll\nlive it down. You see if I don't. I'll make him so fond of me, he'll\nalways want to have me here. I don't mind a little dislike to begin\nwith.\"\n\n\"You're a wonderful man, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't call me Mr. Belton. But of course you must do\nas you please about that. If I can make him call me Will, I suppose\nyou'll call me so too.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; then I will.\"\n\n\"It don't much matter what a person is called; does it? Only one\nlikes to be friendly with one's friends. I suppose you don't like my\ncalling you Clara.\"\n\n\"Now you've begun you had better go on.\"\n\n\"I mean to. I make it a rule never to go back in the world. Your\nfather is half sorry that he has agreed about the place; but I shan't\nlet him off now. And I'll tell you what. In spite of what he says,\nI'll have it as different as possible before this time next year.\nWhy, there's lots of timber that ought to come out of the plantation;\nand there's places where the roots want stubbing up horribly. These\nthings always pay for themselves if they are properly done. Any good\ndone in the world always pays.\" Clara often remembered those words\nafterwards when she was thinking of her cousin's character. Any good\ndone in the world always pays!\n\n\"But you mustn't offend my father, even though it should do good,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"I understand,\" he answered. \"I won't tread on his toes. Where do you\nget your milk and butter?\"\n\n\"We buy them.\"\n\n\"From Stovey, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes; from Mr. Stovey. It goes against the rent.\"\n\n\"And it ought to go against the grain too,--living in the country and\npaying for milk! I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a cow.\nIt shall be a little present from me to you.\" He said nothing of\nthe more important present which this would entail upon him in the\nmatter of the grass for the cow; but she understood the nature of the\narrangement, and was anxious to prevent it.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Belton, I think we'd better not attempt that,\" she said.\n\n\"But we will attempt it. I've pledged myself to do nothing to oppose\nyour father; but I've made no such promise as to you. We'll have a\ncow before I'm many days older. What a pretty place this is! I do\nlike these rocks so much, and it is such a comfort to be off the\nflat.\"\n\n\"It is pretty.\"\n\n\"Very pretty. You've no conception what an ugly place Plaistow is.\nThe land isn't actual fen now, but it was once. And it's quite flat.\nAnd there is a great dike, twenty feet wide, oozing through it,--just\noozing, you know; and lots of little dikes, at right angles with the\nbig one. And the fields are all square. And there are no hedges,--and\nhardly a tree to be seen in the place.\"\n\n\"What a picture you have drawn! I should commit suicide if I lived\nthere.\"\n\n\"Not if you had so much to do as I have.\"\n\n\"And what is the house like?\"\n\n\"The house is good enough,--an old-fashioned manor-house, with high\nbrick chimneys, and brick gables, tiled all over, and large square\nwindows set in stone. The house is good enough, only it stands in the\nmiddle of a farm-yard. I said there were no trees, but there is an\navenue.\"\n\n\"Come, that's something.\"\n\n\"It was an old family seat, and they used to have avenues in those\ndays; but it doesn't lead up to the present hall door. It comes\nsideways up to the farm-yard; so that the whole thing must have\nbeen different once, and there must have been a great court-yard.\nIn Elizabeth's time Plaistow Manor was rather a swell place, and\nbelonged to some Roman Catholics who came to grief, and then the\nHowards got it. There's a whole history about it, only I don't much\ncare about those things.\"\n\n\"And is it yours now?\"\n\n\"It's between me and my uncle, and I pay him rent for his part. He's\na clergyman you know, and he has a living in Lincolnshire,--not far\noff.\"\n\n\"And do you live alone in that big house?\"\n\n\"There's my sister. You've heard of Mary;--haven't you?\"\n\nThen Clara remembered that there was a Miss Belton,--a poor sickly\ncreature, with a twisted spine and a hump back, as to whose welfare\nshe ought to have made inquiries.\n\n\"Oh, yes; of course,\" said Clara. \"I hope she's better than she used\nto be,--when we heard of her.\"\n\n\"She'll never be better. But then she does not become much worse.\nI think she does grow a little weaker. She's older than I am, you\nknow,--two years older; but you would think she was quite an old\nwoman to look at her.\" Then, for the next half-hour, they talked\nabout Mary Belton as they visited every corner of the place. Belton\nstill had an eye to business as he went on talking, and Clara\nremarked how many sticks he moved as he went, how many stones he\nkicked on one side, and how invariably he noted any defect in the\nfences. But still he talked of his sister, swearing that she was as\ngood as gold, and at last wiping away the tears from his eyes as he\ndescribed her maladies. \"And yet I believe she is better off than any\nof us,\" he said, \"because she is so good.\" Clara began to wish that\nshe had called him Will from the beginning, because she liked him\nso much. He was just the man to have for a cousin,--a true loving\ncousin, stalwart, self-confident, with a grain or two of tyranny in\nhis composition as becomes a man in relation to his intimate female\nrelatives; and one, moreover, with whom she could trust herself to\nbe familiar without any danger of love-making! She saw his character\nclearly, and told herself that she understood it perfectly. He was a\njewel of a cousin, and she must begin to call him Will as speedily as\npossible.\n\nAt last they came round in their walk to the gate leading into\nColonel Askerton's garden; and here in the garden, close to the gate,\nthey found Mrs. Askerton. I fancy that she had been watching for\nthem, or at any rate watching for Clara, so that she might know how\nher friend was carrying herself with her cousin. She came at once to\nthe wicket, and there she was introduced by Clara to Mr. Belton. Mr.\nBelton as he made his bow muttered something awkwardly, and seemed\nto lose his self-possession for the moment. Mrs. Askerton was very\ngracious to him, and she knew well how to be both gracious and\nungracious. She talked about the scenery, and the charms of the\nold place, and the dullness of the people around them, and the\ninexpediency of looking for society in country places; till after\nawhile Mr. Belton was once more at his ease.\n\n\"How is Colonel Askerton?\" asked Clara.\n\n\"He's in-doors. Will you come and see him? He's reading a French\nnovel, as usual. It's the only thing he ever does in summer. Do you\never read French novels, Mr. Belton?\"\n\n\"I read very little at all, and when I do I read English.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're a man who has a pursuit in life, no doubt.\"\n\n\"I should rather think so,--that is, if you mean, by a pursuit,\nearning my bread. A man has not much time for French novels with a\nthousand acres of land on his hands; even if he knew how to read\nFrench, which I don't.\"\n\n\"But you're not always at work on your farm?\"\n\n\"It's pretty constant, Mrs. Askerton. Then I shoot, and hunt.\"\n\n\"You're a sportsman?\"\n\n\"All men living in the country are,--more or less.\"\n\n\"Colonel Askerton shoots a great deal. He has the shooting of Belton,\nyou know. He'll be delighted, I'm sure, to see you if you are here\nsome time in September. But you, coming from Norfolk, would not care\nfor partridge-shooting in Somersetshire.\"\n\n\"I don't see why it shouldn't be as good here as there.\"\n\n\"Colonel Askerton thinks he has got a fair head of game upon the\nplace.\"\n\n\"I dare say. Game is easily kept if people knew how to set about it.\"\n\n\"Colonel Askerton has a very good keeper, and has gone to a great\ndeal of expense since he has been here.\"\n\n\"I'm my own head-keeper,\" said Belton; \"and so I will be,--or rather\nshould be, if I had this place.\"\n\nSomething in the lady's tone had grated against his feelings and\noffended him; or perhaps he thought that she assumed too many of the\nairs of proprietorship because the shooting of the place had been let\nto her husband for thirty pounds a-year.\n\n\"I hope you don't mean to say you'll turn us out,\" said Mrs.\nAskerton, laughing.\n\n\"I have no power to turn anybody out or in,\" said he. \"I've got\nnothing to do with it.\"\n\nClara, perceiving that matters were not going quite pleasantly\nbetween her old and new friend, thought it best to take her\ndeparture. Belton, as he went, lifted his hat from his head, and\nClara could not keep herself from thinking that he was not only very\nhandsome, but that he looked very much like a gentleman, in spite of\nhis occupation as a farmer.\n\n\"By-bye, Clara,\" said Mrs. Askerton; \"come down and see me to-morrow,\nthere's a dear. Don't forget what a dull life I have of it.\" Clara\nsaid that she would come. \"And I shall be so happy to see Mr. Belton\nif he will call before he leaves you.\" At this Belton again raised\nhis hat from his head, and muttered some word or two of civility. But\nthis, his latter muttering, was different from the first, for he had\naltogether regained his presence of mind.\n\n\"You didn't seem to get on very well with my friend,\" said Clara,\nlaughing, as soon as they had turned away from the cottage.\n\n\"Well, no;--that is to say, not particularly well or particularly\nbadly. At first I took her for somebody else I knew slightly ever so\nlong ago, and I was thinking of that other person at the time.\"\n\n\"And what was the other person's name?\"\n\n\"I can't even remember that at the present moment.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton was a Miss Oliphant.\"\n\n\"That wasn't the other lady's name. But, independently of that, they\ncan't be the same. The other lady married a Mr. Berdmore.\"\n\n\"A Mr. Berdmore!\" Clara as she repeated the name felt convinced that\nshe had heard it before, and that she had heard it in connection\nwith Mrs. Askerton. She certainly had heard the name of Berdmore\npronounced, or had seen it written, or had in some shape come across\nthe name in Mrs. Askerton's presence; or at any rate somewhere on\nthe premises occupied by that lady. More than this she could not\nremember; but the name, as she had now heard it from her cousin,\nbecame at once distinctly connected in her memory with her friends at\nthe cottage.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Belton; \"a Mr. Berdmore. I knew more of him than of her,\nthough for the matter of that, I knew very little of him either. She\nwas a fast-going girl, and his friends were very sorry. But I think\nthey are both dead or divorced, or that they have come to grief in\nsome way.\"\n\n\"And is Mrs. Askerton like the fast-going lady?\"\n\n\"In a certain way. Not that I remember what the fast-going lady was\nlike; but there was something about this woman that put me in mind of\nthe other. Vigo was her name; now I recollect it,--a Miss Vigo. It's\nnine or ten years ago now, and I was little more than a boy.\"\n\n\"Her name was Oliphant.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose they have anything to do with each other. What riled\nme was the way she talked of the shooting. People do when they take\na little shooting. They pay some trumpery thirty or forty pounds a\nyear, and then they seem to think that it's almost the same as though\nthey owned the property themselves. I've known a man talk of his\nmanor because he had the shooting of a wood and a small farm round\nit. They are generally shopkeepers out of London, gin distillers, or\nbrewers, or people like that.\"\n\n\"Why, Mr. Belton, I didn't think you could be so furious!\"\n\n\"Can't I? When my back's up, it is up! But it isn't up yet.\"\n\n\"And I hope it won't be up while you remain in Somersetshire.\"\n\n\"I won't answer for that. There's Stovey's empty cart standing\njust where it stood yesterday; and he promised he'd have it home\nbefore three to-day. My back will be up with him if he doesn't mind\nhimself.\"\n\nIt was nearly six o'clock when they got back to the house, and Clara\nwas surprised to find that she had been out three hours with her\ncousin. Certainly it had been very pleasant. The usual companion\nof her walks, when she had a companion, was Mrs. Askerton; but Mrs.\nAskerton did not like real walking. She would creep about the grounds\nfor an hour or so, and even such companionship as that was better to\nClara than absolute solitude; but now she had been carried about the\nplace, getting over stiles and through gates, and wandering through\nthe copses, till she was tired and hungry, and excited and happy.\n\"Oh, papa,\" she said, \"we have had such a walk!\"\n\n\"I thought we were to have dined at five,\" he replied, in a low\nwailing voice.\n\n\"No, papa, indeed,--indeed you said six.\"\n\n\"That was for yesterday.\"\n\n\"You said we were to make it six while Mr. Belton was here.\"\n\n\"Very well;--if it must be, I suppose it must be.\"\n\n\"You don't mean on my account,\" said Will. \"I'll undertake to eat\nmy dinner, sir, at any hour that you'll undertake to give it me. If\nthere's a strong point about me at all, it is my appetite.\"\n\nClara, when she went to her father's room that evening, told him what\nMr. Belton had said about the shooting, knowing that her father's\nfeelings would agree with those which had been expressed by her\ncousin. Mr. Amedroz of course made this an occasion for further\ngrumbling, suggesting that Belton wanted to get the shooting for\nhimself as he had got the farm. But, nevertheless, the effect which\nClara had intended was produced, and before she left him he had\nabsolutely proposed that the shooting and the land should go\ntogether.\n\n\"I'm sure that Mr. Belton doesn't mean that at all,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I don't care what he means,\" said the squire.\n\n\"And it wouldn't do to treat Colonel Askerton in that way,\" said\nClara.\n\n\"I shall treat him just as I like,\" said the squire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nSAFE AGAINST LOVE-MAKING.\n\n\nA dear cousin, and safe against love-making! This was Clara's verdict\nrespecting Will Belton, as she lay thinking of him in bed that night.\nWhy that warranty against love-making should be a virtue in her eyes\nI cannot, perhaps, explain. But all young ladies are apt to talk\nto themselves in such phrases about gentlemen with whom they are\nthrown into chance intimacy;--as though love-making were in itself\na thing injurious and antagonistic to happiness, instead of being,\nas it is, the very salt of life. Safe against love-making! And yet\nMrs. Askerton, her friend, had spoken of the probability of such\nlove-making as being the great advantage of his coming. And there\ncould not be a second opinion as to the expediency of a match between\nher and her cousin in a worldly point of view. Clara, moreover,\nhad already perceived that he was a man fit to guide a wife, very\ngood-humoured,--and good-tempered also, anxious to give pleasure to\nothers, a man of energy and forethought, who would be sure to do well\nin the world and hold his head always high among his fellows;--as\ngood a husband as a girl could have. Nevertheless, she congratulated\nherself in that she felt satisfied that he was safe against\nlove-making! Might it be possible that that pressing of hands at\nTaunton had been so tender, and those last words spoken with Captain\nAylmer so soft, that on his account she felt delighted to think that\nher cousin was warranted not to make love?\n\nAnd what did Will Belton think about his cousin, insured as he was\nthus supposed to be against the dangers of love? He, also, lay awake\nfor awhile that night, thinking over this new friendship. Or rather\nhe thought of it walking about his room, and looking out at the\nbright harvest moon;--for with him to be in bed was to be asleep.\nHe sat himself down, and he walked about, and he leaned out of the\nwindow into the cool night air; and he made some comparisons in his\nmind, and certain calculations; and he thought of his present home,\nand of his sister, and of his future prospects as they were concerned\nwith the old place at which he was now staying; and he portrayed to\nhimself, in his mind, Clara's head and face and figure and feet;--and\nhe resolved that she should be his wife. He had never seen a girl who\nseemed to suit him so well. Though he had only been with her for a\nday, he swore to himself that he knew he could love her. Nay;--he\nswore to himself that he did love her. Then,--when he had quite made\nup his mind, he tumbled into his bed and was asleep in five minutes.\n\nMiss Amedroz was a handsome young woman, tall, well-made, active, and\nfull of health. She carried herself as though she thought her limbs\nwere made for use, and not simply for ease upon a sofa. Her head and\nneck stood well upon her shoulders, and her waist showed none of\nthose waspish proportions of which ladies used to be more proud than\nI believe them to be now, in their more advanced state of knowledge\nand taste. There was much about her in which she was like her cousin,\nas though the blood they had in common between them had given to both\nthe same proportions and the same comeliness. Her hair was of a dark\nbrown colour, as was his. Her eyes were somewhat darker than his,\nand perhaps not so full of constant movement; but they were equally\nbright, and possessed that quick power of expressing tenderness which\nbelonged to them. Her nose was more finely cut, as was also her chin,\nand the oval of her face; but she had the same large expressive\nmouth, and the same perfection of ivory-white teeth. As has been said\nbefore, Clara Amedroz, who was now nearly twenty-six years of age,\nwas not a young-looking young woman. To the eyes of many men that\nwould have been her fault; but in the eyes of Belton it was no fault.\nHe had not made himself fastidious as to women by much consort with\nthem, and he was disposed to think that she who was to become his\nwife had better be something more than a girl not long since taken\nout of the nursery. He was well to do in the world, and could\nsend his wife out in her carriage, with all becoming bravery of\nappurtenances. And he would do so, too, when he should have a wife.\nBut still he would look to his wife to be a useful partner to him.\nShe should be a woman not above agricultural solicitude, or too proud\nto have a care for her cows. Clara, he was sure, had no false pride;\nand yet,--as he was sure also, she was at every point such a lady as\nwould do honour to the carriage and the bravery when it should be\nforthcoming. And then such a marriage as this would put an end to all\nthe trouble which he felt in reference to the entail on the estate.\nHe knew that he was to be master of Belton, and of course had,\nin that knowledge, the satisfaction which men do feel from the\nconsciousness of their future prosperity. And this with him was\nenhanced by a strong sympathy with old-fashioned prejudices as to\nfamily. He would be Belton of Belton; and there had been Beltons of\nBelton in old days, for a longer time backwards than he was able to\ncount. But still the prospect had not been without its alloy, and he\nhad felt real distress at the idea of turning his cousin out of her\nfather's house. Such a marriage as that he now contemplated would put\nall these things right.\n\nWhen he got up in the morning he was quite as keen about it as he had\nbeen on the previous evening;--and as he thought about it the more,\nhe became keener and still more keen. On the previous evening, as he\nwas leaning out of the window endeavouring to settle in his own mind\nwhat would be the proper conduct of the romance of the thing, he had\nconsidered that he had better not make his proposal quite at once.\nHe was to remain eight days at Belton, and as eight days was not a\nlong period of acquaintance, he had reflected that it might be well\nfor him to lay what foundation for love it might be in his power to\nconstruct during his present sojourn, and then return and complete\nthe work before Christmas. But as he was shaving himself, the\nhabitual impatience of his nature predominated, and he became\ndisposed to think that delay would be useless, and might perhaps be\ndangerous. It might be possible that Clara would be unable to give\nhim a decisive answer so quickly as to enable him to return home an\naccepted lover; but if such doubt were left, such doubt would give\nhim an excuse for a speedy return to Belton. He did not omit to tell\nhimself that very probably he might not succeed at all. He was a man\nnot at all apt to feel assurance that he could carry all before him\nin love. But in this matter, as in all others which required from him\nany personal effort, he prepared himself to do his best, leaving the\nconsequences to follow as they might. When he threw his seed corn\ninto the earth with all such due appliances of agricultural skill and\nindustry as his capital and experience enabled him to use, he did his\npart towards the production of next year's crop; and after that he\nmust leave it to a higher Power to give to him, or to withhold from\nhim, the reward of his labour. He had found that, as a rule, the\nreward had been given when the labour had been honest; and he was now\nprepared to follow the same plan, with the same hopes, in this matter\nof his love-making.\n\nAfter much consideration,--very much consideration, a consideration\nwhich took him the whole time that he was brushing his hair and\nwashing his teeth,--he resolved that he would, in the first instance,\nspeak to Mr. Amedroz. Not that he intended that the father should win\nthe daughter for him. He had an idea that he would like to do that\nwork for himself. But he thought that the old squire would be better\npleased if his consent were asked in the first instance. The present\nday was Sunday, and he would not speak on the subject till Monday.\nThis day he would devote to the work of securing his future\nfather-in-law's good opinion; to that,--and to his prayers.\n\nAnd he had gained very much upon Mr. Amedroz before the evening\nof the day was over. He was a man before whom difficulties seemed\nto yield, and who had his own way simply because he had become\naccustomed to ask for it,--to ask for it and to work for it. He had\nso softened the squire's tone of thought towards him, that the future\nstocking of the land was spoken of between them with something like\nenergy on both sides; and Mr. Amedroz had given his consent, without\nany difficulty, to the building of a shed for winter stall-feeding.\nClara sat by listening, and perceived that Will Belton would soon be\nallowed to do just what he pleased with the place. Her father talked\nas she had not heard him talk since her poor brother's death, and\nwas quite animated on the subject of woodcraft. \"We don't know much\nabout timber down where I am,\" said Will, \"just because we've got no\ntrees.\"\n\n\"I'll show you your way,\" said the old man. \"I've managed the timber\non the estate myself for the last forty years.\" Will Belton of course\ndid not say a word as to the gross mismanagement which had been\napparent even to him. What a cousin he was! Clara thought,--what a\nparagon among cousins! And then he was so manifestly safe against\nlove-making! So safe, that he only cared to talk about timber, and\noxen, and fences, and winter-forage! But it was all just as it ought\nto be; and if her father did not call him Will before long, she\nherself would set the way by doing so first. A very paragon among\ncousins!\n\n\"What a flatterer you are,\" she said to him that night.\n\n\"A flatterer! I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you. You have flattered papa out of all his animosity already.\nI shall be jealous soon; for he'll think more of you than of me.\"\n\n\"I hope he'll come to think of us as being nearly equally near to\nhim,\" said Belton, with a tone that was half serious and half tender.\nNow that he had made up his mind, he could not keep his hand from the\nwork before him an instant. But Clara had also made up her mind, and\nwould not be made to think that her cousin could mean anything that\nwas more than cousinly.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" she said, laughing, \"that is very cool on your part.\"\n\n\"I came here determined to be friends with him at any rate.\"\n\n\"And you did so without any thought of me. But you said you would be\nmy brother, and I shall not forget your promise. Indeed, indeed, I\ncannot tell you how glad I am that you have come,--both for papa's\nsake and my own. You have done him so much good that I only dread to\nthink that you are going so soon.\"\n\n\"I'll be back before long. I think nothing of running across here\nfrom Norfolk. You'll see enough of me before next summer.\"\n\nSoon after breakfast on the next morning he got Mr. Amedroz out into\nthe grounds, on the plea of showing him the proposed site for the\ncattle shed; but not a word was said about the shed on that occasion.\nHe went to work at his other task at once, and when that was well on\nhand the squire was quite unfitted for the consideration of any less\nimportant matter, however able to discuss it Belton might have been\nhimself.\n\n\"I've got something particular that I want to say to you, sir,\"\nBelton began.\n\nNow Mr. Amedroz was of opinion that his cousin had been saying\nsomething very particular ever since his arrival, and was rather\nfrightened at this immediate prospect of a new subject.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong; is there?\"\n\n\"No, nothing wrong;--at least, I hope it's not wrong. Would not it be\na good plan, sir, if I were to marry my cousin Clara?\"\n\nWhat a terrible young man! Mr. Amedroz felt that his breath was so\ncompletely taken away from him that he was quite unable to speak a\nword of answer at the moment. Indeed, he was unable to move, and\nstood still, where he had been fixed by the cruel suddenness of the\nproposition made to him.\n\n\"Of course I know nothing of what she may think about it,\" continued\nBelton. \"I thought it best to come to you before I spoke a word to\nher. And I know that in many ways she is above me. She is better\neducated, and reads more, and all that sort of thing. And it may be\nthat she'd rather marry a London man than a fellow who passes all\nhis time in the country. But she couldn't get one who would love her\nbetter or treat her more kindly. And then as to the property; you\nmust own it would be a good arrangement. You'd like to know it would\ngo to your own child and your own grandchild;--wouldn't you, sir? And\nI'm not badly off, without looking to this place at all, and could\ngive her everything she wants. But then I don't know that she'd care\nto marry a farmer.\" These last words he said in a melancholy tone, as\nthough aware that he was confessing his own disgrace.\n\nThe squire had listened to it all, and had not as yet said a word.\nAnd now, when Belton ceased, he did not know what word to speak. He\nwas a man whose thoughts about women were chivalrous, and perhaps a\nlittle old-fashioned. Of course, when a man contemplates marriage,\nhe could do nothing better, nothing more honourable, than consult\nthe lady's father in the first instance. But he felt that even a\nfather should be addressed on such a subject with great delicacy.\nThere should be ambages in such a matter. The man who resolved to\ncommit himself to such a task should come forward with apparent\ndifficulty,--with great diffidence, and even with actual difficulty.\nHe should keep himself almost hidden, as behind a mask, and should\ntell of his own ambition with doubtful, quivering voice. And the\nambages should take time. He should approach the citadel to be taken\nwith covered ways,--working his way slowly and painfully. But this\nyoung man, before he had been in the house three days, said all\nthat he had to say without the slightest quaver in his voice, and\nevidently expected to get an answer about the squire's daughter as\nquickly as he had got it about the squire's land.\n\n\"You have surprised me very much,\" said the old man at last, drawing\nhis breath.\n\n\"I'm quite in earnest about it. Clara seems to me to be the very girl\nto make a good wife to such a one as I am. She's got everything that\na woman ought to have;--by George she has!\"\n\n\"She is a good girl, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"She is as good as gold, every inch of her.\"\n\n\"But you have not known her very long, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"Quite long enough for my purposes. You see I knew all about her\nbeforehand,--who she is, and where she comes from. There's a great\ndeal in that, you know.\"\n\nMr. Amedroz shuddered at the expressions used. It was grievous to\nhim to hear his daughter spoken of as one respecting whom some one\nknew who she was and whence she came. Such knowledge respecting the\ndaughter of such a family was, as a matter of course, common to all\npolite persons. \"Yes,\" said Mr. Amedroz, stiffly: \"you know as much\nas that about her, certainly.\"\n\n\"And she knows as much about me. Now the question is, whether you\nhave any objection to make?\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Belton, you have taken me so much by surprise that I do\nnot feel myself competent to answer you at once.\"\n\n\"Shall we say in an hour's time, sir?\" An hour's time! Mr. Amedroz,\nif he could have been left to his own guidance, would have thought a\nmonth very little for such a work.\n\n\"I suppose you would wish me to see Clara first,\" said Mr. Amedroz.\n\n\"Oh dear, no. I would much rather ask her myself;--if only I could\nget your consent to my doing so.\"\n\n\"And you have said nothing to her?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that. You would have behaved badly, I think, had you\ndone so while staying under my roof.\"\n\n\"I thought it best, at any rate, to come to you first. But as I must\nbe back at Plaistow on this day week, I haven't much time to lose. So\nif you could think about it this afternoon, you know--\"\n\nMr. Amedroz, much bewildered, promised that he would do his best, and\neventually did bring himself to give an answer on the next morning.\n\"I have been thinking about this all night,\" said Mr. Amedroz.\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you,\" said Belton, feeling rather\nashamed of his own remissness as he remembered how soundly he had\nhimself slept.\n\n\"If you are quite sure of yourself--\"\n\n\"Do you mean sure of loving her? I am as sure of that as anything.\"\n\n\"But men are so apt to change their fancies.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about my fancies; but I don't often change my\npurpose when I'm in earnest. In such a matter as this I couldn't\nchange. I'll say as much as that for myself, though it may seem\nbold.\"\n\n\"Of course, in regard to money such a marriage would be advantageous\nto my child. I don't know whether you know it, but I shall have\nnothing to give her--literally nothing.\"\n\n\"All the better, sir, as far as I am concerned. I'm not one who wants\nto be saved from working by a wife's fortune.\"\n\n\"But most men like to get something when they marry.\"\n\n\"I want to get nothing;--nothing, that is, in the way of money. If\nClara becomes my wife I'll never ask you for one shilling.\"\n\n\"I hope her aunt will do something for her.\" This the old man said in\na wailing voice, as though the expression of such a hope was grievous\nto him.\n\n\"If she becomes my wife, Mrs. Winterfield will be quite at liberty to\nleave her money elsewhere.\" There were old causes of dislike between\nMr. Belton and Mrs. Winterfield, and even now Mrs. Winterfield was\nalmost offended because Mr. Belton was staying at Belton Castle.\n\n\"But all that is quite uncertain,\" continued Mr. Amedroz.\n\n\"And I have your leave to speak to Clara myself?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Belton; yes; I think so. I do not see why you should not\nspeak to her. But I fear you are a little too precipitate. Clara has\nknown you so very short a time, that you can hardly have a right to\nhope that she should learn to regard you at once as you would have\nher do.\" As he heard this, Belton's face became long and melancholy.\nHe had taught himself to think that he could dispense with that delay\ntill Christmas which he had at first proposed to himself, and that he\nmight walk into the arena at once, and perhaps win the battle in the\nfirst round. \"Three days is such a very short time,\" said the squire.\n\n\"It is short certainly,\" said Belton.\n\nThe father's leave was however given, and armed with that, Belton was\nresolved that he would take, at any rate, some preliminary steps in\nlove-making before he returned to Plaistow. What would be the nature\nof the preliminary steps taken by such a one as him, the reader by\nthis time will probably be able to surmise.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nNOT SAFE AGAINST LOVE-MAKING.\n\n\n\"Why don't you call him Will?\" Clara said to her father. This\nquestion was asked on the evening of that Monday on which Mr. Amedroz\nhad given his consent as to the marriage proposal.\n\n\"Call him Will! Why should I?\"\n\n\"You used to do so, when he was a boy.\"\n\n\"Of course I did; but that is years ago. He would think it\nimpertinent now.\"\n\n\"Indeed he would not; he would like it. He has told me so. It sounds\nso cold to him to be called Mr. Belton by his relations.\"\n\nThe father looked at his daughter as though for a moment he almost\nsuspected that matters had really been arranged between her and her\nfuture lover without his concurrence, and before his sanction had\nbeen obtained. But if for a moment such a thought did cross his mind,\nit did not dwell there. He trusted Belton; but as to his daughter, he\nknew that he might be sure of her. It would be impossible with her to\nkeep such a secret from him, even for half a day. And yet, how odd\nit was! Here was a man who in three days had fallen in love with his\ndaughter; and here was his daughter apparently quite as ready to be\nin love with the man. How could she, who was ordinarily circumspect,\nand almost cold in her demeanour towards strangers--who was from\ncircumstances and from her own disposition altogether hostile to\nflirting intimacies--how could his Clara have changed her nature\nso speedily? The squire did not understand it, but was prepared to\nbelieve that it was all for the best. \"I'll call him Will, if you\nlike it,\" said he.\n\n\"Do, papa, and then I can do so also. He is such a good fellow, and\nI am so fond of him.\"\n\nOn the next morning Mr. Amedroz did, with much awkwardness, call\nhis guest by his Christian name. Clara caught her cousin's eye and\nsmiled, and he also smiled. At that moment he was more in love than\never. Could anything be more charming than this? Immediately after\nbreakfast he was going over to Redicote, to see a builder in a small\nway who lived there, and whom he proposed to employ in putting up the\nshed for the cattle; but he almost begrudged the time, so anxious was\nhe to begin his suit. But his plan had been laid out and he would\nfollow it. \"I think I shall be back by three o'clock,\" he said to\nClara, \"and then we'll have our walk.\"\n\n\"I'll be ready; and you can call for me at Mrs. Askerton's. I must go\ndown there, and it will save you something in your walk to pick me up\nat the cottage.\" And so the arrangements for the day were made.\n\nClara had promised that she would soon call at the cottage, and was,\nindeed, rather anxious to see Mrs. Askerton on her own account. What\nshe had heard from her cousin as to a certain Miss Vigo of old days\nhad interested her, and also what she had heard of a certain Mr.\nBerdmore. It had been evident to her that her cousin had thought\nlittle about it. The likeness of the lady he then saw to the lady he\nhad before known, had at first struck him; but when he found that the\ntwo ladies were not represented by one and the same person, he was\nsatisfied, and there was an end of the matter for him. But it was\nnot so with Clara. Her feminine mind dwelt on the matter with more\nearnestness than he had cared to entertain, and her clearer intellect\nsaw possibilities which did not occur to him. But it was not till\nshe found herself walking across the park to the cottage that\nshe remembered that any inquiries as to her past life might be\ndisagreeable to Mrs. Askerton. She had thought of asking her friend\nplainly whether the names of Vigo and Berdmore had ever been familiar\nto her; but she reminded herself that there had been rumours afloat,\nand that there might be a mystery. Mrs. Askerton would sometimes talk\nof her early life; but she would do this with dreamy, indistinct\nlanguage, speaking of the sorrows of her girlhood, but not specifying\ntheir exact nature, seldom mentioning any names, and never referring\nwith clear personality to those who had been nearest to her when\nshe had been a child. Clara had seen her friend's maiden name, Mary\nOliphant, written in a book, and seeing it had alluded to it. On\nthat occasion Mrs. Askerton had spoken of herself as having been an\nOliphant, and thus Clara had come to know the fact. But now, as she\nmade her way to the cottage, she remembered that she had learned\nnothing more than this as to Mrs. Askerton's early life. Such being\nthe case, she hardly knew how to ask any question about the two names\nthat had been mentioned. And yet, why should she not ask such a\nquestion? Why should she doubt Mrs. Askerton? And if she did doubt,\nwhy should not her doubts be solved?\n\nShe found Colonel Askerton and his wife together, and she certainly\nwould ask no such question in his presence. He was a slight built,\nwiry man, about fifty, with iron-grey hair and beard,--who seemed to\nhave no trouble in life, and to desire but few pleasures. Nothing\ncould be more regular than the course of his days, and nothing more\nidle. He breakfasted at eleven, smoked and read till the afternoon,\nwhen he rode for an hour or two; then he dined, read again, smoked\nagain, and went to bed. In September and October he shot, and twice\nin the year, as has been before stated, went away to seek a little\nexcitement elsewhere. He seemed to be quite contented with his lot,\nand was never heard to speak an angry word to any one. Nobody cared\nfor him much; but then he troubled himself with no one's affairs. He\nnever went to church, and had not eaten or drank in any house but his\nown since he had come to Belton.\n\n\"Oh, Clara, you naughty girl,\" said Mrs. Askerton, \"why didn't you\ncome yesterday? I was expecting you all day.\"\n\n\"I was busy. Really, we've grown to be quite industrious people since\nmy cousin came.\"\n\n\"They tell me he's taking the land into his own hands,\" said the\nColonel.\n\n\"Yes, indeed; and he is going to build sheds, and buy cattle; and\nI don't know what he doesn't mean to do; so that we shall be alive\nagain.\"\n\n\"I hope he won't want my shooting.\"\n\n\"He has shooting of his own in Norfolk,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Then he'll hardly care to come here for that purpose. When I heard\nof his proceedings I began to be afraid.\"\n\n\"I don't think he would do anything to annoy you for the world,\" said\nClara, enthusiastically. \"He's the most unselfish person I ever met.\"\n\n\"He'd have a perfect right to take the shooting if he liked it,--that\nis always supposing that he and your father agreed about it.\"\n\n\"They agree about everything now. He has altogether disarmed papa's\nprejudices, and it seems to be recognised that he is to have his own\nway about the place. But I don't think he'll interfere about the\nshooting.\"\n\n\"He won't, my dear, if you ask him not,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"I'll ask him in a moment if Colonel Askerton wishes it.\"\n\n\"Oh dear no,\" said he. \"It would be teaching the ostler to grease the\nhorse's teeth. Perhaps he hasn't thought of it.\"\n\n\"He thinks of everything,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I wonder whether he's thinking of--\" So far Mrs. Askerton spoke,\nand then she paused. Colonel Askerton looked up at Clara with an\nill-natured smile, and Clara felt that she blushed. Was it not cruel\nthat she could not say a word in favour of a friend and a cousin,--a\ncousin who had promised to be a brother to her, without being treated\nwith such words and such looks as these? But she was determined not\nto be put down. \"I'm quite sure of this,\" she said, \"that my cousin\nwould do nothing unfair or ungentlemanlike.\"\n\n\"There would be nothing unfair or ungentlemanlike in it. I shouldn't\ntake it amiss at all;--but I should simply take up my bed and walk.\nPray tell him that I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing him\nbefore he goes. I did call yesterday, but he was out.\"\n\n\"He'll be here soon. He's to come here for me.\" But Colonel\nAskerton's horse was brought to the door, and he could not therefore\nwait to make Mr. Belton's acquaintance on that occasion.\n\n\"What a phoenix this cousin of yours is,\" said Mrs. Askerton, as\nsoon as her husband was gone.\n\n\"He is a splendid fellow;--he is indeed. There's so much life about\nhim! He's always doing something. He says that doing good will always\npay in the long run. Isn't that a fine doctrine?\"\n\n\"Quite a practical phoenix!\"\n\n\"It has done papa so much good! At this moment he's out somewhere,\nthinking of what is going on, instead of moping in the house. He\ncouldn't bear the idea of Will's coming, and now he is already\nbeginning to complain because he's going away.\"\n\n\"Will, indeed!\"\n\n\"And why not Will? He's my cousin.\"\n\n\"Yes;--ten times removed. But so much the better if he's to be\nanything more than a cousin.\"\n\n\"He is to be nothing more, Mrs. Askerton.\"\n\n\"You're quite sure of that?\"\n\n\"I am quite sure of it. And I cannot understand why there should be\nsuch a suspicion because he and I are thrown closely together, and\nare fond of each other. Whether he is a sixth, eighth, or tenth\ncousin makes no difference. He is the nearest I have on that side;\nand since my poor brother's death he is papa's heir. It is so natural\nthat he should be my friend;--and such a comfort that he should be\nsuch a friend as he is! I own it seems cruel to me that under such\ncircumstances there should be any suspicion.\"\n\n\"Suspicion, my dear;--suspicion of what?\"\n\n\"Not that I care for it. I am prepared to love him as if he\nwere my brother. I think him one of the finest creatures I ever\nknew,--perhaps the finest I ever did know. His energy and good-nature\ntogether are just the qualities to make the best kind of man. I am\nproud of him as my friend and my cousin, and now you may suspect what\nyou please.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, why should not he fall in love with you? It would be\nthe most proper, and also the most convenient thing in the world.\"\n\n\"I hate talking of falling in love;--as though a woman has nothing\nelse to think of whenever she sees a man.\"\n\n\"A woman has nothing else to think of.\"\n\n\"I have,--a great deal else. And so has he.\"\n\n\"It's quite out of the question on his part, then?\"\n\n\"Quite out of the question. I'm sure he likes me. I can see it in his\nface, and hear it in his voice, and am so happy that it is so. But it\nisn't in the way that you mean. Heaven knows that I may want a friend\nsome of these days, and I feel that I may trust to him. His feelings\nto me will be always those of a brother.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so. I have seen that fraternal love before under similar\ncircumstances, and it has always ended in the same way.\"\n\n\"I hope it won't end in any way between us.\"\n\n\"But the joke is that this suspicion, as you call it,--which makes\nyou so indignant,--is simply a suggestion that a thing should happen\nwhich, of all things in the world, would be the best for both of\nyou.\"\n\n\"But the thing won't happen, and therefore let there be an end of it.\nI hate the twaddle talk of love, whether it's about myself or about\nany one else. It makes me feel ashamed of my sex, when I find that\nI cannot talk of myself to another woman without being supposed to\nbe either in love or thinking of love,--either looking for it or\navoiding it. When it comes, if it comes prosperously, it's a very\ngood thing. But I for one can do without it, and I feel myself\ninjured when such a state of things is presumed to be impossible.\"\n\n\"It is worth any one's while to irritate you, because your\nindignation is so beautiful.\"\n\n\"It is not beautiful to me; for I always feel ashamed afterwards of\nmy own energy. And now, if you please, we won't say anything more\nabout Mr. Will Belton.\"\n\n\"May I not talk about him, even as the enterprising cousin?\"\n\n\"Certainly; and in any other light you please. Do you know he seemed\nto think that he had known you ever so many years ago.\" Clara, as\nshe said this, did not look direct at her friend's face; but still\nshe could perceive that Mrs. Askerton was disconcerted. There came a\nshade of paleness over her face, and a look of trouble on her brow,\nand for a moment or two she made no reply.\n\n\"Did he?\" she then said. \"And when was that?\"\n\n\"I suppose it was in London. But, after all, I believe it was not\nyou, but somebody whom he remembers to have been like you. He says\nthat the lady was a Miss Vigo.\" As she pronounced the name, Clara\nturned her face away, feeling instinctively that it would be kind to\ndo so.\n\n\"Miss Vigo!\" said Mrs. Askerton at once; and there was that in the\ntone of her voice which made Clara feel that all was not right with\nher. \"I remember that there were Miss Vigos; two of them, I think.\nI didn't know that they were like me especially.\"\n\n\"And he says that the one he remembers married a Mr. Berdmore.\"\n\n\"Married a Mr. Berdmore!\" The tone of voice was still the same, and\nthere was an evident struggle, as though the woman was making a\nvehement effort to speak in her natural voice. Then Clara looked at\nher, feeling that if she abstained from doing so, the very fact of\nher so abstaining would be remarkable. There was the look of pain on\nMrs. Askerton's brow, and her cheeks were still pale, but she smiled\nas she went on speaking. \"I'm sure I'm flattered, for I remember that\nthey were both considered beauties. Did he know anything more of\nher?\"\n\n\"No; nothing more.\"\n\n\"There must have been some casual likeness I suppose.\" Mrs. Askerton\nwas a clever woman, and had by this time almost recovered her\nself-possession. Then there came a ring at the front door, and in\nanother minute Mr. Belton was in the room. Mrs. Askerton felt that it\nwas imperative on her to make some allusion to the conversation which\nhad just taken place, and dashed at the subject at once. \"Clara tells\nme that I am exactly like some old friend of yours, Mr. Belton.\"\n\nThen he looked at her closely as he answered her. \"I have no right to\nsay that she was my friend, Mrs. Askerton,\" he said; \"indeed there\nwas hardly what might be called an acquaintance between us; but you\ncertainly are extremely like a certain Miss Vigo that I remember.\"\n\n\"I often wonder that one person isn't more often found to be like\nanother,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"People often are like,\" said he; \"but not like in such a way as to\ngive rise to mistakes as to identity. Now, I should have stopped you\nin the street and called you Mrs. Berdmore.\"\n\n\"Didn't I once see or hear the name of Berdmore in this house?\" asked\nClara.\n\nThen that look of pain returned. Mrs. Askerton had succeeded in\nrecovering the usual tone of her countenance, but now she was once\nmore disturbed. \"I think I know the name,\" said she.\n\n\"I fancy that I have seen it in this house,\" said Clara.\n\n\"You may more likely have heard it, my dear. My memory is very poor,\nbut if I remember rightly, Colonel Askerton did know a Captain\nBerdmore,--a long while ago, before he was married; and you may\nprobably have heard him mention the name.\" This did not quite satisfy\nClara, but she said nothing more about it then. If there was a\nmystery which Mrs. Askerton did not wish to have explored, why should\nshe explore it?\n\nSoon after this Clara got up to go, and Mrs. Askerton, making another\nattempt to be cheerful, was almost successful. \"So you're going back\ninto Norfolk on Saturday, Clara tells me. You are making a very short\nvisit now that you're come among us.\"\n\n\"It is a long time for me to be away from home. Farmers can hardly\never dare to leave their work. But in spite of my farm, I am talking\nof coming here again about Christmas.\"\n\n\"But you are going to have a farming establishment here too?\"\n\n\"That will be nothing. Clara will look after that for me; will you\nnot?\" Then they went, and Belton had to consider how he would begin\nthe work before him. He had some idea that too much precipitancy\nmight do him an injury, but he hardly knew how to commence without\ncoming to the point at once. When they were out together in the park,\nhe went back at first to the subject of Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"I would almost have sworn they were one and the same woman,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"But you see that they are not.\"\n\n\"It's not only the likeness, but the voice. It so chanced that I once\nsaw that Miss Vigo in some trouble. I happened to meet her in company\nwith a man who was,--who was tipsy, in fact, and I had to relieve\nher.\"\n\n\"Dear me,--how disagreeable!\"\n\n\"It's a long time ago, and there can't be any harm in mentioning it\nnow. It was the man she was going to marry, and whom she did marry.\"\n\n\"What;--the Mr. Berdmore?\"\n\n\"Yes; he was often in that way. And there was a look about Mrs.\nAskerton just now so like the look of that Miss Vigo then, that I\ncannot get rid of the idea.\"\n\n\"They can't be the same, as she was certainly a Miss Oliphant. And\nyou hear, too, what she says.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I heard what she said. You have known her long?\"\n\n\"These two years.\"\n\n\"And intimately?\"\n\n\"Very intimately. She is our only neighbour; and her being here has\ncertainly been a great comfort to me. It is sad not having some woman\nnear one that one can speak to;--and then, I really do like her very\nmuch.\"\n\n\"No doubt it's all right.\"\n\n\"Yes; it's all right,\" said Clara. After that there was nothing more\nsaid about Mrs. Askerton, and Belton began his work. They had gone\nfrom the cottage, across the park, away from the house, up to a high\nrock which stood boldly out of the ground, from whence could be seen\nthe sea on one side, and on the other a far tract of country almost\naway to the moors. And when they reached this spot they seated\nthemselves. \"There,\" said Clara, \"I consider this to be the prettiest\nspot in England.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen all England,\" said Belton.\n\n\"Don't be so matter-of-fact, Will. I say it's the prettiest in\nEngland, and you can't contradict me.\"\n\n\"And I say you're the prettiest girl in England, and you can't\ncontradict me.\"\n\nThis annoyed Clara, and almost made her feel that her paragon of a\ncousin was not quite so perfect as she had represented him to be. \"I\nsee,\" she said, \"that if I talk nonsense I'm to be punished.\"\n\n\"Is it a punishment to you to know that I think you very handsome?\"\nhe said, turning round and looking full into her face.\n\n\"It is disagreeable to me--very, to have any such subject talked\nabout at all. What would you think if I began to pay you foolish\npersonal compliments?\"\n\n\"What I say isn't foolish; and there's a great difference. Clara,\nI love you better than all the world put together.\"\n\nShe now looked at him; but still she did not believe it. It could\nnot be that after all her boastings she should have made so gross a\nblunder. \"I hope you do love me,\" she said; \"indeed, you are bound to\ndo so, for you promised that you would be my brother.\"\n\n\"But that will not satisfy me now, Clara. Clara, I want to be your\nhusband.\"\n\n\"Will!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Now you know it all; and if I have been too sudden, I must beg your\npardon.\"\n\n\"Oh, Will, forget that you have said this. Do not go on until\neverything must be over between us.\"\n\n\"Why should anything be over between us? Why should it be wrong in me\nto love you?\"\n\n\"What will papa say?\"\n\n\"Mr. Amedroz knows all about it already, and has given me his\nconsent. I asked him directly I had made up my own mind, and he told\nme that I might go to you.\"\n\n\"You have asked papa? Oh dear, oh dear, what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Am I so odious to you then?\" As he said this he got up from his seat\nand stood before her. He was a tall, well-built, handsome man, and he\ncould assume a look and mien that were almost noble when he was moved\nas he was moved now.\n\n\"Odious! Do you not know that I have loved you as my cousin--that\nI have already learned to trust you as though you were really my\nbrother? But this breaks it all.\"\n\n\"You cannot love me then as my wife?\"\n\n\"No.\" She pronounced the monosyllable alone, and then he walked away\nfrom her as though that one little word settled the question for him,\nnow and for ever. He walked away from her, perhaps a distance of two\nhundred yards, as though the interview was over, and he were leaving\nher. She, as she saw him go, wished that he would return that she\nmight say some word of comfort to him. Not that she could have said\nthe only word that would have comforted him. At the first blush of\nthe thing, at the first sound of the address which he had made to\nher, she had been angry with him. He had disappointed her, and she\nwas indignant. But her anger had already melted and turned itself to\nruth. She could not but love him better, in that he had loved her so\nwell; but yet she could not love him with the love which he desired.\n\nBut he did not leave her. When he had gone from her down the hill\nthe distance that has been named, he turned back, and came up to her\nslowly. He had a trick of standing and walking with his thumbs fixed\ninto the armholes of his waistcoat, while his large hands rested on\nhis breast. He would always assume this attitude when he was assured\nthat he was right in his views, and was eager to carry some point\nat issue. Clara already understood that this attitude signified his\nintention to be autocratic. He now came close up to her, and again\nstood over her, before he spoke. \"My dear,\" he said, \"I have been\nrough and hasty in what I have said to you, and I have to ask you to\npardon my want of manners.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"But in a matter of so much interest to us both you will not let an\nawkward manner prejudice me.\"\n\n\"It is not that; indeed, it is not.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, dearest. It is true that I promised to be your\nbrother, and I will not break my word unless I break it by your own\nsanction. I did promise to be your brother, but I did not know then\nhow fondly I should come to love you. Your father, when I told him of\nthis, bade me not to be hasty; but I am hasty, and I haven't known\nhow to wait. Tell me that I may come at Christmas for my answer,\nand I will not say a word to trouble you till then. I will be your\nbrother, at any rate till Christmas.\"\n\n\"Be my brother always.\"\n\nA black cloud crossed his brow as this request reached his ears.\nShe was looking anxiously into his face, watching every turn in\nthe expression of his countenance. \"Will you not let it wait till\nChristmas?\" he asked.\n\nShe thought it would be cruel to refuse this request, and yet she\nknew that no such waiting could be of service to him. He had been\nawkward in his love-making, and was aware of it. He should have\ncontrived this period of waiting for himself; giving her no option\nbut to wait and think of it. He should have made no proposal, but\nhave left her certain that such proposal was coming. In such case she\nmust have waited--and if good could have come to him from that, he\nmight have received it. But, as the question was now presented to\nher, it was impossible that she should consent to wait. To have given\nsuch consent would have been tantamount to receiving him as her\nlover. She was therefore forced to be cruel.\n\n\"It will be of no avail to postpone my answer when I know what it\nmust be. Why should there be suspense?\"\n\n\"You mean that it is impossible that you should love me?\"\n\n\"Not in that way, Will.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" Then there was a pause. \"But I am a fool to ask such a\nquestion as that, and I should be worse than a fool were I to press\nit. It must then be considered as settled?\"\n\nShe got up and clung to his arm. \"Oh, Will, do not look at me like\nthat!\"\n\n\"It must then be considered as settled?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Yes, Will, yes. Pray consider it as settled.\" He then sat down on\nthe rock again, and she came and sat by him,--near to him, but not\nclose as she had been before. She turned her eyes upon him, gazing on\nhim, but did not speak to him; and he sat also without speaking for a\nwhile, with his eyes fixed upon the ground. \"I suppose we may go back\nto the house?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Give me your hand, Will, and tell me that you will still love me--as\nyour sister.\"\n\nHe gave her his hand. \"If you ever want a brother's care you shall\nhave it from me,\" he said.\n\n\"But not a brother's love?\"\n\n\"No. How can the two go together? I shan't cease to love you because\nmy love is in vain. Instead of making me happy it will make me\nwretched. That will be the only difference.\"\n\n\"I would give my life to make you happy, if that were possible.\"\n\n\"You will not give me your life in the way that I would have it.\"\nAfter that they walked in silence back to the house, and when he had\nopened the front door for her, he parted from her and stood alone\nunder the porch, thinking of his misfortune.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nSAFE AGAINST LOVE-MAKING ONCE AGAIN.\n\n\nFor a considerable time Belton stood under the porch of the house,\nthinking of what had happened to him, and endeavouring to steady\nhimself under the blow which he had received. I do not know that he\nhad been sanguine of success. Probably he had made to himself no\nassurances on the subject. But he was a man to whom failure, of\nitself, was intolerable. In any other event of life he would have\ntold himself that he would not fail--that he would persevere and\nconquer. He could imagine no other position as to which he could at\nonce have been assured of failure, in any project on which he had set\nhis heart. But as to this project it was so. He had been told that\nshe could not love him--that she could never love him;--and he had\nbelieved her. He had made his attempt and had failed; and, as he\nthought of this, standing under the porch, he became convinced that\nlife for him was altogether changed, and that he who had been so\nhappy must now be a wretched man.\n\nHe was still standing there when Mr. Amedroz came down into the\nhall, dressed for dinner, and saw his figure through the open doors.\n\"Will,\" he said, coming up to him, \"it only wants five minutes to\ndinner.\" Belton started and shook himself, as though he were shaking\noff a lethargy, and declared that he was quite ready. Then he\nremembered that he would be expected to dress, and rushed up-stairs,\nthree steps at a time, to his own room. When he came down, Clara and\nher father were already in the dining-room, and he joined them there.\n\nMr. Amedroz, though he was not very quick in reading facts from the\nmanners of those with whom he lived, had felt assured that things had\ngone wrong between Belton and his daughter. He had not as yet had a\nminute in which to speak to Clara, but he was certain that it was so.\nIndeed, it was impossible not to read terrible disappointment and\ndeep grief in the young man's manner. He made no attempt to conceal\nit, though he did not speak of it. Through the whole evening, though\nhe was alone for a while with the squire, and alone also for a time\nwith Clara, he never mentioned or alluded to the subject of his\nrejection. But he bore himself as though he knew and they knew--as\nthough all the world knew that he had been rejected. And yet he did\nnot remain silent. He talked of his property and of his plans, and\nexplained how things were to be done in his absence. Once only was\nthere something like an allusion made to his sorrow. \"But you will be\nhere at Christmas?\" said Mr. Amedroz, in answer to something which\nBelton had said as to work to be done in his absence. \"I do not know\nhow that may be now,\" said Belton. And then they had all been silent.\n\nIt was a terrible evening to Clara. She endeavoured to talk, but\nfound it to be impossible. All the brightness of the last few days\nhad disappeared, and the world seemed to her to be more sad and\nsolemn than ever. She had no idea when she was refusing him that he\nwould have taken it to heart as he had done. The question had come\nbefore her for decision so suddenly, that she had not, in fact, had\ntime to think of this as she was making her answer. All she had done\nwas to feel that she could not be to him what he wished her to be.\nAnd even as yet she had hardly asked herself why she must be so\nsteadfast in her refusal. But she had refused him steadfastly, and\nshe did not for a moment think of reducing the earnestness of her\nresolution. It seemed to be manifest to her, from his present manner,\nthat he would never ask the question again; but she was sure, let it\nbe asked ever so often, that it could not be answered in any other\nway.\n\nMr. Amedroz, not knowing why it was so, became cross and querulous,\nand scolded his daughter. To Belton, also, he was captious, making\nlittle difficulties, and answering him with petulance. This the\nrejected lover took with most extreme patience, as though such a\ntrifling annoyance had no effect in adding anything to his misery. He\nstill held his purpose of going on the Saturday, and was still intent\non work which was to be done before he went; but it seemed that he\nwas satisfied to do everything now as a duty, and that the enjoyment\nof the thing, which had heretofore been so conspicuous, was over.\n\nAt last they separated, and Clara, as was her wont, went up to her\nfather's room. \"Papa,\" she said, \"what is all this about Mr. Belton?\"\n\n\"All what, my dear? what do you mean?\"\n\n\"He has asked me to be,--to be his wife; and has told me that he came\nwith your consent.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't he have my consent? What is there amiss with him?\nWhy shouldn't you marry him if he likes you? You seemed, I thought,\nto be very fond of him.\"\n\nThis surprised Clara more than anything. She could hardly have told\nherself why, but she would have thought that such a proposition\nfrom her cousin would have made her father angry,--unreasonably\nangry;--angry with him for presuming to have such an idea; but now it\nseemed that he was going to be angry with her for not accepting her\ncousin out of hand.\n\n\"Yes, papa; I am fond of him; but not like that. I did not expect\nthat he would think of me in that way.\"\n\n\"But why shouldn't he think of you? It would be a very good marriage\nfor you, as far as money is concerned.\"\n\n\"You would not have me marry any one for that reason;--would you,\npapa?\"\n\n\"But you seemed to like him. Well; of course I can't make you like\nhim. I meant to do for the best; and when he came to me as he did,\nI thought he was behaving very handsomely, and very much like a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"I am sure he would do that.\"\n\n\"And if I could have thought that this place would be your home when\nI am gone, it would have made me very happy;--very happy.\"\n\nShe now came and stood close to him and took his hand. \"I hope, papa,\nyou do not make yourself uneasy about me. I shall do very well. I'm\nsure you can't want me to go away and leave you.\"\n\n\"How will you do very well? I'm sure I don't know. And if your aunt\nWinterfield means to provide for you, it would only be kind in her\nto let me know it, so that I might not have the anxiety always on my\nmind.\"\n\nClara knew well enough what was to be the disposition of her aunt's\nproperty, but she could not tell her father of that now. She almost\nfelt that it was her duty to do so, but she could not bring herself\nto do it. She could only beg him not to be anxious on her behalf,\nmaking vague assurances that she would do very well. \"And you are\ndetermined not to change your mind about Will?\" he said at last.\n\n\"I shall not change my mind about that, papa, certainly,\" she\nanswered. Then he turned away from her, and she saw that he was\ndispleased.\n\nWhen alone, she was forced to ask herself why it was that she was so\ncertain. Alas! there could in truth be no doubt on that subject in\nher own mind. When she sat down, resolved to give herself an answer,\nthere was no doubt. She could not love her cousin, Will Belton,\nbecause her heart belonged to Captain Aylmer.\n\nBut she knew that she had received nothing in exchange for her heart.\nHe had been kind to her on that journey to Taunton, when the agony\narising from her brother's death had almost crushed her. He had\noften been kind to her on days before that,--so kind, so soft in\nhis manners, approaching so nearly to the little tendernesses of\nincipient love-making, that the idea of regarding him as her lover\nhad of necessity forced itself upon her. But in nothing had he gone\nbeyond those tendernesses, which need not imperatively be made\nto mean anything, though they do often mean so much. It was now\ntwo years since she had first thought that Captain Aylmer was\nthe most perfect gentleman she knew, and nearly two years since\nMrs. Winterfield had expressed to her a hope that Captain Aylmer\nmight become her husband. She had replied that such a thing was\nimpossible,--as any girl would have replied; and had in consequence\ntreated Captain Aylmer with all the coolness which she had been\nable to assume whenever she was in company with him in her aunt's\npresence. Nor was it natural to her to be specially gracious to a man\nunder such trying circumstances, even when no Mrs. Winterfield was\nthere to behold. And so things had gone on. Captain Aylmer had now\nand again made himself very pleasant to her,--at certain trying\nperiods of joy or trouble almost more than pleasant. But nothing had\ncome of it, and Clara had told herself that Captain Aylmer had no\nspecial feeling in her favour. She had told herself this, ever since\nthat journey together from Perivale to Taunton; but never till now\nhad she also confessed to herself what was her own case.\n\nShe made a comparison between the two men. Her cousin Will was, she\nthought, the more generous, the more energetic,--perhaps, by nature,\nthe man of the higher gifts. In person he was undoubtedly the\nsuperior. He was full of noble qualities;--forgetful of self,\nindustrious, full of resources, a very man of men, able to command,\neager in doing work for others' good and his own,--a man altogether\nuncontaminated by the coldness and selfishness of the outer world.\nBut he was rough, awkward, but indifferently educated, and with few\nof those tastes which to Clara Amedroz were delightful. He could\nnot read poetry to her, he could not tell her of what the world of\nliterature was doing now or of what it had done in times past. He\nknew nothing of the inner world of worlds which governs the world.\nShe doubted whether he could have told her who composed the existing\ncabinet, or have given the name of a single bishop beyond the see in\nwhich his own parish was situated. But Captain Aylmer knew everybody,\nand had read everything, and understood, as though by instinct, all\nthe movements of the world in which he lived.\n\nBut what mattered any such comparison? Even though she should be able\nto prove to herself beyond the shadow of a doubt that her cousin Will\nwas of the two the fitter to be loved,--the one more worthy of her\nheart,--no such proof could alter her position. Love does not go by\nworth. She did not love her cousin as she must love any man to whom\nshe could give her hand,--and, alas! she did love that other man.\n\nOn this night I doubt whether Belton did slumber with that solidity\nof repose which was usual to him. At any rate, before he came down in\nthe morning he had found time for sufficient thought, and had brought\nhimself to a resolution. He would not give up the battle as lost. To\nhis thinking there was something weak and almost mean in abandoning\nany project which he had set before himself. He had been awkward, and\nhe exaggerated to himself his own awkwardness. He had been hasty, and\nhad gone about his task with inconsiderate precipitancy. It might be\nthat he had thus destroyed all his chance of success. But, as he said\nto himself, \"he would never say die, as long as there was a puff of\nbreath left to him.\" He would not mope, and hang down his head, and\nwear the willow. Such a state of things would ill suit either the\nroughness or the readiness of his life. No! He would bear like a man\nthe disappointment which had on this occasion befallen him, and would\nreturn at Christmas and once more try his fortune.\n\nAt breakfast, therefore, the cloud had passed from his brow. When he\ncame in he found Clara alone in the room, and he simply shook hands\nwith her after his ordinary fashion. He said nothing of yesterday,\nand almost succeeded in looking as though yesterday had been in\nno wise memorable. She was not so much at her ease, but she also\nreceived some comfort from his demeanour. Mr. Amedroz came down\nalmost immediately, and Belton soon took an opportunity of saying\nthat he would be back at Christmas if Mr. Amedroz would receive him.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the squire. \"I thought it had been all settled.\"\n\n\"So it was;--till I said a word yesterday which foolishly seemed to\nunsettle it. But I have thought it over again, and I find that I can\nmanage it.\"\n\n\"We shall be so glad to have you!\" said Clara.\n\n\"And I shall be equally glad to come. They are already at work, sir,\nabout the sheds.\"\n\n\"Yes; I saw the carts full of bricks go by,\" said the squire,\nquerulously. \"I didn't know there was to be any brickwork. You said\nyou would have it made of deal slabs with oak posts.\"\n\n\"You must have a foundation, sir. I propose to carry the brickwork a\nfoot and a half above the ground.\"\n\n\"I suppose you know best. Only that kind of thing is so very ugly.\"\n\n\"If you find it to be ugly after it is done, it shall be pulled down\nagain.\"\n\n\"No;--it can never come down again.\"\n\n\"It can;--and it shall, if you don't like it. I never think anything\nof changes like that.\"\n\n\"I think they'll be very pretty!\" said Clara.\n\n\"I dare say,\" said the squire; \"but at any rate it won't make much\ndifference to me. I shan't be here long to see them.\"\n\nThis was rather melancholy; but Belton bore up even against this,\nspeaking cheery words and expressing bright hopes,--so that it\nseemed, both to Clara and to her father, that he had in a great\nmeasure overcome the disappointment of the preceding day. It was\nprobable that he was a man not prone to be deeply sensitive in such\nmatters for any long period. The period now had certainly not been\nlong, and yet Will Belton was alive again.\n\nImmediately after breakfast there occurred a little incident which\nwas not without its effect upon them all. There came up on the drive,\nimmediately before the front door, under the custody of a boy, a cow.\nIt was an Alderney cow, and any man or woman at all understanding\ncows, would at once have perceived that this cow was perfect in her\nkind. Her eyes were mild, and soft, and bright. Her legs were like\nthe legs of a deer; and in her whole gait and demeanour she almost\ngave the lie to her own name, asserting herself to have sprung from\nsome more noble origin among the woods, than may be supposed to\nbe the origin of the ordinary domestic cow,--a useful animal, but\nheavy in its appearance, and seen with more pleasure at some little\ndistance than at close quarters. But this cow was graceful in its\nmovements, and almost tempted one to regard her as the far-off\ndescendant of the elk or the antelope.\n\n\"What's that?\" said Mr. Amedroz, who, having no cows of his own, was\nnot pleased to see one brought up in that way before his hall door.\n\"There's somebody's cow come here.\"\n\nClara understood it in a moment; but she was pained, and said\nnothing. Had the cow come without any such scene as that of\nyesterday, she would have welcomed the animal with all cordiality,\nand would have sworn to her cousin that the cow should be cherished\nfor his sake. But after what had passed it was different. How was she\nto take any present from him now?\n\nBut Belton faced the difficulty without any bashfulness or apparent\nregret. \"I told you I would give you a cow,\" said he, \"and here she\nis.\"\n\n\"What can she want with a cow?\" said Mr. Amedroz.\n\n\"I am sure she wants one very much. At any rate she won't refuse the\npresent from me; will you, Clara?\"\n\nWhat could she say? \"Not if papa will allow me to keep it.\"\n\n\"But we've no place to put it!\" said the squire. \"We haven't got\ngrass for it!\"\n\n\"There's plenty of grass,\" said Belton. \"Come, Mr. Amedroz; I've made\na point of getting this little creature for Clara, and you mustn't\nstand in the way of my gratification.\" Of course he was successful,\nand of course Clara thanked him with tears in her eyes.\n\nThe next two days passed by without anything special to mark them,\nand then the cousin was to go. During the period of his visit he did\nnot see Colonel Askerton, nor did he again see Mrs. Askerton. He\nwent to the cottage once, with the special object of returning the\nColonel's call; but the master was out, and he was not specially\ninvited in to see the mistress. He said nothing more to Clara about\nher friends, but he thought of the matter more than once, as he\nwas going about the place, and became aware that he would like to\nascertain whether there was a mystery, and if so, what was its\nnature. He knew that he did not like Mrs. Askerton, and he felt\nalso that Mrs. Askerton did not like him. This was, as he thought,\nunfortunate; for might it not be the case, that in the one matter\nwhich was to him of so much importance, Mrs. Askerton might have\nconsiderable influence over Clara?\n\nDuring these days nothing special was said between him and Clara. The\nlast evening passed over without anything to brighten it or to make\nit memorable. Mr. Amedroz, in his passive, but gently querulous way,\nwas sorry that Belton was going to leave him, as his cousin had been\nthe creation of some new excitement for him, but he said nothing on\nthe subject; and when the time for going to bed had come, he bade his\nguest farewell with some languid allusion to the pleasure which he\nwould have in seeing him again at Christmas. Belton was to start very\nearly in the morning,--before six, and of course he was prepared to\ntake leave also of Clara. But she told him very gently, so gently\nthat her father did not hear it, that she would be up to give him a\ncup of coffee before he went.\n\n\"Oh no,\" he said.\n\n\"But I shall. I won't have you go without seeing you out of the\ndoor.\"\n\nAnd on the following morning she was up before him. She hardly\nunderstood, herself, why she was doing this. She knew that it should\nbe her object to avoid any further special conversation on that\nsubject which they had discussed up among the rocks. She knew that\nshe could give him no comfort, and that he could give none to her. It\nwould seem that he was willing to let the remembrance of the scene\npass away, so that it should be as though it had never been; and\nsurely it was not for her to disturb so salutary an arrangement!\nBut yet she was up to bid him Godspeed as he went. She could not\nbear,--so she excused the matter to herself,--she could not bear to\nthink that he should regard her as ungrateful. She knew all that he\nhad done for them. She had perceived that the taking of the land, the\nbuilding of the sheds, the life which he had contrived in so short a\ntime to throw into the old place, had all come from a desire on his\npart to do good to those in whose way he stood by family arrangements\nmade almost before his birth; and she longed to say to him one\nword of thanks. And had he not told her,--once in the heat of\nhis disappointment; for then at that moment, as Clara said to\nherself, she supposed that he must have been in some measure\ndisappointed,--had he not even then told her that when she wanted\na brother's care, a brother's care should be given to her by him?\nWas she not therefore bound to do for him what she would do for a\nbrother?\n\nShe, with her own hands, brought the coffee into the little breakfast\nparlour, and handed the cup into his hands. The gig, which had come\novernight from Taunton, was not yet at the door, and there was a\nminute or two during which they must speak to each other. Who has not\nseen some such girl when she has come down early, without the full\ncompleteness of her morning toilet, and yet nicer, fresher, prettier\nto the eye of him who is so favoured, than she has ever been in more\nformal attire? And what man who has been so favoured has not loved\nher who has so favoured him, even though he may not previously have\nbeen enamoured as deeply as poor Will Belton?\n\n\"This is so good of you,\" he said.\n\n\"I wish I knew how to be good to you,\" she answered,--not meaning to\ntrench upon dangerous ground, but feeling, as the words came from\nher, that she had done so. \"You have been so good to us, so very good\nto papa, that we owe you everything. I am so grateful to you for\nsaying that you will come back at Christmas.\"\n\nHe had resolved that he would refrain from further love-making till\nthe winter; but he found it very hard to refrain when so addressed.\nTo take her in his arms, and kiss her twenty times, and swear that he\nwould never let her go,--to claim her at once savagely as his own,\nthat was the line of conduct to which temptation prompted him. How\ncould she look at him so sweetly, how could she stand before him,\nministering to him with all her pretty maidenly charms brought so\nclose to him, without intending that he should love her? But he did\nrefrain. \"Blood is thicker than water,\" said he. \"That's the real\nreason why I first came.\"\n\n\"I understand that quite, and it is that feeling that makes you so\ngood. But I'm afraid you are spending a great deal of money here--and\nall for our sakes.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I shall get my money back again. And if I didn't, what\nthen? I've plenty of money. It is not money that I want.\"\n\nShe could not ask him what it was that he did want, and she was\nobliged therefore to begin again. \"Papa will look forward so to the\nwinter now.\"\n\n\"And so shall I.\"\n\n\"But you must come for longer then;--you won't go away at the end of\na week? Say that you won't.\"\n\n\"I'll see about it. I can't tell quite yet. You'll write me a line to\nsay when the shed is finished, won't you?\"\n\n\"That I will, and I'll tell you how Bessy goes on.\" Bessy was the\ncow. \"I will be so very fond of her. She'll come to me for apples\nalready.\"\n\nBelton thought that he would go to her, wherever she might be, even\nif he were to get no apples. \"It's all cupboard love with them,\" he\nsaid. \"I'll tell you what I'll do;--when I come, I'll bring you a dog\nthat will follow you without thinking of apples.\" Then the gig was\nheard on the gravel before the door, and Belton was forced to go. For\na moment he reflected whether, as her cousin, it was not his duty to\nkiss her. It was a matter as to which he had doubt,--as is the case\nwith many male cousins; but ultimately he resolved that if he kissed\nher at all he would not kiss her in that light, and so he again\nrefrained. \"Good-bye,\" he said, putting out his great hand to her.\n\n\"Good-bye, Will, and God bless you.\" I almost think he might have\nkissed her, asking himself no questions as to the light in which it\nwas done.\n\nAs he turned from her he saw the tears in her eyes; and as he sat in\nthe gig, thinking of them, other tears came into his own. By heaven,\nhe would have her yet! He was a man who had not read much of romance.\nTo him all the imagined mysteries of passion had not been made common\nby the perusal of legions of love stories;--but still he knew enough\nof the game to be aware that women had been won in spite, as it were,\nof their own teeth. He knew that he could not now run away with her,\ntaking her off by force; but still he might conquer her will by his\nown. As he remembered the tears in her eyes, and the tone of her\nvoice, and the pressure of her hand, and the gratitude that had\nbecome tender in its expression, he could not but think that he would\nbe wise to love her still. Wise or foolish, he did love her still;\nand it should not be owing to fault of his if she did not become his\nwife. As he drove along he saw little of the Quantock hills, little\nof the rich Somersetshire pastures, little of the early beauty of the\nAugust morning. He saw nothing but her eyes, moistened with bright\ntears, and before he reached Taunton he had rebuked himself with many\nrevilings in that he had parted from her and not kissed her.\n\nClara stood at the door watching the gig till it was out of\nsight,--watching it as well as her tears would allow. What a grand\ncousin he was! Had it not been a pity,--a thousand pities,--that\nthat grievous episode should have come to mar the brotherly love,\nthe sisterly confidence, which might otherwise have been so perfect\nbetween them? But perhaps it might all be well yet. Clara knew,\nor thought that she knew, that men and women differed in their\nappreciation of love. She, having once loved, could not change. Of\nthat she was sure. Her love might be fortunate or unfortunate. It\nmight be returned, or it might simply be her own, to destroy all\nhope of happiness for her on earth. But whether it were this or that,\nwhether productive of good or evil, the love itself could not be\nchanged. But with men she thought it might be different. Her cousin,\ndoubtless, had been sincere in the full sincerity of his heart when\nhe made his offer. And had she accepted it,--had she been able to\naccept it,--she believed that he would have loved her truly and\nconstantly. Such was his nature. But she also believed that love with\nhim, unrequited love, would have no enduring effect, and that he\nhad already resolved, with equal courage and wisdom, to tread this\nshort-lived passion out beneath his feet. One night had sufficed\nto him for that treading out. As she thought of this the tears ran\nplentifully down her cheek; and going again to her room she remained\nthere crying till it was time for her to wipe away the marks of her\nweeping, that she might go to her father.\n\nBut she was very glad that Will bore it so well;--very glad! Her\ncousin was safe against love-making once again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nMISS AMEDROZ GOES TO PERIVALE.\n\n\nIt had been settled for some time past that Miss Amedroz was to go\nto Perivale for a few days in November. Indeed it seemed to be a\nrecognised fact in her life that she was to make the journey from\nBelton to Perivale and back very often, as there prevailed an idea\nthat she owed a divided duty. This was in some degree hard upon her,\nas she had very little gratification in these visits to her aunt. Had\nthere been any intention on the part of Mrs. Winterfield to provide\nfor her, the thing would have been intelligible according to the\nusual arrangements which are made in the world on such matters; but\nMrs. Winterfield had scarcely a right to call upon her niece for\ndutiful attendance after having settled it with her own conscience\nthat her property was all to go to her nephew. But Clara entertained\nno thought of rebelling, and had agreed to make the accustomed\njourney in November, travelling then, as she did on all such\njourneys, at her aunt's expense.\n\nTwo things only occurred to disturb her tranquillity before she went,\nand they were not of much violence. Mr. Wright, the clergyman, called\nat Belton Castle, and in the course of conversation with Mr. Amedroz\nrenewed one of those ill-natured rumours which had before been spread\nabout Mrs. Askerton. Clara did not see him, but she heard an account\nof it all from her father.\n\n\"Does it mean, papa,\" she said, speaking almost with anger, \"that you\nwant me to give up Mrs. Askerton?\"\n\n\"How can you be so unkind as to ask me such a question?\" he replied.\n\"You know how I hate to be bothered. I tell you what I hear, and then\nyou can decide for yourself.\"\n\n\"But that isn't quite fair either, papa. That man comes here--\"\n\n\"That man, as you call him, is the rector of the parish, and I've\nknown him for forty years.\"\n\n\"And have never liked him, papa.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about liking anybody, my dear. Nobody likes me,\nand so why should I trouble myself?\"\n\n\"But, papa, it all amounts to this--that somebody has said that the\nAskertons are not Askertons at all, but ought to be called something\nelse. Now we know that he served as Captain and Major Askerton for\nseven years in India--and in fact it all means nothing. If I know\nanything, I know that he is Colonel Askerton.\"\n\n\"But do you know that she is his wife? That is what Mr. Wright asks.\nI don't say anything. I think it's very indelicate talking about such\nthings.\"\n\n\"If I am asked whether I have seen her marriage certificate,\ncertainly I have not; nor probably did you ever do so as to any lady\nthat you ever knew. But I know that she is her husband's wife, as we\nall of us know things of that sort. I know she was in India with him.\nI've seen things of hers marked with her name that she has had at\nleast for ten years.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, my dear,\" said Mr. Amedroz, angrily.\n\n\"But Mr. Wright ought to know something about it before he says such\nthings. And then this that he's saying now isn't the same that he\nsaid before.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he said before.\"\n\n\"He said they were both of them using a feigned name.\"\n\n\"It's nothing to me what name they use. I know I wish they hadn't\ncome here, if I'm to be troubled about them in this way--first by\nWright and then by you.\"\n\n\"They have been very good tenants, papa.\"\n\n\"You needn't tell me that, Clara, and remind me about the shooting\nwhen you know how unhappy it makes me.\"\n\nAfter this Clara said nothing more, and simply determined that Mr.\nWright and his gossip should have no effect upon her intimacy with\nMrs. Askerton. But not the less did she continue to remember what her\ncousin had said about Miss Vigo.\n\nAnd she had been ruffled a second time by certain observations which\nMrs. Askerton made to her respecting her cousin--or rather by little\nwords which were dropped on various occasions. It was very clear\nthat Mrs. Askerton did not like Mr. Belton, and that she wished to\nprejudice Clara against him. \"It's a pity he shouldn't be a lover\nof yours,\" the lady said, \"because it would be such a fine instance\nof Beauty and the Beast.\" It will of course be understood that Mrs.\nAskerton had never been told of the offer that had been made.\n\n\"You don't mean to say that he's not a handsome man,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I never observe whether a man is handsome or not; but I can see very\nwell whether he knows what to do with his arms and legs, or whether\nhe has the proper use of his voice before ladies.\" Clara remembered a\nword or two spoken by her cousin to herself, in speaking which he had\nseemed to have a very proper use of his voice. \"I know when a man is\nat ease like a gentleman, and when he is awkward like a--\"\n\n\"Like a what?\" said Clara. \"Finish what you've got to say.\"\n\n\"Like a ploughboy, I was going to say,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"I declare I think you have a spite against him, because he said you\nwere like some Miss Vigo,\" replied Clara, sharply. Mrs. Askerton was\non that occasion silenced, and she said nothing more about Mr. Belton\ntill after Clara had returned from Perivale.\n\nThe journey itself from Belton to Perivale was always a nuisance, and\nwas more so now than usual, as it was made in the disagreeable month\nof November. There was kept at the little inn at Redicote an old\nfly--so called--which habitually made the journey to the Taunton\nrailway-station, under the conduct of an old grey horse and an\nolder and greyer driver, whenever any of the old ladies of the\nneighbourhood were minded to leave their homes. This vehicle usually\ntravelled at the rate of five miles an hour; but the old grey driver\nwas never content to have time allowed to him for the transit\ncalculated upon such a rate of speed. Accidents might happen, and why\nshould he be made, as he would plaintively ask, to drive the poor\nbeast out of its skin? He was consequently always at Belton a full\nhour before the time, and though Clara was well aware of all this,\nshe could not help herself. Her father was fussy and impatient, the\nman was fussy and impatient; and there was nothing for her but to go.\nOn the present occasion she was taken off in this way the full sixty\nminutes too soon, and after four dreary hours spent upon the road,\nfound herself landed at the Taunton station, with a terrible gulf of\ntime to be passed before she could again proceed on her journey.\n\nOne little accident had occurred to her. The old horse, while\ntrotting leisurely along the level high road, had contrived to tumble\ndown. Clara did not think very much of this, as the same thing had\nhappened with her before; but, even with an hour or more to spare,\nthere arises a question whether under such circumstances the train\ncan be saved. But the grey old man reassured her. \"Now, miss,\" said\nhe, coming to the window, while he left his horse recumbent and\napparently comfortable on the road, \"where'd you have been now, zure,\nif I hadn't a few minutes in hand for you?\" Then he walked off to\nsome neighbouring cottage, and having obtained assistance, succeeded\nin putting his beast again upon his legs. After that he looked once\nmore in at the window. \"Who's right now, I wonder?\" he said, with an\nair of triumph. And when he came to her for his guerdon at Taunton,\nhe was evidently cross in not having it increased because of the\naccident.\n\nThat hour at the Taunton station was terrible to her. I know of no\nhours more terrible than those so passed. The minutes will not go\naway, and utterly fail in making good their claim to be called\nwinged. A man walks up and down the platform, and in that way obtains\nsomething of the advantage of exercise; but a woman finds herself\nbound to sit still within the dreary dulness of the waiting-room.\nThere are, perhaps, people who under such circumstances can read, but\nthey are few in number. The mind altogether declines to be active,\nwhereas the body is seized by a spirit of restlessness to which delay\nand tranquillity are loathsome. The advertisements on the walls are\nexamined, the map of some new Eden is studied--some Eden in which\nan irregular pond and a church are surrounded by a multiplicity\nof regular villas and shrubs--till the student feels that no\nconsideration of health or economy would induce him to live there.\nThen the porters come in and out, till each porter has made himself\nodious to the sight. Everything is hideous, dirty, and disagreeable;\nand the mind wanders away, to consider why station-masters do not\nmore frequently commit suicide. Clara Amedroz had already got beyond\nthis stage, and was beginning to think of herself rather than of the\nstation-master, when at last there sounded, close to her ears, the\nbell of promise, and she knew that the train was at hand.\n\nAt Taunton there branched away from the main line that line which\nwas to take her to Perivale, and therefore she was able to take her\nown place quietly in the carriage when she found that the down-train\nfrom London was at hand. This she did, and could then watch with\nequanimity, while the travellers from the other train went through\nthe penance of changing their seats. But she had not been so watching\nfor many seconds when she saw Captain Frederic Aylmer appear upon the\nplatform. Immediately she sank back into her corner and watched no\nmore. Of course he was going to Perivale; but why had not her aunt\ntold her that she was to meet him? Of course she would be staying in\nthe same house with him, and her present small attempt to avoid him\nwould thus be futile. The attempt was made; but nevertheless she was\nprobably pleased when she found that it was made in vain. He came at\nonce to the carriage in which she was sitting, and had packed his\ncoats, and dressing-bag, and desk about the carriage before he had\ndiscovered who was his fellow-traveller. \"How do you do, Captain\nAylmer?\" she said, as he was about to take his seat.\n\n\"Miss Amedroz! Dear me; how very odd! I had not the slightest\nexpectation of meeting you here. The pleasure is of course the\ngreater.\"\n\n\"Nor I of seeing you. Mrs. Winterfield has not mentioned to me that\nyou were coming to Perivale.\"\n\n\"I didn't know it myself till the day before yesterday. I'm going to\ngive an account of my stewardship to the good-natured Perivalians who\nsend me to Parliament. I'm to dine with the mayor to-morrow, and as\nsome big-wig has come in his way who is going to dine with him also,\nthe thing has been got up in a hurry. But I'm delighted to find that\nyou are to be with us.\"\n\n\"I generally go to my aunt about this time of the year.\"\n\n\"It is very good-natured of you.\" Then he asked after her father,\nand she told him of Mr. Belton's visit, telling him nothing--as the\nreader will hardly require to be told--of Mr. Belton's offer. And so,\nby degrees, they fell into close and intimate conversation.\n\n\"I am so glad, for your father's sake!\" said the captain, with\nsympathetic voice, speaking still of Mr. Belton's visit.\n\n\"That's what I feel, of course.\"\n\n\"It is just as it should be, as he stands in that position to the\nproperty. And so he is a nice sort of fellow, is he?\"\n\n\"Nice is no word for him. He is perfect!\"\n\n\"Dear me! This is terrible! You remember that they hated some old\nGreek patriot when they could find no fault in him?\"\n\n\"I'll defy you to hate my cousin Will.\"\n\n\"What sort of looking man is he?\"\n\n\"Extremely handsome;--at least I should say so.\"\n\n\"Then I certainly must hate him. And clever?\"\n\n\"Well;--not what you would call clever. He is very clever about\nfields and cattle.\"\n\n\"Come, there is some relief in that.\"\n\n\"But you must not mistake me. He is clever; and then there's a\nway about him of doing everything just as he likes it, which is\nwonderful. You feel quite sure that he'll become master of\neverything.\"\n\n\"But I do not feel at all sure that I should like him the better for\nthat!\"\n\n\"But he doesn't meddle in things that he doesn't understand. And then\nhe is so generous! His spending all that money down there is only\ndone because he thinks it will make the place pleasanter to papa.\"\n\n\"Has he got plenty of money?\"\n\n\"Oh, plenty! At least, I think so. He says that he has.\"\n\n\"The idea of any man owning that he had got plenty of money! What\na happy mortal! And then to be handsome, and omnipotent, and to\nunderstand cattle and fields! One would strive to emulate him rather\nthan envy him, had not one learned to acknowledge that it is not\ngiven to every one to get to Corinth.\"\n\n\"You may laugh at him, but you'd like him if you knew him.\"\n\n\"One never can be sure of that from a lady's account of a man. When\na man talks to me about another man, I can generally tell whether I\nshould like him or not--particularly if I know the man well who is\ngiving the description; but it is quite different when a woman is the\ndescriber.\"\n\n\"You mean that you won't take my word?\"\n\n\"We see with different eyes in such matters. I have no doubt your\ncousin is a worthy man--and as prosperous a gentleman as the Thane\nof Cawdor in his prosperous days;--but probably if he and I came\ntogether we shouldn't have a word to say to each other.\"\n\nClara almost hated Captain Aylmer for speaking as he did, and yet she\nknew that it was true. Will Belton was not an educated man, and were\nthey two to meet in her presence,--the captain and the farmer,--she\nfelt that she might have to blush for her cousin. But yet he was the\nbetter man of the two. She knew that he was the better man of the\ntwo, though she knew also that she could not love him as she loved\nthe other.\n\nThen they changed the subject of their conversation, and discussed\nMrs. Winterfield, as they had often done before. Captain Aylmer had\nsaid that he should return to London on the Saturday, the present day\nbeing Tuesday, and Clara accused him of escaping always from the real\nhard work of his position. \"I observe that you never stay a Sunday at\nPerivale,\" she said.\n\n\"Well;--not often. Why should I? Sunday is just the day that people\nlike to be at home.\"\n\n\"I should have thought it would not have made much difference to a\nbachelor in that way.\"\n\n\"But Sunday is a day that one specially likes to pass after one's own\nfashion.\"\n\n\"Exactly;--and therefore you don't stay with my aunt. I understand it\nall completely.\"\n\n\"Now you mean to be ill-natured!\"\n\n\"I mean to say that I don't like Sundays at Perivale at all, and that\nI should do just as you do if I had the power. But women,--women,\nthat is, of my age,--are such slaves! We are forced to give an\nobedience for which we can see no cause, and for which we can\nunderstand no necessity. I couldn't tell my aunt that I meant to go\naway on Saturday.\"\n\n\"You have no business which makes imperative calls upon your time.\"\n\n\"That means that I can't plead pretended excuses. But the true reason\nis that we are dependent.\"\n\n\"There is something in that, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Not that I am dependent on her. But my position generally is\ndependent, and I cannot assist myself.\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer found it difficult to make any answer to this, feeling\nthe subject to be one which could hardly be discussed between him and\nMiss Amedroz. He not unnaturally looked to be the heir of his aunt's\nproperty, and any provision made out of that property for Clara,\nwould so far lessen that which would come to him. For anything that\nhe knew, Mrs. Winterfield might leave everything she possessed to\nher niece. The old lady had not been open and candid to him whom she\nmeant to favour in her will, as she had been to her to whom no such\nfavour was to be shown. But Captain Aylmer did know, with tolerable\naccuracy, what was the state of affairs at Belton, and was aware\nthat Miss Amedroz had no prospect of maintenance on which to depend,\nunless she could depend on her aunt. She was now pleading that she\nwas not dependent on that lady, and Captain Aylmer felt that she was\nwrong. He was a man of the world, and was by no means inclined to\nabandon any right that was his own; but it seemed to him that he\nwas almost bound to say some word to show that in his opinion Clara\nshould hold herself bound to comply with her aunt's requirements.\n\n\"Dependence is a disagreeable word,\" he said; \"and one never quite\nknows what it means.\"\n\n\"If you were a woman you'd know. It means that I must stay at\nPerivale on Sundays, while you can go up to London or down to\nYorkshire. That's what it means.\"\n\n\"What you do mean, I think, is this;--that you owe a duty to\nyour aunt, the performance of which is not altogether agreeable.\nNevertheless it would be foolish in you to omit it.\"\n\n\"It isn't that;--not that at all. It would not be foolish, not in\nyour sense of the word, but it would be wrong. My aunt has been kind\nto me, and therefore I am bound to her for this service. But she is\nkind to you also, and yet you are not bound. That's why I complain.\nYou sail away under false pretences, and yet you think you do your\nduty. You have to see your lawyer,--which means going to your club;\nor to attend to your tenants,--which means hunting and shooting.\"\n\n\"I haven't got any tenants.\"\n\n\"You know very well that you could remain over Sunday without doing\nany harm to anybody;--only you don't like going to church three\ntimes, and you don't like hearing my aunt read a sermon afterwards.\nWhy shouldn't you stay, and I go to the club?\"\n\n\"With all my heart, if you can manage it.\"\n\n\"But I can't; we ain't allowed to have clubs, or shooting, or to\nhave our own way in anything, putting forward little pretences about\nlawyers.\"\n\n\"Come, I'll stay if you'll ask me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I won't do that. In the first place you'd go to sleep, and\nthen she would be offended; and I don't know that your sufferings\nwould make mine any lighter. I'm not prepared to alter the ways of\nthe world, but I feel myself entitled to grumble at them sometimes.\"\n\nMrs. Winterfield inhabited a large brick house in the centre of the\ntown. It had a long frontage to the street; for there was not only\nthe house itself, with its three square windows on each side of the\ndoor, and its seven windows over that, and again its seven windows in\nthe upper story,--but the end of the coach-house also abutted on the\nstreet, on which was the family clock, quite as much respected in\nPerivale as was the town-clock; and between the coach-house and the\nmansion there was the broad entrance into the yard, and the entrance\nalso to the back door. No Perivalian ever presumed to doubt that Mrs.\nWinterfield's house was the most important house in the town. Nor\ndid any stranger doubt it on looking at the frontage. But then it\nwas in all respects a town house to the eye,--that is, an English\ntown house, being as ugly and as respectable as unlimited bricks and\nmortar could make it. Immediately opposite to Mrs. Winterfield lived\nthe leading doctor and a retired builder, so that the lady's eye was\nnot hurt by any sign of a shop. The shops, indeed, came within a very\nfew yards of her on either side; but as the neighbouring shops on\neach side were her own property, this was not unbearable. To me, had\nI lived there, the incipient growth of grass through some of the\nstones which formed the margin of the road would have been altogether\nunendurable. There is no sign of coming decay which is so melancholy\nto the eye as any which tells of a decrease in the throng of men. Of\nmen or horses there was never any throng now in that end of Perivale.\nThat street had formed part of the main line of road from Salisbury\nto Taunton, and coaches, waggons, and posting-carriages had been\nfrequent on it; but now, alas! it was deserted. Even the omnibuses\nfrom the railway-station never came there unless they were ordered to\ncall at Mrs. Winterfield's door. For Mrs. Winterfield herself, this\ndesolation had, I think, a certain melancholy attraction. It suited\nher tone of mind and her religious views that she should be thus\ndaily reminded that things of this world were passing away and going\nto destruction. She liked to have ocular proof that grass was growing\nin the highways under mortal feet, and that it was no longer worth\nman's while to renew human flags in human streets. She was drawing\nnear to the pavements which would ever be trodden by myriads of\nbright sandals, and which yet would never be worn, and would be\ncarried to those jewelled causeways on which no weed could find a\nspot for its useless growth.\n\nBehind the house there was a square prim garden, arranged in\nparallelograms, tree answering to tree at every corner, round which\nit was still her delight to creep when the weather permitted. Poor\nClara! how much advice she had received during these creepings, and\nhow often had she listened to inquiries as to the schooling of the\ngardener's children. Mrs. Winterfield was always unhappy about her\ngardener. Serious footmen are very plentiful, and even coachmen are\nto be found who, at a certain rate of extra payment, will be punctual\nat prayer time, and will promise to read good little books; but\ngardeners, as a class, are a profane people, who think themselves\nentitled to claim liberty of conscience, and who will not submit to\nthe domestic despotism of a serious Sunday. They live in cottages\nby themselves, and choose to have an opinion of their own on church\nmatters. Mrs. Winterfield was aware that she ought to bid high for\nsuch a gardener as she wanted. A man must be paid well who will\nsubmit to daily inquiries as to the spiritual welfare of himself, his\nwife, and family. But even though she did bid high, and though she\npaid generously, no gardener would stop with her. One conscientious\nman attempted to bargain for freedom from religion during the six\nunimportant days of the week, being strong, and willing therefore to\ngive up his day of rest; but such liberty could not be allowed to\nhim, and he also went. \"He couldn't stop,\" he said, \"in justice to\nthe greenhouses, when missus was so constant down upon him about his\nsprittual backsliding. And, after all, where did he backslide? It was\nonly a pipe of tobacco with the babby in his arms, instead of that\ndarned evening lecture.\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Winterfield! She had been strong in her youth, and had\nherself sat through evening lectures with a fortitude which other\npeople cannot attain. And she was strong too in her age, with the\nstrength of a martyr, submitting herself with patience to wearinesses\nwhich are insupportable to those who have none of the martyr spirit.\nThe sermons of Perivale were neither bright, nor eloquent, nor\nencouraging. All the old vicar or the young curate could tell she had\nheard hundreds of times. She knew it all by heart, and could have\npreached their sermons to them better than they could preach them to\nher. It was impossible that she could learn anything from them; and\nyet she would sit there thrice a day, suffering from cold in winter,\nfrom cough in spring, from heat in summer, and from rheumatism in\nautumn; and now that her doctor had forbidden her to go more than\ntwice, recommending her to go only once, she really thought that she\nregarded the prohibition as a grievance. Indeed, to such as her, that\nexpectation of the jewelled causeway, and of the perfect pavement\nthat shall never be worn, must be everything. But if she was\nright,--right as to herself and others,--then why has the world been\nmade so pleasant? Why is the fruit of the earth so sweet; and the\ntrees,--why are they so green; and the mountains so full of glory?\nWhy are women so lovely? and why is it that the activity of man's\nmind is the only sure forerunner of man's progress? In listening\nthrice a day to outpourings from the clergymen at Perivale, there\ncertainly was no activity of mind.\n\nNow, in these days, Mrs. Winterfield was near to her reward. That she\nhad ensured that I cannot doubt. She had fed the poor, and filled the\nyoung full with religious teachings,--perhaps not wisely, and in her\nown way only too well, but yet as her judgment had directed her. She\nhad cared little for herself,--forgiving injuries done to her, and\nnot forgiving those only which she thought were done to the Lord. She\nhad lived her life somewhat as the martyr lived, who stood for years\non his pillar unmoved, while his nails grew through his flesh. So had\nshe stood, doing, I fear, but little positive good with her large\nmeans,--but thinking nothing of her own comfort here, in comparison\nwith the comfort of herself and others in the world to which she was\ngoing.\n\nOn this occasion her nephew and niece reached her together; the prim\nboy, with the white cotton gloves and the low four-wheeled carriage,\nhaving been sent down to meet Clara. For Mrs. Winterfield was a lady\nwho thought it unbecoming that her niece,--though only an adopted\nniece,--should come to her door in an omnibus. Captain Aylmer had\ndriven the four-wheeled carriage from the station, dispossessing the\nboy, and the luggage had been confided to the public conveyance.\n\n\"It is very fortunate that you should come together,\" said Mrs.\nWinterfield. \"I didn't know when to expect you, Fred. Indeed, you\nnever say at what hour you'll come.\"\n\n\"I think it safer to allow myself a little margin, aunt, because one\nhas so many things to do.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is so with a gentleman,\" said Mrs. Winterfield. After\nwhich Clara looked at Captain Aylmer, but did not betray any of her\nsuspicions. \"But I knew Clara would come by this train,\" continued\nthe old lady; \"so I sent Tom to meet her. Ladies always can be\npunctual; they can do that at any rate.\" Mrs. Winterfield was one of\nthose women who have always believed that their own sex is in every\nrespect inferior to the other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nCAPTAIN AYLMER MEETS HIS CONSTITUENTS.\n\n\nOn the first evening of their visit Captain Aylmer was very attentive\nto his aunt. He was quite alive to the propriety of such attentions,\nand to their expediency; and Clara was amused as she watched him\nwhile he sat by her side, by the hour together, answering little\nquestions and making little remarks suited to the temperament of the\nold lady's mind. She, herself, was hardly called upon to join in the\nconversation on that evening, and as she sat and listened, she could\nnot but think that Will Belton would have been less adroit, but that\nhe would also have been more straightforward. And yet why should\nnot Captain Aylmer talk to his aunt? Will Belton would also have\ntalked to his aunt if he had one, but then he would have talked his\nown talk, and not his aunt's talk. Clara could hardly make up her\nmind whether Captain Aylmer was or was not a sincere man. On the\nfollowing day Aylmer was out all the morning, paying visits among his\nconstituents, and at three o'clock he was to make his speech in the\nTown-hall. Special places in the gallery were to be kept for Mrs.\nWinterfield and her niece, and the old woman was quite resolved that\nshe would be there. As the day advanced she became very fidgety, and\nat length she was quite alive to the perils of having to climb up the\nTown-hall stairs; but she persevered, and at ten minutes before three\nshe was seated in her place.\n\n\"I suppose they will begin with prayer,\" she said to Clara. Clara,\nwho knew nothing of the manner in which things were done at such\nmeetings, said that she supposed so. A town councillor's wife who\nsat on the other side of Mrs. Winterfield, here took the liberty of\nexplaining that as the Captain was going to talk politics there would\nbe no prayers. \"But they have prayers in the Houses of Parliament,\"\nsaid Mrs. Winterfield, with much anger. To this the town councillor's\nwife, who was almost silenced by the great lady's wrath, said that\nindeed she did not know. After this Mrs. Winterfield continued to\nhope for the best, till the platform was filled and the proceedings\nhad commenced. Then she declared the present men of Perivale to be\na godless set, and expressed herself very sorry that her nephew had\never had anything to do with them. \"No good can come of it, my dear,\"\nshe said. Clara from the beginning had feared that no good would come\nof her aunt's visit to the Town-hall.\n\nThe business was put on foot at once, and with some little\nflourishing at the commencement, Captain Aylmer made his speech;--the\nsame speech which we have all heard and read so often, specially\nadapted to the meridian of Perivale. He was a Conservative, and of\ncourse he told his hearers that a good time was coming; that he and\nhis family were really about to buckle themselves to the work, and\nthat Perivale would hear things that would surprise it. The malt tax\nwas to go, and the farmers were to have free trade in beer,--the\narguments from the other side having come beautifully round in their\nappointed circle,--and old England was to be old England once again.\nHe did the thing tolerably well, as such gentlemen usually do, and\nPerivale was contented with its member, with the exception of one\nPerivalian. To Mrs. Winterfield, sitting up there and listening with\nall her ears, it seemed that he had hitherto omitted all allusion to\nany subject that was worthy of mention. At last he said some word\nabout the marriage and divorce court, condemning the iniquity of\nthe present law, to which Perivale had opposed itself violently by\npetition and general meetings; and upon hearing this Mrs. Winterfield\nhad thumped with her umbrella, and faintly cheered him with her weak\nold voice. But the surrounding Perivalians had heard the cheer, and\nit was repeated backwards and forwards through the room, till the\nmember's aunt thought that it might be her nephew's mission to annul\nthat godless Act of Parliament, and restore the matrimonial bonds of\nEngland to their old rigidity. When Captain Aylmer came out to hand\nher up to her little carriage, she patted him, and thanked him, and\nencouraged him; and on her way home she congratulated herself to\nClara that she should have such a nephew to leave behind her in her\nplace.\n\nCaptain Aylmer was dining with the mayor on that evening, and Mrs.\nWinterfield was therefore able to indulge herself in talking about\nhim. \"I don't see much of young men, of course,\" she said; \"but I do\nnot even hear of any that are like him.\" Again Clara thought of her\ncousin Will. Will was not at all like Frederic Aylmer; but was he not\nbetter? And yet, as she thought thus, she remembered that she had\nrefused her cousin Will because she loved that very Frederic Aylmer\nwhom her mind was thus condemning.\n\n\"I'm sure he does his duty as a member of Parliament very well,\" said\nClara.\n\n\"That alone would not be much; but when that is joined to so much\nthat is better, it is a great deal. I am told that very few of the\nmen in the House now are believers at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, aunt!\"\n\n\"It is terrible to think of, my dear.\"\n\n\"But, aunt; they have to take some oath, or something of that sort,\nto show that they are Christians.\"\n\n\"Not now, my dear. They've done away with all that since we had Jew\nmembers. An atheist can go into Parliament now; and I'm told that\nmost of them are that, or nearly as bad. I can remember when no\nPapist could sit in Parliament. But they seem to me to be doing away\nwith everything. It's a great comfort to me that Frederic is what he\nis.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it must be, aunt.\"\n\nThen there was a pause, during which, however, Mrs. Winterfield gave\nno sign that the conversation was to be considered as being over.\nClara knew her aunt's ways so well, that she was sure something more\nwas coming, and therefore waited patiently, without any thought of\ntaking up her book. \"I was speaking to him about you yesterday,\" Mrs.\nWinterfield said at last.\n\n\"That would not interest him very much.\"\n\n\"Why not? Do you suppose he is not interested in those I love?\nIndeed, it did interest him; and he told me what I did not know\nbefore, and what you ought to have told me.\"\n\nClara now blushed, she knew not why, and became agitated. \"I don't\nknow that I have kept anything from you that I ought to have told,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"He says that the provision made for you by your father has all been\nsquandered.\"\n\n\"If he used that word he has been very unkind,\" said Clara, angrily.\n\n\"I don't know what word he used, but he was not unkind at all; he\nnever is. I think he was very generous.\"\n\n\"I do not want his generosity, aunt.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense, my dear. If he has told me the truth, what have\nyou to depend on?\"\n\n\"I don't want to depend on anything. I hate hearing about it.\"\n\n\"Clara, I wonder you can talk in that way. If you were only seventeen\nit would be very foolish; but at your age it is inexcusable. When I\nam gone, and your father is gone, who is to provide for you? Will\nyour cousin do it--Mr. Belton, who is to have the property?\"\n\n\"Yes, he would--if I would let him;--of course I would not let him.\nBut, aunt, pray do not go on. I would sooner have to starve than talk\nabout it at all.\"\n\nThere was another pause; but Clara again knew that the conversation\nwas not over; and she knew also that it would be vain for her to\nendeavour to begin another subject. Nor could she think of anything\nelse to say, so much was she agitated.\n\n\"What makes you suppose that Mr. Belton would be so liberal?\" asked\nMrs. Winterfield.\n\n\"I don't know. I can't say. He is the nearest relation I shall have;\nand of all the people I ever knew he is the best, and the most\ngenerous, and the least selfish. When he came to us papa was quite\nhostile to him--disliking his very name; but when the time came, papa\ncould not bear to think of his going, because he had been so good.\"\n\n\"Clara!\"\n\n\"Well, aunt.\"\n\n\"I hope you know my affection for you.\"\n\n\"Of course I do, aunt; and I hope you trust mine for you also.\"\n\n\"Is there anything between you and Mr. Belton besides cousinship?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Because if I thought that, my trouble would of course be at an end.\"\n\n\"There is nothing;--but pray do not let me be a trouble to you.\"\nClara, for a moment, almost resolved to tell her aunt the whole\ntruth; but she remembered that she would be treating her cousin badly\nif she told the story of his rejection.\n\nThere was another short period of silence, and then Mrs. Winterfield\nwent on. \"Frederic thinks that I should make some provision for you\nby will. That, of course, is the same as though he offered to do it\nhimself. I told him that it would be so, and I read him my will last\nnight. He said that that made no difference, and recommended me to\nadd a codicil. I asked him how much I ought to give you, and he said\nfifteen hundred pounds. There will be as much as that after burying\nme without burden to the estate. You must acknowledge that he has\nbeen very generous.\"\n\nBut Clara, in her heart, did not at all thank Captain Aylmer for\nhis generosity. She would have had everything from him, or nothing.\nIt was grievous to her to think that she should owe to him a bare\npittance to keep her out of the workhouse,--to him who had twice\nseemed to be on the point of asking her to share everything with him.\nShe did not love her cousin Will as she loved him; but her cousin\nWill's assurance to her that he would treat her with a brother's\ncare was sweeter to her by far than Frederic Aylmer's well-balanced\ncounsel to his aunt on her behalf. In her present mood, too, she\nwanted no one to have forethought for her; she desired no provision;\nfor her, in the discomfiture of heart, there was consolation in the\nfeeling that when she should find herself alone in the world, she\nwould have been ill-treated by her friends all round her. There was a\ncharm in the prospect of her desolation of which she did not wish to\nbe robbed by the assurance of some seventy pounds a year, to be given\nto her by Captain Frederic Aylmer. To be robbed of one's grievance is\nthe last and foulest wrong,--a wrong under which the most enduring\ntemper will at last yield and become soured,--by which the strongest\nback will be broken. \"Well, my dear,\" continued Mrs. Winterfield,\nwhen Clara made no response to this appeal for praise.\n\n\"It is so hard for me to say anything about it, aunt. What can I say\nbut that I don't want to be a burden to any one?\"\n\n\"That is a position which very few women can attain,--that is, very\nfew single women.\"\n\n\"I think it would be well if all single women were strangled by the\ntime they are thirty,\" said Clara with a fierce energy which\nabsolutely frightened her aunt.\n\n\"Clara! how can you say anything so wicked,--so abominably wicked!\"\n\n\"Anything would be better than being twitted in this way. How can I\nhelp it that I am not a man and able to work for my bread? But I am\nnot above being a housemaid, and so Captain Aylmer shall find. I'd\nsooner be a housemaid, with nothing but my wages, than take the money\nwhich you say he is to give me. It will be of no use, aunt, for I\nshall not take it.\"\n\n\"It is I that am to leave it to you. It is not to be a present from\nFrederic.\"\n\n\"It is the same thing, aunt. He says you are to do it; and you told\nme just now that it was to come out of his pocket.\"\n\n\"I should have done it myself long ago, had you told me all the truth\nabout your father's affairs.\"\n\n\"How was I to tell you? I would sooner have bitten my tongue out. But\nI will tell you the truth now. If I had known that all this was to be\nsaid to me about money, and that our poverty was to be talked over\nbetween you and Captain Aylmer, I would not have come to Perivale. I\nwould rather that you should be angry with me and think that I had\nforgotten you.\"\n\n\"You would not say that, Clara, if you remembered that this will\nprobably be your last visit to me.\"\n\n\"No, no; it will not be the last. But do not talk about these things.\nAnd it will be so much better that I should be here when he is not\nhere.\"\n\n\"I had hoped that when I died you might both be with me together,--as\nhusband and wife.\"\n\n\"Such hopes never come to anything.\"\n\n\"I still think that he would wish it.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense, aunt. It is indeed, for neither of us wish it.\" A\nlie on such a subject from a woman under such circumstances is hardly\nto be considered a lie at all. It is spoken with no mean object, and\nis the only bulwark which the woman has ready at her need to cover\nher own weakness.\n\n\"From what he said yesterday,\" continued Mrs. Winterfield, \"I think\nit is your own fault.\"\n\n\"Pray,--pray do not talk in that way. It cannot be matter of any\nfault that two people do not want to marry each other.\"\n\n\"Of course I asked him no positive question. It would be indelicate\neven in me to have done that. But he spoke as though he thought very\nhighly of you.\"\n\n\"No doubt he does. And so do I of Mr. Possitt.\"\n\n\"Mr. Possitt is a very excellent young man,\" said Mrs. Winterfield,\ngravely. Mr. Possitt was, indeed, her favourite curate at Perivale,\nand always dined at the house on Sundays between services, when Mrs.\nWinterfield was very particular in seeing that he took two glasses of\nher best port wine to support him. \"But Mr. Possitt has nothing but\nhis curacy.\"\n\n\"There is no danger, aunt, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you call danger; but Frederic seemed to think that\nyou are always sharp with him. You don't want to quarrel with him, I\nhope, because I love him better than any one in the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, aunt, what cruel things you say to me without thinking of them!\"\n\n\"I do not mean to be cruel, but I will say nothing more about him. As\nI told you before, that I had not thought it expedient to leave away\nany portion of my little property from Frederic,--believing as I\ndid then, that the money intended for you by your father was still\nremaining,--it is best that you should now know that I have at last\nlearnt the truth, and that I will at once see my lawyer about making\nthis change.\"\n\n\"Dear aunt, of course I thank you.\"\n\n\"I want no thanks, Clara. I humbly strive to do what I believe to be\nmy duty. I have never felt myself to be more than a steward of my\nmoney. That I have often failed in my stewardship I know well;--for\nin what duties do we not all fail?\" Then she gently laid herself\nback in her arm-chair, closing her eyes, while she kept fast clasped\nin her hands the little book of daily devotion which she had been\nstriving to read when the conversation had been commenced. Clara\nknew then that nothing more was to be said, and that she was not at\npresent to interrupt her aunt. From her posture, and the closing of\nher eyelids, Mrs. Winterfield might have been judged to be asleep;\nbut Clara could see the gentle motion of her lips, and was aware that\nher aunt was solacing herself with prayer.\n\nClara was angry with herself, and angry with all the world. She knew\nthat the old lady who was sitting then before her was very good; and\nthat all this that had now been said had come from pure goodness, and\na desire that strict duty might be done; and Clara was angry with\nherself in that she had not been more ready with her thanks, and\nmore demonstrative with her love and gratitude. Mrs. Winterfield was\naffectionate as well as good, and her niece's coldness, as the niece\nwell knew, had hurt her sorely. But still what could Clara have done\nor said? She told herself that it was beyond her power to burst out\ninto loud praises of Captain Aylmer; and of such nature was the\ngratitude which Mrs. Winterfield had desired. She was not grateful\nto Captain Aylmer, and wanted nothing that was to come from his\ngenerosity. And then her mind went away to that other portion of her\naunt's discourse. Could it be possible that this man was in truth\nattached to her, and was repelled simply by her own manner? She was\naware that she had fallen into a habit of fighting with him, of\nsparring against him with words about indifferent things, and calling\nhis conduct in question in a manner half playful and half serious.\nCould it be the truth that she was thus robbing herself of that which\nwould be to her,--as to herself she had frankly declared,--the one\ntreasure which she would desire? Twice, as has been said before,\nwords had seemed to tremble on his lips which might have settled\nthe question for her for ever; and on both occasions, as she knew,\nshe herself had helped to laugh off the precious word that had been\ncoming. But had he been thoroughly in earnest,--in earnest as she\nwould have him to be,--no laugh would have deterred him from his\npurpose. Could she have laughed Will Belton out of his declaration?\n\nAt last the lips ceased to move, and she knew that her aunt was in\ntruth asleep. The poor old lady hardly ever slept at night; but\nnature, claiming something of its due, would give her rest such as\nthis in her arm-chair by the fire-side. They were sitting in a large\ndouble drawing-room upstairs, in which there were, as was customary\nwith Mrs. Winterfield in winter, two fires; and the candles were in\nthe back-room, while the two ladies sat in that looking out into the\nstreet. This Mrs. Winterfield did to save her eyes from the candles,\nand yet to be within reach of light if it were wanted. And Clara also\nsat motionless in the dark, careful not to disturb her aunt, and\ndesirous of being with her when she should awake. Captain Aylmer had\ndeclared his purpose of being home early from the Mayor's dinner, and\nthe ladies were to wait for his arrival before tea was brought to\nthem. Clara was herself almost asleep when the door was opened, and\nCaptain Aylmer entered the room.\n\n\"H--sh!\" she said, rising gently from her chair, and putting up her\nfinger. He saw her by the dull light of the fire, and closed the door\nwithout a sound. Clara then crept into the back-room, and he followed\nher with noiseless step. \"She did not sleep at all last night,\" said\nClara; \"and now the unusual excitement of the day has fatigued her,\nand I think it is better not to wake her.\" The rooms were large,\nand they were able to place themselves at such a distance from the\nsleeper that their low words could hardly disturb her.\n\n\"Was she very tired when she got home?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not very. She has been talking much since that.\"\n\n\"Has she spoken about her will to you?\"\n\n\"Yes;--she has.\"\n\n\"I thought she would.\" Then he was silent, as though he expected that\nshe would speak again on that matter. But she had no wish to discuss\nher aunt's will with him, and therefore, to break the silence, asked\nhim some trifling question. \"Are you not home earlier than you\nexpected?\"\n\n\"It was very dull, and there was nothing more to be said. I did come\naway early, and perhaps have given affront. I hope you will accept\nthe compliment implied.\"\n\n\"Your aunt will, when she wakes. She will be delighted to find you\nhere.\"\n\n\"I am awake,\" said Mrs. Winterfield. \"I heard Frederic come in. It is\nvery good of him to come so soon. Clara, my dear, we will have tea.\"\n\nDuring tea, Captain Aylmer was called upon to give an account of\nthe Mayor's feast,--how the rector had said grace before dinner,\nand Mr. Possitt had done so after dinner, and how the soup had been\nuneatable. \"Dear me!\" said Mrs. Winterfield. \"And yet his wife was\nhousekeeper formerly in a family that lived very well!\" The Mrs.\nWinterfields of this world allow themselves little spiteful pleasures\nof this kind, repenting of them, no doubt, in those frequent moments\nin which they talk to their friends of their own terrible vilenesses.\nCaptain Aylmer then explained that his own health had been drunk,\nand his aunt desired to know whether, in returning thanks, he had\nbeen able to say anything further against that wicked Divorce Act\nof Parliament. This her nephew was constrained to answer with a\nnegative, and so the conversation was carried on till tea was over.\nShe was very anxious to hear every word that he could be made to\nutter as to his own doings in Parliament, and as to his doings in\nPerivale, and hung upon him with that wondrous affection which old\npeople with warm hearts feel for those whom they have selected as\ntheir favourites. Clara saw it all, and knew that her aunt was almost\ndoting.\n\n\"I think I'll go up to bed now, my dears,\" said Mrs. Winterfield,\nwhen she had taken her cup of tea. \"I am tired with those weary\nstairs in the Town-hall, and I shall be better in my own room.\" Clara\noffered to go with her, but this attendance her aunt declined,--as\nshe did always. So the bell was rung, and the old maid-servant walked\noff with her mistress, and Miss Amedroz and Captain Aylmer were left\ntogether.\n\n\"I don't think she will last long,\" said Captain Aylmer, soon after\nthe door was closed.\n\n\"I should be sorry to believe that; but she is certainly much\naltered.\"\n\n\"She has great courage to keep her up,--and a feeling that she should\nnot give way, but do her duty to the last. In spite of all that,\nhowever, I can see how changed she is since the summer. Have you\never thought how sad it will be if she should be alone when the day\ncomes?\"\n\n\"She has Martha, who is more to her now than any one else,--unless it\nis you.\"\n\n\"You could not remain with her over Christmas, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Who, I? What would my father do? Papa is as old, or nearly as old,\nas my aunt.\"\n\n\"But he is strong.\"\n\n\"He is very lonely. He would be more lonely than she is, for he has\nno such servant as Martha to be with him. Women can do better than\nmen, I think, when they come to my aunt's age.\"\n\nFrom this they got into a conversation as to the character of the\nlady with whom they were both so nearly connected, and, in spite of\nall that Clara could do to prevent it, continual references were\nmade by Captain Aylmer to her money and her will, and the need of an\naddition to that will on Clara's behalf. At last she was driven to\nspeak out. \"Captain Aylmer,\" she said, \"the subject is so distasteful\nto me, that I must ask you not to speak about it.\"\n\n\"In my position I am driven to think about it.\"\n\n\"I cannot, of course, help your thoughts; but I can assure you that\nthey are unnecessary.\"\n\n\"It seems to me so hard that there should be such a gulf between you\nand me.\" This he said after he had been silent for a while; and as he\nspoke he looked away from her at the fire.\n\n\"I don't know that there is any particular gulf,\" she replied.\n\n\"Yes, there is. And it is you that make it. Whenever I attempt to\nspeak to you as a friend you draw yourself off from me, and shut\nyourself up. I know that it is not jealousy.\"\n\n\"Jealousy, Captain Aylmer!\"\n\n\"Jealousy with my aunt, I mean.\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"You are infinitely too proud for that; but I am sure that a stranger\nseeing it all would think that it was so.\"\n\n\"I don't know what it is that I do or that I ought not to do. But\nall my life everything that I have done at Perivale has always been\nwrong.\"\n\n\"It would have been so natural that you and I should be friends.\"\n\n\"If we are enemies, Captain Aylmer, I don't know it.\"\n\n\"But if ever I venture to speak of your future life you always repel\nme;--as though you were determined to let me know that it should not\nbe a matter of care to me.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I am determined to let you know. You are, or\nwill be, a rich man, and you have everything the world can give you.\nI am, or shall be, a very poor woman.\"\n\n\"Is that a reason why I should not be interested in your welfare?\"\n\n\"Yes;--the best reason in the world. We are not related to each\nother, though we have a common connection in dear Mrs. Winterfield.\nAnd nothing, to my idea, can be more objectionable than any sort of\ndependence from a woman of my age on a man of yours,--there being no\nreal tie of blood between them. I have spoken very plainly, Captain\nAylmer, for you have made me do it.\"\n\n\"Very plainly,\" he said.\n\n\"If I have said anything to offend you, I beg your pardon; but I was\ndriven to explain myself.\" Then she got up and took her bed-candle in\nher hand.\n\n\"You have not offended me,\" he said, as he also rose.\n\n\"Good-night, Captain Aylmer.\"\n\nHe took her hand and kept it. \"Say that we are friends.\"\n\n\"Why should we not be friends?\"\n\n\"There is no reason on my part why we should not be the dearest\nfriends,\" he said. \"Were it not that I am so utterly without\nencouragement, I should say the very dearest.\" He still held her\nhand, and was looking into her face as he spoke. For a moment she\nstood there, bearing his gaze, as though she expected some further\nwords to be spoken. Then she withdrew her hand, and again saying, in\na clear voice, \"Good-night, Captain Aylmer,\" she left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nCAPTAIN AYLMER'S PROMISE TO HIS AUNT.\n\n\nWhat had Captain Aylmer meant by telling her that they might be the\ndearest friends--by saying so much as that, and then saying no more?\nOf course Clara asked herself that question as soon as she was alone\nin her bedroom, after leaving Captain Aylmer below. And she made\ntwo answers to herself--two answers which were altogether distinct\nand contradictory one of the other. At first she decided that he\nhad said so much and no more because he was deceitful--because\nit suited his vanity to raise hopes which he had no intention of\nfulfilling--because he was fond of saying soft things which were\nintended to have no meaning. This was her first answer to herself.\nBut in her second she accused herself as much as she had before\naccused him. She had been cold to him, unfriendly, and harsh. As her\naunt had told her, she spoke sharp words to him, and repulsed the\nkindness which he offered her. What right had she to expect from him\na declaration of love when she was studious to stop him at every\navenue by which he might approach it? A little management on her\nside would, she almost knew, make things right. But then the idea of\nany such management distressed her;--nay, more, disgusted her. The\nmanagement, if any were necessary, must come from him. And it was\nmanifest enough that if he had any strong wishes in this matter he\nwas not a good manager. Her cousin, Will Belton, knew how to manage\nmuch better.\n\nOn the next morning, however, all her thoughts respecting Captain\nAylmer were dissipated by tidings which Martha brought to her\nbedside. Her aunt was ill. Martha was afraid that her mistress was\nvery ill. She did not dare to send specially for the doctor on her\nown responsibility, as Mrs. Winterfield had strong and peculiar\nfeelings about doctors' visits, and had on this very morning declined\nto be so visited. On the next day the doctor would come in the usual\ncourse of things, for she had submitted for some years back to such\nperiodical visitings; but she had desired that nothing might be done\nout of the common way. Martha, however, declared that if she were\nalone with her mistress the doctor would be sent for; and she now\npetitioned for aid from Clara. Clara was, of course, by her aunt's\nbedside in a few minutes, and in a few minutes more the doctor from\nthe other side of the way was there also.\n\nIt was ten o'clock before Captain Aylmer and Miss Amedroz met\nat breakfast, and they had before that been together in Mrs.\nWinterfield's room. The doctor had told Captain Aylmer that his aunt\nwas very ill--very ill, dangerously ill. She had been wrong to go\ninto such a place as the cold, unaired Town-hall, and that, too,\nin the month of November; and the fatigue had also been too much\nfor her. Mrs. Winterfield, too, had admitted to Clara that she knew\nherself to be very ill. \"I felt it coming on me last night,\" she\nsaid, \"when I was talking to you; and I felt it still more strongly\nwhen I left you after tea. I have lived long enough. God's will be\ndone.\" At that moment, when she said she had lived long enough, she\nforgot her intention with reference to her will. But she remembered\nit before Clara had left the room. \"Tell Frederic,\" she said, \"to\nsend at once for Mr. Palmer.\" Now Clara knew that Mr. Palmer was the\nattorney, and resolved that she would give no such message to Captain\nAylmer. But Mrs. Winterfield sent for her nephew, who had just left\nher, and herself gave her orders to him. In the course of the morning\nthere came tidings from the attorney's office that Mr. Palmer was\naway from Perivale, that he would be back on the morrow, and that he\nwould of course wait on Mrs. Winterfield immediately on his return.\n\nCaptain Aylmer and Miss Amedroz discussed nothing but their aunt's\nstate of health that morning over the breakfast-table. Of course,\nunder such circumstances in the house, there was no further immediate\nreference made to that offer of dearest friendship. It was clear to\nthem both that the doctor did not expect that Mrs. Winterfield would\nagain leave her bed; and it was clear to Clara also that her aunt was\nof the same opinion.\n\n\"I shall hardly be able to go home now,\" she said.\n\n\"It will be kind of you if you can remain.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I shall remain over the Sunday. If by that time she is at all\nbetter, I will run up to town and come down again before the end of\nthe week. I know you don't believe it, but a man really has some\nthings which he must do.\"\n\n\"I don't disbelieve you, Captain Aylmer.\"\n\n\"But you must write to me daily if I do go.\"\n\nTo this Clara made no objection;--and she must write also to some one\nelse. She must let her cousin know how little chance there was that\nshe would be at home at Christmas, explaining to him at the same time\nthat his visit to her father would on that account be all the more\nwelcome.\n\n\"Are you going to her now?\" he asked, as Clara got up immediately\nafter breakfast. \"I shall be in the house all the morning, and if you\nwant me you will of course send for me.\"\n\n\"She may perhaps like to see you.\"\n\n\"I will come up every now and again. I would remain there altogether,\nonly I should be in the way.\" Then he got a newspaper and made\nhimself comfortable over the fire, while she went up to her weary\ntask in her aunt's room.\n\nNeither on that day nor on the next did the lawyer come, and on\nthe following morning all earthly troubles were over with Mrs.\nWinterfield. It was early on the Sunday morning that she died, and\nlate on the Saturday evening Mr. Palmer had sent up to say that\nhe had been detained at Taunton, but that he would wait on Mrs.\nWinterfield early on the Monday morning. On the Friday the poor lady\nhad said much on the subject, but had been comforted by an assurance\nfrom her nephew that the arrangement should be carried out exactly\nas she wished it, whether the codicil was or was not added to the\nwill. To Clara she said nothing more on the subject, nor at such a\ntime did Captain Aylmer feel that he could offer her any assurance\non the matter. But Clara knew that the will was not altered; and\nthough at the time she was not thinking much about money, she had,\nnevertheless, very clearly made up her own mind as to her own\nconduct. Nothing should induce her to take a present of fifteen\nhundred pounds,--or, indeed, of as many pence from Captain Aylmer.\nDuring those hours of sickness in the house they had been much thrown\ntogether, and no one could have been kinder or more gentle to her\nthan he had been. He had come to call her Clara, as people will do\nwhen joined together in such duties, and had been very pleasant as\nwell as affectionate in his manner with her. It had seemed to her\nthat he also wished to take upon himself the cares and love of an\nadopted brother. But as an adopted brother she would have nothing\nto do with him. The two men whom she liked best in the world would\nassume each the wrong place; and between them both she felt that she\nwould be left friendless.\n\nOn the Saturday afternoon they had both surmised how it was going to\nbe with Mrs. Winterfield, and Captain Aylmer had told Mr. Palmer that\nhe feared his coming on the Monday would be useless. He explained\nalso what was required, and declared that he would be at once ready\nto make good the deficiency in the will. Mr. Palmer seemed to think\nthat this would be better even than the making of a codicil in the\nlast moments of the lady's life; and, therefore, he and Captain\nAylmer were at rest on that subject.\n\nDuring the greater part of the Saturday night both Clara and Captain\nAylmer remained with their aunt; and once when the morning was almost\nthere, and the last hour was near at hand, she had said a word or two\nwhich both of them had understood, in which she implored her darling\nFrederic to take a brother's care of Clara Amedroz. Even in that\nmoment Clara had repudiated the legacy, feeling sure in her heart\nthat Frederic Aylmer was aware what was the nature of the care which\nhe ought to owe, if he would consent to owe any care to her. He\npromised his aunt that he would do as she desired him, and it was\nimpossible that Clara should then, aloud, repudiate the compact. But\nshe said nothing, merely allowing her hand to rest with his beneath\nthe thin, dry hand of the dying woman. To her aunt, however, when for\na moment they were alone together, she showed all possible affection,\nwith thanks and tears, and warm kisses, and prayers for forgiveness\nas to all those matters in which she had offended. \"My pretty\none;--my dear,\" said the old woman, raising her hand on to the head\nof the crouching girl, who was hiding her moist eyes on the bed.\nNever during her life had her aunt appeared to her in so loving\na mood as now, when she was leaving it. Then, with some eager\nimpassioned words, in which she pronounced her ideas of what should\nbe the religious duties of a woman, Mrs. Winterfield bade farewell\nto her niece. After that, she had a longer interview with her nephew,\nand then it seemed that all worldly cares were over with her.\n\nThe Sunday was passed in all that blankness of funeral grief which is\nabsolutely necessary on such occasions. It cannot be said that either\nClara or Captain Aylmer were stricken with any of that agony of woe\nwhich is produced on us by the death of those whom we have loved so\nwell that we cannot bring ourselves to submit to part with them. They\nwere both truly sorry for their aunt, in the common parlance of the\nworld; but their sorrow was of that modified sort which does not numb\nthe heart, and make the surviving sufferer feel that there never can\nbe a remedy. Nevertheless, it demanded sad countenances, few words,\nand those spoken hardly above a whisper; an absence of all amusement\nand almost of all employment, and a full surrender to the trappings\nof woe. They two were living together without other companion in the\nbig house,--sitting down together to dinner and to tea; but on this\nday hardly a dozen words were spoken between them, and those dozen\nwere spoken with no purport. On the Monday Captain Aylmer gave orders\nfor the funeral, and then went away to London, undertaking to be back\non the day before the last ceremony. Clara was rather glad that he\nshould be gone, though she feared the solitude of the big house. She\nwas glad that he should be gone, as she found it impossible to talk\nto him with ease to herself. She knew that he was about to assume\nsome position as protector or quasi guardian over her, in conformity\nwith her aunt's express wish, and she was quite resolved that she\nwould submit to no such guardianship from his hands. That being so,\nthe shorter period there might be for any such discussion the better.\n\nThe funeral was to take place on the Saturday, and during the four\ndays that intervened she received two visits from Mr. Possitt. Mr.\nPossitt was very discreet in what he said, and Clara was angry with\nherself for not allowing his words to have any avail with her. She\ntold herself that they were commonplace; but she told herself, also,\nafter his first visit, that she had no right to expect anything else\nbut commonplace words. How often are men found who can speak words\non such occasions that are not commonplaces,--that really stir the\nsoul, and bring true comfort to the listener? The humble listener\nmay receive comfort even from commonplace words; but Clara was not\nhumble, and rebuked herself for her own pride. On the second occasion\nof his coming she did endeavour to receive him with a meek heart,\nand to accept what he said with an obedient spirit. But the struggle\nwithin her bosom was hard, and when he bade her to kneel and pray\nwith him, she doubted for a moment between rebellion and hypocrisy.\nBut she had determined to be meek, and so hypocrisy carried the hour.\n\nWhat would a clergyman say on such an occasion if the object of his\nsolicitude were to decline the offer, remarking that prayer at that\nmoment did not seem to be opportune; and that, moreover, he, the\nperson thus invited, would like, first of all, to know what was to\nbe the special object of the proposed prayer, if he found that he\ncould, at the spur of the moment, bring himself at all into a fitting\nmood for the task? Of him who would decline, without argument, the\nclergyman would opine that he was simply a reprobate. Of him who\nwould propose to accompany an hypothetical acceptance with certain\nstipulations, he would say to himself that he was a stiff-necked\nwrestler against grace, whose condition was worse than that of the\nreprobate. Men and women, conscious that they will be thus judged,\nsubmit to the hypocrisy, and go down upon their knees unprepared,\nmaking no effort, doing nothing while they are there, allowing their\nconsciences to be eased if they can only feel themselves numbed into\nsome ceremonial awe by the occasion. So it was with Clara, when Mr.\nPossitt, with easy piety, went through the formula of his devotion,\nhardly ever having realised to himself the fact that, of all works in\nwhich man can engage himself, that of prayer is the most difficult.\n\n\"It is a sad loss to me,\" said Mr. Possitt, as he sat for half an\nhour with Clara, after she had thus submitted herself. Mr. Possitt\nwas a weakly, pale-faced little man, who worked so hard in the parish\nthat on every day, Sundays included, he went to bed as tired in all\nhis bones as a day labourer from the fields;--\"a very great loss.\nThere are not many now who understand what a clergyman has to go\nthrough, as our dear friend did.\" If he was mindful of his two\nglasses of port wine on Sundays, who could blame him?\n\n\"She was a very kind woman, Mr. Possitt.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed;--and so thoughtful! That she will have an exceeding\ngreat reward, who can doubt? Since I knew her she always lived as a\nsaint upon earth. I suppose there's nothing known as to who will live\nin this house, Miss Amedroz?\"\n\n\"Nothing;--I should think.\"\n\n\"Captain Aylmer won't keep it in his own hands?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell in the least; but as he is obliged to live in London\nbecause of Parliament, and goes to Yorkshire always in the autumn, he\ncan hardly want it.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. But it will be a sad loss,--a sad loss to have this\nhouse empty. Ah!--I shall never forget her kindness to me. Do you\nknow, Miss Amedroz,\"--and as he told his little secret he became\nbeautifully confidential;--\"do you know, she always used to send me\nten guineas at Christmas to help me along. She understood, as well as\nany one, how hard it is for a gentleman to live on seventy pounds a\nyear. You will not wonder that I should feel that I've had a loss.\"\nIt is hard for a gentleman to live upon seventy pounds a year; and it\nis very hard, too, for a lady to live upon nothing a year, which lot\nin life fate seemed to have in store for Miss Amedroz.\n\nOn the Friday evening Captain Aylmer came back, and Clara was in\ntruth glad to see him. Her aunt's death had been now far enough back\nto admit of her telling Martha that she would not dine till Captain\nAylmer had come, and to allow her to think somewhat of his comfort.\nPeople must eat and drink even when the grim monarch is in the house;\nand it is a relief when they first dare to do so with some attention\nto the comforts which are ordinarily so important to them. For\nthemselves alone women seldom care to exercise much trouble in this\ndirection; but the presence of a man at once excuses and renders\nnecessary the ceremony of a dinner. So Clara prepared for the\narrival, and greeted the comer with some returning pleasantness of\nmanner. And he, too, was pleasant with her, telling her of his plans,\nand speaking to her as though she were one of those whom it was\nnatural that he should endeavour to interest in his future welfare.\n\n\"When I come back to-morrow,\" he said, \"the will must be opened and\nread. It had better be done here.\" They were sitting over the fire in\nthe dining-room, after dinner, and Clara knew that the coming back\nto which he alluded was his return from the funeral. But she made no\nanswer to this, as she wished to say nothing about her aunt's will.\n\"And after that,\" he continued, \"you had better let me take you out.\"\n\n\"I am very well,\" she said. \"I do not want any special taking out.\"\n\n\"But you have been confined to the house the whole week.\"\n\n\"Women are accustomed to that, and do not feel it as you would.\nHowever, I will walk with you if you'll take me.\"\n\n\"Of course I'll take you. And then we must settle our future plans.\nHave you fixed upon any day yet for returning? Of course, the longer\nyou stay, the kinder you will be.\"\n\n\"I can do no good to any one by staying.\"\n\n\"You do good to me;--but I suppose I'm nobody. I wish I could tell\nwhat to do about this house. Dear, good old woman! I know she would\nhave wished that I should keep it in my own hands, with some idea of\nliving here at some future time;--but of course I never shall live\nhere.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Would you like it yourself?\"\n\n\"I am not Member of Parliament for Perivale, and should not be the\nleading person in the town. You would be a sort of king here; and\nthen, some day, you will have your mother's property as well as your\naunt's; and you would be near to your own tenants.\"\n\n\"But that does not answer my question. Could you bring yourself to\nlive here,--even if it were your own?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it is so deadly dull;--because it has no attraction\nwhatever;--because of all lives it is the one you would like the\nleast. No one should live in a provincial town but they who make\ntheir money by doing so.\"\n\n\"And what are the wives and daughters of such people to do,--and\nespecially their widows? I have no doubt I could live here very\nhappily if I had anybody near me that I liked. I should not wish to\nhave to depend altogether on Mr. Possitt for society.\"\n\n\"And you would find him about the best.\"\n\n\"Mr. Possitt has been with me twice whilst you were away, and he,\ntoo, asked what you meant to do about the house.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"What could I say? Of course I said I did not know. I suppose he\nwas meditating whether you would live here and ask him to dinner on\nSundays!\"\n\n\"Mr. Possitt is a very good sort of man,\" said the Captain,\ngravely;--for Captain Aylmer, in the carrying out of his principles,\nalways spoke seriously of everything connected with the Church in\nPerivale.\n\n\"And quite worthy to be asked to dinner on Sundays,\" said Clara. \"But\nI did not give him any hope. How could I? Of course I knew that you\nwould not live here, though I did not tell him so.\"\n\n\"No; I don't suppose I shall. But I see very plainly that you think\nI ought to do so.\"\n\n\"I've the old-fashioned idea as to a man's living near to his own\nproperty; that is all. No doubt it was good for other people in\nPerivale, besides Mr. Possitt, that my dear aunt lived here; and if\nthe house is shut up, or let to some stranger, they will feel her\nloss the more. But I don't know that you are bound to sacrifice\nyourself to them.\"\n\n\"If I were to marry,\" said Captain Aylmer, very slowly and in a low\nvoice, \"of course I should have to think of my wife's wishes.\"\n\n\"But if your wife, when she accepted you, knew that you were living\nhere, she would hardly take upon herself to demand that you should\ngive up your residence.\"\n\n\"She might find it very dull.\"\n\n\"She would make her own calculations as to that before she accepted\nyou.\"\n\n\"No doubt;--but I can't fancy any woman taking a man who was tied by\nhis leg to Perivale. What do the people do who live in Perivale?\"\n\n\"Earn their bread.\"\n\n\"Yes;--that's just what I said. But I shouldn't earn mine here.\"\n\n\"I have the feeling I spoke of very strongly about papa's place,\"\nsaid Clara, changing the conversation suddenly. \"I very often think\nof the future fate of Belton Castle when papa shall have gone. My\ncousin has got his house at Plaistow, and I don't suppose he'd live\nthere.\"\n\n\"And where will you go?\" he asked.\n\nAs soon as she had spoken, Clara regretted her own imprudence in\nhaving ventured to speak upon her own affairs. She had been well\npleased to hear him talk of his plans, and had been quite resolved\nnot to talk of her own. But now, by her own speech, she had set him\nto make inquiries as to her future life. She did not at first answer\nthe question; but he repeated it. \"And where will you live yourself?\"\n\n\"I hope I may not have to think of that for some time to come yet.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to help thinking of such things.\"\n\n\"I can assure you that I haven't thought about it; but I suppose I\nshall endeavour to--to--; I don't know what I shall endeavour to do.\"\n\n\"Will you come and live at Perivale?\"\n\n\"Why here more than anywhere else?\"\n\n\"In this house I mean.\"\n\n\"That would suit me admirably;--would it not? I'm afraid Mr. Possitt\nwould not find me a good neighbour. To tell the truth, I think that\nany lady who lives here alone ought to be older than I am. The\nPerivalians would not show to a young woman that sort of respect\nwhich they have always felt for this house.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean alone,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\nThen Clara got up and made some excuse for leaving him, and there was\nnothing more said between them,--nothing, at least, of moment, on\nthat evening. She had become uneasy when he asked her whether she\nwould like to live in his house at Perivale. But afterwards, when he\nsuggested that she was to have some companion with her there, she\nfelt herself compelled to put an end to the conversation. And yet she\nknew that this was always the way, both with him and with herself. He\nwould say things which would seem to promise that in another minute\nhe would be at her feet, and then he would go no further. And she,\nwhen she heard those words,--though in truth she would have had him\nat her feet if she could,--would draw away, and recede, and forbid\nhim as it were to go on. But Clara continued to make her comparisons,\nand knew well that her cousin Will would have gone on in spite of any\nsuch forbiddings.\n\nOn that night, however, when she was alone, she could console herself\nwith thinking how right she had been. In that front bedroom, the\ndoor of which was opposite to her own, with closed shutters, in the\nterrible solemnity of lifeless humanity, was still lying the body of\nher aunt! What would she have thought of herself if at such a moment\nshe could have listened to words of love, and promised herself as a\nwife while such an inmate was in the house? She little knew that he,\nwithin that same room, had pledged himself, to her who was now lying\nthere waiting for her last removal--had pledged himself, just seven\ndays since, to make the offer which, when he was talking to her, she\nwas always half hoping and half fearing!\n\nHe could have meant nothing else when he told her that he had not\nintended to suggest that she should live there alone in that great\nhouse at Perivale. She could not hinder herself from thinking of\nthis, unfit as was the present moment for any such thoughts. How was\nit possible that she should not speculate on the subject, let her\nresolutions against any such speculation be ever so strong? She had\nconfessed to herself that she loved the man, and what else could she\nwish but that he also should love her? But there came upon her some\nfaint suspicion--some glimpse of what was almost a dream--that he\nmight possibly in this matter be guided rather by duty than by love.\nIt might be that he would feel himself constrained to offer his hand\nto her--constrained by the peculiarity of his position towards her.\nIf so--should she discover that such were his motives--there would be\nno doubt as to the nature of her answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nSHOWING HOW CAPTAIN AYLMER KEPT HIS PROMISE.\n\n\nThe next day was necessarily very sad. Clara had declared her\ndetermination to follow her aunt to the churchyard, and did so,\ntogether with Martha, the old servant. There were three or four\nmourning coaches, as family friends came over from Taunton, one\nor two of whom were to be present at the reading of the will. How\nmelancholy was the occasion, and how well the work was done; how\nsubstantial and yet how solemn was the luncheon, spread after the\nfuneral for the gentlemen; and how the will was read, without a\nword of remark, by Mr. Palmer, need hardly be told here. The will\ncontained certain substantial legacies to servants--the amount to\nthat old handmaid Martha being so great as to produce a fit of\nfainting, after which the old handmaid declared that if ever there\nwas, by any chance, an angel of light upon the earth, it was her late\nmistress; and yet Martha had had her troubles with her mistress; and\nthere was a legacy of two hundred pounds to the gentleman who was\ncalled upon to act as co-executor with Captain Aylmer. Other clause\nin the will there was none, except that one substantial clause which\nbequeathed to her well-beloved nephew, Frederic Folliott Aylmer,\neverything of which the testatrix died possessed. The will had been\nmade at some moment in which Clara's spirit of independence had\noffended her aunt, and her name was not mentioned. That nothing\nshould have been left to Clara was the one thing that surprised the\nrelatives from Taunton who were present. The relatives from Taunton,\nto give them their due, expected nothing for themselves; but as there\nhad been great doubt as to the proportions in which the property\nwould be divided between the nephew and adopted niece, there was\naroused a considerable excitement as to the omission of the name of\nMiss Amedroz--an excitement which was not altogether unpleasant. When\npeople complain of some cruel shame, which does not affect themselves\npersonally, the complaint is generally accompanied by an unexpressed\nand unconscious feeling of satisfaction.\n\nOn the present occasion, when the will had been read and refolded,\nCaptain Aylmer, who was standing on the rug near the fire, spoke a\nfew words. His aunt, he said, had desired to add a codicil to the\nwill, of the nature of which Mr. Palmer was well aware. She had\nexpressed her intention to leave fifteen hundred pounds to her\nniece, Miss Amedroz; but death had come upon her too quickly to\nenable her to perform her purpose. Of this intention on the part of\nMrs. Winterfield, Mr. Palmer was as well aware as himself; and he\nmentioned the subject now, merely with the object of saying that, as\na matter of course, the legacy to Miss Amedroz was as good as though\nthe codicil had been completed. On such a question as that there\ncould arise no question as to legal right; but he understood that the\nlegal claim of Miss Amedroz, under such circumstances, was as valid\nas his own. It was therefore no affair of generosity on his part.\nThen there was a little buzz of satisfaction on the part of those\npresent, and the meeting was broken up.\n\nA certain old Mrs. Folliott, who was cousin to everybody concerned,\nhad come over from Taunton to see how things were going. She had\nalways been at variance with Mrs. Winterfield, being a woman who\nloved cards and supper parties, and who had throughout her life\nstabled her horses in stalls very different to those used by the\nlady of Perivale. Now this Mrs. Folliott was the first to tell Clara\nof the will. Clara, of course, was altogether indifferent. She had\nknown for months past that her aunt had intended to leave nothing\nto her, and her only hope had been that she might be left free from\nany commiseration or remark on the subject. But Mrs. Folliott, with\nsundry shakings of the head, told her how her aunt had omitted to\nname her--and then told her also of Captain Aylmer's generosity.\n\"We all did think, my dear,\" said Mrs. Folliott, \"that she would\nhave done better than that for you, or at any rate that she would\nnot have left you dependent on him.\" Captain Aylmer's horses were\nalso supposed to be stabled in strictly Low Church stalls, and were\ntherefore regarded by Mrs. Folliott with much dislike.\n\n\"I and my aunt understood each other perfectly,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I dare say. But if so, you really were the only person that did\nunderstand her. No doubt what she did was quite right, seeing that\nshe was a saint; but we sinners would have thought it very wicked to\nhave made such a will, and then to have trusted to the generosity of\nanother person after we were dead.\"\n\n\"But there is no question of trusting to any one's generosity, Mrs.\nFolliott.\"\n\n\"He need not pay you a shilling, you know, unless he likes it.\"\n\n\"And he will not be asked to pay me a shilling.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose he will go back after what he has said publicly.\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Folliott,\" said Clara earnestly, \"pray do not let us\ntalk about it. It is quite unnecessary. I never expected any of my\naunt's property, and knew all along that it was to go to Captain\nAylmer,--who, indeed, was Mrs. Winterfield's heir naturally. Mrs.\nWinterfield was not really my aunt, and I had no claim on her.\"\n\n\"But everybody understood that she was to provide for you.\"\n\n\"As I was not one of the everybodies myself, it will not signify.\"\nThen Mrs. Folliott retreated, having, as she thought, performed her\nduty to Clara, and contented herself henceforth with abusing Mrs.\nWinterfield's will in her own social circles at Taunton.\n\nOn the evening of that day, when all the visitors were gone and the\nhouse was again quiet, Captain Aylmer thought it expedient to explain\nto Clara the nature of his aunt's will, and the manner in which she\nwould be allowed to inherit under it the amount of money which her\naunt had intended to bequeath to her. When she became impatient and\nobjected to listen to him, he argued with her, pointing out to her\nthat this was a matter of business to which it was now absolutely\nnecessary that she should attend. \"It may be the case,\" he said,\n\"and, indeed, I hope it will, that no essential difference will be\nmade by it;--except that it will gratify you to know how careful\nshe was of your interests in her last moments. But you are bound in\nduty to learn your own position; and I, as her executor, am bound to\nexplain it to you. But perhaps you would rather discuss it with Mr.\nPalmer.\"\n\n\"Oh no;--save me from that.\"\n\n\"You must understand, then, that I shall pay over to you the sum of\nfifteen hundred pounds as soon as the will has been proved.\"\n\n\"I understand nothing of the kind. I know very well that if I were\nto take it, I should be accepting a present from you, and to that I\ncannot consent.\"\n\n\"But Clara--\"\n\n\"It is no good, Captain Aylmer. Though I don't pretend to understand\nmuch about law, I do know that I can have no claim to anything that\nis not put into the will; and I won't have what I could not claim.\nMy mind is quite made up, and I hope I mayn't be annoyed about it.\nNothing is more disagreeable than having to discuss money matters.\"\n\nPerhaps Captain Aylmer thought that the having no money matters to\ndiscuss might be even more disagreeable. \"Well,\" he said, \"I can only\nask you to consult any friend whom you can trust upon the matter. Ask\nyour father, or Mr. Belton, and I have no doubt that either of them\nwill tell you that you are as much entitled to the legacy as though\nit had been written in the will.\"\n\n\"On such a matter, Captain Aylmer, I don't want to ask anybody. You\ncan't pay me the money unless I choose to take it, and I certainly\nshall not do that.\" Upon hearing this he smiled, assuming, as\nClara fancied that he was sometimes wont to do, a look of quiet\nsuperiority; and then, for that time, he allowed the subject to be\ndropped between them.\n\nBut Clara knew that she must discuss it at length with her father,\nand the fear of that discussion made her unhappy. She had already\nwritten to say that she would return home on the day but one after\nthe funeral, and had told Captain Aylmer of her purpose. So very\nprudent a man as he of course could not think it right that a young\nlady should remain with him, in his house, as his visitor; and to her\ndecision on this point he had made no objection. She now heartily\nwished that she had named the day after the funeral, and that she\nhad not been deterred by her dislike of making a Sunday journey. She\ndreaded this day, and would have been very thankful if he would have\nleft her and gone back to London. But he intended, he said, to remain\nat Perivale throughout the next week, and she must endure the day as\nbest she might be able. She wished that it were possible to ask Mr.\nPossitt to his accustomed dinner; but she did not dare to make the\nproposition to the master of the house. Though Captain Aylmer had\ndeclared Mr. Possitt to be a very worthy man, Clara surmised that he\nwould not be anxious to commence that practice of a Sabbatical dinner\nso soon after his aunt's decease. The day, after all, would be but\none day, and Clara schooled herself into a resolution to bear it with\ngood humour.\n\nCaptain Aylmer had made a positive promise to his aunt on her\ndeathbed that he would ask Clara Amedroz to be his wife, and he had\nno more idea of breaking his word than he had of resigning the whole\nproperty which had been left to him. Whether Clara would accept him\nhe had much doubt. He was a man by no means brilliant, not naturally\nself-confident, nor was he, perhaps, to be credited with the\npossession of high principles of the finest sort; but he was clever,\nin the ordinary sense of the word, knowing his own interest, knowing,\ntoo, that that interest depended on other things besides money; and\nhe was a just man, according to the ordinary rules of justice in the\nworld. Not for the first time, when he was sitting by the bedside of\nhis dying aunt, had he thought of asking Clara to marry him. Though\nhe had never hitherto resolved that he would do so--though he had\nnever till then brought himself absolutely to determine that he would\ntake so important a step--he had pondered over it often, and was\naware that he was very fond of Clara. He was, in truth, as much in\nlove with her as it was in his nature to be in love. He was not a\nman to break his heart for a girl;--nor even to make a strong fight\nfor a wife, as Belton was prepared to do. If refused once, he might\nprobably ask again,--having some idea that a first refusal was not\nalways intended to mean much,--and he might possibly make a third\nattempt, prompted by some further calculation of the same nature. But\nit might be doubted whether, on the first, second, or third occasion,\nhe would throw much passion into his words; and those who knew him\nwell would hardly expect to see him die of a broken heart, should he\nultimately be unsuccessful.\n\nWhen he had first thought of marrying Miss Amedroz he had imagined\nthat she would have shared with him his aunt's property, and indeed\nsuch had been his belief up to the days of the last illness of Mrs.\nWinterfield. The match therefore had recommended itself to him as\nbeing prudent as well as pleasant; and though his aunt had never\nhitherto pressed the matter upon him, he had understood what her\nwishes were. When she first told him, three or four days before her\ndeath, that her property was left altogether to him, and then, on\nhearing how totally her niece was without hope of provision from her\nfather, had expressed her desire to give a sum of money to Clara, she\nhad spoken plainly of her desire;--but she had not on that occasion\nasked him for any promise. But afterwards, when she knew that she was\ndying, she had questioned him as to his own feelings, and he, in his\nanxiety to gratify her in her last wishes, had given her the promise\nwhich she was so anxious to hear. He made no difficulty in doing so.\nIt was his own wish as well as hers. In a money point of view he\nmight no doubt now do better; but then money was not everything. He\nwas very fond of Clara, and felt that if she would accept him he\nwould be proud of his wife. She was well born and well educated, and\nit was the proper sort of thing for him to do. No doubt he had some\nidea, seeing how things had now arranged themselves, that he would\nbe giving much more than he would get; and perhaps the manner of\nhis offer might be affected by that consideration; but not on that\naccount did he feel at all sure that he would be accepted. Clara\nAmedroz was a proud girl,--perhaps too proud. Indeed, it was her\nfault. If her pride now interfered with her future fortune in life,\nit should be her own fault, not his. He would do his duty to her and\nto his aunt;--he would do it perseveringly and kindly; and then, if\nshe refused him, the fault would not be his.\n\nSuch, I think, was the state of Captain Aylmer's mind when he got up\non the Sunday morning, resolving that he would on that day make good\nhis promise. And it must be remembered, on his behalf, that he would\nhave prepared himself for his task with more animation if he had\nhitherto received warmer encouragement. He had felt himself to be\nrepulsed in the little efforts which he had already made to please\nthe lady, and had no idea whatever as to the true state of her\nfeelings. Had he known what she knew, he would, I think, have been\nanimated enough, and gone to his task as happy and thriving a lover\nas any. But he was a man somewhat diffident of himself, though\nsufficiently conscious of the value of the worldly advantages which\nhe possessed;--and he was, perhaps, a little afraid of Clara, giving\nher credit for an intellect superior to his own.\n\nHe had promised to walk with her on the Saturday after the reading\nof the will, intending to take her out through the gardens down to\na farm, now belonging to himself, which lay at the back of the town,\nand which was held by an old widow who had been senior in life to\nher late landlady; but no such walk had been possible, as it was\ndark before the last of the visitors from Taunton had gone. At\nbreakfast on Sunday he again proposed the walk, offering to take her\nimmediately after luncheon. \"I suppose you will not go to church?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Not to-day. I could hardly bring myself to do it to-day.\"\n\n\"I think you are right. I shall go. A man can always do these things\nsooner than a lady can. But you will come out afterwards?\" To this\nshe assented, and then she was left alone throughout the morning.\nThe walk she did not mind. That she and Captain Aylmer should walk\ntogether was all very well. They might probably have done so had Mrs.\nWinterfield been still alive. It was the long evening afterwards that\nshe dreaded--the long winter evening, in which she would have to sit\nwith him as his guest, and with him only. She could not pass these\nhours without talking to him, and she felt that she could not talk to\nhim naturally and easily. It would, however, be but for once, and she\nwould bear it.\n\nThey went together down to the house of Mrs. Partridge, the tenant,\nand made their kindly speeches to the old woman. Mrs. Partridge\nalready knew that Captain Aylmer was to be her landlord, but having\nhitherto seen more of Miss Amedroz than of the Captain, and having\nalways regarded her landlady's niece as being connected irrevocably\nwith the property, she addressed them as though the estate were a\njoint affair.\n\n\"I shan't be here to trouble you long;--that I shan't, Miss Clara,\"\nsaid the old woman.\n\n\"I am sure Captain Aylmer would be very sorry to lose you,\" replied\nClara, speaking loud, and close to the poor woman's ear, for she was\ndeaf.\n\n\"I never looked to live after she was gone, Miss Clara;--never. No\nmore I didn't. Deary;--deary! And I suppose you'll be living at the\nbig house now; won't ye?\"\n\n\"The big house belongs to Captain Aylmer, Mrs. Partridge.\" She was\ndriven to bawl out her words, and by no means liked the task. Then\nCaptain Aylmer said something, but his speech was altogether lost.\n\n\"Oh;--it belongs to the Captain, do it? They told me that was the way\nof the will; but I suppose it's all one.\"\n\n\"Yes; it's all one,\" said Captain Aylmer, gaily.\n\n\"It's not exactly all one, as you call it,\" said Clara, attempting to\nlaugh, but still shouting at the top of her voice.\n\n\"Ah;--I don't understand; but I hope you'll both live there\ntogether,--and I hope you'll be as good to the poor as she that is\ngone. Well, well; I didn't ever think that I should be still here,\nwhile she is lying under the stones up in the old church!\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer had determined that he would ask his question on the\nway back from the farm, and now resolved that he might as well begin\nwith some allusion to Mrs. Partridge's words about the house. The\nafternoon was bright and cold, and the lane down to the farmhouse\nhad been dried by the wind, so that the day was pleasant for walking.\n\"We might as well go on to the bridge,\" he said, as they left the\nfarm-yard. \"I always think that Perivale church looks better from\nCreevy bridge than any other point.\" Perivale church stood high in\nthe centre of the town, on an eminence, and was graced with a spire\nwhich was declared by the Perivalians to be preferable to that of\nSalisbury in proportion, though it was acknowledged to be somewhat\ninferior to it in height. The little river Creevy, which ran through\na portion of the suburbs of the town, and which, as there seen, was\nhardly more than a ditch, then sloped away behind Creevy Grange, as\nthe farm of Mrs. Partridge was called, and was crossed by a small\nwooden bridge, from which there was a view, not only of the church,\nbut of all that side of the hill on which Mrs. Winterfield's large\nbrick house stood conspicuously. So they walked down to Creevy\nbridge, and, when there, stood leaning on the parapet and looking\nback upon the town.\n\n\"How well I know every house and spot in the place as I see them from\nhere,\" he said.\n\n\"A good many of the houses are your own,--or will be some day; and\ntherefore you should know them.\"\n\n\"I remember, when I used to be here as a boy fishing, I always\nthought Aunt Winterfield's house was the biggest house in the\ncounty.\"\n\n\"It can't be nearly so large as your father's house in Yorkshire.\"\n\n\"No; certainly it is not. Aylmer Park is a large place; but the house\ndoes not stretch itself out so wide as that; nor does it stand on\nthe side of a hill so as to show out its proportions with so much\nostentation. The coach-house and the stables, and the old brewhouse,\nseem to come half way down the hill. And when I was a boy I had much\nmore respect for my aunt's red-brick house in Perivale than I had for\nAylmer Park.\"\n\n\"And now it's your own.\"\n\n\"Yes; now it's my own,--and all my respect for it is gone. I used to\nthink the Creevy the best river in England for fish; but I wouldn't\ngive a sixpence now for all the perch I ever caught in it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your taste for perch is gone also.\"\n\n\"Yes; and my taste for jam. I never believed in the store-room at\nAylmer Park as I did in my aunt's store-room here.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt but what it is full now.\"\n\n\"I dare say; but I shall never have the curiosity even to inquire.\nAh, dear,--I wish I knew what to do about the house.\"\n\n\"You won't sell it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not if I could either live in it, or let it. It would be wrong to\nlet it stand idle.\"\n\n\"But you need not decide quite at once.\"\n\n\"That's just what I want to do. I want to decide at once.\"\n\n\"Then I'm sure I cannot advise you. It seems to me very unlikely\nthat you should come and live here by yourself. It isn't like a\ncountry-house exactly.\"\n\n\"I shan't live there by myself certainly. You heard what Mrs.\nPartridge said just now.\"\n\n\"What did Mrs. Partridge say?\"\n\n\"She wanted to know whether it belonged to both of us, and whether it\nwas not all one. Shall it be all one, Clara?\"\n\nShe was leaning over the rail of the bridge as he spoke, with her\neyes fixed on the slowly moving water. When she heard his words,\nshe raised her face and looked full upon him. She was in some sort\nprepared for the moment, though it would be untrue to say that she\nhad now expected it. Unconsciously she had made some resolve that\nif ever the question were put to her by him, she would not be taken\naltogether off her guard; and now that the question was put to her,\nshe was able to maintain her composure. Her first feeling was one\nof triumph,--as it must be in such a position to any woman who has\nalready acknowledged to herself that she loves the man who then asks\nher to be his wife. She looked up into Captain Aylmer's face, and his\neye almost quailed beneath hers. Even should he be triumphant, he was\nnot perfectly assured that his triumph would be a success.\n\n\"Shall what be all one?\" she asked.\n\n\"Shall it be your house and my house? Can you tell me that you will\nlove me and be my wife?\" Again she looked at him, and he repeated his\nquestion. \"Clara, can you love me well enough to take me for your\nhusband?\"\n\n\"I can,\" she said. Why should she hesitate, and play the coy girl,\nand pretend to any doubts in her mind which did not exist there?\nShe did love him, and had so told herself with much earnestness. To\nhim, while his words had been doubtful,--while he had simply played\nat making love to her, she had given no hint of the state of her\naffections. She had so carried herself before him as to make him\ndoubt whether success could be possible for him. But now,--why should\nshe hesitate now? It was as she had hoped,--or as she had hardly\ndared to hope. He did love her. \"I can,\" she said; and then, before\nhe could speak again, she repeated her words with more emphasis.\n\"Indeed I can; with all my heart.\"\n\nAs regarded herself, she was quite equal to the occasion; but had she\nknown more of the inner feelings of men and women in general, she\nwould have been slower to show her own. What is there that any man\ndesires,--any man or any woman,--that does not lose half its value\nwhen it is found to be easy of access and easy of possession? Wine is\nvalued by its price, not its flavour. Open your doors freely to Jones\nand Smith, and Jones and Smith will not care to enter them. Shut your\ndoors obdurately against the same gentlemen, and they will use all\ntheir little diplomacy to effect an entrance. Captain Aylmer, when he\nheard the hearty tone of the girl's answer, already began almost to\ndoubt whether it was wise on his part to devote the innermost bin of\nhis cellar to wine that was so cheap.\n\nNot that he had any idea of receding. Principle, if not love,\nprevented that. \"Then the question about the house is decided,\" he\nsaid, giving his hand to Clara as he spoke.\n\n\"I don't care a bit about the house now,\" she answered.\n\n\"That's unkind.\"\n\n\"I am thinking so much more of you,--of you and of myself. What does\nan old house matter?\"\n\n\"It's in very good repair,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"You must not laugh at me,\" she said; and in truth he was not\nlaughing at her. \"What I mean is that anything about a house is\nindifferent to me now. It is as though I had got all that I want in\nthe world. Is it wrong of me to say so?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no;--not wrong at all. How can it be wrong?\" He did\nnot tell her that he also had got all he wanted; but his lack\nof enthusiasm in this respect did not surprise her, or at first\neven vex her. She had always known him to be a man careful of his\nwords,--knowing their value,--not speaking with hurried rashness as\nwould her dear cousin Will. And she doubted whether, after all, such\nhurried words mean as much as words which are slower and calmer.\nAfter all his heat in love and consequent disappointment, Will\nBelton had left her apparently well contented. His fervour had been\nshort-lived. She loved her cousin dearly, and was so very glad that\nhis fervour had been short-lived!\n\n\"When you asked me, I could but tell you the truth,\" she said,\nsmiling at him.\n\nThe truth is very well, but he would have liked it better had the\ntruth come to him by slower degrees. When his aunt had told him to\nmarry Clara Amedroz, he had been at once reconciled to the order by a\nfeeling on his own part that the conquest of Clara would not be too\nfacile. She was a woman of value, not to be snapped up easily,--or by\nany one. So he had thought then; but he began to fancy now that he\nhad been wrong in that opinion.\n\nThe walk back to the house was not of itself very exciting, though\nto Clara it was a short period of unalloyed bliss. No doubt had then\ncome upon her to cloud her happiness, and she was \"wrapped up in\nmeasureless content.\" It was well that they should both be silent\nat such a moment. Only yesterday had been buried their dear old\nfriend,--the friend who had brought them together, and been so\nanxious for their future happiness! And Clara Amedroz was not a young\ngirl, prone to jump out of her shoes with elation because she had got\na lover. She could be steadily happy without many immediate words\nabout her happiness. When they had reached the house, and were once\nmore together in the drawing-room, she again gave him her hand, and\nwas the first to speak. \"And you; are you contented?\" she asked. Who\ndoes not know the smile of triumph with which a girl asks such a\nquestion at such a moment as that?\n\n\"Contented?--well,--yes; I think I am,\" he said.\n\nBut even those words did not move her to doubt. \"If you are,\" she\nsaid, \"I am. And now I will leave you till dinner, that you may think\nover what you have done.\"\n\n\"I had thought about it before, you know,\" he replied. Then he\nstooped over her and kissed her. It was the first time he had done\nso; but his kiss was as cold and proper as though they had been man\nand wife for years! But it sufficed for her, and she went to her room\nas happy as a queen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nMISS AMEDROZ IS TOO CANDID BY HALF.\n\n\nClara, when she left her accepted lover in the drawing-room and went\nup to her own chamber, had two hours for consideration before she\nwould see him again;--and she had two hours for enjoyment. She was\nvery happy. She thoroughly believed in the man who was to be her\nhusband, feeling confident that he possessed those qualities which\nshe thought to be most necessary for her married happiness. She had\nquizzed him at times, pretending to make it matter of accusation\nagainst him that his life was not in truth all that his aunt believed\nit to be;--but had it been more what Mrs. Winterfield would have\nwished, it would have been less to Clara's taste. She liked his\nposition in the world; she liked the feeling that he was a man of\ninfluence; perhaps she liked to think that to some extent he was a\nman of fashion. He was not handsome, but he looked always like a\ngentleman. He was well educated, given to reading, prudent, steady\nin his habits, a man likely to rise in the world; and she loved him.\nI fear the reader by this time may have begun to think that her love\nshould never have been given to such a man. To this accusation I will\nmake no plea at present, but I will ask the complainant whether such\nmen are not always loved. Much is said of the rashness of women in\ngiving away their hearts wildly; but the charge when made generally\nis, I think, an unjust one. I am more often astonished by the\nprudence of girls than by their recklessness. A woman of thirty will\noften love well and not wisely; but the girls of twenty seem to\nme to like propriety of demeanour, decency of outward life, and a\ncompetence. It is, of course, good that it should be so; but if it\nis so, they should not also claim a general character for generous\nand passionate indiscretion, asserting as their motto that Love shall\nstill be Lord of All. Clara was more than twenty; but she was not\nyet so far advanced in age as to have lost her taste for decency of\ndemeanour and propriety of life. A Member of Parliament, with a small\nhouse near Eaton Square, with a moderate income, and a liking for\ncommittees, who would write a pamphlet once every two years, and\nread Dante critically during the recess, was, to her, the model for\na husband. For such a one she would read his blue books, copy his\npamphlets, and learn his translations by heart. She would be safe in\nthe hands of such a man, and would know nothing of the miseries which\nher brother had encountered. Her model may not appear, when thus\ndescribed, to be a very noble one; but I think it is the model most\napproved among ladies of her class in England.\n\nShe made up her mind on various points during those two hours of\nsolitude. In the first place, she would of course keep her purpose of\nreturning home on the following day. It was not probable that Captain\nAylmer would ask her to change it; but let him ask ever so much it\nmust not be changed. She must at once have the pleasure of telling\nher father that all his trouble about her would now be over; and\nthen, there was the consideration that her further sojourn in the\nhouse, with Captain Aylmer as her lover, would hardly be more proper\nthan it would have been had he not occupied that position. And what\nwas she to say if he pressed her as to the time of their marriage?\nHer aunt's death would of course be a sufficient reason why it should\nbe delayed for some few months; and, upon the whole, she thought it\nwould be best to postpone it till the next session of Parliament\nshould have nearly expired. But she would be prepared to yield to\nCaptain Aylmer, should he name any time after Easter. It was clearly\nhis intention to keep up the house in Perivale as his country\nresidence. She did not like Perivale or the house, but she would\nsay nothing against such an arrangement. Indeed, with what face\ncould she do so? She was going to bring nothing to the common\naccount,--absolutely nothing but herself! As she thought of this her\nlove grew warmer, and she hardly knew how sufficiently to testify to\nherself her own gratitude and affection.\n\nShe became conscious, as she was preparing herself for dinner, of\nsome special attention to her toilet. She was more than ordinarily\ncareful with her hair, and felt herself to be aware of an anxiety to\nlook her best. She had now been for some time so accustomed to dress\nherself in black, that in that respect her aunt's death had made no\ndifference to her. Deep mourning had ceased from habit to impress her\nwith any special feeling of funereal solemnity. But something about\nherself, or in the room, at last struck her with awe, bidding her\nremember how death had of late been busy among those who had been her\ndearest and nearest friends; and she sat down, almost frightened at\nher own heartlessness, in that she was allowing herself to be happy\nat such a time. Her aunt had been carried away to her grave only\nyesterday, and her brother's death had occurred under circumstances\nof peculiar distress within the year;--and yet she was happy,\ntriumphant,--almost lost in the joy of her own position! She remained\nfor a while in her chair, with her black dress hanging across her\nlap, as she argued with herself as to her own state of mind. Was it\na sign of a hard heart within her, that she could be happy at such\na time? Ought the memory of her poor brother to have such an effect\nupon her as to make any joy of spirits impossible to her? Should she\nat the present moment be so crushed by her aunt's demise, as to be\nincapable of congratulating herself upon her own success? Should\nshe have told him, when he asked her that question upon the bridge,\nthat there could be no marrying or giving in marriage between them,\nno talking on such a subject in days so full of sorrow as these?\nI do not know that she quite succeeded in recognising it as a\ntruth that sorrow should be allowed to bar out no joy that it does\nnot bar out of absolute necessity,--by its own weight, without\nreference to conventional ideas; that sorrow should never, under any\ncircumstances, be nursed into activity, as though it were a thing in\nitself divine or praiseworthy. I do not know that she followed out\nher arguments till she had taught herself that it is the Love that is\ndivine,--the Love which, when outraged by death or other severance,\nproduces that sorrow which man would control if he were strong\nenough, but which he cannot control by reason of the weakness of\nhis humanity. I doubt whether so much as this made itself plain\nto her, as she sat there before her toilet table, with her sombre\ndress hanging from her hands on to the ground. But something of the\nstrength of such reasoning was hers. Knowing herself to be full of\njoy, she would not struggle to make herself believe that it behoved\nher to be unhappy. She told herself that she was doing what was good\nfor others as well as for herself;--what would be very good for her\nfather, and what should be good, if it might be within her power to\nmake it so, for him who was to be her husband. The blackness of the\ncloud of her brother's death would never altogether pass away from\nher. It had tended, as she knew well, to make her serious, grave, and\nold, in spite of her own efforts to the contrary. The cloud had been\nso black with her that it had nearly lost for her the prize which was\nnow her own. But she told herself that that blackness was an injury\nto her, and not a benefit, and that it had now become a duty to\nher,--for his sake, if not for her own,--to dispel its shadows rather\nthan encourage them. She would go down to him full of joy, though not\nfull of mirth, and would confess to him frankly, that in receiving\nthe assurance of his love, she had received everything that had\nseemed to have any value for her in the world. Hitherto she had been\nindependent;--she had specially been careful to show to him her\nresolve to be independent of him. Now she would put aside all that,\nand let him know that she recognised in him her lord and master as\nwell as husband. To her father had been left no strength on which\nshe could lean, and she had been forced therefore to trust to her\nown strength. Now she would be dependent on him who was to be her\nhusband. As heretofore she had rejected his offers of assistance\nalmost with disdain, so now would she accept them without scruple,\nlooking to him to be her guide in all things, putting from her that\ncarping spirit in which she had been wont to judge of his actions,\nand believing in him,--as a wife should believe in her husband.\n\nSuch were the resolutions which Clara made in the first hour of\nsolitude which came to her after her engagement; and they would\nhave been wise resolutions but for this flaw--that the stronger was\nsubmitting itself to the weaker, the greater to the less, the more\nhonest to the less honest, that which was nearly true to that which\nwas in great part false. The theory of man and wife--that special\ntheory in accordance with which the wife is to bend herself in loving\nsubmission before her husband, is very beautiful; and would be good\naltogether if it could only be arranged that the husband should be\nthe stronger and the greater of the two. The theory is based upon\nthat hypothesis;--and the hypothesis sometimes fails of confirmation.\nIn ordinary marriages the vessel rights itself, and the stronger and\nthe greater takes the lead, whether clothed in petticoats, or in\ncoat, waistcoat, and trousers; but there sometimes comes a terrible\nshipwreck, when the woman before marriage has filled herself full\nwith ideas of submission, and then finds that her golden-headed god\nhas got an iron body and feet of clay.\n\nCaptain Aylmer when he was left alone had also something to think\nabout; and as there were two hours left for such thought before he\nwould again meet Clara, and as he had nothing else with which to\noccupy himself during those two hours, he again strolled down to\nthe bridge on which he had made his offer. He strolled down there,\nthinking that he was thinking, but hardly giving much mind to his\nthoughts, which he allowed to run away with themselves as they\nlisted. Of course he was going to be married. That was a thing\nsettled. And he was perfectly satisfied with himself in that he had\ndone nothing in a hurry, and could accuse himself of no folly even if\nhe had no great cause for triumph. He had been long thinking that he\nshould like to have Clara Amedroz for his wife;--long thinking that\nhe would ask her to marry him; and having for months indulged such\nthoughts he could not take blame to himself for having made to his\naunt that deathbed promise which she had exacted. At the moment in\nwhich she asked him the question he was himself anxious to do the\nthing she desired of him. How then could he have refused her? And,\nhaving given the promise, it was a matter of course with him to\nfulfil it. He was a man who would have never respected himself\nagain--would have hated himself for ever, had he failed to keep a\npromise from which no living being could absolve him. He had been\nright therefore to make the promise, and having made it, had been\nright to keep it, and to do the thing at once. And Clara was very\ngood and very wise, and sometimes looked very well, and would never\ndisgrace him; and as she was in worldly matters to receive much and\ngive nothing, she would probably be willing to make herself amenable\nto any arrangements as to their future mode of life which he might\npropose. In respect of this matter he was probably thinking of\nlodgings for himself in London during the parliamentary session,\nwhile she remained alone in the big red house upon which his eyes\nwere fixed at the time. There was much of convenience in all this,\nwhich might perhaps atone to him for the sacrifice which he was\nundoubtedly making of himself. Had marriage simply been of itself\na thing desirable, he could doubtless have disposed of himself\nto better advantage. His prospects, present fortune, and general\nposition were so favourable, that he might have dared to lift\nhis expectations, in regard both to wealth and rank, very high.\nThe Aylmers were a considerable people, and he, though a younger\nbrother, had much more than a younger brother's portion. His seat\nin Parliament was safe; his position in society was excellent and\nsecure; he was exactly so placed that marriage with a fortune was\nthe only thing wanting to put the finishing coping-stone to his\nedifice;--that, and perhaps also the useful glory of having some\nLady Mary or Lady Emily at the top of his table. Lady Emily Aylmer?\nYes;--it would have sounded better, and there was a certain Lady\nEmily who might have suited. Now, as some slight regrets stole upon\nhim gently, he failed to remember that this Lady Emily had not a\nshilling in the world.\n\nYes; some faint regrets did steal upon him, though he went on telling\nhimself that he had acted rightly. His stars, which were generally\nvery good to him, had not perhaps on this occasion been as good as\nusual. No doubt he had to a certain degree become encumbered with\nClara Amedroz. Had not the direct and immediate leap with which she\nhad come into his arms shown him somewhat too plainly that one word\nof his mouth tending towards matrimony had been regarded by her as\nbeing too valuable to be lost? The fruit that falls easily from the\ntree, though it is ever the best, is never valued by the gardener.\nLet him have well-nigh broken his neck in gathering it, unripe and\ncrude, from the small topmost boughs of the branching tree, and the\npippin will be esteemed by him as invaluable. On that morning, as\nCaptain Aylmer had walked home from church, he had doubted much what\nwould be Clara's answer to him. Then the pippin was at the end of\nthe dangerous bough. Now it had fallen to his feet, and he did not\nscruple to tell himself that it was his, and always might have been\nhis as a matter of course. Well, the apple had come of a good kind,\nand, though there might be specks upon it, though it might not be fit\nfor any special glory of show or pride of place among the dessert\nservice, still it should be garnered and used, and no doubt would be\na very good apple for eating. Having so concluded, Captain Aylmer\nreturned to the house, washed his hands, changed his boots, and went\ndown to the drawing-room just as dinner was ready. She came up to him\nalmost radiant with joy, and put her hand upon his arm. \"Martha did\nnot know but what you were here,\" she said, \"and told them to put\ndinner on the table.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not kept you waiting.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no. And what if you did? Ladies never care about things\ngetting cold. It is gentlemen only who have feelings in such matters\nas that.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there is much difference; but, however--\" Then\nthey were in the dining-room, and as the servant remained there\nduring dinner, there was nothing in their conversation worth\nrepeating. After dinner they still remained down stairs, seating\nthemselves on the two sides of the fire, Clara having fully resolved\nthat she would not on such an evening as this leave Captain Aylmer to\ndrink his glass of port wine by himself.\n\n\"I suppose I may stay with you, mayn't I?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes; I'm sure I'm very much obliged. I'm not at all wedded\nto solitude.\" Then there was a slight pause.\n\n\"That's lucky,\" she said, \"as you have made up your mind to be wedded\nin another sort of way.\" Her voice as she spoke was very low, but\nthere was a gentle ring of restrained joyousness in it which ought to\nhave gone at once to his heart and made him supremely blessed for the\ntime.\n\n\"Well,--yes,\" he answered. \"We are in for it now, both of us;--are we\nnot? I hope you have no misgivings about it, Clara.\"\n\n\"Who? I? I have misgivings! No, indeed. I have no misgivings,\nFrederic; no doubts, no scruples, no alloy in my happiness. With me\nit is all as I would have it be. Ah; you haven't understood why it\nhas been that I have seemed to be harsh to you when we have met.\"\n\n\"No, I have not,\" said he. This was true; but it is true also that it\nwould have been well that he should be kept in his ignorance. She was\nminded, however, to tell him everything, and therefore she went on.\n\n\"I don't know how to tell you; and yet, circumstanced as we are now,\nit seems that I ought to tell you everything.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; I think that,\" said Aylmer. He was one of those men\nwho consider themselves entitled to see, hear, and know every little\ndetail of a woman's conduct, as a consequence of the circumstances of\nhis engagement, and who consider themselves shorn of their privilege\nif anything be kept back. If any gentleman had said a soft word to\nClara eight years ago, that soft word ought to be repeated to him\nnow. I am afraid that these particular gentlemen sometimes hear\nsome fibs; and I often wonder that their own early passages in the\ntournays of love do not warn them that it must be so. When James has\nsat deliciously through all the moonlit night with his arm round\nMary's waist, and afterwards sees Mary led to the altar by John, does\nit not occur to him that some John may have also sat with his arm\nround Anna's waist,--that Anna whom he is leading to the altar? These\nthings should not be inquired into too curiously; but the curiosity\nof some men on such matters has no end. For the most part, women like\ntelling,--only they do not choose to be pressed beyond their own\nmodes of utterance. \"I should like to know that I have your full\nconfidence,\" said he.\n\n\"You have got my full confidence,\" she replied.\n\n\"I mean that you should tell me anything that there is to be told.\"\n\n\"It was only this, that I had learned to love you before I thought\nthat my love would be returned.\"\n\n\"Oh;--was that it?\" said Captain Aylmer, in a tone which seemed to\nimply something like disappointment.\n\n\"Yes, Fred; that was it. And how could I, under such circumstances,\ntrust myself to be gentle with you, or to look to you for assistance?\nHow could I guess then all that I know now?\"\n\n\"Of course you couldn't.\"\n\n\"And therefore I was driven to be harsh. My aunt used to speak to me\nabout it.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at that, for she was very anxious that we should be\nmarried.\"\n\nClara for a moment felt herself to be uncomfortable as she heard\nthese words, half perceiving that they implied some instigation on\nthe part of Mrs. Winterfield. Could it be that Captain Aylmer's offer\nhad been made in obedience to a promise? \"Did you know of her\nanxiety?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well;--yes; that is to say, I guessed it. It was natural enough that\nthe same idea should come to her and to me too. Of course, seeing us\nso much thrown together, she could not but think of our being married\nas a chance upon the cards.\"\n\n\"She used to tell me that I was harsh to you;--abrupt, she called it.\nBut what could I do? I'll tell you, Fred, how I first found out that\nI really cared for you. What I tell you now is of course a secret;\nand I should speak of it to no one under any circumstances but those\nwhich unite us two together. My cousin Will, when he was at Belton,\nmade me an offer.\"\n\n\"He did, did he? You did not tell me that when you were saying all\nthose fine things in his praise in the railway carriage.\"\n\n\"Of course I did not. Why should I? I wasn't bound to tell you my\nsecrets then, sir.\"\n\n\"But he did absolutely offer to you?\"\n\n\"Is there anything so wonderful in that? But, wonderful or not, he\ndid.\"\n\n\"And you refused him?\"\n\n\"I refused him certainly.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't have been a bad match, if all that you say about his\nproperty is true.\"\n\n\"If you come to that, it would have been a very good match; and\nperhaps you think I was silly to decline it?\"\n\n\"I don't say that.\"\n\n\"Papa thought so;--but, then, I couldn't tell papa the whole truth,\nas I can tell it to you now, Captain Aylmer. I couldn't tell dear\npapa that my heart was not my own to give to my cousin Will; nor\ncould I give Will any such reason. Poor Will! I could only say to him\nbluntly that I wouldn't have him.\"\n\n\"And you would, if it hadn't been,--hadn't been--for me.\"\n\n\"Nay, Fred; there you tax me too far. What might have come of my\nheart if you hadn't fallen in my way, who can say? I love Will Belton\ndearly, and hope that you may do so--\"\n\n\"I must see him first.\"\n\n\"Of course;--but, as I was saying, I doubt whether, under any\ncircumstances, he would have been the man I should have chosen for a\nhusband. But as it was,--it was impossible. Now you know it all, and\nI think that I have been very frank with you.\"\n\n\"Oh! very frank.\" He would not take her little jokes, nor understand\nher little prettinesses. That he was a man not prone to joking she\nknew well, but still it went against the grain with her to find that\nhe was so very hard in his replies to her attempts.\n\nIt was not easy for Clara to carry on the conversation after this,\nso she proposed that they should go up-stairs into the drawing-room.\nSuch a change even as that would throw them into a different way of\ntalking, and prevent the necessity of any further immediate allusion\nto Will Belton. For Clara was aware, though she hardly knew why, that\nher frankness to her future husband had hardly been successful, and\nshe regretted that she had on this occasion mentioned her cousin's\nname. They went up-stairs and again sat themselves in chairs over\nthe fire; but for a while conversation did not seem to come to them\nfreely. Clara felt that it was now Captain Aylmer's turn to begin,\nand Captain Aylmer felt--that he wished he could read the newspaper.\nHe had nothing in particular that he desired to say to his lady-love.\nThat morning, as he was shaving himself, he had something to say that\nwas very particular,--as to which he was at that moment so nervous,\nthat he had cut himself slightly through the trembling of his hand.\nBut that had now been said, and he was nervous no longer. That had\nnow been said, and the thing settled so easily, that he wondered at\nhis own nervousness. He did not know that there was anything that\nrequired much further immediate speech. Clara had thought somewhat\nof the time which might be proposed for their marriage, making some\nlittle resolves, with which the reader is already acquainted; but no\nideas of this kind presented themselves to Captain Aylmer. He had\nasked his cousin to be his wife, thereby making good his promise to\nhis aunt. There could be no further necessity for pressing haste.\nSufficient for the day is the evil thereof.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that the thriving lover actually spoke to\nhimself in such language as that,--or that he confessed to himself\nthat Clara Amedroz was an evil to him rather than a blessing. But\nhis feelings were already so far tending in that direction, that he\nwas by no means disposed to make any further promise, or to engage\nhimself in closer connection with matrimony by the mention of any\nspecial day. Clara, finding that her companion would not talk without\nencouragement from her, had to begin again, and asked all those\nnatural questions about his family, his brother, his sister, his home\nhabits, and the old house in Yorkshire, the answers to which must\nbe so full of interest to her. But even on these subjects he was\ndry, and indisposed to answer with the full copiousness of free\ncommunication which she desired. And at last there came a question\nand an answer,--a word or two on one side, and then a word or two on\nthe other, from which Clara got a wound which was very sore to her.\n\n\"I have always pictured to myself,\" she said, \"your mother as a woman\nwho has been very handsome.\"\n\n\"She is still a handsome woman, though she is over sixty.\"\n\n\"Tall, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, tall, and with something of--of--what shall I say--dignity,\nabout her.\"\n\n\"She is not grand, I hope?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you call grand.\"\n\n\"Not grand in a bad sense;--I'm sure she is not that. But there are\nsome ladies who seem to stand so high above the level of ordinary\nfemales as to make us who are ordinary quite afraid of them.\"\n\n\"My mother is certainly not ordinary,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"And I am,\" said Clara, laughing. \"I wonder what she'll say to\nme,--or, rather, what she will think of me.\" Then there was a\nmoment's silence, after which Clara, still laughing, went on. \"I see,\nFred, that you have not a word of encouragement to give me about your\nmother.\"\n\n\"She is rather particular,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\nThen Clara drew herself up, and ceased to laugh. She had called\nherself ordinary with that half-insincere depreciation of self which\nis common to all of us when we speak of our own attributes, but which\nwe by no means intend that they who hear us shall accept as strictly\ntrue, or shall re-echo as their own approved opinions. But in this\ninstance Captain Aylmer, though he had not quite done that, had done\nalmost as bad.\n\n\"Then I suppose I had better keep out of her way,\" said Clara, by no\nmeans laughing as she spoke.\n\n\"Of course when we are married you must go and see her.\"\n\n\"You do not, at any rate, promise me a very agreeable visit, Fred.\nBut I dare say I shall survive it. After all, it is you that I am to\nmarry, and not your mother; and as long as you are not majestic to\nme, I need not care for her majesty.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by majesty.\"\n\n\"You must confess that you speak of her as of something very\nterrible.\"\n\n\"I say that she is particular;--and so she is. And as my respect for\nher opinion is equal to my affection for her person, I hope that you\nwill make a great effort to gain her esteem.\"\n\n\"I never make any efforts of that kind. If esteem doesn't come\nwithout efforts it isn't worth having.\"\n\n\"There I disagree with you altogether;--but I especially disagree\nwith you as you are speaking about my mother, and about a lady who\nis to become your own mother-in-law. I trust that you will make such\nefforts, and that you will make them successfully. Lady Aylmer is not\na woman who will give you her heart at once, simply because you have\nbecome her son's wife. She will judge you by your own qualities, and\nwill not scruple to condemn you should she see cause.\"\n\nThen there was a longer silence, and Clara's heart was almost in\nrebellion even on this, the first day of her engagement. But she\nquelled her high spirit, and said no further word about Lady Aylmer.\nNor did she speak again till she had enabled herself to smile as she\nspoke.\n\n\"Well, Fred,\" she said, putting her hand upon his arm, \"I'll do my\nbest, and woman can do no more. And now I'll say good night, for I\nmust pack for to-morrow's journey before I go to bed.\" Then he kissed\nher,--with a cold, chilling kiss,--and she left him for the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nMISS AMEDROZ RETURNS HOME.\n\n\nClara was to start by a train leaving Perivale at eight on the\nfollowing morning, and therefore there was not much time for\nconversation before she went. During the night she had endeavoured so\nto school herself as to banish from her breast all feelings of anger\nagainst her lover, and of regret as regarded herself. Probably, as\nshe told herself, she had made more of what he had said than he had\nintended that she should do; and then, was it not natural that he\nshould think much of his mother, and feel anxious as to the way in\nwhich she might receive his wife? As to that feeling of anger on her\nown part, she did get quit of it;--but the regret was not to be so\neasily removed. It was not only what Captain Aylmer had said about\nhis mother that clung to her, doing much to quench her joy; but there\nhad been a coldness in his tone to her throughout the evening which\nshe recognised almost unconsciously, and which made her heart heavy\nin spite of the joy which she repeatedly told herself ought to be her\nown. And she also felt,--though she was not clearly aware that she\ndid so,--that his manner towards her had become less affectionate,\nless like that of a lover, since the honest tale she had told him of\nher own early love for him. She should have been less honest, and\nmore discreet; less bold, and more like in her words to the ordinary\nrun of women. She had known this as she was packing last night, and\nshe told herself that it was so as she was dressing on this her last\nmorning at Perivale. That frankness of hers had not been successful,\nand she regretted that she had not imposed on herself some little\nreticence,--or even a little of that coy pretence of indifference\nwhich is so often used by ladies when they are wooed. She had been\nboldly honest, and had found her honesty to be bad policy. She\nthought, at least, that she had found its policy to be bad. Whether\nin truth it may not have been very good,--have been the best policy\nin the world,--tending to give her the first true intimation which\nshe had ever yet received of the real character of the man who was\nnow so much to her,--that is altogether another question.\n\nBut it was clearly her duty to make the best of her present\ncircumstances, and she went down-stairs with a smiling face and with\npleasant words on her tongue. When she entered the breakfast-room\nCaptain Aylmer was there; but Martha was there also, and her pleasant\nwords were received indifferently in the presence of the servant.\nWhen the old woman was gone, Captain Aylmer assumed a grave face, and\nbegan a serious little speech which he had prepared. But he broke\ndown in the utterance of it, and was saying things very different\nfrom what he had intended before he had completed it.\n\n\"Clara,\" he began, \"what occurred between us yesterday is a source of\ngreat satisfaction to me.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, Frederic,\" said she, trying to be a little less\nserious than her lover.\n\n\"Of very great satisfaction,\" he continued; \"and I cannot but think\nthat we were justified by the circumstances of our position in\nforgetting for a time the sad solemnity of the occasion. When I\nremember that it was but the day before yesterday that I followed my\ndear old aunt to the grave, I am astonished to think that yesterday I\nshould have made an offer of marriage.\"\n\nWhat could be the good of his talking in this strain? Clara, too,\nhad had her own misgivings on the same subject,--little qualms of\nconscience that had come to her as she remembered her old friend\nin the silent watches of the night; but such thoughts were for the\nsilent watches, and not for open expression in the broad daylight.\nBut he had paused, and she must say something.\n\n\"One's excuse to oneself is this,--that she would have wished it so.\"\n\n\"Exactly. She would have wished it. Indeed she did wish it, and\ntherefore--\" He paused in what he was saying, and felt himself to be\non difficult ground. Her eye was full upon him, and she waited for a\nmoment or two as though expecting that he would finish his words. But\nas he did not go on, she finished them for him.\n\n\"And therefore you sacrificed your own feelings.\" Her heart was\nbecoming sore, and she was unable to restrain the utterance of her\nsarcasm.\n\n\"Just so,\" said he; \"or, rather, not exactly that. I don't mean that\nI am sacrificed; for, of course, as I have just now said, nothing as\nregards myself can be more satisfactory. But yesterday should have\nbeen a solemn day to us; and as it was not--\"\n\n\"I thought it very solemn.\"\n\n\"What I mean is that I find an excuse in remembering that I was doing\nwhat she asked me to do.\"\n\n\"What she asked you to do, Fred?\"\n\n\"What I had promised, I mean.\"\n\n\"What you had promised? I did not hear that before.\" These last words\nwere spoken in a very low voice, but they went direct to Captain\nAylmer's ears.\n\n\"But you have heard me declare,\" he said, \"that as regards myself\nnothing could be more satisfactory.\"\n\n\"Fred,\" she said, \"listen to me for a moment. You and I engaged\nourselves to each other yesterday as man and wife.\"\n\n\"Of course we did.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, dear Fred. In doing that there was nothing in my mind\nunbefitting the sadness of the day. Even in death we must think of\nlife, and if it were well for you and me that we should be together,\nit would surely have been but a foolish ceremony between us to have\nabstained from telling each other that it would be so because my aunt\nhad died last week. But it may be, and I think it is the case, that\nthe feelings arising from her death have made us both too\nprecipitate.\"\n\n\"I don't understand how that can be.\"\n\n\"You have been anxious to keep a promise made to her, without\nconsidering sufficiently whether in doing so you would secure your\nown happiness; and I--\"\n\n\"I don't know about you, but as regards myself I must be considered\nto be the best judge.\"\n\n\"And I have been too much in a hurry in believing that which I wished\nto believe.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by all this, Clara?\"\n\n\"I mean that our engagement shall be at an end;--not necessarily so\nfor always. But that as an engagement binding us both, it shall for\nthe present cease to exist. You shall be again free--\"\n\n\"But I don't choose to be free.\"\n\n\"When you think of it you will find it best that it should be so. You\nhave performed your promise honestly, even though at a sacrifice to\nyourself. Luckily for you,--for both of us, I should say,--the full\ntruth has come out; and we can consider quietly what will be best for\nus to do, independently of that promise. We will part, therefore, as\ndear friends, but not as engaged to each other as man and wife.\"\n\n\"But we are engaged, and I will not hear of its being broken.\"\n\n\"A lady's word, Fred, is always the most potential before\nmarriage;--and you must therefore yield to me in this matter. I am\nsure your judgment will approve of my decision when you think of it.\nThere shall be no engagement between us. I shall consider myself\nquite free,--free to do as I please altogether; and you, of course,\nwill be free also.\"\n\n\"If you please, of course it must be so.\"\n\n\"I do please, Fred.\"\n\n\"And yesterday, then, is to go for nothing.\"\n\n\"Not exactly. It cannot go for nothing with me. I told you too many\nof my secrets for that. But nothing that was done or said yesterday\nis to be held as binding upon either of us.\"\n\n\"And you made up your mind to that last night?\"\n\n\"It is at any rate made up to that now. Come,--I shall have to go\nwithout my breakfast if I do not eat it at once. Will you have your\ntea now, or wait and take it comfortably when I am gone?\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer breakfasted with her, and took her to the station, and\nsaw her off with all possible courtesy and attention, and then he\nwalked back by himself to his own great house in Perivale. Not a word\nmore had been said between him and Clara as to their engagement, and\nhe recognised it as a fact that he was no longer bound to her as her\nfuture husband. Indeed, he had no power of not recognising the fact,\nso decided had been her language, and so imperious her manner. It had\nbeen of no avail that he had said that the engagement should stand.\nShe had told him that her voice was to be the more potential, and he\nhad felt that it was so. Well;--might it not be best for him that it\nshould be so? He had kept his promise to his aunt, and had done all\nthat lay in his power to make Clara Amedroz his wife. If she chose to\nrebel against her own good fortune simply because he spoke to her a\nfew words which seemed to him to be fitting, might it not be well for\nhim to take her at her word?\n\nSuch were his first thoughts; but as the day wore on with him,\nsomething more generous in his nature came to his aid, and something\nalso that was akin to real love. Now that she was no longer his own,\nhe again felt a desire to have her. Now that there would be again\nsomething to be done in winning her, he was again stirred by a man's\ndesire to do that something. He ought not to have told her of the\npromise. He was aware that what he had said on that point had been\ndropped by him accidentally, and that Clara's resolution after that\nhad not been unnatural. He would, therefore, give her another chance,\nand resolved before he went to bed that night that he would allow a\nfortnight to pass away, and would then write to her, renewing his\noffer with all the strongest declarations of affection which he would\nbe enabled to make.\n\nClara on her way home was not well satisfied with herself or with her\nposition. She had had great joy, during the few hours of joy which\nhad been hers, in thinking of the comfort which her news would give\nto her father. He would be released from all further trouble on her\naccount by the tidings which she would convey to him,--by the tidings\nwhich she had intended to convey to him. But now the story which she\nwould have to tell would by no means be comfortable. She would have\nto explain to him that her aunt had left no provision for her, and\nthat would be the beginning and the end of her story. As for those\nconversations about the fifteen hundred pounds,--of them she would\nsay nothing. When she reflected on what had taken place between\nherself and Captain Aylmer she was more resolved than ever that she\nwould not touch any portion of that money,--or of any money that\nshould come from him. Nor would she tell her father anything of the\nmarriage engagement which had been made on one day and unmade on the\nnext. Why should she add to his distress by showing him what good\nthings might have been hers had she only had the wit to keep them?\nNo;--she would tell her father simply of the will, and then comfort\nhim in his affliction as best she might.\n\nAs regarded her position with Captain Aylmer, the more she thought of\nit the more sure she became that everything was over in that quarter.\nShe had, indeed, told him that such need not necessarily be the\ncase,--but this she had done in her desire at the moment to mitigate\nthe apparent authoritativeness of her own decision, rather than with\nany idea of leaving the matter open for further consideration. She\nwas sure that Captain Aylmer would be glad of a means of escape,\nand that he would not again place himself in the jeopardy which the\npromise exacted from him by his aunt had made so nearly fatal to him.\nAnd for herself, though she still loved the man,--so loved him that\nshe lay back in the corner of her carriage weeping behind her veil\nas she thought of what she had lost,--still she would not take him,\nthough he should again press his suit upon her with all the ardour\nat his command. No, indeed. No man should ever be made to regard her\nas a burden imposed upon him by an extorted promise! What;--let a\nman sacrifice himself to a sense of duty on her behalf! And then she\nrepeated the odious words to herself, till she came to think that it\nhad fallen from his lips and not from her own.\n\nIn writing to her father from Perivale, she had merely told him of\nMrs. Winterfield's death and of her own intended return. At the\nTaunton station she met the well-known old fly and the well-known\nold driver, and was taken home in the accustomed manner. As she\ndrew nearer to Belton the sense of her distress became stronger and\nstronger, till at last she almost feared to meet her father. What\ncould she say to him when he should repeat to her, as he would be\nsure to do, his lamentation as to her future poverty?\n\nOn arriving at the house she learned that he was up-stairs in his\nbedroom. He had been ill, the servant said, and though he was not now\nin bed, he had not come down-stairs. So she ran up to his room, and\nfinding him seated in an old arm-chair by the fire-side, knelt down\nat his feet, as she took his hand and asked him as to his health.\n\n\"What has Mrs. Winterfield done for you in her will?\" These were the\nfirst words he spoke to her.\n\n\"Never mind about wills now, papa. I want you to tell me of\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Clara. Answer my question.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, I wish you would not think so much about money for me.\"\n\n\"Not think about it? Why am I not to think about it? What else have I\ngot to think of? Tell me at once, Clara, what she has done. You ought\nto have written to me directly the will was made known.\"\n\nThere was no help for her, and the terrible word must be spoken. \"She\nhas left her property to Captain Aylmer, papa; and I must say that I\nthink she is right.\"\n\n\"You do not mean everything?\"\n\n\"She has provided for her servants.\"\n\n\"And has made no provision for you?\"\n\n\"No, papa.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that she has left you nothing,--absolutely\nnothing?\" The old man's manner was altogether altered as he asked\nthis question; and there came over his face so unusual a look of\nenergy,--of the energy of anger,--that Clara was frightened, and knew\nnot how to answer him with that tone of authority which she was\naccustomed to use when she found it necessary to exercise control\nover him. \"Do you mean to say that there is nothing,--nothing?\" And\nas he repeated the question he pushed her away from his knees and\nstood up with an effort, leaning against the back of his chair.\n\n\"Dear papa, do not let this distress you.\"\n\n\"But is it so? Is there in truth nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing, papa. Remember that she was not really my aunt.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, child;--nonsense! How can you talk such trash to me as\nthat? And then you tell me not to distress myself! I am to know\nthat you will be a beggar in a year or two,--probably in a few\nmonths,--and that is not to distress me! She has been a wicked\nwoman!\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, do not say that.\"\n\n\"A wicked woman. A very wicked woman. It is always so with those who\npretend to be more religious than their neighbours. She has been a\nvery wicked woman, alluring you into her house with false hopes.\"\n\n\"No, papa;--no; I must contradict you. She had given me no ground for\nsuch hope.\"\n\n\"I say she had,--even though she may not have made a promise. I say\nshe had. Did not everybody think that you were to have her money?\"\n\n\"I don't know what people may have thought. Nobody has had any right\nto think about it at all.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense, Clara. You know that I expected it;--that you\nexpected it yourself.\"\n\n\"No;--no, no!\"\n\n\"Clara,--how can you tell me that?\"\n\n\"Papa, I knew that she intended to leave me nothing. She told me so\nwhen I was there in the spring.\"\n\n\"She told you so?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa. She told me that Frederic Aylmer was to have all her\nproperty. She explained to me everything that she meant to do, and I\nthought that she was right.\"\n\n\"And why was not I told when you came home?\"\n\n\"Dear papa!\"\n\n\"Dear papa, indeed. What is the meaning of dear papa? Why have I been\ndeceived?\"\n\n\"What good could I do by telling you? You could not change it.\"\n\n\"You have been very undutiful; and as for her, her wickedness and\ncruelty shock me,--shock me. They do, indeed. That she should have\nknown your position, and had you with her always,--and then have\nmade such a will as that! Quite heartless! She must have been quite\nheartless.\"\n\nClara now began to find that she must in justice to her aunt's memory\ntell her father something more. And yet it would be very difficult\nto tell him anything that would not bring greater affliction upon\nhim, and would not also lead her into deeper trouble. Should it come\nto pass that her aunt's intention with reference to the fifteen\nhundred pounds was mentioned, she would be subjected to an endless\npersecution as to the duty of accepting that money from Captain\nAylmer. But her present feelings would have made her much prefer\nto beg her bread upon the roads than accept her late lover's\ngenerosity. And then again, how could she explain to her father Mrs.\nWinterfield's mistake about her own position without seeming to\naccuse her father of having robbed her? But nevertheless she must\nsay something, as Mr. Amedroz continued to apply that epithet of\nheartless to Mrs. Winterfield, going on with it in a low droning\ntone, that was more injurious to Clara's ears than the first full\nenergy of his anger. \"Heartless,--quite heartless;--shockingly\nheartless,--shockingly heartless!\"\n\n\"The truth is, papa,\" Clara said at last, \"that when my aunt told\nme about her will, she did not know but what I had some adequate\nprovision from my own family.\"\n\n\"Oh, Clara!\"\n\n\"That is the truth, papa;--for she explained the whole thing to me.\nI could not tell her that she was mistaken, and thus ask for her\nmoney.\"\n\n\"But she knew everything about that poor wretched boy.\" And now the\nfather dropped back into his chair, and buried his face in his hands.\n\nWhen he did this Clara again knelt at his feet. She felt that she had\nbeen cruel, and that she had defended her aunt at the cost of her own\nfather. She had, as it were, thrown in his teeth his own imprudence,\nand twitted him with the injuries which he had done to her. \"Papa,\"\nshe said, \"dear papa, do not think about it at all. What is the use?\nAfter all, money is not everything. I care nothing for money. If you\nwill only agree to banish the subject altogether, we shall be so\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"How is it to be banished?\"\n\n\"At any rate we need not speak of it. Why should we talk on a subject\nwhich is simply uncomfortable, and which we cannot mend?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\" And now he swayed himself backwards and\nforwards in his chair, bewailing his own condition and hers, and his\npast imprudence, while the tears ran down his cheeks. She still knelt\nthere at his feet, looking up into his face with loving, beseeching\neyes, praying him to be comforted, and declaring that all would still\nbe well if he would only forget the subject, or, at any rate, cease\nto speak of it. But still he went on wailing, complaining of his lot\nas a child complains, and refusing all consolation. \"Yes; I know,\"\nsaid he, \"it has all been my fault. But how could I help it? What was\nI to do?\"\n\n\"Papa, nobody has said that anything was your fault; nobody has\nthought so.\"\n\n\"I never spent anything on myself--never, never; and yet,--and\nyet,--and yet--!\"\n\n\"Look at it with more courage, papa. After all, what harm will it be\nif I should have to go out and earn my own bread like any other young\nwoman? I am not afraid.\"\n\nAt last he wept himself into an apathetic tranquillity, as though he\nhad at present no further power for any of the energy of grief; and\nshe left him while she went about the house and learned how things\nhad gone on during her absence. It seemed, from the tidings which\nthe servant gave her, that he had been ill almost since she had been\ngone. He had, at any rate, chosen to take his meals in his own room,\nand as far as was remembered, had not once left the house since she\nhad been away. He had on two or three occasions spoken of Mr. Belton,\nappearing to be anxious for his coming, and asking questions as to\nthe cattle and the work that was still going on about the place; and\nClara, when she returned to his room, tried to interest him again\nabout her cousin. But he had in truth been too much distressed by the\nill news as to Mrs. Winterfield's will to be able to rally himself,\nand the evening that was spent up in his room was very comfortless\nto both of them. Clara had her own sorrows to bear as well as her\nfather's, and could take no pleasant look out into the world of her\nown circumstances. She had gained her lover merely to lose him,--and\nhad lost him under circumstances that were very painful to her\nwoman's feeling. Though he had been for one night betrothed to her as\nher husband, he had never loved her. He had asked her to be his wife\nsimply in fulfilment of a death-bed promise! The more she thought\nof it the more bitter did the idea of it become to her. And she\ncould not also but think of her cousin. Poor Will! He, at any rate,\nhad loved her, though his eagerness in love had been, as she told\nherself, but short-lived. As she thought of him, it seemed but the\nother day that he had been with her up on the rock in the park;--but\nas she thought of Captain Aylmer, to whom she had become engaged only\nyesterday, and from whom she had separated herself only that morning,\nshe felt that an eternity of time had passed since she had parted\nfrom him.\n\nOn the following day, a dull, dark, melancholy day, towards the end\nof November, she went out to saunter about the park, leaving her\nfather still in his bedroom, and after a while made her way down to\nthe cottage. She found Mrs. Askerton as usual alone in the little\ndrawing-room, sitting near the window with a book in her hand; but\nClara knew at once that her friend had not been reading,--that she\nhad been sitting there looking out upon the clouds, with her mind\nfixed upon things far away. The general cheerfulness of this woman\nhad often been cause of wonder to Clara, who knew how many of her\nhours were passed in solitude; but there did occasionally come upon\nher periods of melancholy in which she was unable to act up to the\nsettled rule of her life, and in which she would confess that the\ndays and weeks and months were too long for her.\n\n\"So you are back,\" said Mrs. Askerton, as soon as the first greeting\nwas over.\n\n\"Yes; I am back.\"\n\n\"I supposed you would not stay there long after the funeral.\"\n\n\"No; what good could I do?\"\n\n\"And Captain Aylmer is still there, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I left him at Perivale.\"\n\nThere was a slight pause, as Mrs. Askerton hesitated before she asked\nher next question. \"May I be told anything about the will?\" she said.\n\n\"The weary will! If you knew how I hated the subject you would not\nask me. But you must not think I hate it because it has given me\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Given you nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing! But that does not make me hate it. It is the nature of the\nsubject that is so odious. I have now told you all,--everything that\nthere is to be told, though we were to talk for a week. If you are\ngenerous you will not say another word about it.\"\n\n\"But I am so sorry.\"\n\n\"There,--that's it. You won't perceive that the expression of such\nsorrow is a personal injury to me. I don't want you to be sorry.\"\n\n\"How am I to help it?\"\n\n\"You need not express it. I don't come pitying you for supposed\ntroubles. You have plenty of money; but if you were so poor that you\ncould eat nothing but cold mutton, I shouldn't condole with you as to\nthe state of your larder. I should pretend to think that poultry and\npiecrust were plentiful with you.\"\n\n\"No, you wouldn't, dear;--not if I were as dear to you as you are to\nme.\"\n\n\"Well, then, be sorry; and let there be an end of it. Remember how\nmuch of all this I must of necessity have to go through with poor\npapa.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; I can believe that.\"\n\n\"And he is so far from well. Of course you have not seen him since\nI have been gone.\"\n\n\"No; we never see him unless he comes up to the gate there.\" Then\nthere was another pause for a moment. \"And what about Captain\nAylmer?\" asked Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"Well;--what about him?\"\n\n\"He is the heir now?\"\n\n\"Yes;--he is the heir.\"\n\n\"And that is all?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is all. What more should there be? The poor old house at\nPerivale will be shut up, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I don't care about the old house much, as it is not to be your\nhouse.\"\n\n\"No;--it is not to be my house certainly.\"\n\n\"There were two ways in which it might have become yours.\"\n\n\"Though there were ten ways, none of those ways have come my way,\"\nsaid Clara.\n\n\"Of course I know that you are so close that though there were\nanything to tell you would not tell it.\"\n\n\"I think I would tell you anything that was proper to be told; but\nnow there is nothing proper,--or improper.\"\n\n\"Was it proper or improper when Mr. Belton made an offer to you,--as\nI knew he would do, of course; as I told you that he would? Was that\nso improper that it could not be told?\"\n\nClara was aware that the tell-tale colour in her face at once took\nfrom her the possibility of even pretending that the allegation was\nuntrue, and that in any answer she might give she must acknowledge\nthe fact. \"I do not think,\" she said, \"that it is considered fair to\ngentlemen to tell such stories as that.\"\n\n\"Then I can only say that the young ladies I have known are generally\nvery unfair.\"\n\n\"But who told you?\"\n\n\"Who told me? My maid. Of course she got it from yours. Those things\nare always known.\"\n\n\"Poor Will!\"\n\n\"Poor Will, indeed. He is coming here again, I hear, almost\nimmediately, and it needn't be 'poor Will' unless you like it. But as\nfor me, I am not going to be an advocate in his favour. I tell you\nfairly that I did not like what little I saw of poor Will.\"\n\n\"I like him of all things.\"\n\n\"You should teach him to be a little more courteous in his demeanour\nto ladies; that is all. I will tell you something else, too, about\npoor Will--but not now. Some other day I will tell you something of\nyour cousin Will.\"\n\nClara did not care to ask any questions as to this something that was\nto be told, and therefore took her leave and went away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nMR. WILLIAM BELTON TAKES A WALK IN THE COUNTRY.\n\n\nClara Amedroz had made one great mistake about her cousin, Will\nBelton, when she came to the conclusion that she might accept his\nproffered friendship without any apprehension that the friend would\nbecome a lover; and she made another, equally great, when she\nconvinced herself that his love had been as short-lived as it had\nbeen eager. Throughout his journey back to Plaistow, he had thought\nof nothing else but his love, and had resolved to persevere, telling\nhimself sometimes that he might perhaps be successful, and feeling\nsure at other times that he would encounter renewed sorrow and\npermanent disappointment,--but equally resolved in either mood that\nhe would persevere. Not to persevere in pursuit of any desired\nobject,--let the object be what it might,--was, to his thinking,\nunmanly, weak, and destructive of self-respect. He would sometimes\nsay of himself, joking with other men, that if he did not succeed in\nthis or that thing, he could never speak to himself again. To no man\ndid he talk of his love in such a strain as this; but there was a\nwoman to whom he spoke of it; and though he could not joke on such a\nmatter, the purport of what he said showed the same feeling. To be\nfinally rejected, and to put up with such rejection, would make him\nalmost contemptible in his own eyes.\n\nThis woman was his sister, Mary Belton. Something has been already\nsaid of this lady, which the reader may perhaps remember. She was\na year or two older than her brother, with whom she always lived,\nbut she had none of those properties of youth which belonged to him\nin such abundance. She was, indeed, a poor cripple, unable to walk\nbeyond the limits of her own garden, feeble in health, dwarfed in\nstature, robbed of all the ordinary enjoyments of life by physical\ndeficiencies, which made even the task of living a burden to her. To\neat was a pain, or at best a trouble. Sleep would not comfort her in\nbed, and weariness during the day made it necessary that the hours\npassed in bed should be very long. She was one of those whose lot in\nlife drives us to marvel at the inequalities of human destiny, and to\ninquire curiously within ourselves whether future compensation is to\nbe given.\n\nIt is said of those who are small and crooked-backed in their bodies,\nthat their minds are equally cross-grained and their tempers as\nungainly as their stature. But no one had ever said this of Mary\nBelton. Her friends, indeed, were very few in number; but those who\nknew her well loved her as they knew her, and there were three or\nfour persons in the world who were ready at all times to swear that\nshe was faultless. It was the great happiness of her life that among\nthose three or four her own brother was the foremost. Will Belton's\nlove for his sister amounted almost to veneration, and his devotion\nto her was so great, that in all the affairs of his life he was\nprepared to make her comfort one of his first considerations. And\nshe, knowing this, had come to fear that she might be an embargo on\nhis prosperity, and a stumbling-block in the way of his success. It\nhad occurred to her that he would have married earlier in life if\nshe had not been, as it were, in his way; and she had threatened him\nplayfully,--for she could be playful,--that she would leave him if he\ndid not soon bring a mistress home to Plaistow Hall. \"I will go to\nuncle Robert,\" she had said. Now uncle Robert was the clergyman in\nLincolnshire of whom mention has been made, and he was among those\ntwo or three who believed in Mary Belton with an implicit faith,--as\nwas also his wife. \"I will go to uncle Robert, Will, and then you\nwill be driven to get a wife.\"\n\n\"If my sister ever leaves my house, whether there be a wife in it or\nnot,\" Will had answered, \"I will never put trust in any woman again.\"\n\nPlaistow Manor-house or Hall was a fine brick mansion, built in\nthe latter days of Tudor house architecture, with many gables and\ncountless high chimneys,--very picturesque to the eye, but not in\nall respects comfortable as are the modern houses of the well-to-do\nsquirearchy of England. And, indeed, it was subject to certain\nobjectionable characteristics which in some degree justified the\nscorn which Mr. Amedroz intended to throw upon it when he declared\nit to be a farmhouse. The gardens belonging to it were large and\nexcellent; but they did not surround it, and allowed the farm\nappurtenances to come close up to it on two sides. The door which\nshould have been the front door, opening from the largest room in the\nhouse, which had been the hall and which was now the kitchen, led\ndirectly into the farmyard. From the further end of this farm-yard a\nmagnificent avenue of elms stretched across the home pasture down to\na hedge which crossed it at the bottom. That there had been a road\nthrough the rows of trees,--or, in other words, that there had in\ntruth been an avenue to the house on that side,--was, of course,\ncertain. But now there was no vestige of such road, and the front\nentrance to Plaistow Hall was by a little path across the garden from\na modern road which had been made to run cruelly near to the house.\nSuch was Plaistow Hall, and such was its mistress. Of the master, the\nreader, I hope, already knows so much as to need no further\ndescription.\n\nAs Belton drove himself home from the railway station late on that\nAugust night, he made up his mind that he would tell his sister all\nhis story about Clara Amedroz. She had ever wished that he should\nmarry, and now he had made his attempt. Little as had been her\nopportunity of learning the ways of men and women from experience in\nsociety, she had always seemed to him to know exactly what every one\nshould do in every position of life. And she would be tender with\nhim, giving him comfort even if she could not give him hope. Moreover\nMary might be trusted with his secret; for Belton felt, as men always\ndo feel, a great repugnance to have it supposed that his suit to a\nwoman had been rejected. Women, when they have loved in vain, often\nalmost wish that their misfortune should be known. They love to\ntalk about their wounds mystically,--telling their own tales under\nfeigned names, and extracting something of a bitter sweetness\nout of the sadness of their own romance. But a man, when he has\nbeen rejected,--rejected with a finality that is acknowledged by\nhimself,--is unwilling to speak or hear a word upon the subject,\nand would willingly wash the episode out from his heart if it were\npossible.\n\nBut not on that his first night would he begin to speak of Clara\nAmedroz. He would not let his sister believe that his heart was too\nfull of the subject to allow of his thinking of other matters. Mary\nwas still up, waiting for him when he arrived, with tea, and cream,\nand fruit ready for him. \"Oh, Mary!\" he said, \"why are you not in\nbed? You know that I would have come to you up-stairs.\" She excused\nherself, smiling, declaring that she could not deny herself the\npleasure of being with him for half an hour on his first return from\nhis travels. \"Of course I want to know what they are like,\" she said.\n\n\"He is a nice-looking old man,\" said Will, \"and she is a nice-looking\nyoung woman.\"\n\n\"That is graphic and short, at any rate.\"\n\n\"And he is weak and silly, but she is strong and--and--and--\"\n\n\"Not silly also, I hope?\"\n\n\"Anything but that. I should say she is very clever.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't like her, Will.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes; really.\"\n\n\"And did she take your coming well?\"\n\n\"Very well. I think she is much obliged to me for going.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Amedroz?\"\n\n\"He liked my coming too,--very much.\"\n\n\"What;--after that cold letter?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I shall explain it all by degrees. I have taken a lease\nof all the land, and I'm to go back at Christmas; and as to the old\ngentleman,--he'd have me live there altogether if I would.\"\n\n\"Why, Will?\"\n\n\"Is it not odd? I'm so glad I didn't make up my mind not to go when I\ngot that letter. And yet I don't know.\" These last words he added\nslowly, and in a low voice, and Mary at once knew that everything was\nnot quite as it ought to be.\n\n\"Is there anything wrong, Will?\"\n\n\"No, nothing wrong; that is to say, there is nothing to make me\nregret that I went. I think I did some good to them.\"\n\n\"It was to do good to them that you went there.\"\n\n\"They wanted to have some one near them who could be to them as one\nof their own family. He is too old,--too much worn out to be capable\nof managing things; and the people there were, of course, robbing\nhim. I think I have put a stop to that.\"\n\n\"And you are to go again at Christmas?\"\n\n\"Yes; they can do without me at my uncle's, and you will be there. I\nhave taken the land, and already bought some of the stock for it, and\nam going to buy more.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't lose money, Will.\"\n\n\"No;--not ultimately, that is. I shall get the place in good\ncondition, and I shall have paid myself when he goes, in that way,\nif in no other. Besides, what's a little money? I owe it to them for\nrobbing her of her inheritance.\"\n\n\"You do not rob her, Will.\"\n\n\"It is hard upon her, though.\"\n\n\"Does she feel it hard?\"\n\n\"Whatever may be her feelings on such a matter, she is a woman much\ntoo proud to show them.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew whether you liked her or not.\"\n\n\"I do like her,--I love her better than any one in the world; better\neven than you, Mary; for I have asked her to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Oh, Will!\"\n\n\"And she has refused me. Now you know the whole of it,--the whole\nhistory of what I have done while I have been away.\" And he stood\nup before her, with his thumbs thrust into the arm-holes of his\nwaistcoat, with something serious and almost solemn in his gait, in\nspite of a smile which played about his mouth.\n\n\"Oh, Will!\"\n\n\"I meant to have told you, of course, Mary,--to have told you\neverything; but I did not mean to tell it to-night; only it has\nsomehow fallen from me. Out of the full heart the mouth speaks, they\nsay.\"\n\n\"I never can like her if she refuses your love.\"\n\n\"Why not? That is unlike you, Mary. Why should she be bound to love\nme because I love her?\"\n\n\"Is there any one else, Will?\"\n\n\"How can I tell? I did not ask her. I would not have asked her for\nthe world, though I would have given the world to know.\"\n\n\"And she is so very beautiful?\"\n\n\"Beautiful! It isn't that so much;--though she is beautiful.\nBut,--but,--I can't tell you why,--but she is the only girl that\nI ever saw who would suit me for a wife. Oh, dear!\"\n\n\"My own Will!\"\n\n\"But I'm not going to keep you up all night, Mary. And I'll tell you\nsomething else; I'm not going to break my heart for love. And I'll\ntell you something else again; I'm not going to give it up yet. I\nbelieve I've been a fool. Indeed, I know I've been a fool. I went\nabout it just as if I were buying a horse, and had told the seller\nthat that was my price,--he might take it or leave it. What right had\nI to suppose that any girl was to be had in that way; much less such\na girl as Clara Amedroz?\"\n\n\"It would have been a great match for her.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that, Mary. Her education has been different from\nmine, and it may well be that she should marry above me. But I swear\nI will not speak another word to you to-night. To-morrow, if you're\nwell enough, I'll talk to you all day.\" Soon after that he did get\nher to go up to her room, though, of course, he broke that oath of\nhis as to not speaking another word. After that he walked out by\nmoonlight round the house, wandering about the garden and farmyard,\nand down through the avenue, having in his own mind some pretence of\nthe watchfulness of ownership, but thinking little of his property\nand much of his love. Here was a thing that he desired with all his\nheart, but it seemed to be out of his reach,--absolutely out of his\nreach. He was sick and weary with a feeling of longing,--sick with\nthat covetousness wherewith Ahab coveted the vineyard of Naboth. What\nwas the world to him if he could not have this thing on which he had\nset his heart? He had told his sister that he would not break his\nheart; and so much, he did not doubt, would be true. A man or woman\nwith a broken heart was in his estimation a man or woman who should\ndie of love; and he did not look for such a fate as that. But he\nexperienced the palpable misery of a craving emptiness within his\nbreast, and did believe of himself that he never could again be in\ncomfort unless he could succeed with Clara Amedroz. He stood leaning\nagainst one of the trees, striking his hands together, and angry with\nhimself at the weakness which had reduced him to such a state. What\ncould any man be worth who was so little master of himself as he had\nnow become?\n\nAfter awhile he made his way back through the farmyard, and in at the\nkitchen door, which he locked and bolted; and then, throwing himself\ndown into a wooden arm-chair which always stood there, in the corner\nof the huge hearth, he took a short pipe from the mantelpiece, filled\nit with tobacco, and lighting it almost unconsciously, began to smoke\nwith vehemence. Plaistow Hall was already odious to him, and he\nlonged to be back at Belton, which he had left only that morning.\nYes, on that very morning she had brought to him his coffee, looking\nsweetly into his face,--so sweetly as she ministered to him. And he\nmight then well have said one word more in pleading his suit, if he\nhad not been too awkward to know what that word should be. And was it\nnot his own awkwardness that had brought him to this state of misery?\nWhat right had he to suppose that any girl should fall in love with\nsuch a one as he at first sight,--without a moment's notice to her\nown heart? And then, when he had her there, almost in his arms, why\nhad he let her go without kissing her? It seemed to him now that if\nhe might have once kissed her, even that would have been a comfort to\nhim in his present affliction. \"D----tion!\" he said at last, as he\njumped to his feet and kicked the chair on one side, and threw the\npipe among the ashes. I trust it will be understood that he addressed\nhimself, and not his lady-love in this uncivil way,--\"D----tion!\"\nThen when the chair had been well kicked out of his way, he took\nhimself up to bed. I wonder whether Clara's heart would have been\nhardened or softened towards him had she heard the oath, and\nunderstood all the thoughts and motives which had produced it.\n\nOn the next morning poor Mary Belton was too ill to come down-stairs;\nand as her brother spent his whole day out upon the farm, remaining\namong reapers and wheat stacks till nine o'clock in the evening,\nnothing was said about Clara on that day. Then there came a Sunday,\nand it was a matter of course that the subject of which they both\nwere thinking should be discussed. Will went to church, and, as was\ntheir custom on Sundays, they dined immediately on his return. Then,\nas the afternoon was very warm, he took her out to a favourite seat\nshe had in the garden, and it became impossible that they could\nlonger abstain.\n\n\"And you really mean to go again at Christmas?\" she asked.\n\n\"Certainly I shall;--I promised.\"\n\n\"Then I am sure you will.\"\n\n\"And I must go from time to time because of the land I have taken.\nIndeed there seems to be an understanding that I am to manage the\nproperty for Mr. Amedroz.\"\n\n\"And does she wish you to go?\"\n\n\"Yes,--she says so.\"\n\n\"Girls, I believe, think sometimes that men are indifferent in their\nlove. They suppose that a man can forget it at once when he is not\naccepted, and that things can go on just as before.\"\n\n\"I suppose she thinks so of me,\" said Belton wofully.\n\n\"She must either think that, or else be willing to give herself the\nchance of learning to like you better.\"\n\n\"There's nothing of that, I'm sure. She's as true as steel.\"\n\n\"But she would hardly want you to go there unless she thought you\nmight overcome either your love or her indifference. She would not\nwish you to be there that you might be miserable.\"\n\n\"Before I had asked her to be my wife I had promised to be her\nbrother. And so I will, if she should ever want a brother. I am not\ngoing to desert her because she will not do what I want her to do,\nor be what I want her to be. She understands that. There is to be no\nquarrel between us.\"\n\n\"But she would be heartless if she were to encourage you to be with\nher simply for the assistance you may give her, knowing at the same\ntime that you could not be happy in her presence.\"\n\n\"She is not heartless.\"\n\n\"Then she must suppose that you are.\"\n\n\"I dare say she doesn't think that I care much about it. When I told\nher, I did it all of a heap, you see; and I fancy she thought I was\njust mad at the time.\"\n\n\"And did you speak about it again?\"\n\n\"No; not a word. I shouldn't wonder if she hadn't forgotten it before\nI went away.\"\n\n\"That would be impossible.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't say so if you knew how it was done. It was all over in\nhalf an hour; and she had given me such an answer that I thought I\nhad no right to say anything more about it. The morning when I left\nher she did seem to be kinder.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew whether she cares for any one else.\"\n\n\"Ah! I so often think of that. But I couldn't ask her, you know. I\nhad no right to pry into her secrets. When I came away, she got up to\nsee me off; and I almost felt tempted to carry her into the gig and\ndrive her off.\"\n\n\"I don't think that would have done, Will.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose anything will do. We all know what happens to the\nchild who cries for the top brick of the chimney. The child has to\ndo without it. The child goes to bed and forgets it; but I go to\nbed,--and can't forget it.\"\n\n\"My poor Will!\"\n\nThen he got up and shook himself, and stalked about the\ngarden,--always keeping within a few yards of his sister's\nchair,--and carried on a strong battle within his breast, struggling\nto get the better of the weakness which his love produced, though\nresolved that the love itself should be maintained.\n\n\"I wish it wasn't Sunday,\" he said at last, \"because then I could go\nand do something. If I thought that no one would see me, I'd fill a\ndung-cart or two, even though it is Sunday. I'll tell you what;--I'll\ngo and take a walk as far as Denvir Sluice; and I'll be back to tea.\nYou won't mind?\"\n\n\"Denvir Sluice is eight miles off.\"\n\n\"Exactly,--I'll be there and back in something over three hours.\"\n\n\"But, Will,--there's a broiling sun.\"\n\n\"It will do me good. Anything that will take something out of me is\nwhat I want. I know I ought to stay and read to you; but I couldn't\ndo it. I've got the fidgets inside, if you know what that means. To\nhave the big hay-rick on fire, or something of that sort, is what\nwould do me most good.\"\n\nThen he started, and did walk to Denvir Sluice and back in three\nhours. The road from Plaistow Hall to Denvir Sluice was not in itself\ninteresting. It ran through a perfectly flat country, without a tree.\nFor the greater part of the way it was constructed on the top of a\ngreat bank by the side of a broad dike, and for five miles its course\nwas straight as a line. A country walk less picturesque could hardly\nbe found in England. The road, too, was very dusty, and the sun\nwas hot above Belton's head as he walked. But nevertheless, he\npersevered, going on till he struck his stick against the waterfall\nwhich was called Denvir Sluice, and then returned,--not once\nslackening his pace, and doing the whole distance at a rate somewhat\nabove five miles an hour. They used to say in the nursery that cold\npudding is good to settle a man's love; but the receipt which Belton\ntried was a walk of sixteen miles, along a dusty road, after dinner,\nin the middle of an August day.\n\nI think it did him some good. When he got back he took a long draught\nof home-brewed beer, and then went up-stairs to dress himself.\n\n\"What a state you are in,\" Mary said to him when he showed himself\nfor a moment in the sitting-room.\n\n\"I did it from milestone to milestone in eleven minutes, backwards\nand forwards, all along the five-mile reach.\"\n\nThen Mary knew from his answer that the exercise had been of service\nto him, perceiving that he had been able to take an interest in his\nown prowess as a walker.\n\n\"I only hope you won't have a fever,\" she said.\n\n\"The people who stand still are they who get fevers,\" he answered.\n\"Hard work never does harm to any one. If John Bowden would walk his\nfive miles an hour on a Sunday afternoon he wouldn't have the gout so\noften.\"\n\nJohn Bowden was a neighbour in the next parish, and Mary was\ndelighted to find that her brother could take a pride in his\nperformance.\n\nBy degrees Miss Belton began to know with some accuracy the way in\nwhich Will had managed his affairs at Belton Castle, and was enabled\nto give him salutary advice.\n\n\"You see, Will,\" she said, \"ladies are different from men in this,\nthat they cannot allow themselves to be in love so suddenly.\"\n\n\"I don't see how a person is to help it. It isn't like jumping into a\nriver, which a person can do or not, just as he pleases.\"\n\n\"But I fancy it is something like jumping into a river, and that a\nperson can help it. What the person can't help is being in when the\nplunge has once been made.\"\n\n\"No, by George! There's no getting out of that river.\"\n\n\"And ladies don't take the plunge till they've had time to think what\nmay come after it. Perhaps you were a little too sudden with our\ncousin Clara?\"\n\n\"Of course I was. Of course I was a fool, and a brute too.\"\n\n\"I know you were not a brute, and I don't think you were a fool; but\nyet you were too sudden. You see a lady cannot always make up her\nmind to love a man, merely because she is asked--all in a moment. She\nshould have a little time to think about it before she is called upon\nfor an answer.\"\n\n\"And I didn't give her two minutes.\"\n\n\"You never do give two minutes to anyone;--do you, Will? But you'll\nbe back there at Christmas, and then she will have had time to turn\nyou and it over in her mind.\"\n\n\"And you think that I may have a chance?\"\n\n\"Certainty you may have a chance.\"\n\n\"Although she was so sure about it?\"\n\n\"She spoke of her own mind and her own heart as she knew them then.\nBut it depends chiefly on this, Will,--whether there is any one else.\nFor anything we know, she may be engaged now.\"\n\n\"Of course she may.\" Then Belton speculated on the extreme\nprobability of such a contingency; arguing within his own heart that\nof course every unmarried man who might see Clara would want to marry\nher, and that there could not but be some one whom even she would be\nable to love.\n\nWhen he had been home about a fortnight, there came a letter to him\nfrom Clara, which was a great treasure to him. In truth, it simply\ntold him of the completion of the cattle-shed, of her father's\nhealth, and of the milk which the little cow gave; but she signed\nherself his affectionate cousin, and the letter was very gratifying\nto him. There were two lines of a postscript, which could not but\nflatter him:--\"Papa is so anxious for Christmas, that you may be here\nagain;--and so, indeed, am I also.\" Of course it will be understood\nthat this was written before Clara's visit to Perivale, and before\nMrs. Winterfield's death. Indeed, much happened in Clara's history\nbetween the writing of that letter and Will Belton's winter visit to\nthe Castle.\n\nBut Christmas came at last, all too slowly for Will;--and he started\non his journey. On this occasion he arranged to stay a week in\nLondon, having a lawyer there whom he desired to see; and thinking,\nperhaps, that a short time spent among the theatres might assist him\nin his love troubles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nMR. WILLIAM BELTON TAKES A WALK IN LONDON.\n\n\nAt the time of my story there was a certain Mr. Green, a worthy\nattorney, who held chambers in Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn, much\nto the profit of himself and family,--and to the profit and comfort\nalso of a numerous body of clients,--a man much respected in the\nneighbourhood of Chancery Lane, and beloved, I do not doubt, in the\nneighbourhood of Bushey, in which delightfully rural parish he was\npossessed of a genteel villa and ornamental garden. With Mr. Green's\nprivate residence we shall, I believe, have no further concern; but\nto him at his chambers in Stone Buildings I must now introduce the\nreader of these memoirs. He was a man not yet forty years of age,\nwith still much of the salt of youth about him, a pleasant companion\nas well as a good lawyer, and one who knew men and things in London,\nas it is given to pleasant clever fellows, such as Joseph Green, to\nknow them. Now Mr. Green, and his father before him, had been the\nlegal advisers of the Amedroz family, and our Mr. Joseph Green had\nhad but a bad time of it with Charles Amedroz in the last years of\nthat unfortunate young man's life. But lawyers endure these troubles,\nsubmitting themselves to the extravagances, embarrassments, and even\nvillany of the bad subjects among their clients' families, with a\ngood-humoured patience that is truly wonderful. That, however, was\nall over now as regarded Mr. Green and the Amedrozes, and he had\nnothing further to do but to save for the father what relics of the\nproperty he might secure. And he was also legal adviser to our friend\nWill Belton, there having been some old family connection among them,\nand had often endeavoured to impress upon his old client at Belton\nCastle his own strong conviction that the heir was a generous fellow,\nwho might be trusted in everything. But this had been taken amiss\nby the old squire, who, indeed, was too much disposed to take all\nthings amiss and to suspect everybody. \"I understand,\" he had said\nto his daughter. \"I know all about it. Belton and Mr. Green have\nbeen dear friends always. I can't trust my own lawyer any longer.\" In\nall which the old squire showed much ingratitude. It will, however,\nbe understood that these suspicions were rife before the time of\nBelton's visit to the family estate.\n\nSome four or five days before Christmas there came a visitor to Mr.\nGreen with whom the reader is acquainted, and who was no less a man\nthan the Member for Perivale. Captain Aylmer, when Clara parted from\nhim on the morning of her return to Belton Castle, had resolved that\nhe would repeat his offer of marriage by letter. A month had passed\nby since then, and he had not as yet repeated it. But his intention\nwas not altered. He was a deliberate man, who did not do such things\nquite as quickly as his rival, and who upon this occasion had thought\nit prudent to turn over more than once in his mind all that he\nproposed to do. Nor had he as yet taken any definite steps as to that\nfifteen hundred pounds which he had promised to Clara in her aunt's\nname, and which Clara had been, and was, so unwilling to receive. He\nhad now actually paid it over, having purchased government stock in\nClara's name for the amount, and had called upon Mr. Green, in order\nthat that gentleman, as Clara's lawyer, might make the necessary\ncommunication to her.\n\n\"I suppose there's nothing further to be done?\" asked Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"Nothing further by me,\" said the lawyer. \"Of course I shall write to\nher, and explain that she must make arrangements as to the interest.\nI am very glad that her aunt thought of her in her last moments.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Winterfield would have provided for her before, had she known\nthat everything had been swallowed up by that unfortunate young man.\"\n\n\"All's well that ends well. Fifteen hundred pounds are better than\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Is it not enough?\" said the Captain, blushing.\n\n\"It isn't for me to have an opinion about that, Captain Aylmer.\nIt depends on the nature of the claim; and that again depends on\nthe relative position of the aunt and niece when they were alive\ntogether.\"\n\n\"You are aware that Miss Amedroz was not Mrs. Winterfield's niece?\"\n\n\"Do not think for a moment that I am criticising the amount of the\nlegacy. I am very glad of it, as, without it, there was literally no\nprovision,--no provision at all.\"\n\n\"You will write to herself?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly to herself. She is a better man of business than\nher father;--and then this is her own, to do as she likes with it.\"\n\n\"She can't refuse it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Refuse it!\"\n\n\"Even though she did not wish to take it, it would be legally her\nproperty, just as though it had been really left by the will?\"\n\n\"Well; I don't know. I dare say you could have resisted the payment.\nBut that has been made now, and there seems to be an end of it.\"\n\nAt this moment a clerk entered the room and handed a card to his\nemployer. \"Here's the heir himself,\" said Mr. Green.\n\n\"What heir?\"\n\n\"Will Belton;--the heir of the property which Mr. Amedroz holds.\"\nCaptain Aylmer had soon explained that he was not personally\nacquainted with Mr. William Belton; but, having heard much about\nhim, declared himself anxious to make the acquaintance. Our friend\nWill, therefore, was ushered into the room, and the two rivals for\nClara's favour were introduced to each other. Each had heard much\nof the other, and each had heard of the other from the same person.\nBut Captain Aylmer knew much more as to Belton than Belton knew in\nrespect to him. Aylmer knew that Belton had proposed to Clara and had\nbeen rejected; and he knew also that Belton was now again going down\nto Somersetshire.\n\n\"You are to spend your Christmas, I believe, with our friends at\nBelton Castle?\" said the Captain.\n\n\"Yes;--and am now on my way there. I believe you know them\nalso,--intimately.\" Then there was some explanation as to the\nWinterfield connection, a few remarks as to the precarious state of\nthe old squire's health, a message or two from Captain Aylmer, which\nof course were of no importance, and the Captain took his leave.\n\nThen Green and Belton became very comfortably intimate in their\nconversation, calling each other Will and Joe,--for they were old\nand close friends. And they discussed matters in that cozy tone of\nconfidential intercourse which is so directly at variance with the\ntones used by men when they ordinarily talk of business. \"He has\nbrought me good news for your friend, Miss Amedroz,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"What good news?\"\n\n\"That aunt of hers left her fifteen hundred pounds, after all. Or\nrather, she did not leave it, but desired on her death-bed that it\nmight be given.\"\n\n\"That's the same thing, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh quite;--that is to say, it's the same thing if the person who has\nto hand over the money does not dispute the legacy. But it shows how\nthe old lady's conscience pricked her at last. And after all it was a\nshabby sum, and should have been three times as much.\"\n\n\"Fifteen hundred pounds! And that is all she will have when her\nfather dies?\"\n\n\"Every farthing, Will. You'll take all the rest.\"\n\n\"I wish she wasn't going to have that.\"\n\n\"Why? Why on earth should you of all men grudge her such a moderate\nmaintenance, seeing that you have not got to pay it?\"\n\n\"It isn't a maintenance. How could it be a maintenance for such as\nher? What sort of maintenance would it be?\"\n\n\"Much better than nothing. And so you would feel if she were your\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"She shall be my daughter, or my sister, or whatever you like to call\nher. You don't think that I'll take the whole estate and leave her to\nstarve on the interest of fifteen hundred pounds a year!\"\n\n\"You'd better make her your wife at once, Will.\"\n\nWill Belton blushed as he answered, \"That, perhaps, would be easier\nsaid than done. That is not in my power,--even if I should wish it.\nBut the other is in my power.\"\n\n\"Will, take my advice, and don't make any romantic promises when you\nare down at Belton. You'll be sure to regret them if you do. And you\nshould remember that in truth Miss Amedroz has no greater claim on\nyou than any other lady in the land.\"\n\n\"Isn't she my cousin?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes. She is your cousin, but a distant one only; and I'm not\naware that cousinship gives any claim.\"\n\n\"Who is she to have a claim on? I'm the nearest she has got. Besides,\nam not I going to take all the property which ought to be hers?\"\n\n\"That's just it. There's no such ought in the case. The property is\nas much your own as this poker is mine. That's exactly the mistake I\nwant you to guard against. If you liked her, and chose to marry her,\nthat would be all very well; presuming that you don't want to get\nmoney in marriage.\"\n\n\"I hate the idea of marrying for money.\"\n\n\"All right. Then marry Miss Amedroz if you please. But don't make any\nrash undertakings to be her father, or her brother, or her uncle, or\nher aunt. Such romance always leads a man into trouble.\"\n\n\"But I've done it already.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I've told her that I would be her brother, and that as long as I had\na shilling she should never want sixpence. And I mean it. And as for\nwhat you say about romance and repenting it, that simply comes from\nyour being a lawyer.\"\n\n\"Thank ye, Will.\"\n\n\"If one goes to a chemist, of course one gets physic, and has to put\nup with the bad smells.\"\n\n\"Thank you again.\"\n\n\"But the chemist may be a very good sort of fellow at home all the\nsame, and have a cupboard full of sweetmeats and a garden full of\nflowers. However, the thing is done as far as I am concerned, and I\ncan almost find it in my heart to be sorry that Clara has got this\ndriblet of money. Fifteen hundred pounds! It would keep her out of\nthe workhouse, and that is about all.\"\n\n\"If you knew how many ladies in her position would think that the\nheavens had rained wealth upon them if some one would give them\nfifteen hundred pounds!\"\n\n\"Very well. At any rate I won't take it away from her. And now I want\nyou to tell me something else. Do you remember a fellow we used to\nknow named Berdmore?\"\n\n\"Philip Berdmore?\"\n\n\"He may have been Philip, or Daniel, or Jeremiah, for anything I\nknow. But the man I mean was very much given to taking his liquor\nfreely.\"\n\n\"That was Jack Berdmore, Philip's brother. Oh yes, I remember him.\nHe's dead now. He drank himself to death at last, out in India.\"\n\n\"He was in the army?\"\n\n\"Yes;--and what a pleasant fellow he was at times! I see Phil\nconstantly, and Phil's wife, but they never speak of Jack.\"\n\n\"He got married, didn't he, after we used to see him?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--he and Phil married sisters. It was a sad affair, that.\"\n\n\"I remember being with him and her,--and the sister too, after they\nwere engaged, and he got so drunk that we were obliged to take him\naway. There was a large party of us at Richmond, but I don't think\nyou were there.\"\n\n\"But I heard of it.\"\n\n\"And she was a Miss Vigo?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I see the younger sister constantly. Phil isn't very rich,\nand he's got a lot of children,--but he's very happy.\"\n\n\"What became of the other sister?\"\n\n\"Of Jack's wife?\"\n\n\"Yes. What became of her?\"\n\n\"I haven't an idea. Something bad, I suppose, as they never speak of\nher.\"\n\n\"And how long is he dead?\"\n\n\"He died about three years since. I only knew it from Phil's telling\nme that he was in mourning for him. Then he did speak of him for a\nmoment or two, and I came to know that he had carried on to the end\nin the same way. If a fellow takes to drink in this country, he'll\nnever get cured in India.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"And now I want to find out something about his widow.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Ah;--I'm not sure that I can tell you why. Indeed I'm sure that I\ncannot. But still you might be able to assist me.\"\n\n\"There were heaps of people who used to know the Vigos,\" said the\nlawyer.\n\n\"No end of people,--though I couldn't for the life of me say who any\nof them were.\"\n\n\"They used to come out in London with an aunt, but nobody knew much\nabout her. I fancy they had neither father nor mother.\"\n\n\"They were very pretty.\"\n\n\"And how well they danced! I don't think I ever knew a girl who\ndanced so pleasantly,--giving herself no airs, you know,--as Mary\nVigo.\"\n\n\"Her name was Mary,\" said Belton, remembering that Mrs. Askerton's\nname was also Mary.\n\n\"Jack Berdmore married Mary.\"\n\n\"Well now, Joe, you must find out for me what became of her. Was she\nwith her husband when he died?\"\n\n\"Nobody was with him. Phil told me so. No one, that is, but a young\nlieutenant and his own servant. It was very sad. He had D.T., and all\nthat sort of thing.\"\n\n\"And where was she?\"\n\n\"At Jericho, for anything that I know.\"\n\n\"Will you find out?\" Then Mr. Joseph Green thought for a moment of\nhis capabilities in that line, and having made an engagement to dine\nwith his friend at his club on the evening before Will left London,\nsaid at last that he thought he could find out through certain mutual\nfriends who had known the Berdmores in the old days. \"But the fact\nis,\" said the lawyer, \"that the world is so good-natured,--instead of\nbeing ill-natured, as people say,--that it always forgets those who\nwant to be forgotten.\"\n\nWe must now go back for a few moments to Captain Aylmer and his\naffairs. Having given a full month to the consideration of his\nposition as regarded Miss Amedroz, he made up his mind to two things.\nIn the first place, he would at once pay over to her the money\nwhich was to be hers as her aunt's legacy, and then he would renew\nhis offer. To that latter determination he was guided by mixed\nmotives,--by motives which, when joined together, rarely fail to be\noperative. His conscience told him that he ought to do so,--and then\nthe fact of her having, as it were, taken herself away from him, made\nhim again wish to possess her. And there was another cause which,\nperhaps, operated in the same direction. He had consulted his mother,\nand she had strongly advised him to have nothing further to do with\nMiss Amedroz. Lady Aylmer abused her dead sister heartily for having\ninterfered in the matter, and endeavoured to prove to her son that\nhe was released from his promise by having in fact performed it. But\non this point his conscience interfered,--backed by his wishes,--and\nhe made his resolve as has been above stated. On leaving Mr. Green's\nchambers he went to his own lodgings, and wrote his letter, as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   Mount Street, December, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST CLARA,\n\n   When you parted from me at Perivale you said certain\n   things about our engagement which I have come to\n   understand better since then, than I did at the time.\n   It escaped from me that my dear aunt and I had had some\n   conversation about you, and that I had told her what was\n   my intention. Something was said about a promise, and I\n   think it was that word which made you unhappy. At such a\n   time as that, when I and my aunt were talking together,\n   and when she was, as she well knew, on her deathbed,\n   things will be said which would not be thought of in other\n   circumstances. I can only assure you now, that the promise\n   I gave her was a promise to do that which I had previously\n   resolved upon doing. If you can believe what I say on this\n   head, that ought to be sufficient to remove the feeling\n   which induced you to break our engagement.\n\n   I now write to renew my offer to you, and to assure you\n   that I do so with my whole heart. You will forgive me if\n   I tell you that I cannot fail to remember, and always to\n   bear in my mind, the sweet assurances which you gave me of\n   your regard for myself. As I do not know that anything has\n   occurred to alter your opinion of me, I write this letter\n   in strong hope that it may be successful. I believe that\n   your fear was in respect to my affection for you, not as\n   to yours for me. If this was so, I can assure you that\n   there is no necessity for such fear.\n\n   I need not tell you that I shall expect your answer with\n   great anxiety.\n\n   Yours most affectionately,\n\n   F. F. AYLMER.\n\n   P.S. I have to-day caused to be bought in your name Bank\n   Stock to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds, the amount\n   of the legacy coming to you from my aunt.\n\n\nThis letter, and that from Mr. Green respecting the money, both\nreached Clara on the same morning. Now, having learned so much as to\nthe position of affairs at Belton Castle, we may return to Will and\nhis dinner engagement with Mr. Joseph Green.\n\n\"And what have you heard about Mrs. Berdmore?\" Belton asked, almost\nas soon as the two men were together.\n\n\"I wish I knew why you want to know.\"\n\n\"I don't want to do anybody any harm.\"\n\n\"Do you want to do anybody any good?\"\n\n\"Any good! I can't say that I want to do any particular good. The\ntruth is, I think I know where she is, and that she is living under a\nfalse name.\"\n\n\"Then you know more of her than I do.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything. I'm only in doubt. But as the lady I mean\nlives near to friends of mine, I should like to know.\"\n\n\"That you may expose her?\"\n\n\"No;--by no means. But I hate the idea of deceit. The truth is, that\nany one living anywhere under a false name should be exposed,--or\nshould be made to assume their right name.\"\n\n\"I find that Mrs. Berdmore left her husband some years before he\ndied. There was nothing in that to create wonder, for he was a man\nwith whom a woman could hardly continue to live. But I fear she left\nhim under protection that was injurious to her character.\"\n\n\"And how long ago is that?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Some years before his death.\"\n\n\"And how long ago did he die?\"\n\n\"About three years since. My informant tells me that he believes she\nhas since married. Now you know all that I know.\" And Belton also\nknew that Mrs. Askerton of the cottage was the Miss Vigo with whom he\nhad been acquainted in earlier years.\n\nAfter that they dined comfortably, and nothing passed between them\nwhich need be recorded as essential to our story till the time came\nfor them to part. Then, when they were both standing at the club\ndoor, the lawyer said a word or two which is essential. \"So you're\noff to-morrow?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes; I shall go down by the express.\"\n\n\"I wish you a pleasant journey. By-the-by, I ought to tell you that\nyou won't have any trouble in being either father or mother, or uncle\nor aunt to Miss Amedroz.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I suppose it's no secret.\"\n\n\"What's no secret?\"\n\n\"She's going to be married to Captain Aylmer.\"\n\nThen Will Belton started so violently, and assumed on a sudden so\nmanifest a look of anger, that his tale was at once told to Mr.\nGreen. \"Who says so?\" he asked. \"I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's true all the same, Will.\"\n\n\"Who says it?\"\n\n\"Captain Aylmer was with me to-day, and he told me. He ought to be\ngood authority on such a subject.\"\n\n\"He told you that he was going to marry Clara Amedroz?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"And what made him come to you, to tell you?\"\n\n\"There was a question about some money which he had paid to her, and\nwhich, under existing circumstances, he thought it as well that he\nshould not pay. Matters of that kind are often necessarily told to\nlawyers. But I should not have told it to you, Will, if I had not\nthought that it was good news.\"\n\n\"It is not good news,\" said Belton moodily.\n\n\"At any rate, old fellow, my telling it will do no harm. You must\nhave learned it soon.\" And he put his hand kindly,--almost tenderly,\non the other's arm. But Belton moved himself away angrily. The wound\nhad been so lately inflicted that he could not as yet forgive the\nhand that had seemed to strike him.\n\n\"I'm sorry that it should be so bad with you, Will.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by bad? It is not bad with me. It is very well\nwith me. Keep your pity for those who want it.\" Then he walked off\nby himself across the broad street before the club door, leaving\nhis friend without a word of farewell, and made his way up into St.\nJames's Square, choosing, as was evident to Mr. Green, the first\nstreet that would take him out of sight.\n\n\"He's hit, and hit hard,\" said the lawyer, looking after him. \"Poor\nfellow! I might have guessed it from what he said. I never knew of\nhis caring for any woman before.\" Then Mr. Green put on his gloves\nand went away home.\n\nWe will now follow Will Belton into St. James's Square, and we shall\nfollow a very unhappy gentleman. Doubtless he had hitherto known and\nappreciated the fact that Miss Amedroz had refused his offer, and had\noften declared, both to himself and to his sister, his conviction\nthat that refusal would never be reversed. But, in spite of that\nexpressed conviction, he had lived on hope. Till she belonged to\nanother man she might yet be his. He might win her at last by\nperseverance. At any rate he had it in his power to work towards the\ndesired end, and might find solace even in that working. And the\nmisery of his loss would not be so great to him,--as he found himself\nforced to confess to himself before he had completed his wanderings\non this night,--in not having her for his own, as it would be in\nknowing that she had given herself to another man. He had often told\nhimself that of course she would become the wife of some man, but he\nhad never yet realised to himself what it would be to know that she\nwas the wife of any one specified rival. He had been sad enough on\nthat moonlight night in the avenue at Plaistow,--when he had leaned\nagainst the tree, striking his hands together as he thought of his\ngreat want; but his unhappiness then had been as nothing to his agony\nnow. Now it was all over,--and he knew the man who had supplanted\nhim!\n\nHow he hated him! With what an unchristian spirit did he regard that\nworthy captain as he walked across St. James's Square, across Jermyn\nStreet, across Piccadilly, and up Bond Street, not knowing whither he\nwas going. He thought with an intense regret of the laws of modern\nsociety which forbid duelling,--forgetting altogether that even had\nthe old law prevailed, the conduct of the man whom he so hated would\nhave afforded him no _casus belli_. But he was too far gone in misery\nand animosity to be capable of any reason on the matter. Captain\nAylmer had interfered with his dearest wishes, and during this now\npassing hour he would willingly have crucified Captain Aylmer had\nit been within his power to do so. Till he had gone beyond Oxford\nStreet, and had wandered away into the far distance of Portman Square\nand Baker Street, he had not begun to think of any interest which\nClara Amedroz might have in the matter on which his thoughts were\nemployed. He was sojourning at an hotel in Bond Street, and had gone\nthitherwards more by habit than by thought; but he had passed the\ndoor of his inn, feeling it to be impossible to render himself up to\nhis bed in his present disturbed mood. As he was passing the house\nin Bond Street he had been intent on the destruction of Captain\nAylmer,--and had almost determined that if Captain Aylmer could not\nbe made to vanish into eternity, he must make up his mind to go that\nroad himself.\n\nIt was out of the question that he should go down to Belton. As to\nthat he had come to a very decided opinion by the time that he had\ncrossed Oxford Street. Go down to see her, when she had treated him\nafter this fashion! No, indeed. She wanted no brother now. She had\nchosen to trust herself to this other man, and he, Will Belton,\nwould not interfere further in her affairs. Then he drew upon his\nimagination for a picture of the future, in which he portrayed\nCaptain Aylmer as a ruined man, who would probably desert his wife,\nand make himself generally odious to all his acquaintance--a picture\nas to the realisation of which I am bound to say that Captain\nAylmer's antecedents gave no probability. But it was the looking\nat this self-drawn picture which first softened the artist's heart\ntowards the victim whom he had immolated on his imaginary canvas.\nWhen Clara should be ruined by the baseness and villany and general\nscampishness of this man whom she was going to marry,--to whom she\nwas about to be weak enough and fool enough to trust herself,--then\nhe would interpose and be her brother once again,--a broken-hearted\nbrother no doubt, but a brother efficacious to keep the wolf from\nthe door of this poor woman and her--children. Then, as he thus\ncreated Captain Aylmer's embryo family of unprovided orphans,--for\nafter a while he killed the captain, making him to die some death\nthat was very disgraceful, but not very distinct even to his own\nimagination,--as he thought of those coming pledges of a love which\nwas to him so bitter, he stormed about the streets, performing antics\nof which no one would have believed him capable, who had known him as\nthe thriving Mr. William Belton, of Plaistow Hall, among the fens of\nNorfolk.\n\nBut the character of a man is not to be judged from the pictures\nwhich he may draw or from the antics which he may play in his\nsolitary hours. Those who act generally with the most consummate\nwisdom in the affairs of the world, often meditate very silly doings\nbefore their wiser resolutions form themselves. I beg, therefore,\nthat Mr. Belton may be regarded and criticised in accordance with his\nconduct on the following morning,--when his midnight rambles, which\nfinally took him even beyond the New Road, had been followed by a few\ntranquil hours in his Bond Street bedroom:--for at last he did bring\nhimself to return thither and put himself to bed after the usual\nfashion. He put himself to bed in a spirit somewhat tranquillised by\nthe exercise of the night, and at last--wept himself to sleep like a\nbaby.\n\nBut he was by no means like a baby when he took him early on the\nfollowing morning to the Paddington Station, and booked himself\nmanfully for Taunton. He had had time to recognise the fact that he\nhad no ground of quarrel with his cousin because she had preferred\nanother man to him. This had happened to him as he was recrossing\nthe New Road about two o'clock, and was beginning to find that his\nlegs were weary under him. And, indeed, he had recognised one or two\nthings before he had gone to sleep with his tears dripping on to his\npillow. In the first place, he had ill-treated Joe Green, and had\nmade a fool of himself in his friend's presence. As Joe Green was a\nsensible, kind-hearted fellow, this did not much signify;--but not\non that account did he omit to tell himself of his own fault. Then\nhe discovered that it would ill become him to break his word to Mr.\nAmedroz and to his daughter, and to do so without a word of excuse,\nbecause Clara had exercised a right which was indisputably her own.\nHe had undertaken certain work at Belton which required his presence,\nand he would go down and do his work as though nothing had occurred\nto disturb him. To remain away because of this misfortune would be to\nshow the white feather. It would be unmanly. All this he recognised\nas the pictures he had painted faded away from their canvases. As to\nCaptain Aylmer himself, he hoped that he might never be called upon\nto meet him. He still hoped that, even as he was resolutely cramming\nhis shirts into his portmanteau before he began his journey. His\ncousin Clara he thought he could meet, and tender to her some\nexpression of good wishes as to her future life, without giving way\nunder the effort. And to the old squire he could endeavour to make\nhimself pleasant, speaking of the relief from all trouble which this\nmarriage with Captain Aylmer would afford,--for now, in his cooler\nmoments, he could perceive that Captain Aylmer was not a man apt\nto ruin himself, or his wife and children. But to Captain Aylmer\nhimself, he could not bring himself to say pleasant things or to\nexpress pleasant wishes. She who was to be Captain Aylmer's wife, who\nloved him, would of course have told him what had occurred up among\nthe rocks in Belton Park; and if that was so, any meeting between\nWill and Captain Aylmer would be death to the former.\n\nThinking of all this he journeyed down to Taunton, and thinking of\nall this he made his way from Taunton across to Belton Park.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nEVIL WORDS.\n\n\nClara Amedroz had received her two letters together,--that, namely,\nfrom the attorney, and that from Captain Aylmer,--and the result of\nthose letters is already known. She accepted her lover's renewed\noffer of marriage, acknowledging the force of his logic, and putting\nfaith in the strength of his assurances. This she did without seeking\nadvice from any one. Who was there from whom she could seek advice on\nsuch a matter as that?--who, at least, was there at Belton? That her\nfather would, as a matter of course, bid her accept Captain Aylmer,\nwas, she thought, certain; and she knew well that Mrs. Askerton would\ndo the same. She asked no counsel from any one, but taking the two\nletters up to her own room, sat down to consider them. That which\nreferred to her aunt's money, together with the postscript in Captain\nAylmer's letter on the same subject, would be of the least possible\nmoment if she could bring herself to give a favourable answer to the\nother proposition. But should she not be able to do this,--should she\nhesitate as to doing so at once,--then she must write to the lawyer\nin very strong terms, refusing altogether to have anything to do with\nthe money. And in such a case as this, not a word could she say to\nher father either on one subject or on the other.\n\nBut why should she not accept the offer made to her? Captain Aylmer\ndeclared that he had determined to ask her to be his wife before he\nhad made any promise to Mrs. Winterfield. If this were in truth so,\nthen the very ground on which she had separated herself from him\nwould be removed. Why should she hesitate in acknowledging to herself\nthat she loved the man and believed him to be true? So she sat\nherself down and answered both the letters,--writing to the lawyer\nfirst. To him she said that nothing need be done about the money or\nthe interest till he should see or hear from Captain Aylmer again.\nThen to Captain Aylmer she wrote very shortly, but very openly,--with\nthe same ill-judged candour which her spoken words to him had\ndisplayed. Of course she would be his; his without hesitation, now\nthat she knew that he expressed his own wishes, and not merely\nthose of his aunt. \"As to the money,\" she said, \"it would be simply\nnonsense now for us to have any talk of money. It is yours in any\nway, and you had better manage about it as you please. I have written\nan ambiguous letter to Mr. Green, which will simply plague him, and\nwhich you may go and see if you like.\" Then she added her postscript,\nin which she said that she should now at once tell her father, as\nthe news would remove from his mind all solicitude as to her future\nposition. That Captain Aylmer did go to Mr. Green we already know,\nand we know also that he told Mr. Green of his intended marriage.\n\nNothing was said by Captain Aylmer as to any proposed period for\ntheir marriage; but that was only natural. It was not probable that\nany man would name a day till he knew whether or not he was accepted.\nIndeed, Clara, on thinking over the whole affair, was now disposed to\nfind fault rather with herself than with her lover, and forgetting\nhis coldness and formality at Perivale, remembered only the fact of\nhis offer to her, and his assurance now received that he had intended\nto make it before the scene which had taken place between him and\nhis aunt. She did find fault with herself, telling herself that\nshe had quarrelled with him without sufficient cause;--and the\neager, loving candour of her letter to him was attributable to those\nself-accusations.\n\n\"Papa,\" she said, after the postman had gone away from Belton, so\nthat there might be no possibility of any recall of her letter, \"I\nhave something to tell you which I hope will give you pleasure.\"\n\n\"It isn't often that I hear anything of that kind,\" said he.\n\n\"But I think that this will give you pleasure. I do indeed. I am\ngoing to be married.\"\n\n\"Going to what?\"\n\n\"Going to be married, papa. That is, if I have your leave. Of course\nany offer of that kind that I have accepted is subject to your\napproval.\"\n\n\"And I have been told nothing about it!\"\n\n\"It began at Perivale, and I could not tell you then. You do not ask\nme who is to be my husband.\"\n\n\"It is not Will Belton?\"\n\n\"Poor Will! No; it is not Will. It is Frederic Aylmer. I think you\nwould prefer him as a son-in-law even to my cousin Will.\"\n\n\"No I shouldn't. Why should I prefer a man whom I don't even know,\nwho lives in London, and who will take you away, so that I shall\nnever see you again?\"\n\n\"Dear papa;--don't speak of it in that way. I thought you would be\nglad to know that I was to be so--so--so happy!\"\n\n\"But why is it to be done this way,--of a sudden? Why didn't he come\nto me? Will came to me the very first thing.\"\n\n\"He couldn't come all the way to Belton very well;--particularly as\nhe does not know you.\"\n\n\"Will came here.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, don't make difficulties. Of course that was different. He\nwas here when he first thought of it. And even then he didn't think\nvery much about it.\"\n\n\"He did all that he could, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes. I don't know how that might be.\" And Clara almost\nlaughed as she felt the difficulties into which she was creeping.\n\"Dear Will. He is much better as a cousin than as a husband.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all. Captain Aylmer will not have the Belton\nestate or Plaistow Hall.\"\n\n\"Surely he is well enough off to take care of a wife. He will have\nthe whole of the Perivale estate, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it. According to my ideas of what is\nproper he should have spoken to me first. If he could not come he\nmight have written. No doubt my ideas may be old-fashioned, and I'm\ntold that Captain Aylmer is a fashionable young man.\"\n\n\"Indeed he is not, papa. He is a hard-working member of Parliament.\"\n\n\"I don't know that he is any better for that. People seem to think\nthat if a man is a member of Parliament he may do what he pleases.\nThere is Thompson, the member for Minehead, who has bought some sort\nof place out by the moors. I never saw so vulgar, pig-headed a fellow\nin my life. Being in Parliament used to be something when I was\nyoung, but it won't make a man a gentleman now-a-days. It seems to\nme that none but brewers, and tallow-chandlers, and lawyers go into\nParliament now. Will Belton could go into Parliament if he pleased,\nbut he knows better than that. He won't make himself such a fool.\"\n\nThis was not comfortable to Clara; but she knew her father, and\nallowed him to go on with his grumbling. He would come round by\ndegrees, and he would appreciate, if he could not be induced to\nacknowledge, the wisdom of the step she was about to take.\n\n\"When is it to be?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing of that kind has ever been mentioned, papa.\"\n\n\"It had better be soon, if I am to have anything to do with it.\" Now\nit was certainly the case that the old man was very ill. He had not\nbeen out of the house since Clara had returned home; and, though he\nwas always grumbling about his food, he could hardly be induced to\neat anything when the morsels for which he expressed a wish were got\nfor him.\n\n\"Of course you will be consulted, papa, before anything is settled.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be in anybody's way, my dear.\"\n\n\"And may I tell Frederic that you have given your consent?\"\n\n\"What's the use of my consenting or not consenting? If you had been\nanxious to oblige me you would have taken your cousin Will.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, how could I accept a man I didn't love?\"\n\n\"You seemed to me to be very fond of him at first; and I must say, I\nthought he was ill-treated.\"\n\n\"Papa, papa; do not say such things as that to me!\"\n\n\"What am I to do? You tell me, and I can't altogether hold my\ntongue.\" Then there was a pause. \"Well, my dear, as for my consent,\nof course you may have it,--if it's worth anything. I don't know that\nI ever heard anything bad about Captain Aylmer.\"\n\nHe had heard nothing bad about Captain Aylmer! Clara, as she left her\nfather, felt that this was very grievous. Whatever cause she might\nhave had for discontent with her lover, she could not but be aware\nthat he was a man whom any father might be proud to welcome as a\nsuitor for his daughter. He was a man as to whom no ill tales had\never been told;--who had never been known to do anything wrong or\nimprudent; who had always been more than respectable, and as to whose\nworldly position no exception could be taken. She had been entitled\nto expect her father's warmest congratulations, and her tidings had\nbeen received as though she had proposed to give her hand to one\nwhose character and position only just made it not imperative on the\nfather to withhold his consent! All this was hard, and feeling it\nto be so, she went up-stairs, all alone, and cried bitterly as she\nthought of it.\n\nOn the next day she went down to the cottage and saw Mrs. Askerton.\nShe went there with the express purpose of telling her friend of her\nengagement,--desirous of obtaining in that quarter the sympathy which\nher father declined to give her. Had her communication to him been\naccepted in a different spirit, she might probably have kept her\nsecret from Mrs. Askerton till something further had been fixed about\nher marriage; but she was in want of a few kind words, and pined\nfor some of that encouragement which ladies in love usually wish to\nreceive, at any rate from some one chosen friend. But when she found\nherself alone with Mrs. Askerton she hardly knew how to tell her\nnews; and at first could not tell it at all, as that lady was eager\nin speaking on another subject.\n\n\"When do you expect your cousin?\" Mrs. Askerton asked, almost as soon\nas Clara was seated.\n\n\"The day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And he is in London now?\"\n\n\"He may be. I dare say he is. But I don't know anything about it.\"\n\n\"I can tell you then that he is. Colonel Askerton has heard of his\nbeing there.\"\n\n\"You seem to speak of it as though there were some offence in it. Is\nthere any reason why he should not be in London if he pleases?\"\n\n\"None in the least. I would much rather that he should be there than\nhere.\"\n\n\"Why so? Will his coming hurt you?\"\n\n\"I don't like him. I don't like him at all;--and now you know the\ntruth. You believe in him;--I don't. You think him to be a fine\nfellow and a gentleman, whereas I don't think him to be either.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton!\"\n\n\"This is strong language, I know.\"\n\n\"Very strong language.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; but the truth is, Clara, that you and I, living\ntogether here this sort of hermit's life, each seeing so much of\nthe other and seeing nothing of anybody else, must either be real\nfriends, telling each other what we think, or we must be nothing. We\ncan't go on with the ordinary make-believes of society, saying little\ncivil speeches and not going beyond them. Therefore I have made up my\nmind to tell you in plain language that I don't like your cousin, and\ndon't believe in him.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by believing in a man.\"\n\n\"I believe in you. Sometimes I have thought that you believe in me,\nand sometimes I have feared that you do not. I think that you are\ngood, and honest, and true; and therefore I like to see your face and\nhear your voice,--though it is not often that you say very pleasant\nthings to me.\"\n\n\"Do I say unpleasant things?\"\n\n\"I am not going to quarrel with you,--not if I can help it. What\nbusiness has Mr. Belton to go about London making inquiries as to me?\nWhat have I done to him, that he should honour me so far?\"\n\n\"Has he made inquiries?\"\n\n\"Yes; he has. If you have been contented with me as I am,--if you are\nsatisfied, why should he want to learn more? If you have any question\nto ask me I will answer it. But what right can he have to be asking\nquestions among strangers?\"\n\nClara had no question to ask, and yet she could not say that she was\nsatisfied. She would have been better satisfied to have known more of\nMrs. Askerton, but yet she had never condescended to make inquiries\nabout her friend. But her curiosity was now greatly raised; and,\nindeed, Mrs. Askerton's manner was so strange, her vehemence so\nunusual, and her eagerness to rush into dangerous subjects so unlike\nher usual tranquillity in conversation, that Clara did not know how\nto answer her.\n\n\"I know nothing of any questioning,\" she said.\n\n\"I am sure you don't. Had I thought you did, much as I love\nyou,--valuable as your society is to me down in this desert,--I would\nnever speak to you again. But remember,--if you want to ask any\nquestions, and will ask them of me,--of me,--I will answer them, and\nwill not be angry.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to ask any questions.\"\n\n\"You may some day; and then you can remember what I say.\"\n\n\"And am I to understand that you are determined to quarrel with my\ncousin Will?\"\n\n\"Quarrel with him! I don't suppose that I shall see him. After what\nI have said it is not probable that you will bring him here, and the\nservant will have orders to say that I am not at home if he should\ncall. Luckily he and Colonel Askerton did not meet when he was here\nbefore.\"\n\n\"This is the most strange thing I ever heard in my life.\"\n\n\"You will understand it better, my dear, when he makes his\ncommunication to you.\"\n\n\"What communication?\"\n\n\"You'll find that he'll have a communication to make. He has been\nso diligent and so sharp that he'll have a great deal to tell, I do\nnot doubt. Only, remember, Clara, that if anything that he tells you\nmakes any difference in your feelings towards me, I shall expect\nyou to come to me and say so openly. If he makes his statement, let\nme make mine. I have a right to ask for that, after what I have\npromised.\"\n\n\"You may be sure that I will.\"\n\n\"I want nothing more. I have no distrust in you,--none in the least.\nI tell you that I believe in you. If you will do that, and will keep\nMr. William Belton out of my way during his visit to these parts,\nI shall be satisfied.\" For some time past Mrs. Askerton had been\nwalking about the room, but, as she now finished speaking, she\nsat herself down as though the subject was fully discussed and\ncompleted. For a minute or two she made an effort to resume her usual\ntranquillity of manner, and in doing so attempted to smile, as though\nridiculing her own energy. \"I knew I should make a fool of myself\nwhen you came,\" she said; \"and now I have done it.\"\n\n\"I don't think you have been a fool at all, but you may have been\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear, we shall see. It's very odd what a dislike I\ntook to that man the first time I saw him.\"\n\n\"And I am so fond of him!\"\n\n\"Yes; he has cozened you as he has your father. I am only glad that\nhe did not succeed in cozening you further than he did. But I ought\nto have known you better than to suppose you could give your heart of\nhearts to one who is--\"\n\n\"Do not abuse him any more.\"\n\n\"Who is so very unlike the sort of people with whom you have lived. I\nmay, at any rate, say that.\"\n\n\"I don't know that. I haven't lived much with any one yet,--except\npapa, and my aunt, and you.\"\n\n\"But you know a gentleman when you see him.\"\n\n\"Come, Mrs. Askerton, I will not stand this. I thought you had done\nwith the subject, and now you begin again. I had come here on purpose\nto tell you something of real importance,--that is, to me; but I must\ngo away without telling you, unless you will give over abusing my\ncousin.\"\n\n\"I will not say a word more about him,--not at present.\"\n\n\"I feel so sure that you are mistaken, you know.\"\n\n\"Very well;--and I feel sure that you are mistaken. We will leave it\nso, and go to this matter of importance.\" But Clara felt it to be\nvery difficult to tell her tidings after such a conversation as that\nwhich had just occurred. When she had entered the room her mind had\nbeen tuned to the subject, and she could have found fitting words\nwithout much difficulty to herself; but now her thoughts had been\nscattered and her feelings hurt, and she did not know how to bring\nherself back to the subject of her engagement. She paused, therefore,\nand sat with a doubtful, hesitating look, meditating some mode of\nescape. \"I am all ears,\" said Mrs. Askerton; and Clara thought that\nshe discovered something of ridicule or of sarcasm in the tone of her\nfriend's voice.\n\n\"I believe I'll put it off till another day,\" she said.\n\n\"Why so? You don't think that anything really important to you will\nnot be important to me also?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that, but somehow--\"\n\n\"You mean to say that I have ruffled you?\"\n\n\"Well;--perhaps; a little.\"\n\n\"Then be unruffled again, like my own dear, honest Clara. I have been\nruffled too, but I'll be as tranquil now as a drawing-room cat.\" Then\nMrs. Askerton got up from her chair, and seated herself by Clara's\nside on the sofa. \"Come; you can't go till you've told me; and if you\nhesitate, I shall think that you mean to quarrel with me.\"\n\n\"I'll come to you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No, no; you shall tell me to-day. All to-morrow you'll be preparing\nfor your cousin.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\"\n\n\"Or else you'll come prepared to vindicate him, and then we shan't\nget on any further. Tell me what it is to-day. You can't leave me in\ncuriosity after what you have said.\"\n\n\"You've heard of Captain Aylmer, I think.\"\n\n\"Of course I've heard of him.\"\n\n\"But you've never seen him?\"\n\n\"You know I never have.\"\n\n\"I told you that he was at Perivale when Mrs. Winterfield died.\"\n\n\"And now he has proposed, and you are going to accept him? That will\nindeed be important. Is it so?--say. But don't I know it is so? Why\ndon't you speak?\"\n\n\"If you know it, why need I speak?\"\n\n\"But it is so? Oh, Clara, I am so glad. I congratulate you with all\nmy heart,--with all my heart. My dearest, dearest Clara! What a happy\narrangement! What a success! It is just as it should be. Dear, good\nman! to come forward in that sensible way, and put an end to all the\nlittle family difficulties!\"\n\n\"I don't know so much about success. Who is it that is successful?\"\n\n\"You, to be sure.\"\n\n\"Then by the same measurement he must be unsuccessful.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Clara.\"\n\n\"Of course I have been successful if I've got a man that I can love\nas my husband.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear, don't be a fool. Of course all that is between you and\nhim, and I don't in the least doubt that it is all as it should be.\nIf Captain Aylmer had been the elder brother instead of the younger,\nand had all the Aylmer estates instead of the Perivale property, I\nknow you would not accept him if you did not like him.\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"I am sure you would not. But when a girl with nothing a year has\nmanaged to love a man with two or three thousand a year, and has\nmanaged to be loved by him in return,--instead of going through the\nsame process with the curate or village doctor,--it is a success,\nand her friends will always think so. And when a girl marries a\ngentleman, and a member of Parliament, instead of--; well, I'm not\ngoing to say anything personal,--her friends will congratulate her\nupon his position. It may be very wicked, and mercenary, and all\nthat; but it's the way of the world.\"\n\n\"I hate hearing about the world.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; all proper young ladies like you do hate it. But I\nobserve that such girls as you never offend its prejudices. You can't\nbut know that you would have done a wicked as well as a foolish thing\nto marry a man without an adequate income.\"\n\n\"But I needn't marry at all.\"\n\n\"And what would you live on then? Come Clara, we needn't quarrel\nabout that. I've no doubt he's charming, and beautiful, and--\"\n\n\"He isn't beautiful at all; and as for charming--\"\n\n\"He has charmed you at any rate.\"\n\n\"He has made me believe that I can trust him without doubt, and love\nhim without fear.\"\n\n\"An excellent man! And the income will be an additional comfort;\nyou'll allow that?\"\n\n\"I'll allow nothing.\"\n\n\"And when is it to be?\"\n\n\"Oh,--perhaps in six or seven years.\"\n\n\"Clara!\"\n\n\"Perhaps sooner; but there's been no word said about time.\"\n\n\"Is not Mr. Amedroz delighted?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. He quite scolded me when I told him.\"\n\n\"Why;--what did he want?\"\n\n\"You know papa.\"\n\n\"I know he scolds at everything, but I shouldn't have thought he\nwould have scolded at that. And when does he come here?\"\n\n\"Who come here?\"\n\n\"Captain Aylmer.\"\n\n\"I don't know that he is coming at all.\"\n\n\"He must come to be married.\"\n\n\"All that is in the clouds as yet. I did not like to tell you,\nbut you mustn't suppose that because I've told you, everything is\nsettled. Nothing is settled.\"\n\n\"Nothing except the one thing?\"\n\n\"Nothing else.\"\n\nIt was more than an hour after that before Clara went away, and when\nshe did so she was surprised to find that she was followed out of the\nhouse by Colonel Askerton. It was quite dusk at this time, the days\nbeing just at their shortest, and Colonel Askerton, according to his\ncustom, would have been riding, or returning from his ride. Clara\nhad been over two hours at the cottage, and had been aware when she\nreached it that he had not as yet gone out. It appeared now that\nhe had not ridden at all, and, as she remembered to have seen his\nhorse led before the window, it at once occurred to her that he had\nremained at home with the view of catching her as she went away. He\ncame up to her just as she was passing through the gate, and offered\nher his right hand as he raised his hat with his left. It sometimes\nhappens to all of us in life that we become acquainted with persons\nintimately,--that is, with an assumed intimacy,--whom in truth we\ndo not know at all. We meet such persons frequently, often eating\nand drinking in their company, being familiar with their appearance,\nand well-informed generally as to their concerns; but we never find\nourselves holding special conversations with them, or in any way\nfitting the modes of our life to the modes of their life. Accident\nhas brought us together, and in one sense they are our friends. We\nshould probably do any little kindness for them, or expect the same\nfrom them; but there is nothing in common between us, and there is\ngenerally a mutual though unexpressed agreement that there shall\nbe nothing in common. Miss Amedroz was intimately acquainted with\nColonel Askerton after this fashion. She saw him very frequently, and\nhis name was often on her tongue; but she rarely, if ever, conversed\nwith him, and knew of his habits only from his wife's words\nrespecting them. When, therefore, he followed her through the garden\ngate into the park, she was driven to suppose that he had something\nspecial to say to her.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have a dark walk, Miss Amedroz,\" he said.\n\n\"It's only just across the park, and I know the way so well.\"\n\n\"Yes,--of course. I saw you coming out, and as I want to say a word\nor two, I have ventured to follow you. When Mr. Belton was down here\nI did not have the pleasure of meeting him.\"\n\n\"I remember that you missed each other.\"\n\n\"Yes, we did. I understand from my wife that he will be here again in\na day or two.\"\n\n\"He will be with us the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I hope you will excuse my saying that it will be very desirable that\nwe should miss each other again.\" Clara felt that her face became\nred with anger as she listened to Colonel Askerton's words. He spoke\nslowly, as was his custom, and without any of that violence of\nexpression which his wife had used; but on that very account there\nwas more, if possible, of meaning in his words than in hers. William\nBelton was her cousin, and such a speech as that which Colonel\nAskerton had made, spoken with deliberation and unaccompanied by any\nprevious explanation, seemed to her almost to amount to insult. But\nas she did not know how to answer him at the spur of the moment, she\nremained silent. Then he continued, \"You may be sure, Miss Amedroz,\nthat I should not make so strange a request to you if I had not good\nreason for making it.\"\n\n\"I think it a very strange request.\"\n\n\"And nothing but a strong conviction of its propriety on my part\nwould have induced me to make it.\"\n\n\"If you do not want to see my cousin, why cannot you avoid him\nwithout saying anything to me on the subject?\"\n\n\"Because you would not then have understood as thoroughly as I wish\nyou to do why I kept out of his way. For my wife's sake,--and for\nyours, if you will allow me to say so,--I do not wish to come to any\nopen quarrel with him; but if we met, a quarrel would, I think, be\ninevitable. Mary has probably explained to you the nature of his\noffence against us?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton has told me something as to which I am quite sure that\nshe is mistaken.\"\n\n\"I will say nothing about that, as I have no wish at all to set you\nagainst your cousin. I will bid you good-night now as you are close\nat home.\" Then he turned round and left her.\n\nClara, as she thought of all this, could not but call to mind her\ncousin's remembrances about Miss Vigo and Mr. Berdmore. What if he\nmade some inquiry as to the correctness of his old recollections?\nNothing, she thought, could be more natural. And then she reflected\nthat, in the ordinary way of the world, persons feel none of that\nviolent objection to the asking of questions about their antecedents\nwhich was now evinced by both Colonel and Mrs. Askerton. But of\none thing she felt quite assured,--that her cousin, Will Belton,\nwould make no inquiry which he ought not to make; and would make no\nimproper use of any information which he might obtain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE HEIR'S SECOND VISIT TO BELTON.\n\n\nClara began to doubt whether any possible arrangement of the\ncircumstances of her life could be regarded as fortunate. She was\nvery fond, in a different degree and after a different fashion, of\nboth Captain Aylmer and Mr. Belton. As regarded both, her position\nwas now exactly what she herself would have wished. The man that\nshe loved was betrothed to her, and the other man, whom she loved\nindeed also as a brother, was coming to her in that guise,--with the\nunderstanding that that was to be his position. And yet everything\nwas going wrong! Her father, though he did not actually say anything\nagainst Captain Aylmer, showed by a hundred little signs, of which\nhe was a skilful master, that the Aylmer alliance was distasteful to\nhim, and that he thought himself to be aggrieved in that his daughter\nwould not marry her cousin; whereas, over at the cottage, there was\na still more bitter feeling against Mr. Belton--a feeling so bitter,\nthat it almost induced Clara to wish that her cousin was not coming\nto them.\n\nBut the cousin did come, and was driven up to the door in the gig\nfrom Taunton, just as had been the case on his previous visit. Then,\nhowever, he had come in the full daylight, and the hay-carts had been\nabout, and all the prettiness and warmth of summer had been there;\nnow it was mid-winter, and there had been some slight beginnings of\nsnow, and the wind was moaning about the old tower, and the outside\nof the house looked very unpleasant from the hall-door. As it had\nbecome dusk in the afternoon, the old squire had been very careful in\nhis orders as to preparations for Will's comfort,--as though Clara\nwould have forgotten all those things in the preoccupation of her\nmind, caused by the constancy of her thoughts towards Will's rival.\nHe even went so far as to creep across the up-stairs landing-place to\nsee that the fire was lighted in Will's room, this being the first\ntime that he had left his chamber for many days,--and had given\nspecial orders as to the food which was to be prepared for Will's\ndinner,--in a very different spirit from that which had dictated\nsome former orders when Will was about to make his first visit, and\nwhen his coming had been regarded by the old man as a heartless,\nindelicate, and almost hostile proceeding.\n\n\"I wish I could go down to receive him,\" said Mr. Amedroz,\nplaintively. \"I hope he won't take it amiss.\"\n\n\"You may be sure he won't do that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I can to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Dear papa, you had better not think of it till the weather is\nmilder.\"\n\n\"Milder! how is it to get milder at this time of the year?\"\n\n\"Of course he'll come up to you, papa.\"\n\n\"He's very good. I know he's very good. No one else would do as\nmuch.\"\n\nClara understood accurately what all this meant. Of course she was\nglad that her father should feel so kindly towards her cousin, and\nthink so much of his coming; but every word said by the old man\nin praise of Will Belton implied an equal amount of dispraise as\nregarded Captain Aylmer, and contained a reproach against his\ndaughter for having refused the former and accepted the latter.\n\nClara was in the hall when Belton arrived, and received him as he\nentered, enveloped in his damp great-coats. \"It is so good of you to\ncome in such weather,\" she said.\n\n\"Nice seasonable weather, I call it,\" he said. It was the same\ncomfortable, hearty, satisfactory voice which had done so much\ntowards making his way for him on his first arrival at Belton Castle.\nThe voices to which Clara was most accustomed were querulous,--as\nthough the world had been found by the owners of them to be but a bad\nplace. But Belton's voice seemed to speak of cheery days and happy\nfriends, and a general state of things which made life worth having.\nNevertheless, forty-eight hours had not yet passed over his head\nsince he was walking about London in such misery that he had almost\ncursed the hour in which he was born. His misery still remained with\nhim, as black now as it had been then; and yet his voice was cheery.\nThe sick birds, we are told, creep into holes, that they may die\nalone and unnoticed; and the wounded beasts hide themselves that\ntheir grief may not be seen of their fellows. A man has the same\ninstinct to conceal the weakness of his sufferings; but, if he be a\nman, he hides it in his own heart, keeping it for solitude and the\nwatches of the night, while to the outer world he carries a face on\nwhich his care has made no marks.\n\n\"You will be sorry to hear that papa is too ill to come down-stairs.\"\n\n\"Is he, indeed? I am truly sorry. I had heard he was ill; but did not\nknow he was so ill as that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he fancies himself weaker than he is.\"\n\n\"We must try and cure him of that. I can see him, I hope?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes. He is most anxious for you to go to him. As soon as\never you can come up-stairs I will take you.\" He had already stripped\nhimself of his wrappings, and declaring himself ready, at once\nfollowed Clara to the squire's room.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, to find you in this way,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm very poorly, Will;--very,\" said the squire, putting out his\nhand as though he were barely able to lift it above his knee. Now it\ncertainly was the fact that half an hour before he had been walking\nacross the passage.\n\n\"We must see if we can't soon make you better among us,\" said Will.\n\nThe squire shook his head with a slow, melancholy movement, not\nraising his eyes from the ground. \"I don't think you'll ever see me\nmuch better, Will,\" he said. And yet half an hour since he had been\ntalking of being down in the dining-room on the next day. \"I shan't\ntrouble you much longer,\" said the squire. \"You'll soon have it all\nwithout paying rent for it.\"\n\nThis was very unpleasant, and almost frustrated Belton's attempts to\nbe cheery. But he persevered nevertheless. \"It'll be a long time yet\nbefore that day comes, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah; that's easily said. But never mind. Why should I want to remain\nwhen I shall have once seen her properly settled. I've nothing to\nlive for except that she may have a home.\"\n\nOn this subject it was quite impossible that Belton should say\nanything. Clara was standing by him, and she, as he knew, was engaged\nto Captain Aylmer. So circumstanced, what could he say as to Clara's\nsettlement in life? That something should be said between him and the\nold man, and something also between him and Clara, was a matter of\ncourse; but it was quite out of the question that he should discuss\nClara's prospects in life in presence of them both together.\n\n\"Papa's illness makes him a little melancholy,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Of course,--of course. It always does,\" said Will.\n\n\"I think he will be better when the weather becomes milder,\" said\nClara.\n\n\"I suppose I may be allowed to know how I feel myself,\" said the\nsquire. \"But don't keep Will up here when he wants his dinner. There;\nthat'll do. You'd better leave me now.\" Then Will went out to his old\nroom, and a quarter of an hour afterwards he found himself seated\nwith Clara at the dinner-table; and a quarter of an hour after that\nthe dinner was over, and they had both drawn their chairs to the\nfire.\n\nNeither of them knew how to begin with the other. Clara was under no\nobligation to declare her engagement to her cousin, but yet she felt\nthat it would be unhandsome in her not to do so. Had Will never made\nthe mistake of wanting to marry her himself, she would have done so\nas a matter of course. Had she supposed him to cherish any intention\nof renewing that mistake she would have felt herself bound to tell\nhim,--so that he might save himself from unnecessary pain. But she\ngave him credit for no such intention, and yet she could not but\nremember that scene among the rocks. And then was she, or was she\nnot, to say anything to him about the Askertons? With him also the\ndifficulty was as great. He did not in truth believe that the tidings\nwhich he had heard from his friend the lawyer required corroboration;\nbut yet it was necessary that he should know from herself that she\nhad disposed of her hand;--and it was necessary also that he should\nsay some word to her as to their future standing and friendship.\n\n\"You must be very anxious to see how your farm goes on,\" said she.\n\nHe had not thought much of his agricultural venture at Belton for\nthe last three or four days, and would hardly have been vexed had he\nbeen told that every head of cattle about the place had died of the\nmurrain. Some general idea of the expediency of going on with a thing\nwhich he had commenced still actuated him; but it was the principle\ninvolved, and not the speculation itself, which interested him. But\nhe could not explain all this, and he therefore was driven to some\ncold agreement with her. \"The farm!--you mean the stock. Yes; I shall\ngo and have a look at them early to-morrow. I suppose they're all\nalive.\"\n\n\"Pudge says that they are doing uncommonly well.\" Pudge was a leading\nman among the Belton labourers, whom Will had hired to look after his\nconcerns.\n\n\"That's all right. I dare say Pudge knows quite as much about it as I\ndo.\"\n\n\"But the master's eye is everything.\"\n\n\"Pudge's eye is quite as good as mine; and probably much better, as\nhe knows the country.\"\n\n\"You used to say that it was everything for a man to look after his\nown interests.\"\n\n\"And I do look after them. Pudge and I will go and have a look at\nevery beast to-morrow, and I shall look very wise and pretend to know\nmore about it than he does. In stock-farming the chief thing is not\nto have too many beasts. They used to say that half-stocking was\nwhole profit, and whole-stocking was half profit. If the animals have\nplenty to eat, and the rent isn't too high, they'll take care of\ntheir owner.\"\n\n\"But then there is so much illness.\"\n\n\"I always insure.\"\n\nClara perceived that the subject of the cattle didn't suit the\npresent occasion. When he had before been at Belton he had liked\nnothing so much as talking about the cattle-sheds, and the land, and\nthe kind of animals which would suit the place; but now the novelty\nof the thing was gone,--and the farmer did not wish to talk of his\nfarm. In her anxiety to find a topic which would not be painful, she\nwent from the cattle to the cow. \"You can't think what a pet Bessy\nhas been with us. And she seems to think that she is privileged to go\neverywhere, and do anything.\"\n\n\"I hope they have taken care that she has had winter food.\"\n\n\"Winter food! Why Pudge, and all the Pudges, and all the family in\nthe house, and all your cattle would have to want, before Bessy would\nbe allowed to miss a meal. Pudge always says, with his sententious\nshake of the head, that the young squire was very particular about\nBessy.\"\n\n\"Those Alderneys want a little care,--that's all.\"\n\nBessy was of no better service to Clara in her present difficulty\nthan the less aristocratic herd of common cattle. There was a pause\nfor a moment, and then she began again. \"How did you leave your\nsister, Will?\"\n\n\"Much the same as usual. I think she has borne the first of the cold\nweather better than she did last year.\"\n\n\"I do so wish that I knew her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will some day. But I don't suppose that you ever will.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It's not likely that you'll ever come to Plaistow now;--and Mary\nnever leaves it except to go to my uncle's.\"\n\nClara instantly knew that he had heard of her engagement, though\nshe could not imagine from what source he had heard it. There was\nsomething in the tone of his voice,--something especially in the\nexpression of that word \"now,\" which told her that it must be so.\n\"I should be so glad to go there if I could,\" she said, with that\nspecial hypocrisy which belongs to women, and is allowed to them;\n\"but, of course, I cannot leave papa in his present state.\"\n\n\"And if you did leave him you would not go to Plaistow.\"\n\n\"Not unless you and Mary asked me.\"\n\n\"And you wouldn't if we did. How could you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Will? It seems as though you were almost savage to\nme.\"\n\n\"Am I? Well;--I feel savage, but not to you.\"\n\n\"Nor to any one, I hope, belonging to me.\" She knew that it was\nall coming; that the whole subject of her future life must now be\ndiscussed; and she began to fear that the discussion might not be\neasy. But she did not know how to give it a direction. She feared\nthat he would become angry, and yet she knew not why. He had accepted\nhis own rejection tranquilly, and could hardly take it as an offence\nthat she should now be engaged to Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"Mr. Green has told me,\" said he, \"that you are going to be married.\"\n\n\"How could Mr. Green have known?\"\n\n\"He did know;--at least I suppose he knew, for he told me.\"\n\n\"How very odd.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is true?\" Clara did not make any immediate answer, and\nthen he repeated the question. \"I suppose it is true?\"\n\n\"It is true that I am engaged.\"\n\n\"To Captain Aylmer?\"\n\n\"Yes; to Captain Aylmer. You know that I had known him very long. I\nhope that you are not angry with me because I did not write and tell\nyou. Strange as it may seem, seeing that you had heard it already, it\nis not a week yet since it was settled; and had I written to you, I\ncould only have addressed my letter to you here.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about that. I didn't specially want you to write\nto me. What difference would it make?\"\n\n\"But I should have felt that I owed it to your kindness and\nyour--regard for me.\"\n\n\"My regard! What's the use of regard?\"\n\n\"You are not going to quarrel with me, Will,\nbecause--because--because--. If you had really been my brother, as\nyou once said you would be, you could not but have approved of what\nI have done.\"\n\n\"But I am not your brother.\"\n\n\"Oh, Will; that sounds so cruel!\"\n\n\"I am not your brother, and I have no right to approve or\ndisapprove.\"\n\n\"I will not say that I could make my engagement with Captain Aylmer\ndependent on your approval. It would not be fair to him to do so, and\nit would put me into a false position.\"\n\n\"Have I asked you to make any such absurd sacrifice?\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Will. I say that I could not do that. But, short of\nthat, there is nothing I would not do to satisfy you. I think so much\nof your judgment and goodness, and so very much of your affection; I\nlove you so dearly, that--. Oh, Will, say a kind word to me!\"\n\n\"A kind word; yes, but what sort of kindness?\"\n\n\"You must know that Captain Aylmer--\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me of Captain Aylmer. Have I said anything against\nhim? Have I ventured to make any objection? Of course, I know his\nsuperiority to myself. I know that he is a man of the world, and that\nI am not; that he is educated, and that I am ignorant; that he has a\nposition, and that I have none; that he has much to offer, and that I\nhave nothing. Of course, I see the difference; but that does not make\nme comfortable.\"\n\n\"Will, I had learned to love him before I had ever seen you.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me so, that I might have known there was no\nhope, and have gone away utterly,--out of the kingdom? If it was all\nsettled then, why didn't you tell me, and save me from breaking my\nheart with false hopes?\"\n\n\"Nothing was settled then. I hardly knew my own mind; but yet I loved\nhim. There; cannot you understand it? Have I not told you enough?\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand it.\"\n\n\"And do you blame me?\"\n\nHe paused awhile before he answered her. \"No; I do not blame you. I\nsuppose I must blame no one but myself. But you should bear with me.\nI was so happy, and now I am so wretched.\"\n\nThere was nothing that she could say to comfort him. She had\naltogether mistaken the nature of the man's regard, and had even\nmistaken the very nature of the man. So much she now learned, and\ncould tell herself that had she known him better she would either\nhave prevented this second visit, or would have been careful that he\nshould have learned the truth from herself before he came. Now she\ncould only wait till he should again have got strength to hide his\nsuffering under the veil of his own manliness.\n\n\"I have not a word to say against what you are doing,\" he said at\nlast; \"not a word. But you will understand what I mean when I tell\nyou that it is not likely that you will come to Plaistow.\"\n\n\"Some day, Will, when you have a wife of your own--\"\n\n\"Very well; but we won't talk about that at present, if you please.\nWhen I have, things will be different. In the meantime your course\nand mine will be separate. You, I suppose, will be with him in\nLondon, while I shall be,--at the devil as likely as not.\"\n\n\"How can you speak to me in that way? Is that like being my brother?\"\n\n\"I don't feel like being your brother. However, I beg your pardon,\nand now we will have done with it. Spilt milk can't be helped, and\nmy milk pans have got themselves knocked over. That's all. Don't you\nthink we ought to go up to your father again?\"\n\nOn the following day Belton and Mr. Amedroz discussed the same\nsubject, but the conversation went off very quietly. Will was\ndetermined not to exhibit his weakness before the father as he had\ndone before the daughter. When the squire, with a maundering voice,\ndrawled out some expression of regret that his daughter's choice had\nnot fallen in another place, Will was able to say that bygones must\nbe bygones. He regretted it also, but that was now over. And when\nthe squire endeavoured to say a few ill-natured words about Captain\nAylmer, Will stopped him at once by asserting that the Captain was\nall that he ought to be.\n\n\"And it would have made me so happy to think that my daughter's child\nshould come to live in his grandfather's old house,\" murmured Mr.\nAmedroz.\n\n\"And there's no knowing that he mayn't do so yet,\" said Will. \"But\nall these things are so doubtful that a man is wrong to fix his\nhappiness upon them.\" After that he went out to ramble about the\nplace, and before the third day was over Clara was able to perceive\nthat, in spite of what he had said, he was as busy about the cattle\nas though his bread depended on them.\n\nNothing had been said as yet about the Askertons, and Clara had\nresolved that their name should not first be mentioned by her. Mrs.\nAskerton had prophesied that Will would have some communication to\nmake about herself, and Clara would at any rate see whether her\ncousin would, of his own accord, introduce the subject. But three\ndays passed by, and he had made no allusion to the cottage or its\ninhabitants. This in itself was singular, as the Askertons were\nthe only local friends whom Clara knew, and as Belton had become\npersonally acquainted with Mrs. Askerton. But such was the case;\nand when Mr. Amedroz once said something about Mrs. Askerton in the\npresence of both Clara and Belton, they both of them shrank from the\nsubject in a manner that made Clara understand that any conversation\nabout the Askertons was to be avoided. On the fourth day Clara saw\nMrs. Askerton, but then Will Belton's name was not mentioned. There\nwas therefore, among them all, a sense of some mystery which made\nthem uncomfortable, and which seemed to admit of no solution. Clara\nwas more sure than ever that her cousin had made no inquiries that he\nshould not have made, and that he would put no information that he\nmight have to an improper use. But of such certainty on her part she\ncould say nothing.\n\nThree weeks passed by, and it seemed as though Belton's visit were\nto come to an end without any further open trouble. Now and then\nsomething was said about Captain Aylmer; but it was very little, and\nBelton made no further reference to his own feelings. It had come\nto be understood that his visit was to be limited to a month; and\nto both him and Clara the month wore itself away slowly, neither\nof them having much pleasure in the society of the other. The old\nsquire came down-stairs once for an hour or two, and spent the whole\ntime in bitter complaints. Everything was wrong, and everybody was\nill-treating him. Even with Will he quarrelled, or did his best to\nquarrel, in regard to everything about the place, though at the\nsame time he did not cease to grumble at his visitor for going away\nand leaving him. Belton bore it all so well that the grumbling\nand quarrelling did not lead to much; but it required all his\ngood-humour and broad common sense to prevent serious troubles and\nmisunderstanding.\n\nDuring the period of her cousin's visit at Belton, Clara received two\nletters from Captain Aylmer, who was spending the Christmas holidays\nwith his father and mother, and on the day previous to that of her\ncousin's departure there came a third. In neither of these letters\nwas there much said about Sir Anthony, but they were all very full\nof Lady Aylmer. In the first he wrote with something of the personal\nenthusiasm of a lover, and therefore Clara hardly felt the little\ndrawbacks to her happiness which were contained in certain innuendoes\nrespecting Lady Aylmer's ideas, and Lady Aylmer's hopes, and Lady\nAylmer's fears. Clara was not going to marry Lady Aylmer, and did not\nfear but that she could hold her own against any mother-in-law in\nthe world when once they should be brought face to face. And as long\nas Captain Aylmer seemed to take her part rather than that of his\nmother it was all very well. The second letter was more trying to\nher temper, as it contained one or two small morsels of advice as to\nconduct which had evidently originated with her ladyship. Now there\nis nothing, I take it, so irritating to an engaged young lady as\ncounsel from her intended husband's mamma. An engaged young lady, if\nshe be really in love, will take almost anything from her lover as\nlong as she is sure that it comes altogether from himself. He may\ntake what liberties he pleases with her dress. He may prescribe high\nchurch or low church,--if he be not, as is generally the case, in\na condition to accept, rather than to give, prescriptions on that\nsubject. He may order almost any course of reading,--providing that\nhe supply the books. And he may even interfere with the style of\ndancing, and recommend or prohibit partners. But he may not thrust\nhis mother down his future wife's throat. In answer to the second\nletter, Clara did not say much to show her sense of objection. Indeed\nshe said nothing. But in saying nothing she showed her objection,\nand Captain Aylmer understood it. Then came the third letter, and\nas it contained matter touching upon our story, it shall be given\nentire,--and I hope it may be taken by gentlemen about to marry as a\nfair specimen of the sort of letter they ought not to write to the\ngirls of their hearts:--\n\n\n   Aylmer Castle, 19th January, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST CLARA,--I got your letter of the 16th yesterday,\n   and was sorry you said nothing in reference to my mother's\n   ideas as to the house at Perivale. Of course she knew that\n   I heard from you, and was disappointed when I was obliged\n   to tell her that you had not alluded to the subject. She\n   is very anxious about you, and, having now given her\n   assent to our marriage, is of course desirous of knowing\n   that her kindly feeling is reciprocated. I assured her\n   that my own Clara was the last person to be remiss in such\n   a matter, and reminded her that young ladies are seldom\n   very careful in their mode of answering letters. Remember,\n   therefore, that I am now your guarantee, and send some\n   message to relieve me from my liability.\n\n   When I told her of your father's long illness, which she\n   laments greatly, and of your cousin's continued presence\n   at Belton Castle, she seemed to think that Mr. Belton's\n   visit should not be prolonged. When I told her that he was\n   your nearest relative, she remarked that cousins are the\n   same as any other people,--which indeed they are. I know\n   that my Clara will not suppose that I mean more by this\n   than the words convey. Indeed I mean less. But not having\n   the advantage of a mother of your own, you will not be\n   sorry to know what are my mother's opinions on matters\n   which so nearly concern you.\n\n   And now I come to another subject, as to which what I\n   shall say will surprise you very much. You know, I think,\n   that my aunt Winterfield and I had some conversation about\n   your neighbours, the Askertons; and you will remember\n   that my aunt, whose ideas on such matters were always\n   correct, was a little afraid that your father had not\n   made sufficient inquiry respecting them before he allowed\n   them to settle near him as tenants. It now turns out that\n   she is,--very far, indeed, from what she ought to be. My\n   mother at first thought of writing to you about this; but\n   she is a little fatigued, and at last resolved that under\n   all the circumstances it might be as well that I should\n   tell you. It seems that Mrs. Askerton was married before\n   to a certain Captain Berdmore, and that she left her\n   first husband during his lifetime under the protection\n   of Colonel Askerton. I believe they, the Colonel and\n   Mrs. Askerton, have been since married. Captain Berdmore\n   died about four years ago in India, and it is probable\n   that such a marriage has taken place. But under these\n   circumstances, as Lady Aylmer says, you will at once\n   perceive that all acquaintance between you and the lady\n   should be brought to an end. Indeed, your own sense of\n   what is becoming to you, either as an unmarried girl or as\n   my future wife, or indeed as a woman at all, will at once\n   make you feel that this must be so. I think, if I were\n   you, I would tell the whole to Mr. Amedroz; but this I\n   will leave to your own discretion. I can assure you that\n   Lady Aylmer has full proof as to the truth of what I tell\n   you.\n\n   I go up to London in February. I suppose I may hardly hope\n   to see you before the recess in July or August; but I\n   trust that before that we shall have fixed the day when\n   you will make me the happiest of men.\n\n   Yours, with truest affection,\n\n   F. F. AYLMER.\n\n\nIt was a disagreeable, nasty letter from the first line to the last.\nThere was not a word in it which did not grate against Clara's\nfeelings,--not a thought expressed which did not give rise to fears\nas to her future happiness. But the information which it contained\nabout the Askertons,--\"the communication,\" as Mrs. Askerton herself\nwould have called it,--made her for the moment almost forget Lady\nAylmer and her insolence. Could this story be true? And if true, how\nfar would it be imperative on her to take the hint, or rather obey\nthe order which had been given her? What steps should she take to\nlearn the truth? Then she remembered Mrs. Askerton's promise--\"If you\nwant to ask any questions, and will ask them of me, I will answer\nthem.\" The communication, as to which Mrs. Askerton had prophesied,\nhad now been made;--but it had been made, not by Will Belton, whom\nMrs. Askerton had reviled, but by Captain Aylmer, whose praises Mrs.\nAskerton had so loudly sung. As Clara thought of this, she could not\nanalyse her own feelings, which were not devoid of a certain triumph.\nShe had known that Belton would not put on his armour to attack a\nwoman. Captain Aylmer had done so, and she was hardly surprised at\nhis doing it. Yet Captain Aylmer was the man she loved! Captain\nAylmer was the man she had promised to marry. But, in truth, she\nhardly knew which was the man she loved!\n\nThis letter came on a Sunday morning, and on that day she and Belton\nwent to church together. On the following morning early he was to\nstart for Taunton. At church they saw Mrs. Askerton, whose attendance\nthere was not very frequent. It seemed, indeed, as though she had\ncome with the express purpose of seeing Belton once during his visit.\nAs they left the church she bowed to him, and that was all they saw\nof each other throughout the month that he remained in Somersetshire.\n\n\"Come to me to-morrow, Clara,\" Mrs. Askerton said as they all passed\nthrough the village together. Clara muttered some reply, having not\nas yet made up her mind as to what her conduct must be. Early on the\nnext morning Will Belton went away, and again Clara got up to give\nhim his breakfast. On this occasion he had no thought of kissing\nher. He went away without having had a word said to him about\nMrs. Askerton, and then Clara settled herself down to the work of\ndeliberation. What should she do with reference to the communication\nthat had been made to her by Captain Aylmer?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nAYLMER PARK.\n\n\nAylmer Park and the great house of the Aylmers together formed an\nimportant, and, as regarded in some minds, an imposing country\nresidence. The park was large, including some three or four hundred\nacres, and was peopled, rather thinly, by aristocratic deer. It\nwas surrounded by an aristocratic paling, and was entered, at three\ndifferent points, by aristocratic lodges. The sheep were more\nnumerous than the deer, because Sir Anthony, though he had a large\nincome, was not in very easy circumstances. The ground was quite\nflat; and though there were thin belts of trees, and some ornamental\ntimber here and there, it was not well wooded. It had no special\nbeauty of its own, and depended for its imposing qualities chiefly\non its size, on its three sets of double lodges, and on its\nold-established character as an important family place in the county.\nThe house was of stone, with a portico of Ionic columns which looked\nas though it hardly belonged of right to the edifice, and stretched\nitself out grandly, with two pretentious wings, which certainly gave\nit a just claim to be called a mansion. It required a great many\nservants to keep it in order, and the numerous servants required an\nexperienced duenna, almost as grand in appearance as Lady Aylmer\nherself, to keep them in order. There was an open carriage and a\nclose carriage, and a butler, and two footmen, and three gamekeepers,\nand four gardeners, and there was a coachman, and there were grooms,\nand sundry inferior men and boys about the place to do the work\nwhich the gardeners and gamekeepers and grooms did not choose to\ndo themselves. And they all became fat, and lazy, and stupid, and\nrespectable together; so that, as the reader will at once perceive,\nAylmer Park was kept up in the proper English style. Sir Anthony\nvery often discussed with his steward the propriety of lessening the\nexpenditure of his residence, and Lady Aylmer always attended and\nprobably directed these discussions; but it was found that nothing\ncould be done. Any attempt to remove a gamekeeper or a gardener would\nevidently throw the whole machinery of Aylmer Park out of gear. If\nretrenchment was necessary Aylmer Park must be abandoned, and the\nglory of the Aylmers must be allowed to pale. But things were not so\nbad as that with Sir Anthony. The gardeners, grooms, and gamekeepers\nwere maintained; ten domestic servants sat down to four heavy meals\nin the servants' hall every day, and Lady Aylmer contented herself\nwith receiving little or no company, and with stingy breakfasts and\nbad dinners for herself and her husband and daughter. By all this it\nmust be seen that she did her duty as the wife of an English country\ngentleman, and properly maintained his rank as a baronet.\n\nHe was a heavy man, over seventy years of age, much afflicted with\ngout, and given to no pursuit on earth which was available for\nhis comfort. He had been a hunting man, and he had shot also; but\nnot with that energy which induces a sportsman to carry on those\namusements in opposition to the impediments of age. He had been, and\nstill was, a county magistrate; but he had never been very successful\nin the justice-room, and now seldom troubled the county with his\njudicial incompetence. He had been fond of good dinners and good\nwine, and still, on occasions, would make attempts at enjoyment in\nthat line; but the gout and Lady Aylmer together were too many for\nhim, and he had but small opportunity for filling up the blanks of\nhis existence out of the kitchen or cellar. He was a big man, with\na broad chest, and a red face, and a quantity of white hair,--and\nwas much given to abusing his servants. He took some pleasure in\nstanding, with two sticks on the top of the steps before his own\nfront door, and railing at any one who came in his way. But he could\nnot do this when Lady Aylmer was by; and his dependents, knowing his\nhabits, had fallen into an ill-natured way of deserting the side of\nthe house which he frequented. With his eldest son, Anthony Aylmer,\nhe was not on very good terms; and though there was no positive\nquarrel, the heir did not often come to Aylmer Park. Of his son\nFrederic he was proud,--and the best days of his life were probably\nthose which Captain Aylmer spent at the house. The table was then\nsomewhat more generously spread, and this was an excuse for having\nup the special port in which he delighted. Altogether his life was\nnot very attractive; and though he had been born to a baronetcy, and\neight thousand a-year, and the possession of Aylmer Park, I do not\nthink that he was, or had been, a happy man.\n\nLady Aylmer was more fortunate. She had occupations of which her\nhusband knew nothing, and for which he was altogether unfit. Though\nshe could not succeed in making retrenchments, she could and did\nsucceed in keeping the household books. Sir Anthony could only blow\nup the servants when they were thoughtless enough to come in his way,\nand in doing that was restricted by his wife's presence. But Lady\nAylmer could get at them day and night. She had no gout to impede\nher progress about the house and grounds, and could make her way to\nplaces which the master never saw; and then she wrote many letters\ndaily, whereas Sir Anthony hardly ever took a pen in his hand. And\nshe knew the cottages of all the poor about the place, and knew also\nall their sins of omission and commission. She was driven out, too,\nevery day, summer and winter, wet and dry, and consumed enormous\npackets of wool and worsted, which were sent to her monthly from\nYork. And she had a companion in her daughter, whereas Sir Anthony\nhad no companion. Wherever Lady Aylmer went Miss Aylmer went with\nher, and relieved what might otherwise have been the tedium of her\nlife. She had been a beauty on a large scale, and was still aware\nthat she had much in her personal appearance which justified pride.\nShe carried herself uprightly, with a commanding nose and broad\nforehead; and though the graces of her own hair had given way to\na front, there was something even in the front which added to her\ndignity, if it did not make her a handsome woman.\n\nMiss Aylmer, who was the eldest of the younger generation, and who\nwas now gently descending from her fortieth year, lacked the strength\nof her mother's character, but admired her mother's ways, and\nfollowed Lady Aylmer in all things,--at a distance. She was very\ngood,--as indeed was Lady Aylmer,--entertaining a high idea of duty,\nand aware that her own life admitted of but little self-indulgence.\nShe had no pleasures, she incurred no expenses; and was quite\nalive to the fact that as Aylmer Park required a regiment of lazy,\ngormandizing servants to maintain its position in the county, the\nAylmers themselves should not be lazy, and should not gormandize. No\none was more careful with her few shillings than Miss Aylmer. She\nhad, indeed, abandoned a life's correspondence with an old friend\nbecause she would not pay the postage on letters to Italy. She knew\nthat it was for the honour of the family that one of her brothers\nshould sit in Parliament, and was quite willing to deny herself a\nnew dress because sacrifices must be made to lessen electioneering\nexpenses. She knew that it was her lot to be driven about slowly in a\ncarriage with a livery servant before her and another behind her, and\nthen eat a dinner which the cook-maid would despise. She was aware\nthat it was her duty to be snubbed by her mother, and to encounter\nher father's ill-temper, and to submit to her brother's indifference,\nand to have, so to say, the slightest possible modicum of personal\nindividuality. She knew that she had never attracted a man's love,\nand might hardly hope to make friends for the comfort of her coming\nage. But still she was contented, and felt that she had consolation\nfor it all in the fact that she was an Aylmer. She read many novels,\nand it cannot but be supposed that something of regret would steal\nover her as she remembered that nothing of the romance of life had\never, or could ever, come in her way. She wept over the loves of many\nwomen, though she had never been happy or unhappy in her own. She\nread of gaiety, though she never encountered it, and must have known\nthat the world elsewhere was less dull than it was at Aylmer Park.\nBut she took her life as it came, without a complaint, and prayed\nthat God would make her humble in the high position to which it had\npleased Him to call her. She hated Radicals, and thought that Essays\nand Reviews, and Bishop Colenso, came direct from the Evil One. She\ntaught the little children in the parish, being specially urgent to\nthem always to curtsey when they saw any of the family;--and was as\nignorant, meek, and stupid a poor woman as you shall find anywhere in\nEurope.\n\nIt may be imagined that Captain Aylmer, who knew the comforts of his\nclub and was accustomed to life in London, would feel the dulness\nof the paternal roof to be almost unendurable. In truth, he was not\nvery fond of Aylmer Park, but he was more gifted with patience than\nmost men of his age and position, and was aware that it behoved him\nto keep the Fifth Commandment if he expected to have his own days\nprolonged in the land. He therefore made his visits periodically,\nand contented himself with clipping a few days at both ends from the\nlength prescribed by family tradition, which his mother was desirous\nof exacting. September was always to be passed at Aylmer Park,\nbecause of the shooting. In September, indeed, the eldest son himself\nwas wont to be there,--probably with a friend or two,--and the fat\nold servants bestirred themselves, and there was something of life\nabout the place. At Christmas, Captain Aylmer was there as the\nonly visitor, and Christmas was supposed to extend from the middle\nof December to the opening of Parliament. It must, however, be\nexplained, that on the present occasion his visit had been a matter\nof treaty and compromise. He had not gone to Aylmer Park at all till\nhis mother had in some sort assented to his marriage with Clara\nAmedroz. To this Lady Aylmer had been very averse, and there had been\nmany serious letters. Belinda Aylmer, the daughter of the house, had\nhad a bad time in pleading her brother's cause,--and some very harsh\nwords had been uttered;--but ultimately the matter had been arranged,\nand, as is usual in such contests, the mother had yielded to the son.\nCaptain Aylmer had therefore gone down a few days before Christmas,\nwith a righteous feeling that he owed much to his mother for her\ncondescension, and almost prepared to make himself very disagreeable\nto Clara by way of atoning to his family for his folly in desiring to\nmarry her.\n\nLady Aylmer was very plain-spoken on the subject of all Clara's\nshortcomings,--very plain-spoken, and very inquisitive. \"She will\nnever have one shilling, I suppose?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" Captain Aylmer always called his mother ma'am. \"She\nwill have that fifteen hundred pounds that I told you of.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you will have back the money which you yourself have\ngiven her, Fred. I suppose that is the English of it?\" Then Lady\nAylmer raised her eyebrows and looked very wise.\n\n\"Just so, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You can't call that having anything of her own. In point of fact she\nis penniless.\"\n\n\"It is no good harping on that,\" said Captain Aylmer, somewhat\nsharply.\n\n\"Not in the least, my dear; no good at all. Of course you have looked\nit all in the face. You will be a poor man instead of a rich man, but\nyou will have enough to live on,--that is if she doesn't have a large\nfamily;--which of course she will.\"\n\n\"I shall do very well, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You might do pretty well, I dare say, if you could live\nprivately,--at Perivale, keeping up the old family house there, and\nhaving no expenses; but you'll find even that close enough with your\nseat in Parliament, and the necessity there is that you should be\nhalf the year in London. Of course she won't go to London. She can't\nexpect it. All that had better be made quite clear at once.\" Hence\nhad come the letter about the house at Perivale, containing Lady\nAylmer's advice on that subject, as to which Clara made no reply.\n\nLady Aylmer, though she had given in her assent, was still not\naltogether without hope. It might be possible that the two young\npeople could be brought to see the folly and error of their ways\nbefore it would be too late; and that Lady Aylmer, by a judicious\ncourse of constant advice, might be instrumental in opening the eyes,\nif not of the lady, at any rate of the gentleman. She had great\nreliance on her own powers, and knew well that a falling drop will\nhollow a stone. Her son manifested no hot eagerness to complete his\nfolly in a hurry, and to cut the throat of his prospects out of hand.\nTime, therefore, would be allowed to her, and she was a woman who\ncould use time with patience. Having, through her son, despatched her\nadvice about the house at Perivale,--which simply amounted to this,\nthat Clara should expressly state her willingness to live there alone\nwhenever it might suit her husband to be in London or elsewhere,--she\nwent to work on other points connected with the Amedroz family, and\neventually succeeded in learning something very much like the truth\nas to poor Mrs. Askerton and her troubles. At first she was so\ncomfortably horror-stricken by the iniquity she had unravelled,--so\ndelightfully shocked and astounded,--as to believe that the facts as\nthey then stood would suffice to annul the match.\n\n\"You don't tell me,\" she said to Belinda, \"that Frederic's wife\nwill have been the friend of such a woman as that!\" And Lady Aylmer,\nsitting up-stairs with her household books before her, put up her\ngreat fat hands and her great fat arms, and shook her head,--front\nand all,--in most satisfactory dismay.\n\n\"But I suppose Clara did not know it.\" Belinda had considered it to\nbe an act of charity to call Miss Amedroz Clara since the family\nconsent had been given.\n\n\"Didn't know it! They have been living in that sort of way that they\nmust have been confidantes in everything. Besides, I always hold that\na woman is responsible for her female friends.\"\n\n\"I think if she consents to drop her at once,--that is, absolutely\nto make a promise that she will never speak to her again,--Frederic\nought to take that as sufficient. That is, of course, mamma, unless\nshe has had anything to do with it herself.\"\n\n\"After this I don't know how I'm to trust her. I don't indeed. It\nseems to me that she has been so artful throughout. It has been a\nregular case of catching.\"\n\n\"I suppose, of course, that she has been anxious to marry\nFrederic;--but perhaps that was natural.\"\n\n\"Anxious;--look at her going there just when he had to meet his\nconstituents. How young women can do such things passes me! And how\nit is that men don't see it all, when it's going on just under their\nnoses, I can't understand. And then her getting my poor dear sister\nto speak to him when she was dying! I didn't think your aunt would\nhave been so weak.\" It will be thus seen that there was entire\nconfidence on this subject between Lady Aylmer and her daughter.\n\nWe know what were the steps taken with reference to the discovery,\nand how the family were waiting for Clara's reply. Lady Aylmer,\nthough in her words she attributed so much mean cunning to Miss\nAmedroz, still was disposed to believe that that lady would show\nrather a high spirit on this occasion; and trusted to that high\nspirit as the means for making the breach which she still hoped to\naccomplish. It had been intended,--or rather desired,--that Captain\nAylmer's letter should have been much sharper and authoritative than\nhe had really made it; but the mother could not write the letter\nherself, and had felt that to write in her own name would not have\nserved to create anger on Clara's part against her betrothed. But\nshe had quite succeeded in inspiring her son with a feeling of\nhorror against the iniquity of the Askertons. He was prepared to be\nindignantly moral; and perhaps,--perhaps,--the misguided Clara might\nbe silly enough to say a word for her lost friend! Such being the\npresent position of affairs, there was certainly ground for hope.\n\nAnd now they were all waiting for Clara's answer. Lady Aylmer had\nwell calculated the course of post, and knew that a letter might\nreach them by Wednesday morning. \"Of course she will not write on\nSunday,\" she had said to her son, \"but you have a right to expect\nthat not another day should go by.\" Captain Aylmer, who felt that\nthey were putting Clara on her trial, shook his head impatiently,\nand made no immediate answer. Lady Aylmer, triumphantly feeling that\nshe had the culprit on the hip, did not care to notice this. She was\ndoing the best she could for his happiness,--as she had done for\nhis health, when in days gone by she had administered to him his\ninfantine rhubarb and early senna; but as she had never then expected\nhim to like her doses, neither did she now expect that he should\nbe well pleased at the remedial measures to which he was to be\nsubjected.\n\nNo letter came on the Wednesday, nor did any come on the Thursday,\nand then it was thought by the ladies at the Park that the time had\ncome for speaking a word or two. Belinda, at her mother's instance,\nbegan the attack,--not in her mother's presence, but when she only\nwas with her brother.\n\n\"Isn't it odd, Frederic, that Clara shouldn't write about those\npeople at Belton?\"\n\n\"Somersetshire is the other side of London, and letters take a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"But if she had written on Monday, her answer would have been here on\nWednesday morning;--indeed, you would have had it Tuesday evening,\nas mamma sent over to Whitby for the day mail letters.\" Poor Belinda\nwas a bad lieutenant, and displayed too much of her senior officer's\ntactics in thus showing how much calculation and how much solicitude\nthere had been as to the expected letter.\n\n\"If I am contented I suppose you may be,\" said the brother.\n\n\"But it does seem to me to be so very important! If she hasn't got\nyour letter, you know, it would be so necessary that you should write\nagain, so that the--the--the contamination should be stopped as\nsoon as possible.\" Captain Aylmer shook his head and walked away.\nHe was, no doubt, prepared to be morally indignant,--morally very\nindignant,--at the Askerton iniquity; but he did not like the word\ncontamination as applied to his future wife.\n\n\"Frederic,\" said his mother, later on the same day,--when the\nhardly-used groom had returned from his futile afternoon's inquiry at\nthe neighbouring post-town,--\"I think you should do something in this\naffair.\"\n\n\"Do what, ma'am? Go off to Belton myself?\"\n\n\"No, no. I certainly would not do that. In the first place it would\nbe very inconvenient to you, and in the next place it would not be\nfair upon us. I did not mean that at all. But I think that something\nshould be done. She should be made to understand.\"\n\n\"You may be sure, ma'am, that she understands as well as anybody.\"\n\n\"I dare say she is clever enough at these kind of things.\"\n\n\"What kind of things?\"\n\n\"Don't bite my nose off, Frederic, because I am anxious about your\nwife.\"\n\n\"What is it that you wish me to do? I have written to her, and can\nonly wait for her answer.\"\n\n\"It may be that she feels a delicacy in writing to you on such a\nsubject; though I own--. However, to make a long story short, if you\nlike, I will write to her myself.\"\n\n\"I don't see that that would do any good. It would only give her\noffence.\"\n\n\"Give her offence, Frederic, to receive a letter from her future\nmother-in-law;--from me! Only think, Frederic, what you are saying.\"\n\n\"If she thought she was being bullied about this, she would turn\nrusty at once.\"\n\n\"Turn rusty! What am I to think of a young lady who is prepared\nto turn rusty,--at once, too, because she is cautioned by the\nmother of the man she professes to love against an improper\nacquaintance,--against an acquaintance so very improper?\" Lady\nAylmer's eloquence should have been heard to be appreciated. It is\nbut tame to say that she raised her fat arms and fat hands, and\nwagged her front,--her front that was the more formidable as it was\nthe old one, somewhat rough and dishevelled, which she was wont to\nwear in the morning. The emphasis of her words should have been\nheard, and the fitting solemnity of her action should have been seen.\n\"If there were any doubt,\" she continued to say, \"but there is no\ndoubt. There are the damning proofs.\" There are certain words usually\nconfined to the vocabularies of men, which women such as Lady Aylmer\ndelight to use on special occasions, when strong circumstances demand\nstrong language. As she said this she put her hand below the table,\npressing it apparently against her own august person; but she was in\ntruth indicating the position of a certain valuable correspondence,\nwhich was locked up in the drawer of her writing-table.\n\n\"You can write if you like it, of course; but I think you ought to\nwait a few more days.\"\n\n\"Very well, Frederic; then I will wait. I will wait till Sunday. I do\nnot wish to take any step of which you do not approve. If you have\nnot heard by Sunday morning, then I will write to her--on Monday.\"\n\nOn the Saturday afternoon life was becoming inexpressibly\ndisagreeable to Captain Aylmer, and he began to meditate an escape\nfrom the Park. In spite of the agreement between him and his mother,\nwhich he understood to signify that nothing more was to be said as\nto Clara's wickedness, at any rate till Sunday after post-hour, Lady\nAylmer had twice attacked him on the Saturday, and had expressed her\nopinion that affairs were in a very frightful position. Belinda went\nabout the house in melancholy guise, with her eyes rarely lifted off\nthe ground, as though she were prophetically weeping the utter ruin\nof her brother's respectability. And even Sir Anthony had raised\nhis eyes and shaken his head, when, on opening the post-bag at the\nbreakfast-table,--an operation which was always performed by Lady\nAylmer in person,--her ladyship had exclaimed, \"Again no letter!\"\nThen Captain Aylmer thought that he would fly, and resolved that,\nin the event of such flight, he would give special orders as to the\nre-direction of his own letters from the post-office at Whitby.\n\nThat evening, after dinner, as soon as his mother and sister had left\nthe room, he began the subject with his father. \"I think I shall go\nup to town on Monday, sir,\" said he.\n\n\"So soon as that. I thought you were to stop till the 9th.\"\n\n\"There are things I must see to in London, and I believe I had better\ngo at once.\"\n\n\"Your mother will be greatly disappointed.\"\n\n\"I shall be sorry for that;--but business is business, you know.\"\nThen the father filled his glass and passed the bottle. He himself\ndid not at all like the idea of his son's going before the appointed\ntime, but he did not say a word of himself. He looked at the red-hot\ncoals, and a hazy glimmer of a thought passed through his mind, that\nhe too would escape from Aylmer Park,--if it were possible.\n\n\"If you'll allow me, I'll take the dog-cart over to Whitby on Monday,\nfor the express train.\"\n\n\"You can do that certainly, but--\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Have you spoken to your mother yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I will to-night.\"\n\n\"I think she'll be a little angry, Fred.\" There was a sudden tone of\nsubdued confidence in the old man's voice as he made this suggestion,\nwhich, though it was by no means a customary tone, his son well\nunderstood. \"Don't you think she will be;--eh, a little?\"\n\n\"She shouldn't go on as she does with me about Clara,\" said the\nCaptain.\n\n\"Ah,--I supposed there was something of that. Are you drinking port?\"\n\n\"Of course I know that she means all that is good,\" said the son,\npassing back the bottle.\n\n\"Oh yes;--she means all that is good.\"\n\n\"She is the best mother in the world.\"\n\n\"You may say that, Fred;--and the best wife.\"\n\n\"But if she can't have her own way altogether--\" Then the son paused,\nand the father shook his head.\n\n\"Of course she likes to have her own way,\" said Sir Anthony.\n\n\"It's all very well in some things.\"\n\n\"Yes;--it's very well in some things.\"\n\n\"But there are things which a man must decide for himself.\"\n\n\"I suppose there are,\" said Sir Anthony, not venturing to think what\nthose things might be as regarded himself.\n\n\"Now, with reference to marrying--\"\n\n\"I don't know what you want with marrying at all, Fred. You ought to\nbe very happy as you are. By heavens, I don't know any one who ought\nto be happier. If I were you, I know--\"\n\n\"But you see, sir, that's all settled.\"\n\n\"If it's all settled, I suppose there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"It's no good my mother nagging at one.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, she's been nagging at me, as you call it, for forty\nyears. That's her way. The best woman in the world, as we were\nsaying;--but that's her way. And it's the way with most of them. They\ncan do anything if they keep it up;--anything. The best thing is to\nbear it if you've got it to bear. But why on earth you should go and\nmarry, seeing that you're not the eldest son, and that you've got\neverything on earth that you want as a bachelor, I can't understand.\nI can't indeed, Fred. By heaven, I can't!\" Then Sir Anthony gave a\nlong sigh, and sat musing awhile, thinking of the club in London to\nwhich he belonged, but which he never entered;--of the old days in\nwhich he had been master of a bedroom near St. James's Street,--of\nhis old friends whom he never saw now, and of whom he never heard,\nexcept as one and another, year after year, shuffled away from their\nwives to that world in which there is no marrying or giving in\nmarriage. \"Ah, well,\" he said, \"I suppose we may as well go into\nthe drawing-room. If it is settled, I suppose it is settled. But it\nreally seems to me that your mother is trying to do the best she can\nfor you. It really does.\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer did not say anything to his mother that night as to\nhis going, but as he thought of his prospects in the solitude of his\nbedroom, he felt really grateful to his father for the solicitude\nwhich Sir Anthony had displayed on his behalf. It was not often\nthat he received paternal counsel, but now that it had come he\nacknowledged its value. That Clara Amedroz was a self-willed woman he\nthought that he was aware. She was self-reliant, at any rate,--and by\nno means ready to succumb with that pretty feminine docility which he\nwould like to have seen her evince. He certainly would not wish to be\n\"nagged\" by his wife. Indeed he knew himself well enough to assure\nhimself that he would not stand it for a day. In his own house he\nwould be master, and if there came tempests he would rule them. He\ncould at least promise himself that. As his mother had been strong,\nso had his father been weak. But he had,--as he felt thankful in\nknowing,--inherited his mother's strength rather than his father's\nweakness. But, for all that, why have a tempest to rule at all? Even\nthough a man do rule his domestic tempests, he cannot have a very\nquiet house with them. Then again he remembered how very easily Clara\nhad been won. He wished to be just to all men and women, and to Clara\namong the number. He desired even to be generous to her,--with a\nmoderate generosity. But above all things he desired not to be duped.\nWhat if Clara had in truth instigated her aunt to that deathbed\nscene, as his mother had more than once suggested! He did not believe\nit. He was sure that it had not been so. But what if it were so? His\ndesire to be generous and trusting was moderate;--but his desire not\nto be cheated, not to be deceived, was immoderate. Upon the whole\nmight it not be well for him to wait a little longer, and ascertain\nhow Clara really intended to behave herself in this emergency of the\nAskertons? Perhaps, after all, his mother might be right.\n\nOn the Sunday the expected letter came;--but before its contents are\nmade known, it will be well that we should go back to Belton, and see\nwhat was done by Clara in reference to the tidings which her lover\nhad sent her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nMRS. ASKERTON'S STORY.\n\n\nWhen Clara received the letter from Captain Aylmer on which so much\nis supposed to hang, she made up her mind to say nothing of it to any\none,--not to think of it if she could avoid thinking of it,--till her\ncousin should have left her. She could not mention it to him; for,\nthough there was no one from whom she would sooner have asked advice\nthan from him, even on so delicate a matter as this, she could not do\nso in the present case, as her informant was her cousin's successful\nrival. When, therefore, Mrs. Askerton on leaving the church had\nspoken some customary word to Clara, begging her to come to the\ncottage on the following day, Clara had been unable to answer,--not\nhaving as yet made up her mind whether she would or would not go\nto the cottage again. Of course the idea of consulting her father\noccurred to her,--or rather the idea of telling him; but any such\ntelling would lead to some advice from him which she would find\nit difficult to obey, and to which she would be unable to trust.\nAnd, moreover, why should she repeat this evil story against her\nneighbours?\n\nShe had a long morning by herself after Will had started, and then\nshe endeavoured to arrange her thoughts and lay down for herself a\nline of conduct. Presuming this story to be true, to what did it\namount? It certainly amounted to very much. If, in truth, this woman\nhad left her own husband and gone away to live with another man, she\nhad by doing so,--at any rate while she was doing so,--fallen in such\na way as to make herself unfit for the society of an unmarried young\nwoman who meant to keep her name unblemished before the world. Clara\nwould not attempt any further unravelling of the case, even in her\nown mind;--but on that point she could not allow herself to have a\ndoubt. Without condemning the unhappy victim, she understood well\nthat she would owe it to all those who held her dear, if not to\nherself, to eschew any close intimacy with one in such a position.\nThe rules of the world were too plainly written to allow her to guide\nherself by any special judgment of her own in such a matter. But\nif this friend of hers,--having been thus unfortunate,--had since\nredeemed, or in part redeemed, her position by a second marriage,\nwould it be then imperative upon her to remember the past for ever,\nand to declare that the stain was indelible? Clara felt that with a\nprevious knowledge of such a story she would probably have avoided\nany intimacy with Mrs. Askerton. She would then have been justified\nin choosing whether such intimacy should or should not exist, and\nwould so have chosen out of deference to the world's opinion. But\nnow it was too late for that. Mrs. Askerton had for years been her\nfriend; and Clara had to ask herself _this_ question; was it now\nneedful,--did her own feminine purity demand,--that she should throw\nher friend over because in past years her life had been tainted by\nmisconduct.\n\nIt was clear enough at any rate that this was expected from\nher,--nay, imperatively demanded by him who was to be her lord,--by\nhim to whom her future obedience would be due. Whatever might be her\nimmediate decision, he would have a right to call upon her to be\nguided by his judgment as soon as she would become his wife. And\nindeed, she felt that he had such right now,--unless she should\ndecide that no such right should be his, now or ever. It was still\nwithin her power to say that she could not submit herself to such a\nrule as his,--but having received his commands she must do that or\nobey them. Then she declared to herself, not following the matter out\nlogically, but urged to her decision by sudden impulse, that at any\nrate she would not obey Lady Aylmer. She would have nothing to do, in\nany such matter, with Lady Aylmer. Lady Aylmer should be no god to\nher. That question about the house at Perivale had been very painful\nto her. She felt that she could have endured the dreary solitude at\nPerivale without complaint, if, after her marriage, her husband's\ncircumstances had made such a mode of living expedient. But to have\nbeen asked to pledge her consent to such a life before her marriage,\nto feel that he was bargaining for the privilege of being rid of\nher, to know that the Aylmer people were arranging that he, if he\nwould marry her, should be as little troubled with his wife as\npossible;--all this had been very grievous to her. She had tried\nto console herself by the conviction that Lady Aylmer,--not\nFrederic,--had been the sinner; but even in that consolation there\nhad been the terrible flaw that the words had come to her written by\nFrederic's hand. Could Will Belton have written such a letter to his\nfuture wife?\n\nIn her present emergency she must be guided by her own judgment or\nher own instincts,--not by any edicts from Aylmer Park! If in what\nshe might do she should encounter the condemnation of Captain Aylmer,\nshe would answer him,--she would be driven to answer him,--by\ncounter-condemnation of him and his mother. Let it be so. Anything\nwould be better than a mean, truckling subservience to the imperious\nmistress of Aylmer Park.\n\nBut what should she do as regarded Mrs. Askerton? That the story was\ntrue she was beginning to believe. That there was some such history\nwas made certain to her by the promise which Mrs. Askerton had given\nher.\n\n\"If you want to ask any questions, and will ask them of me, I will\nanswer them.\" Such a promise would not have been volunteered unless\nthere was something special to be told. It would be best, perhaps, to\ndemand from Mrs. Askerton the fulfilment of this promise. But then\nin doing so she must own from whence her information had come. Mrs.\nAskerton had told her that the \"communication\" would be made by her\ncousin Will. Her cousin Will had gone away without a word of Mrs.\nAskerton, and now the \"communication\" had come from Captain Aylmer!\n\nThe Monday and Tuesday were rainy days, and the rain was some excuse\nfor her not going to the cottage. On the Wednesday her father was\nill, and his illness made a further excuse for her remaining at home.\nBut on the Wednesday evening there came a note to her from Mrs.\nAskerton. \"You naughty girl, why do you not come to me? Colonel\nAskerton has been away since yesterday morning, and I am forgetting\nthe sound of my own voice. I did not trouble you when your divine\ncousin was here,--for reasons; but unless you come to me now I\nshall think that his divinity has prevailed. Colonel Askerton is in\nIreland, about some property, and will not be back till next week.\"\n\nClara sent back a promise by the messenger, and on the following\nmorning she put on her hat and shawl, and started on her dreaded\ntask. When she left the house she had not even yet quite made up her\nmind what she would do. At first she put her lover's letter into\nher pocket, so that she might have it for reference; but, on second\nthoughts, she replaced it in her desk, dreading lest she might be\npersuaded into showing or reading some part of it. There had come a\nsharp frost after the rain, and the ground was hard and dry. In order\nthat she might gain some further last moment for thinking, she walked\nround, up among the rocks, instead of going straight to the cottage;\nand for a moment,--though the air was sharp with frost,--she sat upon\nthe stone where she had been seated when her cousin Will blurted out\nthe misfortune of his heart. She sat there on purpose that she might\nthink of him, and recall his figure, and the tones of his voice, and\nthe look of his eyes, and the gesture of his face. What a man he\nwas;--so tender, yet so strong; so thoughtful of others, and yet so\nself-sufficient! She had, unconsciously, imputed to him one fault,\nthat he had loved and then forgotten his love;--unconsciously,\nfor she had tried to think that this was a virtue rather than a\nfault;--but now,--with a full knowledge of what she was doing, but\nwithout any intention of doing it,--she acquitted him of that one\nfault. Now that she could acquit him, she owned that it would have\nbeen a fault. To have loved, and so soon to have forgotten it! No; he\nhad loved her truly, and alas! he was one who could not be made to\nforget it. Then she went on to the cottage, exercising her thoughts\nrather on the contrast between the two men than on the subject to\nwhich she should have applied them.\n\n\"So you have come at last!\" said Mrs. Askerton. \"Till I got your\nmessage I thought there was to be some dreadful misfortune.\"\n\n\"What misfortune?\"\n\n\"Something dreadful! One often anticipates something very bad without\nexactly knowing what. At least, I do. I am always expecting a\ncatastrophe;--when I am alone that is;--and then I am so often\nalone.\"\n\n\"That simply means low spirits, I suppose?\"\n\n\"It's more than that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Not much more, I take it.\"\n\n\"Once when we were in India we lived close to the powder magazine,\nand we were always expecting to be blown up. You never lived near a\npowder magazine.\"\n\n\"No, never;--unless there's one at Belton. But I should have thought\nthat was exciting.\"\n\n\"And then there was the gentleman who always had the sword hanging\nover him by the horse's hair.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Mrs. Askerton?\"\n\n\"Don't look so innocent, Clara. You know what I mean. What were the\nresults at last of your cousin's diligence as a detective officer?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton, you wrong my cousin greatly. He never once mentioned\nyour name while he was with us. He did not make a single allusion to\nyou, or to Colonel Askerton, or to the cottage.\"\n\n\"He did not?\"\n\n\"Never once.\"\n\n\"Then I beg his pardon. But not the less has he been busy making\ninquiries.\"\n\n\"But why should you say that there is a powder magazine, or a sword\nhanging over your head?\"\n\n\"Ah, why?\"\n\nHere was the subject ready opened to her hand, and yet Clara did not\nknow how to go on with it. It seemed to her now that it would have\nbeen easier for her to commence it, if Mrs. Askerton had made no\ncommencement herself. As it was, she knew not how to introduce the\nsubject of Captain Aylmer's letter, and was almost inclined to wait,\nthinking that Mrs. Askerton might tell her own story without any such\nintroduction. But nothing of the kind was forthcoming. Mrs. Askerton\nbegan to talk of the frost, and then went on to abuse Ireland,\ncomplaining of the hardship her husband endured in being forced to go\nthither in winter to look after his tenants.\n\n\"What did you mean,\" said Clara, at last, \"by the sword hanging over\nyour head?\"\n\n\"I think I told you what I meant pretty plainly. If you did not\nunderstand me I cannot tell you more plainly.\"\n\n\"It is odd that you should say so much, and not wish to say more.\"\n\n\"Ah!--you are making your inquiries now.\"\n\n\"In my place would not you do so too? How can I help it when you\ntalked of a sword? Of course you make me ask what the sword is.\"\n\n\"And am I bound to satisfy your curiosity?\"\n\n\"You told me, just before my cousin came here, that if I asked any\nquestion you would answer me.\"\n\n\"And I am to understand that you are asking such a question now?\"\n\n\"Yes;--if it will not offend you.\"\n\n\"But what if it will offend me,--offend me greatly? Who likes to be\ninquired into?\"\n\n\"But you courted such inquiry from me.\"\n\n\"No, Clara, I did not do that. I'll tell you what I did. I gave you\nto understand that if it was needful that you should hear about\nme and my antecedents,--certain matters as to which Mr. Belton\nhad been inquiring into in a manner that I thought to be most\nunjustifiable,--I would tell you that story.\"\n\n\"And do so without being angry with me for asking.\"\n\n\"I meant, of course, that I would not make it a ground for\nquarrelling with you. If I wished to tell you I could do so without\nany inquiry.\"\n\n\"I have sometimes thought that you did wish to tell me.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I have,--almost.\"\n\n\"But you have no such wish now?\"\n\n\"Can't you understand? It may well be that one so much alone as\nI am,--living here without a female friend, or even acquaintance,\nexcept yourself,--should often feel a longing for that comfort which\nfull confidence between us would give me.\"\n\n\"Then why not--\"\n\n\"Stop a moment. Can't you understand that I may feel this, and yet\nentertain the greatest horror against inquiry? We all like to tell\nour own sorrows, but who likes to be inquired into? Many a woman\nburns to make a full confession, who would be as mute as death before\na policeman.\"\n\n\"I am no policeman.\"\n\n\"But you are determined to ask a policeman's questions?\"\n\nTo this Clara made no immediate reply. She felt that she was acting\nalmost falsely in going on with such questions, while she was in fact\naware of all the circumstances which Mrs. Askerton could tell;--but\nshe did not know how to declare her knowledge and to explain it. She\nsincerely wished that Mrs. Askerton should be made acquainted with\nthe truth; but she had fallen into a line of conversation which did\nnot make her own task easy. But the idea of her own hypocrisy was\ndistressing to her, and she rushed at the difficulty with hurried,\neager words, resolving that, at any rate, there should be no longer\nany doubt between them.\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton,\" she said, \"I know it all. There is nothing for you\nto tell. I know what the sword is.\"\n\n\"What is it that you know?\"\n\n\"That you were married long ago to--Mr. Berdmore.\"\n\n\"Then Mr. Belton did do me the honour of talking about me when he was\nhere?\" As she said this she rose from her chair, and stood before\nClara with flashing eyes.\n\n\"Not a word. He never mentioned your name, or the name of any one\nbelonging to you. I have heard it from another.\"\n\n\"From what other?\"\n\n\"I do not know that that signifies,--but I have learned it.\"\n\n\"Well;--and what next?\"\n\n\"I do not know what next. As so much has been told me, and as you\nhad said that I might ask you, I have come to you, yourself. I shall\nbelieve your own story more thoroughly from yourself than from any\nother teller.\"\n\n\"And suppose I refuse to answer you?\"\n\n\"Then I can say nothing further.\"\n\n\"And what will you do?\"\n\n\"Ah;--that I do not know. But you are harsh to me, while I am longing\nto be kind to you. Can you not see that this has been all forced upon\nme,--partly by yourself?\"\n\n\"And the other part;--who has forced that upon you? Who is your\ninformant? If you mean to be generous, be generous altogether. Is it\na man or a woman that has taken the trouble to rip up old sorrows\nthat my name may be blackened? But what matters? There;--I was\nmarried to Captain Berdmore. I left him, and went away with my\npresent husband. For three years I was a man's mistress, and not\nhis wife. When that poor creature died we were married, and then\ncame here. Now you know it all;--all;--all,--though doubtless your\ninformant has made a better story of it. After that, perhaps, I have\nbeen very wicked to sully the air you breathe by my presence.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that,--to me?\"\n\n\"But no;--you do not know it all. No one can ever know it all. No one\ncan ever know how I suffered before I was driven to escape, or how\ngood to me has been he who--who--who--\" Then she turned her back upon\nClara, and, walking off to the window, stood there, hiding the tears\nwhich clouded her eyes, and concealing the sobs which choked her\nutterance.\n\nFor some moments,--for a space which seemed long to both of\nthem,--Clara kept her seat in silence. She hardly dared to speak, and\nthough she longed to show her sympathy, she knew not what to say. At\nlast she too rose and followed the other to the window. She uttered\nno words, however, but gently putting her arm around Mrs. Askerton's\nwaist, stood there close to her, looking out upon the cold wintry\nflower-beds,--not venturing to turn her eyes upon her companion. The\nmotion of her arm was at first very gentle, but after a while she\npressed it closer, and thus by degrees drew her friend to her with an\neager, warm, and enduring pressure. Mrs. Askerton made some little\neffort towards repelling her, some faint motion of resistance; but\nas the embrace became warmer the poor woman yielded herself to it,\nand allowed her face to fall upon Clara's shoulder. So they stood,\nspeaking no word, making no attempt to rid themselves of the tears\nwhich were blinding their eyes, but gazing out through the moisture\non the bleak wintry scene before them. Clara's mind was the more\nactive at the moment, for she was resolving that in this episode\nof her life she would accept no lesson whatever from Lady Aylmer's\nteaching;--no, nor any lesson whatever from the teaching of any\nAylmer in existence. And as for the world's rules, she would fit\nherself to them as best she could; but no such fitting should drive\nher to the unwomanly cruelty of deserting this woman whom she had\nknown and loved,--and whom she now loved with a fervour which she had\nnever before felt towards her.\n\n\"You have heard it all now,\" said Mrs. Askerton at last.\n\n\"And is it not better so?\"\n\n\"Ah;--I do not know. How should I know?\"\n\n\"Do you not know?\" And as she spoke Clara pressed her arm still\ncloser. \"Do you not know yet?\" Then, turning herself half round, she\nclasped the other woman full in her arms, and kissed her forehead and\nher lips.\n\n\"Do you not know yet?\"\n\n\"But you will go away, and people will tell you that you are wrong.\"\n\n\"What people?\" said Clara, thinking as she spoke of the whole family\nat Aylmer Park.\n\n\"Your husband will tell you so.\"\n\n\"I have no husband,--as yet,--to order me what to think or what not\nto think.\"\n\n\"No;--not quite as yet. But you will tell him all this.\"\n\n\"He knows it. It was he who told me.\"\n\n\"What!--Captain Aylmer?\"\n\n\"Yes; Captain Aylmer.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"Never mind. Captain Aylmer is not my husband,--not as yet. If he\ntakes me, he must take me as I am, not as he might possibly have\nwished me to be. Lady Aylmer--\"\n\n\"And does Lady Aylmer know it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Lady Aylmer is one of those hard, severe women who never\nforgive.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see it all now. I understand it all. Clara, you must forget\nme, and come here no more. You shall not be ruined because you are\ngenerous.\"\n\n\"Ruined! If Lady Aylmer's displeasure can ruin me, I must put up with\nruin. I will not accept her for my guide. I am too old, and have had\nmy own way too long. Do not let that thought trouble you. In this\nmatter I shall judge for myself. I have judged for myself already.\"\n\n\"And your father?\"\n\n\"Papa knows nothing of it.\"\n\n\"But you will tell him?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Poor papa is very ill. If he were well I would tell\nhim, and he would think as I do.\"\n\n\"And your cousin?\"\n\n\"You say that he has heard it all.\"\n\n\"I think so. Do you know that I remembered him the first moment that\nI saw him. But what could I do? When you mentioned to me my old name,\nmy real name, how could I be honest? I have been driven to do that\nwhich has made honesty to me impossible. My life has been a lie; and\nyet how could I help it? I must live somewhere,--and how could I live\nanywhere without deceit?\"\n\n\"And yet that is so sad.\"\n\n\"Sad indeed! But what could I do? Of course I was wrong in the\nbeginning. Though how am I to regret it, when it has given me such a\nhusband as I have? Ah!--if you could know it all, I think,--I think\nyou would forgive me.\"\n\nThen by degrees she told it all, and Clara was there for hours\nlistening to her story. The reader will not care to hear more of\nit than he has heard. Nor would Clara have desired any closer\nrevelation; but as it is often difficult to obtain a confidence,\nso is it impossible to stop it in the midst of its effusion. Mrs.\nAskerton told the history of her life,--of her first foolish\nengagement, her belief, her half-belief, in the man's reformation, of\nthe miseries which resulted from his vices, of her escape and shame,\nof her welcome widowhood, and of her second marriage. And as she told\nit, she paused at every point to insist on the goodness of him who\nwas now her husband. \"I shall tell him this,\" she said at last, \"as\nI do everything; and then he will know that I have in truth got a\nfriend.\"\n\nShe asked again and again about Mr. Belton, but Clara could only tell\nher that she knew nothing of her cousin's knowledge. Will might have\nheard it all, but if so he had kept his information to himself.\n\n\"And now what shall you do?\" Mrs. Askerton asked of Clara, at length\nprepared to go.\n\n\"Do? in what way? I shall do nothing.\"\n\n\"But you will write to Captain Aylmer?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I shall write to him.\"\n\n\"And about this?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I suppose I must write to him.\"\n\n\"And what will you say?\"\n\n\"That I cannot tell. I wish I knew what to say. If it were to his\nmother I could write my letter easily enough.\"\n\n\"And what would you say to her?\"\n\n\"I would tell her that I was responsible for my own friends. But I\nmust go now. Papa will complain that I am so long away.\" Then there\nwas another embrace, and at last Clara found her way out of the house\nand was alone again in the park.\n\nShe clearly acknowledged to herself that she had a great difficulty\nbefore her. She had committed herself altogether to Mrs. Askerton,\nand could no longer entertain any thought of obeying the very plainly\nexpressed commands which Captain Aylmer had given her. The story as\ntold by Captain Aylmer had been true throughout; but, in the teeth\nof that truth, she intended to maintain her acquaintance with Mrs.\nAskerton. From that there was now no escape. She had been carried\naway by impulse in what she had done and said at the cottage, but\nshe could not bring herself to regret it. She could not believe that\nit was her duty to throw over and abandon a woman whom she loved,\nbecause that woman had once, in her dire extremity, fallen away from\nthe path of virtue. But how was she to write the letter?\n\nWhen she reached her father he complained of her absence, and almost\nscolded her for having been so long at the cottage. \"I cannot see,\"\nsaid he, \"what you find in that woman to make so much of her.\"\n\n\"She is the only neighbour I have, papa.\"\n\n\"And better none than her, if all that people say of her is true.\"\n\n\"All that people say is never true, papa.\"\n\n\"There is no smoke without fire. I am not at all sure that it's good\nfor you to be so much with her.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa,--don't treat me like a child.\"\n\n\"And I'm sure it's not good for me that you should be so much away.\nFor anything I have seen of you all day you might have been at\nPerivale. But you are going soon, altogether, so I suppose I may as\nwell make up my mind to it.\"\n\n\"I'm not going for a long time yet, papa.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean that there's nothing to take me away from here at present.\"\n\n\"You are engaged to be married.\"\n\n\"But it will be a long engagement. It is one of those engagements in\nwhich neither party is very anxious for an immediate change.\" There\nwas something bitter in Clara's tone as she said this, which the old\nman perceived, but could only half understand. Clara remained with\nhim then for the rest of the day, going down-stairs for five minutes,\nto her dinner, and then returning to him and reading aloud while he\ndozed. Her winter evenings at Belton Castle were not very bright, but\nshe was used to them and made no complaint.\n\nWhen she left her father for the night she got out her desk and\nprepared herself for her letter to her lover. She was determined\nthat it should be finished that night before she went to bed. And it\nwas so finished; though the writing of it gave her much labour, and\noccupied her till the late hours had come upon her. When completed it\nwas as follows:--\n\n\n   Belton Castle, Thursday Night.\n\n   DEAR FREDERIC,--I received your letter last Sunday,\n   but I could not answer it sooner, as it required much\n   consideration, and also some information which I have only\n   obtained to-day. About the plan of living at Perivale I\n   will not say much now, as my mind is so full of other\n   things. I think, however, I may promise that I will never\n   make any needless difficulty as to your plans. My cousin\n   Will left us on Monday, so your mother need not have any\n   further anxiety on that head. It does papa good to have\n   him here, and for that reason I am sorry that he has gone.\n   I can assure you that I don't think what you said about\n   him meant anything at all particular. Will is my nearest\n   cousin, and of course you would be glad that I should like\n   him,--which I do, very much.\n\n   And now about the other subject, which I own has\n   distressed me, as you supposed it would;--I mean about\n   Mrs. Askerton. I find it very difficult in your letter to\n   divide what comes from your mother and what from yourself.\n   Of course I want to make the division, as every word from\n   you has great weight with me. At present I don't know Lady\n   Aylmer personally, and I cannot think of her as I do of\n   you. Indeed, were I to know her ever so well, I could not\n   have the same deference for her that I have for the man\n   who is to be my husband. I only say this, as I fear that\n   Lady Aylmer and I may not perhaps agree about Mrs.\n   Askerton.\n\n   I find that your story about Mrs. Askerton is in the main\n   true. But the person who told it you does not seem to have\n   known any of the provocations which she received. She\n   was very badly treated by Captain Berdmore, who, I am\n   afraid, was a terrible drunkard; and at last she found it\n   impossible to stay with him. So she went away. I cannot\n   tell you how horrid it all was, but I am sure that if I\n   could make you understand it, it would go a long way in\n   inducing you to excuse her. She was married to Colonel\n   Askerton as soon as Captain Berdmore died, and this took\n   place before she came to Belton. I hope you will remember\n   that. It all occurred out in India, and I really hardly\n   know what business we have to inquire about it now.\n\n   At any rate, as I have been acquainted with her a long\n   time, and very intimately, and as I am sure that she has\n   repented of anything that has been wrong, I do not think\n   that I ought to quarrel with her now. Indeed I have\n   promised her that I will not. I think I owe it you to tell\n   you the whole truth, and that is the truth.\n\n   Pray give my regards to your mother, and tell her that\n   I am sure she would judge differently if she were in my\n   place. This poor woman has no other friend here; and who\n   am I, that I should take upon myself to condemn her? I\n   cannot do it. Dear Frederic, pray do not be angry with\n   me for asserting my own will in this matter. I think\n   you would wish me to have an opinion of my own. In my\n   present position I am bound to have one, as I am, as yet,\n   responsible for what I do myself. I shall be very, very\n   sorry, if I find that you differ from me; but still I\n   cannot be made to think that I am wrong. I wish you were\n   here, that we might talk it over together, as I think that\n   in that case you would agree with me.\n\n   If you can manage to come to us at Easter, or any other\n   time when Parliament does not keep you in London, we shall\n   be so delighted to see you.\n\n   Dear Frederic,\n   Yours very affectionately,\n\n   CLARA AMEDROZ.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nMISS AMEDROZ HAS ANOTHER CHANCE.\n\n\nIt was on a Sunday morning that Clara's letter reached Aylmer Park,\nand Frederic Aylmer found it on his plate as he took his place at the\nbreakfast-table. Domestic habits at Aylmer Park had grown with the\ngrowth of years till they had become adamantine, and domestic habits\nrequired prayers every morning at a quarter before nine o'clock.\nAt twenty minutes before nine Lady Aylmer would always be in the\ndining-room to make the tea and open the post-bag, and as she was\nalways there alone, she knew more about other people's letters than\nother people ever knew about hers. When these operations were over\nshe rang the bell, and the servants of the family, who by that time\nhad already formed themselves into line in the hall, would march\nin, and settle themselves on benches prepared for them near the\nside-board,--which benches were afterwards carried away by the\nretiring procession. Lady Aylmer herself always read prayers, as Sir\nAnthony never appeared till the middle of breakfast. Belinda would\nusually come down in a scurry as she heard her mother's bell, in such\na way as to put the army in the hall to some confusion; but Frederic\nAylmer, when he was at home, rarely entered the room till after the\nservice was over. At Perivale no doubt he was more strict in his\nconduct; but then at Perivale he had special interests and influences\nwhich were wanting to him at Aylmer Park. During those five minutes\nLady Aylmer would deal round the letters to the several plates of the\ninmates of her house,--not without looking at the post-office marks\nupon them; and on this occasion she had dealt a letter from Clara to\nher son.\n\nThe arrival of the letter was announced to Frederic Aylmer before he\ntook his seat.\n\n\"Frederic,\" said her ladyship, in her most portentous voice, \"I am\nglad to say that at last there is a letter from Belton.\"\n\nHe made no immediate reply, but making his way slowly to his place,\ntook up the little packet, turned it over in his hand, and then put\nit into his pocket. Having done this, he began very slowly with his\ntea and egg. For three minutes his mother was contented to make,\nor to pretend to make, some effort in the same direction. Then her\nimpatience became too much for her, and she began to question him.\n\n\"Will you not read it, Frederic?\"\n\n\"Of course I shall, ma'am.\"\n\n\"But why not do so now, when you know how anxious we are?\"\n\n\"There are letters which one would sooner read in private.\"\n\n\"But when a matter is of so much importance--\" said Belinda.\n\n\"The importance, Bel, is to me, and not to you,\" said her brother.\n\n\"All we want to know is,\" continued the sister, \"that she promises\nto be guided by you in this matter; and of course we feel quite sure\nthat she will.\"\n\n\"If you are quite sure that must be sufficient for you.\"\n\n\"I really think you need not quarrel with your sister,\" said Lady\nAylmer, \"because she is anxious as to the--the respectability, I must\nsay, for there is no other word, of a young lady whom you propose to\nmake your wife. I can assure you that I am very anxious myself,--very\nanxious indeed.\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer made no answer to this, but he did not take the letter\nfrom his pocket. He drank his tea in silence, and in silence sent\nup his cup to be refilled. In silence also was it returned to him.\nHe ate his two eggs and his three bits of toast, according to his\ncustom, and when he had finished, sat out his three or four minutes\nas was usual. Then he got up to retire to his room, with the envelope\nstill unbroken in his pocket.\n\n\"You will go to church with us, I suppose?\" said Lady Aylmer.\n\n\"I won't promise, ma'am; but if I do, I'll walk across the park,--so\nthat you need not wait for me.\"\n\nThen both the mother and sister knew that the member for Perivale did\nnot intend to go to church on that occasion. To morning service Sir\nAnthony always went, the habits of Aylmer Park having in them more of\nadamant in reference to him than they had as regarded his son.\n\nWhen the father, mother, and daughter returned, Captain Aylmer had\nread his letter, and had, after doing so, received further tidings\nfrom Belton Castle,--further tidings which for the moment prevented\nthe necessity of any reference to the letter, and almost drove it\nfrom his own thoughts. When his mother entered the library he was\nstanding before the fire with a scrap of paper in his hand.\n\n\"Since you have been at church there has come a telegraphic message,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"What is it, Frederic? Do not frighten me,--if you can avoid it!\"\n\n\"You need not be frightened, ma'am, for you did not know him. Mr.\nAmedroz is dead.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Lady Aylmer, seating herself.\n\n\"Dead!\" said Belinda, holding up her hands.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" said the baronet, who had now followed the\nladies into the room. \"Dead! Why, Fred, he was five years younger\nthan I am!\"\n\nThen Captain Aylmer read the words of the message:--\"Mr. Amedroz died\nthis morning at five o'clock. I have sent word to the lawyer and to\nMr. Belton.\"\n\n\"Who does it come from?\" asked Lady Aylmer.\n\n\"From Colonel Askerton.\"\n\nLady Aylmer paused, and shook her head, and moved her foot uneasily\nupon the carpet. The tidings, as far as they went, might be\nunexceptionable, but the source from whence they had come had\nevidently polluted them in her ladyship's judgment. Then she uttered\na series of inter-ejaculations, expressions of mingled sorrow and\nanger.\n\n\"There was no one else near her,\" said Captain Aylmer,\napologetically.\n\n\"Is there no clergyman in the parish?\"\n\n\"He lives a long way off. The message had to be sent at once.\"\n\n\"Are there no servants in the house? It looks,--it looks--. But I\nam the last person in the world to form a harsh judgment of a young\nwoman at such a moment as this. What did she say in her letter,\nFred?\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer had devoted two hours of consideration to the letter\nbefore the telegram had come to relieve his mind by a fresh subject,\nand in those two hours he had not been able to extract much of\ncomfort out of the document. It was, as he felt, a stubborn,\nstiff-necked, disobedient, almost rebellious letter. It contained\na manifest defiance of his mother, and exhibited doctrines of most\nquestionable morality. It had become to him a matter of doubt whether\nhe could possibly marry a woman who could entertain such ideas and\nwrite such a letter. If the doubt was to be decided in his own mind\nagainst Clara, he had better show the letter at once to his mother,\nand allow her ladyship to fight the battle for him;--a task which,\nas he well knew, her ladyship would not be slow to undertake. But he\nhad not succeeded in answering the question satisfactorily to himself\nwhen the telegram arrived and diverted all his thoughts. Now that Mr.\nAmedroz was dead, the whole thing might be different. Clara would\ncome away from Belton and Mrs. Askerton, and begin life, as it were,\nafresh. It seemed as though in such an emergency she ought to have\nanother chance; and therefore he did not hasten to pronounce his\njudgment. Lady Aylmer also felt something of this, and forbore to\npress her question when it was not answered.\n\n\"She will have to leave Belton now, I suppose?\" said Sir Anthony.\n\n\"The property will belong to a distant cousin,--a Mr. William\nBelton.\"\n\n\"And where will she go?\" said Lady Aylmer. \"I suppose she has no\nplace that she can call her home?\"\n\n\"Would it not be a good thing to ask her here?\" said Belinda. Such\na question as that was very rash on the part of Miss Aylmer. In the\nfirst place, the selection of guests for Aylmer Park was rarely left\nto her; and in this special case she should have understood that such\na proposal should have been fully considered by Lady Aylmer before it\nreached Frederic's ears.\n\n\"I think it would be a very good plan,\" said Captain Aylmer,\ngenerously.\n\nLady Aylmer shook her head. \"I should like much to know what she has\nsaid about that unfortunate connection before I offer to take her by\nthe hand myself. I'm sure Fred will feel that I ought to do so.\"\n\nBut Fred retreated from the room without showing the letter. He\nretreated from the room and betook himself to solitude, that he might\nagain endeavour to make up his mind as to what he would do. He put\non his hat and his great-coat and gloves, and went off,--without\nhis luncheon,--that he might consider it all. Clara Amedroz had now\nno home,--and, indeed, very little means of providing one. If he\nintended that she should be his wife, he must furnish her with a home\nat once. It seemed to him that three houses might possibly be open to\nher,--of which one, the only one which under such circumstances would\nbe proper, was Aylmer Park. The other two were Plaistow Hall and Mrs.\nAskerton's cottage at Belton. As to the latter,--should she ever take\nshelter there, everything must be over between him and her. On that\npoint there could be no doubt. He could not bring himself to marry\na wife out of Mrs. Askerton's drawing-room, nor could he expect his\nmother to receive a young woman brought into the family under such\ncircumstances. And Plaistow Hall was almost as bad. It was as bad to\nhim, though it would, perhaps, be less objectionable in the eyes of\nLady Aylmer. Should Clara go to Plaistow Hall there must be an end to\neverything. Of that also he taught himself to be quite certain. Then\nhe took out Clara's letter and read it again. She acknowledged the\nstory about the woman to be true,--such a story as it was too,--and\nyet refused to quarrel with the woman;--had absolutely promised the\nwoman not to quarrel with her! Then he read and re-read the passage\nin which Clara claimed the right of forming her own opinion in such\nmatters. Nothing could be more indelicate;--nothing more unfit for\nhis wife. He began to think that he had better show the letter to\nhis mother, and acknowledge that the match must be broken off. That\nsoftening of his heart which had followed upon the receipt of the\ntelegraphic message departed from him as he dwelt upon the stubborn,\nstiff-necked, unfeminine obstinacy of the letter. Then he remembered\nthat nothing had as yet been done towards putting his aunt's fifteen\nhundred pounds absolutely into Clara's hands; and he remembered also\nthat she might at the present moment be in great want. William Belton\nmight, not improbably, assist her in her want, and this idea was\nwormwood to him in spite of his almost formed resolution to give up\nhis own claims. He calculated that the income arising from fifteen\nhundred pounds would be very small, and he wished that he had\ncounselled his aunt to double the legacy. He thought very much\nabout the amount of the money and the way in which it might be best\nexpended, and was, after his cold fashion, really solicitous as to\nClara's welfare. If he could have fashioned her future life, and his\nown too, in accordance with his own now existing wishes, I think he\nwould have arranged that neither of them should marry at all, and\nthat to him should be assigned the duty and care of being Clara's\nprotector,--with full permission to tell her his mind as often as he\npleased on the subject of Mrs. Askerton. Then he went in and wrote\na note to Mr. Green, the lawyer, desiring that the interest of the\nfifteen hundred pounds for one year might be at once remitted to Miss\nAmedroz. He knew that he ought to write to her himself immediately,\nwithout loss of a post; but how was he to write while things were\nin their present position? Were he now to condole with her on her\nfather's death, without any reference to the great Askerton iniquity,\nhe would thereby be condoning all that was past, and acknowledging\nthe truth and propriety of her arguments. And he would be doing even\nworse than that. He would be cutting the ground absolutely from\nbeneath his own feet as regarded that escape from his engagement\nwhich he was contemplating.\n\nWhat a cold-hearted, ungenerous wretch he must have been! That\nwill be the verdict against him. But the verdict will be untrue.\nCold-hearted and ungenerous he was; but he was no wretch,--as men and\nwomen are now-a-days called wretches. He was chilly hearted, but yet\nquite capable of enough love to make him a good son, a good husband,\nand a good father too. And though he was ungenerous from the nature\nof his temperament, he was not close-fisted or over covetous. And he\nwas a just man, desirous of obtaining nothing that was not fairly his\nown. But, in truth, the artists have been so much in the habit of\npainting for us our friends' faces without any of those flaws and\nblotches with which work and high living are apt to disfigure us,\nthat we turn in disgust from a portrait in which the roughnesses and\npimples are made apparent.\n\nBut it was essential that he should now do something, and before\nhe sat down to dinner he did show Clara's letter to his mother.\n\"Mother,\" he said, as he sat himself down in her little room\nup-stairs;--and she knew well by the tone of his voice, and by\nthe mode of his address, that there was to be a solemn occasion,\nand a serious deliberative council on the present existing family\ndifficulty,--\"mother, of course I have intended to let you know what\nis the nature of Clara's answer to my letter.\"\n\n\"I am glad there is to be no secret between us, Frederic. You know\nhow I dislike secrets in families.\" As she said this she took the\nletter out of her son's hands with an eagerness that was almost\ngreedy. As she read it, he stood over her, watching her eyes, as they\nmade their way down the first page and on to the second, and across\nto the third, and so, gradually on, till the whole reading was\naccomplished. What Clara had written about her cousin Will, Lady\nAylmer did not quite understand; and on this point now she was so\nlittle anxious that she passed over that portion of the letter\nreadily. But when she came to Mrs. Askerton and the allusions to\nherself, she took care to comprehend the meaning and weight of every\nword. \"Divide your words and mine! Why should we want to divide them?\nNot agree with me about Mrs. Askerton! How is it possible that any\ndecent young woman should not agree with me! It is a matter in which\nthere is no room for a doubt. True;--the story true! Of course it\nis true. Does she not know that it would not have reached her from\nAylmer Park if it were not true? Provocation! Badly treated! Went\naway! Married to Colonel Askerton as soon as Captain Berdmore died!\nWhy, Frederic, she cannot have been taught to understand the first\nprinciple of morals in life! And she that was so much with my poor\nsister! Well, well!\" The reader should understand that the late Mrs.\nWinterfield and Lady Aylmer had never been able to agree with each\nother on religious subjects. \"Remember that they are married. Why\nshould we remember anything of the kind? It does not make an atom\nof difference to the woman's character. Repented! How can Clara\nsay whether she has repented or not? But that has nothing to do\nwith it. Not quarrel with her,--as she calls it! Not give her up!\nThen, Frederic, of course it must be all over, as far as you are\nconcerned.\" When she had finished her reading, she returned the\nletter, still open, to her son, shaking her head almost triumphantly.\n\"As far as I am a judge of a young woman's character, I can only give\nyou one counsel,\" said Lady Aylmer solemnly.\n\n\"I think that she should have another chance,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"What other chance can you give her? It seems to me that she is\nobstinately bent on her own destruction.\"\n\n\"You might ask her to come here, as Belinda suggested.\"\n\n\"Belinda was very foolish to suggest anything of the kind without\nmore consideration.\"\n\n\"I suppose that my future wife would be made welcome here?\"\n\n\"Yes, Frederic, certainly. I do not know who could be more welcome.\nBut is she to be your wife?\"\n\n\"We are engaged.\"\n\n\"But does not that letter break any engagement? Is there not enough\nin that to make such a marriage quite out of the question? What do\nyou think about it yourself, Frederic?\"\n\n\"I think that she should have another chance.\"\n\nWhat would Clara have thought of all this herself, if she could have\nheard the conversation between Lady Aylmer and her betrothed husband,\nand have known that her lover was proposing to give her \"another\nchance?\" But it is lucky for us that we seldom know what our best\nfriends say on our behalf, when they discuss us and our faults behind\nour backs.\n\n\"What chance, Frederic, can she have? She knows all about this horrid\nwoman, and yet refuses to give her up! What chance can she have after\nthat?\"\n\n\"I think that you might have her here,--and talk to her.\" Lady\nAylmer, in answer to this, simply shook her head. And I think she was\nright in supposing that such shaking of her head was a sufficient\nreply to her son's proposition. What talking could possibly be of\nservice to such a one as this Miss Amedroz? Why should she throw her\npearls before swine? \"We must either ask her to come here, or else I\nmust go to her,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"I don't see that at all, Frederic.\"\n\n\"I think it must be so. As she is situated at present she has got no\nhome; and I think it would be very horrid that she should be driven\ninto that woman's house, simply because she has no other shelter for\nher head.\"\n\n\"I suppose she can remain where she is for the present?\"\n\n\"She is all alone, you know; and it must be very gloomy;--and her\ncousin can turn her out at a moment's notice.\"\n\n\"But all that would not entitle her to come here, unless--\"\n\n\"No;--I quite understand that. But you cannot wonder that I should\nfeel the hardship of her position.\"\n\n\"Who is to be blamed if it be hard? You see, Frederic, I take my\nstanding upon that letter;--her own letter. How am I to ask a young\nwoman into my house who declares openly that my opinion on such a\nmatter goes for nothing with her? How am I to do it? That's what I\nask you. How am I to do it? It's all very well for Belinda to suggest\nthis and that. But how am I to do it? That's what I want to know.\"\n\nBut at last Lady Aylmer managed to answer the question for herself,\nand did do it. But this was not done on that Sunday afternoon, nor\non the Monday, nor on the Tuesday. The question was closely debated,\nand at last the anxious mother perceived that the giving of the\ninvitation would be more safe than withholding it. Captain Aylmer\nat last expressed his determination to go to Belton unless the\ninvitation were given; and then, should he do that, there might be\ndanger that he would never be again seen at Aylmer Park till he\nbrought Clara Amedroz with him as his wife. The position was one of\ngreat difficulty, but the interests at stake were so immense that\nsomething must be risked. It might be that Clara would not come\nwhen invited, and in that case her obstinacy would be a great point\ngained. And if she did come--! Well; Lady Aylmer admitted to herself\nthat the game would be difficult,--difficult and very troublesome;\nbut yet it might be played, and perhaps won. Lady Aylmer was a woman\nwho had great confidence in herself. Not so utterly had victory in\nsuch contests deserted her hands, that she need fear to break a lance\nwith Miss Amedroz beneath her own roof, when the occasion was so\npressing.\n\nThe invitation was therefore sent in a note written by herself,\nand was enclosed in a letter from her son. After much consultation\nand many doubts on the subject, it was at last agreed that nothing\nfurther should now be urged about Mrs. Askerton. \"She shall have her\nchance,\" said Lady Aylmer over and over again, repeating her son's\nwords. \"She shall have her chance.\" Lady Aylmer, therefore, in her\nnote, confined herself strictly to the giving of the invitation, and\nto a suggestion that, as Clara had now no settled home of her own,\na temporary sojourn at Aylmer Park might be expedient. And Captain\nAylmer in his letter hardly said much more. He knew, as he wrote the\nwords, that they were cold and comfortless, and that he ought on such\nan occasion to have written words that should have been warm at any\nrate, even though they might not have contained comfort. But, to\nhave written with affection, he should have written at once, and he\nhad postponed his letter from the Sunday till the Wednesday. It had\nbeen absolutely necessary that that important question as to the\ninvitation should be answered before he could write at all.\n\nWhen all this was settled he went up to London; and there was an\nunderstanding between him and his mother that he should return\nto Aylmer Park with Clara, in the event of her acceptance of the\ninvitation.\n\n\"You won't go down to Belton for her?\" said the mother.\n\n\"No;--I do not think that will be necessary,\" said the son.\n\n\"I should think not,\" said the mother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nWILLIAM BELTON DOES NOT GO OUT HUNTING.\n\n\nWe will now follow the other message which was sent down into\nNorfolk, and which did not get into Belton's hands till the Monday\nmorning. He was sitting with his sister at breakfast, and was\nprepared for hunting, when the paper was brought into the room.\nTelegraphic messages were not very common at Plaistow Hall, and on\nthe arrival of any that had as yet reached that house, something\nof that awe had been felt with which such missives were always\naccompanied in their earliest days. \"A telegruff message, mum, for\nMr. William,\" said the maid, looking at her mistress with eyes opened\nwide, as she handed the important bit of paper to her master. Will\nopened it rapidly, laying down the knife and fork with which he was\nabout to operate upon a ham before him. He was dressed in boots and\nbreeches, and a scarlet coat,--in which garb he was, in his sister's\neyes, the most handsome man in Norfolk.\n\n\"Oh, Mary!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What is it, Will?\"\n\n\"Mr. Amedroz is dead.\"\n\nMiss Belton put out her hand for the paper before she spoke again, as\nthough she could better appreciate the truth of what she heard when\nreading it herself on the telegraph slip than she had done from her\nbrother's words. \"How sudden! how terribly sudden!\" she said.\n\n\"Sudden indeed. When I left him he was not well, certainly, but I\nshould have said that he might have lived for twenty years. Poor old\nman! I can hardly say why it was so, but I had taken a liking to\nhim.\"\n\n\"You take a liking to everybody, Will.\"\n\n\"No I don't. I know people I don't like.\" Will Belton as he said this\nwas thinking of Captain Aylmer, and he pressed the heel of his boot\nhard against the floor.\n\n\"And Mr. Amedroz is dead! It seems to be so terribly sudden. What\nwill she do, Will?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm thinking about.\"\n\n\"Of course you are, my dear. I can see that. I wish,--I wish--\"\n\n\"It's no good wishing anything, Mary. I don't think wishing ever did\nany good yet. If I might have my wish, I shouldn't know how to have\nit.\"\n\n\"I was wishing that you didn't think so much about it.\"\n\n\"You need not be troubled about me. I shall do very well. But what is\nto become of her,--now at once? Might she not come here? You are now\nthe nearest female relation that she has.\" Mary looked at him with\nher anxious, painful eyes, and he knew by her look that she did not\napprove of his plan. \"I could go away,\" he continued. \"She could come\nto you without being troubled by seeing me.\n\n\"And where would you go, Will?\"\n\n\"What does it matter? To the devil, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, Will, Will!\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. I'd go anywhere. Where is she to find a home\ntill,--till she is married?\" He had paused at the word; but was\ndetermined not to shrink from it, and bolted it out in a loud, sharp\ntone, so that both he and she recognised all the meaning of the\nword,--all that was conveyed in the idea. He hated himself when he\nendeavoured to conceal from his own mind any of the misery that was\ncoming upon him. He loved her. He could not get over it. The passion\nwas on him,--like a palsy, for the shaking off of which no sufficient\nphysical energy was left to him. It clung to him in his goings out\nand comings in with a painful, wearing tenacity, against which he\nwould now and again struggle, swearing that it should be so no\nlonger,--but against which he always struggled in vain. It was with\nhim when he was hunting. He was ever thinking of it when the bird\nrose before his gun. As he watched the furrow, as his men and horses\nwould drive it straight and deep through the ground, he was thinking\nof her,--and not of the straightness and depth of the furrow, as had\nbeen his wont in former years. Then he would turn away his face, and\nstand alone in his field, blinded by the salt drops in his eyes,\nweeping at his own weakness. And when he was quite alone, he would\nstamp his foot on the ground, and throw abroad his arms, and curse\nhimself. What Nessus's shirt was this that had fallen upon him, and\nunmanned him from the sole of his foot to the top of his head? He\nwent through the occupations of the week. He hunted, and shot, and\ngave his orders, and paid his men their wages;--but he did it all\nwith a palsy of love upon him as he did it. He wanted her, and he\ncould not overcome the want. He could not bear to confess to himself\nthat the thing by which he had set so much store could never belong\nto him. His sister understood it all, and sometimes he was almost\nangry with her because of her understanding it. She sympathised with\nhim in all his moods, and sometimes he would shake away her sympathy\nas though it scalded him. \"Where is she to find a home till,--till\nshe is married?\" he said.\n\nNot a word had as yet been said between them about the property which\nwas now his estate. He was now Belton of Belton, and it must be\nsupposed that both he and she had remembered that it was so. But\nhitherto not a word had been said between them on that point. Now she\nwas compelled to allude to it. \"Cannot she live at the Castle for the\npresent?\"\n\n\"What;--all alone?\"\n\n\"Of course she is remaining there now.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"of course she is there now. Now! Why, remember what\nthese telegraphic messages are. He died only on yesterday morning.\nOf course she is there, but I do not think it can be good that she\nshould remain there. There is no one near her where she is but that\nMrs. Askerton. It can hardly be good for her to have no other female\nfriend at such a time as this.\"\n\n\"I do not think that Mrs. Askerton will hurt her.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton will not hurt her at all,--and as long as Clara does\nnot know the story, Mrs. Askerton may serve as well as another. But\nyet--\"\n\n\"Can I go to her, Will?\"\n\n\"No, dearest. The journey would kill you in winter. And he would not\nlike it. We are bound to think of that for her sake,--cold-hearted,\nthankless, meagre-minded creature as I know he is.\"\n\n\"I do not know why he should be so bad.\"\n\n\"No, nor I. But I know that he is. Never mind. Why should we talk\nabout him? I suppose she'll have to go there,--to Aylmer Park. I\nsuppose they will send for her, and keep her there till it's all\nfinished. I'll tell you what, Mary,--I shall give her the place.\"\n\n\"What,--Belton Castle?\"\n\n\"Why not? Will it ever be of any good to you or me? Do you want to go\nand live there?\"\n\n\"No, indeed;--not for myself.\"\n\n\"And do you think that I could live there? Besides, why should she be\nturned out of her father's house?\"\n\n\"He would not be mean enough to take it.\"\n\n\"He would be mean enough for anything. Besides, I should take very\ngood care that it should be settled upon her.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Will;--it is indeed. You are now William Belton of\nBelton, and you must remain so.\"\n\n\"Mary,--I would sooner be Will Belton with Clara Amedroz by my side\nto get through the world with me, and not the interest of an acre\neither at Belton Castle or at Plaistow Hall! And I believe I should\nbe the richer man at the end,--if there were any good in that.\" Then\nhe went out of the room, and she heard him go through the kitchen,\nand knew that he passed out into the farm-yard, towards the stable,\nby the back-door. He intended, it seemed, to go on with his hunting\nin spite of this death which had occurred. She was sorry for it,\nbut she could not venture to stop him. And she was sorry also that\nnothing had been settled as to the writing of any letter to Clara.\nShe, however, would take upon herself to write while he was gone.\n\nHe went straight out towards the stables, hardly conscious of what he\nwas doing or where he was going, and found his hack ready saddled for\nhim in the stall. Then he remembered that he must either go or come\nto some decision that he would not go. The horse that he intended\nto ride had been sent on to the meet, and if he were not to be used,\nsome message must be despatched as to the animal's return. But Will\nwas half inclined to go, although he knew that the world would judge\nhim to be heartless if he were to go hunting immediately on the\nreceipt of the tidings which had reached him that morning. He thought\nthat he would like to set the world at defiance in this matter. Let\nFrederic Aylmer go into mourning for the old man who was dead. Let\nFrederic Aylmer be solicitous for the daughter who was left lonely in\nthe old house. No doubt he, Will Belton, had inherited the dead man's\nestate, and should, therefore, in accordance with all the ordinary\nrules of the world on such matters, submit himself at any rate to the\ndecency of funereal reserve. An heir should not be seen out hunting\non the day on which such tidings as to his heritage had reached him.\nBut he did not wish, in his present mood, to be recognised as the\nheir. He did not want the property. He would have preferred to rid\nhimself altogether of any of the obligations which the ownership of\nthe estate entailed upon him. It was not permitted to him to have the\ncustody of the old squire's daughter, and therefore he was unwilling\nto meddle with any of the old squire's concerns.\n\nBelton had gone into the stable, and had himself loosed the animal,\nleading him out into the yard as though he were about to mount him.\nThen he had given the reins to a stable boy, and had walked away\namong the farm buildings, not thinking of what he was doing. The lad\nstood staring at him with open mouth, not at all understanding his\nmaster's hesitation. The meet, as the boy knew, was fourteen miles\noff, and Belton had not allowed himself above an hour and a half for\nthe journey. It was his practice to jump into the saddle and bustle\nout of the place, as though seconds were important to him. He would\nlook at his watch with accuracy, and measure his pace from spot to\nspot, as though minutes were too valuable to be lost. But now he\nwandered away like one distraught, and the stable boy knew that\nsomething was wrong. \"I thout he was a thinken of the white cow as\nchoked 'erself with the tunnup that was skipped in the chopping,\"\nsaid the boy, as he spoke of his master afterwards to the old groom.\nAt last, however, a thought seemed to strike Belton. \"Do you get on\nBrag,\" he said to the boy, \"and ride off to Goldingham Corner, and\ntell Daniel to bring the horse home again. I shan't hunt to-day. And\nI think I shall go away from home. If so, tell him to be sure the\nhorses are out every morning;--and tell him to stop their beans. I\nmightn't hunt again for the next month.\" Then he returned into the\nhouse, and went to the parlour in which his sister was sitting. \"I\nshan't go out to-day,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought you would not, Will,\" she answered.\n\n\"Not that I see any harm in it.\"\n\n\"I don't say that there is any harm, but it is as well on such\noccasions to do as others do.\"\n\n\"That's humbug, Mary.\"\n\n\"No, Will; I do not think that. When any practice has become the\nfixed rule of the society in which we live, it is always wise to\nadhere to that rule, unless it call upon us to do something that is\nactually wrong. One should not offend the prejudices of the world,\neven if one is quite sure that they are prejudices.\"\n\n\"It hasn't been that that has brought me back, Mary. I'll tell you\nwhat. I think I'll go down to Belton--after all.\"\n\nHis sister did not know what to say in answer to this. Her chief\nanxiety was, of course, on behalf of her brother. That he should be\nmade to forget Clara Amedroz, if that were only possible, was her\ngreat desire; and his journey at such a time as this down to Belton\nwas not the way to accomplish such forgetting. And then she felt that\nClara might very possibly not wish to see him. Had Will simply been\nher cousin, such a visit might be very well; but he had attempted to\nbe more than her cousin, and therefore it would probably not be well.\nCaptain Aylmer might not like it; and Mary felt herself bound to\nconsider even Captain Aylmer's likings in such a matter. And yet she\ncould not bear to oppose him in anything. \"It would be a very long\njourney,\" she said.\n\n\"What does that signify?\"\n\n\"And then it might so probably be for nothing.\"\n\n\"Why should it be for nothing?\"\n\n\"Because--\"\n\n\"Because what? Why don't you speak out? You need not be afraid of\nhurting me. Nothing that you can say can make it at all worse than it\nis.\"\n\n\"Dear Will, I wish I could make it better.\"\n\n\"But you can't. Nobody can make it either better or worse. I promised\nher once before that I would go to her when she might be in trouble,\nand I will be as good as my word. I said I would be a brother to\nher;--and so I will. So help me God, I will!\" Then he rushed out of\nthe room, striding through the door as though he would knock it down,\nand hurried up-stairs to his own chamber. When there he stripped\nhimself of his hunting things, and dressed himself again with all\nthe expedition in his power; and then he threw a heap of clothes\ninto a large portmanteau, and set himself to work packing as though\neverything in the world were to depend upon his catching a certain\ntrain. And he went to a locked drawer, and taking out a cheque-book,\nfolded it up and put it into his pocket. Then he rang the bell\nviolently; and as he was locking the portmanteau, pressing down the\nlid with all his weight and all his strength, he ordered that a\ncertain mare should be put into a certain dog-cart, and that somebody\nmight be ready to drive over with him to the Downham Station. Within\ntwenty minutes of the time of his rushing up-stairs he appeared again\nbefore his sister with a great-coat on, and a railway rug hanging\nover his arm. \"Do you mean that you are going to-day?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes. I'll catch the 11.40 up-train at Downham. What's the good of\ngoing unless I go at once? If I can be of any use it will be at the\nfirst. It may be that she will have nobody there to do anything for\nher.\"\n\n\"There is the clergyman, and Colonel Askerton,--even if Captain\nAylmer has not gone down.\"\n\n\"The clergyman and Colonel Askerton are nothing to her. And if that\nman is there I can come back again.\"\n\n\"You will not quarrel with him?\"\n\n\"Why should I quarrel with him? What is there to quarrel about? I'm\nnot such a fool as to quarrel with a man because I hate him. If he\nis there I shall see her for a minute or two, and then I shall come\nback.\"\n\n\"I know it is no good my trying to dissuade you.\"\n\n\"None on earth. If you knew it all you would not try to dissuade me.\nBefore I thought of asking her to be my wife,--and yet I thought of\nthat very soon;--but before I ever thought of that, I told her that\nwhen she wanted a brother's help I would give it her. Of course I was\nthinking of the property,--that she shouldn't be turned out of her\nfather's house like a beggar. I hadn't any settled plan then;--how\ncould I? But I meant her to understand that when her father died\nI would be the same to her that I am to you. If you were alone, in\ndistress, would I not go to you?\"\n\n\"But I have no one else, Will,\" said she, stretching out her hand to\nhim where he stood.\n\n\"That makes no difference,\" he replied, almost roughly. \"A promise is\na promise, and I resolved from the first that my promise should hold\ngood in spite of my disappointment. Dear, dear;--it seems but the\nother day when I made it,--and now, already, everything is changed.\"\nAs he was speaking the servant entered the room, and told him that\nthe horse and gig were ready for him. \"I shall just do it nicely,\"\nsaid he, looking at his watch. \"I have over an hour. God bless you,\nMary. I shan't be away long. You may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you can tell as yet, Will.\"\n\n\"What should keep me long? I shall see Green as I go by, and that is\nhalf of my errand. I dare say I shan't stay above a night down in\nSomersetshire.\"\n\n\"You'll have to give some orders about the estate.\"\n\n\"I shall not say a word on the subject,--to anybody; that is, not to\nanybody there. I am going to look after her, and not the estate.\"\nThen he stooped down and kissed his sister, and in another minute was\nturning the corner out of the farm-yard on to the road at a quick\npace, not losing a foot of ground in the turn, in that fashion of\nrapidity which the horses at Plaistow Hall soon learned from their\nmaster. The horse is a closely sympathetic beast, and will make his\nturns, and do his trottings, and comport himself generally in strict\nunison with the pulsations of his master's heart. When a horse won't\njump it is generally the case that the inner man is declining to jump\nalso, let the outer man seem ever so anxious to accomplish the feat.\n\nBelton, who was generally very communicative with his servants,\nalways talking to any man he might have beside him in his dog-cart\nabout the fields and cattle and tillage around him, said not a word\nto the boy who accompanied him on this occasion. He had a good\nmany things to settle in his mind before he got to London, and he\nbegan upon the work as soon as he had turned the corner out of the\nfarm-yard. As regarded this Belton estate, which was now altogether\nhis own, he had always had doubts and qualms,--qualms of feeling\nrather than of conscience; and he had, also, always entertained\na strong family ambition. His people, ever so far back, had been\nBeltons of Belton. They told him that his family could be traced\nback to very early days,--before the Plantagenets, as he believed,\nthough on this point of the subject he was very hazy in his\ninformation,--and he liked the idea of being the man by whom the\nfamily should be reconstructed in its glory. Worldly circumstances\nhad been so kind to him, that he could take up the Belton estate with\nmore of the prestige of wealth than had belonged to any of the owners\nof the place for many years past. Should it come to pass that living\nthere would be desirable, he could rebuild the old house, and make\nnew gardens, and fit himself out with all the pleasant braveries of\na well-to-do English squire. There need be no pinching and scraping,\nno question whether a carriage would be possible, no doubt as to\nthe prudence of preserving game. All this had given much that was\ndelightful to his prospects. And he had, too, been instigated by a\nsomewhat weak desire to emerge from that farmer's rank into which he\nknew that many connected with him had supposed him to have sunk. It\nwas true that he farmed land that was half his own,--and that, even\nat Plaistow, he was a wealthy man; but Plaistow Hall, with all its\ncomforts, was a farm-house; and the ambition to be more than a farmer\nhad been strong upon him.\n\nBut then there had been the feeling that in taking the Belton estate\nhe would be robbing his cousin Clara of all that should have been\nhers. It must be remembered that he had not been brought up in the\nbelief that he would ever become the owner of Belton. All his high\nambition in that matter had originated with the wretched death of\nClara's brother. Could he bring himself to take it all with pleasure,\nseeing that it came to him by so sad a chance,--by a catastrophe so\ndeplorable? When he would think of this, his mind would revolt from\nits own desires, and he would declare to himself that his inheritance\nwould come to him with a stain of blood upon it. He, indeed, would\nhave been guiltless; but how could he take his pleasure in the shades\nof Belton without thinking of the tragedy which had given him the\nproperty? Such had been the thoughts and desires, mixed in their\nnature and militating against each other, which had induced him to\noffer his first visit to his cousin's house. We know what was the\neffect of that visit, and by what pleasant scheme he had endeavoured\nto overcome all his difficulties, and so to become master of Belton\nthat Clara Amedroz should also be its mistress. There had been a way\nwhich, after two days' intimacy with Clara, seemed to promise him\ncomfort and happiness on all sides. But he had come too late, and\nthat way was closed against him! Now the estate was his, and what was\nhe to do with it? Clara belonged to his rival, and in what way would\nit become him to treat her? He was still thinking simply of the\ncruelty of the circumstances which had thrown Captain Aylmer between\nhim and his cousin, when he drove himself up to the railway station\nat Downham.\n\n\"Take her back steady, Jem,\" he said to the boy.\n\n\"I'll be sure to take her wery steady,\" Jem answered.\n\n\"And tell Compton to have the samples of barley ready for me. I may\nbe back any day, and we shall be sowing early this spring.\"\n\nThen he left his cart, followed the porter who had taken his luggage\neagerly, knowing that Mr. Belton was always good for sixpence, and in\nfive minutes' time he was again in motion.\n\nOn his arrival in London he drove at once to the chambers of his\nfriend, Mr. Green, and luckily found the lawyer there. Had he missed\ndoing this, it was his intention to go out to his friend's house; and\nin that case he could not have gone down to Taunton till the next\nmorning; but now he would be able to say what he wished to say, and\nhear what he wished to hear, and would travel down by the night-mail\ntrain. He was anxious that Clara should feel that he had hurried\nto her without a moment's delay. It would do no good. He knew that.\nNothing that he could do would alter her, or be of any service to\nhim. She had accepted this man, and had herself no power of making\na change, even if she should wish it. But still there was to him\nsomething of gratification in the idea that she should be made\nto feel that he, Belton, was more instant in his affection, more\nurgent in his good offices, more anxious to befriend her in her\ndifficulties, than the man whom she had consented to take for her\nhusband. Aylmer would probably go down to Belton, but Will was very\nanxious to be the first on the ground,--very anxious,--though his\ndoing so could be of no use. All this was wrong on his part. He knew\nthat it was wrong, and he abused himself for his own selfishness. But\nsuch self-abuse gave him no aid in escaping from his own wickedness.\nHe would, if possible, be at Belton before Captain Aylmer; and he\nwould, if possible, make Clara feel that, though he was not a member\nof Parliament, though he was not much given to books, though he was\nonly a farmer, yet he had at any rate as much heart and spirit as the\nfine gentleman whom she preferred to him.\n\n\"I thought I should see you,\" said the lawyer; \"but I hardly expected\nyou so soon as this.\"\n\n\"I ought to have been a day sooner, only we don't get our telegraphic\nmessages on a Sunday.\" He still kept his great-coat on; and it seemed\nby his manner that he had no intention of staying where he was above\na minute or two.\n\n\"You'll come out and dine with me to-day?\" said Mr. Green.\n\n\"I can't do that, for I shall go down by the mail train.\"\n\n\"I never saw such a fellow in my life. What good will that do? It is\nquite right that you should be there in time for the funeral; but I\ndon't suppose he will be buried before this day week.\"\n\nBut Belton had never thought about the funeral. When he had spoken to\nhis sister of saying but a few words to Clara and then returning, he\nhad forgotten that there would be any such ceremony, or that he would\nbe delayed by any such necessity.\n\n\"I was not thinking about the funeral,\" said Belton.\n\n\"You'll only find yourself uncomfortable there.\"\n\n\"Of course I shall be uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"You can't do anything about the property, you know.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by doing anything?\" said Belton, in an angry tone.\n\n\"You can't very well take possession of the place, at any rate, till\nafter the funeral. It would not be considered the proper thing to\ndo.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that I'm a bird of prey, smelling the feast from\nafar off, and hurrying at the dead man's carcase as soon as the\nbreath is out of his body?\"\n\n\"I don't think anything of the kind, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do, or you wouldn't talk to me about doing the proper\nthing! I don't care a straw about the proper thing! If I find that\nthere's anything to be done to-morrow that can be of any use, I shall\ndo it, though all Somersetshire should think it improper! But I'm not\ngoing to look after my own interests!\"\n\n\"Take off your coat and sit down, Will, and don't look so angry at\nme. I know that you're not greedy, well enough. Tell me what you are\ngoing to do, and let me see if I can help you.\"\n\nBelton did as he was told; he pulled off his coat and sat himself\ndown by the fire. \"I don't know that you can do anything to help\nme,--at least, not as yet. But I must go and see after her. Perhaps\nshe may be all alone.\"\n\n\"I suppose she is all alone.\"\n\n\"He hasn't gone down, then?\"\n\n\"Who;--Captain Aylmer? No;--he hasn't gone down, certainly. He is in\nYorkshire.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that!\"\n\n\"He won't hurry himself. He never does, I fancy. I had a letter from\nhim this morning about Miss Amedroz.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He desired me to send her seventy-five pounds,--the interest of her\naunt's money.\"\n\n\"Seventy-five pounds!\" said Will Belton, contemptuously.\n\n\"He thought she might want money at once; and I sent her the cheque\nto-day. It will go down by the same train that carries you.\"\n\n\"Seventy-five pounds! And you are sure that he has not gone himself?\"\n\n\"It isn't likely that he should have written to me, and passed\nthrough London himself, at the same time;--but it is possible, no\ndoubt. I don't think he even knew the old squire; and there is no\nreason why he should go to the funeral.\"\n\n\"No reason at all,\" said Belton,--who felt that Captain Aylmer's\npresence at the Castle would be an insult to himself. \"I don't know\nwhat on earth he should do there,--except that I think him just the\nfellow to intrude where he is not wanted.\" And yet Will was in his\nheart despising Captain Aylmer because he had not already hurried\ndown to the assistance of the girl whom he professed to love.\n\n\"He is engaged to her, you know,\" said the lawyer, in a low voice.\n\n\"What difference does that make with such a fellow as he is, a\ncold-blooded fish of a man, who thinks of nothing in the world but\nbeing respectable? Engaged to her! Oh, damn him!\"\n\n\"I've not the slightest objection. I don't think, however, that\nyou'll find him at Belton before you. No doubt she will have heard\nfrom him; and it strikes me as very possible that she may go to\nAylmer Park.\"\n\n\"What should she go there for?\"\n\n\"Would it not be the best place for her?\"\n\n\"No. My house would be the best place for her. I am her nearest\nrelative. Why should she not come to us?\"\n\nMr. Green turned round his chair and poked the fire, and fidgeted\nabout for some moments before he answered. \"My dear fellow, you must\nknow that that wouldn't do.\" He then said, \"You ought to feel that it\nwouldn't do;--you ought indeed.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't my sister receive Miss Amedroz as well as that old\nwoman down in Yorkshire?\"\n\n\"If I may tell you, I will.\"\n\n\"Of course you may tell me.\"\n\n\"Because Miss Amedroz is engaged to be married to that old woman's\nson, and is not engaged to be married to your sister's brother. The\nthing is done, and what is the good of interfering. As far as she is\nconcerned, a great burden is off your hands.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a burden?\"\n\n\"I mean that her engagement to Captain Aylmer makes it unnecessary\nfor you to suppose that she is in want of any pecuniary assistance.\nYou told me once before that you would feel yourself called upon to\nsee that she wanted nothing.\"\n\n\"So I do now.\"\n\n\"But Captain Aylmer will look after that.\"\n\n\"I tell you what it is, Joe; I mean to settle the Belton property\nin such a way that she shall have it, and that he shan't be\nable to touch it. And it shall go to some one who shall have my\nname,--William Belton. That's what I want you to arrange for me.\"\n\n\"After you are dead, you mean.\"\n\n\"I mean now, at once. I won't take the estate from her. I hate the\nplace and everything belonging to it. I don't mean her. There is no\nreason for hating her.\"\n\n\"My dear Will, you are talking nonsense.\"\n\n\"Why is it nonsense? I may give what belongs to me to whom I please.\"\n\n\"You can do nothing of the kind;--at any rate, not by my assistance.\nYou talk as though the world were all over with you,--as though you\nwere never to be married or have any children of your own.\"\n\n\"I shall never marry.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Will. Don't make such an ass of yourself as to suppose\nthat you'll not get over such a thing as this. You'll be married and\nhave a dozen children yet to provide for. Let the eldest have Belton\nCastle, and everything will go on then in the proper way.\"\n\nBelton had now got the poker into his hands, and sat silent for some\ntime, knocking the coals about. Then he got up, and took his hat, and\nput on his coat. \"Of course I can't make you understand me,\" he said;\n\"at any rate not all at once. I'm not such a fool as to want to give\nup my property just because a girl is going to be married to a man I\ndon't like. I'm not such an ass as to give him my estate for such a\nreason as that;--for it will be giving it to him, let me tie it up\nas I may. But I've a feeling about it which makes it impossible for\nme to take it. How would you like to get a thing by another fellow\nhaving destroyed himself?\"\n\n\"You can't help that. It's yours by law.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. I know that. And as it's mine I can do what I like\nwith it. Well;--good-bye. When I've got anything to say, I'll write.\"\nThen he went down to his cab and had himself driven to the Great\nWestern Railway Hotel.\n\nCaptain Aylmer had sent to his betrothed seventy-five pounds; the\nexact interest at five per cent. for one year of the sum which his\naunt had left her. This was the first subject of which Belton thought\nwhen he found himself again in the railway carriage, and he continued\nthinking of it half the way down to Taunton. Seventy-five pounds!\nAs though this favoured lover were prepared to give her exactly her\ndue, and nothing more than her due! Had he been so placed, he, Will\nBelton, what would he have done? Seventy-five pounds might have\nbeen more money than she would have wanted, for he would have taken\nher to his own house,--to his own bosom, as soon as she would have\npermitted, and would have so laboured on her behalf, taking from her\nshoulders all money troubles, that there would have been no question\nas to principal or interest between them. At any rate he would not\nhave confined himself to sending to her the exact sum which was her\ndue. But then Aylmer was a cold-blooded man,--more like a fish than a\nman. Belton told himself over and over again that he had discovered\nthat at the single glance which he had had when he saw Captain Aylmer\nin Green's chambers. Seventy-five pounds indeed! He himself was\nprepared to give his whole estate to her, if she would take it,--even\nthough she would not marry him, even though she was going to throw\nherself away upon that fish! Then he felt somewhat as Hamlet did when\nhe jumped upon Laertes at the grave of Ophelia. Send her seventy-five\npounds indeed, while he was ready to drink up Esil for her, or to\nmake over to her the whole Belton estate, and thus abandon the idea\nfor ever of being Belton of Belton!\n\nHe reached Taunton in the middle of the night,--during the small\nhours of the morning in a winter night; but yet he could not bring\nhimself to go to bed. So he knocked up an ostler at the nearest inn,\nand ordered out a gig. He would go down to the village of Redicote,\non the Minehead road, and put up at the public-house there. He could\nnot now have himself driven at once to Belton Castle, as he would\nhave done had the old squire been alive. He fancied that his presence\nwould be a nuisance if he did so. So he went to the little inn at\nRedicote, reaching that place between four and five o'clock in the\nmorning; and very uncomfortable he was when he got there. But in his\npresent frame of mind he preferred discomfort. He liked being tired\nand cold, and felt, when he was put into a chill room, without fire,\nand with a sanded floor, that things with him were as they ought to\nbe.\n\nYes,--he could have a fly over to Belton Castle after breakfast.\nHaving learned so much, and ordered a dish of eggs and bacon for his\nmorning's breakfast, he went up-stairs to a miserable little bedroom,\nto dress himself after his night's journey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nMRS. ASKERTON'S GENEROSITY.\n\n\nThe death of the old man at Belton Castle had been very sudden. At\nthree o'clock in the morning Clara had been called into his room, and\nat five o'clock she was alone in the world,--having neither father,\nmother, nor brother; without a home, without a shilling that she\ncould call her own;--with no hope as to her future life, if,--as she\nhad so much reason to suppose,--Captain Aylmer should have chosen to\naccept her last letter as a ground for permanent separation. But at\nthis moment, on this saddest morning, she did not care much for that\nchance. It seemed to be almost indifferent to her, that question of\nLady Aylmer and her anger. The more that she was absolutely in need\nof external friendship, the more disposed was she to reject it, and\nto declare to herself that she was prepared to stand alone in the\nworld.\n\nFor the last week she had understood from the doctor that her father\nwas in truth sinking, and that she might hardly hope ever to see him\nagain convalescent. She had therefore in some sort prepared herself\nfor her loneliness, and anticipated the misery of her position. As\nsoon as it was known to the women in the room that life had left the\nold man, one of them had taken her by the hand and led her back to\nher own chamber. \"Now, Miss Clara, you had better lie down on the bed\nagain;--you had indeed; you can do nothing sitting up.\" She took the\nold woman's advice, and allowed them to do with her as they would. It\nwas true that there was no longer any work by which she could make\nherself useful in that house,--in that house, or, as far as she could\nsee, in any other. Yes; she would go to bed, and lying there would\nfeel how convenient it would be for many persons if she also could\nbe taken away to her long rest, as her father, and aunt, and brother\nhad been taken before her. Her name and family had been unfortunate,\nand it would be well that there should be no Amedroz left to trouble\nthose more fortunate persons who were to come after them. In her\nsorrow and bitterness she included both her cousin Will and Captain\nAylmer among those more fortunate ones for whose sake it might be\nwell that she should be made to vanish from off the earth. She\nhad read Captain Aylmer's letter over and over again since she\nhad answered it, and had read nearly as often the copy of her own\nreply,--and had told herself, as she read them, that of course he\nwould not forgive her. He might perhaps pardon her, if she would\nsubmit to him in everything; but that she would not submit to his\ncommands respecting Mrs. Askerton she was fully resolved,--and,\ntherefore, there could be no hope. Then, when she remembered how\nlately her dear father's spirit had fled, she hated herself for\nhaving allowed her mind to dwell on anything beyond her loss of him.\n\nShe was still in her bedroom, having fallen into that half-waking\nslumber which the numbness of sorrow so often produces, when word\nwas brought to her that Mrs. Askerton was in the house. It was\nthe first time that Mrs. Askerton had ever crossed the door, and\nthe remembrance that it was so came upon her at once. During her\nfather's lifetime it had seemed to be understood that their neighbour\nshould have no admittance there;--but now,--now that her father was\ngone,--the barrier was to be overthrown. And why not? Why should not\nMrs. Askerton come to her? Why, if Mrs. Askerton chose to be kind to\nher, should she not altogether throw herself into her friend's arms?\nOf course her doing so would give mortal offence to everybody at\nAylmer Park; but why need she stop to think of that? She had already\nmade up her mind that she would not obey orders from Aylmer Park on\nthis subject.\n\nShe had not seen Mrs. Askerton since that interview between them\nwhich was described some few chapters back. Then everything had been\ntold between them, so that there was no longer any mystery either on\nthe one side or on the other. Then Clara had assured her friend of\nher loving friendship in spite of any edicts to the contrary which\nmight come from Aylmer Park; and after that what could be more\nnatural than that Mrs. Askerton should come to her in her sorrow.\n\"She says she'll come up to you if you'll let her,\" said the servant.\nBut Clara declined this proposition, and in a few minutes went down\nto the small parlour in which she had lately lived, and where she\nfound her visitor.\n\n\"My poor dear, this has been very sudden,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"Very sudden;--very sudden. And yet, now that he has gone, I know\nthat I expected it.\"\n\n\"Of course I came to you as soon as I heard of it, because I knew\nyou were all alone. If there had been any one else I should not have\ncome.\"\n\n\"It is very good of you.\"\n\n\"Colonel Askerton thought that perhaps he had better come. I told him\nof all that which we said to each other the other day. He thought at\nfirst that it would be better that I should not see you.\"\n\n\"It was very good of you to come,\" said Clara again, and as she spoke\nshe put out her hand and took Mrs. Askerton's,--continuing to hold it\nfor awhile; \"very good indeed.\"\n\n\"I told him that I could not but go down to you,--that I thought you\nwould not understand it if I stayed away.\"\n\n\"At any rate it was good of you to come to me.\"\n\n\"I don't believe,\" said Mrs. Askerton, \"that what people call\nconsolation is ever of any use. It is a terrible thing to lose a\nfather.\"\n\n\"Very terrible. Ah, dear, I have hardly yet found out how sad it is.\nAs yet I have only been thinking of myself, and wishing that I could\nbe with him.\"\n\n\"Nay, Clara.\"\n\n\"How can I help it? What am I to do, or where am I to go? Of what use\nis life to such a one as me? And for him,--who would dare to wish him\nback again? When people have fallen and gone down in the world it is\nbad for them to go on living. Everything is a trouble, and there is\nnothing but vexation.\"\n\n\"Think what I have suffered, dear.\"\n\n\"But you have had somebody to care for you,--somebody whom you could\ntrust.\"\n\n\"And have not you?\"\n\n\"No; no one.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Clara?\"\n\n\"I mean what I say. I have no one. It is no use asking\nquestions,--not now, at such a time as this. And I did not mean to\ncomplain. Complaining is weak and foolish. I have often told myself\nthat I could bear anything, and so I will. When I can bring myself to\nthink of what I have lost in my father I shall be better, even though\nI shall be more sorrowful. As it is, I hate myself for being so\nselfish.\"\n\n\"You will let me come and stay with you to-day, will you not?\"\n\n\"No, dear; not to-day.\"\n\n\"Why not to-day, Clara?\"\n\n\"I shall be better alone. I have so many things to think of.\"\n\n\"I know well that it would be better that you should not be\nalone,--much better. But I will not press it. I cannot insist with\nyou as another woman would.\"\n\n\"You are wrong there; quite wrong. I would be led by you sooner than\nby any woman living. What other woman is there to whom I would listen\nfor a moment?\" As she said this, even in the depth of her sorrow she\nthought of Lady Aylmer, and strengthened herself in her resolution to\nrebel against her lover's mother. Then she continued, \"I wish I knew\nmy cousin Mary,--Mary Belton; but I have never seen her.\"\n\n\"Is she nice?\"\n\n\"So Will tells me; and I know that what he says must be true,--even\nabout his sister.\"\n\n\"Will, Will! You are always thinking of your cousin Will. If he be\nreally so good he will show it now.\"\n\n\"How can he show it? What can he do?\"\n\n\"Does he not inherit all the property?\"\n\n\"Of course he does. And what of that? When I say that I have no\nfriend I am not thinking of my poverty.\"\n\n\"If he has that regard for you which he pretends, he can do much to\nassist you. Why should he not come here at once?\"\n\n\"God forbid.\"\n\n\"Why? Why do you say so? He is your nearest relative.\"\n\n\"If you do not understand I cannot explain.\"\n\n\"Has he been told what has happened?\" Mrs. Askerton asked.\n\n\"Colonel Askerton sent a message to him, I believe.\"\n\n\"And to Captain Aylmer also?\"\n\n\"Yes; and to Captain Aylmer. It was Colonel Askerton who sent it.\"\n\n\"Then he will come, of course.\"\n\n\"I think not. Why should he come? He did not even know poor papa.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Clara, has he not known you?\"\n\n\"You will see that he will not come. And I tell you beforehand that\nhe will be right to stay away. Indeed, I do not know how he could\ncome;--and I do not want him here.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand you, Clara.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. I cannot very well understand myself.\"\n\n\"I should not be at all surprised if Lady Aylmer were to come\nherself.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens! How little you can know of Lady Aylmer's position and\ncharacter!\"\n\n\"But if she is to be your mother-in-law?\"\n\n\"And even if she were! The idea of Lady Aylmer coming away from\nAylmer Park,--all the way from Yorkshire, to such a house as this! If\nthey told me that the Queen was coming it would hardly disconcert me\nmore. But, dear, there is no danger of that at least.\"\n\n\"I do not know what may have passed between you and him; but unless\nthere has been some quarrel he will come. That is, he will do so if\nhe is at all like any men whom I have known.\"\n\n\"He will not come.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Askerton made some half-whispered offers of services to\nbe rendered by Colonel Askerton, and soon afterwards took her leave,\nhaving first asked permission to come again in the afternoon, and\nwhen that was declined, having promised to return on the following\nmorning. As she walked back to the cottage she could not but think\nmore of Clara's engagement to Captain Aylmer than she did of the\nsquire's death. As regarded herself, of course she could not grieve\nfor Mr. Amedroz; and as regarded Clara, Clara's father had for some\ntime past been apparently so insignificant, even in his own house,\nthat it was difficult to acknowledge the fact that the death of such\na one as he might leave a great blank in the world. But what had\nClara meant by declaring so emphatically that Captain Aylmer would\nnot visit Belton, and by speaking of herself as one who had neither\nposition nor friends in the world? If there had been a quarrel,\nindeed, then it was sufficiently intelligible;--and if there was any\nsuch quarrel, from what source must it have arisen? Mrs. Askerton\nfelt the blood rise to her cheeks as she thought of this, and told\nherself that there could be but one such source. Mrs. Askerton knew\nthat Clara had received orders from Aylmer Castle to discontinue all\nacquaintance with herself, and, therefore, there could be no doubt\nas to the cause of the quarrel. It had come to this then, that Clara\nwas to lose her husband because she was true to her friend; or rather\nbecause she would not consent to cast an additional stone at one who\nfor some years past had become a mark for many stones.\n\nI am not prepared to say that Mrs. Askerton was a high-minded woman.\nMisfortunes had come upon her in life of a sort which are too apt to\nquench high nobility of mind in woman. There are calamities which,\nby their natural tendencies, elevate the character of women and\nadd strength to the growth of feminine virtues;--but then, again,\nthere are other calamities which few women can bear without some\ndegradation, without some injury to that delicacy and tenderness\nwhich is essentially necessary to make a woman charming,--as a woman.\nIn this, I think, the world is harder to women than to men; that a\nwoman often loses much by the chance of adverse circumstances which\na man only loses by his own misconduct. That there are women whom no\ncalamity can degrade is true enough;--and so it is true that there\nare some men who are heroes; but such are exceptions both among men\nand women. Not such a one had Mrs. Askerton been. Calamity had come\nupon her;--partly, indeed, by her own fault, though that might have\nbeen pardoned;--but the weight of her misfortunes had been too great\nfor her strength, and she had become in some degree hardened by what\nshe had endured; if not unfeminine, still she was feminine in an\ninferior degree, with womanly feelings of a lower order. And she had\nlearned to intrigue, not being desirous of gaining aught by dishonest\nintriguing, but believing that she could only hold her own by\ncarrying on her battle after that fashion. In all this I am speaking\nof the general character of the woman, and am not alluding to the\none sin which she had committed. Thus, when she had first become\nacquainted with Miss Amedroz, her conscience had not rebuked her\nin that she was deceiving her new friend. When asked casually in\nconversation as to her maiden name, she had not blushed as she\nanswered the question with a falsehood. When, unfortunately, the\nname of her first husband had in some way made itself known to Clara\nshe had been ready again with some prepared fib. And when she had\nrecognised William Belton, she had thought that the danger to herself\nof having any one near her who might know her, quite justified her\nin endeavouring to create ill-will between Clara and her cousin.\n\"Self-preservation is the first law of nature,\" she would have\nsaid; and would have failed to remember, as she did always fail to\nremember,--that nature does not require by any of its laws that\nself-preservation should be aided by falsehood.\n\nBut though she was not high-minded, so also was she not ungenerous;\nand now, as she began to understand that Clara was sacrificing\nherself because of that promise which had been given when they two\nhad stood together at the window in the cottage drawing-room, she\nwas capable of feeling more for her friend than for herself. She was\ncapable even of telling herself that it was cruel on her part even\nto wish for any continuance of Clara's acquaintance. \"I have made\nmy bed, and I must lie upon it,\" she said to herself; and then she\nresolved that, instead of going up to the house on the following\nday, she would write to Clara, and put an end to the intimacy which\nexisted between them. \"The world is hard, and harsh, and unjust,\" she\nsaid, still speaking to herself. \"But that is not her fault; I will\nnot injure her because I have been injured myself.\"\n\nColonel Askerton was up at the house on the same day, but he did\nnot ask for Miss Amedroz, nor did she see him. Nobody else came to\nthe house then, or on the following morning, or on that afternoon,\nthough Clara did not fail to tell herself that Captain Aylmer might\nhave been there if he had chosen to take the journey and to leave\nhome as soon as he had received the message; and she made the same\ncalculation as to her cousin Will,--though in that calculation, as we\nknow, she was wrong. These two days had been very desolate with her,\nand she had begun to look forward to Mrs. Askerton's coming,--when\ninstead of that there came a messenger with a letter from the\ncottage.\n\n\"You can do as you like, my dear,\" Colonel Askerton had said on the\nprevious evening to his wife. He had listened to all she had been\nsaying without taking his eyes from off his newspaper, though she had\nspoken with much eagerness.\n\n\"But that is not enough. You should say more to me than that.\"\n\n\"Now I think you are unreasonable. For myself, I do not care how this\nmatter goes; nor do I care one straw what any tongues may say. They\ncannot reach me, excepting so far as they may reach me through you.\"\n\n\"But you should advise me.\"\n\n\"I always do,--copiously, when I think that I know better than you;\nbut in this matter I feel so sure that you know better than I, that I\ndon't wish to suggest anything.\" Then he went on with his newspaper,\nand she sat for a while looking at him, as though she expected that\nsomething more would be said. But nothing more was said, and she was\nleft entirely to her own guidance.\n\nSince the days in which her troubles had come upon Mrs. Askerton,\nClara Amedroz was the first female friend who had come near her\nto comfort her, and she was very loth to abandon such comfort.\nThere had, too, been something more than comfort, something almost\napproaching to triumph, when she found that Clara had clung to her\nwith affection after hearing the whole story of her life. Though\nher conscience had not pricked her while she was exercising all her\nlittle planned deceits, she had not taken much pleasure in them. How\nshould any one take pleasure in such work? Many of us daily deceive\nour friends, and are so far gone in deceit that the deceit alone is\nhardly painful to us. But the need of deceiving a friend is always\npainful. The treachery is easy; but to be treacherous to those\nwe love is never easy,--never easy, even though it be so common.\nThere had been a double delight to this poor woman in the near\nneighbourhood of Clara Amedroz since there had ceased to be any\nnecessity for falsehood on her part. But now, almost before her joy\nhad commenced, almost before she had realised the sweetness of her\ntriumph, had come upon her this task of doing that herself which\nClara in her generosity had refused to do. \"I have made my bed and I\nmust lie upon it,\" she said. And then, instead of going down to the\nhouse as she had promised, she wrote the following letter to Miss\nAmedroz:--\n\n\n   The Cottage, Monday.\n\n   DEAREST CLARA,--I need not tell you that I write as I do\n   now with a bleeding heart. A few days since I should have\n   laughed at any woman who used such a phrase of herself,\n   and declared her to be an affected fool; but now I know\n   how true such a word may be. My heart is bleeding, and\n   I feel myself to be overcome by my disgrace. You told\n   me that I did not understand you yesterday. Of course I\n   understood you. Of course I know how it all is, and why\n   you spoke as you did of Captain Aylmer. He has chosen to\n   think that you could not know me without pollution, and\n   has determined that you must give up either me or him.\n   Though he has judged me I am not going to judge him. The\n   world is on his side; and, perhaps, he is right. He knows\n   nothing of my trials and difficulties,--and why should\n   he? I do not blame him for demanding that his future wife\n   shall not be intimate with a woman who is supposed to have\n   lost her fitness for the society of women.\n\n   At any rate, dearest, you must obey him,--and we will see\n   each other no more. I am quite sure that I should be very\n   wicked were I to allow you to injure your position in life\n   on my account. You at any rate love him, and would be\n   happy with him, and as you are engaged to him, you have no\n   just ground for resenting his interference.\n\n   You will understand me now as well as though I were to\n   fill sheets and sheets of paper with what I could say\n   on the subject. The simple fact is, that you and I must\n   forget each other, or simply remember one another as past\n   friends. You will know in a day or two what your plans\n   are. If you remain here, we will go away. If you go away,\n   we will remain here;--that is, if your cousin will keep\n   us as tenants. I do not of course know what you may have\n   written to Captain Aylmer since our interview up here,\n   but I beg that you will write to him now, and make him\n   understand that he need have no fears in respect of me.\n   You may send him this letter if you will. Oh, dear! if you\n   could know what I suffer as I write this.\n\n   I feel that I owe you an apology for harassing you on such\n   a subject at such a time; but I know that I ought not to\n   lose a day in telling you that you are to see nothing more\n   of the friend who has loved you.\n\n   MARY ASKERTON.\n\n\nClara's first impulse on receiving this letter was to go off at once\nto the cottage, and insist on her privilege of choosing her own\nfriends. If she preferred Mrs. Askerton to Captain Aylmer, that was\nno one's business but her own. And she would have done so had she not\nbeen afraid of meeting with Colonel Askerton. To him she would not\nhave known how to speak on such a subject;--nor would she have known\nhow to conduct herself at the cottage without speaking of it. And\nthen, after a while, she felt that were she to do so,--should she\nnow deliberately determine to throw herself into Mrs. Askerton's\narms,--she must at the same time give up all idea of becoming Captain\nAylmer's wife. As she thought of this she asked herself various\nquestions concerning him, which she did not find it easy to answer.\nDid she wish to be his wife? Could she assure herself that if they\nwere married they would make each other happy? Did she love him? She\nwas still able to declare to herself that the answer to the last\nquestion should be an affirmative; but, nevertheless, she thought\nthat she could give him up without great unhappiness. And when she\nbegan to think of Lady Aylmer, and to remember that Frederic Aylmer's\nimperative demands upon her obedience had, in all probability, been\ndictated by his mother, she was again anxious to go at once to the\ncottage, and declare that she would not submit to any interference\nwith her own judgment.\n\nOn the next morning the postman brought to her a letter which was of\nmuch moment to her,--but he brought to her also tidings which moved\nher more even than the letter. The letter was from the lawyer,\nand enclosed a cheque for seventy-five pounds, which he had been\ninstructed to pay to her, as the interest of the money left to her\nby her aunt. What should be her answer to that letter she knew very\nwell,--and she instantly wrote it, sending back the cheque to Mr.\nGreen. The postman's news, more important than the letter, told her\nthat William Belton was at the inn at Redicote.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nPASSIONATE PLEADING.\n\n\nClara wrote her letter to the lawyer, returning the cheque, before\nshe would allow herself a moment to dwell upon the news of her\ncousin's arrival. She felt that it was necessary to do that before\nshe should even see her cousin,--thus providing against any\ndifficulty which might arise from adverse advice on his part; and as\nsoon as the letter was written she sent it to the post-office in the\nvillage. She would do almost anything that Will might tell her to do,\nbut Captain Aylmer's money she would not take, even though Will might\nso direct her. They would tell her, no doubt, among them, that the\nmoney was her own,--that she might take it without owing any thanks\nfor it to Captain Aylmer. But she knew better than that,--as she\ntold herself over and over again. Her aunt had left her nothing, and\nnothing would she have from Captain Aylmer,--unless she had all that\nCaptain Aylmer had to give, after the fashion in which women best\nlove to take such gifts.\n\nThen, when she had done that, she was able to think of her cousin's\nvisit. \"I knew he would come,\" she said to herself, as she sat\nherself in one of the old chairs in the hall, with a large shawl\nwrapped round her shoulders. She had just been to the front door,\nwith the nominal purpose of despatching her messenger thence to the\npost-office; but she had stood for a minute or two under the portico,\nlooking in the direction by which Belton would come from Redicote,\nexpecting, or rather hoping, that she might see his figure or hear\nthe sound of his gig. But she saw nothing and heard nothing, and so\nreturned into the hall, slowly shutting the door. \"I knew that he\nwould come,\" she said, repeating to herself the same words, over and\nover again. Yet when Mrs. Askerton had told her that he would do this\nthing which he had now done, she had expressed herself as almost\nfrightened by the idea. \"God forbid,\" she had said. Nevertheless now\nthat he was there at Redicote, she assured herself that his coming\nwas a thing of which she had been certain; and she took a joy in the\nknowledge of his nearness to her which she did not attempt to define\nto herself. Had he not said that he would be a brother to her, and\nwas it not a brother's part to go to a sister in affliction? \"I knew\nthat he would come. I was sure of it. He is so true.\" As to Captain\nAylmer's not coming she said nothing, even to herself; but she felt\nthat she had been equally sure on that subject. Of course, Captain\nAylmer would not come! He had sent her seventy-five pounds in lieu\nof coming, and in doing so was true to his character. Both men were\ndoing exactly that which was to have been expected of them. So at\nleast Clara Amedroz now assured herself. She did not ask herself how\nit was that she had come to love the thinner and the meaner of the\ntwo men, but she knew well that such had been her fate.\n\nOn a sudden she rose from her chair, as though remembering a duty to\nbe performed, and went to the kitchen and directed that breakfast\nmight be got ready for Mr. Belton. He would have travelled all\nnight,--and would be in want of food. Since the old squire's death\nthere had been no regular meal served in the house, and Clara had\ntaken such scraps of food and cups of tea as the old servant of the\nhouse had brought to her. But now the cloth must be spread again,\nand as she did this with her own hands she remembered the dinners\nwhich had been prepared for Captain Aylmer at Perivale after his\naunt's death. It seemed to her that she was used to be in the house\nwith death, and that the sadness and solemn ceremonies of woe were\nbecoming things familiar to her. There grew upon her a feeling that\nit must be so with her always. The circumstances of her life would\never be sad. What right had she to expect any other fate after such\na catastrophe as that which her brother had brought upon the family?\nIt was clear to her that she had done wrong in supposing that she\ncould marry and live with a prosperous man of the world like Captain\nAylmer. Their natures were different, and no such union could lead to\nany good. So she told herself, with much misery of spirit, as she was\npreparing the breakfast-table for William Belton.\n\nBut William Belton did not come to eat the breakfast. He got what he\nwanted in that way at the inn at Redicote, and even then hesitated,\nloitering at the bar, before he would go over. What was he to say,\nand how would he be received? After all, had he not done amiss in\ncoming to a house at which he probably might not be wanted? Would\nit not be thought that his journey had been made solely with a view\nto his own property? He would be regarded as the heir pouncing upon\nthe inheritance before as yet the old owner was under the ground. At\nany rate it would be too early for him to make his visit yet awhile;\nand, to kill time, he went over to a carpenter who had been employed\nby him about the place at Belton. The carpenter spoke to him as\nthough everything were his own, and was very intent upon future\nimprovements. This made Will more disgusted with himself than ever,\nand before he could get out of the carpenter's yard he thoroughly\nwished himself back at Plaistow. But having come so far, he could\nhardly return without seeing his cousin, and at last he had himself\ndriven over, reaching the house between eleven and twelve o'clock in\nthe day.\n\nClara met him in the hall, and at once led him into the room which\nshe had prepared for him. He had given her his hand in the hall, but\ndid not speak to her till she had spoken to him after the closing of\nthe room door behind them. \"I thought that you would come,\" she said,\nstill holding him by the hand.\n\n\"I did not know what to do,\" he answered. \"I couldn't say which was\nbest. Now I am here I shall only be in your way.\" He did not dare to\npress her hand, nor could he bring himself to take his away from her.\n\n\"In my way;--yes; as an angel, to tell me what to do in my trouble.\nI knew you would come, because you are so good. But you will have\nbreakfast;--see, I have got it ready for you.\"\n\n\"Oh no; I breakfasted at Redicote. I would not trouble you.\"\n\n\"Trouble me, Will! Oh, Will, if you knew!\" Then there came tears in\nher eyes, and at the sight of them both his own were filled. How\nwas he to stand it? To take her to his bosom and hold her there for\nalways; to wipe away her tears so that she should weep no more; to\ndevote himself and all his energy and all that was his to comfort\nher,--this he could have done; but he knew not how to do anything\nshort of this. Every word that she spoke to him was an encouragement\nto this, and yet he knew that it could not be so. To say a word of\nhis love, or even to look it, would now be an unmanly insult. And\nyet, how was he not to look it,--not to speak of it? \"It is such a\ncomfort that you should be here with me,\" she said.\n\n\"Then I am glad I am here, though I do not know what I can do. Did he\nsuffer much, Clara?\"\n\n\"No, I think not; very little. He sank at last quicker than I\nexpected, but just as I thought he would go. He used to speak of you\nso often, and always with regard and esteem!\"\n\n\"Dear old man!\"\n\n\"Yes, Will; he was, in spite of his little faults. No father ever\nloved his daughter better than he loved me.\"\n\nAfter a while the servant brought in the tea, explaining to Belton\nthat Miss Clara had neither eaten nor drank that morning. \"She\nwouldn't take anything till you came, sir.\" Then Will added his\nentreaties, and Clara was persuaded, and by degrees there grew\nbetween them more ease of manner and capability for talking than had\nbeen within their reach when they first met. And during the morning\nmany things were explained, as to which Clara would a few hours\npreviously have thought it to be almost impossible that she should\nspeak to her cousin. She had told him of her aunt's money, and the\nway in which she had on that very morning sent back the cheque to the\nlawyer; and she had said something also as to Lady Aylmer's views,\nand her own views as to Lady Aylmer. With Will this subject was one\nmost difficult of discussion; and he blushed and fidgeted in his\nchair, and walked about the room, and found himself unable to look\nClara in the face as she spoke to him. But she went on, goading him\nwith the name, which of all names was the most distasteful to him;\nand mentioning that name almost in terms of reproach,--of reproach\nwhich he felt it would be ungenerous to reciprocate, but which he\nwould have exaggerated to unmeasured abuse if he had given his tongue\nlicence to speak his mind.\n\n\"I was right to send back the money;--wasn't I, Will? Say that I was\nright. Pray tell me that you think so!\"\n\n\"I don't understand it at present, you see; I am no lawyer.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't want a lawyer to know that I couldn't take the money\nfrom him. I am sure you feel that.\"\n\n\"If a man owes money of course he ought to pay it.\"\n\n\"But he doesn't owe it, Will. It is intended for generosity.\"\n\n\"You don't want anybody's generosity, certainly.\" Then he reflected\nthat Clara must, after all, depend entirely on the generosity of\nsome one till she was married; and he wanted to explain to her that\neverything he had in the world was at her service,--was indeed her\nown. Or he would have explained, if he knew how, that he did not\nintend to take advantage of the entail,--that the Belton estate\nshould belong to her as the natural heir of her father. But he\nconceived that the moment for explaining this had hardly as yet\narrived, and that he had better confine himself to some attempt at\nteaching her that no extraneous assistance would be necessary to her.\n\"In money matters,\" said he, \"of course you are to look to me. That\nis a matter of course. I'll see Green about the other affairs. Green\nand I are friends. We'll settle it.\"\n\n\"That's not what I meant, Will.\"\n\n\"But it's what I mean. This is one of those things in which a man has\nto act on his own judgment. Your father and I understood each other.\"\n\n\"He did not understand that I was to accept your bounty.\"\n\n\"Bounty is a nasty word, and I hate it. You accepted me,--as your\nbrother, and as such I mean to act.\" The word almost stuck in his\nthroat, but he brought it out at last in a fierce tone, of which she\nunderstood accurately the cause and meaning. \"All money matters about\nthe place must be settled by me. Indeed, that's why I came down.\"\n\n\"Not only for that, Will?\"\n\n\"Just to be useful in that way, I mean.\"\n\n\"You came to see me,--because you knew I should want you.\" Surely\nthis was malice prepense! Knowing what was his want, how could she\nexasperate it by talking thus of her own? \"As for money, I have no\nclaim on any one. No creature was ever more forlorn. But I will not\ntalk of that.\"\n\n\"Did you not say that you would treat me as a brother?\"\n\n\"I did not mean that I was to be a burden on you.\"\n\n\"I know what I meant, and that is sufficient.\"\n\nBelton had been at the house some hours before he made any sign\nof leaving her, and when he did so he had to explain something\nof his plans. He would remain, he said, for about a week in the\nneighbourhood. She of course was obliged to ask him to stay at the\nhouse,--at the house which was in fact his own; but he declined to do\nthis, blurting out his reason at last very plainly. \"Captain Aylmer\nwould not like it, and I suppose you are bound to think of what he\nlikes and dislikes.\" \"I don't know what right Captain Aylmer would\nhave to dislike any such thing,\" said Clara. But, nevertheless,\nshe allowed the reason to pass as current, and did not press her\ninvitation. Will declared that he would stay at the inn at Redicote,\nstriving to explain in some very unintelligible manner that such an\narrangement would be very convenient. He would remain at Redicote,\nand would come over to Belton every day during his sojourn in the\ncountry. Then he asked one question in a low whisper as to the last\nsad ceremony, and, having received an answer, started off with the\ndeclared intention of calling on Colonel Askerton.\n\nThe next two or three days passed uncomfortably enough with Will\nBelton. He made his head-quarters at the little inn of Redicote, and\ndrove himself backwards and forwards between that place and the\nestate which was now his own. On each of these days he saw Colonel\nAskerton, whom he found to be a civil pleasant man, willing enough to\nrid himself of the unpleasant task he had undertaken, but at the same\ntime, willing also to continue his services if any further services\nwere required of him. But of Mrs. Askerton on these occasions Will\nsaw nothing, nor had he ever spoken to her since the time of his\nfirst visit to the Castle. Then came the day of the funeral, and\nafter that rite was over he returned with his cousin to the house.\nThere was no will to be read. The old squire had left no will, nor\nwas there anything belonging to him at the time of his death that he\ncould bequeath. The furniture in the house, the worn-out carpets and\nold-fashioned chairs, belonged to Clara; but, beyond that, property\nhad she none, nor had it been in her father's power to endow her with\nanything. She was alone in the world, penniless, with a conviction\non her own mind that her engagement with Frederic Aylmer must of\nnecessity come to an end, and with a feeling about her cousin which\nshe could hardly analyse, but which told her that she could not go to\nhis house in Norfolk, nor live with him at Belton Castle, nor trust\nherself in his hands as she would into those of a real brother.\n\nOn the afternoon of the day on which her father had been buried, she\nbrought to him a letter, asking him to read it, and tell her what\nshe should do. The letter was from Lady Aylmer, and contained an\ninvitation to Aylmer Castle. It had been accompanied, as the reader\nmay possibly remember, by a letter from Captain Aylmer himself. Of\nthis she of course informed her cousin; but she did not find it to be\nnecessary to show the letter of one rival to the other. Lady Aylmer's\nletter was cold in its expression of welcome, but very dictatorial\nin pointing out the absolute necessity that Clara should accept the\ninvitation so given. \"I think you will not fail to agree with me,\ndear Miss Amedroz,\" the letter said, \"that under these strange and\nperplexing circumstances, this is the only roof which can, with\nany propriety, afford you a shelter.\" \"And why not the poor-house?\"\nshe said, aloud to her cousin, when she perceived that his eye had\ndescended so far on the page. He shook his head angrily, but said\nnothing; and when he had finished the letter he folded it and gave it\nback still in silence. \"And what am I to do?\" she said. \"You tell me\nthat I am to come to you for advice in everything.\"\n\n\"You must decide for yourself here.\"\n\n\"And you won't advise me. You won't tell me whether she is right?\"\n\n\"I suppose she is right.\"\n\n\"Then I had better go?\"\n\n\"If you mean to marry Captain Aylmer, you had better go.\"\n\n\"I am engaged to him.\"\n\n\"Then you had better go.\"\n\n\"But I will not submit myself to her tyranny.\"\n\n\"Let the marriage take place at once, and you will have to submit\nonly to his. I suppose you are prepared for that?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I do not like tyranny.\"\n\nAgain he stood silent for awhile, looking at her, and then he\nanswered: \"I should not tyrannise over you, Clara.\"\n\n\"Oh, Will, Will, do not speak like that. Do not destroy everything.\"\n\n\"What am I to say?\"\n\n\"What would you say if your sister, your real sister, asked advice in\nsuch a strait? If you had a sister, who came to you, and told you all\nher difficulty, you would advise her. You would not say words to make\nthings worse for her.\"\n\n\"It would be very different.\"\n\n\"But you said you would be my brother.\"\n\n\"How am I to know what you feel for this man? It seems to me that you\nhalf hate him, half fear him, and sometimes despise him.\"\n\n\"Hate him!--No, I never hate him.\"\n\n\"Go to him, then, and ask him what you had better do. Don't ask me.\"\nThen he hurried out of the room, slamming the door behind him. But\nbefore he had half gone down the stairs he remembered the ceremony\nat which he had just been present, and how desolate she was in the\nworld, and he returned to her. \"I beg your pardon, Clara,\" he said,\n\"I am passionate; but I must be a beast to show my passion to you\non such a day as this. If I were you I should accept Lady Aylmer's\ninvitation,--merely thanking her for it in the ordinary way. I should\nthen go and see how the land lay. That is the advice I should give my\nsister.\"\n\n\"And I will,--if it is only because you tell me.\n\n\"But as for a home,--tell her you have one of your own,--at Belton\nCastle, from which no one can turn you out, and where no one can\nintrude on you. This house belongs to you.\" Then, before she could\nanswer him, he had left the room; and she listened to his heavy quick\nfootsteps as he went across the hall and out of the front door.\n\nHe walked across the park and entered the little gate of Colonel\nAskerton's garden, as though it were his habit to go to the cottage\nwhen he was at Belton. There had been various matters on which the\ntwo men had been brought into contact concerning the old squire's\ndeath and the tenancy of the cottage, so that they had become almost\nintimate. Belton had nothing new that he specially desired to say to\nColonel Askerton, whom, indeed, he had seen only a short time before\nat the funeral; but he wanted the relief of speaking to some one\nbefore he returned to the solitude of the inn at Redicote. On this\noccasion, however, the Colonel was out, and the maid asked him if he\nwould see Mrs. Askerton. When he said something about not troubling\nher, the girl told him that her mistress wished to speak to him, and\nthen he had no alternative but to allow himself to be shown into the\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"I want to see you a minute,\" said Mrs. Askerton, bowing to him\nwithout putting out her hand, \"that I might ask you how you find your\ncousin.\"\n\n\"She is pretty well, I think.\"\n\n\"Colonel Askerton has seen more of her than I have since her father's\ndeath, and he says that she does not bear it well. He thinks that she\nis ill.\"\n\n\"I do not think her ill. Of course she is not in good spirits.\"\n\n\"No; exactly. How should she be? But he thinks she seems so worn. I\nhope you will excuse me, Mr. Belton, but I love her so well that I\ncannot bear to be quite in the dark as to her future. Is anything\nsettled yet?\"\n\n\"She is going to Aylmer Castle.\"\n\n\"To Aylmer Castle! Is she indeed? At once?\"\n\n\"Very soon. Lady Aylmer has asked her.\"\n\n\"Lady Aylmer! Then I suppose--\"\n\n\"You suppose what?\" Will Belton asked.\n\n\"I did not think she would have gone to Aylmer Castle,--though I dare\nsay it is the best thing she could do. She seemed to me to dislike\nthe Aylmers,--that is, Lady Aylmer,--so much! But I suppose she is\nright?\"\n\n\"She is right to go if she likes it.\"\n\n\"She is circumstanced so cruelly! Is she not? Where else could she\ngo? I do so feel for her. I believe I need hardly tell you, Mr.\nBelton, that she would be as welcome here as flowers in May,--but\nthat I do not dare to ask her to come to us.\" She said this in a low\nvoice, turning her eyes away from him, looking first upon the ground,\nand then again up at the window,--but still not daring to meet his\neye.\n\n\"I don't exactly know about that,\" said Belton awkwardly.\n\n\"You know, I hope, that I love her dearly.\"\n\n\"Everybody does that,\" said Will.\n\n\"You do, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I do; just as though she were--my sister.\"\n\n\"And as your sister would you let her come here,--to us?\" He sat\nsilent for awhile, thinking, and she waited patiently for his answer.\nBut she spoke again before he answered her. \"I am well aware that you\nknow all my history, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't tell it her, if you mean that, though she were my\nsister. If she were my wife I should tell her.\"\n\n\"And why your wife?\"\n\n\"Because then I should be sure it would do no harm.\"\n\n\"Then I find that you can be generous, Mr. Belton. But she knows it\nall as well as you do.\"\n\n\"I did not tell her.\"\n\n\"Nor did I;--but I should have done so had not Captain Aylmer been\nbefore me. And now tell me whether I could ask her to come here.\"\n\n\"It would be useless, as she is going to Aylmer Castle.\"\n\n\"But she is going there simply to find a home,--having no other.\"\n\n\"That is not so, Mrs. Askerton. She has a home as perfectly her own\nas any woman in the land. Belton Castle is hers, to do what she may\nplease with it. She can live here if she likes it, and nobody can say\na word to her. She need not go to Aylmer Castle to look for a home.\"\n\n\"You mean you would lend her the house?\"\n\n\"It is hers.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, Mr. Belton.\"\n\n\"It does not signify;--we will say no more about it.\"\n\n\"And you think she likes going to Lady Aylmer's?\"\n\n\"How should I say what she likes?\"\n\nThen there was another pause before Mrs. Askerton spoke again. \"I can\ntell you one thing,\" she said: \"she does not like him.\"\n\n\"That is her affair.\"\n\n\"But she should be taught to know her own mind before she throws\nherself away altogether. You would not wish your cousin to marry a\nman whom she does not love because at one time she had come to think\nthat she loved him. That is the truth of it, Mr. Belton. If she goes\nto Aylmer Castle she will marry him,--and she will be an unhappy\nwoman always afterwards. If you would sanction her coming here for\na few days, I think all that would be cured. She would come in a\nmoment, if you advised her.\"\n\nThen he went away, allowing himself to make no further answer at the\nmoment, and discussed the matter with himself as he walked back to\nRedicote, meditating on it with all his mind, and all his heart,\nand all his strength. And, as he meditated, it came on to rain\nbitterly,--a cold piercing February rain,--and the darkness of night\ncame upon him, and he floundered on through the thick mud of the\nSomersetshire lanes, unconscious of the weather and of the darkness.\nThere was a way open to him by which he might even yet get what he\nwanted. He thought he saw that there was a way open to him through\nthe policy of this woman, whom he perceived to have become friendly\nto him. He saw, or thought that he saw, it all. No day had absolutely\nbeen fixed for this journey to Yorkshire; and if Clara were induced\nto go first to the cottage, and stay there with Mrs. Askerton, no\nsuch journey might ever be taken. He could well understand that\nsuch a visit on her part would give a mortal offence to all the\nAylmers. That tyranny of which Clara spoke with so much dread would\nbe exhibited then without reserve, and so there would be an end\naltogether of the Aylmer alliance. But were she once to start for\nAylmer Park, then there would be no hope for him. Then her fate would\nbe decided,--and his. As far as he could see, too,--as far as he\ncould see then, there would be no dishonesty in this plan. Why should\nClara not go to Mrs. Askerton's house? What could be more natural\nthan such a visit at such a time? If she were in truth his sister\nhe would not interfere to prevent it if she wished it. He had told\nhimself that the woman should be forgiven her offence, and had\nthought that that forgiveness should be complete. If the Aylmers\nwere so unreasonable as to quarrel with her on this ground, let\nthem quarrel with her. Mrs. Askerton had told him that Clara did\nnot really like Captain Aylmer. Perhaps it was so; and if so, what\ngreater kindness could he do her than give her an opportunity for\nescaping such a union?\n\nThe whole of the next day he remained at Redicote, thinking,\ndoubting, striving to reconcile his wishes and his honesty. It rained\nall day, and as he sat alone, smoking in the comfortless inn, he\ntold himself that the rain was keeping him;--but in truth it was not\nthe rain. Had he resolved to do his best to prevent this visit to\nYorkshire, or had he resolved to further it, I think he would have\ngone to Belton without much fear of the rain. On the second day after\nthe funeral he did go, and he had then made up his mind. Clara,\nif she would listen to him, should show her independence of Lady\nAylmer by staying a few days with the Askertons before she went to\nYorkshire, and by telling Lady Aylmer that such was her intention.\n\"If she really loves the man,\" he said to himself, \"she will go at\nonce, in spite of anything that I can say. If she does not, I shall\nbe saving her.\"\n\n\"How cruel of you not to come yesterday!\" Clara said, as soon as she\nsaw him.\n\n\"It rained hard,\" he answered.\n\n\"But men like you care so little for rain; but that is when you have\nbusiness to take you out,--or pleasure.\"\n\n\"You need not be so severe. The truth is I had things to trouble me.\"\n\n\"What troubled you, Will? I thought all the trouble was mine.\"\n\n\"I suppose everybody thinks that his own shoe pinches the hardest.\"\n\n\"Your shoe can't pinch you very bad, I should think. Sometimes when\nI think of you it seems that you are an embodiment of prosperity and\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"I don't see it myself;--that's all. Did you write to Lady Aylmer,\nClara?\"\n\n\"I wrote; but I didn't send it. I would not send any letter till\nI had shown it to you, as you are my confessor and adviser. There;\nread it. Nothing, I think, could be more courteous or less humble.\"\nHe took the letter and read it. Clara had simply expressed herself\nwilling to accept Lady Aylmer's invitation, and asked her ladyship to\nfix a day. There was no mention of Captain Aylmer's name in the note.\n\n\"And you think this is best?\" he said. His voice was hardly like his\nown as he spoke. There was wanting to it that tone of self-assurance\nwhich his voice almost always possessed, even when self-assurance was\nlacking to his words.\n\n\"I thought it was your own advice,\" she said.\n\n\"Well;--yes; that is, I don't quite know. You couldn't go for a week\nor so yet, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Perhaps in about a week.\"\n\n\"And what will you do till then?\"\n\n\"What will I do!\"\n\n\"Yes;--where do you mean to stay?\"\n\n\"I thought, Will, that perhaps you would let me--remain here.\"\n\n\"Let you!--Oh, heavens! Look here, Clara.\"\n\n\"What is it, Will?\"\n\n\"Before heaven I want to do for you what may be the best for\nyou,--without thinking of myself;--without thinking of myself, if I\ncould only help it.\"\n\n\"I have never doubted you. I never will doubt you. I believe in you\nnext to my God. I do, Will; I do.\" He walked up and down the room\nhalf-a-dozen times before he spoke again, while she stood by the\ntable watching him. \"I wish,\" she said, \"I knew what it is that\ntroubles you.\" To this he made no answer, but went on walking till\nshe came up to him, and putting both her hands upon his arm said, \"It\nwill be better, Will, that I should go;--will it not? Speak to me,\nand say so. I feel that it will be better.\" Then he stopped in his\nwalk and looked down upon her, as her hands still rested upon his\nshoulder. He gazed upon her for some few seconds, remaining quite\nmotionless, and then, opening his arms, he surrounded her with his\nembrace, and pressing her with all his strength close to his bosom,\nkissed her forehead, and her cheeks, and her lips, and her eyes. His\nwill was so masterful, his strength so great, and his motion so\nquick, that she was powerless to escape from him till he relaxed his\nhold. Indeed she hardly struggled, so much was she surprised and so\nsoon released. But the moment that he left her he saw that her face\nwas burning red, and that the tears were streaming from her eyes. She\nstood for a moment trembling, with her hands clenched, and with a\nlook of scorn upon her lips and brow that he had never seen before;\nand then she threw herself on a sofa, and, burying her face, sobbed\naloud, while her whole body was shaken as with convulsions. He leaned\nover her repentant, not knowing what to do, not knowing how to speak.\nAll ideas of his scheme had gone from him now. He had offended her\nfor ever,--past redemption. What could be the use now of any scheme?\nAnd as he stood there he hated himself because of his scheme. The\nutter misery and disgrace of the present moment had come upon him\nbecause he had thought more of himself than of her. It was but a few\nmoments since she had told him that she trusted him next to her God;\nand yet, in those few moments, he had shown himself utterly unworthy\nof that trust, and had destroyed all her confidence. But he could not\nleave her without speaking to her. \"Clara!\" he said;--\"Clara.\" But\nshe did not answer him. \"Clara; will you not speak to me? Will you\nnot let me ask you to forgive me?\" But still she only sobbed. For\nher, at that moment, we may say that sobbing was easier than speech.\nHow was she to pardon so great an offence? How was she to resent such\npassionate love?\n\nBut he could not continue to stand there motionless, all but\nspeechless, while she lay with her face turned away from him. He must\nat any rate in some manner take himself away out of the room; and\nthis he could not do, even in his present condition of unlimited\ndisgrace, without a word of farewell. \"Perhaps I had better go and\nleave you,\" he said.\n\nThen at last there came a voice, \"Oh, Will, why have you done this?\nWhy have you treated me so badly?\" When he had last seen her face\nher mouth had been full of scorn, but there was no scorn now in her\nvoice. \"Why--why--why?\"\n\nWhy indeed;--except that it was needful for him that she should know\nthe depth of his passion. \"If you will forgive me, Clara, I will not\noffend you so again,\" he said.\n\n\"You have offended me. What am I to say? What am I to do? I have no\nother friend.\"\n\n\"I am a wretch. I know that I am a wretch.\"\n\n\"I did not suspect that you would be so cruel. Oh, Will!\"\n\nBut before he went she told him that she had forgiven him, and she\nhad preached to him a solemn, sweet sermon on the wickedness of\nyielding to momentary impulses. Her low, grave words sank into his\nears as though they were divine; and when she said a word to him,\nblushing as she spoke, of the sin of his passion, and of what her\nsin would be if she were to permit it, he sat by her weeping like an\ninfant, tears which were certainly tears of innocence. She had been\nvery angry with him; but I think she loved him better when her sermon\nwas finished, than she had ever loved him before.\n\nThere was no further question as to her going to Aylmer Castle, nor\nwas any mention made of Mrs. Askerton's invitation to the cottage.\nThe letter for Lady Aylmer was sent, and it was agreed between them\nthat Will should remain at Redicote till the answer from Yorkshire\nshould come, and should then convey Clara as far as London on her\njourney. And when he took leave of her that afternoon, she was able\nto give him her hand in her old hearty, loving way, and to call him\nWill with the old hearty, loving tone. And he,--he was able to accept\nthese tokens of her graciousness, as though they were signs of a\npardon which she had been good to give, but which he certainly had\nnot deserved.\n\nAs he went back to Redicote, he swore to himself that he would never\nlove any woman but her,--even though she must be the wife of Captain\nAylmer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nTHE LAST DAY AT BELTON.\n\n\nIn course of post there came an answer from Lady Aylmer, naming a\nday for Clara's journey to Yorkshire, and also a letter from Captain\nAylmer, in which he stated that he would meet her in London and\nconvey her down to Aylmer Park. \"The House is sitting,\" he said, \"and\ntherefore I shall be a little troubled about my time; but I cannot\nallow that your first meeting with my mother should take place in\nmy absence.\" This was all very well, but at the end of the letter\nthere was a word of caution that was not so well. \"I am sure, my dear\nClara, that you will remember how much is due to my mother's age,\nand character, and position. Nothing will be wanted to the happiness\nof our marriage, if you can succeed in gaining her affection, and\ntherefore I make it my first request to you that you should endeavour\nto win her good opinion.\" There was nothing perhaps really amiss,\ncertainly nothing unreasonable, in such words from a future husband\nto his future wife; but Clara, as she read them, shook her head and\npressed her foot against the ground in anger. It would not do. Sorrow\nwould come, and trouble and disappointment. She did not say so, even\nto herself, in words; but the words, though not spoken, were audible\nenough to herself. She could not, would not, bend to Lady Aylmer, and\nshe knew that trouble would come of this visit.\n\nI fear that many ladies will condemn Miss Amedroz when I tell them\nthat she showed this letter to her cousin Will. It does not promise\nwell for any of the parties concerned when a young woman with two\nlovers can bring herself to show the love-letters of him to whom\nshe is engaged to the other lover whom she has refused! But I have\ntwo excuses to put forward in Clara's defence. In the first place,\nCaptain Aylmer's love-letters were not in truth love-letters, but\nwere letters of business; and in the next place, Clara was teaching\nherself to regard Will Belton as her brother, and to forget that he\nhad ever assumed the part of a lover.\n\nShe was so teaching herself, but I cannot say that the lesson was\none easily learned; nor had the outrage upon her of which Will had\nbeen guilty, and which was described in the last chapter, made the\nteaching easier. But she had determined, nevertheless, that it should\nbe so. When she thought of Will her heart would become very soft\ntowards him; and sometimes, when she thought of Captain Aylmer, her\nheart would become anything but soft towards him. Unloving feelings\nwould be very strong within her bosom as she re-read his letters, and\nremembered that he had not come to her, but had sent her seventy-five\npounds to comfort her in her trouble! Nevertheless, he was to be\nher husband, and she would do her duty. What might have happened\nhad Will Belton come to Belton Castle before she had known Frederic\nAylmer,--of that she stoutly resolved that she would never think at\nall; and consequently the thought was always intruding upon her.\n\n\"You will sleep one night in town, of course?\" said Will.\n\n\"I suppose so. You know all about it. I shall do as I'm told.\"\n\n\"You can't go down to Yorkshire from here in one day. Where would you\nlike to stay in London?\"\n\n\"How on earth should I know? Ladies do sleep at hotels in London\nsometimes, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I can write and have rooms ready for you.\"\n\n\"Then that difficulty is over,\" said Clara.\n\nBut in Belton's estimation the difficulty was not exactly over.\nCaptain Aylmer would, of course, be in London that night, and it was\na question with Will whether or no Clara was not bound in honour\nto tell the--accursed beast, I am afraid Mr. Belton called him in\nhis soliloquies--where she would lodge on the occasion. Or would\nit suffice that he, Will, should hand her over to the enemy at the\nstation of the Great Northern Railway on the following morning?\nAll the little intricacies of the question presented themselves to\nWill's imagination. How careful he would be with her, that the inn\naccommodation should suffice for her comfort! With what pleasure\nwould he order a little dinner for them two, making something of a\ngentle _f\u00c3\u00aate_ of the occasion! How sedulously would he wait upon her\nwith those little attentions, amounting almost to worship, with which\nsuch men as Will Belton are prone to treat all women in exceptionable\ncircumstances, when the ordinary routine of life has been disturbed!\nIf she had simply been his cousin, and if he had never regarded\nher otherwise, how happily could he have done all this! As things\nnow were, if it was left to him to do, he should do it, with what\npatience and grace might be within his power; he would do it, though\nhe would be mindful every moment of the bitterness of the transfer\nwhich he would so soon be obliged to make; but he doubted whether it\nwould not be better for Clara's sake that the transfer should be made\nover-night. He would take her up to London, because in that way he\ncould be useful; and then he would go away and hide himself. \"Has\nCaptain Aylmer said where he would meet you?\" he asked after a pause.\n\n\"Of course I must write and tell him.\"\n\n\"And is he to come to you,--when you reach London?\"\n\n\"He has said nothing about that. He will probably be at the House of\nCommons, or too busy somewhere to come to me then. But why do you\nask? Do you wish to hurry through town?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps you have friends you want to see. Pray don't let me be in\nyour way. I shall do very well, you know.\"\n\nBelton rebuked her by a look before he answered her. \"I was only\nthinking,\" he said, \"of what would be most convenient for yourself.\nI have nobody to see, and nothing to do, and nowhere to go to.\" Then\nClara understood it all, and said that she would write to Captain\nAylmer and ask him to join them at the hotel.\n\nShe determined that she would see Mrs. Askerton before she went; and\nas that lady did not come to the Castle, Clara called upon her at\nthe cottage. This she did the day before she left, and she took her\ncousin with her. Belton had been at the cottage once or twice since\nthe day on which Mrs. Askerton had explained to him how the Aylmer\nalliance might be extinguished, but Colonel Askerton had always been\nthere, and no reference had been made to the former conversation.\nColonel Askerton was not there now, and Belton was almost afraid that\nwords would be spoken to which he would hardly know how to listen.\n\n\"And so you are really going?\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"Yes; we start to-morrow,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I am not thinking of the journey to London,\" said Mrs. Askerton,\n\"but of the danger and privations of your subsequent progress to the\nNorth.\"\n\n\"I shall do very well. I am not afraid that any one will eat me.\"\n\n\"There are so many different ways of eating people! Are there not,\nMr. Belton?\"\n\n\"I don't know about eating, but there are a great many ways of boring\npeople,\" said he.\n\n\"And I should think they will be great at that kind of thing at\nAylmer Castle. One never hears of Sir Anthony, but I can fancy Lady\nAylmer to be a terrible woman.\"\n\n\"I shall manage to hold my own, I dare say,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I hope you will; I do hope you will,\" said Mrs. Askerton. \"I don't\nknow whether you will be powerful to do so, or whether you will fail;\nmy heart is not absolute; but I do know what will be the result if\nyou are successful.\"\n\n\"It is much more then than I know myself.\"\n\n\"That I can believe too. Do you travel down to Yorkshire alone?\"\n\n\"No; Captain Aylmer will meet me in town.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Askerton looked at Mr. Belton, but made no immediate reply;\nnor did she say anything further about Clara's journey. She looked\nat Mr. Belton, and Will caught her eye, and understood that he was\nbeing rebuked for not having carried out that little scheme which had\nbeen prepared for him. But he had come to hate the scheme, and almost\nhated Mrs. Askerton for proposing it. He had declared to himself\nthat her welfare, Clara's welfare, was the one thing which he should\nregard; and he had told himself that he was not strong enough, either\nin purpose or in wit, to devise schemes for her welfare. She was\nbetter able to manage things for herself than he was to manage them\nfor her. If she loved this \"accursed beast,\" let her marry him;\nonly,--for that was now his one difficulty,--only he could not bring\nhimself to think it possible that she should love him.\n\n\"I suppose you will never see this place again?\" said Mrs. Askerton\nafter a long pause.\n\n\"I hope I shall, very often,\" said Clara. \"Why should I not see it\nagain? It is not going out of the family.\"\n\n\"No; not exactly out of the family. That is, it will belong to your\ncousin.\"\n\n\"And cousins may be as far apart as strangers, you mean; but Will and\nI are not like that; are we, Will?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what we are like,\" said he.\n\n\"You do not mean to say that you will throw me over? But the truth\nis, Mrs. Askerton, that I do not mean to be thrown over. I look upon\nhim as my brother, and I intend to cling to him as sisters do cling.\"\n\n\"You will hardly come back here before you are married,\" said Mrs.\nAskerton. It was a terrible speech for her to make, and could only\nbe excused on the ground that the speaker was in truth desirous of\ndoing that which she thought would benefit both of those whom she\naddressed. \"Of course you are going to your wedding now?\"\n\n\"I am doing nothing of the kind,\" said Clara. \"How can you speak in\nthat way to me so soon after my father's death? It is a rebuke to me\nfor being here at all.\"\n\n\"I intend no rebuke, as you well know. What I mean is this; if you do\nnot stay in Yorkshire till you are married, let the time be when it\nmay, where do you intend to go in the meantime?\"\n\n\"My plans are not settled yet.\"\n\n\"She will have this house if she pleases,\" said Will. \"There will be\nno one else here. It will be her own, to do as she likes with it.\"\n\n\"She will hardly come here,--to be alone.\"\n\n\"I will not be inquired into, my dear,\" said Clara, speaking with\nrestored good-humour. \"Of course I am an unprotected female, and\nsubject to disadvantages. Perhaps I have no plans for the future; and\nif I have plans, perhaps I do not mean to divulge them.\"\n\n\"I had better come to the point at once,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\"If--if--if it should ever suit you, pray come here to us. Flowers\nshall not be more welcome in May. It is difficult to speak of it all,\nthough you both understand everything as well as I do. I cannot press\nmy invitation as another woman might.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can,\" said Clara with energy. \"Of course you can.\"\n\n\"Can I? Then I do. Dear Clara, do come to us.\" And then as she spoke\nMrs. Askerton knelt on the ground at her visitor's knees. \"Mr.\nBelton, do tell her that when she is tired with the grandeur of\nAylmer Park she may come to us here.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about the grandeur of Aylmer Park,\" said Will,\nsuddenly.\n\n\"But she may come here;--may she not?\"\n\n\"She will not ask my leave,\" said he.\n\n\"She says that you are her brother. Whose leave should she ask?\"\n\n\"He knows that I should ask his rather than that of any living\nperson,\" said Clara.\n\n\"There, Mr. Belton. Now you must say that she may come;--or that she\nmay not.\"\n\n\"I will say nothing. She knows what to do much better than I can tell\nher.\"\n\nMrs. Askerton was still kneeling, and again appealed to Clara.\n\"You hear what he says. What do you say yourself? Will you come\nto us?--that is, if such a visit will suit you,--in point of\nconvenience?\"\n\n\"I will make no promise; but I know no reason why I should not.\"\n\n\"And I must be content with that? Well: I will be content.\" Then\nshe got up. \"For such a one as I am, that is a great deal. And, Mr.\nBelton, let me tell you this;--I can be grateful to you, though you\ncannot be gracious to me.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not been ungracious,\" said he.\n\n\"Upon my word, I cannot compliment you. But there is something so\nmuch better than grace, that I can forgive you. You know, at any\nrate, how thoroughly I wish you well.\"\n\nUpon this Clara got up to take her leave, and the demonstrative\naffection of an embrace between the two women afforded a remedy for\nthe awkwardness of the previous conversation.\n\n\"God bless you, dearest,\" said Mrs. Askerton. \"May I write to you?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Clara.\n\n\"And you will answer my letters?\"\n\n\"Of course I will. You must tell me everything about the place;--and\nespecially as to Bessy. Bessy is never to be sold;--is she, Will?\"\nBessy was the cow which Belton had given her.\n\n\"Not if you choose to keep her.\"\n\n\"I will go down and see to her myself,\" said Mrs. Askerton, \"and will\nutter little prayers of my own over her horns,--that certain events\nthat I desire may come to pass. Good-bye, Mr. Belton. You may be as\nungracious as you please, but it will not make any difference.\"\n\nWhen Clara and her cousin left the cottage they did not return to the\nhouse immediately, but took a last walk round the park, and through\nthe shrubbery, and up to the rocks on which a remarkable scene had\nonce taken place between them. Few words were spoken as they were\nwalking, and there had been no agreement as to the path they would\ntake. Each seemed to understand that there was much of melancholy in\ntheir present mood, and that silence was more fitting than speech.\nBut when they reached the rocks Belton sat himself down, asking\nClara's leave to stop there for a moment. \"I don't suppose I shall\never come to this place again,\" said he.\n\n\"You are as bad as Mrs. Askerton,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I do not think I shall ever come to this place again,\" said he,\nrepeating his words very solemnly. \"At any rate, I will never do so\nwillingly, unless--\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Unless you are either my wife, or have promised to become so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Will; you know that that is impossible.\"\n\n\"Then it is impossible that I should come here again.\"\n\n\"You know that I am engaged to another man.\"\n\n\"Of course I do. I am not asking you to break your engagement. I am\nsimply telling you that in spite of that engagement I love you as\nwell as I did love you before you had made it. I have a right to let\nyou know the truth.\" As if she had not known it without his telling\nit to her now! \"It was here that I told you that I loved you. I now\nrepeat it here; and will never come here again unless I may say the\nsame thing over and over and over. That is all. We might as well go\non now.\" But when he got up she sat down, as though unwilling to\nleave the spot. It was still winter, and the rock was damp with cold\ndrippings from the trees, and the moss around was wet, and little\npools of water had formed themselves in the shallow holes upon the\nsurface. She did not speak as she seated herself; but he was of\ncourse obliged to wait till she should be ready to accompany him. \"It\nis too cold for you to sit there,\" he said. \"Come, Clara; I will not\nhave you loiter here. It is cold and wet.\"\n\n\"It is not colder for me than for you.\"\n\n\"You are not used to that sort of thing as I am.\"\n\n\"Will,\" she said, \"you must never speak to me again as you spoke just\nnow. Promise me that you will not.\"\n\n\"Promises will do no good in such a matter.\"\n\n\"It is almost a repetition of what you did before;--though of course\nit is not so bad as that.\"\n\n\"Everything I do is bad.\"\n\n\"No, Will:--dear Will! Almost everything you do is good. But of what\nuse can it be to either of us for you to be thinking of that which\ncan never be? Cannot you think of me as your sister,--and only as\nyour sister?\"\n\n\"No; I cannot.\"\n\n\"Then it is not right that we should be together.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of right. You ask me a question, and I suppose you\ndon't wish that I should tell you a lie.\"\n\n\"Of course I do not wish that.\"\n\n\"Therefore I tell you the truth. I love you,--as any other man loves\nthe girl that he does love; and, as far as I know myself now, I never\ncan be happy unless you are my own.\"\n\n\"Oh, Will, how can that be when I am engaged to marry another man?\"\n\n\"As to your engagement I should care nothing. Does he love you as I\nlove you? If he loves you, why is he not here? If he loves you, why\ndoes he let his mother ill-use you, and treat you with scorn? If he\nloves you as I love you, how could he write to you as he does write?\nWould I write to you such a letter as that? Would I let you be here\nwithout coming to you,--to be looked after by any one else? If you\nhad said that you would be my wife, would I leave you in solitude and\nsorrow, and then send you seventy-five pounds to console you? If you\nthink he loves you, Clara--\"\n\n\"He thought he was doing right when he sent me the money.\"\n\n\"But he shouldn't have thought it right. Never mind. I don't want to\naccuse him; but this I know,--and you know; he does not love you as I\nlove you.\"\n\n\"What can I say to answer you?\"\n\n\"Say that you will wait till you have seen him. Say that I may have a\nhope,--a chance; that if he is cold, and hard, and,--and,--and, just\nwhat we know he is, then I may have a chance.\"\n\n\"How can I say that when I am engaged to him? Cannot you understand\nthat I am wrong to let you speak of him as you do?\"\n\n\"How else am I to speak of him? Tell me this. Do you love him?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I do.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\"\n\n\"Will!\"\n\n\"I don't believe it. Nothing on earth shall make me believe it. It is\nimpossible;--impossible!\"\n\n\"Do you mean to insult me, Will?\"\n\n\"No; I do not mean to insult you, but I mean to tell you the truth. I\ndo not think you love that man as you ought to love the man whom you\nare going to marry. I should tell you just the same thing if I were\nreally your brother. Of course it isn't that I suppose you love any\none else,--me for instance. I'm not such a fool as that. But I don't\nthink you love him; and I'm quite sure he doesn't love you. That's\njust what I believe; and if I do believe it, how am I to help telling\nyou?\"\n\n\"You've no right to have such beliefs.\"\n\n\"How am I to help it? Well;--never mind. I won't let you sit there\nany longer. At any rate you'll be able to understand now that I shall\nnever come to this place any more.\" Clara, as she got up to obey him,\nfelt that she also ought never to see it again;--unless,\nindeed,--unless--\n\nThey passed that evening together without any reference to the scene\non the rock, or any allusion to their own peculiar troubles. Clara,\nthough she would not admit to Mrs. Askerton that she was going away\nfrom the place for ever, was not the less aware that such might very\nprobably be the case. She had no longer any rights of ownership at\nBelton Castle, and all that had taken place between her and her\ncousin tended to make her feel that under no circumstances could she\nagain reside there. Nor was it probable that she would be able to\nmake to Mrs. Askerton the visit of which they had been talking. If\nLady Aylmer were wise,--so Clara thought,--there would be no mention\nof Mrs. Askerton at Aylmer Park; and, if so, of course she would not\noutrage her future husband by proposing to go to a house of which\nshe knew that he disapproved. If Lady Aylmer were not wise;--if\nshe should take upon herself the task of rebuking Clara for her\nfriendship,--then, in such circumstances as those, Clara believed\nthat the visit to Mrs. Askerton might be possible.\n\nBut she determined that she would leave the home in which she had\nbeen born, and had passed so many happy and so many unhappy days, as\nthough she were never to see it again. All her packing had been done,\ndown to the last fragment of an old letter that was stuffed into her\nwriting-desk; but, nevertheless, she went about the house with a\ncandle in her hand, as though she were still looking that nothing had\nbeen omitted, while she was in truth saying farewell in her heart to\nevery corner which she knew so well. When at last she came down to\npour out for her desolate cousin his cup of tea, she declared that\neverything was done. \"You may go to work now, Will,\" she said, \"and\ndo what you please with the old place. My jurisdiction in it is\nover.\"\n\n\"Not altogether,\" said he. He no longer spoke like a despairing\nlover. Indeed there was a smile round his mouth, and his voice was\ncheery.\n\n\"Yes;--altogether. I give over my sovereignty from this moment;--and\na dirty dilapidated sovereignty it is.\"\n\n\"That's all very well to say.\"\n\n\"And also very well to do. What best pleases me in going to Aylmer\nCastle just now is the power it gives me of doing at once that which\notherwise I might have put off till the doing of it had become much\nmore unpleasant. Mr. Belton, there is the key of the cellar,--which\nI believe gentlemen always regard as the real sign of possession. I\ndon't advise you to trust much to the contents.\" He took the key from\nher, and without saying a word chucked it across the room on to an\nold sofa. \"If you won't take it, you had better, at any rate, have it\ntied up with the others,\" she said.\n\n\"I dare say you'll know where to find it when you want it,\" he\nanswered.\n\n\"I shall never want it.\"\n\n\"Then it's as well there as anywhere else.\"\n\n\"But you won't remember, Will.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose I shall have occasion for remembering.\" Then he\npaused a moment before he went on. \"I have told you before that I do\nnot intend to take possession of the place. I do not regard it as\nmine at all.\"\n\n\"And whose is it, then?\"\n\n\"Yours.\"\n\n\"No, dear Will; it is not mine. You know that.\"\n\n\"I intend that it shall be so, and therefore you might as well put\nthe keys where you will know how to find them.\"\n\nAfter he had gone she did take up the key, and tied it with sundry\nothers, which she intended to give to the old servant who was to be\nleft in charge of the house. But after a few moments' consideration\nshe took the cellar key again off the bunch, and put it back upon the\nsofa,--in the place to which he had thrown it.\n\nOn the following morning they started on their journey. The old fly\nfrom Redicote was not used on this occasion, as Belton had ordered a\npair of post-horses and a comfortable carriage from Taunton. \"I think\nit such a shame,\" said Clara, \"going away for the last time without\nhaving Jerry and the grey horse.\" Jerry was the man who had once\ndriven her to Taunton when the old horse fell with her on the road.\n\"But Jerry and the grey horse could not have taken you and me too,\nand all our luggage,\" said Will. \"Poor Jerry! I suppose not,\" said\nClara; \"but still there is an injury done in going without him.\"\n\nThere were four or five old dependents of the family standing round\nthe door to bid her adieu, to all of whom she gave her hand with a\ncordial pressure. They, at least, seemed to regard her departure as\nfinal. And of course it was final. She had assured herself of that\nduring the night. And just as they were about to start, both Colonel\nand Mrs. Askerton walked up to the door. \"He wouldn't let you go\nwithout bidding you farewell,\" said Mrs. Askerton. \"I am so glad to\nshake hands with him,\" Clara answered. Then the Colonel spoke a word\nto her, and, as he did so, his wife contrived to draw Will Belton for\na moment behind the carriage. \"Never give it up, Mr. Belton,\" said\nshe, eagerly. \"If you persevere she'll be yours yet.\" \"I fear not,\"\nhe said. \"Stick to her like a man,\" said she, pressing his hand in\nher vehemence. \"If you do, you'll live to thank me for having told\nyou so.\" Will had not a word to say for himself, but he thought that\nhe would stick to her. Indeed, he thought that he had stuck to her\npretty well.\n\nAt last they were off, and the village of Belton was behind them.\nWill, glancing into his cousin's face, saw that her eyes were laden\nwith tears, and refrained from speaking. As they passed the ugly\nred-brick rectory-house, Clara for a moment put her face to the\nwindow, and then withdrew it. \"There is nobody there,\" she said, \"who\nwill care to see me. Considering that I have lived here all my life,\nis it not odd that there should be so few to bid me good-bye?\"\n\n\"People do not like to put themselves forward on such occasions,\"\nsaid Will.\n\n\"People!--there are no people. No one ever had so few to care for\nthem as I have. And now--. But never mind; I mean to do very well,\nand I shall do very well.\" Belton would not take advantage of her in\nher sadness, and they reached the station at Taunton almost without\nanother word.\n\nOf course they had to wait there for half an hour, and of course the\nwaiting was very tedious. To Will it was very tedious indeed, as he\nwas not by nature good at waiting. To Clara, who on this occasion\nsat perfectly still in the waiting-room, with her toes on the fender\nbefore the fire, the evil of the occasion was not so severe. \"The man\nwould take two hours for the journey, though I told him an hour and a\nhalf would be enough,\" said Will, querulously.\n\n\"But we might have had an accident.\"\n\n\"An accident! What accident? People don't have accidents every day.\"\n\nAt last the train came and they started. Clara, though she had with\nher her best friend,--I may almost say the friend whom in the world\nshe loved the best,--did not have an agreeable journey. Belton would\nnot talk; but as he made no attempt at reading, Clara did not like\nto have recourse to the book which she had in her travelling-bag. He\nsat opposite to her, opening the window and shutting it as he thought\nshe might like it, but looking wretched and forlorn. At Swindon\nhe brightened up for a moment under the excitement of getting her\nsomething to eat, but that relaxation lasted only for a few minutes.\nAfter that he relapsed again into silence till the train had passed\nSlough, and he knew that in another half-hour they would be in\nLondon. Then he leant over her and spoke.\n\n\"This will probably be the last opportunity I shall have of saying a\nfew words to you,--alone.\"\n\n\"I don't know that at all, Will.\"\n\n\"It will be the last for a long time at any rate. And as I have got\nsomething to say, I might as well say it now. I have thought a great\ndeal about the property,--the Belton estate, I mean; and I don't\nintend to take it as mine.\n\n\"That is sheer nonsense, Will. You must take it, as it is yours, and\ncan't belong to any one else.\"\n\n\"I have thought it over, and I am quite sure that all the business of\nthe entail was wrong,--radically wrong from first to last. You are to\nunderstand that my special regard for you has nothing whatever to do\nwith it. I should do the same thing if I felt that I hated you.\"\n\n\"Don't hate me, Will!\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. I think the entail was all wrong, and I shan't\ntake advantage of it. It's not common sense that I should have\neverything because of poor Charley's misfortune.\"\n\n\"But it seems to me that it does not depend upon you or upon me, or\nupon anybody. It is yours,--by law, you know.\"\n\n\"And therefore it won't be sufficient for me to give it up without\nmaking it yours by law also,--which I intend to do. I shall stay in\ntown to-morrow and give instructions to Mr. Green. I have thought\nit proper to tell you this now, in order that you may mention it to\nCaptain Aylmer.\"\n\nThey were leaning over in the carriage one towards the other; her\nface had been slightly turned away from him; but now she slowly\nraised her eyes till they met his, and looking into the depth of\nthem, and seeing there all his love and all his suffering, and the\ngreat nobility of his nature, her heart melted within her. Gradually,\nas her tears came,--would come, in spite of all her constraint, she\nagain turned her face towards the window. \"I can't talk now,\" she\nsaid, \"indeed I can't.\"\n\n\"There is no need for any more talking about it,\" he replied. And\nthere was no more talking between them on that subject, or on any\nother, till the tickets had been taken and the train was again in\nmotion. Then he referred to it again for a moment. \"You will tell\nCaptain Aylmer, my dear.\"\n\n\"I will tell him what you say, that he may know your generosity. But\nof course he will agree with me that no such offer can be accepted.\nIt is quite,--quite,--quite,--out of the question.\"\n\n\"You had better tell him and say nothing more; or you can ask him\nto see Mr. Green,--after to-morrow. He, as a man who understands\nbusiness, will know that this arrangement must be made, if I choose\nto make it. Come; here we are. Porter, a four-wheeled cab. Do you go\nwith him, and I'll look after the luggage.\"\n\nClara, as she got into the cab, felt that she ought to have been\nmore stout in her resistance to his offer. But it would be better,\nperhaps, that she should write to him from Aylmer Park, and get\nFrederic to write also.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nTHE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY HOTEL.\n\n\nAt the door of the hotel of the Great Northern Railway Station they\nmet Captain Aylmer. Rooms had been taken there because they were to\nstart by an early train on that line in the morning, and Captain\nAylmer had undertaken to order dinner. There was nothing particular\nin the meeting to make it unpleasant to our friend Will. The\nfortunate rival could do no more in the hall of the inn than give his\nhand to his affianced bride, as he might do to any other lady, and\nthen suggest to her that she should go up-stairs and see her room.\nWhen he had done this, he also offered his hand to Belton; and Will,\nthough he would almost sooner have cut off his own, was obliged to\ntake it. In a few minutes the two men were standing alone together in\nthe sitting-room.\n\n\"I suppose you found it cold coming up?\" said the captain.\n\n\"Not particularly,\" said Will.\n\n\"It's rather a long journey from Belton.\"\n\n\"Not very long,\" said Will.\n\n\"Not for you, perhaps; but Miss Amedroz must be tired.\"\n\nBelton was angry at having his cousin called Miss Amedroz,--feeling\nthat the reserve of the name was intended to keep him at a distance.\nBut he would have been equally angry had Aylmer called her Clara.\n\n\"My cousin,\" said Will stoutly, \"is able to bear slight fatigue of\nthat kind without suffering.\"\n\n\"I didn't suppose she suffered; but journeys are always tedious,\nespecially where there is so much road work. I believe you are twenty\nmiles from the station?\"\n\n\"Belton Castle is something over twenty miles from Taunton.\"\n\n\"We are seven from our station at Aylmer Park, and we think that a\ngreat deal.\"\n\n\"I'm more than that at Plaistow,\" said Will.\n\n\"Oh, indeed. Plaistow is in Norfolk, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes;--Plaistow is in Norfolk.\"\n\n\"I suppose you'll leave it now and go into Somersetshire,\" suggested\nCaptain Aylmer.\n\n\"Certainly not. Why should I leave it?\"\n\n\"I thought, perhaps,--as Belton Castle is now your own--\"\n\n\"Plaistow Hall is more my own than Belton Castle, if that signifies\nanything,--which it doesn't.\" This he said in an angry tone, which,\nas he became conscious of it, he tried to rectify. \"I've a deal of\nstock and all that sort of thing at Plaistow, and couldn't very well\nleave it, even if I wished it,\" he said.\n\n\"You've pretty good shooting too, I suppose,\" said Aylmer.\n\n\"As far as partridges go I'll back it against most properties of the\nsame extent in any county.\"\n\n\"I'm too busy a man myself,\" said the Captain, \"to do much at\npartridges. We think more of pheasants down with us.\"\n\n\"I dare say.\"\n\n\"But a Norfolk man like you is of course keen about birds.\"\n\n\"We are obliged to put up with what we've got, you know;--not but\nwhat I believe there is a better general head of game in Norfolk than\nin any other county in England.\"\n\n\"That's what makes your hunting rather poor.\"\n\n\"Our hunting poor! Why do you say it's poor?\"\n\n\"So many of you are against preserving foxes.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Captain Aylmer; I don't know what pack you\nhunt with, but I'll bet you a five-pound note that we killed more\nfoxes last year than you did;--that is, taking three days a week.\nNine-and-twenty brace and a half in a short season I don't call poor\nat all.\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer saw that the man was waxing angry, and made no further\nallusion either to the glories or deficiencies of Norfolk. As he\ncould think of no other subject on which to speak at the spur of\nthe moment, he sat himself down and took up a paper; Belton took up\nanother, and so they remained till Clara made her appearance. That\nCaptain Aylmer read his paper is probable enough. He was not a man\neasily disconcerted, and there was nothing in his present position\nto disconcert him. But I feel sure that Will Belton did not read a\nword. He was angry with this rival, whom he hated, and was angry with\nhimself for showing his anger. He would have wished to appear to the\nbest advantage before this man, or rather before Clara in this man's\npresence; and he knew that in Clara's absence he was making such a\nfool of himself that he would be unable to recover his prestige. He\nhad serious thoughts within his own breast whether it would not be\nas well for him to get up from his seat and give Captain Aylmer a\nthoroughly good thrashing;--\"Drop into him and punch his head,\" as\nhe himself would have expressed it. For the moment such an exercise\nwould give him immense gratification. The final results would, no\ndoubt, be disastrous; but then, all future results, as far as he\ncould see them, were laden with disaster. He was still thinking of\nthis, eyeing the man from under the newspaper, and telling himself\nthat the feat would probably be too easy to afford much enjoyment,\nwhen Clara re-entered the room. Then he got up, acting on the spur of\nthe moment,--got up quickly and suddenly, and began to bid her adieu.\n\n\"But you are going to dine here, Will?\" she said.\n\n\"No; I think not.\"\n\n\"You promised you would. You told me you had nothing to do to-night.\"\nThen she turned to Captain Aylmer. \"You expect my cousin to dine with\nus to-day?\"\n\n\"I ordered dinner for three,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"Oh, very well; it's all the same thing to me,\" said Will.\n\n\"And to me,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"It's not at all the same thing to me,\" said Clara. \"I don't know\nwhen I may see my cousin again. I should think it very bad of you,\nWill, if you went away this evening.\"\n\n\"I'll go out just for half an hour,\" said he, \"and be back to\ndinner.\"\n\n\"We dine at seven,\" said the Captain. Then Belton took his hat and\nleft the two lovers together.\n\n\"Your cousin seems to be a rather surly sort of gentleman.\" Those\nwere the first words which Captain Aylmer spoke when he was alone\nwith the lady of his love. Nor was he demonstrative of his affection\nby any of the usual signs of regard which are permitted to accepted\nlovers. He did not offer to kiss her, nor did he attempt to take\nher hand with a warmer pressure now that he was alone with her. He\nprobably might have gone through some such ceremony had he first met\nClara in a position propitious to such purposes; but, as it was, he\nhad been a little ruffled by Will Belton's want of good breeding, and\nhad probably forgotten that any such privileges might have been his.\nI wonder whether any remembrance flashed across Clara's mind at this\nmoment of her cousin Will's great iniquity in the sitting-room at\nBelton Castle. She thought of it very often, and may possibly have\nthought of it now.\n\n\"I don't believe that he is surly, Frederic,\" she said. \"He may,\nperhaps, be out of humour.\"\n\n\"And why should he be out of humour with me? I only suggested to him\nthat it might suit him to live at Belton instead of at that farm of\nhis, down in Norfolk.\"\n\n\"He is very fond of Plaistow, I fancy.\"\n\n\"But that's no reason why he should be cross with me. I don't envy\nhim his taste, that's all. If he can't understand that he, with his\nname, ought to live on the family property which belongs to him, it\nisn't likely that anything that I can say will open his eyes upon the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Frederic, he has some romantic notion about the Belton\nestate.\"\n\n\"What romantic notion?\"\n\n\"He thinks it should not be his at all.\"\n\n\"Whose then? Who does he think should have it?\"\n\n\"Of course there can be nothing in it, you know; of course it's all\nnonsense.\"\n\n\"But what is his idea? Who does he think should be the owner?\"\n\n\"He means--that it should be--mine. But of course, Frederic, it is\nall nonsense; we know that.\"\n\nIt did not seem to be quite clear at the moment that Frederic had\naltogether made up his mind upon the subject. As he heard these\ntidings from Clara there came across his face a puzzled, dubious\nlook, as though he did not quite understand the proposition which\nhad been suggested to him;--as though some consideration were wanted\nbefore he could take the idea home to himself and digest it, so as\nto enable himself to express an opinion upon it. There might be\nsomething in it,--some show of reason which did not make itself clear\nto Clara's feminine mind. \"I have never known what was the precise\nnature of your father's marriage settlement,\" said he.\n\nThen Clara began to explain with exceeding eagerness that there was\nno question as to the accuracy of the settlement, or the legality\nof the entail;--that indeed there was no question as to anything.\nHer cousin Will was romantic, and that was the end of it. Of\ncourse,--quite as a matter of course, this romance would lead to\nnothing; and she had only mentioned the subject now to show that her\ncousin's mind might possibly be disturbed when the question of his\nfuture residence was raised. \"I quite feel with you,\" she said, \"that\nit will be much nicer that he should live at the old family place;\nbut just at present I do not speak about it.\"\n\n\"If he is thinking of not claiming Belton, it is quite another\nthing,\" said Aylmer.\n\n\"It is his without any claiming,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Ah, well; it will all be settled before long,\" said Aylmer.\n\n\"It is settled already,\" said Clara.\n\nAt seven the three met again, and when the dinner was on the table\nthere was some little trouble as to the helping of the fish. Which of\nthe two men should take the lead on the occasion? But Clara decided\nthe question by asking her cousin to make himself useful. There can\nbe little doubt but that Captain Aylmer would have distributed the\nmutton chops with much more grace, and have carved the roast fowl\nwith much more skill; but it suited Clara that Will should have the\nemployment, and Will did the work. Captain Aylmer, throughout the\ndinner, endeavoured to be complaisant, and Clara exerted herself to\ntalk as though all matters around them were easy. Will, too, made his\neffort, every now and then speaking a word, and restraining himself\nfrom snapping at his rival; but the restraint was in itself evident,\nand there were symptoms throughout the dinner that the untamed man\nwas longing to fly at the throat of the man that was tamed.\n\n\"Is it supposed that I ought to go away for a little while?\" said\nClara, as soon as she had drank her own glass of wine.\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" said the Captain. \"We'll have a cup of coffee;--that\nis, if Mr. Belton likes it.\"\n\n\"It's all the same to me,\" said Will.\n\n\"But won't you have some more wine?\" Clara asked.\n\n\"No more for me,\" said Captain Aylmer. \"Perhaps Mr. Belton--\"\n\n\"Who; I? No; I don't want any more wine,\" said Will; and then they\nwere all silent.\n\nIt was very hard upon Clara. After a while the coffee came, and even\nthat was felt to be a comfort. Though there was no pouring out to\nbe done, no actual employment enacted, still the manoeuvring of the\ncups created a diversion. \"If either of you like to smoke,\" she said,\n\"I shan't mind it in the least.\" But neither of them would smoke. \"At\nwhat hour shall we get to Aylmer Park to-morrow?\" Clara asked.\n\n\"At half-past four,\" said the Captain.\n\n\"Oh, indeed;--so early as that.\" What was she to say next? Will, who\nhad not touched his coffee, and who was sitting stiffly at the table\nas though he were bound in duty not to move, was becoming more and\nmore grim every moment. She almost repented that she had asked him\nto remain with them. Certainly there was no comfort in his company,\neither to them or to himself. \"How long shall you remain in town,\nWill, before you go down to Plaistow?\" she asked.\n\n\"One day,\" he replied.\n\n\"Give my kind love,--my very kindest love to Mary. I wish I knew her.\nI wish I could think that I might soon know her.\"\n\n\"You'll never know her,\" said Belton. The tone of his voice was\nactually savage as he spoke;--so much so that Aylmer turned in his\nchair to look at him, and Clara did not dare to answer him. But now\nthat he had been made to speak, it seemed that he was determined to\npersevere. \"How should you ever know her? Nothing will ever bring you\ninto Norfolk, and nothing will ever take her out of it.\"\n\n\"I don't quite see why either of those assertions should be made.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless they're both true. Had you ever meant to come to\nNorfolk you would have come now.\" He had not even asked her to come,\nhaving arranged with his sister that in their existing circumstances\nany such asking would not be a kindness; and yet he rebuked her now\nfor not coming!\n\n\"My mother is very anxious that Miss Amedroz should pay her a visit\nat Aylmer Park,\" said the Captain.\n\n\"And she's going to Aylmer Park, so your mother's anxiety need not\ndisturb her any longer.\"\n\n\"Come, Will, don't be out of temper with us,\" said Clara. \"It is our\nlast night together. We, who are so dear to each other, ought not to\nquarrel.\"\n\n\"I'm not quarrelling with you,\" said he.\n\n\"I can hardly suppose that Mr. Belton wants to quarrel with me,\" said\nCaptain Aylmer, smiling.\n\n\"I'm sure he does not,\" said Clara. Belton sat silent, with his eyes\nfixed upon the table, and with a dark frown upon his brow. He did\nlong to quarrel with Captain Aylmer; but was still anxious, if it\nmight be possible, to save himself from what he knew would be a\ntransgression.\n\n\"To use a phrase common with us down in Yorkshire,\" said Aylmer, \"I\nshould say that Mr. Belton had got out of bed the wrong side this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"What the d---- does it matter to you, sir, what side I got out of\nbed?\" said Will, clenching both his fists. Oh;--if he might only have\nbeen allowed to have a round of five minutes with Aylmer, he would\nhave been restored to good temper for that night, let the subsequent\nresults have been what they might. He moved his feet impatiently on\nthe floor, as though he were longing to kick something; and then he\npushed his coffee-cup away from him, upsetting half the contents upon\nthe table, and knocking down a wine-glass, which was broken.\n\n\"Will;--Will!\" said Clara, looking at him with imploring eyes.\n\n\"Then he shouldn't talk to me about getting out of bed on the wrong\nside. I didn't say anything to him.\"\n\n\"It is unkind of you, Will, to quarrel with Captain Aylmer because he\nis my friend.\"\n\n\"I don't want to quarrel with him; or, rather, as I won't quarrel\nwith him because you don't wish it, I'll go away. I can't do more\nthan that. I didn't want to dine with him here. There's my cousin\nClara, Captain Aylmer; I love her better than all the world besides.\nLove her! It seems to me that there's nothing else in the world for\nme to love. I'd give my heart for her this minute. All that I have in\nthe world is hers. Oh,--love her! I don't believe that it's in you\nto know what I mean when I say that I love her! She tells me that\nshe's going to be your wife. You can't suppose that I can be very\ncomfortable under those circumstances,--or that I can be very fond of\nyou. I'm not very fond of you. Now I'll go away, and then I shan't\ntrouble you any more. But look here,--if ever you should ill-treat\nher, whether you marry her or whether you don't, I'll crush every\nbone in your skin.\" Having so spoken he went to the door, but stopped\nhimself before he left the room. \"Good-bye, Clara. I've got a word or\ntwo more to say to you, but I'll write you a line down-stairs. You\ncan show it to him if you please. It'll only be about business.\nGood-night.\"\n\nShe had got up and followed him to the door, and he had taken her by\nthe hand. \"You shouldn't let your passion get the better of you in\nthis way,\" she said; but the tone of her voice was very soft, and her\neyes were full of love.\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said he.\n\n\"I can forgive him,\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"D---- your forgiveness,\" said Will Belton. Then Clara dropped the\nhand and started back, and the door was shut, and Will Belton was\ngone.\n\n\"Your cousin seems to be a nice sort of young man,\" said Aylmer.\n\n\"Cannot you understand it all, Frederic, and pardon him?\"\n\n\"I can pardon him easily enough; but one doesn't like men who are\ngiven to threatening. He's not the sort of man that I took him to\nbe.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I think he's as nearly perfect as a man can be.\"\n\n\"Then you like men to swear at you, and to swagger like Bobadils,\nand to misbehave themselves, so that one has to blush for them if\na servant chances to hear them. Do you really think that he has\nconducted himself to-day like a gentleman?\"\n\n\"I know that he is a gentleman,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I must confess I have no reason for supposing him to be so but your\nassurance.\"\n\n\"And I hope that is sufficient, Frederic.\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer did not answer her at once, but sat for awhile silent,\nconsidering what he would say. Clara, who understood his moods, knew\nthat he did not mean to drop the subject, and resolved that she would\ndefend her cousin, let Captain Aylmer attack him as he would.\n\n\"Upon my word, I hardly know what to say about it,\" said Aylmer.\n\n\"Suppose, then, that we say nothing more. Will not that be best?\"\n\n\"No, Clara. I cannot now let the matter pass by in that way. You have\nasked me whether I do not think Mr. Belton to be a gentleman, and I\nmust say that I doubt it. Pray hear me out before you answer me. I\ndo not want to be harder upon him than I can help; and I would have\nborne, and I did bear from him, a great deal in silence. But he said\nthat to me which I cannot allow to pass without notice. He had the\nbad taste to speak to me of his--his regard for you.\"\n\n\"I cannot see what harm he did by that;--except to himself.\"\n\n\"I believe that it is understood among gentlemen that one man never\nspeaks to another man about the lady the other man means to marry,\nunless they are very intimate friends indeed. What I mean is, that if\nMr. Belton had understood how gentlemen live together he would never\nhave said anything to me about his affection for you. He should at\nany rate have supposed me to be ignorant of it. There is something\nin the very idea of his doing so that is in the highest degree\nindelicate. I wonder, Clara, that you do not see this yourself.\"\n\n\"I think he was indiscreet.\"\n\n\"Indiscreet! Indiscreet is not the word for such conduct. I must say,\nthat as far as my opinion goes, it was ungentlemanlike.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that there is a nobler-minded gentleman in all\nLondon than my cousin Will.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it gratified you to hear from him the assurance of his\nlove?\" said Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"If it is your wish to insult me, Frederic, I will leave you.\"\n\n\"It is my wish to make you understand that your judgment has been\nwrong.\"\n\n\"That is simply a matter of opinion, and as I do not wish to argue\nwith you about it, I had better go. At any rate I am very tired.\nGood-night, Frederic.\" He then told her what arrangements he had made\nfor the morrow, at what hour she would be called, and when she would\nhave her breakfast. After that he let her go without making any\nfurther allusion to Will Belton.\n\nIt must be admitted that the meeting between the lovers had not been\nauspicious; and it must be acknowledged, also, that Will Belton had\nbehaved very badly. I am not aware of the existence of that special\nunderstanding among gentlemen in respect to the ladies they are\ngoing to marry which Captain Aylmer so eloquently described; but,\nnevertheless, I must confess that Belton would have done better had\nhe kept his feelings to himself. And when he talked of crushing his\nrival's bones, he laid himself justly open to severe censure. But,\nfor all that, he was no Bobadil. He was angry, sore, and miserable;\nand in his anger, soreness, and misery, he had allowed himself to\nbe carried away. He felt very keenly his own folly, even as he was\nleaving the room, and as he made his way out of the hotel he hated\nhimself for his own braggadocio. \"I wish some one would crush my\nbones,\" he said to himself almost audibly. \"No one ever deserved to\nbe crushed better than I do.\"\n\nClara, when she got to her own room, was very serious and very sad.\nWhat was to be the end of it all? This had been her first meeting\nafter her father's death with the man whom she had promised to marry;\nindeed, it was the first meeting after her promise had been given;\nand they had only met to quarrel. There had been no word of love\nspoken between them. She had parted from him now almost in anger,\nwithout the slightest expression of confidence between them,--almost\nas those part who are constrained by circumstances to be together,\nbut who yet hate each other and know that they hate each other. Was\nthere in truth any love between him and her? And if there was none,\ncould there be any advantage, any good either to him or to her, in\nthis journey of hers to Aylmer Park? Would it not be better that she\nshould send for him and tell him that they were not suited for each\nother, and that thus she should escape from all the terrors of Lady\nAylmer? As she thought of this, she could not but think of Will\nBelton also. Not a gentleman! If Will Belton was not a gentleman, she\ndesired to know nothing further of gentlemen. Women are so good and\nkind that those whom they love they love almost the more when they\ncommit offences, because of the offences so committed. Will Belton\nhad been guilty of great offences,--of offences for which Clara was\nprepared to lecture him in the gravest manner should opportunities\nfor such lectures ever come;--but I think that they had increased\nher regard for him rather than diminished it. She could not, however,\nmake up her mind to send for Captain Aylmer, and when she went to bed\nshe had resolved that the visit to Yorkshire must be made.\n\nBefore she left the room the following morning, a letter was brought\nto her from her cousin, which had been written that morning. She\nasked the maid to inquire for him, and sent down word to him that if\nhe were in the house she specially wished to see him; but the tidings\ncame from the hall porter that he had gone out very early, and had\nexpressly said that he should not breakfast at the inn.\n\nThe letter was as follows:--\n\n\n   DEAR CLARA,\n\n   I meant to have handed to you the enclosed in person, but\n   I lost my temper last night,--like a fool as I am,--and so\n   I couldn't do it. You need not have any scruple about the\n   money which I send,--\u00c2\u00a3100 in ten ten-pound notes,--as it\n   is your own. There is the rent due up to your father's\n   death, which is more than what I now enclose, and there\n   will be a great many other items, as to all of which you\n   shall have a proper account. When you want more, you had\n   better draw on me, till things are settled. It shall all\n   be done as soon as possible. It would not be comfortable\n   for you to go away without money of your own, and I\n   suppose you would not wish that he should pay for your\n   journeys and things before you are married.\n\n   Of course I made a fool of myself yesterday. I believe\n   that I usually do. It is not any good my begging your\n   pardon, for I don't suppose I shall ever trouble you any\n   more. Good-bye, and God bless you.\n\n   Your affectionate Cousin,\n\n   WILLIAM BELTON.\n\n   It was a bad day for me when I made up my mind to go to\n   Belton Castle last summer.\n\n\nClara, when she had read the letter, sat down and cried, holding the\nbundle of notes in her hand. What would she do with them? Should she\nsend them back? Oh no;--she would do nothing to displease him, or to\nmake him think that she was angry with him. Besides, she had none of\nthat dislike to taking his money which she had felt as to receiving\nmoney from Captain Aylmer. He had said that she would be his sister,\nand she would take from him any assistance that a sister might\nproperly take from a brother.\n\nShe went down-stairs and met Captain Aylmer in the sitting-room. He\nstepped up to her as soon as the door was closed, and she could at\nonce see that he had determined to forget the unpleasantnesses of the\nprevious evening. He stepped up to her, and gracefully taking her by\none hand, and passing the other behind her waist, saluted her in a\nbecoming and appropriate manner. She did not like it. She especially\ndisliked it, believing in her heart of hearts that she would never\nbecome the wife of this man whom she had professed to love,--and whom\nshe really had once loved. But she could only bear it. And, to say\nthe truth, there was not much suffering of that kind to be borne.\n\nTheir journey down to Yorkshire was very prosperous. He maintained\nhis good humour throughout the day, and never once said a word about\nWill Belton. Nor did he say a word about Mrs. Askerton. \"Do your best\nto please my mother, Clara,\" he said, as they were driving up from\nthe park lodges to the house. This was fair enough, and she therefore\npromised him that she would do her best.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nMISS AMEDROZ HAS SOME HASHED CHICKEN.\n\n\nClara felt herself to be a coward as the Aylmer Park carriage, which\nhad been sent to meet her at the station, was drawn up at Sir Anthony\nAylmer's door. She had made up her mind that she would not bow down\nto Lady Aylmer, and yet she was afraid of the woman. As she got out\nof the carriage, she looked up, expecting to see her in the hall;\nbut Lady Aylmer was too accurately acquainted with the weights and\nmeasures of society for any such movement as that. Had her son\nbrought Lady Emily to the house as his future bride, Lady Aylmer\nwould probably have been in the hall when the arrival took place;\nand had Clara possessed ten thousand pounds of her own, she would\nprobably have been met at the drawing-room door; but as she had\nneither money nor title,--as she in fact brought with her no\nadvantages of any sort, Lady Aylmer was found stitching a bit of\nworsted, as though she had expected no one to come to her. And\nBelinda Aylmer was stitching also,--by special order from her mother.\nThe reader will remember that Lady Aylmer was not without strong\nhope that the engagement might even yet be broken off. Snubbing, she\nthought, might probably be efficacious to this purpose, and so Clara\nwas to be snubbed.\n\nClara, who had just promised to do her best to gain Lady Aylmer's\nopinion, and who desired to be in some way true to her promise,\nthough she thoroughly believed that her labour would be in vain, put\non her pleasantest smile as she entered the room. Belinda, under the\npressure of the circumstances, forgetting somewhat of her mother's\ninjunctions, hurried to the door to welcome the stranger. Lady Aylmer\nkept her chair, and even maintained her stitch, till Clara was half\nacross the room. Then she got up, and, with great mastery over her\nvoice, made her little speech.\n\n\"We are delighted to see you, Miss Amedroz,\" she said, putting out\nher hand,--of which Clara, however, felt no more than the finger.\n\n\"Quite delighted,\" said Belinda, yielding a fuller grasp. Then there\nwere affectionate greetings between Frederic and his mother and\nFrederic and his sister, during which Clara stood by, ill at ease.\nCaptain Aylmer said not a word as to the footing on which his future\nwife had come to his father's house. He did not ask his mother to\nreceive her as another daughter, or his sister to take his Clara to\nher heart as a sister. There had been no word spoken of recognised\nintimacy. Clara knew that the Aylmers were cold people. She had\nlearned as much as that from Captain Aylmer's words to herself, and\nfrom his own manner. But she had not expected to be so frozen by them\nas was the case with her now. In ten minutes she was sitting down\nwith her bonnet still on, and Lady Aylmer was again at her stitches.\n\n\"Shall I show you your room?\" said Belinda.\n\n\"Wait a moment, my dear,\" said Lady Aylmer. \"Frederic has gone to see\nif Sir Anthony is in his study.\"\n\nSir Anthony was found in his study, and now made his appearance.\n\n\"So this is Clara Amedroz,\" he said. \"My dear, you are welcome\nto Aylmer Park.\" This was so much better, that the kindness\nexpressed,--though there was nothing special in it,--brought a tear\ninto Clara's eye, and almost made her love Sir Anthony.\n\n\"By the by, Sir Anthony, have you seen Darvel? Darvel was wanting\nto see you especially about Nuggins. Nuggins says that he'll take\nthe bullocks now.\" This was said by Lady Aylmer, and was skilfully\narranged by her to put a stop to anything like enthusiasm on the part\nof Sir Anthony. Clara Amedroz had been invited to Aylmer Park, and\nwas to be entertained there, but it would not be expedient that she\nshould be made to think that anybody was particularly glad to see\nher, or that the family was at all proud of the proposed connection.\nWithin five minutes after this she was up in her room, and had\nreceived from Belinda tenders of assistance as to her lady's maid.\nBoth the mother and daughter had been anxious to learn whether Clara\nwould bring her own maid. Lady Aylmer, thinking that she would do so,\nhad already blamed her for extravagance. \"Of course Fred will have\nto pay for the journey and all the rest of it,\" she had said. But\nas soon as she had perceived that Clara had come without a servant,\nshe had perceived that any young woman who travelled in that way\nmust be unfit to be mated with her son. Clara, whose intelligence in\nsuch matters was sharp enough, assured Belinda that she wanted no\nassistance. \"I dare say you think it very odd,\" she said, \"but I\nreally can dress myself.\" And when the maid did come to unpack the\nthings, Clara would have sent her away at once had she been able. But\nthe maid, who was not a young woman, was obdurate. \"Oh no, miss; my\nlady wouldn't be pleased. If you please, miss, I'll do it.\" And so\nthe things were unpacked.\n\nClara was told that they dined at half-past seven, and she remained\nalone in her room till dinner-time, although it had not yet struck\nfive when she had gone up-stairs. The maid had brought her a cup of\ntea, and she seated herself at her fire, turning over in her mind the\ndifferent members of the household in which she found herself. It\nwould never do. She told herself over and over again that it would\nnever come to pass that that woman should be her mother-in-law, or\nthat that other woman should be her sister. It was manifest to her\nthat she was distasteful to them; and she had not lost a moment in\nassuring herself that they were distasteful to her. What purpose\ncould it answer that she should strive,--not to like them, for no\nsuch strife was possible,--but to appear to like them? The whole\nplace and everything about it was antipathetic to her. Would it not\nbe simply honest to Captain Aylmer that she should tell him so at\nonce, and go away? Then she remembered that Frederic had not spoken\nto her a single word since she had been under his father's roof. What\nsort of welcome would have been accorded to her had she chosen to go\ndown to Plaistow Hall?\n\nAt half-past seven she made her way by herself down-stairs. In this\nthere was some difficulty, as she remembered nothing of the rooms\nbelow, and she could not at first find a servant. But a man at last\ndid come to her in the hall, and by him she was shown into the\ndrawing-room. Here she was alone for a few minutes. As she looked\nabout her, she thought that no room she had ever seen had less of the\ncomfort of habitation. It was not here that she had met Lady Aylmer\nbefore dinner. There had, at any rate, been in that other room work\nthings, and the look of life which life gives to a room. But here\nthere was no life. The furniture was all in its place, and everything\nwas cold and grand and comfortless. They were making company of her\nat Aylmer Park! Clara was intelligent in such matters, and understood\nit all thoroughly.\n\nLady Aylmer was the first person to come to her. \"I hope my maid has\nbeen with you,\" said she;--to which Clara muttered something intended\nfor thanks. \"You'll find Richards a very clever woman, and quite a\nproper person.\"\n\n\"I don't at all doubt that.\"\n\n\"She has been here a good many years, and has perhaps little ways of\nher own,--but she means to be obliging.\"\n\n\"I shall give her very little trouble, Lady Aylmer. I am used to\ndress myself.\" I am afraid this was not exactly true as to Clara's\npast habits; but she could dress herself, and intended to do so in\nfuture, and in this way justified the assertion to herself.\n\n\"You had better let Richards come to you, my dear, while you are\nhere,\" said Lady Aylmer, with a slight smile on her countenance which\noutraged Clara more even than the words. \"We like to see young ladies\nnicely dressed here.\" To be told that she was to be nicely dressed\nbecause she was at Aylmer Park! Her whole heart was already up in\nrebellion. Do her best to please Lady Aylmer! It would be utterly\nimpossible to her to make any attempt whatever in that direction.\nThere was something in her ladyship's eye,--a certain mixture of\ncunning, and power, and hardness in the slight smile that would\ngather round her mouth, by which Clara was revolted. She already\nunderstood much of Lady Aylmer, but in one thing she was mistaken.\nShe thought that she saw simply the natural woman; but she did, in\ntruth, see the woman specially armed with an intention of being\ndisagreeable, made up to give offence, and prepared to create dislike\nand enmity. At the present moment nothing further was said, as\nCaptain Aylmer entered the room, and his mother immediately began to\ntalk to him in whispers.\n\nThe two first days of Clara's sojourn at Aylmer Park passed by\nwithout the occurrence of anything that was remarkable. That which\nmost surprised and annoyed her, as regarded her own position, was the\ncoldness of all the people around her, as connected with the actual\nfact of her engagement. Sir Anthony was very courteous to her, but\nhad never as yet once alluded to the fact that she was to become\none of his family as his daughter-in-law. Lady Aylmer called her\nMiss Amedroz,--using the name with a peculiar emphasis, as though\ndetermined to show that Miss Amedroz was to be Miss Amedroz as far\nas any one at Aylmer Park was concerned,--and treated her almost as\nthough her presence in the house was intrusive. Belinda was as cold\nas her mother in her mother's presence; but when alone with Clara\nwould thaw a little. She, in her difficulty, studiously avoided\ncalling the new-comer by any name at all. As to Captain Aylmer, it\nwas manifest to Clara that he was suffering almost more than she\nsuffered herself. His position was so painful that she absolutely\npitied him for the misery to which he was subjected by his own\nmother. They still called each other Frederic and Clara, and that\nwas the only sign of special friendship which manifested itself\nbetween them. And Clara, though she pitied him, could not but learn\nto despise him. She had hitherto given him credit at any rate for\na will of his own. She had believed him to be a man able to act in\naccordance with the dictates of his own conscience. But now she\nperceived him to be so subject to his mother that he did not dare\nto call his heart his own. What was to be the end of it all? And\nif there could only be one end, would it not be well that that\nend should be reached at once, so that she might escape from her\npurgatory?\n\nBut on the afternoon of the third day there seemed to have come a\nchange over Lady Aylmer. At lunch she was especially civil,--civil to\nthe extent of picking out herself for Clara, with her own fork, the\nbreast of a hashed fowl from a dish that was before her. This she did\nwith considerable care,--I may say, with a show of care; and then,\nthough she did not absolutely call Clara by her Christian name, she\ndid call her \"my dear.\" Clara saw it all, and felt that the usual\nplacidity of the afternoon would be broken by some special event. At\nthree o'clock, when the carriage as usual came to the door, Belinda\nwas out of the way, and Clara was made to understand that she and\nLady Aylmer were to be driven out without any other companion.\n\"Belinda is a little busy, my dear. So, if you don't mind, we'll go\nalone.\" Clara of course assented, and got into the carriage with a\nconviction that now she would hear her fate. She was rather inclined\nto think that Lady Aylmer was about to tell her that she had failed\nin obtaining the approbation of Aylmer Park, and that she must be\nreturned as goods of a description inferior to the order given. If\nsuch were the case, the breast of the chicken had no doubt been\nadministered as consolation. Clara had endeavoured, since she had\nbeen at Aylmer Park, to investigate her own feelings in reference\nto Captain Aylmer; but had failed, and knew that she had failed.\nShe wished to think that she loved him, as she could not endure the\nthought of having accepted a man whom she did not love. And she told\nherself that he had done nothing to forfeit her love. A woman who\nreally loves will hardly allow that her love should be forfeited by\nany fault. True love breeds forgiveness for all faults. And, after\nall, of what fault had Captain Aylmer been guilty? He had preached\nto her out of his mother's mouth. That had been all! She had first\naccepted him, and then rejected him, and then accepted him again;\nand now she would fain be firm, if firmness were only possible to\nher. Nevertheless, if she were told that she was to be returned as\ninferior, she would hold up her head under such disgrace as best she\nmight, and would not let the tidings break her heart.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Lady Aylmer, as soon as the trotting horses and\nrolling wheels made noise enough to prevent her words from reaching\nthe servants on the box, \"I want to say a few words to you;--and I\nthink that this will be a good opportunity.\"\n\n\"A very good opportunity,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Of course, my dear, you are aware that I have heard of something\ngoing on between you and my son Frederic.\" Now that Lady Aylmer had\ntaught herself to call Clara \"my dear,\" it seemed that she could\nhardly call her so often enough.\n\n\"Of course I know that Captain Aylmer has told you of our engagement.\nBut for that, I should not be here.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that might be,\" said Lady Aylmer; \"but at any rate,\nmy dear, he has told me that since the day of my sister's death there\nhas been--in point of fact, a sort of engagement.\"\n\n\"I don't think Captain Aylmer has spoken of it in that way.\"\n\n\"In what way? Of course he has not said a word that was not nice and\nlover-like, and all that sort of thing. I believe he would have done\nanything in the world that his aunt had told him; and as to his--\"\n\n\"Lady Aylmer!\" said Clara, feeling that her voice was almost\ntrembling with anger, \"I am sure you cannot intend to be unkind to\nme?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Or to insult me?\"\n\n\"Insult you, my dear! You should not use such strong words, my dear;\nindeed you should not. Nothing of the kind is near my thoughts.\"\n\n\"If you disapprove of my marrying your son, tell me so at once, and I\nshall know what to do.\"\n\n\"It depends, my dear;--it depends on circumstances, and that is just\nwhy I want to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Then tell me the circumstances,--though indeed I think it would have\nbeen better if they could have been told to me by Captain Aylmer\nhimself.\"\n\n\"There, my dear, you must allow me to judge. As a mother, of course\nI am anxious for my son. Now Frederic is a poor man. Considering the\nkind of society in which he has to live, and the position which he\nmust maintain as a Member of Parliament, he is a very poor man.\"\n\nThis was an argument which Clara certainly had not expected that\nany of the Aylmer family would condescend to use. She had always\nregarded Captain Aylmer as a rich man since he had inherited Mrs.\nWinterfield's property, knowing that previously to that he had been\nable to live in London as rich men usually do live. \"Is he?\" said\nshe. \"It may seem odd to you, Lady Aylmer, but I do not think that a\nword has ever passed between me and your son as to the amount of his\nincome.\"\n\n\"Not odd at all, my dear. Young ladies are always thoughtless about\nthose things, and when they are looking to be married think that\nmoney will come out of the skies.\"\n\n\"If you mean that I have been looking to be married--\"\n\n\"Well;--expecting. I suppose you have been expecting it.\" Then she\npaused; but as Clara said nothing, she went on. \"Of course, Frederic\nhas got my sister's moiety of the Perivale property;--about eight\nhundred a year, or something of that sort, when all deductions are\nmade. He will have the other moiety when I die, and if you and he can\nbe satisfied to wait for that event,--which may not perhaps be very\nlong--\" Then there was another pause, indicative of the melancholy\nnatural to such a suggestion, during which Clara looked at Lady\nAylmer, and made up her mind that her ladyship would live for the\nnext twenty-five years at least. \"If you can wait for that,\" she\ncontinued, \"it may be all very well, and though you will be poor\npeople, in Frederic's rank of life, you will be able to live.\"\n\n\"That will be so far fortunate,\" said Clara.\n\n\"But you'll have to wait,\" said Lady Aylmer, turning upon her\ncompanion almost fiercely. \"That is, you certainly will have to do so\nif you are to depend upon Frederic's income alone.\"\n\n\"I have nothing of my own,--as he knows; absolutely nothing.\"\n\n\"That does not seem to be quite so clear,\" said Lady Aylmer, speaking\nnow very cautiously,--or rather with a purpose of great caution; \"I\ndon't think that that is quite so clear. Frederic has been telling me\nthat there seems to be some sort of a doubt about the settlement of\nthe Belton estate.\"\n\n\"There is no sort of doubt whatsoever;--no shadow of a doubt. He is\nquite mistaken.\"\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry, my dear. It is not likely that you\nyourself should be a very good lawyer.\"\n\n\"Lady Aylmer, I must be in a hurry lest there should be any mistake\nabout this. There is no question here for lawyers. Frederic must have\nbeen misled by a word or two which I said to him with quite another\npurpose. Everybody concerned knows that the Belton estate goes to my\ncousin Will. My poor father was quite aware of it.\"\n\n\"That is all very well; and pray remember, my dear, that you need not\nattack me in this way. I am endeavouring, if possible, to arrange the\naccomplishment of your own wishes. It seems that Mr. Belton himself\ndoes not claim the property.\"\n\n\"There is no question of claiming. Because he is a man more generous\nthan any other person in the world,--romantically generous, he\nhas offered to give me the property which was my father's for his\nlifetime; but I do not suppose that you would wish, or that Captain\nAylmer would wish, that I should accept such an offer as that.\" There\nwas a tone in her voice as she said this, and a glance in her eye as\nshe turned her face full upon her companion, which almost prevailed\nagainst Lady Aylmer's force of character.\n\n\"I really don't know, my dear,\" said Lady Aylmer. \"You are so\nviolent.\"\n\n\"I certainly am eager about this. No consideration on earth would\ninduce me to take my cousin's property from him.\"\n\n\"It always seemed to me that that entail was a most unfair\nproceeding.\"\n\n\"What would it signify even if it were,--which it was not? Papa got\ncertain advantages on those conditions. But what can all that matter?\nIt belongs to Will Belton.\"\n\nThen there was another pause, and Clara thought that that subject\nwas over between them. But Lady Aylmer had not as yet completed her\npurpose. \"Shall I tell you, my dear, what I think you ought to do?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Lady Aylmer; if you wish it.\"\n\n\"I can at any rate tell you what it would become any young lady to\ndo under such circumstances. I suppose you will give me credit for\nknowing as much as that. Any young lady placed as you are would be\nrecommended by her friends,--if she had friends able and fit to give\nher advice,--to put the whole matter into the hands of her natural\nfriends and her lawyer together. Hear me out, my dear, if you please.\nAt least you can do that for me, as I am taking a great deal of\ntrouble on your behalf. You should let Frederic see Mr. Green. I\nunderstand that Mr. Green was your father's lawyer. And then Mr.\nGreen can see Mr. Belton. And so the matter can be arranged. It seems\nto me, from what I hear, that in this way, and in this way only,\nsomething can be done as to the proposed marriage. In no other way\ncan anything be done.\"\n\nThen Lady Aylmer had finished her argument, and throwing herself back\ninto the carriage, seemed to intimate that she desired no reply.\nShe had believed and did believe that her guest was so intent upon\nmarrying her son, that no struggle would be regarded as too great\nfor the achievement of that object. And such belief was natural on\nher part. Mothers always so think of girls engaged to their sons,\nand so think especially when the girls are penniless, and the sons\nare well to do in the world. But such belief, though it is natural,\nis sometimes wrong;--and it was altogether wrong in this instance.\n\"Then,\" said Clara, speaking very plainly, \"nothing can be done.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear.\"\n\nAfter that there was not a word said between them till the carriage\nwas once more within the park. Then Lady Aylmer spoke again. \"I\npresume you see, my dear, that under these circumstances any\nthought of marriage between you and my son must be quite out of the\nquestion,--at any rate for a great many years.\"\n\n\"I will speak to Captain Aylmer about it, Lady Aylmer.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear. So do. Of course he is his own master. But he is\nmy son as well, and I cannot see him sacrificed without an effort to\nsave him.\"\n\nWhen Clara came down to dinner on that day she was again Miss\nAmedroz, and she could perceive,--from Belinda's manner quite as\nplainly as from that of her ladyship,--that she was to have no more\ntit-bits of hashed chicken specially picked out for her by Lady\nAylmer's own fork. That evening and the two next days passed, just\nas had passed the two first days, and everything was dull, cold, and\nuncomfortable. Twice she had walked out with Frederic, and on each\noccasion had thought that he would refer to what his mother had said;\nbut he did not venture to touch upon the subject. Clara more than\nonce thought that she would do so herself; but when the moments came\nshe found that it was impossible. She could not bring herself to say\nanything that should have the appearance of a desire on her part to\nhurry on a marriage. She could not say to him, \"If you are too poor\nto be married,--or even if you mean to put forward that pretence,\nsay so at once.\" He still called her Clara, and still asked her to\nwalk with him, and still talked, when they were alone together, in\na distant cold way, of the events of their future combined life.\nWould they live at Perivale? Would it be necessary to refurnish the\nhouse? Should he keep any of the land on his own hands? These are\nall interesting subjects of discussion between an engaged man and\nthe girl to whom he is engaged; but the man, if he wish to make\nthem thoroughly pleasant to the lady, should throw something of the\nurgency of a determined and immediate purpose into the discussion.\nSomething should be said as to the actual destination of the rooms.\nA day should be fixed for choosing the furnishing. Or the gentleman\nshould declare that he will at once buy the cows for the farm. But\nwith Frederic Aylmer all discussions seemed to point to some cold,\ndistant future, to which Clara might look forward as she did to the\njoys of heaven. Will Belton would have bought the ring long since,\nand bespoken the priest, and arranged every detail of the honeymoon\ntour,--and very probably would have stood looking into a cradle shop\nwith longing eyes.\n\nAt last there came an absolute necessity for some plain speaking.\nCaptain Aylmer declared his intention of returning to London that he\nmight resume his parliamentary duties. He had purposed to remain till\nafter Easter, but it was found to be impossible. \"I find I must go\nup to-morrow,\" he said at breakfast. \"They are going to make a stand\nabout the Poor-rates, and I must be in the House in the evening.\"\nClara felt herself to be very cold and uncomfortable. As things were\nat present arranged she was to be left at Aylmer Park without a\nfriend. And how long was she to remain there? No definite ending had\nbeen proposed for her visit. Something must be said and something\nsettled before Captain Aylmer went away.\n\n\"You will come down for Easter, of course,\" said his mother.\n\n\"Yes; I shall come down for Easter, I think,--or at any rate at\nWhitsuntide.\"\n\n\"You must come at Easter, Frederic,\" said his mother.\n\n\"I don't doubt but I shall,\" said he.\n\n\"Miss Amedroz should lay her commands upon him,\" said Sir Anthony\ngallantly.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Lady Aylmer.\n\n\"I have commands to lay upon him all the same,\" said Clara; \"and if\nhe will give me half an hour this morning he shall have them.\" To\nthis Captain Aylmer, of course, assented,--as how could he escape\nfrom such assent,--and a regular appointment was made. Captain Aylmer\nand Miss Amedroz were to be closeted together in the little back\ndrawing-room immediately after breakfast. Clara would willingly have\navoided any such formality could she have done so compatibly with the\nexigencies of the occasion. She had been obliged to assert herself\nwhen Lady Aylmer had rebuked Sir Anthony, and then Lady Aylmer had\ndetermined that an air of business should be assumed. Clara, as\nshe was marched off into the back drawing-room, followed by her\nlover with more sheep-like gait even than her own, felt strongly\nthe absurdity and the wretchedness of her position. But she was\ndetermined to go through with her purpose.\n\n\"I am very sorry that I have to leave you so soon,\" said Captain\nAylmer as soon as the door was shut and they were alone together.\n\n\"Perhaps it may be better as it is, Frederic; as in this way we shall\nall come to understand each other, and something will be settled.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; perhaps that will be best.\"\n\n\"Your mother has told me that she disapproves of our marriage.\"\n\n\"No; not that, I think. I don't think she can have quite said that.\"\n\n\"She says that you cannot marry while she is alive,--that is, that\nyou cannot marry me because your income would not be sufficient.\"\n\n\"I certainly was speaking to her about my income.\"\n\n\"Of course I have got nothing.\" Here she paused. \"Not a penny-piece\nin the world that I can call my own.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you have.\"\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing!\"\n\n\"You have your aunt's legacy?\"\n\n\"No; I have not. She left me no legacy. But as that is between you\nand me, if we think of marrying each other, that would make no\ndifference.\"\n\n\"None at all, of course.\"\n\n\"But in truth I have got nothing. Your mother said something to me\nabout the Belton estate; as though there was some idea that possibly\nit might come to me.\"\n\n\"Your cousin himself seemed to think so.\"\n\n\"Frederic, do not let us deceive ourselves. There can be nothing of\nthe kind. I could not accept any portion of the property from my\ncousin,--even though our marriage were to depend upon it.\"\n\n\"Of course it does not.\"\n\n\"But if your means are not sufficient for your wants I am quite\nready to accept that reason as being sufficient for breaking our\nengagement.\"\n\n\"There need be nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"As for waiting for the death of another person,--for your mother's\ndeath, I should think it very wrong. Of course, if our engagement\nstands there need be no hurry; but--some time should be fixed.\" Clara\nas she said this felt that her face and forehead were suffused with a\nblush; but she was determined that it should be said, and the words\nwere pronounced.\n\n\"I quite think so too,\" said he.\n\n\"I am glad that we agree. Of course, I will leave it to you to fix\nthe time.\"\n\n\"You do not mean at this very moment?\" said Captain Aylmer, almost\naghast.\n\n\"No; I did not mean that.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what. I'll make a point of coming down at Easter. I\nwasn't sure about it before, but now I will be. And then it shall be\nsettled.\"\n\nSuch was the interview; and on the next morning Captain Aylmer\nstarted for London. Clara felt aware that she had not done or said\nall that should have been done and said; but, nevertheless, a step in\nthe right direction had been taken.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE AYLMER PARK HASHED CHICKEN COMES TO AN END.\n\n\nEaster in this year fell about the middle of April, and it still\nwanted three weeks of that time when Captain Aylmer started for\nLondon. Clara was quite alive to the fact that the next three weeks\nwould not be a happy time for her. She looked forward, indeed, to so\nmuch wretchedness during this period, that the days as they came were\nnot quite so bad as she had expected them to be. At first Lady Aylmer\nsaid little or nothing to her. It seemed to be agreed between them\nthat there was to be war, but that there was no necessity for any of\nthe actual operations of war during the absence of Captain Aylmer.\nClara had become Miss Amedroz again; and though an offer to be\ndriven out in the carriage was made to her every day, she was in\ngeneral able to escape the infliction;--so that at last it came to be\nunderstood that Miss Amedroz did not like carriage exercise. \"She has\nnever been used to it,\" said Lady Aylmer to her daughter. \"I suppose\nnot,\" said Belinda; \"but if she wasn't so very cross she'd enjoy it\njust for that reason.\" Clara sometimes walked about the grounds with\nBelinda, but on such occasions there was hardly anything that could\nbe called conversation between them, and Frederic Aylmer's name was\nnever mentioned.\n\nCaptain Aylmer had not been gone many days before she received a\nletter from her cousin, in which he spoke with absolute certainty of\nhis intention of giving up the estate. He had, he said, consulted\nMr. Green, and the thing was to be done. \"But it will be better,\nI think,\" he went on to say, \"that I should manage it for you till\nafter your marriage. I simply mean what I say. You are not to suppose\nthat I shall interfere in any way afterwards. Of course there will be\na settlement, as to which I hope you will allow me to see Mr. Green\non your behalf.\" In the first draught of his letter he had inserted a\nsentence in which he expressed a wish that the property should be so\nsettled that it might at last all come to some one bearing the name\nof Belton. But as he read this over, the condition,--for coming from\nhim it would be a condition,--seemed to him to be ungenerous, and he\nexpunged it. \"What does it matter who has it,\" he said to himself\nbitterly, \"or what he is called? I will never set my eyes upon his\nchildren, nor yet upon the place when he has become the master of\nit.\" Clara wrote both to her cousin and to the lawyer, repeating\nher assurance,--with great violence, as Lady Aylmer would have\nsaid,--that she would have nothing to do with the Belton estate. She\ntold Mr. Green that it would be useless for him to draw up any deeds.\n\"It can't be made mine unless I choose to have it,\" she said, \"and I\ndon't choose to have it.\" Then there came upon her a terrible fear.\nWhat if she should marry Captain Aylmer after all; and what if he,\nwhen he should be her husband, should take the property on her\nbehalf! Something must be done before her marriage to prevent the\npossibility of such results,--something as to the efficacy of which\nfor such prevention she could feel altogether certain.\n\nBut could she marry Captain Aylmer at all in her present mood? During\nthese three weeks she was unconsciously teaching herself to hope that\nshe might be relieved from her engagement. She did not love him. She\nwas becoming aware that she did not love him. She was beginning to\ndoubt whether, in truth, she had ever loved him. But yet she felt\nthat she could not escape from her engagement if he should show\nhimself to be really actuated by any fixed purpose to carry it out;\nnor could she bring herself to be so weak before Lady Aylmer as to\nseem to yield. The necessity of not striking her colours was forced\nupon her by the warfare to which she was subjected. She was unhappy,\nfeeling that her present position in life was bad, and unworthy of\nher. She could have brought herself almost to run away from Aylmer\nPark, as a boy runs away from school, were it not that she had no\nplace to which to run. She could not very well make her appearance\nat Plaistow Hall, and say that she had come there for shelter and\nsuccour. She could, indeed, go to Mrs. Askerton's cottage for awhile;\nand the more she thought of the state of her affairs, the more did\nshe feel sure that that would, before long, be her destiny. It must\nbe her destiny,--unless Captain Aylmer should return at Easter with\npurposes so firmly fixed that even his mother should not be able to\nprevail against them.\n\nAnd now, in these days, circumstances gave her a new friend,--or\nperhaps, rather, a new acquaintance, where she certainly had looked\nneither for the one or for the other. Lady Aylmer and Belinda and the\ncarriage and the horses used, as I have said, to go off without her.\nThis would take place soon after luncheon. Most of us know how the\nevents of the day drag themselves on tediously in such a country\nhouse as Aylmer Park,--a country house in which people neither read,\nnor flirt, nor gamble, nor smoke, nor have resort to the excitement\nof any special amusement. Lunch was on the table at half-past one,\nand the carriage was at the door at three. Eating and drinking\nand the putting on of bonnets occupied the hour and a half. From\nbreakfast to lunch Lady Aylmer, with her old \"front,\" would occupy\nherself with her household accounts. For some days after Clara's\narrival she put on her new \"front\" before lunch; but of late,--since\nthe long conversation in the carriage,--the new \"front\" did not\nappear till she came down for the carriage. According to the theory\nof her life, she was never to be seen by any but her own family\nin her old \"front.\" At breakfast she would appear with head so\nmysteriously enveloped,--with such a bewilderment of morning caps,\nthat old \"front\" or new \"front\" was all the same. When Sir Anthony\nperceived this change,--when he saw that Clara was treated as though\nshe belonged to Aylmer Park, then he told himself that his son's\nmarriage with Miss Amedroz was to be; and, as Miss Amedroz seemed\nto him to be a very pleasant young woman, he would creep out of his\nown quarters when the carriage was gone and have a little chat with\nher,--being careful to creep away again before her ladyship's return.\nThis was Clara's new friend.\n\n\"Have you heard from Fred since he has been gone?\" the old man asked\none day, when he had come upon Clara still seated in the parlour in\nwhich they had lunched. He had been out, at the front of the house,\nscolding the under-gardener; but the man had taken away his barrow\nand left him, and Sir Anthony had found himself without employment.\n\n\"Only a line to say that he is to be here on the sixteenth.\"\n\n\"I don't think people write so many love-letters as they did when I\nwas young,\" said Sir Anthony.\n\n\"To judge from the novels, I should think not. The old novels used to\nbe full of love-letters.\"\n\n\"Fred was never good at writing, I think.\"\n\n\"Members of Parliament have too much to do, I suppose,\" said Clara.\n\n\"But he always writes when there is any business. He's a capital man\nof business. I wish I could say as much for his brother,--or for\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Lady Aylmer seems to like work of that sort.\"\n\n\"So she does. She's fond of it,--I am not. I sometimes think that\nFred takes after her. Where was it you first knew him?\"\n\n\"At Perivale. We used, both of us, to be staying with Mrs.\nWinterfield.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; of course. The most natural thing in life. Well, my dear,\nI can assure you that I am quite satisfied.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sir Anthony. I'm glad to hear you say even as much as\nthat.\"\n\n\"Of course money is very desirable for a man situated like Fred; but\nhe'll have enough, and if he is pleased, I am. Personally, as regards\nyourself, I am more than pleased. I am indeed.\"\n\n\"It's very good of you to say so.\"\n\nSir Anthony looked at Clara, and his heart was softened towards her\nas he saw that there was a tear in her eye. A man's heart must be\nvery hard when it does not become softened by the trouble of a woman\nwith whom he finds himself alone. \"I don't know how you and Lady\nAylmer get on together,\" said he; \"but it will not be my fault if we\nare not friends.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that Lady Aylmer does not like me,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Indeed. I was afraid there was something of that. But you must\nremember she is hard to please. You'll find she'll come round in\ntime.\"\n\n\"She thinks that Captain Aylmer should not marry a woman without\nmoney.\"\n\n\"That's all very well; but I don't see why Fred shouldn't please\nhimself. He's old enough to know what he wants.\"\n\n\"Is he, Sir Anthony? That's just the question. I'm not quite sure\nthat he does know what he wants.\"\n\n\"Fred doesn't know, do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don't quite think he does, sir. And the worst of it is, I am in\ndoubt as well as he.\"\n\n\"In doubt about marrying him?\"\n\n\"In doubt whether it will be good for him or for any of us. I don't\nlike to come into a family that does not desire to have me.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't think so much of Lady Aylmer as all that, my dear.\"\n\n\"But I do think a great deal of her.\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to have you as a daughter-in-law. And as for\nLady Aylmer--between you and me, my dear, you shouldn't take every\nword she says so much to heart. She's the best woman in the world,\nand I'm sure I'm bound to say so. But she has her temper, you know;\nand I don't think you ought to give way to her altogether. There's\nthe carriage. It won't do you any good if we're found together\ntalking over it all; will it?\" Then the baronet hobbled off, and Lady\nAylmer, when she entered the room, found Clara sitting alone.\n\nWhether it was that the wife was clever enough to extract from her\nhusband something of the conversation that had passed between him\nand Clara, or whether she had some other source of information,--or\nwhether her conduct might proceed from other grounds, we need not\ninquire; but from that afternoon Lady Aylmer's manner and words to\nClara became much less courteous than they had been before. She would\nalways speak as though some great iniquity was being committed, and\nwent about the house with a portentous frown, as though some terrible\nmeasure must soon be taken with the object of putting an end to the\npresent extremely improper state of things. All this was so manifest\nto Clara, that she said to Sir Anthony one day that she could no\nlonger bear the look of Lady Aylmer's displeasure,--and that she\nwould be forced to leave Aylmer Park before Frederic's return, unless\nthe evil were mitigated. She had by this time told Sir Anthony that\nshe much doubted whether the marriage would be possible, and that she\nreally believed that it would be best for all parties that the idea\nshould be abandoned. Sir Anthony, when he heard this, could only\nshake his head and hobble away. The trouble was too deep for him to\ncure.\n\nBut Clara still held on; and now there wanted but two days to Captain\nAylmer's return, when, all suddenly, there arose a terrible storm at\nAylmer Park, and then came a direct and positive quarrel between Lady\nAylmer and Clara,--a quarrel direct and positive, and, on the part of\nboth ladies, very violent.\n\nNothing had hitherto been said at Aylmer Park about Mrs.\nAskerton,--nothing, that is, since Clara's arrival. And Clara had\nbeen thankful for this silence. The letter which Captain Aylmer had\nwritten to her about Mrs. Askerton will perhaps be remembered, and\nClara's answer to that letter. The Aylmer Park opinion as to this\npoor woman, and as to Clara's future conduct towards the poor woman,\nhad been expressed very strongly; and Clara had as strongly resolved\nthat she would not be guided by Aylmer Park opinions in that matter.\nShe had anticipated much that was disagreeable on this subject, and\nhad therefore congratulated herself not a little on the absence of\nall allusion to it. But Lady Aylmer had, in truth, kept Mrs. Askerton\nin reserve, as a battery to be used against Miss Amedroz if all other\nmodes of attack should fail,--as a weapon which would be powerful\nwhen other weapons had been powerless. For awhile she had thought\nit possible that Clara might be the owner of the Belton estate, and\nthen it had been worth the careful mother's while to be prepared to\naccept a daughter-in-law so dowered. We have seen how the question\nof such ownership had enabled her to put forward the plea of poverty\nwhich she had used on her son's behalf. But since that Frederic had\ndeclared his intention of marrying the young woman in spite of his\npoverty, and Clara seemed to be equally determined. \"He has been fool\nenough to speak the word, and she is determined to keep him to it,\"\nsaid Lady Aylmer to her daughter. Therefore the Askerton battery was\nbrought to bear,--not altogether unsuccessfully.\n\nThe three ladies were sitting together in the drawing-room, and had\nbeen as mute as fishes for half an hour. In these sittings they were\ngenerally very silent, speaking only in short little sentences. \"Will\nyou drive with us to-day, Miss Amedroz?\" \"Not to-day, I think, Lady\nAylmer.\" \"As you are reading, perhaps you won't mind our leaving\nyou?\" \"Pray do not put yourself to inconvenience for me, Miss\nAylmer.\" Such and such like was their conversation; but on a sudden,\nafter a full half-hour's positive silence, Lady Aylmer asked a\nquestion altogether of another kind. \"I think, Miss Amedroz, my son\nwrote to you about a certain Mrs. Askerton?\"\n\nClara put down her work and sat for a moment almost astonished.\nIt was not only that Lady Aylmer had asked so very disagreeable a\nquestion, but that she had asked it with so peculiar a voice,--a\nvoice as it were a command, in a manner that was evidently intended\nto be taken as serious, and with a look of authority in her eye, as\nthough she were resolved that this battery of hers should knock the\nenemy absolutely in the dust! Belinda gave a little spring in her\nchair, looked intently at her work, and went on stitching faster\nthan before. \"Yes he did,\" said Clara, finding that an answer was\nimperatively demanded from her.\n\n\"It was quite necessary that he should write. I believe it to be an\nundoubted fact that Mrs. Askerton is,--is,--is,--not at all what she\nought to be.\"\n\n\"Which of us is what we ought to be?\" said Clara.\n\n\"Miss Amedroz, on this subject I am not at all inclined to joke. Is\nit not true that Mrs. Askerton--\"\n\n\"You must excuse me, Lady Aylmer, but what I know of Mrs. Askerton,\nI know altogether in confidence; so that I cannot speak to you of her\npast life.\"\n\n\"But, Miss Amedroz, pray excuse me if I say that I must speak of\nit. When I remember the position in which you do us the honour of\nbeing our visitor here, how can I help speaking of it?\" Belinda\nwas stitching very hard, and would not even raise her eyes. Clara,\nwho still held her needle in her hand, resumed her work, and for a\nmoment or two made no further answer. But Lady Aylmer had by no means\ncompleted her task. \"Miss Amedroz,\" she said, \"you must allow me to\njudge for myself in this matter. The subject is one on which I feel\nmyself obliged to speak to you.\"\n\n\"But I have got nothing to say about it.\"\n\n\"You have, I believe, admitted the truth of the allegations made\nby us as to this woman.\" Clara was becoming very angry. A red spot\nshowed itself on each cheek, and a frown settled upon her brow. She\ndid not as yet know what she would say or how she would conduct\nherself. She was striving to consider how best she might assert her\nown independence. But she was fully determined that in this matter\nshe would not bend an inch to Lady Aylmer. \"I believe we may take\nthat as admitted?\" said her ladyship.\n\n\"I am not aware that I have admitted anything to you, Lady Aylmer, or\nsaid anything that can justify you in questioning me on the subject.\"\n\n\"Justify me in questioning a young woman who tells me that she is to\nbe my future daughter-in-law!\"\n\n\"I have not told you so. I have never told you anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Then on what footing, Miss Amedroz, do you do us the honour of being\nwith us here at Aylmer Park?\"\n\n\"On a very foolish footing.\"\n\n\"On a foolish footing! What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means that I have been foolish in coming to a house in which I am\nsubjected to such questioning.\"\n\n\"Belinda, did you ever hear anything like this? Miss Amedroz, I must\npersevere, however much you may dislike it. The story of this woman's\nlife,--whether she be Mrs. Askerton or not, I don't know--\"\n\n\"She is Mrs. Askerton,\" said Clara.\n\n\"As to that I do not profess to know, and I dare say that you are\nno wiser than myself. But what she has been we do know.\" Here Lady\nAylmer raised her voice and continued to speak with all the eloquence\nwhich assumed indignation could give her. \"What she has been we do\nknow, and I ask you, as a duty which I owe to my son, whether you\nhave put an end to your acquaintance with so very disreputable a\nperson,--a person whom even to have known is a disgrace?\"\n\n\"I know her, and--\"\n\n\"Stop one minute, if you please. My questions are these--Have you put\nan end to that acquaintance? And are you ready to give a promise that\nit shall never be resumed?\"\n\n\"I have not put an end to that acquaintance,--or rather that\naffectionate friendship as I should call it, and I am ready to\npromise that it shall be maintained with all my heart.\"\n\n\"Belinda, do you hear her?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\" And Belinda slowly shook her head, which was now bowed\nlower than ever over her lap.\n\n\"And that is your resolution?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Aylmer; that is my resolution.\"\n\n\"And you think that becoming to you, as a young woman?\"\n\n\"Just so; I think that becoming to me,--as a young woman.\"\n\n\"Then let me tell you, Miss Amedroz, that I differ from you\naltogether,--altogether.\" Lady Aylmer, as she repeated the last word,\nraised her folded hands as though she were calling upon heaven to\nwitness how thoroughly she differed from the young woman!\n\n\"I don't see how I am to help that, Lady Aylmer. I dare say we may\ndiffer on many subjects.\"\n\n\"I dare say we do. I dare say we do. And I need not point out to you\nhow very little that would be a matter of regret to me, but for the\nhold you have upon my unfortunate son.\"\n\n\"Hold upon him, Lady Aylmer! How dare you insult me by such\nlanguage?\" Hereupon Belinda again jumped in her chair; but Lady\nAylmer looked as though she enjoyed the storm.\n\n\"You undoubtedly have a hold upon him, Miss Amedroz, and I think that\nit is a great misfortune. Of course, when he hears what your conduct\nis with reference to this--person, he will release himself from his\nentanglement.\"\n\n\"He can release himself from his entanglement whenever he chooses,\"\nsaid Clara, rising from her chair. \"Indeed, he is released. I shall\nlet Captain Aylmer know that our engagement must be at an end, unless\nhe will promise that I shall never in future be subjected to the\nunwarrantable insolence of his mother.\" Then she walked off to the\ndoor, not regarding, and indeed not hearing, the parting shot that\nwas fired at her.\n\nAnd now what was to be done! Clara went up to her own room, making\nherself strong and even comfortable, with an inward assurance that\nnothing should ever induce her even to sit down to table again with\nLady Aylmer. She would not willingly enter the same room with Lady\nAylmer, or have any speech with her. But what should she at once do?\nShe could not very well leave Aylmer Park without settling whither\nshe would go; nor could she in any way manage to leave the house\non that afternoon. She almost resolved that she would go to Mrs.\nAskerton. Everything was of course over between her and Captain\nAylmer, and therefore there was no longer any hindrance to her doing\nso on that score. But what would be her cousin Will's wish? He, now,\nwas the only friend to whom she could trust for good council. What\nwould be his advice? Should she write and ask him? No;--she could not\ndo that. She could not bring herself to write to him, telling him\nthat the Aylmer \"entanglement\" was at an end. Were she to do so, he,\nwith his temperament, would take such letter as meaning much more\nthan it was intended to mean. But she would write a letter to Captain\nAylmer. This she thought that she would do at once, and she began it.\nShe got as far as \"My dear Captain Aylmer,\" and then she found that\nthe letter was one which could not be written very easily. And she\nremembered, as the greatness of the difficulty of writing the letter\nbecame plain to her, that it could not now be sent so as to reach\nCaptain Aylmer before he would leave London. If written at all,\nit must be addressed to him at Aylmer Park, and the task might be\ndone to-morrow as well as to-day. So that task was given up for the\npresent.\n\nBut she did write a letter to Mrs. Askerton,--a letter which she\nwould send or not on the morrow, according to the state of her mind\nas it might then be. In this she declared her purpose of leaving\nAylmer Park on the day after Captain Aylmer's arrival, and asked\nto be taken in at the cottage. An answer was to be sent to her,\naddressed to the Great Northern Railway Hotel.\n\nRichards, the maid, came up to her before dinner, with offers of\nassistance for dressing,--offers made in a tone which left no doubt\non Clara's mind that Richards knew all about the quarrel. But Clara\ndeclined to be dressed, and sent down a message saying that she would\nremain in her room, and begging to be supplied with tea. She would\nnot even condescend to say that she was troubled with a headache.\nThen Belinda came up to her, just before dinner was announced, and\nwith a fluttered gravity advised Miss Amedroz to come down-stairs.\n\"Mamma thinks it will be much better that you should show yourself,\nlet the final result be what it may.\"\n\n\"But I have not the slightest desire to show myself.\"\n\n\"There are the servants, you know.\"\n\n\"But, Miss Aylmer, I don't care a straw for the servants;--really not\na straw.\"\n\n\"And papa will feel it so.\"\n\n\"I shall be sorry if Sir Anthony is annoyed;--but I cannot help it.\nIt has not been my doing.\"\n\n\"And mamma says that my brother would of course wish it.\"\n\n\"After what your mother has done, I don't see what his wishes would\nhave to do with it,--even if she knew them,--which I don't think she\ndoes.\"\n\n\"But if you will think of it, I'm sure you'll find it is the proper\nthing to do. There is nothing to be avoided so much as an open\nquarrel, that all the servants can see.\"\n\n\"I must say, Miss Aylmer, that I disregard the servants. After what\npassed down-stairs, of course I have had to consider what I should\ndo. Will you tell your mother that I will stay here, if she will\npermit it?\"\n\n\"Of course. She will be delighted.\"\n\n\"I will remain, if she will permit it, till the morning after Captain\nAylmer's arrival. Then I shall go.\"\n\n\"Where to, Miss Amedroz?\"\n\n\"I have already written to a friend, asking her to receive me.\"\n\nMiss Aylmer paused a moment before she asked her next question;--but\nshe did ask it, showing by her tone and manner that she had been\ndriven to summon up all her courage to enable her to do so. \"To what\nfriend, Miss Amedroz? Mamma will be glad to know.\"\n\n\"That is a question which Lady Aylmer can have no right to ask,\" said\nClara.\n\n\"Oh;--very well. Of course, if you don't like to tell, there's no\nmore to be said.\"\n\n\"I do not like to tell, Miss Aylmer.\"\n\nClara had her tea in her room that evening, and lived there the\nwhole of the next day. The family down-stairs was not comfortable.\nSir Anthony could not be made to understand why his guest kept her\nroom,--which was not odd, as Lady Aylmer was very sparing in the\ninformation she gave him; and Belinda found it to be impossible to\nsit at table, or to say a few words to her father and mother, without\nshowing at every moment her consciousness that a crisis had occurred.\nBy the next day's post the letter to Mrs. Askerton was sent, and\nat the appointed time Captain Aylmer arrived. About an hour after\nhe entered the house, Belinda went up-stairs with a message from\nhim;--would Miss Amedroz see him? Miss Amedroz would see him, but\nmade it a condition of doing so that she should not be required to\nmeet Lady Aylmer. \"She need not be afraid,\" said Lady Aylmer. \"Unless\nshe sends me a full apology, with a promise that she will have no\nfurther intercourse whatever with that woman, I will never willingly\nsee her again.\" A meeting was therefore arranged between Captain\nAylmer and Miss Amedroz in a sitting-room up-stairs.\n\n\"What is all this, Clara?\" said Captain Aylmer, at once.\n\n\"Simply this,--that your mother has insulted me most wantonly.\"\n\n\"She says that it is you who have been uncourteous to her.\"\n\n\"Be it so;--you can of course believe whichever you please, and it is\ndesirable, no doubt, that you should prefer to believe your mother.\"\n\n\"But I do not wish there to be any quarrel.\"\n\n\"But there is a quarrel, Captain Aylmer, and I must leave your\nfather's house. I cannot stay here after what has taken place. Your\nmother told me;--I cannot tell you what she told me, but she made\nagainst me just those accusations which she knew it would be the\nhardest for me to bear.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you have mistaken her.\"\n\n\"No; I have not mistaken her.\"\n\n\"And where do you propose to go?\"\n\n\"To Mrs. Askerton.\"\n\n\"Oh, Clara!\"\n\n\"I have written to Mrs. Askerton to ask her to receive me for awhile.\nIndeed, I may almost say that I had no other choice.\"\n\n\"If you go there, Clara, there will be an end to everything.\"\n\n\"And there must be an end of what you call everything, Captain\nAylmer,\" said she, smiling. \"It cannot be for your good to bring into\nyour family a wife of whom your mother would think so badly as she\nthinks of me.\"\n\nThere was a great deal said, and Captain Aylmer walked very often up\nand down the room, endeavouring to make some arrangement which might\nseem in some sort to appease his mother. Would Clara only allow a\ntelegram to be sent to Mrs. Askerton, to explain that she had changed\nher mind? But Clara would allow no such telegram to be sent, and on\nthat evening she packed up all her things. Captain Aylmer saw her\nagain and again, sending Belinda backwards and forwards, and making\ndifferent appointments up to midnight; but it was all to no purpose,\nand on the next morning she took her departure alone in the Aylmer\nPark carriage for the railway station. Captain Aylmer had proposed to\ngo with her; but she had so stoutly declined his company that he was\nobliged to abandon his intention. She saw neither of the ladies on\nthat morning, but Sir Anthony came out to say a word of farewell to\nher in the hall. \"I am very sorry for all this,\" said he. \"It is a\npity,\" said Clara, \"but it cannot be helped. Good-bye, Sir Anthony.\"\n\"I hope we may meet again under pleasanter circumstances,\" said the\nbaronet. To this Clara made no reply, and was then handed into the\ncarriage by Captain Aylmer.\n\n\"I am so bewildered,\" said he, \"that I cannot now say anything\ndefinite, but I shall write to you, and probably follow you.\"\n\n\"Do not follow me, pray, Captain Aylmer,\" said she. Then she was\ndriven to the station; and as she passed through the lodges of the\npark entrance she took what she intended to be a final farewell of\nAylmer Park.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nONCE MORE BACK TO BELTON.\n\n\nWhen the carriage was driven away, Sir Anthony and Captain Aylmer\nwere left standing alone at the hall door of the house. The servants\nhad slunk off, and the father and son, looking at each other, felt\nthat they also must slink away, or else have some words together on\nthe subject of their guest's departure. The younger gentleman would\nhave preferred that there should be no words, but Sir Anthony was\ncurious to know something of what had passed in the house during the\nlast few days. \"I'm afraid things are not going quite comfortable,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"It seems to me, sir,\" said his son, \"that things very seldom do go\nquite comfortable.\"\n\n\"But, Fred,--what is it all about? Your mother says that Miss Amedroz\nis behaving very badly.\"\n\n\"And Miss Amedroz says that my mother is behaving very badly.\"\n\n\"Of course;--that's only natural. And what do you say?\"\n\n\"I say nothing, sir. The less said the soonest mended.\"\n\n\"That's all very well; but it seems to me that you, in your position,\nmust say something. The long and the short of it is this. Is she to\nbe your wife?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, sir, I don't know.\"\n\nThey were still standing out under the portico, and as Sir Anthony\ndid not for a minute or two ask any further questions, Captain Aylmer\nturned as though he were going into the house. But his father had\nstill a word or two to say. \"Stop a moment, Fred. I don't often\ntrouble you with advice.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm always glad to hear it when you offer any.\"\n\n\"I know very well that in most things your opinion is better than\nmine. You've had advantages which I never had. But I've had more\nexperience than you, my dear boy. It stands to reason that in some\nthings I must have had more experience than you.\" There was a tone of\nmelancholy in the father's voice as he said this which quite touched\nhis son, and which brought the two closer together out in the porch.\n\"Take my word for it,\" continued Sir Anthony, \"that you are much\nbetter off as you are than you could be with a wife.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that no man should marry?\"\n\n\"No;--I don't mean to say that. An eldest son ought to marry, so that\nthe property may have an heir. And poor men should marry, I suppose,\nas they want wives to do for them. And sometimes, no doubt, a man\nmust marry--when he has got to be very fond of a girl, and has\ncompromised himself, and all that kind of thing. I would never advise\nany man to sully his honour.\" As Sir Anthony said this he raised\nhimself a little with his two sticks and spoke out in a bolder voice.\nThe voice however, sank again as he descended from the realms of\nhonour to those of prudence. \"But none of these cases are yours,\nFred. To be sure you'll have the Perivale property; but that is\nnot a family estate, and you'll be much better off by turning it\ninto money. And in the way of comfort, you can be a great deal more\ncomfortable without a wife than you can with one. What do you want a\nwife for? And then, as to Miss Amedroz,--for myself I must say that I\nlike her uncommonly. She has been very pleasant in her ways with me.\nBut,--somehow or another, I don't think you are so much in love with\nher but what you can do without her.\" Hereupon he paused and looked\nhis son full in the face. Fred had also been thinking of the matter\nin his own way, and asking himself the same question,--whether he was\nin truth so much in love with Clara that he could not live without\nher. \"Of course I don't know,\" continued Sir Anthony, \"what has taken\nplace just now between you and her, or what between her and your\nmother; but I suppose the whole thing might fall through without\nany further trouble to you,--or without anything unhandsome on your\npart?\" But Captain Aylmer still said nothing. The whole thing might,\nno doubt, fall through, but he wished to be neither unjust nor\nungenerous,--and he specially wished to avoid anything unhandsome.\nAfter a further pause of a few minutes, Sir Anthony went on again,\npouring forth the words of experience. \"Of course marriage is all\nvery well. I married rather early in life, and have always found your\nmother to be a most excellent woman. A better woman doesn't breathe.\nI'm as sure of that as I am of anything. But God bless me,--of course\nyou can see. I can't call anything my own. I'm tied down here and I\ncan't move. I've never got a shilling to spend, while all these lazy\nhounds about the place are eating me up. There isn't a clerk with a\nhundred a year in London that isn't better off than I am as regards\nready money. And what comfort have I in a big house, and no end\nof gardens, and a place like this? What pleasures do I get out of\nit? That comes of marrying and keeping up one's name in the county\nrespectably! What do I care for the county? D---- the county! I often\nwish that I'd been a younger son,--as you are.\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer had no answer to make to all this. It was, no doubt,\nthe fact that age and good living had made Sir Anthony altogether\nincapable of enjoying the kind of life which he desiderated, and that\nhe would probably have eaten and drunk himself into his grave long\nsince had that kind of life been within his reach. This, however,\nthe son could not explain to the father. But in fitting, as he\nendeavoured to do, his father's words to his own case, Captain\nAylmer did perceive that a bachelor's life might perhaps be the\nmost suitable to his own peculiar case. Only he would do nothing\nunhandsome. As to that he was quite resolved. Of course Clara must\nshow herself to be in some degree amenable to reason and to the\nordinary rules of the world; but he was aware that his mother was\nhot-tempered, and he generously made up his mind that he would give\nMiss Amedroz even yet another chance.\n\nAt the hotel in London Clara found a short note from Mrs. Askerton,\nin which she was warmly assured that everything should be done to\nmake her comfortable at the cottage as long as she should wish to\nstay there. But the very warmth of affection thus expressed made\nher almost shrink from what she was about to do. Mrs. Askerton was\nno doubt anxious for her coming; but would her cousin Will Belton\napprove of the visit; and what would her cousin Mary say about it?\nIf she was being driven into this step against her own approval, by\nthe insolence of Lady Aylmer,--if she was doing this thing simply\nbecause Lady Aylmer had desired her not to do it, and was doing it in\nopposition to the wishes of the man she had promised to marry as well\nas to her own judgment, there could not but be cause for shrinking.\nAnd yet she believed that she was right. If she could only have had\nsome one to tell her,--some one in whom she could trust implicitly to\ndirect her! She had hitherto been very much prone to rebel against\nauthority. Against her aunt she had rebelled, and against her father,\nand against her lover. But now she wished with all her heart that\nthere might be some one to whom she could submit with perfect faith.\nIf she could only know what her cousin Will would think. In him she\nthought she could have trusted with that perfect faith;--if only he\nwould have been a brother to her.\n\nBut it was too late now for doubting, and on the next day she found\nherself getting out of the old Redicote fly, at Colonel Askerton's\ndoor. He came out to meet her, and his greeting was very friendly.\nHitherto there had been no great intimacy between him and her, owing\nrather to the manner of life adopted by him than to any cause of\nmutual dislike between them. Mrs. Askerton had shown herself desirous\nof some social intercourse since she had been at Belton, but with\nColonel Askerton there had been nothing of this. He had come there\nintending to live alone, and had been satisfied to carry out his\npurpose. But now Clara had come to his house as a guest, and he\nassumed towards her altogether a new manner. \"We are so glad to have\nyou,\" he said, taking both her hands. Then she passed on into the\ncottage, and in a minute was in her friend's arms.\n\n\"Dear Clara;--dearest Clara, I am so glad to have you here.\"\n\n\"It is very good of you.\"\n\n\"No, dear; the goodness is with you to come. But we won't quarrel\nabout that. We will both be ever so good. And he is so happy that\nyou should be here. You'll get to know him now. But come up-stairs.\nThere's a fire in your room, and I'll be your maid for the\noccasion,--because then we can talk.\" Clara did as she was bid and\nwent up-stairs; and as she sat over the fire while her friend knelt\nbeside her,--for Mrs. Askerton was given to such kneelings,--she\ncould not but tell herself that Belton Cottage was much more\ncomfortable than Aylmer Park. During the whole time of her sojourn\nat Aylmer Park no word of real friendship had once greeted her\nears. Everything there had been cold and formal, till coldness and\nformality had given way to violent insolence.\n\n\"And so you have quarrelled with her ladyship,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\"I knew you would.\"\n\n\"I have not said anything about quarrelling with her.\"\n\n\"But of course you have. Come, now; don't make yourself disagreeable.\nYou have had a downright battle;--have you not?\"\n\n\"Something very like it, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"I am so glad,\" said Mrs. Askerton, rubbing her hands.\n\n\"That is ill-natured.\"\n\n\"Very well. Let it be ill-natured. One isn't to be good-natured all\nround, or what would be the use of it? And what sort of woman is\nshe?\"\n\n\"Oh dear; I couldn't describe her. She is very large, and wears a\ngreat wig, and manages everything herself, and I've no doubt she's a\nvery good woman in her own way.\"\n\n\"I can see her at once;--and a very pillar of virtue as regards\nmorality and going to church. Poor me! Does she know that you have\ncome here?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt she does. I did not tell her, nor would I tell her\ndaughter; but I told Captain Aylmer.\"\n\n\"That was right. That was very right. I'm so glad of that. But who\nwould doubt that you would show a proper spirit? And what did he\nsay?\"\n\n\"Not much, indeed.\"\n\n\"I won't trouble you about him. I don't in the least doubt but all\nthat will come right. And what sort of man is Sir Anthony?\"\n\n\"A common-place sort of a man; very gouty, and with none of his\nwife's strength. I liked him the best of them all.\"\n\n\"Because you saw the least of him, I suppose.\"\n\n\"He was kind in his manner to me.\"\n\n\"And they were like she-dragons. I understand it all, and can see\nthem just as though I had been there. I felt that I knew what would\ncome of it when you first told me that you were going to Aylmer Park.\nI did, indeed. I could have prophesied it all.\"\n\n\"What a pity you did not.\"\n\n\"It would have done no good;--and your going there has done good. It\nhas opened your eyes to more than one thing, I don't doubt. But tell\nme,--have you told them in Norfolk that you were coming here?\"\n\n\"No;--I have not written to my cousin.\"\n\n\"Don't be angry with me if I tell you something. I have.\"\n\n\"Have what?\"\n\n\"I have told Mr. Belton that you were coming here. It was in this\nway. I had to write to him about our continuing in the cottage.\nColonel Askerton always makes me write if it's possible, and of\ncourse we were obliged to settle something as to the place.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry you said anything about me.\"\n\n\"How could I help it? What would you have thought of me, or what\nwould he have thought, if, when writing to him, I had not mentioned\nsuch a thing as your visit? Besides, it's much better that he should\nknow.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that you said anything about it.\"\n\n\"You are ashamed that he should know that you are here,\" said Mrs.\nAskerton, in a tone of reproach.\n\n\"Ashamed! No; I am not ashamed. But I would sooner that he had not\nbeen told,--as yet. Of course he would have been told before long.\"\n\n\"But you are not angry with me?\"\n\n\"Angry! How can I be angry with any one who is so kind to me?\"\n\nThat evening passed by very pleasantly, and when she went again to\nher own room, Clara was almost surprised to find how completely she\nwas at home. On the next day she and Mrs. Askerton together went up\nto the house, and roamed through all the rooms, and Clara seated\nherself in all the accustomed chairs. On the sofa, just in the spot\nto which Belton had thrown it, she found the key of the cellar.\nShe took it up in her hand, thinking that she would give it to the\nservant; but again she put it back upon the sofa. It was his key, and\nhe had left it there, and if ever there came an occasion she would\nremind him where he had put it. Then they went out to the cow, who\nwas at her ease in a little home paddock.\n\n\"Dear Bessy,\" said Clara. \"See how well she knows me.\" But I think\nthe tame little beast would have known any one else as well who\nhad gone up to her as Clara did, with food in her hand. \"She is\nquite as sacred as any cow that ever was worshipped among the\ncow-worshippers,\" said Mrs. Askerton. \"I suppose they milk her and\nsell the butter, but otherwise she is not regarded as an ordinary cow\nat all.\" \"Poor Bessy,\" said Clara. \"I wish she had never come here.\nWhat is to be done with her?\" \"Done with her! She'll stay here till\nshe dies a natural death, and then a romantic pair of mourners will\nfollow her to her grave, mixing their sympathetic tears comfortably\nas they talk of the old days; and in future years, Bessy will grow to\nbe a divinity of the past, never to be mentioned without tenderest\nreminiscences. I have not the slightest difficulty in prophesying as\nto Bessy's future life and posthumous honours.\" They roamed about\nthe place the whole morning, through the garden and round the farm\nbuildings, and in and out of the house; and at every turn something\nwas said about Will Belton. But Clara would not go up to the rocks,\nalthough Mrs. Askerton more than once attempted to turn in that\ndirection. He had said that he never would go there again except\nunder certain circumstances. She knew that those circumstances would\nnever come to pass; but yet neither would she go there. She would\nnever go there till her cousin was married. Then, if in those days\nshe should ever be present at Belton Castle, she would creep up to\nthe spot all alone, and allow herself to think of the old days.\n\nOn the following morning there came to her a letter bearing the\nDownham post-mark,--but at the first glance she knew that it was not\nfrom her cousin Will. Will wrote with a bold round hand, that was\nextremely plain and caligraphic when he allowed himself time for the\nwork in hand, as he did with the commencement of his epistles, but\nwhich would become confused and altogether anti-caligraphic when he\nfell into a hurry towards the end of his performance,--as was his\nwont. But the address of this letter was written in a pretty, small,\nfemale hand,--very careful in the perfection of every letter, and\nvery neat in every stroke. It was from Mary Belton, between whom and\nClara there had never hitherto been occasion for correspondence. The\nletter was as follows:--\n\n\n   Plaistow Hall, April, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR COUSIN CLARA,\n\n   William has heard from your friends at Belton, who are\n   tenants on the estate, and as to whom there seems to be\n   some question whether they are to remain. He has written,\n   saying, I believe, that there need be no difficulty if\n   they wish to stay there. But we learn, also, from Mrs.\n   Askerton's letter, that you are expected at the cottage,\n   and therefore I will address this to Belton, supposing\n   that it may find you there.\n\n   You and I have never yet known each other;--which has\n   been a grief to me; but this grief, I hope, may be cured\n   some day before long. I myself, as you know, am such a\n   poor creature that I cannot go about the world to see my\n   friends as other people do;--at least, not very well; and\n   therefore I write to you with the object of asking you to\n   come and see me here. This is an interesting old house in\n   its way; and though I must not conceal from you that life\n   here is very, very quiet, I would do my best to make the\n   days pass pleasantly with you. I had heard that you were\n   gone to Aylmer Park. Indeed, William told me of his taking\n   you up to London. Now it seems you have left Yorkshire,\n   and I suppose you will not return there very soon. If it\n   be so, will it not be well that you should come to me for\n   a short time?\n\n   Both William and I feel that just for the present,--for\n   a little time,--you would perhaps prefer to be alone\n   with me. He must go to London for awhile, and then on to\n   Belton, to settle your affairs and his. He intends to be\n   absent for six weeks. If you would not be afraid of the\n   dullness of this house for so long a time, pray come to\n   us. The pleasure to me would be very great, and I hope\n   that you have some of that feeling, which with me is so\n   strong, that we ought not to be any longer personally\n   strangers to each other. You could then make up your mind\n   as to what you would choose to do afterwards. I think\n   that by the end of that time,--that is, when William\n   returns,--my uncle and aunt from Sleaford will be with\n   us. He is a clergyman, you know; and if you then like to\n   remain, they will be delighted to make your acquaintance.\n\n   It seems to be a long journey for a young lady to make\n   alone, from Belton to Plaistow; but travelling is so easy\n   now-a-days, and young ladies seem to be so independent,\n   that you may be able to manage it. Hoping to see you soon,\n   I remain\n\n   Your affectionate Cousin,\n\n   MARY BELTON.\n\n\nThis letter she received before breakfast, and was therefore able to\nread it in solitude, and to keep its receipt from the knowledge of\nMrs. Askerton, if she should be so minded. She understood at once all\nthat it intended to convey,--a hint that Plaistow Hall would be a\nbetter resting place for her than Mrs. Askerton's cottage; and an\nassurance that if she would go to Plaistow Hall for her convenience,\nno advantage should be taken of her presence there by the owner of\nthe house for his convenience. As she sat thinking of the offer which\nhad been made to her she fancied that she could see and hear her\ncousin Will as he discussed the matter with his sister, and with a\nhalf assumption of surliness declared his own intention of going\naway. Captain Aylmer after that interview in London had spoken of\nBelton's conduct as being unpardonable; but Clara had not only\npardoned him, but had, in her own mind, pronounced his virtues to be\nso much greater than his vices as to make him almost perfect. \"But\nI will not drive him out of his own house,\" she said. \"What does it\nmatter where I go?\"\n\n\"Colonel Askerton has had a letter from your cousin,\" said Mrs.\nAskerton as soon as the two ladies were alone together.\n\n\"And what does he say?\"\n\n\"Not a word about you.\"\n\n\"So much the better. I have given him trouble enough, and am glad to\nthink that he should be free of me for awhile. Is Colonel Askerton to\nstay at the cottage?\"\n\n\"Now, Clara, you are a hypocrite. You know that you are a hypocrite.\"\n\n\"Very likely,--but I don't know why you should accuse me just now.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. Have not you heard from Norfolk also?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I have.\"\n\n\"I was sure of it. I knew he would never have written in that way, in\nanswer to my letter, ignoring your visit here altogether, unless he\nhad written to you also.\"\n\n\"But he has not written to me. My letter is from his sister. There\nit is.\" Whereupon she handed the letter to Mrs. Askerton, and waited\npatiently while it was being read. Her friend returned it to her\nwithout a word, and Clara was the first to speak again. \"It is a nice\nletter, is it not? I never saw her you know.\"\n\n\"So she says.\"\n\n\"But is it not a kind letter?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is meant for kindness. It is not very complimentary\nto me. It presumes that such a one as I may be treated without the\nslightest consideration. And so I may. It is only fit that I should\nbe so treated. If you ask my advice, I advise you to go at once;--at\nonce.\"\n\n\"But I have not asked your advice, dear; nor do I intend to ask it.\"\n\n\"You would not have shown it me if you had not intended to go.\"\n\n\"How unreasonable you are! You told me just now that I was a\nhypocrite for not telling you of my letter, and now you are angry\nwith me because I have shown it you.\"\n\n\"I am not angry. I think you have been quite right to show it me. I\ndon't know how else you could have acted upon it.\"\n\n\"But I do not mean to act upon it. I shall not go to Plaistow. There\nare two reasons against it, each sufficient. I shall not leave you\njust yet,--unless you send me away; and I shall not cause my cousin\nto be turned out of his own house.\"\n\n\"Why should he be turned out? Why should you not go to him? You love\nhim;--and as for him, he is more in love than any man I ever knew. Go\nto Plaistow Hall, and everything will run smooth.\"\n\n\"No, dear; I shall not do that.\"\n\n\"Then you are foolish. I am bound to tell you so, as I have inveigled\nyou here.\"\n\n\"I thought I had invited myself.\"\n\n\"No; I asked you to come, and when I asked you I knew that I was\nwrong. Though I meant to be kind, I knew that I was unkind. I saw\nthat my husband disapproved it, though he had not the heart to tell\nme so. I wish he had. I wish he had.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton, I cannot tell you how much you wrong yourself, and\nhow you wrong me also. I am more than contented to be here.\"\n\n\"But you should not be contented to be here. It is just that. In\nlearning to love me,--or rather, perhaps, to pity me, you lower\nyourself. Do you think that I do not see it all, and know it all? Of\ncourse it is bad to be alone, but I have no right not to be alone.\"\nThere was nothing for Clara to do but to draw herself once again\nclose to the poor woman, and to embrace her with protestations of\nfair, honest, equal regard and friendship. \"Do you think I do not\nunderstand that letter?\" continued Mrs. Askerton. \"If it had come\nfrom Lady Aylmer I could have laughed at it, because I believe Lady\nAylmer to be an overbearing virago, whom it is good to put down\nin every way possible. But this comes from a pure-minded woman,\none whom I believe to be little given to harsh judgments on her\nfellow-sinners; and she tells you, in her calm wise way, that it is\nbad for you to be here with me.\"\n\n\"She says nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"But does she not mean it? Tell me honestly;--do you not know that\nshe means it?\"\n\n\"I am not to be guided by what she means.\"\n\n\"But you are to be guided by what her brother means. It is to come\nto that, and you may as well bend your neck at once. It is to come\nto that, and the sooner the better for you. It is easy to see that\nyou are badly off for guidance when you take up me as your friend.\"\nWhen she had so spoken Mrs. Askerton got up and went to the door.\n\"No, Clara, do not come with me; not now,\" she said, turning to her\ncompanion, who had risen as though to follow her. \"I will come to you\nsoon, but I would rather be alone now. And, look here, dear; you must\nanswer your cousin's letter. Do so at once, and say that you will go\nto Plaistow. In any event it will be better for you.\"\n\nClara, when she was alone, did answer her cousin's letter, but she\ndid not accept the invitation that had been given her. She assured\nMiss Belton that she was most anxious to know her, and hoped that she\nmight do so before long, either at Plaistow or at Belton; but that\nat present she was under an engagement to stay with her friend Mrs.\nAskerton. In an hour or two Mrs. Askerton returned, and Clara handed\nto her the note to read. \"Then all I can say is you are very silly,\nand don't know on which side your bread is buttered.\" It was evident\nfrom Mrs. Askerton's voice that she had recovered her mood and tone\nof mind. \"I don't suppose it will much signify, as it will all come\nright at last,\" she said afterwards. And then, after luncheon, when\nshe had been for a few minutes with her husband in his own room, she\ntold Clara that the Colonel wanted to speak to her. \"You'll find\nhim as grave as a judge, for he has got something to say to you in\nearnest. Nobody can be so stern as he is when he chooses to put on\nhis wig and gown.\" So Clara went into the Colonel's study, and seated\nherself in a chair which he had prepared for her.\n\nShe remained there for over an hour, and during the hour the\nconversation became very animated. Colonel Askerton's assumed gravity\nhad given way to ordinary eagerness, during which he had walked about\nthe room in the vehemence of his argument; and Clara, in answering\nhim, had also put forth all her strength. She had expected that he\nalso was going to speak to her on the propriety of her going to\nNorfolk; but he made no allusion to that subject, although all that\nhe did say was founded on Will Belton's letter to himself. Belton, in\nspeaking of the cottage, had told Colonel Askerton that Miss Amedroz\nwould be his future landlord, and had then gone on to explain that\nit was his, Belton's, intention to destroy the entail, and allow the\nproperty to descend from the father to the daughter. \"As Miss Amedroz\nis with you now,\" he said, \"may I beg you to take the trouble to\nexplain the matter to her at length, and to make her understand that\nthe estate is now, at this moment, in fact her own. Her possession of\nit does not depend on any act of hers,--or, indeed, upon her own will\nor wish in the matter.\" On this subject Colonel Askerton had argued,\nusing all his skill to make Clara in truth perceive that she was\nher father's heiress,--through the generosity undoubtedly of her\ncousin,--and that she had no alternative but to assume the possession\nwhich was thus thrust upon her.\n\nAnd so eloquent was the Colonel that Clara was staggered, though she\nwas not convinced. \"It is quite impossible,\" she said. \"Though he may\nbe able to make it over to me, I can give it back again.\"\n\n\"I think not. In such a matter as this a lady in your position can\nonly be guided by her natural advisers,--her father's lawyer and\nother family friends.\"\n\n\"I don't know why a young lady should be in any way different from an\nold gentleman.\"\n\n\"But an old gentleman would not hesitate under such circumstances.\nThe entail in itself was a cruelty, and the operation of it on your\npoor brother's death was additionally cruel.\"\n\n\"It is cruel that any one should be poor,\" argued Clara; \"but that\ndoes not take away the right of a rich man to his property.\"\n\nThere was much more of this sort said between them, till Clara was\nat any rate convinced that Colonel Askerton believed that she ought\nto be the owner of the property. And then at last he ventured upon\nanother argument which soon drove Clara out of the room. \"There is,\nI believe, one way in which it can all be made right,\" said he.\n\n\"What way?\" said Clara, forgetting in her eagerness the obviousness\nof the mode which her companion was about to point out.\n\n\"Of course, I know nothing of this myself,\" he said smiling; \"but\nMary thinks that you and your cousin might arrange it between you if\nyou were together.\"\n\n\"You must not listen to what she says about that, Colonel Askerton.\"\n\n\"Must I not? Well; I will not listen to more than I can help; but\nMary, as you know, is a persistent talker. I, at any rate, have done\nmy commission.\" Then Clara left him and was alone for what remained\nof the afternoon.\n\nIt could not be, she said to herself, that the property ought to be\nhers. It would make her miserable, were she once to feel that she had\naccepted it. Some small allowance out of it, coming to her from the\nbrotherly love of her cousin,--some moderate stipend sufficient for\nher livelihood, she thought she could accept from him. It seemed\nto her that it was her destiny to be dependent on charity,--to eat\nbread given to her from the benevolence of a friend; and she thought\nthat she could endure his benevolence better than that of any other.\nBenevolence from Aylmer Park or from Perivale would be altogether\nunendurable.\n\nBut why should it not be as Colonel Askerton had proposed? That this\ncousin of hers loved her with all his heart,--with a constancy for\nwhich she had at first given him no credit, she was well aware. And,\nas regarded herself, she loved him better than all the world beside.\nShe had at last become conscious that she could not now marry Captain\nAylmer without sin,--without false vows, and fatal injury to herself\nand him. To the prospect of that marriage, as her future fate, an\nend must be put at any rate,--an end, if that which had already\ntaken place was not to be regarded as end enough. But yet she had\nbeen engaged to Captain Aylmer,--was engaged to him even now. When\nlast her cousin had mentioned to her Captain Aylmer's name she had\ndeclared that she loved him still. How then could she turn round\nnow, and so soon accept the love of another man? How could she bring\nherself to let her cousin assume to himself the place of a lover,\nwhen it was but the other day that she had rebuked him for expressing\nthe faintest hope in that direction?\n\nBut yet,--yet--! As for going to Plaistow, that was quite out of the\nquestion.\n\n\"So you are to be the heiress after all,\" said Mrs. Askerton to her\nthat night in her bedroom.\n\n\"No; I am not to be the heiress after all,\" said Clara, rising\nagainst her friend impetuously.\n\n\"You'll have to be lady of Belton in one way or the other at any\nrate,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nMISS AMEDROZ IS PURSUED.\n\n\n\"I suppose now, my dear, it may be considered that everything is\nsettled about that young lady,\" said Lady Aylmer to her son, on the\nsame day that Miss Amedroz left Aylmer Park.\n\n\"Nothing is settled, ma'am,\" said the Captain.\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me that after what has passed you intend to\nfollow her up any further.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly endeavour to see her again.\"\n\n\"Then, Frederic, I must tell you that you are very wrong\nindeed;--almost worse than wrong. I would say wicked, only I feel\nsure that you will think better of it. You cannot mean to tell me\nthat you would--marry her after what has taken place?\"\n\n\"The question is whether she would marry me.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense, Frederic. I wonder that you, who are generally so\nclear-sighted, cannot see more plainly than that. She is a scheming,\nartful young woman, who is playing a regular game to catch a\nhusband.\"\n\n\"If that were so, she would have been more humble to you, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, Fred. That's just it. That has been her cleverness. She\ntried that on at first, and found that she could not get round me.\nDon't allow yourself to be deceived by that, I pray. And then there\nis no knowing how she may be bound up with those horrid people, so\nthat she cannot throw them over, even if she would.\"\n\n\"I don't think you understand her, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Oh;--very well. But I understand this, and you had better understand\nit too;--that she will never again enter a house of which I am the\nmistress; nor can I ever enter a house in which she is received.\nIf you choose to make her your wife after that, I have done.\" Lady\nAylmer had not done, or nearly done; but we need hear no more of her\nthreats or entreaties. Her son left Aylmer Park immediately after\nEaster Sunday, and as he went, the mother, nodding her head, declared\nto her daughter that that marriage would never come off, let Clara\nAmedroz be ever so sly, or ever so clever.\n\n\"Think of what I have said to you, Fred,\" said Sir Anthony, as he\ntook his leave of his son.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I will.\"\n\n\"You can't be better off than you are;--you can't, indeed.\" With\nthese words in his ears Captain Aylmer started for London, intending\nto follow Clara down to Belton. He hardly knew his own mind on this\nmatter of his purposed marriage. He was almost inclined to agree\nwith his father that he was very well off as he was. He was almost\ninclined to agree with his mother in her condemnation of Clara's\nconduct. He was almost inclined to think that he had done enough\ntowards keeping the promise made to his aunt on her deathbed,--but\nstill he was not quite contented with himself. He desired to be\nhonest and true, as far as his ideas went of honesty and truth, and\nhis conscience told him that Clara had been treated with cruelty by\nhis mother. I am inclined to think that Lady Aylmer, in spite of her\nhigh experience and character for wisdom, had not fought her battle\naltogether well. No man likes to be talked out of his marriage by his\nmother, and especially not so when the talking takes the shape of\nthreats. When she told him that under no circumstances would she\nagain know Clara Amedroz, he was driven by his spirit of manhood to\ndeclare to himself that that menace from her should not have the\nslightest influence on him. The word or two which his father said was\nmore effective. After all it might be better for him in his peculiar\nposition to have no wife at all. He did begin to believe that he\nhad no need for a wife. He had never before thought so much of his\nfather's example as he did now. Clara was manifestly a hot-tempered\nwoman,--a very hot-tempered woman indeed! Now his mother was also\na hot-tempered woman, and he could see the result in the present\ncondition of his father's life. He resolved that he would follow\nClara to Belton, so that some final settlement might be made between\nthem; but in coming to this resolution he acknowledged to himself\nthat should she decide against him he would not break his heart. She,\nhowever, should have her chance. Undoubtedly it was only right that\nshe should have her chance.\n\nBut the difficulty of the circumstances in which he was placed was\nso great, that it was almost impossible for him to make up his mind\nfixedly to any purpose in reference to Clara. As he passed through\nLondon on his way to Belton he called at Mr. Green's chambers with\nreference to that sum of fifteen hundred pounds, which it was now\nabsolutely necessary that he should make over to Miss Amedroz, and\nfrom Mr. Green he learned that William Belton had given positive\ninstructions as to the destination of the Belton estate. He would not\ninherit it, or have anything to do with it under the entail,--from\nthe effects of which he desired to be made entirely free. Mr. Green,\nwho knew that Captain Aylmer was engaged to marry his client, and\nwho knew nothing of any interruption to that agreement, felt no\nhesitation in explaining all this to Captain Aylmer. \"I suppose you\nhad heard of it before,\" said Mr. Green. Captain Aylmer certainly\nhad heard of it, and had been very much struck by the idea; but up\nto this moment he had not quite believed in it. Coming simply from\nWilliam Belton to Clara Amedroz, such an offer might be no more than\na strong argument used in love-making. \"Take back the property, but\ntake me with it, of course.\" That Captain Aylmer thought might have\nbeen the correct translation of Mr. William Belton's romance. But he\nwas forced to look at the matter differently when he found that it\nhad been put into a lawyer's hands. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I have heard of\nit. Mr. Belton mentioned it to me himself.\" This was not strictly\ntrue. Clara had mentioned it to him; but Belton had come into the\nroom immediately afterwards, and Captain Aylmer might probably have\nbeen mistaken.\n\n\"He's quite in earnest,\" said Mr. Green.\n\n\"Of course, I can say nothing, Mr. Green, as I am myself so nearly\ninterested in the matter. It is a great question, no doubt, how far\nsuch an entail as that should be allowed to operate.\"\n\n\"I think it should stand, as a matter of course. I think Belton is\nwrong,\" said Mr. Green.\n\n\"Of course I can give no opinion,\" said the other.\n\n\"I'll tell you what you can do, Captain Aylmer. You can suggest to\nMiss Amedroz that there should be a compromise. Let them divide it.\nThey are both clients of mine, and in that way I shall do my duty to\neach. Let them divide it. Belton has money enough to buy up the other\nmoiety, and in that way would still be Belton of Belton.\"\n\nCaptain Aylmer had not the slightest objection to such a plan.\nIndeed, he regarded it as in all respects a wise and salutary\narrangement. The moiety of the Belton estate might probably be worth\ntwenty-five thousand pounds, and the addition of such a sum as that\nto his existing means would make all the difference in the world as\nto the expediency of his marriage. His father's arguments would all\nfall to the ground if twenty-five thousand pounds were to be obtained\nin this way; and he had but little doubt that such a change in\naffairs would go far to mitigate his mother's wrath. But he was by\nno means mercenary in his views;--so, at least, he assured himself.\nClara should have her chance with or without the Belton estate,--or\nwith or without the half of it. He was by no means mercenary. Had he\nnot made his offer to her,--and repeated it almost with obstinacy,\nwhen she had no prospect of any fortune? He could always remember\nthat of himself at least; and remembering that now, he could take\na delight in these bright money prospects without having to accuse\nhimself in the slightest degree of mercenary motives. This fortune\nwas a godsend which he could take with clean hands;--if only he\nshould ultimately be able to take the lady who possessed the fortune!\n\nFrom London he wrote to Clara, telling her that he proposed to visit\nher at Belton. His letter was written before he had seen Mr. Green,\nand was not very fervent in its expressions; but, nevertheless, it\nwas a fair letter, written with the intention of giving her a fair\nchance. He had seen with great sorrow,--\"with heartfelt grief,\" that\nquarrel between his mother and his own Clara. Thinking, as he felt\nhimself obliged to think, about Mrs. Askerton, he could not but\nfeel that his mother had cause for her anger. But he himself was\nunprejudiced, and was ready, and anxious also,--the word anxious\nwas underscored,--to carry out his engagement. A few words between\nthem might probably set everything right, and therefore he proposed\nto meet her at the Belton Castle house, at such an hour, on such\na day. He should run down to Perivale on his journey, and perhaps\nClara would let him have a line addressed to him there. Such was his\nletter.\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" said Clara, showing it to Mrs. Askerton\non the afternoon of the day on which she had received it.\n\n\"What do you think of it?\" said Mrs. Askerton. \"I can only hope, that\nhe will not come within the reach of my hands.\"\n\n\"You are not angry with me for showing it to you?\"\n\n\"No;--why should I be angry with you? Of course I knew it all without\nany showing. Do not tell Colonel Askerton, or they will be killing\neach other.\"\n\n\"Of course I shall not tell Colonel Askerton; but I could not help\nshowing this to you.\"\n\n\"And you will meet him?\"\n\n\"Yes; I shall meet him. What else can I do?\"\n\n\"Unless, indeed, you were to write and tell him that it would do no\ngood.\"\n\n\"It will be better that he should come.\"\n\n\"If you allow him to talk you over you will be a wretched woman all\nyour life.\"\n\n\"It will be better that he should come,\" said Clara again. And then\nshe wrote to Captain Aylmer at Perivale, telling him that she would\nbe at the house at the hour he had named, on the day he had named.\n\nWhen that day came she walked across the park a little before the\ntime fixed, not wishing to meet Captain Aylmer before she had reached\nthe house. It was now nearly the middle of April, and the weather was\nsoft and pleasant. It was almost summer again, and as she felt this,\nshe thought of all the events which had occurred since the last\nsummer,--of their agony of grief at the catastrophe which had closed\nher brother's life, of her aunt's death first, and then of her\nfather's following so close upon the other, and of the two offers of\nmarriage made to her,--as to which she was now aware that she had\naccepted the wrong man and rejected the wrong man. She was steadily\nminded, now, at this moment, that before she parted from Captain\nAylmer, her engagement with him should be brought to a close. Now,\nat this coming interview, so much at any rate should be done. She\nhad tried to make herself believe that she felt for him that sort of\naffection which a woman should have for the man she is to marry, but\nshe had failed. She hardly knew whether she had in truth ever loved\nhim; but she was quite sure that she did not love him now. No;--she\nhad done with Aylmer Park, and she could feel thankful, amidst all\nher troubles, that that difficulty should vex her no more. In showing\nCaptain Aylmer's letter to Mrs. Askerton she had made no such promise\nas this, but her mind had been quite made up. \"He certainly shall not\ntalk me over,\" she said to herself as she walked across the park.\n\nBut she could not see her way so clearly out of that further\ndifficulty with regard to her cousin. It might be that she would be\nable to rid herself of the one lover with comparative ease; but she\ncould not bring herself to entertain the idea of accepting the other.\nIt was true that this man longed for her,--desired to call her his\nown, with a wearing, anxious, painful desire which made his heart\ngrievously heavy,--heavy as though with lead hanging to its strings;\nand it was true that Clara knew that it was so. It was true also that\nhis spirit had mastered her spirit, and that his persistence had\nconquered her resistance,--the resistance, that is, of her feelings.\nBut there remained with her a feminine shame, which made it seem to\nher to be impossible that she should now reject Captain Aylmer, and\nas a consequence of that rejection, accept Will Belton's hand. As\nshe thought of this, she could not see her way out of her trouble in\nthat direction with any of that clearness which belonged to her in\nreference to Captain Aylmer.\n\nShe had been an hour in the house before he came, and never did an\nhour go so heavily with her. There was no employment for her about\nthe place, and Mrs. Bunce, the old woman who now lived there, could\nnot understand why her late mistress chose to remain seated among the\nunused furniture. Clara had of course told her that a gentleman was\ncoming. \"Not Mr. Will?\" said the woman. \"No; it is not Mr. Will,\"\nsaid Clara; \"his name is Captain Aylmer.\" \"Oh, indeed.\" And then Mrs.\nBunce looked at her with a mystified look. Why on earth should not\nthe gentleman call on Miss Amedroz at Mrs. Askerton's cottage. \"I'll\nbe sure to show 'un up, when a comes, at any rate,\" said the old\nwoman solemnly;--and Clara felt that it was all very uncomfortable.\n\nAt last the gentleman did come, and was shown up with all the\nceremony of which Mrs. Bunce was capable. \"Here he be, mum.\" Then\nMrs. Bunce paused a moment before she retreated, anxious to learn\nwhether the new comer was a friend or a foe. She concluded from\nthe Captain's manner that he was a very dear friend, and then she\ndeparted.\n\n\"I hope you are not surprised at my coming,\" said Captain Aylmer,\nstill holding Clara by the hand.\n\n\"A little surprised,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"But not annoyed?\"\n\n\"No;--not annoyed.\"\n\n\"As soon as you had left Aylmer Park I felt that it was the right\nthing to do;--the only thing to do,--as I told my mother.\"\n\n\"I hope you have not come in opposition to her wishes,\" said Clara,\nunable to control a slight tone of banter as she spoke.\n\n\"In this matter I found myself compelled to act in accordance with my\nown judgment,\" said he, untouched by her sarcasm.\n\n\"Then I suppose that Lady Aylmer is,--is vexed with you for coming\nhere. I shall be so sorry for that;--so very sorry, as no good can\ncome of it.\"\n\n\"Well;--I am not so sure of that. My mother is a most excellent\nwoman, one for whose opinions on all matters I have the highest\npossible value;--a value so high, that--that--that--\"\n\n\"That you never ought to act in opposition to it. That is what you\nreally mean, Captain Aylmer; and upon my word I think that you are\nright.\"\n\n\"No, Clara; that is not what I mean,--not exactly that. Indeed, just\nat present I mean the reverse of that. There are some things on which\na man must act on his own judgment, irrespectively of the opinions of\nany one else.\"\n\n\"Not of a mother, Captain Aylmer?\"\n\n\"Yes;--of a mother. That is to say, a man must do so. With a lady of\ncourse it is different. I was very, very sorry that there should have\nbeen any unpleasantness at Aylmer Park.\"\n\n\"It was not pleasant to me, certainly.\"\n\n\"Nor to any of us, Clara.\"\n\n\"At any rate, it need not be repeated.\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"No;--it certainty need not be repeated. I know now that I was wrong\nto go to Aylmer Park. I felt sure beforehand that there were many\nthings as to which I could not possibly agree with Lady Aylmer, and I\nought not to have gone.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all, Clara.\"\n\n\"I do see it now.\"\n\n\"I can't understand you. What things? Why should you be determined to\ndisagree with my mother? Surely you ought at any rate to endeavour to\nthink as she thinks.\"\n\n\"I cannot do that, Captain Aylmer.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you speak in this way. I have come here all the\nway from Yorkshire to try to put things straight between us; but you\nreceive me as though you would remember nothing but that unpleasant\nquarrel.\"\n\n\"It was so unpleasant,--so very unpleasant! I had better speak out\nthe truth at once. I think that Lady Aylmer ill-used me cruelly. I\ndo. No one can talk me out of that conviction. Of course I am sorry\nto be driven to say as much to you,--and I should never have said\nit, had you not come here. But when you speak of me and your mother\ntogether, I must say what I feel. Your mother and I, Captain Aylmer,\nare so opposed to each other, not only in feeling, but in opinions\nalso, that it is impossible that we should be friends;--impossible\nthat we should not be enemies if we are brought together.\"\n\nThis she said with great energy, looking intently into his face as\nshe spoke. He was seated near her, on a chair from which he was\nleaning over towards her, holding his hat in both hands between his\nlegs. Now, as he listened to her, he drew his chair still nearer,\nridding himself of his hat, which he left upon the carpet, and\nkeeping his eyes upon hers as though he were fascinated. \"I am sorry\nto hear you speak like this,\" he said.\n\n\"It is best to say the truth.\"\n\n\"But, Clara, if you intend to be my wife--\"\n\n\"Oh, no;--that is impossible now.\"\n\n\"What is impossible?\"\n\n\"Impossible that I should become your wife. Indeed I have convinced\nmyself that you do not wish it.\"\n\n\"But I do wish it.\"\n\n\"No;--no. If you will question your heart about it quietly, you will\nfind that you do not wish it.\"\n\n\"You wrong me, Clara.\"\n\n\"At any rate it cannot be so.\"\n\n\"I will not take that answer from you,\" he said, getting up from his\nchair, and walking once up and down the room. Then he returned to it,\nand repeated his words. \"I will not take that answer from you. An\nengagement such as ours cannot be put aside like an old glove. You\ndo not mean to tell me that all that has been between us is to mean\nnothing.\" There was something now like feeling in his tone, something\nlike passion in his gesture, and Clara, though she had no thought\nof changing her purpose, was becoming unhappy at the idea of his\nunhappiness.\n\n\"It has meant nothing,\" she said. \"We have been like children\ntogether, playing at being in love. It is a game from which you will\ncome out scatheless, but I have been scalded.\"\n\n\"Scalded!\"\n\n\"Well;--never mind. I do not mean to complain, and certainly not of\nyou.\"\n\n\"I have come here all the way from Yorkshire in order that things may\nbe put right between us.\"\n\n\"You have been very good,--very good to come, and I will not say that\nI regret your trouble. It is best, I think, that we should meet each\nother once more face to face, so that we may understand each other.\nThere was no understanding anything during those terrible days at\nAylmer Park.\" Then she paused, but as he did not speak at once she\nwent on. \"I do not blame you for anything that has taken place, but I\nam quite sure of this,--that you and I could never be happy together\nas man and wife.\"\n\n\"I do not know why you say so; I do not indeed.\"\n\n\"You would disapprove of everything that I should do. You do\ndisapprove of what I am doing now.\"\n\n\"Disapprove of what?\"\n\n\"I am staying with my friend, Mrs. Askerton.\"\n\nHe felt that this was hard upon him. As she had shown herself\ninclined to withdraw herself from him, he had become more resolute in\nhis desire to follow her up, and to hold by his engagement. He was\nnot employed now in giving her another chance,--as he had proposed to\nhimself to do,--but was using what eloquence he had to obtain another\nchance for himself. Lady Aylmer had almost made him believe that\nClara would be the suppliant, but now he was the suppliant himself.\nIn his anxiety to keep her he was willing even to pass over her\nterrible iniquity in regard to Mrs. Askerton,--that great sin which\nhad led to all these troubles. He had once written to her about Mrs.\nAskerton, using very strong language, and threatening her with his\nmother's full displeasure. At that time Mrs. Askerton had simply been\nher friend. There had been no question then of her taking refuge\nunder that woman's roof. Now she had repelled Lady Aylmer's counsels\nwith scorn, was living as a guest in Mrs. Askerton's house; and yet\nhe was willing to pass over the Askerton difficulty without a word.\nHe was willing not only to condone past offences, but to wink at\nexisting iniquity! But she,--she who was the sinner, would not permit\nof this. She herself dragged up Mrs. Askerton's name, and seemed to\nglory in her own shame.\n\n\"I had not intended,\" said he, \"to speak of your friend.\"\n\n\"I only mention her to show how impossible it is that we should ever\nagree upon some subjects,--as to which a husband and wife should\nalways be of one mind. I knew this from the moment in which I got\nyour letter,--and only that I was a coward I should have said so\nthen.\"\n\n\"And you mean to quarrel with me altogether?\"\n\n\"No;--why should we quarrel?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" said he.\n\n\"But I wish it to be settled,--quite settled, as from the nature of\nthings it must be, that there shall be no attempt at renewal of our\nengagement. After what has passed, how could I enter your mother's\nhouse?\"\n\n\"But you need not enter it.\" Now in his emergency he was willing\nto give up anything,--everything. He had been prepared to talk her\nover into a reconciliation with his mother, to admit that there had\nbeen faults on both sides, to come down from his high pedestal and\ndiscuss the matter as though Clara and his mother stood upon the same\nfooting. Having recognised the spirit of his lady-love, he had told\nhimself that so much indignity as that must be endured. But now, he\nhad been carried so far beyond this, that he was willing, in the\nsudden vehemence of his love, to throw his mother over altogether,\nand to accede to any terms which Clara might propose to him. \"Of\ncourse, I would wish you to be friends,\" he said, using now all the\ntones of a suppliant; \"but if you found that it could not be so--\"\n\n\"Do you think that I would divide you from your mother?\"\n\n\"There need be no question as to that.\"\n\n\"Ah;--there you are wrong. There must be such questions. I should\nhave thought of it sooner.\"\n\n\"Clara, you are more to me than my mother. Ten times more.\" As he\nsaid this he came up and knelt down beside her. \"You are everything\nto me. You will not throw me over.\" He was a suppliant indeed, and\nsuch supplications are very potent with women. Men succeed often by\nthe simple earnestness of their prayers. Women cannot refuse to give\nthat which is asked for with so much of the vehemence of true desire.\n\"Clara, you have promised to be my wife. You have twice promised; and\ncan have no right to go back because you are displeased with what my\nmother may have said. I am not responsible for my mother. Clara, say\nthat you will be my wife.\" As he spoke he strove to take her hand,\nand his voice sounded as though there were in truth something of\npassion in his heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING TO TELL.\n\n\nCaptain Aylmer had never before this knelt to Clara Amedroz. Such\nkneeling on the part of lovers used to be the fashion because lovers\nin those days held in higher value than they do now that which they\nasked their ladies to give,--or because they pretended to do so. The\nforms at least of supplication were used; whereas in these wiser days\nAugustus simply suggests to Caroline that they two might as well\nmake fools of themselves together,--and so the thing is settled\nwithout the need of much prayer. Captain Aylmer's engagement had\nbeen originally made somewhat after this fashion. He had not,\nindeed, spoken of the thing contemplated as a folly, not being a\nman given to little waggeries of that nature; but he had been calm,\nunenthusiastic, and reasonable. He had not attempted to evince any\npassion, and would have been quite content that Clara should believe\nthat he married as much from obedience to his aunt as from love\nfor herself, had he not found that Clara would not take him at all\nunder such a conviction. But though she had declined to come to\nhim after that fashion,--though something more than that had been\nneeded,--still she had been won easily, and, therefore, lightly\nprized. I fear that it is so with everything that we value,--with our\nhorses, our houses, our wines, and, above all, with our women. Where\nis the man who has heart and soul big enough to love a woman with\nincreased force of passion because she has at once recognised in him\nall that she has herself desired? Captain Aylmer having won his spurs\neasily, had taken no care in buckling them, and now found, to his\nsurprise, that he was like to lose them. He had told himself that he\nwould only be too glad to shuffle his feet free of their bondage; but\nnow that they were going from him, he began to find that they were\nvery necessary for the road that he was to travel. \"Clara,\" he said,\nkneeling by her side, \"you are more to me than my mother; ten times\nmore!\"\n\nThis was all new to her. Hitherto, though she had never desired\nthat he should assume such attitude as this, she had constantly\nbeen unconsciously wounded by his coldness,--by his cold propriety\nand unbending self-possession. His cold propriety and unbending\nself-possession were gone now, and he was there at her feet. Such an\nargument, used at Aylmer Park, would have conquered her,--would have\nwon her at once, in spite of herself; but now she was minded to be\nresolute. She had sworn to herself that she would not peril herself,\nor him, by joining herself to a man with whom she had so little\nsympathy, and who apparently had none with her. But in what way\nwas she to answer such a prayer as that which was now made to her?\nThe man who addressed her was entitled to use all the warmth of an\naccepted lover. He only asked for that which had already been given\nto him.\n\n\"Captain Aylmer--,\" she began.\n\n\"Why is it to be Captain Aylmer? What have I done that you should use\nme in this way? It was not I who,--who,--made you unhappy at Aylmer\nPark.\"\n\n\"I will not go back to that. It is of no use. Pray get up. It shocks\nme to see you in this way.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, that it is once more all right between us. Say that,\nand I shall be happier than I ever was before;--yes, than I ever was\nbefore. I know how much I love you now, how sore it would be to lose\nyou. I have been wrong. I had not thought enough of that, but I will\nthink of it now.\"\n\nShe found that the task before her was very difficult,--so difficult\nthat she almost broke down in performing it. It would have been so\neasy and, for the moment, so pleasant to have yielded. He had his\nhand upon her arm, having attempted to take her hand. In preventing\nthat she had succeeded, but she could not altogether make herself\nfree from him without rising. For a moment she had paused,--paused as\nthough she were about to yield. For a moment, as he looked into her\neyes, he had thought that he would again be victorious. Perhaps there\nwas something in his glance, some too visible return of triumph to\nhis eyes, which warned her of her danger. \"No!\" she said, getting up\nand walking away from him; \"no!\"\n\n\"And what does 'no' mean, Clara?\" Then he also rose, and stood\nleaning on the table. \"Does it mean that you will be forsworn?\"\n\n\"It means this,--that I will not come between you and your mother;\nthat I will not be taken into a family in which I am scorned; that I\nwill not go to Aylmer Park myself or be the means of preventing you\nfrom going there.\"\n\n\"There need be no question of Aylmer Park.\"\n\n\"There shall be none!\"\n\n\"But, so much being allowed, you will be my wife?\"\n\n\"No, Captain Aylmer;--no. I cannot be your wife. Do not press it\nfurther; you must know that on such a subject I would think much\nbefore I answered you. I have thought much, and I know that I am\nright.\"\n\n\"And your promised word is to go for nothing?\"\n\n\"If it will comfort you to say so, you may say it. If you do not\nperceive that the mistake made between us has been as much your\nmistake as mine, and has injured me more than it has injured you, I\nwill not remind you of it,--will never remind you of it after this.\"\n\n\"But there has been no mistake,--and there shall be no injury.\"\n\n\"Ah, Captain Aylmer! you do not understand; you cannot understand.\nI would not for worlds reproach you; but do you think I suffered\nnothing from your mother?\"\n\n\"And must I pay for her sins?\"\n\n\"There shall be no paying, no punishment, and no reproaches. There\nshall be none at least from me. But,--do not think that I speak in\nanger or in pride,--I will not marry into Lady Aylmer's family.\"\n\n\"This is too bad,--too bad! After all that is past, it is too bad!\"\n\n\"What can I say? Would you advise me to do that which would make us\nboth wretched?\"\n\n\"It would not make me wretched. It would make me happy. It would\nsatisfy me altogether.\"\n\n\"It cannot be, Captain Aylmer. It cannot be. When I speak to you in\nthat way, will you not let it be final?\"\n\nHe paused a moment before he spoke again, and then he turned sharp\nupon her. \"Tell me this, Clara; do you love me? Have you ever loved\nme?\" She did not answer him, but stood there, listening quietly to\nhis accusations. \"You have never loved me, and yet you have allowed\nyourself to say that you did. Is not that true?\" Still she did not\nanswer. \"I ask you whether that is not true?\" But though he asked\nher, and paused for an answer, looking the while full into her face,\nyet she did not speak. \"And now I suppose you will become your\ncousin's wife?\" he said. \"It will suit you to change, and to say that\nyou love him.\"\n\nThen at last she spoke. \"I did not think that you would have treated\nme in this way, Captain Aylmer! I did not expect that you would\ninsult me!\"\n\n\"I have not insulted you.\"\n\n\"But your manner to me makes my task easier than I could have hoped\nit to be. You asked me whether I ever loved you? I once thought that\nI did so; and so thinking, told you, without reserve, all my feeling.\nWhen I came to find that I had been mistaken, I conceived myself\nbound by my engagement to rectify my own error as best I could; and I\nresolved, wrongly,--as I now think, very wrongly,--that I could learn\nas your wife to love you. Then came circumstances which showed me\nthat a release would be good for both of us, and which justified me\nin accepting it. No girl could be bound by any engagement to a man\nwho looked on and saw her treated in his own home, by his own mother,\nas you saw me treated at Aylmer Park. I claim to be released myself,\nand I know that this release is as good for you as it is for me.\"\n\n\"I am the best judge of that.\"\n\n\"For myself at any rate I will judge. For myself I have decided. Now\nI have answered the questions which you asked me as to my love for\nyourself. To that other question which you have thought fit to put\nto me about my cousin, I refuse to give any answer whatsoever.\" Then,\nhaving said so much, she walked out of the room, closing the door\nbehind her, and left him standing there alone.\n\nWe need not follow her as she went up, almost mechanically, into her\nown room,--the room that used to be her own,--and then shut herself\nin, waiting till she should be assured, first by sounds in the house,\nand then by silence, that he was gone. That she fell away greatly\nfrom the majesty of her demeanour when she was thus alone, and\ndescended to the ordinary ways of troubled females, we may be quite\nsure. But to her there was no further difficulty. Her work for the\nday was done. In due time she would take herself to the cottage, and\nall would be well, or, at any rate, comfortable with her. But what\nwas he to do? How was he to get himself out of the house, and take\nhimself back to London? While he had been in pursuit of her, and\nwhen he was leaving his vehicle at the public-house in the village\nof Belton, he,--like some other invading generals,--had failed to\nprovide adequately for his retreat. When he was alone he took a turn\nor two about the room, half thinking that Clara would return to him.\nShe could hardly leave him alone in a strange house,--him, who, as he\nhad twice told her, had come all the way from Yorkshire to see her.\nBut she did not return, and gradually he came to understand that he\nmust provide for his own retreat without assistance. He was hardly\naware, even now, how greatly he had transcended his usual modes of\nspeech and action, both in the energy of his supplication and in the\nviolence of his rebuke. He had been lifted for awhile out of himself\nby the excitement of his position, and now that he was subsiding\ninto quiescence, he was unconscious that he had almost mounted into\npassion,--that he had spoken of love very nearly with eloquence. But\nhe did recognise this as a fact,--that Clara was not to be his wife,\nand that he had better get back from Belton to London as quickly as\npossible. It would be well for him to teach himself to look back on\nthe result of his aunt's dying request as an episode in his life\nsatisfactorily concluded. His mother had undoubtedly been right.\nClara, he could now see, would have led him a devil of a life; and\neven had she come to him possessed of a moiety of the property,--a\nsupposition as to which he had very strong doubts,--still she might\nhave been dear at the money. \"No real feeling,\" he said to himself,\nas he walked about the room,--\"none whatever; and then so deficient\nin delicacy!\" But still he was discontented,--because he had been\nrejected, and therefore tried to make himself believe that he could\nstill have her if he chose to persevere. \"But no,\" he said, as he\ncontinued to pace the room, \"I have done everything,--more than\neverything that honour demands. I shall not ask her again. It is\nher own fault. She is an imperious woman, and my mother read her\ncharacter aright.\" It did not occur to him, as he thus consoled\nhimself for what he had lost, that his mother's accusation against\nClara had been altogether of a different nature. When we console\nourselves by our own arguments, we are not apt to examine their\naccuracy with much strictness.\n\nBut whether he were consoled or not, it was necessary that he should\ngo, and in his going he felt himself to be ill-treated. He left the\nroom, and as he went down-stairs was disturbed and tormented by the\ncreaking of his own boots. He tried to be dignified as he walked\nthrough the hall, and was troubled at his failure, though he was not\nconscious of any one looking at him. Then it was grievous that he\nshould have to let himself out of the front door without attendance.\nAt ordinary times he thought as little of such things as most men,\nand would not be aware whether he opened a door for himself or had\nit opened for him by another;--but now there was a distressing\nawkwardness in the necessity for self-exertion. He did not know the\nturn of the handle, and was unfamiliar with the manner of exit. He\nwas being treated with indignity, and before he had escaped from\nthe house had come to think that the Amedroz and Belton people were\nsomewhat below him. He endeavoured to go out without a noise, but\nthere was a slam of the door, without which he could not get the lock\nto work; and Clara, up in her own room, knew all about it.\n\n\"Carriage;--yes; of course I want the carriage,\" he said to the\nunfortunate boy at the public-house. \"Didn't you hear me say that\nI wanted it?\" He had come down with a pair of horses, and as he saw\nthem being put to the vehicle he wished he had been contented with\none. As he was standing there, waiting, a gentleman rode by, and\nthe boy, in answer to his question, told him that the horseman\nwas Colonel Askerton. Before the day was over Colonel Askerton\nwould probably know all that had happened to him. \"Do move a little\nquicker; will you?\" he said to the boy and the old man who was to\ndrive him. Then he got into the carriage, and was driven out of\nBelton, devoutly purposing that he never would return; and as he made\nhis way back to Perivale he thought of a certain Lady Emily, who\nwould, as he assured himself, have behaved much better than Clara\nAmedroz had done in any such scene as that which had just taken\nplace.\n\nWhen Clara was quite sure that Captain Aylmer was off the premises,\nshe, too, descended, but she did not immediately leave the house. She\nwalked through the room, and rang for the old woman, and gave certain\ndirections,--as to the performance of which she certainly was not\nvery anxious, and was careful to make Mrs. Bunce understand that\nnothing had occurred between her and the gentleman that was either\nexalting or depressing in its nature. \"I suppose Captain Aylmer went\nout, Mrs. Bunce?\" \"Oh yes, miss, a went out. I stood and see'd un\nfrom the top of the kitchen stairs.\" \"You might have opened the\ndoor for him, Mrs. Bunce.\" \"Indeed then I never thought of it, miss,\nseeing the house so empty and the like.\" Clara said that it did not\nsignify; and then, after an hour of composure, she walked back across\nthe park to the cottage.\n\n\"Well?\" said Mrs. Askerton as soon as Clara was inside the\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Clara.\n\n\"What have you got to tell? Do tell me what you have to tell.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to tell.\"\n\n\"Clara, that is impossible. Have you seen him? I know you have seen\nhim, because he went by from the house about an hour since.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; I have seen him.\"\n\n\"And what have you said to him?\"\n\n\"Pray do not ask me these questions just now. I have got to think of\nit all;--to think what he did say and what I said.\"\n\n\"But you will tell me.\"\n\n\"Yes; I suppose so.\" Then Mrs. Askerton was silent on the subject\nfor the remainder of the day, allowing Clara even to go to bed\nwithout another question. And nothing was asked on the following\nmorning,--nothing till the usual time for the writing of letters.\n\n\"Shall you have anything for the post?\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"There is plenty of time yet.\"\n\n\"Not too much if you mean to go out at all. Come, Clara, you had\nbetter write to him at once.\"\n\n\"Write to whom? I don't know that I have any letter to write at all.\"\nThen there was a pause. \"As far as I can see,\" she said, \"I may give\nup writing altogether for the future, unless some day you may care to\nhear from me.\"\n\n\"But you are not going away.\"\n\n\"Not just yet;--if you will keep me. To tell you the truth, Mrs.\nAskerton, I do not yet know where on earth to take myself.\"\n\n\"Wait here till we turn you out.\"\n\n\"I have got to put my house in order. You know what I mean. The job\nought not to be a troublesome one, for it is a very small house.\"\n\n\"I suppose I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"It will not be a very smart establishment. But I must look it all in\nthe face; must I not? Though it were to be no house at all, I cannot\nstay here all my life.\"\n\n\"Yes, you may. You have lost Aylmer Park because you were too noble\nnot to come to us.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Clara, speaking aloud, with bright eyes,--almost with her\nhands clenched. \"No;--I deny that.\"\n\n\"I shall choose to think so for my own purposes. Clara, you are\nsavage to me;--almost always savage; but next to him I love you\nbetter than all the world beside. And so does he. 'It's her courage,'\nhe said to me the other day. 'That she should dare to do as she\npleases here, is nothing; but to have dared to persevere in the\nfangs of that old dragon,'--it was just what he said,--'that was\nwonderful!'\"\n\n\"There is an end of the old dragon now, so far as I am concerned.\"\n\n\"Of course there is;--and of the young dragon too. You wouldn't have\nhad the heart to keep me in suspense if you had accepted him again.\nYou couldn't have been so pleasant last night if that had been so.\"\n\n\"I did not know I was very pleasant.\"\n\n\"Yes, you were. You were soft and gracious,--gracious for you, at\nleast. And now, dear, do tell me about it. Of course I am dying to\nknow.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to tell.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense. There must be a thousand things to tell. At any\nrate it is quite decided?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is quite decided.\"\n\n\"All the dragons, old and young, are banished into outer darkness.\"\n\n\"Either that, or else they are to have all the light to themselves.\"\n\n\"Such light as glimmers through the gloom of Aylmer Park. And was he\ncontented? I hope not. I hope you had him on his knees before he left\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why should you hope that? How can you talk such nonsense?\"\n\n\"Because I wish that he should recognise what he has lost;--that he\nshould know that he has been a fool;--a mean fool.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton, I will not have him spoken of like that. He is a man\nvery estimable,--of estimable qualities.\"\n\n\"Fiddle-de-dee. He is an ape,--a monkey to be carried on his mother's\norgan. His only good quality was that you could have carried him on\nyours. I can tell you one thing;--there is not a woman breathing that\nwill ever carry William Belton on hers. Whoever his wife may be, she\nwill have to dance to his piping.\"\n\n\"With all my heart;--and I hope the tunes will be good.\"\n\n\"But I wish I could have been present to have heard what\npassed;--hidden, you know, behind a curtain. You won't tell me?\"\n\n\"I will tell you not a word more.\"\n\n\"Then I will get it out from Mrs. Bunce. I'll be bound she was\nlistening.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bunce will have nothing to tell you; I do not know why you\nshould be so curious.\"\n\n\"Answer me one question at least:--when it came to the last, did he\nwant to go on with it? Was the final triumph with him or with you?\"\n\n\"There was no final triumph. Such things, when they have to end, do\nnot end triumphantly.\"\n\n\"And is that to be all?\"\n\n\"Yes;--that is to be all.\"\n\n\"And you say that you have no letter to write.\"\n\n\"None;--no letter; none at present; none about this affair. Captain\nAylmer, no doubt, will write to his mother, and then all those who\nare concerned will have been told.\"\n\nClara Amedroz held her purpose and wrote no letter, but Mrs. Askerton\nwas not so discreet, or so indiscreet, as the case might be. She did\nwrite,--not on that day or on the next, but before a week had passed\nby. She wrote to Norfolk, telling Clara not a word of her letter, and\nby return of post the answer came. But the answer was for Clara, not\nfor Mrs. Askerton, and was as follows:--\n\n\n   Plaistow Hall, April, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR CLARA,\n\n   I don't know whether I ought to tell you but I suppose I\n   may as well tell you, that Mary has had a letter from Mrs.\n   Askerton. It was a kind, obliging letter, and I am very\n   grateful to her. She has told us that you have separated\n   yourself altogether from the Aylmer Park people. I don't\n   suppose you'll think I ought to pretend to be very sorry.\n   I can't be sorry, even though I know how much you have\n   lost in a worldly point of view. I could not bring myself\n   to like Captain Aylmer, though I tried hard.\n\nOh Mr. Belton, Mr. Belton!\n\n   He and I never could have been friends, and it is no use\n   my pretending regret that you have quarrelled with them.\n   But that, I suppose, is all over, and I will not say a\n   word more about the Aylmers.\n\n   I am writing now chiefly at Mary's advice, and because she\n   says that something should be settled about the estate. Of\n   course it is necessary that you should feel yourself to be\n   the mistress of your own income, and understand exactly\n   your own position. Mary says that this should be arranged\n   at once, so that you may be able to decide how and\n   where you will live. I therefore write to say that I\n   will have nothing to do with your father's estate at\n   Belton;--nothing, that is, for myself. I have written to\n   Mr. Green to tell him that you are to be considered as the\n   heir. If you will allow me to undertake the management of\n   the property as your agent, I shall be delighted. I think\n   I could do it as well as any one else: and, as we agreed\n   that we would always be dear and close friends, I think\n   that you will not refuse me the pleasure of serving you in\n   this way.\n\n   And now Mary has a proposition to make, as to which she\n   will write herself to-morrow, but she has permitted me to\n   speak of it first. If you will accept her as a visitor,\n   she will go to you at Belton. She thinks, and I think too,\n   that you ought to know each other. I suppose nothing would\n   make you come here, at present, and therefore she must\n   go to you. She thinks that all about the estate would be\n   settled more comfortably if you two were together. At any\n   rate, it would be very nice for her,--and I think you\n   would like my sister Mary. She proposes to start about the\n   10th of May. I should take her as far as London and see\n   her off, and she would bring her own maid with her. In\n   this way she thinks that she would get as far as Taunton\n   very well. She had, perhaps, better stay there for one\n   night, but that can all be settled if you will say that\n   you will receive her at the house.\n\n   I cannot finish my letter without saying one word for\n   myself. You know what my feelings have been, and I think\n   you know that they still are, and always must be, the\n   same. From almost the first moment that I saw you I have\n   loved you. When you refused me I was very unhappy; but\n   I thought I might still have a chance, and therefore I\n   resolved to try again. Then, when I heard that you were\n   engaged to Captain Aylmer, I was indeed broken-hearted. Of\n   course I could not be angry with you. I was not angry, but\n   I was simply broken-hearted. I found that I loved you so\n   much that I could not make myself happy without you. It\n   was all of no use, for I knew that you were to be married\n   to Captain Aylmer. I knew it, or thought that I knew it.\n   There was nothing to be done,--only I knew that I was\n   wretched. I suppose it is selfishness, but I felt, and\n   still feel, that unless I can have you for my wife, I\n   cannot be happy or care for anything. Now you are free\n   again,--free, I mean, from Captain Aylmer;--and how is it\n   possible that I should not again have a hope? Nothing but\n   your marriage or death could keep me from hoping.\n\n   I don't know much about the Aylmers. I know nothing of\n   what has made you quarrel with the people at Aylmer\n   Park;--nor do I want to know. To me you are once more that\n   Clara Amedroz with whom I used to walk in Belton Park,\n   with your hand free to be given wherever your heart can\n   go with it. While it is free I shall always ask for it.\n   I know that it is in many ways above my reach. I quite\n   understand that in education and habits of thinking you\n   are my superior. But nobody can love you better than I do.\n   I sometimes fancy that nobody could ever love you so well.\n   Mary thinks that I ought to allow a time to go by before\n   I say all this again;--but what is the use of keeping it\n   back? It seems to me to be more honest to tell you at once\n   that the only thing in the world for which I care one\n   straw is that you should be my wife.\n\n   Your most affectionate Cousin,\n\n   WILLIAM BELTON.\n\n\n\"Miss Belton is coming here, to the castle, in a fortnight,\" said\nClara that morning at breakfast. Both Colonel Askerton and his wife\nwere in the room, and she was addressing herself chiefly to the\nformer.\n\n\"Indeed, Miss Belton! And is he coming?\" said Colonel Askerton.\n\n\"So you have heard from Plaistow?\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"Yes;--in answer to your letter. No, Colonel Askerton, my cousin\nWilliam is not coming. But his sister purposes to be here, and I must\ngo up to the house and get it ready.\"\n\n\"That will do when the time comes,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\n\"I did not mean quite immediately.\"\n\n\"And are you to be her guest, or is she to be yours?\" said Colonel\nAskerton.\n\n\"It's her brother's home, and therefore I suppose I must be hers.\nIndeed it must be so, as I have no means of entertaining any one.\"\n\n\"Something, no doubt, will be settled,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"Oh, what a weary word that is,\" said Clara; \"weary, at least, for\na woman's ears! It sounds of poverty and dependence, and endless\ntrouble given to others, and all the miseries of female dependence.\nIf I were a young man I should be allowed to settle for myself.\"\n\n\"There would be no question about the property in that case,\" said\nthe Colonel.\n\n\"And there need be no question now,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\nWhen the two women were alone together, Clara, of course, scolded her\nfriend for having written to Norfolk without letting it be known that\nshe was doing so;--scolded her, and declared how vain it was for her\nto make useless efforts for an unattainable end; but Mrs. Askerton\nalways managed to slip out of these reproaches, neither asserting\nherself to be right, nor owning herself to be wrong. \"But you must\nanswer his letter,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course I shall do that.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew what he said.\"\n\n\"I shan't show it you, if you mean that.\"\n\n\"All the same I wish I knew what he said.\"\n\nClara, of course, did answer the letter; but she wrote her answer to\nMary, sending, however, one little scrap to Mary's brother. She wrote\nto Mary at great length, striving to explain, with long and laborious\narguments, that it was quite impossible that she should accept the\nBelton estate from her cousin. That subject, however, and the manner\nof her future life, she would discuss with her dear cousin Mary, when\nMary should have arrived. And then Clara said how she would go to\nTaunton to meet her cousin, and how she would prepare William's house\nfor the reception of William's sister; and how she would love her\ncousin when she should come to know her. All of which was exceedingly\nproper and pretty. Then there was a little postscript, \"Give the\nenclosed to William.\" And this was the note to William:--\n\n\n   DEAR WILLIAM,\n\n   Did you not say that you would be my brother? Be my\n   brother always. I will accept from your hands all that\n   a brother could do; and when that arrangement is quite\n   fixed, I will love you as much as Mary loves you, and\n   trust you as completely; and I will be obedient, as a\n   younger sister should be.\n\n   Your loving Sister,\n\n   C. A.\n\n\n\"It's all no good,\" said William Belton, as he crunched the note in\nhis hand. \"I might as well shoot myself. Get out of the way there,\nwill you?\" And the injured groom scudded across the farm-yard,\nknowing that there was something wrong with his master.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nMARY BELTON.\n\n\nIt was about the middle of the pleasant month of May when Clara\nAmedroz again made that often repeated journey to Taunton, with the\nobject of meeting Mary Belton. She had transferred herself and her\nown peculiar belongings back from the cottage to the house, and had\nagain established herself there so that she might welcome her new\nfriend. But she was not satisfied with simply receiving her guest at\nBelton, and therefore she made the journey to Taunton, and settled\nherself for the night at the inn. She was careful to get a bedroom\nfor an \"invalid lady,\" close to the sitting-room, and before she went\ndown to the station she saw that the cloth was laid for tea, and that\nthe tea parlour had been made to look as pleasant as was possible\nwith an inn parlour.\n\nShe was very nervous as she stood upon the platform waiting for the\nnew comer to show herself. She knew that Mary was a cripple, but did\nnot know how far her cousin was disfigured by her infirmity; and\nwhen she saw a pale-faced little woman, somewhat melancholy, but yet\npretty withal, with soft, clear eyes, and only so much appearance\nof a stoop as to soften the hearts of those who saw her, Clara was\nagreeably surprised, and felt herself to be suddenly relieved of an\nunpleasant weight. She could talk to the woman she saw there, as to\nany other woman, without the painful necessity of treating her always\nas an invalid. \"I think you are Miss Belton?\" she said, holding out\nher hand. The likeness between Mary and her brother was too great to\nallow of Clara being mistaken.\n\n\"And you are Clara Amedroz? It is so good of you to come to meet me!\"\n\n\"I thought you would be dull in a strange town by yourself.\"\n\n\"It will be much nicer to have you with me.\"\n\nThen they went together up to the inn; and when they had taken their\nbonnets off, Mary Belton kissed her cousin. \"You are very nearly what\nI fancied you,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Am I? I hope you fancied me to be something that you could like.\"\n\n\"Something that I could love very dearly. You are a little taller\nthan what Will said; but then a gentleman is never a judge of a\nlady's height. And he said you were thin.\"\n\n\"I am not very fat.\"\n\n\"No; not very fat; but neither are you thin. Of course, you know, I\nhave thought a great deal about you. It seems as though you had come\nto be so very near to us; and blood is thicker than water, is it not?\nIf cousins are not friends, who can be?\"\n\nIn the course of that evening they became very confidential together,\nand Clara thought that she could love Mary Belton better than any\nwoman that she had ever known. Of course they were talking about\nWilliam, and Clara was at first in constant fear lest some word\nshould be said on her lover's behalf,--some word which would drive\nher to declare that she would not admit him as a lover; but Mary\nabstained from the subject with marvellous care and tact. Though she\nwas talking through the whole evening of her brother, she so spoke\nof him as almost to make Clara believe that she could not have heard\nof that episode in his life. Mrs. Askerton would have dashed at the\nsubject at once; but then, as Clara told herself, Mary Belton was\nbetter than Mrs. Askerton.\n\nA few words were said about the estate, and they originated in\nClara's declaration that Mary would have to be regarded as the\nmistress of the house to which they were going. \"I cannot agree to\nthat,\" said Mary.\n\n\"But the house is William's, you know,\" said Clara.\n\n\"He says not.\"\n\n\"But of course that must be nonsense, Mary.\"\n\n\"It is very evident that you know nothing of Plaistow ways, or you\nwould not say that anything coming from William was nonsense. We are\naccustomed to regard all his words as law, and when he says that a\nthing is to be so, it always is so.\"\n\n\"Then he is a tyrant at home.\"\n\n\"A beneficent despot. Some despots, you know, always were\nbeneficent.\"\n\n\"He won't have his way in this thing.\"\n\n\"I'll leave you and him to fight about that, my dear. I am so\ncompletely under his thumb that I always obey him in everything. You\nmust not, therefore, expect to range me on your side.\"\n\nThe next day they were at Belton Castle, and in a very few hours\nClara felt that she was quite at home with her cousin. On the second\nday Mrs. Askerton came up and called,--according to an arrangement to\nthat effect made between her and Clara. \"I'll stay away if you like\nit,\" Mrs. Askerton had said. But Clara had urged her to come, arguing\nwith her that she was foolish to be thinking always of her own\nmisfortune. \"Of course I am always thinking of it,\" she had replied,\n\"and always thinking that other people are thinking of it. Your\ncousin, Miss Belton, knows all my history, of course. But what\nmatters? I believe it would be better that everybody should know it.\nI suppose she's very straight-laced and prim.\" \"She is not prim at\nall,\" said Clara. \"Well, I'll come,\" said Mrs. Askerton, \"but I shall\nnot be a bit surprised if I hear that she goes back to Norfolk the\nnext day.\"\n\nSo Mrs. Askerton came, and Miss Belton did not go back to Norfolk.\nIndeed, at the end of the visit, Mrs. Askerton had almost taught\nherself to believe that William Belton had kept his secret, even from\nhis sister. \"She's a dear little woman,\" Mrs. Askerton afterwards\nsaid to Clara.\n\n\"Is she not?\"\n\n\"And so thoroughly like a lady.\"\n\n\"Yes; I think she is a lady.\"\n\n\"A princess among ladies! What a pretty little conscious way she has\nof asserting herself when she has an opinion and means to stick to\nit! I never saw a woman who got more strength out of her weakness.\nWho would dare to contradict her?\"\n\n\"But then she knows everything so well,\" said Clara.\n\n\"And how like her brother she is!\"\n\n\"Yes;--there is a great family likeness.\"\n\n\"And in character, too. I'm sure you'd find, if you were to try her,\nthat she has all his personal firmness, though she can't show it as\nhe does by kicking out his feet and clenching his fist.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like her,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I do like her very much.\"\n\n\"It is so odd,--the way you have changed. You used to speak of him as\nthough he was merely a clod of a farmer, and of her as a stupid old\nmaid. Now, nothing is too good to say of them.\"\n\n\"Exactly, my dear;--and if you do not understand why, you are not so\nclever as I take you to be.\"\n\nLife went on very pleasantly with them at Belton for two or three\nweeks;--but with this drawback as regarded Clara, that she had no\nmeans of knowing what was to be the course of her future life. During\nthese weeks she twice received letters from her cousin Will, and\nanswered both of them. But these letters referred to matters of\nbusiness which entailed no contradiction,--to certain details of\nmoney due to the estate before the old squire's death, and to that\nvexed question of Aunt Winterfield's legacy, which had by this time\ndrifted into Belton's hands, and as to which he was inclined to act\nin accordance with his cousin's wishes, though he was assured by Mr.\nGreen that the legacy was as good a legacy as had ever been left by\nan old woman. \"I think,\" he said in his last letter, \"that we shall\nbe able to throw him over in spite of Mr. Green.\" Clara, as she read\nthis, could not but remember that the man to be thrown over was the\nman to whom she had been engaged, and she could not but remember also\nall the circumstances of the intended legacy,--of her aunt's death,\nand of the scenes which had immediately followed her death. It was so\nodd that William Belton should now be discussing with her the means\nof evading all her aunt's intentions,--and that he should be doing\nso, not as her accepted lover. He had, indeed, called himself her\nbrother, but he was in truth her rejected lover.\n\nFrom time to time during these weeks Mrs. Askerton would ask her\nwhether Mr. Belton was coming to Belton, and Clara would answer her\nwith perfect truth that she did not believe that he had any such\nintention. \"But he must come soon,\" Mrs. Askerton would say. And when\nClara would answer that she knew nothing about it, Mrs. Askerton\nwould ask further questions about Mary Belton. \"Your cousin must know\nwhether her brother is coming to look after the property?\" But Miss\nBelton, though she heard constantly from her brother, gave no such\nintimation. If he had any intention of coming, she did not speak\nof it. During all these days she had not as yet said a word of\nher brother's love. Though his name was daily in her mouth,--and\nlatterly, was frequently mentioned by Clara,--there had been no\nallusion to that still enduring hope of which Will Belton himself\ncould not but speak,--when he had any opportunity of speaking at all.\nAnd this continued till at last Clara was driven to suppose that Mary\nBelton knew nothing of her brother's hopes.\n\nBut at last there came a change,--a change which to Clara was as\ngreat as that which had affected her when she first found that\nher delightful cousin was not safe against love-making. She had\nmade up her mind that the sister did not intend to plead for her\nbrother,--that the sister probably knew nothing of the brother's\nnecessity for pleading,--that the brother probably had no further\nneed for pleading! When she remembered his last passionate words, she\ncould not but accuse herself of hypocrisy when she allowed place in\nher thoughts to this latter supposition. He had been so intently\nearnest! The nature of the man was so eager and true! But yet, in\nspite of all that had been said, of all the fire in his eyes, and\nlife in his words, and energy in his actions, he had at last seen\nthat his aspirations were foolish, and his desires vain. It could not\notherwise be that she and Mary should pass these hours in such calm\nrepose without an allusion to the disturbing subject! After this\nfashion, and with such meditations as these, had passed by the last\nweeks;--and then at last there came the change.\n\n\"I have had a letter from William this morning,\" said Mary.\n\n\"And so have not I,\" said Clara, \"and yet I expect to hear from him.\"\n\n\"He means to be here soon,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\"\n\n\"He speaks of being here next week.\"\n\nFor a moment or two Clara had yielded to the agitation caused by her\ncousin's tidings; but with a little gush she recovered her presence\nof mind, and was able to speak with all the hypothetical propriety of\na female. \"I am glad to hear it,\" she said. \"It is only right that he\nshould come.\"\n\n\"He has asked me to say a word to you,--as to the purport of his\njourney.\"\n\nThen again Clara's courage and hypocrisy were so far subdued that\nthey were not able to maintain her in a position adequate to the\noccasion. \"Well,\" she said laughing, \"what is the word? I hope it is\nnot that I am to pack up, bag and baggage, and take myself elsewhere.\nCousin William is one of those persons who are willing to do\neverything except what they are wanted to do. He will go on talking\nabout the Belton estate, when I want to know whether I may really\nlook for as much as twelve shillings a week to live upon.\"\n\n\"He wants me to speak to you about--about the earnest love he bears\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Oh dear! Mary;--could you not suppose it all to be said? It is an\nold trouble, and need not be repeated.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mary, \"I cannot suppose it to be all said.\" Clara looking\nup as she heard the voice, was astonished both by the fire in the\nwoman's eye and by the force of her tone. \"I will not think so meanly\nof you as to believe that such words from such a man can be passed by\nas meaning nothing. I will not say that you ought to be able to love\nhim; in that you cannot control your heart; but if you cannot love\nhim, the want of such love ought to make you suffer,--to suffer much\nand be very sad.\"\n\n\"I cannot agree to that, Mary.\"\n\n\"Is all his life nothing, then? Do you know what love means with\nhim;--this love which he bears to you? Do you understand that it\nis everything to him?--that from the first moment in which he\nacknowledged to himself that his heart was set upon you, he could not\nbring himself to set it upon any other thing for a moment? Perhaps\nyou have never understood this; have never perceived that he is so\nmuch in earnest, that to him it is more than money, or land, or\nhealth,--more than life itself;--that he so loves that he would\nwillingly give everything that he has for his love? Have you known\nthis?\"\n\nClara would not answer these questions for a while. What if she had\nknown it all, was she therefore bound to sacrifice herself? Could it\nbe the duty of any woman to give herself to a man simply because a\nman wanted her? That was the argument as it was put forward now by\nMary Belton.\n\n\"Dear, dearest Clara,\" said Mary Belton, stretching herself forward\nfrom her chair, and putting out her thin, almost transparent, hand,\n\"I do not think that you have thought enough of this; or, perhaps,\nyou have not known it. But his love for you is as I say. To him it is\neverything. It pervades every hour of every day, every corner in his\nlife! He knows nothing of anything else while he is in his present\nstate.\"\n\n\"He is very good;--more than good.\"\n\n\"He is very good.\"\n\n\"But I do not see that;--that-- Of course I know how disinterested he\nis.\"\n\n\"Disinterested is a poor word. It insinuates that in such a matter\nthere could be a question of what people call interest.\"\n\n\"And I know, too, how much he honours me.\"\n\n\"Honour is a cold word. It is not honour, but love,--downright true,\nhonest love. I hope he does honour you. I believe you to be an\nhonest, true woman; and, as he knows you well, he probably does\nhonour you;--but I am speaking of love.\" Again Clara was silent. She\nknew what should be her argument if she were determined to oppose her\ncousin's pleadings; and she knew also,--she thought she knew,--that\nshe did intend to oppose them; but there was a coldness in the\nargument to which she was averse. \"You cannot be insensible to such\nlove as that!\" said Mary, going on with the cause which she had in\nhand.\n\n\"You say that he is fond of me.\"\n\n\"Fond of you! I have not used such trifling expressions as that.\"\n\n\"That he loves me.\"\n\n\"You know he loves you. Have you ever doubted a word that he has\nspoken to you on any subject?\"\n\n\"I believe he speaks truly.\"\n\n\"You know he speaks truly. He is the very soul of truth.\"\n\n\"But, Mary--\"\n\n\"Well, Clara! But remember; do not answer me lightly. Do not play\nwith a man's heart because you have it in your power.\"\n\n\"You wrong me. I could never do like that. You tell me that he loves\nme;--but what if I do not love him? Love will not be constrained. Am\nI to say that I love him because I believe that he loves me?\"\n\nThis was the argument, and Clara found herself driven to use it,--not\nso much from its special applicability to herself, as on account of\nits general fitness. Whether it did or did not apply to herself she\nhad no time to ask herself at that moment; but she felt that no man\ncould have a right to claim a woman's hand on the strength of his own\nlove,--unless he had been able to win her love. She was arguing on\nbehalf of women in general rather than on her own behalf.\n\n\"If you mean to tell me that you cannot love him, of course I must\ngive over,\" said Mary, not caring at all for men and women in\ngeneral, but full of anxiety for her brother. \"Do you mean to say\nthat,--that you can never love him?\" It almost seemed, from her\nface, that she was determined utterly to quarrel with her new-found\ncousin,--to quarrel and to go at once away if she got an answer that\nwould not please her.\n\n\"Dear Mary, do not press me so hard.\"\n\n\"But I want to press you hard. It is not right that he should lose\nhis life in longing and hoping.\"\n\n\"He will not lose his life, Mary.\"\n\n\"I hope not;--not if I can help it. I trust that he will be strong\nenough to get rid of his trouble,--to put it down and trample it\nunder his feet.\" Clara, as she heard this, began to ask herself what\nit was that was to be trampled under Will's feet. \"I think he will\nbe man enough to overcome his passion; and then, perhaps,--you may\nregret what you have lost.\"\n\n\"Now you are unkind to me.\"\n\n\"Well; what would you have me say? Do I not know that he is offering\nyou the best gift that he can give? Did I not begin by swearing to\nyou that he loved you with a passion of love that cannot but be\nflattering to you? If it is to be love in vain, this to him is a\ngreat misfortune. And, yet, when I say that I hope that he will\nrecover, you tell me that I am unkind.\"\n\n\"No;--not for that.\"\n\n\"May I tell him to come and plead for himself?\"\n\nAgain Clara was silent, not knowing how to answer that last question.\nAnd when she did answer it, she answered it thoughtlessly. \"Of course\nhe knows that he can do that.\"\n\n\"He says that he has been forbidden.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary, what am I to say to you? You know it all, and I wonder\nthat you can continue to question me in this way.\"\n\n\"Know all what?\"\n\n\"That I have been engaged to Captain Aylmer.\"\n\n\"But you are not engaged to him now.\"\n\n\"No--I am not.\"\n\n\"And there can be no renewal there, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Not even for my brother would I say a word if I thought--\"\n\n\"No;--there is nothing of that; but--. If you cannot understand, I do\nnot think that I can explain it.\" It seemed to Clara that her cousin,\nin her anxiety for her brother, did not conceive that a woman,\neven if she could suddenly transfer her affections from one man to\nanother, could not bring herself to say that she had done so.\n\n\"I must write to him to-day,\" said Mary, \"and I must give him some\nanswer. Shall I tell him that he had better not come here till you\nare gone?\"\n\n\"That will perhaps be best,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Then he will never come at all.\"\n\n\"I can go;--can go at once. I will go at once. You shall never have\nto say that my presence prevented his coming to his own house. I\nought not to be here. I know it now. I will go away, and you may tell\nhim that I am gone.\"\n\n\"No, dear; you will not go.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I must go. I fancied things might be otherwise, because he\nonce told me that--he--would--be--a brother to me. And I said I would\nhold him to that;--not only because I want a brother so badly, but\nbecause I love him so dearly. But it cannot be like that.\"\n\n\"You do not think that he will ever desert you?\"\n\n\"But I will go away, so that he may come to his own house. I ought\nnot to be here. Of course I ought not to be at Belton,--either in\nthis house or in any other. Tell him that I will be gone before he\ncan come, and tell him also that I will not be too proud to accept\nfrom him what it may be fit that he should give me. I have no one but\nhim;--no one but him;--no one but him.\" Then she burst into tears,\nand throwing back her head, covered her face with her hands.\n\nMiss Belton, upon this, rose slowly from the chair on which she was\nsitting, and making her way painfully across to Clara, stood leaning\non the weeping girl's chair. \"You shall not go while I am here,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes; I must go. He cannot come till I am gone.\"\n\n\"Think of it all once again, Clara. May I not tell him to come, and\nthat while he is coming you will see if you cannot soften your heart\ntowards him?\"\n\n\"Soften my heart! Oh, if I could only harden it!\"\n\n\"He would wait. If you would only bid him wait, he would be so happy\nin waiting.\"\n\n\"Yes--till to-morrow morning. I know him. Hold out your little finger\nto him, and he has your whole hand and arm in a moment.\"\n\n\"I want you to say that you will try to love him.\"\n\nBut Clara was in truth trying not to love him. She was ashamed of\nherself because she did love the one man, when, but a few weeks\nsince, she had confessed that she loved another. She had mistaken\nherself and her own feelings, not in reference to her cousin, but in\nsupposing that she could really have sympathised with such a man as\nCaptain Aylmer. It was necessary to her self-respect that she should\nbe punished because of that mistake. She could not save herself from\nthis condemnation,--she would not grant herself a respite--because,\nby doing so, she would make another person happy. Had Captain Aylmer\nnever crossed her path, she would have given her whole heart to her\ncousin. Nay; she had so given it,--had done so, although Captain\nAylmer had crossed her path and come in her way. But it was matter of\nshame to her to find that this had been possible, and she could not\nbring herself to confess her shame.\n\nThe conversation at last ended, as such conversations always do end,\nwithout any positive decision. Mary wrote of course to her brother,\nbut Clara was not told of the contents of the letter. We, however,\nmay know them, and may understand their nature, without learning\nabove two lines of the letter. \"If you can be content to wait awhile,\nyou will succeed,\" said Mary; \"but when were you ever content to\nwait for anything?\" \"If there is anything I hate, it is waiting,\"\nsaid Will, when he received the letter; nevertheless the letter made\nhim happy, and he went about his farm with a sanguine heart, as he\narranged matters for another absence. \"Away long?\" he said, in answer\nto a question asked him by his head man; \"how on earth can I say how\nlong I shall be away? You can go on well enough without me by this\ntime, I should think. You will have to learn, for there is no knowing\nhow often I may be away, or for how long.\"\n\nWhen Mary said that the letter had been written, Clara again spoke\nabout going. \"And where will you go?\" said Mary.\n\n\"I will take a lodging in Taunton.\"\n\n\"He would only follow you there, and there would be more trouble.\nThat would be all. He must act as your guardian, and in that\ncapacity, at any rate, you must submit to him.\" Clara, therefore,\nconsented to remain at Belton; but, before Will arrived, she returned\nfrom the house to the cottage.\n\n\"Of course I understand all about it,\" said Mrs. Askerton; \"and let\nme tell you this,--that if it is not all settled within a week from\nhis coming here, I shall think that you are without a heart. He is\nto be knocked about, and cuffed, and kept from his work, and made to\nrun up and down between here and Norfolk, because you cannot bring\nyourself to confess that you have been a fool.\"\n\n\"I have never said that I have not been a fool,\" said Clara.\n\n\"You have made a mistake,--as young women will do sometimes, even\nwhen they are as prudent and circumspect as you are,--and now you\ndon't quite like the task of putting it right.\"\n\nIt was all true, and Clara knew that it was true. The putting right\nof mistakes is never pleasant; and in this case it was so unpleasant\nthat she could not bring herself to acknowledge that it must be done.\nAnd yet, I think, that by this time she was aware of the necessity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTAKING POSSESSION.\n\n\n\"I want her to have it all,\" said William Belton to Mr. Green, the\nlawyer, when they came to discuss the necessary arrangements for the\nproperty.\n\n\"But that would be absurd.\"\n\n\"Never mind. It is what I wish. I suppose a man may do what he likes\nwith his own.\"\n\n\"She won't take it,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"She must take it, if you manage the matter properly,\" said Will.\n\n\"I don't suppose it will make much difference,\" said the\nlawyer,--\"now that Captain Aylmer is out of the running.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that. Of course I am very glad that he should\nbe out of the running, as you call it. He is a bad sort of fellow,\nand I didn't want him to have the property. But all that has had\nnothing to do with it. I'm not doing it because I think she is ever\nto be my wife.\"\n\nFrom this the reader will understand that Belton was still fidgeting\nhimself and the lawyer about the estate when he passed through\nLondon. The matter in dispute, however, was so important that he\nwas induced to seek the advice of others besides Mr. Green, and at\nlast was brought to the conclusion that it was his paramount duty\nto become Belton of Belton. There seemed in the minds of all these\ncouncillors to be some imperative and almost imperious requirement\nthat the acres should go back to a man of his name. Now, as there\nwas no one else of the family who could stand in his way, he had\nno alternative but to become Belton of Belton. He would, however,\nsell his estate in Norfolk, and raise money for endowing Clara with\ncommensurate riches. Such was his own plan;--but having fallen among\ncounsellors he would not exactly follow his own plan, and at last\nsubmitted to an arrangement in accordance with which an annuity of\neight hundred pounds a year was to be settled upon Clara, and this\nwas to lie as a charge upon the estate in Norfolk.\n\n\"It seems to me to be very shabby,\" said William Belton.\n\n\"It seems to me to be very extravagant,\" said the leader among the\ncounsellors. \"She is not entitled to sixpence.\"\n\nBut at last the arrangement as above described was the one to which\nthey all assented.\n\nWhen Belton reached the house which was now his own he found no one\nthere but his sister. Clara was at the cottage. As he had been told\nthat she was to return there, he had no reason to be annoyed. But,\nnevertheless, he was annoyed, or rather discontented, and had not\nbeen a quarter of an hour about the place before he declared his\nintention to go and seek her.\n\n\"Do no such thing, Will; pray do not,\" said his sister.\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Because it will be better that you should wait. You will only injure\nyourself and her by being impetuous.\"\n\n\"But it is absolutely necessary that she should know her own\nposition. It would be cruelty to keep her in ignorance;--though for\nthe matter of that I shall be ashamed to tell her. Yes;--I shall be\nashamed to look her in the face. What will she think of it after I\nhad assured her that she should have the whole?\"\n\n\"But she would not have taken it, Will. And had she done so, she\nwould have been very wrong. Now she will be comfortable.\"\n\n\"I wish I could be comfortable,\" said he.\n\n\"If you will only wait--\"\n\n\"I hate waiting. I do not see what good it will do. Besides, I don't\nmean to say anything about that,--not to-day, at least. I don't\nindeed. As for being here and not seeing her, that is out of the\nquestion. Of course she would think that I had quarrelled with her,\nand that I meant to take everything to myself, now that I have the\npower.\"\n\n\"She won't suspect you of wishing to quarrel with her, Will.\"\n\n\"I should in her place. It is out of the question that I should be\nhere, and not go to her. It would be monstrous. I will wait till they\nhave done lunch, and then I will go up.\"\n\nIt was at last decided that he should walk up to the cottage,\ncall upon Colonel Askerton, and ask to see Clara in the Colonel's\npresence. It was thought that he could make his statement about the\nmoney better before a third person who could be regarded as Clara's\nfriend, than could possibly be done between themselves. He did,\ntherefore, walk across to the cottage, and was shown into Colonel\nAskerton's study.\n\n\"There he is,\" Mrs. Askerton said, as soon as she heard the sound of\nthe bell. \"I knew that he would come at once.\"\n\nDuring the whole morning Mrs. Askerton had been insisting that Belton\nwould make his appearance on that very day,--the day of his arrival\nat Belton, and Clara had been asserting that he would not do so.\n\n\"Why should he come?\" Clara had said.\n\n\"Simply to take you to his own house, like any other of his goods and\nchattels.\"\n\n\"I am not his goods or his chattels.\"\n\n\"But you soon will be; and why shouldn't you accept your lot quietly?\nHe is Belton of Belton, and everything here belongs to him.\"\n\n\"I do not belong to him.\"\n\n\"What nonsense! When a man has the command of the situation, as he\nhas, he can do just what he pleases. If he were to come and carry you\noff by violence, I have no doubt the Beltonians would assist him, and\nsay that he was right. And you of course would forgive him. Belton of\nBelton may do anything.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense, if you please.\"\n\n\"Indeed if you had any of that decent feeling of feminine inferiority\nwhich ought to belong to all women, he would have found you sitting\non the door-step of his house waiting for him.\"\n\nThat had been said early in the morning, when they first knew that he\nhad arrived; but they had been talking about him ever since,--talking\nabout him under pressure from Mrs. Askerton, till Clara had been\ndriven to long that she might be spared. \"If he chooses to come, he\nwill come,\" she said. \"Of course he will come,\" Mrs. Askerton had\nanswered, and then they heard the ring of the bell. \"There he is.\nI could swear to the sound of his foot. Doesn't he step as though\nhe were Belton of Belton, and conscious that everything belonged\nto him?\" Then there was a pause. \"He has been shown in to Colonel\nAskerton. What on earth could he want with him?\"\n\n\"He has called to tell him something about the cottage,\" said Clara,\nendeavouring to speak as though she were calm through it all.\n\n\"Cottage! Fiddlestick! The idea of a man coming to look after his\ntrumpery cottage on the first day of his showing himself as lord of\nhis own property! Perhaps he is demanding that you shall be delivered\nup to him. If he does I shall vote for obeying.\"\n\n\"And I for disobeying,--and shall vote very strongly too.\"\n\nTheir suspense was yet prolonged for another ten minutes, and at the\nend of that time the servant came in and asked if Miss Amedroz would\nbe good enough to go into the master's room. \"Mr. Belton is there,\nFanny?\" asked Mrs. Askerton. The girl confessed that Mr. Belton was\nthere, and then Clara, without another word, got up and left the\nroom. She had much to do in assuming a look of composure before she\nopened the door; but she made the effort, and was not unsuccessful.\nIn another second she found her hand in her cousin's, and his bright\neye was fixed upon her with that eager friendly glance which made his\nface so pleasant to those whom he loved.\n\n\"Your cousin has been telling me of the arrangements he has been\nmaking for you with the lawyers,\" said Colonel Askerton. \"I can only\nsay that I wish all the ladies had cousins so liberal, and so able to\nbe liberal.\"\n\n\"I thought I would see Colonel Askerton first, as you are staying at\nhis house. And as for liberality,--there is nothing of the kind. You\nmust understand, Clara, that a fellow can't do what he likes with\nhis own in this country. I have found myself so bullied by lawyers\nand that sort of people, that I have been obliged to yield to them.\nI wanted that you should have the old place, to do just what you\npleased with it.\"\n\n\"That was out of the question, Will.\"\n\n\"Of course it was,\" said Colonel Askerton. Then, as Belton himself\ndid not proceed to the telling of his own story, the Colonel told\nit for him, and explained what was the income which Clara was to\nreceive.\n\n\"But that is as much out of the question,\" said she, \"as the other. I\ncannot rob you in that way. I cannot and I shall not. And why should\nI? What do I want with an income? Something I ought to have, if only\nfor the credit of the family, and that I am willing to take from your\nkindness; but--\"\n\n\"It's all settled now, Clara.\"\n\n\"I don't think that you can lessen the weight of your obligation,\nMiss Amedroz, after what has been done up in London,\" said the\nColonel.\n\n\"If you had said a hundred a year--\"\n\n\"I have been allowed to say nothing,\" said Belton; \"those people have\nsaid eight,--and so it is settled. When are you coming over to see\nMary?\"\n\nTo this question he got no definite answer, and as he went away\nimmediately afterwards he hardly seemed to expect one. He did not\neven ask for Mrs. Askerton, and as that lady remarked, behaved\naltogether like a bear. \"But what a munificent bear!\" she said.\n\"Fancy;--eight hundred a year of your own. One begins to doubt\nwhether it is worth one's while to marry at all with such an income\nas that to do what one likes with! However, it all means nothing. It\nwill all be his own again before you have even touched it.\"\n\n\"You must not say anything more about that,\" said Clara gravely.\n\n\"And why must I not?\"\n\n\"Because I shall hear nothing more of it. There is an end of all\nthat,--as there ought to be.\"\n\n\"Why an end? I don't see an end. There will be no end till Belton\nof Belton has got you and your eight hundred a year as well as\neverything else.\"\n\n\"You will find that--he--does not mean--anything--more,\" said Clara.\n\n\"You think not?\"\n\n\"I am--sure of it.\" Then there was a little sound in her throat\nas though she were in some danger of being choked; but she soon\nrecovered herself, and was able to express herself clearly. \"I have\nonly one favour to ask you now, Mrs. Askerton, and that is that you\nwill never say anything more about him. He has changed his mind. Of\ncourse he has, or he would not come here like that and have gone away\nwithout saying a word.\"\n\n\"Not a word! A man gives you eight hundred a year, and that is not\nsaying a word!\"\n\n\"Not a word except about money! But of course he is right. I know\nthat he is right. After what has passed he would be very wrong\nto--to--think about it any more. You joke about his being Belton of\nBelton. But it does make a difference.\"\n\n\"It does;--does it?\"\n\n\"It has made a difference. I see and feel it now. I shall never--hear\nhim--ask me--that question--any more.\"\n\n\"And if you did hear him, what answer would you make him?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"That is just it. Women are so cross-grained that it is a wonder to\nme that men should ever have anything to do with them. They have\nabout them some madness of a phantasy which they dignify with the\nname of feminine pride, and under the cloak of this they believe\nthemselves to be justified in tormenting their lovers' lives out.\nThe only consolation is that they torment themselves as much. Can\nanything be more cross-grained than you are at this moment? You were\nresolved just now that it would be the most unbecoming thing in the\nworld if he spoke a word more about his love for the next twelve\nmonths--\"\n\n\"Mrs. Askerton, I said nothing about twelve months.\"\n\n\"And now you are broken-hearted because he did not blurt it all out\nbefore Colonel Askerton in a business interview, which was very\nproperly had at once, and in which he has had the exceeding good\ntaste to confine himself altogether to the one subject.\"\n\n\"I am not complaining.\"\n\n\"It was good taste; though if he had not been a bear he might have\nasked after me, who am fighting his battles for him night and day.\"\n\n\"But what will he do next?\"\n\n\"Eat his dinner, I should think, as it is now nearly five o'clock.\nYour father used always to dine at five.\"\n\n\"I can't go to see Mary,\" she said, \"till he comes here again.\"\n\n\"He will be here fast enough. I shouldn't wonder if he was to come\nhere to-night.\" And he did come again that night.\n\nWhen Belton's interview was over in the Colonel's study, he left the\nhouse,--without even asking after the mistress, as that mistress had\ntaken care to find out,--and went off, rambling about the estate\nwhich was now his own. It was a beautiful place, and he was not\ninsensible to the gratification of being its owner. There is much\nin the glory of ownership,--of the ownership of land and houses, of\nbeeves and woolly flocks, of wide fields and thick-growing woods,\neven when that ownership is of late date, when it conveys to the\nowner nothing but the realisation of a property on the soil; but\nthere is much more in it when it contains the memories of old years;\nwhen the glory is the glory of race as well as the glory of power\nand property. There had been Beltons of Belton living there for\nmany centuries, and now he was the Belton of the day, standing on\nhis own ground,--the descendant and representative of the Beltons\nof old,--Belton of Belton without a flaw in his pedigree! He felt\nhimself to be proud of his position,--prouder than he could have been\nof any other that might have been vouchsafed to him. And yet amidst\nit all he was somewhat ashamed of his pride. \"The man who can do it\nfor himself is the real man after all,\" he said. \"But I have got\nit by a fluke,--and by such a sad chance too!\" Then he wandered on,\nthinking of the circumstances under which the property had fallen\ninto his hands, and remembering how and when and where the first idea\nhad occurred to him of making Clara Amedroz his wife. He had then\nfelt that if he could only do that he could reconcile himself to the\nheirship. And the idea had grown upon him instantly, and had become a\npassion by the eagerness with which he had welcomed it. From that day\nto this he had continued to tell himself that he could not enjoy his\ngood fortune unless he could enjoy it with her. There had come to be\na horrid impediment in his way,--a barrier which had seemed to have\nbeen placed there by his evil fortune, to compensate the gifts given\nto him by his good fortune, and that barrier had been Captain Aylmer.\nHe had not, in fact, seen much of his rival, but he had seen enough\nto make it matter of wonder to him that Clara could be attached to\nsuch a man. He had thoroughly despised Captain Aylmer, and had longed\nto show his contempt of the man by kicking him out of the hotel at\nthe London railway station. At that moment all the world had seemed\nto him to be wrong and wretched.\n\nBut now it seemed that all the world might so easily be made right\nagain! The impediment had got itself removed. Belton did not even yet\naltogether comprehend by what means Clara had escaped from the meshes\nof the Aylmer Park people, but he did know that she had escaped.\nHer eyes had been opened before it was too late, and she was a free\nwoman,--to be compassed if only a man might compass her. While\nshe had been engaged to Captain Aylmer, Will had felt that she\nwas not assailable. Though he had not been quite able to restrain\nhimself,--as on that fatal occasion when he had taken her in his arms\nand kissed her,--still he had known that as she was an engaged woman,\nhe could not, without insulting her, press his own suit upon her. But\nnow all that was over. Let him say what he liked on that head, she\nwould have no proper plea for anger. She was assailable;--and, as\nthis was so, why the mischief should he not set about the work at\nonce? His sister bade him to wait. Why should he wait when one\nfortunate word might do it? Wait! He could not wait. How are you to\nbid a starving man to wait when you put him down at a well-covered\nboard? Here was he, walking about Belton Park,--just where she used\nto walk with him;--and there was she at Belton Cottage, within half\nan hour of him at this moment, if he were to go quickly; and yet Mary\nwas telling him to wait! No; he would not wait. There could be no\nreason for waiting. Wait, indeed, till some other Captain Aylmer\nshould come in the way and give him more trouble!\n\nSo he wandered on, resolving that he would see his cousin again\nthat very day. Such an interview as that which had just taken place\nbetween two such dear friends was not natural,--was not to be\nendured. What might not Clara think of it! To meet her for the first\ntime after her escape from Aylmer Park, and to speak to her only\non matters concerning money! He would certainly go to her again on\nthat afternoon. In his walking he came to the bottom of the rising\nground on the top of which stood the rock on which he and Clara had\ntwice sat. But he turned away, and would not go up to it. He hoped\nthat he might go up to it very soon,--but, except under certain\ncircumstances, he would never go up to it again.\n\n\"I am going across to the cottage immediately after dinner,\" he said\nto his sister.\n\n\"Have you an appointment?\"\n\n\"No; I have no appointment. I suppose a man doesn't want an\nappointment to go and see his own cousin down in the country.\"\n\n\"I don't know what their habits are.\"\n\n\"I shan't ask to go in; but I want to see her.\"\n\nMary looked at him with loving, sorrowing eyes, but she said no more.\nShe loved him so well that she would have given her right hand to get\nfor him what he wanted;--but she sorrowed to think that he should\nwant such a thing so sorely. Immediately after his dinner, he took\nhis hat and went out without saying a word further, and made his way\nonce more across to the gate of the cottage. It was a lovely summer\nevening, at that period of the year in which our summer evenings just\nbegin, when the air is sweeter and the flowers more fragrant, and the\nforms of the foliage more lovely than at any other time. It was now\neight o'clock, but it was hardly as yet evening; none at least of the\ngloom of evening had come, though the sun was low in the heavens. At\nthe cottage they were all sitting out on the lawn; and as Belton came\nnear he was seen by them, and he saw them.\n\n\"I told you so,\" said Mrs. Askerton, to Clara, in a whisper.\n\n\"He is not coming in,\" Clara answered. \"He is going on.\"\n\nBut when he had come nearer, Colonel Askerton called to him over the\ngarden paling, and asked him to join them. He was now standing within\nten or fifteen yards of them, though the fence divided them. \"I have\ncome to ask my cousin Clara to take a walk with me,\" he said. \"She\ncan be back by your tea time.\" He made his request very placidly, and\ndid not in any way look like a lover.\n\n\"I am sure she will be glad to go,\" said Mrs. Askerton. But Clara\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"Do take a turn with me, if you are not tired,\" said he.\n\n\"She has not been out all day, and cannot be tired,\" said Mrs.\nAskerton, who had now walked up to the paling. \"Clara, get your hat.\nBut, Mr. Belton, what have I done that I am to be treated in this\nway? Perhaps you don't remember that you have not spoken to me since\nyour arrival.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I beg your pardon,\" said he, endeavouring to stretch\nhis hand across the bushes. \"I forgot I didn't see you this morning.\"\n\n\"I suppose I mustn't be angry, as this is your day of taking\npossession; but it is exactly on such days as this that one likes to\nbe remembered.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to forget you, Mrs. Askerton; I didn't, indeed. And\nas for the special day, that's all bosh, you know. I haven't taken\nparticular possession of anything that I know of.\"\n\n\"I hope you will, Mr. Belton, before the day is over,\" said she.\nClara had at length arisen, and had gone into the house to fetch her\nhat. She had not spoken a word, and even yet her cousin did not know\nwhether she was coming. \"I hope you will take possession of a great\ndeal that is very valuable. Clara has gone to get her hat.\"\n\n\"Do you think she means to walk?\"\n\n\"I think she does, Mr. Belton. And there she is at the door. Mind you\nbring her back to tea.\"\n\nClara, as she came forth, felt herself quite unable to speak, or\nwalk, or look after her usual manner. She knew herself to be a\nvictim,--to be so far a victim that she could no longer control her\nown fate. To Captain Aylmer, at any rate, she had never succumbed.\nIn all her dealings with him she had fought upon an equal footing.\nShe had never been compelled to own herself mastered. But now she\nwas being led out that she might confess her own submission, and\nacknowledge that hitherto she had not known what was good for her.\nShe knew that she would have to yield. She must have known how happy\nshe was to have an opportunity of yielding; but yet,--yet, had there\nbeen any room for choice, she thought she would have refrained from\nwalking with her cousin that evening. She had wept that afternoon\nbecause she had thought that he would not come again; and now that\nhe had come at the first moment that was possible for him, she was\nalmost tempted to wish him once more away.\n\n\"I suppose you understand that when I came up this morning I came\nmerely to talk about business,\" said Belton, as soon as they were off\ntogether.\n\n\"It was very good of you to come at all so soon after your arrival.\"\n\n\"I told those people in London that I would have it all settled at\nonce, and so I wanted to have it off my mind.\"\n\n\"I don't know what I ought to say to you. Of course I shall not want\nso much money as that.\"\n\n\"We won't talk about the money any more to-day. I hate talking about\nmoney.\"\n\n\"It is not the pleasantest subject in the world.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he; \"no indeed. I hate it,--particularly between friends.\nSo you have come to grief with your friends, the Aylmers?\"\n\n\"I hope I haven't come to grief,--and the Aylmers, as a family, never\nwere my friends. I'm obliged to contradict you, point by point,--you\nsee.\"\n\n\"I don't like Captain Aylmer at all,\" said Will, after a pause.\n\n\"So I saw Will; and I dare say he was not very fond of you.\"\n\n\"Fond of me! I didn't want him to be fond of me. I don't suppose he\never thought much about me. I could not help thinking of him.\"--She\nhad nothing to say to this, and therefore walked on silently by his\nside. \"I suppose he has not any idea of coming back here again?\"\n\n\"What; to Belton? No, I do not think he will come to Belton any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Nor will you go to Aylmer Park?\"\n\n\"No; certainly not. Of all the places on earth, Will, to which you\ncould send me, Aylmer Park is the one to which I should go most\nunwillingly.\"\n\n\"I don't want to send you there.\"\n\n\"You never could be made to understand what a woman she is; how\ndisagreeable, how cruel, how imperious, how insolent.\"\n\n\"Was she so bad as all that?\"\n\n\"Indeed she was, Will. I can't but tell the truth to you.\"\n\n\"And he was nearly as bad as she.\"\n\n\"No, Will; no; do not say that of him.\"\n\n\"He was such a quarrelsome fellow. He flew at me just because I said\nwe had good hunting down in Norfolk.\"\n\n\"We need not talk about all that, Will.\"\n\n\"No;--of course not. It's all passed and gone, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes;--it is all passed and gone. You did not know my Aunt\nWinterfield, or you would understand my first reason for liking him.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Will; \"I never saw her.\"\n\nThen they walked on together for a while without speaking, and Clara\nwas beginning to feel some relief,--some relief at first; but as\nthe relief came, there came back to her the dead, dull, feeling of\nheaviness at her heart which had oppressed her after his visit in the\nmorning. She had been right, and Mrs. Askerton had been wrong. He had\nreturned to her simply as her cousin, and now he was walking with her\nand talking to her in this strain, to teach her that it was so. But\nof a sudden they came to a place where two paths diverged, and he\nturned upon her and asked her quickly which path they should take.\n\"Look, Clara,\" he said, \"will you go up there with me?\" It did not\nneed that she should look, as she knew that the way indicated by him\nled up among the rocks.\n\n\"I don't much care which way,\" she said, faintly.\n\n\"Do you not? But I do. I care very much. Don't you remember where\nthat path goes?\" She had no answer to give to this. She remembered\nwell, and remembered how he had protested that he would never go to\nthe place again unless he could go there as her accepted lover. And\nshe had asked herself sundry questions as to that protestation. Could\nit be that for her sake he would abstain from visiting the prettiest\nspot on his estate,--that he would continue to regard the ground as\nhallowed because of his memories of her? \"Which way shall we go?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"I suppose it does not much signify,\" said she, trembling.\n\n\"But it does signify. It signifies very much to me. Will you go up to\nthe rocks?\"\n\n\"I am afraid we shall be late, if we stay out long.\"\n\n\"What matters how late? Will you come?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,--if you wish it, Will.\"\n\nShe had anticipated that the high rock was to be the altar at which\nthe victim was to be sacrificed; but now he would not wait till he\nhad taken her to the sacred spot. He had of course intended that he\nwould there renew his offer; but he had perceived that his offer had\nbeen renewed, and had, in fact, been accepted, during this little\nparley as to the pathway. There was hardly any necessity for further\nwords. So he must have thought; for, as quick as lightning, he flung\nhis arms around her, and kissed her again, as he had kissed her on\nthat other terrible occasion,--that occasion on which he had felt\nthat he might hardly hope for pardon.\n\n\"William, William,\" she said; \"how can you serve me like that?\" But\nhe had a full understanding as to his own privileges, and was well\naware that he was in the right now, as he had been before that he was\ntrespassing egregiously. \"Why are you so rough with me?\" she said.\n\n\"Clara, say that you love me.\"\n\n\"I will say nothing to you because you are so rough.\"\n\nThey were now walking up slowly towards the rocks. And as he had his\narm round her waist, he was contented for awhile to allow her to walk\nwithout speaking. But when they were on the summit it was necessary\nfor him that he should have a word from her of positive assurance.\n\"Clara, say that you love me.\"\n\n\"Have I not always loved you, Will, since almost the first moment\nthat I saw you?\"\n\n\"But that won't do. You know that is not fair. Come, Clara; I've had\na deal of trouble,--and grief too; haven't I? You should say a word\nto make up for it;--that is, if you can say it.\"\n\n\"What can a word like that signify to you to-day? You have got\neverything.\"\n\n\"Have I got you?\" Still she paused. \"I will have an answer. Have I\ngot you? Are you now my own?\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Will. Don't now. I will not have it again. Does not\nthat satisfy you?\"\n\n\"Tell me that you love me.\"\n\n\"You know that I love you.\"\n\n\"Better than anybody in the world?\"\n\n\"Yes;--better than anybody in the world.\"\n\n\"And after all you will be--my wife?\"\n\n\"Oh, Will,--how you question one!\"\n\n\"You shall say it, and then it will all be fair and honest.\"\n\n\"Say what? I'm sure I thought I had said everything.\"\n\n\"Say that you mean to be my wife.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,--if you wish it.\"\n\n\"Wish it!\" said he, getting up from his seat, and throwing his hat\ninto the bushes on one side; \"wish it! I don't think you have ever\nunderstood how I have wished it. Look here, Clara; I found when I got\ndown to Norfolk that I couldn't live without you. Upon my word it is\ntrue. I don't suppose you'll believe me.\"\n\n\"I didn't think it could be so bad with you as that.\"\n\n\"No;--I don't suppose women ever do believe. And I wouldn't have\nbelieved it of myself. I hated myself for it. By George, I did. That\nis when I began to think it was all up with me.\"\n\n\"All up with you! Oh, Will!\"\n\n\"I had quite made up my mind to go to New Zealand. I had, indeed. I\ncouldn't have kept my hands off that man if we had been living in the\nsame country. I should have wrung his neck.\"\n\n\"Will, how can you talk so wickedly?\"\n\n\"There's no understanding it till you have felt it. But never mind.\nIt's all right now; isn't it, Clara?\"\n\n\"If you think so.\"\n\n\"Think so! Oh, Clara, I am such a happy fellow. Do give me a kiss.\nYou have never given me one kiss yet.\"\n\n\"What nonsense! I didn't think you were such a baby.\"\n\n\"By George, but you shall;--or you shall never get home to tea\nto-night. My own, own, own darling. Upon my word, Clara, when I begin\nto think about it I shall be half mad.\"\n\n\"I think you are quite that already.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not;--but I shall be when I'm alone. What can I say to you,\nClara, to make you understand how much I love you? You remember the\nsong, 'For Bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down and dee.' Of course\nit is all nonsense talking of dying for a woman. What a man has to\ndo is to live for her. But that is my feeling. I'm ready to give you\nmy life. If there was anything to do for you, I'd do it if I could,\nwhatever it was. Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"Dear Will! Dearest Will!\"\n\n\"Am I dearest?\"\n\n\"Are you not sure of it?\"\n\n\"But I like you to tell me so. I like to feel that you are not\nashamed to own it. You ought to say it a few times to me, as I have\nsaid it so very often to you.\"\n\n\"You'll hear enough of it before you've done with me.\"\n\n\"I shall never have heard enough of it. Oh, Heavens, only think, when\nI was coming down in the train last night I was in such a bad way.\"\n\n\"And are you in a good way now?\"\n\n\"Yes; in a very good way. I shall crow over Mary so when I get home.\"\n\n\"And what has poor Mary done?\"\n\n\"Never mind.\"\n\n\"I dare say she knows what is good for you better than you know\nyourself. I suppose she has told you that you might do a great deal\nbetter than trouble yourself with a wife?\"\n\n\"Never mind what she has told me. It is settled now;--is it not?\"\n\n\"I hope so, Will.\"\n\n\"But not quite settled as yet. When shall it be? That is the next\nquestion.\"\n\nBut to that question Clara positively refused to make any reply that\nher lover would consider to be satisfactory. He continued to press\nher till she was at last driven to remind him how very short a time\nit was since her father had been among them; and then he was very\nangry with himself, and declared himself to be a brute. \"Anything but\nthat,\" she said. \"You are the kindest and the best of men;--but at\nthe same time the most impatient.\"\n\n\"That's what Mary says; but what's the good of waiting? She wanted me\nto wait to-day.\"\n\n\"And as you would not, you have fallen into a trap out of which you\ncan never escape. But pray let us go. What will they think of us?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if they didn't think something near the truth.\"\n\n\"Whatever they think, we will go back. It is ever so much past nine.\"\n\n\"Before you stir, Clara, tell me one thing. Are you really happy?\"\n\n\"Very happy.\"\n\n\"And are you glad that this has been done?\"\n\n\"Very glad. Will that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"And you do love me?\"\n\n\"I do--I do--I do. Can I say more than that?\"\n\n\"More than anybody else in the world?\"\n\n\"Better than all the world put together.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said he, holding her tight in his arms, \"show me that you\nlove me.\" And as he made his request he was quick to explain to her\nwhat, according to his ideas, was the becoming mode by which lovers\nmight show their love. I wonder whether it ever occurred to Clara, as\nshe thought of it all before she went to bed that night, that Captain\nAylmer and William Belton were very different in their manners. And\nif so, I must wonder further whether she most approved the manners of\nthe patient man or the man who was impatient.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nAbout two months after the scene described in the last chapter, when\nthe full summer had arrived, Clara received two letters from the two\nlovers, the history of whose loves have just been told, and these\nshall be submitted to the reader, as they will serve to explain the\nmanner in which the two men proposed to arrange their affairs. We\nwill first have Captain Aylmer's letter, which was the first read;\nClara kept the latter for the last, as children always keep their\nsweetest morsels.\n\n\n   Aylmer Park, August, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR MISS AMEDROZ,\n\n   I heard before leaving London that you are engaged to\n   marry your cousin Mr. William Belton, and I think that\n   perhaps you may be satisfied to have a line from me to let\n   you know that I quite approve of the marriage.\n\n\"I do not care very much for his approval or disapproval,\" said Clara\nas she read this.\n\n   No doubt it will be the best thing you can do, especially\n   as it will heal all the sores arising from the entail.\n\n\"There never was any sore,\" said Clara.\n\n   Pray give my compliments to Mr. Belton, and offer him\n   my congratulations, and tell him that I wish him all\n   happiness in the married state.\n\n\"Married fiddlestick!\" said Clara. In this she was unreasonable;\nbut the euphonious platitudes of Captain Aylmer were so unlike the\nvehement protestations of Mr. Belton that she must be excused if by\nthis time she had come to entertain something of an unreasonable\naversion for the former.\n\n   I hope you will not receive my news with perfect\n   indifference when I tell you that I also am going to be\n   married. The lady is one whom I have known for a long\n   time, and have always esteemed very highly. She is Lady\n   Emily Tagmaggert, the youngest daughter of the Earl of\n   Mull.\n\nWhy Clara should immediately have conceived a feeling of supreme\ncontempt for Lady Emily Tagmaggert, and assured herself that\nher ladyship was a thin, dry, cross old maid with a red nose, I\ncannot explain; but I do know that such were her thoughts, almost\ninstantaneously, in reference to Captain Aylmer's future bride.\n\n   Lady Emily is a very intimate friend of my sister's; and\n   you, who know how our family cling together, will feel how\n   thankful I must be when I tell you that my mother quite\n   approves of the engagement. I suppose we shall be married\n   early in the spring. We shall probably spend some months\n   every year at Perivale, and I hope that we may look\n   forward to the pleasure of seeing you sometimes as a guest\n   beneath our roof.\n\nOn reading this Clara shuddered, and made some inward protestation\nwhich seemed to imply that she had no wish whatever to revisit the\ndull streets of the little town with which she had been so well\nacquainted. \"I hope she'll be good to poor Mr. Possit,\" said Clara,\n\"and give him port wine on Sundays.\"\n\n   I have one more thing that I ought to say. You will\n   remember that I intended to pay my aunt's legacy\n   immediately after her death, but that I was prevented\n   by circumstances which I could not control. I have paid\n   it now into Mr. Green's hands on your account, together\n   with the sum of \u00c2\u00a359 18_s._ 3_d._, which is due upon it as\n   interest at the rate of five per cent. I hope that this\n   may be satisfactory.\n\n\"It is not satisfactory at all,\" said Clara, putting down the letter,\nand resolving that Will Belton should be instructed to repay the\nmoney instantly. It may, however, be explained here that in this\nmatter Clara was doomed to be disappointed; and that she was forced,\nby Mr. Green's arguments, to receive the money. \"Then it shall go to\nthe hospital at Perivale,\" she declared when those arguments were\nused. As to that, Mr. Green was quite indifferent, but I do not think\nthat the legacy which troubled poor Aunt Winterfield so much on her\ndying bed was ultimately applied to so worthy a purpose.\n\n\"And now, my dear Miss Amedroz,\" continued the letter,\n\n   I will say farewell, with many assurances of my unaltered\n   esteem, and with heartfelt wishes for your future\n   happiness. Believe me to be always,\n\n   Most faithfully and sincerely yours,\n\n   FREDERIC F. AYLMER.\n\n\n\"Esteem!\" said Clara, as she finished the letter. \"I wonder which\nhe esteems the most, me or Lady Emily Tagmaggert. He will never get\nbeyond esteem with any one.\"\n\nThe letter which was last read was as follows:--\n\n\n   Plaistow, August, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST CLARA,\n\n   I don't think I shall ever get done, and I am coming to\n   hate farming. It is awful lonely here, too, and I pass all\n   my evenings by myself, wondering why I should be doomed\n   to this kind of thing, while you and Mary are comfortable\n   together at Belton. We have begun with the wheat, and as\n   soon as that is safe I shall cut and run. I shall leave\n   the barley to Bunce. Bunce knows as much about it as I\n   do,--and as for remaining here all the summer, it's out of\n   the question.\n\n   My own dear, darling love, of course I don't intend to\n   urge you to do anything that you don't like; but upon my\n   honour I don't see the force of what you say. You know I\n   have as much respect for your father's memory as anybody,\n   but what harm can it do to him that we should be married\n   at once? Don't you think he would have wished it himself?\n   It can be ever so quiet. So long as it's done, I don't\n   care a straw how it's done. Indeed, for the matter of\n   that, I always think it would be best just to walk to\n   church and to walk home again without saying anything to\n   anybody. I hate fuss and nonsense, and really I don't\n   think anybody would have a right to say anything if we\n   were to do it at once in that sort of way. I have had a\n   bad time of it for the last twelvemonth. You must allow\n   that, and I think that I ought to be rewarded.\n\n   As for living, you shall have your choice. Indeed you\n   shall live anywhere you please;--at Timbuctoo if you like\n   it. I don't want to give up Plaistow, because my father\n   and grandfather farmed the land themselves; but I am quite\n   prepared not to live here. I don't think it would suit\n   you, because it has so much of the farm-house about it.\n   Only I should like you sometimes to come and look at the\n   old place. What I should like would be to pull down the\n   house at Belton and build another. But you mustn't propose\n   to put it off till that's done, as I should never have the\n   heart to do it. If you think that would suit you, I'll\n   make up my mind to live at Belton for a constancy; and\n   then I'd go in for a lot of cattle, and don't doubt I'd\n   make a fortune. I'm almost sick of looking at the straight\n   ridges in the big square fields every day of my life.\n\n   Give my love to Mary. I hope she fights my battle for me.\n   Pray think of all this, and relent if you can. I do so\n   long to have an end of this purgatory. If there was any\n   use, I wouldn't say a word; but there's no good in being\n   tortured, when there is no use. God bless you, dearest\n   love. I do love you so well!\n\n   Yours most affectionately,\n\n   W. BELTON.\n\n\nShe kissed the letter twice, pressed it to her bosom, and then sat\nsilent for half an hour thinking of it;--of it, and the man who wrote\nit, and of the man who had written the other letter. She could not\nbut remember how that other man had thought to treat her, when it was\nhis intention and her intention that they two should join their lots\ntogether;--how cold he had been; how full of caution and counsel; how\nhe had preached to her himself and threatened her with the preaching\nof his mother; how manifestly he had purposed to make her life a\nsacrifice to his life; how he had premeditated her incarceration at\nPerivale, while he should be living a bachelor's life in London! Will\nBelton's ideas of married life were very different. Only come to me\nat once,--now, immediately, and everything else shall be disposed\njust as you please. This was his offer. What he proposed to give,--or\nrather his willingness to be thus generous, was very sweet to her;\nbut it was not half so sweet as his impatience in demanding his\nreward. How she doted on him because he considered his present state\nto be a purgatory! How could she refuse anything she could give to\none who desired her gifts so strongly?\n\nAs for her future residence, it would be a matter of indifference to\nher where she should live, so long as she might live with him; but\nfor him,--she felt that but one spot in the world was fit for him.\nHe was Belton of Belton, and it would not be becoming that he should\nlive elsewhere. Of course she would go with him to Plaistow Hall as\noften as he might wish it; but Belton Castle should be his permanent\nresting-place. It would be her duty to be proud for him, and\ntherefore, for his sake, she would beg that their home might be in\nSomersetshire.\n\n\"Mary,\" she said to her cousin soon afterwards, \"Will sends his love\nto you.\"\n\n\"And what else does he say?\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you everything. You shouldn't expect it.\"\n\n\"I don't expect it; but perhaps there may be something to be told.\"\n\n\"Nothing that I need tell,--specially. You, who know him so well, can\nimagine what he would say.\"\n\n\"Dear Will! I am sure he would mean to write what was pleasant.\"\n\nThen the matter would have dropped had Clara been so minded,--but\nshe, in truth, was anxious to be forced to talk about the letter.\nShe wished to be urged by Mary to do that which Will urged her to\ndo;--or, at least, to learn whether Mary thought that her brother's\nwish might be gratified without impropriety. \"Don't you think we\nought to live here?\" she said.\n\n\"By all means,--if you both like it.\"\n\n\"He is so good,--so unselfish, that he will only ask me to do what\nI like best.\"\n\n\"And which would you like best?\"\n\n\"I think he ought to live here because it is the old family property.\nI confess that the name goes for something with me. He says that he\nwould build a new house.\"\n\n\"Does he think he could have it ready by the time you are married?\"\n\n\"Ah;--that is just the difficulty. Perhaps, after all, you had\nbetter read his letter. I don't know why I should not show it to\nyou. It will only tell you what you know already,--that he is the\nmost generous fellow in all the world.\" Then Mary read the letter.\n\"What am I to say to him?\" Clara asked. \"It seems so hard to refuse\nanything to one who is so true, and good, and generous.\"\n\n\"It is hard.\"\n\n\"But you see my poor, dear father's death has been so recent.\"\n\n\"I hardly know,\" said Mary, \"how the world feels about such things.\"\n\n\"I think we ought to wait at least twelve months,\" said Clara, very\nsadly.\n\n\"Poor Will! He will be broken-hearted a dozen times before that. But\nthen, when his happiness does come, he will be all the happier.\"\nClara, when she heard this, almost hated her cousin Mary,--not for\nher own sake, but on Will's account. Will trusted so implicitly to\nhis sister, and yet she could not make a better fight for him than\nthis! It almost seemed that Mary was indifferent to her brother's\nhappiness. Had Will been her brother, Clara thought, and had any girl\nasked her advice under similar circumstances, she was sure that she\nwould have answered in a different way. She would have told such girl\nthat her first duty was owing to the man who was to be her husband,\nand would not have said a word to her about the feeling of the world.\nAfter all, what did the feeling of the world signify to them, who\nwere going to be all the world to each other?\n\nOn that afternoon she went up to Mrs. Askerton's; and succeeded in\ngetting advice from her also, though she did not show Will's letter\nto that lady. \"Of course, I know what he says,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\"Unless I have mistaken the man, he wants to be married to-morrow.\"\n\n\"He is not so bad as that,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Then the next day, or the day after. Of course he is impatient, and\ndoes not see any earthly reason why his impatience should not be\ngratified.\"\n\n\"He is impatient.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you hesitate because of your father's death.\"\n\n\"It seems but the other day;--does it not?\" said Clara.\n\n\"Everything seems but the other day to me. It was but the other day\nthat I myself was married.\"\n\n\"And, of course, though I would do anything I could that he would ask\nme to do--\"\n\n\"But would you do anything?\"\n\n\"Anything that was not wrong I would. Why should I not, when he is so\ngood to me?\"\n\n\"Then write to him, my dear, and tell him that it shall be as\nhe wishes it. Believe me, the days of Jacob are over. Men don't\nunderstand waiting now, and it's always as well to catch your fish\nwhen you can.\"\n\n\"You don't suppose I have any thought of that kind?\"\n\n\"I am sure you have not;--and I'm sure that he deserves no such\nthought;--but the higher that are his deserts, the greater should be\nhis reward. If I were you, I should think of nothing but him, and I\nshould do exactly as he would have me.\" Clara kissed her friend as\nshe parted from her, and again resolved that all that woman's sins\nshould be forgiven her. A woman who could give such excellent advice\ndeserved that every sin should be forgiven her. \"They'll be married\nyet before the summer is over,\" Mrs. Askerton said to her husband\nthat afternoon. \"I believe a man may have anything he chooses to ask\nfor, if he'll only ask hard enough.\"\n\nAnd they were married in the autumn, if not actually in the summer.\nWith what precise words Clara answered her lover's letter I will\nnot say; but her answer was of such a nature that he found himself\ncompelled to leave Plaistow, even before the wheat was garnered.\nGreat confidence was placed in Bunce on that occasion, and I have\nreason to believe that it was not misplaced. They were married in\nSeptember;--yes, in September, although that letter of Will's was\nwritten in August, and by the beginning of October they had returned\nfrom their wedding trip to Plaistow. Clara insisted that she should\nbe taken to Plaistow, and was very anxious when there to learn all\nthe particulars of the farm. She put down in a little book how many\nacres there were in each field, and what was the average produce of\nthe land. She made inquiry about four-crop rotation, and endeavoured,\nwith Bunce, to go into the great subject of stall-feeding. But Belton\ndid not give her as much encouragement as he might have done. \"We'll\ncome here for the shooting next year,\" he said; \"that is, if there is\nnothing to prevent us.\"\n\n\"I hope there'll be nothing to prevent us.\"\n\n\"There might be, perhaps; but we'll always come if there is not. For\nthe rest of it, I'll leave it to Bunce, and just run over once or\ntwice in the year. It would not be a nice place for you to live at\nlong.\"\n\n\"I like it of all things. I am quite interested about the farm.\"\n\n\"You'd get very sick of it if you were here in the winter. The truth\nis that if you farm well, you must farm ugly. The picturesque nooks\nand corners have all to be turned inside out, and the hedgerows must\nbe abolished, because we want the sunshine. Now, down at Belton, just\nabout the house, we won't mind farming well, but will stick to the\npicturesque.\"\n\nThe new house was immediately commenced at Belton, and was made\nto proceed with all imaginable alacrity. It was supposed at one\ntime,--at least Belton himself said that he so supposed,--that the\nbuilding would be ready for occupation at the end of the first\nsummer; but this was not found to be possible. \"We must put it off\ntill May, after all,\" said Belton, as he was walking round the\nunfinished building with Colonel Askerton. \"It's an awful bore, but\nthere's no getting people really to pull out in this country.\"\n\n\"I think they've pulled out pretty well. Of course you couldn't have\ngone into a damp house for the winter.\"\n\n\"Other people can get a house built within twelve months. Look what\nthey do in London.\"\n\n\"And other people with their wives and children die in consequence of\ncolds and sore throats and other evils of that nature. I wouldn't go\ninto a new house, I know, till I was quite sure it was dry.\"\n\nAs Will at this time was hardly ten months married, he was not as\nyet justified in thinking about his own wife and children; but he\nhad already found it expedient to make arrangements for the autumn,\nwhich would prevent that annual visit to Plaistow which Clara had\ncontemplated, and which he had regarded with his characteristic\nprudence as being subject to possible impediments. He was to be\nabsent himself for the first week in September, but was to return\nimmediately after that. This he did; and before the end of that\nmonth he was justified in talking of his wife and family. \"I suppose\nit wouldn't have done to have been moving now,--under all the\ncircumstances,\" he said to his friend, Mrs. Askerton, as he still\ngrumbled about the unfinished house.\n\n\"I don't think it would have done at all, under all the\ncircumstances,\" said Mrs. Askerton.\n\nBut in the following spring or early summer they did get into the new\nhouse;--and a very nice house it was, as will, I think, be believed\nby those who have known Mr. William Belton. And when they were well\nsettled, at which time little Will Belton was some seven or eight\nmonths old,--little Will, for whom great bonfires had been lit, as\nthough his birth in those parts was a matter not to be regarded\nlightly; for was he not the first Belton of Belton who had been born\nthere for more than a century?--when that time came visitors appeared\nat the new Belton Castle, visitors of importance, who were entitled\nto, and who received, great consideration. These were no less than\nCaptain Aylmer, member for Perivale, and his newly-married bride,\nLady Emily Aylmer, _n\u00c3\u00a9e_ Tagmaggert. They were then just married,\nand had come down to Belton Castle immediately after their honeymoon\ntrip. How it had come to pass that such friendship had sprung up,--or\nrather how it had been revived,--it would be bootless here to say.\nBut old alliances, such as that which had existed between the Aylmer\nand the Amedroz families, do not allow themselves to die out easily,\nand it is well for us all that they should be long-lived. So Captain\nAylmer brought his bride to Belton Park, and a small fatted calf was\nkilled, and the Askertons came to dinner,--on which occasion Captain\nAylmer behaved very well, though we may imagine that he must have had\nsome misgivings on the score of his young wife. The Askertons came\nto dinner, and the old rector, and the squire from a neighbouring\nparish, and everything was very handsome and very dull. Captain\nAylmer was much pleased with his visit, and declared to Lady Emily\nthat marriage had greatly improved Mr. William Belton. Now Will had\nbeen very dull the whole evening, and very unlike the fiery, violent,\nunreasonable man whom Captain Aylmer remembered to have met at the\nstation hotel of the Great Northern Railway.\n\n\"I was as sure of it as possible,\" Clara said to her husband that\nnight.\n\n\"Sure of what, my dear?\"\n\n\"That she would have a red nose.\"\n\n\"Who has got a red nose?\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid, Will. Who should have it but Lady Emily?\"\n\n\"Upon my word I didn't observe it.\"\n\n\"You never observe anything, Will; do you? But don't you think she is\nvery plain?\"\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know. She isn't as handsome as some people.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Will. How old do you suppose her to be?\"\n\n\"How old? Let me see. Thirty, perhaps.\"\n\n\"If she's not over forty, I'll consent to change noses with her.\"\n\n\"No;--we won't do that; not if I know it.\"\n\n\"I cannot conceive why any man should marry such a woman as that. Not\nbut what she's a very good woman, I dare say; only what can a man get\nby it? To be sure there's the title, if that's worth anything.\"\n\nBut Will Belton was never good for much conversation at this hour,\nand was too fast asleep to make any rejoinder to the last remark.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BELTON ESTATE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 4969-8.txt or 4969-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/4\/9\/6\/4969\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":361,"split":"train"}
