It deals with the persecution of the Christians community under Emperor Decius.\nThe main character of the novel is Callista, a young and beautiful Greek girl, who has arrived from Greece some years previously with her brother Aristo; they work for Agellius's uncle Jucundus, carving statues of pagan gods. She is a gifted young woman, yet she is unhappy with her life.\nAnother main character is the troubled young Christian Agellius, who wants to marry Callista. He is torn between his faith and his brother (Juba), his stepmother Gurta, a pagan witch, and his pagan uncle Jucundus, who all want to bring him away from the Christian faith. Agellius soon meets the mysterious Christian priest Caecilius (later identified as St. Cyprian of Carthage), who becomes a father figure for him and strengthens his faith again.\nAfter a terrible plague of locusts, popular rage against Christians breaks out and persecution starts once again. Agellius has to flee from the surroundings of Sicca Veneria. At the same time, Callista sees herself drawn more and more strongly to Christianity. When she is compelled to offer incense to the pagan gods, she has to make a dramatic choice, which finally leads her into the Catholic Church and then to martyrdom.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Callista by John Henry Cardinal Newman\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It has little in it of actual history, and not much\nclaim to antiquarian research; yet it has required more reading than may\nappear at first sight.\n\nIt is an attempt to imagine and express, from a Catholic point of view,\nthe feelings and mutual relations of Christians and heathens at the period\nto which it belongs, and it has been undertaken as the nearest approach\nwhich the Author could make to a more important work suggested to him from\na high ecclesiastical quarter.\n\n_September 13, 1855._\n\n\n\n\n                      POSTSCRIPTS TO LATER EDITIONS.\n\n\n_February 8, 1856._\u00e2\u0080\u0094Since the volume has been in print, the Author finds\nthat his name has got abroad. This gives him reason to add, that he wrote\ngreat part of Chapters I., IV., and V., and sketched the character and\nfortunes of Juba, in the early spring of 1848. He did no more till the end\nof last July, when he suddenly resumed the thread of his tale, and has\nbeen successful so far as this, that he has brought it to an end.\n\nWithout being able to lay his finger upon instances in point, he has some\nmisgiving lest, from a confusion between ancient histories and modern\ntravels, there should be inaccuracies, antiquarian or geographical, in\ncertain of his minor statements, which carry with them authority when they\ncease to be anonymous.\n\n\n\n_February 2, 1881.\u00e2\u0080\u0094October, 1888._\u00e2\u0080\u0094In a tale such as this, which professes\nin the very first sentence of its Advertisement to be simple fiction from\nbeginning to end, details may be allowably filled up by the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nimagination and coloured by his personal opinions and beliefs, the only\nrule binding on him being this\u00e2\u0080\u0094that he has no right to contravene\nacknowledged historical facts. Thus it is that Walter Scott exercises a\npoet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s licence in drawing his Queen Elizabeth and his Claverhouse, and the\nauthor of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRomola\u00e2\u0080\u009d has no misgivings in even imputing hypothetical motives\nand intentions to Savonarola. Who, again, would quarrel with Mr. Lockhart,\nwriting in Scotland, for excluding Pope, or Bishops, or sacrificial rites\nfrom his interesting Tale of Valerius?\n\nSuch was the understanding, as to what I might do and what I might not,\nwith which I wrote this story; and to make it clearer, I added in the\nlater editions of this Advertisement, that it was written \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom a Catholic\npoint of view;\u00e2\u0080\u009d while in the earlier, bearing in mind the interests of\nhistorical truth, and the anachronism which I had ventured on at page 82\nin the date of Arnobius and Lactantius, I said that I had not \u00e2\u0080\u009cadmitted\nany actual interference with known facts without notice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d questions of\nreligious controversy, when I said it, not even coming into my thoughts. I\ndid not consider my Tale to be in any sense controversial, but to be\nspecially addressed to Catholic readers, and for their edification.\n\nThis being so, it was with no little surprise I found myself lately\naccused of want of truth, because I have followed great authorities in\nattributing to Christians of the middle of the third century what is\ncertainly to be found in the fourth,\u00e2\u0080\u0094devotions, representations, and\ndoctrines, declaratory of the high dignity of the Blessed Virgin. If I had\nleft out all mention of these, I should have been simply untrue to my idea\nand apprehension of Primitive Christianity. To what positive and certain\nfacts do I run counter in so doing, even granting that I am indulging my\nimagination? But I have allowed myself no such indulgence; I gave good\nreasons long ago, in my \u00e2\u0080\u009cLetter to Dr. Pusey\u00e2\u0080\u009d (pp. 53\u00e2\u0080\u009376), for what I\nbelieve on this matter and for what I have in \u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista\u00e2\u0080\u009d described.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                CONTENTS.\n\n\n   CHAP.

The latter city,\nwhich was the seat of a Roman colony, lay upon a precipitous or steep\nbank, which led up along a chain of hills to a mountainous track in the\ndirection of the north and east. In striking contrast with this wild and\nbarren region was the view presented by the west and south, where for many\nmiles stretched a smiling champaign, exuberantly wooded, and varied with a\nthousand hues, till it was terminated at length by the successive tiers of\nthe Atlas, and the dim and fantastic forms of the Numidian mountains. The\nimmediate neighbourhood of the city was occupied by gardens, vineyards,\ncorn-fields, and meadows, crossed or encircled here by noble avenues of\ntrees or the remains of primeval forests, there by the clustering groves\nwhich wealth and luxury had created. This spacious plain, though level\nwhen compared with the northern heights by which the city was backed, and\nthe peaks and crags which skirted the southern and western horizon, was\ndiscovered, as light and shadow travelled with the sun, to be diversified\nwith hill and dale, upland and hollow; while orange gardens, orchards,\nolive and palm plantations held their appropriate sites on the slopes or\nthe bottoms. Through the mass of green, which extended still more thickly\nfrom the west round to the north, might be seen at intervals two solid\ncauseways tracking their persevering course to the Mediterranean coast,\nthe one to the ancient rival of Rome, the other to Hippo Regius in\nNumidia. Tourists might have complained of the absence of water from the\nscene; but the native peasant would have explained to them that the eye\nalone had reason to be discontented, and that the thick foliage and the\nuneven surface did but conceal what mother earth with no niggard bounty\nsupplied. The Bagradas, issuing from the spurs of the Atlas, made up in\ndepth what it wanted in breadth of bed, and ploughed the rich and yielding\nmould with its rapid stream, till, after passing Sicca in its way, it fell\ninto the sea near Carthage. It was but the largest of a multitude of\nothers, most of them tributaries to it, deepening as much as they\nincreased it. While channels had been cut from the larger rills for the\nirrigation of the open land, brooks, which sprang up in the gravel which\nlay against the hills, had been artificially banked with cut stones or\npaved with pebbles; and where neither springs nor rivulets were to be\nfound, wells had been dug, sometimes to the vast depth of as much as 200\nfathoms, with such effect that the spurting column of water had in some\ninstances drowned the zealous workmen who had been the first to reach it.\nAnd, while such were the resources of less favoured localities or seasons,\nprofuse rains descended over the whole region for one half of the year,\nand the thick summer dews compensated by night for the daily tribute\nextorted by an African sun.\n\nAt various distances over the undulating surface, and through the woods,\nwere seen the villas and the hamlets of that happy land. It was an age\nwhen the pride of architecture had been indulged to the full; edifices,\npublic and private, mansions and temples, ran off far away from each\nmarket-town or borough, as from a centre, some of stone or marble, but\nmost of them of that composite of fine earth, rammed tight by means of\nframes, for which the Saracens were afterwards famous, and of which\nspecimens remain to this day, as hard in surface, as sharp at the angles,\nas when they first were finished. Every here and there, on hill or crag,\ncrowned with basilicas and temples, radiant in the sun, might be seen the\ncities of the province or of its neighbourhood, Thibursicumber, Thugga,\nLaribus, Siguessa, Sufetula, and many others; while in the far distance,\non an elevated table-land under the Atlas, might be discerned the Colonia\nScillitana, famous about fifty years before the date of which we write for\nthe martyrdom of Speratus and his companions, who were beheaded at the\norder of the proconsul for refusing to swear by the genius of Rome and the\nemperor.\n\nIf the spectator now takes his stand, not in Sicca itself, but about a\nquarter of a mile to the south-east, on the hill or knoll on which was\nplaced the cottage of Agellius, the city itself will enter into the\npicture. Its name, Sicca Veneria, if it be derived (as some suppose) from\nthe Succoth benoth, or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctents of the daughters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d mentioned by the inspired\nwriter as an object of pagan worship in Samaria, shows that it owed its\nfoundation to the Ph\u00c5\u0093nician colonists of the country. At any rate, the\nPunic deities retained their hold upon the place; the temples of the\nTyrian Hercules and of Saturn, the scene of annual human sacrifices, were\nconspicuous in its outline, though these and all other religious buildings\nin it looked small beside the mysterious antique shrine devoted to the\nsensual rites of the Syrian Astarte. Public baths and a theatre, a\ncapitol, imitative of Rome, a gymnasium, the long outline of a portico, an\nequestrian statue in brass of the Emperor Severus, were grouped together\nabove the streets of a city, which, narrow and winding, ran up and down\nacross the hill. In its centre an extraordinary spring threw up\nincessantly several tons of water every minute, and was inclosed by the\nsuperstitious gratitude of the inhabitants with the peristylium of a\nsacred place. At the extreme back, towards the north, which could not be\nseen from the point of view where we last stationed ourselves, there was a\nsheer descent of rock, bestowing on the city, when it was seen at a\ndistance on the Mediterranean side, the same bold and striking appearance\nwhich attaches to Castro Giovanni, the ancient Enna, in the heart of\nSicily.\n\nAnd now, withdrawing our eyes from the panorama, whether in its distant or\nnearer objects, if we would at length contemplate the spot itself from\nwhich we have been last surveying it, we shall find almost as much to\nrepay attention, and to elicit admiration. We stand in the midst of a farm\nof some wealthy proprietor, consisting of a number of fields and gardens,\nseparated from each other by hedges of cactus or the aloe. At the foot of\nthe hill, which sloped down on the side furthest from Sicca to one of the\ntributaries of the rich and turbid river of which we have spoken, a large\nyard or garden, intersected with a hundred artificial rills, was devoted\nto the cultivation of the beautiful and odoriferous _khennah_. A thick\ngrove of palms seemed to triumph in the refreshment of the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side,\nand lifted up their thankful boughs towards heaven. The barley harvest in\nthe fields which lay higher up the hill was over, or at least was\nfinishing; and all that remained of the crop was the incessant and\nimportunate chirping of the _cicad\u00c3\u00a6_, and the rude booths of reeds and\nbulrushes, now left to wither, in which the peasant boys found shelter\nfrom the sun, while in an earlier month they frightened from the grain the\nmyriads of linnets, goldfinches, and other small birds who, as in other\ncountries, contested with the human proprietor the possession of it. On\nthe south-western slope lies a neat and carefully dressed vineyard, the\nvine-stakes of which, dwarfish as they are, already cast long shadows on\nthe eastern side. Slaves are scattered over it, testifying to the\nscorching power of the sun by their broad _petasus_, and to its oppressive\nheat by the scanty _subligarium_, which reached from the belt or girdle to\nthe knees. They are engaged in cutting off useless twigs to which the last\nshowers of spring have given birth, and are twisting those which promise\nfruit into positions where they will be safe both from the breeze and from\nthe sun. Everything gives token of that gracious and happy season which\nthe great Latin poets have hymned in their beautiful but heathen strains;\nwhen, after the heavy rains, and raw mists, and piercing winds, and fitful\nsun-gleams of a long six months, the mighty mother manifests herself anew,\nand pours out the resources of her innermost being for the life and\nenjoyment of every portion of the vast whole;\u00e2\u0080\u0094or, to apply the lines of a\nmodern bard\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the bare earth, till now\n  Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorned,\n  Brings forth the tender grass, whose verdure clads\n  Her universal face with pleasant green;\n  Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flower,\n  Opening their various colours, and make gay\n  Her bosom, swelling sweet; and, these scarce blown,\n  Forth flourishes the clustering vine, forth creeps\n  The swelling gourd, up stands the corny reed\n  Embattled in her fields, and the humble shrub,\n  And bush with frizzled hair implicit; last\n  Rise, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread\n  Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gem\n  Their blossoms; with high woods the hills are crowned\n  With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side\n  With borders long the rivers; that earth now\n  Seems like to heaven, a seat where gods might dwell,\n  Or wander with delight, and love to haunt\n  Her sacred shades.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA snatch from some old Greek chant, with something of plaintiveness in the\ntone, issues from the thicket just across the mule-path, cut deep in the\nearth, which reaches from the city gate to the streamlet; and a youth, who\nhad the appearance of the assistant bailiff or _procurator_ of the farm,\nleaped from it, and went over to the labourers, who were busy with the\nvines. His eyes and hair and the cast of his features spoke of Europe; his\nmanner had something of shyness and reserve, rather than of rusticity; and\nhe wore a simple red tunic with half sleeves, descending to the knee, and\ntightened round him by a belt. His legs and feet were protected by boots\nwhich came half up his calf. He addressed one of the slaves, and his voice\nwas gentle and cheerful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Sansar!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like your way of managing these branches\nso well as my own; but it is a difficult thing to move an old fellow like\nyou. You never fasten together the shoots which you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cut off, they\nare flying about quite wild, and the first ox that passes through the\nfield next month for the ploughing will break them off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke in Latin; the man understood it, and answered him in the same\nlanguage, though with deviations from purity of accent and syntax, not\nwithout parallel in the _talkee-talkee_ of the West Indian negro.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cay, ay; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all a mistake to use the\nplough at all. The fork does the work much better, and no fear for the\ngrape. I hide the tendril under the leaf against the sun, which is the\nonly enemy we have to consider.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! but the fork does not raise so much dust as the plough and the heavy\ncattle which draw it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the said dust does more for\nthe protection of the tendril than the shade of the leaf.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut those huge beasts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the slave, \u00e2\u0080\u009cturn up great ridges, and\ndestroy the yard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no good arguing with an old vinedresser, who had formed his theory\nbefore I was born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius good-humouredly; and he passed on into a\ngarden beyond.\n\nHere were other indications of the happy month through which the year was\nnow travelling. The garden, so to call it, was a space of several acres in\nextent; it was one large bed of roses, and preparation was making for\nextracting their essence, for which various parts of that country are to\nthis day celebrated. Here was another set of labourers, and a man of\nmiddle age was surveying them at his leisure. His business-like, severe,\nand off-hand manner bespoke the _villicus_ or bailiff himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlways here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas if you were a slave, not a Roman, my good\nfellow; yet slaves have their Saturnalia; always serving, not worshipping\nthe all-bounteous and all-blessed. Why are you not taking holiday in the\ntown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should I, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you recollect old Hiempsal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsaying about \u00e2\u0080\u0098one foot in the slipper, and one in the shoe.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Nothing would\nbe done well if I were a town-goer. You engaged me, I suppose, to be here,\nnot there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut at this season the empire, the genius of Rome, the\ncustoms of the country, demand it, and above all the great goddess Astarte\nand her genial, jocund month. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Parturit almus ager;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you know the verse;\ndo not be out of tune with Nature, nor clash and jar with the great system\nof the universe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA cloud of confusion, or of distress, passed over Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. He\nseemed as if he wished to speak; at length he merely said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fault\non the right side in a servant, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the way of your people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vitricus replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCorybantians,\nPhrygians, Jews, what do you call yourselves? There are so many fantastic\nreligions now-a-days. Hang yourself outright at your house-door, if you\nare tired of living\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you are a sensible fellow. How can any man, whose\nhead sits right upon his shoulders, say that life is worth having, and not\nworth enjoying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a quiet being,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like the country, which you\nthink so tame, and care little for the flaunting town. Tastes differ.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTown! you need not go to Sicca,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the bailiff, \u00e2\u0080\u009call Sicca is out\nof town. It has poured into the fields, and groves, and river side. Lift\nup your eyes, man alive, open your ears, and let pleasure flow in. Be\npassive under the sweet breath of the goddess, and she will fill you with\necstasy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was as Vitricus had said; the solemn feast-days of Astarte were in\ncourse of celebration; of Astarte, the well-known divinity of Carthage and\nits dependent cities, whom Heliogabalus had lately introduced to Rome, who\nin her different aspects was at once Urania, Juno, and Aphrodite,\naccording as she embodied the idea of the philosopher, the statesman, or\nthe vulgar; lofty and intellectual as Urania, majestic and commanding as\nJuno, seductive as the goddess of sensuality and excess.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere goes the son of as good and frank a soldier as ever brandished\npilum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vitricus to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctill in his last years some infernal\ngod took umbrage at him, and saddled him and his with one of those absurd\nsuperstitions which are as plentiful here as serpents. He indeed was too\nold himself to get much harm from it; but it shows its sour nature in\nthese young shoots. A good servant, but the plague\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in his bones, and he\nwill rot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis subordinate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflections were of a different character: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very air\nbreathes sin to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009coh that I did not find the taint of the\ncity in these works of God! Alas! sweet Nature, the child of the Almighty,\nis made to do the fiend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, and does it better than the town. O ye\nbeautiful trees and fair flowers, O bright sun and balmy air, what a\nbondage ye are in, and how do ye groan till you are redeemed from it! Ye\nare bond-slaves, but not willingly, as man is; but how will you ever be\nturned to nobler purpose? How is this vast, this solid establishment of\nerror, the incubus of many thousand years, ever to have an end? You\nyourselves, dear ones, will come to nought first. Anyhow, the public way\nis no place for me this evening. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon be back from their accursed\nrevelry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA sound of horns and voices had been heard from time to time through the\nwoods, as if proceeding from parties dispersed through them; and in the\ngrowing twilight might be seen lights, glancing and wandering through the\nfoliage. The cottage in which Agellius dwelt was on the other side of the\nhollow bridle-way which crossed the hill. To make for home he had first to\nwalk some little distance along it; and scarcely had he descended into it\nfor that purpose, when he found himself in the front of a band of\nrevellers, who were returning from some scene of impious festivity. They\nwere arrayed in holiday guise, as far as they studied dress at all; the\nsymbols of idolatry were on their foreheads and arms; some of them were\nintoxicated, and most of them were women.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy have you not been worshipping, young fellow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cComely built,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut struck by the furies. I know the cut of\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Astarte,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a third, \u00e2\u0080\u009che\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those sly Gnostics! I have seen\nthe chap before, with his hangdog look. He is one of Pluto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whelps, first\ncousin to Cerberus, and his name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Channibal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn which they all began to shout out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Channibal, Channibal, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\na lad that knows you. Old fellow, come along with us;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the speaker\nmade a dash at him.\n\nOn this Agellius, who was slowly making his way past them on the broken\nand steep path, leapt up in two or three steps to the ridge, and went away\nin security; when one woman cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO the toad, I know him now; he is\na wizard; he eats little children; didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see him make that sign? it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\na charm. My sister did it; the fool left me to be one of them. She was\never doing so\u00e2\u0080\u009d (mimicking the sign of the cross). \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Christian,\nblight him! he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn us into beasts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCerberus, bite him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another, \u00e2\u0080\u009che sucks blood;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and taking up a\nstone, she made it whiz past his ear as he disappeared from view. A\ngeneral scream of contempt and hatred followed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head?\nput out the lights, put out the lights! gibbet him! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he has not\nbeen with honest people down in the vale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then they struck up a\nblasphemous song, the sentiments of which we are not going even to\nconceive, much less to attempt in words.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER II.\n\n\n                          CHRISTIANITY IN SICCA.\n\n\nThe revellers went on their way; Agellius went on his, and made for his\nlowly and lonely cottage. He was the elder of the two sons of a Roman\nlegionary of the Secunda Italica, who had settled with them in Sicca,\nwhere he lost their mother, and died, having in his old age become a\nChristian. The fortitude of some confessors at Carthage in the persecution\nof Severus had been the initial cause of his conversion. He had been\nposted as one of their guards, and had attended them to the scene of their\nmartyrdom, in addition to the civil force, to whom in the proconsulate the\nadministration of the law was committed. Therefore, happily for him, it\ncould not fall to his duty to be their executioner, a function which,\nhowever revolting to his feelings, he might not have had courage to\ndecline. He remained a pagan, though he could not shake off the impression\nwhich the martyrs had made upon him; and, after completing his time of\nservice, he retired to the protection of some great friends in Sicca, his\nbrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home already. Here he took a second wife of the old Numidian\nstock, and supported himself by the produce of a small piece of land which\nhad been given to him for life by the imperial government. If trial were\nnecessary in order to keep alive the good seed which had been sown in his\nheart, he found a never-failing supply of that article in the companion of\nhis declining years. In the hey-day of her youth she might have been\nfitted to throw a sort of sunshine, or rather torchlight, on a military\ncarouse; but now, when poor Strabo, a man well to do in the world, looking\nfor peace, had fallen under her arts, he found he had surrendered his\nfreedom to a malignant, profligate woman, whose passions made her better\ncompany for evil spirits than for an invalided soldier. Indeed, as time\nwent on, the popular belief, which she rather encouraged, went to the\nextent that she actually did hold an intercourse with the unseen world;\nand certainly she matured in a hatred towards God and man, which would\nnaturally follow, and not unnaturally betoken, such intercourse. The more,\nthen, she inflicted on him her proficiency in these amiable\ncharacteristics, the more he looked out for some consolation elsewhere;\nand the more she involved herself in the guilt or the repute of unlawful\narts, the more was he drawn to that religion, where alone to commune with\nthe invisible is to hold intercourse with heaven, not with hell. Whether\nso great a trial supplied a more human inducement for looking towards\nChristianity, it is impossible to say. Most men, certainly Roman soldiers,\nmay be considered to act on mixed motives; but so it was in fact, that, on\nhis becoming in his last years a Christian, he found, perhaps discovered,\nto his great satisfaction, that the Church did not oblige him to continue\nor renew a tie which bound him to so much misery, and that he might end\nhis days in a tranquillity which his past life required, and his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npresence would have precluded. He made a good end; he had been allowed to\ntake the blessed sacrament from the altar to his own home on the last time\nhe had been able to attend a _synaxis_ of the faithful, and thus had\ncommunicated at least six months within his decease; and the priest who\nanointed him at the beginning of his last illness also took his\nconfession. He died, begging forgiveness of all whom he had injured, and\ngiving large alms to the poor. This was about the year 236, in the midst\nof that long peace of the Church, which was broken at length by the Decian\npersecution.\n\nThis peace of well-nigh fifty years had necessarily a peculiar, and not a\nhappy effect upon the Christians of the proconsulate. They multiplied in\nthe greater and the maritime cities, and made their way into positions of\nimportance, whether in trade or the governmental departments; they\nextended their family connections, and were on good terms with the\nheathen. Whatever jealousy might be still cherished against the Christian\nname, nevertheless, individual Christians were treated with civility, and\nrecognised as citizens; though among the populace there would be\noccasions, at the time of the more solemn pagan feasts, when accidental\noutbursts might be expected of the antipathy latent in the community, as\nwe have been recording in the foregoing chapter. Men of sense, however,\nbegan to understand them better, and to be more just to the reasonableness\nof their faith. This would lead them to scorn Christianity less, but it\nwould lead them to fear it more. It was no longer a matter merely for the\npopulace to insult, but for government deliberately to put down. The\nprevailing and still growing unbelief among the lower classes of the\npopulation did but make a religion more formidable, which, as heathen\nstatesmen felt, was able to wield the weapons of enthusiasm and zeal with\na force and success unknown even to the most fortunate impostors among the\nOriental or Egyptian hierophants. The philosophical schools were impressed\nwith similar apprehensions, and had now for fifty years been employed in\ncreating and systematising a new intellectual basis for the received\npaganism.\n\nBut, while the signs of the times led to the anticipation that a struggle\nwas impending between the heads of the state religion and of the new\nworship which was taking its place, the great body of Christians, laymen\nand ecclesiastics, were on better and better terms, individually, with the\nmembers of society, or what is now called the public; and without losing\ntheir faith or those embers of charity which favourable circumstances\nwould promptly rekindle, were, it must be confessed, in a state of\nconsiderable relaxation; they often were on the brink of deplorable sins,\nand sometimes fell over the brink. And many would join the Church on\ninferior motives as soon as no great temporal disadvantage attached to the\nact; or the families of Christian parents might grow up with so little of\nmoral or religious education as to make it difficult to say why they\ncalled themselves members of a divine religion. Mixed marriages would\nincrease both the scandal and the confusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA long repose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says St. Cyprian, speaking of this very period, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad\ncorrupted the discipline which had come down to us. Every one was applying\nhimself to the increase of wealth; and, forgetting both the conduct of the\nfaithful under the Apostles, and what ought to be their conduct in every\nage, with insatiable eagerness for gain devoted himself to the multiplying\nof possessions. The priests were wanting in religious devotedness, the\nministers in entireness of faith; there was no mercy in works, no\ndiscipline in manners. Men wore their beards disfigured, and woman dyed\ntheir faces. Their eyes were changed from what God made them, and a lying\ncolour was passed upon the hair. The hearts of the simple were misled by\ntreacherous artifices, and brethren became entangled in seductive snares.\nTies of marriage were formed with unbelievers; members of Christ abandoned\nto the heathen. Not only rash swearing was heard, but even false; persons\nin high place were swollen with contemptuousness; poisoned reproaches fell\nfrom their mouths, and men were sundered by unabating quarrels. Numerous\nbishops, who ought to be an encouragement and example to others, despising\ntheir sacred calling, engaged themselves in secular vocations,\nrelinquished their sees, deserted their people, strayed among foreign\nprovinces, hunted the markets for mercantile profits, and tried to amass\nlarge sums of money, while they had brethren starving within the Church;\ntook possession of estates by fraudulent proceedings, and multiplied their\ngains by accumulated usuries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(1)\n\nThe relaxation which would extend the profession of Christianity in the\nlarger cities would contract or extinguish it in remote or country places.\nThere would be little zeal to keep up Churches, which could not be served\nwithout an effort or without secular loss. Carthage, Utica, Hippo,\nMilevis, or Curubis, was a more attractive residence than the towns with\nuncouth African names, which amaze the ecclesiastical student in the Acts\nof the Councils. Vocations became scarce; sees remained vacant;\ncongregations died out. This was pretty much the case with the Church and\nsee of Sicca. At the time of which we write, history preserves no record\nof any bishop as exercising his pastoral functions in that city. In matter\nof fact there was none. The last bishop, an amiable old man, had in the\ncourse of years acquired a considerable extent of arable land, and\nemployed himself principally, for lack of more spiritual occupation, in\nreaping, stacking, selling, and sending off his wheat for the Roman\nmarket. His deacon had been celebrated in early youth for his boldness in\nthe chase, and took part in the capture of lions and panthers (an act of\ncharity towards the peasants round Sicca) for the Roman amphitheatre. No\npriests were to be found, and the bishop became _parochus_ till his death.\nAfterwards infants and catechumens lost baptism; parents lost faith, or at\nleast love; wanderers lost repentance and conversion. For a while there\nwas a flourishing meeting-house of Tertullianists, who had scared more\nhumble minds by pronouncing the eternal perdition of every Catholic; there\nhad also been various descriptions of Gnostics, who had carried off the\nclever youths and restless speculators; and then there had been the lapse\nof time, gradually consuming the generation which had survived the\nflourishing old days of the African Church. And the result was, that in\nthe year 250 it was difficult to say of whom the Church of Sicca\nconsisted. There was no bishop, no priest, no deacon. There was the old\n_mansionarius_ or sacristan; there were two or three pious women, married\nor single, who owed their religion to good mothers; there were some slaves\nwho kept to their faith, no one knew how or why; there were a vast many\npersons who ought to be Catholics, but were heretics, or nothing at all,\nor all but pagans, and sure to become pagans on the asking; there were\nAgellius and his brother Juba, and how far these two had a claim to the\nChristian name we now proceed to explain.\n\nThey were about the ages of seven and eight when their father died, and\nthey fell under the guardianship of their uncle, whose residence at Sicca\nhad been one of the reasons which determined Strabo to settle there. This\nman, being possessed of some capital, drove a thriving trade in idols,\nlarge and small, amulets, and the like instruments of the established\nsuperstition. His father had come to Carthage in the service of one of the\nassessors of the proconsul of the day; and his son, finding competition\nran too high to give him prospect of remuneration in the metropolis, had\nopened his statue-shop in Sicca. Those modern arts which enable an English\ntown in this day to be so fertile in the production of ware of this\ndescription for the markets of the pagan East, were then unknown; and\nJucundus depended on certain artists whom he imported, especially on two\nGreeks, brother and sister, who came from some isle on the Asian coast,\nfor the supply of his trade. He was a good-natured man, self-indulgent,\npositive, and warmly attached to the reigning paganism, both as being the\nlaw of the land and the vital principle of the state; and, while he was\nreally kind to his orphan nephews, he simply abominated, as in duty bound,\nthe idiotic cant and impudent fee-fa-fum, to which, in his infallible\njudgment, poor old Strabo had betrayed his children. He would have\nrestored them, you may be quite sure, to their country and to their\ncountry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gods, had they acquiesced in the restoration: but in different\nways these little chaps, and he shook his head as he said it, were\ndifficult to deal with. Agellius had a very positive opinion of his own on\nthe matter; and as for Juba, though he had no opinion at all, yet he had\nan equally positive aversion to have thrust on him by another any opinion\nat all, even in favour of paganism. He had remained in his catechumen\nstate since he grew up, because he found himself in it; and though nothing\nwould make him go forward in his profession of Christianity, no earthly\npower would be able to make him go back. So there he was, like a mule,\nstruck fast in the door of the Church, and feeling a gratification in his\nindependence of mind. However, whatever his profession might be, still, as\ntime went on, he plainly took after his step-mother, renewed his\nintercourse with her after his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, and at length went so far\nas to avow that he believed in nothing but the devil, if even he believed\nin him. It was scarcely safe, however, to affirm that the senses of this\nhopeful lad were his own.\n\nAgellius, on the other hand, when a boy of six years old, had insisted on\nreceiving baptism; had perplexed his father by a manifestation of zeal to\nwhich the old man was a stranger; and had made the good bishop lose the\ncorn-fleet which was starting for Italy from his importunity to learn the\nCatechism. Baptized he was, confirmed, communicated; but a boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature is\nvariable, and by the time Agellius had reached adolescence, the gracious\nimpulses of his childhood had in some measure faded away, though he still\nretained his faith in its first keenness and vigour. But he had no one to\nkeep him up to his duty; no exhortations, no example, no sympathy. His\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends had taken him up so far as this, that by an extraordinary\nfavour they had got him a lease for some years of the property which\nStrabo, a veteran soldier, had held of the imperial government. The care\nof this small property fell upon him, and another and more serious charge\nwas added to it. The long prosperity of the province had increased the\nopulence and enlarged the upper class of Sicca. Officials, contractors,\nand servants of the government had made fortunes, and raised villas in the\nneighbourhood of the city. Natives of the place, returning from Rome, or\nfrom provincial service elsewhere, had invested their gains in long leases\nof state lands, or of the farms belonging to the imperial _res privata_ or\nprivy purse, and had become virtual proprietors of the rich fields or\nbeautiful gardens in which they had played as children. One of such\npersons, who had had a place in the _officium_ of the qu\u00c3\u00a6stor, or rather\nprocurator, as he began to be called, was the employer of Agellius. His\nproperty adjoined the cottage of the latter; and, having first employed\nthe youth from recollection of his father, he confided to him the place of\nunder-bailiff from the talents he showed for farm-business.\n\nSuch was his position at the early age of twenty-two; but honourable as it\nwas in itself, and from the mode in which it was obtained, no one would\nconsider it adapted, under the circumstances, to counteract the religious\nlanguor and coldness which had grown upon him. And in truth he did not\nknow where he stood further than that he was firm in faith, as we have\nsaid, and had shrunk from a boy upwards, from the vice and immorality\nwhich was the very atmosphere of Sicca. He might any day be betrayed into\nsome fatal inconsistency, which would either lead him into sin, or oblige\nhim abruptly to retrace his steps, and find a truer and safer position. He\nwas not generally known to be a Christian, at least for certain, though he\nwas seen to keep clear of the established religion. It was not that he\nhid, so much as that the world did not care to know, what he believed. In\nthat day there were many rites and worships which kept to themselves\u00e2\u0080\u0094many\nforms of moroseness or misanthropy, as they were considered, which\nwithdrew their votaries from the public ceremonial. The Catholic faith\nseemed to the multitude to be one of these; it was only in critical times,\nwhen some idolatrous act was insisted on by the magistrate, that the\nspecific nature of Christianity was tested and detected. Then at length it\nwas seen to differ from all other religious varieties by that irrational\nand disgusting obstinacy, as it was felt to be, which had rather suffer\ntorments and lose life than submit to some graceful, or touching, or at\nleast trifling observance which the tradition of ages had sanctioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER III.\n\n\n                         AGELLIUS IN HIS COTTAGE.\n\n\nThe cottage for which Agellius was making, when last we had sight of him,\nwas a small brick house consisting of one room, with a loft over it, and a\nkitchen on the side, not very unlike that holy habitation which once\ncontained the Eternal Word in human form with His Virgin Mother, and\nJoseph, their guardian. It was situated on the declivity of the hill, and,\nunlike the gardens of Italy, the space before it was ornamented with a\nplot of turf. A noble palm on one side, in spite of its distance from the\nwater, and a group of orange-trees on the other, formed a foreground to\nthe rich landscape which was described in our opening chapter. The borders\nand beds were gay with the lily, the bacchar, amber-coloured and purple,\nthe golden abrotomus, the red chelidonium, and the variegated iris.\nAgainst the wall of the house were trained pomegranates, with their\ncrimson blossoms, the star-like pothos or jessamine, and the symbolical\npassionflower, which well became a Christian dwelling.\n\nAnd it was an intimation of what would be found within; for on one side of\nthe room was rudely painted a red cross, with doves about it, as is found\nin early Christian shrines to this day. So long had been the peace of the\nChurch, that the tradition of persecution seemed to have been lost; and\nChristians allowed themselves in the profession of their faith at home,\ncautious as they might be in public places; as freely as now in England,\nwhere we do not scruple to raise crucifixes within our churches and\nhouses, though we shrink from doing so within sight of the hundred cabs\nand omnibuses which rattle past them. Under the cross were two or three\npictures, or rather sketches. In the centre stood the Blessed Virgin with\nhands spread out in prayer, attended by the holy Apostles Peter and Paul\non her right and left. Under this representation was rudely scratched upon\nthe wall the word, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdvocata,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a title which the earliest antiquity\nbestows upon her. On a small shelf was placed a case with two or three\nrolls or sheets of parchment in it. The appearance of them spoke of use\nindeed, but of reverential treatment. These were the Psalms, the Gospel\naccording to St. Luke, and St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Epistle to the Romans, in the old\nLatin version. The Gospel was handsomely covered, and ornamented with\ngold.\n\nThe apartment was otherwise furnished with such implements and materials\nas might be expected in the cottage of a countryman: one or two stools and\nbenches for sitting, a table, and in one corner a heap of dried leaves and\nrushes, with a large crimson coverlet, for rest at night. Elsewhere were\ntwo millstones fixed in a frame, with a handle attached to the rim of one\nof them, for grinding corn. Then again, garden tools; boxes of seeds; a\nvessel containing syrup for assuaging the sting of the scorpion; the\n_asir-rese_ or _anagallis_, a potent medicine of the class of poisons,\nwhich was taken in wine for the same mischance. It hung from the beams,\nwith a large bunch of _atsirtiphua_, a sort of camomile, smaller in the\nflower and more fragrant than our own, which was used as a febrifuge.\nThence, too, hung a plentiful gathering of dried grapes, of the kind\ncalled _duracin\u00c3\u00a6_; and near the door a bough of the green _bargut_ or\n_psyllium_, to drive away the smaller insects.\n\nPoor Agellius felt the contrast between the ungodly turmoil from which he\nhad escaped, and the deep stillness into which he now had entered; but\nneither satisfied him quite. There was no repose out of doors, and no\nrelief within. He was lonely at home, lonely in the crowd. He needed the\nsympathy of his kind; hearts which might beat with his heart; friends with\nwhom he might share his joys and griefs; advisers whom he might consult;\nminds like his own, who would understand him\u00e2\u0080\u0094minds unlike his own, who\nwould succour and respond to him. A very great trial certainly this, in\nwhich the soul is flung back upon itself; and that especially in the case\nof the young, for whom memory and experience do so little, and wayward and\nexcited feelings do so much. Great gain had it been for Agellius, even in\nits natural effect, putting aside higher benefits, to have been able to\nrecur to sacramental confession; but to confession he had never been,\nthough once or twice he had attended the public _homologesis_ of the\nChurch. Shall we wonder that the poor youth began to be despondent and\nimpatient under his trial? Shall we not feel for him, though we may be\nsorry for him, should it turn out that he was looking restlessly into\nevery corner of the small world of acquaintance in which his lot lay, for\nthose with whom he could converse easily, and interchange speculation,\nargument, aspiration, and affection?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one cares for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he sat down on his rustic bench. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nnothing to any one; I am a hermit, like Elias or John, without the call to\nbe one. Yet even Elias felt the burden of being one against many; even\nJohn asked at length in expostulation, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Art Thou He that shall come?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Am I\nfor ever to have the knowledge, without the consolation, of the truth? am\nI for ever to belong to a great divine society, yet never see the face of\nany of its members?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused in his thoughts, as if drinking in the full taste and measure of\nhis unhappiness. And then his reflections took a turn, and he said,\nsuddenly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do I not leave Sicca? What binds me to my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farm? I\nam young, and my interest in it will soon expire. What keeps me from\nCarthage, Hippo, Cirtha, where Christians are so many?\u00e2\u0080\u009d But here he\nstopped as suddenly as he had begun; and a strange feeling, half pang,\nhalf thrill, went through his heart. And he felt unwilling to pursue his\nthought, or to answer the question which he had asked; and he settled into\na dull, stagnant condition of mind, in which he seemed hardly to think at\nall.\n\nBe of good cheer, solitary one, though thou art not a hero yet! There is\nOne that cares for thee, and loves thee, more than thou canst feel, love,\nor care for thyself. Cast all thy care upon Him. He sees thee, and is\nwatching thee; He is hanging over thee, and smiles in compassion at thy\ntroubles. His angel, who is thine, is whispering good thoughts to thee. He\nknows thy weakness; He foresees thy errors; but He holds thee by thy right\nhand, and thou shalt not, canst not escape Him. By thy faith, which thou\nhast so simply, resolutely retained in the midst of idolatry; by thy\npurity, which, like some fair flower, thou hast cherished in the midst of\npollution, He will remember thee in thy evil hour, and thine enemy shall\nnot prevail against thee!\n\nWhat means that smile upon Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face? It is the response of the\nchild to the loving parent. He knows not why, but the cloud is past. He\nsigns himself with the holy cross, and sweet reviving thoughts enliven\nhim. He names the sacred Name, and it is like ointment poured out upon his\nsoul. He rises; he kneels down under the dread symbol of his salvation;\nand he begins his evening prayer.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IV.\n\n\n                                  JUBA.\n\n\nThere was more of heart, less of effort, less of mechanical habit, in\nAgellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prayers that night, than there had been for a long while\nbefore. He got up, struck a light, and communicated it to his small\nearthen lamp. Its pale rays feebly searched the room and discovered at the\nother end of it Juba, who had silently opened the door, and sat down near\nit, while his brother was employed upon his devotions. The countenance of\nthe latter fell, for he was not to go to sleep with the resignation and\npeace which had just before been poured into his breast. Yet why should he\ncomplain? we receive consolation in this world for the very purpose of\npreparing us against trouble to come. Juba was a tall, swarthy,\nwild-looking youth. He was holding his head on one side as he sat, and his\nface towards the roof; he nodded obliquely, arched his eyebrows, pursed up\nhis lips, and crossed his arms, while he gave utterance to a strange,\nhalf-whispered laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe, he, he!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso you are on your knees, Agellius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I be at this hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand before I go to\nbed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, every one to his taste, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut to an unprejudiced\nmind there is something unworthy in the act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Juba?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his brother somewhat sharply; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you profess any\nreligion at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps I do, and perhaps I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut never shall it be\na bowing and scraping, crawling and cringing religion. You may take your\noath of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ails you to come here at this time of night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho\nasked for your company?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will come just when I please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand go when I please. I\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give an account of my actions to any one, God or man, devil or\npriest, much less to you. What right have you to ask me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never get peace or comfort as long as you\nlive, that I can tell you, let alone the life to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJuba kept silent for awhile, and bit his nails with a smile on his face,\nand his eyes looking askance upon the ground. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want no more than I have;\nI am well content,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cContented with yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Agellius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Juba replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhom ought one to wish rather to content?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose, your Creator.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCreator,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba, tossing back his head with an air of\nsuperiority; \u00e2\u0080\u009cCreator;\u00e2\u0080\u0094that, I consider, is an assumption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, my dear brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go on in that dreadful way!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Go on!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who began? Is one man to lay down the law, and not the other\ntoo? Is it so generally received, this belief of a Creator? Who have\nbrought in the belief? The Christians. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the Christians that began it.\nThe world went on very well without it before their rise. And now, who\nbegan the dispute but you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if I did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. You began in coming\nhere; what in the world are you come for? by what right do you disturb me\nat this hour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was no appearance of anger in Juba; he seemed as free from feeling\nof every kind, from what is called _heart_, as if he had been a stone. In\nanswer to his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question, he quietly said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been down\nthere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pointing in the direction of the woods.\n\nAn expression of sharp anguish passed over his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and for a\nmoment he was silent. At length he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to say you have\nbeen down to poor mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba.\n\nThere was again a silence for a little while; then Agellius renewed the\nconversation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have fallen off sadly, Juba, in the course of the last\nseveral years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJuba tossed his head, and crossed his legs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one time I thought you would have been baptized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his brother\ncontinued.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was my weakness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was a weak moment: it was just\nafter the old bishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. He had been kind to me as a child; and he\nsaid some womanish words to me, and it was excusable in me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh that you had yielded to your wish!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius.\n\nJuba looked superior. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fit passed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have come to a juster\nview of things. It is not every one who has the strength of mind. I\nconsider that a logical head comes to a very different conclusion;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he\nbegan wagging his own, to the right and left, as if it were coming to a\ngreat many.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, gaping, and desiring at least to come to a\nconclusion of the altercation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat brings you here so late?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was on my way to Jucundus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand have been delayed by the\nSuccoth-benoth in the grove across the river.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere they were thrown back upon their controversy. Agellius turned quite\nwhite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat were you there for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo see the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unmanly not to see it. Why\nshouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I see it? It was good fun. I despise them all, fools and idiots.\nThere they were, scampering about, or lying like hogs, all in liquor. Apes\nand swine! However, I will do as others do, if I please. I will be as\ndrunk as they, when I see good. I am my own master, and it would be no\nkind of harm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo harm! why, is it no harm to become an ape or a hog?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take just views of human nature,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba, with a\nself-satisfied air. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur first duty is to seek our own happiness. If a man\nthinks it happier to be a hog, why, let him be a hog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he laughed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is where you are narrow-minded. I shall seek my own happiness, and\ntry this way, if I please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHappiness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere have you been picking up all this\nstuff? Can you call such detestable filth happiness?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you know about such matters?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Juba. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you ever see them?\nDid you ever try them? You would be twice the man you are if you had. You\nwill not be a man till you do. You are carried off your legs in your own\nway. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather get drunk every day than fall down on all fours as you do,\ncrawling on your stomach like a worm, and whining like a hound that has\nbeen beaten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, as I live, you shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop here one instant longer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried out\nAgellius, starting up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe off with you! get away! what do you come here\nto blaspheme for? who wants you? who asked for you? Go! go, I say! take\nyourself off! Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you go? Keep your ribaldry for others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as good as you any day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t set myself up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to\nconfound Christian and unbeliever as you do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChristian and unbeliever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, slowly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose, when they are\na-courting each other, they _are_ confounded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked hard at Agellius,\nas if he thought he had hit a blot. Then he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I _were_ a\nChristian, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be so in earnest: else I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be an honest heathen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius coloured somewhat, and sat down, as if under embarrassment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI despise you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have not the pluck to be a Christian. Be\nconsistent, and fizz upon a stake; but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not made of that stuff.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even afraid of uncle. Nay, you can be caught by those painted\nwares, about which, when it suits your purpose, you can be so grave. I\ndespise you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI despise you, and the whole kit of you.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference between you and another? Your people say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nvanity, life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dream, riches a deceit, pleasure a snare. Fratres\ncharissimi, the time is short;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but who love earth and life and riches and\npleasure better than they? You are all of you as fond of the world, as set\nupon gain, as chary of reputation, as ambitious of power, as the jolly old\nheathen, who, you say, is going the way of the pit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is one thing to have a conscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009canother thing\nto act upon it. The conscience of these poor people is darkened. You had a\nconscience once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConscience, conscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, certainly, once I had a\nconscience. Yes, and once I had a bad chill, and went about chattering and\nshivering; and once I had a game leg, and then I went limping; and so, you\nsee, I once on a time had a conscience. O yes, I have had many consciences\nbefore now\u00e2\u0080\u0094white, black, yellow, and green; they were all bad; but they\nare all gone, and now I have none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius said nothing; his one wish, as may be supposed, was to get rid of\nso unwelcome a visitor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe truth is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Juba, with the air of a teacher\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe truth is,\nthat religion was a fashion with me, which is now gone by. It was the\ncomplexion of a particular stage of my life. I was neither the better nor\nthe worse for it. It was an accident, like the bloom on my face, which\nsoon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, spreading his fingers over his dirty-coloured cheeks, and\nstroking them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich soon will disappear. I acted according to the\nfeeling, while it lasted; but I can no more recall it than my first teeth,\nor the down on my chin. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s among the things that were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius still keeping silence from weariness and disgust, he looked at\nhim in a significant way, and said, slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see how it is; I have\npenetration enough to perceive that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe a bit more about\nreligion than I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not say that under my roof,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius, feeling he must not\nlet his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charge pass without a protest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany are my sins, but\nunbelief is not one of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJuba tossed his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I can see through a stone slab as well as\nany one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is as I have said; but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too proud to confess\nit. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of your hypocrisy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius coldly, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have done. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting late, Juba;\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be missed at home. Jucundus will be inquiring for you, and some of\nthose revelling friends of yours may do you a mischief by the way. Why, my\ngood fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, in surprise, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have no leggings. The\nscorpions will catch hold of you to a certainty in the dark. Come, let me\ntie some straw wisps about you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo fear of scorpions for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have some real good\namulets for the occasion, which even _boola-kog_ and _uffah_ will\nrespect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSaying this, he passed out of the room as unceremoniously as he had\nentered it, and took the direction of the city, talking to himself, and\nsinging snatches of wild airs as he went along, throwing back and shaking\nhis head, and now and then uttering a sharp internal laugh. Disdaining to\nfollow the ordinary path, he dived down into the thick and wet grass, and\nscrambled through the ravine, which the public road crossed before it\nascended the hill. Meanwhile he accompanied his quickened pace with a\nlouder strain, and it ran as follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe little black Moor is the mate for me,\n  When the night is dark, and the earth is free,\n  Under the limbs of the broad yew-tree.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas Father Cham that planted that yew,\n  And he fed it fat with the bloody dew\n  Of a score of brats, as his lineage grew.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFooting and flaunting it, all in the night,\n  Each lock flings fire, each heel strikes light;\n  No lamps need they, whose breath is bright.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere he was interrupted by a sudden growl, which sounded almost under his\nfeet, and some wild animal was seen to slink away. Juba showed no\nsurprise; he had taken out a small metal idol, and whispering some words\nto it, had presented it to the animal. He clambered up the bank, gained\nthe city gate, and made his way for his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dwelling, which was near\nthe temple of Astarte.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                CHAPTER V.\n\n\n                           JUCUNDUS AT SUPPER.\n\n\nThe house of Jucundus was closed for the night when Juba reached it, or\nyou would see, were you his companion, that it was one of the most showy\nshops in Sicca. It was the image-store of the place, and set out for sale,\nnot articles of statuary alone, but of metal, of mosaic work, and of\njewellery, as far as they were dedicated to the service of paganism. It\nwas bright with the many colours adopted in the embellishment of images,\nand the many lights which silver and gold, brass and ivory, alabaster,\ngypsum, talc, and glass reflected. Shelves and cabinets were laden with\nwares; both the precious material, and the elaborated trinket. All tastes\nwere suited, the popular and the refined, the fashion of the day and the\nlove of the antique, the classical and the barbarian devotion. There you\nmight see the rude symbols of invisible powers, which, originating in\ndeficiency of art, had been perpetuated by reverence for the past: the\nmysterious cube of marble sacred among the Arabs, the pillar which was the\nemblem of Mercury or Bacchus, the broad-based cone of Heliogabalus, the\npyramid of Paphos, and the tile or brick of Juno.\n\nThere, too, were the unmeaning blocks of stone with human heads, which\nwere to be dressed out in rich robes, and to simulate the human form.\nThere were other articles besides, as portable as these were unmanageable:\nlittle Junos, Mercuries, Dianas, and Fortunas, for the bosom or the\ngirdle. Household gods were there, and the objects of personal devotion:\nMinerva or Vesta, with handsome niches or shrines in which they might\nreside. There, too, were the brass crowns, or _nimbi_ which were intended\nto protect the heads of the gods from bats and birds. There you might buy,\nwere you a heathen, rings with heads on them of Jupiter, Mars, the Sun,\nSerapis, and above all Astarte. You would find there the rings and signets\nof the Basilidians; amulets too of wood or ivory: figures of demons,\npreternaturally ugly; little skeletons, and other superstitious devices.\nIt would be hard, indeed, if you could not be pleased, whatever your\nreligious denomination\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless indeed you were determined to reject all the\nappliances and objects of idolatry indiscriminately\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in that case you\nwould rejoice that it was night when you arrived there, and, in\nparticular, that darkness swallowed up other appliances and objects of\npagan worship, which to darkness were due by a particular title, and by\ndarkness were best shrouded, till the coming of that day when all things,\ngood and evil, shall be made light.\n\nThe shop, as we have said, was closed, concealed from view by large\nlumbering shutters, and made secure by heavy bars of wood. So we must\nenter by the passage or vestibule on the right side, and that will conduct\nus into a modest _atrium_, with an _impluvium_ on one side, and on the\nother the _triclinium_ or supper-room, backing the shop. Jucundus had been\npleasantly engaged in a small supper-party; and, mindful that a\n_symposium_ should lie within the number of the Graces and of the Muses,\nhe had confined his guests to two, the young Greek Aristo, who was one of\nhis principal artists, and Cornelius the son of a freedman of a Roman of\ndistinction, who had lately got a place in one of the _scrinia_ of the\nproconsular _officium_, and had migrated into the province from the\nimperial city where he had spent his best days.\n\nThe dinner had not been altogether suitable to modern ideas of good\nliving. The grapes from Tacape, and the dates from the lake Tritonis, the\nwhite and black figs, the nectarines and peaches, and the watermelons,\naddress themselves to the imagination of an Englishman, as well as of an\nAfrican of the third century. So also might the liquor derived from the\nsap or honey of the Getulian palm, and the sweet wine, called _melilotus_,\nmade from the poetical fruit found upon the coast of the Syrtis. He would\nhave been struck, too, with the sweetness of the mutton; but he would have\nasked what the sheep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tails were before he tasted them, and found how\nlike marrow the firm substance ate of which they consisted. He would have\nfelt he ought to admire the roes of mullets, pressed and dried, from\nMauritania; but he would have thought twice before he tried the lion\ncutlets though they had the flavour of veal, and the additional _go\u00c3\u00bbt_ of\nbeing imperial property, and poached from a preserve. But when he saw the\nindigenous dish, the very haggis and cock-a-leekie of Africa, in the shape\nof\u00e2\u0080\u0094(alas! alas! it _must_ be said, with whatever apology for its\nintroduction)\u00e2\u0080\u0094in shape, then, of a delicate puppy, served up with\ntomatoes, with its head between its fore-paws, we consider he would have\nrisen from the unholy table, and thought he had fallen upon the\nhospitality of some sorceress of the neighbouring forest. However, to that\nfestive board our Briton was not invited, for he had some previous\nengagement that evening, either of painting himself with woad, or of\nhiding himself to the chin in the fens; so that nothing occurred to\ndisturb the harmony of the party, and the good humour and easy\nconversation which was the effect of such excellent cheer.\n\nCornelius had been present at the Secular Games in the foregoing year, and\nwas full of them, of Rome, and of himself in connection with it, as became\nso genuine a cockney of the imperial period. He was full of the high\npatriotic thoughts which so solemn a celebration had kindled within him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO great Rome!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou art first, and there is no second. In that\nwonderful pageant which these eyes saw last year was embodied her majesty,\nwas promised her eternity. We die, she lives. I say, _let_ a man die. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwell for him to take hemlock, or open a vein, after having seen the\nSecular Games. What was there to live for? I felt it; life was gone; its\nbest gifts flat and insipid after that great day. Excellent\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tauromenian, I\nsuppose? We know it in Rome. Fill up my cup. I drink to the genius of the\nemperor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was full of his subject, and soon resumed it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFancy the Campus Martius\nlighted up from one end to the other. It was the finest thing in the\nworld. A large plain, covered, not with streets, not with woods, but\nbroken and crossed with superb buildings in the midst of groves, avenues\nof trees, and green grass, down to the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing that\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. Do you want the grandest temples in the world, the most\nspacious porticoes, the longest racecourses? there they are. Do you want\n_gymnasia_? there they are. Do you want arches, statues, obelisks? you\nfind them there. There you have at one end the stupendous mausoleum of\nAugustus, cased with white marble, and just across the river the huge\ntowering mound of Hadrian. At the other end you have the noble Pantheon of\nAgrippa, with its splendid Syracusan columns, and its dome glittering with\nsilver tiles. Hard by are the baths of Alexander, with their beautiful\ngroves. Ah! my good friend! I shall have no time to drink if I go on.\nBeyond are the numerous chapels and fanes which fringe the base of the\nCapitoline hill; the tall column of Antoninus comes next, with its\nadjacent basilica, where is kept the authentic list of the provinces of\nthe empire, and of the governors, each a king in power and dominion, who\nare sent out to them. Well, I am now only beginning. Fancy, I say, this\nmagnificent region all lighted up; every temple to and fro, every bath,\nevery grove, gleaming with innumerable lamps and torches. No, not even the\ngods of Olympus have anything that comes near it. Rome is the greatest of\nall divinities. In the dead of night all was alive; then it was, when\nnature sleeps exhausted, Rome began the solemn sacrifices to commemorate\nher thousand years. On the banks of the Tiber, which had seen \u00c3\u0086neas land,\nand Romulus ascend to the gods, the clear red flame shot up as the victims\nburned. The music of ten thousand horns and flutes burst forth, and the\nsacred dances began upon the greensward. I am too old to dance; but, I\nprotest, even I stood up and threw off. We danced through three nights,\ndancing the old millenary out, dancing the new millenary in. We were all\nRomans, no strangers, no slaves. It was a solemn family feast, the feast\nof all the Romans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we came in for the feast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor Caracalla gave Roman\ncitizenship to all freemen all over the world. We are all of us Romans,\nrecollect, Cornelius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! that was another matter\u00e2\u0080\u0094a condescension,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Cornelius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\nin a certain sense, I grant it; but it was a political act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI warrant you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost political. We were to be fleeced,\ndo you see? so your imperial government made us Romans, that we might have\nthe taxes of Romans, and that in addition to our own. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taxed us\ndouble; and as for the privilege of citizenship, much it is, by Hercules,\nwhen every snob has it who can wear a _pileus_ or cherish his hair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! but you should have seen the procession from the Capitol,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued\nCornelius, \u00e2\u0080\u009con, I think, the second day; from the Capitol to the Circus,\nall down the Via Sacra. Hosts of strangers there, and provincials from the\nfour corners of the earth, but not in the procession. There you saw, all\nin one _coup-d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c5\u0093il_, the real good blood of Rome, the young blood of the\nnew generation, and promise of the future; the sons of patrician and\nconsular families, of imperators, orators, conquerors, statesmen. They\nrode at the head of the procession, fine young fellows, six abreast; and\nstill more of them on foot. Then came the running horses and the chariots,\nthe boxers, the wrestlers, and other combatants, all ready for the\ncompetition. The whole school of gladiators then turned out, boys and all,\nwith their masters, dressed in red tunics, and splendidly armed. They\nformed three bands, and they went forward gaily, dancing and singing the\nPyrrhic. By-the-bye, a thousand pair of gladiators fought during the\ngames\u00e2\u0080\u0094a round thousand, and such clean-made, well-built fellows, and they\ncame against each other so gallantly! You should have seen it; _I_ can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go\nthrough it. There was a lot of satyrs, jumping and frisking, in burlesque\nof the martial dances which preceded them. There was a crowd of trumpeters\nand horn-blowers; ministers of the sacrifices with their victims, bulls\nand rams, dressed up with gay wreaths; drivers, butchers, haruspices,\nheralds; images of gods with their cars of ivory or silver, drawn by tame\nlions and elephants. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recollect the order. O! but the grandest\nthing of all was the Carmen, sung by twenty-seven noble youths, and as\nmany noble maidens, taken for the purpose from the bosoms of their\nfamilies to propitiate the gods of Rome. The flamens, augurs, colleges of\npriests, it was endless. Last of all came the emperor himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the late man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhilip; no bad riddance his\ndeath, if all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll emperors are good in their time and way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Cornelius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhilip\nwas good then, and Decius is good now;\u00e2\u0080\u0094whom the gods preserve!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand; an emperor cannot do wrong, except in\ndying, and then everything goes wrong with him. His death is his first bad\ndeed; he ought to be ashamed of it; it somehow turns all his great virtues\ninto vices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! no one was so good an emperor as our man, Gordianus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ca princely old man, living and dead; patron of trade and of the arts;\nsuch villas! he had enormous revenues. Poor old gentleman! and his son\ntoo. I never shall forget the day when the news came that he was gone. Let\nme see, it was shortly after that old fool Strabo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean my\nbrother; a good thirteen years ago. All Africa was in tears; there was no\none like Gordianus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old world philosophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cJucundus, you must go to\nschool. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see that all that is, is right; and all that was, is\nwrong? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Te nos facimus, Fortuna, deam,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says your poet; well, I drink \u00e2\u0080\u0098to\nthe fortunes of Rome,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094while it lasts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Cornelius, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very young man, and a Greek.\nGreeks never understand Rome. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most difficult to understand us. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nscience. Look at this medal, young gentleman; it was one of those struck\nat the games. Is it not grand? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Novum s\u00c3\u00a6culum,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and on the reverse,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00c3\u0086ternitati.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Always changing, always imperishable. Emperors rise and\nfall; Rome remains. The eternal city! Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this good philosophy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, a most beautiful medal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, examining it, and handing it\non to his host. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might make an amulet of it, Jucundus. But as to\neternity, why, that is a very great word; and, if I mistake not, other\nstates have been eternal before Rome. Ten centuries is a very respectable\neternity; be content, Rome is eternal already, and may die without\nprejudice to the medal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlaspheme not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Cornelius: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome is healthier, more full of life,\nand promises more, than at any former time, you may rely upon it. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Novum\ns\u00c3\u00a6culum!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she has the age of the eagle, and will but cast her feathers to\nbegin a fresh thousand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Egypt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interposed Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif old Herodotus speaks true, scarcely\nhad a beginning. Up and up, the higher you go, the more dynasties of\nEgyptian kings do you find. And we hear strange reports of the nations in\nthe far east, beyond the Ganges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I tell you, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rejoined Cornelius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome is a city of kings. That\none city, in this one year, has as many kings at once as those of all the\nkings of all the dynasties of Egypt put together. Sesostris, and the rest\nof them, what are they to imperators, prefects, proconsuls, _vicarii_, and\n_rationales_? Look back at Lucullus, C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Pompey, Sylla, Titus, Trajan.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old Cheops\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pyramid to the Flavian amphitheatre? What is the\nmany-gated Thebes to Nero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s golden house, while it was? What the grandest\npalace of Sesostris or Ptolemy but a second-rate villa of any one of ten\nthousand Roman citizens? Our houses stand on acres of ground, they ascend\nas high as the Tower of Babylon; they swarm with columns like a forest;\nthey pullulate into statues and pictures. The walls, pavements, and\nceilings are dazzling from the lustre of the rarest marble, red and\nyellow, green and mottled. Fountains of perfumed water shoot aloft from\nthe floor, and fish swim in rocky channels round about the room, waiting\nto be caught and killed for the banquet. We dine; and we feast on the head\nof the ostrich, the brains of the peacock, the liver of the bream, the\nmilk of the murena, and the tongue of the flamingo. A flight of doves,\nnightingales, beccaficoes are concentrated into one dish. On great\noccasions we eat a ph\u00c5\u0093nix. Our saucepans are of silver, our dishes of\ngold, our vases of onyx, and our cups of precious stones. Hangings and\ncarpets of Tyrian purple are around us and beneath us, and we lie on ivory\ncouches. The choicest wines of Greece and Italy crown our goblets, and\nexotic flowers crown our heads. In come troops of dancers from Lydia, or\npantomimes from Alexandria, to entertain both eye and mind; or our noble\ndames and maidens take a place at our tables; they wash in asses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 milk,\nthey dress by mirrors as large as fish-ponds, and they glitter from head\nto foot with combs, brooches, necklaces, collars, ear-rings, armlets,\nbracelets, finger-rings, girdles, stomachers, and anklets, all of diamond\nand emerald. Our slaves may be counted by thousands, and they come from\nall parts of the world. Everything rare and precious is brought to Rome:\nthe gum of Arabia, the nard of Assyria, the papyrus of Egypt, the\ncitron-wood of Mauretania, the bronze of \u00c3\u0086gina, the pearls of Britain, the\ncloth of gold of Phrygia, the fine webs of Cos, the embroidery of Babylon,\nthe silks of Persia, the lion-skins of Getulia, the wool of Miletus, the\nplaids of Gaul. Thus we live, an imperial people, who do nothing but enjoy\nthemselves and keep festival the whole year; and at length we die\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then\nwe burn: we burn\u00e2\u0080\u0094in stacks of cinnamon and cassia, and in shrouds of\n_asbestos_, making emphatically a good end of it. Such are we Romans, a\ngreat people. Why, we are honoured wherever we go. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my master,\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s myself; as we came here from Italy, I protest we were nearly\nworshipped as demi-gods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd perhaps some fine morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome herself will burn in\ncinnamon and cassia, and in all her burnished Corinthian brass and scarlet\nbravery, the old mother following her children to the funeral pyre. One\nhas heard something of Babylon, and its drained moat, and the soldiers of\nthe Persian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA pause occurred in the conversation as one of Jucundus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slaves entered\nwith fresh wine, larger goblets, and a vase of snow from the Atlas.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER VI.\n\n\n                          GOTHS AND CHRISTIANS.\n\n\nCornelius was full of his subject, and did not attend to the Greek. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nwild-beasts hunts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cah, those hunts during the games,\nAristo! they were a spectacle for the gods. Twenty-two elephants, ten\npanthers, ten hy\u00c3\u00a6nas (by-the-bye, a new beast, not strange, however, to\nyou here, I suppose), ten camelopards, a hippopotamus, a rhinoceros\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through the list. Fancy the circus planted throughout for the\noccasion, and turned into a park, and then another set of wild animals,\nGetes and Sarmatians, Celts and Goths, sent in against them, to hunt down,\ncapture and kill them, or to be killed themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, the Goths!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose fellows give you trouble, though,\nnow and then. Perhaps they will give you more. There is a report in the\npr\u00c3\u00a6torium to-day that they have crossed the Danube.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, they _will_ give us trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius, drily; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey _have_\ngiven us trouble, and they will give us more. The Samnites gave us\ntrouble, and our friends of Carthage here, and Jugurtha, and Mithridates;\ntrouble, yes, that is the long and the short of it; they will give us\ntrouble. Is trouble a new thing to Rome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, stretching out his\narm, as if he were making a speech after dinner, and giving a toast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Goths give trouble, and take a bribe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is what\ntrouble means in their case: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a troublesome fellow who hammers at our\ndoor till we pay his reckoning. It is troublesome to raise the means to\nbuy them off. And the example of these troublesome savages is catching; it\nwas lately rumoured that the Carpians had been asking the same terms for\nkeeping quiet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would ill become the majesty of Rome to soil her fingers with the\nblood of such vermin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe ignores them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd therefore she most majestically bleeds us instead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Aristo,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she may have treasure to give them. We are not so troublesome as\nthey; the more\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pity. No offence to you, however, or to the emperor,\nor to great Rome, Cornelius. We are over our cups; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a game of\npolitics, you know, like chess or the _cottabus_. Maro bids you \u00e2\u0080\u0098parcere\nsubjectis, et debellare superbos;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but you have changed your manners. You\ncoax the Goths and bully the poor African.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfrica can show fight, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interposed Jucundus, who had been calmly\nlistening and enjoying his own wine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitness Thysdrus. That was giving\nevery rapacious Qu\u00c3\u00a6stor a lesson that he may go too far, and find a dagger\nwhen he demands a purse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was alluding to the revolt of Africa, which led to the downfall of the\ntyrant Maximin and the exaltation of the Gordians, when the native\nlandlords armed their peasantry, killed the imperial officer, and raised\nthe standard of rebellion in the neighbouring town from impatience of\nexactions under which they suffered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo offence, I say, Cornelius, no offence to eternal Rome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you have explained to us why you weigh so heavy on us. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always\nheard it was a fortune at Rome for a man to have found out a new tax.\nVespasian did his best; but now you tax our smoke, and our very shadow;\nand Pescennius threatened to tax the air we breathe. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll play at\nriddles, and you shall solve the following:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Say who is she that eats her\nown limbs, and grows eternal upon them? Ah, the Goths will take the\nmeasure of her eternity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Goths!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, who was warming into conversational life, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nGoths! no fear of the Goths; but,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he nodded significantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at\nhome; we have more to fear indoors than abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe means the pr\u00c3\u00a6torians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius to Aristo, condescendingly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ngrant you that there have been several untoward affairs; we have had our\nproblem, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a thing of the past, it never can come again. I venture\nto say that the power of the pr\u00c3\u00a6torians is at an end. That murder of the\ntwo emperors the other day was the worst job they ever did; it has turned\nthe public opinion of the whole world against them. I have no fear of the\npr\u00c3\u00a6torians.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean pr\u00c3\u00a6torians more than Goths,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno, give me the\nold weapons, the old maxims of Rome, and I defy the scythe of Saturn. Do\nthe soldiers march under the old ensign? do they swear by the old gods? do\nthey interchange the good old signals and watchwords? do they worship the\nfortune of Rome; then I say we are safe. But do we take to new ways? do we\ntrifle with religion? do we make light of Jupiter, Mars, Romulus, the\naugurs, and the ancilia? then I say, not all our shows and games, our\nelephants, hy\u00c3\u00a6nas, and hippopotamuses, will do us any good. It was not the\nbest thing, no, not the best thing that the soldiers did, when they\ninvested that Philip with the purple. But he is dead and gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he sat\nup and leant on his elbow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! but it will be all set right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll_ see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a reformer, that Philip,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand put down an\nenormity. Well, they call it an enormity; let it be an enormity. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d put\nit down; but why? there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point; why? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his\nvoice grew angry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat that hoary-headed Atheist Fabian was at the bottom\nof it; Fabian, the Christian. I hate reforms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, we had long wished to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Cornelius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut could not\nmanage it. Alexander attempted it near twenty years ago. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\nphilosophers have always aimed at.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gods consume philosophers and the Christians together!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus\ndevoutly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little to choose between them, except that the\nChristians are the filthier animal of the two. But both are ruining the\nmost glorious political structure that the world ever saw. I am not\nover-fond of Alexander either.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you in the name of philosophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Greek.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd thank you in the name of the Christians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d chimed in Juba.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first word that hopeful youth has\nspoken since he came in, and he takes on him to call himself a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a right to do so, if I choose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a right to be a\nChristian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight! O yes, right! ha, ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cright! Jove help the\nlad! by all manner of means. Of course, you have a right to go _in malam\nrem_ in whatever way you please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am my own master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy father was a Christian. I suppose it\ndepends on myself to follow him or not, according to my fancy, and as long\nas I think fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFancy! think fit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou pompous little mule! Yes, go\nand be a Christian, my dear child, as your doting father went. Go, like\nhim, to the priest of their mysteries; be spit on, stripped, dipped; feed\non little boys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 marrow and brains; worship the ass; and learn all the foul\nmagic of the sect. And then be delated and taken up, and torn to shreds on\nthe rack, or thrown to the lions and so go to Tartarus, if Tartarus there\nbe, in the way you think fit. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll harm none but yourself, my boy. I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fear such as you, but the deeper heads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJuba stood up with a look of offended dignity, and, as on former\noccasions, tossed the head which had been by implication disparaged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ndespise you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but you are hard on the Christians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard\nthem maintain that their superstition, if adopted, would be the salvation\nof Rome. They maintain that the old religion is gone or going out; that\nsomething new is wanted to keep the empire together; and that their\nworship is just fitted to the times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I say to the vipers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let well alone. We did\nwell enough without you; we did well enough till you sprang up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A plague\non their insolence; as if Jew or Egyptian could do aught for us when Numa\nand the Sibyl fail. That is what I say, Let Rome be true to herself and\nnothing can harm her; let her shift her foundation, and I would not buy\nher for this water-melon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, taking a suck at it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome alone can\nharm Rome. Recollect old Horace, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He was\na prophet. If she falls, it is by her own hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly, to set up any new worship is\ntreason; not a doubt of it. The gods keep us from such ingratitude! We\nhave grown great by means of them, and they are part and parcel of the law\nof Rome. But there is no great chance of our forgetting this; Decius\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact. You will see. Time will show; perhaps to-morrow,\nperhaps next day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, mysteriously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy in the world should you have this frantic dread of these poor\nscarecrows of Christians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009call because they hold an opinion?\nWhy are you not afraid of the bats and the moles? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opinion: there\nhave been other opinions before them, and there will be other opinions\nafter. Let them alone and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll die away; make a hubbub about them and\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpread?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus, who was under the twofold excitement of personal\nfeeling and of wine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspread, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spread? yes, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spread. Yes,\ngrow, like scorpions, twenty at a birth. The country already swarms with\nthem; they are as many as frogs or grasshoppers; they start up everywhere\nunder one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose, when one least expects them. The air breeds them like\nplague-flies; the wind drifts them like locusts. No one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe; any one\nmay be a Christian; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an epidemic. Great Jove! _I_ may be a Christian\nbefore I know where I am. Heaven and earth! is it not monstrous?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncontinued, with increasing fierceness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Jucundus, my poor man, you\nmay wake and find yourself a Christian, without knowing it, against your\nwill. Ah! my friends, pity me! I may find myself a beast, and obliged to\nsuck blood and live among the tombs as if I liked it, without power to\ntell you how I loathe it, all through their sorcery. By the genius of Rome\nsomething must be done. I say, no one is safe. You call on your friend; he\nis sitting in the dark, unwashed, uncombed, undressed. What is the matter?\nAh! his son has turned Christian. Your wedding-day is fixed, you are\nexpecting your bride; she does not come; why? she will not have you; she\nhas become a Christian. Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s young Nomentanus? Who has seen Nomentanus?\nin the forum, or the campus, in the circus, in the bath? Has he caught the\nplague or got a sunstroke? Nothing of the kind; the Christians have caught\nhold of him. Young and old, rich and poor, my lady in her litter and her\nslave, modest maid and Lydia at the Therm\u00c3\u00a6, nothing comes amiss to them.\nAll confidence is gone; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one we can reckon on. I go to my\ntailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nergal,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I say to him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nergal, I want a new tunic,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The\nwretched hypocrite bows, and runs to and fro, and unpacks his stuffs and\ncloths, like another man. A word in your ear. The man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Christian,\ndressed up like a tailor. They have no dress of their own. If I were\nemperor, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make the sneaking curs wear a badge, I would; a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collar,\na fox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail, or a pair of ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears. Then we should know friends from\nfoes when we meet them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should think that dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius; \u00e2\u0080\u009chowever, you are taking\nit too much to heart; you are making too much of them, my good friend.\nThey have not even got the present, and you are giving them the future,\nwhich is just what they want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Jucundus will listen to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could satisfy him that\nthe Christians are actually falling off. They once were numerous in this\nvery place; now there are hardly any. They have been declining for these\nfifty years; the danger from them is past. Do you want to know how to\nrevive them? Put out an imperial edict, forbid them, denounce them. Do you\nwant them to drop away like autumn leaves? Take no notice of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny that in Italy they _have_ grown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\n_have_ grown in numbers and in wealth, and they intermarry with us. Thus\nthe upper class becomes to a certain extent infected. We may find it\nnecessary to repress them; but, as you would repress vermin, without\nfearing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe worshippers of the gods are the many, and the Christians are the\nfew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d persisted Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the two parties intermarry, the weaker will\nget the worst of it. You will find the statues of the gods gradually\ncreeping back into the Christian chapel; and a man must be an honest\nfellow who buys our images, eh, Jucundus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Aristo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the paterfamilias, whose violence never lasted long,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cif your sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bright eyes win back my poor Agellius you will have\nsomething more to say for yourself than, at present, I grant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius, gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI begin to understand it. I could not\nmake out why our good host had such great fear for the stability of Rome.\nBut it is one of those things which the experience of life has taught me.\nI have often seen it in the imperial city itself. Whenever you find a man\nshow special earnestness against these fanatics, depend on it there is\nsomething that touches him personally in the matter. There was a very\ngreat man, the present Flamen Dialis, for whom I have unbounded respect;\nfor a long time I was at a loss to conceive why a person of his weight,\nsound, sensible, well-judging, should have such a fear of the Christians.\nOne day he made an oration against them in the senate-house; he wanted to\nsend them to the rack. But the secret came out; the good man was on the\nrack himself about his daughter, who persisted in calling herself a\nChristian, and refused to paint her face or go to the amphitheatre. To be\nsure, a most trying affair this for the old gentleman. The venerable Pater\nPatratus, too, what suppers he gave! a fine specimen of the Lucullus type;\nyet he was always advocating the lictor and the _commentariensis_ in the\ninstance of the Christian. No wonder; his wife and son were disgracing him\nin the eyes of the whole world by frequenting the meetings of these\nChristians. However, I agree with Decius, they must be put down. They are\nnot formidable, but they are an eyesore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the rushing of the water-clock which measured time in the\nneighbouring square, ceased, signifying thereby that the night was getting\non. Juba had already crept into the dark closet which served him for a\nsleeping-place; had taken off his sandals, and loosened his belt; had\nwrapt the serpent he had about him round his neck, and was breathing\nheavily. Jucundus made the parting libation, and Cornelius took his leave.\nAristo rose too; and Jucundus, accompanying them to the entrance, paid the\nnot uncommon penalty of his potations, for the wine mounted to his head,\nand he returned into the room, and sat him down again with an impression\nthat Aristo was still at table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius is but a wet Christian; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all, not\nobstinate, like his brother there. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas his father; the less we say about\nhim the better; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone. The Furies make his bed for him! an odious set!\nTheir priests, little ugly men. I saw one when I was a boy at Carthage. So\nunlike your noble Roman Saliares, or your fine portly priest of Isis, clad\nin white, breathing odours like spring flowers; men who enjoyed this life,\nnot like that sour hypocrite. He was as black as an Ethiopian, and as\nwithered as a Saracen, and he never looked you in the face. And, after\nall, the fellow must die for his religion, rather than put a few grains of\ngolden incense on the altar of great Jove. Jove\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the god for me; a\nglorious, handsome, curly god\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they are all good, all the gods are\ngood. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bacchus, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good, comfortable god, though a sly,\ntreacherous fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0094a treacherous fellow. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ceres, too; Pomona; the\nMuses; Astarte, too, as they call her here; all good;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Apollo, though\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat too hot in this season, and too free with his bow. He gave\nme a bad fever once. Ah! life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precious, most precious; so I felt it\nthen, when I was all but gone to Pluto. Life never returns, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like\nwater spilt; you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gather it up. It is dispersed into the elements, to\nthe four winds. Ah! there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something more there than I can tell; more\nthan all your philosophers can determine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seemed to think awhile, and began again: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnjoyment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the great rule;\nask yourself, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Have I made the most of things?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I say to the\nrising generation. Many and many\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time when I have not turned them to\nthe best account. Oh, if I had now to begin life again, how many things\nshould I correct! I might have done better this evening. Those abominable\npears! I might have known they would not be worth the eating. Mutton, that\nwas all well; doves, good again; crane, kid; well, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that I\ncould have done much better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a few minutes he got up half asleep, and put out all the lights but\none small lamp, with which he made his way into his own bed-closet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll\nis vanity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, with a slow, grave utterance, \u00e2\u0080\u009call is vanity but\neating and drinking. It does not pay to serve the gods except for this.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fame? what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glory? what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power? smoke. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often thought the hog\nis the only really wise animal. We should be happier if we were all hogs.\nHogs keep the end of life steadily in view; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why those toads of\nChristians will not eat them, lest they should get like them. Quiet,\nrespectable, sensible enjoyment; not riot, or revel, or excess, or\nquarrelling. Life is short.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And with this undeniable sentiment he fell\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER VII.\n\n\n                        PERSECUTION IN THE OFFING.\n\n\nNext morning, as Jucundus was dusting and polishing his statues and other\narticles of taste and devotion, supplying the gaps in their ranks, and\ngrouping a number of new ones which had come in from his workmen, Juba\nstrutted into the shop, and indulged himself from time to time in an\ninward laugh or snigger at the various specimens of idolatry which grinned\nor frowned or frisked or languished on all sides of him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sneer at that Anubis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his uncle; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the work of the\ndivine Callista.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat, I suppose, is why she brings into existence so many demons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nanswered Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing more can be done in the divine line; like the\nqueen who fell in love with a baboon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I come to think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat god of hers is something\nlike _you_. She must be in love with you, Juba.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe youth, as was usual with him, tossed his head with an air of lofty\ndispleasure; at length he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why should she not fall in love with\nme, pray?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, because you are too good or too bad to need her plastic hand. She\ncould not make anything out of you. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Non ex quovis ligno.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be\ndoing a good work if she wiled back your brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_He_ does not want wiling any more than I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_I_ dare say!\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his uncle, looking round at him in surprise; \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius\nno Christian?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a bit of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009crest assured. I taxed him with it only\nlast night; let him alone, _he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll_ come round. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too proud to change,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all. Preach to him, entreat him, worry him, try to turn him, work\nat the bit, whip him, and he will turn restive, start aside, or run away;\nbut let him have his head, pretend not to look, seem indifferent to the\nwhole matter, and he will quietly sit down in the midst of your images\nthere. Callista has an easy task; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bribe him to do what he would\nelse do for nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very best news I have heard since your silly old father died,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nJucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe very best\u00e2\u0080\u0094if true. Juba, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you an handsome present\nthe first sow your brother sacrifices to Ceres. Ha, ha, what fine fun to\nsee the young farmer over his cups at the Nundin\u00c3\u00a6! Ha, ha, no Christian!\nbravo, Juba! ha, ha, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make you a present, I say, an Apollo to teach\nyou manners, or a Mercury to give you wit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009che would not be thinking of Callista, if he\nwere thinking of his saints and angels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa, ha! to be sure!\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be sure! yet why shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he\nworship a handsome Greek girl as well as any of those mummies and death\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nheads and bogies of his, which I should blush to put up here alongside\neven of Anubis, or a scarab\u00c3\u00a6us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother thinks she is not altogether the girl you take her for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his\nnephew.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matter, no matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno matter at all; she may be a\nLais or Phryne for me; the surer to make a man of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmother thinks her head is turning in the opposite way.\nD\u00e2\u0080\u0099you see? Strange, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, annoyed himself yet not unwilling\nto annoy his uncle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Jucundus, making a wry face and looking round at him, as\nif to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat on earth is going to turn up now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo tell the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, gloomily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did once think of her myself.\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see why I have not as much right to do so as Agellius, if I\nplease. So I thought old mother might do something for me; and I asked her\nfor a charm or love potion, which would bring her from her brother down to\nthe forest yonder. Gurta took to it kindly, for she has a mortal hatred of\nCallista, because of her good looks, though she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say so, and because\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Greek! and she liked the notion of humbling the haughty minx. So\nshe began one of the most tremendous spells,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shrieked out with a\nlaugh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the most tremendous spells in her whole budget. All and\neverything in the most exact religious way: wine, milk, blood, meal, wax,\nold rags, gods, Numidian as well as Punic; such names; one must be\nbarbarian to boot, as well as witch, to pronounce them: a score of things\nthere were besides. And then to see the old woman, with her streaming grey\nhair, twinkling eyes, and grim look, twirl about as some flute girl at a\nbanquet; it was enough to dance down, not only the moon, but the whole\nmilky way. But it did not dance down Callista; at which mother got savage,\nand protested that Callista was a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJucundus looked much perplexed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedius fidius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, unless we\nlook sharp, she will be converting him the wrong way;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he began pacing\nup and down the small room.\n\nJuba on his part began singing\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGurta the witch would have part in the jest;\n  Though lame as a gull, by his highness possessed,\n  She shouldered her crutch, and danced with the rest.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSporting and snorting, deep in the night,\n  Their beards flashing fire, and their hoofs striking light,\n  And their tails whisking round in the heat of their flight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time Jucundus had recovered from the qualm which Juba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nintelligence had caused him, and he cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCease your rubbish; old\nGurta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jealous; I know her spite; Christian is the most blackguard word\nin her vocabulary, its Barbar for toad or adder. I see it all; no,\nCallista, the divine Callista, must take in hand this piece of wax, sing a\ncharm, and mould him into a Vertumnus. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show herself the more potent\nwitch of the two. The new emperor too will help the incantation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! something is coming?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Juba, with a grin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cComing, boy? yes, I warrant you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his uncle. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll_ make them\nsqueak. If gentle means don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do, then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just throw in another\ningredient or two: an axe, or a wild cat, or a firebrand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care what you are about, if you deal with Agellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sawney, but you must not drive him to bay. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t threaten; keep to\nthe other line; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weak-hearted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly as a background to bring out the painting; the Muse singing, all in\nlight, relieved by sardix or sepia. It _must_ come; but perhaps Agellius\nwill come first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nIt was indeed as Jucundus had hinted; a new policy, a new era was coming\nupon Christianity, together with the new emperor. Christians had hitherto\nbeen for the most part the objects of popular fury rather than of imperial\njealousy. Nero, indeed, from his very love of cruelty, had taken pleasure\nin torturing them: but statesmen and philosophers, though at times\nperplexed and inconsistent, yet on the whole had despised them; and the\nsuperstition of priests and people, with their \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristianos ad leones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhad been the most formidable enemy of the faith. Accordingly, atrocious as\nthe persecution had been at times, it had been conducted on no plan, and\nhad been local and fitful. But even this trial had been suspended, with\nbut few interruptions, during the last thirty, nay, fifty years. So\nfavourable a state of things had been more or less brought about by a\nsuccession of emperors, who had shown an actual leaning to Christianity.\nWhile the vigorous rule of the five good emperors, as they are called, had\nhad many passages in its history of an adverse character, those who\nfollowed after, being untaught in the traditions, and strangers to the\nspirit of old Rome, foreigners, or adventurers, or sensualists, were\nprotectors of the new religion. The favourite mistress of Commodus is even\nsaid to have been a Christian; so is the nurse of Caracalla. The wretched\nHeliogabalus, by his taste for Oriental superstitions, both weakened the\ninfluence of the established hierarchy, and encouraged the toleration of a\nfaith which came from Palestine. The virtuous Alexander, who followed him,\nwas a philosopher more than a statesman; and, in pursuance of the\nsyncretism which he had adopted, placed the images of Abraham and our Lord\namong the objects of devotion which his private chapel contained. What is\ntold us of the Emperor Philip is still more to the point: the gravest\nauthorities report that he was actually a Christian; and, since it cannot\nbe doubted that Christians were persuaded of the fact, the leaning of his\ngovernment must have been emphatically in their favour to account for such\na belief. In consequence, Christians showed themselves without fear; they\nemerged from the catacombs, and built churches in public view; and, though\nin certain localities, as in the instance of Africa, they had suffered\nfrom the contact of the world, they spread far and wide, and faith became\nthe instrument at least of political power, even where it was wanting in\ncharity, or momentarily disowned by cowardice. In a word, though Celsus a\nhundred years before had pronounced \u00e2\u0080\u009ca man weak who should hope to unite\nthe three portions of the earth in a common religion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that common\nCatholic faith had been found, and a principle of empire was created which\nhad never before existed. The phenomenon could not be mistaken; and the\nRoman statesman saw he had to deal with a rival. Nor must we suppose,\nbecause on the surface of the history we read so much of the vicissitudes\nof imperial power, and of the profligacy of its possessors, that the\nfabric of government was not sustained by traditions of the strongest\ntemper, and by officials of the highest sagacity. It was the age of\nlawyers and politicians; and they saw more and more clearly that if\nChristianity was not to revolutionize the empire, they must follow out the\nline of action which Trajan and Antoninus had pointed out.\n\nDecius then had scarcely assumed the purple, when he commenced that new\npolicy against the Church which was reserved to Diocletian, fifty years\nlater, to carry out to its own final refutation. He entered on his power\nat the end of the year 249; and on the January 20th following, the day on\nwhich the Church still celebrates the event, St. Fabian, Bishop of Rome,\nobtained the crown of martyrdom. He had been pope for the unusually long\nspace of fourteen years, having been elected in consequence of one of\nthose remarkable interpositions of Divine Providence of which we now and\nthen read in the first centuries of the Church. He had come up to Rome\nfrom the country, in order to be present at the election of a successor to\nPope Anteros. A dove was seen to settle on his head, and the assembly rose\nup and forced him, to his surprise, upon the episcopal throne. After\nbringing back the relics of St. Pontian, his martyred predecessor, from\nSardinia, and having become the apostle of great part of Gaul, he seemed\ndestined to end his history in the same happy quiet and obscurity in which\nhe had lived; but it did not become a pope of that primitive time to die\nupon his bed, and he was reserved at length to inaugurate in his own\nperson, as chief pastor of the Church, a fresh company of martyrs.\n\nSuddenly an edict appeared for the extermination of the name and religion\nof Christ. It was addressed to the proconsuls and other governors of\nprovinces; and alleged or implied that the emperors, Decius and his son,\nbeing determined to give peace to their subjects, found the Christians\nalone an impediment to the fulfilment of their purpose; and that, by\nreason of the enmity which those sectaries entertained towards the gods of\nRome,\u00e2\u0080\u0094an enmity which was bringing down upon the world multiplied\nmisfortunes. Desirous, then, above all things, of appeasing the divine\nanger, they made an irrevocable ordinance that every Christian, without\nexception of rank, sex, or age, should be obliged to sacrifice. Those who\nrefused were to be thrown into prison, and in the first instance submitted\nto moderate punishments. If they conformed to the established religion,\nthey were to be rewarded; if not, they were to be drowned, burned alive,\nexposed to the beasts, hung upon the trees, or otherwise put to death.\nThis edict was read in the camp of the pr\u00c3\u00a6torians, posted up in the\nCapitol, and sent over the empire by government couriers. The authorities\nin each province were themselves threatened with heavy penalties, if they\ndid not succeed in frightening or tormenting the Christians into the\nprofession of paganism.\n\nSt. Fabian, as we have said, was the first-fruits of the persecution, and\neighteen months passed before his successor could be appointed. In the\ncourse of the next two months St. Pionius was burned alive at Smyrna, and\nSt. Nestor crucified in Pamphylia. At Carthage some perplexity and delay\nwere occasioned by the absence of the proconsul. St. Cyprian, its bishop,\ntook advantage of the delay, and retired into a place of concealment. The\npopulace had joined with the imperial government in seeking his life, and\nhad cried out furiously in the circus, demanding him \u00e2\u0080\u009cad leonem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the\nlion. A panic seized the Christian body, and for a while there were far\nmore persons found to compromise their faith than to confess it. It seemed\nas if Aristo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anticipation was justified, that Christianity was losing\nits hold upon the mind of its subjects, and that nothing more was needed\nfor those who had feared it, than to let it die a natural death. And at\nSicca the Roman officials, as far as ever they dared, seemed to act on\nthis view. Here Christians did no harm, they made no show, and there was\nlittle or nothing in the place to provoke the anger of the mob or to\nnecessitate the interference of the magistrate. The proconsul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence\nfrom Carthage was both an encouragement and an excuse for delay; and hence\nit was that, though we are towards the middle of the year 250, and the\nedict was published at Rome at its commencement, the good people of Sicca\nhad, as we have said, little knowledge of what was taking place in the\npolitical world, and whispered about vague presages of an intended\nmeasure, which had been in some places in operation for many months.\nCommunication with the seat of government was not so very frequent or\nrapid in those days, and public curiosity had not been stimulated by the\nfacilities of gratifying it. And thus we must account for a phenomenon,\nwhich we uphold to be a fact in the instance of Sicca, in the early summer\nof A.D. 250, even though it prove unaccountable, and history has nothing\nto say about it, and in spite of the _Acta Diurna_.\n\nThe case, indeed, is different now. In these times, newspapers, railroads,\nand magnetic telegraphs make us independent of government messengers. The\nproceedings at Rome would have been generally and accurately known in a\nfew seconds; and then, by way of urging forward the magistracy, a question\nof course would have been asked in the parliament of Carthage by the\nmember for Sicca, or Laribus, or Thugga, or by some one of the pagani, or\ncountry party, whether the popular report was true, that an edict had been\npromulgated at Rome against the Christians, and what steps had been taken\nby the local authorities throughout the proconsulate to carry out its\nprovisions. And then the \u00e2\u0080\u009cColonia Siccensis\u00e2\u0080\u009d would have presented some\ngood or bad reason for the delay: that it arose from the absence of the\nproconsul from the seat of government, or from the unaccountable loss of\nthe despatch on its way from the coast; or, perhaps, on the other hand,\nthe under-secretary would have maintained, amid the cheers of his\nsupporters, that the edict had been promulgated and carried out at Sicca\nto the full, that crowds of Christians had at once sacrificed, and that,\nin short, there was no one to punish; assertions which at that moment were\ntoo likely to be verified by the event.\n\nIn truth, there were many reasons to make the magistrates, both Roman and\nnative, unwilling to proceed in the matter, till they were obliged. No\ndoubt they one and all detested Christianity, and would have put it down,\nif they could; but the question was, when they came to the point, _what_\nthey should put down. If, indeed, they could have got hold of the\nringleaders, the bishops of the Church, they would have tortured and\nsmashed them _con amore_, as you would kill a wasp; and with the greater\nwarmth and satisfaction, just because it was so difficult to get at them.\nThose bishops were a set of fellows as mischievous as they were cowardly;\nthey would not come out and be killed, but they skulked in the desert, and\nhid in masquerade. But why should gentlemen in office, opulent and happy,\nset about worrying a handful of idiots, old, or poor, or boys, or women,\nor obscure, or amiable and well-meaning men, who were but a remnant of a\nformer generation, and as little connected with the fanatics of Carthage,\nAlexandria, or Rome, as the English freemasons may seem to be with their\nnamesakes on the continent? True, Christianity was a secret society, and\nan illegal religion; but would it cease to be so when those harmless or\nrespectable inhabitants of the place had been mounted on the rack or the\ngibbet?\n\nAnd then, too, it was a most dangerous thing to open the door to popular\nexcitement;\u00e2\u0080\u0094who would be able to shut it? Once rouse the populace, and it\nwas all over with the place. It could not be denied that the bigoted and\nignorant majority, not only of the common people, but of the better\nclasses, was steeped in a bitter prejudice, and an intense, though latent,\nhatred of Christianity. Besides the antipathy which arose from the\nextremely different views of life and duty taken by pagans and Christians,\nwhich would give a natural impulse to persecution in the hearts of the\nformer, there were the many persons who wished to curry favour at Rome\nwith the government, and had an eye to preferment or reward. There was the\npagan interest, extended and powerful, of that numerous class which was\nattached to the established religions by habit, position, interest, or the\nprospect of advantage. There were all the great institutions or\nestablishments of the place; the law courts, the schools of grammar and\nrhetoric, the philosophic _exedr\u00c3\u00a6_ and lecture-rooms, the theatre, the\namphitheatre, the market\u00e2\u0080\u0094all were, for one reason or another, opposed to\nChristianity; and who could tell where they would stop in their onward\ncourse, if they were set in motion? \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuieta non movenda\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the motto of\nthe local government, native and imperial, and that the more, because it\nwas an age of revolutions, and they might be most unpleasantly compromised\nor embarrassed by the direction which the movement took. Besides, Decius\nwas not immortal; in the last twelve years eight emperors had been cut\noff, six of them in a few months; and who could tell but the successor of\nthe present might revert to the policy of Philip, and feel no thanks to\nthose who had suddenly left it for a policy of blood.\n\nIn this cautious course they would be powerfully supported by the\ninfluence of personal considerations. The Roman _officia_, the city\nmagistrates, the heads of the established religions, the lawyers, and the\nphilosophers, all would have punished the Christians, if they could; but\nthey could not agree whom to punish. They would have agreed with great\nsatisfaction, as we have said, to inflict condign and capital punishment\nupon the heads of the sect; and they would have had no objection, if\ndriven to do something, to get hold of some strangers or slaves, who might\nbe a sort of scapegoats for the rest; but it was impossible, when they\nonce began to persecute, to make distinctions, and not a few of them had\nrelations who were Christians, or at least were on that border-land which\nthe mob might mistake for the domain of Christianity\u00e2\u0080\u0094Marcionites,\nTertullianists, Montanists, or Gnostics. When once the cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe gods of\nRome\u00e2\u0080\u009d was fairly up, it would apply to tolerated religions as well as to\nillicit, and an unhappy votary of Isis or Mithras might suffer, merely\nbecause there were few Christians forthcoming. A duumvir of the place had\na daughter whom he had turned out of his house for receiving baptism, and\nwho had taken refuge at Vacca. Several of the decurions, the _tabularius_\nof the district, the _scriba_, one of the exactors, who lived in Sicca,\nvarious of the retired gentry, whom we spoke of in a former chapter, and\nvarious _attach\u00c3\u00a9s_ of the pr\u00c3\u00a6torium, were in not dissimilar circumstances.\nNay, the priest of Esculapius had a wife, whom he was very fond of, who,\nthough she promised to keep quiet, if things continued as they were,\nnevertheless had the madness to vow that, if there were any severe\nproceedings instituted against her people, she would at once come forward,\nconfess herself a Christian, and throw water, instead of incense, upon the\nsacrificial flame. Not to speak of the venerable man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenderness for her,\nsuch an exposure would seriously compromise his respectability, and, as he\nwas infirm and apoplectic, it was a question whether Esculapius himself\ncould save him from the shock which would be the consequence.\n\nThe same sort of feeling operated with our good friend Jucundus. He was\nattached to his nephew; but, be it said without disrespect to him, he was\nmore attached to his own reputation; and, while he would have been\nseriously annoyed at seeing Agellius exposed to one of the panthers of the\nneighbouring forest, or hung up by the feet, with the blood streaming from\nhis nose and mouth, as one of the dogs or kids of the market, he would\nhave disliked the _\u00c3\u00a9clat_ of the thing still more. He felt both anger and\nalarm at the prospect; he was conscious he did not understand his nephew,\nor (to use a common phrase) know where to find him; he was aware that a\ngreat deal of tact was necessary to manage him; and he had an instinctive\nfeeling that Juba was right in saying that it would not do to threaten him\nwith the utmost severity of the law. He considered Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold on him\nwas the most promising quarter of the horizon; so he came to a resolution\nto do as little as he could personally, but to hold Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, as\nfar as he could, steadily in the direction of that lady, and to see what\ncame of it. As to Juba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assurance that Agellius was not a Christian at\nheart, it was too good news to be true; but still it might be only an\nanticipation of what would be, when the sun of Greece shone out upon him,\nand dispersed the remaining mists of Oriental superstition.\n\nIn this state of mind the old gentleman determined one afternoon to leave\nhis shop to the care of a slave, and to walk down to his nephew, to judge\nfor himself of his state of mind; to bait his hook with Callista, and to\nsee if Agellius bit. There was no time to be lost, for the publication of\nthe edict might be made any day; and then disasters might ensue which no\nskill could remedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n                           THE NEW GENERATION.\n\n\nJucundus, then, set out to see how the land lay with his nephew, and to do\nwhat he could to prosper the tillage. His way led him by the temple of\nMercury, which at that time subserved the purpose of a boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school, and\nwas connected with some academical buildings, the property of the city,\nwhich lay beyond it. It cannot be said that our friend was any warm patron\nof literature or education, though he had not neglected the schooling of\nhis nephews. Letters seemed to him in fact to unsettle the mind; and he\nhad never known much good come of them. Rhetoricians and philosophers did\nnot know where they stood, or what were their bearings. They did not know\nwhat they held, and what they did not. He knew his own position perfectly\nwell, and, though the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cbelief\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cknowledge\u00e2\u0080\u009d did not come into his\nreligious vocabulary, he could at once, without hesitation, state what he\nprofessed and maintained. He stood upon the established order of things,\non the traditions of Rome, and the laws of the empire; but as to Greek\nsophists and declaimers, he thought very much as old Cato did about them.\nThe Greeks were a very clever people, unrivalled in the fine arts; let\nthem keep to their strong point; they were inimitable with the chisel, the\nbrush, the trowel, and the fingers; but he was not prepared to think much\nof their _calamus_ or _stylus_, poetry excepted. What did they ever do but\nsubvert received principles without substituting any others? And then they\nwere so likely to take some odd turn themselves; you never could be sure\nof them. Socrates, their patriarch, what was he after all but a culprit, a\nconvict, who had been obliged to drink hemlock, dying under the hands of\njustice? Was this a reputable end, a respectable commencement of the\nphilosophic family? It was very well for Plato or Xenophon to throw a veil\nof romance over the transaction, but this was the plain matter of fact.\nThen Anaxagoras had been driven out of Athens for his revolutionary\nnotions; and Diogenes had been accused, like the Christians, of atheism.\nThe case had been the same in more recent times. There had been that\nmadman, Apollonius, roaming about the world; Apuleius, too, their\nneighbour, fifty years before, a man of respectable station, a gentleman,\nbut a follower of the Greek philosophy, a dabbler in magic, and a\npretender to miracles. And so, in fact, of letters generally; as in their\nown country Minucius, a contemporary of Apuleius, became a Christian.\nSuch, too, had been his friend Octavius; such C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, who even became\none of the priests of the sect, and seduced others from the religion he\nhad left. One of them had been the public talk for several years, and he\ntoo originally a rhetorician, Thascius Cyprianus of Carthage. It was the\none thing which gave him some misgiving about that little Callista, that\nshe was a Greek.\n\nAs he passed the temple, the metal plate was sounding as a signal for the\ntermination of the school, and on looking towards the portico with an\nill-natured curiosity, he saw a young acquaintance of his, a youth of\nabout twenty, coming out of it, leading a boy of about half that age, with\nhis satchel thrown over his shoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Arnobius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d(2) he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow does rhetoric proceed? are we to take\nthe law line, or turn professor? Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the boy? some younger brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken pity on the little fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Arnobius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese\nschoolmasters are a savage lot. I suffered enough from them myself, and\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098miseris succurrere disco.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So I took him from under the roof of friend\nRupilius, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under my tutelage. How did he treat thee, boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe treated me like a slave or a Christian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe deserved it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll warrant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca pert, forward imp. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas\nGete against Briton. Much good comes of schooling! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wicked one\nalready. Ah, the new generation! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell the gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arnobius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat he did first to you, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the good gentleman says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst I did something to\nhim, and then he did something to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca sensible boy, after all; but the\nschoolmaster had the best of it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wager.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI grinned in his face, and he took off his wooden\nshoe, and knocked out one of my teeth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe justice of Pythagoras. Zaleuchus could not\nhave done better. The mouth sins, and the mouth suffers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI talked in school-time to my chum; and Rupilius\nput a gag in my jaws, and kept them open for an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very Rhadamanthus of schoolmasters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cand thereupon\nyou struck up a chant, divine though inarticulate, like the statue of\nMemnon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not say my Virgil, and he tore the shirt\nfrom off my back, and gave it me with the leather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098arma virumque\u00e2\u0080\u0099 branded on your hide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfterwards I ate his dinner for him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then he\nscrewed my head, and kept me without food for two days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour throat, you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca cautious man! lest you should\nsteal a draught or two of good strong air.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd lastly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not bring my pence, and then he tied my\nhands to a gibbet, and hung me up _in terrorem_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere I came in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arnobius; \u00e2\u0080\u009che seemed a pretty boy, so I cut him\ndown, paid his \u00c3\u00a6ra, and took him home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now he is your pupil?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Jucundus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Arnobius; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is still a day-scholar of the old\nwolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; one is like another; he could not change for the better: but I am\nhis bully, and shall tutorize him some day. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sharp lad, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he,\nFirmian?\u00e2\u0080\u009d turning to the boy; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great hand at composition for his years;\nbetter than I am, who never shall write Latin decently. Yet what can I do?\nI must profess and teach, for Rome is the only place for the law, and\nthese city professorships are not to be despised.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom are you attending here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Jucundus, drily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are the only man in Sicca who needs to ask the question. What! not\nknow the great Polemo of Rhodes, the friend of Plotinus, the pupil of\nTheagenes, the disciple of Thrasyllus, the hearer of Nicomachus, who was\nof the school of Secundus, the doctor of the new Pythagoreans? Not feel\nthe presence in Sicca of Polemo, the most celebrated, the most intolerable\nof men? That, however, is not his title, but the \u00e2\u0080\u0098godlike,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098oracular,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or the \u00e2\u0080\u0098portentous,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or something else as impressive. Every\none goes to him. He is the rage. I should not have a chance of success if\nI could not say that I had attended his lectures; though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be bound our\nlittle Firmian here would deliver as good. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the very cariophyllus of\nhuman nature. He comes to the schools in a litter of cedar, ornamented\nwith silver and covered with a lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin, slaves carrying him, and a\ncrowd of friends attending, with the state of a proconsul. He is dressed\nin the most exact style; his pallium is of the finest wool, white, picked\nout with purple; his tresses flow with unguent, his fingers glitter with\nrings, and he smells like Idalium. As soon as he puts foot on earth, a\ngreat hubbub of congratulation and homage breaks forth. He takes no\nnotice; his favourite pupils form a circle round him, and conduct him into\none of the _exedr\u00c3\u00a6_, till the dial shows the time for lecture. Here he\nsits in silence, looking at nothing, or at the wall opposite him, talking\nto himself, a hum of admiration filling the room. Presently one of his\npupils, as if he were pr\u00c3\u00a6co to the duumvir, cries out, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush, gentlemen,\nhush! the godlike\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, it is not that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve not got it. What _is_ his\ntitle? \u00e2\u0080\u0098the Bottomless,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0098the Bottomless speaks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A dead silence\nensues; a clear voice and a measured elocution are the sure token that it\nis the outpouring of the oracle. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pray,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says the little man, \u00e2\u0080\u0098pray, which\nexisted first, the egg or the chick? Did the chick lay the egg, or the egg\nhatch the chick?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then there ensues a whispering, a disputing, and after a\nwhile a dead silence. At the end of a quarter of an hour or so, our pr\u00c3\u00a6co\nspeaks again, and this time to the oracle. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bottomless man,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nhave to represent to you that no one of the present company finds himself\nequal to answer the question, which your condescension has proposed to our\nconsideration!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 On this there is a fresh silence, and at length a fresh\n_effatum_ from the hierophant: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Which comes first, the egg or the chick?\nThe egg comes first in relation to the causativity of the chick, and the\nchick comes first in relation to the causativity of the egg,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on which\nthere is a burst of applause; the ring of adorers is broken through, and\nthe shrinking professor is carried in the arms or on the shoulders of the\nliterary crowd to his chair in the lecture-room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMuch as there was in Arnobius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s description which gratified Jucundus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nprejudices, he had suspicions of his young acquaintance, and was not in\nthe humour to be pleased unreservedly with those who satirized anything\nwhatever that was established, or was appointed by government, even\naffectation and pretence. He said something about the wisdom of ages, the\nreverence due to authority, the institutions of Rome, and the magistrates\nof Sicca. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not go after novelties,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to Arnobius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake a daily\nlibation to Jove, the preserver, and to the genius of the emperor, and\nthen let other things take their course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean I must believe all this man says, because the\ndecurions have put him here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Arnobius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is this Polemo saying\nthat Proteus is matter, and that minerals and vegetables are his flock;\nthat Proserpine is the vital influence, and Ceres the efficacy of the\nheavenly bodies; that there are mundane spirits, and supramundane; and\nthen his doctrine about triads, monads, and progressions of the celestial\ngods?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey did not say so when I went to school; but keep\nto my rule, my boy, and swear by the genius of Rome and the emperor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in god or goddess, emperor or Rome, or in any philosophy,\nor in any religion at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arnobius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to desert the gods of your\nancestors?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAncestors?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arnobius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no ancestors. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not African certainly,\nnot Punic, not Liboph\u00c5\u0093nician, not Canaanite, not Numidian, not G\u00c3\u00a6tulian.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m half Greek, but what the other half is I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. My good old\ngaffer, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one of the old world. I believe nothing. Who can? There is\nsuch a racket and whirl of religions on all sides of me that I am sick of\nthe subject.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, the rising generation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d groaned Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou young men! I cannot\nprophesy what you will become, when we old fellows are removed from the\nscene. Perhaps you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a Christian?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nArnobius laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least I can give you comfort on that head, old\ngrandfather. A pretty Christian _I_ should make, indeed! seeing visions,\nto be sure, and rejoicing in the rack and dungeon! I wish to enjoy life; I\nsee wealth, power, rank, and pleasure to be worth living for, and I see\nnothing else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell said, my lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell said; stick to that. I declare\nyou frightened me. Give up all visions, speculations, conjectures,\nfancies, novelties, discoveries; nothing comes of them but confusion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the youth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not so wild as you seem to think,\nJucundus. It is true I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe one single word about the gods; but\nin their worship was I born, and in their worship I will die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdmirable!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus in a transport; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised; you have\ntaken me by surprise. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fine fellow; you are a boy after my heart.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a good mind to adopt you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe one syllable of all the priests\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trash,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nArnobius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho does? not they. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in Jupiter or Juno, or in\nAstarte or in Isis; but where shall I go for anything better? or why need\nI seek anything good or bad in that line? Nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known anywhere, and\nlife would go while I attempted what is impossible. No, better stay where\nI am; I may go further, and gain a loss for my pains. So you see I am for\nmyself, and for the genius of Rome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the true principle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the delighted Jucundus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\nreally, for so young a man, surprising! Where _did_ you get so much good\nsense, my dear fellow? _I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve_ seen very little of you. Well, this I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nsay, you are a youth of most mature mind. To be sure! Well! Such youths\nare rare now-a-days. I congratulate you with all my heart on your strong\nsense and your admirable wisdom. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have thought it? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always, to\ntell the truth, had a little suspicion of you; but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come out nobly.\nCapital! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish you to believe in the gods if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyour duty, dear boy, your duty to Rome to maintain them, and to rally\nround them when attacked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then with a changed voice, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, that\na young friend of mine had your view of the matter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then, fearing he\nhad said too much, he stopped abruptly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean Agellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arnobius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard, by-the-bye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncontinued in a lower tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the talk in the Capitol, that at Rome\nthey are proceeding on a new plan against the Christians with great\nsuccess. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put to death, at least at once; they keep in prison,\nand threaten the torture. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising how many come over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Furies seize them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Jucundus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey deserve everything bad,\nalways excepting my poor boy. So they are cheating the hangman by giving\nup their atheism, the vile reptiles, giving in to a threat. However,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish threats would answer with Agellius; but I greatly\nfear that menace would only make him stubborn. That stubbornness of a\nChristian! O Arnobius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, shaking his head and looking solemn,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a visitation from the gods, a sort of _nympholepsia_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arnobius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmark my words; the frenzy is dying. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nonly wonderful it should have lasted for three centuries. The report runs\nthat in some places, when the edict was published, the Christians did not\nwait for a summons, but swept up to the temples to sacrifice, like a shoal\nof tunnies. The magistrates were obliged to take so many a day; and, as\nthe days went on, none so eager to bring over the rest as those who have\nalready become honest men. Nay, not a few of their mystic or esoteric\nclass have conformed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf so, unless Agellius looks sharp,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis sect will give\nhim up before he gives up his sect. Christianity will be converted before\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fear for him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arnobius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew him at school. Boys\ndiffer; some are bold and open. They like to be men, and to dare the deeds\nof men; they talk freely, and take their swing in broad day. Others are\nshy, reserved, bashful, and are afraid to do what they love quite as much\nas the others. Agellius never could rub off this shame, and it has taken\nthis turn. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sure to outgrow it in a year or two. I should not wonder\nif, when once he had got over it, he went into the opposite fault. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nfind him a drinker and a swaggerer and a spendthrift before many years are\nover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, I am glad you think he\nwill shake off these fancies. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe they sit very close to him\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe walked on for a while in silence; then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat seems a sharp\nchild, Arnobius. Could he do me a service if I wanted it? Does he know\nAgellius?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnow him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes, and his farm too. He has rambled\nround Sicca, many is the mile. And he knows the short cuts, and the blind\nways, and safe circuits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Jucundus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirmian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Arnobius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirmian Lactantius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Firmian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere are you to be found of a\nday, my boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt class morning and afternoon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Firmian, \u00e2\u0080\u009csleeping in the\nporticoes in midday, nowhere in the evening, and roosting with Arnobius at\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you can keep a secret, should it so happen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand do\nan errand, if I gave you one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give him the stick worse than Rupilius, if he does not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nArnobius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA bargain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus; and, waving his hand to them, he stept\nthrough the city gate, and they returned to their afternoon amusements.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IX.\n\n\n                         JUCUNDUS BAITS HIS TRAP.\n\n\nAgellius is busily employed upon his farm. While the enemies of his faith\nare laying their toils for him and his brethren in the imperial city, in\nthe proconsular _officium_, and in the municipal curia,\u00e2\u0080\u0094while Jucundus is\nscheming against him personally in another way and with other\nintentions,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the unconscious object of these machinations is busy about his\nmaster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crops, housing the corn in caves or pits, distilling the roses,\nirrigating the _khennah_, and training and sheltering the vines. And he\ndoes so, not only from a sense of duty, but the more assiduously, because\nhe finds in constant employment a protection against himself, against idle\nthoughts, wayward wishes, discontent, and despondency. It is doubtless\nvery strange to the reader how any one who professed himself a Christian\nin good earnest should be open to the imputation of resting his hopes and\nhis heart in the tents of paganism; but we do not see why Agellius has not\nquite as much right to be inconsistent in one way as Christians of the\npresent time in another, and perhaps he has more to say for himself than\nthey. They have not had the trial of solitude, nor the consequent\ntemptation to which he has been exposed, of seeking relief from his own\nthoughts in the company of unbelievers. When a boy he had received his\neducation at that school in the Temple of Mercury of which we heard in the\nforegoing chapter; and though happily he had preserved himself from the\ncontagion of idolatry and sin, he had on that very account formed no\nfriendships with his schoolfellows. Whether there were any Christians\nthere besides himself he did not know; but while the worst of his\nschoolfellows were what heathen boys may be supposed to be, the lightest\ncensure which could be passed on any was that they were greedy, or\nquarrelsome, or otherwise unamiable. He had learned there enough to open\nhis mind, and to give him materials for thinking, and instruments for\nreflecting on his own religion, and for drawing out into shape his own\nreflections. He had received just that discipline which makes solitude\nmost pleasant to the old, and most insupportable to the young. He had got\na thousand questions which needed answers, a thousand feelings which\nneeded sympathy. He wanted to know whether his guesses, his perplexities,\nhis trials of mind, were peculiar to himself, or how far they were shared\nby others, and what they were worth. He had capabilities for intellectual\nenjoyment unexercised, and a thirst after knowledge unsatisfied. And the\nchannels of supernatural assistance were removed from him at a time when\nnature was most impetuous and most clamorous.\n\nIt was under circumstances such as these that two young Greeks, brother\nand sister, the brother older, the sister younger, than Agellius, came to\nSicca at the invitation of Jucundus, who wanted them for his trade. His\nnephew in time got acquainted with them, and found in them what he had\nsought in vain elsewhere. It is not that they were oracles of wisdom or\nrepositories of philosophical learning; their age and their calling\nforbade it, nor did he require it. For an oracle, of course, he would have\nlooked in another direction; but he desiderated something more on a level\nwith himself, and that they abundantly supplied. He found, from his\nconversations with them, that a great number of the questions which had\nbeen a difficulty to him had already been agitated in the schools of\nGreece. He found what solutions were possible, what the hinge was on which\nquestions turned, what the issue to which they led, and what the principle\nwhich lay at the bottom of them. He began better to understand the\nposition of Christianity in the world of thought, and the view which was\ntaken of it by the advocates of other religions or philosophies. He gained\nsome insight into its logic, and advanced, without knowing it, in the\ninvestigation of its evidences.\n\nNor was this all; he acquired by means of his new friends a great deal\nalso of secular knowledge as well as philosophical. He learned much of the\nhistory of foreign countries, especially of Greece, of its heroes and\nsages, its poets and its statesmen, of Alexander, of the Syro-Macedonic\nempire, of the Jews, and of the series of conquests through which Rome\nadvanced to universal dominion.\n\nTo impart knowledge is as interesting as to acquire it; and Agellius was\ncalled upon to give as well as to take. The brother and sister, without\nshowing any great religious earnestness, were curious to know about\nChristianity, and listened with the more patience that they had no special\nattachment to any other worship. In the debates which ensued, though there\nwas no agreement, there was the pleasure of mental exercise and\nexcitement; he found enough to tell them without touching upon the more\nsacred mysteries; and while he never felt his personal faith at all\nendangered by their free conversation, his charity, or at least his\ngood-will and his gratitude, led him to hope, or even to think, that they\nwere in the way of conversion themselves. In this thought he was aided by\nhis own innocence and simplicity; and though, on looking back afterwards\nto this eventful season, he recognized many trivial occurrences which\nought to have put him on his guard, yet he had no suspicion at the time\nthat those who conversed so winningly, and sustained so gracefully and\nhappily the commerce of thought and sentiment, might in their actual\nstate, nay, in their governing principles, be in utter contrariety to\nhimself when the veil was removed from off their hearts.\n\nNor was it in serious matters alone, but still more on lighter occasions\nof intercourse, that Aristo and Callista were attractive to the solitary\nAgellius. She had a sweet thrilling voice, and accompanied herself on the\nlyre. She could act the _improvisatrice_, and her expressive features were\na running commentary on the varied meaning, the sunshine and the shade, of\nher ode or her epic. She could relate how the profane Pentheus and the\nself-glorious Hippolytus gave a lesson to the world of the feebleness of\nhuman virtue when it placed itself in opposition to divine power. She\ncould teach how the chaste Diana manifests herself to the simple shepherd\nEndymion, not to the great or learned; and how Tithonus, the spouse of the\nMorn, adumbrates the fate of those who revel in their youth, as if it were\nto last for ever; and who, when old, do nothing but talk of the days when\nthey were young, wearying others with tales of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir amours or their\nexploits, like grasshoppers that show their vigour only by their\nchirping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(3) The very allegories which sickened and irritated Arnobius\nwhen spouted out by Polemo, touched the very chords of poor Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nheart when breathed forth from the lips of the beautiful Greek.\n\nShe could act also; and suddenly, when conversation flagged or suggested\nit, she could throw herself into the part of Medea or Antigone, with a\nforce and truth which far surpassed the effect produced by the male and\nmasked representations of those characters at the theatre. Brother and\nsister were \u00c5\u0092dipus and Antigone, Electra and Orestes, Cassandra and the\nChorus. Once or twice they attempted a scene in Menander; but there was\nsomething which made Agellius shrink from the comedy, beautiful as it was,\nand clever as was the representation. Callista could act Thais as truly as\nIphigenia, but Agellius could not listen as composedly. There are certain\nmost delicate instincts and perceptions in us which act as first\nprinciples, and which, once effaced, can never, except from some\nsupernatural source, be restored to the mind. When men are in a state of\nnature, these are sinned against, and vanish very soon, at so early a date\nin the history of the individual that perhaps he does not recollect that\nhe ever possessed them; and since, like other first principles, they are\nbut very partially capable of proof, a general scepticism prevails both as\nto their existence and their truth. The Greeks, partly from the vivacity\nof their intellect, partly from their passion for the beautiful, lost\nthese celestial adumbrations sooner than other nations. When a collision\narose on such matters between Agellius and his friends, Callista kept\nsilence; but Aristo was not slow to express his wonder that the young\nChristian should think customs or practices wrong which, in his view of\nthe matter, were as unblamable and natural as eating, drinking, or\nsleeping. His own face became almost satirical as Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s became grave;\nhowever, he was too companionable and good-natured to force another to be\nhappy in his own way; he imputed to the extravagance of his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreligion what in any but a Christian he would have called moroseness and\nmisanthropy; and he bade his sister give over representations which,\ninstead of enlivening the passing hour, did but inflict pain.\n\nThis friendly intercourse had now gone on for some months, as the leisure\nof both parties admitted. Once or twice brother and sister had come to the\nsuburban farm; but for the most part, in spite of his intense dislike of\nthe city, he had for their sake threaded its crowded and narrow\nthoroughfares, crossed its open places, and presented himself at their\napartments. And was it very strange that a youth so utterly ignorant of\nthe world, and unsuspicious of evil, should not have heard the warning\nvoice which called him to separate himself from heathenism, even in its\nmost specious form? Was it very strange, under these circumstances, that a\nsanguine hope, the hope of the youthful, should have led Agellius to\noverlook obstacles, and beguile himself into the notion that Callista\nmight be converted, and make a good Christian wife? Well, we have nothing\nmore to say for him; if we have not already succeeded in extenuating his\noffence, we must leave him to the mercy, or rather to the justice, of his\nseverely virtuous censors.\n\nBut all this while Jucundus had been conversing with him; and, unless we\nare quick about it, we shall lose several particulars which are necessary\nfor those who wish to pursue without a break the thread of his history.\nHis uncle had brought the conversation round to the delicate point which\nhad occasioned his visit, and had just broken the ice. With greater tact,\nand more ample poetical resources than we should have given him credit\nfor, he had been led from the scene before him to those prospects of a\nmoral and social character which ought soon to employ the thoughts of his\ndear Agellius. He had spoken of vines and of their culture, _apropos_ of\nthe dwarf vines around him, which stood about the height of a\ncurrant-bush. Thence he had proceeded to the subject of the more common\nvine of Africa, which crept and crawled along the ground, the extremity of\neach plant resting in succession on the stock of that which immediately\npreceded it. And now, being well into his subject, he called to mind the\nhigh vine of Italy, which mounts by the support of the slim tree to which\nit clings. Then he quoted Horace on the subject of the marriage of the elm\nand the vine. This lodged him _in medias res_; and Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart beat\nwhen he found his uncle proposing to him, as a thought of his own, the\nvery step which he had fancied was almost a secret of his own breast,\nthough Juba had seemed to have some suspicion of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Agellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would be a most suitable\nproceeding. I have never taken to marrying myself; it has not lain in my\nway, or been to my taste. Your father did not set me an encouraging\nexample; but here you are living by yourself, in this odd fashion, unlike\nany one else. Perhaps you may come in time and live in Sicca. We shall\nfind some way of employing you, and it will be pleasant to have you near\nme as I get old. However, I mean it to be some time yet before Charon\nmakes a prize of me; not that I believe all that rubbish more than you,\nAgellius, I assure you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt strikes me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Agellius began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat perhaps you may think it\ninconsistent in me taking such a step, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the rub,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Jucundus; then aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cInconsistent, my\nboy! who talks of inconsistency? what superfine jackanapes dares to call\nit inconsistent? You seem made for each other, Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0094she town, you\ncountry; she so clever and attractive, and up to the world, you so fresh\nand Arcadian. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be quite the talk of the place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just what I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncontinued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if I thought it inconsistent with my religion to think of\nCallista\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted his uncle, who took his cue from Juba,\nand was afraid of the workings of Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s human respect; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut who knows\nyou have been a Christian? no one knows anything about it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be bound\nthey all think you an honest fellow like themselves, a worshipper of the\ngods, without crotchets or hobbies of any kind. I never told them to the\ncontrary. My opinion is, that if you were to make your libation to Jove,\nand throw incense upon the imperial altar to-morrow, no one would think it\nextraordinary. They would say for certain that they had seen you do it\nagain and again. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fancy for an instant, my dear Agellius, that you\nhave anything whatever to get over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius was getting awkward and mortified, as may be easily conceived,\nand Jucundus saw it, but could not make out why. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nyouth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are reproaching me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a bit of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, confidently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a shadow of reproach;\nwhy should I reproach you? We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be wise all at once; _I_ had my\nfollies once, as you may have had yours. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural you should grow more\nattached to things as they are,\u00e2\u0080\u0094things as they are, you know,\u00e2\u0080\u0094as time goes\non. Marriage, and the preparation for marriage, sobers a man. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been\na little headstrong, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny, and had your fling in your own way; but\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098nuces pueris,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as you will soon be saying yourself on a certain occasion.\nYour next business is to consider what kind of a marriage you propose. I\nsuppose the Roman, but there is great room for choice even there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is a proverb how different things are in theory and when reduced to\npractice. Agellius had thought of the end more than of the means, and had\nhad a vision of Callista as a Christian, when the question of rites and\nforms would have been answered by the decision of the Church without his\ntrouble. He _was_ somewhat sobered by the question, though in a different\nway from what his uncle wished and intended.\n\nJucundus proceeded\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, there is _matrimonium confarreationis_. You\nhave nothing to do with that: strictly speaking, it is obsolete; it went\nout with the exclusiveness of the old patricians. I say \u00e2\u0080\u0098strictly\nspeaking\u00e2\u0080\u0099; for the ceremonies remain, waiving the formal religious rite.\nWell, my dear Agellius, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend this ceremonial to you. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nhave to kill a porker, to take out the entrails, to put away the gall, and\nto present it to Juno Pronuba. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire, too, and water, and\nfrankincense, and a great deal of the same kind, which I think\nundesirable, and you would too; for there, I am sure, we are agreed. We\nput this aside then, the religious marriage. Next comes the marriage _ex\ncoemptione_, a sort of mercantile transaction. In this case the parties\nbuy each other, and become each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s property. Well, every man to his\ntaste; but for me, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to be bought and sold. I like to be my own\nmaster, and am suspicious of anything irrevocable. Why should you commit\nyourself (do you see?) for ever, _for ever_, to a girl you know so little\nof? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look surprised: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common sense. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very well to buy _her_;\nbut to be bought, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite another matter. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that you\ncan. Being a Roman citizen yourself, you can only make a marriage with a\ncitizen; now the question is whether Callista is a citizen at all. I know\nperfectly well the sweeping measure some years back of Caracalla, which\nmade all freemen citizens of Rome, whatever might be their country; but\nthat measure has never been carried out in fact. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have very great\ndifficulty with the law and the customs of the country; and then, after\nall, if the world were willing to gratify you, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your proof she is a\nfreewoman? My dear boy, I must speak out for your good, though you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\noffended with me. I wish you to have her, I do; but you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do\nimpossibilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t alter facts. The laws of the empire allow you to\nhave her in a certain definite way, and no other; and you cannot help the\nlaw being what it is. I say all this, even on the supposition of her being\na freewoman; but it is just possible she may be in law a slave. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nstart in that way; the pretty thing is neither better nor worse for what\nshe cannot help. I say it for your good. Well, now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming to my point.\nThere is a third kind of marriage, and that is what I should recommend for\nyou. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the _matrimonium ex usu_, or _consuetudine_; the great advantage\nhere is, that you have no ceremonies whatever, nothing which can in any\nway startle your sensitive mind. In that case, a couple are at length man\nand wife _pr\u00c3\u00a6scriptione_. You are afraid of making a stir in Sicca; in\nthis case you would make none. You would simply take her home here; if, as\ntime went on, you got on well together, it would be a marriage; if\nnot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he shrugged his shoulders\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cno harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done; you are both free.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius had been sitting on a gate of one of the vineyards; he started on\nhis feet, threw up his arms, and made an exclamation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, listen, my dear boy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus, hastening to explain what\nhe considered the cause of his sudden annoyance; \u00e2\u0080\u009clisten, just one moment,\nAgellius, if you can. Dear, dear, how I wish I knew where to find you!\nWhat _is_ the matter? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not treating her ill, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not indeed. I have not\nhad any notion at all even of hinting that you should leave her, unless\nyou both wished the bargain rescinded. No, but it is a great rise for her;\nyou are a Roman, with property, with position in the place; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nstranger, and without a dower: nobody knows whence she came, or anything\nabout her. She ought to have no difficulty about it, and I am confident\nwill have none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO my good, dear uncle! O Jucundus, Jucundus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it\npossible? do my ears hear right? What is it you ask me to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he\nburst into tears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it conceivable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with energy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you are\nin earnest in recommending me\u00e2\u0080\u0094I say in recommending me\u00e2\u0080\u0094a marriage which\nreally would be no marriage at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is some very great mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, angrily; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit arises,\nAgellius, from your ignorance of the world. You must be thinking I\nrecommend you mere _contubernium_, as the lawyers call it. Well, I confess\nI did think of that for a moment, it occurred to me; I should have liked\nto have mentioned it, but knowing how preposterously touchy and skittish\nyou are on supposed points of honour, or sentiment, or romance, or of\nsomething or other indescribable, I said not one word about that. I have\nonly wished to consult for your comfort, present and future. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do\nme justice, Agellius. I have been attempting to smooth your way. You\n_must_ act according to the received usages of society! you cannot make a\nworld for yourself. Here have I proposed three or four ways for your\nproceeding: you will have none of them. What _will_ you have? I thought\nyou didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like ceremonies; I thought you did not like the established\nways. Go, then, do it in the old fashion; kill your sheep, knead your\nmeal, light your torches, sing your song, summon your flamen, if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ncome. Any how, take your choice; do it either with religion or without.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Jucundus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the poor fellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cam I then come to this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he could\nsay no more.\n\nHis distress was not greater than his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappointment, perplexity,\nand annoyance. The latter had been making everything easy for Agellius,\nand he was striking, do what he would, on hidden, inexplicable\nimpediments, whichever way he moved. He got more and more angry the more\nhe thought about it. An unreasonable, irrational coxcomb! He had heard a\ngreat deal of the portentous stubbornness of a Christian, and now he\nunderstood what it was. It was in his blood, he saw; an offensive, sour\nhumour, tainting him from head to foot. A very different recompense had he\ndeserved. There had he come all the way from his home from purely\ndisinterested feelings. He had no motive whatever, but a simple desire of\nhis nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welfare; what other motive could he have? \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet Agellius go to\nthe crows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he will; what is it to me if he is seized for\na Christian, hung up like a dog, or thrown like a dead rat into the\n_cloaca_ of the prison? What care I if he is made a hy\u00c3\u00a6na\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breakfast in\nthe amphitheatre, all Sicca looking on, or if he is nailed on a cross for\nthe birds to peck at before my door? Ungrateful puppy! it is no earthly\nconcern of mine what becomes of him. I shall be neither better nor worse.\nNo one will say a word against Jucundus; he will not lose a single\ncustomer, or be shunned by a single jolly companion, for the exposure of\nhis nephew. But a man can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be saved against his will. Here am I, full of\nexpedients and resources for his good; there is he, throwing cold water on\neverything, and making difficulties as if he loved them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his\nabominable pride, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pith of the matter. He could not have behaved\nworse though I had played the bully with him, and had reproached him with\nhis Christianity. But I have studiously avoided every subject which could\nput his back up. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very Typhon or Enceladus for pride. Here he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d give\nhis ears to have done with Christianity; he wants to have this Callista;\nhe wants to buy her at the price of his religion; but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be\nburned than say, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve changed! Let him reap as he has sown; why should I\ncoax him further to be merciful to himself? Well Agellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said aloud,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius, on the other hand, had his own thoughts; and the most urgent of\nthem at the moment was sorrow that he had hurt his uncle. He was sincerely\nattached to him, in consequence of his faithful guardianship, his many\nacts of kindness, the reminiscences of childhood, nay, the love he bore to\nthe good points of his character. To him he owed his education and his\nrespectable position. He could not bear his anger, and he had a fear of\nhis authority; but what was to be done? Jucundus, in utter insensibility\nto certain instincts and rules which in Christianity are first principles,\nhad, without intending it, been greatly dishonouring Agellius, and his\npassion, and the object of it. Uncle and nephew had been treading on each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toes, and each was wincing under the mischance. It was Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nplace, as the younger, to make advances, if he could, to an adjustment of\nthe misunderstanding; and he wished to find some middle way. And, also, it\nis evident he had another inducement besides his tenderness to Jucundus to\nurge him to do so. In truth, Callista exerted a tremendous sway over him.\nThe conversation which had just passed ought to have opened his eyes, and\nmade him understand that the very first step in any negotiations between\nthem was her _bon\u00c3\u00a2 fide_ conversion. It was evident he could not, he\nliterally had not the power of marrying her as a heathen. Roman might\nmarry a Roman; but a degradation of each party in the transaction was the\nonly way by which a Roman could make any sort of marriage with a Greek. If\nshe were converted, they would be both of them under the rules of the\nCatholic Church. But what prospect was there of so happy an event? What\nhad ever fallen from her lips which looked that way? Could not a clever\ngirl throw herself into the part of Alcestis, or chant the majestic verses\nof Cleanthes, or extemporize a hymn upon the spring, or hold an argument\non the _pulchrum_ and _utile_, without having any leaning towards\nChristianity? A calm, sweet voice, a noble air, an expressive countenance,\nrefined and decorous manners, were these specific indications of heavenly\ngrace? Ah, poor Agellius! a fascination is upon you; and so you are\nthinking of some middle term, which is to reconcile your uncle and you;\nand therefore you begin as follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see by your silence, Jucundus, that you are displeased with me, you who\nare always so kind. Well, it comes from my ignorance of things; it does\nindeed. I ask your forgiveness for anything which seemed ungrateful in my\nbehaviour, though there is not ingratitude in my heart. I am too much of a\nboy to see things beforehand, and to see them in all their bearings. You\ntook me by surprise by talking on the subject which led to our\nmisunderstanding. I will not conceal for an instant that I like Callista\nvery much; and that the more I see her, I like her the more. It strikes me\nthat, if you break the matter to Aristo, he and I might have some talk\ntogether, and understand each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJucundus was hot-tempered, but easily pacified; and he really did wish to\nbe on confidential terms with his nephew at the present crisis; so he\ncaught at his apology. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you speak like a reasonable fellow, Agellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, I will speak to Aristo, as you wish; and on this\nquestion of _consuetudo_ or prescription. Well, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t begin looking queer\nagain. I mean I will speak to him on the whole question and its details.\nHe and I will talk together for our respective principals. We shall soon\ncome to terms, I warrant you; and then _you_ shall talk with him. Come,\nshow me round your fields,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let me see how you will be\nable to present things to your bride. A very pretty property it is. I it\nwas who was the means of your father thinking of it. You have heard me say\nso before now, and all the circumstances.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was at Carthage at this time, undecided what to do with himself. It so\nhappened that Julia Clara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estates were just then in the market. An\nenormous windfall her estates were. Old Didius was emperor just before my\ntime; he gave all his estates to his daughter as soon as he assumed the\npurple. Poor lady! she did not enjoy them long; Severus confiscated the\nwhole, not, however, for the benefit of the state, but of the _res\nprivata_. They are so large in Africa alone, that, as you know, you are\nunder a special procurator. Well, they did not come into the market at\nonce; the existing farmers were retained. Marcus Juventius farmed a very\nconsiderable portion of them; they were contiguous, and dovetailed into\nhis own lands, and accordingly, when he got into trouble, and had to sell\nhis leases, there were certain odds and ends about Sicca which it was\nproposed to lease piecemeal. Your employer, Varius, would have given any\nmoney for them, but I was beforehand with him. Nothing like being on the\nspot; he was on business of the proconsul at Adrumetum. I sent off Hispa\ninstantly to Strabo; not an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delay after I heard of it. The sale was\nat Carthage; he went to his old commander, who used his influence, and the\nthing was done.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI venture to say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not such a snug little farm in all Africa; and I\nam sanguine we shall get a renewal, though Varius will do his utmost to\noutbid us. Ah, my dear Agellius, if there is but a suspicion you are not a\nthorough-going Roman! Well, well,\u00e2\u0080\u0094here! ease me through this gate,\nAgellius; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come to the gate since I was here.\nIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes! you have improved this very much. That small arbour is\ndelicious; but you want an image, an Apollo or a Diana. Ah! do now stop\nfor a moment; why are you going forward at such a pace? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you an\nimage: it shall be one that you will really like. Well, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have it?\nI beg you ten thousand pardons. Ha, ha! I mean nothing. Ha, ha, ha! Oh,\nwhat an odd world it is! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Well, I am keeping you from\nyour labourers. Ha, ha, ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd having thus smoothed his own ruffled temper, and set things right, as\nhe considered, with Agellius, the old pagan took his journey homewards,\nassuring Agellius that he would make all things clear for him in a very\nshort time, and telling him to be sure to make a call upon Aristo before\nthe ensuing calends.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                CHAPTER X.\n\n\n                           THE DIVINE CALLISTA.\n\n\nThe day came which Agellius had fixed for paying his promised visit to\nAristo. It is not to be denied that, in the interval, the difficulties of\nthe business which occasioned his visit had increased upon his\napprehensions. Callista was not yet a Christian, nor was there any reason\nfor saying that a proposal of marriage would make her one; and a strange\nsort of convert she would be, if it did. He would not suffer himself to\ndwell upon difficulties which he was determined never should be realized.\nNo; of course a heathen he could not marry, but a heathen Callista should\nnot be. He did not see the process, but he was convinced she would become\na Christian. Yet somehow so it was, that, if he was able to stultify his\nreason, he did not quite succeed to his satisfaction with his conscience.\nEvery morning found him less satisfied with himself, and more disposed to\nrepent of having allowed his uncle to enter on the subject with Aristo.\nBut it was a thing done and over; he must either awkwardly back out, or he\nmust go on. His middle term, as he hastily had considered it, was nothing\nelse than siding with his uncle, and committing himself to go all lengths,\nunless some difficulty rose with the other party. Yet could he really wish\nthat the step had not been taken? Was it not plain that if he was to put\naway Callista from his affections, he must never go near her? And was he\nto fall back on his drear solitude, and lose that outlet of thought and\nrelief of mind which he had lately found in the society of his Greek\nfriends?\n\nWe may easily believe that he was not very peaceful in heart when he set\nout on that morning to call upon Aristo; yet he would not allow that he\nwas doing wrong. He recurred to the pleasant imagination that Callista\nwould certainly become a Christian, and dwelt pertinaciously upon it. He\ncould not tell on what it was founded; he knew enough of his religion not\nto mean that she was too good to be a heathen; so it is to be supposed he\nmeant that he discerned what he hoped were traces of some supernatural\ninfluence operating upon her mind. He had a perception, which he could not\njustify by argument, that there was in Callista a promise of something\nhigher than anything she yet was. He felt a strange sympathy with her,\nwhich certainly unless he utterly deceived himself, was not based on\nanything merely natural or human,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sympathy the more remarkable from the\ncontrariety which existed between them in matters of religious belief. And\nhope having blown this large and splendid bubble, sent it sailing away,\nand it rose upon the buoyant atmosphere of youth, beautiful to behold.\n\nAnd yet, as Agellius ascended the long flight of marble steps which led\nthe foot-passenger up into that fair city, while the morning sun was\nglancing across them, and surveyed the outline of the many sumptuous\nbuildings which crested and encircled the hill, did he not know full well\nthat iniquity was written on its very walls, and spoke a solemn warning to\na Christian heart to go out of it, to flee it, not to take up a home in\nit, not to make alliance with anything in it? Did he not know from\nexperience full well that, when he got into it, his glance could no longer\nbe unrestrained, or his air free; but that it would be necessary for him\nto keep a control upon his senses, and painfully guard himself against\nwhat must either be a terror to him and an abhorrence, or a temptation?\nEnter in imagination into a town like Sicca, and you will understand the\ngreat Apostle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anguish at seeing a noble and beautiful city given up to\nidolatry. Enter it, and you will understand why it was that the poor\npriest, of whom Jucundus spoke so bitterly, hung his head, and walked with\ntimid eyes and clouded brow through the joyous streets of Carthage.\nHitherto we have only been conducting heathens through it, boys or men,\nJucundus, Arnobius, and Firmian; but now a Christian enters it with a\nChristian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart and a Christian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope.\n\nWell is it for us, dear reader, that we in this age do not experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094nay,\na blessed thing that we cannot even frame to ourselves in imagination\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nactual details of evil which hung as an atmosphere over the cities of\nPagan Rome. An Apostle calls the tongue \u00e2\u0080\u009ca fire, a world of iniquity,\nuntameable, a restless evil, a deadly poison;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and surely what he says\napplies to hideous thoughts represented to the eye, as well as when they\nare made to strike upon the ear. Unfortunate Agellius! what takes you into\nthe city this morning? Doubtless some urgent, compulsive duty; otherwise\nyou would not surely be threading its lanes or taking the circuit of its\nporticoes, amid sights which now shock and now allure; fearful sights\u00e2\u0080\u0094not\nhere and there, but on the stateliest structures and in the meanest\nhovels, in public offices and private houses, in central spots and at the\ncorners of the streets, in bazaars and shops and house-doors, in the\nrudest workmanship and in the highest art, in letters or in emblems or in\npaintings\u00e2\u0080\u0094the insignia and the pomp of Satan and of Belial, of a reign of\ncorruption and a revel of idolatry which you can neither endure nor\nescape. Wherever you go it is all the same; in the police-court on the\nright, in the military station on the left, in the crowd around the\ntemple, in the procession with its victims and its worshippers who walk to\nmusic, in the language of the noisy market-people; wherever you go, you\nare accosted, confronted, publicly, shamelessly, now as if a precept of\nreligion, now as if a homage to nature, by all which, as a Christian, you\nshrink from and abjure.\n\nIt is no accident of the season or of the day; it is the continuous\ntradition of some thousands of years; it is the very orthodoxy of the\nmyriads who have lived and died there. There was a region once, in an\nearly age, lying upon the Eastern Sea, which is said at length to have\nvomited out its inhabitants for their frightful iniquity. They, thus cast\nforth, took ship, and passed over to the southern coast; and then,\ngradually settling and spreading into the interior, they peopled the woody\nplains and fertile slopes of Africa, and filled it with their cities.\nSicca is one of these set up in sin; and at the time of which we write\nthat sin was basking under the sun, and rioting and extending itself to\nits amplest dimensions, like some glittering serpent or spotted pard of\nthe neighbourhood, without interposition from heaven or earth in\ncorrection of so awful a degradation. In such scenes of unspeakable\npollution, our Christian forefathers perforce lived; through such a scene,\nthough not taking part in it, Agellius, blessed with a country home, is\nunnecessarily passing.\n\nHe has reached the house, or rather the floor, to which he has been making\nhis way. It is at the back of the city, where the rock is steep; and it\nlooks out upon the plain and the mountain range to the north. Its inmates,\nAristo and Callista, are engaged in their ordinary work of moulding or\ncarving, painting or gilding the various articles which the temples or the\nprivate shrines of the established religion required. Aristo has received\nfrom Jucundus the overtures which Agellius had commissioned him to make,\nand finds, as he anticipated, that they are no great news to his sister.\nShe perfectly understands what is going on, but does not care to speak\nmuch upon it, till Agellius makes his appearance. As they sit at work,\nAristo speaks:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius will make his appearance here this morning. I say, Callista,\nwhat can he be coming for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, if your news be true, that the Christians are coming into trouble,\nof course he means to purchase, as a blessing on him, some of these bits\nof gods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are sharp enough, my little sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto know\nperfectly well who is the goddess he is desirous of purchasing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista laughed carelessly, but made no reply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Aristo continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be cruel to him. Wreath a garland\nfor him by the time he comes. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well to do, and modest withal, and\nneeds encouragement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Callista.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fellow too well off to be despised as a lover,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proceeded\nher brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it would be a merit with the gods to rid him of his\nsuperstition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot much of a Christian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she made answer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he is set upon me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor whose sake has he been coming here so often, mine or yours,\nCallista?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am tired of such engagements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied. She went on with her\npainting, and several times seemed as if she would have spoken, but did\nnot. Then, without interrupting her work, she said calmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTime was, it\ngratified my conceit and my feelings to have hangers on. Indeed, without\nthem, how should we have had means to come here? But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a weariness\nin all things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA weariness! Where is this bad humour to end?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit has been\na long fit; shake it off while you can, or it will be too much for you.\nWhat can you mean? a weariness! You are over young to bid youth farewell.\nAching hearts for aching bones. So young and so perverse! We must take\nthings as the gods give them. You will ask for them in vain when you are\nold. One day above, another day beneath; one while young, another while\nold. Enjoy life while you have it in your hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had said this as he\nworked. Then he stopped, and turned round to her, with his graving-tool in\nhis hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecollect old Lesbia, how she used to squeak out to me, with\nher nodding head and trembling limbs\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094here he mimicked the old crone\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098My\nboy, take your pleasure while you can. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take pleasure\u00e2\u0080\u0094my day is\nover; but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reproach myself. I had a merry time of it while it\nlasted. Time stops for no one, but I did my best; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reproach\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the true philosopher, though a slave; more outspoken than\n\u00c3\u0086sop, more practical than Epictetus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista began singing to herself:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n        \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wander by that river\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brink\n          Which circles Pluto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drear domain;\n        I feel the chill night breeze, and think\n          Of joys which ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er shall be again.\n\n        \u00e2\u0080\u009cI count the weeds that fringe the shore,\n          Each sluggish wave that rolls and rolls;\n        I hear the ever-splashing oar\n          Of Charon, ferryman of souls.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeigho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle regret, but much dread. The young have to\nfear more than the old have to mourn over. The future outweighs the past.\nLife is not so sweet as death is bitter. It is hard to quit the light, the\nlight of heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCallistidion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, impatiently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy girl, this is preposterous. How\nlong is this to go on? We must take you to Carthage; there is more trade\nthere, if we can get it; and it will be on the bright, far-resounding sea.\nAnd I will turn rhetorician, and you shall feed my classes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO beautiful, divine light,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a loss! O, to think that\none day I must lose you for ever! At home I used to lie awake at night\nlonging for the morning, and crying out for the god of day. It was like\nchoice wine to me, a cup of Chian, the first streaks of the Aurora, and I\ncould hardly bear his bright coming, when he came to me like Semele, for\nrapture. How gloriously did he shoot over the hills! and then anon he\nrested awhile on the snowy summit of Olympus, as in some luminous shrine,\ngladdening the Phrygian plain. Fair, bright-haired god! thou art my\nworship, if Callista worships aught: but somehow I worship nothing now. I\nam weary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her brother in a soothing tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a change. That light,\nelastic air, that transparent heaven, that fresh temperate breeze, that\nmajestic sea! Africa is not Greece; O, the difference! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it,\nCallista; it is the _nostalgia_; you are home-sick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not well know what I would have. Yes, the\npoisonous dews, the heavy heat, the hideous beasts, the green\nfever-gendering swamps. This vast thickly-wooded plain, like some\nmysterious labyrinth, oppresses and disquiets me with its very richness.\nThe luxuriant foliage, the tall, rank plants, the deep, close lanes, I do\nnot see my way through them, and I pant for breath. I only breathe freely\non this hill. O, how unlike Greece, with the clear, soft, delicate\ncolouring of its mountains, and the pure azure or the purple of its\nwaters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my dear Callista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted her brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009crecollect you are not\nin those oppressive, gloomy forests, but in Sicca, and no one asks you to\npenetrate them. And if you want mountains, I think those on the horizon\nare bare enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the race of man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis worse than all. Where is the\ngenius of our bright land? where its intelligence, playfulness, grace, and\nnoble bearing? Here hearts are as black as brows, and smiles as\ntreacherous as the adders of the wood. The natives are crafty and\nremorseless; they never relax; they have no cheerfulness or mirth; their\nvery love is a furnace, and their sole ecstasy is revenge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo country like home to any of us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet here you are. Habit\nwould be a second nature if you were here long enough; your feelings would\nbecome acclimated, and would find a new home. People get to like the\ndarkness of the extreme north in course of time. The painted Britons, the\nCimmerians, the Hyperboreans, are content never to see the sun at all,\nwhich is your god. Here your own god reigns; why quarrel with him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sun of Greece is light,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Callista; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sun of Africa is\nfire. I am no fire-worshipper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect even Styx and Phlegethon are tolerable, at length,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her\nbrother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif Phlegethon and Styx there be, as the poets tell us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cold, foggy Styx is the north,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Callista, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the south is the\nscorching, blasting Phlegethon, and Greece, clear, sweet, and sunny, is\nthe Elysian fields.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she continued her improvisations:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n        \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere are the islands of the blest?\n          They stud the \u00c3\u0086gean sea;\n        And where the deep Elysian rest?\n        It haunts the vale where Peneus strong\n        Pours his incessant stream along,\n        While craggy ridge and mountain bare\n        Cut keenly through the liquid air,\n        And, in their own pure tints arrayed,\n        Scorn earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s green robes which change and fade,\n        And stand in beauty undecayed,\n          Guards of the bold and free.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lower flight, if you please, just now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, interrupting her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do really wish a serious word with you about Agellius. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fellow I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help liking, in spite of his misanthropy. Let me plead his cause.\nLike him or not yourself, still he has a full purse; and you will do a\nservice to yourself and to the gods of Greece, and to him too, if you will\nsmile on him. Smile on him at least for a time; we will go to Carthage\nwhen you are tired. His looks have very little in them of a Christian\nleft; you may blow it away with your breath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne might do worse than be a Christian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif all is\ntrue that I have heard of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAristo started up in irritation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy all the gods of Olympus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is intolerable! If a man wants a tormentor, I commend him to a girl\nlike you. What has ailed thee some time past, you silly child? What have I\ndone to you that you should have got so cross and contrary and so hard to\nplease?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I were a Christian, life would be more bearable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBearable!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he echoed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbearable! ye gods! more bearable to have Styx and\nTartarus, the Furies and their snakes, in this world as well as in the\nnext? to have evil within and without, to hate one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self and to be hated\nof all men! to live the life of an ass, and to die the death of a dog!\nBearable! But hark! I hear Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s step on the staircase. Callista,\ndear Callista, be yourself. Listen to reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Callista would not listen to reason, if her brother was its\nembodiment; but went on with her singing:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n        \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor what is Afric but the home\n          Of burning Phlegethon?\n        What the low beach and silent gloom,\n        And chilling mists of that dull river,\n        Along whose bank the thin ghosts shiver,\n        The thin, wan ghosts that once were men,\n        But Tauris, isle of moor and fen;\n        Or, dimly traced by seaman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ken,\n          The pale-cliffed Albion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere she stopped, looked down, and busied herself with her work.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XI.\n\n\n                CALLISTA\u00e2\u0080\u0099S PREACHING, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.\n\n\nIt is undeniably a solemn moment, under any circumstances, and requires a\nstrong heart, when any one deliberately surrenders himself, soul and body,\nto the keeping of another while life shall last; and this, or something\nlike this, reserving the supreme claim of duty to the Creator, is the\nmatrimonial contract. In individual cases it may be made without thought\nor distress, but surveyed objectively, and as carried out into a\nsufficient range of instances, it is so tremendous an undertaking that\nnature seems to sink under its responsibilities. When the Christian binds\nhimself by vows to a religious life, he makes a surrender to Him who is\nall-perfect, and whom he may unreservedly trust. Moreover, looking at that\nsurrender on its human side, he has the safeguard of distinct _provisos_\nand regulations, and of the principles of theology, to secure him against\ntyranny on the part of his superiors. But what shall be his encouragement\nto make himself over, without condition or stipulation, as an absolute\nproperty, to a fallible being, and that not for a season, but for life?\nThe mind shrinks from such a sacrifice, and demands that, as religion\nenjoins it, religion should sanction and bless it. It instinctively\ndesires that either the bond should be dissoluble, or that the subjects of\nit should be sacramentally strengthened to maintain it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo help me God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthe formula of every oath, is emphatically necessary here.\n\nBut Agellius is contemplating a superhuman engagement without superhuman\nassistance; and that in a state of society in which public opinion, which\nin some sense compensates for the absence of religion, supplied human\nmotives, not for, but against keeping it, and with one who had given no\nindication that she understood what marriage meant. No wonder then, that,\nin spite of his simplicity, his sanguine temperament, and his delusion,\nthe more he thought of the step he had taken, the more unsatisfactory he\nfound it, and the nearer he grew to the time when he must open the subject\nwith Aristo, the less he felt able to do so. In consequence he was in a\ndistress of mind, as he ascended the staircase which led to his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlodging, to which his anxiety, as he mounted the hill on the other side of\nthe city, was tranquillity itself; and, except that he was coming by\nengagement, he would have turned back, and for the time at least have put\nthe whole subject from his thoughts. Yet even then, as often as Callista\nrose in his mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye, his scruples and misgivings vanished before the\nbeauty of that image, as mists before the sun; and when he actually stood\nin her sweet presence, it seemed as if some secret emanation from her\nflowed in upon his heart, and he stood breathless and giddy under the\nintensity of the fascination.\n\nHowever, the reader must not suppose that in the third century of our era\nsuch negotiations as that which now seems to be on the point of coming off\nbetween Callista and Agellius, were embellished with those transcendental\nsentiments and that magnificent ceremonial with which chivalry has\ninvested them in these latter ages. There was little occasion then for\nfine speaking or exquisite deportment; and if there had been, we, who are\nthe narrators of these hitherto unrecorded transactions, should have been\nutterly unable to do justice to them. At that time of day the Christian\nhad too much simplicity, the heathen too little of real delicacy, to\nindulge in the sublimities of modern love-making, at least as it is found\nin novels; and in the case before us both gentleman and lady will be\nthought, we consider, sadly matter-of-fact, or rather semi-barbarous, by\nthe votaries of what is just now called European civilization.\n\nOn Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entering the room, Aristo was pacing to and fro in some\ndiscomposure; however, he ran up to his friend, embraced him, and, looking\nat him with significance, congratulated him on his good looks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is\nmore fire in your eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdear Agellius, and more eloquence in the\nturn of your lip, than I have ever yet seen. A new spirit is in you. So\nyou are determined to come out of your solitude? That you should have been\nable to exist in it so long is the wonderment to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius had recovered himself, yet he dared not look again on Callista.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not jest, Aristo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am come, as you know, to talk to you\nabout your sister. I have brought her a present of flowers; they are my\nbest present, or rather not mine, but the birth of the opening year, as\nfair and fragrant as herself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will offer them to our Pallas Athene,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his friend, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto whom we\nartists are especially devout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he would have led Agellius on, and\nmade him place them in her niche in the opposite wall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am more serious than you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I have brought the\nbest my garden contains as an offering to your sister. _She_ will not\nthink I bring them for any other purpose. Where are you going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncontinued, as he saw his friend take down his broad _petasus_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I am so poor an interpreter of your\nmeaning, you can dispense with me altogether. I will leave you to speak\nfor yourself, and meanwhile will go and see what old Dromo has to tell,\nbefore the sun is too high in the heavens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSaying this, with a half-imploring, half-satirical look at his sister, he\nset off to the barber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the Forum.\n\nAgellius took up the flowers, and laid them on the table before her, as\nshe sat at work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you accept my flowers, Callista?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFair and fragrant, like myself, are they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she made reply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive them to\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She took them, and bent over them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe blushing rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\ngravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe stately lily, the royal carnation, the golden moly, the\npurple amaranth, the green bryon, the diosanthos, the sertula, the sweet\nmodest saliunca, fit emblems of Callista. Well, in a few hours they will\nhave faded; yes, they will get more and more like her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe paused and looked him steadily in the face, and then continued:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius, I once had a slave who belonged to your religion. She had been\nborn in a Christian family, and came into my possession on her master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeath. She was unlike any one I have seen before or since; she cared for\nnothing, yet was not morose or peevish or hard-hearted. She died young in\nmy service. Shortly before her end she had a dream. She saw a company of\nbright shades, clothed in white, like the hours which circle round the god\nof day. They were crowned with flowers, and they said to each other,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_She_ ought to have a token too.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So they took her hand, and led her to a\nmost beautiful lady, as stately as Juno and as sweet as Ariadne, so\nradiant in countenance that they themselves suddenly looked like\nEthiopians by the side of her. She, too, was crowned with flowers, and\nthese so dazzling that they might be the stars of heaven or the gems of\nAsia for what Chione could tell. And that fair goddess (angel you call\nher) said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear, here is something for you from my Son. He sends you\nby me a red rose for your love, a white lily for your chastity, purple\nviolets to strew your grave, and green palms to flourish over it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Is this\nthe reason why you give me flowers, Agellius, that I may rank with Chione?\nand is this their interpretation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is my heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most fervent wish, it is my\nmind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vivid anticipation, that the day may come when you will receive\nsuch a crown, nay, a brighter one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you are come, of course, to philosophize to me, and to put me in the\nway of dying like Chione,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she made answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI implore your pardon. You\nare offering me flowers, it seems, not for a bridal wreath, but for a\nfuneral urn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it wonderful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the two wishes should have gone\ntogether in my heart; and that while I trusted and prayed that you might\nhave the same Master in heaven as I have myself, I also hoped you would\nhave the same service, the same aims, the same home upon earth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that you should speak one word for your Master and two for yourself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe retorted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has been by feeling how much you could be to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I\nhave been led to think how much my Master may be doing for you already,\nand how much in time to come you might do for Him. Callista, do not urge\nme with your Greek subtlety, or expect me to analyze my feelings more\nprecisely than I have the ability to do. May I calmly tell you the state\nof my mind, as I do know it, and will you patiently listen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe signified her willingness, and he continued\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis only I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat I have experienced ever since I first heard you converse, that\nthere is between you and me a unity of thought so strange that I should\nhave deemed it could not have been, before I found it actually to exist,\nbetween any two persons whatever; and which, widely as we are separated in\nopinion and habit, and differently as we have been brought up, is to me\ninexplicable. I find it difficult to explain what I mean; we disagree\ncertainly on the most important subjects, yet there is an unaccountable\ncorrespondence in the views we take of things, in our impressions, in the\nline in which our minds move, and the issues to which they come, in our\njudgment of what is great and little, and the manner in which objects\naffect our feelings. When I speak to my uncle, when I speak to your\nbrother, I do not understand them, nor they me. We are moving in different\nspheres, and I am solitary, however much they talk. But to my\nastonishment, I find between you and me one language. Is it wonderful\nthat, in proportion to my astonishment, I am led to refer it to one cause,\nand think that one Master Hand must have engraven those lines on the soul\nof each of us? Is it wonderful that I should fancy that He who has made us\nalike has made us for each other, and that the very same persuasives by\nwhich I bring you to cast your eyes on me, may draw you also to cast\nyourself in adoration at the feet of my Master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor an instant tears seemed about to start from Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, but she\nrepressed the emotion, if it were such, and answered with impetuosity,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Master! who is your Master? what know I of your Master? what have\nyou ever told me of your Master? I suppose it is an esoteric doctrine\nwhich I am not worthy to know; but so it is, here you have been again and\nagain, and talked freely of many things, yet I am in as much darkness\nabout your Master as if I had never seen you. I know He died; I know too\nthat Christians say He lives. In some fortunate island, I suppose; for,\nwhen I have asked, you have got rid of the subject as best you could. You\nhave talked about your law and your various duties, and what you consider\nright, and what is forbidden, and of some of the old writers of your sect,\nand of the Jews before them; but if, as you imply, my wants and\naspirations are the same as yours, what have you done towards satisfying\nthem? what have you done for that Master towards whom you now propose to\nlead me? No!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, starting up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have watched those wants\nand aspirations for yourself, not for Him; you have taken interest in\nthem, you have cherished them, as if you were the author, you the object\nof them. You profess to believe in One True God, and to reject every\nother; and now you are implying that the Hand, the Shadow of that God is\non my mind and heart. Who is this God? where? how? in what? O Agellius,\nyou have stood in the way of Him, ready to speak for yourself, using Him\nas a means to an end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Callista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, in an agitated voice, when he could speak,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo my ears hear aright? do you really wish to be taught who the true God\nis?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, mistake me not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried passionately, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no such wish. I\ncould not be of your religion. Ye Gods! how have I been deceived! I\nthought every Christian was like Chione. I thought there could not be a\ncold Christian. Chione spoke as if a Christian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first thoughts were\ngoodwill to others; as if his state were of such blessedness, that his\ndearest heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish was to bring others into it. Here is a man who, so\nfar from feeling himself blest, thinks I can bless him! comes to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094me,\nCallista, a herb of the field, a poor weed, exposed to every wind of\nheaven, and shrivelling before the fierce sun\u00e2\u0080\u0094to me he comes to repose his\nheart upon. But as for any blessedness he has to show me, why, since he\ndoes not feel any himself, no wonder he has none to give away. I thought a\nChristian was superior to time and place; but all is hollow. Alas, alas, I\nam young in life to feel the force of that saying, with which sages go out\nof it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Vanity and hollowness!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Agellius, when I first heard you were a\nChristian, how my heart beat! I thought of her who was gone; and at first\nI thought I saw her in you, as if there had been some magical sympathy\nbetween you and her; and I hoped that from you I might have learned more\nof that strange strength which my nature needs, and which she told me she\npossessed. Your words, your manner, your looks were altogether different\nfrom others who came near me. But so it was; you came, and you went, and\ncame again; I thought it reserve, I thought it timidity, I thought it the\ncaution of a persecuted sect; but O, my disappointment, when first I saw\nin you indications that you were thinking of me only as others think, and\nfelt towards me as others may feel; that you were aiming at me, not at\nyour God; that you had much to tell of yourself, but nothing of Him! Time\nwas I might have been led to worship you, Agellius; you have hindered it\nby worshipping _me_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is not often, we suppose, that such deep offence is given to a lady by\nthe sort of admiration of which Agellius had been guilty in the case of\nCallista; however, startled as he might be, and startled and stung he was,\nthere was too much earnestness in her distress, too much of truth in her\nrepresentations, too much which came home to his heart and conscience, to\nallow of his being affronted or irritated. She had but supplied the true\ninterpretation of the misgiving which had haunted him that morning, from\nthe time he set out till the moment of his entering the room. Jucundus\nsome days back had readily acquiesced in his assurance that he was not\ninconsistent; but Callista had not been so indulgent, though really more\nmerciful. There was a pause in the conversation, or rather in her\noutpouring; each had bitter thoughts, and silently devoured them. At\nlength, she began again:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo the religion of Chione is a dream; now for four years I had hoped it\nwas a reality. All things again are vanity; I had hoped there was\nsomething somewhere more than I could see; but there is nothing. Here am I\na living, breathing woman, with an over-flowing heart, with keen\naffections, with a yearning after some object which may possess me. I\ncannot exist without something to rest upon. I cannot fall back upon that\ndrear, forlorn state, which philosophers call wisdom, and moralists call\nvirtue. I cannot enrol myself a votary of that cold Moon, whose arrows do\nbut freeze me. I cannot sympathize in that majestic band of sisters whom\nRome has placed under the tutelage of Vesta. I must have something to\nlove; love is my life. Why do you come to me, Agellius, with your\nevery-day gallantry. Can you compete with the noble Grecian forms which\nhave passed before my eyes? Is your voice more manly, are its tones more\neloquent, than those which have thrilled through my ears since I ceased to\nbe a child? Can you add perfume to the feast by your wit, or pour sunshine\nover grot and rushing stream by your smile? _What_ can you give me? There\nwas one thing which I thought you _could_ have given me, better than\nanything else; but it is a shadow. You have nothing to give. You have\nthrown me back upon my dreary, dismal self, and the deep wounds of my\nmemory.... Poor, poor Agellius! but it was not his fault, it could not be\nhelped,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, as if in thought; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit could not be helped; for, if\nhe had nothing to give, how could he give it? After all, he wanted\nsomething to love, just as I did; and he could find nothing better than\nme.... And they thought to persuade her to spend herself upon him, as she\nhad spent herself upon others. Yes, it was Jucundus and Aristo\u00e2\u0080\u0094my brother,\neven my own brother. They thought not of _me_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here her tears gushed out\nviolently, and she abandoned herself to a burst of emotion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were\nthinking of _him_. I had hoped he could lead me to what was higher; but\nwoe, woe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, wringing her hands, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey thought I was only fit to\nbring him low. Well; after all, _is_ Callista really good for much more\nthan the work they have set her to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was absorbed in her own misery in an intense sense of degradation, in\na keen consciousness of the bondage of nature, in a despair of ever\nfinding what alone could give meaning to her existence, and an object to\nher intellect and affections. And Agellius on the other hand, what\nsurprise, remorse, and humiliation came upon him! It was a strange\ncontrast, the complaint of nature unregenerate on the one hand, the\nself-reproach of nature regenerate and lapsing on the other. At last he\nspoke, and they were his last words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever injury I may have unwillingly inflicted\nupon you, you at least have returned me good for evil, and have made\nyourself my benefactress. Certainly, I now know myself better than I did;\nand He who has made use of you as His instrument of mercy towards me, will\nnot forget to reward you tenfold. One word will I say for myself; nay, not\nfor myself, but for my Master. Do not for an instant suppose that what you\nthought of the Christian religion is not true. It reveals a present God,\nwho satisfies every affection of the heart, yet keeps it pure. I serve a\nMaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, blushing from modesty and earnestness as he spoke,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI serve a Master whose love is stronger than created love. God help my\ninconsistency! but I never meant to love you as I love Him. You are\ndestined for His love. I commit you to Him, your true Lord, whom I never\nought to have rivalled, for whom I ought simply to have pleaded. Though I\nam not worthy to approach you, I shall trace you at a distance, who knows\nwhere? perhaps even to the prison and to the arena of those who confess\nthe Saviour of men, and dare to suffer and die for His name. And now,\nfarewell; to His keeping and that of His holy martyrs I commit you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not trust himself to look at her as he turned to the door, and left\nthe room.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XII.\n\n\n                                 A DEATH.\n\n\nThe first stages of repentance are but a fever, in which there is\nrestlessness and thirst, hot and cold fits, vague, dreary dreams, long\ndarkness which seems destined never to have a morning, effort without\nresult, and collapse without reaction. These symptoms had already\nmanifested themselves in Agellius; he spoke calmly to Callista, and\nsustained himself by the claims of the moment; but no sooner had he left\nthe room and was thrown upon himself, than his self-possession left him,\nand he fell into an agony, or rather anarchy of tumultuous feelings. Then\nrose up before his mind a hundred evil spectres, not less scaring and more\nreal than the dreams of the delirious. He thought of the singular favour\nwhich had been shown him in his reception into the Christian fold, and\nthat at so early a date; of the myriads all around who continued in\nheathenism as they had been born, and of his utter insensibility to his\nown privilege. He felt how much would be required of him, and how little\nhitherto had been forthcoming. He thought of the parable of the barren\nfig-tree, and the question was whispered in his ear whether it would not\nbe fulfilled in him. He asked himself in what his heart and his conduct\ndiffered from the condition of a fairly virtuous heathen. And then he\nthought of Callista in contrast with himself, as having done more with the\nmite which she possessed than he had done with many pounds. He felt that\nTyre and Sidon were rising up against him in her person; or rather how the\nsaying seemed about to be verified in her, that strangers should sit down\nin the kingdom from far countries, while those who were the heirs should\nbe thrust out. He had been rebuked by one to whom he rather ought to have\nbrought self-knowledge and compunction, and she was sensitively alive to\nhis want of charity. She had felt bitterly that she was left in ignorance\nand sin by one who had what she had not. She had accused him of being\nzealous enough to win her to himself, when he had shown no zeal at all to\nwin her to her Maker. If she was brought to the truth at length, there\nwould be no thanks to him for the happy change; yet on the other hand,\nthough he had predicted it, alas! was it likely that it would be granted?\nHad she not had her opportunity, which was lost because he had not\nimproved it? Yes, she had with a deliberate mind and in set words put\naside and taken leave of that which she once desired and hoped might have\nbeen her own, sorrowfully indeed, but peremptorily, as firmly persisting\nin rejecting it, as she might have persisted in maintaining it; and, if\nshe died in infidelity, horrible thought! would not the burden lie on him,\nand was this to be the token of the love which he pretended to entertain\nfor her?\n\nWhat was he living for? what was the work he had set himself to do? Did he\nlive to plant flowers, or to rear fruit, to maintain himself and to make\nmoney? Was that a time to pride himself on vineyards and oliveyards, when,\nlike Eliseus, he was one among myriads who were in unbelief? Ah, the\ndifference between a saint and him? Of what good was he on earth; why\nshould not he die? why so chary of his life? why preserve his wretched\nlife at all? Could he not do more by giving it than by keeping it? Might\nit not have been given him perchance for the very purpose that he might\nsacrifice it for Him who had given it? He had been timid about making a\nprofession of his faith, which might have led to prison and death; but\nperhaps the very object of his life in the divine purpose, the very reason\nof his birth, had been that, as soon as he was grown, he should die for\nthe truth. He might have been cut off by disease; he was not; and why,\nexcept that he might merit in his death, and that what, in the ordinary\ncourse of things, was a mere suffering, might in his case be an act of\nservice? His death might have been the conversion of thousands, of\nCallista; and the fewness of his days here would have been his claim to a\nblessed eternity hereafter.\n\nNor Callista alone; he had natural friends, with nearer claims upon his\ncharity. Had he been other than he was, he might have prevailed with his\nuncle; at least he might have taught him to respect the Christian Faith\nand Name, and restrained him from daring to attempt, for he now saw that\nit was an attempt, to seduce him into sin. He might have lodged a good\nseed in his heart, which in the hour of sickness might have germinated.\nAnd his brother again had learned to despise him; indeed he had raised in\nevery one who came near him the suspicion that he was not really a\nChristian, that he was an apostate (he could not help uttering a cry of\nanguish as he used the word), an apostate from that which was his real\nlife and supreme worship.\n\nWhy did he not at once go into the Basilica or the Gymnasium, and proclaim\nhimself a Christian? There were rumours abroad that the new emperor was\nbeginning a new policy towards his religion; let him inaugurate it in\nAgellius. Might he not thus perchance wash out his sin? He would be led\ninto the amphitheatre, as his betters had been led before him; the crowds\nwould yell, and the lion would be let loose upon him. He would confront\nthe edict, tear it down, be seized by the apparitor, and hurried to the\nrack or the slow fire. Callista would hear of it, and would learn at\nlength he was not quite the craven and the recreant which she thought him.\n\nThen his thoughts took a turn. Callista! what was Callista to him? Why\nshould he think of her, when she was girding him to martyrdom? Was she to\nbe the motive which was to animate him, and her praise his reward? Alas,\nalas! could he gain heaven by pleasing a heathen? \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut to whom then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncontinued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cam I to look up? who is to give me sympathy? who is to\nencourage, to advise me? O my Father, pity me! a feeble child, a poor,\noutcast, wandering sheep, away from the fold, torn by the briars and\nthorns, and no one to bind his wounds and retrace his steps for him. Why\nam I thus alone in the world? why am I without a pastor and guide? Ah, was\nnot this my fault in remaining in Sicca? I have no tie here; let me go to\nCarthage, or to Tagaste, or to Madaura, or to Hippo. I am not fit to walk\nthe world by myself; I am too simple, and am no match for its artifices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere another thought took possession of him, which had as yet but crossed\nhis mind, and it made him colour up with confusion and terror. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were\nlaying a plot for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy uncle and Aristo; and it is Callista\nwho has defeated it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as he spoke, he felt how much he owed to her,\nand how dangerous too it was to think of his debt. Yet it would not be\nwrong to pray for her; she had marred the device of which she was to have\nbeen the agent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLaqueus contritus est, et nos liberati sumus:\u00e2\u0080\u009d the net\nwas broken and he was delivered. She had refused his devotion, that he\nmight give it to his God; and now he would only think of her, and whisper\nher name, when he was kneeling before the Blessed Mary, his advocate. O\nthat that second and better Eve, who brought salvation into the world, as\nour first mother brought death, O that she might bear Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name in\nremembrance, and get it written in the Book of life!\n\nIt was high noon; and all this time Agellius was walking in his present\nexcited mood, without covering to his head, under the burning rays of the\nsun, not knowing which way he went, and retracing his steps, as he\nwandered about at random, with a vague notion he was going homewards. The\nfew persons whom he met, creeping about under the shadow of the lofty\nhouses, or under the porticoes of the temples, looked at him with wonder,\nand thought him furious or deranged. The shafts of the sun were not so hot\nas his own thoughts, or as the blood which shot to and fro so fiercely in\nhis veins; but they were working fearfully on his physical frame, though\nthey could not increase the fever of his mind. He had come to the Forum;\nthe market people were crouching under their booths or the shelter of\ntheir baskets. The riffraff of the city, who lived by their wits, or by\nodd jobs, or on the windfalls of the market; lazy fellows who did nothing,\nwho did not move till hunger urged them, like the brute; half-idiotic\nchewers of opium, ragged or rather naked children, the butcher boys and\nscavengers of the temples, lay at their length at the mouth of the caverns\nformed by the precipitous rock, or under the Arch of Triumph, or amid the\ncolumns of the Gymnasium and the Heracleum, or in the doorways of the\nshops. A scattering of beggars were lying, poor creatures, on their backs\nin the blazing sun, reckless of the awful maladies, the fits, the\nseizures, and the sudden death, which might be the consequence.\n\nNumbers out of this mixed multitude were asleep; some were looking with\ndull listless eyes at the still scene, or at any accidental movements\nwhich might vary it. They saw a figure coming nearer and nearer and wildly\npassing by. Just then Agellius was diverted from his painful meditations\nby hearing one of these fellows say to another, as he roused from a sort\nof doze, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of them. We know them all, but very poor pickings can\nbe got out of them; but he has more than most. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a low set in\nSicca.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then the man cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook sharp, young chap! the Furies\nare at your heels, and the Fates are going before you. Look there at the\nemperor; he is looking at you, as grim and sour as you could wish him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nspoke of the equestrian statue of Severus before the Basilica on the\nright; and, attracted by his words, Agellius went up to a board which was\nfixed to its base. It was an imperial edict, and it ran as follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCneius Trajanus Decius, Augustus; and Quintus Herennius Etruscus Decius,\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar; Emperors, unconquerable and pious; by united council these:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhereas we have experienced the benefits and the gifts of the gods, and\ndo also enjoy the victory which they have given us over our enemies, and\nmoreover salubrity of seasons, and abundance in the fruits of the earth;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherefore, acknowledging the aforesaid as our benefactors and the\nproviders of those things which are necessary for the commonwealth, we\nmake this our decree, that every class of the state, freemen and slaves,\nthe army and civilians, offer to the gods expiatory sacrifices, falling\ndown in supplication before them;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if any one shall presume to disobey this our divine command, which we\nunite in promulgating, we order that man to be thrown into chains, and to\nbe subjected to various tortures;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd should he thereupon be persuaded to reverse his disobedience, he\nshall receive from us no slight honours;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut should he hold out in opposition, first he shall have many tortures,\nand then shall be executed by the sword, or thrown into the deep sea, or\ngiven as a prey to birds and dogs;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd more than all if such a person be a professor of the Christian\nreligion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell, and live happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man in the fable called on Death, and Death made his appearance.\nWe are very far indeed from meaning that Agellius uttered random words, or\nspoke impatiently, when he just now expressed a wish to have the\nopportunity of dying for the Faith. Nevertheless, what now met his eyes\nand was transmitted through them, sentence by sentence, into his mind, was\nnot certainly of a nature to calm the tumult which was busy in breast and\nbrain; a sickness came over him, and he staggered away. The words of the\nedict still met his eyes, and were of a bright red colour. The sun was\nright before him, but the letters were in the sun, and the sun in his\nbrain. He reeled and fell heavily on the pavement. No notice was taken of\nthe occurrence by the spectators around him. They lazily or curiously\nlooked on, and waited to see if he would recover.\n\nHow long he lay there he could not tell, when he came to himself; if it\ncould really be said to be coming to himself to have the power of motion,\nand an instinct that he must move, and move in one direction. He managed\nto rise and lean against the pedestal of the statue, and its shade by this\ntime protected him. Then an intense desire came upon him to get home, and\nthat desire gave him a temporary preternatural strength. It came upon him\nas a duty to leave Sicca for his cottage, and he set off. He had a\nconfused notion that he must do his duty, and go straight forward, and\nturn neither to the right, nor the left, and stop nowhere, but move on\nsteadily for his true home. But next an impression came upon him that he\nwas running away from persecution, and that this ought not to be, and that\nhe ought to face the enemy, or at least not to hide from him, but meekly\nwait for him.\n\nAs he went along the narrow streets which led down the hill towards the\ncity gate this thought came so powerfully upon him that at length he sat\ndown on a stone which projected from an open shop, and thought of\nsurrendering himself. He felt the benefit of the rest, and this he fancied\nto be the calm of conscience consequent upon self-surrender and\nresignation. It was a fruiterer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stall, and the owner, seeing his\nexhaustion, offered him some slices of a water-melon for his refreshment.\nHe ate one of them, and then again a vague feeling came on him that he was\nin danger of idolatry, and must protest against idolatry, and that he\nought not to remain in the neighbourhood of temptation. So, throwing down\nthe small coin which was sufficient for payment, he continued his journey.\nThe rest and the refreshment of the fruit, and the continued shade which\nthe narrow street allowed him, allayed the fever, and for the time\nrecruited him, and he moved on languidly. The sun, however, was still high\nin heaven, and when he got beyond the city beat down upon his head from a\ncloudless sky. He painfully toiled up the ascent which led to his cottage.\nHe had nearly gained the gate of his homestead; he saw his old household\nslave, born in his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, a Christian like himself, coming to\nmeet him. A dizziness came over him, he lost his senses, and fell down\nhelplessly upon the bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n                            AND RESURRECTION.\n\n\nJucundus was quite as much amused as provoked at the result of the\ndelicate negotiation in which he had entangled his nephew. It was a\ngratification to him to find that its ill success had been owing in no\nrespect to any fault on the side of Agellius. He had done his part without\nshrinking, and the view which he, Jucundus, had taken of his state of\nmind, was satisfactorily confirmed. He had nothing to fear from Agellius,\nand though he had failed in securing the guarantee which he had hoped for\nhis attachment to things as they were, yet in the process of failure it\nhad been proved that his nephew might be trusted without it. And it was a\nquestion, whether a girl so full of whims and caprices as Callista might\nafter all have done him any permanent good. The absurd notion, indeed, of\nher having a leaning for Christianity had been refuted by her conduct on\nthe occasion; still, who could rely on a clever and accomplished Greek?\nThere were secret societies and conspiracies in abundance, and she might\nhave involved so weak and innocent a fellow in some plans against the\ngovernment, now or at a future time; or might have alienated him from his\nuncle, or in some way or other made a fool of him, if she had consented to\nhave him for her slave. Why she had rejected so eligible a suitor it was\nnow useless and idle to inquire; it might be that the haughty or greedy\nGreek had required him to bid higher for her favourable notice. If the\nnegotiation had taken such a turn, then indeed there was still more\ngratifying evidence of Agellius having broken from his fantastic and\npeevish superstition.\n\nStill, however, he was not without anxiety, now that the severe measures\ndirected against the Christians were in progress. No overt act, indeed,\nbeyond the publication of the edict, had been taken in Sicca\u00e2\u0080\u0094probably\nwould be taken at all. The worst was, that something must be done to make\na show; he could have wished that some of the multitude of townspeople,\nhalf suspected of Christianity, had stood firm, and suffered themselves to\nbe tortured and executed. One or two would have been enough; but the\nmagistracy got no credit with the central government for zeal and activity\nif no Christians were made an example of. Yet still it was a question\nwhether the strong acts at Carthage and elsewhere would not suffice,\nthough the lesser towns did nothing. At least, while the populace was\nquiet, there was nothing to press for severity. There were no rich\nChristians in Sicca to tempt the cupidity of the informer or of the\nmagistrate; no political partisans among them, who had made enemies with\nthis or that class of the community. But, supposing a bad feeling to rise\nin the populace, supposing the magistrates to have ill-wishers and\nrivals\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what men in power had not?\u00e2\u0080\u0094who might be glad to catch them\ntripping, and make a case against them at Rome, why, it must be confessed\nthat Agellius was nearly the only victim who could be pitched upon. He\nwished Callista no harm, but, if a Christian must be found and held up _in\nterrorem_, he would rather it was a person like her, without connections\nand home, than the member of any decent family of Sicca, whose fair fame\nwould be compromised by a catastrophe. However, she was _not_ a Christian,\nand Agellius _was_, at least by profession; and his fear was lest Juba\nshould be right in his estimate of his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character. Juba had said\nthat Agellius could be as obstinate as he was ordinarily indolent and\nyielding, and Jucundus dreaded lest, if he were rudely charged with\nChristianity, and bidden to renounce it under pain of punishment, he would\nrebel against the tyrannical order, and go to prison and to death out of\nsheer perverseness or sense of honour.\n\nWith these perplexities before him, he could find nothing better than the\nfollowing plan of action, which had been in his mind for some time. While\nthe edict remained inoperative, he would do nothing at all, and let\nAgellius go on with his country occupations, which would keep him out of\nthe way. But if any disposition appeared of a popular commotion, or a\nmovement on the part of the magistracy, he determined to get possession of\nAgellius, and forcibly confine him in his own house in Sicca. He hoped\nthat in the case of one so young, so uncommitted, he should have influence\nwith the municipal authorities, or at the pr\u00c3\u00a6torium, or in the camp (for\nthe camp and the pr\u00c3\u00a6torium were under different jurisdictions in the\nproconsulate), to shelter Agellius from a public inquiry into his\nreligious tenets, or if this could not be, to smuggle him out of the city.\nHe was ready to affirm solemnly that his nephew was no Christian, though\nhe was touched in the head, and, from an affection parallel to\nhydrophobia, to which the disciples of Galen ought to turn their\nattention, was sent into convulsions on the sight of an altar. His father,\nindeed, was a malignant old atheist\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was no harm in being angry with\nthe dead\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it was very hard the son should suffer for his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\noffence. If he must be judged of by his parents, let him rather have the\nadvantage of the thorough loyalty and religiousness of his mother, a most\nzealous old lady, in high repute in the neighbourhood of Sicca for her\ntheurgic knowledge, a staunch friend of the imperial government, which had\nbefore now been indebted to her for important information, and as staunch\na hater of the Christians. Such was the plan of proceedings resolved on by\nJucundus before he received the news of his nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s serious malady. It\ndid not reach him till many days after; and then he did not go to see him,\nfirst, lest he should be supposed to be in communication with him, next,\nas having no respect for that romantic sort of generosity which risks the\nchances of contagion for the absurd ceremony of paying a compliment.\n\nIt was thus that Jucundus addressed himself to the present state of\naffairs, and anticipated the chances of the future. As to Aristo, he had\nvery little personal interest in the matter. His sister might have\nthwarted him in affairs which lay nearer his heart than the moral\nemancipation of Agellius; and as she generally complied with his\nsuggestions and wishes, whatever they were, he did not grudge her her\nliberty of action in this instance. Nor had the occurrence which had taken\nplace any great visible effect upon Callista herself. She had lost her\nright to be indignant with her brother, and she resigned or rather\nabandoned herself to her destiny. Her better feelings had been brought out\nfor the moment in her conversation with Agellius; but they were not\nordinary ones. True, she was tired, but she was the slave of the world;\nand Agellius had only made her more sceptical than before that there was\nany service better. So at least she said to herself; she said it was\nfantastic to go elsewhere for good, and that, if life was short, then, as\nher brother said, it was necessary to make the most of it.\n\n\n\nAnd meanwhile, what of Agellius himself? Why, it will be some little time\nbefore Agellius will be in a condition to moralize upon anything. His\nfaithful slave half-carried, half-drew him into the cottage, and stretched\nhim upon his bed. Then, having sufficient skill for the ordinary illnesses\nof the country, though this was more than an ordinary fever, he drew blood\nfrom him, gave him a draught of herbs, and left him to the slow but safe\nprocesses of nature to restore him. It could not be affirmed that he was\nnot in considerable danger of life, yet youth carries hope with it, and\nhis attendant had little to fear for his recovery. For some days certainly\nAgellius had no apprehension of anything, except of restlessness and\ndistress, of sleepless nights, or dreary, miserable dreams. At length one\nmorning, as he was lying on his back with his eyes shut, it came into his\nmind to ask himself whether Sunday would ever come. He had been accustomed\nupon the first day of the week to say some particular prayers and psalms,\nand unite himself in spirit with his brethren beyond seas. And then he\ntried to remember the last Sunday; and the more he thought, the less he\ncould remember it, till he began to think that months had gone without a\nSunday. This he was certain of, that he had lost reckoning, for he had\nmade no notches for the days for a long while past, and unless his slave\nAsper knew, there was no one to tell him. Here he got so puzzled, that it\nwas like one of the bad dreams which had worried him. He felt it affect\nhis head, and he was obliged to give up the inquiry.\n\nFrom this time his sleep was better and more refreshing for several days;\nhe was more collected when he was awake, and was able to ask himself why\nhe lay there, and what had happened to him. Then gradually his memory\nbegan to return like the dawning of the day; the cause and the\ncircumstances of his recent visit to the city, point after point came up,\nand he felt first wonder, and then certainty. He recollected the Forum,\nand then the edict; a solemn, overpowering emotion here seized him, and\nfor a while he dared not think more. When he recovered, and tried to\npursue the events of the day, he found himself unequal to the task; all\nwas dark, except that he had some vague remembrance of thirsting, and some\none giving him to drink, and then his saying with the Psalmist,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTransivimus per ignem et aquam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe opened his eyes and looked about him. He was at home. There was some\none at the bed-head whom he could not see hanging over him, and he was too\nweak to raise himself and so command a view of him. He waited patiently,\nbeing too feeble to have any great anxiety on the subject. Presently a\nvoice addressed him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are recovering, my son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are _you_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius abruptly. The person spoken to applied his\nmouth to Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear, and uttered lowly several sacred names.\n\nAgellius would have started up had he been strong enough; he could but\nsink down upon his rushes in agitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe content to know no more at present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpraise God,\nas I do. You know enough for your present strength. It is your act of\nobedience for the day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a deep, clear, peaceful, authoritative voice. In his present state,\nas we have said, it cost Agellius no great effort to mortify curiosity;\nand the accents of that voice soothed him, and the mystery employed his\nmind, and had something pleasing and attractive in it. Moreover, about the\nmain point there was no mystery, and could be no mistake, that he was in\nthe hands of a Christian ecclesiastic.\n\nThe stranger occupied himself for a time with a book of prayers which he\ncarried about him, and then again with the duties of a sick-bed. He\nsprinkled vinegar over Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and about the room, and supplied\nhim with the refreshment of cooling fruit. He kept the flies from\ntormenting him, and did his best so to arrange his posture that he might\nsuffer least from his long lying. In the morning and evening he let in the\nair, and he excluded the sultry noon. In these various occupations he was\nfrom time to time removed to a distance from the patient, who thus had an\nopportunity of observing him. The stranger was of middle height, upright,\nand well proportioned; he was dressed in a peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or slave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark\ntunic. His face was rather round than long; his hair black, yet with the\npromise of greyness, with what might be baldness in the crown, or a\npriest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tonsure. His short beard curled round his chin; his complexion\nwas very clear. But the most striking point about him was his eyes; they\nwere of a light or greyish blue, transparent, and shining like precious\nstones.\n\nFrom the day that they first interchanged words, the priest said some\nshort prayers from time to time with Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prayer, and\nportions of the Psalms. Afterwards, when he was well enough to converse,\nAgellius was struck with the inexpressible peculiarity of his manner. It\nwas self-collected, serene, gentle, tender, unobtrusive, unstudied. It\nenabled him to say things severe and even stern, without startling,\noffending, or repelling the hearer. He spoke very little about himself,\nthough from time to time points of detail were elicited of his history in\nthe course of conversation. He said that his name was C\u00c3\u00a6cilius. Asper,\nwhen he entered the room, would kneel down and offer to kiss the\nstranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sandal, though the latter generally managed to prevent it.\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius did not speak much about himself; but Agellius, on the other\nhand, found it a relief to tell out his own history, and reflect upon and\ndescribe his own feelings. As he lay on his bed, he half soliloquized,\nhalf addressed himself to the stranger. Sometimes he required an answer;\nsometimes he seemed to require none. Once he asked suddenly, after a long\nsilence, whether a man could be baptized twice; and when the priest\nanswered distinctly in the negative, Agellius replied that if so, he\nthought it would be best never to be baptized till the hour of death. It\nwas a question, he said, which had perplexed him a good deal, but he never\nhad had any one to converse with on the subject.\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how could you promise yourself that you would be\nable to obtain the sacrament at the last moment? The water and the\nadministrator might come just too late; and then where would you be, my\nson? And then again, how do you know you would wish it? Is your will\nsimply in your own power? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Carpe diem;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 take God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gift while you can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe benefit is so immense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat one would wish, if\none could, to enter into the unseen world without losing its fulness. This\ncannot be, if a long time elapses between baptism and death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are, then, of the number of those,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho would cheat\ntheir Maker of His claim on their life, provided they could (as it is\nsaid) in their last moment cheat the devil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius continuing silent, C\u00c3\u00a6cilius added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to enjoy this world,\nand to inherit the next; is it so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am puzzled, my head is weak, father; I do not see my way to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPresently he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSin after baptism is so awful a matter; there is no\nsecond laver for sin; and then again, to sin against baptism is so great a\nsin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe priest said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn baptism God becomes your Father; your own God; your\nworship; your love\u00e2\u0080\u0094can you give up this great gift all through your life?\nWould you live \u00e2\u0080\u0098without God in this world\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTears came into Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, and his throat became oppressed. At last\nhe said, distinctly and tenderly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a while the priest said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose what you fear is the fire of\njudgment, and the prison; not lest you should fall away and be lost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, my dear father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the sick youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I have no right\nto reckon on anything, or promise myself anything; yet somehow I have\nnever feared hell\u00e2\u0080\u0094though I ought, I know I ought; but I have not. I\ndeserve the worst, but somehow I have thought that God would lead me on.\nHe ever has done so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you fear the fire of judgment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d put off\nbaptism for fear of that fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not say I _would_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted _you_ to explain\nthe thing to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich would you rather, Agellius, be without God here, or suffer the fire\nthere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius smiled; he said faintly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take Him for my portion here _and_\nthere: _He_ will be in the fire with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius lay quiet for some hours, and seemed asleep. Suddenly he began\nagain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was baptized when I was only six years old. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you do not\nthink it was wilful in me, and wrong. I cannot tell what took me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\npresently continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a fervour; I have had nothing of the kind\nsince. What does our Lord say? I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Novissima pejora\nprioribus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe continued the train of thought another day, or rather the course of his\nargument; for on the thought itself his mind seemed ever to be working.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy spring is gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I have no summer. Nay, I have had no\nspring; it was a day, not a season. It came, and it went; where am I now?\nCan spring ever return? I wish to begin again in right earnest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank God, my son, for this great mercy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, though\nyou have relaxed, you have never severed yourself from the peace of the\nChurch, you have not denied your God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius sighed bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Erravi, sicut ovis\nqu\u00c3\u00a6 periit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I have been very near denying Him, at least by outward act.\nYou do not know me; you cannot know what has come on me lately. And I dare\nnot look back on it, my heart is so weak. My father, how am I to repent of\nwhat is past, when I dare not think of it? To think of it is to renew the\nsin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Puer meus, noli timere,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the priest; \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098si transieris per\nignem, odor ejus non erit in te.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 In penance, the grace of God carries you\nwithout harm through thoughts and words which _would_ harm you apart from\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, penance!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI recollect the catechism. What is it,\nfather? a new grace, I know; a plank after baptism. May I have it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not strong enough yet to think of these things, Agellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nanswered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease God, you shall get well. Then you shall review\nall your life, and bring it out in order before Him; and He, through me,\nwill wipe away all that has been amiss. Praise Him who has spared you for\nthis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was too much for the patient in his weak state; he could but shed happy\ntears.\n\nAnother day he had sat up in bed. He looked at his hands, from which the\nskin was peeling; he felt his lips, and it was with them the same; and his\nhair seemed coming off also. He smiled and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRenovabitur, ut aquila,\njuventus mea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius responded, as before, with sacred words which were new to\nAgellius: \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Qui sperant in Domino mutabunt fortitudinem; assument pennas,\nsicut aquil\u00c3\u00a6,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sursum corda!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you must soar, Agellius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sursum corda!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know those words. They are old\nfriends; where have I heard them? I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recollect; but they are in my\nearliest memories. Ah! but, my father, my heart is below, not above. I\nwant to tell you all. I want to tell you about one who has enthralled my\nheart; who has divided it with my True Love. But I daren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak of her,\nas I have said; I dare not speak, lest I be carried away. O, I blush to\nsay it; she is a heathen! May God save her soul! Will He come to me, and\nnot to her? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Investigabiles vi\u00c3\u00a6 ejus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe remained silent for some time; then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFather, I mean to\ndedicate myself to God, simply, absolutely, with His grace. I will be His,\nand He shall be mine. No one shall come between us. But O this weak\nheart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep your good resolves till you are stronger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\neasy to make them on a sick-bed. You must first reckon the charges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the passage, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and he repeated\nthe sacred words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf any man come to Me, and hate not his father and\nmother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his\nown life also, he cannot be My disciple.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother time Agellius said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Martyrs; surely the old bishop used to\nsay something about the Martyrs. He spoke of a second baptism, and called\nit a baptism of blood; and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Might his soul be with the Martyrs!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nFather, would not this wash out every thing, as the first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was now C\u00c3\u00a6cilius who smiled, and his eyes shone like the sapphires of\nthe Holy City; and he seemed the ideal of him who, when\n\n            \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalled upon to face\n  Some awful moment to which heaven has joined\n  Great issues, good or bad for humankind,\n  Is happy as a lover, and attired\n  With sudden brightness, like a man inspired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, he soon controlled himself, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuo ego vado, non potes me\nmodo sequi; sequeris autem postea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n                              A SMALL CLOUD.\n\n\nThis sort of intercourse, growing in frequency and fulness, went on for\nabout a week, till Agellius was able to walk with support, and to leave\nthe cottage. The priest and his own slave took him between them, and\nseated him one evening in sight of the glorious prospect, traversed by the\nlong shadow of the far mountains, behind which the sun was making its way.\nThe air was filled with a thousand odours; the brilliant colouring of the\nwestern heavens was contrasted with the more sober but varied tints of the\nrich country. The wheat and barley harvest was over; but the beans were\nlate, and still stood in the fields. The olives and chestnut-trees were\nfull of fruit; the early fig was supplying the markets with food; and the\nnumerous vineyards were patiently awaiting the suns of the next month\nslowly to perfect their present promise. The beautiful scene had a moral\ndignity, from its associations with human sustenance and well-being. The\ninexpressible calmness of evening was flung, like a robe, over it. Its\nsweetness was too much for one who had been confined to the monotony of a\nsick-room, and was still an invalid. He sat silent, and in tears. It was\nlife from the dead; and he felt he had risen to a different life. And thus\nhe came out evening after evening convalescent, gradually and surely\nadvancing to perfect restoration of his health.\n\nOne evening he said, after feeding his eyes and thoughts for some time\nwith the prospect, \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mansueti hereditabunt terram.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They alone have real\nenjoyment of this earth who believe in its Maker. Every breath of air\nseems to whisper how good He is to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese sights are the shadows of that fairer Paradise\nwhich is our home, where there is no beast of prey, no venomous reptile,\nno sin. My child, should _I_ not feel this more than you? Those who are\nshut up in crowded cities see but the work of man, which is evil. It is\nthe compensation of my flight from Carthage that I am brought before the\nface of God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe heathen worship all this, as if God Himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow\nstrange it seems to me that any one can forget the Creator in His works!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius was silent for a moment, and sighed; he then said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have ever\nbeen a Christian, Agellius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have not, my father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, you have earned that\ngrace which came to me freely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit comes freely to all; and is only merited\nwhen it has already prevailed. Yet I think you earned it too, else why the\ndifference between you and your brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you know of us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Agellius quickly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a great deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet something. Three or four years back\nan effort was made to rekindle the Christian spirit in these parts, and to\ndo something for the churches of the proconsulate, and to fill up the\nvacant sees. Nothing has come of it as yet; but steps were taken towards\nit: one was to obtain a recovery of the Christians who remained in them. I\nwas sent here for that purpose, and in this way heard of you and your\nbrother. When my life was threatened by the persecution, and I had to\nflee, I thought of your cottage. I was obliged to act secretly, as we did\nnot know friends from foes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were led here for other purposes towards _me_, my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nAgellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet you cannot have a safer refuge. There is nothing to\ndisturb, nothing to cause suspicion here. In this harvest time numbers of\nstrangers pour in from the mountains, of various races; there is nothing\nto distinguish you from one of them, and my brother is away convoying some\ngrain to Carthage. Persecution drove you hither, but you have not been\nsuffered to be idle, my father, you have brought home a wanderer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nadded, after a pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am well enough to go to confession to you now.\nMay it be this evening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow long I shall still be here, I\ncannot tell. I am expecting my trusty messenger with despatches. It is now\nthree days since he was here. However, this I say without misgiving, we do\nnot part for long. What do you here longer? you must come to me. I must\nprepare you, and send you back to Sicca, to collect and restore this\nscattered flock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius turned, and leaned against the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, and laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nam laughing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot from lightness of mind, but from the depth of\nsurprise and of joy that you should so think of me. It was a dream which\nonce I had; but impossible! you do not think that I, weak I, shall ever be\nable to do more than save my own soul?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will save your own soul by saving the souls of others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy child, I could tell you more things if I thought it good for\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my father, I have so weak, so soft a heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\nam I to do with myself? I am not of the temper of which heroes are made.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Virtus in infirmitate perficitur,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! are you to\ndo _any_ thing of yourself? or are you to be simply the instrument of\nAnother? We shall have the same termination, you and myself, but you long\nafter me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, father, because _you_ will burn out so much more quickly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nAgellius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see my messenger; there is some one who has\nmade his way by stealth into the garden, or at least not by the beaten\nway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere _was_ a visitor, as C\u00c3\u00a6cilius had said; however, it was not his\nmessenger, but Juba, who approached, looking with great curiosity at\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius, and absorbed in the sight. C\u00c3\u00a6cilius in turn regarded him\nsteadfastly, and then said to Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is your brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat brings you here, Juba?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the latter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been away on a distant errand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand find you have been\nill. Is this your nurse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he eyed him almost sternly, and added, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a\nChristian priest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas Agellius no acquaintance but Christians?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked C\u00c3\u00a6cilius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAcquaintance! O surely!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cagreeable, innocent, sweet\nacquaintance of another sort; myself to begin with. My lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou did not rise to their price, but you did your best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJuba,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you have any business here, say it, and have\ndone. I am not strong enough to hold any altercation with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBusiness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can find quite business enough here, if I\nchoose. This is a priest of the Christians. I am sure of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius looked at him with such calmness and benevolence, that at length\nJuba turned away his eyes with something of irritation. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I\n_am_ a priest, I am here to claim you as one of my children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJuba winced, but said scornfully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are mistaken there, father; speak\nto those who own you. I am a free man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d C\u00c3\u00a6cilius answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been under instruction; it is your\nduty to go forward, not back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you know about me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009che has been telling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour face, your manner, your voice, tells a tale; I need no information\nfrom others. I have heard of you years ago; now I see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you see in me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see pride in bodily shape, treading down faith and conviction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius.\n\nJuba neighed rather than laughed, so fierce and scornful was its\nexpression. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you slaves call pride,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI call dignity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou believe in a God, Creator of heaven and earth, as certainly as I do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you deliberately set yourself against Him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJuba smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as free,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin _my_ place, as He in His.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree to do wrong, and free to suffer for\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may call it wrong, and call it suffering,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut for me,\n_I_ do not call wrong what He calls wrong; and if He puts me to pain, it\nis because He is the stronger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe priest stopped awhile; there was no emotion on either side. It was\nstrange to see them so passionless, so antagonistic, like St. Michael and\nhis adversary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is that within you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich speaks as I speak. That\ninward voice takes the part of the Creator, and condemns you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_He_ put it there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand _I_ will take care to put it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen He will have justice as well as power on His side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never fawn or crouch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be lord and master in my\nown soul. Every faculty shall be mine; there shall be no divided\nallegiance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius paused again; he said at length, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy son, my soul tells me, or\nrather my Maker tells me, and your Maker, that some heavy judgment is\nimpending over you. Do penance while you may.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell your forebodings to women and children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am prepared\nfor anything. I will not be crushed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius was not strong enough to bear a part in such a scene. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is his way, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe him. He has better thoughts.\nAway with you, Juba, you are not wanted here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch words are not strange to me. I am not\nyoung, and have seen much of the world; and my very office and position\nelicits blasphemies from others from time to time. I knew a man who\ncarried out his bad thoughts and words into act. Abjuring his Maker, he\nabandoned himself to the service of the evil one. He betrayed his brethren\nto death. He lived on year after year, and became old. He was smitten with\nillness; then I first saw him. I made him contemplate a picture; it was\nthe picture of the Good Shepherd. I dwelt on the vain efforts of the poor\nsheep to get out of the fold; its irrational aversion to its home, and its\ndesperate resolution to force a way through the prickly fence. It was\npierced and torn with the sharp aloe; at last it lay imprisoned in its\nstern embrace, motionless and bleeding. Then the Shepherd, though He had\nto wound His own hands in the work, disengaged it, and brought it back.\nGod has His own times; His power went along with the picture, and the man\nwas moved. I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098_This_ is His return for your enmity: He is determined\nto have you, cost Him what it will.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I need not go through the many things\nthat followed, but the issue may be told in few words. He came back; he\nlived a life of penance at the Church\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door; he received the peace of the\nChurch in immediate prospect of the persecution, and has within the last\nten days died a martyr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJuba had listened as if he was constrained against his will. When the\npriest stopped he started, and began to speak impetuously, and unlike his\nordinary tone. He placed his hands violently against his ears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno more. _I_ will not betray them; no: I _need_ not betray them;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe laughed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe black moor does the work himself. Look,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried,\nseizing the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm, and pointing to a part of the forest, which\nhappened to be to windward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are in their number, priest, who can\nforetell the destinies of others, and are blind to their own. Read there,\nthe task is not hard, your coming fortunes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis finger was directed to a spot where, amid the thick foliage, the gleam\nof a pool or of a marsh was visible. The various waters round about\nissuing from the gravel, or drained from the nightly damps, had run into a\nhollow, filled with the decaying vegetation of former years, and were\nlanguidly filtered out into a brook, more healthy than the vast reservoir\nitself. Its banks were bordered with a deep, broad layer of mud, a\ntransition substance between the rich vegetable matter which it once had\nbeen, and the multitudinous world of insect life which it was becoming. A\ncloud or mist at this time was hanging over it, high in air. A harsh and\nshrill sound, a whizzing or a chirping, proceeded from that cloud to the\near of the attentive listener. What these indications portended was plain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis what will tell more against you than imperial\nedict, informer, or proconsular apparitor; and no work of mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned down the bank and disappeared. Agellius and his guest looked at\neach other in dismay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the locusts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they whispered to each other,\nas they went back into the cottage.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XV.\n\n\n                              A VISITATION.\n\n\nThe plague of locusts, one of the most awful visitations to which the\ncountries included in the Roman empire were exposed, extended from the\nAtlantic to Ethiopia, from Arabia to India, and from the Nile and Red Sea\nto Greece and the north of Asia Minor. Instances are recorded in history\nof clouds of the devastating insect crossing the Black Sea to Poland, and\nthe Mediterranean to Lombardy. It is as numerous in its species as it is\nwide in its range of territory. Brood follows brood, with a sort of family\nlikeness, yet with distinct attributes, as we read in the prophets of the\nOld Testament, from whom Bochart tells us it is possible to enumerate as\nmany as ten kinds. It wakens into existence and activity as early as the\nmonth of March; but instances are not wanting, as in our present history,\nof its appearance as late as June. Even one flight comprises myriads upon\nmyriads passing imagination, to which the drops of rain or the sands of\nthe sea are the only fit comparison; and hence it is almost a proverbial\nmode of expression in the East (as may be illustrated by the sacred pages\nto which we just now referred), by way of describing a vast invading army,\nto liken it to the locusts. So dense are they, when upon the wing, that it\nis no exaggeration to say that they hide the sun, from which circumstance\nindeed their name in Arabic is derived. And so ubiquitous are they when\nthey have alighted on the earth, that they simply cover or clothe its\nsurface.\n\nThis last characteristic is stated in the sacred account of the plagues of\nEgypt, where their faculty of devastation is also mentioned. The\ncorrupting fly and the bruising and prostrating hail had preceded them in\nthat series of visitations, but _they_ came to do the work of ruin more\nthoroughly. For not only the crops and fruits, but the foliage of the\nforest itself, nay, the small twigs and the bark of the trees are the\nvictims of their curious and energetic rapacity. They have been known even\nto gnaw the door-posts of the houses. Nor do they execute their task in so\nslovenly a way, that, as they have succeeded other plagues so they may\nhave successors themselves. They take pains to spoil what they leave. Like\nthe Harpies, they smear every thing that they touch with a miserable\nslime, which has the effect of a virus in corroding, or, as some say, in\nscorching and burning it. And then, as if all this were little, when they\ncan do nothing else, they die;\u00e2\u0080\u0094as if out of sheer malevolence to man, for\nthe poisonous elements of their nature are then let loose, and dispersed\nabroad, and create a pestilence; and they manage to destroy many more by\ntheir death than in their life.\n\nSuch are the locusts,\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose existence the ancient heretics brought forward\nas their palmary proof that there was an evil creator, and of whom an\nArabian writer shows his national horror, when he says that they have the\nhead of a horse, the eyes of an elephant, the neck of a bull, the horns of\na stag, the breast of a lion, the belly of a scorpion, the wings of an\neagle, the legs of a camel, the feet of an ostrich, and the tail of a\nserpent.\n\nAnd now they are rushing upon a considerable tract of that beautiful\nregion of which we have spoken with such admiration. The swarm to which\nJuba pointed grew and grew till it became a compact body, as much as a\nfurlong square; yet it was but the vanguard of a series of similar hosts,\nformed one after another out of the hot mould or sand, rising into the air\nlike clouds, enlarging into a dusky canopy, and then discharged against\nthe fruitful plain. At length the huge innumerous mass was put into\nmotion, and began its career, darkening the face of day. As became an\ninstrument of divine power, it seemed to have no volition of its own; it\nwas set off, it drifted, with the wind, and thus made northwards, straight\nfor Sicca. Thus they advanced, host after host, for a time wafted on the\nair, and gradually declining to the earth, while fresh broods were carried\nover the first, and neared the earth, after a longer flight, in their\nturn. For twelve miles did they extend from front to rear, and their\nwhizzing and hissing could be heard for six miles on every side of them.\nThe bright sun, though hidden by them, illumined their bodies, and was\nreflected from their quivering wings; and as they heavily fell earthward,\nthey seemed like the innumerable flakes of a yellow-coloured snow. And\nlike snow did they descend, a living carpet, or rather pall, upon fields,\ncrops, gardens, copses, groves, orchards, vineyards, olive woods,\norangeries, palm plantations, and the deep forests, sparing nothing within\ntheir reach, and where there was nothing to devour, lying helpless in\ndrifts, or crawling forward obstinately, as they best might, with the hope\nof prey. They could spare their hundred thousand soldiers twice or thrice\nover, and not miss them; their masses filled the bottoms of the ravines\nand hollow ways, impeding the traveller as he rode forward on his journey,\nand trampled by thousands under his horse-hoofs. In vain was all this\noverthrow and waste by the road-side; in vain their loss in river, pool,\nand watercourse. The poor peasants hastily dug pits and trenches as their\nenemy came on; in vain they filled them from the wells or with lighted\nstubble. Heavily and thickly did the locusts fall: they were lavish of\ntheir lives; they choked the flame and the water, which destroyed them the\nwhile, and the vast living hostile armament still moved on.\n\nThey moved right on like soldiers in their ranks, stopping at nothing, and\nstraggling for nothing: they carried a broad furrow or wheal all across\nthe country, black and loathsome, while it was as green and smiling on\neach side of them and in front, as it had been before they came. Before\nthem, in the language of prophets, was a paradise; and behind them a\ndesert. They are daunted by nothing; they surmount walls and hedges, and\nenter enclosed gardens or inhabited houses. A rare and experimental\nvineyard has been planted in a sheltered grove. The high winds of Africa\nwill not commonly allow the light trellis or the slim pole; but here the\nlofty poplar of Campania has been possible, on which the vine plant mounts\nso many yards into the air, that the poor grape-gatherers bargain for a\nfuneral pile and a tomb as one of the conditions of their engagement. The\nlocusts have done what the winds and lightning could not do, and the whole\npromise of the vintage, leaves and all, is gone, and the slender stems are\nleft bare. There is another yard, less uncommon, but still tended with\nmore than common care; each plant is kept within due bounds by a circular\ntrench round it, and by upright canes on which it is to trail; in an hour\nthe solicitude and long toil of the vine-dresser are lost, and his pride\nhumbled. There is a smiling farm; another sort of vine, of remarkable\ncharacter, is found against the farm-house. This vine springs from one\nroot, and has clothed and matted with its many branches the four walls;\nthe whole of it is covered thick with long clusters, which another month\nwill ripen:\u00e2\u0080\u0094on every grape and leaf there is a locust. Into the dry caves\nand pits, carefully strewed with straw, the harvest-men have (safely, as\nthey thought just now) been lodging the far-famed African wheat. One grain\nor root shoots up into ten, twenty, fifty, eighty, nay, three or four\nhundred stalks: sometimes the stalks have two ears apiece, and these again\nshoot into a number of lesser ones. These stores are intended for the\nRoman populace, but the locusts have been beforehand with them. The small\npatches of ground belonging to the poor peasants up and down the country,\nfor raising the turnips, garlic, barley, watermelons, on which they live,\nare the prey of these glutton invaders as much as the choicest vines and\nolives. Nor have they any reverence for the villa of the civic decurion or\nthe Roman official. The neatly arranged kitchen-garden, with its cherries,\nplums, peaches, and apricots, is a waste; as the slaves sit round, in the\nkitchen in the first court, at their coarse evening meal, the room is\nfilled with the invading force, and news comes to them that the enemy has\nfallen upon the apples and pears in the basement, and is at the same time\nplundering and sacking the preserves of quince and pomegranate, and\nrevelling in the jars of precious oil of Cyprus and Mendes in the\nstore-rooms.\n\nThey come up to the walls of Sicca, and are flung against them into the\nditch. Not a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitation or delay; they recover their footing,\nthey climb up the wood or stucco, they surmount the parapet, or they have\nentered in at the windows, filling the apartments, and the most private\nand luxurious chambers, not one or two, like stragglers at forage or\nrioters after a victory, but in order of battle, and with the array of an\narmy. Choice plants or flowers about the _impluvia_ and _xysti_, for\nornament or refreshment, myrtles, oranges, pomegranates, the rose and the\ncarnation, have disappeared. They dim the bright marbles of the walls and\nthe gilding of the ceilings. They enter the triclinium in the midst of the\nbanquet; they crawl over the viands and spoil what they do not devour.\nUnrelaxed by success and by enjoyment, onward they go; a secret mysterious\ninstinct keeps them together, as if they had a king over them. They move\nalong the floor in so strange an order that they seem to be a tesselated\npavement themselves, and to be the artificial embellishment of the place;\nso true are their lines, and so perfect is the pattern they describe.\nOnward they go, to the market, to the temple sacrifices, to the baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstores, to the cook-shops, to the confectioner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, to the druggists;\nnothing comes amiss to them; wherever man has aught to eat or drink, there\nare they, reckless of death, strong of appetite, certain of conquest.\n\nThey have passed on; the men of Sicca sadly congratulate themselves, and\nbegin to look about them, and to sum up their losses. Being the\nproprietors of the neighbouring districts, or the purchasers of its\nproduce, they lament over the devastation, not because the fair country is\ndisfigured, but because income is becoming scanty, and prices are becoming\nhigh. How is a population of many thousands to be fed? where is the grain,\nwhere the melons, the figs, the dates, the gourds, the beans, the grapes,\nto sustain and solace the multitudes in their lanes, caverns, and garrets?\nThis is another weighty consideration for the class well-to-do in the\nworld. The taxes, too, and contributions, the capitation tax, the\npercentage upon corn, the various articles of revenues due to Rome, how\nare they to be paid? How are cattle to be provided for the sacrifices and\nfor the tables of the wealthy? One-half, at least, of the supply of Sicca\nis cut off. No longer slaves are seen coming into the city from the\ncountry in troops with their baskets on their shoulders, or beating\nforward the horse, or mule, or ox, overladen with its burden, or driving\nin the dangerous cow, or the unresisting sheep. The animation of the place\nis gone; a gloom hangs over the Forum; and if its frequenters are still\nmerry there is something of sullenness and recklessness in their mirth.\nThe gods have given the city up; something or other has angered them.\nLocusts, indeed, are no uncommon visitation, but at an earlier season.\nPerhaps some temple has been polluted, or some unholy rite practised, or\nsome secret conspiracy has spread.\n\nAnother and a still worse calamity. The invaders, as we have already\nintimated, could be more terrible still in their overthrow than in their\nravages. The inhabitants of the country had attempted, where they could,\nto destroy them by fire and water. It would seem as if the malignant\nanimals had resolved that the sufferers should have the benefit of this\npolicy to the full; for they had not got more than twenty miles beyond\nSicca when they suddenly sickened and died. Thus after they had done all\nthe mischief they could by their living, when they had made their foul\nmaws the grave of every living thing, then they died themselves, and made\nthe desolated land their own grave. They took from it its hundred forms\nand varieties of beautiful life, and left it their own fetid and poisonous\ncarcases in payment. It was a sudden catastrophe; they seemed making for\nthe Mediterranean, as if, like other great conquerors, they had other\nworlds to subdue beyond it; but whether they were overgorged, or struck by\nsome atmospheric change, or that their time was come and they paid the\ndebt of nature, so it was that suddenly they fell, and their glory came to\nnought, and all was vanity to them as to others, and \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir stench rose\nup, and their corruption rose up, because they had done proudly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe hideous swarms lay dead in the moist steaming underwoods, in the green\nswamps, in the sheltered valleys, in the ditches and furrows of the\nfields, amid the monuments of their own prowess, the ruined crops and the\ndishonoured vineyards. A poisonous element, issuing from their remains,\nmingled with the atmosphere, and corrupted it. The dismayed peasant found\nthat a pestilence had begun; a new visitation, not confined to the\nterritory which the enemy had made its own, but extending far and wide, as\nthe atmosphere extends, in all directions. Their daily toil, no longer\nclaimed by the produce of the earth, which has ceased to exist, is now\ndevoted to the object of ridding themselves of the deadly legacy which\nthey have received in its stead. In vain; it is their last toil; they are\ndigging pits, they are raising piles, for their own corpses, as well as\nfor the bodies of their enemies. Invader and victim lie in the same grave,\nburn in the same heap; they sicken while they work, and the pestilence\nspreads. A new invasion is menacing Sicca, in the shape of companies of\npeasants and slaves, (the panic having broken the bonds of discipline,)\nwith their employers and overseers, nay the farmers themselves and\nproprietors, rushing thither from famine and infection as to a place of\nsafety. The inhabitants of the city are as frightened as they, and more\nenergetic. They determine to keep them at a distance; the gates are\nclosed; a strict _cordon_ is drawn; however, by the continued pressure,\nnumbers contrive to make an entrance, as water into a vessel, or light\nthrough the closed shutters, and anyhow the air cannot be put into\nquarantine; so the pestilence has the better of it, and at last appears in\nthe alleys, and in the cellars of Sicca.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n                             WORSE AND WORSE.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO wretched minds of men! O blind hearts!\u00e2\u0080\u009d truly cries out a great heathen\npoet, but on grounds far other than the true ones. The true ground of such\na lamentation is, that men do not interpret the signs of the times and of\nthe world as He intends who has placed these signs in the heavens; that\nwhen Mane, Thecel, Phares, is written upon the ethereal wall, they have no\ninward faculty to read them withal; and that when they go elsewhere for\none learned in tongues, instead of taking Daniel, who is used to converse\nwith Angels, they rely on Magi or Chaldeans, who know only the languages\nof earth. So it was with the miserable population of Sicca now; half\nfamished, seized with a pestilence which was sure to rage before it\nassuaged, perplexed and oppressed by the recoil upon them of the\npopulation whom they had from time to time sent out into the surrounding\nterritory, or from whom they had supplied their markets, they never\nfancied that the real cause of the visitation which we have been\ndescribing was their own iniquity in their Maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sight, that His arm\ninflicted it, and that its natural and direct interpretation was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo\npenance, and be converted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the contrary, they looked only at their own\nvain idols, and at the vain rites which these idols demanded, and they\nthought there was no surer escape from their misery than by upholding a\nlie, and putting down all who revolted from it; and thus the visitation\nwhich was sent to do them good turned through their wilful blindness to\ntheir greater condemnation.\n\nThe Forum, which at all times was the resort of idleness and dissipation,\nnow became more and more the haunt of famine and sickness, of robust\nframes without work, of slavish natures virtually and for the time\nemancipated and uncontrolled, of youth and passion houseless and\nshelterless. In groups and companies, in and out of the porticoes, on the\nsteps of the temples, and about the booths and stalls of the market, a\nmultitude grows day by day, from the town and from the country, and of all\nthe various races which town and country contain. The civil magistracy and\nthe civil force to which the peace of the city was committed, were not\nequal to such an emergency as the present; and the _milites stationarii_,\na sort of garrison who represented the Roman power, though they were ready\nto act against either magistrates or mob impartially, had no tenderness\nfor either, when in collision with each other. Indeed the bonds of society\nwere broken, and every political element was at war with every other, in a\ncase of such great common calamity, when every one was angry with every\none else, for want of some clearly defined object against which the common\nanger might be discharged with unanimity.\n\nThey had almost given over sacrificing and consulting the flame or the\nentrails; for no reversal or respite of their sufferings had followed\ntheir most assiduous acts of deprecation. Moreover the omens were\ngenerally considered by the priests to have been unpropitious or adverse.\nA sheep had been discovered to have, instead of a liver, something very\nlike a gizzard; a sow had chewed and swallowed the flowers with which it\nhad been embellished for the sacrifice; and a calf, after receiving the\nfatal blow, instead of lying down and dying, dashed into the temple,\ndripping blood upon the pavement as it went, and at last fell and expired\njust before the sacred _adytum_. In despair the people took to\nfortune-telling and its attendant arts. Old crones were found in plenty\nwith their strange rites, the stranger the more welcome. Trenches were dug\nin by-places for sacrifices to the infernal gods; amulets, rings,\ncounters, tablets, pebbles, nails, bones, feathers, Ephesian or Egyptian\nlegends, were in request, and raised the hopes, or beguiled and occupied\nthe thoughts, of those who else would have been directly dwelling on their\nsufferings, present or in prospect.\n\nOthers were occupied, whether they would or no, with diversions fiercer\nand more earnest. There were continual altercations between farmers, small\nproprietors of land, government and city officials,\u00e2\u0080\u0094altercations so\nmanifold and violent, that, even were there no hubbub of voices, and no\nincoherence of wrath and fear to complicate them, we should despair of\nsetting them before the reader. An officer from the camp was expostulating\nwith one of the municipal authorities that no corn had been sent thither\nfor the last six or seven days, and the functionary attacked had thrown\nthe blame on the farmer, and he in turn had protested that he could not\nget cattle to bring the waggons into Sicca; those which he had set out\nwith had died of exhaustion on the journey. A clerk, as we now speak, in\nthe _Officium_ of the society of publicans or collectors of _annona_ was\nthreatening a number of small tenants with ejection for not sending in\ntheir rated portion of corn for the Roman people:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the _Officium_ of the\n_Notarius_, or assistant prefect, had written up to Sicca from Carthage in\nviolent terms; and come it must, though the locusts had eaten up every\nstack and granary. A number of half-starved peasants had been summoned for\npayment of their taxes, and in spite of their ignorance of Latin, they had\nbeen made to understand that death was the stern penalty of neglecting to\nbring the coin. They, on the other hand, by their fierce doggedness of\nmanner, seemed to signify by way of answer that death was not a penalty,\nunless life was a boon.\n\nThe _villicus_ of one of the decurions, who had an estate in the\nneighbourhood, was laying his miseries before the man of business of his\nemployer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are we to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalf the gang of slaves is dead,\nand the other half is so feeble, that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get through the work of the\nmonth. We ought to be sheep-shearing; you have no chance of wool. We ought\nto be swarming the bees, pressing the honey, boiling and purifying the\nwax. We ought to be plucking the white leaves of the camomile, and\nsteeping the golden flowers in oil. We ought to be gathering the wild\ngrapes, sifting off the flowers, and preserving the residue in honey. We\nought to be sowing brassicum, parsley, and coriander against next spring.\nWe ought to be cheese-making. We ought to be baking white and red bricks\nand tiles in the sun; we have no hands for the purpose. The _villicus_ is\nnot to blame, but the anger of the gods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The country _employ\u00c3\u00a9_ of the\nprocurator of the imperial _Baphia_ protests that the insect cannot be\nfound from which the dye is extracted; and argues that the locusts must\nhave devoured them, or the plant on which they feed, or that they have\nbeen carried off by the pestilence. Here is old Corbulus in agonies for\nhis febrifuge, and a slave of his is in high words with the\nmarket-carrier, who tells him that Mago, who supplied it, is dead of a\nworse fever than his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rogue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the slave, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy master\nhas contracted with him for the year, and has paid him the money in\nadvance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A jeering and mocking from the crowd assailed the unfortunate\ndomestic, who so truly foreboded that his return without the medicine\nwould be the signal for his summary committal to the _pistrinum_. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet old\nCorbulus follow Mago in his passage to perdition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the rabble;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clet him take his physic with Pluto, and leave us the bread and wine on\nwhich he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grown gouty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBread, bread!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the response elicited by this\ndenunciation, and it spread into a circle larger than that of which the\nslave and the carrier were part.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWine and bread, Ceres and Liber!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried a young legionary, who, after a\nnight of revelry, was emerging still half-intoxicated from one of the low\nwine-shops in the vaults which formed the basement of the _Therm\u00c3\u00a6_ or hot\nbaths; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake way there, you filthy slime of the earth, you half-kneaded,\nhalf-fermented Africans, who never yet have quite been men, but have ever\nsmelt strong of the baboon, who are three quarters _must_, and two\nvinegar, and a fifth water,\u00e2\u0080\u0094as I was saying, you are like bad liquor, and\nthe sight of you disagrees with the stomach and affects the eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe crowd looked sullenly, and without wincing, at his shield, which was\nthe only portion of his military accoutrements which he had preserved\nafter his carouse. The white surface, with a silver boss in the centre,\nsurrounded by first a white and then a red circle, and the purple border,\nshowed that he belonged to the Tertiani or third Italic Legion, which had\nbeen stationed in Africa since the time of Augustus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVile double-tongued\nmongrels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat are you fit for but to gather the fruits of\nthe earth for your owners and lords, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Romanos dominos rerum\u00e2\u0080\u0099? And if there\nare now no fruits to reap, why your service is gone. Go home and die, and\ndrown yourselves, for what are you fit for now, except to take your dead\ncorpses away from the nostrils of a Roman, the cream of humankind? Ye\nbase-born apes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you catch the pestilence, because our blood\nmantles and foams in our ruddy veins like new milk in the wine cup, which\nis too strong for this clime, and my blood is up, and I drink a full\nmeasure of it to great Rome; for what does old Horace say, but \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nunc est\nbibendum\u00e2\u0080\u0099? and so get out of my way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo a good part of the multitude, both peasantry and town rabble, Latin was\nunintelligible; but they all understood vocabulary and syntax and logic,\nas soon as he drew his knuckles across one fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face who refused to\nmove from his path, and as soon as his insult was returned by the latter\nwith a thrust of the dagger. A rush was made upon him, on which he made a\nface at them, shook his fist, and leaping on one side, ran with great\nswiftness to an open space in advance. From his quarrelsome humour rather\nthan from fear, he raised a cry of alarm; on which two or three\nfellow-soldiers made their appearance from similar dens of intoxication\nand vice, and came up to the rescue. The mob assailed them with stones,\nand the cream of human nature was likely to be roughly churned, when,\nseeing matters were becoming serious, they suddenly took to their heels,\nand got into the Temple of Esculapius on one side of the Forum. The mob\nfollowed, the ministers of the sacred place attempted to shut the gates, a\nscuffle ensued, and a riot was in progress. Self-preservation is the first\nlaw of man; trembling for the safety of his noble buildings, and\nconsidering that it was a bread riot, as it really was, the priest of the\ngod came forward, rebuked the mob for its impiety, and showed the\nabsurdity of supposing that there were loaves in his enclosure to satisfy\nits wants; but he reminded them that there was a baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop at the other\nend of the Forum, which was one of the most considerable in Sicca.\n\nA slight impulse determines the movements of an excited multitude. Off\nthey went to the quarter in question, where certainly there was the very\nlarge and handsome store of a substantial dealer in grain of all sorts,\nand in other produce. The shop, however, seemed on this occasion to be but\npoorly furnished; for the baker was a prudent man, and feared a display of\nprovisions which would be an invitation to a hungry multitude. The\nassailants, however, were not to be baffled; some one cried out that the\nman had withdrawn his corn from the market for his own ends, and that\ngreat stores were accumulated within. They avail themselves of the hint;\nthey pour in through the open front, the baker escapes as he may, his\nmills and ovens are smashed, the house is ransacked; whatever is found is\nseized, thrown about, wasted, eaten, as the case may be; and the mob gains\nstrength and appetite for fresh exploits.\n\nHowever, the rioters have no definite plan of action yet. Some of them\nhave penetrated into the stable behind the house in search of corn. They\nfind the mill-ass which ground for the baker, and bring it out. It is a\nbeast of more than ordinary pretensions, such as you would not often see\nin a mill, showing both the wealth of the owner and the flourishing\ncondition of his trade. The asses of Africa are finer than those in the\nnorth; but this is fine for an African. One fellow mounts upon it, and\nsets off with the world before him, like a knight-errant, seeking an\nadventure, the rabble at his tail acting as squire. He begins the circuit\nof the Forum, and picks up its riff-raff as he goes along\u00e2\u0080\u0094here some rascal\nboys, there some drunken women, here again a number of half-brutalized\ncountry slaves and peasants. Partly out of curiosity, partly from\nidleness, from ill temper, from hope of spoil, from a vague desire to be\ndoing something or other, every one who has nothing to lose by the\nadventure crowds around and behind him. And on the contrary, as he\nadvances, and the noise and commotion increase, every one who has a\nposition of any sort, the confidential _vern\u00c3\u00a6_ of great families, farmers,\nshopkeepers, men of business, officials, vanish from the scene of action\nwithout delay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfrica, Africa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d is now the cry; the signal in that country, as an\nancient writer tells us, that the parties raising it have something new in\nhand, and have a mind to do it.\n\nSuddenly, as they march on, a low and awful growl is heard. It comes from\nthe booth of a servant of the imperial court. He is employed as a\ntransporter of wild beasts from the interior to the coast, where they are\nshipped for Rome; and he has charge at present of a noble lion, who is\nsitting majestically, looking through the bars of his cage at the rabble,\nwho now begin to look at him. In demeanour and in mental endowments he has\nthe advantage of them. It was at this moment, while they were closing,\nhustling each other, staring at the beast, and hoping to provoke him, that\na shrill voice cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristianos ad leones, Christianos ad leones!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthe Christians to the lions! A sudden and dead silence ensued, as if the\nwords had struck the breath out of the promiscuous throng. An interval\npassed; and then the same voice was heard again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristianos ad leones!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis time the whole Forum took it up from one end to the other. The fate\nof the day, the direction of the movement, was decided; a distinct object\nwas obtained, and the only wonder was that the multitude had been so long\nto seek and so slow to find so obvious a cause of their misfortunes, so\nadequate a subject of their vengeance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristianos ad leones!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was\nshouted out by town and country, priests and people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong live the\nemperor! long live Decius! he told us this long ago. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the edict; it\nnever has been obeyed. Death to the magistrates! To the Christians! to the\nChristians! Up with great Jove, down with the atheists!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were commencing their march when the ass caught their eye. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nChristians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 god!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they shouted out; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe god of the Christians!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their\nfirst impulse was to give the poor beast to the lion, their next to\nsacrifice it, but they did not know to whom. Then they said they would\nmake the Christians worship it; and dressing it up in tawdry finery, they\nretained it at the head of their procession.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n                          CHRISTIANOS AD LEONES.\n\n\nBy the time that they had got round again to the unlucky baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the mob\nhad been swollen to a size which even the area of the Forum would not\ncontain, and it filled the adjacent streets. And by the same time it had\ncome home to its leaders, and, indeed, to every one who used his reason at\nall, that it was very far from certain that there were any Christians in\nSicca, and if so, still very far from easy to say where they were. And the\ndifficulty was of so practical a character as to keep them inactive for\nthe space of several hours. Meanwhile their passions were excited to the\nboiling point by the very presence of the difficulty, as men go mad of\nthirst when water is denied them. At length, after a long season of such\nviolent commotion, such restless pain, such curses, shrieks, and\nblasphemies, such bootless gesticulations, such aimless contests with each\nother, that they seemed to be already inmates of the prison beneath, they\nset off in a blind way to make the circuit of the city as before they had\nparaded round the Forum, still in the knight-errant line, looking out for\nwhat might turn up where they were sure of nothing, and relieving the\nintense irritation of their passions by locomotion, if nothing more\nsubstantial was offered to them.\n\nIt was an awful day for the respectable inhabitants of the place; worse\nthan anything that even the most timid of them had anticipated, when they\nhad showed their jealousy of a popular movement against the proscribed\nreligion; for the stimulus of famine and pestilence was added to hatred of\nChristianity, in that unreasoning multitude. The magistrates shut\nthemselves up in dismay; the small body of Roman soldiery reserved their\nstrength for the defence of themselves; and the poor wretches, not a few,\nwho had fallen from the faith, and offered sacrifice, hung out from their\ndoors sinful heathen symbols, to avert a storm against which apostasy was\nno sufficient safeguard. In this conduct the Gnostics and other sectaries\nimitated them, while the Tertullianists took a more manly part, from\nprinciple or pride.\n\nIt would require the brazen voice which Homer speaks of, or the magic pen\nof Sir Walter, to catalogue and to picture, as far as it is lawful to do\neither, the figures and groups of that most miserable procession. As it\nwent forward it gained a variety and strength, which the circuit of the\nForum could not furnish. The more respectable religious establishments\nshut their gates, and would have nothing to do with it. The priests of\nJupiter, the educational establishments of the Temple of Mercury, the\nTemple of the Genius of Rome near the Capitol, the hierophants of Isis,\nthe Minerva, the Juno, the Esculapius, viewed the popular rising with\nterror and disgust; but these were not the popular worships. The vast\nhomestead of Astarte, which in the number and vowed profligacy of its\ninhabitants rivalled the vaults upon the Forum; the old rites, many and\ndiversified, if separately obscure, which came from Punic times; the new\nimportations from Syria and Phrygia, and a number of other haunts and\nschools of depravity and crime, did their part in swelling or giving\ncharacter to the concourse. The hungry and idle rabble, the filthy beggars\nwho fed on the offal of the sacrifices, the drivers and slaughterers of\nthe beasts sacrificed; the tumblers and mountebanks who amused the gaping\nmarket-people; dancers, singers, pipers from low taverns and\ndrinking-houses; infamous creatures, young and old, men and boys, half\nnaked and not half sober; brutal blacks, the aboriginal race of the Atlas,\nwith their appetites written on their skulls and features; Canaanites, as\nthey called themselves, from the coast; the wild beast-keepers from the\namphitheatre; troops of labourers from the fields, to whom the epidemic\nwas a time of Saturnalia; and the degraded company, alas! how numerous and\nhow pitiable, who took their nightly stand in long succession at the doors\nof their several cells in the deep galleries under the Therm\u00c3\u00a6; all these,\nand many others, had their part and place in the procession. There you\nmight see the devilish emblems of idolatry borne aloft by wretches from\nthe great Punic Temple, while frantic forms, ragged and famished, wasted\nand shameless, leapt and pranced around them. There too was a choir of\nBacchanals, ready at a moment with songs as noisy as they were\nunutterable. And there was the priest of the Punic Saturn, the\nchild-devourer, a sort of Moloch, to whom the martyrdom of Christians was\na sacred rite; he and all his attendants in fiery-coloured garments, as\nbecame a sanguinary religion. And there, moreover, was a band of fanatics,\ndevotees of Cybele or of the Syrian goddess, if indeed the two rites were\ndistinct. They were bedizened with ribbons and rags of various colours,\nand smeared over with paint. They had long hair like women, and turbans on\ntheir heads. They pushed their way to the head of the procession, being\nquite worthy of the post of honour, and, seizing the baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass, put\ntheir goddess on the back of it. Some of them were playing the fife,\nothers clashing cymbals, others danced, others yelled, others rolled their\nheads, and others flogged themselves. Such was the character of the\nfrenzied host, which progressed slowly through the streets, while every\nnow and then, when there was an interval in the hubbub, the words\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChristianos ad leones\u00e2\u0080\u009d were thundered out by some ruffian voice, and a\nthousand others fiercely responded.\n\nStill no Christian was forthcoming; and it was plain that the rage of the\nmultitude must be discharged in other quarters, if the difficulty\ncontinued in satisfying it. At length some one recollected the site of the\nChristian chapel, when it existed; thither went the multitude, and\neffected an entrance without delay. It had long been turned to other\npurposes, and was now a store of casks and leather bottles. The miserable\nsacristan had long given up any practical observance of his faith, and\nremained on the spot a keeper of the premises for the trader who owned\nthem. They found him, and dragged him into the street, and brought him\nforward to the ass, and to the idol on its back, and bade him worship the\none and the other. The poor wretch obeyed; he worshipped the ass, he\nworshipped the idol, and he worshipped the genius of the emperor; but his\npersecutors wanted blood; they would not submit to be cheated of their\ndraught; so when they had made him do whatever they exacted, they flung\nhim under the feet of the multitude, who, as they passed on, soon trod all\nlife and breath out of him, and sent him to the powers below, to whom he\nhad just before been making his profession.\n\nTheir next adventure was with a Tertullianist, who stationed himself at\nhis shop-door, displayed the sign of the cross, and walking leisurely\nforward, seized the idol on the ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, broke it over his knee, and\nflung the portions into the crowd. For a few minutes they stared on him\nwith astonishment, then some women fell upon him with their nails and\nteeth, and tore the poor fanatic till he fell bleeding and lifeless upon\nthe ground.\n\nIn the higher and better part of the city, which they now approached,\nlived the widow of a Duumvir, who in his day had made a bold profession of\nChristianity. The well connected lady was a Christian also, and was\nsheltered by her great friends from the persecution. She was bringing up a\nfamily in great privacy, and with straitened means, and with as much\nreligious strictness as was possible under the circumstances of the place.\nShe kept them from all bad sights and bad company, was careful as to the\ncharacter of the slaves she placed about them, and taught them all she\nknew of her religion, which was quite sufficient for their salvation. They\nhad all been baptized, some by herself in default of the proper minister,\nand, as far as they could show at their tender ages, which lay between\nthirteen and seven, the three girls and the two boys were advancing in the\nlove of truth and sanctity. Her husband, some years back, when presiding\nin the Forum, had punished with just severity an act of ungrateful fraud;\nand the perpetrator had always cherished a malignant hatred of him and\nhis. The moment of gratifying it had now arrived, and he pointed out to\nthe infuriated rabble the secluded mansion where the Christian household\ndwelt. He could not offer to them a more acceptable service, and the\nlady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s modest apartment was soon swarming with enemies of her God and His\nfollowers. In spite of her heartrending cries and supplications, her\nchildren were seized, and when the youngest boy clung to her, the mother\nwas thrown senseless upon the pavement. The whole five were carried off in\ntriumph; it was the greatest success of the day. There was some hesitation\nhow to dispose of them; at last the girls were handed over to the\npriestesses of Astarte, and the boys to the loathsome votaries of Cybele.\n\nRevenge upon Christians was the motive principle of the riot; but the\nprospect of plunder stimulated numbers, and here Christians could not\nminister to their desires. They began the day by the attack upon the\nprovision-shop, and now they had reached the aristocratic quarter of the\ncity, and they gazed with envy and cupidity at the noble mansions which\noccupied it. They began to shout out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBread, bread!\u00e2\u0080\u009d while they uttered\nthreats against the Christians; they violently beat at the closed gates,\nand looked about for means of scaling the high walls which defended them\nin front. The cravings of famished men soon take form and organization;\nthey began to ask relief from house to house. Nothing came amiss; and\nloaves, figs, grapes, wine, found their way into the hands and mouths of\nthose who were the least exhausted and the least enfeebled. A second line\nof fierce supplicants succeeded to the first; and it was plain that,\nunless some diversion were effected, the respectable quarter of Sicca had\nfound a worse enemy than the locust.\n\nThe houses of the government _susceptor_, or tax collector, of the\n_tabularius_ or registrar, of the _defensor_ or city counsel, and one or\ntwo others, had already been the scene of collisions between the domestic\nslaves and the multitude, when a demand was made upon the household of\nanother of the Curia, who held the office of Flamen Dialis. He was a\nwealthy, easy-going man, generally popular, with no appetite for\npersecution at all, but still no desire to be persecuted. He had more than\ntolerated the Christians, and had at this time a Christian among his\nslaves. This was a Greek, a splendid cook and perfumer, and he would not\nhave lost him for a large sum of money. However, life and limb were nearer\nto him even than his dinner, and a Jonah must be cast overboard to save\nthe ship. In trepidation, yet with greater satisfaction, his\nfellow-domestics thrust the poor helpless man out of the house, and\nsecured the door behind him. He was a man of middle age, of a grave\naspect, and he looked silently and calmly upon the infuriated and yelling\nmultitude, who were swarming up the hill about him, and swelling the\nnumber of his persecutors. What had been his prospects, had he remained in\nhis earthly master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service? his fill of meat and drink while he was\nstrong and skilful, the stocks or scourge if he ever failed to please him,\nand the old age and death of the worn-out hack who once has caracoled in\nthe procession, or snorted at the coming fight. What are his prospects\nnow? a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agony, a martyr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, and the everlasting beatific\nvision of Him for whom he died. The multitude cry out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the ass or to\nthe lion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d worship the ass, or fight the lion. He was dragged to the ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhead and commanded to kneel down before the irrational beast. In the\ncourse of a minute he had lifted up his eyes to heaven, had signed himself\nwith the cross, had confessed his Saviour, and had been torn to pieces by\nthe multitude. They anticipated the lion of the amphitheatre.\n\nA lull followed, sure to be succeeded by a fresh storm. Not every\nhousehold had a Christian cook to make a victim of. Plunder, riot, and\noutrage were becoming the order of the day; successive messengers were\nsent up in breathless haste to the capitol and the camp for aid, but the\nRomans returned for answer that they had enough to do in defending the\ngovernment buildings and offices. They suggested measures, however, for\nputting the mob on a false scent, or involving them in some difficult or\ntedious enterprise, which would give the authorities time for\ndeliberation, and for taking the rioters at disadvantage. If the\nmagistrates could get them out of the city, it would be a great point;\nthey could then shut the gates upon them, and deal with them as they\nwould. In that case, too, the insurgents would straggle, and divide, and\nthen they might be disposed of in detail. They were showing symptoms of\nreturning fury, when a voice suddenly cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius the Christian!\nAgellius the sorcerer! Agellius to the lions! To the farm of Varius\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the\ncottage of Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the south-west gate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d A sudden yell burst forth\nfrom the vast multitude when the voice ceased. The impulse had been given\nas at the first; the tide of human beings ebbed and retreated, and,\nlicking the base of the hill, rushed vehemently on one side, and roared\nlike a torrent towards the south-west. Juba, thy prophecy is soon to be\nfulfilled! The locusts will bring more harm on thy brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home than\nimperial edict or local magistrate. The decline of day will hardly prevent\nthe visitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n                             AGELLIUS FLITS.\n\n\nA change had passed over the fair face of Nature, as seen from the cottage\nof Agellius, since that evening on which our story opened; and it is so\npainful to contemplate waste, decay, and disappointment, that we mean to\nsay little about it. There was the same cloudless sky as then; and the sun\ntravelled in its silent and certain course, with even a more intense\ndesire than then to ripen grain and fruit for the use of man; but its\noccupation was gone, for fruit and grain were not, nor man to collect and\nto enjoy them. A dark broad shadow passed across the beautiful prospect\nand disfigured it. When you looked more closely, it was as if a fire had\nburned up the whole surface included under that shadow, and had stripped\nthe earth of its clothing. Nothing had escaped; not a head of khennah, not\na rose or carnation, not an orange or an orange blossom, not a _boccone_,\nnot a cluster of unripe grapes, not a berry of the olive, not a blade of\ngrass. Gardens, meadows, vineyards, orchards, copses, instead of rejoicing\nin the rich variety of hue which lately was their characteristic, were now\nreduced to one dreary cinder-colour. The smoke of fires was actually\nrising from many points, where the spoilt and poisonous vegetation was\nburning in heaps, or the countless corpses of the invading foe, or of the\ncattle, or of the human beings whom the pestilence had carried off. The\nmost furious inroad of savage hordes, of Vandals, or of Saracens, who were\ndestined at successive eras to come and waste that country, could not have\nspread such thorough desolation. The slaves of the farm of Varius were\nsorrowfully turning to a new employment, that of clearing away the wreck\nand disappointment of the bright spring from flower-bed, vineyard, and\nfield.\n\nIt was on the forenoon of the eventful day whose course we have been\ntracing in the preceding Chapters, that a sharp-looking boy presented\nhimself to Agellius, who was directing his labourers in their work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\ncome from Jucundus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009che has instant need of you. You are to go\nwith me, and by my way; and this is the proof I tell you truth. He sends\nyou this note, and wishes you in a bad time the best gifts of Bacchus and\nCeres.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius took the tablets, and went with them across the road to the place\nwhere C\u00c3\u00a6cilius was at work, in appearance a slave. The letter ran\nthus:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cJucundus to Agellius. I trust you are well enough to move; you are\nnot safe for many days in your cottage; there is a rising this morning\nagainst the Christians, and you may be visited. Unless you are ambitious\nof Styx and Tartarus, follow the boy without questioning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Agellius showed\nthe letter to the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are no longer safe here, my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhither shall we go?\nLet us go together. Can you take me to Carthage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCarthage is quite as dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Sicca is more\ncentral. We can but leap into the sea at Carthage; here there are many\nlines to retreat upon. I am known there, I am not known here. Here, too, I\nhear all that goes on through the proconsulate and Numidia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what can we do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere we cannot remain, and you at\nleast cannot venture into the city. Somewhither we must go, and where is\nthat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe priest thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must separate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The tears came into\nAgellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I am a stranger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know more of the\nneighbourhood of Sicca than you who are a native. There is a famous\nChristian retreat on the north of the city, and by this time, I doubt not,\nor rather I know, it is full of refugees. The fury of the enemy is\nextending on all hands, and our brethren, from as far as Cirtha round to\nCurubis, are falling back upon it. The only difficulty is how to get round\nto it without going through Sicca.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius.\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius showed signs of perplexity, and his mind retired into itself. He\nseemed for the moment to be simply absent from the scene about him, but\nsoon his intelligence returned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must separate,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the\ntime; it will not be for long. That is, I suppose, your uncle will take\ngood care of you, and he has influence. We are safest just now when most\nindependent of each other. It is only for a while. We shall meet again\nsoon; I tell you so. Did we keep together just now, it would be the worse\nfor each of us. You go with the boy; I will go off to the place I\nmentioned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow will you get there? What shall I\nsuffer from my fears about you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmind, I tell you so. It will be a trying\ntime, but my hour is not yet come. I am good for years yet; so are you,\nfor many more than mine. He will protect and rescue me, though I know not\nhow. Go, leave me to myself, Agellius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO my father, my only stay upon earth, whom God sent me in my extreme\nneed, to whom I owe myself, must I then quit you; must a layman desert a\npriest; the young the old?... Ah! it is I really, not you, who am without\nprotection. Angels surround you, father; but I am a poor wanderer. Give me\nyour blessing that evil may not touch me. I go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not kneel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey will see you. Stop, I have got to\ntell you how and where to find me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then proceeded to give him the\nnecessary instructions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWalk out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009calong the road to\nThibursicumbur to the third milestone, you will come to a country road;\npursue it; walk a thousand steps; then again for the space of seven\n_paternosters_; and then speak to the man upon your right hand. And now\naway with you, God speed you, we shall not long be parted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he made\nthe sign of the cross over him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat old chap gives himself airs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, when Agellius joined\nhim; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat may he be? one of your slaves, Agellius?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a pert boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor asking me the question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say the Christians brought the locusts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Firmian, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby their\nenchantments; and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a jolly row beginning in the Forum just now. The\nreport goes that you are a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because your people have nothing better to do than talk against\ntheir neighbours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause you are so soft, rather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother man would have\nknocked me down for saying it; but you are lackadaisical folk, who bear\ninsults tamely. Arnobius says your father was a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather and son are not always the same religion now-a-days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nAgellius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Firmian, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the Christians came from Egypt: and as\ncook there is the son of cook, and soldier is son of soldier, so\nChristian, take my word for it, is the son of a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChristians boast, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat they are of no one\nrace or country, but are members of a large unpatriotic family, whose home\nis in the sky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChristians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould never have framed the great Roman\nempire; that was the work of heroes. Great C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Marius, Marcus Brutus,\nCamillus, Cicero, Sylla, Lucullus, Scipio, could never have been\nChristians. Arnobius says they are a skulking set of fellows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you wish to be a hero,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am to be a pleader,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Firmian; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to be a great\norator like Cicero, and every one listening to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were walking along the top of a mud wall, which separated Varius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfarm from his neighbour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, when suddenly Firmian, who led the way, leapt\ndown into a copse, which reached as far as the ravine in which the knoll\nterminated towards Sicca. The boy still went forward by devious paths,\ntill they had mounted as high as the city wall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are bringing me where there is no entrance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius.\n\nThe boy laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJucundus told me to bring you by a blind way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know best why. This is one of our ways in and out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was an aperture in the wall, and the bricks and stones about it were\nloose, and admitted of removal. It was such a private way of passage as\nschoolboys know of. On getting through, Agellius found himself in a\nneglected garden or small close. Everything was silent about them, as if\nthe inhabitants were away; there was a great noise in the distance, as if\nsomething unusual were going on in the heart of the town. The boy told him\nto follow him as fast as he could without exciting remark; and, leading\nhim by lanes and alleys unknown to Agellius, at last brought him close\nupon the scene of riot. At this time the expedition in search of\nChristians had just commenced; to cross the Forum was to shorten his\njourney, and perhaps was safer than to risk meeting the mob in the\nstreets. Firmian took the step; and while their attention was directed\nelsewhere, brought Agellius safely through it. They then proceeded\ncautiously as before, till they stood before the back door of the house of\nJucundus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay a good word for me to your uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have done my job.\nHe must remember me handsomely at the Augustalia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he ran away.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile C\u00c3\u00a6cilius had been anxiously considering the course which it was\nsafest for him to pursue. He must move, but he must wait till dusk, when\nthe ways were clear, and the light uncertain. Till then he must keep close\nin-doors. There was a remarkable cavern in the mountains above Sicca,\nwhich had been used as a place of refuge for Christians from the very time\nthey had first suffered persecution in Roman Africa. No spot in its whole\nterritory seemed more fit for what is called a base of operations, from\nwhich the soldiers of the Cross might advance, or to which they might\nretire, according as the fury of their enemy grew or diminished. While it\nwas in the midst of a wilderness difficult of access, and feared as the\nresort of ghosts and evil influences, it was not far from a city near to\nwhich the high roads met from Hippo and from Carthage. A branch of the\nBagradas, navigable for boats, opened a way from it through the woods,\nwhere flight and concealment were easy on a surprise, as far as Madaura,\nVacca, and other places; at the same time it commanded the vast plain on\nthe south which extended to the roots of the Atlas. Just now, the\npersecution growing, many deacons, other ecclesiastics, and prominent\nlaymen from all parts of the country had fallen back upon this cavern or\ngrotto; and in no place could C\u00c3\u00a6cilius have better means than here of\nlearning the general state of affairs, and of communicating with countries\nbeyond the seas. He was indeed on his way thither, when the illness of\nAgellius made it a duty for him to stop and restore him, and attend to his\nspiritual needs; and he had received an inward intimation, on which he\nimplicitly relied, to do so.\n\nThe problem at this moment was how to reach the refuge in question. His\ndirect road lay through Sicca; this being impracticable at present, he had\nto descend into the ravine which lay between him and the city, and,\nturning to the left, to traverse the broad plain, the Campus Martius of\nSicca, into which it opened. Here the mountain would rise abruptly on his\nright with those steep cliffs which we have already described as rounding\nthe north side of Sicca. He must traverse many miles before he could reach\nthe point at which the rock lost its precipitous character, and changed\ninto a declivity allowing the traveller to ascend. It was a bold\nundertaking; for all this he had to accomplish in the dark before the\nmorning broke, a stranger too to the locality, and directing his movements\nonly by the information of others, which, however accurate and distinct,\ncould scarcely be followed, even if without risk of error, at least\nwithout misgiving. However, could he master this point before the morning\nhe was comparatively safe; he then had to strike into the solitary\nmountains, and to retrace his steps for a while towards Sicca along the\nroad, till he came to a place where he knew that Christian scouts or\n_videttes_ (as they may be called) were always stationed.\n\nThis being his plan, and there being no way of mending it, our confessor\nretired into the cottage, and devoted the intervening hours to intercourse\nwith that world from which his succour must come. He set himself to\nintercede for the Holy Catholic Church throughout the world, now for the\nmost part under persecution, and for the Roman Empire, not yet holy, which\nwas the instrument of the evil powers against her. He had to pray for the\nproconsulate, for Numidia, Mauretania, and the whole of Africa; for the\nChristian communities throughout it, for the cessation of the trial then\npresent, and for the fortitude and perseverance of all who were tried. He\nhad to pray for his own personal friends, his penitents, converts,\nenemies; for children, catechumens, neophytes; for those who were\napproaching the Church, for those who had fallen away, or were falling\naway from her; for all heretics, for all troublers of unity, that they\nmight be reclaimed. He had to confess, bewail and deprecate the many sins\nand offences which he knew of, foreboded, or saw in prospect as to come.\nScarcely had he entered on his charge at Carthage four years before, when\nhe had had to denounce one portentous scandal in which a sacred order of\nthe ministry was implicated. What internal laxity did not that scandal\nimply! And then again what a low standard of religion, what niggardly\nfaith, and what worn-out, used-up sanctity in the community at large, was\nrevealed in the fact of those frequent apostasies of individuals which\nthen were occurring! He prayed fervently that both from the bright pattern\nof martyrs, and from the warning afforded by the lapsed, the Christian\nbody might be edified and invigorated. He saw with great anxiety two\nschisms in prospect, when the persecution should come to an end, one from\nthe perverseness of those who were too rigid, the other from those who\nwere too indulgent towards the fallen; and in proportion to his gift of\nprescience was the earnestness of his intercession that the wounds of the\nChurch might be healed with the least possible delay. He then turned to\nthe thought of his own correspondence then in progress with the Holy Roman\nChurch, which had lately lost its bishop by martyrdom. This indeed was no\nunusual event with the see of Peter, in which the successors of Peter\nfollowed Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steps, as Peter had been bidden to follow the King and\nExemplar of Martyrs. But the special trouble was, that months had passed,\nfull five, since the vacancy occurred, and it had not yet been supplied.\nThen he thought of Fabian, who made the vacancy, and who had already\npassed through that trial which was to bring to so many Christians life or\ncondemnation, and he commended himself to his prayers against the hour of\nhis own combat. He thought of Fabian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, and went on to intercede for\nthe remnant of the seven apostles whom that Pope had sent into Gaul, and\nsome of whom had already obtained the martyr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crown. He prayed that the\nday might come, when not the cities only of that fair country, but its\nrich champaigns and sunny slopes should hear the voice of the missionary.\nHe prayed in like manner for Britain, that the successful work of another\nPope, St. Eleutherius, might be extended even to its four seas. And then\nhe prayed for the neighbouring island on the west, still in heathen\ndarkness, and for the endless expanse of Germany on the east, that there\ntoo the one saving name and glorious Faith might be known and accepted.\n\nHis thoughts then travelled back to Rome and Italy, and to the martyrdoms\nwhich had followed that of St. Fabian. Two Persians had already suffered\nin the imperial city; Maximus had lost his life, and Felix had been\nimprisoned, at Nola. Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt had already afforded\nvictims to the persecution, and cried aloud to all Christians for their\nmost earnest prayers and for repeated Masses in behalf of those who\nremained under the trial. Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, the third see in\nChristendom, was already martyred in that city. Here again C\u00c3\u00a6cilius had a\nstrong call on him for intercession, for a subtle form of freethinking was\nthere manifesting itself, the issue of which was as uncertain as it might\nbe frightful. The Bishop of Alexandria, that second of the large divisions\nor patriarchates of the Church, the great Dionysius, the pupil of Origen,\nwas an exile from his see, like himself. The messenger who brought this\nnews to Carthage had heard at Alexandria a report from Neoc\u00c3\u00a6sarea, that\nGregory, another pupil of Origen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the Apostle of Pontus, had also been\nobliged to conceal himself from the persecution. As for Origen himself,\nthe aged, laborious, gifted, zealous teacher of his time, he was just then\nengaged in answering the works of an Epicurean called Celsus, and on him\ntoo the persecution was likely to fall; and C\u00c3\u00a6cilius prayed earnestly that\nso great a soul might be kept from such high untrue speculations as were\nthreatening evil at Antioch, and from every deceit and snare which might\nendanger his inheriting that bright crown which ought to be his portion in\nheaven. Another remarkable report had come, viz., that some young men of\nEgypt had retired to the deserts up the country under the stress of the\npersecution,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Paul was the name of one of them,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that they were there\nliving in the practice of mortification and prayer so singular, and had\ncombats with the powers of darkness and visitations from above so special,\nas to open quite a new era in the spiritual history of the Church.\n\nAnd then his thoughts came back to his poor Agellius, and all those\nhundred private matters of anxiety which the foes of the Church, occupied\nonly with her external aspect, little suspected. For Agellius, he prayed,\nand for his; for the strange wayward Juba, for Jucundus, for Callista; ah!\nthat Callista might be brought on to that glorious consummation, for which\nshe seemed marked out! But the ways of the Most High are not as our ways,\nand those who to us seem nearest are often furthest from Him; and so our\nholy priest left the whole matter in the hands of Him to whom he prayed,\nsatisfied that he had done his part in praying.\n\nThis was the course of thought which occupied him for many hours, after\n(as we have said) he had closed the door upon him, and knelt down before\nthe cross. Not merely before the symbol of redemption did he kneel; for he\nopened his tunic at the neck, and drew thence a small golden pyx which was\nthere suspended. In that carefully fastened case he possessed the Holiest,\nhis Lord and his God. That Everlasting Presence was his stay and guide\namid his weary wanderings, his joy and consolation amid his overpowering\nanxieties. Behold the secret of his sweet serenity, and his clear\nunclouded determination. He had placed it upon the small table at which he\nknelt, and was soon absorbed in meditation and intercession.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XIX.\n\n\n                            A PASSAGE OF ARMS.\n\n\nHow many hours passed while C\u00c3\u00a6cilius was thus employed, he did not know.\nThe sun was declining when he was roused by a noise at the door. He\nhastily restored the sacred treasure to its hiding-place in his breast,\nand rose up from his knees. The door was thrown back, and a female form\npresented itself at the opening. She looked in at the priest, and said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen Agellius is not here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe woman was young, tall, and graceful in person. She was clad in a\nyellow cotton tunic, reaching to her feet, on which were shoes. The clasps\nat her shoulders, partly visible under the short cloak or shawl which was\nthrown over them, and which might, if necessary, be drawn over her head,\nseemed to serve the purpose, not only of fastening her dress, but of\nproviding her with sharp prongs or minute stilettos for her defence, in\ncase she fell in with ruffians by the way; and though the expression of\nher face was most feminine, there was that about it which implied she\ncould use them for that purpose on an emergency. That face was clear in\ncomplexion, regular in outline, and at the present time pale, whatever\nmight be its ordinary tint. Its charm was a noble and majestic calm. There\nis the calm of divine peace and joy; there is the calm of heartlessness;\nthere is the calm of reckless desperation; there is the calm of death.\nNone of these was the calm which breathed from the features of the\nstranger who intruded upon the solitude of C\u00c3\u00a6cilius. It was the calm of\nGreek sculpture; it imaged a soul nourished upon the visions of genius,\nand subdued and attuned by the power of a strong will. There was no\nappearance of timidity in her manner; very little of modesty. The evening\nsun gleamed across her amber robe, and lit it up till it glowed like fire,\nas if she were invested in the marriage _flammeum_, and was to be claimed\nthat evening as the bride of her own bright god of day.\n\nShe looked at C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, first with surprise, then with anxiety; and her\nwords were, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, I fear, are of his people. If so, make the most of these\nhours. The foe may be on you to-morrow morning. Fly while you can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I am a Christian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat are you who are so careful\nof us? Have you come all the way from Sicca to give the alarm to mere\natheists and magic-mongers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStranger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you had seen what I have seen, what I have heard\nof to-day, you would not wonder at my wish to save from a like fate the\nvilest being on earth. A hideous mob is rioting in the city, thirsting for\nthe blood of Christians; an accident may turn it in the direction of\nAgellius. He is gone; where is he? Murderous outrages have already been\nperpetrated; you remain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe who is so tender of Christians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust herself\nhave some sparks of the Christian flame in her own breast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista sat down half unconsciously upon the bench or stool near the\ndoor; but she at once suddenly started up again, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAway, fly!\nperhaps they are coming; where is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius has been conveyed away to a safe\nhiding-place; for me, I shall be taken care of; there is no need for\nhurry; sit down again. But you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must not be found\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey know _me_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am well known here. I work for the temples.\nI have nothing to fear. I am no Christian;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, as if from an\ninexplicable overruling influence, she sat down again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a Christian yet, you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA person must be born a Christian, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin order to take\nup the religion. It is a very beautiful idea, as far as I have heard\nanything about it; but one must suck it in with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf so, it never could have come into the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest.\n\nShe paused for a while. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered at length; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut a new\nreligion begins by appealing to what is peculiar in the minds of a few.\nThe doctrine, floating on the winds, finds its own; it takes possession of\ntheir minds; they answer its call; they are brought together by that\ncommon influence; they are strong in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sympathy; they create\nand throw around them an external form, and thus they found a religion.\nThe sons are brought up in their fathers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 faith; and what was the idea of\na few becomes at length the profession of a race. Such is Judaism; such\nthe religion of Zoroaster, or of the Egyptians.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will find,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the greater number of African\nChristians at this moment, for of them I speak confidently, are converts\nin manhood, not the sons of Christians. On the other hand, if there be\nthose who have left the faith, and gone up to the capitol to sacrifice,\nthese were Christians by hereditary profession. Such is my experience, and\nI think the case is the same elsewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe seemed to be speaking more for the sake of getting answers than of\nobjecting arguments. She paused again, and thought; then she said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMankind is made up of classes of very various mental complexion, as\ndistinct from each other as the colours which meet the eye. Red and blue\nare incommensurable; and in like manner, a Magian never can become a\nGreek, nor a Greek a C\u00c5\u0093licolist. They do but make themselves fools when\nthey attempt it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps the most deeply convinced, the most tranquil-minded in the\nChristian body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill tell you, on the contrary, that\nthere was a time when they hated Christianity, and despised and\nill-treated its professors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_I_ never did any such thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Callista, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince the day I first\nheard of it. I am not its enemy, but I cannot believe in it. I am sure I\nnever could; I never, never should be able.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it you cannot believe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems too beautiful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be anything else than a dream. It\nis a thing to talk about, but when you come near its professors you see it\nis impossible. A most beautiful imagination, _that_ is what it is. Most\nbeautiful its precepts, as far as I have heard of them; so beautiful, that\nin idea there is no difficulty. The mind runs along with them, as if it\ncould accomplish them without an effort. Well, its maxims are too\nbeautiful to be realized; and then on the other hand, its dogmas are too\ndismal, too shocking, too odious to be believed. They revolt me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch as what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked C\u00c3\u00a6cilius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch as this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Callista. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing will ever make me believe that\nall my people have gone and will go to an eternal Tartarus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad we not better confine ourselves to something more specific, more\ntangible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, gravely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose if one individual may have\nthat terrible lot, another may\u00e2\u0080\u0094both may, many may. Suppose I understand\nyou to say that you never will believe that _you_ will go to an eternal\nTartarus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista gave a slight start, and showed some uneasiness or displeasure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it not likely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you are better able to speak of\nyourself, and to form a judgment about yourself, than about others?\nPerhaps if you could first speak confidently about yourself, you would be\nin a better position to speak about others also.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in a calm tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat my place, after this life,\nis an everlasting Tartarus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you happy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked in turn.\n\nShe paused, looked down, and in a deep clear voice said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a\nsilence.\n\nThe priest began again: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps you have been growing in unhappiness for\nyears; is it so? you assent. You have a heavy burden at your heart, you\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well know what. And the chance is, that you _will_ grow in\nunhappiness for the next ten years to come. You will be more and more\nunhappy the longer you live. Did you live till you were an old woman, you\nwould not know how to bear your existence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista cried out as if in bodily pain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true, sir, whoever told\nyou. But how can you have the heart to say it, to insult and mock me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut let me go on. Listen, my child. Be\nbrave, and dare to look at things as they are. Every day adds to your\nburden. This is a law of your present being, somewhat more certain than\nthe assertion which you just now so confidently made, the impossibility of\nyour believing in that law. You cannot refuse to accept what is not an\nopinion, but a fact. I say this burden which I speak of is not simply a\ndogma of our creed, it is an undeniable fact of nature. You cannot change\nit by wishing; if you were to live on earth two hundred years, it would\nnot be reversed, it would be more and more true. At the end of two hundred\nyears you would be too miserable even for your worst enemy to rejoice in\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius spoke, as if half in soliloquy or meditation, though he was\nlooking towards Callista. The contrast between them was singular: he thus\nabstracted; she too, utterly forgetful of self, but absorbed in him, and\nshowing it by her eager eyes, her hushed breath, her anxious attitude. At\nlast she said impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFather, you are speaking to yourself; you\ndespise me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe priest looked straight at her with an open, untroubled smile, and\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista, do not doubt me, my poor child; you are in my heart. I\nwas praying for you shortly before you appeared. No; but, in so serious a\nmatter as attempting to save a soul, I like to speak to you in my Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsight. I am speaking to you, indeed I am, my child; but I am also pleading\nwith you on His behalf, and before His throne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis voice trembled as he spoke, but he soon recovered himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuffer\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was saying that if you lived five hundred years on earth,\nyou would but have a heavier load on you as time went on. But you will not\nlive, you will die. Perhaps you will tell me that you will then cease to\nbe. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe you think so. I may take for granted that you think\nwith me, and with the multitude of men, that you will still live, that you\nwill still be _you_. You will still be the same being, but deprived of\nthose outward stays and reliefs and solaces, which, such as they are, you\nnow enjoy. You will be yourself, shut up in yourself. I have heard that\npeople go mad at length when placed in solitary confinement. If, then, on\npassing hence, you are cut off from what you had here, and have only the\ncompany of yourself, I think your burden will be, so far, greater, not\nless than it is now.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose, for instance, you had still your love of conversing, and could\nnot converse; your love of the poets of your race, and no means of\nrecalling them; your love of music, and no instrument to play upon; your\nlove of knowledge, and nothing to learn; your desire of sympathy, and no\none to love: would not that be still greater misery?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me proceed a step further: supposing you were among those whom you\nactually did _not_ love; supposing you did _not_ like them, nor their\noccupations, and could not understand their aims; suppose there be, as\nChristians say, one Almighty God, and you did not like Him, and had no\ntaste for thinking of Him, and no interest in what He was and what He did;\nand supposing you found that there was nothing else anywhere but He, whom\nyou did not love and whom you wished away: would you not be still more\nwretched?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if this went on for ever, would you not be in great inexpressible\npain for ever?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuming then, first, that the soul always needs external objects to rest\nupon; next, that it has no prospect of any such when it leaves this\nvisible scene; and thirdly, that the hunger and thirst, the gnawing of the\nheart, where it occurs, is as keen and piercing as a flame; it will follow\nthere is nothing irrational in the notion of an eternal Tartarus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot answer you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Callista, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I do not believe the dogma\non that account a whit the more. My mind revolts from the notion. There\n_must_ be some way out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf, on the other hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, not noticing her\ninterruption, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif all your thoughts go one way; if you have needs,\ndesires, aims, aspirations, all of which demand an Object, and imply, by\ntheir very existence, that such an Object does exist also; and if nothing\nhere does satisfy them, and if there be a message which professes to come\nfrom that Object, of whom you already have the presentiment, and to teach\nyou about Him, and to bring the remedy you crave; and if those who try\nthat remedy say with one voice that the remedy answers; are you not bound,\nCallista, at least to look that way, to inquire into what you hear about\nit, and to ask for His help, if He be, to enable you to believe in Him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what a slave of mine used to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Callista, abruptly; \u00e2\u0080\u009c...\nand another, Agellius, hinted the same thing.... What is your remedy, what\nyour Object, what your love, O Christian teacher? Why are you all so\nmysterious, so reserved in your communications?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius was silent for a moment, and seemed at a loss for an answer. At\nlength he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery man is in that state which you confess of yourself.\nWe have no love for Him who alone lasts. We love those things which do not\nlast, but come to an end. Things being thus, He whom we ought to love has\ndetermined to win us back to Him. With this object He has come into His\nown world, in the form of one of us men. And in that human form He opens\nHis arms and woos us to return to Him, our Maker. This is our Worship,\nthis is our Love, Callista.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou talk as Chione,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Callista answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly that she felt, and you\nteach. She could not speak of her Master without blushing for joy.... And\nAgellius, when he said one word about his Master, he too began to\nblush....\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was plain that the priest could hardly command his feelings, and they\nsat for a short while in silence. Then Callista began, as if musing on\nwhat she had heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA loved One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet ideal; a passion so potent, so fresh, so\ninnocent, so absorbing, so expulsive of other loves, so enduring, yet of\nOne never beheld;\u00e2\u0080\u0094mysterious! It is our own notion of the First and only\nFair, yet embodied in a substance, yet dissolving again into a sort of\nimagination.... It is beyond me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is but one Lover of souls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand He loves each one\nof us, as though there were no one else to love. He died for each one of\nus, as if there were no one else to die for. He died on the shameful\ncross. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Amor meus crucifixus est.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The love which he inspires lasts, for\nit is the love of the Unchangeable. It satisfies, for He is inexhaustible.\nThe nearer we draw to Him, the more triumphantly does He enter into us;\nthe longer He dwells in us, the more intimately have we possession of Him.\nIt is an espousal for eternity. This is why it is so easy for us to die\nfor our faith, at which the world marvels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPresently he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy will not _you_ approach Him? why will not you\nleave the creature for the Creator?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista seldom lost her self-possession; for a moment she lost it now;\ntears gushed from her eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat, I? you do not\nknow me, father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She paused, and then resumed in a different tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\n_my_ lot is one way, yours another. I am a child of Greece, and have no\nhappiness but that, such as it is, which my own bright land, my own\nglorious race, give me. I may well be content, I may well be resigned, I\nmay well be proud, if I possess _that_ happiness. I must live and die\nwhere I have been born. I am a tree which will not bear transplanting. The\nAssyrians, the Jews, the Egyptians, have their own mystical teaching. They\nfollow their happiness in their own way; mine is a different one. The\npride of mind, the revel of the intellect, the voice and eyes of genius,\nand the fond beating heart, I cannot do without them. I cannot do without\nwhat you, Christian, call sin. Let me alone; such as nature made me I will\nbe. I cannot change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis sudden revulsion of her feelings quite overcame C\u00c3\u00a6cilius; yet, while\nthe disappointment thrilled through him, he felt a most strange sympathy\nfor the poor lost girl, and his reply was full of emotion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAm _I_ a Jew?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe exclaimed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cam _I_ an Egyptian, or an Assyrian? Have I from my youth\nbelieved and possessed what now is my Life, my Hope, and my Love? Child,\n_what_ was once my life? Am not _I_ too a brand plucked out of the fire?\nDo _I_ deserve anything but evil? Is it not the Power, the Mighty Power of\nthe only Strong, the only Merciful, the grace of Emmanuel, which has\nchanged and won me? If He can change me, an old man, could He not change a\nchild like you? I, a proud, stern Roman; I, a lover of pleasure, a man of\nletters, of political station, with formed habits, and life-long\nassociations, and complicated relations; was it _I_ who wrought this great\nchange in me, who gained for myself the power of hating what I once loved,\nof unlearning what I once knew, nay, of even forgetting what once I was?\nWho has made you and me to differ, but He who can, when He will, make us\nto agree? It is His same Omnipotence which will transform _you_, if you\nwill but come to be transformed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut a reaction had come over the proud and sensitive mind of the Greek\ngirl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo after all, priest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are but a man like others; a\nfrail, guilty person like myself. I can find plenty of persons who do as I\ndo; I want some one who does not; I want some one to worship. I thought\nthere was something in you special and extraordinary. There was a\ngentleness and tenderness mingled with your strength which was new to me.\nI said, Here is at last a god. My own gods are earthly, sensual; I have no\nrespect for them, no faith in them. But there is nothing better anywhere\nelse.... Alas!...\u00e2\u0080\u009d She started up, and said with vehemence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you\nsinless; you confess to crime.... Ah! how do I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued with a\nshudder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you are better than those base hypocrites, priests of Isis\nor Mithras, whose lustrations, initiations, new birth, white robes, and\nlaurel crowns, are but the instrument and cloak of their intense\ndepravity?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she felt for the clasp upon her shoulder.\n\nHere her speech was interrupted by a hoarse sound, borne upon the wind as\nof many voices blended into one and softened by the distance, but which,\nunder the circumstances, neither of the parties to the above conversation\nhad any difficulty in assigning to its real cause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe enemy is upon you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XX.\n\n\n                      HE SHALL NOT LOSE HIS REWARD.\n\n\nThere was no room for doubt or for delay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is to become of you,\nCallista?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey will tear you to pieces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear nothing for me, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am one of them. They know\nme. Alas, _I_ am no Christian! _I_ have not abjured their rites! but you,\nlose not a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are still at some distance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough the wind gives us\nmerciful warning of their coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked about the room, and took up\nthe books of Holy Scripture which were on the shelf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing\nelse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof special value here. Agellius could not take them.\nHere, my child, I am going to show you a great confidence. To few persons\nnot Christians would I show it. Take this blessed parchment; it contains\nthe earthly history of our Divine Master. Here you will see whom we\nChristians love. Read it; keep it safely; surrender it, when you have the\nopportunity, into Christian keeping. My mind tells me I am not wrong in\nlending it to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He handed to her the Gospel of St. Luke, while he put\nthe two other volumes into the folds of his own tunic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne word more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour name, should I want you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took up a piece of chalk from the shelf, and wrote upon the wall in\ndistinct characters,\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThascius C\u00c3\u00a6cilius Cyprianus, Bishop of Carthage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHardly had she read the inscription when the voices of several men were\nheard in the very neighbourhood of the cottage; and hoping to effect a\ndiversion in favour of C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, and being at once unsuspicious of danger\nto herself, and careless of her life, she ran quickly forward to meet\nthem. C\u00c3\u00a6cilius ought to have taken to flight without a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delay, but\na last sacred duty detained him. He knelt down and took the pyx from his\nbosom. He had eaten nothing that day; but even if otherwise, it was a\ncrisis which allowed him to consume the sacred species without fasting. He\nhastily opened the golden case, adored the blessed sacrament, and consumed\nit, purifying its receptacle, and restoring it to its hiding-place. Then\nhe rose at once and left the cottage.\n\nHe looked about; Callista was nowhere to be seen. She was gone; so much\nwas certain, no enemy was in sight; it only remained for him to make off\ntoo. In the confusion he turned in the wrong direction; instead of making\noff at the back of the cottage from which the voices had scared him, he\nran across the garden into the hollow way. It was all over with him in an\ninstant; he fell at once into the hands of the vanguard of the mob.\n\nMany mouths were opened upon him all at once. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sorcerer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried one;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctear him to shreds; _we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll_ teach him to brew his spells against the\ncity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive us back our grapes and corn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a second. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave a guard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid a third; \u00e2\u0080\u009che can turn you into swine or asses while there is breath\nin him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen be the quicker with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a fourth, who was lifting up\na crowbar to discharge upon his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a tall swarthy youth,\nwho had already warded off several blows from him, \u00e2\u0080\u009chold, will you? don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou see, if you kill him he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t undo the spell. Make him first reverse\nit all; make him take the curse off us. Bring him along; take him to\nAstarte, Hercules, or old Saturn. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll broil him on a gridiron till he\nturns all these canes into vines, and makes olive berries of the pebbles,\nand turns the dust of the earth into fine flour for our eating. When he\nhas done all this he shall dance a jig with a wild cow, and sit down to\nsupper with an hyena.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA loud scream of exultation broke forth from the drunken and frantic\nmultitude. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlong with him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the same speaker in a jeering tone.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, put him on the ass and tie his hands behind his back. He shall go\nback in triumph to the city which he loves. Mind, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch him\nbefore the time. If you kill him, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never get the curse off. Come\nhere, you priests of Cybele,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand be his body-guard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he\ncontinued to keep a vigilant eye and hand over the old man, in spite of\nthem.\n\nThe ass, though naturally a good-tempered beast, had been most sadly tried\nthrough the day. He had been fed, indeed, out of mockery, as being the\nChristians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 god; but he did not understand the shouts and caprices of the\ncrowd, and he only waited for an opportunity to show that he by no means\nacquiesced in the proceedings of the day. And now the difficulty was to\nmove at all. The people kept crowding up the hollow road, and blocked the\npassage, and though the greater part of the rioters had either been left\nbehind exhausted in Sicca itself, or had poured over the fields on each\nside of Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cottage, or gone right over the hill down into the\nvalley beyond, yet still it was some time before the ass could move a\nstep, and a time of nervous suspense it was both to C\u00c3\u00a6cilius and the youth\nwho befriended him. At length what remained of the procession was\npersuaded to turn about and make for Sicca, but in a reversed order. It\ncould not be brought round in so confined a space, so its rear went first\nand the ass and its burden came last. As they descended the hill back\nagain, C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, who was mounted upon the linen and silk which had adorned\nthe Dea Syra before the Tertullianist had destroyed the idol, saw before\nhim the whole line of march. In front were flaunted the dreadful emblems\nof idolatry, so far as their bearers were able still to raise them.\nDrunken women, ragged boys mounted on men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders, ruffians and\nbullies, savage-looking Getulians, half-human monsters from the Atlas,\nmonkeys and curs jabbering and howling, mummers, bacchanals, satyrs, and\ngesticulators, formed the staple of the procession. Midway between the\nhill which he was descending and the city lay the ravine, of which we have\nseveral times spoken, widening out into the plain or Campus Martius, which\nreached round to the steep cliffs on the north. The bridle-path, along\nwhich he was moving, crossed it just where it was opening and became\nlevel, so as to present no abrupt descent and ascent at the place where\nthe path was lowest. On the left every vestige of the ravine soon ceased,\nand a free passage extended to the plain.\n\nThe youth who had placed C\u00c3\u00a6cilius on the ass still kept close to him and\nsung at the pitch of his voice, in imitation of the rest\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSporting and snorting in shades of the night,\n  His ears pricking up, and his hoofs striking light,\n  And his tail whisking round, in the speed of his flight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOld man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued to C\u00c3\u00a6cilius in a low voice, and in Latin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour\ncurse has not worked on me yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are granted one day more for\nrepentance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLucky for you as well as for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply: and he continued his\nsong:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGurta, the witch, was out with the rest;\n  Though as lame as a gull, by his highness possessed,\n  She shouldered her crutch, and danced with the best.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe stamped and she twirled in the shade of the yew,\n  Till her gossips and chums of the city danced too;\n  They never are slack when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mischief to do.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe danced and she coaxed, but he was no fool;\n  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be his own master, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d not be her tool:\n  Not the little black moor should send him to school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe then turned to C\u00c3\u00a6cilius and whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, old father, that\nothers, besides Christians, can forgive and forget. Henceforth call me\ngenerous Juba.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he tossed his head.\n\nBy this time they had got to the bottom of the hill, and the deep shadows\nwhich filled the hollow showed that the sun was rapidly sinking in the\nwest. Suddenly, as they were crossing the bottom as it opened into the\nplain, Juba seized and broke the thong which bound C\u00c3\u00a6cilius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, and\nbestowing a tremendous cut with it upon the side of the ass, sent him\nforward upon the plain at his greatest speed. The youth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man\u00c5\u0093uvre was\nsuccessful to the full. The asses of Africa can do more on an occasion of\nthis kind than our own. C\u00c3\u00a6cilius for the moment lost his seat; but,\ninstantly recovering it, took care to keep the animal from flagging; and\nthe cries of the mob, and the howlings of the priests of Cybele cooperated\nin the task. At length the gloom, increasing every minute, hid him from\ntheir view; and even in daylight his recapture would have been a difficult\nmatter for a wearied-out, famished, and intoxicated rabble. Before\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius well had time to return thanks for this unexpected turn of\nevents, he was out of pursuit, and was ambling at a pace more suitable to\nthe habits of the beast of burden that carried him, over an expanse of\nplain which would have been a formidable night-march to a fasting man.\n\n\n\nWe must not conclude the day without relating what was its issue to the\npersecutors, as well as to their intended victim. It is almost a proverb\nthat punishment is slow in overtaking crime; but the present instance was\nan exception to the rule. While the exiled Bishop of Carthage escaped, the\ncrowd, on the other hand, were caught in the trap which had been laid for\nthem. We have already said it was a _ruse_ on the part of the governing\nauthorities of the place to get the rioters out of the city, that they\nmight at once be relieved of them, and then deal with them just as they\nmight think fit. When the mob was once outside the walls, they might be\nrefused re-admittance, and put down with a strong hand. The Roman\ngarrison, who, powerless to quell the tumult in the narrow and winding\nstreets and multiplied alleys of the city, had been the authors of the\nman\u00c5\u0093uvre, now took on themselves the stern completion of it, and\ndetermined to do so in the sternest way. Not a single head of all those\nwho poured out in the afternoon should return at night. It was not to be\nsupposed that the soldiers had any tenderness for the Christians, but they\nabominated and despised the rabble of the town. They were indignant at\ntheir rising, thought it a personal insult to themselves, and resolved\nthey should never do so again. The gates were commonly in the custody of\nthe city guard, but the Porta Septimiana, by which the mob passed out, was\non this occasion claimed by the Romans. It was most suitably circumstanced\nfor the use they intended to make of it. Immediately outside of it was a\nlarge court of the same level as the ground inside, bordered on the right\nand left by substantial walls, which after a time were drawn to meet each\nother, and contracted the space to the usual breadth of a road. The walls\ncontinued to run along this road for some distance, till they joined the\nway which led to the Campus Martius, and from this point the ground was\nopen till it reached the head of the ravine. The soldiers drew up at the\ngate, and as the worn-out and disappointed, brutalized and half-idiotic\nmultitudes returned towards it from the country, those who were behind\npushed on between the border walls those who were in front, and, while\nthey jammed together their ranks, also made escape impossible. It was now\nthat the Roman soldiers began their barbarous, not to say cowardly,\nassault upon them. With heavy maces, with the pike, with iron gauntlets,\nwith stones and bricks, with clubs, with scourge, with the sword, with the\nhelmet, with whatever came to hand, they commenced the massacre of that\nlarge concourse of human beings, who did not offer one blow in return.\nThey slaughtered them like sheep; they trampled them down; they threw the\nbodies of the wounded over the walls. Attempting to run back, numbers of\nthe poor wretches came into conflict with the ranks behind them, and an\nadditional scene of confusion and overthrow took place; many of them\nstraggled over to the open country or woods, and perished, either from the\nweather, or from hunger, or even from the wild beasts. Others, weakened by\nexcess and famine, fell a prey to the pestilence that was raging. After\nsome days a remnant of them was allowed silently and timidly to steal back\ninto the city as best they could. It was a long day before the Plebs\nSiccensis ventured to have any opinion of its own upon the subject of\nChristianity, or any other political, social, or ecclesiastical topic\nwhatever.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n                            STARTLING RUMOURS.\n\n\nWhen Jucundus rose next morning, and heard the news, he considered it to\nbe more satisfactory than he could have supposed possible. He was a\nzealous imperialist, and a lover of tranquillity, a despiser of the\nnatives and a hater of the Christians. The Christians had suffered enough\nto vindicate the Roman name, to deter those who were playing at\nChristianity, and to show that the people of Sicca had their eyes about\nthem. And the mob had received a severe lesson too; and the cause of\npublic order had triumphed, and civic peace was re-established. His\nanxiety, too, about Agellius had terminated, or was terminating. He had\nprivately denounced him to the government, come to an understanding with\nthe military authorities, and obtained the custody of him. He had met him\nat the very door to which the boy Firmian brought him, with an apparitor\nof the military staff (or what answered to it), and had clapped him into\nprison in an underground cellar in which he kept damaged images, and those\nwhich had gone out of fashion, and were otherwise unsaleable. He was not\nat all sorry, by some suffering, and by some fright, to aid the more\npotent incantation which Callista was singing in his ears. He did not,\nhowever, at all forget Juba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hint, and was careful not to overdo the\nrack-and-gridiron dodge, if we may so designate it; yet he thought just a\nflavour or a thought of the inconveniences which the profession of\nChristianity involved might be a salutary reflection in the midst of the\npersuasives which the voice and eyes of Callista would kindle in his\nheart. There was nothing glorious or heroic in being confined in a lumber\ncellar, no one knowing anything about it; and he did not mean to keep him\nthere for ever.\n\nAs the next day wore on towards evening, rumour brought a piece of news\nwhich he was at first utterly unable to credit, and which for the moment\nseemed likely to spoil the appetite which promised so well for his evening\nrepast. He could hardly believe his ears when he was told that Callista\nwas in arrest on a charge of Christianity, and at first it made him look\nas black as some of those Egyptian gods which he had on one shelf of his\nshop. However, he rallied, and was very much amused at the report. The\nimprisonment indeed was a fact, account for it as one could; but who\n_could_ account for it? \u00e2\u0080\u009cVarium et mutabile:\u00e2\u0080\u009d who could answer for the\nwhims and fancies of womankind? If she had fallen in love with the owl of\nMinerva, or cut off her auburn tresses, or turned rope-dancer, there might\nhave been some shrugging of shoulders, but no one would have tried to\nanalyze the motive; but so much his profound sagacity enabled him to see,\nthat, if there was one thing more than another likely to sicken Agellius\nof Christianity, it was to find one who was so precious to him suffering\nfrom the suspicion of it. It was bad enough to have suffered one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self in\nsuch a cause; still he could conceive, he was large-minded enough to\ngrant, that Agellius might have some secret satisfaction in the antagonist\nfeeling of resentment and obstinacy which that suffering might engender:\nbut it was carrying matters too far, and no comfort in any point of view,\nto find Callista, his beloved, the object of a similar punishment. It was\nall very well to profess Christianity as a matter of sentiment, mystery,\nand singularity; but when it was found to compromise the life or limbs of\nanother, and that other Callista, why it was plain that Agellius would be\nthe very first to try and entreat the wayward girl to keep her good looks\nfor him, and to be loyal to the gods of her country; and he chuckled over\nthe thought, as others have done in other states of society, of a\nlove-scene or a marriage being the termination of so much high romance and\nfine acting.\n\nHowever, the next day Aristo came down to him himself, and gave him an\naccount at once more authentic and more extended on the matter which\ninterested him. Callista had been called up before the tribunal, and had\nnot been discharged, but remanded. The meaning of it was as obscure as\never; Aristo could give no account of it; it almost led him to believe in\nthe evil eye; some unholy practices, some spells such as only potent\nwizards know, some deplorable delusion or hallucination, had for the time\ngot the mastery of his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. No one seemed quite to know how she\nhad found her way into the hands of the officers; but there she was, and\nthe problem was how to get her out of them.\n\nHowever, whatever mystery, whatever anxiety, attached to the case, it was\nonly still more urgent to bring the matter home to Agellius without delay.\nIf time went on before the parties were brought together, she might grow\nmore obstinate, and kindle a like spirit in him. Oh that boys and girls\n_would_ be giving old people, who wish them well, so much trouble!\nHowever, it was no good thinking of that just then. He considered that, at\nthe present moment, they would not be able to bear the sight of each other\nin suffering and peril; that mutual tenderness would make them plead with\neach other in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf, and that each would be obliged to set\nthe example to each of a concession, to which each exhorted each; and on\nthis fine philosophical view he proceeded to act.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n              JUCUNDUS PROPOUNDS HIS VIEW OF THE SITUATION.\n\n\nFor thirty-six hours Agellius had been confined in his underground\nreceptacle, light being almost excluded, a bench and a rug being his means\nof repose, and a full measure of bread, wine, and olives being his dole.\nThe shrieks and yells of the rioters could be distinctly heard in his\nprison, as the day of his seizure went on, and they passed by the temple\nof Astarte; but what happened at his farm, and how it fared with C\u00c3\u00a6cilius,\nhe had no means of conjecturing; nor indeed how it was to fare with\nhimself, for on the face of the transaction, as was in form the fact, he\nwas in the hands of the law, and only indulged with the house of a\nrelative for his prison. On the second night he was released by his\nuncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidential slave, who brought him up to a small back closet on\nthe ground floor, which was lighted from the roof, and next morning, being\nthe second day after the riot, Jucundus came in to have his confidential\nconversation with him.\n\nHis uncle began by telling him that he was a government prisoner, but that\nhe hoped by his influence in high places to get him off and out of Sicca\nwithout any prejudice to his honour. He told him that he had managed it\nprivately, and if he had treated him with apparent harshness up to the\nevening before, it was in order to save appearances with the apparitors\nwho had attended him. He then went on to inform him that the mob had\nvisited his cottage, and had caught some man there; he supposed some\naccomplice or ally of his nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. They had seized him, and were bringing\nhim off, but the fellow had been clever enough to effect his escape. He\ndid not know more than this, but it had happened very fortunately, for the\ngeneral belief in the place was, that it was Agellius who had been taken,\nand who had managed to give them the slip. Since it could not any longer\nbe safely denied that he was a Christian, though he (Jucundus) did not\nthink so himself, he had encouraged or rather had given his confirmation\nto the report; and when some persons who had means of knowing had asserted\nthat the culprit was double the age of his nephew and more, and not at all\nof his make or description, but a sort of slave, or rather that he was the\nslave of Agellius who had belonged to his father Strabo, Jucundus had\nboldly asserted that Agellius, in the emergency, had availed himself of\nsome of the remarkably powerful charms which Christians were known to\npossess, and had made himself seem what he really was not, in order to\nescape detection. It had not indeed answered the purpose entirely, for he\nhad actually been taken; but no blame in the charm, which perhaps, after\nall, had enabled him to escape. However, Agellius was gone, he told\npeople, and a good riddance, and he hoped never to see him again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you\nsee, my dear boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis was all talk for the occasion, for\nI hope you will live here many years in respectability and credit. I\nintend you should close my eyes when my time comes, and inherit whatever I\nhave to leave you; for as to that fellow Juba, he inspires me with no\nconfidence in him at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius thanked his uncle with all his heart for his kind and successful\nefforts on his behalf; he did not think there was a word he had said, in\nthe future he had sketched for him, which he could have wished altered.\nBut he thought Jucundus over-sanguine; much as he should like to live with\nhim and tend him in his old age, he did not think he should ever be\npermitted to return to Sicca. He was a Christian, and must seek some\nremote corner of the world, or at least some city where he was unknown.\nEvery one in Sicca would point at him as the Christian; he would\nexperience a thousand rubs and collisions, even if the mob did not rise\nagainst him, without corresponding advantage; on the other hand, he would\nhave no influence. But were he in the midst of a powerful and\nwidely-extended community of Christians, he might in his place do work,\nand might extend the faith as one of a number, unknown himself, and strong\nin his brethren. He therefore proposed as soon as possible to sell his\neffects and stock, and retire from the sight of men, at least for a time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think this persecution, then, will be soon at an end?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked\nJucundus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI judge by the past,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere have been times of trial\nand of rest hitherto, and I suppose it will be so again. And one place has\nhitherto been exempt from the violence of our enemies, when another has\nbeen the scene of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA new time is coming, trust me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, gravely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose popular\ncommotions are all over. What happened two days ago is a sample of what\nwill come of them; they have received their _coup-de-gr\u00c3\u00a2ce_. The State is\ntaking up the matter, Rome itself, thank the gods! a tougher sort of\ncustomer than these villain ratcatchers and offal-eaters, whom you had to\ndo with two days since. Great Rome is now at length in earnest, my boy,\nwhich she ought to have been a long time back, before you were born; and\nthen you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he nodded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would have had no choice; you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave had the temptation to make a fool of yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif a new time is really coming, there is\nless chance than ever of my continuing here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow be a sensible fellow, as you are when you choose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his uncle;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clook the matter in the face, do. You cannot wrestle with impossibilities,\nyou cannot make facts to pattern. There are lawful religions, there are\nillicit. Christianity is illicit; it is not tolerated; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not your\nfault; you cannot help it; you would, if you could; you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Now you\nhave observed your point of honour; you have shown you can stand up like a\nman, and suffer for your own fancy. Still Rome does not give way; and you\nmust make the best of it. You must give in, and you are far too good (I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compliment, I speak my mind), far too amiable, excellent, sweet a\nboy for so rascally a superstition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is something stronger than Rome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the nephew almost sternly.\n\nJucundus cut him short. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must not say that in\nthis house. You shall not use that language under my roof. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not put up\nwith it, I tell you. Take your treason elsewhere.... This accursed\nobstinacy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I must take care what I am doing;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthen aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, we both of us have been railing; no good comes of\nrailing; railing is not argument. But now, I say, do be sensible, if you\ncan. Is not the imperial government in earnest now? better late than\nnever, but it is now in earnest. And now mark my words, by this day five\nyears, five years at the utmost,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I say by this day five years there will\nnot be a single ragamuffin Christian in the whole Roman world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he\nlooked fierce. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe gods! Rome, Rome has swept from the earth by her very\nbreath conspiracies, confederacies, plots against her, without ever\nfailing; she will do so now with this contemptible, Jew-begotten foe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn what are we enemies to Rome, Jucundus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy will you\nalways take it for granted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake it for granted!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it not on the face of the matter?\nI suppose _they_ are enemies to a state, whom the state _calls_ its\nenemies. Besides, why a pother of words? Swear by the genius of the\nemperor, invoke the Dea Roma, sacrifice to Jove; no, not a bit of it, not\na whisper, not a sign, not a grain of incense. You go out of your way to\ninsult us; and then you come with a grave face, and say you are loyal. You\nkick our shins, and you wish us to kiss you on both cheeks for it. A few\nharmless ceremonies; we are not entrapping you; we are not using your\nwords against yourselves; we tell you the meaning beforehand, the whole\nmeaning of them. It is not as if we tied you to the belief of the nursery:\nwe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you burn incense, you profess to believe that old\nJupiter is shivering atop of Olympus;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You swear by the\ngenius of C\u00c3\u00a6sar, therefore he has a genius, black, or white, or piebald,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nNo, we give you the meaning of the act; it is a mere expression of loyalty\nto the empire. If then you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it, you confess yourself _ipso facto_\ndisloyal. It is incomprehensible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he had become quite red.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI give you my solemn word, that the\npeople whom you so detest do pray for the welfare of the imperial power\ncontinually, as a matter of duty and as a matter of interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPray! pray! fudge and nonsense!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Jucundus, almost mimicking him in\nhis indignation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cpray! who thanks you for your prayers? what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good\nof prayers? Prayers, indeed! ha, ha! A little loyalty is worth all the\npraying in the world. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what, Agellius; you are, I am sorry to\nsay it, but you are hand and glove with a set of traitors, who shall and\nwill be smoked out like a nest of wasps. _You_ don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know; _you_ are not\nin the secret, nor the wretched slave, poor beast, who was pulled to\npieces yesterday (ah! you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know of him) at the Flamen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, nor a\nmultitude of other idiots. But, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he chucked up his head\nsignificantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are puppets, and there are wires. Few know what is\ngoing on. They won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have done (unless we put them down; but we will) till\nthey have toppled down the state. But Rome will put them down. Come, be\nsensible, listen to reason; now I am going to put facts before my poor,\ndear, well-meaning boy. Oh that you saw things as I do! What a trouble you\nare to me! Here am I\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dearest uncle, Jucundus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI assure you, it is the\nmost intense pain to me\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted the uncle in turn, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe it, of\ncourse I believe it; but listen, listen. Every now and then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued\nin a more measured and lower tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery now and then the secret is\nblabbed\u00e2\u0080\u0094blabbed. There was that Tertullianus of Carthage, some fifty years\nsince. He wrote books; books have done a great deal of harm before now;\nbut _read_ his books\u00e2\u0080\u0094read and ponder. The fellow has the insolence to tell\nthe proconsul that he and the whole government, the whole city and\nprovince, the whole Roman world, the emperors, all but the pitiful\n_clique_ to which he belongs, are destined, after death, to flames for\never and ever. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyalty! but the absurdity is greater than the\nmalevolence. Rightly are the fellows called atheists and men-haters. Our\nsoldiers, our statesmen, our magistrates, and judges, and senators, and\nthe whole community, all worshippers of the gods, every one who crowns his\nhead, every one who loves a joke, and all our great historic names,\nheroes, and worthies,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Scipios, the Decii, Brutus, C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Cato, Titus,\nTrajan, Antoninus,\u00e2\u0080\u0094are inmates, not of the Elysian fields, if Elysian\nfields there be, but of Tartarus, and will never find a way out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat man, Tertullianus, is nothing to us, uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\nman of great ability, but he quarrelled with us, and left us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_I_ can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t draw nice distinctions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour people have\nquarrelled among themselves perhaps on an understanding; we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t split\nhairs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same with your present hierophant at Carthage, Cyprianus.\nNothing can exaggerate, I am told, the foulness of his attack upon the\ngods of Rome, upon Romulus, the Augurs, the Ancilia, the consuls, and\nwhatever a Roman is proud of. As to the imperial city itself, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhardly one of their high priests that has not died under the hands of the\nexecutioner, as a convict. The precious fellows take the title of Pontifex\nMaximus; bless their impudence! Well, my boy, this is what I say; be, if\nyou will, so preternaturally sour and morose as to misconceive and mislike\nthe innocent, graceful, humanising, time-honoured usages of society; be\nso, for what I care, if this is all; but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all. Such misanthropy is\nwisdom, absolute wisdom, compared with the Titanic presumption and\naudacity of challenging to single combat the sovereign of the world. Go\nand kick down Mount Atlas first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have it all your own way, Jucundus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his nephew, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand so you\nmust move in your own circle, round and round. There is no touching you,\nif you first assume your premisses, and then prove them by means of your\nconclusion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Agellius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his uncle, giving his head a very solemn shake,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctake the advice of an old man. When you are older than you are, you will\nsee better who is right and who is wrong. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sorry you despised me,\na true, a prudent, an experienced friend; you will. Shake yourself, come\ndo. Why should you link your fortunes, in the morning of life, with\ndesperate men, only because your father, in his last feeble days, was\nentrapped into doing so? I really will not believe that you are going to\nthrow away hope and life on so bad a bargain. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak a word? Here\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve let me speak, and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say one syllable for yourself. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthink it kind of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus adjured, Agellius began. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long history; you\nsee, we start, my dear uncle, from different points. How am I possibly to\njoin issue with you? I can only tell you my conclusion. Hope and life, you\nsay. Why, my only hope, my only life, my only joy, desire, consolation,\nand treasure is that I am a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHope and life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmortal gods! life and hope in\nbeing a Christian! do I hear aright? Why, man, a prison brings despair,\nnot hope; and the sword brings death, not life. By Esculapius! life and\nhope! you choke me, Agellius. Life and hope! you are beyond three\nAnticyras. Life and hope! if you were old, if you were diseased, if you\nwere given over, and had but one puff of life left in you, then you might\nbe what you would, for me; but your hair is black, your cheek is round,\nyour limbs are strong, your voice is full; and you are going to make all\nthese a sacrifice to Hecate! has your good genius fed that plump frame,\nripened those goods looks, nerved your arm, bestowed that breadth of\nchest, that strength of loins, that straightness of spine, that vigour of\nstep, only that you may feed the crows? or to be torn on the rack,\nscorched in the flame, or hung on the gibbet? is this your gratitude to\nnature? What has been your price? for what have you sold yourself? Speak,\nman, speak. Are you dumb as well as dement? Are you dumb, I say, are you\ndumb?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Jucundus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius, irritated at his own inability to express\nhimself or hold an argument, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you did but know what it was to have the\nTruth! The Christian has found the Truth, the eternal Truth, in a world of\nerror. That is his bargain, that is his hire; can there be a greater? Can\nI give up the Truth? But all this is Punic or Barbar to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt certainly did pose Jucundus for half a minute, as if he was trying to\ntake in, not so much the sense, as the words of his nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech. He\nlooked bewildered, and though he began to answer him at once, it took\nseveral sentences to bring him into his usual flow of language. After one\nor two exclamations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe truth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_this_ is what I understand\nyou to say,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the truth. The _truth_ is your bargain; I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m right, the\ntruth; Hm; what is truth? What in heaven and earth do you mean by truth?\nwhere did you get that cant? What oriental tomfoolery is bamboozling you?\nThe truth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, staring at him with eyes, half of triumph, half of\nimpatience, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe truth! Jove help the boy!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the truth! can truth pour me\nout a cup of melilotus? can truth crown me with flowers? can it sing to\nme? can it bring Glyceris to me? drop gold into my girdle? or cool my\nbrows when fever visits me? Can truth give me a handsome suburban with\nsome five hundred slaves, or raise me to the duumvirate? Let it do this,\nand I will worship it; it shall be my god; it shall be more to me than\nFortune, Fate, Rome, or any other goddess on the list. But _I_ like to\nsee, and touch, and feel, and handle, and weigh, and measure what is\npromised me. I wish to have a sample and an instalment. I am too old for\nchaff. Eat, drink, and be merry, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my philosophy, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my religion;\nand I know no better. To-day is ours, to-morrow is our children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a pause, he added, bitterly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf truth could get Callista out of\nprison, instead of getting her into it, I should have something to say to\ntruth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista in prison!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius with surprise and distress, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do\nyou mean, Jucundus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact; Callista _is_ in prison,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand on\nsuspicion of Christianity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista! Christianity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, bewildered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo I hear aright?\nShe a Christian! oh, impossible, uncle! you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to say that she is\nin prison. Tell me, tell me, my dear, dear Jucundus, what this wonderful\nnews means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to know more about it than I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif there is any\nmeaning in it. But if you want my opinion, here it is. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe she\nis more a Christian than I am; but I think she is over head and ears in\nlove with you, and she has some notion that she is paying you a\ncompliment, or interesting you in her, or sharing your fate\u00e2\u0080\u0094(_I_ can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\npretend to unravel the vagaries and tantarums of the female mind)\u00e2\u0080\u0094by\nsaying that she is what she is _not_. If not, perhaps she has done it out\nof spite and contradiction. You can never answer for a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom should she spite? whom contradict?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius, thrown for the\nmoment off his balance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Callista! Callista in prison for Christianity!\nOh if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that she is a Christian! but what if she is not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added\nwith great terror, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, and yet in prison, as if she were?\nHow are we to get her out, uncle? Impossible! no, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a\nChristian\u00e2\u0080\u0094she is not at all. She ought not to be there! Yet how\nwonderful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I am sure of it, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d stake the best image in\nmy shop that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a Christian; but what if she is perverse enough to\nsay she _is_? and such things are not uncommon. Then, I say, what in the\nworld is to be done? If she says she is, why she is. There you are; and\nwhat can you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Agellius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat that sweet delicate\nchild is in that horrible hole; impossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he nearly shrieked at the\nthought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the meaning of it all? dear, dear uncle, do tell me\nsomething more about it. Why did you not tell me before? What _can_ be\ndone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJucundus thought he now had him in his hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nanswered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat can be _done_. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no Christian, we both agree. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncertain, too, that she chooses to say she is, or something like it.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just one person who has influence with her, to make her tell the\ntruth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius, starting as if an asp had bitten him.\n\nJucundus kept silence, and let the poison of the said asp work awhile in\nhis nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood.\n\nAgellius put his hands before his eyes; and with his elbows on his knees,\nbegan moving to and fro, as if in intense pain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI repeat what I have said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jucundus observed at length; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do really\nthink that she imagines a certain young gentleman is likely to be in\ntrouble, and that she is determined to share the trouble with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius with great vehemence; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not\ntrue.... If she really is not a Christian, O my dear Lord, surely they\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put her to death as if she was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if she has made up her mind to be in the same boat with you, and\n_will_ be a Christian while you are a Christian, what on earth can we do,\nAgellius?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Jucundus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the whole matter in a nutshell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe does not love me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Agellius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno, she has given me no reason to\nthink so. I am sure she does not. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to me. That cannot be the\nreason of her conduct. _I_ have no power over her; _I_ could not persuade\nher. What, what _does_ all this mean? and I shut up here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he began\nwalking about the little room, as if such locomotion tended to bring him\nout of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is easy to ascertain. I suppose you _could_\nbe let out to see her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he was going on too fast; Agellius did not attend to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor, sweet\nCallista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innocent, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innocent; I mean she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not\na Christian. Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he screamed out in great agony, as the whole state of\nthe case unrolled itself to his apprehension, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe will die though not a\nChristian; she will die without faith, without love; she will die in her\nsins. She will die, done to death by false report of accepting that, by\nwhich alone she could be carried safely through death unto life. O my\nLord, spare me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he sank upon the ground in a collapse of misery.\n\nJucundus was touched, and still more alarmed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will rouse the whole neighbourhood. Give over; be a man; all\nwill be right. If she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a Christian (and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not), she shall not die\na Christian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death; something will turn up. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in any hole at all,\nbut in a decent lodging. And you shall see her, and console her, and all\nwill be right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I will see her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, in a sort of musing manner; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is\neither a Christian, or she is not. If she is a Christian ...\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his\nvoice faltered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut if she is not, she shall live till she is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell said!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_till_ she is. She shall live _till_ she\nis. Yes, I can get you to see her. You shall bring her out of prison; a\nsmile, a whisper from you, and all her fretfulness and ill-humour will\nvanish, like a mist before the powerful burning sun. And we shall all be\nas happy as the immortal gods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO my uncle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius, gravely. The language of Jucundus had shocked\nhim, and brought him to a better mind. He turned away from Jucundus, and\nleant his face against the wall. Then he turned round again, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nshe _is_ a Christian, I ought to rejoice, and I do rejoice; God be\npraised. If she is not a Christian, I ought at once to make her one. If\nshe has already the penalty of a Christian, she is surely destined for the\nprivilege. And how should I go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, half speaking to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow\nshould I go to tell her that she is not yet a Christian, and bid her swear\nby Jupiter, because that is her god, in order that she may escape\nimprisonment and death? Am I to do the part of a heathen priest or infidel\nsophist? O C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, how am I forgetting your lessons! No; I will go on no\nsuch errand. Go, I will, if I may, Jucundus, but I will go on no\nconditions of yours. I go on no promise to try to get her out of prison\nanyhow, poor child. I will not go to make her sacrifice to a false god; I\ngo to persuade her to stay in prison, by deserving to stay. Perhaps I am\nnot the best person to go; but if I go, I go free. I go willing to die\nmyself for my Lord; glad to make her die for Him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius said this in so determined a way, so calmly, with such a grasp of\nthe existing posture of affairs, and of the whole circumstances of the\ncase, that it was now Jucundus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to feel surprise and annoyance. For\na time he did not take in what Agellius meant, nor could he to the last\nfollow his train of feeling. When he saw what may be called the upshot of\nthe matter, he became very angry, and spoke with great violence. By\ndegrees he calmed; and then the strong feeling came on him again that it\nwas impossible, if a meeting took place between the two, that it could end\nin any way but one. He defied any two young people who loved each other,\nto come to any but one conclusion. Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mood was too excited, too\ntragic to last. The sight of Callista in that dreadful prison, perhaps in\nchains, waiting, in order to be free, for ability to say the words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nnot a Christian;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that ability waiting for the same words from\nhimself, would bring the affair to a very speedy issue. As if he could\nlove a fancy better than he loved Callista! Agellius, too, had already\nexpressed a misgiving himself on that head; so far they were agreed. And,\nto tell the truth, it was a very difficult transaction for a young man;\nand giving our poor Agellius all credit for pure intention and firm\nresolve, we really should have been very sorry to see him involved in a\ntrial, which would have demanded of him a most heroic faith and the\ndetachment of a saint. We, therefore, are not sorry that in matter of fact\nhe gained the merit of so virtuous a determination, without being called\non to execute it. For it so happened, that a most unexpected event\noccurred to him not many hours afterwards, which will oblige us to take up\nhere rather abruptly the history of one of our other personages.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n                                  GURTA.\n\n\nIn the bosom of the woods which stretched for many miles from the\nimmediate environs of Sicca, and placed on a gravel slope reaching down to\na brook, which ran in a bottom close by, was a small, rude hut, of a kind\npeculiar to Africa, and commonly ascribed to the wandering tribes, who\nneither cared, nor had leisure for a more stable habitation. Some might\nhave called it a tent, from the goat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-hair cloth with which it was\ncovered; but it looked, as to shape, like nothing else than an inverted\nboat, or the roof of a house set upon the ground. Inside it was seen to be\nconstructed of the branches of trees, twisted together or wattled, the\ninterstices, or rather the whole surface, being covered with clay. Being\nthus stoutly built, lined, and covered, it was proof against the\ntremendous rains, to which the climate, for which it was made, was\nsubject. Along the centre ridge or backbone, which varied in height from\nsix to ten feet from the ground, it was supported by three posts or\npillars; at one end it rose conically to an open aperture, which served\nfor chimney, for sky-light, and for ventilator. Hooks were suspended from\nthe roof for baskets, articles of clothing, weapons, and implements of\nvarious kinds; and a second cone, excavated in the ground with the vertex\ndownward, served as a storehouse for grain. The door was so low, that an\nordinary person must bend double to pass through it.\n\nHowever, it was in the winter months only, when the rains were profuse,\nthat the owner of this respectable mansion condescended to creep into it.\nIn summer she had a drawing-room, as it may be called, of nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own\ncreation, in which she lived, and in one quarter of which she had her\nlair. Close above the hut was a high plot of level turf, surrounded by old\noaks, and fringed beneath with thick underwood. In the centre of this\ngreen rose a yew-tree of primeval character. Indeed, the whole forest\nspoke of the very beginnings of the world, as if it had been the immediate\ncreation of that Voice which bade the earth clothe itself with green life.\nBut the place no longer spoke exclusively of its Maker. Upon the trees\nhung the emblems and objects of idolatry, and the turf was traced with\nmagical characters. Littered about were human bones, horns of wild\nanimals, wax figures, spermaceti taken from vaults, large nails, to which\nportions of flesh adhered, as if they had had to do with malefactors,\nmetal plates engraved with strange characters, bottled blood, hair of\nyoung persons, and old rags. The reader must not suppose any incantation\nis about to follow, or that the place we are describing will have a\nprominent place in what remains of our tale; but even if it be the scene\nof only one conversation, and one event, there is no harm in describing\nit, as it appeared on that occasion.\n\nThe old crone, who was seated in this bower of delight, had an expression\nof countenance in keeping, not with the place, but with the furniture with\nwhich it was adorned; that furniture told her trade. Whether the root of\nsuperstition might be traced deeper still, and the woman and her traps\nwere really and directly connected with the powers beneath the earth, it\nis impossible to determine; it is certain she had the will, it is certain\nthat that will was from their inspiration; nay, it is certain that she\nthought she really possessed the communications which she desired; it is\ncertain, too, she so far deceived herself as to fancy that what she\nlearned by mere natural means came to her from a diabolical source. She\nkept up an active correspondence with Sicca. She was consulted by numbers;\nshe was up with the public news, the social gossip, and the private and\nsecret transactions of the hour; and had, before now, even interfered in\nmatters of state, and had been courted by rival political parties. But in\nthe high cares and occupations of this interesting person, we are not here\nconcerned; but with a conversation which took place between her and Juba,\nabout the same hour of the evening as that of C\u00c3\u00a6cilius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escape, but on\nthe day after it, while the sun was gleaming almost horizontally through\nthe tall trunks of the trees of the forest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my precious boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe choicest gifts of great\nCham be your portion! You had excellent sport yesterday, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll warrant. The\nrats squeaked, eh? and you beat the life out of them. That scoundrel\nsacristan, I suppose, has taken up his quarters below.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may say it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reptile! he turned right about, and\nwould have made himself an honest fellow, when it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be helped.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood, good!\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Gurta, as if she had got something very pleasant in\nher mouth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cah! that is good! but he did not escape on that score, I do\ntrust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey pulled him to pieces all the more cheerfully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPulled him to pieces, limb by limb, joint by joint, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Gurta.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid they skin him?\u00e2\u0080\u0094did they do anything to his eyes, or his tongue?\nAnyhow, it was too quickly, Juba. Slowly, leisurely, gradually. Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlike a glutton to be quick about it. Taste him, handle him, play with\nhim,\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s luxury! but to bolt him,\u00e2\u0080\u0094faugh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00c3\u00a6so\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slave made a good end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba: \u00e2\u0080\u009che stood up for his views, and\ndied like a man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gods smite him! but he has gone up\u00e2\u0080\u0094up:\u00e2\u0080\u009d and she laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUp to what\nthey call bliss and glory;\u00e2\u0080\u0094such glory! but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of our domain, you\nknow. But he did not die easy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe boys worried him a good deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite in\nmy line, mother, all this. I think you drink a pint of blood morning and\nevening, and thrive on it, old woman. It makes you merry; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too\nmuch for my stomach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa, ha, my boy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Gurta; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll improve in time, though you make\nwry faces, now that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re young. Well, and have you brought me any news\nfrom the capitol? Is any one getting a rise in the world, or a downfall?\nHow blows the wind? Are there changes in the camp? This Decius, I suspect,\nwill not last long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey all seem desperately frightened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009clest they should not\nsmite your friends hard enough, Gurta. Root and branch is the word.\nThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to make a few Christians for the occasion, in order to kill\nthem: and I almost think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, thoughtfully. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\nhave to show that they are not surpassed by the rabble. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a pity\nChristians are so few, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we must crush them, grind them, many or few:\nand we shall, we shall! Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see they are worse than other people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot at all,\nexcept that they are commonly sneaks. If Callista turns, why should not I\nturn too, mother, to keep her company, and keep your hand in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the witch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must serve _my_ master. You are\nhaving your fling just now, but you will buckle to in good time. You must\none day take some work with my merry men. Come here, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the fond\nmother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let me kiss you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep your kisses for your monkeys and goats and cats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not to my taste, old dame. Master! my master! I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a\nmaster! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never stand to be hired, nor cringe\nto a bully, nor quake before a rod. Please yourself, Gurta; I am a free\nman. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re my mother by courtesy only.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGurta looked at him savagely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to be pious and\nvirtuous, Juba? A choice saint you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make! You shall be drawn for a\npicture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I, if I choose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I must take service, willy\nnilly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d any day prefer the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to that of your friend. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve not\nleft the master to take the man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlaspheme not the great gods,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do you a\nmischief yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d insisted Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I must lick the earth, it shall not be\nwhere your friend has trod. It shall be in my brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fashion, rather\nthan in yours, Gurta.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she shrieked out with such disgust, that it is wonderful she\nuttered the name at all. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you have not told me about him, boy. Well,\nis he safe in the pit, or in the stomach of an hyena?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he has not got it in him to be a Christian.\nYes, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe with his uncle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! Jucundus must ruin him, debauch him, and then we must make away with\nhim. We must not be in a hurry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gurta, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit must be body and soul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one shall touch him, craven as he is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI despise him,\nbut let him alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come across me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gurta, sullenly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have my way. Why, you\nknow I could smite you to the dust, as well as him, if I chose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you have not asked me about Callista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is really a\ncapital joke, but she has got into prison for certain, for being a\nChristian. Fancy it! they caught her in the streets, and put her in the\nguard-house, and have had her up for examination. You see they want a\nChristian for the nonce: it would not do to have none such in prison; so\nthey will flourish with her till Decius bolts from the scene.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Furies have her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Gurta: \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe _is_ a Christian, my boy: I told\nyou so, long ago!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista a Christian!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009cha! ha! She and Agellius are going\nto make a match of it, of some sort or other. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking of other\nthings than paradise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe and the old priest, more likely, more likely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gurta. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in\nprison with her\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the pit, as I trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour master has cheated you for once, old woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba.\n\nGurta looked at him fiercely, and seemed waiting for his explanation. He\nbegan singing,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wheedled and coaxed, but he was no fool;\n  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be his own master, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d not be her tool;\n  Not the little black moor should send him to school.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe foamed and she cursed\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas the same thing to him;\n  She laid well her trap; but he carried his whim;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n  The priest scuffled off, safe in life and in limb.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGurta was almost suffocated with passion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCyprianus has not escaped,\nboy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked at length.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got him off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Juba, undauntedly.\n\nA shade, as of Erebus, passed over the witch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face; but she remained\nquite silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, I am my own master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must break your assumption\nof superiority. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a boy, though you call me so. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have my own\nway. Yes, I saved Cyprianus. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a bloodthirsty old hag! Yes, _I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve_\nseen your secret doings. Did not I catch you the other day, practising on\nthat little child? You had nailed him up by hands and feet against the\ntree, and were cutting him to pieces at your leisure, as he quivered and\nshrieked the while. You were examining or using his liver for some of your\nblack purposes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in my line; but you gloated over it; and when he\nwailed, you wailed in mimicry. You were panting with pleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGurta was still silent, and had an expression on her face, awful from the\nintensity of its malignity. She had uttered a low piercing whistle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Juba, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou revelled in it. You chattered to the poor babe\nwhen it screamed, as a nurse to an infant. You called it pretty names, and\nsqueaked out your satisfaction each time you stuck it. You old hag! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nnot of your breed, though they call us of kin. _I_ don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fear you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, observing the expression of her countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fear the\nimmortal devil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he continued his song\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe beckoned the moon, and the moon came down;\n  The green earth shrivelled beneath her frown;\n  But a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong will can keep his own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he was talking and singing, her call had been answered from the hut.\nAn animal of some wonderful species had crept out of it, and proceeded to\ncreep and crawl, moeing and twisting as it went, along the trees and\nshrubs which rounded the grass plot. When it came up to the old woman, it\ncrouched at her feet, and then rose up upon its hind legs and begged. She\ntook hold of the uncouth beast and began to fondle it in her arms,\nmuttering something in its ear. At length, when Juba stopped for a moment\nin his song, she suddenly flung it right at him, with great force, saying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then gave utterance to a low inward laugh, and leaned\nherself back against the trunk of the tree upon which she was sitting,\nwith her knees drawn up almost to her chin.\n\nThe blow seemed to act on Juba as a shock on his nervous system, both from\nits violence and its strangeness. He stood still for a moment, and then,\nwithout saying a word, he turned away, and walked slowly down the hill, as\nif in a maze. Then he sat down....\n\nIn an instant up he started again with a great cry, and began running at\nthe top of his speed. He thought he heard a voice speaking in him; and,\nhowever fast he ran, the voice, or whatever it was, kept up with him. He\nrushed through the underwood, trampling and crushing it under his feet,\nand scaring the birds and small game which lodged there. At last,\nexhausted, he stood still for breath, when he heard it say loudly and\ndeeply, as if speaking with his own organs, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot escape from\nyourself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then a terror seized him; he fell down and fainted away.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n                           A MOTHER\u00e2\u0080\u0099S BLESSING.\n\n\nWhen his senses returned, his first impression was of something in him not\nhimself. He felt it in his breathing; he tasted it in his mouth. The brook\nwhich ran by Gurta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s encampment had by this time become a streamlet,\nthough still shallow. He plunged into it; a feeling came upon him as if he\nought to drown himself, had it been deeper. He rolled about in it, in\nspite of its flinty and rocky bed. When he came out of it, his tunic\nsticking to him, he tore it off his shoulders, and let it hang round his\ngirdle in shreds, as it might. The shock of the water, however, acted as a\nsedative upon him, and the coolness of the night refreshed him. He walked\non for a while in silence.\n\nSuddenly the power within him began uttering, by means of his organs of\nspeech, the most fearful blasphemies, words embodying conceptions which,\nhad they come into his mind, he might indeed have borne with patience\nbefore this, or uttered in bravado, but which now filled him with\ninexpressible loathing, and a terror to which he had hitherto been quite a\nstranger. He had always in his heart believed in a God, but he now\nbelieved with a reality and intensity utterly new to him. He felt it as if\nhe saw Him; he felt there was a world of good and evil beings. He did not\nlove the good, or hate the evil; but he shrank from the one, and he was\nterrified at the other; and he felt himself carried away, against his\nwill, as the prey of some dreadful, mysterious power, which tyrannised\nover him.\n\nThe day had closed\u00e2\u0080\u0094the moon had risen. He plunged into the thickest wood,\nand the trees seemed to him to make way for him. Still they seemed to moan\nand to creak as they moved out of their place. Soon he began to see that\nthey were looking at him, and exulting over his misery. They, of an\ninferior nature, had had no gift which they could abuse and lose; and they\nremained in that honour and perfection in which they were created. Birds\nof the night flew out of them, reptiles slunk away; yet soon he began to\nbe surrounded, wherever he went, by a circle of owls, bats, ravens, crows,\nsnakes, wild cats, and apes, which were always looking at him, but somehow\nmade way, retreating before him, and yet forming again, and in order, as\nhe marched along.\n\nHe had passed through the wing of the forest which he had entered, and\npenetrated into the more mountainous country. He ascended the heights; he\nwas a taller, stronger man than he had been; he went forward with a\npreternatural vigour, and flourished his arms with the excitement of some\nvinous or gaseous intoxication. He heard the roar of the wild beasts\nechoed along the woody ravines which were cut into the solid mountain\nrock, with a reckless feeling, as if he could cope with them. As he passed\nthe dens of the lion, leopard, hyena, jackal, wild boar, and wolf, there\nhe saw them sitting at the entrance, or stopping suddenly as they prowled\nalong, and eyeing him, but not daring to approach. He strode along from\nrock to rock, and over precipices, with the certainty and ease of some\ngiant in Eastern fable. Suddenly a beast of prey came across him; in a\nmoment he had torn up by the roots the stump of a wild vine plant, which\nwas near him; had thrown himself upon his foe before it could act on the\naggressive, had flung it upon its back, forced the weapon into its mouth,\nand was stamping on its chest. He knocked the life out of the furious\nanimal; and crying \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d tore its flesh, and, applying his mouth to\nthe wound, sucked a draught of its blood.\n\nHe has passed over the mountain, and has descended its side. Bristling\nshrubs, swamps, precipitous banks, rushing torrents, are no obstacle to\nhis course. He has reached the brow of a hill, with a deep placid river at\nthe foot of it, just as the dawn begins to break. It is a lovely prospect,\nwhich every step he takes is becoming more definite and more various in\nthe daylight. Masses of oleander, of great beauty, with their red\nblossoms, fringed the river, and tracked out its course into the distance.\nThe bank of the hill below him, and on the right and left, was a maze of\nfruit-trees, about which nature, if it were not the hand of man, had had\nno thought except that they should be all together there. The wild olive,\nthe pomegranate, the citron, the date, the mulberry, the peach, the apple,\nand the walnut, formed a sort of spontaneous orchard. Across the water,\ngroves of palm-trees waved their long and graceful branches in the morning\nbreeze. The stately and solemn ilex, marshalled into long avenues, showed\nthe way to substantial granges or luxurious villas. The green turf or\ngrass was spread out beneath, and here and there flocks and herds were\nemerging out of the twilight, and growing distinct upon the eye. Elsewhere\nthe ground rose up into sudden eminences crowned with chestnut woods, or\nwith plantations of cedar and acacia, or wildernesses of the cork-tree,\nthe turpentine, the carooba, the white poplar, and the Phenician juniper,\nwhile overhead ascended the clinging tendrils of the hop, and an underwood\nof myrtle clothed their stems and roots. A profusion of wild flowers\ncarpeted the ground far and near.\n\nJuba stood and gazed till the sun rose opposite to him, envying, repining,\nhating, like Satan looking in upon Paradise. The wild mountains, or the\nlocust-smitten track would have better suited the tumult of his mind. It\nwould have been a relief to him to have retreated from so fair a scene,\nand to have retraced his steps, but he was not his own master, and was\nhurried on. Sorely against his determined strong resolve and will, crying\nout and protesting and shuddering, the youth was forced along into the\nfulness of beauty and blessing with which he was so little in tune. With\nrage and terror he recognised that he had no part in his own movements,\nbut was a mere slave. In spite of himself he must go forward and behold a\npeace and sweetness which witnessed against him. He dashed down through\nthe thick grass, plunged into the water, and without rest or respite began\na second course of aimless toil and travail through the day.\n\nThe savage dogs of the villages howled and fled from him as he passed by;\nbeasts of burden, on their way to market, which he overtook or met, stood\nstill, foamed and trembled; the bright birds, the blue jay and golden\noriole, hid themselves under the leaves and grass; the storks, a religious\nand domestic bird, stopped their sharp clattering note from the high tree\nor farmhouse turret, where they had placed their nests; the very reptiles\nskulked away from his shadow, as if it were poisonous. The boors who were\nat their labour in the fields suspended it, to look at one whom the Furies\nwere lashing and whirling on. Hour passed after hour, the sun attained its\nzenith, and then declined, but this dreadful compulsory race continued.\nOh, what would he have given for one five minutes of oblivion, of slumber,\nof relief from the burning thirst which now consumed him! but the master\nwithin him ruled his muscles and his joints, and the intense pain of\nweariness had no concomitant prostration of strength. Suddenly he began to\nlaugh hideously; and he went forward dancing and singing loud, and playing\nantics. He entered a hovel, made faces at the children, till one of them\nfell into convulsions, and he ran away with another; and when some country\npeople pursued him, he flung the child in their faces, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake\nthat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said he was Pentheus, king of Thebes, of whom he had never\nheard, about to solemnise the orgies of Bacchus, and he began to spout a\nchorus of Greek, a language he had never learnt or heard spoken.\n\nNow it is evening again, and he has come up to a village grove, where the\nrustics were holding a feast in honour of Pan. The hideous brutal god,\nwith yawning mouth, horned head, and goat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, was placed in a rude\nshed, and a slaughtered lamb, decked with flowers, lay at his feet. The\npeasants were frisking before him, boys and women, when they were startled\nby the sight of a gaunt, wild, mysterious figure, which began to dance\ntoo. He flung and capered about with such vigour that they ceased their\nsport to look on, half with awe and half as a diversion. Suddenly he began\nto groan and to shriek, as if contending with himself, and willing and not\nwilling some new act; and the struggle ended in his falling on his hands\nand knees, and crawling like a quadruped towards the idol. When he got\nnear, his attitude was still more servile; still groaning and shuddering,\nhe laid himself flat on the ground, and wriggled to the idol as a worm,\nand lapped up with his tongue the mingled blood and dust which lay about\nthe sacrifice. And then again, as if nature had successfully asserted her\nown dignity, he jumped up high in the air, and, falling on the god, broke\nhim to pieces, and scampered away out of pursuit, before the lookers-on\nrecovered from their surprise.\n\nAnother restless, fearful night amid the open country; ... but it seemed\nas if the worst had passed, and, though still under the heavy chastisement\nof his pride, there was now more in Juba of human action and of effectual\nwill. The day broke, and he found himself on the road to Sicca. The\nbeautiful outline of the city was right before him. He passed his\nbrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cottage and garden; it was a wreck. The trees torn up, the\nfences broken down, and the room pillaged of the little that could be\nfound there. He went on to the city, crying out \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius;\u00e2\u0080\u009d the gate was\nopen, and he entered. He went on to the Forum; he crossed to the house of\nJucundus; few people as yet were stirring in the place. He looked up at\nthe wall. Suddenly, by the help of projections, and other irregularities\nof the brickwork, he mounted up upon the flat roof, and dropped down along\nthe tiles, through the _impluvium_ into the middle of the house. He went\nsoftly into Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closet, where he was asleep, he roused him with the\nname of Callista, threw his tunic upon him, which was by his side, put his\nboots into his hands, and silently beckoned him to follow him. When he\nhesitated, he still whispered to him \u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and at length seized him\nand led him on. He unbarred the street door, and with a movement of his\narm, more like a blow than a farewell, thrust him into the street. Then he\nbarred again the door upon him, and lay down himself upon the bed which\nAgellius had left. His good Angel, we may suppose, had gained a point in\nhis favour, for he lay quiet, and fell into a heavy sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n                           CALLISTA IN DURANCE.\n\n\nWe will hope that the reader, as well as Agellius, is attracted by the\nword Callista, and wishes to know something about her fate; nay, perhaps\nfinds fault with us as having suffered him so long to content himself with\nthe chance and second-hand information which Jucundus or Juba has\nsupplied. If we have been wanting in due consideration for him, we now\ntrust to make up for it.\n\nWhen Callista, then, had so boldly left the cottage to stop the intruders,\nshe had in one important point reckoned without her host. She spoke Latin\nfluently, herself, and could converse with the townspeople, most of whom\ncould do the same; but it was otherwise with the inhabitants of the\ncountry, numbers of whom, as we have said, were in Sicca on the day of the\noutbreak. The two fellows, whom she went out to withstand, knew neither\nher nor the Latin tongue. They were of a race which called itself\nCanaanite, and really was so; huge, gigantic men, who looked like the sons\nof Enac, described in Holy Writ. They knew nothing of roads or fences, and\nhad scrambled up the hill as they could, the shortest way, and, being free\nfrom the crowd, with far more expedition than had they followed the beaten\ntrack. She and they could not understand each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech; but her\nappearance spoke for her, and, in consequence, they seized on her as their\nshare of the booty, and without more ado, carried her off towards Sicca.\nAs they came up by a route of their own, so they returned, and entered the\ncity by a gate more to the south, not the Septimian; a happy circumstance,\nas otherwise she would have stood every chance of being destroyed in that\nwholesale massacre which the soldiery inflicted on the crowd as it\nreturned.\n\nThese giants, then, got possession of Callista, and she entered Sicca upon\nthe shoulder of one of them, who danced in with no greater inconvenience\nthan if he was carrying on it a basket of flowers, or a box of millinery.\nHere the party met with the city police, who were stationed at the gate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDown with your live luggage, you rascals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said, in their harsh\nPunic; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat have you to do with plunder of this kind? and how came you by\nher?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those Christian rats, your worship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the fellow,\nwho, strong as he was, did not relish a contest with some dozen of armed\nmen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong live the Emperor! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach her to eat asses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heads another\ntime, and brew fevers. I found her with a party of Christians. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnothing but a witch, and she knows the consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet her go, you drunken animal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the constable, still keeping his\ndistance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never believe any woman is a Christian, let alone so young\na one. And now I look at her, so far as I can see by this light, I think\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s priestess of one of the great temples up there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe can turn herself into anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other of her capturers,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung or old. I saw her one night near Madaura, a month ago, in the tombs\nin the shape of a black cat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAway with you both, in the name of the Suffetes of Sicca and all the\nmagistracy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the official. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive up your prisoner to the authorities\nof the place, and let the law take its course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the Canaanites did not seem disposed to give her up, and neither party\nliking to attack the other, a compromise took place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nguardian of the night, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe law must be vindicated, and the peace\npreserved. My friends, you must submit to the magistrates. But since she\nhappens to be on your shoulder, my man, let her even remain there, and we\ndepute you, as a beast of burden, to carry her for us, thereby to save us\nthe trouble. Here, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re our prisoner; so you\nshall plead your own cause in the _popina_ there. Long live Decius, pious\nand fortunate! Long live this ancient city, colony and municipium! Cheer\nup, my lass, and sing us a stave or two, as we go; for I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pledge a\n_cyathus_ of unmixed, that, if you choose, you can warble notes as sweet\nas the manna gum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista was silent, but she was perfectly collected, and ready to avail\nherself of any opportunity to better her condition. They went on towards\nthe Forum, where a police-office, as we now speak, was situated, but did\nnot reach it without an adventure. The Roman military force at Sicca was\nnot more than a century of men; the greater number were at this moment at\nthe great gate, waiting for the mob; a few, in parties of three and four,\nwere patrolling the city. Several of these were at the entrance of the\nForum when the party came up to it; and it happened that a superior\nofficer, who was an assistant to what may be called the military president\nof the place, a young man, on whom much of the duty of the day had\ndevolved, was with the soldiers. She had known him as a friend of her\nbrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and recognised him in the gloom, and at once took advantage of\nthe meeting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgentlemen! help, Calphurnius! these rascals are\ncarrying me off to some den of their own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tribune at once knew her voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, with great\nastonishment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat, my pretty Greek! You most base, infamous, and\nunmannerly scoundrels, down with her this instant! What have you to do\nwith that young lady? You villains, unless you would have me crack your\nAfrican skulls with the hilt of my sword, down with her, I say!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was no resisting a Roman voice, but prompt obedience is a rarity,\nand the ruffians began to parley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy noble master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the constable,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our prisoner. Jove preserve you, and Bacchus and Ceres bless you,\nmy lord tribune! and long life to the Emperor Decius in these bad times.\nBut she is a rioter, my lord, one of the ringleaders, and a Christian and\na witch to boot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCease your vile gutturals, you animal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the officer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor I will ram\nthem down your throat with my pike to digest them. Put down the lady,\nbeast. Are you thinking twice about it? Go, Lucius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to a private,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ckick him away, and bring the woman here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista was surrendered, but the fellow, sullen at the usage he had met\nwith, and spiteful against Calphurnius, as the cause of it, cried out\nmaliciously, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMind what you are at, noble sir, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not our affair; you\ncan fry your own garlic. But an Emperor is an Emperor, and an Edict is an\nEdict, and a Christian is a Christian; and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what high places\nwill say to it, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your affair. Take notice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, as he\ngot to a safer distance, raising his voice still higher, that the soldiers\nmight hear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyon girl is a Christian priestess, caught in a Christian\nassembly, sacrificing asses and eating children for the overthrow of the\nEmperor, and the ruin of his loyal city of Sicca, and I have been\ninterrupted in the discharge of my duty\u00e2\u0080\u0094I, a constable of the place. See\nwhether Calphurnius will not bring again upon us the plague, the murrain,\nthe locusts, and all manner of _larv\u00c3\u00a6_ and _mani\u00c3\u00a6_ before the end of the\nstory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis speech perplexed Calphurnius, as it was intended. It was impossible\nhe could dispose of Callista as he wished, with such a charge formally\nuttered in the presence of his men. He knew how serious the question of\nChristianity was at that moment, and how determined the Imperial\nGovernment was on the eradication of its professors; he was a good\nsoldier, devoted to head-quarters, and had no wish to compromise himself\nwith his superiors, or to give bystanders an advantage over him, by\nsetting a prisoner at liberty without inquiry, who had been taken in a\nChristian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. He muttered an oath, and said to the soldiers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nmy lads, to the Triumviri with her, since it must be so. Cheer up, my star\nof the morning, bright beam of Hellas, it is only as a matter of form, and\nyou will be set at liberty as soon as they look on you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And with these\nwords he led the way to the _Officium_.\n\nBut the presiding genius of the _Officium_ was less accommodating than he\nhad anticipated. It might be that he was jealous of the soldiery, or of\ntheir particular interference, or indignant at the butchery at the great\ngate, of which the news had just come, or out of humour with the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwork, and especially with the Christians; at any rate, Calphurnius found\nhe had better have taken a bolder step, and have carried her as a prisoner\nto the camp. However, nothing was now left for him but to depart; and\nCallista fell again into the hands of the city, though of the superior\nfunctionaries, who procured her a lodging for the night, and settled to\nbring her up for examination next morning.\n\nThe morning came, and she was had up. What passed did not transpire; but\nthe issue was that she was remanded for a further hearing, and was told\nshe might send to her brother, and acquaint him where she was. He was\nallowed one interview with her, and he came away almost out of his senses,\nsaying she was bewitched, and fancied herself a Christian. What precisely\nshe had said to him, which gave this impression, he could hardly say; but\nit was plain there must be something wrong, or there would not be that\npublic process and formal examination which was fixed for the third day\nafterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n                          WHAT CAN IT ALL MEAN?\n\n\nWere the origin of Juba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s madness (or whatever the world would call it) of\na character which admitted of light writing about it, much might be said\non the surprise of the clear-headed, narrow-minded, positive, and\neasy-going Jucundus, when he found one nephew substituted for another, and\nhad to give over his wonder at Agellius, in order to commence a series of\nacts of amazement and consternation at Juba. He summoned Jupiter and Juno,\nBacchus, Ceres, Pomona, Neptune, Mercury, Minerva, and great Rome, to\nwitness the marvellous occurrence; and then he had recourse to the\ninfernal gods, Pluto and Proserpine, down to Cerberus, if he be one of\nthem; but, after all, there the portent was, in spite of all the deities\nwhich Olympus, or Arcadia, or Latium ever bred; and at length it had a\nnervous effect upon the old gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system, and, for the first evening\nafter it, he put all his good things from him, and went to bed supperless\nand songless. What had been Juba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motive in the exploit which so\nunpleasantly affected his uncle, it is of course quite impossible to say.\nWhether his mention of Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was intended to be for the benefit\nof her soul, or the ruin of Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, must be left in the obscurity in\nwhich the above narrative presents it to us; so far alone is certain,\nthough it does not seem to throw light on the question, that, on his\nleaving his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house in the course of the forenoon, which he did,\nwithout being pressed to stay, he was discovered prancing and\ngesticulating in the neighbourhood of Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prison, so as to excite\nthe attention of the _apparitor_, or constable, who guarded the entrance,\nand who, alarmed at his wildness, sent for some of his fellows, and, with\ntheir assistance, repelled the intruder, who, thereupon, scudding out at\nthe eastern gate, was soon lost in the passes of the mountain.\n\nTo one thing, however, we may pledge ourselves, that Juba had no intention\nof shaking, even for one evening, the nerves of Jucundus; yet shaken they\nwere till about the same time twenty-four hours afterwards. And when in\nthat depressed state, he saw nothing but misery on all sides of him. Juba\nwas lost; Agellius worse. Of course, he had joined himself to his sect,\nand he should never see him again; and how should he ever hold up his\nhead? Well, he only hoped Agellius would not be boiled in a caldron, or\nroasted at a slow fire. If this were done, he positively must leave Sicca,\nand the most thriving trade which any man had in the whole of the\nProconsulate. And then that little Callista! Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0094what a real calamity was\nthere! Anyhow he had lost her, and what should he do for a finisher of his\nfine work in marble, or metal? She was a treasure in herself. Altogether\nthe heavens were very dark; and it was scarcely possible for any one who\nknew well his jovial cast of countenance, to keep from laughing, whatever\nhis real sympathy, at the unusual length and blankness which were suddenly\nimposed upon it.\n\nWhile he sat thus at his shop window, which, as it were, framed him for\nthe contemplation of passers-by, on the day of the escape of Agellius, and\nthe day before Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public examination, Aristo rushed in upon him in\na state of far more passionate and more reasonable grief. He had called,\nindeed, the day before, but he found a pleasure in expending his distress\nupon others, and he came again to get rid of its insupportable weight by\ndischarging it in a torrent of tears and exclamations. However, at first\nthe words of both \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoved slow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the poet says, and went off in a sort\nof dropping fire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, in a depressed tone; \u00e2\u0080\u009che\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not come to _you_, of\ncourse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgellius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Agellius! No, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, after a pause, Aristo added,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should he be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I thought he might be. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been gone since early\nmorning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed! No, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where he is. How came he with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you yesterday; but you have forgotten. I was sheltering him; but\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad!\u00e2\u0080\u0094horribly mad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he slapped his hand against his\nthigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI always thought it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Aristo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you? Yes, so it is; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very different from what it ever was.\nThe furies have got hold of him with a vengeance! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frantic! Oh, if you\nhad seen him! Two boys, both mad! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all the father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to hear something about dear, sweet Callista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nher brother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I should indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Esculapius! they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all mad\ntogether!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it is like madness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Aristo, with great vehemence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going mad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus, who was picking up, since he\nbegan to talk, an exercise which was decidedly good for him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are _all_\ngoing mad! _I_ shall get crazed. The townspeople are crazed already. What\nan abominable, brutal piece of business was that three days ago! I put up\nmy shutters. Did it come near you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094all on account of one or two beggarly\nChristians, and my poor boy. What harm could two or three, toads and\nvipers though they be, do here? They might have been trodden down easily.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another thing at Carthage. Catch the ringleaders, I say; make\nexamples. The foxes escape, and our poor ganders suffer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAristo, pierced with his own misery, had no heart or head to enter into\nthe semi-political ideas of Jucundus, who continued,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no good. The empire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming to pieces, mark my words! I told\nyou so, if those beasts were let alone. They _have_ been let alone.\nRemedies are too late. Decius will do no good. No one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe! Farewell, my\nfriends! I am going. Like poor dear Callista, I shall be in prison, and,\nlike her, find myself dumb!... Ah! yes, Callista; how did you find her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO dear, sweet, suffering girl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried her brother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d meditatively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe _is_ a dear,\nsweet, suffering girl! I thought he might perhaps have taken her off\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\nwas my hope. He was so set upon hearing where she was, whether she could\nbe got out. It struck me he had made the best of his way to _her_. She\ncould do anything with him. And she loved him, she did!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced of\nit!\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing shall convince me otherwise! \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bring them together,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and they will rush into each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bewitched!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The\nwhole world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bewitched! Mark my words,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have an idea who is at the\nbottom of this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d groaned out Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not for top or bottom!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I care not for\nthe whole world, or for anything at all but Callista! If you could have\nseen the dear, patient sufferer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the poor fellow burst into a flood\nof tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBear up! bear up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, who by this time was considerably\nbetter; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshow yourself a man, my dear Aristo. These things must be;\u00e2\u0080\u0094they\nare the lot of human nature. You remember what the tragedian says: stay!\nno!\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the comedian,\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Menander\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Orcus and Erebus with all the tragedy and comedy that ever was\nspouted!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Aristo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you do nothing for me? Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you give me\na crumb of consolation or sympathy, encouragement or suggestion? I am a\nstranger in the country, and so is this dear sister of mine, whom I was so\nproud of; and who has been so good, and kind, and gentle, and sweet. She\nloved me so much, she never grudged me anything; she let me do just what I\nwould with her. Come here, go there,\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was just as I would. There we\nwere, two orphans together, ten years since, when I was double her age.\nShe wished to stay in Greece; but she came to this detestable Africa all\nfor me. She would be gay and bright when I would have her so. She had no\nwill of her own; and she set her heart upon nothing, and was pleased\nanywhere. She had not an enemy in the world. I protest she is worth all\nthe gods and goddesses that ever were hatched! And here, in this\nill-omened Africa, the evil eye has looked at her, and she thinks herself\na Christian, when she is just as much a hippogriff, or a chim\u00c3\u00a6ra.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but, Aristo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going to tell you who is at the\nbottom of it all. Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad; Agellius is mad; Juba is mad; and Strabo\nwas mad;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it was his wife, old Gurta, that drove him mad;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there, I\nthink, is the beginning of our troubles.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Come in! come in, Cornelius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncried, seeing his Roman friend outside, and relapsing for the moment into\nhis lugubrious tone; \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in, Cornelius, and give us some comfort, if you\ncan. Well, this is like a friend! I know if you can help me, you will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCornelius answered that he was going back to Carthage in a day or two, and\ncame to embrace him, and had hoped to have a parting supper before he\nwent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jucundus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut first tell me all about this\ndreadful affair; for you are in the secrets of the Capitol. Have they any\nclue what has become of my poor Agellius?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCornelius had not heard of the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troubles, and was full of\nconsternation at the news.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! Agellius really a Christian?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand at such a moment? Why,\nI thought you talked of some young lady who was to keep him in order?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Christian too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jucundus; and a silence ensued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nbad world!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imprisoned by the Triumviri. What will be\nthe end of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCornelius shook his head, and looked mysterious.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot anything so dreadful, I do trust,\nCornelius. Not the stake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCornelius still looked gloomy and pompous.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing in the way of torture?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot the rack, or the\npitchfork?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad business, on your own showing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius: \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad\nbusiness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you do nothing for us, Cornelius?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Aristo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe great people in\nCarthage are your friends. O Cornelius! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do anything for you!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be\nyour slave! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more a Christian than great Jove. She has nothing\nabout her of the cut;\u00e2\u0080\u0094not a shred of her garment, or a turn of her hair.\nShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Greek from head to foot\u00e2\u0080\u0094within and without. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as bright as the\nday! Ah! we have no friends here. Dear Callista! you will be lost because\nyou are a foreigner!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the passionate youth began to tear his hair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO\nCornelius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you can do anything for us! Oh! she shall\nsing and dance to you; she shall come and kneel down to you, and embrace\nyour knees, and kiss your feet, as I do, Cornelius!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he knelt down,\nand would have taken hold of Cornelius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beard.\n\nCornelius had never been addressed with so poetical a ceremonial, which\nnevertheless he received with awkwardness indeed, but with satisfaction.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear from you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said with pomposity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your sister is in prison\non suspicion of Christianity. The case is a simple one. Let her swear by\nthe genius of the Emperor, and she is free; let her refuse it, and the law\nmust take its course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he made a slight bow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but she is under a delusion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d persisted Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich cannot last\nlong. She says distinctly that she is _not_ a Christian, is not that\ndecisive? but then she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t burn incense; she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t swear by Rome. She\ntells me she does not _believe_ in Jupiter, nor I; can anything be more\nsenseless? It is the act of a mad woman. I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098My girl, the question is,\nAre you to be brought to shame? are you to die by the public sword? die in\ntorments?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Oh, I shall go mad as well as she!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he screamed out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was\nso clever, so witty, so sprightly, so imaginative, so versatile! why,\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do. She could model, paint, play on the lyre,\nsing, act. She could work with the needle, she could embroider. She made\nthis girdle for me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all that Agellius, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Agellius. I beg your\npardon, Jucundus; but it is;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he threw himself on the ground, and\nrolled in the dust.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been telling our young friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jucundus to Cornelius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nexert self-control, and to recollect Menander, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ne quid nimis.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Grieving\ndoes no good; but these young fellows, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no use at all speaking to\nthem. Do you think you could do anything for us, Cornelius?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Cornelius, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I have been here, I have fallen in with\na very sensible man, and a man of remarkably sound political opinions. He\nhas a great reputation, he is called Polemo, and is one of the professors\nat the Mercury. He seems to me to go to the root of these subjects, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised how well we agreed. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Greek, as well as this young\ngentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister. I should recommend him to go to Polemo; if any one\ncould disabuse her mind, it is he.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Aristo, starting up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, no, _you_ can do it better;\nyou have power with the government. The Proconsul will listen to you. The\nmagistrates here are afraid of _him_; _they_ don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish to touch the poor\ngirl, not they. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a noise everywhere, and so much ill\nblood, and so many spies and informers, and so much mistrust\u00e2\u0080\u0094but why\nshould it come upon _Callista_? Why should _she_ be a sacrifice? But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\noblige the Duumvirs as much as me in getting her out of the scrape. But\nwhat good would it do, if they _took_ her dear life? Only get us the\nrespite of a month; the delusion would vanish in a month. Get two months,\nif you can; or as long as you can, you know. Perhaps they would let us\nsteal out of the country, and no one the wiser; and no harm to any one. It\nwas a bad job our coming here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know nothing at Rome of feelings and intentions, and motives and\ndistinctions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cornelius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we know nothing of understandings,\nconnivances, and evasions. We go by facts; Rome goes by facts. The\nquestion is, What is the fact? Does she burn incense, or does she not?\nDoes she worship the ass, or does she not? However, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what can be\ndone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And so he went on, informing the pair of mourners that, as far as\nhis influence extended, he would do something in behalf both of Agellius\nand Callista.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n                            AM I A CHRISTIAN?\n\n\nThe sun had now descended for the last time before the solemn day which\nwas charged with the fate of Callista, and what was the state of mind of\none who excited such keen interest in the narrow circle within which she\nwas known? And how does it differ from what it was some weeks before, when\nAgellius last saw her? She would have been unable to say herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo is\nthe kingdom of God: as if a man should cast seed into the earth, and\nshould sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow\nup, whilst he knoweth not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She might, indeed, have been able afterwards,\non looking back, to say many things of herself; and she would have\nrecognised that while she was continually differing from herself, in that\nshe was changing, yet it was not a change which involved contrariety, but\none which expanded itself in (as it were) concentric circles, and only\nfulfilled, as time went on, the promise of its beginning. Every day, as it\ncame, was, so to say, the child of the preceding, the parent of that which\nfollowed; and the end to which she tended could not get beyond the aim\nwith which she set out. Yet, had she been asked, at the time of which we\nspeak, where was her principle and her consistency, what was her logic, or\nwhether she acted on reason, or on impulse, or on feeling, or in fancy, or\nin passion, she would have been reduced to silence. What did she know\nabout herself, but that, to her surprise, the more she thought over what\nshe heard of Christianity, the more she was drawn to it, and the more it\napproved itself to her whole soul, and the more it seemed to respond to\nall her needs and aspirations, and the more intimate was her presentiment\nthat it was true? The longer it remained on her mind as an object, the\nmore it seemed (unlike the mythology or the philosophy of her country, or\nthe political religion of Rome) to have an external reality and substance,\nwhich deprived objections to it of their power, and showed them to be at\nbest but difficulties and perplexities.\n\nBut then again, if she had been asked, what was Christianity, she would\nhave been puzzled to give an answer. She would have been able to mention\nsome particular truths which it taught, but neither to give them their\ndefinite and distinct shape, nor to describe the mode in which they were\nrealised. She would have said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe what has been told me, as from\nheaven, by Chione, Agellius, and C\u00c3\u00a6cilius:\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it was clear she could say\nnothing else. What the three told her in common and in concord was at once\nthe measure of her creed and the ground of her acceptance of it. It was\nthat wonderful unity of sentiment and belief in persons so dissimilar from\neach other, so distinct in their circumstances, so independent in their\ntestimony, which recommended to her the doctrine which they were so\nunanimous in teaching. She had long given up any belief in the religion of\nher country. As to philosophy, it dwelt only in conjecture and opinion;\nwhereas the very essence of religion was, as she felt, a recognition of\nthe worshippers on the part of the Object of it. Religion could not be\nwithout hope. To worship a being who did not speak to us, recognise us,\nlove us, was not religion. It might be a duty, it might be a merit; but\nher instinctive notion of religion was the soul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to a God who\nhad taken notice of the soul. It was loving intercourse, or it was a name.\nNow the three witnesses who had addressed her about Christianity had each\nof them made it to consist in the intimate Divine Presence in the heart.\nIt was the friendship or mutual love of person with person. Here was the\nvery teaching which already was so urgently demanded both by her reason\nand her heart, which she found nowhere else; which she found existing one\nand the same in a female slave, in a country youth, in a learned priest.\n\nThis was the broad impression which they made upon her mind. When she\nturned to consider more in detail what it was they taught, or what was\nimplied in that idea of religion which so much approved itself to her, she\nunderstood them to say that the Creator of heaven and earth, Almighty,\nAll-good, clothed in all the attributes which philosophy gives Him, the\nInfinite, had loved the soul of man so much, and her soul in particular,\nthat He had come upon earth in the form of a man, and in that form had\ngone through sufferings, in order to unite all souls to Him; that He\ndesired to love, and to be loved; that He had said so; that He had called\non man to love Him, and did actually bring to pass this loving intercourse\nof Him and man in those souls who surrendered themselves to Him. She did\nnot go much further than this; but as much as this was before her mind\nmorning, noon, and night. It pleaded in her; it importuned her; it would\nnot be rebuffed. It did not mind her moods, or disgusts, or doubts, or\ndenials, or dismissals, but came again and again. It rose before her, in\nspite of the contempt, reproach, and persecution which the profession of\nit involved. It smiled upon her; it made promises to her; it opened\neternal views to her; and it grew upon her convictions in clearness of\nperception, in congruity, and in persuasiveness.\n\nMoreover, the more she thought of Chione, of Agellius, and of C\u00c3\u00a6cilius the\nmore surely did she discern that this teaching wrought in them a something\nwhich she had not. They had about them a simplicity, a truthfulness, a\ndecision, an elevation, a calmness, and a sanctity to which she was a\nstranger, which spoke to her heart and absolutely overcame her. The image\nof C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, in particular, came out prominently and eloquently in her\nmemory,\u00e2\u0080\u0094not in his words so much as in his manner. In spite of what she\nhad injuriously said to him, she really felt drawn to worship him, as if\nhe were the shrine and the home of that Presence to which he bore such\nsolemn witness.\n\nO the change, when, as if in punishment for her wild words against him,\nshe found herself actually in the hands of lawless men, who were as far\nbelow her in sentiment as he was above her! O the change, when she was\ndizzied by their brutal vociferations and rapid motion, and that breath\nand atmosphere of evil which steamed up from the rankness of their\nimpiety! O the thankfulness which rose up in her heart, though but vaguely\ndirected to an object, when she found the repose and quiet, though it was\nthat of a prison! for young as she was, she had become tired of all things\nthat were seen, and had no strong desire, except for meditation on the\ngreat truths which she did not know.\n\nOne day passes and then another; and now the morning and the hour is come\nwhen she must appear before the magistrates of Sicca. With dread, with\nagitation, she looks forward to the moment. She has not yet a peace within\nher. Her peace is the stillness of the room in which she is imprisoned.\nShe knows it will pass away when she leaves it; she knows that again she\nmust be in the hands of cruel, godless men, with whom she has no sympathy;\nbut she has no stay whereon to lean in the terrible trial. Her brother\ncomes to her: he affects to forget her perverseness or delusion. He comes\nto her with a smile, and throws his arms around her; and Callista repels,\nfrom some indescribable feeling, his ardent caress, as if she were no\nlonger his. He has come to accompany her to court, by an indulgence which\nhe had obtained; to support her there,\u00e2\u0080\u0094to carry her through, and to take\nher back in triumph home. My sister,\u00e2\u0080\u0094why that strange, piteous look upon\nthy countenance?\u00e2\u0080\u0094why that paleness of thy cheek?\u00e2\u0080\u0094why that whisper of thy\nlips?\u00e2\u0080\u0094why those wistful, gentle pleadings of thine eyes? Sweet eyes, and\nbrow, and cheek, in which I have ever prided myself! Why so backward?\u00e2\u0080\u0094why\nso distant and unfriendly? Am I not come to rescue thee from a place where\nthou never shouldst have been?\u00e2\u0080\u0094where thou ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er shalt be again? Callista,\nwhat is this mystery?\u00e2\u0080\u0094speak!\n\nSuch as this was the mute expostulation conveyed in Aristo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look, and in\nthe fond grasp of his hand; while treading down forcibly within him his\nmemory and his fears of her great change, he determined she should be to\nhim still all that she had ever been. But how altered was that look, and\nhow relaxed that grasp, when at length her misery found words, and she\nsaid to him in agitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy time is short: I want some Christian, a\nChristian priest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was as though she had never shown any tendency before to the proscribed\nreligion. The words came to him with the intensity of something new and\nunimagined hitherto. He clasped his hands in emotion, turned white, and\ncould but say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista!\u00e2\u0080\u009d If she had made confession of the most heinous\nof crimes,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if she had spoken of murder, or some black treachery against\nhimself,\u00e2\u0080\u0094of some enormity too great for words, it might have been; but his\nsister!\u00e2\u0080\u0094his pride and delight, after all and certainly a Christian! Better\nfar had she said she was leaving him for ever, to abandon herself to the\ndegrading service of the temples; better had she said she had taken\nhemlock, or had an asp in her bosom, than that she should choose to go out\nof the world with the tortures, the ignominy, the malediction of the\nreligion of slaves.\n\nTime waits for no man, nor does the court of justice, nor the _subsellia_\nof the magistrate. The examination is to be held in the Basilica at the\nForum, and it requires from us a few words of explanation beforehand. The\nlocal magistrates then could only try the lesser offences, and decide\ncivil suits; cases of suspected Christianity were reserved for the Roman\nauthorities. Still, preliminary examinations were not unfrequently\nconducted by the city Duumvirs, or even in what may be called the police\ncourts. And this may have especially been the case in the Proconsulates.\nPropr\u00c3\u00a6tors and Presidents were in the appointment of the Emperor, and\njoined in their persons the supreme civil and military authority. Such\nprovinces, perhaps, were better administered; but there would be more of\narbitrariness in their rule, and it would not be so acceptable to the\nruled. The Proconsuls, on the other hand, were representatives of the\nSenate, and had not the military force directly in their hands. The\nnatural tendency of this arrangement was to create, on the one hand, a\nrivalry between the civil and military establishments; and, on the other,\nto create a friendly feeling between the Proconsul and the local\nmagistracy. Thus, not long before the date of this history, we read of\nGordian, the Proconsul, enjoying a remarkable popularity in his African\nprovince; and when the people rose against the exactions of the imperial\nProcurator, as referred to in a former page, they chose and supported\nGordian against him. But however this might be in general, so it was at\nthis time at Sicca, that the Proconsular _Officium_ and the city\nmagistrates were on a good understanding with each other, whereas there\nwas some collision between the latter and the military. Not much depends\nin the conduct of our story upon this circumstance; but it must be taken\nto account for the examination of Callista in the Forum, and for some\nother details which may follow before we come to the end of it.\n\nThe populace was collected about the gates and within the ample space of\nthe Basilica, but they gave expression to no strong feeling on the subject\nof a Christian delinquent. The famine, the sickness, and, above all, the\nlesson which they had received so lately from the soldiers, had both\ndiminished their numbers and cowed their spirit. They were sullen, too,\nand resentful; and, with the changeableness proverbial in a multitude, had\nrather have witnessed the beheading of a magistrate, or the burning of a\ntribune, than the torture and death of a dozen of wretched Christians.\nBesides, they had had a glut of Christian blood; a reaction of feeling had\ntaken place, and, in spite of the suspicion of witchcraft, the youth and\nthe beauty of Callista recommended her to their compassion.\n\nThe magistrates were seated on the _subsellia_, one of the Duumvirs\npresiding, in his white robe bordered with purple; his lictors, with\nstaves, not fasces, standing behind him. In the vestibule of the court, to\nconfront the prisoner on her first entrance, were the usual instruments of\ntorture. The charge was one which can only be compared, in the estimation\nof both state and people in that day, to that of witchcraft, poisoning,\nparricide, or other monstrous iniquity in Christian times. There were the\nheavy _boi\u00c3\u00a6_, a yoke for the neck, of iron, or of wood; the fetters; the\n_nervi_, or stocks, in which hands and feet were inserted, at distances\nfrom each other which strained or dislocated the joints. There, too, were\nthe _virg\u00c3\u00a6_, or rods with thorns in them; the _flagra_, _lori_, and\n_plumbati_, whips and thongs, cutting with iron or bruising with lead; the\nheavy clubs; the hook for digging into the flesh; the _ungula_, said to\nhave been a pair of scissors; the _scorpio_, and _pecten_, iron combs or\nrakes for tearing. And there was the wheel, fringed with spikes, on which\nthe culprit was stretched; and there was the fire ready lighted, with the\nwater hissing and groaning in the large caldrons which were placed upon\nit. Callista had lost for ever that noble intellectual composure of which\nwe have several times spoken; she shuddered at what she saw, and almost\nfainted, and, while waiting for her summons, leaned heavily against the\nmerciless _cornicularius_ at her side.\n\n\n\nAt length the judge began\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the servant from the _Officium_ stand\nforth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The _officialis_ answered that he had brought a prisoner charged\nwith Christianity; she had been brought to him by the military on the\nnight of the riot.\n\nThe _scriba_ then read out the deposition of one of the _stationarii_, to\nthe effect that he and his fellow-soldiers had received her from the hands\nof the civic force on the night in question, and had brought her to the\noffice of the Triumvirs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBring forward the prisoner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge; she was brought forward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere she is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the _officialis_, according to the prescribed\nform.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is your name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the judge.\n\nShe answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe judge then asked if she was a freewoman or a slave.\n\nShe answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFree; the daughter of Orsilochus, lapidary, of\nProconnesus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome conversation then went on among the magistrates as to her advocate or\n_defensor_. Aristo presented himself, but the question arose whether he\nwas _togatus_. He was known, however, to several magistrates, and was\nadmitted to stand by his sister.\n\nThen the _scriba_ read the charge\u00e2\u0080\u0094viz., that Callista was a Christian, and\nrefused to sacrifice to the gods.\n\nIt was a plain question of fact, which required neither witnesses nor\nspeeches. At a sign from the Duumvir in came two priests, bringing in\nbetween them the small altar of Jupiter; the charcoal was ready lighted,\nthe incense at the side, and the judge called to the prisoner to sprinkle\nit upon the flame for the good fortune of Decius and his son. All eyes\nwere turned upon her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a Christian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you so before. I have never been\nto a Christian place of worship, nor taken any Christian oath, nor joined\nin any Christian sacrifice. And I should lie did I say that I was in any\nsense a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a silence; then the judge said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cProve your words; there is the\naltar, the flame, and the incense; sacrifice to the genius of the\nEmperor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I do? I am not a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The judges looked at each\nother, as much as to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the old story; it is that inexplicable,\nhateful obstinacy, which will neither yield to reason, common sense,\nexpediency, or fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Duumvir only repeated the single word, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSacrifice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stopped awhile; then she came forward with a hurried step. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO my\nfate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy was I born? why am I in this strait? I have no god.\nWhat can I do? I am abandoned; why should I not do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She stopped; then\nshe went right on to the altar; she took the incense: suddenly she looked\nup to heaven and started, and threw it away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot! I dare not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried out. There was a great sensation in court. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvidently insane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nsome of the more merciful of the Decurions; \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor thing, poor thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her\nbrother ran up to her; talked to her, conjured her, fell down on his knees\nto her; took her hand violently, and would have forced her to offer. In\nvain; all he could get from her was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a Christian; indeed, I am\nnot a Christian. I have nothing to do with them. O the misery!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is mad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy lord judges, listen to me. She was seized\nby brutal ruffians during the riot, and the fright and shock have overcome\nher. Give her time, oh! give her time, and she will get right. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\ngood religious girl; she has done more work for the temples than any girl\nin Sicca; half the statues in the city are her finishing. Many of you, my\nlords, have her handiwork. She works with me. Do not add to my anguish in\nseeing her deranged, by punishing her as a criminal, a Christian: do not\ntake her from me. Sentence her, and you end the whole matter; give her a\nchance, and she will certainly be restored to the gods and to me. Will you\nput her to death because she is mad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat was to be done? The court was obsequious to the Proconsul, afraid of\nRome; jealous that the mob should have been more forward than the\nmagistracy. Had the city moved sooner, as soon as the edict came, there\nwould have been no rising, no riot. Already they had been called on for a\nreport about that riot and an explanation; if ever they had need to look\nsharp what they were doing, it was now. On the other hand, Callista and\nher brother had friends among the judges, as we have said, and their plea\nwas at once obvious and reasonable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she persists, she persists, and\nnothing can be said; we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish to be disloyal, or careless of the\nemperor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commands. If she is obstinate, she must die; but she dies quite\nas usefully to us, with quite as much effect, a month hence as now. Not\nthat we ask you to define a time on your own authority; simply do this,\nwrite to Carthage for advice. The government can answer within an hour, if\nit chooses. Merely say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Here is a young woman, who has ever been\nreligious and well conducted, of great accomplishments, and known\nespecially for her taste and skill in religious art, who since the day of\nthe riot has suddenly refused to take the test. She can give no reason for\nher refusal, and protests she is not a Christian. Her friends say that the\nfright has turned her brain, but that if kindly treated and kept quiet,\nshe will come round, and do all that is required of her. What are we to\ndo?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends prevailed. It was decided that the judges\nshould pass over this examination altogether, as if it had been rendered\ninformal by Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct. Had they recognised it as a proper legal\nprocess, they must have sentenced and executed her. Such a decision was of\nthis further advantage to her, that nothing was altered as to her place of\nconfinement. Instead of being handed over to the state prison, she\nremained in her former lodging, though in custody, and was allowed to see\nher friends. There had been very little chance of her recovery, supposing\nshe was mad, or of ever coming out, if she had once gone into the\nformidable _Carcer_. Meanwhile the magistrates sent to Carthage for\ninstructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\n                               A SICK CALL.\n\n\nAristo was not a fellow to have very long distresses; he never would have\ndied of love or of envy, for honour or for loss of property; but his\npresent calamity was one of the greatest he could ever have, and weighed\nupon him as long as ever any one could. His love for his sister was real,\nbut it would not do to look too closely into the grounds of it; if we are\nobliged to do so, we must confess to a suspicion that it lay rather in\ncertain outward, nay, accidental attributes of Callista, than in Callista\nherself. Did she lose her good looks, or her amiable unresisting\nsubmission to his wishes, whatever they were, she would also lose her hold\nupon his affections. This is not to make any severe charge against him,\nconsidering how it is with the common run of brothers and sisters,\nhusbands and wives; at the same time, most people certainly are haunted by\nthe memory of the past, and love for \u00e2\u0080\u009cAuld lang syne,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and this Aristo\nmight indeed have had, and perhaps had not. He loved chiefly for the\npresent, and by the hour.\n\nHowever, at the present time he was in a state of acute suffering, and,\nunder its paroxysm, he bethought him again of Cornelius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice, which he\nhad rejected, to betake himself to Polemo. He had a distant acquaintance\nwith him, sufficient for his purpose, and he called on him at the Mercury\nafter the latter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lecture. Polemo was no fool, though steeped in\naffectation and self-conceit, and Aristo fancied that his sister might be\nmore moved by a philosophical compatriot than any one else. Polemo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nastonishment, however, when the matter was proposed to him surpassed\nwords, and it showed how utterly Aristo was absorbed in his own misery,\nthat the possibility of such a reception should not have occurred to him.\nWhat, he, the friend of Plotinus, of Rogatian, and the other noble men and\nwomen who were his fellow-disciples at Rome; he, a member of the\nintellectual aristocracy of the metropolis of the world; what, he to visit\na felon in prison! and when he found the felon was a Christian, he fully\nthought that Aristo had come to insult him, and was on the point of\nbidding him leave him to himself. Aristo, however, persisted; and his\nevident anguish, and some particulars which came out, softened him.\nCallista was a Greek; a literate, or blue stocking. She had never indeed\nworn the philosophic pallium (as some Christian martyrs afterwards, if not\nbefore, have done\u00e2\u0080\u0094St. Catherine and St. Euphemia), but there was no reason\nwhy she should not do so. Polemo recollected having heard of her at the\nCapitol, and in the triclinium of one of the Decurions, as a lady of\nsingular genius and attainments; and he lately had made an attempt to form\na female class of hearers, and it would be a feather in his cap to make a\nconvert of her. So, not many days after, one evening, accompanied by\nAristo, he set out in his litter to the lodging where she was in custody;\nnot, however, without much misgiving when it came to the point, some\nshame, and a consequent visible awkwardness and stiffness in his manner.\nAll the perfumes he had about him could not hinder the disgust of such a\nvisit rising up into his nostrils.\n\nCallista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room was very well for a prison; it was on the ground-floor of\na house of many stories, close to the _Officium_ of the Triumvirate.\nThough not any longer under their strict jurisdiction, she was allowed to\nremain where she had first been lodged. She was in one of the rooms\nbelonging to an apparitor of that _Officium_, and, as he had a wife, or at\nleast a partner, to take care of her, she might consider herself very well\noff. However, the reader must recollect that we are in Africa, in the\nmonth of July, and our young Greek was little used to heats, which made\nthe whole city nothing less than one vast oven through the greater part of\nthe twenty-four hours. In lofty spacious apartments the resource adopted\nis to exclude the external air, and to live as Greenlanders, with closed\nwindows and doors; this was both impossible, and would have been\nunsuccessful, if attempted in the small apartment of Callista. But fever\nof mind is even worse than the heat of the sky; and it is undeniable that\nher health, and her strength, and her appearance are affected by both the\nphysical and the moral enemy. The beauty, which was her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delight,\nis waning away; and the shadows, if not the rudiments of a diviner\nloveliness, which is of expression, not of feature, which inspires not\nhuman passion, but diffuses chaste thoughts and aspirations, are taking\nits place. Aristo sees the change with no kind of satisfaction. The room\nhas a bench, two or three stools, and a bed of rushes in one corner. A\nstaple is firmly fixed in the wall; and an iron chain, light, however, and\nlong, if the two ideas can be reconciled, reaches to her slender arm, and\nis joined to it by an iron ring.\n\nOn Polemo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entering the room, his first exclamation was to complain of\nits closeness; but he had to do a work, so he began it without delay.\nCallista, on her part, started; she had no wish for his presence. She was\nreclining on her couch, and she sat up. She was not equal to a\ncontroversy, nor did she mean to have one, whatever might be the case with\n_him_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista, my life and joy, dear Callista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her brother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nbrought the greatest man in Sicca to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista cast upon him an earnest look, which soon subsided into\nindifference. He had a rose of Cyrene in his hand, whose perfume he\ndiffused about the small room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is Polemo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Aristo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe friend of the great Plotinus, who\nknows all philosophies and all philosophers. He has come out of kindness\nto you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista acknowledged his presence; it was certainly, she said, a great\nkindness for any one to visit her, and there.\n\nPolemo replied by a compliment; he said it was Socrates visiting Aspasia.\nThere had always been women above the standard of their sex, and they had\never held an intellectual converse with men of mind. He saw one such\nbefore him.\n\nCallista felt it would be plunging her soul still deeper into shadows,\nwhen she sought realities, if she must take part in such an argument. She\nremained silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour sister has not the fit upon her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Polemo of Aristo aside,\nneither liking her reception of him, nor knowing what to say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all,\ndear thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Aristo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is all attention for you to begin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNatives of Greece,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at length said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatives of Greece should know\neach other; they deserve to know each other; there is a secret sympathy\nbetween them. Like that mysterious influence which unites magnet to\nmagnet; or like the echo which is a repercussion of the original voice.\nSo, in like manner, Greeks are what none but they can be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he smelt at\nhis rose and bowed.\n\nShe smiled faintly when he mentioned Greece. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am fonder\nof Greece than of Africa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEach has its advantages,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polemo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a pleasure in imparting\nknowledge, in lighting flame from flame. It would be selfish did we not\nleave Greece to communicate what they have not here. But you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clady, neither can learn in Greece nor teach in Africa, while you are in\nthis vestibule of Orcus. I understand, however, it is your own choice; can\nthat be possible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I wish to get out, if I could, most learned Polemo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Callista\nsadly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay Polemo of Rhodes speak frankly to Callista of Proconnesus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked\nPolemo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not speak to every one. If so, let me ask, what keeps you\nhere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe magistrates of Sicca and this iron chain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Callista. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwould I could be elsewhere; I would I were not what I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat could you wish to be more than you are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Polemo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore\ngifted, accomplished, beautiful than any daughter of Africa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to the point, Polemo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, nervously, though respectfully;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe wants home-thrusts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see my brother wants you to ask how far it depends on me that I am\nhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Callista, wishing to hasten his movements; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is because I\nwill not burn incense upon the altar of Jupiter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA most insufficient reason, lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polemo.\n\nCallista was silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does that action mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polemo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit proposes to mean nothing\nelse than that you are loyal to the Roman power. You are not of those\nGreeks, I presume, who dream of a national insurrection at this time? then\nyou are loyal to Rome. Did I believe a Leonidas could now arise, an\nHarmodius, a Miltiades, a Themistocles, a Pericles, an Epaminondas, I\nshould be as ready to take the sword as another; but it is hopeless.\nGreece, then, makes no claim on you just now. Nor will I believe, though\nyou were to tell me so yourself, that you are leagued with any obscure,\nfanatic sect who desire Rome\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downfall. Consider what Rome is;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and now\nhe had got into the magnificent commonplace, out of his last panegyrical\noration with which he had primed himself before he set out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a\nGreek,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love Greece, but I love truth better; and I look at\nfacts. I grasp them, and I confess to them. The wide earth, through untold\ncenturies, has at length grown into the imperial dominion of One. It has\nconverged and coalesced in all its various parts into one Rome. This,\nwhich we see, is the last, the perfect state of human society. The course\nof things, the force of natural powers, as is well understood by all great\nlawyers and philosophers, cannot go further. Unity has come at length, and\nunity is eternity. It will be for ever, because it is a whole. The\nprinciple of dissolution is eliminated. We have reached the _apotelesma_\nof the world. Greece, Egypt, Assyria, Libya, Etruria, Lydia, have all had\ntheir share in the result. Each of them, in its own day, has striven in\nvain to stop the course of fate, and has been hurried onwards at its\nwheels as its victim or its instrument. And shall Jud\u00c3\u00a6a do what profound\nEgypt and subtle Greece have tried in vain? If even the freedom of\nthought, the liberal scepticism, nay, the revolutionary theories of Hellas\nhave proved unequal to the task of splitting up the Roman power, if the\npomp and luxury of the East have failed, shall the mysticism of Syria\nsucceed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, dear Callista, are you listening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Aristo, not over-confident\nof the fact, though Polemo looked round at him with astonishment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTen centuries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cten centuries have just been completed\nsince Rome began her victorious career. For ten centuries she has been\nfulfilling her high mission in the dispositions of Destiny, and perfecting\nher maxims of policy and rules of government. For ten centuries she has\npursued one track with an ever-growing intensity of zeal, and an\never-widening extent of territory. What can she not do? just one thing;\nand that one thing which she has not presumed to do, you are attempting.\nShe has maintained her own religion, as was fitting; but she has never\nthrown contempt on the religion of others. This you are doing. Observe,\nCallista, Rome herself, in spite of her great power, has yielded to that\nnecessity which is greater. She does not meddle with the religions of the\npeoples. She has opened no war against their diversities of rite. The\nconquering power found, especially in the East, innumerable traditions,\ncustoms, prejudices, principles, superstitions, matted together in one\nhopeless mass; she left them as they were; she recognised them; it would\nhave been the worse for her if she had done otherwise. All she said to the\npeoples, all she dared say to them, was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You bear with me, and I will\nbear with you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Yet this you will not do; you Christians, who have no\npretence to any territory, who are not even the smallest of the peoples,\nwho are not even a people at all, you have the fanaticism to denounce all\nother rites but your own, nay, the religion of great Rome. Who are you?\nupstarts and vagabonds of yesterday. Older religions than yours, more\nintellectual, more beautiful religions, which have had a position, and a\nhistory, and a political influence, have come to nought; and shall you\nprevail, you, a _congeries_, a hotch-potch of the leavings, and scraps,\nand broken meat of the great peoples of the East and West? Blush, blush,\nGrecian Callista, you with a glorious nationality of your own to go shares\nwith some hundred peasants, slaves, thieves, beggars, hucksters, tinkers,\ncobblers, and fishermen! A lady of high character, of brilliant\naccomplishments, to be the associate of the outcasts of society!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPolemo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech, though cumbrous, did execution, at least the termination\nof it, upon minds constituted like the Grecian. Aristo jumped up, swore an\noath, and looked round triumphantly at Callista, who felt its force also.\nAfter all, what did she know of Christians?\u00e2\u0080\u0094at best she was leaving the\nknown for the unknown: she was sure to be embracing certain evil for\ncontingent good. She said to herself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I never can be a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThen she said aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord Polemo, I am not a Christian;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never said I\nwas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is her absurdity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Aristo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is neither one thing nor the\nother. She won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Christian, and she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sacrifice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my misfortune,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know. I am losing both what I see, and\nwhat I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see. It is most inconsistent: yet what can I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPolemo had said what he considered enough. He was one of those who sold\nhis words. He had already been over-generous, and was disposed to give\naway no more.\n\nAfter a time, Callista said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolemo, do you believe in one God?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe in one eternal, self-existing\nsomething.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel that God within my heart. I feel myself in His\npresence. He says to me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do this: don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You may tell me that\nthis dictate is a mere law of my nature, as is to joy or to grieve. I\ncannot understand this. No, it is the echo of a person speaking to me.\nNothing shall persuade me that it does not ultimately proceed from a\nperson external to me. It carries with it its proof of its divine origin.\nMy nature feels towards it as towards a person. When I obey it, I feel a\nsatisfaction; when I disobey, a soreness\u00e2\u0080\u0094just like that which I feel in\npleasing or offending some revered friend. So you see, Polemo, I believe\nin what is more than a mere \u00e2\u0080\u0098something.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I believe in what is more real to\nme than sun, moon, stars, and the fair earth, and the voice of friends.\nYou will say, Who is He? Has He ever told you anything about Himself?\nAlas! no!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the more\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pity! But I will not give up what I have, because\nI have not more. An echo implies a voice; a voice a speaker. That speaker\nI love and I fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere she was exhausted, and overcome too, poor Callista! with her own\nemotions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO that I could find Him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed, passionately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the right hand\nand on the left I grope, but touch Him not. Why dost Thou fight against\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u0094why dost Thou scare and perplex me, O First and Only Fair? I have Thee\nnot, and I need Thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no Christian, you see, or I should\nhave found Him; or at least I should say I had found Him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is hopeless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Polemo to Aristo, in much disgust, and with some\nhauteur of manner: \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is too far gone. You should not have brought me to\nthis place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAristo groaned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cworship any but Him? Shall I say that He whom I\nsee not, whom I seek, is our Jupiter, or C\u00c3\u00a6sar, or the goddess Rome? They\nare none of them images of this inward guide of mine. I sacrifice to Him\nalone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two men looked at each other in amazement: one of them in anger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the demon of Socrates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aristo, timidly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will acknowledge C\u00c3\u00a6sar in every fitting way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will\nnot make him my God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPresently she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolemo, will not that invisible Monitor have\nsomething to say to all of us,\u00e2\u0080\u0094to you,\u00e2\u0080\u0094at some future day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpare me! spare me, Callista!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Polemo, starting up with a violence\nunsuited to his station and profession. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpare my ears, unhappy\nwoman!\u00e2\u0080\u0094such words have never hitherto entered them. I did not come to be\ninsulted. Poor, blind, hapless, perverse spirit\u00e2\u0080\u0094I separate myself from you\nfor ever! Desert, if you will, the majestic, bright, beneficent traditions\nof your forefathers, and live in this frightful superstition! Farewell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not seem better pleased with Aristo than with Callista, though\nAristo helped him into his litter, walked by his side, and did what he\ncould to propitiate him.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\n                               CONVERSION.\n\n\nIf there is a state of mind utterly forlorn, it is that in which we left\nthe poor prisoner after Polemo had departed. She was neither a Christian,\nnor was she not. She was in the midway region of inquiry, which as surely\ntakes time to pass over, except there be some almost miraculous\ninterference, as it takes time to walk from place to place. You see a\nperson coming towards you, and you say, impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come\nfaster?\u00e2\u0080\u0094why are you not here already?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0094because it takes time. To see\nthat heathenism is false,\u00e2\u0080\u0094to see that Christianity is true,\u00e2\u0080\u0094are two acts,\nand involve two processes. They may indeed be united, and the truth may\nsupplant the error; but they may not. Callista obeyed, as far as truth was\nbrought home to her. She saw the vanity of idols before she had faith in\nHim who came to destroy them. She could safely say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI discard Jupiter:\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe could not say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Besides, what did she know of\nChristians? How did she know that they would admit her, if she wished it?\nThey were a secret society, with an election, an initiation, and\noaths;\u00e2\u0080\u0094not a mere philosophical school, or a profession of opinion, open\nto any individual. If they were the good people that she fancied them to\nbe,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if they were not, she would not think of them at all,\u00e2\u0080\u0094they were\nnot likely to accept of her.\n\nStill, though we may account for her conduct, its issue was not, on that\naccount, the less painful. She had neither the promise of this world, nor\nof the next, and was losing earth without gaining heaven. Our Lord is\nreported to have said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe ye good money-changers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Poor Callista did not\nknow how to turn herself to account. It had been so all through her short\nlife. She had ardent affections, and keen sensibilities, and high\naspirations; but she was not fortunate in the application of them. She had\nput herself into her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, and had let him direct her course.\nIt could not be expected that he would be very different from the world.\nWe are cautioned against \u00e2\u0080\u009crejoicing in our youth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Aristo rejoiced in his\nwithout restraint; and he made his sister rejoice in hers, if enjoyment it\nwas. He himself found in the pleasures he pointed out a banquet of\nfruits:\u00e2\u0080\u0094she dust and ashes. And so she went on; not changing her life,\nfrom habit, from the captivity of nature, but weary, disappointed,\nfastidious, hungry, yet not knowing what she would have; yearning after\nsomething, she did not well know what. And as heretofore she had cast her\nlot with the world, yet had received no price for her adhesion, so now she\nhad bid it farewell; yet had nothing to take in its place.\n\nAs to her brother, after the visit of Polemo, he got more and more\nannoyed\u00e2\u0080\u0094angry rather than distressed, and angry with her. One more\nopportunity occurred of her release, and it was the last effort he made to\nmove her. Cornelius, in spite of his pomposity, had acted the part of a\nreal friend. He wrote from Carthage, that he had happily succeeded in his\napplication to government, and, difficult and unusual as was the grace,\nhad obtained her release. He sent the formal documents for carrying it\nthrough the court, and gained the eager benediction of the excitable\nAristo. He rushed with the parchments to the magistrates, who recognised\nthem as sufficient, and got an order for admission to her room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJoy, my dearest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are free! We will leave this loathsome\ncountry by the first vessel. I have seen the magistrates already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe colour came into her wan face, she clasped her hands together, and\nlooked earnestly at Aristo. He proceeded to explain the process of\nliberation. She would not be called on to sacrifice, but must sign a\nwriting to the effect that she had done so, and there would be an end of\nthe whole matter. On the first statement she saw no difficulty in the\nproposal, and started up in animation. Presently her countenance fell; how\ncould she say that she had done what it was treason to her inward Guide to\ndo? What was the difference between acknowledging a blasphemy by a\nsignature or by incense? She smiled sorrowfully at him, shook her head,\nand lay down again upon her rushes. She had anticipated the Church\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\njudgment on the case of the _Libellatici_.\n\nAristo could not at first believe he heard aright, that she refused to be\nsaved by what seemed to him a matter of legal form; and his anger grew so\nhigh as to eclipse and to shake his affection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLost girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nabandon you to the Furies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he shook his clenched hand at her. He\nturned away, and said he would never see her again, and he kept his word.\nHe never came again. He took refuge, with less restraint than was usual to\nhim, in such pleasures as the city could supply, and strove to drive his\nsister from his mind by dissipation. He mixed in the games of the Campus\nMartius under the shadow of the mountain; took part with the revellers in\nthe Forum, and ended the evening at the Therm\u00c3\u00a6. Sometimes the image of\ndear Callista, as once she looked, would rush into his mind with a force\nwhich would not be denied, and he would weep for a whole night.\n\nAt length he determined to destroy himself, after the example of so many\ngreat men. He gave a sumptuous entertainment, expending his means upon it,\nand invited his friends to partake of it. It passed off with great gaiety;\nnothing was wanting to make it equal to an occasion so special and\nsingular. He disclosed to his guests his purpose, and they applauded; the\nlast libations were made\u00e2\u0080\u0094the revellers departed\u00e2\u0080\u0094the lights were\nextinguished. Aristo disappeared that night: Sicca never saw him again.\nAfter some time it was found that he was at Carthage, and he had been\nprovident enough to take with him some of his best working tools, and some\nspecimens of his own and poor Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skill.\n\nStrange to say, Jucundus proved a truer friend to the poor girl than her\nbrother. In spite of his selfishness and hatred of Christians, he was\nconsiderably affected as her case got more and more serious, and it became\nevident that only one answer could be returned to the magistrates from\nCarthage. He was quite easy about Agellius, who had, as he considered,\nsuccessfully made off with himself, and he was reconciled to the thought\nof never seeing him again. Had it not been for this, one might have\nfancied that some lurking anxiety about the fate of his nephew might have\nkept alive the fidget which Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismal situation gave him, for the\nphilosopher tells us, that pity always has something in it of self; but,\nunder the circumstances, it would be rash judgment to have any such\nsuspicion of his motives. He was not a cruel man: even the \u00e2\u0080\u009choary-headed\nFabian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Cyprian, or others whom he so roundly abused, would have\nfound, when it came to the point, that his bluster was his worst weapon\nagainst them; at any rate he had enough of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilk of human kindness\u00e2\u0080\u009d to\nfeel considerable distress about that idiotic Callista.\n\nYet what could he do? He might as well stop the passage of the sun, as the\nmovements of mighty Rome, and a rescript would be coming to a certainty in\ndue time from Carthage, and would just say one thing, which would\nforthwith be passing into the region of fact. He had no one to consult,\nand to tell the truth, Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate was more than acquiesced in by the\npublic of Sicca. Her death seemed a solution of various perplexities and\ntroubles into which the edict had brought them; it would be purchasing the\npraise of loyalty cheaply. Moreover, there were sets of men actually\nhostile to her and her brother; the companies of statuaries, lapidaries,\nand goldsmiths, were jealous of foreign artists like them, who showed\ncontempt for Africa, and who were acquainted, or rather intimate, with\nmany of the higher classes, and even high personages in the place. Well,\nbut could not some of those great people help her now? His mind glanced\ntowards Calphurnius, whom he had heard of as in some way or other\nprotecting her on the evening of the riot, and to him he determined to\nbetake himself.\n\nCalphurnius and the soldiery were still in high dudgeon with the populace\nof Sicca, displeased with the magistrates, and full of sympathy for\nCallista. Jucundus opened his mind fully to the tribune, and persuaded him\nto take him to Septimius, his military superior, and in the presence of\nthe latter many good words were uttered both by Calphurnius and Jucundus.\nJucundus gave it as his opinion that it was a very great mistake to strike\nat any but the leaders of the Christian sect; he quoted the story of King\nTarquin and the poppies, and assured the great man that it was what he had\nalways said and always prophesied, and that, depend upon it, it was a\ngreat mistake not to catch Cyprianus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe strong arm of the law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould not, on the other hand, be\nput forth against such butterflies as this Callista, a girl who, he knew\nfrom her brother, had not yet seen eighteen summers. What harm could such\na poor helpless thing possibly do? She could not even defend herself, much\nless attack anybody else. No,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour proper policy with\nthese absurd people is a smiling face and an open hand. Recollect the\nfable of the sun and the wind; which made the traveller lay aside his\ncloak? Do you fall in with some sour-visaged, stiff-backed worshipper of\nthe Furies? fill his cup for him, crown his head with flowers, bring in\nthe flute-women. Observe him\u00e2\u0080\u0094he relaxes; a smile spreads on his\ncountenance; he laughs at a jest; \u00e2\u0080\u0098captus est; habet:\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he pours a\nlibation. Great Jove has conquered! he is loyal to Rome; what can you\ndesire more? But beat him, kick him, starve him, turn him out of doors;\nand you have a natural enemy to do you a mischief whenever he can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCalphurnius took his own line, and a simple one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was some vile\nslave or scoundrel African,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno harm would have been done; but,\nby Jupiter Tonans, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Greek girl, who sings like a Muse, dances like a\nGrace, and spouts verses like Minerva. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twould be sacrilege to touch a\nhair of her head; and we forsooth are to let these cowardly dogs of\nmagistrates entrap Fortunianus at Carthage into this solecism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeptimius said nothing, as became a man in office; but he came to an\nunderstanding with his visitors. It was plain that the Duumvirs of Sicca\nhad no legal custody of Callista; in a criminal matter she might seem to\nfall under the jurisdiction of the military; and Calphurnius gained leave\nto claim his right at the proper moment. The rest of his plan the tribune\nkept to himself, nor did Septimius wish to know it. He intended to march a\nguard into the prison shortly before Callista was brought out for\nexecution, and then to make it believed that she had died under the\nhorrors of the Barathrum. The corpse of another woman could without\ndifficulty be found to be her representative, and she herself would be\ncarried off to the camp.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, to return to the prisoner herself, what was the consolation,\nwhat the occupation of Callista in this waiting time, ere the Proconsul\nhad sent his answer? Strange to say, and, we suppose, from a sinful\nwaywardness in her, she had, up to this moment, neglected to avail herself\nof a treasure, which by a rare favour had been put into her possession. A\nsmall parchment, carefully written, elaborately adorned, lay in her bosom,\nwhich might already have been the remedy of many a perplexity, many a woe.\nIt is difficult to say under what feelings she had been reluctant to open\nthe Holy Gospel, which C\u00c3\u00a6cilius had intrusted to her care. Whether she was\nso low and despondent that she could not make the effort, or whether she\nfeared to convince herself further, or whether she professed to be waiting\nfor some calmer time, as if that were possible, or whether her\nunwillingness was that which makes sick people so averse to eating, or to\nremedies which they know would be useful to them, cannot well be\ndetermined; but there are many of us who may be able, from parallel\ninstances of infirmity, to enter into that state of mind, which led her at\nleast to procrastinate what she might do any minute. However, now left\nabsolutely to herself, Aristo gone, and the answer of the government to\nthe magistracy not having yet come, she recurred to the parchment, and to\nthe Bishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, which ran, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere you will see who it is we love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\nlanguage to that effect. It was tightly lodged under her girdle, and so\nhad escaped in the confusion of that terrible evening. She opened it at\nlength and read.\n\nIt was the writing of a provincial Greek; elegant, however, and marked\nwith that simplicity which was to her taste the elementary idea of a\nclassic author. It was addressed to one Theophilus, and professed to be a\ncarefully digested and verified account of events which had been already\nattempted by others. She read a few paragraphs, and became interested, and\nin no long time she was absorbed in the volume. When she had once taken it\nup, she did not lay it down. Even at other times she would have prized it,\nbut now, when she was so desolate and lonely, it was simply a gift from an\nunseen world. It opened a view of a new state and community of beings,\nwhich only seemed too beautiful to be possible. But not into a new state\nof things alone, but into the presence of One who was simply distinct and\nremoved from anything that she had, in her most imaginative moments, ever\ndepicted to her mind as ideal perfection. Here was that to which her\nintellect tended, though that intellect could not frame it. It could\napprove and acknowledge, when set before it, what it could not originate.\nHere was He who spoke to her in her conscience; whose Voice she heard,\nwhose Person she was seeking for. Here was He who kindled a warmth on the\ncheek of both Chione and Agellius. That image sank deep into her; she felt\nit to be a reality. She said to herself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is no poet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dream; it is\nthe delineation of a real individual. There is too much truth and nature,\nand life and exactness about it, to be anything else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet she shrank from\nit; it made her feel her own difference from it, and a feeling of\nhumiliation came upon her mind, such as she never had had before. She\nbegan to despise herself more thoroughly day by day; yet she recollected\nvarious passages in the history which reassured her amid her\nself-abasement, especially that of His tenderness and love for the poor\ngirl at the feast, who would anoint His feet; and the full tears stood in\nher eyes, and she fancied she was that sinful child, and that He did not\nrepel her.\n\nO what a new world of thought she had entered! it occupied her mind from\nits very novelty. Everything looked dull and dim by the side of it; her\nbrother had ever been dinning into her ears that maxim of the heathen,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnjoy the present, trust nothing to the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She indeed could not\nenjoy the present with that relish which he wished, and she had not any\ntrust in the future either; but this volume spoke a different doctrine.\nThere she learned the very opposite to what Aristo taught\u00e2\u0080\u0094viz., that the\npresent must be sacrificed for the future; that what is seen must give way\nto what is believed. Nay, more, she drank in the teaching which at first\nseemed so paradoxical, that even present happiness and present greatness\nlie in relinquishing what at first sight seems to promise them; that the\nway to true pleasure is, not through self-indulgence, but through\nmortification; that the way to power is weakness, the way to success\nfailure, the way to wisdom foolishness, the way to glory dishonour. She\nsaw that there was a higher beauty than that which the order and harmony\nof the natural world revealed, and a deeper peace and calm than that which\nthe exercise, whether of the intellect or of the purest human affection,\ncan supply. She now began to understand that strange, unearthly composure,\nwhich had struck her in Chione, Agellius, and C\u00c3\u00a6cilius; she understood\nthat they were detached from the world, not because they had not the\npossession, nor the natural love of its gifts, but because they possessed\na higher blessing already, which they loved above everything else. Thus,\nby degrees, Callista came to walk by a new philosophy; and had ideas, and\nprinciples, and a sense of relations and aims, and a susceptibility of\narguments, to which before she was an utter stranger. Life and death,\naction and suffering, fortunes and abilities, all had now a new meaning\nand application. As the skies speak differently to the philosopher and the\npeasant, as a book of poems to the imaginative and to the cold and narrow\nintellect, so now she saw her being, her history, her present condition,\nher future, in a new light, which no one else could share with her. But\nthe ruling sovereign thought of the whole was He, who exemplified all this\nwonderful philosophy in Himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XXX.\n\n\n                              TORRES VEDRAS.\n\n\nThere were those, however, whom Callista could understand, and who could\nunderstand her; there were those who, while Aristo, Cornelius, Jucundus,\nand Polemo were moving in her behalf, were interesting themselves also in\nher, and in a more effectual way. Agellius had joined C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, and, if in\nno other way, by his mouth came to the latter and his companions the news\nof her imprisonment. On the morning that Agellius had been so strangely\nlet out of confinement by his brother, and found himself seated at the\nstreet-door, with his tunic on his arm and his boots on the ground before\nhim, his first business was to recollect where he was, and to dispose of\nthose articles of dress according to their respective uses. What should he\ndo with himself, was of course his second thought. He could not stay there\nlong without encountering the early risers of Sicca, the gates being\nalready open. To attempt to find out where Callista was, and then to see\nher or rescue her, would have ended at once in his own capture. To go to\nhis own farm would have been nearly as dangerous, and would have had less\nmeaning. C\u00c3\u00a6cilius too had said, that they were not long to be separated,\nand had given him directions for finding him.\n\nImmediately then he made his way to one of the eastern gates, which led to\nThibursicumbur. There was indeed no time to be lost, as he soon had\nindications; he met several men who knew him by sight, and one of the\napparitors of the Duumviri, who happily did not. An apostate Christian,\nwhose zeal for the government was notorious, passed him and looked back\nafter him. However, he would soon be out of pursuit, if he had the start\nof them until the sun got round the mountains he was seeking. He walked on\nthrough a series of rocky and barren hills, till he got some way past the\nsecond milestone. Before he had reached the third he had entered a defile\nin the mountains. Perpendicular rocks rose on each side of him, and the\nlevel road, reaching from rock to rock, was not above thirty feet across.\nHe felt that if he was pursued here, there was no escape. The third\nmilestone passed, he came to the country road; he pursued it, counting out\nhis thousand steps, as C\u00c3\u00a6cilius had instructed him. By this time it had\nleft the stony bottom, and was rising up the side of the precipice.\nBrushwood and dwarf pines covered it, mingled with a few olives and\ncaroubas. He said out his seven pater nosters as he walked, and then\nlooked around. He had just passed a goatherd, and they looked hard at each\nother. Agellius wished him good morning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are wishing a kid for Bacchus, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man to him as he was\nrunning his eye over the goats. On Agellius answering in the negative, he\nsaid in a clownish way, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe who does not sacrifice to Bacchus does not\nsacrifice goats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius, bearing in mind C\u00c3\u00a6cilius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directions, saw of course there was\nsomething in the words which did not meet the ear, and answered\ncarelessly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe who does not sacrifice, does not sacrifice to Bacchus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut perhaps you prefer a lamb for a sacrifice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is the right one; but the one I mean was slain\nlong since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe man, without any change of manner, went on to say that there was an\nacquaintance of his not far up the rock, who could perhaps satisfy him on\nthe point. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow those wild olives, though the path seems\nbroken, and you will come to him at the nineteenth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgellius set out, and never was path so untrue to its own threats. It\nseemed ending in abrupt cliffs every turn, but never fulfilled the\nanticipation; that is, while he kept to the olive-trees. After ascending\nwhat was rather a flight of marble steps, washed and polished by the\nwinter torrents, than a series of crags, he fulfilled the number of trees,\nand looked round at the man sitting under it. O the joy and surprise! it\nwas his old servant Aspar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are safe, then, Aspar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I find you here. O what a\ntender Providence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have taken my stand here, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Aspar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cday after day,\nsince I got here, in hopes of seeing you. I could not get back to you from\nJucundus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that dreadful morning, and so I made my way here. Your uncle\nsent for you in my presence, but at the time I did not know what it meant.\nI was able to escape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now for C\u00c3\u00a6cilius,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Agellius.\n\nBehind the olive-tree a torrent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed descended; the descent being so\neasy, and yet so natural, that art had evidently interfered with nature,\nyet concealed its interference. After tracing it some yards, they came to\na chasm on the opposite side; and, passing through it, Agellius soon found\nhimself, to his surprise, on a bleak open hill, to which the huge mountain\nformed merely a sort of _fa\u00c3\u00a7ade_. Its surface was half rock, half moor,\nand it was surrounded by precipices. It was such a place as some hermit of\nthe middle ages might have chosen for his solitude. The two walked briskly\nacross it, and at length came to a low, broad yawning opening, branching\nout into several passages which, if pursued, would have been found to end\nin nothing. Aspar, however, made straight for what appeared a dead wall of\nrock, in which, on his making a signal, a door, skilfully hidden, was\nopened from within, and was shut behind them by the porter. They now stood\nin a gallery running into the mountain. It was very long, and a stream of\ncold air came along it. Aspar told him that at the extremity of it they\nshould find C\u00c3\u00a6cilius.\n\nAgellius was indeed in the vestibule of a remarkable specimen of those\ncaves which had been used for religious purposes, first by the aborigines\nof the country, then by the Ph\u00c5\u0093nician colonists, and in the centuries\nwhich had just passed, for the concealment of the Christians. The passage\nalong which they were proceeding might itself be fitly called a cave, but\nstill it was only one of several natural subterraneans, of different\nshapes, and opening into each other. Some of them lay along the face of a\nravine, from which they received light and air; and here in one place\nthere were indications of a fortified front. They were perfectly dry,\nthough the water had at some remote period filtered through the roof, and\nhad formed pendants and pillars of semi-transparent stalactite, of great\nbeauty. It was another and singular advantage that a particular spot in\none of the caverns, which bordered on the ravine, was the focus of an\nimmense ear or whispering-gallery, such, that whatever took place in the\npublic road in which the ravine terminated, could be distinctly heard\nthere, and thus they were always kept on guard against the attack of an\nenemy, if expected. Had either Agellius or Aspar been curious about such a\nmatter, the latter might have pointed out the place where a Punic altar\nonce had been discovered, with a sort of _tumulus_ of bones of mice near\nat hand, that animal coming into the list of victims in the Ph\u00c5\u0093nician\nworship.\n\nBut the two Christians were engaged, as they first halted, and then walked\nalong the corridor, in other thoughts, than in asking and answering\nquestions about the history of the place of refuge in which they found\nthemselves. We have already remarked on the central position of Sicca for\nthe purpose of missionary work and of retreat in persecution; such a\ndwelling in the rocks did but increase its advantageousness, and in\nconsequence at this moment many Christians had availed themselves of it.\nIt is an English proverb that three removes are as bad as a fire; and so\ngreat were the perils and the hardships of flight in those times, that it\nwas a question, in a merely earthly point of view, whether the risk of\nbeing apprehended at home was not a far less evil than the evils which\nwere certain upon leaving it. There was nothing, then, ungenerous in the\necclesiastical rule that they alone should flee, in persecution, who were\nmarked out for death, if they stayed. The laity, private families, and the\npriests, on whose ministrations they depended, remained; bishops, deacons,\nand what may be called the staff of the episcopate, notaries, messengers,\nseminarists, and ascetics, would disappear from the scene of persecution.\n\nAgellius learned from his slave that the cave had been known to him from\nthe time he was a boy, and that it was one of the secrets which all who\nshared it religiously observed. Holy men, it seemed, had had intimations\nof the present trial for several years past; and it was the full\npersuasion of the heads of the Church, that, though it might blow over for\na short time, it would recur at intervals for many years, ending in a\nvisitation so heavy and long, that the times of Antichrist would seem to\nhave arrived. However, the impression upon their minds was, that then\nwould come a millennium, or, in some sort, a reign of the saints upon the\nearth. That, however, was a date which even Agellius himself, young as he\nwas, would not be likely to reach; indeed, who could expect to escape, who\nmight not hope to gain, a Martyr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, in the interval, in the series\nof assaults, between which Christianity had to run the gauntlet? Aspar\nsaid, moreover, that some martyrs lay in the chapels within, and that\nvarious confessors had ended their days there. At the present time there\nwere representatives, there collected, of a large portion of the Churches\nof the Proconsulate. A post, so to call it, went between them and Carthage\nevery week, and his friend and father, the bishop of that city, was\nespecially busy in correspondence.\n\nMoreover, Agellius learned from him that they had many partisans,\nwell-wishers, and sympathizers, about the country, whom no one suspected;\nthe families of parents who had conformed to the established worship, nay,\nsometimes the apostates themselves, and that this was the case in Sicca as\nwell as elsewhere. For himself, old and ignorant as he was, the\npersecution had proved to him an education. He had been brought near great\nmen, and some who, he was confident, would be martyrs in the event. He had\nlearned a great deal about his religion which he did not know before, and\nhad drunk in the spirit of Christianity, with a fulness which he trusted\nwould not turn to his ultimate condemnation. He now too had a\nconsciousness of the size and populousness of the Church, of her\ndiffusion, of the promises made to her, of the essential necessity of what\nseemed to be misfortune, of the episcopal regimen, and of the power and\nsolidity of the see of Peter afar off in Rome, all which knowledge had\nmade him quite another being. We have put all this into finer language\nthan the good old man used himself, and we have grouped it more exactly,\nbut this is what his words would come to, when explained.\n\nComing down to sublunary matters, Aspar said the cave was well\nprovisioned; they had bread, oil, figs, dried grapes, and wine. They had\nvessels and vestments for the Holy Sacrifice. Their serious want was a\ndearth of water at that season, but they relied on Divine Providence to\ngive them by miracle, if in no other way, a supply. The place was\npiercingly cold too in the winter.\n\nBy this time they had gained the end of the long gallery, and passed\nthrough a second apartment, when suddenly the sounds of the ecclesiastical\nchant burst on the ear of Agellius. How strange, how transporting to him!\nhe was almost for the first time coming home to his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, though\nhe had been a Christian from a child, and never, as he trusted, to leave\nit, now that it was found. He did not know how to behave himself, nor\nindeed where to go. Aspar conducted him into the seats set apart for the\nfaithful; he knelt down and burst into tears.\n\nIt was approaching the third hour, the hour at which the Paraclete\noriginally descended upon the Apostles, and which, when times of\npersecution were passed, was appointed in the West for the solemn mass of\nthe day. In that early age, indeed, the time of the solemnity was\ngenerally midnight, in order to elude observation; but even then such an\nhour was considered of but temporary arrangement. Pope Telesphorus is said\nto have prescribed the hour, afterwards in use, as early even as the\nsecond century; and in a place of such quiet and security as the cavern in\nwhich we just now find ourselves, there was no reason why it should not be\nselected. At the lower end of the chapel was a rail extending across it,\nand open in the middle, where its two portions turned up at right angles\non each side towards the altar. The enclosure thus made was the place\nproper for the faithful, into which Agellius had been introduced, and\nabout fifty persons were collected about him. Where the two side-rails\nwhich ran up the chapel ceased, there was a broad step; and upon it two\npulpits, one on each side. Then came a second elevation, carrying the eye\non to the extremity of the upper end.\n\nIn the middle of the wall at that upper end is a recess, occupied by a\ntomb. On the front of it is written the name of some glorious champion of\nthe faith who lies there. It is one of the first bishops of Sicca, and the\ninscription attests that he slept in the Lord under the Emperor Antoninus.\nOver the sacred relics is a slab, and on the slab the Divine Mysteries are\nnow to be celebrated. At the back is a painting on the wall, very similar\nto that in Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cottage. The ever-blessed immaculate Mother of God\nis exercising her office as the Advocate of sinners, standing by the\nsacrifice as she stood at the cross itself, and offering up and applying\nits infinite merits and incommunicable virtue in union with priest and\npeople. So instinctive in the Christian mind is the principle of\ndecoration, as it may be called, that even in times of suffering, and\nplaces of banishment, we see it brought into exercise. Not only is the\narch which overspans the altar ornamented with an arabesque pattern, but\nthe roof or vault is coloured with paintings. Our Lord is in the centre,\nwith two figures of Moses on each side, on the right unloosing his\nsandals, on the left striking the rock. Between the centre figure and the\naltar may be seen the raising of Lazarus; in the opposite partition the\nhealing of the paralytic; at the four angles are men and women alternately\nin the attitude of prayer.\n\nAt this time the altar-stone was covered with a rich crimson silk, with\nfigures of St. Peter and St. Paul worked in gold upon it, the gift of a\npious lady of Carthage. Beyond the altar, but not touching it, was a\ncross; and on one side of the altar a sort of basin or _piscina_ cut in\nthe rock, with a linen cloth hanging up against it. There were no candles\nupon the altar itself, but wax lights fixed into silver stands were placed\nat intervals along the edge of the presbytery or elevation.\n\nThe mass was in behalf of the confessors for the faith then in prison in\nCarthage; and the sacred ministers, some half-hour after Agellius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nentrance, made their appearance. Their vestments already varied somewhat\nfrom the ordinary garments of the day, and bespoke antiquity; and, though\nnot so simply _sui generis_ as they are now, they were so far special,\nthat they were never used on any other occasion, but were reserved for the\nsacred service. The neck was bare, the amice being as yet unknown; instead\nof the stole was what was called the _orarium_, a sort of handkerchief\nresting on the shoulders, and falling down on each side. The alb had been\nthe inner garment, or _camisium_, which in civil use was retained at night\nwhen the other garments were thrown off; and, as at the present day, it\nwas confined round the waist by a zone or girdle. The maniple was a\nnapkin, supplying the place of a handkerchief; and the chasuble was an\nample _p\u00c3\u00a6nula_, such as was worn by the judges, a cloak enveloping the\nwhole person round, when spread out, with an opening in the centre,\nthrough which the head might pass. The deacon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dalmatic was much longer\nthan it is now, and the subdeacon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tunicle resembled the alb. All the\nvestments were of the purest white.\n\nThe mass began by the bishop giving his blessing; and then the Lector, a\nman of venerable age, taking the roll called _Lectionarium_, and\nproceeding to a pulpit, read the Prophets to the people, much in the way\nobserved among ourselves still on holy Saturday and the vigil of\nPentecost. These being finished, the people chanted the first verse of the\n_Gloria Patri_, after which the clergy alternated with the people the\n_Kyrie_, pretty much as the custom is now.\n\nHere a fresh roll was brought to the Lector, then or afterwards called\n_Apostolus_, from which he read one of the canonical epistles. A psalm\nfollowed, which was sung by the people; and, after this, the Lector\nreceived the _Evangeliarium_, and read a portion of the Gospel, at which\nlights were lighted, and the people stood. When he had finished, the\nLector opened the roll wide, and, turning round, presented it to bishop,\nclergy, and people to kiss.\n\nThe deacon then cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIte in pace, catechumeni,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDepart in peace,\ncatechumens;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then the kiss of peace was passed round, and the people\nbegan to sing some psalms or hymns. While they were so engaged, the deacon\nreceived from the acolyte the _sindon_, or corporal, which was of the\nlength of the altar, and perhaps of greater breadth, and spread it upon\nthe sacred table. Next was placed on the _sindon_ the _oblata_, that is,\nthe small loaves, according to the number of communicants, with the paten,\nwhich was large, and a gold chalice, duly prepared. And then the _sindon_,\nor corporal, was turned back over them, to cover them as a pall.\n\nThe celebrant then advanced: he stood at the further side of the altar,\nwhere the candles are now, with his face to the people, and then began the\nholy sacrifice. First he incensed the _oblata_, that is, the loaves and\nchalice, as an acknowledgment of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereign dominion, and as a token\nof uplifted prayer to Him. Then the roll of prayers was brought him, while\nthe deacon began what is sometimes called the bidding prayer, being a\ncatalogue of the various subjects for which intercession is to be made,\nafter the manner of the _Oremus dilectissimi_, now used on Good Friday.\nThis catalogue included all conditions of men, the conversion of the\nworld, the exaltation of Holy Church, the maintenance of the Roman empire,\nthe due ripening and gathering of the fruits of the earth, and other\nspiritual and temporal blessings,\u00e2\u0080\u0094subjects very much the same as those\nwhich are now called the Pope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions. The prayers ended with a\nspecial reference to those present, that they might persevere in the Lord\neven to the end. And then the priest began the _Sursum corda_, and said\nthe _Sanctus_.\n\nThe Canon or _Actio_ seems to have run, in all but a few words, as it does\nnow, and the solemn words of consecration were said secretly. Great stress\nwas laid on the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prayer, which in one sense terminated the function.\nIt was said aloud by the people, and when they said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cForgive us our\ntrespasses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they beat their breasts.\n\nIt is not wonderful that Agellius, assisting for almost the first time at\nthis wonderful solemnity, should have noted everything as it occurred; and\nwe must be considered as giving our account of it from his mouth.\n\nIt needs not to enlarge on the joy of the meeting which followed between\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius and his young penitent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI come to thee,\nnever to leave thee, to be thy dutiful servant, and to be trained by thee\nafter the pattern of Him who made thee what thou art. Wonderful things\nhave happened; Callista is in prison on the charge of Christianity; I was\nin a sort of prison myself, or what was worse for my soul; and Juba, my\nbrother, in the strangest of ways, has this morning let me out. Shall she\nnot be saved, my father, in God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own way, as well as I? At least we can\nall pray for her; but surely we can do more\u00e2\u0080\u0094so precious a soul must not be\nleft to herself and the world. If she has the trials, she may claim the\nblessings of a Christian. Is she to go back to heathenism? Is she, alas!\nto suffer without baptism? Shall we not hazard death to bestow on her that\ngrace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\n                               THE BAPTISM.\n\n\nWe have already had occasion to mention that there were many secret\nwell-wishers, or at least protectors, of Christians, as in the world at\nlarge, so also in Sicca. There were many persons who had received benefits\nfrom their charity, and had experience of the scandalous falsehood of the\ncharges now circulated against them. Others would feel a generosity\ntowards a cruelly persecuted body; others, utterly dead to the subject of\nreligion, or rather believing all religions to be impostures, would not\nallow it to be assumed that only one was worthy of bad treatment. Others\nliked what they heard of the religion itself, and thought there was truth\nin it, though it had no claim to a monopoly of truth. Others felt it to be\ntrue, but shrank from the consequences of openly embracing it. Others, who\nhad apostatised through fear of the executioner, intended to come back to\nit at the last. It must be added that in the African Church confessors in\nprison had, or were considered to have, the remarkable privilege of\ngaining the public forgiveness of the Church for those who had lapsed; it\nwas an object, then, for all those who, being in that miserable case,\nwished some day to be restored, to gain their promise of assistance, or\ntheir good-will. To these reasons was added, in Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, the\ninterest which naturally attached to a woman, young and defenceless.\n\nThe burning sun of Africa is at the height of its power. The population is\nprostrated by heat, by scarcity, by pestilence, and by the decimation\nwhich their riot brought upon them. They care neither for Christianity,\nnor for anything else just now. They lie in the porticoes, in the caverns\nunder the city, in the baths. They are more alive at night. The\n_apparitor_, in whose dwelling Callista was lodged, who was himself once a\nChristian, lies in the shade of the great doorway, into which his rooms\nopen, asleep, or stupefied. Two men make their appearance about two hours\nbefore sunset, and demand admittance to Callista. The jailor asks if they\nare not the two Greeks, her brother and the rhetorician, who had visited\nher before. The junior of the strangers drops a purse heavy with coin into\nhis lap, and passes on with his companion. When the mind is intent on\ngreat subjects or aims, heat and cold, hunger and thirst, lose their power\nof enfeebling it; thus perhaps we must account for the energy now\ndisplayed both by the two ecclesiastics and by Callista herself.\n\nShe too thought it was the unwelcome philosopher come again; she gave a\nstart and a cry of delight when she saw it was C\u00c3\u00a6cilius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to be a Christian, if I may; He came to save the lost sheep.\nI have learnt such things from this book\u00e2\u0080\u0094let me give it you while I can. I\nam not long for this world. Give me Him who spoke so kindly to that woman.\nTake from me my load of sin, and then I will gladly go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She knelt at his\nfeet, and gave the roll of parchment into his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRise and sit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us think calmly over the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ready,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she insisted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeny me not my wish, when time is so\nurgent\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I may have it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down calmly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said again; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not refusing you, but I wish to\nknow about you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He could hardly keep from tears, of pain, or of joy, or\nof both, when he saw the great change which trial had wrought in her. What\ntouched him most was the utter disappearance of that majesty of mien,\nwhich once was hers, a gift, so beautiful, so unsuitable to fallen man.\nThere was instead of it a frank humility, a simplicity without\nconcealment, an unresisting meekness, which seemed as if it would enable\nher, if trampled on, to smile and to kiss the feet that insulted her. She\nhad lost every vestige of what the world worships under the titles of\nproper pride and self-respect. Callista was now living, not in the thought\nof herself, but of Another.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod has been very good to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut in the volume you have\nreturned to me He bids us \u00e2\u0080\u0098reckon the charges.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Can you drink of His\nchalice? Recollect what is before you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe still continued kneeling, with a touching earnestness of face and\ndemeanour, and with her hands crossed upon her breast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI _have_ reckoned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cheaven and hell: I prefer heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are on earth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in heaven or hell. You must bear\nthe pangs of earth before you drink the blessedness of heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has given me the firm purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto gain heaven, to escape\nhell; and He will give me too the power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Callista!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, in a voice broken with distress, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know\nnot what you will have to bear, if you join yourself to Him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has done great things for me already; I am wonderfully changed; I am\nnot what I was. He will do more still.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas, my child!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat feeble frame, ah! how will it bear\nthe strong iron, or the keen flame, or the ruthless beast? My child, what\ndo _I_ feel, who am free, thus handing you over to be the sport of the\nevil one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather, I have chosen Him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot hastily, but on\ndeliberation. I believe Him most absolutely. Keep me not from Him; give\nHim to me, if I may ask it; give me my Love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPresently she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never forgotten those words of yours since\nyou used them; \u00e2\u0080\u0098Amor meus crucifixus est.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe began again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be a Christian; give me my place among them. Give\nme my place at the feet of Jesus, Son of Mary, my God. I wish to love Him.\nI think I can love Him. Make me His.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has loved you from eternity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, therefore, you are\nnow beginning to love Him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe covered her eyes with her hands, and remained in profound meditation.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very ignorant\u00e2\u0080\u0094very sinful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at length; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut one thing I\nknow, that there is but One to love in the whole world, and I wish to love\nhim. I surrender myself to Him, if He will take me; and He shall teach me\nabout Himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe angry multitude, their fierce voices, the brutal executioner, the\nprison, the torture, the slow, painful death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was speaking, not to\nher, but to himself. She was calm, in spite of her fervour; but he could\nnot contain himself. His heart melted within him; he felt like Abraham,\nlifting up his hand to slay his child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTime passes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat may happen? you may be discovered. But,\nperhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, suddenly changing her tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a matter of long\ninitiation. Woe is me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must gird ourselves to the work, Victor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to his deacon who\nwas with him. C\u00c3\u00a6cilius fell back and sat down, and Victor came forward. He\nformally instructed her so far as the circumstances allowed. Not for\nbaptism only, but for confirmation, and Holy Eucharist; for C\u00c3\u00a6cilius\ndetermined to give her all three sacraments at once.\n\nIt was a sight for angels to look down upon, and they did; when the poor\nchild, rich in this world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gifts, but poor in those of eternity, knelt\ndown to receive that sacred stream upon her brow, which fell upon her with\nalmost sensible sweetness, and suddenly produced a serenity different in\nkind from anything she had ever before even had the power of conceiving.\n\nThe bishop gave her confirmation, and then the Holy Eucharist. It was her\nfirst and last communion; in a few days she renewed it, or rather\ncompleted it, under the very Face and Form of Him whom she now believed\nwithout seeing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell, my dearest of children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctill the hour when we\nboth meet before the throne of God. A few sharp pangs which you can count\nand measure, and all will be well. You will be carried through joyously,\nand like a conqueror. I know it. You could face the prospect before you\nwere a Christian, and you will be equal to the actual trial, now that you\nare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever fear me, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a clear, low voice. The bishop and\nhis deacon left the prison.\n\n\n\nThe sun had all but set, when C\u00c3\u00a6cilius and Victor passed the city gate;\nand it was more than twilight as they crossed the wild hills leading to\nthe precipitous pass. Evil men were not their only peril in this work of\ncharity. They were also in danger from wild beasts in these lone wastes,\nand, the heathen would have added, from bad spirits. Bad spirits C\u00c3\u00a6cilius\nrecognised too; but he would not have granted that they were perilous. The\ntwo went forward, saying prayers lowly, and singing psalms, when a sudden\ncry was heard, and a strong tall form rushed past them. It might be some\nrobber of the wild, or dangerous outcast, or savage fanatic, who knew and\nhated their religion; however, while they stopped and looked, he had come,\nand he was gone. But he came again, more slowly; and from his remarkable\nshape C\u00c3\u00a6cilius saw that it was the brother of Agellius. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJuba;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJuba started back, and stood at a distance. C\u00c3\u00a6cilius held out his hand,\nand called him on, again mentioning his name. The poor fellow came nearer:\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work was not at an end.\n\nSince we last heard of him, Juba had dwelt in the mountainous tract over\nwhich the two Christians were now passing; roaming to and fro, or beating\nhimself in idle fury against the adamantine rocks, and fighting with the\nstern necessity of the elements. How he was sustained can hardly be\nguessed, unless the impulse, which led him on the first accession of his\nfearful malady, to fly upon the beasts of the desert, served him here\nalso. Roots too and fruits were scattered over the wild; and still more so\nin the ravines, wherever any quantity of soil had been accumulated. Alas!\nhad the daylight lasted, in him too, as well as in Callista, C\u00c3\u00a6cilius\nwould have found changes, but of a very different nature; yet even in him\nhe would have seen a change for the better, for that old awful expression\nof pride and defiance was gone. What was the use of parading a self-will,\nwhich every moment of his life belied? His actions, his words, his hands,\nhis lips, his feet, his place of abode, his daily course, were in the\ndominion of another, who inexorably ruled him. It was not the gentle\ninfluence which draws and persuades; it was not the power which can be\npropitiated by prayer; it was a tyranny which acted without reaction,\nenergetic as mind, and impenetrable as matter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJuba,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said C\u00c3\u00a6cilius a third time. The maniac came nearer, and then again\nsuddenly retreated. He stood at a short distance from C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, as if\nafraid to come on, and cried out, tossing his hands wildly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAway, black\nhypocrite, come not near me! Away! hound of a priest, cross not my path,\nlest I tear you to shreds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such visitations were no novelties to\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius; he raised his hand and made the sign of the cross, then he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Juba advanced, shrieked, and used some terrible words, and rushed\nupon C\u00c3\u00a6cilius, as if he would treat him as he had treated the savage wolf.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes, I come!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Victor ran up, fearing his teeth\nwould be in C\u00c3\u00a6cilius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat, if he delayed longer. The latter stood his\nground, quailing neither in eye nor in limb; he made the sign of the cross\na second time; and in spite of a manifest antagonism within him, the\nstricken youth, with horrid cries, came dancing after him.\n\nThus they proceeded, with some signs of insurrection from time to time on\nJuba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, but with a successful reduction of it as often on the part of\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius, till they got to the ascent by the olive-trees, where careful\nwalking was necessary. Then C\u00c3\u00a6cilius turned round, and beckoned him. He\ncame. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKneel down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He knelt down. C\u00c3\u00a6cilius put his hand on his\nhead, saying to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me close and without any disturbance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nthree pursued their journey, and all arrived safe at the cavern. There\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius gave Juba in charge to Romanus, who had been intrusted with the\n_energumens_ at Carthage.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\n                          THE IMPERIAL RESCRIPT.\n\n\nHad the imperial edict been acted on by the magistrates of Sicca, without\na reference to Carthage, it is not easy to suppose that Callista would\nhave persevered in her refusal to commit the act of idolatry required of\nher. But, to speak of second causes, the hesitation of her judges was her\nsalvation. Once baptised, there was no reason she should desire any\nfurther delay of her conflict. Come it must, and come it did. While\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius was placing her beyond danger, the rescript of the Proconsul had\nbeen received at the office of the Duumvirs.\n\nThe absence of the Proconsul from Carthage had been the cause of the\ndelay; and then, some investigation was needed to understand the relation\nof Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seizure to the riot on the one hand, and to the strong act\nof the military on the other, in quelling it. It was thought that\nsomething or other might come to light to account for the anomalous and\nunaccountable position which she had taken up. The imperial government\nconsidered it had now a clear view of her case, and its orders were\ndistinct and peremptory. Christianity was to cease to be. It was a subtle\nfoe, sapping the vitals of the state. Rome must perish, or this illegal\nassociation. Such evasions as Callista had used were but instances of its\ncraft. Its treason lay, not in its being Christianity, but in its not\nsacrificing to the gods of Rome. Callista was but throwing dust in their\neyes. There had been no blow struck against the treason in inland Africa.\nWomen had often been the most dangerous of conspirators. As she was a\nstranger, there was more probability of her connection with secret\nsocieties, and also less inconvenience in her execution. Whatever\nhappened, she was to be got rid of; but first her resolution was to be\nbroken, for the sake of the example. First, let her be brought before the\ntribunal and threatened: then thrust into the Tullianum; then put upon the\nrack, and returned to prison; then scorched over a slow fire; last of all,\nbeheaded, and left for beasts of prey. She would sacrifice ere the last\nstage was reached. When she had given way, let her be given up to the\ngladiators. The message ended by saying that the Proconsular Procurator,\nwho came by the same carriages, would preside at the process.\n\nO wisdom of the world! and strength of the world! what are you when\nmatched beside the foolishness and the weakness of the Christian? You are\ngreat in resources, manifold in methods, hopeful in prospects; but one\nthing you have not,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that is peace. You are always tumultuous,\nrestless, apprehensive. You have nothing you can rely upon. You have no\nrock under your feet. But the humblest, feeblest Christian has that which\nis impossible to you. Callista had once felt the misery of maladies akin\nto yours. She had passed through doubt, anxiety, perplexity, despondency,\npassion; but now she was in peace. Now she feared the torture or the flame\nas little as the breeze which arose at nightfall, or the busy chatter of\nthe grasshoppers at the noonday. Nay, rather, she did not think of torture\nand death at all, but was possessed by a peace which bore her up, as if\nbodily, on its mighty wings. For hours she remained on her knees, after\nC\u00c3\u00a6cilius left her: then she lay down on her rushes and slept her last\nsleep.\n\nShe slept sound; she dreamed. She thought she was no longer in Africa, but\nin her own Greece, more sunny and bright than before; but the inhabitants\nwere gone. Its majestic mountains, its rich plains, its expanse of waters,\nall silent: no one to converse with, no one to sympathize with. And, as\nshe wandered on and wondered, suddenly its face changed, and its colours\nwere illuminated tenfold by a heavenly glory, and each hue upon the scene\nwas of a beauty she had never known, and seemed strangely to affect all\nher senses at once, being fragrance and music, as well as light. And there\ncame out of the grottoes and glens and woods, and out of the seas, myriads\nof bright images, whose forms she could not discern; and these came all\naround her, and became a sort of scene or landscape, which she could not\nhave described in words, as if it were a world of spirits, not of matter.\nAnd as she gazed, she thought she saw before her a well-known face, only\nglorified. She, who had been a slave, now was arrayed more brilliantly\nthan an oriental queen; and she looked at Callista with a smile so sweet,\nthat Callista felt she could but dance to it.\n\nAnd as she looked more earnestly, doubting whether she should begin or\nnot, the face changed, and now was more marvellous still. It had an\ninnocence in its look, and also a tenderness, which bespoke both Maid and\nMother, and so transported Callista, that she must needs advance towards\nher, out of love and reverence. And the lady seemed to make signs of\nencouragement: so she began a solemn measure, unlike all dances of earth,\nwith hands and feet, serenely moving on towards what she heard some of\nthem call a great action and a glorious consummation, though she did not\nknow what they meant. At length she was fain to sing as well as dance; and\nher words were, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\nHoly Ghost;\u00e2\u0080\u009d on which another said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA good beginning of the sacrifice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd when she had come close to this gracious figure, there was a fresh\nchange. The face, the features were the same; but the light of Divinity\nnow seemed to beam through them, and the hair parted, and hung down long\non each side of the forehead; and there was a crown of another fashion\nthan the Lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s round about it, made of what looked like thorns. And the\npalms of the hands were spread out as if towards her, and there were marks\nof wounds in them. And the vestment had fallen, and there was a deep\nopening in the side. And as she stood entranced before Him, and\nmotionless, she felt a consciousness that her own palms were pierced like\nHis, and her feet also. And she looked round, and saw the likeness of His\nface and of His wounds upon all that company. And now they were suddenly\nmoving on, and bearing something or some one, heavenwards; and they too\nbegan to sing, and their words seemed to be, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRejoice with Me, for I have\nfound My sheep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ever repeated. They went up through an avenue or long\ngrotto, with torches of diamonds, and amethysts, and sapphires, which lit\nup its spars and made them sparkle. And she tried to look, but could not\ndiscover what they were carrying, till she heard a very piercing cry,\nwhich awoke her.\n\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\n                            A GOOD CONFESSION.\n\n\nThe cry came from the keeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, whom we have described as kindly\ndisposed to her. She was a Lybo-Ph\u00c5\u0093nician, and spoke a broken Latin; but\nthe language of sympathy is universal, in spite of Babel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCallista,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nexclaimed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cgirl, they have sent for you; you are to die. O frightful!\nworse than a runaway slave,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the torture! Give in. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the harm? you are\nso young: those terrible men with the pincers and hot bars!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista sat up, and passed from her vision to her prison. She smiled and\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ready; I am going home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The woman looked almost frightened,\nand with some shade of disgust and disappointment. She, as others, might\nhave thought it impossible, as it was unaccountable, that when it came to\nthe point Callista would hold out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ready,\nmother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Callista said, and she got up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been very good to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe continued; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been saying many prayers for you, while my prayers\nwere of no good, for then He was not mine. But now I have espoused Him,\nand am going to be married to-day, and He will hear me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The woman stared\nat her stupidly, as much as to make it evident that if afterwards a change\ntook place in her, as in Callista, that change too, though in so different\na soul, must come of something beyond nature. She had something in her\nhand, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s useless to give a mad woman like her the packet,\nwhich my man has brought me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista took the packet, which was directed to her, and broke the seal.\nIt was from her brother. The little roll of worn parchment opened; a\ndagger fell out. Some lines were written on the parchment; they were dated\nCarthage, and ran as follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAristo to his dearest Callista. I write through Cornelius. You have not\nhad it in your power to kill me, but you have taken away half my life. For\nme, I will cherish the other half, for I love life better than death. But\nyou love annihilation; yet, if so, die not like a slave. Die nobly,\nmindful of your country; I send you the means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCallista was beyond reflecting on anything around her, except as in a sort\nof dream. As common men think and speak of heaven, so she now thought and\nspoke of earth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish _Him_ to kill me, not myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am His\nvictim. My brother! I have no brother, except One, who is calling me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was carried to court, and the examination followed. We have already\ngiven a specimen of such a process; here it will be sufficient to make use\nof two documents, different in kind, as far as they go, which have come\ndown to us. The first is an alto-relief, which once was coloured, not\nfirst-rate in art or execution, and of the date of the Emperor\nConstantius, about a century later. It was lately discovered in the course\nof excavations made at El Kaf, the modern Sicca, on the ruins of a church\nor Roman basilica, for the building in question seems to have served each\npurpose successively. In this sculpture the pr\u00c3\u00a6torium is represented, and\nthe tribunal of the president in it. The tribunal is a high throne, with\nwings curving round on each side, making the whole construction extend to\nalmost a semicircle, and it is ascended by steps between the wings. The\ncurule chair is at the top of the steps; and in the middle and above it\nare purple curtains, reaching down to the platform, drawn back on each\nside, and when drawn close together running behind the chair, and\nconstituting what was called the _secretarium_. On one side of the\ntribunal is a table covered with carpeting, and looking something like a\nmodern ottoman, only higher, and not level at top; and it has upon it the\nBook of Mandates, the sign of jurisdiction. The sword too is represented\nin the sculpture, to show a criminal case is proceeding. The procurator is\nseated on the chair; he is in purple, and has a gold chain of triple\nthread. We can also distinguish his lawyers, whether assessors or\n_consiliarii_; also his lictors and soldiers. There, too, are the notaries\nin a line below him; they are writing down the judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions and the\nprisoner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answers: and one of them is turning round to her, as if to make\nher speak more loudly. She herself is mounted upon a sort of platform,\ncalled _catasta_, like that on which slaves were put up for sale. Two\nsoldiers are by her, who appear to have been dragging her forwards. The\nexecutioners are also delineated, naked to the waist, with instruments of\ntorture in their hands.\n\n\n\nThe second document is a fragment of the _Acta Proconsularia_ of her\nPassion. If, indeed, it could be trusted to the letter, as containing\nCallista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answers word for word, it would have a distinctly sacred\ncharacter, in consequence of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shall be given you in\nthat hour what to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, we attach no such special value to this\ndocument, since it comes to us through heathen notaries, who may not have\nbeen accurate reporters; not to say that before we did so we ought to look\nvery carefully into its genuineness. As it is, we believe it to be as true\nas any part of our narrative, and not truer. It runs as follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCneius Messius Decius Augustus II., and Gratus, Consuls, on the seventh\nbefore the Calends of August, in Sicca Veneria, a colony, in the Secretary\nat the Tribunal, Martianus, procurator, sitting; Callista, a maker of\nimages, was brought up by the Commentariensis on a charge of Christianity,\nand when she was placed,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: This folly has been too long; you have\nmade images, and now you will not worship them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA answered: For I have found my true Love, whom before I knew not.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: Your true love is, I ween, your last\nlove; for all were true in their time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: I worship my true Love, who is the Only True; and He is\nthe Son of God, and I know none but Him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: You will not worship the gods, but you\nare willing to love their sons.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: He is the true Son of the True God; and I am His, and He\nis mine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: Let alone your loves, and swear by the\ngenius of the emperor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: I have but one Lord, the King of kings, the Ruler of all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, turned to the lictor and said: This folly is\nmadness; take her hand, put incense in it, and hold it over the flame.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: You may compel me by your great strength, but my own true\nLord and Love is stronger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: You are bewitched; but we must undo the\nspell. Take her to the Lignum (the prison for criminals).\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: He has been there before me, and He will come to me there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: The jailer will see to that. Let her be\nbrought up to-morrow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the day following, Martianus, the procurator, sitting at the tribunal,\ncalled up Callista. He said: Honour our lord, and sacrifice to the gods.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: Let me alone; I am content with my One and only Lord.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: What? did he come to you in prison, as\nyou hoped?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: He came to me amid much pain; and the pain was pleasant,\nfor He came in it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: You have got worn and yellow, and he\nwill leave you.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: He loves me the more, for I am beautiful when I am black.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMARTIANUS, the procurator, said: Throw her into the Tullianum; perhaps\nshe will find her god there also.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen the procurator entered into the Secretary, and drew the veil; and\ndictated the sentence for the tabella. Then he came out, and the pr\u00c3\u00a6co\nread it:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Callista, a senseless and reprobate woman, is hereby sentenced to\nbe thrown into the Tullianum; then to be stretched on the equuleus; then\nto be placed on a slow fire; lastly, to be beheaded, and left to the dogs\nand birds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCALLISTA said: Thanks to my Lord and King.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nHere the Acta end: and though they seem to want their conclusion, yet they\nsupply nearly every thing which is necessary for our purpose. The one\nsubject on which a comment is needed, is the state prison, which, though\nso little is said of it in the above Report, is in fact the real _medium_,\nas we may call it, for appreciating its information; a few words will\nsuffice for our purpose.\n\nThe state prison, then, was arranged on pretty much one and the same plan\nthrough the Roman empire, nay, we may say, throughout the ancient world.\nIt was commonly attached to the government buildings, and consisted of two\nparts. The first was the vestibule, or outward prison, which was a hall,\napproached from the pr\u00c3\u00a6torium, and surrounded by cells, opening into it.\nThe prisoners, who were confined in these cells, had the benefit of the\nair and light, which the hall admitted. Such was the place of confinement\nallotted to St. Paul at C\u00c3\u00a6sarea, which is said to be the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpr\u00c3\u00a6torium of\nHerod.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And hence, perhaps, it is that, in the touching Passion of St.\nPerpetua and St. Felicitas, St. Perpetua tells us that, when permitted to\nhave her child, though she was in the inner portion, which will next be\ndescribed, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuddenly the prison seemed to her like the pr\u00c3\u00a6torium.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom this vestibule there was a passage into the interior prison, called\nRobur or Lignum, from the beams of wood, which were the instruments of\nconfinement, or from the character of its floor. It had no window or\noutlet, except this door, which, when closed, absolutely shut out light\nand air. Air, indeed, and coolness might be obtained for it by the\n_barathrum_, presently to be spoken of, but of what nature we shall then\nsee. The apartment, called Lignum, was the place into which St. Paul and\nSt. Silas were cast at Philippi, before it was known that they were\nRomans. After scourging them severely, the magistrates, who nevertheless\nwere but the local authorities, and had no proper jurisdiction in criminal\ncases, \u00e2\u0080\u009cput them in prison, bidding the jailer to keep them carefully;\nwho, on receiving such a command, put them in the inner prison, and\nfastened them in the lignum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And in the Acts of the Scillitane Martyrs we\nread of the Proconsul giving sentence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them be thrown into prison,\nlet them be put into the Lignum, till to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe utter darkness, the heat, and the stench of this miserable place, in\nwhich the inmates were confined day and night, is often dwelt upon by the\nmartyrs and their biographers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter a few days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says St. Perpetua, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\nwere taken to the prison, and I was frightened, for I never had known such\ndarkness. O bitter day! the heat was excessive by reason of the crowd\nthere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the Acts of St. Pionius, and others of Smyrna, we read that the\njailers \u00e2\u0080\u009cshut them up in the inner part of the prison, so that, bereaved\nof all comfort and light, they were forced to sustain extreme torment,\nfrom the darkness and stench of the prison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, in like manner, other\nmartyrs of Africa, about the time of St. Cyprian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s martyrdom, that is,\neight or ten years later than the date of this story, say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were not\nfrightened at the foul darkness of that place; for soon that murky prison\nwas radiant with the brightness of the Spirit. What days, what nights we\npassed there no words can describe. The torments of that prison no\nstatement can equal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYet there was a place of confinement even worse than this. In the floor of\nthis inner prison was a sort of trap-door, or hole, opening into the\n_barathrum_, or pit, and called, from the original prison at Rome, the\nTullianum. Sometimes prisoners were confined here, sometimes despatched by\nbeing cast headlong into it through the opening. It was into this pit at\nRome that St. Chrysanthus was cast; and there, and probably in other\ncities, it was nothing short of the public cesspool.\n\nIt may be noticed that the Prophet Jeremiah seems to have had personal\nacquaintance with Vestibule, Robur, and Barathrum. We read in one place of\nhis being shut up in the \u00e2\u0080\u009catrium,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is, the vestibule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof the prison,\nwhich was in the house of the king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At another time he is in the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cergastulum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would seem to be the inner prison. Lastly his enemies\nlet him down by ropes into the lacus or pit, in which \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere was no water,\nbut mud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs to Callista, then, after the first day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examination, she was thrown\nfor nearly twenty-four hours into the stifling Robur, or inner prison.\nAfter the sentence, on the second day, she was let down, as the\ncommencement of her punishment, that is, of her martyrdom, into the\nloathsome Barathrum, lacus, or pit, called Tullianum, there to lie for\nanother twenty hours before she was brought out to the equuleus or rack.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\n                              THE MARTYRDOM.\n\n\nCallista had sighed for the bright and clear atmosphere of Greece, and she\nwas thrown into the Robur and plunged into the Barathrum of Sicca. But in\nreality, though she called it Greece, she was panting after a better\ncountry and a more lasting home, and this country and home she had found.\nShe was now setting out for it.\n\nIt was, indeed, no slight marvel that she was not already there. She had\nbeen lowered into that pit of death before noon on the day of her second\nexamination, and, excepting some unwholesome bread and water, according to\nthe custom of the prison, had had no food since she came into the custody\nof the _commentariensis_ the day before. The order came from the\nmagistrates to bring her out earlier in the morning than was intended, or\nthe prison might have really effected that death which Calphurnius had\npurposed to pretend. When the apparitors attempted to raise her, she\nneither spoke or moved, nor could well be seen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack as Orcus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one\nof the fellows, \u00e2\u0080\u009canother torch there! I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see where she nestles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere she is, like a bundle of clothes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam gets up\nlate this morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a third. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used to softer couches,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a\nfourth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! ha! \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a spoiler of beauty, this hole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a fifth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\nis the demon of stubbornness, and must be crushed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the jailer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\nlikes it, or she would not choose it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plague take the witch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nanother; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall have better seasons when a few like her are ferreted\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey got her out like a corpse, and put her on the ground outside the\nprison. When she still did not move, two of them took her between them on\ntheir shoulders and arms, and began to move forward, the instrument of\ntorture preceding her. The fresh air of the morning revived her; she soon\nsat up. She seemed to drink in life again, and became conscious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO\nbeautiful Light!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO lovely Light, my light and my life! O\nmy Light and my Life, receive me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gradually she became fully alive to all\nthat was going on. She was going to death, and that rather than deny Him\nwho had bought her by His own death. He had suffered for her, and she was\nto suffer for Him. He had been racked on the Cross, she too was to have\nher limbs dislocated after His pattern. She scarcely rested on the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshoulders; and they vowed afterwards that they thought she was going to\nfly away, vile witch as she was.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe witch, the witch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mob screamed out, for she had now come to the\nplace of her conflict. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll_ pay you off for blight and pestilence!\nWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our bread, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the maize and barley, where are the grapes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd they uttered fierce yells of execration, and seemed disposed to break\nthrough the line of apparitors, and to tear her to pieces. Yet, after all,\nit was not a very hearty uproar, but got up for the occasion. The populace\nhad spent their force, not to say their lives, in the riot in which she\nwas apprehended. The priests and priestesses of the temples had sent the\npoor wretches and paid them.\n\nThe place of execution was on the north-east of the city, outside the\nwalls, and towards the mountain. It was where slaves were buried, and it\nwas as hideous as such spots usually were. The neighbourhood was wild,\nopen to the beasts of prey, who at night used to descend and feast upon\nthe corpses. As Callista approached to the scene of her suffering, the\nexpression of her countenance had so altered that a friend would scarce\nhave known it. There was a tenderness in it and a modesty which never had\nbeen there in that old time. Her cheek had upon it a blush, as when the\nrising sun suddenly touches some grey rock or tower yet it was white and\nglistening too, so much so that others might have said it was like silver.\nHer eyes were larger than they had been, and gazed steadfastly, as if at\nwhat the multitude did not see. Her lips spoke of sweet peace and deep\ncomposure. When at length she came close upon the rabble, who had been\nscreaming and yelling so fiercely, men, women, and boys suddenly held\ntheir peace. It was first from curiosity, then from amazement, then from\nawe. At length a fear smote through them, and a strange pity and\nreverence. They almost seemed inclined to worship what stirred them so\nmuch, they knew not how; a new idea had visited those poor ignorant souls.\n\nA few minutes sufficed to put the rack into working order. She was laid\ndown upon its board in her poor bedimmed tunic, which once flashed so\nbright in the sun,\u00e2\u0080\u0094she who had been ever so delicate in her apparel. Her\nwrists and ankles were seized, extended, fastened to the moveable blocks\nat the extremities of the plank. She spoke her last word, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Thee, my\nLord and Love, for Thee!... Accept me, O my Love, upon this bed of pain!\nAnd come to me, O my Love, make haste and come!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The men turned round the\nwheels rapidly to and fro; the joints were drawn out of their sockets, and\nthen snapped in again. She had fainted. They waited for her coming-to;\nthey still waited; they got impatient.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDash some water on her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpit in her face, and it will do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid a second. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrick her with your spike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a third. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your wild\ntalk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a fourth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone to the shades.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They gathered round, and\nlooked at her attentively. They could not bring her back. So it was: she\nhad gone to her Lord and her Love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLay her out for the wolves and vultures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the _cornicularius_, and\nhe was going to appoint guards till nightfall, when up came the\n_stationarii_ and Calphurnius in high wrath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou dogs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat trick have you been practising against the\nsoldiers of Rome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, expostulation and reproach were bootless; nor\nwould it answer here to go into the quarrel which ensued over the dead\nbody. The magistrates, having got scent of Calphurnius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scheme, had\noutwitted the tribune by assigning an earlier hour than was usual for the\nexecution. Life could not be recalled; nor did the soldiers of course dare\npublicly to disobey the Proconsul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order for the exposure of the corpse.\nAll that could be done, they did. They took her down with rude reverence\nfrom the rack, and placed her on the sand; and then they set guards to\nkeep off the rabble, and to avail themselves of any opportunity which\nmight occur to show consideration towards her.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\n                             THE CORPO SANTO.\n\n\nThe sun of Africa has passed over the heavens, but has not dared with one\nof his fierce rays to profane the sacred relics which lie out before him.\nThe mists of evening rise up, and the heavy dews fall, but they neither\nbring the poison of decay to that gracious body, nor receive it thence.\nThe beasts of the wild are roaming and roaring at a distance, or nigh at\nhand: not any one of them presumes to touch her. No vultures may promise\nthemselves a morning meal from such a victim, as they watch through the\nnight upon the high crags which overlook her. The stars have come out on\nhigh, and, they too look down upon Callista, as if they were funeral\nlights in her honour. Next the moon rises up to see what has been going\non, and edges the black hangings of the night with silver. Yet mourning\nand dirge are but of formal observance, when a brave champion has died for\nher God. The world of ghosts has as little power over such an one as the\nworld of nature. No evil spirit has aught to say to her, who has gone in\nher baptismal white before the Throne. No penal fire shall be her robe,\nwho has been carried in her bright _flammeum_ to the Bridal Chamber of the\nLamb. A divine odour fills the air, issuing from that senseless,\nmotionless, broken frame. A circle of light gleams round her brow, and,\neven when the daylight comes again, it there is faintly seen. Her features\nhave reassumed their former majesty, but with an expression of childlike\ninnocence and heavenly peace. The thongs have drawn blood at the wrists\nand ankles, which has run and soaked into the sand; but angels received\nthe body from the soldiers when they took it off the rack, and it lies,\nsweetly and modestly composed, upon the ground.\n\nPassers-by stand still and gaze; idlers gather round. The report spreads\nin Sicca that neither sun by day, nor moon by night, nor moist atmosphere,\nnor beast of prey, has power over the wonderful corpse. Nay, that they\ncannot come near it without falling under some strange influence, which\nmakes them calm and grave, expels bad passions, and allays commotion of\nmind. Many come again and again, for the mysterious and soothing effect\nshe exerts upon them. They cannot talk freely about it to each other, and\nare seized with a sacred fear when they attempt to do so. Those who have\nmerely heard their report without seeing her, say that these men have been\nin a grove of the Eumenides, or have suddenly encountered the wolf. The\npopular sensation continues and extends; some say it is magical, others\nthat it is from the great gods. Day sinks again into evening, evening\nbecomes night; the night wears out, and morning is coming again.\n\nIt begins to dawn: a glimmer is faintly spread abroad, and, mixing with\nthe dark, makes twilight, which gradually brightens, and the outlines of\nnature rise dimly out of the night. Gradually the sacred body comes to\nsight; and, as the light grows stronger around it, gradually too the forms\nof five men emerge, who had not been there the night before. One is in\nfront; the rest behind with a sort of bier or litter. They stand on the\nmountain side of her, and must have come from the country. It has been a\nbold enterprise theirs, to expose themselves to the nightly beasts, and\nnow again to the rabble and the soldiers. The soldiers are at some little\ndistance, silent and watchful; such of the rabble as have passed the night\nthere have had some superstitious object in their stay. They have thought\nto get portions of the flesh for magical purposes; a finger, or a tooth,\nor some hair, or a portion of her tunic, or the blood-stained rope which\nwas twisted round her wrist and ankle.\n\nAs the light makes her at length quite visible to the youth on the other\nside, who stands by himself with clasped hands and tearful eyes, he\nshrinks from the sight. He turns round to his companions who are provided\nwith a large winding-sheet or pall, and with the help of one of them, to\nthe surprise of the populace, he spreads it all over the body. And having\ndone this, he stands again trembling, just for a few seconds, absorbed in\nhis meditations, praying and weeping, and nerving himself for what is to\nfollow. Ah, poor Agellius! you have not risen yet to the pitch of triumph;\nand other thoughts must be let to range through your breast, other\nemotions must spend themselves, before you are prepared simply to rejoice,\nexult, and glory in the lifeless form which lies before you. You are upon\na brave work, but your heart is torn while you set hand to it, and you\nlinger before you begin.\n\nIt was in the pride of her earthly beauty and the full vigour and\nelevation of her mind, that he last had seen her. It seemed an age since\nthat morning, as if a chasm ran between the now and the then, when she so\nfascinated him with her presence, and so majestically rebuked him for\nbowing to that fascination. Yet on his memory every incident of that\ninterview was fixed, and was indelible. O why should the great Creator\nshatter one of His most admirable works! If the order of the sun and stars\nis adorable, if the laws by which earth and sea are kept together mark the\nHand of supreme Wisdom and Power, how much nobler perfection of beauty is\nmanifested in man! And of human nature itself here was the supereminent\ncrown, a soul full of gifts, full of greatness, full of intellect, placed\nin an outward form, equally surpassing in its kind, and still more\nsurpassingly excellent from its intimate union and subordination to the\nsoul, so as almost to be its simple expression; yet this choicest, rarest\nspecimen of Almighty skill, the Almighty had pitilessly shattered, in\norder that it might inherit a higher, an eternal perfection. O mystery of\nmysteries, that heaven should not be possibly obtained without such\ngrinding down and breaking up of our original nature! O mysterious, that\nprinciple in us, whatever it is, and however it came there, which is so\nantagonistic to God, which has so spoilt what seems so good, that all must\nbe undone, and must begin anew! \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn enemy hath done this;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, knowing as\nmuch as this, and no more, we must leave the awful mystery to that day\nwhen all things shall be made light.\n\nAgellius has not been idle while these thoughts pass through his mind. He\nhas stooped down and scooped up such portions of the sand as are moistened\nwith her blood, and has committed them to a small bag which he has taken\nout of his bosom. Then without delay, looking round to his attendants, and\nsigning to them, with two of the party he resolutely crossed over to the\nother side of the corpse, covering it from attack, while his two\nassistants who were left proceeded quickly to lay hold of it. They had\nraised it, laid it on the bier, and were setting off by an unusual track\nacross the waste, while Agellius, Aspar, and the third were grappling with\nsome ruffians who had rushed upon them. Few, however, were there as yet to\ntake part against them, but their cries of alarm were bringing others up,\nand the Christians were in growing danger of being worsted and carried\noff, when suddenly the soldiers interfered. Under pretence of keeping the\npeace, they laid about them with their heavy maces; and so it was, the\nblows took effect on the heads and shoulders of the rabble, with but\nslight injury to Agellius and his companions. The latter took instant\nadvantage of the diversion, and vanished out of view by the same\nmisleading track which their comrades had already chosen. If they, or the\nparty who had preceded them, came within the range of sight of any\ngoatherds upon the mountains, we must suppose that angels held those\nheathen eyes that they should not recognise them.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n\n                    LUX PERPETUA SANCTIS TUIS, DOMINE.\n\n\nThe bier and its bearers, and its protectors, have reached the cave in\nsafety, and pace down the gallery, preceded by its Christian hosts, with\nlighted tapers, singing psalms. They place the sacred body before the\naltar, and the mass begins. St. Cyprian celebrates, and after the Gospel,\nhe adds a few words of his own.\n\nHe said that they were engaged in praising, blessing, and exalting the\nadorable Grace of God, which had snatched so marvellously a brand out of\nthe furnace. Benedicamus Patrem et Filium cum Sancto Spiritu. Benedictus,\net laudabilis, et gloriosus, et superexaltatus in s\u00c3\u00a6cula. Every day doing\nmarvels and exceeding all that seemed possible in power and love, by new\nand still newer manifestations. A Greek had come to Africa to embellish\nthe shrines of heathenism, to minister to the usurpation of the evil one,\nand to strengthen the old ties which connected genius with sin; and she\nhad suddenly found salvation. But yesterday a poor child of earth, and\nto-day an inhabitant of the heavens. But yesterday without God and without\nhope; and to-day a martyr with a green palm and golden vestment,\nworshipping before the Throne. But yesterday the slave of Satan, and\nspending herself on the vanities of time; and to-day drinking of the\nnever-cloying torrents of bliss everlasting. But yesterday one of a\nnumber, a grain of a vast heap, destined indiscriminately for the flame;\nto-day one of the elect souls, written from eternity in the book of life,\nand predestined to glory. But yesterday, hungry and thirsty, and restless\nfor some object worthy an immortal spirit; to-day enjoying the ineffable\necstasy of the Marriage Feast and the espousals of Emmanuel. But yesterday\ntossed about on a sea of opinion; and to-day entranced in the vision of\ninfallible truth and immutable sanctity. And yet what was she but only one\ninstance out of ten thousand, of the Almighty and All-manifold Grace of\nthe Redeemer? And who was there of all of them, there assembled, from the\nmost heroic down to the humblest beginner, from the authoritative preacher\ndown to the slave or peasant, but was equally, though in his own way, a\nmiracle of mercy, and a vessel, once of wrath, if now of glory? Only might\nhe and all who heard him persevere as they had begun, so that if (as was\nso probable) their trial was to be like hers, its issue might be like hers\nalso.\n\nSt. Cyprian ceased; and, while the deacon opened the _sindon_ for the\noffertory, the faithful took up alternately the verses of a hymn, which we\nhere insert in a most unworthy translation:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe number of Thine own complete,\n    Sum up and make an end;\n  Sift clean the chaff, and house the wheat,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n    And then, O Lord, descend.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDescend, and solve by that descent,\n    This mystery of life;\n  Where good and ill, together blent,\n    Wage an undying strife.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor rivers twain are gushing still,\n    And pour a mingled flood;\n  Good in the very depths of ill\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n    Ill in the heart of good.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last are first, the first are last,\n    As angel eyes behold;\n  These from the sheepcote sternly cast,\n    Those welcomed to the fold.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Christian home, no pastor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye,\n    No preacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vocal zeal,\n  Moved Thy dear martyr to defy\n    The prison and the wheel.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cForth from the heathen ranks she stepped\n    The forfeit throne to claim\n  Of Christian souls who had not kept\n    Their birthright and their name.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrace formed her out of sinful dust;\n    She knelt a soul defiled;\n  She rose in all the faith and trust\n    And sweetness of a child.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd in the freshness of that love\n    She preached by word and deed,\n  The mysteries of the world above\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n    Her new-found glorious creed.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd running, in a little hour,\n    Of life the course complete,\n  She reached the throne of endless power,\n    And sits at Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feet.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer spirit there, her body here,\n    Make one the earth and sky;\n  We use her name, we touch her bier,\n    We know her God is nigh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe last sentiment of the yet unfinished hymn was receiving an answer\nwhile they sang it. Juba had been brought into the chapel in the hands of\nhis brother and the exorcists. Since he had been under their care, he had\nbeen, on the whole, calm and manageable, with intervals of wild tempest\nand mad terror. He spoke, at times, of an awful incubus weighing on his\nchest, which he could not throw off, and said he hoped that they would not\nthink all the blasphemies he uttered were his own. On this occasion, he\nstruggled most violently, and shook with distress; and, as they brought\nhim towards the sacred relics, a thick, cold dew stood upon his brow, and\nhis features shrank and collapsed. He held back, and exerted himself with\nall his might to escape, foaming at the mouth, and from time to time\nuttering loud shrieks and horrible words, which disturbed, though they\ncould not interrupt, the hymn. His bearers persevered; they brought him\nclose to Callista, and made him touch her feet with his hands. Immediately\nhe screamed fearfully, and was sent up into the air with such force that\nhe seemed discharged from some engine of war: then he fell back upon the\nearth apparently lifeless.\n\nThe long prayer was ended; the _Sursum corda_ was uttered. Juba raised\nhimself from the ground. When the words of consecration had been said, he\nadored with the faithful. After the mass, his attendants came to him; he\nwas quite changed; he was quiet, harmless, and silent: the evil spirit had\ngone out; but he was an idiot.\n\nThis wonderful deliverance was but the beginning of the miracles which\nfollowed the martyrdom of St. Callista. It may be said to have been the\nresurrection of the Church at Sicca. In not many months Decius was killed,\nand the persecution ceased there. Castus was appointed bishop, and numbers\nbegan to pour into the fold. The lapsed asked for peace, or at least such\nblessings as they could have. Heathens sought to be received. When asked\nfor their reason, they could only say that Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and death\nhad affected them with constraining force, and that they could not help\nfollowing her steps. Increasing in boldness, as well as numbers, the\nChristians cowed both magistrates and mob. The spirit of the populace had\nbeen already broken; and the continual change of masters, and measures\nwith them, in the imperial government, inflicted a chronic timidity on the\nmagistracy. A handsome church was soon built, to which Callista\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was\nbrought, and which remained till the time of the Diocletian persecution.\n\nJuba attached himself to this church; and, though he could not be taught\neven to sweep the sacred pavement, still he never was troublesome or\nmischievous. He continued in this state for about ten years. At the end of\nthat time, one morning, after mass, which he always attended in the church\nporch, he suddenly went to the bishop, and asked for baptism. He said that\nCallista had appeared to him, and had restored to him his mind. On\nconversing with him, the holy Castus found that his recovery was beyond\nall doubt: and not knowing how long his lucid state would last, he had no\nhesitation, with such instruction as the time admitted, in administering\nthe sacred rite, as Juba wished. After receiving it, he proceeded to the\ntomb, within which lay St. Callista, and remained on his knees before his\nbenefactress till nightfall. Not even then was he disposed to rise; and so\nhe was left there for the night. Next morning he was found still in the\nattitude of prayer, but lifeless. He had been taken away in his baptismal\nrobe.\n\nAs to Agellius, if he be the bishop of that name who suffered at Sicca in\nhis old age, in the persecution of Diocletian, we are possessed in this\ncircumstance of a most interesting fact to terminate his history withal.\nWhat makes this more likely is, that this bishop is recorded to have\nremoved the body of St. Callista from its original position, and placed it\nunder the high altar, at which he said mass daily. After his own\nmartyrdom, St. Agellius was placed under the high altar also.\n\n\n                                 THE END.\n\n\n                  THE ABERDEEN UNIVERSITY PRESS LIMITED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                FOOTNOTES\n\n\n_    1 Vide_ Oxford transl. of St. Cyprian.\n\n    2 Here is an anachronism, as regards Arnobius and Lactantius of some\n      twenty or thirty years.\n\n    3 Bacon.\n\n\n\n\n\n                            TRANSCRIBER\u00e2\u0080\u0099S NOTE\n\n\nThe author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footnotes have been moved to the end of the volume.\n\nThe following typographical errors were corrected:\n\n      page 10, single quote changed to double quote after \u00e2\u0080\u009cpilum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 34, \u00e2\u0080\u009coff?\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009coff!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 42, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctomatos\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctomatoes\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 69, comma removed after \u00e2\u0080\u009cspirit\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 135, \u00e2\u0080\u009clees\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cless\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 137, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 157, single quote changed to double quote after \u00e2\u0080\u009cstronger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 181, \u00e2\u0080\u009caud\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 201, period changed to question mark after \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarthage\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 207, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthroughont\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthroughout\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 228, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaturu\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaturn\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 230, period added after \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 232, period added after \u00e2\u0080\u009cagain\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 239, \u00e2\u0080\u009cou\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009con\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 240, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009che\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 248, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 255, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 256, \u00e2\u0080\u009cn\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cin\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 263, period changed to comma after \u00e2\u0080\u009csaid\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 278, period changed to question mark after \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 300, period added after \u00e2\u0080\u009cgods\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 303, single quote added after \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 310, quote removed before \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\u00e2\u0080\u009d, added before \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 313, comma changed to period after \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 333, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorrider\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorridor\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 347, comma changed to period after \u00e2\u0080\u009cinitiation\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 348, period added after \u00e2\u0080\u009cvoice\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      page 379, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVariations in spelling (like \u00e2\u0080\u009cjailer\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cjailor\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAsper\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAspar\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPhenician\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cPh\u00c5\u0093nician\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThibursicumber\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThibursicumbur\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and\nhyphenation (e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009cfarm-house\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfarmhouse\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoodwill\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgood-will\u00e2\u0080\u009d) were not changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Callista by John Henry Cardinal Newman\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CALLISTA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30664-h.htm or 30664-h.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/0\/6\/6\/30664\/\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n","id":982,"split":"train"}
