Although she does not do anybody any harm, in the course of the novel Linda is likened to Siberia, described by her husband as a \"woman of alabaster\", and calls herself \"the most sterile woman alive\". Married at 18, she sees herself \"in a place of little importance\" and at the same time \"bound on a journey with a hidden destination\". Linda Condon is dedicated to Carl Van Vechten.Linda Condon is raised by her single mother, who denies the girl any information about her absentee father. Mother and daughter live together in a seemingly endless succession of hotels in various regions of the United States, and Linda receives little formal education. While Stella Condon frequently goes out with men of dubious reputation, her daughter, who is always loyal to her shallow and superficial mother, spends her early adolescent days alone in her hotel room or with other guests in the artificial and phony atmosphere of the lobby. Stella Condon does have a suitor, a self-made millionaire and widower of Jewish descent called Moses Feldt, but she explains to Linda that she is not going to repeat past mistakes by getting married again.\nHowever, when Stella Condon realizes the onset of old age and her vanishing beauty, she consents to a marriage of convenience with Feldt. From one day to the next Linda's itinerant life is replaced by life in a palace-like New York mansion together with her mother, Feldt and his two daughters. Already at the early age of 15 Linda experiences a \"sense of looking on, as if morning, noon and night she were at another long play. [...] Probably it would continue without change through her entire life.\"\nThrough Feldt's daughter Judith and her boyfriend Markue, Linda, not yet 18 years of age, is launched into New York society. At a party she meets Dodge Pleydon, a sculptor many years her senior who is fascinated by the young girl despite, or maybe because of, her frozen charm and subdued behaviour. Her first kiss, which she gets from Pleydon later that night, does not mean a lot to her, so she is hardly moved when he announces his intention to go abroad for an indefinite period of time.\nHer life takes a decisive new direction when, after attending a concert, she is approached by her father's sister, who has recognized her immediately because, as she claims, Linda is taking after her father. Naturally curious to learn more about the paternal branch of her family, Linda accepts her aunt's invitation to visit her and her sister in Philadelphia and to stay in the house where her father, now dead, was raised. Her decision to go there leads to an ever-increasing estrangement from her mother. In Philadelphia, Linda is introduced to her aunts' 45-year-old nephew Arnaud Hallet, a lawyer and confirmed bachelor who immediately falls for the girl just like Pleydon before him. Caught between the two men, who both propose to her, Linda eventually decides to marry Hallet, with the fact that he has \"a hundred thousand dollars a year\" certainly adding to his attraction.\nSeven years later, Arnaud and Linda Hallet have two children, Lowrie and Vign\u00e9. Remembering her own unhappy childhood spent in hotels, Linda realizes how different from herself her children are being brought up. However, she feels inadequate as a wife and especially as a mother. She sees that both Lowrie and Vign\u00e9 have inherited their love of books from their father, while she herself has never taken up reading. Also, she regrets not being able to play the piano. And although she is only in her late twenties, she imagines her beauty is fading without finding solace in the \"vicarious immortality of children\". She believes she has \"lost her youth without any compensating gain of knowledge\".\nSeveral years pass until Lowrie becomes a law student at university. Vign\u00e9 follows in her mother's and maternal grandmother's footsteps by getting married at the age of 18. Linda admires her daughter, who with perfect ease has picked an eligible young man, and whose \"radiant happiness\" is something she has never experienced herself.\nWhen she learns that a public statue created by Pleydon has been destroyed she suddenly feels sympathy and maybe even more for the sculptor, who has always considered her his muse. Considering that Arnaud Hallet has \"had over twenty years of her life, the best\", Linda leaves him without a word to go and live with Pleydon. Once at his studio, she realizes that there is no way she could stay with that ageing, sickly man whose love for her could never be more than platonic. On the following day, she returns to her husband without ever telling him about her intended betrayal.\nAt the end of the novel, three years after her aborted decision to live with Pleydon, her son Lowrie marries a college-educated suffragette while Linda Hallet herself, while grieving over Pleydon's death, starts dyeing her hair in a fruitless struggle against time.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Linda Condon, by Joseph Hergesheimer\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Her eyes were the last thing to remember and wonder\nabout; in shade blue, they had a velvet richness, a poignant intensity\nof lovely color, that surprised the heart. Aside from that she was slim,\nperhaps ten years old, and graver than gay.\n\nHer mother was gay for them both, and, therefore, for the entire family.\nNo father was in evidence; he was dead and never spoken of, and Linda\nwas the only child. Linda's dresses, those significant trivialities,\nplainly showed two tendencies--the gaiety of her mother and her own\nalways formal gravity. If Linda appeared at dinner, in the massive\nRenaissance materialism of the hotel dining-room, with a preposterous\nmagenta hair-ribbon on her shapely head, her mother had succeeded in\nexpressing her sense of the appropriately decorative; while if Linda\nwore an unornamented but equally \"unsuitable\" frock of dark velvet, she,\nin her turn, had been vindicated.\n\nAgain, but far more rarely, the child's selection was evident on the\nwoman. As a rule Mrs. Condon garbed her flamboyant body in large and\nexpensive patterns or extremely tailored suits; and of the two, the\nevening satins and powdered arms barely retaining an admissible line,\nand the suits, the latter were the most, well--spectacular.\n\nShe was not dark in color but brightly golden; a gold, it must be said\nin all honesty, her own, a metallic gold crisply and solidly marcelled;\nwith hazel-brown eyes, and a mouth which, set against her daughter's\ndeep-blue gaze, was her particular attraction. It was rouged to a\nnicety, the under lip a little full and never quite against the upper.\nIf Linda's effect was cool and remote, Mrs. Condon, thanks to her\nmouth, was reassuringly imminent. She was, too, friendly; she talked to\nwomen--in her not overfrequent opportunities--in a rapid warm inaccurate\nconfession of almost everything they desired to hear. The women, of\ncourse, were continually hampered by the unfortunate fact that\nthe questions nearest their hearts, or curiosity, were entirely\ninadmissible.\n\nViewed objectively, they all, with the exception of Linda, seemed alike;\nbut that might have been due to their common impressive setting. The\nBoscombe, in its way, was as lavish as Mrs. Condon's dresses. The main\nplace of congregation, for instance, was a great space of white marble\ncolumns, Turkey-red carpet and growing palms. It was lighted at night\nindirectly by alabaster bowls hanging on gilded chains--a soft bright\nflood of radiance falling on the seated or slowly promenading women with\nbare shoulders.\n\nUsually they were going with a restrained sharp eagerness toward the\ndining-room or leaving it in a more languid flushed repletion. There\nwere, among them, men; but somehow the men never seemed to be of the\nleast account. It was a women's paradise. The glow from above always\nemphasized the gowns, the gowns like orchids and tea-roses and the\nleaves of magnolias. It sparkled in the red and green and crystal\njewels like exotic dew scattered over the exotic human flowers. Very\noccasionally there was a complacent or irritable masculine utterance,\nand then it was immediately lost in the dominant feminine sibilance.\n\nOther children than Linda sped in the manner of brilliant fretful tops\nliterally on the elaborate outskirts of the throng; but they were as\ndifferent from her as she was from the elders. Indeed Linda resembled\nthe latter, rather than her proper age, remarkably. She had an air of\nresponsibility, sometimes expressed in a troubled frown, and again by\nthe way she hurried sedately through drifting figures toward a definite\npurpose and end.\n\nUsually it was in the service of one of her mother's small innumerable\nrequests or necessities; if the latter were sitting with a gentleman on\nthe open hotel promenade that overlooked the sea and needed a heavier\nwrap, Linda returned immediately with a furred cloak on her arm; if the\nelder, going out after dinner, had brought down the wrong gloves, Linda\nknew the exact wanted pair in the long perfumed box; while countless\ntrifles were needed from the convenient drug-store.\n\nThe latter was a place of white mosaic floor and glittering glass, with\na marble counter heaped with vivid fruit and silver-covered bowls of\nsirups and creams with chopped nuts. Linda often found time to stop here\nfor a delectable glass of assorted sweet compounds. She was on terms of\nintimacy with the colored man in a crisp linen coat who presided over\nthe refreshments, and he invariably gave her an extra spoonful of the\nmarron paste she preferred. When at lunch, it might be, she cared for\nvery little, her mother would complain absently:\n\n\"You must stop eating those sickening mixtures. They'd ruin any skin.\"\nAt this she invariably found the diminutive mirror in the bag on her\nlap and glanced at her own slightly improved color. The burden of the\nfeminine conversations in which Mrs. Condon was privileged to join,\nLinda discovered, was directed toward these overwhelming considerations\nof appearance. And their importance, communicated to her, resulted in\na struggle between the desire to preserve her skin from ruin and the\nseductions of marron paste and maple chocolates.\n\nNow, with an uncomfortable sense of impending disaster, she would\nhastily consume one or the other; again, supported by a beginning\nself-imposed inflexibility, she would turn steadily away from\ntemptation. In the end the latter triumphed; and her normal appetite,\nalways moderate, was unimpaired.\n\nThis spirit of resolution, it sometimes happened, was a cause of\nhumorous dismay to her mother. \"I declare, Linda,\" she would observe\nwith an air of helplessness, \"you make me feel like the giddy one and\nas if you were mama. It's the way you look, so disapproving. I have to\nremind myself you're only--just how old are you? I keep forgetting.\"\nLinda would inform her exactly and the other sigh:\n\n\"The years slip around disgustingly. It seems only yesterday I was at\nmy first party.\" Usually, in spite of Linda's eagerness to hear of that\ntime when her mother was a girl, the elder would stop abruptly. On rare\noccasions solitary facts emerged from the recalled existence of a\nsmall town in the country. There were such details as buggy-riding\nand prayer-meetings and excursions to a Boiling Springs where the\ndancing-floor, open among the trees, was splendid. At these memories\nMrs. Condon had been known to cry.\n\nBut she would recover shortly. Her emotions were like that--easily\nroused, highly colored and soon forgotten. She forgot, Linda realized\nleniently, a great deal. It wasn't safe to rely on her promises.\nHowever, if she neglected a particular desire of Linda's, she\ncontinually brought back unexpected gifts of candy, boxes of silk\nstockings, or lovely half-wilted flowers.\n\nThe flowers, they discovered, although they stayed fresh for a long\nwhile pinned to Linda's slim waist, died almost at once if worn by her\nmother. \"It's my warm nature, I am certain,\" the latter proclaimed to\nher daughter; \"while you are a little refrigerator. I must say it's\nwonderful how you keep your clothes the same. Neat as a pin.\" Somehow,\nwith this commendation, she managed to include a slight uncomplimentary\nimpatience. Linda didn't specially want to resemble a pin, a\ndisagreeable object with a sharp point. She considered this in the long\nperiods when, partly by preference, she was alone.\n\nSeated, perhaps, in the elaborate marble and deep red of the Boscombe's\nreception-rooms, isolated in the brilliant expensive throng, she would\nspeculate over what passed in the light of her own special problems. But\nnothing, really, came out to her satisfaction. There was, notably, no\none she might ask. Her mother, approached seriously, declared that Linda\ngave her the creeps; while others made it plain that it was their duty\nto repress the forwardness inevitable from the scandalous neglect of her\nupbringing.\n\nThey, the women of the Boscombe, glancing at their finger-nails stained\nand buffed to a shining pale vermilion, lightly rubbing their rings on\nthe dry palm of a hand, wondered pessimistically within Linda's hearing\nwhat could come out of such an association. That term, she vaguely\ngathered, referred to her mother. The latter evidently interested them\ntremendously; because, she explained, they had no affairs of their\nown to attend to. This was perfectly clear to Linda until Mrs. Condon\nfurther characterized them as \"busy.\"\n\nThe women, stopped by conventions from really satisfactory investigation\nat the source, drew her on occasion into a laboriously light\ninquisition. How long would Linda and her mama stay at the Boscombe? Had\nthey closed their apartment? Where was it? Hadn't Mrs. Condon mentioned\nCleveland? Wasn't Linda lonely with her mama out so much--they even said\nlate--in rolling chairs? Had she ever seen Mr. Jasper before his arrival\nlast week?\n\nNo, of course she hadn't.\n\nHere they exchanged skeptical glances beneath relentlessly pulled\neyebrows. He was really very nice, Mr. Jasper. Linda in a matter-of-fact\nvoice replied that he had given her a twenty-dollar gold piece. Mr.\nJasper was very generous. But perhaps he had rewarded her for being a\ngood little girl and not--not bothering or hanging about. \"Why should\nhe?\" was Linda's just perceptibly impatient response. Then they told her\nto be quiet because they wanted to listen to the music.\n\nThis consisted in studying, through suspended glasses in chased\nplatinum, a discreet programme. At the end of a selection they either\napplauded condescendingly or told each other that they hadn't cared for\nthat last--really too peculiar. Whichever happened, the leader of the\nsmall orchestra, an extravagant Italian with a supple waist, turned and\nbowed repeatedly with a grimacing smile. The music, usually Viennese,\nwas muted and emotional; its strains blended perfectly with the floating\nscents of the women and the faintly perceptible pungent odors of dinner.\nEvery little while a specially insinuating melody became, apparently,\ntangled in the women's breathing, and their breasts, cunningly traced\nand caressed in tulle, would be disturbed.\n\nMrs. Condon applauded more vigorously than was sanctioned by the others'\nnecessity for elegance; the frank clapping of her pink palms never\nfailed to betray a battery of affected and significant surprise in eyes\nlike--polished cold agates. Linda, seated beside her parent, could be\nseen to lay a hand, narrow and blanched and marked by an emerald, on\nthe elder's knee. Her pale fine lips moved rapidly with the shadow of\ntrouble beneath the intense black bang.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't do it so loudly, mother,\" was what she whispered.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe jealously guarded truth was that, by her daughter at least, Mrs.\nCondon was adored. Linda observed that she was not like an ordinary\nmother, but more nearly resembled a youthful companion. Mrs. Condon's\ngaiety was as genuine as her fair hair. Not kept for formal occasion, it\ngot out of bed with her, remained through the considerable difficulties\nof dressing with no maid but Linda, and if the other were not asleep\ncalled a cheerful or funny good night.\n\nTheir rooms were separated by a bath, but Linda was scarcely ever in her\nown--her mother's lovely things, acting like a magnet, constantly drew\nher to their arrangement in the drawers. When the laundry came up, crisp\nand fragile webs heaped on the bed, Linda laid it away in a sort of\nritual. Even with these publicly invisible garments a difference\nof choice existed between the two: Mrs. Condon's preference was for\ninsertions, and Linda's for shadow embroidery and fine shell edges. Mrs.\nCondon, shaking into position a foam of ribbon and lace, would say with\nher gurgle of amusement, \"I want to be ready when I fall down; if I\nfollowed your advice they'd take me for a nun.\"\n\nThis brought out Linda's low clear laugh, the expression of her extreme\nhappiness. It sounded, for an instant, like a chime of small silver\nbells; then died away, leaving the faintest perceptible flush on her\nhealthy pallor. At other times her mother's humor made her vaguely\nuncomfortable, usually after wine or other drinks that left the elder's\nbreath thick and oppressive. Linda failed completely to grasp the\nallusions of this wit but a sharp uneasiness always responded like the\nlingering stale memory of a bad dream.\n\nOnce, at the Boscombe, her mother had been too silly for words: she had\ngiggled and embraced her sweet little girl, torn an expensive veil to\nshreds and dropped a French model hat into the tub. After a distressing\nsickness she had gone to sleep fully dressed, and Linda, unable to move\nor wake her, had sat long beyond dinner into the night, fearful of the\nentrance of the chambermaid.\n\nThe next day Mrs. Condon had been humble with remorse. Men, she said,\nwere too beastly for description. This was not an unusual opinion. Linda\nobserved that she was always condemning men in general and dressing for\nthem in particular. She offered Linda endless advice in an abstracted\nmanner:\n\n\"They're all liars, Lin, and stingy about everything but their pleasure.\nWomen are different but men are all alike. You get sick to death of\nthem! Never bother them when they are smoking a cigar; cigarettes\ndon't matter. Leave the cigarette-smokers alone, anyhow; they're not\nas dependable as the others. A man with a good cigar--you must know\nthe good from the bad--is usually discreet. I ought to bring you up\ndifferent, but, Lord, life's too short. Besides, you will learn more\nuseful things right with mama, whose eyes are open, than anywhere else.\n\n\"Powder my back, darling; I can't reach. If I'm a little late to-night\ngo to sleep like a duck. You think Mr. Jasper's nice, don't you? So does\nmother. But you mustn't let him give you any more money. It'll make him\nconceited.\"\n\nLinda wondered what she meant by the last phrase. How could it make Mr.\nJasper conceited to give her a gold piece? However, she decided that she\nhad better not ask.\n\nIt was like that with a great many of her mother's mysterious\nremarks--Linda had an instinctive feeling of drawing away. The other\nkissed her warmly and left a print of vivid red on her cheek.\n\nShe examined the mark in the mirror when her mother had gone; it was,\nshe decided, the kiss made visible. Then she laid away the things\nscattered about the room by Mrs. Condon's hasty dressing. Her own\nbelongings were always in precise order.\n\nA sudden hesitation seized her at the thought of going down to the crowd\nat the music. The women made her uncomfortable. It wasn't what they\nsaid, but the way they said it; and the endless questions wearied her.\nShe was, as well, continually bothered by her inability to impress upon\nthem how splendid her mother was. Some of them she was certain did not\nappreciate her. Mrs. Condon at once admitted and was entertained by\nthis, but it disturbed Linda. However, she understood the reason--when\nany nice men came along they always liked her mother best. This made the\nwomen mad.\n\nThe world, she gathered, was a place where women played a game of men\nwith each other. It was very difficult, she couldn't comprehend the\nrules or reason; and Linda was afraid that she would be unsuccessful\nand never have the perfect time her mother wanted for her. In the first\nplace, she was too thin, and then she knew that she could never talk\nlike her dearest. Perhaps when she had had some wine it would be\ndifferent.\n\nShe decided, after all, to go down to the assemblage; and, by one of\nthe white marble pillars, Mrs. Randall captured her. \"Why, here's\nLinda-all-alone,\" Mrs. Randall said. \"Mama out again?\" Linda replied\nstoutly, \"She has a dreadful lot of invitations.\"\n\nMrs. Randall, who wore much brighter clothes than her mother, was called\nby the latter an old buzzard. She was very old, Linda could see, with\nperfectly useless staring patches of paint on her wrinkled cheeks, and\neyes that look as though they might come right out of her head. Her\nfrizzled hair supported a dead false twist with a glittering diamond\npin, and her soft cold hands were loaded with jewels. She frightened\nLinda, really, although she could not say why. Mrs. Randall was a great\ndeal like the witch in a fairy-story, but that wasn't it. Linda hadn't\nthe belief in witches necessary for dread. It might be her scratching\nvoice; or the way she turned her head, without any chin at all, like a\nturtle; or her dresses, which led you to expect a person very different\nfrom an old buzzard.\n\n\"Of course she does,\" said Mrs. Randall, \"any number of invitations, and\nwhy shouldn't she? Your mother is very pleasant, to be sure.\" She nodded\nwisely to the woman beside her, Miss Skillern.\n\nMiss Skillern was short and broad and, in the evening, always wore\ncurled ostrich plumes on tightly filled gray puffs. She reminded Linda\nof a wadded chair. Mrs. Randall, after the other's slight stiff assent,\ncontinued:\n\n\"Your mama would never be lonely, not she. All I wonder is she doesn't\nget married again--with that blondine of hers. Wouldn't you rather have\none papa than, in a way of speaking, a different one at every hotel?\"\n\nLinda, completely at a loss for answer, studied Mrs. Randall with her\ndirect deep blue gaze. Miss Skillern again inclined her plumes. With the\nrest of her immobile she was surprisingly like one of those fat china\nfigures with a nodding head. Linda was assaulted by the familiar\nbewildered feeling of not understanding what was said and, at the same\ntime, passionately resenting it from an inner sensitive recognition of\nsomething wrong.\n\n\"How could I have that?\" she finally asked.\n\n\"How?\" repeated Miss Skillern, breathing loudly.\n\n\"Yes, how?\" Mrs. Randall echoed. \"You can ask your mama. You really can.\nAnd you may say that, as a matter of fact, the question came from us,\"\nshe included her companion.\n\n\"From you,\" Miss Skillern exactly corrected her.\n\n\"Indeed,\" the other cried heatedly, \"from me! I think not. Didn't you\nask? Answer me that, if you please. I heard you with my own ears say,\n'How?' While now, before my face, you try to deny it.\" It was plain to\nLinda that Miss Skillern was totally unmoved by the charge. She moved\nher lorgnette up, gazing stolidly at the musical programme. \"From you,\"\nshe said again, after a little. Mrs. Randall suddenly regained her\nequilibrium.\n\n\"If the ladies of this hotel are afraid to face that creature I--I--am\nnot. I'll tell her in a minute what a respectable person thinks of\nher goings-on. More than that, I shall complain to Mr. Rennert. 'Mr.\nRennert,' I'll say, 'either she leaves or me. Choose as you will. The\nreputation of your hotel--'\" she spluttered and paused.\n\n\"Proof,\" Miss Skillern pronounced judicially; \"proof. We know, but\nthat's not proof.\"\n\n\"He has a wife,\" Mrs. Randall replied in a shrill whisper; \"a wife\nwho is an invalid. Mrs. Zoock, she who had St. Vitus' dance and left\nyesterday, heard it direct. George A. Jasper, woolen mills in Frankford,\nPennsylvania. Mr. Rennert would thank me for that information.\"\n\nThey had forgotten Linda. She stood rigid and cold--they were blaming\nher mother for going out in a rolling chair with Mr. Jasper because he\nwas married. But her mother didn't know that; probably Mr. Jasper had\nnot given it a thought. She was at the point of making this clear, when\nit seemed to her that it might be better to say that her mother knew\neverything there was about Mr. Jasper's wife; she could even add that\nthey were all friends.\n\nLinda would have to tell her mother the second she came in, and then,\nof course, she'd stop going with Mr. Jasper. Men, she thought in the\nelder's phrase, were too beastly for words.\n\n\"After all,\" Mrs. Randall was addressing her again, \"you needn't say\nanything at all to your mama. It might make her so cross that she'd\nspank you.\"\n\n\"Mother never spanks me,\" Linda replied with dignity.\n\n\"If you were my little girl,\" said Miss Skillern, with rolling lips,\n\"I'd put you over my knee with your skirts up and paddle you.\"\n\nNever, Linda thought, had she heard anything worse; she was profoundly\nshocked. The vision of Miss Skillern performing such an operation as\nshe had described cut its horror on her mind. There was a sinking at her\nheart and a misty threat of tears.\n\nTo avert this she walked slowly away. It was hardly past nine o'clock;\nher mother wouldn't be back for a long while, and she was too restless\nand unhappy to sit quietly above. Instead, she continued down to the\nfloor where there were various games in the corridor leading to the\nbilliard-room. The hall was dull, no one was clicking the balls about\nthe green tables, and a solitary sick-looking man, with inky shadows\nunder fixed eyes, was smoking a cigarette in a chair across from the\ncigar-stand.\n\nHe looked over a thick magazine in a chocolate cover, his gaze arrested\nby her irresolute passage. \"Hello, Bellina,\" he said.\n\nShe stopped. \"Linda,\" she corrected him, \"Linda Condon.\" Obeying a\nsudden impulse, she dropped, with a sigh, into a place beside him.\n\n\"You're bored,\" he went on, the magazine put away. \"So am I, but my term\nis short.\"\n\nShe wondered, principally, what he was doing, among so many women, at\nthe Boscombe. He was different from Mr. Jasper, or the other men with\nfat stomachs, the old men with dragging feet. It embarrassed her to meet\nhis gaze, it was so--so investigating. She guessed he was by the sea\nbecause he felt as badly as he looked. He asked surprisingly:\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"On the account of my mother,\" she explained. \"But it doesn't matter\nmuch where I am. Places are all alike,\" she continued conversationally.\n\"We're mostly at hotels--Florida in winter and Lake George in summer.\nThis is kind of between.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he said; and she was sure, from that short single exclamation, he\nunderstood everything.\n\n\"Like all true beauty,\" he added, \"it's plain that you are durable.\"\n\n\"I don't like the seashore,\" she went on easily; \"I'd rather be in a\ngarden with piles of flowers and a big hedge.\"\n\n\"Have you ever lived in a garden-close?\"\n\n\"No,\" she admitted; \"it's just an idea. I told mother but she laughed at\nme and said a roof-garden was her choice.\"\n\n\"Some day you'll have the place you describe,\" he assured her. \"It is\nwritten all over you. I would like to see you, Bellina, in a space\nof emerald sod and geraniums.\" She decided to accept without further\nprotest his name for her. \"You are right, too, about the hedge--the\nhighest and thickest in creation. I should recommend a pseudo-classic\nhouse, Georgian, rather small, a white fa\u00c3\u00a7ade against the grass. A\nJacobean dining-room, dark certainly, the French windows open on dipping\ncandle flames. You'd wear white, with your hair low and the midnight\nbang as it is now.\"\n\n\"That would be awfully nice,\" Linda replied vaguely. She sighed.\n\n\"But a very light drawing-room!\" he cried. \"White panels and arches and\nCanton-blue rugs--the brothers Adam. A fluted mantel, McIntires, and a\nbrass hod. Curiously enough, I always see you in the evening ... at the\npiano. I'm not so bored, now.\" Little flames of red burned in either\nthin cheek. \"What nonsense!\" Suddenly he was tired. \"This is a practical\nand earnest world,\" his voice grew thin and hurt her. \"Yet beauty is\nrelentless. You'll have your garden, but I shouldn't be surprised at\ndifficulties first.\"\n\n\"It won't be so hard to get,\" she declared confidently. \"I mean to\nchoose the right man. Mother says that's the answer. Women, she says,\nwon't use their senses.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nLinda began to think this was a most unpleasant monosyllable.\n\n\"So that's the lay! Has she succeeded?\"\n\n\"She has a splendid time. She's out tonight with Mr. Jasper in a rolling\nchair, and he has loads and loads of money. It makes all the other women\ncross.\"\n\n\"Here you are, then, till she gets back?\"\n\n\"There's no one else.\"\n\n\"But, as a parent, infinitely preferable to the righteous,\" he murmured.\n\"And you--\"\n\n\"I think mother's perfect,\" she answered simply.\n\nHe shook his head. \"You won't succeed at it, though. Your mother, for\nexample, isn't dark.\"\n\n\"The loveliest gold hair,\" she said ecstatically. \"She's much much\nprettier than I'll ever be.\"\n\n\"Prettier, yes. The trouble is, you are lovely, magical. You will stay\nfor a lifetime in the memory. The merest touch of you will be more\npotent than any duty or fidelity. A man's only salvation will be his\nblindness.\"\n\nAlthough she didn't understand a word of this, Linda liked to hear\nhim; he was talking as though she were grown up, and in response to the\nflattery she was magnetic and eager.\n\n\"One time,\" he said, \"very long ago, beauty was worshiped. Men, you\nsee, know better now. They want their dollar's worth. The world was\nabsolutely different then--there were deep adventurous forests with holy\nchapels in the green combe for an orison, and hermits rising to Paradise\non the _Te Deum Laudamus_ of the angels and archangels. There were black\ncastles and, in the broad meadows, silk tents with ivory pegs and poles\nof gold.\n\n\"The enchantments were as thick as shadows under the trees: perhaps the\nloveliest of women riding a snow-white mule, with a saddle cloth of red\nsamite, or, wrapped in her shining hair, on a leopard with yellow eyes,\nlured you to a pavilion, scattered with rushes and flowers and magical\nherbs, and a shameful end. Or a silver doe would weep, begging you to\npierce her with your sword, and, when you did, there knelt the daughter\nof the King of Wales.\n\n\"But I started to tell you about the worship of beauty. Plato started it\nalthough Cardinal Pietro Bembo was responsible for the creed. He lived\nin Italy, in an age like a lily. It developed mostly at Florence in\nthe Platonic Academy of Cosomo and Pico della Mirandola. Love was the\nsupreme force, and its greatest expression a desire beyond the body.\"\n\nHe gazed at Linda with a quizzical light in his eyes deep in shadow.\n\n\"Love,\" he said again, and then paused. \"One set of words will do\nas well as another. You will understand, or not, with something far\ndifferent from intellectual comprehension. The endless service of\nbeauty. Of course, a woman--but never the animal; the spirit always.\nBorn in the spirit, served in the spirit, ending in the spirit. A direct\ncontradiction, you see, to nature and common sense, frugality and the\nsacred symbol of the dollar.\n\n\"It wouldn't please your Mr. Jasper, with his heaps and heaps of money.\nMr. Jasper would consider himself sold. But Novalis, not so very long\nago, understood.... A dead girl more real than all earth. You mustn't\nsuppose it to be mere mysticism.\"\n\nLinda said, \"Very well, I won't.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"No one could call Michelangelo hysterical. Sometime in the\nhistory of man, of a salt solution, this divinity has touched them.\nTouched them hopefully, and perhaps gone--banished by the other\ndestination. Or I can comprehend nature killing it relentlessly, since\nit didn't lead to propagation. Then, too, as much as was useful was\nturned into a dogma for politics and priests.\n\n\"You saw in the rushlight a woman against the arras; there was a\nhumming of viola d'amore from the musicians' balcony; she smiled at you,\nlingering, and then vanished with a whisper of brocade de Lyons on a\nsanded floor. Nothing else but a soft white glove, eternally fragrant,\nin your habergeon, an eternally fragrant memory; the dim vision in stone\nstreet and coppice; a word, a message, it might be, sent across the\nworld of steel at death. And then, in the last flicker of vision, the\narras and the clear insistent strings, the whispering brocade de Lyons\non the landing.\n\n\"The philosophy of it,\" he said in a different tone, \"is exact, even\na scientific truth. But men have been more concerned with turning lead\ninto gold; naturally the spirit has been neglected. The science of love\nhas been incredibly soiled:\n\n\"The old gesture toward the stars, the bridge of perfection, the escape\nfrom the fatality of flesh. Yet it was a service of the body made\nincredibly lovely in actuality and still never to be grasped. Never to\nbe won. It ought to be clear to you that realized it would diminish into\nquite a different thing--\n\n\"'_La figlia della sua mente, l'amorosa idea._'\"\n\nHis voice grew so faint that Linda could scarcely distinguish articulate\nsounds. All that he said, without meaning for her, stirred her heart.\nShe was used to elder enigmas of speech; her normal response was\ninstinctively emotional, and nothing detracted from the gravity of her\nattention.\n\n\"Not in pious men,\" he continued, more uncertain; \"nor in seminaries of\nvirtue. They have their reward. But in men whose bitterness of longing\ngrew out of hideous fault. The distinction of beauty--not a payment for\nprayers or chastity. The distinction of love ... above chests of linen\nand a banker's talent and patents of nobility.... Divine need. Idiotic.\nBut what else, what better, offers?\"\n\nHe was, she saw, terribly sick. His hands were clenched and his entire\nbeing strained and rigid, as though he were trying to do something\ntremendously difficult. At last, with infinite pain, he succeeded.\n\n\"I must get away,\" he articulated.\n\nLinda was surprised at the effort necessary for this slight\naccomplishment when he had said the most bewildering things with\ncomplete ease. Well, the elevators were right in front of him. He rose\nslowly, and, with Linda standing at his side, dug a sharp hand into her\nshoulder. It hurt, but instinctively she bore it and, moving forward,\npartly supported him. She pressed the bell that signaled for the\nelevator and it almost immediately sank into view. \"Hurry,\" he said\nharshly to the colored operator in a green uniform; and quite suddenly,\nleaving a sense of profound mystery, he disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nLinda decided that he had told her a rather stupid fairy story. She was\ntoo old for such ridiculous things as ladies in their shining hair on a\nleopard. She remembered clearly seeing one of the latter at a zoological\ngarden. It had yellow eyes, but no one would care to ride on it. Her\nmother, she was certain, knew more about love than any man. His words\nfaded quickly from her memory, but a confused rich sense stirred her\nheart, a feeling such as she experienced after an unusually happy day:\nwhite gloves and music and Mr. Jasper displeased.\n\nA clock chimed ten, and she proceeded to her mother's room, where she\nmust wait up with her information about Mr. Jasper's wife. She was\nfurious at him for a carelessness that had brought her mother such\nunfavorable criticism. Everything had been put away before going down,\nand there was nothing for her to do. The time dragged tediously. The\nhands of the traveling-clock in purple leather on the dressing-table\nmoved deliberately around to eleven. A ringing of ice in one of the\nmetal pitchers carried by the bell boys sounded from the corridor. There\nwas the faint wail of a baby.\n\nSuddenly and acutely Linda was lonely--a new kind of loneliness that had\nnothing to do with the fact that she was by herself. It was a strange\ncold unhappiness, pressing over her like a cloud and, at the same time,\nit was nothing at all. That is, there was no reason for it. The room was\nbrightly lighted and, anyhow, she wasn't afraid of \"things.\" She thought\nthat at any minute she must cry like that baby. After a little she felt\nbetter; rather the unhappiness changed to wanting. What she wanted was\na puzzle; but nothing else would satisfy her. It might be a necklace of\nlittle pearls, but it wasn't. It might be--. Now it was twelve o'clock.\nDear, dear, why didn't she come back!\n\nMusic, awfully faint, and a whisper, like a dress, across the floor.\nHer emotion changed again, to an extraordinary delight, a glow like that\nwhich filled her at the expression of her adoration for her mother, but\ninfinitely greater. She was seated, and she lifted her head with her\neyes closed and hands clasped. The clock pointed to one and her parent\ncame into the room.\n\n\"Linda,\" she exclaimed crossly, \"whatever are you doing up? A bad little\ngirl. I told you to be asleep hours before this.\"\n\n\"There is something you had to know right away,\" Linda informed her\nsolemnly. \"I only just heard it from Mrs. Randall and Miss Skillern.\"\nHer mother's flushed face hardened. \"Mr. Jasper is married,\" Linda said.\n\nMrs. Condon dropped with an angry flounce into a chair. Her broad scarf\nof sealskin slipped from one shoulder. Her hat was crooked and her hair\ndisarranged. \"So that's it,\" she said bitterly; \"and they went to you.\nThe dam' old foxes. They went to you, nothing more than a child.\"\n\nLinda put in, \"They didn't mean to; it just sort of came out. I knew\nyou'd stop as soon as you heard. Wasn't it horrid of him?\"\n\n\"And this,\" Mrs. Condon declared, \"is what I get for being, yes--proper.\n\n\"I said to-night, 'George,' I said, 'go right back home. It's the only\nthing. They have a right to you.' I told him that only to-night. And,\n'No, I must consider my little Linda.' If I had held up my finger,\"\nshe held up a finger to show the smallness of the act necessary, \"where\nwould we have all been?\n\n\"But this is what I get. You might think the world would notice a\nwoman's best efforts. No, they all try to crowd her and see her slip. If\nthey don't watch out I'll skid, all right, and with some one they least\nexpect. I have opportunities.\"\n\nLinda realized with a sense of confusion that her mother had known of\nMr. Jasper's marriage all the while. But she had nobly tried to save him\nfrom something; just what Linda couldn't make out. The other's breath\nwas heavy with drinking.\n\n\"You go to bed, Lin,\" she continued; \"and thank you for taking care of\nmama. I hope to goodness you'll learn from all this--pick out what\nyou want and make for it. Don't bother with the antique frumps, the\ndisappointed old tabbies. Have your fun. There's nothing else. If you\nlike a man, be on the level with him--give and take. Men are not saints\nand we're better for it; we don't live in a heaven. You've got a sweet\nlittle figure. Always remember mama telling you that the most expensive\ncorsets are the cheapest in the end.\"\n\nLinda undressed slowly and methodically, her mother's words ringing\nin her head. Always remember--but of course she would have the nicest\nthings possible.... A keepsake and faint music. She thought, privately,\nthat she was too thin; she'd rather be her mother, with shoulders like\nbunches of smooth pink roses. In bed, just as she was falling asleep, a\nsound disturbed her from the corridor above--the slow tramping of heavy\nfeet, like a number of men carefully bearing an awkward object. She\nlistened with suspended breath while they passed. The footfalls seemed\nto pound on her heart. Slowly, slowly they went, unnatural and measured.\nThey were gone now, but she still heard them. The crashing of her mother\ninto bed followed with a deep sigh. The long fall of a wave on the shore\nwas audible. Two things contended in her stilled brain--the mysterious\nfeeling of desire and her mother's advice. They were separate and\nfought, yet they were strangely incomprehensibly joined.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIn the morning Mrs. Condon, with a very late breakfast-tray in bed, had\nregained her usual cheerful manner. \"The truth is,\" she told Linda, \"I'm\nglad that Jasper man has gone. He had no idea of discretion; tired of\nthem anyhow.\" Linda radiated happiness. This was the mother she loved\nabove all others. Her mind turned a little to the man who had talked to\nher the night before. She wondered if he were better. His thin blanched\nface, his eyes gleaming uncomfortably in smudges, recurred to her.\nPerhaps he'd be down by the cigar-stand again. She went, presently, to\nsee, but the row of chairs was empty.\n\nHowever, the neglected thick brown-covered magazine was still on the\nledge by which he had been sitting. There was a name on it, and while,\nordinarily, she couldn't read handwriting, this was so clear and\nregular, but minutely small, that she was able to spell it out--Howard\nWelles.\n\nIt disappointed her not to find him; at lunch she observed nearly every\none present, but still he was lost. He wasn't listening to the music\nafter dinner, nor below. A deep sense of disappointment grew within her.\nLinda wanted to see him, hear him talk; at times a sharp hurt in the\nshoulder he had grasped brought him back vividly. The next day it was\nthe same, and finally, diffidently, she approached the hotel desk. A\nclerk she knew, Mr. Fiske, was rapidly sorting mail, and she waited\npolitely until he had finished.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"I found this down-stairs,\" she said, giving him the magazine. \"Perhaps\nhe'll want it.\" Mr. Fiske looked at the written name, and then glanced\nsharply at her. \"No,\" he told her brusquely, \"he won't want it.\" He\nturned away with the magazine and left Linda standing irresolutely. She\nwanted to ask if Mr. Welles were still at the Boscombe; if the latter\ndidn't want the magazine she'd love to have it, Linda couldn't tell why.\nBut the clerk went into the treasurer's office and she was forced to\nmove away.\n\nLater, lingering inexplicably about the spot where she had heard so\nmany bewildering words, a very different man spoke to her. He, Linda\nobserved, was smoking a cigar, a good one, she was certain. He was\nsmallish and had a short bristling mustache and head partly bald.\nHis shoes were very shiny and altogether he had a look of prosperity.\n\"Hello, cutie!\" he cried, capturing her arm. She responded listlessly.\nThe other produced a crisp dollar bill. \"Do you see the chocolates in\nthat case?\" he said, indicating the cigar-stand. \"Well, get the best. If\nthey cost more, let me know. Our financial rating is number one.\" Linda\nanswered that she didn't think she cared for any. \"All right,\" the man\nagreed; \"sink the note in the First National Ladies Bank, if you know\nwhere that is.\"\n\nHe engineered her unwillingly onto a knee. \"How's papa?\" he demanded. \"I\nsuppose he will be here Saturday to take his family through the stores?\"\n\nShe replied with dignity, \"There is only my mother and me.\"\n\nAt this information he exclaimed \"Ah!\" and touched his mustache with a\ndiminutive gold-backed brush from a leather case. \"That's more than I\nhave,\" he confided to her; \"there is only myself. Isn't that sad? You\nmust be sorry for the lonely old boy.\"\n\nShe wasn't. Probably he, too, had a wife somewhere; men were beastly. \"I\nguess your mother wants a little company at times herself?\"\n\nLinda, straining away from him, replied, \"Oh, dear, no; there are just\npacks of gentlemen whenever she likes. But she is tired of them all.\"\nShe escaped and he settled his waistcoat.\n\n\"You mustn't run away,\" he admonished her; \"nice children don't. Your\nmother didn't bring you up like that, I'm sure. She wouldn't like it.\"\n\nLinda hesitated, plainly conveying the fact that, if she were to wait,\nhe would have to say something really important.\n\n\"Just you two,\" he deliberated; \"Miss and Mrs. Jones.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Linda asserted shortly; \"our name is Condon.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you'd tell her this,\" he went on: \"a gentleman's here by\nhimself named Bardwell, who has seen her and admires her a whole lot.\nTell her he's no young sprig but he likes a good time all the better.\nDependable, too. Remember that, cutie. And he wouldn't presume if he had\na short pocket. He knows class when he sees it.\"\n\n\"It won't do any good,\" Linda assured him in her gravest manner. \"She\nsaid only this morning she was sick of them.\"\n\n\"That was before dinner,\" he replied cheerfully. \"Things look different\nlater in the day. You do what I tell you.\"\n\nAll this Linda dutifully repeated. Her mother was at the dressing-table,\nrubbing cream into her cheeks, and she paused, surveying her reflection\nin the mirror. \"He was smoking a big cigar,\" Linda added. The other\nlaughed. \"What a sharp little thing you are!\" she exclaimed. \"A body\nought to be careful what they tell you.\" She wiped off the cream and\nrubbed a soft pinkish powder into her skin.\n\n\"He saw me, did he?\" she apparently addressed the glass. \"Admired me a\nwhole lot. Was he nice, Linda?\" she turned. \"Were his clothes right? You\nmust point him out to me to-night. But do it carefully, darling. No one\nshould notice. Your mother isn't on the shelf yet; she can hold her own,\neven in the Boscombe, against the whole barnyard.\"\n\nLinda, at the entrance to the dining-room, whispered, \"There he is.\" But\nimmediately Mr. Bardwell was smiling and speaking to them.\n\n\"I had a delightful conversation with your little girl to-day,\" he told\nMrs. Condon; \"such a pretty child and well brought up.\"\n\n\"And good, too,\" her mother replied; \"not a minute's trouble. The common\nsense of the grown; you'd never believe it.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I?\" he protested gallantly. \"Every reason to.\" Mrs.\nCondon blushed becomingly.\n\n\"She had to make up for a lot,\" she sighed.\n\nAn hour or more after dinner Mrs. Randall stopped Linda in the hall\nbeyond the music. \"Mama out?\" she inquired brightly. \"I thought Mr.\nJasper left this morning?\"\n\nLinda told her that Mr. Jasper had gone; she added nothing else.\n\n\"I must look at the register,\" Mrs. Randall continued; \"I really must.\"\n\nObeying an uncontrollable impulse Linda half cried, \"I'd like to see you\nriding on a leopard!\" A flood of misery enveloped her, and she hurried\nup to the silence of her mother's deserted room.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nIt was on her fourteenth birthday that Linda noticed a decided change\nin her mother; a change, unfortunately, that most of all affected\nthe celebrated good humors. In the first place Mrs. Condon spent\nan increasingly large part of the day before the mirror of her\ndressing-table, but without any proportionate pleasure; or, if there\nwas a proportion kept, it exhibited the negative result of a growing\nannoyance. \"God knows why they all show at once,\" she exclaimed\ndiscontentedly, seated--as customary--before the eminently truthful\nreflection of a newly discovered set of lines. \"I'm not old enough to\nbegin to look like a hag.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother,\" Linda protested, shocked, \"you mustn't say such horrid\nthings about yourself. Why, you're perfectly lovely, and you don't seem\na speck older than you did years ago.\"\n\nThe other, biting her full underlip at the unwelcome fact in turn biting\na full lower lip back at her, made no reply. Linda lingered for a moment\nat her mother's ruffled pink shoulders; then, with a sigh, she turned to\nthe reception-room of their small suite at the Hotel Gontram. It was a\nsomber chamber furnished in red plush, with a complication of shades and\ngray-white net curtains at long windows and a deep green carpet. There\nwas a fireplace, with a grate, supported by varnished oak pillars and\nelaborate mantel and glass, a glittering reddish center-table with a\ngreat many small odd shelves below, a desk with sheaves of hotel writing\npaper and the telephone.\n\nThe Gontram was entirely different from the hotels at the lakes or\nseashore or in the South. It was a solid part of a short block west of\nFifth Avenue in the middle of the city. Sherry's filled a corner with\nits massive stone bulk and glimpses of dining-rooms with glittering\nchandeliers and solemn gaiety, then impressive clubs and wide entrances\nunder heavy glass and metal, tall porters in splendid livery, succeeded\neach other to the Hotel Gontram and the dull thunder of the elevated\ntrains beyond.\n\nThe revolving door, through which Linda sedately permitted herself to\nbe moved, opened into a high space of numerous columns and benches,\nwriting-desks and palms. At the back was the white room where, usually\nalone, she had breakfast, while the dining-room, discreetly lighted,\nwas at the left. It was more interesting here than, for example, at\nthe Boscombe; people were always coming in or going, and there were\nquantities of men. She watched them arriving with shoals of leather bags\nin the brisk care of the bellboys, disappear into the elevator, and, if\nit was evening, come down in dinner coats with vivid silk scarfs folded\nover their white shirts.\n\nThe women were perpetually in street clothes or muffled in satin wraps;\nLinda only regarded them when they were exceptional. Usually she was\nintent on the men. It often happened that they returned her frank gaze\nwith a smile, or stopped to converse with her. Sometimes it was an actor\nwith a face dryly pink like a woman's from make-up; they were familiar\nand pinched her cheeks, calling her endearing names in conscious echoing\nvoices as if they were quite hollow within. Then there were simply\nbusiness men, who never appeared to take off their derby hats, and spoke\nto her of their little girls at home. She was entirely at ease with the\nlatter--so many of her mother's friends were similar--and critically\nvalued the details of their dress, the cigar-cases with or without gold\ncorners, the watch-chains with jeweled insignia, the cuff-links and\nembroidered handkerchiefs.\n\nIf her mother approached while Linda was so engaged the elder would\nlinger with a faint smile, at which, now, the girl was conscious of a\ngrowing impatience. She'd rise with dignity and, if possible, escape\nwith her parent from florid courtesies. This sense of annoyance\noppressed her, too, in the dining-room, where her mother, a cocktail in\nher hand, would engage in long cheerful discussions with the captains or\nwaiters. Other women, Linda observed, spoke with complete indifference\nand their attention on the _carte de jour_. Of course it was much more\nfriendly to be interested in the servants' affairs--they told her mother\nabout their wives and the number of their children, the difficulties of\nbringing both ends together, and served her with the promptest care; but\ninstinctively Linda avoided any but the most formal contact.\n\nShe had to insist, as well, on paying the tips; for Mrs. Condon, her\nsympathies engaged, was quite apt to leave on the table a five-dollar\nbill or an indiscriminate heap of silver. \"You are a regular little\nJew,\" she would reply lightly to Linda's protests. This, the latter\nthought, was unfair; for the only Jew she knew, Mr. Moses Feldt, an\nacquaintance of their present period in New York, was quite the most\ngenerous person she knew. \"Certainly you don't take after your mama.\"\n\nAfter she said this she always paused with tight lips. It was charged\nwith the assumption that, while Linda didn't resemble her, she did\nvery much a mysterious and unfavorably regarded personage. Her father,\nprobably. More and more Linda wondered about him. He was dead, she knew,\nbut that, she began to see, was no reason for the positive prohibition\nto mention him at all. Perhaps he had done something dreadful, with\nmoney, and had disgraced them all. Yet she was convinced that this was\nnot so.\n\nShe had heard a great many uncomplimentary words applied to husbands,\nmost of which she had been unable to comprehend; and she speculated\nblankly on them in her mother's connection. On the whole the women\nagreed that they were remarkably stupid and transparent, they protested\nthat they understood and guided every move husbands made; and this\nsurely gave her father no opportunity for independent crime. She was\nheld from questioning not so much by her mother's command--at times she\ncalmly and successfully ignored that--as from its unfortunate effect on\nthe elder.\n\nMrs. Condon would burn with a generalized anger that sank to a\ndespondency fortified by the brandy flask. Straining embraces and tears,\npainful to support, would follow, or more unbearable silliness. The old\ndifficulties with giggling or sympathetic chambermaid;--Linda couldn't\ndecide which was worse--then confronted her with the necessity for rigid\nlies, misery, and the procuring of sums of money from the bag in the\ntop drawer. Altogether, and specially with the fresh difficulties of\nher mother's unaccountable irritation and apprehensions, things were\nfrightfully complicated.\n\nIt was late afternoon in November, and the electric lights were on;\nhowever, they were lighted when they rose, whenever they were in the\nrooms, for it was always gloomy if not positively dark; the bedroom\nlooked into a deep exterior well and the windows of the other chamber\nopened on an uncompromising blank wall. Yet Linda, now widely learned in\nsuch settings, rather liked her present situation. They had occupied the\nsame suite before, for one thing; and going back into it had given her a\nsense of familiarity in so much that always shifted.\n\nLinda, personally, had changed very little; she was taller than four\nyears before, but not a great deal; she was, perhaps, more graceful--her\nmovements had become less sudden--more assured, the rapidly maturing\nqualities of her mind made visible; and she had gained a surprising\nrepose.\n\nNow, for example, she sat in a huge chair cushioned with black leather\nand thought, with a frowning brow, of her mother. It was clear that the\nlatter was obviously worried about--to put it frankly--her face. Her\nfigure, she repeatedly asserted, could be reasoned with; she had always\nbeen reconciled to a certain jolly stoutness, but her face, the\nlines that appeared about her eyes overnight, fairly drove her to hot\nindiscreet tears. She had been to see about it, Linda knew; and returned\nfrom numerous beauty-parlors marvelously rejuvenated--for the evening.\n\nShe had been painted, enameled, vibrated, massaged; she had had electric\ntreatment, rays and tissue builders; and once she had been baked. To-day\nthe toilet table would be loaded with milkweed, cerates and vanishing\ncream; tomorrow they would all be swept away, given to delighted\nchambermaids, while Mrs. Condon declared that, when all was said, cold\nwater and a rough towel was nature's way.\n\nThis afternoon, apparently everything, including hope, had failed. She\nwas as cross as cross. From the manner in which she spoke it might have\nbeen Linda's fault. The worst of it was that even the latter saw that\nnothing could be done. Her mother was growing--well, a little tired in\nappearance. Swift tears gathered in Linda's eyes. She hadn't been quite\ntruthful in that reassuring speech of hers. She set herself to the\nexamination of various older women with whom she had more or less lately\ncome in contact. How had they regarded and met the loss of whatever good\nlooks they had possessed?\n\nIt was terribly mixed up, but, as she thought about it, it seemed to her\nthat the world of women was divided into two entirely different groups,\nthe ones men liked, and who had such splendid parties; and the ones\nwho sat together and gossiped in sharp lowered voices. She hoped\npassionately that her mother would not become one of the latter for a\nlong long while. But eventually it seemed that there was no escape\nfrom the circle of brilliantly dressed creatures with ruined faces who\ncongregated in the hotels and whispered and nodded in company until they\nwent severally to bed.\n\nThe great difference between one and the other, of course, was the favor\nof men. Their world revolved about that overwhelming fact. Her mother\nhad informed her of this on a hundred occasions and in countless ways;\nbut more by her actions, her present wretchedness, than by speech. It\nwas perfectly clear to Linda that nothing else mattered. She was even\nbeginning, in a vague way, to think of it in connection with herself;\nbut still most of her preoccupation was in her mother. She decided\ngravely that a great deal, yet, could be done. For instance, lunch\nto-day:\n\nHer mother had given her a birthday celebration at Henri's, the famous\nconfectioner but a door or two from their hotel, and at the end, when\na plate of the most amazing and delightful little cakes had been set on\nthe table, the elder had eaten more than half. Afterwards she had sworn\nruefully at her lack of character, begging Linda--in a momentary return\nof former happy companionship--never to let her make such a silly pig\nof herself again. Then she got so tired, Linda continued her mental\ndeliberations; if she could only rest, go away from cities and resorts\nfor a number of months, the lines in turn would soon vanish.\n\nThe elder moved impatiently, with a fretful exclamation, in the inner\nroom; from outside came the subdued dull ceaseless clamor of New York.\nFormerly it had frightened Linda; but her dread had become a wordless\nexcitement at the thought of so much just beyond the windows; her hands\ngrew cold and her heart suddenly pounded, destroying the vicarious image\nof her mother.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n\"I wish now I'd been different,\" Mrs. Condon said, standing in the door.\nHer dress was not yet on, but her underthings were fully as elaborate\nand shimmering as any gown could hope to be. \"And above everything else,\nI am sorry for the kind of mother you've had.\" This was so unexpected,\nthe other's voice was so unhappy, that Linda was startled. She hurried\nacross the room and laid a slim palm on her mother's full bare arm.\n\"Don't say that,\" Linda begged, distressed; \"you've been the best in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it,\" the elder returned, momentarily seated, her\nhands clasped on her full silken lap. \"But perhaps it's not too late.\nYou ought to go to a good school, where you'd learn everything, but\nprincipally what a bad thoughtless mama you have.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't stay a second in a place where they said that,\" Linda\ndeclared. A new apprehension touched her. \"You're not really thinking of\nsending me away!\" she cried. \"Why, you simply could not get along. You\nknow you couldn't! The maids never do up your dresses right; and you'd\nbe so lonely in the mornings you would nearly die.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Mrs. Condon admitted wearily. \"I would expire; but I was\nthinking of you--you're only beginning life; and the start you'll get\nwith me is all wrong. Or, anyway, most people think so.\"\n\n\"They are only jealous.\"\n\n\"Will you go into the closet, darling, and pour out a teeny little sip\nfrom my flask; mama feels a thousand years old this evening.\"\n\nReturning with the silver cup of the flask half full of pale pungent\nbrandy Linda could scarcely keep the tears from spilling over her\ncheeks. She had never before felt so sad. Her mother hastily drank,\nthe stinging odor was transferred to her lips; and there was a palpable\nrecovery of her customary spirit.\n\n\"I don't know what gets over me,\" she asserted. \"I'm certain, from what\nI've heard of them, that you wouldn't be a bit better off in one of\nthose fashionable schools for girls. Woman, young and older, were never\nmeant to be a lot together in one place. It's unnatural. They don't like\neach other, ever, and it's all hypocritical and nasty. You will get more\nfrom life, yes, and me. I'm honest, too honest for my own good, if the\ntruth was known.\"\n\nShe rose and unconsciously strayed to the mirror over the mantel where\nshe examined her countenance in absorbed detail.\n\n\"My skin is getting soft like putty,\" she remarked aloud to herself.\n\"The thing is, I've had my time and don't want to pay for it. Blondes\ngo quicker than dark women; you ought to last a long while, Linda.\" Mrs.\nCondon had turned, and her tone was again almost complaining, almost\nill-natured. Linda considered this information with a troubled face. It\nwas quite clear that it made her mother cross. \"I've seen men stop and\nlook at you right now, too, and you nothing more than a slip fourteen\nyears old. Of course, when I was fifteen I had a proposal; but I was\nvery forward; and somehow you're different--so dam' serious.\"\n\nShe couldn't help it, Linda thought, if she was serious; she really had\na great deal to think about, their income among other things. If she\ndidn't watch it, pay the bills every three months when it arrived, her\nmother would never have a dollar in the gold mesh bag. Then, lately, the\ndresses the elder threatened to buy were often impossible; Linda learned\nthis from the comments she heard after the wearing of evening affairs\nsent home against her earnest protests. They were, other women more\ndiscreetly gowned had agreed, ridiculous.\n\nLinda calmly realized that in this her judgment was superior to her\nmother's. In other ways, too, she felt she was really the elder; and her\ndismay at the possibility of going away to school had been mostly made\nup of the realization of how much her mother's well-being was dependent\non her.\n\nMrs. Condon, finishing her dressing in the bedroom, at times called out\nvarious injunctions, general or immediate. \"Tell them to have a taxi\nat the door for seven sharp. Have you talked to that little girl in the\nblack velvet?\" Linda hadn't and made a mental note to avoid her more\npointedly in the future. \"Get out mother's carriage boots from the\nhall closet; no, the others--you know I don't wear the black with coral\nstockings. They come off and the fur sticks to my legs. It will be very\ngay to-night; I hope to heaven Ross doesn't take too much again.\" Linda\nwell remembered that the last time Ross had taken too much her mother's\nDirectoire wrap had been completely torn in half. \"There, it is all\nnonsense about my fading; I look as well as I ever did.\"\n\nMrs. Condon stood before her daughter like a large flame-pink tulle\nflower. Her bright gold hair was constrained by black gauze knotted\nbehind, her bare shoulders were like powdered rosy marble and the\nfloating skirts gathered in a hand showed marvelously small satin-tied\ncarriage boots. Indeed Linda's exclamation of delight was entirely\nfrank. She had never seen her mother more radiant. The cunningly applied\nrouge, the enhanced brilliancy of her long-lashed eyes, had perfectly\nthe illusion of unspent beauty.\n\n\"Do stay down-stairs after dinner and play,\" the elder begged. \"And if\nyou want to go to the theatre, ask Mr. Bendix, at the desk, to send\nyou with that chauffeur we have had so much. I positively forbid your\nleaving the hotel else. It's a comfort after all, that you are serious.\nKiss mama--\"\n\nHowever, she descended with her mother in the elevator; there was a more\npublic caress; and the captain in the Chinese dining-room placed Linda\nat a small table against the wall. There she had clams--she adored\niced clams--creamed shrimps and oysters with potatoes _bordure_,\nalligator-pear salad and a beautiful charlotte cream with black walnuts.\nAfter this she sedately instructed the captain what to sign on the back\nof the dinner check--Linda Condon, room five hundred and seven--placed\nthirty-five cents beside the finger-bowl for the waiter, and made her\nway out to the news stand and the talkative girl who had it in charge.\nExhausting the possibilities of gossip, and deciding not to go out to\nthe theatre--in spite of the news girl's exciting description of a play\ncalled \"The New Sin\"--she was walking irresolutely through the high\ngilded and marble assemblage space when, unfortunately, she was captured\nby Mr. Moses Feldt.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nHe led her to a high-backed lounge against the wall, where, seated\non its extreme edge, he gazed silently at her with an expression of\nsentimental concern. Mr. Moses Feldt was a short round man, bald but\nfor a fluffy rim of pale hair, and with the palest imaginable eyes in\na countenance perpetually flushed by the physical necessity of\naccommodating his rotundity to awkward edges and conditions. As usual\nhe was dressed with the nicest care--a band of white linen laid in the\nopening of his waistcoat, his scarf ornamented by a pear-shaped pearl\non a diamond finished stem; his cloth-topped varnished black shoes\nglistened, while his short fat fingers clasped a prodigious unlighted\ncigar. At last, in a tone exactly suited to his gaze, he exclaimed:\n\n\"So that naughty mama has gone out again and deserted Moses and her\nlittle Linda!\" In what way her mother had deserted Mr. Feldt she failed\nto understand. Of course he wanted to marry them--the comprehensive\nphrase was his own--but that didn't include him in whatever they did.\nPrincipally it made a joke for their private entertainment. Mrs. Condon\nwould mimic his eager manner, \"Stella, let me take you both home where\nyou'll have the best in the land,\" And, \"Ladies like you ought to have a\nloving protection.\" Linda would laugh in her cool bell-like manner, and\nher mother add a satirical comment on the chance any Moses Feldt had of\nmarrying her.\n\nLinda at once found him ridiculous and a being who forced a slighting\nwarmth of liking. His appearance was preposterous, the ready emotion\noften too foolish for words; but underneath there was a--a goodness, a\nmysterious quality that stirred her heart to recognition. Certain rare\nthings in life and experience affected her like that memory of an old\nhappiness. She could never say what they might be, they came at\nthe oddest times and by the most extraordinary means; but at their\noccurrence she would thrill for a moment as if in response to a sound of\nmusic.\n\nIt was, for example, absurd that Mr. Moses Feldt, who was a Jew, should\nmake her feel like that, but he did. And all the while that she\nwas disagreeable to him, or mocking him behind his back, she was as\nuncomfortable and \"horrid\" as possible. While this fact, of course, only\nserved to make her horrider still. At present she adopted the manner of\na patience that nothing could quite exhaust; she was polite and formal,\nrelentlessly correct in position.\n\nMr. Moses Feldt, the cigar in his grasp, pressed a hand to the probable\nregion of his heart. \"You don't know how I think of you,\" he protested,\ntears in his eyes; \"just the idea of you exposed to anything at all in\nhotels keeps me awake nights. Now it's a drunk, or a fresh feller on the\nelevator, or--\"\n\n\"It's nice of you,\" Linda said, \"but you needn't worry. No one would\ndare to bother us. No one ever has.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't know it if they did,\" he replied despondently, \"at your\nage. And then your mother is so trustful and pleasant. Take those\nparties where she is so much--roof frolics and cocoanut groves and\nsubmarine caf\u00c3\u00a9s; they don't come to any good. Rowdy.\" Linda studied\nhim coldly; if he criticized them further she would leave. He mopped a\nshining brow with a large colorful silk handkerchief. \"It throws me into\na sweat,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Really, Mr. Feldt, you mustn't bother,\" she told him in one of her few\nimpulses of friendliness. \"You see, we are very experienced.\" He nodded\nwithout visible happiness at this truth. \"I'm a jackass!\" he cried.\n\"Judith tells me that all the time. If you could only see my daughters,\"\nhe continued with a new vigor; \"such lovely girls as they are. One dark\nlike you and the other fair as a daisy. Judith and Pansy. And my home\nthat darling mama made before she died.\" The handkerchief was again in\nevidence.\n\n\"Women and girls are funny. I can't get you there and not for nothing\nwill Judith make a step. It may be pride but it seems to me such\nnonsense. I guess I'm old-fashioned and love's old-fashioned. Homes have\ngone out of style with the rest. It's all these restaurants and roofs\nnow, yes, and studios. I tell the girls to stay away from them and from\nartists and so on. I don't encourage them at the apartment--a big lump\nof a feller with platinum bracelets on his wrists. What kind of a man\nwould that be! I'd like to know who'd buy goods from him.\n\n\"Sometimes, I'm sorry I got a lot of money, but it made mama happy. When\nshe laid there at the last sick and couldn't live, I said, 'Oh, if you\nonly won't leave me I'll give you gold to eat.'\" He was so moved, his\nface so red, that Linda grew acutely embarrassed. People were looking\nat them. She rose stiffly but, in spite of her effort to escape him, he\ncaught both her hands in his:\n\n\"You say I'm an old idiot like Judith,\" he begged. This Linda declined\nto do. And, \"Ask your mother if you won't come to dinner with the girls\nand me, cozy and at home--just once.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it will do no good,\" she admitted; \"but I'll try.\" She\nrealized that he was about to kiss her and moved quickly back. \"I am\nalmost afraid of you,\" he told her; \"you're so distant and elegant.\nJudith and Pansy would get on with you first rate. I'll telephone\ntomorrow, in the afternoon. If the last flowers I sent you came I never\nheard of it.\"\n\nShe thanked him appropriately for the roses and stood, erect and\nimpersonal, as a man in the hotel livery helped him into a coat. Mr.\nMoses Feldt waved the still unlighted cigar at her and disappeared\nthrough the rotating door to the street.\n\nShe gave a half-affected sigh of relief. Couldn't he see that her mother\nwould never marry him. At the same time the strange thrill touched her;\nthe sense of his absurdity vanished and she no longer remembered him\nperched like a painted rubber ball on the edge of the lounge.\n\nIn the somber red plush and varnished wood of the reception-room of\ntheir suite he seemed again charming. Perhaps it was because he,\ntoo, adored her mother. That wasn't the reason. The familiar rare joy\nlingered. It seemed now as though she were to capture and understand it\n... there was the vibration of music; and then, as always, she felt at\nonce sad and brave. But, in spite of her old effort to the contrary, the\nfeeling died away. Some day it would be clear to her; in the meanwhile\nMr. Moses Feldt became once more only ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nIn the morning she was dressed and had returned from breakfast before\nher mother stirred. The latter moved sharply, brought an arm up over her\nhead, and swore. It was a long while before she got up or spoke again,\nand Linda never remembered her in a worse temper. When, finally,\nshe came into the room where the breakfast-tray was laid, Linda was\ninexpressibly shocked--all that her mother had dreaded about her\nappearance had come disastrously true. Her face was hung with shadows\nlike smudges of dirt and her eyes were netted with lines.\n\nExamining the dishes with distaste she told Linda that positively she\ncould slap her for letting them bring up orange-juice. \"How often must\nI explain to you that it freezes my fingers.\" Linda replied that she\nhad repeated this in the breakfast-room and perhaps they had the wrong\norder. Neither her mother nor she said anything more until Mrs. Condon\nhad finished her coffee and started a second cigarette. Then Linda\nrelated something of Mr. Moses Feldt's call on the evening before. \"He\ncried right into his handkerchief,\" she said, \"until I thought I should\nsink.\"\n\nMrs. Condon eyed her daughter speculatively. \"Now if you were only four\nyears older,\" she declared, \"it would be a good thing. He was simply\nborn to be a husband.\" Horror filled Linda at the other's implication.\n\"Yes,\" the elder insisted; \"you couldn't do better; except, perhaps,\nfor those girls of his. But then you'd have no trouble making them\nmiserable. It's time to talk to you seriously about marriage.\" The smoke\nfrom the cigarette eddied in a gray veil across her unrefreshed face.\n\n\"You're old for your age, Linda; your life has made you that; and, like\nI said last night, it is rather better than not. Well, for you marriage,\nand soon as possible, is the proper thing. Mind, I have never said a\nword against it; only what suits one doesn't suit another. Where it\nwouldn't be anything more than an old ladies' home to me you need it\nearly and plenty. You are too intense. That doesn't go in the world. Men\ndon't like it. They want their pleasure and comfort without strings tied\nto them; the intensity has to be theirs.\n\n\"What you must get through your head is that love--whatever it is--and\nmarriage are two different things, and if you are going to be successful\nthey must be kept separate. You can't do anything with a man if you love\nhim; but then you can't do anything with him if he doesn't love you.\nThat's the whole thing in a breath. I am not crying down love, either;\nonly I don't want you to think it is the bread and butter while it's\nnothing more than those little sweet cakes at Henri's.\n\n\"Now any girl who marries a poor man or for love--they are the same\nthing--is a fool and deserves what she gets. No one thanks her for it,\nhim least of all; because if she does love him it is only to make them\nmiserable. She's always at him--where did he go and why did he stay so\nlong, and no matter what he says she knows it's a lie. More times than\nnot she's right, too. I can't tell you too often--men don't want to be\nloved, they like to be flattered and flattered and then flattered again.\nYou'd never believe how childish they are.\n\n\"Make them think they're it and don't give too much--that's the secret.\nAbove all else don't be easy on them. Don't say 'all right, darling,\nnext spring will do as well for a new suit.' Get it then and let him\nworry about paying for it, if worry he must. If they don't give it to\nyou some one smarter will wear it. But I started to talk about getting\nmarried.\n\n\"Choose a Moses Feldt, who will always be grateful to you, and keep him\nat it. They are so easy to land it's a kind of shame, too. Perhaps I am\ntelling you this too soon, but I don't want any mistakes. Well, pick\nout your Moses--and mama will help you there--and suddenly, at the right\ntime, show him that you can be affectionate; surprise him with it and\nyou so staid and particular generally. Don't overdo it, promise more\nthan you ever give--\n\n\"In the closet, dearie, just a little. That's a good girl. Mama's so\ndry.\" She rose, the silver cup of the flask in her hand, and moved\ninevitably to the mirror. \"My hair's a sight,\" she remarked; \"all\nstrings. I believe I'll get a permanent wave. They say it lasts for\nsix months or more, till the ends grow out. Makes a lot of it, too, and\nholds the front together. If you've ever had dye in your hair, I hear,\nit will break off like grass.\"\n\nLinda pondered over what she had been told of love and marriage; on the\nwhole the exposition had been unsatisfactory. The latter she was able to\ngrasp, but her mother had admitted an inability exactly to fix love.\nOne fact, apparently, was clear--it was a nuisance and a hindrance to\nhappiness, or rather to success. Love upset things. Still she had the\nstrongest objection possible to living forever with a man like Mr.\nMoses Feldt. At once all that she had hoped for from life grew flat and\nuninteresting. She had no doubt of her mother's correctness and wisdom;\nthe world was like that; she must make the best of it.\n\nThere was some telephoning, inquiries, and she heard the elder make an\nappointment with a hair-dresser for three that afternoon. She wondered\nwhat it would be like to have your hair permanently waved and hoped\nthat she would see it done. This, too, she realized, was a part of the\nnecessity of always considering men--they liked your hair to be wavy.\nHers was as straight and stupid as possible. She, in turn, examined\nherself in a mirror: the black bang fell exactly to her eyebrows, her\nface had no color other than the carnation of her lips and her deep\nblue eyes. She moved away and critically studied her figure; inches and\ninches too thin, she decided. Undoubtedly her mother was right, and she\nmust marry at the first opportunity--if she could find a man, a rich\nman, who was willing.\n\nHer thoughts returned vaguely to the mystery, the nuisance, of love.\nSurely she had heard something before, immensely important, about it,\nand totally different from all her mother had said. Her mind was filled\nwith the fantastic image of a forest, of dangers, and a fat china figure\nwith curled plumes, a nodding head, that brushed her with fear and\ndisgust. A shuddering panic took possession of her, flashes burned\nbefore her eyes, and she ran gasping to the perfumed soft reassurances\nof her mother.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nIn a recurrence of her surprising concern of the day before Mrs. Condon\ndeclined to leave her dearest Linda alone; and, their arms caught\ntogether in a surging affection, they walked down Fifth Avenue toward\nthe hairdresser's. There was a diffused gray sparkle of sunlight--it\nwas early for the throngs--through which they passed rapidly to the\naccompaniment of a rapid eager chatter. Linda wore a deep smooth camel's\nhair cape, over which her intense black hair poured like ink, and her\nface was shaded by a dipping green velvet hat. Her mother, in one of\nthe tightly cut suits she affected, had never been more like a perfect\ncompanion.\n\nThey saw, in the window of a store for men, a set of violent purple\nwool underwear, and barely escaped hysterics at the thought of Mr. Moses\nFeldt in such a garb. They giggled idiotically at the spectacle of a\ncountryman fearfully making the sharp descent from the top of a lurching\nomnibus. And then, when they had reached the place of Mrs. Condon's\nappointment, stopped at the show of elaborately waved hair on wax heads\nand chose which, probably, would resemble the elder and which, in a very\nshort while now, Linda.\n\nThere was an impressive interior, furnished in gray panels and silvery\nwood; and the young woman at the desk was more surprisingly waved than\nanything they had yet seen. M. Joseph would be ready almost immediately;\nand in the meanwhile Mrs. Condon could lay aside her things in\npreparation for the hair to be washed. She did this while Linda followed\nevery movement with the deepest interest.\n\nAt the back of the long room was a succession of small alcoves, each\nwith an important-looking chair and mirror and shelves, a white basin,\nwater-taps and rubber tubes. Settled, in comfort, Mrs. Condon's hair was\nspread out in a bright metal tray fastened to the back of the chair, and\nthe attendant, a moist tired girl in a careless waist, sprayed the short\nthick gold-colored strands.\n\n\"My,\" she observed, \"what some wouldn't give for your shade! Never been\ntouched, I can see, either. A lady comes in with real Titian, but yours\nis more select. It positively is Lillian Russell.\" While she talked\nher hands sped with incredible rapidity and skill. \"The gentlemen don't\nnotice it; of course not; oh, no! There was a girl here, a true blonde,\nbut she didn't stay long--her own car, yes, indeed. Married her right\nout of the establishment. There wasn't any nonsense to her.\n\n\"So this is your little girl! I'd never have believed it. Not that she\nhasn't a great deal of style, a great deal--almost, you might say, like\nan Egyptian. In the movies last night; her all over. It's a type that\nwill need studying. Bertha Kalich. But for me--\"\n\nAlready, Linda saw, this part of the operation was done. The girl\nwheeled into position a case that had a fan and ring of blue flickering\nflames, and a cupped tube through which hot air was poured over her\nmother's head. M. Joseph strutted in, a small carefully dressed man with\na diminutive pointed gray beard and formal curled mustache. He spoke\nwith what Linda supposed was a French accent, and his manners, at least\nto them, were beautiful. But because the girl had not put out the blue\nflames quickly enough he turned to her with a voice of quivering rage.\n\nIt was so unexpected, in the middle of his bowing and smooth assurances,\nthat Linda was startled, and had to think about him all over. The result\nof this was a surprising dislike; she hated, even, to see him touch her\nmother, as he unnecessarily did in directing them into the enclosure for\nthe permanent wave.\n\nThe place itself filled her with the faint horror of instruments and the\nunknown. Above the chair where Mrs. Condon now sat there was a circle\nin the ceiling like the base of a chandelier and hanging down from it\non twisted green wires were a great number of the strangest things\nimaginable: they were as thick as her wrist, but round, longer and\nhollow, white china inside and covered with brown wrapping. The wires\nof each, she discovered, led over a little wheel and down again to\na swinging clock-like weight. In addition to this there were strange\ndepressing handles on the wall by a dial with a jiggling needle and\nclearly marked numbers.\n\nThe skill of the girl who had washed her mother's hair, however, was\nslight compared with M. Joseph's dexterity. The comb flashed in his\nwhite narrow hands; in no time at all every knot was urged out into a\nshining smoothness. \"Just the front?\" he inquired. Not waiting for\nMrs. Condon's reply, he detached a strand from the mass over her brow,\nimpaled it on a hairpin, while he picked up what might have been a thick\nsteel knitting-needle with one end fastened in the middle of a silver\nquarter. The latter, it developed, had a hole in it, through which he\ndrew the strand of hair, and then wrapped it with an angry tightness\nabout the long projection.\n\nAt this exact moment a new girl, but tired and moist, appeared, took a\nhank of white threads from a dressing-table, and tied that separate lock\nfirmly. This, Linda counted, was repeated fifteen times; and when it was\naccomplished she was unable to repress a nervous laughter. Really, her\nmother looked too queer for words: the long rigid projections stood out\nall over her head like--like a huge pincushion; no, it was a porcupine.\nMrs. Condon smiled in uncertain recognition of her daughter's mirth.\n\nThen Linda's attention followed M. Joseph to a table against a\npartition, where he secured a white cotton strip from a film of them\nsoaking in a shallow tray, took up some white powder on the blade of\na dessert knife and transferred it to the strip. This he wrapped and\nwrapped about the hair fastened on a spindle, tied it in turn, and\ndragged down one of the brown objects on wires, which, to Linda's\ngreat astonishment, fitted precisely over the cotton-bound hair. Again,\nfifteen times, M. Joseph did this, fastening each connection with the\nturn of a screw. When so much was accomplished her mother's hair, it\nseemed, had grown fast to the ceiling in a tangle of green ends. It was\nthe most terrifying spectacle Linda had ever witnessed. Obscure thoughts\nof torture, of criminals executed by electricity, froze her in a set\napprehension.\n\nThe hair-dresser stepped over to the dials on the wall, and, with a\nsharp comprehensive glance at his apparatus, moved a handle as far as it\nwould go. Nothing immediately happened, and Linda gave a relaxing sigh\nof relief. M. Joseph, however, became full of a painful attention.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nHe brought into view an unsuspected tube, with a cone of paper at its\nend, and bent over her mother, directing a stream of cold air against\nher head. \"How do you feel?\" he asked, with, Linda noticed, a startling\nloss of his first accent. Mrs. Condon so far felt well enough.\nThen, before Linda's startled gaze, every single one of the fifteen\nimprisoning tubes began to steam with an extraordinary vigor; not only\ndid they steam, like teapots, but drops of water formed and slowly slid\nover her mother's face. If the process appeared weird at the beginning,\nnow it was utterly fantastic.\n\nThe little white vapor spurts played about Mrs. Condon's dripping\ncountenance; they increased rather than diminished; actually it\nresembled a wrecked locomotive she had once seen. \"How are you?\" M.\nJoseph demanded nervously. \"Is it hot anywhere?\" With a sudden gesture\nshe replied in a shaking voice, \"Here.\"\n\nInstantly he was holding the paper cone with its cold air against her\nscalp, and the heat was subdued. He glanced nervously at his watch, and\nMrs. Condon managed to ask, \"How long?\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes.\"\n\nDangerous as the whole proceeding seemed nothing really happened, and\nLinda's fears gradually faded into a mere curiosity and interest. A\ncurtain hung across the door to the rest of the establishment, but it\nhad been brushed partly aside; and she could see, in the compartment\nthey had vacated, another man bending with waving irons over the\nliberated mass of a woman's hair. He was very much like M. Joseph, but\nhe was younger and had only a dark scrap of mustache. As he caught up\nthe hair with a quick double twist he leaned very close to the woman's\nface, whispering with an expression that never changed, an expression\nlike that of the wax heads in the show-case. He bent so low that Linda\nwas certain their cheeks had touched. She pondered at length over this,\ngazing now at the man beyond and now at M. Joseph flitting with the\ncold-air tube about her mother; wondering if, when she grew older, she\nwould like a hair-dresser's cheek against hers. Linda decided not. The\nidea didn't shock her, the woman in the other space plainly liked\nit; still she decided she wouldn't. A different kind of man, she told\nherself, would be nicer.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a sharp, unpleasant odor--the odor of\nscorched hair; and she was absolutely rigid with horror at an agonized\ncry from her mother.\n\n\"It's burning me terribly,\" the latter cried. \"Oh, I can't stand it.\nStop! Stop!\"\n\nM. Joseph, as white as plaster, rushed to the wall and reversed the\nhandle, and Mrs. Condon started from the chair, her face now streaming\nwith actual tears; but before she could escape the man threw himself on\nher shoulders.\n\n\"You mustn't move,\" he whispered desperately, \"you'll tear your hair\nout. I tell you no harm's been done. Everything is all right. Please,\nplease don't cry like that. It will ruin my business. There are others\nin the establishment. Stop!\" he shook her viciously.\n\nLinda had risen, terrorized; and Mrs. Condon, with waving plucking\nhands, was sobbing an appeal to be released. \"My head, my head,\" she\nrepeated. \"I assure you\"--the man motioned to a pallid girl to hold her\nin the chair. With a towel to protect his hand he undid a screw,\nlifted off the cap and untwisted the cotton from a bound lock of hair;\nreleasing it, in turn, from the spindle it fell forward in a complete\ncorkscrew over Mrs. Condon's face.\n\n\"Do you see!\" he demanded. \"Perfect. I give you my word they'll all be\nlike that. The cursed heat ran up on me,\" he added in a swift aside to\nhis assistant. \"Has Mrs. Bellows gone? Who's still in the place? Here,\nloose that binding ... thank God, that one is all right, too.\"\n\nTogether they unfastened most of the connections, and a growing fringe\nof long remarkable curls marked Mrs. Condon's pain-drawn and dabbled\nface. Linda sobbed uncontrollably; but perhaps, after all, nothing\nfrightful had happened. Her poor mother! Then fear again tightened about\nher heart at the perturbed expression that overtook the hair-dresser.\nHe was trying in vain to remove one of the caps. She caught enigmatic\nwords--\"the borax, crystallized ... solid. It would take a plumber ...\nhave to go.\"\n\nThe connection was immovable. Even in her suffering Mrs. Condon implored\nM. Joseph to save her hair. Nothing, however, could be done; he admitted\nit with pale lips. The thing might be chiseled off; in the end he tried\nto force a release and the strand, with a renewal of Mrs.\nCondon's agony--now, in the interest of her appearance, heroically\nwithstood--snapped short in the container.\n\nRapidly recovering her vigor, she launched on a tirade against M. Joseph\nand his permanent waving establishment--Linda had never before heard her\nmother talk in such a loud brutal manner, nor use such heated unpleasant\nwords, and the girl was flooded with a wretched shame. Still another\nlock, it was revealed, had been ruined, and crumbled to mere dust in its\nowner's fingers.\n\n\"The law will provide for you,\" she promised.\n\n\"Your hair was dyed,\" the proprietor returned vindictively. \"The girl\nwho washed it will testify. Every one is warned against the permanent if\ntheir hair has been colored. So it was at your own risk.\"\n\n\"My head's never been touched with dye,\" Mrs. Condon shrilly answered.\n\"You lying little ape. And well does that young woman know it. She\ncomplimented me herself on a true blonde.\" The girl had, too, right\nbefore Linda.\n\n\"You ought to be thrashed out of the city.\"\n\n\"Your money will be given back to you,\" M. Joseph told her.\n\nOutside they found a taxi, and sped back to their hotel. Above, Mrs.\nCondon removed her hat; and, before the uncompromising mirror, studied\nher wrecked hair--a frizzled vacancy was directly over her left\nbrow--and haggard face. When she finally turned to Linda, her manner,\nher words, were solemn.\n\n\"I'm middle-aged,\" she said.\n\nA dreary silence enveloped them sitting in the dark reception-room while\nMrs. Condon restlessly shredded unlighted cigarettes on the floor. She\nhad made no effort to repair the damages to her appearance, and when the\ntelephone bell sharply sounded, she reached out in a slovenly negligence\nof manner. Linda could hear a blurred articulation and her mother\nanswering listlessly. The latter at last said: \"Very well, at seven\nthen; you'll stop for us.\" She hung up the receiver, stared blankly at\nLinda, and then went off into a harsh mirth. \"Oh, my God!\" she cried;\n\"the old ladies' home!\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nWith her mother away on a wedding-trip with Mr. Moses Feldt, Linda was\nsuddenly projected into the companionship of his two daughters. One,\nas he had said, was light, but a different fairness from Mrs.\nCondon's--richly thick, like honey; while Judith, the elder, who must\nhave been twenty, was dark in skin, in everything but her eyes, which\nwere a contrasting ashen-violet. She spoke at once of Linda's flawless\nwhiteness:\n\n\"A magnolia,\" she said, in a deliberate dark voice; \"you are quite\na gorgeous child. Do you mind my saying that your clothes are rather\nquaint? They aren't inevitable, and yours ought to be that.\"\n\nThey were at lunch in the Feldt dining-room, an interior of heavy\nornately carved black wood, panels of Chinese embroidery in imperial\nyellow, and a neutral mauve carpet. The effect, with glittering\niridescent pyramids of glass, massive frosted repouss\u00c3\u00a9 silver, burnished\ngold-plate and a wide table decoration of orchids and fern, was tropical\nand intense. It was evident to Linda that the Feldts were very rich\nindeed.\n\nThe entire apartment resembled the dining-room, while the building\nitself filled a whole city block, with a garden and fountains like an\nelaborate public square. Linda, however, wasn't particularly impressed\nby such show; she saw that Judith and Pansy had expected that of her;\nbut she was determined not to exhibit a surprise that would imply any\nchanges in her mother's and her condition. In addition, Linda calmly\ntook such surroundings for granted. Her primary conception of possible\nexistence was elegance; its necessity had so entered into her being that\nit had departed from her consciousness.\n\n\"I must take you to Lorice,\" Judith continued; \"she will know better\nthan any one else what you ought to have. You seem terribly pure--at\nfirst. But you're not a snowdrop; oh, no--something very rare in a\nconservatory. Much better style than your mother.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't mind Judith,\" Pansy put in; \"she's always like that.\"\nA silence followed in which they industriously dipped the leaves of\nmammoth artichokes into a buttery sauce. Linda, as customary, said very\nlittle, she listened with patient care to the others and endeavored to\narrive at conclusions. She liked Pansy, who was as warm and simple as\nher father. Judith was harder to understand. She was absorbed in color\nand music, and declared that ugliness gave her a headache at once.\nAltogether, Linda decided, she was rather silly, especially about men;\nand at times her emotions would rise beyond control until she wept in a\nthin hysterical gasping.\n\nThe room where, mostly, they sat was small, but with a high ceiling,\nand hung in black, with pagoda-like vermilion chairs. The light, in the\nevening, was subdued; and Pansy and Judith, in extremely clinging vivid\ndresses, the former's hair piled high in an amber mass and Judith's\ndrawn severely across her ears, were lovely. Linda thought of the\ntropical butterflies of the river Amazon, of orchids like those always\non the dining-room table. A miniature grand piano stood against the\ndrapery, and Judith often played. Linda learned to recognize some of\nthe composers. Pansy liked best the modern waltzes; Judith insisted that\nRichard Strauss was incomparable; but Linda developed an overwhelming\npreference for Gluck. The older girl insisted that this was an\naffectation; for a while she tried to confuse Linda's knowledge; but\nfinally, playing the airs of \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" she admitted that\nthe latter was sincere.\n\n\"They sound so cool,\" Linda said in a clear and decided manner.\n\nThere was a man with them, and he shook his head in a mock sadness.\n\"So young and yet so formal. If, with the rest, you had Judith's\ntemperament, you would be the most irresistible creature alive. For see,\nmy dear child, as it is you stir neither tenderness nor desire; you are\nremote and perfect, and faintly wistful. I can't imagine being human or\neven comfortable with you about. Then, too, you have too much wisdom.\"\n\n\"She is frightful,\" Pansy agreed; \"she's never upset nor her hair a\nsight; and, above all else, Linda won't tell you a thing.\"\n\n\"Some day,\" Judith informed them from the rippling whisper of the piano,\n\"she will be magnificently loved.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the man continued; \"but what will Linda, Linda Condon, give\nin return?\"\n\n\"It's a mistake to give much,\" Linda said evenly.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" Judith cried. \"Give everything; spend every feeling, every\nnerve.\"\n\n\"You are remarkable, of course; almost no women have the courage of\ntheir emotions.\" His name was Reynold Chase, a long thin grave young\nman in a dinner coat, who wrote brilliant and successful comedies. \"Yet\nLinda isn't parsimonious.\" He turned to her. \"Just what are you? What do\nyou think of love?\"\n\n\"I haven't thought about it much,\" she replied slowly. \"I'm not sure\nthat I know what it means. At least it hasn't anything to do with\nmarriage--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he interrupted her.\n\nHer usually orderly mind grew confused; it eddied as though with the\nsound of the piano. \"It is not marriage,\" she vaguely repeated her\nmother's instruction. Reynold Chase supported her.\n\n\"That destroys it,\" he asserted. \"This love is as different as possible\nfrom the ignominious impulse eternally tying the young into knots. It's\nanti-social.\"\n\n\"How stupid you are, Reynold,\" Pansy protested. \"If you want to use\nthose complicated words take Judith into the drawing-room. I'm sure\nLinda is dizzy, too.\"\n\nThe latter's mental confusion lingered; she had a strong sense of having\nheard Reynold Chase say these strange things long before. Judith left\nthe piano, sat beside him, and he lightly kissed her. A new dislike of\nJudith Feldt deepened in Linda's being. She had no reason for it, but\nsuddenly she felt absolutely opposed to her. The manner in which Judith\nrested against the man by her was very distasteful. It offended Linda\ninexplicably; she wanted to draw into an infinity of distance from all\ncontact with men and life.\n\nShe didn't even want to make one of those marriages that had nothing to\ndo with love, but was only a sensible arrangement for the securing\nof gowns and velvet hangings and the luxury of enclosed automobiles.\nSuddenly she felt lonely, and hoped that her mother would come back\nsoon.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nBut when her mother, now Mrs. Moses Feldt, did return, Linda was\nconscious of a keen disappointment. Somehow she never actually came\nback. It wasn't only that, after so many years together, she occupied\na room with another than Linda, but her manner was changed; it had lost\nall freedom of heart and speech. The new Mrs. Feldt was heavily polite\nto her husband's daughters; Linda saw that she liked Pansy, but Judith\nmade her uncomfortable. She expressed this in an isolated return of the\nold confidences:\n\n\"That girl,\" she said sharply, \"likes petting. She can talk all night\nabout her soul and beauty, and play the piano till her fingers drop\noff, but I--I--know. You can't fool me where they are concerned. I can\nrecognize an unhealthy sign. I never believed in going to all those\nconcerts and kidding yourself into a fever. I may have shown myself a\ntime, but you mark my word--I was honest compared to Judith Feldt. Don't\nyou be impressed with all her art talk and the books she reads. I was\nlooking into one yesterday, and it made me blush; you can believe it or\nnot, it takes some book for that!\"\n\nAt the same time she treated Judith with a studious sweetness. Mr. Moses\nFeldt--Linda always thought of him as that--was a miracle of kindly\ncheerfulness. He made his wife and her daughter, and his own girls, an\nunbroken succession of elaborate and costly presents. \"What's it for\nif not to spend on those you love?\" he would remark, bringing a small\njeweler's box wrapped in creamy-pink paper from his pocket. \"You can't\ntake it with you. I wasn't born with it--mama and I were as poor as\nany--you'll forgive me, Stella, I know, for speaking of her. I got\nenough heart to love you both. 'Oh, mama!' I said, and she dying, 'if\nyou only won't go, I'll give you gold to eat.'\"\n\nCuriously, as Linda grew older, the consciousness of her stepfather\nas an absurd fat little man dwindled; she lost all sense of his actual\nperson; and, as the influence of her mother slipped from her life, the\nmental conception of Mr. Moses Feldt deepened. She thought about him a\ngreat deal and very seriously; the things he said, the warm impact of\nhis being, vibrated in her memory. He had the effect on her of the music\nof Christopher Gluck--the effect of a pure fine chord.\n\nPansy she now thought of with a faint contempt: she was rapidly growing\nthick-waisted and heavy, and she was engaged to a dull young man not\nrich enough to be interesting. They sat about in frank embraces and\nindulged in a sentimental speech that united Judith and Linda in common\noppression.\n\nThere were, not infrequently, gatherings of the Feldts at dinner, a\nnoisy good-tempered uproar of a great many voices speaking at once;\nextraordinary quantities of superlative jewels and dresses of superfine\ntextures; but the latter, Linda thought, were too vivid in pattern or\ncolor for the short full maternal figures they often adorned. But no\none, it seemed, considered himself ageing or even, in spite of the most\npositive indications, aged. The wives with faded but fashionable hair\nand animated eyes in spent faces talked with vigorous raillery about\nthe \"boys,\" who, it might have happened, had gone in a small masculine\ncompany to a fervid musical show the evening before. While they, in\ntheir turn, thick like their brother or cousin Moses, with time-wasted\nhair and countenances marked with the shrewdness in the service of which\nthe greater part of their lives had vanished, had their little jokes\nabout the \"girls\" and the younger and handsomer beaux who threatened\ntheir happiness.\n\nAt times the topic of business crept into the lighter discussion, and,\nin an instant, the gaiety evaporated and left expressionless men\nand quick sharp sentences steely with decision, or indirect and\nimperturbably blank. A memorandum book and a gold pencil would appear\nfor an enigmatic note, after which the cheerfulness slowly revived.\n\nThe daughters resembled Judith or the slower placidity of Pansy; while\nthere was still another sort, more vigorous in being, who consciously\ndiscussed riding academies, the bridle-paths of Central Park, and the\ninternational tennis. Their dress held a greater restraint than the\nelders; though Linda recognized that it was no less lavish; and their\nfeminine trifles, the morocco beauty-cases and powder-boxes, the\nshoulder-pins, their slipper and garter buckles were extravagant in\nexquisite metals and workings.\n\nThey arrived in limousines with dove-colored upholstery and crystal\nvases of maidenhair fern and moss-roses; and often, in such a car, Linda\nwent to the theatre with Judith or Pansy and some cousins. Usually it\nwas a matinee, where their seats were the best procurable, directly at\nthe stage; and they sat in a sleek expensive row eating black chocolates\nfrom painted boxes ruffled in rose silk. The audience, composed mostly\nof their own world, followed the exotic fortunes of the plays with a\ncomplete discrimination in every possible emotional display and crisis.\n\nLithe actresses in a revealing severity of attire, like spoiled nuns\nwith carmine lips, suffering in ingenuous problems of the passions,\nagonized in shuddering tones; or else they went to concerts to hear\nyoung violinists, slender, with intense faces and dramatic hair, play\nconcertos that irritated Linda with little shivers of delight.\n\nSometimes they had lunch in a restaurant of Circassian walnut and velvet\ncarpets, with cocktails, and eggs elaborate with truffles and French\npastry. Then, afterward, they would stop at a confectioner's, or at a\ncafe where there was dancing, for tea. They all danced in a perfection\nof slow graceful abandon, with youths who, it seemed to Linda, did\nnothing else.\n\nShe accepted her part in this existence as inevitable, yet she was\npersistently aware of a feeling of strangeness, of essential difference\nfrom it. She was unable to lose a sense of looking on, as if morning,\nnoon and night she were at another long play. Linda regarded it--as she\ndid so much else--with neither enthusiasm nor marked annoyance. Probably\nit would continue without change through her entire life. All that was\nnecessary, and easily obtained, was a sufficient amount of money.\n\nHer manner, Pansy specially complained, was not intimate and inviting;\nin her room Linda usually closed the door; the frank community of the\nsisters was distasteful to her. She demanded an extraordinary amount\nof personal privacy. Linda never consulted Judith's opinion about her\nclothes, nor exchanged the more significant aspects of feeling. Alone in\na bed-chamber furnished in silvery Hungarian ash, her bed a pale quilted\nluxury with Madeira linen crusted in monograms, without head or foot\nboards, and a dressing-table noticeably bare, she would deliberately and\ndelicately prepare for the night.\n\nWhile Judith's morning bath steamed with the softness and odor of\nlavender crystals, Linda slipped into water almost cold. This, with her\nclear muslins and heavy black silk stockings, her narrow unornamented\nslippers, represented the perfection of niceness.\n\nThere were others than Pansy, however, who commented on what they called\nher superiority--the young men who appeared in the evening. A number\nof them, cousins of the Feldt dinner parties or more casual, tried to\nengage her sympathies in their persons and prospects. It was a society\nof early maturity. But, without apparent effort, she discouraged them,\nprincipally by her serene lack of interest. It was a fundamental part\nof her understanding of things that younger men were unprofitable; she\nliked far better the contemporaries of Moses Feldt.\n\nReynold Chase had ceased his visits, but his place had been taken by\nanother and still another emotionally gifted man. The present one was\ndark and imperturbable: they knew little of him beyond the facts that\nhe had been a long while in the Orient, that his manner and French were\nunsurpassed, and that practically every considerable creative talent in\nNew York was entertained in his rooms.\n\nJudith had been to one of his parties; and, the following morning in\nbed, she told Pansy and Linda the most remarkable things.\n\n\"It would never do for Pansy,\" she concluded; \"but I must get Markue to\nask you sometime, Linda. How old are you now? Well, that's practically\nsixteen, and you are very grown up. You would be quite sensational, in\none of your plain white frocks, in his apartment. You'd have to promise\nnot to tell your mother, though. She thinks I'm leading you astray\nnow--the old dear. Does she think I am blind? I met a man last week,\na friend of father's, who used to know her. Of course he wouldn't say\nanything, men are such idiots about that--like ostriches with their\npasts buried and all the feathers sticking out--but there was a\nchampagne expression in his smile.\"\n\nLinda wondered, later, if she'd care to go to a party of Markue's. There\nwas a great deal of drinking at such affairs; and though she rather\nliked cordials, cr\u00c3\u00aame de th\u00c3\u00a9 and Grand Marnier, even stronger\nthings flavored with limes and an occasional frigid cocktail, she\ndisliked--from a slight experience--men affected by drink. Judith had\ncalled her a constitutional prude; this, she understood, was a term of\nreproach; and she wondered if, applied to her, it were just.\n\nUsually it meant a religious person or one fussy about the edge of her\nskirt; neither of which she ever considered. She didn't like to sit in\na corner and be hugged--even that she could now assert with a degree\nof knowledge--but it wasn't because she was shocked. Nothing, she told\nherself gravely, shocked her; only certain acts and moments annoyed her\nexcessively. It was as if her mind were a crisp dress with ribbons which\nshe hated to have mussed or disarranged.\n\nLinda didn't take the trouble to explain this. Now that her mother had\nwithdrawn from her into a perpetual and uncomfortable politeness she\nconfided in no one. She would have been at a loss to put her complicated\nsensations and thoughts into words. Mr. Moses Feldt, the only one to\nwhom she could possibly talk intimately, would be upset by her feelings.\nHe would give her a hug and the next day bring up a new present from his\npocket.\n\nHer clothes, with the entire support of Lorice, were all delicate\nin fabric, mostly white with black sashes, and plainly ruffled. She\ndetested the gray crepe de Chine from which Judith's undergarments were\nmade and the colored embroidery of Pansy's; while she ignored scented\ntoilet-waters and extracts. Markue, in finally asking her to a party at\nhis rooms, said that there she would resemble an Athenian marble, of the\nun-painted epoch, in the ballet of Scheherazade.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\n\"There's nothing special to say about Markue's parties,\" Judith,\ndressing, told Linda. \"You will simply have to take what comes your way.\nThere is always some one serious at them, if you insist, as usual, on\ndignity.\" She stood slim and seductive, like a perverse pierrot,\nbefore the oppressive depths of a black mirror. Linda had finished her\npreparations for the evening. There was no departure from her customary\nblanched exactness. She studied her reflection across Judith's shoulder;\nher intense blue eyes, under the level blot of her bang, were grave on\nthe delicate pallor of her face.\n\nIn the taxi, slipping rapidly down-town, Linda was conscious of a slight\nunusual disturbance of her indifference. This had nothing to do with\nwhether or not she'd be a success; her own social demands were so small\nthat any considerable recognition of her was unimportant. Her present\nfeeling came from the fact that to-night, practically, she was making\nher first grown-up appearance in the world, the world from which she\nmust select the materials of her happiness and success. To-night she\nwould have an opportunity to put into being all that--no matter how\nfirmly held--until now had been but convictions.\n\nHer interest was not in whom or what she might meet, but in herself.\nJudith, smoking a cigarette in a mist of silver fox, was plainly\nexcited. \"I like Markue awfully,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Does he care for you?\" Linda asked.\n\n\"That,\" said Judith, \"I can't make out--if he likes me or if it's\njust anonymous woman. I wish it were the first, Linda.\" Her voice was\nshadowed; suddenly, in spite of her youth and exhilaration, she seemed\nhaggard and spent. Linda recognized this in a cold scrutiny. Privately\nshe decided that the other was a fool--she didn't watch her complexion\nat all.\n\nThe motor turned west in the low Forties and stopped before a high\nnarrow stone fa\u00c3\u00a7ade with a massive griffon-guarded door. Judith led the\nway directly into the elevator and designated Markue's floor. It was\nat the top of the building, where he met them with his impenetrable\ncourtesy and took them into a bare room evidently planned for a studio.\nThere were an empty easel, the high blank dusty expanse of the skylight,\nand chairs with the somber hats and coats of men and women's wraps like\nthe glistening shed skins of brilliant snakes.\n\nThey turned through the hall to an interior more remarkable than\nanything Linda could have imagined; it seemed to her very high, without\nwindows and peaked like a tent. Draperies of intricate Eastern color\nhung in long folds. There were no chairs, but low broad divans about the\nwalls, a thick carpet with inlaid stands in the center laden with boxes\nof cigarettes, sugared exotic sweets and smoking incense. It was so dim\nand full of thick scent, the shut effect was so complete, that for a\nmoment Linda felt painfully oppressed; it seemed impossible to breathe\nin the wavering bluish atmosphere.\n\nMarkue, who had appeared sufficiently familiar outside, now had a\nstrange portentous air; the gleams of his quick black eyes, the dusky\ntone of his cheeks, his impassive grace, startled her. New York was\nutterly removed: the taxi that had brought Judith and her, the swirling\ntraffic of Columbus Circle and smooth undulations of Fifth Avenue, were\nlost with a different life. She saw, however, the open door to another\nroom full of clear light, and her self-possession rapidly returned.\nJudith--as she had threatened--at once deserted her; and Linda found an\ninconspicuous corner of a divan.\n\nThere were, perhaps, twenty people in the two rooms, and each one\nengaged her attention. A coffee-colored woman was sitting beyond her,\nclad in loose red draperies to which were sewed shining patterns of\nwhat she thought was gold. Markue was introducing Judith, and the seated\nfigure smiled pleasantly with a flash of beautiful teeth and the supple\ngesture of a raised brown palm. That, Linda decided, was the way she\nshook hands. Two dark-skinned men, one in conventional evening dress,\nwere with her; they had small fine features and hair like carved ebony.\n\nLinda had never before been at an affair with what she was forced to\ncall colored people; instinctively she was antagonistic and superior.\nShe turned to a solemn masculine presence with a ruffled shirt and\nhigh black stock; he was talking in a resonant voice and with dramatic\ngestures to a woman with a white face and low-drawn hair. Linda was\nfascinated by the latter, dressed in a soft clinging dull garnet.\nIt wasn't her clothes, although they were remarkable, that held her\nattention, but the woman's mouth. Apparently, it had no corners. Like a\nlittle band of crimson rubber, or a ring of vivid flame, it shifted\nand changed in the oddest shapes. It was an unhappy mouth, and made her\nthink of pain; but perhaps not so much that as hunger ... not for food,\nLinda was certain. What did she want?\n\nThere was a light appealing laugh from another seated on the floor in a\nfloating black dinner dress with lovely ankles in delicate Spanish lace\nstockings; her head was thrown back for the whisper of a heavy man with\nashen hair, a heavenly scarf and half-emptied glass.\n\nHer bare shoulders, Linda saw, were as white as her own, as white but\nmore sloping. The other's hair, though, was the loveliest red possible.\nThe entire woman, relaxed and laughing in the perfumery and swimming\nshadows, was irresistible. A man with a huge nose and blank eyes, his\nhands disfigured with extraordinary rings, momentarily engaged her.\nThen, at the moment when she saw an inviting and correctly conventional\nyouth, he crossed and sat at her side.\n\n\"Quite a show,\" he said in the manner she had expected and approved. The\nglow of his cigarette wavered over firmly cut lips. \"We've just come to\nNew York,\" he continued. \"I don't know any one here but Markue, do you?\"\nLinda explained her own limitations. \"The Victory's fine and familiar.\"\n\nShe followed his gaze to where a winged statue with flying drapery was\nset on a stand. She had seen it before, but without interest. Now it\nheld her attention. It wasn't a large cast, not over three feet high,\nbut suddenly Linda thought that it was the biggest thing in the room; it\nseemed to expand as she watched it.\n\nBeside the Victory, in a glass case with an enclosed concealed light,\nwas a statue, greenish gray, a few inches tall, with a sneering\nplacidity of expression as notable as the sweep of the other white\nfragment. \"That's Chinese,\" her companion decided; \"it looks as old as\nlust.\" There was the stir of new arrivals--a towering heavy man with\na slight woman in emerald satin. \"There's Pleydon, the sculptor,\" the\nyouth told her animatedly. \"I've seen him at the exhibitions. It must be\nSusanna Noda, the Russian singer, with him. He's a tremendous swell.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nLinda watched Pleydon as he met Markue in the middle of the room. He was\ndressed carelessly, improperly for the evening; but she forgave that as\nthe result of indifference. The informal flannels and soft collar, too,\nsuited the largeness of his being and gestures. There was a murmur of\nmeeting, Susanna Noda smiled appealingly; and then, as Pleydon found a\nplace on a divan, she at once contentedly sat on his lap. Watching her,\nLinda thought of a brilliant parrot; but that was only the effect of her\ncolor; for her face, with a tilted nose and wide golden eyes, generous\nwarm lips, was charming. She lighted a cigarette, turned her graceful\nback on the room and company, and chatted in French to the composed\nsculptor.\n\nLinda divined that he was the most impressive figure she had\nencountered; the quality of his indifference was beautiful and could\nonly have come in the security of being a \"tremendous swell.\" That\nphrase described all for which she had cared most. It included\neverything that her mother had indicated as desirable and a lot that\nshe, Linda, had added. Money, certainly, was an absolute necessity;\nbut there were other things now that vaguely she desired. She tried to\ndecide what they were.\n\nOnly the old inner confusion resulted, the emotion that might have\nbeen born in music; however, it was sharper than usual, and bred a new\ndissatisfaction with the easier accomplishments. Really it was very\ndisturbing, for the pressure of her entire experience, all she had\nbeen told, could be exactly weighed and held. The term luxury, too, was\nrevealing; it covered everything--except her present unformed longing.\n\nThere were still newcomers, and Linda was aware of a sudden constraint.\nA woman volubly French had appeared with a long pinkish-white dog in a\nblanket, and the three Arabians--she had learned that much--had risen\nwith a concerted expression of surprise and displeasure. Their anxiety,\nthough, was no more dramatic than that of the dog's proprietor. The\ngesture of her hands and lifted eyebrows were keenly expressive of her\nimpatience with any one who couldn't accept, with her, her dog.\n\n\"Markue ought to have it out,\" some one murmured. \"Dogs, to high caste\nMohammedans, are unclean animals.\" Another added, \"Worse than that, if\nit should touch them, they would have to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.\"\n\nWithout any knowledge of the situation of Mecca, Linda yet realized that\nit must be a very long journey to result from the mere touch of a dog.\nShe didn't wonder at the restrained excitement of the \"colored\" people.\nThe situation was reduced to a sub-acid argument between the Frenchwoman\nand the Begum; Madame couldn't exist without her \"_p'tit_.\" The Oriental\nlady could not breathe a common air with the beast. The former managed a\nqualified triumph--the \"_p'tit_\" was caged with a chair in a corner, and\nthe episode, for the moment, dropped.\n\nSoon, however, Linda saw that the dog had wriggled out of captivity. It\nmade a cautious progress to where the candy stood on a low stand and\nran an appreciative tongue over the exposed sweet surfaces. Rapidly a\nsugared fig was snapped up. Linda held her breath; no one had noticed\nthe animal yet--perhaps it would reach one of the objectors and she\nwould have the thrill of witnessing the departure for Mecca.\n\nBut, as always, nothing so romantic occurred; the dog was discovered,\nand the Mohammedans, with a hurried politeness, made their salaams.\nInstead, a man with a quizzical scrutiny through glasses that made him\nresemble an owl, stopped before her.\n\n\"'Here we go 'round the mulberry-bush,'\" he chanted. \"Hello, Kate\nGreenaway. Have you had a drink?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you,\" she replied sedately.\n\n\"Certified milk?\"\n\n\"It was something with gin,\" she particularized, \"and too sweet.\" He\ntook the place beside her and solemnly recited a great many nursery\nrhymes. On the whole she liked him, deciding that he was very wicked.\nSoon he was holding her hand in both of his. \"I know you're not real,\"\nhe proceeded. \"Verlaine wrote you--_'Les Ingenus':_\n\n  \"'From which the sudden gleam of whiteness shed\n    Met in our eyes a frolic welcoming.'\n\n\"What if I'd kiss you?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" she returned coldly.\n\n\"You're remarkable!\" he exclaimed with enthusiasm. \"If you are not\nalready one of the celebrated beauties you're about to be. As cool as a\nfish! Look--Pleydon is going to rise and spill little Russia. Have you\nheard her sing Scriabine?\" Linda ignored him in a sharp return of her\ninterest in the big carelessly-dressed man. He put Susanna Noda aside\nand moved to the dim middle of the room. His features, Linda saw, were\nrugged and pronounced; he was very strong.\n\nFor a moment he stood gazing at the Winged Victory, his brow gathered\ninto a frown, while he made a caressing gesture with his whole hand.\nThen he swung about and, from the heavy shadows of his face, he looked\ndown at her. He was still for a disconcerting length of time, but\nthrough which Linda steadily met his interrogation. Then he bent over\nand seriously removed the man beside her.\n\n\"Adieu, Louis,\" he said.\n\nThe weight of Pleydon's body depressed the entire divan. \"An ordinary\nman,\" he told her, \"would ask how the devil you got here. Then he would\ntake you to your home with some carefully chosen words for whatever\nparents you had. But I can see that all this is needless. You are an\nextremely immaculate person.\n\n\"That isn't necessarily admirable,\" he added.\n\n\"I don't believe I am admirable at all,\" Linda replied.\n\n\"How old are you?\" he demanded abruptly.\n\nShe told him.\n\n\"Age doesn't exist for some women, they are eternal,\" he continued. \"You\nsee, I call you a woman, but you are not, and neither are you a child.\nYou are Art--Art the deathless,\" his gaze strayed back to the Victory.\n\nAs she, too, looked at it, it seemed to Linda that the cast filled\nall the room with a swirl of great white wings and heroic robes. In an\ninstant the incense and the dark colors, the uncertain pallid faces\nand bare shoulders, were swept away into a space through which she was\ndizzily borne. The illusion was so overpowering that involuntarily she\ncaught at the heavy arm by her.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\n\"Why did you do that?\" he asked quickly, with a frowning regard. Linda\nreplied easily and directly. \"It seemed as if it were carrying me with\nit,\" she specified; \"on and on and on, without ever stopping. I felt as\nif I were up among the stars.\" She paused, leaning forward, and gazed\nat the statue. Even now she was certain that she saw a slight flutter of\nits draperies. \"It is beautiful, isn't it? I think it's the first thing\nI ever noticed like that. You know what I mean--the first thing that\nhadn't a real use.\"\n\n\"But it has,\" he returned. \"Do you think it is nothing to be swept into\nheaven? I suppose by 'real' you mean oatmeal and scented soap. Women\nusually do. But no one, it appears, has any conception of the practical\nside of great art. You might try to remember that it is simply\npermanence given to beauty. It's like an amber in which beautiful and\nfragile things are kept forever in a lovely glow. That is all, and it is\nenough.\n\n\"When I said that you were Art I didn't mean that you were skilfully\npainted and dressed, but that there was a quality in you which recalled\nall the charming women who had ever lived to draw men out of the\nmud--something, probably, of which you are entirely unconscious, and\ncertainly beyond your control. You have it in a remarkable degree. It\ndoesn't belong to husbands but to those who create 'Homer's children.'\n\n\"That's a dark saying of Plato's, and it means that the _Alcestis_ is\ngreater than any momentary offspring of the flesh.\"\n\nLinda admitted seriously, \"Of course, I don't understand, yet it seems\nquite familiar--\"\n\n\"Don't, for Heaven's sake, repeat the old cant about reincarnation;\" he\ninterrupted, \"and sitting together, smeared with antimony, on a roof of\nBabylon.\"\n\nShe hadn't intended to, she assured him. \"Tell me about yourself,\" he\ndirected. It was as natural to talk with him as it was, with others,\nto keep still. Her frank speech flowed on and on, supported by the\nrealization of his attention.\n\n\"There really isn't much, besides hotels, all different; but you'd be\nsurprised how alike they were, too. I mean the things to eat, and the\npeople. I never realized how tired I was of them until mother married\nMr. Moses Feldt. The children were simply dreadful, the children and\nthe women; the men weren't much better.\" She said this in a tone of\nsurprise, and he nodded. \"I can see now--I am supposed to be too old for\nmy age, and it was the hotels. You learn a great deal.\"\n\n\"Do you like Mr. Moses Feldt?\"\n\n\"Enormously; he is terribly sweet. I intend to marry a man just like\nhim. Or, at least, he was the second kind I decided on: the first only\nhad money, then I chose one with money who was kind, but now I don't\nknow. It's very funny: kindness makes me impatient. I'm perfectly sure\nI'll never care for babies, they are so mussy. I don't read, and I can't\nstand being--well, loved.\n\n\"Mother went to a great many parties; every one liked her and she liked\nevery one back; so it was easy for her. I used to long for the time when\nI'd wear a lovely cloak and go out in a little shut motor with a man\nwith pearls; but now that's gone. They want to kiss you so much. I wish\nthat satisfied me. Why doesn't it? Is there anything the matter with me,\ndo you think? I've been told that I haven't any heart.\"\n\nAs he laughed at her she noticed how absurdly small a cigarette seemed\nin his broad powerful hand. \"What has happened to you is this,\" he\nexplained: \"a combination of special circumstances has helped you in\nevery way to be what, individually, you were. As a rule, children are\nbrought up in a house of lies, like taking a fine naked body and binding\nit into hideous rigid clothes. You escaped the damnation of cheap\nready-cut morals and education. Your mother ought to have a superb\nmonument--the perfect parent. Of course you haven't a 'heart.' From the\nstandpoint of nature and society you're as depraved as possible. You are\nworse than any one else here--than all of them rolled together.\"\n\nCuriously, she thought, this didn't disturb her, which proved at once\nthat he was right. Linda regarded herself with interest as a supremely\nreprehensible person, perhaps a vampire. The latter, though, was a\nrather stout woman who, dressed in frightful lingerie, occupied couches\nwith her arms caught about the neck of a man bending over her. Every\ndetail of this was distasteful.\n\nWhat was she?\n\nHer attention wandered to the squat Chinese god in the glass case. It\nwas clear that he hadn't stirred for ages. A difficult thought partly\nformed in her mind--the Chinese was the god of this room, of Markue's\nparty, of the women seated in the dim light on the floor and the divans;\nthe low gurgle of their laughter, the dusky whiteness of their shoulders\nin the upcoiling incense, the smothered gleams of their hair, with the\nwhispering men, were the world of the grayish-green image.\n\nShe explained this haltingly to Pleydon, who listened with a flattering\ninterest. \"I expect you're laughing at me inside,\" she ended impotently.\n\"And the other, the Greek Victory,\" he added, \"is the goddess of the\nother world, of the spirit. It's quaint a heathen woman should be that.\"\n\nLinda discovered that she liked Pleydon enormously. She continued\ndaringly that he might be the sort of man she wanted to marry. But he\nwouldn't be easy to manage; probably he could not be managed at all. Her\nmother had always insisted upon the presence of that possibility in any\ncandidate for matrimony. And, until now, Linda's philosophy had been in\naccord with her. But suddenly she entertained the idea of losing herself\ncompletely in--in love.\n\nA struggle was set up within her: on one hand was everything that she\nhad been, all her experience, all advice, and her innate detachment;\non the other an obscure delicious thrill. Perhaps this was what she now\nwanted. Linda wondered if she could try it--just a little, let herself\ngo experimentally. She glanced swiftly at Pleydon, and his bulk, his\nheavy features, the sullen mouth, appalled her.\n\nMen usually filled her with an unaccountable shrinking into her remotest\nself. Pleydon was different; her liking for him had destroyed a large\npart of her reserve; but a surety of instinct told her that she couldn't\nexperiment there. It was characteristic that a lesser challenge left her\ncold. She had better marry as she had planned.\n\nSusanna Noda came up petulantly and sank in a brilliant graceful swirl\nat his feet. Her golden eyes, half shut, studied Linda intently.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\n\"I am fatigued,\" she complained; \"you know how weary I get when you\nignore me.\" He gazed down at her untouched. \"I have left Lao-tze for\nGreece,\" he replied. She found this stupid and said so. \"Has he been no\nmore amusing than this?\" she asked Linda. \"But then, you are a child,\nit all intrigues you. You listen with the flattery of your blue eyes and\nmouth, both open.\"\n\n\"Don't be rude, Susanna,\" Pleydon commanded. \"You are so feminine that\nyou are foolish. I'm not the stupid one--look again at our 'child.' Tell\nme what you see.\"\n\n\"I see Siberia,\" she said finally. \"I see the snow that seems so pure\nwhile it is as blank and cold as death. You are right, Dodge. I was the\ndull one. This girl will be immensely loved; perhaps by you. A calamity,\nI promise you. Men are pigs,\" she turned again to Linda; \"no--imbeciles,\nfor only idiots destroy the beauty that is given to them. They take your\nreputation with a smile, they take your heart with iron fingers; your\nbeauty they waste like a drunken Russian with gold.\"\n\n\"Susanna, like all spendthrifts, is amazed by poverty.\"\n\nEven in the gloom Linda could see the pallor spreading over the other's\nface; she was glad that Susanna Noda spoke in Russian. However, with a\nviolent effort, she subdued her bitterness. \"Go into your Siberia!\" she\ncried. \"I always thought you were capable of the last folly of marriage.\nIf you do it will spoil everything. You are not great, you know, not\nreally great, not in the first rank. You've only the slightest chance of\nthat, too much money. You were never in the gutter as I was--\"\n\n\"Chateaubriand,\" he interrupted, \"Dante, Velasquez.\"\n\n\"No, not spiritually!\" she cried again. \"What do you know of the\ninferno! Married, you will get fat.\" Pleydon turned lightly to Linda:\n\n\"As a supreme favor do not, when I ask you, marry me.\"\n\nThis, for Linda, was horribly embarrassing. However, she gravely\npromised. The Russian lighted a cigarette; almost she was serene again.\nLinda said, \"Fatness is awful, isn't it?\"\n\nPleydon replied, \"Death should be the penalty. If women aren't lovely--\"\nhe waved away every other consideration.\n\n\"And if men have fingers like carrots--\" Susanna mimicked him. Judith,\nflushed, her hair loosened, approached. \"Linda,\" she demanded, \"do you\nremember when we ordered the taxi? Was it two or three?\" Markue, at her\nshoulder, begged her not to consider home.\n\n\"I'm going almost immediately,\" Pleydon said, \"and taking your Linda.\"\nHis height and determined manner scattered all objections.\n\nLinda, at the entrance to the apartment, found to her great surprise--in\nplace of the motor she had expected--a small graceful single-horse\nvictoria, the driver buttoned into a sealskin rug. Deep in furs, beside\nPleydon, she was remarkably comfortable, and she was soothed by the\nrhythmic beat of the hoofs, the even progress through the crystal night\nof Fifth Avenue.\n\nHer companion flooded his being with the frozen air. They had, it\nseemed, lost all desire to talk. The memory of Markue's party lingered\nlike the last vanishing odor of his incense; there was a confused vision\nof the murmurous room against the lighted exterior where the drinks\nsparkled on a table. Linda made up her mind that she would not go to\nanother. Then she wondered if she'd see Pleydon again. The Russian\nsinger had been too silly for words.\n\nIt suddenly occurred to her that the man now with her had taken Susanna\nNoda, and that he had left her planted. He had preferred driving her,\nLinda Condon, home. He wasn't very enthusiastic about it, though; his\nface was gloomy.\n\n\"The truth is,\" he remarked at last, \"that Susanna is right--I am not\nin the first rank. But that was all nonsense about the necessity of the\ngutter--sentimental lies.\"\n\nLinda was not interested in this, but it left her free to explore her\nown emotions. The night had been eventful because it had shaken all the\nfoundation of what she intended. That single momentary delicious thrill\nhad been enough to threaten the entire rest. At the same time her native\ncontempt of the other women, of Judith with her tumbled hair, persisted.\nWas there no other way to capture such happiness? Was it all hopelessly\nmessy with drinks and unpleasant familiarity?\n\nWhat did Pleydon mean by spirit? Surely there must be more kinds of love\nthan one--he had intimated that. She gathered that \"Homer's children,\"\nthose airs of Gluck that she liked so well, were works of art,\nsculpture, such as he did. Yet she had never thought of them as\nimportant, important as oatmeal or delicate soap. She made up her mind\nto ask him about it, when she saw that they had reached the Eighties;\nshe was almost home.\n\n\"I am going away to-morrow,\" he told her, \"for the winter, to South\nAmerica. When I come back we'll see each other. If you should change\naddress send me a line to the Harvard Club.\" The carriage had stopped\nbefore the great arched entrance to the apartment-house, towering in its\nentire block. He got out and lifted her to the pavement as if she had\nbeen no more than a flower in his hands. Then he walked with her into\nthe darkness of the garden.\n\nThe fountains were cased in boards; the hedged borders, the bushes and\ngrass, were dead. High above them on the dark wall a window was bright.\nLinda's heart began to pound loudly, she was trembling ... from the\ncold. There was a faint sound in the air--the elevated trains, or\nstirring wings? It was nothing, then, to be lifted into heaven. There\nwas the door to the hall and elevator. She turned, to thank Dodge\nPleydon for all his goodness to her, when he lifted her--was it toward\nheaven?--and kissed her mouth.\n\nShe was still in his arms, with her eyes closed. \"Linda Condon?\" he\nsaid, in a tone of inquiry.\n\nAt the same breath in which she realized a kiss was of no importance a\nsharp icy pain cut at her heart. It hurt her so that she gasped. Then,\nand this was strange, she realized that--as a kiss--it hadn't annoyed\nher. Suddenly she felt that it wasn't just that, but something far more,\na part of all her inner longing. He had put her down and was looking\naway, a face in shadow with an ugly protruding lip.\n\nShe saw him that way in her dreams--in the court under the massive\nsomber walls, with a troubled frown over his eyes. It seemed to her\nthat, reaching up, she smoothed it away as they stood together in a\ndarkness with the fountains, the hedges, dead, the world with never a\nsound sleeping in the prison of winter.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nLinda thought about Dodge Pleydon on a warm evening of the following\nMay. At four o'clock, in a hotel, Pansy had been married; and the entire\nFeldt connection had risen to a greater height of clamorous cheer than\never before. Extravagant unseasonable dishes, wines and banked flowers\nwere lavishly mingled with sentimental speeches, healths and tears.\nLinda had been acutely restless, impatient of all the loud good humor\nand stupid compliments. The sense of her isolation from their life was\nunbearably keen. She would have a very different wedding with a man in\nno particular like Pansy's.\n\nAfter dinner--an occasion, with Pansy absent, where Mr. Moses Feldt's\ntears persisted in flowing--she had strayed into the formal chamber\nacross from the dining-room and leaned out of a window, gazing into the\ndarkening court. Directly below was where Pleydon had kissed her. She\noften re-examined her feelings about that; but only to find that they\nhad dissolved into an indefinite sense of the inevitable. Not alone had\nit failed to shock her--she hadn't even been surprised. Linda thought\nstill further about kissing, with the discovery that if, while it was\nhappening, she was conscious of the kiss, it was a failure; successful,\nit carried her as far as possible from the actuality.\n\nPleydon, of course, had not written to her; he had intimated nothing to\nthe contrary, only asking her to let him know, at the Harvard Club, if\nshe changed address. That wasn't necessary, and now, probably, he was\nback from South America. Where, except by accident, might she see him?\nMarkue, with his parties, had dropped from Judith's world, his place\ntaken by a serious older dealer in Dutch masters with an impressive\ngallery just off Fifth Avenue.\n\nThat she would see him Linda was convinced; this feeling absorbed any\ndesire; it was no good wanting it or not wanting it; consequently she\nwas undisturbed. She considered him gravely and in detail. Had there\nbeen any more Susanna Nodas in his stay south? She had heard somewhere\nthat the women of Argentine were irresistible. Her life had taught her\nnothing if not the fact that a number of women figured in every man's\nhistory. It was deplorable but couldn't be avoided; and whether or not\nit continued after marriage depended on the cunning of any wife.\n\nNow, however, Linda felt weary already at the prospect of a married life\nthat rested on the constant play of her ingenuity. A great many things\nthat, but a little before, she had willingly accepted, seemed to her\nprobably not less necessary but distinctly tiresome. Linda began to\nthink that she couldn't really bother; the results weren't sufficiently\nimportant.\n\nDodge Pleydon.\n\nShe slept in a composed order until the sun was well up. It was warmer\nthan yesterday; and, going to an afternoon concert with Judith, she\ndecided to walk. Linda strolled, in a short severe jacket and skirt, a\nblack straw hat turned back with a cockade and a crisp flushed mass of\nsweet peas at her waist. The occasion, as it sometimes happened, found\nher in no mood for music. The warmth of the sunlight, the open city\nwindows and beginning sounds of summer, had enveloped her in a mood in\nwhich the jangling sentimentality of a street organ was more potent than\nthe legato of banked violins.\n\nShe was relieved when the concert was over, but lingered at her seat\nuntil the crowd had surged by; it made Linda furious to be shoved\nor indiscriminately touched. Judith had gone ahead, when Linda was\nconscious of the scrutiny of a pale well-dressed woman of middle age.\nIt became evident that the other was debating whether or not to speak;\nclearly such an action was distasteful to her; and Linda had turned away\nbefore a restrained voice addressed her:\n\n\"You will have to forgive me if I ask your name ... because of a certain\nresemblance. Seeing you I--I couldn't let you go.\"\n\n\"Linda Condon,\" she replied.\n\nThe elder, Linda saw, grew even paler. She put out a gloved hand. \"Then\nI was right,\" she said in a slightly unsteady voice. \"But perhaps, when\nI explain, you will think it even stranger, inexcusable. My dear child,\nI am your father's sister.\"\n\nLinda was invaded by a surprise equally made up of interest and\nresentment. The first was her own and the second largely borrowed\nfrom her mother. Besides, why had her father's family never made the\nslightest effort to see her. This evidently had simultaneously occurred\nto the other.\n\n\"Of course,\" she added, quite properly, \"we can't undertake family\nquestions here. I shouldn't blame you a bit, either, if you went\ndirectly away. I had to speak, to risk that, because you were so\nunmistakably a Lowrie. It is not a common appearance. We--I--\" she\nfloundered for a painful moment; then she gathered herself with a\nconsiderable dignity. \"Seeing you has affected me tremendously, changed\neverything. I have nothing to say in our defense, you must understand\nthat. I am certain, too, that my sister will feel the same--we live\ntogether in Philadelphia. I hope you will give me your address and let\nus write to you. Elouise will join with me absolutely.\"\n\nLinda told her evenly where she lived, and then allowed Miss Lowrie to\nprecede her toward the entrance. She said nothing of this to Judith,\nnor, momentarily, to her mother. She wanted to consider it undisturbed\nby a flood of talk and blame. It was evident to her that the Lowries had\nbehaved very badly, but just how she couldn't make out. She recalled her\nfather's sister--her aunt--minutely, forced to the realization that she\nwas a person of entire superiority. Here, she suddenly saw, had been\nthe cause of all their difficulties--the Lowries hadn't approved of the\nmarriage, they had objected to her mother.\n\nFive years ago she would have been incensed at this; but now,\nessentially, she was without personal indignation. She wanted, for\nherself, to discover as much as possible about her father and his\nfamily. A need independent of maternal influences stirred her. Linda was\nreassured by the fact that her father had been gently born; while she\nrealized that she had always taken this for granted. Her mother must\nknow nothing about the meeting with Miss Lowrie until the latter had\nwritten.\n\nThat was Friday and the letter came the following Tuesday. Linda, alone\nat the breakfast-table, instantly aware of the source of the square\nenvelope addressed in a delicate regular writing, opened it and read in\nan unusual mental disturbance:\n\n\"My dear Linda,\n\nI hope you will not consider it peculiar for me to call you this,\nfor nothing else seems possible. Meeting you in that abrupt manner upset\nme, as you must have noticed. Of course I knew of you, and even now I\ncan not go into our long unhappy affair, but until I saw you, and so\nremarkably like the Lowries, I did not realize how wicked Elouise and I\nhad been. But I am obliged to add only where you were concerned. We have\nno desire to be ambiguous in that.\n\nHowever, I am writing to say that we should love to have you visit us\nhere. It is possible under the circumstances that your mother will not\nwish you to come. Yet I know the Lowries, a very independent and\ndecided family, and although it is my last intention to be the cause of\ndifficulty with your mother, still I hope it may be arranged.\n\nIn closing I must add how happy I was at the evidence of your blood.\nBut that, I now see, was a certainty. You will have to forgive us for a\nlarge measure of blindness. Affectionately,\n\nAMELIA VIGN\u00c3\u0089 LOWRIE.\"\n\n\nAlmost instantaneously Linda was aware that she would visit the Lowries.\nShe liked the letter extremely, as well as all that she remembered of\nits sender. At the same time she prepared for a scene with her mother,\ndifferent from those of the past--with the recourse to the brandy\nflask--but no less unpleasant. They had very little to say to each other\nnow; and, when she went into her mother's room with an evident definite\npurpose, the latter showed a constrained surprise, a palpable annoyance\nthat her daughter had found her at the daily renovation of her worn\nface.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nLinda said directly, \"I met Miss Lowrie, father's sister, at a concert\nlast week, and this morning I had a letter asking me to stay with them\nin Philadelphia.\"\n\nMrs. Feldt's face suddenly had no need for the color she held poised\non a cloth. Her voice, sharp at the beginning, rose to a shrill\nunrestrained wrath.\n\n\"I wonder at the brass of her speaking to you at all let alone writing\nhere. Just you give me the letter and I'll shut her up. The idea! I hope\nyou were cool to her, the way they treated us. Stay with them--I guess\nnot!\"\n\n\"But I thought of going,\" Linda replied. \"It's only natural. After all,\nyou must see that he was my father.\"\n\n\"A pretty father he was, too good for the girl he married. It's my fault\nI didn't tell you long ago, but I just couldn't abide the mention of\nhim. He deserted me, no, us, cold, without a word--walked out of the\ndoor one noon, taking his hat as quiet as natural, and never came back.\nI never saw him again nor heard except through lawyers. That was the\nkind of heart he had, and his sisters are worse. I hadn't a decent\nspeech of any kind out of them. The Lowries,\" she managed to inject a\nsurprising amount of contempt into her pronouncement of that name. \"What\nit was all about you nor any sensible person would never believe:\n\n\"The house smelled a little of boiled cabbage. That's why he left me,\nand you expected in a matter of a few months. He said in his dam' frigid\nway that it had become quite impossible and took down his hat.\"\n\n\"There must have been more,\" Linda protested, suppressing a mad desire\nto laugh.\n\n\"Not an inch,\" her mother asserted. \"Nothing, after a little, suited\nhim. He'd sit up like a poker, just as I've seen you, with his lips\ntight together in the Lowrie manner. It didn't please him no matter what\nyou'd do. He wouldn't blow out at you like a Christian and I never knew\nwhere I was at. I'd come down in a matin\u00c3\u00a9e, the prettiest I could buy,\nand then see he didn't like it. He would expect you to be dressed in the\nmorning like it was afternoon and you going out. And as for loosening\nyour corsets for a little comfort about the house, you might as well\nhave slapped him direct.\n\n\"That wasn't the worst, though; but his going away without as much as a\nflicker of his hand; and with me like I was. Nobody on earth but would\nblame him for that. I only got what was allowed me after we had changed\nback to my old name, me and you. He never asked one single question\nabout you nor tried to see or serve you a scrap. For all he knew, at a\nplace called Santa Margharita in Italy, you might have been born dead.\"\n\nShe was unable, Linda recognized, to defend him in any way; he had acted\nfrightfully. She acknowledged this logically with her power of reason,\nbut somehow it didn't touch her as it had her mother, and as, evidently,\nthe latter expected. She was absorbed in the vision of her father\nsitting, in the Lowrie manner, rigid as a poker; she saw him quietly\ntake up his hat and go away forever. Linda understood his process\ncompletely; she was capable of doing precisely the same thing. Whatever\nwas the matter with her--in the heartlessness so often laid to her\naccount--had been equally true of her father.\n\n\"You ought to know what to say to them,\" Mrs. Moses Feldt cried, \"or\nI'll do it for you! If only I had seen her she would have heard a thing\nor two not easy forgotten.\"\n\nLinda's determination to go to Philadelphia had not been shaken, and she\nmade a vain effort to explain her attitude. \"Of course, it was horrid\nfor you,\" she said. \"I can understand how you'd never never forgive him.\nBut I am different, and, I expect, not at all nice. It's very possible,\nsince he was my father, that we are alike. I wish you had told me this\nbefore--it explains so much and would have made things easier for me. I\nam afraid I must see them.\"\n\nShe was aware of the bitterness and enmity that stiffened her mother\ninto an unaccustomed adequate scorn:\n\n\"I might have expected nothing better of you, and me watching it coming\nall these years. You can go or stay. I had my life in spite of the both\nof you, as gay as I pleased and a good husband just the same. I don't\ncare if I never see you again, and if it wasn't for the fuss it would\nmake I'd take care I didn't. You'll have your father's money now I'm\nmarried; I wonder you stay around here at all with your airs of being\nbetter than the rest. God's truth is you ain't near as good, even if I\ndid bring you into the world.\"\n\n\"I am willing to agree with you,\" Linda answered. \"No one could be\nsweeter than the Feldts. I sha'n't do nearly as well. But that isn't\nit, really. People don't choose themselves; I'm certain father didn't at\nthat lonely Italian place. If you weren't happy laced in the morning it\nwasn't your fault. You see, I am trying to excuse myself, and that isn't\nany good, either.\"\n\n\"Unnatural,\" Mrs. Moses Feldt pronounced. And Linda, weary and\ndepressed, allowed her the last word.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nNothing further during the subsequent brief exchange of notes between\nMiss Lowrie and Linda was said of the latter's intention to visit her\nfather's family. Mrs. Feldt, however, whose attitude toward Linda had\nbeen negatively polite, now displayed an animosity carefully hidden from\nher husband but evident to the two girls. The elder never neglected an\nopportunity to emphasize Linda's selfishness or make her personality\nseem ridiculous. But this Linda ignored from her wide sense of the\ninconsequence of most things.\n\nYet she was relieved when, finally, she had actually left New York. She\nlooked forward with an unusual hopeful curiosity to the Lowries. To\nher surprise their house--miles, it appeared, from the center of the\ncity--was directly on a paved street with electric cars, unpretentious\nstores and very humble dwellings nearby. Back from the thoroughfare,\nhowever, there were spacious green lawns. The street itself, she saw\nat once, was old--a highway of gray stone with low aged stone fa\u00c3\u00a7ades,\nsteep eaves and blackened chimney-pots reaching, dusty with years, into\nthe farther hilly country.\n\nA gable of the Lowrie house, with a dignified white door, a fanlight of\nfaintly iridescent glass and polished brasses, faced the brick sidewalk,\nwhile to the left there was a high board fence and an entrance with a\nsmall grille open on a somber reach of garden. A maid in a stiff white\ncap answered the fall of the knocker; she took Linda's bag; and, in a\nhall that impressed her by its bareness, Linda was greeted by the Miss\nLowrie she had seen.\n\nHer aunt was composed, but there was a perceptible flush on her cheeks,\nand she said in a rapid voice, after a conventional welcome, \"You must\nmeet Elouise at once, before you go up to your room.\"\n\nElouise Lowrie was older than Amelia, but she, too, was slender\nand erect, with black hair startling in its density on her wasted\ncountenance. Linda noticed a fine ruby on a crooked finger and beautiful\nrose point lace. \"It was good of you,\" the elder proceeded, \"to come and\nsee two old women. I don't know whether we have more to say or to keep\nstill about. But I, for one, am going to avoid explanations. You are\nhere, a fool could see that you were Bartram's girl, and that is enough\nfor a Lowrie.\"\n\nThe room was nearly as bare as the hall: in place of the deep carpets of\nthe Feldts' the floor, of dark uneven oak boards, was merely waxed and\ncovered by a rough-looking oval rug. The walls were paneled in white,\nwith white ruffled curtains at small windows; and the furniture, the\ndull mahogany ranged against the immaculate paint, the rocking-chairs\nof high slatted walnut and rush bottoms, the slender formality of tables\nwith fluted legs, was dignified but austere. There were some portraits\nin heavy old gilt--men with florid faces and tied hair, and the delicate\nreplicas of high-breasted women in brocades.\n\nThere was, plainly, an air of the exceptional in Amelia Lowrie's\nconduction of Linda to her room. She waited at the door while the other\nmoved forward to the center of a chamber empty of all the luxury Linda\nhad grown to demand. There was a bed with tall graceful posts supporting\na canopy like a frosting of sugar, a solemn set of drawers with a\ndiminutive framed mirror in which she could barely see her shoulders,\na small unenclosed brass clock with long exposed weights, and two\nuninviting painted wooden chairs. This was not, although very nearly,\nall. Linda's attention was attracted by a framed and long-faded\nphotograph of a young man, bareheaded, with a loosely knotted scarf, a\nstriped blazer and white flannels. His face was thin and sensitive,\nhis lips level, and his eyes gazed with a steady questioning at the\nobserver.\n\n\"That was Bartram,\" Amelia Lowrie told her; \"your father. This was his\nroom.\"\n\nShe went down almost immediately and left Linda, in a maze of dim\nemotions, seated on one of the uncomfortable painted chairs. Her father!\nThis was his room; nothing, she realized, had been disturbed. The mirror\nhad held the vaguely unsteady reflection of his face; he had slept under\nthe arched canopy of the bed. She rose and went to a window from which\nhe, too, had looked.\n\nBelow her was the garden shut in on its front by the high fence. There\nwas a magnolia-tree, now covered with thick smooth white flowers, and,\nat the back, low-massed rhododendron with fragile lavender blossoms on\na dark glossy foliage. But the space was mainly green and shadowed\nin tone; while beyond were other gardens, other emerald lawns and\nmagnolia-trees, an ordered succession of tranquillity with separate\nbrick or stone or white dwellings in the lengthening afternoon shadows\nof vivid maples.\n\nIt was as different as possible from all that Linda had known, from the\nelaborate hotels and gigantic apartment houses, the tropical interiors,\nof her New York life. She unpacked her bag, putting her gold toilet\nthings on the chest of drawers, precisely arranging in a shallow closet\nwhat clothes she had brought, and then, changing, went down to the\nLowries.\n\nThey surveyed her with eminent approval at a dinner-table lighted only\nwith candles, beside long windows open on a dusk with a glimmer of\nfireflies. Suddenly Linda felt amazingly at ease; it seemed to her\nthat she had sat here before, with the night flowing gently in over the\ncandle-flames. The conversation, she discovered, never strayed far\nfrom the concerns and importance of the Lowrie blood. \"My grandmother,\nNatalie Vign\u00c3\u00a9,\" Elouise informed her, \"came with her father to\nPhiladelphia from France, in eighteen hundred and one, at the invitation\nof Stephen Girard, who was French as well. She married Hallet Lowrie\nwhose mother was a Bartram.\n\n\"That, my dear, explains our black hair and good figgers. There never\nwas a lumpy Lowrie. Well, Hallet built this house, or rather enlarged\nit, for his wife; and it has never been out of the family. Our nephew,\nArnaud Hallet--Arnaud was old Vign\u00c3\u00a9's name--owns it now. Isaac Hallet,\nyou may recall, was suspected of being a Tory; at any rate his brother's\ndescendants, Fanny Rodwell is the only one left, won't speak.\"\n\nThe placid conversation ran on unchanged throughout dinner and the\nevening. Linda was relieved by the absence of any questioning; indeed\nnothing contemporary, she realized, was held to be significant. \"I\nthought Arnaud would be in to-night,\" Elouise Lowrie said; \"he knew\nLinda was expected.\" No one, however, appeared; and Linda went up early\nto her room. There, too, were only candles, a pale wavering illumination\nin which the past, her father, were extraordinarily nearby. A sense of\npride was communicated to her by so much that time had been unable to\nshake. The bed was steeped in the magic of serene traditions.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nArnaud Hallet appeared for dinner the evening after Linda's arrival;\na quiet man with his youth lost, slightly stooped shoulders, crumpled\nshoes and a green cloth bag. But he had a memorable voice and an easy\ndistinction of manner; in addition to these she discovered, at the\ntable, a lighter amusing sense of the absurd. She watched him--as\nhe poured the sherry from a decanter with a silver label hung on a\nchain--with a feeling of mild approbation. On the whole he was nice but\nuninteresting. What a different man from Pleydon!\n\nThe days passed in a pleasant deliberation, with Arnaud Hallet\nconstantly about the house or garden, while Linda's thoughts continually\nreturned to the sculptor. He was clearer than the actuality of her\nmother and the Feldts or the recreated image of her father. At times she\nwas thrilled by the familiar obscure sense of music, of longing slowly\ntranslated into happiness. Then more actual problems would envelop her\nin doubt. Mostly she was confused--in her cool material necessity for\nunderstanding--by the temper of her feeling for Dodge Pleydon. Linda\nwondered if this were love. Perhaps, when she saw him again, she'd be\nable to decide. Then she remembered promising to let him know if she\nchanged her address. It was possible that already he had called at the\nFeldts', or written, and that her mother had refused to inform him where\nshe had gone.\n\nLinda had been at the Lowries' two weeks now, but they were acutely\ndistressed when she suggested that her visit was unreasonably prolonged.\n\"My dear,\" they protested together, \"we hoped you'd stay the summer.\nBartram's girl! Unless, of course, it is dull with us. Something\nbrighter must be arranged. No doubt we have only thought of our own\npleasure in having you.\"\n\nLinda replied honestly that she enjoyed being with them extremely. Her\nmother's dislike, the heavy luxury of the Feldt apartment, held little\nattraction for her. Then, too, losing the sense of the bareness of the\nhouse Hallet Lowrie had built for his French wife, she began to find it\nsurprisingly appealing.\n\nHer mind returned to her promise to Pleydon. She told herself\nthat probably he had forgotten her existence, but she had a strong\nunreasoning conviction that this was not so. It seemed the most natural\nthing in the world to write him and, almost before she was aware of\nthe intention, she had put \"Dear Mr. Pleydon\" at the head of a sheet of\nnote-paper.\n\nI promised to let you know in the spring when you came back from South\nAmerica where I was. I did not think I would have to do it, but here I\nam in Philadelphia with my father's sisters. I do not know just how long\nfor, but a month, anyhow. It is very quiet, but charming. I have the\nroom that was my father's when he was young, and look out of the window\nlike he must have. If you should come to Philadelphia my aunts ask me to\nsay that they would be glad to have you for dinner. This is how you get\nhere....\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nLINDA CONDON.\n\nShe walked to a street crossing, where she dropped the envelope into a\nletter-box on a lamppost, and returned to find Arnaud Hallet waiting for\nher. He said:\n\n\"Everyone agrees I'm serious, but actually you are worse than the\nAssembly.\" They went through the dining-room to the garden, and sat\non the stone step of a deep window. It was quite late, perhaps eleven\no'clock, and the fireflies, slowly rising into the night, had vanished.\nLinda was cool and remote and grave, silently repeating and weighing the\nphrases of her letter to Pleydon.\n\nShe realized that Arnaud Hallet was coming to like her a very great\ndeal; but she gave this only the slightest attention. She liked him,\nreally, and that dismissed him from serious consideration. Anyhow,\nin spite of the perfection of his manner, Arnaud's careless dress\ndispleased her: his shoes and the shoulders of his coat were perpetually\ndusty, and his hair, growing scant, was always ruffled. Linda understood\nthat he was highly intellectual, and frequently contributed historical\nand genealogical papers to societies and bulletins, but compared with\nDodge Pleydon's brilliant personality and reputation, Pleydon surrounded\nby the Susanna Nodas of life, Arnaud was as dingy as his shoes.\n\nShe wondered idly when the latter would actually try to love her. He was\nholding her hand and it might well be to-night. Linda decided that he\nwould do it delicately; and when, almost immediately, he kissed her, she\nwas undisturbed. No, surprisingly, it had been quite pleasant. He hadn't\nmussed her ribbons, nor her spirit, a particle. In addition he did not\nat once become impossible and urgently sentimental; there was even a\nshade of amusement on his heavy face.\n\n\"You appear to take a lot for granted,\" he complained.\n\n\"I'd been wondering when it would happen,\" she admitted coolly.\n\n\"It always does, then?\"\n\n\"Usually I stop it,\" she continued. \"I don't believe I'll ever like\nbeing kissed. Can you tell me why? No one ever has; they all think they\ncan bring me around to it.\"\n\n\"And to them,\" he added.\n\n\"But they end by being furious at me. I've been sworn at and called\ndreadful names. Sometimes they're only silly. One cried; I hated that\nthe most.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you were sorry for him?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no. Why should I be? He looked so odious all smeared with\ntears.\"\n\nArnaud Hallet returned promptly: \"Linda, you're a little beast.\" To\ncounteract his rude speech he kissed her again. \"This,\" he said with\nless security, \"threatens to become a habit. I thought, at forty-five,\nthat I was safely by the island of sirens, but I'll be on the rocks\nbefore I know it.\"\n\nShe laughed with the cool remoteness of running water.\n\n\"I wonder you haven't been murdered,\" he proceeded, \"in a moonless\ngarden by an elderly lawyer. Do you ever think of the lyric day when,\npreceded by a flock of bridesmaids and other flowery pagan truck, you'll\nmeet justice?\"\n\n\"Marriage?\" she asked. \"But of course. I have everything perfectly\nplanned--\"\n\n\"Then, my dear Linda, describe him.\"\n\n\"Very straight,\" she said, \"with beautiful polished shoes and brushed\nhair.\"\n\n\"You ought to have no trouble finding that. Any number of my friends\nhave one--to open the door and take your things. I might arrange a very\nsatisfactory introduction for everybody concerned--a steady man well on\nhis way to preside over the pantry and table.\"\n\n\"You're not as funny as usual,\" Linda decided critically. \"That, too,\ndisturbs me,\" he replied. \"It looks even more unpromising for the near\nfuture.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nIn her room Linda thought, momentarily, of Arnaud Hallet; whatever might\nhave been serious in her attitude toward him dissolved by the lightness\nof his speech. Dodge Pleydon appealed irresistibly to her deepest\nfeelings. Now her mental confusion was at least clear in that she knew\nwhat troubled her. It was not new, it extended even to times before\nPleydon had entered her life--the difficulties presented by the term\n\"love.\"\n\nIn her mind it was divided into two or three widely different aspects,\nphases which she was unable to reconcile. Her mother, in the beginning,\nhad informed her that love was a nuisance. To be happy, a man must love\nyou without any corresponding return; this was necessary to his complete\nmanagement, the securing of the greatest possible amount of new clothes.\nIt was as far as love should be allowed to enter marriage. But that\nreality, with a complete expression in shopping, was distant from the\nimmaterial and delicate emotions that in her responded to Pleydon.\n\nLinda had been familiar with the materials, the processes, of what, she\nhad been assured, was veritable love since early childhood. Her mother's\ndressing, the irritable hours of fittings and at her mirror, the paint\nshe put on her cheeks, the crimping of her hair were for the favor of\nmen. These struggles had absorbed the elder, all the women Linda had\nencountered, to the exclusion of everything else. This, it seemed, must,\nfrom its overwhelming predominance, be the greatest thing in life.\n\nThere was nothing mysterious about it. You did certain things\nintelligently, if you had the figure to do them with, for a practical\nend. The latter, carefully controlled, like an essence of which a drop\nwas delightful and more positively stifling, was as real as the\nmethods of approach. Oatmeal or scented soap! The force of example and\nassociation combined to bathe such developments in the sanest light\npossible, and Linda had every intention of the successful grasping of an\neasy and necessary luxury. She had, until--vaguely--now, been entirely\nwilling to accept the unescapable conditions of love used as a means or\nthe element of pleasure at parties. Now, however, the unexpected element\nof Dodge Pleydon disturbed her philosophy.\n\nSuddenly all the lacing and painting and crimping, the pretense and lies\nand carefully planned accidental effects, filled her with revolt. The\ninsinuations of women, the bareness of their revelations, her\nmother returning unsteady and mussed from a dinner, were unutterably\ndisgusting. Even to think of them hurt her fundamentally: so much of\nwhat she was, of what she had determined, had been destroyed by an\nemotion apparently as slight as echoed music.\n\nHere was the real mystery and for which nothing in her experience had\nprepared her. She began to see why it was called a nuisance--if this\nwere love--and wondered if she had better not suppress it at once. It\nwouldn't be suppressed. Her thoughts continually came back to Pleydon,\nand the warmth, the disturbing thrill, always resulted. It led her away\nfrom herself, from Linda Condon; a sufficiently strange accomplishment.\nA concern for Dodge Pleydon, little schemes for his happiness and\nwell-being, put aside her clothes and complexion and her future.\n\nUntil the present her acts had been the result of deliberation. She had\nbeen impressed by the necessity for planning with care; but, in the cool\ngloom of the covered bed, a sharp joy held her at the possibility of\nflinging caution away. Yet she couldn't quite, no matter how much she\ndesired it, lose herself. Linda was glad that Pleydon was rich; and\nthere were, she remembered, moments for surrender.\n\nAs usual these problems, multiplying toward night, were fewer in the\nbright flood of morning. She laughed at the memory of Arnaud Hallet's\nhumor; and then, it was late afternoon, the maid told her that Pleydon\nwas in the drawing room. Her appearance satisfactory she was able to see\nhim at once. To her great pleasure neither Pleydon nor his clothes had\nchanged. He was dressed in light-gray flannels; a big easy man with a\ncrushing palm, large features and an expression of intolerance.\n\n\"Linda,\" he said, \"what a splendid place to find you. So much better\nthan Markue's.\" He was, she realized, very glad to see her, and dropped\nat once, as if they had been uninterruptedly together, into intimate\ntalk. \"My work has been going badly,\" he proceeded; \"or rather not at\nall. I made a rather decent fountain at Newport; but--remember what\nSusanna said?--it's not in the first rank. A happy balance and strong\nenough conception; yet it is like a Cellini ewer done in granite. The\ntruth is, too much interests me; an artist ought to be the victim of a\nmonomania. I'm a normal animal.\" He studied her contentedly:\n\n\"How lovely you are. I came over--in an automobile at last--because I\nwas certain you couldn't exist as I remembered you. But you could and\ndo. Lovely Linda! And what a gem of a letter. It might have been copied\nfrom 'The Perfect Correspondent for Young Females.' You're not going to\nlose me again. When I was a little boy I had a passion for sherbets.\"\n\nShe smiled at him with half-closed eyes and the conviction that, with\nPleydon, she could easily be different. He leaned forward and his voice\nstartled her with the impression that he had read her mind:\n\n\"If you could care for any one a lifetime would be short to get you.\nLook, you have never been out of my thoughts--or within my reach. It\nseems a myth that I kissed you; impossible ... Linda.\"\n\n\"But you did,\" she told him, gaining happiness from the mere assurance.\nThey were alone in the drawing-room, and he rose, sweeping her up\ninto his arms. Yet the expected joy evaded her desire and the sudden\ndetermination to lose utterly her reserve. It was evident that he as\nwell was conscious of this, for he released her and stood frowning, his\nprotruding lower lip uglier than ever.\n\n\"A lifetime would be nothing,\" he said again; \"or it might be everything\nwasted. Which are you--all soul and spirit, or none?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she replied, in her bitter disappointment, her heart\npinched by the sharpest pain she remembered. There was the stir of\nskirts at the door; Linda turned with a sense of relief to Amelia\nLowrie. However, dinner progressed very well indeed. \"Then your aunt,\"\nElouise said to Pleydon, \"was Carrie Dodge. I recall her perfectly.\"\nThat established, the Lowrie women talked with a gracious freedom,\nexploring the furthermost infiltrations of blood and marriages.\n\nLinda was again serene. She watched Pleydon with an extraordinary\nformless conviction--each of them was a part of the other's life; while\nin some way marriage and love were now hopelessly confused. It was\nbeyond effort or planning. That was all she could grasp, but she was\ncontented. Sometimes when he talked he made the familiar descriptive\ngesture with his hand, as if he were shaping the form of his speech: a\nsculptor's gesture, Linda realized.\n\nLater they wandered into the garden, a dark enclosure with the long\nivy-covered fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the house broken by the lighted spaces of windows.\nBeyond the fence at regular intervals an electric car passed with\nan increasing and diminishing clangor. The white petals of the\nmagnolia-tree had fallen and been wheeled away; the blossoms of the\nrhododendron were dead on their stems. It was, Linda felt, a very old\ngarden that had known many momentary emotions and lives.\n\nDodge Pleydon, standing before her, put his hands on her shoulders.\n\"Would I have any success?\" he asked. \"Do you think you'd care for me?\"\n\nShe smiled confidently up at his intent face. \"Oh, yes.\" Yet she hoped\nthat he would not kiss her--just then. The delicacy of her longing and\nneed were far removed from material expressions. This, of course, meant\nmarriage; but marriage was money, comfort, the cold thing her mother had\nimpressed on her. Love, her love, was a mistake here. But in a little\nit would all come straight and she would understand. She no longer had\nconfidence in her mother's wisdom.\n\nIn spite of her shrinking, of a half articulate appeal, he crushed her\nagainst his face. Whatever that had filled her with hope, she thought,\nwas being torn from her. A sickening aversion over which she had no\ncontrol made her stark in his arms. The memories of the painted coarse\nsatiety of women and the sly hard men for which they schemed, the loose\ndiscussions of calculated advances and sordid surrenders, flooded her\nwith a loathing for what she passionately needed to be beautiful.\n\nYet deep within her, surprising in its vitality, a fragile ardor\npersisted. If she could explain, not only might he understand, but be\nable to make her own longing clear and secure. But all she managed\nto say was, \"If you kiss me again I think it will kill me.\" Even that\nfailed to stop him. \"You were never alive,\" he asserted. \"I'll put some\nfeeling into you. It has been done before with marble.\"\n\nLinda, unresponsive, suffered inordinately.\n\nAgain on her feet she saw that Pleydon was angry, his face grim. He\nseemed changed, threatening and unfamiliar; it was exactly as if, in\nplace of Dodge Pleydon, a secretive impersonal ugliness stood disclosed\nbefore her. He said harshly:\n\n\"When will you marry me?\"\n\nIt was what, above all else, she had wanted; and Linda realized that to\nmarry him was still the crown of whatever happiness she could imagine.\nBut her horror of the past recreated by his beating down of her\ngossamer-like aspiration, the vision of him flushed and ruthless, an\nimage of indiscriminate nameless man, made it impossible for her to\nreply. An abandon of shrinking fear numbed her heart and lips.\n\n\"You won't get rid of me as you do the others about you,\" he continued.\n\"This time you made a mistake. I haven't any pride that you can insult;\nbut I have all that you--with your character--require. I have more money\neven than you can want.\" She cried despairingly:\n\n\"It isn't that now! I had forgotten everything to do with money and\ndepended on you to take me away from it always.\"\n\n\"When will you marry me?\"\n\nIn a flash of blinding perception, leaving her as dazed as though it had\nbeen a physical actuality, she realized that marrying him had become an\nimpossibility. At the barest thought of it the dread again closed about\nher like ice. She tried, with all the force of old valuations, with even\nan effort to summon back the vanquished thrill, to give herself to\nhim. But a quality overpowering and instinctive, the response of her\nincalculable injury, made any contact with him hateful. It was\nutterly beyond her power to explain. A greater mystery still partly\nunfolded--whatever she had hoped from Pleydon belonged to the special\nemotion that had possessed her since earliest childhood.\n\nIn the immediate tragedy of her helplessness, with Dodge Pleydon\nimpatient for an assurance, she paused involuntarily to wonder about\nthat hidden imperative sense. There was a broken mental fantasy of--of a\nleopard bearing a woman in shining hair. This was succeeded by a bright\nthrust of happiness and, all about her, a surging like the imagined\nbeat of the wings of the Victory in Markue's room. Almost Pleydon had\nexplained everything, almost he was everything; and then the other,\nputting him aside, had swept her back into the misery of doubt and\nloneliness.\n\n\"I can't marry you,\" she said in a flat and dragged voice. He demanded\nabruptly:\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" She recognized his utter right to the temper that\nmastered him. For a moment Linda thought Pleydon would shake her. \"You\nfeel that way now,\" he declared; \"and perhaps next month; but you will\nchange; in the end I'll have you.\"\n\n\"No,\" she told him, with a certainty from a source outside her\nconsciousness. \"It has been spoiled.\"\n\nHe replied, \"Time will discover which of us is right. I'm almost willing\nto stay away till you send for me. But that would only make you more\nstubborn. What a strong little devil you are, Linda. I have no doubt I'd\ndo better to marry a human being. Then I think we both forget how young\nyou are--you can't pretend to be definite yet.\"\n\nHe captured her hands; too exhausted for any resentment or feeling she\nmade no effort to evade him. \"I'll never say good-bye to you.\"\n\nHis voice had the absolute quality of her own conviction. To her\namazement her cheeks were suddenly wet with tears. \"I want to go now,\"\nshe said unsteadily; \"and--and thank you.\"\n\nHis old easy formality returned as he made his departure. In reply to\nPleydon's demand she told him listlessly that she would be here for,\nperhaps, a week longer. Then he'd see her, he continued, in New York, at\nthe Feldts'.\n\nIn her room all emotion faded. Pleydon had said that she was still\nyoung; but she was sure she could never, in experience or feeling, be\nolder. She became sorry for herself; or rather for the illusions, the\nLinda, of a few hours ago. She examined her features in the limited\nuncertain mirror--strong sensations, she knew, were a charge on the\nappearance--but she was unable to find any difference in her regular\npallor. Then, mechanically conducting her careful preparations for the\nnight, her propitiation of the only omnipotence she knew, she put out\nthe candles of her May.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nWhat welcome Linda met in New York came from Mr. Moses Feldt, who\nembraced her warmly enough, but with an air slightly ill at ease. He\nbegged her to kiss her mama, who was sometimes hurt by Linda's coldness.\nShe made no reply, and found the same influence and evidence of the\npower of suggestion in Judith. \"We thought maybe you wouldn't care to\ncome back here,\" the latter said pointedly, over her shoulder, while\nshe was directing the packing of a trunk. The Feldts were preparing for\ntheir summer stay at the sea.\n\nHer mother's room resembled one of the sales of obvious and expensive\nattire conducted in the lower salons of pleasure hotels. There were\nairy piles of chiffon and satin, inappropriate hats and the inevitable\nconfections of silk and lace. \"It's not necessary to ask if you were\nright at home with your father's family,\" Mrs. Condon observed with an\nassumed casual inattention. \"I can see you sitting with those old women\nas dry and false as any. No one saved me in the clacking, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"We didn't speak of you,\" Linda replied. She studied, unsparing,\nthe loose flesh of the elder's ravaged countenance. Her mother, she\nrecognized, hated her, both because she was like Bartram Lowrie and\nstill young, with everything unspent that the other valued and had lost.\nIn support of herself Mrs. Feldt asserted again that she had \"lived,\"\nwith stacks of friends and flowers, lavish parties and devoted\nattendance.\n\n\"You may be smarter than I was,\" she went on, \"but what good it does\nyou who can say? And if you expect to get something for nothing you're\nfooled before you start.\" She shook out the airy breadths of a vivid\necho of past daring. \"From the way you act a person might think you\nwere pretty, but you are too thin and pulled out. I've heard your looks\ncalled peculiar, and that was, in a manner of speaking, polite. You're\nnot even stylish any more--the line is full again and not suitable for\nbony shoulders and no bust.\" She still cherished a complacency in her\namplitude.\n\nLinda turned away unmoved. Of all the world, she thought, only Dodge\nPleydon had the power actually to hurt her. She knew that she would\nsee him soon again and that again he would ask her to marry him. She\nconsidered, momentarily, the possibility of saying yes; and instantly\nthe dread born with him in the Lowrie garden swept over her. Linda told\nherself that he was the only man for whom she could ever deeply care;\nthat--for every conceivable reason--such a marriage was perfect. But the\nshrinking from its implications grew too painful for support.\n\nHer mother's bitterness increased hourly; she no longer hid her feelings\nfrom her husband and Judith; and dinner, accompanied by her elaborate\nsarcasm, was a difficult period in which, plainly, Mr. Moses Feldt\nsuffered most and Linda was the least concerned. This condition, she\nadmitted silently, couldn't go on indefinitely; it was too vulgar if for\nno other reason. And she determined to ask the Lowries for another and\nmore extended invitation.\n\nPleydon came, as she had expected, and they sat in the small\nreception-room with the high ceiling and dark velvet hangings, the piano\nat which, long ago it now seemed, Judith had played the airs of Gluck\nfor her. He said little, but remained for a long while spread over\nthe divan and watching her--in a formal chair--discontentedly. He rose\nsuddenly and stood above her, a domineering bulk obliterating nearly\neverything else. In response to his demand she said, pale and composed,\nthat she was not \"reasonable\"; she omitted the \"yet\" included in his\nquestion. Pleydon frowned. However, then, he insisted no further.\n\nWhen he had gone Linda was as spent as though there had been a fresh\nbrutal scene; and the following day she was enveloped in an unrelieved\ndepression. Her mother mocked her silence as another evidence of\nridiculous pretentiousness. Mr. Moses Feldt regarded her with a furtive\nconcerned kindliness; while Judith followed her with countless small\nirritating complaints. It was the last day at the apartment before their\ndeparture for the summer. Linda was insuperably tired. She had gone to\nher room almost directly after dinner, and when a maid came to her door\nwith a card, she exclaimed, before looking at it, that she was not in.\nIt was, however, Arnaud Hallet; and, with a surprise tempered by a faint\ninterest, she told the servant that she would see him.\n\nThere was, Linda observed at once, absolutely no difference in Arnaud's\nclothing, no effort to make himself presentable for New York or her. In\na way, it amused her--it was so characteristic of his forgetfulness, and\nit made him seem doubly familiar. He waved a hand toward the luxury of\nthe interior. \"This,\" he declared, \"is downright impressive, and lifted,\nI'm sure, out of a novel of Ouida's.\n\n\"You will remember,\" he continued, \"complaining about my sense of humor\none evening; and that, at the time, I warned you it might grow worse.\nIt has. I am afraid, where you are concerned, that it has absolutely\nvanished. My dear, you'll recognize this as a proposal. I thought my\nmind was made up, after forty, not to marry; and I specially tried not\nto bring you into it. You were too young, I felt. I doubted if I\ncould make you happy, and did everything possible, exhausted all the\narguments, but it was no good.\n\n\"Linda, dear, I adore you.\"\n\nShe was glad, without the slightest answering emotion, that Arnaud,\nwell--liked her. At the same time all her wisdom declared that she\ncouldn't marry him; and, with the unsparing frankness of youth and her\nindividual detachment, she told him exactly why.\n\n\"I need a great deal of money,\" she proceeded, \"because I am frightfully\nextravagant. All I have is expensive; I hate cheap things--even what\nsatisfies most rich girls. Why, just my satin slippers cost hundreds of\ndollars and I'll pay unlimited amounts for a little fulling of lace or\nsome rare flowers. You'd call it wicked, but I can't help it--it's me.\n\n\"I've always intended to marry a man with a hundred thousand dollars a\nyear. Of course, that's a lot--do you hate me for telling you?--but I\nwouldn't think of any one with less than fifty--\"\n\nArnaud Hallet interrupted quietly, \"I have that.\"\n\nLinda gazed incredulously at his neglected shoes, the wrinkles of his\ninconsiderable coat and unstudied scarf. She saw that, actually, he had\nspoken apologetically of his possessions; and a stinging shame spread\nthrough her at the possibility that she had seemed common to an\ninfinitely finer delicacy than hers.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nMost of these circumstances Linda Hallet quietly recalled sitting with\nher husband in the house that had been occupied by the Lowries'. A\nletter from Pleydon had taken her into a past seven years gone by; while\nordinarily her memory was indistinct; ordinarily she was fully occupied\nby the difficulties, or rather compromises, of the present. But, in the\ntranquil open glow of a Franklin stove and the withdrawn intentness of\nArnaud reading, her mind had returned to the distressed period of her\nwedding.\n\nElouise Lowrie--Amelia was dead--sunk in a stupor of extreme old age,\nher bloodless hands folded in an irreproachable black surah silk lap,\nsat beyond the stove; and Lowrie, Linda's elder child, five and a half,\ntogether with his sister Vign\u00c3\u00a9, had been long asleep above. Linda was\nprivately relieved by this: her children presented enormous obligations.\nThe boy, already at a model school, appalled her inadequate preparations\nby his flashes of perceptive intelligence; while she was frankly abashed\nat the delicate rosy perfection of her daughter.\n\nThe present letter was the third she had received from Dodge Pleydon,\nwhom she had not seen since her marriage. At first he had been enraged\nat the wrong, he had every reason to feel, she had done him. Then his\nanger had dissolved into a meager correspondence of outward and obvious\nfacts. There was so much that she had been unable to explain. He had\nalways been impatient, even contemptuous, of the emotion that made her\nsurrender to him unthinkable--Linda realized now that it had been the\nstrongest impulse of her life--and, of course, she had never accounted\nfor the practically unbalanced enmity of her mother.\n\nThe latter had deepened to an incredible degree, so much so that Mr.\nMoses Feldt, though he had never taken an actual part in it--such\nbitterness was entirely outside his generous sentimentality--had become\nacutely uncomfortable in his own home, imploring Linda, with ready\ntears, to be kinder to her mama. Judith, too, had grown cutting, jealous\nof Linda's serenity of youth, as her appearance showed the effect of her\nwasting emotions. Things quite extraordinary had happened: once\nLinda's skin had been almost seriously affected by an irritation that\nimmediately followed the trace of her powder-puff; and at several times\nshe had had clumsily composed anonymous notes of a most distressing\nnature.\n\nShe had wondered, calmly enough, which of the two bitter women were\nresponsible, and decided that it was her mother. At this the situation\nat the Feldts', increasingly strained, had become an impossibility.\nArnaud Hallet, after his first visit, had soon returned. There was no\nmore mention of his money; but every time he saw her he asked her\nagain, in his special manner--a formality flavored by a slight diffident\nhumor--to marry him. Arnaud's proposals had alternated with Pleydon's\nutterly different demand.\n\nLinda remembered agonized evenings when, in a return of his brutal\nmanner of the unforgettable night in the Lowrie garden, he tried to\nforce a recognition of his passion. It had left her cold, exhausted,\nthe victim of a mingled disappointment at her failure to respond with\na hatred of all essential existence. At last, on a particularly trying\noccasion, she had desperately agreed to marry him.\n\nThe aversion of her mother, becoming really dangerous, had finally\nappalled her; and a headache weighed on her with a leaden pain. Dodge,\ntoo, had been unusually considerate; he talked about the future--tied\nup, he asserted, in her--of his work; and suddenly, at the signal of her\nrare tears, Linda agreed to a wedding.\n\nIn the middle of the night she had wakened oppressed by a dread\nresulting in an uncontrollable chill. She thought first that her mother\nwas bending a malignant face over her; and then realized that her\nfeeling was caused by her promise to Dodge Pleydon. It had grown worse\ninstead of vanishing, waves of nameless shrinking swept over her; and in\nthe morning, further harrowed by the actualities of being, she had sent\na telegram to Arnaud Hallet--to Arnaud's kindness and affection, his\ndetachment not unlike her own.\n\nThey were married immediately; and through the ceremony and the\nsucceeding days she had been almost entirely absorbed in a sensation of\nescape. At the death of Amelia Lowrie, soon after, Arnaud had suggested\na temporary period in the house she remembered with pleasure; and,\nmaking small alterations with the months and years, they had tacitly\nagreed to remain.\n\nLinda often wondered, walking about the lower floor, why it seemed so\nfamiliar to her: she would stand in the dining-room, with its ceiling of\ndarkened beams, and gaze absent-minded through the long windows at the\nclose-cut walled greenery without. The formal drawing-room, at the right\nof the street entrance, equally held her--a cool interior with slatted\nwooden blinds, a white mantelpiece with delicately reeded supports and a\nbas-relief of Minerva on the center panel, a polished brass scuttle for\ncannel-coal and chairs with wide severely fretted backs upholstered in\nold pale damask.\n\nThe house seemed familiar, but she could never grow accustomed to the\nundeniable facts of her husband, the children and her completely changed\natmosphere. She admitted to herself that her principal feeling in\nconnection with Lowrie and Vign\u00c3\u00a9 was embarrassment. Here she always\ncondemned herself as an indifferent, perhaps unnatural, mother. She\ncouldn't help it. In the same sense she must be an unsatisfactory wife.\nLinda was unable to shake off the conviction that it was like a play in\nwhich she had no more than a spectator's part.\n\nThis was her old disability, the result of her habit of sitting, as\na child, apart from the concerns and stir of living. She made every\npossible effort to overcome it, to surrender to her new conditions; but,\nif nothing else, an instinctive shyness prevented. It went back further,\neven, she thought, than her own experience, and she recalled all she had\nheard and reconstructed of her father--a man shut in on himself who had,\none day, without a word walked out of the door and left his wife,\nnever to return. These realizations, however, did little to clarify her\nvision; she was continually trying to adjust her being to circumstances\nthat persistently remained a little distant and blurred.\n\nIn appearance, anyhow, Linda told herself with a measure of reassurance,\nshe was practically unchanged. She still, with the support of Arnaud,\ndisregarding current fashion, wore her hair in a straight bang across\nher brow and blue gaze. She was as slender as formerly, but more\ngracefully round, in spite of the faint characteristic stiffness that\nwas the result of her mental hesitation. Her clothes, too, had hardly\nvaried--she wore, whenever possible, white lawns ruffled about the\nthroat and hem, with broad soft black sashes, while her more formal\ndresses were sheaths of dull unornamented satin extravagant in the\nperfection of their simplicity.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nArnaud Hallet stirred, sharply closing his book. He had changed--except\nfor a palpable settling down of grayness--as little as Linda. For a\nwhile she had tried to bring about an improvement in his appearance, and\nhe had met her expressed wish whenever he remembered it; but this was\nnot often. In the morning a servant polished his shoes, brushed and\nironed his suits; yet by evening, somehow, he managed to look as though\nhe hadn't been attended to for days. She would have liked him to change\nfor dinner; other men of his connection did, it was a part of his\ninheritance. Arnaud, however, in his slight scoffing disparagement,\ndeclined individually to annoy himself. He was, she learned, enormously\nabsorbed in his historical studies and papers.\n\n\"Did you enjoy it?\" she asked politely of his reading. \"Extremely,\" he\nreplied. \"The American Impressions of Tyrone Power, the English actor,\nthrough eighteen thirty-three and four. His account of a European packet\nwith its handbells and Saratoga water and breakfast of spitch-cock\nis inimitable. I'd like to have sat at Cato's then, with a julep or\nhail-storm, and watched the trotting races.\"\n\nElouise Lowrie rose unsteadily, confused with dozing; but almost\nimmediately she gathered herself into a relentless propriety and a\nformal goodnight.\n\n\"What has been running through that mysterious mind of yours?\"\n\n\"I had a letter from Dodge,\" she told him simply; \"and I was thinking a\nlittle about the past.\" He exhibited the nice unstrained interest of\nhis admirable personality. \"Is he still in France?\" he queried. \"Pleydon\nshould be a strong man; I am sure we are both conscious of a little\ndisappointment in him.\" She said: \"I'll read you his letter, it's on the\ntable.\n\n\"'You will see, my dear Linda, that I have not moved from the Rue de\nPenthi\u00c3\u00a8vre, although I have given up the place at Etretat, and I am not\ngoing to renew the lease here. Rodin insists, and I coming to agree with\nhim, that I ought to be in America. But the serious attitude here toward\nart, how impossible that word has been made, is charming. And you will\nbe glad to know that I have had some success in the French good opinion.\nA marble, Cotton Mather, that I cut from the stone, has been bought for\nthe Luxembourg.\n\n\"'I can hear you both exclaim at the subject, but it is very\nrepresentative of me now. I am tired of mythological naiads in a\nconstant state of pursuit. Get Hallet to tell you something about\nMather. What a somber flame! I have a part Puritan ancestry, as any\nLowrie will inform you. Well, I shall be back in a few months, very\nserious, and a politician--a sculptor has to be that if he means to land\nany public monuments in America.\n\n\"'I hope to see you.'\"\n\nThe letter ended abruptly, with the signature, \"Pleydon.\"\n\n\"Are you happy, Linda?\" Arnaud Hallet asked unexpectedly after a short\nsilence. So abruptly interrogated she was unable to respond. \"What\nI mean is,\" he explained, \"do you think you would have been happier\nmarried to him? I knew, certainly, that it was the closest possible\nthing between us.\" Now, however, she was able to satisfy him:\n\n\"I couldn't marry Dodge.\"\n\n\"Is it possible to tell me why?\"\n\n\"He hurt me very much once. I tried to marry him, I tried to forget it,\nbut it was useless. I was dreadfully unhappy, in a great many ways--\"\n\n\"So you sent for me,\" he put in as she paused reflectively. \"I didn't\nhurt you, at any rate.\" It seemed to her that his tone was shadowed.\n\"You have never hurt me, Arnaud,\" she assured him, conscious of the\ninadequacy of her words. \"You were everything I wanted.\"\n\n\"Except for my hats,\" he said in a brief flash of his saving humor. \"It\nwould be better for me, perhaps, if I could hurt you. That ability\ncomes dangerously close to a constant of love. You mustn't think I\nam complaining. I haven't the slightest reason in the face of your\ndevastating honesty. I didn't distress you and I had the necessary\nminimum--the fifty thousand.\" His manner was so even, so devoid of\nsting, that she could smile at the expression of her material ambitions.\n\"I realize exactly your feeling for myself, but what puzzles me is your\nattitude toward the children.\"\n\n\"I don't understand it either,\" she admitted, \"except that I am quite\nafraid of them. They are so different from all my own childhood; often\nthey are too much for me. Then I dread the time when they will discover\nhow stupid and uneducated I am at bottom. I'm sure you already ask\nquestions before them to amuse yourself at my doubt. What shall I do,\nArnaud, when they are really at school and bring home their books?\"\n\n\"Retreat behind your dignity as a parent,\" he advised. \"They are certain\nto display their knowledge and ask you to bound things or name the\ncapital of Louisiana.\" She cried, \"Oh, but I know that, it's New\nOrleans!\" She saw at once, from his entertained expression, that she\nwas wrong again, and became conscious of a faint flush of annoyance. \"It\nwill be even worse,\" she continued, \"when Vign\u00c3\u00a9 looks to me for advice;\nI mean when she is older and has lovers.\"\n\n\"She won't seriously; they never do. She'll tell you when it's all over.\nLowrie will depend more on you. I may have my fun about the capital of\nLouisiana, Linda, but I have the greatest confidence in your wisdom. God\nknows what an unhappy experience your childhood was, but it has given\nyou a superb worldly balance.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're saying that I am cold,\" she told him. \"It must be\ntrue, because it is repeated by every one. Yet, at times, I used to be\nvery different--you'd never imagine what a romantic thrill or strange\nideas were inside of me. Like a memory of a deep woods, and--and the\nloveliest adventure. Often I would hear music as clearly as possible,\nand it made me want I don't know what terrifically.\"\n\n\"An early experience,\" he replied. Suddenly she saw that he was tired,\nhis face was lined and dejected. \"You read too much,\" Linda declared.\nHe said: \"But only out of the printed book.\" She wondered vainly what he\nmeant. As he stood before the glimmering coals, in the room saturated\nin repose, she wished that she might give him more; she wanted to\nspend herself in a riot of feeling on Arnaud and their children. What a\ndetestable character she had! Her desire, her efforts, were wasted.\n\nHe went about putting up the windows and closing the outside shutters, a\nconfirmed habit. Linda rose with her invariable sense of separation, the\nfeeling that, bound on a journey with a hidden destination, she was only\ntemporarily in a place of little importance. It was like being always in\nher hat and jacket. Arnaud shook down the grate; then he gazed over\nthe room; it was all, she was sure, as it had been a century ago, as it\nshould be--all except herself.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nYet her marriage had realized in almost every particular what she\nhad--so much younger--planned. The early suggestion, becoming through\nconstant reiteration a part of her knowledge, had been followed and\naccomplished; and, as well, her later needs were served. Linda told\nherself that, in a world where a very great deal was muddled, she had\nbeen unusually fortunate. And this made her angry at her pervading lack\nof interest in whatever she had obtained.\n\nOther women, she observed, obviously less fortunate than she, were\nvolubly and warmly absorbed in any number of engagements and pleasures;\nshe continually heard them, Arnaud's connections--the whole superior\nsociety, eternally and vigorously discussing servants and bridge, family\nand cotillions, indiscretions and charities. These seemed enough for\nthem; their lives were filled, satisfied, extraordinarily busy. Linda,\nfor the most part, had but little to do. Her servants, managed with\nremote exactness, gave no trouble; she had an excellent woman for the\nchildren; her dress presented no new points of anxiety nor departure ...\nshe was, in short, Arnaud admitted, perfectly efficient. She disposed of\nsuch details mechanically, almost impatiently, and was contemptuous, no\nenvious, of the women whose demands they contented.\n\nAt the dinners, the balls, to which Arnaud's sense of obligation both\nto family and her took them against his inclination, it was the\nsame--everyone, it appeared to Linda, was flushed with an intentness she\ncould not share. Men, she found, some of them extremely pleasant, still\nmade adroit and reassuring efforts for her favor; the air here, she\ndiscovered, was even freer than the bravado of her earlier surroundings.\nThis love-making didn't disturb her--it was, ultimately, the men who\nwere fretted--indeed, she had rather hoped that it would bring her the\nrelief she lacked.\n\nBut again the observations and speculation of her mature childhood, what\nshe had heard revealed in the most skillful feminine dissections, had\ncleared her understanding to a point that made the advances of hopeful\nmen quite entertainingly obvious. Their method was appallingly similar\nand monotonous. She liked, rather than not, the younger ones, whose\nconfidence that their passion was something new on earth at times\nrefreshed her; but the navigated materialism of greater experience\nfinally became distasteful. She discussed this sharply with Arnaud:\n\n\"You simply can't help believing that most women are complete idiots.\"\n\n\"You haven't said much more for men.\"\n\n\"The whole thing is too silly! Why is it, Arnaud? It ought to be\nimpressive and sweep you off your feet, up--\"\n\n\"Instead of merely behind some rented palms,\" he added. \"But I must say,\nLinda, that you are not a very highly qualified judge of sentiment.\"\nHe pronounced this equably, but she was conscious of the presence of an\ninjury in his voice. She was a little weary at being eternally condemned\nfor what she couldn't help. Any failure was as much Arnaud Hallet's as\nhers; he had had his opportunity, all that for which he had implored\nher. Her thoughts returned to Dodge Pleydon. April was well advanced,\nand he had written that he'd be back and see them in the spring. Linda\nlistened to her heart but it was unhastened by a beat. She would be very\nglad to have him at hand, in her life again, of course.\n\nThen the direction of her mind veered--what did he still think of her?\nProbably he had altogether recovered from his love for her. It had been\na warm day, and Arnaud had opened a window; but now she was aware of a\ncold air on her shoulder and she asked him abruptly to lower the sash.\nLinda remembered, with a lingering sense of triumph, the Susanna Noda\nwhom Dodge had left at a party for her. There had been a great many\nSusannas in his life; the reason for this was the absence of any\noverwhelming single influence. It might be that now--he had written of\nthe change in the subjects of his work--such a guide had come into his\nexistence. She hoped she had. Yet, in view of the announced silliness of\nwomen, she didn't want him to be cheaply deluded.\n\nHe was an extremely human man.\n\nBut she, Linda, it seemed, was an inhuman woman. The days ran into weeks\nthat added another month to spring; a June advanced sultry with heat;\nand, suddenly as usual, a maid at the door of her room announced\nPleydon. It was five o'clock in the afternoon, she had to dress, and she\nsent him a message that he mustn't expect her in a hurry. She paused in\nher deliberate preparations for a long thoughtful gaze into a mirror;\nthere was not yet a shadow on her face, the trace of a line at her eyes.\nThe sharp smooth turning and absolute whiteness of her bare shoulders\nwere flawless.\n\nAt first it appeared to Linda that he, too, had not changed. They were\nin the library opening into the dining-room, a space shut against the\nsun by the Venetian blinds, and faintly scented by a bowl of early tea\nroses. He appeared the same--large and informally clad in gray flannels,\nwith aggressive features and sensitive strong hands. He was quiet but\nplainly happy to be with her again and sat leaning forward on his knees,\nwatching her intently as she chose a seat.\n\nThen it slowly dawned on her that he had changed, yes--tragically.\nPleydon, in every way, was years older. His voice, less arbitrary,\nhad new depths of questioning, his mouth was more repressed, his face\nnotably sparer of flesh. He was immediately aware of the result of her\nscrutiny. \"I have been working like a fool,\" he explained. \"A breath of\nsickness, too, four years ago in Soochow. One of the damnable Asiatic\nfevers that a European is supposed to be immune from. You are a miracle,\nLinda. How long has it been--nearly eight years; you have two children\nand Arnaud Hallet and yet you are the girl I met at Markue's. I wanted\nto see you different, just a little, a trace of something that should\nhave happened to you. It hasn't. You're the most remarkable mother\nalive.\"\n\n\"If I am,\" she returned, \"it is not as a success, or at least for me.\nLowrie and Vign\u00c3\u00a9 are healthy, and happy enough; but I can't lose myself\nin them, Dodge; I can't lose myself at all.\"\n\nHe was quiet at this, the smoke of his cigarette climbing bluely in a\nspace with the aqueous stillness of a lake's depths. \"The same,\" he went\non after a long pause; \"nothing has touched you. I ought to be relieved\nbut, do you know, it frightens me. You are relentless. You have no\nright, at the same time, to be beautiful. I have seen a great many\ncelebrated women at their best moments, but you are lovelier than any.\nIt isn't a simple affair of proportion and features--I wish I could hold\nit in a phrase, the turn of a chisel. I can't. It's deathless romance in\na bang cut blackly across heavenly blue.\" He was silent again, and Linda\nglad that he still found her attractive. She discovered that the misery\nhis presence once caused her had entirely vanished, its place taken\nby an eager interest in his affairs, a lightness of spirit at the\nrealization that, while his love for her might have grown calm, no other\nwoman possessed it.\n\nAt the dinner-table she listened--cool and fresh, Arnaud complained,\nin spite of the heat--to the talk of the two men. By her side Elouise\nLowrie occasionally repeated, in a voice like the faint jangle of an old\nthin piano, the facts of a family connection or a commendation of the\nDodges. Arnaud really knew a surprising lot, and his conversation with\nPleydon was strung with terms completely unintelligible to her. It\ndeveloped, finally, into an argument over the treatment of the acanthus\nmotive in rococo ornament. France was summoned against Spain; the\narchitectural degrading of Italy deplored.... It amazed her that any one\ncould remember so much.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nLinda without a conscious reason suddenly stopped the investigation of\nher feeling for Pleydon. Even in the privacy of her thoughts an added\nobscurity kept her from the customary clear reasoning. After dinner,\nout in the close gloom of the garden, she watched the flicker of the\ncigarettes. There was thunder, so distant and vague that for a long\nwhile Linda thought she was deceived. She had a keen rushing sensation\nof the strangeness of her situation here--Linda Hallet. The night was\nlike a dream from which she would stir, sigh, to find herself back again\nin the past waiting for the return of her mother from one of her late\nparties.\n\nBut it was Arnaud who moved and, accompanying Elouise Lowrie, went into\nthe house for his interminable reading. Pleydon's voice began in a low\nremembering tone:\n\n\"What a fantastic place the Feldt apartment was, with that smothered\nroom where you said you would marry me. You must have got hold of Hallet\nin the devil of a hurry. I've often tried to understand what happened;\nwhy, all the time, you were upset--why, why, why?\"\n\n\"In a way it was because a ridiculous hairdresser burned out some of my\nmother's front wave,\" she explained.\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied derisively, \"nothing could be plainer.\"\n\nShe agreed calmly. \"It was very plain. If you want me to try to tell you\ndon't interrupt. It isn't a happy memory, and I am only doing it because\nI was so rotten to you.\n\n\"Yes, I can see now that it was the hairdresser and a hundred other\nthings exactly the same. My mother, all the women we knew, did nothing\nbut lace and paint and frizzle for men. I used to think it was a game\nthey played and wonder where the fun was. There were even hints about\nthat and later they particularized and it made me as sick as possible.\nThe men, too, were odious; mostly fat and bald; and after a while, when\nthey pinched or kissed me, I wanted to die.\n\n\"That was all I knew about love, I had never heard of any other--men\naway from their families for what they called a good time and women\nplotting and planning to give it to them or not give it to them. Then\nmother, after her looks were spoiled, married Mr. Moses Feldt, and I\nmet Judith, who only existed for men and men's rooms and told me worse\nthings, I'm sure, than mother ever dreamed; and, on top of that, I met\nyou and you kissed me.\n\n\"But it was different from any other; it didn't shock me, and it brought\nback a thrill I have always had. I wanted, then, to love you, and have\nyou ask me to marry you, more than anything else in the world. I was\nsure, if you would only be patient, that I could change what had hurt\nme into a beautiful feeling. I couldn't tell you because I didn't\nunderstand myself.\" She stopped, and Pleydon repeated, bitterly and\nslow:\n\n\"Fat old bald men; and I was one with them destroying your exquisite\nhope.\" She heard the creak of the basket chair as he leaned forward, his\nface masked in darkness. \"Perhaps you think I haven't paid.\n\n\"You will never know what love is unless I can manage somehow to make\nyou understand how much I love you. Hallet will have to endure your\nhearing it. This doesn't belong to him; it has not touched the earth.\nEvery one, more or less, talks about love; but not one in a thousand,\nnot one in a million, has such an experience. If they did it would tear\nthe world into shreds. It would tear them as it has me. I realize the\nother, the common thing--who experimented more! This has nothing to do\nwith it. A boy lost in the idealism of his first worship has a faint\nreflection. Listen:\n\n\"I can always, with a wish, see you standing before me. You\nyourself--the folds of your sash, the sharp narrow print of your\nslippers on the pavement or the matting or the rug, the ruffles about\nyour hands. I have the feeling of you near me with your breathing\ndisturbing the delicacy of your breast. There is the odor and shimmer of\nyour hair ... your lips move ... but without a sound.\n\n\"This vision is more real than reality, than an opera-house full of\npeople or the Place Vend\u00c3\u00b4me; and it, you, is all I care for, all I think\nabout, all I want. I find quiet places and stay there for hours, with\nyou; or, if that isn't possible, I turn into a blind man, a dead man\nwarm again at the bare thought of your face. Listen:\n\n\"I've been in shining heaven with you. I have been melted to nothing and\nmade over again, in you, good. We have been walking together in a new\nworld with rapture instead of air to breathe. A slow walk through dark\ntrees--God knows why--like pines. And every time I think of you it is\nexactly as though I could never die, as though you had burned all the\ncorruption out of me and I was made of silver fire. And listen:\n\n\"Nothing else is of any importance, now or afterward, you are now and\nthe hereafter. I see people and people and hear words and words, and I\nforget them the moment they have gone, the second they are still. But I\nhaven't lost an inflection of your voice. When I work in clay or stone I\nmodel and cut you into every surface and fold. I see you looking back at\nme out of marble and bronze. And here, in this garden, you tried to give\nme more--\"\n\nThe infinitely removed thunder was like the continued echo of his voice.\nThere was a stirring of the leaves above her head; and the light that\nhad shone against the house in Elouise Lowrie's window was suddenly\nextinguished. All that she felt was weariness and a confused dejection,\nthe weight of an insuperable disappointment. She could say nothing.\nWords, even Pleydon's, seemed to her vain. The solid fact of Arnaud, of\nwhat Dodge, more than seven years before, had robbed her, put everything\nelse aside, crushed it.\n\nShe realized that she would never get from life what supremely\nrepaid the suffering of other women, made up for them the failure of\npractically every vision. She was sorry for herself, yes, and for Dodge\nPleydon. Yet he had his figures in metal and stone; his sense of the\nimportance of his work had increased enormously; and, well, there were\nLowrie and Vign\u00c3\u00a9; it would be difficult, every one agreed, to find\nbetter or handsomer children. But they seemed no more than shadows or\ncolored mist. This terrified her--what a hopelessly deficient woman she\nmust be! But even in the profundity of her depression the old vibration\nof nameless joy reached her heart.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nIn the morning there was a telegram from Judith Feldt, saying that her\nmother was dangerously sick, and she had lunch on the train for New\nYork. The apartment seemed stuffy; there was a trace of dinginess,\nneglect, about the black velvet rugs and hangings. Her mother, she\nfound, had pneumonia; there was practically no chance of her recovering.\nLinda sat for a short while by the elder's bed, intent upon a totally\nstrange woman, darkly flushed and ravished in an agonizing difficulty of\nbreathing. Linda had a remembered vision of her gold-haired and gay\nin floating chiffons, and suddenly life seemed shockingly brief. A\nserious-visaged clergyman entered the room as she left and she heard the\nrich soothing murmur of a confident phrase.\n\nThe Stella Condon who had become Mrs. Moses Feldt had had little time\nfor the support of the church; although Linda recalled that she had\nuniformly spoken well of its offices. To condemn Christianity, she had\nasserted, was to invite bad luck. She treated this in exactly the way\nshe regarded walking under ladders or spilling salt or putting on a\nstocking wrong. Linda, however, had disregarded these possibilities of\ndisaster and, with them, religion.\n\nA great many people, she noticed, talked at length about it; women in\ntheir best wraps and with expensive little prayer books left the hotels\nfor various Sunday morning services, and ministers came in later for\ntea. All this, she understood, was in preparation for heaven, where\neverybody, who was not in hell, was to be forever the same and yet\nradiantly different. It seemed very vague and far away to Linda, and,\nsince there was such a number of immediate problems for her to consider,\nshe had easily ignored the future. When now, with her mother dying, it\nwas thrust most uncomfortably before her.\n\nShe half remembered sentences, admonitions, of the godly--a woman had\nonce told her that dancing and low gowns were hateful in the sight of\nGod, some one else that playing-cards were an instrument of the devil.\nPleasure, she had gathered, was considered wrong, and she instinctively\nput these opinions, together with a great deal else, aside as envious.\n\nThat expressed her whole experience. She had never keenly associated the\nthought of death with herself before, and she was unutterably revolted\nby the impending destruction of her fine body, the delicate care\nof which formed her main preoccupation in life. Age was supremely\ndistasteful, but this other ... she shuddered.\n\nLinda wanted desperately to preserve the whiteness of her skin, the\nflexible black distinction of her hair, yes--her beauty. Here, again,\nwith other women the vicarious immortality of children would be\nsufficient. But not for her. She was in the room that had been hers\nbefore marriage, with her infinite preparations for the night at an\nend; and, her hair loose across the blanched severity of her attire,\nher delicately full arms bare, she clasped her cold hands in stabbing\napprehension.\n\nShe would do anything, anything, to escape that repulsive fatality to\nher lavished care. It was only to be accomplished by being good; and\ngoodness was in the charge of the minister. She saw clearly and at once\nher difficulty--how could she go to a solemn man in a clerical vest and\nadmit that she was solely concerned by the impending loss of her beauty.\nThe promised splendor of heaven, in itself, failed to move her--it\nthreatened to be monotonous; and she was honest in her recognition that\ncharity, the ugliness of poverty, repelled her. Linda was certain that\nshe could never change in these particulars; she could only pretend.\n\nA surprising multiplication of such pretense occurred to her in people\nregarded as impressively religious. She had seen men like that--she\nvaguely thought of the name Jasper--going off with her mother in cabs\nto dinners that must have been \"godless.\" She wondered if this mere\nattitude, the public show, were enough. And an instinctive response told\nher that it was not. If all she had been informed about the future were\ntrue she decided that her mother's chance was no worse than that of any\nfalse display of virtue.\n\nShe, Linda, could do nothing.\n\nThe funeral ceremony with its set form--so inappropriate to her mother's\nqualities--was even more remote from Linda's sympathies than was common\nin her encounters. But Mr. Moses Feldt's grief appeared to her actual\nand affecting. He invested every one with the purity of his own spirit.\n\nShe left New York at the first possible moment with the feeling that she\nwas definitely older. The realization, she discovered, happened in\nthat way--ordinarily giving the flight of time no consideration it was\nbrought back to her at intervals of varying length. As she aged they\nwould grow shorter.\n\nThe result of this experience was an added sense of failure; she tried\nmore than ever to overcome her indifference, get a greater happiness\nfrom her surroundings and activity. Linda cultivated an attention to\nLowrie and Vign\u00c3\u00a9. They responded charmingly but her shyness with them\npersisted in the face of her inalienable right to their full possession.\nShe insisted, too, on going about vigorously in spite of Arnaud's\nhumorous groans and protests. She forced herself to talk more to the\nmen attracted to her, and assumed, with disconcerting ease, an air of\nsympathetic interest. But, unfortunately, this brought on her a rapid\nincrease of the love-making that she found so fatiguing.\n\nShe studied her husband thoughtfully through the evenings at home,\nbefore the Franklin stove, or, in summer, in the secluded garden.\nAbsolutely nothing was wrong with him; he had, after several deaths,\ninherited even more money; and, in his deprecating manner where it was\nconcerned, devoted it to her wishes. Except for books, and the clothes\nshe was forced to remind him to get, he had no personal expenses. In\naddition to the money he never offended her, his relationships and\nmanner were conducted with an inborn nice formality that preserved her\nhighest self-opinion.\n\nYet she was never able to escape from the limitations of a calm\nadmiration; she couldn't lose herself, disregard herself in a flood of\ngenerous emotion. When, desperately, she tried, he, too, was perceptibly\nill at ease. Usually he was undisturbed, but once, when she stood beside\nhim with her coffee cup at dinner, he disastrously lost his equanimity.\nTensely putting the cup away he caught her with straining hands.\n\n\"Oh, Linda,\" he cried, \"is it true that you love me! Do you really\nbelong to us--to Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and Lowrie and me? I can't stand it if you won't\n... some day.\"\n\nShe backed away into the opening of a window, against the night, from\nthe justice of his desire; and she was cold with self-detestation as her\nfingers touched the glass. Linda tried to speak, to lie; but, miserably\nstill, she was unable to deceive him. The animation, the fervor of his\nlonging, swiftly perished. His arms dropped to his side. An unbearable\nconstraint deepened with the silence in the room, and later he lightly\nsaid:\n\n\"You mustn't trifle with my ancient heart, Linda, folly and age--\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nThe only other quantity in her life was Dodge Pleydon. He wrote her\nagain, perhaps three months after the explanation of his love; but his\nletter was devoted wholly to his work, and so technical that she had to\nask Arnaud to interpret it. He added:\n\n\"That is the mind of an impressive man. He has developed\nenormously--curious, so late in life. Pleydon must be fully as old as\nmyself. It's clear that he has dropped his women. I saw a photograph\nof the Cotton Mather reproduced in a weekly, and it was as gaunt as a\nPuritan Sunday. Brimmed with power. Why don't we see him oftener? Write\nand say I'd like to contradict him again about the Eastlake period.\"\n\nHe made no further reference to Pleydon then, and Linda failed to write\nas Arnaud suggested. Though she wasn't disturbed at the possibility of\na continuation of his admissions of love she was weary of the thought of\nits uselessness. Linda was, she told herself, damned by practicability.\nHer husband used the familiar term of reproach, material. She didn't\nin the least want to be. Circumstance, she had a feeling, had forced it\nupon her.\n\nArnaud, however, who had met Dodge Pleydon in Philadelphia, brought him\nhome. Linda saw with a strange constriction of the heart that Pleydon's\nhair was definitely gray. He had had a recurrence of the fever\ncontracted in Soochow. The men at once entered on another discussion\nwhich she was unable to follow; but it was clear that her husband\nnow listened with an increasing surrender of opinion to the sculptor.\nPleydon, it was true, was correspondingly more impatient with minds that\ndisagreed with his. He was at once thinner and bigger, his face deeply\nlined; but his eyes had a steady vital intensity difficult to encounter.\n\nShe considered him in detail as the talk left dinner, the glasses and\ncandles spent. He drank, from a tall tumbler with a single piece of\nice, the special whisky Arnaud kept. He had been neglecting himself,\ntoo--there were traces of clay about his finger-nails, and he ate\nhurriedly and insufficiently. When she had an opportunity, Linda\ndecided, she would speak to him about these necessary trifles. Then, she\nhad no chance; and it was not until the following winter, at a Thursday\nafternoon concert during the yearly exhibition of the Academy of Fine\nArts, that she could gently complain.\n\nIt was gloomy, with a promise of snow outside; and the great space of\nthe stairway to the galleries was filled with shadow and the strains\nof _Armide_ echoing from the orchestra playing at the railing above\nthe entrance. Pleydon, together with a great many others, had spread\nan overcoat on the masonry of the steps, and they were seated in the\nobscurity of the balustrade.\n\n\"You look as though you hadn't had enough to eat,\" she observed. \"You\nused to be almost thick but now you are a thing of terrifying grimness.\nYou look like a monk. I wonder why you're like a monk, Dodge?\"\n\n\"Linda Condon,\" he replied.\n\n\"That can't be it now; I haven't been Linda Condon for years, but Mrs.\nArnaud Hallet. It's very pretty, of course, and I'd like to think\nyou could keep a young love alive so long. Experience makes me doubt\nanything of the sort; but then I was always skeptical.\"\n\n\"You have never been anyone else,\" he asserted positively. \"You were\nborn Linda Condon and you'll die that, except for some extraordinary\naccident. I can't imagine what it would be--a miracle like quaker-ladies\nin the Antarctic.\"\n\n\"It sounds uncomplimentary, and I'm sick of being compared with polar\nplaces. What are quaker-ladies?\"\n\n\"Fragile little flowers in the spring meadows.\"\n\n\"I'd rather listen to the music than you.\"\n\n\"That is why loving you is so eternal, why it doesn't fluctuate like a\nhuman emotion. You can't exhaust it and rest before a new tide sweeps\nback; the timeless ecstasy of a worship of God ... breeding madness.\"\n\nShe failed to understand and turned a troubled gaze to his bitter\nrepression. \"I don't like to make you unhappy, Dodge,\" she said in a low\ntone. \"What can I do? I am a horrid disappointment to all of you, but\nmost to myself. I can't go over it again.\"\n\n\"Beauty has nothing to do with happiness,\" he declared harshly. He rose,\nwithout consulting her wishes; and Linda followed him as he proceeded\nabove, irresistibly drawn to the bronze he was showing in the Rotunda.\n\nIt was the head and part of the shoulders of a very old woman,\ninfinitely worn, starved by want and spent in brutal labor. There was a\nthin wisp of hair pinned in a meager knot on her skull; her bones were\nmercilessly indicated, barely covered with drum-like skin; her mouth\nwas stamped with timid humility; while her eyes peered weakly from their\nsunken depths.\n\n\"Well?\" he demanded, interrogating her in the interest of his work.\n\n\"I--I suppose it's perfectly done,\" she replied, at a loss for a\nsatisfactory appreciation. \"It's true, certainly. But isn't it more\nunpleasant than necessary?\" Pleydon smiled patiently. \"Beauty,\" he said,\nwith his mobile gesture. \"Pity, _Katharsis_--the wringing out of all\ndross.\"\n\nThe helpless feeling of her overwhelming ignorance returned. She was\nlike a woman held beyond the closed door of treasure. \"Come over here.\"\nHe unceremoniously led her to the modeling of a ruffled grouse, faithful\nin every diversified feather. Linda thought it admirable, really\namazing; but he dismissed it with a passionate energy. \"The dull\nfiguriste!\" he exclaimed. \"Daguerre. Once I could have done that, yes,\nand been entertained by its adroitness and insolence--before you made\nme. Do you suppose I was able then to understand the sheer\ntragic fortitude to live of a scrubwoman! The head you thought\nunpleasant--haven't you seen her going home in the March slush of a\ncity? Did you notice the gaps in her shoes, the ragged shawl about a\nbody twisted with forty, fifty, sixty years of wet stone floors and\nsteps? Did you wonder what she had for supper?\"\n\n\"No, Dodge, I didn't. They always make me wretched.\"\n\n\"Well, to realize all that, to feel the degradation of her nature,\nto lie, sick with exhaustion, on the broken slats of her bed under a\nravelled-out travesty of a quilt, and get up morning after morning in\nan iron winter dark--to experience that in your spirit and put it into\ndurable metal, hard stone--is to hold beauty in your hands.\"\n\nHer interest in his speech was mingled with the knowledge that, in order\nto dress comfortably for dinner, she must leave immediately. Pleydon\nhelped her into the Hallet open motor landaulet. Linda demanded\nquantities of air. He was, he told her at the door, leaving in an hour\nfor New York. \"I wish you could be happier,\" she insisted. He reminded\nher that he had had the afternoon with her. It was so little, she\nthought, carried rapidly over a smooth wide street. His love for her\nincreased rather than lessened. How wonderful it was.... The woman\noutside that barred door of treasure.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nLinda thought frequently about Dodge and his feeling for her; memories\nof his words, his appearance, speculations, spread through her tranquil\ndaily affairs like the rich subdued pattern of a fine carpet on the\nbare floor of her life. She was puzzled by the depth of a passion that,\napparently, made no demands other than the occasional necessity to be\nwith her and the knowledge that she existed. If she had been a very\nintelligent woman, and, of course, not quite bad-looking, she might\nhave understood both Pleydon and Arnaud, the latter a man whose mind was\npractically absorbed in the pages of books. There could be no doubt, no\nquestion, of their love for her.\n\nThen there had always been the others--the men at the parties, in her\ngarden, through the old days of her childhood in hotels. It was very\nstupid, very annoying, but at the same time she became interested\nin what, with her candid indifference, affected them. She had never,\nreally, even when she desired, succeeded in giving them anything,\nanything conscious or for which they moved. Judith Feldt, on the\ncontrary, had been prodigal. And, while certainly numbers of men had\nbeen attracted to her, they all tired of her with marked rapidity. Men\nmet Judith, Linda recalled, with eagerness, they came immediately and\noften to see her ... for, perhaps, a month. Then, temporarily deserted,\nshe was submerged in depression and nervous tears.\n\nBut, while it was obviously impossible for all lovers to be constant,\ntwo extraordinary and superior men would be faithful to her as long as\nshe lived, no--as long as they lived. This was beyond doubt. One was\ncelebrated--she watched with a quiet pride Pleydon's fame penetrate\nthe country--and the other, her husband, a person of the most exacting\ndelicacy of habits, intellect and wit.\n\nWhat was it, she wondered, that made the supreme importance of women to\nmen worth consideration. Linda was thinking of this now in connection\nwith her daughter. Vign\u00c3\u00a9 was fourteen; a larger girl than she had ever\nbeen, with her father's fine abundant cinnamon-brown hair, a shapely\nsensitive mouth, and a wide brown gaze with a habit of straying, at\ninappropriate moments, from things seen to the invisible. She was, Linda\nrealized thankfully, transparently honest; her only affectation was\nthe slight supercilious manner of her associations; and she read,\nridiculously like her father, with increasing pleasure.\n\nHowever, what engaged Linda most was the fact that Vign\u00c3\u00a9 already liked\nmen; she had been at the fringe, as it were, of young dances, with a\nsparkling satisfaction to herself and the securely nice youths who \"cut\nin\" at her brief appearances.\n\nThe truth was that Linda saw that more than a trace of Stella Condon's\nwarm generosity of emotion had been brought by herself to Arnaud's\ndaughter. The faults of every life, every circumstance, were endlessly\nmultiplied through all existence. At fourteen, it was Linda's frowning\nimpression, her mother had very fully instructed her in the wiles and\nstructure of admirable marriage, and she had never completely lost some\nhard pearls of the elder's wisdom. Should she, in turn, communicate them\nto Vign\u00c3\u00a9?\n\nThe moment, the anxiety, she dreaded was arriving, and it found her no\nfreer of doubt than had the other aspects of her own responses. Yet\nhere she was possessed by the keenest need for absolute rectitude; and\nperhaps this, she thought, with an unusual pleasure, was an evidence of\nthe affection she had seemed to lack. But in the end she said nothing.\n\nShe was still unable to disentangle the flesh from the spirit, love--the\nlove that so amazingly illuminated Dodge Pleydon--from comfort. Dodge\nhad disturbed all her sense of values, even to the point of unsettling\nher allegiance to the supremacy of a great deal of money. He had worked\nthis without giving her anything definite, that she could explain to\nVign\u00c3\u00a9, in return. Linda preserved her demand for the actual. If she\ncould only comprehend the force animating Dodge she felt life would be\nclear.\n\nShe was tempted to experiment--when had such a possibility occurred to\nher before?--and discover just how far in several directions Pleydon's\ndevotion went. This would be easy now, she was unrestrained by the fact\nof Arnaud, and the old shrinking from the sculptor happily vanished. Yet\nwith him before her, on one of his infrequent visits to their house,\nshe realized that her courage was insufficient. Was it that or something\ndeeper--a reluctance to turn herself like a knife in the source of the\nprofoundest compliment a woman could be paid. Linda thought too\nhighly of his love for that; the texture of the carpet had become too\ngratifying.\n\nThey were all three in the library, as customary; and Linda, restless,\nsaw her reflection in a closed long window. She was wearing yellow, the\ncolor of the jonquils on a candle-stand; but with her familiar sash tied\nand the ends falling to the hem of her skirt. The pointed oval of her\nface was unchanged, her pallor, the straight line of her black bang, the\nblueness of her eyes, were as they had been a surprisingly long while\nago. Arnaud, with a disconcerting comprehension, demanded, \"Well, are\nyou satisfied?\" She replied coolly, \"Entirely.\" Pleydon, seated for\nover an hour without moving, or even the trivial relief of a cigarette,\nfollowed her with his luminous uncomfortable gaze, his disembodied\npassion.\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nLinda heard Vign\u00c3\u00a9's laugh, the expression of a sheer lightness of heart,\nfollowing a low eager murmur of voices in her daughter's room, and she\nwas startled by its resemblance to the gay pitch of Mrs. Moses Feldt's\nold merriment. Three of Vign\u00c3\u00a9's friends were with her, all approximately\neighteen, talking, Linda knew, men and--it was autumn--anticipating the\nexcitements of their bow to formal society that winter. They had, she\nsilently added, little enough to learn about the latter. Through the\nyear past they had been to a dancing-class identical, except for an\nearlier hour and age, with mature affairs; but before that they had been\npractically introduced to the pleasures of their inheritance.\n\nThe men were really boys at the university, past the first year,\nreceptacles of unlimited worldly knowledge and experience. They belonged\nto exclusive university societies and eating clubs, and Linda found\ntheir stiff similarity of correct bigoted pattern highly entertaining.\nShe had no illusions about what might be called their morals; they were\nmidway in the period of youthful unrestraint; but she recognized as well\nthat their attitude toward, for example, Vign\u00c3\u00a9 was irreproachable. Such\nboys affected to disdain the girls of their associated families ... or\nimagined themselves incurably in love.\n\nThe girls, for their part, while insisting that forty was the ideal age\nfor a lover--the terms changed with the seasons, last year \"suitor\" had\nbeen the common phrase--were occasionally swept in young company into a\nhigh irrational passion. Mostly, through skillful adult pressure or firm\nnegation, such affairs came to nothing; but even these were sometimes\novercome. And, when Linda had been disturbed by the echo of old days in\nher daughter's tones, she was considering exactly such a state.\n\nOne of the nicest youths imaginable, Bailey Sandby, had lost all trace\nof superior aloofness in a devotion to Vign\u00c3\u00a9. He was short, squarely\nbuilt, with clear pink cheeks, steady light blue eyes and crisp very\nfair hair. This was his last season of academic instruction, after\nwhich a number of years, at an absurdly low payment, awaited him in\nhis father's bond brokerage concern. However, he was, Linda gathered,\nimperious in his urgent need for Vign\u00c3\u00a9's favor.\n\nRidiculous, she thought, at the same time illogically rehearsing the\nresemblances of Vign\u00c3\u00a9 to her grandmother. She had no doubt that the\nparties Vign\u00c3\u00a9 shared on the terraces and wide lawns, in the informal\ndancing at country houses, were sufficiently sophisticated; there was\non occasion champagne, and--for the masculine element anyhow--cocktails.\nThe aroma of wine, lightly clinging to her young daughter's breath,\nfilled her with an old instinctive sickness.\n\nShe had spoken to Arnaud who, in turn, severely addressed Vign\u00c3\u00a9;\nbut during this Linda had been oppressed by the familiar feeling of\nimpotence. The girl, of course, had properly heard them; but she gave\nher mother the effect of slipping easily beyond their grasp. When she\nhad gone to bed Arnaud repeated a story brought to him by the juvenile\nLowrie, under the influence of a temporary indignation at his sister's\nunwarranted imposition of superiority. Arnaud went on:\n\n\"Actually they had this kissing contest, it was at Chestnut Hill, with\na watch held; and Vign\u00c3\u00a9, or so Lowrie insisted, won the prize for length\nof time--something like a minute. Now, when I was young--\"\n\nSubmerged in apprehensive memory Linda lost most of his account of\nthe Eden-like youth of his earlier day. When, at last, his assertions\npierced her abstraction, it was only to bring her to the realization of\nhow pathetically little he knew of either Vign\u00c3\u00a9 or her. She weighed\nthe question of utter frankness here--the quality enhanced by universal\nobscurity--but she was obliged to check her desire for perfect\nunderstanding. A purely feminine need to hide, even from Arnaud, any\ndetracting facts about women shut her into a diplomatic silence. In\nreality he could offer them no help; their problems--in a world\ncreated more objectively by the hand of man than God--were singular to\nthemselves. Women were quite like spoiled captives to foreign princes,\nmasking, in their apparent complacency, a necessarily secret but\ninsidiously tyrannical control. It wouldn't do, in view of this, to\nexpose too much.\n\nThe following morning it was Arnaud, rather than herself, who had a\nletter from Pleydon. \"He wants us to come over to New York and his\nstudio,\" the former explained. \"He has some commission or other from a\ncity in the Middle West, and a study to show us. I'd like it very\nmuch; we haven't seen this place, and his surroundings are not to be\noverlooked.\"\n\nPleydon's rooms were directly off Central Park West, in an apartment\nhouse obviously designed for prosperous creative arts, with a hall\nfrescoed in the tones of Puvis de Chavannes and an elevator cage\nbeautifully patterned in iron grilling. Dodge Pleydon met them in his\nnarrow entry and conducted them into a pleasant reception-room. \"It's a\nduplex,\" he explained of his quarters; \"the dining-room you see and the\nkitchen's beyond, while the baths and all that are over our heads; the\nstudio fills both floors.\"\n\nThere were low book cases with their continuous top used as a shelf for\na hundred various objects, deep long chairs of caressing ease and chairs\nof coffee-colored wicker with amazingly high backs woven with designs of\npolished shells into the semblance of spread peacocks' tails. The yellow\nsilk curtains at the windows, the rug with the intricate coloring of a\ncashmere shawl, the Russian tea service, were in a perfection of order;\nand Linda almost resentfully acknowledged the skilful efficiency of his\nmaid. It was surprising that, without a wife, a man could manage such a\ndegree of comfort!\n\nOver tea far better than hers, in china of an infinitely finer\nfragility, she studied Pleydon thoughtfully. He looked still again\nperceptibly older, his face continued to grow sparer of flesh,\nemphasizing the aggressively bony structure of his head. When he shut\nhis mouth after a decided statement she could see the projection of the\njaw and the knotted sinews at the base of his cheeks. No, Dodge didn't\nseem well. She asked if there had been any return of the fever and he\nnodded in an impatient affirmative, returning at once to the temporarily\nsuspended conversation with Arnaud. There was a vast difference, too, in\nthe way in which he talked.\n\nHis attitude was as assertive as ever, but it had less expression in\nwords; unaccountable periods of silence, almost ill-natured, overtook\nhim, spaces of abstraction when it was plain that he had forgotten the\npresence of whoever might be by. Even direct questions sometimes failed\nto pierce immediately his consciousness. Dodge, Linda told herself,\nlived entirely too much alone. Then she said this aloud, thoughtlessly,\nand she was startled by the sudden intolerable flash of his gaze.\nAn awkward pause followed, broken by the uprearing of Pleydon's\nconsiderable length.\n\n\"I must take you into the studio before it is too dark,\" he proceeded.\n\"Every creative spirit knows when its great moment has come. Well, mine\nis here.\" The men stood aside as Linda, her head positively ringing with\nthe thrill that was like a strain of Gluck, the happy sadness, entered\nthe bare high spaciousness of Dodge Pleydon's workroom.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\nEverything she saw, the stripped floor, the white walls bare but for\nsome casts like the dismembered fragments of flawless blanched bodies,\nthe inclined plane of the wide skylight, bore an impalpable white dust\nof dried clay. In a corner, enclosed in low boards, a stooped individual\nwith wood-soled shoes and a shovel was working a mass of clay over which\nat intervals he sprinkled water, and at intervals halted to make pliable\nlumps of a uniform size which he added to a pile wrapped in damp cloths.\nThere were a number of modeling stands with twisted wires grotesquely\nresembling a child's line drawing of a human being; while a stand with\nsome modeling tools on its edge bore an upright figure shapeless in its\nswathing of dampened cloths.\n\n\"The great moment,\" Pleydon said again, in a vibrant tone. \"But you know\nnothing of all this,\" he directly addressed Linda. \"Neither, probably,\nwill you have heard of Simon Downige. He was born at Cottarsport, in\nMassachusetts, about eighteen forty; and, after--in the support of his\nhatred of any slavery--he fought through the Civil War, he came home\nand found that his town stifled him. He didn't marry at once, as so many\nreturning soldiers did; instead he was wedded to a vision of freedom,\nfreedom of opinion, of spirit, worship--any kind of spaciousness\nwhatever. And, in the pursuit of that, he went West.\n\n\"He told them that he was going to find--but found was the word--a place\nwhere men could live together in a purity of motives and air. No more,\nyou understand; he hadn't a personal fanatical belief to exploit\nand attract the hysteria of women and insufficient men. He was not a\npathological messiah; but only Simon Downige, an individual who couldn't\ncomfortably breathe the lies and injustice and hypocrisy of the ordinary\ncommunity. No doubt he was unbalanced--his sensitiveness to a universal\ncondition would prove that. Normally people remain undisturbed by such\ntrivialities. If they didn't an end would come to one or the other, the\nlies or the world.\n\n\"He traveled part way in a Conestoga wagon--a flight out of Egypt; they\nwere common then, slow canvas-covered processions with entire families\ndrawn by the mysterious magnetism of the West. Then, leaving even such\nwayfarers, he walked, alone, until he came on a meadow by a little river\nand a grove of trees, probably cottonwoods.... That was Simon Downige,\nand that, too, was Hesperia. Yes, he was unbalanced--the old Greek\nname for beautiful lands. It is a city now, successful and corruptly\nadministered--what always happens to such visions.\n\n\"It is necessary, Linda, as I've always told you, to understand the\nwhole motive behind a creation in permanent form. A son of Simon's--yes,\nhe finally married--a unique and very rich character, wife dead and no\nchildren, commissioned a monument to the founder of Hesperia, in Ohio,\nand of his fortune.\n\n\"They even have a civic body for the control of public building; and\nthey came East to approve my statue, or rather the clay sketch for it.\nThey were very solemn, and one, himself a sculptor, a graduate of the\nBeaux Arts, ran a suggestive thumb over Simon and did incredible damage.\nBut, after a great deal of hesitation, and a description from\nthe sculptor of what he thought excellently appropriate for\nsuch magnificence, they accepted my study. The present Downige,\nreally--though I understand there is another pretentious branch in\nHesperia--bullied them into it. He cursed the Beaux-Arts graduate with\nthe most brutal and satisfactory freedom--the tyranny of his money; the\ncrown, you see, of Simon's hope.\"\n\nHe unwrapped one by one the wet cloths; and Linda, in an eagerness sharp\nlike anxiety, finally saw the statue, under life-size, of a seated man\nwith a rough stick and bundle at his feet. A limp hat was in his hand,\nand, beneath a brow to which the hair was plastered by sweat, his eyes\ngazed fixed and aspiring into a hidden dream perfectly created by his\ndesire. Here, she realized at last, she had a glimmer of the beauty, the\ncreative force, that animated Dodge Pleydon. Simon Downige's shoes were\nclogged with mud, his entire body, she felt, ached with weariness; but\nhis gaze--nothing Linda discovered but shadows over two depressions--was\nfar away in the attainment of his place of justice and truth.\n\nShe found a stool and, careless of the film of dust, sat absorbed in the\nfigure. Pleydon again had lost all consciousness of their presence; he\nstood, hands in pockets, his left foot slightly advanced, looking at his\nwork from under drawn brows. Arnaud spoke first:\n\n\"It's impertinent to congratulate you, Pleydon. You know what you've\ndone better than any one else could. You have all our admiration.\" Linda\nwatched the tenderness with which the other covered Simon Downige's\nvision in clay. Later, returning home after dinner, Arnaud speculated\nabout Pleydon's remarkable increase in power. \"I had given him up,\" he\nwent on; \"I thought he was lost in those notorious debauches of esthetic\nemotions. Does he still speak of loving you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Linda replied. \"Are you annoyed by it?\" He answered, \"What\ngood if I were?\" She considered him, turned in his chair to face\nher, thoughtfully. \"I haven't the slightest doubt of its quality,\nhowever--all in that Hesperia of old Downige's. To love you, my dear\nLinda, has certain well-defined resemblances to a calamity. If you ask\nme if I object to what you do give him, my answer must shock the gods of\nart. I would rather you didn't.\"\n\n\"What is it, Arnaud?\" she demanded. \"I haven't the slightest idea. I\nwish I had.\"\n\n\"Platonic,\" he told her shortly. \"The term has been hopelessly ruined,\nyet the sense, the truth, I am forced to believe, remains.\"\n\n\"But you know how stupid I am and that I can't understand you.\"\n\n\"The woman in whom a man sees God,\" he proceeded irritably:\n\n\"'_La figlia della sua mente, l'amorosa, idea_.'\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she cried, wrung with a sharp obscure hurt. \"I know that, I've\nheard it before.\" Her excitement faded at her absolute inability to\nplace the circumstances of her memory. The sound of the words vanished,\nleaving no more than the familiar deep trouble, the disappointing\nsensation of almost grasping--Linda was unable to think what.\n\n\"After all, you are my wife.\" He had recovered his normal shy humor.\n\"I can prove it. You are the irreproachable mother of our unsurpassed\nchildren. You have a hopeless vision--like this Simon's--of seeing me\npolished and decently pressed; and I insist on your continuing with the\nwhole show.\"\n\nHer mind arbitrarily shifted to the thought of her father, who had\nwalked out of his house, left--yes--his family, without any intimation.\nThen, erratically, it turned to Vign\u00c3\u00a9, to Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and young Sandby with\nhis fresh cheeks and impending penniless years acquiring a comprehension\nof the bond market. She said, \"I wonder if she really likes Bailey?\"\nArnaud's energy of dismay was laughable, \"What criminal folly! They\nhaven't finished Mother Goose yet.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nLinda, who expected to see Pleydon's statue of Simon Downige finished\nimmediately in a national recognition of its splendor, was disappointed\nby his explanation that, probably, it would not be ready for casting\nwithin two years. He intended to model it again, life-size, before he\nwas ready for the heroic. April, the vivifying, had returned; and,\nas always in the spring, Linda was mainly conscious of the mingled\nassuaging sounds of life newly admitted through open windows. A single\nshaded lamp was lighted by a far table, where Arnaud sat cutting the\npages of _The Living Age_ with an ivory blade; Dodge was blurred in the\nsemi-obscurity.\n\nHe came over to see them more frequently now, through what he called the\ngreat moment--so tiresomely extended--of his life. Pleydon came oftener\nbut he said infinitely less. It was his custom to arrive for dinner and\nsuddenly depart early or late in the evening. At times she went up\nto her room and left the two almost morosely silent men to their own\nthoughts or pages; at others she complained--no other woman alive would\nstay with such uninteresting and thoroughly selfish creatures. They\nnever made the pretense of an effort to consider or amuse her. At this\nArnaud would put aside his book and begin an absurd social conversation\nin the manner of Vign\u00c3\u00a9's associates. Pleydon, however, wouldn't speak;\nnothing broke the somberness of his passionate absorption in invisible\ntyrannies. She gave up, finally, a persistent effort to lighten his\nmoods. Annoyed she told him that if he did not change he'd be sick, and\nthen where would everything be.\n\nAll at once, through the open window, she heard Stella, her mother,\nlaughing; the carelessly gay sound overwhelmed her with an instinctive\nunreasoning dread. Linda rose with a half gasp--but of course it was\nVign\u00c3\u00a9 in the garden with Bailey Sandby.\n\nShe sank back angry because she had been startled; but her irritation\nperished in disturbing thought. It wasn't, she told herself, Vign\u00c3\u00a9's\nactions that made her fear the future so much as her, Linda's, knowledge\nof the possibilities of the past. Her undying hatred of that existence\nchoked in her throat; the chance of its least breath touching Vign\u00c3\u00a9,\nArnaud's daughter, roused her to any embittered hazard.\n\nThe girl, she was certain, returned a part at least of Bailey's feeling.\nLinda expected no confidences--what had she done to have them?--and\nArnaud was right, affairs of the heart were never revealed until\nconsummated. Her conclusion had been reached by indirect quiet\ndeductions. Vign\u00c3\u00a9, lately, was different; her attitude toward her mother\nhad changed to the subtle reserve of feminine maturity. Her appearance,\novernight, it seemed, had improved; her color was deeper, a delicate\nflush burned at any surprise in her cheeks, and the miracle of her body\nwas perfected.\n\nIt wasn't, Linda continued silently, that Vign\u00c3\u00a9 could ever follow the\nexample of Stella Condon through the hotels and lives of men partly\nbald, prodigal, and with distant families. Whatever happened to her\nwould be in excellent surroundings and taste; but the result--the\nsordid havoc, inside and out, the satiety alternating with the points\nof brilliancy, and finally, inexorably, sweeping over them in a leaden\ntide--would be identical. She wondered a little at the strength of her\ndetestation for such living; it wasn't moral in any sense with which she\nwas familiar; in fact it appeared to have a vague connection with her\nown revolt from the destruction of death. She wanted Vign\u00c3\u00a9 as well to\nescape that catastrophe, to hold inviolate the beauty of her youth, her\nfineness and courage.\n\nShe was convinced, too, that if she loved Bailey, and was disappointed,\nsome of the harm would be done immediately; Linda saw, in imagination,\nthe pure flame of Vign\u00c3\u00a9's passion fanned and then arbitrarily\nextinguished. She saw the resemblance of the dead woman, all those other\npainted shades, made stronger. A sentence formed so vividly in her mind\nthat she looked up apprehensively, certain that she had spoken it aloud:\n\nIf Vign\u00c3\u00a9 does come to care for him they must marry.\n\nHer thoughts left the girl for Arnaud--he would absolutely oppose her\nthere, and she speculated about the probable length his opposition would\nreach. What would he say to her? It couldn't be helped, in particular it\ncouldn't be explained, neither to him nor to the friendly correctness of\nBailey Sandby's mother. She, alone, must accept any responsibility, all\nblame.\n\nThe threatened situation developed more quickly than she had\nanticipated. Linda met Bailey, obviously disturbed, in the portico,\nleaving their house; his manner, mechanically, was good; and then, with\nan irrepressible boyish rush of feeling, he stopped her:\n\n\"Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and I love each other and Mr. Hallet won't hear of it. He\ninsulted us with the verse about the old woman who went to the cupboard\nto get a bone, and if he hadn't been her father--\" he breathed a\nportentous and difficult self-repression. \"Then he took a cowardly\nadvantage of my having no money, just now; right after I explained how I\nwas going to make wads--with Vign\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nAn indefinable excitement possessed Linda, accompanied by a sudden acute\nfear of what Arnaud might say. She wanted more than anything else in\nlife to go quickly, inattentively, past Bailey Sandby and up to her\nroom. Nothing could be easier, more obvious, than her disapproval of a\nmoneyless boy. She made a step forward with an assumed resolute ignoring\nof his disturbed presence. It was useless. A dread greater than her\nfright at Arnaud held her in the portico, her hand lifted to the\npolished knob of the inner door. Linda turned slowly, cold and white,\n\"Wait,\" she said to his shoulder in an admirable coat; then she gazed\nsteadily into his frank pained eyes.\n\n\"How do you know that you love Vign\u00c3\u00a9?\" she demanded. \"You are so young\nto be certain it will last always. And Vign\u00c3\u00a9--\"\n\n\"How does any one know?\" he replied. \"How did you? Married people always\nforget their own experiences, the happy way things went with them.\nFrom all I see money hasn't much to do with loving each other. But, of\ncourse, I'm not going to be poor, not with Vign\u00c3\u00a9. Nobody could. She'd\ninspire them. Mr. Hallet knows all about me, too; and he's the oldest\nkind of a friend of the family. I suppose when he sees father at the\nRittenhouse Club they'll have a laugh--a laugh at Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and me.\" His\nhand, holding the brim of a soft brown hat, clenched tensely.\n\n\"No,\" Linda told him, \"they won't do that.\" Her obscure excitement was\ncommunicated to him. \"Why not?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Because,\" she paused to steady her voice, \"because I am going to take a\nvery great responsibility. If it fails, if you let it fail, you'll ruin\never so much. Yes, Mr. Hallet, I am sure, will consent to your marrying\nVign\u00c3\u00a9.\" She escaped at the first opening from his incoherent gratitude.\nArnaud was in the library, and she stopped in the hall, busy with the\nloosening of her veil. Perhaps it would be better to speak to him after\ndinner; she ought to question Vign\u00c3\u00a9 first; but, as she stood debating,\nher daughter passed her tempestuously, blurred with crying, and Arnaud\nangrily demanded her presence.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\n\"You were quite right,\" he cried; \"this young idiot Sandby has been\ntelling Vign\u00c3\u00a9 that he loves her; and now Vign\u00c3\u00a9 assures me, with tears,\nthat she likes it! They want to get married--next week, tomorrow, this\nevening.\" Linda stood by the window; soon the magnolia-tree would be\nagain laden with flowers. She gathered her courage into a determined\ncomposure of tone. \"I saw Bailey outside,\" she admitted. \"He told me. It\nseems excellent to me.\"\n\nArnaud Hallet incredulously challenged her. \"What do you mean--that you\ngave him a trace of encouragement!\" Linda replied:\n\n\"I said that I was certain you would consent.\" She halted his\nexasperated gesture. \"You think Vign\u00c3\u00a9 is nothing but a child, and yet\nshe is as old as I was at our wedding. My mother was no older when\nBartram Lowrie married her. I think Vign\u00c3\u00a9 is very fortunate, Bailey is\nas nice as possible; and, as he said, it isn't as if you knew nothing of\nthe Sandbys; they are as dignified as the Lowries.\"\n\nAn expression she had never before seen hardened his countenance into\na sarcasm that travestied his customary humor. \"You realize, of course,\nthat except for what his father gives him young Sandby is wretchedly\npoor. He's nice enough but what has that to do with it? And, in\nparticular, how does it touch you, Linda Condon? Do you suppose I can\never forget your answer that time I first asked you to marry me? You\nwouldn't consider a poor man; you were worth, really, a hundred thousand\na year; but, if nothing better came along, you might sacrifice yourself\nfor fifty.\"\n\n\"I remember very well,\" she answered; \"and, curiously enough, I am\nnot ashamed. I was very sensible then, in a horrible position with\nextravagant habits. They were me. I couldn't change myself. Without\nmoney I should have made you, any man, entirely miserable. Arnaud, I\nhadn't--I haven't now--the ability to see everything important through\nthe affections, like so many many women. You often told me that; who\nhasn't? I have always admitted it wasn't pleasant nor praiseworthy. But\nhow, to use your own words, does all that affect Vign\u00c3\u00a9? She isn't cold\nbut very warm-hearted; and, instead of my experience, she has her own so\nmuch better feeling.\"\n\n\"I absolutely refuse to allow anything of the sort,\" he declared\nsharply. \"I won't even discuss it--for three years. Tell this Sandby\ninfant, if you like, to come back then.\"\n\n\"In three years, or in one year, Vign\u00c3\u00a9 may be quite different, yes-less\nlovable. Happiness, too, is queer, Arnaud; there isn't a great deal of\nit. Not an overwhelming amount. If it appears for an instant it must be\nheld as tightly as possible. It doesn't come back, you know. Don't turn\nto your book yet--you can't get rid of us, of Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and me, like that;\nand then it's rude; the first time, I believe, you have ever been\nimpolite to me.\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he spoke formally. \"You seem to think that I am as\nindifferent as yourself. You might be asking the day of the week to\njudge from your calm appearance. The emotion of a father, or even of\na mother, perhaps, you have never explored. On the whole you are\nfortunate. And you are always protected by your celebrated honesty.\" She\nsaid:\n\n\"I promised Bailey your consent.\"\n\n\"Why bother about that? It isn't necessary for your new romantic mood.\nAn elopement, with you to steady the ladder, would be more appropriate.\"\n\nShe repeated the fact of her engagement. Her dread for him had vanished,\nits place now taken by a distrust of what, in her merged detachment and\nsuffering, she might blunderingly do. At the back of this she realized\nthat his case, his position, was hopeless. Without warning, keen and\nundimmed, his love for her flashed through his resentful misery. There\nwas no spoken acknowledgement of surrender; he sank into his chair\ndejected and pitiable, infinitely gray. His shoes, on the brightness of\nthe hooked rug, were dingy, his coat drawn and wrinkled.\n\nLinda saw herself on her knees before him, before his patience and\ngenerosity, sobbing her contrition into his forgiving hands. She\nlonged with every nerve--as she had so often before--to lose herself in\npassionate emotion. She had never been more erect or withdrawn, never\nessentially less touched. After a little, waiting for him to speak,\nshe saw that he, too, had retreated into the profound depths of his own\nillusions and despairs.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nFor a surprising while--even in the face of Vign\u00c3\u00a9's radiance--Arnaud\nwas as still and shadowed as the inert surface of a dammed stream. Then\nslowly, the slenderest trickle at first, his wit revived his spirit; and\nhe opened an unending mock-solemn attack on Bailey Sandby's eminently\nserious acceptance of the responsibilities of his allowed love.\n\nThe boy had left the university, and his father--a striking replica of\nArnaud's prejudices, impatience and fundamental kindness--exchanged with\nVign\u00c3\u00a9's male parent the most dismal prophecies together with concrete\nplans for their children's future security. This, inevitably, resulted\nin Vign\u00c3\u00a9's marriage; a ceremony unattended by Pleydon except by the\npresence of a very liberal check.\n\nThe life-size version of his Simon Downige was again under way--it had\nbeen torn down, Linda knew, more than once--and he was in a fever of\ncomposition. Nor was this, she decided with Arnaud, his only oppression:\nthe Asiatic fever clung to him with disquieting persistence. Pleydon\nhimself admitted he had a degree or two in the evening.\n\nLinda was seated in his studio near Central Park West, perhaps a year\nlater, and she observed aloud that so much wet clay around was bad for\nhim. He laughed: nothing now could happen to him, he was forever beyond\naccident, sickness, death--his statue for the monument in Hesperia was\nfinished. It stood revealed before them, practically as Linda had first\nseen it, but enlarged, towering, as if the vision it portrayed had\ngrown, would continue to grow eternally, because of the dignity of its\nhope, the necessity of its realization.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"it will go to the foundry and be cast.\" He corrected\nher. \"You will go to the foundry and be cast ... in bronze.\" A distinct\ngraceful happiness possessed her at the knowledge that his love for her\nwas as constant as though it, too, were metal. Not flesh but bronze,\nspirit, he insisted.\n\nThe multiplying years made that no more comprehensible than when, a\nchild, she had thrilled in a waking dream. Love, spirit, death. Three\nmysteries. But only one, she thought, was inevitably hers, the last. To\nbe loved was not love itself, but only the edge of its cloak;\nresponse was an indivisible part of realization. No, sterility was the\nmeasure--of its absence. And she was, Linda felt, in spite of Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and\nLowrie, the latter a specially vigorous contradiction, the most sterile\nwoman alive. There were always Dodge's assurances, but clay, stone,\nmetal, were cold for a belief to embrace. And she was, she knew,\nlovelier now than she had ever been before, than she would ever be\nagain.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\nThe faint ringing of the bell from outside that probably announced\nArnaud sounded unreal, futile, to Linda. He came into the studio, and\nat once a discussion began between the two men of the difference in\nthe surfaces of clay and bronze. The talk then shifted to the pictorial\nsources of the heroic Simon Downige before them, and Linda declared,\n\"Dodge, you have never made a head of me. How very unflattering!\"\n\n\"You're an affair for a painter,\" he replied; \"Goya or Alfred Stevens.\nNo one but Goya could have found a white for you, with the quality of\nflower petals; and Stevens would have fixed you in an immortality of\ndelicate color, surrounded by your Philadelphia garden.\" He stood quite\nclose to her, with his jacket dragged forward by hands thrust into its\npockets, and he added at the end of a somber interrogation, \"But if you\nwould really like to know why--\"\n\nIn a moment more, she recognized, Dodge would explain his feeling for\nher--to Arnaud, to any one who might be present. The gleam in his\neyes, his remoteness from earthly concern, were definitely not normal.\nPleydon, his love, terrified her. \"No,\" she said with an assumed hurried\nlightness, \"don't try to explain. I must manage to survive the injury to\nmy vanity.\"\n\nThey left New York almost immediately, Pleydon suddenly determining to\ngo with them; and later were scattered through the Hallet household.\nVign\u00c3\u00a9 and her husband were temporarily living there; with their heads\nclose together they were making endless computations, numerous floor\nplans and elevations. Linda, at the piano in the drawing-room, could\nhear them through the hall. Pleydon was lounging in a chair beyond her.\nShe couldn't play but she was able, slowly, to pick out the notes\nof simple and familiar airs--echoes of Gluck and blurred motives of\nScarlatti. It was for herself, she explained; the sounds, however crude\nand disconnected, brought things back to her. What things, she replied\nto Pleydon's query, she didn't in the least know; but pleasant.\n\nThe fact that she understood so little depressed her with increasing\nfrequency. It was well enough to be ignorant as a girl, or even as a\nyoung woman newly married; but she had left all that behind; she had\nlost her youth without any compensating gain of knowledge. Linda could\nnot assure herself that life was clearer than it had been to her serious\nchildhood. It had always been easily measured on the surface; she\nhad had a very complete grasp of its material aspects almost at once,\naccomplishing exactly what she had planned. Perhaps this was all;\nand her trouble an evidence of weakness--the indecision, she saw\nwith contempt, that kept so many people in a constant agitation of\ndisappointment.\n\nPerhaps this was enough; more than the majority had or accomplished. She\nmade, again, a resolute effort to be contented, at rest. Her straying\nfingers clumsily wrought a fragmentary refrain that mocked her\ndetermination. It wasn't new, this--this dissatisfaction; but it had\ngrown sharper. As she was older her restlessness increased at the\nrealization that life, opportunity, were slipping from her. Soon she\nwould be forty.\n\nThe conviction seized her that most lives reflected hers in that their\nquestioning was never answered. The fortunate, then, were the incurious\nand the hearts undisturbed by a maddening thrill. She said aloud, \"The\nones who never heard music.\" Pleydon was without a sign that she had\nspoken. Her emotions were very delicate, very fragile, and enormously\ndifficult to perceive. They were like plants in stony ground. Where had\nshe heard that--out of the Bible? Then she thought of her failure to get\nanything from religion--a part of her inability to drink at the springs\nwhich others declared so refreshing. Linda pressed her hands more\nsharply on the keys and the answering discord had the effect of waking\nher to reality.\n\nPleydon remained until the following afternoon, and then was lost--in\nthe foundry casting his statue--for six months. Arnaud went over to view\nthe completion of the bronze and returned filled with enthusiasm. \"Its\nsimplicity is the surprising part,\" he told her. \"The barest statement\npossible. But Pleydon himself is in a disturbing condition; I can't\ndecide if it is mental or physical. The fever of course; yet that\ndoesn't account for his distance from ordinary living. The truth is, I\nsuppose, that men weren't designed for great arts, and nature, like\nthe jealous God of the Hebrews, retaliates. It is absurd, but Pleydon\nreminds me of you; you're totally different. I suppose it's because of\nthe detachment you have in common.\" He veered to a detail of Lowrie's\nfirst year at a university, and exhibited, against a decent endeavor to\nthe contrary, his boundless pride in their son.\n\nThe boy was, Linda acknowledged, more than commonly dependable and\nable. He was heavy, like his father, and so diffident that he almost\nstuttered; but his mental processes flashed in quick intuitive\nperceptions. Lowrie was an easy and brilliant student; and, perhaps\nbecause of this, of his mental certainty, he was not intimate with\nher as Arnaud had hoped and predicted. It seemed to Linda that he\ninstinctively penetrated her inner doubt and regarded it without\nsympathy. In this he was her son. Lowrie was a confident and\nunsympathetic critic of humanity.\n\nEven now, so soon, there was no question of his success in the law his\nfitness had elected. The springs of his being were purely intellectual,\nreasoning. In him Linda saw magnified her own coldness; and, turned on\nherself, she viewed it with an arbitrary feminine resentment. He was\nactually courteous to her; but under all their intercourse there was a\nperceptible impatience. His scorn of other women, girls, however, was\nopenly expressed and honest; it had no trace of the mere affectation\nof pessimism natural to his age. Arnaud, less thoughtful than she, was\nvastly entertained by this, and drew Lowrie out in countless sly sallies\nand contradictions.\n\nYes, he would succeed, but, after all, what would his success be\nworth--placed, that was, against Vign\u00c3\u00a9's radiant happiness, Bailey\nSandby's quiet eyes and the quality of his return home each evening?\n\nHer thoughts came back to Pleydon--she had before her a New York paper\ndescribing the ceremony of unveiling his Simon Downige at Hesperia.\nThere was a long learned article praising its beauty and emphasizing\nPleydon's eminence. He was, it proceeded, an anomaly in an age of\nmomentary experimental talents--a humanized Greek force. He didn't\nbelong to to-day but to yesterday and to-morrow. This gave her an\nuncomfortable vision of Dodge in space, with no warm points of contact.\nShe, too, was suspended in that vague emptiness. Linda had the sensation\nof grasping at streamers, forms, of sparkling mist. A strange position\nin view of her undeniable common sense, the solid foundations of her\ntemperament and experience. She saw from the paper, further, that the\nDownige who had commissioned the monument was dead.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\nIn the middle of the festive period that connected Christmas with the\nnew year Arnaud turned animatedly from his breakfast scanning of the\nnews. \"It seems,\" he told her, \"that a big rumpus has developed in\nHesperia over the Pleydon statue--the present Downige omnipotence, never\nfriendly with our old gentleman, has condemned its bronze founder.\nYou know what I mean. It's an insult to their pride, their money and\nposition, to see him perpetuated as a tramp. On the contrary he was a\nvery respectable individual from a prominent family and town.\n\n\"They have been moving the local heavens, ever since the monument was\nplaced, to have it set aside. I suppose they would have succeeded,\ntoo, if a large amount given to the city were not contingent on its\npreservation. But then they can always donate more money in the cause of\ntheir sacred respectability.\"\n\nLinda had never, she exclaimed, heard of anything more disgusting. It\nwas plain that Hesperia knew nothing of art. \"Every one,\" she ran on\nin the heat of her resentment, \"every one, that is, who should decide,\nagrees it's magnificent. They were frightfully lucky to get it--Dodge's\nfinest work.\" She wrote at once to Pleydon commanding his presence and\nexpressing her contempt of such depravity of opinion. To her surprise he\nwas undisturbed, apparently, by the condemnation of his monument.\n\nHe even laughed at her energy of scorn. She was hurt, perceptibly\nsilenced, with a feeling of having been misunderstood or rather\nundervalued. Her disturbance at any blame attached to the statue of\nSimon Downige was extremely acute. But, she thought, if it failed to\nworry Dodge why should she bother. She did, in spite of this philosophy;\nSimon was tremendously important to her.\n\nHe stood for things: she had watched his evolution from the clay sketch,\nand in Pleydon's mind, to the final heroic proportions; and she had\ntaken for granted that a grateful world would see him in her light.\nA woman, she decided, had made the trouble; and she hated her with a\npersonal vigor. Pleydon said:\n\n\"I told you that old Simon was unbalanced; now you can see it by his\nreception in a successful city. The sculptor--do you remember him, a\nBeaux-Arts graduate?--admits that he had always opposed it, but that\npolitical motives overbore his pure protest. There is a scheme now to\nbuild a pavilion, for babies, and shut out the monument from open view.\nThey may do that but time will sweep away their walls. If I had\nmodeled Simon Downige, yes, he would go; but I modeled his vision, his\naspiration--the hope of all men for release and purity.\n\n\"Downige and the individual babies are unimportant compared to a vision\nof perfection, of escape. As long as men live, if they live, they'll\nreach up; and that gesture in itself is heaven. Not accomplishment. The\nspirit dragging the flesh higher; but spirit alone--empty balloons. A\ndream in bronze, harder even than men's heads, more durable than their\nprejudices, so permanent that it will wear out their ignorance; and in\nthe end--always in the end--they'll bring their wreath.\n\n\"A replica has gone to Cottarsport, from me; and you ought to see\nit there, on a block of New England granite. It's in the Common, a\nwindswept reach with low houses and a white steeple and the sea. It\nmight have been there from the beginning, rising on rock against the\npale salt day. They can go to hell in Hesperia.\"\n\nStill Linda's hurt persisted; she saw the unfortunate occurrence as a\ndirect blow at her pride. Arnaud, too, failed her; he was splendid in\nhis assault upon such rapacious stupidity; but it was only an impersonal\nconcern. His manner expressed the conviction that it might have been\nexpected. He was blind to her special enthusiasm, her long intimate\nconnection with the statue. Exasperated she almost told him that it was\nmore real to her than their house, than Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and Lowrie, than he. She\nwas stopped, fortunately, by the perception that, amazingly, the statue\nwas more actual than Dodge Pleydon. It touched the center of her life\nmore nearly.\n\nWhy, she didn't know.\n\nIf her mental confusion increased by as much as a feeling, Linda\nthought, she would be close to madness. It was unbearable at practically\nforty.\n\nLowrie said, at the worst possible moment, that he found the entire\nepisode ridiculously overemphasized. A statue more or less was of small\nimportance. If the Downige family were upset why didn't they employ\nan able lawyer to dispose of it? There were many ways for such a\nproceeding--\n\n\"I have no desire to hear them,\" she interrupted. \"You seem to know a\ntremendous lot, but what good it will do you in the end who can say!\nAnd, with all your cleverness, you haven't an ounce of appreciation for\nart. Besides, I hate to see any one as young as you so sure of himself.\nOften I suspect you are patronizing your father and me. It's not pretty\nnor polite.\"\n\nLowrie was obviously embarrassed by her attack, and managed the abrupt\nsemblance of an apology. Arnaud, who had put down his eternal book, said\nnothing until the boy had vanished. \"Wasn't that rather sharp?\" he\nasked mildly. \"Perhaps,\" she replied in a tone without warmth or regret.\n\"Somehow I am never comfortable with Lowrie.\"\n\n\"You are too much alike,\" he shrewdly observed. \"It is laughable at\ntimes. Did you expect your children to be fountains of sentiment?\nAnd, look here--if I can get along in comfort with you for life you in\nparticular ought to put up peacefully with Lowrie. He is a damned sight\nmore human than, at bottom, you are; a woman of alabaster.\"\n\n\"I loathe quarrels,\" she admitted; \"they are so vulgar. You know that\nthey are not like me and just said so. Oh, Arnaud, why does life get\nharder instead of easier?\"\n\nHe put his book aside completely and gazed at her in patient thought.\n\"Linda,\" he said finally, \"I have never heard anything that stirred me\nso much; not what you said, my dear, but the recognition in your voice.\"\nA wistfulness of love for her enveloped him; an ineffable desire as vain\nas the passion she struggled to give him in return. She smiled in an\nunhappiness of apology.\n\n\"Perhaps--\" he stopped, waiting any assurance whatever, his face eager\nlike a dusty lamp in which the light had been turned sharply up. She was\nunable to stir, to move her gaze from his hopeful eyes, to mitigate by a\nbreath her slender white aloofness. A smile different from hers,\ntender with remission, lingered in his fading irradiation. The dusk was\ngathering, adding its melancholy to his age--sixty-five now. Why that\nwas an old man! Her sympathy vanished in her shrinking from the twilight\nthat was, as well, slowly, inevitably, deepening about her.\n\nIt was laughable that, as she approached an age whose only resource\nwas tranquillity, she grew more restless. Her present vague agitation\nbelonged ridiculously to youth. The philosophy of the evident that had\nsupported her so firmly was breaking at the most inopportune time. And\nit was, she told herself, too late for anything new; the years for\nthat had been spent insensibly with Arnaud. Linda was very angry with\nherself, for, in all her shifting state of mind, she preserved an inner\nnecessity for the quality of exactness expressed in her clothes. There\nwere literally no neglected spaces in her conscious living.\n\nHer thoughts finally centered about the statue in Hesperia--it presented\nan actual mark for her fleeting resentments. She wondered why it so\nlargely occupied her thoughts, moved her so personally. She watched the\npapers for the scattered reports of the progress of the contention it\nhad roused, some ill-natured, others supposedly humorous, and nearly\nall uninformed. She became, Arnaud said, the champion of the esthetic\nagainst Dagon. He elaborated this picture until she was forced to smile\nagainst her inclination, her profound seriousness. Linda had the feeling\nthat she, too, was on the pedestal that held the bronze effigy of Simon\nDownige challenging the fog that obscured men. Its fate was hers. She\ndidn't pretend to explain how.\n\nAs time passed it seemed to her that it took her longer and longer to\ndress in the morning, while her preparations couldn't be simpler; her\nhabit of deliberation had become nearly a vice, the precision of her\nruffles, her hair, a tyranny. She never quite lost the satisfaction of\nher mirror's faultless reflection; and stopped, now, for a moment's\ncalm interrogation of the being--hardly more silvery cool than the\nreality--before her.\n\nArnaud was at the table, and the gaze with which he met her was\ntroubled. The morning paper, she saw, was, against custom, at her place,\nand she picked it up with an instinctive sense of calamity. The blackly\nprinted sensational headline that immediately established her fear sank\nvivid and entire into her brain: an anonymous inflamed mob in Hesperia\nhad pulled down and destroyed Pleydon's statue. Their act was described\nas a tribute to the liberality of the present Downige family in the\nlight of its objection to the monument.\n\nAs if in the development of her feeling Linda had a sensation of\ncrashing with a sickening violence from a pedestal to the ground.\nActually, it seemed, the catastrophe had happened to her. She heard,\nwith a sense of inutility, Arnaud denouncing the outrage; he had a\npencil in his hand for the composition of a telegram to Dodge. He\npaid--but perhaps only naturally--no attention to her, suffering dully\nfrom her fall. She shuddered before the recreated lawless approaching\nvoice of the mob; the naked ugly violence froze her with terror; she\nfelt the gross hurried hands winding ropes about her, the rending\nbrutality of force--\n\nShe sat and automatically took a small carved glass of orange-juice\nfrom a bed of ice, and her chilled fingers recalled a dim image of her\nmother. Arnaud was speaking, \"I'm afraid this will cut through Pleydon's\nsecurity, it was such a wanton destruction of his unique power. You see,\nhe worked lovingly over the cast with little files and countless finite\nimprovements. The mold, I think, was broken. What a piece of luck the\nthing's at Cottarsport.\" He paused, obviously expecting her to comment;\nbut suddenly phrases failed her.\n\nIn place of herself she should be considering Dodge; her sympathy even\nfor him was submerged in her own extraordinary injury. However, she\nrecovered from her first gasping shock, and made an utterly commonplace\nremark. Never had her sense of isolation been stronger. \"I must admit,\"\nher husband continued, \"that I looked for some small display of concern.\nI give you my word there are moments when I think Pleydon himself cut\nyou out of stone. He isn't great enough for that, though; in the way\nof perfection you successfully gild the lily. A thing held to be\nimpossible.\"\n\nLinda told him with amazing inanity that his opinion of her was\nunreliable; and, contented, he lightly pursued his admiration of what\nhe called her boreal charm. At intervals she responded appropriately\nand proceeded with breakfast. She had entered a region of dispassionate\nconsideration, her characteristic detachment, she thought, regained. She\nmentally, calmly, reconstructed the motives and events that had led to\nthe destruction of the statue; they, at least, were evident to her.\nShe reaffirmed silently her conviction that it had resulted from the\nstupidity, the vanity, of a woman. The limitations of men, fully as\nnarrow, operated in other directions.\n\nThen, with an incredulous surprise, she was aware that the clear space\nof her reason was filling with anger. Never before had such a flood\nof emotion possessed her; and she surrendered herself, in an\nenormous relief, to the novelty of its obliterating tide. It deepened\nimmeasurably, sweeping her far from the security of old positions of\nindifference and critical self-possession. Linda became enraged at\na world that had concentrated all its degraded vulgarity in one\nunspeakable act.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\nIt was fall, October, and the day was a space of pale gold foliage\nwreathed in blue garlands of mist. The gardener was busy with a wooden\nrake and wheelbarrow in which he carted away dead leaves for burning.\nThe fire was back of the low fence, in the rear, and Linda, at the\ndining-room window, could hear the fierce small crackle of flames; the\ndrifting pungent smoke was like a faint breath of ammonia. Arnaud had\nleft for the day, Lowrie was at the university, while Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and her\nhusband--moving toward their ultimate colonial threshold--had taken a\nsmall house. She was alone.\n\nAs usual.\n\nHowever, in her present state her solitude had lost its inevitability;\nshe failed to see why it must continue until the end of time. She could\nno longer discover a sufficient reason for her limitless endurance,\nher placid acceptance of all that chance, or any inconsiderable person,\nhappened to dictate. She wasn't like that in the least. Her temper had\nsolidified as though it were ice, taking everywhere the form in which\nit was held. It was a reality. She determined, as well, that her feeling\nshould not melt back into the familiar acceptance of a routine that had\nled her blindfolded across such an extent of life.\n\nShe understood now, in a large part, her disturbance at the indignity\nto Dodge's monument--he had assured her that she was its inspiration;\nexcept for her it would never have been realized, he would have kept\non modeling those Newport fountains, continued with the Susanna Nodas,\nspending himself ignobly. He loved her, and that love had resulted in a\nstatue the world of art, of taste, honored. But it was she all the while\nthey were approving, discussing, writing about, Linda Condon.\n\nShe had always been that, Pleydon had informed her, never Linda\nHallet--in spite of Arnaud and their children. It sounded like nonsense;\nbut, at the bottom, it was truth. Of course it couldn't be explained,\nfor example, to the man who had every right, every evidence, to consider\nhimself her husband. Nothing was susceptible of explanation. Absolutely\nnothing! There was the earth, which appeared to be everything, the\nhouses you entered, the streets you passed over, the people among whom\nyou lived, yet that wasn't all. Heavens, no! It was quite unimportant\ncompared with--with other facts latent in the mind and blood.\n\nDodge Pleydon's love was one of those other facts; it was simply\nimpossible to deny its existence, its power. Dodge had been totally\nchanged by it, born over again. But she, who had been the source, had\nhad no good from it, nothing except the thrill that had always been\nhers. No one knew of it, counted it as her achievement, paid the\nslightest attention to her. Arnaud smiled indulgently, Lowrie scoffed.\nWhen the statue had been thrown down they thought of it merely as a\ndeplorable part of the day's news. They hadn't seen that she, Linda\nCondon, was unspeakably insulted.\n\nShe doubted if she could bring them to comprehend what had happened--to\nher. Or if Arnaud understood, if she made it plain, what good would be\ndone! That wouldn't save her, put her back again on the pedestal. The\nlatter was necessary. Linda recognized that a great deal of her feeling\nwas based on pride; but it was a pride entirely justified. She had no\nintention of submitting to the coarse hands and ropes of public affront.\nThroughout her life she had rebelled against any profanation of her\nperson, she had hated to be touched.\n\nEvery instinct, she found, every delicate self-opinion, was bound into\nPleydon's success; the latter had kept her alive. Without it existence\nwould have been intolerable. It was unbearable now.\n\nShe discharged the small daily duties of her efficient housekeeping with\na contemptuous exactness; for years she had accomplished, in herself,\nnothing more. But at last a break had come. Linda recognized this\nwithout any knowledge of what reparation it would find. She wasn't\nconcerned with that, a small detail. It would be apparent. Arnaud\nwas silent through dinner; tired, it seemed. She saw him as if at the\ndistant end of a dull corridor--as she looked back. There was no change\nin her liking for him. Mechanically she noticed the disorder of his\nscant hair and rumpled sleeves.\n\nNot until, waking sharply, in the middle of the night, did she have a\nglimpse of a possible course--she might live with Dodge and perfectly\nexpress both her retaliation and her accomplishment. In that way she\nwould reestablish herself beside him and place their vision in bronze on\nan elevation beyond the spite of the envious and the blind.\n\nIt was so directly simple that she was surprised it hadn't occurred\nto her before. The possibility had always been a part, unsuspected and\nvaluable, of her special being; the largely condemned faults of\nher character and experience had at least brought her this--a not\ninconsiderable freedom in a world everywhere barred by the necessity\nfor upholding a hypocritical show of superiority to honest desire. The\ndetachment that deprived her of life's conventional joys released\nher from its common obligations. That conviction, however, was too\nintimately connected with all her inheritance to bring her any conscious\ndramatic sense of rebellion or high feeling of justified indignation.\n\nSleep had deserted her, and she waited for the dawn in the windows that\nwould bring her escape. It was very slow coming; the blackness took on\na grayer tone, like ink with added faint infusions of water. Slowly the\nblackness dissolved and she heard the stir of the sparrows in the ivy.\nThere was the passing rumble of an early electric car on the paved aged\nstreet, the blurred hurried shuffle of a workman's clumsy shoes. The\nbrightening morning was cool with a premonitory touch of frost; at the\nwindow she saw a vanishing silver sheen on the lawn and board fence.\n\nA sensation of youth pervaded her; and while, perhaps, it was out of\nkeeping with her years, she had still her vitality unspent; she was\nwithout a trace of the momentary frost on the grass. She was tranquil,\nleisurely; her heart evenly sent its life through her unflushed body.\nPiece by piece she put on her web-like garments, black and white;\nbrushing the heavy stream of her hair and tying the inevitable sash\nabout her supple waist.\n\nBelow she met Arnaud with an unpleasant shock--she hadn't given him\na thought. Her feeling now was hardly more than annoyance at her\nforgetfulness. He would be terribly distressed at her going, and she was\ngenuinely sorry for this, poised at the edge of an explanation of her\npurpose. Arnaud was putting butter and salt into his egg-cup, after\nthat he would grind the pepper from a French mill--pure spices were a\nprecision of his--and she waited until the operation was completed.\n\nThen it occurred to her that all she could hope to accomplish by\nadmitting her intention was the ruin of his last hour alone with her.\nHe was happier, gayer, than usual. But his age was evident in his voice,\nhis gestures. Linda marveled at her coldness, her ruthless disregard of\nArnaud's claim on her, of his affection as deep as Pleydon's, perhaps no\nless fine but not so imperative. Yet Arnaud had had over twenty years of\nher life, the best; and she had never deceived him about the quality\nof her gift. It was right, now, for Dodge to have the remainder.\nBut whether it were right or wrong, there was no failure of her\ndetermination to go to Pleydon in the vindication of her existence.\n\nShe delayed speaking to Arnaud until, suddenly, breakfast was over. He\nseldom went to the law office where he had been a partner, but stayed\nabout the lower floor of his house, in the library or directing small\noutside undertakings. Either that or he left, late, for the Historical\nSociety, with which his connection and interest were uninterrupted.\nAs Linda passed him in the hall he was fumbling in the green bag that\naccompanied all his journeyings into the city; and she gathered that he\nintended to make one of his occasional sallies. She proceeded above,\nto her room, where with steady hands she pinned on her hat. It would\nbe impossible to take any additional clothes, and she'd have to content\nherself with something ready-made until she could order others in\nthe establishment of her living with Dodge. Her close-fitting jacket,\ngloves, and a short cape of sables were collected; she gazed finally,\nthoughtfully, about the room, and then, with a subdued whisper of\nskirts, descended the stair. Arnaud was in the library, bending over\nthe table that bore his accumulation of papers and serious journals. A\nlingering impulse to speak was overborne by the memory of what, lately,\nshe had endured--she saw him at the dusty end of that long corridor\nthrough which she had monotonously journeyed, denied of her one triumph,\nlost in inconsequential shadows--and she continued firmly to the door\nwhich closed behind her with a normal mute smoothness, an inanimate\nsilence.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\nThe maid who admitted Linda to Pleydon's apartment, first replying,\n\"Yes, Mrs. Hallet. No, Mrs. Hallet,\" to her questions, continued in\nfuller sentences expressing a triumph of sympathy over mere correctness.\nShe lingered at the door of the informal drawing-room, imparting the\ninformation that Mr. Pleydon had become very irregular indeed about his\nmeals, and that his return for lunch was uncertain. Something, however,\nwould be prepared for her. Linda acknowledged this briefly. Often, with\nMr. Pleydon at home, he wouldn't so much as look at his dinner. Times,\ntoo, it seemed as though he had been in the studio all night. He went\nout but seldom now, and rarely remained away for more than an hour or\ntwo. Linda heard this without an indication of responsive interest,\nand the servant, returning abruptly from the excursion into humanity,\ndisappeared.\n\nShe was glad to have this opportunity alone to accustom herself to a\nnovel position. But she was once more annoyingly calm. Annoyingly, she\nreiterated; the fervor of her anger, which at the same time had been\nbitterly cold, had lessened. She was practically normal. She regarded\nthis, the loss of her unprecedented emotion, in the light of a fraud on\nher sanguine decision. Linda had counted on its support, its generous\nirresistible tide, to carry her through the remainder of her life with\nthe exhilaration she had so largely missed.\n\nHere in Dodge's room she was as placid, almost, as though she were in\nthe library at home. That customary term took its place in her thoughts\nbefore she recognized that, with her, it had shifted. However, it was\nunimportant--home had never been a magical word to her; it belonged in\nthe vast category which, of such universal weight, left her unstirred.\nShe resembled those Eastern people restlessly and perpetually moving\nacross sandy deserts as they exhausted, one after another, widely\nseparated scanty oases.\n\nShe studied the objects around her with the pleased recognition that\nthey were unique, valuable, and in faultless taste. Then she fell to\nwondering at the difference had Dodge been poor: she would have come to\nhim, Linda knew, just the same. But, she admitted frankly, it would\nhave been uncomfortable. Perhaps that--actual poverty, actual\ndeprivation--was what her character needed. A popular sentiment upheld\nsuch a view; she decided it was without foundation. There was no reason\nwhy beauty, finely appropriate surroundings, should damage the spirit.\n\nHer mind turned to an examination of her desertion of Arnaud, but she\ncould find no trace of conventional regret; of what, she felt, her\nsensation ought to be. The instinctive revolt from oblivion was an\ninfinitely stronger reality than any allegiance to abstract duty. She\nwas consumed by the passionate need to preserve the integrity of being\nherself. The word selfish occurred to her but to be met unabashed by the\nquery, why not? Selfishness was a reproach applied by those who failed\nto get what they wanted to all who succeeded. Linda wasn't afraid of\npublic opinion, censure; she didn't shrink even from the injury to her\nhusband. What Dodge would think, however, was hidden from her.\n\nShe had no doubt of his complete acceptance of all she offered; ordinary\nobligations to society bound him as little as they held her. It would be\nenough that she wanted to come to him.\n\nShe would bother him, change his habit of living, very little. Long\nyears of loneliness had taught her to be self-sufficient. Linda would\nbe too wise to insist on distasteful regularity in the interest of a\ncomparatively unimportant well-being. In short, she wouldn't bother him.\nThat must be made clear at once.\n\nMore than anything else he would be inexpressibly delighted to have her\nwith him, to find--at last--his love. Little intimacies of satin\nmules, glimpses, charming to an artist! He'd be faultless, too, in the\nrelationships where Arnaud as well had never for a moment deviated from\nbeautiful consideration. Two remarkable men. While her deficiency in\nhumor was admitted, she saw a glimmer of the absurd in her attitude and\npresent situation. The combination, at least, was uncommon. There had\nbeen no change in her feeling for either Arnaud or Dodge, their places\nin her being were undisturbed; she liked her husband no less, Dodge no\nbetter.\n\nLunch was announced, a small ceremony of covered silver dishes, heavy\ncrystal, Nankin china, and flowers. The linen, which was old, bore a\nmonogram unfamiliar to her--that of Dodge's mother, probably. When she\nhad finished, but was still lingering at the narrow refectory table, she\nheard Pleydon enter the hall and the explanatory voice of the servant.\nAn unexpected embarrassment pervaded her, but she overcame it by the\nrealization that there was no need for an immediate announcement of\nher purpose. Dodge would naturally suppose that she was in New York\nshopping.\n\nHe did, to her intense relief, with a moving pleasure that she had\nlunched with him. \"It's seldom,\" he went on, \"that you are so sensible.\nI hope you haven't any plans or concerts to drag you away immediately.\nI owe you a million strawberries; but, aside from that, I'd like you to\nstay as long as possible.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she replied quietly; \"I will.\"\n\nShe hadn't seen him since the statue at Hesperia had been destroyed, and\nshe tried faintly to tell him how much that outrage had hurt her. It had\ninjured him too, she realized; just as Arnaud predicted. He showed his\nage more gauntly, more absolutely, than the other. His skin was dry as\nthough the vitality of his countenance had been burned out by the flame\nvisible in his eyes.\n\n\"The drunken fools!\" he exclaimed of the mob that had torn Simon Downige\nfrom his eminence; \"they came by way of all the saloons in the city.\nFree drinks! That is the disturbing thing about what the optimistic call\ncivilization--the fact that it is always at the mercy of the ignorant\nand the brutal. There is no security; none, that is, except in the\nindividual spirit. And they, mostly, are the victims of a singular\ninsane resentment--Savonarola and there were greater.\n\n\"But you mustn't think, you mustn't suppose, that I mean it's\nhopeless. How could I? Who has had more from living? Love and complete\nself-expression. That exhausts every possibility. Three words. Remember\nCottarsport. But the love--ah,\" he smiled, but not directly at her.\nLinda was at once reassured and disturbed; and she rose, proceeding into\nthe drawing-room.\n\nThere she sat gracefully composed and with still hands; she never\nembroidered or employed her leisure with trivial useful tasks. Pleydon\nwas extended on a chair, his fingers caught beyond his head and his long\nlegs thrust out and crossed at the ankles. His gaze was fixed on her\nunwaveringly; and yet, when she tried to meet its focus, it went behind\nher as though it pierced the solidity of her body and the walls in the\ncontemplation of a far-removed shining image. Her disturbance grew to\nthe inclusion of a degree of fretfulness at his unbroken silence, his\napparent absorption in whatever his meditation projected or found.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\n\nNow, she decided, was the moment for her revelation; or rather, it\ncouldn't very well be further deferred, for it promised to be halting.\nBut, with her lips forming the words, he abruptly spoke:\n\n\"I have lived so long with your spirit, it has become so familiar--I\nmean the ability of completely making you out of my heart--that when you\nare here the difference isn't staggering. You see, you are never away.\nI have that ability; it came out of the other wreck. But you know about\nit--from years back. Time has only managed a greater power. Lately, and\nI have nothing to do with it, I have been seeing you again as a girl;\nas young as at Markue's party; younger. Not more than ten. I don't\nmean that there is anything--isn't the present fashionable word\nsubliminal?--esoteric. God forbid. You'll remember my hatred of that\nbrutal deception.\n\n\"No, it's only a part of my ability to create the shape of feeling, of\nSimon's hope. I see things as realities capable of exact statement; and,\nnaturally, more than all the rest, you come to me that way. But as a\nchild--who knows why?\" he relinquished the answer with an opened\npalm. \"And young like that, perhaps ten, I love you more sharply, more\nunutterably, than at any other age. What is it I love? Not your adorable\nplastic body, not that. It isn't necessary to understand.\n\n\"You have, as a child, a quality of blinding loveliness in a world I\nabsolutely distrust. An Elysian flower. Is it possible, do you suppose,\nto worship an abstract idea? It's not important to insist on my sanity.\"\n\nThe question of that had occurred independently to Linda; his hurried\nvoice and lost gaze filled her with apprehension. A dull reddish patch,\nshe saw, burned in either thin cheek; and she told herself that the\nfever had revived in him. Pleydon continued:\n\n\"Yet it is a timeless vision, because you never get old. I see Hallet\nfailing year by year, and your children, only yesterday dabs of soft\nflesh, grow up and pass through college and marry. I hear myself in the\nstudio with an old man's cough; the chisels slip under the mall and I\ncan't move the clay about without help--all fading, decaying, but you.\nCandles burn out, hundreds of them, while your whiteness, your flame--\n\n\"Strange, too, how you light a world, a sky, eternity. A word we have no\nbusiness with; a high-sounding word for a penny purpose. Look, we try\nto keep alive because it's necessary to life, to nature; and the effort,\nthe struggle, breeds the dream. You can understand that. Men who ought\nto know say that love is nothing more.\" He rose and stood over her,\ntowering and portentous against the curtained light. \"I don't pretend to\nguess. I'm a creative artist--Simon Downige at Cottarsport--I have you.\nIf it's God so much the better.\"\n\nWhat principally swept over Linda was the knowledge that his possession\nof her must keep them always apart. The reality, all realities, were\nveils to Pleydon. Her momentary vision of things beyond brick and earth\nwas magnified in him until everything else was obliterated. The fever!\nOh, yes, that and his passion for work merged in his passion for her.\nShe could bring him nothing; and she had a curious picture of two Lindas\nvisible to him here--the Linda that was actual and the other, the child.\nAnd of them it was the latter he cared most for, recreated out of his\ndesire to defraud his loneliness, to repay the damage to his spirit\nrealized in bronze.\n\nShe was, suddenly, too weary to stir or lift her hand; a depression\nas absolute as her flare of rage enveloped her. Now the reason for her\ncoming seemed inexplicable, as if, for the while, her mind had failed.\nShe repressed a shudder at the thought of being, through the long nights\nof his restlessness and wandering voice, alone with Pleydon. She hadn't,\nLinda discovered, any of the transmuting feeling for him which alone\nmade surrender possible. She calculated mentally how long it would take\nher to reach the station, what train would be available.\n\nLinda accepted dumbly the fatality to her own hope; for a few hours she\nhad thought it possible to break out of the prison of circumstance, to\nwalk free from all hindrance; but it had been vain. She gazed at Dodge\nPleydon intensely--a comprehensive view of the man she had so nearly\nmarried, and who, more than any other force, dominated her being. It was\nalready too late for anything but memory; she saw--filled with pity for\nthem both--hardly more than a strange old man with deadened hair and a\nyellow parchment-like skin. His suit of loose gray flannel gave her a\nfeeling that it had been borrowed from some one she lovingly knew. The\ngesture of his hand, too, had been copied from a brilliant personage\nwith a consuming impatience at all impotence.\n\n\"Remember me to Arnaud,\" he said, holding her gloves and the short fur\ncape. \"Wait!\" he cried sharply, turning to the bookcase against the\nwall. Pleydon fumbled in a box of lacquered gilt with a silk cord and\nproduced a glove once white but now brown and fragile with age. \"You\nnever missed it,\" he proceeded in a gleeful triumph; \"but then you had\nso many pairs. Once I sent you nine dozen together from Grenoble. They\nwere nothing, but this you had worn. For a long while it kept the shape\nof your hand.\"\n\n\"Dodge,\" she tried without success to steady her voice, \"it stayed with\nyou anyhow, my--my hand.\"\n\n\"But yes,\" he answered impatiently. He returned the glove to its box,\ncarefully tying the tasselled cord. Then, after clumsily helping her\nwith the cape, he accompanied her to the elevator. \"There were other\nthings,\" he told her. \"Did you see the letters about the Hesperia\naffair? Heaps of them. Rodin.... But what can you expect in a world\nwhere there is no safety--\" The stopping cage cut off his remark. She\nheld out the hand that was less real to him than the dream.\n\n\"Good-by, Dodge.\"\n\n\"Yes, Linda. But watch that door, your skirt might easily be caught in\nit.\" He fussed over her safety until, abruptly, he seemed to rise in\nspace, shut out from her by the limitations of her faith.\n\nThe evening overshadowed her in the train, as though she were whirling\nin the swiftest passage possible, through an indeterminate grayness,\nfrom day to night. The latter descended on her as she reached the steps\nof her home. It was still that; now it would continue to be until\ndeath. Nothing could ever again offer her change, release, vindication;\nnothing, that was, which might give her, for a day, what even her mother\nhad plentifully experienced--the igniting exultation of the body.\n\nIt was inevitable, she thought, for Arnaud to be in the library. He rose\nunsteadily as she stood in the doorway. \"Linda,\" he articulated with\ndifficulty. A book had rested open on the table beside him and, closing\nit, he put it back in its place. His arm trembled so that it took a\npainfully long while. Then he moved forward, still confused.\n\n\"What a confounded time you were gone. I had the most idiotic fancy. You\nsee, it was so unlike you; none more exact in habit. All day. I didn't\nget to the Historical Society, it seemed so devilish far off. I'd never\nblame you for leaving an old man without any gumption.\" He must never\nthink that again, she replied. Wasn't she, too, middle-aged?\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\n\nLinda admitted, definitely, the loss of her youth; and yet a stubborn\ninner conviction remained that she was unchanged. In this she had for\nsupport her appearance; practically she was as freshly and gracefully\npale as the girl who had married Arnaud Hallet. Even Vign\u00c3\u00a9, with\nindelible traces of her motherhood, had faint lines absent from Linda's\nflawless countenance. Her children, and Arnaud, were immensely proud of\nher beauty; it had become a part--in the form of her ridiculously young\nair--of the family conversational resources. She was increasingly aware\nof its supreme significance to her.\n\nOne of her few certainties had been the discovery that, while small\ntruths might be had from others, all that intimately and deeply\nconcerned her was beyond questioning and advice. The importance of her\nattractiveness, for example, which seemed the base of her entire being,\nwas completely out of accord with the accepted standard of values\nfor middle-aged women. Other things, called moral and spiritual, she\ninferred, should take up her days and thoughts. There was a course of\ndiscipline--exactly like exercises in the morning--for the preparation\nof the willingness to die.\n\nBut such an attitude was eternally beyond her; she repudiated it with\na revolt stringing every nerve indignantly tense. She had had, on the\nwhole, singularly little from life but her fine body; it had always been\nthe temple and altar of her service, and no mere wordy reassurance could\nnow repay her for its swift or gradual destruction. The latter, except\nfor accident, would be her fate; she was remarkably sound. In her social\nadventures, the balls to which, without Arnaud, she occasionally went,\nshe was morbid in her sensitive dread of discovering, through a waning\nadmiration, that she was faded.\n\nIt would be impossible to spend more care on her person than she had in\nthe past; but that was unrelenting. Linda was inexorable in her demands\non the establishments that made her suits and dresses. The slightest\nimperfection of fit exasperated her; and she regarded the endless change\nof fashions with contempt. This same shifting, she observed, occurred\nnot only in women's clothes but in the women themselves.\n\nLinda remembered her mother, eternal in gaiety, but very obviously\ndifferent from her in states of mind affecting her appearance. She was\nunable to define the change; but it was unmistakable--Stella Condon\nseemed a little old-fashioned. When now, to Lowrie's wife, Linda was\nunmistakably out-of-date. Lowrie, fast accomplishing all that had been\npredicted for him, had married a girl incomprehensible to his mother.\nObserving this later feminine development she had the baffled feeling of\ninspecting a creature of a new order.\n\nTo Linda, Jean Tynedale, now a Hallet, seemed harder than ever her own\nfamous coldness had succeeded in being. This came mostly from Jean's\nimposing education; there had been, in addition to the politest of\nfinishing schools, college--a woman's concern, Bryn Mawr--and then\npost-graduate honors in a noteworthy university. She was entirely\naddressed, in a concrete way, to the abstract problems of social\nprogress and hygiene; and, under thirty, the animating spirit, as well\nas financial support, of an incredible number of Settlements and allied\nundertakings. She spoke crisply before civic and other clubs; even, in\nthe interest of suffrage, addressing nondescript audiences from a box on\nthe street.\n\nBut it was her unperturbed dissection of the motives of sex, the\ndenouncement of a criminal mysterious ignorance, that most daunted\nLinda. She listened to Jean with a series of distinct shocks to her\nsense of propriety. What she had agreed to consider a nameless attribute\nof women, or, if anything more exact, the power of their charm over men,\nthe other defined in unequivocal scientific terms. She understood\nevery impulse veiled for Linda in a reticence absolutely needful to its\nappeal.\n\nThis, of course, the elder distrusted; just as she had no approval for\nJean's public activities. Linda didn't like public women; her every\ninstinct cried for a fine seclusion, fine in the meaning of an\nappropriate setting for feminine distinction, the magic of dress and cut\nroses. Her private inelegant word for Lowrie's wife was \"bold;\" indeed,\ndescribing to herself the younger woman's patronage of her bearing, she\ndescended to her mother's colloquialism \"brass.\"\n\nShe thought this sitting at a dinner-table which held Vign\u00c3\u00a9 and her\nhusband and Lowrie and Jean Hallet. Arnaud, drawing life from the\nvitality of an atmosphere charged with youth, was unflagging in splendid\nspirits and his valorous wit. Jean would never inspire the affection\nArnaud had given her; nor the passion that, in Pleydon, had burned unfed\neven by hope.\n\nHer thoughts slipped away from the present to the sculptor. Three years\nhad vanished since she had gone with an intention of finality to his\napartment, and in that time he had neither been in their house nor\nwritten. Linda had expected this; she was without the desire to see\nor hear from him. Dodge Pleydon was finished for her; as a man, a\npotentiality, he had departed from her life. He was a piece with her\nmemories, the triumphs of her young days. Without an actual knowledge of\nthe moment of its accomplishment she had passed over the border of that\nland, leaving it complete and fair and radiant for her lingering view.\nWhether or not she had been happy was now of no importance; the magic\nof its light showed only a garden and a girl in white with a black bang\nagainst her blue eyes.\n\nThe bang, the blueness of gaze, were still hers; but, only this\nmorning, brush in hand, the former had offered less resistance in its\narrangement; it was thinner, and the color perceptibly not so dense. At\nthis, with a chill edge of fear, she had determined to go at once to\nher hairdresser; no one, neither Arnaud, who loved its luster, nor an\nunsympathetic bold scrutiny, a scrutiny of brass, should see that she\nwas getting gray. There was no fault about her figure; she had that for\nher satisfaction; she was more graceful than Jean's square thinness,\nmore slim than Vign\u00c3\u00a9's maternal presence.\n\nLinda had the feeling that she was engaged in a struggle with time, a\nruthless antagonist whom she viewed with a personal enmity. Time must,\nwould, of course, triumph in the end; but there would be no sign of her\nsurrender in the meanwhile; she wouldn't bend an inch, relinquish by a\nfraction the pride and delicacy of her person. The skilful dyeing of\nher hair to its old absolute blackness, as natural and becoming in\nappearance as ever, was a symbol of her determination to cheat an\nintolerable tyranny.\n\nThe process, dismaying her soul, she bore with a rigid fortitude; as she\nendured the coldness of a morning bath from which, often, she was slow\nto react. This, to her, was widely different from the futile efforts\nof her mother, those women of the past, to preserve for practical ends\ntheir flushes of youth and exhilaration. She felt obscurely that she was\nserving a deeper reality created by the hands of Pleydon, Arnaud's\nfaith and pure pleasure, all that countless men had seen in her for\nadmiration, solace and power.\n\nBut it was inevitable, she told herself bitterly, that she should\nhear the first intimation of her decline from Jean Hallet. Rather, she\noverheard it, the discussion of her, from the loiterers at breakfast\nas she moved about the communicating library. Jean's emphatic slightly\nrough-textured voice arrested her in the arrangement of a bowl of\nzinnias:\n\n\"You can't say just where she has failed, but it's evident. Perhaps a\ngeneral dryness. Perfectly natural. Thoroughly silly to fight against\nit--\" Vign\u00c3\u00a9 interrupted her. \"I think mother's wonderful. I can't\nremember any other woman nearly her age who looks so enchanting in the\nevening.\"\n\nLinda quietly left the flowers as they were and went up to the room that\nhad been her father's. It was now used as a spare bedroom; and she had\nturned into it, in place of her own chamber, instinctively, without\nreason. She had kept it exactly as it had been when Amelia Lowrie first\nconducted her there, as it was when her father, a boy, slept under the\nwhite canopy.\n\nLinda advanced to the mirror; and, her hands so tightly clenched that\nthe finger-nails dug into the palms, forced herself to gaze steadily\nat the wavering reflection. It seemed to her that there had been a\nmalicious magic in Jean's detraction; for immediately, as though the\nharm had been wrought by the girl's voice, she saw that her clear\nfreshness had gone. Her face had a wax-like quality, the violet shadows\nunder her eyes were brown. Who had once called her a gardenia? Now she\nwas wilting--how many gardenias had she seen droop, turn brown. Her\nheart beat with a disturbing echo in her ears, and, with a slight gasp\nthat resembled a sob, she sank on one of the uncomfortable painted\nchairs.\n\nWhat, above every other sensation, oppressed her was a feeling of\nterrific loneliness--the familiar isolation magnified until it was past\nbearing. Yet, there was Arnaud, infallible in his tender comprehension,\nshe ought to go to him at once and find support. But it was impossible;\nall that he could give her was, to her special necessity, useless. She\nhad never been able to establish herself in his sympathy; the reason for\nthat lay in the fact that she could bring nothing similar in return.\n\nThe room--except for the timed clangor of the electric cars, like the\nmeasure of lost minutes--was quiet. The photograph of Bartram Hallet in\ncricketing clothes had faded until it was almost indistinguishable. Soon\nthe faint figure would disappear entirely, as though the picture were\namenable to the relentless principle operating in her.\n\nThe peace about her finally lessened her acute suffering, stilled her\nheart. She told herself with a show of vigor that she was a coward, a\ncharge that roused an unexpected activity of denial. She discovered that\ncowardice was intolerable to her. What had happened, too, was so far out\nof her hands that a trace of philosophical acceptance, recognition, came\nto her support. The loveliest woman alive must do the same, meet in a\nlooking-glass--that eternal accompanying sibyl--her disaster. She rose,\nher lips firmly set, composed and pale, and returned to the neglected\nflowers in the library.\n\nVign\u00c3\u00a9 entered and put an affectionate arm about her shoulders,\nrepeating--unconscious that Linda had heard the discussion which had\ngiven it being--the conviction that her mother was wonderful, specially\nin the black dinner dress with the girdle of jet. With no facility of\nexpression she gave her daughter's arm a quick light pressure.\n\nFrom then she watched the slow progress of age with a new realization,\nbut an unabated distaste and, wherever it was possible, a determined\nartifice. Arnaud had failed swiftly in the past months; and, while she\nwas inspecting the impaired supports of an arbor in the garden, he came\nto her with an unopened telegram. \"I abhor these things,\" he declared\nfretfully; \"they are so sudden. Why don't people write decent letters\nany more! It's like the telephone.... Good manners have been ruined.\"\n\nShe tore open the envelope, read the brief line within, and, a hand\nsuddenly put out to the arbor, sank on its bench. There had been rain,\nbut a late sun was again pouring over the sparkling grass, and robins\nwere singing with a lyrical clearness. \"What is it?\" Arnaud demanded\nanxiously, tremulous in the unsparing sunlight. She replied:\n\n\"Dodge died this morning.\"\n\nHis concern was as much for her as for Pleydon's death. \"I'm sorry,\nLinda,\" his hand was on her shoulder. \"It is a shock to you. A fine man,\na genius--none stronger in our day. When you were young and for so\nlong after.... I was lucky, Linda, to get you; have you all this while.\nNothing in Pleydon's life, not even his success, could have made up for\nyour loss.\"\n\nShe wondered dully if Dodge had missed her, if Arnaud Hallet had ever\nhad her in his possession. The robins filled the immaculate air\nwith song. It was impossible that Dodge, who was so imperious in his\ncertainty that he would never say good-by to her, was dead.\n\n\n\n\nXLI\n\n\nThere was a revival of public interest in the destruction of Pleydon's\nstatue at Hesperia, the papers again printed accounts colored by a\nvariety of attitudes unembarrassed by fact; and the serious journals\nunited in a dignity of eminently safe praise. At first Linda made an\neffort to preserve these; but soon their similarity, her inability to\nfind, among sonorous periods, any trace of Dodge's spirit--in reality\nshe knew so blindingly much more than the most penetrating critical\nintellect--caused her to leave the reviews unread. No one else living\nhad understood Pleydon; and when descriptions of his life spoke of the\nausterity in his later years, his fanatical aversion to women, Linda\nthought of the brittle glove in the gilt-lacquer box.\n\nHer own emotion, it seemed to her, was the most confused of all the\nunintelligible pressures that had converted her life into an enigma.\nShe had a distinct sense of overwhelming loss--of something, Linda was\nobliged to add, she had never owned. However, she realized that during\nPleydon's life she had dimly expected a happy accident of explanation;\nuntil almost the last, yes--after she had returned from that ultimate\njourney, she had been conscious of the presence of hope. The hope had\nbeen for herself, created out of her constant baffled dissatisfaction.\n\nBut now the man in whom solely she had been expressed, the only possible\nreason for her obstinate pride, had left her in a world that, but\nfor Arnaud's fondness, looked on her without remark. The loss of her\ndistinction had been finally evident at balls, in the dresses in which\nVign\u00c3\u00a9 had thought her so wonderful, and she dropped them. Here, she\nrepeated, was when affection, generously radiated through life, should\nhave reflected over her a tranquil and contented joy. She had never\ngiven it, and she was without the ability to receive. She admitted to\nherself, with a little annoyed laugh, that her old desire for inviolable\ncharm, for the integrity of a memorable slimness, was unimpaired. It\nwas, she thought, too ridiculously inappropriate for words.\n\nYet it had changed slightly into the recognition that what so often had\nbeen called her beauty was all she now had for sustenance, all she had\never had. Her mind returned continually to Pleydon, and--deep in the\nmystery of his passion--she was suddenly invaded by an insistent desire\nto see the monument at Cottarsport. She spoke to Arnaud at once about\nthis; and alone, through his delicacy of perception, Linda went to\nBoston the following day.\n\nThe further ride to Cottarsport followed the sea--a brilliant serene\nblue, fretted on the landward side by innumerable bare promontories,\nhideous towns and factories, but bowed in a far unbroken arc at the\nimmaculate horizon. She left the train for a hilly cluster of houses,\ngray and low like the rock everywhere apparent, dropping to a harbor\nthat bore a company of motionless boats with half-spread drying sails.\n\nThe day was at noon, and the sky, blue like the sea, held, still as the\nanchored schooners, faint, chalky symmetrical clouds. Linda found the\nCommon without guidance; and at once saw, on its immovable base of\nrugged granite, the bronze statue of Simon Downige. It stood well in\nadvance of what, evidently, was the court-house, the white steeple Dodge\nhad described. She found a bench by a path in the thin grass; and there,\nher gloved hands folded, at rest in her lap, her gaze and longing were\nlifted to the fixed aspiration.\n\nFrom where she sat the seated figure was projected against the sky;\nSimon's face was turned toward the west; the West that, for him, was the\nfuture, but which for Linda represented all the past. This conviction\nflooded her with unutterable sadness. A sense of failure weighed on her,\nno less heavy for the fact that it was perpetually vague. Her thoughts\ngathered about Dodge himself; and she recalled the curious vividness of\nhis vision of her as a child, perhaps ten. She, too, tried to remember\nthat time and age. It was almost in her grasp, but her realization was\nspoiled by absurd mental fragments--the familiar illusion of a leopard\nand a rider with bright hair, a forest with the ascending voices of\nangels, and an ominous squat figure with a slowly nodding plumed head.\n\nThe vista of a hotel returned, a fleet recollection of marble columns\nand a wide red carpet ... the white gleam and carbolized smell of a\ndrug-store ... a thick magazine in a brown cover. These, changed into\nemotions of mingled joy and pain, shifted in bright or dim colors and\nsensations. There was a slow heavy plodding of feet, now above her head,\nthe passage of a carried weight; and, in a flash of perception, she knew\nit was a coffin. She raised her clasped hands to her breast, crying into\nthe sunny silence, to the figure of Simon Downige lost in dream:\n\n\"He died that night, at the Boscombe, after he had told me about the\nmeadows with silk tents--\"\n\nHer memory, thrilling with the echoed miraculous chord of the child of\nten, sitting gravely, alone, among the shrill satins and caustic voices\nof a feminine throng, was complete. She saw herself, Linda Condon, as\nobjectively as Pleydon's described vision: there was a large bow on her\nstraight black hair, and, from under the bang, her gaze was clear and\nwondering. How marvelously young she was! The vindictive curiosity of\nthe questioning women, intent on their rings, brought out her eager\ndefense of her mother, the effort to explain away the ugly fact\nthat--that Mr. Jasper was married.\n\nShe saw Linda descending the marble stairs to the lower floor where\nthe games were kept in a somber corridor, and heard a voice halting her\nirresolute passage:\n\n\"Hello, Bellina.\"\n\nThat wasn't her name, and she corrected him, waiting afterward to listen\nto a strange fairy-like tale. The solitary, sick-looking man, with inky\nshadows under fixed eyes, was so actual that she recaptured the pungent\ndrift of his burning cigarette. He talked about love in a bitter\nintensity that hurt her. Yet, at first, he had said that she was lovely,\na touch of her ... forever in the memory. Mostly, however, he spoke of\na beautiful passion. It had largely vanished, his explanation continued;\nmen had come to worship other things. Plato started it.\n\nShe recalled Plato, as well, in connection with Dodge; now, it\nappeared to her, that remote name had always been at the back of her\nconsciousness. There were other names, other men, of an age long ago in\nItaly. Their ideal, religion, was contained in the adoration of a woman,\nbut not her body--it was a love of her spirit, the spirit their purity\nof need recognized, perhaps helped to create. It was a passion as\ndifferent as possible in essence from all she had observed about her. It\nwas useless for common purposes, withheld from Arnaud Hallet.\n\nThe man, seriously addressing the serious uncomprehending interest of\nten, proceeded with a description of violins--but she had heard them\nthrough all her life--and a parting that left only a white glove for\nremembrance. Then he had repeated that line, in Italian, which, not long\nback, her husband had recalled. The old gesture toward the stars, the\nneed to escape fatality--how she had suffered from that!\n\nYet it was a service of the body, a faith spiritual because, here, it\nwas never to be won, never to be realized in warm embrace. It had no\nrecognition in flesh, and it was the reward of no prayer or humility\nor righteousness. Only beauty knew and possessed it. His image grew dim\nlike the blurring of his voice by pain and the shadow of death. Linda's\nthoughts and longing turned again to Dodge; it seemed to her that he no\nmore than took up the recital where the other was silent.\n\nPleydon--was it at Markue's party or later?--talking about \"Homer's\nchildren\" had meant the creations of great artists, in sound or color or\nwords or form, through that supreme love unrealized in other life. The\nstatue of Simon Downige, towering before her against the sky and above\nthe sea, held in immutable bronze his conviction. The meager bundle and\ncrude stick rested by shoes clogged with mud; Simon's body was crushed\nwith weariness; but under the sweat-plastered brow his gaze pierced\nindomitable and undismayed to the vision of a place of truth.\n\nShe was choked by a sharp rush of joy at Dodge's accomplishment,\nan entire understanding of the beauty he had vainly explained, the\ndeathless communication of old splendid courage, an unshaken divine\nneed, to succeeding men and hope. This had been hers. She had always\nfelt her presence in his success; but, until now, it had belonged\nexclusively to him. Dodge had, in his love, absorbed her, and that\nresulted in the statues the world applauded. She, Linda thought, had\nbeen an element easily dismissed. It had hurt her pride almost beyond\nendurance, the pride that took the form of an inner necessity for the\nsurvival of her grace--all she had.\n\nShe had even asked him, in a passing resentment, why he had never\ndirectly modeled her, kept, with his recording genius, the shape of her\nfeatures. She had gone to him in a blinder vanity for the purpose of\nstamping her participation in his triumph on the stupid insensibility\nof their world. How incredible! But at last she could see that he had\npreserved her spirit, her secret self, from destruction. He had cheated\ndeath of her fineness. The delicate perfection of her youth would\nnever perish, never be dulled by old age or corrupted in death. It had\ninspired and entered into Pleydon's being, and he had lifted it on the\npedestal rising between the sea and sky.\n\nShe was in the Luxembourg, in that statue of Cotton Mather, the somber\nflame, about which he had written with a comment on the changing\nsubjects of his creations. From the moment when he sat beside her on\nthe divan in that room stifling with incense, with the naked glimmer of\nwomen's shoulders, she had been the source of his power. She had\nbeen his power. Linda smiled quietly, in retrospect, at her years of\nuncertainty, the feeling of waste, that had robbed her of peace. How\ncomplete her mystification had been! And, all the while, she had had\nthe thrill of delight, of premonition, born in her through the forgotten\nhour with the man who had died.\n\nThe sun, moving in celestial space, shifted the shadow about the base\nof Simon Downige's monument. The afternoon was advancing. She rose and\nturned, looking out over the sea to the horizon as brightly sharp as a\ncurved sword. The life of Cottarsport, below her, proceeded in detached\nfigures, an occasional unhurried passage. The boats in the harbor were\nslumberous. It was time to go. She gazed again, for a last view, at the\nbronze seated figure; and a word of Pleydon's, but rather it was Greek,\nwove its significance in the placid texture of her thoughts. Its exact\nshape evaded her, a difficult word to recall--_Katharsis_, the purging\nof the heart. About her was the beating of the white wings of a Victory\nsweeping her--a faded slender woman in immaculate gloves and a small\nmatchless hat--into a region without despair.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Linda Condon, by Joseph Hergesheimer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LINDA CONDON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7171-8.txt or 7171-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/7\/1\/7\/7171\/\n\nProduced by Anne Folland, Tiffany Vergon, Charles Franks\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":328,"split":"train"}
