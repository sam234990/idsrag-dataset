Six years later, Ralph (again the narrator), living on his father's inheritance on England's west coast and occupying himself as a naturalist, is visited by Peterkin, whose \"weather-beaten though ruddy countenance\" he does not recognize. Peterkin, who has stayed in touch with Jack, has hunted and killed every animal on Earth except for the gorilla and now comes to Ralph to entice him on a new adventure. After Peterkin writes him a letter, Jack joins the two, and they leave for Africa.\nThe three pick up a native guide and attend an elephant hunt. All kinds of animals are shot, killed, eaten, and stuffed, and the action is interspersed with sometimes serious, sometimes jocular conversation. Ralph theorizes at length on \"muffs\", which he defines as boys who are too gentle and mild, and should be made to undergo physically challenging training. Trading habits in this part of Africa are discussed: trade between the jungle and the coast is done via all the intermediary tribes, a cumbersome and expensive way of doing business. The trader who explains this to Ralph is a friend of missionary efforts: when the natives are ruled by their \"abominable superstitions\", they become \"incarnate fiends, and commit deeds of cruelty that make one's blood run cold to think of\". In addition, the trader argues that missionary work and trade should join to improve the fate of Africa: \"No good will ever be done in this land, to any great extent, until traders and missionaries go hand in hand into the interior, and the system of trade is entirely remodelled\".\nIn the village of King Jambai, the hunters are well received (boiled elephant foot is served and judged delicious), but problems arise when a young woman, betrothed to Makarooroo, their English-speaking guide, is judged by the village's \"fetishman\" to be responsible for an illness of the king's, and she is to die. The hunters help spring her from her jail, and in the melee that accompanies their escape two natives are killed: Jack trips one who falls to an accidental death in a pit, and Makarooroo kills another. They hide the woman a few days later with Mbango, the king of another tribe. Peterkin shoots an elephant, but a further hunting adventure goes badly for Jack, who went giraffe hunting by himself but is seriously injured by a rhinoceros. To recuperate the hunters spend a few weeks in the village of another tribe, ruled by a relative of King Jambai.\nThe plot for the second half of the book involves a slave trader, whom the three hunters and their guide pursue for weeks to prevent the trader and his gang from taking over and enslaving Mbango's people. They are too late, and Makarooroo's fiance is among the captured. When the trader attacks Jambai's village the three organize the defenses and successfully defeat the attackers. It is a relatively bloodless affair, since Jack has ensured that the first volley from Jambai's riflemen consists of wadded paper, intended to scare off the attackers without killing them. In addition, Peterkin dresses up in a colorful outfit and stands on top of a hill, screaming and setting off fireworks. However, when Ralph attacks the trader's camp, he manages to scare off the now-liberated slaves, and another weeks-long pursuit ends with the happy reunion of Makarooroo and his fiance, who head down to the (Christianized) coast to get married. After the three take receipt of their stuffed trophies, intended for British museums and schools, they head home, with Ralph and Peterkin saying farewell:\n\"Farewell,\" said I, as we leaned over the vessel's side and gazed sadly at the receding shore --- \"farewell to you, kind missionaries and faithful negro friends.\"\n\"Ay,\" added Peterkin, with a deep sigh, \"and fare-you-well, ye monstrous apes; gorillas, fare-you-well!\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gorilla Hunters, by R.M.

BALLANTYNE.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nIN WHICH THE HUNTERS ARE INTRODUCED.\n\nIt was five o'clock in the afternoon.  There can be no doubt whatever as\nto that.  Old Agnes may say what she pleases--she has a habit of doing\nso--but I know for certain (because I looked at my watch not ten minutes\nbefore it happened) that it was exactly five o'clock in the afternoon\nwhen I received a most singular and every way remarkable visit--a visit\nwhich has left an indelible impression on my memory, as well it might;\nfor, independent of its singularity and unexpectedness, one of its\nresults was the series of strange adventures which are faithfully\ndetailed in this volume.\n\nIt happened thus:--\n\nI was seated in an armchair in my private study in a small town on the\nwest coast of England.  It was a splendid afternoon, and it was exactly\nfive o'clock.  Mark that.  Not that there is anything singular about the\nmere fact, neither is it in any way mixed up with the thread of this\ntale; but old Agnes is very obstinate--singularly positive--and I have a\nspecial desire that she should see it in print, that I have not given in\non that point.  Yes, it was five precisely, and a beautiful evening.  I\nwas ruminating, as I frequently do, on the pleasant memories of bygone\ndays, especially the happy days that I spent long ago among the coral\nislands of the Pacific, when a tap at the door aroused me.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\n\"A veesiter, sir,\" said old Agnes (my landlady), \"an' he'll no gie his\nname.\"\n\nOld Agnes, I may remark, is a Scotchwoman.\n\n\"Show him in,\" said I.\n\n\"Maybe he's a pickpocket,\" suggested Agnes.\n\n\"I'll take my chance of that.\"\n\n\"Ay! that's like 'ee.  Cares for naethin'.  Losh, man, what if he cuts\nyer throat?\"\n\n\"I'll take my chance of that too; only _do_ show him in, my good woman,\"\nsaid I, with a gesture of impatience that caused the excellent (though\nobstinate) old creature to depart, grumbling.\n\nIn another moment a quick step was heard on the stair, and a stranger\nburst into the room, shut the door in my landlady's face as she followed\nhim, and locked it.\n\nI was naturally surprised, though not alarmed, by the abrupt and\neccentric conduct of my visitor, who did not condescend to take off his\nhat, but stood with his arms folded on his breast, gazing at me and\nbreathing hard.\n\n\"You are agitated, sir; pray be seated,\" said I, pointing to a chair.\n\nThe stranger, who was a little man and evidently a gentleman, made no\nreply, but, seizing a chair, placed it exactly before me, sat down on it\nas he would have seated himself on a horse, rested his arms on the back,\nand stared me in the face.\n\n\"You are disposed to be facetious,\" said I, smiling (for I never take\noffence without excessively good reason).\n\n\"Not at all, by no means,\" said he, taking off his hat and throwing it\nrecklessly on the floor.  \"You are Mr Rover, I presume?\"\n\n\"The same, sir, at your service.\"\n\n\"Are you? oh, that's yet to be seen!  Pray, is your Christian name\nRalph?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said I, in some surprise at the coolness of my visitor.\n\n\"Ah! just so.  Christian name Ralph, t'other name Rover--Ralph Rover.\nVery good.  Age twenty-two yesterday, eh?\"\n\n\"My birthday _was_ yesterday, and my age _is_ twenty-two.  You appear to\nknow more of my private history than I have the pleasure of knowing of\nyours.  Pray, sir, may I--but, bless me! are you unwell?\"\n\nI asked this in some alarm, because the little man was rolling about in\nhis seat, holding his sides, and growing very red in the face.\n\n\"Oh no! not at all; perfectly well--never was better in my life,\" he\nsaid, becoming all at once preternaturally grave.  \"You were once in the\nPacific--lived on a coral island--\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't trouble yourself to answer.  Just shut up for a minute or\ntwo.  You were rather a soft green youth then, and you don't seem to be\nmuch harder or less verdant now.\"\n\n\"Sir!\"  I exclaimed, getting angry.\n\n\"Just so,\" continued he, \"and you knew a young rascal there--\"\n\n\"I know a rascal _here_,\" I exclaimed, starting up, \"whom I'll kick--\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the little stranger, also starting up and capsizing the\nchair; \"Ralph Rover, has time and sunburning and war so changed my\nvisage that you cannot recognise Peterkin?\"\n\nI almost gasped for breath.\n\n\"Peterkin--Peterkin Gay!\"  I exclaimed.\n\nI am not prone to indulge in effeminate demonstration, but I am not\nashamed to confess that when I gazed on the weather-beaten though ruddy\ncountenance of my old companion, and observed the eager glance of his\nbright blue eyes, I was quite overcome, and rushed violently into his\narms.  I may also add that until that day I had had no idea of\nPeterkin's physical strength; for during the next five minutes he\ntwisted me about and spun me round and round my own room until my brain\nbegan to reel, and I was fain to cry him mercy.\n\n\"So, you're all right--the same jolly, young old wiseacre in whiskers\nand long coat,\" cried Peterkin.  \"Come now, Ralph, sit down if you can.\nI mean to stay with you all evening, and all night, and all to-morrow,\nand all next day, so we'll have lots of time to fight our battles o'er\nagain.  Meanwhile compose yourself, and I'll tell you what I've come\nabout.  Of course, my first and chief reason was to see your face, old\nboy; but I have another reason too--a very peculiar reason.  I've a\nproposal to make and a plan to unfold, both of 'em stunners; they'll\nshut you up and screw you down, and altogether flabbergast you when you\nhear 'em, so sit down and keep quiet--do.\"\n\nI sat down accordingly, and tried to compose myself; but, to say truth,\nI was so much overjoyed and excited by the sight of my old friend and\ncompanion that I had some difficulty at first in fixing my attention on\nwhat he said, the more especially that he spoke with extreme volubility,\nand interrupted his discourse very frequently, in order to ask questions\nor to explain.\n\n\"Now, old fellow,\" he began, \"here goes, and mind you don't interrupt\nme.  Well, I mean to go, and I mean you to go with me, to--but, I\nforgot, perhaps you won't be able to go.  What are you?\"\n\n\"What am I?\"\n\n\"Ay, your profession, your calling; lawyer, M.D., scrivener--which?\"\n\n\"I am a naturalist.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A naturalist.\"\n\n\"Ralph,\" said Peterkin slowly, \"have you been long troubled with that\ncomplaint?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, laughing; \"I have suffered from it from my earliest\ninfancy, more or less.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" rejoined my companion, shaking his head gravely.  \"I\nfancied that I observed the development of that disease when we lived\ntogether on the coral island.  It don't bring you in many thousands a\nyear, does it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, \"it does not.  I am only an amateur, having a sufficiency\nof this world's goods to live on without working for my bread.  But\nalthough my dear father at his death left me a small fortune, which\nyields me three hundred a year, I do not feel entitled to lead the life\nof an idler in this busy world, where so many are obliged to toil night\nand day for the bare necessaries of life.  I have therefore taken to my\nfavourite studies as a sort of business, and flatter myself that I have\nmade one or two not unimportant discoveries, and added a few mites to\nthe sum of human knowledge.  A good deal of my time is spent in\nscientific roving expeditions throughout the country, and in\ncontributing papers to several magazines.\"\n\nWhile I was thus speaking I observed that Peterkin's face was undergoing\nthe most remarkable series of changes of expression, which, as I\nconcluded, merged into a smile of beaming delight, as he said,--\"Ralph,\nyou're a trump!\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said I, \"you are right; but, setting that question aside for\nthe present, let me remind you that you have not yet told me where you\nmean to go to.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Peterkin slowly, placing both hands on his knees and\nlooking me steadily in the face--\"I mean to go a-hunting in--but I\nforgot.  You don't know that I'm a hunter, a somewhat famous hunter?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't.  You are so full of your plans and proposals that\nyou have not yet told me where you have been or what doing these six\nyears.  And you ye never written to me once all that time, shabby\nfellow.  I thought you were dead.\"\n\n\"Did you go into mourning for me, Ralph?\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\"\n\n\"A pretty fellow you are to find fault.  You thought that I, your oldest\nand best friend, was dead, and you did not go into mourning.  How could\nI write to you when you parted from me without giving me your address?\nIt was a mere chance my finding you out even now.  I was taking a quiet\ncup of coffee in the commercial room of a hotel not far distant, when I\noverheard a stranger speaking of his friend `Ralph Rover, the\nphilosopher,' so I plunged at him promiscuously, and made him give me\nyour address.  But I've corresponded with Jack ever since we parted on\nthe pier at Dover.\"\n\n\"What!  Jack--Jack Martin?\"  I exclaimed, as a warm gush of feeling\nfilled my heart at the sound of his well-remembered name.  \"Is Jack\nalive?\"\n\n\"Alive!  I should think so.  If possible, he's more alive than ever; for\nI should suppose he must be full-grown now, which he was not when we\nlast met.  He and I have corresponded regularly.  He lives in the north\nof England, and by good luck happens to be just now within thirty miles\nof this town.  You don't mean to say, Ralph, that you have never met!\"\n\n\"Never.  The very same mistake that happened with you occurred between\nhim and me.  We parted vowing to correspond as long as we should live,\nand three hours after I remembered that we had neglected to exchange our\naddresses, so that we could not correspond.  I have often, often made\ninquiries both for you and him, but have always failed.  I never heard\nof Jack from the time we parted at Dover till to-day.\"\n\n\"Then no doubt you thought us both dead, and yet you did not go into\nmourning for either of us!  O Ralph, Ralph, I had entertained too good\nan opinion of you.\"\n\n\"But tell me about Jack,\" said I, impatient to hear more concerning my\ndear old comrade.\n\n\"Not just now, my boy; more of him in a few minutes.  First let us\nreturn to the point.  What was it?  Oh! a--about my being a celebrated\nhunter.  A very Nimrod--at least a miniature copy.  Well, Ralph, since\nwe last met I have been all over the world, right round and round it.\nI'm a lieutenant in the navy now--at least I was a week ago.  I've been\nfighting with the Kaffirs and the Chinamen, and been punishing the\nrascally sepoys in India, and been hunting elephants in Ceylon and\ntiger-shooting in the jungles, and harpooning whales in the polar seas,\nand shooting lions at the Cape; oh, you've no notion where all I've\nbeen.  It's a perfect marvel I've turned up here alive.  But there's one\nbeast I've not yet seen, and I'm resolved to see him and shoot him\ntoo--\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, interrupting, \"what mean you by saying that you were a\nlieutenant in the navy a week ago?\"\n\n\"I mean that I've given it up.  I'm tired of the sea.  I only value it\nas a means of getting from one country to another.  The land, the land\nfor me!  You must know that an old uncle, a rich old uncle of mine, whom\nI never saw, died lately and left me his whole fortune.  Of course he\ndied in India.  All old uncles who die suddenly and leave unexpected\nfortunes to unsuspecting nephews are old Indian uncles, and mine was no\nexception to the general rule.  So I'm independent, like you, Ralph,\nonly I've got three or four thousand a year instead of hundreds, I\nbelieve; but I'm not sure and don't care--and I'm determined now to go\non a long hunting expedition.  What think ye of all that, my boy?\"\n\n\"In truth,\" said I, \"it would puzzle me to say what I think, I am so\nfilled with surprise by all you tell me.  But you forget that you have\nnot yet told me to which part of the world you mean to go, and what sort\nof beast it is you are so determined to see and shoot if you can.\"\n\n\"If I can!\" echoed Peterkin, with a contemptuous curl of the lip.  \"Did\nnot I tell you that I was a _celebrated_ hunter?  Without meaning to\nboast, I may tell you that there is no peradventure in my shooting.  If\nI only get there and see the brute within long range, I'll--ha! won't\nI!\"\n\n\"Get _where_, and see _what_?\"\n\n\"Get to Africa and see the gorilla!\" cried Peterkin, while a glow of\nenthusiasm lighted up his eyes.  \"You've heard of the gorilla, Ralph, of\ncourse--the great ape--the enormous puggy--the huge baboon--the man\nmonkey, that we've been hearing so much of for some years back, and that\nthe niggers on the African coast used to dilate about till they caused\nthe very hair of my head to stand upon end?  I'm determined to shoot a\ngorilla, or prove him to be a myth.  And I mean you to come and help me,\nRalph; he's quite in your way.  A bit of natural history, I suppose,\nalthough he seems by all accounts to be a very unnatural monster.  And\nJack shall go too--I'm resolved on that; and we three shall roam the\nwild woods again, as we did in days of yore, and--\"\n\n\"Hold, Peterkin,\" said I, interrupting.  \"How do you know that Jack will\ngo?\"\n\n\"How do I know?  Intuitively, of course.  I shall write to him to-night;\nthe post does not leave till ten.  He'll get it to-morrow at breakfast,\nand will catch the forenoon coach, which will bring him down here by two\no'clock, and then we'll begin our preparations at once, and talk the\nmatter over at dinner.  So you see it's all cut and dry.  Give me a\nsheet of paper and I'll write at once.  Ah! here's a bit; now a pen.\nBless me, Ralph, haven't you got a quill?  Who ever heard of a\nphilosophical naturalist writing with steel.  Now, then, here\ngoes:--`B'luv'd Jack,'--will that do to begin with, eh?  I'm afraid it's\ntoo affectionate; he'll think it's from a lady friend.  But it can't be\naltered,--`Here I am, and here's Ralph--Ralph Rover!!!!!! think of\nthat,' (I say, Ralph, I've put six marks of admiration there); `I've\nfound him out.  Do come to see us.  Excruciatingly important business.\nEver thine--Peterkin Gay.'  Will that bring him, d'ye think?\"\n\n\"I think it will,\" said I, laughing.\n\n\"Then off with it, Ralph,\" cried my volatile friend, jumping up and\nlooking hastily round for the bell-rope.  Not being able to find it, my\nbell-pull being an unobtrusive knob and not a rope, he rushed to the\ndoor, unlocked it, darted out, and uttered a tremendous roar, which was\nfollowed by a clatter and a scream from old Agnes, whom he had upset and\ntumbled over.\n\nIt was curious to note the sudden change that took place in Peterkin's\nface, voice, and manner, as he lifted the poor old woman, who was very\nthin and light, in his arms, and carrying her into the room, placed her\nin my easy-chair.  Real anxiety was depicted in his countenance, and he\nset her down with a degree of care and tenderness that quite amazed me.\nI was myself very much alarmed at first.\n\n\"My poor dear old _woman_,\" said Peterkin, supporting my landlady's\nhead; \"my stupid haste I fear you are hurt.\"\n\n\"Hech! it's nae hurt--it's deed I am, fair deed; killed be a\nwhaumlskamerin' young blagyird.  Oh, ma puir heed!\"\n\nThe manner and tone in which this was said convinced me that old Agnes\nwas more frightened than injured.  In a few minutes the soothing tones\nand kind manner of my friend had such an effect upon her that she\ndeclared she was better, and believed after all that she was only a \"wee\nbit frichtened.\"  Nay, so completely was she conciliated, that she\ninsisted on conveying the note to the post-office, despite Peterkin's\nassurance that he would not hear of it.  Finally she hobbled out of the\nroom with the letter in her hand.\n\nIt is interesting to note how that, in most of the affairs of humanity,\nthings turn out very different, often totally different, from what we\nhad expected or imagined.  During the remainder of that evening Peterkin\nand I talked frequently and much of our old friend Jack Martin.  We\nrecalled his manly yet youthful countenance, his bold, lion-like\ncourage, his broad shoulders and winning gentle smile, and although we\nknew that six years must have made an immense difference in his personal\nappearance--for he was not much more than eighteen when we last parted--\nwe could not think of him except as a hearty, strapping sailor-boy.  We\nplanned, too, how we would meet him at the coach; how we would stand\naside in the crowd until he began to look about for us in surprise, and\nthen one of us would step forward and ask if he wished to be directed to\nany particular part of the town, and so lead him on and talk to him as a\nstranger for some time before revealing who we were.  And much more to\nthe same effect.  But when next day came our plans and our conceptions\nwere utterly upset.\n\nA little before two we sauntered down to the coach-office, and waited\nimpatiently for nearly twenty minutes.  Of course the coach was late; it\nalways is on such occasions.\n\n\"Suppose he does not come,\" said I.\n\n\"What a fellow you are,\" cried Peterkin, \"to make uncomfortable\nsuppositions!  Let us rather suppose that he does come.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, it would be all right; but if he does not come, what then?\"\n\n\"Why, then, it would be all wrong, and we should have to return home and\neat our dinner in the sulks, that's all.\"\n\nAs my companion spoke we observed the coach come sweeping round the turn\nof the road about half a mile distant.  In a few seconds it dashed into\nthe town at full gallop, and finally drew up abruptly opposite the door\nof the inn, where were assembled the usual group of hostlers and waiters\nand people who expected friends by the coach.\n\n\"He's not there,\" whispered Peterkin, in deep disappointment--\"at least\nhe's not on the outside, and Jack would never travel inside of a coach\neven in bad weather, much less in fine.  That's not him on the back-seat\nbeside the fat old woman with the blue bundle, surely!  It's very like\nhim, but too young, much too young.  There's a great giant of a man on\nthe box-seat with a beard like a grenadier's shako, and a stout old\ngentleman behind him with gold spectacles.  That's all, except two boys\nfarther aft, and three ladies in the cabin.  Oh, _what_ a bore!\"\n\nAlthough deeply disappointed at the non-arrival of Jack, I could with\ndifficulty refrain from smiling at the rueful and woe-begone countenance\nof my poor companion.  It was evident that he could not bear\ndisappointment with equanimity, and I was on the point of offering some\nconsolatory remarks, when my attention was attracted by the little old\nwoman with the blue bundle, who went up to the gigantic man with the\nblack beard, and in the gentlest possible tone of voice asked if he\ncould direct her to the white house.\n\n\"No, madam,\" replied the big man hastily; \"I'm a stranger here.\"\n\nThe little old woman was startled by his abrupt answer.  \"Deary me, sir,\nno offence, I hope.\"\n\nShe then turned to Peterkin and put the same question, possibly under a\nvague sort of impression that if a gigantic frame betokened a gruff\nnature, diminutive stature must necessarily imply extreme amiability.\nIf so, she must have been much surprised as well as disappointed, for\nPeterkin, rendered irascible by disappointment, turned short round and\nsaid sharply, \"Why, madam, how can _I_ tell you where the white house\nis, unless you say which white house you want?  Half the houses of the\ntown are white--at least they're _dirty_ white,\" he added bitterly, as\nhe turned away.\n\n\"I think I can direct you, ma'am,\" said I, stepping quickly up with a\nbland smile, in order to counteract, if possible, my companion's\nrudeness.\n\n\"Thank you, sir, kindly,\" said the little old woman; \"I'm glad to find\n_some_ little civility in the town.\"\n\n\"Come with me, ma'am; I am going past the white house, and will show you\nthe way.\"\n\n\"And pray, sir,\" said the big stranger, stepping up to me as I was about\nto move away, \"can you recommend me to a good hotel?\"\n\nI replied that I could; that there was one in the immediate vicinity of\nthe white house, and that if he would accompany me I would show him the\nway.  All this I did purposely in a very affable and obliging tone and\nmanner; for I hold that example is infinitely better than precept, and\nalways endeavour, if possible, to overcome evil with good.  I offered my\narm to the old woman, who thanked me and took it.\n\n\"What!\" whispered Peterkin, \"you don't mean me to take this great ugly\ngorilla in tow?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied I, laughing, as I led the way.\n\nImmediately I entered into conversation with my companion, and I heard\n\"the gorilla\" attempt to do so with Peterkin; but from the few sharp\ncross replies that reached my ear, I became aware that he was\nunsuccessful.  In the course of a few minutes, however, he appeared to\nhave overcome his companion's ill-humour, for I overheard their voices\ngrowing louder and more animated as they walked behind me.\n\nSuddenly I heard a shout, and turning hastily round, observed Peterkin\nstruggling in the arms of the gorilla!  Amazed beyond measure at the\nsight, and firmly persuaded that a cowardly assault had been made upon\nmy friend, I seized the old woman's umbrella, as the only available\nweapon, and flew to the rescue.\n\n\"Jack, my boy! can it be possible?\" gasped Peterkin.\n\n\"I believe it is,\" replied Jack, laughing.--\"Ralph, my dear old fellow,\nhow are you?\"\n\nI stood petrified.  I believed that I was in a dream.\n\nI know not what occurred during the next five minutes.  All I could\nremember with anything like distinctness was a succession of violent\nscreams from the little old woman, who fled shouting thieves and murder\nat the full pitch of her voice.  We never saw that old woman again, but\nI made a point of returning her umbrella to the \"white house.\"\n\nGradually we became collected and sane.\n\n\"Why, Jack, how did you find us out?\" cried Peterkin, as we all hurried\non to my lodgings, totally forgetful of the little old woman, whom, as I\nhave said, we never saw again, but who, I sincerely trust, arrived at\nthe white house in safety.\n\n\"Find you out!  I knew you the moment I set eyes on you.  Ralph puzzled\nme for a second, he has grown so much stouter; but I should know your\nnose, Peterkin, at a mile off.\"\n\n\"Well, Jack, I did not know you,\" retorted Peterkin, \"but I'm safe never\nagain to forget you.  Such a great hairy Cossack as you have become!\nWhy, what do you mean by it?\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it, please,\" pleaded Jack; \"I grew in spite of myself;\nbut I think I've stopped now.\"\n\n\"It's time,\" remarked Peterkin.\n\nJack had indeed grown to a size that men seldom attain to without losing\nin grace infinitely more than they gain in bulk, but he had retained all\nthe elegance of form and sturdy vigour of action that had characterised\nhim as a boy.  He was fully six feet two inches in his stockings, but so\nperfect were his proportions that his great height did not become\napparent until you came close up to him.  Full half of his handsome\nmanly face was hid by a bushy black beard and moustache, and his curly\nhair had been allowed to grow luxuriantly, so that his whole aspect was\nmore like to the descriptions we have of one of the old Scandinavian\nVikings than a gentleman of the present time.  In whatever company he\nchanced to be he towered high above every one else, and I am satisfied\nthat, had he walked down Whitechapel, the Horse Guards would have\nappeared small beside him, for he possessed not only great length of\nlimb but immense breadth of chest and shoulders.\n\nDuring our walk to my lodgings Peterkin hurriedly stated his \"plan and\nproposal,\" which caused Jack to laugh very much at first, but in a few\nminutes he became grave, and said slowly, \"That will just suit--it will\ndo exactly.\"\n\n\"What will do exactly?  Do be more explicit, man,\" said Peterkin, with\nsome impatience.\n\n\"I'll go with you, my boy.\"\n\n\"Will you?\" cried Peterkin, seizing his hand and shaking it violently;\n\"I knew you would.  I said it; didn't I, Ralph?  And now we shall be\nsure of a gorilla, if there's one in Africa, for I'll use you as a\nstalking-horse.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"Yes; I'll put a bear-skin or some sort of fur on your shoulders, and\ntie a lady's boa to you for a tail, and send you into the woods.  The\ngorillas will be sure to mistake you for a relative until you get quite\nclose; then you'll take one pace to the left with the left foot (as the\nvolunteers say), I'll take one to the front with the right--at fifty\nyards, ready--present--bang, and down goes the huge puggy with a bullet\nright between its two eyes!  There.  And Ralph's agreed to go too.\"\n\n\"O Peterkin, I've done nothing of the sort.  You _proposed_ it.\"\n\n\"Well, and isn't that the same thing?  I wonder, Ralph that you can give\nway to such mean-spirited prevarication.  What?  `It's not\nprevarication!'  Don't say that now; you know it is.  Ah! you may laugh,\nmy boy, but you have promised to go with me and Jack to Africa, and go\nyou shall.\"\n\nAnd so, reader, it was ultimately settled, and in the course of two\nweeks more we three were on our way to the land of the slave, the black\nsavage, and the gorilla.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nLIFE IN THE WILD WOODS.\n\nOne night, about five or six weeks after our resolution to go to Africa\non a hunting expedition was formed, I put to myself the question, \"Can\nit be possible that we are actually here, in the midst of it?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my boy, in the very thick of it,\" answered Peterkin, in a\ntone of voice which made Jack laugh, while I started and exclaimed--\n\n\"Why, Peterkin, how did you come to guess my thoughts?\"\n\n\"Because, Ralph, you have got into a habit of thinking aloud, which may\ndo very well as long as you have no secrets to keep but it may prove\ninconvenient some day, so I warn you in time.\"\n\nNot feeling disposed at that time to enter into a bantering conversation\nwith my volatile companion, I made no reply, but abandoned myself again\nto the pleasing fancies and feelings which were called up by the\nsingular scene in the midst of which I found myself.\n\nIt seemed as if it were but yesterday when we drove about the crowded\nstreets of London making the necessary purchases for our intended\njourney, and now, as I gazed around, every object that met my eye seemed\nstrange, and wild, and foreign, and romantic.  We three were reclining\nround an enormous wood fire in the midst of a great forest, the trees\nand plants of which were quite new to me, and totally unlike those of my\nnative land.  Rich luxuriance of vegetation was the feature that filled\nmy mind most.  Tall palms surrounded us, throwing their broad leaves\noverhead and partially concealing the starlit sky.  Thick tough limbs of\ncreeping plants and wild vines twisted and twined round everything and\nover everything, giving to the woods an appearance of tangled\nimpenetrability; but the beautiful leaves of some, and the delicate\ntendrils of others, half concealed the sturdy limbs of the trees, and\nthrew over the whole a certain air of wild grace, as might a\nsemi-transparent and beautiful robe if thrown around the form of a\nsavage.\n\nThe effect of a strong fire in the woods at night is to give to\nsurrounding space an appearance of ebony blackness, against which dark\nground the gnarled stems and branches and pendent foliage appear as if\ntraced out in light and lovely colours, which are suffused with a rich\nwarm tone from the blaze.\n\nWe were now in the wilds of Africa, although, as I have said, I found it\ndifficult to believe the fact.  Jack and I wore loose brown shooting\ncoats and pantaloons; but we had made up our minds to give up waistcoats\nand neckcloths, so that our scarlet flannel shirts with turned-down\ncollars gave to us quite a picturesque and brigand-like appearance as we\nencircled the blaze--Peterkin smoking vigorously, for he had acquired\nthat bad and very absurd habit at sea.  Jack smoked too, but he was not\nso inveterate as Peterkin.\n\nJack was essentially moderate in his nature.  He did nothing violently\nor in a hurry; but this does not imply that he was slow or lazy.  He was\nleisurely in disposition, and circumstances seldom required him to be\notherwise.  When Peterkin or I had to lift heavy weights, we were\nobliged to exert our utmost strength and agitate our whole frames; but\nJack was so powerful that a comparatively slight effort was all that he\nwas usually obliged to make.  Again, when we two were in a hurry we\nwalked quickly, but Jack's long limbs enabled him to keep up with us\nwithout effort.  Nevertheless there were times when he was called upon\nto act quickly and with energy.  On those occasions he was as active as\nPeterkin himself, but his movements were tremendous.  It was, I may\nalmost say, awful to behold Jack when acting under powerful excitement.\nHe was indeed a splendid fellow, and not by any means deserving of the\nname of gorilla, which Peterkin had bestowed on him.\n\nBut to continue my description of our costume.  We all wore homespun\ngrey trousers of strong material.  Peterkin and Jack wore leggings in\naddition, so that they seemed to have on what are now termed\nknickerbockers.  Peterkin, however, had no coat.  He preferred a stout\ngrey flannel shirt hanging down to his knees and belted round his waist\nin the form of a tunic.  Our tastes in headdress were varied.  Jack wore\na pork-pie cap; Peterkin and I had wide-awakes.  My facetious little\ncompanion said that I had selected this species of hat because I was\nalways more than half asleep!  Being peculiar in everything, Peterkin\nwore his wide-awake in an unusual manner--namely, turned up at the back,\ndown at the front, and curled very much up at the sides.\n\nWe were so filled with admiration of Jack's magnificent beard and\nmoustache, that Peterkin and I had resolved to cultivate ours while in\nAfrica; but I must say that, as I looked at Peterkin's face, the\nadditional hair was not at that time an improvement, and I believe that\nmuch more could not have been said for myself.  The effect on my little\ncomrade was to cause the lower part of his otherwise good-looking face\nto appear extremely dirty.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Peterkin, after a long silence, \"if we shall reach the\nniggers' village in time for the hunt to-morrow.  I fear that we have\nspent too much time in this wild-goose chase.\"\n\n\"Wild-goose chase, Peterkin!\"  I exclaimed.  \"Do you call hunting the\ngorilla by such a term?\"\n\n\"_Hunting_ the gorilla? no, certainly; but _looking_ for the gorilla in\na part of the woods where no such beast was ever heard of since Adam was\na schoolboy--\"\n\n\"Nay, Peterkin,\" interrupted Jack; \"we are getting very near to the\ngorilla country, and you must make allowance for the enthusiasm of a\nnaturalist.\"\n\n\"Ah! we shall see where the naturalist's enthusiasm will fly to when we\nactually do come face to face with the big puggy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, apologetically, \"I won't press you to go hunting again;\nI'll be content to follow.\"\n\n\"Press me, my dear Ralph!\" exclaimed Peterkin hastily, fearing that he\nhad hurt my feelings; \"why, man, I do but jest with you--you are so\nhorridly literal.  I'm overjoyed to be pressed to go on the maddest\nwild-goose chase that ever was invented.  My greatest delight would be\nto go gorilla-hunting down Fleet Street, if you were so disposed.--But\nto be serious, Jack, do you think we shall be in time for the\nelephant-hunt to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Ay, in capital time, if you don't knock up.\"\n\n\"What!  _I_ knock up!  I've a good mind to knock you down for suggesting\nsuch an egregious impossibility.\"\n\n\"That's an impossibility anyhow, Peterkin, because I'm down already,\"\nsaid Jack, yawning lazily and stretching out his limbs in a more\ncomfortable and _degage_ manner.\n\nPeterkin seemed to ponder as he smoked his pipe for some time in\nsilence.\n\n\"Ralph,\" said he, looking up suddenly, \"I don't feel a bit sleepy, and\nyet I'm tired enough.\"\n\n\"You are smoking too much, perhaps,\" I suggested.\n\n\"It's not that,\" cried Jack; \"he has eaten too much supper.\"\n\n\"Base insinuation!\" retorted Peterkin.\n\n\"Then it must be the monkey.  That's it.  Roast monkey does not agree\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Do you know, I shouldn't wonder if you were right; and it's a pity,\ntoo, for we shall have to live a good deal on such fare, I believe.\nHowever, I suppose we shall get used to it.--But I say, boys, isn't it\njolly to be out here living like savages?  I declare it seems to me like\na dream or a romance.--Just look, Ralph, at the strange wild creepers\nthat are festooned overhead, and the great tropical leaves behind us,\nand the clear sky above, with the moon--ah! the moon; yes, that's one\ncomfort--the moon is unchanged.  The same moon that smiles down upon us\nthrough a tangled mesh-work of palm-leaves and wild vines and monkeys'\ntails, is peeping down the chimney-pots of London and Edinburgh and\nDublin!\"\n\n\"Why, Peterkin, you must have studied hard in early life to be so good a\ngeographer.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" observed Peterkin.\n\n\"Yes; and look at the strange character of the tree-stems,\" said I,\nunwilling to allow the subject to drop.  \"See those huge palmettoes\nlike--like--\"\n\n\"Overgrown cabbages,\" suggested Peterkin; and he continued, \"Observe the\nquaint originality of form in the body and limbs of that bloated old\nspider that is crawling up your leg, Ralph!\"\n\nI started involuntarily, for there is no creature of which I have a\ngreater abhorrence than a spider.\n\n\"Where is it? oh!  I see,\" and the next moment I secured my prize and\nplaced it with loathing, but interest, in my entomological box.\n\nAt that moment a hideous roar rang through the woods, seemingly close\nbehind us.  We all started to our feet, and seizing our rifles, which\nlay beside us ready loaded, cocked them and drew close together round\nthe fire.\n\n\"This won't do, lads,\" said Jack, after a few minutes' breathless\nsuspense, during which the only sound we could hear was the beating of\nour own hearts; \"we have allowed the fire to get too low, and we've\nforgotten to adopt our friend the trader's advice, and make two fires.\"\n\nSo saying, Jack laid down his rifle, and kicking the logs with his heavy\nboot, sent up such a cloud of bright sparks as must certainly have\nscared the wild animal, whatever it was, away; for we heard no more of\nit that night.\n\n\"You're right, Jack,\" remarked Peterkin; \"so let us get up a blaze as\nfast as we can, and I'll take the first watch, not being sleepy.  Come\nalong.\"\n\nIn a few minutes we cut down with our axes a sufficient quantity of dry\nwood to keep two large fires going all night; we then kindled our second\nfire at a few yards distant from the first, and made our camp between\nthem.  This precaution we took in order to scare away the wild animals\nwhose cries we heard occasionally during the night.  Peterkin, having\nproposed to take the first watch--for we had to watch by turns all the\nnight through--lighted his pipe and sat down before the cheerful fire\nwith his back against the stem of a palm-tree, and his rifle lying close\nto his hand, to be ready in case of a surprise.  There were many natives\nwandering about in that neighbourhood, some of whom might be ignorant of\nour having arrived at their village on a peaceful errand.  If these\nshould have chanced to come upon us suddenly, there was no saying what\nthey might do in their surprise and alarm, so it behoved us to be on our\nguard.\n\nJack and I unrolled the light blankets that we carried strapped to our\nshoulders through the day, and laying ourselves down side by side with\nour feet to the fire and our heads pillowed on a soft pile of\nsweet-scented grass, we addressed ourselves to sleep.  But sleep did not\ncome so soon as we expected.  I have often noted with some surprise and\nmuch interest the curious phases of the phenomenon of sleep.  When I\nhave gone to bed excessively fatigued and expecting to fall asleep\nalmost at once, I have been surprised and annoyed to find that the\nlonger I wooed the drowsy god the longer he refused to come to me; and\nat last, when I have given up the attempt in despair, he has suddenly\nlaid his gentle hand upon my eyes and carried me into the land of Nod.\nAgain, when I have been exceedingly anxious to keep awake, I have been\nattacked by sleep with such irresistible energy that I have been utterly\nunable to keep my eyelids open or my head erect, and have sat with my\neyes blinking like those of an owl in the sunshine, and my head nodding\nlike that of a Chinese mandarin.\n\nOn this our first night in the African bush, at least our first night on\na hunting expedition--we had been many nights in the woods on our\njourney to that spot--on this night, I say, Jack and I could by no means\nget to sleep for a very long time after we lay down, but continued to\ngaze up through the leafy screen overhead at the stars, which seemed to\nwink at us, I almost fancied, jocosely.  We did not speak to each other,\nbut purposely kept silence.  After a time, however, Jack groaned, and\nsaid softly--\n\n\"Ralph, are you asleep?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, yawning.\n\n\"I'm quite sure that Peterkin is,\" added Jack, raising his head and\nlooking across the fire at the half-recumbent form of our companion.\n\n\"Is he?\" said Peterkin in a low tone.  \"Just about as sound as a\nweasel!\"\n\n\"Jack,\" said I.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep a wink.  Ye-a-ow! isn't it odd?\"\n\n\"No more can I.  Do you know, Ralph, I've been counting the red berries\nin that tree above me for half an hour, in the hope that the monotony of\nthe thing would send me off; but I was interrupted by a small monkey who\nhas been sitting up among the branches and making faces at me for full\ntwenty minutes.  There it is yet, I believe.  Do you see it?\"\n\n\"No; where?\"\n\n\"Almost above your head.\"\n\nI gazed upward intently for a few minutes, until I thought I saw the\nmonkey, but it was very indistinct.  Gradually, however, it became more\ndefined; then to my surprise it turned out to be the head of an\nelephant!  I was not only amazed but startled at this.\n\n\"Get your rifle, Jack!\" said I, in a low whisper.\n\nJack made some sort of reply, but his voice sounded hollow and\nindistinct.  Then I looked up again, and saw that it was the head of a\nhippopotamus, not that of an elephant, which was looking down at me.\nCuriously enough, I felt little or no surprise at this, and when in the\ncourse of a few minutes I observed a pair of horns growing out of the\ncreature's eyes and a bushy tail standing erect on the apex of its head,\nI ceased to be astonished at the sight altogether, and regarded it as\nquite natural and commonplace.  The object afterwards assumed the\nappearance of a lion with a crocodile's bail, and a serpent with a\nmonkey's head, and lastly of a gorilla, without producing in me any\nother feeling than that of profound indifference.  Gradually the whole\nscene vanished, and I became totally oblivious.\n\nThis state of happy unconsciousness had scarcely lasted--it seemed to\nme--two minutes, when I was awakened by Peterkin laying his hand on my\nshoulder and saying--\n\n\"Now then, Ralph, it's time to rouse up.\"\n\n\"O Peterkin,\" said I, in a tone of remonstrance, \"how could you be so\nunkind as to waken me when I had just got to sleep?  Shabby fellow!\"\n\n\"Just got to sleep, say you?  You've been snoring like an apoplectic\nalderman for exactly two hours.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\"  I exclaimed, getting into a sitting posture.\n\n\"Indeed you have.  I'm sorry to rouse you, but time's up, and I'm\nsleepy; so rub your eyes, man, and try to look a little less like an\nastonished owl if you can.  I have just replenished both the fires, so\nyou can lean your back against that palm-tree and take it easy for\nthree-quarters of an hour or so.  After that you'll have to heap on more\nwood.\"\n\nI looked at Jack, who was now lying quite unconscious, breathing with\nthe slow, deep regularity of profound slumber, and with his mouth wide\nopen.\n\n\"What a chance for some waggish baboon to drop a nut or a berry in!\"\nsaid Peterkin, winking at me with one eye as he lay down in the spot\nfrom which I had just risen.\n\nHe was very sleepy, poor fellow, and could hardly smile at his own\nabsurd fancy.  He was asleep almost instantly.  In fact, I do not\nbelieve that he again opened the eye with which he had winked at me, but\nthat he merely shut the other and began to slumber forthwith.\n\nI now began to feel quite interested in my responsible position as\nguardian of the camp.  I examined my rifle to see that it was in order\nand capped; then leaning against the palm-tree, which was, as it were,\nmy sentry-box, I stood erect and rubbed my hands and took off my cap, so\nthat the pleasant night air might play about my temples, and more\neffectually banish drowsiness.\n\nIn order to accomplish this more thoroughly I walked round both fires\nand readjusted the logs, sending up showers of sparks as I did so.  Then\nI went to the edge of the circle of light, in the centre of which our\ncamp lay, and peered into the gloom of the dark forest.\n\nThere was something inexpressibly delightful yet solemn in my feelings\nas I gazed into that profound obscurity where the great tree-stems and\nthe wild gigantic foliage nearest to me appeared ghost-like and\nindistinct, and the deep solitudes of which were peopled, not only with\nthe strange fantastic forms of my excited fancy, but, as I knew full\nwell, with real wild creatures, both huge and small, such as my\nimagination at that time had not fully conceived.  I felt awed, almost\noppressed, with the deep silence around, and, I must confess, looked\nsomewhat nervously over my shoulder as I returned to the fire and sat\ndown to keep watch at my post.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nWHEREIN I MOUNT GUARD, AND HOW I DID IT, ETCETERA.\n\nNow it so happened that the battle which I had to fight with myself\nafter taking my post was precisely the converse of that which I fought\nduring the earlier part of that night.  Then, it was a battle with\nwakefulness; now, it was a struggle with sleep; and of the two fights\nthe latter was the more severe by far.\n\nI began by laying down my rifle close by my side, leaning back in a\nsitting posture against the palm-tree, and resigning myself to the\ncontemplation of the fire, which burned merrily before me, while I\npondered with myself how I should best employ my thoughts during the\nthree long hours of my watch.  But I had not dwelt on that subject more\nthan three minutes, when I was rudely startled by my own head falling\nsuddenly and heavily forward on my chest.  I immediately roused myself.\n\"Ah!  Ralph, Ralph,\" said I to myself in a whisper, \"this won't do, lad.\nTo sleep at your post! shame on you!  Had you been a sentinel in time\nof war that nod would have cost you your life, supposing you to have\nbeen caught in the act.\"\n\nSoliloquising thus, I arose and shook myself.  Then I slapped my chest\nseveral times and pulled my nose and sat down again.  Only a few minutes\nelapsed before the same thing occurred to me again, so I leaped up, and\nmended the fires, and walked to and fro, until I felt thoroughly awake,\nbut in order to make sure that it should not occur again, I walked to\nthe edge of the circle of light and gazed for some time into the dark\nforest, as I had done before.  While standing thus I felt my knees give\nway, as if they had been suddenly paralysed, and I awoke just in time to\nprevent myself falling to the ground.  I must confess I was much amazed\nat this, for although I had often read of soldiers falling asleep\nstanding at their posts, I had never believed the thing possible.\n\nI now became rather anxious, \"for,\" thought I, \"if I go to sleep and the\nfires die down, who knows but wild beasts may come upon us and kill us\nbefore we can seize our arms.\"  For a moment or two I meditated awaking\nJack and begging him to keep me company, but when I reflected that his\nwatch was to come immediately after mine, I had not the heart to do it.\n\"No!\" said I (and I said it aloud for the purpose of preventing\ndrowsiness)--\"no; I will fight this battle alone!  I will repeat some\nstanzas from my favourite authors.  Yes, I will try to remember a\nportion of `A Midsummer-Night's Dream.'  It will be somewhat appropriate\nto my present circumstances.\"\n\nBig with this resolve, I sat down with my face to the fire and my back\nto the palm-tree, and--fell sound asleep instantly!\n\nHow long I lay in this condition I know not, but I was suddenly awakened\nby a yell so appalling that my heart leaped as if into my throat, and my\nnerves thrilled with horror.  For one instant I was paralysed; then my\nblood seemed to rebound on its course.  I sprang up and attempted to\nseize my rifle.\n\nThe reader may judge of my state of mind when I observed that it was\ngone!  I leaped towards the fire, and grasping a lighted brand, turned\nround and glared into the woods in the direction whence the yell came.\n\nIt was grey dawn, and I could see things pretty distinctly; but the only\nliving object that met my gaze was Peterkin, who stood with my rifle in\nhis hand laughing heartily!\n\nI immediately turned to look at Jack, who was sitting up in the spot\nwhere he had passed the night, with a sleepy smile on his countenance.\n\n\"Why, what's the meaning of this?\"  I inquired.\n\n\"The meaning of it?\" cried Peterkin, as he advanced and restored the\nrifle to its place.  \"A pretty fellow you are to mount guard! we might\nhave been all murdered in our sleep by niggers or eaten alive by\ngorillas, for all that you would have done to save us.\"\n\n\"But, Peterkin,\" said I gravely, \"you ought not to have startled me so;\nyou gave me a terrible fright.  People have been driven mad before now,\nI assure you, by practical jokes.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" cried Peterkin, with much earnestness, \"I know that as\nwell as you.  But, in the first place, you were guilty of so heinous a\ncrime that I determined to punish you, and at the same time to do it in\na way that would impress it forcibly on your memory; and in the second\nplace, I would not have done it at all had I not known that your nerves\nare as strong as those of a dray-horse.  You ought to be taking shame to\nyourself on account of your fault rather than objecting to your\npunishment.\"\n\n\"Peterkin is right, my boy,\" said Jack, laughing, \"though I must say he\nhad need be sure of the nerves of any one to whom he intends to\nadminister such a ferocious yell as that.  Anyhow, I have no reason to\ncomplain; for you have given me a good long sleep, although I can't say\nexactly that you have taken my watch.  It will be broad daylight in half\nan hour, so we must be stirring, comrades.\"\n\nOn considering the subject I admitted the force of these remarks, and\nfelt somewhat crestfallen.  No doubt, my companions had treated the\nthing jocularly, and, to say truth, there was much that was comical in\nthe whole affair; but the more I thought of it, the more I came to\nperceive how terrible might have been the consequences of my\nunfaithfulness as a sentinel.  I laid the lesson to heart, and I can\ntruly say that from that day to this I have never again been guilty of\nthe crime of sleeping at my post.\n\nWe now busied ourselves in collecting together the dying embers of our\nfire and in preparing breakfast, which consisted of tea, hard biscuit,\nand cold monkey.  None of us liked the monkey; not that its flesh was\nbad--quite the contrary--but it looked so like a small roasted baby that\nwe could not relish it at all.  However, it was all we had; for we had\nset off on this hunting excursion intending to live by our rifles, but\nhad been unfortunate, having seen nothing except a monkey or two.\n\nThe kettle was soon boiled, and we sat down to our meagre fare with\nhearty appetites.  While we are thus engaged, I shall turn aside for a\nlittle and tell the reader, in one or two brief sentences, how we got to\nthis place.\n\nWe shipped in a merchant ship at Liverpool, and sailed for the west\ncoast of Africa.  Arrived there we found a party, under the command of a\nPortuguese trader, about to set off to the interior.  He could speak a\nlittle English; so we arranged to go with him as far as he intended to\nproceed, learn as much of the native language as possible while in his\ncompany, and then obtain a native guide to conduct us to the country in\nwhich the gorillas are found.  To this native guide, we arranged, should\nbe explained by the trader our object in visiting the country, so that\nhe might tell the tribes whom we intended to visit.  This, we found, was\nan absolutely needful precaution, on the following ground.\n\nThe natives of Africa have a singular and very bad style of carrying on\ntrade with the white men who visit their shores.  The traffic consists\nchiefly of ivory, barwood (a wood much used in dyeing), and indiarubber.\nThe natives of the far interior are not allowed to convey these\ncommodities directly to the coast, but by the law of the land (which\nmeans the law of the strongest, for they are absolute savages) are\nobliged to deliver their goods to the care of the tribe next to them;\nthese pass them on to the next tribe; and so on they go from tribe to\ntribe till they reach the coast, where they are sold by the tribe there.\nThe price obtained, which usually consists of guns, powder and shot,\nlooking-glasses, cloth, and sundry other articles and trinkets useful to\nmen in a savage state, is returned to the owners in the far interior\nthrough the same channel; but as each tribe deducts a percentage for its\ntrouble, the price dwindles down as it goes, until a mere trifle,\nsometimes nothing at all, remains to be handed over to the unfortunate\npeople of the tribe who originally sent off the goods for sale.  Of\ncourse, such a system almost paralyses trade.  But the intermediate\ntribes between the coast and the interior being the gainers by this\nsystem, are exceedingly jealous of anything like an attempt to carry on\ndirect trade.  They are ready to go to war with the tribes of the\ninterior, should they attempt it, and they throw all the opposition they\ncan in the way of the few white men who ever penetrate the interior for\nsuch a purpose.\n\nIt will thus be seen that our travels would be hindered very much, if\nnot stopped altogether, and ourselves be regarded with jealousy, or\nperhaps murdered, if our motives in going inland were not fully and\nsatisfactorily explained to the different tribes as we passed through\ntheir lands.  And we therefore proposed to overcome the difficulty by\ntaking a native guide with us from the tribe with which we should chance\nto be residing when obliged to separate from the Portuguese trader.\n\nWe had now reached this point.  The day before that on which we encamped\nin the woods, as above related, we arrived at a native village, and had\nbeen received kindly by the king.  Almost immediately after our arrival\nwe heard so many stories about gorillas that I felt persuaded we should\nfall in with one if we went a-hunting, and being exceedingly anxious to\nadd one to my collection of animals--for I had a small museum at home--I\nprevailed on Jack and Peterkin to go one day's journey into the bush to\nlook for them.  They laughed very much at me indeed, and said that we\nwere still very far away from the gorilla country; but I had read in\nsome work on Africa a remark to the effect that there is no cordillera,\nor mountain range, extending across the whole continent to limit the\n_habitat_ of certain classes of animals, and I thought that if any\nanimal in Africa would not consent to remain in one region when it\nwished to go to another, that animal must be the ferocious gorilla.  The\ntrader also laughed at me, and said that he had never seen any himself\nin that region, and that we would have to cross the desert before seeing\nthem.  Still, I felt a disposition to try; besides, I felt certain that\nwe should at least fall in with some sort of animals or plants or\nminerals that would be worth collecting; so it was agreed that we should\ngo out for a single day, and be back in time for a great elephant-hunt\nwhich was about to take place.\n\nBut to return from this digression.  Having finished breakfast, we made\nthree bundles or packages of our blankets, provisions, and camp\nequipage; strapped them on our backs; and then, shouldering our rifles,\nset out on our return to the negro village.\n\nOf course we gave Jack the largest and heaviest bundle to carry.\nPeterkin's and mine were about equal, for although I was taller than\nPeterkin, I was not by any means so powerful or active.  I often\nwondered at the great strength that lay in the little frame of my\nfriend.  To look at him, no one would believe that he was such a tough,\nwiry, hardy little fellow.  He was the same hearty, jovial creature that\nI had lived with so pleasantly when he and Jack and I were cast away on\nthe coral island.  With the exception of a small scrap of whisker on\neach cheek, a scar over the right eye, and a certain air of manliness,\nthere was little change in my old comrade.\n\n\"Ralph,\" said Jack, as we strode along through the forest, \"do you\nremember how we three used to wander about together in the woods of our\ncoral island?\"\n\n\"Remember!\"  I cried with enthusiasm, for at that moment the thought\noccurred to my own mind; \"how can I ever forget it, Jack?  It seems to\nme just like yesterday.  I can hardly believe that six long years have\npassed since we drank that delicious natural lemonade out of the green\ncocoa-nuts, and wandered on the coral beach, and visited Penguin Island,\nand dived into the cave to escape the pirates.  The whole scene rises up\nbefore me so vividly that I could fancy we were still there.  Ah! these\nwere happy times.\"\n\n\"So they were,\" cried Peterkin; \"but don't you go and become\nsentimentally sad, Ralph, when you talk of those happy days.  If we were\nhappy there, are we not happy _here_?--There's no change in us--except,\nindeed, that Jack has become a gorilla.\"\n\n\"Ay, and you a monkey,\" retorted Jack.\n\n\"True; and Ralph a naturalist, which is the strangest beast of all,\"\nadded Peterkin.--\"Can you tell me, Ralph, by the way, what tree that\nis?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I cannot tell.  Never saw or heard of one like it before,\" I\nreplied, looking at the tree referred to with some interest.  It was a\nfine tree, but the great beauty about it was the gorgeous fruit with\nwhich it was laden.  It hung in the form of bunches of large grapes, and\nwas of the brightest scarlet colour.  The glowing bunches seemed like\nprecious gems glittering amongst the green foliage, and I observed that\na few monkeys and several parrots were peeping at us through the\nbranches.\n\n\"It seems good for food,\" said Jack.  \"You'd better climb up, Peterkin,\nand pull a few bunches.  The puggies won't mind you, of course, being\none of themselves.\"\n\n\"Ralph,\" said Peterkin, turning to me, and deigning no reply to Jack,\n\"you call yourself a naturalist; so I suppose you are acquainted with\nthe habits of monkeys, and can turn your knowledge to practical\naccount.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"I know something about the monkey tribes, but I\ncannot say that at this moment I remember any particular habit of which\nwe might avail ourselves.\"\n\n\"Do you not?  Well, now, that's odd.  I'm a student of nature myself,\nand I have picked up a little useful knowledge in the course of my\ntravels.  Did you ever travel so far as the Zoological Gardens in\nLondon?\"\n\n\"Of course I have done so, often.\"\n\n\"And did you ever observe a peculiar species of monkey, which, when you\nmade a face at it, instantly flew into a towering passion, and shook the\nbars of its cage until you expected to see them broken?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, laughing; \"what then?\"\n\n\"Look here, you naturalist, and I'll put a wrinkle on your horn.  Yonder\nhangs a magnificent bunch of fruit that I very much desire to possess.\"\n\n\"But it's too high to reach,\" said I.\n\n\"But there's a monkey sitting beside it,\" said Peterkin.\n\n\"I see.  You don't expect him to pull it and throw it down, do you?\"\n\n\"Oh no, certainly not; but--\" Here Peterkin stepped up to the tree, and\nlooking up at the monkey, said, \"O-o-o-oo-o!\" angrily.\n\n\"_O-o-o-oo-oo_!\" replied the monkey, stretching out its neck and looking\ndown with an expression of surprise and indignation, as if to say, \"What\non earth do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Oo-o-o-oo-o!\" roared Peterkin.\n\nHereupon the monkey uttered a terrific shriek of passion, exposed all\nits teeth and gums, glared at its adversary like a little fiend, and\nseizing the branch with both hands, shook it with all its might.  The\nresult was, that not only did the coveted bunch of fruit fall to the\nground, but a perfect shower of bunches came down, one of which hit Jack\non the forehead, and, bursting there, sent its fragrant juice down his\nface and into his beard, while the parrots and all the other monkeys\ntook to flight, shrieking with mingled terror and rage.\n\n\"You see I'm a practical man,\" observed Peterkin quietly, as he picked\nup the fruit and began to eat it.  \"Knowledge is power, my boy.  A man\nwith a philosophical turn of mind like yourself ought to have been up to\na dodge of this sort.  How capital this fruit is, to be sure!--Does it\nmake good pomade, Jack?\"\n\n\"Excellent; but as I'm not in the habit of using pomade, I shall wash\nthis out of my beard as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWhile Jack went to a brook that ran close to where we stood, I tasted\nthe fruit, and found it most excellent, the pulp being juicy, with a\nvery pleasant flavour.\n\nWhile we were thus engaged a wild pig ran grunting past us.\n\n\"Doesn't that remind you of some of our doings on the coral island,\nRalph?\" said Peterkin.\n\nBefore I could reply a herd of lovely small gazelles flew past.  Our\nrifles were lying on the ground, and before either of us could take aim\nthe swift creatures were lost sight of in the thick underwood.  Peterkin\nfired one shot at a venture, but without any result.\n\nWe were still deploring our stupidity in not having our rifles handy,\nwhen a strange sound was heard in the distance.  By this time Jack had\ncome up, so we all three seized our rifles and listened intently.  The\nsound was evidently approaching.  It was a low, dull, booming roar,\nwhich at one moment seemed to be distant thunder, at another the cry of\nsome huge animal in rage or pain.  Presently the beating of heavy hoofs\non the turf and the crash of branches were heard.  Each of us sprang\ninstinctively towards a tree, feeling that if danger were near its trunk\nwould afford us some protection.\n\nBeing ignorant, as yet, of the cries of the various wild beasts\ninhabiting those woods, we were greatly at a loss to determine what\ncreature it could be that approached at such headlong speed.  That its\nmad career was caused by fear soon became apparent, for the tones of\nterror either in man or beast, when distinctly heard, cannot be\nmistaken.\n\nImmediately in front of the spot where we stood was an open space or\nglade of considerable extent.  Towards this the animal approached, as\nwas evident from the increasing loudness of its wild roar, which was\nalmost continuous.  In another moment the thick wall of underwood at its\nfarther extremity was burst asunder with a crash, and a wild buffalo\nbull bounded into the plain and dashed madly across.  On its neck was\ncrouched a leopard, which had fixed its claws and teeth deep in the\nflesh of the agonised animal.  In vain did the bull bound and rear, toss\nand plunge.  At one moment it ran like the wind; the next it stopped\nwith such violence as to tear up the turf and scatter it around.  Then\nit reared, almost falling back; anon it plunged and rushed on again,\nwith the foam flying from its mouth, and its bloodshot eyes glaring with\nthe fire of rage and terror, while the woods seemed to tremble with its\nloud and deep-toned bellowing.  Twice in its passage across the open\nglade it ran, in its blind fury, straight against a tree, almost beating\nin its skull, and for a moment arresting its progress; but it instantly\nrecovered the shock and burst away again as madly as ever.  But no\neffort that it was capable of making could relieve the poor creature\nfrom its deadly burden, or cause the leopard in the slightest degree to\nrelax its fatal gripe.\n\nIt chanced that the wild bull's mad gallop was in a direction that\nbrought it within a few yards of the spot where we stood, so we prepared\nto put an end to its misery.  As it drew near, Jack, who was in advance,\nraised his rifle.  I, being only a short distance from him, also made\nready to fire, although I confess that in the agitation of the moment I\ncould not make up my mind whether I should fire at the buffalo or the\nleopard.  As far as I can recall my rapid and disjointed thoughts on\nthat exciting occasion, I reasoned thus: \"If I shoot the leopard the\nbull will escape, and if I shoot the bull the leopard will escape.\"  It\ndid not occur to me at that trying moment, when self-possession and\ndecision were so necessary, that I might shoot the bull with one barrel,\nand the leopard with the other.  Still less did it occur to me that I\nmight miss bull and leopard altogether.\n\nWhile I was engaged in this hurried train of troubled thought, Jack\nfired both barrels of his rifle, one after the other, as quickly as\npossible.  The bull stumbled forward upon its knees.  In order to make\nassurance doubly sure, I aimed at its head and fired both barrels at\nonce.  Instantly the bull rose, with a hideous bellow, and stood for one\nmoment irresolute, glaring at its new enemies.  The leopard, I observed,\nwas no longer on its back.  At this moment I heard an exclamation of\nanger, and looking round I observed Peterkin struggling violently in the\ngrasp of one of the wild vines or thorny plants which abound in some\nparts of the African forests and render them almost impassable.  It\nseems that as the bull drew near, Peterkin, who, like Jack and me, was\npreparing to shoot, found that a dense thicket came between him and the\ngame, so as to prevent his firing.  He leaped nimbly over a bush,\nintending to run to another spot, whence he could more conveniently take\naim, but found himself, as I have related, suddenly entangled among the\nthorns in such a way that the more he struggled the more firmly he\nbecame ensnared.  Being of an impatient disposition, he did struggle\nviolently, and it was this, probably, that attracted the attention of\nthe bull and decided its future course and its ultimate fate; for after\nremaining one moment, as I have stated, in an irresolute attitude, it\nturned suddenly to the left and rushed, with its head down and its tail\nup, straight at Peterkin.\n\nI cannot describe the sensations that overwhelmed me on observing the\nimminent danger of my friend.  Horror almost overwhelmed me as I gazed\nwith a stare of fascination at the frightful brute, which with flashing\neyes and bloody foam dripping from its mouth charged into the thicket,\nand crashed through the tough boughs and bushes as if they were grass.\nA film came over my eyes.  I tried to reload my rifle, but my trembling\nhand refused to act, and I groaned with mingled shame and despair on\nfinding myself thus incapable of action in the hour of extreme peril.\nAt that moment I felt I would joyfully have given my own life to have\nsaved that of Peterkin.  It takes me long to describe it, but the whole\nscene passed with the rapidity almost of a flash of light.\n\nJack did not even attempt to load, but uttering a fearful cry, he sprang\ntowards our friend with a bound like that of an enraged tiger.  A gleam\nof hope flashed through my soul as I beheld his gigantic form dash\nthrough the underwood.  It seemed to me as if no living creature could\nwithstand such a furious onset.  Alas for Peterkin, had his life\ndepended on Jack, strong and lion-like though he was!  His aid could not\nhave been in time.  A higher Power nerved his arm and steeled his heart\nat that terrible moment.  As I gazed helplessly at Peterkin, I observed\nthat he suddenly ceased his struggles to get free, and throwing forward\nthe muzzle of his piece, stood boldly up and awaited the onset with calm\nself-possession.  The bull was on him almost in an instant.  One stride\nmore and he would have been lost, but that stride was never taken.  His\nrifle poured its deadly charge into the skull of the wild bull, which\nfell a mass of dead flesh, literally at his feet.\n\nIt were vain to attempt to describe the state of our feelings on this\nmemorable occasion--the fervour with which we thanked our heavenly\nFather for our friend's deliverance--the delight with which we shook his\nhands, again and again, and embraced him.  It was with considerable\ndifficulty that we extricated Peterkin from his entanglement.  When this\nwas accomplished we proceeded to examine our prize.\n\nWe were not a little puzzled on discovering that only three bullets had\nstruck the bull.  For my part, I fired straight at its forehead, and had\nfelt certain at the time that my shots had taken effect; yet there was\nbut one ball in the animal's head, and that was undoubtedly Peterkin's,\nfor the hair all round the hole was singed off, so near had it been to\nhim when he fired.  The other two shots were rather wide apart--one in\nthe shoulder, the other in the neck.  Both would have proved mortal in\nthe long run, but neither was sufficiently near to a vital spot to kill\nspeedily.\n\n\"Now, Ralph, my boy,\" said Jack, after our excitement was in some degree\nabated, \"you and I must divide the honour of these two shots, for I fear\nwe can't tell which of us fired them.  Peterkin only fired once, and\nthat was pretty effectual.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"it is rather perplexing; for although I have no\nobjection whatever to your having all the honour of those two shots,\nstill one likes to know with certainty who actually made them.\"\n\n\"You'd better toss for them,\" suggested Peterkin, who was seated on the\ntrunk of a fallen tree, examining, with a somewhat rueful countenance,\nthe tattered condition of his garments.\n\n\"There would not be much satisfaction in that,\" replied Jack, laughing.\n\n\"It is probable,\" said I, \"that each of us hit with one barrel and\nmissed with the other.\"\n\n\"And it is possible,\" added Jack, \"that one of us hit with both, and the\nother missed with both.  All that I can positively affirm is that I\nfired both barrels at his shoulder--one after the other.\"\n\n\"And all that I am certain of,\" said I, \"is that I fired both barrels at\nhis forehead, and that I discharged them both at once.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" said Peterkin, looking up quickly; \"then, Ralph, I'm afraid\nyou must give all the honour to Jack, for you have missed altogether.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"  I asked, in a somewhat piqued tone.\n\n\"Simply enough.  If you fired both shots together at so short a\ndistance, they would have been found close together wherever they had\nstruck, whereas the two shots in the neck and shoulder are more than two\nfeet apart.\"\n\nI was compelled to admit that there was much truth in the observation,\nbut still felt unwilling to give up all claim to having assisted in\nslaying our first buffalo.  I pondered the subject a good deal during\nthe remainder of the time we spent in cutting up and packing part of the\nbuffalo meat, and in preparing to continue our journey, but could come\nat no satisfactory conclusion in my own mind, and, to say truth, I felt\nnot a little crestfallen at my conduct in the whole affair.\n\nWhile wandering in this mood near the spot where the buffalo had been\nfirst wounded, I received a sudden and severe start on observing the\nleopard crouching within a couple of yards of me.  I saw it through the\nbushes quite distinctly, but could not make quite sure of its attitude.\nWith a mingled cry of alarm and astonishment I sprang back to the place\nwhere I had left my rifle.\n\nJack and Peterkin instantly ran up with their pieces cocked.\n\n\"Where is it?\" they cried in a breath.\n\n\"There, crouching just behind that bush.\"\n\nJack darted forward.\n\n\"Crouching!\" he cried, with a loud laugh, seizing the animal by the tail\nand dragging it forth; \"why, it's dead--stone dead.\"\n\n\"Dead as mutton,\" said Peterkin.  \"Hallo! what's this?\" he added in\nsurprise.  \"Two holes close together in its forehead, I do declare!\nHooray!  Ralph, my boy, give us your paw!  You've missed the bull and\nhit the leopard!  If you haven't been and put two bullets right between\nits two eyes, I'm a Dutchman!\"\n\nAnd so, in truth, it turned out.  I had aimed at the bull and hit the\nleopard.  So I left that spot not a little pleased with my bad aim and\nmy good fortune.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nWHEREIN WILL BE FOUND MUCH THAT IS PHILOSOPHICAL.\n\nHaving skinned the leopard and cut off as much of the buffalo meat as we\ncould carry, we started for the negro village at a round pace, for we\nhad already lost much time in our last adventure.  As we walked along I\ncould not help meditating on the uncertainty of this life, and the\nterrible suddenness with which we might at any unexpected moment be cut\noff.  These thoughts led me naturally to reflect how important a matter\nit is that every one, no matter how young, should be in a state of\npreparedness to quit this world.\n\nI also reflected, and not without a feeling of shame, on my want of\nnerve, and was deeply impressed with the importance of boys being inured\nfrom childhood to trifling risks and light dangers of every possible\ndescription, such as tumbling into ponds and off trees, etcetera, in\norder to strengthen their nervous system.  I do not, of course, mean to\nsay that boys ought deliberately to tumble into ponds or climb trees\nuntil they fall off; but they ought not to avoid the risk of such\nmishaps.  They ought to encounter such risks and many others\nperpetually.  They ought to practise leaping off heights into deep\nwater.  They ought never to hesitate to cross a stream on a narrow\nunsafe plank _for fear of a ducking_.  They ought never to decline to\nclimb up a tree to pull fruit merely because there is a _possibility_ of\ntheir falling off and breaking their necks.  I firmly believe that boys\nwere intended to encounter all kinds of risks, in order to prepare them\nto meet and grapple with the risks and dangers incident to man's career\nwith cool, cautious self-possession--a self-possession founded on\nexperimental knowledge of the character and powers of their own spirits\nand muscles.  I also concluded that this reasoning applies to some\nextent to girls as well as boys, for they too are liable through life to\noccasional encounters with danger--such as meeting with mad bulls, being\nrun away with on horseback, being upset in boats, being set on fire by\nmeans of crinoline; in all of which cases those who have been trained to\nrisk slight mishaps during early life will find their nerves equal to\nthe shock, and their minds cool and collected enough to look around and\ntake hasty advantage of any opportunity of escape that may exist; while\nthose who have been unhappily nurtured in excessive delicacy, and\nadvised from the earliest childhood to \"take care of themselves and\ncarefully avoid all risks,\" will probably fall victims to their nervous\nalarms and the kind but injudicious training of parents or guardians.\n\nThe more I pondered this subject the more deeply impressed did I become\nwith its great importance to the well-being of mankind, and I was so\nprofoundly engrossed with it that my companions utterly failed to engage\nme in general conversation as we walked briskly along through the\nforest.  Jack again and again attempted to draw my attention to the\nsplendour of the curious specimens of tropical foliage and vegetation\nthrough which we passed; but I could not rouse myself to take interest\ntherein.  In vain did Peterkin jest and rally me, and point out the\nmonkeys that grinned at us ever and anon as we passed beneath them, or\nthe serpents that glided more than once from our path, I was fascinated\nwith my train of meditation, and as I could not then give it up until I\nhad thought it out, so now I cannot pass from the subject until I have\nat least endeavoured to guard myself from misconception.\n\nI beg, then, that it will be understood that I do not by any means\ninculcate hare-brained recklessness, or a course of training that will\nfoster that state of mind.  On the contrary, the course of training\nwhich I should like to see universally practised would naturally tend to\ncounteract recklessness, for it would enable a boy to judge correctly as\nto what he could and could not do.  Take an illustration.  A naturally\nbold boy has been unwisely trained to be exceedingly careful of himself.\nHe does not know the extent of his own courage, or the power and\nagility of his own muscles; he knows these things to some extent indeed,\nbut owing to restraint he does not know them fully.  Hence he is liable\nboth to over and under estimate them.\n\nThis bold boy--we shall call him Tom--takes a walk into the country with\na friend, whom we shall name Pat.  Pat is a bad boy, but he has been\npermitted to train his muscles as he pleased, and his natural\ndisposition has led him to do difficult and sometimes slightly dangerous\nthings.\n\n\"You can't jump over that river, Tom,\" says Pat.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" replies Tom: \"I never tried such a jump, because my\nmother tells me never to go where I am likely to tumble into the water.\"\n\n\"Oh, your mother's a muff!\" cries Pat.\n\n\"Pat,\" says Tom, flushing with indignation and confronting his friend,\n\"don't you ever say that again, else the friendship between you and me\nwill come to an end.  I know you don't really mean what you say; but I\nwon't allow you to speak disrespectfully of my mother.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't,\" says Pat, \"but _you're_ a muff, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am,\" replies Tom.\n\n\"Of course you are, because you're afraid to jump over that river, and\nI'm not.  So here goes.\"\n\nPat thereupon jumps the river (he is a splendid leaper), and Tom\nhesitates.\n\n\"Come along, Tom; don't be a hen.\"\n\nTom gives way, alas! to a disobedient impulse, and dashing at the leap\ncomes to the edge, when he finds, somehow, that he has not got the\nproper foot first for the spring--almost every boy knows the feeling I\nallude to; his heart fails, and he balks.\n\n\"O Tom, what a nimini-pimini muff you are, to be sure!\"\n\nTom, as I have said, is a bold boy.  His blood boils at this; he rushes\nwildly at the bank, hurls himself recklessly into the air, barely\nreaches the opposite side with a scramble, and falls souse into the\nriver, from which he issues, as Pat says amid peals of laughter, \"like a\nhalf-drowned rat.\"\n\nNow, had Tom been permitted to follow the bent of his own bold impulses,\nhe would have found out, years ago, how far and how high he could leap,\nand how far exactly he could depend on his own courage in certain\ncircumstances; and he would either, on the one hand, have measured the\nleap with an accustomed eye, and declined to take it with a\ngood-humoured admission that it was beyond his powers, or, on the other\nhand, he would calmly have collected his well and oft tried energies for\nthe spring.  The proper foot, from long experience, would have come to\nthe ground at the right time.  His mind, freed from all anxiety as to\nwhat he could accomplish, would have received a beneficial impulse from\nhis friend's taunt.  No nervous dread of a ducking would have checked\nthe completeness of his bound, because he would have often been ducked\nbefore, and would have discovered that in most cases, if the clothes be\nchanged at once, a ducking is not worth mentioning--from a hydropathic\npoint of view is, in fact, beneficial--and he would have cleared the\nriver with comfort to himself and confusion to his friend, and without a\nducking or the uneasiness of conscience caused by the knowledge that he\nhad disobeyed his mother.  Had Peterkin not been trained to encounter\ndanger, his natural boldness alone would never have enabled him to stand\nthe charge of that buffalo bull.\n\nThere are muffs in this world.  I do not refer to those hairy articles\nof female apparel in which ladies are wont to place their hands,\nhandkerchiefs, and scent-bottles.  Although not given to the use of\nslang, I avail myself of it on this occasion, the word \"muff\" being\neminently expressive of a certain class of boys, big as well as little,\nold as well as young.  There are three distinct classes of boys--namely,\nmuffs, sensible fellows, and boasters.  I say there are three distinct\nclasses, but I do not say that every boy belongs to one or other of\nthose classes.  Those who have studied chemistry know that nature's\nelements are few.  Nearly all kinds of matter, and certainly all\nvarieties of mind, are composite.  There are no pure and simple muffs.\nMost boasters have a good deal of the muff in them, and many muffs are\nboasters; while sensible fellows are occasionally tinged with a dash of\nboth the bad qualities--they are, if I may be allowed to coin a word,\n_sensible-boasto-muffers_!  Still, for the sake of lucidity, I will\nmaintain that there are three distinct phases of character in boys.\n\nThe muff is a boy who from natural disposition, or early training, or\nboth, is mild, diffident, and gentle.  So far he is an estimable\ncharacter.  Were this all, he were not a muff.  In order to deserve that\ntitle he must be timid and unenthusiastic.  He must refuse to venture\nanything that will subject him to danger, however slight.  He must be\nafraid of a shower of rain; afraid of dogs in general, good and bad\nalike; disinclined to try bold things; indifferent about learning to\nswim.  He must object to the game called \"dumps,\" because the blows from\nthe ball are sometimes severe; and be a sworn enemy to single-stick,\nbecause the whacks are uncommonly painful.  So feeling and acting, he\nwill, when he becomes a man, find himself unable to act in the common\nemergencies of life--to protect a lady from insolence, to guard his\nhouse from robbery, or to save his own child should it chance to fall\ninto the water.  The muff is addicted to boasting sometimes, especially\nwhen in the company of girls; but when on the playground he hangs on the\nskirts of society, and sings very small.  There are many boys, alas! who\nare made muffs by injudicious training, who would have grown up to be\nbold, manly fellows had they been otherwise treated.  There are also\nmany kinds of muffs.  Some are good-hearted, amiable muffs; others are\npetty, sneaking muffs.\n\nWith many of the varieties I have a strong sympathy, and for their\ncomfort I would say that muffs may cure themselves if they choose to try\nenergetically.\n\nCourage and cowardice are not two distinct and entirely antagonistic\nqualities.  To a great extent those qualities are the result of\ntraining.  Every courageous man has a slight amount of cowardice in his\ncomposition, and all cowards have a certain infusion of courage.  The\nmatador stands before the infuriated bull, and awaits its charge with\nunflinching firmness, not because he has more courage than his comrades\nin the ring who run away, but because long training has enabled him to\nmake almost certain of killing the bull.  He knows what he has done\nbefore, he feels that he can do it again, therefore he stands like a\nhero.  Were a doubt of his capacity to cross his mind for an instant,\nhis cheek would blanch, his hand would tremble, and, ten to one, he\nwould turn and flee like the rest.\n\nLet muffs, therefore, learn to swim, to leap, and to run.  Let them\nwrestle with boys bigger than themselves, regardless of being thrown.\nLet them practise \"jinking\" with their companions, so that if even they\nbe chased by a mad bull, they will, if unable to get out of his way by\nrunning, escape perhaps by jinking.  Let them learn to leap off\nconsiderable heights into deep water, so that, if ever called on to leap\noff the end of a pier or the side of a ship to save a fellow-creature,\nthey may do so with confidence and promptitude.  Let them even put on\n\"the gloves,\" and become regardless of a swelled nose, in order that\nthey may be able to defend themselves or others from sudden assault.  So\ndoing they will become sensible fellows, whose character I have thus to\nsome extent described.  Of course, I speak of sensible fellows only with\nreference to this one subject of training the nerves and muscles.  Let\nit never be forgotten that there are men who, although sensible in this\nrespect, are uncommonly senseless in regard to other things of far\nhigher moment.\n\nAs to boasters, I will dismiss them with a few words.  They are too\neasily known to merit particular description.  They are usually loud and\nbold in the drawing-room, but rather mild in the field.  They are\ndesperately egotistical, fond of exaggeration, and prone to depreciate\nthe deeds of their comrades.  They make bad soldiers and sailors, and\nare usually held in contempt by others, whatever they may think of\nthemselves.  I may wind up this digression--into which I have been\ntempted by an earnest desire to warn my fellow-men against the errors of\nnervous and muscular education, which, in my case, led to the weak\nconduct of which I had been guilty that day--I may wind up this\ndigression, I say, by remarking that the boys who are most loved in this\nworld are those who are lambs, _almost_ muffs, in the drawing-room, but\nlions in the field.\n\nHow long I should have gone on pondering this subject I know not, but\nPeterkin somewhat rudely interrupted me by uttering a wild scream, and\nbeginning to caper as if he were a madman.  I was much alarmed as well\nas surprised at this course of conduct; for although my friend was an\ninveterate joker, he was the very reverse of what is termed a buffoon,\nand never indulged in personally grotesque actions with a view to make\npeople laugh--such as making faces, a practice which, in ninety-nine\ncases out of a hundred, causes the face-makers to look idiotical rather\nthan funny, and induces beholders to pity them, and to feel very\nuncomfortable sensations.\n\nPeterkin's yells, instead of ceasing, continued and increased.\n\n\"Why, what's wrong?\"  I cried, in much alarm.\n\nInstead of answering, Peterkin darted away through the wood like a\nmaniac, tearing off his clothes as he went.  At the same moment Jack\nbegan to roar like a bull, and became similarly distracted.  It now\nflashed across me that they must have been attacked by an army of the\nBashikouay ant, a species of ant which is so ferocious as to prove a\nperfect scourge to the parts of the country over which it travels.  The\nthought had scarcely occurred to me when I was painfully convinced of\nits accuracy.  The ants suddenly came to me, and in an instant I was\ncovered from head to foot by the passionate creatures, which hit me so\nseverely that I also began to scream and to tear off my garments; for I\nhad been told by the trader who accompanied us to this part of the\ncountry that this was the quickest method of getting rid of them.\n\nWe all three fled, and soon left the army of Bashikouay ants behind us,\nundressing, as we ran, in the best way we could; and when we at length\ncame to a halt we found ourselves almost in a state of nudity.  Hastily\ndivesting ourselves of the remainder of our apparel, we assisted each\nother to clear away the ants, though we could not rid ourselves of the\npainful effects of the bites with which we were covered.\n\n\"What dreadful villains!\" gasped Peterkin, as he busied himself in\nhastily picking off the furious creatures from his person.\n\n\"It would be curious to observe the effect of an army of soldiers\nstepping into an army of Bashikouays,\" said Jack.  \"They would be routed\ninstantly.  No discipline or courage could hold them together for two\nminutes after they were attacked.\"\n\nI was about to make some reply, when our attention was attracted by a\nshout at no great distance, and in a few seconds we observed, to our\nconfusion, the trader and a band of negroes approaching us.  We hurried\non our clothes as rapidly as possible, and were a little more\npresentable when they arrived.  They had a good laugh at us, of course,\nand the naked blacks seemed to be much tickled with the idea that we had\nbeen compelled to divest ourselves, even for a short time, of what they\nconsidered our unnecessary covering.\n\n\"We thought you were lost,\" said the trader, \"and I began to blame\nmyself for letting you away into the woods, where so many dangers may be\nencountered, without a guide.  But what have you got there? meat of some\nkind?  Your guns seem to have done service on this your first\nexpedition.\"\n\n\"Ay, that they have,\" answered Jack.  \"We've killed a buffalo bull, and\nif you send your black fellows back on our track for some hours they'll\ncome to the carcass, of which we could not, of course, bring very much\naway on our shoulders, which are not accustomed yet to heavy loads.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Peterkin, \"we were anxious to get back in time for your\nelephant-hunt, else we should have brought more meat with us.  But Jack\nhas not mentioned what I consider our chief prize, the honour of\nshooting which belongs to my friend Ralph Rover.--Come, Ralph, unfasten\nyour pack and let them see it.\"\n\nAlthough unwilling to put off more time, I threw down my pack, and\nuntying it, displayed my leopard skin.  The shout of delight and\nsurprise which the sight of it drew from the negroes was so enthusiastic\nthat I at once perceived I was considered to have secured a great prize.\n\n\"Why, Mr Rover, you're in luck,\" said the trader, examining the skin;\n\"it's not every day that one falls in with such a fine leopard as that.\nAnd you have already made a reputation as a daring hunter, for the\nniggers consider it a bold and dangerous thing to attack these critters;\nthey're so uncommon fierce.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do not by any means deserve such a reputation,\" said I,\nrefastening my pack, \"for the shot was entirely accidental; so I pray\nyou, good sir, to let the negroes know that, as I have no desire to go\nunder a false flag, as my friend Peterkin would say--\"\n\n\"Go under a false flag!\" exclaimed Peterkin, in contempt.  \"Sail under\nfalse colours, man!  That's what you should have said.  Whatever you do,\nRalph, never misquote a man.  Go under a false flag! ha, ha!  Why, you\nmight just as well have said, `progress beneath assumed bunting.'\"\n\n\"Well, accidental or otherwise,\" said the trader, \"you've got credit for\nthe deed, and your fame will be spread among the tribe whether you will\nor not; for these fellows are such incorrigible liars themselves that\nthey will never believe you if you tell them the shot was accidental.\nThey will only give you credit for some strange though unknown motive in\ntelling such a falsehood.\"\n\nWhile the trader was speaking I observed that the negroes were talking\nwith the eager looks and gesticulations that are peculiar to the\nAfricans when excited, and presently two or three of them came forward\nand asked several questions, while their eyes sparkled eagerly and their\nblack faces shone with animation as they pointed into the woods in the\ndirection whence we had come.\n\n\"They want to know where you have left the carcass of the leopard, and\nif you have taken away the brains,\" said the trader, turning to me.  \"I\ndaresay you know--if not you'll soon come to find out--that all the\nnigger tribes in Africa are sunk in gross and cruel superstitions.  They\nhave more fetishes, and greegrees, and amulets, and wooden gods, and\ncharms, than they know what to do with, and have surrounded themselves\nwith spiritual mysteries that neither themselves nor anybody else can\nunderstand.  Among other things, they attach a very high value to the\nbrains of the leopard, because they imagine that he who possesses them\nwill be rendered extraordinarily bold and successful in hunting.  These\nfellows are in hopes that, being ignorant of the value of leopard\nbrains, you have left them in the carcass, and are burning with anxiety\nto be off after them.\"\n\n\"Poor creatures!\" said I, \"they are heartily welcome to the brains; and\nthe carcass lies not more than four hours' march from this spot, I\nshould think,--Is it not so, Jack?\"\n\nMy friend nodded assent, and the trader, turning to the expectant crowd\nof natives, gave them the information they desired.  No sooner had he\nfinished than with loud cries they turned and darted away, tossing their\narms wildly in the air, and looking more like to a band of scared\nmonkeys than to human beings.\n\n\"They're queer fellows,\" remarked Peterkin.\n\n\"So they are,\" replied the trader, \"and they're kindly fellows too--\njovial and good-humoured, except when under the influence of their\nabominable superstitions.  Then they become incarnate fiends, and commit\ndeeds of cruelty that make one's blood run cold to think of.\"\n\nI felt much saddened by these remarks, and asked the trader if the\nmissionaries accomplished any good among them.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he replied, \"they do much good, such of them at least as\nreally are missionaries; for it does not follow that every one who wears\na black coat and white neck-cloth, and goes abroad, is a missionary.\nBut what can a few men scattered along the coast here and there, however\nearnest they be, do among the thousands upon thousands of savages that\nwander about in the interior of Africa?  No good will ever be done in\nthis land, to any great extent, until traders and missionaries go hand\nin hand into the interior, and the system of trade is entirely\nremodelled.\"\n\n\"From what you remark,\" said I, feeling much interested, \"I should\nsuppose that you have given this subject a good deal of attention.\"\n\n\"I have.  But there are people in this world who, supposing that because\nI am a trader I am therefore prone to exalt trade to an equality with\nreligion, do not give me credit for disinterestedness when I speak.\nPerhaps you are one of these.\"\n\n\"Not I, in truth,\" said I, earnestly.  \"My chief desire in conversing\nwith mankind is to acquire knowledge; I therefore listen with attention\nand respect to the opinions of others, instead of endeavouring to assert\nmy own.  In the present instance, being ignorant, I have no opinions to\nassert.\"\n\n\"I wish there were more people in your country,\" replied the trader,\n\"who felt as you do.  I would tell them that, although a trader, I\nregard the salvation of men's souls as the most important work in this\nworld.  I would argue that until you get men to listen, you cannot\npreach the gospel to them; that the present system of trade in Africa is\nin itself antagonistic to religion, being based upon dishonesty, and\nthat, therefore, the natives will not listen to missionaries--of course,\nin some cases they will; for I believe that the gospel, when truly\npreached, is never preached in vain--but they will throw every possible\nimpediment in their way.  I would tell them that in order to make the\npath of the missionary practicable, the system of trade must be\ninverted, the trader and the missionary must go hand in hand, and\ncommerce and religion--although incomparably different in their nature\nand ends--must act the part of brother and sister if anything _great_ is\nto be done for the poor natives of Africa.\"\n\nConversing thus we beguiled the time pleasantly while we proceeded\nrapidly on our way, for the day was drawing to a close, and we were\nstill at a considerable distance from the native village.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR A GRAND HUNT.\n\nAll was bustle, noise, and activity in the village, or, more correctly\nspeaking, in the native town of his Majesty King Jambai, early in the\nmorning after our arrival.  A great elephant-hunt had been resolved on.\nThe hunters were brushing up their spears and old guns--all of which\nlatter were flint-locks that had been procured from traders, and were\nnot worth more than a few shillings.  The women were busy preparing\nbreakfast, and the children were playing around their huts.\n\nThese huts were of the simplest construction--made of bamboo, roofed\nwith large palm-leaves, and open in front.  The wants of savages are\ngenerally few; their household furniture is very plain, and there is\nlittle of it.  A large hut near to that of his sable majesty had been\nset apart for the trader and his party during our residence at the town.\nIn this we had spent the night as pleasantly as we could, but the\nmosquitoes kept up an unceasing warfare upon us, so that daylight was\nwelcomed gladly when it came.\n\nOn going to the hut of King Jambai, who had invited us to breakfast with\nhim, we found the Princess Oninga alone, seated in the king's armchair\nand smoking her pipe with uncommon gusto.  She had spent the early part\nof the morning in preparing breakfast for her father and ourselves, and\nwas now resting from her labours.\n\n\"You are early astir, Princess Oninga,\" said the trader as we entered\nand took our seats round the fire, for at that hour the air felt chilly.\n\nThe princess took her pipe from her lips and admitted that she was,\nblowing a long thin cloud of smoke into the air with a sigh of\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"We are ready for breakfast,\" added the trader.  \"Is the king at home?\"\n\n\"He is in the woods, but will be back quickly.\"  With this remark the\nprincess rose, and knocking the ashes out of her pipe, left the tent.\n\n\"Upon my word, she's a cool beauty,\" said Peterkin.\n\n\"I should rather say a black one,\" remarked Jack.\n\n\"Perhaps an odd one would be the most appropriate term,\" said I.  \"Did\nyou ever see such a headdress?\"\n\nThe manner in which the Princess Oninga had seen fit to dress her head\nwas indeed peculiar, I may say ludicrous.  Her woolly hair had been\narranged in the form of a cocked hat, with a horn projecting in front,\nand at a short distance off it might easily have been mistaken for the\nheadpiece of a general officer minus the feathers.  There was little in\nthe way of artificial ornament about it, but the princess wore a number\nof heavy brass rings on her arms and ankles.  Those on the latter\nreached half-way up to her knees, and they were so heavy that her walk\nwas little better than a clumsy waddle.  Before we could pass further\ncomment on her appearance, King Jambai entered, and saluted us by taking\nus each separately and rubbing noses with us.  This done, he ordered in\nbreakfast, which consisted of roast and boiled plantains, ground nuts,\nroast fowl, and roast pig; so we fell to at once, and being exceedingly\nhungry after our long walk of the day before, made a hearty meal.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Jack, when our repast was about concluded, \"as you are\ngoing to leave us soon, you had better arrange with the king about\ngetting us an interpreter and supplying us with a few men to carry our\ngoods.  I think you said there was once a man in the tribe who spoke a\nlittle English.  Have you found out whether he is alive?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have heard that he is alive and well, and is expected in every\nday from a hunting expedition.  He is a splendid hunter and a capital\nfellow.  His name is Makarooroo, and if you get him you will be\nfortunate.\"\n\n\"Then ask his black majesty,\" said Peterkin, \"as quick as you please,\nfor, to say truth, I'm rather anxious on this point.  I feel that we\nshould never get on without a good interpreter.\"\n\nTo our satisfaction we found that the king was quite willing to do all\nthat we wished and a great deal more.  In fact, we soon perceived that\nhe felt highly honoured by our visit, and had boasted not a little of\n\"_his white men_\" to the chiefs of neighbouring tribes, some of whom had\ncome a considerable distance to see us.\n\n\"You have made quite a conquest, gentlemen, of worthy Jambai,\" said the\ntrader, after translating the king's favourable reply.  \"The fact is he\nis pleased with the liberality you have shown towards him in the way of\ngifts, and is proud of the confidence you have placed in him.  Had you\nbeen bent on a trading expedition, he would have opposed your further\nprogress; but knowing that you are simply hunters, he is anxious to\nassist you by all the means at his command.  He is surprised, indeed, at\nyour taking so much trouble and coming so far merely to kill wild\nanimals, for he cannot understand the idea of sporting.  He himself\nhunts for the sake of procuring meat.\"\n\n\"Can he not understand,\" said Peterkin, \"that _we_ hunt for fun?\"\n\n\"No, he don't quite see through that.  He said to me a few minutes ago,\n`Have these men no meat at home, that they come all this long way to get\nit?'  I told him that you had plenty, and then endeavoured to explain\nyour idea of hunting `for fun.'  But he shook his head, and I think he\ndoes not believe you.\"\n\nAt this point in our conversation the king rose and gave the signal to\nset out on the hunting expedition.  Instantly the whole population of\nthe town turned out and rushed to the banks of the river, near which it\nstood, where canoes were prepared for us.  Suddenly there arose a great\nshout, and the name \"Makarooroo, Makarooroo,\" passed from mouth to\nmouth.  Presently a fine, tall, deep-chested and broad-shouldered negro\nstepped up to the king and laid a leopard skin at his feet, while the\npeople shouted and danced with delight at the success of their\ncompanion; for, as I have already stated, it is deemed a bold feat to\nattack and slay a leopard single-handed.\n\nWhile the commotion caused by this event was going on, I said to the\ntrader--\n\n\"How comes it that Makarooroo can speak English?\"\n\n\"He spent a couple of years on the coast, in the service of a\nmissionary, and during that time attended the missionary school, where\nhe picked up a smattering of English and a trifle of geography and\narithmetic; but although a stout, sturdy hunter, and an intelligent man,\nhe was a lazy student, and gave the good missionary much trouble to\nhammer the little he knows into his thick skull.  At last he grew tired\nof it, and returned to his tribe; but he brought his Bible with him, and\nI am told is very diligent in the study of it.  His education has gained\nfor him a great reputation as a fetishman, or doctor of mysteries, among\nhis people.  I used often to see him at school hammering away at m-a,\nma-b-a, ba, and so on, amid a group of children.  He used to sit beside\nthe king--\"\n\n\"The king!\" said I, in surprise.\n\n\"Ay; the king of that district became a Christian, and he and the queen,\nwith one or two others of the royal household, used to attend school\nwith the children every day, and their diligence in studying the A B C\nwas beyond all praise.  But they were terribly stupid.  The children\nbeat them easily, showing how true is the saying that `youth is the time\nto learn.'  The king was always booby, and Makarooroo was always beside\nhim.\"\n\nAs the trader spoke, Makarooroo came forward and shook hands with him in\nthe English fashion.  He was then introduced to us, and expressed his\nwillingness to become our interpreter in somewhat curious but quite\ncomprehensible English.  As I looked at his intelligent, good-natured\ncountenance, I could not help thinking that the trader had underrated\nhis intellectual powers.\n\n\"He's a funny dog that Makarooroo,\" said Peterkin, as our interpreter\nhastened away to fetch his rusty old gun and spears; for he meant to\njoin our hunting expedition, although he had only that moment arrived\nfrom a long and fatiguing chase.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Jack.\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" said I; \"to me he seems rather of a grave and\nquiet disposition.\"\n\n\"O Ralph, what a bat you are!  He was grave enough just now, truly; but\ndid you not observe the twinkle in his eye when he spoke to us in\nEnglish?  Depend on it he's a funny dog.\"\n\n\"There must be freemasonry, then, among funny dogs,\" I retorted, \"for\nJack and I don't perceive it.\"\n\n\"Is this our canoe?\" inquired Jack of the trader.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Then let's jump in.\"\n\nIn a few seconds the river was crowded with a fleet of small canoes, and\nwe all paddled quickly up the stream, which was sluggish at that part.\nWe did not intend to proceed more than a few miles by water, as the\nplace where game was expected was at some distance from the river.  I\nfelt some regret at this, for the trip up the river was to me most\nenchanting.\n\nEvery yard we advanced new beauties of scenery were revealed to view.\nThe richness of the tropical vegetation seemed in this place to\nculminate, it was so rank and gorgeous.  The day was fine, too, and all\nthe strange-looking creatures--ugly and beautiful, large and small--\npeculiar to those regions, seemed to have resolved on a general peace in\norder to bask in the sunshine and enjoy the glorious weather.  Man alone\nwas bent on war, and our track, alas! was marked with blood wherever we\npassed along.  I pondered much on this subject, and wondered at the\nbloodthirsty spirit which seems to be natural to man in all conditions\nand climes.  Then I thought of the difficulty these poor Africans have\nat times in procuring food, the frequency with which they are reduced\nalmost to a state of starvation, and I ceased to wonder that they shot\nand speared everything that came in their way.\n\nWe proceeded up the left bank of the river, keeping close in to the\nshore in order to obtain the protection of the overhanging boughs and\nfoliage; for the sun soon began to grow hot, and in the middle of the\nday became so intense that I sometimes feared that I or my companions\nwould receive a sunstroke.  I confess that the subject of health often\ncaused me much anxiety; for although I knew that we were all old\nexperienced travellers--though young in years--and had become in a great\ndegree inured to hardships, I feared that the deadly climate of Central\nAfrica might prove too much for our European constitutions.  By the free\nuse of quinine, however, and careful attention to the roles of health as\nfar as circumstances would permit, we were fortunate enough to keep in\nexcellent health and spirits during the whole course of our sojourn\nthere; for which, when I thought of the hundreds of Europeans who had\nperished on that deadly coast without even venturing into the interior,\nI felt very thankful.  One of our chief delights, to which I in a great\ndegree attribute our uninterrupted health, was bathing daily in the\nstreams and ponds with which we fell in, or on which we paddled during\nour travels.  On these occasions we were fain, however, to be exceeding\ncareful in the selection of our bathing-pool, as crocodiles and\nalligators, and I know not what other hideous animals, were constantly\non the lookout for prey, and I make no doubt would have been very ready\nto try the flavour of a morsel of English food had we given them the\nchance.\n\nOn these occasions, when we had made sure of our pool, we were wont to\npaddle about in the cool refreshing stream, and recall to mind the\nsplendid dips we had had together six years before in the clear waters\nof the coral island.  Since that time Peterkin had learned to swim well,\nwhich was not only a source of much satisfaction and gratification to\nhimself now, but, he told me, had been the means of preserving not only\nhis own life on more than one occasion, but the life of a little child\nwhich he had the good fortune to rescue from drowning when cruising off\nthe island of Madagascar.\n\nPeterkin used to speak very strongly when talking on this subject, and I\nobserved, from the unusual seriousness of his manner, that he felt\ndeeply too.\n\n\"Ralph,\" he said to me one day, \"half the world is mad--I am not sure\nthat I might not say three-quarters of the world is mad--and I'm quite\ncertain that all the _ladies_ in the world are mad with the exception of\nthe brown ladies of the South Seas, and a few rare specimens elsewhere;\nthey're all mad together in reference to the matter of swimming.  Now\nthat I have learned it nothing is so easy, and any one who is not as\nblind as a rheumatic owl must see that nothing is more important; for\nevery one almost is subject to being pitched now and then into deep\nwater, and if he can't swim it's all up with him.  Why, every time an\nangler goes out to _fish_ he runs the chance of slipping and being swept\ninto a deep hole, where, if he cannot swim, he is certain to be drowned.\nAnd yet five strokes would save his life.  _Good_ swimming is by no\nmeans what is wanted; swimming of any kind, however poor, is all that is\ndesiderated.  Every time a lady goes to have a row on a lake she is\nliable to be upset by the clumsiness of those who accompany her, and\nalthough it may be close to shore, if she cannot swim, down she goes to\nthe bottom.  And _floating_ won't do.  Some ladies delude themselves\nwith the idea that floating is of great value.  In nine cases out of ten\nit is of no value at all; for unless water be perfectly smooth and\nstill, a person cannot float so as to keep the waves from washing over\nthe face, in which case choking is the certain result.  There is no\nexcuse for not learning to swim.  In most large cities there are\nswimming-baths; if the sea is not available, a river is, everywhere.  I\ntell you what it is, Ralph: people who don't learn to swim are--are--I\nwas going to say asses, but that would be an insult to the much-maligned\nlong-eared animal; and parents who don't teach their offspring to swim\ndeserve to be drowned in butter-milk; and I wish I saw--no, I _don't_\nquite wish I saw them all drowned in that way, but I do wish that I\ncould impress upon mankind over the length and breadth of this rotund\nworld the great, the immense, the intense importance of boys _and girls_\nbeing taught to swim.\"\n\n\"You make use of strong language,\" said I.\n\n\"Quite a powerful orator,\" added Jack, laughing.\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed Peterkin; \"your reception of this grand truth is but a\ntype of the manner in which it will be received by the pig-headed world.\nWhat's the use of preaching common sense?  I'm a perfect donkey!\"\n\n\"Nay, Peterkin,\" said Jack; \"I appreciate what you say, and have no\ndoubt whatever that your remarks, if made public, would create quite a\nrevolution in the juvenile world, and convert them speedily into aquatic\nanimals.  Did you ever think of sending your views on that subject to\nthe _Times_?\"\n\n\"The _Times_!\" cried Peterkin.\n\n\"Yes, the _Times_; why not?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Peterkin slowly, \"I once sent a letter to that great but\ninsolent periodical, and what do you think it did?\"\n\n\"Can't tell, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"_Took no notice of it whatever_!\" said Peterkin, with a look of\nineffable disgust.\n\nBut to return from this digression.  I was much struck with the splendid\ncontrast of colours that met my eye everywhere here.  The rich variety\nof greens in the different trees harmonised with the bright pink plums\nand scarlet berries, and these latter were almost dimmed in their lustre\nby the bright plumage of the birds, which I felt intense longing to\nprocure, many of them being quite new to me, and, I am certain, totally\nunknown to naturalists, while others I recognised with delight as\nbelonging to several of the species of which I had read in\nornithological works.  I tried hard to shoot several of these lovely\ncreatures, intending to stuff them, but, to my regret, was utterly\nunable to hit them.  Seeing this, Peterkin took pity on me, and sitting\ndown in the bow of our canoe, picked off all the birds I pointed out to\nhim as we passed, with unerring precision.  Most of them fell into the\nwater, and were easily secured, while one or two toppled off the\nbranches into the canoe.  Several of them he shot on the wing--a feat\nwhich even filled Jack with surprise, and so astounded the natives that\nthey surrounded our canoe at last, and gazed open-mouthed at my friend,\nwhom they evidently regarded as the greatest fetishman that had ever\ncome amongst them.\n\nHe was obliged to stop at last and lay down his gun in order to make the\nnatives cease from crowding round us and delaying our voyage.  A number\nof iguanas were observed on the branches of the trees that overhung the\nstream.  They dropped into the water as we approached; but the natives\nsucceeded in spearing a good many, and I afterwards found that they\nconsidered them excellent food.\n\nIf I was charmed with the birds, Peterkin was no less delighted with the\nmonkeys that chattered at us as we passed along.  I never saw a man\nlaugh as he did that day.  He almost became hysterical, so much was he\ntickled with their antics; and the natives, who have a keen sense of the\nludicrous, seemed quite to sympathise with his spirit, although, of\ncourse, what amused him could not have similarly affected them, seeing\nthat they were used to monkeys from infancy.\n\n\"There's something new!\" exclaimed Jack, as we rounded a bend in the\nriver and came in view of an open flat where it assumed somewhat the\naspect of a pond or small lake.  He pointed to a flock of birds standing\non a low rock, which I instantly recognised to be pelicans.\n\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"pelicans are not new to you!\"\n\n\"Certainly not; but if you look a little more attentively, I think you\nwill find material for your note-book.\"\n\nJack was right.  I observed a very fine fish-hawk circling over the head\nof one of the pelicans.  Its head and neck were white, and its body was\nof a reddish chocolate colour.  Just as we came in sight, the pelican\ncaught a fine fish, which it stowed away safe in the pouch under its\nchin.  The sly hawk, which had been watching for this, immediately made\na descent towards its victim, making a considerable noise with its wings\nas it came down.  Hearing this, the pelican looked hastily up, and\nsupposing that a terrible and deadly assault was about to be made,\nopened its mouth and screamed in terror.  This was just what the hawk\nwanted.  The open bill revealed the fish in the pouch.  Down he swooped,\nsnatched it out, and then soared away with his ill-gotten gains in his\ntalons.\n\n\"Oh, what a thief!\" exclaimed Peterkin.\n\n\"And the pelican seems to take his loss in a remarkably philosophical\nmanner,\" observed Jack.\n\nTo my surprise the great stupid bird, instead of flying away, as I had\nexpected, quietly resumed his fishing as if nothing had happened.  No\ndoubt he was well pleased to find himself still alive, and it is not\nimprobable that the hawk made several more meals at the expense of his\nlong-beaked friend after we had passed by.\n\nWe soon put him to flight, however, by landing near the spot where he\nstood, this being the place where we were to quit our canoes and pass\nthrough the jungle on foot.  The hunters now prepared themselves for\naction, for the recent tracks of elephants were seen on the bank of the\nstream, and the natives said they could not be far off.  Jack and\nPeterkin were armed with immensely heavy rifles, which carried balls of\nthe weight of six-ounces.  I carried my trusty, double-barrelled\nfowling-piece, which is of the largest size, and which I preferred to a\nrifle, because, not being a good shot, I resolved, on all occasions, to\nreserve my fire until we should come to close quarters with game,\nleaving my more expert comrades to take the longer shots.  We had also\ntwo natives--one being our guide, Makarooroo, who carried Jack and\nPeterkin's double-barrelled guns as a reserve.  These were loaded, of\ncourse, with ball.\n\n\"This looks something like business,\" said Jack, as he leaned on his\nheavy rifle and looked at the natives, who were selecting their spears\nand otherwise making preparations.\n\n\"It does,\" replied Peterkin.  \"Are you loaded?\"\n\n\"Ay, and I have just examined the caps to see that they are dry; for\nit's not like grouse-shooting on the Scottish hills this African\nhunting, depend upon it.  A snapping cap might cost us our lives,--\nRalph, my boy, you must keep well in rear.  I don't want to hurt your\nfeelings, but it won't do to go in front when you cannot depend on your\nnerves.\"\n\nI experienced a feeling of sadness not unmingled with shame as my friend\nsaid this, but I could not question the justness of his remark, and I\nknew well that he would not have made it at all, but for his anxiety\nlest I should run recklessly into danger, which I might find myself,\nwhen too late, unable to cope with.  I was careful, however, to conceal\nmy feelings as I replied with a smile--\n\n\"You are right, Jack.  I shall act the part of a support, while you and\nPeterkin skirmish in advance.\"\n\n\"And be careful,\" said Peterkin, solemnly, \"that you don't fire into us\nby mistake.\"\n\nSomewhat of Peterkin's own spirit came over me as I replied, \"Indeed, I\nhave been thinking of that, and I'm not sure that I can restrain myself\nwhen I see a chimpanzee monkey and a gorilla walking through the woods\nbefore me.\"\n\n\"I think we'd better take his gun from him,\" suggested Jack.\n\nAt this moment the king gave the signal to advance, so we shouldered our\nweapons and joined him.  As we walked rapidly along, Jack suggested that\nwe should allow the natives to kill any elephants we might fall in with\nin their own way, so as to observe how they managed it, rather than try\nto push ourselves forward on this our first expedition.  We all agreed\nto this, and shortly after we came to the place which elephants were\nknown to frequent.\n\nHere great preparations had evidently been made for them.  A space of\nmore than a mile was partially enclosed by what might be termed a vine\nwall.  The huge, thorny, creeping vines had been torn down from the\ntrees and woven into a rude sort of network, through which it was almost\nimpossible for any animal except an elephant to break.  This was\nintended--not to stop the elephant altogether, but to entangle and\nretard him in his flight, until the hunters could kill him with their\nspears.  The work, we were given to understand, was attended with\nconsiderable danger, for some of the natives were occasionally caught by\nthe thorny vines when flying from the charge of the infuriated animal,\nand were instantly stamped to death by his ponderous feet.\n\nI felt a new and powerful excitement creep over me as I saw the natives\nextend themselves in a wide semicircle of nearly two miles in extent,\nand begin to advance with loud shouts and cries, in order to drive the\ngame towards the vines, and the flashing eyes and compressed lips of my\ntwo companions showed that they were similarly affected.  We determined\nto keep together and follow close on that part of the line where the\nking was.\n\n\"You no be 'fraid?\" said Makarooroo, looking down at Peterkin, who, he\nevidently supposed, was neither mentally nor physically adapted for an\nAfrican hunter.\n\nPeterkin was so tickled with the question that he suddenly began to\ntremble like an aspen leaf, and to chatter with his teeth and display\nall the symptoms of abject terror.  Pointing over Makarooroo's shoulder\ninto the bush behind him, he gasped, \"The leopard!\"\n\nThe negro uttered a hideous yell, and springing nearly his own height\ninto the air, darted behind a tree with the agility of a wild-cat.\n\nInstantly Peterkin resumed his composure, and turning round with a look\nof cool surprise, said--\n\n\"What! you're not afraid, Makarooroo?\"  The good-humoured fellow burst\ninto a loud laugh on perceiving the practical joke that had been passed\non him, and it was evident that the incident, trifling though it was,\nhad suddenly raised his estimation of Peterkin to a very exalted pitch.\n\nWe now began to draw near to the enclosure, and I was beginning to fear\nthat our hunt was to prove unsuccessful that day.  A considerable\nquantity of small game had passed us, alarmed by the cries of the\nnatives; but we purposely withheld our fire, although I saw that Jack\nwas sorely tempted once or twice, when several beautiful gazelles and\none or two wild pigs ran past within shot.  Presently we heard a shrill\ntrumpeting sound, which Peterkin, who had hunted in the forests of\nCeylon, told us, in an excited voice, was the cry of the elephant.  We\nhastened forward with our utmost speed, when suddenly we were brought to\na stand by hearing a tremendous roar close in front of us.  Immediately\nafter, a large male lion bounded from among the bushes, and with one\nstroke of his enormous paw struck down a negro who stood not twenty\nyards from us.  The terrible brute stood for an instant or two, lashing\nhis sides with his tail and glaring defiance.  It chanced that I\nhappened to be nearest to him, and that the position of the tangled\nunderwood prevented my companions from taking good aim; so without\nwaiting for them, being anxious to save, if possible, the life of the\nprostrate negro, I fired both barrels into the lion's side.  Giving\nutterance to another terrible roar, he bounded away into the bush,\nscattering the negroes who came in his way, and made his escape, to our\ngreat disappointment.\n\nWe found, to our horror, on going up to the fallen hunter, that he was\nquite dead.  His skull had been literally smashed in, as if it had\nreceived a blow from a sledge-hammer.\n\nI cannot describe my feelings on beholding thus, for the first time, the\nking of beasts in all the savage majesty of strength and freedom,\ncoupled with the terrible death of a human being.  My brain was in a\nwhirl of excitement; I scarce knew what I was doing.  But I had no time\nto think, for almost immediately after firing the shots at the lion, two\nelephants came crashing through the bushes.  One was between ten and\neleven feet high, the other could not have been less than twelve feet.\nI had never seen anything like this in the menageries of England, and\ntheir appearance, as they burst thus suddenly on my vision, was\nsomething absolutely appalling.\n\nThose who have only seen the comparatively small and sluggish animals\nthat are wont to ring their bells to attract attention, and to feed on\ngingerbread nuts from the hands of little boys, can form no idea of the\nterrible appearance of the gigantic monsters of Africa as they go\ntearing in mad fury through the forests with their enormous ears, and\ntails, and trunks erect, their ponderous tusks glistening in the\nsunshine, and their wicked little eyes flashing like balls of fire as\nthey knock down, rend asunder, and overturn all that comes in their way.\n\nThe two that now approached us in full career were flying before a crowd\nof negroes who had already fixed a number of spears in their sides, from\nwhich the blood was flowing copiously.  To say that the bushes went down\nbefore them like grass would not give a correct idea of the ponderous\nrush of these creatures.  Trees of three and four inches diameter were\nrun against and snapped off like twigs, without proving in any degree\nobstructive.\n\nBy this time the negroes had crowded in from all sides, and as the\nelephants approached the place where we stood, a perfect cloud of spears\nand javelins descended on their devoted sides.  I observed that many of\nthe active natives had leaped up into the trees and discharged their\nspears from above, while others, crouching behind fallen trees or\nbushes, threw them from below, so that in a few seconds dozens of spears\nentered their bodies at every conceivable angle, and they appeared as if\nsuddenly transformed into monstrous porcupines or hedgehogs.  There was\nsomething almost ludicrous in this, but the magnitude and aspect of the\nanimals were too terrible, and our danger was too imminent, to permit\nanything like comic ideas to enter our brains.  I observed, too, that\nthe natives were perfectly wild with excitement.  Their black faces\nworked convulsively, and their white eyes and teeth glittered as they\nleaped and darted about in a state of almost perfect nudity, so that\ntheir aspect was quite demoniacal.\n\nThe suddenness and violence of the attack made near to us had the effect\nof turning the elephants aside, and the next instant they were tearing\nand wrenching themselves through the meshes of the tough and thorny\nvines.  The natives closed in with wild cries and with redoubled energy.\nNothing surprised me so much as to observe the incredible number of\nspears that were sticking all over these creatures, and the amount of\nblood that they lost, without any apparent diminution of strength\nresulting.  It seemed as if no human power could kill them, and at that\nmoment I almost doubted Peterkin's assertion that he had, while in\nCeylon, actually killed elephants with a single ball.\n\nWhile Jack and Peterkin and I were gazing in deep interest and surprise\nat the curious struggle going on before us, and holding ourselves in\nreadiness to act, should there be any chance of our game escaping, the\nlarger of the two elephants succeeded in disentangling himself by\nbacking out of the snare.  He then wheeled round and charged straight at\nKing Jambai, who stood close to us, with incredible fury.  The beast, as\nit came on with the bristling spears all over it, the blood spirting\nfrom its innumerable wounds, and trumpeting shrill with rage, seemed to\nme like some huge unearthly phantom.  It was with difficulty I could\nbelieve the whole scene other than a hideous dream.  Jambai launched his\njavelin into the animal's chest, and then turned and fled.  The other\nnatives also darted and scattered hither and thither, so that the\nelephant could not make up its mind on which of its enemies to wreak its\nvengeance.  We, too, turned and took to our heels at once with right\ngood will.  All at once I heard Jack utter a wild shout or yell, very\nunlike to anything I ever heard from him before.  I looked back, and saw\nthat his foot had got entangled in a thorny shrub, and that the elephant\nwas making at him.\n\nTo this day I have never been able to account for the remarkable\ncondition of mind and body that ensued on this occasion.  Instead of\nbeing paralysed as I had been when Peterkin was in imminent danger, all\nsensation of fear or hesitancy seemed to vanish on thine instant.  I\nfelt my nerves and muscles strung, as it were, and rendered firm as a\nrock, and with calm deliberation, yet with the utmost rapidity of which\nI was capable, I turned round, sprang between Jack and the enraged\nbeast, and presented my piece at his head.\n\n\"Right in the centre of his forehead,\" gasped Jack, as he endeavoured to\nwrench his foot from the entanglement.\n\nAt that moment I observed Peterkin leap to my side; the next instant the\nreport of both our guns rang through the woods; the elephant bounded\ncompletely over Jack, as Peterkin and I leaped to either side to let it\npass, and fell to the ground with such violence that a tree about six\ninches thick, against which it struck, went down before it like a willow\nwand.\n\nWe immediately assisted Jack to extricate himself; but we had no time to\ncongratulate ourselves on our narrow escape, for mingled shouts and\nyells from the men in the bushes ahead apprised us that some new danger\nmenaced them in that direction.\n\nReloading as fast as we could, we hastened forward, and soon gained the\nnew scene of battle.  Here stood the other elephant, trying to break\ndown a small tree up which King Jambai had climbed, partly for safety\nand partly in order to dart a javelin down on the brute as it passed.\n\nThis was a common custom of the natives; but the king, who was a bold,\nreckless man, had neglected to take the very necessary precaution of\nselecting a strong tree.  The elephant seemed actually to have observed\nthis, for instead of passing on, it suddenly rushed headlong against the\ntree and began to break it down.  When we came up the beast was heaving\nand straining with all its might, the stout tree was cracking and\nrending fearfully, so that the king could scarcely retain his position\non it.  The natives were plying their spears with the utmost vigour; but\nalthough mortally wounded, it was evident that in a few more seconds the\nelephant would succeed in throwing down the tree and trample the king to\ndeath.\n\nPeterkin instantly sprang forward, but Jack laid his hand on his\nshoulder.\n\n\"It's my turn this time, lad,\" he cried, and leaping towards the\nmonster, he placed the muzzle of his rifle close to its shoulder and\nsent a six-ounce ball right through its heart.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous.  The elephant fell to the ground, a\nmountain of dead flesh.\n\nThe delight of the negroes at this happy termination of the battle was\nexcessive.  They leaped and laughed and danced like insane men, and we\nhad much ado to prevent them seizing us in their arms and rubbing noses\nwith us.\n\nAs we had not commenced the hunt until well on in the day, evening was\nnow closing in; so the king gave orders to encamp on a dry rising ground\nnot far distant, where the jungle was less dense, and thither we all\nrepaired, the natives bringing in all the game, and cutting up the\nelephants in a very short space of time.\n\n\"Your shot was not such a bad one this time, Ralph,\" observed Peterkin,\nas we three stood looking at the large elephant which the natives were\ncutting up.  \"There they are, just above the proboscis.  But let me warn\nyou never again to venture on such a foolhardy thing as to fire in the\nface of a charging elephant unless you are a dead shot.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Peterkin, for your advice, which, however, I will not take\nwhen a comrade's life may depend on my doing so.\"\n\n\"I give you full credit for the excellence of your intention,\" rejoined\nmy friend; \"but if Jack's life had depended on those two shots from your\ndouble-barrel, he would have been but a dead man now.  There is only one\nvulnerable spot in the front of an elephant's head; that is, exactly in\nthe centre of the forehead.  The spot is not bigger than a saucer, and\nthe bone is comparatively thin there.  If you cannot make _sure_ of\nhitting that, you simply face certain death.  I would not have tried it\non any account whatever, had I not seen that both you and Jack would\nhave been killed had I not done so.\"\n\nOn examination we found that the heavy ball from Peterkin's rifle had\nindeed penetrated the exact spot referred to, and had been the means of\nkilling the elephant, while my two bullets were found embedded in the\nbone.\n\nThe tusks of this animal were magnificent.  I do not know what their\nexact weight was, not having the means wherewith to weigh them.  They\nwere probably worth a considerable sum of money in the British market.\nOf course we did not lay claim to any part of the spoil of that day,\nwith the exception of a few of the beautiful birds shot on the voyage up\nthe river, which were of no value to the natives, although priceless to\nme.  Alas! when I came to examine them next morning, I found that those\ndestructive creatures the white ants had totally destroyed the greater\npart of them, and the few that were worth stuffing were very much\ndamaged.\n\nExperience is a good though sometimes a severe teacher.  Never again did\nI, after that, put off the stuffing of any valuable creature till the\nnext day.  I always stuffed it in the evening of the day on which it was\nkilled; and thus, although the practice cost me many a sleepless night,\nI preserved, and ultimately brought home, many specimens of rare and\nbeautiful birds and beasts, which would otherwise have been destroyed by\nthose rapacious insects.\n\nThat night the scene of our camp was indescribably romantic and wild.\nNumerous huge fires were lighted, and round these the negroes circled\nand cooked elephant and venison steaks, while they talked over the\nevents of the day or recounted the adventures of former hunts with noisy\nvolubility and gesticulation.\n\nThe negro has a particular love for a fire.  The nights in his warm\nclimate are chill to him, though not so to Europeans, and he luxuriates\nin the heat of a fire as a cat does in the rays of the sun.  The warm\nblaze seems to draw out his whole soul, and causes his eyes to sparkle\nwith delight.  A good supper and a warm fire render him almost perfectly\nhappy.  There is but one thing wanting to render him supremely so, and\nthat is--a pipe!  No doubt, under similar circumstances, the white man\nalso is in a state of enviable felicity, but he does not show his joy\nlike the negro, who seems to forget his cares and sorrows, the miseries\nwhich his gross superstitions entail on him, the frequency with which he\nis exposed to sudden destruction; everything, in short, is forgotten\nsave the present, and he enjoys himself with unmitigated fervour.\n\nIt really did my heart good as I sat with my comrades beside our fire\nand looked around me on their happy faces, which were rendered still\nhappier by the gift from us of a small quantity of tobacco, with which\nwe had taken care to provide ourselves for this very purpose.\n\nI could scarcely believe that the jovial, kindly, hearty fellows were\nthe very men who are well-known to be such cruel, bloodthirsty fiends\nwhen under the influence of their dreadful superstitions, and who, but a\nfew hours before, had been darting through the woods besmeared with\nblood and yelling like maniacs or demons.  In fact, the whole scene\nbefore me, and the day's proceedings, seemed to me, at that time, like a\nvivid dream instead of a reality.  Moreover, after I lay down, the\nreality became a dream, and I spent that night, as I had spent the day,\nshooting gazelles, lions, wild pigs, and elephants in imagination.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nDREAMING AND FEEDING AND BLOODY WORK ENLARGED UPON.\n\nThe first object of which my senses became cognisant on awaking next\nmorning was my friend Peterkin, who had evidently awakened just a moment\nor two before me, for he was in the act of yawning and rubbing his eyes.\n\nI have all my life been a student of character, and the most interesting\nyet inexplicable character which I have ever studied has been that of my\nfriend Peterkin, whose eccentricities I have never been able fully to\nunderstand or account for.  I have observed that, on first awaking in\nthe mornings, he has been wont to exhibit several of his most eccentric\nand peculiar traits, so I resolved to feign myself asleep and watch him.\n\n\"Heigh-ho!\" he exclaimed, after the yawn I have just referred to.\nHaving said this, he stretched out both arms to the utmost above his\nhead, and then flung himself back at full length on his couch, where he\nlay still for about half a minute.  Then he started up suddenly into a\nsitting posture and looked slowly from one to another of the recumbent\nforms around him.  Satisfied, apparently, that they were asleep, he gave\nvent to a long yawn which terminated in a gasp, and then he looked up\ncontemplatively at the sky, which was at that hour beginning to warm\nwith the red rays of the rising sun.  While thus engaged, he caressed\nwith his right hand the very small scrap of whisker that grew on his\nright cheek.  At first it seemed as if this were an unconscious action,\nbut he suddenly appeared to become absorbed in it, and stared straight\nbefore him as one does when only half awake, mumbling the while in an\nundertone.  I could not make out distinctly what he said, but I think I\ncaught the words, \"Yes, a little--a _very_ little thicker--six new\nhairs, I think--umph! slow, very slow.\"  Here he looked at Jack's bushy\nbeard and sighed.\n\nSuddenly he thrust both hands deep into his breeches pockets and stared\nat the black embers of the extinct fire; then as suddenly he pulled out\nhis hands, and placing the forefinger of his right hand on the end of\nthe thumb of his left, said slowly--\n\n\"Let me see--I'll recall it.\"\n\nHe spoke with intense gravity.  Most persons do when talking to\nthemselves.\n\n\"Yes, I remember now.  There were two elephants and four--or three, was\nit?--no, it must have been four lions.  The biggest elephant had on a\nfalse front of fair curls and a marriage-ring on its tail.  Stay; was it\nnot the other one had that?  No, it was the biggest.  I remember now,\nfor it was just above the marriage-ring I grasped it when I pulled its\ntail out.  I didn't pull it off, for it wouldn't come off; it came out\nlike a telescope or a long piece of indiarubber.  Ha! and I remember\nthinking how painful it must be.  That was odd, now, to think of that.\nThe other elephant had on crinoline.  That was odder still; for of all\nanimals in the world it least required it.  Well, let me see.  What did\nI do?  Oh yes, I shot them both.  Of course, that was natural; but it\nwasn't quite so natural that the big one should vomit up a live lion,\nwhich attacked me with incredible fury.  But I killed it cleverly.  Yes,\nit _was_ a clever thing, undoubtedly, to split a lion in two, from the\ntip of its nose to the extremity of its tail, with one stroke of a\npenknife--\"\n\nAt this climax I could contain myself no longer, and burst into a loud\nlaugh as I perceived that Peterkin had spent the night, as I myself had\ndone, in hunting--though, I confess, there was a considerable difference\nin the nature of our achievements, and in the manner of their\naccomplishment.\n\n\"Why, what are you laughing at?\" said Jack, sitting up and gazing at me\nwith a stupid stare.\n\n\"At Peterkin's dreams,\" said I.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Jack, with a smiling yawn, \"that's it, is it?  Been hunting\nelephants and lions, eh?\"\n\n\"Why, how did you guess that?\"  I asked, in surprise; \"were you not\nasleep just now?\"\n\n\"Of course I was, and dreaming too, like yourself, I make no doubt.  I\nhad just bagged my fifteenth elephant and my tenth lion when your laugh\nawoke me.  And the best of it is that I was carrying the whole bagful on\nmy back at once, and did not feel much oppressed by the weight.\"\n\n\"That beats my dream hollow,\" observed Peterkin; \"so its my opinion we'd\nbetter have breakfast.--Makarooroo, hy! d'ye hear? rouse up, you junk of\nebony.\"\n\n\"Yis, massa, comin',\" said our guide, rising slowly from his lair on the\nopposite side of our fireplace.\n\n\"D'you hear?\"\n\n\"Yis, massa.\"\n\n\"You're a nigger!\"\n\n\"Dat am a fact.\"\n\n\"Well, being a nigger you're a brick, so look sharp with that splendid\nbreakfast you promised us last night.  I'll wager a million pounds that\nyou had forgotten all about it.\"\n\n\"No, massa, me no forgit.  Me up in centre ob de night and put 'im in de\nhole.  Wat you call 'im--oben?\"\n\n\"Ay, oven, that's it.\"\n\n\"Yis.  Well, me git 'im d'rec'ly.\"\n\n\"And, I say, hold on,\" added Peterkin.  \"Don't you suppose I'm going to\nstand on ceremony with you.  Your name's too long by half.  Too many\nrooroos about it, so I'm going to call you Mak in future, d'ye\nunderstand?\"\n\nThe negro nodded and grinned from ear to ear as he left us.  Presently\nhe returned with a huge round, or lump of meat, at which we looked\ninquisitively.  The odour from it was delightful, and the tender, juicy\nappearance of the meat when Makarooroo, who carved it for us, cut the\nfirst slice, was quite appetising to behold.\n\n\"What is it?\" inquired Peterkin.\n\n\"Elephant's foot,\" replied the guide.\n\n\"Gammon,\" remarked Peterkin.\n\n\"It's true, massa.  Don't you see him's toe?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Jack.\n\n\"And it's first-rate,\" cried I, tasting a morsel.\n\nWith that we fell to and made a hearty meal, after which we, along with\nthe king and all his people, retraced our steps to the river and\nreturned to the native town, where we spent another day in making\npreparations to continue our journey towards the land of the gorilla.\n\nDuring the hunt which I have just described I was very much amused as\nwell as amazed at the reckless manner in which the negroes loaded their\nrusty old trade-guns.  They put in a whole handful of powder each time,\nand above that as much shot and bits of old iron of all kinds as they\ndared; some I saw charged thus to within a few inches of the muzzle, and\nthe owners seemed actually afraid to put them to their shoulders, as\nwell they might be, for the recoil was tremendous, and had the powder\nbeen good their guns must have been blown to pieces and themselves\nkilled.\n\nOn our return to the village we found the people on the eve of one of\nthose terrible outbursts of superstitious passion which rarely if ever\npass away without some wretched human creature perishing under the hands\nof murderers.\n\n\"There is something wrong with the fetishman, I think,\" remarked Jack,\nas we disembarked at the landing.  \"He seems excited.  Do you know what\nit can be at, Makarooroo?\"\n\n\"Jack,\" interposed Peterkin, \"I have changed his name to Mak, so you and\nRalph will please to remember that.--Mak, my boy, what's wrong with your\ndoctor?\"\n\nThe negro looked very grave and shook his head as he replied, \"Don'\nknow, massa.  Him's be goin' to rizz de peepil wid him norrible doin's.\nDere will be death in the camp mos' bery quick--p'raps dis night.\"\n\n\"That is terrible,\" said I.  \"Are you sure of what you say?\"\n\n\"Sartin sure,\" replied the negro, with another shake of the head.\n\n\"Then, Mak,\" said Jack, \"it behoves us to look to ourselves.  You look\nlike an honest fellow, and I believe we may trust you.  We cannot expect\nyou to help us to fight against your own kith and kin, but I do expect\nthat you will assist us to escape if any foul play is intended.\nWhatever betides, it is as well that you should know that white men are\nnot easily conquered.  Our guns are good--they never miss fire.  We will\nsell our lives dearly, you may depend on it.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" added Peterkin, \"it is well that you should know that; moreover,\nit is well that the rascally niggers of your tribe should know it too;\nso you can take occasion to give them a hint that we shall keep\nourselves prepared for them, with my compliments.\"\n\n\"De mans ob my peepil,\" replied the negro, with some dignity of manner,\n\"be not wuss dan oder mans.  But dem is bad enuff.  But you no hab need\nfor be fraid.  Dey no touch de white mans.  Dem bery much glad you com'\nhere.  If any bodies be killed it be black mans or 'oomans.\"\n\nWe felt somewhat relieved on hearing this, for, to say truth, we knew\nwell enough that three men, no matter how well-armed or resolute they\nmight be, could not hope to defend themselves against a whole tribe of\nsavages in their own country.  Nevertheless we resolved to keep a sharp\nlookout, and be prepared for the worst.  Meanwhile we did all in our\npower to expedite our departure.\n\nThat evening the trader started on his return journey to the coast,\nleaving us in charge of King Jambai, who promised earnestly to take good\ncare of us.  We immediately put his willingness to fulfil his promise to\nthe test by begging him to furnish us with men to carry our goods into\nthe interior.  He tried very hard to induce us to change our minds and\nremain hunting with his tribe, telling us that the gorilla country was\nfar far away from his lands; that we should never reach it alive, or\nthat if we did we should certainly be killed by the natives, who,\nbesides being cruel and warlike, were cannibals; and that if we did meet\nin with gorillas we should all be certainly slain, for no one could\ncombat successfully with that ferocious giant of the monkey tribe.\n\nTo this we replied that we were quite aware of the dangers we should\nhave to encounter in our travels, but added that we had come there for\nthe very purpose of encountering such dangers, and especially to pay a\nvisit to the giant monkeys in their native land, so that it was in vain\nhis attempting to dissuade us, as we were resolved to go.\n\nSeeing that we were immovable, the king eventually gave in, and ordered\nsome of his best men to hold themselves in readiness to start with us on\nthe following morning.  We then proceeded to his majesty's house, where\nwe had supper, and afterwards retired to our own hut to rest.\n\nBut we were destined to have little or no rest that night.  The doctor\nor fetishman of the tribe had stirred up the passions of the people in a\nmanner that was quite incomprehensible to us.  King Jambai, it seems,\nhad been for some weeks suffering from illness--possibly from\nindigestion, for he was fond of gorging himself--and the medicine-man\nhad stated that his majesty was bewitched by some of the members of his\nown tribe, and that unless these sorcerers were slain there was no\npossibility of his getting well.\n\nWe never could ascertain why the fetishman should fix upon certain\npersons to be slain, unless it was that he had a personal enmity against\nthem; but this seemed unlikely, for two of the persons selected were old\nfemale slaves, who could never, of course, have injured the doctor in\nany way.  But the doings of Africans, especially in regard to religious\nsuperstitions, I afterwards found were so mysterious that no one could\nor would explain the meaning of them to us.  And I am inclined to\nbelieve that in reference to the meaning of many things they were\nthemselves utterly ignorant.\n\nTowards midnight the people had wrought themselves up to a frenzied\ncondition, and made so much noise that we could not sleep.  In the midst\nof the uproar Makarooroo, who we observed had been very restless all the\nevening, rushed into our hut, exclaiming, \"Massa! massa! come, save my\nOkandaga! come quick!\"\n\nThe poor fellow was trembling with anxiety, and was actually pale in the\nface; for a distinctly discernible pallor overspreads the countenance of\nthe negro when under the influence of excessive terror.\n\nOkandaga we had previously heard of and seen.  She was, according to\nAfrican notions, an exceedingly pretty young girl, with whom our worthy\nguide had fallen desperately in love.  Makarooroo's education had done\nmuch for him, and especially in regard to females.  Having observed the\nkind, respectful consideration with which the missionaries treated their\nwives, and the happiness that seemed to be the result of that course of\nconduct, he resolved in his own mind to try the experiment with one of\nthe girls of his own tribe, and soon after rejoining it paid his\nattentions to Okandaga, who seemed to him the most modest and lovable\ngirl in the village.\n\nPoor Okandaga was first amazed and then terrified at the strangely\ngentle conduct of her lover, and thought that he meant to bewitch her;\nfor having never before been accustomed to other than harsh and\ncontemptuous treatment from men, she could not believe that Makarooroo\nmeant her any good.  Gradually, however, she began to like this\nrespectful wooer, and finally she agreed to elope with him to the\nsea-coast and live near the missionaries.  It was necessary, however, to\narrange their plans with great caution.  There was no difficulty in\ntheir getting married.  A handsome present to the girl's father was all\nthat was necessary to effect that end, and a good hunter like Makarooroo\nknew he could speedily obtain possession of his bride, but to get her\nremoved from her tribe and carried to the coast was quite a different\naffair.  While the perplexed negro was pondering this subject and\nracking his brains to discover a way of getting over the difficulty, our\narrival at the village occurred.  At once he jumped to the conclusion\nthat somehow or other he should accomplish his object through our\nassistance; and holding this in view, he the more willingly agreed to\naccompany us to the gorilla country, intending first to make our\nacquaintance, and afterwards to turn us to account in furthering his\nplans.  All this we learned long afterwards.  At the period of which I\nam now writing, we were profoundly ignorant of everything save the fact\nthat Okandaga was his affianced bride, and that the poor fellow was now\nalmost beside himself with horror because the fetishman had condemned\nher, among others, to drink the poisoned cup.\n\nThis drinking of the poisoned cup is an ordeal through which the unhappy\nvictims to whom suspicion has been attached are compelled to pass.  Each\none drinks the poison, and several executioners stand by, with heavy\nknives, to watch the result.  If the poison acts so as to cause the\nsupposed criminal to fall down, he is hacked in pieces instantly; but\nif, through unusual strength or peculiarity of constitution, he is\nenabled to resist the effects of the poison, his life is spared, and he\nis declared innocent.\n\nJack and Peterkin and I seized our weapons, and hurrying out, followed\nour guide to the spot where this terrible tragedy was enacting.\n\n\"Don't fear, Mak,\" said Peterkin, as we ran along; \"we'll save her\nsomehow.  I'm certain of that.\"\n\nThe negro made no reply, but I observed a more hopeful expression on his\ncountenance after the remark.  He evidently had immense faith in\nPeterkin; which I must say was more than I had, for when I considered\nour small numbers, my hope of influencing savages was very slight.\n\nThe scene that met our eyes was indescribably horrible.  In the centre\nof a dense circle of negroes, who had wrought themselves up to a pitch\nof ferocity that caused them to look more like wild beasts than men,\nstood the king, and beside him the doctor or fetishman.  This latter was\nornamented with a towering headdress of feathers.  His face was painted\nwhite, which had the effect of imparting to him an infinitely more\nhideous and ghastly aspect than is produced in the white man when he is\npainted black.  A stripe of red passed round his head, and another down\nhis forehead and nose.  His naked body was decked with sundry fantastic\nornaments, and altogether he looked more like a fiend than I had\nbelieved it possible for man to appear.\n\nThe ground all round him was saturated with blood and strewn with arms,\nfingers, cleft skulls, and masses of flesh that had been hewn from the\nvictims who had already fallen, one of whom, we afterwards learned, had\nbelonged to the royal family.  Two still remained--a young female and an\nold man.  The emaciated frame and white woolly head of the latter showed\nthat in the course of nature his earthly career must soon terminate.  It\nis probable that the poor old man had become a burden to his relations,\nand the doctor took this opportunity of ridding the tribe of him.  The\ngirl was Okandaga, who stood weeping and trembling as she gazed upon the\nbutchery that had already taken place.\n\nThe old man had swallowed the poison shortly before we arrived, and he\nwas now struggling to maintain an erect position.  But he failed, his\nquivering limbs sank beneath him, and before we could interfere the\nbloody executioners had cut off his head, and then, in a transport of\npassion, they literally hacked his body to pieces.\n\nWe rushed hastily forward to the king, and Jack, in an earnest voice,\nimplored him to spare the last victim.\n\n\"Surely,\" said he, \"enough have been sacrificed already.--Tell him,\nMakarooroo, that I will quit his village and never see him more if he\ndoes not spare the life of that young girl.\"\n\nThe king appeared much perplexed by this unlooked-for interference on\nour part.\n\n\"I cannot check the spirits of my people now,\" he replied.  \"They are\nroused.  The girl has bewitched me and many others.  She must die.  It\nis our custom.  Let not my white men be offended.  Let them go to their\nhut and sleep.\"\n\n\"We cannot sleep while injustice is done in the village,\" answered Jack,\nin a lofty tone.  \"Let not King Jambai do that which will make his\nvisitors ashamed of him.  Let the girl live till to-morrow at midnight.\nLet the case be investigated, and if she be proved guilty then let her\ndie.\"\n\nThe king commenced a long reply in the same dignified manner and tone\nwhich Jack had assumed.  While he was thus engaged Peterkin touched our\nguide on the shoulder and whispered--\n\n\"I say, Mak, tell the doctor to back up Jack's request, and I'll give\nhim a gun.\"\n\nThe negro slipped at once to the side of the doctor, who had begun to\nfrown fiercely on Jack, and whispered a few words in his ear.  Instantly\nhis face assumed a calmer aspect, and presently he stepped up to the\nking, and a whispering conversation ensued, in which the doctor,\ncarefully refraining from making any mention of the gun, commended the\nwise advice of the white man, and suggested that the proposal should be\nagreed to, adding, however, that he knew for certain that the girl was a\nwitch, but that the investigation would do good in the way of proving\nthat he, the doctor, was correct, and thus the girl should perish on the\nfollowing night, and the white men would be satisfied.\n\nHaving announced this to the multitude, the king ordered Okandaga to be\nconducted back to her prison and carefully guarded; and we returned to\nour hut--not, however, to sleep, but to consult as to what was to be\ndone next.\n\n\"I knew that you wanted a respite for her,\" said Peterkin, as we sat\nround our fire, \"that you might have time to consider how to act, and I\nbacked up your request accordingly, as you know.  But now, I confess,\nI'm very much at a loss what to suggest.  It seems to me we have only\npurchased a brief delay.\"\n\n\"True,\" answered Jack.  \"The delay is not so brief, however, but that we\nmay plan some method of getting the poor girl out of this scrape.--What\nsay you, Mak?\"\n\n\"If _you_ no can tink 'pon someting, I gib up all hope,\" replied our\nguide sorrowfully.\n\n\"Come, Mak, cheer up,\" cried Peterkin.  \"If the worst comes to the\nworst, you can, at any rate, fight for your bride.\"\n\n\"Fight!\" exclaimed the negro, displaying his white teeth like a mastiff,\nrolling his eyes and clinching his fists convulsively.  Then in a calmer\ntone he continued, \"Ay, me can fight.  Me could kill all de guards an'\ntake Okandaga by de hand, an' run troo de bushes for eber.  But guards\nno die widout hollerin' an' yellerin' like de gorilla; an' nigger mans\ncan run fasterer dan womans.  No, no, dat am dumpossobable.\"\n\n\"Nothing's `dumpossobable' to brave hearts and stout arms,\" replied\nJack.  \"There are only four guards put over her, I believe.  Well, there\nare just four of us--not that we require to be equal, by any means.\nPeterkin and I could settle them easily; but we require to be equal in\nnumbers, in order to do it quietly.  I have a plan in my head, but\nthere's one hitch in it that I cannot unravel.\"\n\n\"And what may that be?\"  If asked.\n\n\"Why, I don't see how, after getting clear off with Okandaga, we are to\navoid being pursued on suspicion and captured.\"\n\n\"Dere is one cave,\" remarked the guide, \"not far off to here.  P'raps we\nbe safe if we git into 'im.  But I 'fraid it not do, cause him be\npeepiled by fiends an' dead man's spirits.\"\n\n\"That's a grave objection,\" said Peterkin, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, an' de tribe neber go near dere; dey is most drefful terrorfied to\nbe cotched dere.\"\n\n\"Then, that will just do,\" cried Jack, with animation.  \"The very thing.\nAnd now I'll tell you what my plan is.  To-morrow morning early we will\ntell the king that we wish to be off at once--that we have put off too\nmuch time already, and wish to make no further delay.  Then we'll pack\nup and start.  At night we will encamp in a quiet, out-of-the-way part\nof the woods, and slip back to the village in the dark a short time\nbefore midnight.  The whole village will at that time be assembled,\nprobably, at the spot where the execution is to take place; so we can\nrush in, overpower the guard, free Okandaga, and make our escape to the\ncave, where they will never think of looking for us.\"\n\nPeterkin shook his head.  \"There are two difficulties in your plan,\nJack.  First, what if the natives are _not_ assembled on the place of\nexecution, and we find it impossible to make our entrance into or exit\nfrom the village quietly?\"\n\n\"I propose,\" replied Jack, \"that we shall undress ourselves, rub\nourselves entirely over with charcoal and grease, so that they shall not\nrecognise us, and dash in and carry the girl off by a _coup de main_.\nIn which case it will, of course, be neck or nothing, and a tremendous\nrace to the cave, where, if they follow us, we will keep them at bay\nwith our rifles.\"\n\n\"Umph! dashing, no doubt, but risky,\" said Peterkin--\"extremely risky.\nYet it's worth trying.  Well, my second difficulty is--what if they\ndon't stick to their promise after we quit, and kill the poor thing\nbefore midnight?\"\n\n\"We must take our chance of that.  But I shall put the king on his\nhonour before leaving, and say that I will make particular inquiry into\nthe way in which the trial has been conducted on my return.\"\n\n\"Put the king on his honour!\" observed Peterkin.  \"I'm afraid that\nyou'll put his majesty on an extremely unstable foundation.  However, I\nsee nothing better that can be done.\"\n\n\"Have you any more difficulties?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.  \"There is one other.  What do you propose to do with the\nmen who are to be supplied us by the king during these extremely\ndelicate and difficult manoeuvres?\"\n\nThe countenances of my comrades fell at this question.\n\n\"I never thought of them,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Peterkin.\n\nMakarooroo groaned.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"if you will allow me to suggest, I would recommend that\nwe should, towards the close of the day, send them on ahead of us, and\nbid them encamp at a certain place, saying that we shall spend the night\nin hunting, and return to them in the morning.\"\n\n\"The very thing,\" said Jack.  \"Now, comrades, to rest.  I will occupy\nmyself until I fall asleep in maturing my plans and thinking out the\ndetails.  Do you the same, and if anything should occur to you let us\nconsult over it in the morning.\"\n\nWe were all glad to agree to this, being wearied more perhaps by\nexcitement than want of rest; so bidding each other good-night, we lay\ndown side by side to meditate, and for my part to dream of the difficult\nand dangerous work that awaited us on the morrow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nWE CIRCUMVENT THE NATIVES.\n\nWe arose on the following morning with the dawn of day, and began to\nmake preparation for our departure.\n\nTo our satisfaction we found the king quite willing that we should go;\nso embarking our goods in one of the native canoes, we ordered our\nnegroes to embark, and commenced our journey amid the firing of guns and\nthe good wishes of the natives.  I must confess that I felt some\nprobings of conscience at the thought of the double part we were\ncompelled to play; but the recollection of the horrid fate that awaited\nthe poor negro girl put to flight such feelings, and induced a longing\nfor the time of action to arrive.\n\nI have more than once referred to our goods.  Perhaps it may be as well\nto explain that, when we first landed on the African coast, we made\ninquiries of those who were best acquainted with the nature and\nrequirements of the country we were about to explore, as to what goods\nwe ought to purchase of the traders, in order to be in a position to pay\nour way as we went along; for we could not, of course, expect the\nsavages to feed us and lodge us and help us on our way for nothing.\nAfter mature consideration, we provided ourselves with a supply of such\nthings as were most necessary and suitable--such as tobacco, powder, and\nshot, and ball, a few trade-guns, several pieces of brightly-coloured\ncloth, packages of beads (some white enamelled, others of coloured\nglass), coffee and tea, knives, scissors, rings, and a variety of other\nknick-knacks.  These, with a little brandy to be used medicinally, our\nblankets and camp cooking utensils, formed a heavy load for ten men;\nbut, of course, as we advanced, the load was lightened by the\nconsumption of our provisions and the giving away of goods.  The\nadditions which I made, however, in the shape of stuffed specimens,\nbegan in the course of time to more than counterbalance this advantage.\n\nBeing resolved to impress the natives with a respect for our physical\npowers, we made a point of each carrying a pretty heavy load on our\njourneys--excepting, of course, when we went out a-hunting.  But to\nreturn.\n\nOur crew worked willingly and well, so that ere night closed in upon us\nwe were a considerable distance away from the village.  As the sun set\nwe landed, and ordering our men to advance in the canoe to a certain\nbend in the river, and there encamp and await our return, we landed and\nwent off into the woods as if to search for game.\n\n\"Now, Makarooroo, quick march, and don't draw rein till we reach the\ncave,\" said Jack when we were out of sight of the canoe.\n\nOur guide obeyed in silence, and for the next two hours we travelled\nthrough the woods at a sort of half trot that must have carried us over\nthe ground at the rate of five miles in hour.  The pace was indeed\ntremendous, and I now reaped the benefit of those long pedestrian\nexcursions which for years past I had been taking, with scientific ends\nin view, over the fields and hills of my native land.  Jack and Peterkin\nseemed both to be made of iron, and incapable of suffering from fatigue.\nBut I have no doubt that the exciting and hazardous nature of the\nexpedition on which we had embarked had much to do with our powers of\nendurance.\n\nAfter running and doubling, gliding and leaping through the dense woods,\nas I have said, for two hours, we arrived at a broken, rocky piece of\nground, over which we passed, and eventually came upon a thick jungle\nthat concealed a vast cliff almost entirely from view.  The cracking of\nthe bushes as we approached showed that we had disturbed the slumbers of\nmore than one of the wild beasts that inhabited the spot.  Here\nMakarooroo paused, and although it was intensely dark I could observe\nthat he was trembling violently.\n\n\"Come, Mak,\" said I in a whisper, \"surely you, who have received a\nChristian education, do not really believe that devils inhabit this\nspot?\"\n\n\"Me don know, massa.  Eber since me was be a pikaniny me 'fraid--\nhorrobably 'fraid ob dat cave.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Jack impatiently; \"we have no time for fears of any\nkind this night.  Think of Okandaga, Mak, and be a man.\"\n\nThis was sufficient.  The guide pushed boldly forward, and led us to the\nmouth of a large cavern, at which he halted and pointed to the gloomy\ninterior.\n\n\"You have the matches, Peterkin; quick, strike a light.  It is getting\nlate,\" said Jack.\n\nIn another moment a light was struck, and with it we kindled three\ngoodly-sized torches with which we had provided ourselves.  Holding\nthese high over our heads, we entered the cavern--Jack first, Peterkin\nsecond, I next, and the terrified negro in rear.\n\nWe had scarcely entered, and were peering upwards at the black vault\noverhead, when an indescribable rushing sound filled the air of the\ncavern, and caused the flame of our torches to flicker with such\nviolence that we could not see any object distinctly.  We all came to a\nsudden pause, and I confess that at that moment a feeling of\nsuperstitious dread chilled the blood in my veins.  Before we could\ndiscover the cause of this strange effect, several large black objects\npassed through the air near our heads with a peculiar muffled noise.\nNext instant the three torches were extinguished.\n\nUnable to command himself any longer, the negro uttered a cry of terror\nand turned to fly; but Jack, whose wits seemed always prepared for any\nemergency, had foreseen the probability of this, and springing quickly\nafter him, threw his arms round his neck and effectually prevented his\nrunning away.\n\nThe noise caused by the scuffle seemed to arouse the fury of all the\nevil spirits of the place, for a perfect hurricane of whirring sounds\nraged around us for a few seconds.\n\n\"It's only bats,\" cried Jack.--\"Look alive, Peterkin; another light.\"\n\nIn a few seconds the torches were rekindled, and we advanced into the\ncavern; and Mak, after recovering from his fright and learning the cause\nthereof, became much bolder.  The cave was about a hundred yards deep by\nabout fifty wide; but we could not ascertain its height, for the light\nof our torches failed to penetrate the deep gloom overhead.  It was\ndivided into two natural chambers, the outer being large, the inner\nsmall--a mere recess, in fact.  In this latter we planted our torches,\nand proceeded with our hasty preparations.  Peterkin was ready first.\nWe endeavoured to make ourselves as like to the natives in all respects\nas possible; and when I looked at my companions, I was obliged to\nconfess that, except in the full blaze of the torch-light, I could not\ndiscern any point of difference between them and our guide.\n\n\"Now then, Jack,\" said Peterkin, \"as you're not quite ready and I am, I\nshall employ myself in preparing a little plan of my own which I intend\nto put in force if the savages dare to venture into the cavern after\nus.\"\n\n\"Very good; but see that you finish it in less than five minutes, for\nI'll be ready in that time.\"\n\nPeterkin immediately poured out a large quantity of powder on a flat\nrock, and mingling with it a little water from a pool near by, converted\nit into a semi-moist ball.  This he divided into three parts, and\nforming each part into the shape of a tall cone, laid the whole\ncarefully aside.\n\n\"There!\" said he, \"lie you there until you are wanted.\"\n\nAt this moment, while Jack and I were bending down fastening the latchet\nof our shoes, our ears were saluted with one of the most appalling yells\nI ever listened to.  Makarooroo fell flat to the earth in his fright,\nand my own heart chilled with horror, while Jack sprang up and\ninstinctively grasped the handle of his hunting-knife.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Peterkin, as he stood laughing at us quietly, and we\nimmediately perceived that it was he who uttered the cry.\n\n\"Why, what mean you?\" said Jack, almost angrily.  \"Surely this is no\ntime for foolish jesting.\"\n\n\"I am anything but jesting, Jack.  I'm only rehearsing another part of\nmy plan.\"\n\n\"But you ought to give us warning when you are about to do such\nstartling things,\" said I remonstratively.\n\n\"Nay, that would not have done at all, because then I should not have\nknown what effect my cry is likely to produce on unexpectant ears.\"\n\n\"Well, now, are you all ready?\" inquired Jack.  \"Then let us go.\"\n\nIssuing forth armed only with our double-barrelled guns and heavy\nhunting-knives, we hastened towards the native village.  When within a\nhundred yards of the edge of the wood that skirted it we stopped to pull\noff our shoes, for it was necessary that we should have nothing about\nour persons to tell who we were should any one chance to see us as we\nran.  We also left our rifles beside the shoes at a spot where we could\nfind them in an instant in passing, and then slowly approached the\noutskirts of the village.\n\nPresently we heard the hum of distant voices shouting, and the fear that\nthe scene of bloodshed had already begun induced us to quicken our pace\nto a smart run.  I never saw a man so deeply affected as was our poor\nguide, and when I looked at him I felt extremely anxious lest his state\nof mind should unfit him for acting with needful caution.\n\nWe gained the first cottages--they were empty.  The village having been\nrecently built, no stockade had yet been thrown round it, so our\nprogress was unimpeded.\n\n\"We must be very cautious now,\" observed Jack in a whisper.--\"Restrain\nyourself, Makarooroo; Okandaga's life depends on our coolness.\"\n\nOn reaching the back of the next hut, which was also empty.  Jack\nmotioned to us to halt, and coming close to us looked earnestly in each\nof our faces without saying a word.  I supposed that, like a wise\ngeneral, he was reviewing his troops--seeing whether the men he was\nabout to lead into battle were fit for their work.\n\n\"Now,\" said he rapidly, \"it's evident from the shouting that's going on\nthat they won't waste much time with their palaver.  The hut in which\nshe is confined is not fifty yards off; I took care to ascertain its\nposition before leaving this morning.  What we have to do is simple.\nSpring on the guards and knock them down with our fists or the hilts of\nour hunting-knives, or with bits of stick, as suits us best.  But\n_mind_\"--here he looked pointedly at our guide--\"no shedding of blood if\nit can be avoided.  These men are not our enemies.  Follow me in single\nfile; when I halt, come up into line; let each single out the man\nnearest to him, and when I hold up my hand spring like wild-cats.  If\nthere happen to be five or six guards instead of four, leave the\nadditional ones to me.\"  We merely nodded assent, and in another minute\nwere close upon the prison.  Peterkin, Mak, and I had provided us with\nshort heavy bludgeons on our way.  These we held in our right hands; our\nleft hands we kept free either to grasp our opponents with, or to draw\nour knives if necessary.  Jack carried his long knife--it might almost\nhave been termed a short sword--in his left hand, and from the manner in\nwhich he clinched his right I saw that he meant to make use of it as his\nprincipal weapon.\n\nOn gaining the back of the house we heard voices within, but could see\nnothing, so we moved softly round to the front, keeping, however, well\nbehind the screen of bushes.  Here Jack halted, and we ranged up\nalongside of him and peeped through the bushes.  The hut was quite open\nin front and the interior was brightly lighted by a strong fire, round\nwhich the four guards--stout fellows all of them--were seated with their\nspears beside them on the ground.  They were conversing in an excited\ntone, and taking no notice of Okandaga, who sat behind them, partially\nin the shade, with her face buried in her hands.  She was not tied in\nany way, as the guards knew well enough that she could not hope to\nescape them by mere running way.\n\nOne rapid glance showed us all this, and enabled us to select our men.\nThen Jack gave the signal, and without an instant's hesitation we darted\nupon them.  I know not in what manner my comrades acted their part.\nFrom the moment I set eyes on the negro nearest to me, my blood began to\nboil.  Somehow or other I saw Jack give the signal without taking my\neyes off my intended victim, then I sprang forward, and he had barely\ntime to look up in alarm when I struck him with all my force on the\nright temple.  He fell without a groan.  I looked round instantly, and\nthere lay the other three, with my companions standing over them.  Our\nplan had been so well concerted and so promptly executed that the four\nmen fell almost at the same instant, and without a cry.\n\nPoor Okandaga leaped up and uttered a faint scream of alarm, but\nMakarooroo's voice instantly reassured her, and with an exclamation of\njoy she sprang into his arms.  There was no time for delay.  While the\nscene I have described was being enacted the shouts in the centre of the\nvillage had been increasing, and we guessed that in a few minutes more\nthe bloodthirsty executioners would come for their helpless victim.  We\ntherefore left the hut at once, and ran as fast as we could towards the\nplace where our guns and shoes had been left.  Our guide seized Okandaga\nby the wrist and dragged her along; but indeed she was so nimble that at\nfirst she required no assistance.  In a short time, however, we were\nobliged to slacken our pace in order to enable her to keep up.  We\nreached the guns in safety; but while we were in the act of lifting them\na burst of wild cries, that grew louder and fiercer as they approached,\ntold that the natives were rushing tumultuously towards the prison.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, \"we must put on full speed.--Mak, take her right\nhand.--Here, Okandaga, your left.\"\n\nAt that instant there was a shout in the village, so loud that we knew\nthe escape was discovered.  An indescribable hubbub ensued, but we soon\nlost it in the crackling of the underwood as we burst through it in our\nheadlong flight towards the cave.  The poor girl, feeling that her life\ndepended on it, exerted herself to the utmost, and with the aid of Jack\nand her lover kept well up.\n\n\"She'll never hold out to the end,\" said Peterkin, glancing over his\nshoulder as he ran.\n\nThe cries of the savages filled the woods in all directions, showing\nthat they had instantly scattered themselves in the pursuit, in order to\nincrease their chances of intercepting us.  We had already traversed the\ngreater part of the wood that lay between the village and the haunted\ncavern, when two negroes, who must have taken a shorter route, descried\nus.  They instantly uttered a yell of triumph and followed us at full\nspeed, while from the cries closing in upon us we could tell that the\nothers had heard and understood the shout.  Just then Okandaga's\nstrength began to fail, and her extreme terror, as the pursuers gained\non us, tended still further to increase her weakness.  This was all the\nmore unfortunate that we were now almost within a couple of hundred\nyards of the mouth of the cave.\n\nMakarooroo spoke encouragingly to her, but she was unable to reply, and\nit became evident that she was about to sink down altogether.  Jack\nglanced over his shoulder.  The two negroes were within fifty yards of\nus, but no others were in sight.\n\n\"Hold my gun,\" said Jack to me sharply.\n\nI seized it.  He instantly stooped down, grasped Okandaga round the\nwaist, and without stopping, swung her, with an exertion of strength\nthat seemed to me incredible, into his arms.  We gained the mouth of the\ncavern; Jack dropped Okandaga, who immediately ran in, while the rest of\nus stopped abruptly and faced about.\n\n\"Back, all of you,\" cried Jack, \"else they will be afraid to come on.\"\n\nThe words had scarcely passed his lips when the two negroes came up, but\nhalted a few yards from the mouth of the cave on seeing such a giant\nform guarding the entrance.\n\nTo let those men escape and reveal the place of our concealment was not\nto be thought of.  Jack darted out upon them.  They separated from each\nother as they turned to fly.  I was peeping out of the cave, and saw\nthat Jack could not secure them both; I therefore darted out, and\nquickly overtaking one, seized him by the hair of the head and dragged\nhim into the cave with the aid of Peterkin.  Jack lifted the other\nsavage completely from the ground, and carried him in struggling in his\ngripe like a child in its nurse's arms.\n\nThis last episode was enacted so quickly that the two negroes were\ncarried into the cavern and gagged before the other pursuers came up.\nAt the cave's mouth the whole of the men of the village shortly\nassembled with the king at their head.  Thus far the excitement of the\nchase had led them; but now that the first burst of their rage was over,\nand they found themselves on the threshold of that haunted cavern, the\nfear of which had been an element in their training from infancy, they\nfelt, no doubt, overawed by superstitious dread, and hesitated to enter,\nalthough most of them must have been convinced that the fugitives were\nthere.  Their fears increased as their anger abated, and they crowded\nround King Jambai, who seemed loath to take upon himself the honour of\nleader.\n\n\"They must have sought shelter here,\" said the king, pointing to the\ncavern and looking round with an assumption of boldness which he was\nevidently far from feeling.  \"Who among my warriors will follow me?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the evil spirits have carried them away,\" suggested one of the\nsable crew.\n\n\"That is the word of a coward,\" cried the king, who, although somewhat\ntimorous about spirits, was in reality a bold, brave man, and felt\nnettled that any of his warriors should show the white feather.  \"If\nevil spirits are there, our fetishman will drive them away.  Let the\ndoctor stand forth.\"\n\nAt that moment the doctor, worthy knave, must have wished in his inmost\nsoul that he had remained quietly at home and left to warriors the task\nof capturing the fugitives, but there was no resisting the mandate of\nthe king; besides, his honour and credit as a fetishman was at stake;\nmoreover, no doubt he felt somewhat emboldened by the presence of such a\nlarge number of men--there were certainly several hundreds on the\nground--so, all things considered, he thought it best to accept the post\nof leader with a good grace.  Stepping quickly forward, he cried, \"Let\ntorches be brought, and I will lead the way.\"\n\nA murmur of approbation ran through the crowd of blacks, who, like a\nflock of sheep, felt bold enough to follow a leader blindly.\n\nWhile the consultation was going on outside, we were making hasty\npreparation for defending ourselves to the last extremity.  Peterkin, in\nparticular, was extremely active, and, to say truth, his actions\nsurprised us not a little.  I once or twice fancied that excitement had\nturned his brain.  He first dressed up his head in a species of wild\nturban made of dried grass and tall sedgy leaves; then he put several\npatches of red and white earth on his black face, as well as on his body\nin various places, and fastened a number of loose pieces of rag, torn\nfrom a handkerchief, and bits of tattered leaves to his arms and legs in\nsuch a manner as to give him an extremely wild and dishevelled\nappearance.  I must say that when his hasty toilet was completed he\nseemed to me the most horrible-looking demon I had ever conceived of.\nHe next poured out nearly a whole flask of gunpowder on a ledge of rock,\nthe edge of which was visible from the entrance to the cave, while the\nrock itself concealed him from view.  Last of all, he took up the three\ncones of moistened gunpowder which the reader will remember he had made\nbefore we left the cave to attack the village.  One of these he placed\namong the grass and branches on his head, the other two he held in his\nhands.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" he said, when all was ready, \"all I have to ask of you is\nthat you will stand by with matches, and when I give the word light the\npoints of those three cones of gunpowder simultaneously and instantly,\nand leave me to finish the remainder of my part.  Of course you will be\nprepared to back me up with your rifles if need be, but keep well out of\nsight at first.\"\n\nWe now saw the drift of our eccentric friend's intention, but for my\npart I felt little confidence in his success.  The plan seemed\naltogether too wild and absurd.  But our danger was imminent.  No way of\nescape seemed possible, and it is wonderful how readily men will grasp\nat anything in the shape of a ruse or stratagem, no matter how silly or\nwild, that affords the most distant chance of escape from danger.  Jack,\ntoo, I could see from the look of his face, put little faith in the\nplan; and I observed an expression on the countenance of our negro guide\nwhich seemed to indicate that his respect for Peterkin's wisdom was on\nthe wane.\n\nWe had not to wait long.  The doctor, with several torch-bearers,\nsuddenly darted in with a shout, followed closely by the warriors, who\nyelled furiously, in order, no doubt, to keep up their courage.\n\nAlarmed by such an unusual hubbub in their usually quiet domain, the\nbats came swooping from their holes in the walls by hundreds, and the\ntorches were extinguished almost instantly.  The savages who were near\nthe entrance drew back in haste; those who had entered stood rooted to\nthe spot in terror.\n\n\"Now!\" whispered Peterkin eagerly.\n\nWe struck our lights at once and applied them to the points of the\ngunpowder cones, which instantly began to spout forth a shower of sparks\nwith great violence.  Peterkin darted out from behind the rock with a\nyell so appalling that we ourselves were startled by it, having\nforgotten that it formed an element in his plan.  In passing he allowed\na few sparks to fall on the heap of powder, which exploded with so\nbright a flame that the whole cavern was illuminated for an instant.  It\nalso set fire to the ragged scraps with which Peterkin had decked\nhimself out--a result which had neither been intended nor anticipated--\nso that he rushed towards the mouth of the cave howling with pain as\nwell as with a desire to scare the savages.\n\nThe effect of this apparition was tremendous.  The negroes turned and\ncrushed through the narrow entrance screaming and shrieking with terror.\nThe bats, no less alarmed than the men, and half suffocated with smoke,\nfled out of the cave like a whirlwind, flapping their wings on the heads\nof the negroes in their flight, and adding, if that were possible, to\ntheir consternation.  The negroes ran as never men ran before, tumbling\nover each other in their mad haste, dashing against trees and crashing\nthrough bushes in their terror, while Peterkin stood leaping in the\ncave's mouth, smoking and blazing and spurting, and unable to contain\nhimself, giving vent to prolonged peals of demoniacal laughter.  Had the\nlaugh been that of negroes it might have been recognised; but Peterkin's\nwas the loud, violent, British guffaw, which, I make no doubt, was\ndeemed by them worthy of the fiends of the haunted cave, and served to\nspur them on to still greater rapidity in their wild career.\n\nReturning into the cave's innermost recess, we lighted one of the\ntorches dropped by the savages, and placing it in a sort of natural\nniche, seated ourselves on several pieces of rock to rest.\n\nOur first act was to look earnestly in each other's faces; our next to\nburst into peals of laughter.\n\n\"I say, comrades,\" I exclaimed, checking myself, \"don't we run some risk\nin giving vent to our feelings so freely?\"\n\n\"No fear,\" cried Peterkin, who was still smoking a little from\nunextinguished sparks.  \"There is not a man in the whole crew who will\ndraw rein till he is sitting, with the teeth still chattering in his\nhead, at his own fireside.  I never saw men in such a fright since I was\nborn.  Depend upon it, we are safe enough here from this day forth.--\nDon't you think so, Mak?\"\n\nOur guide, who was now trying to reassure his trembling bride, turned,\nwith a broad grin on his sable countenance, and said--\n\n\"Safe? ho! yis, massa.  Dere not be a man as'll come to dis yere cuvern\nfor de nix tree hun'r year or more.  Massa Peterkin be de most\nhorriboble ghost dey ever did saw, an' no mistake.  But, massas, we mus'\ngo 'way quick an' git to our camp, for de king sure to go dere an' see\nif you no hab someting to do wid it all.  Him's a bery clebber king, am\nJambai--bery clebber; him's no be bughummed bery easy.\"\n\n\"Humbugged, you mean,\" said Jack, laughing.  \"You're right, Mak; we must\nset off at once.  But what _are_ we to do with poor Okandaga, now that\nwe have got her?\"\n\nThis was indeed a puzzling question.  It was impossible to take her to\nour camp and account to the negroes for her appearance in a satisfactory\nmanner; besides, if Jambai took it into his head to pursue us, in order\nto ascertain whether we had had anything to do with the rescue, our case\nwould be hopeless.  It was equally impossible to leave her where she\nwas, and to let her try to make her escape through the woods alone was\nnot to be thought of.  While we pondered this dilemma an idea occurred\nto me.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said I, \"that men are seldom, perhaps never, thrown\ninto a danger or difficulty in this world without some way of escape\nbeing opened up, which, if they will but grasp at it promptly, will\nconduct them at last out of their perplexities.  Now, it has just\noccurred to me that, since everything else seems to be impossible, we\nmight send Okandaga into the woods, with Makarooroo to guide and defend\nher and to hunt for her.  Let them travel in a line parallel with the\nriver route which we intend to follow.  Each night Mak will make a\nsecure shelter for her, and then return to our camp as if he had come in\nfrom hunting.  Each morning he will set off again into the woods as if\nto hunt, rejoin Okandaga; and thus we will journey together, as it were,\nand when we reach the next tribe of natives we will leave the girl in\ntheir charge until we return from the gorilla country.  What do you\nthink of that plan?\"\n\n\"Not a bad one,\" replied Jack; \"but if Mak is away all day, what are we\nto do for an interpreter?\"\n\n\"Make him describe to us and to the men the day's route before leaving\nus,\" suggested Peterkin; \"and as for the talking, we can manage that\nwell enough for all needful purposes by a mixture of the few phrases we\nknow with signs.\"\n\nIn the excitement of this whole affair we had totally forgotten our two\nprisoners, who lay not far from us on the ground, gagged and pinioned.\nWe were now reminded of their presence rather abruptly.  We must have\nsecured their fastenings badly, for during the time we were conversing\nthey managed to free themselves, and made a sudden dash past us.  Jack's\neye fortunately caught sight of them in time.  He sprang up, rushed at\nthe one nearest him, and throwing out his foot as he passed, tripped him\nup.  It chanced that at that spot there was a deep hole in the floor of\nthe cavern.  Into this the poor wretch plunged head first, and he was\nkilled on the spot.  Meanwhile, the other gained the outlet of the cave,\nand had almost escaped into the forest, when Makarooroo darted after him\nwith the speed of an antelope.  In a few seconds we heard a cry, and\nshortly after our guide returned with his knife clotted with blood.  He\nhad overtaken and slain the other negro.\n\nI cannot convey to the reader the horror that filled me and my two\ncompanions at this unexpected and melancholy termination of the affair.\nYet we felt that we were guiltless of rashly spilling human blood, for\nJack had no intention of killing the poor negro whom he tripped up; and\nas to the other, we could not have prevented our guide from doing what\nhe did.  He himself deemed it justifiable, and said that if that man had\nescaped to the village, and told who it was that frightened them out of\nthe cave, they would certainly have come back and murdered us all.\nThere was truth in this.  Still we could not but feel overwhelmed with\nsadness at the incident.\n\nWe were now doubly anxious to get away from this cave, so we rapidly\nfinished the discussion of our plan, and Jack arranged that he should\naccompany what may be termed the overland part of our expedition.  This\nsettled, we washed the charcoal off our persons, with the exception of\nthat on our faces, having been advised by King Jambai himself to hunt\nwith black faces, as wild animals were quicker to perceive our white\nskins than their black ones.  Then we resumed our garments, and quitting\nthe haunted cavern, set out on our return journey to the camp.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nPETERKIN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF, AND OKANDAGA IS DISPOSED OF, ETCETERA.\n\nWhen within about three miles of the place where our men had been\nordered to haul the canoe out of the water and make the camp, we came to\na halt and prepared a spot for Okandaga to spend an hour or two in\nsleep.  The poor creature was terribly exhausted.  We selected a very\nsequestered place in a rocky piece of ground, where the light of the\nsmall fire we kindled, in order to cook her some supper, could not be\nseen by any one who might chance to pass by that way.\n\nJack remained with her, but the guide went on with us, in order to give\ninstructions to our men, who, when we arrived, seemed much surprised\nthat we had made such a bad hunt during the night.  Having pointed out\nour route, Makarooroo then left us, and we lay down to obtain a few\nhours' repose.\n\nWe had not lain more than an hour when one of our men awoke us, saying\nthat it was time to start; so we rose, very unwillingly, and embarked.\n\n\"I say, Ralph,\" observed Peterkin, as we glided up the stream, which in\nthis place was narrow and sluggish, \"isn't it strange that mankind, as a\nrule, with very few exceptions, should so greatly dislike getting up in\nthe morning?\"\n\n\"It is rather curious, no doubt.  But I suspect we have ourselves to\nthank for the disinclination.  If we did not sit up so late at night we\nshould not feel the indisposition to rise so strong upon us in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"There you are quite wrong, Ralph.  I always find that the sooner I go\nto bed the later I am in getting up.  The fact is, I've tried every\nmethod of rousing myself, and without success.  And yet I can say\nconscientiously that I am desirous of improving; for when at sea I used\nto have my cot slung at the head with a block-tackle, and I got one of\nthe middies to come when the watch was changed and lower me, so that my\nhead lay on the deck below, and my feet pointed to the beams above.  And\nwould you believe it, I got so accustomed to this at last that, when\ndesperately sleepy, I used to hold on in that position for a few\nminutes, and secure a short nap during the process of suffocation with\nblood to the head.\"\n\n\"You must indeed have been incorrigible,\" said I, laughing.\n\"Nevertheless, I feel assured that the want of will lies at the root of\nthe evil.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" retorted Peterkin testily; \"people always say that\nwhen I try to defend myself.\"\n\n\"Is it not probable that people always say that just because they feel\nthat there is truth in the remark?\"\n\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated my friend.\n\n\"Besides,\" I continued, \"our success in battling with the evil\ntendencies of our natures depends often very much on the manner in which\nwe make the attack.  I have pondered this subject deeply, and have come\nto the conclusion that there is a certain moment in the awaking hour of\neach day which if seized and improved gains for us the victory.  You\nknow Shakespeare's judicious remark--`There is a tide in the affairs of\nmen which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,' or something to\nthat effect.  I never feel quite sure of the literal correctness of my\nquotations, although I am generally certain as to the substance.  Well,\nthere is a tide also in the affair of getting up in the morning, and its\nflood-point is the precise instant when you recover consciousness.  At\nthat moment every one, I believe, has moral courage to leap violently\nout of bed; but let that moment pass, and you sink supinely back, if not\nto sleep, at least into a desperate condition of unconquerable\nlethargy.\"\n\n\"You may be very correct in your reasoning,\" returned Peterkin; \"but not\nhaving pondered that subject quite so deeply as you seem to have done, I\nshall modestly refrain from discussing it.  Meanwhile I will go ashore,\nand stalk yonder duck which floats so comfortably and lazily in the cove\njust beyond the point ahead of us, that I think it must be in the\ncondition of one who, having missed the flood-tide you have just\nreferred to, is revelling in the luxury of its second nap.--Ho, you\nebony-faced scoundrel!\" he added, turning to the negro who steered our\ncanoe; \"shove ashore, like a good fellow.--Come, Ralph, lend me your\nfowling-piece, and do you carry my big rifle.  There is nothing so good\nfor breakfast as a fat duck killed and roasted before it has had time to\ncool.\"\n\n\"And here is a capital spot on which to breakfast,\" said I, as we\nlanded.\n\n\"First-rate.  Now then, follow me, and mind your muzzle.  Better put the\nrifle over your shoulder, Ralph, so that if it does go off it may hit\nthe sun or one of the stars.  A six-ounce ball in one's spine is not a\npleasant companion in a hunting expedition.\"\n\n\"But,\" retorted I, \"you forget that I am particularly careful.  I always\ncarry my piece on half-cock, and _never_ put my finger on the trigger.\"\n\n\"Indeed: not even when you pull it?\"\n\n\"Of course when I am about to fire; but you know well enough what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Hush, Ralph! we must keep silence now and step lightly.\"\n\nIn a few minutes we had gained the clump of bushes close behind which\nthe duck lay; and Peterkin, going down on all fours, crept forward to\nget a shot.  I followed him in the same manner, and when he stopped to\ntake a deliberate aim, I crept up alongside.  The duck had heard our\napproach, and was swimming about in a somewhat agitated manner among the\ntall reeds, so that my companion made one or two unsuccessful attempts\nto take aim.\n\n\"What an aggravating thing!\" exclaimed Peterkin in a whisper.\n\nAt that moment I happened to cast my eyes across the river, and the\nreader may judge of my surprise when I beheld two elephants standing\namong the trees.  They stood so silently and so motionless, and were so\nlike in colour to the surrounding foliage, that we had actually\napproached to within about thirty yards without observing them.  I\ntouched Peterkin on the shoulder, and pointed to them without saying a\nword.  The expression of amazement that instantly overspread his\nfeatures showed that he also saw them.\n\n\"The rifle, Ralph,\" he said, in a low, excited whisper.\n\nI handed it to him.  With careful deliberation he took aim, and fired at\nthe animal nearest to us.  The heavy ball entered its huge body just\nbehind the shoulder.  Both elephants tossed up their trunks, and\nelevating their great ears they dashed furiously into the bush; but the\none that had been hit, after plunging head foremost down a low bank fell\nto the ground with a heavy crash, quite dead.\n\nIt was a splendid shot.  The natives, who almost immediately after came\nup screaming with delight, could scarcely believe their eyes.  They\ndashed across the river in the canoe, while some of them, regardless of\nthe alligators that might be hidden there, sprang into the water and\nswam over.\n\n\"I'm sorry we did not get the duck, however,\" observed Peterkin, as we\nreturned to the place where we had left the canoe.  \"Elephant meat is\ncoarse, nasty stuff, and totally unfit for civilised mouths, though\nthese niggers seem to relish it amazingly.\"\n\n\"You forget the baked foot,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, so I did.  It was pretty good, certainly; but that's the only\npart o' the brute that's fit to eat.\"\n\nSoon after this the canoe came back and took us over the river; and we\nbreakfasted on the side where the elephant had fallen, in order to allow\nthe natives to cut off such portions of the meat as they required, and\nto secure the tusks.  Then we continued our journey, and at night\nencamped near a grove of palm-trees which Makarooroo had described to\nus, and where we were soon joined by him and Jack, who told us that he\nhad got on well, during the day--that he had shot an antelope, and had\nseen a zebra and a rhinoceros, besides a variety of smaller game.  He\nalso told us that Okandaga was encamped in a place of safety a few miles\nto the right of our position, and that she had stood the journey well.\n\nI was much interested by Jack's account of the zebra and the rhinoceros,\nspecimens of both of which animals I had seen in menageries, and felt\ndisposed to change places with him on the march; but reflecting that he\nwas much more likely than I successfully to hunt anything he might\npursue, I made up my mind to remain by the canoe.\n\nThus we travelled for several days without anything particular\noccurring, and at length arrived at a native village which lay on the\nbanks of a noble stream.\n\nHere Makarooroo introduced us to Mbango the chief, a fine-looking and\ngood-natured negro, who received us most hospitably, supplied us with\nfood, and urged us to remain and hunt with his people.  This, however,\nwe declined to do, telling our entertainer that we had come to his\ncountry for the purpose of shooting that wonderful animal the gorilla,\nbut assuring him that we would come back without fail if we should be\nspared.  We further assured him on this head by proposing to leave in\nhis charge a woman for whom we had a great respect and love, and whom we\nmade him promise faithfully to take care of till we returned.\n\nPeterkin, who soon gave them a specimen of his powers as a marksman, and\ncontrived in other ways to fill the minds of the chief and his people\nwith a very exalted idea of his powers both of body and intellect,\nendeavoured to make assurance doubly sure by working on their\nsuperstitious fears.\n\n\"Tell Mbango,\" said he to our guide, \"that though we be small in numbers\nwe are very powerful; that we can do deeds\" (here he became awfully\nsolemn and mysterious) \"such as no black man ever conceived of; and that\nif a hair of the head of Okandaga is hurt, we will on our return--\"\n\nInstead of completing the sentence, Peterkin started up, threw himself\ninto violent contortions, rolled his eyes in a fearful manner, and, in\nshort, gave the chief and his people to understand that something quite\nindescribable and unutterably terrible would be the result of their\nplaying us false.\n\n\"Send for Njamie,\" said Mbango to one of his retainers.\n\nNjamie, who was the chief's principal wife, soon appeared.  She led a\nsturdy little boy by the hand.  He was her only son, and a very fine\nlittle fellow, despite the blackness of his skin and his almost total\nwant of clothing.\n\nTo this woman Mbango gave Okandaga in charge, directing her in our\npresence how to care for her, and assuring her of the most terrible\npunishment should anything befall the woman committed to her care.\n\nNjamie was a mild, agreeable woman.  She had more modesty of demeanour\nand humility of aspect than the most of the women of her tribe whom we\nhappened to see, so that we felt disposed to believe that Okandaga was\nplaced in as safe keeping as it was possible for us to provide for her\nin our circumstances.  Even Makarooroo appeared to be quite at ease in\nhis mind; and it was evidently with a relieved breast and a light heart\nthat he bade adieu to his bride, and started along with us on the\nfollowing day on our journey into the deeper recesses of the wilderness.\n\nBefore entering upon these transactions with the people of this village,\nwe took care to keep our crew in total ignorance of what passed by\nsending them on in advance with the canoe under Jack's care, a few hours\nbefore we brought Okandaga into the village, or even made mention of her\nexistence; and we secured their ready obedience to our orders, and total\nindifference as to our motives in these incomprehensible actions, by\ngiving them each a few inches of tobacco--a gift which rendered them\nsupremely happy.\n\nOne day, about a week after the events above narrated, we met with an\nadventure which well-nigh cost Jack his life, but which ultimately\nresulted in an important change in our manner of travelling.  We were\ntraversing an extremely beautiful country with the goods on our\nshoulders, having, in consequence of the increasing turbulence of the\nriver as well as its change of direction, been compelled to abandon our\ncanoe, and cut across the country in as straight a line as its nature\nwould permit.  But this was not easy, for the grass, which was bright\ngreen, was so long as to reach sometimes higher than our shoulders.\n\nIn this species of country Jack's towering height really became of great\nuse, enabling him frequently to walk along with his head above the\nsurrounding herbage, while we were compelled to grope along, ignorant of\nall that was around us save the tall grass at our sides.  Occasionally,\nhowever, we came upon more open ground, where the grass was short, and\nthen we enjoyed the lovely scenery to the full.  We met with a great\nvariety of new plants and trees in this region.  Many of the latter were\nfestooned with wild vines and other climbing plants.  Among others, I\nsaw several specimens of that curious and interesting tree the banyan,\nwith its drop-shoots in every state of growth--some beginning to point\ntowards the earth, in which they were ultimately destined to take root;\nsome more than half-way down; while others were already fixed, forming\nstout pillars to their parent branches--thus, as it were, on reaching\nmaturity, rendering that support which it is the glory as well as the\nprivilege of youth to accord to age.  Besides these, there were wild\ndates and palmyra trees, and many others too numerous to mention, but\nthe peculiar characteristics of which I carefully jotted down in my\nnote-book.  Many small water-courses were crossed, in some of which Mak\npointed out a number of holes, which he said were made by elephants\nwading in them.  He also told us that several mud-pools, which seemed to\nhave been recently and violently stirred up, were caused by the\nwallowing of the rhinoceros; so we kept at all times a sharp lookout for\na shot.\n\nLions were also numerous in this neighbourhood, and we constantly heard\nthem roaring at night, but seldom saw them during our march.\n\nWell, as I have already remarked, one day we were travelling somewhat\nslowly through the long grass of this country, when, feeling oppressed\nby the heat, as well as somewhat fatigued with my load, I called to\nJack, who was in advance, to stop for a few minutes to rest.\n\n\"Most willingly,\" he replied, throwing down his load, and wiping away\nthe perspiration which stood in large drops on his brow.  \"I was on the\npoint of calling a halt when you spoke.--How do you get on down there,\nPeterkin?\"\n\nOur friend, who had seated himself on the bale he had been carrying, and\nseemed to be excessively hot, looked up with a comical expression of\ncountenance, and replied--\n\n\"Pretty well, thank'ee.  How do _you_ get on _up there_?\"\n\n\"Oh, capitally.  There's such a nice cool breeze blowing, I'm quite\nsorry that I cannot send a little of it down.\"\n\n\"Don't distress yourself, my dear fellow; I'll come up to snuff it.\"\n\nSo saying, Peterkin sprang nimbly upon Jack's shoulders, and began to\ngaze round him.\n\n\"I say, Peterkin,\" said Jack, \"why are you a very clever fellow just\nnow?\"\n\n\"Don't know,\" replied Peterkin.  \"I give it up at once.  Always do.\nNever could guess a riddle in all my life.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Jack, \"you're `_up to snuff_.'\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! that certainly deserves a _pinch_; so there's for you.\"\n\nJack uttered a roar, and tossed Peterkin off his shoulders, on receiving\nthe punishment.\n\n\"Shabby fellow!\" cried Peterkin, rubbing his head.  \"But, I say, do let\nme up again.  I thought, just as you dropped me, that I saw a place\nwhere the grass is short.  Ay, there it is, fifty yards or so ahead of\nus, with a palmyra tree on it.  Come, let us go rest there, for I\nconfess that I feel somewhat smothered in this long grass.\"\n\nWe took up our packs immediately, and carried them to the spot\nindicated, which we found almost free from long grass.  Here we lay down\nto enjoy the delightful shade of the tree, and the magnificent view of\nthe country around us.  Our negroes also seemed to enjoy the shade, but\nthey were evidently not nearly so much oppressed with the heat as we\nwere, which was very natural.  They seemed to have no perception of the\nbeautiful in nature, however, although they appreciated fully the\nagreeable influences by which they were surrounded.\n\nWhile I lay at the foot of that tree, pondering this subject, I observed\na very strange-looking insect engaged in a very curious kind of\noccupation.  Peterkin's eye caught sight of it at the same instant with\nmine.\n\n\"Hollo!  Jack, look here!\" he cried in a whisper.  \"I declare, here's a\nbeast been and shoved its head into a hole, and converted its tail into\na trap!\"\n\nWe all three lay down as quietly as possible, and I could not but smile\nwhen I thought of the literal correctness of my friend's quaint\ndescription of what we saw.\n\nThe insect was a species of ant-eater.  It was about an inch and a\nquarter long, as thick as a crow-quill, and covered with black hair.  It\nput its head into a little hole in the ground, and quivered its tail\nrapidly.  The ants, which seemed to be filled with curiosity at this\npeculiar sight, went near to see what the strange thing could be; and no\nsooner did one come within the range of the forceps on the insect's\ntail, than it was snapped up.\n\n\"Now, that is the most original trapper I ever did see or hear of,\"\nremarked Peterkin, with a broad grin.  \"I've seen many things in my\ntravels, but I never expected to meet with a beast that could catch\nothers by merely wagging its tail.\"\n\n\"You forget the hunters of North America,\" said Jack, \"who entice little\nantelopes towards them by merely wagging a bit of rag on the end of a\nramrod.\"\n\n\"I forget nothing of the sort,\" retorted Peterkin.  \"Wagging a ramrod is\nnot wagging a tail.  Besides, I spoke of beasts doing it; men are not\nbeasts.\"\n\n\"Then I hold you self-convicted, my boy,\" exclaimed Jack; \"for you have\noften called _me_ a beast.\"\n\n\"By no means, Jack.  I am not self-convicted, but quite correct, as I\ncan prove to the satisfaction of any one who isn't a philosopher.  You\nnever can prove anything to a philosopher.\"\n\n\"Prove it, then.\"\n\n\"I will.  Isn't a monkey a beast?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Isn't a gorilla a monkey?\"\n\n\"No doubt it is.\"\n\n\"And aren't _you_ a gorilla?\"\n\n\"I say, lads, it's time to be going,\" cried Jack, with a laugh, as he\nrose and resumed his load.\n\nAt that moment Mak uttered an exclamation, and pointed towards a\nparticular spot in the plain before us, where, close by a clump of\ntrees, we saw the graceful head and neck and part of the shoulders of a\ngiraffe.  We were naturally much excited at the sight, this being the\nfirst we had fallen in with.\n\n\"You'd better go after it,\" said Jack to Peterkin, \"and take Mak with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I'd rather you'd go yourself,\" replied Peterkin; \"for, to say truth,\nI'm pretty well knocked up to-day.  I don't know how it is--one day one\nfeels made of iron, as if nothing could tire one; and the next, one\nfeels quite weak and spiritless.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll go; but I shall not take any one with me.--Take observation\nof the sun, Mak, and keep a straight course as you are now going until\nnight.  D'ye see yonder ridge?\"\n\n\"Yes, massa.\"\n\n\"Then hold on direct for that, and encamp there.  I'll not be long\nbehind you, and hope to bring you a giraffe steak for supper.\"\n\nWe endeavoured to dissuade Jack from going out alone, but he said truly\nthat his load distributed among us all was quite sufficient, without\nadding to it by taking away another member of the party.  Thus we\nparted; but I felt a strange feeling of depression, a kind of foreboding\nof evil, which I could not shake off, despite my utmost efforts.\nPeterkin, too, was unusually silent, and I could not avoid seeing that\nhe felt more anxiety on account of Jack's rashness than he was willing\nto allow.  Our friend took with him one of our large-bore rifles, and a\ndouble-barrel of smaller bore slung at his back.\n\nShortly after parting with him, we descried an ostrich feeding in the\nplain before us.  I had long desired to meet with a specimen of this\ngigantic bird in its native wilds, and Peterkin was equally anxious to\nget a shot at it; so we called a halt, and prepared to stalk it.  We\nwere aware that the ostrich is a very silly and very timid bird, but not\nbeing aware of the best method of hunting it, we asked Makarooroo to\nexplain how he was in the habit of doing it.\n\n\"You mus' know,\" he began, \"dat bird hims be a mos' ex'roroninary beast.\nWhen hims run hims go fasterer dan--oh! it be dumpossobable for say how\nmuch fast hims go.  You no can see him's legs; dey go same as legs ob\nleetle bird.  But hims be horrobably stupid.  Suppose he see you far,\nfar away, goin' to de wind'ard ob him, he no run 'way to leeward; hims\ntink you wants to get round him, so off him start to git past you, and\nbefore hims pass he sometimes come close 'nuff to be shooted or speared.\nMe hab spear him dat way, but him's awful differcult to git at for all\ndat.\"\n\n\"Well then, Mak, after that lucid explanation, what d'you propose that\nwe should do?\" inquired Peterkin, examining the locks of his rifle.\n\n\"Me pruppose dat you go far ober dere, Massa Ralph go not jist so far,\nand me go to de wind'ard and gib him fright.\"\n\nActing upon this advice, we proceeded cautiously to the several spots\nindicated, and our guide set off towards an exposed place, where he\nintended to show himself.  In a few minutes we observed the gigantic\nbird look up in alarm, and then we saw Makarooroo running like a deer\nover the plain.  The ostrich instantly rushed off madly at full speed,\nnot, as might have been expected, in a contrary direction, or towards\nany place of shelter, but simply, as it appeared to me, with no other\nend in view than that of getting to windward of his supposed enemy.  I\nobserved that he took a direction which would quickly bring him within\nrange of my companion's rifle, but I was so amazed at the speed with\nwhich he ran that I could think of nothing else.\n\nEvery one knows that the ostrich has nothing worthy of the name of\nwings--merely a small tuft of feathers at each side, with which he\ncannot make even an attempt to fly; but every one does not know,\nprobably, that with his stout and long legs he can pass over the ground\nnearly at the ordinary speed of a locomotive engine.  I proved this to\nmy own satisfaction by taking accurate observation.  On first observing\nthe tremendous speed at which he was going, I seized my note-book, and\npulling out my watch, endeavoured to count the number of steps he took\nin a minute.  This, however, I found was totally impossible; for his\nlegs, big though they were, went so fast that I could no more count them\nthan I could count the spokes of a carriage-wheel.  I observed, however,\nthat there were two bushes on the plain in the direction of his flight,\nwhich he would soon have to pass.  I therefore laid down my note-book\nand rifle, and stood with my watch in hand, ready to note the precise\ninstants at which he should pass the first and second.  By afterwards\ncounting the number of footsteps on the ground between the bushes, and\ncomparing the result with the time occupied in passing between the two,\nI thus proposed to myself to ascertain his rate of speed.\n\nScarcely had I conceived this idea when the bird passed the first bush,\nand I glanced at my watch; then he passed the second, and I glanced\nagain.  Thus I noted that he took exactly ten seconds to pass from one\nbush to the other.  While I was in the act of jotting this down I heard\nthe report of Peterkin's rifle, and looking up hastily, saw the\ntail-feathers of the ostrich knocked into the air, but the bird itself\npassed on uninjured.  I was deeply mortified at this failure, and all\nthe more so that, from past experience, I had been led to believe that\nmy friend _never_ missed his mark.  Hurrying up, I exclaimed--\n\n\"Why, my dear fellow, what _can_ have come over you?\"\n\nPoor Peterkin seemed really quite distressed; he looked quite humbled at\nfirst.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"it's all very well for you to say, `What has come over\nyou?' but you ought to make allowance for a man who has carried a heavy\nload all the forenoon.  Besides, he was almost beyond range.  Moreover,\nalthough I have hunted a good deal, I really have not been in the habit\nof firing at animal locomotives under full steam.  Did you ever see such\na slapping pace and such an outrageous pair of legs, Ralph?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said I.  \"But come with me to yonder bushes.  I'm going to make\na calculation.\"\n\n\"What's a calcoolashun?\" inquired our guide, who came up at that moment,\npanting violently.\n\n\"It's a summation, case of counting up one, two, three, etcetera--and\nmay be multiplying, subtracting, and dividing into the bargain.\"\n\n\"Ho! dat's what me been do at de missionary school.\"\n\n\"Exactly; but what sort of calculation Ralph means to undertake at\npresent I know not.  Perhaps he's going to try to find out whether, if\nwe were to run at the rate of six miles an hour till doomsday, in the\nwrong direction, there would be any chance of our ever sticking that\nostrich's tail again on his big body.  But come along; we shall see.\"\n\nOn reaching the spot I could scarcely believe my eyes.  Each step this\nbird had taken measured fourteen feet in length!  I always carried a\nrolled-up yard-measure about with me, which I applied to the steps, so\nthat I could make no mistake.  There were exactly thirty of those\ngigantic paces between the two bushes.  This multiplied by six gave 180\nsteps, or 2,520 feet in one minute, which resulted in 151,200 feet, or\n50,400 yards, or very nearly thirty miles in the hour.\n\n\"No wonder I only knocked his tail off,\" said Peterkin.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said I, \"the wonder is that under the circumstances\nyou hit the bird at all.\"\n\nOn further examination of the place where we had seen the ostrich before\nit was alarmed, we ascertained that his ordinary walking pace varied\nfrom twenty to twenty-six inches in length.\n\nAfter this unsuccessful hunt we returned to our comrades, and proceeded\nto the rendezvous where we expected to find Jack; but as he was not\nthere, we concluded that he must have wandered farther than he intended,\nso, throwing down our packs, we set about preparing the camp and a good\nsupper against his return.  Gradually the sun began to sink low on the\nhorizon; then he dipped below it, and the short twilight of those\nlatitudes was rapidly merging into night; but Jack did not return, and\nthe uneasiness which we had all along felt in regard to him increased so\nmuch that we could not refrain from showing it.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, Ralph,\" cried Peterkin, starting up suddenly:\n\"I'm not going to sit here wasting the time when Jack may be in some\ndesperate fix.  I'll go and hunt for him.\"\n\n\"Me tink you right,\" said our guide; \"dere is ebery sort ob ting here--\nbeasties and mans.  P'raps Massa Jack am be kill.\"\n\nI could not help shuddering at the bare idea of such a thing, so I at\nonce seconded my companion's proposal, and resolved to accompany him.\n\n\"Take your double-barrel, Ralph, and I'll lend our spare big gun to\nMak.\"\n\n\"But how are we to proceed? which way are we to go?  I have not the most\ndistant idea as to what direction we ought to go in our search.\"\n\n\"Leave that to Mak.  He knows the ways o' the country best, and the\nprobable route that Jack has taken.  Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Shall we take some brandy?\"\n\n\"Ay; well thought of.  He'll perhaps be the better of something of that\nsort if anything has befallen him.  Now, then, let's go.\"\n\nLeaving our men in charge of the camp, with strict injunctions to keep\ngood watch and not allow the fires to go down, lest they should be\nattacked by lions, we three set forth on our nocturnal search.  From\ntime to time we stood still and shouted in a manner that would let our\nlost friend know that we were in search of him, should he be within\nearshot, but no answering cry came back to us; and we were beginning to\ndespair, when we came upon the footprints of a man in the soft soil of a\nswampy spot we had to cross.  It was a clear moonlight night, so that we\ncould distinguish them perfectly.\n\n\"Ho!\" exclaimed our guide, as he stooped to examine the marks.\n\n\"Well, Mak, what do you make of it?\" inquired Peterkin anxiously.\n\nMak made no reply for a few seconds; then he rose, and said earnestly,\n\"Dat am Massa Jack's foot.\"\n\nI confess that I was somewhat surprised at the air of confidence with\nwhich our guide made this statement; for after a most careful\nexamination of the prints, which were exceedingly indistinct, I could\ndiscern nothing to indicate that they had been made by Jack.\n\n\"Are you sure, Mak?\" asked Peterkin.\n\n\"Sartin sure, massa.\"\n\n\"Then push on as fast as you can.\"\n\nPresently we came to a spot where the ground was harder and the prints\nmore distinct.\n\n\"Ha! you're wrong, Mak,\" cried Peterkin, in a voice of disappointment,\nas he stooped to examine the footsteps again.  \"Here we have the print\nof a naked foot; Jack wore shoes.  And, what's this? blood!\"\n\n\"Yis, massa, me know dat Massa Jack hab shoes.  But dat be him's foot\nfor all dat, and him's hurt somehow for certain.\"\n\nThe reader may imagine our state of mind on making this discovery.\nWithout uttering another word, we quickened our pace into a smart run,\nkeeping closely in the track of Jack's steps.  Soon we observed that\nthese deviated from side to side in an extraordinary manner, as if the\nperson who made them had been unable to walk straight.  In a few minutes\nmore we came on the footprints of a rhinoceros--a sight which still\nfurther increased our alarm.  On coming out from among a clump of low\nbushes that skirted the edge of a small plain, we observed a dark object\nlying on the ground about fifty yards distant from us.  I almost sank\ndown with an undefinable feeling of dread on beholding this.\n\nWe held our rifles in readiness as we approached it at a quick pace, for\nwe knew not whether it was not a wild animal which might spring upon us\nthe moment we came close enough.  But a few seconds dispelled our dread\nof such an attack and confirmed our worst fears, for there, in a pool of\nblood, lay Jack's manly form.  The face was upturned, and the moon,\nwhich shone full upon it, showed that it was pale as death and covered\nwith blood.  His clothes were rent and dishevelled and covered with\ndust, as if he had struggled hard with some powerful foe, and all round\nthe spot were footprints of a rhinoceros, revealing too clearly the\ncharacter of the terrible monster with which our friend had engaged in\nunequal conflict.\n\nPeterkin darted forward, tore open Jack's shirt at the breast, and laid\nhis hand upon his heart.\n\n\"Thank God,\" he muttered, in a low, subdued tone, \"he's not dead!\nQuick, Ralph--the brandy-flask.\"\n\nI instantly poured a little of the spirit into the silver cup attached\nto the flask, and handed it to Peterkin, who, after moistening Jack's\nlips, began assiduously to rub his chest and forehead with brandy.\nKneeling down by his side I assisted him, while I applied some to his\nfeet.  While we were thus engaged we observed that our poor friend's\narms and chest had received several severe bruises and some slight\nwounds, and we also discovered a terrible gash in his right thigh which\nhad evidently been made by the formidable horn of the rhinoceros.  This,\nand the other wounds which were still bleeding pretty freely, we\nstanched and bound up, and our exertions were at length rewarded by the\nsight of a faint tinge of colour returning to Jack's cheeks.  Presently\nhis eyes quivered, and heaving a short, broken sigh, he looked up.\n\n\"Where am I, eh?  Why, what's wrong? what has happened?\" he asked\nfaintly, in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"All right, old boy.  Here, take a swig of this, you abominable\ngorilla,\" said Peterkin, holding the brandy-flask to his mouth, while\none or two tears of joy rolled down his cheeks.\n\nJack drank, and rallied a little.\n\n\"I've been ill, I see,\" he said gently.  \"Ah!  I remember now.  I've\nbeen hurt--the rhinoceros; eh, have you killed it?  I gave it a good\nshot.  It must have been mortal, I think.\"\n\n\"Whether you've killed it or not I cannot tell,\" said I, taking off my\ncoat and putting it under Jack's head for a pillow, \"but it has pretty\nnearly killed _you_.  Do you feel worse, Jack?\"\n\nI asked this in some alarm, observing that he had turned deadly pale\nagain.\n\n\"He's fainted, man; out o' the way!\" cried Peterkin, as he applied the\nbrandy again to his lips and temples.\n\nIn a few seconds Jack again rallied.\n\n\"Now, Mak, bestir yourself,\" cried Peterkin, throwing off his coat.\n\"Cut down two stout poles, and we'll make some sort of litter to carry\nhim on.\"\n\n\"I say, Ralph,\" whispered Jack faintly, \"do look to my wounds and see\nthat they are all tightly bound up.  I can't afford to lose another drop\nof blood.  It's almost all drained away, I believe.\"\n\nWhile I examined my friend's wounds and readjusted the bandages, my\ncompanions cut down two poles.  These we laid on the ground parallel to\neach other and about two feet apart, and across them laid our three\ncoats, which we fastened in a rough fashion by means of some strong\ncords which I fortunately happened to have with me.  On this rude litter\nwe laid our companion, and raised him on our shoulders.  Peterkin and I\nwalked in rear, each supporting one of the poles; while Makarooroo,\nbeing the stoutest of the three, supported the entire weight of the\nother ends on his broad shoulders.  Jack bore the moving better than we\nhad expected, so that we entertained sanguine hopes that no bones were\nbroken, but that loss of blood was all he had to suffer from.\n\nThus slowly and with much difficulty we bore our wounded comrade to the\ncamp.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nI DISCOVER A CURIOUS INSECT, AND PETERKIN TAKES A STRANGE FLIGHT.\n\nIt happened most fortunately at this time that we were within a short\nday's journey of a native village, to which, after mature consideration,\nwe determined to convey Jack, and remain there until he should be\nsufficiently recovered to permit of our resuming our journey.  Hitherto\nwe had studiously avoided the villages that lay in our route, feeling\nindisposed to encounter unnecessarily the risk of being inhospitably\nreceived--perhaps even robbed of our goods, if nothing worse should\nbefall us.  There was, however, no other alternative now; for Jack's\nwounds were very severe, and the amount of blood lost by him was so\ngreat that he was as weak as a child.  Happily, no bones were broken, so\nwe felt sanguine that by careful nursing for a few weeks we should get\nhim set firmly upon his legs again.\n\nOn the following morning we set forth on our journey, and towards\nevening reached the village, which was situated on the banks of a small\nstream, in the midst of a beautiful country composed of mingled plain\nand woodland.\n\nIt chanced that the chief of this village was connected by marriage with\nKing Jambai--a most fortunate circumstance for us, as it ensured our\nbeing hospitably received.  The chief came out to meet us riding on the\nshoulders of a slave, who, although a much smaller man than his master,\nseemed to support his load with much case.  Probably habit had\nstrengthened him for his special work.  A large hut was set apart for\nour accommodation; a dish of yams, a roast monkey, and a couple of fowls\nwere sent to us soon after our arrival, and, in short, we experienced\nthe kindest possible reception.\n\nNone of the natives of this village had ever seen a white face in their\nlives, and, as may well be imagined, their curiosity and amazement were\nunbounded.  The people came constantly crowding round our hut,\nremaining, however, at a respectful distance, and gazed at us until I\nbegan to fear they would never go away.\n\nHere we remained for three weeks, during which time Jack's wounds healed\nup, and his strength returned rapidly.  Peterkin and I employed\nourselves in alternately tending our comrade, and in scouring the\nneighbouring woods and plains in search of wild animals.\n\nAs we were now approaching the country of the gorilla--although, indeed,\nit was still far distant--our minds began to run more upon that terrible\ncreature than used to be the case; and our desire to fall in with it was\nincreased by the strange accounts of its habits and its tremendous power\nthat we received from the natives of this village, some of whom had\ncrossed the desert and actually met with the gorilla face to face.  More\nthan once, while out hunting, I have been so taken up with this subject\nthat I have been on the point of shooting a native who appeared\nunexpectedly before me, under the impression that he was a specimen of\nthe animal on which my thoughts had been fixed.\n\nOne day about a week after our arrival, as I was sitting at the side of\nJack's couch relating to him the incidents of a hunt after a buffalo\nthat Makarooroo and I had had the day before, Peterkin entered with a\nswaggering gait, and setting his rifle down in a corner, flung himself\non the pile of skins that formed his couch.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" said he, with the look and tone of a man who\nfeels that he has been unwarrantably misled--\"I don't believe there's\nsuch a beast as a gorilla at all; _now_, that's a fact.\"\n\nThere was something so confident and emphatic in my comrade's manner\nthat, despite my well-grounded belief on that point, I felt a sinking at\nthe heart.  The bare possibility that, after all our trouble and toil\nand suffering in penetrating thus far towards the land which he is said\nto inhabit, we should find that there really existed no such creature as\nthe gorilla was too terrible to think upon.\n\n\"Peterkin,\" said I anxiously, \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" replied he slowly, \"that Jack is the only living specimen of\nthe gorilla in Africa.\"\n\n\"Come, now, I see you are jesting.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" cried Peterkin savagely--\"jesting, eh?  That means expressing\nthoughts and opinions which are not to be understood literally.  Oh, I\nwould that I were sure that I am jesting!  Ralph, it's my belief, I tell\nyou, that the gorilla is a regular sell--a great, big, unnatural hairy\n_do_!\"\n\n\"But I saw the skeleton of one in London.\"\n\n\"I don't care for that.  You may have been deceived, humbugged.  Perhaps\nit was a compound of the bones of a buffalo and a chimpanzee.\"\n\n\"Nay, that were impossible,\" said I quickly; \"for no one pretending to\nhave any knowledge of natural history and comparative anatomy could be\nso grossly deceived.\"\n\n\"What like was the skeleton, Ralph?\" inquired Jack, who seemed to be\nrather amused by our conversation.\n\n\"It was nearly as tall as that of a medium-sized man--I should think\nabout five feet seven or eight inches; but the amazing part about it was\nthe immense size and thickness of its bones.  Its shoulders were much\nbroader than yours, Jack, and your chest is a mere child's compared with\nthat of the specimen of the gorilla that I saw.  Its legs were very\nshort--much shorter than those of a man; but its arms were tremendous--\nthey were more than a foot longer than yours.  In fact, if the brute's\nlegs were in the same proportion to its body as are those of a man, it\nwould be a giant of ten or eleven feet high.  Or, to take another view\nof it, if you were to take a robust and properly proportioned giant of\nthat height, and cut down his legs until he stood about the height of an\nordinary man, _that_ would be a gorilla.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" cried Peterkin.\n\n\"Well, perhaps my simile is not quite so felicitous as--\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" interrupted Peterkin; \"I mean that I don't believe\nthere's such a brute as a gorilla at all.\"\n\n\"Why, what has made you so sceptical?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"The nonsense that these niggers have been telling me, through the\nmedium of Mak as an interpreter; that is what has made me sceptical.\nOnly think, they say that a gorilla is so strong that he can lift a man\nby the nape of the neck clean off the ground with one of his hind feet!\nYes, they say he is in the habit of sitting on the lower branches of\ntrees in lonely dark parts of the wood watching for prey, and when a\nnative chances to pass by close enough he puts down his hind foot,\nseizes the wretched man therewith, lifts him up into the tree, and\nquietly throttles him.  They don't add whether or not he eats him\nafterwards, or whether he prefers him boiled or roasted.  Now, I don't\nbelieve that.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" returned Jack; \"nevertheless the fact that these fellows\nrecount such wonderful stories at all, is, to some extent, evidence in\nfavour of their existence: for in such a country as this, where so many\nwonderful and horrible animals exist, men are not naturally tempted to\ninvent _new_ creatures; it is sufficient to satisfy their craving for\nthe marvellous that they should merely exaggerate what does already\nexist.\"\n\n\"Go to, you sophist! if what you say be true, and the gorilla turns out\nto be only an exaggerated chimpanzee or ring-tailed roarer, does not\nthat come to the same thing as saying that there is no gorilla at all--\nalways, of course, excepting yourself?\"\n\n\"Credit yourself with a punched head,\" said Jack, \"and the account shall\nbe balanced when I am sufficiently recovered to pay you off.  Meanwhile,\ncontinue your account of what the niggers say about the gorilla.\"\n\nPeterkin assumed a look of offended dignity as he replied--\n\n\"Without deigning any rejoinder to the utterly absurd and totally\nirrelevant matter contained in the preliminary sentences of your last\nremark, I pass on to observe that the natives of these wilds hold the\nopinion that there is one species of the gorilla which is the residence\nof the spirits of defunct niggers, and that these fellows are known by\ntheir unusual size and ferocity.\"\n\n\"Hold,\" cried I, \"until I get out my note-book.  Now, Peterkin, no\nfibs.\"\n\n\"Honour bright,\" said he, \"I'll give it you just as I got it.  These\n_possessed_ brutes are never caught, and can't be killed.  (I only hope\nI may get the chance to try whether that be true or not.)  They often\ncarry off natives into the woods, where they pull out their toe and\nfinger nails by the roots and then let them go; and they are said to be\nuncommonly fond of sugar-cane, which they steal from the fields of the\nnatives sometimes in a very daring manner.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" said I.\n\n\"All!\" exclaimed my comrade.  \"How much more would you have?  Do you\nsuppose that the gorilla can do anything it likes--hang by its tail from\nthe moon, or sit down on its nose and run round on its chin?\"\n\n\"Massa Jack,\" said Makarooroo, entering the hut and interrupting our\nconversation at this point, \"de chief hims tell to me for to tell to you\ndat w'en you's be fit for go-hid agin hims gib you cottle for sit upon.\"\n\n\"Cottle, Mak! what's _cottle_?\" inquired Jack, with a puzzled look.\n\n\"Ho, massa, you know bery well; jist cottle--hoxes, you know.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I don't know,\" replied Jack, still more puzzled.\n\n\"I've no doubt,\" interposed Peterkin, \"that he means cuttle, which is\nthe short name for cuttle-fish, which, in such an inland place as this,\nmust of course be hoaxes!  But what do you mean, Mak?  Describe the\nthing to us.\"\n\nMak scratched his woolly pate, as if he were quite unable to explain\nhimself.\n\n\"O massas, you be most stoopid dis yer day.  Cottle not a ting; hims am\na beast, wid two horn an' one tail.  Dere,\" said he, pointing with\nanimation to a herd of cattle that grazed near our hut, \"dat's cottle,\nor hoxes.\"\n\nWe all laughed at this proposal.\n\n\"What!\" cried Jack, \"does he mean us to ride upon `hoxes' as if they\nwere horses?\"\n\n\"Yis, massa, hims say dat.  Hims hear long ago ob one missionary as hab\ndo dat; so de chief he tink it bery good idea, an' hims try too, an'\nlike it bery much; only hims fell off ebery tree steps an' a'most broke\nall de bones in him's body down to powder.  But hims git up agin and\nfell hoff agin.  Oh, hims like it bery much!\"\n\n\"If we follow the chief's example,\" said I, laughing, \"we shall scarcely\nbe in a fit state to hunt gorillas at the end of our journey; but now I\ncome to think of it, the plan seems to me not a bad one.  You know a\ngreat part of our journey now lies over a comparatively desert country,\nwhere we shall be none the worse of a ride now and then on ox-back to\nrelieve our limbs.  I think the proposal merits consideration.\"\n\n\"Right, Ralph,\" said Jack.--\"Go, Mak, and tell his majesty, or\nchieftainship, or his royal highness, with my compliments, that I am\nmuch obliged by the offer, and will consider it.  Also give him this\nplug of tobacco; and see you don't curtail its dimensions before it\nleaves your hand, you rascal.\"\n\nOur guide grinned as he left the hut to execute his mission, and we\nturned to converse on this new plan, which, the more we thought of it,\nseemed the more to grow in our estimation as most feasible.\n\n\"Now, lads, leave me,\" said Jack, with a sigh, after we had chatted for\nmore than an hour.  \"If I am to go through all that our worthy host\nseems to have suffered, it behoves me to get my frame into a fit state\nto stand it.  I shall therefore try to sleep.\"\n\nSo saying he turned round on his side, and we left him to his slumbers.\n\nAs it was still early in the afternoon, we two shouldered our rifles and\nstrolled away into the woods, partly with the intention of taking a shot\nat anything that might chance to come in our way, but chiefly with the\nview of having a pleasant chat about our prospect of speedily reaching\nthat goal of our ambition--the gorilla country.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" observed Peterkin, as we walked side by side over an\nopen grassy and flower-speckled plain that lay about a couple of miles\ndistant from the village--\"it seems to me that we shall _never_ reach\nthis far-famed country.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that we shall,\" said I; \"but tell me, Peterkin, do you\nreally doubt the existence of the gorilla?\"\n\n\"Well, since you do put it to me so very seriously, I can scarce tell\nwhat I believe.  The fact is, that I'm such a sceptical wretch by nature\nthat I find it difficult to believe anything unless I see it.\"\n\nI endeavoured to combat this very absurd state of mind in my companion\nby pointing out to him very clearly that if he were to act upon such a\nprinciple at all times, he would certainly disbelieve many of the\ncommonest facts in nature, and give full credit, on the other hand, to\nthe most outrageous absurdities.\n\n\"For instance,\" said I, \"you would believe that every conjurer swallows\nfire, and smoke, and penknives, and rabbits, because you _see_ him do\nit; and you would disbelieve the existence of the pyramids, because you\ndon't happen to have seen them.\"\n\n\"Ralph,\" said my companion seriously, \"don't go in too deep, else I\nshall be drowned!\"\n\nI was about to make some reply, when my attention was attracted by a\nvery singular appearance of moisture at the foot of a fig-tree under\nwhich we were passing.  Going up to it I found that there was a small\npuddle of clear water near the trunk.  This occasioned me much surprise,\nfor no rain had fallen in that district since our arrival, and probably\nthere had been none for a long period before that.  The ground\neverywhere, except in the large rivers and water-courses, was quite dry,\ninsomuch that, as I have said, this little solitary pool (which was not\nmuch larger than my hand) occasioned us much surprise.\n\n\"How comes it there?\" said I.\n\n\"That's more than I can tell,\" replied Peterkin.  \"Perhaps there's a\nsmall spring at the root of the tree.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there is,\" said I, searching carefully round the spot in all\ndirections; but I found nothing to indicate the presence of a spring--\nand, indeed, when I came to think of it, if there had been a spring\nthere would also certainly have been a water-course leading from it.\nBut such was not the case.  Presently I observed a drop of water fall\ninto the pool, and looking up, discovered that it fell from a cluster of\ninsects that clung to a branch close over our heads.\n\nI at once recognised this water-distilling insect as an old\nacquaintance.  I had seen it before in England, although of a\nconsiderably smaller size than this African one.  My companion also\nseemed to be acquainted with it, for he exclaimed--\n\n\"Ho!  I know the fellow.  He's what we used at home to call a\n`frog-hopper' after he got his wings, and a `cuckoo-spit' before that\ntime; but these ones are six times the size of ours.\"\n\nI was aware that there was some doubt among naturalists as to whence\nthese insects procured the water they distilled.  My own opinion,\nfounded on observations made at this time, led me to think the greater\npart of the moisture is derived from the atmosphere, though, possibly,\nsome of it may be procured by suction from the trees.  I afterwards paid\nseveral visits to this tree, and found, by placing a vessel beneath\nthem, that these insects distilled during a single night as much as\nthree or four pints of water!\n\nTurning from this interesting discovery, we were about to continue our\nwalk, when we observed a buffalo bull feeding in the open plain, not\nmore than five or six hundred yards off from us.\n\n\"Ha!  Ralph, my boy,\" cried Peterkin enthusiastically, \"here is metal\nmore attractive!  Follow me; we must make a detour in order to get to\nleeward of him.\"\n\nWe set off at a brisk pace, and I freely confess that, although the\ncontemplation of the curious processes of the water-distilling insect\nafforded me deeper and more lasting enjoyment, the gush of excitement\nand eagerness that instantly followed the discovery of the wild buffalo\nbull enabled me thoroughly to understand the feeling that leads men--\nespecially the less contemplative among them--infinitely to prefer the\npleasures of the chase to the calmer joys attendant upon the study of\nnatural history.\n\nAt a later period that evening I had a discussion with my companions on\nthat subject, when I stood up for the pursuit of scientific knowledge as\nbeing truly elevating and noble, while the pursuit of game was, to say\nthe least of it, a species of pleasure more suited to the tastes and\ncondition of the savage than of the civilised man.\n\nTo this Peterkin replied--having made a preliminary statement to the\neffect that I was a humbug--that a man's pluck was brought out and his\nnerves improved by the noble art of hunting, which was beautifully\nscientific in its details, and which had the effect of causing a man to\nact like a man and look like a man--not like a woman or a nincompoop, as\nwas too often the case with scientific men.\n\nHereupon Jack announced it as his opinion that we were both wrong and\nboth right; which elicited a cry of \"Bravo!\" from Peterkin.  \"For,\" said\nJack, \"what would the naturalist do without the hunter?  His museums\nwould be almost empty and his knowledge would be extremely limited.  On\nthe other hand, if there were no naturalists, the hunter--instead of\nbeing the hero who dares every imaginable species of danger, in order to\nprocure specimens and furnish information that will add to the sum of\nhuman knowledge--would degenerate into the mere butcher, who supplies\nhimself and his men with meat; or into the semi-murderer, who delights\nin shedding the blood of inferior animals.  The fact is, that the\nnaturalist and the hunter are indispensably necessary to each\nother--`both are best,' to use an old expression; and when both are\ncombined in one, as in the case of the great American ornithologist\nAudubon, that is best of all.\"\n\n\"Betterer than both,\" suggested Peterkin.\n\nBut to return from this digression.\n\nIn less than quarter of an hour we gained a position well to leeward of\nthe buffalo, which grazed quietly near the edge of the bushes, little\ndreaming of the enemies who were so cautiously approaching to work its\ndestruction.\n\n\"Keep well in rear of me, Ralph,\" said Peterkin, as we halted behind a\nbush to examine our rifles.  \"I'll creep as near to him as I can, and if\nby any chance I should not kill him at the first shot, do you run up and\nhand me your gun.\"\n\nWithout waiting for a reply, my companion threw himself on his breast,\nand began to creep over the plain like a snake in the grass.  He did\nthis so well and so patiently that he reached to within forty yards of\nthe bull without being discovered.  Then he ceased to advance, and I saw\nhis head and shoulders slowly emerge from among the grass, and presently\nhis rifle appeared, and was slowly levelled.  It was one of our\nlarge-bore single-barrelled rifles.\n\nHe lay in this position for at least two minutes, which seemed to me a\nquarter of an hour, so eager was I to see the creature fall.  Suddenly I\nheard a sharp snap or crack.  The bull heard it too, for it raised its\nhuge head with a start.  The cap of Peterkin's rifle had snapped, and I\nsaw by his motions that he was endeavouring, with as little motion as\npossible, to replace it with another.  But the bull caught sight of him,\nand uttering a terrific roar charged in an instant.\n\nIt is all very well for those who dwell at home in security to think\nthey know what the charge of an infuriated buffalo bull is.  Did they\nsee it in reality, as I saw it at that time, tearing madly over the\ngrass, foaming at the mouth, flashing at the eyes, tossing its tail, and\nbellowing hideously, they would have a very different idea from what\nthey now have of the trials to which hunters' nerves are frequently\nexposed.\n\nPeterkin had not time to cap.  He leaped up, turned round, and ran for\nthe woods at the top of his speed; but the bull was upon him in an\ninstant.  Almost before I had time to realise what was occurring, I\nbeheld my companion tossed high into the air.  He turned a distinct\nsomersault, and fell with a fearful crash into the centre of a small\nbush.  I cannot recall my thoughts on witnessing this.  I remember only\nexperiencing a sharp pang of horror and feeling that Peterkin must\ncertainly have been killed.  But whatever my thoughts were they must\nhave been rapid, for the time allowed me was short, as the bull turned\nsharp round after tossing Peterkin and rushed again towards the bush,\nevidently with the intention of completing the work of destruction.\n\nOnce again I experienced that strange and sudden change of feeling to\nwhich I have before referred.  I felt a bounding sensation in my breast\nwhich tingled to my finger-ends.  At the same time my head became clear\nand cool.  I felt that Providence had placed the life of my friend in my\nhands.  Darting forward in advance of the bush, I awaited the charge of\nthe infuriated animal.  On it came.  I knew that I was not a\nsufficiently good shot to make sure of hitting it in the brain.  I\ntherefore allowed it to come within a yard of me, and then sprang\nlightly to one side.  As it flew past, I never thought of taking aim or\nputting the piece to my shoulder, but I thrust the muzzle against its\nside and pulled both triggers at once.\n\nFrom that moment consciousness forsook me, and I knew not what had\noccurred for some minutes after.  The first object that met my confused\nvision when I again opened my eyes was Peterkin, who was seated close\nbeside me on the body of the dead buffalo, examining some bloody\nscratches on the calf of his left leg.  He had evidently been attempting\nto restore me to consciousness, for I observed that a wet handkerchief\nlay on my forehead.  He muttered to himself as he examined his wounds--\n\n\"This comes of not looking to one's caps.  Humph!  I do believe that\nevery bone in my body is--ah! here's another cut, two inches at least,\nand into the bone of course, to judge from the flow of blood.  I wonder\nhow much blood I can afford to lose without being floored altogether.\nSuch a country!  I wonder how high I went.  I felt as if I'd got above\nthe moon.  Hollo, Ralph! better?\"\n\nI sat up as he said this, and looked at him earnestly.\n\n\"My dear Peterkin, then you're not killed after all.\"\n\n\"Not quite, but pretty near.  If it had not been for that friendly bush\nI should have fared worse.  It broke my fall completely, and I really\nbelieve that my worst hurts are a few scratches.  But how are _you_,\nRalph?  Yours was a much more severe case than mine.  You should hold\nyour gun tighter, man, when you fire without putting it to your\nshoulder.\"\n\n\"How? why? what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Simply this, that in consequence of your reckless manner of holding\nyour rifle, it came back with such a slap on your chest that it floored\nyou.\"\n\n\"This, then, accounts for the pain I feel in it.  But come,\" said I,\nrising and shaking my limbs to make sure that no bones were broken; \"we\nhave reason to be very thankful we have escaped so easily.  I made sure\nthat you were killed when I saw you flying through the air.\"\n\n\"I always had a species of cat-luck about me,\" replied Peterkin, with a\nsmile.  \"But now let us cut off a bit o' this fellow to take back with\nus for Jack's supper.\"\n\nWith some difficulty we succeeded in cutting out the buffalo's tongue by\nthe root, and carried it back to the village, where, after displaying it\nas an evidence of our prowess, we had it cooked for supper.\n\nThe slight hurts that we had received at the time of this adventure were\nspeedily cured, and about two weeks after that we were all well enough\nto resume our journey.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN.\n\nWATER APPRECIATED--DESTRUCTIVE FILES, ETCETERA.\n\nOur first start from the village where we had been entertained so\nhospitably and so long was productive of much amusement to ourselves and\nto the natives.\n\nWe had determined to accept of three oxen from the chief, and to ride\nthese when we felt fatigued; but we thought it best to let our native\nporters carry our baggage on their shoulders, as they had hitherto done.\n\nWhen the animals were led up to our hut, we could not refrain from\nlaughing.  They were three sturdy-looking dark-skinned oxen, with\nwicked-looking black eyes and very long horns.\n\n\"Now, Jack, do you get up first,\" said Peterkin, \"and show us what we\nare to expect.\"\n\n\"Nay, lad; I am still entitled to be considered an invalid: so you must\nget up first, and not only so, but you must try them all, in order that\nI may be enabled to select the quietest.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, you are becoming despotic in your sickness, and you\nforget that it is but a short time since I came down from a journey to\nthe sky, and that my poor bones are still tender.  But here goes.  I was\nborn to be victimised, so I submit to the decrees of Fate.\"\n\nPeterkin went up to one of the oxen and attempted to mount it; but the\nanimal made a demonstration of an intention to gore him, and obstinately\nobjected to this.\n\n\"Hold him tight, Mak,\" he cried, after several futile attempts to mount.\n\"I was always good at leap-frog when a schoolboy; see if I don't bring\nmy powers into play now.\"\n\nSo saying, he went behind the ox, took a short race and sprang with the\nagility of a monkey over its tail on to its back!  The ox began to kick\nand sidle and plunge heavily on receiving this unexpected load; but its\nrider held on well, until it took it into its head to dart under a\nneighbouring tree, the lower branches of which swept him off and caused\nhim to fall with a heavy plump to the ground.\n\n\"I told you so,\" he cried, rising with a rueful face, and rubbing\nhimself as he limped forward.  However, his pain was more than half\naffected, for the next minute he was on the back of another ox.  This\none also proved restive, but not so much so as the first.  The third was\na very quiet animal, so Jack appropriated it as his charger.\n\nHaving bade adieu to the chief and rubbed noses with him and with\nseveral of our friends in the village, we all three got upon our novel\nsteeds and set forth.  But we had not got away from the village more\nthan a mile when the two restive oxen began to display a firm\ndetermination to get rid of their intolerable burden.  Mine commenced to\nback and sidle, and Peterkin's made occasional darts forward, and then\nstopping suddenly, refused to budge a step.  We lost all patience at\nlast, and belaboured them soundly with twigs, the effect of which was to\nmake them advance rather slowly, and evidently under protest.\n\n\"Look out for branches,\" cried Peterkin as we came up to a narrow belt\nof wood.\n\nI had scarcely time to raise my head when I was swept off my seat and\nhurled to the ground by a large branch.  Peterkin's attention was drawn\nto me, and his ox, as if aware of the fact, seized the opportunity to\nswerve violently to one side, thereby throwing its rider off.  Both\nanimals gave a bellow, as of triumph, erected their tails, and ran away.\nThey were soon recaptured, however, by our negroes; and mounting once\nmore, we belaboured them well and continued our journey.  In course of\ntime they became more reconciled to their duties; but I cannot say that\nI ever came to enjoy such riding, and all of us ultimately agreed that\nit was a most undesirable thing to journey on ox-back.\n\nThus we commenced our journey over this desert or plain of Africa, and\nat the end of many weeks found ourselves approaching that part of the\ncountry near the equator in which the gorilla is said to dwell.  On the\nway we had many adventures, some of an amusing, some of a dangerous\ncharacter, and I made many additions to my collection of animals,\nbesides making a number of valuable and interesting notes in my journal;\nbut all this I am constrained to pass over, in order to introduce my\nreader to those regions in which some of our most wonderful adventures\noccurred.\n\nOne or two things, however, I must not omit to mention.\n\nIn passing over the desert we suffered much from want of water.\nFrequently the poor oxen had to travel two or three days without tasting\na drop, and their distress was so great that we more than once thought\nof turning them adrift at the first good watering-place we should come\nto, and proceed, as formerly, on foot; for we had all recovered our\nwonted vigour, and were quite capable of standing the fatigues of the\njourney as well as our men.  But several times we had found the country\ndestitute of game, and were reduced to the point of starvation; so we\ncontinued to keep the oxen, lest we should require them for food.\n\nOn one occasion we were wending our way slowly along the bed of what in\nthe rainy season would become a large river, but which was now so\nthoroughly dry that we could not find even a small pool in which the\noxen might slake their thirst.  They had been several days absolutely\nwithout a drop of water, while we were reduced to a mouthful or two per\nman in the day.  As we could not exist much longer without the\nlife-giving fluid, Jack dismounted, and placing the load of one of the\nmen on the ox's back, sent him off in advance to look for water.  We had\nthat morning seen the footprints of several animals which are so fond of\nwater that they are never found at any great distance from some spot\nwhere it may be found.  We therefore felt certain of falling in with it\nere long.\n\nAbout two hours afterwards our negro returned, saying that he had\ndiscovered a pool of rain-water, and showing the marks of mud on his\nknees in confirmation of the truth of what he said.\n\n\"Ask him if there's much of it, Mak,\" said Jack, as we crowded eagerly\nround the man.\n\n\"Hims say there be great plenty ob it--'nuff to tumble in.\"\n\nGladdened by this news we hastened forward.  The oxen seemed to have\nscented the water from afar, for they gradually became more animated,\nand quickened their pace of their own accord, until they at last broke\ninto a run.  Peterkin and I soon outstripped our party, and quite\nenjoyed the gallop.\n\n\"There it is,\" cried my comrade joyfully, pointing to a gleaming pond in\na hollow of the plain not two hundred yards off.\n\n\"Hurrah!\"  I shouted, unable to repress my delight at the sight.\n\nThe oxen rushed madly forward, and we found that they were away with us.\nNo pulling at our rope-bridles had any effect on them.  My companion,\nforeseeing what would happen, leaped nimbly off just as he reached the\nmargin of the pond.  I being unable to collect my thoughts for the\nemergency, held on.  My steed rushed into the water up to the neck, and\nstumbling as he did so, threw me into the middle of the pond, out of\nwhich I scrambled amidst the laughter of the whole party, who came up\nalmost as soon as the oxen, so eager were they to drink.\n\nAfter appeasing our own thirst we stood looking at the oxen, and it\nreally did our hearts good to see the poor thirsty creatures enjoy\nthemselves so thoroughly.  They stood sucking in the water as if they\nmeant to drink up the whole pond, half shutting their eyes, which became\nmild and amiable in appearance under the influence of extreme\nsatisfaction.  Their sides, which had been for the last two days in a\nstate of collapse, began to swell, and at last were distended to such an\nextent that they seemed as if ready to burst.  In point of fact the\ncreatures were actually as full as they could hold; and when at length\nthey dragged themselves slowly, almost unwillingly, out of the pool, any\nsudden jerk or motion caused some of the water to run out of their\nmouths!\n\nSome time after that we were compelled to part with our poor steeds, in\nconsequence of their being bitten by an insect which caused their death.\n\nThis destructive fly, which is called tsetse, is a perfect scourge in\nsome parts of Africa.  Its bite is fatal to the horse, ox, and dog, yet,\nstrange to say, it is not so to man or to wild animals.  It is not much\nlarger than the common house-fly, and sucks the blood in the same manner\nas the mosquito, by means of a proboscis with which it punctures the\nskin.  When man is bitten by it, no more serious evil than slight\nitching of the part follows.  When the ox is bitten no serious effect\nfollows at first, but a few days afterwards a running takes place at the\neyes and nose, swellings appear under the jaw and on other parts of the\nbody, emaciation quickly follows, even although the animal may continue\nto graze, and after a long illness, sometimes of many weeks, it dies in\na state of extreme exhaustion.\n\nThe tsetse inhabits certain localities in great numbers, while other\nplaces in the immediate neighbourhood are entirely free.  Those natives,\ntherefore, who have herds of cattle avoid the dangerous regions most\ncarefully; yet, despite their utmost care, they sometimes come\nunexpectedly on the _habitat_ of this poisonous fly, and lose the\ngreater part of their cattle.\n\nWhen our poor oxen were bitten and the fatal symptoms began to appear,\nwe knew that their fate was sealed; so we conducted them into a pleasant\nvalley on which we chanced to alight, where there was plenty of grass\nand water, and there we left them to die.\n\nAnother incident occurred to us in this part of our journey which is\nworthy of record.\n\nOne day Peterkin and I had started before our party with our rifles, and\nhad gone a considerable distance in advance of them, when we\nunexpectedly came upon a band of natives who were travelling in an\nopposite direction.  Before coming up with their main body, we met with\none of their warriors, who came upon us suddenly in the midst of a\nwooded spot, and stood rooted to the earth with fear and amazement; at\nwhich, indeed, we were not much surprised, for as he had probably never\nseen white faces before, he must have naturally taken us for ghosts or\nphantoms of some sort.\n\nHe was armed with shield and spear, but his frame was paralysed with\nterror.  He seemed to have no power to use his weapons.  At first we\nalso stood in silent wonder, and returned his stare with interest; but\nafter a few seconds the comicality of the man's appearance tickled\nPeterkin so much that he burst into a fit of laughter, which had the\neffect of increasing the terror of the black warrior to such a degree\nthat his teeth began to chatter in his head.  He actually grew livid in\nthe face.  I never beheld a more ghastly countenance.\n\n\"I say, Ralph,\" observed my companion, after recovering his composure,\n\"we must try to show this fellow that we don't mean him any harm, else\nhe'll die of sheer fright.\"\n\nBefore I could reply, or any steps could be taken towards this end, his\nparty came up, and we suddenly found ourselves face to face with at\nleast a hundred men, all of whom were armed with spears or bows and\narrows.  Behind them came a large troop of women and children.  They\nwere all nearly naked, and I observed that they were blacker in the skin\nthan most of the negroes we had yet met with.\n\n\"Here's a pretty mess,\" said Peterkin, looking at me.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" said I.\n\n\"If we were to fire at them, I'd lay a bet they'd run away like the\nwind,\" replied my comrade; \"but I can't bear to think of shedding human\nblood if it can possibly be avoided.\"\n\nWhile we spoke, the negroes, who stood about fifty yards distant from\nus, were consulting with each other in eager voices, but never for a\nmoment taking their eyes off us.\n\n\"What say you to fire over their heads?\"  I suggested.\n\n\"Ready, present, then,\" cried Peterkin, with a recklessness of manner\nthat surprised me.\n\nWe threw forward our rifles, and discharged them simultaneously.\n\nThe effect was tremendous.  The whole band--men, women, and children--\nuttered an overwhelming shriek, and turning round, fled in mad confusion\nfrom the spot.  Some of the warriors turned, however, ere they had gone\nfar, and sent a shower of spears at us, one of which went close past my\ncheek.\n\n\"We have acted rashly, I fear,\" said I, as we each sought shelter behind\na tree.\n\nNo doubt the savages construed this act of ours into an admission that\nwe did not consider ourselves invulnerable, and plucked up courage\naccordingly, for they began again to advance towards us, though with\nhesitation.  I now saw that we should be compelled to fight for our\nlives, and deeply regretted my folly in advising Peterkin to fire over\ntheir heads; but happily, before blood was drawn on either side,\nMakarooroo and Jack came running towards us.  The former shouted an\nexplanation of who and what we were to our late enemies, and in less\nthan ten minutes we were mingling together in the most amicable manner.\n\nWe found that these poor creatures were starving, having failed to\nprocure any provisions for some time past, and they were then on their\nway to another region in search of game.  We gave them as much of our\nprovisions as we could spare, besides a little tobacco, which afforded\nthem inexpressible delight.  Then rubbing noses with the chief, we\nparted and went on our respective ways.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\n\nHOW WE MET WITH OUR FIRST GORILLA, AND HOW WE SERVED HIM.\n\n\"It never rains but it pours,\" is a true proverb.  I have often noticed,\nin the course of my observations on sublunary affairs, that events\nseldom come singly.  I have often gone out fishing for trout in the\nrivers of my native land, day after day, and caught nothing, while at\nother times I have, day after day, returned home with my basket full.\n\nAs it was in England, so I found it in Africa.  For many days after our\narrival in the gorilla country, we wandered about without seeing a\nsingle creature of any kind.  Lions, we ascertained, were never found in\nthose regions, and we were told that this was in consequence of their\nhaving been beaten off the field by gorillas.  But at last, after we had\nall, severally and collectively, given way to despair, we came upon the\ntracks of a gorilla, and from that hour we were kept constantly on the\n_qui vive_, and in the course of the few weeks we spent in that part of\nthe country, we \"bagged,\" as Peterkin expressed it, \"no end of\ngorillas\"--great and small, young and old.\n\nI will never forget the powerful sensations of excitement and anxiety\nthat filled our breasts when we came on the first gorilla footprint.  We\nfelt as no doubt Robinson Crusoe did when he discovered the footprint of\na savage in the sand.  Here at last was the indubitable evidence of the\nexistence and presence of the terrible animal we had come so far to see.\nHere was the footstep of that creature about which we had heard so many\nwonderful stories, whose existence the civilised world had, up to within\na very short time back, doubted exceedingly, and in regard to which,\neven now, we knew comparatively very little.\n\nMakarooroo assured us that he had hunted this animal some years ago, and\nhad seen one or two at a distance, though he had never killed one, and\nstated most emphatically that the footprint before us, which happened to\nbe in a soft sandy spot, was undoubtedly caused by the foot of a\ngorilla.\n\nBeing satisfied on this head, we four sat down in a circle round the\nfootprint to examine it, while our men stood round about us, looking on\nwith deep interest expressed in their dark faces.\n\n\"At last!\" said I, carefully brushing away some twigs that partly\ncovered the impression.\n\n\"Ay, at last!\" echoed Jack, while his eyes sparkled with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Ay,\" observed Peterkin, \"and a pretty big _last_ he must require, too.\nI shouldn't like to be his shoemaker.  What a thumb, or a toe.  One\ndoesn't know very well which to call it.\"\n\n\"I wonder if it's old?\" said I.\n\n\"As old as the hills,\" replied Peterkin; \"at least 50 I would judge from\nits size.\"\n\n\"You mistake me.  I mean that I wonder whether the footprint is old, or\nif it has been made recently.\"\n\n\"Him's quite noo,\" interposed our guide.\n\n\"How d'ye know, Mak?\"\n\n\"'Cause me see.\"\n\n\"Ay; but what do you see that enables you to form such an opinion?\"\n\n\"O Ralph, how can you expect a nigger to understand such a sentence as\nthat?\" said Jack, as he turned to Mak and added, \"What do you see?\"\n\n\"Me see one leetle stick brok in middel.  If you look to him you see him\nwhite and clean.  If hims was old, hims would be mark wid rain and\ndirt.\"\n\n\"There!\" cried Peterkin, giving me a poke in the side, \"see what it is\nto be a minute student of the small things in nature.  Make a note of\nit, Ralph.\"\n\nI did make a note of it mentally on the spot, and then proposed that we\nshould go in search of the gorilla without further delay.\n\nWe were in the midst of a dark gloomy wood in the neighbourhood of a\nrange of mountains whose blue serrated peaks rose up into the clouds.\nTheir sides were partly clothed with wood.  We were travelling--not\nhunting--at the time we fell in with the track above referred to, so we\nimmediately ordered the men to encamp where they were, while we should\ngo after the gorilla, accompanied only by Mak, whose nerves we could\ndepend on.\n\nShouldering our trusty rifles, and buckling tight the belts of our heavy\nhunting-knives, we sallied forth after the manner of American Indians,\nin single file, keeping, as may well be supposed, a sharp lookout as we\nwent along.  The fact was that long delay, frequent disappointment, and\nnow the near prospect of success, conspired together to fill us with a\nspecies of nervous excitement that caused us to start at every sound.\n\nThe woods here were pretty thick, but they varied in their character so\nfrequently that we were at one time pushing slowly among dense, almost\nimpenetrable underwood, at another walking briskly over small plains\nwhich were covered in many places with large boulders.  It was\naltogether a gloomy, savage-looking country, and seemed to me well\nsuited to be the home of so dreadful an animal.  There were few animals\nto be seen here.  Even birds were scarce, and a few chattering monkeys\nwere almost the only creatures that broke the monotonous silence and\nsolitude around us.\n\n\"What a dismal place!\" said Peterkin, in a low tone.  \"I feel as if we\nhad got to the fag-end of the world, as if we were about plunging into\nancient chaos.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed,\" I replied, \"a most dreary region.  I think that the\ngorillas will not be disturbed by many hunters with white faces.\"\n\n\"There's no saying,\" interposed Jack.  \"I should not wonder, now, if\nyou, Ralph, were to go home and write a book detailing our adventures in\nthese parts, that at least half the sportsmen of England would be in\nAfrica next year, and the race of gorillas would probably become\nextinct.\"\n\n\"If the sportsmen don't come out until I write a book about them, I fear\nthe gorillas will remain undisturbed for all time to come.\"\n\nAt that time, reader, I was not aware of the extreme difficulty that\ntravellers experience in resisting the urgent entreaties of admiring and\ntoo partial friends!\n\nPresently we came to a part of the forest where the underwood became so\ndense that we could scarcely make our way through it at all, and here we\nbegan for the first time to have some clearer conception of the immense\npower of the creature we were in pursuit of; for in order to clear its\nway it had torn down great branches of the trees, and in one or two\nplaces had seized young trees as thick as a man's arm, and snapped them\nin two as one would snap a walking-cane.\n\nFollowing the track with the utmost care for several miles, we at length\ncame to a place where several huge rocks lay among the trees.  Here,\nwhile we were walking along in silence, Makarooroo made a peculiar noise\nwith his tongue, which we knew meant that he had discovered something\nworthy of special attention, so we came to an abrupt pause and looked at\nhim.\n\n\"What is it, Mak?\" inquired Jack.\n\nThe guide put his finger on his mouth to impose silence, and stood in a\nlistening attitude with his eyes cast upon the ground, his nostrils\ndistended, and every muscle of his dusky frame rigid, as if he were a\nstatue of black marble.  We also listened attentively, and presently\nheard a sound as of the breaking of twigs and branches.\n\n\"Dat am be gorilla,\" said the guide, in a low whisper.\n\nWe exchanged looks of eager satisfaction.\n\n\"How shall we proceed, Mak?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"We mus' go bery slow, dis way,\" said the guide, imitating the process\nof walking with extreme caution.  \"No break leetle stick.  If you break\nleetle stick hims go right away.\"\n\nPromising Mak that we would attend to his injunctions most carefully, we\ndesired him to lead the way, and in a few minutes after came so near to\nwhere the sound of breaking sticks was going on that we all halted,\nfearing that we should scare the animal away before we could get a sight\nof it amongst the dense underwood.\n\n\"What can he be doing?\" said I to the guide, as we stood looking at each\nother for a few seconds uncertain how to act.\n\n\"Him's breakin' down branches for git at him's feed, s'pose.\"\n\n\"Do you see that?\" whispered Peterkin, as he pointed to an open space\namong the bushes.  \"Isn't that a bit o' the hairy brute?\"\n\n\"It looks like it,\" replied Jack eagerly.\n\n\"Cluck!\" ejaculated Makarooroo, making a peculiar noise with his tongue.\n\"Dat him.  Blaze away!\"\n\n\"But it may not be a mortal part,\" objected Peterkin.  \"He might escape\nif only wounded.\"\n\n\"Nebber fear.  Hims come at us if hims be wound.  Only we mus' be ready\nfor him.\"\n\n\"All ready,\" said Jack, cocking both barrels of his rifle.--\"Now,\nPeterkin, a good aim.  If he comes here he shall get a quietus.\"\n\nAll this was said in the lowest possible whispers.  Peterkin took a\nsteady aim at the part of the creature that was visible, and fired.\n\nI have gone through many wild adventures since then.  I have heard the\nroar of the lion and the tiger in all circumstances, and the laugh of\nthe hyena, besides many other hideous sounds, but I never in all my life\nlistened to anything that in any degree approached in thundering\nferocity the appalling roar that burst upon our ears immediately after\nthat shot was fired.  I can compare it to nothing, for nothing I ever\nheard was like it.  If the reader can conceive a human fiend endued with\na voice far louder than that of the lion, yet retaining a little of the\nintonation both of the man's voice and of what we should suppose a\nfiend's voice to be, he may form some slight idea of what that roar was.\nIt is impossible to describe it.  Perhaps Mak's expression in regard to\nit is the most emphatic and truthful: it was absolutely \"_horriboble_!\"\nEvery one has heard a sturdy, well-grown little boy, when being\nthrashed, howling at the very top of his bent.  If one can conceive of a\nfull-grown male giant twenty feet high pouring forth his whole soul and\nvoice with similarly unrestrained fervour, he may approximate to a\nnotion of it.\n\nAnd it was not uttered once or twice, but again and again, until the\nwhole woods trembled with it, and we felt as if our ears could not\nendure more of it without the tympanums being burst.\n\nFor several moments we stood motionless with our guns ready, expecting\nan immediate attack, and gazing with awe, not unmingled--at least on my\npart--with fear, at the turmoil of leaves and twigs and broken branches\nthat was going on round the spot where the monster had been wounded.\n\n\"Come,\" cried Jack at length, losing patience and springing forward; \"if\nhe won't attack us we must attack him.\"\n\nWe followed close on his heels, and next moment emerged upon a small and\ncomparatively open space, in the midst of which we found the gorilla\nseated on the ground, tearing up the earth with its hands, grinning\nhorribly and beating its chest, which sent forth a loud hollow sound as\nif it were a large drum.  We saw at once that both its thighs had been\nbroken by Peterkin's shot.\n\nOf all the hideous creatures I had ever seen or heard of, none came up\nin the least degree to this.  Apart altogether from its gigantic size,\nthis monster was calculated to strike terror into the hearts of\nbeholders simply by the expression of its visage, which was quite\nsatanic.  I could scarcely persuade myself that I was awake.  It seemed\nas if I were gazing on one of those hideous creatures one beholds when\noppressed with nightmare.\n\nBut we had little time to indulge in contemplation, for the instant the\nbrute beheld us it renewed its terrible roar, and attempted to spring\nup; but both its legs at once gave way, and it fell with a passionate\ngrowl, biting the earth, and twisting and tearing bunches of twigs and\nleaves in its fury.  Suddenly it rushed upon us rapidly by means of its\nfore legs or arms.\n\n\"Look out, Jack!\" we cried in alarm.\n\nJack stood like a rock and deliberately levelled his rifle.  Even at\nthis moment of intense excitement I could not help marvelling at the\ndiminutive appearance of my friend when contrasted with the gorilla.  In\nheight, indeed, he was of course superior, and would have been so had\nthe gorilla been able to stand erect, but his breadth of shoulder and\nchest, and his length and size of arm, were strikingly inferior.  Just\nas the monster approached to within three yards of him, Jack sent a ball\ninto its chest, and the king of the African woods fell dead at our feet!\n\nIt is impossible to convey in words an idea of the gush of mingled\nfeelings that filled our breasts as we stood beside and gazed at the\nhuge carcass of our victim.  Pity at first predominated in my heart,\nthen I felt like an accomplice to a murder, and then an exulting\nsensation of joy at having obtained a specimen of one of the rarest\nanimals in the world overwhelmed every other feeling.\n\nThe size of this animal--and we measured him very carefully--was as\nfollows:--\n\nHeight, 5 feet 6 inches; girth of the chest, 4 feet 2 inches; spread of\nits arms, 7 feet 2 inches.  Perhaps the most extraordinary measurement\nwas that of the great thumb of its hind foot, which was 5 and a half\ninches in circumference.  When I looked at this and at the great bunches\nof hard muscles which composed its brawny chest and arms, I could almost\nbelieve in the stories told by the natives of the tremendous feats of\nstrength performed by the gorilla.  The body of this brute was covered\nwith grey hair, but the chest was bare and covered with tough skin, and\nits face was intensely black.  I shuddered as I looked upon it, for\nthere was something terribly human-like about it, despite the\nbrutishness of its aspect.\n\n\"Now, I'll tell you what we shall do,\" said Jack, after we had completed\nour examination of the gorilla.  \"We will encamp where we are for the\nnight, and send Makarooroo back to bring our fellows up with the packs,\nso that you, Ralph, will be able to begin the work of skinning and\ncleaning the bones at once.  What say you?\"\n\n\"Agreed, with all my heart,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well, then,\" observed Peterkin, \"here goes for a fire, to begin with,\nand then for victuals to continue with.  By the way, what say you to a\ngorilla steak?  I'm told the niggers eat him.--Don't they, Mak?\"\n\n\"Yis, massa, dey does.  More dan dat, de niggers in dis part ob country\neat mans.\"\n\n\"Eat mans!\" echoed Peterkin in horror.\n\n\"Yis, eat mans, and womins, an' childerdens.\"\n\n\"Oh, the brutes!  But I don't believe you, Mak.  What are the villains\ncalled?\"\n\n\"Well, it not be easy for say what dem be called.  Miss'naries calls dem\ncanibobbles.\"\n\n\"Ho!\" shouted Peterkin, \"canibobbles? eh! well done.  Mak, I must get\nyou to write a new dictionary; I think it would pay!\"\n\n\"It won't pay to go on talking like this, though,\" observed Jack.\n\"Come, hand me the axe.  I'll fell this tree while you strike a light,\nPeterkin.--Be off with you, Mak.--As for Ralph, we must leave him to his\nnote-book; I see there is no chance of getting him away from his beloved\ngorilla till he has torn its skin from its flesh, and its flesh from its\nbones.\"\n\nJack was right.  I had now several long hours' work before me, which I\nknew could not be delayed, and to which I applied myself forthwith most\neagerly, while my comrades lit the fire and prepared the camp, and\nMakarooroo set off on his return journey to bring up the remainder of\nour party.\n\nThat night, while I sat by the light of the camp-fire toiling at my\ntask, long after the others had retired to rest, I observed the features\nof Jack and Peterkin working convulsively, and their hands clutching\nnervously as they slept, and I smiled to think of the battles with\ngorillas which I felt assured they must be fighting, and the enormous\n\"bags\" they would be certain to tell of on returning from the realms of\ndreamland to the regions of reality.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\n\nPETERKIN'S SCHOOLDAY REMINISCENCES.\n\nThe day following that on which we shot our first gorilla was a great\nand memorable day in our hunting career in Africa, for on that day we\nsaw no fewer than ten gorillas: two females, seven young ones--one of\nwhich was a mere baby gorilla in its mother's arms--and a huge lone\nmale, or bachelor gorilla, as Peterkin called him.  And of these we\nkilled four--three young ones, and the old bachelor.  I am happy to add\nthat I saved the lives of the infant gorilla and its mother, as I shall\npresently relate.\n\nThe portion of country through which we travelled this day was not so\nthickly wooded as that through which we had passed the day before, so\nthat we advanced more easily, and enjoyed ourselves much as we went\nalong.  About the middle of the day we came to a spot where there were a\nnumber of wild vines, the leaves of which are much liked by the gorilla,\nso we kept a sharp lookout for tracks.\n\nSoon we came upon several, as well as broken branches and twigs, in\nwhich were observed the marks of teeth, showing that our game had been\nthere.  But we passed from the wood where these signs were discovered,\nout upon an open plain of considerable extent.  Here we paused,\nundecided as to whether we should proceed onward or remain there to\nhunt.\n\n\"I vote for advancing,\" said Peterkin, \"for I observe that on the other\nside of this plain the wood seems very dense, and it is probable that we\nmay find Mister Gorilla there.--What think you, Mak?\"\n\nThe guide nodded in reply.\n\n\"I move,\" said Jack, \"that as the country just where we stand is well\nwatered by this little brook, besides being picturesque and beautiful to\nlook upon, we should encamp where we are, and leaving our men to guard\nthe camp, cross this plain--we three take Mak along with us, and spend\nthe remainder of the day in hunting.\"\n\n\"I vote for the amendment,\" said I.\n\n\"Then the amendment carries,\" cried Jack, \"for in all civilised\nsocieties most votes always carry; and although we happen to be in an\nuncivilised region of the earth, we must not forget that we are\ncivilised hunters.  The vote of two hunters ought certainly to override\nthat of one hunter.\"\n\nPeterkin demurred to this at once, on the ground that it was unfair.\n\n\"How so?\" said I.\n\n\"In the first place,\" replied he, looking uncommonly wise, and placing\nthe point of his right finger in the palm of his left hand--\"in the\nfirst place, I do not admit your premises, and therefore I object to\nyour conclusion.  I do not admit that in civilised societies most votes\ncarry; on the contrary, it too frequently happens that, in civilised\nsocieties, motions are made, seconded, discussed, and carried without\nbeing put to the vote at all; often they are carried without being made,\nseconded, or discussed--as when a bottle-nosed old gentleman in office\nchooses to ignore the rights of men, and carry everything his own way.\nNeither do I admit that we three are civilised hunters; for although it\nis true that I am, it is well-known that you, Ralph, are a philosopher,\nand Jack is a gorilla.  Therefore I object to your conclusion that your\ntwo votes should carry; for you cannot but admit that the vote of one\nhunter ought to override that of two such creatures, which would not be\nthe case were there an equality existing between us.\"\n\n\"Peterkin,\" said I, \"there is fallacy in your reasoning.\"\n\n\"Can you show it?\" said he.\n\n\"No; the web is too much ravelled to disentangle.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" cried Jack; \"I can unravel it in a minute, and settle the\nwhole question by proving that there does exist an equality between us;\nfor it is well-known, and generally admitted by all his friends, and\nmust be acknowledged by himself, that Peterkin is an ass.\"\n\n\"Even admitting that,\" rejoined Peterkin, \"it still remains to be proved\nthat a philosopher, a gorilla, and an ass are equal.  Of course I\nbelieve the latter to be superior to both the former animals; but in\nconsideration of the lateness of the hour, and the able manner in which\nyou have discussed this subject, I beg to withdraw my motion, and to\nstate that I am ready to accompany you over the plain as soon as you\nplease.\"\n\nAt this point our conversation was interrupted by the shriek of a small\nmonkey, which had been sitting all the time among the branches of the\ntree beneath which we stood.\n\n\"I declare it has been listening to us,\" cried Peterkin.\n\n\"Yes, and is shouting in triumph at your defeat,\" added Jack.\n\nAs he spoke, Makarooroo fired, and the monkey fell to the ground almost\nat our feet.\n\n\"Alas! it has paid a heavy price for its laugh,\" said Peterkin, in a\ntone of sadness.\n\nThe poor thing was mortally wounded; so much so that it could not even\ncry.  It looked up with a very piteous expression in our faces.  Placing\nits hand on its side, it coughed once or twice, then lying down on its\nback and stretching itself out quite straight, it closed its eyes and\ndied.\n\nI never could bear to shoot monkeys.  There was something so terribly\nhuman-like in their sufferings, that I never could witness the death of\none without feeling an almost irresistible inclination to weep.\nSometimes, when short of provisions, I was compelled to shoot monkeys,\nbut I did so as seldom as possible, and once I resolved to go supperless\nto bed rather than shoot one whose aspect was so sad and gentle that I\nhad not the heart to kill it.  My companions felt as I did in this\nmatter, and we endeavoured to restrain Makarooroo as much as possible;\nbut he could not understand our feelings, and when he got a chance of a\nshot, almost invariably forgot our injunctions to let monkeys alone\nunless we were absolutely ill off for food.  To do him justice, however,\nI must add that we were at this particular time not overburdened with\nprovisions, and the men were much pleased to have the prospect of a\nroast monkey for supper.\n\nHaving given our men a little tobacco, a gift which caused their black\nfaces to beam with delight, we shouldered our rifles and set off across\nthe plain towards the thick wood, which was not more than five miles\ndistant, if so much.\n\nIt was a beautiful scene, this plain with its clumps of trees scattered\nover it like islands in a lake, and its profusion of wild flowers.  The\nweather, too, was delightful--cooler than usual--and there was a\nfreshness in the air which caused us to feel light of heart, while the\ncomparative shortness of the grass enabled us to proceed on our way with\nlight steps.  As we walked along for some time in silence, I thought\nupon the goodness and the provident care of the Creator of our world;\nfor during my brief sojourn in Africa I had observed many instances of\nthe wonderful exactness with which things in nature were suited to the\ncircumstances in which they were placed, and the bountiful provision\nthat was made everywhere for man and beast.  Yet I must confess I could\nnot help wondering, and felt very much perplexed, when I thought of the\nbeautiful scenes in the midst of which I moved being inhabited only by\nsavage men, who seemed scarcely to appreciate the blessings by which\nthey were surrounded, and who violated constantly all the laws of Him by\nwhom they were created.  My meditations were interrupted by Jack\nsaying--\n\n\"I cannot help wondering why that poor monkey kept so still all the time\nwe were talking.  One would think that it should have been frightened\naway just as we came under the tree.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" said I, \"that although of course it could not\nunderstand what we said, yet it was listening to us.\"\n\n\"I'm not so certain that it did not understand,\" observed Peterkin.\n\"You know that sailors believe that monkeys could speak if they chose,\nbut they don't for fear that they should be made to work!\"\n\n\"Well, whatever truth there may be in that, of this I am certain, they\nare the most deceptive creatures that exist.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" rejoined Peterkin.  \"It's my opinion that\nlittle boys are the greatest deceivers living.\"\n\n\"What! _all_ little boys!\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"No, not all.  I have not so bad an opinion of the race as that.  I've\nhad a good deal to do with boys during my naval career, and among the\nmiddies of her Majesty's navy I have met with as fine little chaps as\none would wish to see--regular bricks, afraid of nothing (except of\ndoing anything that would be thought sneaking or shabby), ready to dare\nanything--to attack a seventy-four single-handed in a punt or a bumboat\nif need be; nevertheless, I've met boys, and a good many of them too,\nwho would beat all the monkeys in Africa at sneaking and deceiving.  I\nremember one rascal, who went to the same school with me, who was a\nwonderfully plausible deceiver.  I can't help laughing yet when I think\nof the curious way he took to free himself of the restraint of school.\"\n\n\"How was it?\" cried Jack; \"tell us about it--do.\"\n\n\"Well, you must know,\" began Peterkin, \"that this boy was what Jack tars\nwould call a `great, stupid, lubberly fellow.'  He was a very\nfair-haired, white eyelashed sort of chap, that seemed to grow at such a\nrate that he was always too big for his clothes, and showed an unusual\namount of wrist and ankle even for a boy.  Most people who met him\nthought him a very stupid boy at first; but those who came to know him\nwell found that he was rather a sharp, clever fellow, but a remarkably\nshy dog.  We called him Doddle.\n\n\"His mother was a widow, and he was an only son, and had been spoiled,\nof course, so that he was not put to school till he was nearly twelve\nyears of age.  He had been at several schools before coming to ours, but\nhad been deemed by each successive schoolmaster a hopeless imbecile.\nAnd he was so mischievous that they advised his poor mother to take him\naway and try if she could not instil a little knowledge into him\nherself.  The old lady was a meek, simple body, and quite as stupid as\nher hopeful son appeared to be.  Hearing that our master was a sharp\nfellow, and somewhat noted as a good manager of obstreperous boys, she\nbrought him to our school as a last resource, and having introduced him\nto the master, went her way.\n\n\"It was near the end of play-hour when she brought him, so he was turned\nout into the playground, and stood there looking like a mongrel cur\nturned unexpectedly into a kennel of pointers.\n\n\"`Well, Doddle,' said one of the sixth-form boys, going up to him and\naddressing him for the first time by the name which stuck to him ever\nafter, `where did _you_ grow; and who cut you down and tossed you in\nhere?'\n\n\"`Eh?' said Doddle, looking sheepish.\n\n\"`What's your name, man, and where did you come from, and how old are\nyou, and how far can you jump without a race? and in fact I want to know\nall about you.'\n\n\"`My name's Tommy Thompson,' replied the boy, `and I--'\n\n\"At that moment the bell rang, and the remainder of his sentence was\ndrowned in the rush of the rest of us to the classroom.\n\n\"When all was quiet the master called Doddle up, and said, `Well,\nThompson, my boy, your mother tells me you have learned a little grammar\nand a little arithmetic.  I hope that we shall instil into you a good\ndeal of those branches of learning, and of many others besides, ere\nlong.  Let me hear what you can do.'\n\n\"`I can play hockey and dumps,' began Doddle, in a sing-song tone, and\nwith the most uncommonly innocent expression of visage; `an' I can--'\n\n\"`Stay, boy,' interrupted the master, smiling; `I do not want to know\nwhat you can _play_ at.  Keep silence until I put a few questions to\nyou.  What is English grammar?'\n\n\"`Eh?'\n\n\"`Don't say \"Eh!\"  When you fail to understand me, say \"Sir?\"\ninterrogatively.  What is English grammar?'\n\n\"`It's a book.'\n\n\"The master looked over the top of his spectacles at Doddle in surprise.\n\n\"`English grammar,' said he, slowly, and with a slight touch of\nsternness, `is indeed contained in a book; but I wish to know what it\nteaches.'\n\n\"`Eh?--a--I mean sir interrogatively.'\n\n\"`What does English grammar _teach_, boy?' cried the master angrily.\n\n\"Doddle laid hold of his chin with his right hand, and looked down at\nthe floor with an air of profound thought, saying slowly, in an\nundertone to himself, `What--does--English--grammar--teach--teach--\ngrammar--teach?  It--teaches--a--I don't know _what_ it teaches.\nPerhaps you can tell me, sir?'\n\n\"He looked up, and uttered the last sentence with such an air of blank\nhumility that we all had to cram our pocket handkerchiefs into our\nmouths to prevent a universal explosion.  The master looked over his\nspectacles again at Doddle with an expression of unutterable amazement.\nWe looked on with breathless interest, not unmingled with awe, for we\nexpected some awful outbreak on the part of the master, who seemed quite\nunable to make up his mind what to do or say, but continued to stare for\nnearly a minute at the boy, who replied to the stare with a humble,\nidiotic smile.\n\n\"Suddenly the master said sharply, `How much are seven times nine?'\n\n\"`Five hundred and forty-two and a half,' answered Doddle, without a\nmoment's hesitation.\n\n\"The master did not look surprised this time, but he took Doddle by the\nshoulder, and drawing him towards his chair, looked earnestly into his\nface.  Then he said quietly, `That will do, Thompson; go to your seat.'\n\n\"This was all that occurred at that time.  During a whole week the\nmaster tried by every means to get Doddle to learn something; but Doddle\ncould learn nothing.  Yet he seemed to try.  He pored over his book, and\nmuttered with his lips, and sometimes looked anxiously up at the\nceiling, with an expression of agony on his face that seemed to indicate\na tremendous mental effort.  Every species of inducement was tried, and\noccasionally punishment was resorted to.  He was kept in at play-hours,\nand put in a corner during school-hours; and once, the master having\nlost patience with him, he was flogged.  But it was all one to Doddle.\nAll the methods tried proved utterly unavailing.  He could not be got to\nacquire a single lesson, and often gave such remarkable answers that we\nall believed him to be mad.\n\n\"On the Monday forenoon of his second week at the school, the master\ncalled him up again for examination.\n\n\"`Now, Thompson,' he began, `you have been a long time over that lesson;\nlet us see how much of it you have learned.  What is etymology?'\n\n\"`Etymology,' answered Doddle, `is--is--an irregular pronoun.'\n\n\"`Boy!' cried the master sternly.\n\n\"`Please, sir,' pleaded Doddle, with deprecatory air, `I--I suppose I\nwas thinkin' o' one o' the _other_ mologies, not the etty one.'\n\n\"`Ha!' ejaculated the master; `well, tell me, how many parts of speech\nare there?'\n\n\"`Nineteen,' answered the boy, quite confidently.\n\n\"`Oh!' exclaimed the master, with a good deal of sarcasm in his tone;\n`pray, name them.'\n\n\"In a very sing-song voice, and with an air of anxious simplicity,\nDoddle began, `Article, noun, adjective, pronoun, verb, adverb,\npreposition, conjunction, interjection, outerjection, beginning with\n_ies_ in the plural--as, baby, babies; lady, ladies; hady, hadies.\nPlease, sir, isn't that last one a _bad_ word?'\n\n\"`The boy is a lunatic!' muttered the master.\n\n\"The boys in the class were far past laughing now; we were absolutely\nstunned.  The master seemed perplexed, for Doddle was gazing at him with\na look of mild self-satisfaction.\n\n\"`I say, Peterkin,' whispered the boy next to me, `as sure as you're\nalive that boy's shamming stupid.'\n\n\"Presently the master, who had been turning over the leaves of the\ngrammar in a way that showed he was not conscious of what he was about,\nlooked up, and said abruptly, `What is a proper noun?'\n\n\"`A well-behaved one,' replied Doddle.\n\n\"At this the whole school tittered violently.\n\n\"`Silence, boys,' cried the master, in a tone that produced the desired\neffect so thoroughly that you might have heard a pin drop.  Then laying\nhis hand on Doddle's shoulder, he looked him full in the face, and said\nsolemnly, `Thompson, _I have found you out_.  Go, sir, to your seat, and\nremain behind when the other boys go to the playground.'\n\n\"We observed that Doddle grew very red in the face as he came back to\nhis seat, and during the rest of the hour he never once looked up.\n\n\"During the whole of the play-hour the master and he remained shut up\ntogether in the schoolroom.  We never discovered what took place there\nbetween them, for neither threats nor coaxing could induce Doddle\nafterwards to speak on the subject; but from that day forward he was a\nchanged boy.  He not only learned his lessons, but he learned them well,\nand in the course of time became one of the best scholars in the school;\nso that although he never would admit it, we all came to the conclusion\nhe had been shamming stupid--attempting to deceive the master into the\nbelief that he was incurable, and thus manage to get rid of lessons and\nschool altogether.\"\n\n\"A most remarkable boy,\" observed Jack when Peterkin concluded.\n\"Certainly he beat the monkeys hollow.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said I, \"what the master said or did to him that wrought\nsuch a mighty change.\"\n\n\"Don't know,\" replied Peterkin; \"I suppose he told him that now he had\nfound him out, he would flay him alive if he didn't give in, or\nsomething of that sort.\"\n\nWe had now entered the dark forest that edged the plain over which we\nhad been walking, and further conversation on this subject was stopped,\nand the subject itself banished utterly from our minds by the loud,\nstartling cry of a gorilla at no great distance from us.\n\n\"Hist! that's him,\" whispered Peterkin.\n\nInstantly throwing our rifles into a position of readiness we pushed\nrapidly through the underwood in the direction whence the cry had come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\n\nWE GET INTO \"THE THICK OF IT\"--GREAT SUCCESS.\n\nIn a few minutes we came upon a female gorilla, which, all unconscious\nof our approach, was sitting at the foot of a vine, eating the leaves.\nThere were four young ones beside her, engaged in the same occupation.\nIn order to approach within shot of these, we had to creep on all fours\nthrough the brushwood with the greatest caution; for gorillas are\nsharp-sighted, and they have a remarkably acute sense of hearing, so\nthat sometimes the breaking of a dry twig under one's foot is sufficient\nto alarm them.\n\nWe did not venture to speak even in whispers as we advanced; but by a\nsign Jack told Peterkin to take the lead.  Jack himself followed.\nMakarooroo went next, and I brought up the rear.\n\nIn all our hunting expeditions we usually maintained this arrangement,\nwhere it was necessary.  Peterkin was assigned the post of honour,\nbecause he was the best shot; Jack, being next best, came second; and I\ncame last, not because our guide was a better shot than I, but because\nhe was apt to get excited and to act rashly, so that he required looking\nafter.  I was at all times ready to lay hold of him by the hair of his\nwoolly head, which, as he was nearly naked, was the only part of him\nthat one could grasp with any degree of firmness.\n\nAfter creeping in this manner for some distance, we got within range.\nPeterkin and Jack took aim and fired together.  The old gorilla and one\nof the young ones fell instantly, and from their not struggling it was\nevident that they were shot quite dead.  The guide and I fired\nimmediately after, but only the one that I fired at fell.  The other two\nran off as fast as they could.  Sometimes they ran on all fours; and I\nobserved that while running in this fashion the hind legs passed between\nthe arms, or, as it were, overstepped them.  Occasionally, however, they\nrose and ran on their hind legs, in a stooping position.\n\nWhen they did this I was particularly struck with their grotesque yet\nstrong resemblance to man, and I do not think that I could at that time\nhave prevailed upon myself to fire at them.  I should have felt like a\nmurderer.  In truth, my thoughts and sensations just then were anything\nbut agreeable.  Nevertheless I was so excited by the chase that I am\nquite certain no one, to look at me, could have guessed what was passing\nin my mind.\n\nWe ran as rapidly as was possible in such a tangled forest, but we had\nno chance with the young gorillas.  Peterkin at last ran himself out of\nbreath.  Stopping suddenly, he said, pantingly--\n\n\"It's--o'--no use whatever.  Ho! dear me, my bellows are about\nexploded.\"\n\n\"We've no chance in a race with these hairy men,\" responded Jack, as he\nwiped the perspiration from his forehead.--\"Why did you miss, Mak?\"\n\n\"'Cause me no could hit, s'pose, massa.\"\n\n\"Very justly and modestly said,\" remarked Peterkin, with an approving\nnod.  \"'Tis a pity that men are not more generally animated with your\nspirit, Mak.  Most people, when they do wrong or make a mistake, are too\napt to try to excuse themselves.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I added, with a laugh; \"particularly when they blow the tails out\nof ostriches.\"\n\nPeterkin shook his head, and said solemnly, \"Ralph, my boy, don't take\nto joking.  It don't agree with your constitution.  You'll get ill if\nyou do; and we can't afford to have you laid up on our hands in these\nout-o'-the-way regions.\"\n\n\"Come, now, let us back to the gorillas and secure them, lest their\ncomrades carry them away,\" said Jack, turning to retrace our steps.\n\nI was anxious to shoot as many gorillas as possible, in order that I\nmight study the peculiarities of, and differences existing between, the\ndifferent species--if there should be such--and between various\nindividuals of the same species in all stages of development.  I had\nmade an elaborate examination of our first gorilla, and had taken\ncopious notes in regard to it.  Being desirous of doing the same as far\nas possible with the female and the two young ones we had just killed, I\nhastened back with my companions, and we fastened them securely among\nthe branches of a conspicuous tree, intending to send out some of our\nmen for them on our return to camp.\n\nAfter this we resumed our search for more, but wandered about for\nseveral hours without meeting with any, although we observed\nrecently-made footprints in abundance.  We went as nearly as possible in\na direction parallel to our camp, so that although we walked far we did\nnot increase our distance from it to any great extent.\n\nPresently Makarooroo made a peculiar \"cluck\" with his tongue, and we all\ncame to an abrupt stand.\n\n\"What is't, Mak?\"\n\nThe negro did not speak, but pointed eagerly in front of him, while the\nwhites of his eyes seemed to sparkle with animation, and raised his gun\nto shoot.\n\nWe came up at the moment, and through an opening in the bushes saw what\nhe was about to fire at.  It was a female gorilla, with a baby gorilla\nin her arms.  Fierce and hairy though she was, there was a certain air\nof tenderness about this mother, as she stroked and pawed her little\none, that went straight to my heart, and caused me almost involuntarily\nto raise my arm and strike up the muzzle of Makarooroo's gun, at the\nmoment he pulled the trigger.  The consequence of this act was that the\nball passed close over their heads.  The report of the piece was\ninstantly followed by a roar of consternation, mingled with rage, from\nthe mother, and a shriek of terror from the baby, which again was\nimmediately followed by a burst of laughter from us, as we beheld the\nlittle baby clasp its arms tightly round its mother, while she scampered\nwildly away from us.\n\nMak looked at me in amazement.\n\n\"What for you be do dat, massa?\"\n\n\"To prevent you from committing murder, you rascal,\" said I, laughing.\n\"Have you no feelings of natural pity or tenderness, that you could\ncoolly aim at such a loving pair as that?\"\n\nThe guide seemed a little put out by this remark, and went on reloading\nhis gun without making reply.  He had received enough of moral education\nat the mission stations to appreciate to some extent the feelings by\nwhich I was actuated; yet he had been so long accustomed and so early\ninured to harsh, unfeeling deeds, that the only idea that probably\noccurred to him on seeing this mother and her baby was, how near he\ncould get to them in order to make sure of his aim.\n\n\"Ah!  Ralph,\" said Jack, as we resumed our march, \"you're too\ntender-hearted, my boy, for a hunter in Africa.  There you've lost a\nchance of getting a gorilla baby, which you have been desiring so much\nthe last few days, and which you might have stuck in a bottle of\nspirits, and sent home to be held up to universal admiration in\nPiccadilly, who knows.\"\n\n\"Ay, who knows?\" echoed Peterkin.  \"I think it more probable, however,\nthat it would be held up to universal ridicule.  Besides, you forget\nthat we have no spirits to preserve it in, except our own, which I admit\nare pretty high--a good deal overproof, considering the circumstances in\nwhich we are placed, and the unheard-of trials we have to endure.  I'm\nsure I don't know what ever induced me to come, as a Scotch cousin of\nmine once said, `so far frae my ain fireside' to endure trials.  I do\nbelieve I've had more trials since I came to this outrageous land than\nall the criminals of the last century in England put together have had.\"\n\n\"Peterkin,\" said I seriously, \"trials are a decided benefit and blessing\nto mankind--\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" interrupted Peterkin; \"but then, as you have often\nretorted upon me that I am of the monkey kind, I think that I could get\non pretty well without them.\"\n\n\"My opinion is that they are good both for man and monkey,\" said Jack.\n\"Just consider, now: it must have been a terrible trial for yon\ngorilla-mamma to hear a bullet pass within an inch of her head, and have\nher sweet little darling frightened almost out of its wits.  Well, but\njust think of the state of satisfaction and rejoicing that she must be\nin now at having escaped.  Had it not been for that trial she would now\nhave been in her ordinary humdrum condition.  I quite agree with Ralph\nthat trials are really a blessing to us.\"\n\n\"I declare it is quite refreshing to hear that you `agree' with anybody,\nJack,\" rejoined Peterkin, in a tone of sarcasm.--\"Perhaps Mr Rover will\nkindly enlarge on this most interesting subject, and give us the benefit\nof his wisdom.--And, Mak, you lump of ebony, do you keep a sharp lookout\nfor gorillas in the meantime.\"\n\nThe guide, whose appreciation of fun was very considerable, said, \"Yis,\nmassa,\" grinned from ear to ear, in doing which he displayed a double\nrow of tremendous white teeth, and pretended to be gazing earnestly\namong the bushes on either side in search of game, as he followed us.\nThe moment we began to talk, however, I observed that he came close up\nbehind, and listened with all his ears.  If eager expansion indicates\nanything, I may add that he listened with all his eyes too!\n\n\"I shall have much pleasure in obliging you, Peterkin,\" said I, with a\nsmile.  \"And in the first place--\"\n\n\"O Ralph, I entreat you,\" interrupted Peterkin, \"do not begin with a\n`_first place_.'  When men begin a discourse with that, however many\nintermediate places they may have to roam about in and enlarge on, they\nnever have a place of any kind to terminate in, but go skimming along\nwith a couple of dozen `lastlies,' like a stone thrown over the surface\nof a pond, which, after the first two or three big and promising bounds,\nspends itself in an endless succession of twittering ripples, and\nfinally sinks, somehow or nohow, into oblivion.\"\n\n\"Ahem!  Shakespeare?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Not at all,\" retorted Peterkin.  \"If anybody gave utterance to the\nsentiment before, it was Shelley, and he must have been on the sea-shore\nat the time with a crotchet, if not a crab, inside of him.--But pray go\non, Ralph.\"\n\n\"Well, then, in the _first place_,\" I repeated with emphasis, whereat\nPeterkin sighed, \"trials, when endured in a proper spirit, improve our\nmoral nature and strengthen our hearts; the result of which is, that we\nare incited to more vigorous mental, and, by consequence, physical\nexertion, so that our nervous system is strengthened and our muscular\npowers are increased.\"\n\n\"Very well put, indeed,\" cried Peterkin.  \"Now, Ralph, try to forget\nyour `secondly,' omit your `thirdly,' throw your `fourthly' to the\nwinds, and let your `first place' be your `last place,' and I'll give\nyou credit for being a wise and effective speaker.\"\n\nI gave in to my volatile friend at that time, as I saw that he would not\nallow me to go on, and, to say truth, I thought that I had exhausted my\nsubject.  But, after all, Peterkin did not require to be incited either\nto good thoughts or good actions.  With all his exuberant fun and\njocularity, he was at bottom one of the most earnest and attached\nfriends I ever possessed.  I have lived to know that his superficial\nlightness of character overlaid as deeply earnest and sympathetic a\nspirit as ever existed.\n\nWhile we were thus conversing and wandering through the forest, we again\ncame upon the fresh tracks of a gorilla, and from their great size we\nconjectured them to be those of a solitary male.  It is a remarkable\nfact that among several of the lower animals we find specimens of that\nunnatural class of creatures which among men are termed old bachelors!\nAmong the gorillas these _solitaires_ are usually very large, remarkably\nfierce, uncommonly ugly, desperately vindictive, and peculiarly\ncourageous; so much so that the natives hold them in special dread.  It\nis of these wild men of the woods that their most remarkable and\nincredible stories are related.\n\n\"I don't think it's a gorilla at all,\" said Jack, stooping down to\nexamine the footprints, which in that place were not very distinct; \"I\nthink an elephant or a rhinoceros must have passed this way.\"\n\n\"No, massa, them's not deep 'nuff for dat.  Hims be a gorilla--a bery\nbig one, too.\"\n\n\"Don't let us talk then, lest we should scare it,\" whispered Peterkin.\n\"Lead the way, Mak; and mind, when we come close enough, move your great\ncarcass out of the way and let me to the front.\"\n\n\"No, no, lad,\" said Jack.  \"Fair play.  It's my turn now.\"\n\n\"So be it, my boy.  But get on.\"\n\nThe tracks led us a considerable distance deeper into the wood, where\nthe trees became so thick that only a species of twilight penetrated\nthrough them.  To add to our discomfort, the light, we knew, would soon\nfail us altogether, as evening was drawing on apace, so we quickened our\npace to a smart run.\n\nWe had not proceeded far when we were brought to a sudden standstill by\none of those awfully loud and savage roars which we at once recognised\nas being that of a gorilla.  It sounded like what we might term barking\nthunder, and from its intensity we were assured that our conjectures as\nto the creature being a solitary male gorilla were correct.\n\n\"Dat him, massas!\" cried our guide quickly, at the same time cocking\nboth barrels of his rifle.  \"Look hout! we no hab go after him no more.\nHim's come to fight us.  Most always doos dot--de big ole gorilla.\"\n\nWe saw from the deeply earnest expression of the negro's countenance\nthat he felt himself now to be in a very serious position, which would\ndemand all his nerve and coolness.\n\nAgain the roar was repeated with terrible loudness and ferocity, and we\nheard something like the beating of a huge bass drum, mingled with the\ncracking of branches, as though some heavy creature were forcing its way\nthrough the underwood towards us.\n\nWe were all much impressed with this beating sound, and, as is often the\ncase when men are startled by sounds which they cannot account for, we\nwere more filled with the dread of this incomprehensible sound than of\nthe gorilla which we knew was approaching us.  We might, indeed, have\nasked an explanation from Makarooroo, but we were all too much excited\nand anxious just then to speak.\n\nWe drew together in a group.\n\nJack, who stood a little in front of us, having claimed the first shot,\nwas whispering something about its being a pity there was so little\nlight, when his voice was drowned by a repetition of the roar, so\nappalling that we each started, feeling as though it had been uttered\nclose to our ears.  Next instant the bushes in front of us were torn\naside, and the most horrible monster I ever saw, or hope to set eyes on,\nstood before us.\n\nHe was evidently one of the largest-sized gorillas.  In the gloom of the\nforest he appeared to us to be above six feet high.  His jet-black\nvisage was working with an expression of rage that was fearfully\nsatanic.  His eyes glared horribly.  The tuft of hair on the top of his\nhead rose and fell with the working of his low wrinkled forehead in a\nmanner that peculiarly enhanced the ferocity of his expression.  His\ngreat hairy body seemed much too large for his misshapen legs, and his\nenormous arms much too long for the body.  It was with the fists at the\nends of those muscular arms that he beat upon his bulky chest, and\nproduced the unaccountable sounds above referred to.  As he stood there\nuttering roar upon roar--apparently with the view of screwing up his\ncourage to attack us--displaying his great canine teeth, and advancing\nslowly, step by step, I felt a mingling of powerful emotions such as I\nhad never felt before in all my life, and such as cannot by any\npossibility be adequately described.\n\nI felt quite self-possessed, however, and stood beside my comrades with\nmy rifle ready and my finger on the trigger.\n\n\"Now!\" whispered Peterkin.  But Jack did not move.\n\n\"Now!\" said he again, more anxiously, as the immense brute advanced,\nbeating its chest and roaring, to within eight yards of us.  Still Jack\ndid not move, and I observed that it was as much as Peterkin could do to\nrestrain himself.\n\nAs it took the next step, and appeared about to spring, Jack pulled the\ntrigger.  The cap alone exploded!  Like a flash of light the other\ntrigger was pulled; it also failed! some moisture must have got into the\nnipples in loading.  Almost as quick as thought Jack hurled his piece at\nthe brute with a force that seemed to me irresistible.  The butt struck\nit full in the chest, but the rifle was instantly caught in its iron\ngripe.  At that moment Peterkin fired, and the gorilla dropped like a\nstone, uttering a heavy groan as it fell prone with its face to the\nearth--not, however, before it had broken Jack's rifle across, and\ntwisted the barrel as if it had been merely a piece of wire!\n\n\"That was a narrow escape, Jack,\" said I seriously, after we had\nrecovered from the state of agitation into which this scene had thrown\nus.\n\n\"Indeed it was; and thanks to Peterkin's ever-ready rifle that it was an\nescape at all.  What a monstrous brute!\"\n\n\"Much bigger than the first one,\" said Peterkin.--\"Where is your\nmeasure, Ralph?  Out with it.\"\n\nI pulled out my measure, and applying it to the prostrate carcass, found\nthat the gorilla we had now shot was five feet eight inches in height,\nand proportionately large round the chest.  It seemed to be a mass of\nsinews and hard muscles, and as I gazed at its massive limbs I could\nwell imagine that it had strength sufficient to perform many, at least,\nif not all of the wonderful feats ascribed to it by the natives.\n\nShortly after the death of the gorilla, night settled down upon the\nscene, so we hurried back towards our camp, where we arrived much\nexhausted, yet greatly elated, by our successful day's sport.\n\nI spent a great part of that night making entries in my note-book, by\nthe light of our camp-fires, while my companions slept.  And, truly, I\nenjoyed such quiet hours after days of so great mental and physical\nexcitement.  I observed, also, that the negroes enjoyed those seasons\nexceedingly.  They sat round the blaze, talking and laughing, and\nrecounting, I have no doubt, their feats of daring by flood and field;\nthen, when they began to grow sleepy, they sat there swaying to and fro,\nmaking an occasional remark, until they became too sleepy even for that,\nwhen they began to nod and wink and start, and almost fell into the\nfire, so unwilling did they seem to tear themselves away from it, even\nfor the distance of the few feet they required to draw back in order to\nenable them to lie down.  At last nature could hold out no longer, and\none by one they dropped back in their places.\n\nI, too, began to nod at last, and to make entries in my note-book which\nwere too disjointed at last to be comprehensible; so I finally resigned\nmyself to repose, and to dream, as a matter of course.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\n\nOUR PLANS ARE SUDDENLY ALTERED--WICKED DESIGNS DISCOVERED.\n\nFor several weeks after this we wandered about in the woods searching\nfor gorillas.  We were very successful, and shot so many that I had the\nsatisfaction of making elaborate notes of specimens of nearly all ages\nand kinds.\n\nBut an event was looming in the future which we little thought of, and\nwhich ultimately compelled us to abandon the gorilla country and retrace\nour steps towards the southern part of the continent.\n\nOne day we set out, as was our wont, to hunt for gorillas, accompanied\nonly by our faithful follower Makarooroo.  It chanced to be a lovely\nday, and the country through which we were passing was exceedingly\nbeautiful, so that we found more pleasure at that time in conversing\ntogether on the beauties of nature and on the wonderful works of\nnature's God than in contemplating our chances of falling in with game.\n\n\"It's a splendid country,\" said Jack, as we walked along under the shade\nof some magnificent ebony trees.  \"I wish that it were inhabited by a\nChristian people.  Perhaps this may be the case one of these days, but I\ndon't think we shall live to see it.\"\n\n\"There's no saying, Jack,\" observed Peterkin.  \"Does not the Bible speak\nof a `nation being born in a day?'  Of course that must be figurative\nlanguage; nevertheless it must mean something, and I incline to think\nthat it means that there shall be a time when men shall flock rapidly,\nand in unusually great numbers, to the Saviour.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" observed I, \"but I have made up my mind on this point,\nthat Christian people are not sufficiently awake to the terrible\ncondition of the natives of countries such as this, or to the fact that\nthey have much in their power to do for the amelioration of both their\ntemporal and spiritual welfare.  I, for one, will, if spared to return\nhome, contribute more largely than I have been wont to do to the cause\nof missions.\"\n\n\"Talking of that,\" said Peterkin, \"do you think it right to support the\nmissions of other churches besides your own?\"\n\n\"Do I think it right?\"  I exclaimed in surprise.  \"Of course I do.  I\nthink it one of the greatest evils that can befall a Christian, that he\nshould become so narrow-minded as to give only to his own church, and\nthink _only_ of his own church's missions.  Why, surely a soul saved, if\na matter of rejoicing in heaven, ought to be a matter of joy on earth,\nwithout reference to the particular church which was the instrument used\nby the Holy Spirit for that end.  I feel very strongly that all\nChristians who love our Saviour with deep sincerity must of necessity\nhave a warm feeling towards His people in _all_ churches.  At any rate\nwe ought to cultivate such a feeling.\"\n\n\"Who can these be?\" cried Jack, stopping and pointing to some figures\nthat appeared to be approaching us in the distance.\n\n\"They are negroes, at any rate,\" said I; \"for they seem to be black, and\nare evidently naked.\"\n\n\"Warriors, too, if I mistake not.  They have not yet observed us.  Shall\nwe hide and let them pass?\"\n\nJack hesitated a moment, then leaping behind a bush, cried--\n\n\"Ay, 'tis well to be cautious when nothing is to be gained by daring.\nThese fellows outnumber us, and war-parties are not to be trusted--at\nleast not if these of Africa resemble those of North America.\"\n\n\"Hollo! there's a white man with them,\" cried Peterkin, as he peeped\nover the bushes behind which we were hid.\n\n\"You don't say so, eh?  So there is.  Come; we have nothing to fear from\nthe party of a traveller.--What, Mak, you shake your head!  What mean\nyou?\"\n\nMakarooroo increased the shaking of his head, and said, \"Me no know\n_dat_, massa.  P'raps hab more to fear dan you tink.\"\n\n\"Oh, stuff! come along.  Why, Mak, it seems as if gorilla-hunting had\nfailed to improve your courage.\"\n\nAs Jack said this he stepped out from among the bushes and advanced to\nmeet the strangers.  Of course we all followed, and although we carried\nour rifles in a careless manner, as if we expected no evil, yet we held\nourselves in readiness to take instant action if necessary.\n\nThe moment the negroes perceived us, they set up a great shout and\nbrandished their spears and guns, but the voice of their leader was\ninstantly heard commanding them to halt.  They obeyed at once, and the\nEuropean stranger advanced alone to meet us.  As he drew near we\nobserved that he was a splendid-looking man, nearly as large as Jack\nhimself, with a handsome figure and a free, off-hand gait.  But on\ncoming closer we saw that his countenance, though handsome, wore a\nforbidding, stern expression.\n\n\"Dat am a slabe-dealer,\" whispered our guide, as the stranger came up\nand saluted us in French.\n\nJack replied in the same language; but on learning that we were\nEnglishmen, he began to talk in our own tongue, although he evidently\nunderstood very little of it.\n\n\"Do you travel alone with the natives?\" inquired Jack, after a few\npreliminary remarks.\n\n\"Yaas, sair, I doos,\" replied the stranger, who was a Portuguese trader,\naccording to his own account.\n\n\"You seem to carry little or no merchandise with you,\" said Jack,\nglancing towards the party of natives, who stood at some distance\nlooking at us and conversing together eagerly.\n\n\"I has none wis me, true, bot I has moche not ver' far off.  I bees go\njust now to seek for ivory, and ebony, and sl-a---w'at you call him?\nbarwood.\"\n\nThe man corrected himself quickly, but the slip confirmed Makarooroo's\nremark and our own suspicions that he was a slave-dealer.\n\n\"De day is far gone,\" he continued, putting as amiable a smile on his\ncountenance as possible; \"perhaps you vill stop and we have dine\ntogedder.\"\n\nAlthough we did not much like the appearance of our new friend or his\nparty, we felt that it would be uncourteous in so wild a country, where\nwe had so few chances of meeting with white faces, to refuse, so we\nagreed.  A camp-fire was speedily kindled, and the two parties mingled\ntogether, and sat down amicably to discuss roast monkey and venison\nsteaks together.\n\nDuring the course of the meal the Portuguese trader became so\ncommunicative and agreeable that we all began to think we had judged him\nharshly.  We observed, too, that Makarooroo and the negroes had\nfraternised heartily, and our guide was singing and laughing, and making\nhimself agreeable at a very uncommon rate, so much so as to call forth\nour surprise.\n\n\"Mak seems to be mad to-day,\" observed Peterkin, as one of our guide's\njovial laughs rang through the wood and was echoed by his new\nacquaintances.\n\n\"Bees him not always so?\" inquired the Portuguese.\n\n\"He's always hearty enough,\" replied Jack, \"but I must confess I never\nsaw him in such high spirits as he seems to be in just now.  It must be\nthe effect of meeting with new faces, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Ah! s'pose so,\" remarked the trader.\n\nI was struck with the manner in which this was said.  There was a tone\nof affected indifference, such as one assumes when making a passing\nremark, but at the same time a dark frown rested for one moment on his\nbrow, and he cast a piercing vindictive glance at our guide.  Next\nmoment he was smiling blandly and making some humorous remark to\nPeterkin.\n\nI looked at my companions, but they had evidently not observed this\nlittle piece of by-play.  It seemed to me so unaccountable, considering\nthat the two men had never met before, that I resolved to watch them.  I\nsoon observed that Makarooroo's mirth was forced, that he was in fact\nacting a part, and I noticed once or twice that he also cast an\noccasional stealthy and piercing glance at the Portuguese.  It\nafterwards turned out that both men had been acting the same part, and\nthat each had suspected what the other was doing.\n\nWhen our meal was concluded we prepared to resume our separate routes.\n\n\"I goes to de west,\" observed the Portuguese, in a casual way, as he\nbuckled on the belt that supported his hunting-knife.\n\n\"Indeed!  I had understood you to say that you were going south.\"\n\n\"No; you not have onderstand me.  I goes to de west, ver' long way.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I wish you a safe and pleasant journey,\" said Jack, lifting\nhis cap.\n\n\"De same to you, sairs, an' goot plenty of gorillas to you.  Farder nord\ndey be more plenty.  Adieu!\"\n\nWe took off our caps to each other, and saying farewell, we turned away,\nand soon lost sight of the party.\n\n\"Ho! de yaller-faced villain,\" exclaimed Makarooroo between his clinched\nteeth, after we were out of earshot.\n\n\"Why, what's wrong, Mak?\" inquired Peterkin, in great surprise.\n\n\"Ho! noting porteekler,\" replied the guide, with an air and tone of\nsarcasm that quite amused us.  \"Hims not go sout', ho no! hims go west,\nho yis!  Hims advise us to go nort', ho dear! dat bery clibber, bery\nmush clibber; but we is clibberer, we is, ho! ho! ho!\"\n\nOur worthy guide looked so terribly fierce as he uttered this fiendish\nlaugh, that we all came to a stand and gazed at him in surprise; we\nfancied that something must have deranged his mind.\n\n\"Mak,\" said Peterkin, \"you are mad.  What mean you by such grimaces?\"\n\nPursing his lips tightly, and looking at each of us for a few moments in\nsilence, he finally crossed his arms on his chest, and turning eagerly\nto Jack, said with extreme volubility--\n\n\"Dat rascal! dat tief!  Him's no trader, him's slabe-dealer; hims no go\nwest, hims go south; an' w'at for hims go?  W'at for hims carry guns so\nmany, eh?  Hims go\" (here the guide dropped his voice into a whisper of\nintense bitterness)--\"hims go for attack village an' take all peepils\naway for be slabes.  No pay for 'em--tief!--take dem by force.\"\n\n\"Why, how did you come to know all this,\" said Jack, \"or rather to\nsuspect it? for you cannot be sure that you are right.\"\n\n\"W'at, no can be sure me right? ho, yis, me sartin sure.  Me bery\nclibber.  Stop, now.  Did him--dat tief!--speak bery mush?\"\n\n\"Certainly he did, a good deal.\"\n\n\"Yis, ho!  An' did him make _you_ speak bery mush?\"\n\n\"I rather think he did,\" replied Peterkin, laughing at our guide's\neagerness.\n\n\"Yis, ho! hims did.  An' did him ax you plenty question, all 'bout where\nyou go, an' where you come from, an' _de way back_ to village where we\nbe come from?  An' did hims say, when him find you was come from _sout_,\ndat hims was go _west_, though before dat hims hab say dat hims be go\n_sout_, eh?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Jack, with a thoughtful look, \"he did say all that,\nand a great deal more to that effect.\"\n\n\"Yis, ho! hims did.  Me know bery well.  Me see him.  An' me also dood\nto de niggers what hims do to you.  Me talk an' laugh an' sing, _den me\nax dem questions_.  But dey bery wise; dey no speak mush, but dey manage\nto speak 'nuff for me.  Yis, me bam--bam--eh?\"\n\n\"Boozle,\" suggested Peterkin.\n\n\"Vis, bamboozle dem altogidder, ho! ho!\"\n\nAfter a little further explanation we found that this Portuguese trader\nwas a man-stealer, on his way to one of the smaller villages, with the\nintention of attacking it.  Makarooroo ascertained that they meant to\nproceed direct to that of King Jambai, first, however, getting one of\nthe neighbouring tribes to pick a quarrel with that monarch and go to\nwar with him; and we now recollected, with deep regret, that in our\nignorance of what the Portuguese was, we had given him a great deal of\ninformation regarding the village of our late hospitable entertainer\nwhich might prove very useful to him, and very hurtful to poor King\nJambai, in the event of such a raid being carried out.\n\nBut, in addition to this, Makarooroo had ascertained that it was\npossible that, before going to King Jambai's village, they might perhaps\nmake a descent on that of our friend Mbango, with whom we had left poor\nOkandaga.  It was this that raised the wrath of our guide to such a\npitch.\n\nThe instant we heard it Jack said--\n\n\"Then that settles the question of our future proceedings.  We must bid\nadieu to the gorillas at once, and dog the steps of this marauding\nparty, so as to prevent our good friends Mbango and Jambai being\nsurprised and carried into slavery along with all their people.  It\nseems to me that our path is clear in this matter.  Even if we were not\nbound in honour to succour those who have treated us hospitably, we\nought to do our best to undo the evil we have done in telling their\nenemies so much about them.  Besides, we must save Okandaga, whatever\nhappens.  What say you, comrades?\"\n\n\"Of course we must,\" said Peterkin.  I also heartily concurred.\n\n\"You's a good man,\" said Makarooroo, his eyes glistening with emotion.\n\n\"If I did not stand by you at such a time as this,\" replied Jack,\nsmiling, \"I should certainly be a very bad man.\"\n\n\"But what are we to do about our goods?\" inquired I, \"We cannot hope to\nkeep up with these robbers if we carry our goods with us; and yet it\nseems hard to leave them behind, for we should fare ill, I fear, in this\ncountry if we travel as beggars.\"\n\n\"We shall easily manage as to that,\" replied Jack.  \"I have observed\nthat one of our niggers is a sensible, and, I am disposed to think, a\ntrustworthy fellow--\"\n\n\"D'you mean the man with the blind eye and the thumping big nose?\"\ninquired Peterkin.\n\n\"The same.  Well, I shall put him in charge, and tell him to follow us\nto Mbango's village; then we four shall start off light, and hunt our\nway south, travelling as fast as we can, and carrying as many strings of\nbeads, by way of small change, as we can stuff into our pockets and\nfasten about our persons.\"\n\n\"The very thing,\" cried Peterkin.  \"So let's put it in practice at\nonce.\"\n\n\"Ay, this very night,\" said Jack, as we hurried back to the spot where\nour goods had been left.\n\nAs we went along in silence I noticed that Peterkin sighed once or twice\nvery heavily, and I asked him if he was quite well.\n\n\"Well?  Ay, well enough in body, Ralph, but ill at ease in mind.  How\ncan it be otherwise when we are thus suddenly and unexpectedly about to\ntake leave of our dear friends the gorillas?  I declare my heart is fit\nto break.\"\n\n\"I sympathise with you, Peterkin,\" said I, \"for I have not yet made\nnearly as many notes in regard to these monster-monkeys as I could have\nwished.  However, I am thankful for what I have got, and perhaps we may\ncome back here again one of these days.\"\n\n\"What bloodthirsty fellows!\" cried Jack, laughing.  \"If you talk so, I\nfear that Mak and I shall have to cut your acquaintance; for, you see,\nhe and I have got a _little_ feeling left.\"\n\n\"Well, it's natural, I fancy,\" observed Peterkin, \"that gorillas should\nfeel for their kindred.  However, I console myself with the thought that\nthe country farther south is much better filled with other game,\nalthough the great puggy is not there.  And then we shall come among\nlions again, which we can never find, I believe, in the gorilla country.\nI wonder if the gorilla has really driven them out of this part of\nAfrica.\"\n\n\"Some think it probable,\" observed I, \"but we cannot make sure of that\npoint.\"\n\n\"Well, we can at all events make sure of this point,\" cried Peterkin, as\nwe came in sight of our encampment, \"that lions are thick enough in the\ncountry whither we are bound; so let's have a good supper, and hurrah\nfor the south!  It's a bright prospect before us.  A fair lady to be\nsaved; possibly a fight with the niggers, and lion, elephant,\nrhinoceros, alligator, hippopotamus, and buffalo shooting by way of\nrelaxation in the intervals of the war!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\n\nAN UNEXPECTED MEETING--WE FLY, AND I MAKE A NARROW ESCAPE FROM AN\nAPPALLING FATE.\n\nDuring many days after the incidents narrated in the last chapter did\nJack, and Peterkin, and Makarooroo, and I, push across the continent\nthrough bush and brake, over hill and dale, morass and plain, at our\nutmost possible speed.  We did not, during the whole course of our\njourney, overtake the Portuguese slave-dealer; but we thought little of\nthat, for it was not very probable that we should hit upon exactly the\nsame route, and we entertained sanguine hopes that the energy and speed\nwith which we kept steadily and undeviatingly on our way would enable us\nto reach the village of Mbango before the slave-dealer and his party.\n\nWhen I look back upon that time now, and reflect calmly on the dangers\nwe encountered and the hardships we endured, I confess that I am filled\nwith amazement.  I might easily fill several volumes such as this with\nanecdotes of our encounters with wild animals, and other adventures; but\nhowever interesting these might be in themselves, I must not forget that\nsome of the main incidents of our sojourn in Africa have yet to be\nrelated, and that there is a limit to the patience of even youthful\nreaders.\n\nOur power of enduring fatigue and sustained active exertion, with\ncomparatively short intervals of nightly repose, was much greater than I\ncould have believed to be possible.  I have no doubt that anxiety to\nsave Okandaga from the terrible fate that hung over her enabled us to\nbear up under fatigues which would at other times have overcome us.  I\nknow not well how it was that I kept up with my strong and agile\ncomrades.  Oftentimes I felt ready to drop down as I walked, yet somehow\nI never thought of falling behind, but went doggedly on, and at nights\nfound myself little worse in condition than they.  Peterkin, although\nsmall, was tough and springy, and his spirits seemed rather to rise than\notherwise as his strength abated.  As for Jack, I never saw any one like\nhim.  He seemed like a lion roaming in his strength over his native\ndeserts.  So hardened had we all become during the course of our travels\nthat we found ourselves not only equal to Makarooroo in pedestrian\npowers, but superior; for when occasion required we could almost knock\nhim up, but I am free to admit that we never succeeded in doing this\nthoroughly.  In short, we were all as nearly as possible equal to each\nother, with the exception of Jack, who seemed in every way invulnerable.\n\nDuring this long and hurried but intensely interesting and delightful\njourney we came upon, at different times, almost every species of\nanimal, plant, and tree peculiar to the African continent.  Oftentimes\nwe passed by droves and herds of elephants, deer, buffalo, giraffes,\nantelopes, and zebras; we saw rhinoceroses, alligators, leopards, lions,\napes of several kinds, and smaller monkeys innumerable.  We also saw\ngreat numbers of birds--some curious on account of their habits and\nform, others beautiful and bright as the rainbow.\n\nYet although, as I have said, this journey was very delightful, our\nfeelings were at different times exceedingly varied, and not\nunfrequently pained; for while we saw around us much that was beautiful,\ninnocent, and lovely, we also witnessed the conflicts of many wild\ncreatures, and sometimes came across evidences of the savage and cruel\ndispositions of the human beings by whom the country was peopled.  We\nalways, however, carefully avoided native villages, being anxious not to\nbe interrupted on our forced march.  Neither did we turn aside to hunt,\nalthough we were much tempted so to do, but contented ourselves with\nkilling such animals as we required for our daily subsistence; and of\nthese we shot as many as we required without having to turn aside from\nour straight course.\n\nThus we went on day after day, and slept under the shade of the trees or\nunder the wide canopy of heaven night after night, until we arrived one\nday at a beautiful valley, bordered by a plain, and traversed by a\nriver, where Peterkin met with a sad accident, and our onward progress\nwas for a short period arrested.\n\nIt happened thus:--The region through which we chanced to be passing was\npeopled by so many natives that we had the utmost difficulty in avoiding\nthem, and more than once were compelled to halt during the daytime in\nsome sequestered dell, and resume our journey during the night.\n\nOne day--it was, if I remember rightly, about two o'clock in the\nafternoon--we came suddenly in sight of a native village on the banks of\nthe river whose course we were at that time following, and made a wide\ndetour in order to avoid it.  We had passed it several miles, and were\ngradually bending into our course again, when we came unexpectedly upon\na band of natives who had been out hunting and were returning to their\nvillage with the spoils of the chase on their shoulders.  Both parties\nat once came to an abrupt halt, and we stood for several minutes looking\nat each other--the natives in speechless amazement, while we conversed\nin whispers, uncertain what to do.\n\nWe knew that if we made friendly advances we should no doubt be\nwelcomed, but then we should certainly be compelled to go back with them\nto their village and spend at least a day or two with them, as we could\nnot hope to give them a satisfactory reason for our going on at once.\nWe also knew that to go on in spite of them would produce a quarrel,\nand, of course, a fight, which, as it would certainly result in\nbloodshed, was by all means to be avoided for we could not bear to think\nthat a mere caprice of ours in visiting Africa should be the means of\ncausing the death of a single human being, if we could prevent it.\n\n\"What _is_ to be done?\" said Peterkin, looking at Jack in despair.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jack.  \"It's very awkward.  It will never do to\ngo all the way back to the village with these stupid fellows, and we\ncannot tell them our real reason for going on; for, in the first place,\nthey would perhaps not believe us, or, in the second place, they might\noffer to join us.\"\n\n\"Fight,\" said Makarooroo in a low tone, grinding his teeth together and\nclutching his rifle.\n\nI felt deep sympathy with the poor fellow, for I knew well that in\ndisposition he was naturally the reverse of quarrelsome, and that his\npresent state of mind was the consequence of anxiety for the deliverance\nof his faithful bride.\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Jack quickly; \"we shall not fight.\"\n\n\"Suppose we bolt!\" whispered Peterkin, brightening up as the idea\noccurred to him--\"regularly run away!\"\n\nWe seized at the idea instantly.  We were all of us hard of muscle and\nstrong of wind now, and we knew that we could outstrip the savages.\n\n\"We'll do it!\" said Jack hastily.  \"Let us scatter, too, so as to\nperplex them at the outset.\"\n\n\"Capital!  Then here goes.  I'm off,\" cried Peterkin.\n\n\"Stay!\" said Jack.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Peterkin.\n\n\"Because we must appoint a place of rendezvous if we would hope to meet\nagain.\"\n\n\"True; I forgot that.\"\n\n\"D'you all see yonder blue mountain-peak?\"\n\n\"Let us meet there.  If we miss each other at the base, let us proceed\nto the summit and wait.  Away!\"\n\nAs Jack uttered the last word we all turned right about and fled like\nthe wind.  The savages instantly set up a hideous yell, and darted after\nus; but we made for the thick woods, and scattering in all directions,\nas had been previously arranged, speedily threw them off the scent, and\nfinally made our escape.\n\nFor the first time since landing on the continent of Africa, I now found\nmyself totally alone in the wild forest.  After separating from my\ncompanions, I ran at my utmost speed in the direction of a dense jungle,\nwhere I purposed taking shelter until the natives should pass by, and\nthen come out and pursue my way leisurely.  But I was prevented from\nadopting this course in consequence of two very fleet negroes\ndiscovering my intention, and, by taking a short cut, frustrating it.  I\nwas compelled, therefore, to keep in the more open part of the forest,\nand trust simply to speed and endurance for escape.\n\nI should think that I ran nearly two miles at full speed, and kept well\nahead of my pursuers.  Indeed, I had distanced them considerably; but\nfeeling that I could not hold out long at such a killing pace, I pulled\nup a little, and allowed them to gain on me slightly.  I was just about\nto resume my full speed, and, if possible, throw them at once far\nbehind, when my foot was caught by a thorny shrub, and I fell headlong\nto the ground.  I was completely stunned for a moment or two, and lay\nquite motionless.  But my consciousness suddenly returned, accompanied\nby a feeling of imminent danger, which caused me to spring up and renew\nmy headlong career.  Glancing over my shoulder, I saw that the two\nnatives had gained so much on me that had I lain a few seconds longer I\nmust inevitably have been captured.\n\nI exerted myself now beyond my powers.  My head, too, from the shock I\nhad received, became confused, and I scarce knew whither I was going.\nPresently a loud, dull roar, as if of distant thunder, struck upon my\near, and I beheld what appeared to me to be a vast white plain covered\nwith mist before.  Next moment I found myself on the brink of a\nprecipice of a hundred feet deep, over which, a little to my left, a\nlarge river fell, and thundered down into a dark abyss, whence issued\nthose clouds of spray which I had taken for a white plain in the\nconfusion of my brain and vision.\n\nI made a desperate effort to check myself, but it was too late.  My\nheels broke off the earthy edge of the cliff, and I obtained just one\nawful glance of the horrid turmoil directly below me as I fell over with\na mass of debris.  I uttered an involuntary shriek of agony, and flung\nmy arms wildly out.  My hand clutched the branch of an overhanging bush.\nThis, slight though it was, was the means, under God, of saving my\nlife.  The branch broke off, but it checked my fall, and at the same\ntime swung me into the centre of a tree which projected out from the\ncliff almost horizontally.  Through this tree I went crashing with\nfearful violence, until I was arrested by my chest striking against a\nstout branch.  This I clutched with the tenacity of despair, and\nwriggling myself, as it were, along it, wound my arms and legs round it,\nand held on for some time with the utmost fervour of muscular energy.\n\nMy position now was beyond conception horrible.  I shut my eyes and\nprayed earnestly for help.  Presently I opened them, and in the position\nin which I then lay, the first thing I saw was the boiling water of the\nfall more than a hundred feet below me.  My agony was such that large\ndrops of perspiration broke out all over my forehead.  It was many\nminutes before I could summon up courage to turn my head so as to look\nupward, for I had a vague feeling that if I were to move the branch on\nwhich I lay would break off.  When I did so, I observed that the\nbranches over my head completely screened the sky from me, so that I\nknew I had escaped one danger; for the natives, believing, no doubt,\nthat I had fallen down into the river, would at once give up their\nhopeless pursuit.  The branch on which I lay was so slender that it\nswayed about with every motion that I made, and the longer I remained\nthere the more nervous did I become.\n\nAt last I bethought me that unless I made a manful effort I should\ncertainly perish, so I looked about me until I became accustomed to the\ngiddy position.  Then I perceived that, by creeping along the branch\nuntil I gained the trunk of the tree, I could descend by means of it to\nthe face of the precipice from which it projected, and thus gain a\nnarrow ledge of rock that overhung the abyss.  In any other\ncircumstances I would as soon have ventured to cross the Falls of\nNiagara on a tight-rope; but I had no other alternative, so I crept\nalong the branch slowly and nervously, clinging to it, at the same time,\nwith terrible tenacity.  At last I gained the trunk of the tree and\nbreathed more freely, for it was much steadier than the branch.\n\nThe trunk projected, as I have said, almost horizontally from the\nprecipice, so I had to draw myself carefully along it, not daring to get\non my hands and knees, and finally reached the ledge above referred to.\nCompared with my former position, this was a place of temporary safety,\nfor it was three feet wide, and having a good head, I had no fear of\nfalling over.  But on looking up my heart sank within me, for the bare\ncliff offered no foothold whatever.  I do not believe that a monkey\ncould have climbed it.  To descend the precipice was equally impossible,\nfor it was like a wall.  My only hope, therefore, lay in the ledge on\nwhich I stood, and which, I observed, ran along to the right and turned\nround a projecting rock that hid the remainder of it from view.\n\nHasting along it, I found, to my inexpressible relief, that it\ncommunicated with the top of the precipice.  The ascent was difficult\nand dangerous; but at last I succeeded in passing the most serious part,\nand soon gained the summit of the cliff in safety, where I immediately\nfell on my knees and returned thanks for my deliverance.\n\nI had passed nearly an hour in the trying adventure which I have just\nrelated, and feeling that my companions would naturally begin soon to be\nanxious about me, I started for our rendezvous, which I reached in\nlittle more than an hour and a half.  Here I found Jack seated alone\nbeside a stream of water, from which he occasionally lifted a little in\nthe hollow of his hand and drank greedily.\n\n\"Ah, Ralph, my boy!\" he exclaimed joyfully as I came up, \"I'm glad\nyou've come.  I had begun to fear that you must have been captured.  Ay,\ndrink, lad!  You seem warm enough, though I scarcely think you can be\nmuch more so than I am.  What a run we have had, to be sure!  But, what,\nRalph--your clothes are much torn, and your face and hands are\nscratched.  Why, you must have got among thorns.  Not badly hurt, I\ntrust?\"\n\n\"Oh no; nothing to speak of.  I have, however, had a narrow escape.  But\nbefore I speak of that, what of Peterkin?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jack, with an anxious expression; \"and to say\ntruth, I begin to feel uneasy about him, for he ought to have been here\nalmost as soon as myself.\"\n\n\"How so?  Did you, then, run together?\"\n\n\"Latterly we did.  At first we separated, and I knew not what had become\neither of him or you.  The fact is, I had enough to do to look out for\nmyself, for a dozen of rascally niggers kept close upon my heels and\ntried my powers of running somewhat; so I took to the thick wood and\nmade a detour, to throw them off the scent.  All at once I heard a\nsmashing of the bushes right in front of me, and before I knew what I\nwas about, Peterkin bounced through the underwood and almost plunged\ninto my arms.  We both gave an involuntary yell of alarm.\n\n\"`There's two of 'em right on my heels,' said he in a gasp, as he dashed\noff again.  `Come along with me, Jack.'\n\n\"I followed as fast as I could, and we crossed an open plain together,\nwhen I looked over my shoulder, and saw that all the other fellows had\ngiven up the chase except the two mentioned by Peterkin.  These kept on\nafter us, and somehow or other we got separated again, just after\nre-entering the wood on the other side of the plain.  Of course I ran\non, expecting to see my companion every minute.  Finally I came to the\nrendezvous, and here I found that the savages had given up all hope of\novertaking me, for I could see nothing of them.\"\n\n\"How long ago is that?\"  I inquired quickly.\n\n\"About an hour.\"\n\n\"Then poor Peterkin must have been caught,\" said I, in a voice of\ndespair.\n\n\"No, that is not likely,\" replied Jack; \"for I climbed a high tree and\nsaw the savages recrossing the plain alone.  I think it probable he may\nhave lost his way, and is afraid to climb trees or to fire off his gun\nto signal us, for fear of being heard or seen by the niggers.  I have\nsent Mak, who came here soon after I did, to search for him.\"\n\n\"It may be as you say, Jack, but we must go at once to look for him.\"\n\n\"With all my heart, Ralph.  I only waited until you had sufficiently\nrested.\"\n\n\"The body cannot rest when the mind is ill at ease.  Come, let us start\nat once.  I shall tell you of my little adventure as we go along.\"\n\nWe soon reached the edge of the plain where Jack had been separated from\nhis companion, and here we proceeded to make a careful search.  Being\ncertain that the savages were now out of earshot, we began to halloo\noccasionally as we went along.  But monkeys and parrots alone replied to\nus.\n\n\"This is the very spot where I last saw him,\" said Jack, leading me to a\npalm-tree which stood a little within the outer verge of the wood; \"and\nhere are his footsteps faintly indicated on the grass.\"\n\n\"Ah! then let us follow these up,\" said I eagerly.\n\n\"We might, if we were North American backwoodsmen or Red Indians; but I\ncan scarcely follow.  Stay, here they enter upon a piece of soft ground,\nand are more distinct.  Now, then, we shall get on.\"\n\nFor nearly quarter of an hour we followed the footprints; then we came\nto dry ground again, and lost all traces of them.  We wandered about\nperseveringly, nevertheless, and were rewarded by again discovering them\nabout quarter of a mile farther on, leading down to the banks of the\nriver on another part of which I had had such a narrow escape.\n\nWhile we were advancing--I in front--I felt the ground beneath me\nsuddenly begin to give way with a crackling sound.  I instinctively\nthrew up my arms and sprang back.\n\n\"Hollo, Ralph!\" cried my companion, seizing me with one hand by the\ncollar, and hauling, or rather lifting me back, as if I had been a\npoodle dog.  \"Why, you were as near as possible into a pitfall.\"\n\n\"Thanks to you, Jack, that I am not actually in,\" said I, putting my\nsomewhat twisted costume to rights.  \"But, I say, does it not strike you\nthat perhaps Peterkin has fallen into one of these?\"\n\nWe both started and listened with breathless attention, for at that\nmoment we heard a faint groan not far from us.  It was repeated almost\nimmediately, though so faintly that we could scarcely ascertain the\ndirection whence it came.  We advanced cautiously, however, a few paces,\nand discovered a hole in the ground, from which, at that very moment,\nthe dishevelled head of poor Peterkin appeared, like Jack coming out of\nhis box.  His sudden appearance and serio-comic expression would have\nbeen at any other time sufficient to have set us off in fits of\nlaughter; but joy at finding him, and anxiety lest he should prove to be\nseriously hurt, restrained us at that time effectually.\n\n\"My dear fellow!\" cried Jack, hurrying forward.\n\n\"Keep back! avaunt ye.  Oh dear me, Jack, my poor head!\" said Peterkin\nwith a sigh, pressing his hand to his forehead; \"what an intolerable\nwhack I have got on my miserable caput.  There; don't come nearer, else\nyou'll break through.  Reach me your hand.  That's it; thank'ee.\"\n\n\"There you are, all safe, my boy,\" cried Jack, as he drew Peterkin out\nof the hole.--\"But hollo!  I say, Ralph, run down for some water; I\nbelieve the poor fellow has fainted.\"\n\nI sprang down the river-bank, and speedily returned with some water in\nthe crown of my wide-awake.  Peterkin had recovered before I came back,\nand a long draught quite restored him, so that in a few minutes he was\nable to relate how the accident had befallen him.\n\n\"You see,\" said he, in a jocular tone, for it was a most unusually\nsevere accident indeed that could drive the fun out of our little\nfriend--\"you see, after I lost sight of Jack, I took a leaf out of the\nhare's book, and doubled on my course.  This brought me, unhappily, to\nthe banks of the river, where I came upon one of the pitfalls that are\nmade by the niggers here to catch wild beasts, and in I went.  I kept\nhold of the surface boughs, however, scrambled out again, and pushed on.\nBut I had not gone ten yards when the ground began to crackle and sink.\nI made a desperate bound to clear it, but my foot caught in a branch,\nand down I went head foremost into the pit.  And that's the whole of my\nstory.  How long I remained there I know not.  If I had known what time\nit was when I dived in, and you were to tell me what o'clock it is now,\nwe might arrive at a knowledge of the time I have spent at the bottom of\nthat hole.  All that I can positively affirm is, that I went in, and\nwithin in the last ten minutes I came out!\"\n\nWe laughed at this free-and-easy manner of narrating the incident, and\nthen prepared to return to our rendezvous; but on attempting to walk,\nPeterkin found that he had received a greater shake than at first he had\nimagined.  Several times during our march he became giddy, and had to be\nsupported; and after reaching our encampment, where we found Makarooroo\nwaiting for us, he fainted.  We were therefore obliged to make up our\nminds to encamp where we were for a few days.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\n\nAN UNFORTUNATE DELAY, AND A TERRIBLE VISITOR.\n\nOnly those who have been forcibly held back when filled with the deepest\nanxiety to go forward, can form any thing like a conception of our state\nof mind during the few days that succeeded that on which Peterkin met\nwith his accident.\n\nWe felt like chained hounds when the huntsmen pass by.  We knew that\nevery hour increased the distance between us and the slave-dealer's\nparty, who, unless we succeeded in passing them and reaching the\nvillages first, would infallibly succeed in their villainous design.\nBut Peterkin was unable to proceed without great risk, as whenever he\nattempted to walk steadily for any distance his head became giddy, and\nwe were compelled to halt, so that a day or two's rest was absolutely\nnecessary.  Poor Makarooroo was nearly beside himself with impatience;\nbut to do him justice, he endeavoured to conceal the state of his\nfeelings when in Peterkin's presence.\n\nDuring this period of forced inaction, although of course I had nothing\nto do, I found it impossible to apply my mind closely to the study of\nany of the strange and beautiful objects by which I was surrounded.\nAnxiety banished from me almost entirely the love of study, as well as\nthe power of observation.  Nevertheless, one or two things that I saw\nwere so curious that they could not but make a deep impression on my\nmemory.\n\nI discovered a spider of a very remarkable kind, which was such an\ningenious creature as to be capable of making a door to the entrance of\nits house.  I came upon the animal one day while taking a stroll a short\ndistance from our camp.  It was as large as a shilling, reddish in\ncolour, and from the fierce, rapid way in which it ran about hither and\nthither as if in search of prey, it had an exceedingly horrible and\nvoracious aspect.  The hole of this creature is visible only when its\nowner is absent from home.  It is quite evident either that there are no\nthieves among the lower animals there, or that there is nothing in the\nhole to steal, for when he goes out he leaves the door open behind him.\nWhen he returns he shuts the door, and the hole becomes invisible, in\nconsequence of the door being coated with earth on the outside.  Its\ninside is lined with a pure white silky substance, which at once\nattracted my attention as I passed.  On trying to pick up the door, I\nfound that it was attached by a hinge to the hole, and on being shut it\nfitted exactly.\n\nPerhaps the most singular discovery I made was a tree, the stem of which\nhad been so completely surrounded by spiders' webs that it could not be\nseen, and I had to cut through the network with my knife in order to get\nat the tree.  The lines of those webs were as thick as coarse threads,\nand pretty strong, as I had reason to know; for when walking back to\ncamp the same evening, meditating deeply on our unfortunate detention, I\nran my head into the middle of a spider's web, and was completely\nenveloped in it, so much so that it was with considerable difficulty I\nsucceeded in clearing it away.  I was as regularly netted as if a gauze\nveil had been thrown over me.\n\nOn our third morning after the accident we set forth again, and\ncontinued our journey by forced marches as Peterkin could bear it.\nAlthough the two past days and nights had been absolutely lost, and\ncould not now be recalled, yet the moment we set out and left our camp\nbehind us, the load of anxiety was at once lifted off our minds, and we\nhurried forward with an elasticity of step and spirit that was quite\ndelightful.  We felt like prisoners set free, and kept up a continual\nflow of conversation, sometimes in reference to the scenery and objects\naround us, at other times in regard to our future plans or our past\nexperiences.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Jack, breaking silence at the end of a long pause\nwhich had succeeded an animated discussion as to whether it were better\nto spend one's life in the civilised world or among the wilds of Africa,\nin which discussion Peterkin, who advocated the wild life, was utterly,\nthough not admittedly, beaten--\"it seems to me that, notwithstanding the\nshort time we stayed in the gorilla country, we have been pretty\nsuccessful.  Haven't we bagged thirty-three altogether?\"\n\n\"Thirty-six, if you count the babies in arms,\" responded Peterkin.\n\n\"Of course we are entitled to count these.\"\n\n\"I think you are both out in your reckoning,\" said I, drawing out my\nnote-book; \"the last baby that I shot was our thirty-seventh.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Peterkin, \"the one with the desperately black face and the\nhorrible squint, that nearly tore all the hair out of Jack's head before\nhe managed to strangle him?  That wasn't a baby; it was a big boy, and I\nhave no doubt a big rascal besides.\"\n\n\"That may be so,\" I rejoined; \"but whatever he was, I have him down as\nnumber thirty-seven in my list.\"\n\n\"Pity we didn't make up the forty,\" observed Jack.\n\n\"Ah! yes indeed,\" said Peterkin.  \"But let me see: could we not manage\nto make it up to that yet?\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said I.  \"We are far away from the gorilla land now, I\nknow; for, in addition to the fact that we have seen no traces of\ngorillas for a long time, we have, within the last few days, seen\nseveral lions, which, you are well aware, do not exist in the gorilla\ncountry.\"\n\n\"True; but you mistake me,\" rejoined Peterkin.  \"I do not mean to make\nup the number to forty by killing three more, but by proving, almost to\ndemonstration, that we have already been the death of that number, in\naddition to those noted down.\"\n\n\"You'll find that rather difficult,\" said Jack, laughing.\n\n\"Not at all,\" cried Peterkin.  \"Let me think a minute.  You remember\nthat enormously big, hairy fellow, that looked so like an ugly old man\nthat Ralph refused point-blank to fire at him, whereupon you fired at\nhim point-blank and wounded him in the shoulder as he was running away?\"\n\n\"We treated several big fellows in that way,\" replied Jack; \"which of\nthem do you allude to?--the one that roared so loud and terrified you so\nmuch that you nearly ran away?\"\n\n\"No, no; you know well enough which one I mean.  The one that ran along\nthe edge of the stagnant pool into which you tumbled as we were coming\nback.\"\n\n\"Oh yes!  I remember,\" said Jack, laughing.\n\n\"Well, that fellow flew into such a horrible rage when he was wounded,\"\ncontinued Peterkin, \"that I am perfectly certain he went straight home\nand murdered his wife in a passion; which brings up the number to\nthirty-eight.  Then there was that old woman-gorilla that I brought down\nwhen we were descending yon hill that was covered with such splendid\nvines.  You remember?  Well, I'm quite certain that the young\nman-gorilla beside her, who ran off and escaped, was her son, and that\nhe went home straightway and died of grief.  That makes thirty-nine.\nThen--\"\n\n\"Oh, do be quiet, Peterkin, please,\" said I, with a shudder.  \"You put\nthings in such a fearfully dark and murderous light that I feel quite as\nif I were a murderer.  I feel quite uneasy, I assure you; and if it were\nnot that we have killed all these creatures in the cause of science, I\nshould be perfectly miserable.\"\n\n\"In the cause of science!\" repeated Peterkin; \"humph!  I suspect that a\ngood deal of wickedness is perpetrated under the wing of science.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Jack; \"don't you begin to grow sarcastic, Master\nPeterkin.  I abominate sarcasm, and cannot tolerate sarcastic people.\nIf you adopt that style, I shall revert to my natural habits as a\ngorilla, and tear you in pieces.\"\n\n\"There you exhibit your unnatural ignorance of your own natural habits,\"\nretorted Peterkin; \"for you ought to know that gorillas never tear men\nin pieces--their usual mode being to knock you down with a blow of their\nhuge paws.\"\n\n\"Well, I will knock you down if you prefer it.\"\n\n\"Thank you; I'd rather not.  Besides, you have almost knocked me up\nalready; so pray call a halt and let me rest a bit.\"\n\nWe were all very willing to agree to this request, having walked the\nlast two or three miles at a very quick pace.  Seating ourselves on the\ntrunk of a fallen tree, we enjoyed the beautiful prospect before us.  An\nopen vista enabled us to see beyond the wood in which we were travelling\ninto an extensive sweep of prairie-land on which the sinking sun was\nshedding a rich flood of light.  It happened to be a deliciously cool\nevening, and the chattering of numerous parrots as well as the\ntwittering songs of other birds--less gorgeous, perhaps, but more\nmusical than they--refreshed our ears as the glories of the landscape\ndid our eyes.  While we were gazing dreamily before us in silent\nenjoyment, Jack suddenly interrupted our meditations by exclaiming--\n\n\"Hist! look yonder!\"\n\nHe pointed as he spoke to a distant part of the plain on which the\nforest closely pressed.\n\n\"A zebra!\" cried I, with delight; for besides the feeling of pleasure at\nseeing this splendid creature, I entertained a hope that we might shoot\nhim and procure a steak for supper, of which at that time we stood much\nin need.\n\n\"I'm too tired to stalk it now,\" said Peterkin, with an air of\nchagrin.--\"Are you up to it, Jack?\"\n\n\"Quite; but I fear he's an animal that's very difficult to stalk in such\nan open country.--What say you, Mak?\"\n\n\"Hims no be cotched dis yer night, massa; hims too far away an' too wide\n'wake.\"\n\n\"What say you to a long shot, Peterkin?  Your rifle is sighted for four\nhundred yards, and he seems to be little more than six hundred off.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said our friend, going down on one knee and adjusting the\nsight of his piece.  Taking a long, steady aim, he fired, and in another\ninstant the zebra lay dead on the plain.  I need hardly add that our\namazement was excessive.  Even Peterkin himself could scarcely believe\nhis eyes.  Had his rifle been sighted for such a distance, the shot,\nalthough a splendid one, would not have amazed us so much, because we\nknew that our friend's aim was deadly; but as he had to elevate the\nmuzzle above the object fired at and guess the amount of elevation, the\nshot was indeed wonderful.  It was a long time before our guide could\nmove, but when he did recover himself he danced and shouted like a\nmadman with delight, and then, setting off with a bound, sped across the\nplain like a deer.\n\n\"Come along,\" cried Jack with a laugh--\"let's follow; for Mak looked so\nrabid when he went off that I believe he'll eat the beast raw before we\ncan claim our share, if we don't look sharp.\"\n\nWe all of us set off at a smart trot, and soon came to the spot where\nour prize lay.  It was a splendid creature, and in prime condition.\nAfter examining it carefully, and descanting on the beauty of its\nstriped skin, I sat down beside it and pulled out my note-book, while my\ncomrades entered the forest to search for a suitable place on which to\nencamp, and to kindle a fire.  A spot was quickly found, and I had\nscarcely finished making notes when they returned to carry the zebra\ninto the encampment.  We accomplished this with some difficulty, and\nlaid it beside the fire.  Then cutting four large steaks from its flanks\nwe proceeded to sup, after which we made our arrangements for spending\nthe night there.  We little knew the startling surprise that was in\nstore for us that night.\n\nAs the forest in that place happened to be swarming with wild animals of\nevery kind, we deemed it prudent to set a watch as well as to keep up a\nblazing fire.  Jack and I and the negro kept watch by turns; Peterkin,\nbeing still sufficiently an invalid to claim exemption from laborious\nduties, was permitted to rest undisturbed.\n\nAbout midnight I aroused Jack, and having made him sit up, in order to\nshow that he was thoroughly awake, I lay down and went to sleep.\n\nHow long I slept I cannot tell, but I was suddenly awakened by one of\nthe most tremendous roars I ever heard.  It was so chose to me that, in\nthe confusion of my sleepy brain, it seemed to be far more terrible than\nthat even of the gorilla.  I was mistaken in this, however, and no doubt\nmy semi-somnolent condition tended to increase its awfulness.\n\nSpringing into a sitting posture, and by an involuntary impulse reaching\nout my hand for my gun which lay close to me, I beheld a sight that was\ncalculated to appal the stoutest heart.  A lion of the largest size was\nin the very act of springing over the bushes and alighting on the zebra,\nwhich, as I have said, lay on the other side of the fire and not four\nyards off from us.  As the light glared in the brute's eyes, and, as it\nwere, sparkled in gleams on its shaggy mane, which streamed out under\nthe force of its majestic bound, it seemed to my bewildered gaze as\nthough the animal were in the air almost above my head, and that he must\ninevitably alight upon myself.  This, at least, is the impression left\nupon my mind now that I look back upon that terrific scene.  But there\nwas no time for thought.  The roar was uttered, the bound was made, and\nthe lion alighted on the carcass of the zebra almost in one and the same\nmoment.  I freely confess that my heart quailed within me.  Yet that did\nnot prevent my snatching up my gun; but before I had time to cock it the\ncrashing report of Jack's elephant rifle almost split the drum of my\near, and I beheld the lion drop as if it had been a stone.\n\nIt lay without motion, completely dead, and we found, on examination,\nthat the ball had smashed in the centre of its forehead and completely\npenetrated its brain.\n\nSome time elapsed before we could find words to express our feelings.\nOur guide, who had so completely enveloped his head and shoulders in\ngrass when he lay down to sleep that he was the last to spring up,\nlooked at the huge carcass of the lion with an expression of utter\nbewilderment.\n\n\"What a magnificent fellow!  And what a splendid shot!\" exclaimed\nPeterkin at last.  \"Why, Jack, I don't believe there's a finer lion in\nAfrica.  It's lucky, though, that you were on the _qui vive_.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"had it not been for you we might have been all killed by\nthis time.\"\n\n\"No fear o' dat,\" chimed in our guide, as he sat down on the lion's\nshoulder, and began to stroke its mane; \"hims was want him's supper off\nde zebra, ho! ho!  Hims got him's supper off a bullet!\"\n\n\"'Tis well that he has,\" observed Jack, as he reloaded his rifle.  \"To\nsay truth, comrades, I scarcely deserve credit for being guardian of the\ncamp, for I'm ashamed to say that I was sound asleep at the moment the\nlion roared.  How I ever managed to take so quick and so good an aim is\nmore than I can tell.  Luckily my rifle was handy, and I had fallen\nasleep in a sitting posture.  Had it been otherwise, I could scarcely\nhave been in time to prevent the brute springing on us, had he felt so\ndisposed.\"\n\nHere was now another subject for my note-book, so I sat down, and began\na minute inspection of the noble-looking animal, while my comrades,\nheaping fresh logs on the fire, sat down in front of it, and for upwards\nof an hour, \"fought their battles o'er again.\"\n\nIt was a matter of deep regret to us all that we could not afford to\ncarry away with us the skin of this lion as a memorial; but\ncircumstanced as we then were, that was out of the question, so we\ncontented ourselves with extracting his largest teeth and all his claws,\nwhich we still preserve in our museum as trophies of the adventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\n\nWE VISIT A NATURAL MENAGERIE, SEE WONDERFUL SIGHTS, AND MEET WITH\nSTRANGE ADVENTURES.\n\nWe observed, on this journey, that the elephants which we met with in\nour farthest north point were considerably smaller than those farther to\nthe south, yet though smaller animals, their tusks were much larger then\nthose of the south.  The weight of those tusks varied from twenty to\nfifty pounds, and I saw one that was actually upwards of one hundred\npounds in weight--equal, in fact, to the weight of a big boy or a little\nman.  Such tusks, however, were rare.\n\nAt nights, when we encamped near to a river or pool of water, we saw\nimmense numbers of elephants come down to drink and enjoy themselves.\nThey seemed, in fact, to be intoxicated with delight, if not with water;\nfor they screamed with joy, and filling their trunks with water, spurted\nit over themselves and each other in copious showers.  Of course, we\nnever disturbed them on such occasions, for we came to the conclusion\nthat it would be the height of barbarity and selfishness to spoil the\npleasure of so many creatures merely for the sake of a shot.\n\nFrequently we were wont to go after our supper to one of those ponds,\nwhen we chanced to be in the immediate neighbourhood of one, and lying\nconcealed among the bushes, watch by the light of the moon the strange\nhabits and proceedings of the wild creatures that came there to drink.\nThe hours thus passed were to me the most interesting by far that I\nspent in Africa.  There was something so romantic in the kind of\nscenery, in the dim mysterious light, and in the grand troops of wild\ncreatures that came there in all the pith and fire of untamed freedom to\ndrink.  It was like visiting a natural menagerie on the most magnificent\nscale; for in places where water is scarce any pool that may exist is\nthe scene of constant and ever-changing visits during the entire night.\n\nIn fact, I used to find it almost impossible to tear myself away,\nalthough I knew that repose was absolutely needful, in order to enable\nme to continue the journey on the succeeding day, and I am quite certain\nthat had not Peterkin and Jack often dragged me off in a jocular way by\nmain force, I should have remained there all night, and have fallen\nasleep probably in my ambush.\n\nOne night of this kind that we passed I shall never forget.  It was\naltogether a remarkable and tremendously exciting night; and as it is a\ngood type of the style of night entertainment to be found in that wild\ncountry, I shall describe it.\n\nIt happened on a Saturday night.  We were then travelling through a\nrather dry district, and had gone a whole day without tasting water.  As\nevening approached we came, to our satisfaction, to a large pond of\npretty good water, into which we ran knee-deep, and filling our caps\nwith water, drank long and repeated draughts.  Then we went into a piece\nof jungle about a quarter of a mile distant, and made our encampment,\nintending to rest there during the whole of the Sabbath.\n\nI may mention here that it was our usual custom to rest on the Sabbath\ndays.  This we did because we thought it right, and we came ere long to\nknow that it was absolutely needful; for on this journey southward we\nall agreed that as life and death might depend on the speed with which\nwe travelled, we were quite justified in continuing our journey on the\nSabbath.  But we found ourselves at the end of the second week so\nterribly knocked up that we agreed to devote the whole of the next\nSabbath to repose.  This we did accordingly, and found the utmost\nbenefit from it; and we could not avoid remarking, in reference to this\non the care and tenderness of our heavenly Father, who has so arranged\nthat obedience to His command should not only bring a peculiar blessing\nto our souls, but, so to speak, a natural and inevitable advantage to\nour bodies.  These reflections seemed to me to throw some light on the\npassage, \"The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.\"\nBut as this is not the place for theological disquisition, I shall not\nrefer further to that subject.\n\nNot having, then, to travel on the following day, we made up our minds\nto spend an hour or two in a place of concealment near the margin of\nthis pond; and I secretly resolved that I would spend the _whole_ night\nthere with my note-book (for the moon, we knew, would be bright), and\nmake a soft pillow of leaves on which I might drop and go to sleep when\nmy eyes refused any longer to keep open.\n\nThe moon had just begun to rise when we finished our suppers and\nprepared to go to our post of observation.  We took our rifles with us\nof course, for although we did not intend to shoot, having more than\nsufficient food already in camp, we could not tell but that at any\nmoment those weapons might be required for the defence of our lives.\nMakarooroo had been too long accustomed to see wild animals to\nunderstand the pleasure we enjoyed in merely staring at them, so he was\nleft in charge of our camp.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Peterkin, as we left the encampment, \"hurrah, for the\nmenagerie!\"\n\n\"You may well call it that,\" said Jack, \"for there's no lack of\nvariety.\"\n\n\"Are we to shoot?\" inquired Peterkin.\n\n\"Better not, I think.  We don't require meat, and there is no use in\nmurdering the poor things.  What a splendid scene!\"\n\nWe halted to enjoy the view for a few seconds.  The forest out of which\nwe had emerged bordered an extensive plain, which was dotted here and\nthere with scattered groups of trees, which gave to the country an\nexceedingly rich aspect.  In the midst of these the pond lay glittering\nin the soft moonlight like a sheet of silver.  It was surrounded on\nthree sides by low bushes and a few trees.  On the side next to us it\nwas open and fully exposed to view.  The moonlight was sufficiently\nbright to render every object distinctly visible, yet not so bright as\nto destroy the pleasant feeling of mysterious solemnity that pervaded\nthe whole scene.  It was wonderfully beautiful.  I felt almost as if I\nhad reached a new world.\n\nContinuing our walk we quickly gained the bushes that fringed the margin\nof the pool, which was nowhere more than thirty yards broad, and on our\narrival heard the hoofs of several animals that we had scared away\nclattering on the ground as they retreated.\n\n\"There they go already,\" cried Jack; \"now let us look for a hillock of\nsome kind on which to take up our position.\"\n\n\"We shall not have to look far,\" said I, \"for here seems a suitable spot\nready at our hand.\"\n\n\"Your eyes are sharp to-night, Ralph,\" observed Peterkin; \"the place is\nsplendid, so let's to work.\"\n\nLaying down our rifles, we drew our hunting-knives, and began to cut\ndown some of the underwood on the top of a small hillock that rose a\nlittle above the surrounding bushes, and commanded a clear view of the\nentire circumference of the pond.  We selected this spot for the double\nreason that it was a good point of observation and a safe retreat, as\nanimals coming to the pond to drink, from whatever quarter they might\narrive, would never think of ascending a hillock covered with bushes, if\nthey could pass round it.\n\nHaving cleared a space sufficiently large to hold us--leaving, however,\na thin screen of shrubs in front through which we intended to peep--we\nstrewed the ground with leaves, and lay down to watch with our loaded\nrifles close beside us.  We felt certain of seeing a good many animals,\nfor even during the process of preparing our unlace of retreat several\narrived, and were scared away by the noise we made.\n\nPresently we heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"There's something,\" whispered Peterkin.\n\n\"Ay,\" returned Jack.  \"What I like about this sort o' thing is your\nuncertainty as to what may turn up.  It's like deep-sea fishing.  Hist!\nlook out.\"\n\nThe steps were rapid.  Sometimes they clattered over what appeared to be\npebbly ground, then they became muffled as the animal crossed a grassy\nspot; at last it trotted out of the shade of the bushes directly\nopposite to us into the moonlight, and showed itself to be a beautiful\nlittle antelope of the long-horned kind, with a little fawn by its side.\nThe two looked timidly round for a few seconds, and snuffed the air as\nif they feared concealed enemies, and then, trotting into the water,\nslaked their thirst together.  I felt as great pleasure in seeing them\ntake a long, satisfactory draught as if I had been swallowing it myself,\nand hoped they would continue there for some time; but they had barely\nfinished when the rapid gallop of several animals was heard, and scared\nthem away instantly.\n\nThe newcomers were evidently heavy brutes, for their tread was loud and\nquite distinct, as compared with the steps of the antelopes.  A few\nseconds sufficed to disclose them to our expectant eyes.  A large herd\nof giraffes trotted to the water's edge and began to drink.  It was a\nsplendid sight to behold these graceful creatures stooping to drink, and\nthen raising their heads haughtily to a towering height as they looked\nabout from side to side.  In the course of a couple of hours we saw\nelands, springboks, gnus, leopards, and an immense variety of wild\ncreatures, some of which fawned on and played with each other, while\nothers fought and bellowed until the woods resounded with the din.\n\nWhile we were silently enjoying the sight, and I attempting to make a\nfew entries in my note-book, our attention was attracted to a cracking\nof the branches close to the right side of our hillock.\n\n\"Look out!\" whispered Jack; but the warning was scarcely needed, for we\ninstinctively seized our rifles.  A moment after our hearts leaped\nviolently as we heard a crashing step that betokened the approach of\nsome huge creature.\n\n\"Are we safe here?\"  I whispered to Jack.\n\n\"Safe enough if we keep still.  But we shall have to cut and run if an\nelephant chances to get sight of us.\"\n\nI confess that at that moment I felt uneasy.  The hillock on the summit\nof which we lay was only a place of comparative safety, because no\nanimal was likely to ascend an elevated spot without an object in view,\nand as the purpose of all the nocturnal visitors to that pond was the\nprocuring of water, we did not think it probable that any of them would\napproach unpleasantly near to our citadel; but if any wild beast should\ntake a fancy to do so, there was nothing to prevent him, and the slight\nscreen of bushes by which we were surrounded would certainly have been\nno obstacle in the way.\n\nA hunter in the African wilds, however, has not much time to think.\nDanger is usually upon him in a moment.  We had barely time to full-cock\nour rifles when the bushes near us were trodden down, and a huge black\nrhinoceros sauntered slowly up to us.  So near was he that we could have\nsprung out from our hiding-place and have caught hold of him, had we\nchosen to do so.\n\nThis enormous unwieldy monster seemed to me so large that he resembled\nan elephant on short legs, and in the dim, mysterious moonlight I could\nalmost fancy him to be one of those dreadful monsters of the\nantediluvian world of which we read so much in these days of geological\nresearch.  I held my breath and glanced at my comrades.  They lay\nperfectly motionless, with their eyes fixed on the animal, which\nhesitated on approaching our hillock.  My blood almost stagnated in my\nveins.  I thought that he must have observed us or smelt us, and was\nabout to charge.  He was only undecided as to which side of the hillock\nhe should pass by on his way to the pond.  Turning to the left, he went\ndown to the water with a heavy, rolling gait, crushing the shrubs under\nhis ponderous feet in a way that filled me with an exalted idea of his\ntremendous power.\n\nI breathed freely again, and felt as if a mighty load had been lifted\noff me.  From the suppressed sighs vented by my comrades, I judge that\nthey also had experienced somewhat similar relief.  We had not, however,\nhad time to utter a whisper before our ears were assailed by the most\ntremendous noise that we had yet heard.  It came from the opposite side\nof the pool, as if a great torrent were rushing towards us.  Presently a\nblack billow seemed to burst out of the jungle and roll down the sloping\nbank of the pond.\n\n\"Elephants!\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"Impossible,\" said I; \"they must be buffaloes.\"\n\nAt that instant they emerged into the full blaze of the moon, and showed\nthemselves to be a herd of full-grown elephants, with a number of\ncalves.  There could not have been fewer than one hundred on the margin\nof the pond; but from the closeness of their ranks and their incessant\nmovements I found it impossible to count their numbers accurately.  This\nmagnificent army began to drink and throw water about, waving their\ntrunks and trumpeting shrilly at the same time with the utmost delight.\nThe young ones especially seemed enjoy themselves immensely, and I\nobserved that their mothers were very attentive to them, caressing them\nwith their trunks and otherwise showing great fondness for their\noffspring.\n\n\"I say,\" whispered Peterkin, \"what a regiment of cavalry these fellows\nwould make, mounted by gorillas armed with scythe-blades for swords and\nHighland claymores for dirks!\"\n\n\"Ay, and cannon-revolvers in their pockets!\" added Jack.  \"But, look--\nthat hideous old rhinoceros.  He has been standing there for the last\ntwo minutes like a rock, staring intently across the water at the\nelephants.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said I.  \"Whisper softly.  He may hear us.\"\n\n\"There goes something else on our side,\" whispered Peterkin, pointing to\nthe right of our hillock.  \"Don't you see it?  There, against the--I do\nbelieve it's another giraffe!\"\n\n\"So it is!  Keep still.  His ears are sharp,\" muttered Jack, examining\nthe lock of his rifle.\n\n\"Come, come!\" said I; \"no shooting, Jack.  You know we came to see, not\nto shoot.\"\n\n\"Very true; but it's not every day one gets such a close shot at a\ngiraffe.  I _must_ procure a specimen for you, Ralph.\"\n\nJack smiled as he said this, and raised his rifle.  Peterkin at the same\nmoment quietly raised his, saying, \"If that's your game, my boy, then\nhere goes at the rhinoceros.  Don't hurry your aim; we've lots of time.\"\n\nAs I waited for the reports with breathless attention, I was much struck\nat that moment by the singularity of the circumstances in which we were\nplaced.  On our left stood the rhinoceros, not fifteen yards off; on our\nright the giraffe raised his long neck above the bushes, about twenty\nyards distant, apparently uncertain whether it was safe to advance to\nthe water; while in front lay the lake, reflecting the soft, clear\nmoonlight, and beyond that the phalanx of elephants, enjoying themselves\nvastly.  I had but two moments to take it all in at a glance, for Jack\nsaid \"Now!\" in a low tone, and instantly the loud report of the two\nrifles thundered out upon the night air.\n\nWords cannot convey, and the reader certainly cannot conceive, any idea\nof the trumpeting, roaring, crashing, shrieking, and general hubbub that\nsucceeded to the noise of our firearms.  It seemed as if the wild beasts\nof twenty menageries had simultaneously commenced to smash the woodwork\nof their cages, and to dash out upon each other in mingled fury and\nterror; for not only was the crashing of boughs and bushes and smaller\ntrees quite terrific, but the thunderous tread of the large animals was\nabsolutely awful.\n\nWe were thoroughly scared, for, in addition to all this, from the midst\nof the horrid turmoil there came forth a royal roar close behind us that\ntold of a lion having been secretly engaged in watching our proceedings;\nand we shuddered to think that, but for our firing, he might have sprung\nupon us as we lay there, little dreaming of his presence.\n\nSince our last adventure with the king of beasts, Makarooroo had\nentertained us with many anecdotes of the daring of lions, especially of\nthose monsters that are termed man-eaters; so that when we heard the\nroar above referred to, we all three sprang to our feet and faced about\nwith the utmost alacrity.  So intent were we on looking out for this\ndreadful foe--for we had made up our minds that it must be a man-eating\nlion--that we were utterly indifferent to the other animals.  But they\nwere not indifferent to us; for the wounded rhinoceros, catching sight\nof us as we stood with our backs towards him, charged at once up the\nhillock.\n\nTo utter three simultaneous yet fearfully distinct yells of terror,\nspring over the low parapet of bushes, and fly like the wind in three\ndifferent directions, was the work of a moment.  In dashing madly down\nthe slope my foot caught in a creeping shrub, and I fell heavily to the\nearth.\n\nThe fall probably saved my life, for before I could rise the rhinoceros\nsprang completely over me in its headlong charge.  So narrow was my\nescape that the edge of one of its ponderous feet alighted on the first\njoint of the little finger of my left hand, and crushed it severely.\nIndeed, had the ground not been very soft, it must infallibly have\nbruised it off altogether.  The moment it had passed I jumped up, and\nturning round, ran in the opposite direction.  I had scarcely gone ten\npaces when a furious growl behind me, and the grappling sound as of two\nanimals in deadly conflict, followed by a fierce howl, led me to\nconclude that the lion and the rhinoceros had unexpectedly met each\nother, and that in their brief conflict the former had come off second\nbest.\n\nBut I gave little heed to that.  My principal thought at that moment was\nmy personal safety; so I ran on as fast as I could in the direction of\nour encampment, for which point, I had no doubt, my companions would\nalso make.\n\nI had not run far when the growl of a lion, apparently in front, caused\nme to stop abruptly.  Uncertain of the exact position of the brute, I\nturned off to one side, and retreated cautiously and with as little\nnoise as possible, yet with a feeling of anxiety lest he should spring\nupon me unawares.  But my next step showed me that the lion was\notherwise engaged.  Pushing aside a few leaves that obstructed my\nvision, I suddenly beheld a lion in the midst of an open space, crouched\nas if for a spring.  Instinctively I threw forward the muzzle of my\nrifle; but a single glance showed me that his tail, not his head, was\ntowards me.  On looking beyond, I observed the head and shoulders of\nJack, who, like the lion, was also in a crouching position, staring\nfixedly in the face of his foe.  They were both perfectly motionless,\nand there could not have been more than fifteen or twenty yards between\nthem.\n\nThe true position of affairs at once flashed across me.  Jack in his\nflight had unwittingly run almost into the jaws of the lion; and I now\nfelt convinced that this must be a second lion, for it could not have\nbeen the one that was disturbed by the rhinoceros, as I had been running\ndirectly away from the spot where these two brutes had met.  Jack had\ncrouched at once.  We had often talked, over our camp-fire, of such an\nevent as unexpectedly meeting a lion face to face; and Peterkin, who\nknew a good deal about such matters, had said that in such a case a\nman's only chance was to crouch and stare the lion out of countenance.\nWe laughed at this; but he assured us positively that he had himself\nseen it done to tigers in India, and added that if a man turned and ran\nhis destruction would be certain.  To fire straight in the face of a\nlion in such a position would be excessively dangerous; for while the\nbullet _might_ kill, it was more than probable it would glance off the\nbone of the forehead, which would be presented at an angle to the\nhunter.  The best thing to do, he said, was to stare steadily at the\ncreature until it began to wince, which, if not a wounded beast, it\nwould certainly do; and then, when it turned slowly round, to slink\naway, take aim at its heart, and fire instantly.\n\nThe moon was shining full in Jack's face, which wore an expression of\nintense ferocity I had never before witnessed, and had not believed it\npossible that such a look could have been called up by him.  The lower\npart of his face, being shrouded in his black beard, was undiscernible;\nbut his cheeks and forehead were like cold marble.  His dark brows were\ncompressed so tightly that they seemed knotted, and beneath them his\neyes glittered with an intensity that seemed to me supernatural.  Not a\nmuscle moved; his gaze was fixed; and it was not difficult to fancy that\nhe was actually, instead of apparently, petrified.\n\nI could not, of course, observe the visage of the lion, and, to say\ntruth, I had no curiosity on that point; for just then it occurred to me\nthat I was directly in the line of fire, and that if my friend missed\nthe lion there was every probability of his killing me.  I was now in an\nagony of uncertainty.  I knew not what to do.  If I were to endeavour to\nget out of the way, I might perhaps cause Jack to glance aside, and so\ninduce the lion to spring.  If, on the other hand, I should remain where\nI was, I might be shot.  In this dilemma it occurred to me that, as Jack\nwas a good shot and the lion was very close, it was extremely unlikely\nthat I should be hit; so I resolved to bide my chance, and offering up a\nsilent prayer, awaited the issue.\n\nIt was not long of coming.  The fixed gaze of a bold human eye cowed at\nlast even the king of the woods.  The lion slowly and almost\nimperceptibly rose, and sidled gently round, with the intention,\ndoubtless, of bounding into the jungle.  I saw that if it did so it\nwould pass very close to me so I cocked both barrels and held my piece\nin readiness.\n\nThe click of my locks attracted the lion's attention; its head turned\nslightly round.  At that instant Jack's rifle sprang to his shoulder,\nand the loud crack of its report was mingled with and drowned by the\nroar of the lion, as he sprang with a terrible bound, not past me, but\nstraight towards me.  I had no time to aim, but throwing the gun quickly\nto my shoulder, drew both triggers at once.\n\nI had forgotten, in my perturbation, that I carried Peterkin's heavy\nelephant rifle, charged with an immense quantity of powder and a couple\nof six-ounce balls.  My shoulder was almost dislocated by the recoil,\nand I was fairly knocked head over heels.  A confused sound of yells and\nroars filled my ear for a moment.  I struggled to collect my faculties.\n\n\"Hollo!  Jack!--Ralph! where are you?\" shouted a voice that I well knew\nto be that of Peterkin.  \"Hurrah I'm coming.  Don't give in!  I've\nkilled him!  The rhinoceros is dead as a door-nail!  Where have you--\"\n\nI heard no more, having swooned away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\n\nSTRANGE AND TERRIBLE DISCOVERIES--JACK IS MADE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF AN\nARMY.\n\nWhen my consciousness returned, I found myself lying on my back beside\nour camp-fire, with my head resting on Peterkin's knee; and the first\nsound I heard was his pleasant voice, as he said--\n\n\"All right, Jack; he's coming round.  I'm quite certain that no serious\ndamage is done.  I know well what sort o' rap he must have got.  It'll\nbother him a little at first, but it won't last long.\"\n\nComforted not a little by this assurance, I opened my eyes and looked\nup.\n\n\"What has happened?\"  I inquired faintly.\n\n\"Ah! that's right, Ralph.  I'm glad to hear your voice again.  D'you\nknow, I thought at first it was all over with you?\"\n\n\"Over with him!\" echoed Peterkin; \"it's only begun with him.  Ralph's\ndays of valorous deeds are but commencing.--Here, my boy; put this flask\nto your mouth.  It's lucky I fetched it with us.  Here, drink.\"\n\n\"No, not until you tell me what has occurred,\" said I, for I still felt\nconfused in my brain.\n\n\"Then I _won't_ tell you a word until you drink,\" repeated my friend, as\nhe looked anxiously in my face and held the flask to my lips.\n\nI sipped a mouthful, and felt much revived.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Peterkin, \"I'll tell you what has happened.  We've\nfloored a rhinoceros and a giraffe and a lion, which, to my thinking, is\na pretty fair bag to make after dusk of a Saturday night!  And my big\nrifle has floored _you_, which is the least satisfactory part of the\nnight's entertainment, but which wouldn't have occurred had you\nremembered my instructions, which you never do.\"\n\n\"Oh, I recollect now,\" said I, as the spirits revived me.  \"I'm all\nright.--But, Jack, I trust that you have not received damage?\"\n\n\"Not a scratch, I'm thankful to say; though I must confess I was near\ncatching an ugly wound.\"\n\n\"How so?\"  I inquired quickly, observing a peculiar smile on Jack's face\nas he spoke.\n\n\"Oh, make your mind easy,\" put in Peterkin; \"it was just a small bit of\nan escape he made.  When you let drive at the lion so effectively, one\nof the balls went in at his mouth and smashed its way out at the back of\nhis skull.  The other ball shaved his cheek, and lodged in a tree not\ntwo inches from Jack's nose.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\" cried I, starting up, regardless of the pain\noccasioned to my injured shoulder by the movement, and gazing intently\nin Jack's face.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said he, smiling; \"you must not be so reckless, Ralph.\nLie down again, sir.\"\n\n\"Peterkin, you should not talk lightly of so narrow an escape,\" said I\nreproachfully.  \"The fact that such a terrible catastrophe has nearly\noccurred ought to solemnise one.\"\n\n\"Granted, my dear boy; but the fact that such a catastrophe did _not_\noccur, ought, I hold, to make us jolly.  There's no managing a fellow\nlike you, Ralph.  I knew that if I told you of this gravely, you would\nget into such a state of consternational self-reproachativeness, so to\nspeak, that you would infallibly make yourself worse.  And now that I\ntell it to you `lightly,' as you call it, you take to blowing me up.\"\n\nI smiled as my friend said this, and held out my hand, which he grasped\nand squeezed.  Feeling at the moment overcome with drowsiness, I\nunconsciously retained it in my grasp, and thus fell sound asleep.\n\nThree days after this misadventure I was nearly as well as ever, and we\nwere once more journeying by forced marches towards the south.  Two days\nmore, we calculated, would bring us to Mbango's village.  As the end of\nour journey approached, we grew more desperately anxious to push\nforward, lest we should be too late to give them timely warning of the\nslave-dealer's approach.  We also became more taciturn, and I could see\nplainly that the irrepressible forebodings that filled my own heart,\nwere shared by my companions.  Poor Makarooroo never spoke, save in\nreply to questions addressed pointedly to himself; and seeing the state\nof his mind, we forbore to trouble him with conversation.\n\nYet, even while in this anxious state, I could not avoid noticing the\nsingular variety and beauty of both the animal and the vegetable kingdom\nin the regions through which we passed.\n\nIn one part of our journey we had to cross a portion of what is called\ndesert country, but which, notwithstanding its name, was covered with\ngrass, and in many places with bushes, and even trees.  Its vegetation,\nhowever, as compared with other parts of the country, was light; and it\nwas almost entirely destitute of water, there being no rivers or\nsprings; only a few pools of rain-water were to be found in the hard\nbeds of ancient river-courses.  This desert land was inhabited by\nnumbers of bushmen and other natives, as well as by large quantities of\ngame of various kinds.  But what struck me as being most singular was\nthe great variety of tuberous roots with which the region was supplied,\nand which were evidently designed by our beneficent Creator to make up\nto the inhabitants in a great degree for the want of a full supply of\nwater.\n\nI also observed, with much interest, a species of plant which, like man,\nis capable of being, as it were, acclimatised.  It is not by nature a\ntuber-bearing plant; yet here it had become so, in order to be able to\nretain a sufficiency of moisture during the dry season.  Makarooroo also\ndug up for us several tuber-roots, which were the size of a large\nturnip, and filled with a most delicious juice, which, as we were much\noppressed with thirst at the time, appeared to us like nectar.  Besides\nthese, we also procured water-melons in abundance at certain spots,\nwhich were a great treat, not only to us, but also to elephants,\nrhinoceroses, antelopes, and many other animals, whose footprints we\nfound in great numbers, and whose depredations among the water-melons\nwere very evident.\n\nDuring the whole of this journey we made a point, as I have already\nremarked, of avoiding man; not that we were indifferent to him, but\nanxious not to be detained at that particular time.  We were very\nfortunate in this matter, for we succeeded in eluding the observation of\nthe natives of many villages that we passed, in escaping others by\nflight, and in conciliating those who caught us by making them liberal\ngifts of beads.\n\nOne day we came to a halt under the most magnificent tree I ever saw.\nIt was a mowano tree, whose trunk consisted of six stems united in one.\nThe circumference a yard or so from the ground was eighty-four feet--\nupwards of nine yards in diameter.\n\n\"What a tree for a nobleman's park!\" said Jack, as we gazed at it, lost\nin admiration.\n\n\"Ay; and behold a gentleman worthy to take up his residence under it,\"\nsaid Peterkin, pointing as he spoke to a living creature that sat among\nthe grass near its roots.\n\n\"What can it be?\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"The original father of all frogs!\" replied Peterkin, as he darted\nforward and killed the thing with a stick.\n\n\"I believe it _is_ a frog,\" said Jack.\n\nWe all burst into a fit of laughter, for undoubtedly it _was_ a frog,\nbut certainly the largest by far that any of us had ever seen.  It was\nquite as large as a chicken!\n\n\"What a shame to have killed it!\" said I.  \"Why did you do it?\"\n\n\"Shame!  It was no shame.  In the first place, I killed it because I\nwish you to make scientific inspection of it; and in the second place, I\nwanted to eat it.  Why should not we as well as Frenchmen eat frogs?  By\nthe way, that reminds me that we might introduce this giant species into\nFrance, and thereby make our fortunes.\"\n\n\"You greedy fellow,\" cried Jack, who was busying himself in lighting the\nfire, \"your fortune is made already.  How many would you have?\"\n\n\"D'ye know, Jack, I have been in possession of my fortune, as you call\nit, so short a time that I cannot realise the fact that I have it.--\nHollo!  Mak, what's wrong with you?\"\n\nPeterkin thus addressed our guide because he came into the camp at that\nmoment with a very anxious expression of countenance.\n\n\"Dere hab bin fight go on here,\" said he, showing several broken arrows,\nstained with blood, which he had picked up near our encampment.\n\n\"Ha! so there has, unless these have been shot at wild beasts,\" said\nJack, examining the weapons carefully.\n\n\"No, massa; no shot at wild beast.  De wild beast hab bin here too, but\ndey come for to eat mans after he dead.\"\n\n\"Come, let us see the spot,\" said Jack.\n\nMakarooroo at once led the way, and we all followed him to a place not a\nhundred yards distant, where there were evident traces of a fight having\ntaken place.  Jack seemed to be much distressed at the sight.\n\n\"There can be no question as to the fact,\" he remarked as we returned to\nour fire; \"and at any other time or in any other place I would have\nthought nothing of it, for we know well enough that the natives here\noften go to war with each other; but just at _this_ time, and so near to\nour friend Mbango--I fear, I fear much that that villain has been before\nus.\"\n\n\"No been long, massa,\" said Makarooroo earnestly.  \"If we go quick we\nketch 'im.\"\n\n\"We _shall_ go quick, Mak.  But in order to do that, we must eat well,\nand sleep at least an hour or so.  If we push on just now, after a hard\nday's journey, without food or rest, we shall make but slow progress;\nand even if we did come up with the slave-dealer, we should not be in a\nvery fit state for a battle.\"\n\nThis was so obvious that we all felt the wisdom of Jack's remarks; so we\nate a hearty supper, and then lay down to rest.  Peterkin declared the\nfrog to be excellent, but I could not at that time make up my mind to\ntry it.\n\nAn hour and a half after lying down, our guide awakened us, and we set\nforth again with recruited energies.\n\nThat night the lions and hyenas roared around us more than was their\nwont, as if they were aware of our anxious condition, and were desirous\nof increasing our discomforts.  We had to keep a sharp lookout, and once\nor twice discharged our rifles in the direction of the nearest sounds,\nnot in the expectation of hitting any of the animals, but for the\npurpose of scaring them away.\n\nTowards morning we came out upon an open plain, and left these evil\nprowlers of the night behind us.\n\nAbout daybreak we came within sight of Mbango's village, but the light\nwas not sufficient to enable us to distinguish any object clearly.  Here\nagain we came upon traces of war, in the shape of broken arrows and\ndaggers, and human bones; for the poor wretches who had been slain had\nbeen at once devoured by wild beasts.\n\nHurrying forward with intense anxiety, we reached the outskirts of the\nvillage; and here a scene presented itself that was well calculated to\nfill our breasts with horror and with the deepest anxiety.  Many of the\nhouses had been set on fire, and were reduced to ashes.  The mangled\ncorpses of human beings were seen lying here and there amongst the\nembers--some partially devoured by wild beasts, others reduced to simple\nskeletons, and their bones left to whiten on the ruins of their old\nhomes.  In one place the form of a woman tied to a tree, and dreadfully\nmangled, showed that torture had been added to the other horrors of the\nattack.\n\nWith feelings of mingled rage, pity, and anxiety, we hastened towards\nthe hut that had been the residence of Mbango, the chief.  We found it,\nlike the rest, in ruins, and among them discovered the remains of a\nchild.  Recollecting the little son of our friend Njamie, Okandaga's\nguardian, I turned the body over in some anxiety; but the features were\ntoo much mutilated to be recognisable.\n\n\"Alas! alas!\"  I exclaimed, as we collected in a group round this\nremnant of a little child, \"what a dreadful sight!  What an unhappy race\nof beings!  Without doubt our friends have been slain, or carried into\ncaptivity.\"\n\nPoor Makarooroo, who had been from the first going about among the ruins\nlike a maniac, with a bewildered air of utter despair on his sable\ncountenance, looked at me as if he hoped for a slight word that might\nreanimate hope in his bosom.  But I could give him none, for I myself\nfelt hopeless.\n\nNot so, Jack.  With that buoyancy of spirit that was peculiar to him, he\nsuggested many ideas that consoled our guide not a little.\n\n\"You see,\" said he, \"the rascally Portuguese trafficker in human flesh\nwould naturally try to effect his object with as little bloodshed as\npossible.  He would just fight until he had conquered, not longer; and\nthen he would try to take as many prisoners as he could, in order to\ncarry them away into slavery.  Now, I cannot conceive it possible that\nhe could catch the whole tribe.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" interrupted Peterkin; \"he had a comparatively small\nparty.  To take a whole tribe prisoners with such a band were\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Ay, but you forget,\" said I, \"that he might easily prevail on some\nother tribe to go to war along with him, and thus capture nearly the\nwhole.  Yet some must have escaped into the woods, and it is probable\nthat among these may have been the chief and his household.  Okandaga\nmay be safe, and not far off, for all we know.\"\n\nThe guide shook his head.\n\n\"At any rate,\" observed Jack, \"if caught they would certainly be guarded\nwith care from injury; so that if we could only find out which way they\nhave gone, we might pursue and attack them.\"\n\n\"Four men attack forty or fifty!\" said I despondingly.\n\n\"Ay, Ralph.  Why not?\" asked Peterkin.\n\n\"Oh, I doubt not our pluck to do it,\" I replied; \"but I doubt very much\nour chances of success.\"\n\nWhile we were yet speaking our attention was attracted by a low wail,\nand the appearance of some living object creeping amongst the ruins not\nfar from us.  At first we thought it must be a beast of prey lurking in\nthe neighbourhood of the dead, and impatient at our having interrupted\nits hideous banquet; but presently the object sat up and proved to be a\nwoman.  Yet she was so covered with blood and dust, and so awfully\nhaggard in appearance, that we could with difficulty believe her to be a\nhuman being.\n\nAt first she appeared to be in ignorance of our presence.  And indeed so\nshe actually was; for her whole soul was absorbed in the contemplation\nof the dead and mangled body of an infant which lay in her arms, and\nwhich she pressed ever and anon with frantic energy to her breast,\nuttering occasionally a wail of such heart-broken sadness that the tears\nsprang irresistibly into my eyes while I gazed upon her.  There needed\nno explanation of her tale of woe.  The poor mother had crept back to\nher hut after the fierce din of battle was over to search for her child,\nand she had found it; but ah, who can conceive the unutterable anguish\nof heart that its finding had occasioned!\n\n\"Speak to her, Mak,\" said Peterkin, in a husky voice; \"she will be less\nafraid of you, no doubt, than of us.\"\n\nOur guide advanced.  The slight noise he made in doing so attracted the\npoor woman's attention, and caused her to look up with a wild, quick\nglance.  The instant she saw us she leaped up with the agility of a\nleopard, clasped her dead child tightly to her breast, and uttering\nshriek upon shriek, rushed headlong into the jungle.\n\n\"After her!\" cried Jack, bounding forward in pursuit.  \"She's our only\nchance of gaining information.\"\n\nWe all felt the truth of this, and joined in the chase at top speed.\nBut although we ran fast and well, the affrighted creature at first\noutstripped us.  Then, as we tired her out and drew near, she doubled on\nher track, and dived hither and thither among the thick underwood in a\nway that rendered it exceedingly difficult to catch her.\n\nPeterkin was the first to come up with her.  He gradually but\nperseveringly ran her down.  When he came within a few yards of her, the\npoor creature sank with a low wail to the ground, and turning half\nround, glanced at her pursuer with a timid, imploring, yet despairing\nexpression.  Alas! despair mingled with it, because she knew too well\nthe terrible cruelty of savage men when their blood is up, and she knew\nnothing yet of the hearts of Christians.\n\nPeterkin, whose susceptible nature was ever easily touched, felt a\nthrill of self-reproach as the thought suddenly occurred that, however\ngood his intentions might be, he was in reality running a helpless woman\ndown like a bloodhound.  He stopped short instantly, and acting, as on\nmost occasions he did, impulsively, he threw his rifle away from him,\nunclasped his belt, and throwing it, with his hunting-knife, also away,\nsat down on the ground and held out both his hands.\n\nThere was something almost ludicrous in the act, but it had the effect\nof, to some extent, relieving the poor woman's fears.  Seeing this, as\nwe successively came up we all laid down our rifles, and stood before\nthe crouching creature with our empty hands extended towards her, to\nshow that we meant her no harm.  Still, although she seemed less\nterrified, she trembled violently, and panted from her recent exertion,\nbut never for a moment relaxed her hold of the dead child.\n\n\"Speak to her, Mak,\" said Jack, as the guide came up.  \"Tell her who and\nwhat we are at once, to relieve her feelings; and let her know\nespecially that we are the bitter enemies of the villain who has done\nthis deed.\"\n\nWhile Makarooroo explained, the woman's countenance seemed to brighten\nup, and in a few minutes she began to tell with great volubility the\nevents of the attack.  The trader, she said, had come suddenly on them\nin the dead of night with a large band, and had at once routed the\nwarriors of the village, who were completely taken by surprise.  A few\nhad escaped; but Mbango, with Okandaga and his household, had been taken\nprisoners, and carried away with many others.\n\n\"How long is it since this happened?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"She say two days, massa.  Den dey go off to 'tack King Jambai.\"\n\n\"Ah! then it is too late to save him,\" returned Jack, in a tone of\nsadness.\n\nOur hearts sank on learning this; but on questioning the woman further,\nwe found that the marauding party, deeming themselves too weak to attack\nso large a village as that of King Jambai, had talked of turning aside\nto secure the assistance of another tribe not far distant, who, they\nknew, would be too glad to pick a quarrel with that chief.\n\n\"Then we shall do it yet!\" cried Jack, springing up energetically.  \"We\nshall be in time to warn Jambai and to save Okandaga and her friends.\nCome, Mak, cheer up; things begin to look better.\"\n\nThe cheerful, confident voice in which our friend said this raised my\nhopes wonderfully, even although, on consideration, I could not see that\nour chances of success were very great.  Our guide was visibly\ncomforted, and we stepped aside to pick up our rifles with considerable\nalacrity.\n\nDuring the brief period in which we were thus employed, the poor woman\nmanaged to creep away, and when we again looked round she was gone.  Our\nfirst impulse was to give chase again, but the thought of the needless\nterror which that would occasion her deterred us, and before we could\nmake up our minds what to do she was almost beyond our reach, and would\ncertainly have cost us an hour of search, if not longer, to find her.\nTime pressed.  To reach the village of King Jambai with the utmost\npossible speed was essential to the safety of the tribe, so we resolved\nto leave her, feeling as we did so that the poor creature could sustain\nherself on roots and berries without much difficulty or suffering until\nshe reached the village of some neighbouring tribe.\n\nWe now pushed on again by forced marches, travelling by night and by\nday, shooting just enough game as we required for food, and taking no\nmore rest than was absolutely necessary to enable us to hold on our way.\nIn a short time we reached the village, which, to our great joy, we\nfound in much the same state as it was when we left it.\n\nKing Jambai received us with great delight, and his people went into a\nstate of immense rejoicing--firing guns, and shouting, and beating\nkettles and drums, in honour of the arrival of the \"white faces;\" which\nname was certainly a misnomer, seeing that our faces had by that time\nbecome the very reverse of white--indeed they were little lighter than\nthe countenances of the good people by whom we were surrounded.\n\nBut the king's consternation was very great when we told him the reason\nof our unexpected visit, and related to him the details of the terrible\ncalamity that had befallen poor Mbango and his people.  He appeared\nsincerely grateful for the effort we had made to warn him of the\nimpending attack, and seemed unable to express his thanks when we\noffered to aid him in the defence of his village.\n\nWe now deemed this a fitting moment to tell the king boldly of our\nhaving assisted in the escape of Okandaga from his village, and beg his\nforgiveness.  He granted this at once, but strongly advised us to keep\nour secret quiet, and leave it to him to account to his warriors for the\nreappearance of the runaway maiden when retaken.  Of course we could\nmake no objection to this, so after thanking him we entered upon a\ndiscussion of the best method of frustrating the slave-dealer's designs.\n\n\"Tell the king,\" said Jack, addressing himself to our guide, \"that if he\nwill make me commander-in-chief of his forces, I will show him how white\nwarriors manage to circumvent their enemies.\"\n\n\"I would like much,\" said Peterkin, laughing, \"to know how Mak will\ntranslate the word `circumvent.'  Your style is rather flowery, Jack,\nfor such an interpreter; and upon my word, now I think of it, your\npresumption is considerable.  How do you know that _I_ do not wish to be\ncommander-in-chief myself?\"\n\n\"I shall make over the command to you with all my heart, if you wish\nit,\" said Jack, smiling blandly.\n\n\"Nay, I'll none of it.  However suited I may be to the work, the work is\nnot suited to me, so I resign in your favour.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Jack, \"since you decline to accept the chief command,\nI'll make you my second.  Mak shall be my _aide-de-camp_; you and Ralph\nshall be generals of divisions.\"\n\n\"I thank you much, my honoured and honourable generalissimo; but perhaps\nbefore being thus liberal of your favours, it were well to ascertain\nthat your own services are accepted.\"\n\n\"That is soon done.--What says the king, Mak?\"\n\n\"Hims say that him's delighted to git you, an' you may doos how you\nlike.\"\n\n\"That's plain and explicit.  You see, Peterkin, that I'm fairly\ninstalled; so you and I will take a short walk together, and hold a\nconsultation as to our plans in the approaching campaign, while Ralph\narranges our hut and makes things comfortable.\"\n\n\"A glorious campaign, truly, to serve in an army of baboons, led by a\nwhite gorilla!  I would deem it almost comical, did I not see too sure a\nprobability of bloodshed before its conclusion,\" remarked Peterkin.\n\n\"That you shall not see, if I can prevent it; and it is for the purpose\nof consulting you on that point, and claiming your services in an old\nand appropriate character, that I drag you along with me now,\" said\nJack, as he rose, and, making a bow to the king, left the hut.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR WAR, AND PECULIAR DRILL.\n\nThe plan which Jack and Peterkin concocted, while I was engaged in\nmaking the interior of our old residence as comfortable as possible, was\nas follows:--\n\nScouts were, in the first place, to be sent out that night all over the\ncountry, to ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy.  Then, when the\nenemy should be discovered, they were to send back one of their number\nto report; while the remainder should remain to dog their steps, if need\nbe, in order to ascertain whether Mbango and Okandaga were in their\npossession, and if so, where they were kept--whether in the midst of the\nwarriors or in their rear.\n\nThis settled, the remainder of the warriors of the village were to be\ncollected together, and a speech to be made to them by Jack, who should\nexplain to them that they were to be divided into two bands: all who\ncarried guns to be under the immediate charge of Jack himself; the\nothers, carrying bows and spears, to be placed under me.  Peterkin was\nto act a peculiar part, which will appear in the course of narration.\n\nHaving partaken of a hearty supper, we assembled the scouts, and having,\nthrough Makarooroo, given them their instructions, sent them away just\nas the shades of night began to fall.  We next caused a huge bonfire to\nbe kindled, and round this all the men of the village assembled, to the\nextent of several hundreds.  The king soon appeared, and mounting the\ntrunk of a fallen tree, made a long speech to his warriors, telling them\nof the danger that threatened them, in such vivid and lively terms that\nthe greater part of them began to exhibit expressions of considerable\nuneasiness on their countenances.  He then told them of the trouble that\nwe had taken, in order to give them timely warning--whereat they cast\nupon us looks of gratitude; and after that introduced Jack to them as\ntheir commander-in-chief, saying, that as a white man led the enemy,\nnothing could be better than that a white man should lead them to meet\nthe enemy--whereat the sable warriors gave a shout of satisfaction and\napproval.\n\nHaving been thus introduced, Jack mounted the trunk of the fallen tree,\nand Makarooroo got up beside him to interpret.  He began, like a wise\ndiplomatist, by complimenting King Jambai, and spoke at some length on\ncourage in general, and on the bravery of King Jambai's warriors in\nparticular; which, of course, he took for granted.  Then he came to\nparticulars, and explained as much of his intended movements as he\ndeemed it good for them to know; and wound up by saying that he had\nthree words of command to teach them, which they must learn to\nunderstand and act upon that very night.  They were, \"Forward!\"  \"Halt!\"\nand \"Fire!\"  By saying the first of these words very slow and in a\ndrawling voice, thus, \"Forw-a-a-a-a-a-rd!\" and the second in a quick,\nsharp tone, and the third in a ferocious yell that caused the whole band\nto start, he actually got them to understand and distinguish the\ndifference between the commands, and to act upon them in the course of\nhalf an hour.\n\nThe drill of his army being thus completed, Jack dismissed them with a\ncaution to hold themselves in readiness to answer promptly the first\ncall to arms; and the king enforced the caution by quietly assuring them\nthat the man who did not attend to this order, and otherwise respect and\nobey Jack as if he were the king, should have his heart, eyes, and liver\ntorn out, and the rest of his carcass cast to the dogs--a threat which\nseemed to us very horrible and uncalled for, but which, nevertheless,\nwas received by the black warriors with perfect indifference.\n\n\"Now, Mak,\" said Jack, as he descended to the ground, \"do you come with\nme, and help me to place sentries.\"\n\n\"W'at be dat, massa?\"\n\n\"Men who are placed to guard the village from surprise during the\nnight,\" explained Jack.\n\n\"Ho! dat be de ting; me know someting 'bout dat.\"\n\n\"No doubt you do, but I daresay you don't know the best way to place\nthem; and perhaps you are not aware that the pretty little threat\nuttered by the king shall be _almost_ carried out in the case of every\nman who shall be found asleep at his post or who shall desert it.\"\n\nThe guide grinned and followed his commander in silence, while I\nreturned to our hut and busied myself in cleaning the rifles and making\nother preparations for the expected fight.\n\nAt an early hour on the following morning we were awakened by the\narrival of one of the scouts, who reported that the Portuguese trader,\nwith a strong and well-armed force, was encamped on the margin of a\nsmall pond about fifteen miles distant from the village.  The scout had\ngone straight to the spot on being sent out, knowing that it was a\nlikely place for them to encamp, if they should encamp at all.  And here\nhe found them making active preparations for an attack on the village.\nCreeping like a serpent through the grass, the scout approached near\nenough to overhear their arrangements, which were to the elect that the\nattack should take place at midnight of the following day.  He observed\nthat there were many prisoners in the camp--men, women, and children--\nand these were to be left behind, in charge of a small party of armed\nmen; while the main body, under the immediate command of the Portuguese\ntrader, should proceed to the attack of the village.\n\nFrom the scout's description of the prisoners, we became convinced that\nthey were none other than our friends Mbango and his people, and one\nwoman answering to the description of Okandaga was among them.\n\n\"So, Mak, we shall save her yet,\" cried Jack heartily, slapping the\nshoulder of the guide, whose honest visage beamed with returning hope.\n\n\"Yis, massa.  S'pose we go off dis hour and fight 'em?\"\n\n\"Nay; that were somewhat too hasty a movement.  `Slow but sure' must be\nour motto until night.  Then we shall pounce upon our foes like a\nleopard on his prey.  But ask the scout if that is all he has got to\ntell us.\"\n\n\"Hims say, massa, dat hims find one leetle chile--one boy--when hims go\naway from de camp to come back to here.\"\n\n\"A boy!\" repeated Jack; \"where--how?\"\n\n\"In de woods, where hims was trow'd to die; so de scout take him up and\nbring him to here.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor child!\" said I; \"no doubt it must have been sick, and being a\nburden, has been left behind.  But stay.  How could that be possible if\nit was found between the camp and this village?\"\n\nOn further inquiry, we ascertained that the scout, after hearing what he\nthought enough of their arrangements, had travelled some distance beyond\nthe encampment, in order to make sure that there were no other bands\nconnected with the one he had left, and it was while thus engaged that\nhe stumbled on the child, which seemed to be in a dying condition.\n\n\"Hims say, too,\" continued Makarooroo, after interpreting the above\ninformation, \"that there be one poor woman in awfable sorrow, screechin'\nand hollerowin' like one lion.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" exclaimed Peterkin.  \"Describe her to us.\"\n\nThe scout did so as well as he could.\n\n\"As sure as we live,\" cried Peterkin, \"it is our friend Njamie, and the\nchild must be her boy!  Come, show us the little fellow.\"\n\nWe all ran out and followed the scout to his hut, where we found his\nwives--for he had three of them--nursing the child as tenderly as if it\nhad been their own.  It was very much wasted, evidently through want of\nfood and over-fatigue; but we instantly recognised the once sturdy\nlittle son of Njamie in the faded little being before us.  He, too,\nrecognised us, for his bright spectral eyes opened wide when he saw us.\n\n\"I knew it,\" said I.\n\n\"I told you so,\" cried Peterkin.--\"Now, Mak, pump him, and let's hear\nwhat he knows.\"\n\nThe poor child was far too much exhausted to undergo the pumping process\nreferred to.  He could merely answer that Njamie and Okandaga and Mbango\nwere prisoners in the camp, and then turned languidly away, as if he\ndesired rest.\n\n\"Poor boy!\" said Peterkin tenderly, as he laid his hand gently on the\nchild's woolly pate.--\"Tell them, Mak, to look well after him here, and\nthey shall be paid handsomely for--nay\" (here he interrupted himself),\n\"don't say that.  'Tis a bad thing to offer to pay for that which people\nare willing to do for love.\"\n\n\"Right, lad,\" said Jack: \"we can easily make these poor folk happy by\ngiving them something afterwards, without saying that it is bestowed\nbecause of their kindness to the boy.  The proper reward of diligent\nsuccessful labour is a prize, but the best reward of love and kindness\nis a warm, hearty recognition of their existence.--Just tell them, Mak,\nthat we are glad to see them so good and attentive to the little chap.--\nAnd now, my generals, if it is consistent with your other engagements, I\nwould be glad to have a little private consultation with you.\"\n\n\"Ready and willing, my lord,\" said Peterkin, as we followed Jack towards\nthe king's palace.  \"But,\" he added seriously, \"I don't like to be a\ngeneral of _division_ at all.\"\n\n\"Why not, Peterkin?\"\n\n\"Why, you see, when I was at school I found division so uncommonly\ndifficult, and suffered so much, mentally and physically, in the\nlearning of it, that I have a species of morbid antipathy to the very\nname.  I even intend to refuse a seat in parliament, when offered to me,\nbecause of the divisions that are constantly going on there.  If you\ncould only make me a general of subtraction now, or--\"\n\n\"That,\" interrupted Jack, \"were easily done, by deducting you from the\nforce altogether, and commanding you to remain at home.\"\n\n\"In which case,\" rejoined Peterkin, \"I should have to become general of\naddition, by revolunteering my services, in order to prevent the whole\nexpedition from resolving itself into General Muddle, whose name and\nservices are well-known in all branches of military and civil service.\"\n\n\"So that,\" added Jack, \"it all comes to this, that you and Ralph and I\nmust carry on the war by rule of three, each taking his just and\nappropriate proportion of the work to be done.  Now, to change the\nsubject, there's the sun getting up, and so is the king, if I may judge\nfrom the stir in his majesty's household.\"\n\nHaving begged the king to assemble his warriors together, Jack now\nproceeded to divide them into four companies, or bands, over which he\nappointed respective leaders.  All the men who possessed guns were\nassembled together in one band, numbering about one hundred and fifty\nmen.  These Jack subdivided into two companies, one including a hundred,\nthe other fifty men.  The remainder, constituting the main army, were\narmed with bows and arrows, spears and knives.  Of these a large force\nwas told off to remain behind and guard the village.\n\nThis home-guard was placed under command of the king in person.  The\nhundred musketeers were placed under Peterkin's command.  The other\nfifty were given to me, along with a hundred spear and bow men.  Jack\nhimself took command of the main body of spearmen.  As Peterkin had to\nact a special and independent part, besides commanding his hundred\nmusketeers, Makarooroo was made over to him, to act as lieutenant.\n\nAll these arrangements and appointments were made in a cool, quiet, and\narbitrary manner by Jack, to whom the natives, including the king,\nlooked up with a species of awe amounting almost to veneration.\n\n\"Now,\" said our commander-in-chief to Lieutenant Mak, \"tell the niggers\nI am going to make them a speech,\" (this was received with a grunt of\nsatisfaction), \"and that if they wish to have the smallest chance of\novercoming their enemies, they had better give their closest attention\nto what I have to say.\"\n\nAnother grunt of acquiescence followed this announcement.\n\n\"Say that I am going to speak to them of things so mysterious that they\nshall not by any conceivable or possible effort understand them.\"\n\nThis being quite in accordance with the superstitions and tastes of the\nnegroes, was received with eager acclamations of delight.\n\n\"Tell them,\" continued Jack, in a deep, solemn tone, and frowning\ndarkly, \"that we shall gain the victory _only_ through _obedience_.\nEach man must keep his ears open and his eye on his leader, and must\nobey orders _at once_.  If the order `Halt' should be given, and any man\nshould have his mouth open at the time, he must _keep_ his mouth open,\nand shut it _after_ he has halted.\"\n\nHere Jack took occasion to revert to the three orders, \"Forward,\"\n\"Halt,\" and \"Fire,\" and repeated the lesson several times, until his men\nwere quite perfect.  Then he put the various bodies under their\nrespective commanders, and telling the musketeers to make believe to\nfire (but making sure that they should not really do it, by taking their\nguns from them), he made each of us give the various words separately,\nso that our men should become familiar with our voices.\n\nThis done, he called the generals of divisions to him, and said--\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, I am going to review my troops, and to give them their\nfinal lesson in military tactics, with the double view of seeing that\nthey know what they have got to do, and of impressing them with a due\nsense of the great advantage of even a slight knowledge of drill.\"\n\nHe then directed us to take command of our several companies (Makarooroo\nbeing placed on this occasion over the king's band), and pointed out the\nseparate directions in which we were ultimately to post our troops, so\nas to advance upon the spot on which the king stood when the signal\nshould be given.  We had already taught the men the necessity of\nattacking in a compact single line, and of forming up into this position\nfrom what is termed Indian file, with which latter they were already\nacquainted.  Of course we could not hope to teach them the principles of\nwheeling in the short time at our command.  To overcome this difficulty,\nwe told each band to follow its leader, who should walk in front; to\nadvance when he advanced, to retire when he retired, and to turn this\nway or that way, according to his movements.\n\nAt a signal we gave the word \"Forward!\" and the whole band defiled into\nthe woods before the king, and disappeared like a vision, to the\nunutterable amazement of his majesty, who stood perfectly motionless,\nwith eyes and mouth open to their fullest extent.\n\nHaving marched together for some distance, each leader detached his men\nand led them, as it were, to opposite directions of the compass, three\nof the bands making a considerable detour, in order to get the spot\nwhere the king stood in the centre of us.  Then we halted and awaited\nthe next signal.  In about ten minutes it was given--a loud whistle--and\nwe gave the word \"Forward\" again.  I say \"we,\" because the result proved\nthat we had done so.  Being out of sight of the other bands, of course I\ncould not see how they acted.\n\nOn I rushed over brake and bush and morass, my men following me in a\nvery good line, considering the nature of the ground.  I had divided\nthem into four lines, with an interval of about six yards between each.\nAnd it was really wonderful how well they kept in that position.  The\nother companies had been ordered to act in the same way.\n\nOn bursting out of the woods I saw that we had outstripped the other\ncompanies, so I held my men in check by running somewhat slower; and\nthey had been so deeply impressed with the fatal consequences of not\ndoing exactly as I did, that they stared at me with all their eyes, to\nthe no small risk of their lives; for one or two dashed against trees,\nand others tumbled head over heels into holes, in their anxiety to keep\ntheir eyes upon me.\n\nIn a few seconds I observed Peterkin spring out of the woods, followed\nby his men, so I went on again at full speed.  As we entered the\nvillage, our ranks were sadly broken and confused by the huts; but on\ngaining the open space where Jack stood, I was pleased to observe that\nthe negroes tried, of their own accord, to regain their original\nformation, and succeeded so well that we came on in four tolerably\nstraight and compact lines.  Each commander having been forewarned to\nhold his men in check, or to push forward, so as to arrive at the\ncentral point at the same moment, Jack, Peterkin, Makarooroo, and I ran\nin upon the king together, and unitedly gave the word \"Halt!\" whereupon\nwe found ourselves in the centre of a solid square.\n\nSo deeply had the men been impressed with the necessity of obedience\nthat they had scarcely observed each other's approach.  They now stood\nrooted to the ground in every possible attitude of suddenly-arrested\nmotion, and all with their eyes and mouths wide open.  In another moment\nthe result of their combined movement became evident to them, and they\nuttered a yell of delighted surprise.\n\n\"Very good, very good indeed,\" said Jack; \"and that concluding yell was\nvery effective--quite magnificent.--But you see,\" he added, turning to\nme, \"although such a yell is sufficiently appalling to us, it will no\ndoubt be a mere trifle to men who are used to it.  What say you to\nteaching them a British cheer?\"\n\n\"Absurd,\" said I; \"they will never learn to give it properly.\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" rejoined Jack, in a doubtful manner.\n\n\"Try,\" said Peterkin.\n\n\"So I will.--Mak, tell them now that I'm going to continue the speech\nwhich this little review interrupted.\"\n\n\"They's all ready for more, massa.\"\n\nThis was patent to the meanest capacity; for the negroes stood gazing at\ntheir commander-in-chief with eyes and mouths and ears open, and\nnostrils expanded, as if anxious to gulp in and swallow down his words\nthrough every organ.\n\n\"There is a cry,\" said Jack, \"which the white man gives when he enters\ninto battle--a terrible cry, which is quite different from that of the\nblack man, and which is so awful that it strikes terror into the heart\nof the white man's enemies, and has even been known to make a whole army\nfly almost without a shot being fired.  We shall let you hear it.\"\n\nThereupon Jack and I and Peterkin gave utterance to a cheer of the most\nvociferous description, which evidently filled the minds of the natives\nwith admiration.\n\n\"Now,\" resumed Jack, \"I wish my black warriors to try that cheer--\"\n\nSome of the black warriors, supposing that the expression of this wish\nwas a direct invitation to them to begin, gave utterance to a terrific\nhowl.\n\n\"Stay! stop!\" cried Jack, holding up his hand.\n\nEvery mouth was closed instantly.\n\n\"You must cheer by command.  I will say `Hip, hip, hip!' three times; as\nsoon as I say the third `hip,' out with the cry.  Now then.  Hip, hip--\"\n\n\"'Popotamus,\" whispered Peterkin.\n\n\"Hip, hurrah!\" shouted Jack.\n\n\"Hurl! ho! sh! kee! how!\" yelled the savages, each man giving his own\nidea of our terror-inspiring British cheer.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Jack quietly; \"it is quite evident that the war-cry\nof the white man is not suited to the throat of the black.  You will\nutter your usual shout, my friends, when the signal is given; but\n_remember_, not before that.\n\n\"And now I come to the greatest mystery of all.\"  (Every ear was eagerly\nattentive.) \"The shot and bits of metal and little stones with which\nKing Jambai's warriors are accustomed to kill will not do on this great\nand peculiar occasion.  They will not answer the purpose--my purpose;\ntherefore I have provided a kind of bullet which every one must use\ninstead of his usual shot.  No warriors ever used such bullets in the\nfight before.  They are very precious, because I have only enough of\nthem to give one to each man.  But that will do.  If the enemy does not\nfly at the first discharge, then you may load with your own shot.\"\n\nSo saying, Jack, with the utmost gravity, took from the pouch that hung\nat his side a handful of little balls of paper about the size of a\nmusket bullet, which he began to distribute among the savages.  We had\nobserved Jack making several hundreds of these, the night previous to\nthis memorable day, out of one or two newspapers we had carried along\nwith us for wadding; but he would not at that time tell us what he was\ngoing to do with them.  The negroes received this novel species of\nammunition with deep interest and surprise.  Never having seen printed\npaper before, or, in all probability, paper of any kind, they were much\ntaken up with the mysterious characters imprinted thereon, and no doubt\nregarded these as the cause of the supernatural power which the bullets\nwere supposed to possess.\n\n\"Remember,\" said Jack, \"when these are discharged at the enemy, I do not\nsay that they will kill, but I do say that they will cause the enemy to\nfly.  Only, be assured that everything depends on your _obedience_.  And\nif one single stone, or nail, or hard substance is put in along with\nthese bullets, the chief part of my plans will be frustrated.\"\n\nIt was quite evident, from the expression of their sable countenances,\nthat the idea of the bullets not killing was anything but agreeable.\nThey were too deeply impressed, however, with Jack's power, and too far\ncommitted in the enterprise, and generally too much overwhelmed with\nmingled surprise and perplexity, to offer any objection.\n\n\"Now,\" said Jack in conclusion, \"you may go and eat well.  To-night,\nwhen it grows dark, hold yourselves in readiness to go forth in _dead\nsilence_.  Mind that: not a sound to be uttered until the signal, `Hip,\nhip, hip!' is given.\"\n\n\"And,\" added Peterkin, in an undertone to Makarooroo, \"tell them that\nKing Jambai expects that every man will do his duty.\"\n\nThis remark was received with a shout and a frightful display of white\nteeth, accompanied by a tremendous flourish of guns, bows, and spears.\n\nThere was something quite awful, not to say picturesque, in this\ndisplaying of teeth, which took place many times during the course of\nthe above proceedings.  You looked upon a sea of black ebony balls, each\nhaving two white dots with black centres near the top of it.  Suddenly\nthe ebony balls were gashed across, and a sort of storm, as it were, of\ndeep red mingled with pure white swept over the dark cloud of heads\nbefore you, and vanished as quickly as it had appeared, only to\nreappear, however, at the next stroke of humour, or at some \"touch of\nthat nature\" which is said on very high authority, to \"make the whole\nworld kin.\"\n\nThe proceedings eventually closed with a brief speech from the king, who\nreferred to Peterkin's remark about each man doing his duty, and said\nthat, \"if each man did _not_ do his duty--\" Here his majesty paused for\na minute, and wrought his countenance into horrible contortions,\nindicative of the most excruciating agony, and wound up with an emphatic\nrepetition of that dire threat about the unnatural treatment of eyes,\nheart, liver, and carcass, which had on the previous evening sounded so\nawful in our ears, and had been treated with such profound indifference\nby those whom it was specially designed to affect.\n\n\"I didn't know, Jack,\" observed Peterkin gravely, as we returned to our\nhut, \"that you were such an out-and-out humbug.\"\n\n\"You are severe, Peterkin.  I scarcely deserve to be called a humbug for\nacting to the best of my judgment in peculiar circumstances.\"\n\n\"Peculiar circumstances!\" responded Peterkin.  \"Truly they have received\npeculiar treatment!\"\n\n\"That is as it should be,\" rejoined Jack; \"at any rate, be they peculiar\nor be they otherwise, our plans are settled and our mode of action\nfixed, so we must e'en abide the issue.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\n\nA WARLIKE EXPEDITION AND A VICTORY.\n\nIt was excessively dark that night when we set forth on our expedition.\n\nThe scout from whom we had already ascertained so much about the\nintended movements of the enemy also told us that they meant to set out\nat a little before midnight and march on the village by a certain route.\nIndeed, it was very unlikely that they would approach by any other, as\nthe jungle elsewhere was so thick as to render marching, especially at\nnight, very difficult.\n\nJack therefore resolved to place the greater proportion of his troops in\nambush at the mouth of a small gully or dell a few miles from the\nenemy's camp, where they were almost certain to pass.  But with a degree\nof caution that I thought highly creditable in so young and\ninexperienced a general, he sent out a considerable number of the most\ntrustworthy men in advance, with instructions to proceed with the\nstealth of leopards, and to bring back instant information of any change\nof route on the part of the foe.\n\nThe troops placed in ambush at the dell above referred to were\nPeterkin's hundred musketeers, supported by Jack's spear and bow men.  I\nwas ordered to advance by a circuitous route on the camp itself with my\nfifty musketeers, followed by my small company of spearmen.  My\ninstructions were, to conceal my men as near to the camp as possible,\nand there await the first discharge of firearms from the dell, when I\nwas to rise, advance upon the camp, utter a terrific shout when within\nfifty yards, rush forward to within twenty-five yards, halt, pour in one\nwithering volley of blank cartridge, and charge without giving my men\ntime to load.\n\nOf course I could not speak to my men; but this was a matter of little\nconsequence, as they were now well acquainted with our three words of\ncommand, \"Forward,\" \"Halt,\" and \"Fire,\" and fully understood that they\nmust under all circumstances follow their leader.  I knew well enough\nthat there must be no little danger in this arrangement, because the\nleader would necessarily be always in front of the muzzles of the loaded\nguns.  But there was no help for it, so I resolved to act upon my usual\nprinciple--namely, that when a thing is inevitable, the best thing to do\nis to treat it as being unavoidable.\n\nHaving conducted my men stealthily and successfully to the vicinity of\nthe enemy's camp, though with some difficulty, owing to the almost\nimpenetrable nature of the jungle through which we had to pass in making\nthe detour necessary to avoid falling in with the attacking force, we\nproceeded to advance to within as short a distance of it as possible\nwithout running the risk of being discovered.  This was not difficult,\nfor the men left to guard the camp, supposing, no doubt, that their\npresence in that part of the country was not suspected, had taken no\nprecautions in the way of placing sentries; so we quickly arrived at the\nfoot of a small mound about sixty yards or so from the encampment.  At\nthe foot of this mound I caused my men to lie down, giving them to\nunderstand, by signs, that they were on no account to move until I\nshould return.  Then I crept alone to the brow of the mound, and\nobtained a clear view of the camp.\n\nThe men who should have guarded it were, I found, busily employed in\ncooking their supper.  There were, perhaps, upwards of a hundred of\nthem.  To my great satisfaction, I observed the captives sitting near to\nthe fire; and although at so considerable a distance from them, I felt\ncertain that I recognised the figures of Mbango and Okandaga.  Hastening\nback to my men, I endeavoured to give them as much information as\npossible by means of signs, and then lay down beside them to await the\nsignal from Jack's party.\n\nAlthough the attack of both our parties was to be simultaneous, the\nfirst shot was to be fired by our troops in the dell.  I will therefore\ndescribe their part of the engagement first.  Jack described it to me\nminutely after all was over.\n\nOn reaching the dell Jack disposed his forces so as to command the only\napproach to it.  The hundred musketeers he placed in a double row\ndirectly across the deepest and darkest part.  The spearmen he divided\ninto two bodies, which he posted on the flanks of the musketeers among\nthe bushes.  He then showed the rear rank of the latter how to point\ntheir pieces over the shoulders of the men in the front rank at a given\nsignal, but carefully reiterated the order not to touch a trigger until\nthe word \"Fire\" should be given.\n\n\"Now, Peterkin,\" said Jack, when these dispositions had been made, \"it\nis time for you to get ready.  Makarooroo and I can manage these\nfellows, so you have my permission to go and play your own independent\npart.  Only let me warn you to remember your last exploit in this way,\nand see that you don't do yourself a damage.\"\n\n\"Thanks, noble general, for the permission,\" answered Peterkin, \"of\nwhich I shall avail myself.  In reference to your advice, I may remark\nthat it is exceedingly valuable--so much so, indeed, that I would advise\nyou not to part with it until asked for.\"\n\nWith that Peterkin ran into the jungle, and was soon lost to view.\n\nOn gaining a sufficient distance from the men, he took off the greater\npart of his clothes, and wound round his person several pieces of\nlight-coloured cotton that he chanced to have with him, and some pieces\nof old newspaper.  Then he decked his head with leaves and ragged\nbranches, as he had done before in the haunted cave, making himself, in\nshort, as wild and fantastic a looking creature as possible--the only\ndifference between his getting-up on this and the former occasion being\nthat he was white instead of black.  For he wisely judged that a white\ndemon must naturally appear infinitely more appalling and horrible to a\nnegro than one of his own colour.\n\nThe two cones of moistened powder, however, which he had prepared for\nthis occasion, were very much larger than the former, and had been\nfitted into two wooden handles, or cups, for safety.  With these in his\nhands, he crept to the top of a steep, sloping mound or hill near the\nentrance to the dell, and considerably in advance of the troops.  Here\nhe sat down to await the approach of the enemy.\n\nThere is something very eerie and awe-inspiring in a solitary\nnight-watch, especially if it be kept in a wild, lonesome place.\nPeterkin afterwards told me that, while sitting that night on the top of\nthe mound, looking out upon a plain, over which the enemy were expected\nto approach, on the one hand, and down into the dark dell where our\ntroops were posted, on the other hand, his heart more than once misgave\nhim; and he could not help asking himself the questions, \"What if our\nplans miscarry?  What if our united volley and cheer, and my demoniac\ndisplay, should fail to intimidate the negroes?\"  Such questions he did\nnot like to dwell upon, for he knew that in the event of failure a\nregular pitched battle would be fought, and much blood would certainly\nflow.\n\nWhile indulging in such thoughts, he observed a dark form glide past the\nfoot of the mound on which he lay, and vanish in the obscurity of the\ndell, which was so surrounded by crags and rocky places covered with\nunderwood that no light could penetrate into it.  At first he was\nstartled, and thought of giving the alarm to his comrades; but on second\nthoughts he concluded the person must have been one of his own scouts\nreturned with news; at all events, he felt that one man could do no harm\nworth speaking of to so large a party.\n\nPresently he observed a large band of men coming over the plain towards\nthe entrance of the dell.  These, he felt assured, must be the enemy;\nand he was right.  They came on in a large, compact body, and were\nwell-armed; yet, from the quick and unguarded manner of their approach,\nhe could perceive that they suspected no ambush.\n\nThey entered the dell in a confused though solid and silent body; and\nPeterkin could observe, by the dim light, that they were led by one man,\nwho walked in advance, whom he rightly judged to be the Portuguese\nslave-dealer.\n\nThe time for action had now come.  He examined the points of his\npowder-cones, to ascertain that they were dry, then held a match in\nreadiness, and listened intently to the footsteps of the foe.\n\nI have already explained that Jack had drawn his musketeers across the\ndell, and placed the spearmen in the jungle on both flanks.  They were\narranged in such a way as to form three sides of a square, into which\nthe unsuspecting enemy now marched.  Jack allowed them to approach to\nwithin thirty paces of his musketeers, and then gave, in a loud, deep,\nsonorous tone, the word--\"Hip! hip! hip!\"\n\nThe compound cheer and yell that instantly followed the last hip was so\ntremendous, coming, as it did, from all sides except the rear, that the\nenemy were absolutely paralysed.  They stood rooted to the earth, as\nmotionless as if they had been transformed into stone.\n\nJack raised his hand, in which he held a bunch of white grass that could\nbe distinctly seen in the dark.\n\nEvery muzzle was pointed on the instant, but not a sound was heard save\nthe click of a hundred locks.\n\nThe sound was familiar to the enemy, although never before heard at one\nmoment in such numbers.  They started; but before a step could be taken,\nthe word \"Fire\" was given.\n\nInstantly a sheet of flame swept across the entire dell, and the united\ncrash of a hundred guns seemed to rend the very earth.  The surrounding\ncliffs reverberated and multiplied the horrid din, while, led by Jack,\ncheer followed cheer, or rather howls and yells filled the air, and kept\nawake the echoes of the place.\n\nThe enemy turned and fled, and the shrieks to which they gave utterance\nas they ran betokened the extremity of their terror.  It wanted but one\ntouch to complete their consternation, and that touch was given when\nPeterkin, lighting his powder-cones, showed himself on the mound,\ndancing in a blaze of fire, and shrieking furiously as the horrified\ntide of men swept by.\n\nIn the midst of his wild orgies, Peterkin acted an impromptu and\nunintentional part by tripping over the brow of the hill, and rolling\ndown the steep declivity like a fire-wheel into the very midst of the\nflying crew.  Jumping hastily up, he charged through the ranks of the\nfoe, flung the two hissing cones high into the air, and darting into the\njungle, hid himself effectually from view.\n\nMeanwhile Jack still held the bunch of white straw aloft.  Every eye was\nfixed on it, but not a man moved, because it remained stationary.  This\nabsence of pursuit in the midst of such appalling sights and sounds\nmust, undoubtedly, have added to the mystery and therefore to the\nterrors of the scene.\n\nSuddenly the white bunch was seen to dart forward.  Jack, who now\nconsidered the enemy almost beyond the chance of being overtaken, gave\nthe word, \"Forward!\" in the voice of a Stentor, following it up with\n\"Hip, hip, hurrah!\" and the whole host, musketeers and spearmen in a\nmingled mass, rushed yelling out upon the plain, and gave chase to the\nfoe.\n\n\"Not so badly done,\" said Jack, with a quiet laugh, as he laid his hand\non Peterkin's shoulder.\n\n\"Why, Jack, how did you find me out?\"\n\n\"Easily enough, when it is considered that I saw you go in.  The flame\nof your wild-fire indicated your movements pretty plainly to me,\nalthough terror and amazement no doubt blinded the eyes of every one\nelse.  Even Mak's teeth began to chatter when he saw you perform that\nsingular descent of the hill, and no wonder.  I hope no bones have been\nbroken?\"\n\n\"No; all right as far as that goes,\" replied Peterkin within a laugh;\n\"but I've lost a good deal of skin.  However, it'll grow again.  I'm\nglad it's no worse.  But I say, Jack, do you think our fellows won't\novertake these rascals?\"\n\n\"No fear of that.  I took care to give them a good start, and if there\nbe any truth in the generally received idea that terror lends wings, I'm\npretty sure that each man in the enemy's ranks must have obtained the\nloan of several pairs to-night.  But have you heard the sound of Ralph's\nguns?\"\n\n\"No; the din here was enough to drown anything so distant.\"\n\n\"Well, we must away to him as fast as we can.  I expect that poor Mak is\noff before us.\"\n\n\"But you'll wait until I put on my clothes?\" said Peterkin, hasting back\ntowards the place where he had undressed.\n\n\"Certainly, lad; only look alive.\"\n\nSoon afterwards they left the place together.\n\nWhile this was going on at the dell, I, on hearing the first shot, gave\nthe word \"Forward!\" in a low tone.  My men instantly rose and followed\nme, and I could not, even at that anxious moment, help admiring the\nserpent-like facility with which they glided from bush to bush, without\nthe slightest noise.  We descended a hill, crossed a small brook, and\napproached to within thirty yards of the camp without being discovered.\n\nSuddenly I leaped on the top of a hillock, and shouted at the utmost\npitch of my voice the single word \"Halt!\"\n\nOn hearing it all the men in the camp sprang to their arms, and stood\ngazing round them with looks of consternation.\n\nMy next word was, \"Fire!\"\n\nA firm, tremendous crash burst from among the bushes, and my single\nperson, enveloped in smoke and flame, was, I believe, the only object\nvisible to those in the camp.\n\n\"Hip, hip, hip, hurrah! forward!\"  I shouted; and with a ferocious yell\nwe poured like a whirlwind upon the foe.\n\nThe same result that had occurred at the dell took place here.  The\nenemy never awaited our charge.  They fled instantly, and so great was\ntheir terror that they actually threw down their arms, in order to\nfacilitate their flight.\n\nOn gaining the camp, however, I found, to my sorrow, that we had done\nthe thing only too vigorously; for we had not only put the enemy to\nflight, but we had also frightened away those whom we had come to\ndeliver!\n\nAt this point in the engagement I came to learn how incompetent I was to\ncommand men in cases of emergency, for here my presence of mind utterly\nforsook me.  In my anxiety to capture Mbango and his friends I ordered\nan immediate pursuit.  Then it occurred to me that, in the event of my\nmen being successful in overtaking the fugitives, they would instantly\nmurder them all, so I tried to call them back; but, alas! they did not\nunderstand my words, and they were by this time so excited as to be\nbeyond all restraint.  In a few minutes I found myself left alone in the\nenemy's camp, and heard the shouts of pursued and pursuers growing\ngradually fainter and more distant, as they scattered themselves through\nthe jungle.\n\nSeating myself by the fire in a state of mind bordering on despair, I\nburied my face in my hands, and endeavoured to collect myself, and\nconsider what, under the circumstances, should be now done.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\n\nARRANGEMENTS FOR PURSUING THE ENEMY, AND SUDDEN CHANGE OF PLANS.\n\n\"You seem to be taking it easy, old boy,\" said a voice close to my\nelbow.\n\nI started, and looked up hastily.\n\n\"Ah!  Peterkin.  You there?\"\n\n\"Ay; and may I not reply, with some surprise, _you here_?\"\n\n\"Truly you may,--but what could I do?  The men ran away from me, whether\nI would or no; and you are aware I could not make myself understood, not\nbeing able to--But where is Jack?\"\n\nI asked this abruptly, because it occurred to me at that moment that he\nand Peterkin should have been together.\n\n\"Where is Jack?\" echoed Peterkin; \"I may ask that of you, for I am\nignorant on the point.  He and I got separated in endeavouring to escape\nfrom the scrimmage caused by your valiant attack.  You seem to have\nscattered the whole force to the winds.  Oh, here he is, and Mak along\nwith him.\"\n\nJack and our guide came running into the camp at that moment.\n\n\"Well, Ralph, what of Okandaga?\"\n\n\"Ah! what of her indeed?\" said Peterkin.  \"I forgot her.  You don't moan\nto say she was not in the camp?\"\n\n\"Indeed she was,\" said I, \"and so were Mbango, and his wife Njamie, and\none or two others whom I did not know; but my men went at them with such\nferocity that they fled along with our enemies.\"\n\n\"Fled!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"Ay; and I fear much that it will fare ill with them if they are\novertaken, for the men were wild with excitement and passion.\"\n\n\"Come, this must be looked to,\" cried Jack, seizing his rifle and\ntightening his belt; \"we must follow, for if they escape our hands they\nwill certainly be retaken by their former captors.\"\n\nWe followed our comrade, without further remark, in the direction of the\nfugitives; but although we ran fast and long, we failed to come up with\nthem.  For two hours did we dash through bush and brake, jungle and\nmorass, led by Makarooroo, and lighted by the pale beams of the moon.\nThen we came to a halt, and sat down to consult.\n\n\"Dem be gone,\" said our wretched guide, whose cup of happiness was thus\ndashed from his hand just as he was about to raise it to his lips.\n\n\"Now, don't look so dismal, Mak,\" cried Peterkin, slapping the man on\nthe shoulder.  \"You may depend upon it, we will hunt her up somehow or\nother.  Only let us keep stout hearts, and we can do anything.\"\n\n\"Very easily said, Master Peterkin,\" observed Jack; \"but what course do\nyou propose we should follow just now?\"\n\n\"Collect our scattered men; go back to the village; have a palaver with\nKing Jambai and his chiefs; get up a pursuit, and run the foxes to\nearth.\"\n\n\"And suppose,\" said Jack, \"that you don't know in which direction they\nhave fled, how can we pursue them?\"\n\n\"It is very easy to suppose all manner of difficulties,\" retorted\nPeterkin.  \"If you have a better plan, out with it.\"\n\n\"I have no better plan, but I have a slight addition to make to yours,\nwhich is, that when we collect a few of our men, I shall send them out\nto every point of the compass, to make tracks like the spokes of a\nwheel, of which the village shall be the centre; and by that means we\nshall be pretty certain to get information ere long as to the\nwhereabouts of our fugitives.  So now let us be up and doing; time is\nprecious to-night.\"\n\nIn accordance with this plan, we rapidly retraced our steps to the dell,\nwhich had been appointed as our place of rendezvous.  Here we found the\ngreater part of our men assembled; and so well-timed had Jack's\nmovements been, that not one of them all had been able to overtake or\nslay a single enemy.  Thus, by able generalship, had Jack gained a\ncomplete and bloodless victory.\n\nHaving detached and sent off our scouts--who, besides being picked men,\ntravelled without any other encumbrance than their arms--we resumed our\njourney homeward, and reached the village not long after sunrise, to the\nimmense surprise of Jambai, who could scarcely believe that we had\nrouted the enemy so completely, and whose scepticism was further\nincreased by the total, and to him unaccountable, absence of prisoners,\nor of any other trophies of our success in the fight.  But Jack made a\npublic speech, of such an elaborate, deeply mysterious, and totally\nincomprehensible character, that even Makarooroo, who translated,\nlistened and spoke with the deepest reverence and wonder; and when he\nhad concluded, there was evidently a firm impression on the minds of the\nnatives that this victory was--by some means or in some way or other\nquite inexplicable but highly satisfactory--the greatest they had ever\nachieved.\n\nThe king at once agreed to Jack's proposal that a grand pursuit should\ntake place, to commence the instant news should be brought in by the\nscouts.  But the news, when it did come, had the effect of totally\naltering our plans.\n\nThe first scout who returned told us that he had fallen in with a large\nbody of the enemy encamped on the margin of a small pond.  Creeping like\na snake through the grass, he succeeded in getting near enough to\noverhear the conversation, from which he gathered two important pieces\nof information--namely, that they meant to return to their own lands in\na north-easterly direction, and that their prisoners had escaped by\nmeans of a canoe which they found on the banks of the river that flowed\npast King Jambai's village.\n\nThe first piece of information decided the king to assemble his\nfollowers, and go off in pursuit of them at once; the second piece of\nnews determined us to obtain a canoe and follow Mbango and his\ncompanions to the sea-coast, whither, from all that we heard, we\nconcluded they must certainly have gone.  As this, however, was a\njourney of many weeks, we had to take the matter into serious\nconsideration.\n\n\"It is quite evident,\" said Jack, as we sat over our supper on the night\nafter receiving the above news--\"it is quite evident that they mean to\ngo to the coast, for Mbango had often expressed to Mak a wish to go\nthere; and the mere fact of their having been seen to escape and take\ndown stream, is in itself pretty strong evidence that they did not mean\nto return to their now desolated village, seeing that the country behind\nthem is swarming with enemies; and of course they cannot know that we\nhave conquered the main body of these rascals.  I therefore propose that\nwe should procure a canoe and follow them: first, because we must at all\nhazards get hold of poor Okandaga, and relieve the anxiety of our\nfaithful guide Makarooroo; and second, because it is just as well to go\nin that direction as in any other, in order to meet with wild animals,\nand see the wonders of this land.\"\n\n\"But what if King Jambai takes it into his black woolly head to decline\nto let us go?\" said Peterkin.\n\n\"In that case we must take French leave of him.\"\n\n\"In which case,\" said I, in some alarm, \"all my specimens of natural\nhistory will be lost.\"\n\nJack received this remark with a shake of his head and a look of great\nperplexity; and Peterkin said, \"Ah, Ralph, I fear there's no help for\nit.  You must make up your mind to say good-bye to your mummies--big\npuggies and all.\"\n\n\"But you do not know,\" said I energetically, \"that Jambai will detain us\nagainst our will.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Jack; \"and for your sake I hope that he will\nnot.  At any rate I will go to see him about this point after supper.\nIt's of no use presenting a petition either to king, lord, or common\nwhile his stomach is empty.  But there is another thing that perplexes\nme: that poor sick child, Njamie's son, must not be left behind.  The\npoor distracted mother has no doubt given him up for lost.  It will be\nlike getting him back from the grave.\"\n\n\"True,\" said I; \"we must take him with us.  Yet I fear he is too ill to\ntravel, and we cannot await his recovery.\"\n\n\"He is not so ill as he seemed,\" observed Peterkin.  \"I went to see him\nonly half an hour ago, and the little chap was quite hearty, and glad to\nsee me.  The fact is, he has been ill-used and ill-fed.  The rest and\ngood treatment he has received have, even in the short time he has been\nhere, quite revived him.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Jack; \"then he shall go with us.  I'll engage to take him\non my back when he knocks up on the march--for we have a march before\nus, as I shall presently explain--and when we get into a canoe he will\nbe able to rest.\"\n\n\"But what march do you refer to?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Simply this.  Mak, with whom I have had a good deal of conversation on\nthe subject, tells me that the river makes a considerable bend below\nthis village, and that by taking a short cut of a day's journey or so\nover land we can save time, and will reach a small hamlet where canoes\nare to be had.  The way, to be sure, is through rather a wild country;\nbut that to us is an advantage, as we shall be the more likely to meet\nwith game.  I find, also, that the king has determined to follow the\nsame route with his warriors in pursuit of the enemy, so that thus far\nwe may travel together.  At the hamlet we will diverge to the\nnorth-east, while we, if all goes well, embarking in our canoe, will\nproceed toward the west coast, where, if we do not overtake them on the\nway, we shall be certain to find them on our arrival.  Okandaga has\noften longed to go to the mission station there, and as she knows it is\nin vain to urge Mbango to return to his destroyed village, she will\ndoubtless advise him to go to the coast.\"\n\n\"What you say seems highly probable,\" said I; \"and I think the best\nthing you can do is to go to the king at once and talk him over.\"\n\n\"Trust Jack for that,\" added Peterkin, who was at that moment deeply\nengaged with what he called the drumstick of a roast monkey.  \"Jack\nwould talk over any creature with life, so persuasive is his eloquence.\nI say, Ralph,\" he added, holding the half-picked drumstick at arm's\nlength, and regarding it with a critical gaze, \"I wonder, now, how the\ndrumstick of an ostrich would taste.  Good, I have no doubt, though\nrather large for one man's dinner.\"\n\n\"It would be almost equal to gorilla ham, I should fancy,\" said Jack, as\nhe left the hut on his errand to the king.\n\n\"O you cannibal, to think of such a thing!\" cried Peterkin, throwing the\nbone of his drumstick after our retreating comrade.--\"But 'tis always\nthus,\" he added, with a sigh: \"man preys upon man, monkey upon monkey.\nYet I had hoped better things of Jack.  I had believed him to be at\nleast a refined species of gorilla.  I say, Ralph, what makes you look\nso lugubrious?\"\n\n\"The difficulties, I suppose, that beset our path,\" said I sadly; for,\nto say truth, I did not feel in a jesting humour just then.  I was\nforced, however, in spite of myself, to laugh at the expression of\nmingled disgust and surprise that overspread the mobile countenance of\nmy friend on hearing my reply.\n\n\"`The difficulties,'\" echoed he, \"`that beset our path!'  Really, Ralph,\nlife will become insupportable to me if you and Jack go on in this\nfashion.  A man of nerve and sanguine temperament might stand it, but to\none like me, of a naturally timid and leaning nature, with the addition\nof low spirits, it is really crushing--quite crushing.\"\n\nI laughed, and replied that he must just submit to be crushed, as it was\nimpossible for Jack and me to change our dispositions to suit his\nconvenience; whereupon he sighed, lighted his pipe, and began to smoke\nvehemently.\n\nIn the course of little more than an hour Jack returned, accompanied by\nMakarooroo, and from the satisfied expression of their faces I judged\nthat they had been successful.\n\n\"Ah!  I see; it's all right,\" said Peterkin, raising himself on one\nelbow as they entered the hut and seated themselves beside the fire.\n\"Old Jambai has been `talked over.'\"\n\n\"Right; but he needed a deal of talk--he was horribly obstinate,\" said\nJack.\n\n\"Ho, yis; ho! ho! horribubly obsterlate,\" added Makarooroo in\ncorroboration, rubbing his hands and holding his nose slyly over the\nbowl of Peterkin's pipe, in order to enjoy, as it were, a second-hand\nwhiff.\n\n\"Here, there's a bit for yourself, old boy.  Sit down and enjoy yourself\nwhile Jack tells us all about his interview with royalty,\" said\nPeterkin, handing a lump of tobacco to our guide, whose eyes glistened\nand white teeth gleamed as he received the much-prized gift.\n\nJack now explained to us that he had found the king in a happy state of\nsatiety, smoking in his very curious and uneasy-looking easy-chair; that\nhe had at first begged and entreated him (Jack) to stay and take command\nof his warriors, and had followed up his entreaties with a hint that it\nwas just possible he might adopt stronger measures if entreaty failed.\n\nTo this Jack replied in a long speech, in which he pointed out the\nimpossibility of our complying with the king's request under present\ncircumstances, and the absolute necessity of our returning at some\nperiod or other to our native land to tell our people of the wonders we\nhad seen in the great country of King Jambai.  Observing that his\narguments did not make much impression on the king, he brought up his\nreserve force to the attack, and offered all the remainder of our goods\nas a free gift to his majesty, stipulating only that he (the king)\nshould, in consideration thereof, carefully send our boxes of specimens\ndown to the coast, where the messengers, on arriving, should be\nhandsomely paid if everything should arrive safely and in good order.\n\nThese liberal offers had a visible influence on the sable monarch, whose\npipe indicated the state of his mind pretty clearly--thin wreaths of\nsmoke issuing therefrom when he did not sympathise with Jack's\nreasoning, and thick voluminous clouds revolving about his woolly head,\nand involving him, as it were, in a veil of gauze, when he became\npleasantly impressed.  When Jack made mention of the valuable gifts\nabove referred to, his head and shoulders were indistinctly visible amid\nthe white cloudlets; and when he further offered to supply him with a\nfew hundreds of the magical paper balls that had so effectually defeated\nhis enemies the day before, the upper part of his person was obliterated\naltogether in smoke.\n\nThis last offer of Jack's we deemed a great stroke of politic wisdom,\nfor thereby he secured that the pending war should be marked by the\nshedding of less blood than is normal in such cases.  He endeavoured\nfurther to secure this end by assuring the king that the balls would be\nuseless for the purpose for which they were made if any other substance\nshould be put into the gun along with them, and that they would only\naccomplish the great end of putting the enemy to flight if fired at them\nin one tremendous volley at a time when the foe had no idea of the\npresence of an enemy.\n\nAll things being thus amicably arranged, we retired to rest, and slept\nsoundly until daybreak, when we were awakened by the busy sounds of\npreparation in the village for the intended pursuit.\n\nWe, too, made active arrangements for a start, and soon after were\ntrooping over the plains and through the jungle in the rear of King\nJambai's army, laden with such things as we required for our journey to\nthe coast, and Jack, besides his proportion of our food, bedding,\ncooking utensils, etcetera, carrying Njamie's little sick boy on his\nbroad shoulders.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\n\nWE MEET WITH A LUDICROUSLY AWFUL ADVENTURE.\n\nThe day following that on which we set out from King Jambai's village,\nas narrated in the last chapter, Jack, Peterkin, Makarooroo, Njamie's\nlittle boy, and I embarked in a small canoe, and bidding adieu to our\nhospitable friends, set out on our return journey to the coast.\n\nWe determined to proceed thither by another branch of the river which\nwould take us through a totally new, and in some respects different,\ncountry from that in which we had already travelled, and which, in the\ncourse of a few weeks, would carry us again into the neighbourhood of\nthe gorilla country.\n\nOne beautiful afternoon, about a week after parting from our friends, we\nmet with an adventure in which the serious and the comic were strangely\nmingled.  Feeling somewhat fatigued after a long spell at our paddles,\nand being anxious to procure a monkey or a deer, as we had run short of\nfood, we put ashore, and made our encampment on the banks of the river.\nThis done, we each sallied out in different directions, leaving\nMakarooroo in charge of the camp.\n\nFor some time I wandered about the woods in quest of game, but although\nI fired at many animals that were good for food, I missed them all, and\nwas unwillingly compelled to return empty-handed.  On my way back, and\nwhile yet several miles distant from the camp, I met Jack, who had\nseveral fat birds of the grouse species hanging at his girdle.\n\n\"I am glad to see that you have been more successful than I, Jack,\" said\nI, as we met.\n\n\"Yet I have not much to boast of,\" he replied.  \"It is to be hoped that\nPeterkin has had better luck.  Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"No; I have not even heard him fire a shot.\"\n\n\"Well, let us go on.  Doubtless he will make his appearance in good\ntime.  What say you to following the course of this brook?  I have no\ndoubt it will guide us to the vicinity of our camp, and the ground\nimmediately to the left of it seems pretty clear of jungle.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said I; and for the next ten minutes or so we walked beside\neach other in silence.  Suddenly our footsteps were arrested by a low\npeculiar noise.\n\n\"Hark! is that a human voice?\" whispered Jack, as he cocked his rifle.\n\n\"It sounds like it,\" said I.\n\nAt the same moment we heard some branches in an opposite direction\ncrack, as if they had been broken by a heavy tread.  Immediately after,\nthe first sound became louder and more distinct.  Jack looked at me in\nsurprise, and gradually a peculiar smile overspread his face.\n\n\"It's Peterkin,\" said I, in a low whisper.\n\nMy companion nodded, and half-cocking our pieces, we advanced with slow\nand cautious steps towards the spot whence the sound had come.  The\ngurgling noise of the brook prevented us from hearing as well as usual,\nso it was not until we were close upon the bushes that fringed the banks\nof the streamlet that we clearly discerned the tones of Peterkin's voice\nin conversation with some one, who, however, seemed to make no reply to\nhis remarks.  At first I thought he must be talking to himself, but in\nthis I was mistaken.\n\n\"Let's listen for a minute or two,\" whispered my companion, with a broad\ngrin.\n\nI nodded assent, and advancing cautiously, we peeped over the bushes.\nThe sight that met our eyes was so irresistibly comic that we could\nscarcely restrain our laughter.\n\nOn a soft grassy spot, close to the warbling stream, lay our friend\nPeterkin, on his breast, resting on his elbows, and the forefinger of\nhis right hand raised.  Before him, not more than six inches from his\nnose, sat the most gigantic frog I ever beheld, looking inordinately fat\nand intensely stupid.  My memory instantly flew back to the scene on the\ncoral island where Jack and I had caught our friend holding a quiet\nconversation with the old cat, and I laughed internally as I thought on\nthe proverb, \"The boy is the father of the man.\"\n\n\"Frog,\" said Peterkin, in a low, earnest voice, at the same time shaking\nhis finger slowly and fixing his eyes on the plethoric creature before\nhim--\"frog, you may believe it or not as you please, but I do solemnly\nassure you that I never did behold such a great, big, fat monster as you\nare in all--my--life!  What do you mean by it?\"\n\nAs the frog made no reply to this question, but merely kept up an\nincessant puffing motion in its throat, Peterkin continued--\n\n\"Now, frog, answer me this one question--and mind that you don't tell\nlies--you may not be aware of it, but you can't plead ignorance, for I\nnow tell you that it is exceedingly wicked to tell lies, whether you be\na frog or only a boy.  Now, tell me, did you ever read `Aesop's\nFables?'\"\n\nThe frog continued to puff, but otherwise took no notice of its\nquestioner.  I could not help fancying that it was beginning to look\nsulky at being thus catechised.\n\n\"What, you won't speak!  Well, I'll answer for you: you have _not_ read\n`Aesop's Fables;' if you had you would not go on blowing yourself up in\nthat way.  I'm only a little man, it's true--more's the pity--but if you\nimagine that by blowing and puffing like that you can ever come to blow\nup as big as me, you'll find yourself mistaken.  You can't do it, so you\nneedn't try.  You'll only give yourself rheumatism.  Now, _will_ you\nstop?  If you won't stop you'll burst--there.\"\n\nPeterkin paused here, and for some time continued to gaze intently in\nthe face of his new friend.  Presently he began again--\n\n\"Frog, what are you thinking of?  Do you ever think?  I don't believe\nyou do.  Tightened up as you seem to be with wind or fat or conceit, if\nyou were to attempt to think the effort would crack your skin, so you'd\nbetter not try.  But, after all, you've some good points about you.  If\nit were not that you would become vain I would tell you that you've got\na very good pair of bright eyes, and a pretty mottled skin, and that\nyou're at least the size of a big chicken--not a plucked but a\nfull-fledged chicken.  But, O frog, you've got a horribly ugly big\nmouth, and you're too fat--a great deal too fat for elegance; though I\nhave no doubt it's comfortable.  Most fat people are comfortable.  Oh!\nyou would, would you?\"\n\nThis last exclamation was caused by the frog making a lazy leap to one\nside, tumbling heavily over on its back, and rolling clumsily on to its\nlegs again, as if it wished to escape from its tormentor, but had\nscarcely vigour enough to make the effort.  Peterkin quietly lifted it\nup and placed it deliberately before him again in the same attitude as\nbefore.\n\n\"Don't try that again, old boy,\" said he, shaking his finger\nthreateningly and frowning severely, \"else I'll be obliged to give you a\npoke in the nose.  I wonder, now, Frog, if you ever had a mother, or if\nyou only grew out of the earth like a plant.  Tell me, were you ever\ndandled in a mother's arms?  Do you know anything of maternal affection,\neh?  Humph!  I suspect not.  You would not look so besottedly stupid if\nyou did.  I tell you what it is, old fellow: you're uncommonly bad\ncompany, and I've a good mind to ram my knife through you, and carry you\ninto camp to my friend Ralph Rover, who'll skin and stuff you to such an\nextent that your own mother wouldn't know you, and carry you to England,\nand place you in a museum under a glass case, to be gazed at by nurses,\nand stared at by children, and philosophised about by learned\nprofessors.  Hollo! none o' that now.  Come, poor beast; I didn't mean\nto frighten you.  There, sit still, and don't oblige me to stick you up\nagain, and I'll not take you to Ralph.\"\n\nThe poor frog, which had made another attempt to escape, gazed vacantly\nat Peterkin again without moving, except in regard to the puffing before\nreferred to.\n\n\"Now, frog, I'll have to bid you good afternoon.  I'm sorry that time\nand circumstance necessitate our separation, but I'm glad that I have\nhad the pleasure of meeting with you.  Glad and sorry, frog, in the same\nbreath!  Did you ever philosophise on that point, eh?  Is it possible,\nthink you, to be glad and sorry at one and the same moment?  No doubt a\ncreature like you, with such a very small intellect, if indeed you have\nany at all, will say that it is not possible.  But I know better.  Why,\nwhat do you call hysterics?  Ain't that laughing and crying at once--\nsorrow and joy mixed?  I don't believe you understand a word that I say.\nYou great puffing blockhead, what are you staring at?\"\n\nThe frog, as before, refused to make any reply; so our friend lay for\nsome time chuckling and making faces at it.  While thus engaged he\nhappened to look up, and to our surprise as well as alarm we observed\nthat he suddenly turned as pale as death.\n\nTo cock our rifles, and take a step forward so as to obtain a view in\nthe direction in which he was gazing with a fixed and horrified stare,\nwas our immediate impulse.  The object that met our eyes on clearing the\nbushes was indeed well calculated to strike terror into the stoutest\nheart; for there, not three yards distant from the spot on which our\nfriend lay, and partially concealed by foliage, stood a large black\nrhinoceros.  It seemed to have just approached at that moment, and had\nbeen suddenly arrested, if not surprised, by the vision of Peterkin and\nthe frog.  There was something inexpressibly horrible in the sight of\nthe great block of a head, with its mischievous-looking eyes, ungainly\nsnout, and ponderous horn, in such close proximity to our friend.  How\nit had got so near without its heavy tread being heard I cannot tell,\nunless it were that the noise of the turbulent brook had drowned the\nsound.\n\nBut we had no time either for speculation or contemplation.  Both Jack\nand I instantly took aim--he at the shoulder, as he afterwards told me;\nI at the monster's eye, into which, with, I am bound to confess, my\nusual precipitancy, I discharged both barrels.\n\nThe report seemed to have the effect of arousing Peterkin out of his\nstate of fascination, for he sprang up and darted towards us.  At the\nsame instant the wounded rhinoceros crossed the spot which he had left\nwith a terrific rush, and bursting through the bushes as if it had been\na great rock falling from a mountain cliff, went headlong into the\nrivulet.\n\nWithout moving from the spot on which we stood, we recharged our pieces\nwith a degree of celerity that, I am persuaded, we never before\nequalled.  Peterkin at the same time caught up his rifle, which leaned\nagainst a tree hard by, and only a few seconds elapsed after the fall of\nthe monster into the river ere we were upon its banks ready for another\nshot.\n\nThe portion of the bank of the stream at this spot happened to be rather\nsteep, so that the rhinoceros, on regaining his feet, experienced\nconsiderable difficulty in the attempts to clamber out, which he made\nrepeatedly and violently on seeing us emerge from among the bushes.\n\n\"Let us separate,\" said Jack; \"it will distract his attention.\"\n\n\"Stay; you have blown out his eye, Ralph, I do believe,\" said Peterkin.\n\nOn drawing near to the struggling monster we observed that this was\nreally the case.  Blood streamed from the eye into which I had fired,\nand poured down his hideous jaws, dyeing the water in which he\nfloundered.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried Jack, springing to the right, in order to get on the\nanimal's blind side as it succeeded in effecting a landing.\n\nPeterkin instantly sprang in the same direction, while I bounded to the\nopposite side.  I have never been able satisfactorily to decide in my\nown mind whether this act on my part was performed in consequence of a\nsudden, almost involuntary, idea that by so doing I should help to\ndistract the creature's attention, or was the result merely of an\naccidental impulse.  But whatever the cause, the effect was most\nfortunate; for the rhinoceros at once turned towards me, and thus, being\nblind in the other eye, lost sight of Jack and Peterkin, who with the\nrapidity almost of thought leaped close up to its side, and took close\naim at the most vulnerable parts of its body.  As they were directly\nopposite to me, I felt that I ran some risk of receiving their fire.\nBut before I had time either to reflect that they could not possibly\nmiss so large an object at so short a distance, or to get out of the\nway, the report of both their heavy rifles rang through the forest, and\nthe rhinoceros fell dead almost at my feet.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Peterkin, throwing his cap into the air at this happy\nconsummation, and sitting down on the haunch of our victim.\n\n\"Shame on you, Peterkin,\" said I, as I reloaded his rifle for\nhim--\"shame on you to crow thus over a fallen foe!\"\n\n\"Ha, boy! it's all very well for you to say that now, but you know well\nenough that you would rather have lost your ears than have missed such a\nchance as this.  But, I say, it'll puzzle you to stuff that fellow,\nwon't it?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" answered Jack, as he drew a percussion cap from his\npouch, and placed it carefully on the nipple of his rifle.  \"Ralph will\nnot find it easy; and it's a pity, too, not to take it home with us, for\nunder a glass case it would make such a pretty and appropriate\n_pendant_, in his museum, to that interesting frog with which you--\"\n\n\"Oh, you sneaking eavesdropper!\" cried Peterkin, laughing.  \"It is\nreally too bad that a fellow can't have a little _tete-a-tete_ with a\nfriend but you and Ralph must be thrusting your impertinent noses in the\nway.\"\n\n\"Not to mention the rhinoceros,\" observed Jack.\n\n\"Ah! to be sure--the rhinoceros; yes, I might have expected to find you\nin such low company, for `birds of a feather,' you know, are said to\n`flock together.'\"\n\n\"If there be any truth in that,\" said I, \"you are bound, on the same\nground, to identify yourself with the frog.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" cried Peterkin, starting up and looking around the spot on\nwhich his interesting _tete-a-tete_ had taken place, \"where is the frog?\nIt was just here that--Ah!--oh!--oh! poor, poor frog!\n\n  \"`Your course is run, your days are o'er;\n  We'll never have a chat no more,'\n\n\"As Shakespeare has it.  Well, well, who would have thought that so\nconversable and intelligent a creature should have come to such a\nmelancholy end?\"\n\nThe poor frog had indeed come to a sad and sudden end, and I felt quite\nsorry for it, although I could not help smiling at my companion's quaint\nmanner of announcing the fact.\n\nNot being gifted with the activity of Peterkin, it had stood its ground\nwhen the rhinoceros charged, and had received an accidental kick from\nthe great foot of that animal which had broken its back and killed it\noutright.\n\n\"There's one comfort, however,\" observed Jack, as we stood over the\nfrog's body: \"you have been saved the disagreeable necessity of killing\nit yourself, Ralph.\"\n\nThis was true, and I was not sorry that the rhinoceros had done me this\nservice; for, to say truth, I have ever felt the necessity of killing\nanimals in cold blood to be one of the few disagreeable points in the\notherwise delightful life of a naturalist.  To shoot animals in the heat\nand excitement of the chase I have never felt to be particularly\nrepulsive or difficult; but the spearing of an insect, or the deliberate\nkilling of an unresisting frog, are duties which I have ever performed\nwith a feeling of deep self-abhorrence.\n\nCarefully packing my frog in leaves, and placing it in my pouch, I\nturned with my companions to quit the scene of our late encounter and\nreturn to our camp, on arriving at which we purposed sending back\nMakarooroo to cut off the horn of the rhinoceros; for we agreed that, as\nit was impossible to carry away the entire carcass, we ought at least to\nsecure the horn as a memorial of our adventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\n\nWE SEE STRANGE THINGS, AND GIVE OUR NEGRO FRIENDS THE SLIP.\n\nDuring the two following days we passed through a country that was more\nthickly covered with the indiarubber vine than any place we had before\nmet with in our African travels.  I could not help feeling regret that\nsuch a splendid region should be almost, if not altogether, unknown and\nuseless to civilised man.  There seemed to be an unlimited supply of\ncaoutchouc; but the natives practised a method of gathering it which had\nthe effect of destroying the vine.\n\nOne day, some weeks after this, we came upon the habitation of a most\nremarkable species of monkey, named the Nshiego Mbouve, which we had\noften heard of, but had not up to that time been so fortunate as to see.\nBeing exceedingly anxious to observe how this remarkable creature made\nuse of its singular house, Peterkin and I lay down near the place, and\nsecreting ourselves in the bushes, patiently awaited the arrival of the\nmonkey, while Jack went off in another direction to procure something\nfor supper.\n\n\"I don't believe he'll come home to-night,\" said Peterkin, after we had\nlain down.  \"People never do come in when any one chances to be waiting\nfor them.  The human race seems to be born to disappointment.  Did you\nnever notice, Ralph, how obstinately contrary and cross-grained things\ngo when you want them to go otherwise?\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand you,\" said I.\n\n\"Of course you don't.  Yours seems to be a mind that can never take\nanything in unless it is hammered in by repetition.\"\n\n\"Come now, Peterkin, don't become, yourself, an illustration of your own\nremark in reference to cross-grained things.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't.  But seriously, Ralph, have you not observed, in the\ncourse of your observant life, that when you have particular business\nwith a man, and go to his house or office, you are _certain_ to find him\nout, to use the common phrase?  It would be more correct, however, to\nsay `you are certain not to find him in.'\"\n\n\"You are uncommonly particular, Peterkin.\"\n\n\"Truly I had need to be so, with such an uncommonly stupid audience.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  Well?\"\n\n\"Well, have you never observed that if you have occasion to call at a\nhouse where you have never been before, the number of that particular\nhouse is not in its usual place, and you find it after a search quite\naway from where it ought to be?  Has it never struck you that when you\ntake out your umbrella, the day is certain to become hot and sunny;\nwhile, if you omit to carry it with you, it is sure to rain?\"\n\n\"From all of which you conclude,\" said I, \"that the Nshiego will not\ncome home to-night?\"\n\n\"Exactly so; that is my meaning precisely.\"\n\nAfter Peterkin said this, we relapsed into silence; and it was well that\nwe did so, for had we continued our conversation even in the whispering\ntones in which it had up to that time been conducted, we should have\nfrightened away the ape which now came, as it were, to rebuke Peterkin\nfor his unbelief.\n\nComing quickly forward, the Nshiego Mbouve chambered quickly up the tree\nwhere its nest was built.  This nest was not a structure _into_ which it\nclambered, but a shelter or canopy formed of boughs with their leaves,\nsomewhat in shape like an umbrella, under which it sat.  The\nconstruction of this shelter exhibited a good deal of intelligent\ningenuity on the part of the ape; for it was tied to the tree by means\nof wild vines and creepers, and formed a neat, comfortable roof, that\nwas quite capable of shedding the night dews or heavy rains, and thus\nprotecting its occupant.\n\nWe were greatly amused by the manner in which the creature proceeded to\nmake itself comfortable.  Just below the canopy was a small branch which\njutted out horizontally from the stem of the tree.  On this branch the\nape seated itself, its feet and haunches resting thereon.  Then it threw\none arm round the tree, and hugging that lovingly to its side, gave what\nappeared to me to be a small sigh of satisfaction, and prepared to go to\nsleep.\n\nAt this Peterkin chuckled audibly.  The Nshiego's eyes opened at once.\nI cocked my gun and took aim.  The desire to procure a specimen was very\nstrong within me, but an unconquerable aversion to kill an animal in\nsuch cozy circumstances restrained me.  The Nshiego got up in alarm.  I\npointed the gun, but could not fire.  It began to descend.  I pulled the\ntrigger, and, I am happy to add, missed my aim altogether, to the\nintense delight of Peterkin, who filled the woods with laughter, while\nthe Nshiego Mbouve, dropping to the ground, ran shrieking from the spot.\n\nMy forbearance at this time was afterwards repaid by my obtaining two\nmuch finer specimens of this shelter-building ape, both of which were\nkilled by Peterkin.\n\nOn quitting this place we had a narrow escape, the recollection of which\nstill fills me with horror.  We were walking rapidly back towards our\nencampment, chatting as we went, when Peterkin suddenly put his foot on\nwhat appeared to be the dead branch of a tree.  No sooner had he done so\nthan the curling folds of a black snake fully ten feet long scattered\nthe dry leaves into the air, and caused us both to dart aside with a\nyell of terror.\n\nI have thought that in the complicated and wonderful mechanism of man\nthere lies a species of almost involuntary muscular power which enables\nhim to act in all cases of sudden danger with a degree of prompt\ncelerity that he could not possibly call forth by a direct act of\nvolition.  At all events, on the present emergency, without in the least\ndegree knowing what I was about, I brought my gun from my shoulder into\na horizontal position, and blew the snake's head off almost in an\ninstant.\n\nI have pondered this subject, and from the fact that while at one time a\nman may be prompt and courageous in case of sudden danger, at another\ntime the same man may become panic-stricken and helpless, I have come to\nthe conclusion that the all-wise Creator would teach us--even the\nbravest among us--the lesson of our dependence upon each other, as well\nas our dependence upon Himself, and would have us know that while at one\ntime we may prove a tower of strength and protection to our friends, at\nanother time our friends may have to afford succour and protection to\nus.\n\nI have often wondered, in reference to this, that many men seem to take\npride in bold independence, when it is an obvious fact that _every_ man\nis dependent on his fellow, and that this mutual dependence is one of\nthe chief sources of human happiness.\n\nThe black snake which I had killed turned out to be one of a very\nvenomous kind, whose bite is said to be fatal, so that we had good cause\nto be thankful, and to congratulate ourselves on our escape.\n\nIn this region of Africa we were particularly fortunate in what we saw\nand encountered, as the narrative of our experiences on the day\nfollowing the above incidents will show.\n\nWe had scarcely advanced a few miles on our journey on the morning of\nthat day, when we came upon a part of the country where the natives had\nconstructed a curious sort of trap for catching wild animals; and it\nhappened that a large band of natives were on the point of setting out\nfor a grand hunt at that time.\n\nWe were greeted with immense delight on our arrival, for those natives,\nwe soon discovered, had already heard of our exploits in the lands of\nthe gorilla, and regarded us as the greatest hunters that had ever been\nborn.  After a short conversation with the chief, through the medium of\nMakarooroo, we arranged to rest there a day, and accompany them on their\nhunting expedition; and the better to secure their good will, we\npresented some of the head men with a few of the beads which we still\npossessed.  Then hauling our canoe out of the water, we prepared\nourselves for the chase.\n\nAfter a long and tedious march through somewhat dense jungle, we came\nupon the ground, which was partly open, partly clothed with trees and\nshrubs.  Here the natives, who numbered several hundreds, spread\nthemselves out in a long semicircular line, in order to drive the game\ninto the trap.\n\nAs we followed them, or rather formed part of the line, I overheard the\nfollowing conversation between Peterkin and Makarooroo, who chanced to\nbe together.\n\n\"Now, Mak,\" said the former, examining the caps of his rifle, \"explain\nto me what sort of trap this is that we're coming to, and what sort of\nbrutes we may expect to find in it.\"\n\n\"De trap, massa,\" replied our faithful follower, drawing the back of his\nhand across his mouth--\"de trap am be call _hopo_--\"\n\n\"Called what-o?\" inquired Peterkin.\n\n\"_Hopo_.\"\n\n\"Oh! go on.\"\n\n\"An' hims be made ob great number oh sticks tumble down--an' hole at de\nend ob dat; an' de beasties dat goes in be zebros, elosphants, eelands,\nbuff'los, gaffs, nocrices, noos, an' great more noders ob which me\nforgit de names.\"\n\n\"Oh! you forgit de names, do you?\"\n\n\"Yis, massa.\"\n\n\"Ah! it wouldn't be a great loss, Mak, if you were to forget the names\nof those you remember.\"\n\nThe conversation was interrupted at this point by the appearance of a\nbuffalo, which showed that we were drawing near to the scene of action.\nBut as Makarooroo's description is not remarkable for lucidity, I may\nexplain here that the hopo, or trap, consists of two parts; one part may\nbe termed the conducting hedges, the other the pit at their termination,\nand into which the game is driven.  The conducting hedges are formed in\nthe shape of the letter V.  At the narrow extremity there is a narrow\nlane, at the end of which is the terminating pit.  This pit is about\neight feet deep and fifteen feet broad, and its edges are made to\noverlap in such a way that once the animals are in it, they have no\nchance whatever of getting out again.  The surface of the pit is\nconcealed by a thin crust of green rushes, and the hedges are sometimes\na mile long, and nearly the same width apart at the outer extremities.\n\nWe were still a considerable distance from the outer ends of the hedges,\nwhen the natives spread out as above described, and I am convinced that\nour line extended over at least four miles of ground.  The circle, of\ncourse, narrowed as they advanced, shouting wildly, in order to drive\nthe game into the enclosure.\n\nThat the country was teeming with game soon became apparent, for ever\nand anon as we advanced a herd of gnus or buffaloes or hartbeests would\ndart affrighted from their cover, and sweep over the open ground into\nanother place of shelter, out of which they were again driven as the\nline advanced.  In the course of half an hour we drove out hartbeests,\nzebras, gnus, buffaloes, giraffes, rhinoceroses, and many other kinds of\nsmaller game, either singly or in herds.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, approaching Peterkin and me as we walked\ntogether, \"it is quite evident that if we wish to see this sport in\nperfection we must get outside the hedge, and run along towards the pit;\nfor there, in the natural course of things, we may expect the grand\nclimax.  What say you?  Shall we go?\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said I.\n\n\"Ditto,\" cried Peterkin.\n\nSo without more words we turned aside, followed by Makarooroo, leaped\nthe hedge, and running down along it soon reached the edge of the pit.\n\nHere we found a number of the natives assembled with spears, looking\neagerly through the interstices of the hedges in expectation of the\nadvancing herds.  We took up our stand on a convenient spot, and\nprepared to wait patiently.  But our patience was not severely tried.\nWe had not been more than five minutes stationed when the noise of the\nclosing line was heard, and a herd of buffaloes dashed wildly out from a\nsmall piece of jungle in which they had sought shelter, and galloped\nover the plain towards us.  Suddenly they halted, and stood for a moment\nsnuffing the air, as if uncertain what to do; while we could see, even\nat that distance, that every muscle of their bodies trembled with\nmingled rage and terror.  Before they could decide, a herd of gnus burst\nfrom the same place; and presently a dozen zebras galloped out, tossing\nup their heels and heads in magnificent indignation.  These last\nscattered, and approached the hedges; which caused several natives to\ndart into the enclosure, who from beneath the shelter of oval shields as\nlarge as themselves, threw their spears with unerring certainty into the\nsides of the terrified creatures.\n\nAt this moment there was a general rush from the scattered groups of\ntrees and clumps of jungle, for the animals were now maddened with\nterror, not only at the shouts of their human persecutors, but at their\nown wild cries and the increasing thunder of their tread.\n\nThe shouting and tumult now became excessive.  It was almost\nbewildering.  I looked round upon the faces of the negroes nearest to\nme.  They seemed to be almost insane with suppressed excitement, and\ntheir dark faces worked in a manner that was quite awful to witness.\n\nPresently there was a general and indiscriminate rush of all kinds of\nwild animals towards the narrow end of the hopo.  The natives pressed in\nupon them with wild cries.  Spears flew in all directions.  Ere long the\nplain was covered with wounded animals struggling and bellowing in their\ndeath-agonies.  As the rushing multitude drew nearer to the fatal pit,\nthey became crowded together, and now the men near us began to play\ntheir part.\n\n\"Look out, Jack!\"  I cried, as a buffalo bull with glaring eyes and\nfoaming jaws made a desperate effort to leap over the barrier in our\nvery faces.\n\nJack raised his rifle and fired; at the same instant a spear was sent\ninto the buffalo's breast, and it fell back to form a stumbling-block in\nthe way of the rushing mass.\n\nThe report of the rifle caused the whole herd to swerve from our side so\nviolently that they bore down the other side, until I began to fear the\nhedge would give way altogether; but they were met by the spears and the\nfurious yells of the natives there, and again swept on towards the\nnarrow lane.\n\nAnd now the head of the bellowing mass came to the edge of the pit.\nThose in front seemed to suspect danger, for they halted suddenly; but\nthe rush of those behind forced them on.  In another moment the thin\ncovering gave way, and a literal cataract of huge living creatures went\nsurging down into the abyss.\n\nThe scene that followed was terrible to witness; and I could not regard\nit with other than feelings of intense horror, despite my knowledge of\nthe fact that a large tribe of natives depended on the game then slain\nfor their necessary food.  The maddened animals attempted to leap out of\nthe pit, but the overlapping edges already referred to effectually\nprevented this until the falling torrent filled it up; then some of them\nsucceeded in leaping out from off the backs of their smothered comrades.\nThese, however, were quickly met and speared by the natives, while ever\nand anon the great mass was upheaved by the frantic struggles of some\ngigantic creature that was being smothered at the bottom.\n\nWhile this scene of wholesale destruction was going on, Makarooroo came\nup to me and begged me, with mysterious looks, to follow him out of the\ncrowd.\n\nI obeyed, and when we had got away from the immediate neighbourhood of\nthe turmoil, I said,--\"Well, Mak, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"De chief, massa, hims tell me few moments ago dat canoe wid Mbango and\noomans hab pass dis way to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"No, me forgit; hab pass yistumday.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yis, an' de chief hims say hims want us to stop wid him and go hunt for\nweek or two.  P'raps he no let us go 'way.\"\n\n\"That's just possible, Mak.  Have you told Jack?\"\n\n\"No, massa.\"\n\n\"Then go bring him and Peterkin hither at once.\"\n\nIn a few minutes my companions were with me, and we held a brief earnest\nconsultation as to what we should do.\n\n\"I think we should tell the chief we are anxious to be off at once, and\nleave him on good terms,\" said I.\n\nPeterkin objected to this.  \"No,\" said he; \"we cannot easily explain why\nwe are anxious to be off so hastily.  I counsel flight.  They won't find\nout that we are gone until it is too late to follow.\"\n\nJack agreed with this view, so of course I gave in, though I could not\nin my heart approve of such a method of sneaking away.  But our guide\nseemed also to be exceedingly anxious to be off, so we decided; and\nslipping quietly away under the shelter of the hedge, while the natives\nwere still busy with their bloody work, we soon gained the forest.  Here\nwe had no difficulty in retracing our steps to the village, where,\nhaving picked up our little companion, Njamie's son, who had been left\nto play with the little boys of the place, we embarked, swept down the\nstream, and were soon far beyond the chance of pursuit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\n\nA LONG CHASE, AND A HAPPY TERMINATION THEREOF.\n\nKnowing that unless we advanced with more than ordinary speed we could\nnot hope to overtake our friends for several days--a stern chase being\nproverbially a long one--we travelled a great part of the night as well\nas all day; and on our third day after quitting the scene of the curious\nhunt described in the last chapter, we descried the fugitives descending\nthe river about a quarter of a mile ahead of us.\n\nUnhappily we made a stupid mistake at this time.  Instead of waiting\nuntil we were near enough to be recognised, we shouted to our friends\nthe moment we saw their canoe.  I cannot say that we knew them to be our\nfriends, but we had every reason to suppose so.  The result of our shout\nwas that they supposed us to be enemies, and paddled away as if for\ntheir lives.  It was in vain that we tried to show by signs that we were\nnot enemies.\n\n\"Yell!\" cried Peterkin, turning to Makarooroo, who sat close behind him.\n\nOur guide opened his huge mouth, and gave utterance to a yell that might\nwell have struck terror into the heart of Mars himself.\n\n\"Stop! stay!\" cried Peterkin hastily.  \"I didn't mean a war-yell; I\nmeant a yell of--of _peace_.\"\n\n\"Me no hab a yell ob peace,\" said Makarooroo, with a look of perplexity.\n\n\"I should not suppose you had,\" observed Jack, with a quiet laugh, as he\ndipped his paddle more energetically than ever into the stream.--\"The\nfact is, Peterkin, that we shall have to go in for a long chase.  There\nis no doubt about it.  I see that there are at least four men in their\ncanoe, and if one of them is Mbango, as we have reason to believe, a\nstout and expert arm guides them.  But ho! give way! `never venture,\nnever win.'\"\n\nWith that we all plied our paddles with our utmost might.  The chase\nsoon became very exciting.  Ere long it became evident that the crews of\nthe two canoes were pretty equally matched, for we did not, apparently,\ndiminish the distance between us by a single inch during the next\nhalf-hour.\n\n\"What if it turns out not to be Mbango and his party after all?\"\nsuggested Peterkin, who wielded his light paddle with admirable effect.\n\nJack, who sat in the bow, replied that in that case we should have to\nmake the best apology and explanation we could to the niggers, and\nconsole ourselves with the consciousness of having done our best.\n\nFor some time the rapid dip of our paddles and the rush of our canoe\nthrough the water were the only sounds that were heard.  Then Peterkin\nspoke again.  He could never keep silence for any great length of time.\n\n\"I say, Jack, we'll never do it.  If we had only another man, or even a\nboy.\"  (Peterkin glanced at Njamie's little son, who lay sound asleep at\nthe bottom of the boat.) \"No, he won't do; we might as well ask a\nmosquito to help us.\"\n\n\"I say, lads, isn't one of the crew of that canoe a woman?\" said Jack,\nlooking over his shoulder, but not ceasing for an instant to ply his\npaddle.\n\n\"Can't tell,\" answered Peterkin.--\"What say you, Mak?\"\n\n\"Ye-is, massa,\" replied the guide, with some hesitation.  \"Me tink dat\nam be one ooman's arm what wag de paddil.  Oh! yis, me sartin sure now,\ndat am a ooman.\"\n\n\"That being the case,\" observed Jack, in a tone of satisfaction, \"the\nchase won't last much longer, for a woman's muscles can't hold out long\nat such a pace.  Ho! give way once more.\"\n\nIn less than five minutes the truth of Jack's remark became apparent,\nfor we began rapidly to overhaul the fugitives.  This result acted with\na double effect: while it inspirited us to additional exertion, it\ndepressed those whom we were pursuing, and so rendered them less capable\nthan before of contending with us.  There was evidently a good deal of\nexcitement and gesticulation among them.  Suddenly the man in the stern\nlaid down his paddle, and stooping down seized a gun, with which,\nturning round, he took deliberate aim at us.\n\n\"That's rather awkward,\" observed Jack, in a cool, quiet way, as if the\nawkwardness of the case had no reference whatever to him personally.\n\nWe did not, however, check our advance.  The man fired, and the ball\ncame skipping over the water and passed us at a distance of about two\nyards.\n\n\"Hum!  I expected as much,\" observed Jack.  \"When a bad shot points a\nbad gun at you, your best plan is to stand still and take your chance.\nIn such a case the chance is not a bad one.  Hollo! the rascal seems\nabout to try it again.  I say, boys, we must stop this.\"\n\nWe had now gained so much on the fugitives that we had reason to hope\nthat we might by signs enable them to understand that we were not\nenemies.  We had to make the attempt rather abruptly, for as Jack\nuttered his last remark, the man in the stern of the canoe we were\nchasing, having reloaded his gun, turned round to aim at us again.  At\nthe same time the rest of the crew suddenly ceased to paddle, in order\nto enable their comrade to take a steady aim.  It was evident that they\nrested all their hopes upon that shot disabling one of our number, and\nso enabling them to escape.  Seeing this, Makarooroo in desperation\nseized his rifle and levelled it.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Peterkin, hastily holding up his hand.  \"Give me your\nrifle, Mak; and yours, Ralph.  Now then, stop paddling for a moment;\nI'll try an experiment.\"\n\nSo saying, he sprang to his feet, and grasping a rifle in each hand,\nheld them high above his head, intending thus to show that we were\nwell-armed, but that we did not intend to use our weapons.\n\nThe device was happily successful: the man in the other canoe lowered\nthe gun with which he was in the act of taking aim at us.\n\n\"Now, boys, paddle slowly towards the bank,\" cried Peterkin, laying down\nthe rifles quickly and standing erect again with his empty hands\nextended in the air, to confirm the fugitives in regard to our good\nintentions.  They understood the sign, and also turned toward the bank,\nwhere in a few minutes both parties landed, at the distance of about two\nhundred yards from each other.\n\n\"Mak, you had better advance alone,\" said Jack.  \"If it is Mbango and\nhis friends, they will know you at once.  Don't carry your rifle; you\nwon't need it.\"\n\n\"Nay, Jack,\" I interposed; \"you do not act with your usual caution.\nShould it chance not to be Mbango, it were well that Mak should have his\nrifle and a companion to support him.\"\n\n\"O most sapient Ralph,\" said Peterkin, \"don't you know that Jack and I\nhave nothing to do but sit down on this bank, each with a double-barrel\nin his hand, and if anything like foul play should be attempted, four of\nthe enemy should infallibly bite the dust at the same time?  But you'd\nbetter go with Mak, since you're so careful of him.  We will engage to\ndefend you both.--Hollo, Puggy! take the line of our canoe here and\nfasten it to yonder bush.\"\n\nThe latter part of this remark was addressed to Njamie's little boy,\nwhose name we had never learned, and who had been called Puggy by\nPeterkin--not, let me remark, in anything approaching to a contemptuous\nspirit.  He evidently meant it as a title of endearment.  We had tacitly\naccepted it, and so had the lad, who for some time past had answered to\nthe name of Puggy, in utter ignorance, of course, as to its\nsignification.\n\nMak and I now advanced unarmed towards the negroes, and in a few seconds\nwe mutually recognised each other.  I was overjoyed to observe the\nwell-known face of Okandaga, who no sooner recognised her lover than she\nuttered a joyful shout and ran towards him.  I at the same time advanced\nto Mbango, and grasping his hand shook it warmly; but that good-hearted\nchief was not satisfied with such a tame expression of good will.\nSeizing me by the shoulders, he put forward his great flat nose and\nrubbed mine heartily therewith.  My first impulse was to draw back, but\nfortunately my better judgment came to my aid in time, and prevented me\nfrom running the risk of hurting the feelings of our black friend.  And\nI had at that time lived long enough to know that there is nothing that\nsinks so bitterly into the human heart as the repulse, however slightly,\nof a voluntary demonstration of affection.  I had made up my mind that\nif the dirtiest negro in all Africa should offer to rub noses with me, I\nwould shut my eyes and submit.\n\nI observed among the crew of Mbango's canoe a female figure who\ninstantly attracted my attention and awakened my sympathy.  She was\nseated on a rock, paying no attention whatever to the events that were\noccurring so near to her, and which, for aught she could tell, might be\nto her matter of life or death.  Her hands hung idly by her side; her\nbody was bowed forward; her head drooped on her breast; and her whole\nappearance indicated a depth of woe such as I have never before seen\nequalled.\n\nI pointed to her and looked at Mbango in surprise.  He looked first at\nthe woman and then at me, and shook his head mournfully; but being\nunable to speak to me, or I to him, of course I could not gather much\nfrom his looks.\n\nI was about to turn to our guide, when the woman raised her head a\nlittle, so that her face was exposed.  I at once recognised the features\nof Njamie, Mbango's favourite wife, and I was now at no loss to divine\nthe cause of her grief.\n\nStarting up in haste, I ran away back at full speed towards the spot\nwhere our canoe lay.  Jack and Peterkin, seeing how matters stood, were\nby that time advancing to meet us, and the little boy followed.  I\npassed them without uttering a word, seized the boy by the wrist, and\ndragged him somewhat violently towards the place where his mother sat.\n\n\"Hollo, Ralph,\" shouted Peterkin as I passed, \"see that you don't damage\nmy Puggy, else you'll have to--\"\n\nI heard no more.  The next instant I stood beside Njamie, and placed her\nboy before her.  I have never in my life witnessed such a mingling of\nintense eagerness, surprise, and joy, as was expressed by the poor woman\nwhen her eyes fell on the face of her child.  For one moment she gazed\nat him, and the expressions I have referred to flitted, or rather\nflashed, across her dusky countenance; then giving utterance to a\npiercing shriek, she sprang forward and clasped her son to her bosom.\n\nI would not have missed that sight for the world.  I know not very well\nwhat my thoughts were at the time, but the memory of that scene has\noften since, in my musings, filled me with inexpressible gladness; and\nin pondering the subject, I have felt that the witnessing of that\nmeeting has given additional force to the line in Scripture wherein the\nword \"love\" alone is deemed sufficiently comprehensive to describe the\nwhole character of the Almighty.\n\nHere, on the one hand, I beheld unutterable, indescribable woe; on the\nother hand, unutterable, inconceivable joy--both, I should suppose, in\ntheir extremest degree, and both resulting from pure and simple _love_.\nI pondered this much at the time; I have pondered it often since.  It is\na subject of study which I recommend to all who chance to read this\npage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\n\nI HAVE A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER AND A NARROW ESCAPE.\n\nThe happiness that now beamed in the faces of Makarooroo, Okandaga, and\nNjamie was a sufficient reward to us for all the trouble we had taken\nand all the risk we had run on their account.  Poor Njamie was\nexceedingly grateful to us.  She sought by every means in her power to\nshow this, and among other things, hearing us call her son by the name\nof Puggy, she at once adopted it, to the immense amusement and delight\nof Peterkin.\n\nAfter the first excitement of our meeting had subsided somewhat, we\nconsulted together as to what we should now do.  On the one hand, we\nwere unwilling to quit the scene of our hunting triumphs and adventures;\non the other hand, Makarooroo and his bride were anxious to reach the\nmission stations on the coast and get married in the Christian manner.\n\n\"Our opposing interests are indeed a little perplexing,\" said Jack,\nafter some conversation had passed on the subject.--\"No doubt, Mak, you\nand Mbango with his friends might reach the coast safely enough without\nus; but then what should we do without an interpreter?\"\n\nOur poor guide, whose troubles seemed as though they would never end,\nsighed deeply and glanced at his bride with a melancholy countenance as\nhe replied--\n\n\"Me'll go wid you, massa, an' Okandaga'll go to coast an' wait dere for\nme come.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" ejaculated Peterkin, \"that's all very well, Mak, but you'll do\nnothing of the sort.  That plan won't do, so we'll have to try again.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Peterkin,\" observed Jack.  \"That plan certainly will\nnot do; but I cannot think of any other that will, so we must just\nexercise a little self-denial for once, give up all further attacks on\nthe wild beasts of Africa, and accompany Mak to the coast.\"\n\n\"Could we not manage a compromise?\" said I.\n\n\"What be a cumprumoise?\" asked Makarooroo, who had been glancing\nanxiously from one to the other as we conversed.\n\nPeterkin laid hold of his chin, pursed up his mouth, and looked at me\nwith a gleeful leer.\n\n\"There's a chance for you, Ralph,\" said he; \"why don't you explain?\"\n\n\"Because it's not easy to explain,\" said I, considering the best way in\nwhich to convey the meaning of such a word.--\"A compromise, Mak, is--is\na bargain, a compact--at least so Johnson puts it--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" interposed Peterkin; \"so you see, Mak, when you agree with a\ntrader to get him an elephant-tusk, that's a cumprumoise, according to\nJohnson.\"\n\n\"No, no, Mak,\" said I quickly; \"Peterkin is talking nonsense.  It is not\na bargain of that kind; it's a--a--You know every question has two\nsides?\"\n\n\"Yis, massa.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose you took one side.\"\n\n\"Yis.\"\n\n\"And suppose I took the other side.\"\n\n\"Then suppose we were to agree to forsake our respective sides and meet,\nas it were, half-way, and thus hold the same middle course--\"\n\n\"Ay, down the middle and up again; that's it, Mak,\" again interrupted\nPeterkin--\"that's a cumprumoise.  In short, to put it in another and a\nclearer light, suppose that I were to resolve to hit you an awful whack\non one side of your head, and suppose that Ralph were to determine to\nhit you a frightful bang on the other side, then suppose that we were to\nagree to give up those amiable intentions, and instead thereof to give\nyou, unitedly, one tremendous smash on the place where, if you had one,\nthe bridge of your nose would be--_that_ would be a cumprumoise.\"\n\n\"Ho! ha! ha! hi!\" shouted our guide, rolling over on the grass and\nsplitting himself with laughter; for Makarooroo, like the most of his\nrace, was excessively fond of a joke, no matter how bad, and was always\nready on the shortest notice to go off into fits of laughter, if he had\nonly the remotest idea of what the jest meant.  He had become so\naccustomed at last to expect something jocular from Peterkin, that he\nalmost invariably opened his mouth to be ready whenever he observed our\nfriend make any demonstration that gave indication of his being about to\nspeak.\n\nFrom the mere force of sympathy Mbango began to laugh also, and I know\nnot how long the two would have gone on, had not Jack checked them by\nsaying--\n\n\"I suspect we are not very well fitted to instruct the unenlightened\nmind,\" (\"Ho--hi!\" sighed Makarooroo, gathering himself up and settling\ndown to listen), \"and it seems to me that you'll have to try again,\nPeterkin, some other mode of explanation.\"\n\n\"Very good, by all means,\" said our friend.--\"Now, Mak, look here.  You\nwant to go _there_\" (pointing to the coast with his left hand), \"and we\nwant to go there\" (pointing to the interior with his right hand).  \"Now\nif we both agree to go there,\" (pointing straight before him with his\nnose), \"_that_ will be a cumprumoise.  D'ye understand?\"\n\n\"Ho yis, massa, me compiperhend now.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said I; \"that's just it.  There is a branch of this river\nthat takes a great bend away to the north before it turns towards the\nsea, is there not?  I think I have heard yourself say so before now.\"\n\n\"Yis, massa, hall right.\"\n\n\"Well, let us go by that branch.  We shall be a good deal longer on the\nroute, but we shall be always nearing the end of our journey, and at the\nsame time shall pass through a good deal of new country, in which we may\nhope to see much game.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Jack; \"you have wisdom with you for once, Ralph--it seems\nfeasible.--What say you, Mak?  I think it a capital plan.\"\n\n\"Yis, massa, it am a copitle plan, sure 'nuff.\"\n\nThe plan being thus arranged and agreed to, we set about the execution\nof it at once, and ere long our two canoes were floating side by side\ndown the smooth current of the river.\n\nThe route which we had chosen led us, as I had before suspected, into\nthe neighbourhood of the gorilla country, and I was much gratified to\nlearn from Mbango, who had travelled over an immense portion of\nsouth-western Africa, that it was not improbable we should meet with\nseveral of those monstrous apes before finally turning off towards the\ncoast.  I say that I was much gratified to learn this; but I little\nimagined that I was at that time hastening towards a conflict that\nwell-nigh proved fatal to me, and the bare remembrance of which still\nmakes me shudder.\n\nIt occurred several weeks after the events just related.  We had gone\nashore for the purpose of hunting, our supply of provisions chancing at\nthat time to be rather low.  Feeling a desire to wander through the\nwoods in solitude for a short time, I separated from my companions.  I\nsoon came to regret this deeply, for about an hour afterwards I came\nupon the tracks of a gorilla.  Being armed only with my small-bore\ndouble rifle, and not being by any means confident of my shooting\npowers, I hesitated some time before making up my mind to follow the\ntracks.\n\nAt first I thought of retracing my steps and acquainting my comrades\nwith the discovery I had made; but the little probability there was of\nmy finding them within several hours deterred me.  Besides, I felt\nashamed to confess that I had been afraid to prosecute the chase alone;\nso, after pondering the matter a little, I decided on advancing.\n\nBefore doing so, however, I carefully examined the caps of my rifle and\nloosened my long hunting-knife in its sheath.  Then I cautiously\nfollowed up the track, making as little noise as possible, for I was\nwell aware of the watchfulness of the animal I was pursuing.\n\nThe footprints at first were not very distinct, but ere long I came on a\nmuddy place where they were deeply imprinted, and my anxiety was\nsomewhat increased by observing that they were uncommonly large--the\nlargest I had ever seen--and that, therefore, they had undoubtedly been\nmade by one of those solitary and gigantic males, which are always found\nto be the most savage.\n\nI had scarcely made this discovery when I came unexpectedly on the\ngorilla itself.  It was seated at the foot of a tree about fifty yards\nfrom the spot where I stood, the space between us being comparatively\nclear of underwood.  In an instant he observed me, and rose, at the same\ntime giving utterance to one of those diabolical roars which I have\nbefore referred to as being so terrible.\n\nI halted, and felt an irresistible inclination to fire at once; but\nremembering the oft-repeated warnings of my companions, I restrained\nmyself.  At that moment I almost wished, I freely confess, that the\ngorilla would run away.  But the monster had no such intention.  Again\nuttering his horrible roar, he began slowly to advance, at the same time\nbeating his drum-like chest with his doubled fist.\n\nI now felt that my hour of trial had come.  I must face the gorilla\nboldly, and act with perfect coolness.  The alternative was death.  As\nthe hideous creature came on, I observed that he was considerably larger\nthan the biggest we had yet seen; but, strange to say, this fact made no\ndeeper impression upon me.  I suppose that my whole mental and nervous\nbeing was wound up to the utmost possible state of tension.  I _felt_\nthat I was steady and able to brave the onset.  But I was not aware of\nthe severity of the test to which I was destined to be subjected.\nInstead of coming quickly on and deciding my fate at once, the savage\nanimal advanced slowly, sometimes a step or two at a time, and then\npausing for a moment ere it again advanced.  Sometimes it even sat down\non its haunches for a second or two, as if the weight of its overgrown\nbody were too much for its hind legs; but it did not cease all that time\nto beat its chest, and roar, and twist its features into the most\nindescribable contortions.  I suppose it took nearly five minutes to\nadvance to within twelve yards of me, but those five minutes seemed to\nme an hour.  I cannot describe the mental agony I endured.\n\nWhen within ten yards of me I could restrain myself no longer.  I raised\nmy rifle, aimed at its chest, and fired.  With a terrible roar it\nadvanced.  Again I fired, but without effect, for the gorilla rushed\nupon me.  In despair, I drew my hunting-knife and launched it full at\nthe brute's chest with all my might.  I saw the glittering blade enter\nit as the enormous paw was raised to beat me down.  I threw up my rifle\nto ward off the fatal blow, and at the same moment sprang to one side,\nin the hope of evading it.  The stock of the rifle was shattered to\npieces in an instant, and the blow, which would otherwise have fallen\nfull on my head or chest, was diverted slightly, and took effect on my\nshoulder, the blade of which was smashed as I was hurled with stunning\nviolence to the ground.  For one moment I felt as if I were falling\nheadlong down a precipice; the next, I became unconscious.\n\nOn recovering, I found myself lying on my back at the bottom of what\nappeared to be a large pit.  I must have lain there for a considerable\ntime, for I felt cold and stiff; and when I attempted to move, my\nwounded shoulder caused me unutterable anguish.  I knew, however, that I\nmust certainly perish if I did not exert myself; so with much difficulty\nI crept out of the pit.  The first object that met my eyes, on rising to\nmy feet, was the carcass of my late antagonist; which, on examination, I\nfound, though badly wounded by both bullets, had eventually been killed\nby the knife.  It must have died almost immediately after giving me the\nblow that had hurled me into the pit.  I had not observed this pit,\nowing to the screen of bushes that surrounded it, but I have now no\ndoubt that it was the means of saving my life.\n\nMy recollections of what followed this terrible adventure are\nexceedingly confused.  I remember that I wandered about in a state of\ndreamy uncertainty, endeavouring to retrace my steps to our encampment.\nI have a faint recollection of meeting, to my surprise, with Jack and\nPeterkin, and of their tender expressions of sympathy; and I have a very\nvivid remembrance of the agony I endured when Jack set my broken\nshoulder-blade and bandaged my right arm tightly to my side.  After\nthat, all was a confused dream, in which all the adventures I had ever\nhad with wild beasts were enacted over again, and many others besides\nthat had never taken place at all.\n\nUnder the influence of fever, I lay in a state of delirium for many days\nin the bottom of the canoe; and when my unclouded consciousness was at\nlength restored to me, I found myself lying in a bed, under the\nhospitable roof of a missionary, the windows of whose house looked out\nupon the sea.\n\nAnd now, reader, the record of our adventures is complete.  During the\nfew weeks that I spent with the kind missionary of the Cross, I gained\nstrength rapidly, and amused myself penning the first chapters of this\nbook.  Makarooroo and Okandaga were married, and soon became useful\nmembers of the Christian community on that part of the African coast.\nMbango and his friends also joined the missionary for a time, but\nultimately returned to the interior, whither I have no doubt they\ncarried some of the good influences that they had received on the coast\nalong with them.\n\nKing Jambai proved faithful to his engagement.  All our packages and\nboxes of specimens arrived safely at the coast; and when unpacked for\nexamination, and displayed in the large schoolroom of the station, the\ngorillas, and other rare and wonderful animals, besides curious plants,\naltogether formed a magnificent collection, the like of which has not\nyet been seen in Great Britain, and probably never will be.\n\nWhen I was sufficiently restored to stand the voyage, Jack and Peterkin\nand I embarked in a homeward-bound trading vessel, and taking leave of\nour kind friends of the coast, and of Makarooroo and Okandaga, who wept\nmuch at the prospect of separation from us, we set sail for Old England.\n\n\"Farewell,\" said I, as we leaned over the vessel's side and gazed sadly\nat the receding shore--\"farewell to you, kind missionaries and faithful\nnegro friends.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" added Peterkin, with a deep sigh, \"and fare-you-well, ye monstrous\napes; gorillas, fare-you-well!\"\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gorilla Hunters, by R.M.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":383,"split":"train"}
