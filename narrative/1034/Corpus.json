{"ori_id":"ef8b2d07b6d31531a169fefa7a7585b43aa71f60","title":"Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town","context":"Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town\n The story mainly takes place in two Ontario locales. In flashbacks, the main character, usually but not always called Alan (he appears to have been alphabetized rather than named, and will answer to any masculine name beginning with A), and his brothers (also alphabetized) grow up outside of the remote town of Kapuskasing. The novel opens with Alan's purchase of a home in the Kensington Market neighborhood of modern-day Toronto.\nThere are two main plotlines. Alan befriends Kurt, a thirtysomething punk who operates a dumpster-diving operation. Kurt uses computer components that he retrieves from the trash and turns them into Wi-Fi network access points. Kurt's goal is to blanket the entire neighborhood with free and secure Internet access by attaching his access points to buildings in a wireless mesh network with the permission of their owners. Kurt's plan doesn't really get off the ground until he forms a partnership with Alan, who puts a more professional face on the operation and sweet-talks many local owners into allowing the access points to use their space and a small amount of their electricity.\nThe second plotline features fantasy elements. Unbeknownst to most of the other characters, Alan and his brothers are not quite human. Their father is a mountain and their mother is a washing machine. Alan's eldest brother can see the future, his second-eldest is an island, his younger brother is undead, and his three youngest brothers are a set of Russian nesting dolls. Alan is the most normal-seeming of his family. Outwardly, he looks human, but he heals at an incredible rate, and if part of him is cut off, it will grow back, and the cut off part can be made to form a new copy of him, much like an earthworm does.\nAnother plot strand concerns Alan's neighbors, a household of students and artists which includes Mimi, a troubled young woman who like Alan is not quite human. Born with wings on her back and no family history, she lives with her abusive boyfriend Krishna, a musician\/bartender who can spot beings like Alan and his family, and hates them. Krishna amputates Mimi's wings every three months; she stays with him because she believes he's the only one willing and able to make her \"normal.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town,\nby Cory Doctorow\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The books are\ngoverned by Creative Commons licenses that permit their unlimited\nnoncommercial redistribution, which means that you're welcome to share\nthem with anyone you think will want to see them. In the words of Woody\nGuthrie:\n\n\"This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright #154085, for\na period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our\npermission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don't give a\ndern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it,\nthat's all we wanted to do.\"\n\nWhy do I do this? There are three reasons:\n\n* Short Term\n\nIn the short term, I'm generating more sales of my printed books. Sure,\ngiving away ebooks displaces the occasional sale, when a downloader\nreads the book and decides not to buy it. But it's far more common for a\nreader to download the book, read some or all of it, and decide to buy\nthe print edition. Like I said in my essay, Ebooks Neither E Nor Books,\n(http:\/\/craphound.com\/ebooksneitherenorbooks.txt), digital and print\neditions are intensely complimentary, so acquiring one increases your\nneed for the other. I've given away more than half a million digital\ncopies of my award-winning first novel, Down and Out in the Magic\nKingdom, and that sucker has blown through *five* print editions\n(yee-HAW!), so I'm not worried that giving away books is hurting my\nsales.\n\n* Long Term\n\nSome day, though, paper books will all but go away. We're already\nreading more words off of more screens every day and fewer words off of\nfewer pages every day. You don't need to be a science fiction writer to\nsee the writing on the wall (or screen, as the case may be).\n\nNow, if you've got a poor imagination, you might think that we'll enter\nthat era with special purpose \"ebook readers\" that simulate the\nexperience of carrying around \"real\" books, only digital. That's like\nbelieving that your mobile phone will be the same thing as the phone\nattached to your wall, except in your pocket. If you believe this sort\nof thing, you have no business writing sf, and you probably shouldn't be\nreading it either.\n\nNo, the business and social practice of ebooks will be way, way weirder\nthan that. In fact, I believe that it's probably too weird for us to\neven imagine today, as the idea of today's radio marketplace was\nincomprehensible to the Vaudeville artists who accused the radio station\nowners of mass piracy for playing music on the air. Those people just\ncould *not* imagine a future in which audiences and playlists were\nstatistically sampled by a special \"collection society\" created by a\nCongressional anti-trust \"consent decree,\" said society to hand out\nmoney collected from radio stations (who collected from soap\nmanufacturers and other advertisers), to compensate artists. It was\ninconceivably weird, and yet it made the artists who embraced it rich as\nhell. The artists who demanded that radio just *stop* went broke, ended\nup driving taxis, and were forgotten by history.\n\nI know which example I intend to follow. Giving away books costs me\n*nothing*, and actually makes me money. But most importantly, it\ndelivers the very best market-intelligence that I can get.\n\nWhen you download my book, please: do weird and cool stuff with\nit. Imagine new things that books are for, and do them. Use it in\nunlikely and surprising ways. Then *tell me about it*. Email me\n(doctorow@craphound.com) with that precious market-intelligence about\nwhat electronic text is for, so that I can be the first writer to figure\nout what the next writerly business model is. I'm an entrepreneur and I\nlive and die by market intel.\n\nSome other writers have decided that their readers are thieves and\npirates, and they devote countless hours to systematically alienating\ntheir customers. These writers will go broke. Not me -- I love you\npeople. Copy the hell out of this thing.\n\n* Medium Term\n\nThere may well be a time between the sunset of printed text and the\nappearance of robust models for unfettered distribution of electronic\ntext, an interregnum during which the fortunes of novelists follow those\nof poets and playwrights and other ink-stained scribblers whose\nindustries have cratered beneath them.\n\nWhen that happens, writerly income will come from incidental sources\nsuch as paid speaking engagements and commissioned articles. No, it's\nnot \"fair\" that novelists who are good speakers will have a better deal\nthan novelists who aren't, but neither was it fair that the era of radio\ngave a boost to the career of artists who played well in the studios,\nnor that the age of downloading is giving a boost to the careers of\nartists who play well live. Technology giveth and technology taketh\naway. I'm an sf writer: it's my job to love the future.\n\nMy chances of landing speaking gigs, columns, paid assignments, and the\nrest of it are all contingent on my public profile. The more people\nthere are that have read and enjoyed my work, the more of these gigs\nI'll get. And giving away books increases your notoriety a whole lot\nmore than clutching them to your breast and damning the pirates.\n\nSo there you have it: I'm giving these books away to sell more books, to\nfind out more about the market and to increase my profile so that I can\nland speaking and columnist gigs. Not because I'm some\npatchouli-scented, fuzzy-headed, \"information wants to be free\"\ninfo-hippie. I'm at it because I want to fill my bathtub with money and\nrub my hands and laugh and laugh and laugh.\n\n#\n\nDeveloping nations\n\nA large chunk of \"ebook piracy\" (downloading unauthorized ebooks from\nthe net) is undertaken by people in the developing world, where the\nper-capita GDP can be less than a dollar a day. These people don't\nrepresent any kind of commercial market for my books. No one in Burundi\nis going to pay a month's wages for a copy of this book. A Ukrainian\nfilm of this book isn't going to compete with box-office receipts in the\nUkraine for a Hollywood version, if one emerges. No one imports\ncommercial editions of my books into most developing nations, and if\nthey did. they'd be priced out of the local market.\n\nSo I've applied a new, and very cool kind of Creative Commons license to\nthis book: the Creative Commons Developing Nations License\n(http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/devnations\/2.0\/). What that means\nis that if you live in a country that's not on the World Bank's list of\nHigh-Income Countries\n(http:\/\/rru.worldbank.org\/DoingBusiness\/ExploreEconomies\/EconomyCharacteristics.aspx)\n, you get to do practically anything you want with this book.\n\nWhile residents of the rich world are limited to making noncommercial\ncopies of this book, residents of the developing world can do much\nmore. Want to make a commercial edition of this book? Be my guest. A\nfilm? Sure thing. A translation into the local language? But of course.\n\nThe sole restriction is that you *may not export your work with my book\nbeyond the developing world*. Your Ukrainian film, Guyanese print\nedition, or Ghanian translation can be freely exported within the\ndeveloping world, but can't be sent back to the rich world, where my\npaying customers are.\n\nIt's an honor to have the opportunity to help people who are living\nunder circumstances that make mine seem like the lap of luxury. I'm\nespecially hopeful that this will, in some small way, help developing\nnations bootstrap themselves into a better economic situation.\n\n#\n\nDRM\n\nThe worst technology idea since the electrified nipple-clamp is \"Digital\nRights Management,\" a suite of voodoo products that are supposed to\ncontrol what you do with information after you lawfully acquire it. When\nyou buy a DVD abroad and can't watch it at home because it's from the\nwrong \"region,\" that's DRM. When you buy a CD and it won't rip on your\ncomputer, that's DRM. When you buy an iTune and you can't loan it to a\nfriend, that's DRM.\n\nDRM doesn't work. Every file ever released with DRM locks on it is\ncurrently available for free download on the Internet. You don't need\nany special skills to break DRM these days: you just have to know how to\nsearch Google for the name of the work you're seeking.\n\nNo customer wants DRM. No one woke up this morning and said, \"Damn, I\nwish there was a way to do less with my books, movies and music.\"\n\nDRM can't control copying, but it can control competition. Apple can\nthreaten to sue Real for making Realmedia players for the iPod on the\ngrounds that Real had to break Apple DRM to accomplish this. The cartel\nthat runs licensing for DVDs can block every new feature in DVDs in\norder to preserve its cushy business model (why is it that all you can\ndo with a DVD you bought ten years ago is watch it, exactly what you\ncould do with it then -- when you can take a CD you bought a decade ago\nand turn it into a ringtone, an MP3, karaoke, a mashup, or a file that\nyou send to a friend?).\n\nDRM is used to silence and even jail researchers who expose its flaws,\nthanks to laws like the US DMCA and Europe's EUCD.\n\nIn case there's any doubt: I hate DRM. There is no DRM on this\nbook. None of the books you get from this site have DRM on them. If you\nget a DRMed ebook, I urge you to break the locks off it and convert it\nto something sensible like a text file.\n\nIf you want to read more about DRM, here's a talk I gave to Microsoft on\nthe subject:\n\nhttp:\/\/craphound.com\/msftdrm.txt\n\nand here's a paper I wrote for the International Telecommunications\nUnion about DRM and the developing world:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.eff.org\/IP\/DRM\/itu_drm.php\n\n=============================================================== Creative\nCommons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 License\n===============================================================\n\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE\nCOMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\").

I got lucky both\ntimes.\n\n========= The novel =========\n\nAlan sanded the house on Wales Avenue. It took six months, and the whole\ntime it was the smell of the sawdust, ancient and sweet, and the reek of\nchemical stripper and the damp smell of rusting steel wool.\n\nAlan took possession of the house on January 1, and paid for it in full\nby means of an e-gold transfer. He had to do a fair bit of hand-holding\nwith the realtor to get her set up and running on e-gold, but he loved\nto do that sort of thing, loved to sit at the elbow of a novitiate and\nguide her through the clicks and taps and forms. He loved to break off\nfor impromptu lectures on the underlying principles of the transaction,\nand so he treated the poor realtor lady to a dozen addresses on the\nnature of international currency markets, the value of precious metal as\na kind of financial lingua franca to which any currency could be\nconverted, the poetry of vault shelves in a hundred banks around the\nworld piled with the heaviest of metals, glinting dully in the\nfluorescent tube lighting, tended by gnomish bankers who spoke a hundred\nlanguages but communicated with one another by means of this universal\ntongue of weights and measures and purity.\n\nThe clerks who'd tended Alan's many stores -- the used clothing store in\nthe Beaches, the used book-store in the Annex, the collectible tin-toy\nstore in Yorkville, the antique shop on Queen Street -- had both\nbenefited from and had their patience tried by Alan's discursive\nnature. Alan had pretended never to notice the surreptitious rolling of\neyes and twirling fingers aimed templewise among his employees when he\ngot himself warmed up to a good oration, but in truth very little ever\nescaped his attention. His customers loved his little talks, loved the\nway he could wax rhapsodic about the tortured prose in a Victorian\npotboiler, the nearly erotic curve of a beat-up old table leg, the\nvoluminous cuffs of an embroidered silk smoking jacket. The clerks who\nlistened to Alan's lectures went on to open their own stores all about\ntown, and by and large, they did very well.\n\nHe'd put the word out when he bought the house on Wales Avenue to all\nhis prot\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9g\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9s: Wooden bookcases! His cell-phone rang every day, bringing\nnews of another wooden bookcase found at this flea market, that thrift\nstore, this rummage sale or estate auction.\n\nHe had a man he used part-time, Tony, who ran a small man-with-van\nservice, and when the phone rang, he'd send Tony over to his prot\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9g\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9's\nshop with his big panel van to pick up the case and deliver it to the\ncellar of the house on Wales Avenue, which was ramified by cold\nstorages, root cellars, disused coal chutes and storm cellars. By the\ntime Alan had finished with his sanding, every nook and cranny of the\ncellar was packed with wooden bookcases of every size and description\nand repair.\n\nAlan worked through the long Toronto winter at his sanding. The house\nhad been gutted by the previous owners, who'd had big plans for the\nbuilding but had been tempted away by a job in Boston. They'd had to\nsell fast, and no amount of realtor magic -- flowers on the dining-room\ntable, soup simmering on the stove -- could charm away the essential\ndagginess of the gutted house, the exposed timbers with sagging wires\nand conduit, the runnels gouged in the floor by careless draggers of\nfurniture. Alan got it for a song, and was delighted by his fortune.\n\nHe was drunk on the wood, of course, and would have paid much more had\nthe realtor noticed this, but Alan had spent his whole life drunk on\ntrivial things from others' lives that no one else noticed and he'd\ndeveloped the alcoholic's knack of disguising his intoxication. Alan\nwent to work as soon as the realtor staggered off, reeling with a New\nYear's Day hangover. He pulled his pickup truck onto the frozen lawn,\nunlocked the Kryptonite bike lock he used to secure the camper bed, and\ndragged out his big belt sander and his many boxes of sandpaper of all\ngrains and sizes, his heat strippers and his jugs of caustic chemical\npeeler. He still had his jumbled, messy place across town in a\nnondescript two-bedroom on the Danforth, would keep on paying the rent\nthere until his big sanding project was done and the house on Wales\nAvenue was fit for habitation.\n\nAlan's sanding project: First, finish gutting the house. Get rid of the\nsubstandard wiring, the ancient, lead-leaching plumbing, the cracked\ntile and water-warped crumbling plaster. He filled a half-dozen\ndumpsters, working with Tony and Tony's homie Nat, who was happy to help\nout in exchange for cash on the barrelhead, provided that he wasn't\nrequired to report for work on two consecutive days, since he'd need one\nday to recover from the heroic drinking he'd do immediately after Alan\nlaid the cash across his palm.\n\nOnce the house was gutted to brick and timber and delirious wood, the\nplumbers and the electricians came in and laid down their straight\nshining ducts and pipes and conduit.\n\nAlan tarped the floors and brought in the heavy sandblaster and stripped\nthe age and soot and gunge off of the brickwork throughout, until it\nglowed red as a golem's ass.\n\nAlan's father, the mountain, had many golems that called him home. They\nlived round the other side of his father and left Alan and his brothers\nalone, because even a golem has the sense not to piss off a mountain,\nespecially one it lives in.\n\nThen Alan tackled the timbers, reaching over his head with palm-sanders\nand sandpaper of ever finer grains until the timbers were as smooth as\nAdirondack chairs, his chest and arms and shoulders athrob with the\nagony of two weeks' work. Then it was the floorwork, but *not the floors\nthemselves*, which he was saving for last on the grounds that they were\nlow-hanging fruit.\n\nThis materialized a new lecture in his mind, one about the proper role\nof low-hanging fruit, a favorite topic of MBAs who'd patronize his\nstores and his person, giving him unsolicited advice on the care and\nfeeding of his shops based on the kind of useless book-learning and\njargon-slinging that Fortune 100 companies apparently paid big bucks\nfor. When an MBA said \"low-hanging fruit,\" he meant \"easy pickings,\"\nsomething that could and should be snatched with minimal effort. But\n*real* low-hanging fruit ripens last, and should be therefore picked as\nlate as possible. Further, picking the low-hanging fruit first meant\nthat you'd have to carry your bushel basket higher and higher as the day\nwore on, which was plainly stupid. Low-hanging fruit was meant to be\npicked last. It was one of the ways that he understood people, and one\nof the kinds of people that he'd come to understand. That was the game,\nafter all -- understanding people.\n\nSo the floors would come last, after the molding, after the stairs,\nafter the railings and the paneling. The railings, in particular, were\nhorrible bastards to get clean, covered in ten or thirty coats of enamel\nof varying colors and toxicity. Alan spent days working with a wire\nbrush and pointed twists of steel wool and oozing stinging paint\nstripper, until the grain was as spotless and unmarked as the day it\ncame off the lathe.\n\n*Then* he did the floors, using the big rotary sander first. It had been\n years since he'd last swung a sander around -- it had been when he\n opened the tin-toy shop in Yorkville and he'd rented one while he was\n prepping the place. The technique came back to him quickly enough, and\n he fell into a steady rhythm that soon had all the floors cool and dry\n and soft with naked, exposed woody heartmeat. He swept the place out\n and locked up and returned home.\n\nThe next day, he stopped at the Portuguese contractor-supply on\nOssington that he liked. They opened at five a.m., and the men behind\nthe counter were always happy to sketch out alternative solutions to his\namateur construction problems, they never mocked him for his\nincompetence, and always threw in a ten percent \"contractor's discount\"\nfor him that made him swell up with irrational pride that confused\nhim. Why should the son of a mountain need affirmation from runty\nPortugees with pencil stubs behind their ears and scarred fingers? He\npicked up a pair of foam-rubber knee pads and a ten-kilo box of\nlint-free shop rags and another carton of disposable paper masks.\n\nHe drove to the house on Wales Avenue, parked on the lawn, which was now\nstarting to thaw and show deep muddy ruts from his tires. He spent the\nnext twelve hours crawling around on his knees, lugging a tool bucket\nfilled with sandpaper and steel wool and putty and wood-crayons and shop\nrags. He ran his fingertips over every inch of floor and molding and\npaneling, feeling the talc softness of the sifted sawdust, feeling for\nrough spots and gouges, smoothing them out with his tools. He tried\nputtying over the gouges in the flooring that he'd seen the day he took\npossession, but the putty seemed like a lie to him, less honest than the\ngouged-out boards were, and so he scooped the putty out and sanded the\ngrooves until they were as smooth as the wood around them.\n\nNext came the beeswax, sweet and shiny. It almost broke his heart to\napply it, because the soft, newly exposed wood was so deliciously tender\nand sensuous. But he knew that wood left to its own would eventually\nchip and splinter and yellow. So he rubbed wax until his elbows ached,\n*massaged* the wax into the wood, buffed it with shop rags so that the\nhouse shone.\n\nTwenty coats of urethane took forty days -- a day to coat and a day to\ndry. More buffing and the house took on a high shine, a slippery\nslickness. He nearly broke his neck on the slippery staircase treads,\nand the Portuguese helped him out with a bag of clear grit made from\nground walnut shells. He used a foam brush to put one more coat of\nurethane on each tread of the stairs, then sprinkled granulated walnut\nshells on while it was still sticky. He committed a rare error in\njudgment and did the stairs from the bottom up and trapped himself on\nthe third floor, with its attic ceilings and dormer windows, and felt\nlike a goddamned idiot as he curled up to sleep on the cold, hard,\nslippery, smooth floor while he waited for his stairs to dry. The\nurethane must be getting to his head.\n\nThe bookcases came out of the cellar one by one. Alan wrestled them onto\nthe front porch with Tony's help and sanded them clean, then turned them\nover to Tony for urethane and dooring.\n\nThe doors were UV-filtering glass, hinged at the top and surrounded by\nfelt on their inside lips so that they closed softly. Each one had a\nsmall brass prop-rod on the left side that could brace it open. Tony had\nbeen responsible for measuring each bookcase after he retrieved it from\nAlan's prot\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9g\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9s' shops and for sending the measurements off to a glazier\nin Mississauga.\n\nThe glazier was technically retired, but he'd built every display case\nthat had ever sat inside any of Alan's shops and was happy to make use\nof the small workshop that his daughter and son-in-law had installed in\nhis garage when they retired him to the burbs.\n\nThe bookcases went into the house, along each wall, according to a\nsystem of numbers marked on their backs. Alan had used Tony's\nmeasurements and some CAD software to come up with a permutation of\nstacking and shouldering cases that had them completely covering every\nwall -- except for the wall by the mantelpiece in the front parlor, the\nwall over the countertop in the kitchen, and the wall beside the\nstaircases -- to the ceiling.\n\nHe and Tony didn't speak much. Tony was thinking about whatever people\nwho drive moving vans think about, and Alan was thinking about the story\nhe was building the house to write in.\n\nMay smelled great in Kensington Market. The fossilized dog shit had\nmelted and washed away in the April rains, and the smells were all\nspringy ones, loam and blossoms and spilled tetrapak fruit punch left\nbehind by the pan-ethnic street-hockey league that formed up\nspontaneously in front of his house. When the winds blew from the east,\nhe smelled the fish stalls on Spadina, salty and redolent of Chinese\nbarbecue spices. When it blew from the north, he smelled baking bread in\nthe kosher bakeries and sometimes a rare whiff of roasting garlic from\nthe pizzas in the steaming ovens at Massimo's all the way up on\nCollege. The western winds smelled of hospital incinerator, acrid and\nsmoky.\n\nHis father, the mountain, had attuned Art to smells, since they were the\nleading indicators of his moods, sulfurous belches from deep in the\ncaverns when he was displeased, the cold non-smell of spring water when\nhe was thoughtful, the new-mown hay smell from his slopes when he was\nhappy. Understanding smells was something that you did, when the\nmountain was your father.\n\nOnce the bookcases were seated and screwed into the walls, out came the\nbooks, thousands of them, tens of thousands of them.\n\nLittle kids' books with loose signatures, ancient first-edition\nhardcovers, outsized novelty art books, mass-market paperbacks,\nreference books as thick as cinderblocks. They were mostly used when\nhe'd gotten them, and that was what he loved most about them: They\nsmelled like other people and their pages contained hints of their\nlives: marginalia and pawn tickets, bus transfers gone yellow with age\nand smears of long-ago meals. When he read them, he was in three places:\nhis living room, the authors' heads, and the world of their previous\nowners.\n\nThey came off his shelves at home, from the ten-by-ten storage down on\nthe lakeshore, they came from friends and enemies who'd borrowed his\nbooks years before and who'd \"forgotten\" to return them, but Alan\n*never* forgot, he kept every book in a great and deep relational\ndatabase that had begun as a humble flatfile but which had been imported\ninto successive generations of industrial-grade database software.\n\nThis, in turn, was but a pocket in the Ur-database, The Inventory in\nwhich Alan had input the value, the cost, the salient features, the\nunique identifiers, and the photographic record of every single thing he\nowned, from the socks in his sock drawer to the pots in his\ncupboard. Maintaining The Inventory was serious business, no less\nimportant now than it had been when he had begun it in the course of\nsecuring insurance for the bookshop.\n\nAlan was an insurance man's worst nightmare, a customer from hell who'd\nmessenger over five bankers' boxes of detailed, cross-referenced\nInventory at the slightest provocation.\n\nThe books filled the shelves, row on row, behind the dust-proof,\nlight-proof glass doors. The books began in the foyer and wrapped around\nthe living room, covered the wall behind the dining room in the kitchen,\nfilled the den and the master bedroom and the master bath, climbed the\nshort walls to the dormer ceilings on the third floor. They were\norganized by idiosyncratic subject categories, and alphabetical by\nauthor within those categories.\n\nAlan's father was a mountain, and his mother was a washing machine -- he\nkept a roof over their heads and she kept their clothes clean. His\nbrothers were: a dead man, a trio of nesting dolls, a fortune teller,\nand an island. He only had two or three family portraits, but he\ntreasured them, even if outsiders who saw them often mistook them for\nlandscapes. There was one where his family stood on his father's slopes,\nMom out in the open for a rare exception, a long tail of extension cords\nsnaking away from her to the cave and the diesel generator's three-prong\noutlet. He hung it over the mantel, using two hooks and a level to make\nsure that it came out perfectly even.\n\nTony helped Alan install the shallow collectibles cases along the\nhouse's two-story stairwell, holding the level while Alan worked the\ncordless powerdriver. Alan's glazier had built the cases to Alan's\nspecs, and they stretched from the treads to the ceiling. Alan filled\nthem with Made-in-Occupied-Japan tin toys, felt tourist pennants from\ncentral Florida gator farms, a stone from Marie Laveau's tomb in the\nSt. Louis I Cemetery in New Orleans, tarnished brass Zippos, small\nframed comic-book bodybuilding ads, carved Polynesian coconut monkeys,\nmelamine transistor radios, Bakelite snow globes, all the tchotchkes\nhe'd accumulated over a lifetime of picking and hunting and digging.\n\nThey were gloriously scuffed and non-mint: he'd always sold off the\nsterile mint-in-package goods as quickly as he could, squirreling away\nthe items that were marked with \"Property of Freddy Terazzo\" in shaky\nballpoint, the ones with tooth marks and frayed boxes taped shut with\nbrands of stickytape not offered for sale in fifty years.\n\nThe last thing to go in was the cellar. They knocked out any wall that\nwasn't load-bearing, smeared concrete on every surface, and worked in a\nloose mosaic of beach glass and beach china, smooth and white with\nspidery blue illustrations pale as a dream. Three coats of urethane made\nthe surfaces gleam.\n\nThen it was just a matter of stringing out the cables for the clip-on\nhalogens whose beams he took care to scatter off the ceilings to keep\nthe glare to a minimum. He moved in his horsehair sofa and armchairs,\nhis big old bed, his pots and pans and sideboard with its novelty\ndecanters, and his entertainment totem.\n\nA man from Bell Canada came out and terminated the data line in his\nbasement, in a room that he'd outfitted with an uninterruptible power\nsupply, a false floor, dry fire extinguishers and a pipe-break\nsensor. He installed and configured the router, set up his modest rack\nand home servers, fished three four-pair wires through to the living\nroom, the den, and the attic, where he attached them to unobtrusive\nwireless access points and thence to weatherproofed omnidirectional\nantennae made from copper tubing and PVC that he'd affixed to the\nbuilding's exterior on short masts, aimed out over Kensington Market,\nblanketing a whole block with free Internet access.\n\nHe had an idea that the story he was going to write would require some\nperambulatory cogitation, and he wanted to be able to take his laptop\nanywhere in the market and sit down and write and hop online and check\nout little factoids with a search engine so he wouldn't get hung up on\nstupid details.\n\nThe house on Wales Avenue was done. He'd repainted the exterior a lovely\nrobin's-egg blue, fixed the front step, and planted a low-maintenance\ncombination of outsized rocks from the Canadian Shield and wild grasses\non the front lawn. On July first, Alan celebrated Canada Day by crawling\nout of the attic window onto the roof and watching the fireworks and\nlistening to the collective sighs of the people densely packed around\nhim in the Market, then he went back into the house and walked from room\nto room, looking for something out of place, some spot still rough and\nunsanded, and found none. The books and the collections lined the walls,\nthe fans whirred softly in the ceilings, the filters beneath the open\nwindows hummed as they sucked the pollen and particulate out of the\nrooms -- Alan's retail experience had convinced him long ago of the\nselling power of fresh air and street sounds, so he refused to keep the\nwindows closed, despite the fantastic volume of city dust that blew in.\n\nThe house was perfect. The ergonomic marvel of a chair that UPS had\ndropped off the previous day was tucked under the wooden sideboard he'd\nset up as a desk in the second-floor den. His brand-new computer sat\ncentered on the desk, a top-of-the-line laptop with a wireless card and\na screen big enough to qualify as a home theater in some circles.\n\nTomorrow, he'd start the story.\n\n#\n\nAlan rang the next-door house's doorbell at eight a.m. He had a bag of\ncoffees from the Greek diner. Five coffees, one for each bicycle locked\nto the wooden railing on the sagging porch plus one for him.\n\nHe waited five minutes, then rang the bell again, holding it down,\nlistening for the sound of footsteps over the muffled jangling of the\nbuzzer. It took two minutes more, he estimated, but he didn't mind. It\nwas a beautiful summer day, soft and moist and green, and he could\nalready smell the fish market over the mellow brown vapors of the strong\ncoffee.\n\nA young woman in long johns and a baggy tartan T-shirt opened the\ndoor. She was excitingly plump, round and a little jiggly, the kind of\nwoman Alan had always gone for. Of course, she was all of twenty-two,\nand so was certainly not an appropriate romantic interest for him, but\nshe was fun to look at as she ungummed her eyes and worked the sleep out\nof her voice.\n\n\"Yes?\" she said through the locked screen door. Her voice brooked no\nnonsense, which Alan also liked. He'd hire her in a second, if he were\nstill running a shop. He liked to hire sharp kids like her, get to know\nthem, try to winkle out their motives and emotions through observation.\n\n\"Good morning!\" Alan said. \"I'm Alan, and I just moved in next\ndoor. I've brought coffee!\" He hefted his sack in her direction.\n\n\"Good morning, Alan,\" she said. \"Thanks and all, but --\"\n\n\"Oh, no need to thank me! Just being neighborly. I brought five -- one\nfor each of you and one for me.\"\n\n\"Well, that's awfully nice of you --\"\n\n\"Nothing at all. Nice morning, huh? I saw a robin just there, on that\ntree in the park, not an hour ago. Fantastic.\"\n\n\"Great.\" She unlatched the screen door and opened it, reaching for the\nsack.\n\nAlan stepped into the foyer and handed it to her. \"There's cream and\nsugar in there,\" he said. \"Lots -- don't know how you folks take it, so\nI just figured better sure than miserable, better to err on the side of\ncaution. Wow, look at this, your place has a completely different layout\nfrom mine. I think they were built at the same time, I mean, they look a\nlot alike. I don't really know much about architecture, but they really\ndo seem the same, don't they, from the outside? But look at this! In my\nplace, I've got a long corridor before you get to the living room, but\nyour place is all open. I wonder if it was built that way, or if someone\ndid that later. Do you know?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, hefting the sack.\n\n\"Well, I'll just have a seat while you get your roommates up, all right?\nThen we can all have a nice cup of coffee and a chat and get to know\neach other.\"\n\nShe dithered for a moment, then stepped back toward the kitchen and the\nstairwell. Alan nodded and took a little tour of the living room. There\nwas a very nice media totem, endless shelves of DVDs and videos,\nincluding a good selection of Chinese kung-fu VCDs and black and white\ncomedies. There was a stack of guitar magazines on the battered coffee\ntable, and a cozy sofa with an afghan folded neatly on one arm. Good\nkids, he could tell that just by looking at their possessions.\n\nNot very security-conscious, though. She should have either kicked him\nout or dragged him around the house while she got her roomies out of\nbed. He thought about slipping some VCDs into his pocket and returning\nthem later, just to make the point, but decided it would be getting off\non the wrong foot.\n\nShe returned a moment later, wearing a fuzzy yellow robe whose belt and\nseams were gray with grime and wear. \"They're coming down,\" she said.\n\n\"Terrific!\" Alan said, and planted himself on the sofa. \"How about that\ncoffee, hey?\"\n\nShe shook her head, smiled a little, and retrieved a coffee for\nhim. \"Cream? Sugar?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Alan said. \"The Greek makes it just the way I like it. Black and\nstrong and aromatic. Try some before you add anything -- it's really\nfantastic. One of the best things about the neighborhood, if you ask\nme.\"\n\nAnother young woman, rail-thin with a shaved head, baggy jeans, and a\ntight t-shirt that he could count her ribs through, shuffled into the\nliving room. Alan got to his feet and extended his hand. \"Hi there! I'm\nAdam, your new neighbor! I brought coffees!\"\n\nShe shook his hand, her long fingernails sharp on his palm. \"Natalie,\"\nshe said.\n\nThe other young woman passed a coffee to her. \"He brought coffees,\" she\nsaid. \"Try it before you add anything to it.\" She turned to Alan. \"I\nthought you said your name was Alan?\"\n\n\"Alan, Adam, Andy. Doesn't matter, I answer to any of them. My mom had a\nhard time keeping our names straight.\"\n\n\"Funny,\" Natalie said, sipping at her coffee. \"Two sugars, three\ncreams,\" she said, holding her hand out. The other woman silently passed\nthem to her.\n\n\"I haven't gotten your name yet,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Right,\" the other one said. \"You sure haven't.\"\n\nA young man, all of seventeen, with straggly sideburns and a shock of\npink hair sticking straight up in the air, shuffled into the room,\nwearing cutoffs and an unbuttoned guayabera.\n\n\"Adam,\" Natalie said, \"this is Link, my kid brother. Link, this is\nArthur -- he brought coffees.\"\n\n\"Hey, thanks, Arthur,\" Link said. He accepted his coffee and stood by\nhis sister, sipping reverently.\n\n\"So that leaves one more,\" Alan said. \"And then we can get started.\"\n\nLink snorted. \"Not likely. Krishna doesn't get out of bed before noon.\"\n\n\"Krishna?\" Alan said.\n\n\"My boyfriend,\" the nameless woman said. \"He was up late.\"\n\n\"More coffee for the rest of us, I suppose,\" Alan said. \"Let's all sit\nand get to know one another, then, shall we?\"\n\nThey sat. Alan slurped down the rest of his coffee, then gestured at the\nsack. The nameless woman passed it to him and he got the last one, and\nset to drinking.\n\n\"I'm Andreas, your new next-door neighbor. I've just finished\nrenovating, and I moved in last night. I'm really looking forward to\nspending time in the neighborhood -- I work from home, so I'll be around\na bunch. Feel free to drop by if you need to borrow a cup of sugar or\nanything.\"\n\n\"That's so nice of you,\" Natalie said. \"I'm sure we'll get along fine!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Natalie. Are you a student?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" she said. She fished in the voluminous pockets of her jeans,\ntugging them lower on her knobby hips, and came up with a pack of\ncigarettes. She offered one to her brother -- who took it -- and one to\nAlan, who declined, then lit up. \"Studying fashion design at OCAD. I'm\nin my last year, so it's all practicum from now on.\"\n\n\"Fashion! How interesting,\" Alan said. \"I used to run a little vintage\nclothes shop in the Beaches, called Tropic\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1l.\"\n\n\"Oh, I *loved* that shop,\" she said. \"You had the *best* stuff! I used\nto sneak out there on the streetcar after school.\" Yup. He didn't\nremember *her*, exactly, but her *type*, sure. Solo girls with hardcover\nsketch books and vintage clothes home-tailored to a nice fit.\n\n\"Well, I'd be happy to introduce you to some of the people I know --\nthere's a vintage shop that a friend of mine runs in Parkdale. He's\nalways looking for designers to help with rehab and repros.\"\n\n\"That would be so cool!\"\n\n\"Now, Link, what do you study?\"\n\nLink pulled at his smoke, ashed in the fireplace grate. \"Not much. I\ndidn't get into Ryerson for electrical engineering, so I'm spending a\nyear as a bike courier, taking night classes, and reapplying for next\nyear.\"\n\n\"Well, that'll keep you out of trouble at least,\" Alan said. He turned\nto the nameless woman.\n\n\"So, what do you do, *Apu*?\" she said to him, before he could say\nanything.\n\n\"Oh, I'm retired, Mimi,\" he said.\n\n\"Mimi?\" she said.\n\n\"Why not? It's as good a name as any.\"\n\n\"Her name is --\" Link started to say, but she cut him off.\n\n\"Mimi is as good a name as any. I'm unemployed. Krishna's a bartender.\"\n\n\"Are you looking for work?\"\n\nShe smirked. \"Sure. Whatcha got?\"\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\n\"I've got three-quarters of a degree in environmental studies, one year\nof kinesiology, and a half-written one-act play. Oh, and student debt\nuntil the year 3000.\"\n\n\"A play!\" he said, slapping his thighs. \"You should finish it. I'm a\nwriter, too, you know.\"\n\n\"I thought you had a clothing shop.\"\n\n\"I did. And a bookshop, and a collectibles shop, and an antique\nshop. Not all at the same time, you understand. But now I'm\nwriting. Going to write a story, then I imagine I'll open another\nshop. But I'm more interested in *you*, Mimi, and your play. Why\nhalf-finished?\"\n\nShe shrugged and combed her hair back with her fingers. Her hair was\nbrown and thick and curly, down to her shoulders. Alan adored curly\nhair. He'd had a clerk at the comics shop with curly hair just like\nhers, an earnest and bright young thing who drew her own comics in the\nback room on her breaks, using the receiving table as a drawing\nboard. She'd never made much of a go of it as an artist, but she did end\nup publishing a popular annual anthology of underground comics that had\ncaptured the interest of the *New Yorker* the year before. \"I just ran\nout of inspiration,\" Mimi said, tugging at her hair.\n\n\"Well, there you are. Time to get inspired again. Stop by any time and\nwe'll talk about it, all right?\"\n\n\"If I get back to it, you'll be the first to know.\"\n\n\"Tremendous!\" he said. \"I just know it'll be fantastic. Now, who plays\nthe guitar?\"\n\n\"Krishna,\" Link said. \"I noodle a bit, but he's really good.\"\n\n\"He sure is,\" Alan said. \"He was in fine form last night, about three\na.m.!\" He chuckled pointedly.\n\nThere was an awkward silence. Alan slurped down his second\ncoffee. \"Whoops!\" he said. \"I believe I need to impose on you for the\nuse of your facilities?\"\n\n\"What?\" Natalie and Link said simultaneously.\n\n\"He wants the toilet,\" Mimi said. \"Up the stairs, second door on the\nright. Jiggle the handle after you flush.\"\n\nThe bathroom was crowded with too many towels and too many\ntoothbrushes. The sink was powdered with blusher and marked with\nlipstick and mascara residue. It made Alan feel at home. He liked young\npeople. Liked their energy, their resentment, and their\nenthusiasm. Didn't like their guitar-playing at three a.m.; but he'd\nsort that out soon enough.\n\nHe washed his hands and carefully rinsed the long curly hairs from the\nbar before replacing it in its dish, then returned to the living room.\n\n\"Abel,\" Mimi said, \"sorry if the guitar kept you up last night.\"\n\n\"No sweat,\" Alan said. \"It must be hard to find time to practice when\nyou work nights.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Natalie said. \"Exactly right! Krishna always practices when\nhe comes back from work. He blows off some steam so he can get to\nbed. We just all learned to sleep through it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Alan said, \"to be honest, I'm hoping I won't have to learn to do\nthat. But I think that maybe I have a solution we can both live with.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Mimi said, jutting her chin forward.\n\n\"It's easy, really. I can put up a resilient channel and a baffle along\nthat wall there, soundproofing. I'll paint it over white and you won't\neven notice the difference. Shouldn't take me more than a week. Happy to\ndo it. Thick walls make good neighbors.\"\n\n\"We don't really have any money to pay for renovations,\" Mimi said.\n\nAlan waved his hand. \"Who said anything about money? I just want to\nsolve the problem. I'd do it on my side of the wall, but I've just\nfinished renovating.\"\n\nMimi shook her head. \"I don't think the landlord would go for it.\"\n\n\"You worry too much,\" he said. \"Give me your landlord's number and I'll\nsort it out with him, all right?\"\n\n\"All right!\" Link said. \"That's terrific, Albert, really!\"\n\n\"All right, Mimi? Natalie?\"\n\nNatalie nodded enthusiastically, her shaved head whipping up and down on\nher thin neck precariously. Mimi glared at Natalie and Link. \"I'll ask\nKrishna,\" she said.\n\n\"All right, then!\" Alan said. \"Let me measure up the wall and I'll start\nshopping for supplies.\" He produced a matte black, egg-shaped digital\ntape measure and started shining pinpoints of laser light on the wall,\nclicking the egg's buttons when he had the corners tight. The Portuguese\nclerks at his favorite store had dissolved into hysterics when he'd\nproudly shown them the $300 gadget, but they were consistently impressed\nby the exacting CAD drawings of his projects that he generated with its\noutput. Natalie and Link stared in fascination as he did his thing with\nmore showmanship than was technically necessary, though Mimi made a\npoint of rolling her eyes.\n\n\"Don't go spending any money yet, cowboy,\" she said. \"I've still got to\ntalk to Krishna, and *you've* still got to talk with the landlord.\"\n\nHe fished in the breast pocket of his jean jacket and found a stub of\npencil and a little steno pad, scribbled his cell phone number, and tore\noff the sheet. He passed the sheet, pad, and pencil to Mimi, who wrote\nout the landlord's number and passed it back to him.\n\n\"Okay!\" Alan said. \"There you go. It's been a real pleasure meeting you\nfolks. I know we're going to get along great. I'll call your landlord\nright away and you call me once Krishna's up, and I'll see you tomorrow\nat ten a.m. to start construction, God willin' and the crick don't\nrise.\"\n\nLink stood and extended his hand. \"Nice to meet you, Albert,\" he\nsaid. \"Really. Thanks for the muds, too.\" Natalie gave him a bony hug,\nand Mimi gave him a limp handshake, and then he was out in the sunshine,\nhead full of designs and logistics and plans.\n\n#\n\nThe sun set at nine p.m. in a long summertime blaze. Alan sat down on\nthe twig-chair on his front porch, pulled up the matching twig table,\nand set down a wine glass and the bottle of Niagara Chardonnay he'd\nbrought up from the cellar. He poured out a glass and held it up to the\nlight, admiring the new blister he'd gotten on his pinky finger while\nhauling two-by-fours and gyprock from his truck to his neighbors' front\nroom. Kids rode by on bikes and punks rode by on skateboards. Couples\nwandered through the park across the street, their murmurous\nconversations clear on the whispering breeze that rattled the leaves.\n\nHe hadn't gotten any writing done, but that was all right. He had plenty\nof time, and once the soundwall was in, he'd be able to get a good\nnight's sleep and really focus down on the story.\n\nA Chinese girl and a white boy walked down the sidewalk, talking\nintensely. They were all of six, and the boy had a Russian accent. The\nMarket's diversity always excited Alan. The boy looked a little like\nAlan's brother Doug (Dan, David, Dearborne) had looked when he was that\nage.\n\nDoug was the one he'd helped murder. All the brothers had helped with\nthe murder, even Charlie (Clem, Carlos, Cory), the island, who'd opened\na great fissure down his main fault line and closed it up over Doug's\ncorpse, ensuring that their parents would be none the wiser. Doug was a\nstubborn son-of-a-bitch, though, and his corpse had tunneled up over the\nnext six years, built a raft from the bamboo and vines that grew in\nproliferation on Carlos's west coast. He sailed the raft through\ntreacherous seas for a year and a day, beached it on their father's\ngentle slope, and presented himself to their mother. By that time, the\ncorpse had decayed and frayed and worn away, so that he was little more\nthan a torso and stumps, his tongue withered and stiff, but he pled his\ncase to their mother, and she was so upset that her load overbalanced\nand they had to restart her. Their father was so angry that he quaked\nand caved in Billy (Bob, Brad, Benny)'s room, crushing all his tools and\nall his trophies.\n\nBut a lot of time had gone by and the brothers weren't kids\nanymore. Alan was nineteen, ready to move to Toronto and start scouting\nfor real estate. Only Doug still looked like a little boy, albeit a\nstumpy and desiccated one. He hollered and stamped until his fingerbones\nrattled on the floor and his tongue flew across the room and cracked on\nthe wall. When his anger was spent, he crawled atop their mother and let\nher rock him into a long, long slumber.\n\nAlan had left his father and his family the next morning, carrying a\nrucksack heavy with gold from under the mountain and walked down to the\ntown, taking the same trail he'd walked every school day since he was\nfive. He waved to the people that drove past him on the highway as he\nwaited at the bus stop. He was the first son to leave home under his own\npower, and he'd been full of butterflies, but he had a half-dozen good\nbooks that he'd checked out of the Kapuskasing branch library to keep\nhim occupied on the 14-hour journey, and before he knew it, the bus was\npulling off the Gardiner Expressway by the SkyDome and into the midnight\nstreets of Toronto, where the buildings stretched to the sky, where the\nblinking lights of the Yonge Street sleaze-strip receded into the\ndistance like a landing strip for a horny UFO.\n\nHis liquid cash was tight, so he spent that night in the Rex Hotel, in\nthe worst room in the house, right over the cymbal tree that the\njazz-drummer below hammered on until nearly two a.m.. The bed was small\nand hard and smelled of bleach and must, the washbasin gurgled\nmysteriously and spat out moist sewage odors, and he'd read all his\nbooks, so he sat in the window and watched the drunks and the hipsters\nstagger down Queen Street and inhaled the smoky air and before he knew\nit, he'd nodded off in the chair with his heavy coat around him like a\nblanket.\n\nThe Chinese girl abruptly thumped her fist into the Russian boy's\near. He clutched his head and howled, tears streaming down his face,\nwhile the Chinese girl ran off. Alan shook his head, got up off his\nchair, went inside for a cold washcloth and an ice pack, and came back\nout.\n\nThe Russian boy's face was screwed up and blotchy and streaked with\ntears, and it made him look even more like Doug, who'd always been a\ncrybaby. Alan couldn't understand him, but he took a guess and knelt at\nhis side and wiped the boy's face, then put the ice pack in his little\nhand and pressed it to the side of his little head.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said, taking the boy's other hand. \"Where do your parents\nlive? I'll take you home.\"\n\n#\n\nAlan met Krishna the next morning at ten a.m., as Alan was running a\ntable saw on the neighbors' front lawn, sawing studs up to fit the\nsecond wall. Krishna came out of the house in a dirty dressing gown, his\nshort hair matted with gel from the night before. He was tall and fit\nand muscular, his brown calves flashing through the vent of his\nhousecoat. He was smoking a hand-rolled cigarette and clutching a can of\nCoke.\n\nAlan shut down the saw and shifted his goggles up to his forehead. \"Good\nmorning,\" he said. \"I'd stay on the porch if I were you, or maybe put on\nsome shoes. There're lots of nails and splinters around.\"\n\nKrishna, about to step off the porch, stepped back. \"You must be Alvin,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Yup,\" Alan said, going up the stairs, sticking out his hand. \"And you\nmust be Krishna. You're pretty good with a guitar, you know that?\"\n\nKrishna shook briefly, then snatched his hand back and rubbed at his\nstubble. \"I know. You're pretty fucking loud with a table saw.\"\n\nAlan looked sheepish. \"Sorry about that. I wanted to get the heavy work\ndone before it got too hot. Hope I'm not disturbing you too much --\ntoday's the only sawing day. I'll be hammering for the next day or two,\nthen it's all wet work -- the loudest tool I'll be using is\nsandpaper. Won't take more than four days, tops, anyway, and we'll be in\ngood shape.\"\n\nKrishna gave him a long, considering look. \"What are you, anyway?\"\n\n\"I'm a writer -- for now. Used to have a few shops.\"\n\nKrishna blew a plume of smoke off into the distance. \"That's not what I\nmean. What *are* you, Adam? Alan? Andrew? I've met people like you\nbefore. There's something not right about you.\"\n\nAlan didn't know what to say to that. This was bound to come up someday.\n\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\n\"Up north. Near Kapuskasing,\" he said. \"A little town.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" Krishna said. \"Are you an alien? A fairy? What?\"\n\nAlan shook his head. \"Just about what I seem, I'm afraid. Just a guy.\"\n\n\"Just about, huh?\" he said.\n\n\"Just about.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of wiggle room in *just about*, Arthur. It's a free\ncountry, but just the same, I don't think I like you very much. Far as\nI'm concerned, you could get lost and never come back.\"\n\n\"Sorry you feel that way, Krishna. I hope I'll grow on you as time goes\nby.\"\n\n\"I hope that you won't have the chance to,\" Krishna said, flicking the\ndog end of his cigarette toward the sidewalk.\n\n#\n\nAlan didn't like or understand Krishna, but that was okay. He understood\nthe others just fine, more or less. Natalie had taken to helping him out\nafter her classes, mudding and taping the drywall, then sanding it down,\npriming, and painting it. Her brother Link came home from work sweaty\nand grimy with road dust, but he always grabbed a beer for Natalie and\nAlan after his shower, and they'd sit on the porch and kibbitz.\n\nMimi was less hospitable. She sulked in her room while Alan worked on\nthe soundwall, coming downstairs only to fetch her breakfast and coldly\nignoring him then, despite his cheerful greetings. Alan had to force\nhimself not to stare after her as she walked into the kitchen, carrying\nyesterday's dishes down from her room; then out again, with a sandwich\non a fresh plate. Her curly hair bounced as she stomped back and forth,\nher soft, round buttocks flexing under her long-johns.\n\nOn the night that Alan and Natalie put the first coat of paint on the\nwall, Mimi came down in a little baby-doll dress, thigh-high striped\ntights, and chunky shoes, her face painted with swaths of glitter.\n\n\"You look wonderful, baby,\" Natalie told her as she emerged onto the\nporch. \"Going out?\"\n\n\"Going to the club,\" she said. \"DJ None Of Your Fucking Business is\nspinning and Krishna's going to get me in for free.\"\n\n\"Dance music,\" Link said disgustedly. Then, to Alan, \"You know this\nstuff? It's not playing music, it's playing *records*. Snore.\"\n\n\"Sounds interesting,\" Alan said. \"Do you have any of it I could listen\nto? A CD or some MP3s?\"\n\n\"Oh, *that's* not how you listen to this stuff,\" Natalie said. \"You have\nto go to a club and *dance*.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Alan said. \"Do I have to take ecstasy, or is that optional?\"\n\n\"It's mandatory,\" Mimi said, the first words she'd spoken to him all\nweek. \"Great fistfuls of E, and then you have to consume two pounds of\ncandy necklaces at an after-hours orgy.\"\n\n\"Not really,\" Natalie said, *sotto voce*. \"But you *do* have to\ndance. You should go with, uh, Mimi, to the club. DJ None Of Your\nFucking Business is *amazing*.\"\n\n\"I don't think Mimi wants company,\" Alan said.\n\n\"What makes you say that?\" Mimi said, making a dare of it with hipshot\nbody language. \"Get changed and we'll go together. You'll have to pay to\nget in, though.\"\n\nLink and Natalie exchanged a raised eyebrow, but Alan was already headed\nfor his place, fumbling for his keys. He bounded up the stairs, swiped a\nwashcloth over his face, threw on a pair of old cargo pants and a faded\nSteel Pole Bathtub T-shirt he'd bought from a head-shop one day because\nhe liked the words' incongruity, though he'd never heard the band, added\na faded jean jacket and a pair of high-tech sneakers, grabbed his phone,\nand bounded back down the stairs. He was convinced that Mimi would be\nlong gone by the time he got back out front, but she was still there,\nthe stripes in her stockings glowing in the slanting light.\n\n\"Retro chic,\" she said, and laughed nastily. Natalie gave him a thumbs\nup and a smile that Alan uncharitably took for a simper, and felt guilty\nabout it immediately afterward. He returned the thumbs up and then took\noff after Mimi, who'd already started down Augusta, headed for Queen\nStreet.\n\n\"What's the cover charge?\" he said, once he'd caught up.\n\n\"Twenty bucks,\" she said. \"It's an all-ages show, so they won't be\nselling a lot of booze, so there's a high cover.\"\n\n\"How's the play coming?\"\n\n\"Fuck off about the play, okay?\" she said, and spat on the sidewalk.\n\n\"All right, then,\" he said. \"I'm going to start writing my story\ntomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"Your story, huh?\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\n\"What's that for?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked playfully.\n\n\"Why are you writing a story?\"\n\n\"Well, I have to! I've completely redone the house, built that soundwall\n-- it'd be a shame not to write the story now.\"\n\n\"You're writing a story about your house?\"\n\n\"No, *in* my house. I haven't decided what the story's about\nyet. That'll be job one tomorrow.\"\n\n\"You did all that work to have a place to write? Man, I thought *I* was\ninto procrastination.\"\n\nHe chuckled self-deprecatingly. \"I guess you could look at it that\nway. I just wanted to have a nice, creative environment to work in. The\nstory's important to me, is all.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with it once you're done? There aren't a whole\nlot of places that publish short stories these days, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it! I'd write a novel if I had the patience. But this isn't\nfor publication -- yet. It's going into a drawer to be published after I\ndie.\"\n\n\"*What*?\"\n\n\"Like Emily Dickinson. Wrote thousands of poems, stuck 'em in a drawer,\ndropped dead. Someone else published 'em and she made it into the\ncanon. I'm going to do the same.\"\n\n\"That's nuts -- are you dying?\"\n\n\"Nope. But I don't want to put this off until I am. Could get hit by a\nbus, you know.\"\n\n\"You're a goddamned psycho. Krishna was right.\"\n\n\"What does Krishna have against me?\"\n\n\"I think we both know what that's about,\" she said.\n\n\"No, really, what did I ever do to him?\"\n\nNow they were on Queen Street, walking east in the early evening crowd,\nsurrounded by summertime hipsters and wafting, appetizing smells from\nthe bistros and Jamaican roti shops. She stopped abruptly and grabbed\nhis shoulders and gave him a hard shake.\n\n\"You're full of shit, Ad-man. I know it and you know it.\"\n\n\"I really don't know what you're talking about, honestly!\"\n\n\"Fine, let's do this.\" She clamped her hand on his forearm and dragged\nhim down a side street and turned down an alley. She stepped into a\ndoorway and started unbuttoning her Alice-blue babydoll dress. Alan\nlooked away, embarrassed, glad of the dark hiding his blush.\n\nOnce the dress was unbuttoned to her waist, she reached around behind\nher and unhooked her white underwire bra, which sagged forward under the\nweight of her heavy breasts. She turned around, treating him to a\nglimpse of the full curve of her breast under her arm, and shrugged the\ndress down around her waist.\n\nShe had two stubby, leathery wings growing out of the middle of her\nback, just above the shoulder blades. They sat flush against her back,\nand as Alan watched, they unfolded and flexed, flapped a few times, and\nsettled back into their position, nested among the soft roll of flesh\nthat descended from her neck.\n\nInvoluntarily, he peered forward, examining the wings, which were\ncovered in fine downy brown hairs, and their bases, roped with muscle\nand surrounded by a mess of ugly scars.\n\n\"You...*sewed*...these on?\" Alan said, aghast.\n\nShe turned around, her eyes bright with tears. Her breasts swung free of\nher unhooked bra. \"No, you fucking idiot. I sawed them off. Four times a\nyear. They just grow back. If I don't cut them, they grow down to my\nankles.\"\n\n#\n\nMimi was curiously and incomprehensibly affectionate after she had\nbuttoned up her dress and resumed walking toward the strip of clubs\nalong Richmond Street. She put her hand on his forearm and murmured\nfunny commentary about the outlandishly attired club kids in their\nplastic cowboy hats, Sailor Moon outfits, and plastic tuxedoes. She\nplucked a cigarette from his lips, dragged on it, and put it back into\nhis mouth, still damp with her saliva, an act that sent a shiver down\nAlan's neck and made the hair on the backs of his hands stand up.\n\nShe seemed to think that the wings were self-explanatory and needed no\nfurther discussion, and Alan was content to let them stay in his mind's\neye, bat-shaped, powerful, restless, surrounded by their gridwork of\nangry scars.\n\nOnce they got to the club, Shasta Disaster, a renovated brick bank with\nrobotic halogen spots that swept the sidewalk out front with a throbbing\npenis logomark, she let go of his arm and her body stiffened. She said\nsomething in the doorman's ear, and he let her pass. When Alan tried to\nfollow her, the bouncer stopped him with a meaty hand on his chest.\n\n\"Can I help you sir,\" he said flatly. He was basically a block of fat\nand muscle with a head on top, arms as thick as Alan's thighs barely\ncontained in a silver button-down short-sleeve shirt that bound at his\narmpits.\n\n\"Do I pay the cover to you?\" Alan asked, reaching for his wallet.\n\n\"No, you don't get to pay a cover. You're not coming in.\"\n\n\"But I'm with her,\" Alan said, gesturing in the direction Mimi had\ngone. \"I'm Krishna's and her neighbor.\"\n\n\"She didn't mention it,\" the bouncer said. He was smirking now.\n\n\"Look,\" Alan said. \"I haven't been to a club in twenty years. Do you\nguys still take bribes?\"\n\nThe bouncer rolled his eyes. \"Some might. I don't. Why don't you head\nhome, sir.\"\n\n\"That's it, huh?\" Alan said. \"Nothing I can say or do?\"\n\n\"Don't be a smart guy,\" the bouncer said.\n\n\"Good night, then,\" Alan said, and turned on his heel. He walked back up\nto Queen Street, which was ablaze with TV lights from the open studio\nout front of the CHUM-City building. Hordes of teenagers in tiny,\noutrageous outfits milled back and forth from the coffee shops to the\nstudio window, where some band he'd never heard of was performing,\ngenerally ambling southward to the clubs. Alan bought himself a coffee\nwith a sixteen-syllable latinate trade name\n(\"Moch-a-latt-a-meraican-a-spress-a-chino,\" he liked to call them) at\nthe Second Cup and hailed a taxi.\n\nHe felt only the shortest moment of anger at Mimi, but it quickly cooled\nand then warmed again, replaced by bemusement. Decrypting the mystical\ndeeds of young people had been his hobby and avocation since he hired\nhis first cranky-but-bright sixteen-year-old. Mimi had played him, he\nknew that, deliberately set him up to be humiliated. But she'd also\nwanted a moment alone with him, an opportunity to confront him with her\nwings -- wings that were taking on an air of the erotic now in his\nimagination, much to his chagrin. He imagined that they were soft and\npliable as lips but with spongy cartilage beneath that gave way like\nlivid nipple flesh. The hair must be silky, soft, and slippery as a\npubic thatch oiled with sweat and juices. Dear oh dear, he was really\ngetting himself worked into a lather, imagining the wings drooping to\nthe ground, unfolding powerfully in his living room, encircling him,\nenveloping him as his lips enveloped the tendons on her neck, as her\nvagina enveloped him... Whew!\n\nThe taxi drove right past his place and that gave Alan a much-needed\ndistraction, directing the cabbie through the maze of Kensington\nMarket's one-way streets back around to his front door. He tipped the\ncabbie a couple of bucks over his customary ten percent and bummed a\ncigarette off him, realizing that Mimi had asked him for a butt but\nnever returned the pack.\n\nHe puffed and shook his head and stared up the street at the distant\nlights of College Street, then turned back to his porch.\n\n\"Hello, Albert,\" two voices said in unison, speaking from the shadows on\nhis porch.\n\n\"Jesus,\" he said, and hit the remote on his keyring that switched on the\nporch light. It was his brother Edward, the eldest of the nesting dolls,\nthe bark of their trinity, coarse and tough and hollow. He was even\nfatter than he'd been as a little boy, fat enough that his arms and legs\nappeared vestigial and unjointed. He struggled, panting, to his tiny\nfeet -- feet like undersized exclamation points beneath the tapered Oh\nof his body. His face, though doughy, had not gone to undefined\nsoftness. Rather, every feature had acquired its own rolls of fat, rolls\nthat warred with one another to define his appearance -- nose and\ncheekbones and brow and lips all grotesque and inflated and blubbery.\n\n\"Eugene,\" Alan said. \"It's been a very long time.\"\n\nEdward cocked his head. \"It has, indeed, big brother. I've got bad\nnews.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nEdward leaned to the left, the top half of his body tipping over\ncompletely, splitting at his narrow leather belt, so that his trunk,\nneck, and head hung upside down beside his short, cylindrical legs and\ntiny feet.\n\nInside of him was Frederick, the perennial middle child. Frederick\nplanted his palms on the dry, smooth edges of his older brother's waist\nand levered himself up, stepping out of Ed's legs with the unconscious\nease of a lifetime's practice. \"It's good to see you, Andy,\" he said. He\nwas pale and wore his habitual owlish expression of surprise at seeing\nthe world without looking through his older brother's eyes.\n\n\"It's nice to see you, too, Frederick,\" Alan said. He'd always gotten\nalong with Frederick, always liked his ability to play peacemaker and to\nlend a listening ear.\n\nFrederick helped Edward upright, methodically circumnavigating his huge\nbelly, retucking his grimy white shirt. Then he hitched up his\nsweatshirt over the hairy pale expanse of his own belly and tipped to\none side.\n\nAlan had been expecting to see Gregory, the core, but instead, there was\nnothing inside Frederick. The Gregory-shaped void was empty. Frederick\nrighted himself and hitched up his belt.\n\n\"We think he's dead,\" Edward said, his rubbery features distorted into a\nGreek tragedy mask. \"We think that Doug killed him.\" He pinwheeled his\nround arms and then clapped his hands to his face, sobbing. Frederick\nput a hand on his arm. He, too, was crying.\n\n#\n\nOnce upon a time, Alan's mother gave birth to three sons in three\nmonths. Birthing sons was hardly extraordinary -- before these three\ncame along, she'd already had four others. But the interval, well, that\nwas unusual.\n\nAs the eldest, Alan was the first to recognize the early signs of her\npregnancy. The laundry loads of diapers and play clothes he fed into her\nbelly unbalanced more often, and her spin cycle became almost\nlackadaisical, so the garments had to hang on the line for days before\nthey stiffened and dried completely. Alan liked to sit with his back\nagainst his mother's hard enamel side while she rocked and gurgled and\nchurned. It comforted him.\n\nThe details of her conception were always mysterious to Alan. He'd been\nwalking down into town to attend day school for five years, and he'd\nlearned all about the birds and the bees, and he thought that maybe his\nfather -- the mountain -- impregnated his mother by means of some\nstrange pollen carried on the gusts of winds from his deep and gloomy\ncaves. There was a gnome, too, who made sure that the long hose that led\nfrom Alan's mother's back to the spring pool in his father's belly\nremained clear and unfouled, and sometimes Alan wondered if the gnome\ndove for his father's seed and fed it up his mother's intake. Alan's\nlife was full of mysteries, and he'd long since learned to keep his\nmouth shut about his home life when he was at school.\n\nHe attended all three births, along with the smaller kids -- Bill and\nDonald (Charlie, the island, was still small enough to float in the\nmiddle of their father's heart-pool) -- waiting on tenterhooks for his\nmother's painful off-balance spin cycle to spend itself before\nreverently opening the round glass door and removing the infant within.\n\nEdward was fat, even for a baby. He looked like an elongated soccer ball\nwith a smaller ball on top. He cried healthily, though, and gave hearty\nsuck to their mother's exhaust valve once Alan had cleaned the soap suds\nand fabric softener residue from his little body. His father gusted\nproud, warm, blustery winds over them and their little domestic scene.\n\nAlan noticed that little Edward, for all his girth, was very light, and\nwondered if the baby was full of helium or some other airy\nsubstance. Certainly he hardly appeared to be full of *baby*, since\neverything he ate and drank passed through him in a matter of seconds,\nhardly digested at all. Alan had to go into town twice to buy new\ntwelve-pound boxes of clean white shop rags to clean up the slime trail\nthe baby left behind him. Drew, at three, seemed to take a perverse\ndelight in the scummy water, spreading it around the cave as much as\npossible. The grove in front of the cave mouth was booby trapped with\nclothesline upon clothesline, all hung with diapers and rags drying out\nin the early spring sunlight.\n\nThirty days later, Alan came home from school to find the younger kids\nsurrounding his mother as she rocked from side to side, actually popping\nfree of the grooves her small metal feet had worn in the cave floor over\nthe years.\n\nTwo babies in thirty days! Such a thing was unheard of in their father's\ncave. Edward, normally a sweet-tempered baby, howled long screams that\nresonated through Alan's milk teeth and made his testicles shrivel up\ninto hard stones. Alan knew his mother liked to be left alone when she\nwas in labor, but he couldn't just stand there and watch her shake and\nshiver.\n\nHe went to her and pressed his palms to her top, tried to soothe and\nrestrain her. Bill, the second eldest and still only four years old,\nfollowed suit. Edward's screams grew even louder, loud and hoarse and\nutterly terrified, echoing off their father's walls and back to\nthem. Soon Alan was sobbing, too, biting his lip to keep the sounds\ninside, and so were the other children. Dillon wrinkled his brow and\nscreamed a high-pitched wail that could have cut glass.\n\nAlan's mother rocked harder, and her exhaust hose dislodged itself. A\nhigh-pressure jet of cold, soapy water spurted from her back parts,\npainting the cave wall with suds. Edward crawled into the puddle it\nformed and scooped small handsful of the liquid into his mouth between\nhowls.\n\nAnd then, it stopped. His mother stopped rocking, stopped shaking. The\nstream trailed off into a trickle. Alan stopped crying, and soon the\nsmaller kids followed suit, even Edward. The echoes continued for a\nmoment, and then they, too, stopped. The silence was as startling -- and\nnearly as unbearable -- as the cacophony had been.\n\nWith a trembling hand, Alan opened his mother's door and extracted\nlittle Frederick. The baby was small and cyanotic blue. Alan tipped the\nbaby over and shook him gently, and the baby vomited up a fantastic\nquantity of wash water, a prodigious stream that soaked the front of\nAlan's school trousers and his worn brown loafers. Finally it ended, and\nthe baby let out a healthy yowl. Alan shifted the infant to one arm and\ngingerly reconnected the exhaust hose and set the baby down alongside of\nits end. The baby wouldn't suck, though.\n\nAcross the cave, from his soggy seat in the puddle of waste water,\nEdward watched the new baby with curious eyes. He crawled across the\nfloor and nuzzled his brother with his high forehead. Frederick squirmed\nand fussed, and Edward shoved him to one side and sucked. His little\ndiaper dripped as the liquid passed directly through him.\n\nAlan patiently picked dripping Edward up and put him over one shoulder,\nand gave Frederick the tube to suck. Frederick gummed at the hose's end,\nthen fussed some more, whimpering. Edward squirmed in his arms, nearly\nplummeting to the hard stone floor.\n\n\"Billy,\" Alan said to the solemn little boy, who nodded. \"Can you take\ncare of Edward for a little while? I need to clean up.\" Billy nodded\nagain and held out his pudgy arms. Alan grabbed some clean shop rags and\nbriskly wiped Frederick down, then laid another across Billy's shoulder\nand set Edward down. The baby promptly set to snoring. Danny started\nscreaming again, with no provocation, and Alan took two swift steps to\nbridge the distance between them and smacked the child hard enough to\nstun him silent.\n\nAlan grabbed a mop and bucket and sloshed the puddles into the drainage\ngroove where his mother's waste water usually ran, out the cave mouth\nand into a stand of choking mountain-grass that fed greedily and thrived\nriotous in the phosphates from the detergent.\n\nFrederick did not eat for thirty days, and during that time he grew so\nthin that he appeared to shrivel like a raisin, going hard and folded in\nupon himself. Alan spent hours patiently spooning sudsy water into his\nlittle pink mouth, but the baby wouldn't swallow, just spat it out and\nwhimpered and fussed. Edward liked to twine around Alan's feet like a\ncat as he joggled and spooned and fretted over Frederick. It was all\nAlan could do not to go completely mad, but he held it together, though\nhis grades slipped.\n\nHis mother vibrated nervously, and his father's winds grew so unruly\nthat two of the golems came around to the cave to make their slow,\npeevish complaints. Alan shoved a baby into each of their arms and\nseriously lost his shit upon them, screaming himself hoarse at them\nwhile hanging more diapers, more rags, more clothes on the line, tossing\nhis unfinished homework in their faces.\n\nBut on the thirtieth day, his mother went into labor again -- a labor so\nfrenzied that it dislodged a stalactite and sent it crashing and\nchundering to the cave floor in a fractious shivering of flinders. Alan\ntook a chip in the neck and it opened up a small cut that nevertheless\nbled copiously and ruined, *ruined* his favorite T-shirt, with Snoopy\nsitting atop his doghouse in an aviator's helmet, firing an imaginary\nmachine gun at the cursed Red Baron.\n\nThat was nearly the final straw for Alan, but he held fast and waited\nfor the labor to pass and finally unlatched the door and extracted\nlittle George, a peanut of a child, a lima-bean infant, curled and fetal\nand eerily quiet. He set the little half-baby down by the exhaust hose,\nwhere he'd put shriveled Frederick in a hopeless hope that the baby\nwould suck, would ingest, finally.\n\nAnd ingest Frederick did. His dry and desiccated jaw swung open like a\nsnake's, unhinged and spread wide, and he *swallowed* little George, ate\nhim up in three convulsive swallows, the new baby making Frederick's\nbelly swell like a balloon. Alan swallowed panic, seized Frederick by\nthe heels, and shook him upside down. \"Spit him out,\" Alan cried, \"Spat\nhim free!\"\n\nBut Frederick kept his lips stubbornly together, and Alan tired of the\nterrible business and set the boy with the newest brother within down on\na pile of hay he'd brought in to soak up some of Edward's continuous\nexcretions. Alan put his hands over his face and sobbed, because he'd\nfailed his responsibilities as eldest of their family and there was no\none he could tell his woes to.\n\nThe sound of baby giggles stopped his crying. Edward had belly-crawled\nto Frederick's side and he was eating *him*, jaw unhinged and gorge\nworking. He was up to Frederick's little bottom, dehydrated to a\nleathery baby-jerky, and then he was past, swallowing the arms and the\nchin and the *head*, the giggling, smiling head, the laughing head that\nhad done nothing but whine and fuss since Alan had cleared it of its\nvolume of detergenty water, fresh from their mother's belly.\n\nAnd then Frederick was gone. Horrified, Alan rushed over and picked up\nEdward -- now as heavy as a cannonball -- and pried his mouth open,\nstaring down his gullet, staring down into *another mouth*, Frederick's\nmouth, which gaped open, revealing a *third* mouth, George's. The\nsmallest mouth twisted and opened, then shut. Edward squirmed furiously\nand Alan nearly fumbled him. He set the baby down in the straw and\nwatched him crawl across to their mother, where he sucked\nhungrily. Automatically, Alan gathered up an armload of rags and made\nready to wipe up the stream that Edward would soon be ejecting.\n\nBut no stream came. The baby fed and fed, and let out a deep burp in\nthree-part harmony, spat up a little, and drank some more. Somehow,\nFrederick and George were in there feeding, too. Alan waited patiently\nfor Edward to finish feeding, then put him over his shoulder and joggled\nhim until he burped up, then bedded him down in his little rough-hewn\ncrib -- the crib that the golems had carved for Alan when he was born --\ncleaned the cave, and cried again, leaned up against their mother.\n\n#\n\nFrederick huddled in on himself, half behind Edward on the porch,\nhabitually phobic of open spaces. Alan took his hand and then embraced\nhim. He smelled of Edward's clammy guts and of sweat.\n\n\"Are you two hungry?\" Alan asked.\n\nEdward grimaced. \"Of course we're hungry, but without George there's\nnothing we can do about it, is there?\"\n\nAlan shook his head. \"How long has he been gone?\"\n\n\"Three weeks,\" Edward whispered. \"I'm so hungry, Alan.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\"\n\nFrederick wobbled on his feet, then leaned heavily on Edward. \"I need to\nsit down,\" he said.\n\nAlan fumbled for his keys and let them into the house, where they\nsettled into the corners of his old overstuffed horsehide sofa. He\ndialed up the wall sconces to a dim, homey lighting, solicitous of\nFrederick's sensitive eyes. He took an Apollo 8 Jim Beam decanter full\nof stunning Irish whiskey off the sideboard and poured himself a finger\nof it, not offering any to his brothers.\n\n\"Now, how did it happen?\"\n\n\"He wanted to speak to Dad,\" Frederick said. \"He climbed out of me and\nwandered down through the tunnels into the spring pool. The goblin told\nus that he took off his clothes and waded in and started whispering.\"\nLike most of the boys, George had believed that their father was most\naware in his very middle, where he could direct the echoes of the\nwater's rippling, shape them into words and phrases in the hollow of the\ngreat cavern.\n\n\"So the goblin saw it happen?\"\n\n\"No,\" Frederick said, and Edward began to cry again. \"No. George asked\nhim for some privacy, and so he went a little way up the tunnel. He\nwaited and waited, but George didn't come back. He called out, but\nGeorge didn't answer. When he went to look for him, he was gone. His\nclothes were gone. All that he could find was this.\" He scrabbled to fit\nhis chubby hand into his jacket's pocket, then fished out a little black\npebble. Alan took it and saw that it wasn't a pebble, it was a\nrotted-out and dried-up fingertip, pierced with unbent paperclip wire.\n\n\"It's Dave's, isn't it?\" Edward said.\n\n\"I think so,\" Alan said. Dave used to spend hours wiring his dropped-off\nparts back onto his body, gluing his teeth back into his head. \"Jesus.\"\n\n\"We're going to die, aren't we?\" Frederick said. \"We're going to starve\nto death.\"\n\nEdward held his pudgy hands one on top of the other in his lap and began\nto rock back and forth. \"We'll be okay,\" he lied.\n\n\"Did anyone see Dave?\" Alan asked.\n\n\"No,\" Frederick said. \"We asked the golems, we asked Dad, we asked the\ngoblin, but no one saw him. No one's seen him for years.\"\n\nAlan thought for a moment about how to ask his next question. \"Did you\nlook in the pool? On the bottom?\"\n\n\"*He's not there!*\" Edward said. \"We looked there. We looked all around\nDad. We looked in town. Alan, they're both gone.\"\n\nAlan felt a sear of acid jet up esophagus. \"I don't know what to do,\" he\nsaid. \"I don't know where to look. Frederick, can't you, I don't know,\n*stuff* yourself with something? So you can eat?\"\n\n\"We tried,\" Edward said. \"We tried rags and sawdust and clay and bread\nand they didn't work. I thought that maybe we could get a *child* and\nput him inside, maybe, but God, Albert, I don't want to do that, it's\nthe kind of thing Dan would do.\"\n\nAlan stared at the softly glowing wood floors, reflecting highlights\nfrom the soft lighting. He rubbed his stocking toes over the waxy finish\nand felt its shine. \"Don't do that, okay?\" he said. \"I'll think of\nsomething. Let me sleep on it. Do you want to sleep here? I can make up\nthe sofa.\"\n\n\"Thanks, big brother,\" Edward said. \"Thanks.\"\n\n#\n\nAlan walked past his study, past the tableau of laptop and desk and\nchair, felt the pull of the story, and kept going, pulling his housecoat\ntighter around himself. The summer morning was already hotting up, and\nthe air in the house had a sticky, dewy feel.\n\nHe found Edward sitting on the sofa, with the sheets and pillowcases\nfolded neatly next to him.\n\n\"I set out a couple of towels for you in the second-floor bathroom and\nfound an extra toothbrush,\" Alan said. \"If you want them.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Edward said, echoing in his empty chest. The thick rolls of\nhis face were contorted into a caricature of sorrow.\n\n\"Where's Frederick?\" Alan asked.\n\n\"Gone!\" Edward said, and broke into spasms of sobbing. \"He's gone he's\ngone he's gone, I woke up and he was gone.\"\n\nAlan shifted the folded linens to the floor and sat next to\nEdward. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"You *know* what happened, Alan,\" Edward said. \"You know as well as I\ndo! Dave took him in the night. He followed us here and he came in the\nnight and stole him away.\"\n\n\"You don't know that,\" Alan said, softly stroking Edward's greasy fringe\nof hair. \"He could have wandered out for a walk or something.\"\n\n\"Of course I know it!\" Edward yelled, his voice booming in the hollow of\nhis great chest. \"Look!\" He handed Alan a small, desiccated lump, like a\nblack bean pierced with a paperclip wire.\n\n\"You showed me this yesterday --\" Alan said.\n\n\"It's from a *different finger*!\" Edward said, and he buried his face in\nAlan's shoulder, sobbing uncontrollably.\n\n\"Have you looked for him?\" Alan asked.\n\n\"I've been waiting for you to get up. I don't want to go out alone.\"\n\n\"We'll look together,\" Alan said. He got a pair of shorts and a T-shirt,\nshoved his feet into Birkenstocks, and led Edward out the door.\n\nThe previous night's humidity had thickened to a gray cloudy soup, swift\nthunderheads coming in from all sides. The foot traffic was reduced to\nsparse, fast-moving umbrellas, people rushing for shelter before the\ndeluge. Ozone crackled in the air and thunder roiled seemingly up from\nthe ground, deep and sickening.\n\nThey started with a circuit of the house, looking for footprints, body\nparts. He found a shred of torn gray thrift-store shirt, caught on a\nrose bramble near the front of his walk. It smelled of the homey warmth\nof Edward's innards, and had a few of Frederick's short, curly hairs\nstuck to it. Alan showed it to Edward, then folded it into the change\npocket of his wallet.\n\nThey walked the length of the sidewalk, crossed Wales, and began to\nslowly cross the little park. Edward circumnavigated the little cement\nwading pool, tracing the political runes left behind by the Market's\ncheerful anarchist taggers, painfully bent almost double at his enormous\nwaist.\n\n\"What are we looking for, Alan?\"\n\n\"Footprints. Finger bones. Clues.\"\n\nEdward puffed back to the bench and sat down, tears streaming down his\nface. \"I'm so *hungry*,\" he said.\n\nAlan, crawling around the torn sod left when someone had dragged one of\nthe picnic tables, contained his frustration. \"If we can find Daniel, we\ncan get Frederick and George back, okay?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Edward snuffled.\n\nThe next time Alan looked up, Edward had taken off his scuffed shoes and\ngrimy-gray socks, rolled up the cuffs of his tent-sized pants, and was\nwading through the little pool, piggy eyes cast downward.\n\n\"Good idea,\" Alan called, and turned to the sandbox.\n\nA moment later, there was a booming yelp, almost lost in the roll of\nthunder, and when Alan turned about, Edward was gone.\n\nAlan kicked off his Birks and splashed up to the hems of his shorts in\nthe wading pool. In the pool's center, the round fountainhead was a\ntwisted wreck, the concrete crumbled and the dry steel and brass\nfixtures contorted and ruptured. They had long streaks of abraded skin,\ntorn shirt, and blood on them, leading down into the guts of the\nfountain.\n\nCautiously, Alan leaned over, looking well down the dark tunnel that had\nbeen scraped out of the concrete centerpiece. The thin gray light showed\nhim the rough walls, chipped out with some kind of sharp tool. \"Edward?\"\nhe called. His voice did not echo or bounce back to him.\n\nTentatively, he reached down the tunnel, bending at the waist over the\nrough lip of the former fountain. Deep he reached and reached and\nreached, and as his fingertips hit loose dirt, he leaned farther in and\ngroped blindly, digging his hands into the plug of soil that had been\nshoveled into the tunnel's bend a few feet below the surface. He\nstraightened up and climbed in, sinking to the waist, and tried to kick\nthe dirt out of the way, but it wouldn't give -- the tunnel had caved in\nbehind the plug of earth.\n\nHe clambered out, feeling the first fat drops of rain on his bare\nforearms and the crown of his head. *A shovel*. There was one in the\nlittle coach house in the back of his place, behind the collapsed boxes\nand the bicycle pump. As he ran across the street, he saw Krishna,\nsitting on his porch, watching him with a hint of a smile.\n\n\"Lost another one, huh?\" he said. He looked as if he'd been awake all\nnight, now hovering on the brink of sleepiness and wiredness. A roll of\nthunder crashed and a sheet of rain hurtled out of the sky.\n\nAlan never thought of himself as a violent person. Even when he'd had to\nthrow the occasional troublemaker out of his shops, he'd done so with an\nalmost cordial force. Now, though, he trembled and yearned to take\nKrishna by the throat and ram his head, face first, into the column that\nheld up his front porch, again and again, until his fingers were slick\nwith the blood from Krishna's shattered nose.\n\nAlan hurried past him, his shoulders and fists clenched. Krishna\nchuckled nastily and Alan thought he knew who got the job of sawing off\nMimi's wings when they grew too long, and thought, too, that Krishna\nmust relish the task.\n\n\"Where you going?\" Krishna called.\n\nAlan fumbled with his keyring, desperate to get in and get the keys to\nthe coach house and to fetch the shovel before the new tunnels under the\npark collapsed.\n\n\"You're too late, you know,\" Krishna continued. \"You might as well give\nup. Too late, too late!\"\n\nAlan whirled and shrieked, a wordless, contorted war cry, a sound from\nhis bestial guts. As his eyes swam back into focus, he saw Mimi standing\nbeside Krishna, barefoot in a faded housecoat. Her eyes were very wide,\nand as she turned away from him, he saw that her stubby wings were\nsplayed as wide as they'd go, forming a tent in her robe that pulled it\nup above her knees. Alan bit down and clamped his lips together and\nfound his keys. He tracked mud over the polished floors and the ancient,\nthreadbare Persian rugs as he ran to the kitchen, snatching the\ncoach-house keys from their hook over the sink.\n\nHe ran back across the street to the little park, clutching his\nshovel. He jammed his head into the centerpiece and tried to see which\nway the tunnel had curved off when it turned, but it was too dark, the\ndirt too loose. He pulled himself out and took the shovel in his hands\nlike a spear and stabbed it into the concrete bed of the wading pool,\nlistening for a hollowness in the returning sound like a man thudding\nfor a stud under drywall.\n\nThe white noise of the rain was too high, the rolling thunder too\nsteady. His chest heaved and his tears mingled with the rain streaking\ndown his face as he stabbed, again and again, at the pool's bottom. His\nmind was scrambled and saturated, his vision clouded with the humid mist\nrising off his exertion-heated chest and the raindrops caught in his\neyelashes.\n\nHe splashed out of the wading pool and took the shovel to the sod of the\npark's lawn, picking an arbitrary spot and digging inefficiently and\nhysterically, the bent shovel tip twisting with each stroke.\n\nSuddenly strong hands were on his shoulders, another set prizing the\nshovel from his hands. He looked up and blinked his eyes clear, looking\ninto the face of two young Asian police officers. They were bulky from\nthe Kevlar vests they wore under their rain slickers, with kind and\nexasperated expressions on their faces.\n\n\"Sir,\" the one holding the shovel said, \"what are you doing?\"\n\nAlan breathed himself into a semblance of composure. \"I...\" he started,\nthen trailed off. Krishna was watching from his porch, grinning\nferociously, holding a cordless phone.\n\nThe creature that had howled at Krishna before scrambled for purchase in\nAlan's chest. Alan averted his eyes from Krishna's shit-eating,\n911-calling grin. He focused on the cap of the officer in front of him,\nshrouded in a clear plastic shower cap to keep its crown dry. \"I'm\nsorry,\" he said. \"It was a -- a dog. A stray, or maybe a runaway. A\nlittle Scottie dog, it jumped down the center of the fountain there and\ndisappeared. I looked down and thought it had found a tunnel that caved\nin on it.\"\n\nThe officer peered at him from under the brim of his hat, dubiousness\nwrit plain on his young, good-looking face. \"A tunnel?\"\n\nAlan wiped the rain from his eyes, tried to regain his composure, tried\nto find his charm. It wasn't to be found. Instead, every time he reached\nfor something witty and calming, he saw the streaks of blood and torn\nclothing, dark on the loose soil of the fountain's center, and no sooner\nhad he dispelled those images than they were replaced with Krishna,\nsneering, saying, \"Lost another one, huh?\" He trembled and swallowed a\nsob.\n\n\"I think I need to sit down,\" he said, as calmly as he could, and he\nsank slowly to his knees. The hands on his biceps let him descend.\n\n\"Sir, do you live nearby?\" one of the cops asked, close in to his\near. He nodded into his hands, which he'd brought up to cover his face.\n\n\"Across the street,\" he said. They helped him to his feet and supported\nhim as he tottered, weak and heaving, to his porch. Krishna was gone\nonce they got there.\n\nThe cops helped him shuck his drenched shoes and socks and put him down\non the overstuffed horsehide sofa. Alan recovered himself with an effort\nof will and gave them his ID.\n\n\"I'm sorry, you must think I'm an absolute lunatic,\" he said, shivering\nin his wet clothes.\n\n\"Sir,\" the cop who'd taken the shovel from him said, \"we see absolute\nlunatics every day. I think you're just a little upset. We all go a\nlittle nuts from time to time.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said. \"Yeah. A little nuts. I had a long night last\nnight. Family problems.\"\n\nThe cops shifted their weight, showering the floor with raindrops that\nbeaded on the finish.\n\n\"Are you going to be all right on your own? We can call someone if you'd\nlike.\"\n\n\"No,\" Alan said, pasting on a weak smile. \"No, that's all right. I'll be\nfine. I'm going to change into some dry clothes and clean up and, oh, I\ndon't know, get some sleep. I think I could use some sleep.\"\n\n\"That sounds like an excellent idea,\" the cop who'd taken the shovel\nsaid. He looked around at the bookcases. \"You've read all of these?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Naw,\" Alan said, falling into the rote response from his proprietorship\nof the bookstore. \"What's the point of a bunch of books you've already\nread?\" The joke reminded him of better times and he smiled a genuine\nsmile.\n\n#\n\nThough the stinging hot shower revived him somewhat, he kept quickening\ninto panic at the thought of David creeping into his house in the night,\nstumping in on desiccated black child-legs, snaggled rictus under\nmummified lips.\n\nHe spooked at imagined noises and thudding rain and the dry creaking of\nthe old house as he toweled off and dressed.\n\nThere was no phone in the mountain, no way to speak to his remaining\nbrothers, the golems, his parents. He balled his fists and stood in the\ncenter of his bedroom, shaking with impotent worry.\n\nDavid. None of them had liked David very much. Billy, the\nfortune-teller, had been born with a quiet wisdom, an eerie solemnity\nthat had made him easy for the young Alan to care for. Carlos, the\nisland, had crawled out of their mother's womb and pulled himself to the\ncave mouth and up the face of their father, lying there for ten years,\naccreting until he was ready to push off on his own.\n\nBut Daniel, Daniel had been a hateful child from the day he was born. He\nwas colicky, and his screams echoed through their father's caverns. He\nscreamed from the moment he emerged and Alan tipped him over and toweled\nhim gently dry and he didn't stop for an entire year. Alan stopped being\nable to tell day from night, lost track of the weeks and months. He'd\ndeveloped a taste for food, real people food, that he'd buy in town at\nthe Loblaws Superstore, but he couldn't leave Davey alone in the cave,\nand he certainly couldn't carry the howling, shitting, puking, pissing,\nfilthy baby into town with him.\n\nSo they ate what the golems brought them: sweet grasses, soft berries,\nfrozen winter fruit dug from the base of the orchards in town, blind\nwinter fish from the streams. They drank snowmelt and ate pine cones and\nthe baby Davey cried and cried until Alan couldn't remember what it was\nto live in a world of words and conversations and thought and\nreflection.\n\nNo one knew what to do about Davey. Their father blew warm winds scented\nwith coal dust and loam to calm him, but still Davey cried. Their mother\nrocked him on her gentlest spin cycle, but still Davey cried. Alan\nwalked down the slope to Carl's landmass, growing with the dust and\nrains and snow, and set him down on the soft grass and earth there, but\nstill Davey cried, and Carlos inched farther and farther toward the\nSt. Lawrence seaway, sluggishly making his way out to the ocean and as\nfar away from the baby as possible.\n\nAfter his first birthday, David started taking breaks from his\nscreaming, learning to crawl and then totter, becoming a holy terror. If\nAlan left his schoolbooks within reach of the boy, they'd be reduced to\nshreds of damp mulch in minutes. By the time he was two, his head was\nexactly at Alan's crotch height and he'd greet his brother on his return\nfrom school by charging at full speed into Alan's nuts, propelled at\nunlikely speed on his thin legs.\n\nAt three, he took to butchering animals -- the rabbits that little Bill\nkept in stacked hutches outside of the cave mouth went first. Billy\nrushed home from his grade-two class, eyes crazed with precognition, and\nfound David methodically wringing the animals' necks and then slicing\nthem open with a bit of sharpened chert. Billy had showed David how to\nknap flint and chert the week before, after seeing a filmstrip about it\nin class. He kicked the makeshift knife out of Davey's hand, breaking\nhis thumb with the toe of the hard leather shoes the golems had made for\nhim, and left Davey to bawl in the cave while Billy dignified his pets'\ncorpses, putting their entrails back inside their bodies and wrapping\nthem in shrouds made from old diapers. Alan helped him bury them, and\nthen found Davey and taped his thumb to his hand and spanked him until\nhis arm was too tired to deal out one more wallop.\n\nAlan made his way down to the living room, the floor streaked with mud\nand water. He went into the kitchen and filled a bucket with soapy water\nand gathered up an armload of rags from the rag bag. Methodically, he\ncleaned away the mud. He turned his sopping shoes on end over the grate\nand dialed the thermostat higher. He made himself a bowl of granola and\na cup of coffee and sat down at his old wooden kitchen table and ate\nmindlessly, then washed the dishes and put them in the drying rack.\n\nHe'd have to go speak to Krishna.\n\n#\n\nNatalie answered the door in a pretty sun dress, combat boots, and a\nbaseball hat. She eyed him warily.\n\n\"I'd like to speak to Krishna,\" Alan said from under the hood of his\nponcho.\n\nThere was an awkward silence. Finally, Natalie said, \"He's not home.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" Alan said. \"And it's urgent, and I'm not in the\nmood to play around. Can you get Krishna for me, Natalie?\"\n\n\"I told you,\" she said, not meeting his eyes, \"he's not here.\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" Alan said in his boss voice, his\nmore-in-anger-than-in-sorrow voice. \"Get him, Natalie. You don't need to\nbe in the middle of this -- it's not right for him to ask you to. Get\nhim.\"\n\nNatalie closed the door and he heard the deadbolt turn. *Is she going to\nfetch him, or is she locking me out?*\n\nHe was on the verge of hammering the buzzer again, but he got his\nanswer. Krishna opened the door and stepped onto the dripping porch,\nbulling Alan out with his chest.\n\nHe smiled grimly at Alan and made a well-go-on gesture.\n\n\"What did you see?\" Alan said, his voice tight but under control.\n\n\"Saw you and that fat guy,\" Krishna said. \"Saw you rooting around in the\npark. Saw him disappear down the fountain.\"\n\n\"He's my brother,\" Alan said.\n\n\"So what, he ain't heavy? He's fat, but I expect there's a reason for\nthat. I've seen your kind before, Adam. I don't like you, and I don't\nowe you any favors.\" He turned and reached for the screen door.\n\n\"No,\" Alan said, taking him by the wrist, squeezing harder than was\nnecessary. \"Not yet. You said, 'Lost another one.' What other one,\nKrishna? What else did you see?\"\n\nKrishna gnawed on his neatly trimmed soul patch. \"Let go of me, Andrew,\"\nhe said, almost too softly to be heard over the rain.\n\n\"Tell me what you saw,\" Alan said. \"Tell me, and I'll let you go.\" His\nother hand balled into a fist. \"Goddammit, *tell me*!\" Alan yelled, and\ntwisted Krishna's arm behind his back.\n\n\"I called the cops,\" Krishna said. \"I called them again and they're on\ntheir way. Let me go, freak show.\"\n\n\"I don't like you, either, Krishna,\" Alan said, twisting the arm\nhigher. He let go suddenly, then stumbled back as Krishna scraped the\nheel of his motorcycle boot down his shin and hammered it into the top\nof his foot.\n\nHe dropped to one knee and grabbed his foot while Krishna slipped into\nthe house and shot the lock. Then he hobbled home as quickly as he\ncould. He tried to pace off the ache in his foot, but the throbbing got\nworse, so he made himself a drippy ice pack and sat on the sofa in the\nimmaculate living room and rocked back and forth, holding the ice to his\nbare foot.\n\n#\n\nAt five, Davey graduated from torturing animals to beating up on smaller\nchildren. Alan took him down to the school on the day after Labor Day,\nto sign him up for kindergarten. He was wearing his stiff new blue jeans\nand sneakers, his knapsack stuffed with fresh binders and\npencils. Finding out about these things had been Alan's first experience\nwith the wide world, a kindergartner sizing up his surroundings at speed\nso that he could try to fit in. David was a cute kid and had the benefit\nof Alan's experience. He had a foxy little face and shaggy blond hair,\nall clever smiles and awkward winks, and for all that he was still a\nmonster.\n\nThey came and got Alan twenty minutes after classes started, when his\nnew home-room teacher was still briefing them on the rules and\nregulations for junior high students. He was painfully aware of all the\neyes on his back as he followed the office lady out of the portable and\ninto the old school building where the kindergarten and the\nadministration was housed.\n\n\"We need to reach your parents,\" the office lady said, once they were\nalone in the empty hallways of the old building.\n\n\"You can't,\" Alan said. \"They don't have a phone.\"\n\n\"Then we can drive out to see them,\" the office lady said. She smelled\nof artificial floral scent and Ivory soap, like the female hygiene aisle\nat the drugstore.\n\n\"Mom's still real sick,\" Alan said, sticking to his traditional story.\n\n\"Your father, then,\" the office lady said. He'd had variations on this\nconversation with every office lady at the school, and he knew he'd win\nit in the end. Meantime, what did they want?\n\n\"My dad's, you know, gone,\" he said. \"Since I was a little kid.\" That\nline always got the office ladies, \"since I was a little kid,\" made them\nwant to write it down for their family Christmas newsletters.\n\nThe office lady smiled a powdery smile and put her hand on his\nshoulder. \"All right, Alan, come with me.\"\n\nDavey was sitting on the dusty sofa in the vice principal's office. He\npunched the sofa cushion rhythmically. \"Alan,\" he said when the office\nlady led him in.\n\n\"Hi, Dave,\" Alan said. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"They're stupid here. I hate them.\" He gave the sofa a particularly\nvicious punch.\n\n\"I'll get Mr Davenport,\" the office lady said, and closed the door\nbehind her.\n\n\"What did you do?\" Alan asked.\n\n\"She wouldn't let me play!\" David said, glaring at him.\n\n\"Who wouldn't?\"\n\n\"A girl! She had the blocks and I wanted to play with them and she\nwouldn't let me!\"\n\n\"What did you hit her with?\" Alan asked, dreading the answer.\n\n\"A block,\" David said, suddenly and murderously cheerful. \"I hit her in\nthe eye!\"\n\nAlan groaned. The door opened and the vice principal, Mr. Davenport,\ncame in and sat behind his desk. He was the punishment man, the one that\nno one wanted to be sent in to see.\n\n\"Hello, Alan,\" he said gravely. Alan hadn't ever been personally called\nbefore Mr. Davenport, but Billy got into some spot of precognitive\ntrouble from time to time, rushing out of class to stop some disaster at\nhome or somewhere else in the school. Mr. Davenport knew that Alan was a\nstraight arrow, not someone he'd ever need to personally take an\ninterest in.\n\nHe crouched down next to Darren, hitching up his slacks. \"You must be\nDavid,\" he said, ducking down low to meet Davey's downcast gaze.\n\nDavey punched the sofa.\n\n\"I'm Mr. Davenport,\" he said, and extended a hand with a big class ring\non it and a smaller wedding band.\n\nDavey kicked him in the nose, and the vice principal toppled over\nbackward, whacking his head on the sharp corner of his desk. He tumbled\nover onto his side and clutched his head. \"Mother*fucker*!\" he gasped,\nand Davey giggled maniacally.\n\nAlan grabbed Davey's wrist and bent his arm behind his back, shoving him\nacross his knee. He swatted the little boy on the ass as hard as he\ncould, three times. \"Don't you ever --\" Alan began.\n\nThe vice principal sat up, still clutching his head. \"That's enough!\" he\nsaid, catching Alan's arm.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Alan said. \"And David's sorry, too, right?\" He glared at David.\n\n\"You're a stupid mother*fucker*!\" David said, and squirmed off of Alan's\nlap.\n\nThe vice principal's lips tightened. \"Alan,\" he said quietly, \"take your\nbrother into the hallway. I am going to write a note that your mother\nwill have to sign before David comes back to school, after his two-week\nsuspension.\"\n\nDavid glared at them each in turn. \"I'm not coming back to this\nmother*fucker* place!\" he said.\n\nHe didn't.\n\n#\n\nThe rain let up by afternoon, leaving a crystalline, fresh-mown air\nhanging over the Market.\n\nAndrew sat in his office by his laptop and watched the sun come out. He\nneeded to find Ed, needed to find Frank, needed to find Grant, but he\nwas out of practice when it came to the ways of the mountain and its\nsons. Whenever he tried to imagine a thing to do next, his mind spun and\nthe worldless howling thing inside him stirred. The more he tried to\nremember what it was like to be a son of the mountain, the more he felt\nsomething he'd worked very hard for, his delicate normalcy, slipping\naway.\n\nSo he put his soaked clothes in the dryer, clamped his laptop under his\narm, and went out. He moped around the park and the fountain, but the\nstroller moms whose tots were splashing in the wading pool gave him\nsufficient dirty looks that he walked up to the Greek's, took a table on\nthe patio, and ordered a murderously strong cup of coffee.\n\nHe opened up the screen and rotated around the little caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 table until\nthe screen was in the shade and his wireless card was aligned for best\nreception from the yagi antenna poking out of his back window. He opened\nup a browser and hit MapQuest, then brought up a street-detailed map of\nthe Market. He pasted it into his CAD app and started to mark it up,\nnoting all the different approaches to his house that Davey might take\nthe next time he came. The maps soothed him, made him feel like a part\nof the known world.\n\nAugusta Avenue and Oxford were both out; even after midnight, when the\nstores were all shuttered, there was far too much foot traffic for Davey\nto pass by unnoticed. But the alleys that mazed the back ways were\nideal. Some were fenced off, some were too narrow to pass, but most of\nthem -- he'd tried to navigate them by bicycle once and found himself\nutterly lost. He'd had to turn around slowly until he spotted the CN\nTower and use it to get his bearings.\n\nHe poked at the map, sipping the coffee, then ordering another from the\nGreek's son, who hadn't yet figured out that he was a regular and so\nsneered at his laptop with undisguised contempt. \"Computers, huh?\" he\nsaid. \"Doesn't anyone just read a book anymore?\"\n\n\"I used to own a bookstore,\" Alan said, then held up a finger and moused\nover to his photo album and brought up the thumbnails of his old\nbookstore. \"See?\"\n\nThe Greek's son, thirty with a paunch and sweat-rings under the pits of\nhis white \"The Greek's\" T-shirt, sat down and looked at the photos. \"I\nremember that place, on Harbord Street, right?\"\n\nAlan smiled. \"Yup. We lost the store when they blew up the abortion\nclinic next door,\" he said. \"Insurance paid out, but I wasn't ready to\nstart over with another bookstore.\"\n\nThe Greek's son shook his head. \"Another coffee, right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Alan said.\n\nAlan went back to the map, realigning the laptop for optimal reception\nagain.\n\n\"You got a wireless card in that?\" a young guy at the next table\nasked. He was dressed in Kensington Market crusty-punk chic, tatts and\nfacial piercings, filth-gray bunchoffuckinggoofs tee, cutoffs, and\nsweaty high boots draped with chains.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said. He sighed and closed the map window. He wasn't\ngetting anywhere, anyway.\n\n\"And you get service here? Where's your access point?\" Crusty-punk or\nno, he sounded as nerdy as any of the Web-heads you'd find shopping for\nbargains on CD blanks on College Street.\n\n\"Three blocks that way,\" Alan said, pointing. \"Hanging off my house. The\nnetwork name is 'walesave.'\"\n\n\"Shit, that's you?\" the kid said. \"Goddammit, you're clobbering our\naccess points!\"\n\n\"What access point?\"\n\n\"Access *points*. ParasiteNet.\" He indicated a peeling sticker on the\nlapel of his cut-down leather jacket showing a skull with crossed radio\ntowers underneath it. \"I'm trying to get a mesh-net running though all\nof the Market, and you're hammering me. Jesus, I was ready to rat you\nout to the radio cops at the Canadian Radio and Television\nCommission. Dude, you've got to turn down the freaking *gain* on those\nthings.\"\n\n\"What's a mesh-net?\"\n\nThe kid moved his beer over to Alan's table and sat down. \"Okay, so\npretend that your laptop is the access point. It radiates more or less\nequally in all directions, depending on your antenna characteristics and\nleaving out the RF shadows that microwaves and stucco and cordless\nphones generate.\" He arranged the coffee cup and the beer at equal\ndistances from the laptop, then moved them around to demonstrate the\ncoverage area. \"Right, so what happens if I'm out of range, over *here*\n--\" he put his beer back on his own table -- \"and you want to reach me?\nWell, you could just turn up the gain on your access point, either by\nincreasing the power so that it radiates farther in all directions, or\nby focusing the transmissions so they travel farther in a line of\nsight.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Alan said, sipping his coffee.\n\n\"Right. So both of those approaches suck. If you turn up the power, you\nradiate over everyone else's signal, so if I've got an access point\n*here*\" -- he held his fist between their tables -- \"no one can hear it\nbecause you're drowning it out. It's like you're shouting so loud that\nno one else can carry on a conversation.\"\n\n\"So why don't you just use my network? I want to be able to get online\nanywhere in the Market, but that means that anyone can, right?\"\n\nThe crusty-punk waved his hand dismissively. \"Sure, whatever. But what\nhappens if your network gets shut down? Or if you decide to start\neavesdropping on other people? Or if someone wants to get to the printer\nin her living room? It's no good.\"\n\n\"So, what, you want me to switch to focused antennae?\"\n\n\"That's no good. If you used a focused signal, you're going to have to\nbe perfectly aligned if you're going to talk back to your base, so\nunless you want to provide a connection to one tiny pinpoint somewhere a\ncouple kilometers away, it won't do you any good.\"\n\n\"There's no solution, then? I should just give up?\"\n\nThe crusty-punk held up his hands. \"Hell, no! There's just no\n*centralized* solution. You can't be Superman, blanketing the whole\nworld with wireless using your almighty antennaprick, but so what?\nThat's what mesh networks are for. Check it out.\" He arranged the beer\nand the laptop and the coffee cup so that they were strung out along a\nstraight line. \"Okay, you're the laptop and I'm the coffee cup. We both\nhave a radio and we want to talk to each other.\n\n\"We *could* turn up the gain on our radios so that they can shout loud\nenough to be heard at this distance, but that would drown out this guy\nhere.\" He gestured at the now-empty beer. \"We *could* use a focused\nantenna, but if I move a little bit off the beam\" -- he nudged the\ncoffee cup to one side -- \"we're dead. But there's a third solution.\"\n\n\"We ask the beer to pass messages around?\"\n\n\"Fucking right we do! That's the mesh part. Every station on the network\ngets *two* radios -- one for talking in one direction, the other for\nrelaying in the other direction. The more stations you add, the lower\nthe power on each radio -- and the more pathways you get to carry your\ndata.\"\n\nAlan shook his head.\n\n\"It's a fuckin' mind-blower, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Alan said. \"Sure. But does it work? Don't all those hops between\npoint *a* and point *b* slow down the connection?\"\n\n\"A little, sure. Not so's you'd notice. They don't have to go that far\n-- the farthest any of these signals has to travel is 151 Front Street.\"\n\n\"What's at 151 Front?\"\n\n\"TorIx -- the main network interchange for the whole city! We stick an\nantenna out a window there and downlink it into the cage where UUNet and\nPSINet meet -- voila, instant 11-megabit city-wide freenet!\"\n\n\"Where do you get the money for that?\"\n\n\"Who said anything about money? How much do you think UUNet and PSI\ncharge each other to exchange traffic with one another? Who benefits\nwhen UUNet and PSI cross-connect? Is UUNet the beneficiary of PSI's\ntraffic, or vice versa? Internet access only costs money at the *edge*\n-- and with a mesh-net, there is no edge anymore. It's penetration at\nthe center, just like the Devo song.\"\n\n\"I'm Adrian,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I'm Kurt,\" the crusty-punk said. \"Buy me a beer, Adrian?\"\n\n\"It'd be my pleasure,\" Alan said.\n\n#\n\nKurt lived in the back of a papered-over storefront on Oxford. The front\ntwo-thirds were a maze of peeling, stickered-over stamped-metal shelving\nunits piled high with junk tech: ancient shrink-wrapped software,\nstacked up low-capacity hard drives, cables and tapes and removable\nmedia. Alan tried to imagine making sense of it all, flowing it into The\nInventory, and felt something like vertigo.\n\nIn a small hollow carved out of the back, Kurt had arranged a cluttered\ndesk, a scuffed twin bed and a rack of milk crates filled with t-shirts\nand underwear.\n\nAlan picked his way delicately through the store and found himself a\nseat on an upturned milk crate. Kurt sat on the bed and grinned\nexpectantly.\n\n\"So?\" he said.\n\n\"So what?\" Alan said.\n\n\"So what is *this*! Isn't it great?\"\n\n\"Well, you sure have a lot of *stuff,* I'll give you that,\" Alan said.\n\n\"It's all dumpstered,\" Kurt said casually.\n\n\"Oh, you dive?\" Alan said. \"I used to dive.\" It was mostly true. Alan\nhad always been a picker, always on the lookout for bargoons, even if\nthey were sticking out of someone's trash bin. Sometimes *especially* if\nthey were sticking out of someone's trash bin -- seeing what normal\npeople threw away gave him a rare glimpse into their lives.\n\nKurt walked over to the nearest shelving unit and grabbed a PC\nmini-tower with the lid off. \"But did you ever do this?\" He stuck the\nmachine under Alan's nose and swung the gooseneck desk lamp over it. It\nwas a white-box PC, generic commodity hardware, with a couple of network\ncards.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's a junk access point! I made it out of trash! The only thing I\nbought were the network cards -- two wireless, one Ethernet. It's\nrunning a FreeBSD distribution off a CD, so the OS can never get\ncorrupted. It's got lots of sweet stuff in the distro, and all you need\nto do is plug it in, point the antennae in opposite directions, and\nyou're up. It does its own power management, it automagically peers with\nother access points if it can find 'em, and it does its own dynamic\nchannel selection to avoid stepping on other access points.\"\n\nAlan turned his head this way and that, making admiring noises. \"You\nmade this, huh?\"\n\n\"For about eighty bucks. It's my fifteenth box. Eventually, I wanna have\na couple hundred of these.\"\n\n\"Ambitious,\" Alan said, handing the box back. \"How do you pay for the\nparts you have to buy? Do you have a grant?\"\n\n\"A grant? Shit, no! I've got a bunch of street kids who come in and take\ndigital pix of the stuff I have no use for, research them online, and\npost them to eBay. I split the take with them. Brings in a couple grand\na week, and I'm keeping about fifty street kids fed besides. I go diving\nthree times a week out in Concord and Oakville and Richmond Hill,\nanywhere I can find an industrial park. If I had room, I'd recruit fifty\nmore kids -- I'm bringing it in faster than they can sell it.\"\n\n\"Why don't you just do less diving?\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me? It's all I can do not to go out every night! You\nwouldn't believe the stuff I find -- all I can think about is all the\nstuff I'm missing out on. Some days I wish that my kids were less\nhonest; if they ripped off some stuff, I'd have room for a lot more.\"\n\nAlan laughed. Worry for Edward and Frederick and George nagged at him,\nimpotent anxiety, but this was just so fascinating. Fascinating and\ndistracting, and, if not normal, at least not nearly so strange as he\ncould be. He imagined the city gridded up with junk equipment, radiating\nInternet access from the lakeshore to the outer suburbs. The grandiosity\ntook his breath away.\n\n\"Look,\" Kurt said, spreading out a map of Kensington Market on the\nunmade bed. \"I've got access points here, here, here, and here. Another\neight or ten and I'll have the whole Market covered. Then I'm going to\nhead north, cover the U of T campus, and push east towards Yonge\nStreet. Bay Street and University Avenue are going to be tough -- how\ncan I convince bankers to let me plug this by their windows?\"\n\n\"Kurt,\" Alan said, \"I suspect that the journey to University Avenue is\ngoing to be a lot slower than you expect it to be.\"\n\nKurt jutted his jaw out. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"There's a lot of real estate between here and there. A lot of trees and\nhigh-rises, office towers and empty lots. You're going to have to knock\non doors every couple hundred meters -- at best -- and convince them to\nlet you install one of these boxes, made from garbage, and plug it in,\nto participate in what?\"\n\n\"Democratic communication!\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Ah, well, my guess is that most of the people who you'll need to\nconvince won't really care much about that. Won't be able to make that\nabstract notion concrete.\"\n\nKurt mumbled into his chest. Alan could see that he was fuming.\n\n\"Just because you don't have the vision to appreciate this --\"\n\nAlan held up his hand. \"Stop right there. I never said anything of the\nsort. I think that this is big and exciting and looks like a lot of\nfun. I think that ringing doorbells and talking people into letting me\nnail an access point to their walls sounds like a *lot* of fun. Really,\nI'm not kidding.\n\n\"But this is a journey, not a destination. The value you'll get out of\nthis will be more in the doing than the having done. The having done's\ngoing to take decades, I'd guess. But the doing's going to be\nsomething.\" Alan's smile was so broad it ached. The idea had seized\nhim. He was drunk on it.\n\nThe buzzer sounded and Kurt got up to answer it. Alan craned his neck to\nsee a pair of bearded neohippies in rasta hats.\n\n\"Are you Kurt?\" one asked.\n\n\"Yeah, dude, I'm Kurt.\"\n\n\"Marcel told us that we could make some money here? We're trying to\nraise bus fare to Burning Man? We could really use the work?\"\n\n\"Not today, but maybe tomorrow,\" Kurt said. \"Come by around lunchtime.\"\n\n\"You sure you can't use us today?\"\n\n\"Not today,\" Kurt said. \"I'm busy today.\"\n\n\"All right,\" the other said, and they slouched away.\n\n\"Word of mouth,\" Kurt said, with a jingling shrug. \"Kids just turn up,\nlooking for work with the trash.\"\n\n\"You think they'll come back tomorrow?\" Alan was pretty good at\nevaluating kids and they hadn't looked very reliable.\n\n\"Those two? Fifty-fifty chance. Tell you what, though: there's always\nenough kids and enough junk to go around.\"\n\n\"But you need to make arrangements to get your access points mounted and\npowered. You've got to sort it out with people who own stores and\nhouses.\"\n\n\"You want to knock on doors?\" Kurt said.\n\n\"I think I would,\" Alan said. \"I suspect it's a possibility. We can\nstart with the shopkeepers, though.\"\n\n\"I haven't had much luck with merchants,\" Kurt said, shrugging his\nshoulders. His chains jingled and a whiff of armpit wafted across the\nclaustrophobic hollow. \"Capitalist pigs.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine why,\" Alan said.\n\n#\n\n\"Wales Avenue, huh?\" Kurt said.\n\nThey were walking down Oxford Street, and Alan was seeing it with fresh\neyes, casting his gaze upward, looking at the lines of sight from one\nbuilding to another, mentally painting in radio-frequency shadows cast\nby the transformers on the light poles.\n\n\"Just moved in on July first,\" Alan said. \"Still getting settled in.\"\n\n\"Which house?\"\n\n\"The blue one, with the big porch, on the corner.\"\n\n\"Sure, I know it. I scored some great plumbing fixtures out of the\ndumpster there last winter.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Alan said.\n\nThey turned at Spadina and picked their way around the tourist crowds\nshopping the Chinese importers' sidewalk displays of bamboo parasols and\nHello Kitty slippers, past the fogged-up windows of the dim-sum\nrestaurants and the smell of fresh pork buns. Alan bought a condensed\nmilk and kiwi snow-cone from a sidewalk vendor and offered to treat\nKurt, but he declined.\n\n\"You never know about those places,\" Kurt said. \"How clean is their ice,\nanyway? Where do they wash their utensils?\"\n\n\"You dig around in dumpsters for a living,\" Alan said. \"Aren't you\nimmune to germs?\"\n\nKurt turned at Baldwin, and Alan followed. \"I don't eat garbage, I pick\nit,\" he said. He sounded angry.\n\n\"Hey, sorry,\" Alan said. \"Sorry. I didn't mean to imply --\"\n\n\"I know you didn't,\" Kurt said, stopping in front of a dry-goods store\nand spooning candied ginger into a baggie. He handed it to the\nage-hunched matron of the shop, who dropped it on her scale and dusted\nher hands on her black dress. Kurt handed her a two-dollar coin and took\nthe bag back. \"I'm just touchy, okay? My last girlfriend split because\nshe couldn't get past it. No matter how much I showered, I was never\nclean enough for her.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Alan said again.\n\n\"I heard something weird about that blue house on the corner,\" Kurt\nsaid. \"One of my kids told me this morning, he saw something last night\nwhen he was in the park.\"\n\nAlan pulled up short, nearly colliding with a trio of cute university\ngirls in wife-beaters pushing bundle-buggies full of newspaper-wrapped\nfish and bags of soft, steaming bagels. They stepped around him, lugging\ntheir groceries over the curb and back onto the sidewalk, not breaking\nfrom their discussion.\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\nKurt gave him a sideways look. \"It's weird, okay? The kid who saw it is\nnever all that reliable, and he likes to embellish.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Alan said. The crowd was pushing around them now, trying to get\npast. The dry-goods lady sucked her teeth in annoyance.\n\n\"So this kid, he was smoking a joint in the park last night, really\nlate, after the clubs shut down. He was alone, and he saw what he\nthought was a dog dragging a garbage bag down the steps of your house.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"So he went over to take a look, and he saw that it was too big to be a\ngarbage bag, and the dog, it looked sick, it moved wrong. He took\nanother step closer and he must have triggered a motion sensor because\nthe porch light switched on. He says...\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He's not very reliable. He says it wasn't a dog, he said it was like a\ndried-out mummy or something, and it had its teeth sunk into the neck of\nthis big, fat, naked guy, and it was dragging the fat guy out into the\nstreet. When the light came on, though, it gave the fat guy's neck a\nhard shake, then let go and turned on this kid, walking toward him on\nstumpy little feet. He says it made a kind of growling noise and lifted\nup its hand like it was going to slap the kid, and the kid screamed and\nran off. When he got to Dundas, he turned around and saw the fat guy get\ndragged into an alley between two of the stores on Augusta.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Alan said.\n\n\"It's stupid, I know,\" Kurt said.\n\nNatalie and Link rounded the corner, carrying slices of pizza from\nPizzabilities, mounded high with eggplant and cauliflower and other\ntoppings that were never intended for use in connection with pizza. They\nstartled on seeing Alan and Kurt, then started to walk away.\n\n\"Wait,\" Alan called. \"Natalie, Link, wait.\" He smiled apologetically at\nKurt. \"My neighbors,\" he said.\n\nNatalie and Link had stopped and turned around. Alan and Kurt walked to\nthem.\n\n\"Natalie, Link, this is Kurt,\" he said. They shook hands all around.\n\n\"I wanted to apologize,\" Alan said. \"I didn't mean to put you between\nKrishna and me. It was very unfair.\"\n\nNatalie smiled warily. Link lit a cigarette with a great show of\nindifference. \"It's all right,\" Natalie said.\n\n\"No, it's not,\" Alan said. \"I was distraught, but that's no\nexcuse. We're going to be neighbors for a long time, and there's no\nsense in our not getting along.\"\n\n\"Really, it's okay,\" Natalie said.\n\n\"Yeah, fine,\" Link said.\n\n\"Three of my brothers have gone missing,\" Alan said. \"That's why I was\nso upset. One disappeared a couple of weeks ago, another last night, and\none this morning. Krishna...\" He thought for a moment. \"He taunted me\nabout it. I really wanted to find out what he saw.\"\n\nKurt shook his head. \"Your brother went missing last night?\"\n\n\"From my house.\"\n\n\"So what the kid saw...\"\n\nAlan turned to Natalie. \"A friend of Kurt's was in the park last\nnight. He says he saw my brother being carried off.\"\n\nKurt shook his head. \"Your brother?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'carried off'?\" Natalie said. She folded her slice in\nhalf to keep the toppings from spilling.\n\n\"Someone is stalking my brothers,\" Alan said. \"Someone very strong and\nvery cunning. Three are gone that I know about. There are others, but I\ncould be next.\"\n\n\"Stalking?\" Natalie said.\n\n\"My family is a little strange,\" Alan said. \"I grew up in the north\ncountry, and things are different there. You've heard of blood feuds?\"\n\nNatalie and Link exchanged a significant look.\n\n\"I know it sounds ridiculous. You don't need to be involved. I just\nwanted to let you know why I acted so strangely last night.\"\n\n\"We have to get back,\" Natalie said. \"Nice to meet you, Kurt. I hope you\nfind your brother, Andy.\"\n\n\"Brothers,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Brothers,\" Natalie said, and walked away briskly.\n\n#\n\nAlan was the oldest of the brothers, and that meant that he was the one\nwho blazed all the new trails in the family.\n\nHe met a girl in the seventh grade. Her name was Marci, and she had just\ntransferred in from Scotland. Her father was a mining engineer, and\nshe'd led a gypsy life that put her in stark contrast to the\nthird-generation homebodies that made up most of the rest of their\nclass.\n\nShe had red hair and blue eyes and a way of holding her face in repose\nthat made her look cunning at all times. No one understood her accent,\nbut there was a wiry ferocity in her movement that warned off any kid\nwho thought about teasing her about it.\n\nAlan liked to play in a marshy corner of the woods that bordered the\nplayground after school, crawling around in the weeds, catching toads\nand letting them go again, spying on the crickets and the secret lives\nof the larvae that grubbed in the milkweed. He was hunkered down on his\nhaunches one afternoon when Marci came crunching through the tall\ngrass. He ducked down lower, then peered out from his hiding spot as she\ncrouched down and he heard the unmistakable patter of urine as she peed\nin the rushes.\n\nHis jaw dropped. He'd never seen a girl pee before, had no idea what the\nsquatting business was all about. The wet ground sucked at his sneaker\nand he tipped back on his ass with a yelp. Marci straightened abruptly\nand crashed over to him, kicking him hard in the ribs when she reached\nhim, leaving a muddy toeprint on his fall windbreaker.\n\nShe wound up for another kick and he hollered something wordless and\nscurried back, smearing marsh mud across his jeans and jacket.\n\n\"You pervert!\" she said, pronouncing it Yuh peervurrt!\n\n\"I am not!\" he said, still scooting back.\n\n\"Watching from the bushes!\" she said.\n\n\"I wasn't -- I was already here, and you -- I mean, what were *you*\ndoing? I was just minding my own business and you came by, I just didn't\nwant to be bothered, this is *my* place!\"\n\n\"You don't own it,\" she said, but she sounded slightly chastened. \"Don't\ntell anyone I had a piss here, all right?\"\n\n\"I won't,\" he said.\n\nShe sat down beside him, unmindful of the mud on her denim\nskirt. \"Promise,\" she said. \"It's so embarrassing.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" he said.\n\n\"Swear,\" she said, and poked him in the ribs with a bony finger.\n\nHe clutched his hands to his ribs. \"Look,\" he said, \"I swear. I'm good\nat secrets.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed slightly. \"Oh, aye? And I suppose you've lots of\nsecrets, then?\"\n\nHe said nothing, and worked at keeping the smile off the corners of his\nmouth.\n\nShe poked him in the ribs, then got him in the stomach as he moved to\nprotect his chest. \"Secrets, huh?\"\n\nHe shook his head and clamped his lips shut. She jabbed a flurry of\npokes and prods at him while he scooted back on his butt, then dug her\nclawed hands into his tummy and tickled him viciously. He giggled, then\nlaughed, then started to hiccup uncontrollably. He shoved her away\nroughly and got up on his knees, gagging.\n\n\"Oh, I like you,\" she said, \"just look at that. A wee tickle and you're\nready to toss your lunch.\" She tenderly stroked his hair until the\nhiccups subsided, then clawed at his belly again, sending him rolling\nthrough the mud.\n\nOnce he'd struggled to his feet, he looked at her, panting. \"Why are you\ndoing this?\"\n\n\"You're not serious! It's the most fun I've had since we moved to this\nterrible place.\"\n\n\"You're a sadist!\" He'd learned the word from a book he'd bought from\nthe ten-cent pile out front of the used bookstore. It had a clipped-out\nrecipe for liver cutlets between the pages and lots of squishy grown-up\nsex things that seemed improbable if not laughable. He'd looked \"sadist\"\nup in the class dictionary.\n\n\"Aye,\" she said. \"I'm that.\" She made claws of her hands and advanced on\nhim slowly. He giggled uncontrollably as he backed away from\nher. \"C'mere, you, you've more torture comin' to ye before I'm satisfied\nthat you can keep a secret.\"\n\nHe held his arms before him like a movie zombie and walked toward\nher. \"Yes, mathter,\" he said in a monotone. Just as he was about to\nreach her, he dodged to one side, then took off.\n\nShe chased him, laughing, halfway back to the mountain, then cried\noff. He stopped a hundred yards up the road from her, she doubled over\nwith her hands planted on her thighs, face red, chest heaving. \"You go\non, then,\" she called. \"But it's more torture for you at school\ntomorrow, and don't you forget it!\"\n\n\"Only if you catch me!\" he called back.\n\n\"Oh, I'll catch you, have no fear.\"\n\n#\n\nShe caught him at lunch. He was sitting in a corner of the schoolyard,\neating from a paper sack of mushrooms and dried rabbit and keeping an\neye on Edward-Frederick-George as he played tag with the other\nkindergartners. She snuck up behind him and dropped a handful of gravel\ndown the gap of his pants and into his underpants. He sprang to his\nfeet, sending gravel rattling out the cuffs of his jeans.\n\n\"Hey!\" he said, and she popped something into his mouth. It was wet and\nwarm from her hand and it squirmed. He spat it out and it landed on the\nschoolyard with a soft splat.\n\nIt was an earthworm, thick with loamy soil.\n\n\"You!\" he said, casting about for a curse of sufficient\nvehemence. \"You!\"\n\nShe hopped from foot to foot in front of him, clearly delighted with\nthis reaction. He reached out for her and she danced back. He took off\nafter her and they were chasing around the yard, around hopscotches and\ntag games and sand castles and out to the marshy woods. She skidded\nthrough the puddles and he leapt over them. She ducked under a branch\nand he caught her by the hood of her windbreaker.\n\nWithout hesitating, she flung her arms in the air and slithered out of\nthe windbreaker, down to a yellow T-shirt that rode up her back,\nexposing her pale freckles and the knobs of her spine, the fingers of\nher ribs. She took off again and he balled the windbreaker up in his\nfist and took off after her.\n\nShe stepped behind a bushy pine, and when he rounded the corner she was\nwaiting for him, her hands clawed, digging at his tummy, leaving him\ngiggling. He pitched back into the pine needles and she followed,\nstraddling his waist and tickling him until he coughed and choked and\ngasped for air.\n\n\"Tell me!\" she said. \"Tell me your secrets!\"\n\n\"Stop!\" Alan said. \"Please! I'm going to piss myself!\"\n\n\"What's that to me?\" she said, tickling more vigorously.\n\nHe tried to buck her off, but she was too fast. He caught one wrist, but\nshe pinned his other arm with her knee. He heaved and she collapsed on\ntop of him.\n\nHer face was inches from his, her breath moist on his face. They both\npanted, and he smelled her hair, which was over his face and neck. She\nleaned forward and closed her eyes expectantly.\n\nHe tentatively brushed his lips across hers, and she moved closer, and\nthey kissed. It was wet and a little gross, but not altogether\nunpleasant.\n\nShe leaned back and opened her eyes, then grinned at him. \"That's enough\ntorture for one day,\" she said. \"You're free to go.\"\n\n#\n\nShe \"tortured\" him at morning and afternoon recess for the next two\nweeks, and when he left school on Friday afternoon after the last bell,\nshe was waiting for him in the schoolyard.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said, socking him in the arm.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said.\n\n\"Why don't you invite me over for supper this weekend?\" she said.\n\n\"Supper?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm your girlfriend, yeah? So you should have me around to your\nplace to meet your parents. Next weekend you can come around my place\nand meet my dad.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" he said.\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It's a secret,\" he said.\n\n\"Oooh, a secret,\" she said. \"What kind of secret?\"\n\n\"A family secret. We don't have people over for dinner. That's the way\nit is.\"\n\n\"A secret! They're all child molesters?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Horribly deformed?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"What, then? Give us a hint?\"\n\n\"It's a secret.\"\n\nShe grabbed his ear and twisted it. Gently at first, then harder. \"A\nsecret?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" he gasped. \"It's a secret, and I can't tell you. You're hurting\nme.\"\n\n\"I should hope so,\" she said. \"And it will go very hard for you indeed\nif you don't tell me what I want to know.\"\n\nHe grabbed her wrist and dug his strong fingers into the thin tendons on\ntheir insides, twisting his fingertips for maximal effect. Abruptly, she\nreleased his ear and clenched her wrist hard, sticking it between her\nthighs.\n\n\"Owwww! That bloody hurt, you bastard. What did you do that for?\"\n\n\"My secrets,\" Alan said, \"are secret.\"\n\nShe held her wrist up and examined it. \"Heaven help you if you've left a\nbruise, Alvin,\" she said. \"I'll kill you.\" She turned her wrist from\nside to side. \"All right,\" she said. \"All right. Kiss it better, and you\ncan come to my place for supper on Saturday at six p.m..\" She shoved her\narm into his face and he kissed the soft skin on the inside of her\nwrist, putting a little tongue in it.\n\nShe giggled and punched him in the arm. \"Saturday, then!\" she called as\nshe ran off.\n\n#\n\nEdward-Felix-Gerald were too young to give him shit about his schoolyard\nromance, and Brian was too sensitive, but Dave had taken to lurking\nabout the schoolyard, spying on the children, and he'd seen Marci break\noff from a clench with Alan, take his hand, and plant it firmly on her\ntiny breast, an act that had shocked Danny to the core.\n\n\"Hi, pervert,\" David said, as he stepped into the cool of the\ncave. \"Pervert\" was Davey's new nickname for him, and he had a finely\nhoned way of delivering it so that it dripped with contempt. \"Did you\nhave sex with your *girlfriend* today, *pervert*?\"\n\nAllan turned away from him and helped E-F-G take off his shoes and roll\nup the cuffs of his pants so that he could go down to the lake in the\nmiddle of their father and wade in the shallows, listening to Father's\nwinds soughing through the great cavern.\n\n\"Did you touch her boobies? Did she suck your pee-pee? Did you put your\nfinger in her?\" The litany would continue until Davey went to bed, and\neven then he wasn't safe. One night, Allen had woken up to see Darren\nstanding over him, hands planted on his hips, face twisted into an\nelaborate sneer. \"Did you put your penis inside of her?\" he'd hissed,\nthen gone back to bed.\n\nAlby went out again, climbing the rockface faster than Doug could keep\nup with him, so that by the time he'd found his perch high over the\nwoodlands, where he could see the pines dance in the wind and the\nant-sized cars zooming along the highways, Doug was far behind, likely\nsat atop their mother, sucking his thumb and sulking and thinking up new\nperversions to accuse Alan of.\n\n#\n\nSaturday night arrived faster than Alan could have imagined. He spent\nSaturday morning in the woods, picking mushrooms and checking his\nsnares, then headed down to town on Saturday afternoon to get a haircut\nand to haunt the library.\n\nConverting his father's gold to cash was easier than getting a library\ncard without an address. There was an old assayer whom the golems had\ndescribed to him before his first trip to town. The man was cheap but he\nknew enough about the strangeness on the mountain not to cheat him too\nbadly. The stern librarian who glared at him while he walked the\nshelves, sometimes looking at the titles, sometimes the authors, and\nsometimes the Dewey Decimal numbers had no such fear.\n\nThe Deweys were fascinating. They traced the fashions in human knowledge\nand wisdom. It was easy enough to understand why the arbiters of the\nsystem subdivided Motorized Land Vehicles (629.2) into several\ncategories, but here in the 629.22s, where the books on automobiles\nwere, you could see the planners' deficiencies. Automobiles divided into\ndozens of major subcategories (taxis and limousines, buses, light\ntrucks, cans, lorries, tractor trailers, campers, motorcycles, racing\ncars, and so on), then ramified into a combinatorial explosion of\nsub-sub-sub categories. There were Dewey numbers on some of the\nautomotive book spines that had twenty digits or more after the decimal,\nan entire Dewey Decimal system hidden between 629.2 and 629.3.\n\nTo the librarian, this shelf-reading looked like your garden-variety\nscrewing around, but what really made her nervous were Alan's excursions\nthrough the card catalogue, which required constant tending to replace\nthe cards that errant patrons made unauthorized reorderings of.\n\nThe subject headings in the third bank of card drawers were the most\ninteresting of all. They, too, branched and forked and rejoined\nthemselves like the meanderings of an ant colony on the march. He'd go\nin sequence for a while, then start following cross-references when he\nfound an interesting branch, keeping notes on scraps of paper on top of\nthe file drawer. He had spent quite some time in the mythology\ncategories, looking up golems and goblins, looking up changelings and\nmonsters, looking up seers and demigods, but none of the books that he'd\ntaken down off the shelves had contained anything that helped him\nunderstand his family better.\n\nHis family was uncatalogued and unclassified in human knowledge.\n\n#\n\nHe rang the bell on Marci's smart little brick house at bang-on six,\ncarrying some daisies he'd bought from the grocery store, following the\netiquette laid down in several rather yucky romance novels he'd perused\nthat afternoon.\n\nShe answered in jeans and a T-shirt, and punched him in the arm before\nhe could give her the flowers. \"Don't you look smart?\" she said. \"Well,\nyou're not fooling anyone, you know.\" She gave him a peck on the cheek\nand snatched away the daisies. \"Come along, then, we're eating soon.\"\n\nMarci sat him down in the living room, which was furnished with neutral\nsofas and a neutral carpet and a neutral coffee table. The bookcases\nwere bare. \"It's horrible,\" she said, making a face. She was twittering\na little, dancing from foot to foot. Alan was glad to know he wasn't the\nonly one who was uncomfortable. \"Isn't it? The company put us up\nhere. We had a grand flat in Scotland.\"\n\n\"It's nice,\" Alan said, \"but you look like you could use some books.\"\n\nShe crossed her eyes. \"Books? Sure -- I've got *ten boxes* of them in\nthe basement. You can come by and help me unpack them.\"\n\n\"Ten *boxes?*\" Alan said. \"You're making that up.\" *Ten boxes of books!*\nThings like books didn't last long under the mountain, in the damp and\nwith the ever-inquisitive, ever-destructive Davey exploring every inch\nof floor and cave and corridor in search of opportunities for pillage.\n\n\"I ain't neither,\" she said. \"At least ten. It was a grand flat and they\nwere all in alphabetical order, too.\"\n\n\"Can we go see?\" Alan asked, getting up from the sofa.\n\n\"See boxes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Alan said. \"And look inside. We could unbox them after dinner,\nokay?\"\n\n\"That's more of an afternoon project,\" said a voice from the top of the\nstairs.\n\n\"That's my Da,\" she said. \"Come down and introduce yourself to Alan,\nDa,\" she said. \"You're not the voice of God, so you can bloody well turn\nup and show your face.\"\n\n\"No more sass, gel, or it will go very hard for you,\" said the\nvoice. The accent was like Marci's squared, thick as oatmeal,\nliqueur-thick. Nearly incomprehensible, but the voice was kind and smart\nand patient, too.\n\n\"You'll have a hard time giving me any licks from the top of the stairs,\nDa, and Alan looks like he's going to die if you don't at least come\ndown and say hello.\"\n\nAlan blushed furiously. \"You can come down whenever you like, sir,\" he\nsaid. \"That's all right.\"\n\n\"That's mighty generous of you, young sir,\" said the voice. \"Aye. But\nbefore I come down, tell me, are your intentions toward my daughter\nhonorable?\"\n\nHis cheeks grew even hotter, and his ears felt like they were melting\nwith embarrassment. \"Yes, sir,\" he said in a small voice.\n\n\"He's a dreadful pervert, Da,\" Marci said. \"You should see the things he\ntries, you'd kill him, you would.\" She grinned foxish and punched him in\nthe shoulder. He sank into the cushions, face suddenly drained of blood.\n\n\"*What*?\" roared the voice, and there was a clatter of slippers on the\nneutral carpet of the stairs. Alan didn't want to look but found that he\ncouldn't help himself, his head inexorably turned toward the sound,\nuntil a pair of thick legs hove into sight, whereupon Marci leapt into\nhis lap and threw her arms around his neck.\n\n\"Ge'orff me, pervert!\" she said, as she began to cover his face in\ndarting, pecking kisses.\n\nHe went rigid and tried to sink all the way into the sofa.\n\n\"All right, all right, that's enough of that,\" her father said. Marci\nstood and dusted herself off. Alan stared at his knees.\n\n\"She's horrible, isn't she?\" said the voice, and a great, thick hand\nappeared in his field of vision. He shook it tentatively, noting the\nheavy class ring and the thin, plain wedding band. He looked up slowly.\n\nMarci's father was short but powerfully built, like the wrestlers on the\nother kids' lunchboxes at school. He had a shock of curly black hair\nthat was flecked with dandruff, and a thick bristling mustache that made\nhim look very fierce, though his eyes were gentle and bookish behind\nthick glasses. He was wearing wool trousers and a cable-knit sweater\nthat was unraveling at the elbows.\n\n\"Pleased to meet you, Albert,\" he said. They shook hands gravely. \"I've\nbeen after her to unpack those books since we moved here. You could come\nby tomorrow afternoon and help, if you'd like -- I think it's the only\nway I'll get herself to stir her lazy bottom to do some chores around\nhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, *Da*!\" Marci said. \"Who cooks around here? Who does the laundry?\"\n\n\"The take-away pizza man does the majority of the cooking, daughter. And\nas for laundry, the last time I checked, there were two weeks' worth of\nlaundry to do.\"\n\n\"Da,\" she said in a sweet voice, \"I love you Da,\" she said, wrapping her\narms around his trim waist.\n\n\"You see what I have to put up with?\" her father said, snatching her up\nand dangling her by her ankles.\n\nShe flailed her arms about and made outraged choking noises while he\nswung her back and forth like a pendulum, releasing her at the top of\none arc so that she flopped onto the sofa in a tangle of thin limbs.\n\n\"It's a madhouse around here,\" her father continued as Marci righted\nherself, knocking Alan in the temple with a tennis shoe, \"but what can\nyou do? Once she's a little bigger, I can put her to work in the mines,\nand then I'll have a little peace around here.\" He sat down on an\noverstuffed armchair with a fussy antimacassar.\n\n\"He's got a huge life-insurance policy,\" Marci said\nconspiratorially. \"I'm just waiting for him to kick the bucket and then\nI'm going to retire.\"\n\n\"Oh, aye,\" her father said. \"Retire. Your life is an awful one, it\nis. Junior high is a terrible hardship, I know.\"\n\nAlan found himself grinning.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Marci said, punching him in the shoulder.\n\n\"You two are,\" he said, grabbing her arm and then digging his fingers\ninto her tummy, doubling her over with tickles.\n\n#\n\nThere were *twelve* boxes of books. The damp in the basement had\nsoftened the cartons to cottage-cheese mush, and the back covers of the\nbottom layer of paperbacks were soft as felt. To Alan, these seemed\nunremarkable -- all paper under the mountain looked like this after a\nweek or two, even if Doug didn't get to it -- but Marci was heartbroken.\n\n\"My books, my lovely books, they're roont!\" she said, as they piled them\non the living room carpet.\n\n\"They're fine,\" Alan said. \"They'll dry out a little wobbly, but they'll\nbe fine. We'll just spread the damp ones out on the rug and shelve the\nrest.\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, book after book -- old books, hardcover books,\nboard-back kids' books, new paperbacks, dozens of green- and\norange-spined Penguin paperbacks. He fondled them, smelled them. Some\nsmelled of fish and chips, and some smelled of road dust, and some\nsmelled of Marci, and they had dog ears where she'd stopped and cracks\nin their spines where she'd bent them around. They fell open to pages\nthat had her favorite passages. He felt wobbly and drunk as he touched\neach one in turn.\n\n\"Have you read all of these?\" Alan asked as he shifted the John\nMortimers down one shelf to make room for the Ed McBains.\n\n\"Naw,\" she said, punching him in the shoulder. \"What's the point of a\nbunch of books you've already read?\"\n\n#\n\nShe caught him in the schoolyard on Monday and dragged him by one ear\nout to the marshy part. She pinned him down and straddled his chest and\ntickled him with one hand so that he cried out and used the other hand\nto drum a finger across his lips, so that his cries came out \"bibble.\"\n\nOnce he'd bucked her off, they kissed for a little while, then she\ngrabbed hold of one of his nipples and twisted.\n\n\"All right,\" she said. \"Enough torture. When do I get to meet your\nfamily?\"\n\n\"You can't,\" he said, writhing on the pine needles, which worked their\nway up the back of his shirt and pricked him across his lower back,\nfeeling like the bristles of a hairbrush.\n\n\"Oh, I can, and I will,\" she said. She twisted harder.\n\nHe slapped her hand away. \"My family is really weird,\" he said. \"My\nparents don't really ever go out. They're not like other people. They\ndon't talk.\" All of it true.\n\n\"They're mute?\"\n\n\"No, but they don't talk.\"\n\n\"They don't talk much, or they don't talk at all?\" She pronounced it\na-tall.\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"How did you and your brothers learn to talk, then?\"\n\n\"Neighbors.\" Still true. The golems lived in the neighboring caves. \"And\nmy father, a little.\" True.\n\n\"So you have neighbors who visit you?\" she asked, a triumphant gleam in\nher eye.\n\n*Damn*. \"No, we visit them.\" Lying now. Sweat on the shag of hair over\n his ears, which felt like they had coals pressed to them.\n\n\"When you were a baby?\"\n\n\"No, my grandparents took care of me when I was a baby.\" Deeper. \"But\nthey died.\" Bottoming out now.\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" she said, and he saw tears glisten in her\neyes. \"You're too embarrassed to introduce me to your family.\"\n\n\"That's not it.\" He thought fast. \"My brother. David. He's not well. He\nhas a brain tumor. We think he'll probably die. That's why he doesn't\ncome to school. And it makes him act funny. He hits people, says\nterrible things.\" Mixing truth with lies was a *lot* easier. \"He shouts\nand hurts people and he's the reason I can't ever have friends over. Not\nuntil he dies.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \"If that's a lie,\" she said, \"it's a terrible one. My\nMa died of cancer, and it's not something anyone should make fun of. So,\nit better not be a lie.\"\n\n\"It's not a lie,\" he said, mustering a tear. \"My brother David, we don't\nknow how long he'll live, but it won't be long. He acts like a monster,\nso it's hard to love him, but we all try.\"\n\nShe rocked back onto her haunches. \"It's true, then?\" she asked softly.\n\nHe nodded miserably.\n\n\"Let's say no more about it, then,\" she said. She took his hand and\ntraced hieroglyphs on his palm with the ragged edges of her chewed-up\nfingernails.\n\nThe recess bell rang and they headed back to school. They were about to\nleave the marshland when something hard hit Alan in the back of the\nhead. He spun around and saw a small, sharp rock skitter into the grass,\nsaw Davey's face contorted with rage, lips pulled all the way back off\nhis teeth, half-hidden in the boughs of a tree, winding up to throw\nanother rock.\n\nHe flinched away and the rock hit the paving hard enough to\nbounce. Marci whirled around, but David was gone, high up in the leaves,\ninvisible, malicious, biding.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" Alan lied, and groaned.\n\n#\n\nKurt and Alan examined every gap between every storefront on Augusta, no\nmatter how narrow. Kurt kept silent as Alan fished his arm up to the\nshoulder along miniature alleys that were just wide enough to\naccommodate the rain gutters depending from the roof.\n\nThey found the alley that Frederick had been dragged down near the end\nof the block, between a mattress store and an egg wholesaler. It was\nnarrow enough that they had to traverse it sideways, but there, at the\nentrance, were two smears of skin and blood, just above the ground,\nstretching off into the sulfurous, rotty-egg depths of the alleyway.\n\nThey slid along the alley's length, headed for the gloom of the\nback. Something skittered away from Alan's shoe and he bent down, but\ncouldn't see it. He ran his hands along the ground and the walls and\nthey came back with a rime of dried blood and a single strand of long,\noily hair stuck to them. He wiped his palms off on the bricks.\n\n\"I can't see,\" he said.\n\n\"Here,\" Kurt said, handing him a miniature maglight whose handle was\ncorrugated by hundreds of toothmarks. Alan saw that he was intense,\nwatching.\n\nAlan twisted the light on. \"Thanks,\" he said, and Kurt smiled at him,\nseemed a little taller. Alan looked again. There, on the ground, was a\nsharpened black tooth, pierced by a piece of pipe-cleaner wire.\n\nHe pocketed the tooth before Kurt saw it and delved farther, approaching\nthe alley's end, which was carpeted with a humus of moldering cardboard,\nleaves, and road turds blown or washed there. He kicked it aside as best\nhe could, then crouched down to examine the sewer grating beneath. The\ngreenish brass screws that anchored it to the ground had sharp cuts in\ntheir old grooves where they had been recently removed. He rattled the\ngrating, which was about half a meter square, then slipped his multitool\nout of his belt holster. He flipped out the Phillips driver and went to\nwork on the screws, unconsciously putting Kurt's flashlight in his\nmouth, his front teeth finding purchase in the dents that Kurt's own had\nleft there.\n\nHe realized with a brief shudder that Kurt probably used this flashlight\nwhile nipple-deep in dumpsters, had an image of Kurt transferring it\nfrom his gloved hands to his mouth and back again as he dug through bags\nof kitchen and toilet waste, looking for discarded technology. But the\nmetal was cool and clean against his teeth and so he bit down and worked\nthe four screws loose, worked his fingers into the mossy slots in the\ngrate, lifted it out, and set it to one side.\n\nHe shone the light down the hole and found another fingerbone, the tip\nof a thumb, desiccated to the size of a large raisin, and he pocketed\nthat, too. There was a lot of blood here, a little puddle that was still\nwet in the crusted middle. Frederick's blood.\n\nHe stepped over the grating and shone the light back down the hole,\ninviting Kurt to have a look.\n\n\"That's where they went,\" he said as Kurt bent down.\n\n\"That hole?\"\n\n\"That hole,\" he said.\n\n\"Is that blood?\"\n\n\"That's blood. It's not easy to fit someone my brother's size down a\nhole like that.\" He set the grate back, screwed it into place, and\npassed the torch back to Kurt. \"Let's get out of here,\" he said.\n\nOn the street, Alan looked at his blood and moss-grimed palms. Kurt\npushed back his floppy, frizzed-out, bleach-white mohawk and scratched\nvigorously at the downy brown fuzz growing in on the sides of his skull.\n\n\"You think I'm a nut,\" Alan said. \"It's okay, that's natural.\"\n\nKurt smiled sheepishly. \"If it's any consolation, I think you're a\n*harmless* nut, okay? I like you.\"\n\n\"You don't have to believe me, so long as you don't get in my way,\" Alan\nsaid. \"But it's easier if you believe me.\"\n\n\"Easier to do what?\"\n\n\"Oh, to get along,\" Alan said.\n\n#\n\nDavey leapt down from a rock outcropping as Alan made his way home that\nnight, landing on his back. Alan stumbled and dropped his school bag. He\ngrabbed at the choking arm around his neck, then dropped to his knees as\nDavey bounced a fist-sized stone off his head, right over his ear.\n\nHe slammed himself back, pinning Davey between himself and the sharp\nstones on the walkway up to the cave entrance, then mashed backward with\nhis elbows, his head ringing like a gong from the stone's blow. His left\nelbow connected with Davey's solar plexus and the arm around his throat\nwent slack.\n\nHe climbed to his knees and looked Davey in the face. He was blue and\ngasping, but Alan couldn't work up a lot of sympathy for him as he\nreached up to the side of his head and felt the goose egg welling\nthere. His fingertips came back with a few strands of hair blood-glued\nto them.\n\nHe'd been in a few schoolyard scraps and this was always the moment when\na teacher intervened -- one combatant pinned, the other atop him. What\ncould you do after this? Was he going to take the rock from Davey's hand\nand smash him in the face with it, knocking out his teeth, breaking his\nnose, blacking his eyes? Could he get off of Davey without getting back\ninto the fight?\n\nHe pinned Davey's shoulders under his knees and took him by the chin\nwith one hand. \"You can't do this, Danny,\" he said, looking into his\nhazel eyes, which had gone green as they did when he was angry.\n\n\"Do *what*?\"\n\n\"Spy on me. Try to hurt me. Try to hurt my friends. Tease me all the\ntime. You can't do it, okay?\"\n\n\"I'll stab you in your sleep, Andy. I'll break your fingers with a\nbrick. I'll poke your eyes out with a fork.\" He was fizzling like a\nbaking-soda volcano, saliva slicking his cheeks and nostrils and chin,\nhis eyes rolling.\n\nAlan felt helplessness settle on him, weighing down his limbs. How could\nhe let him go? What else could he do? Was he going to have to sit on\nDavey's shoulders until they were both old men?\n\n\"Please, Davey. I'm sorry about what I said. I just can't bring her\nhome, you understand,\" he said.\n\n\"Pervert. She's a slut and you're a pervert. I'll tear her titties off.\"\n\n\"Don't, Danny, please. Stop, okay?\"\n\nDarren bared his teeth and growled, jerking his head forward and\nsnapping at Alan's crotch, heedless of the painful thuds his head made\nwhen it hit the ground after each lunge.\n\nAlan waited to see if he would tire himself out, but when it was clear\nthat he would not tire, Alan waited for his head to thud to the ground\nand then, abruptly, he popped him in the chin, leapt off of him turned\nhim on his belly, and wrenched him to his knees, twisting one arm behind\nhis back and pulling his head back by the hair. He brought Davey to his\nfeet, under his control, before he'd recovered from the punch.\n\n\"I'm telling Dad,\" he said in Davey's ear, and began to frog-march him\nthrough to the cave mouth and down into the lake in the middle of the\nmountain. He didn't even slow down when they reached the smooth shore of\nthe lake, just pushed on, sloshing in up to his chest, Davey's head\nbarely above the water.\n\n\"He won't stop,\" Alan said, to the winds, to the water, to the vaulted\nceiling, to the scurrying retreat of the goblin. \"I think he'll kill me\nif he goes on. He's torturing me. You've seen it. Look at him!\"\n\nDavey was thrashing in the water, his face swollen and bloody, his eyes\nrattling like dried peas in a maraca. Alan's fingers, still buried in\nDavey's shiny blond hair, kept brushing up against the swollen bruises\nthere, getting bigger by the moment. \"I'll *fucking* kill you!\" Davey\nhowled, screaming inchoate into the echo that came back from his call.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Alan said into his ear. \"Shhh. Listen, Davey, please, shhh.\"\n\nDavey's roar did not abate. Alan thought he could hear the whispers and\ngroans of their father in the wind, but he couldn't make it\nout. \"Please, shhh,\" he said, gathering Davey in a hug that pinned his\narms to his sides, putting his lips up against Davey's ear, holding him\nstill.\n\n\"Shhh,\" he said, and Davey stopped twitching against him, stopped his\nterrible roar, and they listened.\n\nAt first the sound was barely audible, a soughing through the tunnels,\nbut gradually the echoes chased each other round the great cavern and\nacross the still, dark surface of the lake, and then a voice, illusive\nas a face in the clouds.\n\n\"My boys,\" the voice said, their father said. \"My sons. David, Alan. You\nmust not fight like this.\"\n\n\"He --!\" Davey began, the echoes of his outburst scattering their\nfather's voice.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Alan said again.\n\n\"Daniel, you must love your brother. He loves you. I love you. Trust\nhim. He won't hurt you. I won't let you come to any harm. I love you,\nson.\"\n\nAlan felt Danny tremble in his arms, and he was trembling, too, from the\nicy cold of the lake and from the voice and the words and the love that\nechoed from every surface.\n\n\"Adam, my son. Keep your brother safe. You need each other. Don't be\nimpatient or angry with him. Give him love.\"\n\n\"I will,\" Alan said, and he relaxed his arms so that he was holding\nDanny in a hug and not a pinion. Danny relaxed back into him. \"I love\nyou, Dad,\" he said, and they trudged out of the water, out into the last\nwarmth of the day's sun, to dry out on the slope of the mountainside,\ngreen grass under their bodies and wispy clouds in the sky that they\nwatched until the sun went out.\n\n#\n\nMarci followed him home a week before Christmas break. He didn't notice\nher at first. She was cunning, and followed his boot prints in the\nsnow. A blizzard had blown up halfway through the school day, and by the\ntime class let out, there was fresh knee-deep powder and he had to lift\neach foot high to hike through it, the shush of his snow pants and the\nhuff of his breath the only sounds in the icy winter evening.\n\nShe followed the deep prints of his boots on the fresh snow, stalking\nhim like he stalked rabbits in the woods. When he happened to turn\naround at the cave mouth, he spotted her in her yellow snow-suit,\nstruggling up the mountainside, barely visible in the twilight.\n\nHe'd never seen an intruder on the mountain. The dirt trail that led up\nto the cave branched off a side road on the edge of town, and it was too\nrocky even for the dirt-bike kids. He stood at the cave-mouth, torn by\nindecision. He wanted to keep walking, head away farther uphill, away\nfrom the family's den, but now she'd seen him, had waved to him. His\ncold-numb face drained of blood and his bladder hammered insistently at\nhim. He hiked down the mountain and met her.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" he said, once he was close enough to see her pale,\nfreckled face.\n\n\"Why do you think?\" she said. \"I followed you home. Where do you live,\nAlan? Why can't I even see where you live?\"\n\nHe felt tears prick at his eyes. \"You just *can't*! I can't bring you\nhome!\"\n\n\"You hate me, don't you?\" she said, hands balling up into mittened\nfists. \"That's it.\"\n\n\"I don't hate you, Marci. I -- I love you,\" he said, surprising himself.\n\nShe punched him hard in the arm. \"Shut up.\" She kissed his cheek with\nher cold, dry lips and the huff of her breath thawed his skin, making it\ntingle.\n\n\"Where do you live, Alan?\"\n\nHe sucked air so cold it burned his lungs. \"Come with me.\" He took her\nmittened hand in his and trudged up to the cave mouth.\n\nThey entered the summer cave, where the family spent its time in the\nwarm months, now mostly empty, save for some straw and a few scattered\nbits of clothing and toys. He led her through the cave, his eyes\nadjusting to the gloom, back to the right-angle bend behind a stalactite\nbaffle, toward the sulfur reek of the hot spring on whose shores the\nfamily spent its winters.\n\n\"It gets dark,\" he said. \"I'll get you a light once we're inside.\"\n\nHer hand squeezed his tighter and she said nothing.\n\nIt grew darker and darker as he pushed into the cave, helping her up the\ngentle incline of the cave floor. He saw well in the dark -- the whole\nfamily did -- but he understood that for her this was a blind voyage.\n\nThey stepped out into the sulfur-spring cavern, the acoustics of their\nbreathing changed by the long, flat hollow. In the dark, he saw\nEdward-Frederick-George playing with his matchbox cars in one corner;\nDavey leaned up against their mother, sucking his thumb. Billy was\nnowhere in sight, probably hiding out in his room -- he would, of\ncourse, have foreseen this visit.\n\nHe put her hand against the cave wall, then said, \"Wait here.\" He let go\nof her and walked quickly to the heap of winter coats and boots in the\ncorner and dug through them for the flashlight he used to do his\nhomework by. It was a hand-crank number, and as he squeezed it to life,\nhe pointed it at Marci, her face wan and scared in its light. He gave\nthe flashlight a few more pumps to get its flywheel spinning, then\npassed it to her.\n\n\"Just keep squeezing it,\" he said. \"It doesn't need batteries.\" He took\nher hand again. It was limp.\n\n\"You can put your things on the pile,\" he said, pointing to the coats\nand boots. He was already shucking his hat and mittens and boots and\nsnow pants and coat. His skin flushed with the warm vapors coming off of\nthe sulfur spring.\n\n\"You *live* here?\" she said. The light from the flashlight was dimming\nand he reached over and gave it a couple of squeezes, then handed it\nback to her.\n\n\"I live here. It's complicated.\"\n\nDavey's eyes were open and he was staring at them with squinted eyes and\na frown.\n\n\"Where are your parents?\" she said.\n\n\"It's complicated,\" he said again, as though that explained\neverything. \"This is my secret. No one else knows it.\"\n\nEdward-Frederick-George tottered over to them with an armload of toy\ncars, which he mutely offered to Marci, smiling a drooly smile. Alan\npatted him on the head and knelt down. \"I don't think Marci wants to\nplay cars, okay?\" Ed nodded solemnly and went back to the edge of the\npool and began running his cars through the nearly scalding water.\n\nMarci reached out a hand ahead of her into the weak light, looked at the\ncrazy shadows it cast on the distant walls. \"How can you live here? It's\na cave, Alan. How can you live in a cave?\"\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Alan said. \"I can't explain it all, and the parts\nthat I can explain, you wouldn't believe. But you've been to my home\nnow, Marci. I've shown you where I live.\"\n\nDavey approached them, a beatific smile on his angelic face.\n\n\"This is my brother, Daniel,\" Alan said. \"The one I told you about.\"\n\n\"You're his slut,\" Davey said. He was still smiling. \"Do you touch his\npeter?\"\n\nAlan flinched, suppressing a desire to smack Davey, but Marci just knelt\ndown and looked him in the eye. \"Nope,\" she said. \"Are you always this\nhorrible to strangers?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Davey said, cheerfully. \"I hate you, and I hate *him*,\" he cocked\nhis head Alanward. \"And you're all *motherfuckers.*\"\n\n\"But we're not wee horrible shits, Danny,\" she said. \"We're not\nfilthy-mouthed brats who can't keep a civil tongue.\"\n\nDavey snapped his head back and then forward, trying to get her in the\nbridge of the nose, a favorite tactic of his, but she was too fast for\nhim and ducked it, so that he stumbled and fell to his knees.\n\n\"Your mother's going to be very cross when she finds out how you've been\nacting. You'll be lucky if you get any Christmas pressies,\" she said as\nhe struggled to his feet.\n\nHe swung a punch at her groin, and she caught his wrist and then hoisted\nhim to his tiptoes by his arm, then lifted him off the floor, bringing\nhis face up level with hers. \"Stop it,\" she said. \"*Now*.\"\n\nHe fell silent and narrowed his eyes as he dangled there, thinking about\nthis. Then he spat in her face. Marci shook her head slowly as the gob\nof spit slid down her eyebrow and over her cheek, then she spat back,\nnailing him square on the tip of his nose. She set him down and wiped\nher face with a glove.\n\nDavey started toward her, and she lifted a hand and he flinched back and\nthen ran behind their mother, hiding in her tangle of wires and\nhoses. Marci gave the flashlight a series of hard cranks that splashed\nlight across the washing machine and then turned to Alan.\n\n\"That's your brother?\"\n\nAlan nodded.\n\n\"Well, I see why you didn't want me to come home with you, then.\"\n\n#\n\nKurt was properly appreciative of Alan's bookcases and trophies, ran his\nfingertips over the wood, willingly accepted some iced mint tea\nsweetened with honey, and used a coaster without having to be asked.\n\n\"A washing machine and a mountain,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Alan said. \"He kept a roof over our heads and she kept our\nclothes clean.\"\n\n\"You've told that joke before, right?\" Kurt's foot was bouncing, which\nmade the chains on his pants and jacket jangle.\n\n\"And now Davey's after us,\" Alan said. \"I don't know why it's now. I\ndon't know why Davey does *anything*. But he always hated me most of\nall.\"\n\n\"So why did he snatch your brothers first?\"\n\n\"I think he wants me to sweat. He wants me scared, all the time. I'm the\neldest. I'm the one who left the mountain. I'm the one who came first,\nand made all the connections with the outside world. They all looked to\nme to explain the world, but I never had any explanations that would\nsuit Davey.\"\n\n\"This is pretty weird,\" he said.\n\nAlan cocked his head at Kurt. He was about thirty, old for a punk, and\nhad a kind of greasy sheen about him, like he didn't remember to wash\noften enough, despite his protestations about his cleanliness. But at\nthirty, he should have seen enough to let him know that the world was\nboth weirder than he suspected and not so weird as certain mystically\ninclined people would like to believe.\n\nArnold didn't like this moment of disclosure, didn't like dropping his\ncarefully cultivated habit of hiding this, but he also couldn't help but\nfeel relieved. A part of his mind nagged him, though, and told him that\ntoo much of this would waken the worry for his brothers from its\nnarcotized slumber.\n\n\"I've told other people, just a few. They didn't believe me. You don't\nhave to. Why don't you think about it for a while?\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I'm going to try to figure out how to find my brothers. I can't go\nunderground like Davey can. I don't think I can, anyway. I never\nhave. But Davey's so... *broken*... so small and twisted. He's not\nsmart, but he's cunning and he's determined. I'm smarter than he is. So\nI'll try to find the smart way. I'll think about it, too.\"\n\n\"Well, I've got to get ready to go diving,\" Kurt said. He stood up with\na jangle. \"Thanks for the iced tea, Adam.\"\n\n\"It was nice to meet you, Kurt,\" Alan said, and shook his hand.\n\n#\n\nAlan woke with something soft over his face. It was pitch dark, and he\ncouldn't breathe. He tried to reach up, but his arms wouldn't move. He\ncouldn't sit up. Something heavy was sitting on his chest. The soft\nthing -- a pillow? -- ground against his face, cruelly pressing down on\nthe cartilage in his nose, filling his mouth as he gasped for air.\n\nHe shuddered hard, and felt something give near his right wrist and then\nhis arm was loose from the elbow down. He kept working the arm, his\nchest afire, and then he'd freed it to the shoulder, and something bit\nhim, hard little teeth like knives, in the fleshy underside of his\nbicep. Flailing dug the teeth in harder, and he knew he was bleeding,\ncould feel it seeping down his arm. Finally, he got his hand onto\nsomething, a desiccated, mummified piece of flesh. Davey. Davey's ribs,\nlike dry stones, cold and thin. He felt up higher, felt for the place\nwhere Davey's arm met his shoulder, and then twisted as hard as he\ncould, until the arm popped free in its socket. He shook his head\nviolently and the pillow slid away.\n\nThe room was still dark, and the hot, moist air rushed into his nostrils\nand mouth as he gasped it in. He heard Davey moving in the dark, and as\nhis eyes adjusted, he saw him unfolding a knife. It was a clasp knife\nwith a broken hasp and it swung open with the sound of a cockroach's\nshell crunching underfoot. The blade was rusty.\n\nAlan flung his freed arm across his body and tried to tug himself\nloose. He was being held down by his own sheets, which had been tacked\nor stapled to the bed frame. Using all his strength, he rolled over,\nheaving and bucking, and felt\/heard the staples popping free down one\nside of the bed, just as Davey slashed at where his face had been a\nmoment before. The knife whistled past his ear, then scored deeply along\nhis shoulder. His arm flopped uselessly at his side and now they were\nboth fighting one-armed, though Davey had a knife and Adam was wrapped\nin a sheet.\n\nHis bedroom was singularly lacking in anything that could be improvised\ninto a weapon -- he considered trying getting a heavy encyclopedia out\nto use as a shield, but it was too far a distance and too long a shot.\n\nHe scooted back on the bed, trying to untangle the sheet, which was\nstill secured at the foot of the bed and all along one side. He freed\nhis good arm just as Davey slashed at him again, aiming for the meat of\nhis thigh, the big arteries there that could bleed you out in a minute\nor two. He grabbed for Davey's shoulder and caught it for an instant,\nsqueezed and twisted, but then the skin he had hold of sloughed away and\nDavey was free, dancing back.\n\nThen he heard, from downstairs, the sound of rhythmic pounding at the\ndoor. He'd been hearing it for some time, but hadn't registered it until\nnow. A muffled yell from below. Police? Mimi? He screamed out, \"Help!\"\nhoping his voice would carry through the door.\n\nApparently, it did. He heard the sound of the small glass pane over the\ndoorknob shatter, and Davey turned his head to look in the direction of\nthe sound. Alan snatched up the pillow that he'd been smothering under\nand swung it as hard as he could at Davey's head, knocking him around,\nand the door was open now, the summer night air sweeping up the stairs\nto the second-floor bedroom.\n\n\"Alan?\" It was Kurt.\n\n\"Kurt, up here, he's got a knife!\"\n\nBoots on the stairs, and Davey standing again, cornered, with the knife,\nslashing at the air toward him and toward the bedroom door, toward the\nlight coming up the stairs, bobbing, Kurt's maglight, clenched in his\nteeth, and Davey bolted for the door with the knife held high. The light\nstopped moving and there was an instant's tableau, Davey caught in the\nlight, cracked black lips peeled back from sharp teeth, chest heaving,\nknife bobbing, and then Alan was free, diving for his knees, bringing\nhim down.\n\nKurt was on them before Davey could struggle up to his good elbow,\nkicking the knife away, scattering fingerbones like dice.\n\nDavey screeched like a rusty hinge as Kurt twisted his arms up behind\nhis back and Alan took hold of his ankles. He thrashed like a raccoon in\na trap, and Alan forced the back of his head down so that his face was\nmashed against the cool floor, muffling his cries.\n\nKurt shifted so that his knee and one hand were pinning Davey's wrists,\nfished in his pockets, and came out with a bundle of hairy twine. He set\nit on the floor next to Alan and then shifted his grip back to Davey's\narms.\n\nAs soon as Alan released the back of Davey's head, he jerked it up and\nsnapped his teeth into the top of Kurt's calf, just above the top of his\nhigh, chain-draped boot. Kurt hollered and Adam reached out and took the\nknife, moving quickly before he could think, and smashed the butt into\nDavey's jaw, which cracked audibly. Davey let go of Kurt's calf and Alan\nworked quickly to lash his feet together, using half the bundle of\ntwine, heedless of how he cut into the thin, cracking skin. He used the\nknife to snip the string and then handed the roll to Kurt, who went to\nwork on Danny's wrists.\n\nAlan got the lights and rolled his brother over, looked into his mad\neyes. Dale was trying to scream, but with his jaw hanging limp and his\nteeth scattered, it came out in a rasp. Alan stood and found that he was\nnaked, his shoulder and bicep dripping blood down his side into a pool\non the polished floor.\n\n\"We'll take him to the basement,\" he told Kurt, and dug through the\nlaundry hamper at the foot of the bed for jeans. He found a couple of\npairs of boxer shorts and tied one around his bicep and the other around\nhis shoulder, using his teeth and chin as a second hand. It took two\ntries before he had them bound tight enough to still the throb.\n\nThe bedroom looked like someone had butchered an animal in it, and the\nfloor was gritty with Darrel's leavings, teeth and nails and\nfingerbones. Picking his way carefully through the mess, he hauled the\nsheet off the bed, popping out the remaining staples, which pinged off\nthe bookcases and danced on the polished wood of the floor. He folded it\ndouble and laid it on the floor next to Davey.\n\n\"Help me roll him onto it,\" he said, and then saw that Kurt was staring\ndown at his shriveled, squirming, hateful brother in horror, wiping his\nhands over and over again on the thighs of his jeans.\n\nHe looked up and his eyes were glazed and wide. \"I was passing by and I\nsaw the shadows in the window. I thought you were being attacked --\" He\nhugged himself.\n\n\"I was,\" Alan said. He dug another T-shirt out of his hamper. \"Here,\nwrap this around your hands.\"\n\nThey rolled Davey into the sheet and then wrapped him in it. He was\nsurprisingly heavy, dense. Hefting his end of the sheet one-handed,\nhefting that mysterious weight, he remembered picking up Ed-Fred-Geoff\nin the cave that first day, remembered the weight of the\nbrother-in-the-brother-in-the-brother, and he had a sudden sickening\nsense that perhaps Davey was so heavy because he'd eaten them.\n\nOnce they had him bound snugly in the sheet, Danny stopped thrashing and\nbecame very still. They carried him carefully down the dark stairs, the\nwalnut-shell grit echoing the feel of teeth and flakes of skin on the\nbare soles of Alan's feet.\n\nThey dumped him unceremoniously on the cool mosaic of tile on the\nfloor. They stared at the unmoving bundle for a moment. \"Wait here, I'm\ngoing to get a chair,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Jesus, don't leave me alone here,\" Kurt said. \"That kid, the one who\nsaw him -- take -- your brother? No one's seen him since.\" He looked\ndown at Davey with wide, crazed eyes.\n\nAlan's shoulder throbbed. \"All right,\" he said. \"You get a chair from\nthe kitchen, the captain's chair in the corner with the newspaper\nrecycling stacked on it.\"\n\nWhile Kurt was upstairs, Alan unwrapped his brother. Danny's eyes were\nclosed, his jaw hanging askew, his wrists bound behind him. Alan leaned\ncarefully over him and took his jaw and rotated it gently until it\npopped back into place.\n\n\"Davey?\" he said. The eyes were closed, but now there was an\nattentiveness, an alertness to him. Alan stepped back quickly, feeling\nfoolish at his fear of this pathetic, disjointed bound thing on his\nfloor. No two ways about it, though: Davey gave him the absolutely\nwillies, making his testicles draw up and the hair on the back of his\narms prickle.\n\n\"Set the chair down there,\" Alan said, pointing. He hoisted Davey up by\nhis dry, papery armpits and sat him in the seat. He took some duct tape\nout of a utility drawer under the basement staircase and used it to gum\nDanny down in the chair.\n\n\"Davey,\" he said again. \"I know you can hear me. Stop pretending.\"\n\n\"That's your brother?\" Kurt said. \"The one who --\"\n\n\"That's him,\" Alan said. \"I guess you believe me now, huh?\"\n\nDavey grinned suddenly, mirthless. \"Still making friends and influencing\npeople, brother?\" he said. His voice was wet and hiccuping, like he was\ndrowning in snot.\n\n\"We're not going to play any games here, Davey. You're going to tell me\nwhere Edward, Felix, and Griffin are, or I'm going to tear your fingers\noff and smash them into powder. When I run out of fingers, I'll switch\nto teeth.\"\n\nKurt looked at him in alarm. He moaned. \"Jesus, Adam --\"\n\nAdam whirled on him, something snapping inside. \"Don't, Kurt, just\ndon't, okay? He tried to kill me tonight. He may already have killed my\nbrothers. This is life or death, and there's no room for sentiment or\nhumanity. Get a hammer out of the toolbox, on that shelf.\" Kurt\nhesitated. \"Do it!\" Alan said, pointing at the toolbox.\n\nKurt shrank back, looking as though he'd been slapped. He moved as if in\na dream, opening the toolbox and pawing through it until he came up with\na scarred hammer, one claw snapped off.\n\nDavey shook his head. \"You don't scare me, Albert. Not for an instant. I\nhave a large supply of fingers and teeth -- all I need. And you --\nyou're like him. You're a sentimentalist. Scared of yourself. Scared of\nme. Scared of everything. That's why you ran away. That's why you got\nrid of me. Scared.\"\n\nAlan dug in his pocket for the fingerbones and teeth he'd collected. He\nfound the tip of a pinky with a curled-over nail as thick as an oyster's\nshell, crusted with dirt and blood. \"Give me the hammer, Kurt,\" he said.\n\nDavey's eyes followed him as he set the fingertip down on the tiles and\nraised the hammer. He brought it down just to one side of the finger,\nhard enough to break the tile. Kurt jumped a little, and Alan held the\nhammer up again.\n\n\"Tell me or this time I won't miss,\" he said, looking Davey in the eye.\n\nDavey shrugged in his bonds.\n\nAlan swung the hammer again. It hit the fingertip with a jarring impact\nthat vibrated up his arm and resonated through his hurt shoulder. He\nraised the hammer again. He'd expected the finger to crush into powder,\nbut instead it fissured into three jagged pieces, like a piece of chert\nfracturing under a hammer-stone.\n\nDavey's eyes were squeezed down to slits now. \"You're the scared\none. You can't scare me,\" he said, his voice choked with phlegm.\n\nAlan sat on the irregular tile and propped his chin in his palm. \"Okay,\nDavey, you're right. I'm scared. You've kidnapped our brothers, maybe\neven killed them. You're terrorizing me. I can't think, I can't\nsleep. So tell me, Danny, why shouldn't I just kill you again, and get\nrid of all that fear?\"\n\n\"I know where the brothers are,\" he said instantly. \"I know where there\nare more people like us. All the answers, Albert, every answer you've\never looked for. I've got them. And I won't tell you any of them. But so\nlong as I'm walking around and talking, you think that I might.\"\n\n#\n\nAlan took Marci back to his bedroom, the winter bedroom that was no more\nthan a niche in the hot-spring cavern, a pile of rags and a sleeping bag\nfor a bed. It had always been enough for him, but now he was ashamed of\nit. He took the flashlight from Marci and let it wind down, so that they\nwere sitting in darkness.\n\n\"Your parents --\" she said, then broke off.\n\n\"It's complicated.\"\n\n\"Are they dead?\"\n\nHe reached out in the dark and took her hand.\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it,\" he said. \"I can lie, and you'll\nprobably think I'm telling the truth. Or I can tell the truth, and\nyou'll think that I'm lying.\"\n\nShe squeezed his hand. Despite the sweaty heat of the cave, her fingers\nwere cold as ice. He covered her hand with his free hand and rubbed at\nher cold fingers.\n\n\"Tell me the truth,\" she whispered. \"I'll believe you.\"\n\nSo he did, in mutters and whispers. He didn't have the words to explain\nit all, didn't know exactly how to explain it, but he tried. How he knew\nhis father's moods. How he felt his mother's love.\n\nAfter keeping this secret all his life, it felt incredible to be letting\nit out. His heart thudded in his chest, and his shoulders felt\nprogressively lighter, until he thought he might rise up off his bedding\nand fly around the cave.\n\nIf it hadn't been dark, he wouldn't have been able to tell it. It was\nthe dark, and the faint lunar glow of Marci's face that showed no\nexpression that let him open up and spill out all the secrets. Her\nfingers squeezed tighter and tighter, and now he felt like singing and\ndancing, because surely between the two of them, they could find a book\nin the library or maybe an article in the microfilm cabinets that would\n*really* explain it to him.\n\nHe wound down. \"No one else knows this,\" he said. \"No one except you.\"\nHe leaned in and planted a kiss on her cold lips. She sat rigid and\nunmoving as he kissed her.\n\n\"Marci?\"\n\n\"Alan,\" she breathed. Her fingers went slack. She pulled her hand free.\n\nSuddenly Alan was cold, too. The scant inches between them felt like an\nunbridgeable gap.\n\n\"You think I'm lying,\" he said, staring out into the cave.\n\n\"I don't know --\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" he said. \"I can help you get home now, all right?\"\n\nShe folded her hands on her lap and nodded miserably.\n\nOn the way out of the cave, Eddie-Freddie-Georgie tottered over, still\nholding his car. He held it out to her mutely. She knelt down solemnly\nand took it from him, then patted him on the head. \"Merry Christmas,\nkiddo,\" she said. He hugged her leg, and she laughed a little and bent\nto pick him up. She couldn't. He was too heavy. She let go of him and\nnervously pried his arms from around her thigh.\n\nAlan took her down the path to the side road that led into town. The\nmoonlight shone on the white snow, making the world glow bluish. They\nstood by the roadside for a long and awkward moment.\n\n\"Good night, Alan,\" she said, and turned and started trudging home.\n\n#\n\nThere was no torture at school the next day. She ignored him through the\nmorning, and he couldn't find her at recess, but at lunch she came and\nsat next to him. They ate in silence, but he was comforted by her\npresence beside him, a warmth that he sensed more than felt.\n\nShe sat beside him in afternoon classes, too. Not a word passed between\nthem. For Alan, it felt like anything they could say to one another\nwould be less true than the silence, but that realization hurt. He'd\nnever been able to discuss his life and nature with anyone and it seemed\nas though he never would.\n\nBut the next morning, in the school yard, she snagged him as he walked\npast the climber made from a jumble of bolted-together logs and dragged\nhim into the middle. It smelled faintly of pee and was a rich source of\nmysterious roaches and empty beer bottles on Monday mornings after the\nteenagers had come and gone.\n\nShe was crouched down on her haunches in the snow there, her steaming\nbreath coming in short huffs. She grabbed him by the back of his knit\ntoque and pulled his face to hers, kissing him hard on the mouth,\nshocking the hell out of him by forcing her tongue past his lips.\n\nThey kissed until the bell rang, and as Alan made his way to class, he\nfelt like his face was glowing like a lightbulb. His homeroom teacher\nasked him if he was feeling well, and he stammered out some kind of\naffirmative while Marci, sitting in the next row, stifled a giggle.\n\nThey ate their lunches together again, and she filled the silence with a\nrunning commentary of the deficiencies of the sandwich her father had\npacked her, the strange odors coming from the brown bag that Alan had\nbrought, filled with winter mushrooms and some soggy bread and cheese,\nand the hairiness of the mole on the lunch lady's chin.\n\nWhen they reached the schoolyard, she tried to drag him back to the\nlogs, but he resisted, taking her instead to the marsh where he'd first\nspied her. The ground had frozen over and the rushes and reeds were\nstubble, poking out of the snow. He took her mittened hands in his and\nwaited for her to stop squirming.\n\nWhich she did, eventually. He'd rehearsed what he'd say to her all\nmorning: *Do you believe me? What am I? Am I like you? Do you still love\nme? Are you still my friend? I don't understand it any better than you\ndo, but now, now there are two of us who know about it, and maybe we can\nmake sense of it together. God, it's such a relief to not be the only\none anymore.*\n\nBut now, standing there with Marci, in the distant catcalls of the\nplayground and the smell of the new snow and the soughing of the wind in\nthe trees, he couldn't bring himself to say it. She either knew these\nthings or she didn't, and if she didn't, he didn't know what he could do\nto help it.\n\n\"What?\" she said at last.\n\n\"Do you --\" he began, then fell silent. He couldn't say the words.\n\nShe looked irritated, and the sounds and the smells swept over him as\nthe moment stretched. But then she softened. \"I don't understand it,\nAlan,\" she said. \"Is it true? Is it really how you say it is? Did I see\nwhat I saw?\"\n\n\"It's true,\" he said, and it was as though the clouds had parted, the\nworld gone bright with the glare off the snow and the sounds from the\nplayground now joyous instead of cruel. \"It's true, and I don't\nunderstand it any more than you do, Marci.\"\n\n\"Are you...*human*, Alan?\"\n\n\"I *think* so,\" he said. \"I bleed. I eat. I sleep. I think and talk and\ndream.\"\n\nShe squeezed his hands and darted a kiss at him. \"You kiss,\" she said.\n\nAnd it was all right again.\n\n#\n\nThe next day was Saturday, and Marci arranged to meet him at the\ncave-mouth. In the lee of the wind, the bright winter sun reflected\nenough heat off the snow that some of it melted away, revealing the\nstunted winter grass beneath. They sat on the dry snow and listened to\nthe wind whistle through the pines and the hiss of loose snow blowing\nacross the crust.\n\n\"Will I get to meet your Da, then?\" she said, after they'd watched a\njackrabbit hop up the mountainside and disappear into the woods.\n\nHe sniffed deeply, and smelled the coalface smell of his father's\ncogitation.\n\n\"You want to?\" he said.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nAnd so he led her inside the mountain, through the winter cave, and back\nand back to the pool in the mountain's heart. They crept along quietly,\nher fingers twined in his. \"You have to put out the flashlight now,\" he\nsaid. \"It'll scare the goblin.\" His voice shocked him, and her, he felt\nher startle. It was so quiet otherwise, just the sounds of breathing and\nof cave winds.\n\nSo she let the whirring dynamo in the flashlight wind down, and the\ndarkness descended on them. It was cool, but not cold, and the wind\nsmelled more strongly of coalface than ever. \"He's in there,\" Alan\nsaid. He heard the goblin scamper away. His words echoed over the pool\naround the corner. \"Come on.\" Her fingers were very cool. They walked in\na slow, measured step, like a king and queen of elfland going for a walk\nin the woods.\n\nHe stopped them at the pool's edge. There was almost no light here, but\nAlan could make out the smooth surface of his father's pool.\n\n\"Now what?\" she whispered, the hissing of her words susurrating over the\npool's surface.\n\n\"We can only talk to him from the center,\" he whispered. \"We have to\nwade in.\"\n\n\"I can't go home with wet clothes,\" she whispered.\n\n\"You don't wear clothes,\" he said. He let go of her hand and began to\nunzip his snowsuit.\n\nAnd so they stripped, there on his father's shore. She was luminous in\nthe dark, a pale girl-shape picked out in the ripples of the pool,\nskinny, with her arms crossed in front of her chest. Even though he knew\nshe couldn't see him, he was self-conscious in his nudity, and he\nstepped into the pool as soon as he was naked.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, sounding panicked. \"Don't leave me!\"\n\nSo he held out his hand for her, and then, realizing that she couldn't\nsee it, he stepped out of the pool and took her hand, brushing her small\nbreast as he did so. He barely registered the contact, though she\nstartled and nearly fell over. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\n\nThe water was cold, but once they were in up to their shoulders, it\nwarmed up, or they went numb.\n\n\"Is it okay?\" she whispered, and now that they were in the center of the\ncavern, the echoes crossed back and forth and took a long time to die\nout.\n\n\"Listen,\" Andy said. \"Just listen.\"\n\nAnd as the echoes of his words died down, the winds picked up, and then\nthe words emerged from the breeze.\n\n\"Adam,\" his father sighed. Marci jumped a foot out of the water, and her\nsplashdown sent watery ripples rebounding off the cavern walls.\n\nAlan reached out for her and draped his arm around her shoulders. She\nhuddled against his chest, slick cold naked skin goose-pimpled against\nhis ribs. She smelled wonderful, like a fox. It *felt* wonderful, and\nsolemn, to stand there nude, in the heart of his father, and let his\nsecrets spill away.\n\nHer breathing stilled again.\n\n\"Alan,\" his father said.\n\n\"We want to understand, Father,\" Alan whispered. \"What am I?\" It was the\nquestion he'd never asked. Now that he'd asked it, he felt like a fool:\nSurely his father *knew*, the mountain knew everything, had stood\nforever. He could have found out anytime he'd thought to ask.\n\n\"I don't have the answer,\" his father said. \"There may be no answer. You\nmay never know.\"\n\nAdam let go of Marci, let his arms fall to his sides.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"No!\" he shouted again, and the stillness was broken. The\nwind blew cold and hard, and he didn't care. \"*NO!*\" he screamed, and\nMarci grabbed him and put her hand over his mouth. His ears roared with\nechoes, and they did not die down, but rather built atop one another, to\na wall of noise that scared him.\n\nShe was crying now, scared and openmouthed sobs. She splashed him and\nwater went up his nose and stung his eyes. The wind was colder now, cold\nenough to hurt, and he took her hand and sloshed recklessly for the\nshore. He spun up the flashlight and handed it to her, then yanked his\nclothes over his wet skin, glaring at the pool while she did the same.\n\n#\n\nIn the winter cave, they met a golem.\n\nIt stood like a statue, brick-red with glowing eyes, beside Alan's\nmother, hands at its sides. Golems didn't venture to this side of his\nfather very often, and almost never in daylight. Marci caught him in the\nflashlight's beam as they entered the warm humidity of the cave,\nshivering in the gusting winds. She fumbled the flashlight and Alan\ncaught it before it hit the ground.\n\n\"It's okay,\" he said. His chest was heaving from his tantrum, but the\npresence of the golem calmed him. You could say or do anything to a\ngolem, and it couldn't strike back, couldn't answer back. The sons of\nthe mountain that sheltered -- and birthed? -- the golems owed nothing\nto them.\n\nHe walked over to it and folded his arms.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said.\n\nThe golem bent its head slightly and looked him in the eye. It was\nman-shaped, but baggier, muscles like frozen mud. An overhang of belly\ncovered its smooth crotch like a kilt. Its chisel-shaped teeth clacked\ntogether as it limbered up its jaw.\n\n\"Your father is sad,\" it said. Its voice was slow and grinding, like an\navalanche. \"Our side grows cold.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" Alan said. \"*Fuck* my father,\" he said. Behind him,\nperched atop their mother, Davey whittered a mean little laugh.\n\n\"You shouldn't --\"\n\nAlan shoved the golem. It was like shoving a boulder. It didn't give at\nall.\n\n\"You don't tell me what to do,\" he said. \"You can't tell me what to\ndo. I want to know what I am, how we're possible, and if you can't help,\nthen you can leave now.\"\n\nThe winds blew colder, smelling now of the golem's side of the mountain,\nof clay and the dry bones of their kills, which they arrayed on the\nwalls of their cavern.\n\nThe golem stood stock still.\n\n\"Does it...*understand*?\" Marci asked. Davey snickered again.\n\n\"It's not stupid,\" Alan said, calming a little. \"It's...*slow*. It\nthinks slowly and acts slowly. But it's not stupid.\" He paused for a\nmoment. \"It taught me to speak,\" he said.\n\nThat did it. He began to cry, biting his lip to keep from making a\nsound, but the tears rolled down his cheeks and his shoulders shook. The\nflashlight's beam pinned him, and he wanted to run to his mother and\nhide behind her, wanted to escape the light.\n\n\"Go,\" he said softly to the golem, touching its elbow. \"It'll be all\nright.\"\n\nSlowly, gratingly, the golem turned and lumbered out of the cave, clumsy\nand ponderous.\n\nMarci put her arm around him and he buried his face in her skinny neck,\nthe hot tears coursing down her collarbones.\n\n#\n\nDavey came to him that night and pinned him in the light of the\nflashlight. He woke staring up into the bright bulb, shielding his\neyes. He groped out for the light, but Darryl danced back out of reach,\nkeeping the beam in his eyes. The air crackled with the angry grinding\nof its hand-dynamo.\n\nHe climbed out of bed naked and felt around on the floor. He had a geode\nthere, he'd broken it and polished it by hand, and it was the size of a\nsoftball, the top smooth as glass, the underside rough as a coconut's\nhide.\n\nWordless and swift, he wound up and threw the geode as hard as he could\nat where he judged Davey's head to be.\n\nThere was a thud and a cry, and the light clattered to the ground,\ngrowing more dim as its dynamo whirred to a stop. Green blobs chased\nthemselves across his vision, and he could only see Darren rolling on\nthe ground by turning his head to one side and looking out of the corner\nof his eye.\n\nHe groped toward Davey and smelled the blood. Kneeling down, he found\nDavey's hand and followed it up to his shoulder, his neck. Slick with\nblood. Higher, to Davey's face, his forehead, the dent there sanded\nragged by the rough side of the geode. The blood flowed freely and\nbeneath his other hand Danny's chest heaved as he breathed, shallowly,\nrapidly, almost panting.\n\nHis vision was coming back now. He took off his T-shirt and wadded it\nup, pressed it to Davey's forehead. They'd done first aid in class. You\nweren't supposed to move someone with a head injury. He pressed down\nwith the T-shirt, trying to stanch the blood.\n\nThen, quick as a whip, Davey's head twisted around and he bit down,\nhard, on Alan's thumbtip. Albert reeled back, but it was too late: Davey\nhad bitten off the tip of his right thumb. Alan howled, waking up\nEd-Fred-Geoff, who began to cry. Davey rolled away, scampering back into\nthe cave's depths.\n\nAlan danced around the cave, hand clamped between his thighs,\nmewling. He fell to the floor and squeezed his legs together, then\nslowly brought his hand up before his face. The ragged stump of his\nthumb was softly spurting blood in time with his heartbeat. He struggled\nto remember his first aid. He wrapped his T-shirt around the wound and\nthen pulled his parka on over his bare chest and jammed his bare feet\ninto his boots, then made his way to the cave mouth and scooped up snow\nunder the moon's glow, awkwardly packing a snowball around his hand. He\nshivered as he made his way back into the winter cave and propped\nhimself up against his mother, holding his hurt hand over his head.\n\nThe winter cave grew cold as the ice packed around his hand. Bobby,\nwoken by his clairvoyant instincts, crept forward with a sheet and\ndraped it over Alan. He'd foreseen this, of course -- had foreseen all\nof it. But Bobby followed his own code, and he kept his own counsel,\ncleaning up after the disasters he was powerless to prevent.\n\nDeep in the mountains, they heard the echoes of Davey's tittering\nlaughter.\n\n#\n\n\"It was wrong to bring her here, Adam,\" Billy said to him in the\nmorning, as he fed Alan the crusts of bread and dried apples he'd\nbrought him, packing his hand with fresh snow.\n\n\"I didn't bring her here, she followed me,\" Adam said. His arm ached\nfrom holding it aloft, and his back and tailbone were numb with the ache\nof a night spent sitting up against their mother's side. \"And besides,\nwhy should it be wrong? Whose rules? What rules? What are the *fucking*\nrules?\"\n\n\"You can feel the rules, brother,\" he said. He couldn't look Alan in the\neye, he never did. This was a major speech, coming from Bobby.\n\n\"I can't feel any rules,\" Alan said. He wondered if it was true. He'd\nnever told anyone about the family before. Had he known all along that\nhe shouldn't do this?\n\n\"I can. She can't know. No one can know. Even we can't know. We'll never\nunderstand it.\"\n\n\"Where is Davey?\"\n\n\"He's doing a...ritual. With your thumb.\"\n\nThey sat silent and strained their ears to hear the winds and the\ndistant shuffle of the denizens of the mountain.\n\nAlan shifted, using his good hand to prop himself up, looking for a\ncomfortable position. He brought his injured hand down to his lap and\nunwrapped his blood-soaked T-shirt from his fist, gently peeling it away\nfrom the glue of dried blood that held it there.\n\nHis hand had shriveled in the night, from ice and from restricted\ncirculation, and maybe from Davey's ritual. Alan pondered its crusty,\nclawed form, thinking that it looked like it belonged to someone --\nsome*thing* -- else.\n\nBuddy scaled the stalactite that served as the ladder up to the lofty\nnook where he slept and came back down holding his water bottle. \"It's\nclean, it's from the pool,\" he said, another major speech for him. He\nalso had an armload of scavenged diapers, much-washed and worn soft as\nflannel. He wet one and began to wipe away the crust of blood on Alan's\narm and hand, working his way up from the elbow, then tackling the\nuninjured fingers, then, very gently, gently as a feather-touch, slow as\na glacier, he worked on Alan's thumb.\n\nWhen he was done, Alan's hand was clean and dry and cold, and the wound\nof his thumb was exposed and naked, a thin crust of blood weeping liquid\nslowly. It seemed to Alan that he could see the stump of bone protruding\nfrom the wound. He was amazed to see his bones, to get a look at a\ncross-section of himself. He wondered if he could count the rings and\nfind out how old he was, as he had never been really certain on that\nscore. He giggled ghoulishly.\n\nHe held out his good hand. \"Get me up, okay?\" Bobby hauled him to his\nfeet. \"Get me some warm clothes, too?\"\n\nAnd he did, because he was Bobby, and he was always only too glad to\nhelp, only too glad to do what service he could for you, even if he\nwould never do you the one service that would benefit you the most:\ntelling you of his visions, helping you avoid the disasters that loomed\non your horizon.\n\nStanding up, walking around, being clean -- he began to feel like\nhimself again. He even managed to get into his snow pants and parka and\nstruggle out to the hillside and the bright sunshine, where he could get\na good look at his hand.\n\nWhat he had taken for a bone wasn't. It was a skinny little thumbtip,\ngrowing out of the raggedy, crusty stump. He could see the whorl of a\nfingerprint there, and narrow, nearly invisible cuticles. He touched the\ntip of his tongue to it and it seemed to him that he could feel a tongue\nrasping over the top of his missing thumbtip.\n\n#\n\n\"It's disgusting, keep it away,\" Marci said, shrinking away from his\nhand in mock horror. He held his proto-thumb under her nose and waggled\nit.\n\n\"No joking, okay? I just want to know what it *means*. I'm *growing a\nnew thumb*.\"\n\n\"Maybe you're part salamander. They regrow their legs and tails. Or a\nworm -- cut a worm in half and you get two worms. It's in one of my Da's\nbooks.\"\n\nHe stared at his thumb. It had grown perceptibly, just on the journey\ninto town to Marci's place. They were holed up in her room, surrounded\nby watercolors of horses in motion that her mother had painted. She'd\nraided the fridge for cold pork pies and cheese and fizzy lemonade that\nher father had shipped from the Marks & Spencer in Toronto. It was the\nstrangest food he'd ever eaten but he'd developed a taste for it.\n\n\"Wiggle it again,\" she said.\n\nHe did, and the thumbtip bent down like a scale model of a thumbtip,\ncracking the scab around it.\n\n\"We should go to a doctor,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't go to doctors,\" he said flatly.\n\n\"You *haven't* gone to a doctor -- doesn't mean you can't.\"\n\n\"I don't go to doctors.\" X-ray machines and stethoscopes, blood tests\nand clever little flashlights in your ears -- who knew what they'd\nreveal? He wanted to be the first to discover it, he didn't want to have\nto try to explain it to a doctor before he understood it himself.\n\n\"Not even when you're sick?\"\n\n\"The golems take care of it,\" he said.\n\nShe shook her head. \"You're a weirdo, you know that?\"\n\n\"I know it,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought my family was strange,\" she said, stretching out on her tummy\non the bed. \"But they're not a patch on you.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\nHe finished his fizzy lemonade and lay down beside her, belching.\n\n\"We could ask my Da. He knows a lot of strange things.\"\n\nHe put his face down in her duvet and smelled the cotton covers and her\nnighttime sweat, like a spice, like cinnamon. \"I don't want to do\nthat. Please don't tell anyone, all right?\"\n\nShe took hold of his wrist and looked again at the teensy thumb. \"Wiggle\nit again,\" she said. He did. She giggled. \"Imagine if you were like a\nworm. Imagine if your thumbtip was out there growing another *you*.\"\n\nHe sat bolt upright. \"Do you think that's possible?\" he said. His heart\nwas thudding. \"Do you think so?\"\n\nShe rolled on her side and stared at him. \"No, don't be daft. How could\nyour thumb grow another *you?*\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't it?\"\n\nShe had no answer for him.\n\n\"I need to go home,\" he said. \"I need to know.\"\n\n\"I'm coming with,\" she said. He opened his mouth to tell her no, but she\nmade a fierce face at him, her foxy features wrinkled into a mock snarl.\n\n\"Come along then,\" he said. \"You can help me do up my coat.\"\n\n#\n\nThe winter cave was deserted. He listened at the mouths of all the\ntunnels, straining to hear Davey. From his high nook, Brian watched\nthem.\n\n\"Where is he, Billy?\" Alan called. \"Tell me, godfuckit!\"\n\nBilly looked down from him perch with his sad, hollow eyes -- had he\nbeen forgetting to eat again? -- and shook his head.\n\nThey took to the tunnels. Even with the flashlight, Marci couldn't match\nhim for speed. He could feel the tunnels through the soles of his boots,\nhe could smell them, he could pick them apart by the quality of their\nechoes. He moved fast, dragging Marci along with his good hand while she\ncranked the flashlight as hard as she could. He heard her panting,\ntriangulated their location from the way that the shallow noises\nreflected off the walls.\n\nWhen they found Davey at last, it was in the golem's cave, on the other\nside of the mountain. He was hunkered down in a corner, while the golems\nmoved around him slowly, avoiding him like he was a boulder or a\nstalagmite that had sprung up in the night. Their stony heads turned to\nregard Marci and Adam as they came upon them, their luminous eyes\nlighting on them for a moment and then moving on. It was an eloquent\nstatement for them: *This is the business of the mountain and his\nsons. We will not intervene.*\n\nThere were more golems than Alan could remember seeing at once, six,\nmaybe seven. The golems made more of their kind from the clay they found\nat the riverbank whenever they cared to or needed to, and allowed their\nnumber to dwindle when the need or want had passed by the simple\nexpedient of deconstructing one of their own back to the clay it had\ncome from.\n\nThe golems' cave was lined with small bones and skulls, rank and row\nclimbing the walls, twined with dried grasses in ascending\ngeometries. These were the furry animals that the golems patiently\ntrapped and killed, skinned, dressed, and smoked, laying them in small,\nfur-wrapped bundles in the family's cave when they were done. It was\npart of their unspoken bargain with the mountain, and the tiny bones had\nonce borne the flesh of nearly every significant meal Alan had ever\neaten.\n\nDavey crouched among the bones at the very back of the cave, his back to\nthem, shoulders hunched.\n\nThe golems stood stock still as Marci and he crept up on Davey. So\nintent was he on his work that he didn't notice them, even as they\nloomed over his shoulder, staring down on the thing he held in his\nhands.\n\nIt was Alan's thumb, and growing out of it -- Allen. Tiny, the size of a\npipe-cleaner man, and just as skinny, but perfectly formed, squirming\nand insensate, face contorted in a tiny expression of horror.\n\nNot so perfectly formed, Alan saw, once he was over the initial\nshock. One of the pipe-cleaner-Allen's arms was missing, protruding\nthere from Davey's mouth, and he crunched it with lip-smacking\nrelish. Alan gawped at it, taking it in, watching his miniature\ndoppelganger, hardly bigger than the thumb it sprouted from, thrash like\na worm on a hook.\n\nDavey finished the arm, slurping it back like a noodle. Then he dangled\nthe tiny Allen from the thumb, shaking it, before taking hold of the\nlegs, one between the thumb and forefinger of each hand, and he gently,\nalmost lovingly pulled them apart. The Allen screamed, a sound as tiny\nand tortured as a cricket song, and then the left leg wrenched free of\nits socket. Alan felt his own leg twist in sympathy, and then there was\na killing rage in him. He looked around the cave for the thing that\nwould let him murder his brother for once and for all, but it wasn't to\nbe found.\n\nDavey's murder was still to come.\n\nInstead, he leapt on Davey's back, arm around his neck, hand gripping\nhis choking fist, pulling the headlock tighter and tighter. Marci was\nscreaming something, but she was lost in the crash of the blood-surf\nthat roared in his ears. Davey pitched over backward, trying to buck him\noff, but he wouldn't be thrown, and he flipped Davey over by the neck,\nso that he landed it a thrash of skinny arms and legs. The Allen fell to\nthe floor, weeping and dragging itself one-armed and one-legged away\nfrom the melee.\n\nThen Davey was on him, squeezing his injured hand, other thumb in his\neye, screeching like a rusted hinge. Alan tried to see through the tears\nthat sprang up, tried to reach Davey with his good hand, but the rage\nwas leaking out of him now. He rolled desperately, but Davey's weight on\nhis chest was like a cannonball, impossibly heavy.\n\nSuddenly Davey was lifted off of him. Alan struggled up into a sitting\nposition, clutching his injured hand. Davey dangled by his armpits in\nthe implacable hands of one of the golems, face contorted into\nunrecognizability. Alan stood and confronted him, just out of range of\nhis kicking feet and his gnashing teeth, and Darrel spat in his face, a\nsearing gob that landed in his eye.\n\nMarci took his arm and dragged him back toward the cave mouth. He fought\nher, looking for the little Allen, not seeing him. Was that him, there,\nin the shadows? No, that was one of the little bone tableaux, a field\nmouse's dried bones splayed in an anatomically correct mystic\nhieroglyph.\n\nMarci hauled him away, out into the bright snow and the bright sun. His\nthumb was bleeding anew, dripping fat drops the color of a red crayon\ninto the sun, blood so hot it seemed to sizzle and sink into the snow.\n\n#\n\n\"You need to tell an adult, Alan,\" she said, wrapping his new little\nthumb in gauze she'd taken from her pocket.\n\n\"My father knows. My mother knows.\" He sat with his head between his\nknees, not daring to look at her, in his nook in the winter cave.\n\nShe just looked at him, squinting.\n\n\"They count,\" he said. \"They understand it.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"They understand it better than any adult you know would. This will get\nbetter on its own, Marci. Look.\" He wiggled his thumb at her. It was now\nthe size of the tip of his pinky, and had a well-formed nail and\ncuticle.\n\n\"That's not all that has to get better,\" she said. \"You can't just let\nthis fester. Your brother. That *thing* in the cave...\" She shook her\nhead. \"Someone needs to know about this. You're not safe.\"\n\n\"Promise me you won't tell anyone, Marci. This is important. No one\nexcept you knows, and that's how it has to be. If you tell --\"\n\n\"What?\" She got up and pulled her coat on. \"What, Alan? If I tell and\ntry to help you, what will you do to me?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he mumbled into his chest.\n\n\"Well, you do whatever you have to do,\" she said, and stomped out of the\ncave.\n\n#\n\nDavey escaped at dawn. Kurt had gone outside to repark his old Buick,\nthe trunk bungeed shut over his haul of LCD flat panels, empty\nlaser-toner cartridges, and open gift baskets of pricey Japanese\ncosmetics. Alan and Davey just glared at each other, but then Davey\nclosed his eyes and began to snore softly, and even though Alan paced\nand pinched the bridge of his nose and stretched out his injured arm, he\ncouldn't help it when he sat down and closed his eyes and nodded off.\n\nAlan woke with a start, staring at the empty loops of duct tape and\ntwine hanging from his captain's chair, dried strings of skin like\ndesiccated banana peel fibers hanging from them. He swore to himself\nquietly, and shouted Shit! at the low basement ceiling. He couldn't have\nbeen asleep for more than a few seconds, and the half-window that Davey\nhad escaped through gaped open at him like a sneer.\n\nHe tottered to his feet and went out to find Kurt, bare feet jammed into\nsneakers, bare chest and bandages covered up with a jacket. He found\nKurt cutting through the park, dragging his heels in the bloody dawn\nlight.\n\nKurt looked at his expression, then said, \"What happened?\" He had his\nfists at his sides, he looked tensed to run. Alan felt that he was\nwaiting for an order.\n\n\"He got away.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nAlan shook his head. \"Can you help me get dressed? I don't think I can\nget a shirt on by myself.\"\n\nThey went to the Greek's, waiting out front on the curb for the old man\nto show up and unchain the chairs and drag them out around the table. He\nserved them tall coffees and omelets sleepily, and they ate in silence,\ntoo tired to talk.\n\n\"Let me take you to the doctor?\" Kurt asked, nodding at the bandage that\nbulged under his shirt.\n\n\"No,\" Alan said. \"I'm a fast healer.\"\n\nKurt rubbed at his calf and winced. \"He broke the skin,\" he said.\n\n\"You got all your shots?\"\n\n\"Hell yeah. Too much crap in the dumpsters. I once found a styro cooler\nof smashed blood vials in a Red Cross trash.\"\n\n\"You'll be okay, then,\" Alan said. He shifted in his seat and winced. He\ngrunted a little ouch. Kurt narrowed his eyes and shook his head at him.\n\n\"This is pretty fucked up right here,\" Kurt said, looking down into his\ncoffee.\n\n\"It's only a little less weird for me, if that's any comfort.\"\n\n\"It's not,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Well, that's why I don't usually tell others. You're only the second\nperson to believe it.\"\n\n\"Maybe I could meet up with the first and form a support group?\"\n\nAlan pushed his omelet away. \"You can't. She's dead.\"\n\n#\n\nDavey haunted the schoolyard. Alan had always treated the school and its\ngrounds as a safe haven, a place where he could get away from the\ninexplicable, a place where he could play at being normal.\n\nBut now Davey was everywhere, lurking in the climber, hiding in the\ntrees, peering through the tinsel-hung windows during class. Alan only\ncaught the quickest glimpses of him, but he had the sense that if he\nturned his head around quickly enough, he'd see him. Davey made himself\nscarce in the mountain, hiding in the golems' cave or one of the deep\ntunnels.\n\nMarci didn't come to class after Monday. Alan fretted every morning,\nwaiting for her to turn up. He worried that she'd told her father, or\nthat she was at home sulking, too angry to come to school, glaring at\nher Christmas tree.\n\nDavey's grin was everywhere.\n\nOn Wednesday, he got called into the vice principal's office. As he\nneared it, he heard the rumble of Marci's father's thick voice and his\nheart began to pound in his chest.\n\nHe cracked the door and put his face in the gap, looking at the two men\nthere: Mr. Davenport, the vice principal, with his gray hair growing out\nhis large ears and cavernous nostrils, sitting behind his desk, looking\nawkwardly at Marci's father, eyes bugged and bagged and bloodshot, face\nturned to the ground, looking like a different man, the picture of worry\nand loss.\n\nMr. Davenport saw him and crooked a finger at him, looking stern and\nstony. Alan was sure, then, that Marci'd told it all to her father,\nwho'd told it all to Mr. Davenport, who would tell the world, and\nsuddenly he was jealous of his secret, couldn't bear to have it\nrevealed, couldn't bear the thought of men coming to the mountain to\ncatalogue it for the subject index at the library, to study him and take\nhim apart.\n\nAnd he was... afraid. Not of what they'd all do to him. What Davey would\ndo to them. He knew, suddenly, that Davey would not abide their secrets\nbeing disclosed.\n\nHe forced himself forward, his feet dragging like millstones, and stood\nbetween the two men, hands in his pockets, nervously twining at his\nunderwear.\n\n\"Alan,\" Marci's father croaked. Mr. Davenport held up a hand to silence\nhim.\n\n\"Alan,\" Mr. Davenport said. \"Have you seen Marci?\"\n\nAlan had been prepared to deny everything, call Marci a liar, betray her\nas she'd betrayed him, make it her word against his. Protect\nher. Protect her father and the school and the town from what Davey\nwould do.\n\nNow he whipped his head toward Marci's father, suddenly understanding.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Not all week! Is she all right?\"\n\nMarci's father sobbed, a sound Alan had never heard an adult make.\n\nAnd it came tumbling out. No one had seen Marci since Sunday night. Her\npresumed whereabouts had moved from a friend's place to Alan's place to\nrunaway to fallen in a lake to hit by a car and motionless in a ditch,\nand if Alan hadn't seen her --\n\n\"I haven't,\" Alan said. \"Not since the weekend. Sunday morning. She said\nshe was going home.\"\n\nAnother new sound, the sound of an adult crying. Marci's father, and his\nsobs made his chest shake and Mr. Davenport awkwardly came from behind\nhis desk and set a box of kleenexes on the hard bench beside him.\n\nAlan caught Mr. Davenport's eye and the vice principal made a shoo and\npointed at the door.\n\n#\n\nAlan didn't bother going back to class. He went straight to the golems'\ncave, straight to where he knew Davey would be -- must be -- hiding, and\nfound him there, playing with the bones that lined the walls.\n\n\"Where is she?\" Alan said, after he'd taken hold of Davey's hair and,\nwithout fanfare, smashed his face into the cold stone floor hard enough\nto break his nose. Alan twisted his wrists behind his back and when he\ntried to get up, Alan kicked his legs out from under him, wrenching his\narms in their sockets. He heard a popping sound.\n\n\"Where is she?\" Alan said again, amazing himself with his own\ncalmness. Davey was crying now, genuinely scared, it seemed, and Alan\nreveled in the feeling. \"I'll kill you,\" he whispered in Davey's ear,\nalmost lovingly. \"I'll kill you and put the body where no one will find\nit, unless you tell me where she is.\"\n\nDavey spat out a milk tooth, his right top incisor, and cried around the\nblood that coursed down his face. \"I'm -- I'm *sorry,* Alan,\" he\nsaid. \"But it was the *secret*.\" His sobs were louder and harsher than\nMarci's father's had been.\n\n\"Where is she?\" Alan said, knowing.\n\n\"With Caleb,\" Davey said. \"I buried her in Caleb.\"\n\nHe found his brother the island midway down the mountain, sliding under\ncover of winter for the seaway. He climbed the island's slope, making\nfor the ring of footprints in the snow, the snow peppered brown with\nsoil and green with grass, and he dug with his hands like a dog, tossing\nsnow soil grass through his legs, digging to loose soil, digging to a\ncold hand.\n\nA cold hand, protruding from the snow now, from the soil, some of the\nsnow red-brown with blood. A skinny, freckled hand, a fingernail\nmissing, torn off leaving behind an impression, an inverse fingernail. A\nhand, an arm. Not attached to anything. He set it to one side, dug,\nfound another hand. Another arm. A leg. A head.\n\nShe was beaten, bruised, eyes swollen and two teeth missing, ear torn,\nhair caked with blood. Her beautiful head fell from his shaking cold\nhands. He didn't want to dig anymore, but he had to, because it was the\nsecret, and it had to be kept, and --\n\n-- he buried her in Caleb, piled dirt grass snow on her parts, and his\n   eyes were dry and he didn't sob.\n\n#\n\nIt was a long autumn and a long winter and a long spring that year,\nunwiring the Market. Alan fell into the familiar rhythm of the work of a\nnew venture, rising early, dossing late, always doing two or three\nthings at once: setting up meetings, sweet-talking merchants, debugging\nhis process on the fly.\n\nHis first victory came from the Greek, who was no pushover. The man was\nover seventy, and had been pouring lethal coffee and cheap beer down the\nthroats of Kensington's hipsters for decades and had steadfastly refused\nevery single crackpot scheme hatched by his customers.\n\n\"Larry,\" Andy said, \"I have a proposal for you and you're going to hate\nit.\"\n\n\"I hate it already,\" the Greek said. His dapper little mustache\ntwitched. It was not even seven a.m. yet, and the Greek was tinkering\nwith the guts of his espresso delivery system, making it emit loud\nhisses and tossing out evil congealed masses of sin-black coffee\ngrounds.\n\n\"What if I told you it wouldn't cost you anything?\"\n\n\"Maybe I'd hate it a little less.\"\n\n\"Here's the pitch,\" Alan said, taking a sip of the thick, steaming\ncoffee the Greek handed to him in a minuscule cup. He shivered as the\nstuff coated his tongue. \"Wow.\"\n\nThe Greek gave him half a smile, which was his version of roaring\nhilarity.\n\n\"Here's the pitch. Me and that punk kid, Kurt, we're working on a\ncommunity Internet project for the Market.\"\n\n\"Computers?\" the Greek said.\n\n\"Yup,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Pah,\" the Greek said.\n\nAnders nodded. \"I knew you were going to say that. But don't think of\nthis as a computer thing, okay? Think of this as a free speech\nthing. We're putting in a system to allow people all over the Market --\nand someday, maybe, the whole city -- to communicate for free, in\nprivate, without permission from anyone. They can send messages, they\ncan get information about the world, they can have conversations. It's\nlike a library and a telephone and a caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 all at once.\"\n\nLarry poured himself a coffee. \"I hate when they come in here with\ncomputers. They sit forever at their tables, and they don't talk to\nnobody, it's like having a place full of statues or zombies.\"\n\n\"Well, *sure*,\" Alan said. \"If you're all alone with a computer, you're\njust going to fall down the rabbit hole. You're in your own world and\ncut off from the rest of the world. But once you put those computers on\nthe network, they become a way to talk to anyone else in the world. For\nfree! You help us with this network -- all we want from you is\npermission to stick up a box over your sign and patch it into your\npower, you won't even know it's there -- and those customers won't be\nantisocial, they'll be socializing, over the network.\"\n\n\"You think that's what they'll do if I help them with the network?\"\n\nHe started to say, *Absolutely*, but bit it back, because Larry's\nbullshit antennae were visibly twitching. \"No, but some of them\nwill. You'll see them in here, talking, typing, typing, talking. That's\nhow it goes. The point is that we don't know how people are going to use\nthis network yet, but we know that it's a social benefit.\"\n\n\"You want to use my electricity?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah.\"\n\n\"So it's not free.\"\n\n\"Not entirely,\" Alan said. \"You got me there.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" the Greek said.\n\n\"Look, if that's a deal breaker, I'll personally come by every day and\ngive you a dollar for the juice. Come on, Larry -- the box we want to\nput in, it's just a repeater to extend the range of the network. The\nnetwork already reaches to here, but your box will help it go\nfarther. You'll be the first merchant in the Market to have one. I came\nto you first because you've been here the longest. The others look up to\nyou. They'll see it and say, 'Larry has one, it must be all right.'\"\n\nThe Greek downed his coffee and smoothed his mustache. \"You are a\nbullshit artist, huh? All right, you put your box in. If my electricity\nbills are too high, though, I take it down.\"\n\n\"That's a deal,\" Andy said. \"How about I do it this morning, before you\nget busy? Won't take more than a couple minutes.\"\n\nThe Greek's was midway between his place and Kurt's, and Kurt hardly\nstirred when he let himself in to get an access point from one of the\nchipped shelving units before going back to his place to get his ladder\nand Makita drill. It took him most of the morning to get it securely\nfastened over the sign, screws sunk deep enough into the old, spongy\nwood to survive the build up of ice and snow that would come with the\nwinter. Then he had to wire it into the sign, which took longer than he\nthought it would, too, but then it was done, and the idiot lights\nstarted blinking on the box Kurt had assembled.\n\n\"And what, exactly, are you doing up there, Al?\" Kurt said, when he\nfinally stumbled out of bed and down the road for his afternoon\nbreakfast coffee.\n\n\"Larry's letting us put up an access point,\" he said, wiping the pigeon\nshit off a wire preparatory to taping it down. He descended the ladder\nand wiped his hands off on his painter's pants. \"That'll be ten bucks,\nplease.\"\n\nKurt dug out a handful of coins and picked out enough loonies and\ntoonies to make ten dollars, and handed it over. \"You talked the Greek\ninto it?\" he hissed. \"How?\"\n\n\"I kissed his ass without insulting his intelligence.\"\n\n\"Neat trick,\" Kurt said, and they had a little partner-to-partner\nhigh-five. \"I'd better login to that thing and get it onto the network,\nhuh?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Anders said. \"I'm gonna order some lunch, lemme get you\nsomething.\"\n\n#\n\nWhat they had done, was they had hacked the shit out of those boxes that\nKurt had built in his junkyard of a storefront of an apartment.\n\n\"These work?\" Alan said. He had three of them in a big catering tub from\nhis basement that he'd sluiced clean. The base stations no longer looked\nlike they'd been built out of garbage. They'd switched to low-power\nMini-ATX motherboards that let them shrink the hardware down to small\nenough to fit in a 50-dollar all-weather junction box from Canadian\nTire.\n\nAdam vaguely recognized the day's street-kids as regulars who'd been\nhanging around the shop for some time, and they gave him the hairy\neyeball when he had the audacity to question Kurt. These kids of Kurt's\nweren't much like the kids he'd had working for him over the years. They\nmight be bright, but they were a lot...angrier. Some of the girls were\ncutters, with knife scars on their forearms. Some of the boys looked\nlike they'd been beaten up a few times too many on the streets, like\nthey were spoiling for a fight. Alan tried to unfocus his eyes when he\nwas in the front of Kurt's shop, to not see any of them too closely.\n\n\"They work,\" Kurt said. He smelled terrible, a combination of garbage\nand sweat, and he had the raccoon-eyed jitters he got when he stayed up\nall night. \"I tested them twice.\"\n\n\"You built me a spare?\" Alan said, examining the neat lines of hot glue\nthat gasketed the sturdy rubberized antennae in place, masking the\nslightly melted edges left behind by the drill press.\n\n\"You don't need a spare,\" Kurt said. Alan knew that when he got touchy\nlike this, he had to be very careful or he'd blow up, but he wasn't\ngoing to do another demo Kurt's way. They'd done exactly one of those,\nat a Toronto District School Board superintendents meeting, when Alan\nhad gotten the idea of using schools' flagpoles and backhaul as test\nbeds for building out the net. It had been a debacle, needless to\nsay. Two of the access points had been permanently installed on either\nend of Kurt's storefront and the third had been in storage for a month\nsince it was last tested.\n\nOne of the street kids, a boy with a pair of improbably enormous raver\nshoes, looked up at Alan. \"We've tested these all. They work.\"\n\nKurt puffed up and gratefully socked the kid in the shoulder. \"We did.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Adam said patiently. \"But can we make sure they work now?\"\n\n\"They'll work,\" Kurt had said when Alan told him that he wanted to test\nthe access points out before they took them to the meeting. \"It's\npractically solid-state. They're running off the standard\ndistribution. There's almost no configuration.\"\n\nWhich may or may not have been true -- it certainly sounded plausible to\nAlan's lay ear -- but it didn't change the fact that once they powered\nup the third box, the other two seized up and died. The blinking network\nlights fell still, and as Kurt hauled out an old VT-100 terminal and\nplugged it into the serial ports on the backs of his big, ugly,\nbestickered, and cig-burned PC cases, it became apparent that they had\nceased to honor all requests for routing, association, deassociation,\nDHCP leases, and the myriad of other networking services provided for by\nthe software.\n\n\"It's practically solid-state,\" Kurt said, nearly *shouted*, after he'd\npowered down the third box and found that the other two -- previously\nrouting and humming along happily -- refused to come back up into their\nknown-good state. He gave Alan a dirty look, as though his insistence on\npreflighting were the root of their problems.\n\nThe street-kid who'd spoken up had jumped when Kurt raised his voice,\nthen cringed away. Now as Kurt began to tear around the shop, looking\nthrough boxes of CDs and dropping things on the floor, the kid all but\ncowered, and the other three all looked down at the table.\n\n\"I'll just reinstall,\" Kurt said. \"That's the beauty of these\nthings. It's a standard distro, I just copy it over, and biff-bam, it'll\ncome right back up. No problem. Take me ten minutes. We've got plenty of\ntime.\"\n\nThen, five minutes later, \"Shit, I forgot that this one has a different\nmo-bo than the others.\"\n\n\"Mo-bo?\" Alan said, amused. He'd spotted the signs of something very\nfinicky gone very wrong and he'd given up any hope of actually doing the\ndemo, so he'd settled in to watch the process without rancor and to\nlearn as much as he could.\n\n\"Motherboard,\" Kurt said, reaching for a spool of blank CDs. \"Just got\nto patch the distribution, recompile, burn it to CD, and reboot, and\nwe're on the road.\"\n\nTen minutes later, \"Shit.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Alan said.\n\n\"Back off, okay?\"\n\n\"I'm going to call them and let them know we're going to be late.\"\n\n\"We're *not* going to be late,\" Kurt said, his fingers going into claws\non the keyboard.\n\n\"We're already late,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Shit,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Let's do this,\" Alan said. \"Let's bring down the two that you've got\nworking and show them those, and explain the rest.\"\n\nThey'd had a fight, and Kurt had insisted, as Alan had suspected he\nwould, that he was only a minute or two away from bringing everything\nback online. Alan kept his cool, made mental notes of the things that\nwent wrong, and put together a plan for avoiding all these problems the\nnext time around.\n\n\"Is there a spare?\" Alan said.\n\nKurt sneered and jerked a thumb at his workbench, where another junction\nbox sat, bunny-ear antennae poking out of it. Alan moved it into his\ntub. \"Great,\" he said. \"Tested, right?\"\n\n\"All permutations tested and ready to go. You know, you're not the boss\naround here.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" he said. \"Partners.\" He clapped Kurt on the shoulder,\nignoring the damp gray grimy feeling of the clammy T-shirt under his\npalm.\n\nThe shoulder under his palm sagged. \"Right,\" Kurt said. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't be,\" Alan said. \"You've been hard at it. I'll get loaded while\nyou wash up.\n\nKurt sniffed at his armpit. \"Whew,\" he said. \"Yeah, okay.\"\n\nWhen Kurt emerged from the front door of his storefront ten minutes\nlater, he looked like he'd at least made an effort. His mohawk and its\nfins were slicked back and tucked under a baseball hat, his black jeans\nwere unripped and had only one conservative chain joining the wallet in\nhis back pocket to his belt loop. Throw in a clean t-shirt advertising\nan old technology conference instead of the customary old hardcore band\nand you had an approximation of the kind of geek that everyone knew was\nin possession of secret knowledge and hence must be treated with\nattention, if not respect.\n\n\"I feel like such a dilbert,\" he said.\n\n\"You look totally disreputable,\" Alan said, hefting the tub of their\naccess points into the bed of his truck and pulling the bungees tight\naround it. \"Punk as fuck.\"\n\nKurt grinned and ducked his head. \"Stop it,\" he said. \"Flatterer.\"\n\n\"Get in the truck,\" Alan said.\n\nKurt drummed his fingers nervously on his palms the whole way to Bell\noffices. Alan grabbed his hand and stilled it. \"Stop worrying,\" he\nsaid. \"This is going to go great.\"\n\n\"I still don't understand why we're doing this,\" Kurt said. \"They're the\nphone company. They hate us, we hate them. Can't we just leave it that\nway?\"\n\n\"Don't worry, we'll still all hate each other when we get done.\"\n\n\"So why bother?\" He sounded petulant and groggy, and Alan reached under\nhis seat for the thermos he'd had filled at the Greek's before heading\nto Kurt's place. \"Coffee,\" he said, and handed it to Kurt, who groaned\nand swigged and stopped bitching.\n\n\"Why bother is this,\" Alan said. \"We're going to get a lot of publicity\nfor doing this.\" Kurt snorted into the thermos. \"It's going to be a big\ndeal. You know how big a deal this can be. We're going to communicate\nthat to the press, who will communicate it to the public, and then there\nwill be a shitstorm. Radio cops, telco people, whatever -- they're going\nto try to discredit us. I want to know what they're liable to say.\"\n\n\"Christ, you're dragging me out for that? I can tell you what they'll\nsay. They'll drag out the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse: kiddie porn,\nterrorists, pirates, and the mafia. They'll tell us that any tool for\ncommunicating that they can't tap, log, and switch off is\nirresponsible. They'll tell us we're stealing from ISPs. It's what they\nsay every time someone tries this: Philly, New York, London. All around\nthe world same song.\"\n\nAlan nodded. \"That's good background -- thanks. I still want to know\n*how* they say it, what the flaws are in their expression of their\nargument. And I wanted us to run a demo for some people who we could\nnever hope to sway -- that's a good audience for exposing the flaws in\nthe show. This'll be a good prep session.\"\n\n\"So I pulled an all-nighter and busted my nuts to produce a demo for a\nbunch of people we don't care about? Thanks a lot.\"\n\nAlan started to say something equally bitchy back, and then he stopped\nhimself. He knew where this would end up -- a screaming match that would\nleave both of them emotionally overwrought at a time when they needed\ncool heads. But he couldn't think of what to tell Kurt in order to\nplacate him. All his life, he'd been in situations like this: confronted\nby people who had some beef, some grievance, and he'd had no answer for\nit. Usually he could puzzle out the skeleton of their cause, but\nsometimes -- times like this -- he was stumped.\n\nHe picked at the phrase. *I pulled an all-nighter*. Kurt pulled an\nall-nighter because he'd left this to the last minute, not because Alan\nhad surprised him with it. He knew that, of course. Was waiting, then,\nfor Alan to bust him on it. To tell him, *This is your fault, not mine.*\nTo tell him *If this demo fails, it's because you fucked off and left it\nto the last minute.* So he was angry, but not at Alan, he was angry at\nhimself.\n\n*A bunch of people we don't care about,* what was that about? Ah. Kurt\n knew that they didn't take him seriously in the real world. He was too\n dirty, too punk-as-fuck, too much of his identity was wrapped up in\n being alienated and alienating. But he couldn't make his dream come\n true without Alan's help, either, and so Alan was the friendly face on\n their enterprise, and he resented that -- feared that in order to keep\n up his appearance of punk-as-fuckitude, he'd have to go into the\n meeting cursing and sneering and that Alan would bust him on that, too.\n\nAlan frowned at the steering wheel. He was getting better at\nunderstanding people, but that didn't make him necessarily better at\nbeing a person. What should he say here?\n\n\"That was a really heroic effort, Kurt,\" he said, biting his lip. \"I can\ntell you put a lot of work into it.\" He couldn't believe that praise\nthis naked could possibly placate someone of Kurt's heroic cynicism, but\nKurt's features softened and he turned his face away, rolled down the\nwindow, lit a cigarette.\n\n\"I thought I'd never get it done,\" Kurt said. \"I was so sleepy, I felt\nlike I was half-baked. Couldn't concentrate.\"\n\n*You were up all night because you left it to the last minute*, Alan\n thought. But Kurt knew that, was waiting to be reassured about it. \"I\n don't know how you get as much done as you do. Must be really hard.\"\n\n\"It's not so bad,\" Kurt said, dragging on his cigarette and not quite\ndisguising his grin. \"It gets easier every time.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we're going to get this down to a science someday,\" Alan\nsaid. \"Something we can teach anyone to do.\"\n\n\"That would be so cool,\" Kurt said, and put his boots up on the\ndash. \"God, you could pick all the parts you needed out of the trash,\nthrow a little methodology at them, and out would pop this thing that\ndestroyed the phone company.\"\n\n\"This is going to be a fun meeting,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Shit, yeah. They're going to be terrified of us.\"\n\n\"Someday. Maybe it starts today.\"\n\n#\n\nThe Bell boardroom looked more like a retail operation than a back\noffice, decked out in brand-consistent livery, from the fabric-dyed rag\ncarpets to the avant-garde lighting fixtures. They were given espressos\nby the young secretary-barista whose skirt-and-top number was some kind\nof reinterpreted ravewear outfit toned down for a corporate workplace.\n\n\"So this is the new Bell,\" Kurt said, once she had gone. \"Our tax\ndollars at work.\"\n\n\"This is good work,\" Alan said, gesturing at the blown-up artwork of\npan-ethnic models who were extraordinary- but not beautiful-looking on\nthe walls. The Bell redesign had come at the same time as the telco was\nstruggling back from the brink of bankruptcy, and the marketing firm\nthey'd hired to do the work had made its name on the strength of the\ncampaign. \"Makes you feel like using a phone is a really futuristic,\ncutting-edge activity,\" he said.\n\nHis contact at the semiprivatized corporation was a young kid who\nshopped at one of his prot\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9g\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9s' designer furniture store. He was a young\nturk who'd made a name for himself quickly in the company through a\ncouple of ISP acquisitions at fire-sale prices after the dot-bomb, which\nhe'd executed flawlessly, integrating the companies into Bell's network\nwith hardly a hiccup. He'd been very polite and guardedly enthusiastic\nwhen Alan called him, and had invited him down to meet some of his\ncolleagues.\n\nThough Alan had never met him, he recognized him the minute he walked in\nas the person who had to go with the confident voice he'd heard on the\nphone.\n\n\"Lyman,\" he said, standing up and holding out his hand. The guy was\nslightly Asian-looking, tall, with a sharp suit that managed to look\ncasual and expensive at the same time.\n\nHe shook Alan's hand and said, \"Thanks for coming down.\" Alan introduced\nhim to Kurt, and then Lyman introduced them both to his colleagues, a\ngender-parity posse of young, smart-looking people, along with one\ngraybeard (literally -- he had a Unix beard of great rattiness and\ngravitas) who had no fewer than seven devices on his belt, including a\nline tester and a GPS.\n\nOnce they were seated, Alan snuck a look at Kurt, who had narrowed his\neyes and cast his gaze down onto the business cards he'd been\nhanded. Alan hadn't been expecting this -- he'd figured on finding\nhimself facing down a group of career bureaucrats -- and Kurt was\nclearly thrown for a loop, too.\n\n\"Well, Alan, Kurt, it's nice to meet you,\" Lyman said. \"I hear you're\nworking on some exciting stuff.\"\n\n\"We are,\" Alan said. \"We're building a city-wide mesh wireless network\nusing unlicensed spectrum that will provide high-speed, Internet\nconnectivity absolutely gratis.\"\n\n\"That's ambitious,\" Lyman said, without the skepticism that Alan had\nassumed would greet his statement. \"How's it coming?\"\n\n\"Well, we've got a bunch of Kensington Market covered,\" Alan\nsaid. \"Kurt's been improving the hardware design and we've come up with\nsomething cheap and reproducible.\" He opened his tub and handed out the\naccess points, housed in gray high-impact plastic junction boxes.\n\nLyman accepted one solemnly and passed it on to his graybeard, then\npassed the next to an East Indian woman in horn-rim glasses whose\nbitten-down fingernails immediately popped the latch and began lightly\nstroking the hardware inside, tracing the connections. The third landed\nin front of Lyman himself.\n\n\"So, what do they do?\"\n\nAlan nodded at Kurt. Kurt put his hands on the table and took a\nbreath. \"They've got three network interfaces; we can do any combination\nof wired and wireless cards. The OS is loaded on a flash-card; it\nauto-detects any wireless cards and auto-configures them to seek out\nother access points. When it finds a peer, they negotiate a\nclient-server relationship based on current load, and the client then\nassociates with the server. There's a key exchange that we use to make\nsure that rogue APs don't sneak into the mesh, and a self-healing\nroutine we use to switch routes if the connection drops or we start to\nsee too much packet loss.\"\n\nThe graybeard looked up. \"It izz a radio vor talking to Gott!\" he\nsaid. Lyman's posse laughed, and after a second, so did Kurt.\n\nAlan must have looked puzzled, for Kurt elbowed him in the ribs and\nsaid, \"It's from Indiana Jones,\" he said.\n\n\"Ha,\" Alan said. That movie had come out long before he'd come to the\ncity -- he hadn't seen a movie until he was almost 20. As was often the\ncase, the reference to a film made him feel like a Martian.\n\nThe graybeard passed his unit on to the others at the table.\n\n\"Does it work?\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Well, that's pretty cool,\" he said.\n\nKurt blushed. \"I didn't write the firmware,\" he said. \"Just stuck it\ntogether from parts of other peoples' projects.\"\n\n\"So, what's the plan?\" Lyman said. \"How many of these are you going to\nneed?\"\n\n\"Hundreds, eventually,\" Alan said. \"But for starters, we'll be happy if\nwe can get enough to shoot down to 151 Front.\"\n\n\"You're going to try to peer with someone there?\" The East Indian woman\nhad plugged the AP into a riser under the boardroom table and was\nexamining its blinkenlights.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said. \"That's the general idea.\" He was getting a little\nuncomfortable -- these people weren't nearly hostile enough to their\nideas.\n\n\"Well, that's very ambitious,\" Lyman said. His posse all nodded as\nthough he'd paid them a compliment, though Alan wasn't sure. Ambitious\ncould certainly be code for \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"How about a demo?\" the East Indian woman said.\n\n\"Course,\" Kurt said. He dug out his laptop, a battered thing held\ntogether with band stickers and gaffer tape, and plugged in a wireless\ncard. The others started to pass him back his access points but he shook\nhis head. \"Just plug 'em in,\" he said. \"Here or in another room nearby\n-- that'll be cooler.\"\n\nA couple of the younger people at the table picked up two of the APs and\nheaded for the hallway. \"Put one on my desk,\" Lyman told them, \"and the\nother at reception.\"\n\nAlan felt a sudden prickle at the back of his neck, though he didn't\nknow why -- just a random premonition that they were on the brink of\nsomething very bad happening. This wasn't the kind of vision that Brad\nwould experience, that far away look followed by a snap-to into the now,\neyes filled with certitude about the dreadful future. More like a goose\nwalking over his grave, a tickle of badness.\n\nThe East Indian woman passed Kurt a VGA cable that snaked into the\ntable's guts and down into the riser on the floor. She hit a button on a\nremote and an LCD projector mounted in the ceiling began to hum,\nprojecting a rectangle of white light on one wall. Kurt wiggled it into\nthe backside of his computer and spun down the thumbscrews, hit a\nbutton, and then his desktop was up on the wall, ten feet high. His\nwallpaper was a picture of a group of black-clad, kerchiefed protesters\ncharging a police line of batons and gas-grenades. A closer look\nrevealed that the protester running in the lead was probably Kurt.\n\nHe tapped at his touchpad and a window came up, showing relative\nstrength signals for two of the access points. A moment later, the third\ncame online.\n\n\"I've been working with this network visualizer app,\" Kurt said. \"It\ntries to draw logical maps of the network topology, with false coloring\ndenoting packet loss between hops -- that's a pretty good proxy for\ndistance between two APs.\"\n\n\"More like the fade,\" the graybeard said.\n\n\"Fade is a function of distance,\" Kurt said. Alan heard the dismissal in\nhis voice and knew they were getting into a dick-swinging match.\n\n\"Fade is a function of geography and topology,\" the graybeard said\nquietly.\n\nKurt waved his hand. \"Whatever --\nsure. Geography. Topology. Distance. It's a floor wax and a dessert\ntopping.\"\n\n\"I'm not being pedantic,\" the graybeard said.\n\n\"You're not just being pedantic,\" Lyman said gently, watching the screen\non which four animated jaggy boxes were jumbling and dancing as they\nreported on the throughput between the routers and the laptop.\n\n\"Not just pedantic,\" the graybeard said. \"If you have a *lot* of these\nboxes in known locations with known nominal throughput, you can use them\nas a kind of sensor array. When throughput drops between point foo and\npoint bar, it will tell you something about the physical world between\nfoo and bar.\"\n\nKurt looked up from his screen with a thoughtful look. \"Huh?\"\n\n\"Like, whether a tree had lost its leaves in the night. Or whether there\nwere a lot of people standing around in a normally desolate area. Or\nwhether there are lots of devices operating between foo and bar that are\ninterfering with them.\"\n\nKurt nodded slowly. \"The packets we lose could be just as interesting as\nthe packets we don't lose,\" he said.\n\nA light went on in Alan's head. \"We could be like jazz critics,\nlistening to the silences instead of the notes,\" he said. They all\nlooked at him.\n\n\"That's very good,\" Lyman said. \"Like a jazz critic.\" He smiled.\n\nAlan smiled back.\n\n\"What are we seeing, Craig?\" Lyman said.\n\n\"Kurt,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Right, Kurt,\" he said. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"We're seeing the grid here. See how the access points go further up the\nspectrum the more packets they get? I'm associated with that bad boy\nright there.\" He gestured to the box blinking silently in the middle of\nthe board room table. \"And it's connected to one other, which is\nconnected to a third.\"\n\nLyman picked up his phone and dialed a speed-dial number. \"Hey, can you\nunplug the box on my desk?\"\n\nA moment later, one of the boxes on the display winked out. \"Watch\nthis,\" Kurt said, as the remaining two boxes were joined by a\ncoruscating line. \"See that? Self-healing. Minimal packet\nloss. Beautiful.\"\n\n\"That's hot,\" Lyman said. \"That makes me all wet.\"\n\nThey chuckled nervously at his crudity. \"Seriously.\"\n\n\"Here,\" Kurt said, and another window popped up, showing twenty or more\nboxes with marching ant trails between them. \"That's a time-lapse of the\nKensington network. The boxes are running different versions of the\nfirmware, so you can see that in some edge cases, you get a lot more\noscillation between two similar signals. We fixed that in the new\nversion.\"\n\nThe graybeard said, \"How?\"\n\n\"We flip a coin,\" Kurt said, and grinned. \"These guys in Denmark ran\nsome simulations, proved that a random toss-up worked as well as any\nother algorithm, and it's a lot cheaper, computationally.\"\n\n\"So what's going on just to the northeast of center?\"\n\nAlan paid attention to the patch of screen indicated. Three access\npoints were playing musical chairs, dropping signal and reacquiring it,\ndropping it again.\n\nKurt shrugged. \"Bum hardware, I think. We've got volunteers assembling\nthose boxes, from parts.\"\n\n\"Parts?\"\n\nKurt's grin widened. \"Yeah. From the trash, mostly. I dumpster-dive for\n'em.\"\n\nThey grinned back. \"That's very hot,\" Lyman said.\n\n\"We're looking at normalizing the parts for the next revision,\" Alan\nsaid. \"We want to be able to use a single distro that works on all of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Lyman said, but he looked a little disappointed, and so did\nKurt.\n\n\"Okay, it works,\" Lyman said. \"It works?\" he said, nodding the question\nat his posse. They nodded back. \"So what can we do for you?\"\n\nAlan chewed his lip, caught himself at it, stopped. He'd anticipated a\nslugfest, now he was getting strokes.\n\n\"How come you're being so nice to us?\" Kurt said. \"You guys are The\nMan.\" He shrugged at Alan. \"Someone had to say it.\"\n\nLyman smiled. \"Yeah, we're the phone company. Big lumbering dinosaur\nthat is thrashing in the tarpit. The spazz dinosaur that's so\nembarrassed all the other dinosaurs that none of them want to rescue\nus.\"\n\n\"Heh, spazz dinosaur,\" the East Indian woman said, and they all laughed.\n\n\"Heh,\" Kurt said. \"But seriously.\"\n\n\"Seriously,\" Lyman said. \"Seriously. Think a second about the scale of a\ntelco. Of this telco. The thousands of kilometers of wire in the\nground. Switching stations. Skilled linesmen and\ncable-pullers. Coders. Switches. Backhaul. Peering arrangements. We've\ngot it all. Ever get on a highway and hit a flat patch where you can't\nsee anything to the horizon except the road and the telephone poles and\nthe wires? Those are *our wires*. It's a lot of goodness, especially for\na big, evil phone company.\n\n\"So we've got a lot of smart hackers. A lot of cool toys. A gigantic\nbudget. The biggest network any of us could ever hope to manage -- like\na model train set the size of a city.\n\n\"That said, we're hardly nimble. Moving a Bell is like shifting a\nbattleship by tapping it on the nose with a toothpick. It can be done,\nbut you can spend ten years doing it and still not be sure if you've\nmade any progress. From the outside, it's easy to mistake 'slow' for\n'evil.' It's easy to make that mistake from the inside, too.\n\n\"But I don't let it get me down. It's *good* for a Bell to be slow and\nplodding, most of the time. You don't want to go home and discover that\nwe've dispatched the progress-ninjas to upgrade all your phones with\nvideo screens and a hush mode that reads your thoughts. Most of our\ncustomers still can't figure out voice mail. Some of them can't figure\nout touch-tone dialing. So we're slow. Conservative. But we can do lots\nof killer R&D, we can roll out really hot upgrades on the back end, and\nwe can provide this essential service to the world that underpins its\nability to communicate. We're not just cool, we're essential.\n\n\"So you come in and you show us your really swell and interesting\nmeshing wireless data boxes, and I say, 'That is damned cool.' I think\nof ways that it could be part of a Bell's business plan in a couple\ndecades' time.\"\n\n\"A couple decades?\" Kurt squawked. \"Jesus Christ, I expect to have a\nchip in my brain and a jetpack in a couple decades' time.\"\n\n\"Which is why you'd be an idiot to get involved with us,\" Lyman said.\n\n\"Who wants to get involved with you?\" Kurt said.\n\n\"No one,\" Alan said, putting his hands on the table, grateful that the\nconflict had finally hove above the surface. \"That's not what we're here\nfor.\"\n\n\"Why are you here, Alvin?\" Lyman said.\n\n\"We're here because we're going into the moving-data-around trade, in an\nambitious way, and because you folks are the most ambitious\nmoving-data-around tradespeople in town. I thought we'd come by and let\nyou know what we're up to, see if you have any advice for us.\"\n\n\"Advice, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. You've got lots of money and linesmen and switches and users and\nso forth. You probably have some kind of well-developed cosmology of\nconnectivity, with best practices and philosophical ruminations and\ntasty metaphors. And I hear that you, personally, are really good at\nmaking geeks and telcos play together. Since we're going to be a kind of\ntelco\" -- Kurt startled and Alan kicked him under the table -- \"I\nthought you could help us get started right.\"\n\n\"Advice,\" Lyman said, drumming his fingers. He stood up and paced.\n\n\"One: don't bother. This is at least two orders of magnitude harder than\nyou think it is. There aren't enough junk computers in all of Toronto's\nlandfills to blanket the city in free wireless. The range is nothing but\nthree hundred feet, right? Less if there are trees and buildings, and\nthis city is all trees and buildings.\n\n\"Two: don't bother. The liability here is stunning. The gear you're\nbuilding is nice and all, but you're putting it into people's hands and\nyou've got no idea what they're going to do with it. They're going to\nhack in bigger antennae and signal amplifiers. The radio cops will be on\nyour ass day and night.\n\n\"What's more, they're going to open it up to the rest of the world and\nany yahoo who has a need to hide what he's up to is going to use your\nnetwork to commit unspeakable acts -- you're going to be every pirate's\nbest friend and every terrorist's safest haven.\n\n\"Three: don't bother. This isn't going to work. You've got a cute little\nrouting algorithm that runs with three nodes, and you've got a model\nthat may scale up to 300, but by the time you get to 30 thousand, you're\ngoing to be hitting so much latency and dropping so many packets on the\nfloor and incurring so much signaling overhead that it'll be a gigantic\nfailure.\n\n\"You want my advice? Turn this into a piece of enterprise technology: a\ncheap way of rolling out managed solutions in hotels and office towers\nand condos -- building-wide meshes, not city-wide. Those guys will pay\n-- they pay a hundred bucks per punchdown now for wired networking, so\nthey'll gladly cough up a thousand bucks a floor for these boxes, and\nyou'll only need one on every other story. And those people *use*\nnetworks, they're not joe consumer who doesn't have the first clue what\nto do with a network connection.\"\n\nKurt had stiffened up when the rant began, and once he heard the word\n\"consumer,\" he began to positively vibrate. Alan gave him a warning\nnudge with his elbow.\n\n\"You're shitting me, right?\" Kurt said.\n\n\"You asked me for advice --\" Lyman said, mildly.\n\n\"You think we're going to bust our balls to design and deploy all this\nhardware so that business hotels can save money on cable-pullers? Why\nthe hell would we want to do that?\"\n\n\"Because it pays pretty well,\" Lyman said. He was shaking his head a\nlittle, leaning back from the table, and his posse picked up on it,\ngoing slightly restless and fidgety, with a room-wide rustle of papers\nand clicking of pens and laptop latches.\n\nAlan held up his hand. \"Lyman, I'm sorry, we've been unclear. We're not\ndoing this as a money-making venture --\" Kurt snorted. \"It's about\nserving the public interest. We want to give our neighbors access to\ntools and ideas that they wouldn't have had before. There's something\nfundamentally undemocratic about charging money for communications: It\nmeans that the more money you have, the more you get to communicate. So\nwe're trying to fix that, in some small way. We are heartily\nappreciative of your advice, though --\"\n\nLyman held up a hand. \"Sorry, Alan, I don't mean to interrupt, but there\nwas something I wanted to relate to you two, and I've got to go in about\nfive minutes.\" Apparently, the meeting was at an end. \"And I had made\nmyself a note to tell you two about this when I discovered it last\nweek. Can I have the floor?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I took a holiday last week,\" Lyman said. \"Me and my girlfriend. We went\nto Switzerland to see the Alps and to visit her sister, who's doing\nsomething for the UN in Geneva. So her sister, she's into, I don't know,\nsaving children from vampires in Afghanistan or something, and she has\nInternet access at the office, and can't see any reason to drop a\nconnection in at home. So there I was, wandering the streets of Geneva\nat seven in the morning, trying to find a WiFi connection so I can get\nmy email and find out how many ways I can enlarge my penis this week.\n\n\"No problem -- outside every hotel and most of the caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9s, I can find a\nsignal for a network called Swisscom. I log on to the network and I fire\nup a browser and I get a screen asking me for my password. Well, I don't\nhave one, but after poking around, I find out that I can buy a card with\na temporary password on it. So I wait until some of the little smoke\nshops open and start asking them if they sell Swisscom Internet Cards,\nin my terrible, miserable French, and after chuckling at my accent, they\nlook at me and say, 'I have no clue what you're talking about,' shrug,\nand go back to work.\n\n\"Then I get the idea to go and ask at the hotels. The first one, the guy\ntells me that they only sell cards to guests, since they're in short\nsupply. The cards are in short supply! Three hotels later, they allow as\nhow they'll sell me a 30-minute card. Oh, that's fine. Thirty whole\nminutes of connectivity. Whoopee. And how much will that be? Only about\na zillion Swiss pesos. Don't they sell cards of larger denominations? Oh\nsure, two hours, 24 hours, seven days -- and each one costs about double\nthe last, so if you want, you can get a seven day card for about as much\nas you'd spend on a day's worth of connectivity in 30-minute increments\n-- about three hundred dollars Canadian for a week, just FYI.\n\n\"Well, paying 300 bucks for a week's Internet is ghastly, but very\nSwiss, where they charge you if you have more than two bits of cheese at\nbreakfast, and hell, I could afford it. But three hundred bucks for a\nday's worth of 30-minute cards? Fuck that. I was going to have to find a\nseven-day card or bust. So I ask at a couple more hotels and finally\nfind someone who'll explain to me that Swisscom is the Swiss telco, and\nthat they have a retail storefront a couple blocks away where they'd\nsell me all the cards I wanted, in whatever denominations I require.\n\n\"By this time, it's nearly nine a.m. and I'm thinking that my girlfriend\nand her sister are probably up and eating a big old breakfast and\nwondering where the fuck I am, but I've got too much invested in this\nadventure to give up when I'm so close to finding the treasure. And so I\nhied myself off to the Swisscom storefront, which is closed, even though\nthe sign says they open at nine and by now it's nine-oh-five, and so\nmuch for Swiss punctuality. But eventually this sneering kid with last\nyear's faux-hawk comes out and opens the door and then disappears up the\nstairs at the back of the show room to the second floor, where I follow\nhim. I get up to his counter and say, '*Pardonnez moi*,' but he holds up\na hand and points behind me and says, 'Numero!' I make an elaborate\nshrug, but he just points again and says, '*Numero*!' I shrug again and\nhe shakes his head like he's dealing with some kind of unbelievable\nmoron, and then he steps out from behind his counter and stalks over to\na little touchscreen. He takes my hand by the wrist and plants my palm\non the touchscreen and a little ribbon of paper with zero-zero-one\nslides out. I take it and he goes back behind his counter and says,\n'*Numero un*!'\n\n\"I can tell this is not going to work out, but I need to go through the\nmotions. I go to the counter and ask for a seven-day card. He opens his\ncash drawer and paws through a pile of cards, then smiles and shakes his\nhead and says, sorry, all sold out. My girlfriend is probably through\nher second cup of coffee and reading brochures for nature walks in the\nAlps at this point, so I say, fine, give me a one-day card. He takes a\nmoment to snicker at my French, then says, so sorry, sold out those,\ntoo. Two hours? Nope. Half an hour? Oh, those we got.\n\n\"Think about this for a second. I am sitting there with my laptop in\nhand, at six in the morning, on a Swiss street, connected to Swisscom's\nnetwork, a credit card in my other hand, wishing to give them some money\nin exchange for the use of their network, and instead I have to go\nchasing up and down every hotel in Geneva for a card, which is not to be\nfound. So I go to the origin of these cards, the Swisscom store, and\nthey're sold out, too. This is not a T-shirt or a loaf of bread: there's\nno inherent scarcity in two-hour or seven-day cards. The cards are just\na convenient place to print some numbers, and all you need to do to make\nmore numbers is pull them out of thin air. They're just numbers. We have\nas many of them as we could possibly need. There's no sane, rational\nuniverse in which all the 'two-hour' numbers sell out, leaving nothing\nbehind but '30-minute' numbers.\n\n\"So that's pretty bad. It's the kind of story that net-heads tell about\nBell-heads all around the world. It's the kind of thing I've made it my\nbusiness to hunt down and exterminate here wherever I find it. So I just\nwrote off my email for that week and came home and downloaded a hundred\nthousand spams about my cock's insufficient dimensions and went in to\nwork and I told everyone I could find about this, and they all smiled\nnervously and none of them seemed to find it as weird and ridiculous as\nme, and then, that Friday, I went into a meeting about our new\nhigh-speed WiFi service that we're piloting in Montreal and the guy in\ncharge of the program hands out these little packages to everyone in the\nmeeting, a slide deck and some of the marketing collateral and -- a\nlittle prepaid 30-minute access card.\n\n\"That's what we're delivering. Prepaid cards for Internet\naccess. *Complet avec* number shortages and business travelers prowling\nthe bagel joints of Rue St Urbain looking for a shopkeeper whose cash\ndrawer has a few seven-day cards kicking around.\n\n\"And you come in here, and you ask me, you ask the ruling Bell, what\nadvice do we have for your metro-wide free info-hippie wireless\ndumpster-diver anarcho-network? Honestly -- I don't have a fucking\nclue. We don't have a fucking clue. We're a telephone company. We don't\nknow how to give away free communications -- we don't even know how to\ncharge for it.\"\n\n\"That was refreshingly honest,\" Kurt said. \"I wanna shake your hand.\"\n\nHe stood up and Lyman stood up and Lyman's posse stood up and they\nconverged on the doorway in an orgy of handshaking and grinning. The\ngraybeard handed over the access point, and the East Indian woman ran\noff to get the other two, and before they knew it, they were out on the\nstreet.\n\n\"I liked him,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"I could tell,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Remember you said something about an advisory board? How about if we\nask him to join?\"\n\n\"That is a *tremendous* and deeply weird idea, partner. I'll send out\nthe invite when we get home.\"\n\n#\n\nKurt said that the anarchist bookstore would be a slam dunk, but it\nturned out to be the hardest sell of all.\n\n\"I spoke to them last month, they said they were going to run it down in\ntheir weekly general meeting. They love it. It's anarcho-radio. Plus,\nthey all want high-speed connectivity in the store so they can webcast\ntheir poetry slams. Just go on by and introduce yourself, tell 'em I\nsent you.\"\n\nAmbrose nodded and skewered up a hunk of omelet and swirled it in the\nlive yogurt the Greek served, and chewed. \"All right,\" he said, \"I'll do\nit this afternoon. You look exhausted, by the way. Hard night in the\nsalt mines?\"\n\nKurt looked at his watch. \"I got about an hour's worth of diving in. I\nspent the rest of the night breaking up with Monica.\"\n\n\"Monica?\"\n\n\"The girlfriend.\"\n\n\"Already? I thought you two just got together last month.\"\n\nKurt shrugged. \"Longest fucking month of my life. All she wanted to do\nwas go clubbing all night. She hated staying over at my place because of\nthe kids coming by in the morning to work on the access points.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, pal,\" Andy said. He never knew what to do about failed\nromance. He'd had no experience in that department since the seventh\ngrade, after all. \"You'll find someone else soon enough.\"\n\n\"Too soon!\" Kurt said. \"We screamed at each other for five hours before\nI finally got gone. It was probably my fault. I lose my temper too\neasy. I should be more like you.\"\n\n\"You're a good man, Kurt. Don't forget it.\"\n\nKurt ground his fists into his eyes and groaned. \"I'm such a fuck-up,\"\nhe said.\n\nAlan tugged Kurt's hand away from his face. \"Stop that. You're an\nextraordinary person. I've never met anyone who has the gifts you\npossess, and I've met some gifted people. You should be very proud of\nthe work you're doing, and you should be with someone who's equally\nproud of you.\"\n\nKurt visibly inflated. \"Thanks, man.\" They gripped one another's hands\nfor a moment. Kurt swiped at his moist eyes with the sleeve of his\ncolorless grey sweatshirt. \"Okay, it's way past my bedtime,\" he\nsaid. \"You gonna go to the bookstore today?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Thanks for setting them up.\"\n\n\"It was about time I did some of the work, after you got the nut-shop\nand the cheese place and the Salvadoran pupusa place.\"\n\n\"Kurt, I'm just doing the work that you set in motion. It's all you,\nthis project. I'm just your helper. Sleep well.\"\n\nAndy watched him slouch off toward home, reeling a little from sleep\ndeprivation and emotional exhaustion. He forked up the rest of his\nomelet, looked reflexively up at the blinkenlights on the AP over the\nGreek's sign, just above the apostrophe, where he'd nailed it up two\nmonths before. Since then, he'd nailed up five more, each going more\nsmoothly than the last. At this rate, he'd have every main drag in the\nMarket covered by summer. Sooner, if he could offload some of the labor\nonto one of Kurt's eager kids.\n\nHe went back to his porch then, and watched the Market wake up. The\ntraffic was mostly bicycling bankers stopping for a fresh bagel on their\nway down to the business district. The Market was quite restful. It\nshuffled like an old man in carpet slippers, setting up streetside\nproduce tables, twiddling the dials of its many radios looking for\nsomething with a beat. He watched them roll past, the Salvadoran pupusa\nladies, Jamaican Patty Kings, Italian butchers, Vietnamese pho-tenders,\nand any number of thrift-store hotties, crusty-punks, strung-out\nartistes, trustafarians and pretty-boy skaters.\n\nAs he watched them go past, he had an idea that he'd better write his\nstory soon, or maybe never. Maybe never nothing: Maybe this was his last\nseason on earth. Felt like that, apocalyptic. Old debts, come to be\nsettled.\n\nHe shuffled upstairs and turned on the disused computer, which had sat\non his desk for months and was therefore no longer top-of-the-line, no\nlonger nearly so exciting, no longer so fraught with promise. Still, he\nmade himself sit in his seat for two full hours before he allowed\nhimself to get up, shower, dress, and head over to the anarchist\nbookstore, taking a slow route that gave him the chance to eyeball the\nlights on all the APs he'd installed.\n\nThe anarchist bookstore opened lackadaisically at 11 or eleven-thirty or\nsometimes noon, so he'd brought along a nice old John D. MacDonald\npaperback with a gun-toting bikini girl on the cover to read. He liked\nMacDonald's books: You could always tell who the villainesses were\nbecause the narrator made a point of noting that they had fat asses. It\nwas as good a way as any to shorthand the world, he thought.\n\nThe guy who came by to open the store was vaguely familiar to Alfred, a\nKensington stalwart of about forty, whose thrifted slacks and unraveling\nsweater weren't hip so much as they were just plain old down and out. He\nhad a frizzed-out, no-cut haircut, and carried an enormous army-surplus\nbackpack that sagged with beat-up lefty books and bags of organic\nvegetariania.\n\n\"Hi there!\" Arnold said pocketing the book and dusting off his hands.\n\n\"Hey,\" the guy said into his stringy beard, fumbling with a\nkeyring. \"I'll be opening up in a couple minutes, okay? I know I'm\nlate. It's a bad day. okay?\"\n\nArnold held his hands up, palms out. \"Hey, no problem at all! Take as\nmuch time as you need. I'm in no hurry.\"\n\nThe anarchist hustled around inside the shop, turning on lights, firing\nup the cash-register and counting out a float, switching on the coffee\nmachine. Alan waited patiently by the doorway, holding the door open\nwith his toe when the clerk hauled out a rack of discounted paperbacks\nand earning a dirty look for his trouble.\n\n\"Okay, we're open,\" the anarchist said looking Alan in the toes. He\nturned around and banged back into the shop and perched himself behind\nthe counter, opening a close-typed punk newspaper and burying his nose\nin it.\n\nAdam walked in behind him and stood at the counter, politely,\nwaiting. The anarchist looked up from his paper and shook his head\nexasperatedly. \"Yes?\"\n\nAlan extended his hand. \"Hi, I'm Archie, I work with Kurt, over on\nAugusta?\"\n\nThe anarchist stared at his hand, then shook it limply.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said.\n\n\"So, Kurt mentioned that he'd spoken to your collective about putting a\nwireless repeater up over your sign?\"\n\nThe anarchist shook his head. \"We decided not to do that, okay.\" He went\nback to his paper.\n\nAndrew considered him for a moment. \"So, what's your name?\"\n\n\"I don't like to give out my name,\" the anarchist said. \"Call me Waldo,\nall right?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Andy said smiling. \"That's fine by me. So, can I ask why\nyou decided not to do it?\"\n\n\"It doesn't fit with our priorities. We're here to make print materials\nabout the movement available to the public. They can get Internet access\nsomewhere else. Internet access is for people who can afford computers,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Good point,\" Art said. \"That's a good point. I wonder if I could ask\nyou to reconsider, though? I'd love a chance to try to explain why this\nshould be important to you.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Waldo said. \"We're not really interested.\"\n\n\"I think you *would* be interested, if it were properly explained to\nyou.\"\n\nWaldo picked up his paper and pointedly read it, breathing heavily.\n\n\"Thanks for your time,\" Avi said and left.\n\n#\n\n\"That's *bullshit*,\" Kurt said. \"Christ, those people --\"\n\n\"I assumed that there was some kind of politics,\" Austin said, \"and I\ndidn't want to get into the middle of it. I know that if I could get a\nchance to present to the whole group, that I could win them over.\"\n\nKurt shook his head angrily. His shop was better organized now, with six\naccess points ready to go and five stuck to the walls as a test bed for\nnew versions of the software. A couple of geeky Korean kids were seated\nat the communal workbench, eating donuts and wrestling with drivers.\n\n\"It's all politics with them. Everything. You should hear them argue\nabout whether it's cool to feed meat to the store cat! Who was working\nbehind the counter?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't tell me his name. He told me to call him --\"\n\n\"Waldo.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Well, that could be any of about six of them, then. That's what they\ntell the cops. They probably thought you were a narc or a fed or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"It's not total paranoia. They've been busted before -- it's always\nbullshit. I raised bail for a couple of them once.\"\n\nAndrew realized that Kurt thought he was offended at being mistaken for\na cop, but he got that. He was weird -- visibly weird. Out of place\nwherever he was.\n\n\"So they owe me. Let me talk to them some more.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Kurt. I appreciate it.\"\n\n\"Well, you're doing all the heavy lifting these days. It's the least I\ncan do.\"\n\nAlan clapped a hand on his shoulder. \"None of this would exist without\nyou, you know.\" He waved his hand to take in the room, the Korean kids,\nthe whole Market. \"I saw a bunch of people at the Greek's with laptops,\nshowing them around to each other and drinking beers. In the park, with\nPDAs. I see people sitting on their porches, typing in the\ntwilight. Crouched in doorways. Eating a bagel in the morning on a\nbench. People are finding it, and it's thanks to you.\"\n\nKurt smiled a shy smile. \"You're just trying to cheer me up,\" he said.\n\n\"Course I am,\" Andy said. \"You deserve to be full of cheer.\"\n\n#\n\n\"Don't bother,\" Andy said. \"Seriously, it's not worth it. We'll just\nfind somewhere else to locate the repeater. It's not worth all the\nbullshit you're getting.\"\n\n\"Screw that. They told me that they'd take one. They're the only ones\n*I* talked into it. My contribution to the effort. And they're fucking\n*anarchists* -- they've *got* to be into this. It's totally irrational!\"\nHe was almost crying.\n\n\"I don't want you to screw up your friendships, Kurt. They'll come\naround on their own. You're turning yourself inside out over this, and\nit's just not worth it. Come on, it's cool.\" He turned around his laptop\nand showed the picture to Kurt. \"Check it out, people with tails. An\nentire gallery of them!\" There were lots of pictures like that on the\nnet. None of people without belly buttons, though.\n\nKurt took a pull off his beer. \"Disgusting,\" he said and clicked through\nthe gallery.\n\nThe Greek looked over their shoulder. \"It's real?\"\n\n\"It's real, Larry,\" Alan said. \"Freaky, huh?\"\n\n\"That's terrible,\" the Greek said. \"Pah.\" There were five or six other\nnetwork users out on the Greek's, and it was early yet. By five-thirty,\nthere'd be fifty of them. Some of them brought their own power strips so\nthat they could share juice with their coreligionists.\n\n\"You really want me to give up?\" Kurt asked, once the Greek had given\nhim a new beer and a scowling look over the litter of picked-at beer\nlabel on the table before him.\n\n\"I really think you should,\" Alan said. \"It's a poor use of time.\"\n\nKurt looked ready to cry again. Adam had no idea what to say.\n\n\"Okay,\" Kurt said. \"Fine.\" He finished his beer in silence and slunk\naway.\n\n#\n\nBut it wasn't fine, and Kurt wouldn't give it up. He kept on beating his\nhead against the blank wall, and every time Alan saw him, he was grimmer\nthan the last.\n\n\"Let it *go*,\" Adam said. \"I've done a deal with the vacuum-cleaner\nrepair guy across the street.\" A weird-but-sweet old Polish Holocaust\nsurvivor who'd listened attentively to Andy's pitch before announcing\nthat he'd been watching all the hardware go up around the Market and had\nsimply been waiting to be included in the club. \"That'll cover that\ncorner just fine.\"\n\n\"I'm going to throw a party,\" Kurt said. \"Here, in the shop. No, I'll\nrent out one of the warehouses on Oxford. I'll invite them, the kids,\neveryone who's let us put up an access point, a big mill-and-swill. Buy\na couple kegs. No one can resist free beer.\"\n\nAlan had started off frustrated and angry with Kurt, but this drew him\nup and turned him around. \"That is a *fine* idea,\" he said. \"We'll\ninvite Lyman.\"\n\n#\n\nLyman had taken to showing up on Alan's stoop in the morning sometimes,\non his way to work, for a cup of coffee. He'd taken to showing up at\nKurt's shop in the afternoon, sometimes, on his way home from work, to\nmarvel at the kids' industry. His graybeard had written some code that\nanalyzed packet loss and tried to make guesses about the crowd density\nin different parts of the Market, and Lyman took a proprietary interest\nin it, standing out by Bikes on Wheels or the Portuguese furniture store\nand watching the data on his PDA, comparing it with the actual crowds on\nthe street.\n\nHe'd only hesitated for a second when Andrew asked him to be the\ninaugural advisor on ParasiteNet's board, and once he'd said yes, it\nbecame clear to everyone that he was endlessly fascinated by their\nlittle adhocracy and its experimental telco potential.\n\n\"This party sounds like a great idea,\" he said. He was buying the\ndrinks, because he was the one with five-hundred-dollar glasses and a\nfull-suspension racing bike. \"Lookit that,\" he said.\n\nFrom the Greek's front window, they could see Oxford Street and a little\nof Augusta, and Lyman loved using his PDA and his density analysis\nsoftware while he sat, looking from his colored map to the crowd\nscene. \"Lookit the truck as it goes down Oxford and turns up\nAugusta. That signature is so distinctive, I could spot it in my\nsleep. I need to figure out how to sell this to someone -- maybe the\ncops or something.\" He tipped Andy a wink.\n\nKurt opened and shut his mouth a few times, and Lyman slapped his palm\ndown on the table. \"You look like you're going to bust something,\" he\nsaid. \"Don't worry. I kid. Damn, you've got you some big, easy-to-push\nbuttons.\"\n\nKurt made a face. \"You wanted to sell our stuff to luxury hotels. You\ntried to get us to present at the *SkyDome*. You're capable of\nanything.\"\n\n\"The SkyDome would be a great venue for this stuff,\" Lyman said settling\ninto one of his favorite variations of bait-the-anarchist.\n\n\"The SkyDome was built with tax-dollars that should have been spent on\naffordable housing, then was turned over to rich pals of the premier for\na song, who then ran it into the ground, got bailed out by the province,\nand then it got turned over to different rich pals. You can just shut up\nabout the goddamned SkyDome. You'd have to break both of my legs and\n*carry me* to get me to set foot in there.\"\n\n\"About the party,\" Adam said. \"About the party.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" Lyman said. \"Kurt, behave.\"\n\nKurt belched loudly, provoking a scowl from the Greek.\n\n#\n\nThe Waldos all showed up in a bunch, with plastic brown liter bottles\nfilled with murky homemade beer and a giant bag of skunk-weed. The party\nhad only been on for a couple hours, but it had already balkanized into\ninward-facing groups: merchants, kids, hackers. Kurt kept turning the\nmusic way up (\"If they're not going to talk with one another, they might\nas well dance.\" \"Kurt, those people are old. Old people don't dance to\nmusic like this.\" \"Shut up, Lyman.\" \"Make me.\"), and Andy kept turning\nit down.\n\nThe bookstore people drifted in, then stopped and moved vaguely toward\nthe middle of the floor, there to found their own breakaway\nconversational republic. Lyman startled. \"Sara?\" he said and one of the\nanarchists looked up sharply.\n\n\"Lyman?\" She had two short ponytails and a round face that made her look\nteenage young, but on closer inspection she was more Lyman's age,\nmid-thirties. She laughed and crossed the gap to their little republic\nand threw her arms around Lyman's neck. \"Crispy Christ, what are *you*\ndoing here?\"\n\n\"I work with these guys!\" He turned to Arnold and Kurt. \"This is my\ncousin Sara,\" he said. \"These are Albert and Kurt. I'm helping them\nout.\"\n\n\"Hi, Sara,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Hey, Kurt,\" she said looking away. It was clear even to Alan that they\nknew each other already. The other bookstore people were looking on with\nsuspicion, drinking their beer out of refillable coffee-store thermos\ncups.\n\n\"It's great to meet you!\" Alan said taking her hand in both of his and\nshaking it hard. \"I'm really glad you folks came down.\"\n\nShe looked askance at him, but Lyman interposed himself. \"Now, Sara,\nthese guys really, really wanted to talk something over with you all,\nbut they've been having a hard time getting a hearing.\"\n\nKurt and Alan traded uneasy glances. They'd carefully planned out a\nsubtle easeway into this conversation, but Lyman was running with it.\n\n\"You didn't know that I was involved, huh?\"\n\n\"Surprised the hell outta me,\" Lyman said. \"Will you hear them out?\"\n\nShe looked back at her collective. \"What the hell. Yeah, I'll talk 'em\ninto it.\"\n\n#\n\n\"It starts with the sinking of the *Titanic*,\" Kurt said. They'd\narranged their mismatched chairs in a circle in the cramped back room of\nthe bookstore and were drinking and eating organic crumbly things with\nthe taste and consistency of mud-brick. Sara told Kurt that they'd have\nten minutes, and Alan had told him that he could take it all. Alan'd\nspent the day reading on the net, remembering the arguments that had\nswayed the most people, talking it over. He was determined that Kurt\nwould win this fight.\n\n\"There's this ship going down, and it's signaling S-O-S, S-O-S, but the\nmessage didn't get out, because the shipping lanes were full of other\nships with other radios, radios that clobbered the *Titanic*'s\nsignal. That's because there were no rules for radio back then, so\nanyone could light up any transmitter and send out any signal at any\nfrequency. Imagine a room where everyone shouted at the top of their\nlungs, nonstop, while setting off air horns.\n\n\"After that, they decided that fed regulators would divide up the radio\nspectrum into bands, and give those bands to exclusive licensees who'd\nknow that their radio waves would reach their destination without being\nclobbered, because any clobberers would get shut down by the cops.\n\n\"But today, we've got a better way: We can make radios that are capable\nof intelligently cooperating with each other. We can make radios that\nuse databases or just finely tuned listeners to determine what bands\naren't in use, at any given moment, in any place. They can talk between\nthe gaps in other signals. They can relay messages for other\nradios. They can even try to detect the presence of dumb radio devices,\nlike TVs and FM tuners, and grab the signal they're meant to be\nreceiving off of the Internet and pass it on, so that the dumb device\ndoesn't even realize that the world has moved on.\n\n\"Now, the original radio rules were supposed to protect free expression\nbecause if everyone was allowed to speak at once, no one would be\nheard. That may have been true, but it was a pretty poor system as it\nwent: Mostly, the people who got radio licenses were cops, spooks, and\nmedia barons. There aren't a lot of average people using the airwaves to\ncommunicate for free with one another. Not a lot of free speech.\n\n\"But now we have all this new technology where computers direct the\noperation of flexible radios, radios whose characteristics are\ndetermined by software, and it's looking like the scarcity of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum has been pretty grossly overstated. It's hard\nto prove, because now we've got a world where lighting up a bunch of\nsmart, agile radios is a crime against the 'legit' license-holders.\n\n\"But Parliament's not going to throw the airwaves open because no\nelected politician can be responsible for screwing up the voters'\ntelevisions, because that's the surest-fire way to not get\nreelected. Which means that when you say, 'Hey, our freedom of speech is\nbeing clobbered by bad laws,' the other side can say, 'Go study some\nphysics, hippie, or produce a working network, or shut up.'\n\n\"The radios we're installing now are about one millionth as smart as\nthey could be, and they use one millionth as much spectrum as they could\nwithout stepping on anyone else's signal, but they're legal, and they're\nletting more people communicate than ever. There are people all over the\nworld doing this, and whenever the policy wonks go to the radio cops to\nask for more radio spectrum to do this stuff with, they parade people\nlike us in front of them. We're like the Pinocchio's nose on the face of\nthe radio cops: They say that only their big business buddies can be\ntrusted with the people's airwaves, and we show them up for giant\nliars.\"\n\nHe fell silent and looked at them. Adam held his breath.\n\nSara nodded and broke the silence. \"You know, that sounds pretty cool,\nactually.\"\n\n#\n\nKurt insisted on putting up that access point, while Alan and Lyman\nsteadied the ladder. Sara came out and joked with Lyman, and Alan got\ndistracted watching them, trying to understand this notion of \"cousins.\"\nThey had an easy rapport, despite all their differences, and spoke in a\nshorthand of family weddings long past and crotchety relatives long\ndead.\n\nSo none of them were watching when Kurt overbalanced and dropped the\nMakita, making a wild grab for it, foot slipping off the rung, and\ntoppled backward. It was only Kurt's wild bark of panic that got Adam to\ninstinctively move, to hold out his arms and look up, and he caught Kurt\nunder the armpits and gentled him to the ground, taking the weight of\nKurt's fall in a bone-jarring crush to his rib cage.\n\n\"You okay?\" Alan said once he'd gotten his breath back.\n\n\"Oof,\" Kurt said. \"Yeah.\"\n\nThey were cuddled together on the sidewalk, Kurt atop him, and Lyman and\nSara bent to help them apart. \"Nice catch,\" Lyman said. Kurt was helped\nto his feet, and he declared that he'd sprained his ankle and nothing\nworse, and they helped him back to his shop, where a couple of his kids\ndoted over him, getting him an ice pack and a pillow and his laptop and\none of the many dumpster-dived discmen from around the shop and some of\nthe CDs of old punk bands that he favored.\n\nThere he perched, growly as a wounded bear, master of his kingdom, for\nthe next two weeks, playing online and going twitchy over the missed\ndumpsters going to the landfill every night without his expert picking\nover. Alan visited him every day and listened raptly while Kurt gave him\nthe stats for the day's network usage, and Kurt beamed proud the whole\nwhile.\n\n#\n\nOne morning, Alan threw a clatter of toonies down on the Greek's counter\nand walked around the Market, smelling the last night's staggering\npissers and the morning's blossoms.\n\nHere were his neighbors, multicolored heads at the windows of their\nsagging house adjoining his, Link and Natalie in the adjacent windows\nfarthest from his front door, Mimi's face suspicious at her window, and\nwas that Krishna behind her, watching over her shoulder, hand between\nher wings, fingers tracing the scars depending from the muscles there?\n\nHe waved at them. The reluctant winter made every day feel like the day\nbefore a holiday weekend. The bankers and the retail slaves coming into\nand out of the Market had a festive air.\n\nHe waved at the neighbors, and Link waved back, and then so did Natalie,\nand he hefted his sack of coffees from the Greek's suggestively, and\nMimi shut her curtains with a snap, but Natalie and Link smiled, and a\nmoment later they were sitting in twig chairs on his porch in their\njammies, watching the world go past as the sun began to boil the air and\nthe coffee tasted as good as it smelled.\n\n\"Beautiful day,\" Natalie said rubbing the duckling fuzz on her scalp and\nclosing her eyes.\n\n\"Found any work yet?\" Alan said remembering his promise to put her in\ntouch with one of his fashionista prot\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9g\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9s.\n\nShe made a face. \"In a video store. Bo-ring.\"\n\nLink made a rude noise. \"You are *so* spoiled. Not just any video store,\nshe's working at Martian Signal on Queen Street.\"\n\nAlan knew it, a great shop with a huge selection of cult movies and a\nbrisk trade in zines, transgressive literature, action figures and\nT-shirts.\n\n\"It must be great there,\" he said.\n\nShe smiled and looked away. \"It's okay.\" She bit her lip. \"I don't think\nI like working retail,\" she said.\n\n\"Ah, retail!\" he said. \"Retail would be fantastic if it wasn't for the\nfucking customers.\"\n\nShe giggled.\n\n\"Don't let them get to you,\" he said. \"Get to be really smart about the\nstock, so that there's always something you know more about than they\ndo, and when that isn't true, get them to *teach you* more so you'll be\nin control the next time.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"And have fun with the computer when it's slow,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A store like that, it's got the home phone number of about seventy\npercent of the people in Toronto you'd want to ever hang out with. Most\nof your school friends, even the ones you've lost track of. All the\nthings they've rented. All their old addresses -- you can figure out\nwho's living together, who gave their apartment to whom, all of that\nstuff. That kind of database is way more fun than you realize. You can\nget lost in it for months.\"\n\nShe was nodding slowly. \"I can see that,\" she said. She upended her\ncoffee and set it down. \"Listen, Arbus --\" she began, then bit her lip\nagain. She looked at Link, who tugged at his fading pink shock of hair.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" he said. \"We get emotionally overwrought about friends\nand family. I have as much to apologize for as... Well, I owe you an\napology.\" They stared at the park across the street, at the damaged\nwading pool where Edward had vanished.\n\n\"So, sorries all 'round and kisses and hugs, and now we're all friends\nagain, huh?\" Link said. Natalie made a rude noise and ruffled his hair,\nthen wiped her hand off on his shirt.\n\nAlan, though, solemnly shook each of their hands in turn, and thanked\nthem. When he was done, he felt as though a weight had been lifted from\nhim. Next door, Mimi's window slammed shut.\n\n\"What is it you're doing around here, Akin?\" Link said. \"I keep seeing\nyou running around with ladders and tool belts. I thought you were a\nwriter. Are you soundproofing the whole Market?\"\n\n\"I never told you?\" Alan said. He'd been explaining wireless networking\nto anyone who could sit still and had been beginning to believe that\nhe'd run it down for every denizen of Kensington, but he'd forgotten to\nclue in his own neighbors!\n\n\"Right,\" he said. \"Are you seated comfortably? Then I shall begin. When\nwe connect computers together, we call it a network. There's a *big*\nnetwork of millions of computers, called the Internet.\"\n\n\"Even *I* know this,\" Natalie said.\n\n\"Shush,\" Alan said. \"I'll start at the beginning, where I started a year\nago, and work my way forward. It's weird, it's big and it's cool.\" And\nhe told them the story, the things he'd learned from Kurt, the arguments\nhe'd honed on the shopkeepers, the things Lyman had told him.\n\n\"So that's the holy mission,\" he said at last. \"You give everyone a\nvoice and a chance to speak on a level playing field with the rich and\npowerful, and you make democracy, which is good.\"\n\nHe looked at Link and Natalie, who were looking to one another rather\nintensely, communicating in some silent idiom of sibling body-language.\n\n\"Plate-o-shrimp,\" Natalie said.\n\n\"Funny coincidence,\" Link said.\n\n\"We were just talking about this yesterday.\"\n\n\"Spectrum?\" Alan quirked his eyebrows.\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" Natalie said. \"About making a difference. About holy\nmissions. Wondering if there were any left.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" Link said, \"riding a bike or renting out videos are honest\nways to make a living and all, and they keep us in beer and rent money,\nbut they're not --\"\n\n\"-- *important*.\" Natalie said.\n\n\"Ah,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Ah?\"\n\n\"Well, that's the thing we all want, right? Making a difference.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Which is why you went into fashion,\" Link said giving her skinny\nshoulder a playful shove.\n\nShe shoved him back. \"And why *you* went into electrical engineering!\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Alan said. \"It's not necessarily about what career you\npick. It's about how you do what you do. Natalie, you told me you used\nto shop at Tropic\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1l.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"You liked it, you used to shop there, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"And it inspired you to go into fashion design. It also provided\nemployment for a couple dozen people over the years. I sometimes got to\nhelp out little alternative girls from North Toronto buy vintage prom\ndresses at the end of the year, and I helped Motown revival bands put\ntogether matching outfits of red blazers and wide trousers. Four or five\nlittle shops opened up nearby selling the same kind of thing, imitating\nme -- that whole little strip down there started with Tropic\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1l.\"\n\nNatalie nodded. \"Okay, I knew that, I guess. But it's not the same as\n*really* making a difference, is it?\"\n\nLink flicked his butt to the curb. \"You're changing people's lives for\nthe better either way, right?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Alan said.\n\nThen Link grinned. \"But there's something pretty, oh, I dunno, *ballsy*,\nabout this wireless thing, yeah? It's not the same.\"\n\n\"Not the same,\" Alan said grinning. \"Better.\"\n\n\"How can we help?\"\n\n#\n\nKurt had an assembly line cranking out his access points now. Half a\ndozen street kids worked in the front of his place, in a cleared-out\nspace with a makeshift workbench made from bowed plywood and scratched\nIKEA table-legs. It made Alan feel better to watch them making sense of\nit all, made him feel a little like he felt when he was working on The\nInventory. The kids worked from noon, when Kurt got back from breakfast,\nuntil 9 or 10, when he went out to dive.\n\nThe kids were smart, but screwed up: half by teenaged hormones and half\nby bad parents or bad drugs or just bad brain chemistry. Alan understood\ntheir type, trying to carve some atom of individual identity away from\nfamily and background, putting pins through their bodies and affecting\nunconvincing tough mannerisms. They were often bright -- the used\nbookstore had been full of their type, buying good, beat-up books off\nthe sale rack for 50 cents, trading them back for 20 cents' credit the\nnext day, and buying more.\n\nNatalie and Link were in that morning, along with some newcomers,\nMontreal street punks trying their hand at something other than squeegee\nbumming. The punks and his neighbors gave each other uneasy looks, but\nAlan had deliberately put the sugar for the coffee at the punks' end of\nthe table and the cream in front of Natalie and the stirs by the\nbathroom door with the baklava and the napkins, so a rudimentary social\nintercourse was begun.\n\nFirst, one of the punks (who had a rusty \"NO FUTURE\" pin that Alan\nthought would probably go for real coin on the collectors' market) asked\nNatalie to pass her the cream. Then Link and another punk (foppy silly\nblack hair and a cut-down private school blazer with the short sleeves\npinned on with rows of safety pins) met over the baklava, and the punk\noffered Link a napkin. Another punk spilled her coffee on her lap,\nscreeching horrendous Quebecois blasphemies as curses, and that cracked\neveryone up, and Arnold, watching from near the blanket that fenced off\nKurt's monkish sleeping area, figured that they would get along.\n\n\"Kurt,\" he said pulling aside the blanket, handing a double-double\ncoffee over to Kurt as he sat up and rubbed his eyes. He was wearing a\nwhite T-shirt that was the grimy grey of everything in his domain, and\nbaggy jockeys. He gathered his blankets around him and sipped\nreverently.\n\nKurt cocked his head and listened to the soft discussions going on on\nthe other side of the blanket. \"Christ, they're at it already?\"\n\n\"I think your volunteers showed up a couple hours ago -- or maybe they\nwere up all night.\"\n\nKurt groaned theatrically. \"I'm running a halfway house for geeky street\nkids.\"\n\n\"All for the cause,\" Alan said. \"So, what's on the plate for today?\"\n\n\"You know the church kittycorner from your place?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Alan said cautiously.\n\n\"Its spire is just about the highest point in the Market. An\nomnidirectional up there...\"\n\n\"The church?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"What about the new condos at the top of Baldwin? They're tall.\"\n\n\"They are. But they're up on the northern edge. From the bell-tower of\nthat church, I bet you could shoot half the houses on the west side of\nOxford Street, along with the backs of all the shops on Augusta.\"\n\n\"How are we going to get the church to go along with it. Christ, what\nare they, Ukrainian Orthodox?\"\n\n\"Greek Orthodox,\" Kurt said. \"Yeah, they're pretty conservative.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So, I need a smooth-talking, upstanding cit to go and put the case to\nthe pastor. Priest. Bishop. Whatever.\"\n\n\"Groan,\" Alex said.\n\n\"Oh, come on, you're good at it.\"\n\n\"If I get time,\" he said. He looked into his coffee for a moment. \"I'm\ngoing to go home,\" he said.\n\n\"Home?\"\n\n\"To the mountain,\" he said. \"Home,\" he said. \"To my father,\" he said.\n\n\"Whoa,\" Kurt said. \"Alone?\"\n\nAlan sat on the floor and leaned back against a milk crate full of\nlow-capacity hard drives. \"I have to,\" he said. \"I can't stop thinking\nof...\" He was horrified to discover that he was on the verge of\ntears. It had been three weeks since Davey had vanished into the night,\nand he'd dreamt of Eugene-Fabio-Greg every night since, terrible dreams,\nin which he'd dug like a dog to uncover their hands, their arms, their\nlegs, but never their heads. He swallowed hard.\n\nHe and Kurt hadn't spoken of that night since.\n\n\"I sometimes wonder if it really happened,\" Kurt said.\n\nAlan nodded. \"It's hard to believe. Even for me.\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" Kurt said. \"I won't ever not believe it. I think that's\nprobably important to you.\"\n\nAlan felt a sob well up in his chest and swallowed it down\nagain. \"Thanks,\" he managed to say.\n\n\"When are you leaving?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning. I'm going to rent a car and drive up,\" he said.\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" he said. He was feeling morose now. \"A couple days. A week,\nmaybe. No longer.\"\n\n\"Well, don't sweat the Bishop. He can wait. Come and get a beer with me\ntonight before I go out?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"That sounds good. On a patio on Kensington. We can\npeople-watch.\"\n\n#\n\nHow Alan and his brothers killed Davey: very deliberately.\n\nAlan spent the rest of the winter in the cave, and Davey spent the\nspring in the golem's cave, and through that spring, neither of them\nwent down to the school, so that the younger brothers had to escort\nthemselves to class. When the thaws came and icy meltoff carved\ntemporary streams in the mountainside, they stopped going to school, too\n-- instead, they played on the mountainside, making dams and canals and\nlocks with rocks and imagination.\n\nTheir father was livid. The mountain rumbled as it warmed unevenly, as\nthe sheets of ice slid off its slopes and skittered down toward the\nhighway. The sons of the mountain reveled in their dark ignorance, their\nseparation from the school and from the nonsensical and nonmagical\nsociety of the town. They snared small animals and ate them raw, and\ndidn't wash their clothes, and grew fierce and guttural through the slow\nspring.\n\nAlan kept silent through those months, becoming almost nocturnal,\nrefusing to talk to any brother who dared to talk to him. When\nEd-Fred-George brought home a note from the vice principal asking when\nhe thought he'd be coming back to school, Alan shoved it into his mouth\nand chewed and chewed and chewed, until the paper was reduced to gruel,\nthen he spat it by the matted pile of his bedding.\n\nThe mountain grumbled and he didn't care. The golems came to parley, and\nhe turned his back to them. The stalactites crashed to the cave's floor\nuntil it was carpeted in ankle-deep chips of stone, and he waded through\nthem.\n\nHe waited and bided. He waited for Davey to try to come home.\n\n#\n\n\"What have we here?\" Alan said, as he wandered into Kurt's shop, which\nhad devolved into joyous bedlam. The shelves had been pushed up against\nthe wall, clearing a large open space that was lined with long trestle\ntables. Crusty-punks, goth kids, hippie kids, geeks with vintage\nvideo-game shirts, and even a couple of older, hard-done-by street\npeople crowded around the tables, performing a conglomeration of arcane\ntasks. The air hummed with conversation and coffee smells, the latter\nemanating from a catering-sized urn in the corner.\n\nHe was roundly ignored -- and before he could speak again, one of the\nPCs on the floor started booming out fuzzy, grungy rockabilly music that\nmade him think of Elvis cassettes that had been submerged in salt\nwater. Half of the assembled mass started bobbing their heads and\nsinging along while the other half rolled their eyes and groaned.\n\nKurt came out of the back and hunkered down with the PC, turning down\nthe volume a little. \"Howdy!\" he said, spreading his arms and taking in\nthe whole of his dominion.\n\n\"Howdy yourself,\" Alan said. \"What do we have here?\"\n\n\"We have a glut of volunteers,\" Kurt said, watching as an old rummy\ncarefully shot a picture of a flat-panel LCD that was minus its\nhousing. \"I can't figure out if those laptop screens are worth\nanything,\" he said, cocking his head. \"But they've been taking up space\nfor far too long. Time we moved them.\"\n\nAlan looked around and realized that the workers he'd taken to be at\nwork building access points were, in the main, shooting digital pictures\nof junk from Kurt's diving runs and researching them for eBay\nlistings. It made him feel good -- great, even. It was like watching an\nInventory being assembled from out of chaos.\n\n\"Where'd they all come from?\"\n\nKurt shrugged. \"I dunno. I guess we hit critical mass. You recruit a few\npeople, they recruit a few people. It's a good way to make a couple\nbucks, you get to play with boss crap, you get paid in cash, and you\nhave colorful co-workers.\" He shrugged again. \"I guess they came from\nwherever the trash came from. The city provides.\"\n\nThe homeless guy they were standing near squinted up at them. \"If either\nof you says something like, *Ah, these people were discarded by society,\nbut just as with the junk we rescue from landfills, we have seen the\nworth of these poor folks and rescued them from the scrapheap of\nsociety,* I'm gonna puke.\"\n\n\"The thought never crossed my mind,\" Alan said solemnly.\n\n\"Keep it up, Wes,\" Kurt said, patting the man on the shoulder. \"See you\nat the Greek's tonight?\"\n\n\"Every night, so long as he keeps selling the cheapest beer in the\nMarket,\" Wes said, winking at Alan.\n\n\"It's cash in the door,\" Kurt said. \"Buying components is a lot more\nefficient than trying to find just the right parts.\" He gave Alan a\nmildly reproachful look. Ever since they'd gone to strictly controlled\ndesigns, Kurt had been heartbroken by the amount of really nice crap\nthat never made its way into an access point.\n\n\"This is pretty amazing,\" Alan said. \"You're splitting the money with\nthem?\"\n\n\"The profit -- anything leftover after buying packaging and paying\npostage.\" He walked down the line, greeting people by name, shaking\nhands, marveling at the gewgaws and gimcracks that he, after all, had\nfound in some nighttime dumpster and brought back to be recycled. \"God,\nI love this. It's like Napster for dumpsters.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" Alan asked, pouring himself a coffee and adding some UHT\ncream from a giant, slightly dented box of little creamers.\n\n\"Most of the music ever recorded isn't for sale at any price. Like 80\npercent of it. And the labels, they've made copyright so strong, no one\ncan figure out who all that music belongs to -- not even them! Costs a\nfortune to clear a song. Pal of mine once did a CD of Christmas music\nremixes, and he tried to figure out who owned the rights to all the\nsongs he wanted to use. He just gave up after a year -- and he had only\ncleared one song!\n\n\"So along comes Napster. It finds the only possible way of getting all\nthat music back into our hands. It gives millions and millions of people\nan incentive to rip their old CDs -- hell, their old vinyl and tapes,\ntoo! -- and put them online. No label could have afforded to do that,\nbut the people just did it for free. It was like a barn-raising: a\nlibrary raising!\"\n\nAlan nodded. \"So what's your point -- that companies' dumpsters are\nbeing napstered by people like you?\" A napsterized Inventory. Alan felt\nthe *rightness* of it.\n\nKurt picked a fragile LCD out of a box of dozens of them and smashed it\non the side of the table. \"Exactly!\" he said. \"This is garbage -- it's\nlike the deleted music that you can't buy today, except at the bottom of\nbins at Goodwill or at yard sales. Tons of it has accumulated in\nlandfills. No one could afford to pay enough people to go around and\nrescue it all and figure out the copyrights for it and turn it into\ndigital files and upload it to the net -- but if you give people an\nincentive to tackle a little piece of the problem and a way for my work\nto help you...\" He went to a shelf and picked up a finished AP and\npopped its latches and swung it open.\n\n\"Look at that -- I didn't get its guts out of a dumpster, but someone\nelse did, like as not. I sold the parts I found in my dumpster for money\nthat I exchanged for parts that someone else found in *her* dumpster --\"\n\n\"Her?\"\n\n\"Trying not to be sexist,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Are there female dumpster divers?\"\n\n\"Got me,\" Kurt said. \"In ten years of this, I've only run into other\ndivers twice or three times. Remind me to tell you about the cop\nlater. Anyway. We spread out the effort of rescuing this stuff from the\nlandfill, and then we put our findings online, and we move it to where\nit needs to be. So it's not cost effective for some big corporation to\nfigure out how to use or sell these -- so what? It's not cost-effective\nfor some big dumb record label to figure out how to keep music by any of\nmy favorite bands in print, either. We'll figure it out. We're spookily\ngood at it.\"\n\n\"Spookily?\"\n\n\"Trying to be more poetic.\" He grinned and twisted the fuzzy split ends\nof his newly blue mohawk around his fingers. \"Got a new girlfriend, she\nsays there's not enough poetry in my views on garbage.\"\n\n#\n\nThey found one of Davey's old nests in March, on a day when you could\nalmost believe that the spring would really come and the winter would go\nand the days would lengthen out to more than a few hours of sour\ngreyness huddled around noon. The reference design for the access point\nhad gone through four more iterations, and if you knew where to look in\nthe Market's second-story apartments, rooftops, and lampposts, you could\ntrace the evolution of the design from the clunky PC-shaped boxen in\nAlan's attic on Wales Avenue to the environment-hardened milspec surplus\nboxes that Kurt had rigged from old circuit boxes he'd found in Bell\nCanada's Willowdale switching station dumpster.\n\nAlan steadied the ladder while Kurt tightened the wing nuts on the\nantenna mounting atop the synagogue's roof. It had taken three meetings\nwith the old rabbi before Alan hit on the idea of going to the temple's\nyouth caucus and getting *them* to explain it to the old cleric. The\nsynagogue was one of the oldest buildings in the Market, a\nbrick-and-stone beauty from 1930.\n\nThey'd worried about the fight they'd have over drilling through the\nroof to punch down a wire, but they needn't have: The wood up there was\nsoft as cottage cheese, and showed gaps wide enough to slip the power\ncable down. Now Kurt slathered Loctite over the nuts and washers and\nslipped dangerously down the ladder, toe-tips flying over the rungs.\n\nAlan laughed as he touched down, thinking that Kurt's heart was aburst\nwith the feeling of having finished, at last, at last. But then he\ncaught sight of Kurt's face, ashen, wide-eyed.\n\n\"I saw something,\" he said, talking out of the sides of his mouth. His\nhands were shaking.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Footprints,\" he said. \"There's a lot of leaves that have rotted down to\nmud up there, and there were a pair of little footprints in the\nmud. Like a toddler's footprints, maybe. Except there were two toes\nmissing from one foot. They were stamped down all around this spot where\nI could see there had been a lot of pigeon nests, but there were no\npigeons there, only a couple of beaks and legs -- so dried up that I\ncouldn't figure out what they were at first.\n\n\"But I recognized the footprints. The missing toes, they left prints\nbehind like unbent paperclips.\"\n\nAlan moved, as in a dream, to the ladder and began to climb it.\n\n\"Be careful, it's all rotten up there,\" Kurt called. Alan nodded.\n\n\"Sure, thank you,\" he said, hearing himself say it as though from very\nfar away.\n\nThe rooftop was littered with broken glass and scummy puddles of\nmeltwater and little pebbles and a slurry of decomposing leaves, and\nthere, yes, there were the footprints, just as advertised. He patted the\nantenna box absently, feeling its solidity, and he sat down cross-legged\nbefore the footprints and the beaks and the legs. There were no tooth\nmarks on the birds. They hadn't been eaten, they'd been torn apart, like\na label from a beer bottle absently shredded in the sunset. He pictured\nDavey sitting here on the synagogue's roof, listening to the evening\nprayers, and the calls and music that floated over the Market, watching\nthe grey winter nights come on and slip away, a pigeon in his hand,\nwrithing.\n\nHe wondered if he was catching Bradley's precognition, and if that meant\nthat Bradley was dead now.\n\n#\n\nBradley was born with the future in his eyes. He emerged from the belly\nof their mother with bright brown eyes that did not roll aimlessly in\nthe manner of babies, but rather sought out the corners of the cave\nwhere interesting things were happening, where movement was about to\noccur, where life was being lived. Before he developed the muscle\nstrength and coordination necessary to crawl, he mimed crawling, seeing\nhow it was that he would someday move.\n\nHe was the easiest of all the babies to care for, easier even than\nCarlo, who had no needs other than water and soil and cooing\nreassurance. Toilet training: As soon as he understood what was expected\nof him -- they used the downstream-most bend of one of the underground\nrivers -- Benny could be relied upon to begin tottering toward the spot\nin sufficient time to drop trou and do his business in just the right\nspot.\n\n(Alan learned to pay attention when Bruce was reluctant to leave home\nfor a walk during those days -- the same premonition that made him\nperfectly toilet-trained at home would have him in fretting sweats at\nthe foreknowledge that he has destined to soil himself during the\nrecreation.)\n\nHis nightmares ran twice: once just before bed, in clairvoyant preview,\nand again in the depths of REM sleep. Alan learned to talk him down from\nthese crises, to soothe the worry, and in the end it worked to\neveryone's advantage, defusing the nightmares themselves when they came.\n\nHe never forgot anything -- never forgot to have Alan forge a signature\non a permission form, never forgot to bring in the fossil he'd found for\nshow-and-tell, never forgot his mittens in the cloakroom and came home\nwith red, chapped hands. Once he started school, he started seeing to it\nthat Alan never forgot anything, either.\n\nHe did very well on quizzes and tests, and he never let the pitcher fake\nhim out when he was at bat.\n\nAfter four years alone with the golems, Alan couldn't have been more\nglad to have a brother to keep him company.\n\nBilly got big enough to walk, then big enough to pick mushrooms, then\nbig enough to chase squirrels. He was big enough to play\nhide-and-go-seek with, big enough to play twenty questions with, big\nenough to horse around in the middle of the lake at the center of the\nmountain with.\n\nAlan left him alone during the days, in the company of their parents and\nthe golems, went down the mountain to school, and when he got back, he'd\ntake his kid brother out on the mountain face and teach him what he'd\nlearned, even though he was only a little kid. They'd write letters\ntogether in the mud with a stick, and in the winter, they'd try to spell\nout their names with steaming pee in the snow, laughing.\n\n\"That's a fraction,\" Brad said, chalking \"3\/4\" on a piece of slate by\nthe side of one of the snowmelt streams that coursed down the springtime\nmountain.\n\n\"That's right, three-over-four,\" Alan said. He'd learned it that day in\nschool, and had been about to show it to Billy, which meant that Brad\nhad remembered him doing it and now knew it. He took the chalk and drew\nhis own 3\/4 -- you had to do that, or Billy wouldn't be able to remember\nit in advance.\n\nBilly got down on his haunches. He was a dark kid, dark hair and eyes\nthe color of chocolate, which he insatiably craved and begged for every\nmorning when Alan left for school, \"Bring me, bring me, bring me!\"\n\nHe'd found something. Alan leaned in and saw that it was a milkweed\npod. \"It's an egg,\" Bobby said.\n\n\"No, it's a weed,\" Alan said. Bobby wasn't usually given to flights of\nfancy, but the shape of the pod was reminiscent of an egg.\n\nBilly clucked his tongue. \"I *know* that. It's also an egg for a\nbug. Living inside there. I can see it hatching. Next week.\" He closed\nhis eyes. \"It's orange! Pretty. We should come back and find it once it\nhatches.\"\n\nAlan hunkered down next to him. \"There's a bug in here?\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's like a white worm, but in a week it will turn into an orange\nbug and chew its way out.\"\n\nHe was about three then, which made Alan seven. \"What if I chopped down\nthe plant?\" he said. \"Would the bug still hatch next week?\"\n\n\"You won't,\" Billy said.\n\n\"I could, though.\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Brad said.\n\nAlan reached for the plant. Took it in his hand. The warm skin of the\nplant and the woody bole of the pod would be so easy to uproot.\n\nHe didn't do it.\n\nThat night, as he lay himself down to sleep, he couldn't remember why he\nhadn't. He couldn't sleep. He got up and looked out the front of the\ncave, at the countryside unrolling in the moonlight and the far lights\nof the town.\n\nHe went back inside and looked in on Benji. He was sleeping, his face\nsmooth and his lips pouted. He rolled over and opened his eyes,\nregarding Alan without surprise.\n\n\"Told you so,\" he said.\n\n#\n\nAlan had an awkward relationship with the people in town. Unaccompanied\nlittle boys in the grocery store, at the Gap, in the library and in toy\nsection of the Canadian Tire were suspect. Alan never \"horsed around\" --\nwhatever that meant -- but nevertheless, he got more than his share of\nthe hairy eyeball from the shopkeepers, even though he had money in his\npocket and had been known to spend it on occasion.\n\nA lone boy of five or six or seven was suspicious, but let him show up\nwith the tiny hand of his dark little brother clasped in his, quietly\nexplaining each item on the shelf to the solemn child, and everyone got\nan immediate attitude adjustment. Shopkeepers smiled and nodded,\nshoppers mouthed, \"So cute,\" to each other. Moms with babies in snuglis\nbent to chuckle them under their chins. Store owners spontaneously gave\nthem candy, and laughed aloud at Bryan's cries of \"Chocolate!\"\n\nWhen Brian started school, he foresaw and avoided all trouble, and\ndelighted his teachers with his precociousness. Alan ate lunch with him\nonce he reached the first grade and started eating in the cafeteria with\nthe rest of the non-kindergartners.\n\nBrad loved to play with Craig after he was born, patiently mounding soil\nand pebbles on his shore, watering him and patting him smooth, planting\nwild grasses on his slopes as he crept toward the mouth of the\ncave. Those days -- before Darcy's arrival -- were a long idyll of good\nfood and play in the hot sun or the white snow and brotherhood.\n\nDanny couldn't sneak up on Brad and kick him in the back of the head. He\ncouldn't hide a rat in his pillow or piss on his toothbrush. Billy was\nnever one to stand pat and eat shit just because Davey was handing it\nout. Sometimes he'd just wind up and take a swing at Davey, seemingly\nout of the blue, knocking him down, then prying open his mouth to reveal\nthe chocolate bar he'd nicked from under Brad's pillow, or a comic book\nfrom under his shirt. He was only two years younger than Brad, but by\nthe time they were both walking, Brad hulked over him and could lay him\nout with one wild haymaker of a punch.\n\n#\n\nBilly came down from his high perch when Alan returned from burying\nMarci, holding out his hands wordlessly. He hugged Alan hard, crushing\nthe breath out of him.\n\nThe arms felt good around his neck, so he stopped letting himself feel\nthem. He pulled back stiffly and looked at Brian.\n\n\"You could have told me,\" he said.\n\nBram's face went expressionless and hard and cold. Telling people wasn't\nwhat he did, not for years. It hurt others -- and it hurt him. It was\nthe reason for his long, long silences. Alan knew that sometimes he\ncouldn't tell what it was that he knew that others didn't. But he didn't\ncare, then.\n\n\"You should have told me,\" he said.\n\nBob took a step back and squared up his shoulders and his feet, leaning\nforward a little as into a wind.\n\n\"You *knew* and you didn't *tell me* and you didn't *do anything* and as\nfar as I'm concerned, you killed her and cut her up and buried her along\nwith Darryl, you coward.\" Adam knew he was crossing a line, and he\ndidn't care. Brian leaned forward and jutted his chin out.\n\nAvram's hands were clawed with cold and caked with mud and still echoing\nthe feeling of frozen skin and frozen dirt, and balled up into fists,\nthey felt like stones.\n\nHe didn't hit Barry. Instead, he retreated to his niche and retrieved\nthe triangular piece of flint that he'd been cherting into an arrowhead\nfor school and a hammer stone and set to work on it in the light of a\nflashlight.\n\n#\n\nHe sharpened a knife for Davey, there in his room in the cave, as the\nboys ran feral in the woods, as the mountain made its slow and ponderous\nprotests.\n\nHe sharpened a knife, a hunting knife with a rusty blade and a cracked\nhandle that he'd found on one of the woodland trails, beside a hunter's\nsnare, not lost but pitched away in disgust one winter and not\ndiscovered until the following spring.\n\nBut the nicked blade took an edge as he whetted it with the round stone,\nand the handle regained its grippiness as he wound a cord tight around\nit, making tiny, precise knots with each turn, until the handle no\nlonger pinched his hand, until the blade caught the available light from\nthe cave mouth and glinted dully.\n\nThe boys brought him roots and fruits they'd gathered, sweets and bread\nthey'd stolen, small animals they'd caught. Ed-Fred-George were an\nunbeatable team when it came to catching and killing an animal, though\nthey were only small, barely out of the second grade. They were fast,\nand they could coordinate their actions without speaking, so that the\nbunny or the squirrel could never duck or feint in any direction without\nencountering the thick, neck-wringing outstretched hands of the pudgy\nboys. Once, they brought him a cat. It went in the night's stew.\n\nBilly sat at his side and talked. The silence he'd folded himself in\nunwrapped and flapped in the wind of his beating gums. He talked about\nthe lessons he'd had in school and the lessons he'd had from his big\nbrother, when it was just the two of them on the hillside and Alan would\nteach him every thing he knew, the names of and salient facts regarding\nevery thing in their father's domain. He talked about the truths he'd\ngleaned from reading chocolate-bar wrappers. He talked about the things\nthat he'd see Davey doing when no one else could see it.\n\nOne day, George came to him, the lima-bean baby grown to toddling about\non two sturdy legs, fat and crispy red from his unaccustomed time\nout-of-doors and in the sun. \"You know, he *worships* you,\" Glenn said,\ngesturing at the spot in his straw bedding where Brad habitually sat and\ngazed at him and chattered.\n\nAlan stared at his shoelaces. \"It doesn't matter,\" he said. He'd dreamt\nthat night of Davey stealing into the cave and squatting beside him,\nwatching him the way that he had before, and of Alan knowing, *knowing*\nthat Davey was there, ready to rend and tear, knowing that his knife\nwith its coiled handle was just under his pillow, but not being able to\nmove his arms or legs. Paralyzed, he'd watched Davey grin and reach\nbehind him with agonizing slowness for a rock that he'd lifted high\nabove his head and Andrew had seen that the rock had been cherted to a\nrazor edge that hovered a few feet over his breastbone, Davey's arms\ntrembling with the effort of holding it aloft. A single drop of sweat\nhad fallen off of Davey's chin and landed on Alan's nose, and then\nanother, and finally he'd been able to open his eyes and wake himself,\nangry and scared. The spring rains had begun, and the condensation was\nthick on the cave walls, dripping onto his face and arms and legs as he\nslept, leaving behind chalky lime residue as it evaporated.\n\n\"He didn't kill her,\" Greg said.\n\nAlbert hadn't told the younger brothers about the body buried in Craig,\nwhich meant that Brad had been talking to them, had told them what he'd\nseen. Alan felt an irrational streak of anger at Brad -- he'd been\nblabbing Alan's secrets. He'd been exposing the young ones to things\nthey didn't need to know. To the nightmares.\n\n\"He didn't stop her from being killed,\" Alan said. He had the knife in\nhis hand and hunted through his pile of belongings for the whetstone to\nhone its edge.\n\nGreg looked at the knife, and Andy followed his gaze to his own white\nknuckles on the hilt. Greg took a frightened step back, and Alan, who\nhad often worried that the smallest brother was too delicate for the\nreal world, felt ashamed of himself.\n\nHe set the knife down and stood, stretching his limbs and leaving the\ncave for the first time in weeks.\n\n#\n\nBrad found him standing on the slopes of the gentle, soggy hump of\nCharlie's slope, a few feet closer to the seaway than it had been that\nwinter when Alan had dug up and reburied Marci's body there.\n\n\"You forgot this,\" Brad said, handing him the knife.\n\nAlan took it from him. It was sharp and dirty and the handle was grimed\nwith sweat and lime.\n\n\"Thanks, kid,\" he said. He reached down and took Billy's hand, the way\nhe'd done when it was just the two of them. The three eldest sons of the\nmountain stood there touching and watched the outside world rush and\ngrind away in the distance, its humming engines and puffing chimneys.\n\nBrendan tugged his hand free and kicked at the dirt with a toe,\nsmoothing over the divot he'd made with the sole of his shoe. Andy\nnoticed that the sneaker was worn out and had a hole in the toe, and\nthat it was only laced up halfway.\n\n\"Got to get you new shoes,\" he said, bending down to relace them. He had\nto stick the knife in the ground to free his hands while he worked. The\nhandle vibrated.\n\n\"Davey's coming,\" Benny said. \"Coming now.\"\n\nAlan reached out as in his dream and felt for the knife, but it wasn't\nthere, as in his dream. He looked around as the skin on his face\ntightened and his heart began to pound in his ears, and he saw that it\nhad merely fallen over in the dirt. He picked it up and saw that where\nit had fallen, it had knocked away the soil that had barely covered up a\nsmall, freckled hand, now gone black and curled into a fist like a\nmonkey's paw. Marci's hand.\n\n\"He's coming.\" Benny took a step off the hill. \"You won't lose,\" he\nsaid. \"You've got the knife.\"\n\nThe hand was small and fisted, there in the dirt. It had been just below\nthe surface of where he'd been standing. It had been there, in\nClarence's soil, for months, decomposing, the last of Marci\ngoing. Somewhere just below that soil was her head, her face sloughing\noff and wormed. Her red hair fallen from her loosened scalp. He gagged\nand a gush of bile sprayed the hillside.\n\nDanny hit him at the knees, knocking him into the dirt. He felt the\nlittle rotting fist digging into his ribs. His body bucked of its own\naccord, and he knocked Danny loose of his legs. His arm was hot and\nslippery, and when he looked at it he saw that it was coursing with\nblood. The knife in his other hand was bloodied and he saw that he'd\ndrawn a long ragged cut along his bicep. A fountain of blood bubbled\nthere with every beat of his heart, blub, blub, blub, and on the third\nblub, he felt the cut, like a long pin stuck in the nerve.\n\nHe climbed unsteadily to his feet and confronted Danny. Danny was naked\nand the color of the red golem clay. His ribs showed and his hair was\nmatted and greasy.\n\n\"I'm coming home,\" Danny said, baring his teeth. His breath reeked of\ncorruption and uncooked meat, and his mouth was ringed with a crust of\ndried vomit. \"And you're not going to stop me.\"\n\n\"You don't have a home,\" Alan said, pressing the hilt of the knife over\nthe wound in his bicep, the feeling like biting down on a cracked\ntooth. \"You're not welcome.\"\n\nDavey was monkeyed over low, arms swinging like a chimp, teeth bared,\nknees splayed and ready to uncoil and pounce. \"You think you'll stab me\nwith that?\" he said, jerking his chin at the knife. \"Or are you just\ngoing to bleed yourself out with it?\"\n\nAlan steadied his knife hand before him, unmindful of the sticky\nblood. He knew that the pounce was coming, but that didn't help when it\ncame. Davey leapt for him and he slashed once with the knife, Davey\nducking beneath the arc, and then Davey had his forearm in his hands,\nhis teeth fastened onto the meat of his knife thumb.\n\nAndre rolled to one side and gripped down hard on the knife, tugging his\narm ineffectually against the grip of the cruel teeth and the grasping\nbony fingers. Davey had lost his boyish charm, gone simian with filth\nand rage, and the sore and weak blows Alan was able to muster with his\nhurt arm didn't seem to register with Danny at all as he bit down\nharder.\n\nArnold dragged his arm up higher, dragging the glinting knifetip toward\nDavey's face. Drew kicked at his shins, planted a knee alongside his\ngroin. Alan whipped his head back, then brought it forward as fast and\nhard as he could, hammering his forehead into the crown of Davey's head\nso hard that his head rang like a bell.\n\nHe stunned Davey free of his hand and stunned himself onto his back. He\nfelt small hands beneath each armpit, dragging him clear of the\nhill. Brian. And George. They helped him to his feet and Breton handed\nhim the knife again. Darren got onto his knees, and then to his feet,\nholding the back of his head.\n\nThey both swayed slightly, standing to either side of Chris's\nrise. Alan's knife-hand was red with blood streaming from the bite\nwounds and his other arm felt unaccountably heavy now.\n\nDavey was staggering back and forth a little, eyes dropping to the\nearth. Suddenly, he dropped to one knee and scrabbled in the dirt, then\nscrambled back with something in his hand.\n\nMarci's fist.\n\nHe waggled it at Andrew mockingly, then charged, crossing the distance\nbetween them with long, loping strides, the fist held out before him\nlike a lance. Alan forgot the knife in his hand and shrank back, and\nthen Davey was on him again, dropping the fist to the mud and taking\nhold of Alan's knife-wrist, digging his ragged nails into the bleeding\nbites there.\n\nNow Alan released the knife, so that it, too, fell to the mud, and the\nsound it made woke him from his reverie. He pulled his hand free of\nDavey's grip and punched him in the ear as hard as he could,\nsimultaneously kneeing him in the groin. Davey hissed and punched him in\nthe eye, a feeling like his eyeball was going to break open, a feeling\nlike he'd been stabbed in the back of his eye socket.\n\nHe planted a foot in the mud for leverage, then flipped Danny over so\nthat Alan was on top, knees on his skinny chest. The knife was there\nbeside Davey's head, and Alan snatched it up, holding it ready for\nstabbing.\n\nDanny's eyes narrowed.\n\nAlan could do it. Kill him altogether dead finished yeah. Stab him in\nthe face or the heart or the lung, somewhere fatal. He could kill Davey\nand make him go away forever.\n\nDavey caught his eye and held it. And Alan knew he couldn't do it, and\nan instant later, Davey knew it, too. He smiled a crusty smile and went\nlimp.\n\n\"Oh, don't hurt me, *please*,\" he said mockingly. \"Please, big brother,\ndon't stab me with your big bad knife!\"\n\nAlan hurt all over, but especially on his bicep and his thumb. His head\nsang with pain and blood loss.\n\n\"Don't hurt me, please!\" Davey said.\n\nBilly was standing before him, suddenly.\n\n\"That's what Marci said when he took her, 'Don't hurt me, please,'\" he\nsaid. \"She said it over and over again. While he dragged her here. While\nhe choked her to death.\"\n\nAlan held the knife tighter.\n\n\"He said it over and over again as he cut her up and buried her. He\n*laughed.*\"\n\nDanny suddenly bucked hard, almost throwing him, and before he had time\nto think, Alan had slashed down with the knife, aiming for the face, the\nthroat, the lung. The tip landed in the middle of his bony chest and\nskated over each rib, going *tink, tink, tink* through the handle, like\na xylophone. It scored along the emaciated and distended belly, then\nsank in just to one side of the smooth patch where a real person --\nwhere Marci -- would have a navel.\n\nDavey howled and twisted free of the seeking edge, skipping back three\nsteps while holding in the loop of gut that was trailing free of the\nincision.\n\n\"She said, 'Don't hurt me.' She said, 'Please.' Over and over. He said\nit, too, and he laughed at her.\" Benny chanted it at him, standing just\nbehind him, and the sound of his voice filled Alan's ears.\n\nSuddenly Davey reeled back as a stone rebounded off of his\nshoulder. They both looked in the direction it had come from, and saw\nGeorge, with the tail of his shirt aproned before him, filled with\nsmall, jagged stones from the edge of the hot spring in their father's\ndepths. They took turns throwing those stones, skimming them over the\nwater, and Ed and Fred and George had a vicious arm.\n\nDavey turned and snarled and started upslope toward George, and a stone\ntook him in the back of the neck, thrown by Freddie, who had sought\ncover behind a thick pine that couldn't disguise the red of his\nwindbreaker, red as the inside of his lip, which pouted out as he\nconsidered his next toss.\n\nHe was downslope, and so Drew was able to bridge the distance between\nthem very quickly -- he was almost upon Felix when a third stone, bigger\nand faster than the others, took him in the back of the head with\nterrible speed, making a sound like a hammer missing the nail and\nhitting solid wood instead.\n\nIt was Ernie, of course, standing on Craig's highest point, winding up\nfor another toss.\n\nThe threesome's second volley hit him all at once, from three sides,\nhigh, low, and medium.\n\n\"Killed her, cut her up, buried her,\" Benny chanted. \"Sliced her open\nand cut her up,\" he called.\n\n\"SHUT UP!\" Davey screamed. He was bleeding from the back of his head,\nthe blood trickling down the knobs of his spine, and he was crying,\nsobbing.\n\n\"KILLED HER, CUT HER UP, SLICED HER OPEN,\" Ed-Fred-George chanted in\nunison.\n\nAlan tightened his grip on the cords wound around the handle of his\nknife, and his knife hand bled from the puncture wounds left by Davey's\nteeth.\n\nDavey saw him coming and dropped to his knees, crying. Sobbing.\n\n\"Please,\" he said, holding his hands out before him, palms together,\nbegging.\n\n\"Please,\" he said, as the loop of intestine he'd been holding in trailed\nfree.\n\n\"Please,\" he said, as Alan seized him by the hair, jerked his head back,\nand swiftly brought the knife across his throat.\n\nBenny took his knife, and Ed-Fred-George coaxed Clarence into a slow,\ndeep fissuring. They dragged the body into the earthy crack and Clarence\nswallowed up their brother.\n\nBenny led Alan to the cave, where they'd changed his bedding and laid\nout a half-eaten candy bar, a shopping bag filled with bramble-berries,\nand a lock of Marci's hair, tied into a knot.\n\n#\n\nAlan dragged all of his suitcases up from the basement to the living\nroom, from the tiny tin valise plastered with genuine vintage deco\nrailway stickers to the steamer trunk that he'd always intended to\nrefurbish as a bathroom cabinet. He hadn't been home in fifteen\nyears. What should he bring?\n\nClothes were the easiest. It was coming up on the cusp of July and\nAugust, and he remembered boyhood summers on the mountain's slopes abuzz\nwith blackflies and syrupy heat. White T-shirts, lightweight trousers,\nhigh-tech hiking boots that breathed, a thin jacket for the mosquitoes\nat dusk.\n\nHe decided to pack four changes of clothes, which made a very small pile\non the sofa. Small suitcase. The little rolling carry-on? The wheels\nwould be useless on the rough cave floor.\n\nHe paced and looked at the spines of his books, and paced more, into the\nkitchen. It was a beautiful summer day and the tall grasses in the back\nyard nodded in the soft breeze. He stepped through the screen door and\nout into the garden and let the wild grasses scrape over his thighs. Ivy\nand wild sunflowers climbed the fence that separated his yard from his\nneighbors, and through the chinks in the green armor, he saw someone\nmoving.\n\nMimi.\n\nPacing her garden, neatly tended vegetable beds, some flowering\nbulbs. Skirt and a cream linen blazer that rucked up over her shoulders,\nmoving restlessly. Powerfully.\n\nAlan's breath caught in his throat. Her pale, round calves flashed in\nthe sun. He felt himself harden, painfully. He must have gasped, or\ngiven some sign, or perhaps she heard his skin tighten over his body\ninto a great goosepimply mass. Her head turned.\n\nTheir eyes met and he jolted. He was frozen in his footsteps by her\ngaze. One cheek was livid with a purple bruise, the eye above it slitted\nand puffed. She took a step toward him, her jacket opening to reveal a\nshapeless grey sweatshirt stained with food and -- blood?\n\n\"Mimi?\" he breathed.\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, her face turning into a fright mask.\n\n\"Abel,\" she said. \"Nice day.\"\n\n\"Are you all right?\" he said. He'd had his girls, his employees, show up\nfor work in this state before. He knew the signs. \"Is he in the house\nnow?\"\n\nShe pulled up a corner of her lip into a sneer and he saw that it was\nsplit, and a trickle of blood wet her teeth and stained them pink.\n\n\"Sleeping,\" she said.\n\nHe swallowed. \"I can call the cops, or a shelter, or both.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I gave as good as I got,\" she said. \"We're more than\neven.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" he said. \"'Even' is irrelevant. Are you *safe*?\"\n\n\"Safe as houses,\" she said. \"Thanks for your concern.\" She turned back\ntoward her back door.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said. She shrugged and the wings under her jacket strained\nagainst the fabric. She reached for the door. He jammed his fingers into\nthe chain-link near the top and hauled himself, scrambling, over the\nfence, landing on all fours in a splintering of tomato plants and\nsticks.\n\nHe got to his feet and bridged the distance between them.\n\n\"I don't believe you, Mimi,\" he said. \"I don't believe you. Come over to\nmy place and let me get you a cup of coffee and an ice pack and we'll\ntalk about it, please?\"\n\n\"Fuck off,\" she said tugging at the door. He wedged his toe in it, took\nher wrist gently.\n\n\"Please,\" she said. \"We'll wake him.\"\n\n\"Come over,\" he said. \"We won't wake him.\"\n\nShe cracked her arm like a whip, shaking his hand off her wrist. She\nstared at him out of her swollen eye and he felt the jolt again. Some\nrecognition. Some shock. Some mirror, his face tiny and distorted in her\neye.\n\nShe shivered.\n\n\"Help me over the fence,\" she said pulling her skirt between her knees\n-- bruise on her thigh -- and tucking it behind her into her\nwaistband. She jammed her bare toes into the link and he gripped one\nhard, straining calf in one hand and put the other on her padded, soft\nbottom, helping her up onto a perch atop the fence. He scrambled over\nand then took one bare foot, one warm calf, and guided her down.\n\n\"Come inside,\" he said.\n\nShe'd never been in his house. Natalie and Link went in and out to use\nhis bathroom while they were enjoying the sunset on his porch, or to get\na beer. But Mimi had never crossed his threshold. When she did, it felt\nlike something he'd been missing there had been finally found.\n\nShe looked around with a hint of a smile on her puffed lips. She ran her\nfingers over the cast-iron gas range he'd restored, caressing the\nbakelite knobs. She peered at the titles of the books in the kitchen\nbookcases, over the honey wood of the mismatched chairs and the\nsmoothed-over scars of the big, simple table.\n\n\"Come into the living room,\" Alan said. \"I'll get you an ice pack.\"\n\nShe let him guide her by the elbow, then crossed decisively to the\nwindows and drew the curtains, bringing on twilight. He moved aside his\npiles of clothes and stacked up the suitcases in a corner.\n\n\"Going somewhere?\"\n\n\"To see my family,\" he said. She smiled and her lip cracked anew,\ndripping a single dark droplet of blood onto the gleaming wood of the\nfloor, where it beaded like water on wax paper.\n\n\"Home again, home again, jiggety jig,\" she said. Her nearly closed eye\nwas bright and it darted around the room, taking in shelves, fireplace,\nchairs, clothes.\n\n\"I'll get you that ice pack,\" he said. As he went back into the kitchen,\nhe heard her walking around in the living room, and he remembered the\nfirst time he'd met her, of walking around her living room and thinking\nabout slipping a VCD into his pocket.\n\nHe found her halfway up the staircase with one of the shallow\nbric-a-brac cabinets open before her. She was holding a\nMade-in-Occupied-Japan tin robot, the paint crazed with age into\ncraquelaire like a Dutch Master painting in a gallery.\n\n\"Turn it upside down,\" he said.\n\nShe looked at him, then turned it over, revealing the insides of the\ntin, revealing the gaudily printed tuna-fish label from the original can\nthat it had been fashioned from.\n\n\"Huh,\" she said and peered down into it. He hit the light switch at the\nbottom of the stairs so that she could see better. \"Beautiful,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Have it,\" he said surprising himself. He'd have to remove it from The\nInventory. He restrained himself from going upstairs and doing it before\nhe forgot.\n\nFor the first time he could remember, she looked flustered. Her\nunbruised cheek went crimson.\n\n\"I couldn't,\" she said.\n\n\"It's yours,\" he said. He went up the stairs and closed the cabinet,\nthen folded her fingers around the robot and led her by the wrist back\ndown to the sofa. \"Ice pack,\" he said handing it to her, releasing her\nwrist.\n\nShe sat stiff-spined in on the sofa, the hump of her wings behind her\nkeeping her from reclining. She caught him staring.\n\n\"It's time to trim them,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, yes?\" he said, mind going back to the gridwork of old scars by her\nshoulders.\n\n\"When they get too big, I can't sit properly or lie on my back. At least\nnot while I'm wearing a shirt.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you, I don't know, cut the back out of a shirt?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Or go topless. Or wear a halter. But not in public.\"\n\n\"No, not in public. Secrets must be kept.\"\n\n\"You've got a lot of secrets, huh?\" she said.\n\n\"Some,\" he said.\n\n\"Deep, dark ones?\"\n\n\"All secrets become deep. All secrets become dark. That's in the nature\nof secrets.\"\n\nShe pressed the towel-wrapped bag of ice to her face and rolled her head\nback and forth on her neck. He heard pops and crackles as her muscles\nand vertebrae unlimbered.\n\n\"Hang on,\" he said. He ran up to his room and dug through his T-shirt\ndrawer until he found one that he didn't mind parting with. He brought\nit back downstairs and held it up for her to see. \"Steel Pole Bathtub,\"\nhe said. \"Retro chic. I can cut the back out for you, at least while\nyou're here.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes. \"I'd like that,\" she said in a small voice.\n\nSo he got his kitchen shears and went to work on the back of the shirt,\ncutting a sizable hole in the back of the fabric. He folded duct tape\naround the ragged edges to keep them from fraying. She watched\nbemusedly.\n\n\"Freakshow Martha Stewart,\" she said.\n\nHe smiled and passed her the shirt. \"I'll give you some privacy,\" he\nsaid, and went back into the kitchen and put away the shears and the\ntape. He tried not to listen to the soft rustle of clothing in the other\nroom.\n\n\"Alan,\" she said -- *Alan* and not *Asshole* or *Abel* -- \"I could use\nsome help.\"\n\nHe stepped cautiously into the living room and saw there, in the\ncurtained twilight, Mimi. She was topless, heavy breasts marked red with\nthe outline of her bra straps and wires. They hung weightily, swaying,\nand stopped him in the doorway. She had her arms lifted over her head,\ntugging her round belly up, stretching her navel into a cat-eye\nslit. The T-shirt he'd given her was tangled in her arms and in her\nwings.\n\nHer magnificent wings.\n\nThey were four feet long each, and they stretched, one through the neck\nhole and the other through the hole he'd cut in the T-shirt's back. They\nwere leathery as he remembered, covered in a downy fur that glowed where\nit was kissed by the few shafts of light piercing the gap in the\ndrapes. He reached for the questing, almost prehensile tip of the one\nthat was caught in the neck hole. It was muscular, like a strong finger,\ncurling against his palm like a Masonic handshake.\n\nWhen he touched her wing, she gasped and shivered, indeterminately\nbetween erotic and outraged. They were as he imagined them, these wings,\nstrong and primal and dark and spicy-smelling like an armpit after sex.\n\nHe gently guided the tip down toward the neck hole and marveled at the\nintricate way that it folded in on itself, at the play of mysterious\nmuscle and cartilage, the rustle of bristling hair, and the motility of\nthe skin.\n\nIt accordioned down and he tugged the shirt around it so that it came\nfree, and then he slid the front of the shirt down over her breasts,\npainfully aware of his erection as the fabric rustled down over her\nrounded belly.\n\nAs her head emerged through the shirt, she shook her hair out and then\nunfolded her wings, slowly and exquisitely, like a cat stretching out,\nbending forward, spreading them like sails. He ducked beneath one,\nfeeling its puff of spiced air on his face, and found himself staring at\nthe hash of scars and the rigid ropes of hyperextended muscle and\njoints. Tentatively, he traced the scars with his thumbs, then, when she\nmade no move to stop him, he dug his thumbs into the muscles, into their\ntension.\n\nHe kneaded at her flesh, grinding hard at the knots and feeling them\ngive way, briskly rubbing the spots where they'd been to get the blood\ngoing. Her wings flapped gently around him as he worked, not caring that\nhis body was pretzeled into a knot of its own to reach her back, since\nhe didn't want to break the spell to ask her to move over to give him a\nbetter angle.\n\nHe could smell her armpit and her wings and her hair and he closed his\neyes and worked by touch, following scar to muscle, muscle to knot,\nworking his way the length and breadth of her back, following the muscle\nup from the ridge of her iliac crest like a treasure trail to the muscle\nof her left wing, which was softly twitching with pleasure.\n\nShe went perfectly still again when he took the wing in his hands. It\nhad its own geometry, hard to understand and irresistible. He followed\nthe mysterious and powerful muscles and bones, the vast expanses of\ncartilage, finding knots and squeezing them, kneading her as he'd\nkneaded her back, and she groaned and went limp, leaning back against\nhim so that his face was in her hair and smelling her scalp oil and\nstale shampoo and sweat. It was all he could do to keep himself from\nburying his face in her hair and gnawing at the muscles at the base of\nher skull.\n\nHe moved as slow as a seaweed and ran his hands over to her other wing,\ngiving it the same treatment. He was rock-hard, pressed against her, her\nwings all around him. He traced the line of her jaw to her chin, and\nthey were breathing in unison, and his fingers found the tense place at\nthe hinge and worked there, too.\n\nThen he brushed against her bruised cheek and she startled, and that\nshocked him back to reality. He dropped his hands to his sides and then\nstood, realized his erection was straining at his shorts, sat back down\nagain in one of the club chairs, and crossed his legs.\n\n\"Well,\" he said.\n\nMimi unfolded her wings over the sofa-back and let them spread out, then\nleaned back, eyes closed.\n\n\"You should try the ice-pack again,\" he said weakly. She groped blindly\nfor it and draped it over her face.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she sighed.\n\nHe suppressed the urge to apologize. \"You're welcome,\" he said.\n\n\"It started last week,\" she said. \"My wings had gotten longer. Too\nlong. Krishna came home from the club and he was drunk and he wanted\nsex. Wanted me on the bottom. I couldn't. My wings. He wanted to get the\nknife right away and cut them off. We do it about four times a year,\nusing a big serrated hunting knife he bought at a sporting-goods store\non Yonge Street, one of those places that sells dud grenades and camou\npants and tasers.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes and looked at him, then closed them. He shivered and\na goose walked over his grave.\n\n\"We do it in the tub. I stand in the tub, naked, and he saws off the\nwings right to my shoulders. I don't bleed much. He gives me a towel to\nbite on while he cuts. To scream into. And then we put them in garden\ntrash bags and he puts them out just before the garbage men arrive, so\nthe neighborhood dogs don't get at them. For the meat.\"\n\nHe noticed that he was gripping the arm rests so tightly that his hands\nwere cramping. He pried them loose and tucked them under his thighs.\n\n\"He dragged me into the bathroom. One second, we were rolling around in\nbed, giggling like kids in love, and then he had me so hard by the\nwrist, dragging me naked to the bathroom, his knife in his other fist. I\nhad to keep quiet, so that I wouldn't wake Link and Natalie, but he was\nhurting me, and I was scared. I tried to say something to him, but I\ncould only squeak. He hurled me into the tub and I cracked my head\nagainst the tile. I cried out and he crossed the bathroom and put his\nhand over my mouth and nose and then I couldn't breathe, and my head was\nswimming.\n\n\"He was naked and hard, and he had the knife in his fist, not like for\nslicing, but for stabbing, and his eyes were red from the smoke at the\nclub, and the bathroom filled with the booze-breath smell, and I sank\ndown in the tub, shrinking away from him as he grabbed for me.\n\n\"He -- *growled*. Saw that I was staring at the\nknife. Smiled. Horribly. There's a piece of granite we use for a soap\ndish, balanced in the corner of the tub. Without thinking, I grabbed it\nand threw it as hard as I could at him. It broke his nose and he closed\nhis eyes and reached for his face and I wrapped him up in the shower\ncurtain and grabbed his arm and bit at the base of his thumb so hard I\nheard a bone break and he dropped the knife. I grabbed it and ran back\nto our room and threw it out the window and started to get dressed.\"\n\nShe'd fallen into a monotone now, but her wingtips twitched and her\nknees bounced like her motor was idling on high. She jiggled.\n\n\"You don't have to tell me this,\" he said.\n\nShe took off the ice pack. \"Yes, I do,\" she said. Her eyes seemed to\nhave sunk into her skull, vanishing into dark pits. He'd thought her\neyes were blue, or green, but they looked black now.\n\n\"All right,\" he said.\n\n\"All right,\" she said. \"He came through the door and I didn't scream. I\ndidn't want to wake up Link and Natalie. Isn't that stupid? But I\ncouldn't get my sweatshirt on, and they would have seen my wings. He\nlooked like he was going to kill me. Really. Hands in claws. Teeth\nout. Crouched down low like a chimp, ready to grab, ready to swing. And\nI was back in a corner again, just wearing track pants. He didn't have\nthe knife this time, though.\n\n\"When he came for me, I went limp, like I was too scared to move, and\nsqueezed my eyes shut. Listened to his footsteps approach. Felt the\ncreak of the bed as he stepped up on it. Felt his breath as he reached\nfor me.\n\n\"I exploded. I've read books on women's self-defense, and they talk\nabout doing that, about exploding. You gather in all your energy and\nsqueeze it tight, and then blamo boom, you explode. I was aiming for his\nsoft parts: Balls. Eyes. Nose. Sternum. Ears. I'd misjudged where he\nwas, though, so I missed most of my targets.\n\n\"And then he was on me, kneeling on my tits, hands at my throat. I\nbucked him but I couldn't get him off. My chest and throat were crushed,\nmy wings splayed out behind me. I flapped them and saw his hair move in\nthe breeze. He was sweating hard, off his forehead and off his nose and\nlips. It was all so detailed. And silent. Neither of us made a sound\nlouder than a grunt. Quieter than our sex noises. *Now* I wanted to\nscream, *wanted* to wake up Link and Natalie, but I couldn't get a\nbreath.\n\n\"I worked one hand free and I reached for the erection that I could feel\njust below my tits, reached as fast as a striking snake, grabbed it,\ngrabbed his balls, and I yanked and I squeezed like I was trying to tear\nthem off.\n\n\"I was.\n\n\"Now *he* was trying to get away and I had him cornered. I kept\nsqueezing. That's when he kicked me in the face. I was dazed. He kicked\nme twice more, and I ran downstairs and got a parka from the closet and\nran out into the front yard and out to the park and hid in the bushes\nuntil morning.\n\n\"He was asleep when I came back in, after Natalie and Link had gone\nout. I found the knife beside the house and I went up to our room and I\nstood there, by the window, listening to you talk to them, holding the\nknife.\"\n\nShe plumped herself on the cushions and flapped her wings once, softly,\nanother puff of that warm air wafting over him. She picked up the tin\nrobot he'd given her from the coffee table and turned it over in her\nhands, staring up its skirts at the tuna-fish illustration and the\nJapanese ideograms.\n\n\"I had the knife, and I felt like I had to use it. You know Chekhov? 'If\na gun is on the mantle in the first act, it must go off in the third.' I\nwrite one-act plays. Wrote. But it seemed to me that the knife had been\nin act one, when Krishna dragged me into the bathroom.\n\n\"Or maybe act one was when he brought it home, after I showed him my\nwings.\n\n\"And act two had been my night in the park. And act three was then,\nstanding over him with the knife, cold and sore and tired, looking at\nthe blood crusted on his face.\"\n\nHer face and her voice got very, very small, her expression distant. \"I\nalmost used it on myself. I almost opened my wrists onto his face. He\nliked it when I... rode... his face. Like the hot juices. Seemed\nmean-spirited to spill all that hot juice and deny him that pleasure. I\nthought about using it on him, too, but only for a second.\n\n\"Only for a second.\n\n\"And then he rolled over and his hands clenched into fists in his sleep\nand his expression changed, like he was dreaming about something that\nmade him angry. So I left.\n\n\"Do you want to know about when I first showed him these?\" she said, and\nflapped her wings lazily.\n\nShe took the ice pack from her face and he could see that the swelling\nhad gone down, the discoloration faded to a dim shadow tinged with\nyellows and umbers.\n\nHe did, but he didn't. The breeze of her great wings was strangely\nintimate, that smell more intimate than his touches or the moment in\nwhich he'd glimpsed her fine, weighty breasts with their texture of\nstretch marks and underwire grooves. He was awkward, foolish feeling.\n\n\"I don't think I do,\" he said at last. \"I think that we should save some\nthings to tell each other for later.\"\n\nShe blinked, slow and lazy, and one tear rolled down and dripped off her\nnose, splashing on the red T-shirt and darkening it to wineish purple.\n\n\"Will you sit with me?\" she said.\n\nHe crossed the room and sat on the other end of the sofa, his hand on\nthe seam that joined the two halves together, crossing the border into\nher territory, an invitation that could be refused without awkwardness.\n\nShe covered his hand with hers, and hers was cold and smooth but not\ndistant: immediate, scritching and twitching against his skin. Slowly,\nslowly, she leaned toward him, curling her wing round his far shoulder\nlike a blanket or a lover's arm, head coming to rest on his chest,\nbreath hot on his nipple through the thin fabric of his T-shirt.\n\n\"Alan?\" she murmured into his chest.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"What are we?\" she said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Are we human? Where do we come from? How did we get here? Why do I have\nwings?\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and found that they'd welled up with tears. Once the\nfirst tear slid down his cheek, the rest came, and he was crying,\nweeping silently at first and then braying like a donkey in sobs that\nstarted in his balls and emerged from his throat like vomit, gushing out\nwith hot tears and hot snot.\n\nMimi enveloped him in her wings and kissed his tears away, working down\nhis cheeks to his neck, his Adam's apple.\n\nHe snuffled back a mouthful of mucus and salt and wailed, \"I don't\nknow!\"\n\nShe snugged her mouth up against his collarbone. \"Krishna does,\" she\nwhispered into his skin. She tugged at the skin with her teeth. \"What\nabout your family?\"\n\nHe swallowed a couple of times, painfully aware of her lips and breath\non his skin, the enveloping coolth of her wings, and the smell in every\nbreath he took. He wanted to blow his nose, but he couldn't move without\nbreaking the spell, so he hoarked his sinuses back into his throat and\ndrank the oozing oyster of self-pity that slid down his throat.\n\n\"My family?\"\n\n\"I don't have a family, but you do,\" she said. \"Your family must know.\"\n\n\"They don't,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe you haven't asked them properly. When are you leaving?\"\n\n\"Today.\"\n\n\"Driving?\"\n\n\"Got a rental car,\" he said.\n\n\"Room for one more?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Then take me,\" she said.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. She raised her head and kissed him on the lips,\nand he could taste the smell now, and the blood roared in his ears as\nshe straddled his lap, grinding her mons -- hot through the thin cotton\nof her skirt -- against him. They slid down on the sofa and they groaned\ninto each others' mouths, his voice box resonating with hers.\n\n#\n\nHe parked the rental car in the driveway, finishing his cell phone\nconversation with Lyman and then popping the trunk before getting\nout. He glanced reflexively up at Mimi and Krishna's windows, saw the\nblinds were still drawn.\n\nWhen he got to the living room, Mimi was bent over a suitcase, forcing\nit closed. Two more were lined up beside the door, along with three\nshopping bags filled with tupperwares and ziplocs of food from his\nfridge.\n\n\"I've borrowed some of your clothes,\" she said. \"Didn't want to have to\ngo back for mine. Packed us a picnic, too.\"\n\nHe planted his hands on his hips. \"You thought of everything, huh?\" he\nsaid.\n\nShe cast her eyes down. \"I'm sorry,\" she said in a small voice. \"I\ncouldn't go home.\" Her wings unfolded and folded down again nervously.\n\nHe went and stood next to her. He could still smell the sex on her, and\non him. A livid hickey stood out on her soft skin on her throat. He\ntwined her fingers in his and dropped his face down to her ear.\n\n\"It's okay,\" he said huskily. \"I'm glad you did it.\"\n\nShe turned her head and brushed her lips over his, brushed her hand over\nhis groin. He groaned softly.\n\n\"We have to get driving,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Load the car, then bring it around the side. I'll lie\ndown on the back seat until we're out of the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"You've thought about this a lot, huh?\"\n\n\"It's all I've thought of,\" she said.\n\n#\n\nShe climbed over the back seat once they cleared Queen Street, giggling\nas her wings, trapped under her jacket, brushed the roof of the big\nCrown Victoria he'd rented. She prodded at the radio and found a college\nstation, staticky and amateurish, and nodded her head along with the\nmash-up mixes and concert bootlegs the DJ was spinning.\n\nAlan watched her in the rearview and felt impossibly old and\nstrange. She'd been an incredible and attentive lover, using her hands\nand mouth, her breasts and wings, her whole body to keep him quivering\non the brink of orgasm for what felt like hours, before finally giving\nhim release, and then had guided him around her body with explicit\ninstructions and firm hands on his shoulders. When she came, she\nsqueezed him between her thighs and screamed into his neck, twitching\nand shuddering for a long time afterward, holding him tight, murmuring\nnonsense and hot breath.\n\nIn the dark, she'd seemed older. His age, or some indeterminate\nage. Now, sitting next to him, privately spazzing out to the beat, she\nseemed, oh, 12 or so. A little girl. He felt dirty.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she said, rolling down the window and shouting\nover the wind as they bombed up the Don Valley Parkway. The traffic had\nlet up at Sheppard, and now they were making good time, heading for the\nfaceless surburbs of Richmond Hill and Thornhill, and beyond.\n\n\"North,\" he said. \"Past Kapuskasing.\"\n\nShe whistled. \"How long a drive is it?\"\n\n\"Fifteen hours. Twenty, maybe. Depends on the roads -- you can hit\ncottage traffic or a bad accident and get hung up for hours. There are\ngood motels between Huntsville and North Bay if we get tired out. Nice\nneon signs, magic fingers beds. A place I like has 'Swiss Cabins' and\nmakes a nice rosti for dinner.\"\n\n\"God, that's a long trip,\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, wondering if she wanted out. \"I can pull off here and\ngive you cab fare to the subway station if you wanna stay.\"\n\n\"No!\" she said quickly. \"No. Want to go.\"\n\n#\n\nShe fed him as he drove, slicing cheese and putting it on crackers with\nbits of olive or pepper or salami. It appeared that she'd packed his\nentire fridge in the picnic bags.\n\nAfter suppertime, she went to work on an apple, and he took a closer\nlook at the knife she was using. It was a big, black hunting knife, with\na compass built into the handle. The blade was black except right at the\nedge, where it gleamed sharp in the click-clack of the passing highway\nlights.\n\nHe was transfixed by it, and the car drifted a little, sprayed gravel\nfrom the shoulder, and he overcorrected and fishtailed a little. She\nlooked up in alarm.\n\n\"You brought the knife,\" he said, in response to her unasked question.\n\n\"Couldn't leave it with him,\" she said. \"Besides, a sharp knife is\nhandy.\"\n\n\"Careful you don't slice anything off, okay?\"\n\n\"I never cut anything *unintentionally*,\" she said in a silly-dramatic\nvoice, and socked him in the shoulder.\n\nHe snorted and went back to the driving, putting the hammer down, eating\nup the kilometers toward Huntsville and beyond.\n\nShe fed him slices of apple and ate some herself, then rolls of ham with\nlittle pieces of pear in them, then sips of cherry juice from a glass\nbottle.\n\n\"Enough,\" he said at last. \"I'm stuffed, woman!\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Skinny little fucker -- gotta put some meat on your\nbones.\" She tidied the dinner detritus into an empty shopping bag and\ntossed it over her shoulder into the back seat.\n\n\"So,\" she said. \"How long since you've been home?\"\n\nHe stared at the road for a while. \"Fifteen years,\" he said. \"Never been\nback since I left.\"\n\nShe stared straight forward and worked her hand under his thigh, so he\nwas sitting on it, then wriggled her knuckles.\n\n\"I've never been home,\" she said.\n\nHe wrinkled his brow. \"What's that mean?\" he said.\n\n\"It's a long story,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, let's get off the highway and get a room and you can tell me,\nokay?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she said.\n\n#\n\nThey ended up at the Timberline Wilderness Lodge and Pancake House, and\nMimi clapped her hands at the silk-flowers-and-waterbeds ambience of the\nroom, fondled the grisly jackalope head on the wall, and started running\na tub while Alan carried in the suitcases.\n\nShe dramatically tossed her clothes, one item at a time, out the\nbathroom door, through the clouds of steam, and he caught a glimpse of\nher round, full ass, bracketed by her restless wings, as she poured into\nthe tub the bottle of cheap bubble-bath she'd bought in the lobby.\n\nHe dug a T-shirt and a fresh pair of boxers to sleep in out of his\nsuitcase, feeling ridiculously modest as he donned them. His feet\ncrunched over cigarette burns and tangles in the brown shag carpet and\nhe wished he'd brought along some slippers. He flipped through both\nsnowy TV channels and decided that he couldn't stomach a televangelist\nor a thirty-year-old sitcom right then and flicked it off, sitting on\nthe edge of the bed, listening to the splashing from the bathroom.\n\nMimi was in awfully good spirits, considering what she'd been through\nwith Krishna. He tried to think about it, trying to make sense of the\nday and the girl, but the splashing from the tub kept intruding on his\nthoughts.\n\nShe began to sing, and after a second he recognized the tune. \"White\nRabbit,\" by the Jefferson Airplane. Not the kind of thing he'd expect\nher to be giving voice to; nor she, apparently, for she kept breaking\noff to giggle. Finally, he poked his head through the door.\n\nShe was folded into the tub, knees and tits above the foamline, wings\nslick with water and dripping in the tile. Her hands were out of sight\nbeneath the suds. She caught his eye and grinned crazily, then her hands\nshot out of the pool, clutching the hunting knife.\n\n\"*Put on the White Rabbit!*\" she howled, cackling fiendishly.\n\nHe leapt back and she continued to cackle. \"Come back, come back,\" she\nchoked. \"I'm doing the tub scene from *Fear and Loathing in Las\nVegas*. I thought you were into reading?\"\n\nHe cautiously peeked around the doorjamb, playing it up for comic\neffect. \"Give me the knife,\" he said.\n\n\"Awww,\" she said, handing it over, butt first. He set it down on the\ndresser, then hurried back to the bathroom.\n\n\"Haven't you read all those books?\"\n\nAlan grinned. \"What's the point of a bunch of books you've already\nread?\" He dropped his boxers and stripped off his T-shirt and climbed\ninto the tub, sloshing gallons of water over the scummy tile floor.\n\n#\n\nWhen I was two years old,\n\n(she said, later, as she reclined against the headboard and he reclined\nagainst her, their asses deforming the rusted springs of the mattress so\nthat it sloped toward them and the tins of soda they'd opened to\nreplenish their bodily fluids lost in sweat and otherwise threatened to\ntip over on the slope; she encased him in her wings, shutting out the\nlight and filling their air with the smell of cinnamon and pepper from\nthe downy hair)\n\nWhen I was two years old,\n\n(she said, speaking into the shaggy hair at the back of his neck, as his\nsore muscles trembled and as the sweat dried to a white salt residue on\nhis skin, as he lay there in the dark of the room and the wings,\nwatching the constellation of reflected clock-radio lights in the black\nTV screen)\n\nWhen I was two years old,\n\n(she began, her body tensing from toes to tip in a movement that he felt\nalong the length of his body, portending the time when lovers close\ntheir eyes and open their mouths and utter the secrets that they hide\nfrom everyone, even themselves)\n\nWhen I was two years old, my wings were the size of a cherub's, and they\nhad featherlets that were white as snow. I lived with my \"aunt,\" an old\nRussian lady near Downsview Air Force Base, a blasted suburb where the\nshops all closed on Saturday for Sabbath and the black-hatted Hasids\nmarked the days by walking from one end to the other on their way to\ntemple.\n\nThe old Russian lady took me out for walks in a big black baby buggy the\nsize of a bathtub. She tucked me in tight so that my wings were pinned\nbeneath me. But when we were at home, in her little apartment with the\nwind-up Sputnik that played \"The Internationale,\" she would let my wings\nout and light the candles and watch me wobble around the room, my wings\nflapping, her chin in her hands, her eyes bright. She made me mashed up\ncabbage and seed and beef, and bottles of dilute juice. For dessert, we\nhad hard candies, and I'd toddle around with my toys, drooling sugar\nsyrup while the old Russian lady watched.\n\nBy the time I was four, the feathers had all fallen out, and I was\nsupposed to go to school, I knew that. \"Auntie\" had explained to me that\nthe kids that I saw passing by were on their way to school, and that I'd\ngo some day and learn, too.\n\nShe didn't speak much English, so I grew up speaking a creole of\nRussian, Ukrainian, Polish and English, and I used my words to ask her,\nwith more and more insistence, when I'd get to go to class.\n\nI couldn't read or write, and neither could she. But I could take apart\ngadgets like nobody's business. Someone -- maybe Auntie's long dead\nhusband -- had left her a junky tool kit with cracked handles and\nchipped tips, and I attacked anything that I could get unplugged from\nthe wall: the big cabinet TV and radio, the suitcase record player, the\nSputnik music box. I unwired the lamps and peered at the workings of the\nelectric kitchen clock.\n\nThat was four. Five was the year I put it all back together again. I\nstarted with the lamps, then the motor in the blender, then the toaster\nelements. I made the old TV work. I don't think I knew how any of it\n*really* worked -- couldn't tell you a thing about, you know, electrical\nengineering, but I just got a sense of how it was *supposed* to go\ntogether.\n\nAuntie didn't let me out of the apartment after five. I could watch the\nkids go by from the window -- skinny Hasids with side-curls and\nFilipinos with pretty ribbons and teenagers who smoked, but I couldn't\ngo to them. I watched *Sesame Street* and *Mr. Dressup* and I began to\nsoak up English. I began to soak up the idea of playing with other kids.\n\nI began to soak up the fact that none of the kids on the TV had wings.\n\nAuntie left me alone in the afternoons while she went out shopping and\nbanking and whatever else it was she did, and it was during those times\nthat I could get myself into her bedroom and go rooting around her\nthings.\n\nShe had a lot of mysterious beige foundation garments that were utterly\ninexplicable, and a little box of jewelry that I liked to taste, because\nthe real gold tasted really rich when I sucked on it, and a stack of old\ncigarette tins full of frayed photos.\n\nThe pictures were stiff and mysterious. Faces loomed out of featureless\nblack backgrounds: pop-eyed, jug-eared Russian farm boys, awkward farm\ngirls with process waves in their hair, everyone looking like they'd\nbeen stuffed and mounted. I guess they were her relatives, because if\nyou squinted at them and cocked your head, you could kind of see her\nfeatures in theirs, but not saggy and wrinkled and three-chinned, but\nyoung and tight and almost glowing. They all had big shoulders and\nclothing that looked like the kind of thing the Hasids wore, black and\nsober.\n\nThe faces were interesting, especially after I figured out that one of\nthem might belong to Auntie, but it was the blackness around them that\nfascinated me. The boys had black suits and the girls wore black\ndresses, and behind them was creased blackness, complete darkness, as\nthough they'd put their heads through a black curtain.\n\nBut the more I stared at the blackness, the more detail I picked out. I\nnoticed the edge of a curtain, a fold, in one photo, and when I looked\nfor it, I could just pick it out in the other photos. Eventually, I hit\non the idea of using a water glass as a magnifying lens, and as I\nexperimented with different levels of water, more detail leapt out of\nthe old pictures.\n\nThe curtains hanging behind them were dusty and wrinkled. They looked\nlike they were made of crushed velvet, like the Niagara Falls souvenir\npillow on Auntie's armchair in the living room, which had whorls of\npaisley trimmed into them. I traced these whorls with my eye, and tried\nto reproduce them with a ballpoint on paper bags I found under the sink.\n\nAnd then, in one of the photos, I noticed that the patterns disappeared\nbehind and above the shoulders. I experimented with different water\nlevels in my glass to bring up the magnification, and I diligently\nsketched. I'd seen a *Polka Dot Door* episode where the hosts showed how\nyou could draw a grid over an original image and a matching grid on a\nsheet of blank paper and then copy over every square, reproducing the\nimage in manageable, bite-sized chunks.\n\nThat's what I did, using the edge of a nail file for a ruler, drawing my\ngrid carefully on the paper bag, and a matching one on the picture,\nusing the blunt tip of a dead pen to make a grid of indentations in the\nsurface of the photo.\n\nAnd I sketched it out, one square at a time. Where the pattern was,\nwhere it wasn't. What shapes the negative absence-of-pattern took in the\nphotos. As I drew, day after day, I realized that I was drawing the\nshape of something black that was blocking the curtain behind.\n\nThen I got excited. I drew in my steadiest hand, tracing each curve,\nusing my magnifier, until I had the shape drawn and defined, and long\nbefore I finished, I knew what I was drawing and I drew it anyway. I\ndrew it and then I looked at my paper sack and I saw that what I had\ndrawn was a pair of wings, black and powerful, spread out and stretching\nout of the shot.\n\n#\n\nShe curled the prehensile tips of her wings up the soles of his feet,\nmaking him go, Yeek! and jump in the bed.\n\n\"Are you awake?\" she said, twisting her head around to brush her lips\nover his.\n\n\"Rapt,\" he said.\n\nShe giggled and her tits bounced.\n\n\"Good,\" she said. \"'Cause this is the important part.\"\n\n#\n\nAuntie came home early that day and found me sitting at her vanity, with\nthe photos and the water glass and the drawings on the paper sacks\nspread out before me.\n\nOur eyes met for a moment. Her pupils shrank down to tiny dots, I\nremember it, remember seeing them vanish, leaving behind rings of\nyellowed hazel. One of her hands lashed out in a claw and sank into my\nhair. She lifted me out of the chair by my hair before I'd even had a\nchance to cry out, almost before I'd registered the fact that she was\nhurting me -- she'd never so much as spanked me until then.\n\nShe was strong, in that slow old Russian lady way, strong enough to\ngrunt ten sacks of groceries in a bundle-buggy up the stairs to the\napartment. When she picked me up and tossed me, it was like being fired\nout of a cannon. I rebounded off the framed motel-room art over the bed,\nshattering the glass, and bounced twice on the mattress before coming to\nrest on the floor. My arm was hanging at a funny angle, and when I tried\nto move it, it hurt so much that I heard a high sound in my ears like a\ndog whistle.\n\nI lay still as the old lady yanked the drawers out of her vanity and\nupended them on the floor until she found an old book of matches. She\nswept the photos and my sketches into the tin wastebasket and then lit a\nmatch with trembling hands and dropped it in. It went out. She repeated\nit, and on the fourth try she got the idea of using the match to light\nall the remaining matches in the folder and drop that into the bin. A\nmoment later, it was burning cheerfully, spitting curling red embers\ninto the air on clouds of dark smoke. I buried my face in the matted\ncarpet and tried not to hear that high note, tried to will away the sick\ngrating feeling in my upper arm.\n\nShe was wreathed in smoke, choking, when she finally turned to me. For a\nmoment, I refused to meet her eye, sure that she would kill me if I did,\nwould see the guilt and the knowledge in my face and keep her secret\nwith murder. I'd watched enough daytime television to know about dark\nsecrets.\n\nBut when she bent down to me, with the creak of stretching elastic, and\nshe lifted me to my feet and bent to look me in the eye, she had tears\nin her eyes.\n\nShe went to the pile of oddments and junk jewelry that she had dumped\nout on the floor and sorted through it until she found a pair of sewing\nshears, then she cut away my T-shirt, supporting my broken arm with her\nhand. My wings were flapping nervously beneath the fabric, and it got\ntangled, and she took firm hold of the wingtips and folded them down to\nmy back and freed the shirt and tossed it in the pile of junk on her\nnormally spotless floor.\n\nShe had spoken to me less and less since I had fixed the television and\nbegun to pick up English, and now she was wordless as she gently rotated\nmy fingerbones and my wristbones, my elbow and my shoulder, minute\nmovements, listening for my teakettle hiss when she hit the sore spots.\n\n\"Is broken,\" she said. \"*Cholera*,\" she said. \"I am so sorry, *lovenu*,\"\nshe said.\n\n#\n\n\"I've never been to the doctor's,\" she said. \"Never had a pap smear or\nbeen felt for lumps. Never, ever had an X-ray. Feel this,\" she said, and\nput her upper arm before his face. He took it and ran his fingertips\nover it, finding a hard bump halfway along, opposite her fleshy bicep.\n\n\"What's this?\" he said.\n\n\"It's how a bone sets if you have a bad break and don't get a\ncast. Crooked.\"\n\n\"Jesus,\" he said, giving it another squeeze. Now that he knew what it\nwas, he thought -- or perhaps fancied -- that he could feel how the\nunevenly splintered pieces of bone mated together, met at a slight angle\nand fused together by the knitting process.\n\n\"She made me a sling, and she fed me every meal and brushed my teeth. I\nhad to stop her from following me into the toilet to wipe me up. And I\ndidn't care: She could have broken both of my arms if she'd only\nexplained the photos to me, or left them with me so that I could go on\ninvestigating them, but she did neither. She hardly spoke a word to me.\"\n\nShe resettled herself against the pillows, then pulled him back against\nher again and plumped his head against her breasts.\n\n\"Are you falling in love with me?\" she said.\n\nHe startled. The way she said it, she didn't sound like a young adult,\nshe sounded like a small child.\n\n\"Mimi --\" he began, then stopped himself. \"I don't think so. I mean, I\nlike you --\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said. \"No falling in love, all right?\"\n\n#\n\nAuntie died six months later. She keeled over on the staircase on her\nway up to the apartment, and I heard her moaning and thrashing out\nthere. I hauled her up the stairs with my good arm, and she crawled\nalong on her knees, making gargling noises.\n\nI got her laid out on the rug in the living room. I tried to get her up\non the sofa, but I couldn't budge her. So I gave her pillows from the\nsofa and water and then I tried tea, but she couldn't take it. She threw\nup once, and I soaked it up with a tea towel that had fussy roses on it.\n\nShe took my hand and her grip was weak, her strong hands suddenly thin\nand shaky.\n\nIt took an hour for her to die.\n\nWhen she died, she made a rasping, rattling sound and then she shat\nherself. I could smell it.\n\nIt was all I could smell, as I sat there in the little apartment, six\nyears old, hot as hell outside and stuffy inside. I opened the windows\nand watched the Hasids walk past. I felt like I should *do something*\nfor the old lady, but I didn't know what.\n\nI formulated a plan. I would go outside and bring in some grown-up to\ntake care of the old lady. I would do the grocery shopping and eat\nsandwiches until I was twelve, at which point I would be grown up and I\nwould get a job fixing televisions.\n\nI marched into my room and changed into my best clothes, the little\nAlice-blue dress I wore to dinner on Sundays, and I brushed my hair and\nput on my socks with the blue pom-poms at the ankles, and found my shoes\nin the hall closet. But it had been three years since I'd last worn the\nshoes, and I could barely fit three toes in them. The old lady's shoes\nwere so big I could fit both feet in either one.\n\nI took off my socks -- sometimes I'd seen kids going by barefoot\noutside, but never in just socks -- and reached for the doorknob. I\ntouched it.\n\nI stopped.\n\nI turned around again.\n\nThere was a stain forming under Auntie, piss and shit and death-juice,\nand as I looked at her, I had a firm sense that it wouldn't be *right*\nto bring people up to her apartment with her like this. I'd seen dead\npeople on TV. They were propped up on pillows, in clean hospital\nnighties, with rouged cheeks. I didn't know how far I could get, but I\nthought I owed it to her to try.\n\nI figured that it was better than going outside.\n\nShe was lighter in death, as though something had fled her. I could drag\nher into the bathroom and prop her on the edge of the tub. I needed to\nwash her before anyone else came up.\n\nI cut away her dress with the sewing shears. She was wearing an elastic\ngirdle beneath, and an enormous brassiere, and they were too tough --\ntoo tight -- to cut through, so I struggled with their hooks, each one\ngoing *spung* as I unhooked it, revealing red skin beneath it, pinched\nand sore-looking.\n\nWhen I got to her bra, I had a moment's pause. She was a modest person\n-- I'd never even seen her legs without tan compression hose, but the\nsmell was overwhelming, and I just held to that vision of her in a\nnightie and clean sheets and, you know, *went for it*.\n\nPopped the hooks. Felt it give way as her breasts forced it off her\nback. Found myself staring at.\n\nTwo little wings.\n\nThe size of my thumbs. Bent and cramped. Broken. Folded. There, over her\nshoulder blades. I touched them, and they were cold and hard as a turkey\nneck I'd once found in the trash after she'd made soup with it.\n\n#\n\n\"How did you get out?\"\n\n\"With my wings?\"\n\n\"Yeah. With your wings, and with no shoes, and with the old lady dead\nover the tub?\"\n\nShe nuzzled his neck, then bit it, then kissed it, then bit it\nagain. Brushed her fingers over his nipples.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she breathed, hot in his ear.\n\nHe arched his back. \"You don't know?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That's all I remember, for five years.\"\n\nHe arched his back again, and raked his fingertips over her thighs,\nmaking her shudder and jerk her wings back.\n\nThat's when he saw the corpse at the foot of the bed. It was George.\n\n#\n\nHe went back to school the day after they buried Davey. He bathed all\nthe brothers in the hot spring and got their teeth brushed, and he fed\nthem a hot breakfast of boiled mushroom-and-jerky stew, and he gathered\nup their schoolbooks from the forgotten corners of the winter cave and\nput them into school bags. Then he led them down the hillside on a\nspring day that smelled wonderful: loam and cold water coursing down the\nmountainside in rivulets, and new grass and new growth drying out in a\nhard white sun that seemed to spring directly overhead five minutes\nafter it rose.\n\nThey held hands as they walked down the hill, and then\nElliot-Franky-George broke away and ran down the hill to the roadside,\nskipping over the stones and holding their belly as they flew down the\nhillside. Alan laughed at the impatient jig they danced as they waited\nfor him and Brad to catch up with them, and Brad put an arm around his\nshoulder and kissed him on the cheek in a moment of uncharacteristic\ndemonstrativeness.\n\nHe marched right into Mr. Davenport's office with his brothers in tow.\n\n\"We're back,\" he said.\n\nMr. Davenport peered at them over the tops of his glasses. \"You are, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Mom took sick,\" he said. \"Very sick. We had to go live with our aunt,\nand she was too far away for us to get to school.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Mr. Davenport said.\n\n\"I taught the littler ones as best as I could,\" Alan said. He liked\nMr. Davenport, understood him. He had a job to do, and needed everything\nto be accounted for and filed away. It was okay for Alan and his\nbrothers to miss months of school, provided that they had a good excuse\nwhen they came back. Alan could respect that. \"And I read ahead in my\ntextbooks. I think we'll be okay.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will be,\" Mr. Davenport said. \"How is your mother now?\"\n\n\"She's better,\" he said. \"But she was very sick. In the hospital.\"\n\n\"What was she sick with?\"\n\nAlan hadn't thought this far ahead. He knew how to lie to adults, but he\nwas out of practice. \"Cancer,\" he said, thinking of Marci's mother.\n\n\"Cancer?\" Mr. Davenport said, staring hard at him.\n\n\"But she's better now,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I see. You boys, why don't you get to class? Alan, please wait here a\nmoment.\"\n\nHis brothers filed out of the room. and Alan shuffled nervously, looking\nat the class ring on Mr. Davenport's hairy finger, remembering the time\nthat Davey had kicked him. He'd never asked Alan where Davey was after\nthat, and Alan had never offered, and it had been as though they shared\na secret.\n\n\"Are you all right, Alan?\" he asked, settling down behind his desk,\ntaking off his glasses.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Alan said.\n\n\"You're getting enough to eat at home? There's a quiet place where you\ncan work?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Alan said, squirming. \"It's fine, now that Mom is home.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Mr. Davenport said. \"Listen to me, son,\" he said, putting his\nhands flat on the desk. \"The school district has some resources\navailable: clothes, lunch vouchers, Big Brother programs. They're not\nanything you have to be ashamed of. It's not charity, it's just a little\nbooster. A bit of help. The other children, their parents are well and\nthey live in town and have lots of advantages that you and your brothers\nlack. This is just how we level the playing field. You're a very bright\nlad, and your brothers are growing up well, but it's no sin to accept a\nlittle help.\"\n\nAlan suddenly felt like laughing. \"We're not underprivileged,\" he said,\nthinking of the mountain, of the feeling of being encompassed by love of\nhis father, of the flakes of soft, lustrous gold the golems produced by\nthe handful. \"We're very well off,\" he said, thinking of home, now free\nof Davey and his hateful, spiteful anger. \"Thank you, though,\" he said,\nthinking of his life unfolding before him, free from the terror of\nDavey's bites and spying and rocks thrown from afar.\n\nMr. Davenport scowled and stared hard at him. Alan met his stare and\nsmiled. \"It's time for classes,\" he said. \"Can I go?\"\n\n\"Go,\" Mr. Davenport said. He shook his head. \"But remember, you can\nalways come here if you have anything you want to talk to me about.\"\n\n\"I'll remember,\" Alan said.\n\n#\n\nSix years later, Bradley was big and strong and he was the star goalie\nof all the hockey teams in town, in front of the puck before it arrived,\nmaking desperate, almost nonchalant saves that had them howling in the\nstands, stomping their feet, and sloshing their Tim Horton's coffee over\nthe bleachers, to freeze into brown ice. In the summer, he was the star\npitcher on every softball team, and the girls trailed after him like a\nlong comet tail after the games when the other players led him away to a\npark to drink illicit beers.\n\nAlan watched his games from afar, with his schoolbooks on his lap, and\nEric-Franz-Greg nearby playing trucks or reading or gnawing on a sucker.\n\nBy the ninth inning or the final period, the young ones would be too\ntired to play, and they'd come and lean heavily against Alan, like a bag\nof lead pressing on him, eyes half open, and Alan would put an arm\naround them and feel at one with the universe.\n\nIt snowed on the afternoon of the season opener for the town softball\nleague that year, fat white wet flakes that kissed your cheeks and\nmelted away in an instant, so soft that you weren't sure they'd be there\nat all. Bradley caught up with Alan on their lunch break, at the\ncafeteria in the high school two blocks from the elementary school. He\nhad his mitt with him and a huge grin.\n\n\"You planning on playing through the snow?\" Alan said, as he set down\nhis cheeseburger and stared out the window at the diffuse white radiance\nof the April noontime bouncing off the flakes.\n\n\"It'll be gone by tonight. Gonna be *warm*,\" Bradley said, and nodded at\nhis jock buddies sitting at their long table, sucking down Cokes and\nstaring at the girls. \"Gonna be a good game. I know it.\"\n\nBradley knew. He knew when they were getting shorted at the assayers'\nwhen they brought in the golems' gold, just as he knew that showing up\nfor lunch with a brown bag full of dried squirrel jerky and mushrooms\nand lemongrass was a surefire way to end up social roadkill in the high\nschool hierarchy, as was dressing like someone who'd been caught in an\nexplosion at the Salvation Army, and so he had money and he had burgers\nand he had a pair of narrow-leg jeans from the Gap and a Roots\nsweatshirt and a Stussy baseball hat and Reebok sneakers and he looked,\nbasically, like a real person.\n\nAlan couldn't say the same for himself, but he'd been making an effort\nsince Bradley got to high school, if only to save his brother the\nembarrassment of being related to the biggest reject in the building --\nbut Alan still managed to exude his don't-fuck-with-me aura enough that\nno one tried to cozy up to him and make friends with him and scrutinize\nhis persona close in, which was just as he wanted it.\n\nBradley watched a girl walk past, a cute thing with red hair and\nfreckles and a skinny rawboned look, and Alan remembered that she'd been\nsitting next to him in class for going on two years now and he'd never\nbothered to learn her name.\n\nAnd he'd never bothered to notice that she was a dead ringer for Marci.\n\n\"I've always had a thing for redheads,\" Bradley said. \"Because of you,\"\nhe said. \"You and your girlfriend. I mean, if she was good enough for\n*you*, well, she had to be the epitome of sophistication and\nsexiness. Back then, you were like a god to me, so she was like a\ngoddess. I imprinted on her, like the baby ducks in Bio. It's amazing\nhow much of who I am today I can trace back to those days. Who knew that\nit was all so important?\"\n\nHe was a smart kid, introspective without being\nmoody. Integrated. Always popping off these fine little observations in\nbetween his easy jokes. The girls adored him, the boys admired him, the\nteachers were grateful for him and the way he bridged the gap between\nscholarship and athleticism.\n\n\"I must have been a weird kid,\" he said. \"All that quiet.\"\n\n\"You were a great kid,\" Alan said. \"It was a lot of fun back then,\nmostly.\"\n\n\"Mostly,\" he said.\n\nThey both stared at the girl, who noticed them now, and blushed and\nlooked confused. Bradley looked away, but Alvin held his gaze on her,\nand she whispered to a friend, who looked at him, and they both laughed,\nand then Alan looked away, too, sorry that he'd inadvertently interacted\nwith his fellow students. He was supposed to watch, not participate.\n\n\"He was real,\" Bradley said, and Alan knew he meant Davey.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I don't think the little ones really remember him -- he's more like a\nbad dream to them. But he was real, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said. \"But he's gone now.\"\n\n\"Was it right?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Alan said. He felt a sear of anger arc along his\nspine.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Billy said, mumbling into his tray.\n\n\"What do you mean, Brad?\" Alan said. \"What else should we have done? How\ncan you have any doubts?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" Brad said. \"It's okay.\"\n\nAlan looked down at his hands, which appeared to belong to someone else:\nwhite lumps of dough clenched into hard fists, knuckles white. He made\nhimself unclench them. \"No, it's *not* okay. Tell me about this. You\nremember what he was like. What he...did.\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" Bryan said. \"Of course I remember it.\" He was staring\nthrough the table now, the look he got when he was contemplating a\nfuture the rest of them couldn't see. \"But.\"\n\nAlan waited. He was trembling inside. He'd done the right thing. He'd\nsaved his family. He knew that. But for six years, he'd found himself\nturning in his memory to the little boy on the ground, holding the loops\nof intestine in through slippery red fingers. For six years, whenever\nhe'd been somewhere quiet long enough that his own inner voices fell\nstill, he'd remember the hair in his fist, the knife's thirsty draught\nas it drew forth the hot splash of blood from Davey's throat. He'd\nremembered the ragged fissure that opened down Clarence's length and the\nway that Davey fell down it, so light and desiccated he was almost\nweightless.\n\n\"If you remember it, then you know I did the right thing. I did the only\nthing.\"\n\n\"*We* did the only thing,\" Brian said, and covered Alan's hand with his.\n\nAlan nodded and stared at his cheeseburger. \"You'd better go catch up\nwith your friends,\" he said.\n\n\"I love you, Adam,\" he said.\n\n\"I love you, too.\"\n\nBilly crossed the room, nodding to the people who greeted him from every\ntable, geeks and jocks and band and all the meaningless tribes of the\nhigh school universe. The cute redhead sprinkled a wiggle-finger wave at\nhim, and he nodded at her, the tips of his ears going pink.\n\n#\n\nThe snow stopped by three p.m., and the sun came out and melted it away,\nso that by the time the game started at five-thirty, its only remnant\nwas the soggy ground around the bleachers with the new grass growing out\nof the ragged brown memory of last summer's lawn.\n\nAlan took the little ones for dinner at the diner after school, letting\nthem order double chocolate-chip pancakes. At 13, they'd settled into a\nfatness that made him think of a foam-rubber toy, the rolls and dimples\nat their wrists and elbows and knees like the seams on a doll.\n\n\"You're starting high school next year?\" Alan said, as they were pouring\nsyrup on their second helping. He was startled by this -- how had they\ngotten so old so quickly?\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Eli said. \"I guess.\"\n\n\"So you're graduating from elementary school this spring?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Eli grinned a chocolate smile at him. \"It's no big deal. There's\na party, though.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At some kid's house.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" Alan said. \"We can celebrate at home. Don't let them get to\nyou.\"\n\n\"We can't go?\" Ed suddenly looked a little panicked.\n\n\"You're invited?\" He blurted it out and then wished he hadn't.\n\n\"Of course we're invited,\" Fred said from inside Ed's throat. \"There's\ngoing to be dancing.\"\n\n\"You can dance?\" Alan asked.\n\n\"We can!\" Ed said.\n\n\"We learned in gym,\" Greg said, with the softest, proudest voice, deep\nwithin them.\n\n\"Well,\" Alan said. He didn't know what to say. High\nschool. Dancing. Invited to parties. No one had invited him to parties\nwhen he'd graduated from elementary school, and he'd been too busy with\nthe little ones to go in any event. He felt a little jealous, but mostly\nproud. \"Want a milkshake?\" he asked, mentally totting up the cash in his\npocket and thinking that he should probably send Brad to dicker with the\nassayer again soon.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" Ed said. \"We're watching our weight.\"\n\nAlan laughed, then saw they weren't joking and tried to turn it into a\ncough, but it was too late. Their shy, chocolate smile turned into a\nrubber-lipped pout.\n\n#\n\nThe game started bang on time at six p.m., just as the sun was\nsetting. The diamond lights flicked on with an audible click and made a\nspot of glare that cast out the twilight.\n\nBenny was already on the mound, he'd been warming up with the catcher,\ntossing them in fast and exuberant and confident and controlled. He\nlooked good on the mound. The ump called the start, and the batter\nstepped up to the plate, and Benny struck him out in three pitches, and\nthe little ones went nuts, cheering their brother on along with the\nother fans in the bleachers, a crowd as big as any you'd ever see\noutside of school, thirty or forty people.\n\nThe second batter stepped up and Benny pitched a strike, another strike,\nand then a wild pitch that nearly beaned the batter in the head. The\ncatcher cocked his mask quizzically, and Benny kicked the dirt and\nwindmilled his arm a little and shook his head.\n\nHe tossed another wild one, this one coming in so low that it\npractically rolled across the plate. His teammates were standing up in\ntheir box now, watching him carefully.\n\n\"Stop kidding around,\" Alan heard one of them say. \"Just strike him\nout.\"\n\nBenny smiled, spat, caught the ball, and shrugged his shoulders. He\nwound up, made ready to pitch, and then dropped the ball and fell to his\nknees, crying out as though he'd been struck.\n\nAlan grabbed the little ones' hand and pushed onto the diamond before\nBenny's knees hit the ground. He caught up with Benny as he keeled over\nsideways, bringing his knees up to his chest, eyes open and staring and\nempty.\n\nAlan caught his head and cradled it on his lap and was dimly aware that\na crowd had formed round them. He felt Barry's heart thundering in his\nchest, and his arms were stuck straight out to his sides, one hand in\nhis pitcher's glove, the other clenched tightly around the ball.\n\n\"It's a seizure,\" someone said from the crowd. \"Is he an epileptic? It's\na seizure.\"\n\nSomeone tried to prize Alan's fingers from around Barry's head and he\ngrunted and hissed at them, and they withdrew.\n\n\"Barry?\" Alan said, looking into Barry's face. That faraway look in his\neyes, a million miles away. Alan knew he'd seen it before, but not in\nyears.\n\nThe eyes came back into focus, closed, opened. \"Davey's back,\" Barry\nsaid.\n\nAlan's skin went cold and he realized that he was squeezing Barry's head\nlike a melon. He relaxed his grip and helped him to his feet, got\nBarry's arm around his shoulders, and helped him off the diamond.\n\n\"You okay?\" one of the players asked as they walked past him, but Barry\ndidn't answer. The little ones were walking beside them now, clutching\nBarry's hand, and they turned their back on the town as a family and\nwalked toward the mountain.\n\n#\n\nGeorge had come to visit him once before, not long after Alan'd moved to\nToronto. He couldn't come without bringing down Elliot and Ferdinand, of\ncourse, but it was George's idea to visit, that was clear from the\nmoment they rang the bell of the slightly grotty apartment he'd moved\ninto in the Annex, near the students who were barely older than him but\nseemed to belong to a different species.\n\nThey were about 16 by then, and fat as housecats, with the same sense of\ngrace and inertia in their swinging bellies and wobbling chins.\n\nAlan welcomed them in. Edward was wearing a pair of wool trousers pulled\nnearly up to his nipples and short suspenders that were taut over his\nsweat-stained white shirt. He was grinning fleshily, his hair damp with\nsweat and curled with the humidity.\n\nHe opened his mouth, and George's voice emerged. \"This place is...\" He\nstood with his mouth open, while inside him, George\nthought. \"*Incredible.* I'd never...\" He closed his mouth, then opened\nit again. \"*Dreamed*. What a...\"\n\nNow Ed spoke. \"Jesus, figure out what you're going to say before you say\nit, willya? This is just plain --\"\n\n\"Rude,\" came Fede's voice from his mouth.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" came George's voice.\n\nEd was working on his suspenders, then unbuttoning his shirt and\ndropping his pants, so that he stood in grimy jockeys with his slick,\ntight, hairy belly before Alan. He tipped himself over, and then Alan\nwas face-to-face with Freddy, who was wearing a T-shirt and a pair of\nboxer shorts with blue and white stripes. Freddy was scowling comically,\nand Alan hid a grin behind his hand.\n\nFreddy tipped to one side and there was George, short and delicately\nformed and pale as a frozen french fry. He grabbed Freddy's hips like\nhandles and scrambled out of him, springing into the air and coming down\non the balls of his feet, holding his soccer-ball-sized gut over his\nHulk Underoos.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" he hooted, dancing from one foot to the other. \"It's\nbrilliant! God! I'm never, ever going home!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes?\" Alan said, not bothering to hide his smile as Frederick and\nGeorge separated and righted themselves. \"And where will you sleep,\nthen?\"\n\n\"Here!\" he said, running around the tiny apartment, opening the fridge\nand the stove and the toaster oven, flushing the toilet, turning on the\nshower faucets.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Alan called as he ran by. \"No vacancies at the Hotel Anders!\"\n\n\"Then I won't sleep!\" he cried on his next pass. \"I'll play all night\nand all day in the streets. I'll knock on every door on every street and\nintroduce myself to every person and learn their stories and read their\nbooks and meet their kids and pet their dogs!\"\n\n\"You're bonkers,\" Alan said, using the word that the lunch lady back at\nschool had used when chastising them for tearing around the cafeteria.\n\n\"Easy for you to say,\" Greg said, skidding to a stop in front of\nhim. \"Easy for you -- you're *here*, you got *away*, you don't have to\ndeal with *Davey* --\" He closed his mouth and his hand went to his lips.\n\nAlan was still young and had a penchant for the dramatic, so he went\naround to the kitchen and pulled a bottle of vodka out of the freezer\nand banged it down on the counter, pouring out four shots. He tossed\nback his shot and returned the bottle to the freezer.\n\nGeorge followed suit and choked and turned purple, but managed to keep\nhis expression neutral. Fred and Ed each took a sip, then set the drinks\ndown with a sour face.\n\n\"How's home?\" Alan said quietly, sliding back to sit on the minuscule\ncounter surface in his kitchenette.\n\n\"It's okay,\" Ed mumbled, perching on the arm of the Goodwill sofa that\ncame with the apartment. Without his brothers within him, he moved\nsprightly and lightly.\n\n\"It's fine,\" Fred said, looking out the window at the street below,\ncraning his neck to see Bloor Street and the kids smoking out front of\nthe Brunswick House.\n\n\"It's awful,\" Greg said, and pulled himself back up on the counter with\nthem. \"And I'm not going back.\"\n\nThe two older brothers looked balefully at him, then mutely appealed to\nAlan. This was new -- since infancy, Earl-Frank-Geoff had acted with\ncomplete unity of will. When they were in the first grade, Alan had\nwondered if they were really just one person in three parts -- that was\nhow close their agreements were.\n\n\"Brian left last week,\" Greg said, and drummed his heels on the\ngrease-streaked cabinet doors. \"Didn't say a word to any of us, just\nleft. He comes and goes like that all the time. Sometimes for weeks.\"\n\nCraig was halfway around the world, he was in Toronto, and Brian was\nGod-knew-where. That left just Ed-Fred-George and Davey, alone in the\ncave. No wonder they were here on his doorstep.\n\n\"What's he doing?\"\n\n\"He just sits there and watches us, but that's enough. We're almost\nfinished with school.\" He dropped his chin to his chest. \"I thought we\ncould finish here. Find a job. A place to live.\" He blushed\nfuriously. \"A girl.\"\n\nEd and Fred were staring at their laps. Alan tried to picture the\nlogistics, but he couldn't, not really. There was no scenario in which\nhe could see his brothers carrying on with --\n\n\"Don't be an idiot,\" Ed said. He sounded surprisingly bitter. He was\nusually a cheerful person -- or at least a fat and smiling person. Alan\nrealized for the first time that the two weren't equivalent.\n\nGeorge jutted his chin toward the sofa and his brothers. \"They don't\nknow what they want to do. They think that, 'cause it'll be hard to live\nhere, we should hide out in the cave forever.\"\n\n\"Alan, talk to him,\" Fred said. \"He's nuts.\"\n\n\"Look,\" George said. \"You're gone. You're *all* gone. The king under the\nmountain now is Davey. If we stay there, we'll end up his slaves or his\nvictims. Let him keep it. There's a whole world out here we can live in.\n\n\"I don't see any reason to let my handicap keep me down.\"\n\n\"It's not a handicap,\" Edward said patiently. \"It's just how we\nare. We're different. We're not like the rest of them.\"\n\n\"Neither is Alan,\" George said. \"And here he is, in the big city, living\nwith them. Working. Meeting people. Out of the mountain.\"\n\n\"Alan's more like them than he is like us,\" Frederick said. \"We're not\nlike them. We can't pass for them.\"\n\nAlan's jaw hung slack. Handicapped? Passing? Like them? Not like them?\nHe'd never thought of his brothers this way. They were just his\nbrothers. Just his family. They could communicate with the outside\nworld. They were people. Different, but the same.\n\n\"You're just as good as they are,\" he said.\n\nAnd that shut them up. They all regarded him, as if waiting for him to\ngo on. He didn't know what to say. Were they, really? Was he? Was he\nbetter?\n\n\"What are we, Alan?\" Edward said it, but Frederick and George mouthed\nthe words after he'd said them.\n\n\"You're my brothers,\" he said. \"You're. . .\"\n\n\"I want to see the city,\" George said. \"You two can come with me, or you\ncan meet me when I come back.\"\n\n\"You *can't* go without us,\" Frederick said. \"What if we get hungry?\"\n\n\"You mean, what if I don't come back, right?\"\n\n\"No,\" Frederick said, his face turning red.\n\n\"Well, how hungry are you going to get in a couple hours? You're just\nworried that I'm going to wander off and not come back. Fall into a\nhole. Meet a girl. Get drunk. And you won't ever be able to eat again.\"\nHe was pacing again.\n\nEd and Fred looked imploringly at him.\n\n\"Why don't we all go together?\" Alan said. \"We'll go out and do\nsomething fun -- how about ice-skating?\"\n\n\"Skating?\" George said. \"Jesus, I didn't ride a bus for 30 hours just to\ngo *skating*.\"\n\nEdward said, \"I want to sleep.\"\n\nFrederick said, \"I want dinner.\"\n\nPerfect, Alan thought. \"Perfect. We'll all be equally displeased with\nthis, then. The skating's out in front of City Hall. There are lots of\npeople there, and we can take the subway down. We'll have dinner\nafterward on Queen Street, then turn in early and get a good night's\nsleep. Tomorrow, we'll negotiate something else. Maybe Chinatown and the\nzoo.\"\n\nThey are stared at him.\n\n\"This is a limited-time offer,\" Alan said. \"I had other plans tonight,\nyou know. Going once, going twice --\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" George said. He went and took his brothers' hands. \"Let's\ngo, okay?\"\n\nThey had a really good time.\n\n#\n\nGeorge's body was propped up at the foot of the bed. He was white and\nwrinkled as a big toe in a bathtub, skin pulled tight in his face so\nthat his hairline and eyebrows and cheeks seemed raised in surprise.\n\nAlan smelled him now, a stink like a mouse dead between the gyprock in\nthe walls, the worst smell imaginable. He felt Mimi breathing behind\nhim, her chest heaving against his back. He reached out and pushed aside\nthe wings, moving them by their translucent membranes, fingers brushing\nthe tiny fingerlets at the wingtips, recognizing in their touch some\nevolutionary connection with his own hands.\n\nGeorge toppled over as Alan stepped off the bed, moving in the twilight\nof the light from under the bathroom door. Mimi came off the bed on the\nother side and hit the overhead light switch, turning the room as bright\nas an icebox, making Alan squint painfully. She closed the blinds\nquickly, then went to the door and shot the chain and the deadbolt\nclosed.\n\nMimi looked down at him. \"Ugly sumbitch, whoever he was.\"\n\n\"My brother,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. She went back around the bed and sat on the edge, facing\nthe wall. \"Sorry.\" She crossed her leg and jiggled her foot, making the\nsprings squeak.\n\nAlan wasn't listening. He knelt down and touched George's cheek. The\nskin was soft and spongy, porous and saturated. Cold. His fingertips\ncame away with shed white flakes of translucent skin clinging to them.\n\n\"Davey?\" Alan said. \"Are you in here?\"\n\nMimi's foot stilled. They both listened intently. There were night-time\nsounds in the motel, distant muffled TVs and car engines and fucking,\nbut no sound of papery skin thudding on ground-down carpet.\n\n\"He must have come up through the drain,\" Alan said. \"In the bathroom.\"\nThe broad pale moon of George's belly was abraded in long grey stripes.\n\nHe stood and, wiping his hand on his bare thigh, reached for the\nbathroom doorknob. The door swung open, revealing the\nsanitized-for-your-protection brightness of the bathroom, the water\nsloshed on the floor by Mimi earlier, the heaps of damp towels.\n\n\"How'd he find us here?\"\n\nMimi, in her outsized blazer and track pants, touched him on his bare\nshoulder. He suddenly felt terribly naked. He backed out of the\nbathroom, shoving Mimi aside, and numbly pulled on his jeans and a\nshapeless sweatshirt that smelled of Mimi and had long curly hairs\nlurking in the fabric that stuck to his face like cobwebs. He jammed his\nfeet into his sneakers.\n\nHe realized that he'd had to step over his brother's body six times to\ndo this.\n\nHe looked at his brother again. He couldn't make sense of what he was\nseeing. The abraded belly. The rictus. His balls, shrunk to an albino\nwalnut, his cock shriveled up to unrecognizability. The hair, curly,\nmatted all over his body, patchily rubbed away.\n\nHe paced in the little run beside the bed, the only pacing room he had\nthat didn't require stepping over George's body, back and forth, two\npaces, turn, two paces, turn.\n\n\"I'm going to cover him up,\" Mimi said.\n\n\"Good, fine,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Are you going to be okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, fine,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Are you freaking out?\"\n\nAlan didn't say anything.\n\nGeorge looked an awful lot like Davey had, the day they killed him.\n\n#\n\nMimi found a spare blanket in the closet, reeking of mothballs and\nscarred with a few curdled cigarette burns, and she spread it out on the\nfloor and helped him lift Grant's body onto it and wind it tightly\naround him.\n\n\"What now?\" she said.\n\nHe looked down at the wound sheet, the lump within it. He sat down\nheavily on the bed. His chest was tight, and his breath came in short\n*hup*s.\n\nShe sat beside him and put an arm around his shoulder, tried to pull his\nhead down to her bosom, but he stiffened his neck.\n\n\"I knew this was coming,\" he said. \"When we killed Darren, I knew.\"\n\nShe stood and lit a cigarette. \"This is your family business,\" she said,\n\"why we're driving up north?\"\n\nHe nodded, not trusting his voice, seeing the outlines of Grad's face,\noutlined in moth-eaten blanket.\n\n\"So,\" she said. \"Let's get up north, then. Take an end.\"\n\nThe night was cold, and they staggered under the weight of the body\nwound in the blanket and laid him out in the trunk of the car, shifting\nluggage and picnic supplies to the back seat. At two a.m., the motel\nlights were out and the road was dark and silent but for the soughing of\nwind and the distant sounds of night animals.\n\n\"Are you okay to drive?\" she said, as she piled their clothes\nindiscriminately into the suitcases.\n\n\"What?\" he said. The cool air on his face was waking him up a little,\nbut he was still in a dream-universe. The air was spicy and outdoors and\nit reminded him powerfully of home and simpler times.\n\nHe looked at Mimi without really seeing her.\n\n\"Are you okay to drive?\"\n\nThe keys were in his hands, the car smelling of the detailing-in-a-can\nmist that the rental agency sprayed on the upholstery to get rid of the\ndiscount traveler farts between rentals.\n\n\"I can drive,\" he said. Home, and the mountain, and the washing machine,\nand the nook where he'd slept for 18 years, and the golems, and the\ncradle they'd hewn for him. Another ten or twelve hours' driving and\nthey'd be at the foot of the trail where the grass grew to waist-high.\n\n\"Well, then, *drive*.\" She got in the car and slammed her door.\n\nHe climbed in, started the engine, and put the hertzmobile into reverse.\n\n#\n\nTwo hours later, he realized that he was going to nod off. The thumps of\nthe body sliding in the trunk and the suitcases rattling around in the\nback seat had lost their power to keep him awake.\n\nThe body's thumping had hardly had the power to begin with. Once the\ninitial shock had passed, the body became an object only, a thing, a\npayload he had to deliver. Alan wondered if he was capable of feeling\nthe loss.\n\n\"You were eleven then,\" he said. It was suddenly as though no time had\npast since they'd sat on the bed and she'd told him about Auntie.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"It was as though no time had passed.\"\n\nA shiver went up his back.\n\nHe was wide awake.\n\n\"No time had passed.\"\n\n\"Yes. I was living with a nice family in Oakville who were sending me to\na nice girls' school where we wore blazers over our tunics, and I had a\npermanent note excusing me from gym classes. In a building full of four\nhundred girls going through puberty, one more fat shy girl who wouldn't\ntake her top off was hardly noteworthy.\"\n\n\"The family, they were nice. WASPy. They called me Cheryl. With a\nWhy. When I asked them where I'd been before, about 'Auntie,' they\nlooked sad and hurt and worried for me, and I learned to stop. They\nhugged me and touched my wings and never said anything -- and never\nwiped their hands on their pants after touching them. They gave me a\nroom with a computer and a CD player and a little TV of my own, and\nasked me to bring home my friends.\n\n\"I had none.\n\n\"But they found other girls who would come to my 'birthday' parties, on\nMay 1, which was exactly two months after their son's birthday and two\nmonths before their daughter's birthday.\n\n\"I can't remember any of their names.\n\n\"But they made me birthday cards and they made me breakfast and dinner\nand they made me welcome. I could watch them grilling burgers in the\nback yard by the above ground pool in the summer from my bedroom\nwindow. I could watch them building forts or freezing skating rinks in\nthe winter. I could listen to them eating dinner together while I did my\nhomework in my bedroom. There was a place for me at the dinner-table,\nbut I couldn't sit there, though I can't remember why.\"\n\n\"Wait a second,\" Alan said. \"You don't remember?\"\n\nShe made a sad noise in her throat. \"I was told I was welcome, but I\nknew I wasn't. I know that sounds paranoid -- crazy. Maybe I was just a\nteenager. There was a reason, though, I just don't know what it was. I\nknew then. They knew it, too -- no one blamed me. They loved me, I\nguess.\"\n\n\"You stayed with them until you went to school?\"\n\n\"Almost. Their daughter went to Waterloo, then the next year, their son\nwent to McGill in Montreal, and then it was just me and them. I had two\nmore years of high school, but it just got unbearable. With their\nchildren gone, they tried to take an interest in me. Tried to make me\neat with them. Take me out to meet their friends. Every day felt worse,\nmore wrong. One night, I went to a late movie by myself downtown and\nthen got to walking around near the clubs and looking at the club kids\nand feeling this terrible feeling of loneliness, and when I was finally\nready to go home, the last train had already gone. I just spent the\nnight out, wandering around, sitting in a back booth at Sneaky Dee's and\ndrinking Cokes, watching the sun come up from the top of Christie Pitts\noverlooking the baseball diamond. I was a 17-year-old girl from the\nsuburbs wearing a big coat and staring at her shoelaces, but no one\nbugged me.\n\n\"When I came home the next morning, no one seemed particularly bothered\nthat I'd been away all night. If anything, the parental people might\nhave been a little distraught that I came home. 'I think I'll get my own\nplace,' I said. They agreed, and agreed to put the lease in their name\nto make things easier. I got a crummy little basement in what the\nlandlord called Cabbagetown but what was really Regent Park, and I\nswitched out to a huge, anonymous high school to finish school. Worked\nin a restaurant at nights and on weekends to pay the bills.\"\n\nThe night highway rushed past them, quiet. She lit a cigarette and\nrolled down her window, letting in the white-noise crash of the wind and\nthe smell of the smoke mixed with the pine-and-summer reek of the\nroadside.\n\n\"Give me one of those,\" Alan said.\n\nShe lit another and put it between his lips, damp with her saliva. His\nskin came up in goosepimples.\n\n\"Who knows about your wings?\" he said.\n\n\"Krishna knows,\" she said. \"And you.\" She looked out into the\nnight. \"The family in Oakville. If I could remember where they lived,\nI'd look them up and ask them about it. Can't. Can't remember their\nnames or their faces. I remember the pool, though, and the barbecue.\"\n\n\"No one else knows?\"\n\n\"There was no one else before Krishna. No one that I remember, anyway.\"\n\n\"I have a brother,\" he said, then swallowed hard. \"I have a brother\nnamed Brad. He can see the future.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He pawed around for an ashtray and discovered that it had been\nremoved, along with the lighter, from the rental car's\ndashboard. Cursing, he pinched off the coal of the cigarette and flicked\nit to the roadside, hoping that it would burn out quickly, then he\ntossed the butt over his shoulder at the back seat. As he did, the body\nin the trunk rolled while he navigated a curve in the road and he braked\nhard, getting the car stopped in time for him to open the door and pitch\na rush of vomit onto the roadway.\n\n\"You okay to drive?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I am.\" He sat up and put the car into gear and inched to the\nshoulder, then put it in park and set his blinkers. The car smelled of\nsour food and sharp cigarettes and God, it smelled of the body in the\ntrunk.\n\n\"It's not easy to be precognizant,\" Alan said, and pulled back onto the\nroad, signaling even though there were no taillights or headlights for\nas far as the eye could see.\n\n\"I believe it,\" she said.\n\n\"He stopped telling us things after a while. It just got him into\ntrouble. I'd be studying for an exam and he'd look at me and shake his\nhead, slowly, sadly. Then I'd flunk out, and I'd be convinced that it\nwas him psyching me out. Or he'd get picked for kickball and he'd\nsay. 'What's the point, this team's gonna lose,' and wander off, and\nthey'd lose, and everyone would hate him. He couldn't tell the\ndifference between what he knew and what everyone else knew. Didn't know\nthe difference between the past and the future, sometimes. So he stopped\ntelling us, and when we figured out how to read it in his eyes, he\nstopped looking at us.\n\n\"Then something really -- Something terrible... Someone I cared about\ndied. And he didn't say anything about it. I could have -- stopped --\nit. Prevented it. I could have saved her life, but he wouldn't talk.\"\n\nHe drove.\n\n\"For real, he could see the future?\" she said softly. Her voice had more\nemotion than he'd ever heard in it and she rolled down the window and\nlit another cigarette, pluming smoke into the roar of the wind.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said. \"*A* future or *the* future, I never figured it\nout. A little of both, I suppose.\"\n\n\"He stopped talking, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I know what that's like,\" Mimi said. \"I hadn't spoken more than three\nwords in the six months before I met Krishna. I worked at a direct-mail\nhouse, proofreading the mailing labels. No one wanted to say anything to\nme, and I just wanted to disappear. It was soothing, in a way, reading\nall those names. I'd dropped out of school after Christmas break, just\ndidn't bother going back again, never paid my tuition. I threw away my\nhouseplants and flushed my fish down the toilet so that there wouldn't\nbe any living thing that depended on me.\"\n\nShe worked her hand between his thigh and the seat.\n\n\"Krishna sat next to me on the subway. I was leaning forward because my\nwings were long -- the longest they've ever been -- and wearing a big\nparka over them. He leaned forward to match me and tapped me on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"I turned to look at him and he said, 'I get off at the next stop. Will\nyou get off with me and have a cup of coffee? I've been riding next to\nyou on the subway for a month, and I want to find out what you're like.'\n\n\"I wouldn't have done it, except before I knew what I was doing, I'd\nalready said, 'I beg your pardon?' because I wasn't sure I'd heard him\nright. And once I'd said that, once I'd spoken, I couldn't bear the\nthought of not speaking again.\"\n\n#\n\nThey blew through Kapuskasing at ten a.m., on a grey morning that dawned\nwith drizzle and bad-tempered clouds low overhead. The little main drag\n-- which Alan remembered as a bustling center of commerce where he'd\nwaited out half a day to change buses -- was deserted, the only evidence\nof habitation the occasional car pulling through a donut store\ndrive-through lane.\n\n\"Jesus, who divorced me this time?\" Mimi said, ungumming her eyes and\nstuffing a fresh cigarette into her mouth.\n\n\"*Fear and Loathing* again, right?\"\n\n\"It's *the* road-trip novel,\" she said.\n\n\"What about *On the Road*?\"\n\n\"Oh, *that*,\" she said. \"Pfft. Kerouac was a Martian on crank. Dope\nfiend prose isn't fit for human consumption.\"\n\n\"Thompson isn't a dope fiend?\"\n\n\"No. That was just a put-on. He wrote *about* drugs, not *on* drugs.\"\n\n\"Have you *read* Kerouac?\"\n\n\"I couldn't get into it,\" she said.\n\nHe pulled sharply off the road and into a parking lot.\n\n\"What's this?\" she said.\n\n\"The library,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\n\nIt smelled just as it had when he was 17, standing among the aisles of\nthe biggest collection of books he'd ever seen. Sweet, dusty.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, crossing to the fiction section. The fiction section at\nthe library in town had fit into three spinner racks. Here, it occupied\nits own corner of overstuffed bookcases. \"Here,\" he said, running his\nfinger down the plastic Brodart wraps on the spines of the books, the\nfaded Dewey labels.\n\nH, I, J, K... There it was, the edition he'd remembered from all those\nyears ago. *On the Road.*\n\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"We've got it.\"\n\n\"You can't check that out,\" she said.\n\nHe pulled out his wallet as they drew up closer to the checkout\ncounter. He slid out the plastic ID holder, flipping past the health\ncard and the driver's license -- not a very good likeness of his face or\nhis name on either, and then produced a library card so tattered that it\nlooked like a pirate's map on parchment. He slid it delicately out of\nthe plastic sleeve, unbending the frayed corner, smoothing the feltlike\nsurface of the card, the furry type.\n\nHe slid the card and the book across the counter. Mimi and the librarian\n-- a boy of possibly Mimi's age, who wore a mesh-back cap just like his\npatrons, but at a certain angle that suggested urbane irony -- goggled\nat it, as though Alan had slapped down a museum piece.\n\nThe boy picked it up with such roughness that Alan flinched on behalf of\nhis card.\n\n\"This isn't --\" the boy began.\n\n\"It's a library card,\" Alan said. \"They used to let me use it here.\"\n\nThe boy set it down on the counter again.\n\nMimi peered at it. \"There's no name on that card,\" she said.\n\n\"Never needed one,\" he said.\n\nHe'd gotten the card from the sour-faced librarian back home, tricked\nher out of it by dragging along Bradley and encouraging him to waddle\noff into the shelves and start pulling down books. She'd rolled it into\nher typewriter and then they'd both gone chasing after Brad, then she'd\nasked him again for his name and they'd gone chasing after Brad, then\nfor his address, and then Brad again. Eventually, he was able to simply\nsnitch it out of the platen of the humming Selectric and walk out. No\none ever looked closely at it again -- not even the thoroughly\nprofessional staffers at the Kapuskasing branch who'd let him take out a\nstack of books to read in the bus station overnight while he waited for\nthe morning bus to Toronto.\n\nHe picked up the card again then set it down. It was the first piece of\nidentification he ever owned, and in some ways, the most important.\n\n\"I have to give you a new card,\" the mesh-back kid said. \"With a bar\ncode. We don't take that card anymore.\" He picked it up and made to tear\nit in half.\n\n\"NO!\" Alan roared, and lunged over the counter to seize the kid's\nwrists.\n\nThe kid startled back and reflexively tore at the card, but Alan's iron\ngrip on his wrists kept him from completing the motion. The kid dropped\nthe card and it fluttered to the carpet behind the counter.\n\n\"Give it to me,\" Alan said. The boy's eyes, wide with shock, began to\nscrew shut with pain. Alan let go his wrists, and the kid chafed them,\nbacking away another step.\n\nHis shout had drawn older librarians from receiving areas and offices\nbehind the counter, women with the look of persons accustomed to\nterminating children's mischief and ejecting rowdy drunks with equal\naplomb. One of them was talking into a phone, and two more were moving\ncautiously toward them, sizing them up.\n\n\"We should go,\" Mimi said.\n\n\"I need my library card,\" he said, and was as surprised as anyone at the\npout in his voice, a sound that was about six years old, stubborn, and\nwounded.\n\nMimi looked hard at him, then at the librarians converging on them, then\nat the mesh back kid, who had backed all the way up to a work surface\nseveral paces back of him. She planted her palms on the counter and\nswung one foot up onto it, vaulting herself over. Alan saw the back of\nher man's jacket bulge out behind her as her wings tried to spread when\nshe took to the air.\n\nShe snatched up the card, then planted her hands again and leapt into\nthe air. The toe of her trailing foot caught the edge of the counter and\nshe began to tumble, headed for a face-plant into the greyed-out\nindustrial carpet. Alan had the presence of mind to catch her, her tit\ncrashing into his head, and gentle her to the floor.\n\n\"We're going,\" Mimi said. \"Now.\"\n\nAlan hardly knew where he was anymore. The card was in Mimi's hand,\nthough, and he reached for it, making a keening noise deep in his\nthroat.\n\n\"Here,\" she said, handing it to him. When he touched the felted card\nstock, he snapped back to himself. \"Sorry,\" he said lamely to the\nmesh-back kid.\n\nMimi yanked his arm and they jumped into the car and he fumbled the key\ninto the ignition, fumbled the car to life. His head felt like a balloon\non the end of a taut string, floating some yards above his body.\n\nHe gunned the engine and the body rolled in the trunk. He'd forgotten\nabout it for a while in the library and now he remembered it\nagain. Maybe he felt something then, a twitchy twinge of grief, but he\nswallowed hard and it went away. The clunk-clunk of the wheels going\nover the curb as he missed the curb-cut back out onto the road, Mimi\nsucking breath in a hiss as he narrowly avoided getting T-boned by a\nrusted-out pickup truck, and then the hum of the road under his wheels.\n\n\"Alan?\" Mimi said.\n\n\"It was my first piece of identification,\" he said. \"It made me a person\nwho could get a book out of the library.\"\n\nThey drove on, heading for the city limits at a few klicks over the\nspeed limit. Fast, lots of green lights.\n\n\"What did I just say?\" Alan said.\n\n\"You said it was your first piece of ID,\" Mimi said. She was twitching\nworriedly in the passenger seat. Alan realized that she was air-driving,\nsteering and braking an invisible set of controls as he veered around\nthe traffic. \"You said it made you a person --\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Alan said. \"It did.\"\n\n#\n\nHe never understood how he came to be enrolled in kindergarten. Even in\nthose late days, there were still any number of nearby farm folk whose\nliteracy was so fragile that they could be intimidated out of it by a\nsheaf of school enrollment forms. Maybe that was it -- the five-year-old\nAlan turning up at the school with his oddly accented English and his\nMartian wardrobe of pieces rescued from roadside ditches and snitched\noff of clotheslines, and who was going to send him home on the first day\nof school? Surely the paperwork would get sorted out by the time the\nfirst permission-slip field trip rolled around, or possibly by the time\nvaccination forms were due. And then it just fell by the wayside.\n\nAlan got the rest of his brothers enrolled, taking their forms home and\nforging indecipherable scrawls that satisfied the office ladies. His own\nenrollment never came up in any serious way. Permission slips were easy,\ninoculations could be had at the walk-in clinic once a year at the fire\nhouse.\n\nUntil he was eight, being undocumented was no big deal. None of his\nclassmates carried ID. But his classmates *did* have Big Wheels,\ncatcher's mitts, Batmobiles, action figures, Fonzie lunchboxes, and\nKodiak boots. They had parents who came to parents' night and sent trays\nof cupcakes to class on birthdays -- Alan's birthday came during the\nsummer, by necessity, so that this wouldn't be an issue. So did his\nbrothers', when their time came to enroll.\n\nAt eight, he ducked show-and-tell religiously and skillfully, but one\nday he got caught out, empty-handed and with all the eyes in the room\nboring into him as he fumfuhed at the front of the classroom, and the\nteacher thought he was being kind by pointing out that his hand-stitched\nspring moccasins -- a tithe of the golems -- were fit subject for a\nbrief exposition.\n\n\"Did your mom buy you any real shoes?\" It was asked without malice or\ncalculation, but Alan's flustered, red-faced, hot stammer chummed the\nwaters and the class sharks were on him fast and hard. Previously\ninvisible, he was now the subject of relentless scrutiny. Previously an\nobserver of the playground, he was now a nexus of it, a place where\nattention focused, hunting out the out-of-place accent, the strange\nlunch, the odd looks and gaps in knowledge of the world. He thought he'd\nfigured out how to fit in, that he'd observed people to the point that\nhe could be one, but he was so wrong.\n\nThey watched him until Easter break, when school let out and they\ndisappeared back into the unknowable depths of their neat houses, and\nwhen they saw him on the street headed for a shop or moping on a bench,\nthey cocked their heads quizzically at him, as if to say, *Do I know you\nfrom somewhere?* or, if he was feeling generous, *I wonder where you\nlive?* The latter was scarier than the former.\n\nFor his part, he was heartsick that he turned out not to be half so\nclever as he'd fancied himself. There wasn't much money around the\nmountain that season -- the flakes he'd brought down to the assayer had\nbeen converted into cash for new shoes for the younger kids and\nchocolate bars that he'd brought to fill Bradley's little round belly.\n\nHe missed the school library achingly during that week, and it was that\nlack that drove him to the town library. He'd walked past the squat\nbrown brick building hundreds of times, but had never crossed its\nthreshold. He had a sense that he wasn't welcome there, that it was not\nintended for his consumption. He slunk in like a stray dog, hid himself\nin the back shelves, and read books at random while he observed the\nother patrons coming and going.\n\nIt took three days of this for him to arrive at his strategy for getting\nhis own library card, and the plan worked flawlessly. Bradley pulled the\nbooks off the back shelves for the final time, the librarian turned in\nexasperation for the final time, and he was off and out with the card in\nhis hand before the librarian had turned back again.\n\nCredentialed.\n\nHe'd read the word in a book of war stories.\n\nHe liked the sound of it.\n\n#\n\n\"What did Krishna do?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" She was looking at him guardedly now, but his\nmadness seemed to have past.\n\n\"I mean,\" he said, reaching over and taking her hand, \"what did Krishna\ndo when you went out for coffee with him?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. She was quiet while they drove a narrow road over a\nsteep hill. \"He made me laugh.\"\n\n\"He doesn't seem that funny,\" Alan said.\n\n\"We went out to this coffee shop in Little Italy, and he sat me down at\na tiny green metal table, even though it was still cold as hell, and he\nbrought out tiny cups of espresso and a little wax-paper bag of\nbiscotti. Then he watched the people and made little remarks about\nthem. 'She's a little old to be breeding,' or 'Oh, is that how they're\nwearing their eyebrow in the old country?' or 'Looks like he beats his\nwife with his slipper for not fixing his Kraft Dinner right.' And when\nhe said it, I *knew* it wasn't just a mean little remark, I *knew* it\nwas true. Somehow, he could look at these people and know what they were\nself-conscious about, what their fears were, what their little secrets\nwere. And he made me laugh, even though it didn't take long before I\nguessed that that meant that he might know my secret.\"\n\n\"So we drank our coffee,\" she said, and then stopped when the body\nthudded in the trunk again when they caught some air at the top of a\nhill. \"We drank it and he reached across the table and tickled my open\npalm with his fingertips and he said, 'Why did you come out with me?'\n\n\"And I mumbled and blushed and said something like, 'You look like a\nnice guy, it's just coffee, shit, don't make a big deal out of it,' and\nhe looked like I'd just canceled Christmas and said, 'Oh, well, too\nbad. I was hoping it was a big deal, that it was because you thought I'd\nbe a good guy to really hang out with a *lot*, if you know what I mean.'\nHe tickled my palm again. I was a blushing virgin, literally though I'd\nhad a couple boys maybe possibly flirt with me in school, I'd never\nreturned the signals, never could.\n\n\"I told him I didn't think I could be romantically involved with him,\nand he flattened out his palm so that my hand was pinned to the table\nunder it and he said, 'If it's your deformity, don't let that bother\nyou. I thought I could fix that for you.' I almost pretended I didn't\nknow what he meant, but I couldn't really, I knew he knew I knew. I\nsaid, 'How?' as in, *How did you know* and *How can you fix it*? but it\njust came out in a little squeak, and he grinned like Christmas was back\non and said, 'Does it really matter?'\n\n\"I told him it didn't, and then we went back to his place in Kensington\nMarket and he kissed me in the living room, then he took me upstairs to\nthe bathroom and took off my shirt and he --\"\n\n\"He cut you,\" Alan said.\n\n\"He fixed me,\" she said.\n\nAlan reached out and petted her wings through her jacket. \"Were you\nbroken?\"\n\n\"Of *course* I was,\" she snapped, pulling back. \"I couldn't *talk* to\npeople. I couldn't *do* anything. I wasn't a person,\" she said.\n\n\"Right,\" Alan said. \"I'm following you.\"\n\nShe looked glumly at the road unraveling before them, grey and hissing\nwith rain. \"Is it much farther?\" she said.\n\n\"An hour or so, if I remember right,\" he said.\n\n\"I know how stupid that sounds,\" she said. \"I couldn't figure out if he\nwas some kind of pervert who liked to cut or if he was some kind of\npervert who liked girls like me or if I was lucky or in trouble. But he\ncut them, and he gave me a towel to bite on the first time, but I never\nneeded it after that. He'd do it quick, and he kept the knife sharp, and\nI was able to be a person again -- to wear cute clothes and go where I\nwanted. It was like my life had started over again.\"\n\nThe hills loomed over the horizon now, low and rolling up toward the\nmountains. One of them was his. He sucked in a breath and the car\nwavered on the slick road. He pumped the brakes and coasted them to a\nstop on the shoulder.\n\n\"Is that it?\" she said.\n\n\"That's it,\" he said. He pointed. His father was green and craggy and\nsmaller than he remembered. The body rolled in the trunk. \"I feel --\" he\nsaid. \"We're taking him home, at least. And my father will know what to\ndo.\"\n\n\"No boy has ever taken me home to meet his folks,\" she said.\n\nAlan remembered the little fist in the dirt. \"You can wait in the car if\nyou want,\" he said.\n\n#\n\nKrishna came home,\n\n(she said, as they sat in the parked car at a wide spot in the highway,\nlooking at the mountains on the horizon)\n\nKrishna came home,\n\n(she said, after he'd pulled off the road abruptly, put the car into\npark, and stared emptily at the mountains ahead of them)\n\nKrishna came home,\n\n(she said, lighting a cigarette and rolling down the window and letting\nthe shush of the passing cars come fill the car, and she didn't look at\nhim, because the expression on his face was too terrible to behold)\n\nand he came through the door with two bags of groceries and a bottle of\nwine under one arm and two bags from a ravewear shop on Queen Street\nthat I'd walked past a hundred times but never gone into.\n\nHe'd left me in his apartment that morning, with his television and his\nbooks and his guitar, told me to make myself at home, told me to call in\nsick to work, told me to take a day for myself. I\nfelt...*glorious*. Gloried *in*. He'd been so attentive.\n\nHe'd touched me. No one had touched me in so long. No one had *ever*\ntouched me that way. He'd touched me with...*reverence*. He's gotten\nthis expression on his face like, like he was in *church* or\nsomething. He'd kept breathing something too low for me to hear and when\nhe put his lips right to my ear, I heard what he'd been saying all\nalong, \"Oh God, oh God, my God, oh God,\" and I'd felt a warmness like\nslow honey start in my toes and rise through me like sap to the roots of\nmy hair, so that I felt like I was saturated with something hot and\nsweet and delicious.\n\nHe came home that night with the makings of a huge dinner with boiled\nsoft-shell crabs, and a bottle of completely decent Chilean red, and\nthree dresses for me that I could never, ever wear. I tried to keep the\ndisappointment off my face as he pulled them out of the bag, because I\n*knew* they'd never go on over my wings, and they were *so* beautiful.\n\n\"This one will look really good on you,\" he said, holding up a Heidi\ndress with a scoop neck that was cut low across the back, and I felt a\nhot tear in the corner of my eye. I'd never wear that dress in front of\nanyone but him. I couldn't, my wings would stick out a mile.\n\nI knew what it meant to be different: It meant living in the second\nfloor with the old Russian Auntie, away from the crowds and their\neyes. I knew then what I was getting in for -- the rest of my life spent\nhidden away from the world, with only this man to see and speak to.\n\nI'd been out in the world for only a few years, and I had barely touched\nit, moving in silence and stealth, watching and not being seen, but oh,\nI had *loved it*, I realized. I'd thought I'd hated it, but I'd loved\nit. Loved the people and their dialogue and their clothes and their\nmysterious errands and the shops full of goods and every shopper hunting\nfor something for someone, every one of them part of a story that I\nwould never be part of, but I could be *next to* the stories and that\nwas enough.\n\nI was going to live in an attic again.\n\nI started to cry.\n\nHe came to me. he put his arms around me. He nuzzled my throat and\nlicked up the tears as they slid past my chin. \"Shhh,\" he said. \"Shhh.\"\n\nHe took off my jacket and my sweater, peeled down my jeans and my\npanties, and ran his fingertips over me, stroking me until I quietened.\n\nHe touched me reverently still, his breath hot on my skin. No one had\never touched me like that. He said, \"I can fix you.\"\n\nI said, \"No one can fix me.\"\n\nHe said, \"I can, but you'll have to be brave.\"\n\nI nodded slowly. I could do brave. He led me by the hand into the\nbathroom and he took a towel down off of the hook on the back of the\ndoor and folded it into a long strip. He handed it to me. \"Bite down on\nthis,\" he said, and helped me stand in the tub and face into the corner,\nto count the grid of tiles and the greenish mildew in the grout.\n\n\"Hold still and bite down,\" he said, and I heard the door close behind\nme. Reverent fingertips on my wing, unfolding it, holding it away from\nmy body.\n\n\"Be brave,\" he said. And then he cut off my wing.\n\nIt hurt so much, I pitched forward involuntarily and cracked my head\nagainst the tile. It hurt so much I bit through two thicknesses of\ntowel. It hurt so much my legs went to mush and I began to sit down\nquickly, like I was fainting.\n\nHe caught me, under my armpits, and held me up, and I felt something icy\npressed to where my wing had been -- I closed my eyes, but I heard the\nleathery thump as my wing hit the tile floor, a wet sound -- and gauzy\nfabric was wrapped around my chest, holding the icy towel in place over\nthe wound, once twice thrice, between my tits.\n\n\"Hold still,\" he said. And he cut off the other one.\n\nI screamed this time, because he brushed the wound he'd left the first\ntime, but I managed to stay upright and to not crack my head on\nanything. I felt myself crying but couldn't hear it, I couldn't hear\nanything, nothing except a high sound in my ears like a dog whistle.\n\nHe kissed my cheek after he'd wound a second bandage, holding a second\ncold compress over my second wound. \"You're a very brave girl,\" he\nsaid. \"Come on.\"\n\nHe led me into the living room, where he pulled the cushions off his\nsofa and opened it up to reveal a hide-a-bed. He helped me lie down on\nmy belly, and arranged pillows around me and under my head, so that I\nwas facing the TV.\n\n\"I got you movies,\" he said, and held up a stack of DVD rental boxes\nfrom Martian Signal. \"We got *Pretty in Pink*, *The Blues Brothers*,\n*The Princess Bride*, a Robin Williams stand-up tape and a really\nfunny-looking porno called *Edward Penishands*.\"\n\nI had to smile in spite of myself, in spite of the pain. He stepped into\nhis kitchenette and came back with a box of chocolates. \"Truffles,\" he\nsaid. \"So you can laze on the sofa, eating bonbons.\"\n\nI smiled more widely then.\n\n\"Such a beautiful smile,\" he said. \"Want a cup of coffee?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, choking it out past my raw-from-screaming throat.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Which video do you want to watch?\"\n\n\"*Princess Bride*,\" I said. I hadn't heard of any of them, but I didn't\nwant to admit it.\n\n\"You don't want to start with Edward Penishands?\"\n\n#\n\nAlan stood out front of the video shop for a while, watching Natalie\nwait on her customers. She was friendly without being perky, and it was\nclear that the mostly male clientele had a bit of a crush on her, as did\nher mooning, cow-eyed co-worker who was too distracted to efficiently\nshelve the videos he pulled from the box before him. Alan smiled. Hiring\ncute girls for your shop was tricky business. If they had brains, they'd\nsell the hell out of your stock and be entertaining as hell; but a lot\nof pretty girls (and boys!) had gotten a free ride in life and got\naffronted when you asked them to do any real work.\n\nNatalie was clearly efficient, and Alan knew that she wasn't afraid of\nhard work, but it was good to see her doing her thing, quickly and\nefficiently taking people's money, answering their questions, handing\nthem receipts, counting out change... He would have loved to have had\nsomeone like her working for him in one of his shops.\n\nOnce the little rush at the counter was cleared, he eased himself into\nthe shop. Natalie *was* working for him, of course, in the impromptu\nassembly line in Kurt's storefront. She'd proven herself to be as\nefficient at assembling and testing the access points as she was at\nrunning the till.\n\n\"Alan!\" she said, smiling broadly. Her co-worker turned and scowled\njealously at him. \"I'm going on break, okay?\" she said to him, ignoring\nhis sour puss.\n\n\"What, now?\" he said petulantly.\n\n\"No, I thought I'd wait until we got busy again,\" she said, not\nunkindly, and smiled at him. \"I'll be back in ten,\" she said.\n\nShe came around the counter with her cigs in one hand and her lighter in\nthe other. \"Coffee?\" she said.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said, and led her up the street.\n\n\"You liking the job?\" he said.\n\n\"It's better now,\" she said. \"I've been bringing home two or three\nmovies every night and watching them, just to get to know the stock, and\nI put on different things in the store, the kind of thing I'd never have\nwatched before. Old horror movies, tentacle porn, crappy kung-fu\nepics. So now they all bow to me.\"\n\n\"That's great,\" Alan said. \"And Kurt tells me you've been doing amazing\nwork with him, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's just fun,\" she said. \"I went along on a couple of dumpster\nruns with the gang. I found the most amazing cosmetics baskets at the\nShiseido dumpster. Never would have thought that I'd go in for that\ngirly stuff, but when you get it for free out of the trash, it feels\npretty macha. Smell,\" she said, tilting her head and stretching her\nneck.\n\nHe sniffed cautiously. \"Very macha,\" he said. He realized that the other\npatrons in the shop were eyeballing him, a middle-aged man, with his\nface buried in this alterna-girl's throat.\n\nHe remembered suddenly that he still hadn't put in a call to get her a\njob somewhere else, and was smitten with guilt. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Damn. I\nwas supposed to call Tropic\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1l and see about getting you a job. I'll do\nit right away.\" He pulled a little steno pad out of his pocket and\nstarted jotting down a note to himself.\n\nShe put her hand out. \"Oh, that's okay,\" she said. \"I really like this\njob. I've been looking up all my old high school friends: You were\nright, everyone I ever knew has an account with Martian Signal. God, you\nshould *see* the movies they rent.\"\n\n\"You keep that on file, huh?\"\n\n\"Sure, everything. It's creepy.\"\n\n\"Do you need that much info?\"\n\n\"Well, we need to know who took a tape out last if someone returns it\nand says that it's broken or recorded over or whatever --\"\n\n\"So you need, what, the last couple months' worth of rentals?\"\n\n\"Something like that. Maybe longer for the weirder tapes, they only get\nchecked out once a year or so --\"\n\n\"So maybe you keep the last two names associated with each tape?\"\n\n\"That'd work.\"\n\n\"You should do that.\"\n\nShe snorted and drank her coffee. \"I don't have any say in it.\"\n\n\"Tell your boss,\" he said. \"It's how good ideas happen in business --\npeople working at the cash register figure stuff out, and they tell\ntheir bosses.\"\n\n\"So I should just tell my boss that I think we should change our whole\nrental system because it's creepy?\"\n\n\"Damned right. Tell him it's creepy. You're keeping information you\ndon't need to keep, and paying to store it. You're keeping information\nthat cops or snoops or other people could take advantage of. And you're\nkeeping information that your customers almost certainly assume you're\nnot keeping. All of those are good reasons *not* to keep that\ninformation. Trust me on this one. Bosses love to hear suggestions from\npeople who work for them. It shows that you're engaged, paying attention\nto their business.\"\n\n\"God, now I feel guilty for snooping.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe you don't mention to your boss that you've been spending a\nlot of time looking through rental histories.\"\n\nShe laughed. God, he liked working with young people. \"So, why I'm\nhere,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I want to put an access point in the second-floor window and around\nback of the shop. Your boss owns the building, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I really don't think I can explain all this stuff to him --\"\n\n\"I don't need you to -- I just need you to introduce me to him. I'll do\nall the explaining.\"\n\nShe blushed a little. \"I don't know, Abe...\" She trailed off.\n\n\"Is that a problem?\"\n\n\"No. Yes. I don't know.\" She looked distressed.\n\nSuddenly he was at sea. He'd felt like he was in charge of this\ninteraction, like he understood what was going on. He'd carefully\nrehearsed what he was going to say and what Natalie was likely to say,\nand now she was, what, afraid to introduce him to her boss? Because why?\nBecause the boss was an ogre? Then she would have pushed back harder\nwhen he told her to talk to him about the rental records. Because she\nwas shy? Natalie wasn't shy. Because --\n\n\"I'll do it,\" she said. \"Sorry. I was being stupid. It's just -- you\ncome on a little strong sometimes. My boss, I get the feeling that he\ndoesn't like it when people come on strong with him.\"\n\nAh, he thought. She was nervous because he was so goddamned weird. Well,\nthere you had it. He couldn't even get sad about it. Story of his life,\nreally.\n\n\"Thanks for the tip,\" he said. \"What if I assure you that I'll come on\neasy?\"\n\nShe blushed. It had really been awkward for her, then. He felt\nbad. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Sure. Sorry, man --\"\n\nHe held up a hand. \"It's nothing.\"\n\nHe followed her back to the store and he bought a tin robot made out of\na Pepsi can by some artisan in Vietnam who'd endowed it with huge tin\ntesticles. It made him laugh. When he got home, he scanned and filed the\nreceipt, took a picture, and entered it into The Inventory, and by the\ntime he was done, he was feeling much better.\n\n#\n\nThey got into Kurt's car at five p.m., just as the sun was beginning to\nset. The sun hung on the horizon, *right* at eye level, for an eternity,\nslicing up their eyeballs and into their brains.\n\n\"Summer's coming on,\" Alan said.\n\n\"And we've barely got the Market covered,\" Kurt said. \"At this rate,\nit'll take ten years to cover the whole city.\"\n\nAlan shrugged. \"It's the journey, dude, not the destination -- the act\nof organizing all these people, of putting up the APs, of advancing the\nart. It's all worthwhile in and of itself.\"\n\nKurt shook his head. \"You want to eat Vietnamese?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I know a place,\" he said, and nudged the car through traffic and on to\nthe Don Valley Parkway.\n\n\"Where the hell are we *going*?\" Alan said, once they'd left the city\nlimits and entered the curved, identical cookie-cutter streets of the\nindustrial suburbs in the north end.\n\n\"Place I know,\" Kurt said. \"It's really cheap and really good. All the\nPeel Region cops eat there.\" He snapped his fingers. \"Oh, yeah, I was\ngoing to tell you about the cop,\" he said.\n\n\"You were,\" Alan said.\n\n\"So, one night I'd been diving there.\" Kurt pointed to an anonymous\nlow-slung, sprawling brown building. \"They print hockey cards, baseball\ncards, monster cards -- you name it.\"\n\nHe sipped at his donut-store coffee and then rolled down the window and\nspat it out. \"Shit, that was last night's coffee,\" he said. \"So, one\nnight I was diving there, and I found, I dunno, fifty, a hundred boxes\nof hockey cards. Slightly dented at the corners, in the trash. I mean,\nhockey cards are just *paper*, right? The only thing that makes them\nvaluable is the companies infusing them with marketing juju and glossy\npictures of mullet-head, no-tooth jocks.\"\n\n\"Tell me how you really feel,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Kurt said. \"The hockey players in junior high were real\njerks. I'm mentally scarred.\n\n\"So I'm driving away and the law pulls me over. The local cops, they\nknow me, mostly, 'cause I phone in B&Es when I spot them, but these guys\nhad never met me before. So they get me out of the car and I explain\nwhat I was doing, and I quote the part of the Trespass to Property Act\nthat says that I'm allowed to do what I'm doing, and then I open the\ntrunk and I show him, and he busts a *nut*: 'You mean you found these in\nthe *garbage?* My kid spends a fortune on these things! In the\n*garbage*?' He keeps saying, 'In the garbage?' and his partner leads him\naway and I put it behind me.\n\n\"But then a couple nights later, I go back and there's someone in the\ndumpster, up to his nipples in hockey cards.\"\n\n\"The cop,\" Alan said.\n\n\"The cop,\" Kurt said. \"Right.\"\n\n\"That's the story about the cop in the dumpster, huh?\" Alan said.\n\n\"That's the story. The moral is: We're all only a c-hair away from\njumping in the dumpster and getting down in it.\"\n\n\"C-hair? I thought you were trying not to be sexist?\"\n\n\"*C* stands for *cock*, okay?\"\n\nAlan grinned. He and Kurt hadn't had an evening chatting together in\nsome time. When Kurt suggested that they go for a ride, Alan had been\nreluctant: too much on his mind those days, too much *Danny* on his\nmind. But this was just what he needed. What they both needed.\n\n\"Okay,\" Alan said. \"We going to eat?\"\n\n\"We're going to eat,\" Kurt said. \"The Vietnamese place is just up\nahead. I once heard a guy there trying to speak Thai to the waiters. It\nwas amazing -- it was like he was a tourist even at home, an ugly\nfucked-up tourist. People suck.\"\n\n\"Do they?\" Alan said. \"I quite like them. You know, there's pretty good\nVietnamese in Chinatown.\"\n\n\"This is good Vietnamese.\"\n\n\"Better than Chinatown?\"\n\n\"Better situated,\" Kurt said. \"If you're going dumpster diving\nafterward. I'm gonna take your cherry, buddy.\" He clapped a hand on\nAlan's shoulder. Real people didn't touch Alan much. He didn't know if\nhe liked it.\n\n\"God,\" Alan said. \"This is so sudden.\" But he was happy about it. He'd\ntried to picture what Kurt actually *did* any number of times, but he\nwas never very successful. Now he was going to actually go out and jump\nin and out of the garbage. He wondered if he was dressed for it,\npicturing bags of stinky kitchen waste, and decided that he was willing\nto sacrifice his jeans and the old Gap shirt he'd bought one day after\nthe shirt he'd worn to the store -- the wind-up toy store? -- got soaked\nin a cloudburst.\n\nThe Vietnamese food was really good, and the family who ran the\nrestaurant greeted Kurt like an old friend. The place was crawling with\ncops, a new two or three every couple minutes, stopping by to grab a\nsalad roll or a sandwich or a go-cup of pho. \"Cops always know where to\neat fast and cheap and good,\" Kurt mumbled around a mouthful of pork\nchop and fried rice. \"That's how I found this place, all the cop cars in\nthe parking lot.\"\n\nAlan slurped up the last of his pho and chased down the remaining hunks\nof rare beef with his chopsticks and dipped them in chili sauce before\npopping them in his mouth. \"Where are we going?\" he asked.\n\nKurt jerked his head in the direction of the great outdoors. \"Wherever\nthe fates take us. I just drive until I get an itch and then I pull into\na parking lot and hit the dumpsters. There's enough dumpsters out this\nway, I could spend fifty or sixty hours going through them all, so I've\ngot to be selective. I know how each company's trash has been running --\nlots of good stuff or mostly crap -- lately, and I trust my intuition to\ntake me to the right places. I'd love to go to the Sega or Nintendo\ndumpsters, but they're like Stalag Thirteen -- razorwire and\nmotion-sensors and armed guards. They're the only companies that take\nsecrecy seriously.\" Suddenly he changed lanes and pulled up the driveway\nof an industrial complex.\n\n\"Spidey-sense is tingling,\" he said, as he killed his lights and crept\nforward to the dumpster. \"Ready to lose your virginity?\" he said,\nlighting a cigarette.\n\n\"I wish you'd stop using that metaphor,\" Alan said. \"Ick.\"\n\nBut Kurt was already out of the Buick, around the other side of the car,\npulling open Alan's door.\n\n\"That dumpster is full of cardboard,\" he said, gesturing. \"It's\nrecycling. That one is full of plastic bottles. More recycling. This\none,\" he said, *oof*ing as he levered himself over it, talking around\nthe maglight he'd clenched between his teeth, \"is where they put the\ngood stuff. Looky here.\"\n\nAlan tried to climb the dumpster's sticky walls, but couldn't get a\npurchase. Kurt, standing on something in the dumpster that crackled,\nreached down and grabbed him by the wrist and hoisted him up. He\nscrambled over the dumpster's transom and fell into it, expecting a wash\nof sour kitchen waste to break over him, and finding himself, instead,\namid hundreds of five-inch cardboard boxes.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked.\n\nKurt was picking up the boxes and shaking them, listening for the\nrattle. \"This place is an import\/export wholesaler. They throw out a lot\nof defective product, since it's cheaper than shipping it all back to\nTaiwan for service. But my kids will fix it and sell it on eBay. Here,\"\nhe said, opening a box and shaking something out, handing it to him. He\npassed his light over to Alan, who took it, unmindful of the drool on\nthe handle.\n\nIt was a rubber duckie. Alan turned it over and saw it had a hard chunk\nof metal growing out of its ass.\n\n\"More of these, huh?\" Kurt said. \"I found about a thousand of these last\nmonth. They're USB keychain drives, low-capacity, like 32MB. Plug them\nin and they show up on your desktop like a little hard drive. They light\nup in all kinds of different colors. The problem is, they've all got a\nmanufacturing defect that makes them glow in just one color -- whatever\nshade the little gel carousel gets stuck on.\n\n\"I've got a couple thousand of these back home, but they're selling\nbriskly. Go get me a couple cardboard boxes from that dumpster there and\nwe'll snag a couple hundred more.\"\n\nAlan gawped. The dumpster was seven feet cubed, the duckies a few inches\non a side. There were thousands and thousands of duckies in the\ndumpster: more than they could ever fit into the Buick. In a daze, he\nwent off and pulled some likely flattened boxes out of the trash and\nassembled them, packing them with the duckies that Kurt passed down to\nhim from atop his crunching, cracking mound of doomed duckies that he\nwas grinding underfoot.\n\nOnce they'd finished, Kurt fussed with moving the boxes around so that\neverything with a bootprint was shuffled to the bottom. \"We don't want\nthem to know that we've been here or they'll start hitting the duckies\nwith a hammer before they pitch 'em out.\"\n\nHe climbed into the car and pulled out a bottle of window cleaner and\nsome paper towels and wiped off the steering wheel and the dash and the\nhandle of his flashlight, then worked a blob of hand sanitizer into his\npalms, passing it to Alan when he was done.\n\nAlan didn't bother to point out that as Kurt had worked, he'd\ntransferred the flashlight from his mouth to his hands and back again a\ndozen times -- he thought he understood that this ritual was about Kurt\nassuring himself that he was not sinking down to the level of rummies\nand other garbage pickers.\n\nAs if reading his mind, Kurt said, \"You see those old rum-dums pushing a\nshopping cart filled with empty cans down Spadina? Fucking *morons* --\nthey could be out here pulling LCDs that they could turn around for ten\nbucks a pop, but instead they're rooting around like raccoons in the\ntrash, chasing after nickel deposits.\"\n\n\"But then what would you pick?\"\n\nKurt stared at him. \"You kidding me? Didn't you *see*? There's a hundred\ntimes more stuff than I could ever pull. Christ, if even one of them had\na squint of ambition, we could *double* the amount we save from the\ntrash.\"\n\n\"You're an extraordinary person,\" Alan said. He wasn't sure he meant it\nas a compliment. After all, wasn't *he* an extraordinary person, too?\n\n#\n\nAlan was stunned when they found a dozen hard drives that spun up and\nrevealed themselves to be of generous capacity and moreover stuffed with\nconfidential looking information when he plugged them into the laptop\nthat Kurt kept under the passenger seat.\n\nHe was floored when they turned up three slightly elderly Toshiba\nlaptops, each of which booted into a crufty old flavor of Windows, and\nonly one of which had any obvious material defects: a starred corner in\nits LCD.\n\nHe was delighted by the dumpsters full of plush toys, by the lightly\nused office furniture, by the technical books and the CDs of last year's\nsoftware. The smells were largely inoffensive -- Kurt mentioned that the\npicking was better in winter when the outdoors was one big fridge, but\nAlan could hardly smell anything except the sour smell of an old\ndumpster and occasionally a whiff of coffee grounds.\n\nThey took a break at the Vietnamese place for coconut ice and glasses of\nsweet iced coffee, and Kurt nodded at the cops in the restaurant. Alan\nwondered why Kurt was so pleasant with these cops out in the boonies but\nso hostile to the law in Kensington Market.\n\n\"How are we going to get connectivity out of the Market?\" Kurt said. \"I\nmean, all this work, and we've hardly gotten four or five square blocks\ncovered.\"\n\n\"Buck up,\" Alan said. \"We could spend another two years just helping\npeople in the Market use what we've installed, and it would still be\nproductive.\" Kurt's mouth opened, and Alan held his hand up. \"Not that\nI'm proposing that we do that. I just mean there's plenty of good that's\nbeen done so far. What we need is some publicity for it, some critical\nmass, and some way that we can get ordinary people involved. We can't\nfit a critical mass into your front room and put them to work.\"\n\n\"So what do we get them to do?\"\n\n\"It's a good question. There's something I saw online the other day I\nwanted to show you. Why don't we go home and get connected?\"\n\n\"There's still plenty of good diving out there. No need to go home\nanyway -- I know a place.\"\n\nThey drove off into a maze of cul-de-sacs and cheaply built, gaudy\nmonster homes with triple garages and sagging rain gutters. The streets\nhad no sidewalks and the inevitable basketball nets over every garage\nshowed no signs of use.\n\nKurt pulled them up in front of a house that was indistinguishable from\nthe others and took the laptop from under the Buick's seat, plugging it\ninto the cigarette lighter and flipping its lid.\n\n\"There's an open network here,\" Kurt said as he plugged in the wireless\ncard. He pointed at the dormer windows in the top room.\n\n\"How the hell did you find that?\" Alan said, looking at the darkened\nwindow. There was a chain-link gate at the side of the house, and in the\nback an aboveground pool.\n\nKurt laughed. \"These 'security consultants'\" -- he made little quotes\nwith his fingers -- \"wardrove Toronto. They went from one end of the\ncity to the other with a GPS and a wireless card and logged all the open\naccess points they found, then released a report claiming that all of\nthose access points represented ignorant consumers who were leaving\nthemselves vulnerable to attacks and making Internet connections\navailable to baby-eating terrorists.\n\n\"One of the access points they identified was *mine*, for chrissakes,\nand mine was open because I'm a crazy fucking anarchist, not because I'm\nan ignorant 'consumer' who doesn't know any better, and that got me to\nthinking that there were probably lots of people like me around, running\nopen APs. So one night I was out here diving and I *really* was trying\nto remember who'd played the Sundance Kid in Butch Cassidy, and I knew\nthat if I only had a net connection I could google it. I had a stumbler,\nan app that logged all the open WiFi access points that I came into\nrange of, and a GPS attachment that I'd dived that could interface with\nthe software that mapped the APs on a map of Toronto, so I could just\nbelt the machine in there on the passenger seat and go driving around\nuntil I had a list of all the wireless Internet that I could see from\nthe street.\n\n\"So I got kind of bored and went back to diving, and then I did what I\nusually do at the end of the night, I went driving around some\nresidential streets, just to see evidence of humanity after a night in\nthe garbage, and also because the people out here sometimes put out nice\nsofas and things.\n\n\"When I got home, I looked at my map and there were tons of access\npoints out by the industrial buildings, and some on the commercial\nstrips, and a few out here in the residential areas, but the one with\nthe best signal was right here, and when I clicked on it, I saw that the\nname of the network was 'ParasiteNet.'\"\n\nAlan said, \"Huh?\" because ParasiteNet was Kurt's name for his wireless\nproject, though they hadn't used it much since Alan got involved and\nthey'd gotten halfway legit. But still.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Kurt said. \"That's what I said -- huh? So I googled ParasiteNet\nto see what I could find, and I found an old message I'd posted to\ntoronto.talk.wireless when I was getting started out, a kind of\nmanifesto about what I planned to do, and Google had snarfed it up and\nthis guy, whoever he is, must have read it and decided to name his\nnetwork after it.\n\n\"So I figger: This guy *wants* to share packets with me, for sure, and\nso I always hunt down this AP when I want to get online.\"\n\n\"You've never met him, huh?\"\n\n\"Never. I'm always out here at two a.m. or so, and there's never a light\non. Keep meaning to come back around five some afternoon and ring the\nbell and say hello. Never got to it.\"\n\nAlan pursed his lips and watched Kurt prod at the keyboard.\n\n\"He's got a shitkicking net connection, though -- tell you what. Feels\nlike a T1, and the IP address comes off of an ISP in Waterloo. You need\na browser, right?\"\n\nAlan shook his head. \"You know, I can't even remember what it was I\nwanted to show you. There's some kind of idea kicking at me now,\nthough...\"\n\nKurt shifted his laptop to the back seat, mindful of the cords and the\nantenna. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Let's do some more driving around, let it perk, okay? You got more\ndumpsters you want to show me?\"\n\n\"Brother, I got dumpsters for weeks. Months. Years.\"\n\n#\n\nIt was the wardriving, of course. Alan called out the names of the\nnetworks that they passed as they passed them, watching the flags pop up\non the map of Toronto. They drove the streets all night, watched the sun\ngo up, and the flags multiplied on the network.\n\nAlan didn't even have to explain it to Kurt, who got it\nimmediately. They were close now, thinking together in the feverish\ndrive-time on the night-dark streets.\n\n\"Here's the thing,\" Kurt said as they drank their coffees at the Vesta\nLunch, a grimy 24-hour diner that Alan only seemed to visit during the\nsmallest hours of the morning. \"I started off thinking, well, the cell\ncompanies are screwed up because they think that they need to hose the\nwhole city from their high towers with their powerful transmitters, and\nmy little boxes will be lower-power and smarter and more realistic and\ngrassroots and democratic.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Alan said. \"I was just thinking of that. What could be more\ndemocratic than just encouraging people to use their own access points\nand their own Internet connections to bootstrap the city?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Sure, you won't get to realize your dream of getting a free Internet by\nbridging down at the big cage at 151 Front Street, but we can still play\naround with hardware. And convincing the people who *already* know why\nWiFi is cool to join up has got to be easier than convincing shopkeepers\nwho've never heard of wireless to let us put antennae and boxes on their\nwalls.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Kurt said, getting more excited. \"Right! I mean, it's just ego,\nright? Why do we need to *control* the network?\" He spun around on his\ncracked stool and the waitress gave him a dirty look. \"Gimme some apple\npie, please,\" he said. \"This is the best part: it's going to violate the\nhell out of everyone's contracts with their ISPs -- they sell you an\nall-you-can-eat Internet connection and then tell you that they'll cut\noff your service if you're too hungry. Well, fuck that! It's not just\ncommunity networking, it'll be civil disobedience against shitty\nservice-provider terms of service!\"\n\nThere were a couple early morning hard-hats in the diner who looked up\nfrom their yolky eggs to glare at him. Kurt spotted them and\nwaved. \"Sorry, boys. Ever get one of those ideas that's so good, you\ncan't help but do a little dance?\"\n\nOne of the hard-hats smiled. \"Yeah, but his wife always turns me down.\"\nHe socked the other hard-hat in the shoulder.\n\nThe other hard-hat grunted into his coffee. \"Nice. Very nice. You're\ngonna be a *lot* of fun today, I can tell.\"\n\nThey left the diner in a sleepdep haze and squinted into the sunrise and\ngrinned at each other and burped up eggs and sausages and bacon and\ncoffee and headed toward Kurt's Buick.\n\n\"Hang on,\" Alan said. \"Let's have a walk, okay?\" The city smelled like\nmorning, dew and grass and car-exhaust and baking bread and a whiff of\nthe distant Cadbury's factory oozing chocolate miasma over the hills and\nthe streetcar tracks. Around them, millions were stirring in their beds,\nclattering in their kitchens, passing water, and taking on vitamins. It\ninvigorated him, made him feel part of something huge and\nall-encompassing, like being in his father the mountain.\n\n\"Up there,\" Kurt said, pointing to a little playground atop the hill\nthat rose sharply up Dupont toward Christie, where a herd of plastic\nrocking horses swayed creakily in the breeze.\n\n\"Up there,\" Alan agreed, and they set off, kicking droplets of dew off\nthe grass beside the sidewalk.\n\nThe sunrise was a thousand times more striking from atop the climber,\nfiltered through the new shoots on the tree branches. Kurt lit a\ncigarette and blew plumes into the shafting light and they admired the\neffect of the wind whipping it away.\n\n\"I think this will work,\" Alan said. \"We'll do something splashy for the\npress, get a lot of people to change the names of their networks -- more\npeople will use the networks, more will create them... It's a good\nplan.\"\n\nKurt nodded. \"Yeah. We're smart guys.\"\n\nSomething smashed into Alan's head and bounced to the dirt below the\nclimber. A small, sharp rock. Alan reeled and tumbled from the climber,\nstunned, barely managing to twist to his side before landing. The air\nwhooshed out of his lungs and tears sprang into his eyes.\n\nGingerly, he touched his head. His fingers came away wet. Kurt was\nshouting something, but he couldn't hear it. Something moved in the\nbushes, moved into his line of sight. Moved deliberately into his line\nof sight.\n\nDanny. He had another rock in his hand and he wound up and pitched\nit. It hit Alan in the forehead and his head snapped back and he\ngrunted.\n\nKurt's feet landed in the dirt a few inches from his eyes, big boots\na-jangle with chains. Davey flitted out of the bushes and onto the\nplastic rocking-horses, jumping from the horse to the duck to the\nchicken, leaving the big springs beneath them to rock and creak. Kurt\ntook two steps toward him, but Davey was away, under the chain link\nfence and over the edge of the hill leading down to Dupont Street.\n\n\"You okay?\" Kurt said, crouching down beside him, putting a hand on his\nshoulder. \"Need a doctor?\"\n\n\"No doctors,\" Alan said. \"No doctors. I'll be okay.\"\n\nThey inched their way back to the car, the world spinning around\nthem. The hard-hats met them on the way out of the Vesta Lunch and their\neyes went to Alan's bloodied face. They looked away. Alan felt his\nkinship with the woken world around him slip away and knew he'd never be\ntruly a part of it.\n\n#\n\nHe wouldn't let Kurt walk him up the steps and put him to bed, so\ninstead Kurt watched from the curb until Alan went inside, then gunned\nthe engine and pulled away. It was still morning rush hour, and the\nMarket-dwellers were clacking toward work on hard leather shoes or\npiling their offspring into minivans.\n\nAlan washed the blood off his scalp and face and took a gingerly\nshower. When he turned off the water, he heard muffled sounds coming\nthrough the open windows. A wailing electric guitar. He went to the\nwindow and stuck his head out and saw Krishna sitting on an unmade bed\nin the unsoundproofed bedroom, in a grimy housecoat, guitar on his lap,\neyes closed, concentrating on the screams he was wringing from the\ninstrument's long neck.\n\nAlan wanted to sleep, but the noise and the throb of his head -- going\nin counterpoint -- and the sight of Davey, flicking from climber to bush\nto hillside, scuttling so quickly Alan was scarce sure he'd seen him, it\nall conspired to keep him awake.\n\nHe bought coffees at the Donut Time on College -- the Greek's wouldn't\nbe open for hours -- and brought it over to Kurt's storefront, but the\nlights were out, so he wandered slowly home, sucking back the coffee.\n\n#\n\nBenny had another seizure halfway up the mountain, stiffening up and\nfalling down before they could catch him.\n\nAs Billy lay supine in the dirt, Alan heard a distant howl, not like a\nwolf, but like a thing that a wolf had caught and is savaging with its\njaws. The sound made his neck prickle and when he looked at the little\nones, he saw that their eyes were rolling crazily.\n\n\"Got to get him home,\" Alan said, lifting Benny up with a grunt. The\nlittle ones tried to help, but they just got tangled up in Benny's long\nloose limbs and so Alan shooed them off, telling them to keep a lookout\nbehind him, look for Davey lurking on an outcropping or in a branch,\nrock held at the ready.\n\nWhen they came to the cave mouth again, he heard another one of the\nscreams. Brendan stirred over his shoulders and Alan set him down, heart\nthundering, looking every way for Davey, who had come back.\n\n\"He's gone away for the night,\" Burt said conversationally. He sat up\nand then gingerly got to his feet. \"He'll be back in the morning,\nthough.\"\n\nThe cave was destroyed. Alan's books, Ern-Felix-Grad's toys were\nsmashed. Their clothes were bubbling in the hot spring in rags and\ntatters. Brian's carvings were broken and smashed. Schoolbooks were\nruined.\n\n\"You all right?\" Alan said.\n\nBrian dusted himself off and stretched his arms and legs out. \"I'll be\nfine,\" he said. \"It's not me he's after.\"\n\nAlan stared blankly as the brothers tidied up the cave and made piles of\ntheir belongings. The little ones looked scared, without any of the\nhardness he remembered from that day when they'd fought it out on the\nhillside.\n\nBenny retreated to his perch, but before the sun set and the cave\ndarkened, he brought a couple blankets down and dropped them beside the\nnook where Alan slept. He had his baseball bat with him, and it made a\ngood, solid aluminum sound when he leaned it against the wall.\n\nSilently, the small ones crossed the cave with a pile of their own\nblankets, George bringing up the rear with a torn T-shirt stuffed with\nsharp stones.\n\nAlan looked at them and listened to the mountain breathe around them. It\nhad been years since his father had had anything to say to them. It had\nbeen years since their mother had done anything except wash the\nclothes. Was there a voice in the cave now? A wind? A smell?\n\nHe couldn't smell anything. He couldn't hear anything. Benny propped\nhimself up against the cave wall with a blanket around his shoulders and\nthe baseball bat held loose and ready between his knees.\n\nA smell then, on the wind. Sewage and sulfur. A stink of fear.\n\nAlan looked to his brothers, then he got up and left the cave without a\nlook back. He wasn't going to wait for Davey to come to him.\n\nThe night had come up warm, and the highway sounds down at the bottom of\nthe hill mingled with the spring breeze in the new buds on the trees and\nthe new needles on the pines, the small sounds of birds and bugs\nforaging in the new year. Alan slipped out the cave mouth and looked\naround into the twilight, hoping for a glimpse of something out of the\nordinary, but apart from an early owl and a handful of fireflies\nsparking off like distant stars, he saw nothing amiss.\n\nHe padded around the mountainside, stooped down low, stopping every few\nsteps to listen for footfalls. At the high, small entrance to the\ngolems' cave, he paused, lay on his belly, and slowly peered around the\nfissure.\n\nIt had been years since Alvin had come up to the golems' cave, years\nsince one had appeared in their father's cave. They had long ago ceased\nbringing their kills to the threshold of the boys' cave, ceased leaving\npelts in neat piles on the eve of the waning moon.\n\nThe view from the outcropping was stunning. The village had grown to a\ntown, fast on its way to being a city. A million lights twinkled. The\nhighway cut a glistening ribbon of streetlamps through the night, a\nstraight line slicing the hills and curves. There were thousands of\npeople down there, all connected by a humming net-work -- a work of\nnets, cunning knots tied in a cunning grid -- of wire and radio and\ncivilization.\n\nSlowly, he looked back into the golems' cave. He remembered it as being\nlined with ranks of bones, a barbarian cathedral whose arches were\ndecorated with ranked skulls and interlocked, tiny animal tibia. Now\nthose bones were scattered and broken, the ossified wainscoting rendered\ngap-toothed by missing and tumbled bones.\n\nAlan wondered how the golems had reacted when Darl had ruined their\ncenturies of careful work. Then, looking more closely, he realized that\nthe bones were dusty and grimed, cobwebbed and moldering. They'd been\nlying around for a lot longer than a couple hours.\n\nAlan crept into the cave now, eyes open, ears straining. Puffs of dust\nrose with his footfalls, illuminated in the moonlight and city light\nstreaming in from the cave mouth. Another set of feet had crossed this\nfloor: small, boyish feet that took slow, arthritic steps. They'd come\nin, circled the cave, and gone out again.\n\nAlan listened for the golems and heard nothing. He did his own slow\ncircle of the cave, peering into the shadows. Where had they gone?\n\nThere. A streak of red clay, leading to a mound. Alan drew up alongside\nof it and made out the runny outlines of the legs and arms, the torso\nand the head. The golem had dragged itself into this corner and had\nfallen to mud. The dust on the floor was red. Dried mud. Golem-dust.\n\nHow long since he'd been in this cave? How long since he'd come around\nthis side of the mountain? Two months. Three? Four? Longer. How long had\nthe golems lain dead and dust in this cave?\n\nThey'd carved his cradle. Fed him. Taught him to talk and to walk. In\nsome sense, they were his fathers, as much as the mountain was.\n\nHe fished around inside himself for emotion and found none. Relief,\nmaybe. Relief.\n\nThe golems were an embodiment of his strangeness, as weird as his\nsmooth, navelless belly, an element of his secret waiting to surface and\n-- what? What had he been afraid of? Contempt? Vivisection? He didn't\nknow anymore, but knew that he wanted to fit in and that the golems'\nabsence made that more possible.\n\nThere was a smell on the wind in here, the death and corruption smell\nhe'd noticed in the sleeping cave. Father was worried.\n\nNo. Davey was inside. That was his smell, the smell of Davey long dead\nand back from the grave.\n\nAlan walked deeper into the tunnels, following his nose.\n\n#\n\nDavey dropped down onto his shoulders from a ledge in an opening where\nthe ceiling stretched far over their heads. He was so light, at first\nAlan thought someone had thrown a blanket over his shoulders.\n\nThen the fingers dug into his eyes. Then the fingers fishhooked the\ncorner of his mouth.\n\nThen the screech, thick as a desiccated tongue, dry as the dust of a\ngolem, like no sound and like all the sounds at once.\n\nThe smell of corruption was everywhere, filling his nostrils like his\nface has been ground into a pile of rotten meat. He tugged at the dry,\nthin hands tangled in his face, and found them strong as iron bands, and\nthen he screamed.\n\nThen they were both screeching and rolling on the ground, and he had\nDanny's thumb in his hand, bending it back painfully, until *snap*, it\ncame off clean with a sound like dry wood cracking.\n\nDoug was off him then, crawling off toward the shadows. Alan got to his\nknees, still holding the thumb, and made ready to charge him, holding\nhis sore face with one hand, when he heard the slap of running footfalls\nbehind him and then Bill was streaking past him, baseball bat at ready,\nand he swung it like a polo-mallet and connected with a hollow crunch of\naluminum on chitinous leathery skin.\n\nThe sound shocked Alan to his feet, wet sick rising in his gorge. Benny\nwas winding up for a second blow, aiming for Darren's head this time, an\nout-of-the park *smack* that would have knocked that shrunken head off\nthe skinny, blackened neck, and Alan shouted, \"NO!\" and roared at Benny\nand leapt for him. As he sailed through the air, he thought he was\nsaving *Benny* from the feeling he'd carried with him for a decade, but\nas he connected with Benny, he felt a biting-down feeling, clean and\nhard, and he knew he was defending *Drew*, saving him for once instead\nof hurting him.\n\nHe was still holding on to the thumb, and Davey was inches from his\nface, and he was atop Benny, and they breathed together, chests\nheaving. Alan wobbled slowly to his feet and dropped the thumb onto\nDrew's chest, then he helped Billy to his feet and they limped off to\ntheir beds. Behind them, they heard the dry sounds of Davey getting to\nhis feet, coughing and hacking with a crunch of thin, cracked ribs.\n\n#\n\nHe was sitting on their mother the next morning. He was naked and\nunsexed by desiccation -- all the brothers, even little George, had\nceased going about in the nude when they'd passed through puberty --\nsullen and silent atop the white, chipped finish of her enamel top, so\nworn and ground down that it resembled a collection of beach-China. It\nhad been a long time since any of them had sought solace in their\nmother's gentle rocking, since, indeed, they had spared her a thought\nbeyond filling her belly with clothes and emptying her out an hour\nlater.\n\nThe little ones woke first and saw him, taking cover behind a\nstalagmite, peering around, each holding a sharp, flat rock, each with\nhis pockets full of more. Danny looked at each in turn with eyes gone\nyellow and congealed, and bared his mouthful of broken and blackened\nteeth in a rictus that was equal parts humor and threat.\n\nBradley was the next to wake, his bat in his hand and his eyelids\nfluttering open as he sprang to his feet, and then Alan was up as well,\na hand on his shoulder.\n\nHe crouched down and walked slowly to Davey. He had the knife, handle\nwound with cord, once-keen edge gone back to rust and still reddened\nwith ten-year-old blood, but its sharpness mattered less than its\nhistory.\n\n\"Welcome me home,\" Davey rasped as Alan drew closer. \"Welcome me home,\nmother*fucker*. Welcome me home, *brother*.\"\n\n\"You're welcome in this home,\" Alan said, but Davey wasn't welcome. Just\nlast week, Alan had seen a nice-looking bedroom set that he suspected he\ncould afford -- the golems had left him a goodly supply of gold flake,\nthough with the golems gone he supposed that the sacks were the end of\nthe family's no-longer-bottomless fortune. But with the bedroom set\nwould come a kitchen table, and then a bookcase, and a cooker and a\nfridge, and when they were ready, he could send each brother on his way\nwith the skills and socialization necessary to survive in the wide\nworld, to find women and love and raise families of their own. Then he\ncould go and find himself a skinny redheaded girl with a Scots accent,\nand in due time her belly would swell up and there would be a child.\n\nIt was all planned out, practically preordained, but now here they were,\nwith the embodied shame sitting on their mother, his torn thumb gleaming\nwith the wire he'd used to attach it back to his hand.\n\n\"That's very generous, *brother*,\" Danny said. \"You're a prince among\n*men*.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" Alan said. \"Breakfast in town. I'm buying.\"\n\nThey filed out and Alan spared Davey a look over his shoulder as they\nslipped away, head down on his knees, rocking in time with their mother.\n\n#\n\nKrishna grinned at him from the front porch as he staggered home from\nKurt's storefront. He was dressed in a hoodie and huge, outsized raver\npants that dangled with straps and reflectors meant to add kinetic\nreflections on the dance floor.\n\n\"Hello, neighbor,\" he said as Alan came up the walkway. \"Good evening?\"\n\nAlan stopped and put his hands on his hips, straightened his head out on\nhis neck so that he was standing tall. \"I understand what he gets out of\n*you*,\" Alan said. \"I understand that perfectly well. Who couldn't use a\nlittle servant and errand boy?\n\n\"But what I don't understand, what I can't understand, what I'd like to\nunderstand is: What can you get out of the arrangement?\"\n\nKrishna shrugged elaborately. \"I have no idea what you're talking\nabout.\"\n\n\"We had gold, in the old days. Is that what's bought you? Maybe you\nshould ask me for a counteroffer. I'm not poor.\"\n\n\"I'd never take a penny that *you* offered -- voluntarily.\" Krishna lit\na nonchalant cig and flicked the match toward his dry, xeroscaped\nlawn. There were little burnt patches among the wild grasses there, from\nother thrown matches, and that was one mystery-let solved, then, wasn't\nit?\n\n\"You think I'm a monster,\" Alan said.\n\nKrishna nodded. \"Yup. Not a scary monster, but a monster still.\"\n\nAlan nodded. \"Probably,\" he said. \"Probably I am. Not a human, maybe not\na person. Not a real person. But if I'm bad, he's a thousand times\nworse, you know. He's a scary monster.\"\n\nKrishna dragged at his cigarette.\n\n\"You know a lot of monsters, don't you?\" Alan said. He jerked his head\ntoward the house. \"You share a bed with one.\"\n\nKrishna narrowed his eyes. \"She's not scary, either.\"\n\n\"You cut off her wings, but it doesn't make her any less monstrous.\n\n\"One thing I can tell you, you're pretty special: Most real people never\nsee us. You saw me right off. It's like *Dracula*, where most of the\nhumans couldn't tell that there was a vampire in their midst.\"\n\n\"Van Helsing could tell,\" Krishna said. \"He hunted Dracula. You can't\nhunt what you can't see,\" he said. \"So your kind has been getting a safe\nfree ride for God-knows-how-long. Centuries. Living off of us. Passing\namong us. Passing for us.\"\n\n\"Van Helsing got killed,\" Alan said. \"Didn't he? And besides that, there\nwas someone else who could see the vampires: Renfield. The pathetic pet\nand errand boy. Remember Renfield in his cage in the asylum, eating\nflies? Trying to be a monster? Von Helsing recognized the monster, but\nso did Renfield.\"\n\n\"I'm no one's Renfield,\" Krishna said, and spat onto Alan's lawn. First\nfire, then water. He was leaving his mark on Alan's land, that was\ncertain.\n\n\"You're no Van Helsing, either,\" Alan said. \"What's the difference\nbetween you and a racist, Krishna? You call me a monster, why shouldn't\nI call you a paki?\"\n\nHe stiffened at the slur, and so did Alan. He'd never used the word\nbefore, but it had sprung readily from his lips, as though it had lurked\nthere all along, waiting to be uttered.\n\n\"Racists say that there's such a thing as 'races' within the human race,\nthat blacks and whites and Chinese and Indians are all members of\ndifferent 'races,'\" Krishna said. \"Which is bullshit. On the other hand,\nyou --\"\n\nHe broke off, left the thought to hang. He didn't need to finish\nit. Alan's hand went to his smooth belly, the spot where real people had\nnavels, old scarred remnants of their connections to real, human\nmothers.\n\n\"So you hate monsters, Krishna, all except for the ones you sleep with\nand the ones you work for?\"\n\n\"I don't work for anyone,\" he said. \"Except me.\"\n\nAlan said, \"I'm going to pour myself a glass of wine. Would you like\none?\"\n\nKrishna grinned hard and mirthless. \"Sure, neighbor, that sounds\nlovely.\"\n\nAlan went inside and took out two glasses, got a bottle of something\ncheap and serviceable from Niagara wine country out of the fridge,\nworked the corkscrew, all on automatic. His hands shook a little, so he\nheld them under the cold tap. Stuck to the wall over his work surface\nwas a magnetic bar, and stuck to it was a set of very sharp chef's\nknives that were each forged from a single piece of steel. He reached\nfor one and felt its comfort in his hand, seductive and glinting.\n\nIt was approximately the same size as the one he'd used on Davey, a\nknife that he'd held again and again, reached for in the night and\ncarried to breakfast for months. He was once robbed at knifepoint,\ntaking the deposit to the bank after Christmas rush, thousands of\ndollars in cash in a brown paper sack in his bag, and the mugger -- a\nsoft-spoken, middle-aged man in a good suit -- knew exactly what he was\ncarrying and where, must have been casing him for days.\n\nThe soft-spoken man had had a knife about this size, and when Alan had\nseen it pointed at him, it had been like an old friend, one whose orbit\nhad escaped his gravity years before, so long ago that he'd forgotten\nabout their tender camaraderie. It was all he could do not to reach out\nand take the knife from the man, say hello again and renew the\nfriendship.\n\nHe moved the knife back to the magnet bar and let the field tug it out\nof his fingers and *snap* it back to the wall, picked up the wine\nglasses, and stepped back out onto the porch. Krishna appeared not to\nhave stirred except to light a fresh cigarette.\n\n\"You spit in mine?\" Krishna said.\n\nThough their porches adjoined, Alan walked down his steps and crossed\nover the lawn next door, held the glass out to Krishna. He took it and\ntheir hands brushed each other, the way his hand had brushed the\nsoft-spoken man's hand when he'd handed over the sack of money. The\ntouch connected him to something human in a way that made him ashamed of\nhis desperation.\n\n\"I don't normally drink before noon,\" Adam said.\n\n\"I don't much care when I drink,\" Krishna said, and took a slug.\n\n\"Sounds like a dangerous philosophy for a bartender,\" Adam said.\n\n\"Why? Plenty of drunk bartenders. It's not a hard job.\" Krishna\nspat. \"Big club, all you're doing is uncapping beers and mixing shooters\nall night. I could do it in my sleep.\"\n\n\"You should quit,\" Alan said. \"You should get a better job. No one\nshould do a job he can do in his sleep.\"\n\nKrishna put a hand out on Alan's chest, the warmth of his fingertips\nradiating through Alan's windbreaker. \"Don't try to arrange me on your\nchessboard, monster. Maybe you can move Natalie around, and maybe you\ncan move around a bunch of Kensington no-hopers, and maybe you can budge\nmy idiot girlfriend a couple of squares, but I'm not on the board. I got\nmy job, and if I leave it, it'll be for me.\"\n\nAlan retreated to his porch and sipped his own wine. His mouth tasted\nlike it was full of blood still, a taste that was woken up by the\nwine. He set the glass down.\n\n\"I'm not playing chess with you,\" he said. \"I don't play games. I try to\nhelp -- I *do* help.\"\n\nKrishna swigged the glass empty. \"You wanna know what makes you a\nmonster, Alvin? That attitude right there. You don't understand a single\nfucking thing about real people, but you spend all your time rearranging\nthem on your board, and you tell them and you tell yourself that you're\nhelping.\n\n\"You know how you could help, man? You could crawl back under your rock\nand leave the people's world for people.\"\n\nSomething snapped in Alan. \"Canada for Canadians, right? Send 'em back\nwhere they came from, right?\" He stalked to the railing that divided\ntheir porches. The taste of blood stung his mouth.\n\nKrishna met him, moving swiftly to the railing as well, hood thrown\nback, eyes hard and glittering and stoned.\n\n\"You think you can make me feel like a racist, make me *guilty*?\" His\nvoice squeaked on the last syllable. \"Man, the only day I wouldn't piss\non you is if you were on fire, you fucking freak.\"\n\nSome part of Alan knew that this person was laughable, a Renfield eating\nbugs. But that voice of reason was too quiet to be heard over the animal\nscreech that was trying to work its way free of his throat.\n\nHe could smell Krishna, cigarettes and booze and club and sweat, see the\ngold flecks in his dark irises, the red limning of his eyelids. Krishna\nraised a hand as if to slap him, smirked when he flinched back.\n\nThen he grabbed Krishna's wrist and pulled hard, yanking the boy off his\nfeet, slamming his chest into the railing hard enough to shower dried\nspider's nests and flakes of paint to the porch floor.\n\n\"I'm every bit the monster my brother is,\" he hissed in Krishna's\near. \"I *made* him the monster he is. *Don't squirm*,\" he said, punching\nKrishna hard in the ear with his free hand. \"Listen. You can stay away\nfrom me and you can stay away from my family, or you can enter a world\nof terrible hurt. It's up to you. Nod if you understand.\"\n\nKrishna was still, except for a tremble. The moment stretched, and Alan\nbroke it by cracking him across the ear again.\n\n\"Nod if you understand, goddammit,\" he said, his vision going fuzzily\nblack at the edges. Krishna was silent, still, coiled. Any minute now,\nhe would struggle free and they'd be in a clinch.\n\nHe remembered kneeling on Davey's chest, holding the rock over him and\nrealizing that he didn't know what to do next, taking Davey to their\nfather.\n\nOnly Davey had struck him first. He'd only been restraining him,\ndefending himself. Alan had hit Krishna first. \"Nod if you understand,\nKrishna,\" he said, and heard a note of pleading in his voice.\n\nKrishna held still. Alan felt like an idiot, standing there, his\nneighbor laid out across the railing that divided their porches, the\nfirst cars of the day driving past and the first smells of bread and\nfish and hospital and pizza blending together there in the heart of the\nMarket.\n\nHe let go and Krishna straightened up, his eyes downcast. For a second,\nAlan harbored a germ of hope that he'd bested Krishna and so scared him\ninto leaving him alone.\n\nThen Krishna looked up and met his eye. His face was blank, his eyes\nlike brown marbles, heavy lidded, considering, not stoned at all\nanymore. Sizing Alan up, calculating the debt he'd just amassed, what it\nwould take to pay it off.\n\nHe picked up Alan's wine glass, and Alan saw that it wasn't one of the\ncheapies he'd bought a couple dozen of for an art show once, but rather\nIrish crystal that he'd found at a flea market in Hamilton, a complete\nfluke and one of his all-time miracle thrift scores.\n\nKrishna turned the glass one way and another in his hand, letting it\ncatch the sunrise, bend the light around the smudgy fingerprints. He set\nit down then, on the railing, balancing it carefully.\n\nHe took one step back, then a second, so that he was almost at the\ndoor. They stared at each other and then he took one, two running steps,\nlike a soccer player winding up for a penalty kick, and then he unwound,\nleg flying straight up, tip of his toe catching the wine glass so that\nit hurtled straight for Alan's forehead, moving like a bullet.\n\nAlan flinched and the glass hit the brick wall behind him,\ndisintegrating into a mist of glass fragments that rained down on his\nhair, down his collar, across the side of his face, in his ear. Krishna\nticked a one-fingered salute off his forehead, wheeled, and went back\ninto his house.\n\nThe taste of blood was in Alan's mouth. More blood coursed down his neck\nfrom a nick in his ear, and all around him on the porch, the glitter of\ncrystal.\n\nHe went inside to get a broom, but before he could clean up, he sat down\nfor a moment on the sofa to catch his breath. He fell instantly asleep\non the creaking horsehide, and when he woke again, it was dark and\nraining and someone else had cleaned up his porch.\n\n#\n\nThe mountain path had grown over with weeds and thistles and condoms and\ncans and inexplicable maxi-pads and doll parts.\n\nShe clung to his hand as he pushed through it, stepping in brackish\npuddles and tripping in sink holes. He navigated the trail like a\nmountain goat, while Mimi lagged behind, tugging his arm every time she\nmisstepped, jerking it painfully in its socket.\n\nHe turned to her, ready to snap, *Keep the fuck up, would you?* and then\nswallowed the words. Her eyes were red-rimmed and scared, her full lips\ndrawn down into a clown's frown, bracketed by deep lines won by other\nmoments of sorrow.\n\nHe helped her beside him and turned his back on the mountain, faced the\nroad and the town and the car with its trunk with its corpse with his\nbrother, and he put an arm around her shoulders, a brotherly arm, and\nhugged her to him.\n\n\"How're you doing there?\" he said, trying to make his voice light,\nthough it came out so leaden the words nearly thudded in the wet dirt as\nthey fell from his mouth.\n\nShe looked into the dirt at their feet and he took her chin and turned\nher face up so that she was looking into his eyes, and he kissed her\nforehead in a brotherly way, like an older brother coming home with a\nlong-lost sister.\n\n\"I used to want to know all the secrets,\" she said in the smallest\nvoice. \"I used to want to understand how the world worked. Little\nthings, like heavy stuff goes at the bottom of the laundry bag, or big\nthings, like the best way to get a boy to chase you is to ignore him, or\nmedium things, like if you cut an onion under running water, your eyes\nwon't sting, and if you wash your fingers afterward with lemon-juice\nthey won't stink.\n\n\"I used to want to know all the secrets, and every time I learned one, I\nfelt like I'd taken -- a step. On a journey. To a place. A destination:\nTo be the kind of person who knew all this stuff, the way everyone\naround me seemed to know all this stuff. I thought that once I knew\nenough secrets, I'd be like them.\n\n\"I don't want to learn secrets anymore, Andrew.\" She shrugged off his\narm and took a faltering step down the slope, back toward the road.\n\n\"I'll wait in the car, okay?\"\n\n\"Mimi,\" he said. He felt angry at her. How could she be so selfish as to\nhave a crisis *now*, *here*, at this place that meant so much to him?\n\n\"Mimi,\" he said, and swallowed his anger.\n\n#\n\nHis three brothers stayed on his sofa for a week, though they only left\none wet towel on the floor, only left one sticky plate in the sink, one\nfingerprint-smudged glass on the counter.\n\nHe'd just opened his first business, the junk shop -- not yet upscale\nenough to be called an antiques shop -- and he was pulling the kinds of\nlong hours known only to ER interns and entrepreneurs, showing up at 7\nto do the books, opening at 10, working until three, then turning things\nover to a minimum-wage kid for two hours while he drove to the city's\nthrift shops and picked for inventory, then working until eight to catch\nthe evening trade, then answering creditors and fighting with the\nlandlord until ten, staggering into bed at eleven to sleep a few hours\nbefore doing it all over again.\n\nSo he gave them a set of keys and bought them a MetroPass and stuffed an\nold wallet with $200 in twenties and wrote his phone number on the brim\nof a little pork pie hat that looked good on their head and turned them\nloose on the city.\n\nThe shop had all the difficulties of any shop -- snarky customers,\nshoplifting teenagers, breakage, idiots with jumpy dogs, never enough\nmoney and never enough time. He loved it. Every stinking minute of\nit. He'd never gone to bed happier and never woken up more full of\nenergy in his life. He was in the world, finally, at last.\n\nUntil his brothers arrived.\n\nHe took them to the store the first morning, showed them what he'd\nwrought with his own two hands. Thought that he'd inspire them to see\nwhat they could do when they entered the world as well, after they'd\ngone home and grown up a little. Which they would have to do very soon,\nas he reminded them at every chance, unmoved by George's hangdog\nexpression at the thought.\n\nThey'd walked around the shop slowly, picking things up, turning them\nover, having hilarious, embarrassing conversations about the likely\npurpose of an old Soloflex machine, a grubby pink Epilady leg razor, a\nBakelite coffee carafe.\n\nThe arguments went like this:\n\nGeorge: Look, it's a milk container!\n\nEd: I don't think that that's for milk.\n\nFred: You should put it down before you drop it, it looks valuable.\n\nGeorge: Why don't you think it's for milk? Look at the silver inside,\nthat's to reflect off the white milk and make it look, you know, cold\nand fresh.\n\nFred: Put it down, you're going to break it.\n\nGeorge: Fine, I'll put it down, but tell me, why don't you think it's\nfor milk?\n\nEd: Because it's a thermos container, and that's to keep hot stuff hot,\nand it's got a screwtop and whatever it's made of looks like it'd take a\nhard knock without breaking.\n\nAnd so on, nattering at each other like cave men puzzling over a\nwalkman, until Alan was called upon to settle the matter with the\nauthoritative answer.\n\nIt got so that he set his alarm for four a.m. so that he could sneak\npast their snoring form on the sofa and so avoid the awkward, desperate\npleas to let them come with him into the shop and cadge a free breakfast\nof poutine and eggs from the Harvey's next door while they were at\nit. George had taken up coffee on his second day in the city, bugging\nthe other two until they got him a cup, six or seven cups a day, so that\nthey flitted from place to place like a hummingbird, thrashed in their\nsleep, babbled when they spoke.\n\nIt came to a head on the third night, when they dropped by the shop\nwhile he was on the phone and ducked into the back room in order to\nseparate into threes again, with George wearing the pork pie hat even\nthough it was a size too big for his head and hung down around his ears.\n\nAdam was talking to a woman who'd come into the shop that afternoon and\ngreatly admired an institutional sofa from the mid-seventies whose lines\nbetrayed a pathetic slavish devotion to Danish Moderne aesthetics. The\nwoman had sat on the sofa, admired the sofa, walked around the sofa,\nhand trailing on its back, had been fascinated to see the provenance\nhe'd turned up, an inventory sticker from the University of Toronto\nmaintenance department indicating that this sofa had originally been\ninstalled at the Robarts Library, itself of great and glorious aesthetic\nobsolescence.\n\nHere was Adam on the phone with this woman, closing a deal to turn a\n$3,000 profit on an item he'd acquired at the Goodwill As-Is Center for\nfive bucks, and here were his brothers, in the store, angry about\nsomething, shouting at each other about something. They ran around like\nthree fat lunatics, reeking of the BO that they exuded like the ass end\nof a cow: Loud, boorish, and indescribably weird. Weird beyond the\nquaint weirdness of his little curiosity show. Weird beyond the\ninteresting weirdness of the punks and the goths and the mods who were\nwearing their subcultures like political affiliations as they strolled\nby the shops. Those were redeemable weirds, weirds within the bounds of\nnormal human endeavor. His brothers, on the other hand, were utterly,\nutterly irredeemable.\n\nHe sank down behind the counter as George said something to Fred in\ntheir own little shorthand language, a combination of grunts and\nnonsense syllables that the three had spoken together for so long that\nhe'd not even noticed it until they were taken out of their context and\nput in his. He put his back against the wall and brought his chest to\nhis knees and tried to sound like he had a belly button as he said to\nthe woman, \"Yes, absolutely, I can have this delivered tomorrow if you'd\nlike to courier over a check.\"\n\nThis check, it was enough money to keep his business afloat for another\n30 days, to pay his rent and pay the minimum-wage kid and buy his\ngroceries. And there were his brothers, and now Ed was barking like a\ndog -- a rare moment of mirth from him, who had been the sober outer\nbark since he was a child and rarely acted like the 17-year-old he was\nbehaving like today.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" she said down the phone, this woman who'd\nbeen smartly turned out in a cashmere sweater and a checked scarf and a\npair of boot-cut jeans that looked new and good over her designer shoes\nwith little heels. They'd flirted a little, even though she was at least\nten years older than him, because flirting was a new thing for Alan, and\nhe'd discovered that he wasn't bad at it.\n\n\"Everything is fine,\" he said. \"Just some goofballs out in the street\nout front. How about if I drop off the sofa for six o'clock?\"\n\n\"KILLED HER, CUT HER UP, SLICED HER OPEN,\" George screeched suddenly,\nskidding around the counter, rolling past him, yanking the phone out of\nthe wall.\n\nAnd in that moment, he realized what the sounds they had been making in\ntheir private speech had been: They had been a reenactment, a grunting,\nsqueaking playback of the day, the fateful day, the day he'd taken his\nknife and done his mischief with it.\n\nHe reached for the phone cable and plugged it back into the wall, but it\nwas as though his hand were moving of its own accord, because his\nattention was focused elsewhere, on the three of them arrayed in a\ntriangle, as they had been on the hillside, as they had been when they\nhad chanted at him when the knife grip was sure in the palm of his\nhands.\n\nThe ritual -- that's what it was, it was a *ritual* -- the ritual had\nthe feel of something worn smooth with countless repetitions. He found\nhimself rigid with shock, offended to his bones. This was what they did\nnow, in the cave, with Davey sitting atop their mother, black and\nshriveled, this was how they behaved, running through this reenactment\nof his great shame, of the day Danny died?\n\nNo wonder Darrel had terrorized them out of their home. They were beyond\nodd and eccentric, they were -- unfit. Unfit for polite company. For\nhuman society.\n\nThe phone in his hand rang. It was the woman.\n\n\"You know, I'm thinking that maybe I should come back in with a tape\nmeasure and measure up the sofa before I commit to it. It's a lot of\nmoney, and to be honest, I just don't know if I have room --\"\n\n\"What if I measure it for you? I could measure it for you and call you\nback with the numbers.\" The three brothers stared at him with identical\nglassy, alien stares.\n\n\"That's okay. I can come in,\" and he knew that she meant, *I won't ever\ncome in again.*\n\n\"What if I bring it by anyway? I could bring it by tomorrow night and\nyou could see it and make up your mind. No obligation.\"\n\n\"That's very kind of you, but I'm afraid that I'll be out tomorrow\nevening --\"\n\n\"Friday? I could come by Friday --\" He was trying to remember how to\nflirt now, but he couldn't. \"I could come by and we could have a glass\nof wine or something,\" and he knew he'd said the exact wrong thing.\n\n\"It's all right,\" she said coldly. \"I'll come by later in the week to\nhave another look.\n\n\"I have to go now, my husband is home,\" and he was pretty sure she\nwasn't married, but he said good bye and hung up the phone.\n\nHe looked at his solemn brothers now and they looked at him.\n\n\"When are you going home?\" he said, and Edward looked satisfied and Fred\nlooked a little disappointed and George looked like he wanted to throw\nhimself in front of a subway, and his bottom lip began to tremble.\n\n\"It was Ed's game,\" he said. \"The Davey game, it was his.\" He pointed a\nfinger. \"You know, I'm not like them. I can be on my own. I'm what\n*they* need, they're not what *I* need.\"\n\nThe other two stared at their fat bellies in the direction of their fat\nfeet. Andrew had never heard George say this, had never even suspected\nthat this thought lurked in his heart, but now that it was out on the\ntable, it seemed like a pretty obvious fact to have taken note of. All\nthings being equal, things weren't equal. He was cold and numb.\n\n\"That's a really terrible thing to say, George,\" is what he said.\n\n\"That's easy for you to say,\" is what George said. \"You are here, you\nare in the *world*. It's easy for you to say that we should be happy\nwith things the way they are.\"\n\nGeorge turned on his heel and put his head down and bulled out the door,\nslamming it behind him so that the mail slot rattled and the glass shook\nand a stack of nice melamine cafeteria trays fell off a shelf and\nclattered to the ground.\n\nHe didn't come back that night. He didn't come back the next day. Ed and\nFred held their grumbling tummies and chewed at the insides of their\nplump cheeks and sat on the unsold Danish Modern sofa in the shop and\nfreaked out the few customers that drifted in and then drifted out.\n\n\"This is worse than last time,\" Ed said, licking his lips and staring at\nthe donut that Albert refused to feel guilty about eating in front of\nthem.\n\n\"Last time?\" he said, not missing Felix's quick warning glare at Ed,\neven though Ed appeared to.\n\n\"He went away for a whole day, just disappeared into town. When he came\nback, he said that he'd needed some away time. That he'd had an amazing\nday on his own. That he wanted to come and see you and that he'd do it\nwhether we wanted to come or not.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Alvin said, understanding then how the three had come to be\nstaying with him. He wondered how long they'd last without the middle,\nwithout the ability to eat. He remembered holding the infant Eddie in\nhis arms, the boy light and hollowed out. He remembered holding the\nthree boys at once, heavy as a bowling ball. \"Ah,\" he said. \"I'll have\nto have a word with him.\"\n\n#\n\nWhen Greg came home, Alan was waiting for him, sitting on the sofa,\nholding his head up with one hand. Eli and Fred snored uneasily in his\nbed, breathing heavily through their noses.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said as he came through the door, scuffing at the lock with\nhis key for a minute or two first. He was rumpled and dirty, streaked\nwith grime on his jawline and hair hanging limp and greasy over his\nforehead.\n\n\"Greg,\" Alan said, nodding, straightening out his spine and listening to\nit pop.\n\n\"I'm back,\" George said, looking down at his sneakers, which squished\nwith grey water that oozed over his carpet. Art didn't say anything,\njust sat pat and waited, the way he did sometimes when con artists came\ninto the shop with some kind of scam that they wanted him to play along\nwith.\n\nIt worked the same with George. After a hard stare at his shoes, he\nshook his head and began to defend himself, revealing the things that he\nknew were indefensible. \"I had to do it, I just had to. I couldn't live\nin that cave, with that thing, anymore. I couldn't live inside those two\nanymore. I'm going crazy. There's a whole world out here and every day I\nget farther away from it. I get weirder. I just wanted to be normal.\n\n\"I just wanted to be like you.\n\n\"They stopped letting me into the clubs after I ran out of money, and\nthey kicked me out of the caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9s. I tried to ride the subway all night,\nbut they threw me off at the end of the line, so I ended up digging a\ntransfer out of a trash can and taking an all-night bus back downtown.\n\n\"No one looked at me twice that whole time, except to make sure that I\nwas gone. I walked back here from Eglinton.\"\n\nThat was five miles away, a good forty minute walk in the night and the\ncold and the dark. Greg pried off his sneakers with his toes and then\npulled off his grey, squelching socks. \"I couldn't find anyone who'd let\nme use the toilet,\" he said, and Alan saw the stain on his pants.\n\nHe stood up and took Greg by the cold hand, as he had when they were\nboth boys, and said, \"It's all right, Gord. We'll get you cleaned up and\nchanged and put you to bed, okay? Just put your stuff in the hamper in\nthe bathroom and I'll find you a change of clothes and make a couple\nsandwiches, all right?\"\n\nAnd just as easy as that, George's spirit was tamed. He came out of the\nshower pink and steaming and scrubbed, put on the sweats that Adam found\nfor him in an old gym bag, ate his sandwiches, and climbed into Adam's\nbed with his brothers. When he saw them again next, they were\nreassembled and downcast, though they ate the instant oatmeal with\nraisins and cream that he set out for them with gusto.\n\n\"I think a bus ticket home is about forty bucks, right?\" Alan said as he\npoured himself a coffee.\n\nThey looked up at him. Ed's eyes were grateful, his lips clamped shut.\n\n\"And you'll need some food on the road, another fifty or sixty bucks,\nokay?\"\n\nEd nodded and Adam set down a brown hundred-dollar bill, then put a\npurple ten on top of it. \"For the taxi to the Greyhound station,\" he\nadded.\n\n#\n\nThey finished their oatmeal in silence, while Adam puttered around the\napartment, stripping the cheese-smelling sheets and oily pillowcases off\nhis bed, rinsing the hairs off the soap, cleaning the toilet. Erasing\nthe signs of their stay.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at length. \"I should get going to the shop.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Ed said, in George's voice, and it cracked before he could close\nhis lips again.\n\n\"Right,\" Adam said. \"Well.\"\n\nThey patted their mouth and ran stubby fingers through their lank hair,\nalready thinning though they were still in their teens. They stood and\ncracked their knuckles against the table. They patted their pockets\nabsently, then pocketed the hundred and the ten.\n\n\"Well,\" Adam said.\n\nThey left, turning to give him the keys he'd had cut for them, a gesture\nthat left him feeling obscurely embarrassed and mean-spirited even\nthough -- he told himself -- he'd put them up and put up with them very\npatiently indeed.\n\nAnd then he left, and locked the door with his spare keys. Useless spare\nkeys. No one would ever come to stay with him again.\n\n#\n\nWhat I found in the cave,\n\n(he said, lying in the grass on the hillside, breathing hard, the taste\nof vomit sour in his mouth, his arms and legs sore from the pumping run\ndown the hillside)\n\nWhat I found in the cave,\n\n(he said, and she held his hand nervously, her fingers not sure of how\nhard to squeeze, whether to caress)\n\nWhat I found in the cave,\n\n(he said, and was glad that she hadn't come with him, hadn't been there\nfor what he'd seen and heard)\n\nWhat I found in the cave was the body of my first girlfriend. Her\nskeleton, polished to a gleam and laid out carefully on the floor. Her\nred hair in a long plait, brushed out and brittle, circled over her\nsmall skull like a halo.\n\nHe'd laid her out before my mother, and placed her fingernails at the\nexact tips of her fingerbones. The floor was dirty and littered with\nrags and trash. It was dark and it stank of shit, there were piles of\nshit here and there.\n\nThe places where my brothers had slept had been torn apart. My brother\nBradley, his nook was caved in. I moved some of the rocks, but I didn't\nfind him under there.\n\nBenny was gone. Craig was gone. Ed, Frankie, and George were gone. Even\nDavey was gone. All the parts of the cave that made it home were gone,\nexcept for my mother, who was rusted and sat askew on the uneven\nfloor. One of her feet had rusted through, and her generator had run\ndry, and she was silent and dry, with a humus-paste of leaves and guano\nand gunk sliming her basket.\n\nI went down to the cave where my father spoke to us, and I found that I\n-- I --\n\nI found that I couldn't see in the dark anymore. I'd never had a\nmoment's pause in the halls of my father, but now I walked falteringly,\nthe sounds of my footsteps not like the steps of a son of the mountain\nat all. I heard them echo back and they sounded like an outsider, and I\nfell twice and hurt my head, here --\n\n(he touched the goose egg he'd raised on his forehead)\n\nand I got dizzy, and then I was in the pool, but it didn't sound right\nand I couldn't hear it right, and I got my clothes off and then I stood\nthere with them in my arms --\n\n(his hand came back bloody and he wiped it absently on the grass and\nMimi took hold of it)\n\nBecause. If I put them down. It was dark. And I'd never find them\nagain. So I bundled them all up and carried them over my head and I\nwaded in and the water had never been so cold and had never felt so oily\nand there was a smell to it, a stagnant smell.\n\nI waded out and I stood and I shivered and I whispered, \"Father?\" and I\nlistened.\n\nI heard the sound of the water I'd disturbed, lapping around my ears and\nup on the shore. I smelled the sewage and oil smell, but none of the\nhabitual smells of my father: Clean water, coalface, sulfur, grass, and\nlime.\n\nI picked my way out of the water again and I walked to the shore, and it\nwas too dark to put on my clothes, so I carried them under one arm and\nfelt my way back to the summer cave and leaned against my mother and\nwaited to drip dry. I'd stepped in something soft that squished and\nsmelled between my mother and my father, and I didn't want to put on my\nsocks until I'd wiped it off, but I couldn't bring myself to wipe it on\nthe cave floor.\n\nMarci's eye sockets looked up at the ceiling. She'd been laid out with\nso much care, I couldn't believe that Davey had had anything to do with\nit. I thought that Benny must be around somewhere, looking in, taking\ncare.\n\nI closed my eyes so that I wasn't looking into the terrible,\nrecriminating stare, and I leaned my head up against my mother, and I\nbreathed until the stink got to me and then I pried myself upright and\nwalked out of the cave. I stopped and stood in the mouth of the cave and\nlistened as hard as I could, but my father wasn't speaking. And the\nsmell was getting to me.\n\n#\n\nShe got him dressed and she fed him sips of water and she got him\nstanding and walked him in circles around the little paddock he'd\ncollapsed in.\n\n\"I need to get Georgie out of the car,\" he said. \"I'm going to leave him\nin the cave. It's right.\"\n\nShe bit her lip and nodded slowly. \"I can help you with that,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't need help,\" he said lamely.\n\n\"I didn't say you did, but I can help anyway.\"\n\nThey walked down slowly, him leaning on her arm like an old man, steps\nfaltering in the scree on the slope. They came to the road and stood\nbefore the trunk as the cars whizzed past them. He opened the trunk and\nlooked down.\n\nThe journey hadn't been good to Gregg. He'd come undone from his winding\nsheet and lay face down, neck stiff, his nose mashed against the floor\nof the trunk. His skin had started to flake off, leaving a kind of scale\nor dandruff on the flat industrial upholstery inside the trunk.\n\nAlan gingerly tugged loose the sheet and began, awkwardly, to wrap it\naround his brother, ignoring the grit of shed skin and hair that clung\nto his fingers.\n\nMimi shook him by the shoulder hard, and he realized she'd been shaking\nhim for some time. \"You can't do that here,\" she said. \"Would you listen\nto me? You can't do that here. Someone will see.\" She held something\nup. His keys.\n\n\"I'll back it up to the trailhead,\" she said. \"Close the trunk and wait\nfor me there.\"\n\nShe got behind the wheel and he sloped off to the trailhead and stood,\nnumbly, holding the lump on his forehead and staring at a rusted Coke\ncan in a muddy puddle.\n\nShe backed the car up almost to his shins, put it in park, and came\naround to the trunk. She popped the lid and looked in and wrinkled her\nnose.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said. \"I'll get him covered and we'll carry him up the\nhill.\"\n\n\"Mimi --\" he began. \"Mimi, it's okay. You don't need to go in there for\nme. I know it's hard for you --\"\n\nShe squeezed his hand. \"I'm over it, Andy. Now that I know what's up\nthere, it's not scary any longer.\"\n\nHe watched her shoulders work, watched her wings work, as she wrapped up\nhis brother. When she was done, he took one end of the bundle and\nhoisted it, trying to ignore the rain of skin and hair that shook off\nover the bumper and his trousers.\n\n\"Up we go,\" she said, and moved to take the front. \"Tell me when to\nturn.\"\n\nThey had to set him down twice before they made it all the way up the\nhill. The first time, they just stood in silence, wiping their cramped\nhands on their thighs. The second time, she came to him and put her arm\naround his shoulders and gave him a soft kiss on the cheek that felt\nlike a feather.\n\n\"Almost there?\" she said.\n\nHe nodded and bent to pick up his end.\n\nMimi plunged through the cave mouth without a moment's hesitation and\nthey set him down just inside the entrance, near a pair of stained\ncotton Y-fronts.\n\nAlan waited for his heart to stop thudding and the sweat to cool on his\nbrow and then he kicked the underwear away as an afterthought.\n\n\"God,\" he said. She moved to him, put her arm around his shoulder.\n\n\"You're being brave,\" she said.\n\n\"God,\" he said again.\n\n\"Let it out, you know, if you want to.\"\n\nBut he didn't, he wanted to sit down. He moved to his mother's side and\nleaned against her.\n\nMimi sat on her hunkers before him and took his hand and tried to tilt\nhis chin up with one finger, but he resisted her pull and she rose and\nbegan to explore the cave. He heard her stop near Marci's skeleton for a\nlong while, then move some more. She circled him and his mother, then\nopened her lid and stared into her hamper. He wanted to tell her not to\ntouch his mother, but the words sounded ridiculous in his head and he\ndidn't dare find out how stupid they sounded moving through freespace.\n\nAnd then the washing machine bucked and made a snapping sound and hummed\nto life.\n\n*The generator's dead,* he thought. *And she's all rusted through.* And\n still the washing machine moved. He heard the gush of water filling\n her, a wet and muddy sound.\n\n\"What did you do?\" he asked. He climbed slowly to his feet, facing away\nfrom his mother, not wanting to see her terrible bucking as she wobbled\non her broken foot.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Mimi said. \"I just looked inside and it started up.\"\n\nHe stared at his mother, enraptured, mesmerized. Mimi stole alongside of\nhim and he noticed that she'd taken off her jacket and the sweatshirt,\nsplaying out her wings around her.\n\nHer hand found his and squeezed. The machine rocked. His mother rocked\nand gurgled and rushed, and then she found some local point of stability\nand settled into a soft rocking rhythm.\n\nThe rush of water echoed off the cave walls, a white-noise shushing that\nsounded like skis cutting through powder. It was a beautiful sound, one\nthat transported him to a million mornings spent waiting for the boys'\nlaundry to finish and be hung on the line.\n\n*All gone.*\n\nHe jerked his head up so fast that something in his neck cracked,\nneedling pain up into his temples and forehead. He looked at Mimi, but\nshe gave no sign of having heard the voice, the words, *All gone.*\n\n*All gone.*\n\nMimi looked at him and cocked her head. \"What?\" she said.\n\nHe touched her lips with a finger, forgetting to be mindful of the\nswelling there, and she flinched away. There was a rustle of wings and\nclothing.\n\n*My sons, all my sons, gone.*\n\nThe voice emerged from that white-noise roar of water humming and\nsloshing back and forth in her basket. Mimi squeezed his hand so hard he\nfelt the bones grate.\n\n\"Mom?\" he said softly, his voice cracking. He took half a step toward\nthe washer.\n\n*So tired. I'm worn out. I've been worn out.*\n\nHe touched the enamel on the lid of the washer, and felt the vibrations\nthrough his fingertips. \"I can -- I can take you home,\" he said. \"I'll\ntake care of you, in the city.\"\n\n*Too late.*\n\nThere was a snapping sound and then a front corner of the machine\nsettled heavily. One rusted out foot, broken clean off, rolled across\nthe cave floor.\n\nThe water sounds stilled.\n\nMimi breathed some words, something like Oh my God, but maybe in another\nlanguage, or maybe he'd just forgotten his own tongue.\n\n\"I need to go,\" he said.\n\n#\n\nThey stayed in a different motel on their way home from the mountain,\nand Mimi tried to cuddle him as he lay in the bed, but her wings got in\nthe way, and he edged over to his side until he was almost falling off\nbefore she took the hint and curled up on her side. He lay still until\nhe heard her snore softly, then rose and went and sat on the toilet,\nhead in his hands, staring at the moldy grout on the tiled floor in the\nwhite light, trying not to think of the bones, the hank of brittle red\nhair, tied tightly in a shopping bag in the trunk of the rental car.\n\nSunrise found him pacing the bathroom, waiting for Mimi to stir, and\nwhen she padded in and sat on the toilet, she wouldn't meet his eye. He\nfound himself thinking of her standing in the tub, rolled towel between\nher teeth, as Krishna approached her wings with his knife, and he went\nback into the room to dress.\n\n\"We going to eat breakfast?\" she asked in the smallest voice.\n\nHe said nothing, couldn't will himself to talk.\n\n\"There's still food in the car,\" she said after some silence had slipped\nby. \"We can eat that.\"\n\nAnd without any more words, they climbed into the car and he put the\npedal down, all the way to Toronto, stopping only once for gas and\ncigarettes after he smoked all the ones left in her pack.\n\nWhen they cleared the city limits and drove under the viaduct at\nDanforth Avenue, getting into the proper downtown, he eased off the\nParkway and into the city traffic, taking the main roads with their high\nbuildings and stoplights and people, people, people.\n\n\"We're going home?\" she said. The last thing she'd said was, \"Are you\nhungry?\" fourteen hours before and he'd only shook his head.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said.\n\nWas Krishna home? She was rooting in her purse now, and he knew that she\nwas looking for her knife.\n\n\"You staying with me?\" he said.\n\n\"Can I?\" she said. They were at a red light, so he looked into her\neyes. They were shiny and empty as marbles.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Of course. And I will have a word with Krishna.\"\n\nShe looked out the window. \"I expect he'll want to have a word with you,\ntoo.\"\n\n#\n\nLink rang his doorbell one morning while he was hunched over his\ncomputer, thinking about the story he was going to write. When he'd\nmoved into the house, he'd felt the shape of that story. All the while\nthat he'd sanded and screwed in bookcases, it had floated just below the\nsurface, its silhouette discernible through the ripples.\n\nBut when Adam left Mimi watching television and sat at his desk in the\nevening with the humming, unscuffed, and gleaming laptop before him,\nfingers poised over the keys, nothing came. He tapped out an opening\nsentence,\n\n\tI suspect that my father is dead\n\nand deleted it. Then undid the delete.\n\nHe called up The Inventory and stroked the spacebar with his thumb,\npaging through screensful of pictures and keywords and pricetags and\nscanned-in receipts. He flipped back to the story and deleted his\nsentence.\n\n\tMy dead brother had been hiding out on the synagogue's roof for\n\tGod knows how long.\n\nThe last thing he wanted was to write an autobiography. He wanted to\nwrite a story about the real world, about the real people who inhabited\nit. He hit the delete key.\n\n\tThe video-store girl never got bored behind her counter, because\n\tshe could always while away the hours looking up the rental\n\thistories of the popular girls who'd shunned her in high school.\n\nThat's when Link rang his doorbell and he startled guiltily and quit the\ntext editor, saving the opening sentence. Which had a lot of promise, he\nthought.\n\n\"Link!\" he said. \"Come in!\"\n\nThe kid had put on ten or fifteen pounds since they'd first met, and no\nlonger made Alan want to shout, *Someone administer a sandwich* stat*!*\nMost of it was muscle from hard riding as a bike messenger, a gig that\nLink had kept up right through the cold winter, dressing up like a\ngore-tex Martian in tights and ski goggles and a fleece that showed\nhints of purple beneath its skin of crusted road salt and pollution.\n\nAndrew had noticed the girls in the Market and at Kurt's shop noticing\nLink, whose spring wardrobe showed off all that new muscle to new\neffect, and gathered from the various hurt looks and sulks from the\nvarious girls that Link was getting more ass than a toilet-seat.\n\n\tHer brother spent the winter turning into the kind of stud that\n\tshe'd figured out how to avoid before she finished high school,\n\tand it pained her to see the hordes of dumb-bunnies making\n\tgoo-goo eyes at him.\n\nThat would be a good second sentence for his story.\n\n\"You okay, Abby?\" Link said, looking concerned. Albert realized that\nhe'd been on another planet for a moment there.\n\n\"Sorry, just fell down a rabbit hole,\" he said, flapping his arms\ncomically. \"I was writing \" -- felt *good* to say that -- \"and I'm in a\nbit of a, how you say, creative fog.\"\n\nLink took a step back. \"I don't want to disturb you,\" he said.\n\n\tBut for all that, she still approved his outfits before he left\n\tthe house, refusing to let him succumb to the ephemeral awful\n\ttrendiness of mesh-back caps and too-tight boy-scout jamboree\n\tshirts. Instead, she put him into slightly fitted cotton shirts\n\tthat emphasized his long lean belly and his broad shoulders.\n\n\"Don't sweat it. I could use a break. Come in and have a drink or\nsomething.\" He checked the yellowing face of the tick-tock clock he kept\non the mantelpiece and saw that it was just past noon. \"Past lunchtime,\nthat means that it's okay to crack a beer. You want a beer?\"\n\n\tAnd for all that, her brother still managed to come home looking\n\tlike some kind of frat-rat pussy-hound, the kind of boy she'd\n\talways hoped he wouldn't be.\n\n\"Beer would be great,\" Link said. He stepped into the cool of the living\nroom and blinked as his eyes adjusted. \"This really is a hell of a\nplace,\" he said, looking around at the glass cases, the teetering stacks\nof books that Andrew had pulled down and not reshelved, making ziggurats\nof them instead next to all the chairs.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" Adam said, handing him a glass of Upper Canada\nLager with a little wedge of lime. He'd bought a few cases of beer that\nweek and had been going through them steadily in the living room, paging\nthrough the most favored of his books, trying to find something, though\nhe wasn't sure what.\n\nLink sipped. \"Summer's here,\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Well, the thing is, summer. I'm going to be working longer hours and,\nyou know, evenings. Well. I mean. I'm 19 years old, Andy.\"\n\nAlan raised an eyebrow and sat back in his chair. \"What's the message\nyou're trying to convey to me, Link?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to be going around your friend's shop anymore. I really\nhad fun doing it all year, but I want to try something different with my\nspare time this summer, you understand?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Alan said. He'd had kids quit on him before. That's what kids\ndid. Attention spans.\n\n\"Right. And, well, you know: I never really understood what we were\n*doing*...\"\n\n\"Which part?\"\n\n\"The WiFi stuff --\"\n\n\"Well, you see --\"\n\n\"Stop, okay? I've heard you explain it ten times now and I still don't\nget it. Maybe after a semester or two of electrical engineering it'll\nmake more sense.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Adam said, smiling broadly to show no hard feelings. \"Hey,\" he\nsaid, carefully. \"If you didn't understand what we were doing, then why\ndid you do it?\"\n\nLink cocked his head, as if examining him for traces of sarcasm, then\nlooked away. \"I don't know. It was exciting, even if I didn't quite get\nit. Everyone else seemed to get it, sort of, and it was fun to work\nalongside of them, and sometimes the money was okay.\"\n\n\tWhich is why she decided to --\n\t\nDamn, what did she decide to do? That was shaping up to be a really good\nopener.\n\n\tWhich is why she wasn't surprised when he didn't come home for\n\tthree nights in a row.\n\nAha.\n\n\"No hard feelings, Link,\" Adam said. \"I'm really grateful for the help\nyou gave us and I hope you'll think about helping again in the fall...\"\n\n\tBut on the fourth night, she got worried, and she started\n\tcalling his friends. They were all poor students, so none of\n\tthem had land-line numbers you could look up in the phone book,\n\tbut that was okay, since they all had accounts with the video\n\tstore where she worked, with their deadbeat pre-paid mobile\n\tnumbers listed.\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds great, you know, September, it gets dark early. Just\ngot word that I got into Ryerson for the fall, so I'll be taking\nengineering classes. Maybe I can help out that way?\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" Alan said. Link took a step backward, drained his beer, held\nout the glass.\n\n\"Well, thanks,\" Link said, and turned. Alan reached past him and opened\nthe door. There were a couple of girls there, little suburban girls of\nthe type that you could find by the hatful in the Market on Saturday\nmornings, shopping for crazy clothes at the vintage shops. They looked\n14, but might have been as old as 16 or 17 and just heartbreakingly\nnaive. Link looked over his shoulder and had the decency to look\nslightly embarrassed as they smiled at him.\n\n\"Okay, thanks, then,\" he said, and one of the girls looked past him to\nget a glimpse inside the house. Andy instinctively stepped aside to give\nher a better view of his showroom and he was about to offer her a soda\nbefore he caught himself.\n\n\"You've got a nice place,\" she said. \"Look at all those books!\"\n\nHer friend said, \"Have you read all those books?\" She was wearing thick\nconcealer over her acne, but she had a round face and heart-shaped lips\nthat he wouldn't have been surprised to see on the cover of a\nmagazine. She said it with a kind of sneer.\n\nLink said, \"Are you kidding? What's the point of a houseful of books\nyou've already read?\"\n\nThey both laughed adoringly -- if Adam was feeling uncharitable, he'd\nsay it was simpering, not laughing, and took off for the exciting\nthrongs in the Market.\n\nAlan watched them go, with Link's empty glass in one hand and his full\nglass in the other. It was hot out in the Market, sunny, and it felt\nlike the spring had rushed up on him and taken him by surprise when he\nwasn't looking. He had owned the house for more than a year now, and the\nstory only had three or four paragraphs to it (and none of them were\nwritten down yet!).\n\n\t\"You can't wash shit,\" is what her mother said when she called\n\thome and asked what she should do about her brother. \"That kid's\n\tbeen a screw-up since he was five years old.\"\n\nHe should write the story down. He went back upstairs and sat down at\nthe keyboard and pecked out the sentences that had come to him, but they\nseemed very sterile there aglow on the screen, in just the same way that\nthey'd felt restless and alive a moment before. The sunny day beamed\nthrough the study window and put a glare up on his screen that made it\nhard to type, and when he moved to the other side of the desk, he found\nhimself looking out the window at the city and the spring.\n\nHe checked his calendar and his watch and saw that he only had a couple\nhours before the reporter from NOW magazine came by. The reporter -- a\nsummer intern -- was the only person to respond to his all-fluff press\nrelease on the open network. He and Kurt had argued about the wording\nall night and when he was done, he almost pitched it out, as the\neditorial thrash had gutted it to the point of meaninglessness.\n\nOh well. The breeze made the new leaves in the trees across the street\nsway, and now the sun was in his eyes, and the sentences were inert on\nthe screen.\n\nHe closed the lid of the laptop and grabbed his coat and left the house\nas fast as he could, obscurely worried that if he didn't leave then, he\nwouldn't get out all day.\n\n#\n\nAs he got closer to Kurt's storefront, he slowed down. The crowds were\nthick, laughing suburban kids and old men in buttoned-up cardigans and\nfisherman's caps and subcultural tropical fish of all kinds: Goths and\npunks and six kinds of ravers and hippies and so forth.\n\nHe spied Link sitting on the steps leading up to one of the above-shop\napartments, passing a cigarette to a little girl who sat between his\nknees. Link didn't see him, he was laughing at something the boy behind\nhim said. Alan looked closer. It was Krishna, except he'd shaved his\nhead and was wearing a hoodie with glittering piping run along the\ndouble seams, a kind of future-sarcastic raver jumper that looked like\nit had been abandoned on the set of *Space: 1999*.\n\nKrishna had his own little girl between *his* knees, with heart-shaped\nlips and thick matte concealer over her zits. His hand lay casually on\nher shoulder, and she brushed her cheek against it.\n\nAlan felt the air whuff out of him as though he'd been punched in the\nstomach, and he leaned up against the side of a fruit market, flattening\nhimself there. He turned his head from side to side, expecting to see\nMimi, and wanting to rush out and shield her from the sight, but she was\nnowhere to be seen, and anyway, what business was it of his?\n\nAnd then he spied Natalie, standing at the other end of the street,\nholding on to the handles of one of the show bicycles out front of Bikes\non Wheels. She was watching her brother closely, with narrowed eyes.\n\n\tIt was her fault, in some way. Or at least she thought it\n\twas. She'd caught him looking at Internet porn and laughed at\n\thim, humiliating him, telling him he should get out and find a\n\tgirl whose last name wasn't \"Jpeg.\"\n\nHe saw that her hands were clenched into fists and realized that his\nwere, too.\n\n\tIt was her fault in some way, because she'd seen the kind of\n\tperson he was hanging out with and she hadn't done a thing about\n\tit.\n\nHe moved into the crowd and waded through it, up the street on the\nopposite side from his neighbors. He closed in on Natalie and ended up\nright in front of her before she noticed he was there.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, and blushed hard. She'd been growing out her hair for a\ncouple months and it was long enough to clip a couple of barrettes\nto. With the hair, she looked less skinny, a little older, a little less\nvulnerable. She tugged at a hank of it absently. \"Hi.\"\n\n\"We going to do anything about that?\" he said, jerking his head toward\nthe steps. Krishna had his hand down the little girl's top now, cupping\nher breast, then laughing when she slapped it away.\n\nShe shrugged, bit her lip. She shook her head angrily. \"None of my\nbusiness. None of *your* business.\"\n\nShe looked at her feet. \"Look, there's a thing I've been meaning to tell\nyou. I don't think I can keep on volunteering at the shop, okay? I've\ngot stuff to do, assignments, and I'm taking some extra shifts at the\nstore --\"\n\nHe held up a hand. \"I'm grateful for all the work you've done,\nNatalie. You don't need to apologize.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" she said. She looked indecisively around, then seemed to make up\nher mind and she hugged him hard. \"Take care of yourself, okay?\"\n\nIt struck him as funny. \"I can take care of myself just fine, don't\nworry about me for a second. You still looking for fashion work? I think\nTropic\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1l will be hiring for the summer. I could put in that phone-call.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"No, that's okay.\" She looked over his shoulder and her\neyes widened. He turned around and saw that Krishna and Link had spotted\nthem, and that Krishna was whispering something in Link's ear that was\nmaking Link grin nastily.\n\n\"I should go,\" she said. Krishna's hand was still down the little girl's\ntop, and he jiggled her breast at Alan.\n\n#\n\nThe reporter had two lip piercings, and a matt of close-cropped\nmicro-dreads, and an attitude.\n\n\"So here's what I don't get. You've got the Market wired --\"\n\n\"Unwired,\" Kurt said, breaking in for the tenth time in as many\nminutes. Alan shot him a dirty look.\n\n\"Unwired, right.\" The kid made little inverted commas with his\nfingertips, miming, *Yes, that is a very cute jargon you've invented,\ndork.* \"You've got the Market unwired and you're going to connect up\nyour network with the big interchange down on Front Street.\"\n\n\"Well, *eventually*,\" Alan said. The story was too complicated. Front\nStreet, the Market, open networks...it had no focus, it wasn't a\ncomplete narrative with a beginning, middle, and end. He'd tried to\nexplain it to Mimi that morning, over omelets in his kitchen, and she'd\nbeen totally lost.\n\n\"Eventually?\" The kid took on a look of intense, teenaged skepticism. He\nclaimed to be 20, but he looked about 17 and had been the puck in an\nintense game of eyeball hockey among the cute little punk girls who'd\nbeen volunteering in the shopfront when he'd appeared.\n\n\"That's the end-goal, a citywide network with all-we-can eat free\nconnectivity, fully anonymized and hardened against malicious attackers\nand incidental environmental interference.\" Alan steepled his fingers\nand tried to look serious and committed.\n\n\"Okay, that's the goal.\"\n\n\"But it's not going to be all or nothing. We want to make the community\na part of the network. Getting people energized about participating in\nthe network is as important as providing the network itself -- hell, the\nnetwork *is* people. So we've got this intermediate step, this way that\neveryone can pitch in.\"\n\n\"And that is, what, renaming your network to ParasiteNet?\"\n\nKurt nodded vigorously. \"Zactly.\"\n\n\"And how will I find these ParasiteNet nodes? Will there be a map or\nsomething with all this information on it?\"\n\nAlan nodded slowly. \"We've been thinking about a mapping application --\"\n\n\"But we decided that it was stupid,\" Kurt said. \"No one needed to draw a\nmap of the Web -- it just grew and people found its weird corners on\ntheir own. Networks don't *need* centralized authority, that's just the\nchains on your mind talking --\"\n\n\"The chains on my mind?\" The kid snorted.\n\nAlan held his hands up placatingly. \"Wait a second,\" he said. \"Let's\ntake a step back here and talk about *values*. The project here is about\nfree expression and cooperation. Sure, it'd be nice to have a city-wide\nnetwork, but in my opinion, it's a lot more important to have a city\nfull of people working on that network because they value expression and\nunderstand how cooperation gets us more of that.\"\n\n\"And we'll get this free expression how?\"\n\n\"By giving everyone free Internet access.\"\n\nThe kid laughed and shook his head. \"That's a weird kind of 'free,' if\nyou don't mind my saying so.\" He flipped over his phone. \"I mean, it's\nlike, 'Free speech if you can afford a two-thousand-dollar laptop and\nwant to sit down and type on it.'\"\n\n\"I can build you a desktop out of garbage for twenty bucks,\" Kurt\nsaid. \"We're drowning in PC parts.\"\n\n\"Sure, whatever. But what kind of free expression is that? Free\nexpression so long as you're sitting at home with your PC plugged into\nthe wall?\"\n\n\"Well, it's not like we're talking about displacing all the other kinds\nof expression,\" Alan said. \"This is in addition to all the ways you've\nhad to talk --\"\n\n\"Right, like this thing,\" the kid said. He reached into his pocket and\ntook out a small phone. \"This was free -- not twenty dollars, not even\ntwo thousand dollars -- just free, from the phone company, in exchange\nfor a one-year contract. Everyone's got one of these. I went trekking in\nIndia, you see people using these out in the bush. And you know what\nthey use them for? Speech! Not speech-in-quotes meaning some kind of\nabstract expression, but actual *talking.*\"\n\nThe kid leaned forward and planted his hands on his knees and suddenly\nhe was a lot harder to dismiss as some subculture-addled intern. He had\nthat fiery intensity that Alan recognized from himself, from Kurt, from\nthe people who believe.\n\nAlan thought he was getting an inkling into why this particular intern\nhad responded to his press release: Not because he was too ignorant to\nsee through the bullshit, but just the opposite.\n\n\"But that's communication through the *phone company*,\" Kurt said,\nwonderment in his voice that his fellow bohemian couldn't see how\nsucktastic that proposition was. \"How is that free speech?\"\n\nThe kid rolled his eyes. \"Come off it. You old people, you turn up your\nnoses whenever someone ten years younger than you points out that cell\nphones are actually a pretty good way for people to communicate with\neach other -- even subversively. I wrote a term paper last year on this\nstuff: In Kenya, electoral scrutineers follow the ballot boxes from the\npolling place to the counting house and use their cell phones to sound\nthe alarm when someone tries to screw with them. In the Philippines,\ntwenty thousand people were mobilized in 15 minutes in front of the\npresidential palace when they tried to shut down the broadcast of the\ncorruption hearings.\n\n\"And yet every time someone from my generation talks about how important\nphones are to democracy, there's always some old pecksniff primly\ntelling us that our phones don't give us *real* democracy. It's so much\nbullshit.\"\n\nHe fell silent and they all stared at each other for a moment. Kurt's\nmouth hung open.\n\n\"I'm not old,\" he said finally.\n\n\"You're older than me,\" the kid said. His tone softened. \"Look, I'm not\ntrying to be cruel here, but you're generation-blind. The Internet is\ngreat, but it's not the last great thing we'll ever invent. My pops was\na mainframe guy, he thought PCs were toys. You're a PC guy, so you think\nmy phone is a toy.\"\n\nAlan looked off into the corner of the back room of Kurt's shop for a\nwhile, trying to marshal his thoughts. Back there, among the shelves of\nmilk crates stuffed with T-shirts and cruft, he had a thought.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"Fair enough. It may be that today, in the field,\nthere's a lot of free expression being enabled with phones. But at the\nend of the day\" -- he thought of Lyman -- \"this is the *phone company*\nwe're talking about. Big lumbering dinosaur that is thrashing in the tar\npit. The spazz dinosaur that's so embarrassed all the other dinosaurs\nthat none of them want to rescue it.\n\n\"Back in the sixties, these guys sued to keep it illegal to plug\nanything other than their rental phones into their network. But more to\nthe point, you get a different kind of freedom with an Internet network\nthan a phone-company network -- even if the Internet network lives on\ntop of the phone-company network.\n\n\"If you invent a new way of using the phone network -- say, a cheaper\nway of making long-distance calls using voice-over-IP, you can't roll\nthat out on the phone network without the permission of the carrier. You\nhave to go to him and say, 'Hey, I've invented a way to kill your most\nprofitable line of business, can you install it at your switching\nstations so that we can all talk long distance for free?'\n\n\"But on the net, anyone can invent any application that he can get his\nbuddies to use. No central authority had to give permission for the Web\nto exist: A physicist just hacked it together one day, distributed the\nsoftware to his colleagues, and in just a very short while, people all\nover the world had the Web.\n\n\"So the net can live on top of the phone network and it can run\nvoice-calling as an application, but it's not tied to the phone\nnetwork. It doesn't care whose wires or wireless it lives on top\nof. It's got all these virtues that are key to free expression. That's\nwhy we care about this.\"\n\nThe kid nodded as he talked, impatiently, signaling in body language\nthat even Alan could read that he'd heard this already.\n\n\"Yes, in this abstract sense, there are a bunch of things to like about\nyour Internet over there. But I'm talking about practical, nonabstract,\nnontheoretical stuff over here. The real world. I can get a phone for\n*free*. I can talk to *everyone* with it. I can say *anything* I want. I\ncan use it *anywhere*. Sure, the phone company is a giant conspiracy by\nThe Man to keep us down. But can you really tell me with a straight face\nthat because I can't invent the Web for my phone or make free long\ndistance calls I'm being censored?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Kurt said. Alan put a steadying hand on his\nshoulder. \"Fine, it's not an either-or thing. You can have your phones,\nI can have my Internet, and we'll both do our thing. It's not like the\nabsence of the Web for phones or high long-distance charges are *good*\nfor free expression, Christ. We're trying to unbreak the net so that no\none can own it or control it. We're trying to put it on every corner of\nthe city, for free, anonymously, for anyone to use. We're doing it with\nrecycled garbage, and we're paying homeless teenagers enough money to\nget off the street as part of the program. What's not to fucking like?\"\n\nThe kid scribbled hard on his pad. \"*Now* you're giving me some quotes I\ncan use. You guys need to work on your pitch. 'What's not to fucking\nlike?' That's good.\"\n\n#\n\nHe and Link saw each other later that day, and Link still had his two\nlittle girls with him, sitting on the patio at the Greek's, drinking\nbeers, and laughing at his jokes.\n\n\"Hey, you're the guy with the books,\" one of them said when he passed\nby.\n\nHe stopped and nodded. \"That's me, all right,\" he said.\n\nLink picked at the label of his beer bottle and added to the dandruff of\nshredded paper in the ashtray before him. \"Hey, Abe,\" he said.\n\n\"Hey, Link,\" he said. He looked down at the little girls' bags. \"You've\nmade some finds,\" he said. \"Congratulations.\"\n\nThey were wearing different clothes now -- double-knit neon pop-art\ndresses and horn-rim shades and white legs flashing beneath the\ntabletop. They kicked their toes and smiled and drank their beers, which\nseemed comically large in their hands.\n\nCasually, he looked to see who was minding the counter at the Greek's\nand saw that it was the idiot son, who wasn't smart enough to know that\nserving liquor to minors was asking for bad trouble.\n\n\"Where's Krishna?\" he asked.\n\nOne girl compressed her heart-shaped lips into a thin line.\n\n\tAnd so she resolved to help her brother, because when it's your\n\tfault that something has turned to shit, you have to wash\n\tshit. And so she resolved to help her brother, which meant that,\n\tstep one, she had to get him to stop screwing up.\n\n\"He took off,\" the girl said. Her pancake makeup had sweated away during\nthe day and her acne wasn't so bad that she'd needed it. \"He took off\nrunning, like he'd forgotten something important. Looked scared.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go get more beers,\" Link said angrily, cutting her off,\nand Alan had an intuition that Link had become Krishna's Renfield, a\nrecursion of Renfields, each nesting inside the last like Russian dolls\nin reverse: Big Link inside medium Krishna inside the stump that\nremained of Darrel.\n\n\tAnd that meant that she had to take him out of the company of\n\this bad companions, which she would accomplish through the\n\tsimple expedient of scaring the everlasting fuck out of them.\n\nShe sulked off and the remaining girl looked down at her swinging toes.\n\n\"Where'd he go, Link?\" Alan said. If Krishna was in a hurry to go\nsomewhere or see something, he had an idea of what it was about.\n\nLink's expression closed up like a door slamming shut. \"I don't know,\"\nhe said. \"How should I know?\"\n\nThe other girl scuffed her toes and took a sip of her beer.\n\nTheir gazes all flicked down to the bottle.\n\n\"The Greek would bar you for life if he knew you were bringing underaged\ndrinkers into here,\" Alan said.\n\n\"Plenty of other bars in the Market,\" Link said, shrugging his newly\nbroad shoulders elaborately.\n\n\tTrey was the kid who'd known her brother since third grade and\n\twhose puberty-induced brain damage had turned him into an utter\n\tturd. She once caught him going through the bathroom hamper,\n\tfetishizing her panties, and she'd shouted at him and he'd just\n\tducked and grinned a little-boy grin that she had been incapable\n\tof wiping off his face, no matter how she raged. She would enjoy\n\tthis.\n\n\"And they all know the Greek,\" Alan said. \"Three, two, one.\" He turned\non his heel and began to walk away.\n\n\"Wait!\" Link called. The girl swallowed a giggle. He sounded desperate\nand not cool at all anymore.\n\nAlan stopped and turned his body halfway, looking impatiently over his\nshoulder.\n\nLink mumbled something.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Behind Kurt's place,\" Link said. \"He said he was going to go look\naround behind Kurt's place.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Link,\" he said. He turned all the way around and got down to\neye level with the other girl. \"Nice to meet you,\" he said. He wanted to\ntell her, *Be careful* or *Stay alert* or *Get out while the getting's\ngood*, but none of that seemed likely to make much of an impression on\nher.\n\nShe smiled and her friend came back with three beers. \"You've got a\ngreat house,\" she said.\n\nHer friend said, \"Yeah, it's amazing.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you,\" he said.\n\n\"Bye,\" they said.\n\nLink's gaze bored into the spot between his shoulder blades the whole\nway to the end of the block.\n\n#\n\nThe back-alleys of Kensington were a maze of coach houses, fences, dead\nends and narrow doorways. Kids who knew their secrets played ball-hockey\nnearly undisturbed by cars, junkies turned them into reeking pissoirs,\nhomeless people dossed down in the lees of their low, crazy-angled\nbuildings, teenagers came and necked around corners.\n\nBut Alan knew their secrets. He'd seen the aerial maps, and he'd\nclambered their length and breadth and height with Kurt, checking sight\nlines for his network, sticking virtual pushpins into the map on his\nscreen where he thought he could get some real benefit out of an access\npoint.\n\nSo once he reached Kensington Avenue, he slipped behind a Guyanese patty\nstand and stepped through a wooden gate and began to make his way to the\nback of Kurt's place. Cautiously.\n\nFrom behind, the riot of colors and the ramshackle signs and subculture\nof Kensington was revealed as a superfice, a skin stretched over\nslightly daggy brick two-stories with tiny yards and tumbledown\ngarages. From behind, he could be walking the back ways of any anonymous\nhousing development, a no-personality greyzone of nothing and no one.\n\nThe sun went behind a cloud and the whole scene turned into something\nmonochromatic, a black-and-white clip from an old home movie.\n\nCarefully, he proceeded. Carefully, slipping from doorway to doorway,\nslipping up the alleyway to the next, to the corner that led to the\nalley that led to Kurt's. Carefully, listening, watching.\n\nAnd he managed to sneak up on Krishna and Davey, and he knew that for\nonce, he'd be in the position to throw the rocks.\n\nKrishna sat with his back against the cinderblock wall near Kurt's back\ndoor, knees and hands splayed, head down in a posture of\nsupplication. He had an unlit cigarette in his mouth, which he nervously\nshifted from corner to corner, like a soggy toothpick. Behind him,\nstanding atop the dented and scabrous garbage cans, Dumont.\n\nHe rested his head on his folded arms, which he rested on the sill, and\nhe stood on tiptoe to see in the window.\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" Krishna said. \"I want to go get some food. Can I go and\nget food and come back?\"\n\n\"Quiet,\" Dewayne said. \"Not another fucking word, you sack of shit.\" He\nsaid it quietly in a neutral tone that was belied by his words. He\nsettled his head back on his folded forearms like a babe settling its\nhead in a bosom and looked back through the window. \"Ah,\" he said, like\nhe had taken a drink.\n\nKrishna climbed slowly to his feet and stood off a pace or two, staring\nat Drew. He reached into the pocket of his old bomber jacket and found a\nlighter and flicked it nervously a couple times.\n\n\"Don't you light that cigarette,\" Davey said. \"Don't you dare.\"\n\n\"How long are we going to be here?\" Krishna's whine was utterly devoid\nof his customary swagger.\n\n\"What kind of person is he?\" Davey said. \"What kind of person is he? He\nis in love with my brother, looks at him with cow-eyes when he sees him,\nhangs on his words like a love-struck girl.\" He laughed nastily. \"Like\n*your* love-struck girl, like she looks at him.\n\n\"I wonder if he's had her yet. Do you think he has?\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" Krishna said petulantly, and levered himself to his\nfeet. He began to pace and Alan hastily backed himself into the doorway\nhe'd been hiding in. \"She's mine, no matter who she's fucking. I *own*\nher.\"\n\n\"Look at that,\" Darrel said. \"Look at him talking to them, his little\narmy, like a general giving them a pep talk. He got that from my\nbrother, I'm sure. Everywhere he goes, he leaves a trail of manipulators\nwho run other people's lives.\"\n\nAlan's stomach clenched in on itself, and his butt and thighs ached\nsuddenly, like he'd been running hard. He thought about his prot\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9g\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9s\nwith their shops and their young employees, learning the trade from them\nas they'd learned it from him. How long had Don been watching him?\n\n\"When are we going to do it?\" Krishna spat out his cigarette and shook\nanother out of his pack and stuck it in his mouth.\n\n\"Don't light it,\" Drew said. \"We're going to do it when I say it's time\nto do it. You have to watch first -- watching is the most important\npart. It's how you find out what needs doing and to whom. It's how you\nfind out where you can do the most damage.\"\n\n\"I know what needs doing,\" Krishna said. \"We can just go in there and\ntrash the place and fuck him up. That'd suit me just fine. Send the\nright message, too.\"\n\nDanny hopped down off the trash can abruptly and Krishna froze in his\npaces at the dry rasp of hard blackened skin on the pavement. Davey\nwalked toward him in a bowlegged, splay-hipped gait that was more a\nscuttle than a walk, the motion of some inhuman creature not accustomed\nto two legs.\n\n\"Have you ever watched your kind, ever? Do you understand them, even a\nlittle? Just because you managed to get a little power over one of my\npeople, you think you understand it all. You don't. That one in there is\nbone-loyal to my brother. If you vandalized his little shop, he'd just\ngo to my brother for protection and end up more loyal and more. Please\nstop thinking you know anything, it'll make it much easier for us to get\nalong.\"\n\nKrishna stiffened. \"I know things,\" he said.\n\n\"Your pathetic little birdie girl is *nothing*,\" Davey said. He stumped\nover to Krishna, stood almost on his toes, looking up at him. Krishna\ntook an involuntary step backward. \"A little one-off, a changeling\nwithout clan or magic of any kind.\"\n\nKrishna stuck his balled fists into the pockets of his space-age\nfuture-sarcastic jacket. \"I know something about *you*,\" he said. \"About\n*your* kind.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes?\" Davey's tone was low, dangerous.\n\n\"I know how to recognize you, even when you're passing for normal. I\nknow how to spot you in a crowd, in a second.\" He smiled. \"You've been\nwatching my kind all your life, but I've been watching your kind for all\nof *mine*. I've seen you on the subway and running corner stores,\nteaching in classrooms and driving to work.\"\n\nDavey smiled then, showing blackened stumps. \"Yes, you can, you\ncertainly can.\" He reached out one small, delicate hand and stroked the\ninside of Krishna's wrist. \"You're very clever that way, you are.\"\nKrishna closed his eyes and breathed heavily through his nose, as though\nin pain or ecstasy. \"That's a good skill to have.\"\n\nThey stood there for a moment while Davey slowly trailed his fingertips\nover Krishna's wrist. Then, abruptly, he grabbed Krishna's thumb and\nwrenched it far back. Krishna dropped abruptly to his knees, squeaking\nin pain.\n\n\"You can spot my kind, but you know nothing about us. You *are* nothing,\ndo you understand me?\" Krishna nodded slowly. Alan felt a sympathetic\nache in his thumb and a sympathetic grin on his face at the sight of\nKrishna knelt down and made to acquiesce. \"You understand me?\" Krishna\nnodded again.\n\nDavey released him and he climbed slowly to his feet. Davey took his\nwrist again, gently. \"Let's get you something to eat,\" he said.\n\nBefore Alan knew it, they were nearly upon him, walking back down the\nalley straight toward his hiding place. Blood roared in his ears and he\npressed his back up against the doorway. They were only a step or two\naway, and after a couple of indiscreetly loud panting gasps, he clamped\nhis lips shut and held his breath.\n\nThere was no way they could miss him. He pressed his back harder against\nthe door, and it abruptly swung open and a cold hand wrapped itself\naround his bicep and pulled his through into a darkened, oil- and\nmust-smelling garage.\n\nHe tripped over his own heel and started to go over, but a pair of hands\ncaught him and settled him gently to the floor.\n\n\"Quiet,\" came a hoarse whisper in a voice he could not place.\n\nAnd then he knew who his rescuer was. He stood up silently and gave\nBilly a long hug. He was as skinny as death.\n\n#\n\n\tTrey's phone number was still current in the video store's\n\tdatabase, so she called him.\n\n\t\"Hey, Trey,\" she said. \"It's Lara.\"\n\t\n\t\"Lara, heeeeeeyyyy,\" he said, in a tone that left no doubt that\n\the was picturing her panties. \"Sorry, your bro ain't here.\"\n\n\t\"Want to take me out to dinner tonight?\"\n\t\n\tThe silence on the other end of the line made her want to laugh,\n\tbut she bit her lip and rolled her eyes and amused the girl\n\tbrowsing the chop-socky epics and visibly eavesdropping.\n\n\t\"Trey?\"\n\t\n\t\"Lara, uh, yes, I'd love to, sure. Is this like a group thing\n\tor...\"\n\n\t\"No, Trey, I thought I'd keep this between the two of us. I'll\n\tbe at the store until six -- meet me here?\"\n\n\t\"Yeah, okay. Okay! Sure. I'll see you tonight.\"\n\n#\n\nBrad was so thin he looked like a corpse. He was still tall, though, and\nhis hair and beard were grown out into long, bad-smelling straggles of\nknot and grime. In the half-light of the garage, he had the instantly\nidentifiable silhouette of a street person.\n\nHe gathered Adam up in a hug that reeked of piss and booze, a hug like a\nbundle of twigs in his arms.\n\n\"I love you,\" he whispered.\n\nAndrew backed away and held him at arm's length. His skin had gone to\ndeep creases lined with soot, his eyes filmed with something that looked\nlike pond scum.\n\n\"Brady. What are you doing here?\"\n\nHe held a finger up to his lips, then opened the door again onto the\nnow-empty alley. Alan peered the way that Davey and Krishna had gone,\njust in time to see them turn a distant corner.\n\n\"Give it another minute,\" Blake said, drawing the door nearly closed\nagain. A moment later, they heard another door open and then Kurt's\nchain-draped boots jangled past, headed the other way. They listened to\nthem recede, and then Brian swung the door wide again.\n\n\"It's okay now,\" he said.\n\nThey stepped out into the sunlight and Bert started to walk slowly\naway. Alan caught up with him and Bert took his arm with long bony\nfingers, leaning on him. He had a slight limp.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" Alan asked when they had gone halfway home\nthrough deft, confident turnings led by Blake.\n\n\"Watching you,\" he said. \"Of course. When I came to the city, I worked\nout at the racetrack for a week and made enough money to live off of for\na couple months, and avoided the tough guys who watched me winning and\nwaited to catch me alone at the streetcar stop. I made enough and then I\nwent to watch you.\n\n\"I knew where you were, of course. Always knew where you were. I could\nsee you whenever I closed my eyes. I knew when you opened your shops and\nI went by at night and in the busy parts of the day so that I could get\na better sense of them. I kept an eye on you, Alan, watched over you. I\nhad to get close enough to smell you and hear you and see you, though,\nit wasn't enough to see you in my mind.\n\n\"Because I had to know the *why*. I could see the *what*, but I had to\nknow the *why* -- why were you opening your stores? Why were you saying\nthe things you said? I had to get close enough because from the outside,\nit's impossible to tell if you're winking because you've got a secret,\nor if you've got dust in your eye, or if you're making fun of someone\nwho's winking, or if you're trying out a wink to see how it might feel\nlater.\n\n\"It's been four years I've been watching you when I could, going back to\nthe track for more when I ran out of money, and you know what? I know\nwhat you're doing.\"\n\nAlan nodded. \"Yeah,\" he said.\n\n\"You're watching. You're doing what I'm doing. You're watching them to\nfigure out what they're doing.\"\n\nAlvin nodded. \"Yeah,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't know any more about the world than I do.\"\n\nAlbert nodded. \"Yeah,\" he said.\n\nBilly shook his head and leaned more heavily on Alan's arm. \"I want a\ndrink,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got some vodka in the freezer,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I'll take some of the Irish whiskey on the sideboard in the living\nroom.\"\n\nAdam looked at him sharply and he shrugged and smiled an apologetic\nsmile. \"I've been watching,\" he said.\n\nThey crossed the park together and Buddy stopped to look hard at the\nfountain. \"That's where he took Edward, right? I saw that.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alvin said. \"Do you know where he is now?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Billy said. \"Gone.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Adam said. \"Yeah.\"\n\nThey started walking now, Billy's limp more pronounced.\n\n\"What's with your leg?\"\n\n\"My foot. I lost a couple toes last year to frostbite and never got them\nlooked at properly.\" He reeked of piss and booze.\n\n\"They didn't...grow back?\"\n\nBradley shook his head. \"They didn't,\" he said. \"Not mine. Hello,\nKrishna,\" he said.\n\nAlan looked to his neighbors' porch. Krishna stood there, stock still,\nagainst the wall.\n\n\"Friend of yours, huh?\" Krishna said. \"Boyfriend?\"\n\n\"He offered me a bottle of wine if I let him take me home,\" Bradley\nsaid. \"Best offer I had all week. Wanna make it a threesome? An *'ow you\nsay* 'mange ma twat?'\"\n\nKrishna contorted his face into an elaborate sneer. \"Puke,\" he said.\n\n\"Bye, Krishna,\" Buddy said. Alan put his key into the lock and let them\nin.\n\nBlaine made a hobbling beeline for the sideboard and picked up the Jim\nBeam Apollo 8 commemorative decanter that Adam kept full of Bushmills\n1608 and poured himself a tall glass of it. He drank it back in two\nswallows, then rolled his tongue around in his mouth with his eyes\nclosed while he breathed out the fumes.\n\n\"I have been thinking about that bottle ever since you bought it,\" he\nsaid. \"This stuff is legendary. God, that's good. I mean, that's fucking\nmagical.\"\n\n\"It's good,\" Andrew said. \"You can have more if you want.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Burke said, and poured out another drink. He carried it and the\ndecanter to the sofa and settled into it. \"Nice sofa,\" he said. \"Nice\nliving room. Nice house. Not very normal, though.\"\n\n\"No,\" Andrew said. \"I'm not fitting in very well.\"\n\n\"I fit in great.\" He drank back another glug of whiskey and poured out\nanother twenty dollars' worth. \"Just great, it's the truth. I'm totally\ninvisible and indistinguishable. I've been sleeping at the Scott Mission\nfor six months now and no one has given me a second glance. They can't\neven steal my stuff, because when they try, when they come for my shoes\nor my food in the night, I'm always awake and watching them and just\nshaking my head.\"\n\nThe whole living room stank of whiskey fumes with an ammoniac\ntinge. \"What if I find you some clothes and a towel?\"\n\n\"Would I clean myself up? Would I get rid of this protective coloration\nand become visible again?\" He drank more, breathed out the fumes. \"Sure,\nwhy not. Why not. Time to be visible. You've seen me, Krishna's seen\nme. Davey's gonna see me. Least I got to see them first.\"\n\nAnd so he let his older brother lead him by the hand upstairs to the\nbathroom with its damp-swollen paperbacks and framed kitsch-art\npotty-training cartoons. And so he let his brother put him under the\nstinging hot shower and shampoo his hair and scrub him vigorously with a\nback brush, sluicing off the ground-in grime of the streets -- though\nthe calous pads on his hands remained as dark with soot as the feet of\nan alleycat. And so he let his older brother wash the stumps of his toes\nwhere the skin was just a waxy pucker of scar, like belly buttons, which\nneither of them had.\n\nAnd so he let his brother trim away his beard, first with scissors and\nthen with an electric razor, and so he let his brother brush out his\nlong hair and tie it back with an elastic taken from around a bunch of\nbroccoli in the vegetable crisper.\n\nAnd so, by the time the work was done and he was dressed in too-big\nclothes that hung over his sunken chest and spindly legs like a tent, he\nwas quite sober and quite clean and quite different.\n\n\"You look fine,\" Adam said, as Brent fingered his chin and watched the\nreflection in the full-length mirror on the door of Alan's study. \"You\nlook great.\"\n\n\"I look conspicuous. Visible. Used to be that eyes just slid off of\nme. Now they'll come to rest on me, if only for a few seconds.\"\n\nAndy nodded. \"Sure, that's right. You know, being invisible isn't the\nsame as being normal. Normal people are visible.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Brad said, nodding miserably. He pawed again at the smooth\nhollows of his cheeks.\n\n\"You can stay in here,\" Alan said, gesturing at his study. The desk and\nhis laptop and his little beginning of a story sat in the middle of the\nroom, surrounded by a litter of access points in various stages of\nrepair and printed literature full of optimistic, nontechnical\nexplanations of ParasiteNet. \"I'll move all that stuff out.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Billy said. \"You should. Just put it in the basement in\nboxes. I've been watching you screw around with that wireless stuff and\nyou know, it's not real normal, either. It's pretty desperately\nweird. Danny's right -- that Kurt guy, following you around, like he's\nin love with you. That's not normal.\" He flushed, and his hands were in\nfists. \"Christ, Adam, you're living in this goddamned museum and nailing\nthose stupid science-fair projects to the sides of buildings. You've got\nthis comet tail of druggy kids following you around, buying dope with\nthe money they make off of the work they do for you. You're not just\nvisible, you're *strobing*, and you're so weird even *I* get the\ncrawlies around you.\"\n\nHis bare feet slapped the shining cool wood as he paced the room, lame\nfoot making a different sound from the good one.\n\nAndy looked out the window at the green maple-keys rattling in the\nwind. \"They're buying drugs?\"\n\nBenny snorted. \"You're bankrolling weekly heroin parties at two\nwarehouses on Oxford, and three raves a month down on Liberty Street.\"\n\nHe looked up at the ceiling. \"Mimi's awake now,\" he said. \"Better\nintroduce me.\"\n\nMimi kept her own schedule, mostly nocturnal, padding quietly around his\nhouse while he slept, coming silently to bed after he rose, while he was\nin the bathroom. She hadn't spoken a word to him in more than a week,\nand he had said nothing to her. But for the snores and the warmth of the\nbed when he lay down and the morning dishes in the sink, she might not\nhave been living with him at all. But for his constant awareness of her\npresence in his house and but for the shirts with cut-away backs in the\nlaundry hamper, he might be living all on his own.\n\nBut for the knife that he found under the mattress, compass set into the\nhandle, serrated edge glinting, he might have forgotten those wings,\nwhich drooped near to the floor now.\n\nFootsteps crossing between the master bedroom and the bathroom. Pausing\nat the top of the stairs. A soft cough.\n\n\"Alan?\"\n\n\"It's okay, Mimi,\" he said.\n\nShe came down in a pair of his boxer shorts, with the topsheet\ncomplicatedly draped over her chest in a way that left her wings\nfree. Their tips touched the ground.\n\n\"This is my brother Bentley,\" Adam said. \"I told you about him.\"\n\n\"You can see the future,\" she said reproachfully.\n\n\"You have wings,\" he said.\n\nShe held out her hand and he shook it.\n\n\"I want breakfast,\" she said.\n\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Brent said.\n\nAlan nodded. \"I'll cook.\"\n\n#\n\nHe made pancakes and cut up pears and peaches and apples and bananas for\nfruit salad.\n\n\"This reminds me of the pancake house in town,\" Bart said. \"Remember?\"\n\nAdam nodded. It had been Ed-Fred-George's favorite Sunday dinner place.\n\n\"Do you live here now?\" Mimi said.\n\nAlan said, \"Yes.\" She slipped her hand into his and squeezed his\nthumb. It felt good and unexpected.\n\n\"Are you going to tell her?\" Billy said.\n\nShe withdrew her hand. \"What is it.\" Her voice was cold.\n\nBilly said, \"There's no good comes of keeping secrets. Krishna and Davey\nare planning to attack Kurt. Krishna says he owns you. He'll probably\ncome for you.\"\n\n\"Did you see that?\" Adam said. \"Him coming for her?\"\n\n\"Not that kind of seeing. I just understand enough about people to know\nwhat that means.\"\n\n\tTrey met her at six, and he was paunchier than she'd remembered,\n\this high school brawn run to a little fat. He shoved a gift into\n\ther hand, a brown paper bag with a quart of cheap vodka in\n\tit. She thanked him simperingly and tucked it in her\n\tknapsack. \"It's a nice night. Let's get takeout and eat it in\n\tHigh Park.\"\n\n\tShe saw the wheels turn in his head, meal plus booze plus\n\tsecluded park equals pussy, pussy, pussy, and she let the tip of\n\ther tongue touch her lips. This would be even easier than she'd\n\tthought.\n\n\"How can you tell the difference?\" Arthur said. \"Between seeing and\nunderstanding?\"\n\n\"You'll never mistake them. Seeing it is like remembering spying on\nsomeone, only you haven't spied on him yet. Like you were standing\nbehind him and he just didn't notice. You hear it, you smell it, you see\nit. Like you were standing *in* him sometimes, like it happened to you.\n\n\"Understanding, that's totally different. That's like a little voice in\nyour head explaining it to you, telling you what it all means.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Andy said.\n\n\"You thought you'd seen, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Thought that I was running out of time and going to die, or kill\nDavey again, or something. It was a feeling, though, not like being\nthere, not like having anything explained.\"\n\n\"Is that going to happen?\" Mimi asked Brad.\n\nBrad looked down at the table. \"'Answer unclear, ask again later.'\nThat's what this Magic 8-Ball I bought in a store once used to say.\"\n\n\"Does that mean you don't know?\"\n\n\"I think it means I don't want to know.\"\n\n#\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Bert said. \"Kurt's safe tonight.\"\n\nAlan stopped lacing up his shoes and slumped back on the bench in his\nfoyer. Mimi had done the dishes, Bill had dried, and he'd fretted about\nKurt. But it wasn't until he couldn't take it anymore and was ready to\ngo and find him, bring him home if necessary, that Billy had come to\ntalk to him.\n\n\"Do you know that for sure?\"\n\n\"Yes. He has dinner with a woman, then he takes her dumpster diving and\ncomes home and goes to bed. I can see that.\"\n\n\"But you don't see everything?\"\n\n\"No, but I saw that.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Adam said. He felt hopeless in the face of these predictions, as\nthough the future were something set and immutable.\n\n\"I need to use the bathroom,\" Billy said, and made his way upstairs\nwhile Alan moved to a sofa and paged absently through an old edition of\n*Alice in Wonderland* whose marbled frontispiece had come detached.\n\nA moment later, Mimi joined him, sitting down next to him, her wings\nunfolded across the sofa back.\n\n\"How big are they going to get, do you think?\" she said, arranging them.\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\n\"They're bigger than they've ever been. That was good food,\" she\nsaid. \"I think I should go talk to Krishna.\"\n\nAdam shook his head. \"Whoa.\"\n\n\"You don't need to be in between us. Maybe I can get him to back off on\nyou, on your family.\"\n\n\"Mimi, I don't even want to discuss it.\"\n\n\"It's the right thing to do,\" she said. \"It's not fair to you to stay.\"\n\n\"You want to have your wings cut,\" Alan said. \"That's why you want to go\nback to him.\"\n\nShe shied back as though he'd slapped her. \"No --\"\n\n\"You do. But what Billy didn't tell you is that Krishna's out there with\nother women, I saw him today. With a girl. Young. Pretty. Normal. If he\ntakes you back, it will be as a toy, not as a lover. He can't love.\"\n\n\"Christ,\" she said. \"Why are you saying this?\"\n\n\"Because I don't want to watch you self-destruct, Mimi. Stay here. We'll\nsort out Krishna together. And my brother. Billy's here now, that means\nthey can't sneak up on us.\"\n\n\"And these?\" she said, flapping her wings, one great heave that sent\ncurrents of air across the room, that blew the loose frontispiece from\n*Alice in Wonderland* toward the fireplace grate. \"You'll sort these\nout, too?\"\n\n\"What do you want from me, Mimi?\" He was angry now. She hadn't spoken a\nword to him in weeks, and now --\n\n\"Cut them off, Alan. Make me into someone who can go out again, who can\nbe seen. Do it. I have the knife.\"\n\nAdam squeezed his eyes shut. \"No,\" he said.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, and stood, headed for the stairs. Upstairs, the\ntoilet flushed and they heard the sink running.\n\n\"Wait!\" he said, running after her. She had her hand on the doorknob.\n\n\"No,\" she said. She was crying now. \"I won't stay. I won't be trapped\nagain. Better to be with him than trapped --\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" he said. \"If you still want me to do it in two days, I'll\ndo it.\"\n\nShe looked gravely at him. \"Don't you lie to me about this,\" she\nsaid. \"Don't you dare be lying.\"\n\nHe took her hands. \"I swear,\" he said.\n\nFrom the top of the stairs then, \"Whups,\" said Billy. \"I think I'll just\ntuck myself into bed.\"\n\nMimi smiled and hugged Alan fiercely.\n\n\tTrey's ardor came out with his drunkenness. First a clammy arm\n\taround her shoulder, then a casual grope at her boob, then a\n\tsloppy kiss on the corner of her mouth. That was as far as she\n\twas going to let it go. She waited for him to move in for\n\tanother kiss, then slipped out from under his arm so that he\n\tfell into the roots of the big tree they'd been leaning\n\tagainst. She brained him with the vodka bottle before he'd had a\n\tchance to recover, then, as he rocked and moaned, she calmly\n\ttook the hunting knife she'd bought at the Yonge Street\n\tsurvivalist store out of her bag. She prized one of his hands\n\toff his clutched head and turned it over, then swiftly drew the\n\tblade across his palm, laying it open to the muscle.\n\n\tShe hadn't been sure that she'd be capable of doing that, but it\n\twas easier than she'd thought. She had nothing to worry\n\tabout. She was capable of that and more.\n\n#\n\nThey climbed into bed together at the same time for the first time since\nthey'd come home, like a domesticated couple, and Mimi dug under her\npillow and set something down with a tin *tink* on the bedstand, a sound\ntoo tinny to be the hunting knife. Alan squinted. It was the robot, the\none he'd given her, the pretty thing with the Dutch Master craquelure up\nits tuna-can skirts.\n\n\"He's beautiful,\" she said. \"Like you.\" She wrapped her wings around him\ntightly, soft fur softer than any down comforter, and pressed her\ndimpled knees into the hollows of his legs, snuggling in.\n\n\tHe cried like a baby once the pain in his hand set in. She\n\tpointed the knifepoint at his face, close enough to stab him if\n\tneed be. \"I won't kill you if you don't scream,\" she said. \"But\n\tI will be taking one joint of one toe and one joint of one\n\tfinger tonight. Just so you know.\"\n\nHe tried not to fall asleep, tried to stay awake and savor that feeling\nof her pressed against him, of her breath on the nape of his neck, of\nthe enfolded engulfment of her wings, but he couldn't keep his eyes\nopen. Soon enough, he was asleep.\n\nWhat roused him, he couldn't say, but he found himself groggily awake in\nthe close heat of those wings, held tight. He listened attentively,\nheard something else, a tinny sound. The robot.\n\nHis bladder was full. He gently extricated himself from Mimi, from her\nwings, and stood. There was the robot, silhouetted on the end table. He\nsmiled and padded off to the toilet. He came back to find Mimi splayed\nacross the whole bed, occupying its length and breadth, a faintly\nnaughty smile on her face. He began to ease himself into bed again, when\nhe heard the sound, tinny, a little rattle. He looked at the robot.\n\nIt was moving. Its arms were moving. That was impossible. Its arms were\npainted on. He sat up quickly, rousing Mimi, who let out a small sound,\nand something small and bent emerged from behind the robot and made a\ndash for the edge of the end table. The way the thing ran, it reminded\nhim of an animal that had been crippled by a trap. He shrank back from\nit instinctively, even as he reached out for the table light and\nswitched it on.\n\nMimi scrunched her eyelids and flung an arm over her face, but he hardly\nnoticed, even when she gave an outraged groan. He was looking at the\nlittle, crippled thing, struggling to get down off the end table on\nMimi's side of the bed.\n\nIt was the Allen. Though he hadn't seen it in nearly 20 years, he\nrecognized it. Tiny, malformed, and bandy-legged, it was still the\nspitting image of him. Had Davey been holding on to it all these years?\nTending it in a cage? Torturing it with pins?\n\nMimi groaned again. \"Switch off the light, baby,\" she said, a moment's\ndomesticity.\n\n\"In a sec,\" he said, and edged closer to the Allen, which was huddled in\non itself, staring and crazy.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Adam breathed. \"It's okay.\" He very slowly moved one hand toward\nthe end table, leaning over Mimi, kneeing her wing out of the way.\n\nThe Allen shied back farther.\n\n\"What're you doing?\" Mimi said, squinting up at him.\n\n\"Be very still,\" he said to her. \"I don't want to frighten it. Don't\nscream or make any sudden movements. I'm counting on you.\"\n\nHer eyes grew round and she slowly looked over toward the end table. She\nsucked in sudden air, but didn't scream.\n\n\"What is --\"\n\n\"It's me,\" he said. \"It grew out of a piece of me. My thumb. After Davey\nbit it off.\"\n\n\"Jesus,\" she said.\n\nThe Allen was quaking now, and Alan cooed to it.\n\n\"It's hurt,\" Mimi said.\n\n\"A long time ago,\" Andreas said.\n\n\"No, now. It's bleeding.\"\n\nShe was right. A small bead of blood had formed beneath it. He extended\nhis hand farther. Its bandy scurry was pathetic.\n\nHolding his breath, Alan lifted the Allen gently, cradling it in his\npalms. It squirmed and thrashed weakly. \"Shh,\" he said again. His hands\nwere instantly made slippery and sticky with its blood. \"Shh.\" Something\nsharp pricked at his hand.\n\nNow that he had it up close, he could see where the blood was coming\nfrom: A broken-off sewing needle, shoved rudely through its distended\nabdomen.\n\n\"Cover up,\" Bradley said, \"I'm coming up.\" They heard his lopsided tread\non the steps.\n\nMimi pulled the blanket up around her chin. \"Okay,\" she said.\n\nBert opened the door quickly. He wore nothing but the oversized jeans\nthat Alan had given him, his scrawny chest and mutilated feet bare.\n\n\"It's going to die,\" Brad said, hunkering down beside the bed. \"Davey\npinned it and then sent Link over with it. It can't last through the\nnight.\"\n\nAdam felt like he was choking. \"We can help it,\" he said. \"It can\nheal. It healed before.\"\n\n\"It won't this time. See how much pain it's in? It's out of its mind.\"\n\n\"So what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"We need to put it out of its misery,\" Brad said. \"It's the right\nthing.\"\n\nIn his hands, the thing squirmed and made a small, hurt sound. \"Shhh,\"\nAlan said. The sound it made was like sobbing, but small, so small. And\nweak.\n\nMimi said, \"I think I'm going to be sick.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Brian said. \"Yeah, I can see that.\"\n\nShe lifted herself out of bed, unmindful of her nudity, and pushed her\nway past him to the door, to the bathroom.\n\n\t\"Stop being such a baby,\" she told Trey as he clutched at his\n\tfoot. \"It's almost stopped bleeding already.\"\n\n\tHe looked up at her with murder in his eyes. \"Shall I take\n\tanother one?\" she said. He looked away.\n\n\t\"If I get word that you've come within a mile of my brother, I\n\twill come back and take your eyes. The toe and the finger joint\n\twere just a down payment on that.\"\n\n\tHe made a sullen sound, so she took his vain and girlish blond\n\thair in her fist and tugged his head back and kissed his throat\n\twith the knife.\n\n\t\"Nod if you understand. Slowly.\"\n\t\n#\n\n\"The knife is under Mimi's pillow.\"\n\n\"I can't do it,\" Alan said.\n\n\"I know,\" Brian said. \"I will.\"\n\nAnd he did. Took the knife. Took the Allen. It cried. Mimi threw up in\nanother room, the sound more felt than heard. The toilet flushed and\nBrian's hands were sure and swift, but not sure enough. The Allen made a\nsound like a dog whistle. Bruce's hand moved again, and then it was\nover. He dug a sock out of the hamper and rolled up the Allen's remains\nin it. \"I'll bury it,\" he said. \"In the back.\"\n\nNumbly, Alan stood and began dressing. \"No,\" he said. \"I will.\"\n\nMimi joined them, wrapped in a blanket. Alan dug and Brent held the sock\nand Mimi watched solemnly.\n\nA trapezoid of light knifed across the back garden. They looked up and\nsaw Krishna staring down at them from a third-floor window. He was\nsmiling very slightly. A moment later, Link appeared in the window,\nreeling like he was drunk, giggling.\n\nThey all looked at one another for a frozen moment, then Alan turned\nback to his shoveling. He dug down three feet, and Brent laid the little\nAllen down in the earth gently as putting it to bed, and Alan filled the\nhole back up. Mimi looked back up at the window, eyes locked on\nKrishna's.\n\n\"I'm going inside,\" Adam announced. \"Are you coming?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Mimi said, but she didn't. She stayed out there for ten minutes,\nthen twenty, and when Alan looked out his window at her, he saw she was\nstill staring up at Krishna, mesmerized.\n\nHe loudly opened his window and leaned out. Mimi's eyes flicked to him,\nand then she slowly made her way back into the house.\n\n\tShe took his pants and his shoes and left him in the park,\n\tcrying and drunk. All things considered, it had gone well. When\n\tTrey told her that he had no idea where her brother was, she\n\tbelieved him. It was okay, she'd find her brother. He had lots\n\tof friends.\n\nAlan thought that that was the end of the story, maybe. Short and\nsweet. A kind of lady or the tiger thing. Let the reader's imagination\ndo the rest.\n\nThere on the screen, it seemed awfully thin. Here in the house he'd\nbuilt for it, it seemed awfully unimportant. Such a big and elaborate\nenvelope for such a small thing. He saved the file and went back up to\nbed. Mimi was asleep, which was good, because he didn't think he'd be\nable to fall asleep with her twice that night.\n\nHe curled up on his side of the bed and closed his eyes and tried to\nforget the sound the Allen had made.\n\n#\n\n\t\"What is wrong with you?\"\n\t\n\t\"Not a thing,\" she said. Her brother's phone-call hadn't been\n\tunexpected.\n\n\t\"You're fucking insane.\"\n\t\n\t\"Maybe,\" she said.\n\t\n\t\"What do you *want from me*?\"\n\t\n\t\"I want you to behave yourself.\"\n\t\n\t\"You're completely fucking insane.\"\n\nHe woke to find Billy gone, and had a momentary panic, a flashback to\nthe day that Fred had gone missing in the night. But then he found a\nnote on the kitchen table, terse: \"Gone out. B.\" The handwriting sent\nhim back through the years to the days before Davey came home, the days\nwhen they'd been a family, when he'd signed Brad's report cards and\nhugged him when he came home with a high-scoring paper.\n\nMimi came down while he was holding the note, staring at the few spare\nwords there. She was draped in her wings.\n\n\"Where did he go?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Alan said. \"Out.\"\n\n\"Is this what your family is like?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alan said. \"This is what they're like.\"\n\n\"Are you going to go out, too?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she said. She was angry. She stomped out of the kitchen, and\nstepped on her own wing, tripping, going over on her face. \"Tomorrow,\nyou cut these tomorrow!\" she said, and her wings flared open, knocking\nthe light fixtures a-swing and tumbling piles of books. \"Tomorrow!\" she\nsaid.\n\n#\n\n\"Good morning, Natalie,\" he said. She was red-eyed and her face was\npuffy, and her hand shook so that the smoke from her cigarette rose in a\nnervous spiral.\n\n\"Andy,\" she said, nodding.\n\nHe looked at her across the railing that divided their porches. \"Would\nyou like to join me for a coffee?\"\n\n\"I'm hardly dressed for it,\" she said. She was wearing a pair of cutoffs\nand house slippers and a shapeless green T-shirt that hung down past her\nbutt.\n\n\"The Greek doesn't stand on ceremony,\" he said. He was hardly dressed\nbetter. He hadn't wanted to go up to the master bedroom and face Mimi,\nso he'd dressed himself out of the laundry hamper in the basement.\n\n\"I don't have *shoes*, Alan.\"\n\n\"You could go in and get some,\" he said.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\nHer shoulders were tensed, her whole skinny body a cringe.\n\n\"We'll go barefoot and sit on the patio,\" he said after a moment,\nkicking his shoes off.\n\nShe looked at him and gave a sad laugh. \"Okay.\"\n\nThe sidewalk was still cool enough for bare feet. The Greek didn't give\ntheir bare feet a second look, but brought iced coffees and yogurt with\nwalnuts and honey.\n\n\"Do you want to tell me about them?\"\n\n\"It's been bad ever since -- ever since Mimi left. All of a sudden,\nKrishna's Link's best friend. He follows him around.\"\n\nAlan nodded. \"Krishna beat Mimi up,\" he said.\n\n\"I know it,\" she said. \"I heard it. I didn't do anything, goddamn me,\nbut I heard it happen.\"\n\n\"Eat,\" he said. \"Here.\" He reached for a clean napkin from the next\ntable and handed it to her. She dried her eyes and wiped her nose and\nate a spoonful of yogurt. \"Drink,\" he said, and handed her the\ncoffee. She drank.\n\n\"They brought those girls home last night. *Little*\ngirls. Teenyboppers. Disappeared into their bedrooms. The noises they\nmade.\"\n\n\"Drink,\" Alan said, and then handed her the napkin again.\n\n\"Drunk. They got them drunk and brought them home.\"\n\n\"You should get out of there,\" Andrew said, surprising himself. \"Get\nout. Today, even. Go stay with your mom and find a new apartment next\nmonth.\"\n\nShe set her cup down carefully. \"No,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm serious. It's a bad situation that you can't improve and the more\nyou stay there, the worse it's going to get.\"\n\n\"That's not a practical suggestion.\"\n\n\"Staying there, in potential danger, is not practical. You need to get\nout. Staying there will only make things worse for you.\"\n\nShe clenched her jaw. \"You know, there comes a point where you're not\ngiving advice anymore. There comes a point where you're just moralizing,\ndemonstrating your hypothetical superiority when it comes to doing the\nright thing. That's not very fucking helpful, you know. I'm holding my\nshit together right now, and rather than telling me that it's not\nenough, you could try to help me with the stuff I'm capable of.\"\n\nAlan digested this. She'd said it loudly, and a few of the other morning\npatrons at the Greek's were staring at them. He looked away, across the\nstreet, and spied Billy standing in a doorway, watching. Billy met his\neyes, then looked away.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Natalie,\" he said. \"You're right.\"\n\nShe blew air out her nostrils.\n\n\"What about this. You can knock on my door any time. I'll make up the\nsofa for you.\" He thought of Mimi and cringed inwardly. She'd have to\nstay upstairs and be quiet if there were strangers in the house. Then he\nremembered his promise about her wings. He bit his lip.\n\nShe let out a harsh chuckle. \"Will I be any safer there?\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"You're the weirdest person I've ever met, Alvin. I mean, sorry, no\noffense, but why the hell would I knock on your door?\"\n\nShe stood and turned on her barefoot heel and took herself away, walking\nat a brisk and gingerly pace.\n\nBarry moseyed over and sat in her seat. \"She'll be okay,\" he said. He\npicked up her spoon and began to finish her breakfast. \"You know, I\ncan't watch the way I could yesterday, not anymore. Too visible. What do\nI do now?\"\n\nAaron shrugged. \"Find a job. Be visible. Get a place to live. We can\nhave each other over for dinner.\"\n\nBrett said, \"Maybe I could get a job where I got to watch. Security\nguard.\"\n\nAugust nodded. He closed his eyes.\n\n\"She's very pretty,\" Barry said. \"Prettier than Mimi.\"\n\n\"If you say so.\"\n\n\"Kurt's awake.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah. You could introduce me to him.\"\n\n\tI did it for your own good, you know. She couldn't bring herself\n\tto say the words, for the enormity of what she'd done was\n\toverwhelming her. She'd found three of his friends and treated\n\teach of them to an evening of terror and hurt, and none of them\n\twould tell her where her brother was, none of them knew. Maybe\n\tthey'd been innocent all along.\n\n\t\"Where are you?\"\n\t\n\t\"Far from you,\" he said. In the background, she heard a girl\n\tcrying.\n\n#\n\n\"It's going to happen, we're going to cover the whole Market,\" Kurt\nsaid. He had the latest coverage map out and it looked like he was\nright. \"Look at this.\" The overlapping rings of WiFi false-colored over\nthe map were nearly total.\n\n\"Are those our own nodes, or just friendlies?\" Alan asked, all his\nconfusion and worry forgotten at the sight of the map.\n\n\"Those are our own,\" Kurt said. \"Not so many friendlies.\" He tapped a\nkey and showed a map of the city with a pitiful sprinkling of fellow\ntravelers who'd opened up their networks and renamed them \"ParasiteNet.\"\n\n\"You'll have more,\" Buddy said. Kurt looked a question at Alan.\n\n\"My brother Brent,\" he said. \"Meet Kurt.\"\n\nThey shook.\n\n\"Your brother?\"\n\nAdam nodded.\n\n\"Not one of the missing ones?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"A different one.\"\n\n\"It's nice to meet you.\" Kurt wiped off his palms. Adam looked around\nthe little private nest at the back of the shop, at the small, meshed-in\nwindow on the back wall. Danny watched at that window sometimes.\n\n\"I'm gonna send a screengrab of this to Lyman, he'll bust a nut.\"\n\nIt made Anton smile. Lyman and Kurt were the unlikeliest of pals, but\npals they were.\n\n\"You do that.\"\n\n\"Why aren't you wearing shoes?\"\n\nAnton smiled shyly. \"No volunteers today?\"\n\nKurt shrugged, a jingle of chains. \"Nope. Slow day. Some days just\nare. Was thinking of seeing a movie or something. Wanna come?\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Anton said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Brett said, oblivious to the fact that the invitation hadn't\nreally been directed at him. \"I'd like that.\"\n\n\"O-kaaay,\" Kurt said. \"Great. Gimme an hour or so and meet me out\nfront.\"\n\n\"It's a date.\"\n\n#\n\nHe was half a block from home when he spotted Natalie sitting on her\nporch, staring at the park. Kurt and Link were gone. The patio at the\nGreek's was full. He was stood in his bare feet in the middle of\nKensington Market on a busy shopping day, and he had absolutely nowhere\nto go. Nowhere he belonged.\n\nHe realized that Natalie had never put him in touch with her boss at\nMartian Signal.\n\nBarefoot, there wasn't much of anywhere he could go. But he didn't want\nto be home with Mimi and he didn't want to walk past Natalie. Barefoot,\nhe ended up in the alleyway behind Kurt's again, with nowhere else to\ngo.\n\n#\n\nBlake and Kurt got back around suppertime, and by then Alan had counted\nevery shingle on the roofs of the garages, had carefully snapped the\nsharps off of two syringes he found in some weeds, and then sat and\nwaited until he was ready to scream.\n\nBlake walked confidently into the shop, through Kurt's nest, and to the\nback door. He opened it and smiled at Adam. \"Come on in,\" he said.\n\n\"Right,\" Alan said. \"How was the movie?\"\n\n\"It was fine,\" Kurt said.\n\n\"Incredible,\" Burt said. \"I mean, *incredible*. God, I haven't been to\nthe movies in ten years at least. So *loud*, Jesus, I've never heard\nanything like that.\"\n\n\"It was just A&E,\" Kurt said. \"Asses and explosions.\"\n\nAlan felt a wave of affection for his friend, and an indefinite sadness,\na feeling that they were soon to be parted.\n\nKurt stretched and cracked his knuckles. \"Getting time for me to go out\ndiving.\"\n\n\"Let's go get some dinner, okay?\" Andy said to Brad.\n\n\"G'night guys,\" Kurt said, locking the door behind them.\n\n\t\"I'm sorry,\" she said. There had been five minutes of\n\tnear-silence on the line, only the girl crying in the background\n\tat his end. She wasn't sure if he'd set the phone down or if he\n\twas listening, but the \"sorry\" drew a small audible breath out\n\tof him.\n\n\t\"I'm really, really sorry,\" she said, and her hands felt sticky\n\twith blood. \"God, I just wanted to *save you*.\"\n\n#\n\nMimi was back in bed when they got home. Alan took a shower and scrubbed\nat his feet, then padded silently around the shuttered bedroom, dressing\nin the dark. Mimi made a sleepful noise.\n\n\"I'm making dinner,\" he said. \"Want some?\"\n\n\"Can you bring it up here?\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" he said.\n\n\"I just can't face --\" She waved a hand at the door, then let it flop\nback down to the bed.\n\n\"It's all right, babe,\" he said.\n\nHe and Brad ate dinner in silence in the kitchen, boiled hot dogs with\ncheese and sliced baby tomatoes from the garden and lemonade from\nscratch. Bradley ate seven. Mimi had three bites out of the one that he\nbrought up to her room, and when he went up to collect her plate, she\nwas asleep and had the covers wrapped snugly around her. He took a spare\nsheet and a blanket out of the linen closet and brought it downstairs\nand made up the living room sofa. In moments, he was sleeping.\n\nThis night, he was keenly aware of what had roused him from sleep. It\nwas a scream, at the back of the house. A scared, drunken scream that\nwas half a roar.\n\nHe was at the back door in a moment, still scrubbing at his eyes with\nhis fists, and Bennett was there already.\n\nHe opened the door and hit the switch that turned on the garden lights,\nthe back porch lights, the garage lights in the coach house. It was\nbright enough to dazzle him, but he'd squinted in anticipation.\n\nSo it only took him a moment to take in the tableau. There was Link, on\nthe ground, splayed out and face down, wearing boxer shorts and nothing\nelse, his face in a vegetable bed in the next door yard. There was\nKrishna, standing in the doorway, face grim, holding a hammer and\nadvancing on Link.\n\nHe shouted, something wordless and alarmed, and Link rolled over and\nclimbed up to his feet and lurched a few steps deeper into the\npostage-stamp-sized yard, limping badly. Krishna advanced two steps into\nthe yard, hammer held casually at his waist.\n\nAlan, barefoot, ran to the dividing fence and threw himself at it going\nup it like a cat, landing hard and painfully, feeling something small\nand important give in his ankle. Krishna nodded cordially at him, then\nhefted the hammer again.\n\nKrishna took another step toward Alan and then Natalie, moving so fast\nthat she was a blur, streaked out of the back door, leaping onto\nKrishna's back. She held there for a minute and he rocked on his heels,\nbut then he swung the hammer back, the claws first.\n\nIt took her just above her left eye with a sound like an awl punching\nthrough leather and her cry was terrible. She let go and fell over\nbackward, holding her face, screaming.\n\nBut it was enough time, enough distraction, and Alan had hold of\nKrishna's wrist. Remembering a time a long time ago, he pulled Krishna's\nhand to his face, heedless of the shining hammer, and bit down on the\nbase of his thumb as hard as he could, until Krishna loosed the hammer\nwith a shout. It grazed Alan's temple and then bounced off his\ncollarbone on the way to the ground, and he was momentarily stunned.\n\nAnd here was Link, gasping with each step, left leg useless, but hauling\nhimself forward anyway, big brawny arms reaching for Krishna, pasting a\nhard punch on his cheek and then taking hold of his throat and bearing\nhim down to the ground.\n\nAlan looked around. Benny was still on his side of the fence. Mimi's\nface poked out from around the door. The sound of another hard punch\nmade him look around as Link shook the ache out of his knuckles and made\nto lay another on Krishna's face. He had a forearm across his throat,\nand Krishna gasped for breath.\n\n\"Don't,\" Adam said. Link looked at him, lip stuck out in belligerence.\n\n\"Stop me,\" he said. \"Try it. Fucker took a hammer to my *knee*.\"\n\nNatalie went to him, her hand over her face. \"Don't do it,\" she\nsaid. She put a hand on his shoulder. \"We'll call the cops.\"\n\nKrishna made a choking sound. Link eased up on him a little, and he drew\na ragged breath. \"Go ahead and call them,\" he rasped.\n\nAlan took a slow step back. \"Brian, can you bring me the phone, please?\"\n\nLink looked at his sister, blood streaming down her face, at Krishna's\nmisshapen nose and mouth, distorted into a pink, meaty sneer. He\nclenched each fist in turn.\n\n\"No cops,\" he said.\n\nNatalie spat. \"Why the hell not?\" She spat again. Blood was running into\nher eye, down her cheek, into her mouth.\n\n\"The girl, she's inside. Drunk. She's only 15.\"\n\nAlan watched the brother and sister stare at one another. Blaine handed\nhim the phone. He hit a speed dial.\n\n\"I need a taxi to Toronto Western Hospital at 22 Wales Avenue, at\nAugusta,\" he said. He hung up. \"Go out front,\" he told Natalie. \"Get a\ntowel for your face on your way.\"\n\n\"Andrew --\" she said.\n\n\"I'll call the cops,\" he said. \"I'll tell them where to find you.\"\n\nIt was as she turned to go that Krishna made a lunge for the\nhammer. Billy was already kicking it out of the way, and Link, thrown\nfrom his chest, got up on one knee and punched him hard in the kidneys,\nand he went back down. Natalie was crying again.\n\n\"Go,\" Alan said, gently. \"We'll be okay.\"\n\nShe went.\n\nLink's chest heaved. \"I think you need to go to the hospital too, Link,\"\nAlan said. The injured knee was already so swollen that it was visible,\nlike a volleyball, beneath his baggy trousers.\n\n\"No,\" Link said. \"I wait here.\"\n\n\"You don't want to be here when the cops arrive,\" Alan said.\n\nKrishna, face down in the dirt, spat. \"He's not going to call any cops,\"\nhe said. \"It's grown-up stuff, little boy. You should run along.\"\n\nAbsently, Link punched him in the back of the head. \"Shut up,\" he\nsaid. He was breathing more normally now. He shifted and made a\nsqueaking sound.\n\n\"I just heard the cab pull up,\" Alan said. \"Brian can help you to the\nfront door. You can keep your sister company, get your knee looked at.\"\n\n\"The girl --\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. She'll be sober in the morning, and gone. I'll see to it,\" Adam\nsaid. \"All right?\"\n\nBrian helped him to his feet and toward the door, and Andrew stood\nwarily near Krishna.\n\n\"Get up,\" he said.\n\nMimi, in his doorway, across the fence, made a sound that was half a\nmoan.\n\nKrishna lay still for a moment, then slowly struggled to his knees and\nthen his feet.\n\n\"Now what?\" Krishna said, one hand pressed to his pulped cheek.\n\n\"I'm not calling the cops,\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" Krishna said.\n\n\"Remember what I told you about my brother? I *made him*. I'm stronger\nthan him, Krishna. You picked the wrong Dracula to Renfield for. You are\ndoomed. When you leave him, he will hunt you down. If you don't leave\nhim, I'll get you. You made this situation.\"\n\nBilly was back now, in the doorway, holding the hammer. He'd hand it to\nAdam if he asked for it. He could use it. After all, once you've killed\nyour brother, why not kill his Renfield, too?\n\nKrishna looked scared, a little scared. Andrew teased at how that felt\nand realized that it didn't feel like he'd thought it would. It didn't\nfeel good.\n\n\"Go, Krishna,\" he said. \"Get out of this house and get out of my sight\nand don't ever come back again. Stay away from my brother. You will\nnever profit by your association with him. He is dead. The best he can\ndo for you is make you dead, too. Go.\"\n\nAnd Krishna went. Slowly. Painfully. He stood and hobbled toward the\nfront door.\n\nMimi watched him go, and she smiled once he was gone.\n\nBenny said, \"Kurt's shop is on fire.\"\n\n#\n\nThey ran, the two of them, up Augusta, leaving Mimi behind, wrapped in\nher blanket. They could smell the smoke as soon as they crossed\nKensington, and they could see the flames licking out of the dark black\nclouds just a moment later.\n\nThe smell was terrible, a roiling chemical reek that burned the skin and\nthe lungs and the eyes. All those electronics, crisping and curling and\nblackening.\n\n\"Is he in there?\" Alan said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Barry said. \"Trapped.\"\n\n\"Call the fire department,\" Andrew said, and ran for the door, fishing\nin his pocket for his keys. \"Call 911.\"\n\nHe got the door open and left his keys in the lock, pulling his shirt up\nover his head. He managed a step into the building, two steps, and the\nheat beat him back.\n\nHe sucked up air and ran for it again.\n\nThe heat was incredible, searing. He snorted half a breath and felt the\nhair inside his nostrils scorch and curl and the burning was nearly\nintolerable. He dropped down on all fours and tried to peer under the\nsmoke, tried to locate Kurt, but he couldn't find him.\n\nAlan crawled to the back of the store, to Kurt's den, sure that his\nfriend would have been back there, worn out from a night's dumpster\ndiving. He took a false turn and found himself up against the\nrefrigerator. The little piece of linoleum that denoted Kurt's kitchen\nwas hot and soft under his hands, melting and scorching. He reoriented\nhimself, spinning around slowly, and crawled again.\n\nTears were streaming freely down his face, and between them and the\nsmoke, he could barely see. He drew closer to the shop's rear, nearly\nthere, and then he was there, looking for Kurt.\n\nHe found him, leaned up against the emergency door at the back of the\nshop, fingers jammed into the sliver of a gap between the door's bottom\nand the ground. Alan tried the door's pushbar, but there was something\nblocking the door from the other side.\n\nHe tried slapping Kurt a couple times, but he would not be roused. His\nbreath came in tiny puffs. Alan took his hand, then the other hand, and\nhoisted his head and neck and shoulders up onto his back and began to\ncrawl for the front door, going as fast as he could in the blaze.\n\nHe got lost again, and the floor was hot enough to raise blisters. When\nhe emerged with Kurt, he heard the sirens. He breathed hard in the night\nair.\n\nAs he watched, two fire trucks cleared the corner, going the wrong way\ndown one-way Augusta, speeding toward him. He looked at Billy.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Is Kurt all right?\"\n\n\"Sure, he's fine.\" He thought a moment. \"The ambulance man will want to\ntalk with him, he said. \"And the TV people, soon.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" Brad said.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Now you're talking.\"\n\nThough it was only three or four blocks back to Adam's place, it took\nthe better part of half an hour, relying on the back alleys and the dark\nto cover his retreat, hoping that the ambulance drivers and firefighters\nwouldn't catch him here. Having to lug Kurt made him especially suspect,\nand he didn't have a single good explanation for being caught toting\naround an unconscious punk in the dead of night.\n\n\"Come on, Brent,\" Adam said. \"Let's get home and put this one to bed and\nyou and me have a nice chat.\"\n\n\"You don't want me to call an ambulance?\"\n\nKurt startled at this and his head lolled back, one eye opened a crack.\n\n\"No,\" Alan said. \"No ambulances. No cops. No firemen. Just me and\nhim. I'll make him better,\" he said.\n\nThe smoke smell was terrible and pervaded everything, no matter which\ndirection the wind blew from.\n\nAdam was nearly home when he realized that his place and his lover and\neverything he cared about in the entire world were *also* on fire, which\ncouldn't possibly be a coincidence.\n\n#\n\nThe flames licked his porch and the hot air had blown out two of the\nwindows on the second story. The flames were lapping at the outside of\nthe building, crawling over the inside walls.\n\nNo coincidence.\n\nKurt coughed hard, his chest spasming against Alan's back. Alan set him\ndown, as in a dream. As in a dream, he picked his way through the flames\non his porch and reached for the doorknob. It burned his hand.\n\nIt was locked. His keys were in Kurt's door, all the way up Augusta.\n\n\"Around the back,\" Bentley called, headed for the fence gate. Alan\nvaulted the porch rail, crashing though the wild grasses and ornamental\nscrub. \"Come on,\" Bentley said.\n\nHis hand throbbed with the burn. The back yard was still lit up like\nChristmas, all the lights ablaze, shining through the smoke, the ash of\nbooks swirling in it, buoyed aloft on hot currents, fragments of words\nchasing each other like clouds of gnats.\n\n\"Alan,\" Kurt croaked. Somehow, he'd followed them back into the\nyard. \"Alan.\" He held out his hand, which glowed blue-white. Alan looked\ncloser. It was his PDA, stubby wireless card poking out of it. \"I'm\nonline. Look.\"\n\nAlan shook his head. \"Not now.\" Mimi, somewhere up there was Mimi.\n\n\"Look,\" Kurt croaked. He coughed again and went down to his knees.\n\nArnos took the PDA in hand and peered at it. It was a familiar app, the\ntraffic analysis app, the thing that monitored packet loss between the\nnodes. Lyman and Kurt had long since superimposed the logical network\nmap over a physical map of the Market, using false-color overlays to\nshow the degree to which the access points were well connected and\nfiring on all cylinders.\n\nThe map was painted in green, packets flying unimpeded throughout the\nempty nighttime Market. And there, approaching him, moving through the\nalleys toward his garage, a blob of interference, a slow, bobbing\nsomething that was scattering radio waves as it made its way toward\nhim. Even on a three-inch screen, he recognized that walk. Davey.\n\nNot a coincidence, the fires.\n\n\"Mimi!\" he called. The back window was blown out, crystal slivers of\nglass all around him on the back lawn. \"*Mimi!*\"\n\nBilly was at his side, holding something. A knife. The knife. Serrated\nedge. Sharp. Cracked handle wound with knotted twine, but as he reached\nfor it, it wasn't cracked. It was the under-the-pillow knife, the wings\nknife, Krishna's knife.\n\n\"You forgot this,\" he said, taking the PDA.\n\nThen Davey was in the yard. He cocked his head and eyed the knife\nwarily.\n\n\"Where'd you get that?\" he said.\n\nAdam shifted his grip for slashing, and took one step forward, stamping\nhis foot down as he did it. Davey retreated a step, then took two steps\nforward.\n\n\"He set the fires,\" Bentley said. \"She's as good as dead. Cooked. Won't\nbe long now, she'll be cooked.\"\n\nDarren looked at him for the first time. \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"That's\nabout right. I never found you, no matter how I looked. You don't get\nfound if you don't want to.\"\n\nBrent shook his head. \"He set the fire, he used gasoline. Up the stairs,\nso it would spread up every floor quickly.\"\n\nAaron growled and lunged forward, slicing wildly, but Davey's scurry was\nsurprising and fast and nimble.\n\n\"You're going to stab me again, cut me again? What do you suppose that\nwill get you?\"\n\n\"He's weaker than he was, then. We got six years, then. He's\nweaker. We'll get ten years. Twenty.\" Billy was hopping from foot to\nfoot. \"*Do it*.\"\n\nAlan sliced and stabbed again, and the knife's point caught Danny's\nlittle bandy leg, like cutting through a loaf of stale bread, and Danny\ngasped and hopped back another step.\n\n\"He gave you the knife, didn't he? He gave you the knife last time. Last\ntime, he took me to the school yard and showed me you and your\ngirlfriend. He explained all about girlfriends to me and about what it\nwould mean once our secret was out. He taught me the words, taught me to\nsay *pervert*. Remember, Billy? Remember how you taught me?\"\n\nAndrew hesitated.\n\n\"He taught me the ritual with your thumbtip, how to make the little you,\nand then he took it away from me for safekeeping. He kept it in one of\nhis rabbit cages, around on the other side of the mountain. It's not\nthere now. Have you seen it? Does he still have it?\n\n\"He never liked having a little brother, not me or the others, but he\nliked having that little thing around to torture.\"\n\nBilly hissed. \"She'll be dead in minutes,\" he said. \"In seconds. Another\none dead. His doing!\n\n\"Killed her, cut her up, buried her,\" Benny chanted. \"Sliced her open\nand cut her up,\" he shrilled.\n\nAlan let the knife fall from his hands. Benny leapt for Danny, hands\noutstretched. Danny braced for the impact, rolled with him, and came up\non top of him, small hands in Benny's eyes, grinding.\n\nThere were sirens out front now, lots of sirens.\n\nA distant crash, and a rain of glass fell about his shoulders. He turned\nand looked up, looked up into the dormer window of his attic, four\nstories up. Mimi's head poked out from the window, wreathed in smoke,\nher face smudged and eyes screwed up.\n\n\"Mimi!\" he cried.\n\nShe climbed unsteadily onto the windowsill, perched there for a\nmoment. Then she leaned forward, ducked her head, and slipped into the\nsky.\n\nHer magnificent wings unfolded in the smoke, in the hot ash, in the\nsmoldering remains of all of Alan's life in human society. Her\nmagnificent wings unfolded and caught the air with a sound he heard and\nwith a downdraft of warm air that blew his hair off his forehead like a\nlover's hand, smoky smell and spicy smell.\n\nShe flew.\n\nThe sirens grew louder and she swooped over the yard. She gave two\npowerful beats of her wings and rose higher than the roof, then she\ncircled the yard in great loops, coming lower and lower with each\npass. Davey and Benny watched her. Kurt watched her.\n\nAlan watched her. She was coming straight for him. He held out his arms\nand she fell into them, enfolding them both in her wings, her great and\nglorious wings.\n\n\"Come on,\" she said. Kurt was already limping for the alley. Benny and\nDavid had already melted away. They were alone in the yard, and the\nsirens were so loud now, and there were the reflections of emergency\nlights bouncing off the smoke around them. \"Come on,\" she said, and she\nput her arms around his waist, locking her wrists.\n\nIt took five beats of her wings to get them aloft, and they barely\ncleared the fence, but they banked low over the alley and she beat her\nwings again and then they were gaining altitude, catching an updraft\nfrom the burning house on Wales Avenue, rising so high into the sky that\nhe felt like they would fly to the moon.\n\n#\n\nThe day that Lyman and Kurt were on the cover of NOW magazine, they\ndropped by Martian Signal to meet with Natalie's boss. Lyman carried the\npitch package, color-matched, polyethnic, edgy and cool, with great\ncopy.\n\nNatalie met them. She'd grown out her hair and wore it with bangs\nhanging over the scar on her forehead, just over her left eye, two\npunctures with little dents. Three surgeries had cleared all the bone\nfragments from the orbit of that eye, and she'd kept her sight. Once she\nwas out of the hospital, she quickly became the best employee Martian\nSignal had ever had. She quickly became manager. She quickly undertook\nto make several improvements in the daily operations of the store that\nincreased turnover by 30 percent. She slowly and reluctantly hired her\nbrother, but his gimpy knee made it hard for him to bend down to\nreshelve, and he quickly quit.\n\nKurt and Natalie hugged, and Lyman formally shook her hand, and then\nshook her boss's hand.\n\nIt took less than an hour to convince her boss to let them put up their\naccess point. On the way back, three different people stopped them and\ntold them how much they liked the article, and swore that the first\nthing they'd do when they got home would be to open up their networks\nand rename them ParasiteNet.\n\nLyman handled the thank-you's for this, and Kurt smiled and fiddled with\nhis PDA and watched the sky, looking for a girl with wings as wide as a\nhouse.\n\n#\n\nI went to the house,\n\n(she said, as he tended the fire, turning the yams in the coals and\nstirring the pot in which his fish stew bubbled)\n\nI went to the house,\n\n(she said, resting up from the long flight she'd flown from Toronto to\nCraig's distant, warm shores, far away from Kensington Market and\nKrishna and Billy and Danny)\n\nI went to the house,\n\n(she said, and Andy worked hard to keep the grin off his face, for he'd\nbeen miserable during her long absence and now he could scarcely contain\nhis delight)\n\nI went to the house, and there was no one home. I had the address you'd\ngiven me, and it was just like you'd described it to me, down to the\nbasketball hoop in the driveway.\n\nIt was empty. But it was as I'd remembered it. They'd lived there. I'd\nlived there. You were right, that was the house.\n\nThat was the house I'd lived in. I rang the doorbell, then I peeked in\nthrough a crack in the blinds. The rooms were empty. No furniture. Just\nblinds. It was night, and no one was looking, so I flew up to the third\nfloor, to the window I'd stared out all those times.\n\nThe window was unlatched, and I slid aside the screen and let myself\nin. The room was empty. No carpet. No frilly bed and stuffed animals. No\ndesk. No clothes in the closet, no hangers.\n\nThe only thing in the room was a small box, plugged into the wall, with\na network cable snaking away into the phone jack. It had small lights on\nit, blinking. It was like the one you'd had in your attic. A wireless\naccess point.\n\nI remembered their names, then. Oliver and Patricia. They'd been my\nmother and father for a few years. Set me up with my first\napartment. This had been their house.\n\nI slept there that day, then, come nightfall, I set out again to come\nhome to you.\n\n#\n\nSomething woke Andy from his sound sleep, nestled in her wings, in her\narms. A tread on Craig's inviolable soil, someone afoot on his brother.\n\nSlowly, he got himself loose of Mimi and sat up and looked around.\n\nThe golem standing before him was small, and its eyes glowed red. It\nbent over and set something down on the earth, a fur-wrapped bundle of\nsmoked meat.\n\nIt nodded at him. He nodded back.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said.\n\nMimi put her hand on his calf. \"Is it okay?\"\n\n\"It's right,\" he said. \"Just as it was meant to be.\"\n\nHe returned to her arms and they kissed. \"No falling in love,\" she said.\n\n\"Perish the thought,\" he said.\n\nShe bit his lip and he bit hers and they kissed again, and then he was\nasleep, and at peace.\n\n\n=== Bio ===\n\nCanadian-born Cory Doctorow (craphound.com) is the European Affairs\ncoordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (eff.org).

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/gutenberg\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n","id":1034,"split":"train"}
