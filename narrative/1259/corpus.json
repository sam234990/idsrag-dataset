{"ori_id":"6dede499df79827ea44d634f07b998b90ee4a05d","title":"The Lure of the Mask","context":"The Lure of the Mask\n A 1908 review of the book summarizes the light plot of the story in overenthusiastic fashion:\nThe story opens with a jump--literally. A young New Yorker, rich, of course, hears from his window on a night of fog and mist a woman's voice singing divinely. He falls in love with it head over heels and he falls downstairs in about the same way, he is such a hurry to see the singer. But by the time her reaches the street, lo! she has vanished, and only a policeman remains. Late on, this young, adventurous Mr. Hillard again meets the young, adventurous singer under most mystifying circumstances. They dine together, but she comes in mask. What the voice has begun, the masks puts the finishing touches to. From then on Hillard is full forty fathoms deep in love and curiosity. Then the scene shifts to Italy, with the shifting fortunes of an American comic opera company, stranded at Venice. The beautiful singer becomes the prima donna of this company. The soubrette is one Kitty Killigrew, and around her flourishes a most enticing, exciting and enlivening subplot. She dances her way straight into your heart. Amusing things happen at Venice. Thrilling things happen at Monte Carlo. At Florence the climax is reached, and it makes you fairly gasp with its intense interest. At Bellaggio, the loveliest of lovely spots in the land of love, the curtain goes down on happy lovers.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Lure of the Mask, by Harold MacGrath\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Hillard,\ngenuinely astonished, lowered his pipe and listened. To sit dreaming by\nan open window, even in this unlovely first month of the year, in that\ngrim unhandsome city which boasts of its riches and still accepts with\nsmug content its rows upon rows of ugly architecture, to sit dreaming,\nthen, of red-tiled roofs, of cloud-caressed hills, of terraced\nvineyards, of cypresses in their dark aloofness, is not out of the\nnatural order of things; but that into this idle and pleasant dream\nthere should enter so divine a voice, living, feeling, pulsing, this was\nnot ordinary at all.\n\nAnd Hillard was glad that the room was in darkness. He rose eagerly and\npeered out. But he saw no one. Across the street the arc-lamp burned\ndimly, like an opal in the matrix, while of architectural outlines not\none remained, the fog having kindly obliterated them.\n\nThe Voice rose and sank and soared again, drawing nearer and nearer. It\nwas joyous and unrestrained, and there was youth in it, the touch of\nspring and the breath of flowers. The music was Lecocq's, that is to\nsay, French; but the tongue was of a country which Hillard knew to be\nthe garden of the world. Presently he observed a shadow emerge from the\nyellow mist, to come within the circle of light, which, faint as it was,\nlimned in against the nothingness beyond the form of a woman. She walked\ndirectly under his window.\n\nAs the invisible comes suddenly out of the future to assume distinct\nproportions which either make or mar us, so did this unknown cantatrice\ncome out of the fog that night and enter into Hillard's life, to\nreadjust its ambitions, to divert its aimless course, to give impetus to\nit, and a directness which hitherto it had not known.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nHe leaned over the sill at a perilous angle, the bright coal of his pipe\nspilling comet-wise to the area-way below. He was only subconscious of\nhaving spoken; but this syllable was sufficient to spoil the\nenchantment. The Voice ceased abruptly, with an odd break. The singer\nlooked up. Possibly her astonishment surpassed even that of her\naudience. For a few minutes she had forgotten that she was in New York,\nwhere romance may be found only in the book-shops; she had forgotten\nthat it was night, a damp and chill forlorn night; she had forgotten the\npain in her heart; there had been only a great and irresistible longing\nto sing.\n\nThough she raised her face, he could distinguish no feature, for the\nlight was behind. However, he was a man who made up his mind quickly.\nBrunette or blond, beautiful or otherwise, it needed but a moment to\nfind out. Even as this decision was made he was in the upper hall,\ntaking the stairs two at a bound. He ran out into the night, bareheaded.\nUp the street he saw a flying shadow. Plainly she had anticipated his\nimpulse and the curiosity behind it. Even as he gave chase the shadow\nmelted in the fog, as ice melts in running waters, as flame dissolves in\nsunshine. She was gone. He cupped his ear with his hand; in vain, there\ncame no sound as of pattering feet; there was nothing but fog and\nsilence.\n\n\"Well, if this doesn't beat the Dutch!\" he murmured.\n\nHe laughed disappointedly. It did not matter that he was three and\nthirty; he still retained youth enough to feel chagrined at such a\ntrivial defeat. Here had been something like a genuine adventure, and it\nhad slipped like water through his clumsy fingers.\n\n\"Deuce take the fog! But for that I'd have caught her.\"\n\nBut reason promptly asked him what he should have done had he caught the\nsinger. Yes, supposing he had, what excuse would he have had to offer?\nDenial on her part would have been simple, and righteous indignation at\nbeing accosted on the street simpler still. He had not seen her face,\nand doubtless she was aware of this fact. Thus, she would have had all\nthe weapons for defense and he not one for attack. But though reason\nargued well, it did not dislodge his longing. He would have been\nperfectly happy to have braved her indignation for a single glance at\nher face. He walked back, lighting his pipe. Who could she be? What\npeculiar whimsical freak had sent her singing past his window at one\no'clock of the morning? A grand opera singer, returning home from a late\nsupper? But he dismissed this opinion even as he advanced it. He knew\nsomething about grand opera singers. They attend late suppers, it is\ntrue, but they ride home in luxurious carriages and never risk their\ngolden voices in this careless if romantic fashion. And in New York\nnobody took the trouble to serenade anybody else, unless paid in advance\nand armed with a police permit. As for being a comic-opera star, he\nrefused to admit the possibility; and he relegated this well-satisfied\nconstellation to the darks of limbo. He had heard a Voice.\n\nA vast, shadow loomed up in the middle of the street, presently to take\nupon itself the solid outlines of a policeman who came lumbering over to\nadd or subtract his quota of interest in the affair. Hillard wisely\nstopped and waited for him, pulling up the collar of his jacket, as he\nbegan to note that there was a winter's tang to the fog.\n\n\"Hi, what's all this?\" the policeman called out roughly.\n\n\"To what do you refer?\" Hillard counter-questioned, puffing. He slipped\nhis hands into the pockets of his jacket.\n\n\"I heard a woman singin', that's what!\" explained the guardian of the\nlaw.\n\n\"So did I.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did, huh?\"\n\n\"Certainly. It is patent that my ears are as good as yours.\"\n\n\"Huh! See her?\"\n\n\"For a moment,\" Hillard admitted.\n\n\"Well, we can't have none o' this in the streets. It's disorderly.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Hillard, rather annoyed at the policeman's tone, \"you\ndon't think for an instant that I was directing this operetta?\"\n\n\"Think? Where's your hat?\"\n\nHillard ran his hand over his head. The policeman had him here. \"I did\nnot bring it out.\"\n\n\"Too warm and summery; huh? It don't look good. I've been watchin' these\nparts fer a leddy. They call her Leddy Lightfinger; an' she has some O'\nthe gents done to a pulp when it comes to liftin' jools an' trinkets.\nSomebody fergits to lock the front door, an' she finds it out. Why did\nyou come out without yer lid?\"\n\n\"Just forgot it, that's all.\"\n\n\"Which way'd she go?\"\n\n\"You'll need a map and a search-light. I started to run after her\nmyself. I heard a voice from my window; I saw a woman; I made for the\nstreet; _niente_!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"_Niente_, nothing!\"\n\n\"Oh! I see; Dago. Seems to me now that this woman was singin' I-taly-an,\ntoo.\" They were nearing the light, and the policeman gazed intently at\nthe hatless young man. \"Why, it's Mr. Hillard! I'm surprised. Well,\nwell! Some day I'll run in a bunch o' these chorus leddies, jes' fer a\nlesson. They git lively at the restaurants over on Broadway, an' thin\nthey raise the dead with their singin', which, often as not, is anythin'\nbut singin'. An' here it is, after one.\"\n\n\"But this was not a chorus lady,\" replied Hillard, thoughtfully reaching\ninto his vest for a cigar.\n\n\"Sure, an' how do you know?\" with renewed suspicions.\n\n\"The lady had a singing voice.\"\n\n\"Huh! They all think alike about that. But mebbe she wasn't bad at the\nbusiness. Annyhow....\"\n\n\"It was rather out of time and place, eh?\" helpfully.\n\n\"That's about the size of it. This Leddy Lightfinger is a case. She has\nus all thinkin' on our nights off. Clever an' edjicated, an' jabbers in\nhalf a dozen tongues. It's a thousan' to the man who jugs her. But she\ndon't sing; at least, they ain't any report to that effect. Perhaps your\nleddy was jes' larkin' a bit. But it's got to be stopped.\"\n\nHillard passed over the cigar, and the policeman bit off the end,\nnodding with approval at such foresight. The young man then proffered\nthe coal of his pipe and the policeman took his light therefrom,\nrealizing that after such a peace-offering there was nothing for him to\ndo but move on. Yet on dismal lonesome nights, like this one, it is a\ngodsend and a comfort to hear one's own voice against the darkness. So\nhe lingered.\n\n\"Didn't get a peep at her face?\"\n\n\"Not a single feature. The light was behind her.\" Hillard tapped one toe\nand then the other.\n\n\"An' how was she dressed?\"\n\n\"In fog, for all I could see.\"\n\n\"On the level now, didn't you know who she was?\" The policeman gave\nHillard a sly dig in the ribs with his club.\n\n\"On my word!\"\n\n\"Some swell, mebbe.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly a lady. That's why it looks odd, why it brought me into the\nstreet. She sang in classic Italian. And what's more, for the privilege\nof hearing that voice again, I should not mind sitting on this cold curb\ntill the milkman comes around in the morning.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't be fer long,\" laughed the policeman, taking out his watch\nand holding it close to the end of his cigar. \"Twenty minutes after one.\nWell, I must be gittin' back to me beat. An' you'd better be goin' in;\nit's cold. Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" Hillard responded cheerfully.\n\n\"Say, what's I-taly-an fer good night?\" still reluctant to go on.\n\n\"_Buona notte._\"\n\n\"Bony notty; huh, sounds like Chinese fer rheumatism. Been to Italy?\"\n\n\"I was born there,\" patiently.\n\n\"No! Why, you're no Dago!\"\n\n\"Not so much as an eyelash. The stork happened to drop the basket there,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Ha! I see. Well, Ameriky is good enough fer me an' mine,\" complacently.\n\n\"I dare say!\"\n\n\"An' if this stogy continues t' behave, we'll say no more about the\nvanishin' leddy.\" And with this the policeman strolled off into the fog,\nhis suspicions in nowise removed. He knew many rich young bachelors like\nHillard. If it wasn't a chorus lady, it was a prima donna, which was not\nfar in these degenerate days from being the same thing.\n\nHillard regained his room and leaned with his back to the radiator. He\nhad an idea. It was rather green and salad, but as soon as his hands\nwere warm he determined to put this idea into immediate use. The Voice\nhad stirred him deeply, stirred him with the longing to hear it again,\nto see the singer's face, to learn what extraordinary impulse had loosed\nthe song. Perhaps it was his unspoken loneliness striving to call out\nagainst this self-imposed isolation; for he was secretly lonely, as all\nbachelors must be who have passed the Rubicon of thirty. He made no\nanalysis of this new desire, or rather this old desire, newly awakened.\nHe embraced it gratefully. Such is the mystery and power of the human\nvoice: this one, passing casually under his window, had awakened him.\n\nNever the winter came with its weary round of rain and fog and snow that\nhis heart and mind did not fly over the tideless southern sea to the\nland of his birth if not of his blood. Sorrento, that jewel of the ruddy\nclifts! There was fog outside his window, and yet how easy it was to\npicture the turquoise bay of Naples shimmering in the morning light!\nThere was Naples itself, like a string of its own pink coral, lying\ncrescent-wise on the distant strand; there were the snowcaps fading on\nthe far horizon; the bronzed fishermen and their wives, a sheer two\nhundred feet below him, pulling in their glistening nets; the amethyst\nisles of Capri and Ischia eternally hanging midway between the blue of\nthe sky and the blue of the sea; and there, towering menacingly above\nall this melting beauty, the dark, grim pipe of Vulcan. How easily,\nindeed, he could see all these things!\n\nWith a quick gesture of both hands, Latin, always Latin, he crossed the\nroom to a small writing-desk, turned on the lights and sat down. He\nsmiled as he took up the pen to begin his composition. Not one chance in\na thousand. And after several attempts he realized that the letter he\nhad in mind was not the simplest to compose. There were a dozen futile\nefforts before he produced anything like satisfaction. Then he filled\nout a small check. A little later he stole down-stairs, round the corner\nto the local branch of the post-office, and returned. It was only a\nblind throw, such as dicers sometimes make in the dark. But chance loves\nher true gamester, and to him she makes a faithful servant.\n\n\"I should be sorely tempted,\" he mused, picking up a novel and selecting\na comfortable angle in the Morris, \"I should be sorely tempted to call\nany other man a silly ass. Leddy Lightfinger--it would be a fine joke if\nmy singer turned out to be that irregular person.\"\n\nHe fell to reading, but it was not long before he yawned. He shied the\nbook into a corner, drew off his boots and cast them into the hall. A\nmoment after his valet appeared, gathered up the boots, tucked them\nunder his arm, and waited.\n\n\"I want nothing, Giovanni. I have only been around to the post-office.\"\n\n\"I heard the door open and close four times, signore.\"\n\n\"It was I each time. If this fog does not change into rain, I shall want\nmy riding-breeches to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"It is always raining here,\" Giovanni remarked sadly.\n\n\"Not always; there are pleasant days in the spring and summer. It is\nbecause this is not Italy. The Hollander wonders how any reasonable\nbeing can dwell in a country where they do not drink gin. It's home,\nGiovanni; rain pelts you from a different angle here. There is nothing\nmore; you may go. It is two o'clock, and you are dead for sleep.\"\n\nBut Giovanni only bowed; he did not stir.\n\n\"Well?\" inquired his master.\n\n\"It is seven years now, signore.\"\n\n\"So it is; seven this coming April.\"\n\n\"I am now a citizen of this country; I obey its laws; I vote.\"\n\n\"Yes, Giovanni, you are an American citizen, and you should be proud of\nit.\"\n\nGiovanni smiled. \"I may return to my good Italia without danger.\"\n\n\"That depends. If you do not run across any official who recognizes\nyou.\"\n\nGiovanni spread his hands. \"Official memory seldom lasts so long as\nseven years. The signore has crossed four times in this period.\"\n\n\"I would gladly have taken you each time, as you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! But in two or three years the police do not forget. In seven\nit is different.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Hillard was beginning to understand the trend of this\nconversation. \"So, then, you wish to return?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore. I have saved a little money,\" modestly.\n\n\"A little?\" Hillard laughed. \"For seven years you have received fifty\nAmerican dollars every month, and out of it you do not spend as many\ncopper centesimi. I am certain that you have twenty thousand lire tucked\naway in your stocking; a fortune!\"\n\n\"I buy the blacking for the signore's boots,\" gravely.\n\nHillard saw the twinkle in the black eyes. \"I have never,\" he said\ntruthfully, \"asked you to black my boots.\"\n\n\"Penance, signore, penance for my sins; and I am not without gratitude.\nThere was a time when I had rather cut off a hand than black a boot; but\nall that is changed. We of the Sabine Hills are proud, as the signore\nknows. We are Romans out there; we despise the cities; and we do not\nhold out our palms for the traveler's pennies. I am a peasant, but\nalways remember the blood of the C\u00c3\u00a6sars. Who can say? Besides, I have\nheld a sword for the church. I owe no allegiance to the puny House of\nSavoy!\" There was no twinkle in the black eyes now; there was a\nferocious gleam. It died away quickly, however; the squared shoulders\ndrooped, and there was a deprecating shrug. \"Pardon, signore; this is\nfar away from the matter of boots. I grow boastful; I am an old man and\nshould know better. But does the signore return to Italy in the spring?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Giovanni, I don't know. But what's on your mind?\"\n\n\"Nothing new, signore,\" with eyes cast down to hide the returning\nlights.\n\n\"You are a bloodthirsty ruffian!\" said Hillard shortly. \"Will time never\nsoften the murder in your heart?\"\n\n\"I am as the good God made me. I have seen through blood, and time can\nnot change that. Besides, the Holy Father will do something for one who\nfought for the cause.\"\n\n\"He will certainly not countenance bloodshed, Giovanni.\"\n\n\"He can absolve it. And as you say, I am rich, as riches go in the\nSabine Hills.\"\n\n\"I was in hopes you had forgotten.\"\n\n\"Forgotten? The signore will never understand; it is his father's blood.\nShe was so pretty and youthful, eye of my eye, heart of my heart! And\ninnocent! She sang like the nightingale. She was always happy. Up with\nthe dawn, to sleep with the stars. We were alone, she and I. The sheep\nsupported me and she sold her roses and dried lavender. It was all so\nbeautiful ... till he came. Ah, had he loved her! But a plaything, a\npastime! The signore never had a daughter. What is she now? A nameless\nthing in the streets!\" Giovanni raised his arms tragically; the hoots\nclattered to the floor. \"Seven years! It is a long time for one of my\nblood to wait.\"\n\n\"Enough!\" cried Hillard; but there was a hardness in his throat at the\nsight of the old man's tears. Where was the proud and stately man, the\nblack-bearded shepherd in faded blue linen, in picturesque garters, with\nhis reed-like pipe, that he, Hillard, had known in his boyhood days?\nSurely not here. Giovanni had known the great wrong, but Hillard could\nnot in conscience's name foster the spirit which demanded an eye for an\neye. So he said: \"I can give you only my sympathy for your loss, but I\nabhor the spirit of revenge which can not find satisfaction in anything\nsave murder.\"\n\nGiovanni once more picked up the boots. \"I shall leave the signore in\nthe spring.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said Hillard gently.\n\nGiovanni bowed gravely and made off with his boots. Hillard remained\nstaring thoughtfully at the many-colored squares in the rug under his\nfeet. It would be lonesome with Giovanni gone. The old man had evidently\nmade up his mind.... But the Woman with the Voice, would she see the\nnotice in the paper? And if she did, would she reply to it? What a\nfoundation for a romance!... Bah! He prepared for bed.\n\nTo those who reckon earthly treasures as the only thing worth having,\nJohn Hillard was a fortunate young man. That he was without kith or kin\nwas considered by many as an additional piece of good fortune. Born in\nSorrento, in one of the charming villas which sweep down to the very\nbrow of the cliffs, educated in Rome up to his fifteenth year; taken at\nthat age from the dreamy, drifting land and thrust into the noisy,\nbustling life which was his inheritance; fatherless and motherless at\ntwenty; a college youth who was for ever mixing his Italian with his\nEnglish and being laughed at; hating tumult and loving quiet;\nwarm-hearted and impulsive, yet meeting only habitual reserve from his\ncompatriots whichever way he turned; it is not to be wondered at that he\npreferred the land of his birth to that of his blood.\n\nAll this might indicate an artistic temperament, the ability to do petty\nthings grandly; but Hillard had escaped this. He loved his Raphaels, his\nTitians, his Veroneses, his Rubenses, without any desire to make\nindifferent copies of them; he admired his Dante, his Petrarch, his\nGoldoni, without the wish to imitate them. He was full of sentiment\nwithout being sentimental, a poet who thought but never indited verses.\nHis father's blood was in his veins, that is to say, the salt of\nrestraint; thus, his fortune grew and multiplied. The strongest and\nreddest corpuscle had been the gift of his mother. She had left him the\nlegacy of loving all beautiful things in moderation, the legacy of\ngentleness, of charity, of strong loves and frank hatreds, of humor, of\nliving out in the open, of dreaming great things and accomplishing none\nof them.\n\nThe old house in which he lived was not in the fashionable quarter of\nthe town; but that did not matter. Nor did it vary externally from any\nof its unpretentious neighbors. Inside, however, there were treasures\npriceless and unique. There was no woman in the household; he might\nsmoke in any room he pleased. A cook, a butler, and a valet were the\nsum-total of his retinue. In appearance he resembled many another\nclean-cut, clean-living American gentleman.\n\nGiovanni sought his own room at the end of the hall, squatted on a low\nstool and solemnly began the business of blacking his master's boots. He\nwas still as lean and tall as a Lombardy poplar, this handsome old\nRoman. His hair was white; there was now no black beard on his face,\nwhich was as brown and creased as Spanish levant; and some of the\nfullness was gone from his chest and arms; but for all that he carried\nhis fifty-odd years lightly. He worked swiftly to-night, but his mind\nwas far away from his task.\n\nThere was a pitiful story, commonplace enough. A daughter, a\nloose-living officer, a knife flung from a dark alley, and sudden flight\nto the south. Hillard had found him wandering through the streets of\nNaples, hiding from the _carabinieri_ as best he could. Hillard\ncontrived to smuggle him on the private yacht of a friend. He found a\npeasant who was reconsidering the advisability of digging sewers and\nlaying railroad ties in the Eldorado of the West. A few pieces of\nsilver, and the passport changed hands. With this Giovanni blandly lied\nhis way into the United States. After due time he applied for\ncitizenship, and through Hillard's influence it was accorded him. He\nsolemnly voted when elections came round, and hoarded his wages, like\nthe thrifty man he was. Some day he would return to Rome, or Naples, or\nVenice, or Florence, as the case might be; and then!\n\nWhen the boots shone flawlessly, he carried them to Hillard's door and\nsoftly tiptoed back. He put his face against the cold window. He, too,\nhad heard the Voice. How his heart hurt him with its wild hope! But only\nfor a moment. It was not the voice he hungered for. The words were\nItalian, but he knew that the woman who sang them was not!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOBJECT, MATRIMONY\n\n\nWinter fogs in New York are never quite so intolerable as their\ncounterparts in London; and while their frequency is a matter of\ncomplaint, their duration is seldom of any length. So, by the morrow a\nstrong wind from the west had winnowed the skies and cleared the sun.\nThere was an exhilarating tingle of frost in the air and a visible rime\non the windows. Hillard, having breakfasted lightly, was standing with\nhis back to the grate in the cozy breakfast-room. He was in boots and\nbreeches and otherwise warmly clad, and freshly shaven. He rocked on his\nheels and toes, and ran his palm over his blue-white chin in search of a\npossible slip of the razor.\n\nGiovanni came in to announce that he had telephoned, and that the\nsignore's brown mare would be at the park entrance precisely at\nhalf-after eight. Giovanni still marveled over this wonderful voice\nwhich came out of nowhere, but he was no longer afraid of it. The\ncuriosity which is innate and child-like in all Latins soon overcame his\ndark superstitions. He was an ardent Catholic and believed that a few\nmiracles should be left in the hands of God. The telephone had now\nbecome a kind of plaything, and Hillard often found him in front of it,\npatiently waiting for the bell to ring.\n\nThe facility with which Giovanni had mastered English amazed his teacher\nand master; but now he needed no more lessons, the two when alone\ntogether spoke Giovanni's tongue: Hillard, because he loved it, and\nGiovanni because the cook spoke it badly and the English butler not at\nall.\n\n\"You have made up your mind to go, then, _amico_?\" said Hillard.\n\n\"Yes, signore.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall miss you. To whom shall I talk the tongue I love so well,\nwhen Giovanni is gone?\" with a lightness which he did not feel. Hillard\nhad grown very fond of the old Roman in these seven years.\n\n\"Whenever the signore goes to Italia, he shall find me. It needs but a\nword to bring me to him. The signore will pardon me, but he is\nlike--like a son.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Giovanni. By the way, did you hear a woman singing in the\nstreet last night?\"\n\n\"Yes. At first--\" Giovanni hesitated.\n\n\"Ah, but that could not be, Giovanni; that could not be.\"\n\n\"No, it could not be. But she sang well!\" the old servant ventured.\n\n\"So thought I. I even ran out into the street to find out who she was;\nbut she vanished like the lady in the conjurer's trick. But it seemed to\nme that, while she sang in Italian, she herself was not wholly of that\nrace.\"\n\n\"_Buonissima!_\" Giovanni struck a noiseless brava with his hands. \"Have\nI not always said that the signore's ears are as sharp as my own? No,\nthe voice was very beautiful, but it was not truly Roman. It was more\nlike they talk in Venice. And yet the sound of the voice decided me. The\nhills have always been calling to me; and I must answer.\"\n\n\"And the unforgetting _carabinieri_?\"\n\n\"Oh, I must take my chance,\" with the air of a fatalist.\n\n\"What shall you do?\"\n\n\"I have my two hands, signore. Besides, the signore has said it; I am\nrich.\" Giovanni permitted a smile to stir his thin lips. \"Yes, I must go\nback. Your people have been good to me and have legally made me one of\nthem, but my heart is never here. It is always so cold and every one\nmoves so quickly. You can not lie down in the sun. Your police, bah!\nThey beat you on the feet. You remember when I fell asleep on the steps\nof the cathedral? They thought I was drunk, and would have arrested me!\"\n\n\"Everybody must keep moving here; it is the penalty of being rich.\"\n\n\"And I am lonesome for my kind. I have nothing in common with these\nherds of Sicilians and Neapolitans who pour into the streets from the\nwharves.\" Giovanni spoke scornfully.\n\n\"Yet in war time the Neapolitans sheltered your pope.\"\n\n\"Vanity! They wished to make an impression on the rest of the world. It\nis dull here, besides. There is no joy in the shops. I am lost in these\ngreat palaces. The festa is lacking. Nobody bargains; nobody sees the\nproprietor; you find your way to the streets alone. The butcher says\nthat his meat is so-and-so, and you pay; the grocer marks his tins\nsuch-and-such, and you do not question; and the baker says that, and you\npay, pay, pay! What? I need a collar; it is _quindici_--fifteen you say!\nI offer _quattordici_. I would give interest to the sale. But no! The\ncollar goes back into the box. I pay _quindici_, or I go without. It is\nthe same everywhere; very dull, dead, lifeless.\"\n\nHillard was moved to laughter. He very well understood the old man's\nlament. In Italy, if there is one thing more than another that pleases\nthe native it is to make believe to himself that he has got the better\nof a bargain. A shrewd purchase enlivens the whole day; it is talked\nabout, laughed over, and becomes the history of the day that Tomass', or\nPietro, or Paoli, or whatever his name may be, has bested the merchant\nout of some twenty centesimi.\n\n\"And the cook and the butler,\" concluded Giovanna; \"we do not get on\nwell.\"\n\n\"It is because they are in mortal fear of you, you brigand! Well, my\ncoat and cap.\"\n\nHillard presently left the house and hailed a Fifth Avenue omnibus. He\nlooked with negative interest at the advertisements, at the people in\nthe streets, at his fellow-travelers. One of these was hidden behind his\nmorning paper. _Personals._ Hillard squirmed a little. The world never\nholds very much romance in the sober morning. What a stupid piece of\nfolly! The idea of his sending that personal inquiry to the paper!\nTo-morrow he would see it sandwiched in between samples of shop-girl\nromance, questionable intrigues, and divers search-warrants. Ye gods!\n\"Will the blonde who smiled at gentleman in blue serge, elevated train,\nTuesday, meet same in park? Object, matrimony.\" Hillard fidgeted. \"Young\nman known as Adonis would adore stout elderly lady, independently\nsituated. Object, matrimony.\" Pish! \"Girlie. Can't keep appointment\nto-night. Willie.\" Tush! \"A French Widow of eighteen, unencumbered,\" and\nso forth and so on. Rot, bally rot; and here he was on the way to join\nthem! \"Will the lady who sang from _Madame Angot_ communicate with\ngentleman who leaned out of the window? J.H. Burgomaster Club.\"\nPositively asinine! The man opposite folded the paper and stuffed it\ninto his pocket, and its disappearance relieved Hillard somewhat.\n\nThere was scarce one chance in a thousand of the mysterious singer's\nseeing the inquiry, not one in ten thousand of her answering it. And the\nfolly of giving his club address! That would look very dignified in\nyonder agony column! And then he brightened. He could withdraw it; and\nhe would do so the very first thing when he went down-town to the\noffice. \"Object, matrimony!\" If the woman saw it she would only laugh.\nIt was all a decent woman could do. And certainly the woman of the past\nnight's adventure was of high degree, educated; and doubtless the spirit\nwhich had prompted the song was as inexplicable to her this morning as\nit had been to him last night. He had lost none of the desire to meet\nher, but reason made it plain to him that a meeting could not possibly\nbe arranged through any personal column in the newspaper. He would\ncancel the thing.\n\nHe dropped from the omnibus at the park entrance, where he found his\nrestive mare. He gave her a lump of sugar and climbed into the saddle.\nHe directed the groom to return for the horse at ten o'clock, then\nheaded for the bridle-path. It was heavy, but the air was so keen and\nbracing that neither the man nor the horse worried about the going.\nThere were a dozen or so early riders besides himself, and in and out\nthe winding path they passed and repassed, walking, trotting, cantering.\nOnly one party attracted him: a riding master and a trio of brokers who\nwere verging on embonpoint, and were desperate and looked it. They stood\nin a fair way of losing several pounds that morning. A good rider always\nsmiles at the sight of a poor one, when a little retrospection should\nmake him rather pitying. Hillard went on. The park was not lovely; the\ntrees were barren, the grass yellow and sodden, and here and there were\ngrimy cakes of unmelted snow.\n\n\"She is so innocent, so youthful!\"\n\nHe found himself humming the refrain over and over. She had sung it with\nabandon, tenderness, lightness. For one glimpse of her face! He took the\nrise and dip which followed. Perhaps a hundred yards ahead a solitary\nwoman cantered easily along. Hillard had not seen her before. He spurred\nforward, only faintly curious. She proved to be a total stranger. There\nwas nothing familiar to his eye in her figure, which was charming. She\nrode well. As he drew nearer he saw that she wore a heavy grey veil. And\nthis veil hid everything but the single flash of a pair of eyes the\ncolor of which defied him. Then he looked at her mount. Ha! there was\nonly one rangy black with a white throat; from the Sandford stables, he\nwas positive. But the Sandfords were at this moment in Cairo, so it\nsignified nothing. There is always some one ready to exercise your\nhorses, if they happen to be showy ones. He looked again at the rider;\nthe flash of the eyes was not repeated; so his interest vanished, and he\nurged the mare into a sharp run. Twice in the course of the ride he\npassed her, but her head never turned. He knew it did not because he\nturned to see.\n\nSo he went back to his tentative romance. She had passed his window and\ndisappeared into the fog, and there was a reasonable doubt of her ever\nreturning from it. The Singer in the Fog; thus he would write it down in\nhis book of memories and sensibly turn the page. Once down-town he would\ncountermand his order, and that would be the end of it. At length he\ncame back to the entrance and surrendered the mare. He was about to\ncross the square, when he was hailed.\n\n\"Hello, Jack! I say, Hillard!\"\n\nHillard wheeled and saw Merrihew. He, too, was in riding-breeches.\n\n\"Why, Dan, glad to see you. Were you in the park?\"\n\n\"Riverside. Beastly cold, too. Come into the Plaza and join me in a cup\nof good coffee.\"\n\n\"Had breakfast long ago, boy.\"\n\n\"Oh, just one cup! I'm lonesome.\"\n\n\"That's no inducement; but I'll join you,\" replied Hillard cheerfully.\n\nThe two entered the caf\u00c3\u00a9, sat down, and Merrihew ordered Mocha.\n\n\"How are you behaving yourself these days?\" asked Merrihew. He drank\nmore coffee and smoked more cigars than were good for him. He was always\ngoing to start in next week to reduce the quantity.\n\n\"My habits are always exemplary,\" answered Hillard. \"But yours?\"\n\nMerrihew's face lengthened. He pulled the yellow hair out of his eyes\nand gulped his coffee.\n\n\"Kitty Killigrew leaves in two weeks for Europe.\"\n\n\"And who the deuce is Kitty Killigrew?\" demanded Hillard.\n\n\"What?\" reproachfully. \"You haven't heard of Kitty Killigrew in _The\nModern Maid_? Where've you been? Pippin! Prettiest soubrette that's hit\nthe town in a dog's age.\"\n\n\"I say, Dan, don't you ever tire of that sort? I can't recall when there\nwasn't a Kitty Killigrew. What's the attraction?\" Hillard waved aside\nthe big black cigar. \"No heavy tobacco for me in the morning. What's the\nattraction?\"\n\nMerrihew touched off a match, applied it to the black cigar, took the\ncigar from his teeth and inspected the glowing end critically. He never\nfailed to go through this absurd pantomime; he would miss a train rather\nthan omit it.\n\n\"The truth is, Jack, I'm a jackass half the time. I can't get away from\nthe glamour of the footlights. I'm no Johnny; you know that. No hanging\nround stage-entrances and buying wine and diamonds. I might be reckless\nenough to buy a bunch of roses, when I'm not broke. But I like 'em, the\nbright ones. They keep a fellow amused. Most of 'em speak good English\nand come from better families than you would suppose. Just good\nfellowship, you know; maybe a rabbit and a bottle of beer after the\nperformance, or a little quarter limit at the apartment, singing and\ngood stories. What you've in mind is the chorus-lady. Not for mine!\"\n\nHillard laughed, recalling his conversation with the policeman.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said; \"get it all out of your system, now that you're\nstarted.\"\n\n\"And then it tickles a fellow's vanity to be seen with them at the\nrestaurants. That's the way it begins, you know. I'll be perfectly frank\nwith you. If it wasn't for what the other fellows say, most of the\nchorus-ladies would go hungry. And the girls that you and I know think\nI'm a devil of a fellow, wicked but interesting, and all that.\"\n\nHillard's laughter broke forth again, and he leaned back. Merrihew would\nalways be twenty-six, he would always be youthful.\n\n\"And this Kitty Killigrew? I believe I've seen posters of her in the\nwindows, now that you speak of it.\"\n\n\"Well, Jack, I've got it bad this trip. I offered to marry her last\nnight.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Truth. And what do you think? Dropped me very neatly two thousand feet,\nbut softly. And I was serious, too.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that your Kitty is not half bad. What would you have\ndone had she accepted you?\"\n\n\"Married her within twenty-four hours!\"\n\n\"Come, Dan, be sensible. You are not such an ass as all that.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" moodily. \"I told you that I was a jackass half the time;\nthis is the half.\"\n\n\"But she won't have you?\"\n\n\"Not for love or money.\"\n\n\"Are you sure about the money?\" asked Hillard shrewdly.\n\n\"Seven hundred or seven thousand, it wouldn't matter to Kitty if she\nmade up her mind to marry a fellow. What's the matter with me, anyhow?\nI'm not so badly set-up; I can whip any man in the club at my weight; I\ncan tell a story well; and I'm not afraid of anything.\"\n\n\"Not even of the future!\" added Hillard.\n\n\"Do you really think it's my money?\" pathetically.\n\n\"Well, seven thousand doesn't go far, and that's all you have. If it\nwere seventy, now, I'm not sure Kitty wouldn't reconsider.\"\n\nMerrihew ran his tongue along the cigar wrapper which had loosened. He\nhad seven thousand a year, and every January first saw him shouldering a\nthousand odd dollars' worth of last year's debts. Somehow, no matter how\nhe retrenched, he never could catch up. It's hard to pay for a horse\nafter one has ridden it to death, and Merrihew was always paying for\ndead horses. He sighed.\n\n\"What's she like?\" asked Hillard, with more sympathy than curiosity.\n\nMerrihew drew out his watch and opened the case. It was a pretty face;\nmore than that, it was a refined prettiness. The eyes were merry, the\nbrow was intelligent, the nose and chin were good. Altogether, it was\nthe face of a merry, kindly little soul, one such as would be most\nlikely to trap the wandering fancy of a young man like Merrihew.\n\n\"And she won't have you,\" Hillard repeated, this time with more\ncuriosity than sympathy.\n\n\"Oh, she's no fool, I suppose. Honest Injun, Jack, it's so bad that I\nfind myself writing poetry on the backs of envelopes. And now she's\ngoing to Europe!\"\n\n\"London?\"\n\n\"No. Some manager has the idea in his head that there is money to be\nmade in Italy and Germany during the spring and summer. American\ncomic-opera in those countries; can you imagine it? He has an angel, and\nI suppose money is no object.\"\n\n\"This angel, then, has cut out a fine time for his bank account, and\nhe'll never get back to heaven, once he gets tangled up in foreign\nred-tape. Every large city in Italy and Germany has practically its own\nopera troupe. In full season it is grand opera, out of season it is\ncomic-opera, not the American kind; _Martha_, _The Bohemian Girl_, _The\nMascotte_, _The Grand Duchess_, and the like. And oh! my boy, the\nhomeliest chorus you ever dreamed of seeing; but they can sing. It's\nonly the ballerina who must have looks and figure. Poor angel! Tell your\nKitty to strike for a return ticket to America before she leaves.\"\n\n\"You think it's as bad as that?\"\n\n\"Look on me as a prophet of evil, if you like, but truthful.\"\n\n\"I'll see that Kitty gets her ticket.\" Merrihew snapped the case of his\nwatch and drew his legs from under the table. \"I lost a hundred last\nnight, too.\"\n\n\"After that I suppose nothing worse can happen,\" said Hillard cheerily.\n\"You will play, for all my advice.\"\n\n\"It's better to give than receive ... that,\" replied Merrihew\nphilosophically. \"I've a good mind to follow the company. I've always\nhad a hankering to beat it up at Monte Carlo. A last throw, eh? Win or\nlose, and quit. I might.\"\n\n\"And then again you mightn't. But the next time I go to Italy, I want\nyou to go with me. You're good company, and for the pleasure of\nlistening to your jokes I'll gladly foot the bills, and you may gamble\nyour letter of credit to your heart's content. I must be off. Who is\nriding the Sandfords' black?\"\n\n\"Haven't noticed. What do you think of Kitty?\"\n\n\"Charming.\"\n\n\"And the photo isn't a marker.\"\n\n\"Possibly not.\"\n\n\"Lord, if I could only hibernate for three months, like a bear! My\ncapital might then readjust itself, if left alone that length of time.\nJack, why the deuce haven't I a relation I never heard of, who would\npolitely die to-morrow and leave me that beggarly thousand? I'm not\nasking for much. The harder I chase it, the faster it runs ahead.\"\nMerrihew thwacked his boots soundly with his crop.\n\n\"Some day I'm going to enter that thousand in the Suburban handicap. And\nwon't there be a killing!\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do you any good to borrow it?\"\n\n\"In that case I should owe two thousand instead of one. No, thank you.\nShall I see you at the club to-night?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Good-by.\"\n\nThey nodded pleasantly and took their separate ways. Merrihew stood very\nhigh in Hillard's regard. He was a lovable fellow, and there was\nsomething kindred in his soul and Hillard's, possibly the spirit of\nromance. They had met years before, at a commencement, Merrihew in his\nmortar-board and gown and Hillard as an old graduate, renewing his youth\nat the fountains. What drew them together, perhaps more than anything\nelse, was their mutual love of out-door pleasures. Their first meeting\nwas followed by many hunting and fishing expeditions, and many long\nrides on horseback. Take two men and put them on good horses, send them\nforth into the wilds to face all conditions of weather and\ninconveniences, and if they are not fast friends at the end of the\njourney, rest assured that they never will be.\n\nFor all his aversion to cards, there was a bit of the gamester in\nHillard; as, once in his office, he decided on the fall of a coin not to\nwithdraw his personal from the paper. He was quite positive that he\nwould never hear that Voice again, but having thrown his dice he would\nlet them lie.\n\nNow, at eleven o'clock that same morning two distinguished Italians sat\ndown to breakfast in one of the fashionable hotels. The one nor the\nother had ever heard of Hillard, they did not even know that such a\nperson existed; and yet, serenely unconscious, one was casting his\nlife-line, as the palmist would say, across Hillard's. The knots and\ntangles were to come later.\n\n\"The coffee in this country is abominable!\" growled one.\n\n\"Insufferable!\" assented his companion.\n\nThe waiter smiled covertly behind his hand. He had a smattering of all\ntongues, being foreign born. These Italians and these Germans! Why,\nthere is only one place in the world where both the aroma and the flavor\nof coffee are preserved; and it is not, decidedly not, in Italy or\nGermany. And if his tip exceeded ten cents, he would be vastly\nsurprised. The Italian is always the same, prince or peasant. He never\nwastes on necessities a penny which can be applied to the gaming-tables.\nAnd these two were talking about Monte Carlo and Ostend and the German\n_Kursaalen_.\n\nThe younger of the two was a very handsome man, tall, slender and\nnervous, the Venetian type. His black eyes were keen and energetic and\nroving, suggesting a temper less calculating than hasty. The mouth,\npartly hidden under a graceful military mustache, was thin-lipped, the\nmouth of a man who, however great his vices, was always master of them.\nFrom his right cheek-bone to the corner of his mouth ran a scar, very\nwell healed. Instead of detracting from the beauty of his face it added\na peculiar fascination. And the American imagination, always receptive\nof the romantic, might readily and forgivably have pictured villas,\nmaids in durance vile, and sword-thrusts under the moonlight. But the\nwaiter, who had served his time in one or another of the foreign armies,\nknew that no foil or rapier could have made such a scar; more probably\nthe saber. For the Italian officer on horseback is the maddest of all\nmen, and in the spirit of play courts hazards that another man might\nsensibly avoid in actual warfare.\n\nHis companion was less handsome but equally picturesque. His white head\nand iron-grey beard placed him outside the active army. He wore in his\nbuttonhole a tiny bow of ribbon, the usual badge of the foreign service.\n\n\"I'm afraid, Enrico, that you have brought me to America on a useless\nadventure,\" said the diplomat, lighting a thin, strong cigarette.\n\n\"She is here in New York, and I shall find her. I must have money, must!\nI owe you the incredible amount of one hundred thousand lire. There are\nmillions under my hand, and I can not touch a penny.\"\n\n\"Do not let your debt to me worry you.\"\n\n\"You are so very good, Giuseppe!\"\n\n\"Have we not grown up together? Sometimes I think I am partly to blame\nfor your extravagance. But a friend is a friend, or he is not.\"\n\n\"But he who borrows from his friend, loses him. Observe how I am placed!\nIt is maddening. I have had a dozen opportunities to marry riches. This\nmillstone is eternally round my neck. I have gone through my part of the\nfortune which was left us independently. She has all of hers, and that\nis why she is so strong. I am absolutely helpless.\"\n\n\"Poor friend! These American women! They all believe that a man must\nhave no peccadillos, once he has signed the marriage contract. Body of\nBacchus! the sacrament does not make a man less human than he was\nbefore. But this one is clever. She might be Italian born.\"\n\n\"Her mother was Italian. It is the schooling in this country that has\nmade her so clever. The only thing Italian about her is her hatred. She\nis my countrywoman there. Without her consent I can touch nothing; and\nif I divorce her, pouff! all goes to the State. Sometimes I long to get\nmy two hands round her white throat. One mistake, one little mistake! I\nam willing to swear that she loved me in the beginning. And I was a fool\nnot to profit by this sentiment. Give me patience, patience. If I say to\nher, so much and you may have your freedom, there is always that cursed\nwill. The crown of Italy will never withdraw its hand; no. With his\nwife's family on his hands, especially her brother, the king will never\nwaive his rights.\"\n\n\"Zut! softly, softly!\"\n\n\"Oh, I speak with no disrespect. But let me find her.\"\n\n\"I doubt it. And remember, we have but ten days.\"\n\n\"We shall not find time heavy. I know a few rich butchers and grocers\nwho call themselves the aristocracy.\"\n\nThey laughed.\n\n\"And some of them play bridge and \u00c3\u00a9cart\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nThe diplomat jingled his keys. He was not averse to adding a few gold\npieces to his purse.\n\n\"I have followed her step by step to the boat at Naples. She is here.\nShe is not so inconspicuous that she will be hard to find. She has\nwealthy friends, and from these I shall learn her whereabouts.\"\n\n\"You say she is beautiful; I would that I had seen her.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is beautiful; and a beautiful woman can not hide, even in a\ncity so big and noisy as this. Think of it! Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux and villas and\nsplendid rents, all waiting to be gormandized by the State! I have lied\nto her, I have humiliated myself, I have offered all the reparation a\ngentleman possibly could. Nothing, nothing! She knows; it is money, and\nshe knows it is money. The American native shrewdness! My father was a\nfool and so was hers. And on July first comes the end! Let us get out\ninto the air before I become excited and forget where I am.\"\n\n\"As you wish, _amico_.\" The diplomat beckoned to the waiter.\n\nThe waiter stepped forward with the coats and hats. His tip was exactly\nten cents, and out of this the head waiter must have his percentage.\n\nThree nights later, as Hillard and Merrihew were dining together at the\nclub, the steward came into the grill-room and swept his placid eye over\nthe groups of diners. Singling out Hillard, he came solemnly down to the\ncorner table and laid a blue letter at the side of Hillard's plate.\n\n\"I did not see you when you came in, sir,\" said the steward, his voice\nas solemn as his step. \"The letter arrived yesterday.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Thomas.\" With no small difficulty Hillard composed his face\nand repressed the eagerness in his eyes. She had seen, she had written,\nthe letter lay under his hand! Who said that romance had taken flight?\nTrue, the reading of the letter might disillusion him; but always would\nthere be that vision and the voice coming out of the fog. Nonchalantly\nhe turned the letter face downward and went on with the meal.\n\n\"I did not know that your mail came to the club,\" said Merrihew.\n\n\"It doesn't. Only rarely a letter drifts this way.\"\n\n\"Well, go on and read it; don't let me keep you from it. Some charmer,\nI'll wager. Here I pour all my adventures into your ear, and I on my\nside never so much as get a hint of yours. Go on, read it.\"\n\n\"Adventures, fiddlesticks! The letter can wait. It is probably a bill.\"\n\n\"A bill in a fashionable envelope like that?\"\n\nHillard only smiled, tipped the cradle and refilled Merrihew's glass\nwith some excellent Romanee Conti. \"When does Kitty sail?\" he asked,\nafter a while of silence.\n\n\"A week from this Saturday, February second. What the deuce did you\nbring up that for? I've been trying to forget it.\"\n\n\"Where do they land?\"\n\n\"Naples. They open in Rome the first week in March. All the arrangements\nand bookings seem to be complete. This is mighty good Burgundy, Jack. I\ndon't see where you pick it up.\" After coffee Merrihew pushed back his\nchair. \"I'll reserve a table in the billiard-room while you read your\nletter.\"\n\n\"I'll be with you shortly,\" gratefully.\n\nSo, with the inevitable black cigar between his teeth, Merrihew\nsauntered off toward the billiard-room, while Hillard picked up his\nletter and studied it. His fingers trembled slightly as he tore open the\nenvelope. The handwriting, the paper, the modest size, all these pointed\nto a woman of culture and refinement. But a subtle spirit of irony\npervaded it all. She would never have answered his printed inquiry had\nshe not laughed over it. For, pinned to the top of the letter was the\nclipping, the stupid, banal clipping--\"Will the lady who sang from\n_Madame Angot_ communicate with gentleman who leaned out of the window?\nJ.H. Burgomaster Club.\" There was neither a formal beginning nor a\nformal ending; only four crisp lines. But these implied one thing, and\ndistinctly: the writer had no desire for further communication \"with\ngentleman who leaned out of the window.\" He read and re-read slowly.\n\n      I am sorry to learn that my\n    singing disturbed you. There\n    was a reason. At that partic-\n    ular moment I was happy.\n\nThat was all. It was enough. She had laughed; she was a lady humorously\ninclined, not to say mischievous. A comic-opera star would have sent her\npress agent round to see what advertising could be got out of the\nincident; a prima donna would have appealed to her primo tenore, for the\nsame purpose. A gentlewoman, surely; moreover, she lived within the\nradius, the official radius of the Madison Square branch of the\npost-office, for such was the postmark. Common sense urged him to\ndismiss the whole affair and laugh over it as the Lady in the Fog had\ndone. But common sense often goes about with a pedant's strut, and is\nsomething to avoid on occasions. Here was a harmless pastime to pursue,\ncommon sense notwithstanding. The vein of romance in him was strong, and\nall the commercial blood of his father could not subjugate it. To find\nout who she was, to meet her, to know her, if possible, this was his\nfinal determination. He rang for paper and a messenger, and wrote:\n\"Madame Angot. There is a letter for you in the mail-department of this\noffice.\" This time his initials were not necessary. Once the message was\non its way, he sought Merrihew, whom he found knocking the balls about\nin a spiritless manner.\n\n\"A hundred to seventy-five, Dan.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For the mere fun of the game, of course.\"\n\n\"Make it cigars, just to add interest.\"\n\n\"Cigars, then.\"\n\nBut they both played a very indifferent game. At ten-thirty Merrihew's\neyes began to haunt the clock, and Hillard grew merciful for various\nreasons.\n\n\"What time does the performance end?\" he asked.\n\n\"At ten-fifty, but it takes about twenty minutes to scrape off the\nmake-up.\"\n\n\"Run along, then, my son; I can spare you. And you've a cigar coming.\"\n\nMerrihew agreeably put his cue in the rack.\n\n\"Much obliged for the dinner, Jack. I'll return the favor any night you\nsay.\" He made off for the coat-room.\n\nHillard laughed, and went up to the writing-room to fulfil a part of his\ndestiny. He took the letter out and read it again. A woman of wit and\npresence; a mighty good dinner companion, or he was no judge of women.\nHe replaced the letter in its blue covering, and then for the first time\nhis eye met the superscription. Like a man entranced he sat there\nstaring. The steward had brought the letter to him, and in his first\nexcitement this had made no impression upon his mind; he had seen\nnothing peculiar nor strange. And here it was, not his initials, but his\nname in full.\n\nShe knew who he was!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMADAME ANGOT\n\n\nIn a fashionable quarter of the city there stood a brownstone house,\nwith grotesque turrets, winding steps, and glaring polished red tiles.\nThere was a touch of the Gothic, of the Renaissance, of the old English\nmanor; just a touch, however, a kind of blind-man's-buff of a house. A\nvery rich man lived here, but for ten months in the year he and his\nfamily fluttered about the social centers of the world. And with a house\nlike this on his hands, one could scarce blame him. Twice a week, during\nthis absence, a caretaker came in, flourished a feather duster, and went\naway again. Society reporters always referred to this house as \"the\npalatial residence.\"\n\nThis morning a woman stood in the alcove-window and looked down into the\nglistening street. There was a smile on her lips, in her eyes, in the\ntemporary little wrinkles on either side of her nose. The Venetian red\nof her hair trapped the reflected sunlight from the opposite windows,\nand two little points of silver danced in her blue eyes. Ah! but her\neyes were blue; blue as spring-water in the morning, blue as the summer\nsky seen through a cleft in the mountains, blue as lapis-lazuli, with\nthe same fibers of gold. And every feature and contour of the face\nharmonized with the marvelous hair and the wonderful eyes; a beautiful\nface, warm, dreamy, engaging, mobile. It was not the face of a worldly\nwoman; neither was it the face of a girl. It was too emotional for the\nsecond, and there was not enough control for the first. It seemed as if\nshe stood on the threshold of life, with one hand lingering regretfully\nin the clasp of youth and the other doubtfully greeting womanhood;\naltogether, something of a puzzle.\n\nBut the prophecy of laughter did not come to pass; the little wrinkles\nfaded, the mouth grew sad, and the silver points no longer danced in her\neyes. The pain in her heart was always shadowing; like a jailer it\njealously watched and repressed the natural gaiety which was a part of\nher. Those who have been in serious wrecks are never quite the same\nafterward; and she had seen her fairest dream beaten and crumpled upon\nthe reef of disillusion.\n\nYet again the smile renewed itself. She was a creature of varying moods.\nShe twisted and untwisted the newspaper. Should she? Ought she? Was it\nnot dreadfully improper and bizarre? Had she not always regretted these\nsingular impulses? And yet, what harm to read this letter and return it\nto the sender? She was so lonely here; it was like being among a strange\npeople, so long ago was it that her foot had touched this soil. Was it\npossible that she was twenty-five? Was there not some miscount, and was\nit not fifteen instead? As old and as wise as the Cum\u00c3\u00a6an Sybil at one\nmoment, as light and careless as a Hebe the next. Would not this war of\nwisdom and folly be decided ere long?\n\nShe opened the paper and smoothed out the folds. \"Madame Angot. There is\na letter for you in the mail-department of this office.\" It was so\ndroll. It was unlike anything she had ever heard of. A personal inquiry\ncolumn, where Cupids and Psyches billed and cooed, and anxious Junos\nsearched for recreant Jupiters! The merest chance had thrown the\noriginal inquiry under her notice. Her answer was an impulse to which\nshe had given no second thought till too late. She ought to have ignored\nit. But since she had taken the first step she might as well take the\nsecond. She was lonely; the people she knew were out of town; and the\njest might amuse her.\n\nThis man was, in all probability, a gentleman, since he was a member of\na gentlemen's club. But second thought convinced her that this proved\nnothing. Men are often called gentlemen out of compliment to their\nancestors. Still, if this man only saw the affair from her angle of\nvision, the grotesque humor of it and not the common vulgar intrigue!\nShe hesitated, as well she might. Supposing that eventually he found out\nwho she was? That would never, never do. No one must know that she was\nin America, about to step into the wildest of wild adventures. No; she\nmust not be found out. The king, who had been kind to her, and the court\nmust never know. From their viewpoint they would have declared that she\nwas about to tarnish a distinguished name, to outrage the oldest\naristocracy in Europe, the court of Italy. But she had her own opinion;\nwhat she proposed to do was in itself harmless and innocent. But this\ngentleman who leaned out of the window? What should she do with him?\nWhat had possessed her to sing at that moment? A block above or below\nhis window, and no one would have heard, not even the policeman. This\ntime the laughter bubbled. It was all so funny. She had heard every word\nof their conversation. She had seen the match flare in the young man's\nface. Fortunately they had not thought to peer into the area-ways. Was\nit the face she had seen in that flash of light that interested her\nsufficiently to risk the note? Against the dark of the night it had\nappeared for an instant, clean, crisp, ruddy as a cameo. Sometimes a\nsingle glance is enough; the instinct of the heart is often surer than\nthe instinct of the mind. She would not have been afraid had he found\nher. The face warranted confidence.\n\nShe had sung because she had been happy, happy with that transient\nhappiness which at times was her portion. Could she ever judge another\nman by his looks? She believed not. How she had run! The man,\nbareheaded, giving chase, and the burly policeman across the street!\nChorus-ladies--what in the world were they?\n\nShe stepped down from the alcove, wound the grey veil round the\nriding-crop and tossed them into a corner. Somehow, in the daylight, the\nmagic was gone from his face, for she had recognized him that first day\nin the park. He rode well. She knew that his interest in her had been\nonly casual. She touched a bell. A maid appeared.\n\n\"Signora?\"\n\n\"Bettina, you will go to the office of this newspaper and inquire for a\nletter addressed to Madame Angot. You can speak that much English. And\nbe quick, for I may change my mind.\"\n\n\"I go at once, Signora.\" And she was back in less than half an hour.\n\n\"There was a letter, then?\" The points were dancing again in the blue\neyes.\n\n\"And here it is, signora.\" The maid's eyes sparkled, too. An intrigue!\nIt would not be so dull hereafter.\n\n\"You may go. Perhaps,\" and Bettina's mistress smiled, \"perhaps I may let\nyou read it and answer it, after I am done with it. That would be rather\nneat.\"\n\n\"But it will be in English, signora; and that I can not read.\" Bettina's\neyes filled with disappointment.\n\n\"You may use it as a lesson. In a few days you should be able to master\nit.\"\n\nThe slight nod was a dismissal, and the maid went about her duties,\nwhich were not many in this house. These were terrible days; the two of\nthem alone in this strange _palazzo_, and the stuffy, ill-smelling\n_trattoria_ they dined at! _Che peccato!_ And that she should sit side\nby side with her mistress! _Santa Maria_, what was the good world coming\nto? And the ban on the familiar tongue! English? She despised it.\nGerman? She detested it. But to be allowed to speak in French, that\nalone made conversation tolerable. And this new mad whim! Oh, yes; the\nsignora was truly mad this time.\n\nMeanwhile the lady with the Venetian hair toyed with the letter. Club\npaper. Evidently he was not afraid to trust her. But would he amuse her?\nWould he have anything to say that would interest her? She ran the\npaper-knife under the flap. The contents gave her a genuine surprise.\nShe ran to the window. Italian! It was written in Italian, with all the\nflourishes of an Italian born. She turned to the signature. Hillard; so\nhe had signed his name in full? She ruminated. How came such a name to\nbelong to a man who wrote Italian so beautifully? Here was something to\nponder over. She smiled and looked at the signature again.... John,\nGiovanni. She would call him Giovanni. She had been rather clever. To\nhave had the wit to look in the library for the blue book and the club\nlist; not every woman would have thought of that. Then a new inspiration\ncame to her, and she struck the bell again. She sent Bettina for the\ncard-basket in the lower hall. She scattered the contents upon the\nfloor, touched up the wood fire, and sat down Turkish-wise. She sorted\nthe cards carefully, and lo! she was presently rewarded. She held up the\ncard in triumph. He had called at this house on Thanksgiving Day. He was\nknown, then, to the master and mistress, this Giovanni with the Irish\nsurname. Very good. She now gave her full attention to the letter,\nwhich, incredible as it may seem, she had not yet perused.\n\n     To the Lady in the Fog--To begin with, let me say that I, too, have\n     laughed. But there was some degree of chagrin in my laughter. On my\n     word of honor, it was a distinct shock to my sense of dignity when\n     I saw that idiotic personal of mine in the paper. It is my first\n     offense of the kind, and I am really ashamed. But the situation was\n     not ordinary. Ordinary women do not sing in the streets after\n     midnight. As you could not possibly be ordinary, my offense has\n     greater magnitude. To indite a personal to a gentlewoman! A\n     thousand pardons! I doubted that it would come under your notice;\n     and even if it did, I was sure that you would ignore it. And yet I\n     am human enough to have hoped that you wouldn't. When I found your\n     note, it was a kind of vindication; it proved that a singular\n     episode had taken place. To find a woman with an appreciable sense\n     of humor is rare; to find one who couples this with initiation is\n     rarer still. I do not refer to wit, the eternal striving to say\n     something clever, regardless of cost. How you found out my name\n     confuses me.\n\n\"Indeed!\" murmured the lady.\n\n     Doubtless you have the club list in your house. Do you know, when\n     the letter was brought me, I saw nothing unusual about the address.\n     It was only when I began this letter that I comprehended how clever\n     you were. There are half a dozen J.H's at the club. I tell you\n     truthfully, over my own name, that your voice startled me. It would\n     have startled me under ordinary circumstances. In New York one does\n     not sing in the streets. It is considered bad form by the police.\n\n\"Thanks! I must remember that.\"\n\n     I was startled, then, because my thoughts were far away. I was\n     dreaming of Italy, where I was born, though there is no more\n     Italian blood in my veins than there is in yours.\n\nThe ruddy head became erect and the blue eyes searched the glowing seams\nin the logs. Here was a riddle.\n\n\"What made him think that, I wonder?\"\n\n     I therefore write this in a language familiar to us both, certain\n     you could not sing Lecocq's songs in Italian if you did not speak\n     and understand it thoroughly. Signora or signorina, whichever it\n     may be, have we no mutual friends? Are you not known to some one\n     who knows me? Some one who will speak for me, my character, my\n     habits? Modesty forbids that I myself should dwell upon my virtues.\n     I could refer you to my bankers, but money does not recommend the\n     good character of a man. It merely recommends his thrift, or more\n     generally that of his father.\n\n\"That will pass as wit,\" said the lady. \"But it is rather a dull letter,\nso far. But, then, he is wandering in the dark.\"\n\n     You say you sang because at that moment you were happy. This\n     implies that you are not always so. Surely, with a voice like yours\n     one can not possibly be unhappy. If only I might meet you! Will you\n     not do me that honor? I realize that this is all irregular, out of\n     fashion, obsolete. But something tells me that neither of us is\n     adjusted properly to prosaic environments. Isn't there just a\n     little pure, healthy romance waiting to be given life? Your voice\n     haunts me; out of every silence it comes to me--\"She is so\n     innocent, so youthful!\"\n\n     John Hillard.\n\nThe letter fluttered into her lap. She leaned on her elbows. It was not\na bad letter; and she rather liked the boyish tone of it. Nothing vulgar\npeered out from between the lines. Did he really love music? He must,\nfor it was not every young man who could pick out the melody of an old,\nforgotten opera. She shivered, but the room was warm. Had fate or chance\nsome ulterior purpose behind this episode? Rather than tempt fate she\ndecided not to answer this letter; aside from her passive superstition,\nit would be neither wise nor useful. She desired to meet no strangers;\nto be left to herself was all she wished. Her voice, it was all she had\nthat afforded her comfort and pleasure.\n\nRomance! The word came back to her. With an unmusical laugh she stood\nup, shaking the letter to the floor. Romance! She was no longer a girl;\nshe was a woman of five and twenty; and what should a woman know of\nromance? Ah, there had been a time when all the world was romance,\nromance; when the night breeze had whispered it under her\ncasement-window, when the lattice-climbing roses had breathed it, when\nthe moon and the stars had spelled it. Romance! She hated the word not\nless than she hated the Italian language, the Italian people, the\ncountry itself. She spurned the letter with her foot and fed the\nnewspaper to the fire. She would let Bettina answer the letter.\n\nShe went down-stairs to the piano and played with strong feeling.\nPresently she began to sing a haunting melancholy song by Abt. From Abt\nshe turned to Flotow; from Offenbach to Rossini; from Gounod to Verdi.\nThe voice was now sad or gay, now tender or wild. She was mistress of\nevery tone, every shade, every expression.\n\nThe door opened gradually. The little maid's face was moved to rapture\nover these exquisite sounds.\n\nCrash! It was over.\n\n\"Bettina? Bettina, are you listening?\"\n\n\"I am always listening.\" Bettina squeezed into the room. \"I had not the\nheart to interrupt. It is beautiful, beautiful! To sing like that!\"\nThen, with a burst of confidence: \"There will be kings and dukes at your\nfeet!\"\n\n\"Enough!\"\n\n\"Pardon, signora, I forgot. But listen; I bring a message. A boy came to\nsay that the rehearsal will be at four this afternoon. It is now after\ntwelve.\"\n\n\"So late? I did not know. We must be off to lunch.\"\n\n\"And the letter up-stairs on the floor?\"\n\n\"Some day, Bettina, you will enter the Forbidden Chamber, and I shall\nhave to play Bluebeard. This time, however, I do not mind. Leave it\nthere or burn it,\" indifferently.\n\nBettina knew her mistress. She thought best to leave the letter where it\nlay, forgotten for the time being.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBLINDFOLDED\n\n\nFor two days the club steward only nodded when Hillard came in; he had\nno letters to present.\n\n\"I am thirty-three years old,\" Hillard mused, as he sought the\nreading-room. \"Down-town I am looked upon as a man of affairs, a\nbusiness man, with the care of half a dozen fortunes on my hands. Now,\nwhat's the matter with me? I begin to tremble when I look that sober old\nsteward in the face. If he had handed me a letter to-night, I should\nhave had to lean against the wall for support. This will never do at\nall. I have not seen her face, I do not know her name; for all I know,\nshe may be this Leddy Lightfinger.... No, that would be impossible.\nLeddy Lightfinger would have made an appointment. What possesses me to\ndwell in this realm of fancy, which is less tangible than a cloud of\nsmoke? Have I reached my dotage by the way of the seven-league boots? Am\nI simply bored with the monotony of routine, and am I groping blindly\nfor a new sensation?\" He smoked thoughtfully. \"Or, am I romantic? To\ncreate romance out of nothing; I used to do that when I was a boy. But\nI'm a boy no longer. Or, _am_ I a boy, thirty-three years old?... She\ndoes not answer my letter. Sensible woman. In her place I shouldn't\nanswer it. But in my place I want her to. Two weeks ago I was haunting\nthe curio-shops for a Roman cameo two thousand years old; to-night I\nmight take it as a gift. I have ceased to be interested in something\nthat has always interested me. Something is wrong; what is it? She sent\nfor my letter. That indicates that she read it. Well, well!\" reaching\nfor the _London Illustrated News_; \"let's see what their Majesties have\nbeen doing the past fortnight.\"\n\nThe King of England was preparing to descend to the Riviera; the King of\nSpain was killing pigeons; the Kaiser was calling for more battleships;\nthe Czar of all the Russias was still able to sit for his photograph;\nthe King of Italy was giving a f\u00c3\u00aate; and Leopold of Belgium was winning\nat Monte Carlo. Among the lesser nobles the American duchesses were\ncreating a favorable impression in spite of their husbands.\n\n\"What a fine sensation it must be,\" Hillard murmured, \"to be able at any\ntime to plunge one's noble white hand into a sack of almost\ninexhaustible American dollars!\"\n\nHe dropped the paper. The same old stories, warmed over. There was\nreally nothing new in the world. If Giovanni returned to Italy in the\nspring, he was of a mind to go with him. He looked up and was glad to\nsee Merrihew in the doorway.\n\n\"Been looking for you, Jack. Want your company to-night. Kitty Killigrew\nis giving a little bite to eat after the performance, and has asked me\nto bring you along. Will you come?\"\n\n\"With pleasure, Dan. Are you dining with any one to-night?\" Hillard was\nlonesome.\n\n\"Yes. A little bridge till eleven.\"\n\n\"You're hopeless. I can see you in limbo, matching coffin-plates with\nCharon. I'll hunt you up at eleven.\"\n\n\"Heard the talk?\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"Why, some one in the club has been using the agony column. The J.H's\nare being guyed unmercifully, and you'll come in for it presently. It's\na case of wine on the man who did it.\"\n\nHillard felt of his collar and drew down his cuffs. \"Probably some\njoke,\" he ventured tentatively.\n\n\"If it isn't, the man who would stoop to such tommyrot and tack the name\nof his club to it must be an ass.\"\n\n\"No doubt about that. Odd that this is the first time I have heard about\nit.\" But silently Hillard was swearing at his folly. There was one crumb\nof comfort: the incident would be forgotten in a few days.\n\n\"I may depend upon you to-night, then?\" said Merrihew.\n\n\"I shall be pleased to meet Miss Killigrew,\" which was a white one.\nHillard would have paid court to a laundress rather than offend\nMerrihew.\n\nAnd promptly at eleven he went up to the card-room and dragged Merrihew\naway. Merrihew gave up his chair reluctantly. He was winning. He would\nhave been just as reluctant, however, had he been losing. The amateur\ngambler never wants to stop.\n\nOn the way to the Killigrew apartment, Merrihew's moods varied. At one\nmoment he was on the heights, at the next in the depths. He simply could\nnot live without Kitty. Perhaps if this trip abroad turned out badly she\nmight change her mind. Seven thousand _could_ be made to muster. Twice\nHillard came very near making his friend a confidant of his own affair;\nbut he realized that, while Merrihew was to be trusted in all things, it\nwas not yet time.\n\nHe found a pleasing and diverting company. There was M\u00c3\u00a8re Killigrew, a\nquaint little old lady who deplored her daughter's occupation but\nadmitted that without her success, Heaven only knew how they would have\ngot along. There was the genial Thomas O'Mally, a low-comedian of\ngenuine ability, whom Hillard knew casually; Smith, a light-comedian;\nand Worth, a moderately successful barytone to whom Hillard took one of\nthose instant and unaccountable dislikes. These three and Kitty were\ngoing abroad. And there were several members of _The Modern Maid_\ncompany, which went on tour the following Monday.\n\nKitty fancied Hillard from the start; and he on his side found her well\neducated, witty and unaffected. She was even prettier than her\nphotograph. Merrihew's face beamed upon them both, in a kind of\nbenediction. He had known all along that once Jack saw Kitty, he would\nbecome a good ally in fighting down her objections.\n\n\"Think of singing in Italy!\" cried Kitty. \"Isn't it just wonderful?\"\n\n\"And has Merrihew told you to get a return ticket before you sail?\" with\nhalf a jest.\n\n\"Don't you think it will be successful?\" a shade of disappointment.\n\"There will be thousands of lonesome Americans over there. Out of\npatriotism, if for nothing else, they ought to come and see us.\"\n\n\"They certainly ought to. But I'm an old killjoy.\"\n\n\"No, no; go on and tell me all your doubts. You have been over there so\nmany times.\"\n\n\"Well, supposing your tourists are tired, after having walked all day\nthrough the churches and galleries? They may want to go to bed early.\nBut you never can tell till you try. You may become the rage on the\ncontinent. Yet, you go into the enemy's country. It isn't the same as\ngoing to London, among tolerant cousins. In Italy and in Germany there\nis always so much red tape, blundering, confusing red tape, custom\nduties, excessive charges. But your manager must know what he is doing.\"\n\n\"He has everything in black and white, I believe. But your advice is\nsensible.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything about Italy or Germany?\"\n\n\"Only what I learned in my geographies,\" laughing. \"Rome, Florence,\nGenoa, Venice, Nice, Milan, Strasburg, Cologne, and on to Berlin! It is\nlike a fairy story come true.\"\n\n\"Who is your prima donna?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah!\" Kitty's face became eager with excitement. \"Now you have put your\nfinger on the mystery that is bothering us all. Not one of us has seen\nher or knows her name. She has not rehearsed with us and will not till\nwe reach Naples, where we rest a week. When we speak of her, the manager\nsmiles and says nothing; and as none of us has seen the backer, Mr.\nWorth thinks that she herself is the prima donna and backer in one. We\nthink that she is some rich young woman who wishes to exploit her voice.\nThere's a lot of them in the world. I wish I knew her. I am dying of\ncuriosity. The manager is not a man to fool away his time. She doubtless\ncan act and sing. Little has been said about the venture in the papers,\nand I'm glad. We may prove a perfect fizzle, and the less said the\nbetter. As we can't walk back, I must learn to swim.... Lunch is ready,\nevery one!\"\n\nThe mummers and the outsiders flocked into the small dining-room. There\nwas plenty to eat--beer, soda, whisky, and two magnums of champagne,\nMerrihew's contribution to the feast. Hillard listened with increasing\namusement to the shop-talk. Such and such a person (absent) never could\nact; such and such a composer (absent) was always giving the high note\nto the wrong singer; such and such a manager (absent) never staged the\nopera right. It was after one when they returned to the sitting-room,\nwhere the piano stood. The wine was now opened and toasts were drunk.\nO'Mally told inimitable stories. There was something exceedingly droll\nin that expressive Irish face of his and the way he lingered over his\nwine.\n\n[Illustration: O'Mally told inimitable stories]\n\n\"There is nothing so good as a glass of champagne,\" he observed, \"unless\nit is another.\"\n\nWorth did not drink, but Hillard did not like his handsome face any the\nmore for this virtue. He sang remarkably well, however, and with a\nwillingness Hillard had not believed he possessed. He wondered vaguely\nwhy he disliked the man. He had never met him before, and knew nothing\nat all about him. It was one of those inexplicable things which can not\nbe answered. Otherwise Hillard enjoyed himself vastly. He found these\npeople full of hope, light-hearted, generous, intelligent, and generally\nimprovident.\n\n\"Mr. Merrihew has been telling me all about you,\" said Kitty.\n\n\"You mean, of course, my good qualities,\" replied Hillard.\n\n\"To hear him talk, one would think that you possessed nothing else. But\nI am sure that you have glaring faults, such as a man might pass over\nand a woman go round.\"\n\n\"I believed that Merrihew had a serious fault till to-night,\" he said;\nand he made no attempt to disguise the admiration in his eyes.\n\nShe looked at him quickly and colored. It was a good sign.\n\n\"Has the foolish boy been telling you that I refused to marry him? I\nlike him very much,\" she added gravely; \"but I shall never marry any man\ntill I have ceased to love the stage. Just now I can not wisely love\nanything else.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" he said.\n\n\"I am not a whit less extravagant than he is. How could the two of us\nlive on an income which he himself admits that he can not live within?\nBut that isn't it; a million would not make any difference. I am like a\nyoung colt; I have no desire to be harnessed yet. A month after I am\ngone he will forget all about me; or, at least, he will only recollect\nme with a sigh of relief. There will be others; only I hope they will\ntreat him as frankly as I have done.\"\n\n\"Merrihew is the most loyal man I know,\" Hillard declared, bound to\ndefend his comrade against this shrewd insight to his character.\n\n\"Of course he is loyal! And he is always in earnest--for the moment.\"\nShe laughed. \"But if he marries any one while I am gone, I shall hate\nhim.\"\n\nAnd then they both laughed.\n\n\"I'll wager another magnum,\" cried Merrihew from across the room, \"that\nI'm the subject under discussion.\"\n\n\"Another magnum!\" murmured O'Mally rapturously.\n\n\"No more magnums,\" said Kitty resolutely.\n\n\"On abstract principles, then!\" insisted Merrihew.\n\n\"You win,\" Kitty replied merrily. \"We have been saying only nice things\nabout you.\"\n\nIt was outrageously late, nearly four, when the revelers took leave of\ntheir hostess. Merrihew was happy with that evanescent happiness which\ngoes hand in glove with late suppers and magnums. In the morning he\nwould have a headache.\n\n\"Isn't she a little wonder, Jack? Do you blame me?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Dan. It might be a good thing for you to marry a sensible\nlittle woman like that. But she won't have you.\"\n\n\"No, she won't.\" Merrihew reached for his watch. \"Four A.M. Wonder if we\ncan't find another bottle somewhere.\"\n\n\"You are going home, my boy.\"\n\n\"All right, if you say so,\"--good-humoredly. \"Say, what do you think of\nthat man Worth?\"\n\n\"Very good voice; but he's too handsome. Being a plain duffer myself, I\ndon't take kindly to handsome men.\"\n\n\"Oh, go on! You're as fine a looking chap as there's in New York. But\nthis man Worth has the looks of a lady-killer. He's been eying Kitty,\nbut it doesn't go. Hang it, I can't see why she won't marry me now.\nShe's got to, some time or other.\"\n\n\"You must have patience.\"\n\n\"Or more money. Can't O'Mally tell a good story, though?\"\n\n\"Good company, too; but I should hate to turn him loose in my\nwine-cellars. I imagine that he's not a connoisseur, and will praise\nanything that's good to drink, unless it's water.\"\n\nMerrihew roared.\n\n\"Well, here's your station, Dan. You go home like a good boy. Shall I\nsee you to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Eight-thirty in the park. Gallop off headache. Nothing like a horse for\na headache. Good night.\"\n\nMerrihew climbed the elevated stairs and vanished. Hillard arrived home\ntired and sleepy; but as he saw a letter on the stand in the hall, his\ndrowsiness passed quickly. There was no other blue envelope like it. She\nnow had his house address; she was interested enough to look it up. She\ndid not follow his lead and write in Italian; she wrote in\nEnglish--crisp English, too. Again there was neither beginning nor\nending. But this was a letter; there was something here of the woman,\nsomething to read and read again.\n\n     I had told the maid to burn your letter. But she left it on the\n     floor where I had thrown it, and I came across it this morning. It\n     looked rather pathetic. So I am writing you against my better\n     judgment. Yes, I know your name; I find that I am well acquainted\n     with people you know. I am a woman who often surrenders to the\n     impulse of the moment; I may or may not answer any future letter\n     from you. You write very good Italian; but it will surprise you to\n     learn that I detest all things that are Italian. Once I loved them\n     well. Why should you wish to know me? Our ways are as divergent as\n     the two poles. Happy because I sing? There are some things over\n     which we can sing or laugh, but of which we can not speak without\n     crying. Happy or unhappy, what can this matter to you? To you I\n     shall always remain the Lady in the Fog. Are you rich, young,\n     talented? I care not in the least. Perhaps it amuses me to add to\n     your confusion. Find me? I think not. Seek me? Do so; I permit you\n     to. And would you know me if you found me? Misguided energy!\n\nHillard put the letter away, extinguished the lights, and passed up to\nhis room. She defied him to find her? This was a direct challenge. He\nwould accept it. This time he would use no personal to tell her that a\nletter awaited her. She should make the inquiries herself. And from the\nmail-clerk he would obtain a description of the elusive Madame Angot.\nNext morning he rode in the park with Merrihew. Again he saw the veiled\nlady on the Sandford black. Out of normal curiosity he telephoned the\nstables and made inquiries. The reply was short. No one at the stables\nknew the lady, but she rode the horse on proper authority.\n\nThat night he wrote:\n\n     I shall keep on writing till you cease to reply. Let me be frank\n     with you. I am bored; so are you. The pleasure you derive in\n     keeping up this mystery engages you. You bid me to find you. I\n     accept the challenge. You must understand at once that it is the\n     mystery that interests me. It is the unknown that attracts me. I am\n     mentally painting you in all sorts of radiant colors. You defy me\n     to find you. There is nothing so reliable as the unexpected,\n     nothing so desperately uncertain as a thing assured. I warn you\n     that I shall lay all manner of traps, waylay your messengers, bribe\n     them. I shall find out where you live. The rest will be simple.\n\nShe replied:\n\n     I have no desire to alleviate your confessed boredom. Your\n     persistence would be praiseworthy if well directed. Waters wear away\n     stone, the wind crumbles the marble, but a woman is not moved till\n     she wishes to be. I never thought that I should dabble in an\n     intrigue of this sort, and I am surprised at the amusement it\n     affords me. I really owe you some gratitude. The few I have met who\n     know you tell me that you are a \"nice young man.\"\n\nHe rebelled at the adjective. Every man has some portion of self-love.\nSo his next effort was a passionate denial that he was nice. When should\nhe meet her? The postman brought him a letter which contained one\nword--_Nimmer!_ He sent her four pages, a frank and witty description of\nhimself and friends, his past and some of theirs.\n\nOn the day she received this letter a cablegram came to her from the far\nMediterranean. Whatever it contained had the effect to cause all\nrestraint to disappear from the tone of her letters. They became\ncharming; and more and more Hillard found himself loving a Voice. All\nhis watching, all his traps, came to no successful end. She was too\nclever for him. He sought the mail-department of the great newspaper;\nthe clerk couldn't remember, there were so many calling for mail.\nLetters passed to and fro daily now, but always she declared that it was\nimpossible for them to meet. To write a letter was one thing, to meet a\nstrange man in an unconventional manner was another. No, it was out of\nthe question to dine with him in a restaurant. It was equally out of the\nquestion to cook a dinner where she lived, as she and her maid dined at\na small restaurant near-by. Would he not be content with the romance and\nlet the reality go? Finally he proposed to bring the dinner all cooked\nfrom the club. Two days went by without a sign; then the blue letter\ncame.\n\n     I surrender. The most fatal thing in life is curiosity. It has the\n     power to lead us into all manner of trouble. And I have my share of\n     curiosity. Remember, you never would have found me. I may dwell in\n     a garret; I may be hideous; perhaps nothing remains to me but my\n     voice. Whatever you have painted me in your imagination, I tell you\n     that I shall prove directly the opposite. And now the terms. And if\n     you do not follow them confidently and blindly, your dinner will\n     grow cold in the carriage. Dinner will be at eight, February first.\n     At seven a carriage will call for you. The messenger will blindfold\n     you. He will then proceed to the club and take the dinner, and\n     bring you here. Be warned! If you so much as lift the corner of the\n     bandage, the romance will end then and there. It is necessary to\n     enforce these conditions, but it is not necessary to explain why. I\n     realize that I am doing something very foolish and unwise. But, as\n     you say, I am a woman who has seen much of the world. Thus I have\n     my worldly side. I shall use it as a buffer.\n\n\"Blindfolded!\" Hillard scrubbed his chin. All these precautions! Who was\nshe? What was she? An ordinary young woman, full of mischief, or was she\nwhat he hoped, a real mystery? He was well on the way to find out. Since\nthere was no escape, blindfolded he would go.\n\nAt half after six, on the night of the first of February, then, he began\nto dress. It was some time since he had taken such particular care.\n\n\"The signore seems in high spirits to-night,\" observed Giovanni, as he\nlaid out the linen.\n\n\"Man, I'm happy and greatly excited. Do you recollect the lady who sang\nunder my window? I am going to meet her to-night. The mystery will be a\nmystery no longer.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\" asked Giovanni sharply. It was rarely he asked a question\nwith such directness.\n\nBut his master was too excited to note it. \"On my word, I don't know who\nshe is, Giovanni. She has written such charming letters! She may be only\na singer; she may be a Russian princess in exile; she may be an\nadventuress of the most formidable type; she may be an American girl.\nOne thing, she is not English. English women as I have found them lack\nthe essential spirit of adventure.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Giovanni stroked his lips doubtfully. \"It is not like the signore\nto plunge blindly into adventures like this.\"\n\n\"The very word, blindly. I go blindfolded, _amico_. What do you think of\nthat?\"\n\n\"Blindfolded?\" Giovanni was horrified. \"It is a trap!\" he cried. \"They\nwill assassinate you! No, you shall not go! In Rome, at the carnivals,\nit is an old game. They will rob you.\"\n\n\"You are dreaming. This is America; things are not done that way here.\nAnd nothing now can turn me aside.\" Hillard was all the while finishing\nhis toilet.\n\n\"I suppose not. But blindfolded!\"\n\n\"Take the number of the cab as I get in. If anything should happen, give\nthe number to the police.\"\n\nGiovanni, with a sharp movement of the hands, expressed his resignation\nto the worst. He knew the futility of arguing with his master. But he\nfollowed him down to the hall and tied on the bandage himself. He was\nhonest about it, too, for Hillard could see nothing. Then the\nmessenger-boy took him by the hand and led him to the carriage. As the\ntwo were climbing in, Giovanni spoke rapidly in his native tongue.\n\n\"There is no number on the carriage!\"\n\n\"Too late to bother now.\"\n\nThe carriage rolled off toward the club, where the dinner, hot and\nsmoking, was taken on.\n\n\"Joinin' th' Elks?\" asked the boy, when they were well under way once\nmore.\n\n\"No, it's a s\u00c3\u00a9ance. They are going to call up my fate round a table.\"\n\n\"Huh? Aw, go-wan! Dey don't call up no ghosts wit' French cider and hot\nboids.\" The boy relapsed into silence.\n\nHillard tried to follow the turns of the carriage, but these were too\nmany; and so he resigned himself to become totally lost. By and by the\ncarriage stopped.\n\n\"Dis is where we alights, me loid!\" the boy jeered. \"An' no lookin',\nmind.\"\n\nHillard found the carriage steps and landed safely. He stood for a\nmoment, listening. They were in a quiet part of the city; no elevated or\nsurface cars were near. He was assured that the location was exclusive.\nGarrets are not to be found in quiet places.\n\n\"Look out fer th' steps,\" said the boy, again taking Hillard by the\nhand.\n\n\"And you be careful of that basket.\"\n\n\"I ain't lettin' it drop any.\"\n\nWinding steps, thought the blindfolded man. He could recollect none. It\nseemed to him that they stood there five minutes before the door opened.\nWhen it did, the boy passed in the basket and resolutely pushed Hillard\ninto the hall. The door closed gently, and the adventure was begun.\nWhither would it lead him?\n\n\"Take off the bandage the signore may now,\" said a voice in broken\nEnglish.\n\n\"Thanks!\" He tore the handkerchief from his eyes and blinked. The hall\nwas so dimly lighted that he could see nothing distinctly.\n\n\"The signore's coat and hat.\"\n\nHe passed over these articles, shook the wrinkles from his trousers,\nsmoothed his chin, and stood at attention. The maid eyed him with\nabundant approval, then knocked timidly on the door leading to the\ndrawing-room. He was sure of one thing: this was some millionaire's\nhome. What if he should see in the drawing-room a party of his intimate\nfriends, ready to plague and jest? He shuddered. He never had\nentertained such an appalling probability.\n\n\"_Avanti!_\" called a soft voice from within.\n\nHillard gathered in his courage, opened the door and stepped inside. A\nsingle lamp in a far corner drew his glance, which roved a moment later.\nOn a divan near this lamp sat a woman in black. Only a patch of white\nthroat could be seen, for her shoulders were not bare and her arms only\nto the elbows. Her back was turned squarely. He could see nothing of her\nface. But what a head! He caught his breath. It glowed like a\ncopper-beech in the sunshine. What was it? There was something,\nsomething he could not see.\n\n\"Madame?\" he faltered. He had had a gallant Italian phrase to turn for\nher benefit. He spoke English instead, and not very firmly.\n\nThe woman turned. Hillard took a step backward and blundered against a\npedestal.\n\nShe was masked!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE MASK\n\n\nMasked! Only her mouth and chin were visible, and several little pieces\nof court-plaster effectually disguised these. There _was_ a mystery. He\nto come blindfolded and she to wear a mask! Extraordinary! There was\nsomething more than a jest: she really did not wish to be known, and the\nreason lay far back of all this, beyond his grasp. He stood there\ndumfounded. She rose. The movement was elegant.\n\n\"And this,\" she said ironically, \"is the gentleman who leaned out of the\nwindow?\"\n\nHe brought all his faculties together, for he knew that he would need\nthem in this encounter. \"Supposing I had fallen out of it? Well, it\ncould not have mattered. I should not have been more at your feet than I\nam now.\" This was very good, considering how dry his tongue was.\n\n\"If you had fallen out? I had not thought of that. A modern Ulysses,\nhouse-broken, and an itinerant siren! You had been wise to have stuffed\nyour ears that night.\"\n\n\"My mythology is rusty. And I much prefer Penelope. She interests me\nvastly more than the ancient prize-fighter.\"\n\n\"But sit down, Mr. Hillard, sit down.\" The lady with the mask motioned\nhim to a chair directly under the light. She wished to study his face\nwhile she talked.\n\nHillard reached the chair successfully enough, but he never could\nrecollect how. He sat down as a bashful man sits down in a crowded\nball-room, with his knees drawn in tightly and his feet at sympathetic\nangles. He knew that she would have the best of him in this engagement.\nAll the bright things to say would come to him after he had gone home.\nIt was far easier to write letters. That mask! One might as well\nconverse with the Sphinx. His face was hers to study; her emotions would\nbe wholly her own.\n\nPresently she laughed with malice.\n\n\"You are not comfortable in that chair.\"\n\n\"That is true; and yet it is soft and roomy. I am uneasy. Perhaps you\nrecall to my subconsciousness a period in my former existence on earth;\nor, if you will, one of my ancestors.\"\n\n\"I fail to understand.\"\n\n\"Well, a Hillard two hundred years ago had his head cut off by an ax.\nHis executioner wore a mask.\"\n\n\"A mistake. Your ancestor should have been hanged.\"\n\n\"And I along with him, you would imply?\"\n\n\"Are you not Irish? I have known Irishmen by the name of Hillard.\"\n\n\"They were in disguise. But I have a generous strain of Irish blood in\nme. Otherwise I shouldn't have had the courage to follow up an adventure\nlike this.\"\n\n\"Thanks. The compliment is rather ambiguous.\"\n\n\"My compliments can not possibly be more ambiguous than your appearance.\nSurely, there will be an hour for unmasking.\"\n\n\"It has already begun, Mr. Hillard.\"\n\n\"So I am the one who is to be unmasked? Well, I have only the mask\nnature gave to me. I wish she had been more liberal. But I shall see\nwhat can be done with it.\"\n\n\"Is there any mask quite so terrible, quite so deceptive, as this very\nmask nature gives us? Can it not lie adroitly, break hearts, overthrow\nempires? You can judge a character by this mask sometimes, but never the\nworking of the mind behind it.\" She resumed her seat on the divan.\n\n\"I wish I could read yours.\"\n\n\"And much good it would do you.\" She smiled, rather ruefully Hillard\nthought.\n\nHe took note of her teeth, and felt a sudden tinge of regret. One may\ndisguise the face and hair, but the teeth are always the same. Two lower\nteeth on the right side appeared to be gone; the others were firm and\nglistening white. It was a pity, for a woman's teeth are as much her\nglory as her hair.\n\n\"I am curious to learn what you brought for dinner.\"\n\nHe enumerated the delicacies.\n\n\"You have evidently studied your Lucullus,\" she said.\n\nSilence. The ruddy light on her hair fascinated him.\n\n\"What is it?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Your hair,\" with a simplicity which silenced her. \"You have the most\nbeautiful hair I have ever seen.\"\n\n\"Thank you. And yet, for all you know, it may be a fine wig.\"\n\n\"If it is, I shall never be sure of anything again. Am I in prosaic New\nYork? Have you not, by some carpet-magic, transported me to old Europe?\nIf a dozen conspirators came in in cowls to render me the oath, I should\nnot be at all surprised.\"\n\n\"There is no magic; only a mask.\"\n\n\"And there is no way of seeing behind that?\"\n\n\"None, absolutely none. I am told that you are a gentleman; so I am\nconfident that you will not stoop to use force.\"\n\n\"Only the force of eloquence, if ever I may lay claim to that again.\"\n\n\"You are beginning well. For I tell you, Mr. Hillard, I shall expect but\nthe most brilliant wit from you to-night. As for me, I shall only\ninterpolate occasionally. Now, begin.\"\n\n\"I am not used to dancing without the pole.\"\n\n\"You must learn. Dance!\"\n\n\"Upon what--nothing? And how shall I know that my dancing pleases you?\"\n\n\"I agree to tell you. I wear this mask to-night because I am taking a\nsurreptitious leaf out of my book of cares.\"\n\n\"Cares? Have you any?\"\n\n\"If I were without cares it would not be necessary to seek diversions of\nthis equivocal character.\" She crossed her arms. The magic of old Venice\nseemed at that moment to enfold her.\n\n\"You are, then, seeking a diversion?\"\n\n\"Nothing more or less. Do not flatter yourself that there is anything\npersonal or romantic on my side. I am bored.\"\n\n\"I am wholly in your hands,\" he said; \"and they are very beautiful\nhands.\"\n\n\"Is there anything more beautiful than a cat's paw, when the claws are\nhidden? Never judge a woman by her hands.\" Nevertheless she buried her\nhands in the depths of a down-pillow. She had forgotten her rings. She\nslipped them off and managed to hide them.\n\n\"I promise to remember. Your letters--\" he began diffidently. Where the\ndeuce was his tongue? Was he to be tongue-tied all the evening before\nthis Columbine, who, with the aid of her mask, was covertly laughing at\nhis awkwardness?\n\n\"My letters? A woman often writes what she will not say, and says what\nshe will not write. Did you not ask me to disillusion you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but softly, softly. I begin to believe one thing: you brought me\nhere to teach me a lesson. Gentlemen should never use the personal\ncolumn.\"\n\n\"Nor should ladies read it. I am not saving any mercy for myself!\" with\nlaughter.\n\n\"Shall I begin with my past?\"\n\n\"Something less horrifying, if you please!\"\n\n\"I object to the word nice,\" he said, seeking a new channel, for he was\nnot steering very well in those he had so far selected.\n\n\"The word was employed negligently. Your friends used the word.\"\n\n\"I should have preferred milksop!\" He was growing impatient. \"Hadn't you\nbetter try some new kind of torture?\"\n\n\"This is only a skirmish; your real torture hasn't even begun yet. But\nthis will give you an appetite. I do not drink champagne, but the\nchambertin will do nicely. Oh, I propose that you shall pay for this\ndinner, Mr. Hillard; pay for the privilege of sharing it with me.\"\n\n\"Bring on the check. I should like to settle the bill at once, and have\nit off my mind.\"\n\n\"You may take off your gloves,\" she countered. \"I know that you must\nfeel uncomfortable with them on. To clasp one's own hands is a kind of\npersonal sympathy. Try it.\"\n\nHe drew them off, not ungracefully, and tucked them away. He spread his\nthin brown muscular fingers a few times, then folded his arms.\n\n\"You look quite Napoleonic in that pose.\"\n\n\"If this were only Elba and not St. Helena! I should be coming back to\nyou some day.\"\n\n\"I shall credit that against the partridges.\"\n\nThis time her laughter was relaxed and joyful. And somehow he felt more\nat ease. He was growing accustomed to the mask. He stretched his legs\nand fingered his nether lip.\n\n\"Have you not somewhere an invisible cloak?\"\n\n\"I had one that night, which nature lent me,\" she answered readily. \"I\nwas so invisible to you that I heard the policeman call out your name. I\nthank you for insisting that I was not a chorus-lady.\"\n\nHere was a revelation which accounted for many things. \"I haven't been\nvery fortunate so far in this adventure.\"\n\n\"That is rank ingratitude. I am of the opinion that fortune has highly\nfavored you.\"\n\n\"But the mask, the mask! If you heard the policeman call my name, you\nmust have heard him speak of one Leddy Lightfinger.\"\n\n\"I did indeed. And is it not possible that I am that very person?\"\n\nHillard dropped his hand toward his watch. \"Why do you hate Italy?\"\n\nShe sat straight, and what little he could see of her mouth had\nhardened.\n\n\"There will be no retrospection this evening, if you please,\" her voice\nrather metallic.\n\nThe mystery lifted its head again. One does not hate a country without a\nstrong and vital reason. Was Giovanni partly right, after all? Was this\na kind of trap, a play to gain his interest? Was her singing under his\nwindow purely accidental? She hated Italy. The State or the Church? More\nlikely the State. And what had the State done to her or she to the\nState? A conspirator, in need of funds and men? If this was the case,\nshe was not going about her cause scientifically. Italy had no hold upon\nanything of his save his love of beauty. Perhaps her reason for hating\nItaly was individual and singular: as she would have hated any other\ncountry, had her unhappiness originated there.\n\n\"Will you not sing?\" he asked. This was an inspiration. Music might\nassist in melting her new reserve.\n\n\"You recollect, then, that I possess a voice?\"\n\n\"It is all I have to recollect. Tell me, whither is all this to lead?\"\n\n\"To the door, and into the fog again.\"\n\n\"On my word, I'm half inclined to believe you to be an anarchist or a\nRed, or something on that order.\"\n\n\"On account of my hair?\" She laughed again. \"Put yourself at ease. I am\nneither Leddy Lightfinger nor a socialist. There are no dynamite bombs\nin this house. I despise any organization which aims to destroy society.\nSociety is bad enough as it is; but think of trying to readjust it!\"\n\n\"I give up the puzzle.\"\n\n\"That is better.\"\n\nIt is difficult to seek and hold a pair of eyes partly hidden behind a\nmask. Several times he made the attempt, but his eyes were first to\nlower.\n\nHer severity, her irony and her apparent lack of warmth were mere\nmatters of calculation. Her plan was to inspire him with trepidation, to\nkeep him always at arm's length, for his own safety as well as hers. She\nknew something of men. Even the best, if suddenly thrown into an affair\nso strange as this, might commit an irreparable blunder; and this she\ndid not want Hillard to do. She was secretly pleased with his strong\nface and shapely head. There was neither beard nor mustache to hide the\nvirtues or defects. The chin was square but not heavy, the mouth\nhumorous, kindly and firm, the nose bridged; and the brown eyes, sleepy\nyet with latent fires, were really handsome. She knew all about him; she\nwas not afraid to be alone with him; nor was it really necessary to wear\na mask. But the romance in her heart, that she believed to be dead, was\nnot dead, only waiting to be rekindled. True, they were never to meet\nagain; it was all to begin to-night and end to-night. No man was likely\nto forget a face met under such whimsical and extraordinary\ncircumstances; so he must not have hers to remember. She arose.\n\n\"I will sing!\"\n\n\"That is more than I dared to hope.\" He made as though to rise.\n\n\"Sit down. I do not play by note; my memory is very good. While I am\nsinging I should much prefer you to remain where you are.\"\n\nHe obeyed without protest, and she went to the piano. Above the\ninstrument was a rare old Venetian mirror; in it he could see her face\nfairly well. And where had he seen that mirror before?\n\n\"What shall it be?\" she asked, and he forgot the mirror.\n\n\"The song you sang under my window.\"\n\n\"But that is for the male voice!\"\n\n\"You sang it very well, nevertheless. I have a good memory, too.\" He\nleaned forward, his arms crossed on his knees. Was there ever, in all\nthe world, such an Arabian night?\n\nShe sang, but without that buoyant note of the first night. One after\nanother he called out the popular airs of the old light operas. She had\nthem all on her tongue's end.\n\n\"Light opera appeals to you?\" She had followed in the mirror his\nslightest move. Was she disappointed?\n\nWhere had he seen that copy of Botticelli before? If only there was a\nlittle more light.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" he said. \"You asked--?\"\n\nShe repeated her question, wondering what had drawn his attention.\n\n\"I like my grand opera after dinner. After dinner I shall want Verdi,\nBerlioz, Gounod.\"\n\n\"But after dinner I may not care to sing.\" She spoke in German.\n\nHe was not expecting this tongue; besides, his German had never been a\nfinished product. For all that, he made a passable reply.\n\n\"You speak as many languages as a Swiss hotel-concierge.\"\n\n\"I wish I did. My mother had one idea in regard to my youth: I should\nspeak four languages and eventually become a great diplomat. As it\nstands, I speak indifferent French and German, and am not in the\ndiplomatic service. My mother had one of the loveliest voices. It was a\njoy to hear her speak, now Italian, now German, now French. She\nunderstood that in these days one does not travel far with Greek and\nLatin, though they come in handy when you strike old inscriptions. We\nwere great comrades. It was rare fun to go with her on an\nantique-hunting expedition. They never fooled her nor got the better of\nher in a bargain.\"\n\nShe liked the way he spoke of his mother.\n\n\"But you,\" he said; \"you are not Italian.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"You are neither French, German nor English.\"\n\nShe still smiled, but to the smile she added a gentle shrug.\n\n\"You are American--like myself!\" he hazarded.\n\nHer fingers stirred over the keys again, and Grieg's _Papillon_\nfluttered softly from flower to flower.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nINTO THE FOG AGAIN\n\n\nHe sat there, waiting and listening. From the light and airy butterfly,\nthe music changed to Farwell's _Norwegian Song_. Hillard saw the lonely\nsea, the lonely twilight, the lonely gull wheeling seaward, the lonely\nlittle cottage on the cliffs, and the white moon in the far east. And\npresently she spoke, still playing softly.\n\n\"My father was an American, my mother Italian. But I have lived in\nEurope nearly all my life. There! You have more of my history than I\nintended telling you.\" The music went dreamily.\n\n\"I knew it. Who but an American woman would have the courage to do what\nyou are doing to-night? Who but one of mine own countrywomen would trust\nme so wholly and accept me so frankly for what I am, an American\ngentleman?\"\n\n\"Softly!\" she warned. \"You will dig a pit for your vanity.\"\n\n\"No. I am an American gentleman, and I am proud of it; though this\nstatement in your ears may have a school-boy ring.\"\n\n\"A nobility in this country? Impossible!\"\n\n\"Not the kind you find in the _Almanach de Gotha_. I speak of the\nnobility of the heart and the mind.\" He was very much in earnest now.\n\n\"Indeed!\" The music stopped, and she turned. She regarded his\nearnestness with favor.\n\n\"I have traveled much; I have found noblemen everywhere, in all climes,\nand also I have found beasts. Oh, I confess that my country is not\nwholly free from the beast. But the beast here is a beast; shunned,\ndiscredited, outcast. On the other side, if he be mentioned in the\n_Almanach_, they give him sashes and decorations. And they credit us\nwith being money-mad! It is not true. It is proved every day in the\nforeign cables that our love for money is not one-tenth so strong as\nthat which our continental cousins evince.\"\n\n\"But if you are not money-mad, why these great fortunes?\" dubiously.\n\n\"At a certain age a fortune in this country doubles itself without any\neffort on the part of the owner. Few of us marry for money; and when we\ndo, we at least have the manhood to keep the letter of our bargain. We\ndo not beat the wife, nor impoverish her, nor thrust opera-singers into\nthe house she shares with us.\"\n\n\"And when you marry?\"\n\n\"Well, it is generally the woman we love. Dowries are not considered.\nThere is no social law which forbids a dowerless girl to marry a\ndowerless man,\" laughing. \"But over there it is always and eternally a\nbusiness contract simply. You know that.\"\n\n\"Yes, a business contract,\" listlessly.\n\n\"And yet these foreigners call us a business nation! Well, we are,\noutside our homes. But in the home we are husbands and fathers; most of\nus live cleanly and honestly; we make our homes our havens and our\nheavens. But of course there is always the beast. But they talk of\nnobility on the other side. That is it; they talk, talk. Italy, France,\nGermany! Why, I had rather be the son of an English farmer than a prince\non the continent. And I had rather be what I am than the greatest\nnobleman in England.\"\n\n\"Go on, go on! I like it. What do you call it--jingo?\"\n\n\"Call it what you will. Look at the men we produce. Three or four\nhundred years ago Europe gave us great poets, great artists, great\nsoldiers, great churchmen, and great rascals. I admire a great rascal,\nwhen he is a Napoleon, a Talleyrand, a Machiavelli; but a petty one! We\nhave no art, no music, no antiquity; but we have a race of gentlemen.\nThe old country is not breeding them nowadays.\"\n\n\"No, she simply prints new editions of the _Almanach_. Continue; I am\nbecoming illumined.\"\n\n\"If I am boring you?\"\n\n\"No. I have the greatest admiration for the American gentleman. My\nfather was one. But I have met Americans who are not so loyal as you\nare, who see no good in their native land.\"\n\n\"I said we have beasts; I forgot to mention the cads. I am perfectly\nfrank. Italy is the most beautiful country in the world; France is\nincomparable; Germany possesses a rugged beauty which I envy for my\ncountry's sake. Every square foot of it is cultivated; nowhere the\nsqualidity one sees among the farm-houses of this country. Think of the\nhistories, the romance, the art, the music! America has little history;\nand, saving the wildernesses, it is not beautiful; but it is generous\nand bountiful and healthy mentally. Europe is a story-world, and I\nshould like nothing better than to read it to the end of my days.\"\n\n\"Signora, dinner is served!\" The little maid stood between the sliding\ndoors which gave entrance to the dining-room.\n\nSignora! thought Hillard. He certainly would look at her hands again.\n\n\"After you, Mr. Hillard,\" she said.\n\nHe bowed and passed on before her. But not till he had passed did he\nunderstand the manoeuver. To follow her would have been nothing less\nthan the temptation to pluck at the strings of her mask. Would he have\ntouched it? He could not say, the temptation not having been his.\n\nThat dinner! Was he in New York? Was it not Bagdad, the bottle and the\ngenii? Had he ever, even in his most romantic dreams, expected to turn a\npage so charming, so enchanting, or so dangerous to his peace of mind? A\ngame of magical hide-and-seek? To see, yet to be blindfolded! Here,\nacross the small table, within arm's length, was a woman such as, had he\nbeen a painter, he must have painted; a poet, he must have celebrated in\nsilken verse. Three-and-thirty? No, he was only a lad this night. All\nhis illusions had come back again. At a word from this mysterious woman,\nhe would have started out on any fool's errand, to any fool's land.\n\nAnd she? A whim, a fantastic, unaccountable whim; the whim of a woman\nseeking forgetfulness, not counting the cost nor caring; simply a whim.\nShe had brought him here to crush him for his impertinence; and that\npurpose was no longer in her mind. Was she sorry? Did he cause her some\nuneasiness, some regret and sadness? It was too late. There could be no\nPrince Charming in her world. He had tarried too long by the way. Not\nthat there was the least sentiment in her heart regarding him; but his\npresence, his freshness, his frank honesty, these caused her to resort\nto comparisons. It was too late indeed.\n\nOn the little table was a Tuscany brass lamp of three wicks, fed by\nolive oil. It was sufficient to light the table, but the rest of the\nroom was sunk in darkness. He half understood that there was a definite\npurpose in this semi-illumination: she had no wish that he should by\nchance recognize anything familiar in this house. Dimly he could see the\nstein-rack and the plate-shelf running around the walls. Sometimes, as\nthe light flickered, a stein or a plate stood out boldly, as if to\nchallenge his memory.\n\nHe watched her hands. The fingers were free from rings. Was she single\nor married? The maid had called her signora; but that might have been a\ndisguise, like the mask and the patches of court-plaster.\n\n\"May I ask you one question?\"\n\n\"No,\" promptly. There was something in his eyes that made her grow wary\nof a sudden.\n\n\"Then I shan't ask it. I shall not ask you if you are married.\"\n\n\"And I shall not say one way or the other.\"\n\nShe smiled and he laughed quietly. He had put the question and she had\nanswered it.\n\nNeither of them ate much of this elaborate dinner. A game like this\nmight easily dull the sharpest appetite. He studied her head, the curves\nof her throat, the little gestures, the way her shoulders seemed to\nnarrow when she shrugged; and all these pictures he stored away for\nfuture need. He would meet her again; a touch of prescience told him\nthis. When, where, did not matter.\n\nA running conversation; a fencing match with words and phrases. Time\nafter time she touched him; but with all his skill he could not break\nthrough her guard. Once or twice he thrust in a manner which was not in\naccord with the rules.\n\n\"And that interesting dissertation on the American gentleman?\" she said\nicily, putting aside each thrust with a parry of this kind.\n\n\"That's the trouble with posing as a moralist; one must live up to the\nprecepts. Would you believe me if I told you that, at the age of\nthree-and-thirty, I am still heart-whole?\"\n\nShe parried: \"I trust you will not spoil that excellent record by making\nlove to me.\" She reached for the matches, touched off one, watched it\nburn for a moment, extinguished it, and then deliberately drew a line\nacross the center of the table-cloth.\n\n[Illustration: She deliberately drew a line across the centre of the\ntable-cloth]\n\n\"Now what might that represent?\" he asked curiously.\n\n\"A line, Mr. Hillard. The moment you cross that line, that moment you\nleave this house. On guard!\"\n\n\"Come, that is not brave. You can retreat till your shoulders touch the\nmat, but I must stand this side of the line, unable to reach you. And\nyou have the advantage of the mask besides. You are not a fair fencer.\"\n\n\"The odds should be in my favor. I am a woman. My wrist is not so strong\nas yours.\"\n\n\"Physically, of course, I may pass the line; to reach the salt, for\ninstance. Will that be against the rules?\"\n\n\"To a certain extent, no.\"\n\n\"You make it very hard. You have put temptation in my path.\"\n\n\"Bid Satan get behind thee.\"\n\n\"But supposing he should take it into his head to--shoulder me forward?\"\n\n\"In that case, under the new rules, I should referee the matter.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew the color of your eyes. Behind those holes I see nothing\nbut points of fire, no color. Are they blue, brown, grey?\"\n\n\"They are blue. But supposing I wear this mask because my face is\ndreadfully scarred, and that I have some vanity?\"\n\n\"Vanity, yes; but scars, never; at least never so deep as you yourself\ncan make. You do not wear that mask to cover defects, but out of mercy\nto me.\"\n\nAnd so the duel went on. Sometimes the heat of the mask almost\nsuffocated her, and she could hardly resist the desire to tear it from\nher face. Yet, in spite of this discomfort, she was enjoying herself.\nThis adventure was as novel to her as it was to him. Once she rose and\napproached the window, slyly raising the mask and breathing deeply of\nthe cold air which rushed in through the crevices. When she turned she\nfound that he, too, had risen. He was looking at the steins, one of\nwhich he held in his hand. Moreover, he returned and set the stein down\nbeside his plate.\n\n\"Tell me, why do you do that?\" There was an anxious note in her voice.\n\n\"I have an idea. But let us proceed with the dinner. This salad--\"\n\n\"I am more interested in the idea.\" She pushed aside the salad and took\na sip of the ruby Burgundy. Had he discovered something?\n\n\"May I smoke?\" he asked.\n\n\"By all means.\"\n\nHe lighted a cigarette and put the case near the line.\n\n\"Do you not enjoy a cigarette?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" she answered. \"But that idea--\"\n\n\"Will you not have one?\" He moved the case still nearer to the line.\n\nShe reached out a firm round white arm.\n\n\"One moment,\" he said; \"let us understand each other thoroughly.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" her arm poised in mid-air. \"To touch a cigarette you\nmust cross the line to this side.\"\n\nShe withdrew her arm slowly.\n\n\"I shall not smoke. If I crossed the line I should establish a dangerous\nprecedent. A good stroke. Now, the idea. I must have that idea.\"\n\nHe blew the smoke toward the lamp; it sailed over the flaming wicks and\ndarted into the dark beyond.\n\n\"The mirror over the piano confused me. I had seen it somewhere before.\nThen, there was that old copy of Botticelli. The frame was familiar, but\nI could not place it. This stein, however!\" He laughed; the laughter was\nboyish, even triumphant.\n\n\"Well, that stein?\" She was now leaning across the table, her fingers\ntense on the cloth.\n\n\"I bought that stein two seasons ago. This is the Sandfords' place, and\nyou are the veiled lady who has been riding Mrs. Sandford's favorite\nhunter in the park.\"\n\n\"And so?\"\n\n\"I shall find out who you are presently.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"That shall be my secret. Mutual friends, indeed! You will not have to\nsend me home blindfolded.\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I shall do, in a certain sense. My name?\nPerhaps. But you will never know my face.\"\n\n\"Suppose I should determine to cross the line, despite your precepts?\"\n\nThey stood up simultaneously. In a matter of this sort he was by far the\nquicker. In an instant he had caught her by the wrist, at the same time\ndrawing her irresistibly round the table toward him. His grasp was not\nrough, only firm. She ceased to pull against him.\n\n\"I must see your face. I shall never be at peace if I do not.\"\n\n\"Certainly you will never know any peace if you do. Be careful!\"\n\nHis free hand stole toward the strings of her mask. She moved not. His\nface was very close to hers now. If only she would struggle! Yes, he was\ncertain now that her eyes were blue. But they looked at him with a\nmenace which chilled his ardor. He dropped the hand from the mask and\nreleased her wrist.\n\n\"No, I haven't the courage. If I take that mask from your face, it will\nbe the end. And I do not want this ever to end. If you will not let me\nsee your face of your own free will, so be it. I shall see it some day,\nmark me. Fate does not cross two paths in this manner without a\npurpose.\" He stepped back slowly. \"You do not understand the lure of\nthat mask.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do. I am beginning to admire your self-control, Mr. Hillard;\nI am beginning to admire it very much. But I am tired now, and I must\nask you to go.\"\n\n\"Once more, will you let me see your face?\"\n\n\"No. If, as you say, fate intends for us to meet again, you will see it.\nBut I have my doubts. So it is my will to pass out of your life as\ncompletely as though I had never entered it; from one fog into another.\nNo, I am not a happy woman; I am not happy in my friendships. Listen to\nme,\" and her voice grew low and sweet. \"Let me appeal to your\nimagination. This light adventure shall be a souvenir for your old age.\nOne night Romance stepped into your life and out of it. Think! There\nwill always be the same charm, the same mystery, the same enchantment.\nKnowing nothing of me, there will follow no disillusions, no\ndisenchantments; I shall always be Cinderella, or the Sleeping Beauty,\nor what your fancy wills. Do you understand me?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she proceeded, \"nothing lasts so long in the recollection as\na pleasant mystery. In other days, in other times.... Well, on my side I\nshall recall this night pleasantly. Without knowing it, you have given\nme a new foothold in life. I did not believe that there lived a single\nman who could keep to the letter of his bargain. Presently you will\nforget the chagrin. Good night! And do not lean out of any more\nwindows,\" she added lightly.\n\n\"You are right,\" he said reluctantly. \"Something to dream over in my old\nage. And certainly I shall dream of it; a flash of sunlight in the\nshadow.\"\n\nThen slowly he reached down toward her wine-glass. She understood his\npurpose and essayed to stop him.\n\n\"Do not deny me this little thing,\" he said.\n\nShe let her hand fall. He took the glass, held it against the light to\nsee where her lips had touched it. Carefully he poured out the wine from\nthe opposite side and kissed the rim.\n\n\"I shall keep this glass. I must have some visible object to make sure\nthat this hasn't been a dream. Mrs. Sandford may send me the bill.\"\n\n\"You may kiss my hand, Mr. Hillard.\"\n\nHe bent quickly and kissed, not the hand, but the wrist where the marks\nof his fingers still remained faintly. He squared himself, and gazed\nlong and steadfastly into her eyes. In that moment he seemed to her\npositively handsome; and there was a flutter in her heart that she was\nunable to define. On his part he realized the sooner he was gone the\nbetter; there was a limit to his self-control.... He gained the street\nsomehow. There he stopped and turned. Did the curtain move? He wasn't\nsure; but he raised his hat, settled it firmly on his head, and walked\nrapidly away. He was rather proud of himself. He had conquered a hundred\ntemptations. And he confidently knew that it would be many a day before\nshe ceased to think of him. Was she single or married? Well, it mattered\nnot, one way or the other; he knew that long years ago this night had\nbeen written and his fate summed up. Unhappy? There was more than one\nmask. Once in his own room, however, the longing to see her face grew\nterribly strong. He stood the glass on the mantel and stared at it. Why\nmust she go out of his life? What obstacle was there to stand between\nthem and a kindly friendship?\n\nThere was little sleep for him that night; and in the morning the first\nthing he did was to pick up the wine-glass. It was all true. And then\nhis good resolutions melted and vanished. He must have one more word\nwith her, happen what might. So at ten o'clock he called a cab and drove\nrapidly to the Sandford place. Snow had fallen during the night, and\nmany of the steps were still spotless white. Impossible! He leaned from\nthe cab and rubbed his eyes. Absolutely impossible! For, what did he\nsee? Wooden shutters over all the lower windows and the iron gates\nclosed before the doors! And not a footprint anywhere. This was\nextraordinary. He jumped from the cab, ran up the steps, and rang the\nbell, rang it ten times with minute intervals. And no one answered. Then\nhe heard a call from across the street. A man stood in one of the\narea-ways.\n\n\"Nobody home!\" he shouted. \"Gone to Egypt.\"\n\n\"But there was some one here last night,\" Hillard shouted back.\n\n\"Last night? Guess you've got the wrong street and wrong house, young\nman.\"\n\n\"But this is the Sandford place?\"\n\n\"Nothing else.\"\n\n\"I was here last night.\"\n\n\"Dreaming. That house has been empty since November. I happen to be the\ncaretaker.\"\n\nHillard went back to his cab, dazed. No one there last night? Come,\ncome; there was a mistake somewhere. It was out of the question that he\nhad been in another house. He would soon find out whether or not he had\ndined there the night before.\n\n\"A cable-office!\" he cried to the cabby. \"Hurry!\"\n\nOnce there he telephoned down-town and secured Sandford's cable address.\nThen he filled out a blank which cost him ten dollars. Late that night\nat the club he received his reply. It was terse.\n\n     You are crazy. House absolutely empty. SANDFORD.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE TOSS OF A COIN\n\n\nHillard made an inexcusably careless shot. It was under his hand to have\nturned an even forty on his string. He grounded his cue and stood back\nfrom the table. That was the way everything seemed to go; at tennis, at\nsquash, at fencing, at billiards, it was all the same. The moment\nvictory was within his grasp his interest waned. Only last night he had\nlost his title as the best fencer in the club; disqualified in the\npreliminaries, too, by a tyro who would never cease to brag about the\naccident.\n\n\"I say, Jack, what's the matter with you, anyhow?\" asked Merrihew, out\nof patience. \"A boy could have made that three-cushion, his hands tied\nbehind him.\"\n\n\"It was bad,\" Hillard agreed. \"Perhaps I am not taking the interest in\nthe game that I formerly took.\"\n\n\"I should say not. You lost me fifty last night. Corlis has no more\nright to cross foils with you than I have; and yet he goes in for the\nfinals, while you are out of it. Where's your eye? Where's your grip?\"\n\nHillard chalked his cue silently.\n\n\"And when I make a proposition,\" pursued Merrihew, \"to ride to the\nCatskills and back--something you would have jumped at a year ago--you\nshake your head. Think of it! Through unbroken roads, nights at\nfarm-houses, old feather beds, ice in the wash-basin, liver and bacon\nfor breakfast, and off again! Snow or rain! By George, you had a bully\ntime last year; you swore it was the best trip we ever took on the\nhorses. Remember how we came back to town, hungry and hardy as Arctic\nexplorers? Come on; everything is dull down-town. Where's your spirit of\nadventure?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know where it is. Shall we finish the game?\"\n\n\"Not if you're going to throw it like this,\" declared Merrihew. He was\nproud of his friend's prowess in games of skill and strength, and he was\nwroth to see him lose all interest unaccountably.\n\n\"Ten and a string against your half a string,\" said Hillard, studying\nthe score. \"I'll bet a bottle that I beat you.\"\n\n\"Done!\" said Merrihew. Being on his mettle, he made a clean score of\ntwenty, five to go. \"I can see you paying for that check, Jack.\"\n\nBut the odds tingled Hillard's blood. He settled down to a brilliant\nplay and turned sixty-one in beautiful form. There were several shots\nwhich caused Merrihew to gasp.\n\n\"Well, it's worth the price of the bottle. If only you had had that eye\nlast night! We'll have the bottle in the alcove at the head of the\nstairs. I want to talk to you.\"\n\nSo the two passed up-stairs to the secluded alcove, and the bottle\nshortly followed. Merrihew filled the glasses with the air of one who\nwould like to pass the remainder of his days doing the same thing. Not\nthat he was overfond; but each bottle temporarily weeded out that crop\nof imperishable debts, that Molochian thousand, that Atalanta whose\nspeed he could not overtake, having no golden apples. To him the world\ngrew roseate and kindly, viewed through the press of the sparkling\ngrape, and invariably he saw fortune beckoning to the card-tables.\n\n\"Now, then, Jack, I've got you where I want you. Who is she?\"\n\n\"On my word, I don't know,\" answered Hillard, stirring restlessly.\n\n\"Then there is a woman!\" cried Merrihew, astonished at his perspicacity.\n\"I knew it. Nothing else would so demoralize your nerve. Shall we drink\na health to her?\"\n\nHillard raised his glass and touched that of his comrade. For the good\nof his soul and the peace of his mind, he then and there determined to\ntell Merrihew the whole adventure, without a single reservation.\n\n\"To the Lady in the Fog!\" he said.\n\n\"Fog?\" blankly.\n\n\"Well, the Lady in the Mask.\"\n\n\"Fog, mask? Two of them?\"\n\n\"No, only one. Once I met her in the fog, and then I met her in the\nmask.\"\n\n\"I'll drink to her; but I'm hanged if I don't believe you're codding\nme,\" said Merrihew disappointedly. \"This is New York.\"\n\n\"I know it; and yet sometimes I doubt it. Here's to the lady.\"\n\nThey drank. Hillard set down his glass; Merrihew refilled his.\n\n\"The whole story, Jack, details and all; no half-portions.\"\n\nHillard told the yarn simply, omitting nothing essential. He even added\nthat for three weeks he had been the author of the personal inquiry as\nto the whereabouts of one Madame Angot. More than that, he was the\nguilty man who had set the club by the ears.\n\n\"I don't know, Dan, but this has taken so strong a hold on me that I\nshan't forget it soon. Imagine it yourself. Oh, but she could sing! I am\na man not to be held in the leash of an adventure like this; but she\nheld me. How? By the hope that one day I might see her face, with no\nveil of mystery to hold her off at arm's length.\"\n\nMerrihew was greatly excited. He was for ordering a second bottle, but\nHillard stayed him.\n\n\"By George! And you are sure that it was at the Sandfords'?\"\n\n\"I am positive. But there is a puzzle that I have failed to solve:\nSandford's cable and the caretaker's declaration. I know that I was in\nthat house. I ran across a stein which I had given Sandford. I have\ninquired of the police; they had been requested to watch the house in\nthe absence of the owner. The patrolman says that he has seen no light\nin the house since the family sailed for Africa. I sleep soundly; never\nhave nightmares. And yet, but for her letters and the fact that Giovanni\nheard her sing under my window, I might almost believe I've been\ndreaming. It is no dream; but it begins to look as if I were the victim\nof some fine hoax.\"\n\n\"And Sandford mixed up in it,\" supplemented Merrihew.\n\n\"Sandford and I are good friends, but we are not so intimate that he'd\ntake the pains to work out a hoax of this magnitude. It did not\noriginate with him, and his wife is altogether out of the picture. If I\nhad only seen her face, I might have forgotten all about her in a few\ndays. But the mask, the charm, the mystery! I can't get her out of my\nthoughts; I am irrational in all I do; an absolute failure in the\noffice.\"\n\n\"It is more than a hoax, in my opinion. Wait till Sandford returns and\nfinds his silver gone!\"\n\nHillard started.\n\n\"And his gold-plate,\" continued Merrihew, pleased with the idea. \"My\nboy, that's what it is; the best dodge I ever heard of. But how did they\nget into the house, she and her maid? It will make a good story for the\nSunday papers. You won't be in it, unless she ropes you in as an\naccomplice. That would be rich!\"\n\n\"I'm a romantic ass!\" Hillard sighed. Leddy Lightfinger! If this turned\nout to be the case, he would never trust a human being again; he would\ntake to breeding dogs.\n\n\"Let's take that ride on the horses,\" Merrihew urged. \"That'll clear\nyour brain of this sentimental fog.\"\n\n\"No!\" Hillard struck his hands together. \"I've a better idea than that,\nand it has just come to me. I shall go to Italy in March, and you, my\nboy, shall go with me.\"\n\n\"Impossible! Why, I'm all but broke.\" Merrihew shook his head decidedly.\n\n\"I'll take you as a companion. I'm a sick man, Dan. I'm likely to jump\noverboard if some one isn't watching me every minute.\"\n\n\"I'd like to go, Jack; Heaven and earth, but I should! But I can't\npossibly go to Italy with a letter of credit no more than twenty-five\nhundred, and that's all there is in the exchequer at present.\"\n\n\"Between such friends as we are--\"\n\n\"That racket won't work. I could not take a moment's peace if I did not\nfeel independent. Supposing I wanted to come home and you didn't, or you\ndid and I didn't? No, Jack; nothing to it that way.\" And Merrihew was\nright.\n\n\"But I'm not going to give it to you!\" Hillard protested. He was\ndetermined to break down Merrihew's objections if it took all night. \"I\nam going to lend it to you.\"\n\n\"And could I ever pay you back if I accepted the loan?\" humorously.\n\"You'll have to invent some other scheme.\"\n\n\"There's Monte Carlo; you might pull down a tidy sum,\" said the tempter.\n\n\"That's the way, you beggar; hit me on the soft side.\" But Merrihew was\nstill obdurate. To go to Europe was out of the question.\n\n\"Now listen to reason, Dan. If you wait for the opportunity to go to\nEurope, you'll wait in vain. You must make the opportunity. One must\nhave youth to enjoy Italy thoroughly. The desire to go becomes less and\nless as one grows older. Besides, it completes every man's education; it\nbroadens his charity and smooths down the rough edges of his conceit.\nI'll put the proposition in a way you can't possibly get round. You've\nsimply got to go. You will always have that thousand, so don't worry\nabout that. You have twenty-five hundred on hand, you say. With that you\ncan see Italy like a prince for three months. I know the tongue and the\ncountry; I know what you would want to see, what to avoid, where to\nstop.\"\n\n\"What's the proposition?\" Merrihew drained the bottle.\n\n\"This: I'll agree to take not a penny more than twenty-five hundred\nmyself. We'll go on equal terms. Why,\" confidently, \"besides living like\na prince, you'll have four hundred to throw away at roulette. Boy, you\nhave never seen Italy; therefore you do not know what beauty is. When we\neventually land at Bellaggio, on Lake Como, and I take your lily-white\nhand in mine and lead you up to the terrace of Villa Serbelloni, and\norder tea, then you will realize that you have only begun to live.\nGardens, towering Alps, the green Lecco on one side and the green Como\non the other; and Swiss champagne at a dollar-forty the quart! Eh?\"\n\nMerrihew produced his black cigar. This matter needed some deep\nreflection, and could not be determined offhand. The ash turned white on\nthe end of the cigar before he replied.\n\n\"If you weren't Irish, you'd just naturally be Dago,\" he said with a\nlaugh. \"But it isn't fair to shoot me up this way, with flowery\nspeeches.\"\n\n\"And then, besides all these things,\" Hillard added, \"there's Kitty\nKilligrew, singing her heart out to a people who can't understand a word\nshe's singing. Kitty Killigrew!\"\n\n\"Can it be done for twenty-five hundred?\"\n\n\"He's melting!\" murmured Hillard jubilantly. \"He's melting!\"\n\n\"For a small amount I'd punch your head!\" Merrihew chewed his cigar with\nsubdued fierceness. He knew very well that he was destined to go to\nEurope. Kitty Killigrew, who had promised to mail the route they were to\nplay, and hadn't!\n\n\"It is written, Dan, that you shall go with me. Think of running into\nthe theater and seeing Kitty! I begin to like the music of that name.\"\n\n\"We'll settle this argument right here and now.\" Merrihew drew out a\ncoin. \"Call it!\" he cried recklessly.\n\n\"Heads!\"\n\nThe coin flickered in the light, fell, and proved that all money is\nperverse, by rolling under the davenport upon which they were sitting.\nAn amusing hunt followed. They ran their hands over the floor, turned\nthe rug, pulled out the davenport and looked behind, burnt innumerable\nmatches, and finally rang for the attendant. The situation was\nexplained, and he procured a candle. He was ultimately successful.\n\n\"Here it is, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't touch it!\" warned Hillard.\n\n\"What is it, head or tail?\" asked Merrihew weakly.\n\n\"Heads, sir,\" said the attendant, picking up the coin and offering it to\nthe owner.\n\n\"Keep it,\" said Merrihew generously, even sadly. He never got up a game\nof chance that he did not get the worst of it. And now, Italy! All that\nway from home! \"Boy, bring up a bottle of '96.\"\n\n\"Dan!\"\n\n\"You be still,\" said Merrihew savagely. \"You've roped me in nicely, and\nI'm game to go; but I'll have that bottle if I have to drink it all\nalone.\"\n\nBut he did not drink it all alone. Hillard was too wise to permit that.\nMerrihew might wish to add a few hundred to his letter of credit, via\nthe card-room.\n\n\"And the Lady in the Mask?\" asked Merrihew, as they at length stood up,\npreparatory to going down-stairs.\n\n\"I must relegate her to the fog she came out of. But it would be a\nfrightful thing if--if--\" He hesitated to form the words.\n\nBut Merrihew had no such scruple. \"If the silver and plate were missing\nwhen the Sandfords return?\"\n\n\"Oh, bosh! It's all some joke, and I'm the butt of it. She was in that\nhouse by the same authority she rode the horse.\"\n\n\"A woman of that sort would have no difficulty in hoodwinking the\nstablemen,\" declared Merrihew, certain that he had solved the riddle.\n\n\"And so you add forgery? Not a shred of my romance left!\" Hillard spoke\njestingly, but like a man who covers up a sudden twinge of pain.\n\n\"We'll know all about it in the fall. And ten to one, my theory will be\nthe correct one.\"\n\n\"That's better. I have some hope now. You never won a bet in all your\nlife.\"\n\n\"I know it; but this may be the one time. By the way, received a postal\nfrom Kitty this morning. From Gibraltar. Fine trip. Visited the\ngun-galleries and the antique furniture shops. Says no sign of prima\ndonna as yet, but believes her to be on board. O'Mally's on the\nwater-wagon. But Kitty aggravates me.\"\n\n\"What has she done now--refused you by Marconigraph?\"\n\n\"No; but she promised me her address.\"\n\n\"Address her care Cook's, Florence, Rome, Venice. It's the popular\nmail-box of Europe; and if she has given them the address, they will\nforward.\"\n\n\"That helps considerably. I'm glad there's one Cook which can be relied\non.\"\n\n\"In the morning I'll arrange for passage. We'll try the Celtic.\"\n\n\"I'll leave the business end of the trip to you.\"\n\n\"The first Saturday in March, then, if we can get booking. That will be\nin less than two weeks.\"\n\n\"I'm game. Shall I pack up my riding-breeches?\"\n\n\"Prepare for everything except automobiles.\"\n\n\"Bah! I wouldn't take one as a gift.\"\n\n\"You couldn't afford to, if what I hear about them is true. Though you\nmight be able to sell the gift and wipe out that thousand.\"\n\n\"Hang the thousand! I had almost forgotten it again.\"\n\nIn the lobby of the club, as they were about to enter the coat-room,\nHillard ran into one of several gentlemen issuing.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" he said, stepping aside.\n\n\"_Non un importa!_\" said the stranger with a graceful wave of the hands.\n\nHillard looked quickly into the gentleman's face. \"I am clumsy,\" he said\nin Italian.\n\nThen the other stared at him, and smiled. For a moment there was a brief\ntableau, in which each took the other's measure and noted the color of\nthe eyes. The man was an exceedingly handsome Italian, for all that a\nscar ran from his check to his chin. It was all over in a moment; and\nHillard and Merrihew proceeded to the street.\n\n\"Handsome duffer,\" was Merrihew's comment. \"But you never can tell a man\nby his looks. Gaze on me, for instance. I'm a good example of handsome\nis as handsome does.\" He was growing merry.\n\n\"Go home!\" Hillard slapped him jovially on the shoulder.\n\n\"Home? Ah, yes! But shall I have a home to go to when I get back? You\nhave roped me in nicely. My poor little twenty-five hundred! But Swiss\nchampagne at a dollar-forty the quart! Well, every cloud has its lining.\nSay, Jack, how much brighter the world looks after a magnum! And a funny\nstory's twice as funny. Good night. As for the Lady in the Fog, take the\ncash and let the credit go. That's my motto.\"\n\nAs Hillard never received any answer to his personal, he discontinued\nit. Truly, she had returned to the fog out of which she had come. But it\nwas no less difficult for him to take up the daily affairs again;\neverything was so terribly prosaic now; the zest was gone from work and\nplay. Italy was the last resort; and the business of giving Merrihew a\npersonally conducted tour would occupy his mind. Always he was asking:\nWho was she? What mystery veiled her? Whither had she gone? We never can\nconjure up a complete likeness. Sometimes it is the eyes, again the\nmouth and chin, or the turn of the throat; there is never any ensemble\nof features and adornments. And as for Hillard, he really had nothing\ndefinite to recall, unless it was the striking color of her hair or the\nmellow smoothness of her voice. And could he really remember these? He\noften wished that she had sung under any window but his.\n\nGiovanni was delighted when he heard the news. He would go, too, and act\nas valet to the signore and his friend till they put out for Rome. Then,\nof course, he would be obliged to leave them. Occasionally Hillard would\nreason with him regarding his deadly projects. But when a Latin declares\nthat he has seen through blood, persuasions, arguments, entreaties,\nthreats do not prevail. He comforted himself with the opinion, however,\nthat Giovanni's hunt would come to no successful end.\n\n\"You will surely fall into the hands of the police.\"\n\n\"What God wills comes true. But by this time they will have forgotten\nme.\"\n\n\"But you have not forgotten.\"\n\n\"_Padre mio_, that is different. One obeys the civil law from habit.\nBetween me and the _carabinieri_ there is nothing personal. Thus it is\neasy for them to forget. Still, I shall not announce my approach, that I\nam Giovanni l'Aguello, returned for arrest. I shall take good care to\nkeep out of their way.\"\n\n\"The eagle; that is a good name for you.\"\n\n\"And once I was as tame as a dove.\"\n\n\"But your man might be dead.\"\n\n\"He is not dead. If he were, something would tell me.\"\n\n\"It is a bad business, and I wish you no luck.\"\n\nGiovanni smiled easily. Wishes seldom interfere with any one.\n\n\"I will double your wages,\" said Hillard, \"if you will go where I go and\nreturn with me when I come back to America.\"\n\nA deprecating movement. \"Money? It is nothing. I am rich, after my\nkind.\"\n\n\"Are you still in the Church?\"\n\n\"I confess regularly once a week. Oh, I am a good Catholic.\"\n\n\"Take yourself off. I am displeased with you.\"\n\nThe few days before sailing found Merrihew in a flutter of intense\nexcitement. He carried his letter of credit about in order to convince\nhimself during the day that he was really and truly going to Italy. He\nforswore the bottle and the illumined royalty of the card-deck, and\nspent his evenings \"studying up\" the lay of the land. To be sure, there\nwas one grand dinner the night before they sailed. Suppose, Merrihew\nadvanced, for the sake of argument, suppose the ship went down or he\nnever came back, or he was ill all the way over? There would be one good\ndinner to remember, anyhow.\n\nIt was a drizzling, foggy morning when they drove down to the boat.\nThere are seldom bright sailing days in the forepart of March. But the\natmospheric effects made no impression on the volatile Merrihew. It was\nall very interesting to him. And he had an eye for all things, from the\nbaskets of fruit and flowers, messengers with late orders from the\nstores, repeated farewells, to the squalling babies in the steerage.\nEven in the impudent shrieking tugboats he found a measure of delight;\nand the blur on the water was inviting.\n\nAt four o'clock they were on the high seas, heading for the Azores.\nHillard was dreaming and Merrihew was studiously employed over a booklet\non _How to Speak Italian in One Day_. There was a moderate sea on.\n\nBy and by Giovanni, who had spent most of the time arranging the luggage\nin the adjoining staterooms, came up on deck. He had two packets of\nletters and telegrams. One he gave to Merrihew and the other to his\nmaster.\n\n\"I forgot to give the signore his mail at breakfast. The boat-mail has\njust been distributed.\" He then went forward.\n\nMerrihew was greatly pleased with his packet. There were humorous\nletters and cheery telegrams, containing all sorts of advice in case of\nseasickness, how to slip cigars through the customs, where to get the\nbest post-cards, and also the worst.\n\nHillard found among his a bulky envelope post-marked Naples. After he\nopened it he lay back in his chair and contemplated the ruffled horizon.\nNaples! He sat up. It had been addressed to the house and the address\ntypewritten.\n\n\"Dan?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Look at this!\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Dan gasped, his feet coming down to the deck.\n\nFor Hillard was holding up for his inspection a crumpled black silk\nmask.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWHAT MERRIHEW FOUND\n\n\nThe great ship had passed the Isle of Ischia, and now the Bay of Naples\nunfolded all its variant beauties. Hillard had seen them many times\nbefore, yet they are a joy eternal, a changing joy of which neither the\neye nor the mind ever grows weary. Both he and Merrihew were foremost in\nthe press against the forward rail. To the latter's impressionable mind\nit was like a dream. In fancy he could see the Roman galleys, the\nfighting triremes, the canopied pleasure-craft, just as they were two\nthousand years ago. Yonder, the temples and baths of Nero of the Golden\nHouse; thither, the palaces of the grim Tiberius; beyond, Pompeii, with\nGlaucus, lone, and Nydia, the blind girl. The dream-picture faded and\nthe reality was no less fascinating: the white sails of the fishermen\nwinging across the sapphire waters, leaving ribboned pathways behind\nthat crossed and recrossed like a chart of the stars; proud white\npleasure-yachts, great vessels from all ports in the world; and an\noccasional battle-ship, drab and stealthy. And the hundred pink and\nwhite villages, the jade and amethyst of the near and far islands, the\nsmiling terraces above the city, the ruined temples, the grim giant\nash-heap of Vesuvius!\n\n\"That is it,\" said Merrihew, whose flights of rhetoric were most\nsimplified.\n\n\"_Vedi Napoli e poi mori!_\" replied Hillard.\n\n\"Hold on,\" exclaimed Merrihew. \"Pass it out slowly. What's that mean?\"\n\n\"See Naples and die.\"\n\n\"I prefer to see it and live. But I am kind of disappointed in Vesuvius.\nIt's not the terrible old Moloch of my geographies that gobbled up\ncities and peoples. And nobody seems to be afraid of it,\" with a gesture\ntoward the villages nestling with the utmost confidence at the circling\nbase. \"Not a bit of smoke anywhere.\"\n\n\"No, my boy, don't speak slightingly of old Vesuvius. It is one of the\ngreat mysteries of the world. To-morrow that mountain may swallow up the\nwhole bay, or it may never wake up again. Respect it; I do. When I\nrecall Herculaneum and Pompeii--\"\n\n\"Two thousand years ago; that's different. I'm never satisfied, I know,\nbut I should like to see it blow its head off while I'm here.\"\n\n\"Not I! As I grow older I like comfort and security more and more. See\nthat village on the cliffs toward the south? That's Sorrento, where I\nwas born. The eruption of '72 happened while I was there, but I was too\nyoung to take any particular notice. Sh! Look at Giovanni.\"\n\nMerrihew looked at the old Roman. Tears were running down his cheeks,\nand his gaze strove to pierce the distance to the far-off Sabine Hills.\nItaly! Yonder his heart and soul had taken root; his native land, his\nnative land, and condemned to live in exile from it! Hillard leaned over\nand touched him on the arm, and he started.\n\n\"Take care, Giovanni.\"\n\n\"Pardon! I am weak this day, but to-morrow I shall be strong. Seven\nyears! Have you not longed for it yourself? Has not your heart gone out\nmany times across the seas to those cliffs?\" pointing to Sorrento.\n\n\"Many times, Giovanni. But remember and control yourself. Presently the\n_carabinieri_ will come on board. You will see that all our luggage goes\npromptly to the Bristol, once we are through the customs.\"\n\n\"Trust me, signore.\"\n\nThey landed at the custom-house at two in the afternoon, and passed\nwithout any difficulty. Naples is the easiest port in the world, if you\nare not a native and you chance to be an uncommercial traveler who is\nwilling to purchase salt and tobacco of the State. The Italian tobacco\nis generally bad, and formerly one had to smoke it or go without; but\nnow the best of imported cigars may be found in all the large cities,\ncheaper in some respects than those in America, and not a whit inferior,\nsince there is no middleman's profit, buying, as one does, direct from\nthe State. The hotels, however, sell the same brands at an outrageous\nadvance; the proprietor must have his commission, the concierge, the\nhead-waiter, the waiters, the porters, and the chef, for this slight\nfavor to the guest. Commission! It means something in sunny Italy. All\nthis Hillard explained to Merrihew as they were awaiting the\nexamination. Merrihew, holding grimly on to his hand-luggage, stood\nwaiting for Hillard at the iron gates fronting the railroad. Suddenly a\nbrilliantly uniformed man rushed up to him, bowed, and insisted on\ntaking the luggage. Merrihew protested feebly.\n\n\"But you are Meestaire Merrihoo, the friend of Meestaire Hil_lar_?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is all right, then.\" The brilliant uniform prevailed, and Merrihew\nsurrendered the luggage, marveling. Hillard seemed to know every one\nover here.\n\n\"Beautiful weather,\" said the uniform, as they passed through the gates.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Merrihew. From the corner of his eye he inspected the man\nat his side. Certainly he could be no less than a captain in the navy,\nwith those epaulets and sleeve-bands.\n\n\"This is your first trip to Italy?\"\n\n\"Yes. You people are very courteous here.\"\n\n\"Oh, we make that a part of our business.\"\n\nA hundred cabmen yelled and shouted; but at a sign from Merrihew's new\nacquaintance they subsided or turned their attention elsewhere. This\nsign of respect made a still deeper impression on Merrihew.\n\n\"I'll bet a dollar he's an admiral!\" he thought.\n\nAt length they came to an omnibus. The admiral beckoned to Merrihew to\nstep in. The luggage was thrown on top.\n\n\"I am very grateful to you,\" said Merrihew, offering his hand.\n\nThe admiral shook it somewhat doubtfully, tipped his cap, and went\nhurriedly back to the _dogana_, or custom-house.\n\nShortly after Hillard appeared.\n\n\"We shan't go up in the omnibus,\" he said. \"We'll take a carriage.\"\n\nMerrihew looked around in vain for his distinguished acquaintance.\n\n\"What did you give the porter?\" Hillard asked as they drove off.\n\n\"Porter? I didn't see any porter.\"\n\n\"Why, the chap who took your luggage from the customs.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! was that the porter? Why, I thought he was a personal friend\nof yours and an admiral in the Italian navy. I shook hands with him!\"\n\nHillard shouted with laughter.\n\nWhat a noisy, smelly, picturesque city it was! The cries of the hawkers,\nthe importunities of the guides, the venders and cabmen, the whining\nbeggars; the clatter of horses and carriages and carts; strolling\nsingers, goats with tinkling bells, the barking of outcast dogs, and the\nbrawling and bawling of children, hundreds upon hundreds of children!\nMerrihew grew dizzy trying to absorb the whole canvas at once. How the\nsturdy little campagna ponies ran up and down the narrow winding\nstreets! Crack-crack! went the driver's lash. It possessed a language\nall its own. It called, it warned at the turning of the corners, it\ngreeted friends, it hurled curses at rivals. Crack-crack! till\nMerrihew's ears ached. It was all very crowded and noisy till they\nreached the upper terrace of the Corso Vittorio; then the sounds became\nmurmurous and pleasing.\n\nTheir rooms were pleasantly situated, looking out upon the sparkling\nbay. Giovanni began at once to unpack the trunks, happy enough to have\nsomething to occupy him till after dark, when he determined to venture\nforth. The dreaded _carabinieri_ had paid him not the slightest\nattention; so far he was as safe as though he were in New York.\n\nIt was yet so early in the day that the two young men sallied forth in\nquest of light adventure. Besides, Merrihew was very eager to find some\nRoman and Florence newspapers. The American Comic Opera Company was\nsomewhere north. They found stationed outside the hotel a rosy-cheeked\ncabby who answered to the name of Tomasso, or Tomass', as the\nNeapolitans generally drop the finals. He carried a bright red lap-robe\nand blanket, spoke a little English, and was very proud of the\naccomplishment. He was rather disappointed, however, when Hillard\nbargained with him in his own tongue. He saw at once that there would be\nno imposing on the young _Americano_. The two harangued for a while, on\ngeneral principles. Twice words rose so high that Merrihew thought they\nwere about to come to blows. Tomass' shook his fingers under Hillard's\nnose and Hillard returned the compliment. Finally Tomass' compromised on\none-lira-fifty per hour, with fifty centesimi _pourboire_. Crack-crack!\nDown the hill they went, as if a thousand devils were after them.\n\n\"By George!\" gasped Merrihew, clutching his seat; \"the fool will break\nour necks!\"\n\n\"They are always like this,\" laughed Hillard. \"Slowly, slowly!\" he\ncalled.\n\nTomass' grinned and cracked his whip. He did not understand the word\nslowly in his own tongue or in any other; at least, not till he reached\nthe shops. It was business to go slowly there. A dozen times, on the Via\nRoma, Merrihew yelled that they would lose a wheel. But Tomass' knew the\ngame. A man on foot could not have eluded collisions more skilfully.\nMerrihew never saw such driving. Nor had he ever seen such shops. Coral,\ncoral, wherever the eye roamed. Where did they get it all and to whom\ndid they sell it? Necklaces, tiaras, rings, brooches, carved and\nuncarved; were there women enough in the world to buy these things?\n\n\"If I had a wife...\" he began.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I'd feel devilish sorry for her husband at this moment.\"\n\n\"But isn't the color great?\" said Hillard. It was good to be in Naples\nagain.\n\nIndeed, on a sunny afternoon, the traveler will find no other street\noffering such a kaleidoscope of luxuriant colors as the Via Roma of\nNaples. Behold the greens, the flowers, the cheeses, the shining fish,\nthe bakestuffs, the silver- and goldsmiths, the milliners, the\ncurio-dens! And the people! Dark-eyed beauties on foot or driving,\nhandsome bearded men, monks, friars, priests, an archbishop in his\nsplendid carriage, a duke driving tandem, nuns, and children. And\nuniforms as thick as poppies in a wheat-field. Officers rode past in\ntheir light blue capes, their gold and scarlet braids and polished\nscabbards; the foot-soldiers with their flowing green cock-feathers,\npolicemen with their short swords, the tall and dignified _carabinieri_\n(always in pairs) with their cocked hats and crimson pompons towering\nabove the sea of hats. It seemed to Merrihew that a rainbow had been\ncaptured and trained accordingly.\n\n\"I never saw so many kids,\" he observed; \"so many dirty ones,\" he added.\n\"Herod would have had his work cut out for him here. Now, where can we\nget some newspapers? I must know where she is.\"\n\n\"Presently,\" said Hillard. \"The Piazza dei Martin,\" he directed Tomass'.\nThen he turned to Merrihew solemnly. \"My boy, if you are to travel with\nme, beware of the Tauchnitz edition.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's good reading in paper-covers. It is easier to sit in the hotel all\nday and read Tauchnitz than it is to tramp through churches and\ngalleries and museums.\"\n\n\"No Tauchnitz; I promise.\" And Merrihew was an inveterate novel reader.\n\nAt the book-shop in the Piazza they found the Rome and Florence papers.\nHillard went through them thoroughly, but nowhere did he see anything\nrelative to the doings of the American Comic Opera Company.\n\n\"Not a line, Dan.\"\n\n\"But there must be something in the Florence paper. They should be\nplaying there yet.\"\n\n\"Nothing; these papers are two weeks old.\"\n\nMerrihew stared blankly at the sheet. \"I should like to know what it\nmeans.\"\n\n\"We will write to the consulate in Rome. If there has been any trouble\nhe will certainly notify us. I'll write to-night. Now, here's Cook's\nnext door. We'll ask if there is any mail for Kitty Killigrew.\"\n\nBut there wasn't, nor had there been; and the name was not on the\nforwarding books.\n\n\"Looks as if your Kitty were the needle in the haystack.\"\n\n\"Hang the luck!\" Merrihew jammed his hands into his pockets and sulked\nwith the world.\n\n\"It is evident that Kitty will not have you.\"\n\n\"Cut it!\" savagely. Pictures and churches and museums were all well\nenough, but Merrihew wanted Kitty Killigrew above all the treasures of\nearth. It was no longer a passing fancy; he was downright in love.\n\nWhen they turned down to the Via Caracciolo, with the full sweep of the\nmagnificent bay at their feet, Merrihew's disappointment softened\nsomewhat. It was the fashionable hour. The band was playing near-by in\nthe Villa Nazionale. Americans were everywhere. Occasionally a stray\nprincess or countess flashed by, inert and listless against the\ncushions, and invariably over-dressed. And when men accompanied them,\nthe men (if they were husbands) lolled back, even more listless. And\nbeggars of all sorts and descriptions besieged the \"very great grand\nrich Americans.\" To the Neapolitan all Americans are rich; they are the\nonly _forestieri_ who are always ready to throw money about, regardless\nof results. The Englishman, now, when the _poveretto_ puts out his\nunlovely hand, looks calmly over his head and drives on. The German (and\nin the spring there are more Germans in Italy than Italians!) is deep in\nhis Koran, generally, his Karl Baedeker, or too thrifty to notice. It is\nto the American, then, that the beggar looks for his daily macaroni.\n\nThey were nearly a week in Naples. They saw the galleries, the museums\nand churches; they saw underground Naples; they made the weary and\nuseless ascent of Vesuvius; and Merrihew added a new smell to his\ncollection every hour. Pompeii by moonlight, however, was worth a\nthousand ordinary dreams; and Merrihew, who had abundant imagination,\nbut no art with which to express it--happily or unhappily--saw Lytton's\nstory unfold in all its romantic splendor. In the dark corners he saw\nGlaucus, and Sallust, and Arbaces; he could hear the light step of the\nluxurious Julia, and the tramp of the gladiators; he could hear Ione's\nvoice in song and the low whisper of Nydia with her roses. \"To the\nlions! Glaucus to the lions!\" It would have been perfect had Vesuvius\nblown off the top of its head at that moment.\n\nThey lingered at Amalfi three days, and dreamed away the hours under the\nwhite pergola. Merrihew was loath to leave; but Hillard was for going on\nto Sorrento, for which his heart was always longing.\n\nA spring rain fell as they took the incline, and it followed them over\nthe mountains and down into Sorrento. The ruddy oranges hung in clusters\nover the old walls which lined both sides of the road, walls so old that\nhistory stops before them doubtfully. And the perfume of the sweet rain\nmingling with that of the fruit was like nothing Merrihew had ever\nsensed before. They finally drew up in the courtyard of the Hotel de la\nSirena, and the long ride was at an end. The little garden was white and\npink with roses and camellias, and the tubbed mandarins were heavy with\nfruit.\n\n\"And this is March!\" said Merrihew, his thought traveling back to his\nown bleak country, where winter is so long and summer is so short.\n\nTheir rooms were on the northeast corner, on the first floor; and from\nthe windows they could look down upon the _marina piccola_ and the\ntideless sea, a sheer hundred and fifty feet below. Everybody welcomed\nthe Signore Hillard; the hotel was his, and everything and everybody in\nit. Fire? It was already burning in the grate; orange wood, too, the\nsmoke of which leaves no strong acidulous odor on the air. The Signore\nHillard had only to speak, he had only to express a wish; they would\nscour the village to gratify it. Hillard accepted all these attentions\nas a matter of course, as a duke or a prince might have accepted them.\n\n\"By George!\" whispered Merrihew; \"they treat you like a prince here.\"\n\nLater, when they were alone, Hillard began to explain.\n\n\"They remember my father; he used to live like a prince in Sorrento.\nEvery time I come here I do the best I can to keep the luster to his\nname. To-morrow I shall point out to you the villa in which I was born.\nA Russian princess owns it now. You will know the place by the pet\nmonkey which is always clambering about the balconies near the porter's\nlodge. More than that, if the princess is not on the Riviera, I'll take\nyou there to tea some afternoon.\"\n\n\"A real live princess!\" said Merrihew. \"Is she beautiful?\"\n\n\"Once upon a time,\" returned Hillard, laughing. \"And, now, what do you\nsay to a game of penuchle till dinner, a penny a point?\"\n\nMerrihew found two decks of cards, arranged them, and the game began. It\nwas all very cheerful, the fire in the grate, the rain on the\ncasement-windows, the blur on the bay, and the fragrance of two\nwell-filled pipes.\n\nThere is very little to do in Sorrento at night; no theaters, no bands,\nno well-lighted caf\u00c3\u00a9s, nothing save wandering companies who dance the\ntarantella in the lobbies of the hotels, the men clumsy in their native\ncostumes and the girls with as much grace and figure as so many heifers.\nIt is only in Sicily that the Latin has learned to dance. But the\ntarantella is a novelty to the sight-seeing tourist, who believes he\nmust see everything in order to be an authority when he gets back home.\n\nGiovanni did not return till late that night, and on the morrow Hillard\nquestioned him.\n\n\"I have been to see a cousin,\" said Giovanni, \"who lives on the way to\nEl Deserta.\"\n\n\"Ah! So you have a cousin here?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore.\"\n\nHow old he looked, poor devil! Hillard had not taken particular notice\nof him during the past week's excursions. Giovanni had aged ten years\nsince they landed.\n\n\"And was this cousin glad to see you? And is he to be trusted?\"\n\n\"Both, signore. He had some news. She is--dancer in one of the Paris\nmusic-caf\u00c3\u00a9s.\"\n\nHillard kindled his pipe thoughtfully. And patiently Giovanni waited,\nknowing that shortly his master would offer some suggestion.\n\n\"Would you like me to give you the necessary money to go to Paris and\nbring her back to the Sabine Hills?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"I shall go to Paris, signore--after.\"\n\n\"You will never find him.\"\n\n\"Who can say?\"\n\n\"What is his name?\" Hillard had never till this moment asked this\nquestion.\n\n\"I know it; that is sufficient. He is high, signore, very high; yet I\nshall reach him. If I told you his name--\"\n\n\"There would be the possibility of my warning him.\"\n\n\"That is why I hesitate.\"\n\n\"You are a Catholic, Giovanni.\"\n\nGiovanni signified that he was.\n\n\"Does not the God of all Catholics, of all Christians, in fact, does He\nnot say that vengeance is His and that He will repay?\"\n\n\"But there are so many of us, signore, so many of us small and of slight\nimportance, that, likely enough, God with all His larger cares has not\nthe time to remember us. What may happen to him in the hereafter does\nnot concern me; for he will certainly be in the purgatory of the rich\nand I in the purgatory of the poor. It must be now, now!\"\n\n\"Go your own way,\" said Hillard, dismissing him; \"I shall never urge you\nagain.\"\n\nGiovanni gone, Hillard leaned against the casement. The sun was bright\nthis morning and the air was clear. He could see Naples distinctly.\nBelow, the fishermen and their wives, their bare feet plowing in the wet\nsands, were drawing in the nets, swaying their bodies gracefully.\nPresently the men in the boat landed the catch, and the net sparkled\nwith living silver. So long as Giovanni was with him, he would be\nmorally responsible for his actions. He would really be glad when the\ngrim old Roman took himself off on his impossible quest.\n\nHow the sight of this beach recalled his boyhood! How many times had he\nand his brilliant mother wandered over these sands, picking up the\nmany-colored stones, or baiting a young star-fish, or searching the\ncaverns of the piratical Saracens that honeycombed the clifts, or yet,\nagain, taking a hand at the nets! Sometimes he grew very lonely; for\nwithout a woman, either of one's blood or of one's choice, life holds\nlittle. Ah, that woman in the mask, that chimera of a night, that fancy\nof an hour!\n\nAnd then Merrihew burst in upon him, wildly excited, and flourished the\nhotel register.\n\n\"Look at this!\" he cried breathlessly. He flung the book on the table\nand pointed with shaking finger.\n\nHillard came forward, and this is what he saw:\n\n      Thomas O'Mally\n      James Smith\n      Arthur Worth\n      La Signorina Capricciosa\n      Kitty Killigrew\n    Am. Comic Opera Co., N.Y.\n\n\"Kitty has been here!\"\n\n\"Perfectly true. But I wonder.\"\n\n\"Wonder about what?\" asked Merrihew.\n\n\"Who La Signorina Capricciosa is. Whimsical indeed. She must be the\nmysterious prima donna.\"\n\nHe studied the easy-flowing hand, and ran his fingers through his hair\nthoughtfully. Then he frowned.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Merrihew curiously.\n\n\"Nothing; only I am wondering where I have seen that handwriting\nbefore.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMRS. SANDFORD WINKS\n\n\nA week in Sorrento, during which Merrihew saw all the beautiful villas,\ntook tea with the Russian princess, made a martyr of himself trying to\nacquire a taste for the sour astringent wines of the country, and bought\ninlaid-wood paper-cutters and silk socks and neckties and hat-bands,\nenough, in truth, to last him for several generations; another week in\nCapri, where, at the Zum Kater Hidigeigei, he exchanged compliments with\nthe green parrot, drank good beer, played _batseka_ (a game of\nbilliards) with the exiles (for Capri has as many as Cairo!) and beat\nthem out of sundry lire, toiled up to the ledge where the playful\nTiberius (see guide-books) tipped over his whilom favorites, bought a\nmarine daub; and then back to Naples and the friendly smells. His\nconstant enthusiasm and refreshing observations were a tonic to Hillard.\n\nAt the hotel in Naples they found a batch of mail. There was a letter\nwhich held particular interest to Merrihew. It was from the consul at\nRome, a reply to Hillard's inquiries regarding the American Comic Opera\nCompany.\n\n\"We'll now find out where your charming Kitty is,\" Hillard said,\nbreaking the seal.\n\nBut they didn't. On the contrary, the writer hadn't the slightest idea\nwhere the play-actors were or had gone. They had opened a two weeks'\nengagement at the Teatro Quirino. There had been a good house on the\nopening night; the remainder of the week did not show the sale of a\nhundred tickets. It was a fallacy that traveling Americans had any\ndesire to witness American productions in Italy. So, then, the managers\nof the theater had abruptly canceled the engagement. The American\nmanager had shown neither foresight nor common sense. He had, in the\nfirst place, come with his own scenery and costumes, upon which he had\nto pay large duties, and would have to pay further duties each time he\nentered a large city. His backer withdrew his support; and the\npercentage demanded by the managers in Florence, Genoa, Milan and Venice\nwas so exorbitant (although they had agreed to a moderate term in the\nbeginning) that it would have been nothing short of foolhardiness to try\nto fill the bookings. The singing of the prima donna, however, had\ncreated a highly favorable impression among the critics; but she was\nunknown, and to be unknown was next to positive failure, financially.\nThis information, the writer explained, had been obtained by personal\ninvestigation. The costumes and scenery had been confiscated; and the\nmanager and his backer had sailed for America, leaving the members of\nthe company to get back the best way they could. As none of the players\nhad come to the consulate for assistance, their whereabouts were\nunknown. The writer also advised Mr. Hillard not to put his money in any\nlike adventure. Italy was strongly against any foreign invasion, aside\nfrom the American trolley-car.\n\n\"That's hard luck,\" growled Merrihew, who saw his hopes go down the\nhorizon.\n\n\"But it makes me out a pretty good prophet,\" was Hillard's rejoinder.\n\"The Angel's money gave out. Too many obstacles. To conquer a people and\na government by light opera--it can't be done here. And so the American\nComic Opera Company at the present moment is vegetating in some little\n_pensione_, waiting for money from home.\"\n\nMerrihew gnawed the end of his cane. All his pleasant dreams had burst\nlike soap-bubbles. Had they not always done so? There would be no jaunts\nwith Kitty, no pleasant little excursions, no little suppers after the\nperformance. And what's a Michelangelo or a Titian when a man's in love?\n\n\"Brace up, Dan. Who knows? Kitty may be on the high seas, that is, if\nshe has taken my advice and got a return-ticket. I'll give you a dinner\nat the Bertolini to-night, and you may have the magnum of any vintage\nyou like. We'll have Tomass' drive us down the Via Caracciolo. It will\ntake some of the disappointment out of your system.\"\n\n\"Any old place,\" was the joyless response. \"Seems to me that Italy has\nall the cards when it comes to graft.\"\n\n\"America, my boy, is only in the primary department. Kitty's manager\nforgot the most important thing of the whole outfit.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"The Itching Palm. Evidently it had not been properly soothed. Come on;\nwe may run across some of our ship-acquaintances. To-morrow we'll start\nfor Rome, and then we shall add our own investigations to those of the\nconsul.\"\n\nThey had ridden up and down the Via Caracciolo twice when they espied a\nhuge automobile, ultramarine blue. It passed with a cloud of dust and a\nrumble which was thunderous. Hillard half rose from his seat.\n\n\"Somebody you know?\" asked Merrihew.\n\n\"The man at the wheel looked a bit like Sandford.\"\n\n\"Sandford? By George, that would be jolly!\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will come this way again. Tomass', follow that motor.\"\n\nSure enough, when the car reached the Largo Vittoria, it wheeled and\ncame rumbling back. This time Hillard had no doubts. He stood up and\nwaved his arms. The automobile barked and groaned and came to a stand.\n\n\"Hello, Sandford!\"\n\n\"Jack Hillard, as I live, and Dan Merrihew! Nell?\" turning to one of the\nthree pretty women in the tonneau. \"What did I tell you? I felt it in my\nbones that we would run across some one we knew.\"\n\n\"Or over them,\" his wife laughed.\n\nIn a foreign land one's flag is no longer eyed negligently and\ncarelessly, as though it possessed no significance; it now becomes a\nsymbol of the soil wherein our hearts first took root. A popular tune we\nhave once scorned, now, when heard, catches us by the throat; the merest\nacquaintance becomes a long-lost brother; and persons to whom we nod\nindifferently at home now take the part of tried and true friends. But\nwhen we meet an old friend, one who has accepted our dinners and with\nwhom we have often dined, what is left but to fall on his neck and weep?\nThere was, then, over this meeting, much ado with handshaking and\ncompliments, handshaking and questions; and, as in all cases like this,\nevery one talked at once. How was old New York? How was the winter in\nCairo? And so forth and so on, till a policeman politely told them that\nthis was not a private thoroughfare, and that they were blocking the\nway. So they parted, the two young men having promised to dine with the\nSandford party that evening.\n\n\"What luck, Dan!\" Hillard was exuberant.\n\n\"Saves you the price of a dinner.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of that. But I shall find out all about her\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The Lady in the Fog, the masquerading lady!\"\n\n\"Bah! I should prefer something more solid than a vanishing lady.\"\n\n\"Look here, Dan, I never throw cold water on you.\"\n\n\"There have been times when it would have done my head good.\"\n\nSandford knew how to order a dinner; and so by the time that Merrihew\nhad emptied his second glass of Burgundy and his first of champagne, he\nwas in the haze of golden confidence. He would find Kitty, and when he\nfound her he would find her heart as well.\n\n\"Say, Jack,\" said Sandford, \"what did you mean by that fool cable,\nanyhow?\"\n\nHillard had been patiently waiting for an opening of this sort. \"And\nwhat did you mean by hoaxing me?\"\n\n\"Hoaxing you?\"\n\n\"That's the word. I was in your house that night; I was there as surely\nas I am here to-night.\"\n\n\"Nell, am I crazy, or is it Jack?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Mrs. Sandford, \"when you put the chauffeur in the\ntonneau, I'm inclined to think that it is you.\"\n\nHillard looked straight into the placid grey eyes of his hostess. Very\nslowly one of the white lids drooped. His heart bounded.\n\n\"But really,\" continued Sandford seriously, \"unless you bribed the\ncaretaker, you could not possibly have entered the house. You have been\ndreaming.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; it begins to look as if I had.\" It was apparent to\nHillard that Sandford was not in his wife's confidence in all things. He\nalso saw the wisdom of dropping the subject while at the table. To take\nup the thread of that romance again! He needed no wine to tingle his\nblood.\n\nThey took coffee and liqueur in the glass-inclosed balcony. All Naples\nsparkled at their feet, and the young moon rose over the Sorrentine\nHills. Sandford and Merrihew and the other two ladies began an animated\nexchange of experiences. Hillard found a quiet nook, not far from the\nlift. He saw that Mrs. Sandford's chair was placed so that she could get\na good view of the superb night. He sat down himself, sipped his liqueur\nmeditatively, drank his coffee, and, as she nodded, lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"Well?\" she said, smiling into his brown eyes. She was rather fond of\nHillard; a gentleman always, and one of excellent taste. There was never\nany wearisome innuendo in his wit nor suggestion in his stories.\n\n\"You deliberately winked at me,\" he began.\n\n\"I deliberately did.\"\n\n\"Sandford is in the dark; I suspected as much.\"\n\n\"Regarding the wink?\"\n\n\"Regarding the mysterious woman who occupied your house by your express\nauthority, and who rode the hunter in the park.\"\n\n\"Was there ever a more beautiful picture?\" sweeping her hands toward the\ncity.\n\n\"The beauty of it will last several hours yet. Who and what was she?\"\n\n\"I wish I could find you a wife; you would make a good husband.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I am even willing, with your assistance, to prove it. Who\nwas she, and how came she in your house?\"\n\n\"She wished that favor, and that her presence in New York should not be\nknown. Now, describe to me exactly what happened. I am worrying about\nthe plate and the silver.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"And you will meet me half-way?\"\n\n\"I promise to tell you all I ... dare.\"\n\n\"There is a mystery?\"\n\n\"Yes. So begin with your side of it.\"\n\nHe was a capital story-teller. He recounted the adventure in all its\ncolor; the voice under his window, the personals in the paper, the\ninterchange of letters, the extraordinary dinner, the mask in the\nenvelope. She followed him with breathless interest.\n\n\"Charming, charming!\" She clapped her hands. \"And how well you tell it!\nYou have told it just as it happened.\"\n\n\"Just as it happened!\" confounded for a moment.\n\n\"Exactly. I have had a letter, two, in fact. You did not see her face?\"\n\n\"Only the chin and mouth. But if I ever meet her again I shall know her\nby her teeth.\"\n\n\"Heavens! And how?\"\n\n\"Two lower ones are gone; otherwise they would be beautiful.\"\n\n\"Poor man! You have builded your house upon the sands. Her teeth are\nperfect. She has fooled you.\"\n\n\"But I saw with these two eyes!\"\n\n\"There is a preparation which theatrical people use; a kind of gum. She\nmentioned the trick. Isn't she clever?\"\n\n\"Yet I shall know her hair,\" doggedly.\n\nShe put her hands swiftly to her head. \"Now, you have known me for\nyears. What is the color of my hair?\"\n\n\"Why, it is blond.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. It is auburn. If you can not tell mine, how will\nyou tell hers?\"\n\n\"I shall probably run after every red-headed woman in Europe till I find\nher,\" humorously.\n\n\"If you can keep out of jail long enough.\"\n\n\"I shall at any rate remember her voice.\"\n\n\"That is better. Our ears never deceive half so often as our eyes.\"\n\n\"Her face is not scarred, is it?\"\n\n\"Scarred!\" indignantly. \"She is as beautiful as a Raphael, as lovely as\na Bouguereau. If I were a man I should gladly journey round the world\nfor the sight of her.\"\n\n\"I am willing, even anxious.\"\n\n\"I should fall in love with her.\"\n\n\"I believe I have.\"\n\n\"And I should marry her, too.\"\n\n\"Even that.\"\n\n\"Come, Mr. Hillard; I am just fooling. You are too sensible a man to\nfall in love with a shadow, a mask. Your fancy has been trapped, that is\nall. One does not fall in love that way.\"\n\n\"You ought to know,\" with a sidelong glance at Sandford.\n\nAs her glance followed his, hers grew warm and kindly. Sandford, by\nchance meeting the look, smiled back across the room. This little\nby-play filled Hillard with a sense of envy and loneliness. At\nthree-and-thirty a bachelor realizes that there is something else in\nlife besides business and travel.\n\n\"It is quite useless to ask who she is?\" he inquired of his hostess.\n\n\"Quite useless.\"\n\n\"She is married?\"\n\n\"Certainly I have not said so.\"\n\nHe flicked the ash from his cigarette. What was the use of trying to\ntrap a woman into saying what she did not propose to say?\n\n\"Have you those letters?\"\n\n\"One of them I'll show you.\"\n\n\"Why not the other?\"\n\n\"It would be wasting time. It merely relates to your adventure. She\nsailed the day after you dined with her.\"\n\n\"That accounts for the shutters. The police and the caretaker were\nbribed.\"\n\n\"I suspect they were.\"\n\n\"If I were a vain man, and you know I am not, I might ask you if she\nspoke well of me in this letter. Understand, I am not inquiring.\"\n\n\"But you put the question as adroitly as a woman. We are sure of vanity\nalways. Yes, she spoke of you. She found you to be an agreeable\ngentleman. But,\" with gentle malice, \"she did not say that she wished\nshe had met you years ago, under more favorable circumstances, or that\nshe liked your eyes, which are really fine ones.\"\n\nHe had to join in her laughter.\n\n\"Come, give me the death-stroke and have done with it. Tell me what you\ndare, and I'll be content with it.\"\n\nShe opened her handkerchief purse and delved among the various articles\ntherein.\n\n\"I expected that you would be asking questions, so I came prepared. I\ndid not tell my husband for that very reason. He would have insisted\nupon knowing everything. Here, read this. It is only a glimpse.\"\n\nHe searched eagerly for the signature.\n\n\"Don't bother,\" she said. \"The name is only a nickname we gave her at\nschool.\"\n\n\"School? Do you mean to tell me that you went to school with her?\nWhere?\"\n\n\"In Pennsylvania first; then in Milan. Read.\"\n\n     O Cara Mia--If only you knew how sorry I am to miss you! Why must\n     you sail at once? Why not come to my beautiful Venice? True, I\n     could not entertain you as in the days of my good father. But I\n     have so much to say to you that can not be written. You ask about\n     the adventure. Pouf! goes my little dream of greatness. It was a\n     blank failure. Much as I knew about Italy I could not know\n     everything. The officials put unheard-of obstacles in our path. The\n     contracts were utterly disregarded. In the first place, we had not\n     purchased our costumes and scenery in Italy.\n\n\"Costumes and scenery?\" Hillard sought the signature again. Mrs.\nSandford was staring at the moonlit bay.\n\n     That poor manager! And that poor man who advanced the money! They\n     forgot that the booking is as nothing, the incidentals everything.\n     The base of all the trouble was a clerk in the consulate at Naples.\n     He wrote us that there would be no duties on costumes and scenery.\n     Alas! the manager and his backer are on the way to America, sadder\n     and wiser men. We surrendered our return tickets to the chorus and\n     sent them home. The rest of us are stranded--is not that the\n     word?--here in Venice, waiting for money from home. If I were\n     alone, it would be highly amusing; but these poor people with me!\n     There is only one way I can help them, but that, never. You\n     recollect that my personal income is quarterly, and it will be two\n     months before I shall have funds. I could get it advanced, but I\n     dare not. There are persons moving Heaven and earth to find me. My\n     companions haven't the least idea who I am; to them I am one of the\n     profession. So here we all are, wandering about the Piazza San\n     Marco, calling at Cook's every day in hopes of money, and\n     occasionally risking a penny in corn for the doves. I am staying\n     with my nurse, my mother's maid, in the Canipo Santa Maria Formosa,\n     near our beloved Santa Barbara. Very quietly I have guaranteed the\n     credit of my unfortunate companions, and they believe that\n     Venetians are very generous people. Generous! Think of it! Come to\n     Venice, dear; it is all nonsense that you must return to America.\n     Perhaps you will wonder how I dared appear on the stage in Italy. A\n     black wig and a theatrical make-up; these were sufficient. A duke\n     sent me an invitation to take supper with him, as if I were a\n     ballerina! I sent one of the American chorus girls, a little minx\n     for mischief. She ate his supper, and then ran away. I understand\n     that he was furious. Only a few months more, Nell, and then I may\n     come and go as I please. Come to Venice. Capricciosa.\n\nHillard did not stir. Another labyrinth to this mystery! Capricciosa;\nKitty Killigrew's unknown prima donna; and all he had to do was to take\nthe morning train for Venice, and twenty-four hours later he would be\nprowling through the Campo Santa Maria Formosa. Though his mind was busy\nwith a hundred thoughts, his head was still bent and his eyes riveted\nupon the page.\n\nMrs. Sandford observed him curiously, even sadly. Why couldn't his fancy\nhave been charmed by an every-day, sensible girl, and not by this\nwhimsical, extraordinary woman who fooled diplomats, flaunted dukes, and\nkept a king at arm's length as a pastime? And yet--!\n\n\"Capricciosa,\" he mused aloud. \"That is not her name.\"\n\n\"And I shall not tell it you.\"\n\n\"But her given name? Just a straw; something to hold on; I'm a drowning\nman.\" Hillard's pleadings would have melted a heart of stone.\n\n\"It is Hilda.\"\n\n\"That is German.\"\n\n\"She prefers it to Sonia.\"\n\n\"Sonia Hilda; it begins well. May I keep this letter?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. With that _cara mia_? Give it to me.\"\n\nHe did so. \"Shall I seek her?\"\n\n\"This is my advice: don't think of her after to-night. If you ever see\nor recognize her, avoid her. It may sound theatrical, but she is the\ninnocent cause of two deaths. These men sought her openly, too.\"\n\n\"What has she done?\"\n\n\"She made a great, though common, mistake.\"\n\n\"Political?\"\n\nHer lips closed firmly, but a smile lurked in the corners.\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"Don't be foolish. I am sorry I let you see the letter. I forgot that\nshe told me her hiding-place.\"\n\n\"Her hiding-place?\"\n\n\"Mr. Hillard, she is as far removed from your orbit as Mars' is from\nJupiter's. Forget her.\"\n\n\"My orbit is not limited. I shall seek her; when I find her I\nshall ... marry her.\"\n\nBut her lips closed again.\n\n\"Sphinx!\" he murmured with reproach.\n\n\"I like you too much, Mr. Hillard, to stand by and see you break your\nheart against a stone wall.\"\n\n\"Don't you see, the deeper the mystery is the more powerful the\nattraction becomes?\"\n\nThe door to the lift opened and closed noisily, and Hillard turned\nnegligently. A man sauntered through the room. The moment he came into\nthe light Hillard's interest became lively enough: It was the handsome\nItalian with the scar.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" he whispered. \"Only a few weeks ago I bumped into him\non coming out of the club.\"\n\nA swift glance, then her eyes grew unfriendly, her shoulders rigid and\nrepellent.\n\n\"Do not attract his attention,\" she answered in a low tone. \"Yes, I know\nhim, and I do not wish him to see me.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" he repeated.\n\n\"A Venetian officer, and a profligate. I entertained him once, but I\nlearned from him that I had been ill-advised.\"\n\nHillard saw that this subject would admit of no further questions. The\nman with the scar had committed some inexcusable offense, and Mrs.\nSandford had crossed him off the list. He knew that the Italian officer\nis, more or less, a lady's man; and the supreme confidence he has in the\npower of brass buttons and gold lace makes him at times insufferable.\n\nIt was after ten when Hillard and his friend took their leave. They\nwould not see their host and hostess again till they reached New York.\nUpon coming out on the Corso, Hillard whistled merrily.\n\n\"Pleasant evening,\" was Merrihew's comment.\n\nHillard continued to whistle.\n\n\"Good dinner, too.\"\n\nThe whistle went on serenely, in spite of Merrihew's obvious attempts to\nchoke it off.\n\n\"You seemed to have a good deal to say to Mrs. Sandford. She knows the\nlady who was in the house?\"\n\nStill the whistle.\n\n\"Say, wake up!\" cried Merrihew impatiently.\n\n\"We shall leave in the morning for Venice,\" said Hillard, taking up the\ntune again.\n\n\"Venice? How about Rome and Florence?\"\n\n\"Which would you prefer: Rome and the antiquities, or Venice and--Kitty\nKilligrew?\"\n\n\"Kitty in Venice? Are you sure?\"\n\n\"She is there with La Signorina Capricciosa. Oh, this is a fine world,\nafter all, and I was wrong to speak ill of it this morning.\"\n\n\"If Kitty's in Venice, I'm an ungrateful beggar, too. But I do not see\nwhy Kitty's being in Venice excites you.\"\n\n\"No? Well, fate writes that Kitty's mysterious prima donna and my Lady\nof the Mask are one and the same person.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nThe two, without further words, marched along the middle of the Corso to\nthe hotel, which was only a few steps away. They entered. The concierge\nstarted toward them as if he desired to impart some valuable\ninformation, but suddenly reconsidered, and retreated to his bandbox of\nan office and busied himself with the ever-increasing _debours_. The\nstrangeness of his movements passed unnoticed by the two men, who\ncontinued on through the lobby, turning into the first corridor. Hillard\ninserted his key in the door of his room, unlocked it, and swung it\ninward. This done, he paused irresolutely on the threshold, and with\ngood cause.\n\n\"What the devil can this mean?\" he whispered to Merrihew, who peered\nover his shoulder.\n\nTwo dignified _carabinieri_ rose quickly and approached Hillard. There\nwas something in the flashing eyes and set jaws that made him realize\nthat the safest thing for him to do at that moment was to stand\nperfectly still!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nCARABINIERI\n\n\n\"Signori,\" began Hillard calmly, \"before you act, will you not do me the\nhonor to explain to me the meaning of this visit?\"\n\n\"It is not he!\" said one of the _carabinieri_. \"It is the master, and\nnot the servant. This is Signore Hil_lar_, is it not?\" he continued,\naddressing himself to Hillard.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The signore has a servant by the name of Giovanni?\"\n\n\"Yes. And what has he done to warrant this visit?\" Hillard asked less\ncalmly.\n\n\"It is a matter of seven years,\" answered the spokesman. \"Your servant\nattempted to kill an officer in Rome. Luigi here, who was then\ninterested in the case in Rome, thought he recognized Giovanni in the\nstreet to-day. Inquiries led us here.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Hillard thought quickly. \"I am afraid that you have had your\ntrouble for nothing. Giovanni is now a citizen of the United States,\nunder full protection of its laws, domestic and foreign. It would not be\nwise for you to touch him.\"\n\nThe _carabinieri_ stared at each other. They shrugged.\n\n\"Signore, we recognize no foreign citizenship for our countrymen who,\nhaving committed a crime, return to the scene of it. We are here to\narrest him. He will be tried and sentenced. But it is possible that he\nmay be allowed to return to America, once he has been proved guilty of\nintent to kill.\"\n\nHillard flushed, but he curbed the rise in his temper. It was enough\nthat the United States was made the dumping-ground of the criminal\ncourts of Europe, without having it forced upon him in this\nsemi-contemptuous fashion. The _carabinieri_ saw the effort.\n\n\"The signore speaks Italian so well that he will understand that we have\nnothing to do with deportation. Our business is simply to arrest\noffenders against the State. It is to the State you must look for\nredress; and here the State is indifferent where the offender goes, so\nlong as it is far away.\" The speaker bowed ceremoniously.\n\n\"Yes, I understand. But I repeat, my servant is a legal citizen of the\nUnited States, and there will be complications if you touch him.\"\n\n\"Not for us. That rests between you and the State. Our orders are to\narrest him.\"\n\n\"At any rate, it looks as though Giovanni had been forewarned of your\nvisit. And may I ask, what is the name of the officer Giovanni attempted\nto kill?\"\n\n\"It is not necessary that you should know.\"\n\nHillard accepted the rebuke with becoming grace.\n\n\"And now, signore,\" with the utmost courtesy, \"permit us to apologize\nfor this intrusion. We shall wait in the hall, and if we find Giovanni\nwe shall gladly notify you of the event.\"\n\nThe two officers bowed and passed out into the corridor. Hillard raised\nhis hat, and closed the door.\n\n\"Now, what the deuce has all this powwow been about?\" demanded Merrihew;\nfor he had understood nothing, despite his _How to Speak Italian in One\nDay_.\n\n\"It's that rascal Giovanni.\"\n\n\"Did he find his man and cut him up?\"\n\n\"No. It seems that these carabinieri have remark-able memories; the old\naffair. Poor devil! I can't imagine how they traced him here. But I\nrepeatedly warned him about going abroad in the daylight. Hello, what's\nthis?\" going to the table. It was a note addressed to him; and it was\nfrom the fugitive.\n\n     My kind master--The _carabinieri_ are after me. But rest easy. I\n     was not born to rot in a dungeon. I am going north. As for my\n     clothes, send them to Giacamo, the baker, who lives on the road to\n     El Deserta. He will understand. May the Holy Mother guard you,\n     should we never meet again!\n\nHillard passed the note to Merrihew.\n\n\"That's too bad. I've taken a great fancy to him. It seems that the\npeasant has no chance on this side of the water. His child a painted\ndancer in Paris, and a price on his own head! It's hard luck. And the\nfellow who caused all this trouble goes free.\"\n\n\"He always goes free, Dan, here or elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Why, we'd have lynched him in America.\"\n\n\"That's possible. We are such an impulsive race,\" ironically. \"Yes, no\ndoubt we'd have lynched him; and these foreigners would have added\nanother ounce of fact to their belief that we are still barbarians.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" Merrihew admitted. Till now he had never\ncared particularly whether a foreigner's opinion was favorable or not.\n\n\"No, but when you start for home you will always think of it. Our\nreporters demand of the foreigner, barely he has stepped ashore, what he\nthinks of the United States; and then nearly every one he meets helps to\nform the opinion that we are insufferably underbred. Ours is not studied\nincivility; it is worse than that; it is downright carelessness.\"\n\n\"I am beginning to see things differently. When the concierge tips his\nhat, I tip mine. Since Giovanni is gone, suppose we pack up? There's\nlittle to do, as the trunks are as we left them. But I say, how is it\nthat all these _carabinieri_ we see are so tall? The Neapolitan is\ninvariably short and thick-set.\"\n\n\"They come from the north as far as Domo d'Ossola; mountaineers. Italy\nhas a good policy regarding her military police. The Neapolitan is sent\nnorth and the Venetian and Tuscan south, out of reach of family ties and\nfeuds. Thus, there is never any tug between duty and friendship. The\ntruth is, the Italian is less inclined toward duty than toward\nfriendship. This isolation makes the _carabinieri_ the right hand of the\narmy, and no other soldier in Europe is half so proud of his uniform,\nnot even the German. The people smile as they pass, you will notice\nalways in pairs; but when they are in trouble, these weather-vane\npeople, they fly straight to the _carabinieri_. Imagine the cocksureness\nand insolence we'd have suffered from two New York policemen, had we\nfound them in our homes! Oh, I have a soft spot for the _carabinieri_.\nYou will find no brigands in Italy now; that is because the\n_carabinieri_ are everywhere, silent, watchful, on highways, in the\nmountains, in all villages and in all stations. I have never seen one of\nthem ogle a woman. And never ask them where your hotel is, or the\nstation, or such and such a street. They will always tell you, but they\nsecretly resent it.\"\n\n\"I'll remember; but so far as I'm concerned, they'd have an easy time of\nit. Why, I couldn't ask a question in billboard Italian. Now, out with\nit; where and how did you learn that Kitty is in Venice?\"\n\nHillard told him briefly.\n\n\"And so they are all in Venice, broke? By George, here's our chance;\neverlasting gratitude and all that. We'll bail 'em out and ship 'em\nhome! How is that for a bright idea?\" Merrihew had regained his usual\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"Let me see,\" said Hillard practically. \"There are five of them: five\nhundred for tickets and doubtless five hundred more for unpaid hotel\nbills. It would never do, Dan, unless we wish to go home with them.\"\n\n\"But I haven't touched my letter of credit yet. I could get along on two\nthousand.\"\n\n\"Not with the brand of cigars you are smoking; a lira-fifty each.\"\n\n\"Well I'll try the native brand for a while, _Trabucos_.\"\n\n\"Not in my immediate vicinity,\" Hillard objected. \"No, we can't bail\nthem out, but we can ease up their bills till money comes from home. Not\none of them by this time will have a watch. O'Mally will remain sober\nfrom dire necessity. Poor Kitty Killigrew! All the wonderful shops and\nnot a stiver in her pockets!\"\n\n\"Aren't they the most careless lot, these professional people? They\nnever prepare for emergencies, and are always left high and dry. Instead\nof putting their cash in banks, they buy diamonds, with the idea that\nthey have always something convertible into cash at a moment's notice.\"\n\n\"Usually at one-third of what the original price was.\" Hillard threw off\nhis hat and coat and lighted his pipe.\n\nMerrihew paced the floor for some time, his head full of impossible\nschemes. He stopped in the middle of the room with an abruptness which\nportended something.\n\n\"I have it. Instead of going directly to Venice, we'll change the route\nand go to Monte Carlo. I'll risk my four hundred, and if I win!\"\n\n\"Then the announcement cards, a house-wedding, and pictures in the New\nYork papers. Dan, you are impossible. You have gambled enough to know\nthat when you are careless of results you win, but never when you need\nthe cash. But it is Monte Carlo, if you say so. Two or three days there\nwill cure you of your beautiful dream. After all,\" with a second\nthought, \"it's a good cause, and it might be just your luck to win. The\nmasquerading lady! I'll stake my word that there is comedy within\ncomedy, and rare good comedy at that. Monte Carlo it is.\"\n\nMerrihew danced a jig. Hillard stepped to the mirror and bowed\nprofoundly. The jig ceased.\n\n\"Madame, permit me, a comparative stranger, to offer you passage money\nhome. We won it at Monte Carlo; take it, it is yours. Polite enough,\"\nmused Hillard, turning and smiling; \"but hanged if it sounds proper.\"\n\n\"To the deuce with propriety!\" cried Merrihew buoyantly. \"We'll start,\nthen, at nine to-morrow?\"\n\n\"At nine promptly.\"\n\n\"I'm off to bed, then.\" As Merrihew reached the door he paused. \"I\nforgot to tell you. Do you recollect that Italian you ran into at the\nclub that night? Saw him at the hotel to-night. He bowed to Sandford,\nand Sandford cut him dead. It set me thinking.\"\n\n\"The Sandfords entertained him somewhere, once upon a time, and he\nbehaved like a cad. I don't know what about, and I don't care.\"\n\n\"Humph! I hope Giovanni gets off safely.\"\n\n\"I think he will.\"\n\nWhen Merrihew had gone Hillard opened the shutters to clear the room of\nthe tobacco smoke, and stood beside the sill, absorbing the keen night\nair and admiring the serene beauty of the picture which lay spread\nbefore him. The moon stood high and clear now, the tiled roofs shone\nmistily, and from some near-by garden came the perfume of boxwood and\nroses. All was silence; noisy Naples slept. He would see her face this\ntime; he would tear aside the mystery. She had made a great mistake?\nThat was of small consequence to him. He could laugh at Mrs. Sandford's\nwarning. He was no green and untried youth; he was a man. Then he\nlaughed aloud. It was so droll. Here was Merrihew in love with the\nsoubrette, and he himself.... _Was_ he in love, or was only his fancy\ntrapped? A fine comedy! The soubrette and the prima donna! He closed the\nshutters, for the Neapolitan is naturally a thief, and an open window is\nas large as a door to him. He packed his cases, and this done, went to\nbed. For a time he could hear Merrihew in the adjoining room; but even\nthis noise ceased. Hillard fell asleep and dreamed that he and Giovanni\nwere being pursued by _carabinieri_ in petticoats and half-masks, that\nMerrihew had won tons of napoleons at Monte Carlo, and that Kitty\nKilligrew was a princess in disguise. Such is the vagary of dreams.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE CITY IN THE SEA\n\n\nFrom her window Kitty looked down on the Campo which lay patched with\nblack shadows and moonshine. A magic luster, effective as hoar-frost,\nenveloped the ancient church, and the lines of the eaves and the turns\nof the corners were silver-bright. How still at night was this fairy\ncity in the sea! Save for the occasional booming of bells--and in Italy\nthey are for ever and ever booming--and the low warning cry of the\ngondoliers, there was nothing which spoke of life, certainly not here in\nthe Campo Santa Maria Formosa. There were no horses clattering over the\nstone pavements, no trams, no omnibuses; the stillness which was of\npeace lay over all things. And some of this had entered Kitty's heart.\nShe was not deeply read, but nevertheless she had her share of poetical\nfeeling. And to her everything in the venerable city teemed with\nunexpressed lyric. What if the Bridge of Sighs was not true, or the fair\nDesdemona had not dwelt in a palace on the Grand Canal, or the Merchant\nhad neither bought nor sold in the shadow of the Rialto bridge?\nHistorians are not infallible, and it is sometimes easier and pleasanter\nto believe the poets.\n\nBut for one thing the hour would have been perfect. Kitty, ordinarily\nbrave and cheerful, was very lonesome and homesick. Tears sparkled in\nher eyes and threatened to fall at any moment. It was all very well to\ndream of old Venice; but when home and friends kept intruding\nconstantly! The little bank-account was so small that five hundred would\nwipe it out of existence. And now she would be out of employment till\nthe coming autumn. The dismal failure of it all! She had danced, sung,\nspoken her lines the very best she knew how; and none had noticed or\nencouraged her. It was a bitter cup, after all the success at home. If\nonly she could take it philosophically; like La Signorina! She shut her\neyes. How readily she could see the brilliant, noisy, friendly Broadway,\nthe electric signs before the theaters, the gay crowds in the\nrestaurants! It was all very fine to see Europe on a comfortable letter\nof credit, but to see it under such circumstances as these, that was a\ndifferent matter. To live in this evil-smelling old tenement, with\nseldom any delicacy to eat, a strange jabber-jabber ringing in one's\nears from morning till night, and to wait day after day for that letter\nfrom home, was not a situation such as would hearten one's love of\nromance. The men had it much easier; they always do. There was ever some\nplace for a man to go; and there were three of them, and they could talk\nto one another. But here, unless La Signorina was about--and she had an\nodd way of disappearing--she, Kitty, had to twiddle her thumbs or talk\nto herself, for she could understand nothing these people, kindly enough\nin their way, said to her.\n\nShe opened her eyes again, and this time the tears flowed unheeded. Of\nwhat use is pride, unless it be observed by others? She missed some one,\na frank, merry, kind-hearted some one; and it was balm to her heart to\nadmit it at last. Had he appeared to her at that moment, she must have\nfallen gratefully into his arms.\n\nAnd there were so many things she could not understand. Why should La\nSignorina always go veiled? Why should she hide her splendid beauty?\nWhere did she disappear so mysteriously in the daytime? And those\nsapphires, and diamonds, and emeralds? Why live here, with such a\nfortune hanging round her neck? Kitty forgot that, for the sake of\nsentiment, one will sometimes eat a crust when one might dine like a\nprince.\n\n\"Kitty?\" The voice came from the doorway. Kitty was startled for a\nmoment, but it was only La Signorina. Kitty furtively wiped her eyes.\n\n\"I am over here by the window. The moon was so bright I did not light\nthe lamp.\"\n\nLa Signorina moved with light step to the window, bent and caught\nKitty's face between her hands and turned it firmly toward the moon.\n\n\"You have been crying, _cara_!\"\n\n\"I am very lonely,\" said Kitty.\n\n\"You poor little homeless bird!\" La Signorina seized Kitty impulsively\nin her arms. \"If I were not--\" She hesitated.\n\n\"If you were not?\"\n\n\"If I were not poor, but rich instead, I'd take you to one of the\nfashionable hotels. You are out of place here, in this rambling old\nruin.\"\n\n\"Not half so much as you are,\" Kitty replied.\n\n\"I am never out of place. I can live comfortably in the fields with the\npeasants, in cities, in extravagant hotels. It is the mind, my dear, not\nthe body. My mind is always at one height; where the body is does not\nmatter much.\"\n\nThere was a subtle hauteur in the voice; it subdued Kitty's\ninquisitiveness. And no other woman had, till recently, accomplished\nthis feat. Kitty was proud, but there was something in her companion\nthat she recognized but could not express in words.\n\n\"Come!\" said the older woman. \"I myself am lonely and desperate\nto-night. I am going to throw away a precious bit of silver on a\ngondolier. We haven't been out three times together since we arrived.\nPerhaps it would have been better had we all remained in Rome; but there\nI could not have helped you. The band plays in the Piazza to-night. They\nare going to play light opera, and it will tone us both up a bit. More\nthan that, we'll have coffee at Florian's, if we can find a table.\nTo-morrow we may have to do without breakfast. But there's the old\nsaying that he who sleeps dines. _Avanti!_\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Kitty, drying the final tear, \"sometimes I am afraid\nof you.\"\n\n\"And wisely. I am often afraid of myself. I always do the first thing\nthat enters my head, and generally it is the wrong thing. Never mind.\nThe old woman here will trust us for some weeks yet.\" She leaned from\nthe window and called. \"Pomp-_e_-o!\"\n\nFrom the canal the gondolier answered.\n\n\"Now then!\" said the woman to the girl.\n\nKitty threw a heavy shawl over her head and shoulders, while the other\nwound about her face the now familiar dark grey veil; and the two went\ndown into the Campo to the landing. Kitty longed to ask La Signorina why\nshe invariably wore that veil, but she did not utter the question,\nknowing full well that La Signorina would have evaded it frankly.\n\nPompeo threw away his cigarette and doffed his hat. He offered his elbow\nto steady the women as they boarded; and once they were seated, a good\nstroke sent the gondola up the canal. The women sat speechless for some\ntime. At each intersection Pompeo called right or left musically.\nSometimes the moon would find its way through the brick and marble\nca\u00c3\u00b1on, or the bright ferrule of another gondola flashed and disappeared\ninto the gloom. Under bridges they passed, they glided by little\nrestaurants where the Venetians, in olden days, talked liberty for\nthemselves and death to the Austrians, and at length they came out upon\nthe Grand Canal where the Rialto curves its ancient blocks of marble and\nstalactites gleam ghostly overhead.\n\n\"There, this is better.\"\n\n\"It is always better when you are with me,\" said Kitty.\n\nFor years Kitty had fought her battles alone, independent and\nresourceful; and yet here she was, leaning upon the strong will of this\nremarkable woman, and gratefully, too. It is a pleasant thing to shift\nresponsibility to the shoulders of one we know to be capable of bearing\nit.\n\n\"Now, my dear Kitty, we'll just enjoy ourselves to-night, and on our\nreturn I shall lay a plan before you, and to-morrow you may submit it to\nthe men. It is as usual a foolish plan, but it will be something of an\nadventure.\"\n\n\"I accept it at once, without knowing what it is.\"\n\n\"Kitty Killigrew,\" mused La Signorina. \"The name is as pretty as you\nare. Pretty Kitty Killigrew; it actually sings.\" Then she added\nsolemnly: \"Never change it. There is no man worth the exchange.\"\n\nKitty was not wholly sure of this, so she made no response.\n\n\"What a beautiful palace!\" she cried presently, pointing to a house in\ndarkness, not far from the house of Petrarch. It was only the interior\nof the house that was in darkness. The moon poured broadly upon it. The\nleaning gondola-posts stood like sleeping sentinels, and the tide\nmurmured over the marble steps.\n\nPompeo, seeing Kitty's gesture and not understanding her words, swung\nthe gondola diagonally across the canal.\n\n\"No, no, Pompeo!\" La Signorina spoke in Italian. \"I have told you never\nto go near that house without express orders. Straight ahead.\"\n\nThe gondola at once resumed its former course. Never did Pompeo take a\ntourist down the Grand Canal that he did not exalt in his best Italian\nand French the beauties of yonder empty palace. Had he not spent his\nyouth in the service of the family? It was only of late years that\nPompeo had become a public gondolier, with his posts in the stand\nfronting the Hotel de l'Europe.\n\n\"_A-oel!_ Look out!\" he called suddenly. Another gondola scraped\nalongside and passed on.\n\n\"Who lives there?\" asked Kitty.\n\n\"Nobody,\" answered La Signorina. \"Though once it was the palace of a\ngreat warrior. How picturesque the gondolas look, with their dancing\ndouble lights! Those without numbers are private.\"\n\n\"The old palace interests me more than the gondolas,\" declared Kitty.\n\nBut La Signorina was not to be trapped.\n\nPresently they passed the row of great hotels, with their balconies\nhanging over the water and their steps running down into it. Kitty eyed\nthem all regretfully. She saw men and women in evening dress, and she\nwas sure that they had dined well and were happy. Without doubt there\nwere persons who knew her by name and had seen her act. From the Grand\nCanal they came out into the great Canal of San Marco, the beginning of\nthe lagoon. Here Kitty forgot for the moment her troubles; her\ndream-Venice had returned. There were private yachts, Adriatic liners,\nall brilliant with illumination, and hundreds of gondolas, bobbing,\nbobbing, like captive leviathans, bunched round the gaily-lanterned\nbarges of the serenaders. There was only one flaw to this perfect dream:\nthe shrill whistle of the ferry-boats. They had no place here, and their\npresence was an affront.\n\n\"How I hate them!\" said La Signorina. \"The American influence! Some day\nthey will be filling up the canals and running trams over them. What is\nbeauty and silence if there be profit in ugliness and noise?\"\n\n\"La Signorina--\" began Kitty.\n\n\"There! I have warned you twice. The third time I shall be angry.\"\n\n\"Hilda, then. But I am afraid whenever I call you that. You do not\nbelong to my world.\"\n\n\"And what makes you think that?\" There was a smile behind the veil.\n\n\"I do not know, unless it is that you are at home everywhere, in the\nCampo, in the hotels, in the theater or the palace. Now, I am at home\nonly in the theater, in places which are unreal and artificial. You are\na great actress, a great singer; and yet, as O'Mally would say, you\ndon't belong.\" Kitty had forgotten what she had started out to say.\n\nLa Signorina laughed. \"Pouf! You have been reading too many novels. To\nthe _molo_, Pompeo.\"\n\nAt the _molo_, the great quay of Venice, they disembarked. The whilom\nprima donna dropped fifty centesimi into Pompeo's palm, and he bowed to\nthe very gunwale of the boat.\n\n\"_Grazie, nobilit\u00c3\u00a0._\"\n\n\"What does he say?\" asked Kitty.\n\n\"He says, 'Thanks, nobility.' If I had given him a penny it\nwould have been thanks only. For a lira he would have added\n_principessa_--princess. The gondolier will give you any title you\ndesire, if you are willing enough to pay for it. We shall return on\nfoot, Pompeo; this will be all for the night.\"\n\nPompeo lifted his hat again, and pushed off.\n\n\"He was very cheap,\" said Kitty. \"Only ten cents for a ride like that!\"\n\nA ripple of laughter greeted this remark. \"Pompeo can read human nature;\nhe knows that I am honest. What I gave him was a tip.\"\n\n\"Aren't you laughing at me sometimes?\"\n\n\"Disabuse your mind of that fancy, _cara_. It is a long time since I\ngave my affections to any one, and I do give them to you.\" With this she\ncaught Kitty by the arm, and the two went up the Piazzetta leisurely\ntoward the Piazza.\n\nThe Piazza San Marco, or Saint Mark, is the Mecca of those in search of\nbeauty; here they may lay the sacred carpet, kneel and worship. There is\nnone other to compare with this mighty square, with its enchanting\nsplendor, its haunting romance, its brilliant if pathetic history.\nLight, everywhere light; scintillating, dancing, swinging light! Spars\nand lances of light upon the shivering waters, red and yellow and white!\nLight, the reflective radiance of jewels and happy eyes! Light, breaking\nagainst the pink and white marbles, the columns of porphyry, malachite,\nbasalt, and golden mosaics! Let the would-be traveler dream of it never\nso well; he will come to find his dreams vanquished. Nothing changes in\nthe Piazza San Marco, nothing save the tourists and the contents of the\nbewildering shops; all else remains the same, a little more tarnished by\nthe sea-winds and the march of the decades, perhaps, but still the same.\nRead your poets and study your romances, but delve into no\ndisillusioning guide-books. Let us put our faith in the gondolier; for\nhis lies are far more picturesque than a world of facts.\n\nThere were several thousand people in the square to-night, mostly\ntravelers. The band was playing selections from Audran's whimsical _La\nMascotte_. The tables of the many caf\u00c3\u00a9s were filled, and hundreds walked\nto and fro under the bright arcades, or stopped to gaze into the\nshop-windows. Here the merchant seldom closes his shop till the band\ngoes home. Music arouses the romantic, and the romantic temperament is\nalways easy to swindle, and the merchant of Venice will swindle you if\nhe can.\n\nThe two women saw no vacant tables at Florian's, but presently they\nespied the other derelicts--O'Mally, Smith, and Worth--who managed to\nfind two extra chairs. They learned that O'Mally had had two beers, a\nvast piece of recklessness. He was ripe for anything, and gaily welcomed\nhis fellow unfortunates. He laughed, told funny stories, and made\nhimself generally amusing. Smith made weak attempts to assist him. On\nthe other hand, Worth seldom smiled and rarely spoke.\n\nThrough her veil their former prima donna studied them carefully, with a\npurpose in mind. The only one she doubted was Worth. Somehow he annoyed\nher; she could not explain, yet still the sense of annoyance was always\nthere. It might have been that she had seen that look in other eyes, and\nthat it usually led to the same end. She could not criticize his\nactions; he was always the perfection of courtesy to her, never\noverstepped, never intruded.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" she said during a lull, \"I have a plan to propose to you\nall.\"\n\n\"If it will get us back to old Broadway before we are locked up for\ndebt, let us have it at once, by all means,\" said O'Mally.\n\n\"Well, then, I propose to wait no longer for letters from home. The last\nboat brought nothing; it will be fourteen days before the next arrives,\nsince you all tell me that you wrote to have your mail sent by the\nMediterranean. My plan is simple. They say that a gambler always wins\nthe first time he plays. Taking this as the golden text, I propose that\neach of you will spare me what money you can, and Kitty and I will go to\nMonte Carlo and take one plunge at the tables.\"\n\n\"Monte Carlo!\" O'Mally brought down his fist resoundingly. \"That's a\ngood idea. If you should break the bank, think of the advertisement when\nyou go back to New York. La Signorina Capricciosa, who broke the bank at\nMonte Carlo, will open at the--\"\n\n\"Be still,\" said Worth.\n\n\"Dash it, business is business, and without publicity there isn't any\nbusiness.\" O'Mally was hurt.\n\n\"Mr. O'Mally is right,\" said La Signorina. \"It would be a good\nadvertisement. But your combined opinion is what I want.\"\n\nThe three men looked at one another thoughtfully, then drew out their\nwallets, thin and worn. They made up a purse of exactly one hundred and\nfifty dollars, not at all a propitious sum to trap elusive fortune. But\nsuch as it was, O'Mally passed it across the table. This utter\nconfidence in her touched La Signorina's heart; for none of them knew\naught of her honesty. She turned aside for a moment and fumbled with the\nhidden chain about her neck. She placed her hand on the table and opened\nit. O'Mally gasped, Smith opened his mouth, and Worth leaned forward. An\nemerald, a glorious green emerald, free from the usual cluster of\ndiamonds, alone in all its splendor, lay in the palm of her hand.\n\n\"I shall give this to you, Mr. O'Mally,\" said the owner, \"till I return.\nIt is very dear to me, but that must not stand in the way.\"\n\n\"Ye gods!\" cried O'Mally in dismay. \"Put it away. I shouldn't sleep o'\nnights with that on my person. Keep it. You haven't the right idea.\nWe'll trust you anywhere this side of jail. No, no! It wouldn't do at\nall. But you're a brick all the same.\" And that was as near familiarity\nas O'Mally ever came.\n\nShe turned to Smith, but he put out a hand in violent protest; then to\nWorth, but he smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"O'Mally is right,\" he said. \"We need no guaranty.\"\n\nShe put the ring away. It was her mother's. She never would smile in\nsecret at these men again. They might be vain and artificial and always\ntheatrical, but there was nevertheless a warm and generous heart\nbeneath.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said quietly. \"If I lose your money we will all go to\nFlorence. I have another plan, but that will keep till this one under\nhand proves a failure. None of you shall regret your confidence in me.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said O'Mally.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Smith.\n\nAnd Worth smiled reassuringly.\n\nO'Mally beckoned to a waiter. \"_Oony_ bottle _vino dee Asti, caldo,\nfrapp\u00c3\u00a9_!\" he said loudly, so that all might hear him give the order. A\nmonth in Venice, and he would be able to talk like a native. True, if\nany Italian spoke to him, he was obliged to shake his head; but that was\na trifling matter.\n\n\"Tom!\" warned Smith.\n\n\"You let me alone,\" replied O'Mally. \"A quart of Asti won't hurt\nanybody.\"\n\nSo the thin sweet wine of Asti was served, and La Signorina toasted them\nall gratefully.\n\nEarly the next morning she and Kitty departed for Monte Carlo in quest\nof fortune. Fortune was there, waiting, but in a guise wholly\nunexpected.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA BOX OF CIGARS\n\n\nOn the way up to Rome Hillard and his pupil had a second-class\ncompartment all to themselves. The train was a fast one; for the day of\nslow travel has passed in Italy and the cry of speed is heard over the\nland. The train stopped often and rolled about a good deal; but the\ncushions were soft, and there was real comfort in being able to stretch\nout full length. Hillard, having made this trip many times, took the\nforward seat and fell into a doze.\n\nMerrihew was like a city boy taking his first trip into the country. He\nhung out of the window, and smoked and smoked. Whenever the train swept\nround a curve he could look into the rear carriages; and the heads\nsticking out of the thirds reminded him of chicken-crates. Never had he\nseen such green gardens, such orange and lemon groves, such forests of\nolives. Save that it was barren rock, not a space as broad as a man's\nhand was left uncultivated; and not a farm which was not in good repair.\nOne saw no broken fences, no slovenly out-houses, no glaring\nadvertisements afield: nobody was asked impertinently if Soandso's soap\nhad been used that morning, nor did the _bambini_ cry for\nsoothing-syrups. Everything was of stone (for wood is precious in\nItaly), generally whitewashed, and presenting the smiling countenance of\ncomfort and cleanliness. The Italian in the city is seldom clean; there,\nit is so easy to lie in the gutters under the sun. Reared and bred in\nlaziness for centuries, dirt has no terrors, but water has. With his\nbrother in the country it is different. Labor makes him self-respecting.\nMerrihew had seen so many dirty Sicilians and Neapolitans working on\nAmerican railways that he had come to the conclusion that Italy was the\nmost poverty-stricken country in the world. He was now forming new\nopinions at the rate of one every hour.\n\nHow pretty were the peasants in the fields with their bright bits of\ncolor, a scarlet shawl, a skirt of faded blue, a yellow kerchief round\nthe head! And the great white oxen at the plows! Sometimes he saw a\nstrange, phantom-like, walled town hanging to some cliffs far away. It\ndisappeared and reappeared and disappeared again. Never a chimney with\nthe curling black smoke of the factory did he see above any of these\nclustered cities. When he recalled to mind the pall of soft-coal smoke\nwhich hangs over the average American city, he knew that while Italy\nmight be cursed with poverty she had her blessing in fine clear skies.\nAnd always, swinging down the great roads, he saw in fancy the ghosts of\narmies, crusaders, mercenaries, feudal companies, crossbowmen, and\nknights in mail.\n\nIt amused him to see the buxom women flagging the train at crossings.\nAnd the little stations, where everybody rushed out to buy a drink of\nbottled water! Suddenly the station-master struck a bell, the conductor\ntooted a horn, and the engine's shrill whistle shrieked; and off they\nflew again. No newsboy to bother one with stale gum, rank cigars,\nancient caramels and soiled novels; nothing but solid comfort. And oh!\nthe flashing streams which rushed under bridges or plunged alongside.\nMerrihew's hand ached to hold a rod and whip the green pools where the\nfallen olive leaves floated and swam like silver minnows. Half a dozen\ntimes he woke Hillard to draw his attention to these streams. But\nHillard disillusioned him. Rarely were there any fish, nor were these\nwaters drinkable, passing as they did over immense beds of lime.\n\nThere was a change of cars at Rome and a wait of two hours. Hillard led\nthe way to a popular caf\u00c3\u00a9 in the Piazza delle Terme, near the station.\nHere they lunched substantially. In that hour or so Merrihew saw more\nvaried uniforms than he had seen in all his past life; perambulating\nparrakeets which glittered, smoked cigarettes or black cigars with\nstraws in them, and drank coffee out of tumblers. He readily imagined\nthat he was surrounded by enough dukes and princes and counts to run a\ndozen kingdoms, with a few left over for the benefit of the American\nmarket. He was making no mistakes now; he could distinguish a general\nfrom a hotel concierge without the least difficulty.\n\nAnd still Americans, everywhere Americans; rich and poor Americans, loud\nand quiet Americans; Americans who had taste and education, and some who\nhad neither; well-dressed and over-dressed, obtrusive and unobtrusive,\nparvenu and aristocrat. Once Merrihew saw a fine old gentleman wearing\nthe Honor Legion ribbon in his buttonhole, and his heart grew warm and\nproud. Here was an order which was not to be purchased like the Order of\nLeopold and the French Legion of Honor. To win this simple order a man\nmust prove his courage under fire, must be the author of an heroic\nexploit on the battle-field. And besides, there was this advantage: to\nservants in Europe a button or a slip of ribbon in the lapel signifies\nan order, a nobility of one sort or another, and as a consequence they\ntreat the wearer with studied civility.\n\n\"I wish I had remembered,\" sighed Merrihew, after gazing at the old\ngentleman.\n\n\"Remembered what?\"\n\n\"Why, I've got a whole raft of medals I won at college. I could wear\nthem quite handily over here.\"\n\n\"Buy an order. Any pawnshop will have a few for sale. You could wear it\nin Switzerland or France, and nobody would be any the wiser.\"\n\n\"But I'm serious.\"\n\n\"So am I.\"\n\nMerrihew brightened, reached into a vest pocket, and to Hillard's horror\nproduced a monocle, which he gravely screwed in his eye.\n\n\"Where the--\"\n\n\"Sh! If you make me laugh I'll drop it.\"\n\nMerrihew stared about calmly and coldly, as he had seen some Englishmen\ndo. A waiter, seeing the sun flash on the circle of crystal, hurried\nover, firmly believing he had been heliographed.\n\n\"_Niente_,\" said Merrihew, waving him aside. \"You see?\" he whispered to\nHillard, who was rather amused at this tomfoolery. \"Brings 'em without a\nword. Hanged if I don't wear it the rest of the trip. There's a\ncertain--whatdyecallit?--eclaw about the demmed thing.\"\n\n\"Wear it, by all means. You'll be as amusing as a comic weekly. But if\nyou ever drop it, I'll step on it accidentally.\"\n\n\"I can keep it in my eye all right,\" said Merrihew, \"so long as I don't\nlaugh. Now, while there's time, let us see some of the sights; the\nGolden House of Nero, for instance, and the Forum, the Colosseum, St.\nPeter's and the Vatican; just a passing glance at a few things, as it\nwere.\" Merrihew as he spoke kept a sober countenance.\n\nIt deceived Hillard, who eyed him with unfeigned wonder, marveling that\nany rational mind should even think of such a thing, much less propose\nit.\n\n\"Why not run up to Venice and back?\" he inquired sarcastically.\n\n\"Is it as far as that?\" innocently. \"Well, we'll make it just St.\nPeter's and the Vatican.\"\n\n\"Impossible! In the hour we have left we can see nothing, positively\nnothing. And even now we had better start for the station to get a\ncompartment before the rush. St. Peter's and the Vatican! You talk like\nthe Englishman who wanted to run over to San Francisco and back to\nPhiladelphia in the morning.\"\n\nA grin now spread over Merrihew's face. Hillard scratched his chin\nreflectively.\n\n\"I'll pay for the luncheon myself,\" he said.\n\n\"You had better. It was great sport to watch your face. I'll be in a\nhappy frame of mind all day now.\"\n\nAfter luncheon Merrihew secretly bought two boxes of cigars to carry\nalong. They were good cigars and cost him fifteen dollars. He covered\nthem with some newspapers, and at the station succeeded by some\nlegerdemain in slipping them into one of his cases. Hillard would have\nlectured him on his extravagance, and this was a good way to avoid it.\nBut some hours later he was going to be very sorry that he had not made\na confidant of his guide. Merrihew had never heard of the town of\nVentimiglia, which straddles the frontiers of France and Italy. As they\nwere boarding the train they noticed two gentlemen getting into the\nforward compartment of the carriage.\n\n\"Humph! Our friend with the scar,\" said Hillard. \"We do not seem able to\nshake him.\"\n\n\"I'd like to shake him. He goes against the grain, somehow.\" Merrihew\nswung into the compartment. \"I wonder why the Sandfords dropped him?\"\n\n\"For some good reason. They are a liberal pair, and if our friend\nforward offended them, it must have been something deliberate and\noutside the pale of forgiveness. But I should like to know where old\nGiovanni is. I miss him.\"\n\n\"Poor devil!\" said Merrihew with careless sympathy. It is easy to be\nsympathetic with persons whose troubles are remote from our own.\n\nThe train started, and again they had the compartment.\n\n\"Monte Carlo! Gold, gold, little round pieces of gold!\" Merrihew rubbed\nhis hands like the miser in _The Chimes of Normandy_.\n\n\"Hard to get and heavy to hold!\" quoted Hillard. \"I suppose that you\nhave a system already worked out.\"\n\n\"Of course. I shall win if I stick to it.\"\n\n\"Or if the money lasts. Bury your system, my boy. It will do you no\ngood. Trust to luck only. Monte Carlo is the graveyard of systems.\"\n\n\"But maybe my system is the one. You can't tell till I have tried it.\"\n\nMerrihew lighted a cigar, and Hillard smiled secretly. After some time\nthe conductor came in to examine the tickets. When the examination was\nover he paused in front of Merrihew, who puffed complacently.\n\n\"Signore,\" the conductor said politely, \"_e vietato fumare_.\"\n\nMerrihew replied with an uncomprehending stare.\n\n\"_Non fumer!_\" said the conductor, with his hand at the side of his\nmouth, as one does to a person who is suddenly discovered to be hard of\nhearing.\n\nMerrihew smiled weakly and signified that he did not understand.\n\n\"_Nicht rauchen!_\" cried the official in desperation.\n\nMerrihew extended his hands hopelessly. He had nothing belonging to the\nconductor. Hillard had the tickets.\n\n\"_Niet rooken! Niet rooken!_\"\n\n\"I say, Jack, what the deuce does he want, anyhow?\"\n\n\"_Cigare, cigare!_\" The conductor gesticulated toward the window.\n\n\"Oh!\" Merrihew took the cigar from his teeth and went through the\npantomime of tossing it out of the window.\n\n\"_Si, si!_\" assented the conductor, delighted that he was finally\nunderstood.\n\n\"You might have given me the tip,\" Merrihew grumbled across to Hillard.\nHe viewed the halfburnt perfecto ruefully and filliped it through the\nwindow. \"How should I know smoking was prohibited?\"\n\n\"You had your joke; this is mine. Besides, I remained silent to the\nadvantage of your future education. The conductor has spoken to you in\nfour languages--Italian, French, German and Dutch.\" Hillard then spoke\nto the conductor. \"May not my friend smoke so long as ladies do not\nenter?\"\n\n\"Certainly, since it does not annoy you.\" Then the conductor bowed and\ndisappeared into the next compartment.\n\nMerrihew inscribed on the back of an envelope, for future reference, the\nfour phrases, and in ten minutes had, with the assistance of his\npreceptor, mastered their pronunciations.\n\n\"I wish I had been born a hotel concierge,\" he said mournfully. \"They\nspeak all languages, and the Lord knows where they find the time to\nlearn them.\"\n\n\"The Englishman, the Parisian and the American are the poorest\nlinguists,\" said Hillard. \"They are altogether too well satisfied with\nthemselves and their environments to bother learning any language but\ntheir own, and most Americans do not take the trouble to do that.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\"\n\n\"It is because I am a good patriot that I complain,\" said Hillard. \"I\nlove my country, big, healthy and strong as it is; but I wish my people\nwould brush up their learning, so that these foreigners would have less\nright to make sport of us.\"\n\n\"There's some truth in what you say. But we are young, and going ahead\nall the time.\"\n\nSoon the train began to lift into the mountains, the beautiful\nApennines, and Merrihew counted so many tunnels he concluded that this\nwas where the inventor of the cinematograph got his idea. Just as some\nmagnificent valley began to unfold, with a roar the train dashed into a\ndank, sooty tunnel. One could neither read nor enjoy the scenery;\nnothing to do but sit tight and wait, let the window down when they\npassed a tunnel, lift it when they entered one. By the time they arrived\nin Genoa, late at night, both compared favorably with the coalers in the\nharbor of Naples.\n\nThe English and American tourists have done much toward making Italy a\nsoap-and-water tolerating country (loving would be misapplied). But in\nItaly the State owns the railroads. There is water (of a kind), but\nnever soap or towels.\n\nEarly the next morning the adventurers set out for Monte Carlo, taking\nonly their hand-luggage. More tunnels. A compartment filled with women\nand children. And hot besides. But the incomparable beauty of the\nRiviera was a compensation. Ventimiglia, or Vintimille, has a sinister\nsound in the ears of the traveler, if perchance he be a man fond of his\ntobacco. A turbulent stream cuts the town in two. On the east side\nstands a gloomy barn of a station; on the other side one of the most\npicturesque walled towns in Europe, and of Roman antiquity. The train\ndrew in. A dozen steps more, and one was virtually in France. But there\nis generally a slight hitch before one takes the aforesaid steps: the\nFrench customs. A _facchino_ popped his head into the window.\n\n\"Eight minutes for examination of luggage!\" he cried.\n\nHe held out his arms, and Hillard piled the luggage upon him.\n\n\"Come, Dan; lively, if we want good seats when we come out. We change\ntrains.\"\n\nThe two men followed the porter to the ticket entrance, surrendered\ntheir coupons, and passed into the customs. The porter had to go round\nanother way. After a short skirmish they located their belongings, which\nunfortunately were far down toward the end of the barrier. They would\nhave to be patient. Hillard held in his hands his return coupons to\nGenoa. Sometimes this helps at the frontier; and if one has a steamer\nticket, better still. Inspectors then understand that one is to be but a\ntransient guest.\n\nAmong the inspectors at Ventimiglia is a small, wizened Frenchman, with\na face as cold and impassive as the sand-blown Sphinx. He possesses\namong other accomplishments a nose, peculiar less for its shape than for\nits smell. He can \"smell out\" tobacco as a witch doctor in Zululand\nsmells out a \"devil.\" Fate directed this individual toward the\nAmericans. Hillard knew him of old; and he never forgets a face, this\nwizened little man.\n\n\"Monsieur has nothing to declare?\" he asked.\n\nHillard made a negative sign and opened his cases. With scarce a glance\nat their contents, and waving aside the coupons, the inspector applied\nthe chalk and turned to Merrihew.\n\n\"Monsieur has nothing to declare?\" he repeated.\n\nMerrihew shook his head airily. \"_Niente, niente!_\" he said in his best\nItalian. He did not understand what the inspector said; he merely had\nsuspicions.\n\n\"Look!\" suddenly exclaimed Hillard.\n\nPassing out of the door which led to liberty and to France, their\nluggage guaranteed by cabalistic chalk marks, were two women. One of\nthem was veiled, the other was not.\n\n\"Kitty Killigrew, as I live!\" shouted Merrihew, making a dash for the\ndoor.\n\nBut the inspector blocked the way, beckoned to a gendarme, who came\nover, and calmly pointed to Merrihew's unopened cases.\n\n\"Open!\" said the inspector, all his listlessness gone. He had seen\npeople in a hurry before.\n\n\"But--\" Merrihew struggled to pass.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake!\" cried Hillard, \"be patient and open the cases at\nonce.\"\n\nMerrihew handled his keys clumsily. The first key on the ring should\nhave been the last, and the last first. It is ever thus when one is in a\nhurry. Finally he threw back the lids, feeling that in another moment he\nmust have spouted Italian or French out of pure magic, simply to tell\nthis fool inspector what he thought of him.\n\n\"Oho! Monsieur-in-a-hurry!\" mocked the inspector. \"Nothing, nothing!\" He\ntook out the two boxes of cigars.\n\n\"Why the devil didn't you tell me you had them?\" Hillard demanded\nwrathfully. To find the women by this stroke of luck, and then to lose\nthem again for two boxes of cigars! It was maddening!\n\nAs a matter of fact, Merrihew had forgotten all about them, so far as\nintentional wrong-doing was concerned.\n\nThe inspector went through Merrihew's possessions with premeditated\nleisure. Everything had to come out. He even opened the shaving sets,\nthe collar box, the pin cases, and the tie bag. Other persons pushed by\ntoward the train, uttering their relief aloud. Still the inspector\ndoddered on. \"Will you hasten?\" asked Hillard. \"We do not wish to miss\nthis train.\"\n\n\"Others follow,\" said the inspector laconically.\n\nHillard produced a five-franc piece. The inspector laughed without noise\nand shook his head. This one inspector is impervious to money or smooth\nspeeches. He is the law personified, inexorable.\n\n\"Tell him to keep the cigars, but let us go!\" Merrihew begged.\n\nNo, that would not do. Monsieur had not declared the cigars. If he\npersisted, the government would confiscate the cigars, but in place of\nduty there would be a large fine. Monsieur had better be patient and pay\nthe duty only, retaining his valuable cigars. It was very liberal on his\n(the inspector's) part.\n\nHillard strained his eyes, but saw neither Kitty nor the veiled lady\nagain. Doubtless they were already on the train. Had Merrihew been an\nold traveler he would have left him to get to Monte Carlo the best way\nhe could; but Merrihew was as helpless as a child, and he hadn't the\nheart to desert him, though he deserved to be deserted.\n\nDing-ding! went the bell. Toot-toot! went the horn. Whee-whee! went the\nwhistle. The train for Monte Carlo was drawing out, and they were being\nleft behind. Hillard swore and Merrihew went white with impotent anger.\nIf only he could hit something! The inspector smiled and went on with\nhis deadly work. When he was certain that they could not possibly catch\nthe train, he chalked the cases, handed the cigars to their owner, and\npointed to a sign the other side of the barricade.\n\n\"What shall I do now, Jack?\" Merrihew asked.\n\n\"I refuse to help you. Find out yourself.\"\n\nSo Merrihew, hopeless and subdued, went into the room designated, saw\nthe cigars taken out and weighed, took the bill and presented it with a\nhundred-lire note at the little window in the off-room. The official\nthere pushed the money back indifferently.\n\n\"_Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise, Monsieur, fran\u00c3\u00a7aise!_\"\n\nMerrihew blinked at him. What _was_ the matter now? Was the note bad?\n\n\"_Change, cambio!_\" said the official testily. Would tourists never\nlearn anything?\n\nMerrihew got it through his head somehow where the difficulty lay. He\nwent out again, remembering the sign _Cambio_ hanging in front of the\nnews-stand. He lost half a dollar in the exchange, but for the time\nbeing his troubles were over.\n\nMeanwhile Hillard had made inquiries at the door. No, the official there\ntold him, he had not noticed the lady in the veil. So many passed; it\nwas impossible to recollect.\n\nAnd Merrihew found him sitting disconsolately on the barricade.\n\n\"I hope you are perfectly satisfied,\" said Hillard, with an amiability\nwhich wouldn't have passed muster anywhere.\n\n\"Oh, I'm satisfied,\" answered Merrihew. He stuffed his pockets with\ncigars, slammed the boxes into the case, and locked them up. He\ncollected his belongings and repacked the other case, keeping up a\nrumbling monotone as he did so. \"Oh, yes; I am damned satisfied.\"\n\n\"I warned you about tobacco.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"You should have told me.\"\n\n\"I know that, too; but I didn't want you to lecture me.\"\n\n\"A lecture would have been better than waiting here in this barn for\nthree hours.\"\n\n\"Three hours?\" despondently.\n\n\"Oh, there's a restaurant, but it's not much better than this. It's bad;\nflies and greasy plates.\"\n\nConversation died. For the first time in the long run of their\nfriendship there was a coolness between them. However, their native\nsense of humor was too strong for this coolness to last. Merrihew was\nfirst to break the silence.\n\n\"Jack, I _am_ an ass!\" penitently.\n\n\"I admit it,\" said Hillard, smiling.\n\n\"Let's hunt up the restaurant; I am hungry and thirsty.\"\n\nAnd by the time they had found the Ristorante Tornaghi--miserable and\nuninviting--they were laughing.\n\n\"Only, I wish I knew where they were going,\" was Hillard's regret.\n\n\"They?\" said Merrihew.\n\n\"Yes. The woman with Kitty is the woman I'm going to find if I stay in\nEurope ten years. And when I find her, I'm going to marry her.\"\n\n\"Sounds good,\" said Merrihew, pouring himself a third glass of very\nindifferent Beaune.\n\n\"And they may be going anywhere but to Monte Carlo--Paris, Cherbourg,\nCalais. In my opinion, Monte Carlo is the last place two such women are\nlikely to go to alone.\"\n\n\"Have a cigar,\" Merrihew urged drolly. \"I paid fifteen cents apiece for\nthem in Rome. They are now four for a dollar. And I suppose that I'll\nhave to smoke them all up in Monte Carlo, or the Italian end of this\nruin will sink the harpoon into me for fifty more francs. I'd like to\nget that blockhead over the line. I'd customs him.\"\n\n\"Don't blame him. He is to be admired. He is one of the rarities of\nEurope--an honest official.\"\n\nSo they sat in the dingy restaurant, smoking and laughing and grumbling\ntill the next train was announced. At four that afternoon they arrived\nwithout further mishap at the most interesting station of its size in\nEurope--Monte Carlo. And Merrihew saw gold whichever way he looked: in\nthe sunshine on the sea, in the glistening rails, in the reflecting\nwindows of the many-terraced hotels, in the orange trees; gold, gold,\nbeautiful gold napoleons.\n\nAnd then, into the omnibus adjoining, came the man with the scar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nKITTY ASKS QUESTIONS\n\n\nThe Riviera, from San Remo on the Italian side to Cannes on the French,\npossesses a singular beauty. Cities and villages nestle in bays or crown\nfrowning promontories; and sheltered from northern winds by mountains\nrugged and lofty, the vegetation is tropical and rich. Thousands of\nsplendid villas (architectural madnesses) string out along the\nrock-bound coast; and princes and grand dukes and kings live in some of\nthese. Often a guide will point out some little palace and dramatically\nwhisper that this will be the villa of a famous ballerina, or Spanish\ndancer, or opera singer, or some duchess whose husband never had any\nduchy. And seldom these villas are more than a stone's throw from the\nvillas of the princes and grand dukes and kings. Nobility and royalty\nare fond of jovial company. Aladdin's lamp is not necessary here, where\none may build a villa by the aid of one's toes!\n\nNature--earthly nature--has nothing to do with the morality of humanity,\nif it can not uplift. Yet humanity can alter nature, beautify it after a\nconventional manner, or demolish it, still after a conventional manner.\nOn the Riviera humanity has nature pretty well under hand.\n\nVillefranche stands above Nice, between that white city and Monte Carlo.\nIt is quiet and lovely. For this reason the great army of tourists pass\nit by; there is no casino, no band, no streets full of tantalizing\nshops. On the very western limit of Villefranche, on the winding white\nroad which rises out of Nice, a road so frequently passed over by\nautomobiles that a haze of dust always hangs over it, is a modest little\nvilla, so modest that a ballerina would scorn it and a duchess ignore\nit. It is, in truth, a _pensione_, where only those who come well\nrecommended are accepted as guests. It is on the left of the road as you\nride east, and its verandas and window balconies look straight out to\nsea, the eternally blue Mediterranean. A fine grove of shade trees\nprotects it from the full glare of the sun.\n\n[Illustration: In the balcony La Signorina reposed in a steamer chair]\n\nIn the balcony La Signorina reposed in a steamer chair, gazing seaward.\nThe awning cast a warm glow as of gold upon her face and hair, a\ntransparent shadow. She was at this moment the most precious thing upon\nwhich the eye may look--a wholly beautiful woman. Kitty Killigrew,\nstanding in the casement window, stared at her silently, not without\nsome envy, not without some awe. What was going on behind those dreamy\neyes? Only once did the woman in the chair move, but this movement was\ntense with passion: she clenched her hands and struck them roughly on\nthe arms of the chair. Immediately she relaxed, as if realizing how\nfutile such emotion was. Kitty stirred and came out. She sat in the\nneighboring chair.\n\n\"Hilda?\" said Kitty.\n\n\"Yes, Kitty.\"\n\n\"Who and what are you?\" Kitty asked bravely.\n\nLa Signorina's eyes wandered till they met Kitty's. There was neither\nanger nor surprise in the glance, only deliberation.\n\n\"And what good would it do you to know? Would it change our positions\nany? Would it bring money from home any sooner? You already know,\nwithout my telling you, that I am unhappy. The adventuress always is.\"\n\n\"Adventuress?\" Kitty laughed scornfully. \"The proprietor pretends he\ndoes not know you, but I am certain he does. He forgets himself\nsometimes in the way he bows to you. He has even called you _altezza_,\nwhich you tell me is Italian for highness.\"\n\n\"He is in hope of a liberal tip.\"\n\n\"The proprietor? One does not tip him.\"\n\n\"That is true. I can not understand his motive, then.\"\n\n\"If he also applied the title to me, it would be different. He rarely\nnotices me. Won't you tell me what the secret is?\"\n\n\"How beautiful that white sail looks!\"\n\n\"You know all about me,\" went on Kitty stubbornly.\n\n\"Because you told me. I never asked you a single question.\"\n\n\"And you have told me nothing.\"\n\n\"Why should I? Come, Kitty, be reasonable. Tell me what you think of\nthat sail. Is it not beautiful in the sunset?\"\n\n\"Is it--love?\"\n\n\"Love?\" La Signorina shrugged. \"Poor Kitty, you are trying in vain to\nmake a romance out of my life. What should I know of love? It is a myth,\na fable, only to be found in story-books. You should not read so much.\"\n\n\"It is not curiosity,\" declared Kitty. \"It is because I love you, and\nbecause it makes me sad when I hear you laugh, when I see you beat your\nhands against the chair as you did just now.\" There was a tremble in\nKitty's voice that suggested the nearness of tears.\n\nLa Signorina turned again, in a passion which was as fierce as it was\nsudden.\n\n\"There _is_ a man,\" she whispered rather than spoke, the pupils in her\neyes dilating so that the blue irises nearly disappeared. \"But I loathe\nhim, I hate him, I abhor him! And were it not wicked to kill, he would\nhave been dead long ago. Enough! If you ever ask another question, I\nwill leave you. I like you, but I insist that my secrets shall be my\nown, since they concern you in no manner.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Kitty with contrition. \"But I suspected there was a\nman. I understand. He was false to you and broke your heart,\"\nromantically.\n\n\"No, Kitty; only my pride.\"\n\n\"It is a strange world,\" mused Kitty.\n\n\"It would be otherwise were it not that the heart and the mind are\nalways at war. But let us turn to our affairs. I received a letter\nto-day.\"\n\n\"From home?\" eagerly.\n\n\"I have no home, Kitty. The letter is from a friend in Naples. Mr.\nHillard and Mr. Merrihew, friends of yours, are in Italy.\"\n\nKitty could scarce believe her ears. \"Where are they? Where are they\nstopping?\"\n\n\"That I do not know. But listen. They have started out to find us. When\nI tell you that Mr. Hillard is the gentleman I dined with that night\nbefore we sailed, you will understand my reasons for wishing to avoid\nhim. From this time on we must never appear on the streets without our\nveils. If by chance we meet them, we must give no sign. It will be only\nfor a little while. Your letter will come soon, and you may renew your\nacquaintance with these two gentlemen when you return home. It may be\nhard for you; but if you wish to stay with me, my will must be a law\nunto you.\"\n\n\"Not to speak to them if we meet them?\" urged Kitty in dismay.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But that is cruel of you. They are both gentlemen,\" said Kitty, with\nfierce pride.\n\n\"I do not know Mr. Merrihew, but I can say that Mr. Hillard is a\ngentleman. I have proved that. As for being cruel, I am not; only\nselfish.\"\n\n\"Are you not a queen who has run away from a kingdom?\" asked Kitty\nbitterly. \"One reads about them every day in the papers.\"\n\n\"My dear, you are free to choose one of two paths. Sometimes I need you,\nKitty; and the sight of you and the knowledge of your nearness helps me.\nI shall not urge you one way or the other, but you must make your final\nchoice at once.\"\n\nSeveral minutes passed. Kitty looked out to sea, and La Signorina closed\nher eyes. In her heart Kitty knew that she could no more leave this\nwoman than she could fly. She was held by curiosity, by sentiment, by\nthe romantic mystery.\n\n\"I have chosen,\" she said at length. \"I shall stay with you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Kitty. And now, the affairs of the company. We have played\nthree days and have lost steadily. To-night will be the last chance. Win\nor lose, to-morrow we shall return to Venice. I do not like the idea of\ngoing to Monte Carlo at night; it is not exactly safe. But since beggars\nmustn't be choosers, we must go. Again I warn you to speak to no one\nwhile I am playing; and under no circumstance raise your veil. They have\nbegun to notice us, but it will end to-night. I was mad to think that I\ncould win. And by the way, Kitty, we shall not go back to the Campo\nFormosa.\"\n\nKitty accepted this news brightly. If there was one place she hated, it\nwas the Campo. She had never been so lonely in all her days as in that\nevil-smelling tenement in the Campo Santa Maria Formosa.\n\n\"Now run and dress,\" advised La Signorina. \"Let me dream a little more,\nwhile the sun sets. I can dream a pleasant dream sometimes.\"\n\nAnd indeed the dream was not unpleasant, for her thoughts went back to\nthat night in New York. Did he really think of her, then? Was it\npossible for a man to forget so bizarre an episode? Rather would it not\nleave a lasting impression? She liked him. He had a clean, kindly face\nand handsome eyes. How she had played with him! How she had tempted him!\nAnd yet, through it all, a gentleman, a witty, interesting, amiable\ngentleman, who never approached the innuendo, or uttered a\ndouble-meaning. On her part she had taken great risks; but the fun had\nbeen merry and harmless.\n\nShe recalled his liberal-minded patriotism and his sensible comparisons.\nSurely he was right: the race of gentlemen had not yet died out in far\nAmerica. With what mystery had he invested her? With what charms had he\nendued her? She smiled gently. It was pleasant to be made a heroine even\nfor the small space of two hours. He was an idle young man, after a\nfashion; that was because he had not been waked up. But under his jest\nand under his laughter she was sure that there was courage and purpose\nand high emprise. Take care! she thought. Take care! Might not this\nlittle dream carry her too far out to sea?... To have met a man like\nthis one in time! How gracefully, how boyishly, he had kissed her hand!\nMore than this, there had been an artless admiration in his upturned\neyes, an expression which a gentleman of the Old World would have\nlacked. Why had she sent him that mask? Had it been a challenge, an\nindirect challenge, daring him to follow and seek her? She really could\nnot answer. It had been one of those half-conscious whims which may be\nassigned to no positive cause. Besides, no sensible man would have\naccepted such a challenge. She knew men tolerably well: after thirty\nthey cease to follow visions; they seek tangible things. . . . No, they\nmust never meet again. It would not be wise. Her heart, lonely,\ndisappointed, galled as it were by disillusion, might not withstand much\nstorming. And she had no wish to add this irretrievable folly to the\noriginal blunder. Too late, too late! Decidedly they must not meet\nagain. She was afraid.\n\nThe red rim of the sun sank quickly now, and the sea turned cold and\ndeeply blue, and the orange-tinted sails grew drab and lonely. And with\nthe sun the brightness of her dream went out. Would she never cast out\nthe life which was false, though colorful and fantastic? Would she never\naccept real life, dull and sober? Romance? She was always seeking it,\nknowing right well that it was never to be found. Romance! Had it not\nled her into this very pit from which only death could release her? This\nimpossible vein was surely the legacy of some far ancestor, some knight\nof the windmills, not of her father and mother, both so practical, so\nwise, so ambitious. Ah, she thought in her heart, had they but lived to\nsee the folly of what they believed to be wisdom!\n\nNo, they must go their separate ways till the end. When she was old she\nwould re-read his letters. With a sigh she rose and went into the room.\nKitty was busy with the finishing touches of her toilet. Kitty was not\nvain; she was only pretty. The older woman kissed her fondly.\n\n\"Pretty Kitty Killigrew!\" she said. \"It is positively lyrical.\"\n\n\"And do you realize that you are the most beautiful woman in the world?\"\n\n\"Little flatterer!\"\n\n\"And if I were a man--\" Kitty paused.\n\n\"Well, and if you were a man?\"\n\n\"I'd fall in love with you and marry you.\" La Signorina looked into the\nmirror.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nGREY VEILS\n\n\nThe fascination of Monte Carlo is not to be described; it must be seen.\nVice shall be attractive, says the Mother of Satan. At Monte Carlo it is\nmore than attractive; it is compelling. A subtle hypnotism prevails. One\nscarce realizes that this lovely spot is at the same time the basest.\nWhat passions have stormed this cliff! What rage and despair have beaten\ntheir hands against these bastions of pleasure! How few who plunge into\nthis maelstrom of chance ever rise again! The lure of gold, there is\nnothing stronger save death. Fool and rogue, saint and sinner, here they\nmeet and mingle and change. To those who give Monte Carlo but a trifling\nglance, toss a coin or two on the tables, and leave by the morrow's\ntrain, it has no real significance; it is simply one of the sights of\nEurope.\n\nTo this latter class belonged the two young men. They had no fortunes to\nretrieve, no dishonesty to hide, no restitutions to make, no dancers to\nclothe and house. It was but a mild flirtation. They saw the silken gown\noutside rather than the rags beneath; they saw the smile rather than the\ntortured mind behind it.\n\nThey dined sumptuously at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Paris. They wandered about the\nsplendid terraces on the sea-front, smoking. They had grown accustomed\nto the many beautiful women, always alone, always with roving eyes.\nFrequently Merrihew longed to chat with this one or that; and sometimes\nhe rebelled against his inability to speak the maddening tongue.\nTo-night, though the dinner had been excellent and the chambertin all\nthat could be desired, the two were inclined to be moody. So far fortune\nhad not smiled, she had frowned persistently. They found a vacant bench\nand sat down.\n\n\"Ho-hum!\" said Merrihew, dangling his monocle to which he had attached a\nstring.\n\n\"Heigh-ho!\" replied Hillard.\n\n\"Curse those cigars!\"\n\n\"With all my heart!\"\n\nThey had searched Nice, and Monaco, and Mentone, but the women they\nsought were not to be found. They decided, therefore, that the women had\ngone on to Paris, and that there was now no hope of seeing them this\nside of the Atlantic. They had not entered the Casino during the day;\nthey had been too busy quizzing hotel porters and concierges along the\nRiviera.\n\n\"My system needs a tonic,\" said Merrihew.\n\n\"We'll hold the funeral after to-night's play. Of all the damfool games,\nit's roulette.\"\n\n\"And I can prove it,\" Merrihew replied. \"I have just fifty dollars\nleft.\" He took out the gold and toyed with it. \"Can't you hear it?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Hear what?\"\n\n\"The swan-song of these tender napoleons!\"\n\nMerrihew had played the numbers, the dozens, the columns, the colors,\nodd and even. Sometimes he would win a little, but a moment later the\nrelentless rake would drag it back to the bank. His chance to play the\ngood Samaritan to the derelicts of the American Comic Opera Company was\nfast approaching the dim horizon of lost opportunities. Presently he\nscrewed the monocle into his eye and squinted at the sea, the palaces on\nthe promontory, the yachts in the harbor, all tranquil in shadowy\nmoonlight.\n\n\"Nature has done this very prettily. Quite clever with her colors, don't\nyou know,\" he drawled, plucking the down on his upper lip, for he was\ntrying to raise a mustache, convinced that two waxed points of hair at\neach corner of his mouth would impress the hotel waiters and other\n_facchini_--baseborn.\n\n\"Don't be a jackass!\" Hillard was out of sorts.\n\n\"You agreed with me that I was one. Why not let me make a finished\nproduct?\" good-humoredly.\n\n\"You will have your joke.\"\n\n\"Yes, even at the expense of being blind in one eye; for I can't see\nthrough this glass; positive stove-lid. Every time I focus you, you grow\nas big as a house. No, I'd never be happy as a lord. Well, let us have\nour last fling. You might as well let me have my letter of credit now.\"\n\n\"You will not set eyes upon it till we return to Genoa. That's final. I\nknow you, my boy, and I know Monte Carlo. Even with your fifty, a watch\nand a ring, I'm afraid to trust you out of sight.\"\n\n\"I can see that you will never forgive nor forget--those cigars. Come\non. We'll take a look at our Italian friend. He's a bad loser. I have\nseen him lose his temper, too. It's my opinion that he's a desperate\nman.\"\n\n\"They usually are when they come to Monte Carlo.\"\n\nSo they walked round to the entrance to the gaming halls, where the\nlights, the gowns, the jewels, the sparkling eyes, the natural beauty\nand the beauty of enamel, the vague perfumes, the low murmur of voices,\nthe soft rustle of silks, the music of ringing gold, all combine to\nproduce a picture and ensemble as beautiful as a mirage and as false.\nNothing is real in Monte Carlo but the little pieces of gold and the\npassion to win them. The two renewed their tickets of admission and\npassed on into the famous atrium, stared a while at the news bulletin,\nwhereon all the important events of the day are briefly set forth, and\ngazed musingly at the bats darting across the ceiling, real bats, a\nsinister omen such as one sees in imaginative paintings of the Door of\nHades. At nine they joined the never-ending procession which passes in\nand out of the swinging doors day after day, year after year.\n\nThe faces one sees in the Hall of Roulette! Here and there one which\nwill haunt the onlooker through the rest of his days. Packed about the\nlong tables were young faces flushed with hope or grey with despair;\nmiddle-aged faces which expressed excitement or indifference; old, old\nfaces, scarred and lined and seamed, where avarice, selfishness,\ncruelty, dishonesty crossed and recrossed till human semblance was\nliterally blotted out. Light-o'-loves, gay and careless; hideous old\ncrones, who watched the unwary and stole the unwary's bets; old women in\nblack, who figured and figured imaginary winnings and never risked\nanything but their nerves. And there were beautiful women, beautifully\ngowned, beautifully gemmed, some of them good, some of them indifferent,\nand some of them bad. Invariably Hillard found himself speculating on\nthe history of this woman or that; the more gems, the more history. Here\nthe half-world of Europe finds its kingdom and rules it madly. The\nfortunes these women have poured into this whirligig of chance will\nnever be computed. And there was the gentlemanly blackleg, the\nticket-of-leave man, and outcasts and thieves; but all of them were well\ndressed, and, for the time being, well behaved.\n\nOccasionally Merrihew caught some daring beauty's eye, and usually there\nfollowed a conversation, familiar to all ages and to all peoples,\nconfined to the eyebrow, the eyelid, and the merry little wrinkles in\nthe corner. When any spoke to him, however, and many did, for his face\nwas fresh and pleasing, he would reply in English that he spoke no\nFrench, regretfully.\n\n\"There's the chap with the scar. He is a handsome beggar,\" Hillard\nadmitted. \"I wonder what sort of blackleg he is? He's no ordinary one,\nI'm certain. I begin to recognize the face of the man with him. He's a\ndistinguished diplomat, and he would not associate with a man who was\nthoroughly bad, according to law, leaving out the moral side of it. Let\nus watch them.\"\n\nThe Italian played like an old hand; a number once in a while, but\nmaking it a point to stake on the colors. Red began to repeat itself. He\ndoubled and doubled. On the sixth consecutive turn he played the maximum\nof twelve thousand francs, and won. The diplomat touched him on the arm\nsignificantly, but the player shook his head. Ten minutes later he had\nwon forty thousand francs. Again he refused to leave his chair.\n\n\"If he stays now,\" said Hillard, \"he will lose it all. His friend is\nright.\"\n\n\"Forty thousand francs, eight thousand dollars!\" murmured Merrihew\nsadly. Why couldn't he have luck like this?\n\nHillard was a true prophet. There came a change in the smile of fortune.\nThe game jumped from color to color, seldom repeating, with zero making\nitself conspicuous. The man with the scar played on, but he began to\nlose, small sums at first, then larger, till finally he was down to his\noriginal stake. The scar grew livid. He waited five turns of the wheel,\nthen placed his stake on the second dozen. He lost. He rose from his\nchair, scowling. His eye chanced to meet Hillard's, and their glances\nheld for a moment.\n\n\"Fool!\" said Merrihew in an undertone, as the man strolled leisurely\npast them. \"Eight thousand, and not content to quit!\"\n\n\"My boy, a man who needs a hundred thousand and wins but eight is seldom\ncontent.\" Hillard followed the Italian with his eyes as he approached\none of the lounges. There the loser was joined by his friend, and the\ntwo of them fell to gesticulating wildly, after the manner of their\nrace. Hillard understood this pantomime; the diplomat had been a\nshare-holder. \"Start your play, Dan. I'll find plenty of amusement at\nthe other tables. My watching your game hasn't brought you any luck up\nto the present. Go in and give 'em a beating.\"\n\nMerrihew hastened over to the north table. This was, according to\nreport, the table which had no suicide's chair; and Merrihew had his\nprivate superstitions like the rest of us. At eleven o'clock the banks\nclosed, so he had but two hours in which to win a fortune. It was not\npossible for him to lose one; in this the gods were with him.\n\nMeanwhile the trolleys from Nice and Mentone had poured into Monte Carlo\ntheir usual burdens of pleasure seekers. On one of the cars from Nice\nthere had arrived two women, both veiled and simply gowned. The\nconductor had seen them before, but never at night. They seldom\naddressed each other, and never spoke to any one else. He picked them up\nat Villefranche. Doubtless they were some sober married women out for a\nlark. Upon leaving the car they did not at once go into the Casino, but\ndirected their steps toward the terraces, for the band was playing. They\nsat in the shadow of the statue of Massenet, and near-by the rasp of a\ncricket broke in upon the music. When the music stopped they linked arms\nand sauntered up and down the wide sweep of stone, mutually interested\nin the crowds, the color, and the lights. Once, as they passed behind a\nbench, the better to view the palaces of the prince, they heard the\nvoices of two men.\n\n\"Ho-hum!\"\n\n\"Heigh-ho!\"\n\nAs they went on, the women heard something about cigars. The men were\nAmericans, evidently. It was only an inconsequent incident, and a moment\nlater both had forgotten it. By and by they proceeded to the Casino.\nRarely women wear veils at Monte Carlo. On the contrary, they go there\n(most of them) to be seen, admired and envied. Thus, these two were\nfully aware of the interest they excited. At frequent intervals\nroyalty--the feminine side of the family--steals into Monte Carlo, often\nunattended. When one's yacht is in the harbor below, it does not entail\nmuch danger. There is a superstition regarding veils; but no attendant\nrequested the women to remove them. They dared not, for fear of\naffronting royalty. It was a delicate situation, so far as the\nattendants were concerned.\n\n\"At which table shall I make the stake, Kitty?\"\n\n\"The center; there is always a crush there, and we shall not be\nnoticed.\"\n\n\"I do not agree with you there. However, it shall be the center table.\nWhat would you do, Kitty, if I should break the bank?\"\n\n\"Die of excitement!\" truthfully.\n\n\"You will live through this event, then.\" With a light careless laugh,\nLa Signorina pressed her way to the table.\n\nThe play here was in full swing, and in some cases very high. She opened\nher purse and took out a handful of gold. These napoleons were all that\nremained of the capital intrusted her. She hesitated for some time, then\nplaced a coin on the number twenty-five, her age. The ivory ball spun\nround and round, till it lost some of its force and slanted, struck one\nof the little silver obstacles, and bounded into one of the\ncompartments. It was the number twenty-five: thirty-five napoleons for\none, a hundred and forty dollars! Kitty uttered an ejaculation of\ndelight. Many looked enviously at the winner as the neat little stack of\ngold was pushed toward her. She took the gold and placed it on black.\nAgain she won. Then fortune packed up and went elsewhere. She lost\nsteadily, winning but one bet in every ten. She gave no sign, however,\nthat her forces were in full retreat from the enemy. She played on, and\nthe hand which placed the bets was steady. She was a thoroughbred. And\nwhen the gold was all gone, she opened her empty hands expressively and\nshrugged. She was beaten. Behind the chair of the banker, opposite,\nstood the Italian. The scowl still marred his forehead. When the woman\nin the veil spread out her hands, he started. There was something\nfamiliar to his mind in that gesture. And then the woman saw him. For\nthe briefest moment her form stiffened and the shape of her chin was\nmolded in the veil. Slight as this sign was, the Italian observed it.\nBut he was puzzled.\n\n\"Kitty,\" La Signorina whispered, \"let us go out to the atrium. I am\ntired.\"\n\nThey left the hall leisurely and found a vacant settle in the atrium.\n\n\"I have a horror of bats,\" said La Signorina.\n\n\"How cold your hands are!\" exclaimed Kitty. \"Never mind about the money.\nThey will understand.\"\n\n\"Kitty, I am a fool, a fool! I have unwittingly put my head in the\nlion's mouth. If I had not reached this seat in time, I should have\nfallen. I would willingly give all my rings if, at this moment, I could\nrun across the hall and out into the open!\"\n\n\"Merciful Heaven! Why, what is the matter? What has happened?\" Kitty was\nall in a flutter.\n\n\"I can not explain to you.\"\n\n\"Was it some one you saw in there?\"\n\n\"Silence; and sit perfectly still!\"\n\nThe swinging doors opened and closed. A man in evening dress came out\ninto the atrium, lighting a cigarette. At the sight of him both women\nwere startled. Their emotions, however, were varied and unlike.\n\n\"It is Mr. Hillard, Mr. Merrihew's friend!\" Kitty would have risen, but\nthe other's strong hand restrained her.\n\n\"Kitty, remember your promise.\"\n\n\"Is _he_ the man?\"\n\n\"No, no! Only, I have said that we must not meet him. It might do him\nincalculable harm. Harm!\" La Signorina repeated; \"do you understand?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Silence, I command you!\"\n\nThe tone had the power to subdue Kitty. The indignant protest died on\nher lips. She sat perfectly still, but she would have liked to cry. To\nlet Mr. Hillard pass by in this manner, without a sign of friendliness\nor recognition! It was intolerable. And he could tell where Merrihew was\n(as indeed he could!) and what he was doing. She choked and crushed the\nends of her veil.\n\nHillard blew outward a few pale rings of smoke and circled the atrium\nwith an indolent glance which stopped as it rested upon the two veiled\nwomen sitting alone. Besides being bored and wanting amusement, a\ncertain curiosity impelled him toward them, and he sank on the settle\nbeside them, with perhaps half a dozen spans of the hand between. He\nsmoked till the cigarette scorched his fingers, then he dropped it,\nextinguishing the coal with the toe of his pump. He observed the women\nfrankly. Not a single wisp of hair escaped the veils, not a line of any\nfeature could be traced, and yet the tint of flesh shone dimly behind\nthe silken bands of crape; and the eyes sparkled. He nodded.\n\n\"A wonderful scene in there,\" indicating the swinging doors. \"Puck was\nright. What fools these mortals be! Something for nothing will always\nlure us.\"\n\nThe veils did not move so much as the breadth of a hair.\n\n\"Fortune favors the brave, but rarely the foolish.\"\n\nThere was no response, but the small shoe of the woman nearest began to\nbeat the floor ever so lightly. Hillard was chagrined. To be rebuffed\nthe very first time he spoke to a woman in the Casino!\n\n\"Perhaps madame does not understand?\" he said in French.\n\nOne of the women stirred restlessly; that was all.\n\nHe repeated the question in Italian, at the same time feeling like a\npedant airing his accomplishments.\n\nNothing.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, getting upon his feet. \"I see that you do\nnot wish to talk.\"\n\nThereupon he bowed, sought another seat, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\nBut not for a moment did his eye leave these two mysterious women. Their\nabsolute silence confused him. Usually a woman gives some sign of\ndisapproval when addressed by a stranger. These two sat as if they\nneither saw nor heard him. He shook the ash from his cigarette, and when\nhe looked up again, the women were hurrying across the floor to the\nlobby. He would have given them no further thought had not the Italian\nwith the scar appeared upon the scene, eyed the retreating figures\ndoubtfully, and then started after them. That he did not know them\nHillard was reasonably certain. He assumed that the Italian saw a\npossible flirtation. He rose quickly and followed. If these two women\ndesired to be left alone, he might be of assistance.\n\nThe four departed from the Casino and crossed toward the Hotel de Paris,\nthe women in the lead. As yet they had not observed that they were being\nfollowed. The car stops at this turn. As the women came to a stand, one\nof them saw the approaching men. Instantly she fled up the street, swift\nas a hare. The other hesitated for a second, then pursued her companion\nfrantically. Whatever doubts the Italian might have entertained, this\nunexpected flight dissipated them. He knew now; he knew, he knew! With a\nsharp cry of exultation he broke into a run. So did Hillard. He was no\nlonger bored. This promised to be interesting. People turned and stared,\nbut none sought to intercept any of the runners. In Monte Carlo there\nare many strange scenes, and the knight-errant often finds that his bump\nof caution has suddenly developed. In other words, it is none of his\naffair. To look was one thing, to follow, to precipitate one's head into\nthe unknown, was another. And there were no police about; they were on\nthe Casino terraces, or strolling through the gardens, or patrolling the\nrailway station.\n\nPast the park the quartet ran, and took the first turn to the left for a\nblock or more. Then came a stretch of darkness, between one electric\nlamp and another. And then, as if whisked away by magic, the foremost\nwoman disappeared. The other halted, breathless and wondering. She\nstarted again, but a moment too late. The Italian caught her roughly by\nthe arm and with a quick movement tore aside the veil.\n\n\"Kitty Killigrew!\" Hillard cried.\n\nHe sprang forward, grasped the Italian by the shoulders and whirled him\nround in no gentle manner. The Italian struck out savagely and\nfearlessly, but Hillard seized his arm and held it firmly. There was a\nshort tableau. Each man could hear the breathing of the other, quick and\ndeep. The devil gleamed in the Italian's eyes, but there was a menace\nHillard's equally strong.\n\n\"You meddling figure of a dog!\"\n\n\"Take care lest the dog bite, signore.\"\n\n\"Release my arm and stand aside!\"\n\n\"Presently. Now, that way is yours,\" said Hillard, pointing in the\ndirection of the way they had come.\n\n\"Are you certain?\" The Italian regulated his breathing, forcing down the\nbeat of his heart.\n\n\"So certain that if you do not obey me, I shall call the police and let\nyou explain to them.\"\n\n\"I should like nothing better,\" replied the Italian, with a coolness\nwhich dumfounded Hillard.\n\n\"Do you know these ladies?\"\n\n\"Do you?\" insolently.\n\n\"My knowing them does not matter. But it is any gentleman's concern when\na man gives pursuit to a lady who does not wish to meet him, even in\nMonte Carlo.\"\n\n\"A lady? Grace of Mary, that is droll!\"\n\nHillard released the imprisoned arm, consciously chilled by the tone.\nThere was a patent raillery, a quizzical insolence, which convinced\nHillard that the Italian had not given chase out of an idle purpose.\nWhile this idea was forming in his mind, the Italian inspected his cuff,\nbrushed his sleeve, and then recalled that he was bareheaded. He laughed\nshortly.\n\n\"We shall meet again,\" he said softly.\n\n\"I hope not,\" replied Hillard frankly, at the same time placing himself\nso as to block any sudden attempt to take up the chase. \"However, you\nmay find me at the Hotel de Londres.\"\n\nThe Italian laughed again. \"You understand the language well,\"\ndebatingly.\n\n\"And the people, too.\" Hillard had no desire to pass the time of day\nwith his opponent.\n\n\"Well, I have said that we shall meet again, and it must be so.\"\n\n\"And your hat, as well as mine, is still in the Casino. The night is\ncold.\"\n\nThe Italian tugged impatiently at his mustache and permitted his glance\nto wander over Hillard critically. No, a struggle, much as he longed for\nit, would not be wise. He swung round on his heel and walked rapidly\ndown the street, much to Hillard's relief. Presently the Italian took\nthe corner, and Hillard turned to reassure Kitty.\n\nBut Kitty had vanished!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nMANY NAPOLEONS\n\n\nHaving yawned luxuriously, Merrihew sighed with perfect content. The\npretty woman sitting opposite smiled at him tenderly, and he smiled\nback, abstractedly, as a man sometimes will when his mind tries to\ngather in comprehensively a thought and a picture which are totally\ndifferent. Before him, in neat little lustrous stacks, stood seven\nthousand francs in gold, three hundred and fifty effigies of Napoleon\nthe Little. And this was the thought which divided the smile with the\npicture. Seven thousand francs, fourteen hundred dollars, more than half\nthe sum of his letter of credit! And all this prodigious fortune for a\nlittle gold put here, and a little gold put there, wisely,\nscientifically; for he would have strenuously denied that it was due to\nbald, blind luck. If only the boys at the club could see him now! He wet\nhis lips suggestively, but the lust for gold was stronger than the call\nof tobacco. Tobacco could wait; fortune might not. Still, he took out a\ncigar, bit off the end, and put it back in his pocket. And where the\ndeuce had Hillard gone? Twenty minutes to eleven, and no sign of him\nsince the play began.\n\nHe counted off ten coins and placed them on the second dozen. The ball\nrolled into number twenty-three. He leaned back again with a second\nsigh, and the pretty woman smiled a second smile, and the wooden rake\npushed the beautiful gold over to him. He was playing a system, one bet\nin every three turns of the wheel, in stakes of forty and eighty\ndollars. To be sure he lost now and then, but the next play he doubled\nand retrieved. Oh, the American Comic Opera Company should be well taken\ncare of. He could play the good Samaritan after the manner of a prince,\nif, indeed, princes ever elected to play that role. Two more bets, and\nthen he would pocket his winnings and go. He laid forty francs on number\ntwenty-six and four hundred on black, leaned upon his elbows and studied\nthe pretty woman, who smiled. If she spoke English.... He scribbled the\nquestion on a scrap of paper and pushed it across the table, blushing a\nlittle as he did so. She read it, or at least she tried to read it, and\nshook her head with the air of one deeply puzzled. He sighed again,\nreflecting that there might have been a pleasant adventure had he only\nunderstood French. Hang the legend of the Tower of Babel! it was always\nconfronting him in this part of the world.\n\nTwenty-six, black and even!\n\nMerrihew slid back his chair and rose. He swept up the gold by the\nhandful and poured it into his pockets, casually and unconcernedly, as\nif this was an every-day affair and of minor importance. But as a matter\nof fact, his heart was beating fast, and there was a wild desire in his\nthroat to yell with delight. Eighteen hundred dollars, nine thousand\nfrancs! A merry music they made in his pockets. Jingle, jingle, jingle!\nNot only the good Samaritan, but the accursed thousand, that baneful\nthousand, that Nemesis of every New Year, might now be overtaken and\nannihilated. O happy thought! His pockets sagged, he could walk but\nstiffly, and in weight he seemed to have gained a ton. And then he saw\nHillard coming across the hall. Instantly he forced the joy from his\nface and eyes and dropped his chin in his collar. He became in that\nmoment the picture of desolation.\n\n\"Is it all over?\" asked Hillard gravely.\n\n\"All over!\" monotonously.\n\n\"Come over to the caf\u00c3\u00a9, then. I've something important to tell you.\"\n\n\"Found them?\" with rousing interest.\n\n\"I shall tell you only when we get out of this place. Come.\"\n\nMerrihew followed him into the cloak-room; and as they came out into the\nnight, Hillard put out a friendly hand.\n\n\"I am sorry, boy; I wanted you to win something. Cheer up; we'll shake\nthe dust of this place in the morning.\"\n\nMerrihew took off his hat and tossed it into the air hilariously. As it\ncame down he tried to catch it on the toe of his pump, but active as he\nwas he missed, and it rolled along the pavement. He recovered it\nquickly.\n\n\"Oh, for a vacant lot and a good old whooper-up! Feel!\" he said,\ntouching his side pockets. Hillard felt. \"Feel again!\" commanded\nMerrihew, touching his trousers pockets. Hillard, with increasing\nwonder, felt again.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"What is it? It is four hundred and fifty napoleons!\"\n\n\"What?\" sharply, even doubtfully.\n\n\"That's what! Eighteen hundred dollars, more than three hundred and\nsixty pounds, nearly a million centesimi, and Heaven only knows what it\nwould be in Portuguese. My system will have no funeral to-night. Pretty\nfair returns for two hours' work, by George! Now, come on.\"\n\nHe caught Hillard by the sleeve and fairly ran him over to the caf\u00c3\u00a9.\nHere he pushed him into a chair and ordered the finest vintage he could\nfind on the card. Then he offered one of the fatal cigars and lighted\none for himself.\n\n\"Nearly two thousand!\" murmured Hillard. \"Well, of all the luck!\"\n\n\"It does seem too good to be true. And what's more, I'm going to hang on\nto it. No more for me; I'm through. For the first time in my life I've\nwon something, and I am going to keep it.... I say, what's the matter\nwith your cravat?\"\n\nHillard looked down at the fluttering end and reknotted it carelessly.\n\n\"I saw Kitty to-night,\" he said.\n\nTo Merrihew it seemed that all the clatter about him had died away\nsuddenly. He lowered his cigar and breathed deeply. \"Where is she?\" He\nrose. \"Sit down. I don't know where she is. I'll explain what has\nhappened. And this is it.\"\n\nMerrihew listened eagerly, twisting his cigar from one corner of his\nmouth to the other. Once he made a gesture; it was reproachful.\n\n\"And why did you bother about him? Why didn't you hold on to Kitty?\"\n\n\"I confess it was stupid of me. But the gentleman with the scar was an\nunknown quantity. Besides, why should Kitty, in an episode like this,\nrun away from me, of all persons? That's what is troubling me. And why,\nwhen I spoke to them in the Casino, did they ignore me completely?\"\n\n\"It's your confounded prima donna; she's at the bottom of all this, take\nmy word for it. Something's desperately wrong. Persons do not wear masks\nand hide in this manner just for a lark. And we have lost them again!\nWhy didn't you knock him down?\" hotly.\n\n\"I wanted to, but it wasn't the psychological moment. He recovered\nhimself too quickly. You can't knock a man down when he practically\nsurrenders.\"\n\n\"You're too particular. But what's the matter with Kitty? I don't\nunderstand. To see you was to know that I was round somewhere. She ran\naway from me as well as from you. What shall we do?\"\n\n\"Start the hunt again, or give it up entirely. There are some villages\nbetween here and Nice. It must be in that direction; they were about to\nboard the car for Nice. If you hadn't been gambling, if you had been\nsensible and stayed with me--\"\n\n\"Come, now, that won't wash. You know very well that you urged me to\nplay.\"\n\n\"You would have played without any urging.\"\n\nThe wine came, but the joy of drinking it was gone; and they emptied the\nbottle perfunctorily. To Merrihew everything was out of tune now. Why,\nKitty Killigrew was worth all the napoleons in or out of France. And\nKitty had run away! What was the meaning of it?\n\n\"And who is this Italian, anyhow? And why did he run after your prima\ndonna?\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I wish to find out,\" answered Hillard. \"The lady\nwhom you call my prima donna knew him and he knew her, and she must have\nhad mighty good reasons for running.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that Kitty has fallen among a bad lot. I'll wager it is some\nanarchist business. They are always plotting the assassination of kings\nover here, and this mysterious woman is just the sort to rope in a\nconfiding girl like Kitty. One thing, if I come across our friend with\nthe scar--\"\n\n\"You will wisely cross to the opposite side of the street. To find out\nwhat this tangle is, it is not necessary to jump head first into it.\"\n\n\"A bad lot.\"\n\n\"That may be, but no anarchists, my boy.\"\n\nHillard was a bit sore at heart. That phrase recurred and recurred: \"A\nlady? Grace of Mary, that is droll!\" As he turned it over it had a\nbitter taste. The shadow of disillusion crept into his bright dream and\nclouded it. To build so beautiful a castle, and to see it tumble at a\nword! The Italian had spoken with a contempt which was based on\nsomething more tangible than suspicion. What was she to him, or, rather,\nwhat had she been? If she was innocent of any wrong, why all this\nmystery? Persecution? That did not necessitate masks and veils and\nsudden flights. Well, he was a man: even as he watched this cloud of\nsmoke, he would watch the dream rise and vanish into the night.\n\nMerrihew solemnly spun his wine-glass, but made no effort to refill it.\n\n\"I'm thinking hard,\" he said, \"but I can't make out Kitty.\"\n\n\"No more can I. But if she ran away from me, she had a definite purpose,\nand some day we'll find out just what it was. I am more than half\ninclined to give up the chase entirely. You will see Kitty in New York\nagain, and the whys and wherefores will be illumined. But if I keep on\nthinking of this masquerading lady, I shall get into a mental trouble\nwhich will not be at all agreeable. I would to Heaven that she had sung\nunder any window but mine.\"\n\n\"All right. Kitty doesn't wish to meet us. So we'll light out for Venice\nin the morning. I'm not going to be made a fool of for the best woman\nalive.\"\n\n\"There is still the Campo Formosa. If they return to Venice, and\ndoubtless they will, for I believe they came here to replenish their\npurses, we'll hunt up the Campo and make inquiries. It is not anarchism.\nAnarchists always need money, and they wouldn't let me slip through\ntheir fingers, once having taken hold of my curiosity in this way. You\nmay be sure it is something deeper than that. Anarchism wouldn't\ninterest a sensible little woman like Kitty.\"\n\n\"You never can tell what will interest a woman,\" said Merrihew owlishly.\n\n\"There's truth in that. But Kitty isn't romantic; she has her bump of\ncaution.\"\n\n\"I agree to that. She refused me.\"\n\nThey both laughed quietly.\n\n\"Well, if nothing happens in Venice, we'll go to Verona, buy a pair of\ngood saddle-horses, and take the road to Florence. That will be\nsomething worth while. And it will clear this romantic fog out of our\nheads.\"\n\n\"That's the most sensible thing you've said in a long time,\" said\nMerrihew, brightening considerably. \"A leg up and a couple of hundred\nmiles of these great roads! You've hit it squarely, by George! And out\nof my winnings we can buy ripping hunters. The American Comic Opera\nCompany be hanged! But I'd give half of my winnings if I knew what was\nat the bottom of it all. Seems as if fate were moving us round for a\npastime. We have probably passed and repassed the two women a dozen\ntimes.\"\n\n\"And but for those cigars--\"\n\n\"Will you kindly forget that?\"\n\n\"If you insist upon it.\"\n\n\"Thanks. We came over to see Italy; let's see it. Now, I'm for turning\nin. A bit headachey; infernally hot in the roulette room.\"\n\nIn truth, all the enthusiasm was gone from Merrihew's heart. Since Kitty\nevinced a desire to avoid him, the world grew charmless; and the fortune\nof Midas, cast at his feet, would not have warmed him. On the way over\nto the hotel, however, he whistled bravely and jingled the golden\nlargess in his pockets. He bade good night to Hillard and sought his\nroom. Here he emptied his pockets on the table and built a shelving\nhouse of gold. He sat down and began to count. Clink-clink! Clink-clink!\nWhat a pleasant sound it was, to be sure. It was sweeter than woman's\nlaughter. And what symphony of Beethoven's could compare with this?\nClink-clink! Three hundred and ninety, four hundred, four hundred and\nten; clink-clink! And Hillard, turning restlessly on his pillow, heard\nthis harsh music away into the small hours of the morning.\n\nIn the meantime the lamps in and about the Casino had been extinguished,\nand the marble house of the whirligig and the terraces lay in the pale\nlight of the moon. Only the caf\u00c3\u00a9s remained open, and none but stragglers\nloitered there. The great rush of the night was done with, and the\ncurious had gone away, richer or poorer, but never a whit the wiser. In\nthe harbor the yachts stood out white and spectral, and afar the sea\nruffled her night-caps. The tram for Nice shrieked down the incline\ntoward the promontory, now a vast frowning shadow. At the foot of the\nroad which winds up to the palaces the car was signaled, and two women\nboarded. Both were veiled and exhibited signs of recent agitation. They\nmaintained a singular silence. At Villefranche they got out, and the car\nwent on glowingly through the night. The women stopped before the gates\nof a villa and rang the porter's bell. Presently he came down the path\nand admitted them, grumbling. Once in the room above, the silence\nbetween the two women came to an end.\n\n\"Safe! I am so tired. What a night!\" the elder of the two women sighed.\n\n\"What a night, truly! I should like to know what it has all been about.\nTo run through dark streets and alleys, to hide for hours, as if I were\na thief or a fugitive from justice, is neither to my taste nor to my\nliking.\"\n\n\"Kitty!\" brokenly.\n\n\"I know! In a moment I shall be on my knees to you, but first I must\nspeak out my mind. Why did you lose your head? Why did you not stand\nperfectly still when you saw that we were followed from the Casino? He\nwould not have dared to molest us in the open. No, you had to run!\"\n\n\"He would have entered the car with us, he would have known where we\nwere going, he would have had the patience to wait till he saw beneath\nour veils. I know that man!\" with a hopeless anger.\n\n\"It was your flight. It told him plainly that you recognized him.\"\n\n\"I was afraid, Kitty. It was instinct which caused me to fly, blindly.\"\n\n\"And there you left me, standing like a fool, wondering whether to run\nor not.\" Kitty was angry for half a dozen reasons. \"And why should you\nrun from any man?\"\n\nLa Signorina did not reply, preferring to hold her tongue, lest it\noverthrow her. She unwound the thick veil and unpinned her hat. Her\nhands trembled, and in her eyes and about her mouth there was the\nweariness of ages. Yet, not all this weariness, not all these transitory\nlines of pain, took away one jot of her beauty.\n\n\"Kitty,\" she began sadly, \"in this world no one trusts us wholly. We\nmust know why, why; loyalty must have reasons, chivalry must have facts.\nYou have vowed your love and loyalty a hundred times, and still, when a\ngreat crisis confronts me, you question, you grow angry, you complain,\nbecause my reasons are unknown to you. Because I am lonely, because I\nfeel the need of even your half-hearted loyalty, I shall tell you why,\nwhy. Do you know what terror is? No. Well, it was blind terror which\nmade me run. I counted not the consequences; my one thought was of\ninstant flight. I shall tell you why I am lonely, why the world, bright\nto you, is dark. I am proud, but I shall bend my pride.\" With a quick\nmovement she lifted her head high and her eyes burned into Kitty's very\nheart. \"I am--\"\n\n\"Stop! No, no! I forbid you!\" Kitty put her hands over her ears. She\nmight gain the secret, but she knew that she would lose the heart of the\nwoman it concerned. \"I am wrong, wrong. I have promised to follow you\nloyally, without question. I will keep that promise. I am only angry\nbecause you would not let me speak to Mr. Hillard. And when he called me\nby name, it was doubly hard. Had I not seen your hand waving from the\ndoorway, I should have spoken. Who this Italian is I do not care. It is\nsufficient that you fear him. And I myself harbor no kind feelings\ntoward him,\" rubbing her bruised wrist. \"And if he comes down one side\nof the street I shall take to the other, to say nothing of dodging round\nthe nearest corner. But he is very handsome,\" Kitty added thoughtfully.\n\n\"Are vipers handsome?\"\n\n\"He is strong, too.\"\n\n\"Strong and cruel as a tiger. How I hate him! But thank you, Kitty,\nthank you. Sooner or later, if we stay together, I must tell you. The\nconfidence will do me good. Look into my eyes.\" Kitty approached, and La\nSignorina drew her close. \"Look in them. They will tell you that I have\nneither conspired nor plotted, save for my own happiness; that I have\nwrought harm to no one. But on my side they will tell you that I have\nbeen terribly wronged. And all I wish is to be left alone, alone. It was\ncruel of me to forbid you to speak to Mr. Hillard. But I do not want him\ntangled up in this miserable, hopeless labyrinth. I wish him to\nrecollect me pleasantly, as a whimsical being who came into his life one\nnight and vanished out of it in two hours.\"\n\n\"But supposing the memory cuts deeply?\" ventured Kitty. \"Men fall in\nlove with less excuse than this.\"\n\n\"He does not even know what I look like; he knows absolutely nothing\nexcept the sound of my voice.\"\n\n\"It is all a blind man needs--a voice.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" La Signorina opened the window to air the room. She\nlingered, musing. \"You are very good to me, Kitty.\"\n\n\"I can't help being good to you, you strange, lovely woman! For your\nsake as well as for mine, I hope my letter from home will be in Venice\nwhen we arrive. Now I am going to write a letter.\"\n\nLa Signorina still lingered by the window.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMerrihew was pocketing currency in exchange for his gold, when Hillard\npassed an opened letter to him. It was early in the morning; the sky was\nas yellow as brass; patches of dew still dampened the sidewalks, and the\nair was still with the promise of heat in the later day. Merrihew\nstuffed the last bill into his wallet and gave his attention to the\nletter. He was not long indifferent, for the letter was from no less a\nperson than Kitty. It was, however, addressed to Hillard.\n\n     My dear Mr. Hillard--Do not seek us. It will be useless. This\n     sounds terribly ungrateful, but it must be so. If Mr. Merrihew is\n     with you, and I suspect he is, tell him that some day I will\n     explain away the mystery. At present I know no more than you do.\n     But this please make plain to him: If he insists upon searching for\n     me, he will only double my unhappiness.\n\n     Kitty Killigrew.\n\nMerrihew soberly tucked the letter away. \"I knew it,\" he said simply.\n\"She is in some trouble or other, some tangle, and fears to drag us into\nit. Who left a letter here this morning?\" he asked of the concierge.\n\n\"A small boy from Villefranche.\"\n\n\"Just my luck,\" said Merrihew, his hands speaking eloquently. \"I said\nthat it would be of no use to hunt in the smaller towns. Well, we had\nbetter take the luggage back to the rooms.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Hillard.\n\n\"I am going to Villefranche.\"\n\n\"You will be wasting time. After what happened last night, I am certain\nthat they will be gone. Let us not change our plans, and let us respect\ntheirs, hard as it may seem to you.\"\n\n\"But you?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't bother about me. I have relegated my little romance to the\ngarret of no-account things, at least for the present,\" said Hillard,\nwith an enigmatical smile. He sought his watch. \"Make up your mind at\nonce; we have only twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Oh, divine afflatus! And you lay down the chase so readily as this?\"\nMerrihew was scornfully indignant.\n\n\"I would travel the breadth of the continent were I sure of meeting this\nwoman. But she has become a will-o'-the-wisp, and I am too old and like\ncomfort too well to pursue impossibilities.\"\n\n\"But why did she leave you that mask?\" demanded Merrihew. \"She must have\nmeant something by that.\"\n\n\"True, but for the life of me I can't figure out what, unless she wished\nto leave with me the last page of the adventure.\"\n\n\"But I don't like the idea of leaving Kitty this way, without a final\neffort to rescue her from the clutches of this fascinating adventuress.\nFor you must admit that she is naught else.\"\n\n\"I admit nothing, my boy, save that the keenness of the chase is gone.\"\nHillard balanced his watch idly. \"As for Kitty, she's a worldly little\nwoman, and can take good care of herself. She is not likely to blunder\ninto any serious conspiracy. Her letter should be sufficient.\"\n\n\"But it isn't. A woman's 'don't' often means 'do.' If Kitty really\nexpects me to search for her and I do not, she will never believe in me\nagain.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your knowledge of women is more extensive than mine,\" said\nHillard, without the least irony.\n\nBut this flattery did not appeal to Merrihew. \"Bosh! There's something\nyou haven't told me about that makes you so indifferent.\"\n\nThis was a shrewd guess, but Hillard had his reasons for not letting his\nfriend see how close he had shot. \"A lady? Grace of Mary, that is\ndroll!\" He could not cast this out of his thought. He floated between\nthis phrase and Mrs. Sandford's frank defense of her girlhood friend.\nPerhaps he was lacking in some particle of chivalry; perhaps he was not\nin love at all. And of what use to offer faith to one who refused it?\n\n\"Time flies,\" he warned. \"Which is it to be?\"\n\n\"We'll go on to Venice. It would be folly for me to continue the hunt\nalone. And if you went with me, your half-heartedness would be a damper.\nWe'll go on to Venice.\"\n\n\"Have you any cigars left?\" smiling.\n\n\"I have thrown away the boxes and filled my pockets.\"\n\n\"That's better. But the Italians are not so severe as the French. We\nshan't have any trouble recrossing into Italy. All aboard, then.\"\n\nMerrihew solemnly directed the porter to paste the scarlet labels on his\ncases. He was beginning to take a certain blas\u00c3\u00a9 pride in his luggage.\nAlready it had the appearance of having traveled widely. It would look\nwell on week-end trips at home.\n\nAt seven that evening they stepped out of the station in Venice. The\nblue twilight of Venice, that curves down from the hollow heavens,\nsoftening a bit of ugliness here, accentuating a bit of loveliness\nthere; that mysterious, incomparable blue which is without match or\nequivalent, and which flattens all perspective and gives to each scene\nthe look of a separate canvas! Here Merrihew found one of his dreams\ncome true, and his first vision of the Grand Canal, with its gondolas\nand barges and queer little bobtailed skiffs, was never to leave him.\nWhat impressed him most was the sense of peace and quiet. No one seemed\nin a hurry, for hurry carries with it the suggestion of noise and\nturmoil. Hillard hunted for his old gondolier, but could not find him.\nSo he chose one Achille whose ferrule was bright and who carried the\nnumber 154. With their trunks, which they had picked up at Genoa, and\nsmall luggage in the hotel barge, they had the gondola all to\nthemselves.\n\nInstead of following the Grand Canal, Achille took the short cut through\nthe Ruga di San Giovanni and the Rio di San Polo. It was early\nmoonlight, and as they glided silently past the ancient marble church in\nthe Campo San Polo the fairy-like beauty of it caught Merrihew by the\nthroat.\n\n\"This is the happy hunting grounds,\" he said. \"This beats all the\ncab-riding I ever heard of. And this is Venice!\" He patted Hillard on\nthe shoulder. \"I am grateful to you, Jack. If you hadn't positively\ndragged me into it, I should have gone on grubbing, gone on thinking\nthat I knew something about beauty. Venice!\" He extended his arms as a\nMuezzin does when he calls to prayer. \"Venice! The shade of Napoleon, of\nOthello, of Portia, of Petrarch!\"\n\nHillard smiled indulgently. \"I love your enthusiasm, Dan. So long as a\nman has that, the rest doesn't matter.\"\n\nOut into the Grand Canal again, and another short cut by the way of the\nRio del Baccaroli. As they swept under the last bridge before coming out\ninto the hotel district, Hillard espied a beggar leaning over the\nparapet. The faint light of the moon shone full in his face.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Hillard to Achille, who swung down powerfully on his\nblade. Hillard stood up excitedly.\n\nThe beggar took to his heels, and when Hillard stepped out of the\ngondola and gained the bridge, the beggar had disappeared.\n\n\"Who was it?\" asked Merrihew indifferently.\n\n\"Giovanni!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nO'MALLY SUGGESTS\n\n\nIn a bedroom in one of the cheap little _pensiones_ which shoulder one\nanother along the Riva degli Schiavoni, from the ducal palace to the\npublic gardens, sat three men. All three were smoking execrable tobacco\nin ancient pipes. Now and then this one or that consulted his watch\n(grateful that he still possessed it), as if expecting some visitor. The\ncastaways of the American Comic Opera troupe were on the anxious seat\nthis morning.\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"Think? Why, she'll be here this morning, or I know nothing about women.\nThat ring was worth a cool thousand.\" O'Mally shook the nicotine from\nhis pipe. \"She'll be here, never you worry. But,\" with a comic grimace,\n\"it's dollars to doughnuts that both of 'em will be stone-broke. I know\nsomething about that innocent little game called roulette.\"\n\n\"But if she's broke, what the devil shall we do?\" Smith put this\nquestion in no calm frame of mind.\n\n\"Forty dollars; it's a heap just now.\"\n\n\"She said she had another plan,\" said Worth.\n\n\"If it's a plan which needs no investments, all well and good. But, on\nmy word, I wouldn't dare advance another cent.\" Smith's brow wore many\nwrinkles.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said O'Mally.\n\n\"Positively, no,\" added Worth.\n\nO'Mally mused. \"A bill from your tailor will reach you here in eight\ndays, but money! Looks as if they had sent it via Japan.\"\n\n\"The one thing I'm sore about is the way she buncoed us into giving up\nour return tickets to the chorus.\"\n\n\"Shame on you!\" cried the generous O'Mally. \"What chance had any of them\non this side? Ten to one, nobody home could have sent them money. We men\ncan get along somehow. But I wish I could get some good plug-cut. This\nEnglish shoe-string tobacco burns like hot lead.\"\n\n\"O'Mally, what's your opinion?\"\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"La Signorina,\" said Worth.\n\n\"What about her?\"\n\n\"What do you think of her? She's not one of us; she belongs to another\nclass, and the stage is only an incident.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know what to think. I've pumped Killigrew, but she seems\nto be in the dark with the rest of us. That ring and the careless way\nshe offered it as security convinces me that she doesn't belong. But\nwhat a voice! It lifts you out of your very boots.\"\n\n\"Even when she talks,\" said Smith. \"Honestly, I'm glad she always wears\nthat veil. I might make a jackass of myself.\"\n\n\"It would be excusable,\" rejoined Worth, pressing the coal in his pipe\nand blowing the strong, biting smoke above his head. \"She is, without\nexception, one of the most beautiful women I ever saw or care to see.\"\nHe rose and walked over to the window and gazed down upon the quay,\nbright with morning sunshine and colorful with two human currents.\n\nSmith and O'Mally exchanged a swift, comprehensive look. There was one\nthing upon which they agreed fully, but they had not yet put it into\nwords. When Worth returned to his chair his two companions were\ninspecting the faded designs in the carpet.\n\n\"In Rome there was a grand duke,\" Worth remarked.\n\n\"And how she played him!\" laughed Smith.\n\n\"And there you are! Imagine an American comic opera star refusing to\ndine with a real duke! If anything convinces me, it is that. Think of\nthe advertisement it would have been in New York! Think of the fat part\nfor the press agent! No,\" continued O'Mally, \"she doesn't belong.\"\n\n\"The thing that sticks in my mind is the alternative which she has\npromised to offer.\" Worth eyed the ceiling. \"She said that if she failed\nat Monte Carlo she had another plan. What? Pawning her jewels? I think\nnot. But whatever it is, I expect to be counted in.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" agreed Smith.\n\nO'Mally took the small brilliant from his necktie and contemplated it\nsadly. \"The outsiders make fun of us for toting round these sparklers;\nbut often it's board and car-fare home. I paid seventy-five for this; I\nmight be able to raise thirty on it. Of course, she's backed us finely\nwith the hotel man; but if she shouldn't return, it's strapped the three\nof us will be. And no letters at Cook's this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, if worst comes to worst, the American consul will forward us to New\nYork. I'm not going to borrow any trouble.\" And Worth in his turn found\nemployment in the carpet patterns. Presently he got up briskly. \"I'm\ngoing down to the office.\"\n\n\"Bureau,\" corrected O'Mally.\n\n\"Bureau. There might be a note or something.\" Worth smiled.\n\nWhen he was out of the way O'Mally nodded wisely to his friend Smith.\n\n\"I hope he won't make a fool of himself over her.\"\n\n\"He has the symptoms. I've seen 'em before,\" replied Smith jocularly.\n\"But he's an odd duffer, and there's no knowing what he'll do before the\nround-up. It's a fine go, anyhow. Here we are, handsomely stranded\nthousands of miles from home. The only chance I have of finding money in\na letter is to sign for next season and draw down enough to pay for a\nsteamer ticket. As for a bank account, Lord! I never had one. I have\nmade two offers for my versatile talents, but no line yet.\"\n\nO'Mally laughed. \"Same boat. I've written to my brother, who has always\nheld that I'm a good-for-nothing. And he may see in this predicament of\nmine a good chance to be rid of me permanently. But I believe Worth has\na bank account at home. He is close-mouthed about his affairs. He\nreceived some letters yesterday, but when I quizzed him he made out he\ndidn't hear me. I didn't crowd him. Hope he won't make a fool of himself\nover La Signorina. Sh! he's coming back.\"\n\nThe door opened and Worth beckoned. \"They are in the parlor, waiting. I\ndon't know what news they bring.\"\n\nThere was a brightness in his eyes that meant unmistakable things to his\ntwo companions. They laid aside their pipes, tidied up a bit, and went\ndown to the stuffy salon. The two women rose as the men entered. There\nwas good cheer and handshaking. O'Mally's heart sank, however, as he\ntouched the hand of La Signorina. There was no joy in the pressure,\nnothing but sympathy and subtle encouragement.\n\n\"Come,\" he said cheerfully, \"put us out of our misery. Confess that you\nare both broke, and that Monte Carlo is still on the map.\"\n\nAs a preamble La Signorina raised the inevitable veil to the rim of her\nhat. Worth sat down in the darkest corner whence he could without\ninconvenience feast his eyes upon her beauty. Her tale was short and\nlightly told, with an interpolation now and then by Kitty.\n\n\"I was very foolish,\" said the erstwhile prima donna. \"I might have\nknown that when one is unlucky one may become still more unlucky. The\nsuperlative of bad luck has been my portion. But I did so wish to win. I\nwanted to bring back enough gold to send you all to America.\"\n\n\"But what was to become of you?\" asked Worth from behind his fortress of\nshadow.\n\n\"I?\" She paused with indecision. The question was not expected. \"Oh,\nItaly is my home. I shall find a way somehow. Put me out of your\nthoughts entirely. But I am sorry to bring you this bitter\ndisappointment, for it must be bitter. You have all been so good and\npatient in your misfortune.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" said O'Mally. \"Sure, we're no worse off than we were\nbefore. And here we've had a whole week of hope and fine air-castles.\nI've seen 'em tumble down so often that I've a shell like a turtle's\nnow. Forget it.\"\n\n\"But there is one thing I wish to understand thoroughly,\" put in Worth\nslowly.\n\n\"And that?\" La Signorina was never sure of this man. He was deeper than\nthe others; he had more polish, more knowledge of the world at large; he\nwas a gentleman by birth. He was a puzzle, and at this period she was\nnot overfond of shifting puzzles into answers.\n\n\"You have guaranteed our credit at this hotel. By what means?\" Worth\nheld her eye with courage.\n\n\"My word,\" she answered, finding that she could not beat down his eye.\n\n\"I know something of these foreign hotel managers. Words are all right,\nbut they must be backed by concrete values.\" Worth's eye was still\nsteady and unwavering. \"If, as I believe, you have guaranteed our credit\nhere by means of jewels, we must know.\"\n\nShe appealed silently to O'Mally, but he shook his head determinedly.\n\n\"It's only right that we should know,\" he said, wondering why this thing\nhad never entered his thick skull before.\n\n\"Let us not indulge in fine sentiment. I have guaranteed your credit\nhere; how I have done so, ought not to matter much.\"\n\n\"But it does,\" countered Worth. \"If by more than word, we insist upon\nknowing.\" Worth spoke with feeling. \"Do not for a moment doubt my\nattitude. I understand and appreciate your great generosity. We are\nabsolutely nothing to you, and you are not responsible for our\nmisfortunes. But we men have some pride left. A man might do for us what\nyou have done and we should accept it without comment; but a woman, no.\nThat alters the case entirely.\"\n\n\"Is it from a sense--a misguided sense--of chivalry?\" she asked, her\nlips suggesting a smile.\n\n\"That's probably it,\" O'Mally answered.\n\nAnd Smith inclined his head in approval.\n\n\"You are evading us,\" went on Worth, not having moved from his stand.\n\n\"You insist, then?\" coldly.\n\n\"Positively insist. If you do not tell us, we shall be forced to pay our\nbill and take our chances elsewhere.\" Worth pressed the button in the\nwall. A servant appeared directly. \"The manager, at once.\"\n\nLa Signorina dropped her veil and sat stiffly in her chair. Kitty moved\nuneasily. Was the man crazy to cross La Signorina like this? The manager\nappeared. He bowed.\n\n\"Madame here,\" began Worth, indicating La Signorina, \"has guaranteed our\ncredit at your hotel.\"\n\n\"Yes. Is not everything satisfactory?\" asked the manager eagerly.\n\n\"By what means has she established our credit? And do you know her?\"\n\n\"I never saw madame before till she came here with you gentlemen. What\nis the trouble?\" His brow wrinkled worriedly.\n\n\"What security did madame advance?\"\n\n\"Security?\" The manager looked at La Signorina, but she rendered him not\nthe least assistance. \"I have given my word to madame not to tell.\"\n\n\"In that case we three gentlemen shall leave this afternoon. You will\nmake out our bill at once.\"\n\nThis time the manager appealed to the lady eloquently.\n\n\"You are three foolish men,\" spoke La Signorina impatiently. \"If the\nmanager wishes to tell you he may do so. I give him permission.\"\n\nThe careless way she assigned the third person to the manager more than\never convinced Worth that somewhere and at some time La Signorina had\ncommanded.\n\n\"The security I have, gentlemen, is quite sufficient,\" said the manager.\n\n\"Produce it,\" said Worth. He realized that he had angered La Signorina,\nand he now regretted his scruples, which in this instance had their\nfoundation on mere curiosity. He would not retreat now.\n\nThe manager brought forth a fat wallet and opened it. Out of this he\ntook a flat object wrapped in tissue-paper. Very tenderly he unfolded\nit. The treasure was a diamond pendant, worth at least a thousand\ndollars.\n\n\"I was to keep this, simply till madame chose to reclaim it. Nothing has\nbeen advanced against it.\" A new thought came into the manager's mind,\nand he turned slightly pale. \"If it is not madame's--?\"\n\n\"It is mine,\" said La Signorina. She was very angry, but her sense of\njustice admitted that Worth was perfectly right. \"Once more I ask you\nnot to make me miserable by forcing this trinket back upon me. Will you\ndo me the honor to wait till to-morrow morning?\"\n\nThe three men involved exchanged questioning looks.\n\n\"Till to-morrow morning, then,\" said Worth. \"That will be all,\" he\nadded, to the manager, who was willing enough to make his escape.\n\n\"You will forgive us, won't you?\" asked O'Mally. \"It could not be. We\nmen have some ideas in our heads that you can't knock out with a club.\nIt was fine of you. You've a heart as big as all outdoors. We'll keep\nthe thought behind the deed. Eh, boys? Do not be angry with us.\"\n\n\"I am only angry to have been found out,\" she answered, not\nungraciously. Then she laughed. \"You are the strangest people! One would\nthink, to hear you talk, that I was giving you all this, when I merely\nadvanced security till your remittances come. Well, well, we shall say\nno more about it. I have a plan to lay before you that is a vastly more\ninteresting matter. It will be something of an adventure to us all.\"\n\n\"Adventure?\" O'Mally ran his tongue across his lips like a thirsty man\ncoming unexpectedly upon a pool of spring-water.\n\n\"Adventure? Let us be gone upon it at once,\" said Worth, anxious to\nreturn into the graces of this singular woman.\n\n\"Any place, so long as there's board and keep in it,\" Smith declared.\n\nKitty tried to read La Signorina's eyes. What madness this time?\n\nLa Signorina again raised her veil. From her girdle-bag she took a\nletter, which she unfolded across her knees. \"As I have said, I have\nfriends in Italy, and some of them are rich and powerful. This letter is\nfrom a friend I have always known. Has any one of you ever heard of the\nPrincipessa di Monte Bianca?\"\n\nA thoughtful frown passed from one face to another; and each strove to\nrecall this name among half-forgotten memories. Finally, one by one they\nshook their heads. The name had a familiar echo, but that was all. It\nwas quite possible that they had seen it in the Paris edition of the\n_Herald_.\n\n\"Let me read this letter to you. She addresses me as Capricciosa, my\nstage name.\"\n\nHer audience leaned forward attentively.\n\n     My Dear--I was very glad indeed to hear from you, and I shall be\n     only too happy to offer you the temporary assistance you desire.\n     You will recollect that I possess a villa just outside of Florence,\n     a mile or so north of Fiesole. I have never been inside of it but\n     once, in my childhood. The villa is furnished and kept in repair by\n     an ancient gardener and his wife. You and your friends are welcome\n     to occupy the Villa Ariadne as long as you please. You will find\n     one annoyance: in the ravine below the Eighth Corps has a shooting\n     range, and it is noisy when the wind is in the east. Of course you\n     will find all the chests, bureaus, sideboards and closets under\n     seal; for I have not been there since the death of my father. None\n     of the seals may be removed till I occupy the villa legally.\n     However, the gardener and his wife have silver and linen and china,\n     and with these you will be able to get along nicely. The fruits and\n     roses and garden truck will be wholly yours, and if you are\n     vegetarians you can live without expense for weeks. Take the villa,\n     then, and enjoy yourselves. It is rather out of the beaten track,\n     though at times it is invaded by tourists. Besides this letter I am\n     giving you one of official authority, for there is always some\n     formality. If you should need any financial aid, do not hesitate to\n     call upon me.\n\n     La Principessa di Monte Bianca.\n\n\"A villa!\" exclaimed Kitty rapturously. So many villas had she seen,\nguarded by Lombardy poplars or cypresses, that her mind hungered to live\nin one, if never so shortly.\n\n\"And the villa of a princess!\" sighed O'Mally. \"Fudge! I'm a patriot,\nall right, but may I be hanged if I shouldn't like to meet a princess,\nthe real article, just once. What do you say, Smith?\"\n\n\"Sure! It would be something to brag about. 'When I was in Florence my\nfriend, the Princess di Whadeyuhcallit, said to me,' and so forth.\nSounds good. But it's an idle dream, Tom, an idle dream.\"\n\n\"Will you permit me to read the letter?\" asked Worth.\n\nLa Signorina consented. Worth had an idea; it was as yet nebulous;\nstill, it was a shrewd idea, and needed only a small space to stand. The\nmoment he saw the letter the nebulous idea became opaque. The page was\nneatly typewritten in Italian, and only the signature was in ink. It was\na small, slanting, aristocratic signature.\n\n\"Do you read Italian?\" she asked with pardonable malice.\n\n\"Very little, and nothing on this page.\" Worth felt embarrassed under\nher glance. Still he continued to stare at the letter. The crest on the\npaper, the postmark on the envelope, convinced him of its authenticity.\nThe date was quite recent, and did not correspond with their unhappy\nsojourn in the Imperial City.\n\n\"The question is, shall we accept this offer?\" She refolded the letter.\n\"This was the plan I had in mind when we went to Monte Carlo, and a much\nbetter plan, too.\"\n\n\"Of course, we shall accept it,\" said Worth, confident that the mystery\nwas still there, but that for the present he had been fooled.\n\n\"But what's the matter with your playing the princess to the neighbors?\"\nsuggested O'Mally, his eyes laughing. \"I'll be the concierge, Smith the\nsteward, and Kitty your maid.\"\n\n\"And I?\" asked Worth.\n\n\"Oh, you can be her Highness' private secretary and attend to the\ncorrespondence.\"\n\nThe laughter which followed this was light-hearted and careless. Once\nmore worry had taken to wing and they were without burdens. Only La\nSignorina did not join the merriment. The sparks in her eyes, the silver\npoints of light, the flash of excitement, portended something. She rose\nwith a determined air.\n\n\"Mr. O'Mally makes a very good suggestion. It will be an adventure worth\nrecounting. I shall go as the princess. What sport with the country\ngentlemen! This will be an adventure after one's own heart. Her Highness\ncommands! Will it not be delightful?\"\n\nWorth looked at O'Mally, who looked at Smith, who looked at Kitty; then\nall four looked at La Signorina.\n\n\"Are you not lightening our trials by joking?\" asked Worth dubiously.\n\n\"I am positively serious.\"\n\n\"Impossible! It would be nothing less than madness to fly in the face of\nthis stroke of luck.\"\n\n\"Call it madness, if you like. I shall go as the princess.\"\n\n\"But the authorities! It will be prison.\"\n\n\"I am sufficiently armed for any event. It all depends upon your\ncourage,\" with a veiled insolence calculated to make any man commit any\nkind of folly.\n\n\"It is not a question of courage,\" replied O'Mally; \"it's prudence.\"\n\n\"Prudence in an Irishman?\" more insolent than ever.\n\n\"Oh, if you take that tone,\" said O'Mally, coloring, \"why, the thing is\ndone. Henceforth I am your major-domo. No one can call me a coward.\"\n\n\"O'Mally!\"\n\n\"That's all right, Worth,\" said O'Mally. \"I wouldn't turn back now for\nsixty-seven jails. You need not join.\"\n\n\"I shan't desert you in a strait like this,\" remarked Worth quietly.\n\"Only, I think La Signorina rather cruel to force such a situation upon\nus, when it was entirely unnecessary. Put me against the\ncorrespondence.\"\n\n\"If I wasn't flat broke,\" said Smith, \"I'd bow out politely. But where\nthe grub-stake goes I must go. But I don't like this business a little\nbit. Signorina, do tell us that it's a joke.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Kitty, still in doubt.\n\n\"I repeat, I am perfectly serious.\"\n\n\"But the consequences!\" protested Kitty, now terrified.\n\n\"Consequences? I shall find a way to avoid them.\"\n\n\"But supposing some one who knows the real princess happens along?\" said\nWorth, putting in his final argument.\n\n\"If I get into trouble of that sort, her Highness will help me out. I\nthank Mr. O'Mally for his suggestion.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" returned O'Mally dryly. Inwardly he was cursing his\nimpulsive Irish blood.\n\n\"It is agreed, then, that to-morrow we depart for Florence as the\nPrincipessa di Monte Bianca and suite?\"\n\nTears began to fill Kitty's eyes. To have everything spoiled like this!\nLa Signorina would land them all in prison.\n\n\"There's a legal side to it,\" Smith advanced cautiously. \"The law may\nnot see the jest from your point of view.\"\n\n\"I believe I am clever enough to meet any contingency of that order.\"\n\n\"I give up,\" said Worth despondently. \"But your princess must be a very\ndear friend for you to take such liberties with her name.\"\n\n\"She appreciates a jest as thoroughly as I do; moreover, she will stand\nby me in anything I may do. To-morrow morning, then. We shall go direct\nto Florence and engage carriages to take us out to the Villa Ariadne. We\nare all capable enough actors to carry out the venture successfully. And\nnow, to relieve Mr. Worth's chivalrous mind, I shall reclaim my pendant.\nYou will doubtless have enough money to forward yourselves to Florence.\nOnce you arrive there, you will leave the further burdens upon my\nshoulders. Come, Kitty, we must be going. I know that I can rely upon\nyou gentlemen to enter with full spirit into the adventure.\"\n\n\"We are all crazy, but who cares?\" O'Mally cried. But he trembled in his\nboots, and thought vainly of a certain comfortable chop-house on old\nBroadway.\n\nThe three men bowed ceremoniously. Worth opened the door for the women,\nand when it closed after them he turned savagely toward O'Mally.\n\n\"You--_ass_!\"\n\n\"There are others!\" retorted O'Mally, afire. \"You agreed; so drop it.\nBut what the devil are we going to do?\"\n\n\"That's the question!\" Smith got out his pipe.\n\n\"We are all going to the Villa Ariadne, and from there to jail!\" And\nWorth flung out of the salon.\n\n\"Jail,\" mused O'Mally. \"Blame me, if I don't believe he's right!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nGIOVANNI\n\n\nIt is in early morning that one should discover the Piazza San Marco.\nFew travelers, always excepting the Teutonic pilgrims, are up and about;\nand there is room for one's elbows in the great quadrangle. The doves\nare hungry then; and they alight on your hands, your arms, your\nshoulders, and even your hat. They are greedy and wise besides. Hidden\namong the statues above the arcades and in the cornices of the\ncathedral, they watch you approach the vender of corn. In a moment they\nare fluttering about you like an autumn storm of leaves, subsiding\nquickly; blue-grey doves with white under-wings and coral feet. During\nthe season the Venetian photographers are kept busy printing from\namateur films. For who is so indifferent as not to wish to be snapped a\nfew times with the doves forming a heavenly halo above one's head, one's\nbody in a sentimental pose, and one's eyes looking straight into the\ncamera? Well, well; this is as near saintliness as most of us will ever\nget.\n\nHow the warm sunshine brightens the worn marbles, or flashes from the\nmany windows, or sparkles from the oriental domes! And the colored\nmarbles of the ducal palace fairly palpitate. In the bronze fountain at\nthe left of the cathedral will be more doves taking their morning\nablutions.\n\nIt was such a picture Merrihew and Hillard, his guide, came upon the\nmorning following their arrival. They had not visited it during the\nnight. They had, with the usual impatience of men, gone directly to the\nCampo Santa Maria Formosa for the great reward. They had watched and\nwaited till near midnight, but in vain. For once Hillard's usual\nkeenness had been at fault. He had forgotten that the Campo was to be\nentered from two ways, by gondola and by foot. He and Merrihew had\nsimply guarded the bridge.\n\n\"I wonder why Giovanni ran away last night,\" said Merrihew, balancing a\ndove on his hand.\n\n\"I wonder, too,\" replied Hillard. \"It is possible that he did not\nrecognize me. I find that each day means a new wonder of some sort.\nGiovanni knows that I would do anything in my power to help him. But he\nruns away at the sight of me. In fact, they _all_ run away from me. I\nmust have the evil eye.\" He was shaking the cornucopia free of the last\nkernel of corn when he saw something which caused him to stifle an\nexclamation. \"Dan,\" he said, \"keep on feeding the doves. If I'm not back\ninside of ten minutes, return to the hotel and wait for me. No\nquestions; I'll tell you everything later.\"\n\nMerrihew's eyes widened. What now? His tongue longed to wag, but by this\ntime he was readily obeying Hillard in all things.\n\nA neat little woman was buying corn. Hillard stepped over to her and\ntouched her arm. As she faced him, he raised his hat, smiling.\n\n\"Oh!\" The corn spilled in a golden shower, and the doves, fickle as all\nflighty things are, deserted Merrihew for the moment.\n\n\"And where may I find your distinguished mistress?\" Hillard asked\npleasantly.\n\n\"She is not in the Campo Formosa, signore.\" Bettina, recovering her\nscattered wits, laughed.\n\n\"But you were--last night.\"\n\n\"Yes. I watched you and your friend for some time.\" Bettina's eyes were\nmerry. She would play with him. Everything was so tedious now.\n\n\"Your mistress is in Venice.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. At least her maid is.\"\n\n\"I should not dare suggest a bribe,\" he said slyly.\n\n\"You might make the attempt, just to see what I should do.\"\n\nMerrihew stood watching them, having lost interest in the doves.\n\n\"Supposing I should drop a hundred-lire note, accidentally, and walk\naway?\" Hillard twisted the ends of his mustache.\n\n\"But first I should have to tell you, accidentally, where my mistress\nis?\"\n\n\"That, of course.\"\n\n\"A hundred-lire note!\" To Bettina this was an enormous sum in these\nunfortunate days. Her resolution wavered. \"A hundred-lire note!\" She\nfelt that she could make no strong defense against such an assault.\n\nHillard drew the note from his pocket and crinkled it. \"A new dress and\nbits of lace.\"\n\nBettina saw duty one way and avarice the other. Her mistress would never\nknow. Still, if she should find out that she, Bettina, had betrayed her!\nWas a hundred-lire note worth the risk of losing her mistress? She began\nto think deeply. At length she shook her head sorrowfully.\n\n\"No, signore. I dare not.\"\n\n\"But a hundred lire!\"\n\n\"Ah, no, no!\" Bettina put her hands over her ears.\n\n\"Then I shall follow you step by step, all the day long.\"\n\nShe searched for the jest in his eyes, but there was none. Yes, he would\ndo it. How was she to escape him? Her glance traveled here and there. By\nthe glass-shop on the corner she espied two _carabinieri_. There lay the\nway.\n\n\"Do you see them?\" she asked.\n\n\"The _carabinieri_? Yes.\" But he swore under his breath, as he\nunderstood the drift of her inquiry.\n\n\"I shall ask them to hold you.\"\n\n\"But I have done nothing.\"\n\n\"Not yet, but you will attempt to follow me.\"\n\n\"Begin,\" he said, with a banter.\n\n\"What's the row, Jack?\" Merrihew called out impatiently. Why didn't they\ntalk in a language a fellow could understand?\n\n\"Stay where you are, Dan.\" To Bettina, Hillard repeated: \"Begin.\"\n\nShe dusted her hands of the corn and walked resolutely toward the\n_carabinieri_. Hillard, equally resolute, followed, but with a roving\neye which took in all things ostensibly save Bettina. He had a plan by\nwhich he proposed to circumvent any interference by the guardians. And\nBettina aided him, for she never turned her head till she stood at the\nside of the _carabinieri_.\n\n\"Signori, this man is following me,\" she said. Hillard came on and would\nhave passed, but they stopped him.\n\n\"You are following the signorina,\" said one.\n\n\"I? What put such a preposterous idea into the lady's head?\" Hillard\ndemanded indignantly.\n\nFor a moment the _carabinieri_ entertained some doubt.\n\n\"He is following me, I tell you,\" Bettina reiterated. \"I do not wish him\nill. Simply detain him till I am out of sight.\"\n\nThis was not unreasonable. \"It shall be as the little signorina wishes;\"\nand the _carabinieri_ laughed. It was some jest, and they would take\ntheir part in it willingly.\n\nHillard resigned, and Bettina took to her heels. Her victory was a\npermanent one, for the _carabinieri_ released Hillard only when they\nknew it would be impossible for him to take up the pursuit. So, taking\nhis defeat philosophically, Hillard returned to Merrihew.\n\n\"Well, what was it?\" asked Merrihew, scattering the doves.\n\n\"Did I ever tell you about Bettina?\"\n\n\"Bettina? No.\"\n\n\"Well, she is the maid. The women we are looking for are here in Venice.\nNow, what's on the program for the rest of the morning?\"\n\nMerrihew jammed his hands into his pockets. \"Oh, let's go and take a\nlook at the saints. I'm in the mood for it.\"\n\nSo the two set out at the heels of the German tourists. They went\nthrough the cathedral and the ducal palace, and when the bronze clock\nbeat out the noon hour Merrihew was bursting with information such as\nwould have filled any ordinary guide-book. He never dreamed that the\nworld held so many different kinds of stone or half so many saints. As\nthey started off for the hotel he declared that he would be willing to\ngive ten dollars for a good twenty-round fight, as a counter-irritant.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" cried Hillard.\n\n\"I know it. It's like caviar; the taste has to grow. I'm capable of only\na limited artistic education, Jack; so feed me slowly.\"\n\n\"You're in love.\"\n\n\"That's better than growing maudlin over a raft of saints who never did\nme any good. Your Titians and your Veroneses are splendid; there's color\nand life there. But these cross-eyed mosaics!\" Merrihew threw up his\nhands in protest.\n\nHillard let go his laughter. Merrihew was amusing, and his frankness in\nregard to his lack of artistic temperament in nowise detracted from his\nconsiderable accomplishments.\n\nAs they passed out of the quadrangle a man accosted them. It was\nGiovanni, with a week's growth of beard on his face, his clothes ragged\nand his shoes out at the toes. Swiftly he enjoined silence.\n\n\"Follow me,\" he said softly.\n\nHe led them through tortuous streets, over canal after canal, toward the\nCampo San Angelo. He came to a stop before a dilapidated tenement and\nsignified that the journey was at an end. The three mounted the dusty\nworn stairs of stone to the third landing; and from all sides they were\nassailed by the odor of fish and garlic. Giovanni opened a door and bade\nthem enter.\n\n\"Why did you run away from me last night, Giovanni?\"\n\n\"I was afraid. When I returned for you, you were gone. But last night I\nwas a fugitive, in hiding. To-day I am free,\" with an exultant note.\n\n\"Free?\" said Hillard, astonished.\n\n\"I shall explain. I have been to Paris. Come.\"\n\nSeated by the window which overlooked the little canal was a young\nwoman. Her hands lay passively in her lap, and her head was lowered. The\npose was resignation. She did not stir as they entered.\n\n\"You have found her?\" whispered Hillard, a great pity swelling his\nheart. What, after all, were his own petty troubles in the face of this\ntragedy?\n\n\"_Carissime?_\" called the father, his voice thrilling with boundless\nlove.\n\nAt the sound she turned her head. Her face, thin and waxen, was still\nbeautiful, ethereally beautiful, but without life. She was, perhaps,\nthree and twenty.\n\n\"I have brought an old friend to see you,\" said Giovanni. \"Do you\nremember the Signore Hillard?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! I am glad.\" She stood up.\n\nHillard offered his hand awkwardly, and hers touched it with the chill\ndampness of snow.\n\n\"We are going back to the Sabine Hills, Enrichetta and I.\" The old man\nrubbed his hands joyously. \"Eh, _carissime_?\"\n\n\"Yes, father,\" with a smile which had neither gladness nor interest in\nit.\n\n\"But dare you?\" asked Hillard in an undertone.\n\n\"Yes. A great noble has interceded for me. The news of his success came\nthis early morning. I am free; I may walk with men again.\"\n\nMerrihew leaned against the wall, uneasy and wishing himself anywhere\nbut here. Tender and generous, he hated the sight of pain. They were\ntalking in Italian, but intuitively he translated. What a devil of a\nworld it was!\n\nGiovanni made his daughter sit down again, patted her cheeks, then\npushed his friends into another room, closing the door.\n\n\"I found her,\" he said in English, the chords in his throat standing\nout. \"And Mother of Christ, how I have suffered! She was dancing. She\nhad to sit at tables and drink with the men. That, or the Seine. When\nshe saw me she gave a great cry and fell. She has not been like herself,\nbut that will pass away in time. Now she sits in silence and broods. I\nwent to the Italian ambassador. He heard my story in full. He wrote\npersonally to the king. To-day I am free. I have had to walk from Milan,\nalmost. I had little money. That letter of credit--so you call it?--is\nwith my cousin in Sorrento.\"\n\n\"How much will you need to get to Rome?\"\n\n\"Hold on, Jack,\" interposed Merrihew. \"I'll take care of the financial\nend. I won money at Monte Carlo, Giovanni; so it will hurt nobody if you\ntake five hundred francs.\"\n\nGiovanni scorned to hide his tears. Ah, these Americans! Who could match\nthem for impulsive generosity? \"I will pay it back,\" he said.\n\n\"No, I give it to you, Giovanni. It will ease my conscience of the sin\nof gambling.\"\n\n\"Both of you will live to a good old age,\" said Giovanni prophetically.\n\"Good men are needed in the world, and God doesn't take all of them\nyoung.\"\n\n\"And the man?\" Hillard could not refrain from putting this question.\n\nGiovanni looked down. \"The signore told me never to speak of that\nagain.\"\n\n\"So I did,\" replied Hillard. \"But all is changed now.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" Giovanni did not smile.\n\n\"Go back to your hills with your daughter and leave vengeance in the\nhands of God. Forget this man who has wronged you. You are free now; and\nwith care and love you may bring happiness back to her. Forget.\"\n\n\"If he does not cross my path; and if she lives. I have suffered too\ngreatly to forgive and forget. I promise not to seek him.\"\n\nThis was a great victory, and Hillard thrust out his hand. Giovanni did\nnot take it.\n\n\"No, signore, I have only promised not to seek him.\"\n\nMerrihew, to divert the trend of conversation, counted out five hundred\nfrancs. \"Here's your money, Giovanni.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" Giovanni put the bills away. In the best of times he was\nnot voluble. \"I shall now leave Venice at once. I have friends in\nFiesole, near Florence.\"\n\n\"Good-by, then, Giovanni. Take good care of yourself,\" said Hillard.\n\n\"And you will visit me when you come to Rome?\" asked Giovanni earnestly.\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\nThe old man went down to the street with them. They were so kind. He\nhated the thought of losing them. But let them come to the Sabines;\nthere would be wine in plenty, and tobacco, and cherries. He remained\nstanding in the door till they took the turn for the bridge. They waved\ntheir hands cheerily and vanished from sight. They never saw Giovanni\nagain; yet his hand was to work out the great epoch in Hillard's\ndestiny.\n\n\"Poor devil!\" said Merrihew. \"You remember, Jack, that I once went in\nfor medicine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I have some part of the gift yet. That little girl will not live\nthree months; heart. There is such a thing as a broken heart, and the\ngirl has it.\"\n\n\"Then Heaven help Giovanni and the man who caused this!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE ARIA FROM IL TROVATORE\n\n\n\"Shall we take a look into the Campo Formosa again to-night?\" asked\nMerrihew, stepping into the gondola.\n\n\"It will be a waste of time. Bettina will have warned them. What's the\nItalian coming to, anyhow? She refused a hundred francs. But I can see\nthat Mrs. Sandford had a hand in this latest event. She has probably\nwritten that we might look for them in the Campo.\" Hillard spoke in a\ndiscontented tone. \"Oh, bother the both of them! Let us loaf round the\nbarges of the serenaders and hear the singing. I want to be amused\nto-night.\"\n\n\"All right; we'll listen to the music,\" grumbled Merrihew. He wanted to\nfind Kitty right away. He would gladly have started out and explored\nevery Campo in Venice that night. Hillard's indifference annoyed him.\n\n\"To the barges of the troupes!\" said Hillard to Achille, who pushed off\nwith a series of short strokes.\n\nIn the great canal of San Marco the scene was like a water-carnival.\nHundreds of gondolas, with bobbing lights, swam slowly round the barges\nof the serenaders, who, for the most part, were fallen operatic stars or\nthose who had failed to attain those dizzy heights. Many of them had\ngood voices, but few of them last long in the damp Venetian night air.\nTo-night there were three of these belanterned barges, taking their\nstands about three hundred yards apart. The glowing coals of cigarettes\nand cigars of the men in the gondolas were like low-lying stars, and the\ncold, bright flash of jewels woke here and there among the many\nbeautifully gowned women. From one barge to another the gondolas\ndrifted, finally clustering round the middle barge of the Troupe San\nMarco, which offered the best voices. Between songs a man of acrobatic\naccomplishments would jump nimbly from the prow of one gondola to\nanother, stepping lightly here, balancing neatly there, and always with\nthe upturned tambourine extended for silver and copper largess.\n\nMerrihew sat in the bottom of the gondola, while Hillard lay sprawled\nacross the cushions on the seat. The prima donna was singing the\njewel-song from Faust, and not badly. Sometimes the low hum of voices\nfloated across the cadence of the song. Merrihew scanned the faces of\nall those near him, but never a face took on familiar lines. An Adriatic\nliner loomed up gray and shadowy behind them, and some of the crew were\nleaning idly over the rail. The song stopped. The man with the\ntambourine sallied forth. Out of the momentary silence came the\nindistinct tinkle of the piano in the barge beyond; some one over there\nwas bellowing the toreador's song. This died away amid a faint patter of\napplause. How clear all the sounds were! thought Merrihew. The tenor of\nthe San Marco troupe rose with the prima donna. It was _Il Trovatore_\nthis time; a bit noisy.\n\nWhat was that? Hillard was no longer lethargic. He stumbled over the\nrecumbent Merrihew.\n\n\"Why don't you walk all over me?\" growled Merrihew. \"Sit down!\"\n\n\"Be still!\" said Hillard roughly.\n\nFrom a gondola on the far side of the barge, standing out of the press\nand just beyond the radiance of the lanterns, never powerful at best,\ncame another voice, a voice which had a soul in it, a voice which broke\ninto song for the pure joy of it, spontaneously. Clear, thrilling, a\nvoice before which the world bows down. The prima donna in the barge was\nclever; she stopped. The tenor went on, however, recognizing that he was\nplaying opposite, as they say, to a great singer. Hillard's heart beat\nfast. That voice! There could not be another like it. And she was here\nin Venice!\n\n\"Achille,\" he said, \"do you hear that voice over there in the dark?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore.\"\n\n\"Push round to it. See, the singer is standing up now. Hurry!\"\n\nThis sounded important, and Merrihew scrambled to his feet. Yes, he,\ntoo, could see this unexpected cantatrice. In fact, everybody was\nbeginning to stand up. All interest was centered in this new voice.\nThen, as if conscious of this interest, the singer sat down, but still\nkept to the melody. Achille backed out of the jam, stole round the\nbarge, and craftily approached the outstanding gondola. The two men\nstill remained on their feet.\n\n\"Quick, Achille!\" For the far gondola was heading for the Grand Canal.\n\nMerrihew understood now. He grasped Hillard's arm excitedly.\n\n\"Follow!\" commanded Hillard. \"Ten lire if you can come up alongside that\ngondola. Can you see the number?\"\n\n\"It is 152, signore; Pompeo. It will be a race,\" doubtfully.\n\n\"No matter; follow. It will be worth your while.\"\n\nAnd a race it became. Both gondoliers were long past their youth, but\neach knew the exact weight and effort to be put upon the oar; no useless\nenergy, no hurried work, no spurting, but long, deep swinging strokes.\nUp the Grand Canal, past the brilliant hotels. The runaway gondola had\nperhaps a hundred yards the best of it. Achille hung on, neither losing\nnor gaining a foot.\n\n\"Sit down, signori!\" said Achille.\n\nHillard and Merrihew tumbled back upon the cushions.\n\n\"We shall not lose them this time, Dan.\"\n\n\"Are we gaining?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But wait till they turn into some small canal.\"\n\nThe first loop of the Grand Canal was turned; still Pompeo made no\neffort to seek the smaller canals. Not till he passed under the Rialto,\nwhich afforded him a deep shadow, did he turn. Swiftly he bore into the\ncanal which was filled with the postal-gondolas. But not so soon that\nAchille did not perceive and follow. On and on, soundless; now the\npursuer had the advantage over the pursued. It was Pompeo who had to\nwatch, to call; Achille had only to hang on. And he was gaining. A\nmoment later less than ten yards intervened. O for some clumsy barge to\nbar the way! Round past the Teatro Malibran, into the Rio di San Marina,\ninto a smaller canal again. Hillard now knew whither they were bound:\nthe Campo Formosa.\n\nAt each stroke Merrihew swung forward his body. The end of the race came\nsooner than any one expected. A police barge nosed round an ell; by the\ntime Pompeo was off again, the ferrule of the pursuing gondola scraped\npast Pompeo's blade. Pompeo called and Achille answered. There was a war\nof words, figure of a dog, name of a pig. Achille was in the wrong, but\nten lire were ten lire. And he knew that his gentlemen meant no harm.\n\nHillard caught the gondola by the rail and clung. The canal, lined with\na dozen lime barges, became so narrow that Achille could scarce paddle,\nand Pompeo's oar was useless, being partly under the opposing gondola.\nThe race was over.\n\n\"Signorina,\" said Pompeo, boiling with rage, \"shall I call the police?\"\n\n\"No, Pompeo,\" said his solitary passenger.\n\nWhen Merrihew saw that she was alone, his heart became heavy, and the\njoy of the chase was gone. But not so with Hillard. At last!\n\n\"To the Campo, Pompeo. Mr. Hillard, will you kindly follow? I would\nspeak to you alone, since there is no escape.\"\n\nHer tone chilled Hillard's ardor somewhat. But to speak to her again,\nand mayhap see her face!\n\n\"Doesn't want the police,\" whispered Merrihew. \"I told you so. Look out\nfor yourself.\"\n\nThe gondolas became free presently, and the way to the Campo Formosa was\nmade without further incident.\n\n\"She wishes to see me alone, Dan. You stay in the boat, I'll find out\nwhere Kitty is.\"\n\nThe gondolas became moored. Hillard jumped out and went to assist La\nSignorina, but she ignored his outstretched hand. This was not a\npromising beginning.\n\n\"To the church steps, Mr. Hillard,\" she said.\n\nHe followed her meekly. Merrihew sulked among the cushions.\n\nThe solitary electric lamp in the Campo made light enough; and when the\ntwo arrived at the steps the woman turned.\n\n\"What is it you wish?\" she asked. There was not the slightest agitation\nin her voice; there was not even curiosity.\n\n\"One look at your face,\" he answered simply.\n\nShe slowly removed the veil. Then, for the first time, he looked upon\nthe face of this woman who had burdened his dreams. The face was not\nlike any he had conjured. It seemed to him that Vecchio's--Paola\nVecchio's--Barbara had stepped down from her frame: beauty, tranquil,\nflawless beauty. A minute passed; he was incapable of speech, he could\nonly look.\n\n\"Well?\" she said, in the same expressionless tone.\n\n\"Let us begin at the beginning,\" he replied, with an effort to imitate\nthe evenness of her tone.\n\n\"Since this is to be the end.\"\n\n\"Why did you answer my personal in the first place? Why did you not\nignore it? I should have been left in peace.\"\n\n\"An impulse of the moment, which I shall always regret.\"\n\n\"Why did you let it go so far as to permit me to dine with you that\nmemorable night?\"\n\n\"A second impulse, equally regrettable.\"\n\n\"And why, after all had come to an apparent end, why did you send me\nthat mask?\"\n\nShe did not answer at once.\n\n\"Why?\" he repeated.\n\n\"It is unanswerable. Truthfully, I do not know.\"\n\n\"Have you thought what all this might mean to me?\" with warmth.\n\nAgain she was silent, but her eyes did not waver.\n\n\"When I heard your voice to-night I knew that doubt was no longer in my\nheart.\"\n\n\"Doubt?\"\n\n\"Yes, doubt. I knew then that the inexplicable had happened.\"\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"The inexplicable. For who will believe that it is possible for a sane\nman to fall in love with a voice? Had your face been scarred, as I once\nsuspected; had you committed some crime, as I once believed, it would\nnot matter. I am mad.\" He laughed angrily. \"Yes, I love you, knowing not\nwhat you are nor caring. I have been mad for weeks, only I did not see\nmy madness in true colors till this moment.\"\n\nThe light seemed to bother her eyes, for she turned her head aside,\ngiving this mad lover the exquisite profile of her face.\n\n\"You are indeed mad, or, rather, your jest is.\"\n\n\"Would to Heaven I were jesting! And why did you avoid me in Monte\nCarlo?\"\n\nShe realized that there was some justice in his questions and that she\nwas not altogether innocent of the cause of his madness, if it were\nthat.\n\n\"I did not speak to you because I wished to avoid this very moment. But\nsince it was destined to be, let us have done. What other questions\nwould you ask, Mr. Hillard?\"\n\n\"Who is that man--the Italian with the scar--who ran after you that\nnight?\"\n\n\"I will not answer that.\"\n\n\"'A lady? Grace of Mary, that is droll!'\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"I am only quoting the man with the scar. Those were the words he used\nin regard to you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is right; perhaps I am not a lady, according to his lights.\"\nBut she laughed.\n\n\"Do not laugh like that! What you are or have been, or might have been\nto him, is nothing to me. Only one fact remains clear, and that is, I\nlove you.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Hillard, you are only excited. You have been letting your\nimagination run away with you. Be sensible. Listen. You know nothing of\nme; you have neither my name nor my past--nothing. I may in truth be\neverything undesirable.\"\n\n\"Not to me!\"\n\n\"I may be a fugitive from the law.\"\n\n\"I do not believe it.\"\n\n\"There may be scars which do not show--in the heart, in the mind. I am\nsorry, terribly sorry. Heaven knows that I meant no harm. But it seems\nthat fate is determined that every move I make shall become a folly, the\nghost of which shall pursue me. I told you to forget me, that I had\nentered your life only to pass out of it immediately. Forget me!\" Her\nvoice was no longer without expression.\n\n\"Forget you? I would it were as easy as the asking! I say that I love\nyou, that I shall always love you. But,\" he added gently, lowering his\nvoice, \"I have asked nothing in return.\"\n\n\"Nothing in return?\" she murmured.\n\n\"No. I offer my love only that it may serve you without reward. Do you\nneed in your trouble a man's arm, a man's heart and mind?\"\n\n\"I need nothing;\" but her voice was now strangely sweet. So, she was\nloved by one who asked for nothing? This was not like the men she had\nknown. \"Do not misjudge me, Mr. Hillard. If indeed you believe that you\nlove me--incredible as it seems to me--I am proud of the honor. But\nfatality forbids that I accept not only your love but your friendship.\"\n\n\"Not even my friendship?\" bewildered. \"And why not?\"\n\n\"To answer that would only be adding to your hurt.\"\n\n\"You are a strange woman. You make it very hard.\"\n\n\"I have no alternative. The harder I make it, the better for your peace\nof mind. Once you are angry with me, once you are convinced that I am a\nhopeless puzzle, this fancy you call love will evaporate.\"\n\n\"Do not believe that.\"\n\n\"I never intended that you should see me again, and yet, against my\nbetter judgment, I have bared my face to you upon a simple request. I am\nnot without some vanity. Men have called me beautiful. But, oh! it is a\nsinister beauty; it has brought good to no one, least of all to its\nowner. You met Mrs. Sandford in Naples. Tell me what she said.\"\n\nHe sought refuge in silence.\n\n\"Did she not earnestly warn you against me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" reluctantly.\n\n\"And yet you would not heed her warning?\" sadly.\n\n\"I have told you that I am mad.\"\n\n\"I am coming to believe it. There are two of us. That dinner! And out of\nan innocent prank comes this! Folly, always folly!\" And as she\nremembered the piece of folly she was about to start out upon, she\nlaughed. \"Mad? Yes. Only, to your madness there is some reason; to mine,\nnone.\"\n\n\"So you sometimes recollect that night? You have not forgotten?\"\n\n\"No. The pleasure I derived has frequently returned to my mind.\"\n\n\"Ah, if only you would tell me what prevents friendship between us.\"\n\n\"You say you love me; is that not answer enough? Love and friendship are\nas separate as the two poles; and you are man enough of the world to\nknow that. I have no wish to wreck your life nor to make mine more\nmiserable. Well, I will tell you this: there is a barrier between us--a\nbarrier which only death can tear down or break asunder. Give up all\nidea, all thought of me. You will only waste your time. Come; is your\nlove strong enough to offer a single sacrifice?\"\n\n\"Not if it is to give you up.\"\n\n\"Very well. I see, then, that I must submit to this added persecution. I\ncan not force you.\"\n\n\"So long as I live I shall go on dreaming of you. So long as you keep me\nin darkness as to your trouble I shall pursue you. Oh, do not worry\nabout persecution. I shall only seek to be near you.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" she said, \"and good-by!\" She wound the veil round her\nface, took half a dozen steps, halted and turned, then went on, beyond\nthe light, into the dark.\n\nHow long Hillard stood by the steps of the church, watching that part of\nthe darkness through which she had disappeared, he never knew. Merrihew\ntapped him on the arm.\n\n\"Wake up, Jack, my boy!\" said Merrihew lightly. \"I thought, by the way\nyou mooned here, that you had fallen asleep on your feet. Where's\nKitty?\"\n\n\"Kitty? I forgot to ask, Dan,\" said Hillard dully.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTWO GENTLEMEN FROM VERONA\n\n\nIt was May in the Tuscany Hills; blue distances; a rolling horizon; a\nsky rimmed like a broken cup; a shallow, winding river, gleaming\nfitfully in the sun; a compact city in a valley, a city of red-tiled\nroofs, of domes and towers and palaces, of ruined ivy-grown walls and\nbattlements; shades of Michelangelo and Dante and Machiavelli, the\nBorgias and the Medicis: Florence, the city of flowers.\n\nUpon a hill, perhaps three miles to the northeast of the city, stood the\nancient Etruscan town of Fiesole. The flat white road which passes\nthrough the heart of the village leads into the mountains beyond. Here\none sees an occasional villa, surrounded by high walls of stone,\nplastered in white or pink, half hidden in roses, great, bloomy,\nsweet-scented roses, which of their quality and abundance rule the\nkingdom of flowers, as Florence once ruled the kingdom of art and\nlearning.\n\nThe Villa Ariadne rested upon a small knoll half a mile or more north of\nand above Fiesole, from which the panoramic beauty of Florence was to be\nseen at all times, glistening in the sun, glowing in the rain, sparkling\nin the night. A terrace reached to the very frontal walls, which were\ntwelve feet above the road. On the other side of the road swept down\nabruptly a precipitous ravine, dangerous to careless riders. A small\nstream dashed north, twisted, and joined the Mugnone, which in turn\nemptied into the drab waters of the Arno.\n\nThe villa was white and cool in the shade of dark cypresses and beeches\nand pink-blossomed horse-chestnuts. There were beds and gardens of\nflowers, and behind the villa a forest spread out and upward to the very\ntop of the overshadowing mountain. The gates and the porter's lodge were\nat that end of the confines nearest Fiesole. The old gardener and his\nwife lived in the lodge, earning an extra lira now and then by escorting\ntourists through the park and exhibiting the Della Robias, the Hadrian\nmosaic, the fountain by Donatello, and some antique marbles, supposed to\nhave been restored by Michelangelo. He never permitted any one to touch\nthese glories. Periodically the agents of the government paid a visit to\nascertain that none of these treasures had been sold or removed. The old\ngardener spoke some English.\n\nLife ran smoothly enough at the Villa Ariadne. La Signorina, at the very\nlast moment, surrendered to the entreaties of Kitty. She agreed not to\npass herself off as the princess. So they occupied the villa pleasurably\nand in safety. The police, as prescribed by law, made two visits and had\ngone away satisfied that, however odd they might be, the temporary\ntenants were proper persons. Among themselves each played the role\noriginally assigned. It was innocent fun now, and La Signorina seemed to\nenjoy the farce as much as any one. It was a great temptation not to\nprowl round the forbidden rooms, not to steal a look into the marvelous\nchests and sideboards, bulging as they knew with priceless glass and\nsilver and linen and laces. But La Signorina each day inspected the\nseals and uttered solemn warnings.\n\nThere was only one in this strange medley of persons who was not\ncontented with his lot, who cared not if the letter from home never came\nat all, and this person was Worth. To set down the trouble briefly, he\nwas desperately in love with La Signorina; and the knowledge of how\nhopeless this passion was, together with the frequent efforts he had put\nforth to repress the ardent declaration, were making him taciturn and\nsolitary. La Signorina never went down to Florence, not even to Fiesole;\nso Worth never joined his companions when they took, pleasant excursions\ninto the city.\n\nAs one fences in the dark, instinctively, so she kept him a foil's\nlength away. Yet she would have been glad had he spoken; she could have\nsilenced him effectually then. It was rather nerve-racking to wait for\nthis unwelcome declaration day by day. They had now lived in the Villa\nAriadne for two weeks, a careless, thoughtless, happy-go-lucky family.\nThe gossip might have looked askance at them; but La Signorina would not\nhave cared and the others would not have thought.\n\nEvery afternoon at two o'clock O'Mally and the ancient gardener would\nget together and give each other lessons, the one in English and the\nother in Italian. When this was done, a small flask of Chianti was\nforthcoming, and the old man enjoyed himself as he hadn't done since his\nyouth: a pipe of good tobacco and two glasses of Chianti. It was enough\nfor any reasonable man. He never inquired where the wine came from;\nsufficient it was to him that it came at all. And O'Mally saw no reason\nfor discovering its source; in fact, he admired Pietro's reticence. For,\nlike Planchet in the immortal _Three Musketeers_, O'Mally had done some\nneat fishing through one of the cellar windows. Through the broken pane\nof glass he could see bin upon bin of dust-covered bottles, Burgundy,\nclaret, Sauterne, champagne, and no end of cordials, prime vintages\nevery one of them. And here they were, useless to any one, turning into\njelly from old age. It was sad. It was more than that--it was a blessed\nshame. All these bottles were, unfortunately, on the far side of the\ncellar, out of reach, and he dared not break another window. Under this\nwhich served him lay the bin of Chianti. This was better than nothing;\nand the princess would never miss the few bottles he purloined.\nSometimes he shared a bottle with Smith, who was equally incurious.\n\nTo-day was warm and mellow. On the stone bench by the porter's lodge,\nhard by the gate, sat the old Florentine and O'Mally. From some unknown\nsource O'Mally had produced a concierge's hat and coat, a little\nmoth-eaten, a little tarnished, but serviceable. Both were smoking\nred-clay pipes with long bamboo stems.\n\n\"Pietro,\" said O'Mally, teetering, \"have you ever waited for money from\nhome?\"\n\nPietro puffed studiously, separating each word with all the care of a\nnaturalist opening the wings of some new butterfly. He made a negative\nsign.\n\n\"Well, don't you ever wait. There's nothing to it. But I've got an\nidea.\"\n\nPietro expressed some surprise.\n\n\"Yes, and a good idea, too. If any tourists come to-day, I propose to\nshow them round the place.\" O'Mally was quite in earnest.\n\nPietro's eyes flashed angrily. \"No, no! Mine, all mine!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going to rob you. I'll give you the tips, _amico_. What I\nwant is the fun of the thing. _Comprendery?_\"\n\nPietro understood; that was different. If his Excellency would pay over\nto him the receipts, he could conduct the tourists as often as he\npleased. Yes. To him it was tiresome. Most people were fools.\n\n\"Let's begin the lesson, then.\"\n\n\"_Come sta?_\" said Pietro, shifting his pipe.\n\n\"That's howdy do,\" said O'Mally. \"How is your wife?\"\n\n\"That ees _Come sta vostra_!\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"_Che tempo fa?_\" said Pietro suddenly.\n\nO'Mally frowned and jammed down the coal in his pipe. \"Who--no, how!--is\nthe weather. Who can say? _Che lo sa?_\"\n\n\"_Bene!_\"\n\nSolemnly they went over the same ground. To be sure, O'Mally always\nfailed to get the right twist to the final vowels, but he could make\nhimself understood, and that was the main thing. It was a rare moment to\nhim at night to strike Smith dumb by asking in Italian for a match, a\ncigar, or a book. Smith wondered how he did it; but when asked to join\nthe primary class at the porter's lodge, he always excused himself by\nsaying that he was deep in the writing of a comedy, which was true. If\nthere was a play in one's system, the Villa Ariadne was sure to bring it\nout.\n\nHaving finished the lesson for that day, they shared the flask of wine.\n\n\"It is old, Pietro,\" said O'Mally.\n\n\"_Vecchio, anticato_,\" responded Pietro with grave satisfaction.\n\n\"Hold on, now; this is no lesson. You talk English. Now about this guide\nbusiness. You will let me be guide if I turn over the profits; that is\nagreed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Pietro wished the flask had been twice as large.\n\n\"All right; that's fixed. By the way, Pietro, did you ever see the\nprincess?\"\n\nPietro looked into the bowl of his pipe. \"No; she not come here; never.\"\n\n\"Hum! I should, if I owned a place like this.\"\n\n\"Trouble.\"\n\n\"Trouble? How?\"\n\n\"I not know. But trouble she come bime-by.\"\n\n\"Rats!\" There was not a cloud in the sky, so far as O'Mally could see.\nAnd what trouble could possibly befall them?\n\n\"Sh!\" said Pietro.\n\nThe porter's bell rang loudly.\n\n\"Tourists!\" whispered O'Mally, sliding off the bench and buttoning up\nhis coat. \"Remember I am the guide; you get the lire.\"\n\nSurely Pietro understood, but he was nervous, doubting the ability of\nthis novice to demand the right sum for his labor.\n\nO'Mally settled his cap on straight and went to the gates and opened\nthem. A party of five Americans stood outside--two men, two women, and a\ngirl of twelve or fourteen. The whole party wore that eager look, now\nfamiliar to O'Mally, of persons who intended to see everything if they\neventually died for it.\n\n\"This is the Villa Ariadne?\" asked one of the women. She wore eyeglasses\nand had a bitter expression.\n\n\"It is,\" said O'Mally, touching his cap.\n\n\"He speaks English!\" cried the woman, turning joyfully to the others.\n\"We wish to see the villa and the park.\"\n\n\"The villa is now occupied, signora,\" replied O'Mally; \"but you are\npermitted to see the park and gardens.\"\n\n\"How much?\" asked one of the men.\n\n\"_Cinquanty_,\" said O'Mally; then correcting himself, \"for each person.\"\n\n\"Ten cents? Two lire fifty? Why, this is downright extortion!\" declared\nthe woman with the eyeglasses. She was vehement, too.\n\nO'Mally gave vent to a perfect Italian shrug, and put a hand out\nsuggestively toward the gates.\n\n\"Oh, come, dear,\" protested one of the men wearily; \"you've dragged us\nup here from Fiesole and I'm not going back without seeing what's to be\nseen.\"\n\n\"That's like you men; always willing to be robbed rather than stand upon\nyour rights. But I vow that you weak men will ruin travel by giving in\nall the time.\"\n\nThe man at whom this brief jeremiad was hurled painfully counted out two\nlire fifty, which was immediately transferred to the palm of the guide,\nwho ushered the wayfarers in.\n\nSolemnly Pietro watched them pass, wondering what the terms were.\nO'Mally led the party to the fountain.\n\n\"What's this?\" asked the woman.\n\n\"This,\" O'Mally began, with a careless wave of the hand, \"is the famed\nfountain by Donatello. It was originally owned by Catherine d'Medissy.\nThe Borgias stole it from her, and Italy and France nearly came to war\nover it.\"\n\n\"The Borgias?\" doubtfully. \"Were these two families contemporaneous?\"\n\n\"They were,\" scornfully. \"These Borgias were not the head of the family,\nhowever. Finally it fell into the hands of the first Prince d' Monty\nBianchy, and it has stood where you see it for three hundred years. It\nis considered the finest specimen of its kind. The Italian government\nhas offered fabulous sums for it.\"\n\n\"I thought the government could force the sale of these things?\"\n\n\"There has been some litigation over this property, consequently the\ngovernment can do nothing till the courts have settled the matter,\"\nrecited O'Mally glibly.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe quintet consulted their guide-books, but before they had located the\nparagraph referring to this work, O'Mally was cunningly leading them on\nto the Della Robbias which hung in the ruined pavilion. With a grand yet\nfamiliar air he declaimed over the marvelous beauties of this peculiar\nclay with an eloquence which was little short of masterful. He passed on\nto the antique marbles, touching them lightly and explaining how this\none was Nero's, that one Caligula's, that one Tiberius'. He lied so\neasily and gracefully that, wherever it rested, the tomb of Ananias must\nhave rocked. And whenever his victims tried to compare his statements\nwith those in the guide-books, he was extolling some other treasure.\nThey finally put the guide-books under their arms and trusted in the\nkindness of Providence.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said the woman who had not yet spoken, \"you speak English\nremarkably well? There is an accent I do not quite understand.\"\n\nO'Mally shivered for a moment. Was she going to spring Dago on him? \"I\nam Italian,\" he said easily. \"I was born, however, in County Clare. My\nfather and mother were immigrants to Ireland.\" His face was as solemn as\nan owl's.\n\n\"That explains it.\"\n\nO'Mally took a new lease of life. \"Now let me show you the Hadrian\nmosaic, from the Villa Hadrian in Tivoli, out of Rome.\" He swept back\nthe sand. \"Is it not magnificent?\"\n\n\"Looks like a linoleum pattern,\" was the comment of one of the men.\n\n\"You are not far from right,\" said O'Mally. \"It was from this very\nmosaic that the American linoleums were originally designed.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the woman with the glasses.\n\n\"Yes, Signora.\"\n\n\"Ma,\" whispered the girl, \"ask him for one of those buttons.\"\n\nThe stage-whisper was overheard by O'Mally. \"These buttons,\" he\nexplained, \"cost a lira each; but if the signorina really wishes\none--\" And thus another lira swelled the profits of the day. O'Mally\nwondered if he ought not to keep this one lira since it was off his own\ncoat and not Pietro's.\n\nOn the balcony of the villa appeared two women. The woman with the\nglasses at once discovered them.\n\n\"Who is that handsome woman?\" she demanded.\n\nO'Mally paled slightly. \"That,\" touching his cap respectfully, \"is her\nHighness, La Principessy d' Monty Bianchy, the owner of the Villa\nAriadne.\" Ha! He had them here.\n\nThe tourists stared at the balcony. A real live princess! They no longer\nregretted the two lire fifty. This was something worth while.\n\n\"We did not know that the princess lived here.\"\n\n\"It is but a temporary visit. She is here incognito. You must not repeat\nwhat I have told you,\" was O'Mally's added warning.\n\nOn the balcony the two women were talking quietly.\n\n\"What in the world is that man O'Mally up to now?\" said La Signorina\ncuriously.\n\n\"Can't you see?\" replied Kitty. \"He is acting as guide in Pietro's\nplace.\"\n\n\"Merciful heavens!\" La Signorina retired, stifling her laughter.\n\nAt the gates O'Mally received his _pourboire_ of twenty centesimi, saw\nhis charge outside, closed and locked the gates, and returned to Pietro,\nwho was in a greatly agitated state of mind.\n\n\"_Quando!_\" he cried.\n\nO'Mally handed him the exact amount, minus the lira for the button.\n\n\"_Santa Maria!_ All thees? How? No more I take dem; you!\"\n\nO'Mally sat down on the bench and laughed. It was as good a part as he\nhad ever had.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly evening. La Signorina leaned over the terrace wall, her hand idly\ntrailing over the soft cool roses. Afar down the valley shimmered the\nlights of Florence. There were no outlines; no towers, no domes, no\nroofs were visible; nothing but the dim haze upon which the lights\nserenely floated. It might have been a harbor in the peace of night. To\nthe south, crowning the hills with a faint halo, the moon, yet hidden,\nwas rising across the heavens. Stretched out on either hand, white and\nshadowy, lay the great road. She was dreaming. Presently upon the\nsilence came the echo of galloping horses. She listened. The sound came\nfrom the north. It died away, only to return again sharply, and this\ntime without echo. Two horsemen came cantering toward the Villa Ariadne.\nThey drew down to a walk, and she watched them carelessly. It was not\nlong before they passed under her. She heard their voices.\n\n\"Jack, this has been the trip of my life. Verona, Padua, Bologna, and\nnow Florence! This is life; nothing like it.\"\n\n\"I am glad, Dan. It has been enjoyable. I only hope our luggage will be\nat the hotel for us. Twelve days in riding-breeches are quite enough for\na single stretch.\"\n\nLa Signorina's hand closed convulsively over a rose, and crushed it. The\nvine, as she did so, gave forth a rustling sound. The men turned and\nglanced up. They saw a woman dimly. That was all.\n\n\"A last canter to Fiesole!\"\n\n\"Off she goes!\"\n\nThe two went clattering down the road.\n\nLa Signorina released the imprisoned rose, and, unmindful of the prick\nof the thorn, walked slowly back to the villa. It was fatality that this\nman should again cross her path.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nKITTY DROPS A BANDBOX\n\n\n\"What's the matter, Jack? Whenever you smoke, your cigar goes out; you\nread a newspaper by staring over the top of it; you bump into people on\nthe streets, when there is plenty of room for you to pass; you leave\nyour watch under the pillow and have to hike back for it; you forget,\nyou are absent-minded. Now, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Dan,\" said Hillard, relighting his cigar.\n\n\"Or you won't tell.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that's more like it.\"\n\n\"It's that woman, though you will not acknowledge it. By George, I'd\nlike to meet her face to face; I'd give her a piece of my mind.\"\n\n\"Or a piece of your heart!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" cried Merrihew, flipping his cigar-ash to the walk below,\ncareless whether it struck any of the leisurely-going pedestrians or\nnot.\n\n\"You have not seen her face, Dan; I have.\"\n\n\"Oh, she may be a queen and all that; but she has an evil influence over\nall the people she meets. Here's Kitty, following her round, and the\nLord knows in what kind of trouble. She has hooked you, and presently\nyou'll be leaving me to get back home the best way I can.\"\n\n\"It is quite possible, my boy.\" And Hillard did not smile.\n\n\"Come, Jack, have you really got it? If you have, why, we'll pack up and\nleave by the next steamer. I don't care to wander about Italy with a\nsick man on my hands.\"\n\n\"Don't be hard on me, Dan,\" pleaded Hillard, smiling now. \"Think of all\nthe Kitty Killigrews you've poured into my uncomplaining ears!\"\n\n\"I got over it each time.\" But Merrihew felt a warmth in his cheeks.\n\n\"Happy man! And, once you see the face of this adventuress, as you call\nher, Kitty Killigrew will pass with all the other lasses.\"\n\n\"I?\" indignantly. \"Rot! She won't hold a candle to Kitty.\"\n\n\"No, not a candle, but the most powerful light known to the human\neye--perfect beauty.\" Hillard sighed unconsciously.\n\n\"There you go again!\" laughed Merrihew. \"You tack that sigh to\neverything you say; and that's what I've been complaining about.\"\n\nHillard was human; he might be deeply in love, but this had not\ndestroyed his healthy sense of humor. So he laughed at himself.\n\nThen they mused silently for a while. On either side, from their\nwindow-balcony, the lights of Lungarno spread out in a brilliant\nhalf-circle, repeating themselves, after the fashion of women, in the\nmirror of the Arno. On the hill across the river the statue of David was\nvisible above the Piazza Michelangelo.\n\n\"You never told me what she was like,\" said Merrihew finally.\n\n\"Haven't I? Perhaps you never asked. We went through the Pitti Palace\nto-day. I couldn't drag you from Raphael's _Madonna of the Chair_. She\nis as beautiful as that.\"\n\n\"Imagination is a wonderful thing,\" was Merrihew's solitary comment.\n\n\"Mine has not been unduly worked in this instance,\" Hillard declared\nwith emphasis. \"Beauty in women has always been to me something in the\nabstract, but it is so no longer. There is one thing which I wish to\nimpress upon you, Dan. She is not an adventuress. She has made no effort\nto trap me. On the contrary, she has done all she could to keep out of\nmy way.\"\n\n\"It's a curious business; the dinner, the mask, the veil, the mystery. I\ntell you frankly, Jack, something's wrong, and we shall both live to\nfind it out.\"\n\n\"But what? Heaven on earth, what? Haven't I tried to figure it out till\nmy brain aches? I haven't gone forward a single inch. On the steps of\nthe Formosa I told her that I loved her. There, you have it! I was in\ndoubt till I looked at her face, and then I knew that I had met the one\nwoman, and that there was a barrier between us that was not\nself-imposed. Not even friendship, Dan; not even an ordinary thing like\nthat. I have spoken to this woman on only two occasions, and only once\nhave I seen her face. I am not a disciple of the theory of love at first\nsight. I never shall be. An educated, rational man must have something\nbesides physical beauty; there must be wit, intellect, accomplishments.\nUsually we recognize the beauty first, and then the other attributes,\none by one, as the acquaintance ripens. With me the things have been\nswitched round. The accomplishments came first; I became fascinated by a\nvoice and a mind. But when I saw her face.... Oh, well! Mrs. Sandford\nwarned me against her; the woman herself has warned me; the primal\ninstinct of self-preservation has warned me; yet, here I am! I had not\nintended to bother you, Dan.\"\n\n\"It doesn't bother me, it worries me. If I have hurt you with any of my\ncareless jests, forgive me.\" Merrihew now realized that his friend was\nin a bad way. Still, there was a hidden gladness in his heart that\nHillard, always railing at his (Merrihew's) affairs, was in the same\nboat now, and rudderless at that.\n\n\"You haven't hurt me, Dan. As a matter of fact, your gibes have been a\ntonic. They have made me face the fact that I was on the highroad to\nimbecility.\"\n\n\"What shall you do?\"\n\n\"Nothing. When we have seen Florence we'll drop down to Perugia and\nRome, then up to the Italian lakes; after that, home, if you say. The\nbass season will be on then, and we've had some good sport on Lake\nOntario.\"\n\n\"Bass!\" Merrihew went through the pleasant foolery of casting a line, of\ndrawing the bait, of lifting the hook, and of reeling in. \"Four pounds,\nJack. He fit hard, as old Joe used to say. Remember?\"\n\nAnd so naturally they fell to recounting the splendid catches of the\ngamiest fish in water. When the interest in this waned, Hillard looked\nat his watch.\n\n\"Only nine,\" he said. \"Let's go over to Gambrinus' and hear the music.\"\n\n\"And drink a boot of beer. Better than moping here.\"\n\nThe Hotel Italie was but a few blocks from the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele.\nThey found the _Halle_ crowded, noisy and interesting. The music was\ngood, as it always is in Italy, and the beer had the true German flavor,\nM\u00c3\u00bcnchener. Handsome uniforms brightened the scene; and there was\nflirting and laughter, in which Merrihew found opportunity to join.\n\n\"If Kitty should see you!\"\n\n\"Well, what if she did? When I'm married to her it will be mutually\nunderstood that so long as I do not speak to them I may look at pretty\nwomen.\"\n\n\"You seem very sure of marrying her.\"\n\n\"It's only a matter of time. The man who hangs on wins finally.\"\nMerrihew had lost none of his confidence.\n\n\"I see; they marry you to get rid of you,\" said Hillard. \"Yes, the man\nwho hangs on finally wins, in love or war or fortune. But I haven't\nanything to hang on to.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" said Merrihew, wagging his head.\n\nFrom the _Halle_ they went down-stairs to the billiard-room. The pockets\nin the table bothered Merrihew; he did not care particularly for the\nEnglish game; and the American table was occupied by a quartet of young\nAmericans who were drinking champagne like Pittsburg millionaires. The\nventilation was so bad that the two friends were forced to give up the\ngame. Under the arcade they found a small table. It was cool and\ndelightful here, and there was a second boot of Munich beer.\n\nOfficers passed to and fro, in pairs or with women. Presently two\nofficers, one in the resplendent uniform of a colonel, went past.\nMerrihew touched Hillard with his foot excitedly. Hillard nodded, but\nhis pulse was tuned to a quicker stroke.\n\n\"I hope he doesn't see us,\" he said, tipping his panama over his eyes.\n\nMerrihew curled the ends of his juvenile mustache and scowled fiercely.\n\n\"This is his post evidently,\" he said. \"What a smacking uniform! He must\nhave had a long furlough, to be wandering over Europe and America. If I\nget a chance I'm going to ask a waiter who he is.\"\n\n\"So long as he doesn't observe us,\" said Hillard, \"I have no interest in\nhis affairs.\" Had he none? he wondered. \"A lady? Grace of Mary, that is\ndroll!\" The muscles in his jaws hardened.\n\n\"But you twisted his cuffs for him that night in Monte Carlo. Monte\nCarlo!\" reminiscently. \"Eighteen hundred dollars, my boy, and a good\nfourteen still in my inside pocket. Wasn't I lucky? But I'll never\nforgive Kitty for running away from us. That's got to be explained fully\nsome day.\"\n\n\"He is coming this way again, Dan,\" Hillard observed quietly.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThey waited. Hillard changed his mind; he pushed back his hat and held\nup his chin. If the man with the scar saw him and spoke he would reply.\nThe colonel, glancing at the pair casually, halted. At first he was not\ncertain, but as he met the steady eyes of Hillard he no longer doubted.\nIt was true. He turned and spoke to his brother officer. Merrihew's\nthroat grew full, but not from fear. The man with the scar stepped over\nto the table and leaned with his hands upon it. There was a savage humor\nin his dark eyes.\n\n\"Did I not tell you that we should meet again?\" he said to Hillard.\n\"This is a pleasant moment.\" He stood back again.\n\n\"Are you speaking to me?\" asked Hillard, not the least perturbed. He had\nnot stirred in his chair, though every muscle in his body was alert and\nready at a moment's call.\n\n\"Certainly I am speaking to you. You understand Italian sufficiently\nwell. This is the fellow,\" speaking to his companion, at the same time\ndrawing off his gloves, \"this is the fellow I spoke to you about.\"\n\n\"I object to the word fellow,\" said Hillard, smiling grimly. \"Besides, I\ndo not know you.\"\n\n\"Ah, discreet!\" sneered the man with the scar.\n\n\"Be careful, Enrico,\" warned the brother officer. \"There are many about,\nand a scene is not wise. Ask the American to take a walk. You could\narrange with more ease.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hillard, \"but I am perfectly comfortable where I am.\nIf this gentleman has anything to say, he must say it here and now.\"\n\n\"Colonel!\" cried the subaltern, as his senior smoothed the gloves and\nplaced them carefully in his left hand, closing his fingers over them.\n\n\"Oh, I am calm. But I have been dreaming of this moment. Now!\" The\ncolonel readdressed Hillard. \"You meddled with an affair that night in\nwhich you had no concern,\" he began truculently.\n\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\n\nMerrihew eyed Hillard nervously. He did not understand the words, worse\nluck, but the tone conveyed volumes. It was crisp and angry. Hillard\npossessed a temper which was backed by considerable strength, and only\non rare occasions did this temper slip from his control. Thoroughly\nangry, Hillard was not a happy man to antagonize.\n\n\"Yes, I am sure. And yet, as I think it over, as I recollect the\nwoman,\" went on the colonel, with a smile which was evil and\ninsinuating.... \"Well, I shall not question you. The main thing is, you\nannoyed me. In Monte Carlo I was practically alone. Here the scene is\ndifferent; it is Florence. Doubtless you will understand.\" He struck out\nwith the gloves.\n\nBut they never touched Hillard's face. His hand, expectant of this very\nmovement, caught the assailant's wrist, and, with a quick jerk, brought\nhim half-way across the table. He bore down on the wrist so fiercely\nthat the Italian cried faintly. Hillard, with his face but a span from\nthe other's, spoke tensely, but in an undertone.\n\n\"Listen carefully to what I have to say, signore. I understand\nperfectly, but I shall fight no duel. It is an obsolete fashion, and\nproves nothing but mechanical skill. I do not know what kind of\nblackguard you are, but blackguard I know you to be. If you ever address\nme again I promise on the word of a gentleman to give you a whipping\nwhich will have a more lasting effect upon your future actions than a\ndozen sermons. If that will not serve, I shall appeal to the police.\"\n\n\"Poltroon!\"\n\n\"As often as you please!\" Hillard flung him off roughly.\n\nA small but interested crowd had gathered by now, and Merrihew saw\nvisions of Italian jails. Through the crowd the ever-present\n_carabinieri_ shouldered their way.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said the colonel, motioning them to stand back, which\nthey did with a sign of respect. This sign gave Hillard some food for\nthought. His antagonist was evidently a personage of some importance.\n\n\"Figure of an American pig!\"\n\nHillard laughed. \"I might have broken your wrist, but did not. You are\nnot grateful.\"\n\nThe _carabinieri_ moved forward again.\n\n\"The affair is over,\" said Hillard amiably. \"This officer has mistaken\nme for some one he knows.\"\n\nThe scar was livid on the Italian's cheek. He stood undecided for a\nspace. His companion laid a restraining hand on his arm. He nodded, and\nthe two made off. What might in former days have been a tragedy was\nnothing more than a farce. But it spoiled the night for Merrihew, and he\nwas for going back to the hotel. Hillard agreed.\n\n\"At first I wanted you to give him a good stiff punch,\" said Merrihew,\n\"but I am glad you didn't.\"\n\n\"We should have slept in the lockup over night if I had. The\n_carabinieri_ would not have understood my excuses. If our friend is\nleft-handed, he'll be inconvenienced for a day or two. I put some force\ninto that grip. You see, Dan, the Italian still fights his duels.\nDueling is not extinct in the army here. An officer who refuses to\naccept a challenge for a good or bad cause is practically hounded out of\nthe service. It would have been a fine joke if I had been fool enough to\naccept his challenge. He would have put daylight through me at the first\nstroke.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" replied Merrihew loyally. \"You are the crack\nfencer in New York.\"\n\n\"But New York isn't Florence, my boy. I'll show you some fencing\nto-morrow. If my old fencing master, Foresti Paoli, is yet in Florence,\nI'll have him arrange some matches. New York affairs will look tame to\nyou then.\"\n\n\"But what has he to do with your vanishing lady?\"\n\n\"I should like to know.\"\n\n\"I wish I had thought to ask a waiter who the duffer is. Did you notice\nhow respectful the _carabinieri_ were?\"\n\n\"It set me thinking. Oh, I've a premonition that we haven't seen the\nlast of this distinguished gentleman. Perhaps we'll find out who he is\nsooner than we care to.\"\n\n\"When the time comes,\" said Merrihew with a laugh, \"be sure you soak it\nto him, and an extra one for me.\"\n\nEarly on the morrow they rode out to the Cascine, formerly a dairy-farm,\nbut now a splendid park. The bridle-paths are the finest in the world,\nnot excepting those in the Bois de Bologne in Paris. They are not so\nlong, perhaps, but they are infinitely more beautiful. Take, for\ninstance, the long path under a tunnel of enormous trees, a bridle-path\nwhere ten men may ride abreast with room to spare, and nearly half a\nmile in length; there is nothing like it.\n\n\"I tell you what it is, Jack; Italy may put a tax on salt and sea-water,\nbut always gives something in return; she puts up a picture-gallery or a\nmuseum, or a park like this. What do we get back in America? _Niente!_\"\n\nFor two hours they romped through the park, running races, hurdling, and\nplaying rough pranks upon each other, such as only expert riders dare\nattempt. They were both hardened by the long ride down to Florence, a\npair of animals as healthy as their mounts. They had determined not to\nsell the horses till the last moment. A riding-master in the Via Lorenzo\nii Magnifico agreed to board them against the time of sale.\n\nIn the three days in Florence they had been through the galleries and\nthe museums; and Merrihew, to his great delight, began to find that he\ncould tell a Botticelli from a Lippi at first glance. He was beginning\nto understand why people raved over this style or that. There was\nsomething so gentle, so peaceful in a Botticelli that he really\npreferred it to some of the famed colorists, always excepting Veronese,\nto whom he had given his first admiration.\n\nFor luncheon this day Hillard took him to Paoli's in the Via dei\nTavolini--the way of the little tables. Here Merrihew saw a tavern such\nas he had often conjured up while reading his Dumas; sausages and hams\nand bacons and garlic and cheeses and dried vegetables hanging from the\nceiling, abrupt passages, rough tables and common chairs and strange\ndishes; oil, oil, oil, even on the top of his coffee-cup, and magnums of\nred and white Chianti. Hillard informed him that this was the most\nfamous Bohemian place in the city, the rendezvous of artists, sculptors,\nwriters, physicians, and civil authorities. The military seldom\npatronized it, because it was not showy enough. Merrihew enjoyed the\nscene, with its jabber-jabber and its clatter-clatter. And he was still\nhungry when he left, but he would not admit it to Hillard, who adapted\nhimself to the over-abundance of oil with all the zest of an expatriated\nTuscan.\n\nAt three o'clock they went to the fencing academy of Foresti Paoli, near\nthe post-office. Foresti was a fine example of the military Italian of\nformer days. He was past sixty, but was as agile as any of his\ncelebrated pupils. As Hillard had written him the night before, he was\nexpected. He had been a pupil of Foresti's, and the veteran was glad to\nsee him. Merrihew saw some interesting bouts, and at length Foresti\nprevailed upon Hillard to don the mask against an old pupil, a physician\nwho had formerly been amateur champion of Italy. Hillard, having been in\nthe saddle and the open air for two weeks, was in prime condition; and\nhe gave the ex-champion a pretty handful. But constant practice told in\nthe end, and Hillard was beaten. It was fine sport to Merrihew; the\nquick pad-pad of the feet on the mat, the short triumphant cries as the\nfoil bent almost double, and the flash of the whites of their eyes\nbehind the mask. Merrihew knew that he should love Florence all the rest\nof his days.\n\nThey were entering the Via Tornabuoni, toward the Havana cigar-store,\nwhen a young woman came out of the little millinery shop a few doors\nfrom the tobacconist's. Immediately Hillard stepped to one side of her\nand Merrihew to the other.\n\n\"You can not run away this time, Kitty Killigrew!\" cried Merrihew\njoyously.\n\nKitty closed her eyes for a second, and the neat little bandbox slipped\nto the sidewalk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nAN INVITATION TO A BALL\n\n\nIn the Villa Ariadne the wonderful fountain by Donatello was encircled\nby a deep basin in which many generations of goldfish swam about. Only\nthe old gardener knew the secret of how these fish lived through the\nchill Florentine winters. Yet, every spring, about the time when the\ntourists began to prowl round, the little goldfish were to be seen\nagain, ready for bread-crumbs and bugs of suicidal tendencies. Forming a\nkind of triangle about the basin were three ancient marble benches, such\nas the amiable old Roman senators were wont to lounge upon during the\nheat of the afternoon, or such as Catullus reclined upon while reading\nhis latest lyric to his latest affinity. At any rate, they were very\nold, earth-stained and time-stained and full of unutterable history, and\nwith the eternal cold touch of stone which never wholly warms even under\nwarmest sun. The kind of bench which Alma-Tadema usually fills with\ndiaphanous maidens.\n\nAt this particular time a maiden, not at all diaphanous, but mentally\nand physically material, sat on one of these benches, her arms thrown\nout on either side of the crumbling back, her chin lowered, and her eyes\nthoughtfully directed toward the little circle of disturbed water where\nthe goldfish were urging for the next crumb. Now, as Phoebus was\nsomewhere near four in the afternoon, he was growing ruddy with effort\nin the final spurt for the western horizon. So the marbles and the\nfountain and the water and the maiden all melted into a harmonious\ngolden tone.\n\nMerrihew was not so poetical as to permit this picture to go on\nindefinitely; so he stole up from behind with all the care of a\npractised hunter till he stood directly behind the maiden. She still\ndreamed. Then he put his hands over her eyes. She struggled for a brief\nmoment, then desisted.\n\n\"It is no puzzle at all,\" she declared. \"I can smell horse, horse, and\nagain horse. Mr. Merrihew--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know all about it. I should have fetched along a sachet-powder.\nI never remember anything but one thing, Kitty, and that's you.\" He came\nround and sat down beside her. \"There's no doubt that I reek of the\nanimal. But the real question is,\" bluntly, \"how much longer are you\ngoing to keep me dangling on the string? I've been coming up here for\nten days, now, every afternoon.\"\n\n\"Ten days,\" Kitty murmured. She was more than pretty to-day, and there\nwas malice aforethought in all the little ribbons and trinkets and\nfurbelows. She had dressed expressly for this moment, but Merrihew was\nnot going to be told so. \"Ten days,\" she repeated; and mentally she\nrecounted the pleasant little journeys into the hills and the\ncherry-pickings.\n\n\"And dangling, dangling. I've been hanging in mid-air for nearly a year\nnow. When are you going to put me out of my misery?\" His tone was\nchiding and moody.\n\n\"But am I to be blamed if, after having refused twice to marry you, you\nstill persist?\" Kitty assumed a judicial air.\n\n\"All you have to do,\" sadly, \"is to tell me to clear out.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" cried Kitty wrathfully. \"If I tell you to go it will\nbe for good; and I don't want you to go that way. I like you; you are\ncheerful and amusing, and I find pleasure in your company. But every day\nin the year, breakfast and dinner!\" She appealed to the god in the\nfountain. What unreasonable beings men were!\n\n\"But you haven't refused me this time.\"\n\n\"Because I wish to make it as easy as possible for you.\" Which of the\ntwo meanings she offered him was lost upon Merrihew; he saw but one, nor\nthe covert glance, roguish and mischievous withal. \"Come, let us be\nsensible for ten minutes.\"\n\nMerrihew laid his watch on the bench beside him. Kitty dimpled.\n\n\"Don't you love it in Florence?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" scraping the gravel with his crop. \"Hillard says I'm\nfinishing my bally education at a canter. I can tell a saint from a\ngentleman in a night-gown, a halo from a barrel-hoop, and I can drink\nChianti without making a face.\"\n\nKitty laughed rollickingly. For beneath her furbelows and ribbons and\ntrinkets she was inordinately happy and light of heart. Her letter had\ncome; she was only waiting for the day of sailing; and she was to take\nback with her the memory of the rarest adventure which ever befell a\nperson, always excepting those of the peripatetic sailor from Bagdad.\n\n\"I want to go home,\" said Merrihew, when her laughter died away in a\nsoft mutter.\n\n\"What! leave this beautiful world for the sordid one yonder?\"\n\n\"Sordid it may be, but it's home. I can speak to and understand every\nman I meet on the streets there; there are the theaters and the club and\nthe hunting and fishing and all that. Here it's nothing but pictures and\nconcierges and lying cabbies. If I could collect all my friends and\nplant 'em over here, why, I could stand it. But I'm lonesome. Did you\never try to spread frozen butter on hot biscuits? Well, that's the way I\nfeel.\"\n\nThis metaphor brought tears of merriment to Kitty's eyes. She would have\nlaughed at anything this day.\n\n\"Daniel, you are hopeless.\"\n\n\"I admit it.\"\n\n\"How beautiful the cypresses are in the sunshine!\" she exclaimed,\nstanding.\n\nHe reached out and caught her hand, gently pulling her down to the\nbench.\n\n\"The ten minutes are up,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, I said let us be sensible for ten minutes,\" she demurred.\n\n\"I've been telling you the truth; that's sensible enough. Kitty, will\nyou marry me?\"\n\n\"Could you take care of me?\"\n\n\"I have these two hands. I'll work.\"\n\n\"That would be terrible! Oh, if you were only rich!\"\n\n\"You don't mean that, Kitty.\"\n\n\"No,\" relenting, \"I don't. But you bother me.\"\n\n\"All right. This will be the last time. Will you marry me? I will do all\na man can to make you happy. I love you with all my heart. I know.\nYou're afraid; you've an idea that I am fickle. But not this time,\nKitty, not this time. Will you?\"\n\n\"I can not give up the stage.\" She knew very well that she could, but\nshe had an idea.\n\n\"I don't ask even that. I'll travel with you and make myself useful.\"\n\n\"You would soon tire of that.\" But Kitty eyed him with a kindly look. He\n_was_ good to look at. Kitty was like the timid bather; she knew that\nshe was going to take the plunge, but she must put one foot into the\nwater, withdraw it, shudder, and try it again.\n\n\"Tire?\" said Merrihew. \"If I did I shouldn't let you know it. I'm a\nhomeless beggar, anyhow; I've always been living in boarding-houses and\nclubs and hotels; it won't matter so long as you are with me.\"\n\nKitty threw a crust to the goldfish and watched them swirl about it\ngreedily. Merrihew had no eyes but for her. Impulsively he held out his\nhand. Kitty looked at it with thought; this would be the final plunge.\nThen, without further hesitance, indifferent to the future or the past,\nconscious only of the vast happiness of the present, Kitty laid her hand\nin his. He would have drawn her into his arms had not they both seen\nO'Mally pushing through the box-hedge, followed by some belated\ntourists. Merrihew swore softly and Kitty laughed.\n\nOn the terrace the tea-table dazzled the eye with its spotless linen,\nits blue Canton, and its bundle of pink roses. Hillard extended his cup\nfor a second filling, vaguely wondering where Merrihew was. They had\nthreshed continental politics, engineering, art and the relative crafts,\nprecious stones, astronomy and the applied sciences, music, horses, and\ngeology, with long pauses in between. Both knew instinctively that this\nlearned discourse was but a makeshift, a circuitous route past\ndanger-points. \"Have you ever heard of telling fortunes in tea-grounds?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Yes. It is a pleasant fallacy, and nothing ever comes true.\" And La\nSignorina vaguely wondered where Kitty was. She needed Kitty at this\nmoment, she who had never needed anybody.\n\nThe tramp of feet beyond the wall diverted them for a space. A troop of\nmarksmen from the range were returning cityward. They were dirty and\ntired, yet none seemed discontented with his lot. They passed in a haze\nof dust.\n\nThe man and woman resumed their chairs, and Hillard bent his head over\nthe cup and stared at the circling tea-grounds in the bottom. The\nmovement gave her the opportunity she desired: to look freely and\nwithout let at his shapely head. Day after day, serene and cloudless\nFlorentine days, this same scene or its like had been enacted. It took\nall her verbal skill to play this game safely; a hundred times she saw\nsomething in his eyes that warned her and armed her. When he passed that\nevening on horseback she knew that these things were to be. She had two\nbattles where he had only one; for she had herself to war against. Each\nnight after he had gone she fought with innocent desire; argument after\nargument she offered in defense. But these were all useless; she must\nsend him away. And yet, when he came, as she knew he would, she offered\nhim tea! And in rebellion she asked, Why not? What harm, what evil? Was\nit absolutely necessary that she should let all pleasure pass, thrust it\naside? The suffering she had known, would not that be sufficient penance\nfor this little sin? But on his side, was this being fair to him? This\nman loved her, and she knew it. Up to this time he had met her but\ntwice, and yet he loved her, incredible as it seemed. And though he\nnever spoke of this love with his lips, he was always speaking it with\nhis eyes; and she was always looking into his eyes.\n\nShe never looked into her own heart; wisely she never gave rein to\nself-analysis; she dared not. And so she drifted on, as in some sunny\ndream of remote end.\n\nHow inexplicable were the currents and cross-currents of life! She had\nmet a thousand men, handsomer, more brilliant; they had not awakened\nmore than normal interest. And yet this man, quiet, humorous, ordinarily\ngood-looking, aroused in her heart discord and penetrated the barriers\nto the guarded sentiment. Why? Always this query. Perhaps, after all, it\nwas simply the initial romance which made the impression so lasting. Ah,\nwell; to-morrow or the next day the end would come; so it did not\nmatter.\n\nThere was one bit of light in this labyrinth: Worth had spoken; that\ndisagreeable incident was closed. And this present dream, upon what reef\nwould it carry her? She shrugged. This action brought Hillard back to\nearth, for he, too, had been dreaming. He raised his head.\n\n\"Why did you do that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Shrug.\"\n\n\"Did I shrug? I did so unconsciously. Perhaps I was thinking of O'Mally\nand his flock of tourists.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it annoy you?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. It has been a fine comedy. I believe he is the most\naccomplished prevaricator I ever met. He remembers the lie of yesterday\nand keeps adding to it. I don't see how he manages to do it. He is\nbetter than Pietro. Pietro used to bring them into the house.\" She\ngathered up a handful of the roses and pressed them against her face,\nbreathing deeply.\n\nHillard trembled. She was so beautiful; the glow of the roses on her\ncheeks and throat, the sun in her hair, and the shadows in her eyes. To\nsmother the rush of words which were gathering at his lips, he raised\nhis cup and drank. Ten days! It was something. But the battle was\nwearing; the ceaseless struggle not to speak from his full heart was\nweakening him. Yet he knew that to speak was to banish the dream,\nhimself to be banished with it.\n\n\"If I were a poet, which I am not--\" He paused irresolutely.\n\n\"You would extemporize on the beauty of the perspective,\" she\nsupplemented. \"How the Duomo shines! And the towers, and the Arno--\"\n\n\"I was thinking of your hair,\" he interrupted. \"I have never seen\nanything quite like it. It isn't a wig, is it?\" jestingly.\n\n\"No, it is my own,\" with an answering smile.\n\n\"Ah, that night! It is true, as you said; it is impossible to forget the\ncharm of it.\"\n\nShe had recourse to the roses again. Dangerous ground.\n\n\"You have not told me the real reason why you sang under my window that\nnight.\"\n\n\"Have I not? Well, then, there can be no harm in telling you that. I had\njust signed the contract to sing with the American Comic Opera Company\nin Europe. I saw the world at my feet, for it would be false modesty to\ndeny that I have a voice. More disillusions! The world is _not_ at my\nfeet,\" lightly.\n\n\"But I am,\" he replied quietly.\n\nShe passed this declaration. \"I might have more successfully applied to\nthe grand opera in New York; but my ambition was to sing here first.\"\n\n\"But in comic opera?\"\n\n\"Another blunder, common of its kind to me. Have I not told you that I\nam always making missteps such as have no retracing?\"\n\n\"Will you answer a single question?\"\n\nShe stroked the roses.\n\n\"Will you?\"\n\n\"I can make no promise. Rather ask the question. If I see the wisdom of\nanswering it, I shall do so.\"\n\n\"Is there another man?\" He did not look at her but rather at her fingers\nembedded in the roses. Silence, which grew and lengthened.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked evenly, when she realized that the silence\nwas becoming too long.\n\n\"In Venice you told me that there was a barrier. I ask now if this\nbarrier be a man.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA wrinkle of pain passed over his heart. \"If you love him--\"\n\n\"Love him? No, no!... I had hoped you would not speak like this; I\nrelied upon your honor.\"\n\n\"Is it dishonorable for me to love you?\"\n\n\"No, but it is for me--to permit you to say so!\"\n\nHe could hear the birds twittering in the boughs of the oak. A lizard\npaused on the damp stone near-by. A bee hovered over the roses, twirled\na leaf impatiently, and buzzed its flight over the old wall. He was\nconscious of recognizing these sounds and these objects, but with the\nconsciousness of a man suddenly put down in an unknown country, in an\nunknown age, far away from all familiar things.\n\n\"I deplore the misfortune which crossed your path and mine again,\" she\nwent on relentlessly, as much to herself as to him. \"But I am something\nof a fatalist. We can not avoid what is to be.\"\n\nHe was pale, but not paler than she.\n\n\"I offer you nothing, Mr. Hillard, nothing; no promise, no hope,\nnothing. A few days longer, and we shall separate finally.\"\n\nShe was about to rise and ask him to excuse her and retire, when\nMerrihew and Kitty came into view. There was nothing now to do but wait.\nShe sought ease from the tenseness of the moment in sorting the roses.\nHillard stirred the cold dregs in his tea-cup. Cold dregs, indeed! The\nlight of the world was gone out.\n\nMerrihew's face was as broad and shining as the harvest moon. He came\nswinging down the path, Kitty's arm locked in his. And Kitty's face was\nrosy. Upon reaching the table Merrihew imitated the bow of an old-time\ncourtier.\n\n\"It is all over,\" he said, swallowing. \"Kitty has promised to marry me\nas soon as we land in America. I'm a lucky beggar!\"\n\n\"Yes, you are,\" said Hillard. \"Congratulations to both of you.\"\n\nLa Signorina took hold of Kitty's hands. This was a much-needed\ndiversion.\n\n\"Is it true, Kitty?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Kitty answered, with a stage courtesy. \"I have promised to\nmarry him, for there seemed no other way of getting rid of him.\"\n\nHillard forced a smile. \"It's a shame to change such a pretty name as\nyours, Miss Killigrew.\"\n\n\"I realize that,\" replied Kitty with affected sadness.\n\n\"Go to!\" laughed the happy groom-elect. \"Merrihew and Killigrew; there's\nnot enough difference to matter. And this very night I shall cable to\nAmerica.\"\n\n\"Cable to America?\" echoed a tri-chorus.\n\n\"Yes; to have a parson in the custom-shed when we land. I know Kitty,\nand I am not going to take any chances.\"\n\nThis caused real laughter. La Signorina relighted the tea-lamp, and\npresently they were all talking together, jesting and offering\nsuggestions. No matter how great the ache in the heart may be, there is\nalways some temporary surcease. Hillard was a man.\n\nThey laughed quietly as they saw O'Mally gravely conducting his charge\nto the gates. He returned with Smith. Both were solemn-visaged.\n\n\"Well, noble concierge?\" inquired La Signorina. \"Why, you look as if you\nwere the bearer of ill-tidings.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am,\" said O'Mally. He tossed his cap on the stones and sat\ndown with Smith on the iron bench. \"No, no tea, thank you. What I need\nis a glass, a whole glass, of good Irish whisky. This thing has been on\nmy mind since noon, but I concluded to wait rather than spoil the whole\nday. I should have known nothing about it if it hadn't been for old\nPietro.\"\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked Merrihew.\n\n\"Enough,\" said O'Mally laconically. He directed his next words to La\nSignorina. \"You are sure of this friend of yours, the princess?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered La Signorina, her astonishment increasing.\n\n\"She gave you the right authority?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" more and more astonished.\n\n\"Agreed that we could remain here as long as we pleased?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" impatiently.\n\n\"Well, before I swing the thunder, let me tell you something,\" said\nO'Mally. \"I was in Florence a few days ago. I made some inquiries.\"\n\n\"About my friend the princess?\"\n\n\"Yes. It was impertinent, I know. I interviewed four or five hotel\nconcierges. Only one of them ever heard of the name; and then it was an\nold prince, not a woman. This concierge directed me to another, but as\nhe spoke only Italian, we could not make things fit. But when I\nmentioned the princess' name, he shrugged and laughed, as if something\nhighly amusing had hit him.\"\n\n\"Go on, Mr. O'Mally; go on. This is interesting. Your doubt is not at\nall complimentary to me. The police have recognized my authority.\"\n\n\"And that's what feazes me. But the main thing is this: your princess\nhas played us all rather a shabby trick. In the letter you read to us in\nVenice she said that she had never visited this villa.\"\n\n\"Only in her youth,\" replied La Signorina, her brows drawing together in\na frown. \"But I know her so well; she is not in the habit of making\nmisstatements. To the point at once. What has happened to bring about\nall this pother?\"\n\n\"It is simply this: our little jig is up,\" responded O'Mally. \"Read\nthese and see for yourself.\" He gave to her a broad white envelope and a\nclipping from _La Nazione_ of the day before.\n\n[Illustration: \"Our little jig is up. Read these and see for yourself.\"]\n\nShe seized the clipping eagerly, but the eagerness died from her face\nquickly, leaving it pale and stony. The clipping fluttered unheeded from\nher fingers to the ground. Her gaze passed from one face to another, all\nthe while a horror growing in her eyes. Slowly she picked up the\nenvelope and drew out the card. Her eyes filled, but with tears of rage\nand despair.\n\n\"Tell me, what is it?\" cried Hillard, troubled, for his keen lover's\neyes saw these changes.\n\nIn answer she gave him the card. He read it. It _was_ rather a knock.\nNow, why should the Principessa di Monte Bianca take it into her head to\ngive a ball in the Villa Ariadne, Wednesday week, when she had loaned\nthe villa indefinitely to her friend, La Signorina?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTANGLES\n\n\nHillard passed the card to Merrihew, who presented it to Kitty. Smith\nhad already seen it. He waved it aside moodily. La Signorina's eyes\nroved, as in an effort to find some way out. Afar she discovered Worth,\nhis chin in his collar, his hands behind his back, his shoulders\nstudiously inclined, slowly pacing the graveled path which skirted the\nconservatory. From time to time he kicked a pebble, followed it and\nkicked it again, without purpose. Whether he saw them or not she could\nnot tell. Presently he turned the corner and was gone from sight. During\nthe past few days he had lived by himself; and for all that she did not\nlike him, she was sorry for him.\n\n\"It's a pretty kettle of fish,\" said O'Mally, rather pleased secretly in\nhaving created so dramatic a moment. \"She might have been kind enough,\nhowever, to notify us in advance of her intentions. I am still broke,\"\ndisheartened; \"and the Lord knows what I'll do if I'm shunted back into\nthe hands of the tender hotel managers and porters. There is nothing for\nus to do but to clear out, bag and baggage. It's a blamed hard world. I\nwish I had kept some of old Pietro's tips.\" He spoke with full\ndejection. Up to this time he had been playing the most enjoyable part\nin all his career, plenty to eat and to drink and no worry. And here the\naffair was ended with the suddenness of a thunder-clap.\n\n\"I'm even worse off than you are, Tom,\" said Smith. \"You've got a\ndiamond. The sooner we light out the better. In a day or two the\nprincess will be piling in upon us with her trunks and lackeys and\npoodles.\"\n\n\"Poodles!\" La Signorina was white with anger.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Smith innocently. \"Nearly all Italian ladies carry one\nor more of those woozy-eyed pups. Good-by to your sparkler, Tom, this\ntrip, if we ever expect to see the lights of old Broadway again.\"\n\nO'Mally sighed deeply. The blow had finally fallen.\n\nThen La Signorina rose to her feet. She took the card from Kitty's\nfingers, tore it into many pieces and flung them over the wall.\n\n\"We have been betrayed!\" she cried, a storm in her eyes.\n\n\"Betrayed?\"\n\nO'Mally looked at Smith; Hillard stared at Merrihew; Kitty regarded La\nSignorina with wonder.\n\n\"Betrayed? In what manner?\" asked Hillard.\n\n\"Her Highness has had no hand in this. I know. Some one with malice has\ndone this petty thing.\" To La Signorina everything had gone wrong\nto-day. \"I shall telegraph her Highness at once. I say that we have been\nmade the victims of some practical joke.\"\n\n\"Joke or not, we can't stay here now,\" Smith declared. \"All the high\nmuckamucks in and roundabout Florence will be getting out their jewels\nand gowns. If we send a denial to the paper, and we really have no\nauthority to do that, there'll be a whole raft of 'em who will not see\nit. And since nobody knows how many invitations have been sent out or to\nwhom they have been sent--oh, what's the use of all this arguing? The\nthing's done. No matter how we figure it, we're all railroaded.\nThird-class to Naples and twelve days in the steerage. Whew!\"\n\n\"I guess Hillard and I can help you,\" said Merrihew. \"We'll see that you\nget home all right.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" assented Hillard. Poor devils!\n\n\"We'll make good, once we strike Broadway,\" replied O'Mally gratefully.\n\nLa Signorina, her arms folded, her lips compressed into a thin line of\nscarlet, the anger in her eyes unabated, began to walk back and forth,\nand there was something tigerish in the light step and the quick turn.\nThe others, knowing her to be a woman of fertile invention, patiently\nand in silence waited for her to speak.\n\nBut the silence was broken unexpectedly by O'Mally. He gripped Smith by\nthe arm and pointed toward the path leading to the gates.\n\n\"Look!\" he whispered.\n\nAll turned, and what they saw in nowise relieved the tenseness of the\nsituation. Two _carabinieri_ and an inspector of seals, dusty but stern\nof countenance, came up the path. O'Mally, recollecting the vast prison\nat Naples, saw all sorts of dungeons, ankle-deep in sea-water, and iron\nbars, shackles and balls. Every one stood up and waited for this new\ndevelopment to unfold itself. La Signorina alone seemed indifferent to\nthis official cort\u00c3\u00a8ge. The inspector signed to the _carabinieri_, who\nstopped. He came on. Without touching his cap--a bad sign--he laid upon\nthe tea-table a card and a newspaper, familiar now to them all.\n\n\"Signora,\" he said politely but coldly to the whilom prima donna, \"will\nyou do me the honor to explain this? We have some doubts as to the\nauthority upon which this invitation was issued.\" He spoke fluent\nEnglish, for the benefit of all concerned.\n\nHillard waited for her answer, dreading he knew not what.\n\nShe spoke evenly, almost insolently. \"The invitation is perfectly\nregular.\"\n\nEverybody experienced a chill.\n\nThis time the inspector bowed. \"Then her Highness will occupy her\nvilla?\"\n\n\"She is already in possession. I am the Principessa di Monte Bianca,\"\ncalmly.\n\nHad an earthquake shattered the surrounding hills, and gulfs opened at\ntheir feet, it could not have spread terror more quickly among the\ntransient guests at the Villa Ariadne than this declaration. They were\nappalled; they stood like images, without the power to take their eyes\noff this woman. This transcendental folly simply paralyzed them. They\nknew that she was not the princess; and here, calmly and negligently,\nshe was jeoparding their liberty as well as her own. Mad, mad! For\nimposture of this caliber was a crime, punishable by long imprisonment;\nand Italy always contrived to rake in a dozen or so accomplices. They\nwere all lost indeed, unless they could escape and leave La Signorina\nalone to bear the brunt of her folly.\n\nThe keen-eyed inspector took mental note of these variant expressions.\n\n\"Your Highness,\" he said, his cap setting the dust on the stones flying,\n\"a thousand pardons for this disagreeable intrusion. It was not\nofficially known that your Highness was here.\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" replied the pseudo princess. \"Only I desired to remain\nincognito for the present.\"\n\n\"And the seals?\" purred the official.\n\n\"We shall go through that formality the morning after the ball. At\npresent I do not wish to be disturbed with the turning of the villa\nupside down, as would be the case were the seals removed.\"\n\n\"That will require the permission of the crown, your Highness.\"\n\n\"Then you will set about at once to secure this permission.\"\n\nThe air with which she delivered this command was noble enough for any\none. The inspector was overcome. \"But as your Highness has never before\noccupied the villa, some definite assurance--\"\n\n\"You will telegraph to Cranford and Baring, in the Corso Umberto Primo,\nRome. They will supply you with the necessary details and information.\"\n\nThe inspector inscribed the address in his notebook, bowed, backed away\nand bowed again. The crunch of the gravel under his feet was as a\nsinister thunder, and it was the only sound. He spoke to the\n_carabinieri_. They saluted, and the trio marched toward the gates.\n\nThere remained a tableau, picturesque but tense. Then Kitty began to cry\nsoftly.\n\n\"Are you mad?\" cried Hillard, his voice harsh and dry.\n\nLa Signorina laughed recklessly. \"If you call this madness.\"\n\n\"Smith, my boy,\" said O'Mally, moistening his lips, \"you and I this\nnight will pack up our little suit-cases and--_movimento, moto,\nviaggio_, or whatever the Dago word is for move on. I'm out of the game;\nthe stakes are too high. I pass, signorina.\"\n\n\"How could you do it?\" sobbed Kitty.\n\nMerrihew patted her hand and scowled.\n\n\"What an ado!\" said La Signorina, shrugging. \"So you all desert me?\"\n\n\"Desert you?\" O'Mally resumed his seat and carefully loosened the\ntopmost buttons of his coat. \"Of course we shall desert you. We are sane\nindividuals, at any rate. I have no desire to see the inside of an\nItalian jail, not knowing how to get out. What under the sun possessed\nyou? What excuse have you to offer for pushing us all into the lion's\nmouth? You could have easily denied all knowledge of the invitation,\nreferred them to your princess, wherever she may be, and we could have\ncleared out in the morning, poor but honest. And now you've gone and\ndone it!\"\n\nHillard leaned against a cypress, staring at the stones.\n\n\"In Venice,\" said she, her voice gentle, \"you accepted the chance\nreadily enough. What has changed you?\"\n\nO'Mally flushed. What she said was true. \"I was a fool in Venice,\"\nfrankly.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Smith?\" continued La Signorina, as with a lash.\n\nBut it was ineffectual. \"I was a fool, too,\" admitted Smith. \"In Venice\nit sounded like a good joke, but it looks different now.\" He sat down\nbeside O'Mally.\n\n\"So much for gallantry! And you, Kitty?\"\n\n\"I made a promise, and I'll keep it. But I think you are cruel and\nwicked.\"\n\n\"No nonsense, Kitty,\" interposed Merrihew. \"I've some rights now. You\nwill leave this villa to-night.\"\n\n\"I refuse,\" replied Kitty simply.\n\nHillard slipped into the pause.\n\n\"Did you issue those invitations yourself?\" he asked this strange,\nincomprehensible woman.\n\n\"Do you believe that?\" La Signorina demanded, with narrowing eyes.\n\n\"I don't know what to believe. But I repeat the question.\"\n\n\"On my word of honor, I know no more about this mystery than you do.\"\nAnd there was truth in her voice and eyes.\n\n\"But are you not over-sure of your princess? Being a woman, may she not\nhave changed her plans?\"\n\n\"Not without consulting me. I am not only sure,\" she added with a\npositiveness which brooked no further question, \"but to-morrow I shall\nprove to you that her Highness has not changed her plans. I shall send\nher a telegram at once, and you shall see the reply. But you, Mr.\nHillard, will you, too, desert me?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I am mad likewise,\" he said, with a smile on his lips\nbut none in his eyes. \"I'll see the farce to the end, even if that end\nis jail.\"\n\n\"If!\" cried O'Mally. \"You speak as though you had some doubt regarding\nthat possibility!\"\n\n\"So I have.\" Hillard went to the table, selected a rose, and drew it\nthrough the lapel of his coat.\n\n\"I say, Jack!\" Merrihew interposed, greatly perturbed.\n\n\"And you will stay also, Dan.\"\n\n\"Are you really in earnest?\" dubiously. Why hadn't this impossible woman\nsung under somebody else's window?\n\n\"Earnest as I possibly can be. Listen a moment. La Signorina is not a\nperson recklessly to endanger us. She has, apparently, put her head into\nthe lion's mouth. But perhaps this lion is particularly well trained. I\nam sure that she knows many things of which we are all ignorant. Trust\nher to carry out this imposture which now seems so wild. Besides, to\ntell the truth, I do not wish it said that I was outdone by Miss\nKilligrew in courage and the spirit of adventure.\"\n\n\"Oh, give me no credit for that,\" broke in Kitty.\n\nLa Signorina, however, rewarded Hillard with a look which set his pulses\nhumming. Into what folly would he not have gone at a sign from this\nlovely being? In his mind there was not the shadow of a doubt: this\ncomedy would ultimately end at some magistrate's desk. So be it.\n\nMerrihew cast about helplessly, but none held out a hand. He must decide\nfor himself.\n\n\"Do you mean it, Kitty?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nO'Mally's face wore several new wrinkles; and both he and Smith were\nlooking at the green mold on the flag-stones as interestedly as if China\nwas but on the other side. Kitty saw nothing, not even the hills she was\nstaring at.\n\n\"Since you have made up your mind, Jack,\" said Merrihew doggedly, \"why,\nthere's nothing for me to do but fall in. But it's kings against\ntwo-spots.\"\n\n\"Mental reservation?\" said the temptress. \"Mr. Hillard has none.\"\n\n\"I am not quite certain I have none,\" replied Hillard, renewing his\ninterest in the rose.\n\nA moment later, when he looked up, her glance plunged into his, but\nfound nothing. Hillard could fence with the eyes as well as with the\nfoils.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, finding that Hillard's mental reservations were not to\nbe voiced, \"here are three who will not desert me.\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" rejoined O'Mally; \"but it is different with\nthose two. Mr. Hillard's a millionaire, or near it, and he could buy his\nway through all the jails in Italy. Smith here, Worth and Miss Killigrew\nand myself, we have nothing. More than that, we're jotted down in the\npolice books, even to the mole on the side of my nose. There's no way\nout for us. We are accomplices.\"\n\n\"You will leave in the morning, then?\" asked La Signorina\ncontemptuously.\n\n\"I hope to.\"\n\n\"Want of courage?\"\n\n\"No. Against physical danger I am willing to offer myself at any time to\nyour Highness,\" with a touch of bitter irony. \"But to walk straight into\njail, with my eyes open, that's a horse of a different color.\"\n\n\"I like you none the less for your frankness, Mr. O'Mally. And I\napologize for doubting your courage. But if to-morrow I should produce a\ntelegram from her Highness that would do away with all your doubts?\"\n\n\"I'll answer that when I see the telegram.\" O'Mally made an unsuccessful\nattempt to roll a cigarette. This honeyed blarney, to his susceptible\nIrish blood, was far more dangerous than any taunts; but he remembered\nin time the fable of the fox and the crow. \"We have all been together\nnow for many weeks. Yet, who you are none of us knows.\"\n\n\"I am the princess,\" laughing.\n\n\"Oh, yes; of course; I forgot. But I mean your real name.\"\n\n\"My real name? Have you ever before asked me what it is?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we have been a little afraid of you,\" put in Smith.\n\nThe shadow of a smile lay upon her lips and vanished. \"My name is Sonia\nHilda Grosvenor.\" And her voice was music.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said O'Mally drolly, \"but were any of your\nancestors--er--troubled with insanity?\"\n\nThis query provoked a laughter which gave them all a sense of relief.\n\n\"My father had one attack of insanity, since you ask.\" La Signorina's\nface sobered. She stepped over to the wall, rested upon it, and searched\nthe deepening eastern horizon. Yes, her father had been insane, and all\nher present wretchedness was due to this insanity of a rational mind.\nFor a moment she forgot those about her, and her thought journeyed\nswiftly back to the old happy days. \"Yes, there is a species of insanity\nin my veins.\" She turned to them again. \"But it is the insanity of a\nsane person, the insanity of impulse and folly, of wilfulness and lack\nof foresight. As Mr. O'Mally said, I have gone and done it. What\npossessed me to say that I am the princess is as inexplicable to me as\nto you, though you may not believe it. But for me there is no\nwithdrawing now; flight would do us no good. We, or I, I should say,\nhave created a suspicion, and if we ran away we should be pursued from\none end of Italy to the other, till this suspicion was dissipated. We\nshould become suspects, and in Italy a suspect is liable to immediate\narrest. I am sorry that I have tangled you up in this. I release you all\nfrom any promise,\" proudly.\n\n\"If you talk like that--\" began O'Mally.\n\n\"Sh!\" Smith elbowed him sharply in the small ribs.\n\n\"It's all right, Smith. No one can force me into a scrape of this sort;\nbut when she speaks like that! Signorina, or I should say, Miss\nGrosvenor, you have the most beautiful voice in the world. Some day, and\nwe are all out of jail, I expect to hear you in the balcony scene with\nsome famous _tenore robusto_ as Romeo. You will be getting three\nthousand a week. You needn't bother about the telegram; but I'll have to\nhave a new suit,\" touching the frayed cuffs of his coat. \"Now, if we go\nto jail, how'll we get out?\"\n\n\"Trust me!\" La Signorina had recovered her gaiety.\n\n\"Well,\" said Smith, \"suppose we go and break the news to Worth?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHillard refused to canter, so the two walked their horses all the way\ninto Florence. Merrihew spoke but seldom and Hillard not at all. By now\nthe sun had gone down, and deep purple clouds swarmed across the blue\nface of heaven, forecasting a storm.... It was not dishonorable for him\nto love this woman, but it was not honorable for her to listen. Sonia\nHilda Grosvenor; that solved no corner of the puzzle.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" said Merrihew, \"I'm going to look up the jail and engage\nrooms ahead. It might be crowded.\"\n\nHillard raised his face and let a few drops of cooling rain patter on\nhis cheeks. \"I love her, I love her!\" he murmured.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE D\u00c3\u0089NOUEMENT\n\n\nThe morning sun poured over the hills, throwing huge shadows in the\ngorge below. The stream, swollen by the heavy rains of the past night,\nfoamed and snarled along its ragged bed. The air was fresh and cool, and\nthe stately cypresses took on a deeper shade of green. Lizards scampered\nover the damp stones about the porter's lodge or sought the patches of\ngolden sunshine, and insects busied themselves with the daily harvest.\nO'Mally sniffed. As the wind veered intermittently there came to him the\nperfume of the locust trees, now in full bloom, the flowers of which\nresembled miniature cascades hanging in mid-air. Pietro rocked, his legs\ncrossed, his face blurred in the drifting tobacco smoke.\n\n\"No more tourists, Pietro.\"\n\n\"No.\" Pietro sighed, a ruminating light in his faded eyes.\n\n\"Did you ever see La Signorina before? Do you know anything about her?\"\n\n\"Never! No!\" answered Pietro, with the perfect candor of an accomplished\nliar.\n\n\"Have you ever seen her Highness?\"\n\n\"When she so,\" indicating a height about two feet from the ground.\n\n\"You said that you had never seen her.\"\n\n\"Meestake.\"\n\n\"How old would she be?\"\n\nPietro wrinkled his brow, \"Oh, _quaranta, cinquanta_; fifty-forty. Who\nknows?\"\n\n\"Fifty! How old are you?\" suspiciously.\n\n\"_Settanta_; seventy.\"\n\n\"Well, you look it. But why hasn't the princess ever been here, when\nit's so beautiful?\"\n\n\"Woman.\"\n\n\"What woman?\"\n\n\"La Principessa. Many villas, much money.\"\n\nO'Mally kicked at one of the lizards. \"I thought she might be young.\"\n\n\"No. But La Signorina-bah! they ar-r-r-rest her. _Patienza!_\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\n\"But her friend the princess will come to her assistance.\"\n\nPietro laughed scornfully, which showed that he had some doubts.\n\n\"But you won't betray her?\"\n\n\"Never!\" puffing quickly.\n\n\"It's a bad business,\" admitted O'Mally. This old rascal of a gardener\nwas as hard to pump as a frozen well.\n\nPietro agreed that it was a bad business. \"Eenspector, he come to-day,\n_domani_--to-morrow. He come nex' day; watch, watch!\" Pietro elevated\nhis shoulders slowly and dropped them sharply. \"All ar-r-r-rest!\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"_Si._\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't betray her for money, Pietro?\"\n\n\"No!\" energetically.\n\nPietro might be loyal; still, O'Mally had some shadow of doubt.\n\n\"La Signorina is very beautiful,\" irrelevantly. \"Ah!\" with a gesture\ntoward the heavens. \"And if she isn't a princess, she ought to be one,\"\nslyly.\n\n\"_Zitto!_ She come!\" Pietro got up with alacrity, pocketing his pipe,\ncareful that the bowl was right side up.\n\nShe was as daintily fresh in her pink frock as a spring tulip; a frock,\nthought O'Mally, that would have passed successfully in any ball-room.\nShe was as beautiful as the moon, and to this bit of Persian O'Mally\nadded, conscious of a deep intake of breath, the stars and the farther\nworlds and the roses close at hand. Her eyes were shining, but her color\nwas thin. O'Mally, for all his buffoonery, was a keen one to read a\nface. She was highly strung. Where would they all land finally?\n\n\"I have been looking for you, Mr. O'Mally,\" she said.\n\n\"At your Highness' command!\"\n\nPietro, hearing this title, looked from one to the other suspiciously.\n\n\"I have just received a telegram from her Highness.\"\n\nAn expression of relief flitted over Pietro's withered countenance.\n\n\"It wasn't necessary,\" said O'Mally gallantly.\n\n\"But I wish you to read it. I know that you will cease to dream of\ndungeons and shackles.\" There was a bit of a laugh in her voice. It was\nreassuring.\n\n\"All right.\" O'Mally accepted the yellow sheet which the government\nfolds and pastes economically. There were fifty words or more. \"I can\nmake out a word or two,\" he said; \"it's in Italian. Will you read it for\nme?\"\n\n\"I forgot,\" apologetically.\n\nBriefly, La Principessa di Monte Bianca gave Sonia Hilda Grosvenor full\nauthority to act as her proxy in giving the ball; that in case of any\ndifficulty with the civil authorities to wire her at once and she would\ncome. As for the invitation, she knew absolutely nothing about it.\n\nThis last statement rather staggered the erstwhile concierge. If the\nprincess hadn't issued the invitation, who the deuce had? \"This leaves\nme confused, but it improves the scenery a whole lot. But who, then, has\ndone this thing?\"\n\n\"To solve that we must look nearer home.\"\n\n\"Have you any idea who did it?\" he inquired anxiously.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have you another invitation?\"\n\n\"I tore up the only one.\"\n\n\"That's too bad. A stationer's imprint might have helped us.\"\n\n\"I was angry and did not think. To-morrow a dozen temporary servants\nwill be added to the household. We shall be very busy.\"\n\n\"Before and after,\" said O'Mally dryly. He wondered what she on her part\nhad telegraphed the real princess. It was all very mystifying.\n\n\"Listen!\" she said.\n\n\"Horses,\" declared O'Mally.\n\n\"Two,\" said Pietro, with a hand to his ear.\n\nLa Signorina's color deepened.\n\n\"Our friends,\" laughed O'Mally; \"come up to see if we are still out of\njail.\"\n\nThe dreamy, pleasurable days at the Villa Ariadne were no more. The\nspirit of suspicion, of unrest, of doubt now stalked abroad, peering\nfrom veiled eyes, hovering on lips. And there was a coming and going of\nmenials, a to-and-froing of extra gardeners and carpenters, and the\nsound of many hammers. The ball-room and the dining-room were opened and\naired, the beautiful floors polished, and the dust and cobwebs of twenty\nyears were vanquished.\n\nIn Florence there was a deal of excitement over the coming affair, for\nthe Villa Ariadne had once been the scene of many a splendid\nentertainment. Men chatted about it in their caf\u00c3\u00a9s and the women\nchattered about it in their boudoirs. And there was here and there a\nmysterious smile, a knowing look, a shrug. There had always been a\nmystery regarding the Principessa di Monte Bianca; many doubted her\nactual existence. But the prince was known all over Europe as a handsome\nspendthrift. And the fact that at this precise moment he was quartered\nwith the eighth corps in Florence added largely to the zest of\nspeculation. Oh, the nobility and the military, which are one and the\nsame thing, would be present at the ball; they were altogether too\ninquisitive to decline.\n\nDaily the inspector of seals made his solemn round, poking into the\nforbidden chambers, into the lofts, into the cellars. He scrutinized\nevery chest and closet with all the provocative slowness of a\nphysiologist viewing under the microscope the corpuscles of some unhappy\nfrog. The information he had received from Rome had evidently quieted\nhis larger doubts; but these people, from the princess down to the\nimpossible concierge, were a new species to him, well worth watching. An\nAmerican princess; this accounted for much. He had even looked up the\ntwo Americans who rode up from Florence every day; but he found that\nthey were outside the pale of his suspicions; one of them was a\nmillionaire, known to the Italian ambassador in the United States; so he\ndismissed them as negligible quantities. He had some pretty conflicts\nwith Pietro; but Pietro was also a Tuscan, which explains why the\ninspector never obtained any usable information from this quarter.\n\nHillard and Merrihew eyed these noisy preparations broodingly. To the\none it was a damper to his rosal romance; to the other it was the\nbeginning of the end: this woman, so brilliant, so charming, so lovely\nand human, could never be his. Well, indeed, he understood now why Mrs.\nSandford had warned him; he understood now what the great mistake was.\nHad fate sent her under his window only for this? Bitterness charged his\nheart and often passed his lips. And this other man, who, what, and\nwhere was he all this time?\n\nHe was always at her heels now, saving her a care here, doing a service\nthere, but speaking no more of his love. She understood and was\ngrateful. Once she plucked a young rose and gave it to him, and he was\nsure that her hand touched his with pity, though she would not meet his\neyes. And so Merrihew found but little difficulty in picking up the\nthread of his romance.\n\nAs for O'Mally, he spent most of his leisure studying time-tables.\n\nAt four o'clock on the afternoon of the day before the ball, now that\nthe noise had subsided and the servants were in their quarters, La\nSignorina went into the gardens alone. An hour earlier she had seen\nHillard mount and ride away, the last time but once. There seemed to\nbear down upon her that oppression which one experiences in a nightmare,\nof being able to fly so high, to run madly and yet to move slowly,\nalways pursued by terror. Strive as she would, she could not throw off\nthis sense. After all, it was a nightmare, from the day she landed in\nNew York up to this very moment. But how to wake? Verily, she was mad.\nWould any sane person do what she had done and was yet about to do? She\nmight have lived quietly and peacefully till the end of her days. But\nno! And all her vows were like dried reeds in a tempest, broken and\nbeaten. Even now there was a single avenue of escape, but she knew that\nshe could not profit by it and leave these unfortunate derelicts to\nshift for themselves. It was not fair that they should be made to suffer\nfor her mad caprices. She must play it out boldly to the final line,\ncome evil or not.... Love! She laughed brokenly and struck her hands in\nsuppressed fury. A fitting climax, this! All the world was mad and she\nwas the maddest in it.\n\nSome one was coming along the path. She wheeled impatiently. She wanted\nto be alone. And of all men Worth was not the one she cared to see. But\nthe sight of his pale face and set jaws stayed the words she was\ninclined to speak. She waited restlessly.\n\n\"I realize that my presence may be distasteful to you,\" he began, not\nwithout some minor agitation. It was the first time in days that he had\nstood so near to her or had spoken while alone with her. \"But I have\nsomething to say to you upon which your future welfare largely depends.\"\n\n\"I believed that we had settled that.\"\n\n\"I am not making any declaration of love, madame,\" he said.\n\n\"I am listening.\" This prelude did not strike her favorably.\n\n\"There has been a tremendous wonder, as I understand, about this ball.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" guardedly.\n\n\"In regard to the strange manner in which the invitations were issued.\"\n\n\"Have you found out who did it?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Yes.\" The light in his eyes was feverish despite the pallor of his\nface.\n\n\"Who was it?\" fiercely. Oh, but she would have revenge for this\nmiserable jest!\n\n\"I issued those invitations--with a definite purpose.\"\n\n\"You?\" Her eyes grew wide and her lips parted.\n\n\"I!\" a set defiance in his tone.\n\n\"It is you who have done this thing?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am the guilty man. I did the work well, considering the\ndifficulties. The list was the main obstacle, but I overcame that. I\nrepresented myself as secretary to her Highness, which, when all is\nsaid, was the very thing agreed upon in Venice. I am the guilty man;\"\nbut he spoke like a man who was enjoying a triumph.\n\n\"And you have the effrontery to confess your crime to me?\" her fury\nblazing forth.\n\n\"Call it what you please, the fact remains.\"\n\n\"What purpose had you in mind when you did this cowardly thing? And I\nhad trusted you and treated you as an equal! And so it was you who\nperpetrated this forgery, this miserable jest?\"\n\n\"Forgery, yes; jest, no.\" Her anger did not alarm him; he had gone too\nfar to be alarmed at anything.\n\n\"Why did you do it?\"\n\n\"I did it as a man who has but a single throw left. One chance in a\nthousand; I took that chance and won.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you at all.\" She was tired.\n\n\"As I said, I had a definite purpose. An imposture like this is a prison\noffense. I asked you to marry me. I do so again.\"\n\n\"You are hiding a threat!\" The mental chaos cleared and left her thought\nkeen and cold.\n\n\"I shall hide it no longer. Marry me, or I shall disclose the imposture\nto the police.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" She shot him a glance, insolent and piercing. Then she laughed,\nbut neither hysterically nor mirthfully. It was the laughter of one in\ndeadly anger. \"I had believed you to be a man of some reason, Mr. Worth.\nDo you suppose, even had I entertained some sentiment toward you, that\nit would survive a circumstance like this?\"\n\n\"I am waiting for your answer.\"\n\n\"You shall have it. Why, this is scarcely on the level with cheap\nmelodrama. Threats? How short-sighted you have been! Did you dream that\nany woman could be won in this absurd fashion? You thought nothing of\nyour companions, either, or the trouble you were bringing about their\nheads.\"\n\n\"Yes or no?\" His voice was not so full of assurance as it had been.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Take care!\" advancing.\n\n\"I am perfectly capable of taking care. And heed what I have to say to\nyou, Mr. Worth. You will leave this villa at once; and if you do not go\nquietly, I shall order the servants to put you forth. That is my\nanswer.\"\n\n\"You speak as though you were the princess,\" he snarled.\n\n\"Till Thursday morning I _am_!\" La Signorina replied proudly.\n\n\"I shall inform the police.\"\n\n\"Do so. Now, as there is nothing more to be said, be gone!\"\n\nHe saw that he had thrown and lost; and a man who loses his last throw\nis generally desperate. Regardless of consequences, he seized her\nroughly in his arms. She struck him across the eyes with full strength,\nand she was no weakling. He gasped in pain and released her.\n\n\"If I were a man,\" she said quietly, but with lightning in her eyes,\n\"you should die for that!\" She left him.\n\nWorth, a hundred varied emotions rocking him, stared after her till she\nwas no longer in sight. There were tears in his eyes and a ringing in\nhis head. Fool! To play this kind of game against that kind of woman!\nFool, fool! He had written the end himself. It was all over. He went to\nhis room, got together his things, found a cart, and drove secretly into\nFlorence.\n\nOn the night of the ball there was a brilliant moon. Rosy Chinese\nlanterns stretched from tree to tree. The little god in the fountain\ngleamed with silver on one side and there was a glow as of life on the\nother. From the long casement windows, opened to the mild air of the\nnight, came the murmur of music. The orchestra was playing Strauss, the\ndreamy waltzes from _The Queen's Lace Handkerchief_. Bright uniforms and\nhandsome gowns flashed by the opened windows. Sometimes a vagrant puff\nof air would find its way in, and suddenly the ball-room dimmed and the\ndancers moved like phantoms. The flames of the candles would struggle\nand, with many a flicker, right themselves, and the radiant colors and\njewels would renew their luster.\n\nO'Mally, half hidden behind a tree, wondered if he had not fallen asleep\nover some tale by Scheherazade and was not dreaming this. But here was\nold Pietro standing close by. It was all real. At odd whiles he had a\nvision of Kitty in her simple white dress, of Merrihew's flushed face,\nof Hillard's frowning pallor, of La Signorina wholly in black, a rare\nnecklace round her white throat, a star of emeralds in her hair, her\nface calm and serene. Where would they all be on the morrow?\n\n\"Pietro, she is more than beautiful!\" sighed O'Mally.\n\n\"But wait,\" said Pietro. He alone among the men knew the cause of\nWorth's disappearance. \"Trouble.\"\n\nLeaning against the door which gave entrance to the ball-room from the\nhall were two officers, negligently interested in the moving picture.\n\"What do you make of it?\" asked one.\n\n\"Body of Bacchus, you have me there!\"\n\n\"Shall we go?\"\n\n\"No, no! The prince himself will be here at eleven. He was, singularly\nenough, not invited; and knowing the story as I do, I am curious to\nwitness the scene. The women are already picking her to pieces. To give\na ball in this hurried manner, without ladies in attendance! These\nAmericans! But she _is_ beautiful,\" with evident reluctance.\n\nHillard, peering gloomily over their shoulders, overheard. The prince!\nOh, this must not be. There could be only one prince in a matter of this\nkind. He pushed by the Italians without apology for his rudeness, edged\naround the ball-room till he reached La Signorina's side. He must save\nher at all hazards.\n\n\"A word,\" he whispered in German.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked in the same tongue.\n\n\"The prince himself will be here at eleven.\"\n\n\"What prince?\"\n\n\"Di Monte Bianca. Come, there is no time to lose. I have been holding my\ncarriage ready ever since I came. Come.\"\n\n\"Thank you, but it is too late.\" She smiled, but it was a tired and\nlonely little smile. \"Wait near me, but fear nothing.\" She had long\nsince armed her nerves against this moment.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Enough! Leave everything to me.\"\n\n\"In God's name, who and what are you that you show no alarm when such\ndanger threatens?\"\n\n\"I have told you to wait,\" she answered.\n\nHe stepped back, beaten, discouraged. He would wait, and woe to any who\ntouched her!\n\nAt precisely eleven the music ceased for intermission. There was a lull.\nTwo _carabinieri_ pushed their way into the ball-room. Tableau.\n\n\"Which among you is called the Principessa di Monte Bianca?\" was asked\nauthoritatively.\n\n\"I am she,\" said La Signorina, stepping forth.\n\nThe _carabinieri_ crossed quickly to her side.\n\n\"What do you wish?\" she asked distinctly.\n\n\"You are under arrest for imposture. You are not the Principessa di\nMonte Bianca; you are known as La Signorina, a singer.\"\n\nHillard, wild with despair, made as though to intervene.\n\n\"Remain where you are!\" he was warned.\n\nAs the _carabinieri_ were about to lay hands upon La Signorina, a loud\nvoice from the hall stopped them.\n\n\"One moment!\" An officer in riding breeches and dusty boots entered and\napproached the dramatic group. Hillard and Merrihew recognized him\ninstantly. It was the man with the scar. \"What is the trouble?\"\n\n\"This woman,\" explained one of the _carabinieri_, saluting respectfully,\n\"is posing as your wife, Highness. We are here to arrest her.\"\n\n\"Do not touch her!\" said the prince. \"She has the most perfect right in\nthe world to do what she has done. She _is_ the Principessa di Monte\nBianca, my wife!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nMEASURE FOR MEASURE\n\n\nSilence invested the Villa Ariadne; yet warm and mellow light illumined\nmany a window or marked short pathways on the blackness of the lawn. Of\nthe hundred lanterns hanging in the gardens, not a dozen still burned,\nand these offered rather a melancholy reminder of joy and laughter\ndeparted. The moon was high in the heavens now, and the shadows cast by\nthe gloomy cypresses put the little god in the fountain in complete\ndarkness. A single marble bench stood out with that vividness which only\nmarble and moonshine can produce. All the carriages, save one, were\ngone. A solitary saddle-horse rattled his bit, pawed restively, and\ntossed his head worriedly from side to side, as if prescience had\ntouched him with foretelling.\n\nOn the other side of the wall, lurking in the dark niches, was a tall,\nlean, grey-haired old man who watched and listened and waited. Whenever\nhe ventured into the moonlight the expression on his face was exultant\nbut sinister. He was watching and listening and waiting for the horse.\nAt the first sound of the animal's prancing hoofs on the stones by the\nporter's lodge, the old man was prepared to steal to the self-appointed\nplace somewhat down the road. What befell there would be wholly in the\nhands of God. Seven years! It was a long time. He had not hunted for\nthis man; he was breaking no promise; their paths had recrossed; it was\ndestiny. So he waited.\n\nWithin the ball-room the candles were sinking in their brass sconces and\nlittle waxen stalactites formed about the rims. The leaving of the\nguests had been hurried and noisy and without any particular formality\nor directness. In truth, it resembled a disorderly retreat more than\nanything else. The d\u00c3\u00a9nouement was evidently sufficient; they had no\ndesire to witness the anti-climax, however interesting and instructive\nit might be. _Carabinieri_ and tableaux and conjugal reunion; it was too\nmuch to be crowded all into one night. Good-by! During this flight his\nHighness the Principi di Monte Bianca, Enrico by name, had taken the\npart of an amused spectator; but now that the last of the unwelcome\nguests was gone, he assumed the role premeditated. He strode up and down\nthe floor, his spurs tinkling and his saber rattling harshly. He stopped\nbefore this painting or that, scrutinized the corners to ascertain what\nartist had signed it; he paused an interval before the marble faun,\nwhich he recognized as a genuine antique. These things really interested\nhim, for he had never been inside the Villa Ariadne till this night. And\nthere was an excellent reason. Occasionally he glanced at the group on\nthe opposite side of the room. He laughed silently. They were as lively\nas so many sticks of wood. Oh, he would enjoy himself to-night; he would\nextract every drop of pleasure from this rare and unexpected moment. Had\nshe been mad, he wondered, to give him out of hand this longed-for\nopportunity? A month longer and this scene would have been impossible.\nAt last he came to a stand in front of La Signorma, who was white and\nweary. The two had not yet exchanged a word.\n\n\"So,\" he said, \"after five years I find you, my beautiful wife!\" With\none hand hipping his saber and the other curling his mustaches, he\nsmiled at her. \"What a devil of a time you have given me! Across oceans\nand continents! A hundred times I have passed you without knowing it\ntill too late. And here, at the very moment when I believed it was all\nover, you fling yourself into the loving arms of your adoring husband! I\ndo not understand.\"\n\n\"Be brief,\" she replied, the chill of snows in her voice. Her hate for\nthis man had no empty corners. \"I have played foolishly into your hands.\nSay what you will and be gone.\"\n\n\"What a welcome!\"\n\n\"Be quick!\"\n\nThere was danger in her voice now, and he recognized the tense quality\nof it. \"I shall telegraph to the attorneys in Rome to partition the\nestates, my heart!\" mocking her. \"The king will not add to his private\npurse the riches of Colonel Grosvenor and the Principi di Monte Bianca,\nyour father and mine, old fools! To tell the truth, I am badly in need\nof money, and, head of Bacchus! your appearance here is life to me, my\ndear Sonia. Life! I am a rich man. But,\" with a sudden scowl, dropping\nthe mask of banter, \"I do not understand these companions of yours.\" He\neyed the group coldly. \"What position in my household does this\ngentleman occupy?\" indicating Hillard and smiling evilly.\n\n\"Give no heed,\" said La Signorina, as Hillard took a step forward.\n\n\"So it is all true, then?\" he asked despairingly. \"You are his wife?\"\n\n\"Yes. Forgive me, but did I not warn you many times? In the eyes of the\nItalian civil law I am this man's wife, but in the eyes of God and the\nChurch, never, never!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"In a few days I shall write you; in this letter I promise to explain\neverything. And you will forgive me, I know.\"\n\n\"Forgive you? For what? There is nothing to forgive on my side; the gift\nis on yours. For I have been a meddler, an unhappy one.\"\n\n\"Will you and Mr. Merrihew go now? I do not wish you two to witness this\nscene.\"\n\n\"Leave you alone with this wretch? No!\" said Hillard.\n\n\"Well?\" cried the prince impatiently. He was not inclined toward these\nconfidences between the American and his wife. \"I have asked a question\nand nobody replies. I inquire again, what position does he hold?\"\n\n\"This villa is mine,\" she answered, the sharpness of her tone giving\nhint to the volcano burning in her heart. \"However the estates may be\npartitioned, this will be mine. I command you to leave it at once, for\nyour presence here is as unwelcome to me as that of all creeping things.\nI find that I do not hate you; I loathe you.\"\n\nThe prince laughed. That she loathed or hated him touched him not in the\nquick. Love or hate from this woman who knew him for what he was, a\nsoulless scoundrel, was nothing. She was simply a sack of gold. But this\nwas his hour of triumph, and he proposed to make the most of it.\n\n\"I could have let the _carabinieri_ take you to prison,\" he said\nurbanely. \"A night in a damp cell would have chastened your spirit. But\nI preferred to settle this affair as quickly as possible. But this\nfriend of yours, he annoys me.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" returned Hillard. \"Your Highness has but to say the\nword and I will undertake the pleasure of relieving you of this man's\npresence.\"\n\n\"Be still,\" she said. \"Will you go?\" to the prince.\n\n\"Presently. First, I wish to add that your dear friend is both\nthick-skulled and cowardly. I offered to slap his face a few nights ago,\nbut he discreetly declined.\"\n\nHillard laughed shortly. He desired to get closer to this gentlemanly\nprince.\n\n\"For my sake!\" whispered La Signorina.\n\n\"I am calm,\" replied Hillard, gently releasing his arm from her grasp.\nHe approached the prince smiling, but there was murder and despair in\nhis heart. \"Had I known you that night, one of us would not be here\nnow.\"\n\n\"It is not too late,\" suggested the prince. \"Come, are you in love with\nmy wife?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe bluntness of this assertion rather staggered the prince. \"You admit\nit, then?\" his throat swelling with rage.\n\n\"There is no reason why I should deny it.\"\n\n\"She is your--\"\n\nBut the word died with a cough. Hillard, a wild joy in his heart, caught\nthe prince by the throat and jammed him back against the rose-satin\npanel, under a dripping candelabrum. The prince made a violent effort to\ndraw his sword, but Hillard seized his sword-arm and pinned it to the\npanel above his head. The prince was an athlete, but the man holding him\nwas at this moment made of iron. The struggling man threw out a leg\nafter the manner of French boxers, but his opponent met it with a knee.\nAgain and again the prince made desperate attempts to free himself. He\nwas soon falling in a bad way; he gasped, his lips grew blue and the\nwhites of his eyes bloodshot. This man was killing him! And so he was;\nfor Hillard, realizing that he had lost everything in the world worth\nliving for, was mad for killing.\n\n[Illustration: Again and again the prince made desperate attempts to\nfree himself]\n\nFor a time the others were incapable of action. Merrihew, Kitty, O'Mally\nand Smith were in the dark as to what had passed verbally; they could\nonly surmise. But here was something they all understood. La Signorina\nwas first to recover. She sprang toward the combatants and grasped\nHillard's hand, the one buried in the prince's throat, and pulled. She\nwas not strong enough.\n\n\"Merrihew, O'Mally, quick! He is killing him!\" she cried wildly.\n\nThe two, Merrihew and O'Mally, finally succeeded in separating the men,\nand none too soon. The prince staggered to a chair and sank heavily into\nit. A moment more and he had been a dead man. But he was not grateful to\nany one.\n\nLa Signorina turned upon Hillard. \"And you would have done this thing\nbefore my very eyes!\"\n\n\"I was mad,\" he panted, shamed. \"I love you better than anything else in\nGod's world, and this man means that I shall lose you.\"\n\n\"And you would have come to me across his blood?\" wrathfully.\n\n\"I was not thinking of that. The only thought I had was to kill him. God\nknows I'm sorry enough.\" And he was.\n\n\"Ah, what a night!\" She swayed and pressed her hand over her eyes. \"No,\ndo not touch me,\" she said. \"I am not the kind of woman who faints.\"\n\nThe prince lurched toward Hillard, but fortunately Merrihew heard the\nslithering sound of the saber as it left its scabbard. Kitty screamed\nand O'Mally shouted. Merrihew, with a desperate lunge, stopped the blow.\nHe received a rough cut over the knuckles, but he was not aware of this\ntill the excitement was past. He flung the saber at O'Mally's feet.\n\n\"You speak English,\" said Merrihew, in an ugly temper, half regretting\nthat he had interfered with Hillard. \"You may send your orderly to the\nHotel Italie to-morrow morning, and your saber will be given to him. You\nwill not carry it back to Florence to-night. Now, it is time to excuse\nyourself. We can get along without you nicely.\"\n\nThe prince tore at his mustaches. He would have put them all to the\nsword gladly. Meddlers! To return to Florence without his saber was\ndishonor. He cursed them all roundly, after the manner of certain\nhusbands, and turned to La Signorina.\n\n\"I am in the way here,\" he said, controlling his passion with\ndifficulty. \"But listen attentively to what I say: you shall remain my\nwife so long as both of us live. I had intended arranging your freedom,\nonce the estate and moneys were divided, but not now. You shall read my\nwife till the end of the book; for unless I meet you half-way, the\nmarriage contract can not be broken. In the old days it was your\nconscience. The still small voice seems no longer to trouble you,\"\nturning suggestively to Hillard. \"You are stopping at the Hotel Italie?\"\n\n\"I am. You will find me there,\" returned Hillard, with good\nunderstanding.\n\n\"Good! Your Highness, to-morrow night I shall have the extreme pleasure\nof running your lover through the throat.\" He picked up his cap, which\nlay on one of the chairs, put it on cavalierly, and took his princely\npresence out of their immediate vicinity.\n\n\"It will do my soul good to stand before that scoundrel,\" said Hillard,\nstretching out his hands and closing them with crushing force. \"He has\nfelt the power of my hand to-night. I will kill him.\"\n\nLa Signorina laid a hand on his arm. \"No, Mr. Hillard, you will fight no\nduel.\"\n\n\"And why not? I do not see how it can be avoided.\"\n\n\"You have told me that you love me. As it stands I may sometimes see\nyou, but if you kill him, never.\"\n\n\"He is far more likely to kill me,\" said Hillard morosely. \"And perhaps\nit would be a kind service.\"\n\n\"Shame!\" she cried. \"Have you no courage? Can you not accept the\ninevitable manfully? Think of me. I can fight no duels; I must live on\nand on, tied legally to this man. And it is you who will add misery to\nmy unhappiness? You will not fight him,\" with the assurance of one who\nhas offered a complete argument.\n\n\"Very well. To be called a coward by a man like that is nothing. I shall\nnot fight him.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" And she gave him her hand impulsively.\n\n\"I love you,\" he murmured as he bent to kiss the hand; \"and it is not\ndishonorable for you to hear me say so.\"\n\n\"I forbid you to say that!\" But the longing of the world was in her eyes\nas she looked down at his head. She released her hand. \"My friends,\nto-morrow our little play comes to an end. This is no longer Eden. We\nmust go.\"\n\n\"This is what comes of American girls marrying these blamed foreigners,\"\ngrowled the tender-hearted O'Mally. \"Why did you do it?\"\n\n\"I am almost Italian, Mr. O'Mally. I had no choice in the matter; the\naffair was prearranged by our parents, after the continental fashion.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I spoke like that,\" O'Mally said contritely.\n\n\"No apologies, if you please. It is only just that you should know\nsomething of the case, considering the manner in which I imposed upon\nyou all.\"\n\n\"I'll punch Worth's head when I run across him.\" O'Mally clenched his\nfists.\n\n\"That would change nothing. He was a part of destiny; he has served his\nlittle turn and has gone. Were we not a happy family together for\nweeks?\" La Signorina smiled wanly. \"To-morrow I am going to write Mr.\nHillard; I am going to tell him the story. From your point of view you\nmay write me down a silly fool, but one's angle of vision is not\nimmutable.\"\n\n\"You're the finest woman in the world,\" declared O'Mally; \"and whatever\nyou have done has been right, I know.\"\n\nThen Kitty ran up to La Signorina and embraced her; and the eyes of both\nof them swam in tears.\n\n\"You will be happy, at any rate, Kitty.\"\n\n\"Poor girl!\" cried Kitty. Princesses were mortal like other people. \"How\nI love you! Come back with us to America.\"\n\n\"I must live out the puzzle over here.\"\n\nWhen Hillard and La Signorina were at length alone, he asked: \"When\nshall I see you again?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Some day, perhaps, when time has softened the sharp edges of\nthis moment, the second bitterest I have ever known. To-morrow I shall\nwrite, or very soon. Now, give me your promise that you will no more\nseek me till I send for you.\"\n\n\"You will send for me?\" with eagerness and hope.\n\n\"Why not?\" proudly. \"There is nothing wrong in our friendship, and I\nprize it. Promise.\"\n\n\"I promise. Good-by! If I remain any longer I shall be making mad,\nregrettable proposals. For a little while I have lived in paradise.\nWherever I may be, at the world's end, you have but to call me; in a\nmonth, in a year, a decade, I shall come. Good-by!\" Without looking at\nher again, he rushed away.\n\nShe remained standing there as motionless as a statue. It seemed to her\nthat all animation was suspended, and that she could not have moved if\nshe had tried. By and by she gazed round the room, fast dimming; at the\nguttering candles, at the empty chairs, at the vacant doors and hollow\nwindows.... He had not asked her if she loved him, and that was well.\nBut there was not at that moment in all the length and breadth of Italy\na lonelier woman than her Highness the Principessa di Monte Bianca.\n\nMeanwhile the prince, raging and out of joint with the world, mounted\nhis horse. He would have revenge for this empty scabbard, or he would\nresign his commission. His throat still ached and pointed lights danced\nbefore his eyes. Eh, well! This time to-morrow night the American should\npay dearly for it. His short laugh had an ugly sound. This American was\njust the kind of chivalric fool to accept a challenge. But could he\nhandle foils? Could he fight? Could any of these damned American\nheretics fight, save with their fists? It was the other man's lookout,\nnot his. He put the duel out of his mind as a thing accomplished.\nShortly he would have compensation commensurate for all these five\nyears' chagrin. To elude him all this time, to laugh in his face, to\ndefy him, and then to step deliberately into his power! He never could\nunderstand this woman. The little prude! But for her fool's conscience\nhe would not have been riding the beggar's horse to-day. She was now too\nself-reliant, too intelligent, too cunning; she was her father over\nagain, soldier and diplomat. Well, the mystery of her actions remained,\nbut he was no longer the broken noble. So why should he puzzle over the\nwhys and wherefores of her motives? Ah! and would he not dig his hands\ndeep into the dusty sacks of gold and silver? Life again, such as he\ncraved; good cigars and good wine and pretty women who were no ardent\nfollowers of Minerva. To jam part of this money down the throats of his\nyelping creditors, to tear up his paper and fling it into the faces of\nthe greedy Jews! Ha, this would be to live! Paris, or Vienna, or London,\nwhere he willed; for what hold had the army now?\n\nHe was an expert horseman, but, like all Italians, he was by nature\ncruel. As he passed the gates the horse slid and stumbled to his knees;\nhe was up instantly, only to receive a hard stroke between the ears.\nThis unexpected treatment caused the animal to rear and waltz. This was\nnot the stolid-going campaign mount, but his best Irish hunter, on which\nhe had won prizes in many a gymkhana. There was a brief struggle, during\nwhich the man became master both of himself and the horse. They were\njust passing the confines of the villa when a man darted out suddenly\nfrom the shadows and seized the bridle.\n\n\"At last, my prince!\"\n\n\"Giovanni?\"\n\nInstinctively the prince reached for his saber, knowing that he had need\nof it, but the scabbard was empty. He cursed the folly which had made\nhim lose it. This encounter promised to be a bad one. What mouth of hell\nhad opened to cast this beggar, of all men, in his path? Oddly enough\nhis thought ran swiftly back to the little _casa_ in the Sabine\nHills.... Bah! Full of courage, knowing that one or the other would not\nleave this spot alive, he struck his horse with purpose this time, to\nrun his man down. But Giovanni did not lose his hold; hate and the\nnearness of revenge made him strong.\n\n\"No, no!\" he laughed. \"She is dead, my prince. And I, I was not going to\nseek _you_; I was going to let hell claim you in its own time. But you\nrode by me to-night. This is the end.\"\n\n\"Let go, fool!\" roared the prince, slashing Giovanni across the face\nwith the heavy crop.\n\nGiovanni laughed again and drew his knife. \"I shall not miss you this\ntime!\"\n\nThe prince, a trained soldier, shifted the reins to his teeth, buried\nhis knees in the barrel of the horse, unhooked his scabbard and swung it\naloft, deftly catching the reins again in his left hand. But Giovanni\nwas fully prepared. He released the bridle, his arm went back and the\nknife spun through the air. Yet in that instant in which Giovanni's arm\nwas poised for the cast, the prince lifted his horse on its haunches.\nThe knife gashed the animal deeply in the neck. Still on its haunches it\nbacked, wild with the unaccustomed pain. The lip of the road, at this\nspot rotten and unprotected, gave way. The prince saw the danger and\ntried to urge the horse forward. It was too late. The hind-quarters\nsank, the horse whinnied in terror, and the prince tried in vain to slip\nfrom the saddle. There came a grating crash, a muffled cry, and horse\nand rider went pounding down the rock-bound gorge.\n\nGiovanni listened. He heard the light, metallic clatter of the empty\nscabbard as it struck projecting boulders; he heard it strangely above\nthe duller, heavier sound. Then the hush of silence out of which came\nthe faint mutter of the stream. Giovanni trembled and the sweat on his\nbody grew cold: less from reaction than from the thought that actual\nmurder had been snatched from his hands. For several minutes he waited,\ndreading, but there was no further sound. He searched mechanically for\nhis knife, recovered it, and then crept down the abrupt side of the\ngorge till he found them. They were both dead. A cloud swept over the\nbenign moon.\n\n\"Holy Father, thou hast waited seven years too long!\" Giovanni crossed\nhimself.\n\nHe gazed up at the ledge where the tragedy had begun. The cloud passed\nand revealed the shining muskets of two _carabinieri_, doubtless\nattracted by the untoward sounds. Giovanni, agile and muscular as a\nwolf, stole over the stream and disappeared into the blackness beyond.\nBut there was an expression of horror on his face which could not have\nbeen intensified had Dante and Vergil and all the shades of the Inferno\ntrooped at his heels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nFREE\n\n\nIt was Merrihew who woke the sleeping cabby, pushed Hillard into a seat,\nand gave the final orders which were to take them out of the Villa\nAriadne for ever. He was genuinely moved over the visible misery of his\nfriend. He readily believed that Hillard's hurt was of the incurable\nkind, and so long as memory lasted the full stab of the pain would\nrecur. So to get him away from the scene at once was the best possible\nthing he could do. Merrihew noticed the little group of men collected at\nthe edge of the road, but he was too deeply absorbed in his own affairs\nto stop and make inquiries. The principal thing was to reach Florence\nwithout delay. He smoked two cigars and offered scarcely a dozen words\nto Hillard. When they arrived at the white hotel in the Borgognissanti\nand the night watchman drew the great bolts to admit them, Merrihew was\nglad. And all this to evolve from an unknown woman singing under\nHillard's window but six months ago! And a princess! Truly the world was\nfull of surprises.\n\nHe went to bed, advising Hillard to do the same. Mental repose was\nneeded before they could sit down and discuss the affair rationally.\n\nAt nine in the morning Hillard heard a fist banging on the panels of the\ndoor.\n\n\"Open, Jack; hurry!\" cried Merrihew outside. There was great agitation\nin his voice.\n\nHillard opened the door. \"What's the trouble, Dan?\" he asked.\n\nMerrihew closed the door and whispered: \"Dead!\" As the light from the\nwindow fell upon his face it disclosed pale cheeks and widely opened\neyes.\n\n\"Who?\" Hillard's heart contracted. \"In God's name, who?\"\n\n\"The prince. They found him and his horse at the bottom of the gorge.\nThere was a broken place in the road, and over this they had gone. The\nconcierge says that there has been foul play. Tracks in the dust, a\nstrange cut in the neck of the horse, and a scabbard minus its saber.\nNow, what the devil shall I do with the blamed sword?\"\n\nDead! Hillard sat down on the edge of the bed. Dead! Then she was free,\nfree.\n\n\"What shall I do with it?\" demanded Merrihew a second time.\n\n\"The sword? You really brought it?\"\n\n\"Yes. And if they find us with it--\"\n\n\"Put it in the bottom of the trunk and leave it there till you land in\nNew York. But the prince dead? You are sure?\"\n\n\"All Florence is ringing with the story of the ball, the wind-up, and\nthe tragedy. He's dead, no doubt of it. Shall we go up to the villa this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"No, Dan;\" but all the weariness went out of Hillard's eyes.\n\nAnd then Merrihew noticed. Hillard still wore his evening clothes and\nthe bed was untouched.\n\n\"That's very foolish.\"\n\n\"Why? I couldn't have closed my eyes,\" replied Hillard.\n\n\"But won't she need you up there?\" Merrihew was obviously troubled.\n\n\"If she needs me she'll send for me. But I am not needed, and she will\nnot send for me. I shall remain here and wait.\"\n\n\"He's dead. Things work out queerly, don't they?\"\n\n\"She is free. Thank God!\"\n\n\"You are not sorry, are you?\"\n\n\"Sorry? In a way, yes. He was a blackleg, but it isn't pleasant to\ncontemplate the manner of his end.\"\n\n\"Well, I can frankly say that there's no such sentiment on my side. He'd\nhave cut you down if I hadn't stopped him,\" said Merrihew, rubbing his\nswollen knuckles.\n\n\"It was measure for measure: I should have killed him had not you and\nO'Mally interfered.\"\n\n\"That's true. But what's back of all this muddle? Why was she\nmasquerading as an opera singer, when fortune and place were under her\nhand?\"\n\n\"She has promised to write.\"\n\n\"By George!\"\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n\"Didn't Giovanni tell us that he had friends in Fiesole, and that he was\ngoing to visit them?\"\n\n\"Giovanni? I had forgotten. But what had my old valet against the\nprince?\"\n\n\"Giovanni had a daughter,\" said Merrihew. \"His knife left a scar on the\nman. The prince carried a long scar on his cheek. Two and two make\nfour.\"\n\n\"But Giovanni had promised us.\"\n\n\"If this man did not cross his path. It looks as if he did.\"\n\nHillard had nothing to offer. He simply began dressing in his\nday-clothes, stopping at times and frowning at the walls. Merrihew\nwisely refrained from adding any questions. He was human; he knew that\nsomewhere in Hillard's breast the fires of hope burned anew.\n\nThe day passed without additional news. But at night the last of the\nAmerican Comic Opera Company straggled into the hotel, plus various\npieces of luggage. O'Mally, verbose as ever, did all the talking and\nvending of news.\n\n\"You wouldn't know her,\" he said, referring to La Signorina--for they\nwould always call her that. \"When she heard of that duffer's death I\nswear that she believed you had a hand in it. But when she heard that\nthe accident had occurred before you left the villa, she just collapsed.\nOh, there was a devil of a mess; police agents, _carabinieri_,\ninspectors. It was a good thing that there were plenty of witnesses to\nprove that the prince had called La Signorina his wife, or she would be\nin jail this night, and we along with her. The police were hunting for\nthe missing saber. Of course we knew nothing about it,\" with a wink at\nMerrihew. \"I don't know what would have happened if her lawyer hadn't\nhurried up from Rome and straightened out things. Queer business. But\nshe's a princess, all right; and she doesn't need any foreign handle,\neither. Kitty, you stick to America when you think of getting married.\"\n\n\"I shall,\" said Kitty demurely.\n\n\"My opinion,\" went on O'Mally, \"is that the prince beat his nag out of\npure deviltry, and the brute jumped into the gorge with him. The\n_carabinieri_ claim that they saw a man in the gorge. They gave chase,\nbut couldn't find hide nor hair of him.\"\n\nMerrihew looked significantly at Hillard, who signed to him to be\nsilent.\n\n\"I am glad that we can sail Saturday,\" said Kitty. She was very tired.\n\n\"So am I,\" echoed Smith. \"All I want is a heart-to-heart talk with old\nBroadway. Never again for mine!\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said O'Mally. \"You'll be talking about this for the next ten\nyears.\"\n\n\"As to that I don't say. But never my name on a foreign contract again,\nunless it takes me to London. No more _parle Italiano_. Let's go over to\nthe Grand. There's an American barkeep over there, and he'll sympathize\nwith us.\"\n\n\"You're on!\" said O'Mally willingly.\n\nWhen they were gone, Hillard asked Kitty if she had any news.\n\n\"She said that she would write you, and for you to remain here till you\nreceived the letter.\"\n\n\"Was that all?\"\n\n\"Yes. Have you seen anything of that wretched man Worth, who is the\ncause of all this trouble?\"\n\n\"No, nor do I care to.\"\n\n\"Suppose the three of us take a stroll along the Lungarno?\" suggested\nMerrihew. \"It will be the last chance together.\"\n\n\"You two go. I am worn out,\" said Hillard. \"I had no sleep last night.\"\n\nSo Kitty and Merrihew went out together. They climbed the Ponte Vecchio,\nleaned against the rail back of the bust of Cellini and contemplated the\ntrembling lights on the sluggish waters.\n\n\"I hate to leave him alone,\" said Merrihew.\n\nKitty nestled snugly against his arm. \"Don't worry about him. It is all\nwell with him.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I am a woman.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" A bell crashed out across the river; it was nine o'clock. \"Do you\nlove me, Kitty Killigrew?\"\n\n\"Very much, Mr. Merrihew.\"\n\n\"But why did you keep me waiting so long?\"\n\n\"That's one of the few secrets I shall never tell you.\"\n\nMerrihew pursued his investigations no further. \"We shall have to live\nin a flat.\"\n\n\"I should be happy in a hut. What an adventure we have had! I regret\nnone of it.\"\n\n\"Neither do I.\" And then, sure of the shadow and the propitiousness of\nthe moment, he kissed her. Kitty would never have forgiven him if he\nhadn't. \"I've bought you a cricket to take home.\"\n\n\"A cricket?\"\n\n\"Yes. These Florentines consider crickets very lucky, that is, the first\nyou find in May. You put him in a little wire cage and feed him lettuce,\nand if he sings, why, there's no doubt about the good luck. Funny little\ncodger! Looks like a parson in a frockcoat and an old-fashioned stock.\"\n\n\"Good luck always,\" said Kitty, brushing his hand with her lips.\n\nThey were gone, and Hillard was alone. He missed them all sorely,\nMerrihew with his cheery laugh, Kitty with her bright eyes, and O'Mally\nwith his harmless drolleries. And no letter. It would not be true to say\nthat he waited patiently, that he was resigned; he waited because he\nmust wait. There had been a great shock, and she required time to\nrecover her poise. Was there a woman in all the world like her? No. She\nwas well worth waiting for. And so he would wait. She was free now; but\nwould that really matter? There was no barrier; but could she love him?\nAnd might not her letter, when it did come, be a valedictory?\n\nDaily he searched the newspapers for news of Giovanni; but to all\nappearances Giovanni had vanished, as indeed he had, for ever out of\nHillard's sight and knowledge.\n\nThe letter came one week after the departure of his friends. It was\npost-marked Venice. And the riddle was solved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nTHE LETTER\n\n\nShall I say that I am sorry? No. I am not a hypocrite. Death in all\nforms is horrible, and I shudder and regret, but I am not sorry. Does it\nsound cruel and heartless to express my feelings thus frankly? Well, I\nam human; I do not pose as being better than I am. I have suffered a\ngrievous wrong. At the hands of this man I lost my illusions, I learned\nthe words hate and loathing, shame and despair. Again I say that I\nregret the violence of his end, but I am not sorry to be free. If we\nwait long enough the scales of Heaven will balance nicely. Some outraged\nfather or brother, to this alone do I attribute his death.\n\nLet me be as brief as possible; I have no desire to weary you, only the\nwish to vindicate in part what appeared to you as a species of madness.\n\nMy father was Colonel Grosvenor, of the Confederate army, during the\nCivil War. On General Lee's staff was an Italian named the Principi di\nMonte Bianca. He was an Arab for wandering. The tumult of battle would\nbring him round the world. Rich, titled, a real noble, he was at heart\nan adventurer, a word greatly abused these inglorious days. For does not\nthe word adventurer stand for the pioneer, the explorer, the inventor,\nthe soldier and the sailor? It is wrong to apply the word to the\nimpostor. My father was cut from the same pattern, a wild and reckless\nspirit in those crowded times. The two became friends such as you and\nMr. Merrihew are. Their exploits became famous. My father was also rich\nand a man of foresight. He knew that the stars and bars was a flag of\ntemporary endurance. All that portion of his wealth which remained in\nthe South he readily sacrificed with his blood. His real wealth was in\nforeign securities, mines, oils, steel, steamships. When the war\nterminated, the prince prevailed upon my father to return with him to\nItaly. Italy was not new to my father; and as he loved the country and\nspoke the language, he finally consented. He saw the shadow of the\nreconstruction and dreaded it; and there were no ties of blood to hold\nhim in the States. Italy itself was in turmoil. _Il Re Galantuomo_, that\nPiedmontese hunter, Vittorio Emanuele, wished to liberate Venice from\nthe grasp of Austria, to wrest temporal power from the Vatican, and to\nsend the French troops back to France. Well, he accomplished all these\nthings, and both my father and the prince were with him up to the time\nhe entered the Quirinal. After victory, peace. My father invested in\nvillas and palaces, added to his fortune through real estate in Rome,\nlived in Florence a little while, and settled down to end his days in\nthe Venetian palace on the Grand Canal. He and the prince met daily at\nFlorian's and planned futures or dreamed over the noisy past.\n\nThen my father, still young, remember, fell in love with the daughter of\na Venetian noble. It was a happy union. Shortly after the prince also\nmarried. He was, with the exception of my father, the most lovable man I\never knew. Brave, kindly, impetuous, honorable, witty and wise; it does\nnot seem possible that such a father should have such a son. Though he\ncovered it up with all the rare tact of a man of the world, his marital\nties were not happy like my father's.\n\nThere came a great day: a young prince was born, and the rough king\nstood as his god-father. Later I added my feeble protest, at the cost of\nmy mother's life. These domestic histories! how far more vital to the\nwelfare of nations than the flaming pages of war and politics! As I grew\nup I became my father's constant companion; we were always out of doors.\nBy and by he sent me to America to school; for he still loved his\ncountry and was not that fault-finding scold, the expatriate. And I may\nas well add that your defense of America pleased me as few things have\nin these later years. I returned from America to enter a convent out of\nRome. From there I went to Milan and studied music under the masters. My\nfather believed in letting youth choose what it would. Music! What\nshould I have done without it in the dark hours?\n\nOne fatal day the old prince and my father put their heads together and\ndetermined that this great friendship of theirs should be perpetuated;\nthe young prince should marry the young signorina. When will parents\nlearn not to meddle with the destinies of their children? So they\nproceeded to make the alliance an absolute certainty. They drew up the\nstrangest of wills. Both men were in full control of their properties;\nthere was no entailed estate such as one finds in England. They could do\nas they pleased; and this was before Italy had passed the law requiring\nthat no art treasures should be sold or transported. Fortunately for me,\nmy mother's property was considerable.\n\nThe impossible clauses in the joint will read that if we two young\npeople declined the bargain the bulk of the estates should revert to the\ncrown; again, if we married and separated and were not reunited inside\nof five years, the fortunes should become the crown's; if, having\nseparated from my husband, either for just or unjust reasons, I should\nsecretly or publicly occupy any villa or palace mentioned in the will,\nit would be a tacit admission that I accepted my husband. Was there ever\nsuch an insane tangle kindly meant? We must marry, we must be happy;\nthat our minds and hearts were totally different did not matter at all.\nDo you understand why I went from city to city, living haphazard?\nSometimes I was very poor, for my income from my mother's estate was\npaid quarterly, and I did not inherit my father's business ability.\nDuring the recent days in Venice I had to offer my jewels because I\ndared not write my attorneys for an advance, for I did not wish them to\nknow where I was.\n\nTime went on. How young I was in those days! What dreams I dreamed! The\nold prince died suddenly, his wife followed. And then my kind and loving\nfather went the way. I was very, very lonely. But I was taken under the\nwing of a duchessa who was popular at court. At this period the young\nprince was one of the handsomest men in Europe. Foolish women set about\nto turn his head. He was brave, clever and engaging. Dissipation had not\nyet enmeshed him. My heart fluttered naturally when I saw him, for he\nwas permitted to see me at intervals. Young girls have dreams which in\nolder years appear ordinary enough. He was then to me Prince Charming. I\nwas really glad that I was to marry him.\n\nOn completing my education I decided to live in Rome, where the prince\nwas quartered. I went into the world with serene confidence, believing\nthat all men were good like my father and his friend. The old duchessa\nmothered the rich American girl gladly; for, though I was half Italian,\nthey always considered me as the child of my father. I was presented at\ncourt, I was asked to dinners and receptions and balls. I was quite the\nrage because the dowager queen gave me singular attention. My head was\nin a whirl. In Europe, as you know, till a woman is married she is a\nnonentity. I was beginning to live. The older women were so attentive\nand the men so gallant that I lost sight of the things that counted. As\nI was a fluent linguist, and as I possessed a natural lightness of\nheart, my popularity was by no means due to my property. I believe I\nsang wherever I went, because I loved music, because it was beautiful to\nsend one's voice across space in confidence; it was like liberating the\nsoul for a moment.\n\nThe prince by this time seemed changed in some way; but I was blindly\nyoung. A girl of twenty in European society knows less than a girl of\nfifteen in the States. Often I noticed the long scar on his cheek. He\nhad received it, he said, in some cavalry exercise. As the Italians are\nreckless horsemen, I accepted this explanation without question. I know\ndifferently now! But he was as courteous and gallant to me as ever.\n\nNow, there was another clause in this will. It was the one thing which\nmade the present life tolerable and possible to me. We were to be\nmarried without pomp, quietly, first at the magistrate's and then at the\nchurch.\n\nHave you not often seen the carriage pass you in the streets? The bride\nin her white dress and veil and the bouquet of roses? The ribbon round\nthe driver's whip? The good-natured smiles of the idlers, the children\nrunning out and crying for a rose? They say that a rose given by the\nbride brings luck. It was thus we passed through the streets to the\nmagistrate's. I did not know then that I was not in love, that I was\nonly young and curious. I threw roses to any who asked. The prince sat\nbeside me in full-dress uniform, looking very handsome and\ndistinguished. We heard many compliments. The prince smiled, but he was\nnervous and not at ease. I thought nothing of this at the time. I\nbelieved his nervousness a part of my own. To be sure there was a fair\ngathering at the magistrate's, for the name of Monte Bianca was widely\nknown. But there was none of our own class present; they would be at the\nchurch.\n\nThe magistrate performed his part in the affair. Legally we were man and\nwife. We were leaving for the church, when at the very doorway a\nhandsome woman, sad-eyed, weary, shabbily dressed, touched me on the\narm.\n\n\"A rose, Signora!\"\n\nI gave it to her, smiling pityingly.\n\n\"God pray,\" she said, \"that this man will make you happier than he made\nme!\"\n\nThe prince was at my elbow, pushing me toward the carriage. But\nsomething had been said that could not be lightly passed. I stood firm.\n\n\"Let us be on!\" said the prince eagerly.\n\n\"Wait!\" I turned to the woman. \"Signora, what do you mean by those\nwords?\"\n\n\"His Highness knows.\" She pointed to the prince, whose face I now saw,\nstrangely enough, for the first time. It was black with rage and\nugliness.\n\n\"What has he been to you?\" I demanded.\n\nShe answered with a gesture, pathetic but easily translatable. It was\nenough for me. I understood. In that moment I became a woman without\nillusions. Without looking at the prince I entered the carriage and\nclosed the door in his face. He stormed, he pleaded, he lied. I was of\nstone. There was a scene. He was low enough to turn upon the poor woman\nand strike her across the face with his gloves. Even had I loved him,\nthat would have been the end of the romance. I ordered the driver to\ntake me home. There would be no wedding at the church that day. There\nwas a great scandal. Every one took up the prince's cause, with the\nexception of the king. But my determination was not to be moved.\n\nThe prince was almost bankrupt. He had squandered the liberal fortune\nleft him independently of the will. He had sold to the Jews half of the\nfortune he expected to get after marrying me. He had not the slightest\naffection for me; he was desperate and wanted the money. How old and\nwise I became during that ride home from the magistrate's! The prince\ncalled, but I was not at home to him. He wrote many times, but I replied\nto none of his letters. He struck but one string; I was foolish to let a\nlittle peccadillo of bachelorhood stand in the way; all men were the\nsame; the position I took was absurd. I never answered. I returned to\nVenice. I have seen him but twice since; once at Monte Carlo and that\nnight at the Villa Ariadne. How he begged, schemed, plotted, and\nmanoeuvered to regain my favor! But I knew now. I vowed he should never\nhave a penny; it should all go to the crown.\n\nWhen at length he found that I was really serious, he became base in his\ntactics. _He_ was the one who was wronged. He gave life to such rumors\namong those I knew that soon I found doors closed to me which had always\nbeen open. No Italian woman could see the matter from my point of view.\nI was an American for all that my mother was a Venetian, therefore I was\nwrong.\n\nSo great was this man's vanity that he truly believed that all he had to\ndo was to meet me face to face to overcome my objections! I have already\ntold you that my impulses are as mysterious to me as to others. Why I\nwent to the Villa Ariadne is not to be explained. I do not know.... A\ncomic opera singer! But I shall always love those light-hearted\ncompanions, who were cheerful under misfortune, who accepted each new\ncalamity as a jest by the Great Dramatist. Perhaps the truth is, this\nlast calamity was brought about by my desire to aid them without letting\nthem know who I was. I have committed many foolish acts, but innocent\nand hurtless. To you I have been perfectly frank. From the first I\nwarned you; and many times I have given you hurts which recoiled upon my\nown head. But all for your good. I wanted you to be clear of the tangle.\nThere! That is all. There is no more mystery concerning Sonia Hilda\nGrosvenor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so the letter ended. There was not a word regarding any future\nmeeting; there was nothing to read between the lines. A great loneliness\nsurged over Hillard. Was this, then, really the end? No! He struck the\nletter sharply on his palm. No, this should not be the end. He would\nwait here in Florence till the day of doom. He would waste no time in\nseeking her, for he knew that if he sought he would not find.\n\nDay after day dragged through the hours, and Florence grew thinned and\ntorrid. Sometimes he rode past the Villa Ariadne, but he never stopped.\nHe could not bring himself to enter those confines again alone.\n\nIn the meantime he had received a cable from Merrihew, stating that he\nand Mrs. Merrihew would be at home after September. He read the line\nmany times. Good old Dan! He was right; it took patience and persistence\nto win a woman.\n\nIt was in the middle of June that, one afternoon, the concierge handed\nhim a telegram. It contained but three words:\n\n\"Villa Serbelloni, Bellaggio.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nBELLAGGIO\n\n\nThe narrowness of the imagination of the old masters is generally\ndepicted in their canvases. Heaven to them was a serious business of\npearly gates, harps, halos, and a\u00c3\u00abrial flights on ambient pale clouds.\nOr, was it the imagination of the Church, dominating the imagination of\nthe artist? To paint halos, or to starve? was doubtless the Hamletonian\nquestion of the Renaissance. Now Hillard's idea of Heaven--and in all of\nus it is a singular conception--was Bellaggio in perpetual springtime;\nBellaggio, with its cypress, copper-beech, olive, magnolia, bamboo,\npines, its gardens, its vineyards, its orchards of mulberry trees, its\nrestful reaches, for there is always a quality of rest in the ability to\nsee far off; Bellaggio, with the emerald Lecco on one side and the\nblue-green Como on the other, the white villages nestling along the\nshores, and the great shadowful Italian Alps.\n\nThe Villa Serbelloni stands on the wooded promontory, and all day long\nthe warm sunshine floods its walls and terraces and glances from the\npolished leaves of the tropical plants. The villa remains to-day nearly\nas it was when Napoleon's forces were in Milan and stabling their horses\nin the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazia, under the fading _Last\nSupper_, by Da Vinci. It is a hotel now, the annex of one of the great\nhostelries down below in the town. A tortuous path leads up to the\nvilla; and to climb it is to perform the initial step or lesson to\nproper mountain-climbing. Here and there, in the blue distances, one\nfinds a patch of snow, an exhilarating foretaste of the high Alps north\nof Domo d' Ossola and south of the icy Rhone.\n\nThe six-o'clock boat from Como puffed up noisily and smokily to the\nquay, churning her side-paddles. The clouds of sunset lay like crimson\ngashes on the western mountain peaks. Hillard stepped ashore\nimpatiently. What a long day it had been! How white the Villa Serbelloni\nseemed up there on the little hill-top. He gave his luggage to the\nporter from the Grand and followed him on foot to the hotel, which was\nonly a dozen steps from the landing. No, he would not dine at the hotel,\nall but empty at this time of year. He was dining at the Villa\nSerbelloni above. He dressed quickly, but with the lover's care and the\nlover's doubt. Less than an hour after leaving the boat he stepped forth\nfrom the gardens and took the path up to the villa. The bloom on the\nwings of the passing swallow, the clouds on the face of the smooth\nwaters, the incense from the flowers now rising upon the vanished sun,\nthe tinted crests encircling, and the soft wind which murmured drowsily\namong the overhanging branches, all these made the time and place as\nperfect as a lover's mind could fancy.\n\nSonia, Sonia; his step took the rhythm of it as he climbed. Sonia,\nSonia; the very silence seemed to voice it. And she was waiting for him\nup there. How would she greet him, knowing that nothing would have\nbrought him to her side but the hope of love? With buoyant step he\nturned by the porter's lodge and strode down the broad roadway to the\nvilla, a deepening green arch above him.\n\nHandsome he was not; he was more. With his thin, high-bred face, his\nfine eyes, his slender, graceful figure, he presented that type of\ngentleman to whom all women pay unconscious homage, whether low-born or\nhigh, and in whom the little child places its trust and confidence.\n\nHe arrived shortly. As he entered the glass-inclosed corridor the\nconcierge rose from his chair and bowed. Hillard inclined his head and\nwent on. There was no one in the dining-room. In the restaurant there\nwas no one but a lonely Russian countess, who had spent part of the year\nat the villa for more than a decade. He doffed his hat as he passed\nthrough the room and gained the picturesque terrace. Afar he saw a table\nspread under the great oak. A woman sat by it. She was gazing down the\nwinding terraces toward the Lecco. It was still daylight, and he would\nhave known that head of hair among the ten thousand houris of heaven.\nSoftly, softly! he murmured to his heart, now become insurgent.\n\nWhatever may have been the dream she was following, she dismissed it\nupon hearing his step, strangely familiar. She did not rise, but she\nextended her hand, a grave inquiry in her slumbrous eyes. With equal\ngravity he clasped the hand, but held back the impulse to kiss it. He\nwas not quite sure of himself just then. He sat down opposite her and,\nsmiling, whimsically inquired:\n\n\"Now, where did we leave off?\"\n\nAt first she did not understand.\n\nHe enlightened her. \"I refer to that Arabian Nights entertainment in New\nYork. Where did we leave off that interesting discussion?\"\n\nShe smiled brightly. \"We shall take up the thread of that discourse with\nthe coffee.\"\n\n\"Why not countermand the order for dinner? I am not hungry.\"\n\n\"But I am,\" she replied. She was wholly herself now. The tact with which\nhe began his address disembarrassed her. For two days, since she\ndespatched the telegram, she had lived in a kind of ecstatic terror; she\nhad even regretted the message, once it was beyond recall. \"I am human\nenough to be hungry, sometimes.\" She summoned the waiter.\n\nThe dinner was excellent, but Hillard scarcely knew what this or that\nplate was. All his hunger lay in his eyes. Besides, he did not want to\ndiscuss generalities during the intermittent invasions of the waiter,\nwho never knew how many times he stood in danger of being hurled over\ninto the flowering beds of lavender which banked the path of the second\nterrace. And when he brought the coffee and lingered for further orders,\nit was Hillard who dismissed him, rather curtly.\n\n\"Now! Let me see,\" he said musingly. \"We had agreed that it would be\nbest never to meet again, that to keep the memory of that night fresh in\nour minds, a souvenir for old age, it were wisest to part then. Well, we\ncan keep the memory of it for our old age; it will be a little secret\nbetween us, and we shall talk it over on just such nights as this.\"\n\n\"Isn't this oak the most beautiful you have ever seen?\" she remarked,\nlooking up at the great leafy arms above her head.\n\n\"The most beautiful in all the world;\" but he was not looking at the\noak.\n\n\"Think of it! It's many centuries old. Empires and kingdoms have risen\nand vanished. It was here when Michelangelo and Raphael and Titian were\nragamuffins in the populous streets; it was leafing when Petrarch\nindited pages to his Laura; when Dante gazed melancholily upon his\nBeatrice--Oh, what a little time we have!\"\n\n\"Then let us make the most of it,\" he said.\n\nHe reached for her hand, which lay upon the cover; but, without apparent\nnotice of his movement, she drew back her hand.\n\n\"I have waited patiently for weeks.\"\n\nShe faced him with an enigmatical smile, lighted a match, blew it out,\nand drew a line across the center of the table.\n\nHe laughed. \"What, again?\"\n\n\"Observe.\"\n\n\"Why, there is a break in it!\" eagerly and joyously.\n\nShe leaned over. \"So there is;\" but there was no surprise in her voice.\n\n\"Is it possible for me to come through?\"\n\n\"There is one way.\"\n\n\"Put the caskets before me, Portia; I shall not be less wise than\nBassanio.\"\n\nShe touched her lips with the knuckle of a finger, in a mood reflective.\n\"A camel and the needle's eye.\"\n\n\"That referred to the rich man. All the world loves a lover, even the\nsolemn old prophets.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" a return of the old malice.\n\nAs a rejoinder he smoothed out the telegram she had sent to him. \"Why\ndid you send this to me?\"\n\nHer lips had no answer ready; and who can read a woman's heart?\n\n\"There can be but one reason,\" he pursued.\n\n\"Friendship.\"\n\nThere was a swish of petticoats, and she was standing at the side of her\nchair. The beginning of the night was cool, but the fire of the world's\ndesire burned in her cheeks, and she was afraid. She stepped to the\nrailing, faced the purpling mountains, lifted her chin, and sang _Die\nZauberfl\u00c3\u00b6te_. And Hillard dared not touch her till the last note was\ngone. She felt his nearness, however, as surely as if he had in fact\ntouched her. She tried to sing again, but this time no sound issued from\nher throat. There was something intangibly hypnotic in his gaze, for\npresently, without will, she turned and tried to look coldly into his\neyes.\n\n\"I did not come here because of friendship,\" he said. \"Only one thing\nbrought me--love and the hope of love.\"\n\nShe stared at him, her hand at her throat.\n\n\"Love and the hope of love,\" he repeated. Then he took her in his arms\nsuddenly, hungrily, even roughly. \"You are mine, mine; and nothing in\nthe world shall take you from my arms again. Sonia?\"\n\n\"Don't!\" she cried breathlessly. \"He is looking.\"\n\n\"It is only a waiter; he doesn't count. Friendship?\" He laughed.\n\n\"Please!\" still struggling.\n\n\"Not till you tell me why you sent that telegram.\"\n\nShe pressed her palms against him and stood away. She looked bravely\ninto his eyes now.\n\n[Illustration: \"Take me, and oh! be good and kind to me\"]\n\n\"I sent it because I wanted you, because I am tired of lying to my\nheart, because I have a right to be happy, because--because I love you!\nTake me, and oh! be good and kind to me, for I have been very lonely and\nunhappy.... Kiss me!\" with a touch of the old imperiousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rim of the early moon shouldered above the frowning death-mask of\nNapoleon, the huge salmon-tinted mountain on the far side of the Lecco.\nIn the villages the day-sounds had given way to the more peaceful voices\nof the night. They could hear the occasional light laughter of the\ngardeners on the second terrace; the bark of a dog in the hills; from\nthe house of the silk-weaver came the tinkle of a guitar. In the houses\non the hill opposite and in the villages below the first lights of\nevening began to glimmer, now here, now there, like fireflies become\nstationary.\n\n\"See Naples and die,\" she whispered, \"but the spirit will come to\nBellaggio.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Lure of the Mask, by Harold MacGrath\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LURE OF THE MASK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22158-8.txt or 22158-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/2\/1\/5\/22158\/\n\nProduced by Rick Niles, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1259,"split":"test"}
