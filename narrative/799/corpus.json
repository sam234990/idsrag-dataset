{"ori_id":"b9b1d29235c8e39aef27ce894e77a19955e6e51e","title":"Pericles, Prince of Tyre","context":"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\n John Gower introduces each act with a prologue. The play opens in the court of Antiochus, king of Antioch, who has offered the hand of his beautiful daughter to any man who answers his riddle; but those who fail shall die.\nI am no viper, yet I feed\n\nOn mother's flesh which did me breed.\n\nI sought a husband, in which labour\n\nI found that kindness in a father:\n\nHe's father, son, and husband mild;\n\nI mother, wife, and yet his child.\n\nHow they may be, and yet in two,\n\nAs you will live, resolve it you.\nPericles, the young Prince (ruler) of Tyre in Phoenicia (Lebanon), hears the riddle, and instantly understands its meaning: Antiochus is engaged in an incestuous relationship with his daughter. If he reveals this truth, he will be killed, but if he answers incorrectly, he will also be killed. Pericles hints that he knows the answer, and asks for more time to think. Antiochus grants him forty days, and then sends an assassin after him. However, Pericles has fled the city in disgust.\nPericles returns to Tyre, where his trusted friend and counsellor Helicanus advises him to leave the city, for Antiochus surely will hunt him down. Pericles leaves Helicanus as regent and sails to Tarsus, a city beset by famine. The generous Pericles gives the governor of the city, Cleon, and his wife Dionyza, grain from his ship to save their people. The famine ends, and after being thanked profusely by Cleon and Dionyza, Pericles continues on.\nA storm wrecks Pericles' ship and washes him up on the shores of Pentapolis. He is rescued by a group of poor fishermen who inform him that Simonedes, King of Pentapolis, is holding a tournament the next day and that the winner will receive the hand of his daughter Thaisa in marriage. Fortunately, one of the fishermen drags Pericles' suit of armour on shore that very moment, and the prince decides to enter the tournament. Although his equipment is rusty, Pericles wins the tournament and the hand of Thaisa (who is deeply attracted to him) in marriage. Simonedes initially expresses doubt about the union, but soon comes to like Pericles and allows them to wed.\nA letter sent by the noblemen reaches Pericles in Pentapolis, who decides to return to Tyre with the pregnant Thaisa. Again, a storm arises while at sea, and Thaisa appears to die giving birth to her child, Marina. The sailors insist that Thaisa's body be set overboard in order to calm the storm. Pericles grudgingly agrees, and decides to stop at Tarsus because he fears that Marina may not survive the storm.\nLuckily, Thaisa's casket washes ashore at Ephesus near the residence of Lord Cerimon, a physician who revives her. Thinking that Pericles died in the storm, Thaisa becomes a priestess in the temple of Diana.\nPericles departs to rule Tyre, leaving Marina in the care of Cleon and Dionyza.\nMarina grows up more beautiful than Philoten the daughter of Cleon and Dionyza, so Dionyza plans Marina's murder. The plan is thwarted when pirates kidnap Marina and then sell her to a brothel in Mytilene. There, Marina manages to keep her virginity by convincing the men that they should seek virtue. Worried that she is ruining their market, the brothel rents her out as a tutor to respectable young ladies. She becomes famous for music and other decorous entertainments.\nMeanwhile, Pericles returns to Tarsus for his daughter. The governor and his wife claim she has died; in grief, he takes to the sea.\nPericles' wanderings bring him to Mytilene where the governor Lysimachus, seeking to cheer him up, brings in Marina. They compare their sad stories and joyfully realise they are father and daughter. Next, the goddess Diana appears in a dream to Pericles, and tells him to come to the temple where he finds Thaisa. The wicked Cleon and Dionyza are killed when their people revolt against their crime. Lysimachus will marry Marina.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\nProject Gutenberg Etext of Pericles by Shakespeare\nPG has multiple editions of William Shakespeare's Complete Works\n\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep\nthese books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\n\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\n\n\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\n\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\n\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\nfrom Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\ndon't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg\/CMU\": and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Here must I Kill King\nPericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home:\n'tis dangerous.  Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and\nhad good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of\nthe king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do I\nsee he had some reason for 't; for if a king bid a man be a\nvillain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to be one.\nHush! here come the lords of Tyre.\n\n[Enter Helicanus and Escanes, with other Lords of Tyre.]\n\nHELICANUS.\nYou shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,\nFurther to question me of your king's departure:\nHis seal'd commission, left in trust with me,\nDoth speak sufficiently he 's gone to travel.\n\nTHALIARD.

[Aside.]\nWell, I perceive\nI shall not be hang'd now, although I would;\nBut since he 's gone, the king's seas must please\nHe  'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.\nI 'll present myself.  Peace to the lords of Tyre!\n\nHELICANUS.\nLord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.\n\nTHALIARD.\nFrom him I come\nWith message unto princely Pericles;\nBut since my landing I have understood\nYour lord has betook himself to unknown travels,\nMy message must return from whence it came.\n\nHELICANUS.\nWe have no reason to desire it,\nCommended to our master, not to us:\nYet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,\nAs friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nSCENE IV.

Come, dearest madam.  O, no tears,\nLychorida, no tears:\nLook to your little mistress, on whose grace\nYou may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nSCENE IV.  Ephesus.  A room in Cerimon's house.\n\n[Enter Cerimon and Thaisa.]\n\nCERIMON.\nMadam, this letter, and some certain jewels,\nLay with you in your coffer: which are now\nAt your command.  Know you the character?\n\nTHAISA.\nIt is my lord's.\nThat I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,\nEven on my eaning time; but whether there\nDeliver'd, by the holy gods,\nI cannot rightly say.  But since King Pericles,\nMy wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,\nA vestal livery will I take me to,\nAnd never more have joy.\n\nCERIMON.\nMadam, if this you purpose as ye speak,\nDiana's temple is not distant far,\nWhere you may abide till your date expire.\nMoreover, if you please, a niece of mine\nShall there attend you.\n\nTHAISA.\nMy recompense is thanks, that's all;\nYet my good will is great, though the gift small.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nACT IV.\n\n[Enter Gower.]\n\nGOWER.\nImagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,\nWelcomed and settled to his own desire.\nHis woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,\nUnto Diana there a votaress.\nNow to Marina bend your mind,\nWhom our fast-growing scene must find\nAt Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd\nIn music, letters; who hath gain'd\nOf education all the grace,\nWhich makes her both the heart and place\nOf general wonder. But, alack,\nThat monster envy, oft the wrack\nOf earned praise, Marina's life\nSeeks to take off by treason's knife.\nAnd in this kind hath our Cleon\nOne daughter, and a wench full grown,\nEven ripe for marriage-rite; this maid\nHight Philoten: and it is said\nFor certain in our story, she\nWould ever with Marina be:\nBe't when she weaved the sleided silk\nWith fingers long, small, white as milk;\nOr when she would with sharp needle wound,\nThe cambric, which she made more sound\nBy hurting it; or when to the lute\nShe sung, and made the night-bird mute\nThat still records with moan; or when\nShe would with rich and constant pen\nVail to her mistress Dian; still\nThis Philoten contends in skill\nWith absolute Marina: so\nWith the dove of Paphos might the crow\nVie feathers white.  Marina gets\nAll praises, which are paid as debts,\nAnd not as given. This so darks\nIn Philoten all graceful marks,\nThat Cleon's wife, with envy rare,\nA present murderer does prepare\nFor good Marina, that her daughter\nMight stand peerless by this slaughter.\nThe sooner her vile thoughts to stead,\nLychorida, our nurse, is dead:\nAnd cursed Dionyza hath\nThe pregnant instrument of wrath\nPrest for this blow. The unborn event\nI do commend to your content:\nOnly I carry winged time\nPost on the lame feet of my rhyme;\nWhich never could I so convey,\nUnless your thoughts went on my way.\nDionyza does appear,\nWith Leonine, a murderer.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nScene I.  Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.\n\n[Enter Dionyza and Leonine.]\n\nDIONYZA.\nThy  oath  remember;  thou hast sworn to do 't:\n'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.\nThou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,\nTo yield thee so much profit.  Let not conscience,\nWhich is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,\nInflame too nicely; nor let pity, which\nEven women have cast off, melt thee, but be\nA soldier to thy purpose.\n\nLEONINE.\nI will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.\n\nDIONYZA.\nThe fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here she comes\nweeping for her only mistress' death.  Thou art resolved?\n\nLEONINE.\nI am resolved.\n\n[Enter Marina, with a basket of flowers.]\n\nMARINA.\nNo, I will rob Tellus of her weed\nTo strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,\nThe purple violets, and marigolds,\nShall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,\nWhile summer-days do last.  Ay me! poor maid,\nBorn in a tempest, when my mother died,\nThis world to me is like a lasting storm,\nWhirring me from my friends.\n\nDIONYZA.\nHow now, Marina! why do you keep alone?\nHow chance my daughter is not with you? Do not\nConsume your blood with sorrowing: you have\nA nurse of me.  Lord, how your favour's changed\nWith this unprofitable woe!\nCome, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.\nWalk with Leonine; the air is quick there,\nAnd it pierces and sharpens the stomach.\nCome,\nLeonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.\n\nMARINA.\nNo, I pray you;\nI'll not bereave you of your servant.\n\nDIONYZA.\nCome, come;\nI love the king your father, and yourself,\nWith more than foreign heart. We every day\nExpect him here: when he shall come and find\nOur paragon to all reports thus blasted,\nHe will repent the breadth of his great voyage;\nBlame both my lord and me, that we have taken\nNo care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,\nWalk, and be cheerful once again; reserve\nThat excellent complexion, which did steal\nThe eyes of young and old. Care not for me;\nI can go home alone.\n\nMARINA.\nWell, I will go;\nBut yet I have no desire to it.\n\nDIONYZA.\nCome, come, I know 'tis good for you.\nWalk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:\nRemember what I have said.\n\nLEONINE.\nI warrant you, madam.\n\nDIONYZA.\nI'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:\nPray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:\nWhat! I must have a care of you.\n\nMARINA.\nMy thanks, sweet madam.\n\n[Exit Dionyza.]\n\nIs this wind westerly that blows?\n\nLEONINE.\nSouth-west.\n\nMARINA.\nWhen I was born, the wind was north.\n\nLEONINE.\nWas 't so?\n\nMARINA.\nMy father, as nurse said, did never fear,\nBut cried 'Good seamen!' to the sailors, galling\nHis kingly hands, haling ropes;\nAnd, clasping to the mast, endured a sea\nThat almost burst the deck.\n\nLEONINE.\nWhen was this?\n\nMARINA.\nWhen I was born:\nNever was waves nor wind more violent;\nAnd from the ladder-tackle washes off\nA canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, wilt out?'\nAnd with a dropping industry they skip\nFrom stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and\nThe master calls, and trebles their confusion.\n\nLEONINE.\nCome, say your prayers.\n\nMARINA.\nWhat mean you?\n\nLEONINE.\nIf you require a little space for prayer,\nI grant it: pray; but be not tedious,\nFor the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn\nTo do my work with haste.\n\nMARINA.\nWhy will you kill rne?\n\nLEONINE.\nTo satisfy my lady.\n\nMARINA.\nWhy would she have me kill'd?\nNow, as I can remember, by my troth,\nI never did her hurt in all my life:\nI never spoke bad word, nor did ill turn\nTo any living creature: believe me, la,\nI never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:\nI trod upon a worm against my will,\nBut I wept for it.  How have I offended,\nWherein my death might yield her any profit,\nOr my life imply her any danger?\n\nLEONINE.\nMy commission\nIs not to reason of the deed, but do it.\n\nMARINA.\nYou will not do 't for all the world, I hope.\nYou are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow\nYou have a gentle heart.  I saw you lately,\nWhen you caught hurt in parting two that fought:\nGood sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:\nYour lady seeks my life; come you between,\nAnd save poor me, the weaker.\n\nLEONINE.\nI am sworn,\nAnd will dispatch.\n\n[He seizes her.]\n\n[Enter Pirates.]\n\nFIRST PIRATE.\nHold, villain!\n\n[Leonine runs away.]\n\nSECOND PIRATE.\nA prize! a prize!\n\nTHIRD PIRATE.\nHalf-part, mates, half-part,\nComes, let's have her aboard suddenly.\n\n[Exeunt Pirates with Marina.]\n\n[Re-enter Leonine.]\n\nLEONINE.\nThese roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;\nAnd they hav seized Marina. Let her go:\nThre's no hope she will return. I'll swear she's dead\nAnd thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:\nPerhaps they will but please themselves upon her,\nNot carry her aboard.  If she remain,\nWhom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\nScene II. Mytilene.  A room in a brothel.\n\n[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and Boult.]\n\nPANDAR.\nBoult!\n\nBOULT.\nSir?\n\nPANDAR.\nSearch the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of gallants. We lost\ntoo much money this mart by being too wenchless.\n\nBAWD.\nWe were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three,\nand they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual\naction are even as good as rotten.\n\nPANDAR.\nTherefore let's have fresh ones, whate'r we pay for them.  If\nthere be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall\nnever prosper.\n\nBAWD.\nThou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor bastards, --\nas, I think, I have bought up some eleven --\n\nBOULT.\nAy, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search\nthe market?\n\nBAWD.\nWhat else, man?  The stuff we have, a strong wind will blo it to\npieces, they are so pitifully sodden.\n\nPANDAR.\nThou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o' conscience. The\npoor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.\n\nBOULT.\nAy, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms.\nBut I'll go search the market.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPANDAR.\nThree or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to\nlive quietly, and so give over.\n\nBAWD.\nWgy to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get when we are\nold?\n\nPANDAR.\nO, our credit comes not in like the commodity , nor the commodity\nwages not with the danger: therfore, if in our youths we could\npick up some pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door\nhatched.  Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will\nbe strong with us for giving over.\n\nBAWD.\nCome, others sorts offend as well as we.\n\nPANDAR.\nAs well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is\nour profession any trade; it's no calling.  But here comes Boult.\n\n[Re-enter Boult, with the Pirates and Marina.]\n\nBOULT\n[To Marina.]\nCome your ways. My masters, you say she's a virgin?\n\nFIRST PIRATE.\nO, sir, we doubt it not.\n\nBOULT.\nMaster, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like\nher, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.\n\nBAWD.\nBoult, has she any qualities?\n\nBOULT.\nShe has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent clothes:\nther's no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused.\n\nBAWD.\nWhat is her price, Boult?\n\nBOULT.\nI cannot be baited one doit of a thousand pieces.\n\nPANDAR.\nWell, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently.\nWife, take her in; instruct her what she has to do, that she may\nnot be raw in her entertainment.\n\n[Exeunt Pandar and Pirates.]\n\nBAWD.\nBoult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair,\ncomplexion, height, age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry\n'He that will give most shall have her first.' Such a maidenhead\nwere no cheap thing, if men were as they have been. Get this\ndone as I command you.\n\nBOULT.\nPerformance shall follow.\n\n[Exit.\n\nMARINA.\nAlack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!\nHe should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,\nNot enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me\nFor to seek my mother!\n\nBARD.\nWhy lament you, pretty one?\n\nMARINA.\nThat I am pretty.\n\nBAWD.\nCome, the gods have done their part in you.\n\nMARINA.\nI accuse them not.\n\nBAWD.\nYou are light into my hands, where you are like to live.\n\nMARINA.\nThe more my fault\nTo scape his hands where I was like to die.\n\nBAWD.\nAy, and you shall live in pleasure.\n\nMARINA.\nNo.\n\nBAWD.\nYes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions: you\nshall fare well; you shall have the difference of all complexions.\nWhat! do you stop your ears?\n\nMARINA.\nAre you a woman?\n\nBAWD.\nWhat would you have me be, an I be not a woman?\n\nMARINA.\nAn honest woman, or not a woman.\n\nBAWD.\nMarry, whip the, gosling: I think I shall have something to do\nwith you. Come, you're a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed\nas I would have you.\n\nMARINA.\nThe gods defend me!\n\nBAWD.\nIf it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort\nyou, men must feed you, men must stir you up.  Boult's returned.\n\n[Re-enter Boult.]\n\nNow, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?\n\nBOULT.\nI have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn\nher picture with my voice.\n\nBAWD.\nAnd I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the\npeople, especially of the younger sort?\n\nBOULT.\n'Faith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their\nfather's testament.  There was a Spaniard's mouth so watered,\nthat he went to bed to her very description.\n\nBAWD.\nWe shall have him here to-morrow: with his best ruff on.\n\nBOULT.\nTo-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the French knight\nthat cowers i' the hams?\n\nBAWD.\nWho, Monsieur Veroles?\n\nBOULT.\nAy, he: he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he\nmade a groan at it, and swore he would see her to-morrow.\n\nBAWD.\nWell. well; as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he\ndoes but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to\nscatter his crowns in the sun.\n\nBOULT.\nWell, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them\nwith this sign.\n\n[To Marina.]\nPray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you.\nMark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit\nwillingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that\nyou live as ye do makes pity in your lovers: seldom but that\npity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.\n\nMARINA.\nI understand you not.\n\nBOULT.\nO, take her home, mistress, take her home: these blushes of hers\nmust be quenched with some present practice.\n\nBAWD.\nThou sayest true, i' faith so they must; for your bride goes to\nthat with shame which is her way to go with warrant.\n\nBOULT.\n'Faith, some do and some do not. But, mistress, if I have\nbargained for the joint, --\n\nBAWD.\nThou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.\n\nBOULT.\nI may so.\n\nBAWD.\nWho should deny it? Come young one, I like the manner of your\ngarments well.\n\nBOULT.\nAy, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.\n\nBAWD.\nBoult, spend thou that in the town: report what a sojourner we\nhave; you'll lose nothing by custom. When nature framed this\npiece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon\nshe is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.\n\nBOULT.\nI warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of\neels as my giving out her Beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined.\nI'll bring home some to-night.\n\nBAWD.\nCome your ways; follow me.\n\nMARINA.\nIf fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,\nUntied I still my virgin knot will keep.\nDiana, aid my purpose!\n\nBAWD.\nWhat have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nSCENE III.  Tarsus. A room in Cleon's house.\n\n[Enter Cleon and Dionyza.]\n\nDIONYZA.\nWhy, are you foolish?  Can it be undone?\n\nCLEON.\nO, Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter\nThe sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!\n\nDIONYZA.\nI think\nYou'll turn a child agan.\n\nCLEON.\nWere I chief lord of all this spacious world,\nI'ld give it to undo the deed.  0 lady,\nMuch less in blood than virtue, yet a princess\nTo equal any single crown o' the earth\nI' the justice of compare!  O villain Leonine!\nWhom thou hast poison'd too:\nIf thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness\nBecoming well thy fact: what canst thou say\nWhen noble Pericles shall demand his child?\n\nDIONYZA.\nThat she is dead.  Nurses are not the fates,\nTo foster it, nor ever to preserve.\nShe died at night; I'11 say so. Who can cross it?\nUnless you play the pious innocent,\nAnd for an honest attribute cry out\n'She died by foul play.'\n\nCLEON.\nO, go to.  Well, well,\nOf all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods\nDo like this worst.\n\nDIONYZA.\nBe one of those that think.\nThe petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,\nAnd open this to Pericles. I do shame\nTo think of what a noble strain you are,\nAnd of how coward a spirit.\n\nCLEON.\nTo such proceeding\nWhoever but his approbation added,\nThough not his prime consent, he did not flow\nFrom honourable sources,\n\nDIONYZA.\nBe it so, then:\nYet none does know, but you, how she came dead,\nNor none can know, Leonine being gone.\nShe did distain my child, and stood between\nHer and her fortunes: none would look on her,\nBut cast their gazes on Marina's face;\nWhilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin\nNot worth the time of day.  It pierced me through;\nAnd though you call my course unnatural,\nYou not your child well loving, yet I find\nIt greets me as an enterprise of kindness\nPerform'd to your sole daughter.\n\nCLEON.\nHeavens forgive it!\n\nDIONYZA.\nAnd as for Pericles,\nWhat should he say? We wept after her hearse,\nAnd yet we mourn: her monument\nIs almost finish'd, and her epitaphs\nIn glittering golden characters express\nA general praise to her, and care in us\nAt whose expense 'tis done.\n\nCLEON.\nThou art like the harpy,\nWhich, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,\nSeize with thine eagle's talons.\n\nDIONYZA.\nYou are like one that superstitiously\nDoth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:\nBut yet I know you'll do as I advise.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n[Enter Gower, before the monument of Marina at Tarsus.]\n\nGOWER.\nThus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;\nSail seas in cockles, have an wish but for 't;\nMaking, to take your imagination,\nFrom bourn to bourn, region to region.\nBy you  being pardon'd, we commit no crime\nTo use one language in each several clime\nWhere our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you\nTo learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,\nThe stages of our story.  Pericles\nIs now again thwarting the wayward seas\nAttended on by many a lord and knight,\nTo see his daughter, all his life's deight.\nOld Escanes, whom Helicanus late\nAdvanced in time to great and high estate.\nIs left to govern. Bear you it in mind,\nOld Helicanus goes along behind\nWell-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought\nThis king to Tarsus, -- think his pilot thought;\nSo with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on, --\nTo fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.\nLike motes and shadows see them move awhile;\nYour ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.\n\n[Dumb Show.]\n\n[Enter Pericles, at one door, with all his train; Cleon and\nDionyza, at the other. Cleon shows Pericles the tomb; whereat\nPericles makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a\nmighty passion departs. Then exeunt Cleon and Dionyza.]\n\nSee how belief may suffer by foul show;\nThis borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;\nAnd Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,\nWith sighs shot through; and biggest tears o'ershower'd,\nLeaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears\nNever to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:\nHe puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears\nA tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,\nAnd yet he rides it out. Now please you wit\nThe epitaph is for Marina writ\nBy wicked Dionyza.\n\n[Reads the inscription on Marina's monument.]\n'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,\nWho wither'd in her spring of year.\nShe was of Tyrus the king's daughter,\nOn whom foul death hath made this slaughter;\nMarina was she call'd; and at her birth,\nThetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:\nTherefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,\nHath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:\nWherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,\nMake raging battery upon shores of flint.'\n\nNo visor does become black villany\nSo well as soft and tender flattery.\nLet Pericles believe his daughter's dead,\nAnd bear his courses to be ordered\nBy Lady Fortune; while our scene must play\nHis daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day\nIn her unholy service. Patience, then,\nAnd think you now are all in Mytilene.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\nSCENE V.  Mytilene.  A street before the brothel.\n\n[Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen.]\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nDid you ever hear the like?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nNo, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she being once\ngone.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nBut to have divinity preached there! did you ever dream of such a\nthing?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nNo, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses: shall's go hear the\nvestals sing?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I am out of the road\nof rutting for ever.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nSCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.\n\n[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and Boult.]\n\nPANDAR.\nWell, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne'er come\nhere.\n\nBAWD.\nFie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo\na whole generation. We must either get her ravished, or be rid of\nher. When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the\nkindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons,\nher master reasons, her prayers, her knees; that she would make\na puritan of the devil, if he should cheapen a kiss of her.\n\nBOULT.\n'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of all our\ncavaliers, and make our swearers priests.\n\nPANDAR.\nNow, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!\n\nBAWD.\n'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the way to the pox.\nHere comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.\n\nBOULT.\nWe should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would\nbut give way to customers.\n\n[Enter Lysimachus.]\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nHow now!  How a dozen of virginities?\n\nBAWD.\nNow, the gods to bless your honour!\n\nBOULT.\nI am glad to see your honour in good health.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nYou may so; 'tis the better for you that your resorters stand\nupon sound legs. How now! wholesome iniquity have you that a\nman may deal withal, and defy the surgeon?\n\nBAWD.\nWe have here one, sir, if she would -- but there never came her\nlike in Mytilene.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nIf she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.\n\nBAWD.\nYour honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWell, call forth, call forth.\n\nBOULT.\nFor flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose;\nand she were a rose indeed, if she had but --\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWhat, prithee?\n\nBOULT.\nO, sir, I can be modest.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nThat dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it gives a good\nreport to a number to be chaste.\n\n[Exit Boult.]\n\nBAWD.\nHere comes that which grows to the stalk; never plucked yet, I\ncan assure you.\n\n[Re-enter Boult with Marina.]\n\nIs she not a fair creature?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\n'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. Well, there's\nfor you:  leave us.\n\nBAWD.\nI beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and I'll have done\npresently.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nI beseech you, do.\n\nBAWD.\n[To Marina.]\nFirst, I would have you note, this is an honourable man.\n\nMARINA.\nI desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.\n\nBAWD.\nNext, he's the governor of this country, and a man whom I am\nbound to.\n\nMARINA.\nIf he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed; but how\nhonourable he is in that, I know not.\n\nBAWD.\nPray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him\nkindly? He will line your apron with gold.\n\nMARINA.\nWhat he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nHa' you done?\n\nBAWD.\nMy lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some pains to work\nher to your manage. Come, we will leave his honour and her\ntogether.  Go thy ways.\n\n[Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and Boult.]\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nNow, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?\n\nMARINA.\nWhat trade, sir?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWhy, I cannot name't but I shall offend.\n\nMARINA.\nI cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nHow long have you been of this profession?\n\nMARINA.\nE'er since I can remember?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nDid you go to't so young? Were you a gamester at five or at\nseven?\n\nMARINA.\nEarlier, too, sir, if now I be one.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWhy, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of\nsale.\n\nMARINA.\nDo you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will\ncome into 't? I hear say you are of honourable parts, and are\nthe governor of this place.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWhy, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?\n\nMARINA.\nWho is my principal?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nWhy, your herb-woman;  she that sets seeds and roots of shame and\niniquity. O, you have heard something of my power, and so stand\naloof for more serious wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one,\nmy authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee.\nCome, bring me to some private place: come, come.\n\nMARINA.\nIf you were born to honour, show it now;\nIf put upon you, make the judgement good\nThat thought you worthy of it.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nHow 's  this?  how 's this? Some more; be sage.\n\nMARINA.\nFor me,\nThat am a maid, though most ungentle fortune\nHave placed me in this sty, where, since I came,\nDiseases have been sold dearer than physic,\nO, that the gods\nWould set me free from this unhallow'd place,\nThough they did change me to the meanest bird\nThat flies i' the purer air!\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nI did not think\nThou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.\nHad I brought hither a corrupted mind,\nThy speech had alter'd it.

On board Pericles' ship, off Mytilene. A close pavilion\non deck, with a curtain before it; Pericles within it, reclined\non a couch.  A barge lying beside the Tyrian vessel.\n\n[Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other\nto the barge; to them Helicanus.]\n\nTYRIAN SAILOR.\n[To the Sailor of Mytilene.]\nWhere is lord Helicanus? he can resolve you.\nO, here he is.\nSir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,\nAnd in it is Lysimachus the governor,\nWho craves to come aboard. What is your will?\n\nHELICANUS.\nThat he have his. Call up some gentlemen.\n\nTYRIAN SAILOR.\nHo, gentlemen! my lord calls.\n\n[Enter two or three Gentlemen.]\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nDoth your lordship call?\n\nHELICANUS.\nGentlemen, there s some of worth would come aboard;\nI pray ye, greet them fairly.\n\n[The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the\nbarge.\n\nEnter, from thence, Lysimachus and Lords; with the Gentlemen and\nthe two sailors.\n\nTYRIAN SAILOR.\nSir,\nThis is the man that can, in aught you would,\nResolve you.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nHail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!\n\nHELICANUS.\nAnd you, sir, to outlive the age I am,\nAnd die as I would do.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nYou wish me well.\nBeing on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,\nSeeing this goodly vessel ride before us,\nI made to it, to know of whence you are.\n\nHELICANUS.\nFirst, what is your place?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nI am the governor of this place you lie before.\n\nHELICANUS.\nSir,\nOur vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;\nA man who for this three months hath not spoken\nTo any one, nor taken sustenance\nBut to prorogue his grief.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nUpon what ground is his distemperature?\n\nHELICANUS.\n'Twould be too tedious to repeat;\nBut the main grief springs from the loss\nOf a beloved daughter and a wife.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nMay we not see him?\n\nHELICANUS.\nYou may;\nBut bootless is your sight: he will not speak\nTo any.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nYet let me obtain my wish.\n\nHELICANUS.\nBehold him.\n[Pericles discovered.]\nThis was a goodly person.\nTill the disaster that, one mortal night,\nDrove him to this.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nSir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!\nHail, royal sir!\n\nHELICANUS.\nIt is in vain; he will not speak to you.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSir,\nWe have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,\nWould win some words of him.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\n'Tis well bethought.\nShe questionless with her sweet harmony\nAnd other chosen attractions, would allure,\nAnd make a battery through his deafen'd parts,\nWhich now are midway stopp'd:\nShe is all happy as the fairest of all,\nAnd, with her fellow maids, is now upon\nThe leafy shelter that abuts against\nThe island's side.\n\n[Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of Lysimachus.]\n\nHELICANUS.\nSure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit\nThat bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness\nWe have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you\nThat for our gold we may provision have,\nWherein we are not destitute for want,\nBut weary for the staleness.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nO, sir, a courtesy\nWhich if we should deny, the most just gods\nFor every graff would send a catepillar,\nAnd so afflict our province. Yet once more\nLet me entreat to know at large the cause\nOf your king's sorrow.\n\nHELICANUS.\nSit, sir, I will recount it to you:\nBut, see, I am prevented.\n\n[Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with Marina, and a young Lady.]\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nO, here is\nThe lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!\nIs't not a goodly presence?\n\nHELICANUS.\nShe's a gallant lady.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nShe's such a one, that, were I well assured\nCame of a gentle kind and noble stock,\nI'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.\nFair one, all goodness that consists in bounty\nExpect even here, where is a kingly patient:\nIf that thy prosperous and artificial feat\nCan draw him but to answer thee in aught,\nThy sacred physic shall receive such pay\nAs thy desires can wish.\n\nMARINA.\nSir, I will use\nMy utmost skill in his recovery,\nProvided\nThat none but I and my companion maid\nBe suffer'd to come near him.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nCome, let us leave her,\nAnd the gods make her prosperous!\n\n[Marina sings.]\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nMark'd he your music?\n\nMARINA.\nNo, nor look'd on us,\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nSee, she will speak to him.\n\nMARINA.\nHail, sir! my lord, lend ear.\n\nPERICLES.\nHum, ha!\n\nMARINA.\nI am a maid,\nMy lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,\nBut have been gazed on like a cornet: she speaks,\nMy lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief\nMight equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.\nThough wayward fortune did malign my state,\nMy derivation was from ancestors\nWho stood equivalent with mighty kings:\nBut time hath rooted out my parentage,\nAnd to the world and awkward casualties\nBound me in servitude.\n[Aside.]\nI will desist;\nBut there is something glows upon my cheek,\nAnd whispers in mine ear 'Go not till he speak.'\n\nPERICLES.\nMy fortunes -- parentage -- good parentage --\nTo equal mine! -- was it not thus? what say you?\n\nMARINA.\nI said, my lord, if you did know my parentage.\nYou would not do me violence.\n\nPERICLES.\nI do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.\nYou are like something that -- What country-woman?\nHere of these shores?\n\nMARINA.\nNo, nor of any shores:\nYet I was mortally brought forth, and am\nNo other than I appear.\n\nPERICLES.\nI am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.\nMy dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one\nMy daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;\nHer stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;\nAs silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like\nAnd cased as richly; in pace another Juno;\nWho starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,\nThe more she gives them speech. Where do you live?\n\nMARINA.\nWhere I am but a stranger: from the deck\nYou may discern the place.\n\nPERICLES.\nWhere were you bred?\nAnd how achieved you these endowments, which\nYou make more rich to owe?\n\nMARINA.\nIf I should tell my history, it would seem\nLike lies disdain'd in the reporting.\n\nPERICLES.\nPrithee, speak:\nFalseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st\nModest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace\nFor the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will believe thee,\nAnd make my senses credit thy relation\nTo points that seem impossible;  for thou look'st\nLike one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?\nDidst thou not say, when I did push thee back --\nWhich was when I perceived thee -- that thou earnest\nFrom good descending?\n\nMARINA.\nSo indeed I did.\n\nPERICLES.\nReport thy parentage.  I think thou said'st\nThou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,\nAnd that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,\nIf both were open'd.\n\nMARINA.\nSome such thing,\nI said, and said no more but what my thoughts\nDid warrant me was likely.\n\nPERICLES.\nTell thy story;\nIf thine consider'd prove the thousandth part\nOf my endurance, thou art a man, and I\nHave suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look\nLike Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling\nExtremity out of act. What were thy friends?\nHow lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?\nRecount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.\n\nMARINA.\nMy name is Marina.\n\nPERICLES.\nO, I am mock'd,\nAnd thou by some incensed god sent hither\nTo make the world to laugh at me.\n\nMARINA.\nPatience, good sir,\nOr here I'll cease.\n\nPERICLES.\nNay, I'll be patient.\nThou little know'st how thou dost startle me,\nTo call thyself Marina.\n\nMARINA.\nThe name\nWas given me by one that had some power,\nMy father, and a king.\n\nPERICLES.\nHow! a king's daughter?\nAnd call'd Marina?\n\nMARINA.\nYou said you would believe me;\nBut, not to be a troubler of your peace,\nI will end here.\n\nPERICLES.\nBut are you flesh and blood?\nHave you a working pulse? and are no fairy?\nMotion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?\nAnd wherefore call'd Marina?\n\nMARINA.\nCall'd Marina\nFor I was born at sea.\n\nPERICLES.\nAt sea! what mother?\n\nMARINA.\nMy mother was the daughter of a king;\nWho died the minute I was born,\nAs my good nurse Lychorida hath oft\nDeliver'd weeping.\n\nPERICLES.\nO, stop there a little!\n\n[Aside.]\n\nThis is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep\nDid mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:\nMy daughter's buried. Well: where were: you bred?\nI'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,\nAnd never interrupt you.\n\nMARINA.\nYou scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.\n   -\n\nPERICLES.\nI will believe you by the syllable\nOf what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:\nHow came you in these parts? where were you bred?\n\nMARINA.\nThe king my father did in Tarsus leave me;\nTill cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,\nDid seek to murder me: and having woo'd\nA villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do 't,\nA crew of pirates came and rescued me;\nBrought me to Mytilene.  But, good sir.\nWhither will you have me?  Why do you weep? It may be,\nYou think me an impostor: no, good faith;\nI am the daughter to King Pericles,\nIf good King Pericles be.\n\nPERICLES.\nHo, Helicanus!\n\nHELICANUS.\nCalls my lord?\n\nPERICLES.\nThou art a grave and noble counsellor,\nMost wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,\nWhat this maid is, or what is like to be,\nThat thus hath made me weep?\n\nHELICANUS.\nI know not; but\nHere is the regent, sir, of Mytilene\nSpeaks nobly of her.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nShe would never tell\nHer parentage; being demanded that,\nShe would sit still and weep.\n\nPERICLES.\nO Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;\nGive me a gash, put me to present pain;\nLest this great sea of joys rushing upon me\nO'erbear the shores of my mortality,\nAnd drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,\nThou that beget'st him that did thee beget;\nThou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,\nAnd found at sea again! O Helicanus,\nDown on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud\nAs thunder threatens us: this is Marina.\nWhat was thy mother's name? tell me but that,\nFor truth can never be confirm'd enough,\nThough doubts did ever sleep\n\nMARINA.\nFirst, sir, I pray,\nWhat is your title?\n\nPERICLES.\nI am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now\nMy drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said\nThou hast been godlike perfect,\nThe heir of kingdoms and another like\nTo Pericles thy father.\n\nMARINA.\nIs it no more to be your daughter than\nTo say my mother's name was Thaisa?\nThaisa was my mother, who did end\nThe minute I began.\n\nPERICLES.\nNow, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.\nGive me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;\nShe is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,\nBy savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;\nWhen thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge\nShe is thy very princess. Who is this?\n\nHELICANUS.\nSir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,\nWho, hearing of your melancholy state,\nDid come to see you.\n\nPERICLES.\nI embrace you.\nGive me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.\nO heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?\nTell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him\nO'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,\nHow sure you are my daughter. But, what music?\n\nHELICANUS.\nMy lord, I hear none.\n\nPERICLES.\nNone!\nThe music of the spheres! List, my Marina.\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nIt is not good to cross him; give him way\n\nPERICLES.\nRarest sounds! Do ye not hear?\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nMy lord, I hear.\n\n[Music.]\n\nPERICLES.\nMost heavenly music!\nIt nips me unto listening, and thick slumber\nHangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.\n\n[Sleeps.]\n\nLYSIMACHUS.\nA pillow for his head:\nSo, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,\nIf this but answer to my just belief,\nI'll well remember you.\n\n[Exeunt all but Pericles.]\n\n[Diana appears to Pericles as in a vision.]\n\nDIANA.\nMy temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,\nAnd do upon mine altar sacrifice.\nThere, when my maiden priests are met together,\nBefore the people all,\nReveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:\nTo mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call\nAnd give them repetition to the life.\nOr perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe:\nDo it, and happy; by my silver bow!\nAwake, and tell thy dream.\n\n[Disappears.]\n\nPERICLES.\nCelestial Dian, goddess argentine,\nI will obey thee.

Enter Gower, before the temple of Diana at Ephesus.\n\nGOWER.\nNow our sands are almost run;\nMore a little, and then dumb.\nThis, my last boon, give me,\nFor such kindness must relieve me,\nThat you aptly will suppose\nWhat pageantry, what feats, what shows,\nWhat minstrelsy, and pretty din,\nThe regent made in Mytilene\nTo greet the king. So he thrived,\nThat he is promised to be wived\nTo fair Marina; but in no wise\nTill he had done his sacrifice,\nAs Dian bade: whereto being bound,\nThe interim, pray you, all confound.\nIn feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,\nAnd wishes fall out as they're will'd.\nAt Ephesus, the temple see,\nCur king and all his company.\nThat he can hither come so soon,\nIs by your fancy's thankful doom.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\nSCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus; Thaisa standing near\nthe altar, as high priestess; a number of Virgins on each side;\nCerimon and other inhabitants of Ephesus attending.\n\n[Enter Pericles, with his train; Lysimachus, Helicanus, Marina,\nand a Lady.]\n\nPERICLES.\nHail, Dian! to perform thy just command,\nI here confess myself the king of Tyre;\nWho, frighted from my country, did wed\nAt Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.\nAt sea in childbed died she, but brought forth\nA maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,\nWears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus\nWas nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years\nHe sought to murder: but her better stars\nBrought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore\nRiding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,\nWhere by her own most clear remembrance, she\nMade known herself my daughter.\n\nTHAISA.\nVoice and favour!\nYou are, you are -- O royal Pericles!\n\n[Faints.]\n\nPERICLES.\nWhat means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!\n\nCERIMON.\nNoble sir,\nIf you have told Diana's altar true,\nThis is your wife.\n\nPERICLES.\nReverend appearer, no;\nI threw her overboard with these very arms.\n\nCERIMON.\nUpon this coast, I warrant you.\n\nPERICLES.\n'Tis most certain.\n\nCERIMON.\nLook to the lady; O, she's but o'er-joy'd.\nEarly in blustering morn this lady was\nThrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,\nFound there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her\nHere in Diana's temple.\n\nPERICLES.\nMay we see them?\n\nCERIMON.\nGreat sir, they shall be brought you to my house,\nWhither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is\nRecovered.\n\nTHAISA.\nO, let me look!\nIf he be none of mine, my sanctity\nWill to my sense bend no licentious ear,\nBut curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,\nAre you not Pericles? Like him you spake,\nLike him you are: did you not name a tempest,\nA birth, and death?\n\nPERICLES.\nThe voice of dead Thaisa!\n\nTHAISA.\nThat Thaisa am I, supposed dead\nAnd drown'd.\n\nPERICLES.\nImmortal Dian!\n\nTHAISA.\nNow I know you better,\nWhen we with tears parted Pentapolis,\nThe king my father gave you such a ring.\n\n[Shows a ring.]\n\nPERICLES.\nThis, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness\nMakes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,\nThat on the touching of her lips I may\nMelt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried\nA second time within these arms.\n\nMARINA.\nMy heart\nLeaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.\n\n[Kneels to Thaisa.]\n\nPERICLES.\nLook, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;\nThy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina\nFor she was yielded there.\n\nTHAISA.\nBlest, and mine own!\n\nHELICANUS.\nHail, madam, and my queen!\n\nTHAISA.\nI know you not.\n\nPERICLES.\nYou have heard me say, when did fly from Tyre,\nI left behind an ancient substitute:\nCan you remember what I call'd the man\nI have named him oft.\n\nTHAISA.\n'Twas Helicanus then.\n\nPERICLES.\nStill confirmation:\nEmbrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.\nNow do I long to hear how you were found:\nHow possibly preserved; and who to thank,\nBesides the gods, for this great miracle.\n\nTHAISA.\nLord Cerimon, my lord; this man,\nThrough whom the gods have shown their power; that can\nFrom first to last resolve you.\n\nPERICLES.\nReverend sir,\nThe gods can have no mortal officer\nMore like a god than you. Will you deliver\nHow this dead queen re-lives?\n\nCERIMON.\nI will, my lord\nBeseech you, first go with me to my house,\nWhere shall be shown you all was found with her;\nHow she came placed here in the temple;\nNo needful thing omitted.\n\nPERICLES.\nPure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I\nWill offer night-oblations to thee.  Thaisa,\nThis prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,\nShall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,\nThis ornament\nMakes me look dismal will I clip to form;\nAnd what this fourteen years no razor touch'd\nTo grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.\n\nTHAISA.\nLord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,\nMy father's dead.\n\nPERICLES.\nHeavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,\nWe'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves\nWill in that kingdom spend our following days:\nOur son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.\nLord Cerimon, we do our longing stay\nTo hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n[Enter Gower.]\n\nGOWER.\nIn Antiochus and his daughter you have heard\nOf monstrous lust the due and just reward:\nIn Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,\nAlthough assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,\nVirtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,\nLed on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:\nIn Helicanus may you well descry\nA figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:\nIn reverend Cerimon there well appears\nThe worth that learned charity aye wears:\nFor wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame\nHad spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name\nOf Pericles, to rage the city turn,\nThat him and his they in his palace burn;\nThe gods for murder seemed so content\nTo punish them although not done but meant.\nSo, on your patence evermore attending,\nNew joy wait on you!
