{"ori_id":"339a7a65cc21054c3b86fcc1b089b96ded1db7e5","title":"The Robbers","context":"The Robbers\n The plot revolves around the conflict between two aristocratic brothers, Karl and Franz Moor. The charismatic but rebellious student Karl is deeply loved by his father. The younger brother, Franz, who appears as a cold, calculating villain, plots to wrest away Karl's inheritance. As the play unfolds, both Franz's motives and Karl's innocence and heroism are revealed to be complex.\nSchiller's highly emotional language and his depiction of physical violence mark the play as a quintessential Sturm und Drang work. At the same time, the play utilizes a traditional five-act structure, with each act containing two to five scenes. The play uses alternating scenes to pit the brothers against each other, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create a revolutionary anarchy in the Bohemian Forest.\nSchiller raises many disturbing issues in the play. For instance, he questions the dividing lines between personal liberty and the law and probes the psychology of power, the nature of masculinity and the essential differences between good and evil. He strongly criticizes both the hypocrisies of class and religion and the economic inequities of German society. He also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil.\nSchiller was inspired by the play Julius of Tarent (1774) by Johann Anton Leisewitz, a play Friedrich Schiller considered a favourite.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Robbers, by Frederich Schiller\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It must be admitted as somewhat\ninconsistent that three very remarkable people, whose acts are dependent\non perhaps a thousand contingencies, should be completely developed\nwithin three hours, considering that it would scarcely be possible, in\nthe ordinary course of events, that three such remarkable people should,\neven in twenty-four hours, fully reveal their characters to the most\npenetrating inquirer. A greater amount of incident is here crowded\ntogether than it was possible for me to confine within the narrow limits\nprescribed by Aristotle and Batteux.\n\nIt is, however, not so much the bulk of my play as its contents which\nbanish it from the stage. Its scheme and economy require that several\ncharacters should appear who would offend the finer feelings of virtue\nand shock the delicacy of our manners. Every delineator of human\ncharacter is placed in the same dilemma if he proposes to give a\nfaithful picture of the world as it really is, and not an ideal\nphantasy, a mere creation of his own. It is the course of mortal things\nthat the good should be shadowed by the bad, and virtue shine the\nbrightest when contrasted with vice. Whoever proposes to discourage\nvice and to vindicate religion, morality, and social order against their\nenemies, must unveil crime in all its deformity, and place it before the\neyes of men in its colossal magnitude; he must diligently explore its\ndark mazes, and make himself familiar with sentiments at the wickedness\nof which his soul revolts.\n\nVice is here exposed in its innermost workings. In Francis it resolves\nall the confused terrors of conscience into wild abstractions, destroys\nvirtuous sentiments by dissecting them, and holds up the earnest voice\nof religion to mockery and scorn. He who has gone so far (a distinction\nby no means enviable) as to quicken his understanding at the expense of\nhis soul--to him the holiest things are no longer holy; to him God and\nman are alike indifferent, and both worlds are as nothing. Of such a\nmonster I have endeavored to sketch a striking and lifelike portrait,\nto hold up to abhorrence all the machinery of his scheme of vice, and to\ntest its strength by contrasting it with truth. How far my narrative is\nsuccessful in accomplishing these objects the reader is left to judge.\nMy conviction is that I have painted nature to the life.\n\nNext to this man (Francis) stands another who would perhaps puzzle not\na few of my readers. A mind for which the greatest crimes have only\ncharms through the glory which attaches to them, the energy which their\nperpetration requires, and the dangers which attend them. A remarkable\nand important personage, abundantly endowed with the power of becoming\neither a Brutus or a Catiline, according as that power is directed. An\nunhappy conjunction of circumstances determines him to choose the latter\nfor, his example, and it is only after a fearful straying that he is\nrecalled to emulate the former. Erroneous notions of activity and\npower, an exuberance of strength which bursts through all the barriers\nof law, must of necessity conflict with the rules of social life. To\nthese enthusiast dreams of greatness and efficiency it needed but a\nsarcastic bitterness against the unpoetic spirit of the age to complete\nthe strange Don Quixote whom, in the Robber Moor, we at once detest and\nlove, admire and pity. It is, I hope, unnecessary to remark that I no\nmore hold up this picture as a warning exclusively to robbers than the\ngreatest Spanish satire was levelled exclusively at knight-errants.\n\nIt is nowadays so much the fashion to be witty at the expense of\nreligion that a man will hardly pass for a genius if he does not allow\nhis impious satire to run a tilt at its most sacred truths. The noble\nsimplicity of holy writ must needs be abused and turned into ridicule at\nthe daily assemblies of the so-called wits; for what is there so holy\nand serious that will not raise a laugh if a false sense be attached to\nit? Let me hope that I shall have rendered no inconsiderable service\nto the cause of true religion and morality in holding up these wanton\nmisbelievers to the detestation of society, under the form of the most\ndespicable robbers.\n\nBut still more. I have made these said immoral characters to stand out\nfavorably in particular points, and even in some measure to compensate\nby qualities of the head for what they are deficient in those of the\nheart. Herein I have done no more than literally copy nature. Every\nman, even the most depraved, bears in some degree the impress of the\nAlmighty's image, and perhaps the greatest villain is not farther\nremoved from the most upright man than the petty offender; for the moral\nforces keep even pace with the powers of the mind, and the greater the\ncapacity bestowed on man, the greater and more enormous becomes his\nmisapplication of it; the more responsible is he for his errors.\n\nThe \"Adramelech\" of Klopstock (in his Messiah) awakens in us a feeling\nin which admiration is blended with detestation. We follow Milton's\nSatan with shuddering wonder through the pathless realms of chaos. The\nMedea of the old dramatists is, in spite of all her crimes, a great and\nwondrous woman, and Shakespeare's Richard III. is sure to excite the\nadmiration of the reader, much as he would hate the reality. If it is\nto be my task to portray men as they are, I must at the same time\ninclude their good qualities, of which even the most vicious are never\ntotally destitute. If I would warn mankind against the tiger, I must\nnot omit to describe his glossy, beautifully-marked skin, lest, owing to\nthis omission, the ferocious animal should not be recognized till too\nlate. Besides this, a man who is so utterly depraved as to be without a\nsingle redeeming point is no meet subject for art, and would disgust\nrather than excite the interest of the reader; who would turn over with\nimpatience the pages which concern him. A noble soul can no more endure\na succession of moral discords than the musical ear the grating of\nknives upon glass.\n\nAnd for this reason I should have been ill-advised in attempting to\nbring my drama on the stage. A certain strength of mind is required\nboth on the part of the poet and the reader; in the former that he may\nnot disguise vice, in the latter that he may not suffer brilliant\nqualities to beguile him into admiration of what is essentially\ndetestable. Whether the author has fulfilled his duty he leaves others\nto judge, that his readers will perform theirs he by no means feels\nassured. The vulgar--among whom I would not be understood to mean\nmerely the rabble--the vulgar I say (between ourselves) extend their\ninfluence far around, and unfortunately--set the fashion. Too\nshortsighted to reach my full meaning, too narrow-minded to comprehend\nthe largeness of my views, too disingenuous to admit my moral aim--they\nwill, I fear, almost frustrate my good intentions, and pretend to\ndiscover in my work an apology for the very vice which it has been my\nobject to condemn, and will perhaps make the poor poet, to whom anything\nrather than justice is usually accorded, responsible for his simplicity.\n\nThus we have a _Da capo_ of the old story of Democritus and the\nAbderitans, and our worthy Hippocrates would needs exhaust whole\nplantations of hellebore, were it proposed to remedy this mischief by a\nhealing decoction.\n\n   [This alludes to the fable amusingly recorded by Wieland in his\n   Geschichte der Abderiten. The Abderitans, who were a byword among\n   the ancients for their extreme simplicity, are said to have sent\n   express for Hipocrates to cure their great townsman Democritus,\n   whom they believed to be out of his senses, because his sayings\n   were beyond their comprehension. Hippocrates, on conversing with\n   Democritus, having at once discovered that the cause lay with\n   themselves, assembled the senate and principal inhabitants in the\n   market-place with the promise of instructing them in the cure of\n   Democritus. He then banteringly advised them to import six\n   shiploads of hellebore of the very best quality, and on its arrival\n   to distribute it among the citizens, at least seven pounds per\n   head, but to the senators double that quantity, as they were bound\n   to have an extra supply of sense. By the time these worthies\n   discovered that they had been laughed at, Hippocrates was out of\n   their reach. The story in Wieland is infinitely more amusing than\n   this short quotation from memory enables me to show.  H. G. B.]\n\nLet as many friends of truth as you will, instruct their fellow-citizens\nin the pulpit and on the stage, the vulgar will never cease to be\nvulgar, though the sun and moon may change their course, and \"heaven and\nearth wax old as a garment.\" Perhaps, in order to please tender-hearted\npeople, I might have been less true to nature; but if a certain beetle,\nof whom we have all heard, could extract filth even from pearls, if we\nhave examples that fire has destroyed and water deluged, shall therefore\npearls, fire, and water be condemned. In consequence of the remarkable\ncatastrophe which ends my play, I may justly claim for it a place among\nbooks of morality, for crime meets at last with the punishment it\ndeserves; the lost one enters again within the pale of the law, and\nvirtue is triumphant. Whoever will but be courteous enough towards me\nto read my work through with a desire to understand it, from him I may\nexpect--not that he will admire the poet, but that he will esteem the\nhonest man.\n                     SCHILLER.\nEASTER FAIR, 1781.\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT TO THE ROBBERS.\n\nAS COMMUNICATED BY SCHILLER TO DALBERG IN 1781, AND SUPPOSED TO HAVE\nBEEN USED AS A PROLOGUE.\n\n--This has never before been printed with any of the editions.--\n\nThe picture of a great, misguided soul, endowed with every gift of\nexcellence; yet lost in spite of all its gifts! Unbridled passions and\nbad companionship corrupt his heart, urge him on from crime to crime,\nuntil at last he stands at the head of a band of murderers, heaps horror\nupon horror, and plunges from precipice to precipice into the lowest\ndepths of despair. Great and majestic in misfortune, by misfortune\nreclaimed, and led back to the paths of virtue. Such a man shall you\npity and hate, abhor yet love, in the Robber Moor. You will likewise\nsee a juggling, fiendish knave unmasked and blown to atoms in his own\nmines; a fond, weak, and over-indulgent father; the sorrows of too\nenthusiastic love, and the tortures of ungoverned passion. Here, too,\nyou will witness, not without a shudder, the interior economy of vice;\nand from the stage be taught how all the tinsel of fortune fails to\nsmother the inward worm; and how terror, anguish, remorse, and despair\ntread close on the footsteps of guilt. Let the spectator weep to-day at\nour exhibition, and tremble, and learn to bend his passions to the laws\nof religion and reason; let the youth behold with alarm the consequences\nof unbridled excess; nor let the man depart without imbibing the lesson\nthat the invisible hand of Providence makes even villains the\ninstruments of its designs and judgments, and can marvellously unravel\nthe most intricate perplexities of fate.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\n\nThe eight hundred copies of the first edition of my ROBBERS were\nexhausted before all the admirers of the piece were supplied. A second\nwas therefore undertaken, which has been improved by greater care in\nprinting, and by the omission of those equivocal sentences which were\noffensive to the more fastidious part of the public. Such an\nalteration, however, in the construction of the play as should satisfy\nall the wishes of my friends and critics has not been my object.\n\nIn this second edition the several songs have been arranged for the\npianoforte, which will enhance its value to the musical part of the\npublic. I am indebted for this to an able composer,* who has performed\nhis task in so masterly a manner that the hearer is not unlikely to\nforget the poet in the melody of the musician.\n\n                        DR.

But are you really well, father? You look so pale.\n\nOLD MOOR. Quite well, my son--what have you to tell me?\n\nFRANCIS. The post is arrived--a letter from our correspondent at\nLeipsic.\n\nOLD M. (eagerly). Any tidings of my son Charles?\n\nFRANCIS. Hem! Hem!--Why, yes. But I fear--I know not--whether I dare\n--your health.--Are you really quite well, father?\n\nOLD M. As a fish in water.* Does he write of my son? What means this\nanxiety about my health? You have asked me that question twice.\n\n   [*This is equivalent to our English saying \"As sound as a roach.\"]\n\nFRANCIS. If you are unwell--or are the least apprehensive of being so--\npermit me to defer--I will speak to you at a fitter season.--(Half\naside.) These are no tidings for a feeble frame.\n\nOLD M. Gracious Heavens? what am I doomed to hear?\n\nFRANCIS. First let me retire and shed a tear of compassion for my lost\nbrother. Would that my lips might be forever sealed--for he is your\nson! Would that I could throw an eternal veil over his shame--for he is\nmy brother! But to obey you is my first, though painful, duty--forgive\nme, therefore.\n\nOLD M. Oh, Charles! Charles! Didst thou but know what thorns thou\nplantest in thy father's bosom! That one gladdening report of thee would\nadd ten years to my life! yes, bring back my youth! whilst now, alas,\neach fresh intelligence but hurries me a step nearer to the grave!\n\nFRANCIS. Is it so, old man, then farewell! for even this very day we\nmight all have to tear our hair over your coffin.*\n\n   [* This idiom is very common in Germany, and is used to express\n   affliction.]\n\nOLD M. Stay! There remains but one short step more--let him have his\nwill! (He sits down.) The sins of the father shall be visited unto the\nthird and fourth generation--let him fulfil the decree.\n\nFRANCIS (takes the letter out of his pocket). You know our\ncorrespondent! See! I would give a finger of my right hand might I\npronounce him a liar--a base and slanderous liar! Compose yourself!\nForgive me if I do not let you read the letter yourself. You cannot,\nmust not, yet know all.\n\nOLD M. All, all, my son. You will but spare me crutches.*\n\n   [* _Du ersparst mir die Krucke_; meaning that the contents of the\n   letter can but shorten his declining years, and so spare him the\n   necessity of crutches.]\n\nFRANCIS (reads). \"Leipsic, May 1. Were I not bound by an inviolable\npromise to conceal nothing from you, not even the smallest particular,\nthat I am able to collect, respecting your brother's career, never, my\ndearest friend, should my guiltless pen become an instrument of torture\nto you. I can gather from a hundred of your letters how tidings such as\nthese must pierce your fraternal heart. It seems to me as though I saw\nthee, for the sake of this worthless, this detestable\"--(OLD M. covers\nhis face). Oh! my father, I am only reading you the mildest passages--\n\"this detestable man, shedding a thousand tears.\" Alas! mine flowed--ay,\ngushed in torrents over these pitying cheeks. \"I already picture to\nmyself your aged pious father, pale as death.\" Good Heavens! and so you\nare, before you have heard anything.\n\nOLD M. Go on! Go on!\n\nFRANCIS. \"Pale as death, sinking down on his chair, and cursing the day\nwhen his ear was first greeted with the lisping cry of 'Father!' I have\nnot yet been able to discover all, and of the little I do know I dare\ntell you only a part. Your brother now seems to have filled up the\nmeasure of his infamy. I, at least, can imagine nothing beyond what he\nhas already accomplished; but possibly his genius may soar above my\nconceptions. After having contracted debts to the amount of forty\nthousand ducats, \"--a good round sum for pocket-money, father\" and having\ndishonored the daughter of a rich banker, whose affianced lover, a\ngallant youth of rank, he mortally wounded in a duel, he yesterday, in\nthe dead of night, took the desperate resolution of absconding from the\narm of justice, with seven companions whom he had corrupted to his own\nvicious courses.\" Father? for heaven's sake, father! How do you feel?\n\nOLD M. Enough. No more, my son, no more!\n\nFRANCIS. I will spare your feelings. \"The injured cry aloud for\nsatisfaction. Warrants have been issued for his apprehension--a price\nis set on his head--the name of Moor\"--No, these unhappy lips shall not\nbe guilty of a father's murder (he tears the letter). Believe it not,\nmy father, believe not a syllable.\n\nOLD M. (weeps bitterly). My name--my unsullied name!\n\nFRANCIS (throws himself on his neck). Infamous! most infamous Charles!\nOh, had I not my forebodings, when, even as a boy, he would scamper\nafter the girls, and ramble about over hill and common with ragamuffin\nboys and all the vilest rabble; when he shunned the very sight of a\nchurch as a malefactor shuns a gaol, and would throw the pence he had\nwrung from your bounty into the hat of the first beggar he met, whilst\nwe at home were edifying ourselves with devout prayers and pious\nhomilies? Had I not my misgivings when he gave himself up to reading\nthe adventures of Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and other\nbenighted heathens, in preference to the history of the penitent Tobias?\nA hundred times over have I warned you--for my brotherly affection was\never kept in subjection to filial duty--that this forward youth would\none day bring sorrow and disgrace on us all. Oh that he bore not the\nname of Moor! that my heart beat less warmly for him! This sinful\naffection, which I can not overcome, will one day rise up against me\nbefore the judgment-seat of heaven.\n\nOLD M. Oh! my prospects! my golden dreams!\n\nFRANCIS. Ay, well I knew it. Exactly what I always feared. That fiery\nspirit, you used to say, which is kindling in the boy, and renders him\nso susceptible to impressions of the beautiful and grand--the\ningenuousness which reveals his whole soul in his eyes--the tenderness\nof feeling which melts him into weeping sympathy at every tale of\nsorrow--the manly courage which impels him to the summit of giant oaks,\nand urges him over fosse and palisade and foaming torrents--that\nyouthful thirst of honor--that unconquerable resolution--all those\nresplendent virtues which in the father's darling gave such promise--\nwould ripen into the warm and sincere friend--the excellent citizen--the\nhero--the great, the very great man! Now, mark the result, father; the\nfiery spirit has developed itself--expanded--and behold its precious\nfruits. Observe this ingenuousness--how nicely it has changed into\neffrontery;--this tenderness of soul--how it displays itself in\ndalliance with coquettes, in susceptibility to the blandishments of a\ncourtesan! See this fiery genius, how in six short years it hath burnt\nout the oil of life, and reduced his body to a living skeleton; so that\npassing scoffers point at him with a sneer and exclaim--\"_C'est l'amour\nqui a fait cela_.\" Behold this bold, enterprising spirit--how it\nconceives and executes plans, compared to which the deeds of a Cartouche\nor a Howard sink into insignificance. And presently, when these\nprecious germs of excellence shall ripen into full maturity, what may\nnot be expected from the full development of such a boyhood? Perhaps,\nfather, you may yet live to see him at the head of some gallant band,\nwhich assembles in the silent sanctuary of the forest, and kindly\nrelieves the weary traveller of his superfluous burden. Perhaps you may\nyet have the opportunity, before you go to your own tomb, of making a\npilgrimage to the monument which he may erect for himself, somewhere\nbetween earth and heaven! Perhaps,--oh, father--father, look out for\nsome other name, or the very peddlers and street boys who have seen the\neffigy of your worthy son exhibited in the market-place at Leipsic will\npoint at you with the finger of scorn!\n\nOLD M. And thou, too, my Francis, thou too? Oh, my children, how\nunerringly your shafts are levelled at my heart.\n\nFRANCIS. You see that I too have a spirit; but my spirit bears the\nsting of a scorpion. And then it was \"the dry commonplace, the cold,\nthe wooden Francis,\" and all the pretty little epithets which the\ncontrast between us suggested to your fatherly affection, when he was\nsitting on your knee, or playfully patting your cheeks? \"He would die,\nforsooth, within the boundaries of his own domain, moulder away, and\nsoon be forgotten;\" while the fame of this universal genius would spread\nfrom pole to pole! Ah! the cold, dull, wooden Francis thanks thee,\nheaven, with uplifted hands, that he bears no resemblance to his\nbrother.\n\nOLD M. Forgive me, my child! Reproach not thy unhappy father, whose\nfondest hopes have proved visionary. The merciful God who, through\nCharles, has sent these tears, will, through thee, my Francis, wipe them\nfrom my eyes!\n\nFRANCIS. Yes, father, we will wipe them from your eyes. Your Francis\nwill devote--his life to prolong yours. (Taking his hand with affected\ntenderness.) Your life is the oracle which I will especially consult on\nevery undertaking--the mirror in which I will contemplate everything.\nNo duty so sacred but I am ready to violate it for the preservation of\nyour precious days. You believe me?\n\nOLD M. Great are the duties which devolve on thee, my son--Heaven bless\nthee for what thou has been, and wilt be to me.\n\nFRANCIS. Now tell me frankly, father. Should you not be a happy man,\nwere you not obliged to call this son your own?\n\nOLD M. In mercy, spare me! When the nurse first placed him in my arms,\nI held him up to Heaven and exclaimed, \"Am I not truly blest?\"\n\nFRANCIS. So you said then. Now, have you found it so? You may envy\nthe meanest peasant on your estate in this, that he is not the father of\nsuch a son. So long as you call him yours you are wretched. Your\nmisery will grow with his years--it will lay you in your grave.\n\nOLD M. Oh! he has already reduced me to the decrepitude of fourscore.\n\nFRANCIS. Well, then--suppose you were to disown this son.\n\nOLD M. (startled). Francis! Francis! what hast thou said!\n\nFRANCIS. Is not your love for him the source of all your grief? Root\nout this love, and he concerns you no longer. But for this weak and\nreprehensible affection he would be dead to you;--as though he had never\nbeen born. It is not flesh and blood, it is the heart that makes us\nsons and fathers! Love him no more, and this monster ceases to be your\nson, though he were cut out of your flesh. He has till now been the\napple of your eye; but if thine eye offend you, says Scripture, pluck it\nout. It is better to enter heaven with one eye than hell with two! \"It\nis profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not\nthat thy whole body should be cast into hell.\" These are the words of\nthe Bible!\n\nOLD M. Wouldst thou have me curse my son?\n\nFRANCIS. By no means, father. God forbid! But whom do you call your\nson? Him to whom you have given life, and who in return does his utmost\nto shorten yours.\n\nOLD M. Oh, it is all too true! it is a judgment upon me. The Lord has\nchosen him as his instrument.\n\nFRANCIS. See how filially your bosom child behaves. He destroys you by\nyour own excess of paternal sympathy; murders you by means of the very\nlove you bear him--has coiled round a father's heart to crush it. When\nyou are laid beneath the turf he becomes lord of your possessions, and\nmaster of his own will. That barrier removed, and the torrent of his\nprofligacy will rush on without control. Imagine yourself in his place.\nHow often he must wish his father under ground--and how often, too, his\nbrother--who so unmercifully impede the free course of his excesses.\nBut call you this a requital of love? Is this filial gratitude for a\nfather's tenderness? to sacrifice ten years of your life to the lewd\npleasures of an hour? in one voluptuous moment to stake the honor of an\nancestry which has stood unspotted through seven centuries? Do you call\nthis a son? Answer? Do you call this your son?\n\nOLD M. An undutiful son! Alas! but still my child! my child!\n\nFRANCIS. A most amiable and precious child--whose constant study is to\nget rid of his father. Oh, that you could learn to see clearly! that\nthe film might be removed from your eyes! But your indulgence must\nconfirm him in his vices! your assistance tend to justify them.\nDoubtless you will avert the curse of Heaven from his head, but on your\nown, father--on yours--will it fall with twofold vengeance.\n\nOLD M. Just! most just! Mine, mine be all the guilt!\n\nFRANCIS. How many thousands who have drained the voluptuous bowl of\npleasure to the dregs have been reclaimed by suffering! And is not the\nbodily pain which follows every excess a manifest declaration of the\ndivine will! And shall man dare to thwart this by an impious exercise\nof affection? Shall a father ruin forever the pledge committed to his\ncharge? Consider, father, if you abandon him for a time to the pressure\nof want will not he be obliged to turn from his wickedness and repent?\nOtherwise, untaught even in the great school of adversity, he must\nremain a confirmed reprobate? And then--woe to the father who by a\nculpable tenderness bath frustrated the ordinances of a higher wisdom!\nWell, father?\n\nOLD M. I will write to him that I withdraw my protection.\n\nFRANCIS. That would be wise and prudent.\n\nOLD M. That he must never come into my sight again\n\nFRANCIS. 'Twill have a most salutary effect.\n\nOLD M. (tenderly). Until he reforms.\n\nFRANCIS. Right, quite right. But suppose that he comes disguised in\nthe hypocrite's mask, implores your compassion with tears, and wheedles\nfrom you a pardon, then quits you again on the morrow, and jests at your\nweakness in the arms of his harlot. No, my father! He will return of\nhis own accord, when his conscience awakens him to repentance.\n\nOLD M. I will write to him, on the spot, to that effect.\n\nFRANCIS. Stop, father, one word more. Your just indignation might\nprompt reproaches too severe, words which might break his heart--and\nthen--do you not think that your deigning to write with your own hand\nmight be construed into an act of forgiveness? It would be better, I\nthink, that you should commit the task to me?\n\nOLD M. Do it, my son. Ah! it would, indeed, have broken my heart!\nWrite to him that--\n\nFRANCIS (quickly). That's agreed, then?\n\nOLD M. Say that he has caused me a thousand bitter tears--a thousand\nsleepless nights--but, oh! do not drive my son to despair!\n\nFRANCIS. Had you not better retire to rest, father? This affects you\ntoo strongly.\n\nOLD M. Write to him that a father's heart--But I charge you, drive him\nnot to despair. [Exit in sadness.]\n\nFRANCIS (looking after him with a chuckle). Make thyself easy, old\ndotard! thou wilt never more press thy darling to thy bosom--there is a\ngulf between thee and him impassable as heaven is from hell. He was\ntorn from thy arms before even thou couldst have dreamed it possible to\ndecree the separation. Why, what a sorry bungler should I be had I not\nskill enough to pluck a son from a father's heart; ay, though he were\nriveted there with hooks of steel! I have drawn around thee a magic\ncircle of curses which he cannot overleap. Good speed to thee, Master\nFrancis. Papa's darling is disposed of--the course is clear. I must\ncarefully pick up all the scraps of paper, for how easily might my\nhandwriting be recognized. (He gathers the fragments of the letter.)\nAnd grief will soon make an end of the old gentleman. And as for her--\nI must tear this Charles from her heart, though half her life come with\nhim.\n\nNo small cause have I for being dissatisfied with Dame Nature, and, by\nmy honor, I will have amends! Why did I not crawl the first from my\nmother's womb? why not the only one? why has she heaped on me this\nburden of deformity? on me especially? Just as if she had spawned me\nfrom her refuse.* Why to me in particular this snub of the Laplander?\nthese negro lips? these Hottentot eyes? On my word, the lady seems to\nhave collected from all the race of mankind whatever was loathsome into\na heap, and kneaded the mass into my particular person. Death and\ndestruction! who empowered her to deny to me what she accorded to him?\nCould a man pay his court to her before he was born? or offend her\nbefore he existed? Why went she to work in such a partial spirit?\n\nNo! no! I do her injustice--she bestowed inventive faculty, and set us\nnaked and helpless on the shore of this great ocean, the world--let\nthose swim who can--the heavy** may sink. To me she gave naught else,\nand how to make the best use of my endowment is my present business.\nMen's natural rights are equal; claim is met by claim, effort by effort,\nand force by force--right is with the strongest--the limits of our power\nconstitute our laws.\n\nIt is true there are certain organized conventions, which men have\ndevised to keep up what is called the social compact. Honor! truly a\nvery convenient coin, which those who know how to pass it may lay out\nwith great advantage.*** Conscience! oh yes, a useful scarecrow to\nfrighten sparrows away from cherry-trees; it is something like a fairly\nwritten bill of exchange with which your bankrupt merchant staves off\nthe evil day.\n\n   * See Richard III., Act I, Sc. 1, line 17.\n\n   **Heavy is used in a double meaning; the German word is plump,\n   which Means lumpish clumsy awkward.\n\n   ***So Falstaff, Hen. IV., Pt. I., Act V., Sc. 1, \"Honor is a mere\n   scutcheon.\"\n\nWell! these are all most admirable institutions for keeping fools in\nawe, and holding the mob underfoot, that the cunning may live the more\nat their ease. Rare institutions, doubtless. They are something like\nthe fences my boors plant so closely to keep out the hares--yes\nI' faith, not a hare can trespass on the enclosure, but my lord claps\nspurs to his hunter, and away he gallops over the teeming harvest!\n\nPoor hare! thou playest but a sorry part in this world's drama, but your\nworshipful lords must needs have hares!\n\n   *[This may help to illustrate a passage in Shakespeare which\n   puzzles the commentators--\"Cupid is a good hare-finder.\"--Much ADO,\n   Act I., Sc. 1.\n   The hare, in Germany, is considered an emblem of abject submission\n   and cowardice. The word may also be rendered \"Simpleton,\"\n   \"Sawney,\" or any other of the numerous epithets which imply a soft\n   condition.]\n\nThen courage, and onward, Francis. The man who fears nothing is as\npowerful as he who is feared by everybody. It is now the mode to wear\nbuckles on your smallclothes, that you may loosen or tighten them at\npleasure. I will be measured for a conscience after the newest fashion,\none that will stretch handsomely as occasion may require. Am I to\nblame? It is the tailor's affair? I have heard a great deal of twaddle\nabout the so-called ties of blood--enough to make a sober man beside\nhimself. He is your brother, they say; which interpreted, means that he\nwas manufactured in the same mould, and for that reason he must needs be\nsacred in your eyes! To what absurd conclusions must this notion of a\nsympathy of souls, derived from the propinquity of bodies, inevitably\ntend? A common source of being is to produce community of sentiment;\nidentity of matter, identity of impulse! Then again,--he is thy father!\nHe gave thee life, thou art his flesh and blood--and therefore he must\nbe sacred to thee! Again a most inconsequential deduction! I should\nlike to know why he begot me;** certainly not out of love for me--for I\nmust first have existed!\n\n   **[The reader of Sterne will remember a very similar passage in the\n   first chapter of Tristram Shandy.]\n\nCould he know me before I had being, or did he think of me during my\nbegetting? or did he wish for me at the moment? Did he know what I\nshould be? If so I would not advise him to acknowledge it or I should\npay him off for his feat. Am I to be thankful to him that I am a man?\nAs little as I should have had a right to blame him if he had made me a\nwoman. Can I acknowledge an affection which is not based on any\npersonal regard? Could personal regard be present before the existence\nof its object? In what, then, consists the sacredness of paternity?\nIs it in the act itself out of which existence arose? as though this\nwere aught else than an animal process to appease animal desires. Or\ndoes it lie, perhaps, in the result of this act, which is nothing more\nafter all than one of iron necessity, and which men would gladly\ndispense with, were it not at the cost of flesh and blood? Do I then\nowe him thanks for his affection? Why, what is it but a piece of\nvanity, the besetting sin of the artist who admires his own works,\nhowever hideous they may be? Look you, this is the whole juggle,\nwrapped up in a mystic veil to work on our fears. And shall I, too, be\nfooled like an infant? Up then! and to thy work manfully. I will root\nup from my path whatever obstructs my progress towards becoming the\nmaster. Master I must be, that I may extort by force what I cannot win\nby affection.*\n\n\n   *[This soliloquy in some parts resembles that of Richard, Duke of\n   Gloster, in Shakespeare's Henry VI., Act V. Sc. 6.]\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n       SCENE II.--A Tavern on the Frontier of Saxony.\n\n\n CHARLES VON MOOR intent on a book; SPIEGELBERG drinking at the table.\n\n\n\nCHARLES VON M. (lays the book aside). I am disgusted with this age of\npuny scribblers when I read of great men in my Plutarch.\n\nSPIEGEL. (places a glass before him, and drinks). Josephus is the book\nyou should read.\n\nCHARLES VON M. The glowing spark of Prometheus is burnt out, and now\nthey substitute for it the flash of lycopodium,* a stage-fire which will\nnot so much as light a pipe. The present generation may be compared to\nrats crawling about the club of Hercules.**\n\n\n   *[Lycopodium (in German Barlappen-mehl), vulgarly known as the\n   Devil's Puff-ball or Witchmeal, is used on the stage, as well in\n   England as on the continent, to produce flashes of fire. It is\n   made of the pollen of common club moss, or wolf's claw (Lycopodium\n   clavatum), the capsules of which contain a highly inflammable\n   powder. Translators have uniformly failed in rendering this\n   passage.]\n\n   **[This simile brings to mind Shakespeare's:\n                     \"We petty men\n         Walk under his huge legs, and peep about.\"\n                JULIUS CAESAR, Act I., Sc. 2.]\n\nA French abbe lays it down that Alexander was a poltroon; a phthisicky\nprofessor, holding at every word a bottle of sal volatile to his nose,\nlectures on strength. Fellows who faint at the veriest trifle criticise\nthe tactics of Hannibal; whimpering boys store themselves with phrases\nout of the slaughter at Canna; and blubber over the victories of Scipio,\nbecause they are obliged to construe them.\n\nSPIEGEL. Spouted in true Alexandrian style.\n\nCHARLES VON M. A brilliant reward for your sweat in the battle-field\ntruly to have your existence perpetuated in gymnasiums, and your\nimmortality laboriously dragged about in a schoolboy's satchel. A\nprecious recompense for your lavished blood to be wrapped round\ngingerbread by some Nuremberg chandler, or, if you have great luck, to\nbe screwed upon stilts by a French playwright, and be made to move on\nwires! Ha, ha, ha!\n\nSPIEGEL. (drinks). Read Josephus, I tell you.\n\nCHARLES VON M. Fie! fie upon this weak, effeminate age, fit for nothing\nbut to ponder over the deeds of former times, and torture the heroes of\nantiquity with commentaries, or mangle them in tragedies. The vigor of\nits loins is dried up, and the propagation of the human species has\nbecome dependent on potations of malt liquor.\n\nSPIEGEL. Tea, brother! tea!\n\nCHARLES VON M. They curb honest nature with absurd conventionalities;\nhave scarcely the heart to charge a glass, because they are tasked to\ndrink a health in it; fawn upon the lackey that he may put in a word for\nthem with His Grace, and bully the unfortunate wight from whom they have\nnothing to fear. They worship any one for a dinner, and are just as\nready to poison him should he chance to outbid them for a feather-bed\nat an auction. They damn the Sadducee who fails to come regularly to\nchurch, although their own devotion consists in reckoning up their\nusurious gains at the very altar. They cast themselves on their knees\nthat they may have an opportunity of displaying their mantles, and\nhardly take their eyes off the parson from their anxiety to see how his\nwig is frizzled. They swoon at the sight of a bleeding goose, yet clap\ntheir hands with joy when they see their rival driven bankrupt from the\nExchange. Warmly as I pressed their hands,--\"Only one more day.\" In\nvain! To prison with the dog! Entreaties! Vows! Tears! (stamping\nthe ground). Hell and the devil!\n\nSPIEGEL. And all for a few thousand paltry ducats!\n\nCHARLES VON M. No, I hate to think of it. Am I to squeeze my body into\nstays, and straight-lace my will in the trammels of law. What might\nhave risen to an eagle's flight has been reduced to a snail's pace by\nlaw. Never yet has law formed a great man; 'tis liberty that breeds\ngiants and heroes. Oh! that the spirit of Herman* still glowed in his\nashes!\n\n   *[Herman is the German for Armin or Arminius, the celebrated\n   deliverer of Germany from the Roman yoke. See Menzel's History,\n   vol. i., p. 85, etc.]\n\nSet me at the head of an army of fellows like myself, and out of Germany\nshall spring a republic compared to which Rome and Sparta will be but as\nnunneries. (Rises and flings his sword upon the table.)\n\nSPIEGEL. (jumping up). Bravo! Bravissimo! you are coming to the right\nkey now. I have something for your ear, Moor, which has long been on my\nmind, and you are the very man for it--drink, brother, drink! What if\nwe turned Jews and brought the kingdom of Jerusalem again on the tapis?\nBut tell me is it not a clever scheme? We send forth a manifesto to the\nfour quarters of the world, and summon to Palestine all that do not eat\nSwineflesh. Then I prove by incontestable documents that Herod the\nTetrarch was my direct ancestor, and so forth. There will be a victory,\nmy fine fellow, when they return and are restored to their lands, and\nare able to rebuild Jerusalem. Then make a clean sweep of the Turks out\nof Asia while the iron is hot, hew cedars in Lebanon, build ships, and\nthen the whole nation shall chaffer with old clothes and old lace\nthroughout the world. Meanwhile--\n\nCHARLES VON M. (smiles and takes him by the hand). Comrade! There must\nbe an end now of our fooleries.\n\nSPIEGEL. (with surprise). Fie! you are not going to play the prodigal\nson!--a fellow like you who with his sword has scratched more\nhieroglyhics on other men's faces than three quill-drivers could\ninscribe in their daybooks in a leap-year! Shall I tell you the story\nof the great dog funeral? Ha! I must just bring back your own picture\nto your mind; that will kindle fire in your veins, if nothing else has\npower to inspire you. Do you remember how the heads of the college\ncaused your dog's leg to be shot off, and you, by way of revenge,\nproclaimed a fast through the whole town? They fumed and fretted at\nyour edict. But you, without losing time, ordered all the meat to be\nbought up in Leipsic, so that in the course of eight hours there was not\na bone left to pick all over the place, and even fish began to rise in\nprice. The magistrates and the town council vowed vengeance. But we\nstudents turned out lustily, seventeen hundred of us, with you at our\nhead, and butchers and tailors and haberdashers at our backs, besides\npublicans, barbers, and rabble of all sorts, swearing that the town\nshould be sacked if a single hair of a student's head was injured. And\nso the affair went off like the shooting at Hornberg,* and they were\nobliged to be off with their tails between their legs.\n\n   *[The \"shooting at Hornberg\" is a proverbial expression in Germany\n   for any expedition from which, through lack of courage, the parties\n   retire without firing a shot.]\n\nYou sent for doctors--a whole posse of them--and offered three ducats to\nany one who would write a prescription for your dog. We were afraid the\ngentlemen would stand too much upon honor and refuse, and had already\nmade up our minds to use force. But this was quite unnecessary; the\ndoctors got to fisticuffs for the three ducats, and their competition\nbrought down the price to three groats; in the course of an hour a dozen\nprescriptions were written, of which, of course, the poor beast very\nsoon died.\n\nCHARLES VON M. The vile rascals.\n\nSPIEGEL. The funeral procession was arranged with all due pomp; odes\nfor the dog were indited by the gross; and at night we all turned out,\nnear a thousand of us, a lantern in one hand and our rapier in the\nother, and so proceeded through the town, the bells chiming and ringing,\ntill the dog was entombed. Then came a feed which lasted till broad\ndaylight, when you sent your acknowledgments to the college dons for\ntheir kind sympathy, and ordered the meat to be sold at half-price.\n_Mort de ma vie_, if we had not as great a respect for you as a garrison\nfor the conqueror of a fortress.\n\nCHARLES VON M. And are you not ashamed to boast of these things? Have\nyou not shame enough in you to blush even at the recollection of such\npranks?\n\nSPIEGEL. Come, come! You are no longer the same Moor. Do you remember\nhow, a thousand times, bottle in hand, you made game of the miserly old\ngovernor, bidding him by all means rake and scrape together as much as\nhe could, for that you would swill it all down your throat? Don't you\nremember, eh?--don't you remember?' O you good-for-nothing, miserable\nbraggart! that was speaking like a man, and a gentleman, but--\n\nCHARLES VON M. A curse on you for reminding me of it! A curse on myself\nfor what I said! But it was done in the fumes of wine, and my heart\nknew not what my tongue uttered.\n\nSPIEGEL. (shakes his head). No, no! that cannot be! Impossible,\nbrother! You are not in earnest! Tell me! most sweet brother, is it\nnot poverty which has brought you to this mood? Come! let me tell you a\nlittle story of my youthful days. There was a ditch close to my house,\neight feet wide at the least, which we boys were trying to leap over for\na wager. But it was no go. Splash! there you lay sprawling, amidst\nhisses and roars of laughter, and a relentless shower of snowballs. By\nthe side of my house a hunter's dog was lying chained, a savage beast,\nwhich would catch the girls by their petticoats with the quickness of\nlightning if they incautiously passed too near him. Now it was my\ngreatest delight to tease this brute in every possible way; and it was\nenough to make one burst with laughing to see the beast fix his eyes on\nme with such fierceness that he seemed ready to tear me to pieces if he\ncould but get at me. Well, what happened? Once, when I was amusing\nmyself in this manner, I hit him such a bang in the ribs with a stone\nthat in his fury he broke loose and ran right upon me. I tore away like\nlightning, but--devil take it!--that confounded ditch lay right in my\nway. What was to be done? The dog was close at my heels and quite\nfurious; there was no time to deliberate. I took a spring and cleared\nthe ditch. To that leap I was indebted for life and limb; the beast\nwould have torn me to atoms.\n\nCHARLES VON M. And to what does all this tend?\n\nSPIEGEL. To this--that you may be taught that strength grows with the\noccasion. For which reason I never despair even when things are the\nworst. Courage grows with danger. Powers of resistance increase by\npressure. It is evident by the obstacles she strews in my path that\nfate must have designed me for a great man.\n\nCHARLES VON M. (angrily). I am not aware of anything for which we still\nrequire courage, and have not already shown it.\n\nSPIEGEL. Indeed! And so you mean to let your gifts go to waste? To\nbury your talent? Do you think your paltry achievements at Leipsic\namount to the _ne plus ultra_ of genius? Let us but once get to the\ngreat world--Paris and London! where you get your ears boxed if you\nsalute a man as honest. It is a real jubilee to practise one's\nhandicraft there on a grand scale. How you will stare! How you will\nopen your eyes! to see signatures forged; dice loaded; locks picked,\nand strong boxes gutted; all that you shall learn of Spiegelberg! The\nrascal deserves to be hanged on the first gallows that would rather\nstarve than manipulate with his fingers.\n\nCHARLES VON M. (in a fit of absence). How now? I should not wonder if\nyour proficiency went further still.\n\nSPIEGEL. I begin to think you mistrust me. Only wait till I have grown\nwarm at it; you shall see wonders; your little brain shall whirl clean\nround in your pericranium when my teeming wit is delivered. (He rises\nexcited.) How it clears up within me! Great thoughts are dawning in on\nmy soul! Gigantic plans are fermenting in my creative brain. Cursed\nlethargy (striking his forehead), which has hitherto enchained my\nfaculties, cramped and fettered my prospects! I awake; I feel what I\nam--and what I am to be!\n\nCHARLES VON M. You are a fool! The wine is swaggering in your brain.\n\nSPIEGEL. (more excited). Spiegelberg, they will say, art thou a\nmagician, Spiegelberg? 'Tis a pity, the king will say, that thou wert\nnot made a general, Spiegelberg, thou wouldst have thrust the Austrians\nthrough a buttonhole. Yes, I hear the doctors lamenting, 'tis a crying\nshame that he was not bred to medicine, he would have discovered the\n_elixir vitae_. Ay, and that he did not take to financiering, the\nSullys will deplore in their cabinets,--he would have turned flints into\nlouis-d'ors by his magic. And Spiegelberg will be the word from east to\nwest; then down into the dirt with you, ye cowards, ye reptiles, while\nSpiegelberg soars with outspread wings to the temple of everlasting\nfame.\n\nCHARLES VON M. A pleasant journey to you! I leave you to climb to the\nsummit of glory on the pillars of infamy. In the shade of my ancestral\ngroves, in the arms of my Amelia, a nobler joy awaits me. I have\nalready, last week, written to my father to implore his forgiveness, and\nhave not concealed the least circumstance from him; and where there is\nsincerity there is compassion and help. Let us take leave of each\nother, Moritz. After this day we shall meet no more. The post has\narrived. My father's forgiveness must already be within the walls of\nthis town.\n\n\n     Enter SCHWEITZER, GRIMM, ROLLER, SCHUFTERLE, and RAZMAN.\n\n\nROLLER. Are you aware that they are on our track!\n\nGRIMM. That we are not for a moment safe from being taken?\n\nCHARLES VON M. I don't wonder at it. It must be as it will! Have none\nof you seen Schwarz? Did he say anything about having a letter for me?\n\nROLLER. He has been long in search of you on some such errand, I\nsuspect.\n\nCHARLES VON M. Where is he? where, where? (is about to rush off in\nhaste).\n\nROLLER. Stay! we have appointed him to come here. You tremble?\n\nCHARLES VON M. I do not tremble. Why should I tremble? Comrades, this\nletter--rejoice with me! I am the happiest man under the sun; why\nshould I tremble?\n\n\n               Enter SCHWARZ.\n\n\nCHARLES VON M. (rushes towards him). Brother, brother! the letter, the\nletter!\n\nSCHW. (gives him a letter, which he opens hastily). What's the matter?\nYou have grown as pale as a whitewashed wall!\n\nCHARLES VON M. My brother's hand!\n\nSCHW. What the deuce is Spiegelberg about there?\n\nGRIMM. The fellow's mad. He jumps about as if he had St. Vitus' dance.\n\nSCHUF. His wits are gone a wool gathering! He's making verses, I'll be\nsworn!\n\nRAZ. Spiegelberg! Ho! Spiegelberg! The brute does not hear.\n\nGRIMM. (shakes him). Hallo! fellow! are you dreaming? or--\n\nSPIEGEL. (who has all this time been making gestures in a corner of the\nroom, as if working out some great project, jumps up wildly). Your\nmoney or your life! (He catches SCHWEITZER by the throat, who very\ncoolly flings him against the wall; Moor drops the letter and rushes\nout. A general sensation.)\n\nROLLER. (calling after him). Moor! where are you going? What's the\nmatter?\n\nGRIMM. What ails him? What has he been doing? He is as pale as death.\n\nSCHW. He must have got strange news. Just let us see!\n\nROLLER. (picks up the letter from the ground, and reads). \"Unfortunate\nbrother!\"--a pleasant beginning--\"I have only briefly to inform you that\nyou have nothing more to hope for. You may go, your father directs me\nto tell you, wherever your own vicious propensities lead. Nor are you\nto entertain, he says, any hope of ever gaining pardon by weeping at his\nfeet, unless you are prepared to fare upon bread and water in the lowest\ndungeon of his castle until your hair shall outgrow eagles' feathers,\nand your nails the talons of a vulture. These are his very words. He\ncommands me to close the letter. Farewell forever! I pity you.\n\n                         \"FRANCIS VON MOOR\"\n\n\nSCHW. A most amiable and loving brother, in good truth! And the\nscoundrel's name is Francis.\n\nSPIEGEL. (slinking forward). Bread and water! Is that it? A\ntemperate diet! But I have made a better provision for you. Did I not\nsay that I should have to think for you all at last?\n\nSCHWEIT. What does the blockhead say! The jackass is going to think\nfor us all!\n\nSPIEGEL. Cowards, cripples, lame dogs are ye all if you have not\ncourage enough to venture upon something great.\n\nROLLER. Well, of course, so we should be, you are right; but will your\nproposed scheme get us out of this devil of a scrape? eh?\n\nSPIEGEL. (with a proud laugh). Poor thing! Get us out of this scrape?\nHa, ha, ha! Get us out of the scrape!--and is that all your thimbleful\nof brain can reach? And with that you trot your mare back to the\nstable? Spiegelberg would have been a miserable bungler indeed if that\nwere the extent of his aim. Heroes, I tell you, barons, princes, gods,\nit will make of you.\n\nRAZ. That's pretty well for one bout, truly! But no doubt it is some\nneck-breaking piece of business; it will cost a head or so at the least.\n\nSPIEGEL. It wants nothing but courage; as to the headwork, I take that\nentirely upon myself. Courage, I say, Schweitzer! Courage, Roller!\nGrimm! Razman! Schufterle! Courage!\n\nSCHW. Courage! If that is all, I have courage enough to walk through\nhell barefoot.\n\nSCHUFT. And I courage enough to fight the very devil himself under the\nopen gallows for the rescue of any poor sinner.\n\nSPIEGEL. That's just what it should be! If ye have courage, let any\none of you step forward and say he has still something to lose, and not\neverything to gain?\n\nSCHW. Verily, I should have a good deal to lose, if I were to lose all\nthat I have yet to win!\n\nPAZ. Yes, by Jove! and I much to win, if I could win all that I have\nnot got to lose.\n\nSCHUFT. Were I to lose what I carry on my back on trust I should at any\nrate have nothing to lose on the morrow.\n\nSPIEGEL. Very well then! (He takes his place in the middle of them,\nand says in solemn adjuration)--if but a drop of the heroic blood of the\nancient Germans still flow in your veins--come! We will fix our abode\nin the Bohemian forests, draw together a band of robbers, and--What are\nyou gaping at? Has your slender stock of courage oozed out already?\n\nROLLER. You are not the first rogue by many that has defied the\ngallows;--and yet what other choice have we?\n\nSPIEGEL. Choice? You have no choice. Do you want to lie rotting in\nthe debtor's jail and beat hemp till you are bailed by the last trumpet?\nWould you toil with pick-axe and spade for a morsel of dry bread? or\nearn a pitiful alms by singing doleful ditties under people's windows?\nOr will you be sworn at the drumhead--and then comes the question,\nwhether anybody would trust your hang-dog visages--and so under the\nsplenetic humor of some despotic sergeant serve your time of purgatory\nin advance? Would you like to run the gauntlet to the beat of the drum?\nor be doomed to drag after you, like a galley-slave, the whole iron\nstore of Vulcan? Behold your choice. You have before you the complete\ncatalogue of all that you may choose from!\n\nROLLER. Spiegelberg is not altogether wrong! I, too, have been\nconcocting plans, but they come much to the same thing. How would it\nbe, thought I, were we to club our wits together, and dish up a\npocketbook, or an almanac, or something of that sort, and write reviews\nat a penny a line, as is now the fashion?\n\nSCHUFT. The devil's in you! you are pretty nearly hitting on my own\nschemes. I have been thinking to myself how would it answer were I to\nturn Methodist, and hold weekly prayer-meetings?\n\nGRIMM. Capital! and, if that fails, turn atheist! We might fall foul of\nthe four Gospels, get our book burned by the hangman, and then it would\nsell at a prodigious rate.\n\nRAZ. Or we might take the field to cure a fashionable ailment. I know\na quack doctor who has built himself a house with nothing but mercury,\nas the motto over his door implies.\n\nSCHWEIT. (rises and holds out his hand to Spiegelberg). Spiegelberg,\nthou art a great man! or else a blind hog has by chance found an acorn.\n\nSCHW. Excellent schemes! Honorable professions! How great minds\nsympathize! All that seems wanting to complete the list is that we\nshould turn pimps and bawds.\n\nSPIEGEL. Pooh! Pooh! Nonsense. And what is to prevent our combining\nmost of these occupations in one person? My plan will exalt you the\nmost, and it holds out glory and immortality into the bargain.\nRemember, too, ye sorry varlets, and it is a matter worthy of\nconsideration: one's fame hereafter--the sweet thought of immortality--\n\nROLLER. And that at the very head of the muster-roll of honorable\nnames! You are a master of eloquence, Spiegelberg, when the question is\nhow to convert an honest man into a scoundrel. But does any one know\nwhat has become of Moor?\n\nSPIEGEL. Honest, say you? Do you think you'll be less honest then than\nyou are now? What do you call honest? To relieve rich misers of half\nof those cares which only scare golden sleep from their eyelids; to\nforce hoarded coin into circulation; to restore the equalization of\nproperty; in one word, to bring back the golden age; to relieve\nProvidence of many a burdensome pensioner, and so save it the trouble of\nsending war, pestilence, famine, and above all, doctors--that is what I\ncall honesty, d'ye see; that's what I call being a worthy instrument in\nthe hand of Providence,--and then, at every meal you eat, to have the\nsweet reflection: this is what thy own ingenuity, thy lion boldness, thy\nnight watchings, have procured for thee--to command the respect both of\ngreat and small!\n\nROLLER. And at last to mount towards heaven in the living body, and in\nspite of wind and storm, in spite of the greedy maw of old father Time,\nto be hovering beneath the sun and moon and all the stars of the\nfirmament, where even the unreasoning birds of heaven, attracted by\nnoble instinct, chant their seraphic music, and angels with tails hold\ntheir most holy councils? Don't you see? And, while monarchs and\npotentates become a prey to moths and worms, to have the honor of\nreceiving visits from the royal bird of Jove. Moritz, Moritz, Moritz!\nbeware of the three-legged beast.*\n\n   *[The gallows, which in Germany is formed of three posts.]\n\nSPIEGEL. And does that fright thee, craven-heart? Has not many a\nuniversal genius, who might have reformed the world, rotted upon the\ngallows? And does not the renown of such a man live for hundreds and\nthousands of years, whereas many a king and elector would be passed over\nin history, were not historians obliged to give him a niche to complete\nthe line of succession, or that the mention of him did not swell the\nvolume a few octavo pages, for which he counts upon hard cash from the\npublisher. And when the wayfarer sees you swinging to and fro in the\nbreeze he will mutter to himself, \"That fellow's brains had no water in\nthem, I'll warrant me,\" and then groan over the hardship of the times.\n\nSCHWEIT. (slaps him on the shoulder). Well said, Spiegelberg! Well\nsaid! Why the devil do we stand here hesitating?\n\nSCHW. And suppose it is called disgrace--what then? Cannot one, in\ncase of need, always carry a small powder about one, which quietly\nsmooths the weary traveller's passage across the Styx, where no\ncock-crowing will disturb his rest? No, brother Moritz! Your scheme is\ngood; so at least says my creed.\n\nSCHUFT. Zounds! and mine too! Spiegelberg, I am your recruit.\n\nRAZ. Like a second Orpheus, Spiegelberg, you have charmed to sleep that\nhowling beast, conscience! Take me as I stand, I am yours entirely!\n\nGRIMMM. _Si omnes consentiunt ego non dissentio_;* mind, without a\ncomma. There is an auction going on in my head--methodists--quack\ndoctors--reviewers--rogues;--the highest bidder has me. Here is my\nhand, Moritz!\n\n   *[The joke is explained by placing a comma after non.]\n\nROLLER. And you too, Schweitzer? (he gives his right hand to\nSPIEGELBERG). Thus I consign my soul to the devil.\n\nSPIEGEL. And your name to the stars! What does it signify where the\nsoul goes to? If crowds of _avantcouriers_ give notice of our descent\nthat the devils may put on their holiday gear, wipe the accumulated soot\nof a thousand years from their eyelashes, and myriads of horned heads\npop up from the smoking mouth of their sulphurous chimneys to welcome\nour arrival! 'Up, comrades! (leaping up). Up! What in the world is\nequal to this ecstacy of delight? Come along, comrades!\n\nROLLER. Gently, gently! Where are you going? Every beast must have a\nhead, boys!\n\nSPIEGEL. (With bitterness). What is that incubus preaching about? Was\nnot the head already there before a single limb began to move? Follow\nme, comrades!\n\nROLLER. Gently, I say! even liberty must have its master. Rome and\nSparta perished for want of a chief.\n\nSPIEGEL. (in a wheedling manner). Yes,--stay--Roller is right. And he\nmust have an enlightened head. Do you understand? A keen, politic\nhead. Yes! when I think what you were only an hour ago, and what you\nare now, and that it is all owing to one happy thought. Yes, of course,\nyou must have a chief, and you'll own that he who struck out this idea\nmay claim to have an enlightened and politic head?\n\nROLLER. If one could hope, if one could dream, but I fear he will not\nconsent.\n\nSPIEGEL. Why not? Speak out boldly, friend! Difficult as it may be to\nsteer a laboring vessel against wind and tide, oppressive as may be the\nweight of a crown, speak your thought without hesitation, Roller!\nPerhaps he may be prevailed upon after all!\n\nROLLER. And if he does not the whole vessel will be crazy enough.\nWithout Moor we are a \"body without a soul.\"\n\nSPIEGEL. (turning angrily from him). Dolt! blockhead!\n\n\n   (Enter CHARLES VON MOOR in violent agitation, stalking backwards\n   and forwards, and speaking to himself.)\n\n\nCHARLES VON M. Man--man! false, perfidious crocodile-brood! Your eyes\nare all tears, but your hearts steel! Kisses on your lips, but daggers\ncouched in your bosoms! Even lions and tigers nourish their young.\nRavens feast their brood on carrion, and he--he Malice I have learned to\nbear; and I can smile when my fellest enemy drinks to me in my own\nheart's blood; but when kindred turn traitors, when a father's love\nbecomes a fury's hate; oh, then, let manly resignation give place to\nraging fire! the gentle lamb become a tiger! and every nerve strain\nitself to vengeance and destruction!\n\nROLLER. Hark ye, Moor! What think ye of it? A robber's life is\npleasanter, after all, than to lie rotting on bread and water in the\nlowest dungeon of the castle?\n\nCHARLES VON M. Why was not this spirit implanted in a tiger which gluts\nits raging jaws with human flesh? Is this a father's tenderness? Is\nthis love for love? Would I were a bear to rouse all the bears of the\nnorth against this murderous race! Repentance, and no pardon! Oh, that\nI could poison the ocean that men might drink death from every spring!\nContrition, implicit reliance, and no pardon!\n\nROLLER. But listen, Moor,--listen to what I am telling you!\n\nCHARLES VON M. 'Tis incredible! 'tis a dream--a delusion! Such earnest\nentreaty, such a vivid picture of misery and tearful penitence--a savage\nbeast would have been melted to compassion! stones would have wept, and\nyet he--it would be thought a malicious libel upon human nature were I\nto proclaim it--and yet, yet--oh, that I could sound the trumpet of\nrebellion through all creation, and lead air, and earth, and sea into\nbattle array against this generation of hyenas!\n\nGRIMM. Hear me, only hear me! You are deaf with raving.\n\nCHARLES VON M. Avaunt, avaunt! Is not thy name man? Art thou not born\nof woman? Out of my sight, thou thing with human visage! I loved him\nso unutterably!--never son so loved a father; I would have sacrificed a\nthousand lives for him (foaming and stamping the ground). Ha! where is\nhe that will put a sword into my hand that I may strike this generation\nof vipers to the quick! Who will teach me how to reach their heart's\ncore, to crush, to annihilate the whole race? Such a man shall be my\nfriend, my angel, my god--him will I worship!\n\nROLLER. Such friends behold in us; be but advised!\n\nSCHW. Come with us into the Bohemian forests! We will form a band of\nrobbers there, and you (MOOR stares at him).\n\nSCHWEIT. You shall be our captain! you must be our captain!\n\nSPIEGEL. (throws himself into a chair in a rage). Slaves and cowards!\n\nCHARLES VON M. Who inspired thee with that thought? Hark, fellow!\n(grasping ROLLER tightly) that human soul of thine did not produce it;\nwho suggested it to thee? Yes, by the thousand arms of death! that's\nwhat we will, and what we must do! the thought's divine. He who\nconceived it deserves to be canonized. Robbers and murderers! As my\nsoul lives, I am your captain!\n\nALL (with tumultuous shouts). Hurrah! long live our captain!\n\nSPIEGEL. (starting up, aside). Till I give him his _coup de grace_!\n\nCHARLES VON M. See, it falls like a film from my eyes! What a fool was\nI to think of returning to be caged? My soul's athirst for deeds, my\nspirit pants for freedom. Murderers, robbers! with these words I\ntrample the law underfoot--mankind threw off humanity when I appealed to\nit. Away, then, with human sympathies and mercy! I no longer have a\nfather, no longer affections; blood and death shall teach me to forget\nthat anything was ever dear to me! Come! come! Oh, I will recreate\nmyself with some most fearful vengeance;--'tis resolved, I am your\ncaptain! and success to him who Shall spread fire and slaughter the\nwidest and most savagely--I pledge myself He shall be right royally\nrewarded. Stand around me, all of you, and swear to me fealty and\nobedience unto death! Swear by this trusty right hand.\n\nALL (place their hands in his). We swear to thee fealty and obedience\nunto death!\n\nCHARLES VON M. And, by this same trusty right Hand, I here swear to you\nto remain your captain, true and faithful unto death! This arm shall\nmake an instant corpse of him who doubts, or fears, or retreats. And\nmay the same befall me from your hands if I betray my oath! Are you\ncontent?\n\n\n   [SPIEGELBERG runs up and down in a furious rage.]\n\n\nALL (throwing up their hats). We are content!\n\nCHARLES VON M. Well, then, let us be gone! Fear neither death nor\ndanger, for an unalterable destiny rules over us. Every man has his\ndoom, be it to die on the soft pillow of down, or in the field of blood,\nor on the scaffold, or the wheel! One or the other of these must be our\nlot! [Exeunt.]\n\nSPIEGEL. (looking after them after a pause). Your catalogue has a hole\nin it. You have omitted poison.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n       SCENE III.--MOOR'S Castle.--AMELIA'S Chamber.\n\n               FRANCIS, AMELIA.\n\nFRANCIS. Your face is averted from me, Amelia? Am I less worthy than\nhe who is accursed of his father?\n\nAMELIA. Away! Oh! what a loving, compassionate father, who abandons\nhis son a prey to wolves and monsters! In his own comfortable home he\npampers himself with delicious wines and stretches his palsied limbs on\ndown, while his noble son is starving. Shame upon you, inhuman\nwretches! Shame upon you, ye souls of dragons, ye blots on humanity!--\nhis only son!\n\nFRANCIS. I thought he had two.\n\nAMELIA. Yes, he deserves to have such sons as you are. On his deathbed\nhe will in vain stretch out his withered hands for his Charles, and\nrecoil with a shudder when he feels the ice-cold hand of his Francis.\nOh, it is sweet, deliciously sweet, to be cursed by such a father! Tell\nme, Francis, dear brotherly soul--tell me what must one do to be cursed\nby him?\n\nFRANCIS. You are raving, dearest; you are to be pitied.\n\nAMELIA. Oh! indeed. Do you pity your brother? No, monster, you hate\nhim! I hope you hate me too.\n\nFRANCIS. I love you as dearly as I love myself, Amelia!\n\nAMELIA. If you love me you will not refuse me one little request.\n\nFRANCIS. None, none! if you ask no more than my life.\n\nAMELIA. Oh, if that is the case! then one request, which you will so\neasily, so readily grant. (Loftily.) Hate me! I should perforce blush\ncrimson if, whilst thinking of Charles, it should for a moment enter my\nmind that you do not hate me. You promise me this? Now go, and leave\nme; I so love to be alone!\n\nFRANCIS. Lovely enthusiast! how greatly I admire your gentle,\naffectionate heart. Here, here, Charles reigned sole monarch, like a\ngod within his temple; he stood before thee waking, he filled your\nimaination dreaming; the whole creation seemed to thee to centre in\nCharles, and to reflect him alone; it gave thee no other echo but of\nhim.\n\nAMELIA (with emotion). Yes, verily, I own it. Despite of you all,\nbarbarians as you are, I will own it before all the world. I love him!\n\nFRANCIS. Inhuman, cruel! So to requite a love like this! To forget\nher--\n\nAMELIA (starting). What! forget me?\n\nFRANCIS. Did you not place a ring on his finger?--a diamond ring, the\npledge of your love? To be sure how is it possible for youth to resist\nthe fascinations of a wanton? Who can blame him for it, since he had\nnothing else left to give away? and of course she repaid him with\ninterest by her caresses and embraces.\n\nAMELIA (with indignation). My ring to a wanton?\n\nFRANCIS. Fie, fie! it is disgraceful. 'Twould not be much, however, if\nthat were all. A ring, be it ever so costly, is, after all, a thing\nwhich one may always buy of a Jew. Perhaps the fashion of it did not\nplease him, perhaps he exchanged it for one more beautiful.\n\nAMELIA (with violence). But my ring, I say, my ring?\n\nFRANCIS. Even yours, Amelia. Ha! such a brilliant, and on my finger;\nand from Amelia! Death itself should not have plucked it hence. It is\nnot the costliness of the diamond, not the cunning of the pattern--it is\nlove which constitutes its value. Is it not so, Amelia? Dearest child,\nyou are weeping. Woe be to him who causes such precious drops to flow\nfrom those heavenly eyes; ah, and if you knew all, if you could but see\nhim yourself, see him under that form?\n\nAMELIA. Monster! what do you mean? What form do you speak of?\n\nFRANCIS. Hush, hush, gentle soul, press me no further (as if\nsoliloquizing, yet aloud). If it had only some veil, that horrid vice,\nunder which it might shroud itself from the eye of the world! But there\nit is, glaring horribly through the sallow, leaden eye; proclaiming\nitself in the sunken, deathlike look; ghastly protruding bones; the\nfaltering, hollow voice; preaching audibly from the shattered, shaking\nskeleton; piercing to the most vital marrow of the bones, and sapping\nthe manly strength of youth--faugh! the idea sickens me. Nose, eyes,\nears shrink from it. You saw that miserable wretch, Amelia, in our\nhospital, who was heavily breathing out his spirit; modesty seemed to\ncast down her abashed eye as she passed him; you cried woe upon him.\nRecall that hideous image to your mind, and your Charles stands before\nyou. His kisses are pestilence, his lips poison.\n\nAMELIA (strikes him). Shameless liar!\n\nFRANCIS. Does such a Charles inspire you with horror? Does the mere\npicture fill you with disgust? Go, then! gaze upon him yourself, your\nhandsome, your angelic, your divine Charles! Go, drink his balmy\nbreath, and revel in the ambrosial fumes which ascend from his throat!\nThe very exhalations of his body will plunge you into that dark and\ndeathlike dizziness which follows the smell of a bursting carcase, or\nthe sight of a corpse-strewn battle-field. (AMELIA turns away her\nface.) What sensations of love! What rapture in those embraces! But is\nit not unjust to condemn a man because of his diseased exterior? Even\nin the most wretched lump of deformity a soul great and worthy of love\nmay beam forth brightly like a pearl on a dunghill. ( With a malignant\nsmile.) Even from lips of corruption love may----. To be sure if vice\nshould undermine the very foundations of character, if with chastity\nvirtue too should take her flight as the fragrance departs from the\nfaded rose--if with the body the soul too should be tainted and\ncorrupted.\n\nAMELIA (rising joyfully). Ha! Charles! now I recognize thee again!\nThou art whole, whole! It was all a lie! Dost thou not know,\nmiscreant, that it would be impossible for Charles to be the being you\ndescribe? (FRANCIS remains standing for some time, lost in thought,\nthen suddenly turns round to go away.) Whither are you going in such\nhaste? Are you flying from your own infamy?\n\nFRANCIS (hiding his face). Let me go, let me go! to give free vent to\nmy tears! tyrannical father, thus to abandon the best of your sons to\nmisery and disgrace on every side! Let me go, Amelia! I will throw\nmyself at his feet, on my knees I will conjure him to transfer to me the\ncurse that he has pronounced, to disinherit me, to hate me, my blood, my\nlife, my all----.\n\nAMELIA (falls on his neck). Brother of my Charles! Dearest, most\nexcellent Francis!\n\nFRANCIS. Oh, Amelia! how I love you for this unshaken constancy to my\nbrother. Forgive me for venturing to subject your love to so severe a\ntrial! How nobly you have realized my wishes! By those tears, those\nsighs, that divine indignation--and for me too, for me--our souls did so\ntruly harmonize.\n\nAMELIA. Oh, no! that they never did!\n\nFRANCIS. Alas! they harmonized so truly that I always thought we must\nbe twins. And were it not for that unfortunate difference in person, to\nbe twin-like, which, it must be admitted, would be to the disadvantage\nof Charles, we should again and again be mistaken for each other. Thou\nart, I often said to myself, thou art the very Charles, his echo, his\ncounterpart.\n\nAMELIA (shakes her head). No, no! by that chaste light of heaven! not\nan atom of him, not the least spark of his soul.\n\nFRANCIS. So entirely the same in our dispositions; the rose was his\nfavorite flower, and what flower do I esteem above the rose? He loved\nmusic beyond expression; and ye are witnesses, ye stars! how often you\nhave listened to me playing on the harpsichord in the dead silence of\nnight, when all around lay buried in darkness and slumber; and how is it\npossible for you, Amelia, still to doubt? if our love meets in one\nperfection, and if it is the self-same love, how can its fruits\ndegenerate? (AMELIA looks at him with astonishment.) It was a calm,\nserene evening, the last before his departure for Leipzic, when he took\nme with him to the bower where you so often sat together in dreams of\nlove,--we were long speechless; at last he seized my hand, and said, in\na low voice, and with tears in his eyes, \"I am leaving Amelia; I know\nnot, but I have a sad presentiment that it is forever; forsake her not,\nbrother; be her friend, her Charles--if Charles--should never--never\nreturn.\" (He throws himself down before her, and kisses her hand with\nfervor.) Never, never, never will he return; and I stand pledged by a\nsacred oath to fulfil his behest!\n\nAMELIA (starting back). Traitor! Now thou art unmasked! In that very\nbower he conjured me, if he died, to admit no other love. Dost thou see\nhow impious, how execrable----. Quit my sight!\n\nFRANCIS. You know me not, Amelia; you do not know me in the least!\n\nAMELIA. Oh, yes, I know you; from henceforth I know you; and you\npretend to be like him? You mean to say that he wept for me in your\npresence? Yours? He would sooner have inscribed my name on the\npillory? Begone--this instant!\n\nFRANCIS. You insult me.\n\nAMELIA. Go--I say. You have robbed me of a precious hour; may it be\ndeducted from your life.\n\nFRANCIS. You hate me then!\n\nAMELIA. I despise you--away!\n\nFRANCIS (stamping with fury). Only wait! you shall learn to tremble\nbefore me!--To sacrifice me for a beggar!\n                      [Exit in anger.]\n\nAMELIA. Go, thou base villain! Now, Charles, am I again thine own.\nBeggar, did he say! then is the world turned upside down, beggars are\nkings, and kings are beggars! I would not change the rags he wears for\nthe imperial purple. The look with which he begs must, indeed, be a\nnoble, a royal look, a look that withers into naught the glory, the\npomp, the triumphs of the rich and great! Into the dust with thee,\nglittering baubles! (She tears her pearls from her neck.) Let the rich\nand the proud be condemned to bear the burden of gold, and silver, and\njewels! Be they condemned to carouse at the tables of the voluptuous!\nTo pamper their limbs on the downy couch of luxury! Charles! Charles!\nThus am I worthy of thee!\n                      [Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n                 ACT II.\n\n    SCENE I.--FRANCIS VON MOOR in his chamber--in meditation.\n\nFRANCIS. It lasts too long-and the doctor even says is recovering--an\nold man's life is a very eternity! The course would be free and plain\nbefore me, but for this troublesome, tough lump of flesh, which, like\nthe infernal demon-hound in ghost stories, bars the way to my treasures.\n\nMust, then, my projects bend to the iron yoke of a mechanical system?\nIs my soaring spirit to be chained down to the snail's pace of matter?\nTo blow out a wick which is already flickering upon its last drop of\noil--'tis nothing more. And yet I would rather not do it myself, on\naccount of what the world would say. I should not wish him to be\nkilled, but merely disposed of. I should like to do what your clever\nphysician does, only the reverse way--not stop Nature's course by\nrunning a bar across her path, but only help her to speed a little\nfaster. Are we not able to prolong the conditions of life? Why,\nthen, should we not also be able to shorten them? Philosophers and\nphysiologists teach us how close is the sympathy between the emotions of\nthe mind and the movements of the bodily machine. Convulsive sensations\nare always accompanied by a disturbance of the mechanical vibrations--\npassions injure the vital powers--an overburdened spirit bursts its\nshell. Well, then--what if one knew how to smooth this unbeaten path,\nfor the easier entrance of death into the citadel of life?--to work the\nbody's destruction through the mind--ha! an original device!--who can\naccomplish this?--a device without a parallel! Think upon it, Moor!\nThat were an art worthy of thee for its inventor. Has not poisoning\nbeen raised almost to the rank of a regular science, and Nature\ncompelled, by the force of experiments, to define her limits, so that\none may now calculate the heart's throbbings for years in advance, and\nsay to the beating pulse, \"So far, and no farther\"? Why should not one\ntry one's skill in this line?*\n\n   *[A woman in Paris, by means of a regularly performed series of\n   experiments, carried the art of poisoning to such perfection that\n   she could predict almost to a certainty the day of death, however\n   remote. Fie upon our physicians, who should blush to be outdone by\n   a woman in their own province. Beckmann, in his article on secret\n   poisoning, has given a particular account of this woman, the\n   Marchioness de Brinvilliers.--See \"History of Inventions,\" Standard\n   Library Edition, vol. i, pp. 47-63.]\n\nAnd how, then, must I, too, go to work to dissever that sweet and\npeaceful union of soul and body? What species of sensations should I\nseek to produce? Which would most fiercely assail the condition of\nlife? Anger?--that ravenous wolf is too quickly satiated. Care? that\nworm gnaws far too slowly. Grief?--that viper creeps too lazily for me.\nFear?--hope destroys its power. What! and are these the only\nexecutioners of man? is the armory of death so soon exhausted? (In deep\nthought.) How now! what! ho! I have it! (Starting up.) Terror! What\nis proof against terror? What powers have religion and reason under\nthat giant's icy grasp! And yet--if he should withstand even this\nassault? If he should! Oh, then, come Anguish to my aid! and thou,\ngnawing Repentance!--furies of hell, burrowing snakes who regorge your\nfood, and feed upon your own excrements; ye that are forever destroying,\nand forever reproducing your poison! And thou, howling Remorse, that\ndesolatest thine own habitation, and feedest upon thy mother. And come\nye, too, gentle Graces, to my aid; even you, sweet smiling Memory,\ngoddess of the past--and thou, with thy overflowing horn of plenty,\nblooming Futurity; show him in your mirror the joys of Paradise, while\nwith fleeting foot you elude his eager grasp. Thus will I work my\nbattery of death, stroke after stroke, upon his fragile body, until the\ntroop of furies close upon him with Despair! Triumph! triumph!--the\nplan is complete--difficult and masterly beyond compare--sure--safe; for\nthen (with a sneer) the dissecting knife can find no trace of wound or\nof corrosive poison.\n\n(Resolutely.) Be it so! (Enter HERMANN.) Ha! _Deus ex machina_!\nHermann!\n\nHERMANN. At your service, gracious sir!\n\nFRANCIS (shakes him by the hand). You will not find it that of an\nungrateful master.\n\nHERMANN. I have proofs of this.\n\nFRANCIS. And you shall have more soon--very soon, Hermann!--I have\nsomething to say to thee, Hermann.\n\nHERMANN. I am all attention.\n\nFRANCIS. I know thee--thou art a resolute fellow--a man of mettle.--To\ncall thee smooth-tongued! My father has greatly belied thee, Hermann.\n\nHERMANN. The devil take me if I forget it!\n\nFRANCIS. Spoken like a man! Vengeance becomes a manly heart! Thou art\nto my mind, Hermann. Take this purse, Hermann. It should be heavier\nwere I master here.\n\nHERMANN. That is my unceasing wish, most gracious sir. I thank you.\n\nFRANCIS. Really, Hermann! dost thou wish that I were master? But my\nfather has the marrow of a lion in his bones, and I am but a younger\nson.\n\nHERMANN. I wish you were the eldest son, and that your father were as\nmarrowless as a girl sinking in a consumption.\n\nFRANCIS. Ha! how that elder son would recompense thee! How he would\nraise thee from this grovelling condition, so ill suited to thy spirit\nand noble birth, to be a light of the age!--Then shouldst thou be\ncovered with gold from head to foot, and dash through the streets four\nin hand--verily thou shouldst!--But I am losing sight of what I meant to\nsay.--Have you already forgotten the Lady Amelia, Hermann?\n\nHERMANN. A curse upon it! Why do you remind me of her?\n\nFRANCIS. My brother has filched her away from you.\n\nHERMANN. He shall rue it.\n\nFRANCIS. She gave you the sack. And, if I remember right, he kicked\nyou down stairs.\n\nHERMANN. For which I will kick him into hell.\n\nFRANCIS. He used to say, it was whispered abroad, that your father\ncould never look upon you without smiting his breast and sighing,\n\"God be merciful to me, a sinner!\"\n\nHERMANN (wildly). Thunder and lightning! No more of this!\n\nFRANCIS. He advised you to sell your patent of nobility by auction, and\nto get your stockings mended with the proceeds.\n\nHERMANN. By all the devils in hell, I'll scratch out his eyes with my\nown nails!\n\nFRANCIS. What? you are growing angry? What signifies your anger? What\nharm can you do him? What can a mouse like you do to such a lion? Your\nrage only makes his triumph the sweeter. You can do nothing more than\ngnash your teeth, and vent your rage upon a dry crust.\n\nHERMANN (stamping). I will grind him to powder!\n\nFRANCIS (slapping his shoulder). Fie, Hermann! You are a gentleman.\nYou must not put up with the affront. You must not give up the lady,\nno, not for all the world, Hermann! By my soul, I would move heaven and\nearth were I in your place.\n\nHERMANN. I will not rest till I have him, and him, too, under ground.\n\nFRANCIS. Not so violent, Hermann! Come nearer--you shall have Amelia.\n\nHERMANN. That I must; despite the devil himself, I will have her.\n\nFRANCIS. You shall have her, I tell you; and that from my hand. Come\ncloser, I say.--You don't know, perhaps, that Charles is as good as\ndisinherited.\n\nHERMANN (going closer to him). Incredible! The first I have heard of\nit.\n\nFRANCIS. Be patient, and listen! Another time you shall hear more.--\nYes, I tell you, as good as banished these eleven months. But the old\nman already begins to lament the hasty step, which, however, I flatter\nmyself (with a smile) is not entirely his own. Amelia, too, is\nincessantly pursuing him with her tears and reproaches. Presently he\nwill be having him searched for in every quarter of the world; and if he\nfinds him--then it's all over with you, Hermann. You may perhaps have\nthe honor of most obsequiously holding the coach-door while he alights\nwith the lady to get married.\n\nHERMANN. I'll strangle him at the altar first.\n\nFRANCIS. His father will soon give up his estates to him, and live in\nretirement in his castle. Then the proud roysterer will have the reins\nin his own hands, and laugh his enemies to scorn;--and I, who wished to\nmake a great man of you--a man of consequence--I myself, Hermann, shall\nhave to make my humble obeisance at his threshold.\n\nHERMANN (with fire). No, as sure as my name is Hermann, that shall\nnever be! If but the smallest spark of wit glimmer in this brain of\nmine, that shall never be!\n\nFRANCIS. Will you be able to prevent it? You, too, my good Hermann,\nwill be made to feel his lash. He will spit in your face when he meets\nyou in the streets; and woe be to you should you venture to shrug your\nshoulders or to make a wry mouth. Look, my friend! this is all that\nyour lovesuit, your prospects, and your mighty plans amount to.\n\nHERMANN. Tell me, what am I to do?\n\nFRANCIS. Well, then, listen, Hermann! You see how I enter into your\nfeelings, like a true friend. Go--disguise yourself, so that no one may\nrecognize you; obtain audience of the old man; pretend to come straight\nfrom Bohemia, to have been at the battle of Prague along with my\nbrother--to have seen him breathe his last on the field of battle!\n\nHERMANN. Will he believe me?\n\nFRANCIS. Ho! ho! let that be my care! Take this packet. There you\nwill find your commission set forth at large; and documents, to boot,\nwhich shall convince the most incredulous. Only make haste to get away\nunobserved. Slip through the back gate into the yard, and then scale\nthe garden wall.--The denouement of this tragicomedy you may leave to\nme!\n\nHERMANN. That, I suppose, will be, \"Long live our new baron, Francis\nvon Moor!\"\n\nFRANCIS (patting his cheeks). How cunning you are! By this means, you\nsee, we attain all our aims at once and quickly. Amelia relinquishes\nall hope of him,--the old man reproaches himself for the death of his\nson, and--he sickens--a tottering edifice needs no earthquake to bring\nit down--he will not survive the intelligence--then am I his only son,\n--Amelia loses every support, and becomes the plaything of my will, and\nyou may easily guess--in short, all will go as we wish--but you must not\nflinch from your word.\n\nHERMANN. What do you say? (Exultingly.) Sooner shall the ball turn\nback in its course, and bury itself in the entrails of the marksman.\nDepend upon me! Only let me to the work. Adieu!\n\nFRANCIS (calling after him). The harvest is thine, dear Hermann!\n(Alone.) When the ox has drawn the corn into the barn, he must put up\nwith hay. A dairy maid for thee, and no Amelia!\n\n\n\n\n          SCENE II.--Old Moor's Bedchamber.\n\n         OLD MOOR asleep in an arm-chair; AMELIA.\n\n\nAMELIA (approaching him on tip-toe). Softly! Softly! He slumbers.\n(She places herself before him.) How beautiful! how venerable!--\nvenerable as the picture of a saint. No, I cannot be angry with thee,\nthou head with the silver locks; I cannot be angry with thee! Slumber\non gently, wake up cheerfully--I alone will be the sufferer.\n\nOLD M. (dreaming). My son! my son! my son!\n\nAMELIA (seizes his hand). Hark!--hark! his son is in his dreams.\n\nOLD M. Are you there? Are you really there! Alas! how miserable you\nseem! Fix not on me that mournful look! I am wretched enough.\n\nAMELIA (awakens him abruptly). Look up, dear old man! 'Twas but a\ndream. Collect yourself!\n\nOLD M. (half awake). Was he not there? Did I not press his hands?\nCruel Francis! wilt thou tear him even from my dreams?\n\nAMELIA (aside). Ha! mark that, Amelia!\n\nOLD M. (rousing himself). Where is he? Where? Where am I? You here,\nAmelia?\n\nAMELIA. How do you find yourself? You have had a refreshing slumber.\n\nOLD M. I was dreaming about my son. Why did I not dream on? Perhaps I\nmight have obtained forgiveness from his lips.\n\nAMELIA. Angels bear no resentment--he forgives you. (Seizes his hand\nsorrowfully.) Father of my Charles! I, too, forgive you.\n\nOLD M. No, no, my child! That death-like paleness of thy cheek is the\nfather's condemnation. Poor girl! I have robbed thee of the happiness\nof thy youth. Oh, do not curse me!\n\nAMELIA (affectionately kissing his hand). I curse you?\n\nOLD M. Dost thou know this portrait, my daughter?\n\nAMELIA. Charles!\n\nOLD M. Such was he in his sixteenth year. But now, alas! how changed.\nOh, it is raging within me. That gentleness is now indignation; that\nsmile despair. It was his birthday, was it not, Amelia--in the\njessamine bower--when you drew this picture of him? Oh, my daughter!\nHow happy was I in your loves.\n\nAMELIA (with her eye still riveted upon the picture). No, no, it is not\nhe! By Heaven, that is not Charles! Here (pointing to her head and her\nheart), here he is perfect; and how different. The feeble pencil avails\nnot to express that heavenly spirit which reigned in his fiery eye.\nAway with it! This is a poor image, an ordinary man! I was a mere\ndauber.\n\nOLD M. That kind, that cheering look! Had that been at my bedside,\nI should have lived in the midst of death. Never, never should I have\ndied!\n\nAMELIA. No, you would never, never have died. It would have been but a\nleap, as we leap from one thought to another and a better. That look\nwould have lighted you across the tomb--that look would have lifted you\nbeyond the stars!\n\nOLD M. It is hard! it is sad! I am dying, and my son Charles is not\nhere--I am borne to my tomb, and he weeps not over my grave. How sweet\nit is to be lulled into the sleep of death by a son's prayer--that is\nthe true requiem.\n\nAMELIA (with enthusiasm). Yes, sweet it is, heavenly sweet, to be\nlulled into the sleep of death by the song of the beloved. Perhaps our\ndreams continue in the grave--a long, eternal, never-ending dream of\nCharles--till the trumpet of resurrection sounds--(rising in ecstasy)\n--and thenceforth and forever in his arms! (A pause; she goes to the\npiano and plays.)\n\n                ANDROMACHE.\n\n        Oh, Hector, wilt thou go for evermore,\n        When fierce Achilles, on the blood-stained shore,\n         Heaps countless victims o'er Patroclus' grave?\n        When then thy hapless orphan boy will rear,\n        Teach him to praise the gods and hurl the spear,\n         When thou art swallow'd up in Xanthus' wave?\n\n\nOLD M. A beautiful song, my daughter. You must play that to me before\nI die.\n\nAMELIA. It is the parting of Hector and Andromache. Charles and I used\noften to sing it together to the guitar. (She continues.)\n\n\n                 HECTOR.\n\n        Beloved wife! stern duty calls to arms--\n        Go, fetch my lance! and cease those vain alarms!\n         On me is cast the destiny of Troy!\n        Astyanax, my child, the Gods will shield,\n        Should Hector fall upon the battle-field;\n         And in Elysium we shall meet with joy!\n\n\nEnter DANIEL.\n\nDANIEL. There is a man without, who craves to be admitted to your\npresence, and says he brings tidings of importance.\n\nOLD M. To me there is but one thing in this world of importance; thou\nknowest it, Amelia. Perhaps it is some unfortunate creature who seeks\nassistance? He shall not go hence in sorrow.\n\nAMELIA.--If it is a beggar, let him come up quickly.\n\nOLD M. Amelia, Amelia! spare me!\n\nAMELIA (continues to play and sing.)\n\n\n                ANDROMACHE.\n\n        Thy martial tread no more will grace my hall--\n        Thine arms shall hang sad relics on the wall--\n        And Priam's race of godlike heroes fade!\n        Oh, thou wilt go where Phoebus sheds no light--\n        Where black Cocytus wails in endless night\n         Thy love will die in Lethe's gloomy shade.\n\n\n                 HECTOR.\n\n        Though I in Lethe's darksome wave should sink,\n        And cease on other mortal ties to think,\n         Yet thy true love shall never be forgot!\n        Hark! on the walls I hear the battle roar--\n        Gird on my armor--and, oh, weep no more.\n        Thy Hector's love in Lethe dieth not!\n\n\n       (Enter FRANCIS, HERMANN in disguise, DANIEL.)\n\nFRANCIS. Here is the man. He says that he brings terrible news. Can\nyou bear the recital!\n\nOLD M. I know but one thing terrible to hear. Come hither, friend, and\nspare me not! Hand him a cup of wine!\n\nHERMANN (in a feigned voice). Most gracious Sir? Let not a poor man be\nvisited with your displeasure, if against his will he lacerates your\nheart. I am a stranger in these parts, but I know you well; you are the\nfather of Charles von Moor.\n\nOLD M. How know you that?\n\nHERMANN. I knew your son\n\nAMELIA (starting up). He lives then? He lives! You know him? Where\nis he? Where? (About to rush out.)\n\nOLD M. What know you about my son?\n\nHERMANN. He was a student at the university of Leipzic. From thence he\ntravelled about, I know not how far. He wandered all over Germany, and,\nas he told me himself, barefoot and bareheaded, begging his bread from\ndoor to door. After five months, the fatal war between Prussia and\nAustria broke out afresh, and as he had no hopes left in this world, the\nfame of Frederick's victorious banner drew him to Bohemia. Permit me,\nsaid he to the great Schwerin, to die on the bed of heroes, for I have\nno longer a father!--\n\nOLD M. O! Amelia! Look not on me!\n\nHERMANN. They gave him a pair of colors. With the Prussians he flew on\nthe wings of victory. We chanced to lie together, in the same tent. He\ntalked much of his old father, and of happy days that were past--and of\ndisappointed hopes--it brought the tears into our eyes.\n\nOLD M. (buries his face in his pillow).--No more! Oh, no more!\n\nHERMANN. A week after, the fierce battle of Prague was fought--I can\nassure you your son behaved like a brave soldier. He performed\nprodigies that day in sight of the whole army. Five regiments were\nsuccessively cut down by his side, and still he kept his ground. Fiery\nshells fell right and left, and still your son kept his ground. A ball\nshattered his right hand: he seized the colors with his left, and still\nhe kept his ground!\n\nAMELIA (in transport). Hector, Hector! do you hear? He kept his\nground!\n\nHERMANN. On the evening of the battle I found him on the same spot. He\nhad sunk down, amidst a shower of hissing balls: with his left hand he\nwas staunching the blood that flowed from a fearful wound; his right he\nhad buried in the earth. \"Comrade!\" cried he when he saw me, \"there has\nbeen a report through the ranks that the general fell an hour ago--\"\n\"He is fallen,\" I replied, \"and thou?\" \"Well, then,\" he cried,\nwithdrawing his left hand from the wound, \"let every brave soldier\nfollow his general!\" Soon after he breathed out his noble soul, to join\nhis heroic leader.\n\nFRANCIS (feigning to rush wildly on HERMANN). May death seal thy\naccursed lips! Art thou come here to give the death-blow to our father?\nFather! Amelia! father!\n\nHERMANN. It was the last wish of my expiring comrade. \"Take this\nsword,\" faltered he, with his dying breath, \"deliver it to my aged\nfather; his son's blood is upon it--he is avenged--let him rejoice.\nTell him that his curse drove me into battle and into death; that I fell\nin despair.\" His last sigh was \"Amelia.\"\n\nAMELIA (like one aroused from lethargy). His last sigh--Amelia!\n\nOLD M. (screaming horribly, and tearing his hair). My curse drove him\ninto death! He fell in despair!\n\nFRANCIS (pacing up and down the room). Oh! what have you done, father?\nMy Charles! my brother!\n\nHERMANN. Here is the sword; and here, too, is a picture which he drew\nfrom his breast at the same time. It is the very image of this young\nlady. \"This for my brother Francis,\" he said; I know not what he meant\nby it.\n\nFRANCIS (feigning astonishment). For me? Amelia's picture? For me--\nCharles--Amelia? For me?\n\nAMELIA (rushing violently upon HERMANN). Thou venal, bribed impostor!\n(Lays hold of him.)\n\nHERMANN. I am no impostor, noble lady. See yourself if it is not your\npicture. It may be that you yourself gave it to him.\n\nFRANCIS. By heaven, Amelia! your picture! It is, indeed.\n\nAMELIA (returns him the picture) My picture, mine! Oh! heavens and\nearth!\n\nOLD M. (screaming and tearing his face.) Woe, woe! my curse drove him\ninto death! He fell in despair!\n\nFRANCIS. And he thought of me in the last and parting hour--of me.\nAngelic soul! When the black banner of death already waved over him he\nthought of me!\n\nOLD M. (stammering like an idiot.) My curse drove him into death. In\ndespair my son perished.\n\nHERMANN. This is more than I can bear! Farewell, old gentleman!\n(Aside to FRANCIS.) How could you have the heart to do this?\n                         [Exit in haste.]\n\nAMELIA (rises and rushes after him). Stay! stay! What were his last\nwords?\n\nHERMANN (calling back). His last sigh was \"Amelia.\"\n                         [Exit.]\n\nAMELIA. His last sigh was Amelia! No, thou art no impostor. It is too\ntrue--true--he is dead--dead! (staggering to and fro till she sinks\ndown)--dead--Charles is dead!\n\nFRANCIS. What do I see? What is this line on the sword?--written with\nblood--Amelia!\n\nAMELIA. By him?\n\nFRANCIS. Do I see clearly, or am I dreaming? Behold, in characters of\nblood, \"Francis, forsake not my Amelia.\" And on the other side,\n\"Amelia, all-powerful death has released thee from thy oath.\" Now do\nyou see--do you see? With hand stiffening in death he wrote it, with\nhis warm life's blood he wrote it--wrote it on the solemn brink of\neternity. His spirit lingered in his flight to unite Francis and\nAmelia.\n\nAMELIA. Gracious heaven! it is his own hand. He never loved me.\n                         [Rushes off]\n\nFRANCIS (stamping the ground). Confusion! her stubborn heart foils all\nmy cunning!\n\nOLD MOOR. Woe, woe! forsake me not, my daughter! Francis, Francis!\ngive me back my son!\n\nFRANCIS. Who was it that cursed him? Who was it that drove his son\ninto battle, and death, and despair? Oh, he was an angel, a jewel of\nheaven! A curse on his destroyers! A curse, a curse upon yourself!\n\nOLD MOOR (strikes his breast and forehead with his clenched fist). He\nwas an angel, a jewel of heaven! A curse, a curse, perdition, a curse\non myself! I am the father who slew his noble son! He loved me even to\ndeath! To expiate my vengeance he rushed into battle and into death!\nMonster, monster that I am! (He rages against himself.)\n\nFRANCIS. He is gone. What avail these tardy lamentations? (with a\nsatanic sneer.) It is easier to murder than to restore to life. You\nwill never bring him back from his grave.\n\nOLD Moon. Never, never, never bring him back from the grave! Gone!\nlost for ever! And you it was that beguiled my heart to curse him.--\nyou--you--Give me back my son!\n\nFRANCIS. Rouse not my fury, lest I forsake you even in the hour of\ndeath!\n\nOLD MOOR. Monster! inhuman monster! Restore my son to me. (Starts\nfrom the chair and attempts to catch FRANCIS by the throat, who flings\nhim back.)\n\nFRANCIS. Feeble old dotard I would you dare? Die! despair!\n                            [Exit.]\n\nOLD MOOR. May the thunder of a thousand curses light upon thee! thou\nhast robbed me of my son. (Throwing himself about in his chair full of\ndespair). Alas! alas! to despair and yet not die. They fly, they\nforsake me in death; my guardian angels fly from me; all the saints\nwithdraw from the hoary murderer. Oh, misery! will no one support this\nhead, no one release this struggling soul? No son, no daughter, no\nfriend, not one human being--will no one? Alone--forsaken. Woe, woe!\nTo despair, yet not to die!\n\n\n         Enter AMELIA, her eyes red with weeping.\n\nOLD MOOR. Amelia! messenger of heaven! Art thou come to release my\nsoul?\n\nAMELIA (in a gentle tone). You have lost a noble son.\n\nOLD MOOR. Murdered him, you mean. With the weight of this impeachment\nI shall present myself before the judgment-seat of God.\n\nAMELIA. Not so, old man! Our heavenly Father has taken him to himself.\nWe should have been too happy in this world. Above, above, beyond the\nstars, we shall meet again.\n\nOLD MOOR. Meet again! Meet again! Oh! it will pierce my soul like a\nSword--should I, a saint, meet him among the saints. In the midst of\nheaven the horrors of hell will strike through me! The remembrance of\nthat deed will crush me in the presence of the Eternal: I have murdered\nmy son!\n\nAMELIA. Oh, his smiles will chase away the bitter remembrance from your\nsoul! Cheer up, dear father! I am quite cheerful. Has he not already\nsung the name of Amelia to listening angels on seraphic harps, and has\nnot heaven's choir sweetly echoed it? Was not his last sigh, Amelia?\nAnd will not Amelia be his first accent of joy?\n\nOLD MOOR. Heavenly consolation flows from your lips! He will smile\nupon me, you say? He will forgive me? You must stay with my beloved\nof my Charles, when I die.\n\nAMELIA. To die is to fly to his arms. Oh, how happy and enviable is\nyour lot! Would that my bones were decayed!--that my hairs were gray!\nWoe upon the vigor of youth! Welcome, decrepid age, nearer to heaven\nand my Charles!\n\n\n               Enter FRANCIS.\n\nOLD MOOR. Come near, my son! Forgive me if I spoke too harshly to you\njust now! I forgive you all. I wish to yield up my spirit in peace.\n\nFRANCIS. Have you done weeping for your son? For aught that I see you\nhad but one.\n\nOLD MOOR. Jacob had twelve sons, but for his Joseph he wept tears of\nblood.\n\nFRANCIS. Hum!\n\nOLD MOOR. Bring the Bible, my daughter, and read to me the story of\nJacob and Joseph! It always appeared to me so touching, even before I\nmyself became a Jacob.\n\nAMELIA. What part shall I read to you? (Takes the Bible and turns over\nthe leaves.)\n\nOLD MOOR. Read to me the grief of the bereaved father, when he found\nhis Joseph no more among his children;--when he sought him in vain\namidst his eleven sons;--and his lamentation when he heard that he was\ntaken from him forever.\n\nAMELIA (reads). \"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the\ngoats, and dipped the coat in the blood; and they sent the coat of many\ncolors, and they brought it to their father, and said, 'This have we\nfound: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.' (Exit FRANCIS\nsuddenly.) And he knew it and said, 'It is my son's coat; an evil beast\nhath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.'\"\n\nOLD MOOR (falls back upon the pillow). An evil beast hath devoured\nJoseph!\n\nAMELIA (continues reading). \"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put\nsackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. And all\nhis sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to\nbe comforted, and he said, 'For I will go down into the grave--'\"\n\nOLD MOOR. Leave off! leave off. I feel very ill.\n\nAMELIA (running towards him, lets fall the book). Heaven help us! What\nis this?\n\nOLD MOOR. It is death--darkness--is waving--before my eyes--I pray\nthee--send for the minister--that he may--give me--the Holy Communion.\nWhere is--my son Francis?\n\nAMELIA. He is fled. God have mercy upon us!\n\nOLD MOOR. Fled--fled from his father's deathbed? And is that all--all\n--of two children full of promise--thou hast given--thou hast--taken\naway--thy name be--\n\nAMELIA (with a sudden cry). Dead! both dead!\n                         [Exit in despair.]\n\n\n           Enter FRANCIS, dancing with joy.\n\nFRANCIS. Dead, they cry, dead! Now am I master. Through the whole\ncastle it rings, dead! but stay, perchance he only sleeps? To be sure,\nyes, to be sure! that certainly is a sleep after which no \"good-morrow\"\nis ever said. Sleep and death are but twin-brothers. We will for once\nchange their names! Excellent, welcome sleep! We will call thee death!\n(He closes the eyes of OLD MOOR.) Who now will come forward and dare to\naccuse me at the bar of justice, or tell me to my face, thou art a\nvillain? Away, then, with this troublesome mask of humility and virtue!\nNow you shall see Francis as he is, and tremble! My father was\novergentle in his demands, turned his domain into a family-circle, sat\nblandly smiling at the gate, and saluted his peasants as brethren and\nchildren. My brows shall lower upon you like thunderclouds; my lordly\nname shall hover over you like a threatening comet over the mountains;\nmy forehead shall be your weather-glass! He would caress and fondle\nthe child that lifted its stubborn head against him. But fondling and\ncaressing is not my mode. I will drive the rowels of the spur into\ntheir flesh, and give the scourge a trial. Under my rule it shall be\nbrought to pass that potatoes and small-beer shall be considered a\nholiday treat; and woe to him who meets my eye with the audacious front\nof health. Haggard want and crouching fear are my insignia; and in this\nlivery I will clothe ye.\n                            [Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n          SCENE III.--THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.\n\n         SPIEGELBERG, RAZMAN, A Troop Of ROBBERS.\n\n\nRAZ. Are you come? Is it really you? Oh, let me squeeze thee into a\njelly, my dear heart's brother! Welcome to the Bohemian forests! Why,\nyou are grown quite stout and jolly! You have brought us recruits in\nright earnest, a little army of them; you are the very prince of crimps.\n\nSPIEGEL. Eh, brother? Eli? And proper fellows they are! You must\nconfess the blessing of heaven is visibly upon me; I was a poor, hungry\nwretch, and had nothing but this staff when I went over the Jordan, and\nnow there are eight-and-seventy of us, mostly ruined shopkeepers,\nrejected masters of arts, and law-clerks from the Swabian provinces.\nThey are a rare set of fellows, brother, capital fellows, I promise you;\nthey will steal you the very buttons off each other's trousers in\nperfect security, although in the teeth of a loaded musket,* and they\nlive in clover and enjoy a reputation for forty miles round, which is\nquite astonishing.\n\n   *[The acting edition reads, \"Hang your hat up in the sun, and I'll\n   take you a wager it's gone the next minute, as clean out of sight\n   as if the devil himself had walked off with it.\"]\n\nThere is not a newspaper in which you will not find some little feat or\nother of that cunning fellow, Spiegelberg; I take in the papers for\nnothing else; they have described me from head to foot; you would think\nyou saw me; they have not forgotten even my coat-buttons. But we lead\nthem gloriously by the nose. The other day I went to the\nprinting-office and pretended that I had seen the famous Spiegelberg,\ndictated to a penny-a-liner who was sitting there the exact image of a\nquack doctor in the town; the matter gets wind, the fellow is arrested,\nput to the rack, and in his anguish and stupidity he confesses the devil\ntake me if he does not--confesses that he is Spiegelberg. Fire and fury!\nI was on the point of giving myself up to a magistrate rather than have\nmy fair fame marred by such a poltroon; however, within three months he\nwas hanged. I was obliged to stuff a right good pinch of snuff into my\nnose as some time afterwards I was passing the gibbet and saw the\npseudo-Spiegelberg parading there in all his glory; and, while\nSpiegelberg's representative is dangling by the neck, the real\nSpiegelberg very quietly slips himself out of the noose, and makes jolly\nlong noses behind the backs of these sagacious wiseacres of the law.\n\nRAZ. (laughing). You are still the same fellow you always were.\n\nSPIEGEL. Ay, sure! body and soul. But I must tell you a bit of fun,\nmy boy, which I had the other day in the nunnery of St. Austin. We fell\nin with the convent just about sunset; and as I had not fired a single\ncartridge all day,--you know I hate the _diem perdidi_ as I hate death\nitself,--I was determined to immortalize the night by some glorious\nexploit, even though it should cost the devil one of his ears! We kept\nquite quiet till late in the night. At last all is as still as a mouse\n--the lights are extinguished. We fancy the nuns must be comfortably\ntucked up. So I take brother Grimm along with me, and order the others\nto wait at the gate till they hear my whistle--I secure the watchman,\ntake the keys from him, creep into the maid-servants' dormitory, take.\naway all their clothes, and whisk the bundle out at the window. We go\non from cell to cell, take away the clothes of one sister after another,\nand lastly those of the lady-abbess herself. Then I sound my whistle,\nand my fellows outside begin to storm and halloo as if doomsday was at\nhand, and away they rush with the devil's own uproar into the cells of\nthe sisters! Ha, ha, ha! You should have seen the game--how the poor\ncreatures were groping about in the dark for their petticoats, and how\nthey took on when they found they were gone; and we, in the meantime, at\n'em like very devils; and now, terrified and amazed, they wriggled under\ntheir bedclothes, or cowered together like cats behind the stoves.\nThere was such shrieking and lamentation; and then the old beldame of an\nabbess--you know, brother, there is nothing in the world I hate so much\nas a spider and an old woman--so you may just fancy that wrinkled old\nhag standing naked before me, conjuring me by her maiden modesty\nforsooth! Well, I was determined to make short work of it; either, said\nI, out with your plate and your convent jewels and all your shining\ndollars, or--my fellows knew what I meant. The end of it was I brought\naway more than a thousand dollars' worth out of the convent, to say\nnothing of the fun, which will tell its own story in due time.\n\nRAZ. (stamping on the ground). Hang it, that I should be absent on\nsuch an occasion.\n\nSPIEGEL. Do you see? Now tell me, is not that life? 'Tis that which\nkeeps one fresh and hale, and braces the body so that it swells hourly\nlike an abbot's paunch; I don't know, but I think I must be endowed with\nsome magnetic property, which attracts all the vagabonds on the face of\nthe earth towards me like steel and iron.\n\nRAZ. A precious magnet, indeed. But I should like to know, I'll be\nhanged if I shouldn't, what witchcraft you use?\n\nSPIEGEL. Witchcraft? No need of witchcraft. All it wants is a head--a\ncertain practical capacity which, of course, is not taken in with every\nspoonful of barley meal; for you know I have always said that an honest\nman may be carved out of any willow stump, but to make a rogue you must\nhave brains; besides which it requires a national genius--a certain\nrascal-climate--so to speak.*\n\n   *[In the first (and suppressed) edition was added, \"Go to the\n   Grisons, for instance; that is what I call the thief's Athens.\"\n   This obnoxious passage has been carefully expunged from all the\n   subsequent editions. It gave mortal offence to the Grison\n   magistrates, who made a formal complaint of the insult and caused\n   Schiller to be severely rebuked by the Grand Duke. This incident\n   forms one of the epochs in our author's history.]\n\nRAZ. Brother, I have heard Italy celebrated for its artists.\n\nSPIEGEL. Yes, yes! Give the devil his due. Italy makes a very noble\nfigure; and if Germany goes on as it has begun, and if the Bible gets\nfairly kicked out, of which there is every prospect, Germany, too, may\nin time arrive at something respectable; but I should tell you that\nclimate does not, after all, do such a wonderful deal; genius thrives\neverywhere; and as for the rest, brother, a crab, you know, will never\nbecome a pineapple, not even in Paradise. But to pursue our subject,\nwhere did I leave off?\n\nRAZ. You were going to tell me about your stratagems.\n\nSPIEGEL. Ah, yes! my stratagems. Well, when you get into a town, the\nfirst thing is to fish out from the beadles, watchmen, and turnkeys, who\nare their best customers, and for these, accordingly, you must look out;\nthen ensconce yourself snugly in coffee-houses, brothels, and\nbeer-shops, and observe who cry out most against the cheapness of the\ntimes, the reduced five per cents., and the increasing nuisance of police\nregulations; who rail the loudest against government, or decry\nphysiognomical science, and such like? These are the right sort of\nfellows, brother. Their honesty is as loose as a hollow tooth; you have\nonly to apply your pincers. Or a shorter and even better plan is to drop\na full purse in the public highway, conceal yourself somewhere near, and\nmark who finds it. Presently after you come running up, search, proclaim\nyour loss aloud, and ask him, as it were casually, \"Have you perchance\npicked up a purse, sir?\" If he says \"Yes,\" why then the devil fails you.\nBut if he denies it, with a \"pardon me, sir, I remember, I am sorry,\nsir,\" (he jumps up), then, brother, you've done the trick. Extinguish\nyour lantern, cunning Diogenes, you have found your match.\n\nRAZ. You are an accomplished practitioner.\n\nSPIEGEL. My God! As if that had ever been doubted. Well, then, when\nyou have got your man into the net, you must take great care to land him\ncleverly. You see, my son, the way I have managed is thus: as soon as I\nwas on the scent I stuck to my candidate like a leech; I drank\nbrotherhood with him, and, _nota bene_, you must always pay the score.\nThat costs a pretty penny, it is true, but never mind that. You must go\nfurther; introduce him to gaming-houses and brothels; entangle him in\nbroils and rogueries till he becomes bankrupt in health and strength, in\npurse, conscience, and reputation; for I must tell you, by the way, that\nyou will make nothing of it unless you ruin both body and soul. Believe\nme, brother, and I have experienced it more than fifty times in my\nextensive practice, that when the honest man is once ousted from his\nstronghold, the devil has it all his own way--the transition is then as\neasy as from a whore to a devotee. But hark! What bang was that?\n\nRAZ. It was thunder; go on.\n\nSPIEGEL. Or, there is a yet shorter and still better way. You strip\nyour man of all he has, even to his very shirt, and then he will come to\nyou of his own accord; you won't teach me to suck eggs, brother; ask\nthat copper-faced fellow there. My eyes, how neatly I got him into my\nmeshes. I showed him forty ducats, which I promised to give him if he\nwould bring me an impression in wax of his master's keys. Only think,\nthe stupid brute not only does this, but actually brings me--I'll be\nhanged if he did not--the keys themselves; and then thinks to get the\nmoney. \"Sirrah,\" said I, \"are you aware that I am going to carry these\nkeys straight to the lieutenant of police, and to bespeak a place for\nyou on the gibbet?\" By the powers! you should have seen how the\nsimpleton opened his eyes, and began to shake from head to foot like a\ndripping poodle. \"For heaven's sake, sir, do but consider. I will--\nwill--\" \"What will you? Will you at once cut your stick and go to the\ndevil with me?\" \"Oh, with all my heart, with great pleasure.\" Ha! ha!\nha! my fine fellow; toasted cheese is the thing to catch mice with; do\nhave a good laugh at him, Razman; ha! ha! ha!\n\nRAZ. Yes, yes, I must confess. I shall inscribe that lesson in letters\nof gold upon the tablet of my brain. Satan must know his people right\nwell to have chosen you for his factor.\n\nSPIEGEL. Eh, brother? Eli? And if I help him to half a score of\nfellows he will, of course, let me off scot-free--publishers, you know,\nalways give one copy in ten gratis to those who collect subscribers for\nthem; why should the devil be more of a Jew? Razman, I smell powder.\n\nRAZ. Zounds! I smelt it long ago. You may depend upon it there has\nbeing something going forward hereabouts. Yes, yes! I can tell you,\nSpiegelberg, you will be welcome to our captain with your recruits; he,\ntoo, has got hold of some brave fellows.\n\nSPIEGEL. But look at mine! at mine here, bah!\n\nRAZ. Well, well! they may be tolerably expert in the finger\ndepartment, but, I tell you, the fame of our captain has tempted even\nsome honorable men to join his staff.\n\nSPIEGEL. So much the worse.\n\nRAZ. Without joking. And they are not ashamed to serve under such a\nleader. He does not commit murder as we do for the sake of plunder; and\nas to money, as soon as he had plenty of it at command, he did not seem\nto care a straw for it; and his third of the booty, which belongs to him\nof right, he gives away to orphans, or supports promising young men with\nit at college. But should he happen to get a country squire into his\nclutches who grinds down his peasants like cattle, or some gold-laced\nvillain, who warps the law to his own purposes, and hoodwinks the eyes\nof justice with his gold, or any chap of that kidney; then, my boy, he\nis in his element, and rages like a very devil, as if every fibre in his\nbody were a fury.\n\nSPIEGEL. Humph!\n\nRAZ. The other day we were told at a tavern that a rich count from\nRatisbon was about to pass through, who had gained the day in a suit\nworth a million of money by the craftiness of his lawyer. The captain\nwas just sitting down to a game of backgammon. \"How many of us are\nthere?\" said he to me, rising in haste. I saw him bite his nether lip,\nwhich he never does except when he is very determined. \"Not more than\nfive,\" I replied. \"That's enough,\" he said; threw his score on the\ntable, left the wine he had ordered untouched, and off we went. The\nwhole time he did not utter a syllable, but walked aloof and alone, only\nasking us from time to time whether we heard anything, and now and then\ndesiring us to lay our ears to the ground. At last the count came in\nsight, his carriage heavily laden, the lawyer, seated by his side, an\noutrider in advance, and two horsemen riding behind. Then you should\nhave seen the man. With a pistol in each hand he ran before us to the\ncarriage,--and the voice with which he thundered, \"Halt!\" The coachman,\nwho would not halt, was soon toppled from his box; the count fired out\nof the carriage and missed--the horseman fled. \"Your money, rascal!\"\ncried Moor, with his stentorian voice. The count lay like a bullock\nunder the axe: \"And are you the rogue who turns justice into a venal\nprostitute?\" The lawyer shook till his teeth chattered again; and a\ndagger soon stuck in his body, like a stake in a vineyard. \"I have done\nmy part,\" cried the captain, turning proudly away; \"the plunder is your\naffair.\" And with this he vanished into the forest.\n\nSPIEGEL. Hum! hum! Brother, what I told you just now remains between\nourselves; there is no occasion for his knowing it. You understand me?\n\nRAZ. Yes, yes, I understand!\n\nSPIEGEL. You know the man! He has his own notions! You understand me?\n\nRAZ. Oh, I quite understand.\n\n           (Enter SCHWARZ at full speed).\n\nWho's there? What is the matter? Any travellers in the forest?\n\nSCHWARZ. Quick, quick! Where are the others? Zounds! there you stand\ngossiping! Don't you know--do you know nothing of it?--that poor\nRoller--\n\nPAZ. What of him? What of him?\n\nSCHWARZ. He's hanged, that's all, and four others with him--\n\nRAz. Roller hanged? S'death! when? How do you know?\n\nSCHWARZ. He has been in limbo more than three weeks, and we knew\nnothing of it. He was brought up for examination three several days,\nand still we heard nothing. They put him to the rack to make him tell\nwhere the captain was to be found--but the brave fellow would not slip.\nYesterday he got his sentence, and this morning was dispatched express\nto the devil!\n\nRAZ. Confound it! Does the captain know?\n\nSCHWARZ. He heard of it only yesterday. He foamed like a wild boar.\nYou know that Roller was always an especial favorite; and then the rack!\nRopes and scaling-ladders were conveyed to the prison, but in vain.\nMoor himself got access to him disguised as a Capuchin monk, and\nproposed to change clothes with him; but Roller absolutely refused;\nwhereupon the captain swore an oath that made our very flesh creep. He\nvowed that he would light a funeral pile for him, such as had never yet\ngraced the bier of royalty, one that should burn them all to cinders. I\nfear for the city. He has long owed it a grudge for its intolerable\nbigotry; and you know, when he says, \"I'll do it,\" the thing is as good\nas done.\n\nRAZ. That is true! I know the captain. If he had pledged his word to\nthe devil to go to hell he never would pray again, though half a\npater-noster would take him to heaven. Alas! poor Roller!--poor Roller!\n\nSPIEGEL. _Memento mori_! But it does not concern me. (Hums a tune).\n\n        Should I happen to pass the gallows stone,\n         I shall just take a sight with one eye,\n        And think to myself, you may dangle alone,\n         Who now, sir, 's the fool, you or I?\n\nRAZ. (Jumping up). Hark! a shot! (Firing and noise is heard behind the\nscenes).\n\nSPIEGEL. Another!\n\nRAZ. And another! The captain!\n\n       (Voices behind the scenes are heard singing).\n\n        The Nurnbergers deem it the wisest plan,\n        Never to hang till they've caught their man.\n                         _Da capo_.\n\nSCHWEITZER and ROLLER (behind the scenes). Holla, ho! Holla, ho!\n\nRAZ. Roller! by all the devils! Roller!\n\nSCHWEITZER and ROLLER (still behind the scenes).\nRazman! Schwarz! Spiegelberg! Razman!\n\nRAZ. Roller! Schweitzer! Thunder and lightning!\nFire and fury! (They run towards him.)\n\nEnter CHARLES VON MOOR (on horseback), SCHWEITZER, ROLLER, GRIMM,\nSCHUFTERLE, and a troop of ROBBERS covered with dust and mud.\n\nCHARLES (leaping from his horse) Liberty! Liberty!--Thou art on terra\nfirma, Roller! Take my horse, Schweitzer, and wash him with wine.\n(Throws himself on the ground.) That was hot work!\n\nRAZ. (to ROLLER). Well, by the fires of Pluto! Art thou risen from\nthe wheel?\n\nSCHWARZ. Art thou his ghost? or am I a fool? or art thou really the\nman?\n\nROLLER (still breathless). The identical--alive--whole.--Where do you\nthink I come from?\n\nSCHWARZ. It would puzzle a witch to tell! The staff was already broken\nover you.\n\nROLLER. Ay, that it was, and more than that! I come straightway from\nthe gallows. Only let me get my breath. Schweitzer will tell you all.\nGive me a glass of brandy! You there too, Spiegelberg! I thought we\nshould have met again in another place. But give me a glass of brandy!\nmy bones are tumbling to pieces. Oh, my captain! Where is my captain?\n\nSCHWARZ. Have patience, man, have patience. Just tell me--say--come,\nlet's hear--how did you escape? In the name of wonder how came we to\nget you back again? My brain is bewildered. From the gallows, you say?\n\nROLLER (swallows a flask of brandy). Ah, that is capital! that warms\nthe inside! Straight from the gallows, I tell you. You stand there\namid stare as if that was impossible. I can assure you, I was not more\nthan three paces from that blessed ladder, on which I was to mount to\nAbraham's bosom--so near, so very near, that I was sold, skin and all,\nto the dissecting-room! The fee-simple of my life was not worth a pinch\nof snuff. To the captain I am indebted for breath, and liberty, and\nlife.\n\nSCHWEITZER. It was a trick worth the telling. We had heard the day\nbefore, through our spies, that Roller was in the devil's own pickle;\nand unless the vault of heaven fell in suddenly he would, on the morrow\n--that is, to-day--go the way of all flesh. Up! says the captain, and\nfollow me--what is not a friend worth? Whether we save him or not, we\nwill at least light him up a funeral pile such as never yet honored\nroyalty; one which shall burn them black and blue. The whole troop was\nsummoned. We sent Roller a trusty messenger, who conveyed the notice to\nhim in a little billet, which he slipped into his porridge.\n\nROLLER. I had but small hope of success.\n\nSCHWEITZER. We waited till the thoroughfares were clear. The whole\ntown was out after the sight; equestrians, pedestrians, carriages, all\npell-mell; the noise and the gibbet-psalm sounded far and wide. Now,\nsays the captain, light up, light up! We all flew like darts; they set\nfire to the city in three-and-thirty places at once; threw burning\nfirebrands on the powder-magazine, and into the churches and granaries.\nMorbleu! in less than a quarter of an hour a northeaster, which, like\nus, must have owed a grudge to the city, came seasonably to our aid, and\nhelped to lift the flames up to the highest gables. Meanwhile we ran up\nand down the streets like furies, crying, fire! ho! fire! ho! in every\ndirection. There was such howling--screaming-tumult--fire-bells\ntolling. And presently the powder-magazine blew up into the air with a\ncrash as if the earth were rent in twain, heaven burst to shivers, and\nhell sunk ten thousand fathoms deeper.\n\nROLLER. Now my guards looked behind them--there lay the city, like\nSodom and Gomorrah--the whole horizon was one mass of fire, brimstone,\nand smoke; and forty hills echoed and reflected the infernal prank far\nand wide. A panic seized them all--I take advantage of the moment, and,\nquick as lightning--my fetters had been taken off, so nearly was my time\ncome--while my guards were looking away petrified, like Lot's wife, I\nshot off--tore through the crowd--and away! After running some sixty\npaces I throw off my clothes, plunge into the river, and swim along\nunder water till I think they have lost sight of me. My captain stood\nready, with horses and clothes--and here I am. Moor! Moor! I only\nwish that you may soon get into just such another scrape that I may\nrequite you in like manner.\n\nRAZ. A brutal wish, for which you deserve to be hanged. It was a\nglorious prank, though.\n\nROLLER. It was help in need; you cannot judge of it. You should have\nmarched, like me, with a rope round your neck, travelling to your grave\nin the living body, and seen their horrid sacramental forms and\nhangman's ceremonies--and then, at every reluctant step, as the\nstruggling feet were thrust forward, to see the infernal machine, on\nwhich I was to be elevated, glaring more and more hideously in the blaze\nof a noonday sun--and the hangman's rapscallions watching for their prey\n--and the horrible psalm-singing--the cursed twang still rings in my\nears--and the screeching hungry ravens, a whole flight of them, who were\nhovering over the half-rotten carcass of my predecessor. To see all\nthis--ay, more, to have a foretaste of the blessedness which was in\nstore for me! Brother, brother! And then, all of a sudden, the signal\nof deliverance. It was an explosion as if the vault of heaven were rent\nin twain. Hark ye, fellows! I tell you, if a man were to leap out of a\nfiery furnace into a freezing lake he could not feel the contrast half\nso strongly as I did when I gained the opposite shore.\n\nSPIEGEL. (Laughs.) Poor wretch! Well, you have got over it. (Pledges\nhim). Here's to a happy regeneration!\n\nROLLER (flings away his glass). No, by all the treasures of Mammon, I\nshould not like to go through it a second time. Death is something more\nthan a harlequin's leap, and its terrors are even worse than death\nitself.\n\nSPIEGEL. And the powder-magazine leaping into the air! Don't you see\nit now, Razman? That was the reason the air stunk so, for miles round,\nof brimstone, as if the whole wardrobe of Moloch was being aired under\nthe open firmament. It was a master-stroke, captain! I envy you for\nit.\n\nSCHWEITZER. If the town makes it a holiday-treat to see our comrade\nkilled by a baited hog, why the devil should we scruple to sacrifice the\ncity for the rescue of our comrade? And, by the way, our fellows had\nthe extra treat of being able to plunder worse than the old emperor.\nTell me, what have you sacked?\n\nONE OF THE TROOP. I crept into St. Stephen's church during the hubbub,\nand tore the gold lace from the altarcloth. The patron saint, thought I\nto myself, can make gold lace out of packthread.\n\nSCHWEITZER. 'Twas well done. What is the use of such rubbish in a\nchurch? They offer it to the Creator, who despises such trumpery, while\nthey leave his creatures to die of hunger. And you, Sprazeler--where\ndid you throw your net?\n\nA SECOND. I and Brizal broke into a merchant's store, and have brought\nstuffs enough with us to serve fifty men.\n\nA THIRD. I have filched two gold watches and a dozen silver spoons.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Well done, well done! And we have lighted them a bonfire\nthat will take a fortnight to put out again. And, to get rid of the\nfire, they must ruin the city with water. Do you know, Schufterle, how\nmany lives have been lost?\n\nSCHUF. Eighty-three, they say. The powder-magazine alone blew\nthreescore to atoms.\n\nCHARLES (very seriously). Roller, thou art dearly bought.\n\nSCHUF. Bah! bah! What of that? If they had but been men it would have\nbeen another matter--but they were babes in swaddling clothes, and\nshrivelled old nurses that kept the flies from them, and dried-up\nstove-squatters who could not crawl to the door--patients whining for the\ndoctor, who, with his stately gravity, was marching to the sport. All\nthat had the use of their legs had gone forth in the sight, and nothing\nremained at home but the dregs of the city.\n\nCHARLES. Alas for the poor creatures! Sick people, sayest thou, old\nmen and infants?\n\nSCHUF. Ay, the devil go with them! And lying-in-women into the\nbargain; and women far gone with child, who were afraid of miscarrying\nunder the gibbet; and young mothers, who thought the sight might do them\na mischief, and mark the gallows upon the foreheads of their unborn\nbabes--poor poets, without a shoe, because their only pair had been sent\nto the cobbler to mend--and other such vermin, not worth the trouble of\nmentioning. As I chanced to pass by a cottage I heard a great squalling\ninside. I looked in; and, when I came to examine, what do you think it\nwas? Why, an infant--a plump and ruddy urchin--lying on the floor under\na table which was just beginning to burn. Poor little wretch! said I,\nyou will be cold there, and with that I threw it into the flames!\n\nCHARLES. Indeed, Schufterle? Then may those flames burn in thy bosom\nto all eternity! Avaunt, monster! Never let me see thee again in my\ntroop! What! Do you murmur? Do you hesitate? Who dares hesitate when\nI command? Away with him, I say! And there are others among you ripe\nfor my vengeance. I know thee, Spiegelberg. But I will step in among\nyou ere long, and hold a fearful muster-roll.\n                       [Exeunt, trembling.]\n\nCHARLES (alone, walking up and down in great agitation). Hear them not,\nthou avenger in heaven! How can I avert it? Art thou to blame, great\nGod, if thy engines, pestilence, and famine, and floods, overwhelm the\njust with the unjust? Who can stay the flame, which is kindled to\ndestroy the hornet's nest, from extending to the blessed harvest? Oh!\nfie on the slaughter of women, and children, and the sick! How this\ndeed weighs me down! It has poisoned my fairest achievements! There he\nstands, poor fool, abashed and disgraced in the sight of heaven; the boy\nthat presumed to wield Jove's thunder, and overthrew pigmies when he\nshould have crushed Titans. Go, go! 'tis not for thee, puny son of\nclay, to wield the avenging sword of sovereign justice! Thou didst fail\nat thy first essay. Here, then, I renounce the audacious scheme. I go\nto hide myself in some deep cleft of the earth, where no daylight will\nbe witness of my shame. (He is about to fly.)\n\n            Enter a ROBBER hurriedly.\n\nROBBER. Look out, captain! There is mischief in the wind! Whole\ndetachments of Bohemian cavalry are scouring the forests. That infernal\nbailiff must have betrayed us.\n\n              Enter more ROBBERS.\n\n2D ROBBER. Captain! captain! they have tracked us! Some thousands of\nthem are forming a cordon round the middle forest.\n\n            Enter more ROBBERS again.\n\n3D ROBBER. Woe, woe, woe! we are all taken, hanged drawn, and\nquartered. Thousands of hussars, dragoons, and chasseurs are mustering\non the heights, and guard all the passes.\n                     [Exit CHARLES VON MOOR.]\n\n     Enter SCHWEITZER, GRIMM, ROLLER, SCHWARZ, SCHUFTERLE,\n        SPIEGELBERG, RAZMAN, and the whole troop.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Ha! Have we routed them out of their feather-beds at last?\nCome, be jolly, Roller! I have long wished to have a bout with those\nknights of the bread-basket. Where is the captain? Is the whole troop\nassembled? I hope we have powder enough?\n\nRAZ. Powder, I believe you; but we are only eighty in all and therefore\nscarcely one to twenty.\n\nSCHWEITZER. So much the better! And though there were fifty against\nmy great toe-nail--fellows who have waited till we lit the straw under\ntheir very seats. Brother, brother, there is nothing to fear. They\nsell their lives for tenpence; and are we not fighting for our necks?\nWe will pour into them like a deluge, and fire volleys upon their heads\nlike crashes of thunder. But where the devil is the captain.\n\nSPIEGEL. He forsakes us in this extremity. Is there no hope of escape?\n\nSCHWEITZER. Escape?\n\nSPIEGEL. Oh, that I had tarried in Jerusalem!\n\nSCHWEITZER. I wish you were choked in a cesspool, you paltry coward!\nWith defenceless nuns you are a mighty man; but at sight of a pair of\nfists a confirmed sneak! Now show your courage or you shall be sewn up\nalive in an ass's hide and baited to death with dogs.\n\nRAZ. The captain! the captain!\n\n        Enter CHARLES (speaking slowly to himself).\n\nCHARLES. I have allowed them to be hemmed in on every side. Now they\nmust fight with the energy of despair. (Aloud.) Now my boys! now for\nit! We must fight like wounded boars, or we are utterly lost!\n\nSCHWEITZER. Ha! I'll rip them open with my tusks, till their entrails\nprotrude by the yard! Lead on, captain! we will follow you into the\nvery jaws of death.\n\nCHARLES. Charge all your arms! You've plenty of powder, I hope?\n\nSCHWEITZER (with energy). Powder? ay, enough to blow the earth up to\nthe moon.\n\nRAZ. Every one of us has five brace of pistols, ready loaded, and three\ncarbines to boot.\n\nCHARLES. Good! good! Now some of you must climb up the trees, or\nconceal yourselves in the thickets, and some fire upon them in ambush--\n\nSCHWEITZER. That part will suit you, Spiegelberg.\n\nCHARLES. The rest will follow me, and fall upon their flanks like\nfuries.\n\nSCHWEITZER. There will I be!\n\nCHARLES. At the same time let every man make his whistle ring through\nthe forest, and gallop about in every direction, so that our numbers may\nappear the more formidable. And let all the dogs be unchained, and set\non upon their ranks, that they may be broken and dispersed and run in\nthe way of our fire. We three, Roller, Schweitzer, and myself, will\nfight wherever the fray is hottest.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Masterly! excellent! We will so bewilder them with balls\nthat they shall not know whence the salutes are coming. I have more\nthan once shot away a cherry from the mouth. Only let them come on\n(SCHUFTERLE is pulling SCHWEITZER; the latter takes the captain aside,\nand entreats him in a low voice.)\n\nCHARLES. Silence!\n\nSCHWEITZER. I entreat you--\n\nCHARLES. Away! Let him have the benefit of his disgrace; it has saved\nhim. He shall not die on the same field with myself, my Schweitzer, and\nmy Roller. Let him change his apparel, and I will say he is a traveller\nwhom I have plundered. Make yourself easy, Schweitzer. Take my word\nfor it he will be hanged yet.\n\n             Enter FATHER DOMINIC.\n\nFATHER DOM. (to himself, starts). Is this the dragon's nest? With your\nleave, sirs! I am a servant of the church; and yonder are seventeen\nhundred men who guard every hair of my head.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Bravo! bravo! Well spoken to keep his courage warm.\n\nCHARLES. Silence, comrade! Will you tell us briefly, good father, what\nis your errand here?\n\nFATHER Dom. I am delegated by the high justices, on whose sentence\nhangs life or death--ye thieves--ye incendiaries--ye villains--ye\nvenomous generation of vipers, crawling about in the dark, and stinging\nin secret--ye refuse of humanity--brood of hell--food for ravens and\nworms--colonists for the gallows and the wheel--\n\nSCHWEITZER. Dog! a truce with your foul tongue! or ------\n(He holds the butt-end of his gun before FATHER DOMINIC'S face.)\n\nCHARLES. Fie, fie, Schweitzer! You cut the thread of his discourse.\nHe has got his sermon so nicely by heart. Pray go on, Sir! \"for the\ngallows and the wheel?\"\n\nFATHER Dom. And thou, their precious captain!--commander-in-chief of\ncut-purses!--king of sharpers! Grand Mogul of all the rogues under the\nsun!--great prototype of that first hellish ringleader who imbued a\nthousand legions of innocent angels with the flame of rebellion, and\ndrew them down with him into the bottomless pit of damnation! The\nagonizing cries of bereaved mothers pursue thy footsteps! Thou drinkest\nblood like water! and thy murderous knife holds men cheaper than\nair-bubbles!\n\nCHARLES. Very true--exceedingly true! Pray proceed, Sir!\n\nFATHER DOM. What do you mean? Very true--exceedingly true! Is that an\nanswer?\n\nCHARLES. How, Sir? You were not prepared for that, it seems? Go on--\nby all means go on. What more were you going to say?\n\nFATHER DOM. (heated). Abominable wretch! Avaunt! Does not the blood\nof a murdered count of the empire cling to thy accursed fingers? Hast\nthou not, with sacrilegious hands, dared to break into the Lord's\nsanctuary, and carry off the consecrated vessels of the _sanctissimum_?\nHast thou not flung firebrands into our godly city, and brought down the\npowder-magazine upon the heads of devout Christians? (Clasps his\nhands). Horrible, horrible wickedness! that stinketh in the nostrils of\nHeaven, and provoketh the day of judgment to burst upon you suddenly!\nripe for retribution--rushing headlong to the last trump!\n\nCHARLES. Masterly guesses thus far! But now, sir, to the point! What\nis it that the right worshipful justices wish to convey to me through\nyou?\n\nFATHER Dom. What you are not worthy to receive. Look around you,\nincendiary! As far as your eye can reach you are environed by our\nhorsemen--there is no chance of escape. As surely as cherries grow on\nthese oaks, and peaches on these firs, so surely shall you turn your\nbacks upon these oaks and these firs in safety.\n\nCHARLES. Do you hear that, Schweitzer? But go on!\n\nFATHER DOM. Hear, then, what mercy and forbearance justice shows\ntowards such miscreants. If you instantly prostrate yourselves in\nsubmission and sue for mercy and forgiveness, then severity itself will\nrelent to compassion, and justice be to thee an indulgent mother. She\nwill shut one eye upon your horrible crimes, and be satisfied--only\nthink!--to let you be broken on the wheel.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Did you hear that, captain? Shall I throttle this\nwell-trained shepherd's cur till the red blood spurts from every pore?\n\nROLLER. Captain! Fire and fury! Captain! How he bites his lip!\nShall I topple this fellow upside down like a ninepin?\n\nSCHWEITZER. Mine, mine be the job! Let me kneel to you, captain; let\nme implore you! I beseech you to grant me the delight of pounding him\nto a jelly! (FATHER DOMINIC screams.)\n\nCHARLES. Touch him not! Let no one lay a finger on him!--(To FATHER\nDOMINIC, drawing his sword.) Hark ye, sir father! Here stand\nnine-and-seventy men, of whom I am the captain, and not one of them has\nbeen taught to trot at a signal, or learned to dance to the music of\nartillery; while yonder stand seventeen hundred men grown gray under the\nmusket. But now listen! Thus says Moor, the captain of incendiaries. It\nis true I have slain a count of the empire, burnt and plundered the\nchurch of St. Dominic, flung firebrands into your bigoted city, and\nbrought down the powder-magazine upon the heads of devout Christians. But\nthat is not all,--I have done more. (He holds out his right hand.) Do you\nobserve these four costly rings, one on each finger? Go and report\npunctually to their worships, on whose sentence hangs life or death what\nyou shall hear and see. This ruby I drew from the finger of a minister,\nwhom I stretched at the feet of his prince, during the chase. He had\nfawned himself up from the lowest dregs, to be the first favorite;--the\nruin of his neighbor was his ladder to greatness--orphans' tears helped\nhim to mount it. This diamond I took from a lord treasurer, who sold\noffices of honor and trust to the highest bidder, and drove the sorrowing\npatriot from his door. This opal I wear in honor of a priest of your\ncloth, whom I dispatched with my own hand, after he had publicly deplored\nin his pulpit the waning power of the Inquisition. I could tell you more\nstories about my rings, but that I repent the words I have already wasted\nupon you--\n\nFATHER DOM. O Pharaoh! Pharaoh!\n\nCHARLES. Do you hear it? Did you mark that sigh? Does he not stand\nthere as if he were imploring fire from heaven to descend and destroy\nthis troop of Korah? He pronounces judgment with a shrug of the\nshoulders, and eternal damnation with a Christian \"Alas!\" Is it\npossible for humanity to be so utterly blind? He who has the hundred\neyes of Argus to spy out the faults of his brother--can he be so totally\nblind to his own? They thunder forth from their clouds about gentleness\nand forbearance, while they sacrifice human victims to the God of love\nas if he were the fiery Moloch. They preach the love of one's neighbor,\nwhile they drive the aged and blind with curses from their door. They\nrave against covetousness; yet for the sake of gold they have\ndepopulated Peru, and yoked the natives, like cattle, to their chariots.\nThey rack their brains in wonder to account for the creation of a Judas\nIscariot, yet the best of them would betray the whole Trinity for ten\nshekels. Out upon you, Pharisees! ye falsifiers of truth! ye apes of\nDeity! You are not ashamed to kneel before crucifixes and altars; you\nlacerate your backs with thongs, and mortify your flesh with fasting;\nand with these pitiful mummeries you think, fools as you are, to veil\nthe eyes of Him whom, with the same breath, you address as the\nOmniscient, just as the great are the most bitterly mocked by those who\nflatter them while they pretend to hate flatterers. You boast of your\nhonesty and your exemplary conduct; but the God who sees through your\nhearts would be wroth with Him that made you, were He not the same that\nhad also created the monsters of the Nile. Away with him out of my\nsight!\n\nFATHER DOM. That such a miscreant should be so proud!\n\nCHARLES. That's not all. Now I will speak proudly. Go and tell the\nright worshipful justices--who set men's lives upon the cast of a die--\nI am not one of those thieves who conspire with sleep and midnight, and\nplay the hero and the lordling on a scaling-ladder. What I have done I\nshall no doubt hereafter be doomed to read in the register of heaven;\nbut with his miserable ministers of earth I will waste no more words.\nTell your masters that my trade is retribution--vengeance my occupation!\n(He turns his back upon him.)\n\nFATHER DOM. Then you despise mercy and forbearance?---Be it so, I have\ndone with you. (Turning to the troop.) Now then, sirs, you shall hear\nwhat the high powers direct me to make known to you!--If you will\ninstantly deliver up to me this condemned malefactor, bound hand and\nfoot, you shall receive a full pardon--your enormities shall be entirely\nblotted out, even from memory. The holy church will receive you, like\nlost sheep, with renewed love, into her maternal bosom, and the road to\nhonorable employment shall be open to you all. (With a triumphant\nsmile.) Now sir! how does your majesty relish this? Come on! bind him!\nand you are free!\n\nCHARLES. Do you hear that? Do you hear it? What startles you? Why do\nyou hesitate? They offer you freedom--you that are already their\nprisoners. They grant you your lives, and that is no idle pretence, for\nit is clear you are already condemned felons. They promise you honor\nand emolument; and, on the other hand, what can you hope for, even\nshould you be victorious to-day, but disgrace, and curses, and\npersecution? They ensure you the pardon of Heaven; you that are\nactually damned. There is not a single hair on any of you that is not\nalready bespoke in hell. Do you still hesitate? are you staggered? Is\nit so difficult, then, to choose between heaven and hell?--Do put in a\nword, father!\n\nFATHER DOM. (aside.) Is the fellow crazy? (Aloud.) Perhaps you are\nafraid that this is a trap to catch you alive?--Read it yourselves!\nHere--is the general pardon fully signed. (He hands a paper to\nSCHWEITZER.) Can you still doubt?\n\nCHARLES. Only see! only see! What more can you require? Signed with\ntheir own hands! It is mercy beyond all bounds! Or are you afraid of\ntheir breaking their word, because you have heard it said that no faith\nneed be kept with traitors? Dismiss that fear! Policy alone would\nconstrain them to keep their word, even though it should merely have\nbeen pledged to old Nick. Who hereafter would believe them? How could\nthey trade with it a second time? I would take my oath upon it that\nthey mean it sincerely. They know that I am the man who has goaded you\non and incited you; they believe you innocent. They look upon your\ncrimes as so many juvenile errors--exuberances of rashness. It is I\nalone they want. I must pay the penalty. Is it not so, father?\n\nFATHER DOM. What devil incarnate is it that speaks out of him? Of\ncourse it is so--of course. The fellow turns my brain.\n\nCHARLES. What! no answer yet? Do you think it possible to cut your way\nthrough yon phalanx? Only look round you! just look round! You surely\ndo not reckon upon that; that were indeed a childish conceit--Or do you\nflatter yourselves that you will fall like heroes, because you saw that\nI rejoiced in the prospect of the fight? Oh, do not console yourself\nwith the thought! You are not MOOR. You are miserable thieves!\nwretched tools of my great designs! despicable as the rope in the hand\nof the hangman! No! no! Thieves do not fall like heroes. Life must be\nthe hope of thieves, for something fearful has to follow. Thieves may\nwell be allowed to quake at the fear of death. Hark! Do you hear their\nhorns echoing through the forest? See there! how their glittering\nsabres threaten! What! are you still irresolute? are you mad? are you\ninsane? It is unpardonable. Do you imagine I shall thank you for my\nlife? I disdain your sacrifice!\n\nFATHER DOM. (in utter amazement). I shall go mad! I must be gone!\nWas the like ever heard of?\n\nCHARLES. Or are you afraid that I shall stab myself, and so by suicide\nput an end to the bargain, which only holds good if I am given up alive?\nNo, comrades! that is a vain fear. Here, I fling away my dagger, and my\npistols, and this phial of poison, which might have been a treasure to\nme. I am so wretched that I have lost the power even over my own life.\nWhat! still in suspense? Or do you think, perhaps, that I shall stand\non my defence when you try to seize me? See here! I bind my right hand\nto this oak-branch; now I am quite defenceless, a child may overpower\nme. Who is the first to desert his captain in the hour of need?\n\nROLLER (with wild energy). And what though hell encircle us with\nninefold coils! (Brandishing his sword.) Who is the coward that will\nbetray his captain?\n\nSCHWEITZER (tears the pardon and flings the pieces into FATHER DOMINIC'S\nface). Pardon be in our bullets! Away with thee, rascal! Tell your\nsenate that you could not find a single traitor in all Moor's camp.\nHuzza! Huzza! Save the captain!\n\nALL (shouting). Huzza! Save the captain! Save him! Save our noble\ncaptain!\n\nCHARLES (releasing his hand from the tree, joyfully). Now we are free,\ncomrades! I feel a host in this single arm! Death or liberty! At the\nleast they shall not take a man of us alive!\n\n      [They sound the signal for attack; noise and tumult.\n            Exeunt with drawn swords.]\n\n\n\n\n                 ACT III.\n\n      SCENE I.--AMELIA in the garden, playing the guitar.\n\n     Bright as an angel from Walhalla's hall,\n      More beautiful than aught of earth was he!\n     Heaven-mild his look, as sunbeams when they fall,\n      Reflected from a calm cerulean sea.\n\n     His warm embrace--oh, ravishing delight!\n      With heart to heart the fiery pulses danced--\n     Our every sense wrap'd in ecstatic night--\n      Our souls in blissful harmony entranced.\n\n     His kisses--oh, what paradise of feeling!\n      E'en as two flames which round each other twine--\n     Or flood of seraph harp-tones gently stealing\n      In one soft swell, away to realms divine!\n\n     They rushed, commingled, melted, soul in soul!\n      Lips glued to lips, with burning tremor bound!\n     Cold earth dissolved, and love without control\n      Absorbed all sense of worldly things around!\n\n     He's gone!--forever gone! Alas! in vain\n      My bleeding heart in bitter anguish sighs;\n     To me is left alone this world of pain,\n      And mortal life in hopeless sorrow dies.\n\n\n               Enter FRANCIS.\n\nFRANCIS. Here again already, perverse enthusiast? You stole away from\nthe festive banquet, and marred the mirthful pleasures of my guests.\n\nAMELIA. 'Tis pity, truly, to mar such innocent pleasures! Shame on\nthem! The funeral knell that tolled over your father's grave must still\nbe ringing in your ears--\n\nFRANCIS. Wilt thou sorrow, then, forever? Let the dead sleep in peace,\nand do thou make the living happy! I come--\n\nAMELIA. And when do you go again?\n\nFRANCIS. Alas! Look not on me thus sorrowfully! You wound me, Amelia.\nI come to tell you--\n\nAMELIA. To tell me, I suppose, that Francis von Moor has become lord\nand master here.\n\nFRANCIS. Precisely so; that is the very subject on which I wish to\ncommunicate with you. Maximilian von Moor is gone to the tomb of his\nancestors. I am master. But I wish--to be so in the fullest sense,\nAmelia. You know what you have been to our house always regarded as\nMoor's daughter, his love for you will survive even death itself; that,\nassuredly, you will never forget?\n\nAMELIA. Never, never! Who could be so unfeeling as to drown the memory\nof it in festive banqueting?\n\nFRANCIS. It is your duty to repay the love of the father to his sons;\nand Charles is dead. Ha! you are struck with amazement; dizzy with the\nthought! To be sure 'tis a flattering and an elating prospect which may\nwell overpower the pride of a woman. Francis tramples under foot the\nhopes of the noblest and the richest, and offers his heart, his hand,\nand with them all his gold, his castles, and his forests to a poor, and,\nbut for him, destitute orphan. Francis--the feared--voluntarily\ndeclares himself Amelia's slave!\n\nAMELIA. Why does not a thunderbolt cleave the impious tongue which\nutters the criminal proposal! Thou hast murdered my beloved Charles;\nand shall Amelia, his betrothed, call thee husband? Thou?\n\nFRANCIS. Be not so violent, most gracious princess! It is true that\nFrancis does not come before you like a whining Celadon--'tis true he\nhas not learned, like a lovesick swain of Arcadia, to sigh forth his\namorous plaints to the echo of caves and rocks. Francis speaks--and,\nwhen not answered, commands!\n\nAMELIA. Commands? thou reptile! Command me? And what if I laughed\nyour command to scorn?\n\nFRANCIS. That you will hardly do. There are means, too, which I know\nof, admirably adapted to humble the pride of a capricious, stubborn\ngirl--cloisters and walls!\n\nAMELIA. Excellent! delightful! to be forever secure within cloisters\nand walls from thy basilisk look, and to have abundant leisure to think\nand dream of Charles. Welcome with your cloister! welcome your walls!\n\nFRANCIS. Ha! Is that it? Beware! Now you have taught me the art of\ntormenting you. The sight of me shall, like a fiery-haired fury, drive\nout of your head these eternal phantasies of Charles. Francis shall be\nthe dread phantom ever lurking behind the image of your beloved, like\nthe fiend-dog that guards the subterranean treasure. I will drag you to\nchurch by the hair, and sword in hand wring the nuptial vow from your\nsoul. By main force will I ascend your virginal couch, and storm your\nhaughty modesty with still greater haughtiness.\n\nAMELIA (gives him a slap in the face). Then take that first by way of\ndowry!\n\nFRANCIS. Ha! I will be tenfold, and twice tenfold revenged for this!\nMy wife! No, that honor you shall never enjoy. You shall be my\nmistress, my strumpet! The honest peasant's wife shall point her finger\nat you as she passes you in the street. Ay, gnash your teeth as\nfiercely as you please--scatter fire and destruction from your eyes--\nthe fury of a woman piques my fancy--it makes you more beautiful, more\ntempting. Come, this resistance will garnish my triumph, and your\nstruggles give zest to my embraces. Come, come to my chamber--I burn\nwith desire. Come this instant. (Attempts to drag her away).\n\nAMELIA (falls on his neck). Forgive me, Francis! (As he is about to\nclasp her in his arms, she suddenly draws the sword at his side, and\nhastily disengages herself). Do you see now, miscreant, how I am able\nto deal with you? I am only a woman, but a woman enraged. Dare to\napproach, and this steel shall strike your lascivious heart to the core\n--the spirit of my uncle will guide my hand. Avaunt, this instant!\n(She drives him away).\n\nAh! how different I feel! Now I breathe again--I feel strong as the\nsnorting steed, ferocious as the tigress when she springs upon the\nruthless destroyer of her cubs. To a cloister, did he say? I thank\nthee for the happy thought! Now has disappointed love found a place of\nrefuge--the cloister--the Redeemer's bosom is the sanctuary of\ndisappointed love. (She is on the point going).\n\n        . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nIn the acting edition the following scene occurs between Herman and\nFrancis, immediately before that with Amelia. As Schiller himself\nthought this among the happiest of his additions, and regretted that it\nwas \"entirely and very unfortunately overlooked in the first edition,\"\nit seems desirable to introduce it here as well as the soliloquy\nimmediately following, which has acquired some celebrity.\n\n\n\n                SCENE VIII.\n\n               Enter HERMANN.\n\nFRANCIS. Ha! Welcome, my Euryalus! My prompt and trusty instrument!\n\nHERMANN (abruptly and peevishly). You sent for me, count--why?\n\nFRANCIS. That you might put the seal to your master-piece.\n\nHERMANN (gruffly). Indeed?\n\nFRANCIS. Give the picture its finishing touch.\n\nHERMANN. Poh! Poh!\n\nFRANCIS (startled). Shall I call the carriage? We'll arrange the\nbusiness during the drive?\n\nHERMANN (scornfully). No ceremony, sir, if you please. For any\nbusiness we may have to arrange there is room enough between these four\nwalls. At all events I'll just say a few words to you by way of\npreface, which may save your lungs some unnecessary exertion.\n\nFRANCIS (reservedly). Hum! And what may those words be?\n\nHERMANN (with bitter irony). \"You shall have Amelia--and that from my\nhand--\"\n\nFRANCIS (with astonishment). Hermann!\n\nHERMANN (as before, with his back turned on FRANCIS). \"Amelia will\nbecome the plaything of my will--and you may easily guess the rest-in\nshort all will go as we wish\" (Breaks into an indignant laugh, and then\nturns haughtily to FRANCIS.) Now, Count von Moor, what have you to say\nto me?\n\nFRANCIS (evasively). To thee? Nothing. I had something to say to\nHermann.--\n\nHERMANN, No evasion. Why was I sent for hither? Was it to be your dupe\na second time! and to hold the ladder for a thief to mount? to sell my\nsoul for a hangman s fee? What else did you want with me?\n\nFRANCIS (as if recollecting). Ha! It just occurs to me! We must not\nforget the main point. Did not my steward mention it to you? I wanted\nto talk to you about the dowry.\n\nHERMANN. This is mere mockery sir; or, if not mockery, something worse.\nMoor, take care of yourself-beware how you kindle my fury, Moor. We are\nalone! And I have still an unsullied name to stake against yours!\nTrust not the devil, although he be of your own raising.\n\nFRANCIS (with dignity). Does this deportment become thee towards thy\nsovereign and gracious master? Tremble, slave!\n\nHERMANN (ironically). For fear of your displeasure, I suppose? What\nsignifies your displeasure to a man who is at war with himself? Fie,\nMoor. I already abhor you as a villain; let me not despise you for a\nfool. I can open graves, and restore the dead to life! Which of us now\nis the slave?\n\nFRANCIS (in a conciliating tone). Come, my good friend, be discreet,\nand do not prove faithless.\n\nHERMANN. Pshaw! To expose a wretch like you is here the best\ndiscretion--to keep faith with you would be an utter want of sense.\nFaith? with whom? Faith with the prince of liars? Oh, I shudder at the\nthought of such faith. A very little timely faithlessness would have\nalmost made a saint of me. But patience! patience! Revenge is cunning\nin resources.\n\nFRANCIS. Ah, by-the-by, I just remember. You lately lost a purse with\na hundred louis in it, in this apartment. I had almost forgotten it.\nHere, my good friend! take back what belongs to you. (Offers him a\npurse).\n\nHERMANN (throws it scornfully at his feet). A curse on your Judas\nbribe! It is the earnest-money of hell. You once before thought to\nmake my poverty a pander to my conscience--but you were mistaken, count!\negregiously mistaken. That purse of gold came most opportunely--to\nmaintain certain persons.\n\nFRANCIS (terrified). Hermann! Hermann! Let me not suspect certain\nthings of you. Should you have done anything contrary to my\ninstructions--you would be the vilest of traitors!\n\nHERMANN (exultingly). Should I? Should I really? Well then count,\nlet me give you a little piece of information! (Significantly.) I will\nfatten up your infamy, and add fuel to your doom. The book of your\nmisdeeds shall one day be served up as a banquet, and all the world be\ninvited to partake of it. (Contemptuously.) Do you understand me now,\nmy most sovereign, gracious, and excellent master?\n\nFRANCIS (starts up, losing all command of himself). Ha! Devil!\nDeceitful impostor! (Striking his forehead.) To think that I should\nstake my fortune on the caprice of an idiot! That was madness! (Throws\nhimself, in great excitement, on a couch.)\n\nHERMANN (whistles through his fingers). Wheugh! the biter bit!--\n\nFRANCIS (biting his lip). But it is true, and ever will be true--that\nthere is no thread so feebly spun, or which snaps asunder so readily, as\nthat which weaves the bands of guilt!--\n\nHERMANN. Gently! Gently! Are angels, then, superseded, that devils\nturn moralists?\n\nFRANCIS (starts up abruptly; to HERMANN with a malignant laugh). And\ncertain persons will no doubt acquire much honor by making the\ndiscovery?\n\nHERMANN (clapping his hands). Masterly! Inimitable! You play your\npart to admiration! First you lure the credulous fool into the slough,\nand then chuckle at the success of your malice, and cry \"Woe be to you\nsinner!\" (Laughing and clenching his teeth.) Oh, how cleverly these\nimps off the devil manoeuvre. But, count (clapping him on the shoulder)\nyou have not yet got your lesson quite perfect--by Heavens! You first\nlearn what the losing gamester will hazard. Set fire to the\npowder-magazine, says the pirate, and blow all to hell--both friend\nand foe!\n\nFRANCIS (runs to the wall, and takes down a pistol). Here is treason!\nI must be resolute--\n\nHERMANN (draws a pistol as quickly from his pocket, and presents it at\nhim). Don't trouble yourself--one must be prepared for everything with\nyou.\n\nFRANCIS (lets the pistol fall, and throws himself on the sofa in great\nconfusion). Only keep my council till--till I have collected my\nthoughts.\n\nHERMANN. I suppose till you have hired a dozen assassins to silence my\ntongue forever! Is it not so! But (in his ear) the secret is committed\nto paper, which my heirs will publish.\n                            [Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n                SCENE IX.\n\n               FRANCIS, solus.\n\nFrancis! Francis! Francis! What is all this? Where was thy courage?\nwhere thy once so fertile wit? Woe! Woe! And to be betrayed by thy\nown instruments! The pillars of my good fortune are tottering to their\nfall, the fences are broken down, and the raging enemy is already\nbursting in upon me. Well! this calls for some bold and sudden resolve!\nWhat if I went in person--and secretly plunged this sword in his body?\nA wounded man is but a child. Quick! I'll do it. (He walks with a\nresolute step to the end of the stage, but stops suddenly as if overcome\nby sensations of horror). Who are these gliding behind me? (Rolling\nhis eyes fearfully) Faces such as I have never yet beheld. What\nhideous yells do I hear! I feel that I have courage--courage! oh yes to\noverflowing! But if a mirror should betray me? or my shadow! or the\nwhistling of the murderous stroke! Ugh! Ugh! How my hair bristles! A\nshudder creeps through my frame. (He lets a poigniard fall from under\nhis clothes.) I am no coward--perhaps somewhat too tenderhearted. Yes!\nthat is it! These are the last struggles of expiring virtue. I revere\nthem. I should indeed be a monster were I to become the murderer of my\nown brother. No! no! no! That thought be far from me! Let me cherish\nthis vestige of humanity. I will not murder. Nature, thou hast\nconquered. I still feel something here that seems like--affection. He\nshall live.\n                            [Exit.]\n\n             Enter HERMANN, timidly.\n\nHERMANN. Lady Amelia! Lady Amelia!\n\nAMELIA. Unhappy man! why dost thou disturb me?\n\nHERMANN. I must throw this weight from my soul before it drags it down\nto hell. (Falls down before her.) Pardon! pardon! I have grievously\ninjured you, Lady Amelia!\n\nAMELIA. Arise! depart! I will hear nothing. (Going.)\n\nHERMANN (detaining her). No; stay! In the name of Heaven! In the name\nof the Eternal! You must know all!\n\nAMELIA. Not another word. I forgive you. Depart in peace. (In the\nact of going.)\n\nHERMANN. Only one word--listen; it will restore all your peace of mind.\n\nAMELIA (turning back and looking at him with astonishment). How,\nfriend? Who in heaven or on earth can restore my peace of mind?\n\nHERMANN. One word from my lips can do it. Hear me!\n\nAMELIA (seizing his hand with compassion). Good sir! Can one word from\nthy lips burst asunder the portals of eternity?\n\nHERMANN. (rising). Charles lives!\n\nAMELIA (screaming). Wretch!\n\nHERMANN. Even so. And one word more. Your uncle--\n\nAMELIA. (rushing upon him). Thou liest!\n\nHERMANN. Your uncle--\n\nAMELIA. Charles lives?\n\nHERMANN. And your uncle--\n\nAMELIA. Charles lives?\n\nHERMANN. And your uncle too--betray me not!\n\n              (HERMANN runs off)\n\nAMELIA (stands a long while like one petrified; after which she starts\nup wildly, and rushes after HERMANN.) Charles lives!\n\n\n\n\n          SCENE II.--Country near the Danube.\n\n     THE ROBBERS (encamped on a rising ground, under trees,\n           their horses are grazing below.)\n\nCHARLES. Here must I lie (throwing himself upon the ground). I feel as\nif my limbs were all shattered. My tongue is as dry as a potsherd\n(SCHWEITZER disappears unperceived.) I would ask one of you to bring me\na handful of water from that stream, but you are all tired to death.\n\nSCHWARZ. Our wine-flasks too are all empty.\n\nCHARLES. See how beautiful the harvest looks! The trees are breaking\nwith the weight of their fruit. The vines are full of promise.\n\nGRIMM. It is a fruitful year.\n\nCHARLES. Do you think so? Then at least one toil in the world will be\nrepaid. One? Yet in the night a hailstorm may come and destroy it all.\n\nSCHWARZ. That is very possible. It all may be destroyed an hour before\nthe reaping.\n\nCHARLES. Just what I say. All will be destroyed. Why should man\nprosper in that which he has in common with the ant, while he fails in\nthat which places him on a level with the gods. Or is this the aim and\nlimit of his destiny?\n\nSCHWARZ. I know not.\n\nCHARLES. Thou hast said well; and wilt have done better, if thou never\nseekest to know. Brother, I have looked on men, their insect cares and\ntheir giant projects,--their god-like plans and mouse-like occupations,\ntheir intensely eager race after happiness--one trusting to the\nfleetness of his horse,--another to the nose of his ass,--a third to his\nown legs; this checkered lottery of life, in which so many stake their\ninnocence and their leaven to snatch a prize, and,--blanks are all they\ndraw--for they find, too late, that there was no prize in the wheel. It\nis a drama, brother, enough to bring tears into your eyes, while it\nshakes your sides with laughter.\n\nSCHWARZ. How gloriously the sun is setting yonder!\n\nCHARLES (absorbed in the scene). So dies a hero! Worthy of adoration!\n\nSCHWARZ. You seem deeply moved.\n\nCHARLES. When I, was but a boy--it was my darling thought to live like\nhim, like him to die--(with suppressed grief.) It was a boyish thought!\n\nGRIMM. It was, indeed.\n\nCHARLES. There was a time--(pressing his hat down upon his face).\nI would be alone, comrades.\n\nSCHWARZ. Moor! Moor! Why, what the deuce! How his color changes.\n\nGRIMM. By all the devils! What ails him? Is he ill?\n\nCHARLES. There was a time when I could not have slept had I forgotten\nmy evening prayers.\n\nGRIMM. Are you beside yourself? Would you let the remembrances of your\nboyish years school you now?\n\nCHARLES (lays his head upon the breast of GRIMM). Brother! Brother!\n\nGRIMM. Come! Don't play the child--I pray you\n\nCHARLES. Oh that I were-that I were again a child!\n\nGRIMM. Fie! fie!\n\nSCHWARZ. Cheer up! Behold this smiling landscape--this delicious\nevening!\n\nCHARLES. Yes, friends, this world is very lovely--\n\nSCHWARZ. Come, now, that was well said.\n\nCHARLES. This earth so glorious!--\n\nGRIMM. Right--right--I love to hear you talk thus.\n\nCHARLES. (sinking back). And I so hideous in' this lovely world--\na monster on this glorious earth!\n\nGRIMM. Oh dear! oh dear!\n\nCHARLES. My innocence! give me back my innocence! Behold, every living\nthing is gone forth to bask in the cheering rays of the vernal sun--why\nmust I alone inhale the torments of hell out of the joys of heaven? All\nare so happy, all so united in brotherly love, by the spirit of peace!\nThe whole world one family, and one Father above--but He not my father!\nI alone the outcast, I alone rejected from the ranks of the blessed--the\nsweet name of child is not for me--never for me the soul-thrilling\nglance of her I love--never, never the bosom friend's embrace--(starting\nback wildly)--surrounded by murderers--hemmed in by hissing vipers--\nriveted to vice with iron fetters--whirling headlong on the frail reed\nof sin to the gulf of perdition--amid the blooming flowers of a glad\nworld, a howling Abaddon!\n\nSCHWARZ (to the others). How strange! I never saw him thus before.\n\nCHARLES (with melancholy). Oh, that I might return again to my mother's\nwomb. That I might be born a beggar! I should desire no more,--no\nmore, oh heaven!--but that I might be like one of those poor laborers!\nOh, I would toil till the blood streamed down my temples--to buy myself\nthe luxury of one guiltless slumber--the blessedness of a single tear.\n\nGRIMM (to the others). A little patience--the paroxysm is nearly over.\n\nCHARLES. There was a time when my tears flowed so freely. Oh, those\ndays of peace! Dear home of my fathers--ye verdant halcyon vales!\nO all ye Elysian scenes of my childhood!--will you never return?--will\nyour delicious breezes never cool my burning bosom? Mourn with me,\nNature, mourn! They will never return! never will their delicious\nbreezes cool my burning bosom! They are gone! gone! irrevocably gone!\n\n         Enter SCHWEITZER with water in his hat.\n\nSCHWEITZER (offering him water in his hat). Drink, captain; here is\nplenty of water, and cold as ice.\n\nSCHWARZ. You are bleeding! What have you been doing?\n\nSCHWEITZER. A bit of a freak, you fool, which had well-nigh cost me two\nlegs and a neck. As I was frolicking along the steep sandbanks of the\nriver, plump, in a moment, the whole concern slid from under me, and I\nafter it, some ten fathoms deep;--there I lay, and, as I was recovering\nmy five senses, lo and behold, the most sparkling water in the gravel!\nNot so much amiss this time, said I to myself, for the caper I have cut.\nThe captain will be sure to relish a drink.\n\nCHARLES (returns him the hat and wipes his face). But you are covered\nwith mud, Schweitzer, and we can't see the scar which the Bohemian\nhorseman marked on your forehead--your water was good, Schweitzer--and\nthose scars become you well.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Bah! There's room for a score or two more yet.\n\nCHARLES. Yes, boys--it was a hot day's work--and only one man lost.\nPoor Roller! he died a noble death. A marble monument would be erected\nto his memory had he died in any other cause than mine. Let this\nsuffice. (He wipes the tears from his eyes.) How many, did you say, of\nthe enemy were left on the field?\n\nSCHWEITZER. A hundred and sixty huzzars, ninety-three dragoons, some\nforty chasseurs--in all about three hundred.\n\nCHARLES. Three hundred for one! Every one of you has a claim upon this\nhead. (He bares his head.) By this uplifted dagger! As my Soul liveth,\nI will never forsake you!\n\nSCHWEITZER. Swear not! You do not know but you may yet be happy, and\nrepent your oath.\n\nCHARLES. By the ashes of my Roller! I will never forsake you.\n\n               Enter KOSINSKY.\n\nKOSINSKY (aside). Hereabouts, they say, I shall find him. Ha! What\nfaces are these? Should they be--if these--they must be the men! Yes,\n'tis they,'tis they! I will accost them.\n\nSCHWARZ. Take heed! Who goes there?\n\nKOSINSKY. Pardon, sirs. I know not whether I am going right or wrong.\n\nCHARLES. Suppose right, whom do you take us to be?\n\nKOSINSKY. Men!\n\nSCHWEITZER. I wonder, captain, whether we have given any proof of that?\n\nKOSINSKY. I am in search of men who can look death in the face, and let\ndanger play around then like a tamed snake; who prize liberty above life\nor honor; whose very names, hailed by the poor and the oppressed, appal\nthe boldest, and make tyrants tremble.\n\nSCHWEITZER (to the Captain). I like that fellow. Hark ye, friend! You\nhave found your men.\n\nKOSINSKY. So I should think, and I hope soon to find them brothers.\nYou can direct me to the man I am looking for. 'Tis your captain, the\ngreat Count von Moor.\n\nSCHWEITZER (taking him warmly by the hand). There's a good lad. You\nand I must be chums.\n\nCHARLES (coming nearer). Do you know the captain?\n\nKOSINSKY. Thou art he!--in those features--that air--who can look at\nthee, and doubt it? (Looks earnestly at him for some time). I have\nalways wished to see the man with the annihilating look, as he sat on\nthe ruins of Carthage.* That wish is realized.\n\n   *[Alluding to Caius Marius. See Plutarch's Lives.]\n\nSCHWEITZER. A mettlesome fellow!--\n\nCHARLES. And what brings you to me?\n\nKOSINSKY. Oh, captain! my more than cruel fate. I have suffered\nshipwrecked on the stormy ocean of the world; I have seen all my fondest\nhopes perish; and nought remains to me but a remembrance of the bitter\npast, which would drive me to madness, were I not to drown it by\ndirecting my energies to new objects.\n\nCHARLES. Another arraignment of the ways of Providence! Proceed.\n\nKOSINSKY. I became a soldier. Misfortune still followed me in the\narmy. I made a venture to the Indies, and my ship was shivered on the\nrocks--nothing but frustrated hopes! At last, I heard tell far and wide\nof your valiant deeds, incendiarisms, as they called them, and I came\nstraightway hither, a distance of thirty leagues, firmly resolved to\nserve under you, if you will deign to accept my services. I entreat\nthee, noble captain, refuse me not!\n\nSCHWEITZER (with a leap into the air). Hurrah! Hurrah! Our Roller\nreplaced ten hundred-fold! An out-and-out brother cut-throat for our\ntroop.\n\nCHARLES. What is your name?\n\nKOSINSKY. Kosinsky.\n\nCHARLES. What? Kosinsky! And do you know that you are but a\nthoughtless boy, and are embarking on the most weighty passage of your\nlife as heedlessly as a giddy girl? You will find no playing at bowls\nor ninepins here, as you probably imagine.\n\nKOSINSKY. I understand you, sir. I am,'tis true, but four-and-twenty\nyears old, but I have seen swords glittering, and have heard balls\nwhistling around me.\n\nCHARLES. Indeed, young gentleman? And was it for this that you took\nfencing lessons, to run poor travellers through the body for the sake of\na dollar, or stab women in the back? Go! go! You have played truant to\nyour nurse because she shook the rod at you.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Why, what the devil, captain! what are you about? Do you\nmean to turn away such a Hercules? Does he not look as if he could\nbaste Marechal Saxe across the Ganges with a ladle?\n\nCHARLES. Because your silly schemes miscarry, you come here to turn\nrogue and assassin! Murder, boy, do you know the meaning of that word?\nYou may have slumbered in peace after cropping a few poppy-heads, but to\nhave a murder on your soul--\n\nKOSINSKY. All the murders you bid me commit be upon my head!\n\nCHARLES. What! Are you so nimble-witted? Do you take measure of a man\nto catch him by flattery? How do you know that I am not haunted by\nterrific dreams, or that I shall not tremble on my death-bed?--How much\nhave you already done of which you have considered the responsibility?\n\nKOSINSKY. Very little, I must confess; excepting this long journey to\nyou, noble count--\n\nCHARLES. Has your tutor let the story of Robin Hood--get into your\nhands? Such careless rascals ought to be sent to the galleys. And has\nit heated your childish fancy, and infected you with the mania of\nbecoming a hero? Are you thirsting for honor and fame? Would you buy\nimmortality by deeds of incendiarism? Mark me, ambitious youth! No\nlaurel blooms for the incendiary. No triumph awaits the victories of\nthe bandit--nothing but curses, danger, death, disgrace. Do you see the\ngibbet yonder on the hill?\n\nSPIEGEL (going up and down indignantly). Oh, how stupid! How\nabominably, unpardonably stupid! That's not the way. I went to work\nin a very different manner.\n\nKOSINSKY. What should he fear, who fears not death?\n\nCHARLES. Bravo! Capital! You have made good use of your time at\nschool; you have got your Seneca cleverly by heart. But, my good\nfriend, you will not be able with these fine phrases to cajole nature\nin the hour of suffering; they will never blunt the biting tooth of\nremorse. Ponder on it well, my son! (Takes him by the hand.) I advise\nyou as a father. First learn the depth of the abyss before you plunge\nheadlong into it. If in this world you can catch a single glimpse of\nhappiness--moments may come when you-awake,--and then--it may be too\nlate. Here you step out as it were beyond the pale of humanity--you\nmust either be more than human or a demon. Once more, my son! if but\na single spark of hope glimmer for you elsewhere, fly this fearful\ncompact, where nought but despair enters, unless a higher wisdom has so\nordained it. You may deceive yourself--believe me, it is possible to\nmistake that for strength of mind which in reality is nothing more than\ndespair. Take my counsel! mine! and depart quickly.\n\nKOSINSKY. No! I will not stir. If my entreaties fail to move you, hear\nbut the story of my misfortunes. And then you will force the dagger\ninto my hand as eagerly as you now seek to withhold it. Seat yourselves\nawhile on the grass and listen.\n\nCHARLES. I will hear your story.\n\nKOSINSKY. Know, then, that I am a Bohemian nobleman. By the early\ndeath of my father I became master of large possessions. The scene of\nmy domain was a paradise; for it contained an angel--a maid adorned with\nall the charms of blooming youth, and chaste as the light of heaven.\nBut to whom do I talk of this? It falls unheeded on your cars--ye never\nloved, ye were never beloved--\n\nSCHWEITZER. Gently, gently! The captain grows red as fire.\n\nCHARLES. No more! I'll hear you some other time--to-morrow,--or\nby-and-by, or--after I have seen blood.\n\nKOSINSKY. Blood, blood! Only hear on! Blood will fill your whole\nsoul. She was of citizen birth, a German--but her look dissolved all\nthe prejudices of aristocracy. With blushing modesty she received the\nbridal ring from my hand, and on the morrow I was to have led my AMELIA\nto the altar. (CHARLES rises suddenly.) In the midst of my intoxicating\ndream of happiness, and while our nuptials were preparing, an express\nsummoned me to court. I obeyed the summons. Letters were shown me\nwhich I was said to have written, full of treasonable matter. I grew\nscarlet with indignation at such malice; they deprived me of my sword,\nthrust me into prison, and all my senses forsook me.\n\nSCHWEITZER. And in the meantime--go on! I already scent the game.\n\nKOSINSKY. There I lay a whole month, and knew not what was taking\nplace. I was full of anxiety for my Amelia, who I was sure would suffer\nthe pangs of death every moment in apprehension of my fate. At last the\nprime minister makes his appearance,--congratulates me in honey-sweet\nwords on the establishment of my innocence,--reads to me a warrant of\ndischarge,--and returns me my sword. I flew in triumph to my castle, to\nthe arms of my Amelia, but she had disappeared! She had been carried\noff, it was said, at midnight, no one knew whither, and no eye had\nbeheld her since. A suspicion instantly flashed across my mind. I\nrushed to the capital--I made inquiries at court--all eyes were upon\nme,--no one would give me information. At last I discovered her through\na grated window of the palace--she threw me a small billet.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Did I not say so?\n\nKOSINSKY. Death and destruction! The contents were these! They had\ngiven her the choice between seeing me put to death, and becoming the\nmistress of the prince. In the struggle between honor and love she\nchose the latter, and (with a bitter smile) I was saved.\n\nSCHWEITZER. And what did you do then?\n\nKOSINSKY. Then I stood like one transfixed with a thunderbolt! Blood\nwas my first thought, blood my last! Foaming at the mouth, I ran to my\nquarters, armed myself with a two-edged sword, and, with all haste,\nrushed to the minister's house, for he--he alone--had been the fiendish\npander. They must have observed me in the street, for, as I went up, I\nfound all the doors fastened. I searched, I enquired. He was gone,\nthey said, to the prince. I went straight thither, but nobody there\nwould know anything about him. I return, force the doors, find the base\nwretch, and was on the point when five or six servants suddenly rushed\non me from behind, and wrenched the weapon from my hands.\n\nSCHWEITZER (stamping the ground). And so the fellow got off clear, and\nyou lost your labor?\n\nKOSINSKY. I was arrested, accused, criminally prosecuted, degraded,\nand--mark this--transported beyond the frontier, as a special favor. My\nestates were confiscated to the minister, and Amelia remained in the\nclutches of the tiger, where she weeps and mourns away her life, while\nmy vengeance must keep a fast, and crouch submissively to the yoke of\ndespotism.\n\nSCHWEITZER (rising and whetting his sword). That is grist to our mill,\ncaptain! There is something here for the incendiaries!\n\nCHARLES (who has been walking up and down in violent agitation, with a\nsudden start to the ROBBERS). I must see her. Up! collect your\nbaggage--you'll stay with us, Kosinsky! Quick, pack up!\n\nTHE ROBBERS. Where to? What?\n\nCHARLES. Where to? Who asks that question? (Fiercely to SCHWEITZER)\nTraitor, wouldst thou keep me back? But by the hope for heaven!\n\nSCHWEITZER. I, a traitor? Lead on to hell and I will follow you!\n\nCHARLES (falling on his neck). Dear brother! thou shalt follow me. She\nweeps, she mourns away her life. Up! quickly! all of you! to\nFranconia! In a week we must be there.\n                         [Exeunt.]\n\n\n\n\n                 ACT IV.\n\n       SCENE I.--Rural scenery in the neighborhood of\n            CHARLES VON MOOR'S castle.\n\n        CHARLES VON MOOR, KOSINSKY, at a distance.\n\nCHARLES. Go forward, and announce me. You remember what you have to\nsay?\n\nKOSINSKY. You are Count Brand, you come from Mecklenburg. I am your\ngroom. Do not fear, I shall take care to play my part. Farewell!\n                         [Exit.]\n\nCHARLES. Hail to thee, Earth of my Fatherland (kisses the earth.)\nHeaven of my Fatherland! Sun of my Fatherland! Ye meadows and hills,\nye streams and woods! Hail, hail to ye all! How deliciously the\nbreezes are wafted from my native hills? What streams of balmy perfume\ngreet the poor fugitive! Elysium! Realms of poetry! Stay, Moor, thy\nfoot has strayed into a holy temple. (Comes nearer.)\n\nSee there! the old swallow-nests in the castle yard!---and the little\ngarden-gate!--and this corner of the fence where I so often watched in\nambuscade to teaze old Towzer!--and down there in the green valley,\nwhere, as the great Alexander, I led my Macedonians to the battle of\nArbela; and the grassy hillock yonder, from which I hurled the Persian\nsatrap--and then waved on high my victorious banner! (He smiles.) The\ngolden age of boyhood lives again in the soul of the outcast. I was\nthen so happy, so wholly, so cloudlessly happy--and now--behold all my\nprospects a wreck! Here should I have presided, a great, a noble, an\nhonored man--here have--lived over again the years of boyhood in the\nblooming--children of my Amelia--here!--here have been the idol of my\npeople--but the foul fiend opposed it (Starting.) Why am I here? To\nfeel like the captive when the clanking of his chains awakes him from\nhis dream of liberty. No, let me return to my wretchedness! The\ncaptive had forgotten the light of day, but the dream of liberty flashes\npast his eyes like a blaze of lightning in the night, which leaves it\ndarker than before. Farewell, ye native vales! once ye saw Charles as a\nboy, and then Charles was happy. Now ye have seen the man his happiness\nturned to despair! (He moves rapidly towards the most distant point of\nthe landscape, where he suddenly stops and casts a melancholy look\nacross to the castle.) Not to behold her! not even one look?--and only\na wall between me and Amelia! No! see her I must!--and him too!--though\nit crush me! (He turns back.) Father! father! thy son approaches. Away\nwith thee, black, reeking gore! Away with that grim, ghastly look of\ndeath! Oh, give me but this one hour free! Amelia! Father! thy\nCharles approaches! (He goes quickly towards the castle.) Torment me\nwhen the morning dawns--give me no rest with the coming night--beset me\nin frightful dreams! But, oh! poison not this my only hour of bliss!\n(He is standing at the gate.) What is it I feel? What means this, Moor?\nBe a man! These death-like shudders--foreboding terrors.\n                            [Enters.]\n\n\n\n          SCENE II.*--Gallery in the Castle.\n\n       *[In some editions this is the third scene,\n       and there is no second.]\n\n           Enter CHARLES VON MOOR, AMELIA.\n\nAMELIA. And are you sure that you should know his portrait among these\npictures?\n\nCHARLES. Oh, most certainly! his image has always been fresh in my\nmemory. (Passing along thee pictures.) This is not it.\n\nAMELIA. You are right! He was the first count, and received his patent\nof nobility from Frederic Barbarossa, to whom he rendered some service\nagainst the corsairs.\n\nCHARLES (still reviewing the pictures). Neither is it this--nor this--\nnor that--it is not among these at all.\n\nAMELIA. Nay! look more attentively! I thought you knew him.\n\nCHARLES. As well as my own father! This picture wants the sweet\nexpression around the mouth, which distinguished him from among a\nthousand. It is not he.\n\nAMELIA. You surprise me. What! not seen him for eighteen years, and\nstill--\n\nCHARLES (quickly, with a hectic blush). Yes, this is he! (He stands as\nif struck by lightning.)\n\nAMELIA. An excellent man!\n\nCHARLES (absorbed in the contemplation of the picture). Father!\nfather! forgive me! Yes, an excellent man! (He wipes his eyes.) A\ngodlike man!\n\nAMELIA. You seem to take a deep interest in him.\n\nCHARLES. Oh, an excellent man! And he is gone, you say!\n\nAMELIA. Gone! as our best joys perish. (Gently taking him by the\nhand.) Dear Sir, no happiness ripens in this world.\n\nCHARLES. Most true, most true! And have you already proved this truth\nby sad experience? You, who can scarcely yet have seen your\ntwenty-third year?\n\nAMELIA. Yes, alas, I have proved it. Whatever lives, lives to die in\nsorrow. We engage our hearts, and grasp after the things of this world,\nonly to undergo the pang of losing them.\n\nCHARLES. What can you have lost, and yet so young?\n\nAMELIA. Nothing--everything--nothing. Shall we go on, count?*\n\n   *[In the acting edition is added--\n   \"MOOR. And would you learn forgetfulness in that holy garb there?\n   (Pointing to a nun's habit.)\n   \"AMELIA. To-morrow I hope to do so. Shall we continue our walk,\n   sir?\"]\n\nCHARLES. In such haste? Whose portrait is that on the right? There is\nan unhappy look about that countenance, methinks.\n\nAMELIA. That portrait on the left is the son of the count, the present\ncount. Come, let us pass on!\n\nCHARLES. But this portrait on the right?\n\nAMELIA. Will you not continue your walk, Sir?\n\nCHARLES. But this portrait on the right hand? You are in tears,\nAmelia? [Exit AMELIA, in precipitation.]\n\nCHARLES. She loves me, she loves me! Her whole being began to rebel,\nand the traitor tears rolled down her cheeks. She loves me! Wretch,\nhast thou deserved this at her hands? Stand I not here like a condemned\ncriminal before the fatal block? Is this the couch on which we so often\nsat--where I have hung in rapture on her neck? Are these my ancestral\nhalls? (Overcome by the sight of his father's portrait.) Thou--thou--\nFlames of fire darting from thine eyes--His curse--His curse--He disowns\nme--Where am I? My sight grows dim--Horrors of the living God--'Twas I,\n'twas I that killed my father!\n                        [He rushes off]\n\n         Enter FRANCIS VON MOOR, in deep thought.\n\nFRANCIS. Away with that image! Away with it! Craven heart! Why dost\nthou tremble, and before whom? Have I not felt, during the few hours\nthat the count has been within these walls as if a spy from hell were\ngliding at my heels. Methinks I should know him! There is something so\nlofty, so familiar, in his wild, sunburnt features, which makes me\ntremble. Amelia, too, is not indifferent towards him! Does she not\ndart eager, languishing looks at the fellow looks of which she is so\nchary to all the world beside? Did I not see her drop those stealthy\ntears into the wine, which, behind my back, he quaffed so eagerly that\nhe seemed to swallow the very glass? Yes, I saw it--I saw it in the\nmirror with my own eyes. Take care, Francis! Look about you! Some\ndestruction-brooding monster is lurking beneath all this! (He stops,\nwith a searching look, before the portrait of CHARLES.)\n\nHis long, crane-like neck--his black, fire-sparkling eyes--hem! hem!--\nhis dark, overhanging, bushy eyebrows. (Suddenly starting back.)\nMalicious hell! dost thou send me this suspicion? It is Charles! Yes,\nall his features are reviving before me. It is he! despite his mask!\nit is he! Death and damnation! (Goes up and down with agitated steps.)\nIs it for this that I have sacrificed my nights--that I have mowed down\nmountains and filled up chasms? For this that I have turned rebel\nagainst all the instincts of humanity? To have this vagabond outcast\nblunder in at last, and destroy all my cunningly devised fabric. But\ngently! gently! What remains to be done is but child's play. Have I\nnot already waded up to my very ears in mortal sin? Seeing how far the\nshore lies behind me, it would be madness to attempt to swim back. To\nreturn is now out of the question. Grace itself would be beggared, and\ninfinite mercy become bankrupt, were they to be responsible for all my\nliabilities. Then onward like a man. (He rings the bell.) Let him be\ngathered to the spirit of his father, and now come on! For the dead I\ncare not! Daniel! Ho! Daniel! I'd wager a trifle they have already\ninveigled him too into the plot against me! He looks so full of\nmystery!\n\n               Enter DANIEL.\n\nDANIEL. What is your pleasure, my master?\n\nFRANCIS. Nothing. Go, fill this goblet with wine, and quickly! (Exit\nDANIEL.) Wait a little, old man! I shall find you out! I will fix my\neye upon you so keenly that your stricken conscience shall betray itself\nthrough your mask! He shall die! He is but a sorry bungler who leaves\nhis work half finished, and then looks on idly, trusting to chance for\nwhat may come of it.\n\n            Enter DANIEL, with the wine.\n\nBring it here! Look me steadfastly in the face! How your knees knock\ntogether! How you tremble! Confess, old man! what have you been\ndoing?\n\nDANIEL. Nothing, my honored master, by heaven and my poor soul!\n\nFRANCIS. Drink this wine! What? you hesitate? Out with it quickly!\nWhat have you put into the wine?\n\nDANIEL. Heaven help me! What! I in the wine?\n\nFRANCIS. You have poisoned it! Are you not as white as snow? Confess,\nconfess! Who gave it you? The count? Is it not so? The count gave it\nyou?\n\nDANIEL. The count? Jesu Maria! The count has not given me anything.\n\nFRANCIS (grasping him tight). I will throttle you till you are black in\nthe face, you hoary-headed liar! Nothing? Why, then, are you so often\ncloseted together? He, and you, and Amelia? And what are you always\nwhispering about? Out with it! What secrets, eh? What secrets has he\nconfided to you?\n\nDANIEL. I call the Almighty to witness that he has not confided any\nsecrets to me.\n\nFRANCIS. Do you mean to deny it? What schemes have you been hatching\nto get rid of me? Am I to be smothered in my sleep? or is my throat to\nbe cut in shaving? or am I to be poisoned in wine or chocolate? Eh?\nOut with it, out with it! Or am I to have my quietus administered in my\nsoup? Out with it! I know it all!\n\nDANIEL. May heaven so help me in the hour of need as I now tell you the\ntruth, and nothing but the pure, unvarnished truth!\n\nFRANCIS. Well, this time I will forgive you. But the money! he most\ncertainly put money into your purse? And he pressed your hand more\nwarmly than is customary? something in the manner of an old\nacquaintance?\n\nDANIEL. Never, indeed, Sir.\n\nFRANCIS. He told you, for instance, that he had known you before? that\nyou ought to know him? that the scales would some day fall from your\neyes? that--what? Do you mean to say that he never spoke thus to you?\n\nDANIEL. Not a word of the kind.\n\nFRANCIS. That certain circumstances restrained him--that one must\nsometimes wear a mask in order to get at one's enemies--that he would be\nrevenged, most terribly revenged?\n\nDANIEL. Not a syllable of all this.\n\nFRANCIS. What? Nothing at all? Recollect yourself. That he knew the\nold count well--most intimately--that he loved him--loved him\nexceedingly--loved him like a son!\n\nDANIEL. Something of that sort I remember to have heard him say.\n\nFRANCIS (turning pale). Did he say so? did he really? How? let me\nhear! He said he was my brother?\n\nDANIEL (astonished). What, my master? He did not say that. But as\nLady Amelia was conducting him through the gallery--I was just dusting\nthe picture frames--he suddenly stood still before the portrait of my\nlate master, and seemed thunderstruck. Lady Amelia pointed it out, and\nsaid, \"An excellent man!\" \"Yes, a most excellent man!\" he replied,\nwiping a tear from his eye.\n\nFRANCIS. Hark, Daniel! You know I have ever been a kind master to you;\nI have given you food and raiment, and have spared you labor in\nconsideration of your advanced age.\n\nDANIEL. For which may heaven reward you! and I, on my part, have\nalways served you faithfully.\n\nFRANCIS. That is just what I was going to say. You have never in all\nyour life contradicted me; for you know much too well that you owe me\nobedience in all things, whatever I may require of you.\n\nDANIEL. In all things with all my heart, so it be not against God and\nmy conscience.\n\nFRANCIS. Stuff! nonsense! Are you not ashamed of yourself? An old\nman, and believe that Christmas tale! Go, Daniel! that was a stupid\nremark. You know that I am your master. It is on me that God and\nconscience will be avenged, if, indeed, there be a God and a conscience.\n\nDANIEL (clasping his hands together). Merciful Heaven!\n\nFRANCIS. By your obedience! Do you understand that word? By your\nobedience, I command you. With to-morrow's dawn the count must no\nlonger be found among the living.\n\nDANIEL. Merciful Heaven! and wherefore?\n\nFRANCIS. By your blind obedience! I shall rely upon you implicitly.\n\nDANIEL. On me? May the Blessed Virgin have mercy on me! On me? What\nevil, then, have I, an old man, done!\n\nFRANCIS. There is no time now for reflection; your fate is in my hands.\nWould you rather pine away the remainder of your days in the deepest of\nmy dungeons, where hunger shall compel you to gnaw your own bones, and\nburning thirst make you suck your own blood? Or would you rather eat\nyour bread in peace, and have rest in your old age?\n\nDANIEL. What, my lord! Peace and rest in my old age? And I a\nmurderer?\n\nFRANCIS. Answer my question!\n\nDANIEL. My gray hairs! my gray hairs!\n\nFRANCIS. Yes or no!\n\nDANIEL. No! God have mercy upon me!\n\nFRANCIS (in the act of going). Very well! you shall have need of it.\n(DANIEL detains him and falls on his knees before him.)\n\nDANIEL. Mercy, master! mercy!\n\nFRANCIS. Yes or no!\n\nDANIEL. Most gracious master! I am this day seventy-one years of age!\nand have honored my father and my mother, and, to the best of my\nknowledge, have never in the whole course of my life defrauded any one\nto the value of a farthing,--and I have adhered to my creed truly and\nhonestly, and have served in your house four-and-forty years, and am now\ncalmly awaiting a quiet, happy end. Oh, master! master! (violently\nclasping his knees) and would you deprive me of my only solace in death,\nthat the gnawing worm of an evil conscience may cheat me of my last\nprayer? that I may go to my long home an abomination in the sight of God\nand man? No, no! my dearest, best, most excellent, most gracious\nmaster! you do not ask that of an old man turned threescore and ten!\n\nFRANCIS. Yes or no! What is the use of all this palaver?\n\nDANIEL. I will serve you from this day forward more diligently than\never; I will wear out my old bones in your service like a common\nday-laborer; I will rise earlier and lie down later. Oh, and I will\nremember you in my prayers night and morning; and God will not reject\nthe prayer of an old man.\n\nFRANCIS. Obedience is better than sacrifice. Did you ever hear of the\nhangman standing upon ceremony when he was told to execute a sentence?\n\nDANIEL. That is very true? but to murder an innocent man--one--\n\nFRANCIS. Am I responsible to you? Is the axe to question the hangman\nwhy he strikes this way and not that? But see how forbearing I am. I\noffer you a reward for performing what you owe me in virtue of your\nallegiance.\n\nDANIEL. But, when I swore allegiance to you, I at least hoped that I\nshould be allowed to remain a Christian.\n\nFRANCIS. No contradiction! Look you! I give you the whole day to\nthink about it! Ponder well on it. Happiness or misery. Do you hear--\ndo you understand? The extreme of happiness or the extreme of misery!\nI can do wonders in the way of torture.\n\nDANIEL (after some reflection). I'll do it; I will do it to-morrow.\n                            [Exit.]\n\nFRANCIS. The temptation is strong, and I should think he was not born\nto die a martyr to his faith. Have with you, sir count! According to\nall ordinary calculations, you will sup to-morrow with old Beelzebub.\nIn these matters all depends upon one's view of a thing; and he is a\nfool who takes any view that is contrary to his own interest. A father\nquaffs perhaps a bottle of wine more than ordinary--he is in a certain\nmood--the result is a human being, the last thing that was thought of in\nthe affair. Well, I, too, am in a certain mood,--and the result is that\na human being perishes; and surely there is more of reason and purpose\nin this than there was in his production. If the birth of a man is the\nresult of an animal paroxysm, who should take it into his head to attach\nany importance to the negation of his birth? A curse upon the folly of\nour nurses and teachers, who fill our imaginations with frightful tales,\nand impress fearful images of punishment upon the plastic brain of\nchildhood, so that involuntary shudders shake the limbs of the man with\nicy fear, arrest his boldest resolutions, and chain his awakening reason\nin the fetters of superstitious darkness. Murder! What a hell full of\nfuries hovers around that word. Yet 'tis no more than if nature forgets\nto bring forth one man more or the doctor makes a mistake--and thus the\nwhole phantasmagoria vanishes. It was something, and it is nothing.\nDoes not this amount to exactly the same thing as though it had been\nnothing, and came to nothing; and about nothing it is hardly worth while\nto waste a word. Man is made of filth, and for a time wades in filth,\nand produces filth, and sinks back into filth, till at last he fouls the\nboots of his own posterity.*\n\n   *[\"To what base uses we may return, Horatio! why, may not\n   imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till we find it\n   stopping a bunghole?\"--HAMLET, Act v, Sc. 1.]\n\nThat is the burden of the song--the filthy cycle of human fate; and with\nthat--a pleasant journey to you, sir brother! Conscience, that\nsplenetic, gouty moralist, may drive shrivelled old drones out of\nbrothels, and torture usurers on their deathbeds--with me it shall never\nmore have audience.\n                            [Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n         SCENE III.--Another Room in the Castle.\n\n   CHARLES VON MOOR enters from one side, DANIEL from the other.\n\nCHARLES (hastily). Where is Lady Amelia?\n\nDANIEL. Honored sir! permit an old man to ask you a favor.\n\nCHARLES. It is granted. What is it you ask?\n\nDANIEL. Not much, and yet all--but little, and yet a great deal.\nSuffer me to kiss your hand!\n\nCHARLES. That I cannot permit, good old man (embraces him), from one\nwhom I should like to call my father.\n\nDANIEL. Your hand, your hand! I beseech you.\n\nCHARLES. That must not be.\n\nDANIEL. It must! (He takes hold of it, surveys it quickly, and falls\ndown before him.) Dear, dearest Charles!\n\nCHARLES (startled; he composes himself, and says in a distant tone).\nWhat mean you, my friend? I don't understand you.\n\nDANIEL. Yes, you may deny it, you may dissemble as much as you please?\n'Tis very well! very well. For all that you are my dearest, my\nexcellent young master. Good Heaven! that I, poor old man, should live\nto have the joy--what a stupid blockhead was I that I did not at a\nglance--oh, gracious powers! And you are really come back, and the dear\nold master is underground, and here you are again! What a purblind dolt\nI was, to be sure! (striking his forehead) that I did not on the\ninstant--Oh, dear me!---who could have dreamt it--What I have so often\nprayed for with tears--Oh, mercy me! There he stands again, as large as\nlife, in the old room!\n\nCHARLES. What's all this oration about? Are you in a fit of delirium,\nand have escaped from your keepers; or are you rehearsing a\nstage-player's part with me?\n\nDANIEL. Oh, fie! fie! It is not pretty of you to make game of an old\nservant. That scar! Eh! do you remember it? Good Heaven! what a\nfright you put me into--I always loved you so dearly; and what misery\nyou might have brought upon me. You were sitting in my lap--do you\nremember? there in the round chamber. Has all that quite vanished from\nyour memory--and the cuckoo, too, that you were so fond of listening to?\nOnly think! the cuckoo is broken, broken all to shivers--old Susan\nsmashed it in sweeping the room--yes, indeed, and there you sat in my\nlap, and cried, \"Cockhorse!\" and I ran off to fetch your wooden horse--\nmercy on me! what business had I, thoughtless old fool, to leave you\nalone--and how I felt as if I were in a boiling caldron when I heard you\nscreaming in the passage; and, when I rushed in, there was your red\nblood gushing forth, and you lying on the ground. Oh, by the Blessed\nVirgin! did I not feel as if a bucket of icy cold water was emptied all\nover me?--but so it happens, unless one keeps all one's eyes upon\nchildren. Good Heaven! if it had gone into your eye! Unfortunately it\nhappened to be the right hand. \"As long as I live,\" said I, \"never\nagain shall any child in my charge get hold of a knife or scissors, or\nany other edge tool.\" 'Twas lucky for me that both my master and\nmistress were gone on a journey. \"Yes, yes! this shall be a warning to\nme for the rest of my life,\" said I--Gemini, Gemini! I might have lost\nmy place, I might--God forgive you, you naughty boy--but, thank Heaven!\nit healed fairly, all but that ugly scar.\n\nCHARLES. I do not comprehend one word of all that you are talking\nabout.\n\nDANIEL. Eh? eh? that was the time! was it not? How many a ginger-cake,\nand biscuit, and macaroon, have I slipped into your hands--I was always\nso fond of you. And do you recollect what you said to me down in the\nstable, when I put you upon old master's hunter, and let you scamper\nround the great meadow? \"Daniel!\" said you, \"only wait till I am grown\na big man, and you shall be my steward, and ride in the coach with me.\"\n\"Yes,\" said I, laughing, \"if heaven grants me life and health, and you\nare not ashamed of the old man,\" I said, \"I shall ask you to let me have\nthe little house down in the village, that has stood empty so long; and\nthen I will lay in a few butts of good wine, and turn publican in my old\nage.\" Yes, you may laugh, you may laugh! Eh, young gentleman, have you\nquite forgotten all that? You do not want to remember the old man, so\nyou carry yourself strange and loftily;--but, you are my jewel of a\nyoung master, for all that. You have, it is true, been a little bit\nwild--don't be angry!--as young blood is apt to be! All may be well yet\nin the end.\n\nCHARLES (falls on his neck). Yes! Daniel! I will no longer hide it\nfrom you! I am your Charles, your lost Charles! And now tell me, how\ndoes my Amelia?\n\nDANIEL (begins to cry). That I, old sinner, should live to have this\nhappiness--and my late blessed master wept so long in vain! Begone,\nbegone, hoary old head! Ye weary bones, descend into the grave with\njoy! My lord and master lives! my own eyes have beheld him!\n\nCHARLES. And he will keep his promise to you. Take that, honest\ngraybeard, for the old hunter (forces a heavy purse upon him). I have\nnot forgotten the old man.\n\nDANIEL. How? What are you doing? Too much! You have made a mistake.\n\nCHARLES. No mistake, Daniel! (DANIEL is about to throw himself on his\nknees before him.) Rise! Tell me, how does my Amelia?\n\nDANIEL. Heaven reward you! Heaven reward you! O gracious me! Your\nAmelia will never survive it, she will die for joy?\n\nCHARLES (eagerly). She has not forgotten me then?\n\nDANIEL. Forgotten you? How can you talk thus? Forgotten you, indeed!\nYou should have been there, you should have seen how she took on, when\nthe news came of your death, which his honor caused to be spread\nabroad--\n\nCHARLES. What do you say? my brother--\n\nDANIEL. Yes, your brother; his honor, your brother--another day I will\ntell you more about it, when we have time--and how cleverly she sent him\nabout his business when he came a wooing every blessed day, and offered\nto make her his countess. Oh, I must go; I must go and tell her; carry\nher the news (is about to run of).\n\nCHARLES. Stay! stay! she must not know--nobody must know, not even my\nbrother!\n\nDANIEL. Your brother? No, on no account; he must not know it!\nCertainly not! If he know not already more than he ought to know. Oh,\nI can tell you, there are wicked men, wicked brothers, wicked masters;\nbut I would not for all my master's gold be a wicked servant. His honor\nthought you were dead.\n\nCHARLES. Humph! What are you muttering about?\n\nDANIEL (in a half-suppressed voice). And to be sure when a man rises\nfrom the dead thus uninvited--your brother was the sole heir of our late\nmaster!\n\nCHARLES. Old man! what is it you are muttering between your teeth, as\nif some dreadful secret were hovering on your tongue which you fear to\nutter, and yet ought? Out with it!\n\nDANIEL. But I would rather gnaw my old bones with hunger, and suck my\nown blood for thirst, than gain a life of luxury by murder.\n                          [Exit hastily.]\n\nCHARLES (starting up, after a terrible pause). Betrayed! Betrayed! It\nflashes upon my soul like lightning! A fiendish trick! A murderer and\na robber through fiend-like machinations! Calumniated by him! My\nletters falsified, suppressed! his heart full of love! Oh, what a\nmonstrous fool was I! His fatherly heart full of love! oh, villainy,\nvillainy! It would have cost me but once kneeling at his feet--a tear\nwould have done it--oh blind, blind fool that I was! (running up\nagainst the wall). I might have been happy--oh villainy, villainy!\n\nKnavishly, yes, knavishly cheated out of all happiness in this life!\n(He runs up and down in a rage.) A murderer, a robber, all through a\nknavish trick! He was not even angry! Not a thought of cursing ever\nentered his heart. Oh, miscreant! inconceivable, hypocritical,\nabominable miscreant!\n\n               Enter KOSINSKY.\n\nKOSINSKY. Well, captain, where are you loitering? What is the matter?\nYou are for staying here some time longer, I perceive?\n\nCHARLES. Up! Saddle the horses! Before sunset we must be over the\nfrontier!\n\nKOSINSKY. You are joking.\n\nCHARLES (in a commanding tone). Quick! quick! delay not! leave every\nthing behind! and let no eye see you!\n                         (Exit KOSINSKY.)\n\nI fly from these walls. The least delay might drive me raving mad; and\nhe my father's son! Brother! brother! thou hast made me the most\nmiserable wretch on earth; I never injured thee; this was not brotherly.\nReap the fruits of thy crime in quiet, my presence shall no longer\nembitter thy enjoyment--but, surely, this was not acting like a brother.\nMay oblivion shroud thy misdeed forever, and death not bring it back to\nlight.\n\n               Enter KOSINSKY.\n\nKOSINSKY. The horses are ready saddled, you can mount as soon as you\nplease.\n\nCHARLES. Why in such haste? Why so urgent? Shall I see her no more?\n\nKOSINSKY. I will take off the bridles again, if you wish it; you bade\nme hasten head over heels.\n\nCHARLES. One more farewell! one more! I must drain this poisoned cup\nof happiness to the dregs, and then--Stay, Kosinsky! Ten minutes more--\nbehind, in the castle yard--and we gallop off.\n\n\n\n\n            Scene IV.--In the Garden.\n\nAMELIA. \"You are in tears, Amelia!\" These were his very words--and\nspoken with such expressionsuch a voice!--oh, it summoned up a thousand\ndear remembrances!--scenes of past delight, as in my youthful days of\nhappiness, my golden spring-tide of love. The nightingale sung with the\nsame sweetness, the flowers breathed the same delicious fragrance, as\nwhen I used to hang enraptured on his neck.*\n\n   *[Here, in the acting edition, is added, 'Assuredly, if the spirits\n   of the departed wander among the living, then must this stranger be\n   Charles's angel!']\n\nHa! false, perfidious heart! And dost thou seek thus artfully to veil\nthy perjury? No, no! begone forever from my soul, thou sinful image!\nI have not broken my oath, thou only one! Avaunt, from my soul, ye\ntreacherous impious wishes! In the heart where Charles reigns no son\nof earth may dwell. But why, my soul, dost thou thus constantly, thus\nobstinately turn towards this stranger? Does he not cling to my heart\nin the very image of my only one! Is he not his inseparable companion\nin my thoughts? \"You are in tears, Amelia?\" Ha! let me fly from him!--\n--fly!--never more shall my eyes behold this stranger!\n                   [CHARLES opens the garden gate.]\n\nAMELIA (starting). Hark! hark! did I not hear the gate creak? (She\nperceives CHARLES and starts up.) He?--whither?--what? I am rooted to\nthe spot,--I can not fly! Forsake me not, good Heaven! No! thou shalt\nnot tear me from my Charles! My soul has no room for two deities, I am\nbut a mortal maid! (She draws the picture of CHARLES from her bosom.)\nThou, my Charles! be thou my guardian angel against this stranger, this\ninvader of our loves! At thee will I look, at thee, nor turn away my\neyes--nor cast one sinful look towards him! (She sits silent, her eyes\nfixed upon the picture.)\n\nCHARLES. You here, Lady Amelia?--and so sad? and a tear upon that\npicture? (AMELIA gives him no answer.) And who is the happy man for\nwhom these silver drops fall from an angel's eyes? May I be permitted\nto look at--(He endeavors to look at the picture.)\n\nAMELIA. No--yes--no!\n\nCHARLES (starting back). Ha--and does he deserve to be so idolized?\nDoes he deserve it?\n\nAMELIA. Had you but known him!\n\nCHARLES. I should have envied him.\n\nAMELIA. Adored, you mean.\n\nCHARLES. Ha!\n\nAMELIA. Oh, you would so have loved him?---there was so much, so much\nin his face--in his eyes--in the tone of his voice,--which was so like\nyours--that I love so dearly! (CHARLES casts his eyes down to the\nground.) Here, where you are standing, he has stood a thousand times--\nand by his side, one who, by his side, forgot heaven and earth. Here\nhis eyes feasted on nature's most glorious panorama,--which, as if\nconscious of his approving glance, seemed to increase in beauty under\nthe approbation of her masterpiece. Here he held the audience of the\nair captive with his heavenly music. Here, from this bush, he plucked\nroses, and plucked those roses for me. Here, here, he lay on my neck;\nhere he imprinted burning kisses on my lips, and the flowers hung their\nheads with pleasure beneath the foot-tread of the lovers.*\n\n   *[In the acting edition the scene changes materially at this point,\n   and the most sentimental part of the whole drama is transformed\n   into the most voluptuous. The stage direction here is,--(They give\n   way to their transports without control, and mingle their kisses.\n   MOOR hangs in ecstacy on her lips, while she sinks half delirious\n   on the couch.) O Charles! now avenge thyself; my vow is broken.\n\n   MOOR (tearing himself away from her, as if in frenzy). Can this be\n   hell that still pursues me! (Gazing on her.) I felt so happy!\n\n   AMELIA (perceiving the ring upon her finger, starts up from the\n   couch). What! Art thou still there--on that guilty hand? Witness\n   of my perjury. Away with thee! (She pulls the ring from her\n   finger and gives it to CHARLES.) Take it--take it, beloved\n   seducer! and with it what I hold most sacred--take my all--my\n   Charles! (She falls back upon the couch.)\n\n   MOOR (changes color). O thou Most High! was this thy almighty\n   will? It is the very ring I gave her in pledge of our mutual\n   faith. Hell be the grave of love! She has returned my ring.\n\n   AMELIA (terrified). Heavens! What is the matter? Your eyes roll\n   wildly, and your lips are pale as death! Ah! woe is me. And are\n   the pleasures of thy crime so soon forgotten?\n\n   MOOR (suppressing his emotion). 'Tis nothing! Nothing! (Raising\n   his eyes to heaven.) I am still a man! (He takes of his own ring\n   and puts it on AMELIA'S finger.) In return take this! sweet fury of\n   my heart! And with it what I hold most sacred--take my all--my\n   Amelia!\n\n   AMELIA (starting up). Your Amelia!\n\n   MOOR (mournfully). Oh, she was such a lovely maiden, and faithful\n   as an angel. When we parted we exchanged rings, and vowed eternal\n   constancy. She heard that I was dead--believed it--yet remained\n   constant to the dead. She heard again that I was living--yet\n   became faithless to the living. I flew into her arms--was happy\n   as--the blest in Paradise. Think what my heart was doomed to feel,\n   Amelia! She gave me back my ring--she took her own.\n\n   AMELIA (her eyes fixed on the earth in amazement). 'Tis strange,\n   most strange! 'Tis horrible!\n\n   MOOR. Ay, strange and horrible! My child, there is much--ay, much\n   for man to learn ere his poor intellect can fathom the decrees of\n   Him who smiles at human vows and weeps at human projects. My\n   Amelia is an unfortunate maiden!\n\n   AMELIA. Unfortunate! Because she rejected you?\n\n   MOOR. Unfortunate. Because she embraced the man she betrayed.\n\n   AMELIA (with melancholy tenderness). Oh, then, she is indeed\n   unfortunate! From my soul I pity her! She shall be my sister.\n   But there is another and a better world.\"]\n\n\nCHARLES. He is no more?\n\nAMELIA. He sails on troubled seas--Amelia's love sails with him. He\nwanders through pathless, sandy deserts--Amelia's love clothes the\nburning sand with verdure, and the barren shrubs with flowers. Southern\nsuits scorch his bare head, northern snows pinch his feet, tempestuous\nhail beats down on his temples, but Amelia's love lulls him to sleep in\nthe midst of the storm. Seas, and mountains, and skies, divide the\nlovers--but their souls rise above this prison-house of clay, and meet\nin the paradise of love. You appear sad, count!\n\nCHARLES. These words of love rekindle my love.\n\nAMELIA (pale). What? You love another? Alas! what have I said?\n\nCHARLES. She believed me dead, and in my supposed death she remained\nfaithful to me--she heard again that I was alive, and she sacrificed for\nme the crown of a saint. She knows that I am wandering in deserts, and\nroaming about in misery, yet her love follows me on wings through\ndeserts and through misery. Her name, too, like yours, is Amelia.\n\nAMELIA. How I envy your Amelia!\n\nCHARLES. Oh, she is an unhappy maid. Her love is fixed upon one who is\nlost--and it can never--never be rewarded.\n\nAMELIA. Say not so! It will be rewarded in heaven. Is it not agreed\nthat there is a better world, where mourners rejoice, and where lovers\nmeet again?\n\nCHARLES. Yes, a world where the veil is lifted--where the phantom love\nwill make terrible discoveries--Eternity is its name. My Amelia is an\nunhappy maid.\n\nAMELIA. Unhappy, and loves you?*\n\n   *[In the acting edition the scene closes with a different\n   denouement. Amelia here says, \"Are all unhappy who live with you,\n   and bear the name of Amelia.\n   \"CHARLES. Yes, all--when they think they embrace an angel, and\n   find in their arms--a murderer. Alas, for my Amelia! She is\n   indeed unfortunate.\n   \"AMELIA (with an expression of deep affliction). Oh, I must weep\n   for her.\n   \"CHARLES (grasping her hand, and pointing to the ring). Weep for\n   thyself.\n   \"AMELIA (recognizing the ring). Charles! Charles! O heaven and\n   earth!\n   (She sinks fainting; the scene closes.)\"]\n\n\nCHARLES. Unhappy, because she loves me! What if I were a murderer?\nHow, Lady Amelia, if your lover could reckon you up a murder for every\none of your kisses? Woe to my Amelia! She is an unhappy maid.\n\nAMELIA (gayly rising). Ha! What a happy maid am I! My only one is a\nreflection of Deity, and Deity is mercy and compassion! He could not\nbear to see a fly suffer. His soul is as far from every thought of\nblood as the sun is from the moon. (CHARLES suddenly turns away into a\nthicket, and looks wildly out into the landscape. AMELIA sings, playing\nthe guitar.)\n\n     Oh! Hector, wilt thou go forevermore,\n     Where fierce Achilles, on the blood-stained shore,\n      Heaps countless victims o'er Patroclus' grave?\n     Who then thy hapless orphan boy will rear,\n     Teach him to praise the gods and hurl the spear,\n      When thou art swallowed up in Xanthus' wave?\n\nCHARLES (silently tunes the guitar, and plays).\n\n     Beloved wife!--stern duty calls to arms\n     Go, fetch my lance! and cease those vain alarms!\n\n             [He flings the guitar away, and rushes off.]\n\n\n\n\n     SCENE V.--A neighboring forest. Night. An old ruined\n          castle in the centre of the scene.\n\n       The band of ROBBERS encamped on the ground.\n\n              The ROBBERS singing.\n\n        To rob, to kill, to wench, to fight,\n         Our pastime is, and daily sport;\n        The gibbet claims us morn and night,\n         So let's be jolly, time is short.\n\n        A merry life we lead, and free,\n         A life of endless fun;\n        Our couch is 'neath the greenwood tree,\n        Through wind and storm we gain our fee,\n         The moon we make our sun.\n        Old Mercury is our patron true,\n        And a capital chap for helping us through.\n\n        To-day we make the abbot our host,\n         The farmer rich to-morrow;\n        And where we shall get our next day's roast,\n         Gives us nor care nor sorrow.\n\n        And, when with Rhenish and rare Moselle\n         Our throats we have been oiling,\n        Our courage burns with a fiercer swell,\n        And we're hand and glove with the Lord of Hell,\n         Who down in his flames is broiling.\n\n        For fathers slain the orphans' cries,\n         The widowed mothers' moan and wail,\n        Of brides bereaved the whimpering sighs,\n         Like music sweet, our ears regale.\n\n        Beneath the axe to see them writhe,\n         Bellow like calves, fall dead like flies;\n        Such bonny sights, and sounds so blithe,\n         With rapture fill our ears and eyes.\n\n        And when at last our death-knell rings--\n         The devil take that hour!\n        Payment in full the hangman brings,\n         And off the stage we scour.\n        On the road a glass of good liquor or so,\n        Then hip! hip! hip! and away we go!\n\n\nSCHWEITZER. The night is far advanced, and the captain has not yet\nreturned.\n\nRAZ. And yet he promised to be back before the clock struck eight.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Should any harm have befallen him, comrades, wouldn't we\nkindle fires! ay, and murder sucking babes?\n\nSPIEGEL. (takes RAZMANN aside). A word in your ear, Razmann!\n\nSCHWARZ (to GRIMM). Should we not send out scouts?\n\nGRIMM. Let him alone. He no doubt has some feat in hand that will put\nus to shame.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Then you are out, by old Harry! He did not part from us\nlike one that had any masterpiece of roguery in view. Have you\nforgotten what he said as he marched us across the heath? \"The fellow\nthat takes so much as a turnip out of a field, if I know it, leaves his\nhead behind him, as true as my name is Moor.\" We dare not plunder.\n\nRAZ. (aside to SPIEGELBERG). What are you driving at? Speak plainer.\n\nSPIEGEL. Hush! hush! I know not what sort of a notion you and I have of\nliberty, that we should toil under the yoke like bullocks, while we are\nmaking such wonderful fine speeches about independence. I like it not.\n\nSCHWEITZER (to GRIMM). What crotchet has that swaggering booby got in\nhis numskull, I wonder?\n\nRAZ. (aside to SPIEGELBERG). Is it the captain you mean?--\n\nSPIEGEL. Hush! I tell you; hush! He has got his eavesdroppers all\naround us. Captain, did you say? Who made him captain over us? Has he\nnot, in fact, usurped that title, which by right belongs to me? What?\nIs it for this that we stake our lives--that we endure all the splenetic\ncaprices of fortunes--that we may in the end congratulate ourselves upon\nbeing the serfs of a slave? Serfs! When we might be princes? By\nheaven! Razmann, I could never brook it.\n\nSCHWEITZER (overhearing him--to the others). Yes--there's a hero for\nyou! He is just the man to do mighty execution upon frogs with stones.\nThe very breath of his nostrils, when he sneezes, would blow you through\nthe eye of a needle.\n\nSPIEGEL. (to RAZMANN). Yes--and for years I have been intent upon it.\nThere must be an alteration, Razmann. If you are the man I always took\nyou for--Razmann! He is missing--he is almost given up--Razmann--\nmethinks his hour is come. What? does not the color so much as mount to\nyour cheek when you hear the chimes of liberty ringing in your ears?\nHave you not courage enough to take the hint?\n\nRAZ. Ha! Satan! What bait art thou spreading for my soul?\n\nSPIEGEL. Does it take? Good! then follow me! I have marked in what\ndirection he slunk off. Come along! a brace of pistols seldom fail;\nand then--we shall be the first to strangle sucking babes. (He\nendeavors to draw him of.)\n\nSCHWEITZER (enraged, draws his sword). Ha! caitiff! I have overheard\nyou! You remind me, at the right moment, of the Bohemian forest! Were\nnot you the coward that began to quail when the cry arose, \"the enemy is\ncoming!\" I then swore by my soul--(They fight, SPIEGELBERG is killed.)\nTo the devil with thee, assassin!\n\nROBBERS (in agitation). Murder! murder!--Schweitzer!--Spiegelberg!--\nPart them!\n\nSCHWEITZER (throwing the sword on the body). There let him rot! Be\nstill, my comrades! Don't let such a trifle disturb you. The brute has\nalways been inveterate against the captain and has not a single scar on\nhis whole body. Once more, be still. Ha, the scoundrel! He would stab\na man behind his back--skulk and murder! Is it for this that the hot\nsweat has poured down us in streams? that we may sneak out of the world\nat last like contemptible wretches? The brute! Is it for this that we\nhave lived in fire and brimstone? To perish at last like rats?\n\nGRIMM. But what the devil, comrade, were you after? What were you\nquarreling about? The captain will be furious.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Be that on my head. And you, wretch (to RAZMANN) you were\nhis accomplice, you! Get out of my sight! Schufterle was another of\nyour kidney, but he has met his deserts in Switzerland--has been hanged,\nas the captain prophesied. (A shot is heard.)\n\nSCHWARZ (jumping up). Hark! a pistol shot! (Another shot is heard.)\nAnother! Hallo! the captain!\n\nGRIMM. Patience! If it be he, there will be a third. (The third shot\nis heard.)\n\nSCHWARZ. 'Tis he! 'Tis the captain! Absent yourself awhile,\nSchweitzer--till we explain to him! (They fire.)\n\n          Enter CHARLES VON MOOR and KOSINSKY.\n\nSCHWEITZER (running to meet them). Welcome, captain. I have been\nsomewhat choleric in your absence. (He conducts him to the corpse.) Be\nyou judge between him and me. He meant to waylay and assassinate you.\n\nROBBERS (in consternation). What; the captain?\n\nCHARLES (after fixing his eyes for some time upon the corpse, with a\nsudden burst of feeling). Oh, incomprehensible finger of the avenging\nNemesis! Was it not he whose siren song seduced me to be what I am?\nLet this sword be consecrated to the dark goddess of retribution! That\nwas not thy deed, Schweitzer.\n\nSCHWEITZER. By heaven, it was mine, though! and, as the devil lives,\nit is not the worst deed I have done in my time. (Turns away moodily.)\n\nCHARLES (absorbed in thought). I comprehend--Great Ruler in heaven--\nI comprehend. The leaves fall from the trees, and my autumn is come.\nRemove this object from my sight! (The corpse of SPIEGELBERG is carried\nout.)\n\nGRIMM. Give us your orders, captain! What shall we do next?\n\nCHARLES. Soon--very soon--all will be accomplished. Hand me my lute;\nI have lost myself since I have been there. My lute, I say--I must\nnurse up my strength again. Leave me!\n\nROBBERS. 'Tis midnight, captain.\n\nCHARLES. They were only stage tears after all. Let me bring to memory\nthe song of the old Roman, that my slumbering genius may wake up again.\nHand me my lute. Midnight, say you?\n\nSCHWARZ. Yes, and past, too! Our eyes are as heavy as lead. For three\ndays we have not slept a wink.\n\nCHARLES. What? does balmy sleep visit the eyes of murderers? Why doth\nit flee mine? I never was a coward, nor a villain. Lay yourselves to\nrest. At day-break we march.\n\nROBBERS. Good night, captain. (They stretch them selves on the ground\nand fall asleep.)\n\n\n       Profound silence. CHARLES VON MOOR takes up his\n              guitar, and plays.\n\n\nBRUTUS.\nOh, be ye welcome, realms of peace and rest!\nReceive the last of all the sons of Rome!\nFrom dread Philippi's field, where all the best\nFell bleeding in her cause, I wearied come.\nCassius, no more! And Rome now prostrate laid!\nMy brethren all lie weltering in their gore!\nNo refuge left but Hades' gloomy shade;\nNo hope remains!--No world for Brutus more!\n\nCAESAR.\nWho's he that, with a hero's lofty bearing,\nComes striding o'er yon mountain's rocky bed?\nUnless my eyes deceive, that noble daring\nBespeaks the Roman warrior's fearless tread.\nWhence, son of Tiber, do thy footsteps bend!\nSay, stands the seven-hilled city firmly yet?\nNo Caesar there, to be the soldiers friend!\nFull oft has he that orphaned city wept.\n\nBRUTUS.\nHa! thou of three-and-twenty wounds! Avaunt!\nThou unblest shade, what calls thee back to light?\nDown with thee, down, to Pluto's deepest haunt,\nAnd shroud thy form in black, eternal night,\nProud mourner! triumph not to learn our fall!\nPhillippi's altars reek with freedom's blood?\nThe bier of Brutus is Rome's funeral pall;\nHe Minos seeks. Hence to thy Stygian flood!\n\nCAESAR.\nThat death-stroke, Brutus, which thy weapon hurled!\nThou, too, Brutus?--that thou shouldst be my foe!\nOh, son! It was thy father! Son! The world\nWas thine by heritage! Now proudly go,\nWell mayst thou claim to be the chief in glory,\n'Twas thy fell sword that pierced thy father's heart!\nNow go--and at yon gates relate thy story--\nSay Brutus claims to be the chief in glory,\n'Twas his fell sword that pierced his father's heart!\nGo--Now thou'rt told what staid me on this shore,\nGrim ferryman, push off, and swiftly ply thine oar.\n\nBRUTUS.\nStay, father, stay! Within the whole bright round\nOf Sol's diurnal course I knew but one\nWho to compare with Caesar could be found;\nAnd that one, Caesar, thou didst call thy son!\n'Twas only Caesar could destroy a Rome;\nBrutus alone that Caesar could withstand--\nWhere Brutus lives, must Caesar die! Thy home\nBe far from mine. I'll seek another land.\n\n        [He lays down his guitar, and walks to and\n        fro in deep meditation.]\n\nWho will give me certainty! All is so dark--a confused labyrinth--no\noutlet--no guiding star. Were but all to end with this last gasp of\nbreath. To end, like an empty puppet-show. But why then this burning\nthirst after happiness? Wherefore this ideal of unattained perfection?\nThis looking to an hereafter for the fulfilment of our hopes? If the\npaltry pressure of this paltry thing (putting a pistol to his head)\nmakes the wise man and the fool--the coward and the brave--the noble and\nthe villain equal?--the harmony which pervades the inanimate world is so\ndivinely perfect--why, then, should there be such discord in the\nintellectual? No! no! there must be something beyond, for I have not\nyet attained to happiness.\n\nThink ye that I will tremble, spirits of my slaughtered victims? No,\nI will not tremble. (Trembling violently.) The shrieks of your dying\nagonies--your black, convulsive features--your ghastly bleeding wounds--\nwhat are they all but links of one indissoluble chain of destiny, which\nhung upon the temperament of my father, the life's blood of my mother,\nthe humors of my nurses and tutors, and even upon the holiday pastimes\nof my childhood! (Shaking with horror.) Why has my Perillus made of me\na brazen bull, whose burning entrails yearn after human flesh? (He\nlifts the pistol again to his head.)\n\nTime and Eternity!--linked together by a single instant! Fearful key,\nwhich locks behind me the prisonhouse of life, and opens before me the\nhabitations of eternal night--tell me--oh, tell me--whither--whither\nwilt thou lead me? Strange, unexplored land! Humanity is unnerved at\nthe fearful thought, the elasticity of our finite nature is paralyzed,\nand fancy, that wanton ape of the senses, juggles our credulity with\nappalling phantoms. No! no! a man must be firm. Be what thou wilt,\nthou undefined futurity, so I remain but true to myself. Be what thou\nwilt, so I but take this inward self hence with me. External forms are\nbut the trappings of the man. My heaven and my hell is within.\n\nWhat if Thou shouldst doom me to be sole inhabitant of some burnt-out\nworld which thou hast banished from thy sight, where darkness and\nnever-ending desolation were all my prospect; then would my creative\nbrain people the silent waste with its own images, and I should have\neternity for leisure to unravel the complicated picture of universal\nwretchedness. Or wilt thou make me pass through ever-repeated births\nand ever-changing scenes of misery, stage by stage*--to annihilation?\n\n   [This and other passages will remind the reader of Cato's soliloquy\n   \"It must be so, Plato; thou reasonest well.\" But the whole bears a\n   strong resemblance to Hamlet's \"To be or not to be;\" and some\n   passages in Measure for Measure, Act iii, Sc. 1.]\n\nCan I not burst asunder the life-threads woven for me in another world\nas easily as I do these? Thou mayest reduce me into nothing; but Thou\ncanst not take from me this power. (He loads the pistol, and then\nsuddenly pauses.) And shall I then rush into death from a coward fear\nof the ills of life? Shall I yield to misery the palm of victory over\nmyself? No! I will endure it! (He flings the pistol away.) Misery\nshall blunt its edge against my pride! Be my destiny fulfilled! (It\ngrows darker and darker.)\n\nHERMANN (coming through the forest). Hark! hark! the owl screeches\nhorribly--the village clock strikes twelve. Well, well--villainy is\nasleep--no listeners in these wilds. (He goes to the castle and\nknocks.) Come forth, thou man of sorrow! tenant of the miserable\ndungeon! thy meal awaits thee.\n\nCHARLES (stepping gently back, unperceived). What means this?\n\nVOICE (from within the castle). Who knocks? Is it you, Hermann, my\nraven?\n\nHERMANN. Yes, 'tis Hermann, your raven. Come to the grating and eat.\n(Owls are screeching.) Your night companions make a horrid noise, old\nman! Do you relish your repast?\n\nVOICE. Yes--I was very hungry. Thanks to thee, thou merciful sender of\nravens, for this thy bread in the wilderness! And how is my dear child,\nHermann?\n\nHERMANN. Hush!--hark!--A noise like snoring! Don't you hear something?\n\nVOICE. What? Do you hear anything?\n\nHERMANN. 'Tis the whistling of the wind through the crannies of the\ntower--a serenading which makes one's teeth chatter, and one's nails\nturn blue. Hark! tis there again. I still fancy I hear snoring. You\nhave company, old man. Ugh! ugh! ugh!\n\nVOICE. Do you see anything?\n\nHERMANN. Farewell! farewell! this is a fearful place. Go down into\nyour bole,--thy deliverer, thy avenger is above. Oh! accursed son! (Is\nabout to fly.)\n\nCHARLES (stepping forth with horror). Stand!\n\nHERMANN (screaming). Oh, me!*\n\n   *[In the acting edition Hermann, instead of this, says,--\n   'Tis one of his spies for certain, I have lost all fear (draws his\n   sword). Villain, defend yourself! You have a man before you.]\n\n   MOOR. I'll have an answer (strikes the sword out of his hand).\n   What boots this childish sword-play? Didst thou not speak of\n   vengeance? Vengeance belongs especially to me--of all men on\n   earth. Who dares interfere with my vocation?\n\n   HERMANN (starts back in affright). By heaven! That man was not\n   born of woman. His touch withers like the stroke of death.\n\n   VOICE. Alas, Hermann! to whom are you speaking?\n\n   MOOR. What! still those sounds? What is going on there? (Runs\n   towards the tower.) Some horrible mystery, no doubt, lies concealed\n   in that tower. This sword shall bring it to light.\n\n   HERMANN (comes forward trembling). Terrible stranger! art thou\n   the demon of this fearful desert--or perhaps 'one of the ministers\n   of that unfathonable retribution who make their circuit in this\n   lower world, and take account of all the deeds of darkness? Oh!\n   if thou art, be welcome to this tower of horrors!\n\n   MOOR. Well guessed, wanderer of the night! You have divined my\n   function. Exterminating Angel is my name; but I am flesh and blood\n   like thee. Is this some miserable wretch, cast out of men, and\n   buried in this dungeon? I will loosen his chains. Once more,\n   speak! thou voice of terror Where is the door?\n\n   HERMANN. As soon could Satan force the gates of heaven as thou\n   that door. Retire, thou man of might! The genius of the wicked is\n   beyond the ordinary powers of man.\n\n   MOOR. But not the craft of robbers. (He takes some pass-keys from\n   his pocket.) For once I thank heaven I've learned that craft!\n   These keys would mock hell's foresight. (He takes a key, and opens\n   the gate of the tower. An old man comes from below emaciated like\n   a skeleton. MOOR springs back with of right.) Horrible spectre!\n   my father!\n\nCHARLES. Stand! I say.\n\nHERMANN. Woe! woe! woe! now all is discovered!\n\nCHARLES. Speak! Who art thou? What brought thee here? Speak!\n\nHERMANN. Mercy, mercy! gracious sir! Hear but one word before you\nkill me.\n\nCHARLES (drawing his sword). What am I to hear?\n\nHERMANN. 'Tis true, he forbade me at the peril of my life--but I could\nnot help it--I dare not do otherwise--a God in heaven--your own\nvenerable father there--pity for him overcame me. Kill me, if you will!\n\nCHARLES. There's some mystery here--Out with it! Speak! I must know\nall.\n\nVOICE (from the castle). Woe! woe! Is it you, Hermann, that are\nspeaking? To whom are you speaking, Hermann?\n\nCHARLES. Some one else down there? What is the meaning of all this?\n(Runs towards the castle.) It is some prisoner whom mankind have cast\noff! I will loosen his chains. Voice! Speak! Where is the door?\n\nHERMANN. Oh, have mercy, sir--seek no further, I entreat--for mercy's\nsake desist! (He stops his way.)\n\nCHARLES. Locks, bolts, and bars, away! It must come out. Now, for the\nfirst time, come to my aid, thief-craft! (He opens the grated iron door\nwith, housebreaking tools. An OLD MAN, reduced to a skeleton, comes up\nfrom below.)\n\nTHE OLD MAN. Mercy on a poor wretch! Mercy!\n\nCHARLES (starts back in terror). That is my father's voice!\n\nOLD MOOR. I thank thee, merciful Heaven! The hour of deliverance has\narrived.\n\nCHARLES. Shade of the aged Moor! what has disturbed thee in thy grave?\nHas thy soul left this earth charged with some foul crime that bars the\ngates of Paradise against thee? Say?--I will have masses read, to send\nthy wandering spirit to its home. Hast thou buried in the earth the\ngold of widows and orphans, that thou art driven to wander howling\nthrough the midnight hour? I will snatch the hidden treasure from the\nclutches of the infernal dragon, though he should vomit a thousand\nredhot flames upon me, and gnash his sharp teeth against my sword. Or\ncomest thou, at my request, to reveal to me the mysteries of eternity?\nSpeak, thou! speak! I am not the man to blanch with fear!\n\nOLD MOOR. I am not a spirit. Touch me--I live but oh! a life indeed of\nmisery!\n\nCHARLES. What! hast thou not been buried?\n\nOLD MOOR. I was buried--that is to say, a dead dog lies in the vault of\nmy ancestors, and I have been pining for three long moons in this dark\nand loathsome dungeon, where no sunbeam shines, no warm breeze\npenetrates, where no friend is seen, where the hoarse raven croaks and\nowls screech their midnight concert.\n\nCHARLES. Heaven and earth! Who has done this?\n\nOLD MOOR. Curse him not! 'Tis my son, Francis, who did this.\n\nCHARLES. Francis? Francis? Oh, eternal chaos!\n\nOLD MOOR. If thou art a man, and hast a human heart--oh! my unknown\ndeliverer--then listen to a father's miseries which his own sons have\nheaped upon him. For three long moons I have moaned my pitiful tale to\nthese flinty walls--but all my answer was an empty echo, that seemed to\nmock my wailings. Therefore, if thou art a man, and hast a human\nheart--\n\nCHARLES. That appeal might move even wild beasts to pity.\n\nOLD MOOR. I lay upon a sick bed, and had scarcely begun to recover a\nlittle strength, after a dangerous illness, when a man was brought to\nme, who pretended that my first-born had fallen in battle. He brought a\nsword stained with his blood, and his last farewell--and said that my\ncurse had driven him into battle, and death, and despair.\n\nCHARLES (turning away in violent agitation). The light breaks in upon\nme!\n\nOLD MOOR. Hear me on! I fainted at the dreadful news. They must have\nthought me dead; for, when I recovered my senses, I was already in my\ncoffin, shrouded like a corpse. I scratched against the lid. It was\nopened--'twas in the dead of night--my son Francis stood before me--\n\"What!\" said he, with a tremendous voice, \"wilt thou then live forever?\"\n--and with this he slammed-to the lid of the coffin. The thunder of\nthese words bereft me of my senses; when I awoke again, I felt that the\ncoffin was in motion, and being borne on wheels. At last it was opened\n--I found myself at the entrance of this dungeon--my son stood before\nme, and the man, too, who had brought me the bloody sword from Charles.\nI fell at my son's feet, and ten times I embraced his knees, and wept,\nand conjured, and supplicated, but the supplications of a father reached\nnot his flinty heart. \"Down with the old carcass!\" said he, with a\nvoice of thunder, \"he has lived too long;\"--and I was thrust down\nwithout mercy, and my son Francis closed the door upon Me.\n\nCHARLES. Impossible!--impossible! Your memory or senses deceive you.\n\nOLD MOOR. Oh, that it were so! But hear me on, and restrain your rage!\nThere I lay for twenty hours, and not a soul cared for my misery. No\nhuman footstep treads this solitary wild, for 'tis commonly believed\nthat the ghosts of my ancestors drag clanking chains through these\nruins, and chant their funeral dirge at the hour of midnight. At last\nI heard the door creak again on its hinges; this man opened it, and\nbrought me bread and water. He told me that I had been condemned to die\nof hunger, and that his life was in danger should it be discovered that\nhe fed me. Thus has my miserable existence been till now sustained--but\nthe unceasing cold--the foul air of my filthy dungeon--my incurable\ngrief--have exhausted my strength, and reduced my body to a skeleton. A\nthousand times have I implored heaven, with tears, to put an end to my\nsufferings--but doubtless the measure of my punishment is not\nfulfilled,--or some happiness must be yet in store for me, for which he\ndeigns thus miraculously to preserve me. But I suffer justly--my\nCharles! my Charles!--and before there was even a gray hair on his Head!\n\nCHARLES. Enough! Rise! ye stocks, ye lumps of ice! ye lazy unfeeling\nsleepers! Up! will none of you awake? (He fires a pistol over their\nheads.)\n\nTHE ROBBERS (starting up). Ho! hallo! hallo! what is the matter?\n\nCHARLES. Has not that tale shaken you out of your sleep? 'Tis enough\nto break the sleep eternal! See here, see here! The laws of the world\nhave become mere dice-play; the bonds of nature are burst asunder; the\nDemon of Discord has broken loose, and stalks abroad triumphant! the Son\nhas slain his Father!\n\nTHE ROBBERS. What does the captain say?\n\nCHARLES. Slain! did I say? No, that is too mild a term! A son has\na thousand-fold broken his own father on the wheel,--impaled, racked,\nflayed him alive!--but all these words are too feeble to express what\nwould make sin itself blush and cannibals shudder. For ages, no devil\never conceived a deed so horrible. His own father!--but see, see him!\nhe has fainted away! His own father--the son--into this dungeon--cold--\nnaked--hungry--athirst--Oh! see, I pray you, see!--'tis my own father,\nin very truth it is.\n\nTHE ROBBERS (come running and surround the old man). Your father?\nYours?\n\nSCHWEITZER (approaches him reverently, and falls on his knees before\nhim). Father of my captain! let me kiss thy feet! My dagger is at thy\ncommand.\n\nCHARLES. Revenge, revenge, revenge! thou horribly injured, profaned\nold man! Thus, from this moment, and forever, I rend in twain all ties\nof fraternity. (He rends his garment from top to bottom.) Here, in the\nface of heaven, I curse him--curse every drop of blood which flows in\nhis veins! Hear me, O moon and stars! and thou black canopy of night,\nthat lookest down upon this horror! Hear me, thrice terrible avenger.\nThou who reignest above yon pallid orb, who sittest an avenger and a\njudge above the stars, and dartest thy fiery bolts through darkness on\nthe head of guilt! Behold me on my knees behold me raise this hand\naloft in the gloom of night--and hear my oath--and may nature vomit me\nforth as some horrible abortion from out the circle of her works if I\nbreak that oath! Here I swear that I will never more greet the light of\nday, till the blood of that foul parricide, spilt upon this stone, reeks\nin misty vapor towards heaven. (He rises.)\n\nROBBERS. 'Tis a deed of hell! After this, who shall call us villains?\nNo! by all the dragons of darkness we never have done anything half so\nhorrible.\n\nCHARLES. True! and by all the fearful groans of those whom your daggers\nhave despatched--of those who on that terrible day were consumed by\nfire, or crushed by the falling tower--no thought of murder or rapine\nshall be harbored in your breast, till every man among you has dyed his\ngarments scarlet in this monster's blood. It never, I should think,\nentered your dreams, that it would fall to your lot to execute the\ngreat decrees of heaven? The tangled web of our destiny is unravelled!\nTo-day, to-day, an invisible power has ennobled our craft! Worship Him\nwho has called you to this high destiny, who has conducted you hither,\nand deemed ye worthy to be the terrible angels of his inscrutable\njudgments! Uncover your heads! Bow down and kiss the dust, and rise up\nsanctified. (They kneel.)\n\nSCHWEITZER. Now, captain, issue your commands! What shall we do?\n\nCHARLES. Rise, Schweitzer! and touch these sacred locks! (Leading him\nto his father, and putting a lock of hair in his hand.) Do you remember\nstill, how you, cleft the skull of that Bohemian trooper, at the moment\nhis sabre was descending on my head, and I had sunk down on my knees,\nbreathless and exhausted? 'Twas then I promised thee a reward that\nshould be right royal. But to this hour I have never been able to\ndischarge that debt.\n\nSCHWEITZER. You swore that much to me, 'tis true; but let me call you\nmy debtor forever!\n\nCHARLES. No; now will I repay thee, Schweitzer! No mortal has yet been\nhonored as thou shalt be. I appoint thee avenger of my father's wrongs!\n(SCHWEITZER rises.)\n\nSCHWEITZER. Mighty captain! this day you have, for the first time, made\nme truly proud! Say, when, where, how shall I smite him?\n\nCHARLES. The minutes are sacred. You must hasten to the work. Choose\nthe best of the band, and lead them straight to the count's castle!\nDrag him from his bed, though he sleep, or he folded in the arms of\npleasure! Drag him from the table, though he be drunk! Tear him from\nthe crucifix, though he lie on his knees before it! But mark my words--\nI charge thee, deliver him into my hands alive! I will hew that man to\npieces, and feed the hungry vultures with his flesh, who dares but graze\nhis skin, or injure a single hair of his head! I must have him whole.\nBring him to me whole and alive, and a million shall be thy reward.\nI'll plunder kings at the risk of my life, but thou shalt have it, and\ngo free as air. Thou hast my purpose--see it done!\n\nSCHWEITZER. Enough, captain! here is my hand upon it. You shall see\nboth of us, or neither. Come, Schweitzer's destroying angels, follow\nme! (Exit with a troop.)\n\nCHARLES. The rest of you disperse in the forest--I remain here.\n\n\n\n\n                 ACT V.\n\n        SCENE I. A vista of rooms. Dark night.\n\n        Enter DANIEL, with a lantern and a bundle.\n\nDANIEL. Farewell, dear home! How many happy days have I enjoyed within\nthese walls, while my old master lived. Tears to thy memory, thou whom\nthe grave has long since devoured! He deserves this tribute from an old\nservant. His roof was the asylum of orphans, the refuge of the\ndestitute, but this son has made it a den of murderers. Farewell, thou\ndear floor! How often has old Daniel scrubbed thee! Farewell, dear\nstove, old Daniel takes a heavy leave of thee. All things had grown so\nfamiliar to thee,--thou wilt feel it sorely, old Eleazar. But heaven\npreserve me through grace from the wiles and assault of the tempter.\nEmpty I came hither--empty I will depart,--but my soul is saved! (He is\nin the act of going out, when he is met by FRANCIS, rushing in, in his\ndressing-gown.) Heaven help me! Master! (He puts out his lantern.)\n\nFRANCIS. Betrayed! betrayed! The spirit of the dead are vomited from\ntheir graves. The realm of death, shaken out of its eternal slumber,\nroars at me, \"Murderer, murderer!\" Who moves there?\n\nDANIEL (frightened). Help, holy Virgin! help! Is it you, my gracious\nmaster, whose shrieks echo so terribly through the castle that every one\nis aroused out of his sleep?\n\nFRANCIS. Sleep? And who gave thee leave to sleep? Go, get lights!\n(Exit DANIEL. Enter another servant.) No one shall sleep at this hour.\nDo you hear? All shall be awake--in arms--let the guns be loaded! Did\nyou not see them rushing through yon vaulted passages?\n\nSERVANT. See whom, my lord?\n\nFRANCIS. Whom? you dolt, slave! And do you, with a cold and vacant\nstare, ask me whom? Have they not beset me almost to madness? Whom?\nblockhead! whom? Ghosts and demons! How far is the night advanced?\n\nSERVANT. The watch has just called two.\n\nFRANCIS. What? will this eternal night last till doomsday? Did you\nhear no tumult near? no shout of victory? no trampling of horses?\nWhere is Char--the Count, I would say?\n\nSERVANT. I know not, my lord.\n\nFRANCIS. You know not? And are you too one of his gang? I'll tread\nyour villain's heart out through your ribs for that infernal \"I know\nnot!\" Begone, fetch the minister!\n\nSERVANT. My lord!\n\nFRANCIS. What! Do you grumble? Do you demur? (Exit servant hastily.)\nDo my very slaves conspire against me? Heaven, earth, and hell--all\nconspire against me!\n\nDANIEL (returns with a lighted candle). My lord!\n\nFRANCIS. Who said I trembled? No!--'twas but a dream. The dead still\nrest in their graves! Tremble! or pale? No, no! I am calm--quite\ntranquil.\n\nDANIEL. You are as pale as death, my lord; your voice is weak and\nfaltering.\n\nFRANCIS. I am somewhat feverish. When the minister comes be sure you\nsay I am in a fever. Say that I intend to be bled in the morning.\n\nDANIEL. Shall I give you some drops of the balsam of life on sugar?\n\nFRANCIS. Yes, balsam of life on sugar! The minister will not be here\njust yet. My voice is weak and faltering. Give me of the balsam of\nlife on sugar!\n\nDANIEL. Let me have the keys, I will go down to the closet and get it.\n\nFRANCIS. No! no! no! Stay!--or I will go with you. You see I must not\nbe left alone! How easily I might, you see--faint--if I should be left\nalone. Never mind, never mind! It will pass off--you must not leave\nme.\n\nDANIEL. Indeed, Sir, you are ill, very ill.\n\nFRANCIS. Yes, just so, just so, nothing more. And illness, you know,\nbewilders the brain, and breeds strange and maddening dreams. What\nsignify dreams? Dreams come from the stomach and cannot signify\nanything. Is it not so, Daniel? I had a very comical dream just now.\n(He sinks down fainting.)\n\nDANIEL. Oh, merciful heaven! what is this? George!--Conrad!\nSebastian! Martin! Give but some sign of life! (Shaking him.) Oh, the\nBlessed Virgin! Oh, Joseph! Keep but your reason! They will say I\nhave murdered him! Lord have mercy upon me!\n\nFRANCIS (confused). Avaunt!--avaunt!--why dost thou glare upon me thus,\nthou horrible spectre? The time for the resurrection of the dead is not\nyet come.\n\nDANIEL. Merciful heavens! he has lost his senses.\n\nFRANCIS (recovering himself gradually). Where am I? You here, Daniel?\nWhat have I said? Heed it not. I have told a lie, whatever I said.\nCome, help me up! 'T was only a fit of delirium--because--because--I\nhave not finished my night's rest.\n\nDANIEL. If John were but here! I'll call for help--I'll send for the\nphysician.\n\nFRANCIS. Stay! Seat yourself by my side on this sofa! There. You are\na sensible man, a good man. Listen to my dream!\n\nDANIEL. Not now; another time! Let me lead you to bed; you have great\nneed of rest.\n\nFRANCIS. No, no; I prythee, listen, Daniel, and have a good laugh at\nme. You must know I fancied that I held a princely banquet, my heart\nwas merry, and I lay stretched on the turf in the castle garden; and all\non a sudden--it was at midday--and all on a sudden--but mind you have a\ngood laugh at me!\n\nDANIEL. All on a sudden.\n\nFRANCIS. All on a sudden a tremendous peal of thunder struck upon my\nslumbering ear; I started up staggering and trembling; and lo, it seemed\nas if the whole hemisphere had burst forth in one flaming sheet of fire,\nand mountains, and cities, and forests melted away like wax in the\nfurnace; and then rose a howling whirlwind, which swept before it the\nearth, and the sea, and heaven; then came a sound, as from brazen\ntrumpets, \"Earth, give up thy dead: sea, give up thy dead!\" and the open\nplains began to heave, and to cast up skulls, and ribs, and jawbones,\nand legs, which drew together into human bodies, and then came sweeping\nalong in dense, interminable masses--a living deluge. Then I looked up,\nand lo! I stood at the foot of the thundering Sinai, and above me was a\nmultitude, and below me a multitude; and on the summit of the mountain,\non three smoking thrones, sat three men, before whose gaze all creation\ntrembled.\n\nDANIEL. Why, this is a living picture of the day of judgment.\n\nFRANCIS. Did I not tell you? Is it not ridiculous stuff? And one\nstepped forth who, to look upon, was like a starlight night; he had in\nhis hand a signet ring of iron, which he held up between the east and\nthe west, and said, \"Eternal, holy, just, immutable! There is but one\ntruth; there is but one virtue! Woe, woe, woe! to the doubting sinner!\"\nThen stepped forth a second, who had in his hand a flashing mirror,\nwhich he held up between the east and west, and said, \"This is the\nmirror of truth; hypocrisy and deceit cannot look on it.\" Then was I\nterrified, and so were all, for we saw the forms of snakes, and tigers,\nand leopards reflected from that fearful mirror. Then stepped forth a\nthird, who had in his hand a brazen balance, which he held up between\nthe east and the west, and said, \"Approach, ye sons of Adam! I weigh\nyour thoughts in the balance of my wrath! and your deeds with the weight\nof my fury!\"\n\nDANIEL. The Lord have mercy upon me!\n\nFRANCIS. They all stood pale and trembling, and every heart was panting\nwith fearful expectation. Then it seemed to me as if I heard my name\ncalled the first from out the thunders of the mountain, and the\ninnermost marrow froze within my bones, and my teeth chattered loudly.\nPresently the clang of the balance was heard, the rocks sent forth\nthunders, and the hours glided by, one after the other, towards the left\nscale, and each threw into it a mortal sin!\n\nDANIEL. Oh, may God forgive you!\n\nFRANCIS. He forgave me not! The left scale grew mountains high, but the\nother, filled with the blood of atonement, still outweighed it. At last\ncame an old man, heavily bowed down with grief, his arm gnawed through\nwith raging hunger. Every eye turned away in horror from the sight. I\nknew the man--he cut off a lock of his silver hair, and cast it into the\nscale of my sins, when to! in an instant, it sank down to the abyss, and\nthe scale of atonement flew up on high. Then heard I a voice, issuing\nlike thunder from the bowels *[Some editions of the original read Rauch\n(smoke), some Bauch, as translated.] of the mountain, \"Pardon, pardon to\nevery sinner of the earth and of the deep! Thou alone art rejected!\"\n(A profound pause.) Well, why don't you laugh?\n\nDANIEL. Can I laugh while my flesh creeps? Dreams come from above.\n\nFRANCIS. Pshaw! pshaw! Say not so! Call me a fool, an idiot, an\nabsurd fool! Do, there's a good Daniel, I entreat of you; have a hearty\nlaugh at me!\n\nDANIEL. Dreams come from God. I will pray for you.\n\nFRANCIS. Thou liest, I tell thee. Go, this instant, run! be quick!\nsee where the minister tarries all this time; tell him to come quickly,\ninstantly! But, I tell thee, thou liest!\n\nDANIEL. Heaven have mercy upon you!\n                             [Exit.]\n\nFRANCIS. Vulgar prejudice! mere superstition! It has not yet been\nproved that the past is not past and forgotten, or that there is an eye\nabove this earth to take account of what passes on it. Humph! Humph!\nBut whence, then, this fearful whisper to my soul? Is there really an\navenging judge above the stars? No, no! Yes, yes! A fearful monitor\nwithin bears witness that there is One above the stars who judgeth!\nWhat! meet the avenger above the stars this very night? No, no! I say.\nAll is empty, lonely, desolate, beyond the stars. Miserable subterfuge,\nbeneath which thy cowardice seeks to hide itself. And if there should\nbe something in it after all? No! no! it cannot be. I insist that it\ncannot be! But yet, if there should be! Woe to thee if thy sins should\nall have been registered above!--if they should be counted over to thee\nthis very night! Why creeps this shudder through my frame? To die!\nWhy does that word frighten me thus? To give an account to the Avenger,\nthere, above the stars! and if he should be just--the wails of orphans\nand widows, of the oppressed, the tormented, ascending to his ears, and\nhe be just? Why have they been afflicted? And why have I been\npermitted to trample upon them?\n\n              Enter PASTOR MOSER.\n\nMOSER. Your lordship sent for me! I am surprised! The first time in\nmy life! Is it to scoff at religion, or does it begin to make you\ntremble?\n\nFRANCIS. I may scoff or I may tremble, according as you shall answer\nme. Listen to me, Moser, I will prove that you are a fool, or wish to\nmake fools of others, and you shall answer me. Do you hear? At the\nperil of your life you shall answer me.\n\nMOSER. 'Tis a higher Being whom you summon before your tribunal. He\nwill answer you hereafter.\n\nFRANCIS. I will be answered now, this instant, that I may not commit\nthe contemptible folly of calling upon the idol of the vulgar under the\npressure of suffering. I have often, in bumpers of Burgundy, tauntingly\npledged you in the toast, \"There is no God!\" Now I address myself to\nyou in earnest, and I tell you there is none? You shall oppose me with\nall the weapons in your power; but with the breath of my lips I will\nblow them away.\n\nMOSER. 'Twere well that you could also blow away the thunder which will\nalight upon your proud soul with ten thousand times ten thousand tons'\nweight! That omniscient God, whom you--fool and miscreant--are denying\nin the midst of his creation, needeth not to justify himself by the\nmouth of dust. He is as great in your tyrannies as in the sweetest\nsmile of triumphant virtue.\n\nFRANCIS. Uncommonly well said, parson. Thus I like you.\n\nMOSER. I stand here as steward of a greater Master, and am addressing\none who, like myself, is a sinner--one whom I care not to please. I\nmust indeed be able to work miracles, to extort the acknowledgment from\nyour obdurate wickedness--but if your conviction is so firm, why have\nyou sent for me in the middle of the night?\n\nFRANCIS. Because time hangs heavy on my hands, and the chess-board has\nceased to have any attraction. I wish to amuse myself in a tilt with\nthe parson. Your empty terrors will not unman my courage. I am well\naware that those who have come off short in this world look forward to\neternity; but they will be sadly disappointed. I have always read that\nour whole body is nothing more than a blood-spring, and that, with its\nlast drop, mind and thought dissolve into nothing. They share all the\ninfirmities of the body; why, then, should they not cease with its\ndissolution? Why not evaporate in its decomposition? Let a drop of\nwater stray into your brain, and life makes a sudden pause, which\nborders on non-existence, and this pause continued is death. Sensation\nis the vibration of a few chords, which, when the instrument is broken,\ncease to sound. If I raze my seven castles--if I dash this Venus to\npieces--there is an end of their symmetry and beauty. Behold! thus is\nit with your immortal soul!\n\nMOSER. So says the philosophy of your despair. But your own heart,\nwhich knocks against your ribs with terror even while you thus argue,\ngives your tongue the lie. These cobwebs of systems are swept away by\nthe single word--\"Thou must die!\" I challenge you, and be this the\ntest: If you maintain your firmness in the hour of death; if your\nprinciples do not then miserably desert you, you shall be admitted to\nhave the best of the argument. But if, in that dread hour, the least\nshudder creeps over you, then woe be to you! you have deceived yourself.\n\nFRANCIS (disturbed). If in the hour of death a shudder creeps over me?\n\nMOSER. I have seen many such wretches before now, who set truth at\ndefiance up to that point; but at the approach of death the illusion\nvanished. I will stand at your bedside when you are dying--I should\nmuch like to see a tyrant die. I will stand by, and look you\nsteadfastly in the face when the physician takes your cold, clammy hand,\nand is scarcely able to detect your expiring pulse; and when he looks\nup, and, with a fearful shake of the head, says to you, \"All human aid\nis in vain!\" Beware, at that moment, beware, lest you look like Richard\nand Nero!\n\nFRANCIS. No! no!\n\nMOSER. Even that very \"No\" will then be turned to a howling \"Yea!\" An\ninward tribunal, which you can no longer cheat with sceptical delusions,\nwill then wake up and pass judgment upon you. But the waking up will be\nlike that of one buried alive in the bowels of the churchyard; there\nwill come remorse like that of the suicide who has committed the fatal\nact and repents it;--'twill be a flash of lightning suddenly breaking in\nupon the midnight darkness of your life! There will be one look, and,\nif you can sustain that, I will admit that you have won!\n\nFRANCIS (walking up and down restlessly). Cant! Priestly cant!\n\nMOSER. Then, for the first time, will the sword of eternity pass\nthrough your soul;--and then, for the first time, too late, the thought\nof God will wake up a terrible monitor, whose name is Judge. Mark this,\nMoor; a thousand lives hang upon your beck; and of those thousand every\nnine hundred and ninety-nine have been rendered miserable by you. You\nwanted but the Roman empire to be a Nero, the kingdom of Peru to be a\nPizarro. Now do you really think that the Almighty will suffer a worm\nlike you to play the tyrant in His world and to reverse all his\nordinances? Do you think the nine hundred and ninety-nine were created\nonly to be destroyed, only to serve as puppets in your diabolical game?\nThink it not! He will call you to account for every minute of which you\nhave robbed them, every joy that you have poisoned, every perfection\nthat you have intercepted. Then, if you can answer Him--then, Moor,\nI will admit that you have won.\n\nFRANCIS. No more, not another word! Am I to be at the mercy of thy\ndrivelling fancies?\n\nMOSER. Beware! The different destinies of mankind are balanced with\nterrible nicety. The scale of life which sinks here will rise there,\nand that which rises here will sink there. What was here temporary\naffliction will there be eternal triumph; and what here was temporary\ntriumph will there be eternal despair.\n\nFRANCIS (rushing savagely upon him.) May the thunder of heaven strike\nthee dumb, thou lying spirit! I will tear thy venomed tongue out of thy\nmouth!\n\nMOSER. Do you so soon feel the weight of truth? Before I have brought\nforward one single word of evidence? Let me first proceed to the\nproofs--\n\nFRANCIS. Silence! To hell with thee and thy proofs! The soul is\nannihilated, I tell thee, and I will not be gainsaid!\n\nMOSER. That is what the spirits of the bottomless pit are hourly\nmoaning for; but heaven denies the boon. Do you hope to escape from the\nAvenger's arm even in the solitary waste of nothingness? If you climb\nup into heaven, he is there! if you make your bed in hell, behold he is\nthere also! If you say to the night, \"Hide me!\" and to the darkness,\n\"Cover me!\" even the night shall be light about you, and darkness blaze\nupon your damned soul like a noonday sun.\n\nFRANCIS. But I do not wish to be immortal--let them be so that like;\nI have no desire to hinder them. I will force him to annihilate me;\nI will so provoke his fury that he may utterly destroy me. Tell me\nwhich are the greatest sins--which excite him to the most terrible\nwrath?\n\nMOSER. I know but two. But men do not commit these, nor do men even\ndream of them.\n\nFRANCIS. What are they?\n\nMOSER (very significantly). Parricide is the name of the one;\nfratricide of the other. Why do you turn so suddenly pale?\n\nFRANCIS. What, old man? Art thou in league with heaven or with hell?\nWho told thee that?\n\nMOSER. Woe to him that hath them both upon his soul! It were better\nfor that man that he had never been born! But be at peace; you have no\nlonger either a father or a brother!\n\nFRANCIS. Ha! what! Do you know no greater sin? Think again! Death,\nheaven, eternity, damnation, hang upon thy lips. Not one greater?\n\nMOSER. No, not one\n\nFRANCIS (falling back in a chair). Annihilation! annihilation!\n\nMOSER. Rejoice, then, rejoice! Congratulate yourself! With all your\nabominations you are yet a saint in comparison with a parricide. The\ncurse that falls upon you is a love ditty in comparison with the curse\nthat lies upon him. Retribution--\n\nFRANCIS (starting up). Away with thee! May the graves open and swallow\nthee ten thousand fathoms deep, thou bird of ill omen! Who bade thee\ncome here? Away, I tell thee, or I will run thee through and through!\n\nMOSER. Can mere \"priestly cant\" excite a philosopher to such a pitch of\nfrenzy? Why not blow it away with a breath of your lips?\n                             (Exit.)\n\n       [FRANCIS throws himself about in his chair in\n        terrible agitation. Profound stillness.]\n\n             Enter a SERVANT, hastily\n\nSERVANT. The Lady Amelia has fled. The count has suddenly disappeared.\n\n           Enter DANIEL, in great alarm.\n\nDANIEL. My lord, a troop of furious horsemen are galloping down the\nhill, shouting \"murder! murder!\" The whole village is in alarm.\n\nFRANCIS. Quick! let all the bells be tolled--summon everyone to the\nchapel--let all fall on their knees--pray for me. All prisoners shall\nbe released and forgiven--I will make two and threefold restitution to\nthe poor--I will--why don't you run? Do call in the father confessor,\nthat he may give me absolution for my sins. What! are you not gone yet?\n(The uproar becomes more audible.)\n\nDANIEL. Heaven have mercy upon me, poor sinner! Can I believe you\nin earnest, sir? You, who always made a jest of religion? How many\na Bible and prayer-book have you flung at my head when by chance you\ncaught me at my devotions?\n\nFRANCIS. No more of this. To die! think of it! to die! It will be too\nlate! (The voice of SCHWEITZER is heard, loud and furious.) Pray for\nme, Daniel! Pray, I entreat you!\n\nDANIEL. I always told you,--\"you hold prayer in such contempt; but take\nheed! take heed! when the fatal hour comes, when the waters are flowing\nin upon your soul, you will be ready to give all the treasures of the\nworld for one little Christian prayer.\" Do you see it now? What abuse\nyou used to heap on me! Now you feel it! Is it not so!\n\nFRANCIS (embracing him violently). Forgive me! my dear precious jewel\nof a Daniel, forgive me! I will clothe you from head to foot--do but\npray. I will make quite a bridegroom of you--I will--only do pray--\nI entreat you--on my knees, I conjure you. In the devil's name, pray!\nwhy don't you pray? (Tumult in the streets, shouts and noises.)\n\nSCHWEIT. (in the street). Storm the place! Kill all before you!\nForce the gates! I see lights! He must be there!\n\nFRANCIS (on his knees). Listen to my prayer, O God in heaven! It is\nthe first time--it shall never happen again. Hear me, God in heaven!\n\nDANIEL. Mercy on me! What are you saying? What a wicked prayer!\n\n          Uproar of the PEOPLE, rushing in.\n\nPEOPLE. Robbers! murderers! Who makes such a dreadful noise at this\nmidnight hour!\n\nSCHWEIT (still in the street). Beat them back, comrades! 'Tis the\ndevil, come to fetch your master. Where is Schwarz with his troop?\nSurround the castle, Grimm! Scale the walls!\n\nGRIMM. Bring the firebrands. Either we must up or he must down. I will\nthrow fire into his halls.\n\nFRANCIS (praying). Oh Lord! I have been no common murderer--I have\nbeen guilty of no petty crimes, gracious Lord--\n\nDANIEL. Heaven be merciful to us! His very prayers are turned to sins.\n(Stones and firebrands are hurled up from below; the windows fall in\nwith a crash; the castle takes fire.)\n\nFRANCIS. I cannot pray. Here! and here! (striking his breast and his\nforehead) All is so void--so barren! (Rises from his knees.) No, I will\nnot pray. Heaven shall not have that triumph, nor hell that pastime.\n\nDANIEL. O holy Virgin! Help! save! The whole castle is in flames!\n\nFRANCIS. There, take this sword! Quick! Run it right through my body,\nthat these fiends may not be in time to make holiday sport of me. (The\nfire increases.)\n\nDANIEL. Heaven forbid? Heaven forbid! I would send no one before his\ntime to heaven, much less to--(He runs away).\n\nFRANCIS (following him with a ghastly stare, after a pause).\nTo hell, thou wouldst say. Indeed! I scent something of the kind.\n(In delirium.) Are these their triumphant yells? Do I hear you\nhissing, ye serpents of the abyss? They force their way up--they\nbesiege the door! Why do I shrink from this biting steel? The door\ncracks--it yields--there is no escape! Ha! then do thou have mercy upon\nme! (He tears away the golden cord from his hat, and strangles\nhimself.)*\n\n   *[In the acting edition, Francis attempts to throw himself into the\n   flames, but is prevented by the robbers, and taken alive. He is\n   then brought before his brother, in chains, for sentence.\n   SCHWEITZER says, \"I have fulfilled my word, and brought him alive.\"\n   GRIMM. \"We tore him out of the flames and the castle is in ashes.\"\n   After confronting Francis with his father, and a reproachful\n   interview between the brothers, Charles delegates the judgment on\n   Francis to Schweitzer and Kosinsky, but for himself forgives him in\n   these words: \"Thou hast robbed me of heaven's bliss! Be that sin\n   blotted out! Thy doom is sealed--perdition is thy lot! But I\n   forgive thee, brother.\" Upon this CHARLES embraces and leaves him;\n   the ROBBERS however, thrust FRANCIS into the dungeon where he had\n   immured his father, laughing in a savage manner. Beyond this the\n   fate of Francis is left undetermined. Schweitzer, instead of\n   killing himself, is made partaker, with Kosinsky, of Moor's\n   estate.]\n\n           Enter SCHWEITZER and his band.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Murderous wretch, where art thou? Did you see how they\nfled? Has he so few friends? Where has the beast crawled to?\n\nGRIMM (stumbles over the corpse). Stay! what is this lying in the way?\nLights here.\n\nSCHWARZ. He has been beforehand with us. Put up your swords. There he\nlies sprawling like a dead dog.\n\nSCHWEITZER. Dead! What! dead? Dead without me? 'Tis a lie, I say.\nMark how quickly he will spring upon his feet! (Shakes him). Hollo!\nup with you? There is a father to be murdered.\n\nGRIMM. Spare your pains. He is as dead as a log.\n\nSCHWEITZER (steps aside from him). Yes, his game is up! He is dead!\ndead! Go back and tell my captain he is as dead as a log. He will not\nsee me again. (Blows his brains out.)\n\n\n\n\n SCENE II.--The scene the same as the last scene of the preceding Act.\n\n     OLD MOOR seated on a stone; CHARLES VON MOOR opposite;\n          ROBBERS scattered through the wood.\n\nCHARLES. He does not come! (Strikes his dagger against a stone till\nthe sparks fly.)\n\nOLD MOOR. Let pardon be his punishment--redoubled love my vengeance.\n\nCHARLES. No! by my enraged soul that shall not be! I will not permit\nit. He shall bear that enormous load of crime with him into eternity!--\nwhat else should I kill him for?\n\nOLD MOOR (bursting into tears). Oh my child!\n\nCHARLES. What! you weep for him? In sight of this dungeon?\n\nOLD MOOR. Mercy! oh mercy! (Wringing his hands violently.) Now--now my\nson is brought to judgment!\n\nCHARLES (starting). Which son?\n\nOLD MOOR. Ha! what means that question?\n\nCHARLES. Nothing! nothing!\n\nOLD MOOR. Art thou come to make a mockery of my grief?\n\nCHARLES. Treacherous conscience! Take no heed of my words!\n\nOLD MOOR. Yes, I persecuted a son, and a son persecutes me in return.\nIt is the finger of God. Oh my Charles! my Charles! If thou dost hover\naround me in the realms of peace, forgive me! oh forgive me!\n\nCHARLES (hastily). He forgives you! (Checking himself.) If he is\nworthy to be called your son, he must forgive you!\n\nOLD MOOR. Ha! he was too noble a son for me. But I will go to him with\nmy tears, my sleepless nights, my racking dreams. I will embrace his\nknees, and cry--cry aloud--\"I have sinned against heaven and before\nthee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy father!\"\n\nCHARLES (in deep emotion). Was he very dear to you--that other son?\n\nOLD MOOR. Heaven is my witness, how much I loved him. Oh, why did I\nsuffer myself to be beguiled by the arts of a wicked son? I was an\nenvied father among the fathers of the world--my children full of\npromise, blooming by my side! But--oh that fatal hour!--the demon of\nenvy entered into the heart of my younger son--I listened to the\nserpent--and--lost both my children! (Hides his countenance.)\n\nCHARLES (removes to a distance from him). Lost forever!\n\nOLD MOOR. Oh, deeply do I feel the words of Amelia. The spirit of\nvengeance spoke from her lips. \"In vain wilt thou stretch forth thy\ndying hands after a son, in vain fancy thou art grasping the warm hands\nof thy Charles,--he will never more stand by thy bedside.\"\n\n    (CHARLES stretches out his hand to him with averted face.)\n\nOh, that this were the hand of my Charles! But he is laid far away in\nthe narrow house--he is sleeping the iron sleep--he hears not the voice\nof my lamentation. Woe is me! to die in the arms of a stranger? No son\nleft--no son left to close my eyes!\n\nCHARLES (in violent emotion). It must be so--the moment has arrived.\nLeave me--(to the ROBBERS.) And yet--can I restore his son to him?\nAlas! No! I cannot restore him that son! No! I will not think of it.\n\nOLD MOOR. Friend! what is that you were muttering?\n\nCHARLES. Your son--yes, old man--(faltering) your son--is--lost\nforever!\n\nOLD MOOR. Forever?\n\nCHARLES (looking up to heaven in bitter anguish). Oh this once--keep my\nsoul from sinking--sustain me but this once!\n\nOLD MOOR. Forever, did you say.\n\nCHARLES. Ask no more! I said forever!\n\nOLD MOOR. Stranger, stranger! why didst thou drag me forth from the\ndungeon to remind me of my sorrows?\n\nCHARLES. And what if I were now to snatch his blessing?--snatch it like\na thief, and steal away with the precious prize? A father's blessing,\nthey say, is never lost.\n\nOLD MOOR. And is my Francis too lost?\n\nCHARLES (falling on his knees before him). 'Twas I who burst the bars\nof your dungeon. I crave thy blessing!\n\nOLD MOOR (sorrowfully). Oh that thou shouldst destroy the son!--thou,\nthe father's deliverer! Behold! Heaven's mercy is untiring, and we\npitiful worms let the sun go down upon our wrath. (Lays his hand upon\nthe head of CHARLES.) Be thou happy, even as thou shalt be merciful!\n\nCHARLES (rising much affected). Oh!--where is my manhood? My sinews\nare unstrung--the sword drops from my hand.\n\nOLD MOOR. How lovely a thing it is when brethren dwell together in\nunity; as the dewdrops of heaven that fall upon the mountains of Zion.\nLearn to deserve that happiness, young man, and the angels of heaven\nwill sun themselves in thy glory. Let thy wisdom be the wisdom of gray\nhairs, but let thy heart be the heart of innocent childhood.\n\nCHARLES. Oh, for a foretaste of that happiness! Kiss me, divine old\nman!\n\nOLD MOOR (kissing him). Think it thy father's kiss; and I will think I\nam kissing my son. Canst thou too weep?\n\nCHARLES. I felt as if it were my father's kiss! Woe unto me, were they\nto bring him now!\n\n   (The companions of SCHWEITZER enter in a silent and mournful\n   procession, hanging down their heads and hiding their faces.)\n\nCHARLES. Good heaven! (Retreats horror-struck, and seeks to hide\nhimself. They pass by him his face is averted. Profound silence. They\nhalt.)\n\nGRIMM (in a subdued tone). My captain!\n\n      [CHARLES does not answer and steps farther back.]\n\nSCHWARZ. Dear captain!\n\n          [CHARLES retreats still farther.]\n\nGRIMM. 'Tis not our fault, captain!\n\nCHARLES (without looking at them). Who are ye?\n\nGRIMM. You do not look at us! Your faithful followers.\n\nCHARLES. Woe to ye, if ye are faithful to me!\n\nGRIMM. The last farewell from your servant Schweitzer!--\n\nCHARLES (starting). Then ye have not found him?\n\nSCHWARZ. Found him dead.\n\nCHARLES (leaping up with joy). Thanks, O Sovereign Ruler of all things!\n--Embrace me, my children!--Mercy be henceforward our watchword!--Now,\nwere that too surmounted,--all would be surmounted.\n\n            Enter ROBBERS with AMELIA.\n\nROBBERS. Hurrah! hurrah! A prize, a splendid prize!\n\nAMELIA (with hair dishevelled). The dead, they cry, have arisen at his\nvoice--My uncle alive--in this wood--Where is he? Charles? Uncle!--Ha?\n(She rushes into the arms, of OLD MOOR.)\n\nOLD MOOR. Amelia! my daughter! Amelia! (Holds her tightly grasped in\nhis arms.)\n\nCHARLES (starting back). Who brings this image before my eyes.\n\nAMELIA (tearing herself away from the old man, rushes upon CHARLES, and\nembraces him in an ecstasy of delight). I have him, O ye stars! I have\nhim!\n\nCHARLES (tearing himself away, to the ROBBERS). Let us be gone,\ncomrades! The arch fiend has betrayed me!\n\nAMELIA. My bridegroom, my bridegroom! thou art raving! Ha! 'Tis with\ndelight! Why, then, am I so cold, so unfeeling, in the midst of this\ntumult of happiness?\n\nOLD MOOR (rousing himself). Bridegroom? Daughter! my daughter! Thy\nbridegroom?*\n\n   *[Instead of this the stage edition has, \"Come my children! Thy\n   hand, Charles--and thine, Amelia. Oh! I never looked for such\n   happiness on this side the grave. Here let me unite you forever.\"]\n\nAMELIA. His forever! He forever, ever, mine! Oh! ye heavenly powers!\nsupport me in this ecstasy of bliss, lest I sink beneath its weight!\n\nCHARLES. Tear her from my neck! Kill her! Kill him! Kill me--\nyourselves--everybody! Let the whole world perish! (About to rush of.)\n\nAMELIA. Whither? what? Love! eternity! happiness! never-ending joys!\nand thou wouldst fly?\n\nCHARLES. Away, away! most unfortunate of brides! See with thine own\neyes; ask, and hear it with thine own ears! Most miserable of fathers!\nLet me escape hence forever!\n\nAMELIA. Support me! for heaven's sake support me! It is growing dark\nbefore my eyes! He flies!\n\nCHARLES. Too late! In vain! Your curse, father! Ask me no more!\nI am--I have--your curse--your supposed curse! Who enticed me hither?\n(Rushing upon the ROBBERS with drawn sword.) Which of you enticed me\nhither, ye demons of the abyss? Perish, then, Amelia! Die, father!\nDie, for the third time, through me! These, thy deliverers, are Robbers\nand Murderers! Thy Charles is their Captain! (OLD MOOR expires.)\n\n     [AMELIA stands silent and transfixed like a statue.\n        The whole band are mute. A fearful pause.]\n\nCHARLES (rushing against an oak). The souls of those I have strangled\nin the intoxication of love--of those whom I crushed to atoms in the\nsacredness of sleep--of those whom--Ha! ha! ha! do you hear the\npowder-magazine bursting over the heads of women in travail? Do you see\nthe flames creeping round the cradles of sucklings? That is our nuptial\ntorch; those shrieks our wedding music! Oh! he forgetteth none of these\nthings!--he knoweth how to connect the--links in the chain of life.\nTherefore do love's delights elude my grasp; therefore is love given me\nfor a torment! This is retribution!\n\nAMELIA. 'Tis all true! Thou Ruler in heaven! 'Tis all true! What\nhave I done, poor innocent lamb? I have loved this man!\n\nCHARLES. This is more than a man can endure. Have I not heard death\nhissing at me from more thousands of barrels, and never yet moved a\nhair's breadth out of its way. And shall I now be taught to tremble\nlike a woman? tremble before a woman! No! a woman shall not conquer my\nmanly courage! Blood! blood! 'tis but a fit of womanish feeling. I\nmust glut myself with blood; and this will pass away. (He is about to\nfly.)\n\nAMELIA (sinking into his arms). Murderer! devil! I cannot--angel--\nleave thee!\n\nCHARLES (thrusting her from him). Away! insidious serpent! Thou\nwouldst make a mockery of my frenzy; but I will bid defiance to my\ntyrant destiny. What! art thou weeping? O ye relentless, malicious\nstars! She pretends to weep, as if any soul could weep for me!\n(AMELIA falls on his neck.) Ha! what means this? She shuns me not--she\nspurns me not. Amelia! hast thou then forgotten? Dost thou remember\nwhom thou art embracing, Amelia?\n\nAMELIA. My only one, mine, mine forever!\n\nCHARLES (recovering himself in an ecstasy of joy). She forgives me, she\nloves me! Then am I pure as the ether of heaven, for she loves me!\nWith tears I thank thee, all-merciful Father! (He falls on his knees,\nand bursts into a violent fit of weeping.) The peace of my soul is\nrestored; my sufferings are at an end. Hell is no more! Behold! oh\nbehold! the child of light weeps on the neck of a repentant demon!\n(Rising and turning to the ROBBERS). Why are ye not weeping also?\nWeep, weep, ye are all so happy. O Amelia! Amelia! Amelia! (He hangs\non her neck, they remain locked in a silent embrace.)\n\nA ROBBER (stepping forward enraged). Hold, traitor! This instant come\nfrom her arms! or I will speak a word that shall make thy ears tingle,\nand thy teeth chatter with horror! (He holds his sword between them.)\n\nAN AGED ROBBER. Remember the Bohemian forests! Dost thou hear? dost\nthou tremble? Remember the Bohemian forests, I tell thee! Faithless\nman! where are thy oaths? Are wounds so soon forgotten? Who staked\nfortune, honor, life itself for thee? Who stood by thee like walls, and\nlike shields caught the blows which were aimed at thy life? Didst not\nthou then lift up thy hand and swear an iron oath never to forsake us,\neven as we forsook not thee? Base, perfidious wretch! and wouldst thou\nnow desert us at the whining of a harlot?\n\nA THIRD ROBBER. Shame on thy perjury! The spirit of the immolated\nRoller, whom thou didst summon from the realms of death to attest thy\noath, will blush at thy cowardice, and rise from his grave full armed to\nchastise thee.\n\nTHE ROBBERS (all in disorder, tearing open their garments). See here!\nand here! Dost thou know these scars? Thou art ours! With our heart's\nblood we have bought thee, and thou art ours bodily, even though the\nArchangel Michael should seek to wrest thee out of the grasp of the\nfiery Moloch! Now! March with us! Sacrifice for sacrifice, Amelia for\nthe band!\n\nCHARLES (releasing her hand). It is past! I would arise and return to\nmy father; but heaven has said, \"It shall not be!\" (Coldly.) Blind fool\nthat I was! why should I wish it? Is it possible for a great sinner to\nreturn? A great sinner never can return. That ought I long since to\nhave known. Be still! I pray thee be still! 'Tis all as it should be.\nWhen He sought me I would not; now that I seek him, He will not. What\ncan be more just? Do not roll about thine eyes so wildly. He--has no\nneed of me. Has He not creatures in abundance? One he can easily\nspare, and that one am I. Come along, comrades!\n\nAMELIA (pulling him back). Stay, I beseech you! One blow! one deadly\nblow! Again forsaken! Draw thy sword, and have mercy upon me!\n\nCHARLES. Mercy has taken refuge among bears. I will not kill thee!\n\nAMELIA (embracing his knees). Oh, for heaven's sake! by all that is\nmerciful! I ask no longer for love. I know that our stars fly from\neach other in opposition. Death is all I ask. Forsaken, forsaken!\nTake that word in all its dreadful import! Forsaken! I cannot survive\nit! Thou knowest well that no woman can survive that. All I ask is\ndeath. See, my hand trembles! I have not courage to strike the blow.\nI shrink from the gleaming blade! To thee it is so easy, so very easy;\nthou art a master in murder--draw thy sword, and make me happy!\n\nCHARLES. Wouldst thou alone be happy? Away with thee! I will kill no\nwoman!\n\nAMELIA. Ha! destroyer! thou canst only kill the happy; they who are\nweary of existence thou sparest! (She glides towards the robbers.) Then\ndo ye have mercy on me, disciples of murder! There lurks a bloodthirsty\npity in your looks that is consoling to the wretched. Your master is a\nboaster and a coward.\n\nCHARLES. Woman, what dost thou say? (The ROBBERS turn away.)\n\nAMELIA. No friend? No; not even among these a friend? (She rises.)\nWell, then, let Dido teach me how to die! (She is going; a ROBBER takes\naim at her.)\n\nCHARLES. Hold! dare it! Moor's Amelia shall die by no other hand than\nMoor's. (He strikes her dead.)\n\nTHE ROBBERS. Captain! captain! what hast thou done? Art thou raving?\n\nCHARLES (with his eyes fixed on the body). One more pang and all will\nbe over. She is immolated! Now, look on! have you any farther demand?\nYe staked a life for me, a life which has ceased to be your own--a life\nfull of infamy and shame! I have sacrificed an angel for you. Now!\nlook upon her! Are you content?\n\nGRIMM. You have repaid your debt with usury. You have done all that man\ncould do for his honor, and more. Now let's away.\n\nCHARLES. What say you? Is not the life of a saint for the life of a\nfelon more than an equal exchange? Oh! I say unto you if every one of\nyou were to--mount the scaffold, and to have his flesh torn from his\nbones piecemeal with red-hot pincers, through eleven long summer days of\ntorture, yet would it not counterbalance these tears! (With a bitter\nlaugh.) The scars! the Bohemian forests! Yes, yes! they must be\nrepaid, of course!\n\nSCHWARZ. Compose yourself, captain! Come along with us! this is no\nsight for you. Lead us elsewhere!\n\nCHARLES. Stay! one word more before we proceed elsewhere. Mark me, ye\nmalicious executioners of my barbarous nod! from this moment I cease to\nbe your captain.*\n\n   *[The acting edition reads,--\"Banditti! we are quits. This\n   bleeding corpse cancels my bond to you forever. From your own I\n   set you free.\" ROBBERS. \"We are again your slaves till death!\"\n   CHARLES. \"No, no, no! We have done with each other. My genius\n   whispers me, 'Go no further, Moor. Here is the goal of humanity--\n   and thine!' Take back this bloody plume (throws it at their feet).\n   Let him who seeks to be your captain take it up.\"]\n\nWith shame and horror I here lay down the bloody staff, under which you\nthought yourselves licensed to perpetrate your crimes and to defile the\nfair light of heaven with deeds of darkness. Depart to the right and to\nthe left. We shall never more have aught in common.\n\nTHE ROBBERS. Ha! coward! where are thy lofty schemes? were they but\nsoap-bubbles, which disperse at the breath of a woman?*\n\n\n   *[In lieu of this soliloquy and what follows, to the end, the\n   acting edition has:--\n\n   R. MOOR. Dare not to scrutinize the acts of Moor. That is my last\n   command. Now, draw near--form a circle around me, and receive the\n   last words of your dying captain. (He surveys them attentively for\n   some time.) You have been devotedly faithful to me, faithful\n   beyond example. Had virtue bound you together as firmly as vice,\n   you would have been heroes, and your names recorded by mankind with\n   admiration. Go and offer your services to the state. Dedicate\n   your talents to the cause of a monarch who is waging war in\n   vindication of the rights of man. With this blessing I disband\n   you. Schweitzer and Kosinsky, do you stay. (The others disperse\n   slowly, with signs of emotion.)]\n\n\n\n                SCENE VIII.\n\n\n\n          R. MOOR, SCRWETTZER, and KOSINSKY.\n\n   R. MOOR. Give me thy right hand, Kosinsky--Schweitzer thy left.\n   (He takes their hands, and stands between, them; to KOSINSKY,)\n   Young man, thou art still pure-amongst the guilty thou alone art\n   guiltless! (To SCHWEITZER.) Deeply have I imbrued thy hand in\n   blood. 'Tis I who have done this. With this cordial grasp I take\n   back mine own. Schweitzer! thou art purified! (He raises their\n   hands fervently to heaven.) Father in heaven! here I restore them\n   to thee. They will be more devoted to thy service than those who\n   never fell. Of that I feel assured. (SCHWEITZER and KOSINSKY fall\n   on his neck with fervor.) Not now--not now, dear comrades. Spare\n   my feelings in this trying hour. An earldom has this day fallen to\n   my lot--a rich domain on which no malediction rests. Share it\n   between you, my children; become good citizens; and if for ten\n   human beings that I have destroyed you make but one happy, my soul\n   may yet be saved. Go--no farewell! In another world we may meet\n   again--or perhaps no more. Away! away! ere my fortitude desert me.\n               [Exeunt both, with downcast countenances.]\n\n\n                SCENE IX.\n\n   And I, too, am a good citizen. Do I not fulfil the extremity of\n   the law? Do I not honor the law? Do I not uphold and defend it?\n   I remember speaking to a poor officer on my way hither, who was\n   toiling as a day-laborer, and has eleven living children. A\n   thousand ducats have been offered to whoever shall deliver up the\n   great robber alive. That man shall be served. [Exit.]\n\n\nCHARLES. Oh! fool that I was, to fancy that I could amend the world by\nmisdeeds and maintain law by lawlessness! I called it vengeance and\nequity. I presumed, O Providence! upon whetting out the notches of thy\nsword and repairing thy partialities. But, oh, vain trifling! here I\nstand on the brink of a fearful life, and learn, with wailing and\ngnashing of teeth, that two men like myself could ruin the whole edifice\nof the moral world. Pardon--pardon the boy who thought to forestall\nThee; to Thee alone belongeth vengeance; Thou needest not the hand of\nman! But it is not in my power to recall the past; that which is ruined\nremains ruined; what I have thrown down will never more rise up again.\nYet one thing is left me whereby I may atone to the offended majesty of\nthe law and restore the order which I have violated. A victim is\nrequired--a victim to declare before all mankind how inviolable that\nmajesty is--that victim shall be myself. I will be the death-offering!\n\nROBBERS. Take his sword from him--he will kill himself.\n\nCHARLES. Fools that ye are! doomed to eternal blindness! Think ye\nthat one mortal sin will expiate other mortal sins? Do you suppose that\nthe harmony of the world would be promoted by such an impious discord?\n(Throwing his arms at their feet.) He shall have me alive. I go to\ndeliver myself into the hands of justice.\n\nROBBERS. Put him in chains! he has lost his senses!\n\nCHARLES. Not that I have any doubt but that justice would find me\nspeedily enough if the powers above so ordained it. But she might\nsurprise me in sleep, or overtake me in flight, or seize me with\nviolence and the sword, and then I should have lost the only merit left\nme, that of making my death a free-will atonement. Why should I, like a\nthief, any longer conceal a life, which in the counsels of the heavenly\nministry has long been forfeited?\n\nROBBERS. Let him go. He is infected with the great-man-mania; he means\nto offer up his life for empty admiration.\n\nCHARLES. I might, 'tis true, be admired for it. (After a moment's\nreflection.) I remember, on my way hither, talking to a poor creature,\na day-laborer, with eleven living children. A reward has been offered\nof a thousand louis-d'ors to any one who shall deliver up the great\nrobber alive. That man shall be served.\n                              [Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Robbers, by Frederich Schiller\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ROBBERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6782.txt or 6782.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/6\/7\/8\/6782\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":220,"split":"train"}
