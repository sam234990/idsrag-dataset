Five years ago she lost, in quick succession, her husband and her baby. She used to be \"a rather fast New York girl\" before her marriage but now is virtually unable to get over the great loss she has suffered.\nBored stiff by New York society, Madeleine Lee decides to go to Washington to be close to the hub of politics. Together with her sister Sybil Ross, she arrives in the capital, and in no time her salon becomes the meeting place of important people in the city. Although she has no intention whatsoever of becoming romantically involved, two men eventually emerge from the group gathering around her both of whom would very much like to marry her: John Carrington, who is truly and deeply in love with her; and Silas P. Ratcliffe, whose marriage to Madeleine Lee would help him advance his political career.\nOver the months, Madeleine Lee gets more and more insight into the machinations at the center of political life. Seeing his chances fade, Ratcliffe devises a sophisticated scheme to get rid of John Carrington: he secures a post abroad for his rival, who\u00e2\u0080\u0094as the job is rather well-paid and his family has little money\u00e2\u0080\u0094cannot but accept the offer. Step by step, Ratcliffe manoeuvres Madeleine Lee into a difficult position in which he thinks the only choice left to her will be to marry him. Carrington, however, has left behind a sealed letter in which he accuses Ratcliffe of being corrupt. In particular, he accuses him of having taken graft during the election campaign eight years ago. All evidence, Carrington adds, has been destroyed, so it is his word against Ratcliffe's. The latter of course denies all allegations, but Madeleine Lee is so shocked at the revelation that she turns down Ratcliffe's proposal of marriage. Furious, Ratcliffe leaves Madeleine's house, only to be accosted and ridiculed by his arch-enemy Baron Jacobi, the Bulgarian minister. There even ensues a brief scene of physical violence between the two, but at the very last moment Ratcliffe, whose career would be ruined otherwise, is able to keep his wrath in check.\nDisillusioned by politics, Madeleine Lee now wants to go abroad, preferably to Egypt. Sybil, who has become Carrington's confidante, writes him a letter in which she tells him he should try again to win her sister's heart once they have returned from their tour.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Democracy An American Novel, by Henry Adams\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It wasn't until the 1925 edition that Adams\nwas listed as author. Henry Adams remarked (ironically as usual),\n\"The wholesale piracy of Democracy was the single real triumph of my\nlife.\"--it was very popular, as readers tried to guess who the author\nwas and who the characters really were. Chapters XII and XIII were\noriginally misnumbered.\n\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\n\nFOR reasons which many persons thought ridiculous, Mrs. Lightfoot Lee\ndecided to pass the winter in Washington. She was in excellent health,\nbut she said that the climate would do her good. In New York she had\ntroops of friends, but she suddenly became eager to see again the very\nsmall number of those who lived on the Potomac. It was only to her\nclosest intimates that she honestly acknowledged herself to be tortured\nby ennui. Since her husband's death, five years before, she had lost\nher taste for New York society; she had felt no interest in the price\nof stocks, and very little in the men who dealt in them; she had become\nserious. What was it all worth, this wilderness of men and women as\nmonotonous as the brown stone houses they lived in? In her despair\nshe had resorted to desperate measures. She had read philosophy in the\noriginal German, and the more she read, the more she was disheartened\nthat so much culture should lead to nothing--nothing.\n\nAfter talking of Herbert Spencer for an entire evening with a very\nliterary transcendental commission-merchant, she could not see that her\ntime had been better employed than when in former days she had passed it\nin flirting with a very agreeable young stock-broker; indeed, there\nwas an evident proof to the contrary, for the flirtation might lead to\nsomething--had, in fact, led to marriage; while the philosophy could\nlead to nothing, unless it were perhaps to another evening of the\nsame kind, because transcendental philosophers are mostly elderly men,\nusually married, and, when engaged in business, somewhat apt to be\nsleepy towards evening. Nevertheless Mrs. Lee did her best to turn her\nstudy to practical use. She plunged into philanthropy, visited prisons,\ninspected hospitals, read the literature of pauperism and crime,\nsaturated herself with the statistics of vice, until her mind had nearly\nlost sight of virtue. At last it rose in rebellion against her, and\nshe came to the limit of her strength. This path, too, seemed to lead\nnowhere. She declared that she had lost the sense of duty, and that, so\nfar as concerned her, all the paupers and criminals in New York might\nhenceforward rise in their majesty and manage every railway on the\ncontinent. Why should she care? What was the city to her? She could\nfind nothing in it that seemed to demand salvation. What gave peculiar\nsanctity to numbers? Why were a million people, who all resembled each\nother, any way more interesting than one person? What aspiration could\nshe help to put into the mind of this great million-armed monster that\nwould make it worth her love or respect? Religion? A thousand powerful\nchurches were doing their best, and she could see no chance for a\nnew faith of which she was to be the inspired prophet. Ambition? High\npopular ideals? Passion for whatever is lofty and pure? The very words\nirritated her. Was she not herself devoured by ambition, and was she not\nnow eating her heart out because she could find no one object worth a\nsacrifice?\n\nWas it ambition--real ambition--or was it mere restlessness that\nmade Mrs. Lightfoot Lee so bitter against New York and Philadelphia,\nBaltimore and Boston, American life in general and all life in\nparticular? What did she want? Not social position, for she herself was\nan eminently respectable Philadelphian by birth; her father a famous\nclergyman; and her husband had been equally irreproachable, a descendant\nof one branch of the Virginia Lees, which had drifted to New York in\nsearch of fortune, and had found it, or enough of it to keep the young\nman there. His widow had her own place in society which no one disputed.\nThough not brighter than her neighbours, the world persisted in classing\nher among clever women; she had wealth, or at least enough of it to give\nher all that money can give by way of pleasure to a sensible woman in an\nAmerican city; she had her house and her carriage; she dressed well; her\ntable was good, and her furniture was never allowed to fall behind the\nlatest standard of decorative art. She had travelled in Europe, and\nafter several visits, covering some years of time, had returned home,\ncarrying in one hand, as it were, a green-grey landscape, a remarkably\npleasing specimen of Corot, and in the other some bales of Persian and\nSyrian rugs and embroideries, Japanese bronzes and porcelain. With this\nshe declared Europe to be exhausted, and she frankly avowed that she was\nAmerican to the tips of her fingers; she neither knew nor greatly cared\nwhether America or Europe were best to live in; she had no violent love\nfor either, and she had no objection to abusing both; but she meant to\nget all that American life had to offer, good or bad, and to drink it\ndown to the dregs, fully determined that whatever there was in it\nshe would have, and that whatever could be made out of it she would\nmanufacture. \"I know,\" said she, \"that America produces petroleum and\npigs; I have seen both on the steamers; and I am told it produces silver\nand gold. There is choice enough for any woman.\"\n\nYet, as has been already said, Mrs. Lee's first experience was not a\nsuccess. She soon declared that New York might represent the petroleum\nor the pigs, but the gold of life was not to be discovered there by her\neyes.\n\nNot but that there was variety enough; a variety of people, occupations,\naims, and thoughts; but that all these, after growing to a certain\nheight, stopped short. They found nothing to hold them up. She knew,\nmore or less intimately, a dozen men whose fortunes ranged between one\nmillion and forty millions. What did they do with their money? What\ncould they do with it that was different from what other men did? After\nall, it is absurd to spend more money than is enough to satisfy all\none's wants; it is vulgar to live in two houses in the same street, and\nto drive six horses abreast. Yet, after setting aside a certain income\nsufficient for all one's wants, what was to be done with the rest? To\nlet it accumulate was to own one's failure; Mrs. Lee's great grievance\nwas that it did accumulate, without changing or improving the quality\nof its owners. To spend it in charity and public works was doubtless\npraiseworthy, but was it wise? Mrs. Lee had read enough political\neconomy and pauper reports to be nearly convinced that public work\nshould be public duty, and that great benefactions do harm as well as\ngood.\n\nAnd even supposing it spent on these objects, how could it do more than\nincrease and perpetuate that same kind of human nature which was her\ngreat grievance? Her New York friends could not meet this question\nexcept by falling back upon their native commonplaces, which she\nrecklessly trampled upon, averring that, much as she admired the genius\nof the famous traveller, Mr. Gulliver, she never had been able, since\nshe became a widow, to accept the Brobdingnagian doctrine that he who\nmade two blades of grass grow where only one grew before deserved better\nof mankind than the whole race of politicians. She would not find fault\nwith the philosopher had he required that the grass should be of an\nimproved quality; \"but,\" said she, \"I cannot honestly pretend that I\nshould be pleased to see two New York men where I now see one; the idea\nis too ridiculous; more than one and a half would be fatal to me.\"\n\nThen came her Boston friends, who suggested that higher education was\nprecisely what she wanted; she should throw herself into a crusade for\nuniversities and art-schools. Mrs. Lee turned upon them with a sweet\nsmile; \"Do you know,\" said she, \"that we have in New York already the\nrichest university in America, and that its only trouble has always been\nthat it can get no scholars even by paying for them? Do you want me to\ngo out into the streets and waylay boys? If the heathen refuse to be\nconverted, can you give me power over the stake and the sword to compel\nthem to come in? And suppose you can? Suppose I march all the boys in\nFifth Avenue down to the university and have them all properly taught\nGreek and Latin, English literature, ethics, and German philosophy.\nWhat then? You do it in Boston. Now tell me honestly what comes of it. I\nsuppose you have there a brilliant society; numbers of poets, scholars,\nphilosophers, statesmen, all up and down Beacon Street. Your evenings\nmust be sparkling. Your press must scintillate. How is it that we New\nYorkers never hear of it? We don't go much into your society; but when\nwe do, it doesn't seem so very much better than our own. You are just\nlike the rest of us. You grow six inches high, and then you stop. Why\nwill not somebody grow to be a tree and cast a shadow?\"\n\nThe average member of New York society, although not unused to this\ncontemptuous kind of treatment from his leaders, retaliated in his\nblind, common-sense way. \"What does the woman want?\" he said. \"Is her\nhead turned with the Tulieries and Marlborough House? Does she think\nherself made for a throne? Why does she not lecture for women's rights?\nWhy not go on the stage? If she cannot be contented like other people,\nwhat need is there for abusing us just because she feels herself no\ntaller than we are? What does she expect to get from her sharp tongue?\nWhat does she know, any way?\"\n\nMrs. Lee certainly knew very little. She had read voraciously and\npromiscuously one subject after another. Ruskin and Taine had danced\nmerrily through her mind, hand in hand with Darwin and Stuart Mill,\nGustave Droz and Algernon Swinburne. She had even laboured over the\nliterature of her own country. She was perhaps, the only woman in New\nYork who knew something of American history. Certainly she could not\nhave repeated the list of Presidents in their order, but she knew that\nthe Constitution divided the government into Executive, Legislative, and\nJudiciary; she was aware that the President, the Speaker, and the\nChief Justice were important personages, and instinctively she wondered\nwhether they might not solve her problem; whether they were the shade\ntrees which she saw in her dreams.\n\nHere, then, was the explanation of her restlessness, discontent,\nambition,--call it what you will. It was the feeling of a passenger on\nan ocean steamer whose mind will not give him rest until he has been in\nthe engine-room and talked with the engineer. She wanted to see with her\nown eyes the action of primary forces; to touch with her own hand the\nmassive machinery of society; to measure with her own mind the capacity\nof the motive power. She was bent upon getting to the heart of the great\nAmerican mystery of democracy and government. She cared little where\nher pursuit might lead her, for she put no extravagant value upon life,\nhaving already, as she said, exhausted at least two lives, and being\nfairly hardened to insensibility in the process. \"To lose a husband and\na baby,\" said she, \"and keep one's courage and reason, one must become\nvery hard or very soft. I am now pure steel. You may beat my heart with\na trip-hammer and it will beat the trip-hammer back again.\"\n\nPerhaps after exhausting the political world she might try again\nelsewhere; she did not pretend to say where she might then go, or what\nshe should do; but at present she meant to see what amusement there\nmight be in politics.\n\nHer friends asked what kind of amusement she expected to find among\nthe illiterate swarm of ordinary people who in Washington represented\nconstituencies so dreary that in comparison New York was a New\nJerusalem, and Broad Street a grove of Academe. She replied that if\nWashington society were so bad as this, she should have gained all she\nwanted, for it would be a pleasure to return,--precisely the feeling she\nlonged for. In her own mind, however, she frowned on the idea of\nseeking for men. What she wished to see, she thought, was the clash\nof interests, the interests of forty millions of people and a whole\ncontinent, centering at Washington; guided, restrained, controlled,\nor unrestrained and uncontrollable, by men of ordinary mould; the\ntremendous forces of government, and the machinery of society, at work.\nWhat she wanted, was POWER.\n\nPerhaps the force of the engine was a little confused in her mind with\nthat of the engineer, the power with the men who wielded it. Perhaps the\nhuman interest of politics was after all what really attracted her, and,\nhowever strongly she might deny it, the passion for exercising power,\nfor its own sake, might dazzle and mislead a woman who had exhausted all\nthe ordinary feminine resources. But why speculate about her motives?\nThe stage was before her, the curtain was rising, the actors were ready\nto enter; she had only to go quietly on among the supernumeraries and\nsee how the play was acted and the stage effects were produced; how the\ngreat tragedians mouthed, and the stage-manager swore.\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nON the first of December, Mrs. Lee took the train for Washington, and\nbefore five o'clock that evening she was entering her newly hired\nhouse on Lafayette Square. She shrugged her shoulders with a mingled\nexpression of contempt and grief at the curious barbarism of the\ncurtains and the wall-papers, and her next two days were occupied with\na life-and-death struggle to get the mastery over her surroundings. In\nthis awful contest the interior of the doomed house suffered as though\na demon were in it; not a chair, not a mirror, not a carpet, was left\nuntouched, and in the midst of the worst confusion the new mistress sat,\ncalm as the statue of Andrew Jackson in the square under her eyes, and\nissued her orders with as much decision as that hero had ever shown.\nTowards the close of the second day, victory crowned her forehead. A\nnew era, a nobler conception of duty and existence, had dawned upon\nthat benighted and heathen residence. The wealth of Syria and Persia was\npoured out upon the melancholy Wilton carpets; embroidered comets and\nwoven gold from Japan and Teheran depended from and covered over every\nsad stuff-curtain; a strange medley of sketches, paintings, fans,\nembroideries, and porcelain was hung, nailed, pinned, or stuck against\nthe wall; finally the domestic altarpiece, the mystical Corot landscape,\nwas hoisted to its place over the parlour fire, and then all was over.\nThe setting sun streamed softly in at the windows, and peace reigned in\nthat redeemed house and in the heart of its mistress.\n\n\"I think it will do now, Sybil,\" said she, surveying the scene.\n\n\"It must,\" replied Sybil. \"You haven't a plate or a fan or coloured\nscarf left. You must send out and buy some of these old negro-women's\nbandannas if you are going to cover anything else. What is the use? Do\nyou suppose any human being in Washington will like it? They will think\nyou demented.\"\n\n\"There is such a thing as self-respect,\" replied her sister, calmly.\n\nSybil--Miss Sybil Ross--was Madeleine Lee's sister. The keenest\npsychologist could not have detected a single feature quality which they\nhad in common, and for that reason they were devoted friends. Madeleine\nwas thirty, Sybil twenty-four. Madeleine was indescribable; Sybil was\ntransparent. Madeleine was of medium height with a graceful figure,\na well-set head, and enough golden-brown hair to frame a face full of\nvarying expression. Her eyes were never for two consecutive hours of the\nsame shade, but were more often blue than grey. People who envied her\nsmile said that she cultivated a sense of humour in order to show her\nteeth. Perhaps they were right; but there was no doubt that her habit\nof talking with gesticulation would never have grown upon her unless\nshe had known that her hands were not only beautiful but expressive.\nShe dressed as skilfully as New York women do, but in growing older\nshe began to show symptoms of dangerous unconventionality. She had been\nheard to express a low opinion of her countrywomen who blindly fell down\nbefore the golden calf of Mr. Worth, and she had even fought a battle\nof great severity, while it lasted, with one of her best-dressed\nfriends who had been invited--and had gone--to Mr. Worth's afternoon\ntea-parties. The secret was that Mrs. Lee had artistic tendencies, and\nunless they were checked in time, there was no knowing what might be\nthe consequence. But as yet they had done no harm; indeed, they rather\nhelped to give her that sort of atmosphere which belongs only to certain\nwomen; as indescribable as the afterglow; as impalpable as an Indian\nsummer mist; and non-existent except to people who feel rather than\nreason. Sybil had none of it. The imagination gave up all attempts\nto soar where she came. A more straightforward, downright, gay,\nsympathetic, shallow, warm-hearted, sternly practical young woman has\nrarely touched this planet. Her mind had room for neither grave-stones\nnor guide-books; she could not have lived in the past or the future if\nshe had spent her days in churches and her nights in tombs. \"She was\nnot clever, like Madeleine, thank Heaven.\" Madeleine was not an orthodox\nmember of the church; sermons bored her, and clergymen never failed to\nirritate every nerve in her excitable system. Sybil was a simple and\ndevout worshipper at the ritualistic altar; she bent humbly before the\nPaulist fathers. When she went to a ball she always had the best partner\nin the room, and took it as a matter of course; but then, she always\nprayed for one; somehow it strengthened her faith. Her sister took care\nnever to laugh at her on this score, or to shock her religious opinions.\n\"Time enough,\" said she, \"for her to forget religion when religion\nfails her.\" As for regular attendance at church, Madeleine was able to\nreconcile their habits without trouble. She herself had not entered a\nchurch for years; she said it gave her unchristian feelings; but Sybil\nhad a voice of excellent quality, well trained and cultivated:\nMadeleine insisted that she should sing in the choir, and by this\nlittle manoeuvre, the divergence of their paths was made less evident.\nMadeleine did not sing, and therefore could not go to church with Sybil.\nThis outrageous fallacy seemed perfectly to answer its purpose, and\nSybil accepted it, in good faith, as a fair working principle which\nexplained itself.\n\nMadeleine was sober in her tastes. She wasted no money. She made no\ndisplay.\n\nShe walked rather than drove, and wore neither diamonds nor brocades.\nBut the general impression she made was nevertheless one of luxury. On\nthe other hand, her sister had her dresses from Paris, and wore them\nand her ornaments according to all the formulas; she was good-naturedly\ncorrect, and bent her round white shoulders to whatever burden the\nParisian autocrat chose to put upon them. Madeleine never interfered,\nand always paid the bills.\n\nBefore they had been ten days in Washington, they fell gently into their\nplace and were carried along without an effort on the stream of social\nlife.\n\nSociety was kind; there was no reason for its being otherwise. Mrs. Lee\nand her sister had no enemies, held no offices, and did their best to\nmake themselves popular. Sybil had not passed summers at Newport and\nwinters in New York in vain; and neither her face nor her figure, her\nvoice nor her dancing, needed apology. Politics were not her strong\npoint. She was induced to go once to the Capitol and to sit ten minutes\nin the gallery of the Senate. No one ever knew what her impressions\nwere; with feminine tact she managed not to betray herself But, in\ntruth, her notion of legislative bodies was vague, floating between her\nexperience at church and at the opera, so that the idea of a performance\nof some kind was never out of her head. To her mind the Senate was a\nplace where people went to recite speeches, and she naively assumed that\nthe speeches were useful and had a purpose, but as they did not interest\nher she never went again. This is a very common conception of Congress;\nmany Congressmen share it.\n\nHer sister was more patient and bolder. She went to the Capitol nearly\nevery day for at least two weeks. At the end of that time her interest\nbegan to flag, and she thought it better to read the debates every\nmorning in the Congressional Record. Finding this a laborious and not\nalways an instructive task, she began to skip the dull parts; and in\nthe absence of any exciting question, she at last resigned herself\nto skipping the whole. Nevertheless she still had energy to visit the\nSenate gallery occasionally when she was told that a splendid orator\nwas about to speak on a question of deep interest to his country.\nShe listened with a little disposition to admire, if she could; and,\nwhenever she could, she did admire. She said nothing, but she listened\nsharply. She wanted to learn how the machinery of government worked,\nand what was the quality of the men who controlled it. One by one, she\npassed them through her crucibles, and tested them by acids and by fire.\n\nA few survived her tests and came out alive, though more or less\ndisfigured, where she had found impurities. Of the whole number, only\none retained under this process enough character to interest her.\n\nIn these early visits to Congress, Mrs. Lee sometimes had the company\nof John Carrington, a Washington lawyer about forty years old, who, by\nvirtue of being a Virginian and a distant connection of her husband,\ncalled himself a cousin, and took a tone of semi-intimacy, which Mrs.\nLee accepted because Carrington was a man whom she liked, and because\nhe was one whom life had treated hardly. He was of that unfortunate\ngeneration in the south which began existence with civil war, and he was\nperhaps the more unfortunate because, like most educated Virginians of\nthe old Washington school, he had seen from the first that, whatever\nissue the war took, Virginia and he must be ruined. At twenty-two he had\ngone into the rebel army as a private and carried his musket modestly\nthrough a campaign or two, after which he slowly rose to the rank of\nsenior captain in his regiment, and closed his services on the staff of\na major-general, always doing scrupulously enough what he conceived to\nbe his duty, and never doing it with enthusiasm. When the rebel armies\nsurrendered, he rode away to his family plantation--not a difficult\nthing to do, for it was only a few miles from Appomatox--and at once\nbegan to study law; then, leaving his mother and sisters to do what\nthey could with the worn-out plantation, he began the practice of law\nin Washington, hoping thus to support himself and them. He had succeeded\nafter a fashion, and for the first time the future seemed not absolutely\ndark. Mrs. Lee's house was an oasis to him, and he found himself, to\nhis surprise, almost gay in her company. The gaiety was of a very quiet\nkind, and Sybil, while friendly with him, averred that he was certainly\ndull; but this dulness had a fascination for Madeleine, who, having\ntasted many more kinds of the wine of life than Sybil, had learned to\nvalue certain delicacies of age and flavour that were lost upon younger\nand coarser palates. He talked rather slowly and almost with effort, but\nhe had something of the dignity--others call it stiffness--of the\nold Virginia school, and twenty years of constant responsibility\nand deferred hope had added a touch of care that bordered closely on\nsadness. His great attraction was that he never talked or seemed to\nthink of himself. Mrs. Lee trusted in him by instinct. \"He is a type!\"\nsaid she; \"he is my idea of George Washington at thirty.\"\n\nOne morning in December, Carrington entered Mrs. Lee's parlour towards\nnoon, and asked if she cared to visit the Capitol.\n\n\"You will have a chance of hearing to-day what may be the last great\nspeech of our greatest statesman,\" said he; \"you should come.\"\n\n\"A splendid sample of our native raw material, sir?\" asked she,\nfresh from a reading of Dickens, and his famous picture of American\nstatesmanship.\n\n\"Precisely so,\" said Carrington; \"the Prairie Giant of Peonia, the\nFavourite Son of Illinois; the man who came within three votes of\ngetting the party nomination for the Presidency last spring, and was\nonly defeated because ten small intriguers are sharper than one big one.\nThe Honourable Silas P. Ratcliffe, Senator from Illinois; he will be run\nfor the Presidency yet.\"\n\n\"What does the P. stand for?\" asked Sybil.\n\n\"I don't remember ever to have heard his middle name,\" said Carrington.\n\n\"Perhaps it is Peonia or Prairie; I can't say.\"\n\n\"He is the man whose appearance struck me so much when we were in the\nSenate last week, is he not? A great, ponderous man, over six feet\nhigh, very senatorial and dignified, with a large head and rather good\nfeatures?\" inquired Mrs. Lee.\n\n\"The same,\" replied Carrington. \"By all means hear him speak. He is\nthe stumbling-block of the new President, who is to be allowed no peace\nunless he makes terms with Ratcliffe; and so every one thinks that the\nPrairie Giant of Peonia will have the choice of the State or Treasury\nDepartment. If he takes either it will be the Treasury, for he is a\ndesperate political manager, and will want the patronage for the next\nnational convention.\"\n\nMrs. Lee was delighted to hear the debate, and Carrington was delighted\nto sit through it by her side, and to exchange running comments with her\non the speeches and the speakers.\n\n\"Have you ever met the Senator?\" asked she.\n\n\"I have acted several times as counsel before his committees. He is an\nexcellent chairman, always attentive and generally civil.\"\n\n\"Where was he born?\"\n\n\"The family is a New England one, and I believe respectable. He came, I\nthink, from some place in the Connecticut Valley, but whether Vermont,\nNew Hampshire, or Massachusetts, I don't know.\"\n\n\"Is he an educated man?\"\n\n\"He got a kind of classical education at one of the country colleges\nthere. I suspect he has as much education as is good for him. But he\nwent West very soon after leaving college, and being then young and\nfresh from that hot-bed of abolition, he threw himself into the\nanti-slavery movement in Illinois, and after a long struggle he rose\nwith the wave. He would not do the same thing now.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"He is older, more experienced, and not so wise. Besides, he has no\nlonger the time to wait. Can you see his eyes from here? I call them\nYankee eyes.\"\n\n\"Don't abuse the Yankees,\" said Mrs. Lee; \"I am half Yankee myself.\"\n\n\"Is that abuse? Do you mean to deny that they have eyes?\"\n\n\"I concede that there may be eyes among them; but Virginians are not\nfair judges of their expression.\"\n\n\"Cold eyes,\" he continued; \"steel grey, rather small, not unpleasant in\ngood-humour, diabolic in a passion, but worst when a little suspicious;\nthen they watch you as though you were a young rattle-snake, to be\nkilled when convenient.\"\n\n\"Does he not look you in the face?\"\n\n\"Yes; but not as though he liked you. His eyes only seem to ask the\npossible uses you might be put to. Ah, the vice-president has given him\nthe floor; now we shall have it. Hard voice, is it not? like his eyes.\nHard manner, like his voice. Hard all through.\"\n\n\"What a pity he is so dreadfully senatorial!\" said Mrs. Lee; \"otherwise\nI rather admire him.\"\n\n\"Now he is settling down to his work,\" continued Carrington. \"See how he\ndodges all the sharp issues. What a thing it is to be a Yankee! What a\ngenius the fellow has for leading a party! Do you see how well it is all\ndone? The new President flattered and conciliated, the party united and\ngiven a strong lead. And now we shall see how the President will deal\nwith him. Ten to one on Ratcliffe. Come, there is that stupid ass from\nMissouri getting up. Let us go.\"\n\nAs they passed down the steps and out into the Avenue, Mrs. Lee turned\nto Carrington as though she had been reflecting deeply and had at length\nreached a decision.\n\n\"Mr. Carrington,\" said she, \"I want to know Senator Ratcliffe.\"\n\n\"You will meet him to-morrow evening,\" replied Carrington, \"at your\nsenatorial dinner.\"\n\nThe Senator from New York, the Honourable Schuyler Clinton, was an old\nadmirer of Mrs. Lee, and his wife was a cousin of hers, more or less\ndistant. They had lost no time in honouring the letter of credit she\nthus had upon them, and invited her and her sister to a solemn dinner,\nas imposing as political dignity could make it. Mr. Carrington, as a\nconnection of hers, was one of the party, and almost the only one among\nthe twenty persons at table who had neither an office, nor a title, nor\na constituency.\n\nSenator Clinton received Mrs. Lee and her sister with tender enthusiasm,\nfor they were attractive specimens of his constituents. He pressed their\nhands and evidently restrained himself only by an effort from embracing\nthem, for the Senator had a marked regard for pretty women, and had made\nlove to every girl with any pretensions to beauty that had appeared\nin the State of New York for fully half a century. At the same time\nhe whispered an apology in her ear; he regretted so much that he was\nobliged to forego the pleasure of taking her to dinner; Washington was\nthe only city in America where this could have happened, but it was a\nfact that ladies here were very great stickiers for etiquette; on the\nother hand he had the sad consolation that she would be the gainer,\nfor he had allotted to her Lord Skye, the British Minister, \"a most\nagreeable man and not married, as I have the misfortune to be;\" and on\nthe other side \"I have ventured to place Senator Ratcliffe, of Illinois,\nwhose admirable speech I saw you listening to with such rapt attention\nyesterday. I thought you might like to know him. Did I do right?\"\n\nMadeleine assured him that he had divined her inmost wishes, and he\nturned with even more warmth of affection to her sister: \"As for you, my\ndear--dear Sybil, what can I do to make your dinner agreeable? If I give\nyour sister a coronet, I am only sorry not to have a diadem for you. But\nI have done everything in my power. The first Secretary of the Russian\nLegation, Count Popoff, will take you in; a charming young man, my dear\nSybil; and on your other side I have placed the Assistant Secretary of\nState, whom you know.\"\n\nAnd so, after the due delay, the party settled themselves at the\ndinner-table, and Mrs. Lee found Senator Ratcliffe's grey eyes resting\non her face for a moment as they sat down.\n\nLord Skye was very agreeable, and, at almost any other moment of her\nlife, Mrs. Lee would have liked nothing better than to talk with him\nfrom the beginning to the end of her dinner. Tall, slender, bald-headed,\nawkward, and stammering with his elaborate British stammer whenever it\nsuited his convenience to do so; a sharp observer who had wit which he\ncommonly concealed; a humourist who was satisfied to laugh silently at\nhis own humour; a diplomatist who used the mask of frankness with great\neffect; Lord Skye was one of the most popular men in Washington. Every\none knew that he was a ruthless critic of American manners, but he had\nthe art to combine ridicule with good-humour, and he was all the more\npopular accordingly. He was an outspoken admirer of American women\nin everything except their voices, and he did not even shrink from\noccasionally quizzing a little the national peculiarities of his own\ncountrywomen; a sure piece of flattery to their American cousins. He\nwould gladly have devoted himself to Mrs. Lee, but decent civility\nrequired that he should pay some attention to his hostess, and he was\ntoo good a diplomatist not to be attentive to a hostess who was the wife\nof a Senator, and that Senator the chairman of the committee of foreign\nrelations.\n\nThe moment his head was turned, Mrs. Lee dashed at her Peonia Giant, who\nwas then consuming his fish, and wishing he understood why the British\nMinister had worn no gloves, while he himself had sacrificed his\nconvictions by wearing the largest and whitest pair of French kids that\ncould be bought for money on Pennsylvania Avenue. There was a little\ntouch of mortification in the idea that he was not quite at home among\nfashionable people, and at this instant he felt that true happiness was\nonly to be found among the simple and honest sons and daughters of toil.\nA certain secret jealousy of the British Minister is always lurking in\nthe breast of every American Senator, if he is truly democratic; for\ndemocracy, rightly understood, is the government of the people, by the\npeople, for the benefit of Senators, and there is always a danger that\nthe British Minister may not understand this political principle as he\nshould. Lord Skye had run the risk of making two blunders; of offending\nthe Senator from New York by neglecting his wife, and the Senator from\nIllinois by engrossing the attention of Mrs. Lee. A young Englishman\nwould have done both, but Lord Skye had studied the American\nconstitution. The wife of the Senator from New York now thought him most\nagreeable, and at the same moment the Senator from Illinois awoke to the\nconviction that after all, even in frivolous and fashionable circles,\ntrue dignity is in no danger of neglect; an American Senator\nrepresents a sovereign state; the great state of Illinois is as big\nas England--with the convenient omission of Wales, Scotland, Ireland,\nCanada, India, Australia, and a few other continents and islands; and in\nshort, it was perfectly clear that Lord Skye was not formidable to him,\neven in light society; had not Mrs. Lee herself as good as said that no\nposition equalled that of an American Senator?\n\nIn ten minutes Mrs. Lee had this devoted statesman at her feet. She had\nnot studied the Senate without a purpose. She had read with unerring\ninstinct one general characteristic of all Senators, a boundless\nand guileless thirst for flattery, engendered by daily draughts from\npolitical friends or dependents, then becoming a necessity like a dram,\nand swallowed with a heavy smile of ineffable content. A single glance\nat Mr. Ratcliffe's face showed Madeleine that she need not be afraid\nof flattering too grossly; her own self-respect, not his, was the only\nrestraint upon her use of this feminine bait.\n\nShe opened upon him with an apparent simplicity and gravity, a quiet\nrepose of manner, and an evident consciousness of her own strength,\nwhich meant that she was most dangerous.\n\n\"I heard your speech yesterday, Mr. Ratcliffe. I am glad to have a\nchance of telling you how much I was impressed by it. It seemed to me\nmasterly. Do you not find that it has had a great effect?\"\n\n\"I thank you, madam. I hope it will help to unite the party, but as yet\nwe have had no time to measure its results. That will require several\ndays more.\" The Senator spoke in his senatorial manner, elaborate,\ncondescending, and a little on his guard.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Mrs. Lee, turning towards him as though he were a\nvalued friend, and looking deep into his eyes, \"Do you know that every\none told me I should be shocked by the falling off in political ability\nat Washington? I did not believe them, and since hearing your speech I\nam sure they are mistaken. Do you yourself think there is less ability\nin Congress than there used to be?\"\n\n\"Well, madam, it is difficult to answer that question. Government is not\nso easy now as it was formerly. There are different customs. There are\nmany men of fair abilities in public life; many more than there used to\nbe; and there is sharper criticism and more of it.\"\n\n\"Was I right in thinking that you have a strong resemblance to Daniel\nWebster in your way of speaking? You come from the same neighbourhood,\ndo you not?\"\n\nMrs. Lee here hit on Ratcliffe's weak point; the outline of his head\nhad, in fact, a certain resemblance to that of Webster, and he prided\nhimself upon it, and on a distant relationship to the Expounder of the\nConstitution; he began to think that Mrs. Lee was a very intelligent\nperson. His modest admission of the resemblance gave her the opportunity\nto talk of Webster's oratory, and the conversation soon spread to a\ndiscussion of the merits of Clay and Calhoun. The Senator found that his\nneighbour--a fashionable New York woman, exquisitely dressed, and with\na voice and manner seductively soft and gentle--had read the speeches of\nWebster and Calhoun. She did not think it necessary to tell him that she\nhad persuaded the honest Carrington to bring her the volumes and to mark\nsuch passages as were worth her reading; but she took care to lead the\nconversation, and she criticised with some skill and more humour the\nweak points in Websterian oratory, saying with a little laugh and a\nglance into his delighted eyes:\n\n\"My judgment may not be worth much, Mr. Senator, but it does seem to me\nthat our fathers thought too much of themselves, and till you teach\nme better I shall continue to think that the passage in your speech\nof yesterday which began with, 'Our strength lies in this twisted and\ntangled mass of isolated principles, the hair of the half-sleeping giant\nof Party,' is both for language and imagery quite equal to anything of\nWebster's.\"\n\nThe Senator from Illinois rose to this gaudy fly like a huge,\ntwo-hundred-pound salmon; his white waistcoat gave out a mild silver\nreflection as he slowly came to the surface and gorged the hook. He made\nnot even a plunge, not one perceptible effort to tear out the barbed\nweapon, but, floating gently to her feet, allowed himself to be landed\nas though it were a pleasure. Only miserable casuists will ask whether\nthis was fair play on Madeleine's part; whether flattery so gross\ncost her conscience no twinge, and whether any woman can without\nself-abasement be guilty of such shameless falsehood. She, however,\nscorned the idea of falsehood. She would have defended herself by saying\nthat she had not so much praised Ratcliffe as depreciated Webster,\nand that she was honest in her opinion of the old-fashioned American\noratory. But she could not deny that she had wilfully allowed the\nSenator to draw conclusions very different from any she actually held.\nShe could not deny that she had intended to flatter him to the extent\nnecessary for her purpose, and that she was pleased at her success.\nBefore they rose from table the Senator had quite unbent himself; he\nwas talking naturally, shrewdly, and with some humour; he had told her\nIllinois stories; spoken with extraordinary freedom about his political\nsituation; and expressed the wish to call upon Mrs. Lee, if he could\never hope to find her at home.\n\n\"I am always at home on Sunday evenings,\" said she.\n\nTo her eyes he was the high-priest of American politics; he was charged\nwith the meaning of the mysteries, the clue to political hieroglyphics.\nThrough him she hoped to sound the depths of statesmanship and to\nbring up from its oozy bed that pearl of which she was in search; the\nmysterious gem which must lie hidden somewhere in politics. She wanted\nto understand this man; to turn him inside out; to experiment on him and\nuse him as young physiologists use frogs and kittens. If there was good\nor bad in him, she meant to find its meaning.\n\nAnd he was a western widower of fifty; his quarters in Washington were\nin gaunt boarding-house rooms, furnished only with public documents and\nenlivened by western politicians and office-seekers. In the summer he\nretired to a solitary, white framehouse with green blinds, surrounded\nby a few feet of uncared-for grass and a white fence; its interior more\ndreary still, with iron stoves, oil-cloth carpets, cold white walls, and\none large engraving of Abraham Lincoln in the parlour; all in Peonia,\nIllinois! What equality was there between these two combatants? what\nhope for him? what risk for her? And yet Madeleine Lee had fully her\nmatch in Mr. Silas P. Ratcliffe.\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nMRS. Lee soon became popular. Her parlour was a favourite haunt of\ncertain men and women who had the art of finding its mistress at home;\nan art which seemed not to be within the powers of everybody. Carrington\nwas apt to be there more often than any one else, so that he was looked\non as almost a part of the family, and if Madeleine wanted a book from\nthe library, or an extra man at her dinner-table, Carrington was pretty\ncertain to help her to the one or the other. Old Baron Jacobi, the\nBulgarian minister, fell madly in love with both sisters, as he commonly\ndid with every pretty face and neat figure. He was a witty, cynical,\nbroken-down Parisian rou\u00c3\u00a9, kept in Washington for years past by his\ndebts and his salary; always grumbling because there was no opera, and\nmysteriously disappearing on visits to New York; a voracious devourer of\nFrench and German literature, especially of novels; a man who seemed to\nhave met every noted or notorious personage of the century, and whose\nmind was a magazine of amusing information; an excellent musical critic,\nwho was not afraid to criticise Sybil's singing; a connoisseur in\nbric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac, who laughed at Madeleine's display of odds and ends, and\noccasionally brought her a Persian plate or a bit of embroidery, which\nhe said was good and would do her credit. This old sinner believed in\neverything that was perverse and wicked, but he accepted the prejudices\nof Anglo-Saxon society, and was too clever to obtrude his opinions upon\nothers.\n\nHe would have married both sisters at once more willingly than either\nalone, but as he feelingly said, \"If I were forty years younger,\nmademoiselle, you should not sing to me so calmly.\" His friend\nPopoff, an intelligent, vivacious Russian, with very Calmuck features,\nsusceptible as a girl, and passionately fond of music, hung over Sybil's\npiano by the hour; he brought Russian airs which he taught her to sing,\nand, if the truth were known, he bored Madeleine desperately, for she\nundertook to act the part of duenna to her younger sister.\n\nA very different visitor was Mr. C. C. French, a young member of\nCongress from Connecticut, who aspired to act the part of the educated\ngentleman in politics, and to purify the public tone. He had reform\nprinciples and an unfortunately conceited maimer; he was rather wealthy,\nrather clever, rather well-educated, rather honest, and rather vulgar.\nHis allegiance was divided between Mrs. Lee and her sister, whom he\ninfuriated by addressing as \"Miss Sybil\" with patronising familiarity.\nHe was particularly strong in what he called \"badinaige,\" and his\nplayful but ungainly attempts at wit drove Mrs.\n\nLee beyond the bounds of patience. When in a solemn mood, he talked as\nthough he were practising for the ear of a college debating society,\nand with a still worse effect on the patience; but with all this he was\nuseful, always bubbling with the latest political gossip, and deeply\ninterested in the fate of party stakes. Quite another sort of person was\nMr. Hartbeest Schneidekoupon, a citizen of Philadelphia, though commonly\nresident in New York, where he had fallen a victim to Sybil's charms,\nand made efforts to win her young affections by instructing her in the\nmysteries of currency and protection, to both which subjects he was\ndevoted. To forward these two interests and to watch over Miss Ross's\nwelfare, he made periodical visits to Washington, where he closeted\nhimself with committee-men and gave expensive dinners to members of\nCongress. Mr. Schneidekoupon was rich, and about thirty years old, tall\nand thin, with bright eyes and smooth face, elaborate manners and\nmuch loquacity. He had the reputation of turning rapid intellectual\nsomersaults, partly to amuse himself and partly to startle society. At\none moment he was artistic, and discoursed scientifically about his\nown paintings; at another he was literary, and wrote a book on \"Noble\nLiving,\" with a humanitarian purpose; at another he was devoted to\nsport, rode a steeplechase, played polo, and set up a four-in-hand; his\nlast occupation was to establish in Philadelphia the Protective Review,\na periodical in the interests of American industry, which he edited\nhimself, as a stepping-stone to Congress, the Cabinet, and the\nPresidency. At about the same time he bought a yacht, and heavy bets\nwere pending among his sporting friends whether he would manage to\nsink first his Review or his yacht. But he was an amiable and excellent\nfellow through all his eccentricities, and he brought to Mrs. Lee the\nsimple outpourings of the amateur politician.\n\nA much higher type of character was Mr. Nathan Gore, of Massachusetts,\na handsome man with a grey beard, a straight, sharply cut nose, and a\nfine, penetrating eye; in his youth a successful poet whose satires made\na noise in their day, and are still remembered for the pungency and wit\nof a few verses; then a deep student in Europe for many years, until his\nfamous \"History of Spain in America\" placed him instantly at the head of\nAmerican historians, and made him minister at Madrid, where he remained\nfour years to his entire satisfaction, this being the nearest approach\nto a patent of nobility and a government pension which the American\ncitizen can attain. A change of administration had reduced him to\nprivate life again, and after some years of retirement he was now in\nWashington, willing to be restored to his old mission. Every President\nthinks it respectable to have at least one literary man in his pay, and\nMr. Gore's prospects were fair for obtaining his object, as he had the\nactive support of a majority of the Massachusetts delegation. He was\nabominably selfish, colossally egoistic, and not a little vain; but\nhe was shrewd; he knew how to hold his tongue; he could flatter\ndexterously, and he had learned to eschew satire. Only in confidence and\namong friends he would still talk freely, but Mrs. Lee was not yet on\nthose terms with him. These were all men, and there was no want of women\nin Mrs.\n\nLee's parlour; but, after all, they are able to describe themselves\nbetter than any poor novelist can describe them. Generally two currents\nof conversation ran on together--one round Sybil, the other about\nMadeleine.\n\n\"Mees Ross,\" said Count Popoff, leading in a handsome young foreigner,\n\"I have your permission to present to you my friend Count Orsini,\nSecretary of the Italian Legation. Are you at home this afternoon? Count\nOrsini sings also.\"\n\n\"We are charmed to see Count Orsini. It is well you came so late, for I\nhave this moment come in from making Cabinet calls. They were so queer!\nI have been crying with laughter for an hour past.\" \"Do you find these\ncalls amusing?\" asked Popoff, gravely and diplomatically. \"Indeed I\ndo! I went with Julia Schneidekoupon, you know, Madeleine; the\nSchneidekoupons are descended from all the Kings of Israel, and are\nprouder than Solomon in his glory. And when we got into the house of\nsome dreadful woman from Heaven knows where, imagine my feelings at\noverhearing this conversation: 'What may be your family name, ma'am?'\n'Schneidekoupon is my name,' replies Julia, very tall and straight.\n'Have you any friends whom I should likely know?' 'I think not,' says\nJulia, severely. 'Wal! I don't seem to remember of ever having heerd the\nname. But I s'pose it's all right. I like to know who calls.' I almost\nhad hysterics when we got into the street, but Julia could not see the\njoke at all.\"\n\nCount Orsini was not quite sure that he himself saw the joke, so he only\nsmiled becomingly and showed his teeth. For simple, childlike vanity and\nself-consciousness nothing equals an Italian Secretary of Legation at\ntwenty-five. Yet conscious that the effect of his personal beauty\nwould perhaps be diminished by permanent silence, he ventured to murmur\npresently:\n\n\"Do you not find it very strange, this society in America?\"\n\n\"Society!\" laughed Sybil with gay contempt. \"There are no snakes in\nAmerica, any more than in Norway.\"\n\n\"Snakes, mademoiselle!\" repeated Orsini, with the doubtful expression of\none who is not quite certain whether he shall risk walking on thin ice,\nand decides to go softly: \"Snakes! Indeed they would rather be doves I\nwould call them.\"\n\nA kind laugh from Sybil strengthened into conviction his hope that\nhe had made a joke in this unknown tongue. His face brightened, his\nconfidence returned; once or twice he softly repeated to himself: \"Not\nsnakes; they would be doves!\" But Mrs. Lee's sensitive ear had caught\nSybil's remark, and detected in it a certain tone of condescension which\nwas not to her taste.\n\nThe impassive countenances of these bland young Secretaries of Legation\nseemed to acquiesce far too much as a matter of course in the idea\nthat there was no society except in the old world. She broke into the\nconversation with an emphasis that fluttered the dove-cote:\n\n\"Society in America? Indeed there is society in America, and very\ngood society too; but it has a code of its own, and new-comers seldom\nunderstand it. I will tell you what it is, Mr. Orsini, and you will\nnever be in danger of making any mistake. 'Society' in America means all\nthe honest, kindly-mannered, pleasant-voiced women, and all the good,\nbrave, unassuming men, between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Each\nof these has a free pass in every city and village, 'good for this\ngeneration only,' and it depends on each to make use of this pass or\nnot as it may happen to suit his or her fancy. To this rule there are\nno exceptions, and those who say 'Abraham is our father' will surely\nfurnish food for that humour which is the staple product of our\ncountry.\"\n\nThe alarmed youths, who did not in the least understand the meaning of\nthis demonstration, looked on with a feeble attempt at acquiescence,\nwhile Mrs.\n\nLee brandished her sugar-tongs in the act of transferring a lump of\nsugar to her cup, quite unconscious of the slight absurdity of the\ngesture, while Sybil stared in amazement, for it was not often that\nher sister waved the stars and stripes so energetically. Whatever their\nsilent criticisms might be, however, Mrs. Lee was too much in earnest to\nbe conscious of them, or, indeed, to care for anything but what she\nwas saying. There was a moment's pause when she came to the end of her\nspeech, and then the thread of talk was quietly taken up again where\nSybil's incipient sneer had broken it.\n\nCarrington came in. \"What have you been doing at the Capitol?\" asked\nMadeleine.\n\n\"Lobbying!\" was the reply, given in the semi-serious tone of\nCarrington's humour.\n\n\"So soon, and Congress only two days old?\" exclaimed Mrs. Lee.\n\n\"Madam,\" rejoined Carrington, with his quietest malice, \"Congressmen are\nlike birds of the air, which are caught only by the early worm.\" \"Good\nafternoon, Mrs. Lee. Miss Sybil, how do you do again? Which of these\ngentlemen's hearts are you feeding upon now?\" This was the refined style\nof Mr. French, indulging in what he was pleased to term \"badinaige.\" He,\ntoo, was on his way from the Capitol, and had come in for a cup of tea\nand a little human society. Sybil made a face which plainly expressed a\nlonging to inflict on Mr. French some grievous personal wrong, but she\npretended not to hear. He sat down by Madeleine, and asked, \"Did you see\nRatcliffe yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Madeleine; \"he was here last evening with Mr. Carrington and\none or two others.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything about politics?\"\n\n\"Not a word. We talked mostly about books.\"\n\n\"Books! What does he know about books?\"\n\n\"You must ask him.\"\n\n\"Well, this is the most ridiculous situation we are all in. No one\nknows anything about the new President. You could take your oath that\neverybody is in the dark. Ratcliffe says he knows as little as the rest\nof us, but it can't be true; he is too old a politician not to have\nwires in his hand; and only to-day one of the pages of the Senate told\nmy colleague Cutter that a letter sent off by him yesterday was directed\nto Sam Grimes, of North Bend, who, as every one knows, belongs to the\nPresident's particular crowd.--Why, Mr. Schneidekoupon! How do you do?\nWhen did you come on?\"\n\n\"Thank you; this morning,\" replied Mr. Schneidekoupon, just entering the\nroom. \"So glad to see you again, Mrs. Lee. How do you and your sister\nlike Washington? Do you know I have brought Julia on for a visit? I\nthought I should find her here.\n\n\"She has just gone. She has been all the afternoon with Sybil, making\ncalls. She says you want her here to lobby for you, Mr. Schneidekoupon.\nIs it true?\"\n\n\"So I did,\" replied he, with a laugh, \"but she is precious little use.\nSo I've come to draft you into the service.\"\n\n\"Me!\"\n\n\"Yes; you know we all expect Senator Ratcliffe to be Secretary of the\nTreasury, and it is very important for us to keep him straight on the\ncurrency and the tariff. So I have come on to establish more intimate\nrelations with him, as they say in diplomacy. I want to get him to dine\nwith me at Welckley's, but as I know he keeps very shy of politics I\nthought my only chance was to make it a ladies' dinner, so I brought on\nJulia. I shall try and get Mrs. Schuyler Clinton, and I depend upon you\nand your sister to help Julia out.\"\n\n\"Me! at a lobby dinner! Is that proper?\"\n\n\"Why not? You shall choose the guests.\"\n\n\"I never heard of such a thing; but it would certainly be amusing. Sybil\nmust not go, but I might.\" \"Excuse me; Julia depends upon Miss Ross, and\nwill not go to table without her.\"\n\n\"Well,\" assented Mrs. Lee, hesitatingly, \"perhaps if you get Mrs.\nClinton, and if your sister is there And who else?\"\n\n\"Choose your own company.\"\n\n\"I know no one.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; here is French, not quite sound on the tariff, but good for\nwhat we want just now. Then we can get Mr. Gore; he has his little\nhatchet to grind too, and will be glad to help grind ours. We only want\ntwo or three more, and I will have an extra man or so to fill up.\"\n\n\"Do ask the Speaker. I want to know him.\"\n\n\"I will, and Carrington, and my Pennsylvania Senator. That will do\nnobly. Remember, Welckley's, Saturday at seven.\"\n\nMeanwhile Sybil had been at the piano, and when she had sung for a time,\nOrsini was induced to take her place, and show that it was possible\nto sing without injury to one's beauty. Baron Jacobi came in and found\nfault with them both. Little Miss Dare--commonly known among her male\nfriends as little Daredevil--who was always absorbed in some flirtation\nwith a Secretary of Legation, came in, quite unaware that Popoff was\npresent, and retired with him into a corner, while Orsini and Jacobi\nbullied poor Sybil, and fought with each other at the piano; everybody\nwas talking with very little reference to any reply, when at last Mrs.\nLee drove them all out of the room: \"We are quiet people,\" said she,\n\"and we dine at half-past six.\"\n\nSenator Ratcliffe had not failed to make his Sunday evening call upon\nMrs.\n\nLee. Perhaps it was not strictly correct to say that they had talked\nbooks all the evening, but whatever the conversation was, it had\nonly confirmed Mr. Ratcliffe's admiration for Mrs. Lee, who, without\nintending to do so, had acted a more dangerous part than if she had been\nthe most accomplished of coquettes. Nothing could be more fascinating\nto the weary politician in his solitude than the repose of Mrs. Lee's\nparlour, and when Sybil sang for him one or two simple airs--she\nsaid they were foreign hymns, the Senator being, or being considered,\northodox--Mr. Ratcliffe's heart yearned toward the charming girl quite\nwith the sensations of a father, or even of an elder brother.\n\nHis brother senators very soon began to remark that the Prairie Giant\nhad acquired a trick of looking up to the ladies' gallery. One day Mr.\nJonathan Andrews, the special correspondent of the New York Sidereal\nSystem, a very friendly organ, approached Senator Schuyler Clinton with\na puzzled look on his face.\n\n\"Can you tell me,\" said he, \"what has happened to Silas P. Ratcliffe?\nOnly a moment ago I was talking with him at his seat on a very important\nsubject, about which I must send his opinions off to New York to-night,\nwhen, in the middle of a sentence, he stopped short, got up without\nlooking at me, and left the Senate Chamber, and now I see him in the\ngallery talking with a lady whose face I don't know.\"\n\nSenator Clinton slowly adjusted his gold eye-glasses and looked up at\nthe place indicated: \"Ah! Mrs. Lightfoot Lee! I think I will say a word\nto her myself;\" and turning his back on the special correspondent, he\nskipped away with youthful agility after the Senator from Illinois.\n\n\"Devil!\" muttered Mr. Andrews; \"what has got into the old fools?\" and in\na still less audible murmur as he looked up to Mrs. Lee, then in close\nconversation with Ratcliffe: \"Had I better make an item of that?\"\n\nWhen young Mr. Schneidekoupon called upon Senator Ratcliffe to invite\nhim to the dinner at Welckley's, he found that gentleman overwhelmed\nwith work, as he averred, and very little disposed to converse. No! he\ndid not now go out to dinner. In the present condition of the public\nbusiness he found it impossible to spare the time for such amusements.\nHe regretted to decline Mr. Schneidekoupon's civility, but there were\nimperative reasons why he should abstain for the present from social\nentertainments; he had made but one exception to his rule, and only at\nthe pressing request of his old friend Senator Clinton, and on a very\nspecial occasion.\n\nMr. Schneidekoupon was deeply vexed--the more, he said, because he had\nmeant to beg Mr. and Mrs. Clinton to be of the party, as well as a very\ncharming lady who rarely went into society, but who had almost consented\nto come.\n\n\"Who is that?\" inquired the Senator.\n\n\"A Mrs. Lightfoot Lee, of New York. Probably you do not know her well\nenough to admire her as I do; but I think her quite the most intelligent\nwoman I ever met.\"\n\nThe Senator's cold eyes rested for a moment on the young man's open face\nwith a peculiar expression of distrust. Then he solemnly said, in his\ndeepest senatorial tones:\n\n\"My young friend, at my time of life men have other things to occupy\nthem than women, however intelligent they may be. Who else is to be of\nyour party?\"\n\nMr. Schneidekoupon named his list.\n\n\"And for Saturday evening at seven, did you say?\"\n\n\"Saturday at seven.\"\n\n\"I fear there is little chance of my attending, but I will not\nabsolutely decline. Perhaps when the moment arrives, I may find myself\nable to be there. But do not count upon me--do not count upon me. Good\nday, Mr. Schneidekoupon.\"\n\nSchneidekoupon was rather a simple-minded young man, who saw no deeper\nthan his neighbours into the secrets of the universe, and he went off\nswearing roundly at \"the infernal airs these senators give themselves.\"\nHe told Mrs.\n\nLee all the conversation, as indeed he was compelled to do under penalty\nof bringing her to his party under false pretences.\n\n\"Just my luck,\" said he; \"here I am forced to ask no end of people to\nmeet a man, who at the same time says he shall probably not come. Why,\nunder the stars, couldn't he say, like other people, whether he was\ncoming or not? I've known dozens of senators, Mrs. Lee, and they're all\nlike that. They never think of any one but themselves.\"\n\nMrs. Lee smiled rather a forced smile, and soothed his wounded feelings;\nshe had no doubt the dinner would be very agreeable whether the Senator\nwere there or not; at any rate she would do all she could to carry it\noff well, and Sybil should wear her newest dress. Still she was a little\ngrave, and Mr. Schneidekoupon could only declare that she was a trump;\nthat he had told Ratcliffe she was the cleverest woman he ever met, and\nhe might have added the most obliging, and Ratcliffe had only looked\nat him as though he were a green ape. At all which Mrs. Lee laughed\ngood-naturedly, and sent him away as soon as she could.\n\nWhen he was gone, she walked up and down the room and thought. She saw\nthe meaning of Ratcliffe's sudden change in tone. She had no more doubt\nof his coming to the dinner than she had of the reason why he came.\nAnd was it possible that she was being drawn into something very near\na flirtation with a man twenty years her senior; a politician from\nIllinois; a huge, ponderous, grey-eyed, bald senator, with a Websterian\nhead, who lived in Peonia? The idea was almost too absurd to be\ncredited; but on the whole the thing itself was rather amusing. \"I\nsuppose senators can look out for themselves like other men,\" was her\nfinal conclusion. She thought only of his danger, and she felt a sort\nof compassion for him as she reflected on the possible consequences of a\ngreat, absorbing love at his time of life.\n\nHer conscience was a little uneasy; but of herself she never thought.\nYet it is a historical fact that elderly senators have had a curious\nfascination for young and handsome women. Had they looked out for\nthemselves too? And which parties most needed to be looked after?\n\nWhen Madeleine and her sister arrived at Welckley's 's the next Saturday\nevening, they found poor Schneidekoupon in a temper very unbecoming a\nhost.\n\n\"He won't come! I told you he wouldn't come!\" said he to Madeleine, as\nhe handed her into the house. \"If I ever turn communist, it will be for\nthe fun of murdering a senator.\"\n\nMadeleine consoled him gently, but he continued to use, behind Mr.\nClinton's back, language the most offensive and improper towards the\nSenate, and at last, ringing the bell, he sharply ordered the head\nwaiter to serve dinner.\n\nAt that very moment the door opened, and Senator Ratcliffe's stately\nfigure appeared on the threshold. His eye instantly caught Madeleine's,\nand she almost laughed aloud, for she saw that the Senator was dressed\nwith very unsenatorial neatness; that he had actually a flower in his\nburton-hole and no gloves!\n\nAfter the enthusiastic description which Schneidekoupon had given of\nMrs.\n\nLee's charms, he could do no less than ask Senator Ratcliffe to take her\nin to dinner, which he did without delay. Either this, or the champagne,\nor some occult influence, had an extraordinary effect upon him. He\nappeared ten years younger than usual; his face was illuminated; his\neyes glowed; he seemed bent on proving his kinship to the immortal\nWebster by rivalling his convivial powers. He dashed into the\nconversation; laughed, jested, and ridiculed; told stories in Yankee\nand Western dialect; gave sharp little sketches of amusing political\nexperiences.\n\n\"Never was more surprised in my life,\" whispered Senator Krebs, of\nPennsylvania, across the table to Schneidekoupon. \"Hadn't an idea that\nRatcliffe was so entertaining.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Clinton, who sat by Madeleine on the other side, whispered low\ninto her ear: \"I am afraid, my dear Mrs. Lee, that you are responsible\nfor this. He never talks so to the Senate.\"\n\nNay, he even rose to a higher flight, and told the story of President\nLincoln's death-bed with a degree of feeling that brought tears into\ntheir eyes. The other guests made no figure at all. The Speaker consumed\nhis solitary duck and his lonely champagne in a corner without giving a\nsign.\n\nEven Mr. Gore, who was not wont to hide his light under any kind of\nextinguisher, made no attempt to claim the floor, and applauded with\nenthusiasm the conversation of his opposite neighbour. Ill-natured\npeople might say that Mr. Gore saw in Senator Ratcliffe a possible\nSecretary of State; be this as it may, he certainly said to Mrs.\nClinton, in an aside that was perfectly audible to every one at the\ntable: \"How brilliant! what an original mind! what a sensation he would\nmake abroad!\" And it was quite true, apart from the mere momentary\neffect of dinner-table talk, that there was a certain bigness about\nthe man; a keen practical sagacity; a bold freedom of self-assertion; a\nbroad way of dealing with what he knew.\n\nCarrington was the only person at table who looked on with a perfectly\ncool head, and who criticised in a hostile spirit. Carrington's\nimpression of Ratcliffe was perhaps beginning to be warped by a shade\nof jealousy, for he was in a peculiarly bad temper this evening, and his\nirritation was not wholly concealed.\n\n\"If one only had any confidence in the man!\" he muttered to French, who\nsat by him.\n\nThis unlucky remark set French to thinking how he could draw\nRatcliffe out, and accordingly, with his usual happy manner, combining\nself-conceit and high principles, he began to attack the Senator with\nsome \"badinaige\" on the delicate subject of Civil Service Reform, a\nsubject almost as dangerous in political conversation at Washington as\nslavery itself in old days before the war. French was a reformer, and\nlost no occasion of impressing his views; but unluckily he was a very\nlight weight, and his manner was a little ridiculous, so that even Mrs.\nLee, who was herself a warm reformer, sometimes went over to the other\nside when he talked. No sooner had he now shot his little arrow at the\nSenator, than that astute man saw his opportunity, and promised himself\nthe pleasure of administering to Mr.\n\nFrench punishment such as he knew would delight the company. Reformer\nas Mrs. Lee was, and a little alarmed at the roughness of Ratcliffe's\ntreatment, she could not blame the Prairie Giant, as she ought, who,\nafter knocking poor French down, rolled him over and over in the mud.\n\n\"Are you financier enough, Mr. French, to know what are the most famous\nproducts of Connecticut?\"\n\nMr. French modestly suggested that he thought its statesmen best\nanswered that description.\n\n\"No, sir! even there you're wrong. The showmen beat you on your own\nground. But every child in the union knows that the most famous products\nof Connecticut are Yankee notions, nutmegs made of wood and clocks that\nwon't go. Now, your Civil Service Reform is just such another Yankee\nnotion; it's a wooden nutmeg; it's a clock with a show case and sham\nworks. And you know it! You are precisely the old-school Connecticut\npeddler. You have gone about peddling your wooden nutmegs until you have\ngot yourself into Congress, and now you pull them out of your pockets\nand not only want us to take them at your own price, but you lecture us\non our sins if we don't. Well! we don't mind your doing that at home.\nAbuse us as much as you like to your constituents. Get as many votes as\nyou can. But don't electioneer here, because we know you intimately, and\nwe've all been a little in the wooden nutmeg business ourselves.\"\n\nSenator Clinton and Senator Krebs chuckled high approval over this\npunishment of poor French, which was on the level of their idea of wit.\nThey were all in the nutmeg business, as Ratcliffe said. The victim\ntried to make head against them; he protested that his nutmegs were\ngenuine; he sold no goods that he did not guarantee; and that this\nparticular article was actually guaranteed by the national conventions\nof both political parties.\n\n\"Then what you want, Mr. French, is a common school education. You\nneed a little study of the alphabet. Or if you won't believe me, ask my\nbrother senators here what chance there is for your Reforms so long\nas the American citizen is what he is.\"\n\n\"You'll not get much comfort in my State, Mr. French,\" growled the\nsenator from Pennsylvania, with a sneer; \"suppose you come and try.\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" said the benevolent Mr. Schuyler Clinton, gleaming\nbenignantly through his gold spectacles; \"don't be too hard on French.\nHe means well. Perhaps he's not very wise, but he does good. I know more\nabout it than any of you, and I don't deny that the thing is all bad.\nOnly, as Mr. Ratcliffe says, the difficulty is in the people, not in us.\nGo to work on them, French, and let us alone.\"\n\nFrench repented of his attack, and contented himself by muttering to\nCarrington: \"What a set of damned old reprobates they are!\"\n\n\"They are right, though, in one thing,\" was Carrington's reply: \"their\nadvice is good. Never ask one of them to reform anything; if you do, you\nwill be reformed yourself.\"\n\nThe dinner ended as brilliantly as it began, and Schneidekoupon was\ndelighted with his success. He had made himself particularly agreeable\nto Sybil by confiding in her all his hopes and fears about the tariff\nand the finances. When the ladies left the table, Ratcliffe could not\nstay for a cigar; he must get back to his rooms, where he knew several\nmen were waiting for him; he would take his leave of the ladies and\nhurry away. But when the gentlemen came up nearly an hour afterwards\nthey found Ratcliffe still taking his leave of the ladies, who were\ndelighted at his entertaining conversation; and when at last he really\ndeparted, he said to Mrs. Lee, as though it were quite a matter of\ncourse: \"You are at home as usual to-morrow evening?\" Madeleine smiled,\nbowed, and he went his way.\n\nAs the two sisters drove home that night, Madeleine was unusually\nsilent.\n\nSybil yawned convulsively and then apologized:\n\n\"Mr. Schneidekoupon is very nice and good-natured, but a whole evening\nof him goes a long way; and that horrid Senator Krebs would not say a\nword, and drank a great deal too much wine, though it couldn't make him\nany more stupid than he is. I don't think I care for senators.\" Then,\nwearily, after a pause: \"Well, Maude, I do hope you've got what you\nwanted. I'm sure you must have had politics enough. Haven't you got to\nthe heart of your great American mystery yet?\"\n\n\"Pretty near it, I think,\" said Madeleine, half to herself.\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nSUNDAY evening was stormy, and some enthusiasm was required to make one\nface its perils for the sake of society. Nevertheless, a few intimates\nmade their appearance as usual at Mrs. Lee's. The faithful Popoff was\nthere, and Miss Dare also ran in to pass an hour with her dear Sybil;\nbut as she passed the whole evening in a corner with Popoff, she must\nhave been disappointed in her object. Carrington came, and Baron Jacobi.\nSchneidekoupon and his sister dined with Mrs. Lee, and remained after\ndinner, while Sybil and Julia Schneidekoupon compared conclusions about\nWashington society. The happy idea also occurred to Mr. Gore that,\ninasmuch as Mrs. Lee's house was but a step from his hotel, he might as\nwell take the chance of amusement there as the certainty of solitude\nin his rooms. Finally, Senator Ratcliffe duly made his appearance, and,\nhaving established himself with a cup of tea by Madeleine's side, was\nsoon left to enjoy a quiet talk with her, the rest of the party by\ncommon consent occupying themselves with each other. Under cover of\nthe murmur of conversation in the room, Mr. Ratcliffe quickly became\nconfidential.\n\n\"I came to suggest that, if you want to hear an interesting debate,\nyou should come up to the Senate to-morrow. I am told that Garrard, of\nLouisiana, means to attack my last speech, and I shall probably in that\ncase have to answer him. With you for a critic I shall speak better.\"\n\n\"Am I such an amiable critic?\" asked Madeleine.\n\n\"I never heard that amiable critics were the best,\" said he; \"justice is\nthe soul of good criticism, and it is only justice that I ask and expect\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"What good does this speaking do?\" inquired she. \"Are you any nearer the\nend of your difficulties by means of your speeches?\"\n\n\"I hardly know yet. Just now we are in dead water; but this can't last\nlong. In fact, I am not afraid to tell you, though of course you will\nnot repeat it to any human being, that we have taken measures to force\nan issue. Certain gentlemen, myself among the rest, have written letters\nmeant for the President's eye, though not addressed directly to him, and\nintended to draw out an expression of some sort that will show us what\nto expect.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" laughed Madeleine, \"I knew about that a week ago.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About your letter to Sam Grimes, of North Bend.\"\n\n\"What have you heard about my letter to Sam Grimes, of North Bend?\"\nejaculated Ratcliffe, a little abruptly.\n\n\"Oh, you do not know how admirably I have organised my secret service\nbureau,\" said she. \"Representative Cutter cross-questioned one of the\nSenate pages, and obliged him to confess that he had received from you a\nletter to be posted, which letter was addressed to Mr. Grimes, of North\nBend.\"\n\n\"And, of course, he told this to French, and French told you,\" said\nRatcliffe; \"I see. If I had known this I would not have let French off\nso gently last night, for I prefer to tell you my own story without his\nembellishments. But it was my fault. I should not have trusted a page.\nNothing is a secret here long. But one thing that Mr. Cutter did not\nfind out was that several other gentlemen wrote letters at the same\ntime, for the same purpose. Your friend, Mr. Clinton, wrote; Krebs\nwrote; and one or two members.\"\n\n\"I suppose I must not ask what you said?\"\n\n\"You may. We agreed that it was best to be very mild and conciliatory,\nand to urge the President only to give us some indication of his\nintentions, in order that we might not run counter to them. I drew a\nstrong picture of the effect of the present situation on the party, and\nhinted that I had no personal wishes to gratify.\"\n\n\"And what do you think will be the result?\"\n\n\"I think we shall somehow manage to straighten things out,\" said\nRatcliffe.\n\n\"The difficulty is only that the new President has little experience,\nand is suspicious. He thinks we shall intrigue to tie his hands, and he\nmeans to tie ours in advance. I don't know him personally, but those\nwho do, and who are fair judges, say that, though rather narrow and\nobstinate, he is honest enough, and will come round. I have no doubt\nI could settle it all with him in an hour's talk, but it is out of the\nquestion for me to go to him unless I am asked, and to ask me to come\nwould be itself a settlement.\"\n\n\"What, then, is the danger you fear?\"\n\n\"That he will offend all the important party leaders in order to\nconciliate unimportant ones, perhaps sentimental ones, like your friend\nFrench; that he will make foolish appointments without taking advice. By\nthe way, have you seen French to-day?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Madeleine; \"I think he must be sore at your treatment of\nhim last evening. You were very rude to him.\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Ratcliffe; \"these reformers need it. His attack on me\nwas meant for a challenge. I saw it in his manner.\n\n\"But is reform really so impossible as you describe it? Is it quite\nhopeless?\"\n\n\"Reform such as he wants is utterly hopeless, and not even desirable.\"\n\nMrs. Lee, with much earnestness of manner, still pressed her question:\n\n\"Surely something can be done to check corruption. Are we for ever to\nbe at the mercy of thieves and ruffians? Is a respectable government\nimpossible in a democracy?\"\n\nHer warmth attracted Jacobi's attention, and he spoke across the room.\n\"What is that you say, Mrs. Lee? What is it about corruption?\"\n\nAll the gentlemen began to listen and gather about them.\n\n\"I am asking Senator Ratcliffe,\" said she, \"what is to become of us if\ncorruption is allowed to go unchecked.\"\n\n\"And may I venture to ask permission to hear Mr. Ratcliffe's reply?\"\nasked the baron.\n\n\"My reply,\" said Ratcliffe, \"is that no representative government can\nlong be much better or much worse than the society it represents. Purify\nsociety and you purify the government. But try to purify the government\nartificially and you only aggravate failure.\"\n\n\"A very statesmanlike reply,\" said Baron Jacobi, with a formal bow, but\nhis tone had a shade of mockery. Carrington, who had listened with\na darkening face, suddenly turned to the baron and asked him what\nconclusion he drew from the reply.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the baron, with his wickedest leer, \"what for is my\nconclusion good? You Americans believe yourselves to be excepted from\nthe operation of general laws. You care not for experience. I have lived\nseventy-five years, and all that time in the midst of corruption. I am\ncorrupt myself, only I do have courage to proclaim it, and you others\nhave it not. Rome, Paris, Vienna, Petersburg, London, all are corrupt;\nonly Washington is pure! Well, I declare to you that in all my\nexperience I have found no society which has had elements of corruption\nlike the United States. The children in the street are corrupt, and know\nhow to cheat me. The cities are all corrupt, and also the towns and the\ncounties and the States' legislatures and the judges. Everywhere men\nbetray trusts both public and private, steal money, run away with public\nfunds. Only in the Senate men take no money. And you gentlemen in the\nSenate very well declare that your great United States, which is the\nhead of the civilized world, can never learn anything from the example\nof corrupt Europe. You are right--quite right! The great United States\nneeds not an example. I do much regret that I have not yet one hundred\nyears to live. If I could then come back to this city, I should find\nmyself very content--much more than now. I am always content where there\nis much corruption, and ma parole d'honneur!\" broke out the old man with\nfire and gesture, \"the United States will then be more corrupt than Rome\nunder Caligula; more corrupt than the Church under Leo X.; more corrupt\nthan France under the Regent!\"\n\nAs the baron closed his little harangue, which he delivered directly at\nthe senator sitting underneath him, he had the satisfaction to see that\nevery one was silent and listening with deep attention. He seemed to\nenjoy annoying the senator, and he had the satisfaction of seeing that\nthe senator was visibly annoyed. Ratcliffe looked sternly at the baron\nand said, with some curtness, that he saw no reason to accept such\nconclusions.\n\nConversation flagged, and all except the baron were relieved when Sybil,\nat Schneidekoupon's request, sat down at the piano to sing what she\ncalled a hymn. So soon as the song was over, Ratcliffe, who seemed to\nhave been curiously thrown off his balance by Jacobi's harangue, pleaded\nurgent duties at his rooms, and retired. The others soon afterwards went\noff in a body, leaving only Carrington and Gore, who had seated himself\nby Madeleine, and was at once dragged by her into a discussion of the\nsubject which perplexed her, and for the moment threw over her mind a\nnet of irresistible fascination.\n\n\"The baron discomfited the senator,\" said Gore, with a certain\nhesitation.\n\n\"Why did Ratcliffe let himself be trampled upon in that manner?\"\n\n\"I wish you would explain why,\" replied Mrs. Lee; \"tell me,\nMr. Gore--you who represent cultivation and literary taste\nhereabouts--please tell me what to think about Baron Jacobi's speech.\nWho and what is to be believed? Mr. Ratcliffe seems honest and wise. Is\nhe a corruptionist? He believes in the people, or says he does. Is he\ntelling the truth or not?\"\n\nGore was too experienced in politics to be caught in such a trap as\nthis. He evaded the question. \"Mr. Ratcliffe has a practical piece of\nwork to do; his business is to make laws and advise the President;\nhe does it extremely well. We have no other equally good practical\npolitician; it is unfair to require him to be a crusader besides.\"\n\n\"No!\" interposed Carrington, curtly; \"but he need not obstruct crusades.\nHe need not talk virtue and oppose the punishment of vice.\"\n\n\"He is a shrewd practical politician,\" replied Gore, \"and he feels first\nthe weak side of any proposed political tactics.\"\n\nWith a sigh of despair Madeleine went on: \"Who, then, is right? How can\nwe all be right? Half of our wise men declare that the world is going\nstraight to perdition; the other half that it is fast becoming perfect.\nBoth cannot be right. There is only one thing in life,\" she went on,\nlaughing, \"that I must and will have before I die. I must know whether\nAmerica is right or wrong. Just now this question is a very practical\none, for I really want to know whether to believe in Mr. Ratcliffe. If I\nthrow him overboard, everything must go, for he is only a specimen.\"\n\n\"Why not believe in Mr. Ratcliffe?\" said Gore; \"I believe in him myself,\nand am not afraid to say so.\"\n\nCarrington, to whom Ratcliffe now began to represent the spirit of evil,\ninterposed here, and observed that he imagined Mr. Gore had other\nguides besides, and steadier ones than Ratcliffe, to believe in; while\nMadeleine, with a certain feminine perspicacity, struck at a much weaker\npoint in Mr.\n\nGore's armour, and asked point-blank whether he believed also in\nwhat Ratcliffe represented: \"Do you yourself think democracy the best\ngovernment, and universal suffrage a success?\"\n\nMr. Gore saw himself pinned to the wall, and he turned at bay with\nalmost the energy of despair:\n\n\"These are matters about which I rarely talk in society; they are like\nthe doctrine of a personal God; of a future life; of revealed religion;\nsubjects which one naturally reserves for private reflection. But since\nyou ask for my political creed, you shall have it. I only condition that\nit shall be for you alone, never to be repeated or quoted as mine. I\nbelieve in democracy. I accept it. I will faithfully serve and defend\nit. I believe in it because it appears to me the inevitable consequence\nof what has gone before it. Democracy asserts the fact that the masses\nare now raised to a higher intelligence than formerly. All our\ncivilisation aims at this mark. We want to do what we can to help it. I\nmyself want to see the result. I grant it is an experiment, but it is\nthe only direction society can take that is worth its taking; the only\nconception of its duty large enough to satisfy its instincts; the only\nresult that is worth an effort or a risk. Every other possible step is\nbackward, and I do not care to repeat the past. I am glad to see society\ngrapple with issues in which no one can afford to be neutral.\"\n\n\"And supposing your experiment fails,\" said Mrs. Lee; \"suppose society\ndestroys itself with universal suffrage, corruption, and communism.\"\n\n\"I wish, Mrs. Lee, you would visit the Observatory with me some evening,\nand look at Sirius. Did you ever make the acquaintance of a fixed star?\nI believe astronomers reckon about twenty millions of them in sight, and\nan infinite possibility of invisible millions, each one of which is a\nsun, like ours, and may have satellites like our planet. Suppose you see\none of these fixed stars suddenly increase in brightness, and are\ntold that a satellite has fallen into it and is burning up, its career\nfinished, its capacities exhausted? Curious, is it not; but what does it\nmatter? Just as much as the burning up of a moth at your candle.\"\n\nMadeleine shuddered a little. \"I cannot get to the height of your\nphilosophy,\" said she. \"You are wandering among the infinites, and I am\nfinite.\"\n\n\"Not at all! But I have faith; not perhaps in the old dogmas, but in the\nnew ones; faith in human nature; faith in science; faith in the survival\nof the fittest. Let us be true to our time, Mrs. Lee! If our age is to\nbe beaten, let us die in the ranks. If it is to be victorious, let us be\nfirst to lead the column. Anyway, let us not be skulkers or grumblers.\nThere! have I repeated my catechism correctly? You would have it! Now\noblige me by forgetting it. I should lose my character at home if it got\nout. Good night!\"\n\nMrs. Lee duly appeared at the Capitol the next day, as she could not but\ndo after Senator Ratcliffe's pointed request. She went alone, for Sybil\nhad positively refused to go near the Capitol again, and Madeleine\nthought that on the whole this was not an occasion for enrolling\nCarrington in her service. But Ratcliffe did not speak. The debate was\nunexpectedly postponed.\n\nHe joined Mrs. Lee in the gallery, however, sat with her as long as she\nwould allow, and became still more confidential, telling her that he had\nreceived the expected reply from Grimes, of North Bend, and that it had\nenclosed a letter written by the President-elect to Mr. Grimes in regard\nto the advances made by Mr. Ratcliffe and his friends.\n\n\"It is not a handsome letter,\" said he; \"indeed, a part of it is\npositively insulting. I would like to read you one extract from it, and\nhear your opinion as to how it should be treated.\" Taking the letter\nfrom his pocket, he sought out the passage, and read as follows: \"'I\ncannot lose sight, too, of the consideration that these three Senators'\n(he means Clinton, Krebs, and me) are popularly considered to be the\nmost influential members of that so-called senatorial ring, which has\nacquired such general notoriety. While I shall always receive their\ncommunications with all due respect, I must continue to exercise\ncomplete freedom of action in consulting other political advisers as\nwell as these, and I must in all cases make it my first object to follow\nthe wishes of the people, not always most truly represented by their\nnominal representatives.' What say you to that precious piece of\npresidential manners?\"\n\n\"At least I like his courage,\" said Mrs. Lee.\n\n\"Courage is one thing; common sense is another. This letter is a studied\ninsult. He has knocked me off the track once. He means to do it again.\nIt is a declaration of war. What ought I to do?\"\n\n\"Whatever is most for the public good.\" said Madeleine, gravely.\n\nRatcliffe looked into her face with such undisguised delight--there was\nso little possibility of mistaking or ignoring the expression of his\neyes, that she shrank back with a certain shock. She was not prepared\nfor so open a demonstration. He hardened his features at once, and went\non:\n\n\"But what is most for the public good?\"\n\n\"That you know better than I,\" said Madeleine; \"only one thing is clear\nto me. If you let yourself be ruled by your private feelings, you will\nmake a greater mistake than he. Now I must go, for I have visits to\nmake. The next time I come, Mr. Ratcliffe, you must keep your word\nbetter.\"\n\nWhen they next met, Ratcliffe read to her a part of his reply to Mr.\nGrimes, which ran thus: \"It is the lot of every party leader to suffer\nfrom attacks and to commit errors. It is true, as the President says,\nthat I have been no exception to this law. Believing as I do that great\nresults can only be accomplished by great parties, I have uniformly\nyielded my own personal opinions where they have failed to obtain\ngeneral assent. I shall continue to follow this course, and the\nPresident may with perfect confidence count upon my disinterested\nsupport of all party measures, even though I may not be consulted in\noriginating them.\"\n\nMrs. Lee listened attentively, and then said: \"Have you never refused to\ngo with your party?\"\n\n\"Never!\" was Ratcliffe's firm reply.\n\nMadeleine still more thoughtfully inquired again: \"Is nothing more\npowerful than party allegiance?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except national allegiance,\" replied Ratcliffe, still more\nfirmly.\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nTO tie a prominent statesman to her train and to lead him about like a\ntame bear, is for a young and vivacious woman a more certain amusement\nthan to tie herself to him and to be dragged about like an Indian\nsquaw. This fact was Madeleine Lee's first great political discovery in\nWashington, and it was worth to her all the German philosophy she had\never read, with even a complete edition of Herbert Spencer's works into\nthe bargain. There could be no doubt that the honours and dignities of\na public career were no fair consideration for its pains. She made a\nlittle daily task for herself of reading in succession the lives and\nletters of the American Presidents, and of their wives, when she could\nfind that there was a trace of the latter's existence. What a melancholy\nspectacle it was, from George Washington down to the last incumbent;\nwhat vexations, what disappointments, what grievous mistakes, what very\nobjectionable manners! Not one of them, who had aimed at high purpose,\nbut had been thwarted, beaten, and habitually insulted! What a gloom lay\non the features of those famous chieftains, Calhoun, Clay, and Webster;\nwhat varied expression of defeat and unsatisfied desire; what a sense\nof self-importance and senatorial magniloquence; what a craving for\nflattery; what despair at the sentence of fate! And what did they amount\nto, after all?\n\nThey were practical men, these! they had no great problems of thought to\nsettle, no questions that rose above the ordinary rules of common\nmorals and homely duty. How they had managed to befog the subject!\nWhat elaborate show-structures they had built up, with no result but\nto obscure the horizon! Would not the country have done better without\nthem? Could it have done worse? What deeper abyss could have opened\nunder the nation's feet, than that to whose verge they brought it?\n\nMadeleine's mind wearied with the monotony of the story. She discussed\nthe subject with Ratcliffe, who told her frankly that the pleasure of\npolitics lay in the possession of power. He agreed that the country\nwould do very well without him. \"But here I am,\" said he, \"and here I\nmean to stay.\" He had very little sympathy for thin moralising, and a\nstatesmanlike contempt for philosophical politics. He loved power, and\nhe meant to be President.\n\nThat was enough.\n\nSometimes the tragic and sometimes the comic side was uppermost in her\nmind, and sometimes she did not herself know whether to cry or to laugh.\n\nWashington more than any other city in the world swarms with\nsimple-minded exhibitions of human nature; men and women curiously out\nof place, whom it would be cruel to ridicule and ridiculous to weep\nover. The sadder exhibitions are fortunately seldom seen by respectable\npeople; only the little social accidents come under their eyes. One\nevening Mrs. Lee went to the President's first evening reception. As\nSybil flatly refused to face the crowd, and Carrington mildly said that\nhe feared he was not sufficiently reconstructed to appear at home in\nthat august presence, Mrs. Lee accepted Mr. French for an escort, and\nwalked across the Square with him to join the throng that was pouring\ninto the doors of the White House. They took their places in the line\nof citizens and were at last able to enter the reception-room. There\nMadeleine found herself before two seemingly mechanical figures, which\nmight be wood or wax, for any sign they showed of life. These two\nfigures were the President and his wife; they stood stiff and awkward by\nthe door, both their faces stripped of every sign of intelligence, while\nthe right hands of both extended themselves to the column of visitors\nwith the mechanical action of toy dolls. Mrs. Lee for a moment began\nto laugh, but the laugh died on her lips. To the President and his\nwife this was clearly no laughing matter. There they stood, automata,\nrepresentatives of the society which streamed past them. Madeleine\nseized Mr. French by the arm.\n\n\"Take me somewhere at once,\" said she, \"where I can look at it. Here! in\nthe corner. I had no conception how shocking it was!\"\n\nMr. French supposed she was thinking of the queer-looking men and women\nwho were swarming through the rooms, and he made, after his own delicate\nnotion of humour, some uncouth jests on those who passed by. Mrs. Lee,\nhowever, was in no humour to explain or even to listen. She stopped him\nshort:--\n\n\"There, Mr. French! Now go away and leave me. I want to be alone for\nhalf an hour. Please come for me then.\" And there she stood, with her\neyes fixed on the President and his wife, while the endless stream of\nhumanity passed them, shaking hands.\n\nWhat a strange and solemn spectacle it was, and how the deadly\nfascination of it burned the image in upon her mind! What a horrid\nwarning to ambition!\n\nAnd in all that crowd there was no one besides herself who felt the\nmockery of this exhibition. To all the others this task was a regular\npart of the President's duty, and there was nothing ridiculous about\nit. They thought it a democratic institution, this droll a ping of\nmonarchical forms. To them the deadly dulness of the show was as natural\nand proper as ever to the courtiers of the Philips and Charleses seemed\nthe ceremonies of the Escurial. To her it had the effect of a nightmare,\nor of an opium-eater's vision, She felt a sudden conviction that this\nwas to be the end of American society; its realisation and dream at\nonce. She groaned in spirit.\n\n\"Yes! at last I have reached the end! We shall grow to be wax images,\nand our talk will be like the squeaking of toy dolls. We shall all\nwander round and round the earth and shake hands. No one will have\nany object in this world, and there will be no other. It is worse than\nanything in the 'Inferno.' What an awful vision of eternity!\"\n\nSuddenly, as through a mist, she saw the melancholy face of Lord Skye\napproaching. He came to her side, and his voice recalled her to reality.\n\n\"Does it amuse you, this sort of thing?\" he asked in a vague way.\n\n\"We take our amusement sadly, after the manner of our people,\" she\nreplied; \"but it certainly interests me.\"\n\nThey stood for a time in silence, watching the slowly eddying dance of\nDemocracy, until he resumed:\n\n\"Whom do you take that man to be--the long, lean one, with a long woman\non each arm?\"\n\n\"That man,\" she replied, \"I take to be a Washington department-clerk, or\nperhaps a member of Congress from Iowa, with a wife and wife's sister.\nDo they shock your nobility?\"\n\nHe looked at her with comical resignation. \"You mean to tell me\nthat they are quite as good as dowager-countesses. I grant it. My\naristocratic spirit is broken, Mrs. Lee. I will even ask them to dinner\nif you bid me, and if you will come to meet them. But the last time I\nasked a member of Congress to dine, he sent me back a note in pencil on\nmy own envelope that he would bring two of his friends with him, very\nrespectable constituents from Yahoo city, or some such place; nature's\nnoblemen, he said.\"\n\n\"You should have welcomed them.\"\n\n\"I did. I wanted to see two of nature's noblemen, and I knew they would\nprobably be pleasanter company than their representative. They came;\nvery respectable persons, one with a blue necktie, the other with a red\none: both had diamond pins in their shirts, and were carefully brushed\nin respect to their hair. They said nothing, ate little, drank less,\nand were much better behaved than I am. When they went away, they\nunanimously asked me to stay with them when I visited Yahoo city.\"\n\n\"You will not want guests if you always do that.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think it was pure ignorance on their part. They knew\nno better, and they seemed modest enough. My only complaint was that I\ncould get nothing out of them. I wonder whether their wives would have\nbeen more amusing.\"\n\n\"Would they be so in England, Lord Skye?\"\n\nHe looked down at her with half-shut eyes, and drawled: \"You know my\ncountrywomen?\"\n\n\"Hardly at all.\"\n\n\"Then let us discuss some less serious subject.\"\n\n\"Willingly. I have waited for you to explain to me why you have to-night\nan expression of such melancholy.\"\n\n\"Is that quite friendly, Mrs. Lee? Do I really look melancholy?\"\n\n\"Unutterably, as I feel. I am consumed with curiosity to know the\nreason.\"\n\nThe British minister coolly took a complete survey of the whole room,\nending with a prolonged stare at the President and his wife, who were\nstill mechanically shaking hands; then he looked back into her face, and\nsaid never a word.\n\nShe insisted: \"I must have this riddle answered. It suffocates me. I\nshould not be sad at seeing these same people at work or at play, if\nthey ever do play; or in a church or a lecture-room. Why do they weigh\non me like a horrid phantom here?\"\n\n\"I see no riddle, Mrs. Lee. You have answered your own question; they\nare neither at work nor at play.\"\n\n\"Then please take me home at once. I shall have hysterics. The sight of\nthose two suffering images at the door is too mournful to be borne. I am\ndizzy with looking at these stalking figures. I don't believe they're\nreal. I wish the house would take fire. I want an earthquake. I wish\nsome one would pinch the President, or pull his wife's hair.\"\n\nMrs. Lee did not repeat the experiment of visiting the White House, and\nindeed for some time afterwards she spoke with little enthusiasm of the\npresidential office. To Senator Ratcliffe she expressed her opinions\nstrongly. The Senator tried in vain to argue that the people had a right\nto call upon their chief magistrate, and that he was bound to receive\nthem; this being so, there was no less objectionable way of proceeding\nthan the one which had been chosen. \"Who gave the people any such\nright?\" asked Mrs. Lee. \"Where does it come from? What do they want it\nfor? You know better, Mr. Ratcliffe! Our chief magistrate is a citizen\nlike any one else. What puts it into his foolish head to cease being a\ncitizen and to ape royalty? Our governors never make themselves\nridiculous. Why cannot the wretched being content himself with living\nlike the rest of us, and minding his own business? Does he know what a\nfigure of fun he is?\" And Mrs. Lee went so far as to declare that she\nwould like to be the President's wife only to put an end to this folly;\nnothing should ever induce her to go through such a performance; and if\nthe public did not approve of this, Congress might impeach her, and\nremove her from office; all she demanded was the right to be heard\nbefore the Senate in her own defence.\n\nNevertheless, there was a very general impression in Washington that\nMrs.\n\nLee would like nothing better than to be in the White House. Known\nto comparatively few people, and rarely discussing even with them the\nsubjects which deeply interested her, Madeleine passed for a clever,\nintriguing woman who had her own objects to gain. True it is, beyond\nperadventure, that all residents of Washington may be assumed to be in\noffice or candidates for office; unless they avow their object, they are\nguilty of an attempt--and a stupid one--to deceive; yet there is a small\nclass of apparent exceptions destined at last to fall within the rule.\nMrs. Lee was properly assumed to be a candidate for office. To the\nWashingtonians it was a matter of course that Mrs. Lee should marry\nSilas P. Ratcliffe. That he should be glad to get a fashionable and\nintelligent wife, with twenty or thirty thousand dollars a year, was not\nsurprising. That she should accept the first public man of the day, with\na flattering chance for the Presidency--a man still comparatively\nyoung and not without good looks--was perfectly natural, and in her\nundertaking she had the sympathy of all well-regulated Washington women\nwho were not possible rivals; for to them the President's wife is of\nmore consequence than the President; and, indeed, if America only knew\nit, they are not very far from the truth.\n\nSome there were, however, who did not assent to this good-natured though\nworldly view of the proposed match. These ladies were severe in their\ncomments upon Mrs. Lee's conduct, and did not hesitate to declare their\nopinion that she was the calmest and most ambitious minx who had ever\ncome within their observation. Unfortunately it happened that the\nrespectable and proper Mrs. Schuyler Clinton took this view of the case,\nand made little attempt to conceal her opinion. She was justly indignant\nat her cousin's gross worldliness, and possible promotion in rank.\n\n\"If Madeleine Ross marries that coarse, horrid old Illinois politician,\"\nsaid she to her husband, \"I never will forgive her so long as I live.\"\n\nMr. Clinton tried to excuse Madeleine, and even went so far as to\nsuggest that the difference of age was no greater than in their own\ncase; but his wife trampled ruthlessly on his argument.\n\n\"At any rate,\" said she, \"I never came to Washington as a widow on\npurpose to set my cap for the first candidate for the Presidency, and\nI never made a public spectacle of my indecent eagerness in the very\ngalleries of the Senate; and Mrs. Lee ought to be ashamed of herself.\nShe is a cold-blooded, heartless, unfeminine cat.\"\n\nLittle Victoria Dare, who babbled like the winds and streams, with utter\nindifference as to what she said or whom she addressed, used to bring\nchoice bits of this gossip to Mrs. Lee. She always affected a little\nstammer when she said anything uncommonly impudent, and put on a manner\nof languid simplicity. She felt keenly the satisfaction of seeing\nMadeleine charged with her own besetting sins. For years all Washington\nhad agreed that Victoria was little better than one of the wicked; she\nhad done nothing but violate every rule of propriety and scandalise\nevery well-regulated family in the city, and there was no good in her.\nYet it could not be denied that Victoria was amusing, and had a sort of\nirregular fascination; consequently she was universally tolerated. To\nsee Mrs. Lee thrust down to her own level was an unmixed pleasure to\nher, and she carefully repeated to Madeleine the choice bits of dialogue\nwhich she picked up in her wanderings.\n\n\"Your cousin, Mrs. Clinton, says you are a ca-ca-cat, Mrs. Lee.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it, Victoria. Mrs. Clinton never said anything of the\nsort.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Marston says it is because you have caught a ra-ra-rat, and\nSenator Clinton was only a m-m-mouse!\"\n\nNaturally all this unexpected publicity irritated Mrs. Lee not a little,\nespecially when short and vague paragraphs, soon followed by longer\nand more positive ones, in regard to Senator Ratcliffe's matrimonial\nprospects, began to appear in newspapers, along with descriptions of\nherself from the pens of enterprising female correspondents for the\npress, who had never so much as seen her. At the first sight of one of\nthese newspaper articles, Madeleine fairly cried with mortification and\nanger. She wanted to leave Washington the next day, and she hated the\nvery thought of Ratcliffe. There was something in the newspaper style so\ninscrutably vulgar, something so inexplicably revolting to the sense of\nfeminine decency, that she shrank under it as though it were a poisonous\nspider. But after the first acute shame had passed, her temper was\nroused, and she vowed that she would pursue her own path just as she\nhad begun, without regard to all the malignity and vulgarity in the wide\nUnited States. She did not care to marry Senator Ratcliffe; she liked\nhis society and was flattered by his confidence; she rather hoped to\nprevent him from ever making a formal offer, and if not, she would at\nleast push it off to the last possible moment; but she was not to be\nfrightened from marrying him by any amount of spitefulness or gossip,\nand she did not mean to refuse him except for stronger reasons than\nthese. She even went so far in her desperate courage as to laugh at her\ncousin, Mrs.\n\nClinton, whose venerable husband she allowed and even encouraged to pay\nher such public attention and to express sentiments of such youthful\nardour as she well knew would inflame and exasperate the excellent lady\nhis wife.\n\nCarrington was the person most unpleasantly affected by the course which\nthis affair had taken. He could no longer conceal from himself the fact\nthat he was as much m love as a dignified Virginian could be. With\nhim, at all events, she had shown no coquetry, nor had she ever either\nflattered or encouraged him. But Carrington, m his solitary struggle\nagainst fate, had found her a warm friend; always ready to assist where\nassistance was needed, generous with her money in any cause which he\nwas willing to vouch for, full of sympathy where sympathy was more than\nmoney, and full of resource and suggestion where money and sympathy\nfailed. Carrington knew her better than she knew herself. He selected\nher books; he brought the last speech or the last report from the\nCapitol or the departments; he knew her doubts and her vagaries, and as\nfar as he understood them at all, helped her to solve them.\n\nCarrington was too modest, and perhaps too shy, to act the part of a\ndeclared lover, and he was too proud to let it be thought that he wanted\nto exchange his poverty for her wealth. But he was all the more anxious\nwhen he saw the evident attraction which Ratcliffe's strong will and\nunscrupulous energy exercised over her. He saw that Ratcliffe was\nsteadily pushing his advances; that he flattered all Mrs. Lee's\nweaknesses by the confidence and deference with which he treated her;\nand that in a very short time, Madeleine must either marry him or find\nherself looked upon as a heartless coquette. He had his own reasons for\nthinking ill of Senator Ratcliffe, and he meant to prevent a marriage;\nbut he had an enemy to deal with not easily driven from the path, and\nquite capable of routing any number of rivals.\n\nRatcliffe was afraid of no one. He had not fought his own way in\nlife for nothing, and he knew all the value of a cold head and dogged\nself-assurance.\n\nNothing but this robust Americanism and his strong will carried him\nsafely through the snares and pitfalls of Mrs. Lee's society, where\nrivals and enemies beset him on every hand. He was little better than a\nschoolboy, when he ventured on their ground, but when he could draw\nthem over upon his own territory of practical life he rarely failed to\ntrample on his assailants.\n\nIt was this practical sense and cool will that won over Mrs. Lee, who\nwas woman enough to assume that all the graces were well enough\nemployed in decorating her, and it was enough if the other sex felt her\nsuperiority. Men were valuable only in proportion to their strength and\ntheir appreciation of women. If the senator had only been strong enough\nalways to control his temper, he would have done very well, but his\ntemper was under a great strain in these times, and his incessant effort\nto control it in politics made him less watchful in private life.\nMrs. Lee's tacit assumption of superior refinement irritated him,\nand sometimes made him show his teeth like a bull-dog, at the cost of\nreceiving from Mrs. Lee a quick stroke in return such as a well-bred\ntortoise-shell cat administers to check over-familiarity; innocent to\nthe eye, but drawing blood. One evening when he was more than commonly\nout of sorts, after sitting some time in moody silence, he roused\nhimself, and, taking up a book that lay on her table, he glanced at its\ntitle and turned over the leaves. It happened by ill luck to be a volume\nof Darwin that Mrs. Lee had just borrowed from the library of Congress.\n\n\"Do you understand this sort of thing?\" asked the Senator abruptly, in a\ntone that suggested a sneer.\n\n\"Not very well,\" replied Mrs. Lee, rather curtly.\n\n\"Why do you want to understand it?\" persisted the Senator. \"What good\nwill it do you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will teach us to be modest,\" answered Madeleine, quite equal\nto the occasion.\n\n\"Because it says we descend from monkeys?\" rejoined the Senator,\nroughly.\n\n\"Do you think you are descended from monkeys?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Madeleine.\n\n\"Why not?\" repeated Ratcliffe, laughing harshly. \"I don't like the\nconnection. Do you mean to introduce your distant relations into\nsociety?\"\n\n\"They would bring more amusement into it than most of its present\nmembers,\" rejoined Mrs. Lee, with a gentle smile that threatened\nmischief. But Ratcliffe would not be warned; on the contrary, the only\neffect of Mrs. Lee's defiance was to exasperate his ill-temper, and\nwhenever he lost his temper he became senatorial and Websterian. \"Such\nbooks,\" he began, \"disgrace our civilization; they degrade and stultify\nour divine nature; they are only suited for Asiatic despotisms where men\nare reduced to the level of brutes; that they should be accepted by a\nman like Baron Jacobi, I can understand; he and his masters have nothing\nto do in the world but to trample on human rights. Mr. Carrington, of\ncourse, would approve those ideas; he believes in the divine doctrine\nof flogging negroes; but that you, who profess philanthropy and free\nprinciples, should go with them, is astonishing; it is incredible; it is\nunworthy of you.\"\n\n\"You are very hard on the monkeys,\" replied Madeleine, rather sternly,\nwhen the Senator's oration was ended. \"The monkeys never did you any\nharm; they are not in public life; they are not even voters; if they\nwere, you would be enthusiastic about their intelligence and virtue.\nAfter all, we ought to be grateful to them, for what would men do\nin this melancholy world if they had not inherited gaiety from the\nmonkeys--as well as oratory.\"\n\nRatcliffe, to do him justice, took punishment well, at least when\nit came from Mrs. Lee's hands, and his occasional outbursts of\ninsubordination were sure to be followed by improved discipline; but if\nhe allowed Mrs. Lee to correct his faults, he had no notion of letting\nhimself be instructed by her friends, and he lost no chance of telling\nthem so. But to do this was not always enough. Whether it were that he\nhad few ideas outside of his own experience, or that he would not\ntrust himself on doubtful ground, he seemed compelled to bring every\ndiscussion down to his own level. Madeleine puzzled herself in vain to\nfind out whether he did this because he knew no better, or because he\nmeant to cover his own ignorance.\n\n\"The Baron has amused me very much with his account of Bucharest\nsociety,\" Mrs. Lee would say: \"I had no idea it was so gay.\"\n\n\"I would like to show him our society in Peonia,\" was Ratcliffe's reply;\n\"he would find a very brilliant circle there of nature's true noblemen.\"\n\n\"The Baron says their politicians are precious sharp chaps,\" added Mr.\n\nFrench.\n\n\"Oh, there are politicians in Bulgaria, are there?\" asked the Senator,\nwhose ideas of the Roumanian and Bulgarian neighbourhood were vague,\nand who had a general notion that all such people lived in tents,\nwore sheepskins with the wool inside, and ate curds: \"Oh, they have\npoliticians there! I would like to see them try their sharpness in the\nwest.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Mrs. Lee. \"Think of Attila and his hordes running an\nIndiana caucus?\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" cried French with a loud laugh, \"the Baron said that a set of\nbigger political scoundrels than his friends couldn't be found in all\nIllinois.\"\n\n\"Did he say that?\" exclaimed Ratcliffe angrily.\n\n\"Didn't he, Mrs. Lee? but I don't believe it; do you? What's your candid\nopinion, Ratcliffe? What you don't know about Illinois politics isn't\nworth knowing; do you really think those Bulgrascals couldn't run an\nIllinois state convention?\"\n\nRatcliffe did not like to be chaffed, especially on this subject, but he\ncould not resent French's liberty which was only a moderate return\nfor the wooden nutmeg. To get the conversation away from Europe, from\nliterature, from art, was his great object, and chaff was a way of\nescape.\n\nCarrington was very well aware that the weak side of the Senator lay in\nhis blind ignorance of morals. He flattered himself that Mrs. Lee must\nsee this and be shocked by it sooner or later, so that nothing more was\nnecessary than to let Ratcliffe expose himself. Without talking very\nmuch, Carrington always aimed at drawing him out. He soon found,\nhowever, that Ratcliffe understood such tactics perfectly, and instead\nof injuring, he rather improved his position. At times the man's\naudacity was startling, and even when Carrington thought him hopelessly\nentangled, he would sweep away all the hunter's nets with a sheer effort\nof strength, and walk off bolder and more dangerous than ever.\n\nWhen Mrs. Lee pressed him too closely, he frankly admitted her charges.\n\n\"What you say is in great part true. There is much in politics that\ndisgusts and disheartens; much that is coarse and bad. I grant you there\nis dishonesty and corruption. We must try to make the amount as small as\npossible.\"\n\n\"You should be able to tell Mrs. Lee how she must go to work,\" said\nCarrington; \"you have had experience. I have heard, it seems to me, that\nyou were once driven to very hard measures against corruption.\"\n\nRatcliffe looked ill-pleased at this compliment, and gave Carrington one\nof his cold glances that meant mischief. But he took up the challenge on\nthe spot:--\n\n\"Yes, I was, and am very sorry for it. The story is this, Mrs. Lee;\nand it is well-known to every man, woman, and child in the State of\nIllinois, so that I have no reason for softening it. In the worst days\nof the war there was almost a certainty that my State would be carried\nby the peace party, by fraud, as we thought, although, fraud or not, we\nwere bound to save it. Had Illinois been lost then, we should certainly\nhave lost the Presidential election, and with it probably the Union. At\nany rate, I believed the fate of the war to depend on the result. I\nwas then Governor, and upon me the responsibility rested. We had entire\ncontrol of the northern counties and of their returns. We ordered the\nreturning officers in a certain number of counties to make no returns\nuntil they heard from us, and when we had received the votes of all the\nsouthern counties and learned the precise number of votes we needed to\ngive us a majority, we telegraphed to our northern returning officers\nto make the vote of their districts such and such, thereby overbalancing\nthe adverse returns and giving the State to us. This was done, and as I\nam now senator I have a right to suppose that what I did was approved. I\nam not proud of the transaction, but I would do it again, and worse than\nthat, if I thought it would save this country from disunion. But of\ncourse I did not expect Mr. Carrington to approve it. I believe he was\nthen carrying out his reform principles by bearing arms against the\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Carrington drily; \"you got the better of me, too. Like the\nold Scotchman, you didn't care who made the people's wars provided you\nmade its ballots.\"\n\nCarrington had missed his point. The man who has committed a murder for\nhis country, is a patriot and not an assassin, even when he receives a\nseat in the Senate as his share of the plunder. Women cannot be expected\nto go behind the motives of that patriot who saves his country and his\nelection in times of revolution.\n\nCarrington's hostility to Ratcliffe was, however, mild, when compared\nwith that felt by old Baron Jacobi. Why the baron should have taken so\nviolent a prejudice it is not easy to explain, but a diplomatist and a\nsenator are natural enemies, and Jacobi, as an avowed admirer of\nMrs. Lee, found Ratcliffe in his way. This prejudiced and immoral old\ndiplomatist despised and loathed an American senator as the type\nwhich, to his bleared European eyes, combined the utmost pragmatical\nself-assurance and overbearing temper with the narrowest education and\nthe meanest personal experience that ever existed in any considerable\ngovernment. As Baron Jacobi's country had no special relations with that\nof the United States, and its Legation at Washington was a mere job to\ncreate a place for Jacobi to fill, he had no occasion to disguise his\npersonal antipathies, and he considered himself in some degree as having\na mission to express that diplomatic contempt for the Senate which his\ncolleagues, if they felt it, were obliged to conceal. He performed his\nduties with conscientious precision. He never missed an opportunity to\nthrust the sharp point of his dialectic rapier through the joints of the\nclumsy and hide-bound senatorial self-esteem. He delighted in skilfully\nexposing to Madeleine's eyes some new side of Ratcliffe's ignorance.\nHis conversation at such times sparkled with historical allusions,\nquotations in half a dozen different languages, references to well-known\nfacts which an old man's memory could not recall with precision in all\ntheir details, but with which the Honourable Senator was familiarly\nacquainted, and which he could readily supply. And his Voltairian\nface leered politely as he listened to Ratcliffe's reply, which showed\ninvariable ignorance of common literature, art, and history. The climax\nof his triumph came one evening when Ratcliffe unluckily, tempted by\nsome allusion to Moli\u00c3\u00a8re which he thought he understood, made reference\nto the unfortunate influence of that great man on the religious opinions\nof his time. Jacobi, by a flash of inspiration, divined that he had\nconfused Moli\u00c3\u00a8re with Voltaire, and assuming a manner of extreme\nsuavity, he put his victim on the rack, and tortured him with affected\nexplanations and interrogations, until Madeleine was in a manner forced\nto interrupt and end the scene. But even when the senator was not to be\nlured into a trap, he could not escape assault. The baron in such a\ncase would cross the lines and attack him on his own ground, as on one\noccasion, when Ratcliffe was defending his doctrine of party allegiance,\nJacobi silenced him by sneering somewhat thus:\n\n\"Your principle is quite correct, Mr. Senator. I, too, like yourself,\nwas once a good party man: my party was that of the Church; I was\nultramontane. Your party system is one of your thefts from our Church;\nyour National Convention is our OEcumenic Council; you abdicate reason,\nas we do, before its decisions; and you yourself, Mr. Ratcliffe, you are\na Cardinal. They are able men, those cardinals; I have known many; they\nwere our best friends, but they were not reformers. Are you a reformer,\nMr. Senator?\"\n\nRatcliffe grew to dread and hate the old man, but all his ordinary\ntactics were powerless against this impenetrable eighteenth century\ncynic. If he resorted to his Congressional practise of browbeating\nand dogmatism, the Baron only smiled and turned his back, or made some\nremark in French which galled his enemy all the more, because, while\nhe did not understand it, he knew well that Madeleine did, and that she\ntried to repress her smile.\n\nRatcliffe's grey eyes grew colder and stonier than ever as he gradually\nperceived that Baron Jacobi was carrying on a set scheme with malignant\ningenuity, to drive him out of Madeleine's house, and he swore\na terrible oath that he would not be beaten by that monkey-faced\nforeigner. On the other hand Jacobi had little hope of success: \"What\ncan an old man do?\" said he with perfect sincerity to Carrington; \"If\nI were forty years younger, that great oaf should not have his own way.\nAh! I wish I were young again and we were in Vienna!\" From which it was\nrightly inferred by Carrington that the venerable diplomatist would, if\nsuch acts were still in fashion, have coolly insulted the Senator, and\nput a bullet through his heart.\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nIN February the weather became warmer and summer-like. In Virginia there\ncomes often at this season a deceptive gleam of summer, slipping in\nbetween heavy storm-clouds of sleet and snow; days and sometimes weeks\nwhen the temperature is like June; when the earliest plants begin to\nshow their hardy flowers, and when the bare branches of the forest trees\nalone protest against the conduct of the seasons. Then men and women are\nlanguid; life seems, as in Italy, sensuous and glowing with colour; one\nis conscious of walking in an atmosphere that is warm, palpable, radiant\nwith possibilities; a delicate haze hangs over Arlington, and softens\neven the harsh white glare of the Capitol; the struggle of existence\nseems to abate; Lent throws its calm shadow over society; and youthful\ndiplomatists, unconscious of their danger, are lured into asking foolish\ngirls to marry them; the blood thaws in the heart and flows out into the\nveins, like the rills of sparkling water that trickle from every lump\nof ice or snow, as though all the ice and snow on earth, and all the\nhardness of heart, all the heresy and schism, all the works of the\ndevil, had yielded to the force of love and to the fresh warmth of\ninnocent, lamb-like, confiding virtue. In such a world there should be\nno guile--but there is a great deal of it notwithstanding. Indeed, at\nno other season is there so much. This is the moment when the two whited\nsepulchres at either end of the Avenue reek with the thick atmosphere of\nbargain and sale. The old is going; the new is coming. Wealth, office,\npower are at auction. Who bids highest? who hates with most venom? who\nintrigues with most skill? who has done the dirtiest, the meanest, the\ndarkest, and the most, political work? He shall have his reward.\n\nSenator Ratcliffe was absorbed and ill at ease. A swarm of applicants\nfor office dogged his steps and beleaguered his rooms in quest of his\nendorsement of their paper characters. The new President was to arrive\non Monday. Intrigues and combinations, of which the Senator was the\nsoul, were all alive, awaiting this arrival. Newspaper correspondents\npestered him with questions. Brother senators called him to conferences.\nHis mind was pre-occupied with his own interests. One might have\nsupposed that, at this instant, nothing could have drawn him away from\nthe political gaming-table, and yet when Mrs. Lee remarked that she was\ngoing to Mount Vernon on Saturday with a little party, including the\nBritish Minister and an Irish gentleman staying as a guest at the\nBritish Legation, the Senator surprised her by expressing a strong wish\nto join them. He explained that, as the political lead was no longer\nin his hands, the chances were nine in ten that if he stirred at all\nhe should make a blunder; that his friends expected him to do something\nwhen, in fact, nothing could be done; that every preparation had already\nbeen made, and that for him to go on an excursion to Mount Vernon, at\nthis moment, with the British Minister, was, on the whole, about the\nbest use he could make of his time, since it would hide him for one day\nat least.\n\nLord Skye had fallen into the habit of consulting Mrs. Lee when his own\nsocial resources were low, and it was she who had suggested this party\nto Mount Vernon, with Carrington for a guide and Mr. Gore for variety,\nto occupy the time of the Irish friend whom Lord Skye was bravely\nentertaining.\n\nThis gentleman, who bore the title of Dunbeg, was a dilapidated peer,\nneither wealthy nor famous. Lord Skye brought him to call on Mrs. Lee,\nand in some sort put him under her care. He was young, not ill-looking,\nquite intelligent, rather too fond of facts, and not quick at humour.\nHe was given to smiling in a deprecatory way, and when he talked, he\nwas either absent or excited; he made vague blunders, and then smiled\nin deprecation of offence, or his words blocked their own path in their\nrush. Perhaps his manner was a little ridiculous, but he had a good\nheart, a good head, and a title. He found favour in the eyes of Sybil\nand Victoria Dare, who declined to admit other women to the party,\nalthough they offered no objection to Mr.\n\nRatcliffe's admission. As for Lord Dunbeg, he was an enthusiastic\nadmirer of General Washington, and, as he privately intimated, eager to\nstudy phases of American society. He was delighted to go with a small\nparty, and Miss Dare secretly promised herself that she would show him a\nphase.\n\nThe morning was warm, the sky soft, the little steamer lay at the quiet\nwharf with a few negroes lazily watching her preparations for departure.\n\nCarrington, with Mrs. Lee and the young ladies, arrived first, and stood\nleaning against the rail, waiting the arrival of their companions. Then\ncame Mr. Gore, neatly attired and gloved, with a light spring overcoat;\nfor Mr.\n\nGore was very careful of his personal appearance, and not a little vain\nof his good looks. Then a pretty woman, with blue eyes and blonde hair,\ndressed in black, and leading a little girl by the hand, came on board,\nand Carrington went to shake hands with her. On his return to Mrs. Lee's\nside, she asked about his new acquaintance, and he replied with a\nhalf-laugh, as though he were not proud of her, that she was a client,\na pretty widow, well known in Washington. \"Any one at the Capitol would\ntell you all about her. She was the wife of a noted lobbyist, who died\nabout two years ago. Congressmen can refuse nothing to a pretty face,\nand she was their idea of feminine perfection. Yet she is a silly little\nwoman, too. Her husband died after a very short illness, and, to my\ngreat surprise, made me executor under his will. I think he had an idea\nthat he could trust me with his papers, which were important and\ncompromising, for he seems to have had no time to go over them and\ndestroy what were best out of the way. So, you see, I am left with his\nwidow and child to look after. Luckily, they are well provided for.\"\n\n\"Still you have not told me her name.\"\n\n\"Her name is Baker--Mrs. Sam Baker. But they are casting off, and Mr.\nRatcliffe will be left behind. I'll ask the captain to wait.\" About a\ndozen passengers had arrived, among them the two Earls, with a footman\ncarrying a promising lunch-basket, and the planks were actually hauled\nin when a carriage dashed up to the wharf, and Mr. Ratcliffe leaped out\nand hurried on board. \"Off with you as quick as you can!\" said he to\nthe negro-hands, and in another moment the little steamer had begun her\njourney, pounding the muddy waters of the Potomac and sending up its\nsmall column of smoke as though it were a newly invented incense-burner\napproaching the temple of the national deity. Ratcliffe explained in\ngreat glee how he had barely managed to escape his visitors by telling\nthem that the British Minister was waiting for him, and that he would\nbe back again presently. \"If they had known where I was going,\" said\nhe, \"you would have seen the boat swamped with office-seekers. Illinois\nalone would have brought you to a watery grave.\" He was in high spirits,\nbent upon enjoying his holiday, and as they passed the arsenal with\nits solitary sentry, and the navy-yard, with its one unseaworthy wooden\nwar-steamer, he pointed out these evidences of national grandeur to Lord\nSkye, threatening, as the last terror of diplomacy, to send him home in\nan American frigate. They were thus indulging in senatorial humour on\none side of the boat, while Sybil and Victoria, with the aid of Mr. Gore\nand Carrington, were improving Lord Dunbeg's mind on the other.\n\nMiss Dare, finding for herself at last a convenient seat where she could\nrepose and be mistress of the situation, put on a more than usually\ndemure expression and waited with gravity until her noble neighbour\nshould give her an opportunity to show those powers which, as she\nbelieved, would supply a phase in his existence. Miss Dare was one of\nthose young persons, sometimes to be found in America, who seem to have\nno object in life, and while apparently devoted to men, care nothing\nabout them, but find happiness only in violating rules; she made no\nparade of whatever virtues she had, and her chief pleasure was to make\nfun of all the world and herself.\n\n\"What a noble river!\" remarked Lord Dunbeg, as the boat passed out upon\nthe wide stream; \"I suppose you often sail on it?\"\n\n\"I never was here in my life till now,\" replied the untruthful Miss\nDare; \"we don't think much of it; it s too small; we're used to so much\nlarger rivers.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you would not like our English rivers then; they are mere\nbrooks compared with this.\"\n\n\"Are they indeed?\" said Victoria, with an appearance of vague surprise;\n\"how curious! I don't think I care to be an Englishwoman then. I could\nnot live without big rivers.\"\n\nLord Dunbeg stared, and hinted that this was almost unreasonable.\n\n\"Unless I were a Countess!\" continued Victoria, meditatively, looking\nat Alexandria, and paying no attention to his lordship; \"I think I could\nmanage if I were a C-c-countess. It is such a pretty title!\"\n\n\"Duchess is commonly thought a prettier one,\" stammered Dunbeg, much\nembarrassed. The young man was not used to chaff from women.\n\n\"I should be satisfied with Countess. It sounds well. I am surprised\nthat you don't like it.\" Dunbeg looked about him uneasily for some means\nof escape but he was barred in. \"I should think you would feel an awful\nresponsibility in selecting a Countess. How do you do it?\"\n\nLord Dunbeg nervously joined in the general laughter as Sybil\nejaculated:\n\n\"Oh, Victoria!\" but Miss Dare continued without a smile or any elevation\nof her monotonous voice:\n\n\"Now, Sybil, don't interrupt me, please. I am deeply interested in Lord\nDunbeg's conversation. He understands that my interest is purely\nscientific, but my happiness requires that I should know how Countesses\nare selected. Lord Dunbeg, how would you recommend a friend to choose a\nCountess?\"\n\nLord Dunbeg began to be amused by her impudence, and he even tried to\nlay down for her satisfaction one or two rules for selecting Countesses,\nbut long before he had invented his first rule, Victoria had darted off\nto a new subject.\n\n\"Which would you rather be, Lord Dunbeg? an Earl or George Washington?\"\n\n\"George Washington, certainly,\" was the Earl's courteous though rather\nbewildered reply.\n\n\"Really?\" she asked with a languid affectation of surprise; \"it is\nawfully kind of you to say so, but of course you can't mean it.\n\n\"Indeed I do mean it.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? I never should have thought it.\"\n\n\"Why not, Miss Dare?\"\n\n\"You have not the air of wishing to be George Washington.\"\n\n\"May I again ask, why not?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Did you ever see George Washington?\"\n\n\"Of course not. He died fifty years before I was born.\"\n\n\"I thought so. You see you don't know him. Now, will you give us an idea\nof what you imagine General Washington to have looked like?\"\n\nDunbeg gave accordingly a flattering description of General Washington,\ncompounded of Stuart's portrait and Greenough's statue of Olympian Jove\nwith Washington's features, in the Capitol Square. Miss Dare listened\nwith an expression of superiority not unmixed with patience, and then\nshe enlightened him as follows:\n\n\"All you have been saying is perfect stuff--excuse the vulgarity of the\nexpression. When I am a Countess I will correct my language. The\ntruth is that General Washington was a raw-boned country farmer, very\nhard-featured, very awkward, very illiterate and very dull; very bad\ntempered, very profane, and generally tipsy after dinner.\"\n\n\"You shock me, Miss Dare!\" exclaimed Dunbeg.\n\n\"Oh! I know all about General Washington. My grandfather knew him\nintimately, and often stayed at Mount Vernon for weeks together. You\nmust not believe what you read, and not a word of what Mr. Carrington\nwill say. He is a Virginian and will tell you no end of fine stories and\nnot a syllable of truth in one of them. We are all patriotic about\nWashington and like to hide his faults. If I weren't quite sure you\nwould never repeat it, I would not tell you this. The truth is that even\nwhen George Washington was a small boy, his temper was so violent that\nno one could do anything with him. He once cut down all his father's\nfruit-trees in a fit of passion, and then, just because they wanted to\nflog him, he threatened to brain his father with the hatchet. His aged\nwife suffered agonies from him. My grandfather often told me how he had\nseen the General pinch and swear at her till the poor creature left the\nroom in tears; and how once at Mount Vernon he saw Washington, when\nquite an old man, suddenly rush at an unoffending visitor, and chase him\noff the place, beating him all the time over the head with a great stick\nwith knots in it, and all just because he heard the poor man stammer; he\nnever could abide s-s-stammering.\"\n\nCarrington and Gore burst into shouts of laughter over this description\nof the Father of his country, but Victoria continued in her gentle drawl\nto enlighten Lord Dunbeg in regard to other subjects with information\nequally mendacious, until he decided that she was quite the most\neccentric person he had ever met. The boat arrived at Mount Vernon while\nshe was still engaged in a description of the society and manners of\nAmerica, and especially of the rules which made an offer of marriage\nnecessary. According to her, Lord Dunbeg was in imminent peril;\ngentlemen, and especially foreigners, were expected, in all the States\nsouth of the Potomac, to offer themselves to at least one young lady in\nevery city: \"and I had only yesterday,\" said Victoria, \"a letter from a\nlovely girl in North Carolina, a dear friend of mine, who wrote me that\nshe was right put out because her brothers had called on a young English\nvisitor with shot guns, and she was afraid he wouldn't recover, and,\nafter all, she says she should have refused him.\"\n\nMeanwhile Madeleine, on the other side of the boat, undisturbed by the\nlaughter that surrounded Miss Dare, chatted soberly and seriously with\nLord Skye and Senator Ratcliffe. Lord Skye, too, a little intoxicated\nby the brilliancy of the morning, broke out into admiration of the noble\nriver, and accused Americans of not appreciating the beauties of their\nown country.\n\n\"Your national mind,\" said he, \"has no eyelids. It requires a broad\nglare and a beaten road. It prefers shadows which you can cut out with a\nknife. It doesn't know the beauty of this Virginia winter softness.\"\n\nMrs. Lee resented the charge. America, she maintained, had not worn her\nfeelings threadbare like Europe. She had still her story to tell; she\nwas waiting for her Burns and Scott, her Wordsworth and Byron, her\nHogarth and Turner. \"You want peaches in spring,\" said she. \"Give us\nour thousand years of summer, and then complain, if you please, that our\npeach is not as mellow as yours. Even our voices may be soft then,\" she\nadded, with a significant look at Lord Skye.\n\n\"We are at a disadvantage in arguing with Mrs. Lee,\" said he to\nRatcliffe; \"when she ends as counsel, she begins as witness. The famous\nDuchess of Devonshire's lips were not half as convincing as Mrs. Lee's\nvoice.\"\n\nRatcliffe listened carefully, assenting whenever he saw that Mrs. Lee\nwished it. He wished he understood precisely what tones and half-tones,\ncolours and harmonies, were.\n\nThey arrived and strolled up the sunny path. At the tomb they halted,\nas all good Americans do, and Mr. Gore, in a tone of subdued sorrow,\ndelivered a short address--\n\n\"It might be much worse if they improved it,\" he said, surveying its\nproportions with the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic eye of a cultured Bostonian. \"As it\nstands, this tomb is a simple misfortune which might befall any of us;\nwe should not grieve over it too much. What would our feelings be if\na Congressional committee reconstructed it of white marble with Gothic\npepper-pots, and gilded it inside on machine-moulded stucco!\"\n\nMadeleine, however, insisted that the tomb, as it stood, was the only\nrestless spot about the quiet landscape, and that it contradicted all\nher ideas about repose in the grave. Ratcliffe wondered what she meant.\n\nThey passed on, wandering across the lawn, and through the house. Their\neyes, weary of the harsh colours and forms of the city, took pleasure in\nthe worn wainscots and the stained walls. Some of the rooms were still\noccupied; fires were burning in the wide fire-places. All were tolerably\nfurnished, and there was no uncomfortable sense of repair or newness.\nThey mounted the stairs, and Mrs. Lee fairly laughed when she was shown\nthe room in which General Washington slept, and where he died.\n\nCarrington smiled too. \"Our old Virginia houses were mostly like this,\"\nsaid he; \"suites of great halls below, and these gaunt barracks above.\nThe Virginia house was a sort of hotel. When there was a race or a\nwedding, or a dance, and the house was full, they thought nothing of\npacking half a dozen people in one room, and if the room was large, they\nstretched a sheet a cross to separate the men from the women. As for\ntoilet, those were not the mornings of cold baths. With our ancestors a\nlittle washing went a long way.\"\n\n\"Do you still live so in Virginia?\" asked Madeleine.\n\n\"Oh no, it is quite gone. We live now like other country people, and try\nto pay our debts, which that generation never did. They lived from hand\nto mouth. They kept a stable-full of horses. The young men were always\nriding about the country, betting on horse-races, gambling, drinking,\nfighting, and making love. No one knew exactly what he was worth until\nthe crash came about fifty years ago, and the whole thing ran out.\"\n\n\"Just what happened in Ireland!\" said Lord Dunbeg, much interested and\nfull of his article in the Quarterly; \"the resemblance is perfect, even\ndown to the houses.\"\n\nMrs. Lee asked Carrington bluntly whether he regretted the destruction\nof this old social arrangement.\n\n\"One can't help regretting,\" said he, \"whatever it was that produced\nGeorge Washington, and a crowd of other men like him. But I think we\nmight produce the men still if we had the same field for them.\"\n\n\"And would you bring the old society back again if you could?\" asked\nshe.\n\n\"What for? It could not hold itself up. General Washington himself could\nnot save it. Before he died he had lost his hold on Virginia, and his\npower was gone.\"\n\nThe party for a while separated, and Mrs. Lee found herself alone in the\ngreat drawing-room. Presently the blonde Mrs. Baker entered, with her\nchild, who ran about making more noise than Mrs. Washington would have\npermitted.\n\nMadeleine, who had the usual feminine love of children, called the girl\nto her and pointed out the shepherds and shepherdesses carved on the\nwhite Italian marble of the fireplace; she invented a little story\nabout them to amuse the child, while the mother stood by and at the end\nthanked the story-teller with more enthusiasm than seemed called for.\nMrs. Lee did not fancy her effusive manner, or her complexion, and was\nglad when Dunbeg appeared at the doorway.\n\n\"How do you like General Washington at home?\" asked she.\n\n\"Really, I assure you I feel quite at home myself,\" replied Dunbeg, with\na more beaming smile than ever. \"I am sure General Washington was an\nIrishman. I know it from the look of the place. I mean to look it up and\nwrite an article about it.\"\n\n\"Then if you have disposed of him,\" said Madeleine, \"I think we will\nhave luncheon, and I have taken the liberty to order it to be served\noutside.\"\n\nThere a table had been improvised, and Miss Dare was inspecting the\nlunch, and making comments upon Lord Skye's cuisine and cellar.\n\n\"I hope it is very dry champagne,\" said she, \"the taste for sweet\nchampagne is quite awfully shocking.\"\n\nThe young woman knew no more about dry and sweet champagne than of the\nwine of Ulysses, except that she drank both with equal satisfaction, but\nshe was mimicking a Secretary of the British Legation who had provided\nher with supper at her last evening party. Lord Skye begged her to try\nit, which she did, and with great gravity remarked that it was about\nfive per cent. she presumed. This, too, was caught from her Secretary,\nthough she knew no more what it meant than if she had been a parrot.\n\nThe luncheon was very lively and very good. When it was over, the\ngentlemen were allowed to smoke, and conversation fell into a sober\nstrain, which at last threatened to become serious.\n\n\"You want half-tones!\" said Madeleine to Lord Skye: \"are there not\nhalf-tones enough to suit you on the walls of this house?\"\n\nLord Skye suggested that this was probably owing to the fact that\nWashington, belonging, as he did, to the universe, was in his taste an\nexception to local rules.\n\n\"Is not the sense of rest here captivating?\" she continued. \"Look at\nthat quaint garden, and this ragged lawn, and the great river in front,\nand the superannuated fort beyond the river! Everything is peaceful,\neven down to the poor old General's little bed-room. One would like to\nlie down in it and sleep a century or two. And yet that dreadful Capitol\nand its office-seekers are only ten miles off.\"\n\n\"No! that is more than I can bear!\" broke in Miss Victoria in a stage\nwhisper, \"that dreadful Capitol! Why, not one of us would be here\nwithout that dreadful Capitol! except, perhaps, myself.\"\n\n\"You would appear very well as Mrs. Washington, Victoria.\"\n\n\"Miss Dare has been so very obliging as to give us her views of General\nWashington's character this morning,\" said Dunbeg, \"but I have not yet\nhad time to ask Mr. Carrington for his.\"\n\n\"Whatever Miss Dare says is valuable,\" replied Carrington, \"but her\nstrong point is facts.\"\n\n\"Never flatter! Mr. Carrington,\" drawled Miss Dare; \"I do not need it,\nand it does not become your style. Tell me, Lord Dunbeg, is not Mr.\nCarrington a little your idea of General Washington restored to us in\nhis prime?\"\n\n\"After your account of General Washington, Miss Dare, how can I agree\nwith you?\"\n\n\"After all,\" said Lord Skye, \"I think we must agree that Miss Dare is in\nthe main right about the charms of Mount Vernon. Even Mrs. Lee, on the\nway up, agreed that the General, who is the only permanent resident\nhere, has the air of being confoundedly bored in his tomb. I don't\nmyself love your dreadful Capitol yonder, but I prefer it to a bucolic\nlife here. And I account in this way for my want of enthusiasm for your\ngreat General. He liked no kind of life but this. He seems to have been\ngreater in the character of a home-sick Virginia planter than as General\nor President. I forgive him his inordinate dulness, for he was not a\ndiplomatist and it was not his business to lie, but he might once in a\nway have forgotten Mount Vernon.\"\n\nDunbeg here burst in with an excited protest; all his words seemed to\nshove each other aside in their haste to escape first. \"All our greatest\nEnglishmen have been home-sick country squires. I am a home-sick country\nsquire myself.\"\n\n\"How interesting!\" said Miss Dare under her breath.\n\nMr. Gore here joined in: \"It is all very well for you gentlemen to\nmeasure General Washington according to your own private twelve-inch\ncarpenter's rule. But what will you say to us New Englanders who never\nwere country gentlemen at all, and never had any liking for Virginia?\nWhat did Washington ever do for us? He never even pretended to like us.\nHe never was more than barely civil to us. I'm not finding fault with\nhim; everybody knows that he never cared for anything but Mount Vernon.\nFor all that, we idolize him. To us he is Morality, Justice, Duty,\nTruth; half a dozen Roman gods with capital letters. He is austere,\nsolitary, grand; he ought to be deified. I hardly feel easy, eating,\ndrinking, smoking here on his portico without his permission, taking\nliberties with his house, criticising his bedrooms in his absence.\nSuppose I heard his horse now trotting up on the other side, and he\nsuddenly appeared at this door and looked at us. I should abandon you to\nhis indignation. I should run away and hide myself on the steamer. The\nmere thought unmans me.\"\n\nRatcliffe seemed amused at Gore's half-serious notions. \"You recall\nto me,\" said he, \"my own feelings when I was a boy and was made by my\nfather to learn the Farewell Address by heart. In those days General\nWashington was a sort of American Jehovah. But the West is a poor\nschool for Reverence. Since coming to Congress I have learned more about\nGeneral Washington, and have been surprised to find what a narrow\nbase his reputation rests on. A fair military officer, who made many\nblunders, and who never had more men than would make a full army-corps\nunder his command, he got an enormous reputation in Europe because he\ndid not make himself king, as though he ever had a chance of doing it.\nA respectable, painstaking President, he was treated by the Opposition\nwith an amount of deference that would have made government easy to a\nbaby, but it worried him to death. His official papers are fairly done,\nand contain good average sense such as a hundred thousand men in the\nUnited States would now write. I suspect that half of his attachment to\nthis spot rose from his consciousness of inferior powers and his dread\nof responsibility. This government can show to-day a dozen men of equal\nabilities, but we don't deify them. What I most wonder at in him is\nnot his military or political genius at all, for I doubt whether he\nhad much, but a curious Yankee shrewdness in money matters. He thought\nhimself a very rich man, yet he never spent a dollar foolishly. He was\nalmost the only Virginian I ever heard of, in public life, who did not\ndie insolvent.\"\n\nDuring this long speech, Carrington glanced across at Madeleine, and\ncaught her eye. Ratcliffe's criticism was not to her taste. Carrington\ncould see that she thought it unworthy of him, and he knew that it would\nirritate her.\n\n\"I will lay a little trap for Mr. Ratcliffe,\" thought he to himself;\n\"we will see whether he gets out of it.\" So Carrington began, and all\nlistened closely, for, as a Virginian, he was supposed to know much\nabout the subject, and his family had been deep in the confidence of\nWashington himself.\n\n\"The neighbours hereabout had for many years, and may have still, some\ncurious stories about General Washington's closeness in money matters.\nThey said he never bought anything by weight but he had it weighed over\nagain, nor by tale but he had it counted, and if the weight or number\nwere not exact, he sent it back. Once, during his absence, his steward\nhad a room plastered, and paid the plasterer's bill. On the General's\nreturn, he measured the room, and found that the plasterer had charged\nfifteen shillings too much. Meanwhile the man had died, and the General\nmade a claim of fifteen shillings on his estate, which was paid. Again,\none of his tenants brought him the rent. The exact change of fourpence\nwas required. The man tendered a dollar, and asked the General to credit\nhim with the balance against the next year's rent. The General refused\nand made him ride nine miles to Alexandria and back for the fourpence.\nOn the other hand, he sent to a shoemaker in Alexandria to come and\nmeasure him for shoes. The man returned word that he did not go to any\none's house to take measures, and the General mounted his horse and rode\nthe nine miles to him. One of his rules was to pay at taverns the same\nsum for his servants' meals as for his own. An inn-keeper brought him a\nbill of three-and-ninepence for his own breakfast, and three shillings\nfor his servant. He insisted upon adding the extra ninepence, as he did\nnot doubt that the servant had eaten as much as he. What do you say to\nthese anecdotes? Was this meanness or not?\"\n\nRatcliffe was amused. \"The stories are new to me,\" he said. \"It is just\nas I thought. These are signs of a man who thinks much of trifles; one\nwho fusses over small matters. We don't do things in that way now that\nwe no longer have to get crops from granite, as they used to do in New\nHampshire when I was a boy.\"\n\nCarrington replied that it was unlucky for Virginians that they had not\ndone things in that way then: if they had, they would not have gone to\nthe dogs.\n\nGore shook his head seriously; \"Did I not tell you so?\" said he. \"Was\nnot this man an abstract virtue? I give you my word I stand in awe\nbefore him, and I feel ashamed to pry into these details of his life.\nWhat is it to us how he thought proper to apply his principles to\nnightcaps and feather dusters? We are not his body servants, and we\ncare nothing about his infirmities. It is enough for us to know that he\ncarried his rules of virtue down to a pin's point, and that we ought,\none and all, to be on our knees before his tomb.\"\n\nDunbeg, pondering deeply, at length asked Carrington whether all this\ndid not make rather a clumsy politician of the father of his country.\n\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe knows more about politics than I. Ask him,\" said\nCarrington.\n\n\"Washington was no politician at all, as we understand the word,\"\nreplied Ratcliffe abruptly. \"He stood outside of politics. The thing\ncouldn't be done to-day. The people don't like that sort of royal airs.\"\n\n\"I don't understand!\" said Mrs. Lee. \"Why could you not do it now?\"\n\n\"Because I should make a fool of myself;\" replied Ratcliffe, pleased to\nthink that Mrs. Lee should put him on a level with Washington. She had\nonly meant to ask why the thing could not be done, and this little touch\nof Ratcliffe's vanity was inimitable.\n\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe means that Washington was too respectable for our time,\"\ninterposed Carrington.\n\nThis was deliberately meant to irritate Ratcliffe, and it did so all\nthe more because Mrs. Lee turned to Carrington, and said, with some\nbitterness:\n\n\"Was he then the only honest public man we ever had?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" replied Carrington cheerfully; \"there have been one or two\nothers.\"\n\n\"If the rest of our Presidents had been like him,\" said Gore, \"we should\nhave had fewer ugly blots on our short history.\"\n\nRatcliffe was exasperated at Carrington's habit of drawing discussion to\nthis point. He felt the remark as a personal insult, and he knew it to\nbe intended. \"Public men,\" he broke out, \"cannot be dressing themselves\nto-day in Washington's old clothes. If Washington were President now, he\nwould have to learn our ways or lose his next election. Only fools and\ntheorists imagine that our society can be handled with gloves or long\npoles. One must make one's self a part of it. If virtue won't answer our\npurpose, we must use vice, or our opponents will put us out of office,\nand this was as true in Washington's day as it is now, and always will\nbe.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Lord Skye, who was beginning to fear an open quarrel; \"the\nconversation verges on treason, and I am accredited to this government.\nWhy not examine the grounds?\"\n\nA kind of natural sympathy led Lord Dunbeg to wander by the side of Miss\nDare through the quaint old garden. His mind being much occupied by the\neffort of stowing away the impressions he had just received, he was more\nthan usually absent in his manner, and this want of attention irritated\nthe young lady. She made some comments on flowers; she invented some\nnew species with startling names; she asked whether these were known in\nIreland; but Lord Dunbeg was for the moment so vague in his answers that\nshe saw her case was perilous.\n\n\"Here is an old sun-dial. Do you have sun-dials in Ireland, Lord\nDunbeg?\"\n\n\"Yes; oh, certainly! What! sun-dials? Oh, yes! I assure you there are a\ngreat many sun-dials in Ireland, Miss Dare.\"\n\n\"I am so glad. But I suppose they are only for ornament. Here it is just\nthe other way. Look at this one! they all behave like that. The wear and\ntear of our sun is too much for them; they don't last. My uncle, who has\na place at Long Branch, had five sun-dials in ten years.\"\n\n\"How very odd! But really now, Miss Dare, I don't see how a sun--dial\ncould wear out.\"\n\n\"Don't you? How strange! Don't you see, they get soaked with sunshine so\nthat they can't hold shadow. It's like me, you know. I have such a\ngood time all the time that I can't be unhappy. Do you ever read the\nBurlington Hawkeye, Lord Dunbeg?\"\n\n\"I don't remember; I think not. Is it an American serial?\" gasped\nDunbeg, trying hard to keep pace with Miss Dare in her reckless dashes\nacross country.\n\n\"No, not serial at all!\" replied Virginia; \"but I am afraid you would\nfind it very hard reading. I shouldn't try.\"\n\n\"Do you read it much, Miss Dare?\"\n\n\"Oh, always! I am not really as light as I seem. But then I have an\nadvantage over you because I know the language.\"\n\nBy this time Dunbeg was awake again, and Miss Dare, satisfied with her\nsuccess, allowed herself to become more reasonable, until a slight shade\nof sentiment began to flicker about their path.\n\nThe scattered party, however, soon had to unite again. The boat rang\nits bell for return, they filed down the paths and settled themselves\nin their old places. As they steamed away, Mrs. Lee watched the sunny\nhill-side and the peaceful house above, until she could see them no\nmore, and the longer she looked, the less she was pleased with herself.\nWas it true, as Victoria Dare said, that she could not live in so pure\nan air? Did she really need the denser fumes of the city? Was she,\nunknown to herself; gradually becoming tainted with the life about her?\nor was Ratcliffe right in accepting the good and the bad together, and\nin being of his time since he was in it? Why was it, she said bitterly\nto herself; that everything Washington touched, he purified, even down\nto the associations of his house? and why is it that everything we touch\nseems soiled? Why do I feel unclean when I look at Mount Vernon? In\nspite of Mr. Ratcliffe, is it not better to be a child and to cry for\nthe moon and stars?\n\nThe little Baker girl came up to her where she stood, and began playing\nwith her parasol.\n\n\"Who is your little friend?\" asked Ratcliffe.\n\nMrs. Lee rather vaguely replied that she was the daughter of that pretty\nwoman in black; she believed her name was Baker.\n\n\"Baker, did you say?\" repeated Ratcliffe.\n\n\"Baker--Mrs. Sam Baker; at least so Mr. Carrington told me; he said she\nwas a client of his.\"\n\nIn fact Ratcliffe soon saw Carrington go up to her and remain by her\nside during the rest of the trip. Ratcliffe watched them sharply and\ngrew more and more absorbed in his own thoughts as the boat drew nearer\nand nearer the shore.\n\nCarrington was in high spirits. He thought he had played his cards with\nunusual success. Even Miss Dare deigned to acknowledge his charms that\nday.\n\nShe declared herself to be the moral image of Martha Washington, and she\nstarted a discussion whether Carrington or Lord Dunbeg would best suit\nher in the r\u00c3\u00b4le of the General.\n\n\"Mr. Carrington is exemplary,\" she said, \"but oh, what joy to be Martha\nWashington and a Countess too!\"\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nWHEN he reached his rooms that afternoon, Senator Ratcliffe found\nthere, as he expected, a choice company of friends and admirers, who had\nbeguiled their leisure hours since noon by cursing him in every variety\nof profane language that experience could suggest and impatience\nstimulate. On his part, had he consulted his own feelings only, he would\nthen and there have turned them out, and locked the doors behind them.\nSo far as silent maledictions were concerned, no profanity of theirs\ncould hold its own against the intensity and deliberation with which,\nas he found himself approaching his own door, he expressed between his\nteeth his views in respect to their eternal interests. Nothing could be\nless suited to his present humour than the society which awaited him in\nhis rooms. He groaned in spirit as he sat down at his writing-table and\nlooked about him. Dozens of office-seekers were besieging the house;\nmen whose patriotic services in the last election called loudly for\nrecognition from a grateful country.\n\nThey brought their applications to the Senator with an entreaty that he\nwould endorse and take charge of them. Several members and senators who\nfelt that Ratcliffe had no reason for existence except to fight their\nbattle for patronage, were lounging about his room, reading newspapers,\nor beguiling their time with tobacco in various forms; at long\nintervals making dull remarks, as though they were more weary than their\nconstituents of the atmosphere that surrounds the grandest government\nthe sun ever shone upon.\n\nSeveral newspaper correspondents, eager to barter their news for\nRatcliffe's hints or suggestions, appeared from time to time on the\nscene, and, dropping into a chair by Ratcliffe's desk, whispered with\nhim in mysterious tones.\n\nThus the Senator worked on, hour after hour, mechanically doing what was\nrequired of him, signing papers without reading them, answering remarks\nwithout hearing them, hardly looking up from his desk, and appearing\nimmersed in labour. This was his protection against curiosity and\ngarrulity.\n\nThe pretence of work was the curtain he drew between himself and the\nworld.\n\nBehind this curtain his mental operations went on, undisturbed by what\nwas about him, while he heard all that was said, and said little or\nnothing himself. His followers respected this privacy, and left him\nalone. He was their prophet, and had a right to seclusion. He was their\nchieftain, and while he sat in his monosyllabic solitude, his ragged\ntail reclined in various attitudes about him, and occasionally one man\nspoke, or another swore. Newspapers and tobacco were their resource in\nperiods of absolute silence.\n\nA shade of depression rested on the faces and the voices of Clan\nRatcliffe that evening, as is not unusual with forces on the eve of\nbattle. Their remarks came at longer intervals, and were more pointless\nand random than usual. There was a want of elasticity in their bearing\nand tone, partly coming from sympathy with the evident depression of\ntheir chief; partly from the portents of the time. The President was to\narrive within forty-eight hours, and as yet there was no sign that\nhe properly appreciated their services; there were signs only too\nunmistakeable that he was painfully misled and deluded, that his\ncountenance was turned wholly in another direction, and that all their\nsacrifices were counted as worthless. There was reason to believe that\nhe came with a deliberate purpose of making war upon Ratcliffe and\nbreaking him down; of refusing to bestow patronage on them, and of\nbestowing it wherever it would injure them most deeply. At the thought\nthat their honestly earned harvest of foreign missions and consulates,\ndepartment-bureaus, custom-house and revenue offices, postmasterships,\nIndian agencies, and army and navy contracts, might now be wrung from\ntheir grasp by the selfish greed of a mere accidental intruder--a man\nwhom nobody wanted and every one ridiculed--their natures rebelled, and\nthey felt that such things must not be; that there could be no more hope\nfor democratic government if such things were possible. At this point\nthey invariably became excited, lost their equanimity, and swore. Then\nthey fell back on their faith in Ratcliffe: if any man could pull them\nthrough, he could; after all, the President must first reckon with him,\nand he was an uncommon tough customer to tackle.\n\nPerhaps, however, even their faith in Ratcliffe might have been shaken,\ncould they at that moment have looked into his mind and understood what\nwas passing there. Ratcliffe was a man vastly their superior, and he\nknew it. He lived in a world of his own and had instincts of refinement.\nWhenever his affairs went unfavourably, these instincts revived, and for\nthe time swept all his nature with them. He was now filled with disgust\nand cynical contempt for every form of politics. During long years\nhe had done his best for his party; he had sold himself to the devil,\ncoined his heart's blood, toiled with a dogged persistence that no\nday-labourer ever conceived; and all for what? To be rejected as its\ncandidate; to be put under the harrow of a small Indiana farmer who\nmade no secret of the intention to \"corral\" him, and, as he elegantly\nexpressed it, to \"take his hide and tallow.\" Ratcliffe had no great fear\nof losing his hide, but he felt aggrieved that he should be called\nupon to defend it, and that this should be the result of twenty years'\ndevotion. Like most men in the same place, he did not stop to cast\nup both columns of his account with the party, nor to ask himself the\nquestion that lay at the heart of his grievance: How far had he served\nhis party and how far himself? He was in no humour for self-analysis:\nthis requires more repose of mind than he could then command. As for\nthe President, from whom he had not heard a whisper since the insolent\nletter to Grimes, which he had taken care not to show, the Senator felt\nonly a strong impulse to teach him better sense and better manners. But\nas for political life, the events of the last six months were calculated\nto make any man doubt its value. He was quite out of sympathy with it.\nHe hated the sight of his tobacco-chewing, newspaper-reading satellites,\nwith their hats tipped at every angle except the right one, and their\nfeet everywhere except on the floor. Their conversation bored him and\ntheir presence was a nuisance. He would not submit to this slavery\nlonger. He would have given his Senatorship for a civilized house like\nMrs. Lee's, with a woman like Mrs. Lee at its head, and twenty thousand\na year for life. He smiled his only smile that evening when he thought\nhow rapidly she would rout every man Jack of his political following out\nof her parlours, and how meekly they would submit to banishment into a\nback-office with an oil-cloth carpet and two cane chairs.\n\nHe felt that Mrs. Lee was more necessary to him than the Presidency\nitself; he could not go on without her; he needed human companionship;\nsome Christian comfort for his old age; some avenue of communication\nwith that social world, which made his present surroundings look cold\nand foul; some touch of that refinement of mind and morals beside which\nhis own seemed coarse. He felt unutterably lonely. He wished Mrs.\nLee had asked him home to dinner; but Mrs. Lee had gone to bed with a\nheadache. He should not see her again for a week. Then his mind turned\nback upon their morning at Mount Vernon, and bethinking himself of Mrs.\nSam Baker, he took a sheet of note-paper, and wrote a line to Wilson\nKeen, Esq., at Georgetown, requesting him to call, if possible, the\nnext morning towards one o'clock at the Senator's rooms on a matter\nof business. Wilson Keen was chief of the Secret Service Bureau in the\nTreasury Department, and, as the depositary of all secrets, was often\ncalled upon for assistance which he was very good-natured in furnishing\nto senators, especially if they were likely to be Secretaries of the\nTreasury.\n\nThis note despatched, Mr. Ratcliffe fell back into his reflective mood,\nwhich led him apparently into still lower depths of discontent until,\nwith a muttered oath, he swore he could \"stand no more of this,\" and,\nsuddenly rising, he informed his visitors that he was sorry to leave\nthem, but he felt rather poorly and was going to bed; and to bed he\nwent, while his guests departed, each as his business or desires might\npoint him, some to drink whiskey and some to repose.\n\nOn Sunday morning Mr. Ratcliffe, as usual, went to church. He always\nattended morning service--at the Methodist Episcopal Church--not wholly\non the ground of religious conviction, but because a large number of his\nconstituents were church-going people and he would not willingly shock\ntheir principles so long as he needed their votes. In church, he kept\nhis eyes closely fixed upon the clergyman, and at the end of the sermon\nhe could say with truth that he had not heard a word of it, although the\nrespectable minister was gratified by the attention his discourse had\nreceived from the Senator from Illinois, an attention all the more\npraiseworthy because of the engrossing public cares which must at\nthat moment have distracted the Senator's mind. In this last idea,\nthe minister was right. Mr. Ratcliffe's mind was greatly distracted by\npublic cares, and one of his strongest reasons for going to church at\nall was that he might get an hour or two of undisturbed reflection.\nDuring the entire service he was absorbed in carrying on a series\nof imaginary conversations with the new President. He brought up in\nsuccession every form of proposition which the President might make to\nhim; every trap which could be laid for him; every sort of treatment he\nmight expect, so that he could not be taken by surprise, and his frank,\nsimple nature could never be at a loss. One object, however, long\nescaped him. Supposing, what was more than probable, that the\nPresident's opposition to Ratcliffe's declared friends made it\nimpossible to force any of them into office; it would then be necessary\nto try some new man, not obnoxious to the President, as a candidate for\nthe Cabinet. Who should this be? Ratcliffe pondered long and deeply,\nsearching out a man who combined the most powerful interests, with the\nfewest enmities. This subject was still uppermost at the moment when\nservice ended. Ratcliffe pondered over it as he walked back to his\nrooms. Not until he reached his own door did he come to a conclusion:\n\nCarson would do; Carson of Pennsylvania; the President had probably\nnever heard of him.\n\nMr. Wilson Keen was waiting the Senator's return, a heavy man with a\nsquare face, and good-natured, active blue eyes; a man of few words and\nthose well-considered. The interview was brief. After apologising for\nbreaking in upon Sunday with business, Mr. Ratcliffe excused himself on\nthe ground that so little time was left before the close of the session.\nA bill now before one of his Committees, on which a report must soon\nbe made, involved matters to which it was believed that the late Samuel\nBaker, formerly a well-known lobby-agent in Washington, held the only\nclue. He being dead, Mr. Ratcliffe wished to know whether he had left\nany papers behind him, and in whose hands these papers were, or whether\nany partner or associate of his was acquainted with his affairs.\n\nMr. Keen made a note of the request, merely remarking that he had been\nvery well acquainted with Baker, and also a little with his wife, who\nwas supposed to know his affairs as well as he knew them himself; and\nwho was still in Washington. He thought he could bring the information\nin a day or two. As he then rose to go, Mr. Ratcliffe added that entire\nsecrecy was necessary, as the interests involved in obstructing the\nsearch were considerable, and it was not well to wake them up. Mr. Keen\nassented and went his way.\n\nAll this was natural enough and entirely proper, at least so far as\nappeared on the surface. Had Mr. Keen been so curious in other people's\naffairs as to look for the particular legislative measure which lay at\nthe bottom of Mr.\n\nRatcliffe's inquiries, he might have searched among the papers of\nCongress a very long time and found himself greatly puzzled at last. In\nfact there was no measure of the kind. The whole story was a fiction.\nMr. Ratcliffe had scarcely thought of Baker since his death, until the\nday before, when he had seen his widow on the Mount Vernon steamer and\nhad found her in relations with Carrington. Something in Carrington's\nhabitual attitude and manner towards himself had long struck him as\npeculiar, and this connection with Mrs. Baker had suggested to the\nSenator the idea that it might be well to have an eye on both. Mrs.\nBaker was a silly woman, as he knew, and there were old transactions\nbetween Ratcliffe and Baker of which she might be informed, but which\nRatcliffe had no wish to see brought within Mrs. Lee's ken. As for\nthe fiction invented to set Keen in motion, it was an innocent one.\nIt harmed nobody. Ratcliffe selected this particular method of inquiry\nbecause it was the easiest, safest, and most effectual. If he were\nalways to wait until he could afford to tell the precise truth, business\nwould very soon be at a standstill, and his career at an end.\n\nThis little matter disposed of; the Senator from Illinois passed his\nafternoon in calling upon some of his brother senators, and the first\nof those whom he honoured with a visit was Mr. Krebs, of Pennsylvania.\nThere were many reasons which now made the co-operation of that\nhigh-minded statesman essential to Mr. Ratcliffe. The strongest of them\nwas that the Pennsylvania delegation in Congress was well disciplined\nand could be used with peculiar advantage for purposes of \"pressure.\"\nRatcliffe's success in his contest with the new President depended\non the amount of \"pressure\" he could employ. To keep himself in the\nbackground, and to fling over the head of the raw Chief Magistrate a web\nof intertwined influences, any one of which alone would be useless, but\nwhich taken together were not to be broken through; to revive the lost\nart of the Roman retiarius, who from a safe distance threw his net over\nhis adversary, before attacking with the dagger; this was Ratcliffe's\nintention and towards this he had been directing all his manipulation\nfor weeks past. How much bargaining and how many promises he found it\nnecessary to make, was known to himself alone. About this time Mrs. Lee\nwas a little surprised to find Mr. Gore speaking with entire confidence\nof having Ratcliffe's support in his application for the Spanish\nmission, for she had rather imagined that Gore was not a favourite with\nRatcliffe. She noticed too that Schneidekoupon had come back again and\nspoke mysteriously of interviews with Ratcliffe; of attempts to unite\nthe interests of New York and Pennsylvania; and his countenance took on\na dark and dramatic expression as he proclaimed that no sacrifice of the\nprinciple of protection should be tolerated. Schneidekoupon disappeared\nas suddenly as he came, and from Sybil's innocent complaints of\nhis spirits and temper, Mrs. Lee jumped to the conclusion that Mr.\nRatcliffe, Mr. Clinton, and Mr.\n\nKrebs had for the moment combined to sit heavily upon poor\nSchneidekoupon, and to remove his disturbing influence from the scene,\nat least until other men should get what they wanted. These were merely\nthe trifling incidents that fell within Mrs. Lee's observation. She felt\nan atmosphere of bargain and intrigue, but she could only imagine how\nfar it extended. Even Carrington, when she spoke to him about it, only\nlaughed and shook his head:\n\n\"Those matters are private, my dear Mrs. Lee; you and I are not meant to\nknow such things.\"\n\nThis Sunday afternoon Mr. Ratcliffe's object was to arrange the little\nmanoeuvre about Carson of Pennsylvania, which had disturbed him in\nchurch.\n\nHis efforts were crowned with success. Krebs accepted Carson and\npromised to bring him forward at ten minutes' notice, should the\nemergency arise.\n\nRatcliffe was a great statesman. The smoothness of his manipulation was\nmarvellous. No other man in politics, indeed no other man who had ever\nbeen in politics in this country, could--his admirers said--have brought\ntogether so many hostile interests and made so fantastic a combination.\nSome men went so far as to maintain that he would \"rope in the President\nhimself before the old man had time to swap knives with him.\" The beauty\nof his work consisted in the skill with which he evaded questions of\nprinciple. As he wisely said, the issue now involved was not one of\nprinciple but of power.\n\nThe fate of that noble party to which they all belonged, and which had\na record that could never be forgotten, depended on their letting\nprinciple alone. Their principle must be the want of principles. There\nwere indeed individuals who said in reply that Ratcliffe had made\npromises which never could be carried out, and there were almost\nsuperhuman elements of discord in the combination, but as Ratcliffe\nshrewdly rejoined, he only wanted it to last a week, and he guessed his\npromises would hold it up for that time.\n\nSuch was the situation when on Monday afternoon the President-elect\narrived in Washington, and the comedy began. The new President was,\nalmost as much as Abraham Lincoln or Franklin Pierce, an unknown\nquantity in political mathematics. In the national convention of the\nparty, nine months before, after some dozens of fruitless ballots in\nwhich Ratcliffe wanted but three votes of a majority, his opponents had\ndone what he was now doing; they had laid aside their principles and\nset up for their candidate a plain Indiana farmer, whose political\nexperience was limited to stump-speaking in his native State, and to one\nterm as Governor. They had pitched upon him, not because they thought\nhim competent, but because they hoped by doing so to detach Indiana from\nRatcliffe's following, and they were so successful that within fifteen\nminutes Ratcliffe's friends were routed, and the Presidency had fallen\nupon this new political Buddha.\n\nHe had begun his career as a stone-cutter in a quarry, and was, not\nunreasonably, proud of the fact. During the campaign this incident had,\nof course, filled a large space in the public mind, or, more exactly,\nin the public eye. \"The Stone-cutter of the Wabash,\" he was sometimes\ncalled; at others \"the Hoosier Quarryman,\" but his favourite appellation\nwas \"Old Granite,\" although this last endearing name, owing to an\nunfortunate similarity of sound, was seized upon by his opponents, and\ndistorted into \"Old Granny.\" He had been painted on many thousand yards\nof cotton sheeting, either with a terrific sledge-hammer, smashing the\nskulls (which figured as paving-stones) of his political opponents, or\nsplitting by gigantic blows a huge rock typical of the opposing party.\nHis opponents in their turn had paraded illuminations representing the\nQuarryman in the garb of a State's-prison convict breaking the heads\nof Ratcliffe and other well-known political leaders with a very feeble\nhammer, or as \"Old Granny\" in pauper's rags, hopelessly repairing with\nthe same heads the impossible roads which typified the ill-conditioned\nand miry ways of his party. But these violations of decency and good\nsense were universally reproved by the virtuous; and it was remarked\nwith satisfaction that the purest and most highly cultivated newspaper\neditors on his side, without excepting those of Boston itself; agreed\nwith one voice that the Stone-cutter was a noble type of man, perhaps\nthe very noblest that had appeared to adorn this country since the\nincomparable Washington.\n\nThat he was honest, all admitted; that is to say, all who voted for him.\n\nThis is a general characteristic of all new presidents. He himself took\ngreat pride in his home-spun honesty, which is a quality peculiar to\nnature's noblemen. Owing nothing, as he conceived, to politicians,\nbut sympathising through every fibre of his unselfish nature with the\nimpulses and aspirations of the people, he affirmed it to be his first\nduty to protect the people from those vultures, as he called them,\nthose wolves in sheep's clothing, those harpies, those hyenas, the\npoliticians; epithets which, as generally interpreted, meant Ratcliffe\nand Ratcliffe's friends.\n\nHis cardinal principle in politics was hostility to Ratcliffe, yet he\nwas not vindictive. He came to Washington determined to be the Father of\nhis country; to gain a proud immortality and a re-election.\n\nUpon this gentleman Ratcliffe had let loose all the forms of \"pressure\"\nwhich could be set in motion either in or out of Washington. From the\nmoment when he had left his humble cottage in Southern Indiana, he had\nbeen captured by Ratcliffe's friends, and smothered in demonstrations\nof affection. They had never allowed him to suggest the possibility\nof ill-feeling. They had assumed as a matter of course that the most\ncordial attachment existed between him and his party. On his arrival\nin Washington they systematically cut him off from contact with any\ninfluences but their own. This was not a very difficult thing to do, for\ngreat as he was, he liked to be told of his greatness, and they made him\nfeel himself a colossus. Even the few personal friends in his company\nwere manipulated with the utmost care, and their weaknesses put to use\nbefore they had been in Washington a single day.\n\nNot that Ratcliffe had anything to do with all this underhand\nand grovelling intrigue. Mr. Ratcliffe was a man of dignity and\nself-respect, who left details to his subordinates. He waited calmly\nuntil the President, recovered from the fatigues of his journey, should\nbegin to feel the effect of a Washington atmosphere. Then on Wednesday\nmorning, Mr. Ratcliffe left his rooms an hour earlier than usual on his\nway to the Senate, and called at the President's Hotel: he was ushered\ninto a large apartment in which the new Chief Magistrate was holding\ncourt, although at sight of Ratcliffe, the other visitors edged away\nor took their hats and left the room. The President proved to be a\nhard-featured man of sixty, with a hooked nose and thin, straight,\niron-gray hair. His voice was rougher than his features and he received\nRatcliffe awkwardly. He had suffered since his departure from Indiana.\nOut there it had seemed a mere flea-bite, as he expressed it, to brush\nRatcliffe aside, but in Washington the thing was somehow different.\n\nEven his own Indiana friends looked grave when he talked of it, and\nshook their heads. They advised him to be cautious and gain time; to\nlead Ratcliffe on, and if possible to throw on him the responsibility of\na quarrel. He was, therefore, like a brown bear undergoing the process\nof taming; very ill-tempered, very rough, and at the same time very much\nbewildered and a little frightened. Ratcliffe sat ten minutes with him,\nand obtained information in regard to pains which the President had\nsuffered during the previous night, in consequence, as he believed, of\nan over-indulgence in fresh lobster, a luxury in which he had found a\ndiversion from the cares of state. So soon as this matter was explained\nand condoled upon, Ratcliffe rose and took leave.\n\nEvery device known to politicians was now in full play against the\nHoosier Quarryman. State delegations with contradictory requests were\npoured in upon him, among which that of Massachusetts presented as\nits only prayer the appointment of Mr. Gore to the Spanish mission.\nDifficulties were invented to embarrass and worry him. False leads were\nsuggested, and false information carefully mingled with true. A wild\ndance was kept up under his eyes from daylight to midnight, until his\nbrain reeled with the effort to follow it. Means were also found to\nconvert one of his personal, confidential friends, who had come with him\nfrom Indiana and who had more brains or less principle than the others;\nfrom him every word of the President was brought directly to Ratcliffe's\near.\n\nEarly on Friday morning, Mr. Thomas Lord, a rival of the late Samuel\nBaker, and heir to his triumphs, appeared in Ratcliffe's rooms while the\nSenator was consuming his lonely egg and chop. Mr. Lord had been chosen\nto take general charge of the presidential party and to direct all\nmatters connected with Ratcliffe's interests. Some people might consider\nthis the work of a spy; he looked on it as a public duty. He reported\nthat \"Old Granny\" had at last shown signs of weakness. Late the previous\nevening when, according to his custom, he was smoking his pipe in\ncompany with his kitchen-cabinet of followers, he had again fallen upon\nthe subject of Ratcliffe, and with a volley of oaths had sworn that he\nwould show him his place yet, and that he meant to offer him a seat in\nthe Cabinet that would make him \"sicker than a stuck hog.\" From this\nremark and some explanatory hints that followed, it seemed that the\nQuarryman had abandoned his scheme of putting Ratcliffe to immediate\npolitical death, and had now undertaken to invite him into a Cabinet\nwhich was to be specially constructed to thwart and humiliate him.\n\nThe President, it appeared, warmly applauded the remark of one\ncounsellor, that Ratcliffe was safer in the Cabinet than in the Senate,\nand that it would be easy to kick him out when the time came.\n\nRatcliffe smiled grimly as Mr. Lord, with much clever mimicry, described\nthe President's peculiarities of language and manner, but he said\nnothing and waited for the event. The same evening came a note from the\nPresident's private secretary requesting his attendance, if possible,\nto-morrow, Saturday morning, at ten o'clock. The note was curt and cool.\nRatcliffe merely sent back word that he would come, and felt a little\nregret that the President should not know enough etiquette to understand\nthat this verbal answer was intended as a hint to improve his manners.\nHe did come accordingly, and found the President looking blacker\nthan before. This time there was no avoiding of tender subjects. The\nPresident meant to show Ratcliffe by the decision of his course, that\nhe was master of the situation. He broke at once into the middle of\nthe matter: \"I sent for you,\" said he, \"to consult with you about my\nCabinet. Here is a list of the gentlemen I intend to invite into it. You\nwill see that I have got you down for the Treasury. Will you look at the\nlist and say what you think of it?\"\n\nRatcliffe took the paper, but laid it at once on the table without\nlooking at it. \"I can have no objection,\" said he, \"to any Cabinet you\nmay appoint, provided I am not included in it. My wish is to remain\nwhere I am. There I can serve your administration better than in the\nCabinet.\"\n\n\"Then you refuse?\" growled the President.\n\n\"By no means. I only decline to offer any advice or even to hear the\nnames of my proposed colleagues until it is decided that my services\nare necessary. If they are, I shall accept without caring with whom I\nserve.\"\n\nThe President glared at him with an uneasy look. What was to be done\nnext?\n\nHe wanted time to think, but Ratcliffe was there and must be disposed\nof. He involuntarily became more civil: \"Mr. Ratcliffe, your refusal\nwould knock everything on the head. I thought that matter was all fixed.\nWhat more can I do?\"\n\nBut Ratcliffe had no mind to let the President out of his clutches so\neasily, and a long conversation followed, during which he forced his\nantagonist into the position of urging him to take the Treasury in order\nto prevent some undefined but portentous mischief in the Senate. All\nthat could be agreed upon was that Ratcliffe should give a positive\nanswer within two days, and on that agreement he took his leave.\n\nAs he passed through the corridor, a number of gentlemen were waiting\nfor interviews with the President, and among them was the whole\nPennsylvania delegation, \"ready for biz,\" as Mr. Tom Lord remarked, with\na wink.\n\nRatcliffe drew Krebs aside and they exchanged a few words as he passed\nout.\n\nTen minutes afterwards the delegation was admitted, and some of its\nmembers were a little surprised to hear their spokesman, Senator Krebs,\npress with extreme earnestness and in their names, the appointment of\nJosiah B. Carson to a place in the Cabinet, when they had been given to\nunderstand that they came to recommend Jared Caldwell as postmaster\nof Philadelphia. But Pennsylvania is a great and virtuous State, whose\nrepresentatives have entire confidence in their chief. Not one of them\nso much as winked.\n\nThe dance of democracy round the President now began again with wilder\nenergy. Ratcliffe launched his last bolts. His two-days' delay was a\nmere cover for bringing new influences to bear. He needed no delay. He\nwanted no time for reflection. The President had undertaken to put\nhim on the horns of a dilemma; either to force him into a hostile and\ntreacherous Cabinet, or to throw on him the blame of a refusal and\na quarrel. He meant to embrace one of the horns and to impale the\nPresident on it, and he felt perfect confidence in his own success. He\nmeant to accept the Treasury and he was ready to back himself with a\nheavy wager to get the government entirely into his own hands within six\nweeks. His contempt for the Hoosier Stone-cutter was unbounded, and his\nconfidence in himself more absolute than ever.\n\nBusy as he was, the Senator made his appearance the next evening at Mrs.\n\nLee's, and finding her alone with Sybil, who was occupied with her\nown little devices, Ratcliffe told Madeleine the story of his week's\nexperience.\n\nHe did not dwell on his exploits. On the contrary he quite ignored those\nelaborate arrangements which had taken from the President his power of\nvolition. His picture presented himself; solitary and unprotected, in\nthe character of that honest beast who was invited to dine with the lion\nand saw that all the footmarks of his predecessors led into the lion's\ncave, and none away from it. He described in humorous detail his\ninterviews with the Indiana lion, and the particulars of the surfeit of\nlobster as given in the President's dialect; he even repeated to her the\nstory told him by Mr. Tom Lord, without omitting oaths or gestures; he\ntold her how matters stood at the moment, and how the President had laid\na trap for him which he could not escape; he must either enter a\nCabinet constructed on purpose to thwart him and with the certainty of\nignominious dismissal at the first opportunity, or he must refuse an\noffer of friendship which would throw on him the blame of a quarrel, and\nenable the President to charge all future difficulties to the account\nof Ratcliffe's \"insatiable ambition.\" \"And now, Mrs. Lee,\" he continued,\nwith increasing seriousness of tone; \"I want your advice; what shall I\ndo?\"\n\nEven this half revelation of the meanness which distorted politics; this\none-sided view of human nature in its naked deformity playing pranks\nwith the interests of forty million people, disgusted and depressed\nMadeleine's mind. Ratclife spared her nothing except the exposure of\nhis own moral sores. He carefully called her attention to every leprous\ntaint upon his neighbours' persons, to every rag in their foul clothing,\nto every slimy and fetid pool that lay beside their path. It was his way\nof bringing his own qualities into relief. He meant that she should go\nhand in hand with him through the brimstone lake, and the more repulsive\nit seemed to her, the more overwhelming would his superiority become. He\nmeant to destroy those doubts of his character which Carrington was so\ncarefully fostering, to rouse her sympathy, to stimulate her feminine\nsense of self-sacrifice.\n\nWhen he asked this question she looked up at him with an expression of\nindignant pride, as she spoke:\n\n\"I say again, Mr. Ratcliffe, what I said once before. Do whatever is\nmost for the public good.\"\n\n\"And what is most for the public good?\"\n\nMadeleine half opened her mouth to reply, then hesitated, and stared\nsilently into the fire before her. What was indeed most for the public\ngood?\n\nWhere did the public good enter at all into this maze of personal\nintrigue, this wilderness of stunted natures where no straight road\nwas to be found, but only the tortuous and aimless tracks of beasts and\nthings that crawl?\n\nWhere was she to look for a principle to guide, an ideal to set up and\nto point at?\n\nRatcliffe resumed his appeal, and his manner was more serious than ever.\n\n\"I am hard pressed, Mrs. Lee. My enemies encompass me about. They mean\nto ruin me. I honestly wish to do my duty. You once said that personal\nconsiderations should have no weight. Very well! throw them away! And\nnow tell me what I should do.\"\n\nFor the first time, Mrs. Lee began to feel his power. He was simple,\nstraightforward, earnest. His words moved her. How should she imagine\nthat he was playing upon her sensitive nature precisely as he played\nupon the President's coarse one, and that this heavy western politician\nhad the instincts of a wild Indian in their sharpness and quickness of\nperception; that he divined her character and read it as he read the\nfaces and tones of thousands from day to day? She was uneasy under his\neye. She began a sentence, hesitated in the middle, and broke down. She\nlost her command of thought, and sat dumb-founded. He had to draw her\nout of the confusion he had himself made.\n\n\"I see your meaning in your face. You say that I should accept the duty\nand disregard the consequences.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Madeleine, hesitatingly; \"Yes, I think that would\nbe my feeling.\"\n\n\"And when I fall a sacrifice to that man's envy and intrigue, what will\nyou think then, Mrs. Lee? Will you not join the rest of the world and\nsay that I overreached myself; and walked into this trap with my eyes\nopen, and for my own objects? Do you think I shall ever be thought\nbetter of; for getting caught here? I don't parade high moral views like\nour friend French. I won't cant about virtue. But I do claim that in\nmy public life I have tried to do right. Will you do me the justice to\nthink so?\"\n\nMadeleine still struggled to prevent herself from being drawn into\nindefinite promises of sympathy with this man. She would keep him at\narm's length whatever her sympathies might be. She would not pledge\nherself to espouse his cause. She turned upon him with an effort, and\nsaid that her thoughts, now or at any time, were folly and nonsense, and\nthat the consciousness of right-doing was the only reward any public man\nhad a right to expect.\n\n\"And yet you are a hard critic, Mrs. Lee. If your thoughts are what\nyou say, your words are not. You judge with the judgment of abstract\nprinciples, and you wield the bolts of divine justice. You look on and\ncondemn, but you refuse to acquit. When I come to you on the verge of\nwhat is likely to be the fatal plunge of my life, and ask you only for\nsome clue to the moral principle that ought to guide me, you look on and\nsay that virtue is its own reward. And you do not even say where virtue\nlies.\"\n\n\"I confess my sins,\" said Madeleine, meekly and despondently; \"life is\nmore complicated than I thought.\"\n\n\"I shall be guided by your advice,\" said Ratcliffe; \"I shall walk into\nthat den of wild beasts, since you think I ought. But I shall hold you\nto your responsibility. You cannot refuse to see me through dangers you\nhave helped to bring me into.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Madeleine, earnestly; \"no responsibility. You ask more\nthan I can give.\"\n\nRatcliffe looked at her a moment with a troubled and careworn face. His\neyes seemed deep sunk in their dark circles, and his voice was pathetic\nin its intensity. \"Duty is duty, for you as well as for me. I have a\nright to the help of all pure minds. You have no right to refuse it. How\ncan you reject your own responsibility and hold me to mine?\"\n\nAlmost as he spoke, he rose and took his departure, leaving her no time\nto do more than murmur again her ineffectual protest. After he was gone,\nMrs.\n\nLee sat long, with her eyes fixed on the fire, reflecting upon what he\nhad said. Her mind was bewildered by the new suggestions which Ratcliffe\nhad thrown out. What woman of thirty, with aspirations for the infinite,\ncould resist an attack like this? What woman with a soul could see\nbefore her the most powerful public man of her time, appealing--with\na face furrowed by anxieties, and a voice vibrating with only\nhalf-suppressed affection--to her for counsel and sympathy, without\nyielding some response? and what woman could have helped bowing her head\nto that rebuke of her over-confident judgment, coming as it did from one\nwho in the same breath appealed to that judgment as final? Ratcliffe,\ntoo, had a curious instinct for human weaknesses. No magnetic needle\nwas ever truer than his finger when he touched the vulnerable spot in\nan opponent's mind. Mrs. Lee was not to be reached by an appeal to\nreligious sentiment, to ambition, or to affection.\n\nAny such appeal would have fallen flat on her ears and destroyed its own\nhopes. But she was a woman to the very last drop of her blood. She\ncould not be induced to love Ratcliffe, but she might be deluded into\nsacrificing herself for him. She atoned for want of devotion to God, by\ndevotion to man.\n\nShe had a woman's natural tendency towards asceticism, self-extinction,\nself-abnegation. All through life she had made painful efforts to\nunderstand and follow out her duty. Ratcliffe knew her weak point when\nhe attacked her from this side. Like all great orators and advocates, he\nwas an actor; the more effective because of a certain dignified air that\nforbade familiarity.\n\nHe had appealed to her sympathy, her sense of right and of duty, to her\ncourage, her loyalty, her whole higher nature; and while he made this\nappeal he felt more than half convinced that he was all he pretended to\nbe, and that he really had a right to her devotion. What wonder that she\nin her turn was more than half inclined to admit that right. She knew\nhim now better than Carrington or Jacobi knew him. Surely a man who\nspoke as he spoke, had noble instincts and lofty aims? Was not his\ncareer a thousand times more important than hers? If he, in his\nisolation and his cares, needed her assistance, had she an excuse for\nrefusing it? What was there in her aimless and useless life which made\nit so precious that she could not afford to fling it into the gutter, if\nneed be, on the bare chance of enriching some fuller existence?\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nOF all titles ever assumed by prince or potentate, the proudest is that\nof the Roman pontiffs: \"Servus servorum Dei\"--\"Servant of the servants\nof God.\"\n\nIn former days it was not admitted that the devil's servants could by\nright have any share in government. They were to be shut out, punished,\nexiled, maimed, and burned. The devil has no servants now; only the\npeople have servants. There may be some mistake about a doctrine which\nmakes the wicked, when a majority, the mouthpiece of God against the\nvirtuous, but the hopes of mankind are staked on it; and if the weak\nin faith sometimes quail when they see humanity floating in a shoreless\nocean, on this plank, which experience and religion long since condemned\nas rotten, mistake or not, men have thus far floated better by its aid,\nthan the popes ever did with their prettier principle; so that it will\nbe a long time yet before society repents.\n\nWhether the new President and his chief rival, Mr. Silas P. Ratcliffe,\nwere or were not servants of the servants of God, is not material\nhere. Servants they were to some one. No doubt many of those who call\nthemselves servants of the people are no better than wolves in sheep's\nclothing, or asses in lions' skins. One may see scores of them any day\nin the Capitol when Congress is in session, making noisy demonstrations,\nor more usefully doing nothing. A wiser generation will employ them in\nmanual labour; as it is, they serve only themselves. But there are\ntwo officers, at least, whose service is real--the President and his\nSecretary of the Treasury. The Hoosier Quarryman had not been a week\nin Washington before he was heartily home-sick for Indiana. No\nmaid-of-all-work in a cheap boarding-house was ever more harassed.\nEveryone conspired against him. His enemies gave him no peace. All\nWashington was laughing at his blunders, and ribald sheets, published\non a Sunday, took delight in printing the new Chief Magistrate's sayings\nand doings, chronicled with outrageous humour, and placed by malicious\nhands where the President could not but see them. He was sensitive to\nridicule, and it mortified him to the heart to find that remarks and\nacts, which to him seemed sensible enough, should be capable of such\nperversion. Then he was overwhelmed with public business. It came upon\nhim in a deluge, and he now, in his despair, no longer tried to control\nit. He let it pass over him like a wave. His mind was muddied by the\ninnumerable visitors to whom he had to listen. But his greatest anxiety\nwas the Inaugural Address which, distracted as he was, he could not\nfinish, although in another week it must be delivered. He was nervous\nabout his Cabinet; it seemed to him that he could do nothing until he\nhad disposed of Ratcliffe.\n\nAlready, thanks to the President's friends, Ratcliffe had become\nindispensable; still an enemy, of course, but one whose hands must be\ntied; a sort of Sampson, to be kept in bonds until the time came for\nputting him out of the way, but in the meanwhile, to be utilized. This\npoint being settled, the President had in imagination begun to lean upon\nhim; for the last few days he had postponed everything till next week,\n\"when I get my Cabinet arranged;\" which meant, when he got Ratcliffe's\nassistance; and he fell into a panic whenever he thought of the chance\nthat Ratcliffe might refuse.\n\nHe was pacing his room impatiently on Monday morning, an hour before\nthe time fixed for Ratcliffe's visit. His feelings still fluctuated\nviolently, and if he recognized the necessity of using Ratcliffe, he\nwas not the less determined to tie Ratcliffe's hands. He must be made\nto come into a Cabinet where every other voice would be against him. He\nmust be prevented from having any patronage to dispose of. He must be\ninduced to accept these conditions at the start. How present this to him\nin such a way as not to repel him at once? All this was needless, if\nthe President had only known it, but he thought himself a profound\nstatesman, and that his hand was guiding the destinies of America to his\nown re-election. When at length, on the stroke of ten o'clock, Ratcliffe\nentered the room, the President turned to him with nervous eagerness,\nand almost before offering his hand, said that he hoped Mr. Ratcliffe\nhad come prepared to begin work at once. The Senator replied that,\nif such was the President's decided wish, he would offer no further\nopposition. Then the President drew himself up in the attitude of an\nAmerican Cato, and delivered a prepared address, in which he said that\nhe had chosen the members of his Cabinet with a careful regard to the\npublic interests; that Mr. Ratcliffe was essential to the combination;\nthat he expected no disagreement on principles, for there was but one\nprinciple which he should consider fundamental, namely, that there\nshould be no removals from office except for cause; and that under these\ncircumstances he counted upon Mr. Ratcliffe's assistance as a matter of\npatriotic duty.\n\nTo all this Ratcliffe assented without a word of objection, and the\nPresident, more convinced than ever of his own masterly statesmanship,\nbreathed more freely than for a week past. Within ten minutes they\nwere actively at work together, clearing away the mass of accumulated\nbusiness.\n\nThe relief of the Quarryman surprised himself. Ratcliffe lifted the\nweight of affairs from his shoulders with hardly an effort. He knew\neverybody and everything. He took most of the President's visitors at\nonce into his own hands and dismissed them with great rapidity. He knew\nwhat they wanted; he knew what recommendations were strong and what were\nweak; who was to be treated with deference and who was to be sent\naway abruptly; where a blunt refusal was safe, and where a pledge was\nallowable. The President even trusted him with the unfinished manuscript\nof the Inaugural Address, which Ratcliffe returned to him the next\nday with such notes and suggestions as left nothing to be done beyond\ncopying them out in a fair hand. With all this, he proved himself a very\nagreeable companion. He talked well and enlivened the work; he was not a\nhard taskmaster, and when he saw that the President was tired, he boldly\nasserted that there was no more business that could not as well wait\na day, and so took the weary Stone-cutter out to drive for a couple of\nhours, and let him go peacefully to sleep in the carriage. They dined\ntogether and Ratcliffe took care to send for Tom Lord to amuse them, for\nTom was a wit and a humourist, and kept the President in a laugh. Mr.\nLord ordered the dinner and chose the wines. He could be coarse enough\nto suit even the President's palate, and Ratcliffe was not behindhand.\nWhen the new Secretary went away at ten o'clock that night, his chief;\nwho was in high good humour with his dinner, his champagne, and his\nconversation, swore with some unnecessary granite oaths, that Ratcliffe\nwas \"a clever fellow anyhow,\" and he was glad \"that job was fixed.\"\n\nThe truth was that Ratcliffe had now precisely ten days before the new\nCabinet could be set in motion, and in these ten days he must establish\nhis authority over the President so firmly that nothing could shake it.\nHe was diligent in good works. Very soon the court began to feel his\nhand. If a business letter or a written memorial came in, the President\nfound it easy to endorse: \"Referred to the Secretary of the Treasury.\"\nIf a visitor wanted anything for himself or another, the invariable\nreply came to be: \"Just mention it to Mr. Ratcliffe;\" or, \"I guess\nRatcliffe will see to that.\"\n\nBefore long he even made jokes in a Catonian manner; jokes that were not\npeculiarly witty, but somewhat gruff and boorish, yet significant of a\nresigned and self-contented mind. One morning he ordered Ratcliffe to\ntake an iron-clad ship of war and attack the Sioux in Montana, seeing\nthat he was in charge of the army and navy and Indians at once, and\nJack of all trades; and again he told a naval officer who wanted a\ncourt-martial that he had better get Ratcliffe to sit on him for he was\na whole court-martial by himself. That Ratcliffe held his chief in no\nless contempt than before, was probable but not certain, for he kept\nsilence on the subject before the world, and looked solemn whenever the\nPresident was mentioned.\n\nBefore three days were over, the President, with a little more than\nhis usual abruptness, suddenly asked him what he knew about this\nfellow Carson, whom the Pennsylvanians were bothering him to put in his\nCabinet. Ratcliffe was guarded: he scarcely knew the man; Mr. Carson\nwas not in politics, he believed, but was pretty respectable--for a\nPennsylvanian. The President returned to the subject several times; got\nout his list of Cabinet officers and figured industriously upon it with\na rather perplexed face; called Ratcliffe to help him; and at last\nthe \"slate\" was fairly broken, and Ratcliffe's eyes gleamed when the\nPresident caused his list of nominations to be sent to the Senate on the\n5th March, and Josiah B. Carson, of Pennsylvania, was promptly confirmed\nas Secretary of the Interior.\n\nBut his eyes gleamed still more humorously when, a few days afterwards,\nthe President gave him a long list of some two score names, and asked\nhim to find places for them. He assented good-naturedly, with a remark\nthat it might be necessary to make a few removals to provide for these\ncases.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said the President, \"I guess there's just about as many as\nthat had ought to go out anyway. These are friends of mine; got to be\nlooked after. Just stuff 'em in somewhere.\"\n\nEven he felt a little awkward about it, and, to do him justice, this\nwas the last that was heard about the fundamental rule of his\nadministration.\n\nRemovals were fast and furious, until all Indiana became easy in\ncircumstances. And it was not to be denied that, by one means or\nanother, Ratcliffe's friends did come into their fair share of the\npublic money.\n\nPerhaps the President thought it best to wink at such use of the\nTreasury patronage for the present, or was already a little overawed by\nhis Secretary.\n\nRatcliffe's work was done. The public had, with the help of some\nclever intrigue, driven its servants into the traces. Even an Indiana\nstone-cutter could be taught that his personal prejudices must yield to\nthe public service. What mischief the selfishness, the ambition, or\nthe ignorance of these men might do, was another matter. As the affair\nstood, the President was the victim of his own schemes. It remained to\nbe seen whether, at some future day, Mr. Ratcliffe would think it worth\nhis while to strangle his chief by some quiet Eastern intrigue, but\nthe time had gone by when the President could make use of either the\nbow-string or the axe upon him.\n\nAll this passed while Mrs. Lee was quietly puzzling her poor little\nbrain about her duty and her responsibility to Ratcliffe, who,\nmeanwhile, rarely failed to find himself on Sunday evenings by her side\nin her parlour, where his rights were now so well established that no\none presumed to contest his seat, unless it were old Jacobi, who from\ntime to time reminded him that he was fallible and mortal. Occasionally,\nthough not often, Mr. Ratcliffe came at other times, as when he\npersuaded Mrs. Lee to be present at the Inauguration, and to call on the\nPresident's wife. Madeleine and Sybil went to the Capitol and had the\nbest places to see and hear the Inauguration, as well as a cold March\nwind would allow. Mrs. Lee found fault with the ceremony; it was of\nthe earth, earthy, she said. An elderly western farmer, with silver\nspectacles, new and glossy evening clothes, bony features, and stiff;\nthin, gray hair, trying to address a large crowd of people, under the\ndrawbacks of a piercing wind and a cold in his head, was not a hero.\nSybil's mind was lost in wondering whether the President would not soon\ndie of pneumonia. Even this experience, however, was happy when compared\nwith that of the call upon the President's wife, after which Madeleine\ndecided to leave the new dynasty alone in future. The lady, who was\nsomewhat stout and coarse-featured, and whom Mrs. Lee declared she\nwouldn't engage as a cook, showed qualities which, seen under that\nfierce light which beats upon a throne, seemed ungracious. Her antipathy\nto Ratcliffe was more violent than her husband's, and was even more\nopenly expressed, until the President was quite put out of countenance\nby it. She extended her hostility to every one who could be supposed to\nbe Ratcliffe's friend, and the newspapers, as well as private gossip,\nhad marked out Mrs. Lee as one who, by an alliance with Ratcliffe, was\naiming at supplanting her own rule over the White House.\n\nHence, when Mrs. Lightfoot Lee was announced, and the two sisters were\nushered into the presidential parlour, she put on a coldly patronizing\nair, and in reply to Madeleine's hope that she found Washington\nagreeable, she intimated that there was much in Washington which struck\nher as awful wicked, especially the women; and, looking at Sybil, she\nspoke of the style of dress in this city which she said she meant to do\nwhat she could to put a stop to. She'd heard tell that people sent to\nParis for their gowns, just as though America wasn't good enough to make\none's clothes! Jacob (all Presidents' wives speak of their husbands by\ntheir first names) had promised her to get a law passed against it. In\nher town in Indiana, a young woman who was seen on the street in such\nclothes wouldn't be spoken to. At these remarks, made with an air and\nin a temper quite unmistakable, Madeleine became exasperated beyond\nmeasure, and said that \"Washington would be pleased to see the President\ndo something in regard to dress-reform--or any other reform;\" and with\nthis allusion to the President's ante-election reform speeches, Mrs. Lee\nturned her back and left the room, followed by Sybil in convulsions of\nsuppressed laughter, which would not have been suppressed had she seen\nthe face of their hostess as the door shut behind them, and the energy\nwith which she shook her head and said: \"See if I don't reform you yet,\nyou--jade!\"\n\nMrs. Lee gave Ratcliffe a lively account of this interview, and he\nlaughed nearly as convulsively as Sybil over it, though he tried to\npacify her by saying that the President's most intimate friends openly\ndeclared his wife to be insane, and that he himself was the person most\nafraid of her. But Mrs. Lee declared that the President was as bad as\nhis wife; that an equally good President and President's wife could be\npicked up in any corner-grocery between the Lakes and the Ohio; and\nthat no inducement should ever make her go near that coarse washerwoman\nagain.\n\nRatcliffe did not attempt to change Mrs. Lee's opinion. Indeed he\nknew better than any man how Presidents were made, and he had his\nown opinions in regard to the process as well as the fabric produced.\nNothing Mrs. Lee could say now affected him. He threw off his\nresponsibility and she found it suddenly resting on her own shoulders.\nWhen she spoke with indignation of the wholesale removals from office\nwith which the new administration marked its advent to power, he told\nher the story of the President's fundamental principle, and asked her\nwhat she would have him do. \"He meant to tie my hands,\" said Ratcliffe,\n\"and to leave his own free, and I accepted the condition. Can I resign\nnow on such a ground as this?\" And Madeleine was obliged to agree that\nhe could not. She had no means of knowing how many removals he made in\nhis own interest, or how far he had outwitted the President at his own\ngame. He stood before her a victim and a patriot. Every step he had\ntaken had been taken with her approval. He was now in office to prevent\nwhat evil he could, not to be responsible for the evil that was done;\nand he honestly assured her that much worse men would come in when he\nwent out, as the President would certainly take good care that he did go\nout when the moment arrived.\n\nMrs. Lee had the chance now to carry out her scheme in coming to\nWashington, for she was already deep in the mire of politics and\ncould see with every advantage how the great machine floundered about,\nbespattering with mud even her own pure garments. Ratcliffe himself,\nsince entering the Treasury, had begun to talk with a sneer of the way\nin which laws were made, and openly said that he wondered how government\ngot on at all. Yet he declared still that this particular government was\nthe highest expression of political thought. Mrs. Lee stared at him and\nwondered whether he knew what thought was. To her the government seemed\nto have less thought in it than one of Sybil's gowns, for if they, like\nthe government, were monstrously costly, they were at least adapted to\ntheir purpose, the parts fitted together, and they were neither awkward\nnor unwieldy.\n\nThere was nothing very encouraging in all this, but it was better than\nNew York. At least it gave her something to look at, and to think about.\nEven Lord Dunbeg preached practical philanthropy to her by the hour.\nRatcliffe, too, was compelled to drag himself out of the rut of machine\npolitics, and to justify his right of admission to her house. There Mr.\nFrench discoursed at great length, until the fourth of March sent him\nhome to Connecticut; and he brought more than one intelligent member\nof Congress to Mrs. Lee's parlour. Underneath the scum floating on the\nsurface of politics, Madeleine felt that there was a sort of healthy\nocean current of honest purpose, which swept the scum before it, and\nkept the mass pure.\n\nThis was enough to draw her on. She reconciled herself to accepting\nthe Ratcliffian morals, for she could see no choice. She herself had\napproved every step she had seen him take. She could not deny that there\nmust be something wrong in a double standard of morality, but where was\nit? Mr.\n\nRatcliffe seemed to her to be doing good work with as pure means as he\nhad at hand. He ought to be encouraged, not reviled. What was she that\nshe should stand in judgment?\n\nOthers watched her progress with less satisfaction. Mr. Nathan Gore was\none of these, for he came in one evening, looking much out of temper,\nand, sitting down by her side he said he had come to bid good-bye and to\nthank her for the kindness she had shown him; he was to leave Washington\nthe next morning. She too expressed her warm regret, but added that she\nhoped he was only going in order to take his passage to Madrid.\n\nHe shook his head. \"I am going to take my passage,\" said he, \"but not to\nMadrid. The fates have cut that thread. The President does not want my\nservices, and I can't blame him, for if our situations were reversed, I\nshould certainly not want his. He has an Indiana friend, who, I am told,\nwanted to be postmaster at Indianapolis, but as this did not suit the\npoliticians, he was bought off at the exorbitant price of the Spanish\nmission. But I should have no chance even if he were out of the way. The\nPresident does not approve of me. He objects to the cut of my overcoat\nwhich is unfortunately an English one. He also objects to the cut of my\nhair. I am afraid that his wife objects to me because I am so happy as\nto be thought a friend of yours.\"\n\nMadeleine could only acknowledge that Mr. Gore's case was a bad one.\n\"But after all,\" said she, \"why should politicians be expected to love\nyou literary gentlemen who write history. Other criminal classes are not\nexpected to love their judges.\"\n\n\"No, but they have sense enough to fear them,\" replied Gore\nvindictively; \"not one politician living has the brains or the art to\ndefend his own cause. The ocean of history is foul with the carcases of\nsuch statesmen, dead and forgotten except when some historian fishes one\nof them up to gibbet it.\"\n\nMr. Gore was so much out of temper that after this piece of extravagance\nhe was forced to pause a moment to recover himself. Then he went\non:--\"You are perfectly right, and so is the President. I have no\nbusiness to be meddling in politics. It is not my place. The next time\nyou hear of me, I promise it shall not be as an office-seeker.\"\n\nThen he rapidly changed the subject, saying that he hoped Mrs. Lee was\nsoon going northward again, and that they might meet at Newport.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Madeleine; \"the spring is pleasant here, and we\nshall stay till the warm weather, I think.\"\n\nMr. Gore looked grave. \"And your politics!\" said he; \"are you satisfied\nwith what you have seen?\"\n\n\"I have got so far as to lose the distinction between right and wrong.\nIsn't that the first step in politics?\"\n\nMr. Gore had no mind even for serious jesting. He broke out into a long\nlecture which sounded like a chapter of some future history: \"But Mrs.\nLee, is it possible that you don't see what a wrong path you are on.\nIf you want to know what the world is really doing to any good purpose,\npass a winter at Samarcand, at Timbuctoo, but not at Washington. Be a\nbank-clerk, or a journeyman printer, but not a Congressman. Here you\nwill find nothing but wasted effort and clumsy intrigue.\"\n\n\"Do you think it a pity for me to learn that?\" asked Madeleine when his\nlong essay was ended.\n\n\"No!\" replied Gore, hesitating; \"not if you do learn it. But many people\nnever get so far, or only when too late. I shall be glad to hear\nthat you are mistress of it and have given up reforming politics. The\nSpaniards have a proverb that smells of the stable, but applies to\npeople like you and me: The man who washes his donkey's head, loses time\nand soap.\"\n\nGore took his leave before Madeleine had time to grasp all the impudence\nof this last speech. Not until she was fairly in bed that night did it\nsuddenly flash on her mind that Mr. Gore had dared to caricature her as\nwasting time and soap on Mr. Ratcliffe. At first she was violently\nangry and then she laughed in spite of herself; there was truth in the\nportrait. In secret, too, she was the less offended because she half\nthought that it had depended only on herself to make of Mr. Gore\nsomething more than a friend. If she had overheard his parting words to\nCarrington, she would have had still more reason to think that a little\njealousy of Ratcliffe's success sharpened the barb of Gore's enmity.\n\n\"Take care of Ratcliffe!\" was his farewell; \"he is a clever dog. He has\nset his mark on Mrs. Lee. Look out that he doesn't walk off with her!\"\n\nA little startled by this sudden confidence, Carrington could only ask\nwhat he could do to prevent it.\n\n\"Cats that go ratting, don't wear gloves,\" replied Gore, who always\ncarried a Spanish proverb in his pocket. Carrington, after painful\nreflection, could only guess that he wanted Ratcliffe's enemies to show\ntheir claws. But how?\n\nMrs. Lee not long afterwards spoke to Ratcliffe of her regret at Gore's\ndisappointment and hinted at his disgust. Ratcliffe replied that he had\ndone what he could for Gore, and had introduced him to the President,\nwho, after seeing him, had sworn his usual granitic oath that he would\nsooner send his nigger farm-hand Jake to Spain than that man-milliner.\n\"You know how I stand;\" added Ratcliffe; \"what more could I do?\" And\nMrs. Lee's implied reproach was silenced.\n\nIf Gore was little pleased with Ratcliffe's conduct, poor Schneidekoupon\nwas still less so. He turned up again at Washington not long after\nthe Inauguration and had a private interview with the Secretary of the\nTreasury.\n\nWhat passed at it was known only to themselves, but, whatever it\nwas, Schneidekoupon's temper was none the better for it. From his\nconversations with Sybil, it seemed that there was some question about\nappointments in which his protectionist friends were interested, and he\ntalked very openly about Ratcliffe's want of good faith, and how he had\npromised everything to everybody and had failed to keep a single pledge;\nif Schneidekoupon's advice had been taken, this wouldn't have happened.\nMrs. Lee told Ratcliffe that Schneidekoupon seemed out of temper, and\nasked the reason. He only laughed and evaded the question, remarking\nthat cattle of this kind were always complaining unless they were\nallowed to run the whole government; Schneidekoupon had nothing\nto grumble about; no one had ever made any promises to him. But\nnevertheless Schneidekoupon confided to Sybil his antipathy to Ratcliffe\nand solemnly begged her not to let Mrs. Lee fall into his hands, to\nwhich Sybil answered tartly that she only wished Mr.\n\nSchneidekoupon would tell her how to help it.\n\nThe reformer French had also been one of Ratcliffe's backers in the\nfight over the Treasury. He remained in Washington a few days after the\nInauguration, and then disappeared, leaving cards with P.P.C. in the\ncorner, at Mrs. Lee's door. Rumour said that he too was disappointed,\nbut he kept his own counsel, and, if he really wanted the mission\nto Belgium, he contented himself with waiting for it. A respectable\nstage-coach proprietor from Oregon got the place.\n\nAs for Jacobi, who was not disappointed, and who had nothing to ask\nfor, he was bitterest of all. He formally offered his congratulations to\nRatcliffe on his appointment. This little scene occurred in Mrs.\nLee's parlour. The old Baron, with his most suave manner, and his most\nVoltairean leer, said that in all his experience, and he had seen a\ngreat many court intrigues, he had never seen anything better managed\nthan that about the Treasury.\n\nRatcliffe was furiously angry, and told the Baron outright that foreign\nministers who insulted the governments to which they were accredited ran\na risk of being sent home.\n\n\"Ce serait toujours un pis aller,\" said Jacobi, seating himself with\ncalmness in Ratcliffe's favourite chair by Mrs. Lee's side.\n\nMadeleine, alarmed as she was, could not help interposing, and hastily\nasked whether that remark was translatable.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Baron; \"I can do nothing with your language. You would\nonly say that it was a choice of evils, to go, or to stay.\"\n\n\"We might translate it by saying: 'One may go farther and fare worse,'\"\nrejoined Madeleine; and so the storm blew over for the time, and\nRatcliffe sulkily let the subject drop. Nevertheless the two men never\nmet in Mrs.\n\nLee's parlour without her dreading a personal altercation. Little by\nlittle, what with Jacobi's sarcasms and Ratcliffe's roughness, they\nnearly ceased to speak, and glared at each other like quarrelsome dogs.\nMadeleine was driven to all kinds of expedients to keep the peace, yet\nat the same time she could not but be greatly amused by their behaviour,\nand as their hatred of each other only stimulated their devotion to her,\nshe was content to hold an even balance between them.\n\nNor were these all the awkward consequences of Ratcliffe's attentions.\nNow that he was distinctly recognized as an intimate friend of Mrs.\nLee's, and possibly her future husband, no one ventured any longer to\nattack him in her presence, but nevertheless she was conscious in a\nthousand ways that the atmosphere became more and more dense under\nthe shadow of the Secretary of the Treasury. In spite of herself she\nsometimes felt uneasy, as though there were conspiracy in the air. One\nMarch afternoon she was sitting by her fire, with an English Review in\nher hand, trying to read the last Symposium on the sympathies of Eternal\nPunishment, when her servant brought in a card, and Mrs. Lee had barely\ntime to read the name of Mrs. Samuel Baker when that lady followed the\nservant into the room, forcing the countersign in so effective style\nthat for once Madeleine was fairly disconcerted. Her manner when thus\nintruded upon, was cool, but in this case, on Carrington's account, she\ntried to smile courteously and asked her visitor to sit down, which Mrs.\nBaker was doing without an invitation, very soon putting her hostess\nentirely at her ease. She was, when seen without her veil, a showy woman\nverging on forty, decidedly large, tall, over-dressed even in mourning,\nand with a complexion rather fresher than nature had made it.\n\nThere was a geniality in her address, savouring of easy Washington ways,\na fruitiness of smile, and a rich southern accent, that explained on\nthe spot her success in the lobby. She looked about her with fine\nself-possession, and approved Mrs. Lee's surroundings with a cordiality\nso different from the northern stinginess of praise, that Madeleine\nwas rather pleased than offended. Yet when her eye rested on the Corot,\nMadeleine's only pride, she was evidently perplexed, and resorted to\neye-glasses, in order, as it seemed, to gain time for reflection. But\nshe was not to be disconcerted even by Corot's masterpiece:\n\n\"How pretty! Japanese, isn't it? Sea-weeds seen through a fog. I went to\nan auction yesterday, and do you know I bought a tea-pot with a picture\njust like that.\"\n\nMadeleine inquired with extreme interest about the auction, but after\nlearning all that Mrs. Baker had to tell, she was on the point of being\nreduced to silence, when she bethought herself to mention Carrington.\nMrs.\n\nBaker brightened up at once, if she could be said to brighten where\nthere was no sign of dimness:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Carrington! Isn't he sweet? I think he's a delicious man. I\ndon't know what I should do without him. Since poor Mr. Baker left\nme, we have been together all the time. You know my poor husband left\ndirections that all his papers should be burned, and though I would not\nsay so unless you were such a friend of Mr. Carrington's, I reckon it's\njust as well for some people that he did. I never could tell you what\nquantities of papers Mr. Carrington and I have put in the fire; and we\nread them all too.\"\n\nMadeleine asked whether this was not dull work.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! You see I know all about it, and told Mr. Carrington the\nstory of every paper as we went on. It was quite amusing, I assure you.\"\n\nMrs. Lee then boldly said she had got from Mr. Carrington an idea that\nMrs.\n\nBaker was a very skilful diplomatist.\n\n\"Diplomatist!\" echoed the widow with her genial laugh; \"Well! it was as\nmuch that as anything, but there's not many diplomatists' wives in this\ncity ever did as much work as I used to do. Why, I knew half the members\nof Congress intimately, and all of them by sight. I knew where they came\nfrom and what they liked best. I could get round the greater part of\nthem, sooner or later.\"\n\nMrs. Lee asked what she did with all this knowledge. Mrs. Baker shook\nher pink-and-white countenance, and almost paralysed her opposite\nneighbour by a sort of Grande Duchesse wink:\n\n\"Oh, my dear! you are new here. If you had seen Washington in war-times\nand for a few years afterwards, you wouldn't ask that. We had more\ncongressional business than all the other agents put together. Every one\ncame to us then, to get his bill through, or his appropriation watched.\nWe were hard at work all the time. You see, one can't keep the run of\nthree hundred men without some trouble. My husband used to make lists\nof them in books with a history of each man and all he could learn about\nhim, but I carried it all in my head.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you could get them all to vote as you pleased?\" asked\nMadeleine.\n\n\"Well! we got our bills through,\" replied Mrs. Baker.\n\n\"But how did you do it? did they take bribes?\"\n\n\"Some of them did. Some of them liked suppers and cards and theatres\nand all sorts of things. Some of them could be led, and some had to be\ndriven like Paddy's pig who thought he was going the other way. Some\nof them had wives who could talk to them, and some--hadn't,\" said Mrs.\nBaker, with a queer intonation in her abrupt ending.\n\n\"But surely,\" said Mrs. Lee, \"many of them must have been above--I mean,\nthey must have had nothing to get hold of; so that you could manage\nthem.\"\n\nMrs. Baker laughed cheerfully and remarked that they were very much of a\nmuchness.\n\n\"But I can't understand how you did it,\" urged Madeleine; \"now, how\nwould you have gone to work to get a respectable senator's vote--a man\nlike Mr. Ratcliffe, for instance?\"\n\n\"Ratcliffe!\" repeated Mrs. Baker with a slight elevation of voice that\ngave way to a patronising laugh. \"Oh, my dear! don't mention names.\nI should get into trouble. Senator Ratcliffe was a good friend of my\nhusband's. I guess Mr. Carrington could have told you that. But you see,\nwhat we generally wanted was all right enough. We had to know where\nour bills were, and jog people's elbows to get them reported in time.\nSometimes we had to convince them that our bill was a proper one, and\nthey ought to vote for it. Only now and then, when there was a great\ndeal of money and the vote was close, we had to find out what votes were\nworth. It was mostly dining and talking, calling them out into the lobby\nor asking them to supper. I wish I could tell you things I have seen,\nbut I don't dare. It wouldn't be safe. I've told you already more than\nI ever said to any one else; but then you are so intimate with Mr.\nCarrington, that I always think of you as an old friend.\"\n\nThus Mrs. Baker rippled on, while Mrs. Lee listened with more and more\ndoubt and disgust. The woman was showy, handsome in a coarse style, and\nperfectly presentable. Mrs. Lee had seen Duchesses as vulgar. She knew\nmore about the practical working of government than Mrs. Lee could\never expect or hope to know. Why then draw back from this interesting\nlobbyist with such babyish repulsion?\n\nWhen, after a long, and, as she declared, a most charming call, Mrs.\nBaker wended her way elsewhere and Madeleine had given the strictest\norder that she should never be admitted again, Carrington entered, and\nMadeleine showed him Mrs. Baker's card and gave a lively account of the\ninterview.\n\n\"What shall I do with the woman?\" she asked; \"must I return her card?\"\nBut Carrington declined to offer advice on this interesting point. \"And\nshe says that Mr. Ratcliffe was a friend of her husband's and that you\ncould tell me about that.\"\n\n\"Did she say so?\" remarked Carrington vaguely.\n\n\"Yes! and that she knew every one's weak points and could get all their\nvotes.\"\n\nCarrington expressed no surprise, and so evidently preferred to change\nthe subject, that Mrs. Lee desisted and said no more.\n\nBut she determined to try the same experiment on Mr. Ratcliffe, and\nchose the very next chance that offered. In her most indifferent manner\nshe remarked that Mrs. Sam Baker had called upon her and had initiated\nher into the mysteries of the lobby till she had become quite ambitious\nto start on that career.\n\n\"She said you were a friend of her husband's,\" added Madeleine softly.\n\nRatcliffe's face betrayed no sign.\n\n\"If you believe what those people tell you,\" said he drily, \"you will be\nwiser than the Queen of Sheba.\"\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nWHENEVER a man reaches the top of the political ladder, his enemies\nunite to pull him down. His friends become critical and exacting. Among\nthe many dangers of this sort which now threatened Ratcliffe, there was\none that, had he known it, might have made him more uneasy than any\nof those which were the work of senators and congressmen. Carrington\nentered into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with Sybil. It came\nabout in this wise. Sybil was fond of riding and occasionally, when\nCarrington could spare the time, he went as her guide and protector in\nthese country excursions; for every Virginian, however out at elbows,\nhas a horse, as he has shoes or a shirt.\n\nIn a thoughtless moment Carrington had been drawn into a promise that he\nwould take Sybil to Arlington. The promise was one that he did not hurry\nto keep, for there were reasons which made a visit to Arlington anything\nbut a pleasure to him; but Sybil would listen to no excuses, and so it\ncame about that, one lovely March morning, when the shrubs and the trees\nin the square before the house were just beginning, under the warmer\nsun, to show signs of their coming wantonness, Sybil stood at the open\nwindow waiting for him, while her new Kentucky horse before the door\nshowed what he thought of the delay by curving his neck, tossing his\nhead, and pawing the pavement.\n\nCarrington was late and kept her waiting so long, that the mignonette\nand geraniums, which adorned the window, suffered for his slowness,\nand the curtain tassels showed signs of wilful damage. Nevertheless he\narrived at length, and they set out together, choosing the streets\nleast enlivened by horse-cars and provision-carts, until they had crept\nthrough the great metropolis of Georgetown and come upon the bridge\nwhich crosses the noble river just where its bold banks open out to\nclasp the city of Washington in their easy embrace. Then reaching the\nVirginia side they cantered gaily up the laurel-margined road, with\nglimpses of woody defiles, each carrying its trickling stream and rich\nin promise of summer flowers, while from point to point they caught\nglorious glimpses of the distant city and river. They passed the small\nmilitary station on the heights, still dignified by the name of\nfort, though Sybil silently wondered how a fort was possible without\nfortifications, and complained that there was nothing more warlike than\na \"nursery of telegraph poles.\" The day was blue and gold; everything\nsmiled and sparkled in the crisp freshness of the morning. Sybil was\nin bounding spirits and not at all pleased to find that her companion\nbecame moody and abstracted as they went on. \"Poor Mr. Carrington!\"\nthought she to herself, \"he is so nice; but when he puts on that solemn\nair, one might as well go to sleep. I am quite certain no nice woman\nwill ever marry him if he looks like that;\" and her practical mind ran\noff among all the girls of her acquaintance, in search of one who would\nput up with Carrington's melancholy face. She knew his devotion to her\nsister, but had long ago rejected this as a hopeless chance. There was\na simplicity about Sybil's way of dealing with life, which had its\nown charm. She never troubled herself about the impossible or the\nunthinkable. She had feelings, and was rather quick in her sympathies\nand sorrows, but she was equally quick in getting over them, and she\nexpected other people to do likewise. Madeleine dissected her own\nfeelings and was always wondering whether they were real or not; she\nhad a habit of taking off her mental clothing, as she might take off a\ndress, and looking at it as though it belonged to some one else, and as\nthough sensations were manufactured like clothes. This seems to be one\nof the easier ways of deadening sorrow, as though the mind could\nteach itself to lop off its feelers. Sybil particularly disliked this\nself-inspection. In the first place she did not understand it, and in\nthe second her mind was all feelers, and amputation was death. She could\nno more analyse a feeling than doubt its existence, both which were\nhabits of her sister.\n\nHow was Sybil to know what was passing in Carrington's mind? He was\nthinking of nothing in which she supposed herself interested. He was\ntroubled with memories of civil war and of associations still earlier,\nbelonging to an age already vanishing or vanished; but what could she\nknow about civil war who had been almost an infant at the time? At this\nmoment, she happened to be interested in the baffle of Waterloo, for she\nwas reading \"Vanity Fair,\" and had cried as she ought for poor little\nEmmy, when her husband, George Osborne, lay dead on the field there,\nwith a bullet through his heart. But how was she to know that here, only\na few rods before her, lay scores and hundreds of George Osbornes, or\nhis betters, and in their graves the love and hope of many Emmys, not\ncreatures of the imagination, but flesh and blood, like herself? To her,\nthere was no more in those associations which made Carrington groan in\nthe silence of his thoughts, than if he had been old Kaspar, and she the\nlittle Wilhelmine. What was a skull more or less to her? What concern\nhad she in the famous victory?\n\nYet even Sybil was startled as she rode through the gate and found\nherself suddenly met by the long white ranks of head-stones, stretching\nup and down the hill-sides by thousands, in order of baffle; as though\nCadmus had reversed his myth, and had sown living men, to come up\ndragons' teeth. She drew in her horse with a shiver and a sudden impulse\nto cry. Here was something new to her. This was war--wounds, disease,\ndeath. She dropped her voice and with a look almost as serious as\nCarrington's, asked what all these graves meant. When Carrington told\nher, she began for the first time to catch some dim notion why his\nface was not quite as gay as her own. Even now this idea was not very\nprecise, for he said little about himself, but at least she grappled\nwith the fact that he had actually, year after year, carried arms\nagainst these men who lay at her feet and who had given their lives for\nher cause. It suddenly occurred to her as a new thought that perhaps\nhe himself might have killed one of them with his own hand. There was\na strange shock in this idea. She felt that Carrington was further from\nher. He gained dignity in his rebel isolation. She wanted to ask him\nhow he could have been a traitor, and she did not dare. Carrington a\ntraitor!\n\nCarrington killing her friends! The idea was too large to grasp. She\nfell back on the simpler task of wondering how he had looked in his\nrebel uniform.\n\nThey rode slowly round to the door of the house and dismounted, after\nhe had with some difficulty found a man to hold their horses. From the\nheavy brick porch they looked across the superb river to the raw and\nincoherent ugliness of the city, idealised into dreamy beauty by the\natmosphere, and the soft background of purple hills behind. Opposite\nthem, with its crude \"thus saith the law\" stamped on white dome and\nfortress-like walls, rose the Capitol.\n\nCarrington stood with her a short time while they looked at the view;\nthen said he would rather not go into the house himself, and sat down\non the steps while she strolled alone through the rooms. These were bare\nand gaunt, so that she, with her feminine sense of fitness, of course\nconsidered what she would do to make them habitable. She had a neat\nfancy for furniture, and distributed her tones and half tones and bits\nof colour freely about the walls and ceilings, with a high-backed\nchair here, a spindle-legged sofa there, and a claw-footed table in the\ncentre, until her eye was caught by a very dirty deal desk, on which\nstood an open book, with an inkstand and some pens. On the leaf she read\nthe last entry: \"Eli M. Grow and lady, Thermopyle Centre.\" Not even the\ngraves outside had brought the horrors of war so near.\n\nWhat a scourge it was! This respectable family turned out of such a\nlovely house, and all the pretty old furniture swept away before a horde\nof coarse invaders \"with ladies.\" Did the hosts of Attila write their\nnames on visiting books in the temple of Vesta and the house of Sallust?\nWhat a new terror they would have added to the name of the scourge of\nGod! Sybil returned to the portico and sat down by Carrington on the\nsteps.\n\n\"How awfully sad it is!\" said she; \"I suppose the house was prettily\nfurnished when the Lees lived here? Did you ever see it then?\"\n\nSybil was not very profound, but she had sympathy, and at this moment\nCarrington felt sorely in need of comfort. He wanted some one to share\nhis feelings, and he turned towards her hungry for companionship.\n\n\"The Lees were old family friends of mine,\" said he. \"I used to stay\nhere when I was a boy, even as late as the spring of 1861. The last time\nI sat here, it was with them. We were wild about disunion and talked of\nnothing else. I have been trying to recall what was said then. We\nnever thought there would be war, and as for coercion, it was nonsense.\nCoercion, indeed! The idea was ridiculous. I thought so, too, though I\nwas a Union man and did not want the State to go out. But though I felt\nsure that Virginia must suffer, I never thought we could be beaten. Yet\nnow I am sitting here a pardoned rebel, and the poor Lees are driven\naway and their place is a grave-yard.\"\n\nSybil became at once absorbed in the Lees and asked many questions, all\nwhich Carrington gladly answered. He told her how he had admired and\nfollowed General Lee through the war. \"We thought he was to be our\nWashington, you know; and perhaps he had some such idea himself;\" and\nthen, when Sybil wanted to hear about the baffles and the fighting, he\ndrew a rough map on the gravel path to show her how the two lines had\nrun, only a few miles away; then he told her how he had carried his\nmusket day after day over all this country, and where he had seen his\nbattles. Sybil had everything to learn; the story came to her with all\nthe animation of real life, for here under her eyes were the graves of\nher own champions, and by her side was a rebel who had stood under our\nfire at Malvern Hill and at South Mountain, and who was telling her how\nmen looked and what they thought in face of death. She listened with\nbreathless interest, and at last summoned courage to ask in an awestruck\ntone whether Carrington had ever killed any one himself. She was\nrelieved, although a little disappointed, when he said that he believed\nnot; he hoped not; though no private who has discharged a musket in\nbaffle can be quite sure where the bullet went. \"I never tried to kill\nany one,\" said he, \"though they tried to kill me incessantly.\" Then\nSybil begged to know how they had tried to kill him, and he told her one\nor two of those experiences, such as most soldiers have had, when he had\nbeen fired upon and the balls had torn his clothes or drawn blood. Poor\nSybil was quite overcome, and found a deadly fascination in the horror.\nAs they sat together on the steps with the glorious view spread before\nthem, her attention was so closely fixed on his story that she saw\nneither the view nor even the carriages of tourists who drove up, looked\nabout, and departed, envying Carrington his occupation with the lovely\ngirl.\n\nShe was in imagination rushing with him down the valley of Virginia on\nthe heels of our flying army, or gloomily toiling back to the Potomac\nafter the bloody days at Gettysburg, or watching the last grand deb\u00c3\u00a2cle\non the road from Richmond to Appomattox. They would have sat there till\nsunset if Carrington had not at length insisted that they must go, and\nthen she rose slowly with a deep sigh and undisguised regret.\n\nAs they rode away, Carrington, whose thoughts were not devoted to his\ncompanion so entirely as they should have been, ventured to say that he\nwished her sister had come with them, but he found that his hint was not\nwell received.\n\nSybil emphatically rejected the idea: \"I'm very glad she didn't come. If\nshe had, you would have talked with her all the time, and I should have\nbeen left to amuse myself. You would have been discussing things, and I\nhate discussions. She would have been hunting for first principles,\nand you would have been running about, trying to catch some for her.\nBesides, she is coming herself some Sunday with that tiresome Mr.\nRatcliffe. I don't see what she finds in that man to amuse her. Her\ntaste is getting to be demoralised in Washington. Do you know, Mr.\nCarrington, I'm not clever or serious, like Madeleine, and I can't read\nlaws, and hate politics, but I've more common sense than she has, and\nshe makes me cross with her. I understand now why young widows are\ndangerous, and why they're bumed at their husband's funerals in India.\nNot that I want to have Madeleine burned, for she's a dear, good\ncreature, and I love her better than anything in the world; but she will\ncertainly do herself some dreadful mischief one of these days; she\nhas the most extravagant notions about self-sacrifice and duty; if she\nhadn't luckily thought of taking charge of me, she would have done some\nawful thing long ago, and if I could only be a little wicked, she would\nbe quite happy all the rest of her life in reforming me; but now she has\ngot hold of that Mr. Ratcliffe, and he is trying to make her think she\ncan reform him, and if he does, it's all up with us. Madeleine will just\ngo and break her heart over that odious, great, coarse brute, who only\nwants her money.\"\n\nSybil delivered this little oration with a degree of energy that went to\nCarrington's heart. She did not often make such sustained efforts, and\nit was clear that on this subject she had exhausted her whole mind.\nCarrington was delighted, and urged her on. \"I dislike Mr. Ratcliffe as\nmuch as you do;--more perhaps. So does every one who knows much about\nhim. But we shall only make the matter worse if we interfere. What can\nwe do?\"\n\n\"That is just what I tell everybody,\" resumed Sybil. \"There is Victoria\nDare always telling me I ought to do something; and Mr. Schneidekoupon\ntoo; just as though I could do anything. Madeleine has done nothing but\nget into mischief here. Half the people think her worldly and ambitious.\nOnly last night that spiteful old woman, Mrs. Clinton, said to me: 'Your\nsister is quite spoiled by Washington. She is more wild for power than\nany human being I ever saw.' I was dreadfully angry and told her she was\nquite mistaken--Madeleine was not the least spoiled. But I couldn't\nsay that she was not fond of power, for she is; but not in the way Mrs.\nClinton meant. You should have seen her the other evening when Mr.\nRatcliffe said about some matter of public business that he would do\nwhatever she thought right; she spoke up quite sharply for her, with a\nscornful little laugh, and said that he had better do what he thought\nright. He looked for a moment almost angry, and muttered something about\nwomen's being incomprehensible. He is always trying to tempt her with\npower. She might have had long ago all the power he could give her, but\nI can see, and he sees too, that she always keeps him at arm's length.\nHe doesn't like it, but he expects one of these days to find a bribe\nthat will answer. I wish we had never come to Washington. New York is so\nmuch nicer and the people there are much more amusing; they dance ever\nso much better and send one flowers all the time, and then they never\ntalk about first principles. Maude had her hospitals and paupers and\ntraining school, and got along very well. It was so safe. But when I say\nso to her, she only smiles in a patronising kind of way, and tells me\nthat I shall have as much of Newport as I want; just as though I were a\nchild, and not a woman of twenty-five. Poor Maude! I can't stay with her\nif she marries Mr. Ratcliffe, and it would break my heart to leave her\nwith that man. Do you think he would beat her? Does he drink? I would\nalmost rather be beaten a little, if I cared for a man, than be taken\nout to Peonia. Oh, Mr. Carrington! you are our only hope. She will\nlisten to you. Don't let her marry that dreadful politician.\"\n\nTo all this pathetic appeal, some parts of which were as little\ncalculated to please Carrington as Ratcliffe himself, Carrington\nanswered that he was ready to do all in his power but that Sybil must\ntell him when and how to act.\n\n\"Then, it's a bargain,\" said she; \"whenever I want you, I shall call on\nyou for help, and you shall prevent the marriage.\"\n\n\"Alliance offensive and defensive,\" said he, laughing; \"war to the knife\non Ratcliffe. We will have his scalp if necessary, but I rather think he\nwill soon commit hari-kari himself if we leave him alone.\"\n\n\"Madeleine will like him all the better if he does anything Japanese,\"\nreplied Sybil, with great seriousness; \"I wish there was more Japanese\nbric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac here, or any kind of old pots and pans to talk about. A\nlittle art would be good for her. What a strange place this is, and how\npeople do stand on their heads in it! Nobody thinks like anyone else.\nVictoria Dare says she is trying on principle not to be good, because\nshe wants to keep some new excitements for the next world. I'm sure she\npractices as she preaches. Did you see her at Mrs. Clinton's last night.\nShe behaved more outrageously than ever. She sat on the stairs all\nthrough supper, looking like a demure yellow cat with two bouquets in\nher paws--and I know Lord Dunbeg sent one of them;--and she actually\nlet Mr. French feed her with ice-cream from a spoon. She says she was\nshowing Lord Dunbeg a phase, and that he is going to put it into his\narticle on American Manners and Customs in the Quarterly, but I don't\nthink it's nice, do you, Mr. Carrington? I wish Madeleine had her to\ntake care of. She would have enough to do then, I can tell her.\"\n\nAnd so, gently prattling, Miss Sybil returned to the city, her alliance\nwith Carrington completed; and it was a singular fact that she never\nagain called him dull. There was henceforward a look of more positive\npleasure and cordiality on her face when he made his appearance wherever\nshe might be; and the next time he suggested a horseback excursion she\ninstantly agreed to go, although aware that she had promised a younger\ngentleman of the diplomatic body to be at home that same afternoon, and\nthe good fellow swore polyglot oaths on being turned away from her door.\n\nMr. Ratcliffe knew nothing of this conspiracy against his peace and\nprospects. Even if he had known it, he might only have laughed, and\npursued his own path without a second thought. Yet it was certain that\nhe did not think Carrington's enmity a thing to be overlooked, and from\nthe moment of his obtaining a clue to its cause, he had begun to take\nprecautions against it. Even in the middle of the contest for the\nTreasury, he had found time to listen to Mr. Wilson Keens report on the\naffairs of the late Samuel Baker.\n\nMr. Keen came to him with a copy of Baker's will and with memoranda of\nremarks made by the unsuspecting Mrs. Baker; \"from which it appears,\"\nsaid he, \"that Baker, having no time to put his affairs in order, left\nspecial directions that his executors should carefully destroy all\npapers that might be likely to compromise individuals.\"\n\n\"What is the executor's name?\" interrupted Ratcliffe.\n\n\"The executor's name is--John Carrington,\" said Keen, methodically\nreferring to his copy of the will.\n\nRatcliffe's face was impassive, but the inevitable, \"I knew it,\" almost\nsprang to his lips. He was rather pleased at the instinct which had led\nhim so directly to the right trail.\n\nKeen went on to say that from Mrs. Baker's conversation it was certain\nthat the testator's directions had been carried out, and that the great\nbulk of these papers had been burned.\n\n\"Then it will be useless to press the inquiry further,\" said Ratcliffe;\n\"I am much obliged to you for your assistance,\" and he turned the\nconversation to the condition of Mr. Keen's bureau in the Treasury\ndepartment.\n\nThe next time Ratcliffe saw Mrs. Lee, after his appointment to\nthe Treasury was confirmed, he asked her whether she did not think\nCarrington very well suited for public service, and when she warmly\nassented, he said it had occurred to him to offer the place of Solicitor\nof the Treasury to Mr.\n\nCarrington, for although the actual salary might not be very much more\nthan he earned by his private practice, the incidental advantages to\na Washington lawyer were considerable; and to the Secretary it was\nespecially necessary to have a solicitor in whom he could place entire\nconfidence. Mrs. Lee was pleased by this motion of Ratcliffe's, the more\nbecause she had supposed that Ratcliffe had no liking for Carrington.\nShe doubted whether Carrington would accept the place, but she hoped\nthat it might modify his dislike for Ratcliffe, and she agreed to sound\nhim on the subject. There was something a little compromising in\nthus allowing herself to appear as the dispenser of Mr. Ratcliffe's\npatronage, but she dismissed this objection on the ground that\nCarrington's interests were involved, and that it was for him to judge\nwhether he should take the place or not. Perhaps the world would not be\nso charitable if the appointment were made. What then? Mrs. Lee asked\nherself the question and did not feel quite at ease.\n\nSo far as Carrington was concerned, she might have dismissed her doubts.\n\nThere was not a chance of his taking the place, as very soon appeared.\nWhen she spoke to him on the subject, and repeated what Ratcliffe had\nsaid, his face flushed, and he sat for some moments in silence. He never\nthought very rapidly, but now the ideas seemed to come so fast as to\nbewilder his mind.\n\nThe situation flashed before his eyes like electric sparks. His first\nimpression was that Ratcliffe wanted to buy him; to tie his tongue; to\nmake him run, like a fastened dog, under the waggon of the Secretary of\nthe Treasury. His second notion was that Ratcliffe wanted to put Mrs.\nLee under obligations, in order to win her regard; and, again, that he\nwanted to raise himself in her esteem by posing as a friend of honest\nadministration and unassisted virtue. Then suddenly it occurred to him\nthat the scheme was to make him appear jealous and vindictive; to put\nhim in an attitude where any reason he might give for declining would\nbear a look of meanness, and tend to separate him from Mrs. Lee.\nCarrington was so absorbed by these thoughts, and his mind worked so\nslowly, that he failed to hear one or two remarks addressed to him by\nMrs. Lee, who became a little alarmed, under the impression that he was\nunexpectedly paralyzed.\n\nWhen at length he heard her and attempted to frame an answer, his\nembarrassment increased. He could only stammer that he was sorry to be\nobliged to decline, but this office was one he could not undertake.\n\nIf Madeleine felt a little relieved by this decision, she did not show\nit.\n\nFrom her manner one might have supposed it to be her fondest wish that\nCarrington should be Solicitor of the Treasury. She cross-questioned\nhim with obstinacy. Was not the offer a good one?--and he was obliged to\nconfess that it was. Were the duties such as he could not perform? Not\nat all! there was nothing in the duties which alarmed him. Did he object\nto it because of his southern prejudices against the administration? Oh,\nno! he had no political feeling to stand in his way. What, then, could\nbe his reason for refusing?\n\nCarrington resorted again to silence, until Mrs. Lee, a little\nimpatiently, asked whether it was possible that his personal dislike\nto Racliffe could blind him so far as to make him reject so fair a\nproposal. Carrington, finding himself more and more uncomfortable, rose\nrestlessly from his chair and paced the room. He felt that Ratclife had\nfairly out-generaled him, and he was at his wits' end to know what card\nhe could play that would not lead directly into Ratcliffe's trump suit.\nTo refuse such an offer was hard enough at best, for a man who wanted\nmoney and professional advancement as he did, but to injure himself and\nhelp Ratcliffe by this refusal, was abominably hard. Nevertheless,\nhe was obliged to admit that he would rather not take a position so\ndirectly under Ratcliffe's control. Madeleine said no more, but he\nthought she looked annoyed, and he felt himself in an intolerably\npainful situation. He was not certain that she herself might not have\nhad some share in proposing the plan, and that his refusal might not\nhave some mortifying consequences for her. What must she think of him,\nthen?\n\nAt this very moment he would have given his right arm for a word of real\naffection from Mrs. Lee. He adored her. He would willingly enough have\ndamned himself for her. There was no sacrifice he would not have made to\nbring her nearer to him. In his upright, quiet, simple kind of way, he\nimmolated himself before her. For months his heart had ached with this\nhopeless passion. He recognized that it was hopeless. He knew that she\nwould never love him, and, to do her justice, she never had given him\nreason to suppose that it was in her power to love him, r any man. And\nhere he stood, obliged to appear ungrateful and prejudiced, mean and\nvindictive, in her eyes. He took his seat again, looking so unutterably\ndejected, his patient face so tragically mournful, that Madeleine, after\na while, began to see the absurd side of the matter, and presently burst\ninto a laugh \"Please do not look so frightfully miserable!\" said she;\n\"I did not mean to make you unhappy. After all, what does it matter? You\nhave a perfect right to refuse, and, for my part, I have not the least\nwish to see you accept.\"\n\nOn this, Carrington brightened, and declared that if she thought him\nright in declining, he cared for nothing else. It was only the idea of\nhurting her feelings that weighed on his mind. But in saying this, he\nspoke in a tone that implied a deeper feeling, and made Mrs. Lee again\nlook grave and sigh.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Carrington,\" she said, \"this world will not run as we want.\nDo you suppose the time will ever come when every one will be good and\nhappy and do just what they ought? I thought this offer might possibly\ntake one anxiety off your shoulders. I am sorry now that I let myself be\nled into making it.\"\n\nCarrington could not answer her. He dared not trust his voice. He rose\nto go, and as she held out her hand, he suddenly raised it to his lips,\nand so left her. She sat for a moment with tears in her eyes after he\nwas gone. She thought she knew all that was in his mind, and with\na woman's readiness to explain every act of men by their consuming\npassions for her own sex, she took it as a matter of course that\njealousy was the whole cause of Carrington's hostility to Ratcliffe,\nand she pardoned it with charming alacrity. \"Ten years ago, I could have\nloved him,\" she thought to herself, and then, while she was half smiling\nat the idea, suddenly another thought flashed upon her, and she threw\nher hand up before her face as though some one had struck her a blow.\nCarrington had reopened the old wound.\n\nWhen Ratcliffe came to see her again, which he did very shortly\nafterwards, glad of so good an excuse, she told him of Carrington's\nrefusal, adding only that he seemed unwilling to accept any position\nthat had a political character. Ratcliffe showed no sign of displeasure;\nhe only said, in a benignant tone, that he was sorry to be unable to\ndo something for so good a friend of hers; thus establishing, at all\nevents, his claim on her gratitude. As for Carrington, the offer which\nRatcliffe had made was not intended to be accepted, and Carrington\ncould not have more embarrassed the secretary than by closing with\nit. Ratcliffe's object had been to settle for his own satisfaction the\nquestion of Carrington's hostility, for he knew the man well enough to\nfeel sure that in any event he would act a perfectly straightforward\npart. If he accepted, he would at least be true to his chief. If he\nrefused, as Ratcliffe expected, it would be a proof that some means must\nbe found of getting him out of the way. In any case the offer was a new\nthread in the net that Mr. Ratcliffe flattered himself he was rapidly\nwinding about the affections and ambitions of Mrs. Lee. Yet he had\nreasons of his own for thinking that Carrington, more easily than any\nother man, could cut the meshes of this net if he chose to do so, and\ntherefore that it would be wiser to postpone action until Carrington\nwere disposed of.\n\nWithout a moment's delay he made inquiries as to all the vacant\nor eligible offices in the gift of the government outside his own\ndepartment. Very few of these would answer his purpose. He wanted some\ntemporary law business that would for a time take its holder away to a\ndistance, say to Australia or Central Asia, the further the better; it\nmust be highly paid, and it must be given in such a way as not to excite\nsuspicion that Ratcliffe was concerned in the matter. Such an office was\nnot easily found. There is little law business in Central Asia, and\nat this moment there was not enough to require a special agent in\nAustralia. Carrington could hardly be induced to lead an expedition\nto the sources of the Nile in search of business merely to please Mr.\nRatcliffe, nor could the State Department offer encouragement to a hope\nthat government would pay the expenses of such an expedition. The\nbest that Ratcliffe could do was to select the place of counsel to the\nMexican claims-commission which was soon to meet in the city of\nMexico, and which would require about six months' absence. By a little\nmanagement he could contrive to get the counsel sent away in advance\nof the commission, in order to work up a part of the case on the spot.\nRatcliffe acknowledged that Mexico was too near, but he drily remarked\nto himself that if Carrington could get back in time to dislodge him\nafter he had once got a firm hold on Mrs. Lee, he would never try to run\nanother caucus.\n\nThe point once settled in his own mind, Ratcliffe, with his usual\nrapidity of action, carried his scheme into effect. In this there was\nlittle difficulty. He dropped in at the office of the Secretary of State\nwithin eight-and-forty hours after his last conversation with Mrs.\nLee. During these early days of every new administration, the absorbing\nbusiness of government relates principally to appointments. The\nSecretary of the Treasury was always ready to oblige his colleagues in\nthe Cabinet by taking care of their friends to any reasonable extent.\nThe Secretary of State was not less courteous. The moment he understood\nthat Mr. Ratcliffe had a strong wish to secure the appointment of\na certain person as counsel to the Mexican claims-commission, the\nSecretary of State professed readiness to gratify him, and when he heard\nwho the proposed person was, the suggestion was hailed with pleasure,\nfor Carrington was well known and much liked at the Department, and\nwas indeed an excellent man for the place. Ratcliffe hardly needed to\npromise an equivalent. The business was arranged in ten minutes.\n\n\"I only need say,\" added Ratcliffe, \"that if my agency in the affair is\nknown, Mr. Carrington will certainly refuse the place, for he is one of\nyour old-fashioned Virginia planters, proud as Lucifer, and willing\nto accept nothing by way of favour. I will speak to your Assistant\nSecretary about it, and the recommendation shall appear to come from\nhim.\"\n\nThe very next day Carrington received a private note from his old\nfriend, the Assistant Secretary of State, who was overjoyed to do him a\nkindness.\n\nThe note asked him to call at the Department at his earliest\nconvenience. He went, and the Assistant Secretary announced that he\nhad recommended Carrington's appointment as counsel to the\nMexican claims-commission, and that the Secretary had approved the\nrecommendation. \"We want a Southern man, a lawyer with a little\nknowledge of international law, one who can go at once, and, above all,\nan honest man. You fit the description to a hair; so pack your trunk as\nsoon as you like.\"\n\nCarrington was startled. Coming as it did, this offer was not only\nunobjectionable, but tempting. It was hard for him even to imagine a\nreason for hesitation. From the first he felt that he must go, and yet\nto go was the very last thing he wanted to do. That he should suspect\nRatcliffe to be at the bottom of this scheme of banishment was a matter\nof course, and he instantly asked whether any influence had been used\nin his favour; but the Assistant Secretary so stoutly averred that\nthe appointment was made on his recommendation alone, as to block all\nfurther inquiry. Technically this assertion was exact, and it made\nCarrington feel that it would be base ingratitude on his part not to\naccept a favour so handsomely offered.\n\nYet he could not make up his mind to acceptance. He begged four and\ntwenty hours' delay, in order, as he said, to see whether he could\narrange his affairs for a six months' absence, although he knew there\nwould be no difficulty in his doing so. He went away and sat in his\noffice alone, gloomily wondering what he could do, although from the\nfirst he saw that the situation was only too clear, and there could not\nbe the least dark corner of a doubt to crawl into. Six months ago he\nwould have jumped at this offer.\n\nWhat had happened within six months to make it seem a disaster?\n\nMrs. Lee! There was the whole story. To go away now was to give up Mrs.\nLee, and probably to give her up to Ratcliffe. Carrington gnashed his\nteeth when he thought how skilfully Ratcliffe was playing his cards. The\nlonger he reflected, the more certain he felt that Ratcliffe was at\nthe bottom of this scheme to get rid of him; and yet, as he studied\nthe situation, it occurred to him that after all it was possible for\nRatcliffe to make a blunder. This Illinois politician was clever, and\nunderstood men; but a knowledge of men is a very different thing from\na knowledge of women. Carrington himself had no great experience in the\narticle of women, but he thought he knew more than Ratcliffe, who was\nevidently relying most on his usual theory of political corruption as\napplied to feminine weaknesses, and who was only puzzled at finding how\nhigh a price Mrs. Lee set on herself. If Ratcliffe were really at the\nbottom of the scheme for separating Carrington from her, it could only\nbe because he thought that six months, or even six weeks, would\nbe enough to answer his purpose. And on reaching this point in his\nreflections, Carrington suddenly rose, lit a cigar, and walked up and\ndown his room steadily for the next hour, with the air of a general\narranging a plan of campaign, or a lawyer anticipating his opponent's\nline of argument.\n\nOn one point his mind was made up. He would accept. If Ratcliffe really\nhad a hand in this move, he should be gratified. If he had laid a trap,\nhe should be caught in it. And when the evening came, Carrington took\nhis hat and walked off to call upon Mrs. Lee.\n\nHe found the sisters alone and quietly engaged in their occupations.\n\nMadeleine was dramatically mending an open-work silk stocking, a\ndelicate and difficult task which required her whole mind. Sybil was at\nthe piano as usual, and for the first time since he had known her, she\nrose when he came in, and, taking her work-basket, sat down to share in\nthe conversation. She meant to take her place as a woman, henceforward.\nShe was tired of playing girl. Mr. Carrington should see that she was\nnot a fool.\n\nCarrington plunged at once into his subject, and announced the offer\nmade to him, at which Madeleine expressed delight, and asked many\nquestions. What was the pay? How soon must he go? How long should he be\naway? Was there danger from the climate? and finally she added, with a\nsmile, \"What am I to say to Mr. Ratcliffe if you accept this offer after\nrefusing his?\" As for Sybil, she made one reproachful exclamation: \"Oh,\nMr. Carrington!\" and sank back into silence and consternation. Her\nfirst experiment at taking a stand of her own in the world was not\nencouraging. She felt betrayed.\n\nNor was Carrington gay. However modest a man may be, only an idiot\ncan forget himself entirely in pursuing the moon and the stars. In the\nbottom of his soul, he had a lingering hope that when he told his\nstory, Madeleine might look up with a change of expression, a glance\nof unpremeditated regard, a little suffusion of the eyes, a little\ntrembling of the voice. To see himself relegated to Mexico with such\ncheerful alacrity by the woman he loved was not the experience he would\nhave chosen. He could not help feeling that his hopes were disposed of,\nand he watched her with a painful sinking of the heart, which did not\nlead to lightness of conversation. Madeleine herself felt that her\nexpressions needed to be qualified, and she tried to correct her\nmistake. What should she do without a tutor? she said. He must let her\nhave a list of books to read while he was away: they were themselves\ngoing north in the middle of May, and Carrington would be back by the\ntime they returned in December. After all, they should see as little of\nhim during the summer if he were in Virginia as if he were in Mexico.\n\nCarrington gloomily confessed that he was very unwilling to go; that he\nwished the idea had never been suggested; that he should be perfectly\nhappy if for any reason the scheme broke down; but he gave no\nexplanation of his feeling, and Madeleine had too much tact to press\nfor one. She contented herself by arguing against it, and talking as\nvivaciously as she could. Her heart really bled for him as she saw\nhis face grow more and more pathetic in its quiet expression of\ndisappointment. But what could she say or do? He sat till after ten\no'clock; he could not tear himself away. He felt that this was the end\nof his pleasure in life; he dreaded the solitude of his thoughts.\nMrs. Lee's resources began to show signs of exhaustion. Long pauses\nintervened between her remarks; and at length Carrington, with a\nsuperhuman effort, apologized for inflicting himself upon her so\nunmercifully. If she knew, he said, how he dreaded being alone, she\nwould forgive him. Then he rose to go, and, in taking leave, asked Sybil\nif she was inclined to ride the next day; if so, he was at her service.\nSybil's face brightened as she accepted the invitation.\n\nMrs. Lee, a day or two afterwards, did mention Carrington's appointment\nto Mr. Ratcliffe, and she told Carrington that the Secretary certainly\nlooked hurt and mortified, but showed it only by almost instantly\nchanging the subject.\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nTHE next morning Carrington called at the Department and announced his\nacceptance of the post. He was told that his instructions would be ready\nin about a fortnight, and that he would be expected to start as soon as\nhe received them; in the meanwhile, he must devote himself to the study\nof a mass of papers in the Department. There was no trifling allowable\nhere.\n\nCarrington had to set himself vigorously to work. This did not, however,\nprevent him from keeping his appointment with Sybil, and at four o'clock\nthey started together, passing out into the quiet shadows of Rock Creek,\nand seeking still lanes through the woods where their horses walked side\nby side, and they themselves could talk without the risk of criticism\nfrom curious eyes. It was the afternoon of one of those sultry and\nlowering spring days when life germinates rapidly, but as yet gives no\nsign, except perhaps some new leaf or flower pushing its soft head\nup against the dead leaves that have sheltered it. The two riders had\nsomething of the same sensation, as though the leafless woods and\nthe laurel thickets, the warm, moist air and the low clouds, were a\nprotection and a soft shelter. Somewhat to Carrington's surprise, he\nfound that it was pleasant to have Sybil's company. He felt towards her\nas to a sister--a favourite sister.\n\nShe at once attacked him for abandoning her and breaking his treaty so\nlately made, and he tried to gain her sympathy by saying that if she\nknew how much he was troubled, she would forgive him. Then when Sybil\nasked whether he really must go and leave her without any friend whom\nshe could speak to, his feelings got the better of him: he could not\nresist the temptation to confide all his troubles in her, since there\nwas no one else in whom he could confide. He told her plainly that he\nwas in love with her sister.\n\n\"You say that love is nonsense, Miss Ross. I tell you it is no such\nthing. For weeks and months it is a steady physical pain, an ache about\nthe heart, never leaving one, by night or by day; a long strain on one's\nnerves like toothache or rheumatism, not intolerable at any one instant,\nbut exhausting by its steady drain on the strength. It is a disease to\nbe borne with patience, like any other nervous complaint, and to be\ntreated with counter-irritants. My trip to Mexico will be good for it,\nbut that is not the reason why I must go.\"\n\nThen he told her all his private circumstances; the ruin which the war\nhad brought on him and his family; how, of his two brothers, one\nhad survived the war only to die at home, a mere wreck of disease,\nprivation, and wounds; the other had been shot by his side, and bled\nslowly to death in his arms during the awful carnage in the Wilderness;\nhow his mother and two sisters were struggling for a bare subsistence\non a wretched Virginian farm, and how all his exertions barely kept them\nfrom beggary.\n\n\"You have no conception of the poverty to which our southern women\nare reduced since the war,\" said he; \"they are many of them literally\nwithout clothes or bread.\" The fee he should earn by going to Mexico\nwould double his income this year. Could he refuse? Had he a right to\nrefuse? And poor Carrington added, with a groan, that if he alone were\nin question, he would sooner be shot than go.\n\nSybil listened with tears in her eyes. She never before had seen a man\nshow suffering. The misery she had known in life had been more or less\nveiled to her and softened by falling on older and friendly shoulders.\nShe now got for the first time a clear view of Carrington, apart from\nthe quiet exterior in which the man was hidden. She felt quite sure, by\na sudden flash of feminine inspiration, that the curious look of patient\nendurance on his face was the work of a single night when he had held\nhis brother in his arms, and knew that the blood was draining drop by\ndrop from his side, in the dense, tangled woods, beyond the reach of\nhelp, hour after hour, till the voice failed and the limbs grew stiff\nand cold. When he had finished his story, she was afraid to speak. She\ndid not know how to show her sympathy, and she could not bear to seem\nunsympathetic. In her embarrassment she fairly broke down and could only\ndry her eyes in silence.\n\nHaving once got this weight of confidence off his mind, Carrington felt\ncomparatively gay and was ready to make the best of things. He laughed\nat himself to drive away the tears of his pretty companion, and obliged\nher to take a solemn pledge never to betray him. \"Of course your sister\nknows it all,\" he said; \"but she must never know that I told you, and I\nnever would tell any one but you.\"\n\nSybil promised faithfully to keep his confidence to herself, and she\nwent on to defend her sister.\n\n\"You must not blame Madeleine,\" said she; \"if you knew as well as I do\nwhat she has been through, you would not think her cold. You do know how\nsuddenly her husband died, after only one day's illness, and what a nice\nfellow he was. She was very fond of him, and his death seemed to stun\nher. We hardly knew what to make of it, she was so quiet and natural.\nThen just a week later her little child died of diphtheria, suffering\nhorribly, and she wild with despair because she could not relieve it.\nAfter that, she was almost insane; indeed, I have always thought she was\nquite insane for a time. I know she was excessively violent and wanted\nto kill herself, and I never heard any one rave as she did about\nreligion and resignation and God. After a few weeks she became quiet and\nstupid and went about like a machine; and at last she got over it, but\nhas never been what she was before. You know she was a rather fast\nNew York girl before she married, and cared no more about politics and\nphilanthropy than I do. It was a very late thing, all this stuff.\nBut she is not really hard, though she may seem so. It is all on the\nsurface. I always know when she is thinking about her husband or child,\nbecause her face gets rigid; she looks then as she used to look after\nher child died, as though she didn't care what became of her and she\nwould just as lieve kill herself as not. I don't think she will ever\nlet herself love any one again. She has a horror of it. She is much more\nlikely to go in for ambition, or duty, or self-sacrifice.\"\n\nThey rode on for a while in silence, Carrington perplexed by the problem\nhow two harmless people such as Madeleine and he could have been made\nby a beneficent Providence the sport of such cruel tortures; and Sybil\nequally interested in thinking what sort of a brother-in-law Carrington\nwould make; on the whole, she thought she liked him better as he was.\nThe silence was only broken by Carrington's bringing the conversation\nback to its starting-point: \"Something must be done to keep your sister\nout of Ratcliffe's power. I have thought about it till I am tired. Can\nyou make no suggestion?\"\n\nNo! Sybil was helpless and dreadfully alarmed. Mr. Ratcliffe came to the\nhouse as often as he could, and seemed to tell Madeleine everything\nthat was going on in politics, and ask her advice, and Madeleine did not\ndiscourage him. \"I do believe she likes it, and thinks she can do some\ngood by it. I don't dare speak to her about it. She thinks me a child\nstill, and treats me as though I were fifteen. What can I do?\"\n\nCarrington said he had thought of speaking to Mrs. Lee himself, but he\ndid not know what to say, and if he offended her, he might drive her\ndirectly into Ratcliffe's arms. But Sybil thought she would not be\noffended if he went to work in the right way. \"She will stand more from\nyou than from any one else. Tell her openly that you--that you love\nher,\" said Sybil with a burst of desperate courage; \"she can't take\noffence at that; and then you can say almost anything.\"\n\nCarrington looked at Sybil with more admiration than he had ever\nexpected to feel for her, and began to think that he might do worse\nthan to put himself under her orders. After all, she had some practical\nsense, and what was more to the point, she was handsomer than ever, as\nshe sat erect on her horse, the rich colour rushing up under the warm\nskin, at the impropriety of her speech. \"You are certainly right,\" said\nhe; \"after all, I have nothing to lose. Whether she marries Ratcliffe or\nnot, she will never marry me, I suppose.\"\n\nThis speech was a cowardly attempt to beg encouragement from Sybil,\nand met with the fate it deserved, for Sybil, highly flattered at\nCarrington's implied praise, and bold as a lioness now that it was\nCarrington's fingers, and not her own, that were to go into the fire,\ngave him on the spot a feminine view of the situation that did not\nencourage his hopes. She plainly said that men seemed to take leave of\ntheir senses as soon as women were concerned; for her part, she could\nnot understand what there was in any woman to make such a fuss about;\nshe thought most women were horrid; men were ever so much nicer; \"and\nas for Madeleine, whom all of you are ready to cut each other's throats\nabout, she's a dear, good sister, as good as gold, and I love her with\nall my heart, but you wouldn't like her, any of you, if you married her;\nshe has always had her own way, and she could not help taking it; she\nnever could learn to take yours; both of you would be unhappy in a week;\nand as for that old Mr. Ratcliffe, she would make his life a burden--and\nI hope she will,\" concluded Sybil with a spiteful little explosion of\nhatred.\n\nCarrington could not help being amused by Sybil's way of dealing with\naffairs of the heart. Emboldened by encouragement, she went on to attack\nhim pitilessly for going down on his knees before her sister, \"just as\nthough you were not as good as she is,\" and openly avowed that, if she\nwere a man, she would at least have some pride. Men like this kind of\npunishment.\n\nCarrington did not attempt to defend himself; he even courted Sybil's\nattack. They both enjoyed their ride through the bare woods, by the\nrippling spring streams, under the languid breath of the moist south\nwind. It was a small idyll, all the more pleasant because there was\ngloom before and behind it. Sybil's irrepressible gaiety made Carrington\ndoubt whether, after all, life need be so serious a matter. She had\nanimal spirits in plenty, and it needed an effort for her to keep them\ndown, while Carrington's spirits were nearly exhausted after twenty\nyears of strain, and he required a greater effort to hold himself up.\nThere was every reason why he should be grateful to Sybil for lending\nto him from her superfluity. He enjoyed being laughed at by her. Suppose\nMadeleine Lee did refuse to marry him! What of it?\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Sybil; \"you men are all just alike. How can you be so\nsilly? Madeleine and you would be intolerable together. Do find some one\nwho won't be solemn!\"\n\nThey laid out their little plot against Madeleine and elaborated it\ncarefully, both as to what Carrington should say and how he should say\nit, for Sybil asserted that men were too stupid to be trusted even in\nmaking a declaration of love, and must be taught, like little children\nto say their prayers. Carrington enjoyed being taught how to make a\ndeclaration of love.\n\nHe did not ask where Sybil had learned so much about men's stupidity. He\nthought perhaps Schneidekoupon could have thrown light on the subject.\nAt all events, they were so busily occupied with their schemes and\nlessons, that they did not-reach home till Madeleine had become anxious\nlest they had met with some accident. The long dusk had become darkness\nbefore she heard the clatter of hoofs on the asphalt pavement, and she\nwent down to the door to scold them for their delay. Sybil only laughed\nat her, and said it was all Mr. Carrington's fault: he had lost his way,\nand she had been forced to find it for him.\n\nTen days more passed before their plan was carried into effect. April\nhad come. Carrington's work was completed and he was ready to start on\nhis journey. Then at last he appeared one evening at Mrs. Lee's at the\nvery moment when Sybil, as chance would have it, was going out to\npass an hour or two with her friend Victoria Dare a few doors away.\nCarrington felt a little ashamed as she went. This kind of conspiracy\nbehind Mrs. Lee's back was not to his taste.\n\nHe resolutely sat down, and plunged at once into his subject. He was\nalmost ready to go, he said; he had nearly completed his work in the\nDepartment, and he was assured that his instructions and papers would be\nready in two days more; he might not have another chance to see Mrs. Lee\nso quietly again, and he wanted to take his leave now, for this was what\nlay most heavily on his mind; he should have gone willingly and gladly\nif it had not been for uneasiness about her; and yet he had till now\nbeen afraid to speak openly on the subject. Here he paused for a moment\nas though to invite some reply.\n\nMadeleine laid down her work with a look of regret though not of\nannoyance, and said frankly and instantly that he had been too good\na friend to allow of her taking offence at anything he could say; she\nwould not pretend to misunderstand him. \"My affairs,\" she added with a\nshade of bitterness, \"seem to have become public property, and I would\nrather have some voice in discussing them myself than to know they are\ndiscussed behind my back.\"\n\nThis was a sharp thrust at the very outset, but Carrington turned it\naside and went quietly on:\n\n\"You are frank and loyal, as you always are. I will be so too. I can't\nhelp being so. For months I have had no other pleasure than in being\nnear you. For the first time in my life I have known what it is to\nforget my own affairs in loving a woman who seems to me without a fault,\nand for one solitary word from whom I would give all I have in life, and\nperhaps itself.\"\n\nMadeleine flushed and bent towards him with an earnestness of manner\nthat repeated itself in her tone.\n\n\"Mr. Carrington, I am the best friend you have on earth. One of these\ndays you will thank me with your whole soul for refusing to listen to\nyou now. You do not know how much misery I am saving you. I have no\nheart to give. You want a young, fresh life to help yours; a gay, lively\ntemperament to enliven your despondency; some one still young enough to\nabsorb herself in you and make all her existence yours. I could not do\nit. I can give you nothing. I have done my best to persuade myself that\nsome day I might begin life again with the old hopes and feelings, but\nit is no use. The fire is burned out. If you married me, you would\ndestroy yourself You would wake up some day, and find the universe dust\nand ashes.\"\n\nCarrington listened in silence. He made no attempt to interrupt or to\ncontradict her. Only at the end he said with a little bitterness: \"My\nown life is worth so much to the world and to me, that I suppose it\nwould be wrong to risk it on such a venture; but I would risk it,\nnevertheless, if you gave me the chance. Do you think me wicked for\ntempting Providence? I do not mean to annoy you with entreaties. I have\na little pride left, and a great deal of respect for you. Yet I think,\nin spite of all you have said or can say, that one disappointed life may\nbe as able to find happiness and repose in another, as to get them by\nsucking the young life-blood of a fresh soul.\"\n\nTo this speech, which was unusually figurative for Carrington, Mrs. Lee\ncould find no ready answer. She could only reply that Carrington's life\nwas worth quite as much as his neighbour's, and that it was worth so\nmuch to her, if not to himself, that she would not let him wreck it.\n\nCarrington went on: \"Forgive my talking in this way. I do not mean to\ncomplain. I shall always love you just as much, whether you care for\nme or not, because you are the only woman I have ever met, or am ever\nlikely to meet, who seems to me perfect.\"\n\nIf this was Sybil's teaching, she had made the best of her time.\n\nCarrington's tone and words pierced through all Mrs. Lee's armour as\nthough they were pointed with the most ingenious cruelty, and designed\nto torture her. She felt hard and small before him. Life for life,\nhis had been, and was now, far less bright than hers, yet he was her\nsuperior. He sat there, a true man, carrying his burden calmly, quietly,\nwithout complaint, ready to face the next shock of life with the same\nendurance he had shown against the rest. And he thought her perfect!\nShe felt humiliated that any brave man should say to her face that he\nthought her perfect! She! perfect! In her contrition she was half ready\nto go down at his feet and confess her sins; her hysterical dread of\nsorrow and suffering, her narrow sympathies, her feeble faith, her\nmiserable selfishness, her abject cowardice. Every nerve in her body\ntingled with shame when she thought what a miserable fraud she was; what\na mass of pretensions unfounded, of deceit ingrained. She was ready to\nhide her face in her hands. She was disgusted, outraged with her own\nimage as she saw it, contrasted with Carrington's single word: Perfect!\n\nNor was this the worst. Carrington was not the first man who had thought\nher perfect. To hear this word suddenly used again, which had never been\nuttered to her before except by lips now dead and gone, made her brain\nreel. She seemed to hear her husband once more telling her that she was\nperfect. Yet against this torture, she had a better defence. She had\nlong since hardened herself to bear these recollections, and they\nsteadied and strengthened her.\n\nShe had been called perfect before now, and what had come of it? Two\ngraves, and a broken life! She drew herself up with a face now grown\nquite pale and rigid. In reply to Carrington, she said not a word, but\nonly shook her head slightly without looking at him.\n\nHe went on: \"After all, it is not my own happiness I am thinking of but\nyours. I never was vain enough to think that I was worth your love, or\nthat I could ever win it. Your happiness is another thing. I care so\nmuch for that as to make me dread going away, for fear that you may\nyet find yourself entangled in this wretched political life here, when,\nperhaps if I stayed, I might be of some use.\"\n\n\"Do you really think, then, that I am going to fall a victim to Mr.\nRatcliffe?\" asked Madeleine, with a cold smile.\n\n\"Why not?\" replied Carrington, in a similar tone. \"He can put forward\na strong claim to your sympathy and help, if not to your love. He can\noffer you a great field of usefulness which you want. He has been very\nfaithful to you. Are you quite sure that even now you can refuse him\nwithout his complaining that you have trifled with him?\"\n\n\"And are you quite sure,\" added Mrs. Lee, evasively, \"that you have not\nbeen judging him much too harshly? I think I know him better than you.\nHe has many good qualities, and some high ones. What harm can he do me?\nSupposing even that he did succeed in persuading me that my life could\nbe best used in helping his, why should I be afraid of it?\"\n\n\"You and I,\" said Carrington, \"are wide apart in our estimates of Mr.\nRatcliffe. To you, of course, he shows his best side. He is on his good\nbehaviour, and knows that any false step will ruin him. I see in him\nonly a coarse, selfish, unprincipled politician, who would either drag\nyou down to his own level, or, what is more likely, would very soon\ndisgust you and make your life a wretched self-immolation before his\nvulgar ambition, or compel you to leave him. In either case you would\nbe the victim. You cannot afford to make another false start in life.\nReject me! I have not a word to say against it. But be on your guard\nagainst giving your existence up to him.\"\n\n\"Why do you think so ill of Mr. Ratcliffe?\" asked Madeleine; \"he always\nspeaks highly of you. Do you know anything against him that the world\ndoes not?\"\n\n\"His public acts are enough to satisfy me,\" replied Carrington, evading\na part of the question. \"You know that I have never had but one opinion\nabout him.\"\n\nThere was a pause in the conversation. Both parties felt that as yet no\ngood had come of it. At length Madeleine asked, \"What would you have me\ndo? Is it a pledge you want that I will under no circumstances marry Mr.\nRatcliffe?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" was the answer; \"you know me better than to think\nI would ask that. I only want you to take time and keep out of his\ninfluence until your mind is fairly made up. A year hence I feel certain\nthat you will think of him as I do.\"\n\n\"Then you will allow me to marry him if I find that you are mistaken,\"\nsaid Mrs. Lee, with a marked tone of sarcasm.\n\nCarrington looked annoyed, but he answered quietly, \"What I fear is\nhis influence here and now. What I would like to see you do is this: go\nnorth a month earlier than you intended, and without giving him time\nto act. If I were sure you were safely in Newport, I should feel no\nanxiety.\"\n\n\"You seem to have as bad an opinion of Washington as Mr. Gore,\" said\nMadeleine, with a contemptuous smile. \"He gave me the same advice,\nthough he was afraid to tell me why. I am not a child. I am thirty years\nold, and have seen something of the world. I am not afraid, like Mr.\nGore, of Washington malaria, or, like you, of Mr. Ratcliffe's influence.\nIf I fall a victim I shall deserve my fate, and certainly I shall have\nno cause to complain of my friends. They have given me advice enough for\na lifetime.\"\n\nCarrington's face darkened with a deeper shade of regret. The turn which\nthe conversation had taken was precisely what he had expected, and both\nSybil and he had agreed that Madeleine would probably answer just in\nthis way.\n\nNevertheless, he could not but feel acutely the harm he was doing to\nhis own interests, and it was only by a sheer effort of the will that he\nforced himself to a last and more earnest attack.\n\n\"I know it is an impertinence,\" he said; \"I wish it were in my power to\nshow how much it costs me to offend you. This is the first time you\never had occasion to be offended. If I were to yield to the fear of\nyour anger and were to hold my tongue now, and by any chance you were\nto wreck your life on this rock, I should never forgive myself the\ncowardice. I should always think I might have done something to prevent\nit. This is probably the last time I shall have the chance to talk\nopenly with you, and I implore you to listen to me. I want nothing for\nmyself If I knew I should never see you again, I would still say the\nsame thing. Leave Washington! Leave it now!--at once!--without giving\nmore than twenty-four hours' notice! Leave it without letting Mr.\nRatcliffe see you again in private! Come back next winter if you please,\nand then accept him if you think proper. I only pray you to think long\nabout it and decide when you are not here.\"\n\nMadeleine's eyes flashed, and she threw aside her embroidery with an\nimpatient gesture: \"No! Mr. Carrington! I will not be dictated to! I\nwill carry out my own plans! I do not mean to marry Mr. Ratcliffe. If I\nhad meant it, I should have done it before now. But I will not run away\nfrom him or from myself. It would be unladylike, undignified, cowardly.\"\n\nCarrington could say no more. He had come to the end of his lesson. A\nlong silence ensued and then he rose to go. \"Are you angry with me?\"\nsaid she in a softer tone.\n\n\"I ought to ask that question,\" said he. \"Can you forgive me? I am\nafraid not. No man can say to a woman what I have said to you, and be\nquite forgiven. You will never think of me again as you would have done\nif I had not spoken. I knew that before I did it. As for me, I can only\ngo on with my old life. It is not gay, and will not be the gayer for our\ntalk to-night.\"\n\nMadeleine relented a little: \"Friendships like ours are not so easily\nbroken,\" she said. \"Do not do me another injustice. You will see me\nagain before you go?\"\n\nHe assented and bade good-night. Mrs. Lee, weary and disturbed in mind,\nhastened to her room. \"When Miss Sybil comes in, tell her that I am not\nvery well, and have gone to bed,\" were her instructions to her maid, and\nSybil thought she knew the cause of this headache.\n\nBut before Carrington's departure he had one more ride with Sybil,\nand reported to her the result of the interview, at which both of them\nconfessed themselves much depressed. Carrington expressed some hope that\nMadeleine meant, after a sort, to give a kind of pledge by saying that\nshe had no intention of marrying Mr. Ratcliffe, but Sybil shook her head\nemphatically:\n\n\"How can a woman tell whether she is going to accept a man until she is\nasked?\" said she with entire confidence, as though she were stating the\nsimplest fact in the world. Carrington looked puzzled, and ventured to\nask whether women did not generally make up their minds beforehand on\nsuch an interesting point; but Sybil overwhelmed him with contempt:\n\"What good will they do by making up their minds, I should like to\nknow? of course they would go and do the opposite. Sensible women don't\npretend to make up their minds, Mr. Carrington. But you men are so\nstupid, and you can't understand in the least.\"\n\nCarrington gave it up, and went back to his stale question: Could Sybil\nsuggest any other resource? and Sybil sadly confessed that she could\nnot. So far as she could see, they must trust to luck, and she thought\nit was cruel tor Mr. Carrington to go away and leave her alone without\nhelp. He had promised to prevent the marriage.\n\n\"One thing more I mean to do,\" said Carrington: \"and here everything\nwill depend on your courage and nerve. You may depend upon it that Mr.\nRatcliffe will offer himself before you go north. He does not suspect\nyou of making trouble, and he will not think about you in any way if you\nlet him alone and keep quiet. When he does offer himself you will know\nit; at least your sister will tell you if she has accepted him. If she\nrefuses him point blank, you will have nothing to do but to keep her\nsteady. If you see her hesitating, you must break in at any cost, and\nuse all your influence to stop her. Be bold, then, and do your best. If\neverything fails and she still clings to him, I must play my last card,\nor rather you must play it for me. I shall leave with you a sealed\nletter which you are to give her if everything else fails. Do it before\nshe sees Ratcliffe a second time. See that she reads it and, if\nnecessary, make her read it, no matter when or where. No one else must\nknow that it exists, and you must take as much care of it as though it\nwere a diamond. You are not to know what is in it; it must be a complete\nsecret. Do you understand?\"\n\nSybil thought she did, but her heart sank. \"When shall you give me this\nletter?\" she asked.\n\n\"The evening before I start, when I come to bid good-bye; probably next\nSunday. This letter is our last hope. If, after reading that, she does\nnot give him up, you will have to pack your trunk, my dear Sybil, and\nfind a new home, for you can never live with them.\"\n\nHe had never before called her by her first name, and it pleased her\nto hear it now, though she generally had a strong objection to such\nfamiliarities.\n\n\"Oh, I wish you were not going!\" she exclaimed tearfully. \"What shall I\ndo when you are gone?\"\n\nAt this pitiful appeal, Carrington felt a sudden pang. He found that\nhe was not so old as he had thought. Certainly he had grown to like her\nfrank honesty and sound common sense, and he had at length discovered\nthat she was handsome, with a very pretty figure. Was it not something\nlike a flirtation he had been carrying on with this young person for the\nlast month? A glimmering of suspicion crossed his mind, though he got\nrid of it as quickly as possible. For a man of his age and sobriety\nto be in love with two sisters at once was impossible; still more\nimpossible that Sybil should care for him.\n\nAs for her, however, there was no doubt about the matter. She had grown\nto depend upon him, and she did it with all the blind confidence of\nyouth. To lose him was a serious disaster. She had never before felt\nthe sensation, and she thought it most disagreeable. Her youthful\ndiplomatists and admirers could not at all fill Carrington's place. They\ndanced and chirruped cheerfully on the hollow crust of society, but they\nwere wholly useless when one suddenly fell through and found oneself\nstruggling in the darkness and dangers beneath. Young women, too, are\napt to be flattered by the confidences of older men; they have a keen\npalate for whatever savours of experience and adventure. For the first\ntime in her life, Sybil had found a man who gave some play to her\nimagination; one who had been a rebel, and had grown used to the shocks\nof fate, so as to walk with calmness into the face of death, and to\ncommand or obey with equal indifference. She felt that he would tell her\nwhat to do when the earthquake came, and would be at hand to consult,\nwhich is in a woman's eyes the great object of men's existence,\nwhen trouble comes. She suddenly conceived that Washington would be\nintolerable without him, and that she should never get the courage to\nfight Mr. Ratcliffe alone, or, if she did, she should make some fatal\nmistake.\n\nThey finished their ride very soberly. She began to show a new interest\nin all that concerned him, and asked many questions about his sisters\nand their plantation. She wanted to ask him whether she could not do\nsomething to help them, but this seemed too awkward. On his part he\nmade her promise to write him faithfully all that took place, and\nthis request pleased her, though she knew his interest was all on her\nsister's account.\n\nThe following Sunday evening when he came to bid good-bye, it was still\nworse. There was no chance for private talk. Ratcliffe was there, and\nseveral diplomatists, including old Jacobi, who had eyes like a cat\nand saw every motion of one's face. Victoria Dare was on the sofa,\nchattering with Lord Dunbeg; Sybil would rather have had any ordinary\nillness, even to the extent of a light case of scarlet fever or\nsmall-pox than let her know what was the matter. Carrington found means\nto get Sybil into another room for a moment and to give her the letter\nhe had promised. Then he bade her good-bye, and in doing so he reminded\nher of her promise to write, pressing her hand and looking into her eyes\nwith an earnestness that made her heart beat faster, although she\nsaid to herself that his interest was all about her sister; as it\nwas--mostly. The thought did not raise her spirits, but she went through\nwith her performance like a heroine. Perhaps she was a little pleased to\nsee that he parted from Madeleine with much less apparent feeling. One\nwould have said that they were two good friends who had no troublesome\nsentiment to worry them. But then every eye in the room was watching\nthis farewell, and speculating about it. Ratcliffe looked on with\nparticular interest and was a little perplexed to account for this too\nfraternal cordiality. Could he have made a miscalculation? or was there\nsomething behind? He himself insisted upon shaking hands genially with\nCarrington and wished him a pleasant journey and a successful one.\n\nThat night, for the first time since she was a child, Sybil actually\ncried a little after she went to bed, although it is true that her\nsentiment did not keep her awake. She felt lonely and weighed down by a\ngreat responsibility.\n\nFor a day or two afterwards she was nervous and restless. She would\nnot ride, or make calls, or see guests. She tried to sing a little, and\nfound it tiresome. She went out and sat for hours in the Square, where\nthe spring sun was shining warm and bright on the prancing horse of the\ngreat Andrew Jackson. She was a little cross, too, and absent, and spoke\nso often about Carrington that at last Madeleine was struck by sudden\nsuspicion, and began to watch her with anxious care.\n\nTuesday night, after this had gone on for two days, Sybil was in\nMadeleine's room, where she often stayed to talk while her sister was at\nher toilet.\n\nThis evening she threw herself listlessly on the couch, and within five\nminutes again quoted Carrington. Madeleine turned from the glass before\nwhich she was sitting, and looked her steadily in the face.\n\n\"Sybil,\" said she, \"this is the twenty-fourth time you have mentioned\nMr. Carrington since we sat down to dinner. I have waited for the round\nnumber to decide whether I should take any notice of it or not? what\ndoes it mean, my child? Do you care for Mr. Carrington?\"\n\n\"Oh, Maude!\" exclaimed Sybil reproachfully, flushing so violently that,\neven by that dim light, her sister could not but see it.\n\nMrs. Lee rose and, crossing the room, sat down by Sybil who was lying\non the couch and turned her face away. Madeleine put her arms round her\nneck and kissed her.\n\n\"My poor--poor child!\" said she pityingly. \"I never dreamed of this!\nWhat a fool I have been! How could I have been so thoughtless! Tell me!\"\nshe added, with a little hesitation; \"has he--does he care for you?\"\n\n\"No! no!\" cried Sybil, fairly breaking down into a burst of tears; \"no!\nhe loves you! nobody but you! he never gave a thought to me. I don't\ncare for him so very much,\" she continued, drying her tears; \"only it\nseems so lonely now he is gone.\"\n\nMrs. Lee remained on the couch, with her arm round her sister's\nneck, silent, gazing into vacancy, the picture of perplexity and\nconsternation.\n\nThe situation was getting beyond her control.\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\nIN the middle of April a sudden social excitement started the\nindolent city of Washington to its feet. The Grand-Duke and Duchess of\nSaxe-Baden-Hombourg arrived in America on a tour of pleasure, and in\ndue course came on to pay their respects to the Chief Magistrate of\nthe Union. The newspapers hastened to inform their readers that the\nGrand-Duchess was a royal princess of England, and, in the want of any\nother social event, every one who had any sense of what was due to his\nor her own dignity, hastened to show this august couple the respect\nwhich all republicans who have a large income derived from business,\nfeel for English royalty. New York gave a dinner, at which the most\ninsignificant person present was worth at least a million dollars, and\nwhere the gentlemen who sat by the Princess entertained her for an hour\nor two by a calculation of the aggregate capital represented. New York\nalso gave a ball at which the Princess appeared in an ill-fitting black\nsilk dress with mock lace and jet ornaments, among several hundred\ntoilets that proclaimed the refined republican simplicity of their\nowners at a cost of various hundred thousand dollars. After these\nhospitalities the Grand-ducal pair came on to Washington, where they\nbecame guests of Lord Skye, or, more properly, Lord Skye became their\nguest, for he seemed to consider that he handed the Legation over to\nthem, and he told Mrs. Lee, with true British bluntness of speech,\nthat they were a great bore and he wished they had stayed in\nSaxe-Baden-Hombourg, or wherever they belonged, but as they were here,\nhe must be their lackey. Mrs. Lee was amused and a little astonished at\nthe candour with which he talked about them, and she was instructed\nand improved by his dry account of the Princess, who, it seemed, made\nherself disagreeable by her airs of royalty; who had suffered dreadfully\nfrom the voyage; and who detested America and everything American; but\nwho was, not without some show of reason, jealous of her husband, and\nendured endless sufferings, though with a very bad grace, rather than\nlose sight of him.\n\nNot only was Lord Skye obliged to turn the Legation into an hotel, but\nin the full enthusiasm of his loyalty he felt himself called upon to\ngive a ball. It was, he said, the easiest way of paying off all his\ndebts at once, and if the Princess was good for nothing else, she could\nbe utilized as a show by way of \"promoting the harmony of the two great\nnations.\" In other words, Lord Skye meant to exhibit the Princess for\nhis own diplomatic benefit, and he did so. One would have thought that\nat this season, when Congress had adjourned, Washington would hardly\nhave afforded society enough to fill a ball-room, but this, instead of\nbeing a drawback, was an advantage. It permitted the British Minister to\nissue invitations without limit. He asked not only the President and\nhis Cabinet, and the judges, and the army, and the navy, and all the\nresidents of Washington who had any claim to consideration, but also all\nthe senators, all the representatives in Congress, all the governors\nof States with their staffs, if they had any, all eminent citizens\nand their families throughout the Union and Canada, and finally every\nprivate individual, from the North Pole to the Isthmus of Panama, who\nhad ever shown him a civility or was able to control interest enough\nto ask for a card. The result was that Baltimore promised to come in\na body, and Philadelphia was equally well-disposed; New York provided\nseveral scores of guests, and Boston sent the governor and a delegation;\neven the well-known millionaire who represented California in the United\nStates Senate was irritated because, his invitation having been timed to\narrive just one day too late, he was prevented from bringing his family\nacross the continent with a choice party in a director's car, to\nenjoy the smiles of royalty in the halls of the British lion. It is\nastonishing what efforts freemen will make in a just cause.\n\nLord Skye himself treated the whole affair with easy contempt. One\nafternoon he strolled into Mrs. Lee's parlour and begged her to give him\na cup of tea.\n\nHe said he had got rid of his menagerie for a few hours by shunting\nit off upon the German Legation, and he was by way of wanting a little\nhuman society. Sybil, who was a great favourite with him, entreated to\nbe told all about the ball, but he insisted that he knew no more than\nshe did. A man from New York had taken possession of the Legation, but\nwhat he would do with it was not within the foresight of the wisest;\ntrom the talk of the young members of his Legation, Lord Skye gathered\nthat the entire city was to be roofed in and forty millions of people\nexpected, but his own concern in the affair was limited to the flowers\nhe hoped to receive.\n\n\"All young and beautiful women,\" said he to Sybil, \"are to send me\nflowers. I prefer Jacqueminot roses, but will accept any handsome\nvariety, provided they are not wired. It is diplomatic etiquette that\neach lady who sends me flowers shall reserve at least one dance for me.\nYou will please inscribe this at once upon your tablets, Miss Ross.\"\n\nTo Madeleine this ball was a godsend, for it came just in time to\ndivert Sybil's mind from its troubles. A week had now passed since that\nrevelation of Sybil's heart which had come like an earthquake upon\nMrs. Lee. Since then Sybil had been nervous and irritable, all the more\nbecause she was conscious of being watched. She was in secret ashamed of\nher own conduct, and inclined to be angry with Carrington, as though\nhe were responsible for her foolishness; but she could not talk\nwith Madeleine on the subject without discussing Mr. Ratcliffe, and\nCarrington had expressly forbidden her to attack Mr. Ratcliffe until it\nwas clear that Ratcliffe had laid himself open to attack. This reticence\ndeceived poor Mrs. Lee, who saw in her sister's moods only that\nunrequited attachment for which she held herself solely to blame. Her\ngross negligence in allowing Sybil to be improperly exposed to such\na risk weighed heavily on her mind. With a saint's capacity for\nself-torment, Madeleine wielded the scourge over her own back until the\nblood came. She saw the roses rapidly fading from Sybil's cheeks, and\nby the help of an active imagination she discovered a hectic look\nand symptoms of a cough. She became fairly morbid on the subject,\nand fretted herself into a fever, upon which Sybil sent, on her own\nresponsibility, for the medical man, and Madeleine was obliged to dose\nherself with quinine. In fact, there was much more reason for anxiety\nabout her than for her anxiety about Sybil, who, barring a little\nyouthful nervousness in the face of responsibility, was as healthy\nand comfortable a young woman as could be shown in America, and whose\nsentiment never cost her five minutes' sleep, although her appetite may\nhave become a shade more exacting than before. Madeleine was quick to\nnotice this, and surprised her cook by making daily and almost hourly\ndemands for new and impossible dishes, which she exhausted a library of\ncookery-books to discover.\n\nLord Skye's ball and Sybil's interest in it were a great relief to\nMadeleine's mind, and she now turned her whole soul to frivolity. Never,\nsince she was seventeen, had she thought or talked so much about a ball,\nas now about this ball to the Grand-Duchess. She wore out her own brain\nin the effort to amuse Sybil. She took her to call on the Princess;\nshe would have taken her to call on the Grand Lama had he come to\nWashington. She instigated her to order and send to Lord Skye a mass of\nthe handsomest roses New York could afford. She set her at work on her\ndress several days before there was any occasion for it, and this famous\ncostume had to be taken out, examined, criticised, and discussed with\nunending interest. She talked about the dress, and the Princess, and\nthe ball, till her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth, and her brain\nrefused to act. From morning till night, for one entire week, she ate,\ndrank, breathed, and dreamt of the ball. Everything that love could\nsuggest or labour carry out, she did, to amuse and occupy her sister.\n\nShe knew that all this was only temporary and palliative, and that more\nradical measures must be taken to secure Sybil's happiness. On this\nsubject she thought in secret until both head and heart ached. One thing\nand one thing only was clear: if Sybil loved Carrington, she should\nhave him. How Madeleine expected to bring about this change of heart\nin Carrington, was known only to herself. She regarded men as creatures\nmade for women to dispose of, and capable of being transferred like\nchecks, or baggage-labels, from one woman to another, as desired. The\nonly condition was that he should first be completely disabused of the\nnotion that he could dispose of himself. Mrs. Lee never doubted that she\ncould make Carrington fall in love with Sybil provided she could place\nherself beyond his reach. At all events, come what might, even though\nshe had to accept the desperate alternative offered by Mr. Ratcliffe,\nnothing should be allowed to interfere with Sybil's happiness. And thus\nit was, that, for the first time, Mrs. Lee began to ask herself whether\nit was not better to find the solution of her perplexities in marriage.\n\nWould she ever have been brought to this point without the violent\npressure of her sister's supposed interests? This is one of those\nquestions which wise men will not ask, because it is one which the\nwisest man or woman cannot answer. Upon this theme, an army of ingenious\nauthors have exhausted their ingenuity in entertaining the public, and\ntheir works are to be found at every book-stall. They have decided that\nany woman will, under the right conditions, marry any man at any time,\nprovided her \"higher nature\" is properly appealed to. Only with regret\ncan a writer forbear to moralize on this subject. \"Beauty and the\nBeast,\" \"Bluebeard,\" \"Auld Robin Gray,\" have the double charm to\nauthors of being very pleasant to read, and still easier to dilute with\nsentiment. But at least ten thousand modern writers, with Lord Macaulay\nat their head, have so ravaged and despoiled the region of fairy-stories\nand fables, that an allusion even to the \"Arabian Nights\" is no longer\ndecent. The capacity of women to make unsuitable marriages must be\nconsidered as the corner-stone of society.\n\nMeanwhile the ball had, in truth, very nearly driven all thought of\nCarrington out of Sybil's mind. The city filled again. The streets\nswarmed with fashionable young men and women from the provinces of New\nYork, Philadelphia, and Boston, who gave Sybil abundance of occupation.\nShe received bulletins of the progress of affairs. The President and\nhis wife had consented to be present, out of their high respect for\nHer Majesty the Queen and their desire to see and to be seen. All the\nCabinet would accompany the Chief Magistrate. The diplomatic corps\nwould appear in uniform; so, too, the officers of the army and navy; the\nGovernor-General of Canada was coming, with a staff. Lord Skye remarked\nthat the Governor-General was a flat.\n\nThe day of the ball was a day of anxiety to Sybil, although not on\naccount of Mr. Ratcliffe or of Mr. Carrington, who were of trifling\nconsequence compared with the serious problem now before her. The\nresponsibility of dressing both her sister and herself fell upon Sybil,\nwho was the real author of all Mrs. Lee's millinery triumphs when\nthey now occurred, except that Madeleine managed to put character into\nwhatever she wore, which Sybil repudiated on her own account. On\nthis day Sybil had reasons for special excitement. All winter two new\ndresses, one especially a triumph of Mr.\n\nWorth's art, had lain in state upstairs, and Sybil had waited in vain\nfor an occasion that should warrant the splendour of these garments.\n\nOne afternoon in early June of the preceding summer, Mr. Worth had\nreceived a letter on the part of the reigning favourite of the King\nof Dahomey, directing him to create for her a ball-dress that should\nannihilate and utterly destroy with jealousy and despair the hearts of\nher seventy-five rivals; she was young and beautiful; expense was not a\nconsideration. Such were the words of her chamberlain. All that night,\nthe great genius of the nineteenth century tossed wakefully on his bed\nrevolving the problem in his mind. Visions of flesh-coloured tints shot\nwith blood-red perturbed his brain, but he fought against and dismissed\nthem; that combination would be commonplace in Dahomey. When the first\nrays of sunlight showed him the reflection of his careworn face in the\nplate-glass mirrored ceiling, he rose and, with an impulse of despair,\nflung open the casements. There before his blood-shot eyes lay the pure,\nstill, new-born, radiant June morning. With a cry of inspiration the\ngreat man leaned out of the casement and rapidly caught the details of\nhis new conception. Before ten o'clock he was again at his bureau in\nParis. An imperious order brought to his private room every silk, satin,\nand gauze within the range of pale pink, pale crocus, pale green, silver\nand azure. Then came chromatic scales of colour; combinations meant to\nvulgarise the rainbow; sinfonies and fugues; the twittering of birds and\nthe great peace of dewy nature; maidenhood in her awakening innocence;\n\"The Dawn in June.\" The Master rested content.\n\nA week later came an order from Sybil, including \"an entirely original\nball-dress,--unlike any other sent to America.\" Mr. Worth pondered,\nhesitated; recalled Sybil's figure; the original pose of her head;\nglanced anxiously at the map, and speculated whether the New York Herald\nhad a special correspondent at Dahomey; and at last, with a generosity\npeculiar to great souls, he duplicated for \"Miss S. Ross, New York, U.S.\nAmerica,\" the order for \"L'Aube, Mois de Juin.\"\n\nThe Schneidekoupons and Mr. French, who had reappeared in Washington,\ncame to dine with Mrs. Lee on the evening of the ball, and Julia\nSchneidekoupon sought in vain to discover what Sybil was going to wear.\n\"Be happy, my dear, in your ignorance!\" said Sybil; \"the pangs of envy\nwill rankle soon enough.\"\n\nAn hour later her room, except the fireplace, where a wood fire was\ngently smouldering, became an altar of sacrifice to the Deity of Dawn in\nJune. Her bed, her low couch, her little tables, her chintz arm-chairs,\nwere covered with portions of the divinity, down to slippers and\nhandkerchief, gloves and bunches of fresh roses. When at length, after\na long effort, the work was complete, Mrs. Lee took a last critical\nlook at the result, and enjoyed a glow of satisfaction. Young, happy,\nsparkling with consciousness of youth and beauty, Sybil stood, Hebe\nAnadyomene, rising from the foam of soft creplisse which swept back\nbeneath the long train of pale, tender, pink silk, fainting into\nbreadths of delicate primrose, relieved here and there by facings of\nJune green--or was it the blue of early morning?--or both? suggesting\nunutterable freshness. A modest hint from her maid that \"the girls,\"\nas women-servants call each other in American households, would like to\noffer their share of incense at the shrine, was amiably met, and they\nwere allowed a glimpse of the divinity before she was enveloped in\nwraps. An admiring group, huddled in the doorway, murmured approval,\nfrom the leading \"girl,\" who was the cook, a coloured widow of some\nsixty winters, whose admiration was irrepressible, down to a New England\nspinster whose Anabaptist conscience wrestled with her instincts, and\nwho, although disapproving of \"French folks,\" paid in her heart that\nsecret homage to their gowns and bonnets which her sterner lips refused.\nThe applause of this audience has, from generation to generation,\ncheered the hearts of myriads of young women starting out on their\nlittle adventures, while the domestic laurels flourish green and fresh\nfor one half hour, until they wither at the threshold of the ball-room.\n\nMrs. Lee toiled long and earnestly over her sister's toilet, for had not\nshe herself in her own day been the best-dressed girl in New York?--at\nleast, she held that opinion, and her old instincts came to life again\nwhenever Sybil was to be prepared for any great occasion. Madeleine\nkissed her sister affectionately, and gave her unusual praise when\nthe \"Dawn in June\" was complete. Sybil was at this moment the ideal of\nblooming youth, and Mrs. Lee almost dared to hope that her heart was\nnot permanently broken, and that she might yet survive until Carrington\ncould be brought back. Her own toilet was a much shorter affair, but\nSybil was impatient long before it was concluded; the carriage was\nwaiting, and she was obliged to disappoint her household by coming down\nenveloped in her long opera-cloak, and hurrying away.\n\nWhen at length the sisters entered the reception-room at the British\nLegation, Lord Skye rebuked them for not having come early to receive\nwith him. His Lordship, with a huge riband across his breast, and a star\non his coat, condescended to express himself vigorously on the subject\nof the \"Dawn in June.\" Schneidekoupon, who was proud of his easy use\nof the latest artistic jargon, looked with respect at Mrs. Lee's\nsilver-gray satin and its Venetian lace, the arrangement of which\nhad been conscientiously stolen from a picture in the Louvre, and\nhe murmured audibly, \"Nocturne in silver-gray!\"--then, turning to\nSybil--\"and you? Of course! I see! A song without words!\" Mr. French\ncame up and, in his most fascinating tones, exclaimed, \"Why, Mrs. Lee,\nyou look real handsome to-night!\" Jacobi, after a close scrutiny, said\nthat he took the liberty of an old man in telling them that they were\nboth dressed absolutely without fault. Even the Grand-Duke was struck\nby Sybil, and made Lord Skye introduce him, after which ceremony he\nterrified her by asking the pleasure of a waltz. She disappeared from\nMadeleine's view, not to be brought back again until Dawn met dawn.\n\nThe ball was, as the newspapers declared, a brilliant success. Every one\nwho knows the city of Washington will recollect that, among some scores\nof magnificent residences which our own and foreign governments have\nbuilt for the comfort of cabinet officers, judges, diplomatists,\nvice-presidents, speakers, and senators, the British Legation is by far\nthe most impressive.\n\nCombining in one harmonious whole the proportions of the Pitti Palace\nwith the decoration of the Casa d'Oro and the dome of an Eastern Mosque,\nthis architectural triumph offers extraordinary resources for society.\nFurther description is unnecessary, since anyone may easily refer back\nto the New York newspapers of the following morning, where accurate\nplans of the house on the ground floor, will be found; while the\nillustrated newspapers of the same week contain excellent sketches of\nthe most pleasing scenic effects, as well as of the ball-room and of the\nPrincess smiling graciously from her throne. The lady just behind\nthe Princess on her left, is Mrs. Lee, a poor likeness, but easily\ndistinguishable from the fact that the artist, for his own objects,\nhas made her rather shorter, and the Princess rather taller, than was\nstrictly correct, just as he has given the Princess a gracious smile,\nwhich was quite different from her actual expression. In short, the\nartist is compelled to exhibit the world rather as we would wish it to\nbe, than as it was or is, or, indeed, is like shortly to become. The\nstrangest part of his picture is, however, the fact that he actually did\nsee Mrs. Lee where he has put her, at the Princess's elbow, which was\nalmost the last place in the room where any one who knew Mrs. Lee would\nhave looked for her.\n\nThe explanation of this curious accident shall be given immediately,\nsince the facts are not mentioned in the public reports of the\nball, which only said that, \"close behind her Royal Highness the\nGrand-Duchess, stood our charming and aristocratic countrywoman, Mrs.\nLightfoot Lee, who has made so great a sensation in Washington this\nwinter, and whose name public rumour has connected with that of the\nSecretary of the Treasury. To her the Princess appeared to address most\nof her conversation.\"\n\nThe show was a very pretty one, and on a pleasant April evening there\nwere many places less agreeable to be in than this. Much ground outside\nhad been roofed over, to make a ball-room, large as an opera-house, with\na da\u00c3\u00afs and a sofa in the centre of one long side, and another da\u00c3\u00afs with\na second sofa immediately opposite to it in the centre of the other long\nside. Each da\u00c3\u00afs had a canopy of red velvet, one bearing the Lion and the\nUnicorn, the other the American Eagle. The Royal Standard was displayed\nabove the Unicorn; the Stars-and-Stripes, not quite so effectively,\nwaved above the Eagle. The Princess, being no longer quite a child,\nfound gas trying to her complexion, and compelled Lord Skye to\nilluminate her beauty by one hundred thousand wax candies, more or less,\nwhich were arranged to be becoming about the Grand-ducal throne, and to\nbe showy and unbecoming about the opposite institution across the way.\n\nThe exact facts were these. It had happened that the Grand-Duchess,\nhaving been necessarily brought into contact with the President, and\nparticularly with his wife, during the past week, had conceived for\nthe latter an antipathy hardly to be expressed in words. Her fixed\ndetermination was at any cost to keep the Presidential party at a\ndistance, and it was only after a stormy scene that the Grand-Duke and\nLord Skye succeeded in extorting her consent that the President should\ntake her to supper. Further than this she would not go. She would not\nspeak to \"that woman,\" as she called the President's wife, nor be in her\nneighbourhood. She would rather stay in her own room all the evening,\nand she did not care in the least what the Queen would think of it,\nfor she was no subject of the Queen's. The case was a hard one for Lord\nSkye, who was perplexed to know, from this point of view, why he was\nentertaining the Princess at all; but, with the help of the Grand-Duke\nand Lord Dunbeg, who was very active and smiled deprecation with some\nsuccess, he found a way out of it; and this was the reason why there\nwere two thrones in the ball-room, and why the British throne was\nlighted with such careful reference to the Princess's complexion. Lord\nSkye immolated himself in the usual effort of British and American\nMinisters, to keep the two great powers apart. He and the Grand-Duke\nand Lord Dunbeg acted as buffers with watchful diligence, dexterity, and\nsuccess. As one resource, Lord Skye had bethought himself of Mrs. Lee,\nand he told the Princess the story of Mrs. Lee's relations with the\nPresident's wife, a story which was no secret in Washington, for, apart\nfrom Madeleine's own account, society was left in no doubt of the light\nin which Mrs. Lee was regarded by the mistress of the White House, whom\nWashington ladles were now in the habit of drawing out on the subject\nof Mrs. Lee, and who always rose to the bait with fresh vivacity, to the\namusement and delight of Victoria Dare and other mischief-makers.\n\n\"She will not trouble you so long as you can keep Mrs. Lee in your\nneighbourhood,\" said Lord Skye, and the Princess accordingly seized upon\nMrs. Lee and brandished her, as though she were a charm against the\nevil eye, in the face of the President's party. She made Mrs. Lee take\na place just behind her as though she were a lady-in-waiting. She even\ngraciously permitted her to sit down, so near that their chairs touched.\nWhenever \"that woman\" was within sight, which was most of the time, the\nPrincess directed her conversation entirely to Mrs. Lee and took care\nto make it evident. Even before the Presidential party had arrived,\nMadeleine had fallen into the Princess's grasp, and when the Princess\nwent forward to receive the President and his wife, which she did with a\nbow of stately and distant dignity, she dragged Madeleine closely by her\nside. Mrs. Lee bowed too; she could not well help it; but was cut dead\nfor her pains, with a glare of contempt and hatred. Lord Skye, who was\nacting as cavalier to the President's wife, was panic-stricken, and\nhastened to march his democratic potentate away, under pretence of\nshowing her the decorations. He placed her at last on her own throne,\nwhere he and the Grand-Duke relieved each other in standing guard at\nintervals throughout the evening. When the Princess followed with the\nPresident, she compelled her husband to take Mrs. Lee on his arm\nand conduct her to the British throne, with no other object than to\nexasperate the President's wife, who, from her elevated platform, looked\ndown upon the cort\u00c3\u00a8ge with a scowl.\n\nIn all this affair Mrs. Lee was the principal sufferer. No one could\nrelieve her, and she was literally penned in as she sat. The Princess\nkept up an incessant fire of small conversation, principally complaint\nand fault-finding, which no one dared to interrupt. Mrs. Lee was\npainfully bored, and after a time even the absurdity of the thing ceased\nto amuse her.\n\nShe had, too, the ill-luck to make one or two remarks which appealed\nto some hidden sense of humour in the Princess, who laughed and, in the\nstyle of royal personages, gave her to understand that she would like\nmore amusement of the same sort. Of all things in life, Mrs. Lee held\nthis kind of court-service in contempt, for she was something more\nthan republican--a little communistic at heart, and her only serious\ncomplaint of the President and his wife was that they undertook to have\na court and to ape monarchy.\n\nShe had no notion of admitting social superiority in any one, President\nor Prince, and to be suddenly converted into a lady-in-waiting to a\nsmall German Grand-Duchess, was a terrible blow. But what was to be\ndone? Lord Skye had drafted her into the service and she could not\ndecently refuse to help him when he came to her side and told her,\nwith his usual calm directness, what his difficulties were, and how he\ncounted upon her to help him out.\n\nThe same play went on at supper, where there was a royal-presidential\ntable, which held about two dozen guests, and the two great ladies\npresiding, as far apart as they could be placed. The Grand-Duke and Lord\nSkye, on either side of the President's wife, did their duty like men,\nand were rewarded by receiving from her much information about the\ndomestic arrangements of the White House. The President, however, who\nsat next the Princess at the opposite end, was evidently depressed,\nowing partly to the fact that the Princess, in defiance of all\netiquette, had compelled Lord Dunbeg to take Mrs. Lee to supper and to\nplace her directly next the President. Madeleine tried to escape, but\nwas stopped by the Princess, who addressed her across the President and\nin a decided tone asked her to sit precisely there. Mrs.\n\nLee looked timidly at her neighbour, who made no sign, but ate his\nsupper in silence only broken by an occasional reply to a rare remark.\nMrs. Lee pitied him, and wondered what his wife would say when they\nreached home. She caught Ratcliffe's eye down the table, watching her\nwith a smile; she tried to talk fluently with Dunbeg; but not until\nsupper was long over and two o'clock was at hand; not until the\nPresidential party, under all the proper formalities, had taken their\nleave of the Grand-ducal party; not until Lord Skye had escorted them to\ntheir carriage and returned to say that they were gone, did the Princess\nloose her hold upon Mrs. Lee and allow her to slip away into obscurity.\n\nMeanwhile the ball had gone on after the manner of balls. As Madeleine\nsat in her enforced grandeur she could watch all that passed. She had\nseen Sybil whirling about with one man after another, amid a swarm of\ndancers, enjoying herself to the utmost and occasionally giving a nod\nand a smile to her sister as their eyes met. There, too, was Victoria\nDare, who never appeared flurried even when waltzing with Lord Dunbeg,\nwhose education as a dancer had been neglected. The fact was now fully\nrecognized that Victoria was carrying on a systematic flirtation with\nDunbeg, and had undertaken as her latest duty the task of teaching him\nto waltz. His struggles and her calmness in assisting them commanded\nrespect. On the opposite side of the room, by the republican throne,\nMrs. Lee had watched Mr. Ratcliffe standing by the President, who\nappeared unwilling to let him out of arm's length and who seemed to make\nto him most of his few remarks. Schneidekoupon and his sister were mixed\nin the throng, dancing as though England had never countenanced the\nheresy of free-trade. On the whole, Mrs. Lee was satisfied.\n\nIf her own sufferings were great, they were not without reward. She\nstudied all the women in the ball-room, and if there was one prettier\nthan Sybil, Madeleine's eyes could not discover her. If there was a more\nperfect dress, Madeleine knew nothing of dressing. On these points she\nfelt the confidence of conviction. Her calm would have been complete,\nhad she felt quite sure that none of Sybil's gaiety was superficial and\nthat it would not be followed by reaction. She watched nervously to see\nwhether her face changed its gay expression, and once she thought it\nbecame depressed, but this was when the Grand-Duke came up to claim his\nwaltz, and the look rapidly passed away when they got upon the floor and\nhis Highness began to wheel round the room with a precision and momentum\nthat would have done honour to a regiment of Life Guards. He seemed\npleased with his experiment, for he was seen again and again careering\nover the floor with Sybil until Mrs. Lee herself became nervous, for the\nPrincess frowned.\n\nAfter her release Madeleine lingered awhile in the ball-room to speak\nwith her sister and to receive congratulations. For half an hour she was\na greater belle than Sybil. A crowd of men clustered about her, amused\nat the part she had played in the evening's entertainment and full of\ncompliments upon her promotion at Court. Lord Skye himself found time to\noffer her his thanks in a more serious tone than he generally affected.\n\"You have suffered much,\" said he, \"and I am grateful.\" Madeleine\nlaughed as she answered that her sufferings had seemed nothing to her\nwhile she watched his. But at last she became weary of the noise and\nglare of the ball-room, and, accepting the arm of her excellent friend\nCount Popoff, she strolled with him back to the house. There at last\nshe sat down on a sofa in a quiet window-recess where the light was less\nstrong and where a convenient laurel spread its leaves in front so as\nto make a bower through which she could see the passers-by without being\nseen by them except with an effort. Had she been a younger woman, this\nwould have been the spot for a flirtation, but Mrs. Lee never flirted,\nand the idea of her flirting with Popoff would have seemed ludicrous to\nall mankind.\n\nHe did not sit down, but was leaning against the angle of the wall,\ntalking with her, when suddenly Mr. Ratcliffe appeared and took the seat\nby her side with such deliberation and apparent sense of property that\nPopoff incontinently turned and fled. No one knew where the Secretary\ncame from, or how he learned that she was there. He made no explanation\nand she took care to ask for none. She gave him a highly-coloured\naccount of her evening's service as lady-in-waiting, which he matched\nby that of his own trials as gentleman-usher to the President, who, it\nseemed, had clung desperately to his old enemy in the absence of any\nother rock to clutch at.\n\nRatcliffe looked the character of Prime Minister sufficiently well at\nthis moment. He would have held his own, at a pinch, in any Court, not\nmerely in Europe but in India or China, where dignity is still expected\nof gentlemen.\n\nExcepting for a certain coarse and animal expression about the mouth,\nand an indefinable coldness in the eye, he was a handsome man and still\nin his prime. Every one remarked how much he was improved since entering\nthe Cabinet. He had dropped his senatorial manner. His clothes were no\nlonger congressional, but those of a respectable man, neat and decent.\nHis shirts no longer protruded in the wrong places, nor were his\nshirt-collars frayed or soiled. His hair did not stray over his eyes,\nears, and coat, like that of a Scotch terrier, but had got itself cut.\nHaving overheard Mrs. Lee express on one occasion her opinion of people\nwho did not take a cold bath every morning, he had thought it best to\nadopt this reform, although he would not have had it generally known,\ntot it savoured of caste. He made an effort not to be dictatorial and to\nforget that he had been the Prairie Giant, the bully of the Senate. In\nshort, what with Mrs. Lee's influence and what with his emancipation\nfrom the Senate chamber with its code of bad manners and worse morals,\nMr. Ratcliffe was fast becoming a respectable member of society whom a\nman who had never been in prison or in politics might safely acknowledge\nas a friend.\n\nMr. Ratcliffe was now evidently bent upon being heard. After charting\nfor a time with some humour on the President's successes as a man of\nfashion, he changed the subject to the merits of the President as a\nstatesman, and little by little as he spoke he became serious and his\nvoice sank into low and confidential tones. He plainly said that the\nPresident's incapacity had now become notorious among his followers;\nthat it was only with difficulty his Cabinet and friends could prevent\nhim from making a fool of himself fifty times a day; that all the party\nleaders who had occasion to deal with him were so thoroughly disgusted\nthat the Cabinet had to pass its time in trying to pacify them;\nwhile this state of things lasted, Ratcliffe's own influence must be\nparamount; he had good reason to know that if the Presidential election\nwere to take place this year, nothing could prevent his nomination and\nelection; even at three years' distance the chances in his favour were\nat least two to one; and after this exordium he went on in a low tone\nwith increasing earnestness, while Mrs. Lee sat motionless as the statue\nof Agrippina, her eyes fixed on the ground:\n\n\"I am not one of those who are happy in political life. I am a\npolitician because I cannot help myself; it is the trade I am fittest\nfor, and ambition is my resource to make it tolerable. In politics we\ncannot keep our hands clean. I have done many things in my political\ncareer that are not defensible. To act with entire honesty and\nself-respect, one should always live in a pure atmosphere, and the\natmosphere of politics is impure. Domestic life is the salvation of many\npublic men, but I have for many years been deprived of it. I have now\ncome to that point where increasing responsibilities and temptations\nmake me require help. I must have it. You alone can give it to me. You\nare kind, thoughtful, conscientious, high-minded, cultivated, fitted\nbetter than any woman I ever saw, for public duties. Your place is\nthere. You belong among those who exercise an influence beyond their\ntime. I only ask you to take the place which is yours.\"\n\nThis desperate appeal to Mrs. Lee's ambition was a calculated part of\nRatcliffe's scheme. He was well aware that he had marked high game, and\nthat in proportion to this height must be the power of his lure. Nor was\nhe embarrassed because Mrs. Lee sat still and pale with her eyes fixed\non the ground and her hands twisted together in her lap. The eagle\nthat soars highest must be longer in descending to the ground than the\nsparrow or the partridge. Mrs. Lee had a thousand things to think about\nin this brief time, and yet she found that she could not think at all;\na succession of mere images and fragments of thought passed rapidly over\nher mind, and her will exercised no control upon their order or their\nnature. One of these fleeting reflections was that in all the offers\nof marriage she had ever heard, this was the most unsentimental and\nbusinesslike. As for his appeal to her ambition, it fell quite dead\nupon her ear, but a woman must be more than a heroine who can listen to\nflattery so evidently sincere, from a man who is pre-eminent among\nmen, without being affected by it. To her, however, the great and\noverpowering fact was that she found herself unable to retreat or\nescape; her tactics were disconcerted, her temporary barriers beaten\ndown.\n\nThe offer was made. What should she do with it?\n\nShe had thought for months on this subject without being able to form a\ndecision; what hope was there that she should be able to decide now, in\na ball-room, at a minute's notice? When, as occasionally happens, the\nconflicting sentiments, prejudices, and passions of a lifetime are\ncompressed into a single instant, they sometimes overcharge the mind and\nit refuses to work. Mrs. Lee sat still and let things take their course;\na dangerous expedient, as thousands of women have learned, for it leaves\nthem at the mercy of the strong will, bent upon mastery.\n\nThe music from the ball-room did not stop. Crowds of persons passed by\ntheir retreat. Some glanced in, and not one of these felt a doubt what\nwas going on there. An unmistakeable atmosphere of mystery and intensity\nsurrounded the pair. Ratcliffe's eyes were fixed upon Mrs. Lee, and\nhers on the ground. Neither seemed to speak or to stir. Old Baron\nJacobi, who never failed to see everything, saw this as he went by, and\nejaculated a foreign oath of frightful import. Victoria Dare saw it and\nwas devoured by curiosity to such a point as to be hardly capable of\ncontaining herself.\n\nAfter a silence which seemed interminable, Ratcliffe went on: \"I do\nnot speak of my own feelings because I know that unless compelled by a\nstrong sense of duty, you will not be decided by any devotion of mine.\nBut I honestly say that I have learned to depend on you to a degree I\ncan hardly express; and when I think of what I should be without\nyou, life seems to me so intolerably dark that I am ready to make any\nsacrifice, to accept any conditions that will keep you by my side.\"\n\nMeanwhile Victoria Dare, although deeply interested in what Dunbeg was\ntelling her, had met Sybil and had stopped a single second to whisper in\nher ear: \"You had better look after your sister, in the window, behind\nthe laurel with Mr. Ratcliffe!\" Sybil was on Lord Skye's arm, enjoying\nherself amazingly, though the night was far gone, but when she caught\nVictoria's words, the expression of her face wholly changed. All the\nanxieties and terrors of the last fortnight, came back upon it. She\ndragged Lord Skye across the hall and looked in upon her sister. One\nglance was enough.\n\nDesperately frightened but afraid to hesitate, she went directly up to\nMadeleine who was still sitting like a statue, listening to Ratcliffe's\nlast words. As she hurriedly entered, Mrs. Lee, looking up, caught sight\nof her pale face, and started from her seat.\n\n\"Are you ill, Sybil?\" she exclaimed; \"is anything the matter?\"\n\n\"A little--fatigued,\" gasped Sybil; \"I thought you might be ready to go\nhome.\"\n\n\"I am,\" cried Madeleine; \"I am quite ready. Good evening, Mr. Ratcliffe.\nI will see you to-morrow. Lord Skye, shall I take leave of the\nPrincess?\"\n\n\"The Princess retired half an hour ago,\" replied Lord Skye, who saw the\nsituation and was quite ready to help Sybil; \"let me take you to the\ndressing-room and order your carriage.\" Mr. Ratcliffe found himself\nsuddenly left alone, while Mrs. Lee hurried away, torn by fresh\nanxieties. They had reached the dressing-room and were nearly ready\nto go home, when Victoria Dare suddenly dashed in upon them, with an\nanimation of manner very unusual in her, and, seizing Sybil by the\nhand, drew her into an adjoining room and shut the door. \"Can you keep a\nsecret?\" said she abruptly.\n\n\"What!\" said Sybil, looking at her with open-mouthed interest; \"you\ndon't mean--are you really--tell me, quick!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Victoria relapsing into composure; \"I am engaged!\"\n\n\"To Lord Dunbeg?\"\n\nVictoria nodded, and Sybil, whose nerves were strung to the highest\npitch by excitement, flattery, fatigue, perplexity, and terror, burst\ninto a paroxysm of laughter, that startled even the calm Miss Dare.\n\n\"Poor Lord Dunbeg! don't be hard on him, Victoria!\" she gasped when at\nlast she found breath; \"do you really mean to pass the rest of your life\nin Ireland? Oh, how much you will teach them!\"\n\n\"You forget, my dear,\" said Victoria, who had placidly enthroned herself\non the foot of a bed, \"that I am not a pauper. I am told that Dunbeg\nCastle is a romantic summer residence, and in the dull season we shall\nof course go to London or somewhere. I shall be civil to you when you\ncome over. Don't you think a coronet will look well on me?\"\n\nSybil burst again into laughter so irrepressible and prolonged that\nit puzzled even poor Dunbeg, who was impatiently pacing the corridor\noutside.\n\nIt alarmed Madeleine, who suddenly opened the door. Sybil recovered\nherself, and, her eyes streaming with tears, presented Victoria to her\nsister:\n\n\"Madeleine, allow me to introduce you to the Countess Dunbeg!\"\n\nBut Mrs. Lee was much too anxious to feel any interest in Lady Dunbeg.\nA sudden fear struck her that Sybil was going into hysterics because\nVictoria's engagement recalled her own disappointment. She hurried her\nsister away to the carriage.\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\nTHEY drove home in silence, Mrs. Lee disturbed with anxieties and\ndoubts, partly caused by her sister, partly by Mr. Ratcliffe; Sybil\ndivided between amusement at Victoria's conquest, and alarm at her own\nboldness in meddling with her sister's affairs. Desperation, however,\nwas stronger than fear. She made up her mind that further suspense was\nnot to be endured; she would fight her baffle now before another hour\nwas lost; surely no time could be better. A few moments brought them to\ntheir door. Mrs. Lee had told her maid not to wait for them, and they\nwere alone. The fire was still alive on Madeleine's hearth, and she\nthrew more wood upon it. Then she insisted that Sybil must go to bed at\nonce. But Sybil refused; she felt quite well, she said, and not in the\nleast sleepy; she had a great deal to talk about, and wanted to get it\noff her mind. Nevertheless, her feminine regard for the \"Dawn in June\"\nled her to postpone what she had to say until with Madeleine's help she\nhad laid the triumph of the ball carefully aside; then, putting on her\ndressing-gown, and hastily plunging Carrington's letter into her breast,\nlike a concealed weapon, she hurried back to Madeleine's room and\nestablished herself in a chair before the fire. There, after a moment's\npause, the two women began their long-deferred trial of strength, in\nwhich the match was so nearly equal as to make the result doubtful; for,\nif Madeleine were much the cleverer, Sybil in this case knew much better\nwhat she wanted, and had a clear idea how she meant to gain it, while\nMadeleine, unsuspicious of attack, had no plan of defence at all.\n\n\"Madeleine,\" began Sybil, solemnly, and with a violent palpitation of\nthe heart, \"I want you to tell me something.\"\n\n\"What is it, my child?\" said Mrs. Lee, puzzled, and yet half ready\nto see that there must be some connection between her sister's coming\nquestion and the sudden illness at the ball, which had disappeared as\nsuddenly as it came.\n\n\"Do you mean to marry Mr. Ratcliffe?\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Lee was quite disconcerted by the directness of the attack.\nThis fatal question met her at every turn. Hardly had she succeeded in\nescaping trom it at the ball scarcely an hour ago, by a stroke of good\nfortune for which she now began to see she was indebted to Sybil, and\nhere it was again presented to her face like a pistol. The whole town,\nthen, was asking it.\n\nRatcliffe's offer must have been seen by half Washington, and her reply\nwas awaited by an immense audience, as though she were a political\nreturning-board. Her disgust was intense, and her first answer to Sybil\nwas a quick inquiry:\n\n\"Why do you ask such a question? have you heard anything,--has anyone\ntalked about it to you?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied Sybil; \"but I must know; I can see for myself without\nbeing told, that Mr. Racliffe is trying to make you marry him. I don't\nask out of curiosity; this is something that concerns me nearly as much\nas it does you yourself. Please tell me! don't treat me like a child any\nlonger! let me know what you are thinking about! I am so tired of being\nleft in the dark! You have no idea how much this thing weighs on me. Oh,\nMaude, I shall never be happy again until you trust me about this.\"\n\nMrs. Lee felt a little pang of conscience, and seemed suddenly to\nbecome conscious of a new coil, tightening about her, in this wretched\ncomplication. Unable to see her way, ignorant of her sister's motives,\nurged on by the idea that Sybil's happiness was involved, she was now\ncharged with want of feeling, and called upon for a direct answer to a\nplain question.\n\nHow could she aver that she did not mean to marry Mr. Ratcliffe? to say\nthis would be to shut the door on all the objects she had at heart. If\na direct answer must be given, it was better to say \"Yes!\" and have\nit over; better to leap blindly and see what came of it. Mrs.\nLee, therefore, with an internal gasp, but with no visible sign of\nexcitement, said, as though she were in a dream:\n\n\"Well, Sybil, I will tell you. I would have told you long ago if I had\nknown myself. Yes! I have made up my mind to marry Mr. Ratcliffe!\"\n\nSybil sprang to her feet with a cry: \"And have you told him so?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"No! you came and interrupted us just as we were speaking. I was glad\nyou did come, for it gives me a little time to think. But I am decided\nnow. I shall tell him to-morrow.\"\n\nThis was not said with the air or one whose heart beat warmly at the\nthought of confessing her love. Mrs. Lee spoke mechanically, and almost\nwith an effort. Sybil flung herself with all her energy upon her sister;\nviolently excited, and eager to make herself heard, without waiting\nfor arguments, she broke out into a torrent of entreaties: \"Oh, don't,\ndon't, don't! Oh, please, please, don't, my dearest, dearest Maude!\nunless you want to break my heart, don't marry that man! You can't love\nhim! You can never be happy with him! he will take you away to Peonia,\nand you will die there! I shall never see you again! He will make you\nunhappy; he will beat you, I know he will! Oh, if you care for me at\nall, don't marry him! Send him away! don't see him again! let us go\nourselves, now, in the morning train, before he comes back. I'm\nall ready; I'll pack everything for you; we'll go to Newport; to\nEurope--anywhere, to be out of his reach!\"\n\nWith this passionate appeal, Sybil threw herself on her knees by her\nsister's side, and, clasping her arms around Madeleine's waist, sobbed\nas though her heart were already broken. Had Carrington seen her then\nhe must have admitted that she had carried out his instructions to the\nletter. She was quite honest, too, in it all. She meant what she\nsaid, and her tears were real tears that had been pent up for weeks.\nUnluckily, her logic was feeble. Her idea of Mr. Ratcliffe's character\nwas vague, and biased by mere theories of what a Prairie Giant of\nPeonia should be in his domestic relations. Her idea of Peonia, too,\nwas indistinct. She was haunted by a vision of her sister, sitting on\na horse-hair sofa before an air-tight iron stove in a small room with\nhigh, bare white walls, a chromolithograph on each, and at her side a\nmarble-topped table surmounted by a glass vase containing funereal dried\ngrasses; the only literature, Frank Leslie's periodical and the New York\nLedger, with a strong smell of cooking everywhere prevalent. Here\nshe saw Madeleine receiving visitors, the wives of neighbours and\nconstituents, who told her the Peonia news.\n\nNotwithstanding her ignorant and unreasonable prejudice against western\nmen and women, western towns and prairies, and, in short, everything\nwestern, down to western politics and western politicians, whom she\nperversely asserted to be tue lowest ot all western products, there\nwas still some common sense in Sybil's idea. When that inevitable hour\nstruck for Mr.\n\nRatcliffe, which strikes sooner or later for all politicians, and an\nungrateful country permitted him to pine among his friends in Illinois,\nwhat did he propose to do with his wife? Did he seriously suppose that\nshe, who was bored to death by New York, and had been able to find no\npermanent pleasure in Europe, would live quietly in the romantic village\nof Peonia? If not, did Mr. Ratcliffe imagine that they could find\nhappiness in the enjoyment of each other's society, and of Mrs. Lee's\nincome, in the excitements of Washington? In the ardour of his pursuit,\nMr. Ratcliffe had accepted in advance any conditions which Mrs. Lee\nmight impose, but if he really imagined that happiness and content lay\non the purple rim of this sunset, he had more confidence in women and in\nmoney than a wider experience was ever likely to justify.\n\nWhatever might be Mr. Ratcliffe's schemes for dealing with these\nobstacles they could hardly be such as would satisfy Sybil, who, if\ninaccurate in her theories about Prairie Giants, yet understood women,\nand especially her sister, much better than Mr. Ratcliffe ever could do.\nHere she was safe, and it would have been better had she said no more,\nfor Mrs. Lee, though staggered for a moment by her sister's vehemence,\nwas reassured by what seemed the absurdity of her fears. Madeleine\nrebelled against this hysterical violence of opposition, and became more\nfixed in her decision.\n\nShe scolded her sister in good, set terms--\n\n\"Sybil, Sybil! you must not be so violent. Behave like a woman, and not\nlike a spoiled child!\"\n\nMrs. Lee, like most persons who have to deal with spoiled or unspoiled\nchildren, resorted to severity, not so much because it was the proper\nway of dealing with them, as because she knew not what else to do.\nShe was thoroughly uncomfortable and weary. She was not satisfied with\nherself or with her own motives. Doubt encompassed her on all sides, and\nher worst opponent was that sister whose happiness had turned the scale\nagainst her own judgment.\n\nNevertheless her tactics answered their object of checking Sybil's\nvehemence. Her sobs came to an end, and she presently rose with a\nquieter air.\n\n\"Madeleine,\" said she, \"do you really want to marry Mr. Ratcliffe?\"\n\n\"What else can I do, my dear Sybil? I want to do whatever is for the\nbest. I thought you might be pleased.\"\n\n\"You thought I might be pleased?\" cried Sybil in astonishment. \"What a\nstrange idea! If you had ever spoken to me about it I should have told\nyou that I hate him, and can't understand how you can abide him. But I\nwould rather marry him myself than see you marry him. I know that you\nwill kill yourself with unhappiness when you have done it. Oh, Maude,\nplease tell me that you won't!\" And Sybil began gently sobbing again,\nwhile she caressed her sister.\n\nMrs. Lee was infinitely distressed. To act against the wishes of her\nnearest friends was hard enough, but to appear harsh and unfeeling to\nthe one being whose happiness she had at heart, was intolerable. Yet\nno sensible woman, after saying that she meant to marry a man like Mr.\nRatcliffe, could throw him over merely because another woman chose to\nbehave like a spoiled child.\n\nSybil was more childish than Madeleine herself had supposed. She could\nnot even see where her own interest lay. She knew no more about Mr.\nRatcliffe and the West than if he were the giant of a fairy-story, and\nlived at the top of a bean-stalk. She must be treated as a child; with\ngentleness, affection, forbearance, but with firmness and decision. She\nmust be refused what she asked, for her own good.\n\nThus it came about that at last Mrs. Lee spoke, with an appearance of\ndecision far from representing her internal tremor.\n\n\"Sybil, dear, I have made up my mind to marry Mr. Ratcliffe because\nthere is no other way of making every one happy. You need not be afraid\nof him. He is kind and generous. Besides, I can take care of myself; and\nI will take care of you too. Now let us not discuss it any more. It is\nbroad daylight, and we are both tired out.\"\n\nSybil grew at once perfectly calm, and standing before her sister, as\nthough their r\u00c3\u00b4les were henceforward to be reversed, said:\n\n\"You have really made up your mind, then? Nothing I can say will change\nit?\"\n\nMrs. Lee, looking at her with more surprise than ever, could not force\nherself to speak; but she shook her head slowly and decidedly.\n\n\"Then,\" said Sybil, \"there is only one thing more I can do. You must\nread this!\" and she drew out Carrington's letter, which she held before\nMadeleine's face.\n\n\"Not now, Sybil!\" remonstrated Mrs. Lee, dreading another long struggle.\n\"I will read it after we have had some rest. Go to bed now!\"\n\n\"I do not leave this room, nor will I ever go to bed until you have read\nthat letter,\" answered Sybil, seating herself again before the fire\nwith the resolution of Queen Elizabeth; \"not if I sit here till you are\nmarried. I promised Mr. Carrington that you should read it\ninstantly; it's all I can do now.\" With a sigh, Mrs. Lee drew up the\nwindow-curtain, and in the gray morning light sat down to break the seal\nand read the following letter:--\n\n\"Washington, 2nd April.\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Lee,\n\n\"This letter will only come into your hands in case\nthere should be a necessity for your knowing its contents. Nothing short\nof necessity would excuse my writing it. I have to ask your pardon for\nintruding again upon your private affairs. In this case, if I did not\nintrude, you would have cause for serious complaint against me.\n\n\"You asked me the other day whether I knew anything against Mr.\nRatcliffe which the world did not know, to account for my low opinion of\nhis character. I evaded your question then. I was bound by professional\nrules not to disclose facts that came to me under a pledge of\nconfidence. I am going to violate these rules now, only because I owe\nyou a duty which seems to me to override all others.\n\n\"I do know facts in regard to Mr. Ratcliffe, which have seemed to me to\nwarrant a very low opinion of his character, and to mark him as unfit to\nbe, I will not say your husband, but even your acquaintance.\n\n\"You know that I am executor to Samuel Baker's will. You know who Samuel\nBaker was. You have seen his wife. She has told you herself that I\nassisted her in the examination and destruction of all her husband's\nprivate papers according to his special death-bed request. One of the\nfirst facts I learned from these papers and her explanations, was the\nfollowing.\n\n\"Just eight years ago, the great 'Inter-Oceanic Mail Steamship Company,'\nwished to extend its service round the world, and, in order to do so, it\napplied to Congress for a heavy subsidy. The management of this affair\nwas put into the hands of Mr. Baker, and all his private letters to the\nPresident of the Company, in press copies, as well as the President's\nreplies, came into my possession. Baker's letters were, of course,\nwritten in a sort of cypher, several kinds of which he was in the habit\nof using. He left among his papers a key to this cypher, but Mrs. Baker\ncould have explained it without that help.\n\n\"It appeared from this correspondence that the bill was carried\nsuccessfully through the House, and, on reaching the Senate, was\nreferred to the appropriate Committee. Its ultimate passage was very\ndoubtful; the end of the session was close at hand; the Senate was very\nevenly divided, and the Chairman of the Committee was decidedly hostile.\n\n\"The Chairman of that Committee was Senator Ratcliffe, always mentioned\nby Mr. Baker in cypher, and with every precaution. If you care, however,\nto verify the fact, and to trace the history of the Subsidy Bill through\nall its stages, together with Mr. Ratcliffe's report, remarks, and votes\nupon it, you have only to look into the journals and debates for that\nyear.\n\n\"At last Mr. Baker wrote that Senator Ratcliffe had put the bill in\nhis pocket, and unless some means could be found of overcoming his\nopposition, there would be no report, and the bill would never come to\na vote. All ordinary kinds of argument and influence had been employed\nupon him, and were exhausted. In this exigency Baker suggested that the\nCompany should give him authority to see what money would do, but he\nadded that it would be worse than useless to deal with small sums.\nUnless at least one hundred thousand dollars could be employed, it was\nbetter to leave the thing alone.\n\n\"The next mail authorized him to use any required amount of money not\nexceeding one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Two days later he\nwrote that the bill was reported, and would pass the Senate within\nforty-eight hours; and he congratulated the Company on the fact that he\nhad used only one hundred thousand dollars out of its last credit.\n\n\"The bill was actually reported, passed, and became law as he foretold,\nand the Company has enjoyed its subsidy ever since. Mrs. Baker also\ninformed me that to her knowledge her husband gave the sum mentioned, in\nUnited States Coupon Bonds, to Senator Ratcliffe.\n\n\"This transaction, taken in connection with the tortuousness of his\npublic course, explains the distrust I have always expressed for him.\nYou will, however, understand that all these papers have been destroyed.\nMrs. Baker could never be induced to hazard her own comfort by revealing\nthe facts to the public. The officers of the Company in their own\ninterests would never betray the transaction, and their books were\nundoubtedly so kept as to show no trace of it. If I made this charge\nagainst Mr. Ratcliffe, I should be the only sufferer. He would deny\nand laugh at it. I could prove nothing. I am therefore more directly\ninterested than he is in keeping silence.\n\n\"In trusting this secret to you, I rely firmly upon your mentioning\nit to no one else--not even to your sister. You are at liberty, if you\nwish, to show this letter to one person only--to Mr. Ratcliffe himself.\nThat done, you will, I beg, burn it immediately.\n\n\"With the warmest good wishes, I am,\n\n\"Ever most truly yours,\n\n\"John Carrington.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Lee had finished reading this letter, she remained for some\ntime quite silent, looking out into the square below. The morning had\ncome, and the sky was bright with the fresh April sunlight. She threw\nopen her window, and drew in the soft spring air. She needed all the\npurity and quiet that nature could give, for her whole soul was in\nrevolt, wounded, mortified, exasperated. Against the sentiment of all\nher friends she had insisted upon believing in this man; she had wrought\nherself up to the point of accepting him for her husband; a man who, if\nlaw were the same thing as justice, ought to be in a felon's cell; a man\nwho could take money to betray his trust. Her anger at first swept away\nall bounds. She was impatient for the moment when she should see\nhim again, and tear off his mask. For once she would express all the\nloathing she felt for the whole pack of political hounds. She would see\nwhether the animal was made like other beings; whether he had a sense of\nhonour; a single clean spot in his mind.\n\nThen it occurred to her that after all there might be a mistake; perhaps\nMr.\n\nRatcliffe could explain the charge away. But this thought only laid\nbare another smarting wound in her pride. Not only did she believe the\ncharge, but she believed that Mr. Ratcliffe would defend his act. She\nhad been willing to marry a man whom she thought capable of such a\ncrime, and now she shuddered at the idea that this charge might have\nbeen brought against her husband, and that she could not dismiss it with\ninstant incredulity, with indignant contempt. How had this happened? how\nhad she got into so foul a complication? When she left New York, she had\nmeant to be a mere spectator in Washington. Had it entered her head\nthat she could be drawn into any project of a second marriage, she\nnever would have come at all, for she was proud of her loyalty to her\nhusband's memory, and second marriages were her abhorrence. In her\nrestlessness and solitude, she had forgotten this; she had only asked\nwhether any life was worth living for a woman who had neither husband\nnor children. Was the family all that life had to offer? could she find\nno interest outside the household? And so, led by this will-of-the-wisp,\nshe had, with her eyes open, walked into the quagmire of politics, in\nspite of remonstrance, in spite of conscience.\n\nShe rose and paced the room, while Sybil lay on the couch, watching her\nwith eyes half shut. She grew more and more angry with herself, and as\nher self-reproach increased, her anger against Ratcliffe faded away. She\nhad no right to be angry with Ratcliffe. He had never deceived her.\nHe had always openly enough avowed that he knew no code of morals in\npolitics; that if virtue did not answer his purpose he used vice. How\ncould she blame him for acts which he had repeatedly defended in her\npresence and with her tacit assent, on principles that warranted this or\nany other villainy?\n\nThe worst was that this discovery had come on her as a blow, not as\na reprieve from execution. At this thought she became furious with\nherself.\n\nShe had not known the recesses of her own heart. She had honestly\nsupposed that Sybil's interests and Sybil's happiness were forcing her\nto an act of self-sacrifice; and now she saw that in the depths of\nher soul very different motives had been at work: ambition, thirst for\npower, restless eagerness to meddle in what did not concern her, blind\nlonging to escape from the torture of watching other women with full\nlives and satisfied instincts, while her own life was hungry and sad.\nFor a time she had actually, unconscious as she was of the delusion,\nhugged a hope that a new field of usefulness was open to her; that great\nopportunities for doing good were to supply the aching emptiness of that\ngood which had been taken away; and that here at last was an object\nfor which there would be almost a pleasure in squandering the rest of\nexistence even if she knew in advance that the experiment would fail.\nLife was emptier than ever now that this dream was over. Yet the worst\nwas not in that disappointment, but in the discovery of her own weakness\nand self-deception.\n\nWorn out by long-continued anxiety, excitement and sleeplessness, she\nwas unfit to struggle with the creatures of her own imagination. Such a\nstrain could only end in a nervous crisis, and at length it came:\n\n\"Oh, what a vile thing life is!\" she cried, throwing up her arms with a\ngesture of helpless rage and despair. \"Oh, how I wish I were dead! how\nI wish the universe were annihilated!\" and she flung herself down by\nSybil's side in a frenzy of tears.\n\nSybil, who had watched all this exhibition in silence, waited quietly\nfor the excitement to pass. There was little to say. She could only\nsoothe.\n\nAfter the paroxysm had exhausted itself Madeleine lay quiet for a time,\nuntil other thoughts began to disturb her. From reproaching herself\nabout Ratcliffe she went on to reproach herself about Sybil, who really\nlooked worn and pale, as though almost overcome by fatigue.\n\n\"Sybil,\" said she, \"you must go to bed at once. You are tired out. It\nwas very wrong in me to let you sit up so late. Go now, and get some\nsleep.\"\n\n\"I am not going to bed till you do, Maude!\" replied Sybil, with quiet\nobstinacy.\n\n\"Go, dear! it is all settled. I shall not marry Mr. Ratcliffe. You need\nnot be anxious about it any more.\"\n\n\"Are you very unhappy?\"\n\n\"Only very angry with myself. I ought to have taken Mr. Carrington's\nadvice sooner.\"\n\n\"Oh, Maude!\" exclaimed Sybil, with a sudden explosion of energy; \"I wish\nyou had taken him!\"\n\nThis remark roused Mrs. Lee to new interest: \"Why, Sybil,\" said she,\n\"surely you are not in earnest?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am,\" replied Sybil, very decidedly. \"I know you think I am\nin love with Mr. Carrington myself, but I'm not. I would a great deal\nrather have him for a brother-in-law, and he is so much the nicest man\nyou know, and you could help his sisters.\"\n\nMrs. Lee hesitated a moment, for she was not quite certain whether it\nwas wise to probe a healing wound, but she was anxious to clear this\nlast weight from her mind, and she dashed recklessly forward:\n\n\"Are you sure you are telling the truth, Sybil? Why, then, did you say\nthat you cared for him? and why have you been so miserable ever since he\nwent away?\"\n\n\"Why? I should think it was plain enough why! Because I thought, as\nevery one else did, that you were going to marry Mr. Ratcliffe; and\nbecause if you married Mr. Ratcliffe, I must go and live alone; and\nbecause you treated me like a child, and never took me into your\nconfidence at all; and because Mr. Carrington was the only person I had\nto advise me, and after he went away, I was left all alone to fight Mr.\nRatcliffe and you both together, without a human soul to help me in case\nI made a mistake. You would have been a great deal more miserable than I\nif you had been in my place.\"\n\nMadeleine looked at her for a moment in doubt. Would this last? did\nSybil herself know the depth of her own wound? But what could Mrs. Lee\ndo now?\n\nPerhaps Sybil did deceive herself a little. When this excitement had\npassed away, perhaps Carrington's image might recur to her mind a little\ntoo often for her own comfort. The future must take care of itself.\nMrs. Lee drew her sister closer to her, and said: \"Sybil, I have made a\nhorrible mistake, and you must forgive me.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\nNOT until afternoon did Mrs. Lee reappear. How much she had slept she\ndid not say, and she hardly looked like one whose slumbers had been long\nor sweet; but if she had slept little, she had made up for the loss\nby thinking much, and, while she thought, the storm which had raged so\nfiercely in her breast, more and more subsided into calm. If there was\nnot sunshine yet, there was at least stillness. As she lay, hour after\nhour, waiting for the sleep that did not come, she had at first the keen\nmortification of reflecting how easily she had been led by mere vanity\ninto imagining that she could be of use in the world. She even smiled\nin her solitude at the picture she drew of herself, reforming Ratcliffe,\nand Krebs, and Schuyler Clinton. The ease with which Ratcliffe alone had\ntwisted her about his finger, now that she saw it, made her writhe, and\nthe thought of what he might have done, had she married him, and of\nthe endless succession of moral somersaults she would have had to turn,\nchilled her with mortal terror. She had barely escaped being dragged\nunder the wheels of the machine, and so coming to an untimely end. When\nshe thought of this, she felt a mad passion to revenge herself on the\nwhole race of politicians, with Ratcliffe at their head; she passed\nhours in framing bitter speeches to be made to his face.\n\nThen as she grew calmer, Ratcliffe's sins took on a milder hue; life,\nafter all, had not been entirely blackened by his arts; there was even\nsome good in her experience, sharp though it were. Had she not come to\nWashington in search of men who cast a shadow, and was not Ratcliffe's\nshadow strong enough to satisfy her? Had she not penetrated the deepest\nrecesses of politics, and learned how easily the mere possession of\npower could convert the shadow of a hobby-horse existing only in the\nbrain of a foolish country farmer, into a lurid nightmare that convulsed\nthe sleep of nations? The antics of Presidents and Senators had been\namusing--so amusing that she had nearly been persuaded to take part in\nthem. She had saved herself in time.\n\nShe had got to the bottom of this business of democratic government, and\nfound out that it was nothing more than government of any other kind.\nShe might have known it by her own common sense, but now that experience\nhad proved it, she was glad to quit the masquerade; to return to the\ntrue democracy of life, her paupers and her prisons, her schools and her\nhospitals. As for Mr. Ratcliffe, she felt no difficulty in dealing with\nhim.\n\nLet Mr. Ratcliffe, and his brother giants, wander on their own political\nprairie, and hunt for offices, or other profitable game, as they would.\n\nTheir objects were not her objects, and to join their company was not\nher ambition. She was no longer very angry with Mr. Ratcliffe. She had\nno wish to insult him, or to quarrel with him. What he had done as a\npolitician, he had done according to his own moral code, and it was not\nher business to judge him; to protect herself was the only right she\nclaimed. She thought she could easily hold him at arm's length, and\nalthough, if Carrington had written the truth, they could never again be\nfriends, there need be no difficulty in their remaining acquaintances.\nIf this view of her duty was narrow, it was at least proof that she had\nlearned something from Mr.\n\nRatcliffe; perhaps it was also proof that she had yet to learn Mr.\nRatcliffe himself.\n\nTwo o'clock had struck before Mrs. Lee came down from her chamber, and\nSybil had not yet made her appearance. Madeleine rang her bell and gave\norders that, if Mr. Ratcliffe called she would see him, but she was at\nhome to no one else. Then she sat down to write letters and to prepare\nfor her journey to New York, for she must now hasten her departure in\norder to escape the gossip and criticism which she saw hanging like an\navalanche over her head.\n\nWhen Sybil at length came down, looking much fresher than her sister,\nthey passed an hour together arranging this and other small matters, so\nthat both of them were again in the best of spirits, and Sybil's face\nwas wreathed in smiles.\n\nA number of visitors came to the door that day, some of them prompted\nby friendliness and some by sheer curiosity, for Mrs. Lee's abrupt\ndisappearance from the ball had excited remark. Against all these her\ndoor was firmly closed. On the other hand, as the afternoon went on, she\nsent Sybil away, so that she might have the field entirely to herself,\nand Sybil, relieved of all her alarms, sallied out to interrupt Dunbeg's\nlatest interview with his Countess, and to amuse herself with Victoria's\nlast \"phase.\"\n\nTowards four o'clock the tall form of Mr. Ratcliffe was seen to issue\nfrom the Treasury Department and to descend the broad steps of its\nwestern front.\n\nTurning deliberately towards the Square, the Secretary of the Treasury\ncrossed the Avenue and stopping at Mrs. Lee's door, rang the bell. He\nwas immediately admitted. Mrs. Lee was alone in her parlour and rose\nrather gravely as he entered, but welcomed him as cordially as she\ncould. She wanted to put an end to his hopes at once and to do it\ndecisively, but without hurting his feelings.\n\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe,\" said she, when he was seated--\"I am sure you will be\nbetter pleased by my speaking instantly and frankly. I could not reply\nto you last night. I will do so now without delay. What you wish is\nimpossible. I would rather not even discuss it. Let us leave it here and\nreturn to our old relations.\"\n\nShe could not force herself to express any sense of gratitude for his\naffection, or of regret at being obliged to meet it with so little\nreturn.\n\nTo treat him with tolerable civility was all she thought required of\nher.\n\nRatcliffe felt the change of manner. He had been prepared for a\nstruggle, but not to be met with so blunt a rebuff at the start. His\nlook became serious and he hesitated a moment before speaking, but when\nhe spoke at last, it was with a manner as firm and decided as that of\nMrs. Lee herself.\n\n\"I cannot accept such an answer. I will not say that I have a right to\nexplanation,--I have no rights which you are bound to respect,--but from\nyou I conceive that I may at least ask the favour of one, and that you\nwill not refuse it. Are you willing to tell me your reasons for this\nabrupt and harsh decision?\"\n\n\"I do not dispute your right of explanation, Mr. Ratcliffe. You have\nthe right, if you choose to use it, and I am ready to give you every\nexplanation in my power; but I hope you will not insist on my doing so.\nIf I seemed to speak abruptly and harshly, it was merely to spare you\nthe greater annoyance of doubt. Since I am forced to give you pain, was\nit not fairer and more respectful to you to speak at once? We have been\nfriends. I am very soon going away. I sincerely want to avoid saying or\ndoing anything that would change our relations.\"\n\nRatcliffe, however, paid no attention to these words, and gave them no\nanswer. He was much too old a debater to be misled by such trifles, when\nhe needed all his faculties to pin his opponent to the wall. He asked:--\n\n\"Is your decision a new one?\"\n\n\"It is a very old one, Mr. Ratcliffe, which I had let myself lose sight\nof, for a time. A night's reflection has brought me back to it.\"\n\n\"May I ask why you have returned to it? surely you would not have\nhesitated without strong reasons.\"\n\n\"I will tell you frankly. If, by appearing to hesitate, I have misled\nyou, I am honestly sorry for it. I did not mean to do it. My hesitation\nwas owing to the doubt whether my life might not really be best used\nin aiding you. My decision was owing to the certainty that we are not\nfitted for each other. Our lives run in separate grooves. We are both\ntoo old to change them.\"\n\nRatcliffe shook his head with an air of relief. \"Your reasons, Mrs. Lee,\nare not sound. There is no such divergence in our lives. On the contrary\nI can give to yours the field it needs, and that it can get in no other\nway; while you can give to mine everything it now wants. If these are\nyour only reasons I am sure of being able to remove them.\"\n\nMadeleine looked as though she were not altogether pleased at this idea,\nand became a little dogmatic. \"It is no use our arguing on this subject,\nMr. Ratcliffe. You and I take very different views of life. I cannot\naccept yours, and you could not practise on mine.\"\n\n\"Show me,\" said Ratcliffe, \"a single example of such a divergence, and I\nwill accept your decision without another word.\"\n\nMrs. Lee hesitated and looked at him for an instant as though to be\nquite sure that he was in earnest. There was an effrontery about this\nchallenge which surprised her, and if she did not check it on the spot,\nthere was no saying how much trouble it might give her. Then unlocking\nthe drawer of the writing-desk at her elbow, she took out Carrington's\nletter and handed it to Mr. Ratcliffe.\n\n\"Here is such an example which has come to my knowledge very lately. I\nmeant to show it to you in any case, but I would rather have waited.\"\n\nRatcliffe took the letter which she handed to him, opened it\ndeliberately, looked at the signature, and read. He showed no sign of\nsurprise or disturbance. No one would have imagined that he had, from\nthe moment he saw Carrington's name, as precise a knowledge of what was\nin this letter as though he had written it himself. His first sensation\nwas only one of anger that his projects had miscarried. How this had\nhappened he could not at once understand, for the idea that Sybil could\nhave a hand in it did not occur to him. He had made up his mind that\nSybil was a silly, frivolous girl, who counted for nothing in her\nsister's actions. He had fallen into the usual masculine blunder of\nmixing up smartness of intelligence with strength of character. Sybil,\nwithout being a metaphysician, willed anything which she willed at all\nwith more energy than her sister did, who was worn out with the effort\nof life. Mr. Ratcliffe missed this point, and was left to wonder who\nit was that had crossed his path, and how Carrington had managed to\nbe present and absent, to get a good office in Mexico and to baulk his\nschemes in Washington, at the same time. He had not given Carrington\ncredit for so much cleverness.\n\nHe was violently irritated at the check. Another day, he thought, would\nhave made him safe on this side; and possibly he was right. Had he once\nsucceeded in getting ever so slight a hold on Mrs. Lee he would have\ntold her this story with his own colouring, and from his own point of\nview, and he fully believed he could do this in such a way as to rouse\nher sympathy. Now that her mind was prejudiced, the task would be much\nmore difficult; yet he did not despair, for it was his theory that Mrs.\nLee, in the depths of her soul, wanted to be at the head of the White\nHouse as much as he wanted to be there himself, and that her apparent\ncoyness was mere feminine indecision in the face of temptation. His\nthoughts now turned upon the best means of giving again the upper hand\nto her ambition. He wanted to drive Carrington a second time from the\nfield.\n\nThus it was that, having read the letter once in order to learn what was\nin it, he turned back, and slowly read it again in order to gain time.\nThen he replaced it in its envelope, and returned it to Mrs. Lee, who,\nwith equal calmness, as though her interest in it were at an end,\ntossed it negligently into the fire, where it was reduced to ashes under\nRatcliffe's eyes.\n\nHe watched it burn for a moment, and then turning to her, said, with his\nusual composure, \"I meant to have told you of that affair myself. I am\nsorry that Mr. Carrington has thought proper to forestall me. No doubt\nhe has his own motives for taking my character in charge.\"\n\n\"Then it is true!\" said Mrs. Lee, a little more quickly than she had\nmeant to speak.\n\n\"True in its leading facts; untrue in some of its details, and in the\nimpression it creates. During the Presidential election which took place\neight years ago last autumn, there was, as you may remember, a violent\ncontest and a very close vote. We believed (though I was not so\nprominent in the party then as now), that the result of that election\nwould be almost as important to the nation as the result of the\nwar itself. Our defeat meant that the government must pass into\nthe blood-stained hands of rebels, men whose designs were more than\ndoubtful, and who could not, even if their designs had been good,\nrestrain the violence of their followers. In consequence we strained\nevery nerve. Money was freely spent, even to an amount much in excess of\nour resources. How it was employed, I will not say.\n\n\"I do not even know, for I held myself aloof from these details, which\nfell to the National Central Committee of which I was not a member.\nThe great point was that a very large sum had been borrowed on pledged\nsecurities, and must be repaid. The members of the National Committee\nand certain senators held discussions on the subject, in which I shared.\nThe end was that towards the close of the session the head of the\ncommittee, accompanied by two senators, came to me and told me that I\nmust abandon my opposition to the Steamship Subsidy. They made no open\navowal of their reasons, and I did not press for one. Their declaration,\nas the responsible heads of the organization, that certain action on my\npart was essential to the interests of the party, satisfied me. I did\nnot consider myself at liberty to persist in a mere private opinion in\nregard to a measure about which I recognized the extreme likelihood of\nmy being in error. I accordingly reported the bill, and voted for it, as\ndid a large majority of the party. Mrs. Baker is mistaken in saying\nthat the money was paid to me. If it was paid at all, of which I have no\nknowledge except from this letter, it was paid to the representative of\nthe National Committee. I received no money. I had nothing to do with\nthe money further than as I might draw my own conclusions in regard to\nthe subsequent payment of the campaign debt.\"\n\nMrs. Lee listened to all this with intense interest. Not until this\nmoment had she really felt as though she had got to the heart of\npolitics, so that she could, like a physician with his stethoscope,\nmeasure the organic disease. Now at last she knew why the pulse beat\nwith such unhealthy irregularity, and why men felt an anxiety which they\ncould not or would not explain. Her interest in the disease overcame\nher disgust at the foulness of the revelation. To say that the\ndiscovery gave her actual pleasure would be doing her injustice; but the\nexcitement of the moment swept away every other sensation. She did not\neven think of herself. Not until afterwards did she fairly grasp the\nabsurdity of Ratcliffe's wish that in the face of such a story as this,\nshe should still have vanity enough to undertake the reform of politics.\nAnd with his aid too! The audacity of the man would have seemed sublime\nif she had felt sure that he knew the difference between good and evil,\nbetween a lie and the truth; but the more she saw of him, the surer she\nwas that his courage was mere moral paralysis, and that he talked about\nvirtue and vice as a man who is colour-blind talks about red and green;\nhe did not see them as she saw them; if left to choose for himself he\nwould have nothing to guide him. Was it politics that had caused this\natrophy of the moral senses by disuse? Meanwhile, here she sat face to\nface with a moral lunatic, who had not even enough sense of humour to\nsee the absurdity of his own request, that she should go out to the\nshore of this ocean of corruption, and repeat the ancient r\u00c3\u00b4le of King\nCanute, or Dame Partington with her mop and her pail. What was to be\ndone with such an animal?\n\nThe bystander who looked on at this scene with a wider knowledge of\nfacts, might have found entertainment in another view of the subject,\nthat is to say, in the guilelessness ot Madeleine Lee. With all her\nwarnings she was yet a mere baby-in-arms in the face of the great\npolitician. She accepted his story as true, and she thought it as bad as\npossible; but had Mr.\n\nRatcliffe's associates now been present to hear his version of it, they\nwould have looked at each other with a smile of professional pride, and\nwould have roundly sworn that he was, beyond a doubt, the ablest man\nthis country had ever produced, and next to certain of being President.\nThey would not, however, have told their own side of the story if they\ncould have helped it, but in talking it over among themselves they might\nhave assumed the facts to have been nearly as follows: that Ratcliffe\nhad dragged them into an enormous expenditure to carry his own State,\nand with it his own re-election to the Senate; that they had tried to\nhold him responsible, and he had tried to shirk the responsibility;\nthat there had been warm discussions on the subject; that he himself\nhad privately suggested recourse to Baker, had shaped his conduct\naccordingly, and had compelled them, in order to save their own credit,\nto receive the money.\n\nEven if Mrs. Lee had heard this part of the story, though it might\nhave sharpened her indignation against Mr. Ratcliffe, it would not have\naltered her opinions. As it was, she had heard enough, and with a great\neffort to control her expression of disgust, she sank back in her chair\nas Ratcliffe concluded. Finding that she did not speak, he went on:\n\n\"I do not undertake to defend this affair. It is the act of my public\nlife which I most regret--not the doing, but the necessity of doing. I\ndo not differ from you in opinion on that point. I cannot acknowledge\nthat there is here any real divergence between us.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Mrs. Lee, \"that I cannot agree with you.\"\n\nThis brief remark, the very brevity of which carried a barb of sarcasm,\nescaped from Madeleine's lips before she had fairly intended it.\nRatcliffe felt the sting, and it started him from his studied calmness\nof manner.\n\nRising from his chair he stood on the hearthrug before Mrs. Lee, and\nbroke out upon her with an oration in that old senatorial voice and\nstyle which was least calculated to enlist her sympathies:\n\n\"Mrs. Lee,\" said he, with harsh emphasis and dogmatic tone, \"there are\nconflicting duties in all the transactions of life, except the simplest.\nHowever we may act, do what we may, we must violate some moral\nobligation. All that can be asked of us is that we should guide\nourselves by what we think the highest. At the time this affair\noccurred, I was a Senator of the United States. I was also a trusted\nmember of a great political party which I looked upon as identical with\nthe nation. In both capacities I owed duties to my constituents, to the\ngovernment, to the people. I might interpret these duties narrowly or\nbroadly. I might say: Perish the government, perish the Union, perish\nthis people, rather than that I should soil my hands! Or I might say, as\nI did, and as I would say again: Be my fate what it may, this glorious\nUnion, the last hope of suffering humanity, shall be preserved.\"\n\nHere he paused, and seeing that Mrs. Lee, after looking for a time at\nhim, was now regarding the fire, lost in meditation over the strange\nvagaries of the senatorial mind, he resumed, in another line of\nargument. He rightly judged that there must be some moral defect in his\nlast remarks, although he could not see it, which made persistence in\nthat direction useless.\n\n\"You ought not to blame me--you cannot blame me justly. It is to your\nsense of justice I appeal. Have I ever concealed from you my opinions on\nthis subject? Have I not on the contrary always avowed them? Did I\nnot here, on this very spot, when challenged once before by this same\nCarrington, take credit for an act less defensible than this? Did I not\ntell you then that I had even violated the sanctity of a great popular\nelection and reversed its result? That was my sole act! In comparison\nwith it, this is a trifle! Who is injured by a steamship company\nsubscribing one or ten hundred thousand dollars to a campaign fund?\nWhose rights are affected by it? Perhaps its stock holders receive one\ndollar a share in dividends less than they otherwise would. If they\ndo not complain, who else can do so? But in that election I deprived a\nmillion people of rights which belonged to them as absolutely as their\nhouses! You could not say that I had done wrong. Not a word of blame or\ncriticism have you ever uttered to me on that account. If there was an\noffence, you condoned it! You certainly led me to suppose that you saw\nnone. Why are you now so severe upon the smaller crime?\"\n\nThis shot struck hard. Mrs. Lee visibly shrank under it, and lost her\ncomposure. This was the same reproach she had made against herself, and\nto which she had been able to find no reply. With some agitation she\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe, pray do me justice! I have tried not to be severe. I\nhave said nothing in the way of attack or blame. I acknowledge that it\nis not my place to stand in judgment over your acts. I have more reason\nto blame myself than you, and God knows I have blamed myself bitterly.\"\nThe tears stood in her eyes as she said these last words, and her voice\ntrembled.\n\nRatcliffe saw that he had gained an advantage, and, sitting down\nnearer to her, he dropped his voice and urged his suit still more\nenergetically:\n\n\"You did me justice then; why not do it now? You were convinced then\nthat I did the best I could. I have always done so. On the other hand\nI have never pretended that all my acts could be justified by abstract\nmorality. Where, then, is the divergence between us?\"\n\nMrs. Lee did not undertake to answer this last argument: she only\nreturned to her old ground. \"Mr. Ratcliffe,\" she said, \"I do not want\nto argue this question. I have no doubt that you can overcome me in\nargument. Perhaps on my side this is a matter of feeling rather than of\nreason, but the truth is only too evident to me that I am not fitted\nfor politics. I should be a drag upon you. Let me be the judge of my own\nweakness! Do not insist upon pressing me, further!\"\n\nShe was ashamed of herself for this appeal to a man whom she could not\nrespect, as though she were a suppliant at his mercy, but she feared the\nreproach of having deceived him, and she tried pitiably to escape it.\n\nRatcliffe was only encouraged by her weakness.\n\n\"I must insist upon pressing it, Mrs. Lee,\" replied he, and he became\nyet more earnest as he went on; \"my future is too deeply involved in\nyour decision to allow of my accepting your answer as final. I need your\naid. There is nothing I will not do to obtain it. Do you require\naffection? mine for you is boundless. I am ready to prove it by a life\nof devotion. Do you doubt my sincerity? test it in whatever way you\nplease. Do you fear being dragged down to the level of ordinary\npoliticians? so far as concerns myself, my great wish is to have your\nhelp in purifying politics. What higher ambition can there be than to\nserve one's country for such an end? Your sense of duty is too keen not\nto feel that the noblest objects which can inspire any woman, combine to\npoint out your course.\"\n\nMrs. Lee was excessively uncomfortable, although not in the least\nshaken.\n\nShe began to see that she must take a stronger tone if she meant to\nbring this importunity to an end, and she answered:--\n\n\"I do not doubt your affection or your sincerity, Mr. Ratcliffe. It\nis myself I doubt. You have been kind enough to give me much of your\nconfidence this winter, and if I do not yet know about politics all that\nis to be known, I have learned enough to prove that I could do nothing\nsillier than to suppose myself competent to reform anything. If I\npretended to think so, I should be a mere worldly, ambitious woman, such\nas people think me. The idea of my purifying politics is absurd. I am\nsorry to speak so strongly, but I mean it. I do not cling very closely\nto life, and do not value my own very highly, but I will not tangle it\nin such a way; I will not share the profits of vice; I am not willing to\nbe made a receiver of stolen goods, or to be put in a position where I\nam perpetually obliged to maintain that immorality is a virtue!\"\n\nAs she went on she became more and more animated and her words took a\nsharper edge than she had intended. Ratcliffe felt it, and showed his\nannoyance. His face grew dark and his eyes looked out at her with their\nugliest expression. He even opened his mouth for an angry retort, but\ncontrolled himself with an effort, and presently resumed his argument.\n\n\"I had hoped,\" he began more solemnly than ever, \"that I should find in\nyou a lofty courage which would disregard such risks. If all the men and\nwomen were to take the tone you have taken, our government would soon\nperish. If you consent to share my career, I do not deny that you may\nfind less satisfaction than I hope, but you will lead a mere death in\nlife if you place yourself like a saint on a solitary column. I plead\nwhat I believe to be your own cause in pleading mine. Do not sacrifice\nyour life!\"\n\nMrs. Lee was in despair. She could not reply what was on her lips, that\nto marry a murderer or a thief was not a sure way of diminishing crime.\nShe had already said something so much like this that she shrank from\nspeaking more plainly. So she fell back on her old theme.\n\n\"We must at all events, Mr. Ratcliffe, use our judgments according to\nour own consciences. I can only repeat now what I said at first. I am\nsorry to seem insensible to your expressions towards me, but I cannot do\nwhat you wish. Let us maintain our old relations if you will, but do not\npress me further on this subject.\"\n\nRatcliffe grew more and more sombre as he became aware that defeat was\nstaring him in the face. He was tenacious of purpose, and he had never\nin his life abandoned an object which he had so much at heart as\nthis. He would not abandon it. For the moment, so completely had the\nfascination of Mrs.\n\nLee got the control of him, he would rather have abandoned the\nPresidency itself than her. He really loved her as earnestly as it was\nin his nature to love anything. To her obstinacy he would oppose\nan obstinacy greater still; but in the meanwhile his attack was\ndisconcerted, and he was at a loss what next to do. Was it not possible\nto change his ground; to offer inducements that would appeal even more\nstrongly to feminine ambition and love of display than the Presidency\nitself? He began again:--\n\n\"Is there no form of pledge I can give you? no sacrifice I can make?\nYou dislike politics. Shall I leave political life? I will do anything\nrather than lose you. I can probably control the appointment of Minister\nto England. The President would rather have me there than here. Suppose\nI were to abandon politics and take the English mission. Would that\nsacrifice not affect you? You might pass four years in London where\nthere would be no politics, and where your social position would be\nthe best in the world; and this would lead to the Presidency almost\nas surely as the other.\" Then suddenly, seeing that he was making no\nheadway, he threw off his studied calmness and broke out in an appeal of\nalmost equally studied violence.\n\n\"Mrs. Lee! Madeleine! I cannot live without you. The sound of your\nvoice--the touch of your hand--even the rustle of your dress--are like\nwine to me. For God's sake, do not throw me over!\"\n\nHe meant to crush opposition by force. More and more vehement as he\nspoke he actually bent over and tried to seize her hand. She drew it\nback as though he were a reptile. She was exasperated by this obstinate\ndisregard of her forbearance, this gross attempt to bribe her with\noffice, this flagrant abandonment of even a pretence of public virtue;\nthe mere thought of his touch on her person was more repulsive than\na loathsome disease. Bent upon teaching him a lesson he would never\nforget, she spoke out abruptly, and with evident signs of contempt in\nher voice and manner:\n\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe, I am not to be bought. No rank, no dignity, no\nconsideration, no conceivable expedient would induce me to change my\nmind. Let us have no more of this!\"\n\nRatcliffe had already been more than once, during this conversation, on\nthe verge of losing his temper. Naturally dictatorial and violent, only\nlong training and severe experience had taught him self-control, and\nwhen he gave way to passion his bursts of fury were still tremendous.\nMrs. Lee's evident personal disgust, even more than her last sharp\nrebuke, passed the bounds of his patience. As he stood before her, even\nshe, high-spirited as she was, and not in a calm frame of mind, felt a\nmomentary shock at seeing how his face flushed, his eyes gleamed, and\nhis hands trembled with rage.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed he, turning upon her with a harshness, almost a\nsavageness, of manner that startled her still more; \"I might have known\nwhat to expect! Mrs. Clinton warned me early. She said then that I\nshould find you a heartless coquette!\"\n\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe!\" exclaimed Madeleine, rising from her chair, and\nspeaking in a warning voice almost as passionate as his own.\n\n\"A heartless coquette!\" he repeated, still more harshly than before;\n\"she said you would do just this! that you meant to deceive me! that you\nlived on flattery! that you could never be anything but a coquette, and\nthat if you married me, I should repent it all my life. I believe her\nnow!\"\n\nMrs. Lee's temper, too, was naturally a high one. At this moment she,\ntoo, was flaming with anger, and wild with a passionate impulse to\nannihilate this man. Conscious that the mastery was in her own hands,\nshe could the more easily control her voice, and with an expression of\nunutterable contempt she spoke her last words to him, words which had\nbeen ringing all day in her ears:\n\n\"Mr. Ratcliffe! I have listened to you with a great deal more patience\nand respect than you deserve. For one long hour I have degraded myself\nby discussing with you the question whether I should marry a man who by\nhis own confession has betrayed the highest trusts that could be placed\nin him, who has taken money for his votes as a Senator, and who is now\nin public office by means of a successful fraud of his own, when in\njustice he should be in a State's prison. I will have no more of this.\nUnderstand, once for all, that there is an impassable gulf between your\nlife and mine. I do not doubt that you will make yourself President, but\nwhatever or wherever you are, never speak to me or recognize me again!\"\n\nHe glared a moment into her face with a sort of blind rage, and seemed\nabout to say more, when she swept past him, and before he realized it,\nhe was alone.\n\nOvermastered by passion, but conscious that he was powerless, Ratcliffe,\nafter a moment's hesitation, left the room and the house. He let himself\nout, shutting the front door behind him, and as he stood on the pavement\nold Baron Jacobi, who had special reasons for wishing to know how Mrs.\nLee had recovered from the fatigue and excitements of the ball, came up\nto the spot.\n\nA single glance at Ratcliffe showed him that something had gone wrong in\nthe career of that great man, whose fortunes he always followed with so\nbitter a sneer of contempt. Impelled by the spirit of evil always at his\nelbow, the Baron seized this moment to sound the depth of his friend's\nwound. They met at the door so closely that recognition was inevitable,\nand Jacobi, with his worst smile, held out his hand, saying at the same\nmoment with diabolic malignity:\n\n\"I hope I may offer my felicitations to your Excellency!\"\n\nRatcliffe was glad to find some victim on whom he could vent his rage.\nHe had a long score of humiliations to repay this man, whose last insult\nwas beyond all endurance. With an oath he dashed Jacobi's hand aside,\nand, grasping his shoulder, thrust him out of the path. The Baron, among\nwhose weaknesses the want of high temper and personal courage was not\nrecorded, had no mind to tolerate such an insult from such a man. Even\nwhile Ratcliffe's hand was still on his shoulder he had raised his cane,\nand before the Secretary saw what was coming, the old man had struck him\nwith all his force full in the face. For a moment Ratcliffe staggered\nback and grew pale, but the shock sobered him. He hesitated a single\ninstant whether to crush his assailant with a blow, but he felt that\nfor one of his youth and strength, to attack an infirm diplomatist in\na public street would be a fatal blunder, and while Jacobi stood,\nviolently excited, with his cane raised ready to strike another blow,\nMr. Ratcliffe suddenly turned his back and without a word, hastened\naway.\n\nWhen Sybil returned, not long afterwards, she found no one in the\nparlour.\n\nOn going to her sister's room she discovered Madeleine lying on the\ncouch, looking worn and pale, but with a slight smile and a peaceful\nexpression on her face, as though she had done some act which her\nconscience approved. She called Sybil to her side, and, taking her hand,\nsaid:\n\n\"Sybil, dearest, will you go abroad with me again?\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" said Sybil; \"I will go to the end of the world with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I want to go to Egypt,\" said Madeleine, still smiling faintly;\n\"democracy has shaken my nerves to pieces. Oh, what rest it would be to\nlive in the Great Pyramid and look out for ever at the polar star!\"\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nSYBIL TO CARRINGTON \"May 1st, New York.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Carrington,\n\n\"I promised to write you, and so, to keep my\npromise, and also because my sister wishes me to tell you about our\nplans, I send this letter. We have left Washington--for ever, I am\nafraid--and are going to Europe next month.\n\nYou must know that a fortnight ago, Lord Skye gave a great ball to\nthe Grand-Duchess of something-or-other quite unspellable. I never can\ndescribe things, but it was all very fine. I wore a lovely new dress,\nand was a great success, I assure you. So was Madeleine, though she\nhad to sit most of the evening by the Princess--such a dowdy! The Duke\ndanced with me several times; he can't reverse, but that doesn't seem to\nmatter in a Grand-Duke.\n\nWell! things came to a crisis at the end of the evening. I followed your\ndirections, and after we got home gave your letter to Madeleine.\nShe says she has burned it. I don't know what happened afterwards--a\ntremendous scene, I suspect, but Victoria Dare writes me from Washington\nthat every one is talking about M.'s refusal of Mr. R., and a dreadful\nthing that took place on our very doorstep between Mr. R. and Baron\nJacobi, the day after the ball. She says there was a regular pitched\nbattle, and the Baron struck him over the face with his cane. You know\nhow afraid Madeleine was that they would do something of the sort in our\nparlour. I'm glad they waited till they were in the street. But isn't\nit shocking! They say the Baron is to be sent away, or recalled, or\nsomething. I like the old gentleman, and for his sake am glad duelling\nis gone out of fashion, though I don't much believe Mr. Silas P.\nRatcliffe could hit anything. The Baron passed through here three days\nago on his summer trip to Europe. He left his card on us, but we\nwere out, and did not see him. We are going over in July with the\nSchneidekoupons, and Mr. Schneidekoupon has promised to send his yacht\nto the Mediterranean, so that we shall sail about there after finishing\nthe Nile, and see Jerusalem and Gibraltar and Constantinople. I think\nit will be perfectly lovely. I hate ruins, but I fancy you can buy\ndelicious things in Constantinople. Of course, after what has happened,\nwe can never go back to Washington. I shall miss our rides dreadfully.\nI read Mr. Browning's 'Last Ride Together,' as you told me; I think it's\nbeautiful and perfectly easy, all but a little. I never could understand\na word of him before--so I never tried. Who do you think is engaged?\nVictoria Dare, to a coronet and a peat-bog, with Lord Dunbeg attached.\nVictoria says she is happier than she ever was before in any of her\nother engagements, and she is sure this is the real one. She says she\nhas thirty thousand a year derived from the poor of America, which may\njust as well go to relieve one of the poor in Ireland.\n\nYou know her father was a claim agent, or some such thing, and is said\nto have made his money by cheating his clients out of their claims.\nShe is perfectly wild to be a countess, and means to make Castle Dunbeg\nlovely by-and-by, and entertain us all there. Madeleine says she is just\nthe kind to be a great success in London. Madeleine is very well, and\nsends her kind regards. I believe she is going to add a postscript.\nI have promised to let her read this, but I don't think a chaperoned\nletter is much fun to write or receive.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":447,"split":"train"}
