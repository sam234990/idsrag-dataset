Edward has an artistic and literary personality, unsuited to his social position as the son of a successful lawyer who takes over his father's practice in the provincial town of Hamley. His legal representation of the local gentry and nobility leads him to try fitting into their social circles, only to be mocked and treated with derision. He develops a drinking problem and spends more money than he can afford to in his attempts to be an equal to his clients. His bad habits lead to problems in his business, and Edward is forced to take on a junior partner named Mr. Dunster.\nAt the same time, Ellinor becomes engaged to a young upcoming country gentleman named Ralph Corbet. Corbet initiates the engagement partly through love of Ellinor and partly because of a promise of money from Edward. Edward continues to drink and overspend, leading to a confrontation with Mr. Dunster. In the heat of the argument, Edward strikes Mr. Dunster, killing him. Ellinor and a family servant named Dixon help Edward to bury the body in their flower garden.\nEllinor soon tells Ralph that a possible disgrace hangs over her. Ralph questions Edward about this, and Edward insults him in a drunken tirade. Ralph dissolves his engagement to Ellinor because of this, and because he regrets forming an engagement to someone who offers no opportunity of helping him advance in society. He later marries into the nobility and becomes a judge. Edward drinks himself to death and Ellinor moves to a distant town, East Chester, after the Wilkins's home Ford Bank is rented out in order to provide Ellinor with a living. Dixon remains as a servant to watch over the home and property where the body is buried. The secret goes unknown for about 15 years until the body is dug up during the construction of a railroad. Dixon is arrested for the murder and later convicted by Ralph, who acts as the judge in the case. Ellinor then tells Ralph the truth, and Dixon is pardoned. She returns to East Chester and marries a local clergyman, Canon Livingstone, who she had known in her youth, and has two children with him.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, A Dark Night's Work, by Elizabeth Gaskell\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

His grandfather had established the connection; his father\nhad consolidated and strengthened it, and, indeed, by his wise and\nupright conduct, as well as by his professional skill, had obtained for\nhimself the position of confidential friend to many of the surrounding\nfamilies of distinction.  He visited among them in a way which no mere\nlawyer had ever done before; dined at their tables--he alone, not\naccompanied by his wife, be it observed; rode to the meet occasionally as\nif by accident, although he was as well mounted as any squire among them,\nand was often persuaded (after a little coquetting about \"professional\nengagements,\" and \"being wanted at the office\") to have a run with his\nclients; nay, once or twice he forgot his usual caution, was first in at\nthe death, and rode home with the brush.  But in general he knew his\nplace; as his place was held to be in that aristocratic county, and in\nthose days.  Nor let be supposed that he was in any way a toadeater.  He\nrespected himself too much for that.  He would give the most unpalatable\nadvice, if need were; would counsel an unsparing reduction of expenditure\nto an extravagant man; would recommend such an abatement of family pride\nas paved the way for one or two happy marriages in some instances; nay,\nwhat was the most likely piece of conduct of all to give offence forty\nyears ago, he would speak up for an unjustly-used tenant; and that with\nso much temperate and well-timed wisdom and good feeling, that he more\nthan once gained his point.  He had one son, Edward.  This boy was the\nsecret joy and pride of his father's heart.  For himself he was not in\nthe least ambitious, but it did cost him a hard struggle to acknowledge\nthat his own business was too lucrative, and brought in too large an\nincome, to pass away into the hands of a stranger, as it would do if he\nindulged his ambition for his son by giving him a college education and\nmaking him into a barrister.  This determination on the more prudent side\nof the argument took place while Edward was at Eton.  The lad had,\nperhaps, the largest allowance of pocket-money of any boy at school; and\nhe had always looked forward to going to Christ Church along with his\nfellows, the sons of the squires, his father's employers.  It was a\nsevere mortification to him to find that his destiny was changed, and\nthat he had to return to Hamley to be articled to his father, and to\nassume the hereditary subservient position to lads whom he had licked in\nthe play-ground, and beaten at learning.\n\nHis father tried to compensate him for the disappointment by every\nindulgence which money could purchase.  Edward's horses were even finer\nthan those of his father; his literary tastes were kept up and fostered,\nby his father's permission to form an extensive library, for which\npurpose a noble room was added to Mr. Wilkins's already extensive house\nin the suburbs of Hamley.  And after his year of legal study in London\nhis father sent him to make the grand tour, with something very like\ncarte blanche as to expenditure, to judge from the packages which were\nsent home from various parts of the Continent.\n\nAt last he came home--came back to settle as his father's partner at\nHamley.  He was a son to be proud of, and right down proud was old Mr.\nWilkins of his handsome, accomplished, gentlemanly lad.  For Edward was\nnot one to be spoilt by the course of indulgence he had passed through;\nat least, if it had done him an injury, the effects were at present\nhidden from view.  He had no vulgar vices; he was, indeed, rather too\nrefined for the society he was likely to be thrown into, even supposing\nthat society to consist of the highest of his father's employers.  He was\nwell read, and an artist of no mean pretensions.  Above all, \"his heart\nwas in the right place,\" as his father used to observe.  Nothing could\nexceed the deference he always showed to him.  His mother had long been\ndead.\n\nI do not know whether it was Edward's own ambition or his proud father's\nwishes that had led him to attend the Hamley assemblies.  I should\nconjecture the latter, for Edward had of himself too much good taste to\nwish to intrude into any society.  In the opinion of all the shire, no\nsociety had more reason to consider itself select than that which met at\nevery full moon in the Hamley assembly-room, an excrescence built on to\nthe principal inn in the town by the joint subscription of all the county\nfamilies.  Into those choice and mysterious precincts no towns person was\never allowed to enter; no professional man might set his foot therein; no\ninfantry officer saw the interior of that ball, or that card-room.  The\nold original subscribers would fain have had a man prove his sixteen\nquarterings before he might make his bow to the queen of the night; but\nthe old original founders of the Hamley assemblies were dropping off;\nminuets had vanished with them, country dances had died away; quadrilles\nwere in high vogue--nay, one or two of the high magnates of ---shire were\ntrying to introduce waltzing, as they had seen it in London, where it had\ncome in with the visit of the allied sovereigns, when Edward Wilkins made\nhis _debut_ on these boards.  He had been at many splendid assemblies\nabroad, but still the little old ballroom attached to the George Inn in\nhis native town was to him a place grander and more awful than the most\nmagnificent saloons he had seen in Paris or Rome.  He laughed at himself\nfor this unreasonable feeling of awe; but there it was notwithstanding.\nHe had been dining at the house of one of the lesser gentry, who was\nunder considerable obligations to his father, and who was the parent of\neight \"muckle-mou'ed\" daughters, so hardly likely to oppose much\naristocratic resistance to the elder Mr. Wilkins's clearly implied wish\nthat Edward should be presented at the Hamley assembly-rooms.  But many a\nsquire glowered and looked black at the introduction of Wilkins the\nattorney's son into the sacred precincts; and perhaps there would have\nbeen much more mortification than pleasure in this assembly to the young\nman, had it not been for an incident that occurred pretty late in the\nevening.  The lord-lieutenant of the county usually came with a large\nparty to the Hamley assemblies once in a season; and this night he was\nexpected, and with him a fashionable duchess and her daughters.  But time\nwore on, and they did not make their appearance.  At last there was a\nrustling and a bustling, and in sailed the superb party.  For a few\nminutes dancing was stopped; the earl led the duchess to a sofa; some of\ntheir acquaintances came up to speak to them; and then the quadrilles\nwere finished in rather a flat manner.  A country dance followed, in\nwhich none of the lord-lieutenant's party joined; then there was a\nconsultation, a request, an inspection of the dancers, a message to the\norchestra, and the band struck up a waltz; the duchess's daughters flew\noff to the music, and some more young ladies seemed ready to follow, but,\nalas! there was a lack of gentlemen acquainted with the new-fashioned\ndance.  One of the stewards bethought him of young Wilkins, only just\nreturned from the Continent.  Edward was a beautiful dancer, and waltzed\nto admiration.  For his next partner he had one of the Lady ---s; for the\nduchess, to whom the--shire squires and their little county politics and\ncontempts were alike unknown, saw no reason why her lovely Lady Sophy\nshould not have a good partner, whatever his pedigree might be, and\nbegged the stewards to introduce Mr. Wilkins to her.  After this night\nhis fortune was made with the young ladies of the Hamley assemblies.  He\nwas not unpopular with the mammas; but the heavy squires still looked at\nhim askance, and the heirs (whom he had licked at Eton) called him an\nupstart behind his back.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nIt was not a satisfactory situation.  Mr. Wilkins had given his son an\neducation and tastes beyond his position.  He could not associate with\neither profit or pleasure with the doctor or the brewer of Hamley; the\nvicar was old and deaf, the curate a raw young man, half frightened at\nthe sound of his own voice.  Then, as to matrimony--for the idea of his\nmarriage was hardly more present in Edward's mind than in that of his\nfather--he could scarcely fancy bringing home any one of the young ladies\nof Hamley to the elegant mansion, so full of suggestion and association\nto an educated person, so inappropriate a dwelling for an ignorant,\nuncouth, ill-brought-up girl.  Yet Edward was fully aware, if his fond\nfather was not, that of all the young ladies who were glad enough of him\nas a partner at the Hamley assemblies, there was not of them but would\nhave considered herself affronted by an offer of marriage from an\nattorney, the son and grandson of attorneys.  The young man had perhaps\nreceived many a slight and mortification pretty quietly during these\nyears, which yet told upon his character in after life.  Even at this\nvery time they were having their effect.  He was of too sweet a\ndisposition to show resentment, as many men would have done.  But\nnevertheless he took a secret pleasure in the power which his father's\nmoney gave him.  He would buy an expensive horse after five minutes'\nconversation as to the price, about which a needy heir of one of the\nproud county families had been haggling for three weeks.  His dogs were\nfrom the best kennels in England, no matter at what cost; his guns were\nthe newest and most improved make; and all these were expenses on objects\nwhich were among those of daily envy to the squires and squires' sons\naround.  They did not much care for the treasures of art, which report\nsaid were being accumulated in Mr. Wilkins's house.  But they did covet\nthe horses and hounds he possessed, and the young man knew that they\ncoveted, and rejoiced in it.\n\nBy-and-by he formed a marriage, which went as near as marriages ever do\ntowards pleasing everybody.  He was desperately in love with Miss\nLamotte, so he was delighted when she consented to be his wife.  His\nfather was delighted in his delight, and, besides, was charmed to\nremember that Miss Lamotte's mother had been Sir Frank Holster's younger\nsister, and that, although her marriage had been disowned by her family,\nas beneath her in rank, yet no one could efface her name out of the\nBaronetage, where Lettice, youngest daughter of Sir Mark Holster, born\n1772, married H. Lamotte, 1799, died 1810, was duly chronicled.  She had\nleft two children, a boy and a girl, of whom their uncle, Sir Frank, took\ncharge, as their father was worse than dead--an outlaw whose name was\nnever mentioned.  Mark Lamotte was in the army; Lettice had a dependent\nposition in her uncle's family; not intentionally made more dependent\nthan was rendered necessary by circumstances, but still dependent enough\nto grate on the feelings of a sensitive girl, whose natural susceptibilty\nto slights was redoubled by the constant recollection of her father's\ndisgrace.  As Mr. Wilkins well knew, Sir Frank was considerably involved;\nbut it was with very mixed feelings that he listened to the suit which\nwould provide his penniless niece with a comfortable, not to say\nluxurious, home, and with a handsome, accomplished young man of\nunblemished character for a husband.  He said one or two bitter and\ninsolent things to Mr. Wilkins, even while he was giving his consent to\nthe match; that was his temper, his proud, evil temper; but he really and\npermanently was satisfied with the connection, though he would\noccasionally turn round on his nephew-in-law, and sting him with a covert\ninsult, as to his want of birth, and the inferior position which he held,\nforgetting, apparently, that his own brother-in-law and Lettice's father\nmight be at any moment brought to the bar of justice if he attempted to\nre-enter his native country.\n\nEdward was annoyed at all this; Lettice resented it.  She loved her\nhusband dearly, and was proud of him, for she had discernment enough to\nsee how superior he was in every way to her cousins, the young Holsters,\nwho borrowed his horses, drank his wines, and yet had caught their\nfather's habit of sneering at his profession.  Lettice wished that Edward\nwould content himself with a purely domestic life, would let himself drop\nout of the company of the ---shire squirearchy, and find his relaxation\nwith her, in their luxurious library, or lovely drawing-room, so full of\nwhite gleaming statues, and gems of pictures.  But, perhaps, this was too\nmuch to expect of any man, especially of one who felt himself fitted in\nmany ways to shine in society, and who was social by nature.  Sociality\nin that county at that time meant conviviality.  Edward did not care for\nwine, and yet he was obliged to drink--and by-and-by he grew to pique\nhimself on his character as a judge of wine.  His father by this time was\ndead; dead, happy old man, with a contented heart--his affairs\nflourishing, his poorer neighbours loving him, his richer respecting him,\nhis son and daughter-in-law, the most affectionate and devoted that ever\nman had, and his healthy conscience at peace with his God.\n\nLettice could have lived to herself and her husband and children.  Edward\ndaily required more and more the stimulus of society.  His wife wondered\nhow he could care to accept dinner invitations from people who treated\nhim as \"Wilkins the attorney, a very good sort of fellow,\" as they\nintroduced him to strangers who might be staying in the country, but who\nhad no power to appreciate the taste, the talents, the impulsive artistic\nnature which she held so dear.  She forgot that by accepting such\ninvitations Edward was occasionally brought into contact with people not\nmerely of high conventional, but of high intellectual rank; that when a\ncertain amount of wine had dissipated his sense of inferiority of rank\nand position, he was a brilliant talker, a man to be listened to and\nadmired even by wandering London statesmen, professional diners-out, or\nany great authors who might find themselves visitors in a ---shire\ncountry-house.  What she would have had him share from the pride of her\nheart, she should have warned him to avoid from the temptations to sinful\nextravagance which it led him into.  He had begun to spend more than he\nought, not in intellectual--though that would have been wrong--but in\npurely sensual things.  His wines, his table, should be such as no\nsquire's purse or palate could command.  His dinner-parties--small in\nnumber, the viands rare and delicate in quality, and sent up to table by\nan Italian cook--should be such as even the London stars should notice\nwith admiration.  He would have Lettice dressed in the richest materials,\nthe most delicate lace; jewellery, he said, was beyond their means;\nglancing with proud humility at the diamonds of the elder ladies, and the\nalloyed gold of the younger.  But he managed to spend as much on his\nwife's lace as would have bought many a set of inferior jewellery.\nLettice well became it all.  If as people said, her father had been\nnothing but a French adventurer, she bore traces of her nature in her\ngrace, her delicacy, her fascinating and elegant ways of doing all\nthings.  She was made for society; and yet she hated it.  And one day she\nwent out of it altogether and for evermore.  She had been well in the\nmorning when Edward went down to his office in Hamley.  At noon he was\nsent for by hurried trembling messengers.  When he got home breathless\nand uncomprehending, she was past speech.  One glance from her lovely\nloving black eyes showed that she recognised him with the passionate\nyearning that had been one of the characteristics of her love through\nlife.  There was no word passed between them.  He could not speak, any\nmore than could she.  He knelt down by her.  She was dying; she was dead;\nand he knelt on immovable.  They brought him his eldest child, Ellinor,\nin utter despair what to do in order to rouse him.  They had no thought\nas to the effect on her, hitherto shut up in the nursery during this busy\nday of confusion and alarm.  The child had no idea of death, and her\nfather, kneeling and tearless, was far less an object of surprise or\ninterest to her than her mother, lying still and white, and not turning\nher head to smile at her darling.\n\n\"Mamma! mamma!\" cried the child, in shapeless terror.  But the mother\nnever stirred; and the father hid his face yet deeper in the bedclothes,\nto stifle a cry as if a sharp knife had pierced his heart.  The child\nforced her impetuous way from her attendants, and rushed to the bed.\nUndeterred by deadly cold or stony immobility, she kissed the lips and\nstroked the glossy raven hair, murmuring sweet words of wild love, such\nas had passed between the mother and child often and often when no\nwitnesses were by; and altogether seemed so nearly beside herself in an\nagony of love and terror, that Edward arose, and softly taking her in his\narms, bore her away, lying back like one dead (so exhausted was she by\nthe terrible emotion they had forced on her childish heart), into his\nstudy, a little room opening out of the grand library, where on happy\nevenings, never to come again, he and his wife were wont to retire to\nhave coffee together, and then perhaps stroll out of the glass-door into\nthe open air, the shrubbery, the fields--never more to be trodden by\nthose dear feet.  What passed between father and child in this seclusion\nnone could tell.  Late in the evening Ellinor's supper was sent for, and\nthe servant who brought it in saw the child lying as one dead in her\nfather's arms, and before he left the room watched his master feeding\nher, the girl of six years of age, with as tender care as if she had been\na baby of six months.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nFrom that time the tie between father and daughter grew very strong and\ntender indeed.  Ellinor, it is true, divided her affection between her\nbaby sister and her papa; but he, caring little for babies, had only a\ntheoretic regard for his younger child, while the elder absorbed all his\nlove.  Every day that he dined at home Ellinor was placed opposite to him\nwhile he ate his late dinner; she sat where her mother had done during\nthe meal, although she had dined and even supped some time before on the\nmore primitive nursery fare.  It was half pitiful, half amusing, to see\nthe little girl's grave, thoughtful ways and modes of speech, as if\ntrying to act up to the dignity of her place as her father's companion,\ntill sometimes the little head nodded off to slumber in the middle of\nlisping some wise little speech.  \"Old-fashioned,\" the nurses called her,\nand prophesied that she would not live long in consequence of her old-\nfashionedness.  But instead of the fulfilment of this prophecy, the fat\nbright baby was seized with fits, and was well, ill, and dead in a day!\nEllinor's grief was something alarming, from its quietness and\nconcealment.  She waited till she was left--as she thought--alone at\nnights, and then sobbed and cried her passionate cry for \"Baby, baby,\ncome back to me--come back;\" till every one feared for the health of the\nfrail little girl whose childish affections had had to stand two such\nshocks.  Her father put aside all business, all pleasure of every kind,\nto win his darling from her grief.  No mother could have done more, no\ntenderest nurse done half so much as Mr. Wilkins then did for Ellinor.\n\nIf it had not been for him she would have just died of her grief.  As it\nwas, she overcame it--but slowly, wearily--hardly letting herself love\nanyone for some time, as if she instinctively feared lest all her strong\nattachments should find a sudden end in death.  Her love--thus dammed up\ninto a small space--at last burst its banks, and overflowed on her\nfather.  It was a rich reward to him for all his care of her, and he took\ndelight--perhaps a selfish delight--in all the many pretty ways she\nperpetually found of convincing him, if he had needed conviction, that he\nwas ever the first object with her.  The nurse told him that half an hour\nor so before the earliest time at which he could be expected home in the\nevenings, Miss Ellinor began to fold up her doll's things and lull the\ninanimate treasure to sleep.  Then she would sit and listen with an\nintensity of attention for his footstep.  Once the nurse had expressed\nsome wonder at the distance at which Ellinor could hear her father's\napproach, saying that she had listened and could not hear a sound, to\nwhich Ellinor had replied:\n\n\"Of course you cannot; he is not your papa!\"\n\nThen, when he went away in the morning, after he had kissed her, Ellinor\nwould run to a certain window from which she could watch him up the lane,\nnow hidden behind a hedge, now reappearing through an open space, again\nout of sight, till he reached a great old beech-tree, where for an\ninstant more she saw him.  And then she would turn away with a sigh,\nsometimes reassuring her unspoken fears by saying softly to herself,\n\n\"He will come again to-night.\"\n\nMr. Wilkins liked to feel his child dependent on him for all her\npleasures.  He was even a little jealous of anyone who devised a treat or\nconferred a present, the first news of which did not come from or through\nhim.\n\nAt last it was necessary that Ellinor should have some more instruction\nthan her good old nurse could give.  Her father did not care to take upon\nhimself the office of teacher, which he thought he foresaw would\nnecessitate occasional blame, an occasional exercise of authority, which\nmight possibly render him less idolized by his little girl; so he\ncommissioned Lady Holster to choose out one among her many _protegees_\nfor a governess to his daughter.  Now, Lady Holster, who kept a sort of\namateur county register-office, was only too glad to be made of use in\nthis way; but when she inquired a little further as to the sort of person\nrequired, all she could extract from Mr. Wilkins was:\n\n\"You know the kind of education a lady should have, and will, I am sure,\nchoose a governess for Ellinor better than I could direct you.  Only,\nplease, choose some one who will not marry me, and who will let Ellinor\ngo on making my tea, and doing pretty much what she likes, for she is so\ngood they need not try to make her better, only to teach her what a lady\nshould know.\"\n\nMiss Monro was selected--a plain, intelligent, quiet woman of forty--and\nit was difficult to decide whether she or Mr. Wilkins took the most pains\nto avoid each other, acting with regard to Ellinor, pretty much like the\nfamous Adam and Eve in the weather-glass: when the one came out the other\nwent in.  Miss Monro had been tossed about and overworked quite enough in\nher life not to value the privilege and indulgence of her evenings to\nherself, her comfortable schoolroom, her quiet cozy teas, her book, or\nher letter-writing afterwards.  By mutual agreement she did not interfere\nwith Ellinor and her ways and occupations on the evenings when the girl\nhad not her father for companion; and these occasions became more and\nmore frequent as years passed on, and the deep shadow was lightened which\nthe sudden death that had visited his household had cast over him.  As I\nhave said before, he was always a popular man at dinner-parties.  His\namount of intelligence and accomplishment was rare in ---shire, and if it\nrequired more wine than formerly to bring his conversation up to the\ndesired point of range and brilliancy, wine was not an article spared or\ngrudged at the county dinner-tables.  Occasionally his business took him\nup to London.  Hurried as these journeys might be, he never returned\nwithout a new game, a new toy of some kind, to \"make home pleasant to his\nlittle maid,\" as he expressed himself.\n\nHe liked, too, to see what was doing in art, or in literature; and as he\ngave pretty extensive orders for anything he admired, he was almost sure\nto be followed down to Hamley by one or two packages or parcels, the\narrival and opening of which began soon to form the pleasant epochs in\nEllinor's grave though happy life.\n\nThe only person of his own standing with whom Mr. Wilkins kept up any\nintercourse in Hamley was the new clergyman, a bachelor, about his own\nage, a learned man, a fellow of his college, whose first claim on Mr.\nWilkins's attention was the fact that he had been travelling-bachelor for\nhis university, and had consequently been on the Continent about the very\nsame two years that Mr. Wilkins had been there; and although they had\nnever met, yet they had many common acquaintances and common\nrecollections to talk over of this period, which, after all, had been\nabout the most bright and hopeful of Mr. Wilkins's life.\n\nMr. Ness had an occasional pupil; that is to say, he never put himself\nout of the way to obtain pupils, but did not refuse the entreaties\nsometimes made to him that he would prepare a young man for college, by\nallowing the said young man to reside and read with him.  \"Ness's men\"\ntook rather high honours, for the tutor, too indolent to find out work\nfor himself, had a certain pride in doing well the work that was found\nfor him.\n\nWhen Ellinor was somewhere about fourteen, a young Mr. Corbet came to be\npupil to Mr. Ness.  Her father always called on the young men reading\nwith the clergyman, and asked them to his house.  His hospitality had in\ncourse of time lost its _recherche_ and elegant character, but was always\ngenerous, and often profuse.  Besides, it was in his character to like\nthe joyous, thoughtless company of the young better than that of the\nold--given the same amount of refinement and education in both.\n\nMr. Corbet was a young man of very good family, from a distant county.  If\nhis character had not been so grave and deliberate, his years would only\nhave entitled him to be called a boy, for he was but eighteen at the time\nwhen he came to read with Mr. Ness.  But many men of five-and-twenty have\nnot reflected so deeply as this young Mr. Corbet already had.  He had\nconsidered and almost matured his plan for life; had ascertained what\nobjects he desired most to accomplish in the dim future, which is to many\nat his age only a shapeless mist; and had resolved on certain steady\ncourses of action by which such objects were most likely to be secured.  A\nyounger son, his family connections and family interest pre-arranged a\nlegal career for him; and it was in accordance with his own tastes and\ntalents.  All, however, which his father hoped for him was, that he might\nbe able to make an income sufficient for a gentleman to live on.  Old Mr.\nCorbet was hardly to be called ambitious, or, if he were, his ambition\nwas limited to views for the eldest son.  But Ralph intended to be a\ndistinguished lawyer, not so much for the vision of the woolsack, which I\nsuppose dances before the imagination of every young lawyer, as for the\ngrand intellectual exercise, and consequent power over mankind, that\ndistinguished lawyers may always possess if they choose.  A seat in\nParliament, statesmanship, and all the great scope for a powerful and\nactive mind that lay on each side of such a career--these were the\nobjects which Ralph Corbet set before himself.  To take high honours at\ncollege was the first step to be accomplished; and in order to achieve\nthis Ralph had, not persuaded--persuasion was a weak instrument which he\ndespised--but gravely reasoned his father into consenting to pay the\nlarge sum which Mr. Ness expected with a pupil.  The good-natured old\nsquire was rather pressed for ready money, but sooner than listen to an\nargument instead of taking his nap after dinner he would have yielded\nanything.  But this did not satisfy Ralph; his father's reason must be\nconvinced of the desirability of the step, as well as his weak will give\nway.  The squire listened, looked wise, sighed; spoke of Edward's\nextravagance and the girls' expenses, grew sleepy, and said, \"Very true,\"\n\"That is but reasonable, certainly,\" glanced at the door, and wondered\nwhen his son would have ended his talking and go into the drawing-room;\nand at length found himself writing the desired letter to Mr. Ness,\nconsenting to everything, terms and all.  Mr. Ness never had a more\nsatisfactory pupil; one whom he could treat more as an intellectual\nequal.\n\nMr. Corbet, as Ralph was always called in Hamley, was resolute in his\ncultivation of himself, even exceeding what his tutor demanded of him.  He\nwas greedy of information in the hours not devoted to absolute study.  Mr.\nNess enjoyed giving information, but most of all he liked the hard tough\narguments on all metaphysical and ethical questions in which Mr. Corbet\ndelighted to engage him.  They lived together on terms of happy equality,\nhaving thus much in common.  They were essentially different, however,\nalthough there were so many points of resemblance.  Mr. Ness was\nunworldly as far as the idea of real unworldliness is compatible with a\nturn for self-indulgence and indolence; while Mr. Corbet was deeply,\nradically worldly, yet for the accomplishment of his object could deny\nhimself all the careless pleasures natural to his age.  The tutor and\npupil allowed themselves one frequent relaxation, that of Mr. Wilkins's\ncompany.  Mr. Ness would stroll to the office after the six hours' hard\nreading were over--leaving Mr. Corbet still bent over the table, book\nbestrewn--and see what Mr. Wilkins's engagements were.  If he had nothing\nbetter to do that evening, he was either asked to dine at the parsonage,\nor he, in his careless hospitable way, invited the other two to dine with\nhim, Ellinor forming the fourth at table, as far as seats went, although\nher dinner had been eaten early with Miss Monro.  She was little and\nslight of her age, and her father never seemed to understand how she was\npassing out of childhood.  Yet while in stature she was like a child; in\nintellect, in force of character, in strength of clinging affection, she\nwas a woman.  There might be much of the simplicity of a child about her,\nthere was little of the undeveloped girl, varying from day to day like an\nApril sky, careless as to which way her own character is tending.  So the\ntwo young people sat with their elders, and both relished the company\nthey were thus prematurely thrown into.  Mr. Corbet talked as much as\neither of the other two gentlemen; opposing and disputing on any side, as\nif to find out how much he could urge against received opinions.  Ellinor\nsat silent; her dark eyes flashing from time to time in vehement\ninterest--sometimes in vehement indignation if Mr. Corbet, riding a-tilt\nat everyone, ventured to attack her father.  He saw how this course\nexcited her, and rather liked pursuing it in consequence; he thought it\nonly amused him.\n\nAnother way in which Ellinor and Mr. Corbet were thrown together\noccasionally was this: Mr. Ness and Mr. Wilkins shared the same _Times_\nbetween them; and it was Ellinor's duty to see that the paper was\nregularly taken from her father's house to the parsonage.  Her father\nliked to dawdle over it.  Until Mr. Corbet had come to live with him, Mr.\nNess had not much cared at what time it was passed on to him; but the\nyoung man took a strong interest in all public events, and especially in\nall that was said about them.  He grew impatient if the paper was not\nforthcoming, and would set off himself to go for it, sometimes meeting\nthe penitent breathless Ellinor in the long lane which led from Hamley to\nMr. Wilkins's house.  At first he used to receive her eager \"Oh! I am so\nsorry, Mr. Corbet, but papa has only just done with it,\" rather gruffly.\nAfter a time he had the grace to tell her it did not signify; and by-and-\nby he would turn back with her to give her some advice about her garden,\nor her plants--for his mother and sisters were first-rate practical\ngardeners, and he himself was, as he expressed it, \"a capital consulting\nphysician for a sickly plant.\"\n\nAll this time his voice, his step, never raised the child's colour one\nshade the higher, never made her heart beat the least quicker, as the\nslightest sign of her father's approach was wont to do.  She learnt to\nrely on Mr. Corbet for advice, for a little occasional sympathy, and for\nmuch condescending attention.  He also gave her more fault-finding than\nall the rest of the world put together; and, curiously enough, she was\ngrateful to him for it, for she really was humble and wished to improve.\nHe liked the attitude of superiority which this implied and exercised\nright gave him.  They were very good friends at present.  Nothing more.\n\nAll this time I have spoken only of Mr. Wilkins's life as he stood in\nrelation to his daughter.  But there is far more to be said about it.\nAfter his wife's death, he withdrew himself from society for a year or\ntwo in a more positive and decided manner than is common with widowers.\nIt was during this retirement of his that he riveted his little\ndaughter's heart in such a way as to influence all her future life.\n\nWhen he began to go out again, it might have been perceived--had any one\ncared to notice--how much the different characters of his father and wife\nhad influenced him and kept him steady.  Not that he broke out into any\nimmoral conduct, but he gave up time to pleasure, which both old Mr.\nWilkins and Lettice would have quietly induced him to spend in the\noffice, superintending his business.  His indulgence in hunting, and all\nfield sports, had hitherto been only occasional; they now became\nhabitual, as far as the seasons permitted.  He shared a moor in Scotland\nwith one of the Holsters one year, persuading himself that the bracing\nair was good for Ellinor's health.  But the year afterwards he took\nanother, this time joining with a comparative stranger; and on this moor\nthere was no house to which it was fit to bring a child and her\nattendants.  He persuaded himself that by frequent journeys he could make\nup for his absences from Hamley.  But journeys cost money; and he was\noften away from his office when important business required attending to.\nThere was some talk of a new attorney setting up in Hamley, to be\nsupported by one or two of the more influential county families, who had\nfound Wilkins not so attentive as his father.  Sir Frank Holster sent for\nhis relation, and told him of this project, speaking to him, at the same\ntime, in pretty round terms on the folly of the life he was leading.\nFoolish it certainly was, and as such Mr. Wilkins was secretly\nacknowledging it; but when Sir Frank, lashing himself, began to talk of\nhis hearer's presumption in joining the hunt, in aping the mode of life\nand amusements of the landed gentry, Edward fired up.  He knew how much\nSir Frank was dipped, and comparing it with the round sum his own father\nhad left him, he said some plain truths to Sir Frank which the latter\nnever forgave, and henceforth there was no intercourse between Holster\nCourt and Ford Bank, as Mr. Edward Wilkins had christened his father's\nhouse on his first return from the Continent.\n\nThe conversation had two consequences besides the immediate one of the\nquarrel.  Mr. Wilkins advertised for a responsible and confidential clerk\nto conduct the business under his own superintendence; and he also wrote\nto the Heralds' College to ask if he did not belong to the family bearing\nthe same name in South Wales--those who have since reassumed their\nancient name of De Winton.\n\nBoth applications were favorably answered.  A skilful, experienced,\nmiddle-aged clerk was recommended to him by one of the principal legal\nfirms in London, and immediately engaged to come to Hamley at his own\nterms; which were pretty high.  But, as Mr. Wilkins said it was worth any\nmoney to pay for the relief from constant responsibility which such a\nbusiness as his involved, some people remarked that he had never appeared\nto feel the responsibility very much hitherto, as witness his absences in\nScotland, and his various social engagements when at home; it had been\nvery different (they said) in his father's day.  The Heralds' College\nheld out hopes of affiliating him to the South Wales family, but it would\nrequire time and money to make the requisite inquiries and substantiate\nthe claim.  Now, in many a place there would be none to contest the right\na man might have to assert that he belonged to such and such a family, or\neven to assume their arms.  But it was otherwise in ---shire.  Everyone\nwas up in genealogy and heraldry, and considered filching a name and a\npedigree a far worse sin than any of those mentioned on the Commandments.\nThere were those among them who would doubt and dispute even the decision\nof the Heralds' College; but with it, if in his favour, Mr. Wilkins\nintended to be satisfied, and accordingly he wrote in reply to their\nletter to say, that of course he was aware such inquiries would take a\nconsiderable sum of money, but still he wished them to be made, and that\nspeedily.\n\nBefore the end of the year he went up to London to order a brougham to be\nbuilt (for Ellinor to drive out in wet weather, he said; but as going in\na closed carriage always made her ill, he used it principally himself in\ndriving to dinner-parties), with the De Winton Wilkinses' arms neatly\nemblazoned on panel and harness.  Hitherto he had always gone about in a\ndog-cart--the immediate descendant of his father's old-fashioned gig.\n\nFor all this, the squires, his employers, only laughed at him and did not\ntreat him with one whit more respect.\n\nMr. Dunster, the new clerk, was a quiet, respectable-looking man; you\ncould not call him a gentleman in manner, and yet no one could say he was\nvulgar.  He had not much varying expression on his face, but a permanent\none of thoughtful consideration of the subject in hand, whatever it might\nbe, that would have fitted as well with the profession of medicine as\nwith that of law, and was quite the right look for either.  Occasionally\na bright flash of sudden intelligence lightened up his deep-sunk eyes,\nbut even this was quickly extinguished as by some inward repression, and\nthe habitually reflective, subdued expression returned to the face.  As\nsoon as he came into his situation, he first began quietly to arrange the\npapers, and next the business of which they were the outer sign, into\nmore methodical order than they had been in since old Mr. Wilkins's\ndeath.  Punctual to a moment himself, he looked his displeased surprise\nwhen the inferior clerks came tumbling in half an hour after the time in\nthe morning; and his look was more effective than many men's words;\nhenceforward the subordinates were within five minutes of the appointed\nhour for opening the office; but still he was always there before them.\nMr. Wilkins himself winced under his new clerk's order and punctuality;\nMr. Dunster's raised eyebrow and contraction of the lips at some woeful\nconfusion in the business of the office, chafed Mr. Wilkins more, far\nmore than any open expression of opinion would have done; for that he\ncould have met, and explained away as he fancied.  A secret respectful\ndislike grew up in his bosom against Mr. Dunster.  He esteemed him, he\nvalued him, and he could not bear him.  Year after year Mr. Wilkins had\nbecome more under the influence of his feelings, and less under the\ncommand of his reason.  He rather cherished than repressed his nervous\nrepugnance to the harsh measured tones of Mr. Dunster's voice; the latter\nspoke with a provincial twang which grated on his employer's sensitive\near.  He was annoyed at a certain green coat which his new clerk brought\nwith him, and he watched its increasing shabbiness with a sort of\nchildish pleasure.  But by-and-by Mr. Wilkins found out that, from some\nperversity of taste, Mr. Dunster always had his coats, Sunday and working-\nday, made of this obnoxious colour; and this knowledge did not diminish\nhis secret irritation.  The worst of all, perhaps, was, that Mr. Dunster\nwas really invaluable in many ways; \"a perfect treasure,\" as Mr. Wilkins\nused to term him in speaking of him after dinner; but, for all that, he\ncame to hate his \"perfect treasure,\" as he gradually felt that Dunster\nhad become so indispensable to the business that his chief could not do\nwithout him.\n\nThe clients re-echoed Mr. Wilkins's words, and spoke of Mr. Dunster as\ninvaluable to his master; a thorough treasure, the very saving of the\nbusiness.  They had not been better attended to, not even in old Mr.\nWilkins's days; such a clear head, such a knowledge of law, such a\nsteady, upright fellow, always at his post.  The grating voice, the\ndrawling accent, the bottle-green coat, were nothing to them; far less\nnoticed, in fact, than Wilkins's expensive habits, the money he paid for\nhis wine and horses, and the nonsense of claiming kin with the Welsh\nWilkinses, and setting up his brougham to drive about ---shire lanes, and\nbe knocked to pieces over the rough round paving-stones thereof.\n\nAll these remarks did not come near Ellinor to trouble her life.  To her,\nher dear father was the first of human beings; so sweet, so good, so\nkind, so charming in conversation, so full of accomplishment and\ninformation!  To her healthy, happy mind every one turned their bright\nside.  She loved Miss Monro--all the servants--especially Dixon, the\ncoachman.  He had been her father's playfellow as a boy, and, with all\nhis respect and admiration for his master, the freedom of intercourse\nthat had been established between them then had never been quite lost.\nDixon was a fine, stalwart old fellow, and was as harmonious in his ways\nwith his master as Mr. Dunster was discordant; accordingly he was a great\nfavourite, and could say many a thing which might have been taken as\nimpertinent from another servant.\n\nHe was Ellinor's great confidant about many of her little plans and\nprojects; things that she dared not speak of to Mr. Corbet, who, after\nher father and Dixon, was her next best friend.  This intimacy with Dixon\ndispleased Mr. Corbet.  He once or twice insinuated that he did not think\nit was well to talk so familiarly as Ellinor did with a servant--one out\nof a completely different class--such as Dixon.  Ellinor did not easily\ntake hints; every one had spoken plain out to her hitherto; so Mr. Corbet\nhad to say his meaning plain out at last.  Then, for the first time, he\nsaw her angry; but she was too young, too childish, to have words at will\nto express her feelings; she only could say broken beginnings of\nsentences, such as \"What a shame!  Good, dear Dixon, who is as loyal and\ntrue and kind as any nobleman.  I like him far better than you, Mr.\nCorbet, and I shall talk to him.\"  And then she burst into tears and ran\naway, and would not come to wish Mr. Corbet good-bye, though she knew she\nshould not see him again for a long time, as he was returning the next\nday to his father's house, from whence he would go to Cambridge.\n\nHe was annoyed at this result of the good advice he had thought himself\nbound to give to a motherless girl, who had no one to instruct her in the\nproprieties in which his own sisters were brought up; he left Hamley both\nsorry and displeased.  As for Ellinor, when she found out the next day\nthat he really was gone--gone without even coming to Ford Bank again to\nsee if she were not penitent for her angry words--gone without saying or\nhearing a word of good-bye--she shut herself up in her room, and cried\nmore bitterly than ever, because anger against herself was mixed with her\nregret for his loss.  Luckily, her father was dining out, or he would\nhave inquired what was the matter with his darling; and she would have\nhad to try to explain what could not be explained.  As it was, she sat\nwith her back to the light during the schoolroom tea, and afterwards,\nwhen Miss Monro had settled down to her study of the Spanish language,\nEllinor stole out into the garden, meaning to have a fresh cry over her\nown naughtiness and Mr. Corbet's departure; but the August evening was\nstill and calm, and put her passionate grief to shame, hushing her up, as\nit were, with the other young creatures, who were being soothed to rest\nby the serene time of day, and the subdued light of the twilight sky.\n\nThere was a piece of ground surrounding the flower-garden, which was not\nshrubbery, nor wood, nor kitchen garden--only a grassy bit, out of which\na group of old forest trees sprang.  Their roots were heaved above\nground; their leaves fell in autumn so profusely that the turf was ragged\nand bare in spring; but, to make up for this, there never was such a\nplace for snowdrops.\n\nThe roots of these old trees were Ellinor's favourite play-place; this\nspace between these two was her doll's kitchen, that its drawing-room,\nand so on.  Mr. Corbet rather despised her contrivances for doll's\nfurniture, so she had not often brought him here; but Dixon delighted in\nthem, and contrived and planned with the eagerness of six years old\nrather than forty.  To-night Ellinor went to this place, and there were\nall a new collection of ornaments for Miss Dolly's sitting-room made out\nof fir-bobs, in the prettiest and most ingenious way.  She knew it was\nDixon's doing and rushed off in search of him to thank him.\n\n\"What's the matter with my pretty?\" asked Dixon, as soon as the pleasant\nexcitement of thanking and being thanked was over, and he had leisure to\nlook at her tear-stained face.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know!  Never mind,\" said she, reddening.\n\nDixon was silent for a minute or two, while she tried to turn off his\nattention by her hurried prattle.\n\n\"There's no trouble afoot that I can mend?\" asked he, in a minute or two.\n\n\"Oh, no!  It's really nothing--nothing at all,\" said she.  \"It's only\nthat Mr. Corbet went away without saying good-bye to me, that's all.\"  And\nshe looked as if she should have liked to cry again.\n\n\"That was not manners,\" said Dixon, decisively.\n\n\"But it was my fault,\" replied Ellinor, pleading against the\ncondemnation.\n\nDixon looked at her pretty sharply from under his ragged bushy eyebrows.\n\n\"He had been giving me a lecture, and saying I didn't do what his sisters\ndid--just as if I were to be always trying to be like somebody else--and\nI was cross and ran away.\"\n\n\"Then it was Missy who wouldn't say good-bye.  That was not manners in\nMissy.\"\n\n\"But, Dixon, I don't like being lectured!\"\n\n\"I reckon you don't get much of it.  But, indeed, my pretty, I daresay\nMr. Corbet was in the right; for, you see, master is busy, and Miss Monro\nis so dreadful learned, and your poor mother is dead and gone, and you\nhave no one to teach you how young ladies go on; and by all accounts Mr.\nCorbet comes of a good family.  I've heard say his father had the best\nstud-farm in all Shropshire, and spared no money upon it; and the young\nladies his sisters will have been taught the best of manners; it might be\nwell for my pretty to hear how they go on.\"\n\n\"You dear old Dixon, you don't know anything about my lecture, and I'm\nnot going to tell you.  Only I daresay Mr. Corbet might be a little bit\nright, though I'm sure he was a great deal wrong.\"\n\n\"But you'll not go on a-fretting--you won't now, there's a good young\nlady--for master won't like it, and it'll make him uneasy, and he's\nenough of trouble without your red eyes, bless them.\"\n\n\"Trouble--papa, trouble!  Oh, Dixon! what do you mean?\" exclaimed\nEllinor, her face taking all a woman's intensity of expression in a\nminute.\n\n\n  \"Nay, I know nought,\" said Dixon, evasively.  \"Only that Dunster fellow\nis not to my mind, and I think he potters the master sadly with his fid-\nfad ways.\"\n\n\"I hate Mr. Dunster!\" said Ellinor, vehemently.  \"I won't speak a word to\nhim the next time he comes to dine with papa.\"\n\n\"Missy will do what papa likes best,\" said Dixon, admonishingly; and with\nthis the pair of \"friends\" parted,\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe summer afterwards Mr. Corbet came again to read with Mr. Ness.  He\ndid not perceive any alteration in himself, and indeed his early-matured\ncharacter had hardly made progress during the last twelve months whatever\nintellectual acquirements he might have made.  Therefore it was\nastonishing to him to see the alteration in Ellinor Wilkins.  She had\nshot up from a rather puny girl to a tall, slight young lady, with\npromise of great beauty in the face, which a year ago had only been\nremarkable for the fineness of the eyes.  Her complexion was clear now,\nalthough colourless--twelve months ago he would have called it sallow--her\ndelicate cheek was smooth as marble, her teeth were even and white, and\nher rare smiles called out a lovely dimple.\n\nShe met her former friend and lecturer with a grave shyness, for she\nremembered well how they had parted, and thought he could hardly have\nforgiven, much less forgotten, her passionate flinging away from him.  But\nthe truth was, after the first few hours of offended displeasure, he had\nceased to think of it at all.  She, poor child, by way of proving her\nrepentance, had tried hard to reform her boisterous tom-boy manners, in\norder to show him that, although she would not give up her dear old\nfriend Dixon, at his or anyone's bidding, she would strive to profit by\nhis lectures in all things reasonable.  The consequence was, that she\nsuddenly appeared to him as an elegant dignified young lady, instead of\nthe rough little girl he remembered.  Still below her somewhat formal\nmanners there lurked the old wild spirit, as he could plainly see after a\nlittle more watching; and he began to wish to call this out, and to\nstrive, by reminding her of old days, and all her childish frolics, to\nflavour her subdued manners and speech with a little of the former\noriginality.\n\nIn this he succeeded.  No one, neither Mr. Wilkins, nor Miss Monro, nor\nMr. Ness, saw what this young couple were about--they did not know it\nthemselves; but before the summer was over they were desperately in love\nwith each other, or perhaps I should rather say, Ellinor was desperately\nin love with him--he, as passionately as he could be with anyone; but in\nhim the intellect was superior in strength to either affections or\npassions.\n\nThe causes of the blindness of those around them were these: Mr. Wilkins\nstill considered Ellinor as a little girl, as his own pet, his darling,\nbut nothing more.  Miss Monro was anxious about her own improvement.  Mr.\nNess was deep in a new edition of \"Horace,\" which he was going to bring\nout with notes.  I believe Dixon would have been keener sighted, but\nEllinor kept Mr. Corbet and Dixon apart for obvious reasons--they were\neach her dear friends, but she knew that Mr. Corbet did not like Dixon,\nand suspected that the feeling was mutual.\n\nThe only change of circumstances between this year and the previous one\nconsisted in this development of attachment between the young people.\nOtherwise, everything went on apparently as usual.  With Ellinor the\ncourse of the day was something like this: up early and into the garden\nuntil breakfast time, when she made tea for her father and Miss Monro in\nthe dining-room, always taking care to lay a little nosegay of freshly-\ngathered flowers by her father's plate.  After breakfast, when the\nconversation had been on general and indifferent subjects, Mr. Wilkins\nwithdrew into the little study so often mentioned.  It opened out of a\npassage that ran between the dining-room and the kitchen, on the left\nhand of the hall.  Corresponding to the dining-room on the other side of\nthe hall was the drawing-room, with its side-window serving as a door\ninto a conservatory, and this again opened into the library.  Old Mr.\nWilkins had added a semicircular projection to the library, which was\nlighted by a dome above, and showed off his son's Italian purchases of\nsculpture.  The library was by far the most striking and agreeable room\nin the house; and the consequence was that the drawing-room was seldom\nused, and had the aspect of cold discomfort common to apartments rarely\noccupied.  Mr. Wilkins's study, on the other side of the house, was also\nan afterthought, built only a few years ago, and projecting from the\nregularity of the outside wall; a little stone passage led to it from the\nhall, small, narrow, and dark, and out of which no other door opened.\n\nThe study itself was a hexagon, one side window, one fireplace, and the\nremaining four sides occupied with doors, two of which have been already\nmentioned, another at the foot of the narrow winding stairs which led\nstraight into Mr. Wilkins's bedroom over the dining-room, and the fourth\nopening into a path through the shrubbery to the right of the\nflower-garden as you looked from the house.  This path led through the\nstable-yard, and then by a short cut right into Hamley, and brought you\nout close to Mr. Wilkins's office; it was by this way he always went and\nreturned to his business.  He used the study for a smoking and lounging\nroom principally, although he always spoke of it as a convenient place\nfor holding confidential communications with such of his clients as did\nnot like discussing their business within the possible hearing of all the\nclerks in his office.  By the outer door he could also pass to the\nstables, and see that proper care was taken at all times of his favourite\nand valuable horses.  Into this study Ellinor would follow him of a\nmorning, helping him on with his great-coat, mending his gloves, talking\nan infinite deal of merry fond nothing; and then, clinging to his arm,\nshe would accompany him in his visits to the stables, going up to the\nshyest horses, and petting them, and patting them, and feeding them with\nbread all the time that her father held converse with Dixon.  When he was\nfinally gone--and sometimes it was a long time first--she returned to the\nschoolroom to Miss Monro, and tried to set herself hard at work on her\nlessons.  But she had not much time for steady application; if her father\nhad cared for her progress in anything, she would and could have worked\nhard at that study or accomplishment; but Mr. Wilkins, the ease and\npleasure loving man, did not wish to make himself into the pedagogue, as\nhe would have considered it, if he had ever questioned Ellinor with a\nreal steady purpose of ascertaining her intellectual progress.  It was\nquite enough for him that her general intelligence and variety of\ndesultory and miscellaneous reading made her a pleasant and agreeable\ncompanion for his hours of relaxation.\n\nAt twelve o'clock, Ellinor put away her books with joyful eagerness,\nkissed Miss Monro, asked her if they should go a regular walk, and was\nalways rather thankful when it was decided that it would be better to\nstroll in the garden--a decision very often come to, for Miss Monro hated\nfatigue, hated dirt, hated scrambling, and dreaded rain; all of which are\nevils, the chances of which are never far distant from country walks.  So\nEllinor danced out into the garden, worked away among her flowers, played\nat the old games among the roots of the trees, and, when she could,\nseduced Dixon into the flower-garden to have a little consultation as to\nthe horses and dogs.  For it was one of her father's few strict rules\nthat Ellinor was never to go into the stable-yard unless he were with\nher; so these _tete-a-tetes_ with Dixon were always held in the flower-\ngarden, or bit of forest ground surrounding it.  Miss Monro sat and\nbasked in the sun, close to the dial, which made the centre of the gay\nflower-beds, upon which the dining-room and study windows looked.\n\nAt one o'clock, Ellinor and Miss Monro dined.  An hour was allowed for\nMiss Monro's digestion, which Ellinor again spent out of doors, and at\nthree, lessons began again and lasted till five.  At that time they went\nto dress preparatory for the schoolroom tea at half-past five.  After tea\nEllinor tried to prepare her lessons for the next day; but all the time\nshe was listening for her father's footstep--the moment she heard that,\nshe dashed down her book, and flew out of the room to welcome and kiss\nhim.  Seven was his dinner-hour; he hardly ever dined alone; indeed, he\noften dined from home four days out of seven, and when he had no\nengagement to take him out he liked to have some one to keep him company:\nMr. Ness very often, Mr. Corbet along with him if he was in Hamley, a\nstranger friend, or one of his clients.  Sometimes, reluctantly, and when\nhe fancied he could not avoid the attention without giving offence, Mr.\nWilkins would ask Mr. Dunster, and then the two would always follow\nEllinor into the library at a very early hour, as if their subjects for\n_tete-a-tete_ conversation were quite exhausted.  With all his other\nvisitors, Mr. Wilkins sat long--yes, and yearly longer; with Mr. Ness,\nbecause they became interested in each other's conversation; with some of\nthe others, because the wine was good, and the host hated to spare it.\n\nMr. Corbet used to leave his tutor and Mr. Wilkins and saunter into the\nlibrary.  There sat Ellinor and Miss Monro, each busy with their\nembroidery.  He would bring a stool to Ellinor's side, question and tease\nher, interest her, and they would become entirely absorbed in each other,\nMiss Monro's sense of propriety being entirely set at rest by the\nconsideration that Mr. Wilkins must know what he was about in allowing a\nyoung man to become thus intimate with his daughter, who, after all, was\nbut a child.\n\nMr. Corbet had lately fallen into the habit of walking up to Ford Bank\nfor _The Times_ every day, near twelve o'clock, and lounging about in the\ngarden until one; not exactly with either Ellinor or Miss Monro, but\ncertainly far more at the beck and call of the one than of the other.\n\nMiss Monro used to think he would have been glad to stay and lunch at\ntheir early dinner, but she never gave the invitation, and he could not\nwell stay without her expressed sanction.  He told Ellinor all about his\nmother and sisters, and their ways of going on, and spoke of them and of\nhis father as of people she was one day certain to know, and to know\nintimately; and she did not question or doubt this view of things; she\nsimply acquiesced.\n\nHe had some discussion with himself as to whether he should speak to her,\nand so secure her promise to be his before returning to Cambridge or not.\nHe did not like the formality of an application to Mr. Wilkins, which\nwould, after all, have been the proper and straightforward course to\npursue with a girl of her age--she was barely sixteen.  Not that he\nanticipated any difficulty on Mr. Wilkins's part; his approval of the\nintimacy which at their respective ages was pretty sure to lead to an\nattachment, was made as evident as could be by actions without words.  But\nthere would have to be reference to his own father, who had no notion of\nthe whole affair, and would be sure to treat it as a boyish fancy; as if\nat twenty-one Ralph was not a man, as clear and deliberative in knowing\nhis own mind, as resolute as he ever would be in deciding upon the course\nof exertion that should lead him to independence and fame, if such were\nto be attained by clear intellect and a strong will.\n\nNo; to Mr. Wilkins he would not speak for another year or two.\n\nBut should he tell Ellinor in direct terms of his love--his intention to\nmarry her?\n\nAgain he inclined to the more prudent course of silence.  He was not\nafraid of any change in his own inclinations: of them he was sure.  But\nhe looked upon it in this way: If he made a regular declaration to her\nshe would be bound to tell it to her father.  He should not respect her\nor like her so much if she did not.  And yet this course would lead to\nall the conversations, and discussions, and references to his own father,\nwhich made his own direct appeal to Mr. Wilkins appear a premature step\nto him.\n\nWhereas he was as sure of Ellinor's love for him as if she had uttered\nall the vows that women ever spoke; he knew even better than she did how\nfully and entirely that innocent girlish heart was his own.  He was too\nproud to dread her inconstancy for an instant; \"besides,\" as he went on\nto himself, as if to make assurance doubly sure, \"whom does she see?\nThose stupid Holsters, who ought to be only too proud of having such a\ngirl for their cousin, ignore her existence, and spoke slightingly of her\nfather only the very last time I dined there.  The country people in this\nprecisely Boeotian ---shire clutch at me because my father goes up to the\nPlantagenets for his pedigree--not one whit for myself--and neglect\nEllinor; and only condescend to her father because old Wilkins was nobody-\nknows-who's son.  So much the worse for them, but so much the better for\nme in this case.  I'm above their silly antiquated prejudices, and shall\nbe only too glad when the fitting time comes to make Ellinor my wife.\nAfter all, a prosperous attorney's daughter may not be considered an\nunsuitable match for me--younger son as I am.  Ellinor will make a\nglorious woman three or four years hence; just the style my father\nadmires--such a figure, such limbs.  I'll be patient, and bide my time,\nand watch my opportunities, and all will come right.\"\n\nSo he bade Ellinor farewell in a most reluctant and affectionate manner,\nalthough his words might have been spoken out in Hamley market-place, and\nwere little different from what he said to Miss Monro.  Mr. Wilkins half\nexpected a disclosure to himself of the love which he suspected in the\nyoung man; and when that did not come, he prepared himself for a\nconfidence from Ellinor.  But she had nothing to tell him, as he very\nwell perceived from the child's open unembarrassed manner when they were\nleft alone together after dinner.  He had refused an invitation, and\nshaken off Mr. Ness, in order to have this confidential _tete-a-tete_\nwith his motherless girl; and there was nothing to make confidence of.  He\nwas half inclined to be angry; but then he saw that, although sad, she\nwas so much at peace with herself and with the world, that he, always an\noptimist, began to think the young man had done wisely in not tearing\nopen the rosebud of her feelings too prematurely.\n\nThe next two years passed over in much the same way--or a careless\nspectator might have thought so.  I have heard people say, that if you\nlook at a regiment advancing with steady step over a plain on a review-\nday, you can hardly tell that they are not merely marking time on one\nspot of ground, unless you compare their position with some other object\nby which to mark their progress, so even is the repetition of the\nmovement.  And thus the sad events of the future life of this father and\ndaughter were hardly perceived in their steady advance, and yet over the\nmonotony and flat uniformity of their days sorrow came marching down upon\nthem like an armed man.  Long before Mr. Wilkins had recognised its\nshape, it was approaching him in the distance--as, in fact, it is\napproaching all of us at this very time; you, reader, I, writer, have\neach our great sorrow bearing down upon us.  It may be yet beyond the\ndimmest point of our horizon, but in the stillness of the night our\nhearts shrink at the sound of its coming footstep.  Well is it for those\nwho fall into the hands of the Lord rather than into the hands of men;\nbut worst of all is it for him who has hereafter to mingle the gall of\nremorse with the cup held out to him by his doom.\n\nMr. Wilkins took his ease and his pleasure yet more and more every year\nof his life; nor did the quality of his ease and his pleasure improve; it\nseldom does with self-indulgent people.  He cared less for any books that\nstrained his faculties a little--less for engravings and\nsculptures--perhaps more for pictures.  He spent extravagantly on his\nhorses; \"thought of eating and drinking.\"  There was no open vice in all\nthis, so that any awful temptation to crime should come down upon him,\nand startle him out of his mode of thinking and living; half the people\nabout him did much the same, as far as their lives were patent to his\nunreflecting observation.  But most of his associates had their duties to\ndo, and did them with a heart and a will, in the hours when he was not in\ntheir company.  Yes! I call them duties, though some of them might be\nself-imposed and purely social; they were engagements they had entered\ninto, either tacitly or with words, and that they fulfilled.  From Mr.\nHetherington, the Master of the Hounds, who was up at--no one knows what\nhour, to go down to the kennel and see that the men did their work well\nand thoroughly, to stern old Sir Lionel Playfair, the upright magistrate,\nthe thoughtful, conscientious landlord--they did their work according to\ntheir lights; there were few laggards among those with whom Mr. Wilkins\nassociated in the field or at the dinner-table.  Mr. Ness--though as a\nclergyman he was not so active as he might have been--yet even Mr. Ness\nfagged away with his pupils and his new edition of one of the classics.\nOnly Mr. Wilkins, dissatisfied with his position, neglected to fulfil the\nduties thereof.  He imitated the pleasures, and longed for the fancied\nleisure of those about him; leisure that he imagined would be so much\nmore valuable in the hands of a man like himself, full of intellectual\ntastes and accomplishments, than frittered away by dull boors of\nuntravelled, uncultivated squires--whose company, however, be it said by\nthe way, he never refused.\n\nAnd yet daily Mr. Wilkins was sinking from the intellectually to the\nsensually self-indulgent man.  He lay late in bed, and hated Mr. Dunster\nfor his significant glance at the office-clock when he announced to his\nmaster that such and such a client had been waiting more than an hour to\nkeep an appointment.  \"Why didn't you see him yourself, Dunster?  I'm\nsure you would have done quite as well as me,\" Mr. Wilkins sometimes\nreplied, partly with a view of saying something pleasant to the man whom\nhe disliked and feared.  Mr. Dunster always replied, in a meek matter-of-\nfact tone, \"Oh, sir, they wouldn't like to talk over their affairs with a\nsubordinate.\"\n\nAnd every time he said this, or some speech of the same kind, the idea\ncame more and more clearly into Mr. Wilkins's head, of how pleasant it\nwould be to himself to take Dunster into partnership, and thus throw all\nthe responsibility of the real work and drudgery upon his clerk's\nshoulders.  Importunate clients, who would make appointments at\nunseasonable hours and would keep to them, might confide in the partner,\nthough they would not in the clerk.  The great objections to this course\nwere, first and foremost, Mr. Wilkins's strong dislike to Mr. Dunster--his\nrepugnance to his company, his dress, his voice, his ways--all of which\nirritated his employer, till his state of feeling towards Dunster might\nbe called antipathy; next, Mr. Wilkins was fully aware of the fact that\nall Mr. Dunster's actions and words were carefully and thoughtfully pre-\narranged to further the great unspoken desire of his life--that of being\nmade a partner where he now was only a servant.  Mr. Wilkins took a\nmalicious pleasure in tantalizing Mr. Dunster by such speeches as the one\nI have just mentioned, which always seemed like an opening to the desired\nend, but still for a long time never led any further.  Yet all the while\nthat end was becoming more and more certain, and at last it was reached.\n\nMr. Dunster always suspected that the final push was given by some\ncircumstance from without; some reprimand for neglect--some threat of\nwithdrawal of business which his employer had received; but of this he\ncould not be certain; all he knew was, that Mr. Wilkins proposed the\npartnership to him in about as ungracious a way as such an offer could be\nmade; an ungraciousness which, after all, had so little effect on the\nreal matter in hand, that Mr. Dunster could pass over it with a private\nsneer, while taking all possible advantage of the tangible benefit it was\nnow in his power to accept.\n\nMr. Corbet's attachment to Ellinor had been formally disclosed to her\njust before this time.  He had left college, entered at the Middle\nTemple, and was fagging away at law, and feeling success in his own\npower; Ellinor was to \"come out\" at the next Hamley assemblies; and her\nlover began to be jealous of the possible admirers her striking\nappearance and piquant conversation might attract, and thought it a good\ntime to make the success of his suit certain by spoken words and\npromises.\n\nHe needed not have alarmed himself even enough to make him take this\nstep, if he had been capable of understanding Ellinor's heart as fully as\nhe did her appearance and conversation.  She never missed the absence of\nformal words and promises.  She considered herself as fully engaged to\nhim, as much pledged to marry him and no one else, before he had asked\nthe final question, as afterwards.  She was rather surprised at the\nnecessity for those decisive words,\n\n\"Ellinor, dearest, will you--can you marry me?\" and her reply was--given\nwith a deep blush I must record, and in a soft murmuring tone--\n\n\"Yes--oh, yes--I never thought of anything else.\"\n\n\"Then I may speak to your father, may not I, darling?\"\n\n\"He knows; I am sure he knows; and he likes you so much.  Oh, how happy I\nam!\"\n\n\"But still I must speak to him before I go.  When can I see him, my\nEllinor?  I must go back to town at four o'clock.\"\n\n\"I heard his voice in the stable-yard only just before you came.  Let me\ngo and find out if he is gone to the office yet.\"\n\nNo! to be sure he was not gone.  He was quietly smoking a cigar in his\nstudy, sitting in an easy-chair near the open window, and leisurely\nglancing at all the advertisements in _The Times_.  He hated going to the\noffice more and more since Dunster had become a partner; that fellow gave\nhimself such airs of investigation and reprehension.\n\nHe got up, took the cigar out of his mouth, and placed a chair for Mr.\nCorbet, knowing well why he had thus formally prefaced his entrance into\nthe room with a--\n\n\"Can I have a few minutes' conversation with you, Mr. Wilkins?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear fellow.  Sit down.  Will you have a cigar?\"\n\n\"No!  I never smoke.\"  Mr. Corbet despised all these kinds of\nindulgences, and put a little severity into his refusal, but quite\nunintentionally; for though he was thankful he was not as other men, he\nwas not at all the person to trouble himself unnecessarily with their\nreformation.\n\n\"I want to speak to you about Ellinor.  She says she thinks you must be\naware of our mutual attachment.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Wilkins--he had resumed his cigar, partly to conceal his\nagitation at what he knew was coming--\"I believe I have had my\nsuspicions.  It is not very long since I was young myself.\"  And he\nsighed over the recollection of Lettice, and his fresh, hopeful youth.\n\n\"And I hope, sir, as you have been aware of it, and have never manifested\nany disapprobation of it, that you will not refuse your consent--a\nconsent I now ask you for--to our marriage.\"\n\nMr. Wilkins did not speak for a little while--a touch, a thought, a word\nmore would have brought him to tears; for at the last he found it hard to\ngive the consent which would part him from his only child.  Suddenly he\ngot up, and putting his hand into that of the anxious lover (for his\nsilence had rendered Mr. Corbet anxious up to a certain point of\nperplexity--he could not understand the implied he would and he would\nnot), Mr. Wilkins said,\n\n\"Yes!  God bless you both!  I will give her to you, some day--only it\nmust be a long time first.  And now go away--go back to her--for I can't\nstand this much longer.\"\n\nMr. Corbet returned to Ellinor.  Mr. Wilkins sat down and buried his head\nin his hands, then went to his stable, and had Wildfire saddled for a\ngood gallop over the country.  Mr. Dunster waited for him in vain at the\noffice, where an obstinate old country gentleman from a distant part of\nthe shire would ignore Dunster's existence as a partner, and\npertinaciously demanded to see Mr. Wilkins on important business.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nA few days afterwards, Ellinor's father bethought himself that same\nfurther communication ought to take place between him and his daughter's\nlover regarding the approval of the family of the latter to the young\nman's engagement, and he accordingly wrote a very gentlemanly letter,\nsaying that of course he trusted that Ralph had informed his father of\nhis engagement; that Mr. Corbet was well known to Mr. Wilkins by\nreputation, holding the position which he did in Shropshire, but that as\nMr. Wilkins did not pretend to be in the same station of life, Mr. Corbet\nmight possibly never even have heard of his name, although in his own\ncounty it was well known as having been for generations that of the\nprincipal conveyancer and land-agent of ---shire; that his wife had been\na member of the old knightly family of Holsters, and that he himself was\ndescended from a younger branch of the South Wales De Wintons, or\nWilkins; that Ellinor, as his only child, would naturally inherit all his\nproperty, but that in the meantime, of course, some settlement upon her\nwould be made, the nature of which might be decided nearer the time of\nthe marriage.\n\nIt was a very good straightforward letter and well fitted for the purpose\nto which Mr. Wilkins knew it would be applied--of being forwarded to the\nyoung man's father.  One would have thought that it was not an engagement\nso disproportionate in point of station as to cause any great opposition\non that score; but, unluckily, Captain Corbet, the heir and eldest son,\nhad just formed a similar engagement with Lady Maria Brabant, the\ndaughter of one of the proudest earls in ---shire, who had always\nresented Mr. Wilkins's appearance on the field as an insult to the\ncounty, and ignored his presence at every dinner-table where they met.\nLady Maria was visiting the Corbets at the very time when Ralph's letter,\nenclosing Mr. Wilkins's, reached the paternal halls, and she merely\nrepeated her father's opinions when Mrs. Corbet and her daughters\nnaturally questioned her as to who these Wilkinses were; they remembered\nthe name in Ralph's letters formerly; the father was some friend of Mr.\nNess's, the clergyman with whom Ralph had read; they believed Ralph used\nto dine with these Wilkinses sometimes, along with Mr. Ness.\n\nLady Maria was a goodnatured girl, and meant no harm in repeating her\nfather's words; touched up, it is true, by some of the dislike she\nherself felt to the intimate alliance proposed, which would make her\nsister-in-law to the daughter of an \"upstart attorney,\" \"not received in\nthe county,\" \"always trying to push his way into the set above him,\"\n\"claiming connection with the De Wintons of --- Castle, who, as she well\nknew, only laughed when he was spoken of, and said they were more rich in\nrelations than they were aware of\"--\"not people papa would ever like her\nto know, whatever might be the family connection.\"\n\nThese little speeches told in a way which the girl who uttered them did\nnot intend they should.  Mrs. Corbet and her daughters set themselves\nviolently against this foolish entanglement of Ralph's; they would not\ncall it an engagement.  They argued, and they urged, and they pleaded,\ntill the squire, anxious for peace at any price, and always more under\nthe sway of the people who were with him, however unreasonable they might\nbe, than of the absent, even though these had the wisdom of Solomon or\nthe prudence and sagacity of his son Ralph, wrote an angry letter, saying\nthat, as Ralph was of age, of course he had a right to please himself,\ntherefore all his father could say was, that the engagement was not at\nall what either he or Ralph's mother had expected or hoped; that it was a\ndegradation to the family just going to ally themselves with a peer of\nJames the First's creation; that of course Ralph must do what he liked,\nbut that if he married this girl he must never expect to have her\nreceived by the Corbets of Corbet Hall as a daughter.  The squire was\nrather satisfied with his production, and took it to show it to his wife;\nbut she did not think it was strong enough, and added a little postscript\n\n   \"DEAR RALPH,\n\n   \"Though, as second son, you are entitled to Bromley at my death, yet I\n   can do much to make the estate worthless.  Hitherto, regard for you\n   has prevented my taking steps as to sale of timber, &c., which would\n   materially increase your sisters' portions; this just measure I shall\n   infallibly take if I find you persevere in keeping to this silly\n   engagement.  Your father's disapproval is always a sufficient reason\n   to allege.\"\n\nRalph was annoyed at the receipt of these letters, though he only smiled\nas he locked them up in his desk.\n\n\"Dear old father! how he blusters!  As to my mother, she is reasonable\nwhen I talk to her.  Once give her a definite idea of what Ellinor's\nfortune will be, and let her, if she chooses, cut down her timber--a\nthreat she has held over me ever since I knew what a rocking-horse was,\nand which I have known to be illegal these ten years past--and she'll\ncome round.  I know better than they do how Reginald has run up\npost-obits, and as for that vulgar high-born Lady Maria they are all so\nfull of, why, she is a Flanders mare to my Ellinor, and has not a silver\npenny to cross herself with, besides!  I bide my time, you dear good\npeople!\"\n\nHe did not think it necessary to reply to these letters immediately, nor\ndid he even allude to their contents in his to Ellinor.  Mr. Wilkins, who\nhad been very well satisfied with his own letter to the young man, and\nhad thought that it must be equally agreeable to every one, was not at\nall suspicious of any disapproval, because the fact of a distinct\nsanction on the part of Mr. Ralph Corbet's friends to his engagement was\nnot communicated to him.\n\nAs for Ellinor, she trembled all over with happiness.  Such a summer for\nthe blossoming of flowers and ripening of fruit had not been known for\nyears; it seemed to her as if bountiful loving Nature wanted to fill the\ncup of Ellinor's joy to overflowing, and as if everything, animate and\ninanimate, sympathised with her happiness.  Her father was well, and\napparently content.  Miss Monro was very kind.  Dixon's lameness was\nquite gone off.  Only Mr. Dunster came creeping about the house, on\npretence of business, seeking out her father, and disturbing all his\nleisure with his dust-coloured parchment-skinned careworn face, and\nseeming to disturb the smooth current of her daily life whenever she saw\nhim.\n\nEllinor made her appearance at the Hamley assemblies, but with less\n_eclat_ than either her father or her lover expected.  Her beauty and\nnatural grace were admired by those who could discriminate; but to the\ngreater number there was (what they called) \"a want of style\"--want of\nelegance there certainly was not, for her figure was perfect, and though\nshe moved shyly, she moved well.  Perhaps it was not a good place for a\ncorrect appreciation of Miss Wilkins; some of the old dowagers thought it\na piece of presumption in her to be there at all--but the Lady Holster of\nthe day (who remembered her husband's quarrel with Mr. Wilkins, and\nlooked away whenever Ellinor came near) resented this opinion.  \"Miss\nWilkins is descended from Sir Frank's family, one of the oldest in the\ncounty; the objection might have been made years ago to the father, but\nas he had been received, she did not know why Miss Wilkins was to be\nalluded to as out of her place.\"  Ellinor's greatest enjoyment in the\nevening was to hear her father say, after all was over, and they were\ndriving home--\n\n\"Well, I thought my Nelly the prettiest girl there, and I think I know\nsome other people who would have said the same if they could have spoken\nout.\"\n\n\"Thank you, papa,\" said Ellinor, squeezing his hand, which she held.  She\nthought he alluded to the absent Ralph as the person who would have\nagreed with him, had he had the opportunity of seeing her; but no, he\nseldom thought much of the absent; but had been rather flattered by\nseeing Lord Hildebrand take up his glass for the apparent purpose of\nwatching Ellinor.\n\n\"Your pearls, too, were as handsome as any in the room, child--but we\nmust have them re-set; the sprays are old-fashioned now.  Let me have\nthem to-morrow to send up to Hancock.\"\n\n\"Papa, please, I had rather keep them as they are--as mamma wore them.\"\n\nHe was touched in a minute.\n\n\"Very well, darling.  God bless you for thinking of it!\"\n\nBut he ordered her a set of sapphires instead, for the next assembly.\n\nThese balls were not such as to intoxicate Ellinor with success, and make\nher in love with gaiety.  Large parties came from the different country-\nhouses in the neighbourhood, and danced with each other.  When they had\nexhausted the resources they brought with them, they had generally a few\ndances to spare for friends of the same standing with whom they were most\nintimate.  Ellinor came with her father, and joined an old card-playing\ndowager, by way of a chaperone--the said dowager being under old business\nobligations to the firm of Wilkins and Son, and apologizing to all her\nacquaintances for her own weak condescension to Mr. Wilkins's foible in\nwishing to introduce his daughter into society above her natural sphere.\nIt was upon this lady, after she had uttered some such speech as the one\nI have just mentioned, that Lady Holster had come down with the pedigree\nof Ellinor's mother.  But though the old dowager had drawn back a little\ndiscomfited at my lady's reply, she was not more attentive to Ellinor in\nconsequence.  She allowed Mr. Wilkins to bring in his daughter and place\nher on the crimson sofa beside her; spoke to her occasionally in the\ninterval that elapsed before the rubbers could be properly arranged in\nthe card-room; invited the girl to accompany her to that sober amusement,\nand on Ellinor's declining, and preferring to remain with her father, the\ndowager left her with a sweet smile on her plump countenance, and an\napproving conscience somewhere within her portly frame, assuring her that\nshe had done all that could possibly have been expected from her towards\n\"that good Wilkins's daughter.\"  Ellinor stood by her father watching the\ndances, and thankful for the occasional chance of a dance.  While she had\nbeen sitting by her chaperone, Mr. Wilkins had made the tour of the room,\ndropping out the little fact of his daughter's being present wherever he\nthought the seed likely to bring forth the fruit of partners.  And some\ncame because they liked Mr. Wilkins, and some asked Ellinor because they\nhad done their duty dances to their own party, and might please\nthemselves.  So that she usually had an average of one invitation to\nevery three dances; and this principally towards the end of the evening.\n\nBut considering her real beauty, and the care which her father always\ntook about her appearance, she met with far less than her due of\nadmiration.  Admiration she did not care for; partners she did; and\nsometimes felt mortified when she had to sit or stand quiet during all\nthe first part of the evening.  If it had not been for her father's\nwishes she would much rather have stayed at home; but, nevertheless, she\ntalked even to the irresponsive old dowager, and fairly chatted to her\nfather when she got beside him, because she did not like him to fancy\nthat she was not enjoying herself.\n\nAnd, indeed, she had so much happiness in the daily course of this part\nof her life, that, on looking back upon it afterwards, she could not\nimagine anything brighter than it had been.  The delight of receiving her\nlover's letters--the anxious happiness of replying to them (always a\nlittle bit fearful lest she should not express herself and her love in\nthe precisely happy medium becoming a maiden)--the father's love and\nsatisfaction in her--the calm prosperity of the whole household--was\ndelightful at the time, and, looking back upon it, it was dreamlike.\n\nOccasionally Mr. Corbet came down to see her.  He always slept on these\noccasions at Mr. Ness's; but he was at Ford Bank the greater part of the\none day between two nights that he allowed himself for the length of his\nvisits.  And even these short peeps were not frequently taken.  He was\nworking hard at law: fagging at it tooth and nail; arranging his whole\nlife so as best to promote the ends of his ambition; feeling a delight in\nsurpassing and mastering his fellows--those who started in the race at\nthe same time.  He read Ellinor's letters over and over again; nothing\nelse beside law-books.  He perceived the repressed love hidden away in\nsubdued expressions in her communications, with an amused pleasure at the\nattempt at concealment.  He was glad that her gaieties were not more gay;\nhe was glad that she was not too much admired, although a little\nindignant at the want of taste on the part of the ---shire gentlemen.  But\nif other admirers had come prominently forward, he would have had to take\nsome more decided steps to assert his rights than he had hitherto done;\nfor he had caused Ellinor to express a wish to her father that her\nengagement should not be too much talked about until nearer the time when\nit would be prudent for him to marry her.  He thought that the knowledge\nof this, the only imprudently hasty step he ever meant to take in his\nlife, might go against his character for wisdom, if the fact became known\nwhile he was as yet only a student.  Mr. Wilkins wondered a little; but\nacceded, as he always did, to any of Ellinor's requests.  Mr. Ness was a\nconfidant, of course, and some of Lady Maria's connections heard of it,\nand forgot it again very soon; and, as it happened, no one else was\nsufficiently interested in Ellinor to care to ascertain the fact.\n\nAll this time, Mr. Ralph Corbet maintained a very quietly decided\nattitude towards his own family.  He was engaged to Miss Wilkins; and all\nhe could say was, he felt sorry that they disapproved of it.  He was not\nable to marry just at present, and before the time for his marriage\narrived, he trusted that his family would take a more reasonable view of\nthings, and be willing to receive her as his wife with all becoming\nrespect or affection.  This was the substance of what he repeated in\ndifferent forms in reply to his father's angry letters.  At length, his\ninvariable determination made way with his father; the paternal\nthunderings were subdued to a distant rumbling in the sky; and presently\nthe inquiry was broached as to how much fortune Miss Wilkins would have;\nhow much down on her marriage; what were the eventual probabilities.  Now\nthis was a point which Mr. Ralph Corbet himself wished to be informed\nupon.  He had not thought much about it in making the engagement; he had\nbeen too young, or too much in love.  But an only child of a wealthy\nattorney ought to have something considerable; and an allowance so as to\nenable the young couple to start housekeeping in a moderately good part\nof town, would be an advantage to him in his profession.  So he replied\nto his father, adroitly suggesting that a letter containing certain\nmodifications of the inquiry which had been rather roughly put in Mr.\nCorbet's last, should be sent to him, in order that he might himself\nascertain from Mr. Wilkins what were Ellinor's prospects as regarded\nfortune.\n\nThe desired letter came; but not in such a form that he could pass it on\nto Mr. Wilkins; he preferred to make quotations, and even these\nquotations were a little altered and dressed before he sent them on.  The\ngist of his letter to Mr. Wilkins was this.  He stated that he hoped soon\nto be in a position to offer Ellinor a home; that he anticipated a steady\nprogress in his profession, and consequently in his income; but that\ncontingencies might arise, as his father suggested, which would deprive\nhim of the power of earning a livelihood, perhaps when it might be more\nrequired than it would be at first; that it was true that, after his\nmother's death a small estate in Shropshire would come to him as second\nson, and of course Ellinor would receive the benefit of this property,\nsecured to her legally as Mr. Wilkins thought best--that being a matter\nfor after discussion--but that at present his father was anxious, as\nmight be seen from the extract to ascertain whether Mr. Wilkins could\nsecure him from the contingency of having his son's widow and possible\nchildren thrown upon his hands, by giving Ellinor a dowry; and if so, it\nwas gently insinuated, what would be the amount of the same.\n\nWhen Mr. Wilkins received this letter it startled him out of a happy day-\ndream.  He liked Ralph Corbet and the whole connection quite well enough\nto give his consent to an engagement; and sometimes even he was glad to\nthink that Ellinor's future was assured, and that she would have a\nprotector and friends after he was dead and gone.  But he did not want\nthem to assume their responsibilities so soon.  He had not distinctly\ncontemplated her marriage as an event likely to happen before his death.\nHe could not understand how his own life would go on without her: or\nindeed why she and Ralph Corbet could not continue just as they were at\npresent.  He came down to breakfast with the letter in his hand.  By\nEllinor's blushes, as she glanced at the handwriting, he knew that she\nhad heard from her lover by the same post; by her tender\ncaresses--caresses given as if to make up for the pain which the prospect\nof her leaving him was sure to cause him--he was certain that she was\naware of the contents of the letter.  Yet he put it in his pocket, and\ntried to forget it.\n\nHe did this not merely from his reluctance to complete any arrangements\nwhich might facilitate Ellinor's marriage.  There was a further annoyance\nconnected with the affair.  His money matters had been for some time in\nan involved state; he had been living beyond his income, even reckoning\nthat, as he always did, at the highest point which it ever touched.  He\nkept no regular accounts, reasoning with himself--or, perhaps, I should\nrather say persuading himself--that there was no great occasion for\nregular accounts, when he had a steady income arising from his\nprofession, as well as the interest of a good sum of money left him by\nhis father; and when, living in his own house near a country town where\nprovisions were cheap, his expenditure for his small family--only one\nchild--could never amount to anything like his incomings from the above-\nmentioned sources.  But servants and horses, and choice wines and rare\nfruit-trees, and a habit of purchasing any book or engraving that may\ntake the fancy, irrespective of the price, run away with money, even\nthough there be but one child.  A year or two ago, Mr. Wilkins had been\nstartled into a system of exaggerated retrenchment--retrenchment which\nonly lasted about six weeks--by the sudden bursting of a bubble\nspeculation in which he had invested a part of his father's savings.  But\nas soon as the change in his habits, necessitated by his new economies,\nbecame irksome, he had comforted himself for his relapse into his former\neasy extravagance of living by remembering the fact that Ellinor was\nengaged to the son of a man of large property: and that though Ralph was\nonly the second son, yet his mother's estate must come to him, as Mr.\nNess had already mentioned, on first hearing of her engagement.\n\nMr. Wilkins did not doubt that he could easily make Ellinor a fitting\nallowance, or even pay down a requisite dowry; but the doing so would\ninvolve an examination into the real state of his affairs, and this\ninvolved distasteful trouble.  He had no idea how much more than mere\ntemporary annoyance would arise out of the investigation.  Until it was\nmade, he decided in his own mind that he would not speak to Ellinor on\nthe subject of her lover's letter.  So for the next few days she was kept\nin suspense, seeing little of her father; and during the short times she\nwas with him she was made aware that he was nervously anxious to keep the\nconversation engaged on general topics rather than on the one which she\nhad at heart.  As I have already said, Mr. Corbet had written to her by\nthe same post as that on which he sent the letter to her father, telling\nher of its contents, and begging her (in all those sweet words which\nlovers know how to use) to urge her father to compliance for his\nsake--his, her lover's--who was pining and lonely in all the crowds of\nLondon, since her loved presence was not there.  He did not care for\nmoney, save as a means of hastening their marriage; indeed, if there were\nonly some income fixed, however small--some time for their marriage\nfixed, however distant--he could be patient.  He did not want superfluity\nof wealth; his habits were simple, as she well knew; and money enough\nwould be theirs in time, both from her share of contingencies, and the\ncertainty of his finally possessing Bromley.\n\nEllinor delayed replying to this letter until her father should have\nspoken to her on the subject.  But as she perceived that he avoided all\nsuch conversation, the young girl's heart failed her.  She began to blame\nherself for wishing to leave him, to reproach herself for being accessory\nto any step which made him shun being alone with her, and look distressed\nand full of care as he did now.  It was the usual struggle between father\nand lover for the possession of love, instead of the natural and graceful\nresignation of the parent to the prescribed course of things; and, as\nusual, it was the poor girl who bore the suffering for no fault of her\nown: although she blamed herself for being the cause of the disturbance\nin the previous order of affairs.  Ellinor had no one to speak to\nconfidentially but her father and her lover, and when they were at issue\nshe could talk openly to neither, so she brooded over Mr. Corbet's\nunanswered letter, and her father's silence, and became pale and\ndispirited.  Once or twice she looked up suddenly, and caught her\nfather's eye gazing upon her with a certain wistful anxiety; but the\ninstant she saw this he pulled himself up, as it were, and would begin\ntalking gaily about the small topics of the day.\n\nAt length Mr. Corbet grew impatient at not hearing either from Mr.\nWilkins or Ellinor, and wrote urgently to the former, making known to him\na new proposal suggested to him by his father, which was, that a certain\nsum should be paid down by Mr. Wilkins to be applied, under the\nmanagement of trustees, to the improvement of the Bromley estate, out of\nthe profits of which, or other sources in the elder Mr. Corbet's hands, a\nheavy rate of interest should be paid on this advance, which would secure\nan income to the young couple immediately, and considerably increase the\nvalue of the estate upon which Ellinor's settlement was to be made.  The\nterms offered for this laying down of ready money were so advantageous,\nthat Mr. Wilkins was strongly tempted to accede to them at once; as\nEllinor's pale cheek and want of appetite had only that very morning\nsmote upon his conscience, and this immediate transfer of ready money was\nas a sacrifice, a soothing balm to his self-reproach, and laziness and\ndislike to immediate unpleasantness of action had its counterbalancing\nweakness in imprudence.  Mr. Wilkins made some rough calculations on a\npiece of paper--deeds, and all such tests of accuracy, being down at the\noffice; discovered that he could pay down the sum required; wrote a\nletter agreeing to the proposal, and before he sealed it called Ellinor\ninto his study, and bade her read what he had been writing and tell him\nwhat she thought of it.  He watched the colour come rushing into her\nwhite face, her lips quiver and tremble, and even before the letter was\nended she was in his arms kissing him, and thanking him with blushing\ncaresses rather than words.\n\n\"There, there!\" said he, smiling and sighing; \"that will do.  Why, I do\nbelieve you took me for a hard-hearted father, just like a heroine's\nfather in a book.  You've looked as woe-begone this week past as Ophelia.\nOne can't make up one's mind in a day about such sums of money as this,\nlittle woman; and you should have let your old father have time to\nconsider.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa; I was only afraid you were angry.\"\n\n\"Well, if I was a bit perplexed, seeing you look so ill and pining was\nnot the way to bring me round.  Old Corbet, I must say, is trying to make\na good bargain for his son.  It is well for me that I have never been an\nextravagant man.\"\n\n\"But, papa, we don't want all this much.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! it is all right.  You shall go into their family as a well-\nportioned girl, if you can't go as a Lady Maria.  Come, don't trouble\nyour little head any more about it.  Give me one more kiss, and then\nwe'll go and order the horses, and have a ride together, by way of\nkeeping holiday.  I deserve a holiday, don't I, Nelly?\"\n\nSome country people at work at the roadside, as the father and daughter\npassed along, stopped to admire their bright happy looks, and one spoke\nof the hereditary handsomeness of the Wilkins family (for the old man,\nthe present Mr. Wilkins's father, had been fine-looking in his drab\nbreeches and gaiters, and usual assumption of a yeoman's dress).  Another\nsaid it was easy for the rich to be handsome; they had always plenty to\neat, and could ride when they were tired of walking, and had no care for\nthe morrow to keep them from sleeping at nights.  And, in sad\nacquiescence with their contrasted lot, the men went on with their\nhedging and ditching in silence.\n\nAnd yet, if they had known--if the poor did know--the troubles and\ntemptations of the rich; if those men had foreseen the lot darkening over\nthe father, and including the daughter in its cloud; if Mr. Wilkins\nhimself had even imagined such a future possible . . . Well, there was\ntruth in the old heathen saying, \"Let no man be envied till his death.\"\n\nEllinor had no more rides with her father; no, not ever again; though\nthey had stopped that afternoon at the summit of a breezy common, and\nlooked at a ruined hall, not so very far off; and discussed whether they\ncould reach it that day, and decided that it was too far away for\nanything but a hurried inspection, and that some day soon they would make\nthe old place into the principal object of an excursion.  But a rainy\ntime came on, when no rides were possible; and whether it was the\ninfluence of the weather, or some other care or trouble that oppressed\nhim, Mr. Wilkins seemed to lose all wish for much active exercise, and\nrather sought a stimulus to his spirits and circulation in wine.  But of\nthis Ellinor was innocently unaware.  He seemed dull and weary, and sat\nlong, drowsing and drinking after dinner.  If the servants had not been\nso fond of him for much previous generosity and kindness, they would have\ncomplained now, and with reason, of his irritability, for all sorts of\nthings seemed to annoy him.\n\n\"You should get the master to take a ride with you, miss,\" said Dixon,\none day as he was putting Ellinor on her horse.  \"He's not looking well,\nhe's studying too much at the office.\"\n\nBut when Ellinor named it to her father, he rather hastily replied that\nit was all very well for women to ride out whenever they liked--men had\nsomething else to do; and then, as he saw her look grave and puzzled, he\nsoftened down his abrupt saying by adding that Dunster had been making a\nfuss about his partner's non-attendance, and altogether taking a good\ndeal upon himself in a very offensive way, so that he thought it better\nto go pretty regularly to the office, in order to show him who was\nmaster--senior partner, and head of the business, at any rate.\n\nEllinor sighed a little over her disappointment at her father's\npreoccupation, and then forgot her own little regret in anger at Mr.\nDunster, who had seemed all along to be a thorn in her father's side, and\nhad latterly gained some power and authority over him, the exercise of\nwhich, Ellinor could not help thinking, was a very impertinent line of\nconduct from a junior partner, so lately only a paid clerk, to his\nsuperior.  There was a sense of something wrong in the Ford Bank\nhousehold for many weeks about this time.  Mr. Wilkins was not like\nhimself, and his cheerful ways and careless genial speeches were missed,\neven on the days when he was not irritable, and evidently uneasy with\nhimself and all about him.  The spring was late in coming, and cold rain\nand sleet made any kind of out-door exercise a trouble and discomfort\nrather than a bright natural event in the course of the day.  All sound\nof winter gaieties, of assemblies and meets, and jovial dinners, had died\naway, and the summer pleasures were as yet unthought of.  Still Ellinor\nhad a secret perennial source of sunshine in her heart; whenever she\nthought of Ralph she could not feel much oppression from the present\nunspoken and indistinct gloom.  He loved her; and oh, how she loved him!\nand perhaps this very next autumn--but that depended on his own success\nin his profession.  After all, if it was not this autumn it would be the\nnext; and with the letters that she received weekly, and the occasional\nvisits that her lover ran down to Hamley to pay Mr. Ness, Ellinor felt as\nif she would almost prefer the delay of the time when she must leave her\nfather's for a husband's roof.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nAt Easter--just when the heavens and earth were looking their dreariest,\nfor Easter fell very early this year--Mr. Corbet came down.  Mr. Wilkins\nwas too busy to see much of him; they were together even less than usual,\nalthough not less friendly when they did meet.  But to Ellinor the visit\nwas one of unmixed happiness.  Hitherto she had always had a little fear\nmingled up with her love of Mr. Corbet; but his manners were softened,\nhis opinions less decided and abrupt, and his whole treatment of her\nshowed such tenderness, that the young girl basked and revelled in it.\nOne or two of their conversations had reference to their future married\nlife in London; and she then perceived, although it did not jar against\nher, that her lover had not forgotten his ambition in his love.  He tried\nto inoculate her with something of his own craving for success in life;\nbut it was all in vain: she nestled to him, and told him she did not care\nto be the Lord Chancellor's wife--wigs and wool-sacks were not in her\nline; only if he wished it, she would wish it.\n\nThe last two days of his stay the weather changed.  Sudden heat burst\nforth, as it does occasionally for a few hours even in our chilly English\nspring.  The grey-brown bushes and trees started almost with visible\nprogress into the tender green shade which is the forerunner of the\nbursting leaves.  The sky was of full cloudless blue.  Mr. Wilkins was to\ncome home pretty early from the office to ride out with his daughter and\nher lover; but, after waiting some time for him, it grew too late, and\nthey were obliged to give up the project.  Nothing would serve Ellinor,\nthen, but that she must carry out a table and have tea in the garden, on\nthe sunny side of the tree, among the roots of which she used to play\nwhen a child.  Miss Monro objected a little to this caprice of Ellinor's,\nsaying that it was too early for out-of-door meals; but Mr. Corbet\noverruled all objections, and helped her in her gay preparations.  She\nalways kept to the early hours of her childhood, although she, as then,\nregularly sat with her father at his late dinner; and this meal _al\nfresco_ was to be a reality to her and Miss Monro.  There was a place\narranged for her father, and she seized upon him as he was coming from\nthe stable-yard, by the shrubbery path, to his study, and with merry\nplayfulness made him a prisoner, accusing him of disappointing them of\ntheir ride, and drawing him more than half unwilling, to his chair by the\ntable.  But he was silent, and almost sad: his presence damped them all;\nthey could hardly tell why, for he did not object to anything, though he\nseemed to enjoy nothing, and only to force a smile at Ellinor's\noccasional sallies.  These became more and more rare as she perceived her\nfather's depression.  She watched him anxiously.  He perceived it, and\nsaid--shivering in that strange unaccountable manner which is popularly\nexplained by the expression that some one is passing over the earth that\nwill one day form your grave--\"Ellinor! this is not a day for out-of-door\ntea.  I never felt so chilly a spot in my life.  I cannot keep from\nshaking where I sit.  I must leave this place, my dear, in spite of all\nyour good tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa!  I am so sorry.  But look how full that hot sun's rays come on\nthis turf.  I thought I had chosen such a capital spot!\"\n\nBut he got up and persisted in leaving the table, although he was\nevidently sorry to spoil the little party.  He walked up and down the\ngravel walk, close by them, talking to them as he kept passing by and\ntrying to cheer them up.\n\n\"Are you warmer now, papa?\" asked Ellinor.\n\n\"Oh, yes!  All right.  It's only that place that seems so chilly and\ndamp.  I'm as warm as a toast now.\"\n\nThe next morning Mr. Corbet left them.  The unseasonably fine weather\npassed away too, and all things went back to their rather grey and dreary\naspect; but Ellinor was too happy to feel this much, knowing what absent\nlove existed for her alone, and from this knowledge unconsciously\ntrusting in the sun behind the clouds.\n\nI have said that few or none in the immediate neighbourhood of Hamley,\nbeside their own household and Mr. Ness, knew of Ellinor's engagement.  At\none of the rare dinner-parties to which she accompanied her father--it\nwas at the old lady's house who chaperoned her to the assemblies--she was\ntaken in to dinner by a young clergyman staying in the neighbourhood.  He\nhad just had a small living given to him in his own county, and he felt\nas if this was a great step in his life.  He was good, innocent, and\nrather boyish in appearance.  Ellinor was happy and at her ease, and\nchatted away to this Mr. Livingstone on many little points of interest\nwhich they found they had in common: church music, and the difficulty\nthey had in getting people to sing in parts; Salisbury Cathedral, which\nthey had both seen; styles of church architecture, Ruskin's works, and\nparish schools, in which Mr. Livingstone was somewhat shocked to find\nthat Ellinor took no great interest.  When the gentleman came in from the\ndining-room, it struck Ellinor, for the first time in her life, that her\nfather had taken more wine than was good for him.  Indeed, this had\nrather become a habit with him of late; but as he always tried to go\nquietly off to his own room when such had been the case, his daughter had\nnever been aware of it before, and the perception of it now made her\ncheeks hot with shame.  She thought that everyone must be as conscious of\nhis altered manner and way of speaking as she was, and after a pause of\nsick silence, during which she could not say a word, she set to and\ntalked to Mr. Livingstone about parish schools, anything, with redoubled\nvigour and apparent interest, in order to keep one or two of the company,\nat least, from noticing what was to her so painfully obvious.\n\nThe effect of her behaviour was far more than she had intended.  She kept\nMr. Livingstone, it is true, from observing her father, but she also\nriveted his attention on herself.  He had thought her very pretty and\nagreeable during dinner: but after dinner he considered her bewitching,\nirresistible.  He dreamed of her all night, and wakened up the next\nmorning to a calculation of how far his income would allow him to furnish\nhis pretty new parsonage with that crowning blessing, a wife.  For a day\nor two he did up little sums, and sighed, and thought of Ellinor, her\nface listening with admiring interest to his sermons, her arm passed into\nhis as they went together round the parish; her sweet voice instructing\nclasses in his schools--turn where he would, in his imagination Ellinor's\npresence rose up before him.\n\nThe consequence was that he wrote an offer, which he found a far more\nperplexing piece of composition than a sermon; a real hearty expression\nof love, going on, over all obstacles, to a straightforward explanation\nof his present prospects and future hopes, and winding up with the\ninformation that on the succeeding morning he would call to know whether\nhe might speak to Mr. Wilkins on the subject of this letter.  It was\ngiven to Ellinor in the evening, as she was sitting with Miss Monro in\nthe library.  Mr. Wilkins was dining out, she hardly knew where, as it\nwas a sudden engagement, of which he had sent word from the office--a\ngentleman's dinner-party, she supposed, as he had dressed in Hamley\nwithout coming home.  Ellinor turned over the letter when it was brought\nto her, as some people do when they cannot recognise the handwriting, as\nif to discover from paper or seal what two moments would assure them of,\nif they opened the letter and looked at the signature.  Ellinor could not\nguess who had written it by any outward sign; but the moment she saw the\nname \"Herbert Livingstone,\" the meaning of the letter flashed upon her\nand she coloured all over.  She put the letter away, unread, for a few\nminutes, and then made some excuse for leaving the room and going\nupstairs.  When safe in her bed-chamber, she read the young man's eager\nwords with a sense of self-reproach.  How must she, engaged to one man,\nhave been behaving to another, if this was the result of a single\nevening's interview?  The self-reproach was unjustly bestowed; but with\nthat we have nothing to do.  She made herself very miserable; and at last\nwent down with a heavy heart to go on with Dante, and rummage up words in\nthe dictionary.  All the time she seemed to Miss Monro to be plodding on\nwith her Italian more diligently and sedately than usual, she was\nplanning in her own mind to speak to her father as soon as he returned\n(and he had said that he should not be late), and beg him to undo the\nmischief she had done by seeing Mr. Livingstone the next morning, and\nfrankly explaining the real state of affairs to him.  But she wanted to\nread her letter again, and think it all over in peace; and so, at an\nearly hour, she wished Miss Monro good-night, and went up into her own\nroom above the drawing-room, and overlooking the flower-garden and\nshrubbery-path to the stable-yard, by which her father was sure to\nreturn.  She went upstairs and studied her letter well, and tried to\nrecall all her speeches and conduct on that miserable evening--as she\nthought it then--not knowing what true misery was.  Her head ached, and\nshe put out the candle, and went and sat on the window-seat, looking out\ninto the moonlit garden, watching for her father.  She opened the window;\npartly to cool her forehead, partly to enable her to call down softly\nwhen she should see him coming along.  By-and-by the door from the stable-\nyard into the shrubbery clicked and opened, and in a moment she saw Mr.\nWilkins moving through the bushes; but not alone, Mr. Dunster was with\nhim, and the two were talking together in rather excited tones,\nimmediately lost to hearing, however, as they entered Mr. Wilkins's study\nby the outer door.\n\n\"They have been dining together somewhere.  Probably at Mr. Hanbury's\"\n(the Hamley brewer), thought Ellinor.  \"But how provoking that he should\nhave come home with papa this night of all nights!\"\n\nTwo or three times before Mr. Dunster had called on Mr. Wilkins in the\nevening, as Ellinor knew; but she was not quite aware of the reason for\nsuch late visits, and had never put together the two facts--(as cause and\nconsequence)--that on such occasions her father had been absent from the\noffice all day, and that there might be necessary business for him to\ntransact, the urgency of which was the motive for Mr. Dunster's visits.\nMr. Wilkins always seemed to be annoyed by his coming at so late an hour,\nand spoke of it, resenting the intrusion upon his leisure; and Ellinor,\nwithout consideration, adopted her father's mode of speaking and thinking\non the subject, and was rather more angry than he was whenever the\nobnoxious partner came on business in the evening.  This night was, of\nall nights, the most ill-purposed time (so Ellinor thought) for a _tete-a-\ntete_ with her father!  However, there was no doubt in her mind as to\nwhat she had to do.  So late as it was, the unwelcome visitor could not\nstop long; and then she would go down and have her little confidence with\nher father, and beg him to see Mr. Livingstone when he came next morning,\nand dismiss him as gently as might be.\n\nShe sat on in the window-seat; dreaming waking dreams of future\nhappiness.  She kept losing herself in such thoughts, and became almost\nafraid of forgetting why she sat there.  Presently she felt cold, and got\nup to fetch a shawl, in which she muffled herself and resumed her place.\nIt seemed to her growing very late; the moonlight was coming fuller and\nfuller into the garden and the blackness of the shadow was more\nconcentrated and stronger.  Surely Mr. Dunster could not have gone away\nalong the dark shrubbery-path so noiselessly but what she must have heard\nhim?  No! there was the swell of voices coming up through the window from\nher father's study: angry voices they were; and her anger rose\nsympathetically, as she knew that her father was being irritated.  There\nwas a sudden movement, as of chairs pushed hastily aside, and then a\nmysterious unaccountable noise--heavy, sudden; and then a slight movement\nas of chairs again; and then a profound stillness.  Ellinor leaned her\nhead against the side of the window to listen more intently, for some\nmysterious instinct made her sick and faint.  No sound--no noise.  Only\nby-and-by she heard, what we have all heard at such times of intent\nlistening, the beating of the pulses of her heart, and then the whirling\nrush of blood through her head.  How long did this last?  She never knew.\nBy-and-by she heard her father's hurried footstep in his bedroom, next to\nhers; but when she ran thither to speak to him, and ask him what was\namiss--if anything had been--if she might come to him now about Mr.\nLivingstone's letter, she found that he had gone down again to his study,\nand almost at the same moment she heard the little private outer door of\nthat room open; some one went out, and then there were hurried footsteps\nalong the shrubbery-path.  She thought, of course, that it was Mr.\nDunster leaving the house; and went back for Mr. Livingstone's letter.\nHaving found it, she passed through her father's room to the private\nstaircase, thinking that if she went by the more regular way, she would\nhave run the risk of disturbing Miss Monro, and perhaps of being\nquestioned in the morning.  Even in passing down this remote staircase,\nshe trod softly for fear of being overheard.  When she entered the room,\nthe full light of the candles dazzled her for an instant, coming out of\nthe darkness.  They were flaring wildly in the draught that came in\nthrough the open door, by which the outer air was admitted; for a moment\nthere seemed no one in the room, and then she saw, with strange sick\nhorror, the legs of some one lying on the carpet behind the table.  As if\ncompelled, even while she shrank from doing it, she went round to see who\nit was that lay there, so still and motionless as never to stir at her\nsudden coming.  It was Mr. Dunster; his head propped on chair-cushions,\nhis eyes open, staring, distended.  There was a strong smell of brandy\nand hartshorn in the room; a smell so powerful as not to be neutralized\nby the free current of night air that blew through the two open doors.\nEllinor could not have told whether it was reason or instinct that made\nher act as she did during this awful night.  In thinking of it\nafterwards, with shuddering avoidance of the haunting memory that would\ncome and overshadow her during many, many years of her life, she grew to\nbelieve that the powerful smell of the spilt brandy absolutely\nintoxicated her--an unconscious Rechabite in practice.  But something\ngave her a presence of mind and a courage not her own.  And though she\nlearnt to think afterwards that she had acted unwisely, if not wrongly\nand wickedly, yet she marvelled, in recalling that time, how she could\nhave then behaved as she did.  First of all she lifted herself up from\nher fascinated gaze at the dead man, and went to the staircase door, by\nwhich she had entered the study, and shut it softly.  Then she went\nback--looked again; took the brandy-bottle, and knelt down, and tried to\npour some into the mouth; but this she found she could not do.  Then she\nwetted her handkerchief with the spirit, and moistened the lips; all to\nno purpose; for, as I have said before, the man was dead--killed by\nrupture of a vessel of the brain; how occasioned I must tell by-and-by.\nOf course, all Ellinor's little cares and efforts produced no effect; her\nfather had tried them before--vain endeavours all, to bring back the\nprecious breath of life!  The poor girl could not bear the look of those\nopen eyes, and softly, tenderly, tried to close them, although\nunconscious that in so doing she was rendering the pious offices of some\nbeloved hand to a dead man.  She was sitting by the body on the floor\nwhen she heard steps coming with rushing and yet cautious tread, through\nthe shrubbery; she had no fear, although it might be the tread of robbers\nand murderers.  The awfulness of the hour raised her above common fears;\nthough she did not go through the usual process of reasoning, and by it\nfeel assured that the feet which were coming so softly and swiftly along\nwere the same which she had heard leaving the room in like manner only a\nquarter of an hour before.\n\nHer father entered, and started back, almost upsetting some one behind\nhim by his recoil, on seeing his daughter in her motionless attitude by\nthe dead man.\n\n\"My God, Ellinor! what has brought you here?\" he said, almost fiercely.\n\nBut she answered as one stupefied, \"I don't know.  Is he dead?\"\n\n\"Hush, hush, child; it cannot be helped.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes to the solemn, pitying, awe-stricken face behind her\nfather's--the countenance of Dixon.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" she asked of him.\n\nThe man stepped forwards, respectfully pushing his master on one side as\nhe did so.  He bent down over the corpse, and looked, and listened and\nthen reaching a candle off the table, he signed Mr. Wilkins to close the\ndoor.  And Mr. Wilkins obeyed, and looked with an intensity of eagerness\nalmost amounting to faintness on the experiment, and yet he could not\nhope.  The flame was steady--steady and pitilessly unstirred, even when\nit was adjusted close to mouth and nostril; the head was raised up by one\nof Dixon's stalwart arms, while he held the candle in the other hand.\nEllinor fancied that there was some trembling on Dixon's part, and\ngrasped his wrist tightly in order to give it the requisite motionless\nfirmness.\n\nAll in vain.  The head was placed again on the cushions, the servant rose\nand stood by his master, looked sadly on the dead man, whom, living, none\nof them had liked or cared for, and Ellinor sat on, quiet and tearless,\nas one in a trance.\n\n\"How was it, father?\" at length she asked.\n\nHe would fain have had her ignorant of all, but so questioned by her\nlips, so adjured by her eyes in the very presence of death, he could not\nchoose but speak the truth; he spoke it in convulsive gasps, each\nsentence an effort:\n\n\"He taunted me--he was insolent, beyond my patience--I could not bear it.\nI struck him--I can't tell how it was.  He must have hit his head in\nfalling.  Oh, my God! one little hour a go I was innocent of this man's\nblood!\"  He covered his face with his hands.\n\nEllinor took the candle again; kneeling behind Mr. Dunster's head, she\ntried the futile experiment once more.\n\n\"Could not a doctor do some good?\" she asked of Dixon, in a hopeless\nvoice.\n\n\"No!\" said he, shaking his head, and looking with a sidelong glance at\nhis master, who seemed to shrivel up and to shrink away at the bare\nsuggestion.  \"Doctors can do nought, I'm afeard.  All that a doctor could\ndo, I take it, would be to open a vein, and that I could do along with\nthe best of them, if I had but my fleam here.\"  He fumbled in his pockets\nas he spoke, and, as chance would it, the \"fleam\" (or cattle lancet) was\nsomewhere about his dress.  He drew it out, smoothed and tried it on his\nfinger.  Ellinor tried to bare the arm, but turned sick as she did so.\nHer father started eagerly forwards, and did what was necessary with\nhurried trembling hands.  If they had cared less about the result, they\nmight have been more afraid of the consequences of the operation in the\nhands of one so ignorant as Dixon.  But, vein or artery, it signified\nlittle; no living blood gushed out; only a little watery moisture\nfollowed the cut of the fleam.  They laid him back on his strange sad\ndeath-couch.  Dixon spoke next.\n\n\"Master Ned!\" said he--for he had known Mr. Wilkins in his days of bright\ncareless boyhood, and almost was carried back to them by the sense of\ncharge and protection which the servant's presence of mind and sharpened\nsenses gave him over his master on this dreary night--\"Master Ned! we\nmust do summut.\"\n\nNo one spoke.  What was to be done?\n\n\"Did any folk see him come here?\" Dixon asked, after a time.  Ellinor\nlooked up to hear her father's answer, a wild hope coming into her mind\nthat all might be concealed somehow; she did not know how, nor did she\nthink of any consequences except saving her father from the vague dread,\ntrouble, and punishment that she was aware would await him if all were\nknown.\n\nMr. Wilkins did not seem to hear; in fact, he did not hear anything but\nthe unspoken echo of his own last words, that went booming through his\nheart: \"An hour ago I was innocent of this man's blood!  Only an hour\nago!\"\n\nDixon got up and poured out half a tumblerful of raw spirit from the\nbrandy-bottle that stood on the table.\n\n\"Drink this, Master Ned!\" putting it to his master's lips.  \"Nay\"--to\nEllinor--\"it will do him no harm; only bring back his senses, which, poor\ngentleman, are scared away.  We shall need all our wits.  Now, sir,\nplease answer my question.  Did anyone see Measter Dunster come here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mr. Wilkins, recovering his speech.  \"It all seems\nin a mist.  He offered to walk home with me; I did not want him.  I was\nalmost rude to him to keep him off.  I did not want to talk of business;\nI had taken too much wine to be very clear and some things at the office\nwere not quite in order, and he had found it out.  If anyone heard our\nconversation, they must know I did not want him to come with me.  Oh! why\nwould he come?  He was as obstinate--he would come--and here it has been\nhis death!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, what's done can't be undone, and I'm sure we'd any of us\nbring him back to life if we could, even by cutting off our hands, though\nhe was a mighty plaguey chap while he'd breath in him.  But what I'm\nthinking is this: it'll maybe go awkward with you, sir, if he's found\nhere.  One can't say.  But don't you think, miss, as he's neither kith\nnor kin to miss him, we might just bury him away before morning,\nsomewhere?  There's better nor four hours of dark.  I wish we could put\nhim i' the churchyard, but that can't be; but, to my mind, the sooner we\nset about digging a place for him to lie in, poor fellow, the better\nit'll be for us all in the end.  I can pare a piece of turf up where\nit'll never be missed, and if master'll take one spade, and I another,\nwhy we'll lay him softly down, and cover him up, and no one'll be the\nwiser.\"\n\nThere was no reply from either for a minute or so.  Then Mr. Wilkins\nsaid:\n\n\"If my father could have known of my living to this!  Why, they will try\nme as a criminal; and you, Ellinor?  Dixon, you are right.  We must\nconceal it, or I must cut my throat, for I never could live through it.\nOne minute of passion, and my life blasted!\"\n\n\"Come along, sir,\" said Dixon; \"there's no time to lose.\"  And they went\nout in search of tools; Ellinor following them, shivering all over, but\nbegging that she might be with them, and not have to remain in the study\nwith--\n\nShe would not be bidden into her own room; she dreaded inaction and\nsolitude.  She made herself busy with carrying heavy baskets of turf, and\nstraining her strength to the utmost; fetching all that was wanted, with\nsoft swift steps.\n\nOnce, as she passed near the open study door, she thought that she heard\na rustling, and a flash of hope came across her.  Could he be reviving?\nShe entered, but a moment was enough to undeceive her; it had only been a\nnight rustle among the trees.  Of hope, life, there was none.\n\nThey dug the hole deep and well; working with fierce energy to quench\nthought and remorse.  Once or twice her father asked for brandy, which\nEllinor, reassured by the apparently good effect of the first dose,\nbrought to him without a word; and once at her father's suggestion she\nbrought food, such as she could find in the dining-room without\ndisturbing the household, for Dixon.\n\nWhen all was ready for the reception of the body in its unblessed grave,\nMr. Wilkins bade Ellinor go up to her own room--she had done all she\ncould to help them; the rest must be done by them alone.  She felt that\nit must; and indeed both her nerves and her bodily strength were giving\nway.  She would have kissed her father, as he sat wearily at the head of\nthe grave--Dixon had gone in to make some arrangement for carrying the\ncorpse--but he pushed her away quietly, but resolutely--\n\n\"No, Nelly, you must never kiss me again; I am a murderer.\"\n\n\"But I will, my own darling papa,\" said she, throwing her arms\npassionately round his neck, and covering his face with kisses.  \"I love\nyou, and I don't care what you are, if you were twenty times a murderer,\nwhich you are not; I am sure it was only an accident.\"\n\n\"Go in, my child, go in, and try to get some rest.  But go in, for we\nmust finish as fast as we can.  The moon is down; it will soon be\ndaylight.  What a blessing there are no rooms on one side of the house.\nGo, Nelly.\"  And she went; straining herself up to move noiselessly, with\neyes averted, through the room which she shuddered at as the place of\nhasty and unhallowed death.\n\nOnce in her own room she bolted the door on the inside, and then stole to\nthe window, as if some fascination impelled her to watch all the\nproceedings to the end.  But her aching eyes could hardly penetrate\nthrough the thick darkness, which, at the time of the year of which I am\nspeaking, so closely precedes the dawn.  She could discern the tops of\nthe trees against the sky, and could single out the well-known one, at a\nlittle distance from the stem of which the grave was made, in the very\npiece of turf over which so lately she and Ralph had had their merry\nlittle tea-making; and where her father, as she now remembered, had\nshuddered and shivered, as if the ground on which his seat had then been\nplaced was fateful and ominous to him.\n\nThose below moved softly and quietly in all they did; but every sound had\na significant and terrible interpretation to Ellinor's ears.  Before they\nhad ended, the little birds had begun to pipe out their gay _reveillee_\nto the dawn.  Then doors closed, and all was profoundly still.\n\nEllinor threw herself, in her clothes, on the bed; and was thankful for\nthe intense weary physical pain which took off something of the anguish\nof thought--anguish that she fancied from time to time was leading to\ninsanity.\n\nBy-and-by the morning cold made her instinctively creep between the\nblankets; and, once there, she fell into a dead heavy sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nEllinor was awakened by a rapping at her door: it was her maid.\n\nShe was fully aroused in a moment, for she had fallen asleep with one\nclearly defined plan in her mind, only one, for all thoughts and cares\nhaving no relation to the terrible event were as though they had never\nbeen.  All her purpose was to shield her father from suspicion.  And to\ndo this she must control herself--heart, mind, and body must be ruled to\nthis one end.\n\nSo she said to Mason:\n\n\"Let me lie half an hour longer; and beg Miss Monro not to wait breakfast\nfor me; but in half an hour bring me up a cup of strong tea, for I have a\nbad headache.\"\n\nMason went away.  Ellinor sprang up; rapidly undressed herself, and got\ninto bed again, so that when her maid returned with her breakfast, there\nwas no appearance of the night having been passed in any unusual manner.\n\n\"How ill you do look, miss!\" said Mason.  \"I am sure you had better not\nget up yet.\"\n\nEllinor longed to ask if her father had yet shown himself; but this\nquestion--so natural at any other time--seemed to her so suspicious under\nthe circumstances, that she could not bring her lips to frame it.  At any\nrate, she must get up and struggle to make the day like all other days.\nSo she rose, confessing that she did not feel very well, but trying to\nmake light of it, and when she could think of anything but the one awe,\nto say a trivial sentence or two.  But she could not recollect how she\nbehaved in general, for her life hitherto had been simple, and led\nwithout any consciousness of effect.\n\nBefore she was dressed, a message came up to say that Mr. Livingstone was\nin the drawing-room.\n\nMr. Livingstone!  He belonged to the old life of yesterday!  The billows\nof the night had swept over his mark on the sands of her memory; and it\nwas only by a strong effort that she could remember who he was--what he\nwanted.  She sent Mason down to inquire from the servant who admitted him\nwhom it was that he had asked for.\n\n\"He asked for master first.  But master has not rung for his water yet,\nso James told him he was not up.  Then he took thought for a while, and\nasked could he speak to you, he would wait if you were not at liberty but\nthat he wished particular to see either master, or you.  So James asked\nhim to sit down in the drawing-room, and he would let you know.\"\n\n\"I must go,\" thought Ellinor.  \"I will send him away directly; to come,\nthinking of marriage to a house like this--to-day, too!\"\n\nAnd she went down hastily, and in a hard unsparing mood towards a man,\nwhose affection for her she thought was like a gourd, grown up in a\nnight, and of no account, but as a piece of foolish, boyish excitement.\n\nShe never thought of her own appearance--she had dressed without looking\nin the glass.  Her only object was to dismiss her would-be suitor as\nspeedily as possible.  All feelings of shyness, awkwardness, or maiden\nmodesty, were quenched and overcome.  In she went.\n\nHe was standing by the mantelpiece as she entered.  He made a step or two\nforward to meet her; and then stopped, petrified, as it were, at the\nsight of her hard white face.\n\n\"Miss Wilkins, I am afraid you are ill!  I have come too early.  But I\nhave to leave Hamley in half an hour, and I thought--Oh, Miss Wilkins!\nwhat have I done?\"\n\nFor she sank into the chair nearest to her, as if overcome by his words;\nbut, indeed, it was by the oppression of her own thoughts: she was hardly\nconscious of his presence.\n\nHe came a step or two nearer, as if he longed to take her in his arms and\ncomfort and shelter her; but she stiffened herself and arose, and by an\neffort walked towards the fireplace, and there stood, as if awaiting what\nhe would say next.  But he was overwhelmed by her aspect of illness.  He\nalmost forgot his own wishes, his own suit, in his desire to relieve her\nfrom the pain, physical as he believed it, under which she was suffering.\nIt was she who had to begin the subject.\n\n\"I received your letter yesterday, Mr. Livingstone.  I was anxious to see\nyou to-day, in order that I might prevent you from speaking to my father.\nI do not say anything of the kind of affection you can feel for me--me,\nwhom you have only seen once.  All I shall say is, that the sooner we\nboth forget what I must call folly, the better.\"\n\nShe took the airs of a woman considerably older and more experienced than\nhimself.  He thought her haughty; she was only miserable.\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he, more quietly and with more dignity than was\nlikely from his previous conduct.  \"I will not allow you to characterise\nas folly what might be presumptuous on my part--I had no business to\nexpress myself so soon--but which in its foundation was true and sincere.\nThat I can answer for most solemnly.  It is possible, though it may not\nbe a usual thing, for a man to feel so strongly attracted by the charms\nand qualities of a woman, even at first sight, as to feel sure that she,\nand she alone, can make his happiness.  My folly consisted--there you are\nright--in even dreaming that you could return my feelings in the\nslightest degree, when you had only seen me once: and I am most truly\nashamed of myself.  I cannot tell you how sorry I am, when I see how you\nhave compelled yourself to come and speak to me when you are so ill.\"\n\nShe staggered into a chair, for with all her wish for his speedy\ndismissal, she was obliged to be seated.  His hand was upon the bell.\n\n\"No, don't!\" she said.  \"Wait a minute.\"\n\nHis eyes, bent upon her with a look of deep anxiety, touched her at that\nmoment, and she was on the point of shedding tears; but she checked\nherself, and rose again.\n\n\"I will go,\" said he.  \"It is the kindest thing I can do.  Only, may I\nwrite?  May I venture to write and urge what I have to say more\ncoherently?\"\n\n\"No!\" said she.  \"Don't write.  I have given you my answer.  We are\nnothing, and can be nothing to each other.  I am engaged to be married.  I\nshould not have told you if you had not been so kind.  Thank you.  But go\nnow.\"\n\nThe poor young man's face fell, and he became almost as white as she was\nfor the instant.  After a moment's reflection, he took her hand in his,\nand said:\n\n\"May God bless you, and him too, whoever he be!  But if you want a\nfriend, I may be that friend, may I not? and try to prove that my words\nof regard were true, in a better and higher sense than I used them at\nfirst.\"  And kissing her passive hand, he was gone and she was left\nsitting alone.\n\nBut solitude was not what she could bear.  She went quickly upstairs, and\ntook a strong dose of sal-volatile, even while she heard Miss Monro\ncalling to her.\n\n\"My dear, who was that gentleman that has been closeted with you in the\ndrawing-room all this time?\"\n\nAnd then, without listening to Ellinor's reply, she went on:\n\n\"Mrs. Jackson has been here\" (it was at Mrs. Jackson's house that Mr.\nDunster lodged), \"wanting to know if we could tell her where Mr. Dunster\nwas, for he never came home last night at all.  And you were in the\ndrawing-room with--who did you say he was?--that Mr. Livingstone, who\nmight have come at a better time to bid good-bye; and he had never dined\nhere, had he? so I don't see any reason he had to come calling, and P. P.\nC.-ing, and your papa _not_ up.  So I said to Mrs. Jackson, 'I'll send\nand ask Mr. Wilkins, if you like, but I don't see any use in it, for I\ncan tell you just as well as anybody, that Mr. Dunster is not in this\nhouse, wherever he may be.'  Yet nothing would satisfy her but that some\none must go and waken up your papa, and ask if he could tell where Mr.\nDunster was.\"\n\n\"And did papa?\" inquired Ellinor, her dry throat huskily forming the\ninquiry that seemed to be expected from her.\n\n\"No! to be sure not.  How should Mr. Wilkins know?  As I said to Mrs.\nJackson, 'Mr. Wilkins is not likely to know where Mr. Dunster spends his\ntime when he is not in the office, for they do not move in the same rank\nof life, my good woman; and Mrs. Jackson apologised, but said that\nyesterday they had both been dining at Mr. Hodgson's together, she\nbelieved; and somehow she had got it into her head that Mr. Dunster might\nhave missed his way in coming along Moor Lane, and might have slipped\ninto the canal; so she just thought she would step up and ask Mr. Wilkins\nif they had left Mr. Hodgson's together, or if your papa had driven home.\nI asked her why she had not told me all these particulars before, for I\ncould have asked your papa myself all about when he last saw Mr. Dunster;\nand I went up to ask him a second time, but he did not like it at all,\nfor he was busy dressing, and I had to shout my questions through the\ndoor, and he could not always hear me at first.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Oh! he had walked part of the way with Mr. Dunster, and then cut across\nby the short path through the fields, as far as I could understand him\nthrough the door.  He seemed very much annoyed to hear that Mr. Dunster\nhad not been at home all night; but he said I was to tell Mrs. Jackson\nthat he would go to the office as soon as he had had his breakfast, which\nhe ordered to be sent up directly into his own room, and he had no doubt\nit would all turn out right, but that she had better go home at once.\nAnd, as I told her, she might find Mr. Dunster there by the time she got\nthere.  There, there is your papa going out!  He has not lost any time\nover his breakfast!\"\n\nEllinor had taken up the _Hamley Examiner_, a daily paper, which lay on\nthe table, to hide her face in the first instance; but it served a second\npurpose, as she glanced languidly over the columns of the advertisements.\n\n\"Oh! here are Colonel Macdonald's orchideous plants to be sold.  All the\nstock of hothouse and stove plants at Hartwell Priory.  I must send James\nover to Hartwell to attend the sale.  It is to last for three days.\"\n\n\"But can he be spared for so long?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he had better stay at the little inn there, to be on the spot.\nThree days,\" and as she spoke, she ran out to the gardener, who was\nsweeping up the newly-mown grass in the front of the house.  She gave him\nhasty and unlimited directions, only seeming intent--if any one had been\nsuspiciously watching her words and actions--to hurry him off to the\ndistant village, where the auction was to take place.\n\nWhen he was once gone she breathed more freely.  Now, no one but the\nthree cognisant of the terrible reason of the disturbance of the turf\nunder the trees in a certain spot in the belt round the flower-garden,\nwould be likely to go into the place.  Miss Monro might wander round with\na book in her hand; but she never noticed anything, and was short-sighted\ninto the bargain.  Three days of this moist, warm, growing weather, and\nthe green grass would spring, just as if life--was what it had been\ntwenty-four hours before.\n\nWhen all this was done and said, it seemed as if Ellinor's strength and\nspirit sank down at once.  Her voice became feeble, her aspect wan; and\nalthough she told Miss Monro that nothing was the matter, yet it was\nimpossible for any one who loved her not to perceive that she was far\nfrom well.  The kind governess placed her pupil on the sofa, covered her\nfeet up warmly, darkened the room, and then stole out on tiptoe, fancying\nthat Ellinor would sleep.  Her eyes were, indeed, shut; but try as much\nas she would to be quiet, she was up in less than five minutes after Miss\nMonro had left the room, and walking up and down in all the restless\nagony of body that arises from an overstrained mind.  But soon Miss Monro\nreappeared, bringing with her a dose of soothing medicine of her own\nconcocting, for she was great in domestic quackery.  What the medicine\nwas Ellinor did not care to know; she drank it without any sign of her\nusual merry resistance to physic of Miss Monro's ordering; and as the\nlatter took up a book, and showed a set purpose of remaining with her\npatient, Ellinor was compelled to lie still, and presently fell asleep.\n\nShe awakened late in the afternoon with a start.  Her father was standing\nover her, listening to Miss Monro's account of her indisposition.  She\nonly caught one glimpse of his strangely altered countenance, and hid her\nhead in the cushions--hid it from memory, not from him.  For in an\ninstant she must have conjectured the interpretation he was likely to put\nupon her shrinking action, and she had turned towards him, and had thrown\nher arms round his neck, and was kissing his cold, passive face.  Then\nshe fell back.  But all this time their sad eyes never met--they dreaded\nthe look of recollection that must be in each other's gaze.\n\n\"There, my dear!\" said Miss Monro.  \"Now you must lie still till I fetch\nyou a little broth.  You are better now, are not you?\"\n\n\"You need not go for the broth, Miss Monro,\" said Mr. Wilkins, ringing\nthe bell.  \"Fletcher can surely bring it.\"  He dreaded the being left\nalone with his daughter--nor did she fear it less.  She heard the strange\nalteration in her father's voice, hard and hoarse, as if it was an effort\nto speak.  The physical signs of his suffering cut her to the heart; and\nyet she wondered how it was that they could both be alive, or, if alive,\nthey were not rending their garments and crying aloud.  Mr. Wilkins\nseemed to have lost the power of careless action and speech, it is true.\nHe wished to leave the room now his anxiety about his daughter was\nrelieved, but hardly knew how to set about it.  He was obliged to think\nabout the veriest trifle, in order that by an effort of reason he might\nunderstand how he should have spoken or acted if he had been free from\nblood-guiltiness.  Ellinor understood all by intuition.  But henceforward\nthe unspoken comprehension of each other's hidden motions made their\nmutual presence a burdensome anxiety to each.  Miss Monro was a relief;\nthey were glad of her as a third person, unconscious of the secret which\nconstrained them.  This afternoon her unconsciousness gave present pain,\nalthough on after reflection each found in her speeches a cause of\nrejoicing.\n\n\"And Mr. Dunster, Mr. Wilkins, has he come home yet?\"\n\nA moment's pause, in which Mr. Wilkins pumped the words out of his husky\nthroat:\n\n\"I have not heard.  I have been riding.  I went on business to Mr.\nEstcourt's.  Perhaps you will be so kind as to send and inquire at Mrs.\nJackson's.\"\n\nEllinor sickened at the words.  She had been all her life a truthful\nplain-spoken girl.  She held herself high above deceit.  Yet, here came\nthe necessity for deceit--a snare spread around her.  She had not\nrevolted so much from the deed which brought unpremeditated death, as she\ndid from these words of her father's.  The night before, in her mad fever\nof affright, she had fancied that to conceal the body was all that would\nbe required; she had not looked forward to the long, weary course of\nsmall lies, to be done and said, involved in that one mistaken action.\nYet, while her father's words made her soul revolt, his appearance melted\nher heart, as she caught it, half turned away from her, neither looking\nstraight at Miss Monro, nor at anything materially visible.  His hollow\nsunken eye seemed to Ellinor to have a vision of the dead man before it.\nHis cheek was livid and worn, and its healthy colouring gained by years\nof hearty out-door exercise, was all gone into the wanness of age.  His\nhair, even to Ellinor, seemed greyer for the past night of wretchedness.\nHe stooped, and looked dreamily earthward, where formerly he had stood\nerect.  It needed all the pity called forth by such observation to quench\nEllinor's passionate contempt for the course on which she and her father\nwere embarked, when she heard him repeat his words to the servant who\ncame with her broth.\n\n\"Fletcher! go to Mrs. Jackson's and inquire if Mr. Dunster is come home\nyet.  I want to speak to him.\"\n\n\"To him!\" lying dead where he had been laid; killed by the man who now\nasked for his presence.  Ellinor shut her eyes, and lay back in despair.\nShe wished she might die, and be out of this horrible tangle of events.\n\nTwo minutes after, she was conscious of her father and Miss Monro\nstealing softly out of the room.  They thought that she slept.\n\nShe sprang off the sofa and knelt down.\n\n\"Oh, God,\" she prayed, \"Thou knowest!  Help me!  There is none other help\nbut Thee!\"\n\nI suppose she fainted.  For, an hour or more afterwards Miss Monro,\ncoming in, found her lying insensible by the side of the sofa.\n\nShe was carried to bed.  She was not delirious, she was only in a stupor,\nwhich they feared might end in delirium.  To obviate this, her father\nsent far and wide for skilful physicians, who tended her, almost at the\nrate of a guinea the minute.\n\nPeople said how hard it was upon Mr. Wilkins, that scarcely had that\nwretch Dunster gone off, with no one knows how much out of the trusts of\nthe firm, before his only child fell ill.  And, to tell the truth, he\nhimself looked burnt and scared with affliction.  He had a startled look,\nthey said, as if he never could tell, after such experience, from which\nside the awful proofs of the uncertainty of earth would appear, the\nterrible phantoms of unforeseen dread.  Both rich and poor, town and\ncountry, sympathised with him.  The rich cared not to press their claims,\nor their business, at such a time; and only wondered, in their\nsuperficial talk after dinner, how such a good fellow as Wilkins could\never have been deceived by a man like Dunster.  Even Sir Frank Holster\nand his lady forgot their old quarrel, and came to inquire after Ellinor,\nand sent her hothouse fruit by the bushel.\n\nMr. Corbet behaved as an anxious lover should do.  He wrote daily to Miss\nMonro to beg for the most minute bulletins; he procured everything in\ntown that any doctor even fancied might be of service, he came down as\nsoon as there was the slightest hint of permission that Ellinor might see\nhim.  He overpowered her with tender words and caresses, till at last she\nshrank away from them, as from something too bewildering, and past all\nright comprehension.\n\nBut one night before this, when all windows and doors stood open to admit\nthe least breath that stirred the sultry July air, a servant on velvet\ntiptoe had stolen up to Ellinor's open door, and had beckoned out of the\nchamber of the sleeper the ever watchful nurse, Miss Monro.\n\n\"A gentleman wants you,\" were all the words the housemaid dared to say so\nclose to the bedroom.  And softly, softly Miss Monro stepped down the\nstairs, into the drawing-room; and there she saw Mr. Livingstone.  But\nshe did not know him; she had never seen him before.\n\n\"I have travelled all day.  I heard she was ill--was dying.  May I just\nhave one more look at her?  I will not speak; I will hardly breathe.  Only\nlet me see her once again!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, but I don't know who you are; and if you mean\nMiss Wilkins, by 'her,' she is very ill, but we hope not dying.  She was\nvery ill, indeed, yesterday; very dangerously ill, I may say, but she is\nhaving a good sleep, in consequence of a soporific medicine, and we are\nreally beginning to hope--\"\n\nBut just here Miss Monro's hand was taken, and, to her infinite surprise,\nwas kissed before she could remember how improper such behaviour was.\n\n\"God bless you, madam, for saying so.  But if she sleeps, will you let me\nsee her? it can do no harm, for I will tread as if on egg shells; and I\nhave come so far--if I might just look on her sweet face.  Pray, madam,\nlet me just have one sight of her.  I will not ask for more.\"\n\nBut he did ask for more after he had had his wish.  He stole upstairs\nafter Miss Monro, who looked round reproachfully at him if even a\nnightingale sang, or an owl hooted in the trees outside the open windows,\nyet who paused to say herself, outside Mr. Wilkins's chamber door,\n\n\"Her father's room; he has not been in bed for six nights, till to-night;\npray do not make a noise to waken him.\"  And on into the deep stillness\nof the hushed room, where one clear ray of hidden lamp-light shot athwart\nthe door, where a watcher, breathing softly, sat beside the bed--where\nEllinor's dark head lay motionless on the white pillow, her face almost\nas white, her form almost as still.  You might have heard a pin fall.\nAfter a while he moved to withdraw.  Miss Monro, jealous of every sound,\nfollowed him, with steps all the more heavy because they were taken with\nso much care, down the stairs, back into the drawing-room.  By the bed-\ncandle flaring in the draught, she saw that there was the glittering mark\nof wet tears on his cheek; and she felt, as she said afterwards, \"sorry\nfor the young man.\"  And yet she urged him to go, for she knew that she\nmight be wanted upstairs.  He took her hand, and wrung it hard.\n\n\"Thank you.  She looked so changed--oh! she looked as though she were\ndead.  You will write--Herbert Livingstone, Langham Vicarage, Yorkshire;\nyou will promise me to write.  If I could do anything for her, but I can\nbut pray.  Oh, my darling; my darling! and I have no right to be with\nher.\"\n\n\"Go away, there's a good young man,\" said Miss Monro, all the more\npressing to hurry him out by the front door, because she was afraid of\nhis emotion overmastering him, and making him noisy in his\ndemonstrations.  \"Yes, I will write; I will write, never fear!\" and she\nbolted the door behind him, and was thankful.\n\nTwo minutes afterwards there was a low tap; she undid the fastenings, and\nthere he stood, pale in the moonlight.\n\n\"Please don't tell her I came to ask about her; she might not like it.\"\n\n\"No, no! not I!  Poor creature, she's not likely to care to hear anything\nthis long while.  She never roused at Mr. Corbet's name.\"\n\n\"Mr. Corbet's!\" said Livingstone, below his breath, and he turned and\nwent away; this time for good.\n\nBut Ellinor recovered.  She knew she was recovering, when day after day\nshe felt involuntary strength and appetite return.  Her body seemed\nstronger than her will; for that would have induced her to creep into her\ngrave, and shut her eyes for ever on this world, so full of troubles.\n\nShe lay, for the most part, with her eyes closed, very still and quiet;\nbut she thought with the intensity of one who seeks for lost peace, and\ncannot find it.  She began to see that if in the mad impulses of that mad\nnightmare of horror, they had all strengthened each other, and dared to\nbe frank and open, confessing a great fault, a greater disaster, a\ngreater woe--which in the first instance was hardly a crime--their future\ncourse, though sad and sorrowful, would have been a simple and\nstraightforward one to tread.  But it was not for her to undo what was\ndone, and to reveal the error and shame of a father.  Only she, turning\nanew to God, in the solemn and quiet watches of the night, made a\ncovenant, that in her conduct, her own personal individual life, she\nwould act loyally and truthfully.  And as for the future, and all the\nterrible chances involved in it, she would leave it in His hands--if,\nindeed (and here came in the Tempter), He would watch over one whose life\nhereafter must seem based upon a lie.  Her only plea, offered \"standing\nafar off\" was, \"The lie is said and done and over--it was not for my own\nsake.  Can filial piety be so overcome by the rights of justice and\ntruth, as to demand of me that I should reveal my father's guilt.\"\n\nHer father's severe sharp punishment began.  He knew why she suffered,\nwhat made her young strength falter and tremble, what made her life seem\nnigh about to be quenched in death.  Yet he could not take his sorrow and\ncare in the natural manner.  He was obliged to think how every word and\ndeed would be construed.  He fancied that people were watching him with\nsuspicious eyes, when nothing was further from their thoughts.  For once\nlet the \"public\" of any place be possessed by an idea, it is more\ndifficult to dislodge it than any one imagines who has not tried.  If Mr.\nWilkins had gone into Hamley market-place, and proclaimed himself guilty\nof the manslaughter of Mr. Dunster--nay, if he had detailed all the\ncircumstances--the people would have exclaimed, \"Poor man, he is crazed\nby this discovery of the unworthiness of the man he trusted so; and no\nwonder--it was such a thing to have done--to have defrauded his partner\nto such an extent, and then have made off to America!\"\n\nFor many small circumstances, which I do not stop to detail here, went\nfar to prove this, as we know, unfounded supposition; and Mr. Wilkins,\nwho was known, from his handsome boyhood, through his comely manhood, up\nto the present time, by all the people in Hamley, was an object of\nsympathy and respect to every one who saw him, as he passed by, old, and\nlorn, and haggard before his time, all through the evil conduct of one,\nLondon-bred, who was as a hard, unlovely stranger to the popular mind of\nthis little country town.\n\nMr. Wilkins's own servants liked him.  The workings of his temptations\nwere such as they could understand.  If he had been hot-tempered he had\nalso been generous, or I should rather say careless and lavish with his\nmoney.  And now that he was cheated and impoverished by his partner's\ndelinquency, they thought it no wonder that he drank long and deep in the\nsolitary evenings which he passed at home.  It was not that he was\nwithout invitations.  Every one came forward to testify their respect for\nhim by asking him to their houses.  He had probably never been so\nuniversally popular since his father's death.  But, as he said, he did\nnot care to go into society while his daughter was so ill--he had no\nspirits for company.\n\nBut if any one had cared to observe his conduct at home, and to draw\nconclusions from it, they could have noticed that, anxious as he was\nabout Ellinor, he rather avoided than sought her presence, now that her\nconsciousness and memory were restored.  Nor did she ask for, or wish for\nhim.  The presence of each was a burden to the other.  Oh, sad and woeful\nnight of May--overshadowing the coming summer months with gloom and\nbitter remorse!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nStill youth prevailed over all.  Ellinor got well, as I have said, even\nwhen she would fain have died.  And the afternoon came when she left her\nroom.  Miss Monro would gladly have made a festival of her recovery, and\nhave had her conveyed into the unused drawing-room.  But Ellinor begged\nthat she might be taken into the library--into the schoolroom--anywhere\n(thought she) not looking on the side of the house on the flower-garden,\nwhich she had felt in all her illness as a ghastly pressure lying within\nsight of those very windows, through which the morning sun streamed right\nupon her bed--like the accusing angel, bringing all hidden things to\nlight.\n\nAnd when Ellinor was better still, when the Bath-chair had been sent up\nfor her use, by some kindly old maid, out of Hamley, she still petitioned\nthat it might be kept on the lawn or town side of the house, away from\nthe flower-garden.\n\nOne day she almost screamed, when, as she was going to the front door,\nshe saw Dixon standing ready to draw her, instead of Fletcher the servant\nwho usually went.  But she checked all demonstration of feeling; although\nit was the first time she had seen him since he and she and one more had\nworked their hearts out in hard bodily labour.\n\nHe looked so stern and ill!  Cross, too, which she had never seen him\nbefore.\n\nAs soon as they were out of immediate sight of the windows, she asked him\nto stop, forcing herself to speak to him.\n\n\"Dixon, you look very poorly,\" she said, trembling as she spoke.\n\n\"Ay!\" said he.  \"We didn't think much of it at the time, did we, Miss\nNelly?  But it'll be the death on us, I'm thinking.  It has aged me above\na bit.  All my fifty years afore were but as a forenoon of child's play\nto that night.  Measter, too--I could a-bear a good deal, but measter\ncuts through the stable-yard, and past me, wi'out a word, as if I was\npoison, or a stinking foumart.  It's that as is worst, Miss Nelly, it\nis.\"\n\nAnd the poor man brushed some tears from his eyes with the back of his\nwithered, furrowed hand.  Ellinor caught the infection, and cried\noutright, sobbed like a child, even while she held out her little white\nthin hand to his grasp.  For as soon as he saw her emotion, he was\npenitent for what he had said.\n\n\"Don't now--don't,\" was all he could think of to say.\n\n\"Dixon!\" said she at length, \"you must not mind it.  You must try not to\nmind it.  I see he does not like to be reminded of that, even by seeing\nme.  He tries never to be alone with me.  My poor old Dixon, it has\nspoilt my life for me; for I don't think he loves me any more.\"\n\nShe sobbed as if her heart would break; and now it was Dixon's turn to be\ncomforter.\n\n\"Ah, dear, my blessing, he loves you above everything.  It's only he\ncan't a-bear the sight of us, as is but natural.  And if he doesn't fancy\nbeing alone with you, there's always one as does, and that's a comfort at\nthe worst of times.  And don't ye fret about what I said a minute ago.  I\nwere put out because measter all but pushed me out of his way this\nmorning, without never a word.  But I were an old fool for telling ye.\nAnd I've really forgotten why I told Fletcher I'd drag ye a bit about to-\nday.  Th' gardener is beginning for to wonder as you don't want to see\nth' annuals and bedding-out things as you were so particular about in\nMay.  And I thought I'd just have a word wi' ye, and then if you'd let\nme, we'd go together just once round the flower-garden, just to say\nyou've been, you know, and to give them chaps a bit of praise.  You'll\nonly have to look on the beds, my pretty, and it must be done some time.\nSo come along!\"\n\nHe began to pull resolutely in the direction of the flower-garden.\nEllinor bit her lips to keep in the cry of repugnance that rose to them.\nAs Dixon stopped to unlock the door, he said:\n\n\"It's not hardness, nothing like it; I've waited till I heerd you were\nbetter; but it's in for a penny in for a pound wi' us all; and folk may\ntalk; and bless your little brave heart, you'll stand a deal for your\nfather's sake, and so will I, though I do feel it above a bit, when he\nputs out his hand as if to keep me off, and I only going to speak to him\nabout Clipper's knees; though I'll own I had wondered many a day when I\nwas to have the good-morrow master never missed sin' he were a boy\ntill--Well! and now you've seen the beds, and can say they looked mighty\npretty, and is done all as you wished; and we're got out again, and\nbreathing fresher air than yon sunbaked hole, with its smelling flowers,\nnot half so wholesome to snuff at as good stable-dung.\"\n\nSo the good man chatted on; not without the purpose of giving Ellinor\ntime to recover herself; and partly also to drown his own cares, which\nlay heavier on his heart than he could say.  But he thought himself\nrewarded by Ellinor's thanks, and warm pressure of his hard hand as she\ngot out at the front door, and bade him good-by.\n\nThe break to her days of weary monotony was the letters she constantly\nreceived from Mr. Corbet.  And yet here again lurked the sting.  He was\nall astonishment and indignation at Mr. Dunster's disappearance, or\nrather flight, to America.  And now that she was growing stronger, he did\nnot scruple to express curiosity respecting the details, never doubting\nbut that she was perfectly acquainted with much that he wanted to know;\nalthough he had too much delicacy to question her on the point which was\nmost important of all in his eyes, namely, how far it had affected Mr.\nWilkins's worldly prospects; for the report prevalent in Hamley had\nreached London, that Mr. Dunster had made away with, or carried off,\ntrust property to a considerable extent, for all which Mr. Wilkins would\nof course be liable.\n\nIt was hard work for Ralph Corbet to keep from seeking direct information\non this head from Mr. Ness, or, indeed, from Mr. Wilkins himself.  But he\nrestrained himself, knowing that in August he should be able to make all\nthese inquiries personally.  Before the end of the long vacation he had\nhoped to marry Ellinor: that was the time which had been planned by them\nwhen they had met in the early spring before her illness and all this\nmisfortune happened.  But now, as he wrote to his father, nothing could\nbe definitely arranged until he had paid his visit to Hamley, and seen\nthe state of affairs.\n\nAccordingly one Saturday in August, he came to Ford Bank, this time as a\nvisitor to Ellinor's home, instead of to his old quarters at Mr. Ness's.\n\nThe house was still as if asleep in the full heat of the afternoon sun,\nas Mr. Corbet drove up.  The window-blinds were down; the front door wide\nopen, great stands of heliotrope and roses and geraniums stood just\nwithin the shadow of the hall; but through all the silence his approach\nseemed to excite no commotion.  He thought it strange that he had not\nbeen watched for, that Ellinor did not come running out to meet him, that\nshe allowed Fletcher to come and attend to his luggage, and usher him\ninto the library just like any common visitor, any morning-caller.  He\nstiffened himself up into a moment's indignant coldness of manner.  But\nit vanished in an instant when, on the door being opened, he saw Ellinor\nstanding holding by the table, looking for his appearance with almost\npanting anxiety.  He thought of nothing then but her evident weakness,\nher changed looks, for which no account of her illness had prepared him.\nFor she was deadly white, lips and all; and her dark eyes seemed\nunnaturally enlarged, while the caves in which they were set were\nstrangely deep and hollow.  Her hair, too, had been cut off pretty\nclosely; she did not usually wear a cap, but with some faint idea of\nmaking herself look better in his eye, she had put on one this day, and\nthe effect was that she seemed to be forty years of age; but one instant\nafter he had come in, her pale face was flooded with crimson, and her\neyes were full of tears.  She had hard work to keep herself from going\ninto hysterics, but she instinctively knew how much he would hate a\nscene, and she checked herself in time.\n\n\"Oh,\" she murmured, \"I am so glad to see you; it is such a comfort, such\nan infinite pleasure.\"  And so she went on, cooing out words over him,\nand stroking his hair with her thin fingers; while he rather tried to\navert his eyes, he was so much afraid of betraying how much he thought\nher altered.\n\nBut when she came down, dressed for dinner, this sense of her change was\ndiminished to him.  Her short brown hair had already a little wave, and\nwas ornamented by some black lace; she wore a large black lace shawl--it\nhad been her mother's of old--over some delicate-coloured muslin dress;\nher face was slightly flushed, and had the tints of a wild rose; her lips\nkept pale and trembling with involuntary motion, it is true; and as the\nlovers stood together, hand in hand, by the window, he was aware of a\nlittle convulsive twitching at every noise, even while she seemed gazing\nin tranquil pleasure on the long smooth slope of the newly-mown lawn,\nstretching down to the little brook that prattled merrily over the stones\non its merry course to Hamley town.\n\nHe felt a stronger twitch than ever before; even while his ear, less\ndelicate than hers, could distinguish no peculiar sound.  About two\nminutes after Mr. Wilkins entered the room.  He came up to Mr. Corbet\nwith a warm welcome: some of it real, some of it assumed.  He talked\nvolubly to him, taking little or no notice of Ellinor, who dropped into\nthe background, and sat down on the sofa by Miss Monro; for on this day\nthey were all to dine together.  Ralph Corbet thought that Mr. Wilkins\nwas aged; but no wonder, after all his anxiety of various kinds: Mr.\nDunster's flight and reported defalcations, Ellinor's illness, of the\nseriousness of which her lover was now convinced by her appearance.\n\nHe would fain have spoken more to her during the dinner that ensued, but\nMr. Wilkins absorbed all his attention, talking and questioning on\nsubjects that left the ladies out of the conversation almost perpetually.\nMr. Corbet recognised his host's fine tact, even while his persistence in\ntalking annoyed him.  He was quite sure that Mr. Wilkins was anxious to\nspare his daughter any exertion beyond that--to which, indeed, she seemed\nscarely equal--of sitting at the head of the table.  And the more her\nfather talked--so fine an observer was Mr. Corbet--the more silent and\ndepressed Ellinor appeared.  But by-and-by he accounted for this inverse\nratio of gaiety, as he perceived how quickly Mr. Wilkins had his glass\nreplenished.  And here, again, Mr. Corbet drew his conclusions, from the\nsilent way in which, without a word or a sign from his master, Fletcher\ngave him more wine continually--wine that was drained off at once.\n\n\"Six glasses of sherry before dessert,\" thought Mr. Corbet to himself.\n\"Bad habit--no wonder Ellinor looks grave.\"  And when the gentlemen were\nleft alone, Mr. Wilkins helped himself even still more freely; yet\nwithout the slightest effect on the clearness and brilliancy of his\nconversation.  He had always talked well and racily, that Ralph knew, and\nin this power he now recognised a temptation to which he feared that his\nfuture father-in-law had succumbed.  And yet, while he perceived that\nthis gift led into temptation, he coveted it for himself; for he was\nperfectly aware that this fluency, this happy choice of epithets, was the\none thing he should fail in when he began to enter into the more active\ncareer of his profession.  But after some time spent in listening, and\nadmiring, with this little feeling of envy lurking in the background, Mr.\nCorbet became aware of Mr. Wilkins's increasing confusion of ideas, and\nrather unnatural merriment; and, with a sudden revulsion from admiration\nto disgust, he rose up to go into the library, where Ellinor and Miss\nMonro were sitting.  Mr. Wilkins accompanied him, laughing and talking\nsomewhat loudly.  Was Ellinor aware of her father's state?  Of that Mr.\nCorbet could not be sure.  She looked up with grave sad eyes as they came\ninto the room, but with no apparent sensation of surprise, annoyance, or\nshame.  When her glance met her father's, Mr. Corbet noticed that it\nseemed to sober the latter immediately.  He sat down near the open\nwindow, and did not speak, but sighed heavily from time to time.  Miss\nMonro took up a book, in order to leave the young people to themselves;\nand after a little low murmured conversation, Ellinor went upstairs to\nput on her things for a stroll through the meadows by the river-side.\n\nThey were sometimes sauntering along in the lovely summer twilight, now\nresting on some grassy hedge-row bank, or standing still, looking at the\ngreat barges, with their crimson sails, lazily floating down the river,\nmaking ripples on the glassy opal surface of the water.  They did not\ntalk very much; Ellinor seemed disinclined for the exertion; and her\nlover was thinking over Mr. Wilkins's behaviour, with some surprise and\ndistaste of the habit so evidently growing upon him.\n\nThey came home, looking serious and tired: yet they could not account for\ntheir fatigue by the length of their walk, and Miss Monro, forgetting\nAutolycus's song, kept fidgeting about Ellinor, and wondering how it was\nshe looked so pale, if she had only been as far as the Ash Meadow.  To\nescape from this wonder, Ellinor went early to bed.  Mr. Wilkins was\ngone, no one knew where, and Ralph and Miss Monro were left to a half-\nhour's _tete-a-tete_.  He thought he could easily account for Ellinor's\nlanguor, if, indeed, she had perceived as much as he had done of her\nfather's state, when they had come into the library after dinner.  But\nthere were many details which he was anxious to hear from a comparatively\nindifferent person, and as soon as he could, he passed on from the\nconversation about Ellinor's health, to inquiries as to the whole affair\nof Mr. Dunster's disappearance.\n\nNext to her anxiety about Ellinor, Miss Monro liked to dilate on the\nmystery connected with Mr. Dunster's flight; for that was the word she\nemployed without hesitation, as she gave him the account of the event\nuniversally received and believed in by the people of Hamley.  How Mr.\nDunster had never been liked by any one; how everybody remembered that he\ncould never look them straight in the face; how he always seemed to be\nhiding something that he did not want to have known; how he had drawn a\nlarge sum (exact quantity unknown) out of the county bank only the day\nbefore he left Hamley, doubtless in preparation for his escape; how some\none had told Mr. Wilkins he had seen a man just like Dunster lurking\nabout the docks at Liverpool, about two days after he had left his\nlodgings, but that this some one, being in a hurry, had not cared to stop\nand speak to the man; how that the affairs in the office were discovered\nto be in such a sad state that it was no wonder that Mr. Dunster had\nabsconded--he that had been so trusted by poor dear Mr. Wilkins.  Money\ngone no one knew how or where.\n\n\"But has he no friends who can explain his proceedings, and account for\nthe missing money, in some way?\" asked Mr. Corbet.\n\n\"No, none.  Mr. Wilkins has written everywhere, right and left, I\nbelieve.  I know he had a letter from Mr. Dunster's nearest relation--a\ntradesman in the City--a cousin, I think, and he could give no\ninformation in any way.  He knew that about ten years ago Mr. Dunster had\nhad a great fancy for going to America, and had read a great many\ntravels--all just what a man would do before going off to a country.\"\n\n\"Ten years is a long time beforehand,\" said Mr. Corbet, half smiling;\n\"shows malice prepense with a vengeance.\"  But then, turning grave, he\nsaid: \"Did he leave Hamley in debt?\"\n\n\"No; I never heard of that,\" said Miss Monro, rather unwillingly, for she\nconsidered it as a piece of loyalty to the Wilkinses, whom Mr. Dunster\nhad injured (as she thought) to blacken his character as much as was\nconsistent with any degree of truth.\n\n\"It is a strange story,\" said Mr. Corbet, musing.\n\n\"Not at all,\" she replied, quickly; \"I am sure, if you had seen the man,\nwith one or two side-locks of hair combed over his baldness, as if he\nwere ashamed of it, and his eyes that never looked at you, and his way of\neating with his knife when he thought he was not observed--oh, and\nnumbers of things!--you would not think it strange.\"\n\nMr. Corbet smiled.\n\n\"I only meant that he seems to have had no extravagant or vicious habits\nwhich would account for his embezzlement of the money that is\nmissing--but, to be sure, money in itself is a temptation--only he, being\na partner, was in a fair way of making it without risk to himself.  Has\nMr. Wilkins taken any steps to have him arrested in America?  He might\neasily do that.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear Mr. Ralph, you don't know our good Mr. Wilkins!  He would\nrather bear the loss, I am sure, and all this trouble and care which it\nhas brought upon him, than be revenged upon Mr. Dunster.\"\n\n\"Revenged!  What nonsense!  It is simple justice--justice to himself and\nto others--to see that villainy is so sufficiently punished as to deter\nothers from entering upon such courses.  But I have little doubt Mr.\nWilkins has taken the right steps; he is not the man to sit down quietly\nunder such a loss.\"\n\n\"No, indeed! he had him advertised in the _Times_ and in the county\npapers, and offered a reward of twenty pounds for information concerning\nhim.\"\n\n\"Twenty pounds was too little.\"\n\n\"So I said.  I told Ellinor that I would give twenty pounds myself to\nhave him apprehended, and she, poor darling! fell a-trembling, and said,\n'I would give all I have--I would give my life.'  And then she was in\nsuch distress, and sobbed so, I promised her I would never name it to her\nagain.\"\n\n\"Poor child--poor child! she wants change of scene.  Her nerves have been\nsadly shaken by her illness.\"\n\nThe next day was Sunday; Ellinor was to go to church for the first time\nsince her illness.  Her father had decided it for her, or else she would\nfain have stayed away--she would hardly acknowledge why, even to herself,\nbut it seemed to her as if the very words and presence of God must there\nsearch her and find her out.\n\nShe went early, leaning on the arm of her lover, and trying to forget the\npast in the present.  They walked slowly along between the rows of waving\ngolden corn ripe for the harvest.  Mr. Corbet gathered blue and scarlet\nflowers, and made up a little rustic nosegay for her.  She took and stuck\nit in her girdle, smiling faintly as she did so.\n\nHamley Church had, in former days, been collegiate, and was, in\nconsequence, much larger and grander than the majority of country-town\nchurches.  The Ford Bank pew was a square one, downstairs; the Ford Bank\nservants sat in a front pew in the gallery, right before their master.\nEllinor was \"hardening her heart\" not to listen, not to hearken to what\nmight disturb the wound which was just being skinned over, when she\ncaught Dixon's face up above.  He looked worn, sad, soured, and anxious\nto a miserable degree; but he was straining eyes and ears, heart and\nsoul, to hear the solemn words read from the pulpit, as if in them alone\nhe could find help in his strait.  Ellinor felt rebuked and humbled.\n\nShe was in a tumultuous state of mind when they left church; she wished\nto do her duty, yet could not ascertain what it was.  Who was to help her\nwith wisdom and advice?  Assuredly he to whom her future life was to be\ntrusted.  But the case must be stated in an impersonal form.  No one, not\neven her husband, must ever know anything against her father from her.\nEllinor was so artless herself, that she had little idea how quickly and\neasily some people can penetrate motives, and combine disjointed\nsentences.  She began to speak to Ralph on their slow, sauntering walk\nhomewards through the quiet meadows:\n\n\"Suppose, Ralph, that a girl was engaged to be married--\"\n\n\"I can very easily suppose that, with you by me,\" said he, filling up her\npause.\n\n\"Oh! but I don't mean myself at all,\" replied she, reddening.  \"I am only\nthinking of what might happen; and suppose that this girl knew of some\none belonging to her--we will call it a brother--who had done something\nwrong, that would bring disgrace upon the whole family if it was\nknown--though, indeed, it might not have been so very wrong as it seemed,\nand as it would look to the world--ought she to break off her engagement\nfor fear of involving her lover in the disgrace?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, without telling him her reason for doing so.\"\n\n\"Ah! but suppose she could not.  She might not be at liberty to do so.\"\n\n\"I can't answer supposititious cases.  I must have the facts--if facts\nthere are--more plainly before me before I can give an opinion.  Who are\nyou thinking of, Ellinor?\" asked he, rather abruptly.\n\n\"Oh, of no one,\" she answered in affright.  \"Why should I be thinking of\nany one?  I often try to plan out what I should do, or what I ought to\ndo, if such and such a thing happened, just as you recollect I used to\nwonder if I should have presence of mind in case of fire.\"\n\n\"Then, after all, you yourself are the girl who is engaged, and who has\nthe imaginary brother who gets into disgrace?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" said she, a little annoyed at having betrayed any\npersonal interest in the affair.\n\nHe was silent, meditating.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong in it,\" said she, timidly, \"is there?\"\n\n\"I think you had better tell me fully out what is in your mind,\" he\nreplied, kindly.  \"Something has happened which has suggested these\nquestions.  Are you putting yourself in the place of any one about whom\nyou have been hearing lately?  I know you used to do so formerly, when\nyou were a little girl.\"\n\n\"No; it was a very foolish question of mine, and I ought not to have said\nanything about it.  See! here is Mr. Ness overtaking us.\"\n\nThe clergyman joined them on the broad walk that ran by the river-side,\nand the talk became general.  It was a relief to Ellinor, who had not\nattained her end, but who had gone far towards betraying something of her\nown individual interest in the question she had asked.  Ralph had been\nmore struck even by her manner than her words.  He was sure that\nsomething lurked behind, and had an idea of his own that it was connected\nwith Dunster's disappearance.  But he was glad that Mr. Ness's joining\nthem gave him leisure to consider a little.\n\nThe end of his reflections was, that the next day, Monday, he went into\nthe town, and artfully learnt all he could hear about Mr Dunster's\ncharacter and mode of going on; and with still more skill he extracted\nthe popular opinion as to the embarrassed nature of Mr. Wilkins's\naffairs--embarrassment which was generally attributed to Dunster's\ndisappearance with a good large sum belonging to the firm in his\npossession.  But Mr. Corbet thought otherwise; he had accustomed himself\nto seek out the baser motives for men's conduct, and to call the result\nof these researches wisdom.  He imagined that Dunster had been well paid\nby Mr. Wilkins for his disappearance, which was an easy way of accounting\nfor the derangement of accounts and loss of money that arose, in fact,\nfrom Mr. Wilkins's extravagance of habits and growing intemperance.\n\nOn the Monday afternoon he said to Ellinor, \"Mr. Ness interrupted us\nyesterday in a very interesting conversation.  Do you remember, love?\"\n\nEllinor reddened and kept her head still more intently bent over a sketch\nshe was making.\n\n\"Yes; I recollect.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking about it.  I still think she ought to tell her\nlover that such disgrace hung over him--I mean, over the family with whom\nhe was going to connect himself.  Of course, the only effect would be to\nmake him stand by her still more for her frankness.\"\n\n\"Oh! but, Ralph, it might perhaps be something she ought not to tell,\nwhatever came of her silence.\"\n\n\"Of course there might be all sorts of cases.  Unless I knew more I could\nnot pretend to judge.\"\n\nThis was said rather more coolly.  It had the desired effect.  Ellinor\nlaid down her brush, and covered her face with her hand.  After a pause,\nshe turned towards him and said:\n\n\"I will tell you this; and more you must not ask me.  I know you are as\nsafe as can be.  I am the girl, you are the lover, and possible shame\nhangs over my father, if something--oh, so dreadful\" (here she blanched),\n\"but not so very much his fault, is ever found out.\"\n\nThough this was nothing more than he expected, though Ralph thought that\nhe was aware what the dreadful something might be, yet, when it was\nacknowledged in words, his heart contracted, and for a moment he forgot\nthe intent, wistful, beautiful face, creeping close to his to read his\nexpression aright.  But after that his presence of mind came in aid.  He\ntook her in his arms and kissed her; murmuring fond words of sympathy,\nand promises of faith, nay, even of greater love than before, since\ngreater need she might have of that love.  But somehow he was glad when\nthe dressing-bell rang, and in the solitude of his own room he could\nreflect on what he had heard; for the intelligence had been a great shock\nto him, although he had fancied that his morning's inquiries had prepared\nhim for it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nRalph Corbet found it a very difficult thing to keep down his curiosity\nduring the next few days.  It was a miserable thing to have Ellinor's\nunspoken secret severing them like a phantom.  But he had given her his\nword that he would make no further inquiries from her.  Indeed, he\nthought he could well enough make out the outline of past events; still,\nthere was too much left to conjecture for his mind not to be always busy\non the subject.  He felt inclined to probe Mr. Wilkins in their after-\ndinner conversation, in which his host was frank and lax enough on many\nsubjects.  But once touch on the name of Dunster and Mr. Wilkins sank\ninto a kind of suspicious depression of spirits; talking little, and with\nevident caution; and from time to time shooting furtive glances at his\ninterlocutor's face.  Ellinor was resolutely impervious to any attempts\nof his to bring his conversation with her back to the subject which more\nand more engrossed Ralph Corbet's mind.  She had done her duty, as she\nunderstood it; and had received assurances which she was only too glad to\nbelieve fondly with all the tender faith of her heart.  Whatever came to\npass, Ralph's love would still be hers; nor was he unwarned of what might\ncome to pass in some dread future day.  So she shut her eyes to what\nmight be in store for her (and, after all, the chances were immeasurably\nin her favour); and she bent herself with her whole strength into\nenjoying the present.  Day by day Mr. Corbet's spirits flagged.  He was,\nhowever, so generally uniform in the tenor of his talk--never very merry,\nand always avoiding any subject that might call out deep feeling either\non his own or any one else's part, that few people were aware of his\nchanges of mood.  Ellinor felt them, though she would not acknowledge\nthem: it was bringing her too much face to face with the great terror of\nher life.\n\nOne morning he announced the fact of his brother's approaching marriage;\nthe wedding was hastened on account of some impending event in the duke's\nfamily; and the home letter he had received that day was to bid his\npresence at Stokely Castle, and also to desire him to be at home by a\ncertain time not very distant, in order to look over the requisite legal\npapers, and to give his assent to some of them.  He gave many reasons why\nthis unlooked-for departure of his was absolutely necessary; but no one\ndoubted it.  He need not have alleged such reiterated excuses.  The truth\nwas, he was restrained and uncomfortable at Ford Bank ever since\nEllinor's confidence.  He could not rightly calculate on the most\ndesirable course for his own interests, while his love for her was\nconstantly being renewed by her sweet presence.  Away from her, he could\njudge more wisely.  Nor did he allege any false reasons for his\ndeparture; but the sense of relief to himself was so great at his recall\nhome, that he was afraid of having it perceived by others; and so took\nthe very way which, if others had been as penetrating as himself, would\nhave betrayed him.\n\nMr. Wilkins, too, had begun to feel the restraint of Ralph's grave\nwatchful presence.  Ellinor was not strong enough to be married; nor was\nthe promised money forthcoming if she had been.  And to have a fellow\ndawdling about the house all day, sauntering into the flower-garden,\npeering about everywhere, and having a kind of right to put all manner of\nunexpected questions, was anything but agreeable.  It was only Ellinor\nthat clung to his presence--clung as though some shadow of what might\nhappen before they met again had fallen on her spirit.  As soon as he had\nleft the house she flew up to a spare bedroom window, to watch for the\nlast glimpse of the fly which was taking him into the town.  And then she\nkissed the part of the pane on which his figure, waving an arm out of the\ncarriage window, had last appeared; and went down slowly to gather\ntogether all the things he had last touched--the pen he had mended, the\nflower he had played with, and to lock them up in the little quaint\ncabinet that had held her treasures since she was a tiny child.\n\nMiss Monro was, perhaps, very wise in proposing the translation of a\ndifficult part of Dante for a distraction to Ellinor.  The girl went\nmeekly, if reluctantly, to the task set her by her good governess, and by-\nand-by her mind became braced by the exertion.\n\nRalph's people were not very slow in discovering that something had not\ngone on quite smoothly with him at Ford Bank.  They knew his ways and\nlooks with family intuition, and could easily be certain thus far.  But\nnot even his mother's skilfulest wiles, nor his favourite sister's\ncoaxing, could obtain a word or a hint; and when his father, the squire,\nwho had heard the opinions of the female part of the family on this head,\nbegan, in his honest blustering way, in their _tete-a-tetes_ after\ndinner, to hope that Ralph was thinking better than to run his head into\nthat confounded Hamley attorney's noose, Ralph gravely required Mr.\nCorbet to explain his meaning, which he professed not to understand so\nworded.  And when the squire had, with much perplexity, put it into the\nplain terms of hoping that his son was thinking of breaking off his\nengagement to Miss Wilkins, Ralph coolly asked him if he was aware that,\nin that case, he should lose all title to being a man of honour, and\nmight have an action brought against him for breach of promise?\n\nYet not the less for all this was the idea in his mind as a future\npossibility.\n\nBefore very long the Corbet family moved _en masse_ to Stokely Castle for\nthe wedding.  Of course, Ralph associated on equal terms with the\nmagnates of the county, who were the employers of Ellinor's father, and\nspoke of him always as \"Wilkins,\" just as they spoke of the butler as\n\"Simmons.\"  Here, too, among a class of men high above local gossip, and\nthus unaware of his engagement, he learnt the popular opinion respecting\nhis future father-in-law; an opinion not entirely respectful, though\nintermingled with a good deal of personal liking.  \"Poor Wilkins,\" as\nthey called him, \"was sadly extravagant for a man in his position; had no\nright to spend money, and act as if he were a man of independent\nfortune.\"  His habits of life were criticised; and pity, not free from\nblame, was bestowed upon him for the losses he had sustained from his\nlate clerk's disappearance and defalcation.  But what could be expected\nif a man did not choose to attend to his own business?\n\nThe wedding went by, as grand weddings do, without let or hindrance,\naccording to the approved pattern.  A Cabinet minister honoured it with\nhis presence, and, being a distant relation of the Brabants, remained for\na few days after the grand occasion.  During this time he became rather\nintimate with Ralph Corbet; many of their tastes were in common.  Ralph\ntook a great interest in the manner of working out political questions;\nin the balance and state of parties; and had the right appreciation of\nthe exact qualities on which the minister piqued himself.  In return, the\nlatter was always on the look-out for promising young men, who, either by\ntheir capability of speech-making or article-writing, might advance the\nviews of his party.  Recognising the powers he most valued in Ralph, he\nspared no pains to attach him to his own political set.  When they\nseparated, it was with the full understanding that they were to see a\ngood deal of each other in London.\n\nThe holiday Ralph allowed himself was passing rapidly away; but, before\nhe returned to his chambers and his hard work, he had promised to spend a\nfew more days with Ellinor; and it suited him to go straight from the\nduke's to Ford Bank.  He left the castle soon after breakfast--the\nluxurious, elegant breakfast, served by domestics who performed their\nwork with the accuracy and perfection of machines.  He arrived at Ford\nBank before the man-servant had quite finished the dirtier part of his\nmorning's work, and he came to the glass-door in his striped cotton\njacket, a little soiled, and rolling up his working apron.  Ellinor was\nnot yet strong enough to get up and go out and gather flowers for the\nrooms, so those left from yesterday were rather faded; in short, the\ncontrast from entire completeness and exquisite freshness of arrangement\nstruck forcibly upon Ralph's perceptions, which were critical rather than\nappreciative; and, as his affections were always subdued to his\nintellect, Ellinor's lovely face and graceful figure flying to meet him\ndid not gain his full approval, because her hair was dressed in an old-\nfashioned way, her waist was either too long or too short, her sleeves\ntoo full or too tight for the standard of fashion to which his eye had\nbeen accustomed while scanning the bridesmaids and various highborn\nladies at Stokely Castle.\n\nBut, as he had always piqued himself upon being able to put on one side\nall superficial worldliness in his chase after power, it did not do for\nhim to shrink from seeing and facing the incompleteness of moderate\nmeans.  Only marriage upon moderate means was gradually becoming more\ndistasteful to him.\n\nNor did his subsequent intercourse with Lord Bolton, the Cabinet minister\nbefore mentioned, tend to reconcile him to early matrimony.  At Lord\nBolton's house he met polished and intellectual society, and all that\nsmoothness in ministering to the lower wants in eating and drinking which\nseems to provide that the right thing shall always be at the right place\nat the right time, so that the want of it shall never impede for an\ninstant the feast of wit or reason; while, if he went to the houses of\nhis friends, men of the same college and standing as himself, who had\nbeen seduced into early marriages, he was uncomfortably aware of numerous\ninconsistencies and hitches in their _menages_.  Besides, the idea of the\npossible disgrace that might befall the family with which he thought of\nallying himself haunted him with the tenacity and also with the\nexaggeration of a nightmare, whenever he had overworked himself in his\nsearch after available and profitable knowledge, or had a fit of\nindigestion after the exquisite dinners he was learning so well to\nappreciate.\n\nChristmas was, of course, to be devoted to his own family; it was an\nunavoidable necessity, as he told Ellinor, while, in reality, he was\nbeginning to find absence from his betrothed something of a relief.  Yet\nthe wranglings and folly of his home, even blessed by the presence of a\nLady Maria, made him look forward to Easter at Ford Bank with something\nof the old pleasure.\n\nEllinor, with the fine tact which love gives, had discovered his\nannoyance at various little incongruities in the household at the time of\nhis second visit in the previous autumn, and had laboured to make all as\nperfect as she could before his return.  But she had much to struggle\nagainst.  For the first time in her life there was a great want of ready\nmoney; she could scarcely obtain the servants' wages; and the bill for\nthe spring seeds was a heavy weight on her conscience.  For Miss Monro's\nmethodical habits had taught her pupil great exactitude as to all money\nmatters.\n\nThen her father's temper had become very uncertain.  He avoided being\nalone with her whenever he possibly could; and the consciousness of this,\nand of the terrible mutual secret which was the cause of this\nestrangement, were the reasons why Ellinor never recovered her pretty\nyouthful bloom after her illness.  Of course it was to this that the\noutside world attributed her changed appearance.  They would shake their\nheads and say, \"Ah, poor Miss Wilkins!  What a lovely creature she was\nbefore that fever!\"\n\nBut youth is youth, and will assert itself in a certain elasticity of\nbody and spirits; and at times Ellinor forgot that fearful night for\nseveral hours together.  Even when her father's averted eye brought it\nall once more before her, she had learnt to form excuses and palliations,\nand to regard Mr. Dunster's death as only the consequence of an\nunfortunate accident.  But she tried to put the miserable remembrance\nentirely out of her mind; to go on from day to day thinking only of the\nday, and how to arrange it so as to cause the least irritation to her\nfather.  She would so gladly have spoken to him on the one subject which\novershadowed all their intercourse; she fancied that by speaking she\nmight have been able to banish the phantom, or reduce its terror to what\nshe believed to be the due proportion.  But her father was evidently\ndetermined to show that he was never more to be spoken to on that\nsubject; and all she could do was to follow his lead on the rare\noccasions that they fell into something like the old confidential\nintercourse.  As yet, to her, he had never given way to anger; but before\nher he had often spoken in a manner which both pained and terrified her.\nSometimes his eye in the midst of his passion caught on her face of\naffright and dismay, and then he would stop, and make such an effort to\ncontrol himself as sometimes ended in tears.  Ellinor did not understand\nthat both these phases were owing to his increasing habit of drinking\nmore than he ought to have done.  She set them down as the direct effects\nof a sorely burdened conscience; and strove more and more to plan for his\ndaily life at home, how it should go on with oiled wheels, neither a jerk\nnor a jar.  It was no wonder she looked wistful, and careworn, and old.\nMiss Monro was her great comfort; the total unconsciousness on that\nlady's part of anything below the surface, and yet her full and delicate\nrecognition of all the little daily cares and trials, made her sympathy\nmost valuable to Ellinor, while there was no need to fear that it would\never give Miss Monro that power of seeing into the heart of things which\nit frequently confers upon imaginative people, who are deeply attached to\nsome one in sorrow.\n\nThere was a strong bond between Ellinor and Dixon, although they scarcely\never exchanged a word save on the most common-place subjects; but their\nsilence was based on different feelings from that which separated Ellinor\nfrom her father.  Ellinor and Dixon could not speak freely, because their\nhearts were full of pity for the faulty man whom they both loved so well,\nand tried so hard to respect.\n\nThis was the state of the household to which Ralph Corbet came down at\nEaster.  He might have been known in London as a brilliant diner-out by\nthis time; but he could not afford to throw his life away in fireworks;\nhe calculated his forces, and condensed their power as much as might be,\nonly visiting where he was likely to meet men who could help in his\nfuture career.  He had been invited to spend the Easter vacation at a\ncertain country house which would be full of such human stepping-stones;\nand he declined in order to keep his word to Ellinor, and go to Ford\nBank.  But he could not help looking upon himself a little in the light\nof a martyr to duty; and perhaps this view of his own merits made him\nchafe under his future father-in-law's irritability of manner, which now\nshowed itself even to him.  He found himself distinctly regretting that\nhe had suffered himself to be engaged so early in life; and having become\nconscious of the temptation and not having repelled it at once, of course\nit returned and returned, and gradually obtained the mastery over him.\nWhat was to be gained by keeping to his engagement with Ellinor?  He\nshould have a delicate wife to look after, and even more than the common\nadditional expenses of married life.  He should have a father-in-law\nwhose character at best had had only a local and provincial\nrespectability, which it was now daily losing by habits which were both\nsensual and vulgarising; a man, too, who was strangely changing from\njoyous geniality into moody surliness.  Besides, he doubted if, in the\nevident change in the prosperity of the family, the fortune to be paid\ndown on the occasion of his marriage to Ellinor could be forthcoming.  And\nabove all, and around all, there hovered the shadow of some unrevealed\ndisgrace, which might come to light at any time and involve him in it.  He\nthought he had pretty well ascertained the nature of this possible shame,\nand had little doubt it would turn out to be that Dunster's\ndisappearance, to America or elsewhere, had been an arranged plan with\nMr. Wilkins.  Although Mr. Ralph Corbet was capable of suspecting him of\nthis mean crime (so far removed from the impulsive commission of the past\nsin which was dragging him daily lower and lower down), it was of a kind\nthat was peculiarly distasteful to the acute lawyer, who foresaw how such\nbase conduct would taint all whose names were ever mentioned, even by\nchance, in connection with it.  He used to lie miserably tossing on his\nsleepless bed, turning over these things in the night season.  He was\ntormented by all these thoughts; he would bitterly regret the past events\nthat connected him with Ellinor, from the day when he first came to read\nwith Mr. Ness up to the present time.  But when he came down in the\nmorning, and saw the faded Ellinor flash into momentary beauty at his\nentrance into the dining-room, and when she blushingly drew near with the\none single flower freshly gathered, which it had been her custom to place\nin his button-hole when he came down to breakfast, he felt as if his\nbetter self was stronger than temptation, and as if he must be an honest\nman and honourable lover, even against his wish.\n\nAs the day wore on the temptation gathered strength.  Mr. Wilkins came\ndown, and while he was on the scene Ellinor seemed always engrossed by\nher father, who apparently cared little enough for all her attentions.\nThen there was a complaining of the food, which did not suit the sickly\npalate of a man who had drunk hard the night before; and possibly these\ncomplaints were extended to the servants, and their incompleteness or\nincapacity was thus brought prominently before the eyes of Ralph, who\nwould have preferred to eat a dry crust in silence, or to have gone\nwithout breakfast altogether, if he could have had intellectual\nconversation of some high order, to having the greatest dainties with the\nknowledge of the care required in their preparation thus coarsely\ndiscussed before him.  By the time such breakfasts were finished, Ellinor\nlooked thirty, and her spirits were gone for the day.  It had become\ndifficult for Ralph to contract his mind to her small domestic interests,\nand she had little else to talk to him about, now that he responded but\ncurtly to all her questions about himself, and was weary of professing a\nlove which he was ceasing to feel, in all the passionate nothings which\nusually make up so much of lovers' talk.  The books she had been reading\nwere old classics, whose place in literature no longer admitted of keen\ndiscussion; the poor whom she cared for were all very well in their way;\nand, if they could have been brought in to illustrate a theory, hearing\nabout them might have been of some use; but, as it was, it was simply\ntiresome to hear day after day of Betty Palmer's rheumatism and Mrs.\nKay's baby's fits.  There was no talking politics with her, because she\nwas so ignorant that she always agreed with everything he said.\n\nHe even grew to find luncheon and Miss Monro not unpleasant varieties to\nhis monotonous _tete-a-tetes_.  Then came the walk, generally to the town\nto fetch Mr. Wilkins from his office; and once or twice it was pretty\nevident how he had been employing his hours.  One day in particular his\nwalk was so unsteady and his speech so thick, that Ralph could only\nwonder how it was that Ellinor did not perceive the cause; but she was\ntoo openly anxious about the headache of which her father complained to\nhave been at all aware of the previous self-indulgence which must have\nbrought it on.  This very afternoon, as ill-luck would have it, the Duke\nof Hinton and a gentleman whom Ralph had met in town at Lord Bolton's\nrode by, and recognised him; saw Ralph supporting a tipsy man with such\nquiet friendly interest as must show all passers-by that they were\nprevious friends.  Mr. Corbet chafed and fumed inwardly all the way home\nafter this unfortunate occurrence; he was in a thoroughly evil temper\nbefore they reached Ford Bank, but he had too much self-command to let\nthis be very apparent.  He turned into the shrubbery paths, leaving\nEllinor to take her father into the quietness of his own room, there to\nlie down and shake off his headache.\n\nRalph walked along, ruminating in gloomy mood as to what was to be done;\nhow he could best extricate himself from the miserable relation in which\nhe had placed himself by giving way to impulse.  Almost before he was\naware, a little hand stole within his folded arms, and Ellinor's sweet\nsad eyes looked into his.\n\n\"I have put papa down for an hour's rest before dinner,\" said she.  \"His\nhead seems to ache terribly.\"\n\nRalph was silent and unsympathising, trying to nerve himself up to be\ndisagreeable, but finding it difficult in the face of such sweet trust.\n\n\"Do you remember our conversation last autumn, Ellinor?\" he began at\nlength.\n\nHer head sunk.  They were near a garden-seat, and she quietly sat down,\nwithout speaking.\n\n\"About some disgrace which you then fancied hung over you?\"  No answer.\n\"Does it still hang over you?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" she whispered, with a heavy sigh.\n\n\"And your father knows this, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" again, in the same tone; and then silence.\n\n\"I think it is doing him harm,\" at length Ralph went on, decidedly.\n\n\"I am afraid it is,\" she said, in a low tone.\n\n\"I wish you would tell me what it is,\" he said, a little impatiently.  \"I\nmight be able to help you about it.\"\n\n\"No! you could not,\" replied Ellinor.  \"I was sorry to my very heart to\ntell you what I did; I did not want help; all that is past.  But I wanted\nto know if you thought that a person situated as I was, was justified in\nmarrying any one ignorant of what might happen, what I do hope and trust\nnever will.\"\n\n\"But if I don't know what you are alluding to in this mysterious way, you\nmust see--don't you see, love?--I am in the position of the ignorant man\nwhom I think you said you could not feel it right to marry.  Why don't\nyou tell me straight out what it is?\"  He could not help his irritation\nbetraying itself in his tones and manner of speaking.  She bent a little\nforward, and looked full into his face, as though to pierce to the very\nheart's truth of him.  Then she said, as quietly as she had ever spoken\nin her life,--\"You wish to break off our engagement?\"\n\nHe reddened and grew indignant in a moment.  \"What nonsense!  Just\nbecause I ask a question and make a remark!  I think your illness must\nhave made you fanciful, Ellinor.  Surely nothing I said deserves such an\ninterpretation.  On the contrary, have I not shown the sincerity and\ndepth of my affection to you by clinging to you through--through\neverything?\"\n\nHe was going to say \"through the wearying opposition of my family,\" but\nhe stopped short, for he knew that the very fact of his mother's\nopposition had only made him the more determined to have his own way in\nthe first instance; and even now he did not intend to let out, what he\nhad concealed up to this time, that his friends all regretted his\nimprudent engagement.\n\nEllinor sat silently gazing out upon the meadows, but seeing nothing.\nThen she put her hand into his.  \"I quite trust you, Ralph.  I was wrong\nto doubt.  I am afraid I have grown fanciful and silly.\"\n\nHe was rather put to it for the right words, for she had precisely\ndivined the dim thought that had overshadowed his mind when she had\nlooked so intently at him.  But he caressed her, and reassured her with\nfond words, as incoherent as lovers' words generally are.\n\nBy-and-by they sauntered homewards.  When they reached the house, Ellinor\nleft him, and flew up to see how her father was.  When Ralph went into\nhis own room he was vexed with himself, both for what he had said and for\nwhat he had not said.  His mental look-out was not satisfactory.\n\nNeither he nor Mr. Wilkins was in good humour with the world in general\nat dinner-time, and it needs little in such cases to condense and turn\nthe lowering tempers into one particular direction.  As long as Ellinor\nand Miss Monro stayed in the dining-room, a sort of moody peace had been\nkept up, the ladies talking incessantly to each other about the trivial\nnothings of their daily life, with an instinctive consciousness that if\nthey did not chatter on, something would be said by one of the gentlemen\nwhich would be distasteful to the other.\n\nAs soon as Ralph had shut the door behind them, Mr. Wilkins went to the\nsideboard, and took out a bottle which had not previously made its\nappearance.\n\n\"Have a little cognac?\" he asked, with an assumption of carelessness, as\nhe poured out a wine-glassful.  \"It's a capital thing for the headache;\nand this nasty lowering weather has given me a racking headache all day.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for it,\" said Ralph, \"for I wanted particularly to speak to\nyou about business--about my marriage, in fact.\"\n\n\"Well! speak away, I'm as clear-headed as any man, if that's what you\nmean.\"\n\nRalph bowed, a little contemptuously.\n\n\"What I wanted to say was, that I am anxious to have all things arranged\nfor my marriage in August.  Ellinor is so much better now; in fact, so\nstrong, that I think we may reckon upon her standing the change to a\nLondon life pretty well.\"\n\nMr. Wilkins stared at him rather blankly, but did not immediately speak.\n\n\"Of course I may have the deeds drawn up in which, as by previous\narrangement, you advance a certain portion of Ellinor's fortune for the\npurposes therein to be assigned; as we settled last year when I hoped to\nhave been married in August?\"\n\nA thought flitted through Mr. Wilkins's confused brain that he should\nfind it impossible to produce the thousands required without having\nrecourse to the money lenders, who were already making difficulties, and\ncharging him usurious interest for the advances they had lately made; and\nhe unwisely tried to obtain a diminution in the sum he had originally\nproposed to give Ellinor.  \"Unwisely,\" because he might have read Ralph's\ncharacter better than to suppose he would easily consent to any\ndiminution without good and sufficient reason being given; or without\nsome promise of compensating advantages in the future for the present\nsacrifice asked from him.  But perhaps Mr. Wilkins, dulled as he was by\nwine thought he could allege a good and sufficient reason, for he said:\n\n\"You must not be hard upon me, Ralph.  That promise was made\nbefore--before I exactly knew the state of my affairs!\"\n\n\"Before Dunster's disappearance, in fact,\" said Mr. Corbet, fixing his\nsteady, penetrating eyes on Mr. Wilkins's countenance.\n\n\"Yes--exactly--before Dunster's--\" mumbled out Mr. Wilkins, red and\nconfused, and not finishing his sentence.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Ralph (for with careful carelessness of manner he\nthought he could extract something of the real nature of the impending\ndisgrace from his companion, in the state in which he then was; and if he\nonly knew more about this danger he could guard against it; guard others;\nperhaps himself)--\"By the way, have you ever heard anything of Dunster\nsince he went off to--America, isn't it thought?\"\n\nHe was startled beyond his power of self-control by the instantaneous\nchange in Mr. Wilkins which his question produced.  Both started up; Mr.\nWilkins white, shaking, and trying to say something, but unable to form a\nsensible sentence.\n\n\"Good God! sir, what is the matter?\" said Ralph, alarmed at these signs\nof physical suffering.\n\nMr. Wilkins sat down, and repelled his nearer approach without speaking.\n\n\"It is nothing, only this headache which shoots through me at times.\nDon't look at me, sir, in that way.  It is very unpleasant to find\nanother man's eyes perpetually fixed upon you.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Ralph, coldly; his short-lived sympathy, thus\nrepulsed, giving way to his curiosity.  But he waited for a minute or two\nwithout daring to renew the conversation at the point where they had\nstopped: whether interrupted by bodily or mental discomfort on the part\nof his companion he was not quite sure.  While he hesitated how to begin\nagain on the subject, Mr. Wilkins pulled the bottle of brandy to himself\nand filled his glass again, tossing off the spirit as if it had been\nwater.  Then he tried to look Mr. Corbet full in the face, with a stare\nas pertinacious as he could make it, but very different from the keen\nobservant gaze which was trying to read him through.\n\n\"What were we talking about?\" said Ralph, at length, with the most\nnatural air in the world, just as if he had really been forgetful of some\nhalf-discussed subject of interest.\n\n\"Of what you'd a d---d deal better hold your tongue about,\" growled out\nMr. Wilkins, in a surly thick voice.\n\n\"Sir!\" said Ralph, starting to his feet with real passion at being so\naddressed by \"Wilkins the attorney.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the latter, \"I'll manage my own affairs, and allow of no\nmeddling and no questioning.  I said so once before, and I was not minded\nand bad came of it; and now I say it again.  And if you're to come here\nand put impertinent questions, and stare at me as you've been doing this\nhalf-hour past, why, the sooner you leave this house the better!\"\n\nRalph half turned to take him at his word, and go at once; but then he\n\"gave Ellinor another chance,\" as he worded it in his thoughts; but it\nwas in no spirit of conciliation that he said:\n\n\"You've taken too much of that stuff, sir.  You don't know what you're\nsaying.  If you did, I should leave your house at once, never to return.\"\n\n\"You think so, do you?\" said Mr. Wilkins, trying to stand up, and look\ndignified and sober.  \"I say, sir, that if you ever venture again to talk\nand look as you have done to-night, why, sir, I will ring the bell and\nhave you shown the door by my servants.  So now you're warned, my fine\nfellow!\"  He sat down, laughing a foolish tipsy laugh of triumph.  In\nanother minute his arm was held firmly but gently by Ralph.\n\n\"Listen, Mr. Wilkins,\" he said, in a low hoarse voice.  \"You shall never\nhave to say to me twice what you have said to-night.  Henceforward we are\nas strangers to each other.  As to Ellinor\"--his tones softened a little,\nand he sighed in spite of himself--\"I do not think we should have been\nhappy.  I believe our engagement was formed when we were too young to\nknow our own minds, but I would have done my duty and kept to my word;\nbut you, sir, have yourself severed the connection between us by your\ninsolence to-night.  I, to be turned out of your house by your\nservants!--I, a Corbet of Westley, who would not submit to such threats\nfrom a peer of the realm, let him be ever so drunk!\"  He was out of the\nroom, almost out of the house, before he had spoken the last words.\n\nMr. Wilkins sat still, first fiercely angry, then astonished, and lastly\ndismayed into sobriety.  \"Corbet, Corbet!  Ralph!\" he called in vain;\nthen he got up and went to the door, opened it, looked into the fully-\nlighted hall; all was so quiet there that he could hear the quiet voices\nof the women in the drawing-room talking together.  He thought for a\nmoment, went to the hat-stand, and missed Ralph's low-crowned straw hat.\n\nThen he sat down once more in the dining-room, and endeavoured to make\nout exactly what had passed; but he could not believe that Mr. Corbet had\ncome to any enduring or final resolution to break off his engagement, and\nhe had almost reasoned himself back into his former state of indignation\nat impertinence and injury, when Ellinor came in, pale, hurried, and\nanxious.\n\n\"Papa! what does this mean?\" said she, putting an open note into his\nhand.  He took up his glasses, but his hand shook so that he could hardly\nread.  The note was from the Parsonage, to Ellinor; only three lines sent\nby Mr. Ness's servant, who had come to fetch Mr. Corbet's things.  He had\nwritten three lines with some consideration for Ellinor, even when he was\nin his first flush of anger against her father, and it must be confessed\nof relief at his own freedom, thus brought about by the act of another,\nand not of his own working out, which partly saved his conscience.  The\nnote ran thus:\n\n   \"DEAR ELLINOR,--Words have passed between your father and me which\n   have obliged me to leave his house, I fear, never to return to it.  I\n   will write more fully to-morrow.  But do not grieve too much, for I am\n   not, and never have been, good enough for you.  God bless you, my\n   dearest Nelly, though I call you so for the last time.--R. C.\"\n\n\"Papa, what is it?\" Ellinor cried, clasping her hands together, as her\nfather sat silent, vacantly gazing into the fire, after finishing the\nnote.\n\n\"I don't know!\" said he, looking up at her piteously; \"it's the world, I\nthink.  Everything goes wrong with me and mine: it went wrong before THAT\nnight--so it can't be that, can it, Ellinor?\"\n\n\"Oh, papa!\" said she, kneeling down by him, her face hidden on his\nbreast.\n\nHe put one arm languidly round her.  \"I used to read of Orestes and the\nFuries at Eton when I was a boy, and I thought it was all a heathen\nfiction.  Poor little motherless girl!\" said he, laying his other hand on\nher head, with the caressing gesture he had been accustomed to use when\nshe had been a little child.  \"Did you love him so very dearly, Nelly?\"\nhe whispered, his cheek against her: \"for somehow of late he has not\nseemed to me good enough for thee.  He has got an inkling that something\nhas gone wrong, and he was very inquisitive--I may say he questioned me\nin a relentless kind of way.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, it was my doing, I'm afraid.  I said something long ago about\npossible disgrace.\"\n\nHe pushed her away; he stood up, and looked at her with the eyes dilated,\nhalf in fear, half in fierceness, of an animal at bay; he did not heed\nthat his abrupt movement had almost thrown her prostrate on the ground.\n\n\"You, Ellinor!  You--you--\"\n\n\"Oh, darling father, listen!\" said she, creeping to his knees, and\nclasping them with her hands.  \"I said it, as if it were a possible case,\nof some one else--last August--but he immediately applied it, and asked\nme if it was over me the disgrace, or shame--I forget the words we\nused--hung; and what could I say?\"\n\n\"Anything--anything to put him off the scent.  God help me, I am a lost\nman, betrayed by my child!\"\n\nEllinor let go his knees, and covered her face.  Every one stabbed at\nthat poor heart.  In a minute or so her father spoke again.\n\n\"I don't mean what I say.  I often don't mean it now.  Ellinor, you must\nforgive me, my child!\"  He stooped, and lifted her up, and sat down,\ntaking her on his knee, and smoothing her hair off her hot forehead.\n\"Remember, child, how very miserable I am, and have forgiveness for me.\nHe had none, and yet he must have seen I had been drinking.\"\n\n\"Drinking, papa!\" said Ellinor, raising her head, and looking at him with\nsorrowful surprise.\n\n\"Yes.  I drink now to try and forget,\" said he, blushing and confused.\n\n\"Oh, how miserable we are!\" cried Ellinor, bursting into tears--\"how very\nmiserable!  It seems almost as if God had forgotten to comfort us!\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" said he.  \"Your mother said once she did so pray that you\nmight grow up religious; you must be religious, child, because she prayed\nfor it so often.  Poor Lettice, how glad I am that you are dead!\"  Here\nhe began to cry like a child.  Ellinor comforted him with kisses rather\nthan words.  He pushed her away, after a while, and said, sharply: \"How\nmuch does he know?  I must make sure of that.  How much did you tell him,\nEllinor?\"\n\n\"Nothing--nothing, indeed, papa, but what I told you just now!\"\n\n\"Tell it me again--the exact words!\"\n\n\"I will, as well as I can; but it was last August.  I only said, 'Was it\nright for a woman to marry, knowing that disgrace hung over her, and\nkeeping her lover in ignorance of it?'\"\n\n\"That was all, you are sure?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He immediately applied the case to me--to ourselves.\"\n\n\"And he never wanted to know what was the nature of the threatened\ndisgrace?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did.\"\n\n\"And you told him?\"\n\n\"No, not a word more.  He referred to the subject again to-day, in the\nshrubbery; but I told him nothing more.  You quite believe me, don't you,\npapa?\"\n\nHe pressed her to him, but did not speak.  Then he took the note up\nagain, and read it with as much care and attention as he could collect in\nhis agitated state of mind.\n\n\"Nelly,\" said he, at length, \"he says true; he is not good enough for\nthee.  He shrinks from the thought of the disgrace.  Thou must stand\nalone, and bear the sins of thy father.\"\n\nHe shook so much as he said this, that Ellinor had to put any suffering\nof her own on one side, and try to confine her thoughts to the necessity\nof getting her father immediately up to bed.  She sat by him till he went\nto sleep, and she could leave him, and go to her own room, to\nforgetfulness and rest, if she could find those priceless blessings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nMr. Corbet was so well known at the Parsonage by the two old servants,\nthat he had no difficulty, on reaching it, after his departure from Ford\nBank, in having the spare bed-chamber made ready for him, late as it was,\nand in the absence of the master, who had taken a little holiday, now\nthat Lent and Easter were over, for the purpose of fishing.  While his\nroom was getting ready, Ralph sent for his clothes, and by the same\nmessenger he despatched the little note to Ellinor.  But there was the\nletter he had promised her in it still to be written; and it was almost\nhis night's employment to say enough, yet not too much; for, as he\nexpressed it to himself, he was half way over the stream, and it would be\nfolly to turn back, for he had given nearly as much pain both to himself\nand Ellinor by this time as he should do by making the separation final.\nBesides, after Mr. Wilkins's speeches that evening--but he was candid\nenough to acknowledge that, bad and offensive as they had been, if they\nhad stood alone they might have been condoned.\n\nHis letter ran as follows:\n\n   \"DEAREST ELLINOR, for dearest you are, and I think will ever be, my\n   judgment has consented to a step which is giving me great pain,\n   greater than you will readily believe.  I am convinced that it is\n   better that we should part; for circumstances have occurred since we\n   formed our engagement which, although I am unaware of their exact\n   nature, I can see weigh heavily upon you, and have materially affected\n   your father's behaviour.  Nay, I think, after to-night, I may almost\n   say have entirely altered his feelings towards me.  What these\n   circumstances are I am ignorant, any further than that I know from\n   your own admission, that they may lead to some future disgrace.  Now,\n   it may be my fault, it may be in my temperament, to be anxious, above\n   all things earthly, to obtain and possess a high reputation.  I can\n   only say that it is so, and leave you to blame me for my weakness as\n   much as you like.  But anything that might come in between me and this\n   object would, I own, be ill tolerated by me; the very dread of such an\n   obstacle intervening would paralyse me.  I should become irritable,\n   and, deep as my affection is, and always must be, towards you, I could\n   not promise you a happy, peaceful life.  I should be perpetually\n   haunted by the idea of what might happen in the way of discovery and\n   shame.  I am the more convinced of this from my observation of your\n   father's altered character--an alteration which I trace back to the\n   time when I conjecture that the secret affairs took place to which you\n   have alluded.  In short, it is for your sake, my dear Ellinor, even\n   more than for my own, that I feel compelled to affix a final meaning\n   to the words which your father addressed to me last night, when he\n   desired me to leave his house for ever.  God bless you, my Ellinor,\n   for the last time my Ellinor.  Try to forget as soon as you can the\n   unfortunate tie which has bound you for a time to one so unsuitable--I\n   believe I ought to say so unworthy of you--as--RALPH CORBET.\"\n\nEllinor was making breakfast when this letter was given her.  According\nto the wont of the servants of the respective households of the Parsonage\nand Ford Bank, the man asked if there was any answer.  It was only\ncustom; for he had not been desired to do so.  Ellinor went to the window\nto read her letter; the man waiting all the time respectfully for her\nreply.  She went to the writing-table, and wrote:\n\n   \"It is all right--quite right.  I ought to have thought of it all last\n   August.  I do not think you will forget me easily, but I entreat you\n   never at any future time to blame yourself.  I hope you will be happy\n   and successful.  I suppose I must never write to you again: but I\n   shall always pray for you.  Papa was very sorry last night for having\n   spoken angrily to you.  You must forgive him--there is great need for\n   forgiveness in this world.--ELLINOR.\"\n\nShe kept putting down thought after thought, just to prolong the last\npleasure of writing to him.  She sealed the note, and gave it to the man.\nThen she sat down and waited for Miss Monro, who had gone to bed on the\nprevious night without awaiting Ellinor's return from the dining-room.\n\n\"I am late, my dear,\" said Miss Monro, on coming down, \"but I have a bad\nheadache, and I knew you had a pleasant companion.\"  Then, looking round,\nshe perceived Ralph's absence.\n\n\"Mr. Corbet not down yet!\" she exclaimed.  And then Ellinor had to tell\nher the outline of the facts so soon likely to be made public; that Mr.\nCorbet and she had determined to break off their engagement; and that Mr.\nCorbet had accordingly betaken himself to the Parsonage; and that she did\nnot expect him to return to Ford Bank.  Miss Monro's astonishment was\nunbounded.  She kept going over and over all the little circumstances she\nhad noticed during the last visit, only on yesterday, in fact, which she\ncould not reconcile with the notion that the two, apparently so much\nattached to each other but a few hours before, were now to be for ever\nseparated and estranged.  Ellinor sickened under the torture; which yet\nseemed like torture in a dream, from which there must come an awakening\nand a relief.  She felt as if she could not hear any more; yet there was\nmore to hear.  Her father, as it turned out, was very ill, and had been\nso all night long; he had evidently had some kind of attack on the brain,\nwhether apoplectic or paralytic it was for the doctors to decide.  In the\nhurry and anxiety of this day of misery succeeding to misery, she almost\nforgot to wonder whether Ralph were still at the Parsonage--still in\nHamley; it was not till the evening visit of the physician that she\nlearnt that he had been seen by Dr. Moore as he was taking his place in\nthe morning mail to London.  Dr. Moore alluded to his name as to a\nthought that would cheer and comfort the fragile girl during her night-\nwatch by her father's bedside.  But Miss Monro stole out after the doctor\nto warn him off the subject for the future, crying bitterly over the\nforlorn position of her darling as she spoke--crying as Ellinor had never\nyet been able to cry: though all the time, in the pride of her sex, she\nwas as endeavouring to persuade the doctor it was entirely Ellinor's\ndoing, and the wisest and best thing she could have done, as he was not\ngood enough for her, only a poor barrister struggling for a livelihood.\nLike many other kind-hearted people, she fell into the blunder of\nlowering the moral character of those whom it is their greatest wish to\nexalt.  But Dr. Moore knew Ellinor too well to believe the whole of what\nMiss Monro said; she would never act from interested motives, and was all\nthe more likely to cling to a man because he was down and unsuccessful.\nNo! there had been a lovers' quarrel; and it could not have happened at a\nsadder time.\n\nBefore the June roses were in full bloom, Mr. Wilkins was dead.  He had\nleft his daughter to the guardianship of Mr. Ness by some will made years\nago; but Mr. Ness had caught a rheumatic fever with his Easter fishings,\nand been unable to be moved home from the little Welsh inn where he had\nbeen staying when he was taken ill.  Since his last attack, Mr. Wilkins's\nmind had been much affected; he often talked strangely and wildly; but he\nhad rare intervals of quietness and full possession of his senses.  At\none of these times he must have written a half-finished pencil note,\nwhich his nurse found under his pillow after his death, and brought to\nEllinor.  Through her tear-blinded eyes she read the weak, faltering\nwords:\n\n   \"I am very ill.  I sometimes think I shall never get better, so I wish\n   to ask your pardon for what I said the night before I was taken ill.  I\n   am afraid my anger made mischief between you and Ellinor, but I think\n   you will forgive a dying man.  If you will come back and let all be as\n   it used to be, I will make any apology you may require.  If I go, she\n   will be so very friendless; and I have looked to you to care for her\n   ever since you first--\"  Then came some illegible and incoherent\n   writing, ending with, \"From my deathbed I adjure you to stand her\n   friend; I will beg pardon on my knees for anything--\"\n\nAnd there strength had failed; the paper and pencil had been laid aside\nto be resumed at some time when the brain was clearer, the hand stronger.\nEllinor kissed the letter, reverently folded it up, and laid it among her\nsacred treasures, by her mother's half-finished sewing, and a little curl\nof her baby sister's golden hair.\n\nMr. Johnson, who had been one of the trustees for Mrs. Wilkins's marriage\nsettlement, a respectable solicitor in the county town, and Mr. Ness, had\nbeen appointed executors of his will, and guardians to Ellinor.  The will\nitself had been made several years before, when he imagined himself the\npossessor of a handsome fortune, the bulk of which he bequeathed to his\nonly child.  By her mother's marriage-settlement, Ford Bank was held in\ntrust for the children of the marriage; the trustees being Sir Frank\nHolster and Mr. Johnson.  There were legacies to his executors; a small\nannuity to Miss Monro, with the expression of a hope that it might be\narranged for her to continue living with Ellinor as long as the latter\nremained unmarried; all his servants were remembered, Dixon especially,\nand most liberally.\n\nWhat remained of the handsome fortune once possessed by the testator?  The\nexecutors asked in vain; there was nothing.  They could hardly make out\nwhat had become of it, in such utter confusion were all the accounts,\nboth personal and official.  Mr. Johnson was hardly restrained by his\ncompassion for the orphan from throwing up the executorship in disgust.\nMr. Ness roused himself from his scholarlike abstraction to labour at the\nexamination of books, parchments, and papers, for Ellinor's sake.  Sir\nFrank Holster professed himself only a trustee for Ford Bank.\n\nMeanwhile she went on living at Ford Bank, quite unconscious of the state\nof her father's affairs, but sunk into a deep, plaintive melancholy,\nwhich affected her looks and the tones of her voice in such a manner as\nto distress Miss Monro exceedingly.  It was not that the good lady did\nnot quite acknowledge the great cause her pupil had for grieving--deserted\nby her lover, her father dead--but that she could not bear the outward\nsigns of how much these sorrows had told on Ellinor.  Her love for the\npoor girl was infinitely distressed by seeing the daily wasting away, the\nconstant heavy depression of spirits, and she grew impatient of the\ncontinual pain of sympathy.  If Miss Monro could have done something to\nrelieve Ellinor of her woe, she would have been less inclined to scold\nher for giving way to it.\n\nThe time came when Miss Monro could act; and after that, there was no\nmore irritation on her part.  When all hope of Ellinor's having anything\nbeyond the house and grounds of Ford Bank was gone; when it was proved\nthat all the legacies bequeathed by Mr. Wilkins not one farthing could\never be paid; when it came to be a question how far the beautiful\npictures and other objects of art in the house were not legally the\nproperty of unsatisfied creditors, the state of her father's affairs was\ncommunicated to Ellinor as delicately as Mr. Ness knew how.\n\nShe was drooping over her work--she always drooped now--and she left off\nsewing to listen to him, leaning her head on the arm which rested on the\ntable.  She did not speak when he had ended his statement.  She was\nsilent for whole minutes afterwards; he went on speaking out of very\nagitation and awkwardness.\n\n\"It was all the rascal Dunster's doing, I've no doubt,\" said he, trying\nto account for the entire loss of Mr. Wilkins's fortune.\n\nTo his surprise she lifted up her white stony face, and said slowly and\nfaintly, but with almost solemn calmness:\n\n\"Mr. Ness, you must never allow Mr. Dunster to be blamed for this!\"\n\n\"My dear Ellinor, there can be no doubt about it.  Your father himself\nalways referred to the losses he had sustained by Dunster's\ndisappearance.\"\n\nEllinor covered her face with her hands.  \"God forgive us all,\" she said,\nand relapsed into the old unbearable silence.  Mr. Ness had undertaken to\ndiscuss her future plans with her, and he was obliged to go on.\n\n\"Now, my dear child--I have known you since you were quite a little girl,\nyou know--we must try not to give way to feeling\"--he himself was\nchoking; she was quite quiet--\"but think what is to be done.  You will\nhave the rent of this house, and we have a very good offer for it--a\ntenant on lease of seven years at a hundred and twenty pounds a year--\"\n\n\"I will never let this house,\" said she, standing up suddenly, and as if\ndefying him.\n\n\"Not let Ford Bank!  Why?  I don't understand it--I can't have been\nclear--Ellinor, the rent of this house is all you will have to live on!\"\n\n\"I can't help it, I can't leave this house.  Oh, Mr. Ness, I can't leave\nthis house.\"\n\n\"My dear child, you shall not be hurried--I know how hardly all these\nthings are coming upon you (and I wish I had never seen Corbet, with all\nmy heart I do!)\"--this was almost to himself, but she must have heard it,\nfor she quivered all over--\"but leave this house you must.  You must eat,\nand the rent of this house must pay for your food; you must dress, and\nthere is nothing but the rent to clothe you.  I will gladly have you to\nstay at the Parsonage as long as ever you like; but, in fact, the\nnegotiations with Mr. Osbaldistone, the gentleman who offers to take the\nhouse, are nearly completed--\"\n\n\"It is my house!\" said Ellinor, fiercely.  \"I know it is settled on me.\"\n\n\"No, my dear.  It is held in trust for you by Sir Frank Holster and Mr.\nJohnson; you to receive all moneys and benefits accruing from it\"--he\nspoke gently, for he almost thought her head was turned--\"but you\nremember you are not of age, and Mr. Johnson and I have full power.\"\n\nEllinor sat down, helpless.\n\n\"Leave me,\" she said, at length.  \"You are very kind, but you don't know\nall.  I cannot stand any more talking now,\" she added, faintly.\n\nMr. Ness bent over her and kissed her forehead, and withdrew without\nanother word.  He went to Miss Monro.\n\n\"Well! and how did you find her?\" was her first inquiry, after the usual\ngreetings had passed between them.  \"It is really quite sad to see how\nshe gives way; I speak to her, and speak to her, and tell her how she is\nneglecting all her duties, and it does no good.\"\n\n\"She has had to bear a still further sorrow to-day,\" said Mr. Ness.  \"On\nthe part of Mr. Johnson and myself I have a very painful duty to perform\nto you as well as to her.  Mr. Wilkins has died insolvent.  I grieve to\nsay there is no hope of your ever receiving any of your annuity!\"\n\nMiss Monro looked very blank.  Many happy little visions faded away in\nthose few moments; then she roused up and said, \"I am but forty; I have a\ngood fifteen years of work in me left yet, thank God.  Insolvent!  Do you\nmean he has left no money?\"\n\n\"Not a farthing.  The creditors may be thankful if they are fully paid.\"\n\n\"And Ellinor?\"\n\n\"Ellinor will have the rent of this house, which is hers by right of her\nmother's settlement, to live on.\"\n\n\"How much will that be?\"\n\n\"One hundred and twenty pounds.\"\n\nMiss Monro's lips went into a form prepared for whistling.  Mr. Ness\ncontinued:\n\n\"She is at present unwilling enough to leave this house, poor girl.  It\nis but natural; but she has no power in the matter, even were there any\nother course open to her.  I can only say how glad, how honoured, I shall\nfeel by as long a visit as you and she can be prevailed upon to pay me at\nthe Parsonage.\"\n\n\"Where is Mr. Corbet?\" said Miss Monro.\n\n\"I do not know.  After breaking off his engagement he wrote me a long\nletter, explanatory, as he called it; exculpatory, as I termed it.  I\nwrote back, curtly enough, saying that I regretted the breaking-off of an\nintercourse which had always been very pleasant to me, but that he must\nbe aware that, with my intimacy with the family at Ford Bank, it would be\nboth awkward and unpleasant to all parties if he and I remained on our\nprevious footing.  Who is that going past the window?  Ellinor riding?\"\n\nMiss Monro went to the window.  \"Yes!  I am thankful to see her on\nhorseback again.  It was only this morning I advised her to have a ride!\"\n\n\"Poor Dixon! he will suffer too; his legacy can no more be paid than the\nothers; and it is not many young ladies who will be as content to have so\nold-fashioned a groom riding after them as Ellinor seems to be.\"\n\nAs soon as Mr. Ness had left, Miss Monro went to her desk and wrote a\nlong letter to some friends she had at the cathedral town of East\nChester, where she had spent some happy years of her former life.  Her\nthoughts had gone back to this time even while Mr. Ness had been\nspeaking; for it was there her father had lived, and it was after his\ndeath that her cares in search of a subsistence had begun.  But the\nrecollections of the peaceful years spent there were stronger than the\nremembrance of the weeks of sorrow and care; and, while Ellinor's\nmarriage had seemed a probable event, she had made many a little plan of\nreturning to her native place, and obtaining what daily teaching she\ncould there meet with, and the friends to whom she was now writing had\npromised her their aid.  She thought that as Ellinor had to leave Ford\nBank, a home at a distance might be more agreeable to her, and she went\non to plan that they should live together, if possible, on her earnings,\nand the small income that would be Ellinor's.  Miss Monro loved her pupil\nso dearly, that, if her own pleasure only were to be consulted, this\nprojected life would be more agreeable to her than if Mr. Wilkins's\nlegacy had set her in independence, with Ellinor away from her, married,\nand with interests in which her former governess had but little part.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Ness had left her, Ellinor rang the bell, and startled the\nservant who answered it by her sudden sharp desire to have the horses at\nthe door as soon as possible, and to tell Dixon to be ready to go out\nwith her.\n\nShe felt that she must speak to him, and in her nervous state she wanted\nto be out on the free broad common, where no one could notice or remark\ntheir talk.  It was long since she had ridden, and much wonder was\nexcited by the sudden movement in kitchen and stable-yard.  But Dixon\nwent gravely about his work of preparation, saying nothing.\n\nThey rode pretty hard till they reached Monk's Heath, six or seven miles\naway from Hamley.  Ellinor had previously determined that here she would\ntalk over the plan Mr. Ness had proposed to her with Dixon, and he seemed\nto understand her without any words passing between them.  When she\nreined in he rode up to her, and met the gaze of her sad eyes with\nsympathetic, wistful silence.\n\n\"Dixon,\" said she, \"they say I must leave Ford Bank.\"\n\n\"I was afeared on it, from all I've heerd say i' the town since the\nmaster's death.\"\n\n\"Then you've heard--then you know--that papa has left hardly any money--my\npoor dear Dixon, you won't have your legacy, and I never thought of that\nbefore!\"\n\n\"Never heed, never heed,\" said he, eagerly; \"I couldn't have touched it\nif it had been there, for the taking it would ha' seemed too like--\"\nBlood-money, he was going to say, but he stopped in time.  She guessed\nthe meaning, though not the word he would have used.\n\n\"No, not that,\" said she; \"his will was dated years before.  But oh,\nDixon, what must I do?  They will make me leave Ford Bank, I see.  I\nthink the trustees have half let it already.\"\n\n\"But you'll have the rent on't, I reckon?\" asked he, anxiously.  \"I've\nmany a time heerd 'em say as it was settled on the missus first, and then\non you.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it is not that; but you know, under the beech-tree--\"\n\n\"Ay!\" said he, heavily.  \"It's been oftentimes on my mind, waking, and I\nthink there's ne'er a night as I don't dream of it.\"\n\n\"But how can I leave it!\" Ellinor cried.  \"They may do a hundred\nthings--may dig up the shrubbery.  Oh! Dixon, I feel as if it was sure to\nbe found out!  Oh! Dixon, I cannot bear any more blame on papa--it will\nkill me--and such a dreadful thing, too!\"\n\nDixon's face fell into the lines of habitual pain that it had always\nassumed of late years whenever he was thinking or remembering anything.\n\n\"They must ne'er ha' reason to speak ill of the dead, that's for\ncertain,\" said he.  \"The Wilkinses have been respected in Hamley all my\nlifetime, and all my father's before me, and--surely, missy, there's ways\nand means of tying tenants up from alterations both in the house and out\nof it, and I'd beg the trustees, or whatever they's called, to be very\nparticular, if I was you, and not have a thing touched either in the\nhouse, or the gardens, or the meadows, or the stables.  I think, wi' a\nword from you, they'd maybe keep me on i' the stables, and I could look\nafter things a bit; and the Day o' Judgment will come at last, when all\nour secrets will be made known wi'out our having the trouble and the\nshame o' telling 'em.  I'm getting rayther tired o' this world, Miss\nEllinor.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so,\" said Ellinor, tenderly.  \"I know how sad it is, but, oh!\nremember how I shall want a friend when you're gone, to advise me as you\nhave done to-day.  You're not feeling ill, Dixon, are you?\" she\ncontinued, anxiously.\n\n\"No!  I'm hearty enough, and likely for t' live.  Father was eighty-one,\nand mother above the seventies, when they died.  It's only my heart as is\ngot to feel so heavy; and as for that matter, so is yours, I'll be bound.\nAnd it's a comfort to us both if we can serve him as is dead by any care\nof ours, for he were such a bright handsome lad, with such a cheery face,\nas never should ha' known shame.\"\n\nThey rode on without much more speaking.  Ellinor was silently planning\nfor Dixon, and he, not caring to look forward to the future, was bringing\nup before his fancy the time, thirty years ago, when he had first entered\nthe elder Mr. Wilkins's service as stable-lad, and pretty Molly, the\nscullery-maid, was his daily delight.  Pretty Molly lay buried in Hamley\nchurchyard, and few living, except Dixon, could have gone straight to her\ngrave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nIn a few days Miss Monro obtained a most satisfactory reply to her letter\nof inquiries as to whether a daily governess could find employment in\nEast Chester.  For once the application seemed to have come just at the\nright time.  The canons were most of them married men, with young\nfamilies; those at present in residence welcomed the idea of such\ninstruction as Miss Monro could offer for their children, and could\nalmost answer for their successors in office.  This was a great step\ngained.  Miss Monro, the daughter of a precentor to this very cathedral,\nhad a secret unwillingness to being engaged as a teacher by any wealthy\ntradesman there; but to be received into the canons' families, in almost\nany capacity, was like going home.  Moreover, besides the empty honour of\nthe thing, there were many small pieces of patronage in the gift of the\nChapter--such as a small house opening on to the Close, which had\nformerly belonged to the verger, but which was now vacant, and was\noffered to Miss Monro at a nominal rent.\n\nEllinor had once more sunk into her old depressed passive state; Mr. Ness\nand Miss Monro, modest and undecided as they both were in general, had to\nfix and arrange everything for her.  Her great interest seemed to be in\nthe old servant Dixon, and her great pleasure to lie in seeing him, and\ntalking over old times; so her two friends talked about her, little\nknowing what a bitter, stinging pain her \"pleasure\" was.  In vain Ellinor\ntried to plan how they could take Dixon with them to East Chester.  If he\nhad been a woman it would have been a feasible step; but they were only\nto keep one servant, and Dixon, capable and versatile as he was, would\nnot do for that servant.  All this was what passed through Ellinor's\nmind: it is still a question whether Dixon would have felt his love of\nhis native place, with all its associations and remembrances, or his love\nfor Ellinor, the stronger.  But he was not put to the proof; he was only\ntold that he must leave, and seeing Ellinor's extreme grief at the idea\nof their separation, he set himself to comfort her by every means in his\npower, reminding her, with tender choice of words, how necessary it was\nthat he should remain on the spot, in Mr. Osbaldistone's service, in\norder to frustrate, by any small influence he might have, every project\nof alteration in the garden that contained the dreadful secret.  He\npersisted in this view, though Ellinor repeated, with pertinacious\nanxiety, the care which Mr. Johnson had taken, in drawing up the lease,\nto provide against any change or alteration being made in the present\ndisposition of the house or grounds.\n\nPeople in general were rather astonished at the eagerness Miss Wilkins\nshowed to sell all the Ford Bank furniture.  Even Miss Monro was a little\nscandalized at this want of sentiment, although she said nothing about\nit; indeed justified the step, by telling every one how wisely Ellinor\nwas acting, as the large, handsome, tables and chairs would be very much\nout of place and keeping with the small, oddly-shaped rooms of their\nfuture home in East Chester Close.  None knew how strong was the instinct\nof self-preservation, it may almost be called, which impelled Ellinor to\nshake off, at any cost of present pain, the incubus of a terrible\nremembrance.  She wanted to go into an unhaunted dwelling in a free,\nunknown country--she felt as if it was her only chance of sanity.\nSometimes she thought her senses would not hold together till the time\nwhen all these arrangements were ended.  But she did not speak to any one\nabout her feelings, poor child; to whom could she speak on the subject\nbut to Dixon?  Nor did she define them to herself.  All she knew was,\nthat she was as nearly going mad as possible; and if she did, she feared\nthat she might betray her father's guilt.  All this time she never cried,\nor varied from her dull, passive demeanour.  And they were blessed tears\nof relief that she shed when Miss Monro, herself weeping bitterly, told\nher to put her head out of the post-chaise window, for at the next\nturning of the road they would catch the last glimpse of Hamley church\nspire.\n\nLate one October evening, Ellinor had her first sight of East Chester\nClose, where she was to pass the remainder of her life.  Miss Monro had\nbeen backwards and forwards between Hamley and East Chester more than\nonce, while Ellinor remained at the parsonage; so she had not only the\npride of proprietorship in the whole of the beautiful city, but something\nof the desire of hospitably welcoming Ellinor to their joint future home.\n\n\"Look! the fly must take us a long round, because of our luggage; but\nbehind these high old walls are the canons' gardens.  That high-pitched\nroof, with the clumps of stonecrop on the walls near it, is Canon\nWilson's, whose four little girls I am to teach.  Hark! the great\ncathedral clock.  How proud I used to be of its great boom when I was a\nchild!  I thought all the other church clocks in the town sounded so\nshrill and poor after that, which I considered mine especially.  There\nare rooks flying home to the elms in the Close.  I wonder if they are the\nsame that used to be there when I was a girl.  They say the rook is a\nvery long-lived bird, and I feel as if I could swear to the way they are\ncawing.  Ay, you may smile, Ellinor, but I understand now those lines of\nGray's you used to say so prettily--\n\n   \"I feel the gales that from ye blow.\n   A momentary bliss bestow,\n      And breathe a second spring.\"\n\nNow, dear, you must get out.  This flagged walk leads to our front-door;\nbut our back rooms, which are the pleasantest, look on to the Close, and\nthe cathedral, and the lime-tree walk, and the deanery, and the rookery.\"\n\nIt was a mere slip of a house; the kitchen being wisely placed close to\nthe front-door, and so reserving the pretty view for the little dining-\nroom, out of which a glass-door opened into a small walled-in garden,\nwhich had again an entrance into the Close.  Upstairs was a bedroom to\nthe front, which Miss Monro had taken for herself, because as she said,\nshe had old associations with the back of every house in the High-street,\nwhile Ellinor mounted to the pleasant chamber above the tiny drawing-room\nboth of which looked on to the vast and solemn cathedral, and the\npeaceful dignified Close.  East Chester Cathedral is Norman, with a low,\nmassive tower, a grand, majestic nave, and a choir full of stately\nhistoric tombs.  The whole city is so quiet and decorous a place, that\nthe perpetual daily chants and hymns of praise seemed to sound far and\nwide over the roofs of the houses.  Ellinor soon became a regular\nattendant at all the morning and evening services.  The sense of worship\ncalmed and soothed her aching weary heart, and to be punctual to the\ncathedral hours she roused and exerted herself, when probably nothing\nelse would have been sufficient to this end.\n\nBy-and-by Miss Monro formed many acquaintances; she picked up, or was\npicked up by, old friends, and the descendants of old friends.  The grave\nand kindly canons, whose children she taught, called upon her with their\nwives, and talked over the former deans and chapters, of whom she had\nboth a personal and traditional knowledge, and as they walked away and\ntalked about her silent delicate-looking friend Miss Wilkins, and perhaps\nplanned some little present out of their fruitful garden or bounteous\nstores, which should make Miss Monro's table a little more tempting to\none apparently so frail as Ellinor, for the household was always spoken\nof as belonging to Miss Monro, the active and prominent person.  By-and-\nby, Ellinor herself won her way to their hearts, not by words or deeds,\nbut by her sweet looks and meek demeanour, as they marked her regular\nattendance at cathedral service: and when they heard of her constant\nvisits to a certain parochial school, and of her being sometimes seen\ncarrying a little covered basin to the cottages of the poor, they began\nto try and tempt her, with more urgent words, to accompany Miss Monro in\nher frequent tea-drinkings at their houses.  The old dean, that courteous\ngentleman and good Christian, had early become great friends with\nEllinor.  He would watch at the windows of his great vaulted library till\nhe saw her emerge from the garden into the Close, and then open the\ndeanery door, and join her, she softly adjusting the measure of her pace\nto his.  The time of his departure from East Chester became a great blank\nin her life, although she would never accept, or allow Miss Monro to\naccept, his repeated invitations to go and pay him a visit at his country-\nplace.  Indeed, having once tasted comparative peace again in East\nChester Cathedral Close, it seemed as though she was afraid of ever\nventuring out of those calm precincts.  All Mr. Ness's invitations to\nvisit him at his parsonage at Hamley were declined, although he was\nwelcomed at Miss Monro's, on the occasion of his annual visit, by every\nmeans in their power.  He slept at one of the canon's vacant houses, and\nlived with his two friends, who made a yearly festivity, to the best of\ntheir means, in his honour, inviting such of the cathedral clergy as were\nin residence: or, if they failed, condescending to the town clergy.  Their\nfriends knew well that no presents were so acceptable as those sent while\nMr. Ness was with them; and from the dean, who would send them a hamper\nof choice fruit and flowers from Oxton Park, down to the curate, who\nworked in the same schools as Ellinor, and who was a great fisher, and\ncaught splendid trout--all did their best to help them to give a welcome\nto the only visitor they ever had.  The only visitor they ever had, as\nfar as the stately gentry knew.  There was one, however, who came as\noften as his master could give him a holiday long enough to undertake a\njourney to so distant a place; but few knew of his being a guest at Miss\nMonro's, though his welcome there was not less hearty than Mr.\nNess's--this was Dixon.  Ellinor had convinced him that he could give her\nno greater pleasure at any time than by allowing her to frank him to and\nfrom East Chester.  Whenever he came they were together the greater part\nof the day; she taking him hither and thither to see all the sights that\nshe thought would interest or please him; but they spoke very little to\neach other during all this companionship.  Miss Monro had much more to\nsay to him.  She questioned him right and left whenever Ellinor was out\nof the room.  She learnt that the house at Ford Bank was splendidly\nfurnished, and no money spared on the garden; that the eldest Miss\nHanbury was very well married; that Brown had succeeded to Jones in the\nhaberdasher's shop.  Then she hesitated a little before making her next\ninquiry:\n\n\"I suppose Mr. Corbet never comes to the Parsonage now?\"\n\n\"No, not he.  I don't think as how Mr. Ness would have him; but they\nwrite letters to each other by times.  Old Job--you'll recollect old Job,\nma'am, he that gardened for Mr Ness, and waited in the parlour when there\nwas company--did say as one day he heerd them speaking about Mr. Corbet;\nand he's a grand counsellor now--one of them as goes about at\nassize-time, and speaks in a wig.\"\n\n\"A barrister, you mean,\" said Miss Monro.\n\n\"Ay; and he's something more than that, though I can't rightly remember\nwhat,\"\n\nEllinor could have told them both.  They had _The Times_ lent to them on\nthe second day after publication by one of their friends in the Close,\nand Ellinor, watching till Miss Monro's eyes were otherwise engaged,\nalways turned with trembling hands and a beating heart to the reports of\nthe various courts of law.  In them she found--at first rarely--the name\nshe sought for, the name she dwelt upon, as if every letter were a study.\nMr. Losh and Mr. Duncombe appeared for the plaintiff, Mr. Smythe and Mr.\nCorbet for the defendant.  In a year or two that name appeared more\nfrequently, and generally took the precedence of the other, whatever it\nmight be; then on special occasions his speeches were reported at full\nlength, as if his words were accounted weighty; and by-and-by she saw\nthat he had been appointed a Queen's counsel.  And this was all she ever\nheard or saw about him; his once familiar name never passed her lips\nexcept in hurried whispers to Dixon, when he came to stay with them.\nEllinor had had no idea when she parted from Mr. Corbet how total the\nseparation between them was henceforward to be, so much seemed left\nunfinished, unexplained.  It was so difficult, at first, to break herself\nof the habit of constant mental reference to him; and for many a long\nyear she kept thinking that surely some kind fortune would bring them\ntogether again, and all this heart-sickness and melancholy estrangement\nfrom each other would then seem to both only as an ugly dream that had\npassed away in the morning light.\n\nThe dean was an old man, but there was a canon who was older still, and\nwhose death had been expected by many, and speculated upon by some, any\ntime for ten years at least.  Canon Holdsworth was too old to show active\nkindness to any one; the good dean's life was full of thoughtful and\nbenevolent deeds.  But he was taken, and the other left.  Ellinor looked\nout at the vacant deanery with tearful eyes, the last thing at night, the\nfirst in the morning.  But it is pretty nearly the same with church\ndignitaries as with kings; the dean is dead, long live the dean!  A\nclergyman from a distant county was appointed, and all the Close was\nastir to learn and hear every particular connected with him.  Luckily he\ncame in at the tag-end of one of the noble families in the peerage; so,\nat any rate, all his future associates could learn with tolerable\ncertainty that he was forty-two years of age, married, and with eight\ndaughters and one son.  The deanery, formerly so quiet and sedate a\ndwelling of the one old man, was now to be filled with noise and\nmerriment.  Iron railings were being placed before three windows,\nevidently to be the nursery.  In the summer publicity of open windows and\ndoors, the sound of the busy carpenters was perpetually heard all over\nthe Close: and by-and-by waggon-loads of furniture and carriage-loads of\npeople began to arrive.  Neither Miss Monro nor Ellinor felt themselves\nof sufficient importance or station to call on the new comers, but they\nwere as well acquainted with the proceedings of the family as if they had\nbeen in daily intercourse; they knew that the eldest Miss Beauchamp was\nseventeen, and very pretty, only one shoulder was higher than the other;\nthat she was dotingly fond of dancing, and talked a great deal in a _tete-\na-tete_, but not much if her mamma was by, and never opened her lips at\nall if the dean was in the room; that the next sister was wonderfully\nclever, and was supposed to know all the governess could teach her, and\nto have private lessons in Greek and mathematics from her father; and so\non down to the little boy at the preparatory school and the baby-girl in\narms.  Moreover, Miss Monro, at any rate, could have stood an examination\nas to the number of servants at the deanery, their division of work, and\nthe hours of their meals.  Presently, a very beautiful, haughty-looking\nyoung lady made her appearance in the Close, and in the dean's pew.  She\nwas said to be his niece, the orphan daughter of his brother, General\nBeauchamp, come to East Chester to reside for the necessary time before\nher marriage, which was to be performed in the cathedral by her uncle,\nthe new dignitary.  But as callers at the deanery did not see this\nbeautiful bride elect, and as the Beauchamps had not as yet fallen into\nhabits of intimacy with any of their new acquaintances, very little was\nknown of the circumstances of this approaching wedding beyond the\nparticulars given above.\n\nEllinor and Miss Monro sat at their drawing-room window, a little shaded\nby the muslin curtains, watching the busy preparations for the marriage,\nwhich was to take place the next day.  All morning long, hampers of fruit\nand flowers, boxes from the railway--for by this time East Chester had\ngot a railway--shop messengers, hired assistants, kept passing backwards\nand forwards in the busy Close.  Towards afternoon the bustle subsided,\nthe scaffolding was up, the materials for the next day's feast carried\nout of sight.  It was to be concluded that the bride elect was seeing to\nthe packing of her trousseau, helped by the merry multitude of cousins,\nand that the servants were arranging the dinner for the day, or the\nbreakfast for the morrow.  So Miss Monro had settled it, discussing every\ndetail and every probability as though she were a chief actor, instead of\nonly a distant, uncared-for spectator of the coming event.  Ellinor was\ntired, and now that there was nothing interesting going on, she had\nfallen back to her sewing, when she was startled by Miss Memo's\nexclamation:\n\n\"Look, look! here are two gentlemen coming along the lime-tree walk! it\nmust be the bridegroom and his friend.\"  Out of much sympathy, and some\ncuriosity, Ellinor bent forward, and saw, just emerging from the shadow\nof the trees on to the full afternoon sunlit pavement, Mr. Corbet and\nanother gentleman; the former changed, worn, aged, though with still the\nsame fine intellectual face, leaning on the arm of the younger taller\nman, and talking eagerly.  The other gentleman was doubtless the\nbridegroom, Ellinor said to herself; and yet her prophetic heart did not\nbelieve her words.  Even before the bright beauty at the deanery looked\nout of the great oriel window of the drawing-room, and blushed, and\nsmiled, and kissed her hand--a gesture replied to by Mr. Corbet with much\n_empressement_, while the other man only took off his hat, almost as if\nhe saw her there for the first time--Ellinor's greedy eyes watched him\ntill he was hidden from sight in the deanery, unheeding Miss Monro's\neager incoherent sentences, in turn entreating, apologising, comforting,\nand upbraiding.  Then she slowly turned her painful eyes upon Miss\nMonro's face, and moved her lips without a sound being heard, and fainted\ndead away.  In all her life she had never done so before, and when she\ncame round she was not like herself; in all probability the persistence\nand wilfulness she, who was usually so meek and docile, showed during the\nnext twenty-four hours, was the consequence of fever.  She resolved to be\npresent at the wedding; numbers were going; she would be unseen,\nunnoticed in the crowd; but whatever befell, go she would, and neither\nthe tears nor the prayers of Miss Monro could keep her back.  She gave no\nreason for this determination; indeed, in all probability she had none to\ngive; so there was no arguing the point.  She was inflexible to entreaty,\nand no one had any authority over her, except, perhaps, distant Mr. Ness.\nMiss Monro had all sorts of forebodings as to the possible scenes that\nmight come to pass.  But all went on as quietly as though the fullest\nsympathy pervaded every individual of the great numbers assembled.  No\none guessed that the muffled, veiled figure, sitting in the shadow behind\none of the great pillars, was that of one who had once hoped to stand at\nthe altar with the same bridegroom, who now cast tender looks at the\nbeautiful bride; her veil white and fairy-like, Ellinor's black and\nshrouding as that of any nun.\n\nAlready Mr. Corbet's name was known through the country as that of a\ngreat lawyer; people discussed his speeches and character far and wide;\nand the well-informed in legal gossip spoke of him as sure to be offered\na judgeship at the next vacancy.  So he, though grave, and middle-aged,\nand somewhat grey, divided attention and remark with his lovely bride,\nand her pretty train of cousin bridesmaids.  Miss Monro need not have\nfeared for Ellinor: she saw and heard all things as in a mist--a dream;\nas something she had to go through, before she could waken up to a\nreality of brightness in which her youth, and the hopes of her youth,\nshould be restored, and all these weary years of dreaminess and woe\nshould be revealed as nothing but the nightmare of a night.  She sat\nmotionless enough, still enough, Miss Monro by her, watching her as\nintently as a keeper watches a madman, and with the same purpose--to\nprevent any outburst even by bodily strength, if such restraint be\nneeded.  When all was over; when the principal personages of the ceremony\nhad filed into the vestry to sign their names; when the swarm of\ntownspeople were going out as swiftly as their individual notions of the\nrestraints of the sacred edifice permitted; when the great chords of the\n\"Wedding March\" clanged out from the organ, and the loud bells pealed\noverhead--Ellinor laid her hand in Miss Monro's.  \"Take me home,\" she\nsaid softly.  And Miss Monro led her home as one leads the blind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nThere are some people who imperceptibly float away from their youth into\nmiddle age, and thence pass into declining life with the soft and gentle\nmotion of happy years.  There are others who are whirled, in spite of\nthemselves, down dizzy rapids of agony away from their youth at one great\nbound, into old age with another sudden shock; and thence into the vast\ncalm ocean where there are no shore-marks to tell of time.\n\nThis last, it seemed, was to be Ellinor's lot.  Her youth had gone in a\nsingle night, fifteen years ago, and now she appeared to have become an\nelderly woman; very still and hopeless in look and movement, but as sweet\nand gentle in speech and smile as ever she had been in her happiest days.\nAll young people, when they came to know her, loved her dearly, though at\nfirst they might call her dull, and heavy to get on with; and as for\nchildren and old people, her ready watchful sympathy in their joys as\nwell as their sorrows was an unfailing passage to their hearts.  After\nthe first great shock of Mr. Corbet's marriage was over, she seemed to\npass into a greater peace than she had known for years; the last faint\nhope of happiness was gone; it would, perhaps, be more accurate to say,\nof the bright happiness she had planned for herself in her early youth.\nUnconsciously, she was being weaned from self-seeking in any shape, and\nher daily life became, if possible, more innocent and pure and holy.  One\nof the canons used to laugh at her for her constant attendance at all the\nservices, and for her devotion to good works, and call her always the\nreverend sister.  Miss Monro was a little annoyed at this faint clerical\njoke; Ellinor smiled quietly.  Miss Monro disapproved of Ellinor's grave\nways and sober severe style of dress.\n\n\"You may be as good as you like, my dear, and yet go dressed in some\npretty colour, instead of those perpetual blacks and greys, and then\nthere would be no need for me to be perpetually telling people you are\nonly four-and-thirty (and they don't believe me, though I tell them so\ntill I am black in the face).  Or, if you would but wear a decent-shaped\nbonnet, instead of always wearing those of the poky shape in fashion when\nyou were seventeen.\"\n\nThe old canon died, and some one was to be appointed in his stead.  These\nclerical preferments and appointments were the all-important interests to\nthe inhabitants of the Close, and the discussion of probabilities came up\ninvariably if any two met together, in street or house, or even in the\nvery cathedral itself.  At length it was settled, and announced by the\nhigher powers.  An energetic, hard-working clergyman from a distant part\nof the diocese, Livingstone by name, was to have the vacant canonry.\n\nMiss Monro said that the name was somehow familiar to her, and by degrees\nshe recollected the young curate who had come to inquire after Ellinor in\nthat dreadful illness she had had at Hamley in the year 1829.  Ellinor\nknew nothing of that visit; no more than Miss Monro did of what had\npassed between the two before that anxious night.  Ellinor just thought\nit possible it might be the same Mr. Livingstone, and would rather it\nwere not, because she did not feel as if she could bear the frequent\nthough not intimate intercourse she must needs have, if such were the\ncase, with one so closely associated with that great time of terror which\nshe was striving to bury out of sight by every effort in her power.  Miss\nMonro, on the contrary, was busy weaving a romance for her pupil; she\nthought of the passionate interest displayed by the fair young clergyman\nfifteen years ago, and believed that occasionally men could be constant,\nand hoped that if Mr. Livingstone were the new canon, he might prove the\n_rara avis_ which exists but once in a century.  He came, and it was the\nsame.  He looked a little stouter, a little older, but had still the gait\nand aspect of a young man.  His smooth fair face was scarcely lined at\nall with any marks of care; the blue eyes looked so kindly and peaceful,\nthat Miss Monro could scarcely fancy they were the same which she had\nseen fast filling with tears; the bland calm look of the whole man needed\nthe ennoblement of his evident devoutness to be raised into the type of\nholy innocence which some of the Romanists call the \"sacerdotal face.\"\nHis entire soul was in his work, and he looked as little likely to step\nforth in the character of either a hero of romance or a faithful lover as\ncould be imagined.  Still Miss Monro was not discouraged; she remembered\nthe warm, passionate feeling she had once seen break through the calm\nexterior, and she believed that what had happened once might occur again.\n\nOf course, while all eyes were directed on the new canon, he had to learn\nwho the possessors of those eyes were one by one; and it was probably\nsome time before the idea came into his mind that Miss Wilkins, the lady\nin black, with the sad pale face, so constant an attendant at service, so\nregular a visitor at the school, was the same Miss Wilkins as the bright\nvision of his youth.  It was her sweet smile at a painstaking child that\nbetrayed her--if, indeed, betrayal it might be called where there was no\nwish or effort to conceal anything.  Canon Livingstone left the\nschoolroom almost directly, and, after being for an hour or so in his\nhouse, went out to call on Mrs. Randall, the person who knew more of her\nneighbours' affairs than any one in East Chester.\n\nThe next day he called on Miss Wilkins herself.  She would have been very\nglad if he had kept on in his ignorance; it was so keenly painful to be\nin the company of one the sight of whom, even at a distance, had brought\nher such a keen remembrance of past misery; and when told of his call, as\nshe was sitting at her sewing in the dining-room, she had to nerve\nherself for the interview before going upstairs into the drawing-room,\nwhere he was being entertained by Miss Monro with warm demonstrations of\nwelcome.  A little contraction of the brow, a little compression of the\nlips, an increased pallor on Ellinor's part, was all that Miss Monro\ncould see in her, though she had put on her glasses with foresight and\nintention to observe.  She turned to the canon; his colour had certainly\ndeepened as he went forwards with out-stretched hand to meet Ellinor.\nThat was all that was to be seen; but on the slight foundation of that\nblush, Miss Monro built many castles; and when they faded away, one after\none, she recognised that they were only baseless visions.  She used to\nput the disappointment of her hopes down to Ellinor's unvaried calmness\nof demeanour, which might be taken for coldness of disposition; and to\nher steady refusal to allow Miss Monro to invite Canon Livingstone to the\nsmall teas they were in the habit of occasionally giving.  Yet he\npersevered in his calls; about once every fortnight he came, and would\nsit an hour or more, looking covertly at his watch, as if as Miss Monro\nshrewdly observed to herself, he did not go away at last because he\nwished to do so, but because he ought.  Sometimes Ellinor was present,\nsometimes she was away; in this latter case Miss Monro thought she could\ndetect a certain wistful watching of the door every time a noise was\nheard outside the room.  He always avoided any reference to former days\nat Hamley, and that, Miss Monro feared, was a bad sign.\n\nAfter this long uniformity of years without any event closely touching on\nEllinor's own individual life, with the one great exception of Mr.\nCorbet's marriage, something happened which much affected her.  Mr. Ness\ndied suddenly at his parsonage, and Ellinor learnt it first from Mr.\nBrown, a clergyman, whose living was near Hamley, and who had been sent\nfor by the Parsonage servants as soon as they discovered that it was not\nsleep, but death, that made their master so late in rising.\n\nMr. Brown had been appointed executer by his late friend, and wrote to\ntell Ellinor that after a few legacies were paid, she was to have a life-\ninterest in the remainder of the small property which Mr. Ness had left,\nand that it would be necessary for her, as the residuary legatee, to come\nto Hamley Parsonage as soon as convenient, to decide upon certain courses\nof action with regard to furniture, books, &c.\n\nEllinor shrank from this journey, which her love and duty towards her\ndead friend rendered necessary.  She had scarcely left East Chester since\nshe first arrived there, sixteen or seventeen years ago, and she was\ntimorous about the very mode of travelling; and then to go back to\nHamley, which she thought never to have seen again!  She never spoke much\nabout any feelings of her own, but Miss Monro could always read her\nsilence, and interpreted it into pretty just and forcible words that\nafternoon when Canon Livingstone called.  She liked to talk about Ellinor\nto him, and suspected that he liked to hear.  She was almost annoyed this\ntime by the comfort he would keep giving her; there was no greater danger\nin travelling by railroad than by coach, a little care about certain\nthings was required, that was all, and the average number of deaths by\naccidents on railroads was not greater than the average number when\npeople travelled by coach, if you took into consideration the far greater\nnumber of travellers.  Yes! returning to the deserted scenes of one's\nyouth was very painful . . . Had Miss Wilkins made any provision for\nanother lady to take her place as visitor at the school?  He believed it\nwas her week.  Miss Monro was out of all patience at his entire calmness\nand reasonableness.  Later in the day she became more at peace with him,\nwhen she received a kind little note from Mrs. Forbes, a great friend of\nhers, and the mother of the family she was now teaching, saying that\nCanon Livingstone had called and told her that Ellinor had to go on a\nvery painful journey, and that Mrs. Forbes was quite sure Miss Monro's\ncompanionship upon it would be a great comfort to both, and that she\ncould perfectly be set at liberty for a fortnight or so, for it would\nfall in admirably with the fact that \"Jeanie was growing tall, and the\ndoctor had advised sea air this spring; so a month's holiday would suit\nthem now even better than later on.\"  Was this going straight to Mrs.\nForbes, to whom she should herself scarcely have liked to name it, the\nact of a good, thoughtful man, or of a lover? questioned Miss Monro; but\nshe could not answer her own inquiry, and had to be very grateful for the\ndeed, without accounting for the motives.\n\nA coach met the train at a station about ten miles from Hamley, and Dixon\nwas at the inn where the coach stopped, ready to receive them.\n\nThe old man was almost in tears at the sight of them again in a familiar\nplace.  He had put on his Sunday clothes to do them honour; and to\nconceal his agitation he kept up a pretended bustle about their luggage.\nTo the indignation of the inn-porters, who were of a later generation, he\nwould wheel it himself to the Parsonage, though he broke down from\nfatigue once or twice on the way, and had to stand and rest, his ladies\nwaiting by his side, and making remarks on the alterations of houses and\nthe places of trees, in order to give him ample time to recruit himself,\nfor there was no one to wait for them and give them a welcome to the\nParsonage, which was to be their temporary home.  The respectful\nservants, in deep mourning, had all prepared, and gave Ellinor a note\nfrom Mr. Brown, saying that he purposely refrained from disturbing them\nthat day after their long journey, but would call on the morrow, and tell\nthem of the arrangements he had thought of making, always subject to Miss\nWilkins's approval.\n\nThese were simple enough; certain legal forms to be gone through, any\nselection from books or furniture to be made, and the rest to be sold by\nauction as speedily as convenient, as the successor to the living might\nwish to have repairs and alterations effected in the old parsonage.  For\nsome days Ellinor employed herself in business in the house, never going\nout except to church.  Miss Monro, on the contrary, strolled about\neverywhere, noticing all the alterations in place and people, which were\nnever improvements in her opinion.  Ellinor had plenty of callers (her\ntenants, Mr. and Mrs. Osbaldistone among others), but, excepting in rare\ncases--most of them belonged to humble life--she declined to see every\none, as she had business enough on her hands: sixteen years makes a great\ndifference in any set of people.  The old acquaintances of her father in\nhis better days were almost all dead or removed; there were one or two\nremaining, and these Ellinor received; one or two more, old and infirm,\nconfined to their houses, she planned to call upon before leaving Hamley.\nEvery evening, when Dixon had done his work at Mr. Osbaldistone's, he\ncame up to the Parsonage, ostensibly to help her in moving or packing\nbooks, but really because these two clung to each other--were bound to\neach other by a bond never to be spoken about.  It was understood between\nthem that once before Ellinor left she should go and see the old place,\nFord Bank.  Not to go into the house, though Mr. and Mrs. Osbaldistone\nhad begged her to name her own time for revisiting it when they and their\nfamily would be absent, but to see all the gardens and grounds once more;\na solemn, miserable visit, which, because of the very misery it involved,\nappeared to Ellinor to be an imperative duty.\n\nDixon and she talked together as she sat making a catalogue one evening\nin the old low-browed library; the casement windows were open into the\ngarden, and the May showers had brought out the scents of the new-leaved\nsweetbriar bush just below.  Beyond the garden hedge the grassy meadows\nsloped away down to the river; the Parsonage was so much raised that,\nsitting in the house, you could see over the boundary hedge.  Men with\ninstruments were busy in the meadow.  Ellinor, pausing in her work, asked\nDixon what they were doing.\n\n\"Them's the people for the new railway,\" said he.  \"Nought would satisfy\nthe Hamley folk but to have a railway all to themselves--coaches isn't\ngood enough now-a-days.\"\n\nHe spoke with a tone of personal offence natural to a man who had passed\nall his life among horses, and considered railway-engines as their\ndespicable rivals, conquering only by stratagem.\n\nBy-and-by Ellinor passed on to a subject the consideration of which she\nhad repeatedly urged upon Dixon, and entreated him to come and form one\nof their household at East Chester.  He was growing old, she thought\nolder even in looks and feelings than in years, and she would make him\nhappy and comfortable in his declining years if he would but come and\npass them under her care.  The addition which Mr. Ness's bequest made to\nher income would enable her to do not only this, but to relieve Miss\nMonro of her occupation of teaching; which, at the years she had arrived\nat, was becoming burdensome.  When she proposed the removal to Dixon he\nshook his head.\n\n\"It's not that I don't thank you, and kindly, too; but I'm too old to go\nchopping and changing.\"\n\n\"But it would be no change to come back to me, Dixon,\" said Ellinor.\n\n\"Yes, it would.  I were born i' Hamley, and it's i' Hamley I reckon to\ndie.\"\n\nOn her urging him a little more, it came out that he had a strong feeling\nthat if he did not watch the spot where the dead man lay buried, the\nwhole would be discovered; and that this dread of his had often poisoned\nthe pleasure of his visit to East Chester.\n\n\"I don't rightly know how it is, for I sometimes think if it wasn't for\nyou, missy, I should be glad to have made it all clear before I go; and\nyet at times I dream, or it comes into my head as I lie awake with the\nrheumatics, that some one is there, digging; or that I hear 'em cutting\ndown the tree; and then I get up and look out of the loft window--you'll\nmind the window over the stables, as looks into the garden, all covered\nover wi' the leaves of the jargonelle pear-tree?  That were my room when\nfirst I come as stable-boy, and tho' Mr. Osbaldistone would fain give me\na warmer one, I allays tell him I like th' old place best.  And by times\nI've getten up five or six times a-night to make sure as there was no one\nat work under the tree.\"\n\nEllinor shivered a little.  He saw it, and restrained himself in the\nrelief he was receiving from imparting his superstitious fancies.\n\n\"You see, missy, I could never rest a-nights if I didn't feel as if I\nkept the secret in my hand, and held it tight day and night, so as I\ncould open my hand at any minute and see as it was there.  No! my own\nlittle missy will let me come and see her now and again, and I know as I\ncan allays ask her for what I want: and if it please God to lay me by, I\nshall tell her so, and she'll see as I want for nothing.  But somehow I\ncould ne'er bear leaving Hamley.  You shall come and follow me to my\ngrave when my time comes.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so, please, Dixon,\" said she.\n\n\"Nay, it'll be a mercy when I can lay me down and sleep in peace: though\nI sometimes fear as peace will not come to me even there.\"  He was going\nout of the room, and was now more talking to himself than to her.  \"They\nsay blood will out, and if it weren't for her part in it, I could wish\nfor a clear breast before I die.\"\n\nShe did not hear the latter part of this mumbled sentence.  She was\nlooking at a letter just brought in and requiring an immediate answer.  It\nwas from Mr. Brown.  Notes from him were of daily occurrence, but this\ncontained an open letter the writing of which was strangely familiar to\nher--it did not need the signature \"Ralph Corbet,\" to tell her whom the\nletter came from.  For some moments she could not read the words.  They\nexpressed a simple enough request, and were addressed to the auctioneer\nwho was to dispose of the rather valuable library of the late Mr. Ness,\nand whose name had been advertised in connection with the sale, in the\n_Athenaeum_, and other similar papers.  To him Mr. Corbet wrote, saying\nthat he should be unable to be present when the books were sold, but that\nhe wished to be allowed to buy in, at any price decided upon, a certain\nrare folio edition of _Virgil_, bound in parchment, and with notes in\nItalian.  The book was fully described.  Though no Latin scholar, Ellinor\nknew the book well--remembered its look from old times, and could\ninstantly have laid her hand upon it.  The auctioneer had sent the\nrequest onto his employer, Mr. Brown.  That gentleman applied to Ellinor\nfor her consent.  She saw that the fact of the intended sale must be all\nthat Mr. Corbet was aware of, and that he could not know to whom the\nbooks belonged.  She chose out the book, and wrapped and tied it up with\ntrembling hands.  _He_ might be the person to untie the knot.  It was\nstrangely familiar to her love, after so many years, to be brought into\nthus much contact with him.  She wrote a short note to Mr. Brown, in\nwhich she requested him to say, as though from himself; and without any\nmention of her name, that he, as executor, requested Mr. Corbet's\nacceptance of the _Virgil_, as a remembrance of his former friend and\ntutor.  Then she rang the bell, and gave the letter and parcel to the\nservant.\n\nAgain alone, and Mr. Corbet's open letter on the table.  She took it up\nand looked at it till the letters dazzled crimson on the white paper.  Her\nlife rolled backwards, and she was a girl again.  At last she roused\nherself; but instead of destroying the note--it was long years since all\nher love-letters from him had been returned to the writer--she unlocked\nher little writing-case again, and placed this letter carefully down at\nthe bottom, among the dead rose-leaves which embalmed the note from her\nfather, found after his death under his pillow, the little golden curl of\nher sister's, the half-finished sewing of her mother.\n\nThe shabby writing-case itself was given her by her father long ago, and\nhad since been taken with her everywhere.  To be sure, her changes of\nplace had been but few; but if she had gone to Nova Zembla, the sight of\nthat little leather box on awaking from her first sleep, would have given\nher a sense of home.  She locked the case up again, and felt all the\nricher for that morning.\n\nA day or two afterwards she left Hamley.  Before she went she compelled\nherself to go round the gardens and grounds of Ford Bank.  She had made\nMrs. Osbaldistone understand that it would be painful for her to re-enter\nthe house; but Mr. Osbaldistone accompanied her in her walk.\n\n\"You see how literally we have obeyed the clause in the lease which ties\nus out from any alterations,\" said he, smiling.  \"We are living in a\ntangled thicket of wood.  I must confess that I should have liked to cut\ndown a good deal; but we do not do even the requisite thinnings without\nmaking the proper application for leave to Mr. Johnson.  In fact, your\nold friend Dixon is jealous of every pea-stick the gardener cuts.  I\nnever met with so faithful a fellow.  A good enough servant, too, in his\nway; but somewhat too old-fashioned for my wife and daughters, who\ncomplain of his being surly now and then.\"\n\n\"You are not thinking of parting with him?\" said Ellinor, jealous for\nDixon.\n\n\"Oh, no; he and I are capital friends.  And I believe Mrs. Osbaldistone\nherself would never consent to his leaving us.  But some ladies, you\nknow, like a little more subserviency in manner than our friend Dixon can\nboast.\"\n\nEllinor made no reply.  They were entering the painted flower garden,\nhiding the ghastly memory.  She could not speak.  She felt as if, with\nall her striving, she could not move--just as one does in a nightmare--but\nshe was past the place even as this terror came to its acme; and when she\ncame to herself, Mr. Osbaldistone was still blandly talking, and saying--\n\n\"It is now a reward for our obedience to your wishes, Miss Wilkins, for\nif the projected railway passes through the ash-field yonder we should\nhave been perpetually troubled with the sight of the trains; indeed, the\nsound would have been much more distinct than it will be now coming\nthrough the interlacing branches.  Then you will not go in, Miss\nWilkins?\"  Mrs. Osbaldistone desired me to say how happy--\"Ah! I can\nunderstand such feelings--Certainly, certainly; it is so much the\nshortest way to the town, that we elder ones always go through the stable-\nyard; for young people, it is perhaps not quite so desirable.  Ha!\nDixon,\" he continued, \"on the watch for the Miss Ellinor we so often hear\nof!  This old man,\" he continued to Ellinor, \"is never satisfied with the\nseat of our young ladies, always comparing their way of riding with that\nof a certain missy--\"\n\n\"I cannot help it, sir; they've quite a different style of hand, and sit\nall lumpish-like.  Now, Miss Ellinor, there--\"\n\n\"Hush, Dixon,\" she said, suddenly aware of why the old servant was not\npopular with his mistress.  \"I suppose I may be allowed to ask for\nDixon's company for an hour or so; we have something to do together\nbefore we leave.\"\n\nThe consent given, the two walked away, as by previous appointment, to\nHamley churchyard, where he was to point out to her the exact spot where\nhe wished to be buried.  Trampling over the long, rank grass, but\navoiding passing directly over any of the thickly-strewn graves, he made\nstraight for one spot--a little space of unoccupied ground close by,\nwhere Molly, the pretty scullery-maid, lay:\n\n   Sacred to the Memory of\n      MARY GREAVES.\n   Born 1797.  Died 1818.\n   \"We part to meet again.\"\n\n\"I put this stone up over her with my first savings,\" said he, looking at\nit; and then, pulling out his knife, he began to clean out the letters.\n\"I said then as I would lie by her.  And it'll be a comfort to think\nyou'll see me laid here.  I trust no one'll be so crabbed as to take a\nfancy to this 'ere spot of ground.\"\n\nEllinor grasped eagerly at the only pleasure which her money enabled her\nto give to the old man: and promised him that she would take care and buy\nthe right to that particular piece of ground.  This was evidently a\ngratification Dixon had frequently yearned after; he kept saying, \"I'm\ngreatly obleeged to ye, Miss Ellinor.  I may say I'm truly obleeged.\"  And\nwhen he saw them off by the coach the next day, his last words were, \"I\ncannot justly say how greatly I'm obleeged to you for that matter of the\nchurchyard.\"  It was a much more easy affair to give Miss Monro some\nadditional comforts; she was as cheerful as ever; still working away at\nher languages in any spare time, but confessing that she was tired of the\nperpetual teaching in which her life had been spent during the last\nthirty years.  Ellinor was now enabled to set her at liberty from this,\nand she accepted the kindness from her former pupil with as much simple\ngratitude as that with which a mother receives a favour from a child.  \"If\nEllinor were but married to Canon Livingstone, I should be happier than I\nhave ever been since my father died,\" she used to say to herself in the\nsolitude of her bed-chamber, for talking aloud had become her wont in the\nearly years of her isolated life as a governess.  \"And yet,\" she went on,\n\"I don't know what I should do without her; it is lucky for me that\nthings are not in my hands, for a pretty mess I should make of them, one\nway or another.  Dear! how old Mrs. Cadogan used to hate that word\n'mess,' and correct her granddaughters for using it right before my face,\nwhen I knew I had said it myself only the moment before!  Well! those\ndays are all over now.  God be thanked!\"\n\nIn spite of being glad that \"things were not in her hands\" Miss Monro\ntried to take affairs into her charge by doing all she could to persuade\nEllinor to allow her to invite the canon to their \"little sociable teas.\"\nThe most provoking part was, that she was sure he would have come if he\nhad been asked; but she could never get leave to do so.  \"Of course no\nman could go on for ever and ever without encouragement,\" as she confided\nto herself in a plaintive tone of voice; and by-and-by many people were\nled to suppose that the bachelor canon was paying attention to Miss\nForbes, the eldest daughter of the family to which the delicate Jeanie\nbelonged.  It was, perhaps, with the Forbeses that both Miss Monro and\nEllinor were the most intimate of all the families in East Chester.  Mrs.\nForbes was a widow lady of good means, with a large family of pretty,\ndelicate daughters.  She herself belonged to one of the great houses in\n---shire, but had married into Scotland; so, after her husband's death,\nit was the most natural thing in the world that she should settle in East\nChester; and one after another of her daughters had become first Miss\nMonro's pupil and afterwards her friend.  Mrs. Forbes herself had always\nbeen strongly attracted by Ellinor, but it was long before she could\nconquer the timid reserve by which Miss Wilkins was hedged round.  It was\nMiss Monro, who was herself incapable of jealousy, who persevered in\npraising them to one another, and in bringing them together; and now\nEllinor was as intimate and familiar in Mrs. Forbes's household as she\never could be with any family not her own.\n\nMrs. Forbes was considered to be a little fanciful as to illness; but it\nwas no wonder, remembering how many sisters she had lost by consumption.\nMiss Monro had often grumbled at the way in which her pupils were made\nirregular for very trifling causes.  But no one so alarmed as she, when,\nin the autumn succeeding Mr. Ness's death, Mrs. Forbes remarked to her on\nEllinor's increased delicacy of appearance, and shortness of breathing.\nFrom that time forwards she worried Ellinor (if any one so sweet and\npatient could ever have been worried) with respirators and precautions.\nEllinor submitted to all her friend's wishes and cares, sooner than make\nher anxious, and remained a prisoner in the house through the whole of\nNovember.  Then Miss Monro's anxiety took another turn.  Ellinor's\nappetite and spirits failed her--not at all an unnatural consequence of\nso many weeks' confinement to the house.  A plan was started, quite\nsuddenly, one morning in December, that met with approval from everyone\nbut Ellinor, who was, however, by this time too languid to make much\nresistance.\n\nMrs. Forbes and her daughters were going to Rome for three or four\nmonths, so as to avoid the trying east winds of spring; why should not\nMiss Wilkins go with them?  They urged it, and Miss Monro urged it,\nthough with a little private sinking of the heart at the idea of the long\nseparation from one who was almost like a child to her.  Ellinor was, as\nit were, lifted off her feet and borne away by the unanimous opinion of\nothers--the doctor included--who decided that such a step was highly\ndesirable; if not absolutely necessary.  She knew that she had only a\nlife interest both in her father's property and in that bequeathed to her\nby Mr. Ness.  Hitherto she had not felt much troubled by this, as she had\nsupposed that in the natural course of events she should survive Miss\nMonro and Dixon, both of whom she looked upon as dependent upon her.  All\nshe had to bequeath to the two was the small savings, which would not\nnearly suffice for both purposes, especially considering that Miss Monro\nhad given up her teaching, and that both she and Dixon were passing into\nyears.\n\nBefore Ellinor left England she had made every arrangement for the\ncontingency of her death abroad that Mr. Johnson could suggest.  She had\nwritten and sent a long letter to Dixon; and a shorter one was left in\ncharge of Canon Livingstone (she dared not hint at the possibility of her\ndying to Miss Monro) to be sent to the old man.\n\nAs they drove out of the King's Cross station, they passed a gentleman's\ncarriage entering.  Ellinor saw a bright, handsome lady, a nurse, and\nbaby inside, and a gentleman sitting by them whose face she could never\nforget.  It was Mr. Corbet taking his wife and child to the railway.  They\nwere going on a Christmas visit to East Chester deanery.  He had been\nleaning back, not noticing the passers-by, not attending to the other\ninmates of the carriage, probably absorbed in the consideration of some\nlaw case.  Such were the casual glimpses Ellinor had of one with whose\nlife she had once thought herself bound up.\n\nWho so proud as Miss Monro when a foreign letter came?  Her correspondent\nwas not particularly graphic in her descriptions, nor were there any\nadventures to be described, nor was the habit of mind of Ellinor such as\nto make her clear and definite in her own impressions of what she saw,\nand her natural reserve kept her from being fluent in communicating them\neven to Miss Monro.  But that lady would have been pleased to read aloud\nthese letters to the assembled dean and canons, and would not have been\nsurprised if they had invited her to the chapter-house for that purpose.\nTo her circle of untravelled ladies, ignorant of Murray, but laudably\ndesirous of information, all Ellinor's historical reminiscences and\nrather formal details were really interesting.  There was no railroad in\nthose days between Lyons and Marseilles, so their progress was slow, and\nthe passage of letters to and fro, when they had arrived in Rome, long\nand uncertain.  But all seemed going on well.  Ellinor spoke of herself\nas in better health; and Canon Livingstone (between whom and Miss Monro\ngreat intimacy had sprung up since Ellinor had gone away, and Miss Monro\ncould ask him to tea) confirmed this report of Miss Wilkins's health from\na letter which he had received from Mrs. Forbes.  Curiosity about that\nletter was Miss Monro's torment.  What could they have had to write to\neach other about?  It was a very odd proceeding; although the\nLivingstones and Forbeses were distantly related, after the manner of\nScotland.  Could it have been that he had offered to Euphemia, after all,\nand that her mother had answered; or, possibly, there was a letter from\nEffie herself, enclosed.  It was a pity for Miss Monro's peace of mind\nthat she did not ask him straight away.  She would then have learnt what\nCanon Livingstone had no thought of concealing, that Mrs. Forbes had\nwritten solely to give him some fuller directions about certain charities\nthan she had had time to think about in the hurry of starting.  As it\nwas, and when, a little later on, she heard him speak of the possibility\nof his going himself to Rome, as soon as his term of residence was over,\nin time for the Carnival, she gave up her fond project in despair, and\nfelt very much like a child whose house of bricks had been knocked down\nby the unlucky waft of some passing petticoat.\n\nMeanwhile, the entire change of scene brought on the exquisite\nrefreshment of entire change of thought.  Ellinor had not been able so\ncompletely to forget her past life for many years; it was like a renewing\nof her youth; cut so suddenly short by the shears of Fate.  Ever since\nthat night, she had had to rouse herself on awakening in the morning into\na full comprehension of the great cause she had for much fear and heavy\ngrief.  Now, when she wakened in her little room, fourth piano, No. 36,\nBabuino, she saw the strange, pretty things around her, and her mind went\noff into pleasant wonder and conjecture, happy recollections of the day\nbefore, and pleasant anticipations of the day to come.  Latent in Ellinor\nwas her father's artistic temperament; everything new and strange was a\npicture and a delight; the merest group in the street, a Roman facchino,\nwith his cloak draped over his shoulder, a girl going to market or\ncarrying her pitcher back from the fountain, everything and every person\nthat presented it or himself to her senses, gave them a delicious shock,\nas if it were something strangely familiar from Pinelli, but unseen by\nher mortal eyes before.  She forgot her despondency, her ill-health\ndisappeared as if by magic; the Misses Forbes, who had taken the pensive,\ndrooping invalid as a companion out of kindness of heart, found\nthemselves amply rewarded by the sight of her amended health, and her\nkeen enjoyment of everything, and the half-quaint, half naive expressions\nof her pleasure.\n\nSo March came round; Lent was late that year.  The great nosegays of\nviolets and camellias were for sale at the corner of the Condotti, and\nthe revellers had no difficulty in procuring much rarer flowers for the\nbelles of the Corso.  The embassies had their balconies; the attaches of\nthe Russian Embassy threw their light and lovely presents at every pretty\ngirl, or suspicion of a pretty girl, who passed slowly in her carriage,\ncovered over with her white domino, and holding her wire mask as a\nprotection to her face from the showers of lime confetti, which otherwise\nwould have been enough to blind her; Mrs. Forbes had her own hired\nbalcony, as became a wealthy and respectable Englishwoman.  The girls had\na great basket full of bouquets with which to pelt their friends in the\ncrowd below; a store of moccoletti lay piled on the table behind, for it\nwas the last day of Carnival, and as soon as dusk came on the tapers were\nto be lighted, to be as quickly extinguished by every means in everyone's\npower.  The crowd below was at its wildest pitch; the rows of stately\ncontadini alone sitting immovable as their possible ancestors, the\nsenators who received Brennus and his Gauls.  Masks and white dominoes,\nforeign gentlemen, and the riffraff of the city, slow-driving carriages,\nshowers of flowers, most of them faded by this time, everyone shouting\nand struggling at that wild pitch of excitement which may so soon turn\ninto fury.  The Forbes girls had given place at the window to their\nmother and Ellinor, who were gazing half amused, half terrified, at the\nmad parti-coloured movement below; when a familiar face looked up,\nsmiling a recognition; and \"How shall I get to you?\" was asked in\nEnglish, by the well-known voice of Canon Livingstone.  They saw him\ndisappear under the balcony on which they were standing, but it was some\ntime before he made his appearance in their room.  And when he did, he\nwas almost overpowered with greetings; so glad were they to see an East\nChester face.\n\n\"When did you come?  Where are you?  What a pity you did not come sooner!\nIt is so long since we have heard anything; do tell us everything!  It is\nthree weeks since we have had any letters; those tiresome boats have been\nso irregular because of the weather.\"  \"How was everybody--Miss Monro in\nparticular?\" Ellinor asks.\n\nHe, quietly smiling, replied to their questions by slow degrees.  He had\nonly arrived the night before, and had been hunting for them all day; but\nno one could give him any distinct intelligence as to their whereabouts\nin all the noise and confusion of the place, especially as they had their\nonly English servant with them, and the canon was not strong in his\nItalian.  He was not sorry he had missed all but this last day of\ncarnival, for he was half blinded and wholly deafened, as it was.  He was\nat the \"Angleterre;\" he had left East Chester about a week ago; he had\nletters for all of them, but had not dared to bring them through the\ncrowd for fear of having his pocket picked.  Miss Monro was very well,\nbut very uneasy at not having heard from Ellinor for so long; the\nirregularity of the boats must be telling both ways, for their English\nfriends were full of wonder at not hearing from Rome.  And then followed\nsome well-deserved abuse of the Roman post, and some suspicion of the\ncarelessness with which Italian servants posted English letters.  All\nthese answers were satisfactory enough, yet Mrs. Forbes thought she saw a\nlatent uneasiness in Canon Livingstone's manner, and fancied once or\ntwice that he hesitated in replying to Ellinor's questions.  But there\nwas no being quite sure in the increasing darkness, which prevented\ncountenances from being seen; nor in the constant interruptions and\nscreams which were going on in the small crowded room, as wafting\nhandkerchiefs, puffs of wind, or veritable extinguishers, fastened to\nlong sticks, and coming from nobody knew where, put out taper after taper\nas fast as they were lighted.\n\n\"You will come home with us,\" said Mrs. Forbes.  \"I can only offer you\ncold meat with tea; our cook is gone out, this being a universal festa;\nbut we cannot part with an old friend for any scruples as to the\ncommissariat.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  I should have invited myself if you had not been good enough\nto ask me.\"\n\nWhen they had all arrived at their apartment in the Babuino (Canon\nLivingstone had gone round to fetch the letters with which he was\nentrusted), Mrs. Forbes was confirmed in her supposition that he had\nsomething particular and not very pleasant to say to Ellinor, by the\nrather grave and absent manner in which he awaited her return from taking\noff her out-of-door things.  He broke off, indeed, in his conversation\nwith Mrs. Forbes to go and meet Ellinor, and to lead her into the most\ndistant window before he delivered her letters.\n\n\"From what you said in the balcony yonder, I fear you have not received\nyour home letters regularly?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied she, startled and trembling, she hardly knew why.\n\n\"No more has Miss Monro heard from you; nor, I believe, has some one else\nwho expected to hear.  Your man of business--I forget his name.\"\n\n\"My man of business!  Something has gone wrong, Mr. Livingstone.  Tell\nme--I want to know.  I have been expecting it--only tell me.\"  She sat\ndown suddenly, as white as ashes.\n\n\"Dear Miss Wilkins, I'm afraid it is painful enough, but you are fancying\nit worse than it is.  All your friends are quite well; but an old\nservant--\"\n\n\"Well!\" she said, seeing his hesitation, and leaning forwards and griping\nat his arm.\n\n\"Is taken up on a charge of manslaughter or murder.  Oh! Mrs. Forbes,\ncome here!\"\n\nFor Ellinor had fainted, falling forwards on the arm she had held.  When\nshe came round she was lying half undressed on her bed; they were giving\nher tea in spoonfuls.\n\n\"I must get up,\" she moaned.  \"I must go home.\"\n\n\"You must lie still,\" said Mrs. Forbes, firmly.\n\n\"You don't know.  I must go home,\" she repeated; and she tried to sit up,\nbut fell back helpless.  Then she did not speak, but lay and thought.\n\"Will you bring me some meat?\" she whispered.  \"And some wine?\"  They\nbrought her meat and wine; she ate, though she was choking.  \"Now,\nplease, bring me my letters, and leave me alone; and after that I should\nlike to speak to Canon Livingstone.  Don't let him go, please.  I won't\nbe long--half an hour, I think.  Only let me be alone.\"\n\nThere was a hurried feverish sharpness in her tone that made Mrs. Forbes\nvery anxious, but she judged it best to comply with her requests.\n\nThe letters were brought, the lights were arranged so that she could read\nthem lying on her bed; and they left her.  Then she got up and stood on\nher feet, dizzy enough, her arms clasped at the top of her head, her eyes\ndilated and staring as if looking at some great horror.  But after a few\nminutes she sat down suddenly, and began to read.  Letters were evidently\nmissing.  Some had been sent by an opportunity that had been delayed on\nthe journey, and had not yet arrived in Rome.  Others had been despatched\nby the post, but the severe weather, the unusual snow, had, in those\ndays, before the railway was made between Lyons and Marseilles, put a\nstop to many a traveller's plans, and had rendered the transmission of\nthe mail extremely uncertain; so, much of that intelligence which Miss\nMonro had evidently considered as certain to be known to Ellinor was\nentirely matter of conjecture, and could only be guessed at from what was\ntold in these letters.  One was from Mr. Johnson, one from Mr. Brown, one\nfrom Miss Monro; of course the last mentioned was the first read.  She\nspoke of the shock of the discovery of Mr. Dunster's body, found in the\ncutting of the new line of railroad from Hamley to the nearest railway\nstation; the body so hastily buried long ago, in its clothes, by which it\nwas now recognised--a recognition confirmed by one or two more personal\nand indestructible things, such as his watch and seal with his initials;\nof the shock to everyone, the Osbaldistones in particular, on the further\ndiscovery of a fleam or horse-lancet, having the name of Abraham Dixon\nengraved on the handle; how Dixon had gone on Mr. Osbaldistone's business\nto a horse-fair in Ireland some weeks before this, and had had his leg\nbroken by a kick from an unruly mare, so that he was barely able to move\nabout when the officers of justice went to apprehend him in Tralee.\n\nAt this point Ellinor cried out loud and shrill.\n\n\"Oh, Dixon! Dixon! and I was away enjoying myself.\"\n\nThey heard her cry, and came to the door, but it was bolted inside.\n\n\"Please, go away,\" she said; \"please, go.  I will be very quiet; only,\nplease, go.\"\n\nShe could not bear just then to read any more of Miss Monro's letter; she\ntore open Mr. Johnson's--the date was a fortnight earlier than Miss\nMonro's; he also expressed his wonder at not hearing from her, in reply\nto his letter of January 9; but he added, that he thought that her\ntrustees had judged rightly; the handsome sum the railway company had\noffered for the land when their surveyor decided on the alteration of the\nline, Mr. Osbaldistone, &c. &c.  She could not read anymore; it was Fate\npursuing her.  Then she took the letter up again and tried to read; but\nall that reached her understanding was the fact that Mr. Johnson had sent\nhis present letter to Miss Monro, thinking that she might know of some\nprivate opportunity safer than the post.  Mr. Brown's was just such a\nletter as he occasionally sent her from time to time; a correspondence\nthat arose out of their mutual regard for their dead friend Mr. Ness.  It,\ntoo, had been sent to Miss Monro to direct.  Ellinor was on the point of\nputting it aside entirely, when the name of Corbet caught her eye: \"You\nwill be interested to hear that the old pupil of our departed friend, who\nwas so anxious to obtain the folio _Virgil_ with the Italian notes, is\nappointed the new judge in room of Mr. Justice Jenkin.  At least I\nconclude that Mr. Ralph Corbet, Q.C., is the same as the _Virgil_\nfancier.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ellinor, bitterly; \"he judged well; it would never have\ndone.\"  They were the first words of anything like reproach which she\never formed in her own mind during all these years.  She thought for a\nfew moments of the old times; it seemed to steady her brain to think of\nthem.  Then she took up and finished Miss Monro's letter.  That excellent\nfriend had done all which she thought Ellinor would have wished without\ndelay.  She had written to Mr. Johnson, and charged him to do everything\nhe could to defend Dixon and to spare no expense.  She was thinking of\ngoing to the prison in the county town, to see the old man herself, but\nEllinor could perceive that all these endeavours and purposes of Miss\nMonro's were based on love for her own pupil, and a desire to set her\nmind at ease as far as she could, rather than from any idea that Dixon\nhimself could be innocent.  Ellinor put down the letters, and went to the\ndoor, then turned back, and locked them up in her writing-case with\ntrembling hands; and after that she entered the drawing-room, looking\nliker to a ghost than to a living woman.\n\n\"Can I speak to you for a minute alone?\"  Her still, tuneless voice made\nthe words into a command.  Canon Livingstone arose and followed her into\nthe little dining-room.  \"Will you tell me all you know--all you have\nheard about my--you know what?\"\n\n\"Miss Monro was my informant--at least at first--it was in the _Times_\nthe day before I left.  Miss Monro says it could only have been done in a\nmoment of anger if the old servant is really guilty; that he was as\nsteady and good a man as she ever knew, and she seems to have a strong\nfeeling against Mr. Dunster, as always giving your father much\nunnecessary trouble; in fact, she hints that his disappearance at the\ntime was supposed to be the cause of a considerable loss of property to\nMr. Wilkins.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Ellinor, eagerly, feeling that some justice ought to be done\nto the dead man; and then she stopped short, fearful of saying anything\nthat should betray her full knowledge.  \"I mean this,\" she went on; \"Mr.\nDunster was a very disagreeable man personally--and papa--we none of us\nliked him; but he was quite honest--please remember that.\"\n\nThe canon bowed, and said a few acquiescing words.  He waited for her to\nspeak again.\n\n\"Miss Monro says she is going to see Dixon in--\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Livingstone, I can't bear it!\"\n\nHe let her alone, looking at her pitifully, as she twisted and wrung her\nhands together in her endeavour to regain the quiet manner she had\nstriven to maintain through the interview.  She looked up at him with a\npoor attempt at an apologetic smile:\n\n\"It is so terrible to think of that good old man in prison!\"\n\n\"You do not believe him guilty!\" said Canon Livingstone, in some\nsurprise.  \"I am afraid, from all I heard and read, there is but little\ndoubt that he did kill the man; I trust in some moment of irritation,\nwith no premeditated malice.\"\n\nEllinor shook her head.\n\n\"How soon can I get to England?\" asked she.  \"I must start at once.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Forbes sent out while you were lying down.  I am afraid there is no\nboat to Marseilles till Thursday, the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But I must go sooner!\" said Ellinor, starting up.  \"I must go; please\nhelp me.  He may be tried before I can get there!\"\n\n\"Alas!  I fear that will be the case, whatever haste you make.  The trial\nwas to come on at the Hellingford Assizes, and that town stands first on\nthe Midland Circuit list.  To-day is the 27th of February; the assizes\nbegin on the 7th of March.\"\n\n\"I will start to-morrow morning early for Civita; there may be a boat\nthere they do not know of here.  At any rate, I shall be on my way.  If\nhe dies, I must die too.  Oh!  I don't know what I am saying, I am so\nutterly crushed down!  It would be such a kindness if you would go away,\nand let no one come to me.  I know Mrs. Forbes is so good, she will\nforgive me.  I will say good-by to you all before I go to-morrow morning;\nbut I must think now.\"\n\nFor one moment he stood looking at her as if he longed to comfort her by\nmore words.  He thought better of it, however, and silently left the\nroom.\n\nFor a long time Ellinor sat still; now and then taking up Miss Monro's\nletter, and re-reading the few terrible details.  Then she bethought her\nthat possibly the canon might have brought a copy of the _Times_,\ncontaining the examination of Dixon before the magistrates, and she\nopened the door and called to a passing servant to make the inquiry.  She\nwas quite right in her conjecture; Dr. Livingstone had had the paper in\nhis pocket during his interview with her; but he thought the evidence so\nconclusive, that the perusal of it would only be adding to her extreme\ndistress by accelerating the conviction of Dixon's guilt, which he\nbelieved she must arrive at sooner or later.\n\nHe had been reading the report over with Mrs. Forbes and her daughters,\nafter his return from Ellinor's room, and they were all participating in\nhis opinion upon it, when her request for the _Times_ was brought.  They\nhad reluctantly agreed, saying there did not appear to be a shadow of\ndoubt on the fact of Dixon's having killed Mr. Dunster, only hoping there\nmight prove to be some extenuating circumstances, which Ellinor had\nprobably recollected, and which she was desirous of producing on the\napproaching trial.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nEllinor, having read the report of Dixon's examination in the newspaper,\nbathed her eyes and forehead in cold water, and tried to still her poor\nheart's beating, that she might be clear and collected enough to weigh\nthe evidence.\n\nEvery line of it was condemnatory.  One or two witnesses spoke of Dixon's\nunconcealed dislike of Dunster, a dislike which Ellinor knew had been\nentertained by the old servant out of a species of loyalty to his master,\nas well as from personal distaste.  The fleam was proved beyond all doubt\nto be Dixon's; and a man, who had been stable-boy in Mr. Wilkins's\nservice, swore that on the day when Mr. Dunster was missed, and when the\nwhole town was wondering what had become of him, a certain colt of Mr.\nWilkins's had needed bleeding, and that he had been sent by Dixon to the\nfarrier's for a horse-lancet, an errand which he had remarked upon at the\ntime, as he knew that Dixon had a fleam of his own.\n\nMr. Osbaldistone was examined.  He kept interrupting himself perpetually\nto express his surprise at the fact of so steady and well-conducted a man\nas Dixon being guilty of so heinous a crime, and was willing enough to\ntestify to the excellent character which he had borne during all the many\nyears he had been in his (Mr. Osbaldistone's) service; but he appeared to\nbe quite convinced by the evidence previously given of the prisoner's\nguilt in the matter, and strengthened the case against him materially by\nstating the circumstance of the old man's dogged unwillingness to have\nthe slightest interference by cultivation with that particular piece of\nground.\n\nHere Ellinor shuddered.  Before her, in that Roman bed-chamber, rose the\nfatal oblong she knew by heart--a little green moss or lichen, and thinly-\ngrowing blades of grass scarcely covering the caked and undisturbed soil\nunder the old tree.  Oh, that she had been in England when the surveyors\nof the railway between Ashcombe and Hamley had altered their line; she\nwould have entreated, implored, compelled her trustees not to have sold\nthat piece of ground for any sum of money whatever.  She would have\nbribed the surveyors, done she knew not what--but now it was too late;\nshe would not let her mind wander off to what might have been; she would\nforce herself again to attend to the newspaper columns.  There was little\nmore: the prisoner had been asked if he could say anything to clear\nhimself, and properly cautioned not to say anything to incriminate\nhimself.  The poor old man's person was described, and his evident\nemotion.  \"The prisoner was observed to clutch at the rail before him to\nsteady himself, and his colour changed so much at this part of the\nevidence that one of the turnkeys offered him a glass of water, which he\ndeclined.  He is a man of a strongly-built frame, and with rather a\nmorose and sullen cast of countenance.\"\n\n\"My poor, poor Dixon!\" said Ellinor, laying down the paper for an\ninstant, and she was near crying, only she had resolved to shed no tears\ntill she had finished all, and could judge of the chances.  There were\nbut a few lines more: \"At one time the prisoner seemed to be desirous of\nalleging something in his defence, but he changed his mind, if such had\nbeen the case, and in reply to Mr. Gordon (the magistrate) he only said,\n'You've made a pretty strong case out again me, gentlemen, and it seems\nfor to satisfy you; so I think I'll not disturb your minds by saying\nanything more.'  Accordingly, Dixon now stands committed for trial for\nmurder at the next Hellingford Assizes, which commence on March the\nseventh, before Baron Rushton and Mr. Justice Corbet.\"\n\n\"Mr. Justice Corbet!\"  The words ran through Ellinor as though she had\nbeen stabbed with a knife, and by an irrepressible movement she stood up\nrigid.  The young man, her lover in her youth, the old servant who in\nthose days was perpetually about her--the two who had so often met in\nfamiliar if not friendly relations, now to face each other as judge and\naccused!  She could not tell how much Mr. Corbet had conjectured from the\npartial revelation she had made to him of the impending shame that hung\nover her and hers.  A day or two ago she could have remembered the exact\nwords she had used in that memorable interview; but now, strive as she\nwould, she could only recall facts, not words.  After all, the Mr.\nJustice Corbet might not be Ralph.  There was one chance in a hundred\nagainst the identity of the two.\n\nWhile she was weighing probabilities in her sick dizzy mind, she heard\nsoft steps outside her bolted door, and low voices whispering.  It was\nthe bedtime of happy people with hearts at ease.  Some of the footsteps\npassed lightly on; but there was a gentle rap at Ellinor's door.  She\npressed her two hot hands hard against her temples for an instant before\nshe went to open the door.  There stood Mrs. Forbes in her handsome\nevening dress, holding a lighted lamp in her hand.\n\n\"May I come in, my dear?\" she asked.  Ellinor's stiff dry lips refused to\nutter the words of assent which indeed did not come readily from her\nheart.\n\n\"I am so grieved at this sad news which the canon brings.  I can well\nunderstand what a shock it must be to you; we have just been saying it\nmust be as bad for you as it would be to us if our old Donald should turn\nout to have been a hidden murderer all these years that he has lived with\nus; I really could have as soon suspected Donald as that white-haired\nrespectable old man who used to come and see you at East Chester.\"\n\nEllinor felt that she must say something.  \"It is a terrible shock--poor\nold man! and no friend near him, even Mr. Osbaldistone giving evidence\nagain him.  Oh, dear, dear! why did I ever come to Rome?\"\n\n\"Now, my dear, you must not let yourself take an exaggerated view of the\ncase.  Sad and shocking as it is to have been so deceived, it is what\nhappens to many of us, though not to so terrible a degree; and as to your\ncoming to Rome having anything to do with it--\"\n\n(Mrs. Forbes almost smiled at the idea, so anxious was she to banish the\nidea of self-reproach from Ellinor's sensitive mind, but Ellinor\ninterrupted her abruptly:)\n\n\"Mrs. Forbes! did he--did Canon Livingstone tell you that I must leave to-\nmorrow?  I must go to England as fast as possible to do what I can for\nDixon.\"\n\n\"Yes, he told us you were thinking of it, and it was partly that made me\nforce myself in upon you to-night.  I think, my love, you are mistaken in\nfeeling as if you were called upon to do more than what the canon tells\nme Miss Monro has already done in your name--engaged the best legal\nadvice, and spared no expense to give the suspected man every chance.\nWhat could you do more even if you were on the spot?  And it is very\npossible that the trial may have come on before you get home.  Then what\ncould you do?  He would either have been acquitted or condemned; if the\nformer, he would find public sympathy all in his favour; it always is for\nthe unjustly accused.  And if he turns out to be guilty, my dear Ellinor,\nit will be far better for you to have all the softening which distance\ncan give to such a dreadful termination to the life of a poor man whom\nyou have respected so long.\"\n\nBut Ellinor spoke again with a kind of irritated determination, very\nforeign to her usual soft docility:\n\n\"Please just let me judge for myself this once.  I am not ungrateful.  God\nknows I don't want to vex one who has been so kind to me as you have\nbeen, dear Mrs. Forbes; but I must go--and every word you say to dissuade\nme only makes me more convinced.  I am going to Civita to-morrow.  I\nshall be that much on the way.  I cannot rest here.\"\n\nMrs. Forbes looked at her in grave silence.  Ellinor could not bear the\nconsciousness of that fixed gaze.  Yet its fixity only arose from Mrs.\nForbes' perplexity as to how best to assist Ellinor, whether to restrain\nher by further advice--of which the first dose had proved so useless--or\nto speed her departure.  Ellinor broke on her meditations:\n\n\"You have always been so kind and good to me,--go on being so--please,\ndo!  Leave me alone now, dear Mrs. Forbes, for I cannot bear talking\nabout it, and help me to go to-morrow, and you do not know how I will\npray to God to bless you!\"\n\nSuch an appeal was irresistible.  Mrs. Forbes kissed her very tenderly,\nand went to rejoin her daughters, who were clustered together in their\nmother's bedroom awaiting her coming.\n\n\"Well, mamma, how is she?  What does she say?\"\n\n\"She is in a very excited state, poor thing! and has got so strong an\nimpression that it is her duty to go back to England and do all she can\nfor this wretched old man, that I am afraid we must not oppose her.  I am\nafraid that she really must go on Thursday.\"\n\nAlthough Mrs. Forbes secured the services of a travelling-maid, Dr.\nLivingstone insisted on accompanying Ellinor to England, and it would\nhave required more energy than she possessed at this time to combat a\nresolution which both words and manner expressed as determined.  She\nwould much rather have travelled alone with her maid; she did not feel\nthe need of the services he offered; but she was utterly listless and\nbroken down; all her interest was centred in the thought of Dixon and his\napproaching trial, and perplexity as to the mode in which she must do her\nduty.\n\nThey embarked late that evening in the tardy _Santa Lucia_, and Ellinor\nimmediately went to her berth.  She was not sea-sick; that might possibly\nhave lessened her mental sufferings, which all night long tormented her.\nHigh-perched in an upper berth, she did not like disturbing the other\noccupants of the cabin till daylight appeared.  Then she descended and\ndressed, and went on deck; the vessel was just passing the rocky coast of\nElba, and the sky was flushed with rosy light, that made the shadows on\nthe island of the most exquisite purple.  The sea still heaved with\nyesterday's storm, but the motion only added to the beauty of the\nsparkles and white foam that dimpled and curled on the blue waters.  The\nair was delicious, after the closeness of the cabin, and Ellinor only\nwondered that more people were not on deck to enjoy it.  One or two\nstragglers came up, time after time, and began pacing the deck.  Dr.\nLivingstone came up before very long; but he seemed to have made a rule\nof not obtruding himself on Ellinor, excepting when he could be of some\nuse.  After a few words of common-place morning greeting, he, too, began\nto walk backwards and forwards, while Ellinor sat quietly watching the\nlovely island receding fast from her view--a beautiful vision never to be\nseen again by her mortal eyes.\n\nSuddenly there was a shock and stound all over the vessel, her progress\nwas stopped, and a rocking vibration was felt everywhere.  The quarter-\ndeck was filled with blasts of steam, which obscured everything.  Sick\npeople came rushing up out of their berths in strange undress; the\nsteerage passengers--a motley and picturesque set of people, in many\nvarieties of gay costume--took refuge on the quarter-deck, speaking\nloudly in all varieties of French and Italian _patois_.  Ellinor stood up\nin silent, wondering dismay.  Was the _Santa Lucia_ going down on the\ngreat deep, and Dixon unaided in his peril?  Dr. Livingstone was by her\nside in a moment.  She could scarcely see him for the vapour, nor hear\nhim for the roar of the escaping steam.\n\n\"Do not be unnecessarily frightened,\" he repeated, a little louder.  \"Some\naccident has occurred to the engines.  I will go and make instant\ninquiry, and come back to you as soon as I can.  Trust to me.\"\n\nHe came back to where she sat trembling.\n\n\"A part of the engine is broken, through the carelessness of these\nNeapolitan engineers; they say we must make for the nearest port--return\nto Civita, in fact.\"\n\n\"But Elba is not many miles away,\" said Ellinor.  \"If this steam were but\naway, you could see it still.\"\n\n\"And if we were landed there we might stay on the island for many days;\nno steamer touches there; but if we return to Civita, we shall be in time\nfor the Sunday boat.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, dear!\" said Ellinor.  \"To-day is the second--Sunday will be\nthe fourth--the assizes begin on the seventh; how miserably unfortunate!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" he said, \"it is.  And these things always appear so doubly\nunfortunate when they hinder our serving others!  But it does not follow\nthat because the assizes begin at Hellingford on the seventh, Dixon's\ntrial will come on so soon.  We may still get to Marseilles on Monday\nevening; on by diligence to Lyons; it will--it must, I fear, be Thursday,\nat the earliest, before we reach Paris--Thursday, the eighth--and I\nsuppose you know of some exculpatory evidence that has to be hunted up?\"\n\nHe added this unwillingly; for he saw that Ellinor was jealous of the\nsecresy she had hitherto maintained as to her reasons for believing Dixon\ninnocent; but he could not help thinking that she, a gentle, timid woman,\nunaccustomed to action or business, would require some of the assistance\nwhich he would have been so thankful to give her; especially as this\nuntoward accident would increase the press of time in which what was to\nbe done would have to be done.\n\nBut no.  Ellinor scarcely replied to his half-inquiry as to her reasons\nfor hastening to England.  She yielded to all his directions, agreed to\nhis plans, but gave him none of her confidence, and he had to submit to\nthis exclusion from sympathy in the exact causes of her anxiety.\n\nOnce more in the dreary sala, with the gaudy painted ceiling, the bare\ndirty floor, the innumerable rattling doors and windows!  Ellinor was\nsubmissive and patient in demeanour, because so sick and despairing at\nheart.  Her maid was ten times as demonstrative of annoyance and disgust;\nshe who had no particular reason for wanting to reach England, but who\nthought it became her dignity to make it seem as though she had.\n\nAt length the weary time was over; and again they sailed past Elba, and\narrived at Marseilles.  Now Ellinor began to feel how much assistance it\nwas to her to have Dr. Livingstone for a \"courier,\" as he had several\ntimes called himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n\"Where now?\" said the canon, as they approached the London Bridge\nstation.\n\n\"To the Great Western,\" said she; \"Hellingford is on that line, I see.\nBut, please, now we must part.\"\n\n\"Then I may not go with you to Hellingford?  At any rate, you will allow\nme to go with you to the railway station, and do my last office as\ncourier in getting you your ticket and placing you in the carriage.\"\n\nSo they went together to the station, and learnt that no train was\nleaving for Hellingford for two hours.  There was nothing for it but to\ngo to the hotel close by, and pass away the time as best they could.\n\nEllinor called for her maid's accounts, and dismissed her.  Some\nrefreshment that the canon had ordered was eaten, and the table cleared.\nHe began walking up and down the room, his arms folded, his eyes cast\ndown.  Every now and then he looked at the clock on the mantelpiece.  When\nthat showed that it only wanted a quarter of an hour to the time\nappointed for the train to start, he came up to Ellinor, who sat leaning\nher head upon her hand, her hand resting on the table.\n\n\"Miss Wilkins,\" he began--and there was something peculiar in his tone\nwhich startled Ellinor--\"I am sure you will not scruple to apply to me if\nin any possible way I can help you in this sad trouble of yours?\"\n\n\"No indeed I won't!\" said Ellinor, gratefully, and putting out her hand\nas a token.  He took it, and held it; she went on, a little more hastily\nthan before: \"You know you were so good as to say you would go at once\nand see Miss Monro, and tell her all you know, and that I will write to\nher as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"May I not ask for one line?\" he continued, still holding her hand.\n\n\"Certainly: so kind a friend as you shall hear all I can tell; that is,\nall I am at liberty to tell.\"\n\n\"A friend!  Yes, I am a friend; and I will not urge any other claim just\nnow.  Perhaps--\"\n\nEllinor could not affect to misunderstand him.  His manner implied even\nmore than his words.\n\n\"No!\" she said, eagerly.  \"We are friends.  That is it.  I think we shall\nalways be friends, though I will tell you now--something--this much--it\nis a sad secret.  God help me!  I am as guilty as poor Dixon, if, indeed,\nhe is guilty--but he is innocent--indeed he is!\"\n\n\"If he is no more guilty than you, I am sure he is!  Let me be more than\nyour friend, Ellinor--let me know all, and help you all that I can, with\nthe right of an affianced husband.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said she, frightened both at what she had revealed, and his\neager, warm, imploring manner.  \"That can never be.  You do not know the\ndisgrace that may be hanging over me.\"\n\n\"If that is all,\" said he, \"I take my risk--if that is all--if you only\nfear that I may shrink from sharing any peril you may be exposed to.\"\n\n\"It is not peril--it is shame and obloquy--\" she murmured.\n\n\"Well! shame and obloquy.  Perhaps, if I knew all I could shield you from\nit.\"\n\n\"Don't, pray, speak any more about it now; if you do, I must say 'No.'\"\n\nShe did not perceive the implied encouragement in these words; but he\ndid, and they sufficed to make him patient.\n\nThe time was up, and he could only render her his last services as\n\"courier,\" and none other but the necessary words at starting passed\nbetween them.\n\nBut he went away from the station with a cheerful heart; while she,\nsitting alone and quiet, and at last approaching near to the place where\nso much was to be decided, felt sadder and sadder, heavier and heavier.\n\nAll the intelligence she had gained since she had seen the _Galignani_ in\nParis, had been from the waiter at the Great Western Hotel, who, after\nreturning from a vain search for an unoccupied _Times_, had volunteered\nthe information that there was an unusual demand for the paper because of\nHellingford Assizes, and the trial there for murder that was going on.\n\nThere was no electric telegraph in those days; at every station Ellinor\nput her head out, and enquired if the murder trial at Hellingford was\nended.  Some porters told her one thing, some another, in their hurry;\nshe felt that she could not rely on them.\n\n\"Drive to Mr. Johnson's in the High street--quick, quick.  I will give\nyou half-a-crown if you will go quick.\"\n\nFor, indeed, her endurance, her patience, was strained almost to\nsnapping; yet at Hellingford station, where doubtless they could have\ntold her the truth, she dared not ask the question.  It was past eight\no'clock at night.  In many houses in the little country town there were\nunusual lights and sounds.  The inhabitants were showing their\nhospitality to such of the strangers brought by the assizes, as were\nlingering there now that the business which had drawn them was over.  The\nJudges had left the town that afternoon, to wind up the circuit by the\nshort list of a neighbouring county town.\n\nMr. Johnson was entertaining a dinner-party of attorneys when he was\nsummoned from dessert by the announcement of a \"lady who wanted to speak\nto him immediate and particular.\"\n\nHe went into his study in not the best of tempers.  There he found his\nclient, Miss Wilkins, white and ghastly, standing by the fireplace, with\nher eyes fixed on the door.\n\n\"It is you, Miss Wilkins!  I am very glad--\"\n\n\"Dixon!\" said she.  It was all she could utter.\n\nMr. Johnson shook his head.\n\n\"Ah; that's a sad piece of business, and I'm afraid it has shortened your\nvisit at Rome.\"\n\n\"Is he--?\"\n\n\"Ay, I'm afraid there's no doubt of his guilt.  At any rate, the jury\nfound him guilty, and--\"\n\n\"And!\" she repeated, quickly, sitting down, the better to hear the words\nthat she knew were coming--\n\n\"He is condemned to death.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"The Saturday but one after the Judges left the town, I suppose--it's the\nusual time.\"\n\n\"Who tried him?\"\n\n\"Judge Corbet; and, for a new judge, I must say I never knew one who got\nthrough his business so well.  It was really as much as I could stand to\nhear him condemning the prisoner to death.  Dixon was undoubtedly guilty,\nand he was as stubborn as could be--a sullen old fellow who would let no\none help him through.  I'm sure I did my best for him at Miss Monro's\ndesire and for your sake.  But he would furnish me with no particulars,\nhelp us to no evidence.  I had the hardest work to keep him from\nconfessing all before witnesses, who would have been bound to repeat it\nas evidence against him.  Indeed, I never thought he would have pleaded\n'Not Guilty.'  I think it was only with a desire to justify himself in\nthe eyes of some old Hamley acquaintances.  Good God, Miss Wilkins!\nWhat's the matter?  You're not fainting!\"  He rang the bell till the rope\nremained in his hands.  \"Here, Esther!  Jerry!  Whoever you are, come\nquick!  Miss Wilkins has fainted!  Water!  Wine!  Tell Mrs. Johnson to\ncome here directly!\"\n\nMrs. Johnson, a kind, motherly woman, who had been excluded from the\n\"gentleman's dinner party,\" and had devoted her time to superintending\nthe dinner her husband had ordered, came in answer to his call for\nassistance, and found Ellinor lying back in her chair white and\nsenseless.\n\n\"Bessy, Miss Wilkins has fainted; she has had a long journey, and is in a\nfidget about Dixon, the old fellow who was sentenced to be hung for that\nmurder, you know.  I can't stop here, I must go back to those men.  You\nbring her round, and see her to bed.  The blue room is empty since Horner\nleft.  She must stop here, and I'll see her in the morning.  Take care of\nher, and keep her mind as easy as you can, will you, for she can do no\ngood by fidgeting.\"\n\nAnd, knowing that he left Ellinor in good hands, and with plenty of\nassistance about her, he returned to his friends.\n\nEllinor came to herself before long.\n\n\"It was very foolish of me, but I could not help it,\" said she,\napologetically.\n\n\"No; to be sure not, dear.  Here, drink this; it is some of Mr. Johnson's\nbest port wine that he has sent out on purpose for you.  Or would you\nrather have some white soup--or what?  We've had everything you could\nthink of for dinner, and you've only to ask and have.  And then you must\ngo to bed, my dear--Mr. Johnson says you must; and there's a well-aired\nroom, for Mr. Horner only left us this morning.\"\n\n\"I must see Mr. Johnson again, please.\"\n\n\"But indeed you must not.  You must not worry your poor head with\nbusiness now; and Johnson would only talk to you on business.  No; go to\nbed, and sleep soundly, and then you'll get up quite bright and strong,\nand fit to talk about business.\"\n\n\"I cannot sleep--I cannot rest till I have asked Mr. Johnson one or two\nmore questions; indeed I cannot,\" pleaded Ellinor.\n\nMrs. Johnson knew that her husband's orders on such occasions were\nperemptory, and that she should come in for a good conjugal scolding if,\nafter what he had said, she ventured to send for him again.  Yet Ellinor\nlooked so entreating and wistful that she could hardly find in her heart\nto refuse her.  A bright thought struck her.\n\n\"Here is pen and paper, my dear.  Could you not write the questions you\nwanted to ask? and he'll just jot down the answers upon the same piece of\npaper.  I'll send it in by Jerry.  He has got friends to dinner with him,\nyou see.\"\n\nEllinor yielded.  She sat, resting her weary head on her hand, and\nwondering what were the questions which would have come so readily to her\ntongue could she have been face to face with him.  As it was, she only\nwrote this:\n\n\"How early can I see you to-morrow morning?  Will you take all the\nnecessary steps for my going to Dixon as soon as possible?  Could I be\nadmitted to him to-night?\"\n\nThe pencilled answers were:\n\n\"Eight o'clock.  Yes.  No.\"\n\n\"I suppose he knows best,\" said Ellinor, sighing, as she read the last\nword.  \"But it seems wicked in me to be going to bed--and he so near, in\nprison.\"\n\nWhen she rose up and stood, she felt the former dizziness return, and\nthat reconciled her to seeking rest before she entered upon the duties\nwhich were becoming clearer before her, now that she knew all and was on\nthe scene of action.  Mrs. Johnson brought her white-wine whey instead of\nthe tea she had asked for; and perhaps it was owing to this that she\nslept so soundly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nWhen Ellinor awoke the clear light of dawn was fully in the room.  She\ncould not remember where she was; for so many mornings she had wakened up\nin strange places that it took her several minutes before she could make\nout the geographical whereabouts of the heavy blue moreen curtains, the\nprint of the lord-lieutenant of the county on the wall, and all the\nhandsome ponderous mahogany furniture that stuffed up the room.  As soon\nas full memory came into her mind, she started up; nor did she go to bed\nagain, although she saw by her watch on the dressing-table that it was\nnot yet six o'clock.  She dressed herself with the dainty completeness so\nhabitual to her that it had become an unconscious habit, and then--the\ninstinct was irrepressible--she put on her bonnet and shawl, and went\ndown, past the servant on her knees cleaning the doorstep, out into the\nfresh open air; and so she found her way down the High Street to\nHellingford Castle, the building in which the courts of assize were\nheld--the prison in which Dixon lay condemned to die.  She almost knew\nshe could not see him; yet it seemed like some amends to her conscience\nfor having slept through so many hours of the night if she made the\nattempt.  She went up to the porter's lodge, and asked the little girl\nsweeping out the place if she might see Abraham Dixon.  The child stared\nat her, and ran into the house, bringing out her father, a great burly\nman, who had not yet donned either coat or waistcoat, and who,\nconsequently, felt the morning air as rather nipping.  To him Ellinor\nrepeated her question.\n\n\"Him as is to be hung come Saturday se'nnight?  Why, ma'am, I've nought\nto do with it.  You may go to the governor's house and try; but, if\nyou'll excuse me, you'll have your walk for your pains.  Them in the\ncondemned cells is never seen by nobody without the sheriff's order.  You\nmay go up to the governor's house and welcome; but they'll only tell you\nthe same.  Yon's the governor's house.\"\n\nEllinor fully believed the man, and yet she went on to the house\nindicated, as if she still hoped that in her case there might be some\nexception to the rule, which she now remembered to have heard of before,\nin days when such a possible desire as to see a condemned prisoner was\ntreated by her as a wish that some people might have, did have--people as\nfar removed from her circle of circumstances as the inhabitants of the\nmoon.  Of course she met with the same reply, a little more abruptly\ngiven, as if every man was from his birth bound to know such an obvious\nregulation.\n\nShe went out past the porter, now fully clothed.  He was sorry for her\ndisappointment, but could not help saying, with a slight tone of\nexultation: \"Well, you see I was right, ma'am!\"\n\nShe walked as nearly round the castle as ever she could, looking up at\nthe few high-barred windows she could see, and wondering in what part of\nthe building Dixon was confined.  Then she went into the adjoining\nchurchyard, and sitting down upon a tombstone, she gazed idly at the view\nspread below her--a view which was considered as the lion of the place,\nto be shown to all strangers by the inhabitants of Hellingford.  Ellinor\ndid not see it, however; she only saw the blackness of that fatal night,\nthe hurried work--the lanterns glancing to and fro.  She only heard the\nhard breathing of those who are engaged upon unwonted labour; the few\nhoarse muttered words; the swaying of the branches to and fro.  All at\nonce the church clock above her struck eight, and then pealed out for\ndistant labourers to cease their work for a time.  Such was the old\ncustom of the place.  Ellinor rose up, and made her way back to Mr.\nJohnson's house in High Street.  The room felt close and confined in\nwhich she awaited her interview with Mr. Johnson, who had sent down an\napology for having overslept himself, and at last made his appearance in\na hurried half-awakened state, in consequence of his late hospitality of\nthe night before.\n\n\"I am so sorry I gave you all so much trouble last night,\" said Ellinor,\napologetically.  \"I was overtired, and much shocked by the news I heard.\"\n\n\"No trouble, no trouble, I am sure.  Neither Mrs. Johnson nor I felt it\nin the least a trouble.  Many ladies I know feel such things very trying,\nthough there are others that can stand a judge's putting on the black cap\nbetter than most men.  I'm sure I saw some as composed as could be under\nJudge Corbet's speech.\"\n\n\"But about Dixon?  He must not die, Mr. Johnson.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know that he will,\" said Mr. Johnson, in something of the\ntone of voice he would have used in soothing a child.  \"Judge Corbet said\nsomething about the possibility of a pardon.  The jury did not recommend\nhim to mercy: you see, his looks went so much against him, and all the\nevidence was so strong, and no defence, so to speak, for he would not\nfurnish any information on which we could base defence.  But the judge\ndid give some hope, to my mind, though there are others that think\ndifferently.\"\n\n\"I tell you, Mr. Johnson, he must not die, and he shall not.  To whom\nmust I go?\"\n\n\"Whew!  Have you got additional evidence?\" with a sudden sharp glance of\nprofessional inquiry.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Ellinor answered.  \"I beg your pardon . . . only tell me\ninto whose hands the power of life and death has passed.\"\n\n\"Into the Home Secretary's--Sir Phillip Homes; but you cannot get access\nto him on such an errand.  It is the judge who tried the case that must\nurge a reprieve--Judge Corbet.\"\n\n\"Judge Corbet?\"\n\n\"Yes; and he was rather inclined to take a merciful view of the whole\ncase.  I saw it in his charge.  He'll be the person for you to see.  I\nsuppose you don't like to give me your confidence, or else I could\narrange and draw up what will have to be said?\"\n\n\"No.  What I have to say must be spoken to the arbiter--to no one else.  I\nam afraid I answered you impatiently just now.  You must forgive me; if\nyou knew all, I am sure you would.\"\n\n\"Say no more, my dear lady.  We will suppose you have some evidence not\nadduced at the trial.  Well; you must go up and see the judge, since you\ndon't choose to impart it to any one, and lay it before him.  He will\ndoubtless compare it with his notes of the trial, and see how far it\nagrees with them.  Of course you must be prepared with some kind of\nproof; for Judge Corbet will have to test your evidence.\"\n\n\"It seems strange to think of him as the judge,\" said Ellinor, almost to\nherself.\n\n\"Why, yes.  He's but a young judge.  You knew him at Hamley, I suppose?  I\nremember his reading there with Mr. Ness.\"\n\n\"Yes, but do not let us talk more about that time.  Tell me when can I\nsee Dixon?  I have been to the castle already, but they said I must have\na sheriff's order.\"\n\n\"To be sure.  I desired Mrs. Johnson to tell you so last night.  Old\nOrmerod was dining here; he is clerk to the magistrates, and I told him\nof your wish.  He said he would see Sir Henry Croper, and have the order\nhere before ten.  But all this time Mrs. Johnson is waiting breakfast for\nus.  Let me take you into the dining-room.\"\n\nIt was very hard work for Ellinor to do her duty as a guest, and to allow\nherself to be interested and talked to on local affairs by her host and\nhostess.  But she felt as if she had spoken shortly and abruptly to Mr.\nJohnson in their previous conversation, and that she must try and make\namends for it; so she attended to all the details about the restoration\nof the church, and the difficulty of getting a good music-master for the\nthree little Miss Johnsons, with all her usual gentle good breeding and\npatience, though no one can tell how her heart and imagination were full\nof the coming interview with poor old Dixon.\n\nBy-and-by Mr. Johnson was called out of the room to see Mr. Ormerod, and\nreceive the order of admission from him.  Ellinor clasped her hands tight\ntogether as she listened with apparent composure to Mrs Johnson's never-\nending praise of the Hullah system.  But when Mr. Johnson returned, she\ncould not help interrupting her eulogy, and saying--\n\n\"Then I may go now?\"\n\nYes, the order was there--she might go, and Mr. Johnson would accompany\nher, to see that she met with no difficulty or obstacle.\n\nAs they walked thither, he told her that some one--a turnkey, or some\none--would have to be present at the interview; that such was always the\nrule in the case of condemned prisoners; but that if this third person\nwas \"obliging,\" he would keep out of earshot.  Mr. Johnson quietly took\ncare to see that the turnkey who accompanied Ellinor was \"obliging.\"\n\nThe man took her across high-walled courts, along stone corridors, and\nthrough many locked doors, before they came to the condemned cells.\n\n\"I've had three at a time in here,\" said he, unlocking the final door,\n\"after Judge Morton had been here.  We always called him the 'Hanging\nJudge.'  But its five years since he died, and now there's never more\nthan one in at a time; though once it was a woman for poisoning her\nhusband.  Mary Jones was her name.\"\n\nThe stone passage out of which the cells opened was light, and bare, and\nscrupulously clean.  Over each door was a small barred window, and an\nouter window of the same description was placed high up in the cell,\nwhich the turnkey now opened.\n\nOld Abraham Dixon was sitting on the side of his bed, doing nothing.  His\nhead was bent, his frame sunk, and he did not seem to care to turn round\nand see who it was that entered.\n\nEllinor tried to keep down her sobs while the man went up to him, and\nlaying his hand on his shoulder, and lightly shaking him, he said:\n\n\"Here's a friend come to see you, Dixon.\"  Then, turning to Ellinor, he\nadded, \"There's some as takes it in this kind o' stunned way, while\nothers are as restless as a wild beast in a cage, after they're\nsentenced.\"  And then he withdrew into the passage, leaving the door\nopen, so that he could see all that passed if he chose to look, but\nostentatiously keeping his eyes averted, and whistling to himself, so\nthat he could not hear what they said to each other.\n\nDixon looked up at Ellinor, but then let his eyes fall on the ground\nagain; the increasing trembling of his shrunken frame was the only sign\nhe gave that he had recognised her.\n\nShe sat down by him, and took his large horny hand in hers.  She wanted\nto overcome her inclination to sob hysterically before she spoke.  She\nstroked the bony shrivelled fingers, on which her hot scalding tears kept\ndropping.\n\n\"Dunnot do that,\" said he, at length, in a hollow voice.  \"Dunnot take on\nabout it; it's best as it is, missy.\"\n\n\"No, Dixon, it's not best.  It shall not be.  You know it shall\nnot--cannot be.\"\n\n\"I'm rather tired of living.  It's been a great strain and labour for me.\nI think I'd as lief be with God as with men.  And you see, I were fond on\nhim ever sin' he were a little lad, and told me what hard times he had at\nschool, he did, just as if I were his brother!  I loved him next to Molly\nGreaves.  Dear! and I shall see her again, I reckon, come next Saturday\nweek!  They'll think well on me, up there, I'll be bound; though I cannot\nsay as I've done all as I should do here below.\"\n\n\"But, Dixon,\" said Ellinor, \"you know who did this--this--\"\n\n\"Guilty o' murder,\" said he.  \"That's what they called it.  Murder!  And\nthat it never were, choose who did it.\"\n\n\"My poor, poor father did it.  I am going up to London this afternoon; I\nam going to see the judge, and tell him all.\"\n\n\"Don't you demean yourself to that fellow, missy.  It's him as left you\nin the lurch as soon as sorrow and shame came nigh you.\"\n\nHe looked up at her now, for the first time; but she went on as if she\nhad not noticed those wistful, weary eyes.\n\n\"Yes!  I shall go to him.  I know who it is; and I am resolved.  After\nall, he may be better than a stranger, for real help; and I shall never\nremember any--anything else, when I think of you, good faithful friend.\"\n\n\"He looks but a wizened old fellow in his grey wig.  I should hardly ha'\nknown him.  I gave him a look, as much as to say, 'I could tell tales o'\nyou, my lord judge, if I chose.'  I don't know if he heeded me, though.  I\nsuppose it were for a sign of old acquaintance that he said he'd\nrecommend me to mercy.  But I'd sooner have death nor mercy, by long\nodds.  Yon man out there says mercy means Botany Bay.  It 'ud be like\nkilling me by inches, that would.  It would.  I'd liefer go straight to\nHeaven, than live on among the black folk.\"\n\nHe began to shake again: this idea of transportation, from its very\nmysteriousness, was more terrifying to him than death.  He kept on saying\nplaintively, \"Missy, you'll never let 'em send me to Botany Bay; I\ncouldn't stand that.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said she.  \"You shall come out of this prison, and go home with\nme to East Chester; I promise you you shall.  I promise you.  I don't yet\nquite know how, but trust in my promise.  Don't fret about Botany Bay.  If\nyou go there, I go too.  I am so sure you will not go.  And you know if\nyou have done anything against the law in concealing that fatal night's\nwork, I did too, and if you are to be punished, I will be punished too.\nBut I feel sure it will be right; I mean, as right as anything can be,\nwith the recollection of that time present to us, as it must always be.\"\nShe almost spoke these last words to herself.  They sat on, hand in hand\nfor a few minutes more in silence.\n\n\"I thought you'd come to me.  I knowed you were far away in foreign\nparts.  But I used to pray to God.  'Dear Lord God!' I used to say, 'let\nme see her again.'  I told the chaplain as I'd begin to pray for\nrepentance, at after I'd done praying that I might see you once again:\nfor it just seemed to take all my strength to say those words as I've\nnamed.  And I thought as how God knew what was in my heart better than I\ncould tell Him: how I was main and sorry for all as I'd ever done wrong;\nI allays were, at after it was done; but I thought as no one could know\nhow bitter-keen I wanted to see you.\"\n\nAgain they sank into silence.  Ellinor felt as if she would fain be away\nand active in procuring his release; but she also perceived how precious\nher presence was to him; and she did not like to leave him a moment\nbefore the time allowed her.  His voice had changed to a weak, piping old\nman's quaver, and between the times of his talking he seemed to relapse\ninto a dreamy state; but through it all he held her hand tight, as though\nafraid that she would leave him.\n\nSo the hour elapsed, with no more spoken words than those above.  From\ntime to time Ellinor's tears dropped down upon her lap; she could not\nrestrain them, though she scarce knew why she cried just then.\n\nAt length the turnkey said that the time allowed for the interview was\nended.  Ellinor spoke no word; but rose, and bent down and kissed the old\nman's forehead, saying--\n\n\"I shall come back to-morrow.  God keep and comfort you!\"\n\nSo almost without an articulate word from him in reply (he rose up, and\nstood on his shaking legs, as she bade him farewell, putting his hand to\nhis head with the old habitual mark of respect), she went her way,\nswiftly out of the prison, swiftly back with Mr. Johnson to his house,\nscarcely patient or strong enough in her hurry to explain to him fully\nall that she meant to do.  She only asked him a few absolutely requisite\nquestions; and informed him of her intention to go straight to London to\nsee Judge Corbet.\n\nJust before the railway carriage in which she was seated started on the\njourney, she bent forward, and put out her hand once more to Mr. Johnson.\n\"To-morrow I will thank you for all,\" she said.  \"I cannot now.\"\n\nIt was about the same time that she had reached Hellingford on the\nprevious night, that she arrived at the Great Western station on this\nevening--past eight o'clock.  On the way she had remembered and arranged\nmany things: one important question she had omitted to ask Mr. Johnson;\nbut that was easily remedied.  She had not enquired where she could find\nJudge Corbet; if she had, Mr. Johnson could probably have given her his\nprofessional address.  As it was, she asked for a Post-Office Directory\nat the hotel, and looked out for his private dwelling--128 Hyde Park\nGardens.\n\nShe rang for a waiter.\n\n\"Can I send a messenger to Hyde Park Gardens?\" she said, hurrying on to\nher business, tired and worn out as she was.  \"It is only to ask if Judge\nCorbet is at home this evening.  If he is, I must go and see him.\"\n\nThe waiter was a little surprised, and would gladly have had her name to\nauthorise the enquiry but she could not bear to send it: it would be bad\nenough that first meeting, without the feeling that he, too, had had time\nto recall all the past days.  Better to go in upon him unprepared, and\nplunge into the subject.\n\nThe waiter returned with the answer while she yet was pacing up and down\nthe room restlessly, nerving herself for the interview.\n\n\"The messenger has been to Hyde Park Gardens, ma'am.  The Judge and Lady\nCorbet are gone out to dinner.\"\n\nLady Corbet!  Of course Ellinor knew that he was married.  Had she not\nbeen present at the wedding in East Chester Cathedral?  But, somehow,\nthese recent events had so carried her back to old times, that the\nintimate association of the names, \"the Judge and Lady Corbet,\" seemed to\nawaken her out of some dream.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" she said, just as if these thoughts were not passing\nrapidly through her mind.  \"Let me be called at seven to-morrow morning,\nand let me have a cab at the door to Hyde Park Gardens at eight.\"\n\nAnd so she went to bed; but scarcely to sleep.  All night long she had\nthe scenes of those old times, the happy, happy days of her youth, the\none terrible night that cut all happiness short, present before her.  She\ncould almost have fancied that she heard the long-silent sounds of her\nfather's step, her father's way of breathing, the rustle of his newspaper\nas he hastily turned it over, coming through the lapse of years; the\nsilence of the night.  She knew that she had the little writing-case of\nher girlhood with her, in her box.  The treasures of the dead that it\ncontained, the morsel of dainty sewing, the little sister's golden curl,\nthe half-finished letter to Mr. Corbet, were all there.  She took them\nout, and looked at each separately; looked at them long--long and\nwistfully.  \"Will it be of any use to me?\" she questioned of herself, as\nshe was about to put her father's letter back into its receptacle.  She\nread the last words over again, once more:\n\n\"From my death-bed I adjure you to stand her friend; I will beg pardon on\nmy knees for anything.\"\n\n\"I will take it,\" thought she.  \"I need not bring it out; most likely\nthere will be no need for it, after what I shall have to say.  All is so\naltered, so changed between us, as utterly as if it never had been, that\nI think I shall have no shame in showing it him, for my own part of it.\nWhile, if he sees poor papa's, dear, dear papa's suffering humility, it\nmay make him think more gently of one who loved him once though they\nparted in wrath with each other, I'm afraid.\"\n\nSo she took the letter with her when she drove to Hyde Park Gardens.\n\nEvery nerve in her body was in such a high state of tension that she\ncould have screamed out at the cabman's boisterous knock at the door.  She\ngot out hastily, before any one was ready or willing to answer such an\nuntimely summons; paid the man double what he ought to have had; and\nstood there, sick, trembling, and humble.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI AND LAST.\n\n\n\"Is Judge Corbet at home?  Can I see him?\" she asked of the footman, who\nat length answered the door.\n\nHe looked at her curiously, and a little familiarly, before he replied,\n\n\"Why, yes!  He's pretty sure to be at home at this time of day; but\nwhether he'll see you is quite another thing.\"\n\n\"Would you be so good as to ask him?  It is on very particular business.\"\n\n\"Can you give me a card? your name, perhaps, will do, if you have not a\ncard.  I say, Simmons\" (to a lady's-maid crossing the hall), \"is the\njudge up yet?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! he's in his dressing-room this half-hour.  My lady is coming\ndown directly.  It is just breakfast-time.\"\n\n\"Can't you put it off and come again, a little later?\" said he, turning\nonce more to Ellinor--white Ellinor! trembling Ellinor!\n\n\"No! please let me come in.  I will wait.  I am sure Judge Corbet will\nsee me, if you will tell him I am here.  Miss Wilkins.  He will know the\nname.\"\n\n\"Well, then; will you wait here till I have got breakfast in?\" said the\nman, letting her into the hall, and pointing to the bench there, he took\nher, from her dress, to be a lady's-maid or governess, or at most a\ntradesman's daughter; and, besides, he was behindhand with all his\npreparations.  She came in and sat down.\n\n\"You will tell him I am here,\" she said faintly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, never fear: I'll send up word, though I don't believe he'll\ncome to you before breakfast.\"\n\nHe told a page, who ran upstairs, and, knocking at the judge's door, said\nthat a Miss Jenkins wanted to speak to him.\n\n\"Who?\" asked the judge from the inside.\n\n\"Miss Jenkins.  She said you would know the name, sir.\"\n\n\"Not I.  Tell her to wait.\"\n\nSo Ellinor waited.  Presently down the stairs, with slow deliberate\ndignity, came the handsome Lady Corbet, in her rustling silks and ample\npetticoats, carrying her fine boy, and followed by her majestic nurse.\nShe was ill-pleased that any one should come and take up her husband's\ntime when he was at home, and supposed to be enjoying domestic leisure;\nand her imperious, inconsiderate nature did not prompt her to any\ncivility towards the gentle creature sitting down, weary and heart-sick,\nin her house.  On the contrary, she looked her over as she slowly\ndescended, till Ellinor shrank abashed from the steady gaze of the large\nblack eyes.  Then she, her baby and nurse, disappeared into the large\ndining-room, into which all the preparations for breakfast had been\ncarried.\n\nThe next person to come down would be the judge.  Ellinor instinctively\nput down her veil.  She heard his quick decided step; she had known it\nwell of old.\n\nHe gave one of his sharp, shrewd glances at the person sitting in the\nhall and waiting to speak to him, and his practised eye recognised the\nlady at once, in spite of her travel-worn dress.\n\n\"Will you just come into this room?\" said he, opening the door of his\nstudy, to the front of the house: the dining-room was to the back; they\ncommunicated by folding-doors.\n\nThe astute lawyer placed himself with his back to the window; it was the\nnatural position of the master of the apartment; but it also gave him the\nadvantage of seeing his companion's face in full light.  Ellinor lifted\nher veil; it had only been a dislike to a recognition in the hall which\nhad made her put it down.\n\nJudge Corbet's countenance changed more than hers; she had been prepared\nfor the interview; he was not.  But he usually had the full command of\nthe expression on his face.\n\n\"Ellinor!  Miss Wilkins! is it you?\"  And he went forwards, holding out\nhis hand with cordial greeting, under which the embarrassment, if he felt\nany, was carefully concealed.  She could not speak all at once in the way\nshe wished.\n\n\"That stupid Henry told me 'Jenkins!'  I beg your pardon.  How could they\nput you down to sit in the hall?  You must come in and have some\nbreakfast with us; Lady Corbet will be delighted, I'm sure.\"  His sense\nof the awkwardness of the meeting with the woman who was once to have\nbeen his wife, and of the probable introduction which was to follow to\nthe woman who was his actual wife grew upon him, and made him speak a\nlittle hurriedly.  Ellinor's next words were a wonderful relief; and her\nsoft gentle way of speaking was like the touch of a cooling balsam.\n\n\"Thank you, you must excuse me.  I am come strictly on business,\notherwise I should never have thought of calling on you at such an hour.\nIt is about poor Dixon.\"\n\n\"Ah!  I thought as much!\" said the judge, handing her a chair, and\nsitting down himself.  He tried to compose his mind to business, but in\nspite of his strength of character, and his present efforts, the\nremembrance of old times would come back at the sound of her voice.  He\nwondered if he was as much changed in appearance as she struck him as\nbeing in that first look of recognition; after that first glance he\nrather avoided meeting her eyes.\n\n\"I knew how much you would feel it.  Some one at Hellingford told me you\nwere abroad, in Rome, I think.  But you must not distress yourself\nunnecessarily; the sentence is sure to be commuted to transportation, or\nsomething equivalent.  I was talking to the Home Secretary about it only\nlast night.  Lapse of time and subsequent good character quite preclude\nany idea of capital punishment.\"  All the time that he said this he had\nother thoughts at the back of his mind--some curiosity, a little regret,\na touch of remorse, a wonder how the meeting (which, of course, would\nhave to be some time) between Lady Corbet and Ellinor would go off; but\nhe spoke clearly enough on the subject in hand, and no outward mark of\ndistraction from it appeared.\n\nEllinor answered:\n\n\"I came to tell you, what I suppose may be told to any judge, in\nconfidence and full reliance on his secrecy, that Abraham Dixon was not\nthe murderer.\"  She stopped short, and choked a little.\n\nThe judge looked sharply at her.\n\n\"Then you know who was?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, with a low, steady voice, looking him full in the\nface, with sad, solemn eyes.\n\nThe truth flashed into his mind.  He shaded his face, and did not speak\nfor a minute or two.  Then he said, not looking up, a little hoarsely,\n\"This, then, was the shame you told me of long ago?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.\n\nBoth sat quite still; quite silent for some time.  Through the silence a\nsharp, clear voice was heard speaking through the folding-doors.\n\n\"Take the kedgeree down, and tell the cook to keep it hot for the judge.\nIt is so tiresome people coming on business here, as if the judge had not\nhis proper hours for being at chambers.\"\n\nHe got up hastily, and went into the dining-room; but he had audibly some\ndifficulty in curbing his wife's irritation.\n\nWhen he came back, Ellinor said:\n\n\"I am afraid I ought not to have come here now.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's all nonsense!\" said he, in a tone of annoyance.  \"You've done\nquite right.\"  He seated himself where he had been before; and again half\ncovered his face with his hand.\n\n\"And Dixon knew of this.  I believe I must put the fact plainly--to\nyou--your father was the guilty person? he murdered Dunster?\"\n\n\"Yes.  If you call it murder.  It was done by a blow, in the heat of\npassion.  No one can ever tell how Dunster always irritated papa,\" said\nEllinor, in a stupid, heavy way; and then she sighed.\n\n\"How do you know this?\"  There was a kind of tender reluctance in the\njudge's voice, as he put all these questions.  Ellinor had made up her\nmind beforehand that something like them must be asked, and must also be\nanswered; but she spoke like a sleep-walker.\n\n\"I came into papa's room just after he had struck Mr. Dunster the blow.\nHe was lying insensible, as we thought--dead, as he really was.\"\n\n\"What was Dixon's part in it?  He must have known a good deal about it.\nAnd the horse-lancet that was found with his name upon it?\"\n\n\"Papa went to wake Dixon, and he brought his fleam--I suppose to try and\nbleed him.  I have said enough, have I not?  I seem so confused.  But I\nwill answer any question to make it appear that Dixon is innocent.\"\n\nThe judge had been noting all down.  He sat still now without replying to\nher.  Then he wrote rapidly, referring to his previous paper, from time\nto time.  In five minutes or so he read the facts which Ellinor had\nstated, as he now arranged them, in a legal and connected form.  He just\nasked her one or two trivial questions as he did so.  Then he read it\nover to her, and asked her to sign it.  She took up the pen, and held it,\nhesitating.\n\n\"This will never be made public?\" said she.\n\n\"No; I shall take care that no one but the Home Secretary sees it.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  I could not help it, now it has come to this.\"\n\n\"There are not many men like Dixon,\" said the judge, almost to himself,\nas he sealed the paper in an envelope.\n\n\"No,\" said Ellinor; \"I never knew any one so faithful.\"\n\nAnd just at the same moment the reflection on a less faithful person that\nthese words might seem to imply struck both of them, and each\ninstinctively glanced at the other.\n\n\"Ellinor!\" said the judge, after a moment's pause, \"we are friends, I\nhope?\"\n\n\"Yes; friends,\" said she, quietly and sadly.\n\nHe felt a little chagrined at her answer.  Why, he could hardly tell.  To\ncover any sign of his feeling he went on talking.\n\n\"Where are you living now?\"\n\n\"At East Chester.\"\n\n\"But you come sometimes to town, don't you?  Let us know always--whenever\nyou come; and Lady Corbet shall call on you.  Indeed, I wish you'd let me\nbring her to see you to-day.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  I am going straight back to Hellingford; at least, as soon\nas you can get me the pardon for Dixon.\"\n\nHe half smiled at her ignorance.\n\n\"The pardon must be sent to the sheriff, who holds the warrant for his\nexecution.  But, of course, you may have every assurance that it shall be\nsent as soon as possible.  It is just the same as if he had it now.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Ellinor rising.\n\n\"Pray don't go without breakfast.  If you would rather not see Lady\nCorbet just now, it shall be sent in to you in this room, unless you have\nalready breakfasted.\"\n\n\"No, thank you; I would rather not.  You are very kind, and I am very\nglad to have seen you once again.  There is just one thing more,\" said\nshe, colouring a little and hesitating.  \"This note to you was found\nunder papa's pillow after his death; some of it refers to past things;\nbut I should be glad if you could think as kindly as you can of poor\npapa--and so--if you will read it--\"\n\nHe took it and read it, not without emotion.  Then he laid it down on his\ntable, and said--\n\n\"Poor man! he must have suffered a great deal for that night's work.  And\nyou, Ellinor, you have suffered, too.\"\n\nYes, she had suffered; and he who spoke had been one of the instruments\nof her suffering, although he seemed forgetful of it.  She shook her head\na little for reply.  Then she looked up at him--they were both standing\nat the time--and said:\n\n\"I think I shall be happier now.  I always knew it must be found out.\nOnce more, good-by, and thank you.  I may take this letter, I suppose?\"\nsaid she, casting envious loving eyes at her father's note, lying\nunregarded on the table.\n\n\"Oh! certainly, certainly,\" said he; and then he took her hand; he held\nit, while he looked into her face.  He had thought it changed when he had\nfirst seen her, but it was now almost the same to him as of yore.  The\nsweet shy eyes, the indicated dimple in the cheek, and something of fever\nhad brought a faint pink flush into her usually colourless cheeks.\nMarried judge though he was, he was not sure if she had not more charms\nfor him still in her sorrow and her shabbiness than the handsome stately\nwife in the next room, whose looks had not been of the pleasantest when\nhe left her a few minutes before.  He sighed a little regretfully as\nEllinor went away.  He had obtained the position he had struggled for,\nand sacrificed for; but now he could not help wishing that the\nslaughtered creature laid on the shrine of his ambition were alive again.\n\nThe kedgeree was brought up again, smoking hot, but it remained untasted\nby him; and though he appeared to be reading the _Times_, he did not see\na word of the distinct type.  His wife, meanwhile, continued her\ncomplaints of the untimely visitor, whose name he did not give to her in\nits corrected form, as he was not anxious that she should have it in her\npower to identify the call of this morning with a possible future\nacquaintance.\n\nWhen Ellinor reached Mr. Johnson's house in Hellingford that afternoon,\nshe found Miss Monro was there, and that she had been with much\ndifficulty restrained by Mr. Johnson from following her to London.\n\nMiss Monro fondled and purred inarticulately through her tears over her\nrecovered darling, before she could speak intelligibly enough to tell her\nthat Canon Livingstone had come straight to see her immediately on his\nreturn to East Chester, and had suggested her journey to Hellingford, in\norder that she might be of all the comfort she could to Ellinor.  She did\nnot at first let out that he had accompanied her to Hellingford; she was\na little afraid of Ellinor's displeasure at his being there; Ellinor had\nalways objected so much to any advance towards intimacy with him that\nMiss Monro had wished to make.  But Ellinor was different now.\n\n\"How white you are, Nelly!\" said Miss Monro.  \"You have been travelling\ntoo much and too fast, my child.\"\n\n\"My head aches!\" said Ellinor, wearily.  \"But I must go to the castle,\nand tell my poor Dixon that he is reprieved--I am so tired!  Will you ask\nMr. Johnson to get me leave to see him?  He will know all about it.\"\n\nShe threw herself down on the bed in the spare room; the bed with the\nheavy blue curtains.  After an unheeded remonstrance, Miss Monro went to\ndo her bidding.  But it was now late afternoon, and Mr. Johnson said that\nit would be impossible for him to get permission from the sheriff that\nnight.\n\n\"Besides,\" said he, courteously, \"one scarcely knows whether Miss Wilkins\nmay not give the old man false hopes--whether she has not been excited to\nhave false hopes herself; it might be a cruel kindness to let her see\nhim, without more legal certainty as to what his sentence, or reprieve,\nis to be.  By to-morrow morning, if I have properly understood her story,\nwhich was a little confused--\"\n\n\"She is so dreadfully tired, poor creature,\" put in Miss Monro, who never\ncould bear the shadow of a suspicion that Ellinor was not wisest, best,\nin all relations and situations of life.\n\nMr. Johnson went on, with a deprecatory bow: \"Well, then--it really is\nthe only course open to her besides--persuade her to rest for this\nevening.  By to-morrow morning I will have obtained the sheriff's leave,\nand he will most likely have heard from London.\"\n\n\"Thank you!  I believe that will be best.\"\n\n\"It is the only course,\" said he.\n\nWhen Miss Monro returned to the bedroom, Ellinor was in a heavy feverish\nslumber; so feverish and so uneasy did she appear, that, after the\nhesitation of a moment or two, Miss Monro had no scruple in wakening her.\n\nBut she did not appear to understand the answer to her request; she did\nnot seem even to remember that she had made any request.\n\nThe journey to England, the misery, the surprises, had been too much for\nher.  The morrow morning came, bringing the formal free pardon for\nAbraham Dixon.  The sheriff's order for her admission to see the old man\nlay awaiting her wish to use it; but she knew nothing of all this.\n\nFor days, nay weeks, she hovered between life and death, tended, as of\nold, by Miss Monro, while good Mrs. Johnson was ever willing to assist.\n\nOne summer evening in early June she wakened into memory, Miss Monro\nheard the faint piping voice, as she kept her watch by the bedside.\n\n\"Where is Dixon?\" asked she.\n\n\"At the canon's house at Bromham.\"  This was the name of Dr.\nLivingstone's county parish.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We thought it better to get him into country air and fresh scenes at\nonce.\"\n\n\"How is he?\"\n\n\"Much better.  Get strong, and he shall come to see you.\"\n\n\"You are sure all is right?\" said Ellinor.\n\n\"Sure, my dear.  All is quite right.\"\n\nThen Ellinor went to sleep again out of very weakness and weariness.\n\nFrom that time she recovered pretty steadily.  Her great desire was to\nreturn to East Chester as soon as possible.  The associations of grief,\nanxiety, and coming illness, connected with Hellingford, made her wish to\nbe once again in the solemn, quiet, sunny close of East Chester.\n\nCanon Livingstone came over to assist Miss Monro in managing the journey\nwith her invalid.  But he did not intrude himself upon Ellinor, any more\nthan he had done in coming from home.\n\nThe morning after her return, Miss Monro said:\n\n\"Do you feel strong enough to see Dixon?\"\n\n\"Is he here?\"\n\n\"He is at the canon's house.  He sent for him from Bromham, in order that\nhe might be ready for you to see him when you wished.\"\n\n\"Please let him come directly,\" said Ellinor, flushing and trembling.\n\nShe went to the door to meet the tottering old man; she led him to the\neasy-chair that had been placed and arranged for herself; she knelt down\nbefore him, and put his hands on her head, he trembling and shaking all\nthe while.\n\n\"Forgive me all the shame and misery, Dixon.  Say you forgive me; and\ngive me your blessing.  And then let never a word of the terrible past be\nspoken between us.\"\n\n\"It's not for me to forgive you, as never did harm to no one--\"\n\n\"But say you do--it will ease my heart.\"\n\n\"I forgive thee!\" said he.  And then he raised himself to his feet with\neffort, and, standing up above her, he blessed her solemnly.\n\nAfter that he sat down, she by him, gazing at him.\n\n\"Yon's a good man, missy,\" he said, at length, lifting his slow eyes and\nlooking at her.  \"Better nor t'other ever was.\"\n\n\"He is a good man,\" said Ellinor.\n\nBut no more was spoken on the subject.  The next day, Canon Livingstone\nmade his formal call.  Ellinor would fain have kept Miss Monro in the\nroom, but that worthy lady knew better than to stop.\n\nThey went on, forcing talk on indifferent subjects.  At last he could\nspeak no longer on everything but that which he had most at heart.  \"Miss\nWilkins!\" (he had got up, and was standing by the mantelpiece, apparently\nexamining the ornaments upon it)--\"Miss Wilkins! is there any chance of\nyour giving me a favourable answer now--you know what I mean--what we\nspoke about at the Great Western Hotel, that day?\"\n\nEllinor hung her head.\n\n\"You know that I was once engaged before?\"\n\n\"Yes!  I know; to Mr. Corbet--he that is now the judge; you cannot\nsuppose that would make any difference, if that is all.  I have loved\nyou, and you only, ever since we met, eighteen years ago.  Miss\nWilkins--Ellinor--put me out of suspense.\"\n\n\"I will!\" said she, putting out her thin white hand for him to take and\nkiss, almost with tears of gratitude, but she seemed frightened at his\nimpetuosity, and tried to check him.  \"Wait--you have not heard all--my\npoor, poor father, in a fit of anger, irritated beyond his bearing,\nstruck the blow that killed Mr. Dunster--Dixon and I knew of it, just\nafter the blow was struck--we helped to hide it--we kept the secret--my\npoor father died of sorrow and remorse--you now know all--can you still\nlove me?  It seems to me as if I had been an accomplice in such a\nterrible thing!\"\n\n\"Poor, poor Ellinor!\" said he, now taking her in his arms as a shelter.\n\"How I wish I had known of all this years and years ago: I could have\nstood between you and so much!\"\n\nThose who pass through the village of Bromham, and pause to look over the\nlaurel-hedge that separates the rectory garden from the road, may often\nsee, on summer days, an old, old man, sitting in a wicker-chair, out upon\nthe lawn.  He leans upon his stick, and seldom raises his bent head; but\nfor all that his eyes are on a level with the two little fairy children\nwho come to him in all their small joys and sorrows, and who learnt to\nlisp his name almost as soon as they did that of their father and mother.\n\nNor is Miss Monro often absent; and although she prefers to retain the\nold house in the Close for winter quarters, she generally makes her way\nacross to Canon Livingstone's residence every evening.\n\nSO ENDS \"A DARK NIGHT'S WORK.\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A DARK NIGHT'S WORK***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 2522.txt or 2522.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/5\/2\/2522\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":540,"split":"train"}
