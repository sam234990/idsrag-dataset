At the start of the novel, in 1819, he owns a successful perfume shop, La Reine des Roses, he has been elected deputy mayor of his arrondissement in Paris, and he has been awarded the Legion of Honour. During the revolution he took part in the Royalist 13 Vend\u00e9miaire uprising against the Republic, at one stage confronting Napoleon Bonaparte himself, and he mentions this often in conversation. He is married to Constance and has a daughter Cesarine. He plans to throw a ball at his home, and make renovations to his home for the ball. He becomes involved in property speculation with borrowed money, through his notary Roguin. He plans to expand his business with a new hair oil product, with his assistant Anselme Popinot (who is in love with Cesarine) as his business partner. All of these plans have caused him to run up large debts.\nWhat he does not realise is that Roguin has money problems of his own, and that C\u00e9sar's former shop assistant Ferdinand du Tillet, now a banker, is manipulating Roguin in order to have revenge against C\u00e9sar. His financial situation becomes a crisis when Roguin absconds and leaves C\u00e9sar with debts that he is not able to pay. His attempts to get financial assistance from various bankers such as Nucingen, the Keller brothers and Gigonnet (all recurring characters in La Com\u00e9die humaine) fail, since all are friends of du Tillet and acting on his instructions. This leads him to declare bankruptcy, sell La Reine des Roses to his assistant Celestin Crevel and retire from business.\nEventually C\u00e9sar pays off all of his debts when his business venture with Popinot succeeds. He then dies suddenly, but happy that his honour has been restored.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Rise and Fall of Cesar Birotteau, by Honore de Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

CESAR AT HIS APOGEE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nDuring winter nights noise never ceases in the Rue Saint-Honore except\nfor a short interval. Kitchen-gardeners carrying their produce to market\ncontinue the stir of carriages returning from theatres and balls. Near\nthe middle of this sustained pause in the grand symphony of Parisian\nuproar, which occurs about one o'clock in the morning, the wife of\nMonsieur Cesar Birotteau, a perfumer established near the Place Vendome,\nwas startled from her sleep by a frightful dream. She had seen her\ndouble. She had appeared to herself clothed in rags, turning with a\nshrivelled, withered hand the latch of her own shop-door, seeming to be\nat the threshold, yet at the same time seated in her armchair behind the\ncounter. She was asking alms of herself, and heard herself speaking from\nthe doorway and also from her seat at the desk.\n\nShe tried to grasp her husband, but her hand fell on a cold place.\nHer terror became so intense that she could not move her neck, which\nstiffened as if petrified; the membranes of her throat became glued\ntogether, her voice failed her. She remained sitting erect in the same\nposture in the middle of the alcove, both panels of which were wide\nopen, her eyes staring and fixed, her hair quivering, her ears filled\nwith strange noises, her heart tightened yet palpitating, and her person\nbathed in perspiration though chilled to the bone.\n\nFear is a half-diseased sentiment, which presses so violently upon the\nhuman mechanism that the faculties are suddenly excited to the highest\ndegree of their power or driven to utter disorganization. Physiologists\nhave long wondered at this phenomenon, which overturns their systems\nand upsets all theories; it is in fact a thunderbolt working within the\nbeing, and, like all electric accidents, capricious and whimsical in its\ncourse. This explanation will become a mere commonplace in the day\nwhen scientific men are brought to recognize the immense part which\nelectricity plays in human thought.\n\nMadame Birotteau now passed through several of the shocks, in some sort\nelectrical, which are produced by terrible explosions of the will forced\nout, or held under, by some mysterious mechanism. Thus during a\nperiod of time, very short if judged by a watch, but immeasurable when\ncalculated by the rapidity of her impressions, the poor woman had the\nsupernatural power of emitting more ideas and bringing to the surface\nmore recollections than, under any ordinary use of her faculties, she\ncould put forth in the course of a whole day. The poignant tale of her\nmonologue may be abridged into a few absurd sentences, as contradictory\nand bare of meaning as the monologue itself.\n\n\"There is no reason why Birotteau should leave my bed! He has eaten so\nmuch veal that he may be ill. But if he were ill he would have waked\nme. For nineteen years that we have slept together in this bed, in this\nhouse, it has never happened that he left his place without telling\nme,--poor sheep! He never slept away except to pass the night in the\nguard-room. Did he come to bed to-night? Why, of course; goodness! how\nstupid I am.\"\n\nShe cast her eyes upon the bed and saw her husband's night-cap, which\nstill retained the almost conical shape of his head.\n\n\"Can he be dead? Has he killed himself? Why?\" she went on. \"For the\nlast two years, since they made him deputy-mayor, he is\n_all-I-don't-know-how_. To put him into public life! On the word of an\nhonest woman, isn't it pitiable? His business is doing well, for he gave\nme a shawl. But perhaps it isn't doing well? Bah! I should know of\nit. Does one ever know what a man has got in his head; or a woman\neither?--there is no harm in that. Didn't we sell five thousand francs'\nworth to-day? Besides, a deputy mayor couldn't kill himself; he knows\nthe laws too well. Where is he then?\"\n\nShe could neither turn her neck, nor stretch out her hand to pull\nthe bell, which would have put in motion a cook, three clerks, and a\nshop-boy. A prey to the nightmare, which still lasted though her\nmind was wide awake, she forgot her daughter peacefully asleep in an\nadjoining room, the door of which opened at the foot of her bed. At last\nshe cried \"Birotteau!\" but got no answer. She thought she had called the\nname aloud, though in fact she had only uttered it mentally.\n\n\"Has he a mistress? He is too stupid,\" she added. \"Besides, he loves me\ntoo well for that. Didn't he tell Madame Roguin that he had never been\nunfaithful to me, even in thought? He is virtue upon earth, that man. If\nany one ever deserved paradise he does. What does he accuse himself of\nto his confessor, I wonder? He must tell him a lot of fiddle-faddle.\nRoyalist as he is, though he doesn't know why, he can't froth up his\nreligion. Poor dear cat! he creeps to Mass at eight o'clock as slyly as\nif he were going to a bad house. He fears God for God's sake; hell\nis nothing to him. How could he have a mistress? He is so tied to my\npetticoat that he bores me. He loves me better than his own eyes; he\nwould put them out for my sake. For nineteen years he has never said to\nme one word louder than another. His daughter is never considered before\nme. But Cesarine is here--Cesarine! Cesarine!--Birotteau has never had\na thought which he did not tell me. He was right enough when he declared\nto me at the Petit-Matelot that I should never know him till I tried\nhim. And _not here_! It is extraordinary!\"\n\nShe turned her head with difficulty and glanced furtively about the\nroom, then filled with those picturesque effects which are the despair\nof language and seem to belong exclusively to the painters of genre.\nWhat words can picture the alarming zig-zags produced by falling\nshadows, the fantastic appearance of curtains bulged out by the wind,\nthe flicker of uncertain light thrown by a night-lamp upon the folds of\nred calico, the rays shed from a curtain-holder whose lurid centre\nwas like the eye of a burglar, the apparition of a kneeling dress,--in\nshort, all the grotesque effects which terrify the imagination at a\nmoment when it has no power except to foresee misfortunes and exaggerate\nthem? Madame Birotteau suddenly saw a strong light in the room beyond\nher chamber, and thought of fire; but perceiving a red foulard which\nlooked like a pool of blood, her mind turned exclusively to burglars,\nespecially when she thought she saw traces of a struggle in the way the\nfurniture stood about the room. Recollecting the sum of money which\nwas in the desk, a generous fear put an end to the chill ferment of her\nnightmare. She sprang terrified, and in her night-gown, into the very\ncentre of the room to help her husband, whom she supposed to be in the\ngrasp of assassins.\n\n\"Birotteau! Birotteau!\" she cried at last in a voice full of anguish.\n\nShe then saw the perfumer in the middle of the next room, a yard-stick\nin his hand measuring the air, and so ill wrapped up in his green cotton\ndressing-gown with chocolate-colored spots that the cold had reddened\nhis legs without his feeling it, preoccupied as he was. When Cesar\nturned about to say to his wife, \"Well, what do you want, Constance?\"\nhis air and manner, like those of a man absorbed in calculations, were\nso prodigiously silly that Madame Birotteau began to laugh.\n\n\"Goodness! Cesar, if you are not an oddity like that!\" she said. \"Why\ndid you leave me alone without telling me? I have nearly died of terror;\nI did not know what to imagine. What are you doing there, flying open\nto all the winds? You'll get as hoarse as a wolf. Do you hear me,\nBirotteau?\"\n\n\"Yes, wife, here I am,\" answered the perfumer, coming into the bedroom.\n\n\"Come and warm yourself, and tell me what maggot you've got in your\nhead,\" replied Madame Birotteau opening the ashes of the fire, which she\nhastened to relight. \"I am frozen. What a goose I was to get up in my\nnight-gown! But I really thought they were assassinating you.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper put his candlestick on the chimney-piece, wrapped his\ndressing-gown closer about him, and went mechanically to find a flannel\npetticoat for his wife.\n\n\"Here, Mimi, cover yourself up,\" he said. \"Twenty-two by eighteen,\" he\nresumed, going on with his monologue; \"we can get a superb salon.\"\n\n\"Ah, ca! Birotteau, are you on the high road to insanity? Are you\ndreaming?\"\n\n\"No, wife, I am calculating.\"\n\n\"You had better wait till daylight for your nonsense,\" she cried,\nfastening the petticoat beneath her short night-gown and going to the\ndoor of the room where her daughter was in bed.\n\n\"Cesarine is asleep,\" she said, \"she won't hear us. Come, Birotteau,\nspeak up. What is it?\"\n\n\"We can give a ball.\"\n\n\"Give a ball! we? On the word of an honest woman, you are dreaming, my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"I am not dreaming, my beautiful white doe. Listen. People should\nalways do what their position in life demands. Government has brought\nme forward into prominence. I belong to the government; it is my duty to\nstudy its mind, and further its intentions by developing them. The Duc\nde Richelieu has just put an end to the occupation of France by\nthe foreign armies. According to Monsieur de la Billardiere, the\nfunctionaries who represent the city of Paris should make it their duty,\neach in his own sphere of influence, to celebrate the liberation of our\nterritory. Let us show a true patriotism which shall put these liberals,\nthese damned intriguers, to the blush; hein? Do you think I don't love\nmy country? I wish to show the liberals, my enemies, that to love the\nking is to love France.\"\n\n\"Do you think you have got any enemies, my poor Birotteau?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, wife, we have enemies. Half our friends in the quarter are\nour enemies. They all say, 'Birotteau has had luck; Birotteau is a man\nwho came from nothing: yet here he is deputy-mayor; everything succeeds\nwith him.' Well, they are going to be finely surprised. You are the\nfirst to be told that I am made a chevalier of the Legion of honor. The\nking signed the order yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh! then,\" said Madame Birotteau, much moved, \"of course we must give\nthe ball, my good friend. But what have you done to merit the cross?\"\n\n\"Yesterday, when Monsieur de la Billardiere told me the news,\" said\nBirotteau, modestly, \"I asked myself, as you do, what claims I had to\nit; but I ended by seeing what they were, and in approving the action\nof the government. In the first place, I am a royalist; I was wounded\nat Saint-Roch in Vendemiaire: isn't it something to have borne arms\nin those days for the good cause? Then, according to the merchants, I\nexercised my judicial functions in a way to give general satisfaction. I\nam now deputy-mayor. The king grants four crosses to the municipality of\nParis; the prefect, selecting among the deputies suitable persons to be\nthus decorated, has placed my name first on the list. The king moreover\nknows me: thanks to old Ragon. I furnish him with the only powder he is\nwilling to use; we alone possess the receipt of the late queen,--poor,\ndear, august victim! The mayor vehemently supported me. So there it is.\nIf the king gives me the cross without my asking for it, it seems to me\nthat I cannot refuse it without failing in my duty to him. Did I seek to\nbe deputy-mayor? So, wife, since we are sailing before the wind, as\nyour uncle Pillerault says when he is jovial, I have decided to put the\nhousehold on a footing in conformity with our high position. If I can\nbecome anything, I'll risk being whatever the good God wills that I\nshall be,--sub-prefect, if such be my destiny. My wife, you are much\nmistaken if you think a citizen has paid his debt to his country by\nmerely selling perfumery for twenty years to those who came to buy it.\nIf the State demands the help of our intelligence, we are as much bound\nto give it as we are to pay the tax on personal property, on windows and\ndoors, _et caetera_. Do you want to stay forever behind your counter?\nYou have been there, thank God, a long time. This ball shall be our\nfete,--yours and mine. Good-by to economy,--for your sake, be it\nunderstood. I burn our sign, 'The Queen of Roses'; I efface the name,\n'Cesar Birotteau, Perfumer, Successor to Ragon,' and put simply,\n'Perfumery' in big letters of gold. On the _entresol_ I place the\noffice, the counting-room, and a pretty little sanctum for you. I make\nthe shop out of the back-shop, the present dining-room, and kitchen. I\nhire the first floor of the next house, and open a door into it through\nthe wall. I turn the staircase so as to pass from house to house on one\nfloor; and we shall thus get a grand appartement, furnished like a nest.\nYes, I shall refurnish your bedroom, and contrive a boudoir for you and\na pretty chamber for Cesarine. The shop-girl whom you will hire, our\nhead clerk, and your lady's-maid (yes, Madame, you are to have one!)\nwill sleep on the second floor. On the third will be the kitchen and\nrooms of the cook and the man-of-all-work. The fourth shall be a general\nstore-house for bottle, crystals, and porcelains. The workshop for our\npeople, in the attic! Passers-by shall no longer see them gumming on\nthe labels, making the bags, sorting the flasks, and corking the phials.\nVery well for the Rue Saint-Denis, but for the Rue Saint-Honore--fy! bad\nstyle! Our shop must be as comfortable as a drawing-room. Tell me, are\nwe the only perfumers who have reached public honors? Are there not\nvinegar merchants and mustard men who command in the National Guard and\nare very well received at the Palace? Let us imitate them; let us extend\nour business, and at the same time press forward into higher society.\"\n\n\"Goodness! Birotteau, do you know what I am thinking of as I listen to\nyou? You are like the man who looks for knots in a bulrush. Recollect\nwhat I said when it was a question of making you deputy-mayor: 'your\npeace of mind before everything!' You are as fit, I told you, 'to be put\nforward in public life as my arm is to turn a windmill. Honors will be\nyour ruin!' You would not listen to me, and now the ruin has come. To\nplay a part in politics you must have money: have we any? What! would\nyou burn your sign, which cost six hundred francs, and renounce 'The\nQueen of Roses,' your true glory? Leave ambition to others. He who puts\nhis hand in the fire gets burned,--isn't that true? Politics burn in\nthese days. We have one hundred good thousand francs invested outside of\nour business, our productions, our merchandise. If you want to increase\nyour fortune, do as they did in 1793. The Funds are at sixty-two:\nbuy into the Funds. You will get ten thousand francs' income, and the\ninvestment won't hamper our property. Take advantage of the occasion to\nmarry our daughter; sell the business, and let us go and live in your\nnative place. Why! for fifteen years you have talked of nothing but\nbuying Les Tresorieres, that pretty little property near Chinon, where\nthere are woods and fields, and ponds and vineyards, and two dairies,\nwhich bring in a thousand crowns a year, with a house which we both\nlike,--all of which we can have for sixty thousand francs; and, lo!\nMonsieur now wants to become something under government! Recollect what\nwe are,--perfumers. If sixteen years before you invented the DOUBLE\nPASTE OF SULTANS and the CARMINATIVE BALM some one had said, 'You are\ngoing to make enough money to buy Les Tresorieres,' wouldn't you have\nbeen half sick with joy? Well, you can acquire that property which you\nwanted so much that you hardly opened your mouth about anything else,\nand now you talk of spending on nonsense money earned by the sweat of\nour brow: I can say ours, for I've sat behind the desk through all that\ntime, like a poor dog in his kennel. Isn't it much better to come and\nvisit our daughter after she is married to a notary of Paris, and live\neight months of the year at Chinon, than to begin here to make five sous\nsix blanks, and of six blanks nothing? Wait for a rise in the Funds, and\nyou can give eight thousand francs a year to your daughter and we can\nkeep two thousand for ourselves, and the proceeds of the business will\nallow us to buy Les Tresorieres. There in your native place, my good\nlittle cat, with our furniture, which is worth a great deal, we shall\nlive like princes; whereas here we want at least a million to make any\nfigure at all.\"\n\n\"I expected you to say all this, wife,\" said Cesar Birotteau. \"I am not\nquite such a fool (though you think me a great fool, you do) as not to\nhave thought of all that. Now, listen to me. Alexandre Crottat will fit\nus like a glove for a son-in-law, and he will succeed Roguin; but do\nyou suppose he will be satisfied with a hundred thousand francs\n_dot_?--supposing that we gave our whole property outside of the\nbusiness to establish our daughter, and I am willing; I would gladly\nlive on dry bread the rest of my days to see her happy as a queen, the\nwife of a notary of Paris, as you say. Well, then, a hundred thousand\nfrancs, or even eight thousand francs a year, is nothing at all towards\nbuying Roguin's practice. Little Xandrot, as we call him, thinks,\nlike all the rest of the world, that we are richer than we are. If his\nfather, that big farmer who is as close as a snail, won't sell a hundred\nthousand francs worth of land Xandrot can't be a notary, for Roguin's\npractice is worth four or five hundred thousand. If Crottat does not\npay half down, how could he negotiate the affair? Cesarine must have two\nhundred thousand francs _dot_; and I mean that you and I shall retire\nsolid bourgeois of Paris, with fifteen thousand francs a year. Hein! If\nI could make you see that as plain as day, wouldn't it shut your mouth?\"\n\n\"Oh, if you've got the mines of Peru--\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, my lamb. Yes,\" he said, taking his wife by the waist and\nstriking her with little taps, under an emotion of joy which lighted up\nhis features, \"I did not wish to tell you of this matter till it was all\ncooked; but to-morrow it will be done,--that is, perhaps it will. Here\nit is then: Roguin has proposed a speculation to me, so safe that he has\ngone into it with Ragon, with your uncle Pillerault, and two other of\nhis clients. We are to buy property near the Madeleine, which, according\nto Roguin's calculations, we shall get for a quarter of the value which\nit will bring three years from now, at which time, the present leases\nhaving expired, we shall manage it for ourselves. We have all six taken\ncertain shares. I furnish three hundred thousand francs,--that is,\nthree-eighths of the whole. If any one of us wants money, Roguin will\nget it for him by hypothecating his share. To hold the gridiron and know\nhow the fish are fried, I have chosen to be nominally proprietor of one\nhalf, which is, however, to be the common property of Pillerault and\nthe worthy Ragon and myself. Roguin will be, under the name of Monsieur\nCharles Claparon, co-proprietor with me, and will give a reversionary\ndeed to his associates, as I shall to mine. The deeds of purchase are\nmade by promises of sale under private seal, until we are masters of\nthe whole property. Roguin will investigate as to which of the contracts\nshould be paid in money, for he is not sure that we can dispense with\nregistering and yet turn over the titles to those to whom we sell in\nsmall parcels. But it takes too long to explain all this to you. The\nground once paid for, we have only to cross our arms and in three\nyears we shall be rich by a million. Cesarine will then be twenty, our\nbusiness will be sold, and we shall step, by the grace of God, modestly\nto eminence.\"\n\n\"Where will you get your three hundred thousand francs?\" said Madame\nBirotteau.\n\n\"You don't understand business, my beloved little cat. I shall take the\nhundred thousand francs which are now with Roguin; I shall borrow forty\nthousand on the buildings and gardens where we now have our manufactory\nin the Faubourg du Temple; we have twenty thousand francs here in\nhand,--in all, one hundred and sixty thousand. There remain one hundred\nand forty thousand more, for which I shall sign notes to the order\nof Monsieur Charles Claparon, banker. He will pay the value, less the\ndiscount. So there are the three hundred thousand francs provided for.\nHe who owns rents owes nothing. When the notes fall due we can pay them\noff with our profits. If we cannot pay them in cash, Roguin will give\nthe money at five per cent, hypothecated on my share of the property.\nBut such loans will be unnecessary. I have discovered an essence which\nwill make the hair grow--an Oil Comagene, from Syria! Livingston has\njust set up for me a hydraulic press to manufacture the oil from nuts,\nwhich yield it readily under strong pressure. In a year, according to\nmy calculations, I shall have made a hundred thousand francs at least.\nI meditate an advertisement which shall begin, 'Down with wigs!'--the\neffect will be prodigious. You have never found out my wakefulness,\nMadame! For three months the success of Macassar Oil has kept me from\nsleeping. I am resolved to take the shine out of Macassar!\"\n\n\"So these are the fine projects you've been rolling in your noddle for\ntwo months without choosing to tell me? I have just seen myself begging\nat my own door,--a warning from heaven! Before long we shall have\nnothing left but our eyes to weep with. Never while I live shall you do\nit; do you hear me, Cesar? Underneath all this there is some plot\nwhich you don't perceive; you are too upright and loyal to suspect the\ntrickery of others. Why should they come and offer you millions? You are\ngiving up your property, you are going beyond your means; and if your\noil doesn't succeed, if you don't make the money, if the value of the\nland can't be realized, how will you pay your notes? With the shells of\nyour nuts? To rise in society you are going to hide your name, take down\nyour sign, 'The Queen of Roses,' and yet you mean to salaam and bow\nand scrape in advertisements and prospectuses, which will placard Cesar\nBirotteau at every corner, and on all the boards, wherever they are\nbuilding.\"\n\n\"Oh! you are not up to it all. I shall have a branch establishment,\nunder the name of Popinot, in some house near the Rue des Lombards,\nwhere I shall put little Anselme. I shall pay my debt of gratitude to\nMonsieur and Madame Ragon by setting up their nephew, who can make his\nfortune. The poor Ragonines look to me half-starved of late.\"\n\n\"Bah! all those people want your money.\"\n\n\"But what people, my treasure? Is it your uncle Pillerault, who loves\nus like the apple of his eye, and dines with us every Sunday? Is it good\nold Ragon, our predecessor, who has forty upright years in business\nto boast of, and with whom we play our game of boston? Is it Roguin, a\nnotary, a man fifty-seven years old, twenty-five of which he has been in\noffice? A notary of Paris! he would be the flower of the lot, if honest\nfolk were not all worth the same price. If necessary, my associates will\nhelp me. Where is the plot, my white doe? Look here, I must tell you\nyour defect. On the word of an honest man it lies on my heart. You are\nas suspicious as a cat. As soon as we had two sous worth in the shop you\nthought the customers were all thieves. I had to go down on my knees to\nyou to let me make you rich. For a Parisian girl you have no ambition!\nIf it hadn't been for your perpetual fears, no man could have been\nhappier than I. If I had listened to you I should never have invented\nthe Paste of Sultans nor the Carminative Balm. Our shop has given us\na living, but these two discoveries have made the hundred and sixty\nthousand francs which we possess, net and clear! Without my genius, for\nI certainly have talent as a perfumer, we should now be petty retail\nshopkeepers, pulling the devil's tail to make both ends meet. I\nshouldn't be a distinguished merchant, competing in the election of\njudges for the department of commerce; I should be neither a judge nor\na deputy-mayor. Do you know what I should be? A shopkeeper like Pere\nRagon,--be it said without offence, for I respect shopkeeping; the best\nof our kidney are in it. After selling perfumery like him for forty\nyears, we should be worth three thousand francs a year; and at the price\nthings are now, for they have doubled in value, we should, like them,\nhave barely enough to live on. (Day after day that poor household wrings\nmy heart more and more. I must know more about it, and I'll get the\ntruth from Popinot to-morrow!) If I had followed your advice--you who\nhave such uneasy happiness and are always asking whether you will have\nto-morrow what you have got to-day--I should have no credit, I should\nhave no cross of the Legion of honor. I should not be on the highroad to\nbecoming a political personage. Yes, you may shake your head, but if our\naffair succeeds I may become deputy of Paris. Ah! I am not named Cesar\nfor nothing; I succeed. It is unimaginable! outside every one credits\nme with capacity, but here the only person whom I want so much to please\nthat I sweat blood and water to make her happy, is precisely the one who\ntakes me for a fool.\"\n\nThese phrases, divided by eloquent pauses and delivered like shot, after\nthe manner of those who recriminate, expressed so deep and constant an\nattachment that Madame Birotteau was inwardly touched, though, like all\nwomen, she made use of the love she inspired to gain her end.\n\n\"Well! Birotteau,\" she said, \"if you love me, let me be happy in my own\nway. Neither you nor I have education; we don't know how to talk, nor\nto play 'your obedient servant' like men of the world; how then do you\nexpect that we could succeed in government places? I shall be happy at\nLes Tresorieres, indeed I shall. I have always loved birds and animals,\nand I can pass my life very well taking care of the hens and the farm.\nLet us sell the business, marry Cesarine, and give up your visions. We\ncan come and pass the winters in Paris with our son-in-law; we shall be\nhappy; nothing in politics or commerce can then change our way of life.\nWhy do you want to crush others? Isn't our present fortune enough for\nus? When you are a millionaire can you eat two dinners; will you want\ntwo wives? Look at my uncle Pillerault! He is wisely content with his\nlittle property, and spends his life in good deeds. Does he want fine\nfurniture? Not he! I know very well you have been ordering furniture for\nme; I saw Braschon here, and it was not to buy perfumery.\"\n\n\"Well, my beauty, yes! Your furniture is ordered; our improvements begin\nto-morrow, and are superintended by an architect recommended to me by\nMonsieur de la Billardiere.\"\n\n\"My God!\" she cried, \"have pity upon us!\"\n\n\"But you are not reasonable, my love. Do you think that at thirty-seven\nyears of age, fresh and pretty as you are, you can go and bury yourself\nat Chinon? I, thank God, am only thirty-nine. Chance opens to me a fine\ncareer; I enter upon it. If I conduct myself prudently I can make an\nhonorable house among the bourgeoisie of Paris, as was done in former\ntimes. I can found the house of Birotteau, like the house of Keller,\nor Jules Desmartes, or Roguin, Cochin, Guillaume, Lebas, Nucingen,\nSaillard, Popinot, Matifat, who make their mark, or have made it, in\ntheir respective quarters. Come now! If this affair were not as sure as\nbars of gold--\"\n\n\"Sure!\"\n\n\"Yes, sure. For two months I have figured at it. Without seeming to do\nso, I have been getting information on building from the department of\npublic works, from architects and contractors. Monsieur Grindot, the\nyoung architect who is to alter our house, is in despair that he has no\nmoney to put into the speculation.\"\n\n\"He hopes for the work; he says that to screw something out of you.\"\n\n\"Can he take in such men as Pillerault, as Charles Claparon, as Roguin?\nThe profit is as sure as that of the Paste of Sultans.\"\n\n\"But, my dear friend, why should Roguin speculate? He gets his\ncommissions, and his fortune is made. I see him pass sometimes more full\nof care than a minister of state, with an underhand look which I don't\nlike; he hides some secret anxiety. His face has grown in five years to\nlook like that of an old rake. Who can be sure that he won't kick over\nthe traces when he gets all your property into his own hands. Such\nthings happen. Do we know him well? He has only been a friend for\nfifteen years, and I wouldn't put my hand into the fire for him. Why! he\nis not decent: he does not live with his wife. He must have mistresses\nwho ruin him; I don't see any other cause for his anxiety. When I am\ndressing I look through the blinds, and I often see him coming home in\nthe mornings: where from? Nobody knows. He seems to me like a man who\nhas an establishment in town, who spends on his pleasures, and Madame on\nhers. Is that the life of a notary? If they make fifty thousand francs a\nyear and spend sixty thousand, in twenty years they will get to the end\nof their property and be as naked as the little Saint John; and then, as\nthey can't do without luxury, they will prey upon their friends without\ncompunction. Charity begins at home. He is intimate with that little\nscamp du Tillet, our former clerk; and I see nothing good in that\nfriendship. If he doesn't know how to judge du Tillet he must be blind;\nand if he does know him, why does he pet him? You'll tell me, because\nhis wife is fond of du Tillet. Well, I don't look for any good in a man\nwho has no honor with respect to his wife. Besides, the present owners\nof that land must be fools to sell for a hundred sous what is worth\na hundred francs. If you met a child who did not know the value of a\nlouis, wouldn't you feel bound to tell him of it? Your affair looks to\nme like a theft, be it said without offence.\"\n\n\"Good God! how queer women are sometimes, and how they mix up ideas!\nIf Roguin were not in this business, you would say to me: 'Look here,\nCesar, you are going into a thing without Roguin; therefore it is worth\nnothing.' But to-day he is in it, as security, and you tell me--\"\n\n\"No, that is a Monsieur Claparon.\"\n\n\"But a notary cannot put his own name into a speculation.\"\n\n\"Then why is he doing a thing forbidden by law? How do you answer that,\nyou who are guided by law?\"\n\n\"Let me go on. Roguin is in it, and you tell me the business is\nworthless. Is that reasonable? You say, 'He is acting against the law.'\nBut he would put himself openly in the business if it were necessary.\nCan't they say the same of me? Would Ragon and Pillerault come and say\nto me: 'Why do you have to do with this affair,--you who have made your\nmoney as a merchant?'\"\n\n\"Merchants are not in the same position as notaries,\" said Madame\nBirotteau.\n\n\"Well, my conscience is clear,\" said Cesar, continuing; \"the people who\nsell, sell because they must; we do not steal from them any more than\nyou steal from others when you buy their stocks at seventy-five. We buy\nthe ground to-day at to-day's price. In two years it will be another\nthing; just so with stocks. Know then, Constance-Barbe-Josephine\nPillerault, that you will never catch Cesar Birotteau doing anything\nagainst the most rigid honor, nor against the laws, nor against his\nconscience, nor against delicacy. A man established and known for\neighteen years, to be suspected in his own household of dishonesty!\"\n\n\"Come, be calm, Cesar! A woman who has lived with you all that time\nknows down to the bottom of your soul. You are the master, after all.\nYou earned your fortune, didn't you? It is yours, and you can spend it.\nIf we are reduced to the last straits of poverty, neither your daughter\nnor I will make you a single reproach. But, listen; when you invented\nyour Paste of Sultans and Carminative Balm, what did you risk? Five or\nsix thousand francs. To-day you put all your fortune on a game of cards.\nAnd you are not the only one to play; you have associates who may be\nmuch cleverer than you. Give your ball, remodel the house, spend ten\nthousand francs if you like,--it is useless but not ruinous. As to your\nspeculations near the Madeleine, I formally object. You are perfumer: be\na perfumer, and not a speculator in land. We women have instincts which\ndo not deceive us. I have warned you; now follow your own lead. You have\nbeen judge in the department of commerce, you know the laws. So far,\nyou have guided the ship well, Cesar; I shall follow you! But I shall\ntremble till I see our fortune solidly secure and Cesarine well married.\nGod grant that my dream be not a prophecy!\"\n\nThis submission thwarted Birotteau, who now employed an innocent ruse to\nwhich he had had recourse on similar occasions.\n\n\"Listen, Constance. I have not given my word; though it is the same as\nif I had.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cesar, all is said; let us say no more. Honor before fortune. Come,\ngo to bed, dear friend, there is no more wood. Besides, we shall talk\nbetter in bed, if it amuses you. Oh! that horrid dream! My God! to see\none's self! it was fearful! Cesarine and I will have to make a pretty\nnumber of _neuvaines_ for the success of your speculations.\"\n\n\"Doubtless the help of God can do no harm,\" said Birotteau, gravely.\n\"But the oil in nuts is also powerful, wife. I made this discovery just\nas I made that of the Double Paste of Sultans,--by chance. The first\ntime by opening a book; this time by looking at an engraving of Hero\nand Leander: you know, the woman who pours oil on the head of her lover;\npretty, isn't it? The safest speculations are those which depend on\nvanity, on self-love, on the desire of appearing well. Those sentiments\nnever die.\"\n\n\"Alas! I know it well.\"\n\n\"At a certain age men will turn their souls inside out to get hair, if\nthey haven't any. For some time past hair-dressers have told me that\nthey sell not only Macassar, but all the drugs which are said to dye\nhair or make it grow. Since the peace, men are more with women, and\nwomen don't like bald-heads; hey! hey! Mimi? The demand for that article\ngrows out of the political situation. A composition which will keep the\nhair in good health will sell like bread; all the more if it has the\nsanction, as it will have, of the Academy of Sciences. My good Monsieur\nVauquelin will perhaps help me once more. I shall go to him to-morrow\nand submit my idea; offering him at the same time that engraving which\nI have at last found in Germany, after two years' search. He is\nnow engaged in analyzing hair: Chiffreville, his associate in the\nmanufacture of chemical products, told me so. If my discovery should\njump with his, my essence will be bought by both sexes. The idea is\na fortune; I repeat it. Mon Dieu! I can't sleep. Hey! luckily little\nPopinot has the finest head of hair in the world. A shop-girl with hair\nlong enough to touch the ground, and who could say--if the thing were\npossible without offence to God or my neighbor--that the Oil Comagene\n(for it shall be an oil, decidedly) has had something to do with\nit,--all the gray-heads in Paris will fling themselves upon the\ninvention like poverty upon the world. Hey! hey! Mignonne! how about the\nball? I am not wicked, but I should like to meet that little scamp du\nTillet, who swells out with his fortune and avoids me at the Bourse. He\nknows that I know a thing about him which was not fine. Perhaps I have\nbeen too kind to him. Isn't it odd, wife, that we are always punished\nfor our good deeds?--here below, I mean. I behaved like a father to him;\nyou don't know all I did for him.\"\n\n\"You give me goose-flesh merely speaking of it. If you knew what he\nwished to make of you, you would never have kept the secret of his\nstealing that three thousand francs,--for I guessed just how the thing\nwas done. If you had sent him to the correctional police, perhaps you\nwould have done a service to a good many people.\"\n\n\"What did he wish to make of me?\"\n\n\"Nothing. If you were inclined to listen to me to-night, I would give\nyou a piece of good advice, Birotteau; and that is, to let your du\nTillet alone.\"\n\n\"Won't it seem strange if I exclude him from my house,--a clerk for whom\nI endorsed to the amount of twenty thousand francs when he first went\ninto business? Come, let us do good for good's sake. Besides, perhaps du\nTillet has mended his ways.\"\n\n\"Everything is to be turned topsy-turvy, then?\"\n\n\"What do you mean with your topsy-turvy? Everything will be ruled like a\nsheet of music-paper. Have you forgotten what I have just told you\nabout turning the staircase and hiring the first floor of the next\nhouse?--which is all settled with the umbrella-maker, Cayron. He and I\nare going to-morrow to see his proprietor, Monsieur Molineux. To-morrow\nI have as much to do as a minister of state.\"\n\n\"You turn my brain with your projects,\" said Constance. \"I am all mixed\nup. Besides, Birotteau, I'm asleep.\"\n\n\"Good-day,\" replied the husband. \"Just listen; I say good-day because it\nis morning, Mimi. Ah! there she is off, the dear child. Yes! you shall\nbe rich, _richissime_, or I'll renounce my name of Cesar!\"\n\nA few moments later Constance and Cesar were peacefully snoring.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nA glance rapidly thrown over the past life of this household will\nstrengthen the ideas which ought to have been suggested by the friendly\naltercation of the two personages in this scene. While picturing the\nmanners and customs of retail shopkeepers, this sketch will also show by\nwhat singular chances Cesar Birotteau became deputy-mayor and perfumer,\nretired officer of the National Guard, and chevalier of the Legion of\nhonor. In bringing to light the depths of his character and the causes\nof his rise, we shall show that fortuitous commercial events which\nstrong brains dominate, may become irreparable catastrophes for weak\nones. Events are never absolute; their results depend on individuals.\nMisfortune is a stepping-stone for genius, the baptismal font of\nChristians, a treasure for the skilful man, an abyss for the feeble.\n\nA vine-dresser in the neighborhood of Chinon, named Jean Birotteau,\nmarried the waiting-maid of a lady whose vines he tilled. He had three\nsons; his wife died in giving birth to the last, and the poor man\ndid not long survive her. The mistress had been fond of the maid, and\nbrought up with her own sons the eldest child, Francois, and placed him\nin a seminary. Ordained priest, Francois Birotteau hid himself during\nthe Revolution, and led the wandering life of priests not sworn by the\nRepublic, hunted like wild beasts and guillotined at the first chance.\nAt the time when this history begins he was vicar of the cathedral of\nTours, and had only once left that city to visit his brother Cesar.\nThe bustle of Paris so bewildered the good priest that he was afraid to\nleave his room. He called the cabriolets \"half-coaches,\" and wondered at\nall he saw. After a week's stay he went back to Tours resolving never to\nrevisit the capital.\n\nThe second son of the vine-dresser, Jean Birotteau, was drafted into\nthe militia, and won the rank of captain early in the wars of the\nRevolution. At the battle of Trebia, Macdonald called for volunteers to\ncarry a battery. Captain Jean Birotteau advanced with his company, and\nwas killed. The destiny of the Birotteaus demanded, no doubt, that\nthey should be oppressed by men, or by circumstances, wheresoever they\nplanted themselves.\n\nThe last child is the hero of this story. When Cesar at fourteen years\nof age could read, write, and cipher, he left his native place and came\nto Paris on foot to seek his fortune, with one louis in his pocket. The\nrecommendation of an apothecary at Tours got him a place as shop-boy\nwith Monsieur and Madame Ragon, perfumers. Cesar owned at this period a\npair of hob-nailed shoes, a pair of breeches, blue stockings, a flowered\nwaistcoat, a peasant's jacket, three coarse shirts of good linen, and\nhis travelling cudgel. If his hair was cut like that of a choir-boy, he\nat least had the sturdy loins of a Tourangian; if he yielded sometimes\nto the native idleness of his birthplace, it was counterbalanced by his\ndesire to make his fortune; if he lacked cleverness and education,\nhe possessed an instinctive rectitude and delicate feelings, which he\ninherited from his mother,--a being who had, in Tourangian phrase, a\n\"heart of gold.\" Cesar received from the Ragons his food, six francs a\nmonth as wages, and a pallet to sleep upon in the garret near the cook.\nThe clerks who taught him to pack the goods, to do the errands, and\nsweep up the shop and the pavement, made fun of him as they did so,\naccording to the manners and customs of shop-keeping, in which chaff is\na principal element of instruction. Monsieur and Madame Ragon spoke to\nhim like a dog. No one paid attention to his weariness, though many a\nnight his feet, blistered by the pavements of Paris, and his bruised\nshoulders, made him suffer horribly. This harsh application of the maxim\n\"each for himself,\"--the gospel of large cities,--made Cesar think the\nlife of Paris very hard. At night he cried as he thought of Touraine,\nwhere the peasant works at his ease, where the mason lays a stone\nbetween breakfast and dinner, and idleness is wisely mingled with labor;\nbut he always fell asleep without having time to think of running away,\nfor he had his errands to do in the morning, and obeyed his duty with\nthe instinct of a watch-dog. If occasionally he complained, the head\nclerk would smile with a jovial air, and say,--\n\n\"Ah, my boy! all is not rose at 'The Queen of Roses.' Larks don't fall\ndown roasted; you must run after them and catch them, and then you must\nfind some way to cook them.\"\n\nThe cook, a big creature from Picardy, took the best bits for herself,\nand only spoke to Cesar when she wanted to complain of Monsieur and\nMadame Ragon, who left her nothing to steal. Towards the end of the\nfirst month this girl, who was forced to keep house of a Sunday, opened\na conversation with Cesar. Ursula with the grease washed off seemed\ncharming to the poor shop-boy, who, unless hindered by chance, was\nlikely to strike on the first rock that lay hidden in his way. Like all\nunprotected boys, he loved the first woman who threw him a kind look.\nThe cook took Cesar under her protection; and thence followed certain\nsecret relations, which the clerks laughed at pitilessly. Two years\nlater, the cook happily abandoned Cesar for a young recruit belonging to\nher native place who was then hiding in Paris,--a lad twenty years old,\nowning a few acres of land, who let Ursula marry him.\n\nDuring those two years the cook had fed her little Cesar well, and had\nexplained to him certain mysteries of Parisian life, which she made him\nlook at from the bottom; and she impressed upon him, out of jealousy, a\nprofound horror of evil places, whose dangers seemed not unknown to\nher. In 1792 the feet of the deserted Cesar were well-toughened to the\npavements, his shoulders to the bales, and his mind to what he called\nthe \"humbugs\" of Paris. So when Ursula abandoned him he was speedily\nconsoled, for she had realized none of his instinctive ideas in relation\nto sentiment. Licentious and surly, wheedling and pilfering, selfish\nand a tippler, she clashed with the simple nature of Birotteau without\noffering him any compensating perspective. Sometimes the poor lad felt\nwith pain that he was bound by ties that are strong enough to hold\ningenuous hearts to a creature with whom he could not sympathize. By the\ntime that he became master of his own heart he had reached his growth,\nand was sixteen years old. His mind, developed by Ursula and by the\nbanter of the clerks, made him study commerce with an eye in which\nintelligence was veiled beneath simplicity: he observed the customers;\nasked in leisure moments for explanations about the merchandise, whose\ndivers sorts and proper places he retained in his head. The day came\nwhen he knew all the articles, and their prices and marks, better than\nany new-comer; and from that time Monsieur and Madame Ragon made a\npractice of employing him in the business.\n\nWhen the terrible levy of the year II. made a clean sweep in the shop of\ncitizen Ragon, Cesar Birotteau, promoted to be second clerk, profited\nby the occasion to obtain a salary of fifty francs a month, and took\nhis seat at the dinner-table of the Ragons with ineffable delight. The\nsecond clerk of \"The Queen of Roses,\" possessing already six hundred\nfrancs, now had a chamber where he could put away, in long-coveted\narticles of furniture, the clothing he had little by little got\ntogether. Dressed like other young men of an epoch when fashion required\nthe assumption of boorish manners, the gentle and modest peasant had\nan air and manner which rendered him at least their equal; and he thus\npassed the barriers which in other times ordinary life would have placed\nbetween himself and the bourgeoisie. Towards the end of this year his\nintegrity won him a place in the counting-room. The dignified citoyenne\nRagon herself looked after his linen, and the two shopkeepers became\nfamiliar with him.\n\nIn Vendemiaire, 1794, Cesar, who possessed a hundred louis d'or, changed\nthem for six thousand francs in assignats, with which he bought into the\nFunds at thirty, paying for the investment on the very day before the\npaper began its course of depreciation at the Bourse, and locking up\nhis securities with unspeakable satisfaction. From that day forward he\nwatched the movement of stocks and public affairs with secret anxieties\nof his own, which made him quiver at each rumor of the reverses or\nsuccesses that marked this period of our history. Monsieur Ragon,\nformerly perfumer to her majesty Queen Marie-Antoinette, confided to\nCesar Birotteau, during this critical period, his attachment to the\nfallen tyrants. This disclosure was one of the cardinal events in\nCesar's life. The nightly conversations when the shop was closed, the\nstreet quiet, the accounts regulated, made a fanatic of the Tourangian,\nwho in becoming a royalist obeyed an inborn instinct. The recital of the\nvirtuous deeds of Louis XVI., the anecdotes with which husband and wife\nexalted the memory of the queen, fired the imagination of the young man.\nThe horrible fate of those two crowned heads, decapitated a few steps\nfrom the shop-door, roused his feeling heart and made him hate a system\nof government which was capable of shedding blood without repugnance.\nHis commercial interests showed him the death of trade in the Maximum,\nand in political convulsions, which are always destructive of business.\nMoreover, like a true perfumer, he hated the revolution which made a\nTitus of every man and abolished powder. The tranquillity resulting\nfrom absolutism could alone, he thought, give life to money, and he grew\nbigoted on behalf of royalty. When Monsieur Ragon saw that Cesar was\nwell-disposed on this point, he made him head-clerk and initiated him\ninto the secrets of \"The Queen of Roses,\" several of whose customers\nwere the most active and devoted emissaries of the Bourbons, and where\nthe correspondence between Paris and the West secretly went on. Carried\naway by the fervor of youth, electrified by his intercourse with the\nGeorges, the Billardiere, Montauran, Bauvan, Longuy, Manda, Bernier, du\nGuenic, and the Fontaines, Cesar flung himself into the conspiracy by\nwhich the royalists and the terrorists combined on the 13th Vendemiaire\nagainst the expiring Convention.\n\nOn that day Cesar had the honor of fighting against Napoleon on the\nsteps of Saint-Roch, and was wounded at the beginning of the affair.\nEvery one knows the result of that attempt. If the aide-de-camp of\nBarras then issued from his obscurity, the obscurity of Birotteau saved\nthe clerk's life. A few friends carried the belligerent perfumer to\n\"The Queen of Roses,\" where he remained hidden in the garret, nursed by\nMadame Ragon, and happily forgotten. Cesar Birotteau never had but that\none spurt of martial courage. During the month his convalescence lasted,\nhe made solid reflections on the absurdity of an alliance between\npolitics and perfumery. Although he remained royalist, he resolved to\nbe, purely and simply, a royalist perfumer, and never more to compromise\nhimself, body and soul, for his country.\n\nOn the 18th Brumaire, Monsieur and Madame Ragon, despairing of the royal\ncause, determined to give up perfumery, and live like honest bourgeois\nwithout meddling in politics. To recover the value of their business, it\nwas necessary to find a man who had more integrity than ambition,\nmore plain good sense than ability. Ragon proposed the affair to his\nhead-clerk. Birotteau, now master at twenty years of age of a thousand\nfrancs a year from the public Funds, hesitated. His ambition was to\nlive near Chinon as soon as he could get together an income of fifteen\nhundred francs, or whenever the First Consul should have consolidated\nthe public debt by consolidating himself in the Tuileries. Why should he\nrisk his honest and simple independence in commercial uncertainties? he\nasked himself. He had never expected to win so large a fortune, and he\nowed it to happy chances which only come in early youth; he intended\nto marry in Touraine some woman rich enough to enable him to buy and\ncultivate Les Tresorieres, a little property which, from the dawn of his\nreason, he had coveted, which he dreamed of augmenting, where he could\nmake a thousand crowns a year, and where he would lead a life of happy\nobscurity. He was about to refuse the offer, when love suddenly changed\nall his resolutions by increasing tenfold the measure of his ambition.\n\nAfter Ursula's desertion, Cesar had remained virtuous, as much through\nfear of the dangers of Paris as from application to his work. When\nthe passions are without food they change their wants; marriage then\nbecomes, to persons of the middle class, a fixed idea, for it is their\nonly way of winning and appropriating a woman. Cesar Birotteau had\nreached that point. Everything at \"The Queen of Roses\" now rested on\nthe head-clerk; he had not a moment to give to pleasure. In such a life\nwants become imperious, and a chance meeting with a beautiful young\nwoman, of whom a libertine clerk would scarcely have dreamed, produced\non Cesar an overpowering effect. On a fine June day, crossing by the\nPont-Marie to the Ile Saint-Louis, he saw a young girl standing at the\ndoor of a shop at the angle of the Quai d'Anjou. Constance Pillerault\nwas the forewoman of a linen-draper's establishment called Le Petit\nMatelot,--the first of those shops which have since been established in\nParis with more or less of painted signs, floating banners, show-cases\nfilled with swinging shawls, cravats arranged like houses of cards, and\na thousand other commercial seductions, such as fixed prices, fillets\nof suspended objects, placards, illusions and optical effects carried\nto such a degree of perfection that a shop-front has now become a\ncommercial poem. The low price of all the articles called \"Novelties\"\nwhich were to be found at the Petit-Matelot gave the shop an unheard\nof vogue, and that in a part of Paris which was the least favorable to\nfashion and commerce. The young forewoman was at this time cited for her\nbeauty, as was the case in later days with the beautiful lemonade-girl\nof the cafe of the Milles Colonnnes, and several other poor creatures\nwho flattened more noses, young and old, against the window-panes of\nmilliners, confectioners, and linen-drapers, than there are stones in\nthe streets of Paris.\n\nThe head-clerk of \"The Queen of Roses,\" living between Saint-Roch\nand the Rue de la Sourdiere, knew nothing of the existence of the\nPetit-Matelot; for the smaller trades of Paris are more or less\nstrangers to each other. Cesar was so vigorously smitten by the beauty\nof Constance that he rushed furiously into the shop to buy six linen\nshirts, disputing the price a long time, and requiring volumes of linen\nto be unfolded and shown to him, precisely like an Englishwoman in the\nhumor for \"shopping.\" The young person deigned to take notice of Cesar,\nperceiving, by certain symptoms known to women, that he came more for\nthe seller than the goods. He dictated his name and address to the young\nlady, who grew very indifferent to the admiration of her customer once\nthe purchase was made. The poor clerk had had little to do to win the\ngood graces of Ursula; in such matters he was as silly as a sheep, and\nlove now made him sillier. He dared not utter a word, and was moreover\ntoo dazzled to observe the indifference which succeeded the smiles of\nthe siren shopwoman.\n\nFor eight succeeding days Cesar mounted guard every evening before the\nPetit-Matelot, watching for a look as a dog waits for a bone at\nthe kitchen door, indifferent to the derision of the clerks and the\nshop-girls, humbly stepping aside for the buyers and passers-by, and\nabsorbed in the little revolving world of the shop. Some days later he\nagain entered the paradise of his angel, less to purchase handkerchiefs\nthan to communicate to her a luminous idea.\n\n\"If you should have need of perfumery, Mademoiselle, I could furnish you\nin the same manner,\" he said as he paid for the handkerchiefs.\n\nConstance Pillerault was daily receiving brilliant proposals, in which\nthere was no question of marriage; and though her heart was as pure\nas her forehead was white, it was only after six months of marches\nand counter-marches, in the course of which Cesar revealed his\ninextinguishable love, that she condescended to receive his attentions,\nand even then without committing herself to an answer,--a prudence\nsuggested by the number of her swains, wholesale wine-merchants, rich\nproprietors of cafes, and others who made soft eyes at her. The lover\nwas backed up in his suit by the guardian of Constance, Monsieur\nClaude-Joseph Pillerault, at that time an ironmonger on the Quai de la\nFerraille, whom the young man had finally discovered by devoting himself\nto the subterraneous spying which distinguishes a genuine love.\n\nThe rapidity of this narrative compels us to pass over in silence the\njoys of Parisian love tasted with innocence, the prodigalities peculiar\nto clerkdom, such as melons in their earliest prime, choice dinners\nat Venua's followed by the theatre, Sunday jaunts to the country in\nhackney-coaches. Without being handsome, there was nothing in Cesar's\nperson which made it difficult to love him. The life of Paris and\nhis sojourn in a dark shop had dulled the brightness of his peasant\ncomplexion. His abundant black hair, his solid neck and shoulders\nlike those of a Norman horse, his sturdy limbs, his honest and\nstraightforward manner, all contributed to predispose others in his\nfavor. The uncle Pillerault, whose duty it was to watch over the\nhappiness of his brother's daughter, made inquiries which resulted in\nhis sanctioning the wishes of the young Tourangian. In the year 1800,\nand in the pretty month of May, Mademoiselle Pillerault consented to\nmarry Cesar Birotteau, who fainted with joy at the moment when, under a\nlinden at Sceaux, Constance-Barbe-Josephine Pillerault accepted him as\nher husband.\n\n\"My little girl,\" said Monsieur Pillerault, \"you have won a good\nhusband. He has a warm heart and honorable feelings; he is true as gold,\nand as good as an infant Jesus,--in fact, a king of men.\"\n\nConstance frankly abdicated the more brilliant destiny to which, like\nall shop-girls, she may at times have aspired. She wished to be an\nhonest woman, a good mother of a family, and looked at life according to\nthe religious programme of the middle classes. Such a career suited her\nown ideas far better than the dangerous vanities which seduce so many\nyouthful Parisian imaginations. Constance, with her narrow intelligence,\nwas a type of the petty bourgeoisie whose labors are not performed\nwithout grumbling; who begin by refusing what they desire, and end\nby getting angry when taken at their word; whose restless activity is\ncarried into the kitchen and into the counting-room, into the gravest\nmatters of business, and into the invisible darns of the household\nlinen; who love while scolding, who conceive no ideas but the simplest\n(the small change of the mind); who argue about everything, fear\neverything, calculate everything, and fret perpetually over the future.\nHer cold but ingenuous beauty, her touching expression, her freshness\nand purity, prevented Birotteau from thinking of her defects, which\nmoreover were more than compensated by a delicate sense of honor natural\nto women, by an excessive love of order, by a fanaticism for work, and\nby her genius as a saleswoman. Constance was eighteen years old, and\npossessed eleven thousand francs of her own. Cesar, inspired by his love\nwith an excessive ambition, bought the business of \"The Queen of Roses\"\nand removed it to a handsome building near the Place Vendome. At the\nearly age of twenty-one, married to a woman he adored, the proprietor of\nan establishment for which he had paid three quarters of the price down,\nhe had the right to view, and did view, the future in glowing colors;\nall the more when he measured the path which led from his original point\nof departure. Roguin, notary of Ragon, who had drawn up the marriage\ncontract, gave the new perfumer some sound advice, and prevented him\nfrom paying the whole purchase money down with the fortune of his wife.\n\n\"Keep the means of undertaking some good enterprise, my lad,\" he had\nsaid to him.\n\nBirotteau looked up to the notary with admiration, fell into the habit\nof consulting him, and made him his friend. Like Ragon and Pillerault,\nhe had so much faith in the profession that he gave himself up to Roguin\nwithout allowing himself a suspicion. Thanks to this advice, Cesar,\nsupplied with the eleven thousand francs of his wife for his start in\nbusiness, would have scorned to exchange his possessions for those of\nthe First Consul, brilliant as the prospects of Napoleon might seem. At\nfirst the Birotteaus kept only a cook, and lived in the _entresol_ above\nthe shop,--a sort of den tolerably well decorated by an upholsterer,\nwhere the bride and bridegroom began a honeymoon that was never to end.\nMadame Cesar appeared to advantage behind the counter. Her celebrated\nbeauty had an enormous influence upon the sales, and the beautiful\nMadame Birotteau became a topic among the fashionable young men of\nthe Empire. If Cesar was sometimes accused of royalism, the world did\njustice to his honesty; if a few neighboring shopkeepers envied his\nhappiness, every one at least thought him worthy of it. The bullet which\nstruck him on the steps of Saint-Roch gave him the reputation of\nbeing mixed up with political secrets, and also of being a courageous\nman,--though he had no military courage in his heart, and not the\nsmallest political idea in his brain. Upon these grounds the worthy\npeople of the arrondissement made him captain of the National Guard; but\nhe was cashiered by Napoleon, who, according to Birotteau, owed him a\ngrudge for their encounter on the 13th Vendemiaire. Cesar thus obtained\nat a cheap rate a varnish of persecution, which made him interesting in\nthe eyes of the opposition, and gave him a certain importance.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nSuch was the history of this household, lastingly happy through its\nfeeling, and agitated only by commercial anxieties.\n\nDuring the first year Cesar instructed his wife about the sales of\ntheir merchandise and the details of perfumery,--a business which she\nunderstood admirably. She really seemed to have been created and sent\ninto the world to fit on the gloves of customers. At the close of that\nyear the assets staggered our ambitious perfumer; all costs calculated,\nhe would be able in less than twenty years to make a modest capital of\none hundred thousand francs, which was the sum at which he estimated\ntheir happiness. He then resolved to reach fortune more rapidly, and\ndetermined to manufacture articles as well as retail them. Contrary to\nthe advice of his wife, he hired some sheds, with the ground about\nthem, in the Faubourg du Temple, and painted upon them in big letters,\n\"Manufactory of Cesar Birotteau.\" He enticed a skilful workman from\nGrasse, with whom he began, on equal shares, the manufacture of soaps,\nessences, and eau-de-cologne. His connection with this man lasted only\nsix months, and ended by losses which fell upon him alone. Without\nallowing himself to be discouraged, Birotteau determined to get better\nresults at any price, solely to avoid being scolded by his wife,--to\nwhom he acknowledged later that in those depressing days his head had\nboiled like a saucepan, and that several times, if it had not been for\nhis religious sentiments, he should have flung himself into the Seine.\n\nHarassed by some unprofitable enterprise, he was lounging one day along\nthe boulevard on his way to dinner,--for the Parisian lounger is as\noften a man filled with despair as an idler,--when among a parcel of\nbooks for six sous a-piece, laid out in a hamper on the pavement, his\neyes lighted on the following title, yellow with dust: \"Abdeker, or the\nArt of Preserving Beauty.\" He picked up the so-called Arab book, a sort\nof romance written by a physician of the preceding century, and happened\non a page which related to perfumes. Leaning against a tree on the\nboulevard to turn over the leaves at his ease, he read a note by the\nauthor which explained the nature of the skin and the cuticle, and\nshowed that a certain soap, or a certain paste, often produced effects\nquite contrary to those expected of them, if the soap and the paste\ntoned up a skin which needed relaxing, or relaxed a skin which\nrequired tones. Birotteau bought the book, in which he saw his fortune.\nNevertheless, having little confidence in his own lights, he consulted a\ncelebrated chemist, Vauquelin, from whom he naively inquired how to mix\na two-sided cosmetic which should produce effects appropriate to the\ndiversified nature of the human epidermis. Truly scientific men--men who\nare really great in the sense that they never attain in their lifetime\nthe renown which their immense and unrecognized labors deserve--are\nnearly always kind, and willing to serve the poor in spirit. Vauquelin\naccordingly patronized the perfumer, and allowed him to call himself\nthe inventor of a paste to whiten the hands, the composition of which\nhe dictated to him. Birotteau named this cosmetic the \"Double Paste\nof Sultans.\" To complete the work, he applied the same recipe to\nthe manufacture of a lotion for the complexion, which he called the\n\"Carminative Balm.\" He imitated in his own line the system of the\nPetit-Matelot, and was the first perfumer to display that redundancy\nof placards, advertisements, and other methods of publication which are\ncalled, perhaps unjustly, charlatanism.\n\nThe Paste of Sultans and the Carminative Balm were ushered into the\nworld of fashion and commerce by colored placards, at the head of which\nwere these words, \"Approved by the Institute.\" This formula, used for\nthe first time, had a magical effect. Not only all France, but the\ncontinent flaunted with the posters, yellow, red, and blue, of the\nmonarch of the \"The Queen of Roses,\" who kept in stock, supplied, and\nmanufactured, at moderate prices, all that belonged to his trade. At\na period when nothing was talked of but the East, to name any sort of\ncosmetic the \"Paste of Sultans\" thus divining the magic force of such\nwords in a land where every man hoped to be a sultan as much as every\nwoman longed to be a sultana, was an inspiration which could only have\ncome to a common man or a man of genius. The public always judges by\nresults. Birotteau passed for a superior man, commercially speaking; all\nthe more because he compiled a prospectus whose ridiculous phraseology\nwas an element of success. In France they only made fun of things which\noccupy the public mind, and the public does not occupy itself with\nthings that do not succeed. Though Birotteau perpetrated this folly in\ngood faith and not as a trick, the world gave him credit for knowing how\nto play the fool for a purpose. We have found, not without difficulty,\na copy of this prospectus at the establishment of Popinot and Co.,\ndruggists, Rue des Lombards. This curious document belongs to the class\nwhich, in a higher sphere, historians call _pieces justificatives_. We\ngive it here:\n\n\n                     THE DOUBLE PASTE OF SULTANS\n\n                        AND CARMINATIVE BALM\n\n                         Of Cesar Birotteau.\n\n                        MARVELLOUS DISCOVERY!\n\n                 Approved by the Institute of France.\n\n\n  \"For many years a paste for the hands and a lotion for the face\n  offering superior results to those obtained from Eau-de-Cologne in\n  the domain of the toilet, has been widely sought by both sexes in\n  Europe. Devoting long vigils to the study of the skin and cuticle\n  of the two sexes, each of whom, one as much as the other, attach\n  the utmost importance to the softness, suppleness, brilliancy, and\n  velvet texture of the complexion, the Sieur Birotteau, perfumer,\n  favorably known in this metropolis and abroad, has discovered a\n  Paste and a Lotion justly hailed as marvellous by the fashion and\n  elegance of Paris. In point of fact, this Paste and this Lotion\n  possess amazing properties which act upon the skin without\n  prematurely wrinkling it,--the inevitable result of drugs\n  thoughtlessly employed, and sold in these days by ignorance and\n  cupidity. This discovery rests upon diversities of temperament,\n  which divide themselves into two great classes, indicated by the\n  color of the Paste and the Lotion, which will be found _pink_ for\n  the skin and cuticle of persons of lymphatic habit, and _white_\n  for those possessed of a sanguine temperament.\n\n  \"This Paste is named the 'Paste of Sultans,' because the discovery\n  was originally made for the Seraglio by an Arabian physician. It\n  has been approved by the Institute on the recommendation of our\n  illustrious chemist, Vauquelin; together with the Lotion,\n  fabricated on the same principles which govern the composition of\n  the Paste.\n\n  \"This precious Paste, exhaling as it does the sweetest perfumes,\n  removes all blotches, even those that are obstinately rebellious,\n  whitens the most recalcitrant epidermis, and dissipates the\n  perspirations of the hand, of which both sexes equally complain.\n\n  \"The Carminative Balm will disperse the little pimples which\n  appear inopportunely at certain times, and interfere with a lady's\n  projects for a ball; it refreshes and revives the color by opening\n  or shutting the pores of the skin according to the exigencies of\n  the individual temperament. It is so well known already for its\n  effect in arresting the ravages of time that many, out of\n  gratitude, have called it the 'Friend of Beauty.'\n\n  \"Eau-de-Cologne is, purely and simply, a trivial perfume without\n  special efficacy of any kind; while the Double Paste of Sultans\n  and the Carminative Balm are two operative compounds, of a motive\n  power which acts without risk upon the internal energies and\n  seconds them. Their perfumes (essentially balsamic, and of a\n  stimulating character which admirably revives the heart and brain)\n  awake ideas and vivify them; they are as wonderful for their\n  simplicity as for their merits. In short, they offer one\n  attraction the more to women, and to men a means of seduction\n  which it is within their power to secure.\n\n  \"The daily use of the Balm will relieve the smart occasioned by\n  the heat of the razor; it will protect the lips from chapping, and\n  restore their color; it dispels in time all discolorations, and\n  revives the natural tones of the skin. Such results demonstrate in\n  man a perfect equilibrium of the juices of life, which tends to\n  relieve all persons subject to headache from the sufferings of\n  that horrible malady. Finally, the Carminative Balm, which can be\n  employed by women in all stages of their toilet, will prevent\n  cutaneous diseases by facilitating the transpiration of the\n  tissues, and communicating to them a permanent texture like that\n  of velvet.\n\n  \"Address, post-paid, Monsieur Cesar Birotteau, successor to Ragon,\n  former perfumer to the Queen Marie Antoinette, at The Queen of\n  Roses, Rue Saint-Honore, Paris, near the Place Vendome.\n\n  \"The price of a cake of Paste is three francs; that of the bottle\n  six francs.\n\n  \"Monsieur Cesar Birotteau, to avoid counterfeits, informs the\n  public that the Paste is wrapped in paper bearing his signature,\n  and that the bottles have a stamp blown in the glass.\"\n\n\nThe success was owing, without Cesar's suspecting it, to Constance,\nwho advised him to send cases of the Carminative Balm and the Paste of\nSultans to all perfumers in France and in foreign cities, offering them\nat the same time a discount of thirty per cent if they would buy the two\narticles by the gross. The Paste and the Balm were, in reality, worth\nmore than other cosmetics of the sort; and they captivated ignorant\npeople by the distinctions they set up among the temperaments. The\nfive hundred perfumers of France, allured by the discount, each bought\nannually from Birotteau more than three hundred gross of the Paste and\nthe Lotion,--a consumption which, if it gave only a limited profit on\neach article, became enormous considered in bulk. Cesar was then able\nto buy the huts and the land in the Faubourg du Temple; he built large\nmanufactories, and decorated his shop at \"The Queen of Roses\" with\nmuch magnificence; his household began to taste the little joys of\ncompetence, and his wife no longer trembled as before.\n\nIn 1810 Madame Cesar, foreseeing a rise in rents, pushed her husband\ninto becoming chief tenant of the house where they had hitherto occupied\nonly the shop and the _entresol_, and advised him to remove their own\nappartement to the first floor. A fortunate event induced Constance to\nshut her eyes to the follies which Birotteau committed for her sake in\nfitting up the new appartement. The perfumer had just been elected judge\nin the commercial courts: his integrity, his well-known sense of honor,\nand the respect he enjoyed, earned for him this dignity, which ranked\nhim henceforth among the leading merchants of Paris. To improve his\nknowledge, he rose daily at five o'clock, and read law-reports and books\ntreating of commercial litigation. His sense of justice, his rectitude,\nhis conscientious intentions,--qualities essential to the understanding\nof questions submitted for consular decision,--soon made him highly\nesteemed among the judges. His defects contributed not a little to his\nreputation. Conscious of his inferiority, Cesar subordinated his own\nviews to those of his colleagues, who were flattered in being thus\ndeferred to. Some sought the silent approbation of a man held to be\nsagacious, in his capacity of listener; others, charmed with his modesty\nand gentleness, praised him publicly. Plaintiffs and defendants extolled\nhis kindness, his conciliatory spirit; and he was often chosen umpire in\ncontests where his own good sense would have suggested the swift justice\nof a Turkish cadi. During his whole period in office he contrived to\nuse language which was a medley of commonplaces mixed with maxims\nand computations served up in flowing phrases mildly put forth, which\nsounded to the ears of superficial people like eloquence. Thus he\npleased that great majority, mediocre by nature, who are condemned\nto perpetual labor and to views which are of the earth earthy. Cesar,\nhowever, lost so much time in court that his wife obliged him finally to\nresign the expensive dignity.\n\nTowards 1813, the Birotteau household, thanks to its constant harmony,\nand after steadily plodding on through life, saw the dawn of an era of\nprosperity which nothing seemed likely to interrupt. Monsieur and Madame\nRagon, their predecessors, the uncle Pillerault, Roguin the notary, the\nMessrs. Matifat, druggists in the Rue des Lombards and purveyors to\n\"The Queen of Roses,\" Joseph Lebas, woollen draper and successor to\nthe Messrs. Guillaume at the Maison du Chat-qui-pelote (one of the\nluminaries of the Rue Saint-Denis), Popinot the judge, brother of Madame\nRagon, Chiffreville of the firm of Protez & Chiffreville, Monsieur and\nMadame Cochin, employed in the treasury department and sleeping partners\nin the house of Matifat, the Abbe Loraux, confessor and director of the\npious members of this coterie, with a few other persons, made up\nthe circle of their friends. In spite of the royalist sentiments of\nBirotteau, public opinion was in his favor; he was considered very rich,\nthough in fact he possessed only a hundred thousand francs over and\nabove his business. The regularity of his affairs, his punctuality, his\nhabit of making no debts, of never discounting his paper, and of taking,\non the contrary, safe securities from those whom he could thus oblige,\ntogether with his general amiability, won him enormous credit. His\nhousehold cost him nearly twenty thousand francs a year, and the\neducation of Cesarine, an only daughter, idolized by Constance as well\nas by himself, necessitated heavy expenses. Neither husband nor wife\nconsidered money when it was a question of giving pleasure to their\nchild, from whom they had never been willing to separate. Imagine the\nhappiness of the poor parvenu peasant as he listened to his charming\nCesarine playing a sonata of Steibelt's on the piano, and singing a\nballad; or when he found her writing the French language correctly,\nor reading Racine, father and son, and explaining their beauties, or\nsketching a landscape, or painting in sepia! What joy to live again in\na flower so pure, so lovely, which had never left the maternal stem;\nan angel whose budding graces and whose earliest developments he had\npassionately watched; an only daughter, incapable of despising her\nfather, or of ridiculing his defective education, so truly was she an\ningenuous young girl.\n\nWhen he first came to Paris, Cesar had known how to read, write, and\ncipher, but his education stopped there; his laborious life had kept him\nfrom acquiring ideas and knowledge outside the business of perfumery.\nMixing wholly with people to whom science and letters were of no\nimportance, and whose information did not go beyond their specialty,\nhaving no time to give to higher studies, the perfumer had become a\nmerely practical man. He adopted necessarily the language, blunders, and\nopinions of the bourgeois of Paris, who admires Moliere, Voltaire, and\nRousseau on faith, and buys their books without ever reading them; who\nmaintains that people should say _ormoires_, because women put away\ntheir gold and their dresses and moire in those articles of furniture,\nand that it is only a corruption of the language to say _armoires_.\nPotier, Talma, and Mademoiselle Mars were ten times millionaires, and\ndid not live like other human beings; the great tragedian ate raw meat,\nand Mademoiselle Mars sometimes drank dissolved pearls, in imitation of\na celebrated Egyptian actress. The Emperor had leather pockets in his\nwaistcoat, so that he could take his snuff by the handful; he rode on\nhorseback at full gallop up the stairway of the orangery at Versailles.\nWriters and artists died in the hospital, as a natural consequence of\ntheir eccentricities; they were, moreover, all atheists, and people\nshould be very careful not to admit them into their households. Joseph\nLebas cited with horror the history of his step-sister Augustine's\nmarriage with the painter Sommervieux. Astronomers lived on spiders.\n\nThese striking points of information on the French language, on dramatic\nart, politics, literature, and science, will explain the bearings of\nthe bourgeois intellect. A poet passing through the Rue des Lombards\nmay dream of Araby as he inhales certain perfumes. He may admire the\n_danseuses_ in a _chauderie_, as he breathes the odors of an Indian\nroot. Dazzled by the blaze of cochineal, he recalls the poems of the\nVeda, the religion of Brahma and its castes; brushing against piles of\nivory in the rough, he mounts the backs of elephants; seated in a muslin\ncage, he makes love like the King of Lahore. But the little retail\nmerchant is ignorant from whence have come, or where may grow, the\nproducts in which he deals. Birotteau, perfumer, did not know an iota of\nnatural history, nor of chemistry. Though regarding Vauquelin as a great\nman, he thought him an exception,--of about the same capacity as the\nretired grocer who summed up a discussion on the method of importing\nteas, by remarking with a knowing air, \"There are but two ways: tea\ncomes either by caravan, or by Havre.\" According to Birotteau aloes and\nopium were only to be found in the Rue des Lombards. Rosewater, said to\nbe brought from Constantinople, was made in Paris like eau-de-cologne.\nThe names of these places were shams, invented to please Frenchmen who\ncould not endure the things of their own country. A French merchant\nmust call his discoveries English to make them fashionable, just as in\nEngland the druggists attribute theirs to France.\n\nNevertheless, Cesar was incapable of being wholly stupid or a fool.\nHonesty and goodness cast upon all the acts of his life a light which\nmade them creditable; for noble conduct makes even ignorance seem\nworthy. Success gave him confidence. In Paris confidence is accepted as\npower, of which it is the outward sign. As for Madame Birotteau, having\nmeasured Cesar during the first three years of their married life,\nshe was a prey to continual terror. She represented in their union the\nsagacious and fore-casting side,--doubt, opposition, and fear; while\nCesar, on the other hand, was the embodiment of audacity, energy,\nand the inexpressible delights of fatalism. Yet in spite of these\nappearances the husband often quaked, while the wife, in reality, was\npossessed of patience and true courage.\n\nThus it happened that a man who was both mediocre and pusillanimous,\nwithout education, without ideas, without knowledge, without force of\ncharacter, and who might be expected not to succeed in the slipperiest\ncity in the world, came by his principles of conduct, by his sense\nof justice, by the goodness of a heart that was truly Christian, and\nthrough his love for the only woman he had really won, to be considered\nas a remarkable man, courageous, and full of resolution. The public saw\nresults only. Excepting Pillerault and Popinot the judge, all the people\nof his own circle knew him superficially, and were unable to judge him.\nMoreover, the twenty or thirty friends he had collected about him talked\nthe same nonsense, repeated the same commonplaces, and all thought\nthemselves superior in their own line. The women vied with each other\nin dress and good dinners; each had said her all when she dropped a\ncontemptuous word about her husband. Madame Birotteau alone had the good\nsense to treat hers with honor and respect in public; she knew him to\nbe a man who, in spite of his secret disabilities, had earned their\nfortune, and whose good name she shared. It is true that she sometimes\nasked herself what sort of world this could be, if all the men who were\nthought superior were like her husband. Such conduct contributed not a\nlittle to maintain the respectful esteem bestowed upon the perfumer in\na community where women are much inclined to complain of their husbands\nand bring them into discredit.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThe first days of the year 1814, so fatal to imperial France, were\nmarked at the Birotteaus by two events, not especially remarkable in\nother households, but of a nature to impress such simple souls as Cesar\nand his wife, who casting their eyes along the past could find nothing\nbut tender memories. They had taken as head-clerk a young man twenty-two\nyears of age, named Ferdinand du Tillet. This lad--who had just left\na perfumery where he was refused a share in the business, and who was\nreckoned a genius--had made great efforts to get employed at \"The Queen\nof Roses,\" whose methods, facilities, and customs were well known to\nhim. Birotteau took him, and gave him a salary of a thousand francs,\nintending to make him eventually his successor.\n\nFerdinand had so great an influence on the destinies of this family that\nit is necessary to say a few words about him. In the first place he was\nnamed simply Ferdinand, without surname. This anonymous condition seemed\nto him an immense advantage at the time when Napoleon conscripted all\nfamilies to fill the ranks. He was, however, born somewhere, as the\nresult of some cruel and voluptuous caprice. The following are the\nonly facts preserved about his civil condition. In 1793 a poor girl of\nTillet, a village near Andelys, came by night and gave birth to a child\nin the garden of the curate of the church at Tillet, and after rapping\non the window-shutters went away and drowned herself. The good priest\ntook the child, gave him the name of the saint inscribed on the calendar\nfor that day, and fed and brought him up as his own son. The curate died\nin 1804, without leaving enough property to carry on the education he\nhad begun. Ferdinand, thrown upon Paris, led a filibustering life whose\nchances might bring him to the scaffold, to fortune, the bar, the army,\ncommerce, or domestic life. Obliged to live like a Figaro, he was first\na commercial traveller, then a perfumer's clerk in Paris, where he\nturned up after traversing all France, having studied the world and made\nup his mind to succeed at any price.\n\nIn 1813 Ferdinand thought it necessary to register his age, and obtain\na civil standing by applying to the courts at Andelys for a judgment,\nwhich should enable his baptismal record to be transferred from the\nregistry of the parish to that of the mayor's office; and he obtained\npermission to rectify the document by inserting the name of du Tillet,\nunder which he was known, and which legally belonged to him through the\nfact of his exposure and abandonment in that township. Without father,\nmother, or other guardian than the _procureur imperial_, alone in the\nworld and owing no duty to any man, he found society a hard stepmother,\nand he handled it, in his turn, without gloves,--as the Turks the Moors;\nhe knew no guide but his own interests, and any means to fortune he\nconsidered good. This young Norman, gifted with dangerous abilities,\ncoupled his desires for success with the harsh defects which, justly\nor unjustly, are attributed to the natives of his province. A wheedling\nmanner cloaked a quibbling mind, for he was in truth a hard judicial\nwrangler. But if he boldly contested the rights of others, he certainly\nyielded none of his own; he attacked his adversary at the right moment,\nand wearied him out with his inflexible persistency. His merits were\nthose of the Scapins of ancient comedy; he had their fertility of\nresource, their cleverness in skirting evil, their itching to lay hold\nof all that was good to keep. In short, he applied to his own poverty a\nsaying which the Abbe Terray uttered in the name of the State,--he\nkept a loophole to become in after years an honest man. Gifted with\npassionate energy, with a boldness that was almost military in requiring\ngood as well as evil actions from those about him, and justifying such\ndemands on the theory of personal interest, he despised men too much,\nbelieving them all corruptible, he was too unscrupulous in the choice of\nmeans, thinking all equally good, he was too thoroughly convinced that\nthe success of money was the absolution of all moral mechanism, not to\nattain his ends sooner or later.\n\nSuch a man, standing between the hulks and a vast fortune, was\nnecessarily vindictive, domineering, quick in decisions, yet as\ndissimulating as a Cromwell planning to decapitate the head of\nintegrity. His real depth was hidden under a light and jesting\nmind. Mere clerk as he was, his ambition knew no bounds. With one\ncomprehensive glance of hatred he had taken in the whole of society,\nsaying boldly to himself, \"Thou shalt be mine!\" He had vowed not to\nmarry till he was forty, and kept his word. Physically, Ferdinand was a\ntall, slender young man, with a good figure and adaptive manners, which\nenabled him to take, on occasion, the key-note of the various societies\nin which he found himself. His ignoble face was rather pleasant at first\nsight; but later, on closer acquaintance, expressions were caught such\nas come to the surface of those who are ill at ease in their own minds,\nand whose consciences groan at certain times. His complexion, which was\nsanguine under the soft skin of a Norman, had a crude or acrid color.\nThe glance of his eye, whose iris was circled with a whitish rim as if\nit were lined with silver, was evasive yet terrible when he fixed it\nstraight upon his victim. His voice had a hollow sound, like that of\na man worn out with much speaking. His thin lips were not wanting in\ncharm, but his pointed nose and slightly projecting forehead showed\ndefects of race; and his hair, of a tint like hair that has been dyed\nblack, indicated a mongrel descent, through which he derived his mental\nqualities from some libertine lord, his low instincts from a seduced\npeasant-girl, his knowledge from an incomplete education, and his vices\nfrom his deserted and abandoned condition.\n\nBirotteau discovered with much amazement that his clerk went out in\nthe evening very elegantly dressed, came home late, and was seen at the\nballs of bankers and notaries. Such habits displeased Cesar, according\nto whose ideas clerks should study the books of the firm and think only\nof their business. The worthy man was shocked by trifles, and reproached\ndu Tillet gently for wearing linen that was too fine, for leaving cards\non which his name was inscribed, F. du Tillet,--a fashion, according\nto commercial jurisprudence, which belonged only to the great world.\nFerdinand had entered the employ of this Orgon with the intentions of a\nTartuffe. He paid court to Madame Cesar, tried to seduce her, and\njudged his master very much as the wife judged him herself, and all with\nalarming rapidity. Though discreet, reserved, and accustomed to say only\nwhat he meant to say, du Tillet unbosomed his opinions on men and life\nin a way to shock a scrupulous woman who shared the religious feelings\nof her husband, and who thought it a crime to do the least harm to a\nneighbor. In spite of Madame Birotteau's caution, du Tillet suspected\nthe contempt in which she held him. Constance, to whom Ferdinand had\nwritten a few love-letters, soon noticed a change in his manners, which\ngrew presuming, as if intended to convey the idea of a mutual good\nunderstanding. Without giving the secret reason to her husband, she\nadvised him to send Ferdinand away. Birotteau agreed with his wife, and\nthe dismissal was determined upon.\n\nTwo days before it was carried into effect, on a Saturday night when\nBirotteau was making up his monthly accounts, three thousand francs were\nfound to be missing. His consternation was dreadful, less for the\nloss than for the suspicions which fell upon three clerks, one cook, a\nshop-boy, and several habitual workmen. On whom should he lay the blame?\nMadame Birotteau never left her counter. The clerk who had charge of the\ndesk was a nephew of Monsieur Ragon named Popinot, a young man nineteen\nyears old, who lived with the Birotteaus and was integrity itself.\nHis figures, which disagreed with the money in the desk, revealed the\ndeficit, and showed that the abstraction had been made after the balance\nhad been added up. Husband and wife resolved to keep silence and watch\nthe house. On the following day, Sunday, they received their friends.\nThe families who made up their coterie met at each other's houses for\nlittle festivities, turn and turn about. While playing at _bouillote_,\nRoguin the notary placed on the card-table some old louis d'or which\nMadame Cesar had taken only a few days before from a bride, Madame\nd'Espart.\n\n\"Have you been robbing the poor-box?\" asked the perfumer, laughing.\n\nRoguin replied that he had won the money, at the house of a banker,\nfrom du Tillet, who confirmed the answer without blushing. Cesar, on\nthe other hand, grew scarlet. When the evening was over, and just\nas Ferdinand was going to bed, Birotteau took him into the shop on a\npretext of business.\n\n\"Du Tillet,\" said the worthy man, \"three thousand francs are missing\nfrom the desk. I suspect no one; but the circumstance of the old louis\nseems too much against you not to oblige me to speak of it. We will not\ngo to bed till we have found where the error lies,--for, after all,\nit may be only an error. Perhaps you took something on account of your\nsalary?\"\n\nDu Tillet said at once that he had taken the louis. The perfumer opened\nhis ledger and found that his clerk's account had not been debited.\n\n\"I was in a hurry; but I ought to have made Popinot enter the sum,\" said\nFerdinand.\n\n\"That is true,\" said Birotteau, bewildered by the cool unconcern of the\nNorman, who well knew the worthy people among whom he had come meaning\nto make his fortune. The perfumer and his clerk passed the whole night\nin examining accounts, a labor which the good man knew to be useless. In\ncoming and going about the desk Cesar slipped three bills of a thousand\nfrancs each into the money-drawer, catching them against the top of it;\nthen he pretended to be much fatigued and to fall asleep and snore.\nDu Tillet awoke him triumphantly, with an excessive show of joy at\ndiscovering the error. The next day Birotteau scolded Popinot and his\nlittle wife publicly, as if very angry with them for their negligence.\nFifteen days later Ferdinand du Tillet got a situation with a\nstockbroker. He said perfumery did not suit him, and he wished to learn\nbanking. In leaving Birotteau, he spoke of Madame Cesar in a way to make\npeople suppose that his master had dismissed him out of jealousy. A few\nmonths later, however, du Tillet went to see Birotteau and asked his\nendorsement for twenty thousand francs, to enable him to make up the\nsecurities he needed in an enterprise which was to put him on the\nhigh-road to fortune. Observing the surprise which Cesar showed at this\nimpudence, du Tillet frowned, and asked if he had no confidence in\nhim. Matifat and two other merchants, who were present on business with\nBirotteau, also observed the indignation of the perfumer, who repressed\nhis anger in their presence. Du Tillet, he thought, might have become\nan honest man; his previous fault might have been committed for some\nmistress in distress or from losses at cards; the public reprobation of\nan honest man might drive one still young, and possibly repentant,\ninto a career of crime. So this angel took up his pen and endorsed du\nTillet's notes, telling him that he was heartily willing thus to oblige\na lad who had been very useful to him. The blood rushed to his face as\nhe uttered the falsehood. Du Tillet could not meet his eye, and no doubt\nvowed to him at that moment the undying hatred which the spirits of\ndarkness feel towards the angels of light.\n\nFrom this time du Tillet held his balance-pole so well as he danced the\ntight-rope of financial speculation, that he was rich and elegant in\nappearance before he became so in reality. As soon as he got hold of\na cabriolet he was always in it; he kept himself in the high sphere\nof those who mingle business with pleasure, and make the foyer of the\nopera-house a branch of the Bourse,--in short, the Turcarets of the\nperiod. Thanks to Madame Roguin, whom he had known at the Birotteau's,\nhe was received at once among people of the highest standing in finance;\nand, at the moment of which we write, he had reached a prosperity in\nwhich there was nothing fictitious. He was on the best terms with\nthe house of Nucingen, to which Roguin had introduced him, and he had\npromptly become connected with the brothers Keller and with several\nother great banking-houses. No one knew from whence this youth had\nderived the immense capital which he handled, but every one attributed\nhis success to his intelligence and his integrity.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThe Restoration made Cesar a personage, and the turmoil of political\ncrises naturally lessened his recollection of these domestic\nmisadventures. The constancy of his royalist opinions (to which he\nhad become exceedingly indifferent since his wound, though he remained\nfaithful to them out of decency) and the memory of his devotion in\nVendemiaire won him very high patronage, precisely because he had asked\nfor none. He was appointed major in the National Guard, although he\nwas utterly incapable of giving the word of command. In 1815 Napoleon,\nalways his enemy, dismissed him. During the Hundred Days Birotteau was\nthe bugbear of the liberals of his quarter; for it was not until 1815\nthat differences of political opinion grew up among merchants, who had\nhitherto been unanimous in their desires for public tranquillity, of\nwhich, as they knew, business affairs stood much in need.\n\nAt the second Restoration the royal government was obliged to remodel\nthe municipality of Paris. The prefect wished to nominate Birotteau as\nmayor. Thanks to his wife, the perfumer would only accept the place of\ndeputy-mayor, which brought him less before the public. Such modesty\nincreased the respect generally felt for him, and won him the friendship\nof the new mayor, Monsieur Flamet de la Billardiere. Birotteau, who\nhad seen him in the shop in the days when \"The Queen of Roses\" was the\nheadquarters of royalist conspiracy, mentioned him to the prefect of\nthe Seine when that official consulted Cesar on the choice to be made.\nMonsieur and Madame Birotteau were therefore never forgotten in the\ninvitations of the mayor. Madame Birotteau frequently took up the\ncollections at Saint-Roch in the best of good company. La Billardiere\nwarmly supported Birotteau when the question of bestowing the crosses\ngiven to the municipality came up, and dwelt upon his wound at\nSaint-Roch, his attachment to the Bourbons, and the respect which he\nenjoyed. The government, wishing on the one hand to cheapen Napoleon's\norder by lavishing the cross of the Legion of honor, and on the other\nto win adherents and rally to the Bourbons the various trades and men\nof arts and sciences, included Birotteau in the coming promotion.\nThis honor, which suited well with the show that Cesar made in\nhis arrondissement, put him in a position where the ideas of a man\naccustomed to succeed naturally enlarged themselves. The news which the\nmayor had just given him of his preferment was the determining reason\nthat decided him to plunge into the scheme which he now for the first\ntime revealed to his wife; he believed it would enable him to give up\nperfumery all the more quickly, and rise into the regions of the higher\nbourgeoisie of Paris.\n\nCesar was now forty years old. The work he had undertaken in his\nmanufactories had given him a few premature wrinkles, and had slightly\nsilvered the thick tufts of hair on which the pressure of his hat left a\nshining circle. His forehead, where the hair grew in a way to mark five\ndistinct points, showed the simplicity of his life. The heavy eyebrows\nwere not alarming because the limpid glance of his frank blue eyes\nharmonized with the open forehead of an honest man. His nose, broken at\nthe bridge and thick at the end, gave him the wondering look of a gaby\nin the streets of Paris. His lips were very thick, and his large chin\nfell in a straight line below them. His face, high-colored and square\nin outline, revealed, by the lines of its wrinkles and by the general\ncharacter of its expression, the ingenuous craftiness of a peasant. The\nstrength of his body, the stoutness of his limbs, the squareness of his\nshoulders, the width of his feet,--all denoted the villager transplanted\nto Paris. His powerful hairy hands, with their large square nails, would\nalone have attested his origin if other vestiges had not remained in\nvarious parts of his person. His lips wore the cordial smile which\nshopkeepers put on when a customer enters; but this commercial sunshine\nwas really the image of his inward content, and pictured the state\nof his kindly soul. His distrust never went beyond the lines of his\nbusiness, his craftiness left him on the steps of the Bourse, or when he\nclosed the pages of his ledger. Suspicion was to him very much what\nhis printed bill-heads were,--a necessity of the sale itself. His\ncountenance presented a sort of comical assurance and conceit mingled\nwith good nature, which gave it originality and saved it from too close\na resemblance to the insipid face of a Parisian bourgeois. Without this\nair of naive self-admiration and faith in his own person, he would have\nwon too much respect; he drew nearer to his fellows by thus contributing\nhis quota of absurdity. When speaking, he habitually crossed his hands\nbehind his back. When he thought he had said something striking or\ngallant, he rose imperceptibly on the points of his toes twice, and\ndropped back heavily on his heels, as if to emphasize what he said. In\nthe midst of an argument he might be seen turning round upon himself and\nwalking off a few steps, as if he had gone to find objections with which\nhe returned upon his adversary brusquely. He never interrupted, and was\nsometimes a victim to this careful observance of civility; for others\nwould take the words out of his mouth, and the good man had to yield\nhis ground without opening his lips. His great experience in commercial\nmatters had given him a few fixed habits, which some people called\neccentricities. If a note were overdue he sent for the bailiff, and\nthought only of recovering capital, interest, and costs; and the bailiff\nwas ordered to pursue the matter until the debtor went into bankruptcy.\nCesar then stopped all proceedings, never appeared at any meeting of\ncreditors, and held on to his securities. He adopted this system and his\nimplacable contempt for bankrupts from Monsieur Ragon, who in the course\nof his commercial life had seen such loss of time in litigation that\nhe had come to look upon the meagre and uncertain dividends obtained by\nsuch compromises as fully counterbalanced by a better employment of the\ntime spent in coming and going, in making proposals, or in listening to\nexcuses for dishonesty.\n\n\"If the bankrupt is an honest man, and recovers himself, he will pay\nyou,\" Ragon would say. \"If he is without means and simply unfortunate,\nwhy torment him? If he is a scoundrel, you will never get anything. Your\nknown severity will make you seem uncompromising; it will be impossible\nto negotiate with you; consequently you are the one who will get paid as\nlong as there is anything to pay with.\"\n\nCesar came to all appointments at the expected hour; but if he were kept\nwaiting, he left ten minutes later with an inflexibility which nothing\never changed. Thus his punctuality compelled all persons who had\ndealings with him to be punctual themselves.\n\nThe dress adopted by the worthy man was in keeping with his manners and\nhis countenance. No power could have made him give up the white muslin\ncravats, with ends embroidered by his wife or daughter, which hung down\nbeneath his chin. His waistcoat of white pique, squarely buttoned, came\ndown low over his stomach, which was rather protuberant, for he was\nsomewhat fat. He wore blue trousers, black silk stockings, and shoes\nwith ribbon ties, which were often unfastened. His surtout coat,\nolive-green and always too large, and his broad-brimmed hat gave him the\nair of a Quaker. When he dressed for the Sunday evening festivities he\nput on silk breeches, shoes with gold buckles, and the inevitable square\nwaistcoat, whose front edges opened sufficiently to show a pleated\nshirt-frill. His coat, of maroon cloth, had wide flaps and long skirts.\nUp to the year 1819 he kept up the habit of wearing two watch-chains,\nwhich hung down in parallel lines; but he only put on the second when he\ndressed for the evening.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nSuch was Cesar Birotteau; a worthy man, to whom the fates presiding at\nthe birth of men had denied the faculty of judging politics and life\nin their entirety, and of rising above the social level of the middle\nclasses; who followed ignorantly the track of routine, whose opinions\nwere all imposed upon him from the outside and applied by him without\nexamination. Blind but good, not spiritual but deeply religious, he had\na pure heart. In that heart there shone one love, the light and strength\nof his life; for his desire to rise in life, and the limited knowledge\nhe had gained of the world, both came from his affection for his wife\nand for his daughter.\n\nAs for Madame Cesar, then thirty-seven years old, she bore so close a\nresemblance to the Venus of Milo that all who knew her recognized the\nlikeness when the Duc de Riviere sent the beautiful statue to Paris.\nIn a few months sorrows were to dim with yellowing tints that dazzling\nfairness, to hollow and blacken the bluish circle round the lovely\ngreenish-gray eyes so cruelly that she then wore the look of an old\nMadonna; for amid the coming ruin she retained her gentle sincerity,\nher pure though saddened glance; and no one ever thought her less than a\nbeautiful woman, whose bearing was virtuous and full of dignity. At the\nball now planned by Cesar she was to shine with a last lustre of beauty,\nremarked upon at the time and long remembered.\n\nEvery life has its climax,--a period when causes are at work, and are in\nexact relation to results. This mid-day of life, when living forces\nfind their equilibrium and put forth their productive powers with full\neffect, is common not only to organized beings but to cities, nations,\nideas, institutions, commerce, and commercial enterprises, all of which,\nlike noble races and dynasties, are born and rise and fall. From whence\ncomes the vigor with which this law of growth and decay applies itself\nto all organized things in this lower world? Death itself, in times\nof scourge, has periods when it advances, slackens, sinks back, and\nslumbers. Our globe is perhaps only a rocket a little more continuing\nthan the rest. History, recording the causes of the rise and fall of all\nthings here below, could enlighten man as to the moment when he might\narrest the play of all his faculties; but neither the conquerors, nor\nthe actors, nor the women, nor the writers in the great drama will\nlisten to the salutary voice.\n\nCesar Birotteau, who might with reason think himself at the apogee of\nhis fortunes, used this crucial pause as the point of a new departure.\nHe did not know, moreover neither nations nor kings have attempted to\nmake known in characters ineffaceable, the cause of the vast overthrows\nwith which history teems, and of which so many royal and commercial\nhouses offer signal examples. Why are there no modern pyramids to recall\nceaselessly the one principle which dominates the common-weal of nations\nand of individual life? _When the effect produced is no longer in direct\nrelation nor in equal proportion to the cause, disorganization has\nbegun._ And yet such monuments stand everywhere; it is tradition and the\nstones of the earth which tell us of the past, which set a seal upon the\ncaprices of indomitable destiny, whose hand wipes out our dreams, and\nshows us that all great events are summed up in one idea. Troy and\nNapoleon are but poems. May this present history be the poem of\nmiddle-class vicissitudes, to which no voice has given utterance because\nthey have seemed poor in dignity, enormous as they are in volume. It is\nnot one man with whom we are now to deal, but a whole people, or world,\nof sorrows.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nCesar's last thought as he fell asleep was a fear that his wife would\nmake peremptory objections in the morning, and he ordered himself to\nget up very early and escape them. At the dawn of day he slipped out\nnoiselessly, leaving his wife in bed, dressed quickly, and went down\nto the shop, just as the boy was taking down the numbered shutters.\nBirotteau, finding himself alone, the clerks not having appeared, went\nto the doorway to see how the boy, named Raguet, did his work,--for\nBirotteau knew all about it from experience. In spite of the sharp air\nthe weather was beautiful.\n\n\"Popinot, get your hat, put on your shoes, and call Monsieur Celestin;\nyou and I will go and have a talk in the Tuileries,\" he said, when he\nsaw Anselme come down.\n\nPopinot, the admirable antipodes of du Tillet, apprenticed to Cesar by\none of those lucky chances which lead us to believe in a Sub-Providence,\nplays so great a part in this history that it becomes absolutely\nnecessary to sketch his profile here. Madame Ragon was a Popinot. She\nhad two brothers. One, the youngest of the family, was at this time a\njudge in the Lower courts of the Seine,--courts which take cognizance\nof all civil contests involving sums above a certain amount. The eldest,\nwho was in the wholesale wool-trade, lost his property and died, leaving\nto the care of Madame Ragon and his brother an only son, who had lost\nhis mother at his birth. To give him a trade, Madame Ragon placed\nher nephew at \"The Queen of Roses,\" hoping he might some day succeed\nBirotteau. Anselme Popinot was a little fellow and club-footed,--an\ninfirmity bestowed by fate on Lord Byron, Walter Scott, and Monsieur de\nTalleyrand, that others so afflicted might suffer no discouragement. He\nhad the brilliant skin, with frequent blotches, which belongs to persons\nwith red hair; but his clear brow, his eyes the color of a grey-veined\nagate, his pleasant mouth, his fair complexion, the charm of his modest\nyouth and the shyness which grew out of his deformity, all inspired\nfeelings of protection in those who knew him: we love the weak, and\nPopinot was loved. Little Popinot--everybody called him so--belonged\nto a family essentially religious, whose virtues were intelligent, and\nwhose lives were simple and full of noble actions. The lad himself,\nbrought up by his uncle the judge, presented a union of qualities which\nare the beauty of youth; good and affectionate, a little shame-faced\nthough full of eagerness, gentle as a lamb but energetic in his work,\ndevoted and sober, he was endowed with the virtues of a Christian in the\nearly ages of the Church.\n\nWhen he heard of a walk in the Tuileries,--certainly the most eccentric\nproposal that his august master could have made to him at that hour of\nthe day,--Popinot felt sure that he must intend to speak to him about\nsetting up in business. He thought suddenly of Cesarine, the true queen\nof roses, the living sign of the house, whom he had loved from the day\nwhen he was taken into Birotteau's employ, two months before the advent\nof du Tillet. As he went upstairs he was forced to pause; his heart\nswelled, his arteries throbbed violently. However, he soon came down\nagain, followed by Celestin, the head-clerk. Anselme and his master\nturned without a word in the direction of the Tuileries.\n\nPopinot was twenty-one years old. Birotteau himself had married at\nthat age. Anselme therefore could see no hindrance to his marriage\nwith Cesarine, though the wealth of the perfumer and the beauty of the\ndaughter were immense obstacles in the path of his ambitious desires:\nbut love gets onward by leaps of hope, and the more absurd they are\nthe greater faith it has in them; the farther off was the mistress of\nAnselme's heart, the more ardent became his desires. Happy the youth\nwho in those levelling days when all hats looked alike, had contrived\nto create a sense of distance between the daughter of a perfumer and\nhimself, the scion of an old Parisian family! In spite of all his doubts\nand fears he was happy; did he not dine every day beside Cesarine? So,\nwhile attending to the business of the house, he threw a zeal and energy\ninto his work which deprived it of all hardship; doing it for the sake\nof Cesarine, nothing tired him. Love, in a youth of twenty, feeds on\ndevotion.\n\n\"He is a true merchant; he will succeed,\" Cesar would say to Madame\nRagon, as he praised Anselme's activity in preparing the work at the\nfactory, or boasted of his readiness in learning the niceties of the\ntrade, or recalled his arduous labors when shipments had to be made, and\nwhen, with his sleeves rolled up and his arms bare, the lame lad packed\nand nailed up, himself alone, more cases than all the other clerks put\ntogether.\n\nThe well-known and avowed intentions of Alexandre Crottat, head-clerk\nto Roguin, and the wealth of his father, a rich farmer of Brie, were\ncertainly obstacles in the lad's way; but even these were not the\nhardest to conquer. Popinot buried in the depths of his heart a sad\nsecret, which widened the distance between Cesarine and himself. The\nproperty of the Ragons, on which he might have counted, was involved,\nand the orphan lad had the satisfaction of enabling them to live by\nmaking over to them his meagre salary. Yet with all these drawbacks\nhe believed in success! He had sometimes caught a glance of dignified\napproval from Cesarine; in the depths of her blue eyes he had dared\nto read a secret thought full of caressing hopes. He now walked beside\nCesar, heaving with these ideas, trembling, silent, agitated, as any\nyoung lad might well have been by such an occurrence in the burgeoning\ntime of youth.\n\n\"Popinot,\" said the worthy man, \"is your aunt well?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"She has seemed rather anxious lately. Does anything trouble her?\nListen, my boy; you must not be too reticent with me. I am half one of\nthe family. I have known your uncle Ragon thirty-five years. I went to\nhim in hob-nailed shoes, just as I came from my village. That place is\ncalled Les Tresorieres, but I can tell you that all my worldly goods\nwere one louis, given me by my godmother the late Marquise d'Uxelles,\na relation of Monsieur le Duc and Madame la Duchesse de Lenoncourt, who\nare now customers of ours. I pray every Sunday for her and for all her\nfamily; I send yearly to her niece in Touraine, Madame de Mortsauf,\nall her perfumery. I get a good deal of custom through them; there's\nMonsieur de Vandenesse who spends twelve hundred francs a year with\nus. If I were not grateful out of good feeling, I ought to be so out of\npolicy; but as for you Anselme, I wish you well for you own sake, and\nwithout any other thought.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur! if you will allow me to say so, you have got a head of\ngold.\"\n\n\"No, no, my boy, that's not it. I don't say that my head-piece isn't as\ngood as another's; but the thing is, I've been honest,--_tenaciously_!\nI've kept to good conduct; I never loved any woman except my wife.\nLove is a famous _vehicle_,--happy word used by Monsieur Villele in the\ntribune yesterday.\"\n\n\"Love!\" exclaimed Popinot. \"Oh, monsieur! can it be--\"\n\n\"Bless me! there's Pere Roguin, on foot at this hour, at the top of\nthe Place Louis XV. I wonder what he is doing there!\" thought Cesar,\nforgetting all about Anselme and the oil of nuts.\n\nThe suspicions of his wife came back to his mind; and instead of turning\nin to the Tuileries Gardens, Birotteau walked on to meet the notary.\nAnselme followed his master at a distance, without being able to define\nthe reason why he suddenly felt an interest in a matter so apparently\nunimportant, and full of joy at the encouragement he derived from\nCesar's mention of the hob-nailed shoes, the one louis, and love.\n\nIn times gone by, Roguin--a large stout man, with a pimpled face, a very\nbald forehead, and black hair--had not been wanting in a certain\nforce of character and countenance. He had once been young and daring;\nbeginning as a mere clerk, he had risen to be a notary; but at this\nperiod his face showed, to the eyes of an observer, certain haggard\nlines, and an expression of weariness in the pursuit of pleasure. When\na man plunges into the mire of excesses it is seldom that his face shows\nno trace of it. In the present instance the lines of the wrinkles and\nthe heat of the complexion were markedly ignoble. Instead of the pure\nglow which suffuses the tissues of a virtuous man and stamps them, as\nit were, with the flower of health, the impurities of his blood could\nbe seen to master the soundness of his body. His nose was ignominiously\nshortened like those of men in whom scrofulous humors, attacking that\norgan, produce a secret infirmity which a virtuous queen of France\ninnocently believed to be a misfortune common to the whole human race,\nfor she had never approached any man but the king sufficiently near to\nbecome aware of her blunder. Roguin hoped to conceal this misfortune by\nthe excessive use of snuff, but he only increased the trouble which was\nthe principal cause of his disasters.\n\nIs it not a too-prolonged social flattery to paint men forever under\nfalse colors, and never to reveal the actual causes which underlie their\nvicissitudes, caused as they so often are by maladies? Physical evil,\nconsidered under the aspect of its moral ravages, examined as to\nits influence upon the mechanism of life, has been perhaps too much\nneglected by the historians of the social kingdom. Madame Cesar had\nguessed the secret of Roguin's household.\n\nFrom the night of her marriage, the charming and only daughter of\nthe banker Chevrel conceived for the unhappy notary an insurmountable\nantipathy, and wished to apply at once for a divorce. But Roguin, happy\nin obtaining a rich wife with five hundred thousand francs of her own,\nto say nothing of expectations, entreated her not to institute an\naction for divorce, promising to leave her free, and to accept all the\nconsequences of such an agreement. Madame Roguin thus became sovereign\nmistress of the situation, and treated her husband as a courtesan treats\nan elderly lover. Roguin soon found his wife too expensive, and like\nother Parisian husbands he set up a private establishment of his own,\nkeeping the cost, in the first instance, within the limits of moderate\nexpenditure. In the beginning he encountered, at no great expense,\ngrisettes who were glad of his protection; but for the past three\nyears he had fallen a prey to one of those unconquerable passions which\nsometimes invade the whole being of a man between fifty and sixty years\nof age. It was roused by a magnificent creature known as _la belle\nHollandaise_ in the annals of prostitution, for into that gulf she was\nto fall back and become a noted personage through her death. She was\noriginally brought from Bruges by a client of Roguin, who soon after\nleft Paris in consequence of political events, presenting her to the\nnotary in 1815. Roguin bought a house for her in the Champs-Elysees,\nfurnished it handsomely, and in trying to satisfy her costly caprices\nhad gradually eaten up his whole fortune.\n\nThe gloomy look on the notary's face, which he hastened to lay aside\nwhen he saw Birotteau, grew out of certain mysterious circumstances\nwhich were at the bottom of the secret fortune so rapidly acquired by du\nTillet. The scheme originally planned by that adventurer had changed\non the first Sunday when he saw, at Birotteau's house, the relations\nexisting between Monsieur and Madame Roguin. He had come there not so\nmuch to seduce Madame Cesar as to obtain the offer of her daughter's\nhand by way of compensation for frustrated hopes, and he found little\ndifficulty in renouncing his purpose when he discovered that Cesar, whom\nhe supposed to be rich, was in point of fact comparatively poor. He set\na watch on the notary, wormed himself into his confidence, was presented\nto la belle Hollandaise, made a study of their relation to each other,\nand soon found that she threatened to renounce her lover if he limited\nher luxuries. La belle Hollandaise was one of those mad-cap women who\ncare nothing as to where the money comes from, or how it is obtained,\nand who are capable of giving a ball with the gold obtained by a\nparricide. She never thought of the morrow; for her the future was after\ndinner, and the end of the month eternity, even if she had bills to pay.\nDu Tillet, delighted to have found such a lever, exacted from la belle\nHollandaise a promise that she would love Roguin for thirty thousand\nfrancs a year instead of fifty thousand,--a service which infatuated old\nmen seldom forget.\n\nOne evening, after a supper where the wine flowed freely, Roguin\nunbosomed himself to du Tillet on the subject of his financial\ndifficulties. His own estate was tied up and legally settled on his\nwife, and he had been led by his fatal passion to take from the funds\nentrusted to him by his clients a sum which was already more than half\ntheir amount. When the whole were gone, the unfortunate man intended to\nblow out his brains, hoping to mitigate the disgrace of his conduct by\nmaking a demand upon public pity. A fortune, rapid and secure, darted\nbefore du Tillet's eyes like a flash of lightning in a saturnalian\nnight. He promptly reassured Roguin, and made him fire his pistols into\nthe air.\n\n\"With such risks as yours,\" he said, \"a man of your calibre should not\nbehave like a fool and walk on tiptoe, but speculate--boldly.\"\n\nHe advised Roguin to take a large sum from the remaining trust-moneys\nand give it to him, du Tillet, with permission to stake it bravely on\nsome large operation, either at the Bourse, or in one of the thousand\nenterprises of private speculation then about to be launched. Should he\nwin, they were to form a banking-house, where they could turn to good\naccount a portion of the deposits, while the profits could be used by\nRoguin for his pleasures. If luck went against them, Roguin was to get\naway and live in foreign countries, and trust to _his friend_ du Tillet,\nwho would be faithful to him to the last sou. It was a rope thrown to a\ndrowning man, and Roguin did not perceive that the perfumer's clerk had\nflung it round his neck.\n\nMaster of Roguin's secret, du Tillet made use of it to establish his\npower over wife, mistress, and husband. Madame Roguin, when told of a\ndisaster she was far from suspecting, accepted du Tillet's attentions,\nwho about this time left his situation with Birotteau, confident of\nfuture success. He found no difficulty in persuading the mistress to\nrisk a certain sum of money as a provision against the necessity of\nresorting to prostitution if misfortunes overtook her. The wife, on the\nother hand, regulated her accounts, and gathered together quite a little\ncapital, which she gave to the man whom her husband confided in; for\nby this time the notary had given a hundred thousand francs of the\nremaining trust-money to his accomplice. Du Tillet's relations to Madame\nRoguin then became such that her interest in him was transformed\ninto affection and finally into a violent passion. Through his three\nsleeping-partners Ferdinand naturally derived a profit; but not content\nwith that profit, he had the audacity, when gambling at the Bourse in\ntheir name, to make an agreement with a pretended adversary, a man of\nstraw, from whom he received back for himself certain sums which he\nhad charged as losses to his clients. As soon as he had gained fifty\nthousand francs he was sure of fortune. He had the eye of an eagle to\ndiscern the phases through which France was then passing. He played low\nduring the campaign of the allied armies, and high on the restoration of\nthe Bourbons. Two months after the return of Louis XVIII., Madame Roguin\nwas worth two hundred thousand francs, du Tillet three hundred thousand,\nand the notary had been able to get his accounts once more into order.\n\nLa belle Hollandaise wasted her share of the profits; for she was\nsecretly a prey to an infamous scoundrel named Maxime de Trailles, a\nformer page of the Emperor. Du Tillet discovered the real name of\nthis woman in drawing out a deed. She was Sarah Gobseck. Struck by the\ncoincidence of the name with that of a well-known usurer, he went to the\nold money-lender (that providence of young men of family) to find out\nhow far he would back the credit of his relation. The Brutus of usurers\nwas implacable towards his great-niece, but du Tillet himself pleased\nhim by posing as Sarah's banker, and having funds to invest. The Norman\nnature and the rapacious nature suited each other. Gobseck happened to\nwant a clever young man to examine into an affair in a foreign country.\nIt chanced that an auditor of the Council of State, overtaken by the\nreturn of the Bourbons and anxious to stand well at court, had gone to\nGermany and bought up all the debts contracted by the princes during the\nemigration. He now offered the profits of the affair, which to him was\nmerely political, to any one who would reimburse him. Gobseck would pay\nno money down, unless in proportion to the redemption of the debts, and\ninsisted on a careful examination of the affair. Usurers never trust any\none; they demand vouchers. With them the bird in the hand is everything;\nicy when they have no need of a man, they are wheedling and inclined to\nbe gracious when they can make him useful.\n\nDu Tillet knew the enormous underground part played in the world by\nsuch men as Werbrust and Gigonnet, commercial money-lenders in the\nRues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin; by Palma, banker in the Faubourg\nPoissonniere,--all of whom were closely connected with Gobseck. He\naccordingly offered a cash security, and obtained an interest in the\naffair, on condition that these gentlemen would use in their commercial\nloans certain moneys he should place in their hands. By this means he\nstrengthened himself with a solid support on all sides.\n\nDu Tillet accompanied Monsieur Clement Chardin des Lupeaulx to Germany\nduring the Hundred Days, and came back at the second Restoration, having\ndone more to increase his means of making a fortune than augmented\nthe fortune itself. He was now in the secret councils of the sharpest\nspeculators in Paris; he had secured the friendship of the man with whom\nhe had examined into the affair of the debts, and that clever juggler\nhad laid bare to him the secrets of legal and political science. Du\nTillet possessed one of those minds which understand at half a word, and\nhe completed his education during his travels in Germany. On his return\nhe found Madame Roguin faithful to him. As to the notary, he longed\nfor Ferdinand with as much impatience as his wife did, for la belle\nHollandaise had once more ruined him. Du Tillet questioned the woman,\nbut could find no outlay equal to the sum dissipated. It was then\nthat he discovered the secret which Sarah had carefully concealed from\nhim,--her mad passion for Maxime de Trailles, whose earliest steps in a\ncareer of vice showed him for what he was, one of those good-for-nothing\nmembers of the body politic who seem the necessary evil of all good\ngovernment, and whose love of gambling renders them insatiable. On\nmaking this discovery, du Tillet at once saw the reason of Gobseck's\ninsensibility to the claims of his niece.\n\nUnder these circumstances du Tillet the banker (for Ferdinand was now\na banker) advised Roguin to lay up something against a rainy day, by\npersuading his clients to invest in some enterprise which might enable\nhim to put by for himself large sums of money, in case he were forced to\ngo into bankruptcy through the affairs of the bank. After many ups and\ndowns, which were profitable to none but Madame Roguin and du Tillet,\nRoguin heard the fatal hour of his insolvency and final ruin strike. His\nmisery was then worked upon by his faithful friend. Ferdinand invented\nthe speculation in lands about the Madeleine. The hundred thousand\nfrancs belonging to Cesar Birotteau, which were in the hands of the\nnotary, were made over to du Tillet; for the latter, whose object was\nto ruin the perfumer, had made Roguin understand that he would run less\nrisk if he got his nearest friends into the net. \"A friend,\" he said,\n\"is more considerate, even if angry.\"\n\nFew people realize to-day how little value the lands about the Madeleine\nhad at the period of which we write; but at that time they were likely\nto be sold even below their then value, because of the difficulty of\nfinding purchasers willing to wait for the profits of the enterprise.\nNow, du Tillet's aim was to seize the profits speedily without the\nlosses of a protracted speculation. In other words, his plan was to\nstrangle the speculation and get hold of it as a dead thing, which he\nmight galvanize back to life when it suited him. In such a scheme the\nGobsecks, Palmas, and Werbrusts would have been ready to lend a hand,\nbut du Tillet was not yet sufficiently intimate with them to ask their\naid; besides, he wanted to hide his own hand in conducting the affair,\nthat he might get the profits of his theft without the shame of it.\nHe felt the necessity of having under his thumb one of those living\nlay-figures called in commercial language a \"man of straw.\" His former\ntool at the Bourse struck him as a suitable person for the post; he\naccordingly trenched upon Divine right, and created a man. Out of a\nformer commercial traveller, who was without means or capacity of any\nkind, except that of talking indefinitely on all subjects and saying\nnothing, who was without a farthing or a chance to make one,--able,\nnevertheless, to understand a part and act it without compromising the\nplay or the actors in it, and possessed of a rare sort of honor, that\nof keeping a secret and letting himself be dishonored to screen his\nemployers,--out of such a being du Tillet now made a banker, who set on\nfoot and directed vast enterprises; the head, namely, of the house of\nClaparon.\n\nThe fate of Charles Claparon would be, if du Tillet's scheme ended\nin bankruptcy, a swift deliverance to the tender mercies of Jews and\nPharisees; and he well knew it. But to a poor devil who was despondently\nroaming the boulevard with a future of forty sous in his pocket when his\nold comrade du Tillet chanced to meet him, the little gains that he\nwas to get out of the affair seemed an Eldorado. His friendship,\nhis devotion, to du Tillet, increased by unreflecting gratitude and\nstimulated by the wants of a libertine and vagabond life, led him to say\n_amen_ to everything. Having sold his honor, he saw it risked with so\nmuch caution that he ended by attaching himself to his old comrade as a\ndog to his master. Claparon was an ugly poodle, but as ready to jump as\nCurtius. In the present affair he was to represent half the purchasers\nof the land, while Cesar Birotteau represented the other half. The notes\nwhich Claparon was to receive from Birotteau were to be discounted by\none of the usurers whose name du Tillet was authorized to use, and this\nwould send Cesar headlong into bankruptcy so soon as Roguin had drawn\nfrom him his last funds. The assignees of the failure would, as du\nTillet felt certain, follow his cue; and he, already possessed of the\nproperty paid over by the perfumer and his associates, could sell the\nlands at auction and buy them in at half their value with the funds of\nRoguin and the assets of the failure. The notary went into this scheme\nbelieving that he should enrich himself by the spoliation of Birotteau\nand his copartners; but the man in whose power he had placed himself\nintended to take, and eventually did take, the lion's share. Roguin,\nunable to sue du Tillet in any of the courts, was glad of the bone flung\nto him, month by month, in the recesses of Switzerland, where he\nfound nymphs at a reduction. Circumstances, actual facts, and not the\nimagination of a tragic author inventing a catastrophe, gave birth to\nthis horrible scheme. Hatred without a thirst for vengeance is like a\nseed falling on stony ground; but vengeance vowed to a Cesar by a du\nTillet is a natural movement of the soul. If it were not, then we\nmust deny the warfare between the angels of light and the spirits of\ndarkness.\n\nDu Tillet could not very easily assassinate the man who knew him to\nbe guilty of a petty theft, but he could fling him into the mire and\nannihilate him so completely that his word and testimony would count\nfor nothing. For a long time revenge had germinated in his heart without\nbudding; for the men who hate most are usually those who have little\ntime in Paris to make plans; life is too fast, too full, too much at\nthe mercy of unexpected events. But such perpetual changes, though they\nhinder premeditation, nevertheless offer opportunity to thoughts lurking\nin the depths of a purpose which is strong enough to lie in wait for\ntheir tidal chances. When Roguin first confided his troubles to du\nTillet, the latter had vaguely foreseen the possibility of destroying\nCesar, and he was not mistaken. Forced at last to give up his mistress,\nthe notary drank the dregs of his philter from a broken chalice. He went\nevery day to the Champs Elysees returning home early in the morning. The\nsuspicions of Madame Cesar were justified.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nFrom the moment when a man consents to play the part which du Tillet had\nallotted to Roguin, he develops the talents of a comedian; he has the\neye of a lynx and the penetration of a seer; he magnetizes his dupe. The\nnotary had seen Birotteau some time before Birotteau had caught sight of\nhim; when the perfumer did see him, Roguin held out his hand before they\nmet.\n\n\"I have just been to make the will of a great personage who has only\neight days to live,\" he said, with an easy manner. \"They have treated me\nlike a country doctor,--fetched me in a carriage, and let me walk home\non foot.\"\n\nThese words chased away the slight shade of suspicion which clouded the\nface of the perfumer, and which Roguin had been quick to perceive. The\nnotary was careful not to be the first to mention the land speculation;\nhis part was to deal the last blow.\n\n\"After wills come marriage contracts,\" said Birotteau. \"Such is life.\nApropos, when do we marry the Madeleine? Hey! hey! papa Roguin,\" he\nadded, tapping the notary on the stomach.\n\nAmong men the most chaste of bourgeois have the ambition to appear\nrakish.\n\n\"Well, if it is not to-day,\" said the notary, with a diplomatic air,\n\"then never. We are afraid that the affair may get wind. I am much urged\nby two of my wealthiest clients, who want a share in this speculation.\nThere it is, to take or leave. This morning I shall draw the deeds. You\nhave till one o'clock to make up your mind. Adieu; I am just on my way\nto read over the rough draft which Xandrot has been making out during\nthe night.\"\n\n\"Well, my mind is made up. I pass my word,\" said Birotteau, running\nafter the notary and seizing his hand. \"Take the hundred thousand francs\nwhich were laid by for my daughter's portion.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Roguin, leaving him.\n\nFor a moment, as Birotteau turned to rejoin little Popinot, he felt a\nfierce heat in his entrails, the muscles of his stomach contracted, his\nears buzzed.\n\n\"What is the matter, monsieur?\" asked the clerk, when he saw his\nmaster's pale face.\n\n\"Ah, my lad! I have just with one word decided on a great undertaking;\nno man is master of himself at such a moment. You are a party to it. In\nfact, I brought you here that we might talk of it at our ease; no one\ncan overhear us. Your aunt is in trouble; how did she lose her money?\nTell me.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, my uncle and aunt put all their property into the hands of\nMonsieur de Nucingen, and they were forced to accept as security certain\nshares in the mines at Wortschin, which as yet pay no dividends; and it\nis hard at their age to live on hope.\"\n\n\"How do they live, then?\"\n\n\"They do me the great pleasure of accepting my salary.\"\n\n\"Right, right, Anselme!\" said the perfumer, as a tear rolled down his\ncheek. \"You are worthy of the regard I feel for you. You are about to\nreceive a great recompense for your fidelity to my interests.\"\n\nAs he said these words the worthy man swelled in his own eyes as much\nas he did in those of Popinot, and he uttered them with a plebeian\nand naive emphasis which was the genuine expression of his counterfeit\nsuperiority.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur! have you guessed my love for--\"\n\n\"For whom?\" asked his master.\n\n\"For Mademoiselle Cesarine.\"\n\n\"Ah, boy, you are bold indeed!\" exclaimed Birotteau. \"Keep your secret.\nI promise to forget it. You leave my house to-morrow. I am not angry\nwith you; in your place--the devil! the devil!--I should have done the\nsame. She is so lovely!\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\" said the clerk, who felt his shirt getting wet with\nperspiration.\n\n\"My boy, this matter is not one to be settled in a day. Cesarine is her\nown mistress, and her mother has fixed ideas. Control yourself, wipe\nyour eyes, hold your heart in hand, and don't let us talk any more about\nit. I should not blush to have you for my son-in-law. The nephew of\nMonsieur Popinot, a judge of the civil courts, nephew of the Ragons, you\nhave the right to make your way as well as anybody; but there are _buts_\nand _ifs_ and _hows_ and _whys_. What a devil of a dog you have let\nloose upon me, in the midst of a business conversation! Here, sit down\non that chair, and let the lover give place to the clerk. Popinot, are\nyou a loyal man?\" he said, looking fixedly at the youth. \"Do you feel\nwithin you the nerve to struggle with something stronger than yourself,\nand fight hand to hand?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"To maintain a long and dangerous battle?\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To destroy Macassar Oil!\" said Birotteau, rising on his toes like\na hero in Plutarch. \"Let us not mistake; the enemy is strong, well\nentrenched, formidable! Macassar Oil has been vigorously launched. The\nconception was strong. The square bottles were original; I have thought\nof making ours triangular. Yet on the whole I prefer, after ripe\nreflection, smaller bottles of thin glass, encased in wicker; they would\nhave a mysterious look, and customers like things which puzzle them.\"\n\n\"They would be expensive,\" said Popinot. \"We must get things out as\ncheap as we can, so as to make a good reduction at wholesale.\"\n\n\"Good, my lad! That's the right principle. But now, think of it.\nMacassar Oil will defend itself; it is specious; the name is seductive.\nIt is offered as a foreign importation; and we have the ill-luck to\nbelong to our own country. Come, Popinot, have you the courage to kill\nMacassar? Then begin the fight in foreign lands. It seems that Macassar\nis really in the Indies. Now, isn't it much better to supply a French\nproduct to the Indians than to send them back what they are supposed\nto send to us? Make the venture. Begin the fight in India, in foreign\ncountries, in the departments. Macassar Oil has been thoroughly\nadvertised; we must not underrate its power, it has been pushed\neverywhere, the public knows it.\"\n\n\"I'll kill it!\" cried Popinot, with fire in his eyes.\n\n\"What with?\" said Birotteau. \"That's the way with ardent young people.\nListen till I've done.\"\n\nAnselme fell into position like a soldier presenting arms to a marshal\nof France.\n\n\"Popinot, I have invented an oil to stimulate the growth of hair, to\ntitillate the scalp, to revive the color of male and female tresses.\nThis cosmetic will not be less successful than my Paste or my Lotion.\nBut I don't intend to work it myself. I think of retiring from business.\nIt is you, my boy, who are to launch my Oil Comagene,--from the latin\nword _coma_, which signifies 'hair,' as Monsieur Alibert, the King's\nphysician, says. The word is found in the tragedy of Berenice, where\nRacine introduces a king of Comagene, lover of the queen so celebrated\nfor the beauty of her hair; the king--no doubt as a delicate\nflattery--gave the name to his country. What wit and intellect there is\nin genius! it condescends to the minutest details.\"\n\nLittle Popinot kept his countenance as he listened to this absurd\nflourish, evidently said for his benefit as an educated young man.\n\n\"Anselme, I have cast my eyes upon you as the one to found a commercial\nhouse in the high-class druggist line, Rue des Lombards. I will be\nyour secret partner, and supply the funds to start with. After the\nOil Comagene, we will try an essence of vanilla and the spirit of\npeppermint. We'll tackle the drug-trade by revolutionizing it, by\nselling its products concentrated instead of selling them raw. Ambitious\nyoung man, are you satisfied?\"\n\nAnselme could not answer, his heart was full; but his eyes, filled\nwith tears, answered for him. The offer seemed prompted by indulgent\nfatherhood, saying to him: \"Deserve Cesarine by becoming rich and\nrespected.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he answered at last, \"I will succeed!\"\n\n\"That's what I said at your age,\" cried the perfumer; \"that was my\nmotto. If you don't win my daughter, at least you will win your fortune.\nEh, boy! what is it?\"\n\n\"Let me hope that in acquiring the one I may obtain the other.\"\n\n\"I can't prevent you from hoping, my friend,\" said Birotteau, touched by\nAnselme's tone.\n\n\"Well, then, monsieur, can I begin to-day to look for a shop, so as to\nstart at once?\"\n\n\"Yes, my son. To-morrow we will shut ourselves up in the workshop, you\nand I. Before you go to the Rue des Lombards, call at Livingston's\nand see if my hydraulic press will be ready to use to-morrow morning.\nTo-night we will go, about dinner-time, to the good and illustrious\nMonsieur Vauquelin and consult him. He has lately been employed in\nstudying the composition of hair; he has discovered the nature of the\ncoloring matter and whence it comes; also the structure of the hair\nitself. The secret is just there, Popinot, and you shall know it; all\nwe have to do is to work it out cleverly. Before you go to Livingston's,\njust stop at Pieri Berard's. My lad, the disinterested kindness of\nMonsieur Vauquelin is one of the sorrows of my life. I cannot make him\naccept any return. Happily, I found out from Chiffreville that he wished\nfor the Dresden Madonna, engraved by a man named Muller. After two years\ncorrespondence with Germany, Berard has at last found one on Chinese\npaper before lettering. It cost fifteen hundred francs, my boy. To-day,\nmy benefactor will see it in his antechamber when he bows us out; it is\nto be all framed, and I want you to see about it. We--that is, my wife\nand I--shall thus recall ourselves to his mind; as for gratitude, we\nhave prayed to God for him daily for sixteen years. I can never forget\nhim; but you see, Popinot, men buried in the depths of science do forget\neverything,--wives, friends, and those they have benefited. As for us\nplain people, our lack of mind keeps our hearts warm at any rate. That's\nthe consolation for not being a great man. Look at those gentlemen of\nthe Institute,--all brain; you will never meet one of them in a church.\nMonsieur Vauquelin is tied to his study or his laboratory; but I like\nto believe he thinks of God in analyzing the works of His hands.--Now,\nthen, it is understood; I give you the money and put you in possession\nof my secret; we will go shares, and there's no need for any papers\nbetween us. Hurrah for success! we'll act in concert. Off with you, my\nboy! As for me, I've got my part to attend to. One minute, Popinot. I\ngive a great ball three weeks hence; get yourself a dress-coat, and look\nlike a merchant already launched.\"\n\nThis last kindness touched Popinot so deeply that he caught Cesar's\nbig hand and kissed it; the worthy soul had flattered the lover by this\nconfidence, and people in love are capable of anything.\n\n\"Poor boy!\" thought Birotteau, as he watched him hurrying across the\nTuileries. \"Suppose Cesarine should love him? But he is lame, and his\nhair is the color of a warming-pan. Young girls are queer; still, I\ndon't think that Cesarine--And then her mother wants to see her the\nwife of a notary. Alexandre Crottat can make her rich; wealth makes\neverything bearable, and there is no happiness that won't give way\nunder poverty. However, I am resolved to leave my daughter mistress of\nherself, even if it seems a folly.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nBirotteau's neighbor was a small dealer in umbrellas, parasols, and\ncanes, named Cayron,--a man from Languedoc, doing a poor business, whom\nCesar had several times befriended. Cayron wished nothing better than to\nconfine himself to the ground-floor and let the rich perfumer take the\nfloor above it, thus diminishing his rent.\n\n\"Well, neighbor,\" said Birotteau familiarly, as he entered the man's\nshop, \"my wife consents to the enlargement of our premises. If you like,\nwe will go and see Monsieur Molineux at eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Birotteau,\" said the umbrella-man, \"I have not asked\nyou any compensation for this cession; but you are aware that a good\nmerchant ought to make money out of everything.\"\n\n\"What the devil!\" cried Birotteau. \"I'm not made of money. I don't\nknow that my architect can do the thing at all. He told me that before\nconcluding my arrangements I must know whether the floors were on the\nsame level. Then, supposing Monsieur Molineux does allow me to cut\na door in the wall, is it a party-wall? Moreover, I have to turn my\nstaircase, and make a new landing, so as to get a passage-way on the\nsame floor. All that costs money, and I don't want to ruin myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur,\" said the southerner. \"Before you are ruined, the sun\nwill have married the earth and they'll have had children.\"\n\nBirotteau stroked his chin, rose on the points of his toes, and fell\nback upon his heels.\n\n\"Besides,\" resumed Cayron, \"all I ask you to do is to cash these\nsecurities for me--\"\n\nAnd he held out sixteen notes amounting in all to five thousand francs.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the perfumer turning them over. \"Small fry, two months, three\nmonths--\"\n\n\"Take them as low as six per cent,\" said the umbrella-man humbly.\n\n\"Am I a usurer?\" asked the perfumer reproachfully.\n\n\"What can I do, monsieur? I went to your old clerk, du Tillet, and he\nwould not take them at any price. No doubt he wanted to find out how\nmuch I'd be willing to lose on them.\"\n\n\"I don't know those signatures,\" said the perfumer.\n\n\"We have such queer names in canes and umbrellas; they belong to the\npeddlers.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't say that I will take all; but I'll manage the short\nones.\"\n\n\"For the want of a thousand francs--sure to be repaid in four\nmonths--don't throw me into the hands of the blood-suckers who get the\nbest of our profits; do take all, monsieur! I do so little in the way of\ndiscount that I have no credit; that is what kills us little retailers.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll cash your notes; Celestin will make out the account. Be\nready at eleven, will you? There's my architect, Monsieur Grindot,\" said\nthe perfumer, catching sight of the young man, with whom he had made an\nappointment at Monsieur de la Billardiere's the night before.\n\n\"Contrary to the custom of men of talent you are punctual, monsieur,\"\nsaid Cesar, displaying his finest commercial graces. \"If punctuality,\nin the words of our king,--a man of wit as well as a statesman,--is the\npoliteness of princes, it is also the wealth of merchants. Time, time\nis gold, especially to you artists. I permit myself to say to you that\narchitecture is the union of all the arts. We will not enter through the\nshop,\" he added, opening the private door of his house.\n\nFour years earlier Monsieur Grindot had carried off the _grand prix_ in\narchitecture, and had lately returned from Rome where he had spent three\nyears at the cost of the State. In Italy the young man had dreamed\nof art; in Paris he thought of fortune. Government alone can pay the\nneedful millions to raise an architect to glory; it is therefore natural\nthat every ambitious youth of that calling, returning from Rome\nand thinking himself a Fontaine or a Percier, should bow before the\nadministration. The liberal student became a royalist, and sought to win\nthe favor of influential persons. When a _grand prix_ man behaves thus,\nhis comrades call him a trimmer. The young architect in question had two\nways open to him,--either to serve the perfumer well, or put him under\ncontribution. Birotteau the deputy-mayor, Birotteau the future possessor\nof half the lands about the Madeleine, where he would sooner or later\nbuild up a fine neighborhood, was a man to keep on good terms with.\nGrindot accordingly resolved to sacrifice his immediate gains to his\nfuture interests. He listened patiently to the plans, the repetitions,\nand the ideas of this worthy specimen of the bourgeois class, the\nconstant butt of the witty shafts and ridicule of artists, and the\nobject of their everlasting contempt, nodding his head as if to show the\nperfumer that he caught his ideas. When Cesar had thoroughly explained\neverything, the young man proceeded to sum up for him his own plan.\n\n\"You have now three front windows on the first floor, besides the window\non the staircase which lights the landing; to these four windows you\nmean to add two on the same level in the next house, by turning the\nstaircase, so as to open a way from one house to the other on the street\nside.\"\n\n\"You have understood me perfectly,\" said the perfumer, surprised.\n\n\"To carry out your plan, you must light the new staircase from above,\nand manage to get a porter's lodge beneath it.\"\n\n\"Beneath it?\"\n\n\"Yes, the space over which it rests--\"\n\n\"I understand, monsieur.\"\n\n\"As for your own appartement, give me carte-blanche to arrange and\ndecorate it. I wish to make it worthy--\"\n\n\"Worthy! You have said the word, monsieur.\"\n\n\"How much time do you give me to complete the work?\"\n\n\"Twenty days.\"\n\n\"What sum do you mean to put in the workmen's pockets?\" asked Grindot.\n\n\"How much do you think it will cost?\"\n\n\"An architect can estimate on a new building almost to a farthing,\"\nanswered the young man; \"but as I don't know how to deal with a\nbourgeois--ah! excuse me, monsieur, the word slipped out--I must warn\nyou that it is impossible to calculate the costs of tearing down and\nrebuilding. It will take at least eight days before I can give even\nan approximate idea of them. Trust yourself to me: you shall have a\ncharming staircase, lighted from above, with a pretty vestibule opening\nfrom the street, and in the space under the stairway--\"\n\n\"Must that be used?\"\n\n\"Don't be worried--I will find room for a little porter's lodge. Your\nhouse shall be studied and remodelled _con amore_. Yes, monsieur, I look\nto art and not to fortune. Above all things I do not want fame before I\nhave earned it. To my mind, the best means of winning credit is not to\nplay into the hands of contractors, but to get at good effects cheaply.\"\n\n\"With such ideas, young man,\" said Birotteau in a patronizing tone, \"you\nwill succeed.\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" resumed Grindot, \"employ the masons, painters, locksmiths,\ncarpenters, and upholsterers yourself. I will simply look over their\naccounts. Pay me only two thousand francs commission. It will be money\nwell laid out. Give me the premises to-morrow at twelve o'clock, and\nhave your workmen on the spot.\"\n\n\"How much it will cost, at a rough guess?\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"From ten to twelve thousand francs,\" said Grindot. \"That does not count\nthe furniture; of course you will renew that. Give me the address of\nyour cabinet-maker; I shall have to arrange with him about the choice of\ncolors, so as to have everything in keeping.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Braschon, Rue Saint-Antoine, takes my orders,\" said Birotteau,\nassuming a ducal air.\n\nThe architect wrote down the address in one of those pretty note-books\nwhich invariably come from women.\n\n\"Well,\" said Birotteau, \"I trust to you, monsieur; only you must wait\ntill the lease of the adjoining house is made over to me, and I will get\npermission to cut through the wall.\"\n\n\"Send me a note this evening,\" said the architect; \"it will take me all\nnight to draw the plans--we would rather work for a bourgeois than for\nthe King of Prussia, that is to say for ourselves. I will now take the\ndimensions, the pitch, the size of the widows, the pictures--\"\n\n\"It must be finished on the appointed day,\" said Birotteau. \"If not, no\npay.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said the architect. \"The workmen must do without\nsleep; we will use drying oil in the paint. But don't let yourself be\ntaken in by the contractors; always ask their price in advance, and have\na written agreement.\"\n\n\"Paris is the only place in the world where you can wave a magic wand\nlike that,\" said Birotteau, with an Asiatic gesture worthy of the\nArabian Nights. \"You will do me the honor to come to my ball, monsieur?\nMen of talent are not all disdainful of commerce; and you will meet a\nscientific man of the first order, Monsieur Vauquelin of the Institute;\nalso Monsieur de la Billardiere, Monsieur le comte de Fontaine,\nMonsieur Lebas, judge and president of the Court of commerce, various\nmagistrates, Monsieur le comte de Grandville of the royal suite,\nMonsieur Camusot of the Court of commerce, and Monsieur Cardot, his\nfather-in-law, and, perhaps, Monsieur le duc de Lenoncourt, first\ngentleman of the bed-chamber to the king. I assemble my friends as\nmuch--to celebrate the emancipation of our territory--as to commemorate\nmy--promotion to the order of the Legion of honor,\"--here Grindot made\na curious gesture. \"Possibly I showed myself worthy of that--signal--and\nroyal--favor, by my services on the bench, and by fighting for the\nBourbons upon the steps of Saint-Roch on the 13th Vendemiaire, where I\nwas wounded by Napoleon. These claims--\"\n\nConstance, in a morning gown, here came out of her daughter's bedroom,\nwhere she had been dressing; her first glance cut short Cesar's\neloquence just as he was about to formulate in flowing phrase, though\nmodestly, the tale of his merits.\n\n\"_Tiens, Mimi_, this is Monsieur _de_ Grindot, a young man distinguished\nin his own sphere of life, and the possessor of a great talent. Monsieur\nis the architect recommended to us by Monsieur de la Billardiere to\nsuperintend our _little_ alteration.\"\n\nThe perfumer slipped behind his wife and made a sign to the architect\nto take notice of the word _little_, putting his finger on his lips.\nGrindot took the cue.\n\n\"Will it be very expensive?\" said Constance to the architect.\n\n\"Oh, no, madame; six thousand francs at a rough guess.\"\n\n\"A rough guess!\" exclaimed Madame Birotteau. \"Monsieur, I entreat you,\nbegin nothing without an estimate and the specifications signed. I know\nthe ways of contractors: six thousand francs means twenty thousand.\nWe are not in a position to commit such extravagance. I beg you,\nmonsieur,--though of course my husband is master in his own house,--give\nhim time to reflect.\"\n\n\"Madame, monsieur the deputy-mayor has ordered me to deliver the\npremises, all finished, in twenty days. If we delay, you will be likely\nto incur the expense without obtaining the looked-for result.\"\n\n\"There are expenses and expenses,\" said the handsome mistress of \"The\nQueen of Roses.\"\n\n\"Ah! madame, do you think an architect who seeks to put up public\nbuildings finds it glorious to decorate a mere appartement? I have come\ndown to such details merely to oblige Monsieur de la Billardiere; and if\nyou fear--\"\n\nHere he made a movement to retreat.\n\n\"Well, well, monsieur,\" said Constance re-entering her daughter's room,\nwhere she threw her head on Cesarine's shoulder.\n\n\"Ah, my daughter!\" she cried, \"your father will ruin himself! He has\nengaged an architect with mustachios, who talks about public buildings!\nHe is going to pitch the house out of windows and build us a Louvre.\nCesar is never idle about his follies; he only spoke to me about it in\nthe night, and he begins it in the morning!\"\n\n\"Never mind, mamma; let papa do as he likes. The good God has always\ntaken care of him,\" said Cesarine, kissing her mother and sitting down\nto the piano, to let the architect know that the perfumer's daughter was\nnot ignorant of the fine arts.\n\nWhen Grindot came in to measure the bedroom he was surprised and taken\naback at the beauty of Cesarine. Just out of her dressing-room and\nwearing a pretty morning-gown, fresh and rosy as a young girl is fresh\nand rosy at eighteen, blond and slender, with blue eyes, Cesarine seemed\nto the young artist a picture of the elasticity, so rare in Paris, that\nfills and rounds the delicate cheek, and tints with the color adored of\npainters, the tracery of blue veins throbbing beneath the whiteness\nof her clear skin. Though she lived in the lymphatic atmosphere of a\nParisian shop, where the air stagnates and the sun seldom shines, her\nhabits gave her the same advantages which the open-air life of Rome\ngives to the Transteverine peasant-woman. Her hair,--which was abundant,\nand grew, like that of her father, in points upon her forehead,--was\ncaught up in a twist which showed the lines of a well-set neck, and then\nrippled downward in curls that were scrupulously cared for, after the\nfashion of young shop-women, whose desire to attract attention inspires\nthe truly English minutiae of their toilet. The beauty of this young\ngirl was not the beauty of an English lady, nor of a French duchess,\nbut the round and glowing beauty of a Flemish Rubens. Cesarine had the\nturned-up nose of her father, but it was piquant through the delicacy of\nits modelling,--like those noses, essentially French, which have been\nso well reproduced by Largilliere. Her skin, of a firm full texture,\nbespoke the vitality of a virgin; she had the fine brow of her mother,\nbut it was clear with the serenity of a young girl who knows no care.\nHer liquid blue eyes, bathed in rich fluid, expressed the tender grace\nof a glowing happiness. If that happiness took from her head the poetry\nwhich painters insist on giving to their pictures my making them a shade\ntoo pensive, the vague physical languor of a young girl who has never\nleft her mother's side made up for it, and gave her a species of\nideality. Notwithstanding the graceful lines of her figure, she was\nstrongly built. Her feet betrayed the peasant origin of her father and\nher own defects of race, as did the redness of her hands, the sign of\nthe thoroughly bourgeois life. Sooner or later she would grow stout. She\nhad caught the sentiment of dress from the elegant young women who came\nto the shop, and had learned from them certain movements of the head,\ncertain ways of speaking and of moving; and she could play the well-bred\nwoman in a way that turned the heads of all the young men, especially\nthe clerks, in whose eyes she appeared truly distinguished. Popinot\nswore that he would have no other wife than Cesarine. The liquid\nbrightness of that eye, which a look, or a tone of reproach, might cause\nto overflow in tears, was all that kept him to a sense of masculine\nsuperiority. The charming girl inspired love without leaving time to ask\nwhether she had mind enough to make it durable. But of what value is the\nthing they call in Paris _mind_ to a class whose principal element of\nhappiness is virtue and good sense?\n\nIn her moral qualities Cesarine was like her mother, somewhat bettered\nby the superfluities of education; she loved music, drew the Madonna\ndella Sedia in chalk, and read the works of Mmes. Cottin and Riccoboni,\nof Bernadin de Saint-Pierre, Fenelon, and Racine. She was never seen\nbehind the counter with her mother except for a few moments before\nsitting down to dinner, or on some special occasion when she replaced\nher. Her father and mother, like all persons who have risen from small\nbeginnings, and who cultivate the ingratitude of their children by\nputting them above themselves, delighted in deifying Cesarine, who\nhappily had the virtues of her class, and took no advantage of their\nweakness.\n\nMadame Birotteau followed the architect with an anxious and appealing\neye, watching with terror, and pointing out to her daughter, the\nfantastic movements of the four-foot rule, that wand of architects and\nbuilders, with which Grindot was measuring. She saw in those mysterious\nweavings a conjuring spirit that augured evil; she wished the walls were\nless high, the rooms less large, and dared not question the young man on\nthe effects of his sorcery.\n\n\"Do not be afraid, madame, I shall carry nothing off,\" said the artist,\nsmiling.\n\nCesarine could not help smiling.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Constance, in a supplicating voice, not even noticing\nthe tit-for-tat of the young man, \"consider economy, and later we may be\nable to serve you--\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nBefore starting to see Monsieur Molineux, the owner of the adjoining\nhouse, Cesar wished to get from Roguin the private deed about the\ntransference of the lease which Alexandre Crottat had been ordered to\ndraw up. As he left the notary's house, he saw du Tillet at the window\nof Roguin's study. Although the _liaison_ of his former clerk with the\nlawyer's wife made it not unlikely that he should see du Tillet there\nat this hour when the negotiations about the Madeleine were going on,\nBirotteau, in spite of his extreme confidence, felt uneasy. The excited\nmanner of du Tillet seemed the sign of a discussion. \"Can he be in it?\"\nthought Cesar, with a flash of commercial prudence. The suspicion passed\nlike lightning through his mind. He looked again and saw Madame Roguin,\nand the presence of du Tillet was no longer suspicious. \"Still, suppose\nConstance were right?\" he said to himself. \"What a fool I am to listen\nto women's notions! I'll speak of it to my uncle Pillerault this\nmorning; it is only a step from the Cour Batave, where Monsieur Molineux\nlives, to the Rue des Bourdonnais.\"\n\nA cautious observer, or a merchant who had met with swindlers in\nhis business career, would have been saved by this sight; but the\nantecedents of Birotteau, the incapacity of his mind, which had little\npower to follow up the chain of inductions by which a superior\nman reaches a conclusion, all conspired to blind him. He found the\numbrella-man in full dress, and they were about to start, when Virginie,\nthe cook, caught him by the arm:--\n\n\"Monsieur, madame does not wish you to go out--\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Birotteau, \"more women's notions!\"\n\n\"--without your coffee, which is ready.\"\n\n\"That's true. My neighbor,\" he said to Cayron, \"I have so many things\nin my head that I can't think of my stomach. Do me the kindness to go\nforward; we will meet at Monsieur Molineux' door, unless you are willing\nto go up and explain matters to him, which would save time.\"\n\nMonsieur Molineux was a grotesque little man, living on his rents,--a\nspecies of being that exists nowhere but in Paris, like a certain lichen\nwhich grows only in Iceland. This comparison is all the more apt because\nhe belonged to a mixed nature, to an animal-vegetable kingdom which\nsome modern Mercier might build up of cryptograms that push up upon, and\nflower, and die in or under the plastered walls of the strange unhealthy\nhouses where they prefer to cluster. The first aspect of this human\nplant--umbelliferous, judging by the fluted blue cap which crowned it,\nwith a stalk encased in greenish trousers, and bulbous roots swathed\nin list shoes--offered to the eye a flat and faded countenance, which\ncertainly betrayed nothing poisonous. In this queer product might be\nrecognized the typical stockholder, who believes every report which the\ndaily press baptizes with ink, and is content, for all response, to say,\n\"Read what the papers say,\"--the bourgeois, essentially the friend of\norder, always revolting in his moral being against power, though\nalways obeying it; a creature feeble in the mass but fierce in isolated\ncircumstances, hard as a constable when his own rights are in question,\nyet giving fresh chickweed to his bird and fish-bones to his cat,\ninterrupting the signing of a lease to whistle to a canary, suspicious\nas a jailer, but apt to put his money into a bad business and then\nendeavor to get it back by niggardly avarice. The evil savor of this\nhybrid flower was only revealed by use; its nauseous bitterness needed\nthe stewing of some business in which his interests were mingled with\nthose of other men, to bring it fully out. Like all Parisians, Molineux\nhad the lust of dominating; he craved the share of sovereignty which is\nexercised more or less by every one, even a porter, over a greater or\nlesser number of victims,--over wife, children, tenants, clerks, horses,\ndogs, monkeys, to whom they send, on the rebound, the mortifications\nthey have endured in the higher spheres to which they aspired.\n\nThis annoying old man had neither wife, child, nephew, or niece. He\nbullied his servant-of-all-work too much to make her a victim; for she\nescaped all contact with her master by doing her work and keeping out of\nhis way. His appetite for tyranny was thus balked; and to satisfy it\nin some way he patiently studied the laws relating to rentals and\nparty-walls; he fathomed the jurisprudence which regulates the dwellings\nof Paris in an infinite number of petty questions as to tenants,\nabutters, liabilities, taxes, repairs, sweepings, decorations for the\nFete-Dieu, waste-pipes, lighting, projections over the public way, and\nthe neighborhood of unhealthy buildings. His means, his strength, in\nfact his whole mind was spent in keeping his proprietary rights on a\ncomplete war-footing. He had made it an amusement, and the amusement\nhad become a monomania. He was fond of protecting citizens against\nthe encroachment of illegal proceedings; but finding such subjects of\ncomplaint rare, he had finally turned upon his own tenants. A tenant\nbecame his enemy, his inferior, his subject, his vassal; he laid claim\nto his subservience, and looked upon any man as a brute who passed\nhim on the stairway without speaking. He wrote out his bills for rent\nhimself, and sent them on the morning of the day they fell due. The\ndebtor who was behindhand in his payment received a legal notice to quit\nat an appointed time. Then followed seizures, law-suits, costs, and\nthe whole judicial array set in motion with the rapidity of what the\nhead's-man calls the \"mechanism.\" Molineux granted neither grace nor\ntime; his heart was a callus in the direction of a lease.\n\n\"I will lend you the money if you want it,\" he would say to a man he\nthought solvent, \"but pay my rent; all delays carry with them a loss of\ninterest for which the law does not indemnify us.\"\n\nAfter long study of the caprices and capers of tenants who persisted,\nafter the fashion of dynasties, in upsetting the arrangements of their\npredecessors, he had drawn up a charter of his own and followed it\nreligiously. In accordance therewith, the old fellow made no repairs:\nno chimney ever smoked, the stairs were clean, the ceilings white, the\ncornices irreproachable, the floors firm on their joists, the paint\nsatisfactory; the locks were never more than three years old, not a pane\nof glass was missing, there were no cracks, and he saw no broken tiles\nuntil a tenant vacated the premises. When he met the tenants on their\nfirst arrival he was accompanied by a locksmith and a painter and\nglazier,--very convenient folks, as he remarked. The lessee was at\nliberty to make improvements; but if the unhappy man did so, little\nMolineux thought night and day of how he could dislodge him and relet\nthe improved appartement on better terms. He watched and waited and spun\nthe web of his mischievous legal proceedings. He knew all the tricks\nof Parisian legislation in the matter of leases. Factious and fond of\nscribbling, he wrote polite and specious letters to his tenants; but at\nthe bottom of all his civil sentences could be seen, as in his faded\nand cozening face, the soul of a Shylock. He always demanded six months'\nrent in advance, to be deducted from the last quarter of the lease under\nan array of prickly conditions which he invented. If new tenants offered\nthemselves, he got information about them from the police; for he would\nnot have people of certain callings,--he was afraid, for instance, of\nhammers. When the lease was to be signed, he kept the deed and spelled\nit over for a week, fearing what he called the _et caetera_ of lawyers.\n\nOutside of his notions as a proprietor, Jean-Baptiste Molineux seemed\ngood and obliging. He played at boston without complaining of the\nplayers; he laughed at the things which make a bourgeois laugh; talked\nof what others of his kind talked about,--the arbitrary powers of\nbakers who nefariously sell false weights, of the police, of the heroic\nseventeen deputies of the Left. He read the \"Good Sense\" of the Cure\nMeslier, and went to Mass; not that he had any choice between deism and\nChristianity, but he took the wafer when offered to him, and argued that\nhe was therefore safe from the interfering claims of the clergy. The\nindefatigable litigant wrote letters on this subject to the newspapers,\nwhich the newspapers did not insert and never answered. He was in other\nrespects one of those estimable bourgeois who solemnly put Christmas\nlogs on their fire, draw kings at play, invent April-fools, stroll on\nthe boulevards when the weather is fine, go to see the skating, and are\nalways to be found on the terrace of the Place Louis XV. at two o'clock\non the days of the fireworks, with a roll in their pockets so that they\nmay get and keep a front place.\n\nThe Cour Batave, where the little old man lived, is the product of one\nof those fantastic speculations of which no man can explain the meaning\nafter they are once completed. This cloistral structure, with arcades\nand interior galleries built of free-stone, with a fountain at one\nend,--a parched fountain, which opens its lion's mouth less to give\nwater than to ask it from the passers-by,--was doubtless invented to\nendow the Saint-Denis quarter with a species of Palais-Royal. The place,\nunhealthy and buried on all four sides by the high walls of its houses,\nhas no life or movement except in the daytime; it is a central spot\nwhere dark passages meet, and connect the quarter of the markets with\nthe Saint-Martin quarter by means of the famous Rue Quincampoix,--damp\nways in which hurried foot-passengers contract rheumatism. But at night\nno spot in Paris is more deserted; it might be called the catacombs\nof commerce. In it there are various industrial _cloaca_, very\nfew Dutchmen, but a great many grocers. The apartments in this\nmerchant-place have, naturally, no other outlook than that of the common\ncourt on which all the windows give, so that rents are at a minimum.\n\nMonsieur Molineux lived in one of the angles, on the sixth floor for\nsanitary reasons, the air not being pure at a less height than seventy\nfeet above the ground. At this altitude the worthy proprietor enjoyed\nan enchanting view of the windmills of Montmartre as he walked among\nthe gutters on the roof, where he cultivated flowers, in spite of police\nregulations against the hanging gardens of our modern Babylon. His\nappartement was made up of four rooms, without counting the precious\n_anglaises_ on the floor above him of which he had the key; they\nbelonged to him, he had made them, and he felt he was legally entitled\nto them. On entering his appartement, a repulsive barrenness plainly\nshowed the avarice of the owner: in the antechamber were six straw\nchairs and a porcelain stove; on the walls, which were covered with\na bottle-green paper, were four engravings bought at auction. In the\ndining-room were two sideboards, two cages full of birds, a table\ncovered with oil-cloth, a barometer, a window-door which opened on the\nhanging gardens, and chairs of dark mahogany covered with horse-hair.\nThe salon had little curtains of some old green-silk stuff, and\nfurniture of painted white-wood covered with green worsted velvet. As\nto the chamber of the old celibate it was furnished with Louis XV.\narticles, so dirty and disfigured through long usage that a woman\ndressed in white would have been afraid of soiling herself by contact\nwith them. The chimney-piece was adorned by a clock with two columns,\nbetween which was a dial-case that served as a pedestal to Pallas\nbrandishing her lance: a myth. The floor was covered with plates full\nof scraps intended for the cats, on which there was much danger of\nstepping. Above a chest of drawers in rosewood hung a portrait done in\npastel,--Molineux in his youth. There were also books, tables covered\nwith shabby green bandboxes, on a bracket a number of his deceased\ncanaries stuffed; and, finally, a chilly bed that might formerly have\nbelonged to a Carmelite.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nCesar Birotteau was delighted with the extreme politeness of Molineux,\nwhom he found wrapped in a gray woollen dressing-gown, watching his\nmilk in a little metal heater on the edge of his fireplace, while his\ncoffee-grounds were boiling in a little brown earthenware jug from\nwhich, every now and then, he poured a few drops into his coffee-pot.\nThe umbrella-man, anxious not to disturb his landlord, had gone to the\ndoor to admit Birotteau. Molineux held the mayors and deputies of the\ncity of Paris in much esteem; he called them \"my municipal officers.\"\nAt sight of the magistrate he rose, and remained standing, cap in hand,\nuntil the great Birotteau was seated.\n\n\"No, monsieur; yes, monsieur; ah, monsieur, if I had known I should have\nhad the honor of receiving in the bosom of my humble _penates_ a member\nof the municipality of Paris, believe me I should have made it my duty\nto call upon you, although I am your landlord--or, on the point of\nbecoming so.\"\n\nBirotteau made him a sign to put on his cap.\n\n\"No, I shall not; not until you are seated, and have replaced yours,\nif you feel the cold. My room is chilly, the smallness of my means not\npermitting--God grant your wishes!\" he added, as Birotteau sneezed while\nhe felt in his pockets for the deeds. In presenting them to Molineux\nCesar remarked, to avoid all unnecessary delay, that Monsieur Roguin had\ndrawn them up.\n\n\"I do not dispute the legal talents of Monsieur Roguin, an old name\nwell-known in the notariat of Paris; but I have my own little customs, I\ndo my own business (an excusable hobby), and my notary is--\"\n\n\"But this matter is very simple,\" said the perfumer, who was used to the\nquick business methods of merchants.\n\n\"Simple!\" cried Molineux. \"Nothing is simple in such matters. Ah! you\nare not a landlord, monsieur, and you may think yourself happy. If\nyou knew to what lengths of ingratitude tenants can go, and to what\nprecautions we are driven! Why, monsieur, I once had a tenant--\"\n\nAnd for a quarter an hour he recounted how a Monsieur Gendrin, designer,\nhad deceived the vigilance of his porter, Rue Saint-Honore. Monsieur\nGendrin had committed infamies worthy of Marat,--obscene drawings at\nwhich the police winked. This Gendrin, a profoundly immoral artist,\nhad brought in women of bad lives, and made the staircase\nintolerable,--conduct worthy of a man who made caricatures of the\ngovernment. And why such conduct? Because his rent had been asked for on\nthe 15th! Gendrin and Molineux were about to have a lawsuit, for, though\nhe did not pay, Gendrin insisted on holding the empty appartement.\nMolineux received anonymous letters, no doubt from Gendrin, which\nthreatened him with assassination some night in the passages about the\nCour Batave.\n\n\"It has got to such a pass, monsieur,\" he said, winding up the tale,\n\"that monsieur the prefect of police, to whom I confided my trouble (I\nprofited by the occasion to drop him a few words on the modifications\nwhich should be introduced into the laws to meet the case), has\nauthorized me to carry pistols for my personal safety.\"\n\nThe little old man got up and fetched the pistols.\n\n\"There they are!\" he cried.\n\n\"But, monsieur, you have nothing to fear from me,\" said Birotteau,\nlooking at Cayron, and giving him a glance and a smile intended to\nexpress pity for such a man.\n\nMolineux detected it; he was mortified at such a look from an officer\nof the municipality, whose duty it was to protect all persons under\nhis administration. In any one else he might have pardoned it, but in\nBirotteau the deputy-mayor, never!\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said in a dry tone, \"an esteemed commercial judge, a\ndeputy-mayor, and an honorable merchant would not descend to such petty\nmeannesses,--for they are meannesses. But in your case there is an\nopening through the wall which must be agreed to by your landlord,\nMonsieur le comte de Grandville; there are stipulations to be made and\nagreed upon about replacing the wall at the end of your lease. Besides\nwhich, rents have hitherto been low, but they are rising; the Place\nVendome is looking up, the Rue Castiglione is to be built upon. I am\nbinding myself--binding myself down!\"\n\n\"Let us come to a settlement,\" said Birotteau, amazed. \"How much do you\nwant? I know business well enough to be certain that all your reasons\ncan be silenced by the superior consideration of money. Well, how much\nis it?\"\n\n\"That's only fair, monsieur the deputy. How much longer does your own\nlease run?\"\n\n\"Seven years,\" answered Birotteau.\n\n\"Think what my first floor will be worth in seven years!\" said Molineux.\n\"Why, what would two furnished rooms let for in that quarter?--more than\ntwo hundred francs a month perhaps! I am binding myself--binding myself\nby a lease. The rent ought to be fifteen hundred francs. At that price\nI will consent to the transfer of the two rooms by Monsieur Cayron, here\npresent,\" he said, with a sly wink at the umbrella-man; \"and I will give\nyou a lease of them for seven consecutive years. The costs of piercing\nthe wall are to belong to you; and you must procure the consent of\nMonsieur le comte de Grandville and the cession of all his rights in the\nmatter. You are responsible for all damage done in making this opening.\nYou will not be expected to replace the wall yourself, that will be\nmy business; but you will at once pay me five hundred francs as an\nindemnity towards it. We never know who may live or die, and I can't run\nafter anybody to get the wall rebuilt.\"\n\n\"Those conditions seem to me pretty fair,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"Next,\" said Molineux. \"You must pay me seven hundred and fifty francs,\n_hic et hinc_, to be deducted from the last six months of your lease;\nthis will be acknowledged in the lease itself. Oh, I will accept small\nbills for the value of the rent at any date you please! I am prompt and\nsquare in business. We will agree that you are to close up the door\non my staircase (where you are to have no right of entry), at your own\ncost, in masonry. Don't fear,--I shall ask you no indemnity for that\nat the end of your lease; I consider it included in the five hundred\nfrancs. Monsieur, you will find me just.\"\n\n\"We merchants are not so sharp,\" said the perfumer. \"It would not be\npossible to do business if we made so many stipulations.\"\n\n\"Oh, in business, that is very different, especially in perfumery, where\neverything fits like a glove,\" said the old fellow with a sour smile;\n\"but when you come to letting houses in Paris, nothing is unimportant.\nWhy, I have a tenant in the Rue Montorgeuil who--\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Birotteau, \"I am sorry to detain you from your\nbreakfast: here are the deeds, correct them. I agree to all that you\npropose, we will sign them to-morrow; but to-day let us come to an\nagreement by word of mouth, for my architect wants to take possession of\nthe premises in the morning.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" resumed Molineux with a glance at the umbrella-merchant,\n\"part of a quarter has expired; Monsieur Cayron would not wish to pay\nit; we will add it to the rest, so that your lease may run from January\nto January. It will be more in order.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"And the five per cent for the porter--\"\n\n\"But,\" said Birotteau, \"if you deprive me of the right of entrance, that\nis not fair.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are a tenant,\" said little Molineux, peremptorily, up in arms\nfor the principle. \"You must pay the tax on doors and windows and your\nshare in all the other charges. If everything is clearly understood\nthere will be no difficulty. You must be doing well, monsieur; your\naffairs are prospering?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Birotteau. \"But my motive is, I may say, something\ndifferent. I assemble my friends as much to celebrate the emancipation\nof our territory as to commemorate my promotion to the order of the\nLegion of honor--\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Molineux, \"a recompense well-deserved!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Birotteau, \"possibly I showed myself worthy of that signal\nand royal favor by my services on the Bench of commerce, and by fighting\nfor the Bourbons upon the steps of Saint-Roch on the 13th Vendemiaire.\nThese claims--\"\n\n\"Are equal to those of our brave soldiers of the old army. The ribbon is\nred, for it is dyed with their blood.\"\n\nAt these words, taken from the \"Constitutionnel,\" Birotteau could\nnot keep from inviting little Molineux to the ball, who thanked him\nprofusely and felt like forgiving the disdainful look. The old man\nconducted his new tenant as far as the landing, and overwhelmed him with\npoliteness. When Birotteau reached the middle of the Cour Batave he gave\nCayron a merry look.\n\n\"I did not think there could exist such--weak beings!\" he said, with\ndifficulty keeping back the word _fools_.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said Cayron, \"it is not everybody that has your\ntalents.\"\n\nBirotteau might easily believe himself a superior being in the presence\nof Monsieur Molineux; the answer of the umbrella-man made him smile\nagreeably, and he bowed to him with a truly royal air as they parted.\n\n\"I am close by the Markets,\" thought Cesar; \"I'll attend to the matter\nof the nuts.\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nAfter an hour's search, Birotteau, who was sent by the market-women to\nthe Rue de Lombards where nuts for sugarplums were to be found, heard\nfrom his friend Matifat that the fruit in bulk was only to be had of a\ncertain Madame Angelique Madou, living in the Rue Perrin-Gasselin, the\nsole establishment which kept the true filbert of Provence, and the\nveritable white hazel-nut of the Alps.\n\nThe Rue Perrin-Gasselin is one of the narrow thoroughfares in a square\nlabyrinth enclosed by the quay, the Rue Saint-Denis, the Rue de la\nFerronnerie, and the Rue de la Monnaie; it is, as it were, one of the\nentrails of the city. There swarm an infinite number of heterogeneous\nand mixed articles of merchandise, evil-smelling and jaunty, herrings\nand muslin, silks and honey, butter and gauze, and above all a number of\npetty trades, of which Paris knows as little as a man knows of what\nis going on in his pancreas, and which, at the present moment, had a\nblood-sucker named Bidault, otherwise called Gigonnet, a money-lender,\nwho lived in the Rue Grenetat. In this quarter old stables were filled\nwith oil-casks, and the carriage-houses were packed with bales of\ncotton. Here were stored in bulk the articles that were sold at retail\nin the markets.\n\nMadame Madou, formerly a fish-woman, but thrown, some ten years since,\ninto the dried-fruit trade by a liaison with the former proprietor of\nher present business (an affair which had long fed the gossip of the\nmarkets), had originally a vigorous and enticing beauty, now lost\nhowever in a vast embonpoint. She lived on the lower floor of a yellow\nhouse, which was falling to ruins, and was held together at each story\nby iron cross-bars. The deceased proprietor had succeeded in getting rid\nof all competitors, and had made his business a monopoly. In spite of a\nfew slight defects of education, his heiress was able to carry it along,\nand take care of her stores, which were in coachhouses, stables, and\nold workshops, where she fought the vermin with eminent success. Not\ntroubled with desk or ledgers, for she could neither read nor write, she\nanswered a letter with a blow of her fist, considering it an insult. In\nthe main she was a good woman, with a high-colored face, and a foulard\ntied over her cap, who mastered with bugle voice the wagoners when they\nbrought the merchandise; such squabbles usually ending in a bottle\nof the \"right sort.\" She had no disputes with the agriculturists who\nconsigned her the fruit, for they corresponded in ready money,--the only\npossible method of communication, to receive which Mere Madou paid them\na visit in the fine season of the year.\n\nBirotteau found this shrewish trader among sacks of filberts, nuts, and\nchestnuts.\n\n\"Good-morning, my dear lady,\" said Birotteau with a jaunty air.\n\n\"_Your_ dear!\" she said. \"Hey! my son, what's there agreeable between\nus? Did we ever mount guard over kings and queens together?\"\n\n\"I am a perfumer, and what is more I am deputy-mayor of the second\narrondissement; thus, as magistrate and as customer, I request you to\ntake another tone with me.\"\n\n\"I marry when I please,\" said the virago. \"I don't trouble the mayor, or\nbother his deputies. As for my customers, they adore me, and I talk to\n'em as I choose. If they don't like it, they can snake off elsewhere.\"\n\n\"This is the result of monopoly,\" thought Birotteau.\n\n\"Popole!--that's my godson,--he must have got into mischief. Have you\ncome about him, my worthy magistrate?\" she said, softening her voice.\n\n\"No; I had the honor to tell you that I came as a customer.\"\n\n\"Well, well! and what's your name, my lad? Haven't seen you about\nbefore, have I?\"\n\n\"If you take that tone, you ought to sell your nuts cheap,\" said\nBirotteau, who proceeded to give his name and all his distinctions.\n\n\"Ha! you're the Birotteau that's got the handsome wife. And how many of\nthe sweet little nuts may you want, my love?\"\n\n\"Six thousand weight.\"\n\n\"That's all I have,\" said the seller, in a voice like a hoarse flute.\n\"My dear monsieur, you are not one of the sluggards who waste their time\non girls and perfumes. God bless you, you've got something to do! Excuse\nme a bit. You'll be a jolly customer, dear to the heart of the woman I\nlove best in the world.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Hey! the dear Madame Madou.\"\n\n\"What's the price of your nuts?\"\n\n\"For you, old fellow, twenty-five francs a hundred, if you take them\nall.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five francs!\" cried Birotteau. \"Fifteen hundred francs! I shall\nwant perhaps a hundred thousand a year.\"\n\n\"But just look how fine they are; fresh as a daisy,\" she said, plunging\nher red arm into a sack of filberts. \"Plump, no empty ones, my dear\nman. Just think! grocers sell their beggarly trash at twenty-four sous\na pound, and in every four pounds they put a pound of _hollows_. Must I\nlose my profits to oblige you? You're nice enough, but you don't please\nme all that! If you want so many, we might make a bargain at twenty\nfrancs. I don't want to send away a deputy-mayor,--bad luck to the\nbrides, you know! Now, just handle those nuts; heavy, aren't they? Less\nthan fifty to the pound; no worms there, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Well, then, send six thousand weight, for two thousand francs at ninety\ndays' sight, to my manufactory, Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, to-morrow\nmorning early.\"\n\n\"You're in as great a hurry as a bride! Well, adieu, monsieur the mayor;\ndon't bear me a grudge. But if it is all the same to you,\" she added,\nfollowing Birotteau through the yard, \"I would like your note at forty\ndays, because I have let you have them too cheap, and I don't want to\nlose the discount. Pere Gigonnet may have a tender heart, but he sucks\nthe soul out of us as a spider sucks a fly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, fifty days. But they are to be weighed by the hundred\npounds, so that there may be no hollow ones. Without that, no bargain.\"\n\n\"Ah, the dog! he knows what he's about,\" said Madame Madou; \"can't make\na fool of him! It is those rascals in the Rue des Lombards who have\nput him up to that! Those big wolves are all in a pack to eat up the\ninnocent lambs.\"\n\nThis lamb was five feet high and three feet round, and she looked like a\nmile-post, dressed in striped calico, without a belt.\n\nThe perfumer, lost in thought, was ruminating as he went along the Rue\nSaint-Honore about his duel with Macassar Oil. He was meditating on\nthe labels and the shape of the bottles, discussing the quality of the\ncorks, the color of the placards. And yet people say there is no poetry\nin commerce! Newton did not make more calculations for his famous\nbinomial than Birotteau made for his Comagene Essence,--for by this time\nthe Oil had subsided into an Essence, and he went from one description\nto the other without observing any difference. His head spun with his\ncomputations, and he took the lively activity of its emptiness for the\nsubstantial work of real talent. He was so preoccupied that he passed\nthe turn leading to his uncle's house in the Rue des Bourdonnais, and\nhad to return upon his steps.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nClaude-Joseph Pillerault, formerly an iron-monger at the sign of the\nCloche d'Or, had one of those faces whose beauty shines from the inner\nto the outer; about him all things harmonized,--dress and manners, mind\nand heart, thought and speech, words and acts. He was the sole relation\nof Madame Birotteau, and had centred all his affections upon her and\nupon Cesarine, having lost, in the course of his commercial career, his\nwife and son, and also an adopted child, the son of his house-keeper.\nThese heavy losses had driven the good man into a kind of Christian\nstoicism,--a noble doctrine, which gave life to his existence, and\ncolored his latter days with the warm, and at the same time chilling,\ntones which gild the sunsets of winter. His head, thin and hollowed and\nswarthy, with ochre and bistre tints harmoniously blended, offered\na striking likeness to that which artists bestow on Time, though it\nvulgarized it; for the habits of commercial life lowered the stern\nand monumental character which painters, sculptors, and clock-makers\nexaggerate. Of medium height, Pillerault was more thick-set than stout;\nNature had built him for hard work and long life; his broad shoulders\nshowed a strong frame; he was dry by temperament, and his skin had,\nas it were, no emotions, though it was not insensible. Little\ndemonstrative, as was shown by his composed face and quiet attitude, the\nold man had an inward calm not expressed in phrases nor by emphasis.\nHis eye, the pupil of which was green, mingled with black lines, was\nremarkable for its unalterable clearness. His forehead, wrinkled in\nstraight lines and yellowed by time, was small and narrow, hard, and\ncrowned with silver-gray hair cut so short that it looked like felt. His\ndelicate mouth showed prudence, but not avarice. The vivacity of his\neye showed the purity of his life. Integrity, a sense of duty, and true\nmodesty made, as it were, a halo round his head, bringing his face into\nthe relief of a sound and healthful existence.\n\nFor sixty years he had led the hard and sober life of a determined\nworker. His history was like Cesar's, except in happiness. A clerk till\nthirty years of age, his property was all in his business at the time\nwhen Cesar put his savings into the Funds; he had suffered, like others,\nunder the Maximum, and the pickaxes and other implements of his\ntrade had been requisitioned. His reserved and judicious nature, his\nforethought and mathematical reflection, were seen in his methods of\nwork. The greater part of his business was conducted by word of mouth,\nand he seldom encountered difficulties. Like all thoughtful people he\nwas a great observer; he let people talk, and then studied them. He\noften refused advantageous bargains on which his neighbors pounced;\nlater, when they regretted them, they declared that Pillerault had\n\"a nose for swindlers.\" He preferred small and certain gains to bold\nstrokes which put large sums of money in jeopardy. He dealt in cast-iron\nchimney backs, gridirons, coarse fire-dogs, kettles and boilers in\ncast or wrought iron, hoes, and all the agricultural implements of the\npeasantry. This line, which was sufficiently unremunerative, required an\nimmense mechanical toil. The gains were not in proportion to the labor;\nthe profits on such heavy articles, difficult to move and expensive\nto store, were small. He himself had nailed up many a case, packed and\nunpacked many a bale, unloaded many a wagon. No fortune was ever more\nnobly won, more legitimate or more honorable, than his. He had never\novercharged or sought to force a bargain. In his latter business days\nhe might be seen smoking his pipe before the door of his shop looking\nat the passers-by, and watching his clerks as they worked. In 1814, the\nperiod at which he retired from business, his fortune consisted, in the\nfirst place, of seventy thousand francs, which he placed in the public\nFunds, and from which he derived an income of five thousand and some odd\nhundred francs a year; next of forty thousand francs, the value of his\nbusiness, which he had sold to one of his clerks; this sum was to be\npaid in full at the end of five years, without interest. Engaged for\nthirty years in a business which amounted to a hundred thousand francs\na year, he had made about seven per cent profit on the amount, and his\nliving had absorbed one half of that profit. Such was his record. His\nneighbors, little envious of such mediocrity, praised his excellence\nwithout understanding it.\n\nAt the corner of the Rue de la Monnaie and the Rue Saint-Honore is\nthe cafe David, where a few old merchants, like Pillerault, take their\ncoffee in the evenings. There, the adoption of the son of his cook had\nbeen the subject of a few jests, such as might be addressed to a man\nmuch respected, for the iron-monger inspired respectful esteem, though\nhe never sought it; his inward self-respect sufficed him. So when\nhe lost the young man, two hundred friends followed the body to the\ncemetery. In those days he was heroic. His sorrow, restrained like that\nof all men who are strong without assumption, increased the sympathy\nfelt in his neighborhood for the \"worthy man,\"--a term applied to\nPillerault in a tone which broadened its meaning and ennobled it. The\nsobriety of Claude Pillerault, long become a habit, did not yield before\nthe pleasures of an idle life when, on quitting his business, he sought\nthe rest which drags down so many of the Parisian bourgeoisie. He kept\nup his former ways of life, and enlivened his old age by convictions\nand interests, which belonged, we must admit, to the extreme Left.\nPillerault belonged to that working-men's party which the Revolution\nhad fused with the bourgeoisie. The only blot upon his character was the\nimportance he attached to the triumph of that party; he held to all the\nrights, to the liberty, and to the fruits of the Revolution; he believed\nthat his peace of mind and his political stability were endangered by\nthe Jesuits, whose secret power was proclaimed aloud by the Liberals,\nand menaced by the principles with which the \"Constitutionnel\" endowed\nMonsieur. He was quite consistent in his life and ideas; there was\nnothing narrow about his politics; he never insulted his adversaries, he\ndreaded courtiers and believed in republican virtues; he thought Manuel\na pure man, General Foy a great one, Casimir Perier without ambition,\nLafayette a political prophet, and Courier a worthy fellow. He had\nindeed some noble chimeras. The fine old man lived a family life; he\nwent about among the Ragons, his niece Birotteau, the judge Popinot,\nJoseph Lebas, and his friend Matifat. Fifteen hundred francs a year\nsufficed for all his personal wants. As to the rest of his income he\nspent it on good deeds, and in presents to his great-niece; he gave a\ndinner four times a year to his friends, at Roland's, Rue du Hasard,\nand took them afterwards to the theatre. He played the part of those old\nbachelors on whom married women draw at sight for their amusements,--a\ncountry jaunt, the opera, the Montagnes-Beaujon, _et caetera_.\nPillerault was made happy by the pleasure he gave; his joys were in the\nhearts of others. Though he had sold his business, he did not wish to\nleave the neighborhood to which all his habits tied him; and he took\na small appartement of three rooms in the Rue des Bourdonnais on the\nfourth floor of an old house.\n\nJust as the moral nature of Molineux could be seen in his strange\ninterior, the pure and simple life of Pillerault was revealed by\nthe arrangements of his modest home, consisting of an antechamber, a\nsitting-room, and a bed-room. Judged by dimensions, it was the cell of a\nTrappist. The antechamber, with a red-tiled floor, had only one window,\nscreened by a cambric curtain with a red border; mahogany chairs,\ncovered with reddish sheep's leather put on with gilt nails, walls hung\nwith an olive-green paper, and otherwise decorated with the American\nDeclaration of Independence, a portrait of Bonaparte as First Consul,\nand a representation of the battle of Austerlitz. The salon, decorated\nundoubtedly by an upholsterer, had a set of furniture with arched\ntops covered in yellow, a carpet, chimney ornaments of bronze without\ngilding, a painted chimney-board, a console bearing a vase of flowers\nunder a glass case, a round table covered with a cloth, on which stood\na liqueur-stand. The newness of this room proclaimed a sacrifice made by\nthe old man to the conventions of the world; for he seldom received\nany one at home. In his bedroom, as plain as that of a monk or an old\nsoldier (the two men best able to estimate life), a crucifix with a\nbasin of holy-water first caught the eye. This profession of faith in a\nstoical old republican was strangely moving to the heart of a spectator.\n\nAn old woman came to do his household work; but his respect for\nwomen was so great that he would not let her black his boots, and he\nsubscribed to a boot-black for that service. His dress was simple, and\ninvariably the same. He wore a coat and trousers of dark-blue cloth, a\nwaistcoat of some printed cotton fabric, a white cravat, high shoes, and\non gala days he put on a coat with brass buttons. His habits of rising,\nbreakfasting, going out, dining, his evening resorts, and his returning\nhours were all stamped with the strictest punctuality; for regular\nhabits are the secret of long life and sound health. Politics never came\nto the surface in his intercourse with Cesar, the Ragons, or the Abbe\nLoraux; for the good people of that circle knew each other too well to\ncare to enter the region of proselytism. Like his nephew and like the\nRagons, he put implicit confidence in Roguin. To his mind the notary\nwas a being worthy of veneration,--the living image of probity. In the\naffair of the lands about the Madeleine, Pillerault had undertaken a\nprivate examination, which was the real cause of the boldness with which\nCesar had combated his wife's presentiments.\n\nThe perfumer went up the seventy-eight stairs which led to the little\nbrown door of his uncle's appartement, thinking as he went that the old\nman must be very hale to mount them daily without complaining. He found\na frock-coat and pair of trousers hanging on the hat-stand outside\nthe door. Madame Vaillant brushed and cleaned them while this genuine\nphilosopher, wrapped in a gray woollen garment, breakfasted in\nhis chimney-corner and read the parliamentary debates in the\n\"Constitutionnel\" or the \"Journal du Commerce.\"\n\n\"Uncle,\" said Cesar, \"the matter is settled; they are drawing up their\ndeeds; but you have any fears or regrets, there is still time to give it\nup.\"\n\n\"Why should I give it up? The thing is good; though it may be a long\ntime before we realize anything, like all safe investments. My\nfifty thousand francs are in the bank. I received yesterday the last\ninstalment, five thousand francs, from my business. As for the Ragons,\nthey have put their whole fortune into the affair.\"\n\n\"How do they contrive to life?\"\n\n\"Never mind how; they do live.\"\n\n\"Uncle, I understand!\" said Birotteau, deeply moved, pressing the hand\nof the austere old man.\n\n\"How is the affair arranged?\" asked Pillerault, brusquely.\n\n\"I am in for three eighths, you and the Ragons for one eighth. I shall\ncredit you for that on my books until the question of registration is\ndecided.\"\n\n\"Good! My boy, you must be getting rich to put three hundred thousand\nfrancs into it. It seems to me you are risking a good deal outside of\nyour business. Won't the business suffer? However, that is your affair.\nIf you get a set-back, why the Funds are at eighty, and I could sell two\nthousand francs worth of my consolidated stock. But take care, my lad;\nfor if you have to come upon me, it will be your daughter's fortune that\nyou will take.\"\n\n\"Ah! my uncle, how simply you say things! You touch my heart.\"\n\n\"General Foy was touching mine in quite another fashion just now. Well,\ngo on; settle the business; lands can't fly away. We are getting them at\nhalf price. Suppose we do have to wait six years, there will always be\nsome returns; there are wood-yards which will bring in a rent. We can't\nreally lose anything. There is but one chance against us. Roguin might\nrun off with the money.\"\n\n\"My wife told me so this very night. She fears--\"\n\n\"That Roguin will carry off our funds?\" said Pillerault, laughing.\n\"Pray, why?\"\n\n\"She says there is too much in his nose; and like men who can't have\nwomen, he is furious to--\"\n\nWith a smile of incredulity, Pillerault tore a strip from a little book,\nwrote down an amount, and signed the paper.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"there's a cheque on the Bank of France for a hundred\nthousand francs for the Ragons and for me. Those poor folks have just\nsold to your scoundrel of a du Tillet their fifteen shares in the mines\nat Wortschin to make up the amount. Worthy people in trouble,--it\nwrings my heart; and such good, noble souls, the very flower of the old\nbourgeoisie! Their brother, Popinot, the judge, knows nothing about\nit; they hid it from him so that he may not feel obliged to give up\nhis other works of charity. People who have worked, like me, for forty\nyears!\"\n\n\"God grant that the Oil of Comagene may triumph!\" cried Birotteau. \"I\nshall be doubly happy. Adieu; come and dine on Sunday with the Ragons,\nRoguin, and Monsieur Claparon. We shall sign the papers the day after\nto-morrow, for to-morrow is Friday, you know, and I shouldn't like--\"\n\n\"You don't surely give in to such superstitions?\"\n\n\"Uncle, I shall never believe that the day on which the Son of God was\nput to death by man can be a fortunate day. Why, we ourselves stop all\nbusiness on the twenty-first of January.\"\n\n\"On Sunday, then,\" said Pillerault brusquely.\n\n\"If it were not for his political opinions,\" thought Birotteau as he\nwent down stairs, \"I don't believe he would have his equal here below.\nWhat are politics to him? He would be just as well off if he never\nthought of them. His obstinacy in that direction only shows that there\ncan't be a perfect man.\"\n\n\"Three o'clock already!\" cried Cesar, as he got back to \"The Queen of\nRoses.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, do you mean to take these securities?\" asked Celestin,\nshowing him the notes of the umbrella-maker.\n\n\"Yes; at six per cent, without commission. Wife, get my dressing things\nall ready; I am going to see Monsieur Vauquelin,--you know why. A white\ncravat, of course.\"\n\nBirotteau gave a few orders to the clerks. Not seeing Popinot, he\nconcluded that his future partner had gone to dress; and he went\ngaily up to his room, where the Dresden Madonna, magnificently framed\naccording to his orders, awaited him.\n\n\"Hey! that's pretty,\" he said to his daughter.\n\n\"Papa, you must say beautiful, or people will laugh at you.\"\n\n\"Upon my word! a daughter who scolds her father! Well, well! To my\ntaste I like Hero and Leander quite as much. The Virgin is a religious\nsubject, suitable for a chapel; but Hero and Leander, ah! I shall buy\nit, for that flask of oil gave me an idea--\"\n\n\"Papa, I don't know what you are talking about.\"\n\n\"Virginie! a hackney-coach!\" cried Cesar, in stentorian tones, as soon\nas he had trimmed his beard and seen little Popinot appear, who was\ndragging his foot timidly because Cesarine was there.\n\nThe lover had never yet perceived that his infirmity no longer existed\nin the eyes of his mistress. Delicious sign of love!--which they on whom\nchance has inflicted a bodily imperfection can alone obtain.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"the press will be ready to work to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter, Popinot?\" asked Cesar, as he saw Anselme blush.\n\n\"Monsieur, it is the joy of having found a shop, a back-shop, kitchen,\nchambers above them, and store-rooms,--all for twelve hundred francs a\nyear, in the Rue des Cinq-Diamants.\"\n\n\"We must take a lease of eighteen years,\" said Birotteau. \"But let us\nstart for Monsieur Vauquelin's. We can talk as we go.\"\n\nCesar and Popinot got into the hackney-coach before the eyes of the\nastonished clerks, who did not know what to make of these gorgeous\ntoilets and the abnormal coach, ignorant as they were of the great\nproject revolving in the mind of the master of \"The Queen of Roses.\"\n\n\"We are going to hear the truth about nuts,\" said Cesar, half to\nhimself.\n\n\"Nuts?\" said Popinot.\n\n\"There you have my secret,\" said the perfumer. \"I've let loose the word\n_nuts_,--all is there. The oil of nuts is the only oil that has any real\neffect upon hair. No perfumer has ever dreamed of it. I saw an engraving\nof Hero and Leander, and I said to myself, If the ancients used all that\noil on their heads they had some reason for it; for the ancients are the\nancients, in spite of all the moderns may say; I stand by Boileau about\nthe ancients. I took my departure from that point and got the oil of\nnuts, thanks to your relation, little Bianchon the medical student; he\ntold me that at school his comrades used nut oil to promote the growth\nof their whiskers and mustachios. All we need is the approval of\nMonsieur Vauquelin; enlightened by his science, we shall mislead the\npublic. I was in the markets just now, talking to a seller of nuts, so\nas to get hold of the raw material, and now I am about to meet one of\nthe greatest scientific men in France, to get at the quintessence of\nthat commodity. Proverbs are no fools; extremes meet. Now see, my boy,\ncommerce is the intermediary between the productions of the vegetable\nkingdom and science. Angelique Madou gathers, Monsieur Vauquelin\nextracts, we sell an essence. Nuts are worth five sous a pound, Monsieur\nVauquelin will increase their value one hundredfold, and we shall,\nperhaps, do a service to humanity; for if vanity is the cause of the\ngreatest torments of mankind, a good cosmetic becomes a benefaction.\"\n\nThe religious admiration with which Popinot listened to the father\nof Cesarine stimulated Birotteau's eloquence, who allowed himself\nto expatiate in phrases which certainly were extremely wild for a\nbourgeois.\n\n\"Be respectful, Anselme,\" he said, as they reached the street where\nMonsieur Vauquelin lived, \"we are about to enter the sanctuary of\nscience. Put the Virgin in full sight, but not ostentatiously, in the\ndining-room, on a chair. Pray heaven, I may not get mixed up in what I\nhave to say!\" cried Cesar, naively. \"Popinot, this man has a chemical\neffect upon me; his voice heats my stomach, and even gives me a slight\ncolic. He is my benefactor, and in a few moments he will be yours.\"\n\nThese words struck Popinot with a cold chill, and he began to step as\nif he were walking on eggs, looking nervously at the wall. Monsieur\nVauquelin was in his study when Birotteau was announced. The academician\nknew that the perfumer and deputy-mayor was high in favor, and he\nadmitted him.\n\n\"You do not forget me in the midst of your distinctions,\" he said,\n\"there is only a hand's-breadth, however, between a chemist and a\nperfumer.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur! between your genius and the plainness of a man like me\nthere is infinity. I owe to you what you call my distinctions: I shall\nnever forget it in this world, nor in the next.\"\n\n\"Oh! in the next they say we shall be all alike, kings and cobblers.\"\n\n\"Provided kings and cobblers lead a holy life here below,\" said\nBirotteau.\n\n\"Is that your son?\" asked Vauquelin, looking at little Popinot, who was\namazed at not seeing anything extraordinary in the sanctum, where he\nexpected to find monstrosities, gigantic engines, flying-machines, and\nmaterial substances all alive.\n\n\"No, monsieur, but a young man whom I love, and who comes to ask a\nkindness equal to your genius,--and that is infinite,\" said Cesar with\nshrewd courtesy. \"We have come to consult you, a second time, on an\nimportant matter, about which I am ignorant as a perfumer can be.\"\n\n\"Let me hear what it is.\"\n\n\"I know that hair has lately occupied all your vigils, and that you have\ngiven yourself up to analyzing it; while you have thought of glory, I\nhave thought of commerce.\"\n\n\"Dear Monsieur Birotteau, what is it you want of me,--the analysis of\nhair?\" He took up a little paper. \"I am about to read before the Academy\nof Sciences a monograph on that subject. Hair is composed of a rather\nlarge quantity of mucus, a small quantity of white oil, a great deal of\ngreenish oil, iron, a few atoms of oxide of manganese, some phosphate of\nlime, a tiny quantity of carbonate of lime, a little silica, and a good\ndeal of sulphur. The differing proportions of these component parts\ncause the differences in the color of the hair. Red hair, for instance,\nhas more greenish oil than any other.\"\n\nCesar and Popinot opened their eyes to a laughable extent.\n\n\"Nine things!\" cried Birotteau. \"What! are there metals and oils in\nhair? Unless I heard it from you, a man I venerate, I could not believe\nit. How amazing! God is great, Monsieur Vauquelin.\"\n\n\"Hair is produced by a follicular organ,\" resumed the great chemist,--\"a\nspecies of pocket, or sack, open at both extremities. By one end it is\nfastened to the nerves and the blood vessels; from the other springs the\nhair itself. According to some of our scientific brotherhood, among them\nMonsieur Blainville, the hair is really a dead matter expelled from that\npouch, or crypt, which is filled with a species of pulp.\"\n\n\"Then hair is what you might call threads of sweat!\" cried Popinot, to\nwhom Cesar promptly administered a little kick on his heels.\n\nVauquelin smiled at Popinot's idea.\n\n\"He knows something, doesn't he?\" said Cesar, looking at Popinot. \"But,\nmonsieur, if the hair is still-born, it is impossible to give it life,\nand I am lost! my prospectus will be ridiculous. You don't know how\nqueer the public is; you can't go and tell it--\"\n\n\"That it has got manure upon its head,\" said Popinot, wishing to make\nVauquelin laugh again.\n\n\"Cephalic catacombs,\" said Vauquelin, continuing the joke.\n\n\"My nuts are bought!\" cried Birotteau, alive to the commercial loss. \"If\nthis is so why do they sell--\"\n\n\"Don't be frightened,\" said Vauquelin, smiling, \"I see it is a question\nof some secret about making the hair grow or keeping it from turning\ngray. Listen! this is my opinion on the subject, as the result of my\nstudies.\"\n\nHere Popinot pricked up his ears like a frightened hare.\n\n\"The discoloration of this substance, be it living or dead, is, in my\njudgment, produced by a check to the secretion of the coloring matter;\nwhich explains why in certain cold climates the fur of animals loses all\ncolor and turns white in winter.\"\n\n\"Hein! Popinot.\"\n\n\"It is evident,\" resumed Vauquelin, \"that alterations in the color of\nthe hair come from changes in the circumjacent atmosphere--\"\n\n\"Circumjacent, Popinot! recollect, hold fast to that,\" cried Cesar.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Vauquelin, \"from hot and cold changes, or from internal\nphenomena which produce the same effect. Probably headaches and other\ncephalagic affections absorb, dissipate, or displace the generating\nfluids. However, the interior of the head concerns physicians. As for\nthe exterior, bring on your cosmetics.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Birotteau, \"you restore me to life! I have thought of\nselling an oil of nuts, believing that the ancients made use of that oil\nfor their hair; and the ancients are the ancients, as you know: I agree\nwith Boileau. Why did the gladiators oil themselves--\"\n\n\"Olive oil is quite as good as nut oil,\" said Vauquelin, who was not\nlistening to Birotteau. \"All oil is good to preserve the bulb from\nreceiving injury to the substances working within it, or, as we should\nsay in chemistry, in liquefaction. Perhaps you are right; Dupuytren\ntold me the oil of nuts had a stimulating property. I will look into\nthe differences between the various oils, beech-nut, colza, olive, and\nhazel, etc.\"\n\n\"Then I am not mistaken,\" cried Birotteau, triumphantly. \"I have\ncoincided with a great man. Macassar is overthrown! Macassar, monsieur,\nis a cosmetic given--that is, sold, and sold dear--to make the hair\ngrow.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Birotteau,\" said Vauquelin, \"there are not two ounces\nof Macassar oil in all Europe. Macassar oil has not the slightest action\nupon the hair; but the Malays buy it up for its weight in gold, thinking\nthat it preserves the hair: they don't know that whale-oil is just as\ngood. No power, chemical, or divine--\"\n\n\"Divine! oh, don't say that, Monsieur Vauquelin.\"\n\n\"But, my dear monsieur, the first law of God is to be consistent with\nHimself; without unity, no power--\"\n\n\"Ah! in that light--\"\n\n\"No power, as I say, can make the hair grow on bald heads; just as\nyou can never dye, without serious danger, red or white hair. But in\nadvertising the benefits of oil you commit no mistake, you tell no\nfalsehood, and I think that those who use it will probably preserve\ntheir hair.\"\n\n\"Do you think that the royal Academy of Sciences would approve of--\"\n\n\"Oh! there is no discovery in all that,\" said Vauquelin. \"Besides,\ncharlatans have so abused the name of the Academy that it would not help\nyou much. My conscience will not allow me to think the oil of nuts a\nprodigy.\"\n\n\"What would be the best way to extract it; by pressure, or decoction?\"\nasked Birotteau.\n\n\"Pressure between two hot slabs will cause the oil to flow more\nabundantly; but if obtained by pressure between cold slabs it will be\nof better quality. It should be applied to the skin itself,\" added\nVauquelin, kindly, \"and not to the hair; otherwise the effect might be\nlost.\"\n\n\"Recollect all that, Popinot,\" said Birotteau, with an enthusiasm that\nsent a glow into his face. \"You see before you, monsieur, a young man\nwho will count this day among the finest in his life. He knew you, he\nvenerated you, without ever having seen you. We often talk of you in our\nhome: a name that is in the heart is often on the lips. We pray for\nyou every day, my wife and daughter and I, as we ought to pray for our\nbenefactor.\"\n\n\"Too much for so little,\" said Vauquelin, rather bored by the voluble\ngratitude of the perfumer.\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta!\" exclaimed Birotteau, \"you can't prevent our loving you,\nyou who will take nothing from us. You are like the sun; you give light,\nand those whom you illuminate can give you nothing in return.\"\n\nThe man of science smiled and rose; the perfumer and Popinot rose also.\n\n\"Anselme, look well at this room. You permit it, monsieur? Your time is\nprecious, I know, but he will never have another opportunity.\"\n\n\"Well, have you got all you wanted?\" said Vauquelin to Birotteau. \"After\nall, we are both commercial men.\"\n\n\"Pretty nearly, monsieur,\" said Birotteau, retreating towards the\ndining-room, Vauquelin following. \"But to launch our Comagene Essence we\nneed a good foundation--\"\n\n\"'Comagene' and 'Essence' are two words that clash. Call your cosmetic\n'Oil of Birotteau'; or, if you don't want to give your name to the\nworld, find some other. Why, there's the Dresden Madonna! Ah, Monsieur\nBirotteau, do you mean that we shall quarrel?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Vauquelin,\" said the perfumer, taking the chemist's hand.\n\"This treasure has no value except the time that I have spent in finding\nit. We had to ransack all Germany to find it on China paper before\nlettering. I knew that you wished for it and that your occupations\ndid not leave you time to search for it; I have been your commercial\ntraveller, that is all. Accept therefore, not a paltry engraving, but\nefforts, anxieties, despatches to and fro, which are the evidence of my\ncomplete devotion. Would that you had wished for something growing on\nthe sides of precipices, that I might have sought it and said to you,\n'Here it is!' Do not refuse my gift. We have so much reason to be\nforgotten; allow me therefore to place myself, my wife, my daughter, and\nthe son-in-law I expect to have, beneath your eyes. You must say when\nyou look at the Virgin, 'There are some people in the world who are\nthinking of me.'\"\n\n\"I accept,\" said Vauquelin.\n\nPopinot and Birotteau wiped their eyes, so affected were they by the\nkindly tone in which the academician uttered the words.\n\n\"Will you crown your goodness?\" said the perfumer.\n\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed Vauquelin.\n\n\"I assemble my friends\"--he rose from his heels, taking, nevertheless,\na modest air--\"as much to celebrate the emancipation of our territory as\nto commemorate my promotion to the order of the Legion of honor--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Vauquelin, surprised.\n\n\"Possibly I showed myself worthy of that signal and royal favor, by my\nservices on the Bench of commerce, and by fighting for the Bourbons upon\nthe steps of Saint-Roch, on the 13th Vendemiaire, where I was wounded\nby Napoleon. My wife gives a ball, three weeks from Sunday; pray come to\nit, monsieur. Do us the honor to dine with us on that day. Your presence\nwould double the happiness with which I receive my cross. I will write\nyou beforehand.\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" said Vauquelin.\n\n\"My heart swells with joy!\" cried the perfumer, when he got into the\nstreet. \"He comes to my house! I am afraid I've forgotten what he said\nabout hair: do you remember it, Popinot!\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; and twenty years hence I shall remember it still.\"\n\n\"What a great man! what a glance, what penetration!\" said Birotteau.\n\"Ah! he made no bones about it; he guessed our thoughts at the first\nword; he has given us the means of annihilating Macassar oil. Yes!\nnothing can make the hair grow; Macassar, you lie! Popinot, our fortune\nis made. We'll go to the manufactory to-morrow morning at seven o'clock;\nthe nuts will be there, and we will press out some oil. It is all very\nwell for him to say that any oil is good; if the public knew that, we\nshould be lost. If we didn't put some scent and the name of nuts into\nthe oil, how could we sell it for three or four francs the four ounces?\"\n\n\"You are about to be decorated, monsieur?\" said Popinot, \"what glory\nfor--\"\n\n\"Commerce; that is true, my boy.\"\n\nCesar's triumphant air, as if certain of fortune, was observed by the\nclerks, who made signs at each other; for the trip in the hackney-coach,\nand the full dress of the cashier and his master had thrown them all\ninto the wildest regions of romance. The mutual satisfaction of Cesar\nand Anselme, betrayed by looks diplomatically exchanged, the glance full\nof hope which Popinot cast now and then at Cesarine, proclaimed some\ngreat event and gave color to the conjectures of the clerks. In their\nbusy and half cloistral life the smallest events have the interest which\na prisoner feels in those of his prison. The bearing of Madame Cesar,\nwho replied to the Olympian looks of her lord with an air of distrust,\nseemed to point to some new enterprise; for in ordinary times Madame\nCesar, delighted with the smallest routine success, would have shared\nhis contentment. It happened, accidentally, that the receipts for the\nday amounted to more than six thousand francs; for several outstanding\nbills chanced to be paid.\n\nThe dining-room and the kitchen, lighted from a little court, and\nseparated from the dining-room by a passage, from which the staircase,\ntaken out of a corner of the backshop, opened up, was on the _entresol_\nwhere in former days Cesar and Constance had their appartement; in fact,\nthe dining-room, where the honey-moon had been passed, still wore the\nlook of a little salon. During dinner Raguet, the trusty boy of all\nwork, took charge of the shop; but the clerks came down when the dessert\nwas put on table, leaving Cesar, his wife and daughter to finish their\ndinner alone by the chimney corner. This habit was derived from the\nRagons, who kept up the old-fashioned usages and customs of former\ncommercial days, which placed an enormous distance between the masters\nand the apprentices. Cesarine or Constance then prepared for Birotteau\nhis cup of coffee, which he took sitting on a sofa by the corner of the\nfire. At this hour he told his wife all the little events of the day,\nand related what he had seen in the streets, what was going on in\nthe Faubourg du Temple, and the difficulties he had met with in the\nmanufactory, _et caetera_.\n\n\"Wife,\" he said, when the clerks had gone down, \"this is certainly\none of the most important days in our life! The nuts are bought, the\nhydraulic press is ready to go to work, the land affair is settled.\nHere, lock up that cheque on the Bank of France,\" he added, handing\nher Pillerault's paper. \"The improvements in the house are ordered, the\ndignity of our appartement is about to be increased. Bless me! I saw,\ndown in the Cour Batave, a very singular man,\"--and he told the tale of\nMonsieur Molineux.\n\n\"I see,\" said his wife, interrupting him in the middle of a tirade,\n\"that you have gone in debt two hundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"That is true, wife,\" said Cesar, with mock humility, \"Good God, how\nshall we pay them? It counts for nothing that the lands about the\nMadeleine will some day become the finest quarter of Paris.\"\n\n\"Some day, Cesar!\"\n\n\"Alas!\" he said, going on with his joke, \"my three eighths will only\nbe worth a million in six years. How shall I ever pay that two hundred\nthousand francs?\" said Cesar, with a gesture of alarm. \"Well, we shall\nbe reduced to pay them with that,\" he added, pulling from his pocket a\nnut, which he had taken from Madame Madou and carefully preserved.\n\nHe showed the nut between his fingers to Constance and Cesarine. His\nwife was silent, but Cesarine, much puzzled, said to her father, as she\ngave him his coffee, \"What do you mean, papa,--are you joking?\"\n\nThe perfumer, as well as the clerks, had detected during dinner the\nglances which Popinot had cast at Cesarine, and he resolved to clear up\nhis suspicions.\n\n\"Well, my little daughter,\" he said, \"this nut will revolutionize our\nhome. From this day forth there will be one person the less under my\nroof.\"\n\nCesarine looked at her father with an eye which seemed to say, \"What is\nthat to me?\"\n\n\"Popinot is going away.\"\n\nThough Cesar was a poor observer, and had, moreover, prepared his phrase\nas much to herald the creation of the house of A. Popinot and Company,\nas to set a trap for his daughter, yet his paternal tenderness made him\nguess the confused feelings which rose in Cesarine's heart, blossomed\nin roses on her cheek, suffused her forehead and even her eyes as she\nlowered them. Cesar thought that words must have passed between Cesarine\nand Popinot. He was mistaken; the two children comprehended each other,\nlike all timid lovers, without a word.\n\nSome moralists hold that love is an involuntary passion, the most\ndisinterested, the least calculating, of all the passions, except\nmaternal love. This opinion carries with it a vulgar error. Though the\nmajority of men may be ignorant of the causes of love, it is none\nthe less true that all sympathy, moral or physical, is based upon\ncalculations made either by the mind, or by sentiment or brutality. Love\nis an essentially selfish passion. Self means deep calculation. To every\nmind which looks only at results, it will seem at first sight singular\nand unlikely that a beautiful girl like Cesarine should love a poor lame\nfellow with red hair. Yet this phenomenon is completely in harmony with\nthe arithmetic of middle-class sentiments. To explain it, would be\nto give the reason of marriages which are constantly looked upon with\nsurprise,--marriages between tall and beautiful women and puny men, or\nbetween ugly little creatures and handsome men. Every man who is\ncursed with some bodily infirmity, no matter what it is,--club-feet, a\nhalting-gait, a humped-back, excessive ugliness, claret stains upon the\ncheek, Roguin's species of deformity, and other monstrosities the result\nof causes beyond the control of the sufferer,--has but two courses open\nto him: either he must make himself feared, or he must practise the\nvirtues of exquisite loving-kindness; he is not permitted to float in\nthe middle currents of average conduct which are habitual to other men.\nIf he takes the first course he probably has talent, genius, or strength\nof will; a man inspires terror only by the power of evil, respect by\ngenius, fear through force of mind. If he chooses the second course, he\nmakes himself adored; he submits to feminine tyranny, and knows better\nhow to love than men of irreproachable bodily condition.\n\nAnselme, brought up by virtuous people, by the Ragons, models of the\nhonorable bourgeoisie, and by his uncle the judge, had been led, through\nhis ingenuous nature and his deep religious sentiments, to redeem the\nslight deformity of his person by the perfection of his character.\nConstance and Cesar, struck by these tendencies, so attractive in youth,\nhad repeatedly sung his praises before Cesarine. Petty as they might be\nin many ways, husband and wife were noble by nature, and understood the\ndeep things of the heart. Their praises found an echo in the mind of the\nyoung girl, who, despite her innocence, had read in Anselme's pure eyes\nthe violent feeling, which is always flattering whatever be the lover's\nage, or rank, or personal appearance. Little Popinot had far more\nreason to adore a woman than a handsome man could ever have. If she were\nbeautiful, he would love her madly to her dying day; his fondness would\ninspire him with ambition; he would sacrifice his own life that his\nwife's might be happy; he would make her mistress of their home, and\nbe himself the first to accept her sway. Thus thought Cesarine,\ninvoluntarily perhaps, yet not altogether crudely; she gave a bird's-eye\nglance at the harvest of love in her own home, and reasoned by\ninduction; the happiness of her mother was before her eyes,--she wished\nfor no better fate; her instinct told her that Anselme was another\nCesar, improved by his education, as she had been improved by hers. She\ndreamed of Popinot as mayor of an arrondissement, and liked to picture\nherself taking up the collections in their parish church as her mother\ndid at Saint-Roch. She had reached the point of no longer perceiving the\ndifference between the left leg and the right leg of her lover, and\nwas even capable of saying, in all sincerity, \"Does he limp?\" She loved\nthose liquid eyes, and liked to watch the effect her own glance had\nupon them, as they lighted up for a moment with a chaste flame, and then\nfell, sadly.\n\nRoguin's head-clerk, Alexandre Crottat, who was gifted with the\nprecocious experience which comes from knowledge acquired in a lawyer's\noffice, had an air and manner that was half cynical, half silly, which\nrevolted Cesarine, already disgusted by the trite and commonplace\ncharacter of his conversation. The silence of Popinot, on the other\nhand, revealed his gentle nature; she loved the smile, partly mournful,\nwith which he listened to trivial vulgarities. The silly nonsense which\nmade him smile filled her with repulsion; they were grave or gay\nin sympathy. This hidden vantage-ground did not hinder Anselme from\nplunging into his work, and his indefatigable ardor in it pleased\nCesarine, for she guessed that when his comrades in the shop said,\n\"Mademoiselle Cesarine will marry Roguin's head-clerk,\" the poor lame\nAnselme, with his red hair, did not despair of winning her himself. A\nhigh hope is the proof of a great love.\n\n\"Where is he going?\" asked Cesarine of her father, trying to appear\nindifferent.\n\n\"He is to set up for himself in the Rue des Cinq-Diamants; and, my\nfaith! by the grace of God!\" cried Cesar, whose exclamations were not\nunderstood by his wife, nor by his daughter.\n\nWhen Birotteau encountered a moral difficulty he did as the insects do\nwhen there is an obstacle in their way,--he turned either to the right\nor to the left. He therefore changed the conversation, resolving to talk\nover Cesarine with his wife.\n\n\"I told all your fears and fancies about Roguin to your uncle, and he\nlaughed,\" he said to Constance.\n\n\"You should never tell what we say to each other!\" cried Constance.\n\"That poor Roguin may be the best man in the world; he is fifty-eight\nyears old, and perhaps he thinks no longer of--\"\n\nShe stopped short, seeing that Cesarine was listening attentively, and\nmade a sign to Cesar.\n\n\"Then I have done right to agree to the affair,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"You are the master,\" she answered.\n\nCesar took his wife by the hands and kissed her brow; that answer always\nconveyed her tacit assent to her husband's projects.\n\n\"Now, then,\" cried the perfumer, to his clerks, when he went back to\nthem, \"the shop will be closed at ten o'clock. Gentlemen, lend a hand!\na great feat! We must move, during the night, all the furniture from the\nfirst floor to the second floor. We shall have, as they say, to put the\nlittle pots in the big pots, for my architect must have his elbows\nfree to-morrow morning--Popinot has gone out without my permission,\" he\ncried, looking round and not seeing his cashier. \"Ah, true, he does not\nsleep here any more, I forget that. He is gone,\" thought Cesar, \"either\nto write down Monsieur Vauquelin's ideas, or else to hire the shop.\"\n\n\"We all know the cause of this household change,\" said Celestin,\nspeaking in behalf of the two other clerks and Raguet, grouped behind\nhim. \"Is it allowable to congratulate monsieur upon an honor which\nreflects its light upon the whole establishment? Popinot has told us\nthat monsieur--\"\n\n\"Hey, hey! my children, it is all true. I have been decorated. I am\nabout to assemble my friends, not only to celebrate the emancipation\nof our territory, but to commemorate my promotion to the order of the\nLegion of honor. I may, possibly, have shown myself worthy of that\nsignal and royal favor by my services on the Bench of commerce, and by\nfighting for the royal cause; which I defended--at your age--upon the\nsteps of Saint-Roch on the 13th Vendemiaire, and I give you my word that\nNapoleon, called emperor, wounded me himself! wounded me in the thigh;\nand Madame Ragon nursed me. Take courage! recompense comes to every man.\nBehold, my sons! misfortunes are never wasted.\"\n\n\"They will never fight in the streets again,\" said Celestin.\n\n\"Let us hope so,\" said Cesar, who thereupon went off into an harangue to\nthe clerks, which he wound up by inviting them to the ball.\n\nThe vision of a ball inspired the three clerks, Raguet, and Virginie the\ncook with an ardor that gave them the strength of acrobats. They came\nand went up and down the stairs, carrying everything and breaking\nnothing. By two o'clock in the morning the removal was effected. Cesar\nand his wife slept on the second floor. Popinot's bedroom became that\nof Celestin and the second clerk. On the third floor the furniture was\nstored provisionally.\n\nIn the grasp of that magnetic ardor, produced by an influx of the\nnervous fluid, which lights a brazier in the midriff of ambitious men\nand lovers intent on high emprise, Popinot, so gentle and tranquil\nusually, pawed the earth like a thoroughbred before the race, when he\ncame down into the shop after dinner.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" asked Celestin.\n\n\"Oh, what a day! my dear fellow, what a day! I am set up in business,\nand Monsieur Cesar is decorated.\"\n\n\"You are very lucky if the master helps you,\" said Celestin.\n\nPopinot did not answer; he disappeared, driven by a furious wind,--the\nwind of success.\n\n\"Lucky!\" said one of the clerks, who was sorting gloves by the dozen, to\nanother who was comparing prices on the tickets. \"Lucky! the master has\nfound out that Popinot is making eyes at Mademoiselle Cesarine, and,\nas the old fellow is pretty clever, he gets rid of Anselme; it would\nbe difficult to refuse him point-blank, on account of his relations.\nCelestin thinks the trick is luck or generosity!\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nAnselme Popinot went down the Rue Saint-Honore and rushed along the\nRue des Deux-Ecus to seize upon a young man whom his commercial\n_second-sight_ pointed out to him as the principal instrument of his\nfuture fortune. Popinot the judge had once done a great service to\nthe cleverest of all commercial travellers, to him whose triumphant\nloquacity and activity were to win him, in coming years, the title\nof The Illustrious. Devoted especially to the hat-trade and the\n_article-Paris_, this prince of travellers was called, at the time of\nwhich we write, purely and simply, Gaudissart. At the age of twenty-two\nhe was already famous by the power of his commercial magnetism. In those\ndays he was slim, with a joyous eye, expressive face, unwearied memory,\nand a glance that guessed the wants of every one; and he deserved to\nbe, what in fact he became, the king of commercial travellers,\nthe _Frenchman par excellence_. A few days earlier Popinot had met\nGaudissart, who mentioned that he was on the point of departure; the\nhope of finding him still in Paris sent the lover flying into the Rue\ndes Deux-Ecus, where he learned that the traveller had engaged his\nplace at the Messageries-Royales. To bid adieu to his beloved capital,\nGaudissart had gone to see a new piece at the Vaudeville; Popinot\nresolved to wait for him. Was it not drawing a cheque on fortune to\nentrust the launching of the oil of nuts to this incomparable steersman\nof mercantile inventions, already petted and courted by the richest\nfirms? Popinot had reason to feel sure of Gaudissart. The commercial\ntraveller, so knowing in the art of entangling that most wary of human\nbeings, the little provincial trader, had himself become entangled in\nthe first conspiracy attempted against the Bourbons after the\nHundred Days. Gaudissart, to whom the open firmament of heaven was\nindispensable, found himself shut up in prison, under the weight of an\naccusation for a capital offence. Popinot the judge, who presided at\nthe trial, released him on the ground that it was nothing worse than his\nimprudent folly which had mixed him up in the affair. A judge anxious\nto please the powers in office, or a rabid royalist, would have sent the\nluckless traveller to the scaffold. Gaudissart, who believed he owed\nhis life to the judge, cherished the grief of being unable to make his\nsavior any other return than that of sterile gratitude. As he could\nnot thank a judge for doing justice, he went to the Ragons and declared\nhimself liege-vassal forever to the house of Popinot.\n\nWhile waiting about for Gaudissart, Anselme naturally went to look at\nthe shop in the Rue des Cinq-Diamants, and got the address of the owner,\nfor the purpose of negotiating a lease. As he sauntered through the\ndusky labyrinth of the great market, thinking how to achieve a rapid\nsuccess, he suddenly came, in the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, upon a rare\nchance, and one of good omen, with which he resolved to regale Cesar on\nthe morrow. Soon after, while standing about the door of the Hotel du\nCommerce, at the end of the Rue des Deux-Ecus, about midnight, he heard,\nin the far distance of the Rue de Grenelle, a vaudeville chorus sung\nby Gaudissart, with a cane accompaniment significantly rapped upon the\npavement.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Anselme, suddenly appearing from the doorway, \"two\nwords?\"\n\n\"Eleven, if you like,\" said the commercial traveller, brandishing his\nloaded cane over the aggressor.\n\n\"I am Popinot,\" said poor Anselme.\n\n\"Enough!\" cried Gaudissart, recognizing him. \"What do you need?\nMoney?--absent, on leave, but we can get it. My arm for a duel?--all is\nyours, from my head to my heels,\" and he sang,--\n\n  \"Behold! behold!\n  A Frenchman true!\"\n\n\"Come and talk with me for ten minutes; not in your room,--we might be\noverheard,--but on the Quai de l'Horloge; there's no one there at this\nhour,\" said Popinot. \"It is about something important.\"\n\n\"Exciting, hey? Proceed.\"\n\nIn ten minutes Gaudissart, put in possession of Popinot's secret, saw\nits importance.\n\n  \"Come forth! perfumers, hair-dressers, petty retailers!\"\n\nsang Gaudissart, mimicking Lafon in the role of the Cid. \"I shall grab\nevery shopkeeper in France and Navarre.--Oh, an idea! I was about to\nstart; I remain; I shall take commissions from the Parisian perfumers.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To strangle your rivals, simpleton! If I take their orders I can make\ntheir perfidious cosmetics drink oil, simply by talking and working\nfor yours only. A first-rate traveller's trick! Ha! ha! we are the\ndiplomatists of commerce. Famous! As for your prospectus, I'll take\ncharge of that. I've got a friend--early childhood--Andoche Finot, son\nof the hat-maker in the Rue du Coq, the old buffer who launched me into\ntravelling on hats. Andoche, who has a great deal of wit,--he got it all\nout of the heads tiled by his father,--he is in literature; he does the\nminor theatres in the 'Courrier des Spectacles.' His father, an old\ndog chock-full of reasons for not liking wit, won't believe in it;\nimpossible to make him see that mind can be sold, sells itself in fact:\nhe won't believe in anything but the three-sixes. Old Finot manages\nyoung Finot by famine. Andoche, a capable man, no fool,--I don't consort\nwith fools, except commercially,--Andoche makes epigrams for the 'Fidele\nBerger,' which pays; while the other papers, for which he works like\na galley-slave, keep him down on his marrow-bones in the dust. Are not\nthey jealous, those fellows? Just the same in the _article-Paris_! Finot\nwrote a superb comedy in one act for Mademoiselle Mars, most glorious\nof the glorious!--ah, there's a woman I love!--Well, in order to get it\nplayed he had to take it to the Gaite. Andoche understands prospectuses,\nhe worms himself into the mercantile mind; and he's not proud, he'll\nconcoct it for us gratis. Damn it! with a bowl of punch and a few cakes\nwe'll get it out of him; for, Popinot, no nonsense! I am to travel on\nyour commission without pay: your competitors shall pay; I'll diddle\nit out of them. Let us understand each other clearly. As for me, this\ntriumph is an affair of honor. My reward is to be best man at your\nwedding! I shall go to Italy, Germany, England! I shall carry with me\nplacards in all languages, paste them everywhere, in villages, on doors\nof churches, all the best spots I can find in provincial towns! The oil\nshall sparkle, scintillate, glisten on every head. Ha! your marriage\nshall not be a sham; we'll make it a pageant, colors flying! You shall\nhave your Cesarine, or my name shall not be ILLUSTRIOUS,--that is what\nPere Finot calls me for having got off his gray hats. In selling your\noil I keep to my own sphere, the human head; hats and oil are well-known\npreservatives of the public hair.\"\n\nPopinot returned to his aunt's house, where he was to sleep, in such a\nfever, caused by his visions of success, that the streets seemed to\nhim to be running oil. He slept little, dreamed that his hair was madly\ngrowing, and saw two angels who unfolded, as they do in melodramas, a\nscroll on which was written \"Oil Cesarine.\" He woke, recollected the\ndream, and vowed to give the oil of nuts that sacred name, accepting the\nsleeping fancy as a celestial mandate.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nCesar and Popinot were at their work-shop in the Faubourg du Temple\nthe next morning long before the arrival of the nuts. While waiting for\nMadame Madou's porters, Popinot triumphantly recounted his treaty of\nalliance with Gaudissart.\n\n\"Have we indeed the illustrious Gaudissart? Then are we millionaires!\"\ncried the perfumer, extending his hand to his cashier with an air which\nLouis XIV. must have worn when he received the Marechal de Villars on\nhis return from Denain.\n\n\"We have something besides,\" said the happy clerk, producing from his\npocket a bottle of a squat shape, like a pumpkin, and ribbed on the\nsides. \"I have found ten thousand bottles like that, all made ready to\nhand, at four sous, and six months' credit.\"\n\n\"Anselme,\" said Birotteau, contemplating the wondrous shape of the\nflask, \"yesterday [here his tone of voice became solemn] in the\nTuileries,--yes, no later than yesterday,--you said to me, 'I will\nsucceed.' To-day I--I say to you, 'You will succeed.' Four sous! six\nmonths! an unparalleled shape! Macassar trembles to its foundations!\nWas I not right to seize upon the only nuts in Paris? Where did you find\nthese bottles?\"\n\n\"I was waiting to speak to Gaudissart, and sauntering--\"\n\n\"Just like me, when I found the Arab book,\" cried Birotteau.\n\n\"Coming down the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, I saw in a wholesale glass place,\nwhere they make blown glass and cases,--an immense place,--I caught\nsight of this flask; it blinded my eyes like a sudden light; a voice\ncried to me, 'Here's your chance!'\"\n\n\"Born merchant! he shall have my daughter!\" muttered Cesar.\n\n\"I went in; I saw thousands of these bottles packed in cases.\"\n\n\"You asked about them?\"\n\n\"Do you think me such a ninny?\" cried Anselme, in a grieved tone.\n\n\"Born merchant!\" repeated Birotteau.\n\n\"I asked for glass cases for the little wax Jesus; and while I was\nbargaining about them I found fault with the shape of the bottles. From\none thing to another, I trapped the man into admitting that Faille and\nBouchot, who lately failed, were starting a new cosmetic and wanted a\npeculiar style of bottle; he was doubtful about them and asked for\nhalf the money down. Faille and Bouchot, expecting to succeed, paid the\nmoney; they failed while the bottles were making. The assignees, when\ncalled upon to pay the bill, arranged to leave him the bottles and the\nmoney in hand, as an indemnity for the manufacture of articles thought\nto be ridiculous in shape, and quite unsalable. They cost originally\neight sous; he was glad to get rid of them for four; for, as he said,\nGod knows how long he might have on his hands a shape for which there\nwas no sale! 'Are you willing,' I said to him, 'to furnish ten thousand\nat four sous? If so, I may perhaps relieve you of them. I am a clerk at\nMonsieur Birotteau's.' I caught him, I led him, I mastered him, I worked\nhim up, and he is all ours.\"\n\n\"Four sous!\" said Birotteau. \"Do you know that we could use oil at three\nfrancs, and make a profit of thirty sous, and give twenty sous discount\nto retailers?\"\n\n\"Oil Cesarine!\" cried Popinot.\n\n\"Oil Cesarine?--Ah, lover! would you flatter both father and daughter?\nWell, well, so be it; Oil Cesarine! The Cesars owned the whole world.\nThey must have had fine hair.\"\n\n\"Cesar was bald,\" said Popinot.\n\n\"Because he never used our oil. Three francs for the Oil Cesarine,\nwhile Macassar Oil costs double! Gaudissart to the fore! We shall make\na hundred thousand francs this year, for we'll pour on every head that\nrespects itself a dozen bottles a year,--eighteen francs; say eighteen\nthousand heads,--one hundred and eighty thousand francs. We are\nmillionaires!\"\n\nThe nuts delivered, Raguet, the workmen, Popinot, and Cesar shelled a\nsufficient quantity, and before four o'clock they had produced several\npounds of oil. Popinot carried the product to show to Vauquelin, who\nmade him a present of a recipe for mixing the essence of nuts with other\nand less costly oleaginous substances, and scenting it. Popinot went to\nwork at once to take out a patent for the invention and all improvements\nthereon. The devoted Gaudissart lent him the money to pay the fees, for\nPopinot was ambitious to pay his share in the undertaking.\n\nProsperity brings with it an intoxication which inferior men are unable\nto resist. Cesar's exaltation of spirit had a result not difficult to\nforesee. Grindot came, and presented a colored sketch of a charming\ninterior view of the proposed appartement. Birotteau, seduced, agreed\nto everything; and soon the house, and the heart of Constance, began to\nquiver under the blows of pick and hammer. The house-painter, Monsieur\nLourdois, a very rich contractor, who had promised that nothing should\nbe wanting, talked of gilding the salon. On hearing that word Constance\ninterposed.\n\n\"Monsieur Lourdois,\" she said, \"you have an income of thirty thousand\nfrancs, you occupy your own house, and you can do what you like to it;\nbut the rest of us--\"\n\n\"Madame, commerce ought to shine and not permit itself to be kept in\nthe shade by the aristocracy. Besides, Monsieur Birotteau is in the\ngovernment; he is before the eyes of the world--\"\n\n\"Yes, but he still keeps a shop,\" said Constance, in the hearing of the\nclerks and the five persons who were listening to her. \"Neither he, nor\nI, nor his friends, nor his enemies will forget that.\"\n\nBirotteau rose upon the points of his toes and fell back upon his heels\nseveral times, his hands crossed behind him.\n\n\"My wife is right,\" he said; \"we should be modest in prosperity.\nMoreover, as long as a man is in business he should be careful of\nhis expenses, limited in his luxury; the law itself imposes the\nobligation,--he must not allow himself 'excessive expenditures.' If the\nenlargement of my home and its decoration were to go beyond due limits,\nit would be wrong in me to permit it; you yourself would blame me,\nLourdois. The neighborhood has its eye upon me; successful men incur\njealousy, envy. Ah! you will soon know that, young man,\" he said to\nGrindot; \"if we are calumniated, at least let us give no handle to the\ncalumny.\"\n\n\"Neither calumny nor evil-speaking can touch you,\" said Lourdois; \"your\nposition is unassailable. But your business habits are so strong that\nyou must argue over every enterprise; you are a deep one--\"\n\n\"True, I have some experience in business. You know, of course, why I\nmake this enlargement? If I insist on punctuality in the completion of\nthe work, it is--\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, my wife and I are about to assemble our friends, as much to\ncelebrate the emancipation of our territory as to commemorate my\npromotion to the order of the Legion of honor--\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" said Lourdois, \"have they given you the cross?\"\n\n\"Yes; I may possibly have shown myself worthy of that signal royal\nfavor by my services on the Bench of commerce, and by fighting for the\nBourbons upon the steps of Saint-Roch, on the 13th Vendemiaire, where\nI was wounded by Napoleon. Come to the ball, and bring your wife and\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Charmed with the honor you deign to pay me,\" said Lourdois (a liberal).\n\"But you are a deep one, Papa Birotteau; you want to make sure that I\nshall not break my word,--that's the reason you invite me. Well, I'll\nemploy my best workmen; we'll build the fires of hell and dry the paint.\nI must find some desiccating process; it would never do to dance in a\nfog from the wet plaster. We will varnish it to hide the smell.\"\n\nThree days later the commercial circles of the quarter were in a\nflutter at the announcement of Birotteau's ball. Everybody could see for\nthemselves the props and scaffoldings necessitated by the change of the\nstaircase, the square wooden funnels down which the rubbish was thrown\ninto the carts stationed in the street. The sight of men working by\ntorchlight--for there were day workmen and night workmen--arrested\nall the idlers and busybodies in the street; gossip, based on these\npreparations, proclaimed a sumptuous forthcoming event.\n\nOn Sunday, the day Cesar had appointed to conclude the affair of\nthe lands about the Madeleine, Monsieur and Madame Ragon, and uncle\nPillerault arrived about four o'clock, just after vespers. In view of\nthe demolition that was going on, so Cesar said, he could only invite\nCharles Claparon, Crottat, and Roguin. The notary brought with him the\n\"Journal des Debats\" in which Monsieur de la Billardiere had inserted\nthe following article:--\n\n  \"We learn that the deliverance of our territory will be feted with\n  enthusiasm throughout France. In Paris the members of the\n  municipal body feel that the time has come to restore the capital\n  to that accustomed splendor which under a becoming sense of\n  propriety was laid aside during the foreign occupation. The mayors\n  and deputy-mayors each propose to give a ball; this national\n  movement will no doubt be followed, and the winter promises to be\n  a brilliant one. Among the fetes now preparing, the one most\n  talked of is the ball of Monsieur Birotteau, lately named\n  chevalier of the Legion of honor and well-known for his devotion\n  to the royal cause. Monsieur Birotteau, wounded in the affair of\n  Saint-Roch, judges in the department of commerce, and therefore\n  has doubly merited this honor.\"\n\n\"How well they write nowadays,\" cried Cesar. \"They are talking about us\nin the papers,\" he said to Pillerault.\n\n\"Well, what of it?\" answered his uncle, who had a special antipathy to\nthe \"Journal des Debats.\"\n\n\"That article may help to sell the Paste of Sultans and the Carminative\nBalm,\" whispered Madame Cesar to Madame Ragon, not sharing the\nintoxication of her husband.\n\nMadame Ragon, a tall woman, dry and wrinkled, with a pinched nose and\nthin lips, bore a spurious resemblance to a marquise of the old court.\nThe circles round her eyes had spread to a wide circumference, like\nthose of elderly women who have known sorrow. The severe and dignified,\nalthough affable, expression of her countenance inspired respect. She\nhad, withal, a certain oddity about her, which excited notice, but\nnever ridicule; and this was exhibited in her dress and habits. She wore\nmittens, and carried in all weathers a cane sunshade, like that used\nby Queen Marie-Antoinette at Trianon; her gown (the favorite color\nwas pale-brown, the shade of dead leaves) fell from her hips in those\ninimitable folds the secret of which the dowagers of the olden time have\ncarried away with them. She retained the black mantilla trimmed with\nblack lace woven in large square meshes; her caps, old-fashioned in\nshape, had the quaint charm which we see in silhouettes relieved against\na white background. She took snuff with exquisite nicety and with\nthe gestures which young people of the present day who have had the\nhappiness of seeing their grandmothers and great-aunts replacing their\ngold snuff-boxes solemnly on the tables beside them, and shaking off the\ngrains which strayed upon their kerchiefs, will doubtless remember.\n\nThe Sieur Ragon was a little man, not over five feet high, with a face\nlike a nut-cracker, in which could be seen only two eyes, two sharp\ncheek-bones, a nose and a chin. Having no teeth he swallowed half\nhis words, though his style of conversation was effluent, gallant,\npretentious, and smiling, with the smile he formerly wore when he\nreceived beautiful great ladies at the door of his shop. Powder, well\nraked off, defined upon his cranium a nebulous half-circle, flanked by\ntwo pigeon-wings, divided by a little queue tied with a ribbon. He wore\na bottle-blue coat, a white waistcoat, small-clothes and silk stockings,\nshoes with gold buckles, and black silk gloves. The most marked feature\nof his behavior was his habit of going through the street holding his\nhat in his hand. He looked like a messenger of the Chamber of Peers, or\nan usher of the king's bedchamber, or any of those persons placed near\nto some form of power from which they get a reflected light, though of\nlittle account themselves.\n\n\"Well, Birotteau,\" he said, with a magisterial air, \"do you repent, my\nboy, for having listened to us in the old times? Did we ever doubt the\ngratitude of our beloved sovereigns?\"\n\n\"You have been very happy, dear child,\" said Madame Ragon to Madame\nBirotteau.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" answered Constance, always under the spell of the cane\nparasol, the butterfly cap, the tight sleeves, and the great kerchief _a\nla Julie_ which Madame Ragon wore.\n\n\"Cesarine is charming. Come here, my love,\" said Madame Ragon, in her\nshrill voice and patronizing manner.\n\n\"Shall we do the business before dinner?\" asked uncle Pillerault.\n\n\"We are waiting for Monsieur Claparon,\" said Roguin, \"I left him\ndressing himself.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Roguin,\" said Cesar, \"I hope you told him that we should dine\nin a wretched little room on the _entresol_--\"\n\n\"He thought it superb sixteen years ago,\" murmured Constance.\n\n\"--among workmen and rubbish.\"\n\n\"Bah! you will find him a good fellow, with no pretension,\" said Roguin.\n\n\"I have put Raguet on guard in the shop. We can't go through our own\ndoor; everything is pulled down.\"\n\n\"Why did you not bring your nephew?\" said Pillerault to Madame Ragon.\n\n\"Shall we not see him?\" asked Cesarine.\n\n\"No, my love,\" said Madame Ragon; \"Anselme, dear boy, is working himself\nto death. That bad-smelling Rue des Cinq-Diamants, without sun and\nwithout air, frightens me. The gutter is always blue or green or black.\nI am afraid he will die of it. But when a young man has something in his\nhead--\" and she looked at Cesarine with a gesture which explained that\nthe word head meant heart.\n\n\"Has he got his lease?\" asked Cesar.\n\n\"Yesterday, before a notary,\" replied Ragon. \"He took the place for\neighteen years, but they exacted six months' rent in advance.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Ragon, are you satisfied with me?\" said the perfumer. \"I\nhave given him the secret of a great discovery--\"\n\n\"We know you by heart, Cesar,\" said little Ragon, taking Cesar's hands\nand pressing them with religious friendship.\n\nRoguin was not without anxiety as to Claparon's entrance on the scene;\nfor his tone and manners were quite likely to alarm these virtuous and\nworthy people; he therefore thought it advisable to prepare their minds.\n\n\"You are going to see,\" he said to Pillerault and the two ladies, \"a\nthorough original, who hides his methods under a fearfully bad style\nof manners; from a very inferior position he has raised himself up by\nintelligence. He will acquire better manners through his intercourse\nwith bankers. You may see him on the boulevard, or on a cafe tippling,\ndisorderly, betting at billiards, and think him a mere idler; but he is\nnot; he is thinking and studying all the time to keep industry alive by\nnew projects.\"\n\n\"I understand that,\" said Birotteau; \"I got my great ideas when\nsauntering on the boulevard; didn't I, Mimi?\"\n\n\"Claparon,\" resumed Roguin, \"makes up by night-work the time lost in\nlooking about him in the daytime, and watching the current of affairs.\nAll men of great talent lead curious lives, inexplicable lives; well, in\nspite of his desultory ways he attains his object, as I can testify. In\nthis instance he has managed to make the owners of these lands give way:\nthey were unwilling, doubtful, timid; he fooled them all, tired them\nout, went to see them every day,--and here we are, virtually masters of\nthe property.\"\n\nAt this moment a curious _broum! broum!_ peculiar to tipplers of brandy\nand other liquors, announced the arrival of the most fantastic personage\nof our story, and the arbiter in flesh and blood of the future destinies\nof Cesar Birotteau. The perfumer rushed headlong to the little dark\nstaircase, as much to tell Raguet to close the shop as to pour out his\nexcuses to Claparon for receiving him in the dining-room.\n\n\"What of that? It's the very place to juggle a--I mean to settle a piece\nof business.\"\n\nIn spite of Roguin's clever precautions, Monsieur and Madame Ragon,\npeople of old-fashioned middle-class breeding, the observer Pillerault,\nCesarine, and her mother were disagreeably impressed at first sight by\nthis sham banker of high finance.\n\nAbout twenty-eight years of age at the time of which we write, the late\ncommercial traveller possessed not a hair on his head, and wore a\nwig curled in ringlets. This head-gear needed, by rights, a virgin\nfreshness, a lacteal purity of complexion, and all the softer\ncorresponding graces: as it was, however, it threw into ignoble relief a\npimpled face, brownish-red in color, inflamed like that of the conductor\nof a diligence, and seamed with premature wrinkles, which betrayed in\nthe puckers of their deep-cut lines a licentious life, whose misdeeds\nwere still further evidenced by the badness of the man's teeth, and the\nblack speckles which appeared here and there on his corrugated skin.\nClaparon had the air of a provincial comedian who knows all the roles,\nand plays the clown with a wink; his cheeks, where the rouge never\nstuck, were jaded by excesses, his lips clammy, though his tongue\nwas forever wagging, especially when he was drunk; his glances were\nimmodest, and his gestures compromising. Such a face, flushed with the\njovial features of punch, was enough to turn grave business matters\ninto a farce; so that the embryo banker had been forced to put himself\nthrough a long course of mimicry before he managed to acquire even the\nsemblance of a manner that accorded with his fictitious importance.\n\nDu Tillet assisted in dressing him for this occasion, like the manager\nof a theatre who is uneasy about the debut of his principal actor; he\nfeared lest the vulgar habits of this devil-may-care life should crop up\nto the surface of the newly-fledged banker. \"Talk as little as you can,\"\nhe said to him. \"No banker ever gabbles; he acts, thinks, reflects,\nlistens, weighs. To seem like a banker you must say nothing, or, at any\nrate, mere nothings. Check that ribald eye of yours, and look serious,\neven if you have to look stupid. If you talk politics, go for the\ngovernment, but keep to generalities. For instance: 'The budget is\nheavy'; 'No compromise is possible between the parties'; 'The Liberals\nare dangerous'; 'The Bourbons must avoid a conflict'; 'Liberalism is\nthe cloak of a coalition'; 'The Bourbons are inaugurating an era of\nprosperity: let us sustain them, even if we do not like them'; 'France\nhas had enough of politics,' etc. Don't gorge yourself at every\ntable where you dine; recollect you are to maintain the dignity of a\nmillionaire. Don't shovel in your snuff like an old Invalide; toy with\nyour snuff-box, glance often at your feet, and sometimes at the ceiling,\nbefore you answer; try to look sagacious, if you can. Above all, get rid\nof your vile habit of touching everything; in society a banker ought to\nseem tired of seeing and touching things. Hang it! you are supposed to\nbe passing wakeful nights; finance makes you brusque, so many elements\nmust be brought together to launch an enterprise,--so much study!\nRemember to take gloomy views of business; it is heavy, dull, risky,\nunsettled. Now, don't go beyond that, and mind you specify nothing.\nDon't sing those songs of Beranger at table; and don't get fuddled. If\nyou are drunk, your future is lost. Roguin will keep an eye on you. You\nare going now among moral people, virtuous people; and you are not to\nscare them with any of your pot-house principles.\"\n\nThis lecture produced upon the mind of Charles Claparon very much\nthe effect that his new clothes produced upon his body. The jovial\nscapegrace, easy-going with all the world, and long used to a\ncomfortable shabbiness, in which his body was no more shackled than his\nmind was shackled by language, was now encased in the new clothes his\ntailor had just sent home, rigid as a picket-stake, anxious about his\nmotions as well as about his speech; drawing back his hand when it was\nimprudently thrust out to grasp a bottle, just as he stopped his tongue\nin the middle of a sentence. All this presented a laughable discrepancy\nto the keen observation of Pillerault. Claparon's red face, and his wig\nwith its profligate ringlets, gave the lie to his apparel and pretended\nbearing, just as his thoughts clashed and jangled with his speech.\nBut these worthy people ended by crediting such discordances to the\npreoccupation of his busy mind.\n\n\"He is so full of business,\" said Roguin.\n\n\"Business has given him little education,\" whispered Madame Ragon to\nCesarine.\n\nMonsieur Roguin overheard her, and put a finger on his lips:--\n\n\"He is rich, clever, and extremely honorable,\" he said, stooping to\nMadame Ragon's ear.\n\n\"Something may be forgiven in consideration of such qualities,\" said\nPillerault to Ragon.\n\n\"Let us read the deeds before dinner,\" said Roguin; \"we are all alone.\"\n\nMadame Ragon, Cesarine, and Constance left the contracting parties\nto listen to the deeds read over to them by Alexandre Crottat. Cesar\nsigned, in favor of one of Roguin's clients, a mortgage bond for forty\nthousand francs, on his grounds and manufactories in the Faubourg du\nTemple; he turned over to Roguin Pillerault's cheque on the Bank of\nFrance, and gave, without receipt, bills for twenty thousand francs from\nhis current funds, and notes for one hundred and forty thousand francs\npayable to the order of Claparon.\n\n\"I have no receipt to give you,\" said Claparon; \"you deal, for your half\nof the property, with Monsieur Roguin, as I do for ours. The sellers\nwill get their pay from him in cash; all that I engage to do is to see\nthat you get the equivalent of the hundred and forty thousand francs\npaid to my order.\"\n\n\"That is equitable,\" said Pillerault.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, let us call in the ladies; it is cold without them,\"\nsaid Claparon, glancing at Roguin, as if to ask whether that jest were\ntoo broad.\n\n\"Ladies! Ah! mademoiselle is doubtless yours,\" said Claparon, holding\nhimself very straight and looking at Birotteau; \"hey! you are not a\nbungler. None of the roses you distil can be compared with her; and\nperhaps it is because you have distilled roses that--\"\n\n\"Faith!\" said Roguin, interrupting him, \"I am very hungry.\"\n\n\"Let us go to dinner,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"We shall dine before a notary,\" said Claparon, catching himself up.\n\n\"You do a great deal of business?\" said Pillerault, seating himself\nintentionally next to Claparon.\n\n\"Quantities; by the gross,\" answered the banker. \"But it is all heavy,\ndull; there are risks, canals. Oh, canals! you have no idea how canals\noccupy us; it is easy to explain. Government needs canals. Canals are\na want especially felt in the departments; they concern commerce,\nyou know. 'Rivers,' said Pascal, 'are walking markets.' We must\nhave markets. Markets depend on embankments, tremendous earth-works;\nearth-works employ the laboring-classes; hence loans, which find\ntheir way back, in the end, to the pockets of the poor. Voltaire said,\n'Canaux, canards, canaille!' But the government has its own engineers;\nyou can't get a finger in the matter unless you get on the right side of\nthem; for the Chamber,--oh, monsieur, the Chamber does us all the harm\nin the world! It won't take in the political question hidden under the\nfinancial question. There's bad faith on one side or the other. Would\nyou believe it? there's Keller in the Chamber: now Francois Keller is an\norator, he attacks the government about the budget, about canals. Well,\nwhen he gets home to the bank, and we go to him with proposals, canals,\nand so forth, the sly dog is all the other way: everything is right;\nwe must arrange it with the government which he has just been been\nimpudently attacking. The interests of the orator and the interests of\nthe banker clash; we are between two fires! Now, you understand how it\nis that business is risky; we have got to please everybody,--clerks,\nchambers, antechambers, ministers--\"\n\n\"Ministers?\" said Pillerault, determined to get to the bottom of this\nco-associate.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, ministers.\"\n\n\"Well, then the newspapers are right?\" said Pillerault.\n\n\"There's my uncle talking politics,\" said Birotteau. \"Monsieur Claparon\nhas won his heart.\"\n\n\"Devilish rogues, the newspapers,\" said Claparon. \"Monsieur, the\nnewspapers do all the mischief. They are useful sometimes, but they\nkeep me awake many a night. I wish they didn't. I have put my eyes out\nreading and ciphering.\"\n\n\"To go back to the ministers,\" said Pillerault, hoping for revelations.\n\n\"Ministers are a mere necessity of government. Ah! what am I eating?\nambrosia?\" said Claparon, breaking off. \"This is a sauce you'll never\nfind except at a tradesman's table, for the pot-houses--\"\n\nHere the flowers in Madame Ragon's cap skipped like young rams. Claparon\nperceived the word was low, and tried to catch himself up.\n\n\"In bank circles,\" he said, \"we call the best cafes.--Very, and the\nFreres Provencaux,--pot-houses in jest. Well, neither those infamous\npot-houses nor our most scientific cooks can make us a sauce like this;\nmellifluous! Some give you clear water soured with lemon, and the rest\ndrugs, chemicals.\"\n\nPillerault tried throughout the dinner to fathom this extraordinary\nbeing; finding only a void, he began to think him dangerous.\n\n\"All's well,\" whispered Roguin to Claparon.\n\n\"I shall get out of these clothes to-night, at any rate,\" answered\nClaparon, who was choking.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Cesar, addressing him, \"we are compelled to dine in\nthis little room because we are preparing, eighteen days hence, to\nassemble our friends, as much to celebrate the emancipation of our\nterritory--\"\n\n\"Right, monsieur; I myself am for the government. I belong, in opinion,\nto the _statu quo_ of the great man who guides the destinies of the\nhouse of Austria, jolly dog! Hold fast that you may acquire; and, above\nall, acquire that you may hold. Those are my opinions, which I have the\nhonor to share with Prince Metternich.\"\n\n\"--as to commemorate my promotion to the order of the Legion of honor,\"\ncontinued Cesar.\n\n\"Yes, I know. Who told me of that,--the Kellers, or Nucingen?\"\n\nRoguin, surprised at such tact, made an admiring gesture.\n\n\"No, no; it was in the Chamber.\"\n\n\"In the Chamber? was it Monsieur de la Billardiere?\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"He is charming,\" whispered Cesar to his uncle.\n\n\"He pours out phrases, phrases, phrases,\" said Pillerault, \"enough to\ndrown you.\"\n\n\"Possibly I showed myself worthy of this signal, royal favor,--\" resumed\nBirotteau.\n\n\"By your labors in perfumery; the Bourbons know how to reward all merit.\nAh! let us support those generous princes, to whom we are about to owe\nunheard-of prosperity. Believe me, the Restoration feels that it must\nrun a tilt against the Empire; the Bourbons have conquests to make, the\nconquests of peace. You will see their conquests!\"\n\n\"Monsieur will perhaps do us the honor to be present at our ball?\" said\nMadame Cesar.\n\n\"To pass an evening with you, Madame, I would sacrifice the making of\nmillions.\"\n\n\"He certainly does chatter,\" said Cesar to his uncle.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nWhile the declining glory of perfumery was about to send forth its\nsetting rays, a star was rising with feeble light upon the commercial\nhorizon. Anselme Popinot was laying the corner-stone of his fortune\nin the Rue des Cinq-Diamants. This narrow little street, where loaded\nwagons can scarcely pass each other, runs from the Rue des Lombards at\none end, to the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher at the other, entering the latter\nopposite to the Rue Quincampoix, that famous thoroughfare of old\nParis where French history has so often been enacted. In spite of this\ndisadvantage, the congregation of druggists in that neighborhood made\nPopinot's choice of the little street a good one. The house, which\nstands second from the Rue des Lombards, was so dark that except at\ncertain seasons it was necessary to use lights in open day. The embryo\nmerchant had taken possession, the preceding evening, of the dingy\nand disgusting premises. His predecessor, who sold molasses and coarse\nsugars, had left the stains of his dirty business upon the walls, in the\ncourt, in the store-rooms. Imagine a large and spacious shop, with great\niron-bound doors, painted a dragon-green, strengthened with long iron\nbars held on by nails whose heads looked like mushrooms, and covered\nwith an iron trellis-work, which swelled out at the bottom after the\nfashion of the bakers'-shops in former days; the floor paved with large\nwhite stones, most of them broken, the walls yellow, and as bare as\nthose of a guard-room. Next to the shop came the back-shop, and two\nother rooms lighted from the street, in which Popinot proposed to put\nhis office, his books, and his own workroom. Above these rooms were\nthree narrow little chambers pushed up against the party-wall, with an\noutlook into the court; here he intended to dwell. The three rooms were\ndilapidated, and had no view but that of the court, which was dark,\nirregular, and surrounded by high walls, to which perpetual dampness,\neven in dry weather, gave the look of being daubed with fresh plaster.\nBetween the stones of this court was a filthy and stinking black\nsubstance, left by the sugars and the molasses that once occupied it.\nOnly one of the bedrooms had a chimney, all the walls were without\npaper, and the floors were tiled with brick.\n\nSince early morning Gaudissart and Popinot, helped by a journeyman whose\nservices the commercial traveller had invoked, were busily employed in\nstretching a fifteen-sous paper on the walls of these horrible rooms,\nthe workman pasting the lengths. A collegian's mattress on a bedstead of\nred wood, a shabby night-stand, an old-fashioned bureau, one table, two\narmchairs, and six common chairs, the gift of Popinot's uncle the judge,\nmade up the furniture. Gaudissart had decked the chimney-piece with\na frame in which was a mirror much defaced, and bought at a bargain.\nTowards eight o'clock in the evening the two friends, seated before the\nfireplace where a fagot of wood was blazing, were about to attack the\nremains of their breakfast.\n\n\"Down with the cold mutton!\" cried Gaudissart, suddenly, \"it is not\nworthy of such a housewarming.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Popinot, showing his solitary coin of twenty francs, which\nhe was keeping to pay for the prospectus, \"I--\"\n\n\"I--\" cried Gaudissart, sticking a forty-franc piece in his own eye.\n\nA knock resounded throughout the court, naturally empty and echoing of\na Sunday, when the workpeople were away from it and the laboratories\nempty.\n\n\"Here comes the faithful slave of the Rue de la Poterie!\" cried the\nillustrious Gaudissart.\n\nSure enough, a waiter entered, followed by two scullions bearing\nin three baskets a dinner, and six bottles of wine selected with\ndiscernment.\n\n\"How shall we ever eat it all up?\" said Popinot.\n\n\"The man of letters!\" cried Gaudissart, \"don't forget him. Finot loves\nthe pomps and the vanities; he is coming, the innocent boy, armed with\na dishevelled prospectus--the word is pat, hein? Prospectuses are always\nthirsty. We must water the seed if we want flowers. Depart, slaves!\" he\nadded, with a gorgeous air, \"there is gold for you.\"\n\nHe gave them ten sous with a gesture worthy of Napoleon, his idol.\n\n\"Thank you, Monsieur Gaudissart,\" said the scullions, better pleased\nwith the jest than with the money.\n\n\"As for you, my son,\" he said to the waiter, who stayed to serve\nthe dinner, \"below is a porter's wife; she lives in a lair where she\nsometimes cooks, as in other days Nausicaa washed, for pure amusement.\nFind her, implore her goodness; interest her, young man, in the\nwarmth of these dishes. Tell her she shall be blessed, and above all,\nrespected, most respected, by Felix Gaudissart, son of Jean-Francois\nGaudissart, grandson of all the Gaudissarts, vile proletaries of ancient\nbirth, his forefathers. March! and mind that everything is hot, or I'll\ndeal retributive justice by a rap on your knuckles!\"\n\nAnother knock sounded.\n\n\"Here comes the pungent Andoche!\" shouted Gaudissart.\n\nA stout, chubby-faced fellow of medium height, from head to foot the\nevident son of a hat-maker, with round features whose shrewdness was\nhidden under a restrained and subdued manner, suddenly appeared. His\nface, which was melancholy, like that of a man weary of poverty, lighted\nup hilariously when he caught sight of the table, and the bottles\nswathed in significant napkins. At Gaudissart's shout, his pale-blue\neyes sparkled, his big head, hollowed like that of a Kalmuc Tartar,\nbobbed from right to left, and he bowed to Popinot with a queer manner,\nwhich meant neither servility nor respect, but was rather that of a man\nwho feels he is not in his right place and will make no concessions.\nHe was just beginning to find out that he possessed no literary talent\nwhatever; he meant to stay in the profession, however, by living on the\nbrains of others, and getting astride the shoulders of those more able\nthan himself, making his profit there instead of struggling any longer\nat his own ill-paid work. At the present moment he had drunk to the\ndregs the humiliation of applications and appeals which constantly\nfailed, and he was now, like people in the higher walks of finance,\nabout to change his tone and become insolent, advisedly. But he needed a\nsmall sum in hand on which to start, and Gaudissart gave him a share in\nthe present affair of ushering into the world the oil of Popinot.\n\n\"You are to negotiate on his account with the newspapers. But don't\nplay double; if you do I'll fight you to the death. Give him his money's\nworth.\"\n\nPopinot gazed at \"the author\" which much uneasiness. People who are\npurely commercial look upon an author with mingled sentiments of fear,\ncompassion, and curiosity. Though Popinot had been well brought up, the\nhabits of his relations, their ideas, and the obfuscating effect of a\nshop and a counting-room, had lowered his intelligence by bending it to\nthe use and wont of his calling,--a phenomenon which may often be\nseen if we observe the transformations which take place in a hundred\ncomrades, when ten years supervene between the time when they leave\ncollege or a public school, to all intents and purposes alike, and\nthe period when they meet again after contact with the world. Andoche\naccepted Popinot's perturbation as a compliment.\n\n\"Now then, before dinner, let's get to the bottom of the prospectus;\nthen we can drink without an afterthought,\" said Gaudissart. \"After\ndinner one reads askew; the tongue digests.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Popinot, \"a prospectus is often a fortune.\"\n\n\"And for plebeians like myself,\" said Andoche, \"fortune is nothing more\nthan a prospectus.\"\n\n\"Ha, very good!\" cried Gaudissart, \"that rogue of a Finot has the wit of\nthe forty Academicians.\"\n\n\"Of a hundred Academicians,\" said Popinot, bewildered by these ideas.\n\nThe impatient Gaudissart seized the manuscript and began to read in a\nloud voice, with much emphasis, \"CEPHALIC OIL.\"\n\n\"I should prefer _Oil Cesarienne_,\" said Popinot.\n\n\"My friend,\" said Gaudissart, \"you don't know the provincials; there's\na surgical operation called by that name, and they are such stupids that\nthey'll think your oil is meant to facilitate childbirth. To drag them\nback from that to hair is beyond even my powers of persuasion.\"\n\n\"Without wishing to defend my term,\" said the author, \"I must ask you\nto observe that 'Cephalic Oil' means oil for the head, and sums up your\nideas in one word.\"\n\n\"Well, let us see,\" said Popinot impatiently.\n\nHere follows the prospectus; the same which the trade receives, by the\nthousand, to the present day (another _piece justificative_):--\n\n\n                              GOLD MEDAL\n                          EXPOSITION OF 1819\n\n                             CEPHALIC OIL\n\n\n               Patents for Invention and Improvements.\n\n  \"No cosmetic can make the hair grow, and no chemical preparation\n  can dye it without peril to the seat of intelligence. Science has\n  recently made known the fact that hair is a dead substance, and\n  that no agent can prevent it from falling off or whitening. To\n  prevent Baldness and Dandruff, it is necessary to protect the bulb\n  from which the hair issues from all deteriorating atmospheric\n  influences, and to maintain the temperature of the head at its\n  right medium. CEPHALIC OIL, based upon principles laid down by the\n  Academy of Sciences, produces this important result, sought by the\n  ancients,--the Greeks, the Romans, and all Northern nations,--to\n  whom the preservation of the hair was peculiarly precious. Certain\n  scientific researches have demonstrated that nobles, formerly\n  distinguished for the length of their hair, used no other remedy\n  than this; their method of preparation, which had been lost in the\n  lapse of ages, has been intelligently re-discovered by A. Popinot,\n  the inventor of CEPHALIC OIL.\n\n  \"To _preserve_, rather than provoke a useless and injurious\n  stimulation of the instrument which contains the bulbs, is the\n  mission of CEPHALIC OIL. In short, this oil, which counteracts the\n  exfoliation of pellicular atoms, which exhales a soothing perfume,\n  and arrests, by means of the substances of which it is composed\n  (among them more especially the oil of nuts), the action of the\n  outer air upon the scalp, also prevents influenzas, colds in the\n  head, and other painful cephalic afflictions, by maintaining the\n  normal temperature of the cranium. Consequently, the bulbs, which\n  contain the generating fluids, are neither chilled by cold nor\n  parched by heat. The hair of the head, that magnificent product,\n  priceless alike to man and woman, will be preserved even to\n  advanced age, in all the brilliancy and lustre which bestow their\n  charm upon the heads of infancy, by those who make use of CEPHALIC\n  OIL.\n\n  \"DIRECTIONS FOR USE are furnished with each bottle, and serve as a\n  wrapper.\n\n  \"METHOD OF USING CEPHALIC OIL.--It is quite useless to oil the\n  hair; this is not only a vulgar and foolish prejudice, but an\n  untidy habit, for the reason that all cosmetics leave their trace.\n  It suffices to wet a little sponge in the oil, and after parting\n  the hair with the comb, to apply it at the roots in such a manner\n  that the whole skin of the head may be enabled to imbibe it, after\n  the scalp has received a preliminary cleansing with brush and\n  comb.\n\n  \"The oil is sold in bottles bearing the signature of the inventor,\n  to prevent counterfeits. Price, THREE FRANCS. A. POPINOT, Rue des\n  Cinq-Diamants, quartier des Lombards, Paris.\n\n  \"_It is requested that all letters be prepaid._\n\n  \"N.B. The house of A. Popinot supplies all oils and essences\n  appertaining to druggists: lavender, oil of almonds, sweet and\n  bitter, orange oil, cocoa-nut oil, castor oil, and others.\"\n\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said the illustrious Gaudissart to Finot, \"it is\nadmirably written. Thunder and lightning! we are in the upper regions\nof science. We shirk nothing; we go straight to the point. That's useful\nliterature; I congratulate you.\"\n\n\"A noble prospectus!\" cried Popinot, enthusiastically.\n\n\"A prospectus which slays Macassar at the first word,\" continued\nGaudissart, rising with a magisterial air to deliver the following\nspeech, which he divided by gestures and pauses in his most\nparliamentary manner.\n\n\"No--hair--can be made--to grow! Hair cannot be dyed without--danger!\nHa! ha! success is there. Modern science is in union with the customs\nof the ancients. We can deal with young and old alike. We can say to\nthe old man, 'Ha, monsieur! the ancients, the Greeks and Romans, knew a\nthing or two, and were not so stupid as some would have us believe'; and\nwe can say to the young man, 'My dear boy, here's another discovery\ndue to progress and the lights of science. We advance; what may we not\nobtain from steam and telegraphy, and other things! This oil is based\non the scientific treatise of Monsieur Vauquelin!' Suppose we print an\nextract from Monsieur Vauquelin's report to the Academy of Sciences,\nconfirming our statement, hein? Famous! Come, Finot, sit down; attack\nthe viands! Soak up the champagne! let us drink to the success of my\nyoung friend, here present!\"\n\n\"I felt,\" said the author modestly, \"that the epoch of flimsy and\nfrivolous prospectuses had gone by; we are entering upon an era of\nscience; we need an academical tone,--a tone of authority, which imposes\nupon the public.\"\n\n\"We'll boil that oil; my feet itch, and my tongue too. I've got\ncommissions from all the rival hair people; none of them give more\nthan thirty per cent discount; we must manage forty on every hundred\nremitted, and I'll answer for a hundred thousand bottles in six months.\nI'll attack apothecaries, grocers, perfumers! Give 'em forty per cent,\nand they'll bamboozle the public.\"\n\nThe three young fellows devoured their dinner like lions, and drank like\nlords to the future success of Cephalic Oil.\n\n\"The oil is getting into my head,\" said Finot.\n\nGaudissart poured out a series of jokes and puns upon hats and heads,\nand hair and hair-oil, etc. In the midst of Homeric laughter a knock\nresounded, and was heard, in spite of an uproar of toasts and reciprocal\ncongratulations.\n\n\"It is my uncle!\" cried Popinot. \"He has actually come to see me.\"\n\n\"An uncle!\" said Finot, \"and we haven't got a glass!\"\n\n\"The uncle of my friend Popinot is a judge,\" said Gaudissart to Finot,\n\"and he is not to be hoaxed; he saved my life. Ha! when one gets to the\npass where I was, under the scaffold--_Qou-ick_, and good-by to\nyour hair,\"--imitating the fatal knife with voice and gesture. \"One\nrecollects gratefully the virtuous magistrate who saved the gutter where\nthe champagne flows down. Recollect?--I'd recollect him dead-drunk! You\ndon't know what it is, Finot, unless you have stood in need of Monsieur\nPopinot. Huzza! we ought to fire a salute--from six pounders, too!\"\n\nThe virtuous magistrate was now asking for his nephew at the door.\nRecognizing his voice, Anselme went down, candlestick in hand, to light\nhim up.\n\n\"I wish you good evening, gentlemen,\" said the judge.\n\nThe illustrious Gaudissart bowed profoundly. Finot examined the\nmagistrate with a tipsy eye, and thought him a bit of a blockhead.\n\n\"You have not much luxury here,\" said the judge, gravely, looking round\nthe room. \"Well, my son, if we wish to be something great, we must begin\nby being nothing.\"\n\n\"What profound wisdom!\" said Gaudissart to Finot.\n\n\"Text for an article,\" said the journalist.\n\n\"Ah! you here, monsieur?\" said the judge, recognizing the commercial\ntraveller; \"and what are you doing now?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I am contributing to the best of my small ability to the\nsuccess of your dear nephew. We have just been studying a prospectus for\nhis oil; you see before you the author of that prospectus, which seems\nto us the finest essay in the literature of wigs.\" The judge looked at\nFinot. \"Monsieur,\" said Gaudissart, \"is Monsieur Andoche Finot, a young\nman distinguished in literature, who does high-class politics and the\nlittle theatres in the government newspapers,--I may say a statesman on\nthe high-road to becoming an author.\"\n\nFinot pulled Gaudissart by the coat-tails.\n\n\"Well, well, my sons,\" said the judge, to whom these words explained the\naspect of the table, where there stilled remained the tokens of a very\nexcusable feast. \"Anselme,\" said the old gentleman to his nephew, \"dress\nyourself, and come with me to Monsieur Birotteau's, where I have a visit\nto pay. You shall sign the deed of partnership, which I have carefully\nexamined. As you mean to have the manufactory for your oil on the\ngrounds in the Faubourg du Temple, I think you had better take a formal\nlease of them. Monsieur Birotteau might have others in partnership with\nhim, and it is better to settle everything legally at once; then there\ncan be no discussion. These walls seem to me very damp, my dear boy;\ntake up the straw matting near your bed.\"\n\n\"Permit me, monsieur,\" said Gaudissart, with an ingratiating air, \"to\nexplain to you that we have just pasted up the paper ourselves, and\nthat's the--reason why--the walls--are not--dry.\"\n\n\"Economy? quite right,\" said the judge.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Gaudissart in Finot's ear, \"my friend Popinot is a\nvirtuous young man; he is going with his uncle; let's you and I go and\nfinish the evening with our cousins.\"\n\nThe journalist showed the empty lining of his pockets. Popinot saw the\ngesture, and slipped his twenty-franc piece into the palm of the author\nof the prospectus.\n\nThe judge had a coach at the end of the street, in which he carried off\nhis nephew to the Birotteaus.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nPillerault, Monsieur and Madame Ragon, and Monsieur Roguin were playing\nat boston, and Cesarine was embroidering a handkerchief, when the judge\nand Anselme arrived. Roguin, placed opposite to Madame Ragon, near whom\nCesarine was sitting, noticed the pleasure of the young girl when she\nsaw Anselme enter, and he made Crottat a sign to observe that she turned\nas rosy as a pomegranate.\n\n\"This is to be a day of deeds, then?\" said the perfumer, when the\ngreetings were over and the judge told him the purpose of the visit.\n\nCesar, Anselme, and the judge went up to the perfumer's temporary\nbedroom on the second floor to discuss the lease and the deed of\npartnership drawn up by the magistrate. A lease of eighteen years was\nagreed upon, so that it might run the same length of time as the lease\nof the shop in the Rue des Cinq-Diamants,--an insignificant circumstance\napparently, but one which did Birotteau good service in after days. When\nCesar and the judge returned to the _entresol_, the latter, surprised\nat the general upset of the household, and the presence of workmen on\na Sunday in the house of a man so religious as Birotteau, asked the\nmeaning of it,--a question which Cesar had been eagerly expecting.\n\n\"Though you care very little for the world, monsieur,\" he said, \"you\nwill see no harm in celebrating the deliverance of our territory.\nThat, however, is not all. We are about to assemble a few friends to\ncommemorate my promotion to the order of the Legion of honor.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the judge, who was not decorated.\n\n\"Possibly I showed myself worthy of that signal and royal favor by\nmy services on the Bench--oh! of commerce,--and by fighting for the\nBourbons on the steps--\"\n\n\"True,\" said the judge.\n\n\"--of Saint-Roch on the 13th Vendemiaire, where I was wounded by\nNapoleon. May I not hope that you and Madame Popinot will do us the\nhonor of being present?\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said the judge. \"If my wife is well enough I will bring\nher.\"\n\n\"Xandrot,\" said Roguin to his clerk, as they left the house, \"give up\nall thoughts of marrying Cesarine; six weeks hence you will thank me for\nthat advice.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Crottat.\n\n\"My dear fellow, Birotteau is going to spend a hundred thousand francs\non his ball, and he is involving his whole fortune, against my advice,\nin that speculation in lands. Six weeks hence he and his family won't\nhave bread to eat. Marry Mademoiselle Lourdois, the daughter of the\nhouse-painter. She has three hundred thousand francs _dot_. I threw out\nthat anchor to windward for you. If you will pay me a hundred thousand\nfrancs down for my practice, you may have it to-morrow.\"\n\nThe splendors of the approaching ball were announced by the newspapers\nto all Europe, and were also made known to the world of commerce by\nrumors to which the preparations, carried on night and day, had given\nrise. Some said that Cesar had hired three houses, and that he was\ngilding his salons; others that the supper would furnish dishes invented\nfor the occasion. On one hand it was reported that no merchants would be\ninvited, the fete being given to the members of the government; on the\nother hand, Cesar was severely blamed for his ambition, and laughed at\nfor his political pretensions: some people even went so far as to deny\nhis wound. The ball gave rise to more than one intrigue in the second\narrondissement. The friends of the family were easy in their minds,\nbut the demands of mere acquaintances were enormous. Honors bring\nsycophants; and there was a goodly number of people whose invitations\ncost them more than one application. The Birotteaus were fairly\nfrightened at the number of friends whom they did not know they had.\nThese eager attentions alarmed Madame Birotteau, and day by day her face\ngrew sadder as the great solemnity drew near.\n\nIn the first place, as she owned to Cesar, she should never learn the\nright demeanor; next, she was terrified by the innumerable details\nof such a fete: where should she find the plate, the glass-ware, the\nrefreshments, the china, the servants? Who would superintend it all? She\nentreated Birotteau to stand at the door of the appartement and let no\none enter but invited guests; she had heard strange stories of people\nwho came to bourgeois balls, claiming friends whose names they did not\nknow. When, a week before the fateful day, Braschon, Grindot, Lourdois,\nand Chaffaroux, the builder, assured Cesar positively that the rooms\nwould be ready for the famous Sunday of December the 17th, an amusing\nconference took place, in the evening after dinner, between Cesar, his\nwife, and his daughter, for the purpose of making out the list of guests\nand addressing the invitations,--which a stationer had sent home that\nmorning, printed on pink paper, in flowing English writing, and in the\nformula of commonplace and puerile civility.\n\n\"Now we mustn't forget any body,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"If we forget any one,\" said Constance, \"they won't forget it. Madame\nDerville, who never called before, sailed down upon me in all her glory\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"She is very pretty,\" said Cesarine. \"I liked her.\"\n\n\"And yet before her marriage she was even less than I was,\" said\nConstance. \"She did plain sewing in the Rue Montmartre; she made shirts\nfor your father.\"\n\n\"Well, now let us begin the list,\" said Birotteau, \"with the upper-crust\npeople. Cesarine, write down Monsieur le Duc and Madame la Duchesse de\nLenoncourt--\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Cesar!\" said Constance, \"don't send a single invitation\nto people whom you only know as customers. Are you going to invite\nthe Princesse de Blamont-Chavry, who is more nearly related to your\ngodmother, the late Marquise d'Uxelles, than the Duc de Lenoncourt? You\nsurely don't mean to invite the two Messieurs de Vandenesse, Monsieur\nde Marsay, Monsieur de Ronquerolles, Monsieur d'Aiglemont, in short, all\nyour customers? You are mad; your honors have turned your head!\"\n\n\"Well, but there's Monsieur le Comte de Fontaine and his family,\nhein?--the one that always went by the name of GRAND-JACQUES,--and\nthe YOUNG SCAMP, who was the Marquis de Montauran, and Monsieur de la\nBillardiere, who was called the NANTAIS at 'The Queen of Roses' before\nthe 13th Vendemiaire. In those days it was all hand-shaking, and\n'Birotteau, take courage; let yourself be killed, like us, for the good\ncause.' Why, we are all comrades in conspiracy.\"\n\n\"Very good, put them down,\" said Constance. \"If Monsieur de la\nBillardiere comes he will want somebody to speak to.\"\n\n\"Cesarine, write,\" said Birotteau. \"_Primo_, Monsieur the prefect of\nthe Seine; he'll come or he won't come, but any way he commands the\nmunicipality,--honor to whom honor is due. Monsieur de la Billardiere\nand his son, the mayor. Put the number of the guests after their names.\nMy colleague, Monsieur Granet, deputy-mayor, and his wife. She is very\nugly, but never mind, we can't dispense with her. Monsieur Curel, the\njeweller, colonel of the National Guard, his wife, and two daughters.\nThose are what I call the authorities. Now come the big wigs,--Monsieur\nle Comte and Madame la Comtesse de Fontaine, and their daughter,\nMademoiselle Emilie de Fontaine.\"\n\n\"An insolent girl, who makes me leave the shop and speak to her at the\ndoor of the carriage, no matter what the weather is,\" said Madame Cesar.\n\"If she comes, it will only be to ridicule me.\"\n\n\"Then she'll be sure to come,\" said Cesar, bent on getting everybody.\n\"Go on, Cesarine. Monsieur le Comte and Madame la Comtesse de\nGrandville, my landlord,--the longest head at the royal court, so\nDerville says. Ah ca! Monsieur de la Billardiere is to present me as\na chevalier to-morrow to Monsieur le Comte de Lacepede himself, high\nchancellor of the Legion of honor. It is only proper that I should\nsend him an invitation for the ball, and also to the dinner. Monsieur\nVauquelin; put him down for ball and dinner both, Cesarine. And (so\nas not to forget them) put down all the Chiffrevilles and the Protez;\nMonsieur and Madame Popinot, judge of the Lower Court of the Seine;\nMonsieur and Madame Thirion, gentleman-usher of the bedchamber to the\nking, friends of Ragon, and their daughter, who, they tell me, is to\nmarry the son of Monsieur Camusot by his first wife.\"\n\n\"Cesar, don't forget that little Horace Bianchon, the nephew of Monsieur\nPopinot, and cousin of Anselme,\" said Constance.\n\n\"Whew! Cesarine has written a four after the name of Popinot. Monsieur\nand Madame Rabourdin, one of the under-secretaries in Monsieur de la\nBillardiere's division; Monsieur Cochin, same division, his wife\nand son, sleeping-partners of Matifat, and Monsieur, Madame, and\nMademoiselle Matifat themselves.\"\n\n\"The Matifats,\" said Cesarine, \"are fishing for invitations for Monsieur\nand Madame Colleville, and Monsieur and Madame Thuillier, friends of\ntheirs.\"\n\n\"We will see about that,\" said Cesar. \"Put down my broker, Monsieur and\nMadame Jules Desmarets.\"\n\n\"She will be the loveliest woman in the room,\" said Cesarine. \"I like\nher--oh! better than any one else.\"\n\n\"Derville and his wife.\"\n\n\"Put down Monsieur and Madame Coquelin, the successors to my uncle\nPillerault,\" said Constance. \"They are so sure of an invitation that\nthe poor little woman has ordered my dressmaker to make her a superb\nball-dress, a skirt of white satin, and a tulle robe with succory\nflowers embroidered all over it. A little more and she would have\nordered a court-dress of gold brocade. If you leave them out we shall\nmake bitter enemies.\"\n\n\"Put them down, Cesarine; all honor to commerce, for we belong to it!\nMonsieur and Madame Roguin.\"\n\n\"Mamma, Madame Roguin will wear her diamond fillet and all her other\ndiamonds, and her dress trimmed with Mechlin.\"\n\n\"Monsieur and Madame Lebas,\" said Cesar; \"also Monsieur le president of\nthe Court of Commerce,--I forgot him among the authorities,--his wife,\nand two daughters; Monsieur and Madame Lourdois and their daughter;\nMonsieur Claparon, banker; Monsieur du Tillet; Monsieur Grindot;\nMonsieur Molineux; Pillerault and his landlord; Monsieur and Madame\nCamusot, the rich silk-merchants, and all their children, the one at the\nEcole Polytechnique, and the lawyer; he is to be made a judge because of\nhis marriage to Mademoiselle Thirion.\"\n\n\"A provincial judge,\" remarked Constance.\n\n\"Monsieur Cardot, father-in-law of Camusot, and all the Cardot children.\nBless me, and the Guillaumes, Rue du Colombier, the father-in-law of\nLebas--old people, but they'll sit in a corner; Alexandre Crottat;\nCelestin--\"\n\n\"Papa, don't forget Monsieur Andoche Finot and Monsieur Gaudissart, two\nyoung men who are very useful to Monsieur Anselme.\"\n\n\"Gaudissart? he was once in the hands of justice. But never mind, he is\ngoing to travel for our oil and starts in a few days; put him down. As\nto the Sieur Andoche Finot, what is he to us?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Anselme says he will be a great man; he has a mind like\nVoltaire.\"\n\n\"An author? all atheists.\"\n\n\"Let's put him down, papa; we want more dancers. Besides, he wrote the\nbeautiful prospectus for the oil.\"\n\n\"He believes in my oil?\" said Cesar, \"then put him down, dear child.\"\n\n\"I have put down all my proteges,\" said Cesarine.\n\n\"Put Monsieur Mitral, my bailiff; Monsieur Haudry, our doctor, as a\nmatter of form,--he won't come.\"\n\n\"Yes, he will, for his game of cards.\"\n\n\"Now, Cesar, I do hope you mean to invite the Abbe Loraux to the\ndinner,\" said Constance.\n\n\"I have already written to him,\" said Cesar.\n\n\"Oh! and don't forget the sister-in-law of Monsieur Lebas, Madame\nAugustine Sommervieux,\" said Cesarine. \"Poor little woman, she is so\ndelicate; she is dying of grief, so Monsieur Lebas says.\"\n\n\"That's what it is to marry artists!\" cried her father. \"Look! there's\nyour mother asleep,\" he whispered. \"La! la! a very good night to you,\nMadame Cesar--Now, then,\" he added, \"about your mother's ball-dress?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa, it will be all ready. Mamma thinks she will wear her\nchina-crape like mine. The dressmaker is sure there is no need of trying\nit on.\"\n\n\"How many people have you got down,\" said Cesar aloud, seeing that\nConstance opened her eyes.\n\n\"One hundred and nine, with the clerks.\"\n\n\"Where shall we ever put them all?\" said Madame Birotteau. \"But, anyhow,\nafter that Sunday,\" she added naively, \"there will come a Monday.\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nNothing can be done simply and naturally by people who are stepping from\none social level to another. Not a soul--not Madame Birotteau, nor Cesar\nhimself--was allowed to put foot into the new appartement on the first\nfloor. Cesar had promised Raguet, the shop-boy, a new suit of clothes\nfor the day of the ball, if he mounted guard faithfully and let no\none enter. Birotteau, like the Emperor Napoleon at Compiegne, when the\nchateau was re-decorated for his marriage with Maria Louisa of Austria,\nwas determined to see nothing piecemeal; he wished to enjoy the surprise\nof seeing it as a whole. Thus the two antagonists met once more, all\nunknown to themselves, not on the field of battle, but on the peaceful\nground of bourgeois vanity. It was arranged that Monsieur Grindot was to\ntake Cesar by the hand and show him the appartement when finished,--just\nas a guide shows a gallery to a sight-seer. Every member of the family\nhad provided his, or her, private \"surprise.\" Cesarine, dear child, had\nspent all her little hoard, a hundred louis, on buying books for her\nfather. Monsieur Grindot confided to her one morning that there were two\nbook-cases in Cesar's room, which enclosed an alcove,--an architectural\nsurprise to her father. Cesarine flung all her girlish savings upon the\ncounter of a bookseller's shop, and obtained in return, Bossuet, Racine,\nVoltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Montesquieu, Moliere, Buffon, Fenelon,\nDelille, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, La Fontaine, Corneille, Pascal, La\nHarpe,--in short, the whole array of matter-of-course libraries to be\nfound everywhere and which assuredly her father would never read. A\nterrible bill for binding was in the background. The celebrated and\ndilatory binder, Thouvenin, had promised to deliver the volumes at\ntwelve o'clock in the morning of the 16th. Cesarine confided her anxiety\nto her uncle Pillerault, and he had promised to pay the bill. The\n\"surprise\" of Cesar to his wife was the gown of cherry-colored velvet,\ntrimmed with lace, of which he spoke to his accomplice, Cesarine. The\n\"surprise\" of Madame Birotteau to the new chevalier was a pair of gold\nshoe-buckles, and a diamond pin. For the whole family there was the\nsurprise of the new appartement, and, a fortnight later, the still\ngreater surprise of the bills when they came in.\n\nCesar carefully weighed the question as to which invitations should be\ngiven in person, and which should be sent by Raguet. He ordered a coach\nand took his wife--much disfigured by a bonnet with feathers, and his\nlast gift, a shawl which she had coveted for fifteen years--on a round\nof civilities. In their best array, these worthy people paid twenty-two\nvisits in the course of one morning.\n\nCesar excused his wife from the labor and difficulty of preparing at\nhome the various viands demanded by the splendor of the entertainment.\nA diplomatic treaty was arranged between the famous Chevet and the\nperfumer. Chevet furnished superb silver plate (which brought him an\nincome equal to that of land); he supplied the dinner, the wines, and\nthe waiters, under the orders of a major-domo of dignified aspect, who\nwas responsible for the proper management of everything. Chevet exacted\nthat the kitchen, and the dining-room on the _entresol_, should be given\nup to him as headquarters; a dinner for twenty people was to be served\nat six o'clock, a superb supper at one in the morning. Birotteau\narranged with the cafe Foy for ices in the shape of fruits, to be served\nin pretty saucers, with gilt spoons, on silver trays. Tanrade, another\nillustrious purveyor, furnished the refreshments.\n\n\"Don't be worried,\" said Cesar to his wife, observing her uneasiness on\nthe day before the great event, \"Chevet, Tanrade, and the cafe Foy will\noccupy the _entresol_, Virginie will take charge of the second floor,\nthe shop will be closed; all we shall have to do is to enshrine\nourselves on the first floor.\"\n\nAt two o'clock, on the 16th, the mayor, Monsieur de la Billardiere, came\nto take Cesar to the Chancellerie of the Legion of honor, where he\nwas to be received by Monsieur le Comte de Lacepede, and about a dozen\nchevaliers of the order. Tears were in his eyes when he met the mayor;\nConstance had just given him the \"surprise\" of the gold buckles and\ndiamond pin.\n\n\"It is very sweet to be so loved,\" he said, getting into the coach in\npresence of the assembled clerks, and Cesarine, and Constance. They,\none and all, gazed at Cesar, attired in black silk knee-breeches, silk\nstockings, and the new bottle-blue coat, on which was about to gleam the\nribbon that, according to Molineux, was dyed in blood. When Cesar came\nhome to dinner, he was pale with joy; he looked at his cross in all the\nmirrors, for in the first moments of exultation he was not satisfied\nwith the ribbon,--he wore the cross, and was glorious without false\nshame.\n\n\"My wife,\" he said, \"Monsieur the high chancellor is a charming man. On\na hint from La Billardiere he accepted my invitation. He is coming with\nMonsieur Vauquelin. Monsieur de Lacepede is a great man,--yes, as great\nas Monsieur Vauquelin; he has continued the work of Buffon in forty\nvolumes; he is an author, peer of France! Don't forget to address him\nas, Your Excellence, or, Monsieur le comte.\"\n\n\"Do eat something,\" said his wife. \"Your father is worse than a child,\"\nadded Constance to Cesarine.\n\n\"How well it looks in your button-hole,\" said Cesarine. \"When we walk\nout together, won't they present arms?\"\n\n\"Yes, wherever there are sentries they will present arms.\"\n\nJust at this moment Grindot was coming downstairs with Braschon. It had\nbeen arranged that after dinner, monsieur, madame, and mademoiselle were\nto enjoy a first sight of the new appartement; Braschon's foreman was\nnow nailing up the last brackets, and three men were lighting the rooms.\n\n\"It takes a hundred and twenty wax-candles,\" said Braschon.\n\n\"A bill of two hundred francs at Trudon's,\" said Madame Cesar, whose\nmurmurs were checked by a glance from the chevalier Birotteau.\n\n\"Your ball will be magnificent, Monsieur le chevalier,\" said Braschon.\n\nBirotteau whispered to himself, \"Flatterers already! The Abbe Loraux\nurged me not to fall into that net, but to keep myself humble. I shall\ntry to remember my origin.\"\n\nCesar did not perceive the meaning of the rich upholsterer's speech.\nBraschon made a dozen useless attempts to get invitations for himself,\nhis wife, daughter, mother-in-law, and aunt. He called the perfumer\nMonsieur le chevalier to the door-way, and then he departed his enemy.\n\nThe rehearsal began. Cesar, his wife, and Cesarine went out by the\nshop-door and re-entered the house from the street. The entrance had\nbeen remodelled in the grand style, with double doors, divided into\nsquare panels, in the centre of which were architectural ornaments in\ncast-iron, painted. This style of door, since become common in Paris,\nwas then a novelty. At the further end of the vestibule the staircase\nwent up in two straight flights, and between them was the space which\nhad given Cesar some uneasiness, and which was now converted into\na species of box, where it was possible to seat an old woman. The\nvestibule, paved in black and white marble, with its walls painted to\nresemble marble, was lighted by an antique lamp with four jets. The\narchitect had combined richness with simplicity. A narrow red carpet\nrelieved the whiteness of the stairs, which were polished with\npumice-stone. The first landing gave an entrance to the _entresol_; the\ndoors to each appartement were of the same character as the street-door,\nbut of finer work by a cabinet-maker.\n\nThe family reached the first floor and entered an ante-chamber in\nexcellent taste, spacious, parquetted, and simply decorated. Next came a\nsalon, with three windows on the street, in white and red, with\ncornices of an elegant design which had nothing gaudy about them. On\na chimney-piece of white marble supported by columns were a number of\nmantel ornaments chosen with taste; they suggested nothing to ridicule,\nand were in keeping with the other details. A soft harmony prevailed\nthroughout the room, a harmony which artists alone know how to attain by\ncarrying uniformity of decoration into the minutest particulars,--an art\nof which the bourgeois mind is ignorant, though it is much taken with\nits results. A glass chandelier, with twenty-four wax-candles, brought\nout the color of the red silk draperies; the polished floor had an\nenticing look, which tempted Cesarine to dance.\n\n\"How charming!\" she said; \"and yet there is nothing to seize the eye.\"\n\n\"Exactly, mademoiselle,\" said the architect; \"the charm comes from the\nharmony which reigns between the wainscots, walls, cornices, and the\ndecorations; I have gilded nothing, the colors are sober, and not\nextravagant in tone.\"\n\n\"It is a science,\" said Cesarine.\n\nA boudoir in green and white led into Cesar's study.\n\n\"Here I have put a bed,\" said Grindot, opening the doors of an alcove\ncleverly hidden between the two bookcases. \"If you or madame should\nchance to be ill, each can have your own room.\"\n\n\"But this bookcase full of books, all bound! Oh! my wife, my wife!\"\ncried Cesar.\n\n\"No; that is Cesarine's surprise.\"\n\n\"Pardon the feelings of a father,\" said Cesar to the architect, as he\nkissed his daughter.\n\n\"Oh! of course, of course, monsieur,\" said Grindot; \"you are in your own\nhome.\"\n\nBrown was the prevailing color in the study, relieved here and there\nwith green, for a thread of harmony led through all the rooms and allied\nthem with one another. Thus the color which was the leading tone of one\nroom became the relieving tint of another. The engraving of Hero and\nLeander shone on one of the panels of Cesar's study.\n\n\"Ah! _thou_ wilt pay for all this,\" said Birotteau, looking gaily at it.\n\n\"That beautiful engraving is given to you by Monsieur Anselme,\" said\nCesarine.\n\n(Anselme, too, had allowed himself a \"surprise.\")\n\n\"Poor boy! he has done just as I did for Monsieur Vauquelin.\"\n\nThe bedroom of Madame Birotteau came next. The architect had there\ndisplayed a magnificence well calculated to please the worthy people\nwhom he was anxious to snare; he had really kept his word and _studied_\nthis decoration. The room was hung in blue silk, with white ornaments;\nthe furniture was in white cassimere touched with blue. On the\nchimney-piece, of white marble, stood a clock representing Venus\ncrouching, on a fine block of marble; a moquette carpet, of Turkish\ndesign, harmonized this room with that of Cesarine, which opened out\nof it, and was coquettishly hung with Persian chintz. A piano, a pretty\nwardrobe with a mirror door, a chaste little bed with simple curtains,\nand all the little trifles that young girls like, completed the\narrangements of the room. The dining-room was behind the bedroom of\nCesar and his wife, and was entered from the staircase; it was treated\nin the style called Louis XIV., with a clock in buhl, buffets of the\nsame, inlaid with brass and tortoise-shell; the walls were hung with\npurple stuff, fastened down by gilt nails. The happiness of these three\npersons is not to be described, more especially when, re-entering her\nroom, Madame Birotteau found upon her bed (where Virginie had just\ncarried it, on tiptoe) the robe of cherry-colored velvet, with lace\ntrimmings, which was her husband's \"surprise.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, this appartement will win you great distinction,\" said\nConstance to Grindot. \"We shall receive a hundred and more persons\nto-morrow evening, and you will win praises from everybody.\"\n\n\"I shall recommend you,\" said Cesar. \"You will meet the very _heads_ of\ncommerce, and you will be better known through that one evening than if\nyou had built a hundred houses.\"\n\nConstance, much moved, thought no longer of costs, nor of blaming her\nhusband; and for the following reason: That morning, when he brought the\nengraving of Hero and Leander, Anselme Popinot, whom Constance credited\nwith much intelligence and practical ability, had assured her of the\ninevitable success of Cephalic Oil, for which he was working night and\nday with a fury that was almost unprecedented. The lover promised that\nno matter what was the round sum of Birotteau's extravagance, it should\nbe covered in six months by Cesar's share in the profits of the oil.\nAfter fearing and trembling for nineteen years it was so sweet to give\nherself up to one day of unalloyed happiness, that Constance promised\nher daughter not to poison her husband's pleasure by any doubts or\ndisapproval, but to share his happiness heartily. When therefore, about\neleven o'clock, Grindot left them, she threw herself into her husband's\narms and said to him with tears of joy, \"Cesar! ah, I am beside myself!\nYou have made me very happy!\"\n\n\"Provided it lasts, you mean?\" said Cesar, smiling.\n\n\"It will last; I have no more fears,\" said Madame Birotteau.\n\n\"That's right,\" said the perfumer; \"you appreciate me at last.\"\n\nPeople who are sufficiently large-minded to perceive their own innate\nweakness will admit that an orphan girl who eighteen years earlier was\nsaleswoman at the Petit-Matelot, Ile Saint-Louis, and a poor peasant lad\ncoming from Touraine to Paris with hob-nailed shoes and a cudgel in his\nhand, might well be flattered and happy in giving such a fete for such\npraiseworthy reasons.\n\n\"Bless my heart!\" cried Cesar. \"I'd give a hundred francs if someone\nwould only come in now and pay us a visit.\"\n\n\"Here is Monsieur l'Abbe Loraux,\" said Virginie.\n\nThe abbe entered. He was at that time vicar of Saint-Sulpice. The power\nof the soul was never better manifested than in this saintly priest,\nwhose intercourse with others left upon the minds of all an indelible\nimpression. His grim face, so plain as to check confidence, had grown\nsublime through the exercise of Catholic virtues; upon it shone, as\nit were by anticipation, the celestial glories. Sincerity and candor,\ninfused into his very blood, gave harmony to his unsightly features, and\nthe fires of charity blended the discordant lines by a phenomenon, the\nexact counterpart of that which in Claparon had debased and brutalized\nthe human being. Faith, Hope, and Charity, the three noblest virtues\nof humanity, shed their charm among the abbe's wrinkles; his speech\nwas gentle, slow, and penetrating. His dress was that of the priests of\nParis, and he allowed himself to wear a brown frock-coat. No ambition\nhad ever crept into that pure heart, which the angels would some day\ncarry to God in all its pristine innocence. It required the gentle\nfirmness of the daughter of Louis XVI. to induce him to accept a\nbenefice in Paris, humble as it was. As he now entered the room he\nglanced with an uneasy eye at the magnificence before him, smiled at the\nthree delighted people, and shook his gray head.\n\n\"My children,\" he said, \"my part in life is not to share in gaieties,\nbut to visit the afflicted. I came to thank Monsieur Cesar for his\ninvitation, and to congratulate you. I shall come to only one fete\nhere,--the marriage of this dear child.\"\n\nAfter the short visit the abbe went away without seeing the various\napartments, which the perfumer and his wife dared not show him. This\nsolemn apparition threw a few drops of cold water into the boiling\ndelight of Cesar's heart. Each of the party slept amid their new luxury,\ntaking possession of the good things and the pretty things they\nhad severally wished for. Cesarine undressed her mother before a\ntoilet-table of white marble with a long mirror. Cesar had given himself\na few superfluities, and longed to make use of them at once: and they\nall went to sleep thinking of the joys of the morrow.\n\nOn that morrow Cesarine and her mother, having been to Mass, and having\nread their vespers, dressed about four o'clock in the afternoon, after\nresigning the _entresol_ to the secular arm of Chevet and his people. No\nattire ever suited Madame Cesar better than this cherry-colored velvet\ndress with lace trimmings, and short sleeves made with jockeys: her\nbeautiful arms, still fresh and youthful, her bosom, sparklingly white,\nher throat and shoulders of a lovely shape, were all heightened in\neffect by the rich material and the resplendent color. The naive delight\nwhich every woman feels when she sees herself in the plenitude of her\npower gave an inexpressible sweetness to the Grecian profile of this\ncharming woman, whose beauty had all the delicacy of a cameo. Cesarine,\ndressed in white crape, wore a wreath of white roses, a rose at her\nwaist, and a scarf chastely covering her shoulders and bust: Popinot was\nbeside himself.\n\n\"These people crush us,\" said Madame Roguin to her husband as they went\nthrough the appartement.\n\nThe notary's wife was furious at appearing less beautiful than Madame\nCesar; for every woman knows how to judge the superiority or the\ninferiority of a rival.\n\n\"Bah!\" whispered Roguin to his wife, \"it won't last long; you will soon\nbespatter her when you meet her a-foot in the streets, ruined.\"\n\nVauquelin showed perfect tact; he came with Monsieur de Lacepede, his\ncolleague of the Institute, who had called to fetch him in a carriage.\nOn beholding the resplendent mistress of the fete they both launched\ninto scientific compliments.\n\n\"Ah, madame, you possess a secret of which science is ignorant,\" said\nthe chemist, \"the recipe for remaining young and beautiful.\"\n\n\"You are, as I may say, partly at home here, Monsieur l'academicien,\"\nsaid Birotteau. \"Yes, Monsieur le comte,\" he added, turning to the\nhigh chancellor of the Legion of honor, \"I owe my fortune to Monsieur\nVauquelin. I have the honor to present to your lordship Monsieur\nle president of the Court of Commerce. This is Monsieur le Comte de\nLacepede, peer of France,\" he said to Joseph Lebas, who accompanied the\npresident.\n\nThe guests were punctual. The dinner, like all commercial dinners, was\nextremely gay, full of good humor, and enlivened by the rough jests\nwhich always raise a laugh. The excellence of the dishes and the\ngoodness of the wines were fully appreciated. It was half-past nine\no'clock when the company returned to the salons to take their coffee. A\nfew hackney-coaches had already brought the first impatient dancers.\nAn hour later the rooms were full, and the ball took the character of a\nrout. Monsieur de Lacepede and Monsieur Vauquelin went away, much to the\ngrief of Cesar, who followed them to the staircase, vainly entreating\nthem to remain. He succeeded, however, in keeping Monsieur Popinot the\njudge, and Monsieur de la Billardiere. With the exception of three\nwomen who severally represented the aristocracy, finance, and government\ncircles,--namely, Mademoiselle de Fontaine, Madame Jules, and Madame\nRabourdin, whose beauty, dress, and manners were sharply defined in this\nassemblage,--all the other women wore heavy, over-loaded dresses, and\noffered to the eye that anomalous air of richness which gives to the\nbourgeois masses their vulgar aspect, made cruelly apparent on this\noccasion by the airy graces of the three other women.\n\nThe bourgeoisie of the Rue Saint-Denis displayed itself majestically in\nthe plenitude of its native powers of jocose silliness. It was a fair\nspecimen of that middle class which dresses its children like lancers\nor national guards, buys the \"Victoires et Conquetes,\" the\n\"Soldat-laboureur,\" admires the \"Convoi du Pauvre,\" delights in mounting\nguard, goes on Sunday to its own country-house, is anxious to acquire\nthe distinguished air, and dreams of municipal honors,--that middle\nclass which is jealous of all and of every one, and yet is good,\nobliging, devoted, feeling, compassionate, ready to subscribe for the\nchildren of General Foy, or for the Greeks, whose piracies it knows\nnothing about, or the Exiles until none remained; duped through its\nvirtues and scouted for its defects by a social class that is not worthy\nof it, for it has a heart precisely because it is ignorant of social\nconventions,--that virtuous middle-class which brings up ingenuous\ndaughters to an honorable toil, giving them sterling qualities which\ndiminish as soon as they are brought in contact with the superior world\nof social life; girls without mind, among whom the worthy Chrysale would\nhave chosen his wife,--in short, a middle-class admirably represented by\nthe Matifats, druggists in the Rue des Lombards, whose firm had supplied\n\"The Queen of Roses\" for more than sixty years.\n\nMadame Matifat, wishing to give herself a dignified air, danced in a\nturban and a heavy robe of scarlet shot with gold threads,--a toilet\nwhich harmonized well with a self-important manner, a Roman nose, and\nthe splendors of a crimson complexion. Monsieur Matifat, superb at a\nreview of the National Guard, where his protuberant paunch could be\ndistinguished at fifty paces, and upon which glittered a gold chain\nand a bunch of trinkets, was under the yoke of this Catherine II. of\ncommerce. Short and fat, harnessed with spectacles and a shirt-collar\nworn above his ears, he was chiefly distinguished for his bass voice\nand the richness of his vocabulary. He never said Corneille, but \"the\nsublime Corneille\"; Racine was \"the gentle Racine\"; Voltaire, \"Oh!\nVoltaire, second in everything, with more wit than genius, but\nnevertheless a man of genius\"; Rousseau, \"a gloomy mind, a man full of\npride, who hanged himself.\" He related in his prosy way vulgar anecdotes\nof Piron, a poet who passes for a prodigy among the bourgeoisie.\nMatifat, a passionate lover of the stage, had a slight leaning to\nobscenity. It was even said that, in imitation of Cadot and the rich\nCamusot, he kept a mistress. Sometimes Madame Matifat, seeing him about\nto relate some questionable anecdote, would hasten to interrupt him by\nscreaming out: \"Take care what you are saying, old man!\" She called\nhim habitually her \"old man.\" This voluminous queen of drugs caused\nMademoiselle de Fontaine to lose her aristocratic countenance, for the\nimpertinent girl could not help laughing as she overheard her saying\nto her husband: \"Don't fling yourself upon the ices, old man, it is bad\nstyle.\"\n\nIt is more difficult to explain the nature of the difference between\nthe great world and the bourgeoisie than it is for the bourgeoisie to\nobliterate it. These women, embarrassed by their fine clothes and very\nconscious of them, displayed a naive pleasure which proved that a\nball was a rarity in their busy lives; while the three women, who each\nrepresented a sphere in the great world, were then exactly what they\nwould be on the morrow. They had no appearance of having dressed\npurposely for the ball, they paid no heed to the splendor of their\njewels, nor to the effect which they themselves produced; all had been\narranged when they stood before their mirrors and put the last touches\non their toilets. Their faces showed no excitement or excessive\ninterest, and they danced with the grace and ease which unknown genius\nhas given to certain statues of antiquity.\n\nThe others, on the contrary, stamped with the mark of toil, retained\ntheir vulgar attitudes, and amused themselves too heartily; their eyes\nwere full of inconsiderate curiosity; their voices ranged above the\nlow murmur which gives inimitable piquancy to the conversations of a\nball-room; above all, they had none of that composed impertinence\nwhich contains the germs of epigram, nor the tranquil attitude\nwhich characterizes those who are accustomed to maintain empire over\nthemselves. Thus Madame Rabourdin, Madame Jules, and Mademoiselle\nde Fontaine, who had expected much amusement from the ball of their\nperfumer, were detached from the background of the bourgeoisie about\nthem by their soft and easy grace, by the exquisite taste of their dress\nand bearing,--just as three leading singers at an opera stand out in\nrelief from the stolid array of their supernumeraries. They were watched\nwith jealous, wondering eyes. Madame Roguin, Constance, and Cesarine\nformed, as it were, a link which united the three types of feminine\naristocracy to the commercial figures about them.\n\nThere came, as there does at all balls, a moment when the animation of\nthe scene, the torrents of light, the gaiety, the music, the excitement\nof dancing brought on a species of intoxication which puts out of\nsight these gradations in the _crescendo_ of the _tutti_. The ball was\nbeginning to be noisy, and Mademoiselle de Fontaine made a movement to\nretire; but when she looked about for the arm of her venerable Vendeen,\nBirotteau, his wife, and daughter made haste to prevent such a desertion\nof the aristocracy.\n\n\"There is a perfume of good taste about this appartement which really\namazes me,\" remarked that impertinent young woman to the perfumer. \"I\ncongratulate you.\"\n\nBirotteau was so intoxicated by compliments that he did not comprehend\nher meaning; but his wife colored, and was at a loss how to reply.\n\n\"This is a national fete which does you honor,\" said Camusot.\n\n\"I have seldom seen such a ball,\" said Monsieur de la Billardiere, to\nwhom an official falsehood was of no consequence.\n\nBirotteau took all these compliments seriously.\n\n\"What an enchanting scene! What a fine orchestra! Will you often give us\na ball?\" said Madame Lebas.\n\n\"What a charming appartement! Is this your own taste?\" said Madame\nDesmarets.\n\nBirotteau ventured on a fib, and allowed her to suppose that he had\ndesigned it.\n\nCesarine, who was asked, of course, for all the dances, understood very\nwell Anselme's delicacy in that matter.\n\n\"If I thought only of my own wishes,\" he had whispered as they left the\ndinner-table, \"I should beg you to grant me the favor of a quadrille;\nbut my happiness would be too costly to our mutual self-love.\"\n\nCesarine, who thought all men walked ungracefully if they stood straight\non their legs, was resolved to open the ball with Popinot. Popinot,\nemboldened by his aunt, who told him to dare all, ventured to tell his\nlove to the charming girl, during the pauses of the quadrille, using,\nhowever, the roundabout terms of a timid lover.\n\n\"My fortune depends on you, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"And how?\"\n\n\"There is but one hope that can enable me to make it.\"\n\n\"Then hope.\"\n\n\"Do you know what you have said to me in those two words?\" murmured\nPopinot.\n\n\"Hope for fortune,\" said Cesarine, with an arch smile.\n\n\"Gaudissart! Gaudissart!\" exclaimed Anselme, when the quadrille was\nover, pressing the arm of his friend with Herculean force. \"Succeed, or\nI'll blow my brains out! Success, and I shall marry Cesarine! she has\ntold me so: see how lovely she is!\"\n\n\"Yes, she is prettily tricked out,\" said Gaudissart, \"and rich. We'll\nfry her in oil.\"\n\nThe good understanding between Mademoiselle Lourdois and Alexandre\nCrottat, the promised successor to Roguin, was noticed by Madame\nBirotteau, who could not give up without a pang the hope of seeing her\ndaughter the wife of a notary of Paris.\n\nUncle Pillerault, who had exchanged bows with little Molineux,\nseated himself in an armchair near the bookshelves. He looked at the\ncard-players, listened to the conversations, and went to the doorway\nevery now and then to watch the oscillating bouquet of flowers formed by\nthe circling heads of the dancers in the _moulinet_. The expression of\nhis face was that of a true philosopher. The men were dreadful,--all,\nthat is, except du Tillet, who had acquired the manners of the great\nworld, little La Billardiere, a budding fashionable, Monsieur Desmarets,\nand the official personages. But among all the faces, more or less\ncomical, from which the assemblage took its character, there was\none that was particularly washed-out, like a five-franc piece of the\nRepublic, and whose owner's apparel rendered him a curiosity. We\nguess at once the little tyrant of the Cour Batave, arrayed with\nlinen yellowed by lying by in a cupboard, and exhibiting to the eye a\nshirt-frill of lace that had been an heirloom, fastened with a bluish\ncameo set as a pin; he wore short black-silk breeches which revealed the\nskinny legs on which he boldly stood. Cesar showed him, triumphantly,\nthe four rooms constructed by the architect out of the first floors of\nthe two houses.\n\n\"Hey! hey! Well, it is your affair, Monsieur Birotteau,\" said Molineux.\n\"My first floor thus improved will be worth more than three thousand\nfrancs to me.\"\n\nBirotteau answered with a jest; but he was pricked as if with a pin at\nthe tone in which the little old man had pronounced the words.\n\n\"I shall soon have my first floor back again; the man will ruin\nhimself.\" Such was the real meaning of the speech which Molineux\ndelivered like the scratch of a claw.\n\nThe sallow face and vindictive eye of the old man struck du Tillet,\nwhose attention had first been attracted by a watch-chain from which\nhung a pound of jingling gew-gaws, and by a green coat with a collar\nwhimsically cocked up, which gave the old man the semblance of a\nrattlesnake. The banker approached the usurer to find out how and why he\nhad thus bedizened himself.\n\n\"There, monsieur,\" said Molineux, planting one foot in the boudoir, \"I\nstand upon the property of Monsieur le Comte de Grandville; but here,\"\nhe added, showing the other, \"I stand upon my own. I am the owner of\nthis house.\"\n\nMolineux was so ready to lend himself to any one who would listen to\nhim, and so delighted by du Tillet's attentive manner, that he gave a\nsketch of his life, related his habits and customs, told the improper\nconduct of the Sieur Gendrin, and, finally, explained all his\narrangements with the perfumer, without which, he said, the ball could\nnot have been given.\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur Cesar let you settle the lease?\" said du Tillet. \"It is\ncontrary to his habits.\"\n\n\"Oh! I asked it of him. I am good to my tenants.\"\n\n\"If Pere Birotteau fails,\" thought du Tillet, \"this little imp would\nmake an excellent assignee. His sharpness is invaluable; when he is\nalone he must amuse himself by catching flies, like Domitian.\"\n\nDu Tillet went to the card-table, where Claparon was already stationed,\nunder orders; Ferdinand thought that under shelter of a game of\n_bouillotte_ his counterfeit banker might escape notice. Their demeanor\nto each other was that of two strangers, and the most suspicious man\ncould have detected nothing that betrayed an understanding between them.\nGaudissart, who knew the career of Claparon, dared not approach him\nafter receiving a solemnly frigid glance from the promoted commercial\ntraveller which warned him that the upstart banker was not to be\nrecognized by any former comrade. The ball, like a brilliant rocket,\nwas extinguished by five o'clock in the morning. At that hour only some\nforty hackney-coaches remained, out of the hundred or more which\nhad crowded the Rue Saint-Honore. Within, they were dancing the\n_boulangere_, which has since been dethroned by the cotillon and\nthe English galop. Du Tillet, Roguin, Cardot junior, the Comte de\nGrandville, and Jules Desmarets were playing at _bouillotte_. Du Tillet\nwon three thousand francs. The day began to dawn, the wax lights paled,\nthe players joined the dancers for a last quadrille. In such houses\nthe final scenes of a ball never pass off without some impropriety. The\ndignified personages have departed; the intoxication of dancing, the\nheat of the atmosphere, the spirits concealed in the most innocent\ndrinks, have mellowed the angularities of the old women, who\ngood-naturedly join in the last quadrille and lend themselves to the\nexcitement of the moment; the men are heated, their hair, lately curled,\nstraggles down their faces, and gives them a grotesque expression which\nexcites laughter; the young women grow volatile, and a few flowers\ndrop from their garlands. The bourgeois Momus appears, followed by his\nrevellers. Laughs ring loudly; all present surrender to the amusement\nof the moment, knowing that on the morrow toil will resume its sway.\nMatifat danced with a woman's bonnet on his head; Celestin called the\nfigures of the interminable country dance, and some of the women beat\ntheir hands together excitedly at the words of command.\n\n\"How they do amuse themselves!\" cried the happy Birotteau.\n\n\"I hope they won't break anything,\" said Constance to her uncle.\n\n\"You have given the most magnificent ball I have ever seen, and I have\nseen many,\" said du Tillet, bowing to his old master.\n\nAmong the eight symphonies of Beethoven there is a theme, glorious as a\npoem, which dominates the finale of the symphony in C minor. When,\nafter slow preparations by the sublime magician, so well understood by\nHabeneck, the enthusiastic leader of an orchestra raises the rich veil\nwith a motion of his hand and calls forth the transcendent theme towards\nwhich the powers of music have all converged, poets whose hearts have\nthrobbed at those sounds will understand how the ball of Cesar Birotteau\nproduced upon his simple being the same effect that this fecund harmony\nwrought in theirs,--an effect to which the symphony in C minor owes its\nsupremacy over its glorious sisters. A radiant fairy springs forward,\nlifting high her wand. We hear the rustle of the violet silken curtains\nwhich the angels raise. Sculptured golden doors, like those of the\nbaptistery at Florence, turn on their diamond hinges. The eye is lost in\nsplendid vistas: it sees a long perspective of rare palaces where beings\nof a loftier nature glide. The incense of all prosperities sends up its\nsmoke, the altar of all joy flames, the perfumed air circulates! Beings\nwith divine smiles, robed in white tunics bordered with blue, flit\nlightly before the eyes and show us visions of supernatural beauty,\nshapes of an incomparable delicacy. The Loves hover in the air and waft\nthe flames of their torches! We feel ourselves beloved; we are happy\nas we breathe a joy we understand not, as we bathe in the waves of a\nharmony that flows for all, and pours out to all the ambrosia that\neach desires. We are held in the grasp of our secret hopes which are\nrealized, for an instant, as we listen. When he has led us through the\nskies, the great magician, with a deep mysterious transition of the\nbasses, flings us back into the marshes of cold reality, only to draw us\nforth once more when, thirsting for his divine melodies, our souls cry\nout, \"Again! Again!\" The psychical history of that rare moment in the\nglorious finale of the C minor symphony is also that of the emotions\nexcited by this fete in the souls of Cesar and of Constance. The flute\nof Collinet sounded the last notes of their commercial symphony.\n\nWeary, but happy, the Birotteaus fell asleep in the early morning amid\nechoes of the fete,--which for building, repairs, furnishing, suppers,\ntoilets, and the library (repaid to Cesarine), cost not less, though\nCesar was little aware of it, than sixty thousand francs. Such was the\nprice of the fatal red ribbon fastened by the king to the buttonhole\nof an honest perfumer. If misfortunes were to overtake Cesar Birotteau,\nthis mad extravagance would be sufficient to arraign him before the\ncriminal courts. A merchant is amenable to the laws if, in the event of\nbankruptcy, he is shown to have been guilty of \"excessive expenditure.\"\nIt is perhaps more dreadful to go before the lesser courts charged with\nfolly or blundering mistakes, than before the Court of Assizes for an\nenormous fraud. In the eyes of some people, it is better to be criminal\nthan a fool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART II. CESAR GRAPPLING WITH MISFORTUNE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nEight days after his ball, the last dying flash of a prosperity of\neighteen years now about to be extinguished, Cesar Birotteau watched the\npassers-by from the windows of his shop, thinking over the expansion of\nhis affairs, and beginning to find them burdensome. Until then all had\nbeen simple in his life; he manufactured and sold, or bought to sell\nagain. To-day the land speculation, his share in the house of A. Popinot\nand Company, the repayment of the hundred and sixty thousand francs\nthrown upon the market, which necessitated either a traffic in\npromissory notes (of which his wife would disapprove), or else some\nunheard-of success in Cephalic Oil, all fretted the poor man by the\nmultiplicity of ideas which they involved; he felt he had more irons in\nthe fire than he could lay hold of. How would Anselme guide the helm?\nBirotteau treated Popinot as a professor of rhetoric treats a pupil,--he\ndistrusted his methods, and regretted that he was not at his elbow. The\nkick he had given Popinot to make him hold his tongue at Vauquelin's\nexplains the uneasiness which the young merchant inspired in his mind.\n\nBirotteau took care that neither his wife nor his daughter nor the\nclerks should suspect his anxiety; but he was in truth like a humble\nboatman on the Seine whom the government has suddenly put in command\nof a frigate. Troubled thoughts filled his mind, never very capable of\nreflection, as if with a fog; he stood still, as it were, and peered\nabout to see his way. At this moment a figure appeared in the street\nfor which he felt a violent antipathy; it was that of his new landlord,\nlittle Molineux. Every one has dreamed dreams filled with the events\nof a lifetime, in which there appears and reappears some wayward being,\ncommissioned to play the mischief and be the villain of the piece. To\nBirotteau's fancy Molineux seemed delegated by chance to fill some part\nin his life. His weird face had grinned diabolically at the ball, and he\nhad looked at its magnificence with an evil eye. Catching sight of him\nagain at this moment, Cesar was all the more reminded of the impression\nthe little skin-flint (a word of his vocabulary) had made upon him,\nbecause Molineux excited fresh repugnance by reappearing in the midst of\nhis anxious reverie.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the little man, in his atrociously hypocritical voice,\n\"we settled our business so hastily that you forgot to guarantee the\nsignatures on the little private deed.\"\n\nBirotteau took the lease to repair the mistake. The architect came in\nat this moment, and bowed to the perfumer, looking about him with a\ndiplomatic air.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he whispered to Cesar presently, \"you can easily understand\nthat the first steps in a profession are difficult; you said you were\nsatisfied with me, and it would oblige me very much if you would pay me\nmy commission.\"\n\nBirotteau, who had stripped himself of ready money when he put his\ncurrent cash into Roguin's hands two weeks earlier, called to Celestin\nto make out an order for two thousand francs at ninety days' sight, and\nto write the form of a receipt.\n\n\"I am very glad you took part of your neighbor's rental on yourself,\"\nsaid Molineux in a sly, half-sneering tone. \"My porter came to tell me\njust now that the sheriff has affixed the seals to the Sieur Cayron's\nappartement; he has disappeared.\"\n\n\"I hope I'm not juggled out of five thousand francs,\" thought Birotteau.\n\n\"Cayron always seemed to do a good business,\" said Lourdois, who just\nthen came in to bring his bill.\n\n\"A merchant is never safe from commercial reverses until he has retired\nfrom business,\" said little Molineux, folding up his document with fussy\nprecision.\n\nThe architect watched the queer old man with the enjoyment all artists\nfind in getting hold of a caricature which confirms their theories about\nthe bourgeoisie.\n\n\"When we have got our head under an umbrella we generally think it is\nprotected from the rain,\" he said.\n\nMolineux noticed the mustachios and the little chin-tuft of the artist\nmuch more than he did his face, and he despised that individual folly as\nmuch as Grindot despised him. He waited to give him a parting scratch\nas he went out. By dint of living so long with his cats Molineux had\nacquired, in his manners as well as in his eyes, something unmistakably\nfeline.\n\nJust at this moment Ragon and Pillerault came in.\n\n\"We have been talking of the land affair with the judge,\" said Ragon in\nCesar's ear; \"he says that in a speculation of that kind we must have a\nwarranty from the sellers, and record the deeds, and pay in cash, before\nwe are really owners and co-partners.\"\n\n\"Ah! you are talking of the lands about the Madeleine,\" said Lourdois;\n\"there is a good deal said about them: there will be some houses to\nbuild.\"\n\nThe painter who had come intending to have his bill settled, suddenly\nthought it more to his interest not to press Birotteau.\n\n\"I brought my bill because it was the end of the year,\" he whispered to\nCesar; \"but there's no hurry.\"\n\n\"What is the matter, Cesar?\" said Pillerault, noticing the amazement\nof his nephew, who, having glanced at the bill, made no reply to either\nRagon or Lourdois.\n\n\"Oh, a trifle. I took notes to the amount of five thousand francs from\nmy neighbor, a dealer in umbrellas, and he has failed. If he has given\nme bad securities I shall be caught, like a fool.\"\n\n\"And yet I have warned you many times,\" cried Ragon; \"a drowning man\nwill catch at his father's leg to save himself, and drown him too. I\nhave seen so many failures! People are not exactly scoundrels when the\ndisaster begins, but they soon come to be, out of sheer necessity.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Pillerault.\n\n\"If I ever get into the Chamber of Deputies, and ever have any influence\nin the government,\" said Birotteau, rising on his toes and dropping back\non his heels,--\n\n\"What would you do?\" said Lourdois, \"for you've a long head.\"\n\nMolineux, interested in any discussion about law, lingered in the shop;\nand as the attention of a few persons is apt to make others attentive,\nPillerault and Ragon listened as gravely as the three strangers, though\nthey perfectly well knew Cesar's opinions.\n\n\"I would have,\" said the perfumer, \"a court of irremovable judges, with\na magistracy to attend to the application and execution of the laws.\nAfter the examination of a case, during which the judge should fulfil\nthe functions of agent, assignee, and commissioner, the merchant\nshould be declared _insolvent with rights of reinstatement_, or else\n_bankrupt_. If the former, he should be required to pay in full; he\nshould be left in control of his own property and that of his wife;\nall his belongings and his inherited property should belong to his\ncreditors, and he should administer his affairs in their interests\nunder supervision; he should still carry on his business, signing always\n'So-and-so, insolvent,' until the whole debt is paid off. If bankrupt,\nhe should be condemned, as formerly, to the pillory on the Place de la\nBourse, and exposed for two hours, wearing a green cap. His property and\nthat of his wife, and all his rights of every kind should be handed over\nto his creditors, and he himself banished from the kingdom.\"\n\n\"Business would be more secure,\" said Lourdois; \"people would think\ntwice before launching into speculations.\"\n\n\"The existing laws are not enforced,\" cried Cesar, lashing himself up.\n\"Out of every hundred merchants there are more than fifty who never\nrealize seventy-five per cent of the whole value of their business, or\nwho sell their merchandise at twenty-five per cent below the invoice\nprice; and that is the destruction of commerce.\"\n\n\"Monsieur is very right,\" said Molineux; \"the law leaves a great deal\ntoo much latitude. There should either be total relinquishment of\neverything, or infamy.\"\n\n\"Damn it!\" said Cesar, \"at the rate things are going now, a merchant\nwill soon be a licensed thief. With his mere signature he can dip into\nanybody's money-drawer.\"\n\n\"You have no mercy, Monsieur Birotteau,\" said Lourdois.\n\n\"He is quite right,\" said old Ragon.\n\n\"All insolvents are suspicious characters,\" said Cesar, exasperated by\nhis little loss, which sounded in his ears like the first cry of the\nview-halloo in the ears of the game.\n\nAt this moment the late major-domo brought in Chevet's account, followed\nby a clerk sent by Felix, a waiter from the cafe Foy, and Collinet's\nclarionet, each with a bill.\n\n\"Rabelais' quarter of an hour,\" said Ragon, smiling.\n\n\"It was a fine ball,\" said Lourdois.\n\n\"I am busy,\" said Cesar to the messengers; who all left the bills and\nwent away.\n\n\"Monsieur Grindot,\" said Lourdois, observing that the architect was\nfolding up Birotteau's cheque, \"will you certify my account? You need\nonly to add it up; the prices were all agreed to by you on Monsieur\nBirotteau's behalf.\"\n\nPillerault looked at Lourdois and Grindot.\n\n\"Prices agreed upon between the architect and contractor?\" he said in a\nlow voice to his nephew,--\"they have robbed you.\"\n\nGrindot left the shop, and Molineux followed him with a mysterious air.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"you listened to me, but you did not understand\nme,--I wish you the protection of an umbrella.\"\n\nThe architect was frightened. The more illegal a man's gains the more he\nclings to them: the human heart is so made. Grindot had really studied\nthe appartement lovingly; he had put all his art and all his time into\nit; he had given ten thousand francs worth of labor, and he felt that in\nso doing he had been the dupe of his vanity: the contractors therefore\nhad little trouble in seducing him. The irresistible argument and\nthreat, fully understood, of injuring him professionally by calumniating\nhis work were, however, less powerful than a remark made by Lourdois\nabout the lands near the Madeleine. Birotteau did not expect to hold\na single house upon them; he was speculating only on the value of the\nland; but architects and contractors are to each other very much\nwhat authors and actors are,--mutually dependent. Grindot, ordered by\nBirotteau to stipulate the costs, went for the interests of the\nbuilders against the bourgeoisie; and the result was that three large\ncontractors--Lourdois, Chaffaroux, and Thorein the carpenter--proclaimed\nhim \"one of those good fellows it is a pleasure to work for.\" Grindot\nguessed that the contractor's bills, out of which he was to have a\nshare, would be paid, like his commission, in notes; and little Molineux\nhad just filled his mind with doubts as to their payment. The architect\nwas about to become pitiless,--after the manner of artists, who are most\nintolerant of men in their dealings with the middle classes.\n\nBy the end of December bills to the amount of sixty thousand francs had\nbeen sent in. Felix, the cafe Foy, Tanrade, and all the little creditors\nwho ought to be paid in ready money, had asked for payment three times.\nFailure to pay such trifles as these do more harm in business than a\nreal misfortune,--they foretell it: known losses are definite, but a\npanic defies all reckoning. Birotteau saw his coffers empty, and\nterror seized him: such a thing had never happened throughout his whole\ncommercial life. Like all persons who have never struggled long with\npoverty, and who are by nature feeble, this circumstance, so common\namong the greater number of the petty Parisian tradesmen, disturbed for\na moment Cesar's brain. He ordered Celestin to send round the bills of\nhis customers and ask for payment. Before doing so, the head clerk made\nhim repeat the unheard-of order. The clients,--a fine term applied by\nretail shopkeepers to their customers, and used by Cesar in spite of his\nwife, who however ended by saying, \"Call them what you like, provided\nthey pay!\"--his clients, then, were rich people, through whom he had\nnever lost money, who paid when they pleased, and among whom Cesar often\nhad a floating amount of fifty or sixty thousand francs due to him. The\nsecond clerk went through the books and copied off the largest sums.\nCesar dreaded his wife: that she might not see his depression under this\nsimoom of misfortune, he prepared to go out.\n\n\"Good morning, monsieur,\" said Grindot, entering with the lively manner\nartists put on when they speak of business, and wish to pretend they\nknow nothing about it; \"I cannot get your paper cashed, and I am obliged\nto ask you to give me the amount in ready money. I am truly unhappy in\nmaking this request, but I don't wish to go to the usurers. I have not\nhawked your signature about; I know enough of business to feel sure it\nwould injure you. It is really in your own interest that I--\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Birotteau, horrified, \"speak lower if you please; you\nsurprise me strangely.\"\n\nLourdois entered.\n\n\"Lourdois,\" said Birotteau, smiling, \"would you believe--\"\n\nThe poor man stopped short; he was about to ask the painter to take the\nnote given to Grindot, ridiculing the architect with the good nature of\na merchant sure of his own standing; but he saw a cloud upon Lourdois'\nbrow, and he shuddered at his own imprudence. The innocent jest would\nhave been the death of his suspected credit. In such a case a prosperous\nmerchant takes back his note, and does not offer it elsewhere. Birotteau\nfelt his head swim, as though he had looked down the sides of a\nprecipice into a measureless abyss.\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Birotteau,\" said Lourdois, drawing him to the back of\nthe shop, \"my account has been examined, audited, and certified; I must\nask you to have the money ready for me to-morrow. I marry my daughter\nto little Crottat; he wants money, for notaries will not take paper;\nbesides, I never give promissory notes.\"\n\n\"Send to me on the day after to-morrow,\" said Birotteau proudly,\ncounting on the payment of his own bills. \"And you too, Monsieur,\" he\nsaid to the architect.\n\n\"Why not pay at once?\" said Grindot.\n\n\"I have my workmen in the faubourg to pay,\" said Birotteau, who knew not\nhow to lie.\n\nHe took his hat once more intending to follow them out, but the mason,\nThorein, and Chaffaroux stopped him as he was closing the door.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Chaffaroux, \"we are in great need of money.\"\n\n\"Well, I have not the mines of Peru,\" said Cesar, walking quickly away\nfrom them. \"There is something beneath all this,\" he said to himself.\n\"That cursed ball! All the world thinks I am worth millions. Yet\nLourdois had a look that was not natural; there's a snake in the grass\nsomewhere.\"\n\nHe walked along the Rue Saint-Honore, in no special direction, and\nfeeling much discomposed. At the corner of a street he ran against\nAlexandre Crottat, just as a ram, or a mathematician absorbed in the\nsolution of a problem, might have knocked against another of his kind.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said the future notary, \"one word! Has Roguin given your\nfour hundred thousand francs to Monsieur Claparon?\"\n\n\"The business was settled in your presence. Monsieur Claparon gave me\nno receipt; my acceptances were to be--negotiated. Roguin was to give\nhim--my two hundred and forty thousand francs. He was told that he was\nto pay for the property definitely. Monsieur Popinot the judge said--The\nreceipt!--but--why do you ask the question?\"\n\n\"Why ask the question? To know if your two hundred and forty thousand\nfrancs are still with Roguin. Roguin was so long connected with you,\nthat perhaps out of decent feeling he may have paid them over to\nClaparon, and you will escape! But, no! what a fool I am! He has carried\noff Claparon's money as well! Happily, Claparon had only paid over, to\nmy care, one hundred thousand francs. I gave them to Roguin just as I\nwould give you my purse, and I have no receipt for them. The owners of\nthe land have not received one penny; they have just been talking to me.\nThe money you thought you raised upon your property in the Faubourg du\nTemple had no existence for you, or the borrower; Roguin has squandered\nit, together with your hundred thousand francs, which he used up long\nago,--and your last hundred thousand as well, for I just remember\ndrawing them from the bank.\"\n\nThe pupils of Cesar's eyes dilated so enormously that he saw only red\nflames.\n\n\"Your hundred thousand francs in his hands, my hundred thousand for\nhis practice, a hundred thousand from Claparon,--there's three hundred\nthousand francs purloined, not to speak of other thefts which will be\ndiscovered,\" exclaimed the young notary. \"Madame Roguin is not to be\ncounted on. Du Tillet has had a narrow escape. Roguin tormented him for\na month to get into that land speculation, but happily all his funds\nwere tied up in an affair with Nucingen. Roguin has written an atrocious\nletter to his wife; I have read it. He has been making free with\nhis clients' money for years; and why? for a mistress,--la belle\nHollandaise. He left her two weeks ago. The squandering hussy hasn't\na farthing left; they sold her furniture,--she had signed promissory\nnotes. To escape arrest, she took refuge in a house in the Palais-Royal,\nwhere she was assassinated last night by a captain in the army. God has\nquickly punished her; she has wasted Roguin's whole fortune and\nmuch more. There are some women to whom nothing is sacred: think of\nsquandering the trust moneys of a notary! Madame Roguin won't have a\npenny, except by claiming her rights of dower; the scoundrel's whole\nproperty is encumbered to its full value. I bought the practice for\nthree hundred thousand francs,--I, who thought I was getting a good\nthing!--and paid a hundred thousand down. I have no receipt; the\ncreditors will think I am an accomplice if I say a word about that\nhundred thousand francs, and when a man is starting in life he must be\ncareful of his reputation. There will hardly be thirty per cent saved\nfor the creditors. At my age, to get such a set-back! A man fifty-nine\nyears of age to keep a mistress! the old villain! It is only two weeks\nsince he told me not to marry Cesarine; he said you would soon be\nwithout bread,--the monster!\"\n\nAlexandre might have talked on indefinitely, for Birotteau stood still,\npetrified. Every phrase was a calamity, like the blows of a bludgeon. He\nheard the death-bells tolling in his ears,--just as his eyes had seen,\nat the first word, the flames of his fortune. Alexandre Crottat, who\nthought the worthy perfumer a strong and able man, was alarmed at his\npaleness and rigidity. He was not aware that Roguin had carried off\nCesar's whole property. The thought of immediate suicide passed through\nthe brain of the victim, deeply religious as he was. In such a case\nsuicide is only a way to escape a thousand deaths; it seems logical to\ntake it. Alexandre Crottat gave him his arm, and tried to make him walk\non, but it was impossible: his legs gave way under him as if he were\ndrunk.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Crottat. \"Dear Monsieur Cesar, take courage!\nit is not the death of a man. Besides, you will get back your forty\nthousand francs. The lender hadn't the money ready, you never received\nit,--that is sufficient to set aside the agreement.\"\n\n\"My ball--my cross--two hundred thousand francs in paper on the\nmarket,--no money in hand! The Ragons, Pillerault,--and my wife, who saw\ntrue--\"\n\nA rain of confused words, revealing a weight of crushing thoughts and\nunutterable suffering, poured from his lips, like hail lashing the\nflowers in the garden of \"The Queen of Roses.\"\n\n\"I wish they would cut off my head,\" he said at last; \"its weight\ntroubles me, it is good for nothing.\"\n\n\"Poor Pere Birotteau,\" said Alexandre, \"are you in danger?\"\n\n\"Danger!\"\n\n\"Well, take courage; make an effort.\"\n\n\"Effort!\"\n\n\"Du Tillet was your clerk; he has a good head; he will help you.\"\n\n\"Du Tillet!\"\n\n\"Come, try to walk.\"\n\n\"My God! I cannot go home as I am,\" said Birotteau. \"You who are my\nfriend, if there are friends,--you in whom I took an interest, who have\ndined at my house,--take me somewhere in a carriage, for my wife's sake.\nXandrot, go with me!\"\n\nThe young notary compassionately put the inert mechanism which bore the\nname of Cesar into a street coach, not without great difficulty.\n\n\"Xandrot,\" said the perfumer, in a voice choked with tears,--for the\ntears were now falling from his eyes, and loosening the iron band which\nbound his brow,--\"stop at my shop; go in and speak to Celestin for\nme. My friend, tell him it is a matter of life or death, that on no\nconsideration must he or any one talk about Roguin's flight. Tell\nCesarine to come down to me, and beg her not to say a word to her\nmother. We must beware of our best friends, of Pillerault, Ragon,\neverybody.\"\n\nThe change in Birotteau's voice startled Crottat, who began to\nunderstand the importance of the warning; he fulfilled the instructions\nof the poor man, whom Celestin and Cesarine were horrified to find pale\nand half insensible in a corner of the carriage.\n\n\"Keep the secret,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Xandrot to himself, \"he is coming to. I thought him lost.\"\n\nFrom thence they went, at Cesar's request, to a judge of the commercial\ncourts. The conference between Crottat and the magistrate lasted long,\nand the president of the chamber of notaries was summoned. Cesar was\ncarried about from place to place, like a bale of goods; he never moved,\nand said nothing. Towards seven in the evening Alexandre Crottat took\nhim home. The thought of appearing before Constance braced his nerves.\nThe young notary had the charity to go before, and warn Madame Birotteau\nthat her husband had had a rush of blood to the head.\n\n\"His ideas are rather cloudy,\" he said, with a gesture implying\ndisturbance of the brain. \"Perhaps he should be bled, or leeches\napplied.\"\n\n\"No wonder,\" said Constance, far from dreaming of a disaster; \"he did\nnot take his precautionary medicine at the beginning of the winter, and\nfor the last two months he has been working like a galley slave,--just\nas if his fortune were not made.\"\n\nThe wife and daughter entreated Cesar to go to bed, and they sent for\nhis old friend Monsieur Haudry. The old man was a physician of\nthe school of Moliere, a great practitioner and in favor of the\nold-fashioned formulas, who dosed his patients neither more nor less\nthan a quack, consulting physician though he was. He came, studied\nthe expression of Cesar's face, and observing symptoms of cerebral\ncongestion, ordered an immediate application of mustard plasters to the\nsoles of his feet.\n\n\"What can have caused it?\" asked Constance.\n\n\"The damp weather,\" said the doctor, to whom Cesarine had given a hint.\n\nIt often becomes a physician's duty to utter deliberately some silly\nfalsehood, to save honor or life, to those who are about a sick-bed. The\nold doctor had seen much in his day, and he caught the meaning of half\na word. Cesarine followed him to the staircase, and asked for directions\nin managing the case.\n\n\"Quiet and silence; when the head is clear we will try tonics.\"\n\nMadame Cesar passed two days at the bedside of her husband, who seemed\nto her at times delirious. He lay in her beautiful blue room, and as he\nlooked at the curtains, the furniture, and all the costly magnificence\nabout him, he said things that were wholly incomprehensible to her.\n\n\"He must be out of his mind,\" she whispered to Cesarine, as Cesar rose\nup in bed and recited clauses of the commercial Code in a solemn voice.\n\n\"'If the expenditure is judged excessive!' Away with those curtains!\"\n\nAt the end of three terrible days, during which his reason was in\ndanger, the strong constitution of the Tourangian peasant triumphed; his\nhead grew clear. Monsieur Haudry ordered stimulants and generous diet,\nand before long, after an occasional cup of coffee, Cesar was on his\nfeet again. Constance, wearied out, took her husband's place in bed.\n\n\"Poor woman!\" said Cesar, looking at her as she slept.\n\n\"Come, papa, take courage! you are so superior a man that you will\ntriumph in the end. This trouble won't last; Monsieur Anselme will help\nyou.\"\n\nCesarine said these vague words in the tender tones which give courage\nto a stricken heart, just as the songs of a mother soothe the weary\nchild tormented with pain as its cuts its teeth.\n\n\"Yes, my child, I shall struggle on; but say not a word to any one,--not\nto Popinot who loves us, nor to your uncle Pillerault. I shall first\nwrite to my brother; he is canon and vicar of the cathedral. He spends\nnothing, and I have no doubt he has means. If he saves only three\nthousand francs a year, that would give him at the end of twenty years\none hundred thousand francs. In the provinces the priests lay up money.\"\n\nCesarine hastened to bring her father a little table with writing-things\nupon it,--among them the surplus of invitations printed on pink paper.\n\n\"Burn all that!\" cried her father. \"The devil alone could have prompted\nme to give that ball. If I fail, I shall seem to have been a swindler.\nStop!\" he added, \"words are of no avail.\" And he wrote the following\nletter:--\n\n\n  My dear Brother,--I find myself in so severe a commercial crisis\n  that I must ask you to send me all the money you can dispose of,\n  even if you have to borrow some for the purpose.\n\n                                                Ever yours,\n                                                         Cesar.\n\n  Your niece, Cesarine, who is watching me as I write, while my poor\n  wife sleeps, sends you her tender remembrances.\n\n\nThis postscript was added at Cesarine's urgent request; she then took\nthe letter and gave it to Raguet.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, returning, \"here is Monsieur Lebas, who wants to\nspeak to you.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Lebas!\" cried Cesar, frightened, as though his disaster had\nmade him a criminal,--\"a judge!\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Birotteau, I take too great an interest in you,\"\nsaid the stout draper, entering the room, \"we have known each other too\nlong,--for we were both elected judges at the same time,--not to tell\nyou that a man named Bidault, called Gigonnet, a usurer, has notes of\nyours turned over to his order, and marked 'not guaranteed,' by the\nhouse of Claparon. Those words are not only an affront, but they are the\ndeath of your credit.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Claparon wishes to speak to you,\" said Celestin, entering;\n\"may I tell him to come up?\"\n\n\"Now we shall learn the meaning of this insult,\" said Lebas.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Cesar to Claparon, as he entered, \"this is Monsieur\nLebas, a judge of the commercial courts, and my friend--\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur is Monsieur Lebas?\" interrupted Claparon. \"Delighted with\nthe opportunity, Monsieur Lebas of the commercial courts; there are so\nmany Lebas, you know, of one kind or another--\"\n\n\"He has seen,\" said Birotteau, cutting the gabbler short, \"the notes\nwhich I gave you, and which I understood from you would not be put into\ncirculation. He has seen them bearing the words 'not guaranteed.'\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Claparon, \"they are not in general circulation; they are\nin the hands of a man with whom I do a great deal of business,--Pere\nBidault. That is why I affixed the words 'not guaranteed.' If the notes\nwere intended for circulation you would have made them payable to his\norder. Monsieur Lebas will understand my position. What do these notes\nrepresent? The price of landed property. Paid by whom? By Birotteau. Why\nshould I guarantee Birotteau by my signature? We are to pay, each on his\nown account, our half of the price of the said land. Now, it is enough\nto be jointly and separately liable to the sellers. I hold inflexibly to\none commercial rule: I never give my guarantee uselessly, any more than\nI give my receipt for moneys not yet paid. He who signs, pays. I don't\nwish to be liable to pay three times.\"\n\n\"Three times!\" said Cesar.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Claparon, \"I have already guaranteed Birotteau\nto the sellers, why should I guarantee him again to the bankers? The\ncircumstances in which we are placed are very hard. Roguin has carried\noff a hundred thousand francs of mine; therefore, my half of the\nproperty costs me five hundred thousand francs instead of four hundred\nthousand. Roguin has also carried off two hundred and forty thousand\nfrancs of Birotteau's. What would you do in my place, Monsieur Lebas?\nStand in my skin for a moment and view the case. Give me your attention.\nSay that we are engaged in a transaction on equal shares; you provide\nthe money for your share, I give bills for mine; I offer them to you,\nand you undertake, purely out of kindness, to convert them into money.\nYou learn that I, Claparon,--banker, rich, respected (I accept all the\nvirtues under the sun),--that the virtuous Claparon is on the verge of\nfailure, with six million of liabilities to meet: would you, at such a\nmoment, give your signature to guarantee mine? Of course not; you would\nbe mad to do it. Well, Monsieur Lebas, Birotteau is in the position\nwhich I have supposed for Claparon. Don't you see that if I endorse for\nhim I am liable not only for my own share of the purchase, but I shall\nalso be compelled to reimburse to the full amount of Birotteau's paper,\nand without--\"\n\n\"To whom?\" asked Birotteau, interrupting him.\n\n\"--without gaining his half of the property?\" said Claparon, paying no\nattention to the interruption. \"For I should have no rights in it; I\nshould have to buy it over again; consequently, I repeat, I should have\nto pay for it three times.\"\n\n\"Reimburse whom?\" persisted Birotteau.\n\n\"Why, the holder of the notes, if I were to endorse, and you were to\nfail.\"\n\n\"I shall not fail, monsieur,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Claparon. \"But you have been a judge, and you are\na clever merchant; you know very well that we should look ahead and\nforesee everything; you can't be surprised that I should attend to my\nbusiness properly.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Claparon is right,\" said Joseph Lebas.\n\n\"I am right,\" said Claparon,--\"right commercially. But this is an affair\nof landed property. Now, what must I have? Money, to pay the sellers. We\nwon't speak now of the two hundred and forty thousand francs,--which I\nam sure Monsieur Birotteau will be able to raise soon,\" said Claparon,\nlooking at Lebas. \"I have come now to ask for a trifle, merely\ntwenty-five thousand francs,\" he added, turning to Birotteau.\n\n\"Twenty-five thousand francs!\" cried Cesar, feeling ice in his veins\ninstead of blood. \"What claim have you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"What claim? Hey! we have to make a payment and execute the deeds before\na notary. Among ourselves, of course, we could come to an understanding\nabout the payment, but when we have to do with a financial public\nfunctionary it is quite another thing! He won't palaver; he'll trust you\nno farther than he can see. We have got to come down with forty\nthousand francs, to secure the registration, this week. I did not expect\nreproaches in coming here, for, thinking this twenty-five thousand\nfrancs might be inconvenient to you just now, I meant to tell you that,\nby a mere chance, I have saved you--\"\n\n\"What?\" said Birotteau, with that rending cry of anguish which no man\never mistakes.\n\n\"A trifle! The notes amounting to twenty-five thousand francs on divers\nsecurities which Roguin gave me to negotiate I have credited to you,\nfor the registration payment and the fees, of which I will send you an\naccount; there will be a small amount to deduct, and you will then owe\nme about six or seven thousand francs.\"\n\n\"All that seems to me perfectly proper,\" said Lebas. \"In your place,\nmonsieur, I should do the same towards a stranger.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Birotteau won't die of it,\" said Claparon; \"it takes more than\none shot to kill an old wolf. I have seen wolves with a ball in their\nhead run, by God, like--wolves!\"\n\n\"Who could have foreseen such villany as Roguin's?\" said Lebas, as\nmuch alarmed by Cesar's silence as by the discovery of such enormous\nspeculations outside of his friend's legitimate business of perfumery.\n\n\"I came very near giving Monsieur Birotteau a receipt for his four\nhundred thousand francs,\" said Claparon. \"I should have blown up if I\nhad, for I had given Roguin a hundred thousand myself the day before.\nOur mutual confidence is all that saved me. Whether the money were in a\nlawyer's hands or in mine until the day came to pay for the land, seemed\nto us all a matter of no importance.\"\n\n\"It would have been better,\" said Lebas, \"to have kept the money in the\nBank of France until the time came to make the payments.\"\n\n\"Roguin was the bank to me,\" said Cesar. \"But he is in the speculation,\"\nhe added, looking at Claparon.\n\n\"Yes, for one-fourth, by verbal agreement only. After being such a fool\nas to let him run off with my money, I sha'n't be such a fool as to\nthrow any more after it. If he sends me my hundred thousand francs, and\ntwo hundred thousand more for his half of our share, I shall then see\nabout it. But he will take good care not to send them for an affair\nwhich needs five years' pot-boiling before you get any broth. If he has\nonly carried off, as they say, three hundred thousand francs, he will\nwant the income of all of that to live suitably in foreign countries.\"\n\n\"The villain!\"\n\n\"Eh! the devil take him! It was a woman who got him where he is,\" said\nClaparon. \"Where's the old man who can answer for himself that he won't\nbe the slave of his last fancy? None of us, who think ourselves so\nvirtuous, know how we shall end. A last passion,--eh! it is the most\nviolent of all! Look at Cardot, Camusot, Matifat; they all have their\nmistresses! If we have been gobbled up to satisfy Roguin's, isn't it\nour own fault? Why didn't we distrust a notary who meddles with\nspeculations? Every notary, every broker, every trustee who speculates\nis an object of suspicion. Failure for them is fraudulent bankruptcy;\nthey are sure to go before the criminal courts, and therefore they\nprefer to run out of the country. I sha'n't commit such a stupid blunder\nagain. Well, well! we are too shaky ourselves in the matter not to let\njudgment go by default against the men we have dined with, who have\ngiven us fine balls,--men of the world, in short. Nobody complains; we\nare all to blame.\"\n\n\"Very much to blame,\" said Birotteau. \"The laws about failures and\ninsolvency should be looked into.\"\n\n\"If you have any need of me,\" said Lebas to Cesar, \"I am at your\nservice.\"\n\n\"Monsieur does not need any one,\" said the irrepressible chatterbox,\nwhose floodgates du Tillet had set wide open when he turned on the\nwater,--for Claparon was now repeating a lesson du Tillet had cleverly\ntaught him. \"His course is quite clear. Roguin's assets will give fifty\nper cent to the creditors, so little Crottat tells me. Besides this,\nMonsieur Birotteau gets back the forty thousand on his note to Roguin's\nclient, which the lender never paid over; then, of course, he can borrow\non that property. We have four months ahead before we are obliged to\nmake a payment of two hundred thousand francs to the sellers. Between\nnow and then, Monsieur Birotteau can pay off his notes; though of course\nhe can't count on what Roguin has carried off to meet them. Even if\nMonsieur Birotteau should be rather pinched, with a little manipulation\nhe will come out all right.\"\n\nThe poor man took courage, as he heard Claparon analyzing the affair and\nsumming it up with advice as to his future conduct. His countenance grew\nfirm and decided; and he began to think highly of the late commercial\ntraveller's capacity. Du Tillet had thought best to let Claparon believe\nhimself really the victim of Roguin. He had given Claparon a hundred\nthousand francs to pay over to Roguin the day before the latter's\nflight, and Roguin had returned the money to du Tillet. Claparon,\ntherefore, to that extent was playing a genuine part; and he told\nwhoever would listen to him that Roguin had cost him a hundred thousand\nfrancs. Du Tillet thought Claparon was not bold enough, and fancied he\nhad still too much honor and decency to make it safe to trust him with\nthe full extent of his plans; and he knew him to be mentally incapable\nof conjecturing them.\n\n\"If our first friend is not our first dupe, we shall never find a\nsecond,\" he made answer to Claparon, on the day when his catchpenny\nbanker reproached him for the trick; and he flung him away like a\nwornout instrument.\n\nMonsieur Lebas and Claparon went out together.\n\n\"I shall pull through,\" said Birotteau to himself. \"My liabilities\namount to two hundred and thirty-five thousand francs; that is,\nsixty-five thousand in bills for the cost of the ball, and a hundred\nand seventy-five thousand given in notes for the lands. To meet these,\nI have my share of Roguin's assets, say perhaps one hundred thousand\nfrancs; and I can cancel the loan on my property in the Faubourg du\nTemple, as the mortgage never paid the money,--in all, one hundred and\nforty thousand. All depends on making a hundred thousand francs out of\nCephalic Oil, and waiting patiently, with the help of a few notes, or\na credit at a banker's, until I repair my losses or the lands about the\nMadeleine reach their full value.\"\n\nWhen a man crushed by misfortune is once able to make the fiction of a\nhope for himself by a series of arguments, more or less reasonable, with\nwhich he bolsters himself up to rest his head, it often happens that he\nis really saved. Many a man has derived energy from the confidence born\nof illusions. Possibly, hope is the better half of courage; indeed,\nthe Catholic religion makes it a virtue. Hope! has it not sustained\nthe weak, and given the fainting heart time and patience to await the\nchances and changes of life? Cesar resolved to confide his situation to\nhis wife's uncle before seeking for succor elsewhere. But as he walked\ndown the Rue Saint-Honore towards the Rue des Bourdonnais, he endured an\ninward anguish and distress which shook him so violently that he\nfancied his health was giving way. His bowels seemed on fire. It is an\nestablished fact that persons who feel through their diaphragms suffer\nin those parts when overtaken by misfortune, just as others whose\nperceptions are in their heads suffer from cerebral pains and\naffections. In great crises, the physical powers are attacked at the\npoint where the individual temperament has placed the vital spark.\nFeeble beings have the colic. Napoleon slept. Before assailing the\nconfidence of a life-long friendship, and breaking down all the barriers\nof pride and self-assurance, an honorable man must needs feel in\nhis heart--and feel it more than once--the spur of that cruel rider,\nnecessity. Thus it happened that Birotteau had been goaded for two days\nbefore he could bring himself to seek his uncle; it was, indeed, only\nfamily reasons which finally decided him to do so. In any state of\nthe case, it was his duty to explain his position to the severe old\nironmonger, his wife's uncle. Nevertheless, as he reached the house\nhe felt that inward faintness which a child feels when taken to a\ndentist's; but this shrinking of the heart involved the whole of his\nlife, past, present, and to come,--it was not the fugitive pain of a\nmoment. He went slowly up the stairs.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe old man was reading the \"Constitutionnel\" in his chimney-corner,\nbefore a little round table on which stood his frugal breakfast,--a\nroll, some butter, a plate of Brie cheese, and a cup of coffee.\n\n\"Here is true wisdom,\" thought Birotteau, envying his uncle's life.\n\n\"Well!\" said Pillerault, taking off his spectacles, \"I heard at the cafe\nDavid last night about Roguin's affair, and the assassination of his\nmistress, la belle Hollandaise. I hope, as we desire to be actual owners\nof the property, that you obtained Claparon's receipt for the money.\"\n\n\"Alas! uncle, no. The trouble is just there,--you have put your finger\nupon the sore.\"\n\n\"Good God! you are ruined!\" cried Pillerault, letting fall\nhis newspaper, which Birotteau picked up, though it was the\n\"Constitutionnel.\"\n\nPillerault was so violently roused by his reflections that his\nface--like the image on a medal and of the same stern character--took a\ndeep bronze tone, such as the metal itself takes under the oscillating\ntool of a coiner; he remained motionless, gazing through the\nwindow-panes at the opposite wall, but seeing nothing,--listening,\nhowever, to Birotteau. Evidently he heard and judged, and weighed the\n_pros_ and _cons_ with the inflexibility of a Minos who had crossed the\nStyx of commerce when he quitted the Quai des Morfondus for his little\nthird storey.\n\n\"Well, uncle?\" said Birotteau, who waited for an answer, after closing\nwhat he had to say with an entreaty that Pillerault would sell sixty\nthousand francs out of the Funds.\n\n\"Well, my poor nephew, I cannot do it; you are too heavily involved. The\nRagons and I each lose our fifty thousand francs. Those worthy people\nhave, by my advice, sold their shares in the mines of Wortschin: I feel\nobliged, in case of loss, not to return the capital of course, but\nto succor them, and to succor my niece and Cesarine. You may all want\nbread, and you shall find it with me.\"\n\n\"Want bread, uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes, bread. See things as they are, Cesar. _You cannot extricate\nyourself._ With five thousand six hundred francs income, I could\nset aside four thousand francs for you and the Ragons. If misfortune\novertakes you,--I know Constance, she will work herself to the bone, she\nwill deny herself everything; and so will you, Cesar.\"\n\n\"All is not hopeless, uncle.\"\n\n\"I cannot see it as you do.\"\n\n\"I will prove that you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"Nothing would give me greater happiness.\"\n\nBirotteau left Pillerault without another word. He had come to seek\ncourage and consolation, and he received a blow less severe, perhaps,\nthan the first; but instead of striking his head it struck his heart,\nand his heart was the whole of life to the poor man. After going down a\nfew stairs he returned.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, in a cold voice, \"Constance knows nothing. Keep my\nsecret at any rate; beg the Ragons to say nothing, and not to take from\nmy home the peace I need so much in my struggle against misfortune.\"\n\nPillerault made a gesture of assent.\n\n\"Courage, Cesar!\" he said. \"I see you are angry with me; but later, when\nyou think of your wife and daughter, you will do me justice.\"\n\nDiscouraged by his uncle's opinion, and recognizing its\nclear-sightedness, Cesar tumbled from the heights of hope into the miry\nmarshes of doubt and uncertainty. In such horrible commercial straits\na man, unless his soul is tempered like that of Pillerault, becomes the\nplaything of events; he follows the ideas of others, or his own, as a\ntraveller pursues a will-o'-the-wisp. He lets the gust whirl him along,\ninstead of lying flat and not looking up as it passes; or else gathering\nhimself together to follow the direction of the storm till he can escape\nfrom the edges of it. In the midst of his pain Birotteau bethought him\nof the steps he ought to take about the mortgage on his property. He\nturned towards the Rue Vivienne to find Derville, his solicitor, and\ninstitute proceedings at once, in case the lawyer should see any chance\nof annulling the agreement. He found Derville sitting by the fire,\nwrapped in a white woollen dressing-gown, calm and composed in manner,\nlike all lawyers long used to receiving terrible confidences. Birotteau\nnoticed for the first time in his life this necessary coldness, which\nstruck a chill to the soul of a man grasped by the fever of imperilled\ninterests,--passionate, wounded, and cruelly gashed in his life, his\nhonor, his wife, his child, as Cesar showed himself to be while he\nrelated his misfortunes.\n\n\"If it can be proved,\" said Derville, after listening to him, \"that the\nlender no longer had in Roguin's hands the sum which Roguin pretended to\nborrow for you upon your property, then, as there has been no delivery\nof the money, there is ground for annulling the contract; the lender may\nseek redress through the warranty, as you will for your hundred thousand\nfrancs. I will answer for the case, however, as much as one can ever\nanswer. No case is won till it is tried.\"\n\nThe opinion of so able a lawyer restored Cesar's courage a little,\nand he begged Derville to obtain a judgment within a fortnight. The\nsolicitor replied that it might take three months to get such a judgment\nas would annul the agreement.\n\n\"Three months!\" cried Birotteau, who needed immediate resources.\n\n\"Though we may get the case at once on the docket, we cannot make your\nadversary keep pace with us. He will employ all the law's delays, and\nthe barristers are seldom ready. Perhaps your opponents will let the\ncase go by default. We can't always get on as we wish,\" said Derville,\nsmiling.\n\n\"In the commercial courts--\" began Birotteau.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the lawyer, \"the judges of the commercial courts and the\njudges of the civil courts are different sorts of judges. You dash\nthrough things. At the Palais de Justice we have stricter forms. Forms\nare the bulwarks of law. How would you like slap-dash judgments, which\ncan't be appealed, and which would make you lose forty thousand francs?\nWell, your adversary, who sees that sum involved, will defend himself.\nDelays may be called judicial fortifications.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Birotteau, bidding Derville good-by, and going\nhurriedly away, with death in his heart.\n\n\"They are all right. Money! money! I must have money!\" he cried as he\nwent along the streets, talking to himself like other busy men in the\nturbulent and seething city, which a modern poet has called a vat. When\nhe entered his shop, the clerk who had carried round the bills informed\nhim that the customers had returned the receipts and kept the accounts,\nas it was so near the first of January.\n\n\"Then there is no money to be had anywhere,\" said the perfumer, aloud.\n\nHe bit his lips, for the clerks all raised their heads and looked at\nhim.\n\nFive days went by; five days during which Braschon, Lourdois, Thorein,\nGrindot, Chaffaroux, and all the other creditors with unpaid bills\npassed through the chameleon phases that are customary to uneasy\ncreditors before they take the sanguinary colors of the commercial\nBellona, and reach a state of peaceful confidence. In Paris the\nastringent stage of suspicion and mistrust is as quick to declare\nitself as the expansive flow of confidence is slow in gathering way. The\ncreditor who has once turned into the narrow path of commercial fears\nand precautions speedily takes a course of malignant meanness which puts\nhim below the level of his debtor. He passes from specious civility\nto impatient rage, to the surly clamor of importunity, to bursts of\ndisappointment, to the livid coldness of a mind made up to vengeance,\nand the scowling insolence of a summons before the courts. Braschon, the\nrich upholsterer of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, who was not invited\nto the ball, and was therefore stabbed in his self-love, sounded the\ncharge; he insisted on being paid within twenty-four hours. He demanded\nsecurity; not an attachment on the furniture, but a second mortgage on\nthe property in the Faubourg du Temple.\n\nIn spite of such attacks and the violence of these recriminations, a\nfew peaceful intervals occurred, when Birotteau breathed once more; but\ninstead of resolutely facing and vanquishing the first skirmishings of\nadverse fortune, Cesar employed his whole mind in the effort to keep his\nwife, the only person able to advise him, from knowing anything about\nthem. He guarded the very threshold of his door, and set a watch on\nall around him. He took Celestin into confidence so far as to admit a\nmomentary embarrassment, and Celestin examined him with an amazed and\ninquisitive look. In his eyes Cesar lessened, as men lessen in presence\nof disasters when accustomed only to success, and when their whole\nmental strength consists of knowledge which commonplace minds acquire\nthrough routine.\n\nMenaced as he was on so many sides at once, and without the energy or\ncapacity to defend himself, Cesar nevertheless had the courage to look\nhis position in the face. To meet the payments on his house and on\nhis loans, and to pay his rents and his current expenses, he required,\nbetween the end of December and the fifteenth of January, a sum of sixty\nthousand francs, half of which must be obtained before the thirtieth\nof December. All his resources put together gave him a scant twenty\nthousand; he lacked ten thousand francs for the first payments. To his\nmind the position did not seem desperate; for like an adventurer who\nlives from day to day, he saw only the present moment. He resolved to\nattempt, before the news of his embarrassments was made public, what\nseemed to him a great stroke, and seek out the famous Francois Keller,\nbanker, orator, and philanthropist, celebrated for his benevolence and\nfor his desire to serve the interests of Parisian commerce,--with the\nview, we may add, of being always returned to the Chamber as a deputy of\nParis.\n\nThe banker was Liberal, Birotteau was Royalist; but the perfumer judged\nby his own heart, and believed that the difference in their political\nopinions would only be one reason the more for obtaining the credit\nhe intended to ask. In case actual securities were required he felt no\ndoubt of Popinot's devotion, from whom he expected to obtain some thirty\nthousand francs, which would enable him to await the result of\nhis law-suit by satisfying the demands of the most exacting of the\ncreditors. The demonstrative perfumer, who told his dear Constance, with\nhis head on her pillow, the smallest thoughts and feelings of his whole\nlife, looking for the lights of her contradiction, and gathering courage\nas he did so, was now prevented from speaking of his situation to his\nhead-clerk, his uncle, or his wife. His thoughts were therefore doubly\nheavy,--and yet the generous martyr preferred to suffer, rather than\nfling the fiery brand into the soul of his wife. He meant to tell her\nof the danger when it was over. The awe with which she inspired him gave\nhim courage. He went every morning to hear Mass at Saint-Roch, and took\nGod for his confidant.\n\n\"If I do not meet a soldier coming home from Saint-Roch, my request\nwill be granted. That will be God's answer,\" he said to himself, after\npraying that God would help him.\n\nAnd he was overjoyed when it happened that he did not meet a soldier.\nStill, his heart was so heavy that he needed another heart on which to\nlean and moan. Cesarine, to whom from the first he confided the fatal\ntruth, knew all his secrets. Many stolen glances passed between them,\nglances of despair or smothered hope,--interpellations of the eye darted\nwith mutual eagerness, inquiries and replies full of sympathy, rays\npassing from soul to soul. Birotteau compelled himself to seem gay, even\njovial, with his wife. If Constance asked a question--bah! everything\nwas going well; Popinot (about whom Cesar knew nothing) was succeeding;\nthe oil was looking up; the notes with Claparon would be paid; there was\nnothing to fear. His mock joy was terrible to witness. When his wife had\nfallen asleep in the sumptuous bed, Birotteau would rise to a sitting\nposition and think over his troubles. Cesarine would sometimes creep\nin with her bare feet, in her chemise, and a shawl over her white\nshoulders.\n\n\"Papa, I hear you,--you are crying,\" she would say, crying herself.\n\nBirotteau sank into such a torpor, after writing the letter which asked\nfor an interview with the great Francois Keller, that his daughter took\nhim out for a walk through the streets of Paris. For the first time he\nwas roused to notice enormous scarlet placards on all the walls, and his\neyes encountered the words \"Cephalic Oil.\"\n\nWhile catastrophes thus threatened \"The Queen of Roses\" to westward,\nthe house of A. Popinot was rising, radiant in the eastern splendors of\nsuccess. By the advice of Gaudissart and Finot, Anselme launched his oil\nheroically. Two thousand placards were pasted in three days on the most\nconspicuous spots in all Paris. No one could avoid coming face to face\nwith Cephalic Oil, and reading a pithy sentence, constructed by Finot,\nwhich announced the impossibility of forcing the hair to grow and the\ndangers of dyeing it, and was judiciously accompanied by a quotation\nfrom Vauquelin's report to the Academy of Sciences,--in short, a\nregular certificate of life for dead hair, offered to all those who\nused Cephalic Oil. Every hair-dresser in Paris, and all the perfumers,\nornamented their doorways with gilt frames containing a fine impression\nof the prospectus on vellum, at the top of which shone the engraving of\nHero and Leander, reduced in size, with the following assertion as an\nepigraph: \"The peoples of antiquity preserved their hair by the use of\nCephalic Oil.\"\n\n\"He has devised frames, permanent frames, perpetual placards,\"\nsaid Birotteau to himself, quite dumbfounded as he stood before the\nshop-front of the Cloche d'Argent.\n\n\"Then you have not seen,\" said his daughter, \"the frame which Monsieur\nAnselme has brought with his own hands, sending Celestin three hundred\nbottles of oil?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"Celestin has already sold fifty to passers-by, and sixty to regular\ncustomers.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Cesar.\n\nThe poor man, bewildered by the clash of bells which misery jangles in\nthe ears of its victims, lived and moved in a dazed condition. The night\nbefore, Popinot had waited more than an hour to see him, and went away\nafter talking with Constance and Cesarine, who told him that Cesar was\nabsorbed in his great enterprise.\n\n\"Ah, true! the lands about the Madeleine.\"\n\nHappily, Popinot--who for a month had never left the Rue des\nCinq-Diamants, sitting up all night, and working all Sunday at the\nmanufactory--had seen neither the Ragons, nor Pillerault, nor his uncle\nthe judge. He allowed himself but two hours' sleep, poor lad! he had\nonly two clerks, but at the rate things were now going, he would soon\nneed four. In business, opportunity is everything. He who does not\nspring upon the back of success and clutch it by the mane, lets fortune\nescape. Popinot felt that his suit would prosper if six months hence he\ncould say to his uncle and aunt, \"I am secure; my fortune is made,\" and\ncarry to Birotteau thirty or forty thousand francs as his share of\nthe profits. He was ignorant of Roguin's flight, of the disasters and\nembarrassments which were closing down on Cesar, and he therefore could\nsay nothing indiscreet to Madame Birotteau.\n\nPopinot had promised Finot five hundred francs for every puff in a\nfirst-class newspaper, and already there were ten of them; three hundred\nfrancs for every second-rate paper, and there were ten of those,--in all\nof them Cephalic Oil was mentioned three times a month! Finot saw three\nthousand francs for himself out of these eight thousand--his first stake\non the vast green table of speculation! He therefore sprang like a lion\non his friends and acquaintances; he haunted the editorial rooms; he\nwormed himself to the very bedsides of editors in the morning, and\nprowled about the lobby of the theatres at night. \"Think of my oil, dear\nfriend; I have no interest in it--bit of good fellowship, you know!\"\n\"Gaudissart, jolly dog!\" Such was the first and the last phrase of all\nhis allocutions. He begged for the bottom lines of the final columns of\nthe newspapers, and inserted articles for which he asked no pay from the\neditors. Wily as a supernumerary who wants to be an actor, wide-awake\nas an errand-boy who earns sixty francs a month, he wrote wheedling\nletters, flattered the self-love of editors-in-chief, and did them base\nservices to get his articles inserted. Money, dinners, platitudes, all\nserved the purpose of his eager activity. With tickets for the theatre,\nhe bribed the printers who about midnight are finishing up the columns\nof a newspaper with little facts and ready-made items kept on hand. At\nthat hour Finot hovered around printing-presses, busy, apparently,\nwith proofs to be corrected. Keeping friends with everybody, he\nbrought Cephalic Oil to a triumphant success over Pate de Regnauld, and\nBrazilian Mixture, and all the other inventions which had the genius to\ncomprehend journalistic influence and the suction power that reiterated\nnewspaper articles have upon the public mind. In these early days of\ntheir innocence many journalists were like cattle; they were unaware\nof their inborn power; their heads were full of actresses,--Florine,\nTullia, Mariette, etc. They laid down the law to everybody, but they\npicked up nothing for themselves. As Finot's schemes did not concern\nactresses who wanted applause, nor plays to be puffed, nor vaudevilles\nto be accepted, nor articles which had to be paid for,--on the contrary,\nhe paid money on occasion, and gave timely breakfasts,--there was soon\nnot a newspaper in Paris which did not mention Cephalic Oil, and\ncall attention to its remarkable concurrence with the principles of\nVauquelin's analysis; ridiculing all those who thought hair could be\nmade to grow, and proclaiming the danger of dyeing it.\n\nThese articles rejoiced the soul of Gaudissart, who used them as\nammunition to destroy prejudices, bringing to bear upon the provinces\nwhat his successors have since named, in honor of him, \"the charge\nof the tongue-battery.\" In those days Parisian newspapers ruled the\ndepartments, which were still (unhappy regions!) without _local organs_.\nThe papers were therefore soberly studied, from the title to the name\nof the printer,--a last line which may have hidden the ironies of\npersecuted opinion. Gaudissart, thus backed up by the press, met with\nstartling success from the very first town which he favored with his\ntongue. Every shopkeeper in the provinces wanted the gilt frames, and\nthe prospectuses with Hero and Leander at the top of them.\n\nIn Paris, Finot fired at Macassar Oil that delightful joke which\nmade people so merry at the Funambules, when Pierrot, taking an old\nhair-broom, anointed it with Macassar Oil, and the broom incontinently\nbecame a mop. This ironical scene excited universal laughter. Finot\ngaily related in after days that without the thousand crowns he earned\nthrough Cephalic Oil he should have died of misery and despair. To him\na thousand crowns was fortune. It was in this campaign that he\nguessed--let him have the honor of being the first to do so--the\nillimitable power of advertisement, of which he made so great and so\njudicious a use. Three months later he became editor-in-chief of a\nlittle journal which he finally bought, and which laid the foundation\nof his ultimate success. Just as the tongue-battery of the illustrious\nGaudissart, that Murat of travellers, when brought to bear upon the\nprovinces and the frontiers, made the house of A. Popinot and Company\na triumphant mercantile success in the country regions, so likewise did\nCephalic Oil triumph in Parisian opinion, thanks to Finot's famishing\nassault upon the newspapers, which gave it as much publicity as that\nobtained by Brazilian Mixture and the Pate de Regnauld. From the start,\npublic opinion, thus carried by storm, begot three successes, three\nfortunes, and proved the advance guard of that invasion of ambitious\nschemes which since have poured their crowded battalions into the arena\nof journalism, for which they have created--oh, mighty revolution!--the\npaid advertisement. The name of A. Popinot and Company now flaunted on\nall the walls and all the shop-fronts. Incapable of perceiving the full\nbearing of such publicity, Birotteau merely said to his daughter,--\n\n\"Little Popinot is following in my steps.\"\n\nHe did not understand the difference of the times, nor appreciate the\npower of the novel methods of execution, whose rapidity and extent took\nin, far more promptly than ever before, the whole commercial universe.\nBirotteau had not set foot in his manufactory since the ball; he knew\nnothing therefore of the energy and enterprise displayed by Popinot.\nAnselme had engaged all Cesar's workmen, and often slept himself on the\npremises. His fancy pictured Cesarine sitting on the cases, and hovering\nover the shipments; her name seemed printed on the bills; and as he\nworked with his coat off, and his shirt-sleeves rolled up, courageously\nnailing up the cases himself, in default of the necessary clerks, he\nsaid in his heart, \"She shall be mine!\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThe following day Cesar went to Francois Keller's house in Rue du\nHoussaye, having spent the night turning over in his mind what he\nought to say, or ought not to say, to a leading man in banking circles.\nHorrible palpitations of the heart assailed him as he approached the\nhouse of the Liberal banker, who belonged to a party accused, with good\nreason, of seeking the overthrow of the restored Bourbons. The perfumer,\nlike all the lesser tradesmen of Paris, was ignorant of the habits\nand customs of the upper banking circles. Between the higher walks of\nfinance and ordinary commerce, there is in Paris a class of secondary\nhouses, useful intermediaries for banking interests, which find in them\nan additional security. Constance and Birotteau, who had never gone\nbeyond their means, whose purse had never run dry, and who kept their\nmoneys in their own possession, had so far never needed the services\nof these intermediary houses; they were therefore unknown in the higher\nregions of a bank. Perhaps it is a mistake not to take out credits, even\nif we do not need them. Opinions vary on this point. However that may\nbe, Birotteau now deeply regretted that his signature was unknown.\nStill, as deputy-mayor, and therefore known in politics, he thought he\nhad only to present his name and be admitted: he was quite ignorant of\nthe ceremonial, half regal, which attended an audience with Francois\nKeller. He was shown into a salon which adjoined the study of the\ncelebrated banker,--celebrated in various ways. Birotteau found\nhimself among a numerous company of deputies, writers, journalists,\nstock-brokers, merchants of the upper grades, agents, engineers, and\nabove all satellites, or henchmen, who passed from group to group, and\nknocked in a peculiar manner at the door of the study, which they were,\nas it seemed, privileged to enter.\n\n\"What am I in the midst of all this?\" thought Birotteau, quite\nbewildered by the stir of this intellectual kiln, where the daily bread\nof the opposition was kneaded and baked, and the scenes of the grand\ntragi-comedy played by the Left were rehearsed. On one side he heard\nthem discussing the question of loans to complete the net-work of canals\nproposed by the department on highways; and the discussion involved\nmillions! On the other, journalists, pandering to the banker's\nself-love, were talking about the session of the day before, and the\nimpromptu speech of the great man. In the course of two long hours\nBirotteau saw the banker three times, as he accompanied certain persons\nof importance three steps from the door of his study. But Francois\nKeller went to the door of the antechamber with the last, who was\nGeneral Foy.\n\n\"There is no hope for me!\" thought Birotteau with a shrinking heart.\n\nWhen the banker returned to his study, the troop of courtiers, friends,\nand self-seekers pressed round him like dogs pursuing a bitch. A few\nbold curs slipped, in spite of him, into the sanctum. The conferences\nlasted five, ten, or fifteen minutes. Some went away chap-fallen; others\naffected satisfaction, and took on airs of importance. Time passed;\nBirotteau looked anxiously at the clock. No one paid the least attention\nto the hidden grief which moaned silently in the gilded armchair in the\nchimney corner, near the door of the cabinet where dwelt the universal\npanacea--credit! Cesar remembered sadly that for a brief moment he too\nhad been a king among his own people, as this man was a king daily; and\nhe measured the depth of the abyss down which he had fallen. Ah, bitter\nthought! how many tears were driven back during those waiting hours! how\nmany times did he not pray to God that this man might be favorable to\nhim! for he saw, through the coarse varnish of popular good humor, a\ntone of insolence, a choleric tyranny, a brutal desire to rule, which\nterrified his gentle spirit. At last, when only ten or twelve persons\nwere left in the room, Birotteau resolved that the next time the outer\ndoor of the study turned on its hinges he would rise and face the great\norator, and say to him, \"I am Birotteau!\" The grenadier who sprang first\ninto the redoubt at Moscow displayed no greater courage than Cesar now\nsummoned up to perform this act.\n\n\"After all, I am his mayor,\" he said to himself as he rose to proclaim\nhis name.\n\nThe countenance of Francois Keller at once became affable; he evidently\ndesired to be cordial. He glanced at Cesar's red ribbon, and stepping\nback, opened the door of his study and motioned him to enter, remaining\nhimself for some time to speak with two men, who rushed in from the\nstaircase with the violence of a waterspout.\n\n\"Decazes wants to speak to you,\" said one of them.\n\n\"It is a question of defeating the Pavillon Marsan!\" cried the other.\n\"The King's eyes are opened. He is coming round to us.\"\n\n\"We will go together to the Chamber,\" said the banker, striking the\nattitude of the frog who imitates an ox.\n\n\"How can he find time to think of business?\" thought Birotteau, much\ndisturbed.\n\nThe sun of successful superiority dazzled the perfumer, as light blinds\nthose insects who seek the falling day or the half-shadows of a starlit\nnight. On a table of immense size lay the budget, piles of the Chamber\nrecords, open volumes of the \"Moniteur,\" with passages carefully marked,\nto throw at the head of a Minister his forgotten words and force him to\nrecant them, under the jeering plaudits of a foolish crowd incapable of\nperceiving how circumstances alter cases. On another table were heaped\nportfolios, minutes, projects, specifications, and all the thousand\nmemoranda brought to bear upon a man into whose funds so many nascent\nindustries sought to dip. The royal luxury of this cabinet, filled with\npictures, statues, and works of art; the encumbered chimney-piece; the\naccumulation of many interests, national and foreign, heaped together\nlike bales,--all struck Birotteau's mind, dwarfed his powers, heightened\nhis terror, and froze his blood. On Francois Keller's desk lay bundles\nof notes and checks, letters of credit, and commercial circulars.\nKeller sat down and began to sign rapidly such letters as needed no\nexamination.\n\n\"Monsieur, to what do I owe the honor of this visit?\"\n\nAt these words, uttered for him alone by a voice which influenced\nall Europe, while the eager hand was running over the paper, the poor\nperfumer felt something that was like a hot iron in his stomach. He\nassumed the ingratiating manner which for ten years past the banker had\nseen all men put on when they wanted to get the better of him for\ntheir own purposes, and which gave him at once the advantage over them.\nFrancois Keller accordingly darted at Cesar a look which shot through\nhis head,--a Napoleonic look. This imitation of Napoleon's glance was a\nsilly satire, then popular with certain parvenus who had never seen so\nmuch as the base coin of their emperor. This glance fell upon Birotteau,\na devotee of the Right, a partisan of the government,--himself an\nelement of monarchical election,--like the stamp of a custom-house\nofficer affixed to a bale of merchandise.\n\n\"Monsieur, I will not waste your time; I will be brief. I come on\ncommercial business only,--to ask if I can obtain a credit. I was\nformerly a judge of the commercial courts, and known to the Bank of\nFrance. You will easily understand that if I had plenty of ready money\nI need only apply there, where you are yourself a director. I had the\nhonor of sitting on the Bench of commerce with Monsieur le baron Thibon,\nchairman of the committee on discounts; and he, most assuredly, would\nnot refuse me. But up to this time I have never made use of my credit\nor my signature; my signature is virgin,--and you know what difficulties\nthat puts in the way of negotiation.\"\n\nKeller moved his head, and Birotteau took the movement for one of\nimpatience.\n\n\"Monsieur, these are the facts,\" he resumed. \"I am engaged in an affair\nof landed property, outside of my business--\"\n\nFrancois Keller, who continued to sign and read his documents, without\nseeming to listen to Birotteau, here turned round and made him a little\nsign of attention, which encouraged the poor man. He thought the matter\nwas taking a favorable turn, and breathed again.\n\n\"Go on; I hear you,\" said Keller good-naturedly.\n\n\"I have purchased, at half its value, certain land about the\nMadeleine--\"\n\n\"Yes; I heard Nucingen speak of that immense affair,--undertaken, I\nbelieve, by Claparon and Company.\"\n\n\"Well,\" continued Cesar, \"a credit of a hundred thousand francs, secured\non my share of the purchase, will suffice to carry me along until I can\nreap certain profits from a discovery of mine in perfumery. Should it be\nnecessary, I will cover your risk by notes on a new establishment,--the\nfirm of A. Popinot--\"\n\nKeller seemed to care very little about the firm of Popinot; and\nBirotteau, perceiving that he had made a false move, stopped short;\nthen, alarmed by the silence, he resumed, \"As for the interest, we--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the banker, \"the matter can be arranged; don't doubt my\ndesire to be of service to you. Busy as I am,--for I have the finances\nof Europe on my shoulders, and the Chamber takes all my time,--you will\nnot be surprised to hear that I leave the vast bulk of our affairs to\nthe examination of others. Go and see my brother Adolphe, downstairs;\nexplain to him the nature of your securities; if he approves of the\noperation, come back here with him to-morrow or the day after, at five\nin the morning,--the hour at which I examine into certain business\nmatters. We shall be proud and happy to obtain your confidence. You are\none of those consistent royalists with whom, of course, we are political\nenemies, but whose good-will is always flattering--\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Cesar, elated by this specimen of tribune eloquence, \"I\ntrust I am as worthy of the honor you do me as I was of the signal and\nroyal favor which I earned by my services on the Bench of commerce, and\nby fighting--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" interrupted the banker, \"your reputation is a passport,\nMonsieur Birotteau. You will, of course, propose nothing that is not\nfeasible, and you can depend on our co-operation.\"\n\nA lady, Madame Keller, one of the two daughters of the Comte de\nGondreville, here opened a door which Birotteau had not observed.\n\n\"I hope to see you before you go the Chamber,\" she said.\n\n\"It is two o'clock,\" exclaimed the banker; \"the battle has begun.\nExcuse me, monsieur, it is a question of upsetting the ministry. See my\nbrother--\"\n\nHe conducted the perfumer to the door of the salon, and said to one of\nthe servants, \"Show monsieur the way to Monsieur Adolphe.\"\n\nAs Cesar traversed a labyrinth of staircases, under the guidance of a\nman in livery, towards an office far less sumptuous but more useful than\nthat of the head of the house, feeling himself astride the gentle steed\nof hope, he stroked his chin, and augured well from the flatteries of\nthe great man. He regretted that an enemy of the Bourbons should be so\ngracious, so able, so fine an orator.\n\nFull of these illusions he entered a cold bare room, furnished with\ntwo desks on rollers, some shabby armchairs, a threadbare carpet, and\ncurtains that were much neglected. This cabinet was to that of the elder\nbrother like a kitchen to a dining-room, or a work-room to a shop. Here\nwere turned inside out all matters touching the bank and commerce; here\nall enterprises were sifted, and the first tithes levied, on behalf of\nthe bank, upon the profits of industries judged worthy of being upheld.\nHere were devised those bold strokes by which short-lived monopolies\nwere called into being and rapidly sucked dry. Here defects of\nlegislation were chronicled; and bargains driven, without shame, for\nwhat the Bourse terms \"pickings to be gobbled up,\" commissions exacted\nfor the smallest services, such as lending their name to an enterprise,\nand allowing it credit. Here were hatched the specious, legal plots by\nwhich silent partnerships were taken in doubtful enterprises, that the\nbank might lie in wait for the moment of success, and then crush\nthem and seize the property by demanding a return of the capital at a\ncritical moment,--an infamous trick, which involves and ruins many small\nshareholders.\n\nThe two brothers had each selected his appropriate part. Upstairs,\nFrancois, the brilliant man of the world and of politics, assumed a\nregal air, bestowed courtesies and promises, and made himself agreeable\nto all. His manners were easy and complying; he looked at business\nfrom a lofty standpoint; he intoxicated new recruits and fledgling\nspeculators with the wine of his favor and his fervid speech, as he made\nplain to them their own ideas. Downstairs, Adolphe unsaid his brother's\nwords, excused him on the ground of political preoccupation, and\ncleverly slipped the rake along the cloth. He played the part of the\nresponsible partner, the careful business man. Two words, two speeches,\ntwo interviews, were required before an understanding could be reached\nwith this perfidious house. Often the gracious \"yes\" of the sumptuous\nupper floor became a dry \"no\" in Adolphe's region. This obstructive\nmanoeuvre gave time for reflection, and often served to fool unskilful\napplicants. As Cesar entered, the banker's brother was conversing with\nthe famous Palma, intimate adviser of the house of Keller, who retired\non the appearance of the perfumer. When Birotteau had explained his\nerrand, Adolphe--much the cleverest of the two brothers, a thorough\nlynx, with a keen eye, thin lips, and a dry skin--cast at Birotteau,\nlowering his head to look over his spectacles as he did so, a look which\nwe must call the banker-look,--a cross between that of a vulture and\nthat of an attorney; eager yet indifferent, clear yet vague, glittering\nthough sombre.\n\n\"Have the goodness to send me the deeds relating to the affair of the\nMadeleine,\" he said; \"our security in making you this credit lies there:\nwe must examine them before we consent to make it, or discuss the terms.\nIf the affair is sound, we shall be willing, so as not to embarrass you,\nto take a share of the profits in place of receiving a discount.\"\n\n\"Well,\" thought Birotteau, as he walked away, \"I see what it means. Like\nthe hunted beaver, I am to give up a part of my skin. After all, it is\nbetter to be shorn than killed.\"\n\nHe went home smiling gaily, and his gaiety was genuine.\n\n\"I am saved,\" he said to Cesarine. \"I am to have a credit with the\nKellers.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nIt was not until the 29th of December that Birotteau was allowed to\nre-enter Adolphe's cabinet. The first time he called, Adolphe had gone\ninto the country to look at a piece of property which the great orator\nthought of buying. The second time, the two Kellers were deeply engaged\nfor the whole day, preparing a tender for a loan proposed in the\nChamber, and they begged Monsieur Birotteau to return on the following\nFriday. These delays were killing to the poor man. But Friday came at\nlast. Birotteau found himself in the cabinet, placed in one corner\nof the fireplace, facing the light from a window, with Adolphe Keller\nopposite to him.\n\n\"They are all right, monsieur,\" said the banker, pointing to the deeds.\n\"But what payments have you made on the price of the land?\"\n\n\"One hundred and forty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Cash?\"\n\n\"Notes.\"\n\n\"Are they paid?\"\n\n\"They are not yet due.\"\n\n\"But supposing you have paid more than the present value of the\nproperty, where will be our security? It will rest solely on the respect\nyou inspire, and the consideration in which you are held. Business is\nnot conducted on sentiment. If you had paid two hundred thousand francs,\nsupposing that there were another one hundred thousand paid down in\nadvance for possession of the land, we should then have had the security\nof a hundred thousand francs, to warrant us in giving you a credit of\none hundred thousand. The result might be to make us owners of your\nshare by our paying for it, instead of your doing so; consequently we\nmust be satisfied that the affair is a sound one. To wait five years to\ndouble our capital won't do for us; it is better to employ it in other\nways. There are so many chances! You are trying to circulate paper to\npay your notes when they fall due,--a dangerous game. It is wiser to\nstep back for a better leap. The affair does not suit us.\"\n\nThis sentence struck Birotteau as if the executioner had stamped his\nshoulder with the marking-iron; he lost his head.\n\n\"Come,\" said Adolphe, \"my brother feels a great interest in you;\nhe spoke of you to me. Let us examine into your affairs,\" he added,\nglancing at Cesar with the look of a courtesan eager to pay her rent.\n\nBirotteau became Molineux,--a being at whom he had once laughed so\nloftily. Enticed along by the banker,--who enjoyed disentangling\nthe bobbins of the poor man's thought, and who knew as well how to\ncross-question a merchant as Popinot the judge knew how to make a\ncriminal betray himself,--Cesar recounted all his enterprises; he put\nforward his Double Paste of Sultans and Carminative Balm, the Roguin\naffair, and his lawsuit about the mortgage on which he had received\nno money. As he watched the smiling, attentive face of Keller and the\nmotions of his head, Birotteau said to himself, \"He is listening; I\ninterest him; I shall get my credit!\" Adolphe Keller was laughing at\nCesar, just as Cesar had laughed at Molineux. Carried away by the lust\nof speech peculiar to those who are made drunk by misfortune, Cesar\nrevealed his inner man; he gave his measure when he ended by offering\nthe security of Cephalic Oil and the firm of Popinot,--his last stake.\nThe worthy man, led on by false hopes, allowed Adolphe Keller to sound\nand fathom him, and he stood revealed to the banker's eyes as a royalist\njackass on the point of failure. Delighted to foresee the bankruptcy of\na deputy-mayor of the arrondissement, an official just decorated, and\na man in power, Keller now curtly told Birotteau that he could neither\ngive him a credit nor say anything in his favor to his brother Francois.\nIf Francois gave way to idiotic generosity, and helped people of another\nway of thinking from his own, men who were his political enemies, he,\nAdolphe, would oppose with might and main any attempt to make a dupe of\nhim, and would prevent him from holding out a hand to the adversary of\nNapoleon, wounded at Saint-Roch. Birotteau, exasperated, tried to\nsay something about the cupidity of the great banking-houses, their\nharshness, their false philanthropy; but he was seized with so violent\na pain that he could scarcely stammer a few words about the Bank of\nFrance, from which the Kellers were allowed to borrow.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Adolphe Keller; \"but the Bank would never discount paper\nwhich a private bank refused.\"\n\n\"The Bank of France,\" said Birotteau, \"has always seemed to me to miss\nits vocation when it congratulates itself, as it does in presenting its\nreports, on never losing more than one or two hundred thousand francs\nthrough Parisian commerce: it should be the guardian and protector of\nParisian commerce.\"\n\nAdolphe smiled, and got up with the air and gesture of being bored.\n\n\"If the Bank were mixed up as silent partners with people who are\ninvolved in the most knavish and hazardous market in the world, it would\nsoon have to hand in its schedule. It has, even now, immense difficulty\nin protecting itself against forgeries and false circulations of all\nkinds. Where would it be if it had to take account of the business of\nevery one who wanted to get something out of it?\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"Where shall I find ten thousand francs for to-morrow, the THIRTIETH?\"\ncried Birotteau, as he crossed the courtyard.\n\nAccording to Parisian custom, notes were paid on the thirtieth, if the\nthirty-first was a holiday.\n\nAs Cesar reached the outer gate, his eyes bathed in tears, he scarcely\nsaw a fine English horse, covered with sweat, which drew the handsomest\ncabriolet that rolled in those days along the pavements of Paris, and\nwhich was now pulled up suddenly beside him. He would gladly have been\nrun over and crushed by it; if he died by accident, the confusion of\nhis affairs would be laid to that circumstance. He did not recognize du\nTillet, who in elegant morning dress jumped lightly down, throwing\nthe reins to his groom and a blanket over the back of his smoking\nthoroughbred.\n\n\"What chance brings you here?\" said the former clerk to his old patron.\n\nDu Tillet knew very well what it was, for the Kellers had made inquiries\nof Claparon, who by referring them to du Tillet had demolished the past\nreputation of the poor man. Though quickly checked, the tears on Cesar's\nface spoke volumes.\n\n\"It is possible that you have asked assistance from these Bedouins?\"\nsaid du Tillet, \"these cut-throats of commerce, full of infamous tricks;\nwho run up indigo when they have monopolized the trade, and pull down\nrice to force the holders to sell at low prices, and so enable them to\nmanage the market? Atrocious pirates, who have neither faith, nor law,\nnor soul, nor honor! You don't know what they are capable of doing.\nThey will give you a credit if they think you have got a good thing, and\nclose it the moment you get into the thick of the enterprise; and then\nyou will be forced to make it all over to them, at any villanous price\nthey choose to give. Havre, Bordeaux, Marseilles, could tell you tales\nabout them! They make use of politics to cover up their filthy ways. If\nI were you I should get what I could out of them in any way, and without\nscruple. Let us walk on, Birotteau. Joseph, lead the horse about, he is\ntoo hot: the devil! he is a capital of a thousand crowns.\"\n\nSo saying, he turned toward the boulevard.\n\n\"Come, my dear master,--for you were once my master,--tell me, are you\nin want of money? Have they asked you for securities, the scoundrels?\nI, who know you, I offer you money on your simple note. I have made an\nhonorable fortune with infinite pains. I began it in Germany; I may as\nwell tell you that I bought up the debts of the king, at sixty per cent\nof their amount: your endorsement was very useful to me at that time,\nand I am not ungrateful,--not I. If you want ten thousand francs, they\nare yours.\"\n\n\"Du Tillet!\" cried Cesar, \"can it be true? you are not joking with me?\nYes, I am rather pinched, but only for a moment.\"\n\n\"I know,--that affair of Roguin,\" replied du Tillet. \"Hey! I am in for\nten thousand francs which the old rogue borrowed of me just before he\nwent off; but Madame Roguin will pay them back from her dower. I have\nadvised the poor woman not to be so foolish as to spend her own fortune\nin paying debts contracted for a prostitute. Of course, it would be\nwell if she paid everything, but she cannot favor some creditors to\nthe detriment of others. You are not a Roguin; I know you,\" said du\nTillet,--\"you would blow your brains out rather than make me lose a sou.\nHere we are at Rue de la Chaussee-d'Antin; come home with me.\"\n\nThey entered a bedroom, with which Madame Birotteau's compared like\nthat of a chorus-singer's on a fourth floor with the appartement of a\nprima-donna. The ceiling was of violet-colored satin, heightened in its\neffect by folds of white satin; a rug of ermine lay at the bedside, and\ncontrasted with the purple tones of a Turkish carpet. The furniture\nand all the accessories were novel in shape, costly, and choice in\ncharacter. Birotteau paused before an exquisite clock, decorated with\nCupid and Psyche, just designed for a famous banker, from whom du Tillet\nhad obtained the sole copy ever made of it. The former master and\nhis former clerk at last reached an elegant coquettish cabinet, more\nredolent of love than finance. Madame Roguin had doubtless contributed,\nin return for the care bestowed upon her fortune, the paper-knife in\nchiselled gold, the paper-weights of carved malachite, and all the\ncostly knick-knacks of unrestrained luxury. The carpet, one of the rich\nproducts of Belgium, was as pleasant to the eye as to the foot which\nfelt the soft thickness of its texture. Du Tillet made the poor, amazed,\nbewildered perfumer sit down at a corner of the fireplace.\n\n\"Will you breakfast with me?\"\n\nHe rang the bell. Enter a footman better dressed than Birotteau.\n\n\"Tell Monsieur Legras to come here, and then find Joseph at the door of\nthe Messrs. Keller; tell him to return to the stable. Leave word with\nAdolphe Keller that instead of going to see him, I shall expect him at\nthe Bourse; and order breakfast served immediately.\"\n\nThese commands amazed Cesar.\n\n\"He whistles to that formidable Adolphe Keller like a dog!--he, du\nTillet!\"\n\nA little tiger, about a thumb high, set out a table, which Birotteau had\nnot observed, so slim was it, and brought in a _pate de foie gras_, a\nbottle of claret, and a number of dainty dishes which only appeared in\nBirotteau's household once in three months, on great festive occasions.\nDu Tillet enjoyed the effect. His hatred towards the only man who had it\nin his power to despise him burned so hotly that Birotteau seemed, even\nto his own mind, like a sheep defending itself against a tiger. For an\ninstant, a generous idea entered du Tillet's heart: he asked himself if\nhis vengeance were not sufficiently accomplished. He hesitated between\nthis awakened mercy and his dormant hate.\n\n\"I can annihilate him commercially,\" he thought; \"I have the power of\nlife or death over him,--over his wife who insulted me, and his daughter\nwhose hand once seemed to me a fortune. I have got his money; suppose I\ncontent myself with letting the poor fool swim at the end of a line I'll\nhold for him?\"\n\nHonest minds are devoid of tact; their excellence is uncalculating,\neven unreflecting, because they are wholly without evasions or mental\nreservations of their own. Birotteau now brought about his downfall; he\nincensed the tiger, pierced him to the heart without knowing it,\nmade him implacable by a thoughtless word, a eulogy, a virtuous\nrecognition,--by the kind-heartedness, as it were, of his own integrity.\nWhen the cashier entered, du Tillet motioned him to take notice of\nCesar.\n\n\"Monsieur Legras, bring me ten thousand francs, and a note of hand for\nthat amount, drawn to my order, at ninety days' sight, by monsieur, who\nis Monsieur Cesar Birotteau, you know.\"\n\nDu Tillet cut the pate, poured out a glass of claret, and urged Cesar\nto eat. The poor man felt he was saved, and gave way to convulsive\nlaughter; he played with his watch-chain, and only put a mouthful into\nhis mouth, when du Tillet said to him, \"You are not eating!\" Birotteau\nthus betrayed the depths of the abyss into which du Tillet's hand had\nplunged him, from which that hand now withdrew him, and into which it\nhad the power to plunge him again. When the cashier returned, and Cesar\nsigned the note, and felt the ten bank-notes in his pocket, he was\nno longer master of himself. A moment sooner, and the Bank, his\nneighborhood, every one, was to know that he could not meet his\npayments, and he must have told his ruin to his wife; now, all was safe!\nThe joy of this deliverance equalled in its intensity the tortures of\nhis peril. The eyes of the poor man moistened, in spite of himself.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, my dear master?\" asked du Tillet. \"Would\nyou not do for me to-morrow what I do for you to-day? Is it not as\nsimple as saying, How do you do?\"\n\n\"Du Tillet,\" said the worthy man, with gravity and emphasis, and rising\nto take the hand of his former clerk, \"I give you back my esteem.\"\n\n\"What! had I lost it?\" cried du Tillet, so violently stabbed in the very\nbosom of his prosperity that the color came into his face.\n\n\"Lost?--well, not precisely,\" said Birotteau, thunder-struck at his own\nstupidity: \"they told me certain things about your _liaison_ with Madame\nRoguin. The devil! taking the wife of another man--\"\n\n\"You are beating round the bush, old fellow,\" thought du Tillet, and\nas the words crossed his mind he came back to his original project,\nand vowed to bring that virtue low, to trample it under foot, to render\ndespicable in the marts of Paris the honorable and virtuous merchant who\nhad caught him, red-handed, in a theft. All hatreds, public or private,\nfrom woman to woman, from man to man, have no other cause then some\nsuch detection. People do not hate each other for injured interests, for\nwounds, not even for a blow; all such wrongs can be redressed. But to\nhave been seized, _flagrante delicto_, in a base act! The duel which\nfollows between the criminal and the witness of his crime ends only with\nthe death of the one or of the other.\n\n\"Oh! Madame Roguin!\" said du Tillet, jestingly, \"don't you call that a\nfeather in a young man's cap? I understand you, my dear master; somebody\nhas told you that she lent me money. Well, on the contrary it is I\nwho have protected her fortune, which was strangely involved in her\nhusband's affairs. The origin of my fortune is pure, as I have just told\nyou. I had nothing, you know. Young men are sometimes in positions of\nfrightful necessity. They may lose their self-control in the depths of\npoverty, and if they make, as the Republic made, forced loans--well,\nthey pay them back; and in so doing they are more honest than France\nherself.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" cried Birotteau. \"My son, God--is it not Voltaire who\nsays,--\n\n  \"'He rendered repentance the virtue of mortals'?\"\n\n\"Provided,\" answered du Tillet, stabbed afresh by this\nquotation,--\"provided they do not carry off the property of their\nneighbors, basely, meanly; as, for example, you would do if you failed\nwithin three months, and my ten thousand francs went to perdition.\"\n\n\"I fail!\" cried Birotteau, who had taken three glasses of wine, and\nwas half-drunk with joy. \"Everybody knows what I think about failure!\nFailure is death to a merchant; I should die of it!\"\n\n\"I drink your health,\" said du Tillet.\n\n\"Your health and prosperity,\" returned Cesar. \"Why don't you buy your\nperfumery from me?\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said du Tillet, \"I am afraid of Madame Cesar; she always\nmade an impression on me. If you had not been my master, on my word!\nI--\"\n\n\"You are not the first to think her beautiful; others have desired her;\nbut she loves me! Well, now, du Tillet, my friend,\" resumed Birotteau,\n\"don't do things by halves.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nBirotteau explained the affair of the lands to his former clerk, who\npretended to open his eyes wide, and complimented the perfumer on his\nperspicacity and penetration, and praised the enterprise.\n\n\"Well, I am very glad to have your approbation; you are thought one\nof the wise-heads of the banking business, du Tillet. Dear fellow, you\nmight get me a credit at the Bank of France, so that I can wait for the\nprofits of Cephalic Oil at my ease.\"\n\n\"I can give you a letter to the firm of Nucingen,\" answered du Tillet,\nperceiving that he could make his victim dance all the figures in the\nreel of bankruptcy.\n\nFerdinand sat down to his desk and wrote the following letter:--\n\n\n  _To Monsieur le baron de Nucingen_:\n\n  My dear Baron,--The bearer of this letter is Monsieur Cesar\n  Birotteau, deputy-mayor of the second arrondissement, and one of\n  the best known manufacturers of Parisian perfumery; he wishes to\n  have business relations with your house. You can confidently do\n  all that he asks of you; and in obliging him you will oblige\n\n                                                     Your friend,\n                                                     F. Du Tillet.\n\n\nDu Tillet did not dot the _i_ in his signature. To those with whom he\ndid business this intentional error was a sign previously agreed upon.\nThe strongest recommendations, the warmest appeals contained in the\nletter were to mean nothing. All such letters, in which exclamation\nmarks were suppliants and du Tillet placed himself, as it were, upon\nhis knees, were to be considered as extorted by necessity; he could\nnot refuse to write them, but they were to be regarded as not written.\nSeeing the _i_ without a dot, the correspondent was to amuse the\npetitioner with empty promises. Even men of the world, and sometimes\nthe most distinguished, are thus gulled like children by business men,\nbankers, and lawyers, who all have a double signature,--one dead,\nthe other living. The cleverest among them are fooled in this way. To\nunderstand the trick, we must experience the two-fold effects of a warm\nletter and a cold one.\n\n\"You have saved me, du Tillet!\" said Cesar, reading the letter.\n\n\"Thank heaven!\" said du Tillet, \"ask for what money you want. When\nNucingen reads my letter he will give you all you need. Unhappily, my\nown funds are tied up for a few days; if not, I certainly would not send\nyou to the great banking princes. The Kellers are mere pygmies compared\nto Baron de Nucingen. Law reappears on earth in Nucingen. With this\nletter of mine you can face the 15th of January, and after that, we will\nsee about it. Nucingen and I are the best friends in the world; he would\nnot disoblige me for a million.\"\n\n\"It is a guarantee in itself,\" thought Birotteau, as he went away full\nof gratitude to his old clerk. \"Well, a benefit is never lost!\" he\ncontinued, philosophizing very wide of the mark. Nevertheless, one\nthought embittered his joy. For several days he had prevented his wife\nfrom looking into the ledgers; he had put the business on Celestin's\nshoulders and assisted in it himself; he wished, apparently, that his\nwife and daughter should be at liberty to take full enjoyment out of\nthe beautiful appartement he had given them. But the first flush of\nhappiness over, Madame Birotteau would have died rather than renounce\nher right of personally inspecting the affairs of the house,--of\nholding, as she phrased it, the handle of the frying-pan. Birotteau was\nat his wits' end; he had used all his cunning in trying to hide from his\nwife the symptoms of his embarrassment. Constance strongly disapproved\nof sending round the bills; she had scolded the clerks and accused\nCelestin of wishing to ruin the establishment, thinking that it was all\nhis doing. Celestin, by Birotteau's order, had allowed himself to be\nscolded. In the eyes of the clerks Madame Cesar governed her husband;\nfor though it is possible to deceive the public, the inmates of a\nhousehold are never deceived as to who exercises the real authority.\nBirotteau knew that he must now reveal his real situation to his wife,\nfor the account with du Tillet needed an explanation. When he got back\nto the shop, he saw, not without a shudder, that Constance was sitting\nin her old place behind the counter, examining the expense account, and\nno doubt counting up the money in the desk.\n\n\"How will you meet your payments to-morrow?\" she whispered as he sat\ndown beside her.\n\n\"With money,\" he answered, pulling out the bank-bills, and signing to\nCelestin to take them.\n\n\"Where did you get that money?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you all about it this evening. Celestin, write down, 'Last of\nMarch, note for ten thousand francs, to du Tillet's order.'\"\n\n\"Du Tillet!\" repeated Constance, struck with consternation.\n\n\"I am going to see Popinot,\" said Cesar; \"it is very wrong in me not to\nhave gone before. Have we sold his oil?\"\n\n\"The three hundred bottles he sent us are all gone.\"\n\n\"Birotteau, don't go out; I want to speak to you,\" said Constance,\ntaking him by the arm, and leading him into her bedroom with an\nimpetuosity which would have caused a laugh under other circumstances.\n\"Du Tillet,\" she said, when she had made sure no one but Cesarine was\nwith them,--\"du Tillet, who robbed us of three thousand francs! So you\nare doing business with du Tillet,--a monster, who wished to seduce me,\"\nshe whispered in his ear.\n\n\"Folly of youth,\" said Birotteau, assuming for the nonce the tone of a\nfree-thinker.\n\n\"Listen to me, Birotteau! You are all upset; you don't go to the\nmanufactory any more; there is something the matter, I feel it! You must\ntell me; I must know what it is.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Birotteau, \"we came very near being ruined,--we were ruined\nthis very morning; but it is all safe now.\"\n\nAnd he told the horrible story of his two weeks' misery.\n\n\"So that was the cause of your illness!\" exclaimed Constance.\n\n\"Yes, mamma,\" cried Cesarine, \"and papa has been so courageous! All that\nI desire in life is to be loved as he loves you. He has thought only of\nyour grief.\"\n\n\"My dream is fulfilled!\" said the poor woman, dropping upon the sofa at\nthe corner of the fireplace, pale, livid, terrified. \"I foresaw it all.\nI warned you on that fatal night, in our old room which you pulled to\npieces, that we should have nothing left but our eyes to weep with. My\npoor Cesarine, I--\"\n\n\"Now, there you go!\" cried Cesar; \"you will take away from me the\ncourage I need.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, dear friend,\" said Constance, taking his hand, and pressing\nit with a tenderness which went to the heart of the poor man. \"I do\nwrong. Misfortune has come; I will be silent, resigned, strong to bear\nit. No, you shall never hear a complaint from me.\" She threw herself\ninto his arms, weeping, and whispering, \"Courage, dear friend, courage!\nI will have courage for both, if necessary.\"\n\n\"My oil, wife,--my oil will save us!\"\n\n\"May God help us!\" said Constance.\n\n\"Anselme will help my father,\" said Cesarine.\n\n\"I'll go and see him,\" cried Cesar, deeply moved by the passionate\naccents of his wife, who after nineteen years of married life was not\nyet fully known to him. \"Constance, fear nothing! Here, read du\nTillet's letter to Monsieur de Nucingen; we are sure to obtain a credit.\nBesides,\" he said, allowing himself a necessary lie, \"there is our uncle\nPillerault; that is enough to give us courage.\"\n\n\"If that were all!\" said Constance, smiling.\n\nBirotteau, relieved of a heavy weight, walked away like a man suddenly\nset at liberty, though he felt within him that indefinable sinking which\nsucceeds great moral struggles in which more of the nervous fluid, more\nof the will is emitted than should be spent at one time, and by which,\nif we may say so, the capital of the existence is drawn upon. Birotteau\nhad aged already.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThe house of A. Popinot, Rue des Cinq-Diamants, had undergone a great\nchange in two months. The shop was repainted. The shelves, re-varnished\nand gilded and crowded with bottles, rejoiced the eye of those who had\neyes to see the symptoms of prosperity. The floors were littered with\npackages and wrapping-paper. The storerooms held small casks of various\noils, obtained for Popinot on commission by the devoted Gaudissart. The\nledgers, the accounts, and the desks were moved into the rooms above the\nshop and the back-shop. An old cook did all the household work for the\nmaster and his three clerks. Popinot, penned up in a corner of the shop\nclosed in with glass, might be seen in a serge apron and long sleeves\nof green linen, with a pen behind his ear, in the midst of a mass of\npapers, where in fact Birotteau now found him, as he was overhauling his\nletters full of proposals and checks and orders. At the words \"Hey, my\nboy!\" uttered by his old master, Popinot raised his head, locked up his\ncubby-hole, and came forward with a joyous air and the end of his nose a\nlittle red. There was no fire in the shop, and the door was always open.\n\n\"I feared you were never coming,\" he said respectfully.\n\nThe clerks crowded round to look at the distinguished perfumer, the\ndecorated deputy-mayor, the partner of their own master. Birotteau,\nso pitifully small at the Kellers, felt a craving to imitate\nthose magnates; he stroked his chin, rose on his heels with native\nself-complacency, and talked his usual platitudes.\n\n\"Hey, my lad! we get up early, don't we?\" he remarked.\n\n\"No, for we don't always go to bed,\" said Popinot. \"We must clutch\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you? My oil will make your fortune!\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur. But the means employed to sell it count for something. I\nhave set your diamond well.\"\n\n\"How do we stand?\" said Cesar. \"How far have you got? What are the\nprofits?\"\n\n\"Profits! at the end of two months! How can you expect it? Friend\nGaudissart has only been on the road for twenty-five days; he took a\npost-chaise without saying a word to me. Oh, he is devoted! We owe\na great deal to my uncle. The newspapers alone (here he whispered in\nBirotteau's ear) will cost us twelve thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Newspapers!\" exclaimed the deputy-mayor.\n\n\"Haven't you read them?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you know nothing,\" said Popinot. \"Twenty thousand francs worth of\nplacards, gilt frames, copies of the prospectus. One hundred thousand\nbottles bought. Ah, it is all paying through the nose at this moment! We\nare manufacturing on a grand scale. If you had set foot in the faubourg,\nwhere I often work all night, you would have seen a little nut-cracker\nwhich isn't to be sneezed at, I can tell you. On my own account, I have\nmade, in the last five days, not less than ten thousand francs, merely\nby commissions on the sale of druggists' oils.\"\n\n\"What a capable head!\" said Birotteau, laying his hand on little\nPopinot's thick hair and rubbing it about as if he were a baby. \"I found\nit out.\"\n\nSeveral persons here came in.\n\n\"On Sunday we dine at your aunt Ragon's,\" added Cesar, leaving Popinot\nto go on with his business, for he perceived that the fresh meat he had\ncome to taste was not yet cut up.\n\n\"It is amazing! A clerk becomes a merchant in twenty-four hours,\"\nthought Birotteau, who understood the happiness and self-assurance of\nAnselme as little as the dandy luxury of du Tillet. \"Anselme put on\na little stiff air when I patted him on the head, just as if he were\nFrancois Keller himself.\"\n\nBirotteau never once reflected that the clerks were looking on, and that\nthe master of the establishment had his dignity to preserve. In this\ninstance, as in the case of his speech to du Tillet, the worthy soul\ncommitted a folly out of pure goodness of heart, and for lack of knowing\nhow to withhold an honest sentiment vulgarly expressed. By this trifling\nact Cesar would have wounded irretrievably any other man than little\nPopinot.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThe Sunday dinner at the Ragon's was destined to be the last pleasure of\nthe nineteen happy years of the Birotteau household,--years of\nhappiness that were full to overflowing. Ragon lived in the Rue du\nPetit-Bourbon-Saint-Sulpice, on the second floor of a dignified old\nhouse, in an appartement decorated with large panels where painted\nshepherdesses danced in panniers, before whom fed the sheep of our\nnineteenth century, the sober and serious bourgeoisie,--whose comical\ndemeanor, with their respectful notions about the nobility, and their\ndevotion to the Sovereign and the Church, were all admirably represented\nby Ragon himself. The furniture, the clocks, linen, dinner-service, all\nseemed patriarchal; novel in form because of their very age. The salon,\nhung with old damask and draped with curtains in brocatelle, contained\nportraits of duchesses and other royalist tributes; also a superb\nPopinot, sheriff of Sancerre, painted by Latour,--the father of Madame\nRagon, a worthy, excellent man, in a picture out of which he smiled like\na parvenu in all his glory. When at home, Madame Ragon completed her\nnatural self with a little King Charles spaniel, which presented a\nsurprisingly harmonious effect as it lay on the hard little sofa, rococo\nin shape, that assuredly never played the part assigned to the sofa of\nCrebillon.\n\nAmong their many virtues, the Ragons were noted for the possession\nof old wines which had come to perfect mellowness, and for certain of\nMadame Anfoux's liqueurs, which certain persons, obstinately (though it\nwas said hopelessly) bent on making love to Madame Ragon, had brought\nher from the West Indies. Thus their little dinners were much prized.\nJeannette, the old cook, took care of the aged couple with blind\ndevotion: she would have stolen the fruit to make their sweetmeats.\nInstead of taking her money to the savings-bank, she put it judiciously\ninto lotteries, hoping that some day she could bestow a good round sum\non her master and mistress. On the appointed Sundays when they received\ntheir guests, she was, despite her years, active in the kitchen to\nsuperintend the dishes, which she served at the table with an agility\nthat (to use a favorite expression of the worthy Ragon) might have given\npoints to Mademoiselle Contat when she played Susanne in the \"Mariage de\nFigaro.\"\n\nThe guests on this occasion were Popinot the judge, Pillerault, Anselme,\nthe three Birotteaus, three Matifats, and the Abbe Loraux. Madame\nMatifat, whom we lately met crowned with a turban for the ball, now\nwore a gown of blue velvet, with coarse cotton stockings, leather shoes,\ngloves of chamois-skin with a border of green plush, and a bonnet\nlined with pink, filled in with white puffs about the face. These ten\npersonages assembled at five o'clock. The old Ragons always requested\ntheir guests to be punctual. When this worthy couple were invited out,\ntheir hosts always put the dinner at the same hour, remembering that\nstomachs which were sixty-five years old could not adapt themselves to\nthe novel hours recently adopted in the great world.\n\nCesarine was sure that Madame Ragon would place her beside Anselme;\nfor all women, be they fools or saints, know what is what in love. The\ndaughter of \"The Queen of Roses\" therefore dressed with the intention of\nturning Popinot's head. Her mother--having renounced, not without pain,\nthe thought of marrying her to Crottat, who to her eyes played the part\nof heir-apparent--assisted, with some bitter thoughts, at the toilet.\nMaternal forethought lowered the modest gauzy neckerchief to show a\nlittle of Cesarine's shoulders and the spring of her graceful throat,\nwhich was remarkably elegant. The Grecian bodice, crossing from left to\nright with five folds, opened slightly, showing delicious curves; the\ngray merino dress with green furbelows defined the pretty waist, which\nhad never looked so slender nor so supple. She wore earrings of gold\nfret-work, and her hair, gathered up _a la chinoise_, let the eye take\nin the soft freshness of a skin traced with blue veins, where the light\nshone chastely on the pure white tones. Cesarine was so coquettishly\nlovely that Madame Matifat could not help admitting it, without,\nhowever, perceiving that mother and daughter had the one purpose of\nbewitching Anselme.\n\nNeither Birotteau, his wife, Madame Matifat nor any of the others\ndisturbed the sweet converse which the young people, thrilling with\nlove, held in whispering voices within the embrasure of a window,\nthrough whose chinks the north wind blew its chilly whistle. The\nconversation of the elders became animated when Popinot the judge let\nfall a word about Roguin's flight, remarking that he was the second\nnotary who had absconded,--a crime formerly unknown. Madame Ragon, at\nthe word Roguin, touched her brother's foot, Pillerault spoke loudly to\ndrown his voice, and both made him a sign to remember Madame Birotteau.\n\n\"I know all,\" said Constance in a low, pained voice.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Madame Matifat to Birotteau, who humbly bowed his\nhead, \"how much did he carry of? If we are to believe the gossips, you\nare ruined.\"\n\n\"He had two hundred thousand francs of mine,\" said Cesar. \"As to the\nforty thousand he pretended to make me borrow from one of his clients,\nwhose property he had already squandered, I am now bringing a suit to\nrecover them.\"\n\n\"The case will be decided this week,\" said Popinot. \"I thought you would\nnot be unwilling that I should explain your situation to Monsieur le\npresident; he has ordered that all Roguin's papers be submitted to the\ncustody of the court, so as to ascertain the exact time when Roguin made\naway with the funds of his client, and thus verify the facts alleged by\nDerville, who made the argument himself to save you the expense.\"\n\n\"Shall we win?\" asked Madame Birotteau.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Popinot. \"Though I belong to the court in which\nthe suit is bought, I shall abstain from giving an opinion, even if\ncalled upon.\"\n\n\"Can there be any doubt in such a simple case?\" said Pillerault. \"Such\ndeeds make mention that payment has been made, and notaries are obliged\nto declare that they have seen the money passed from the lender to the\nborrower. Roguin would be sent to the galleys if the law could get hold\nof him.\n\n\"According to my ideas,\" said the judge, \"the lender ought to have sued\nRoguin for the costs and the caution-money; but it sometimes happens\nat the Cour Royale that in matters even more plain than this the judges\nstand six against six.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, what are they saying? Has Monsieur Roguin absconded?\"\nsaid Anselme, hearing at last what was going on about him. \"Monsieur\nsaid nothing of it to me,--to me who would shed my blood for him--\"\n\nCesarine fully understood that the whole family were included in the\n\"for him\"; for if the innocent girl could mistake the accent, she could\nnot misunderstand the glance, which wrapped her, as it were, in a rosy\nflame.\n\n\"I know you would; I told him so. He hid everything from my mother, and\nconfided only in me.\"\n\n\"You spoke to him of me?\" said Popinot; \"you have read my heart? Have\nyou read all that is there?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"I am very happy,\" said Popinot. \"If you would lighten all my fears--in\na year I shall be so prosperous that your father cannot object when I\nspeak to him of our marriage. From henceforth I shall sleep only five\nhours a night.\"\n\n\"Do not injure yourself,\" said Cesarine, with an inexpressible accent\nand a look in which Popinot was suffered to read her thoughts.\n\n\"Wife,\" said Cesar, as they rose from table, \"I think those young people\nlove each other.\"\n\n\"Well, so much the better,\" said Constance, in a grave voice; \"my\ndaughter will be the wife of a man of sense and energy. Talent is the\nbest dower a man can offer.\"\n\nShe left the room hastily and went to Madame Ragon's bedchamber. Cesar\nduring the dinner had make various fatuous remarks, which caused the\njudge and Pillerault to smile, and reminded the unhappy woman of how\nunfitted her poor husband was to grapple with misfortune. Her heart was\nfull of tears; and she instinctively dreaded du Tillet, for every mother\nknows the _Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes_, even if she does not know\nLatin. Constance wept in the arms of Madame Ragon and her daughter,\nthough she would not tell them the cause of her distress.\n\n\"I'm nervous,\" she said.\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent by the elders at the card-table, and\nby the young people in those little games called innocent because they\ncover the innocent by-play of bourgeois love. The Matifats joined in\nthese games.\n\n\"Cesar,\" said Constance as they drove home, \"go and see Monsieur le\nBaron de Nucingen on the 8th so as to be sure of having your payments\nready in advance of the 15th. If there should be any hitch, how could\nyou scrape the money together if you have only one day to do it in?\"\n\n\"I will see to it, wife,\" said Cesar, pressing his wife's hand and his\ndaughter's, adding, \"Ah, my dear white lambs, I have given you a sad New\nYear's gift!\"\n\nThe two women, unable to see him in the obscurity of the hackney coach,\nfelt his tears falling hot upon their hands.\n\n\"Be hopeful, dear friend,\" said Constance.\n\n\"All will go well, papa; Monsieur Anselme Popinot told me he would shed\nhis blood for you.\"\n\n\"For me?\" said Cesar, trying to speak gaily; \"and for the family as\nwell. Isn't it so?\"\n\nCesarine pressed her father's hand, as if to let him know she was\nbetrothed to Anselme.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nDuring the first three days of the year, two hundred visiting cards\nwere sent to Birotteau. This rush of fictitious friendship, these empty\ntestimonials of favor, are horrible to those who feel themselves drawn\ndown into the vortex of misfortune. Birotteau presented himself three\ntimes at the hotel of the famous banker, the Baron de Nucingen, but\nin vain. The opening of the year with all its festivities sufficiently\nexplained the absences of the financier. On the last occasion Birotteau\ngot as far as the office of the banker, where the head-clerk, a German,\ntold him that Monsieur de Nucingen had returned at five in the morning\nfrom a ball at the Kellers', and would not be visible until half-past\nnine o'clock. Birotteau had the luck to interest this man in his\naffairs, and remained talking with him more than half an hour. In the\ncourse of the afternoon this prime minister of the house of Nucingen\nwrote Birotteau that the baron would receive him the next day, 13th, at\nnoon. Though every hour brought its drop of absinthe, the day went by\nwith frightful rapidity. Cesar took a hackney coach, but stopped it\nseveral paces distant from the hotel, whose courtyard was crowded\nwith carriages. The poor man's heart sank within him when he saw the\nsplendors of that noted house.\n\n\"And yet he has failed twice,\" he said to himself as he went up a superb\nstaircase banked with flowers, and crossed the sumptuous rooms which\nhelped to make Madame Delphine de Nucingen famous in the Chaussee\nd'Antin. The baronne's ambition was to rival the great ladies of the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain, to whose houses she was not as yet admitted. The\nbaron was breakfasting with his wife. In spite of the crowd which was\nwaiting for him in the counting-room, he had left word that any friend\nof du Tillet was to be admitted. Birotteau trembled with hope as he\nnoticed the change which the baron's order had wrought in the hitherto\ninsolent manner of the footman.\n\n\"Pardon me, my tear,\" said the baron to his wife, in a strong German\naccent, as he rose and nodded to Birotteau, \"monsieur is a good\nroyalist, and der intimate frient of tu Tillet. Bezides, monsieur is\ndebudy-mayor of der zecond arrondissement, and gifs palls of Aziatigue\nmagnifissence; so vill you mak his acquentence mit blaysure.\"\n\n\"I should be delighted to take lessons from Madame Birotteau, for\nFerdinand--\"\n\n\"She calls him Ferdinand!\" thought Cesar.\n\n\"--spoke of the ball with great admiration, which is all the more\nvaluable because he usually admires nothing. Ferdinand is a harsh\ncritic; in his eyes everything ought to be perfect. Shall you soon give\nanother ball?\" she inquired affably.\n\n\"Madame, poor people, such as we are, seldom have many amusements of\nthat kind,\" said the perfumer, not knowing whether she meant to ridicule\nhim, or was merely paying an empty compliment.\n\n\"Monsieur Grindot suberintented der resdoration of your abbartement, I\nzink?\" said the baron.\n\n\"Ah, Grindot! that nice little architect who has just returned from\nRome,\" said Delphine de Nucingen. \"I dote on him; he makes delicious\ndrawings in my album.\"\n\nNo culprit enduring the torments of hell in Venetian dungeons ever\nsuffered more from the torture of the boot than Birotteau did, standing\nthere in his ordinary clothes. He felt a sneer in every word.\n\n\"Vill you gif oder little palls?\" said the banker, with a searching look\nat the perfumer. \"You see all der vorld ist inderesded.\"\n\n\"Will Monsieur Birotteau breakfast with us, without ceremony?\" said\nDelphine, motioning towards the table which was sumptuously served.\n\n\"Madame la baronne, I came on business, and I am--\"\n\n\"Yes, matame, vill you bermit us to speak of business?\"\n\nDelphine made a little sign of assent, saying to her husband, \"Are you\ngoing to buy perfumery?\" The baron shrugged his shoulders and turned to\nCesar, who trembled with anxiety.\n\n\"Tu Tillet takes der graadest inderest in you,\" he said.\n\n\"At last,\" thought the poor man, \"we are coming to the point.\"\n\n\"His ledder gif you in my house a creydit vich is only limided by der\nlimids of my privade fortune.\"\n\nThe exhilarating balm infused into the water offered by the angel\nto Hagar in the desert, must have been the same cordial which flowed\nthrough Cesar's veins as he listened to these words. The wily banker\nretained the horrible pronunciation of the German Jews,--possibly\nthat he might be able to deny promises actually given, but only\nhalf-understood.\n\n\"You shall haf a running aggont. Ve vill broceed in dis vay--\" said this\ngreat and good and venerable financier, with Alsatian good-humor.\n\nBirotteau doubted no longer; he was a merchant, and new very well that\nthose who have no intention of rendering a service never enter into the\ndetails of executing it.\n\n\"I neet not tell you dat der Bank demands of all, graat and small\nalaike, dree zignatures. So denn, you traw a cheque to die order of our\nfrient tu Tillet, and I vill sent it, same tay, to der Bank mit mein\nzignature; so shall you haf, at four o'clock, der amount of die cheque\nyou trew in der morning; and at der costs of die Bank. I vill not receif\na commission, no! I vill haf only der blaysure to be agreeaple to you.\nBut I mak one condeetion,\" he added, laying his left finger lightly on\nhis nose with an inimitably sly gesture.\n\n\"Monsieur le baron, it is granted on the sport,\" said Birotteau, who\nthought it concerned some tithe to be levied on his profits.\n\n\"A condeetion to vich I attache der graatest imbortance, because I vish\nMatame de Nucingen should receif, as she say, zom lessons from Matame\nPirodot.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron! pray do not laugh at me, I entreat you.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Pirodot,\" said the financier, with a serious air, \"it is deen\nagreet; you vill invite us to your nex pall? My vife is shalous; she\nvish to see your abbartement, of vich she hear so mooch.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron!--\"\n\n\"Oh! if you reffuse me, no creydit! Yes, I know der Prayfic of die Seine\nwas at your las pall.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron!--\"\n\n\"You had Pillartiere, shentelman of der betchamber; goot royalist like\nyou, who vas vounded at Zaint-Roqque--\"\n\n\"On the 13th Vendemiaire, Monsieur le baron.\"\n\n\"Denn you hat Monsieur de Lazabed, Monsieur Fauquelin of der Agatemi--\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron!--\"\n\n\"Hey! der tefle! dont pe zo humple, Monsieur der debudy-mayor; I haf\nheard dat der king say dat your ball--\"\n\n\"The king?\" exclaimed Birotteau, who was destined to hear no more, for,\nat this moment, a young man entered the room familiarly, whose step,\nrecognized from afar by the beautiful Delphine de Nucingen, brought the\ncolor to her cheek.\n\n\"Goot morning, my tear te Marsay; tak my blace. Dere is a crowd, zey\ntell me, waiting in der gounting-room. I know vy. Der mines of Wortschin\nbay a graat divitent! I haf receifed die aggonts. You vill haf one\nhundert tousant francs, Matame de Nucingen, so you can buy chewels and\noder tings to make you bretty,--as if you could be brettier!\"\n\n\"Good God! the Ragons sold their shares!\" exclaimed Birotteau.\n\n\"Who are those persons?\" asked the elegant de Marsay, smiling.\n\n\"Egzactly,\" said Monsieur de Nucingen, turning back when he was almost\nat the door. \"I zink tat dose persons--te Marsay, dis is Monsieur\nPirodot, your berfumer, who gifs palls of a magnifissence druly\nAziatique, and whom der king has decoraded.\"\n\nDe Marsay lifted his eyeglass, and said, \"Ah! true, I thought the face\nwas not unknown to me. So you are going to perfume your affairs with\npotent cosmetics, oil them with--\"\n\n\"Ah! dose Rakkons,\" interrupted the baron, making a grimace expressive\nof disgust; \"dey had an aggont mit us; I fafored dem, and dey could haf\nmade der fortune, but dey would not wait one zingle day longer.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron!\" cried Birotteau.\n\nThe worthy man thought his own prospects extremely doubtful, and without\nbowing to Madame de Nucingen, or to de Marsay, he hastily followed the\nbanker. The baron was already on the staircase, and Birotteau caught\nhim at the bottom just as he was about to enter the counting-room.\nAs Nucingen opened the door he saw the despairing gesture of the poor\ncreature behind him, who felt himself pushed into a gulf, and said\nhastily,--\n\n\"Vell, it is all agreet. See tu Tillet, and arranche it mit him.\"\n\nBirotteau, thinking that de Marsay might have some influence with\nNucingen, ran back with the rapidity of a swallow, and slipped into the\ndining-room where he had left the baronne and the young man, and where\nDelphine was waiting for a cup of _cafe a la creme_. He saw that the\ncoffee had been served, but the baronne and the dandy had disappeared.\nThe footman smiled at the astonishment of the worthy man, who slowly\nre-descended the stairs. Cesar rushed to du Tillet's, and was told that\nhe had gone into the country with Madame Roguin. He took a cabriolet,\nand paid the driver well to be taken rapidly to Nogent-sur-Marne.\nAt Nogent-sur-Marne the porter told him that monsieur and madame had\nstarted for Paris. Birotteau returned home, shattered in mind and body.\nWhen he related his wild-goose chase to his wife and daughter he was\namazed to find his Constance, usually perched like a bird of ill omen\non the smallest commercial mishap, now giving him the tenderest\nconsolation, and assuring him that everything would turn out well.\n\nThe next morning, Birotteau mounted guard as early as seven o'clock\nbefore du Tillet's door. He begged the porter, slipping ten francs\ninto his hand, to put him in communication with du Tillet's valet, and\nobtained from the latter a promise to show him in to his master the\nmoment that du Tillet was visible: he slid two pieces of gold into the\nvalet's hand. By such little sacrifices and great humiliations, common\nto all courtiers and petitioners, he was able to attain his end.\nAt half-past eight, just as his former clerk was putting on a\ndressing-gown, yawning, stretching, and shaking off the cobwebs of\nsleep, Birotteau came face to face with the tiger, hungry for revenge,\nwhom he now looked upon as his only friend.\n\n\"Go on with your dressing,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"What do you want, _my good Cesar_?\" said du Tillet.\n\nCesar stated, with painful trepidation, the answer and requirements\nof Monsieur de Nucingen to the inattentive ears of du Tillet, who was\nlooking for the bellows and scolding his valet for the clumsy manner in\nwhich he had lighted the fire.\n\nThe valet listened. At first Cesar did not notice him; when he did so\nhe stopped short, confused, but resumed what he was saying as du Tillet\ntouched him with the spur exclaiming, \"Go on! go on! I am listening to\nyou.\"\n\nThe poor man's shirt was wet; his perspiration turned to ice as du\nTillet looked fixedly at him, and he saw the silver-lined pupils of\nthose eyes, streaked with threads of gold, which pierced to his very\nheart with a diabolical gleam.\n\n\"My dear master, the Bank has refused to take your notes which the house\nof Claparon passed over to Gigonnet _not guaranteed_. Is that my\nfault? How is it that you, an old commercial judge, should commit such\nblunders? I am, first and foremost, a banker. I will give you my money,\nbut I cannot risk having my signature refused at the Bank. My credit is\nmy life; that is the case with all of us. Do you want money?\"\n\n\"Can you give me what I want?\"\n\n\"That depends on how much you owe. How much do you want?\"\n\n\"Thirty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Are the chimney-bricks coming down on my head?\" exclaimed du Tillet,\nbursting into a laugh.\n\nCesar, misled by the luxury about him, fancied it was the laugh of a man\nto whom the sum was a mere trifle; he breathed again. Du Tillet rang the\nbell.\n\n\"Send the cashier to me.\"\n\n\"He has not come, monsieur,\" said the valet.\n\n\"These fellows take advantage of me! It is half-past eight o'clock, and\nhe ought to have done a million francs' worth of business by this time.\"\n\nFive minutes later Monsieur Legras came in.\n\n\"How much have we in the desk?\"\n\n\"Only twenty thousand francs. Monsieur gave orders to buy into the Funds\nto the amount of thirty thousand francs cash, payable on the 15th.\"\n\n\"That's true; I am half-asleep still.\"\n\nThe cashier gave Birotteau a suspicious look as he left the room.\n\n\"If truth were banished from this earth, she would leave her last word\nwith a cashier,\" said du Tillet. \"Haven't you some interest in this\nlittle Popinot, who has set up for himself?\" he added, after a dreadful\npause, in which the sweat rolled in drops from Cesar's brow.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, naively. \"Do you think you could discount his\nsignature for a large amount?\"\n\n\"Bring me his acceptances for fifty thousand francs, and I will get them\ndiscounted for you at a reasonable rate by old Gobseck, who is very easy\nto deal with when he has funds to invest; and he has some now.\"\n\nBirotteau went home broken-hearted, not perceiving that the bankers were\ntossing him from one to the other like a shuttle-cock; but Constance had\nalready guessed that credit was unattainable. If three bankers refused\nit, it was very certain that they had inquired of each other about so\nprominent a man as a deputy-mayor; and there was, consequently, no hope\nfrom the Bank of France.\n\n\"Try to renew your notes,\" she said; \"go and see Monsieur Claparon, your\ncopartner, and all the others to whom you gave notes for the 15th, and\nask them to renew. It will be time enough to go to the money-lenders\nwith Popinot's paper if that fails.\"\n\n\"To-morrow is the 13th,\" said Birotteau, completely crushed.\n\nIn the language of his own prospectus, he enjoyed a sanguine\ntemperament, which was subject to an enormous waste through emotions and\nthe pressure of thought, and imperatively demanded sleep to repair it.\nCesarine took her father into the salon and played to him \"Rousseau's\nDream,\"--a pretty piece of music by Herold; while Constance sat sewing\nbeside him. The poor man laid his head on a cushion, and every time he\nlooked up at his wife he saw a soft smile upon her lips; and thus he\nfell asleep.\n\n\"Poor man!\" said Constance; \"what misery is in store for him! God grant\nhe may have strength to bear it!\"\n\n\"Oh! what troubles you, mamma?\" said Cesarine, seeing that her mother\nwas weeping.\n\n\"Dear daughter, I see a failure coming. If your father is forced to\nmake an assignment, we must ask no one's pity. My child, be prepared\nto become a simple shop-girl. If I see you accepting your life\ncourageously, I shall have strength to begin my life over again. I know\nyour father,--he will not keep back one farthing; I shall resign my\ndower; all that we possess will be sold. My child, you must take your\njewels and your clothes to-morrow to your uncle Pillerault; for you are\nnot bound to any sacrifice.\"\n\nCesarine was seized with a terror beyond control as she listened to\nthese words, spoken with religious simplicity. The thought came into her\nmind to go and see Anselme; but her native delicacy checked it.\n\nOn the morrow, at nine o'clock, Birotteau, following his wife's advice,\nwent to find Claparon in the Rue de Provence, in the grasp of anxieties\nquite other than those through which he had lately passed. To ask for a\ncredit is an ordinary business matter; it happens every day that those\nwho undertake an enterprise are obliged to borrow capital; but to\nask for the renewal of notes is in commercial jurisprudence what the\ncorrectional police is to the court of assizes,--a first step towards\nbankruptcy, just as a misdemeanor leads to crime. The secret of your\nembarrassment is in other hands than your own. A merchant delivers\nhimself over, bound hand and foot, to another merchant; and mercy is a\nvirtue not practised at the Bourse.\n\nCesar, who once walked the streets of Paris with his head high and his\neye beaming with confidence, now, unstrung by perplexity, shrank from\nmeeting Claparon; he began to realize that a banker's heart is mere\nviscera. Claparon had seemed to him so brutal in his coarse jollity,\nand he had felt the man's vulgarity so keenly, that he shuddered at the\nnecessity of accosting him.\n\n\"But he is nearer to the people; perhaps he will therefore have more\nheart!\" Such was the first reproachful word which the anguish of his\nposition forced from Cesar's lips.\n\nBirotteau drew upon the dregs of his courage, and went up the stairway\nof a mean little _entresol_, at whose windows he had caught a glimpse of\ngreen curtains yellowed by the sun. He read the word \"Offices,\" stamped\nin black letters on an oval copper-plate; he rapped, nobody answered,\nand he went in. The place, worse than humble, conveyed an idea of\npenury, or avarice, or neglect. No employe was to be seen behind\nthe brass lattice which topped an unpainted white wooden enclosure,\nbreast-high, within which were tables and desks in stained black wood.\nThese deserted places were littered with inkstands, in which the ink was\nmouldy and the pens as rumpled as a ragammufin's head, and twisted like\nsunfish; with boxes and papers and printed matter,--all worthless,\nno doubt. The floor was as dirty, defaced, and damp as that of a\nboarding-house. The second room, announced by the word \"Counting-Room\"\non its door, harmonized with the grim _facetiae_ of its neighbor. In one\ncorner was a large space screened off by an oak balustrade, trellised\nwith copper wire and furnished with a sliding cat-hole, within which was\nan enormous iron chest. This space, apparently given over to the rioting\nof rats, also contained an odd-looking desk, with a shabby arm-chair,\nwhich was ragged, green, and torn in the seat,--from which the\nhorse-hair protruded, like the wig of its master, in half a hundred\nlibertine curls. The chief adornment of this room, which had evidently\nbeen the salon of the appartement before it was converted into a\nbanking-office, was a round table covered with a green cloth, round\nwhich stood a few old chairs of black leather with tarnished gilt nails.\nThe fireplace, somewhat elegant, showed none of the sooty marks of a\nfire; the hearth was clean; the mirror, covered with fly-specks, had a\npaltry air, in keeping with a mahogany clock bought at the sale of some\nold notary, which annoyed the eye, already depressed by two candelabras\nwithout candles and the sticky dust that covered them. The wall-paper,\nmouse-gray with a pink border, revealed, by certain fuliginous stains,\nthe unwholesome presence of smokers. Nothing ever more faithfully\nrepresented that prosaic precinct called by the newspapers an \"editorial\nsanctum.\" Birotteau, fearing that he might be indiscreet, knocked\nsharply three times on the door opposite to that by which he entered.\n\n\"Come in!\" cried Claparon, the reverberation of whose voice revealed\nthe distance it had to traverse and the emptiness of the room,--in\nwhich Cesar heard the crackling of a good fire, though the owner was\napparently not there.\n\nThe room was, in truth, Claparon's private office. Between the\nostentatious reception-room of Francois Keller and the untidy abode of\nthe counterfeit banker, there was all the difference that exists between\nVersailles and the wigwam of a Huron chief. Birotteau had witnessed the\nsplendors of finance; he was now to see its fooleries. Lying in bed,\nin a sort of oblong recess or den opening from the farther end of the\noffice, and where the habits of a slovenly life had spoiled, dirtied,\ngreased, torn, defaced, obliterated, and ruined furniture which had been\nelegant in its day, Claparon, at the entrance of Birotteau, wrapped his\nfilthy dressing-gown around him, laid down his pipe, and drew together\nthe curtains of the bed with a haste which made even the innocent\nperfumer suspect his morals.\n\n\"Sit down, monsieur,\" said the make-believe banker.\n\nClaparon, without his wig, his head wrapped up in a bandanna\nhandkerchief twisted awry, seemed all the more hideous to Birotteau\nbecause, when the dressing-gown gaped open, he saw an undershirt\nof knitted wool, once white, but now yellowed by wear indefinitely\nprolonged.\n\n\"Will you breakfast with me?\" said Claparon, recollecting the perfumer's\nball, and thinking to make him a return and also to put him off the\nscent by this invitation.\n\nCesar now perceived a round table, hastily cleared of its litter, which\nbore testimony to the presence of jovial company by a pate, oysters,\nwhite wine, and vulgar kidneys, _sautes au vin de champagne_, sodden in\ntheir own sauce. The light of a charcoal brazier gleamed on an _omelette\naux truffes_.\n\nTwo covers and two napkins, soiled by the supper of the previous night,\nmight have enlightened the purest innocence. Claparon, thinking himself\nvery clever, pressed his invitation in spite of Cesar's refusal.\n\n\"I was to have had a guest, but that guest has disappointed me,\" said\nthe crafty traveller, in a voice likely to reach a person buried under\ncoverlets.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Birotteau, \"I came solely on business, and I shall not\ndetain you long.\"\n\n\"I'm used up,\" said Claparon, pointing to the desk and the tables piled\nwith documents; \"they don't leave me a poor miserable moment to myself!\nI don't receive people except on Saturdays. But as for you, my dear\nfriend, I'll see you at any time. I haven't a moment to love or to loaf;\nI have lost even the inspiration of business; to catch its vim one must\nhave the sloth of ease. Nobody ever sees me now on the boulevard doing\nnothing. Bah! I'm sick of business; I don't want to talk about business;\nI've got money enough, but I never can get enough happiness. My\ngracious! I want to travel,--to see Italy! Oh, that dear Italy!\nbeautiful in spite of all her reverses! adorable land, where I shall no\ndoubt encounter some angel, complying yet majestic! I have always loved\nItalian women. Did you ever have an Italian woman yourself? No?\nThen come with me to Italy. We will see Venice, the abode of\ndoges,--unfortunately fallen into those intelligent Austrian hands that\nknow nothing of art! Bah! let us get rid of business, canals, loans, and\npeaceful governments. I'm a good fellow when I've got my pockets lined.\nThunder! let's travel.\"\n\n\"One word, monsieur, and I will release you,\" said Birotteau. \"You made\nover my notes to Monsieur Bidault.\"\n\n\"You mean Gigonnet, that good little Gigonnet, easy-going--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cesar; \"but I wish,--and here I count upon your honor and\ndelicacy,--\"\n\nClaparon bowed.\n\n\"--to renew those notes.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" snapped the banker. \"I'm not alone in the matter. We have\nmet in council,--regular Chamber; but we all agreed like bacon in a\nfrying-pan. The devil! we deliberated. Those lands about the Madeleine\ndon't amount to anything; we are operating elsewhere. Hey! my dear sir,\nif we were not involved in the Champs Elysees and at the Bourse which\nthey are going to finish, and in the quartier Saint-Lazare and at\nTivoli, we shouldn't be, as that fat Nucingen says, in _peaseness_ at\nall. What's the Madeleine to us?--a midge of a thing. Pr-r-r! We don't\nplay low, my good fellow,\" he said, tapping Birotteau on the stomach\nand catching him round the waist. \"Come, let's have our breakfast, and\ntalk,\" added Claparon, wishing to soften his refusal.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Birotteau. \"So much the worse for the other guest,\"\nhe thought, meaning to make Claparon drunk, and to find out who were his\nreal associates in an affair which began to look suspicious to him.\n\n\"All right! Victoire!\" called the banker.\n\nThis call brought a regular Leonarde, tricked out like a fish-woman.\n\n\"Tell the clerks that I can't see any one,--not even Nucingen, Keller,\nGigonnet, and all the rest of them.\"\n\n\"No one has come but Monsieur Lempereur.\"\n\n\"He can receive the great people,\" said Claparon; \"the small fry are\nnot to get beyond the first room. They are to say I'm cogitating a great\nenterprise--in champagne.\"\n\nTo make an old commercial traveller drunk is an impossibility. Cesar\nmistook the elation of the man's vulgarity when he attempted to sound\nhis mind.\n\n\"That infamous Roguin is still connected with you,\" he began; \"don't you\nthink you ought to write and tell him to assist an old friend whom he\nhas compromised,--a man with whom he dined every Sunday, and whom he has\nknown for twenty years?\"\n\n\"Roguin? A fool! his share is ours now. Don't be worried, old fellow,\nall will go well. Pay up to the 15th, and after that we will see--I say,\nwe will see. Another glass of wine? The capital doesn't concern me one\natom; pay or don't pay, I sha'n't make faces at you. I'm only in the\nbusiness for a commission on the sales, and for a share when the lands\nare converted into money; and it's for that I manage the owners. Don't\nyou understand? You have got solid men behind you, so I'm not afraid, my\ngood sir. Nowadays, business is all parcelled out in portions. A single\nenterprise requires a combination of capacities. Go in with us; don't\npotter with pomatum and perfumes,--rubbish! rubbish! Shave the public;\nspeculate!\"\n\n\"Speculation!\" said Cesar, \"is that commerce?\"\n\n\"It is abstract commerce,\" said Claparon,--\"commerce which won't be\ndeveloped for ten years to come, according to Nucingen, the Napoleon of\nfinance; commerce by which a man can grasp the totality of fractions,\nand skim the profits before there are any. Gigantic idea! one way of\npouring hope into pint cups,--in short, a new necromancy! So far, we\nhave only got ten or a dozen hard heads initiated into the cabalistic\nsecrets of these magnificent combinations.\"\n\nCesar opened his eyes and ears, endeavoring to understand this composite\nphraseology.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Claparon, after a pause. \"Such master-strokes need men.\nThere's the man of genius who hasn't a sou--like all men of genius.\nThose fellows spend their thoughts and spend their money just as it\ncomes. Imagine a pig rooting round a truffle-patch; he is followed by\na jolly fellow, a moneyed man, who listens for the grunt as piggy finds\nthe succulent. Now, when the man of genius has found a good thing, the\nmoneyed man taps him on the shoulder and says, 'What have you got there?\nYou are rushing into the fiery furnace, my good fellow, and you haven't\nthe loins to run out again. There's a thousand francs; just let me take\nit in hand and manage the affair.' Very good! The banker then convokes\nthe traders: 'My friends, let us go to work: write a prospectus! Down\nwith humbug!' On that they get out the hunting-horns and shout and\nclamor,--'One hundred thousand francs for five sous! or five sous for\na hundred thousand francs! gold mines! coal mines!' In short, all the\nclap-trap of commerce. We buy up men of arts and sciences; the show\nbegins, the public enters; it gets its money's worth, and we get the\nprofits. The pig is penned up with his potatoes, and the rest of us\nwallow in banknotes. There it all is, my good sir. Come, go into the\nbusiness with us. What would you like to be,--pig, buzzard, clown,\nor millionaire? Reflect upon it; I have now laid before you the whole\ntheory of the modern loan-system. Come and see me often; you'll always\nfind me a jovial, jolly fellow. French joviality--gaiety and gravity,\nall in one--never injures business; quite the contrary. Men who quaff\nthe sparkling cup are born to understand each other. Come, another glass\nof champagne! it is good, I tell you! It was sent to me from Epernay\nitself, by a man for whom I once sold quantities at a good price--I\nused to be in wines. He shows his gratitude, and remembers me in my\nprosperity; very rare, that.\"\n\nBirotteau, overcome by the frivolity and heedlessness of a man to whom\nthe world attributed extreme depth and capacity, dared not question him\nany further. In the midst of his own haziness of mind produced by the\nchampagne, he did, however, recollect a name spoken by du Tillet; and he\nasked Claparon who Gobseck the banker was, and where he lived.\n\n\"Have you got as far as that?\" said Claparon. \"Gobseck is a banker,\njust as the headsman is a doctor. The first word is 'fifty per cent'; he\nbelongs to the race of Harpagon; he'll take canary birds at all seasons,\nfur tippets in summer, nankeens in winter. What securities are you going\nto offer him? If you want him to take your paper without security you\nwill have to deposit your wife, your daughter, your umbrella, everything\ndown to your hat-box, your socks (don't you go in for ribbed socks?),\nyour shovel and tongs, and the very wood you've got in the cellar!\nGobseck! Gobseck! in the name of virtuous folly, who told you to go to\nthat commercial guillotine?\"\n\n\"Monsieur du Tillet.\"\n\n\"Ah! the scoundrel, I recognize him! We used to be friends. If we have\nquarrelled so that we don't speak to each other, you may depend upon it\nmy aversion to him is well-founded; he let me read down to the bottom of\nhis infamous soul, and he made me uncomfortable at that beautiful ball\nyou gave us. I can't stand his impudent airs--all because he has got\na notary's wife! I could have countesses if I wanted them; I sha'n't\nrespect him any the more for that. Ah! my respect is a princess who'll\nnever give birth to such as he. But, I say, you are a funny fellow, old\nman, to flash us a ball like that, and two months after try to renew\nyour paper! You seem to have some go in you. Let's do business together.\nYou have got a reputation which would be very useful to me. Oh! du\nTillet was born to understand Gobseck. Du Tillet will come to a bad end\nat the Bourse. If he is, as they say, the tool of old Gobseck, he won't\nbe allowed to go far. Gobseck sits in a corner of his web like an old\nspider who has travelled round the world. Sooner or later, ztit! the\nusurer will toss him off as I do this glass of wine. So much the better!\nDu Tillet has played me a trick--oh! a damnable trick.\"\n\nAt the end of an hour and a half spend in just such senseless chatter,\nBirotteau attempted to get away, seeing that the late commercial\ntraveller was about to relate the adventure of a republican deputy of\nMarseilles, in love with a certain actress then playing the part of la\nbelle Arsene, who, on one occasion, was hissed by a royalist crowd in\nthe pit.\n\n\"He stood up in his box,\" said Claparon, \"and shouted: 'Arrest whoever\nhissed her! Eugh! If it's a woman, I'll kiss her; if it's a man, we'll\nsee about it; if it's neither the one nor the other, may God's lightning\nblast it!' Guess how it ended.\"\n\n\"Adieu, monsieur,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"You will have to come and see me,\" said Claparon; \"that first scrap of\npaper you gave Cayron has come back to us protested; I endorsed it, so\nI've paid it. I shall send after you; business before everything.\"\n\nBirotteau felt stabbed to the heart by this cold and grinning kindness\nas much as by the harshness of Keller or the coarse German banter of\nNucingen. The familiarity of the man, and his grotesque gabble excited\nby champagne, seemed to tarnish the soul of the honest bourgeois as\nthough he came from a house of financial ill-fame. He went down the\nstairway and found himself in the streets without knowing where he\nwas going. As he walked along the boulevards and reached the Rue\nSaint-Denis, he recollected Molineux, and turned into the Cour Batave.\nHe went up the dirty, tortuous staircase which he once trod so proudly.\nHe recalled to mind the mean and niggardly acrimony of Molineux, and\nhe shrank from imploring his favor. The landlord was sitting in the\nchimney-corner, as on the occasion of Cesar's first visit, but his\nbreakfast was now in process of digestion. Birotteau proffered his\nrequest.\n\n\"Renew a note for twelve hundred francs?\" said Molineux, with mocking\nincredulity. \"Have you got to that, monsieur? If you have not twelve\nhundred francs to pay me on the 15th, do you intend to send back my\nreceipt for the rent unpaid? I shall be sorry; but I have not the\nsmallest civility in money-matters,--my rents are my living. Without\nthem how could I pay what I owe myself? No merchant will deny the\nsoundness of that principle. Money is no respecter of persons; money has\nno ears, it has no heart. The winter is hard, the price of wood has gone\nup. If you don't pay me on the 15th, a little summons will be served\nupon you at twelve o'clock on the 16th. Bah! the worthy Mitral, your\nbailiff, is mine as well; he will send you the writ in an envelope, with\nall the consideration due to your high position.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I have never received a summons in my life,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"There is a beginning to everything,\" said Molineux.\n\nDismayed by the curt malevolence of the old man, Cesar was cowed; he\nheard the knell of failure ringing in his ears, and every jangle woke\na memory of the stern sayings his pitiless justice had uttered against\nbankrupts. His former opinions now seared, as with fire, the soft\nsubstance of his brain.\n\n\"By the by,\" said Molineux, \"you neglected to put upon your notes, 'for\nvalue received in rental,' which would secure me preference.\"\n\n\"My position will prevent me from doing anything to the detriment of\nmy creditors,\" said Cesar, stunned by the sudden sight of the precipice\nyawning before him.\n\n\"Very good, monsieur, very good; I thought I knew everything relating to\nrentals and tenants, but I have learned through you never to take notes\nin payment. Ah! I shall sue you, for your answer shows plainly enough\nthat you are not going to meet your liabilities. Hard cash is a matter\nwhich concerns every landlord in Paris.\"\n\nBirotteau went out, weary of life. It is in the nature of such soft\nand tender souls to be disheartened by a first rebuff, just as a first\nsuccess encourages them. Cesar no longer had any hope except in the\ndevotion of little Popinot, to whom his thoughts naturally turned as he\ncrossed the Marche des Innocents.\n\n\"Poor boy! who could have believed it when I launched him, only six\nweeks ago, in the Tuileries?\"\n\nIt was just four o'clock, the hour at which the judges left their\ncourt-rooms. Popinot the elder chanced to go and see his nephew. This\njudge, whose mind was singularly acute on all moral questions, was\nalso gifted with a second-sight which enabled him to discover secret\nintentions, to perceive the meaning of insignificant human actions, the\ngerms of crime, the roots of wrongdoing; and he now watched Birotteau,\nthough Birotteau was not aware of it. The perfumer, who was annoyed at\nfinding the judge with his nephew, seemed to him harassed, preoccupied,\npensive. Little Popinot, always busy, with his pen behind his ear, lay\ndown as usual flat on his stomach before the father of his Cesarine. The\nempty phrases which Cesar addressed to his partner seemed to the judge\nto mask some important request. Instead of going away, the crafty old\nman stayed in spite of his nephew's evident desire, for he guessed that\nthe perfumer would soon try to get rid of him by going away himself.\nAccordingly, when Birotteau went out the judge followed, and saw\nBirotteau hanging about that part of the Rue des Cinq-Diamants which\nleads into the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher. This trifling circumstance roused\nthe suspicions of old Popinot as to Cesar's intentions; he turned into\nthe Rue des Lombards, and when he saw the perfumer re-enter Anselme's\ndoor, he came hastily back again.\n\n\"My dear Popinot,\" said Cesar to his partner, \"I have come to ask a\nservice of you.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" cried Popinot with generous ardor.\n\n\"Ah! you save my life,\" exclaimed the poor man, comforted by this\nwarmth of heart which flamed upon the sea of ice he had traversed for\ntwenty-five days.\n\n\"You must give me a note for fifty thousand francs on my share of the\nprofits; we will arrange later about the payment.\"\n\nPopinot looked fixedly at Cesar. Cesar dropped his eyes. At this moment\nthe judge re-entered.\n\n\"My son--ah! excuse me, Monsieur Birotteau--Anselme, I forget to tell\nyou--\" and with an imperious gesture he led his nephew into the street\nand forced him, in his shirt-sleeves and bareheaded, to listen as they\nwalked towards the Rue des Lombards. \"My nephew, your old master may\nfind himself so involved that he will be forced to make an assignment.\nBefore taking that step, honorable men who have forty years of integrity\nto boast of, virtuous men seeking to save their good name, will play the\npart of reckless gamblers; they become capable of anything; they will\nsell their wives, traffic with their daughters, compromise their\nbest friends, pawn what does not belong to them; they will frequent\ngambling-tables, become dissemblers, hypocrites, liars; they will even\nshed tears. I have witnessed strange things. You yourself have seen\nRoguin's respectability,--a man to whom they would have given the\nsacraments without confession. I do not apply these remarks in their\nfull force to Monsieur Birotteau,--I believe him to be an honest man;\nbut if he asks you to do anything, no matter what, against the rules of\nbusiness, such as endorsing notes out of good-nature, or launching into\na system of 'circulations,' which, to my mind, is the first step to\nswindling,--for it is uttering counterfeit paper-money,--if he asks\nyou to do anything of the kind, promise me that you will sign nothing\nwithout consulting me. Remember that if you love his daughter you must\nnot--in the very interests of your love you must not--destroy your\nfuture. If Monsieur Birotteau is to fall, what will it avail if you fall\ntoo? You will deprive yourselves, one as much as the other, of all the\nchances of your new business, which may prove his only refuge.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my uncle; a word to the wise is enough,\" said Popinot, to\nwhom Cesar's heart-rending exclamation was now explained.\n\nThe merchant in oils, refined and otherwise, returned to his gloomy shop\nwith an anxious brow. Birotteau saw the change.\n\n\"Will you do me the honor to come up into my bedroom? We shall be better\nthere. The clerks, though very busy, might overhear us.\"\n\nBirotteau followed Popinot, a prey to the anxiety a condemned man goes\nthrough from the moment of his appeal for mercy until its rejection.\n\n\"My dear benefactor,\" said Anselme, \"you cannot doubt my devotion; it is\nabsolute. Permit me only to ask you one thing. Will this sum clear you\nentirely, or is it only a means of delaying some catastrophe? If it\nis that, what good will it do to drag me down also? You want notes at\nninety days. Well, it is absolutely impossible that I could meet them in\nthat time.\"\n\nBirotteau rose, pale and solemn, and looked at Popinot.\n\nPopinot, horror-struck, cried out, \"I will do them for you, if you wish\nit.\"\n\n\"UNGRATEFUL!\" said his master, who spent his whole remaining strength\nin hurling the word at Anselme's brow, as if it were a living mark of\ninfamy.\n\nBirotteau walked to the door, and went out. Popinot, rousing himself\nfrom the sensation which the terrible word produced upon him, rushed\ndown the staircase and into the street, but Birotteau was out of sight.\nCesarine's lover heard that dreadful charge ringing in his ears, and saw\nthe distorted face of the poor distracted Cesar constantly before him;\nPopinot was to live henceforth, like Hamlet, with a spectre beside him.\n\nBirotteau wandered about the streets of the neighborhood like a drunken\nman. At last he found himself upon the quay, and followed it till he\nreached Sevres, where he passed the night at an inn, maddened with\ngrief, while his terrified wife dared not send in search of him. She\nknew that in such circumstances an alarm, imprudently given, might be\nfatal to his credit, and the wise Constance sacrificed her own anxiety\nto her husband's commercial reputation: she waited silently through the\nnight, mingling her prayers and terrors. Was Cesar dead? Had he left\nParis on the scent of some last hope? The next morning she behaved as\nthough she knew the reasons for his absence; but at five o'clock in the\nafternoon when Cesar had not returned, she sent for her uncle and\nbegged him to go at once to the Morgue. During the whole of that day the\ncourageous creature sat behind her counter, her daughter embroidering\nbeside her. When Pillerault returned, Cesar was with him; on his way\nback the old man had met him in the Palais-Royal, hesitating before the\nentrance to a gambling-house.\n\nThis was the 14th. At dinner Cesar could not eat. His stomach, violently\ncontracted, rejected food. The evening hours were terrible. The shaken\nman went through, for the hundredth time, one of those frightful\nalternations of hope and despair which, by forcing the soul to run up\nthe scale of joyous emotion and then precipitating it to the last\ndepths of agony, exhaust the vital strength of feeble beings. Derville,\nBirotteau's advocate, rushed into the handsome salon where Madame Cesar\nwas using all her persuasion to retain her husband, who wished to sleep\non the fifth floor,--\"that I may not see,\" he said, \"these monuments of\nmy folly.\"\n\n\"The suit is won!\" cried Derville.\n\nAt these words Cesar's drawn face relaxed; but his joy alarmed Derville\nand Pillerault. The women left the room to go and weep by themselves in\nCesarine's chamber.\n\n\"Now I can get a loan!\" cried Birotteau.\n\n\"It would be imprudent,\" said Derville; \"they have appealed; the court\nmight reverse the judgment; but in a month it would be safe.\"\n\n\"A month!\"\n\nCesar fell into a sort of slumber, from which no one tried to rouse\nhim,--a species of catalepsy, in which the body lived and suffered while\nthe functions of the mind were in abeyance. This respite, bestowed by\nchance, was looked upon by Constance, Cesarine, Pillerault, and Derville\nas a blessing from God. And they judged rightly: Cesar was thus enabled\nto bear the harrowing emotions of that night. He was sitting in a corner\nof the sofa near the fire; his wife was in the other corner watching him\nattentively, with a soft smile upon her lips,--the smile which proves\nthat women are nearer than men to angelic nature, in that they know how\nto mingle an infinite tenderness with an all-embracing compassion; a\nsecret belonging only to angels seen in dreams providentially strewn at\nlong intervals through the history of human life. Cesarine, sitting on\na little stool at her mother's feet, touched her father's hand lightly\nwith her hair from time to time, as she gave him a caress into which\nshe strove to put the thoughts which, in such crises, the voice seems to\nrender intrusive.\n\nSeated in his arm-chair, like the Chancelier de l'Hopital on the\nperistyle of the Chamber of Deputies, Pillerault--a philosopher prepared\nfor all events, and showing upon his countenance the wisdom of an\nEgyptian sphinx--was talking to Derville and his niece in a suppressed\nvoice. Constance thought it best to consult the lawyer, whose discretion\nwas beyond a doubt. With the balance-sheet written in her head, she\nexplained the whole situation in low tones. After an hour's conference,\nheld in presence of the stupefied Cesar, Derville shook his head and\nlooked at Pillerault.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, with the horrible coolness of his profession, \"you\nmust give in your schedule and make an assignment. Even supposing that\nby some contrivance you could meet the payments for to-morrow, you would\nhave to pay down at least three hundred thousand francs before you could\nborrow on those lands. Your liabilities are five hundred thousand. To\nmeet them you have assets that are very promising, very productive,\nbut not convertible at present; you must fail within a given time. My\nopinion is that it is better to jump out of the window than to roll\ndownstairs.\"\n\n\"That is my advice, too, dear child,\" said Pillerault.\n\nDerville left, and Madame Cesar and Pillerault went with him to the\ndoor.\n\n\"Poor father!\" said Cesarine, who rose softly to lay a kiss on Cesar's\nhead. \"Then Anselme could do nothing?\" she added, as her mother and\nPillerault returned.\n\n\"UNGRATEFUL!\" cried Cesar, struck by the name of Anselme in the only\nliving part of his memory,--as the note of a piano lifts the hammer\nwhich strikes its corresponding string.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nFrom the moment when that word \"Ungrateful\" was flung at him like an\nanathema, little Popinot had not had an hour's sleep nor an instant's\npeace of mind. The unhappy lad cursed his uncle, and finally went to\nsee him. To get the better of that experienced judicial wisdom he poured\nforth the eloquence of love, hoping it might seduce a being from whose\nmind human speech slips like water from a duck's back,--a judge!\n\n\"From a commercial point of view,\" he said, \"custom does allow the\nmanaging-partner to advance a certain sum to the sleeping-partner on the\nprofits of the business, and we are certain to make profits. After close\nexamination of my affairs I do feel strong enough to pay forty thousand\nfrancs in three months. The known integrity of Monsieur Cesar is a\nguarantee that he will use that forty thousand to pay off his debts.\nThus the creditors, if there should come a failure, can lay no blame on\nus. Besides, uncle, I would rather lose forty thousand francs than lose\nCesarine. At this very moment while I am speaking, she has doubtless\nbeen told of my refusal, and will cease to esteem me. I vowed my blood\nto my benefactor! I am like a young sailor who ought to sink with his\ncaptain, or a soldier who should die with his general.\"\n\n\"Good heart and bad merchant, you will never lose my esteem,\" said the\njudge, pressing the hand of his nephew. \"I have thought a great deal of\nthis,\" he added. \"I know you love Cesarine devotedly, and I think you\ncan satisfy the claims of love and the claims of commerce.\"\n\n\"Ah! my uncle, if you have found a way my honor is saved!\"\n\n\"Advance Birotteau fifty thousand on his share in your oil, which has\nnow become a species of property, reserving to yourself the right of\nbuying it back. I will draw up the deed.\"\n\nAnselme embraced his uncle and rushed home, made notes to the amount\nof fifty thousand francs, and ran from the Rue des Cinq-Diamants to the\nPlace Vendome, so that just as Cesarine, her mother, and Pillerault were\ngazing at Cesar, amazed at the sepulchural tone in which he had\nuttered the word \"Ungrateful!\" the door of the salon opened and Popinot\nappeared.\n\n\"My dear and beloved master!\" he cried, wiping the perspiration from his\nforehead, \"here is what you asked of me!\" He held out the notes. \"Yes, I\nhave carefully examined my situation; you need have no fear, I shall be\nable to pay them. Save--save your honor!\"\n\n\"I was sure of him!\" cried Cesarine, seizing Popinot's hand, and\npressing it with convulsive force.\n\nMadame Cesar embraced him; Birotteau rose up like the righteous at the\nsound of the last trumpet, and issued, as it were, from the tomb. Then\nhe stretched out a frenzied hand to seize the fifty stamped papers.\n\n\"Stop!\" said the terrible uncle, Pillerault, snatching the papers from\nPopinot, \"one moment!\"\n\nThe four individuals present,--Cesar, his wife, Cesarine, and\nPopinot,--bewildered by the action of the old man and by the tone of\nhis voice, saw him tear the papers and fling them in the fire, without\nattempting to interfere.\n\n\"Uncle!\"\n\n\"Uncle!\"\n\n\"Uncle!\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\nFour voices and but one heart; a startling unanimity! Uncle Pillerault\npassed his arm round Popinot's neck, held him to his breast, and kissed\nhim.\n\n\"You are worthy of the love of those who have hearts,\" he said. \"If you\nloved a daughter of mine, had she a million and you had nothing but that\n[pointing to the black ashes of the notes], you should marry her in a\nfortnight, if she loved you. Your master,\" he said, pointing to Cesar,\n\"is beside himself. My nephew,\" resumed Pillerault, gravely, addressing\nthe poor man,--\"my nephew, away with illusions! We must do business with\nfrancs, not feelings. All this is noble, but useless. I spent two hours\nat the Bourse this afternoon. You have not one farthing's credit; every\none is talking of your disaster, of your attempts to renew, of your\nappeals to various bankers, of their refusals, of your follies,--going\nup six flights of stairs to beg a gossiping landlord, who chatters like\na magpie, to renew a note of twelve hundred francs!--your ball, given to\nconceal your embarrassments. They have gone so far as to say you had no\nproperty in Roguin's hands; according to your enemies, Roguin is only\na blind. A friend of mine, whom I sent about to learn what is going on,\nconfirms what I tell you. Every one foresees that Popinot will issue\nnotes, and believes that you set him up in business expressly as a last\nresource. In short, every calumny or slander which a man brings upon\nhimself when he tries to mount a rung of the social ladder, is going the\nrounds among business men to-day. You might hawk about those notes of\nPopinot in vain; you would meet humiliating refusals; no one would take\nthem; no one could be sure how many such notes you are issuing; every\none expects you to sacrifice the poor lad to your own safety. You would\ndestroy to no purpose the credit of the house of Popinot. Do you\nknow how much the boldest money-lender would give you for those fifty\nthousand francs? Twenty thousand at the most; twenty thousand, do you\nhear me? There are crises in business when we must stand up three days\nbefore the world without eating, as if we had indigestion, and on the\nfourth day we may be admitted to the larder of credit. You cannot live\nthrough those three days; and the whole matter lies there. My poor\nnephew, take courage! file your schedule, make an assignment. Here is\nPopinot, here am I; we will go to work as soon as the clerks have gone\nto bed, and spare you the agony of it.\"\n\n\"My uncle!\" said Cesar, clasping his hands.\n\n\"Cesar, would you choose a shameful failure, in which there are no\nassets? Your share in the house of Popinot is all that saves your\nhonor.\"\n\nCesar, awakened by this last and fatal stream of light, saw at length\nthe frightful truth in its full extent; he fell back upon the sofa, from\nthence to his knees, and his mind seemed to wander; he became like a\nlittle child. His wife thought he was dying. She knelt down to raise\nhim, but joined her voice to his when she saw him clasp his hands and\nlift his eyes, and recite, with resigned contrition, in the hearing of\nhis uncle, his daughter, and Popinot, the sublime catholic prayer:--\n\n\"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come;\nThy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; GIVE US THIS DAY OUR\nDAILY BREAD; and forgive us our offences, as we forgive those who have\noffended against us. So be it!\"\n\nTears came into the eyes of the stoic Pillerault; Cesarine, overcome and\nweeping, leaned her head upon Popinot's shoulder, as he stood pale and\nrigid as a statue.\n\n\"Let us go below,\" said the old merchant, taking the arm of the young\nman.\n\nIt was half-past eleven when they left Cesar to the care of his wife\nand daughter. Just at that moment Celestin, the head-clerk, to whom the\nmanagement of the house had been left during this secret tumult, came up\nto the appartement and entered the salon. Hearing his step, Cesarine ran\nto meet him, that he might not see the prostration of his master.\n\n\"Among the letters this evening there was one from Tours, which was\nmisdirected and therefore delayed. I thought it might be from monsieur's\nbrother, so I did not open it.\"\n\n\"Father!\" cried Cesarine; \"a letter from my uncle at Tours!\"\n\n\"Ah, I am saved!\" cried Cesar. \"My brother! oh, my brother!\" He kissed\nthe letter, as he broke the seal, and read it aloud to his wife and\ndaughter in a trembling voice:--\n\n\n  Answer of Francois to Cesar Birotteau.\n                                             Tours, 10th.\n\n  My beloved Brother,--Your letter gave me the deepest pain. As soon\n  as I had read it, I went at once and offered to God the holy\n  sacrifice of the Mass, imploring Him by the blood which His Son,\n  our divine Redeemer, shed for us, to look with mercy upon your\n  afflictions. At the moment when I offered the prayer _Pro meo\n  fratre Caesare_, my eyes were filled with tears as I thought of\n  you,--from whom, unfortunately, I am separated in these days when\n  you must sorely need the support of fraternal friendship. I have\n  thought that the worthy and venerable Monsieur Pillerault would\n  doubtless replace me. My dear Cesar, never forget, in the midst of\n  your troubles, that this life is a scene of trial, and is passing\n  away; that one day we shall be rewarded for having suffered for\n  the holy name of God, for His holy Church, for having followed the\n  teachings of His Gospel and practised virtue. If it were\n  otherwise, this world would have no meaning. I repeat to you these\n  maxims, though I know how good and pious you are, because it may\n  happen that those who, like you, are flung into the storms of life\n  upon the perilous waves of human interests might be tempted to\n  utter blasphemies in the midst of their adversity,--carried away\n  as they are by anguish. Curse neither the men who injure you nor\n  the God who mingles, at His will, your joy with bitterness. Look\n  not on life, but lift your eyes to heaven; there is comfort for\n  the weak, there are riches for the poor, there are terrors for\n  the--\n\n\"But, Birotteau,\" said his wife, \"skip all that, and see what he sends\nus.\"\n\n\"We will read it over and over hereafter,\" said Cesar, wiping his eyes\nand turning over the page,--letting fall, as he did so, a Treasury note.\n\"I was sure of him, poor brother!\" said Birotteau, picking up the note\nand continuing to read, in a voice broken by tears.\n\n  I went to Madame de Listomere, and without telling her the reason\n  of my request I asked her to lend me all she could dispose of, so\n  as to swell the amount of my savings. Her generosity has enabled\n  me to make up a thousand francs; which I send herewith, in a note\n  of the Receiver-General of Tours on the Treasury.\n\n\"A fine sum!\" said Constance, looking at Cesarine.\n\n  By retrenching a few superfluities in my life, I can return the\n  four hundred francs Madame de Listomere has lent me in three\n  years; so do not make yourself uneasy about them, my dear Cesar. I\n  send you all I have in the world; hoping that this sum may help\n  you to a happy conclusion of your financial difficulties, which\n  doubtless are only momentary. I well know your delicacy, and I\n  wish to forestall your objections. Do not dream of paying me any\n  interest for this money, nor of paying it back at all in the day\n  of prosperity which ere long will dawn for you if God deigns to\n  hear the prayers I offer to Him daily. After I received your last\n  letter, two years ago, I thought you so rich that I felt at\n  liberty to spend my savings upon the poor; but now, all that I\n  have is yours. When you have overcome this little commercial\n  difficulty, keep the sum I now send for my niece Cesarine; so that\n  when she marries she may buy some trifle to remind her of her old\n  uncle, who daily lifts his hands to heaven to implore the blessing\n  of God upon her and all who are dear to her. And also, my dear\n  Cesar, recollect I am a poor priest who dwells, by the grace of\n  God, like the larks in the meadow, in quiet places, trying to obey\n  the commandment of our divine Saviour, and who consequently needs\n  but little money. Therefore, do not have the least scruple in the\n  trying circumstances in which you find yourself; and think of me\n  as one who loves you tenderly.\n\n  Our excellent Abbe Chapeloud, to whom I have not revealed your\n  situation, desires me to convey his friendly regards to every\n  member of your family, and his wishes for the continuance of your\n  prosperity. Adieu, dear and well-beloved brother; I pray that at\n  this painful juncture God will be pleased to preserve your health,\n  and also that of your wife and daughter. I wish you, one and all,\n  patience and courage under your afflictions.\n\n            Francois Birotteau,\n            Priest, Vicar of the Cathedral and Parochial Church\n                    of Saint-Gatien de Tours.\n\n\n\"A thousand francs!\" cried Madame Birotteau.\n\n\"Put them away,\" said Cesar gravely; \"they are all he had. Besides, they\nbelong to our daughter, and will enable us to live; so that we need ask\nnothing of our creditors.\"\n\n\"They will think you are abstracting large sums.\"\n\n\"Then I will show them the letter.\"\n\n\"They will say that it is a fraud.\"\n\n\"My God! my God!\" cried Birotteau. \"I once thought thus of poor, unhappy\npeople who were doubtless as I am now.\"\n\nTerribly anxious about Cesar's state, mother and daughter sat plying\ntheir needles by his side, in profound silence. At two in the morning\nPopinot gently opened the door of the salon and made a sign to Madame\nCesar to come down. On seeing his niece Pillerault took off his\nspectacles.\n\n\"My child, there is hope,\" he said; \"all is not lost. But your husband\ncould not bear the uncertainty of the negotiations which Anselme and I\nare about to undertake. Don't leave your shop to-morrow, and take the\naddresses of all the bills; we have till four o'clock in the afternoon\nof the 15th. Here is my plan: Neither Ragon nor I am to be considered.\nSuppose that your hundred thousand francs deposited with Roguin had been\nremitted to the purchasers, you would not have them then any more than\nyou have them now. The hundred and forty thousand francs for which notes\nwere given to Claparon, and which must be paid in any state of the case,\nare what you have to meet. Therefore it is not Roguin's bankruptcy which\nas ruined you. I find, to meet your obligations, forty thousand francs\nwhich you can, sooner or later, borrow on your property in the Faubourg\ndu Temple, and sixty thousand for your share in the house of Popinot.\nThus you can make a struggle, for later you may borrow on the lands\nabout the Madeleine. If your chief creditor agrees to help you, I shall\nnot consider my interests; I shall sell out my Funds and live on dry\nbread; Popinot will get along between life and death, and as for you,\nyou will be at the mercy of the smallest commercial mischance; but\nCephalic Oil will undoubtedly make great returns. Popinot and I have\nconsulted together; we will stand by you in this struggle. Ah! I shall\neat my dry bread gaily if I see daylight breaking on the horizon. But\neverything depends on Gigonnet, who holds the notes, and the associates\nof Claparon. Popinot and I are going to see Gigonnet between seven\nand eight o'clock in the morning, and then we shall know what their\nintentions are.\"\n\nConstance, wholly overcome, threw herself into her uncle's arms,\nvoiceless except through tears and sobs.\n\nNeither Popinot nor Pillerault knew or could know that Bidault, called\nGigonnet, and Claparon were du Tillet under two shapes; and that du\nTillet was resolved to read in the \"Journal des Petites Affiches\" this\nterrible article:--\n\n  \"Judgment of the Court of Commerce, which declares the Sieur Cesar\n  Birotteau, merchant-perfumer, living in Paris, Rue Saint-Honore,\n  no. 397, insolvent, and appoints the preliminary examination on\n  the 17th of January, 1819. Commissioner, Monsieur\n  Gobenheim-Keller. Agent, Monsieur Molineux.\"\n\nAnselme and Pillerault examined Cesar's affairs until daylight. At eight\no'clock in the morning the two brave friends,--one an old soldier,\nthe other a young recruit, who had never known, except by hearsay, the\nterrible anguish of those who commonly went up the staircase of Bidault\ncalled Gigonnet,--wended their way, without a word to each other,\ntowards the Rue Grenetat. Both were suffering; from time to time\nPillerault passed his hand across his brow.\n\nThe Rue Grenetat is a street where all the houses, crowded with trades\nof every kind, have a repulsive aspect. The buildings are horrible.\nThe vile uncleanliness of manufactories is their leading feature. Old\nGigonnet lived on the third floor of a house whose window-sashes,\nwith small and very dirty panes, swung by the middle, on pivots. The\nstaircase opened directly upon the street. The porter's lodge was on the\n_entresol_, in a space which was lighted only from the staircase. All\nthe lodgers, with the exception of Gigonnet, worked at trades. Workmen\nwere continually coming and going. The stairs were caked with a layer\nof mud, hard or soft according to the state of the atmosphere, and were\ncovered with filth. Each landing of this noisome stairway bore the\nnames of the occupants in gilt letters on a metal plate, painted red and\nvarnished, to which were attached specimens of their craft. As a rule,\nthe doors stood open and gave to view queer combinations of the domestic\nhousehold and the manufacturing operations. Strange cries and grunts\nissued therefrom, with songs and whistles and hisses that recalled the\nhour of four o'clock in the Jardin des Plantes. On the first floor,\nin an evil-smelling lair, the handsomest braces to be found in the\n_article-Paris_ were made. On the second floor, the elegant boxes which\nadorn the shop-windows of the boulevards and the Palais-Royal at the\nbeginning of the new year were manufactured, in the midst of the vilest\nfilth. Gigonnet eventually died, worth eighteen hundred thousand francs,\non a third floor of this house, from which no consideration could\nmove him; though his niece, Madame Saillard, offered to give him an\nappartement in a hotel in the Place Royalle.\n\n\"Courage!\" said Pillerault, as he pulled the deer's hoof hanging from\nthe bell-rope of Gigonnet's clean gray door.\n\nGigonnet opened the door himself. Cesar's two supporters, entering the\nprecincts of bankruptcy, crossed the first room, which was clean and\nchilly and without curtains to its windows. All three sat down in the\ninner room where the money-lender lived, before a hearth full of ashes,\nin the midst of which the wood was successfully defending itself against\nthe fire. Popinot's courage froze at sight of the usurer's green boxes\nand the monastic austerity of the room, whose atmosphere was like that\nof a cellar. He looked with a wondering eye at the miserable blueish\npaper sprinkled with tricolor flowers, which had been on the walls\nfor twenty-five years; and then his anxious glance fell upon the\nchimney-piece, ornamented with a clock shaped like a lyre, and two oval\nvases in Sevres blue richly mounted in copper-gilt. This relic, picked\nup by Gigonnet after the pillage of Versailles, where the populace broke\nnearly everything, came from the queen's boudoir; but these rare vases\nwere flanked by two candelabra of abject shape made of wrought-iron, and\nthe barbarous contrast recalled the circumstances under which the vases\nhad been acquired.\n\n\"I know that you have not come on your own account,\" said Gigonnet, \"but\non behalf of the great Birotteau. Well, what is it, my friends?\"\n\n\"We can tell you nothing that you do not already know; so I will be\nbrief,\" said Pillerault. \"You have notes to the order of Claparon?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you exchange the first fifty thousand of those notes against the\nnotes of Monsieur Popinot, here present,--less the discount, of course?\"\n\nGigonnet took off the terrible green cap which seemed to have been born\non him, pointed to his skull, denuded of hair and of the color of fresh\nbutter, made his usual Voltairean grimace, and said: \"You wish to pay me\nin hair-oil; have I any use for it?\"\n\n\"If you choose to jest, there is nothing to be done but to beat a\nretreat,\" said Pillerault.\n\n\"You speak like the wise man that you are,\" answered Gigonnet, with a\nflattering smile.\n\n\"Well, suppose I endorse Monsieur Popinot's notes?\" said Pillerault,\nplaying his last card.\n\n\"You are gold by the ingot, Monsieur Pillerault; but I don't want bars\nof gold, I want my money.\"\n\nPillerault and Popinot bowed and went away. Going down the stairs,\nPopinot's knees shook under him.\n\n\"Is that a man?\" he said to Pillerault.\n\n\"They say so,\" replied the other. \"My boy, always bear in mind this\nshort interview. Anselme, you have just seen the banking-business\nunmasked, without its cloak of courtesy. Unexpected events are the screw\nof the press, we are the grapes, the bankers are the casks. That land\nspeculation is no doubt a good one; Gigonnet, or some one behind him,\nmeans to strangle Cesar and step into his skin. It is all over; there's\nno remedy. But such is the Bank: be warned; never have recourse to it!\"\n\nAfter this horrible morning, during which Madame Birotteau for the first\ntime sent away those who came for their money, taking their addresses,\nthe courageous woman, happy in the thought that she was thus sparing her\nhusband from distress, saw Popinot and Pillerault, for whom she waited\nwith ever-growing anxiety, return at eleven o'clock, and read her\nsentence in their faces. The assignment was inevitable.\n\n\"He will die of grief,\" said the poor woman.\n\n\"I could almost wish he might,\" said Pillerault, solemnly; \"but he is so\nreligious that, as things are now, his director, the Abbe Loraux, alone\ncan save him.\"\n\nPillerault, Popinot, and Constance waited while a clerk was sent to\nbring the Abbe Loraux, before they carried up to Cesar the schedule\nwhich Celestin had prepared, and asked him to affix his signature. The\nclerks were in despair, for they loved their master. At four o'clock\nthe good priest came; Constance explained the misfortune that had fallen\nupon them, and the abbe went upstairs as a soldier mounts the breach.\n\n\"I know why you have come!\" cried Birotteau.\n\n\"My son,\" said the priest, \"your feelings of resignation to the Divine\nwill have long been known to me; it now remains to apply them. Keep\nyour eyes upon the cross; never cease to behold it, and think upon the\nhumiliations heaped upon the Saviour of men. Meditate upon the agonies\nof his passion, and you will be able to bear the mortification which God\nhas laid upon you--\"\n\n\"My brother, the abbe, has already prepared me,\" said Cesar, showing the\nletter, which he had re-read and now held out to his confessor.\n\n\"You have a good brother,\" said Monsieur Loraux, \"a virtuous and gentle\nwife, a tender daughter, two good friends,--your uncle and our dear\nAnselme,--two indulgent creditors, the Ragons: all these kind hearts\nwill pour balm upon your wounds daily, and will help you to bear your\ncross. Promise me to have the firmness of a martyr, and to face the blow\nwithout faltering.\"\n\nThe abbe coughed, to give notice to Pillerault who was waiting in the\nsalon.\n\n\"My resignation is unbounded,\" said Cesar, calmly. \"Dishonor has come; I\nmust now think only of reparation.\"\n\nThe firm voice of the poor man and his whole manner surprised Cesarine\nand the priest. Yet nothing could be more natural. All men can better\nbear a known and definite misfortune than the cruel uncertainties of\na fate which, from one moment to another, brings excessive hope or\ncrushing sorrow.\n\n\"I have dreamed a dream for twenty-two years; to-day I awake with my\ncudgel in my hand,\" said Cesar, his mind turning back to the Tourangian\npeasant days.\n\nPillerault pressed his nephew in his arms as he heard the words.\nBirotteau saw that his wife, Anselme, and Celestin were present. The\npapers which the head-clerk held in his hand were significant. Cesar\ncalmly contemplated the little group where every eye was sad but loving.\n\n\"Stay!\" he said, unfastening his cross, which he held out to the Abbe\nLoraux; \"give it back to me on the day when I can wear it without shame.\nCelestin,\" he added, \"write my resignation as deputy-mayor,--Monsieur\nl'abbe will dictate the letter to you; date it the 14th, and send it at\nonce to Monsieur de la Billardiere by Raguet.\"\n\nCelestin and the abbe went down stairs. For a quarter of an hour silence\nreigned unbroken in Cesar's study. Such strength of mind surprised\nthe family. Celestin and the abbe came back, and Cesar signed his\nresignation. When his uncle Pillerault presented the schedule and the\npapers of his assignment, the poor man could not repress a horrible\nnervous shudder.\n\n\"My God, have pity upon me!\" he said, signing the dreadful paper, and\nholding it out to Celestin.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Anselme Popinot, over whose dejected brow a luminous\nlight flashed suddenly, \"madame, do me the honor to grant me the hand of\nMademoiselle Cesarine.\"\n\nAt these words tears came into the eyes of all present except Cesar; he\nrose, took Anselme by the hand and said, in a hollow voice, \"My son, you\nshall never marry the daughter of a bankrupt.\"\n\nAnselme looked fixedly at Birotteau and said: \"Monsieur, will you pledge\nyourself, here, in presence of your whole family, to consent to our\nmarriage, if mademoiselle will accept me as her husband, on the day when\nyou have retrieved your failure?\"\n\nThere was an instant's silence, during which all present were affected\nby the emotions painted on the worn face of the poor man.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, at last.\n\nAnselme made a gesture of unspeakable joy, as he took the hand which\nCesarine held out to him, and kissed it.\n\n\"You consent, then?\" he said to her.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\n\n\"Now that I am one of the family, I have the right to concern myself in\nits affairs,\" he said, with a strange, excited expression of face.\n\nHe left the room precipitately, that he might not show a joy which\ncontrasted too cruelly with the sorrow of his master. Anselme was not\nactually happy at the failure, but love is such an egoist! Even Cesarine\nfelt within her heart an emotion that counteracted her bitter grief.\n\n\"Now that we have got so far,\" whispered Pillerault to Constance, \"shall\nwe strike the last blow?\"\n\nMadame Birotteau let a sign of grief rather than of acquiescence escape\nher.\n\n\"My nephew,\" said Pillerault, addressing Cesar, \"what do you intend to\ndo?\"\n\n\"To carry on my business.\"\n\n\"That would not be my judgment,\" said Pillerault. \"Take my advice, wind\nup everything, make over your whole assets to your creditors, and keep\nout of business. I have often imagined how it would be if I were in a\nsituation such as yours--Ah, one has to foresee everything in business!\na merchant who does not think of failure is like a general who counts on\nnever being defeated; he is only half a merchant. I, in your position,\nwould never have continued in business. What! be forced to blush\nbefore the men I had injured, to bear their suspicious looks and tacit\nreproaches? I can conceive of the guillotine--a moment, and all is over.\nBut to have the head replaced, and daily cut off anew,--that is agony I\ncould not have borne. Many men take up their business as if nothing\nhad happened: so much the better for them; they are stronger than\nClaude-Joseph Pillerault. If you pay in cash, and you are obliged to\ndo so, they say that you have kept back part of your assets; if you are\nwithout a penny, it is useless to attempt to recover yourself. No, give\nup your property, sell your business, and find something else to do.\"\n\n\"What could I find?\" said Cesar.\n\n\"Well,\" said Pillerault, \"look for a situation. You have influential\nfriends,--the Duc and the Duchesse de Lenoncourt, Madame de Mortsauf,\nMonsieur de Vandenesse. Write to them, go and see them; they might get\nyou a situation in the royal household which would give you a thousand\ncrowns or so; your wife could earn as much more, and perhaps your\ndaughter also. The situation is not hopeless. You three might earn\nnearly ten thousand francs a year. In ten years you can pay off a\nhundred thousand francs, for you shall not use a penny of what you earn;\nyour two women will have fifteen hundred francs a year from me for their\nexpenses, and, as for you,--we will see about that.\"\n\nConstance and Cesar laid these wise words to heart. Pillerault left\nthem to go to the Bourse, which in those days was held in a provisional\nwooden building of a circular shape, and was entered from the Rue\nFaydeau. The failure, already known, of a man lately noted and envied,\nexcited general comment in the upper commercial circles, which at that\nperiod were all \"constitutionnel.\" The gentry of the Opposition claimed\na monopoly of patriotism. Royalists might love the king, but to love\nyour country was the exclusive privilege of the Left; the people\nbelonged to it. The downfall of the protege of the palace, of a\nministeralist, an incorrigible royalist who on the 13th Vendemiaire had\ninsulted the cause of liberty by fighting against the glorious French\nRevolution,--such a downfall excited the applause and tittle-tattle of\nthe Bourse. Pillerault wished to learn and study the state of public\nopinion. He found in one of the most animated groups du Tillet,\nGobenheim-Keller, Nucingen, old Guillaume, and his son-in-law Joseph\nLebas, Claparon, Gigonnet, Mongenod, Camusot, Gobseck, Adolphe Keller,\nPalma, Chiffreville, Matifat, Grindot, and Lourdois.\n\n\"What caution one needs to have!\" said Gobenheim to du Tillet. \"It was\na mere chance that one of my brothers-in-law did not give Birotteau a\ncredit.\"\n\n\"I am in for ten thousand francs,\" said du Tillet; \"he asked me for them\ntwo weeks ago, and I let him have them on his own note without security.\nBut he formerly did me some service, and I am willing to lose the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Your nephew has done like all the rest,\" said Lourdois to\nPillerault,--\"given balls and parties! That a scoundrel should try to\nthrow dust in people's eyes, I can understand; but it is amazing that\na man who passed for as honest as the day should play those worn-out,\nknavish tricks which we are always finding out and condemning.\"\n\n\"Don't trust people unless they live in hovels like Claparon,\" said\nGigonnet.\n\n\"Hey! mein freint,\" said the fat Nucingen to du Tillet, \"you haf joust\nmissed blaying me a bretty drick in zenting Pirodot to me. I don't\nknow,\" he added, addressing Gobenheim the manufacturer, \"vy he tid not\nask me for fifdy tousand francs. I should haf gif dem to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Monsieur le baron,\" said Joseph Lebas, \"you knew very well that\nthe Bank had refused his paper; you made them reject it in the committee\non discounts. The affair of this unfortunate man, for whom I still feel\nthe highest esteem, presents certain peculiar circumstances.\"\n\nPillerault pressed the hand of Joseph Lebas.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mongenod, \"it seems impossible to believe what has happened,\nunless we believe that concealed behind Gigonnet there are certain\nbankers who want to strangle the speculation in the lands about the\nMadeleine.\"\n\n\"What has happened is what happens always to those who go out of their\nproper business,\" said Claparon, hastily interrupting Mongenod. \"If he\nhad set up his own Cephalic Oil instead of running up the price of all\nthe land in Paris by pouncing upon it, he might have lost his hundred\nthousand francs with Roguin, but he wouldn't have failed. He will go on\nnow under the name of Popinot.\"\n\n\"Keep a watch on Popinot,\" said Gigonnet.\n\nRoguin, in the parlance of such worthy merchants, was now the\n\"unfortunate Roguin.\" Cesar had become \"that wretched Birotteau.\"\nThe one seemed to them excused by his great passion; the other they\nconsidered all the more guilty for his harmless pretensions.\n\nGigonnet, after leaving the Bourse, went round by the Rue\nPerrin-Gasselin on his way home, in search of Madame Madou, the vendor\nof dried fruits.\n\n\"Well, old woman,\" he said, with his coarse good-humor, \"how goes the\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"So-so,\" said Madame Madou, respectfully, offering her only armchair to\nthe usurer, with a show of attention she had never bestowed on her \"dear\ndefunct.\"\n\nMother Madou, who would have floored a recalcitrant or too-familiar\nwagoner and gone fearlessly to the assault of the Tuileries on the 10th\nof October, who jeered her best customers and was capable of speaking up\nto the king in the name of her associate market-women,--Angelique Madou\nreceived Gigonnet with abject respect. Without strength in his presence,\nshe shuddered under his rasping glance. The lower classes will long\ntremble at sight of the executioner, and Gigonnet was the executioner of\npetty commerce. In the markets no power on earth is so respected as that\nof the man who controls the flow of money; all other human institutions\nare as nothing beside him. Justice herself takes the form of a\ncommissioner, a familiar personage in the eyes of the market; but usury\nseated behind its green boxes,--usury, entreated with fear tugging at\nthe heart-strings, dries up all jesting, parches the throat, lowers the\nproudest look, and makes the commonest market women respectful.\n\n\"Do you want anything of me?\" she said.\n\n\"A trifle, a mere nothing. Hold yourself ready to make good those notes\nof Birotteau; the man has failed, and claims must be put in at once. I\nwill send you the account to-morrow morning.\"\n\nMadame Madou's eyes contracted like those of a cat for a second, and\nthen shot out flames.\n\n\"Ah, the villain! Ah, the scoundrel! He came and told me himself he was\na deputy-mayor,--a trumped-up story! Reprobate! is that what he calls\nbusiness? There is no honor among mayors; the government deceives us.\nStop! I'll go and make him pay me; I will--\"\n\n\"Hey! at such times everybody looks out for himself, my dear!\" said\nGigonnet, lifting his leg with the quaint little action of a cat fearing\nto cross a wet place,--a habit to which he owed his nickname. \"There are\nsome very big wigs in the matter who mean to get themselves out of the\nscrape.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'll pull my nuts out of the fire, too! Marie-Jeanne, bring my\nclogs and my rabbit-skin cloak; and quick, too, or I'll warm you up with\na box on the ear.\"\n\n\"There'll be warm work down there!\" thought Gigonnet, rubbing his hands\nas he walked away. \"Du Tillet will be satisfied; it will make a fine\nscandal all through the quarter. I don't know what that poor devil of\na perfumer has done to him; for my part I pity the fellow as I do a dog\nwith a broken leg. He isn't a man, he has got no force.\"\n\nMadame Madou bore down, like an insurrectionary wave from the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine, upon the shop-door of the hapless Birotteau, which she\nopened with excessive violence, for her walk had increased her fury.\n\n\"Heap of vermin! I want my money; I will have my money! You shall give\nme my money, or I carry off your scent-bags, and that satin trumpery,\nand the fans, and everything you've got here, for my two thousand\nfrancs. Who ever heard of mayors robbing the people? If you don't pay me\nI'll send you to the galleys; I'll go to the police,--justice shall be\ndone! I won't leave this place till I've got my money.\"\n\nShe made a gesture as if to break the glass before the shelves on which\nthe valuables were placed.\n\n\"Mother Madou takes a drop too much,\" whispered Celestin to his\nneighbor.\n\nThe virago overheard him,--for in paroxysms of passion the organs\nare either paralyzed or trebly acute,--and she forthwith applied to\nCelestin's ear the most vigorous blow that ever resounded in a Parisian\nperfumery.\n\n\"Learn to respect women, my angel,\" she said, \"and don't smirch the\nnames of the people you rob.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Madame Birotteau, entering from the back-shop, where she\nhappened to be with her husband,--whom Pillerault was persuading to\ngo with him, while Cesar, to obey the law, was humbly expressing his\nwillingness to go to prison,--\"madame, for heaven's sake do not raise a\nmob, and bring a crowd upon us!\"\n\n\"Hey! let them come,\" said the woman; \"I'll tell them a tale that will\nmake you laugh the wrong side of your mouth. Yes, my nuts and my francs,\npicked up by the sweat of my brow, helped you to give balls. There you\nare, dressed like the queen of France in woollen which you sheared\noff the backs of poor sheep such as me! Good God! it would burn my\nshoulders, that it would, to wear stolen goods! I've got nothing but\nrabbit-skin to cover my carcass, but it is mine! Brigands, thieves, my\nmoney or--\"\n\nShe darted at a pretty inlaid box containing toilet articles.\n\n\"Put that down, madame!\" said Cesar, coming forward, \"nothing here\nis mine; everything belongs to my creditors. I own nothing but my own\nperson; if you wish to seize that and put me in prison, I give you my\nword of honor\"--the tears fell from his eyes--\"that I will wait here\ntill you have me arrested.\"\n\nThe tone and gesture were so completely in keeping with his words that\nMadame Madou's anger subsided.\n\n\"My property has been carried off by a notary; I am innocent of the\ndisasters I cause,\" continued Cesar, \"but you shall be paid in course of\ntime if I have to die in the effort, and work like a galley-slave as a\nporter in the markets.\"\n\n\"Come, you are a good man,\" said the market-woman. \"Excuse my words,\nmadame; but I may as well go and drown myself, for Gigonnet will hound\nme down. I can't get any money for ten months to redeem those damned\nnotes of yours which I gave him.\"\n\n\"Come and see me to-morrow morning,\" said Pillerault, showing himself.\n\"I will get you the money from one of my friends, at five per cent.\"\n\n\"Hey! if it isn't the worthy Pere Pillerault! Why, to be sure, he's your\nuncle,\" she said to Constance. \"Well, you are all honest people, and I\nsha'n't lose my money, shall I? To-morrow morning, then, old fellow!\"\nshe said to the retired iron-monger.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nCesar was determined to live on amid the wreck of his fortunes at \"The\nQueen of Roses,\" insisting that he would see his creditors and explain\nhis affairs to them himself. Despite Madame Birotteau's earnest\nentreaties, Pillerault seemed to approve of Cesar's decision and took\nhim back to his own room. The wily old man then went to Monsieur Haudry,\nexplained the case, and obtained from him a prescription for a sleeping\ndraught, which he took to be made up, and then returned to spend the\nevening with the family. Aided by Cesarine he induced her father to\ndrink with them. The narcotic soon put Cesar to sleep, and when he\nwoke up, fourteen hours later, he was in Pillerault's bedroom, Rue des\nBourdonnais, fairly imprisoned by the old man, who was sleeping himself\non a cot-bed in the salon.\n\nWhen Constance heard the coach containing Pillerault and Cesar roll away\nfrom the door, her courage deserted her. Our powers are often stimulated\nby the necessity of upholding some being feebler than ourselves. The\npoor woman wept to find herself alone in her home as she would have wept\nfor Cesar dead.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Cesarine, sitting on her mother's knee, and caressing her\nwith the pretty kittenish grace which women only display to perfection\namongst themselves, \"you said that if I took up my life bravely, you\nwould have strength to bear adversity. Don't cry, dear mother; I am\nready and willing to go into some shop, and I shall never think again of\nwhat we once were. I shall be like you in your young days; and you shall\nnever hear a complaint, nor even a regret, from me. I have a hope. Did\nyou not hear what Monsieur Anselme said?\"\n\n\"That dear boy! he shall not be my son-in-law--\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"--he shall be my own son.\"\n\n\"Sorry has one good,\" said Cesarine, kissing her mother; \"it teaches us\nto know our true friends.\"\n\nThe daughter at last eased the pain of the poor woman by changing places\nand playing the mother to her. The next morning Constance went to the\nhouse of the Duc de Lenoncourt, one of the gentlemen of the king's\nbedchamber, and left a letter asking for an interview at a later hour\nof the day. In the interval she went to Monsieur de la Billardiere,\nand explained to him the situation in which Roguin's flight had placed\nCesar, begging him to go with her to the duke and speak for her, as she\nfeared she might explain matters ill herself. She wanted a place\nfor Birotteau. Birotteau, she said, would be the most upright of\ncashiers,--if there could be degrees of integrity among honest men.\n\n\"The King has just appointed the Comte de Fontaine master of his\nhousehold; there is no time to be lost in making the application,\" said\nthe mayor.\n\nAt two o'clock Monsieur de la Billardiere and Madame Cesar went up the\ngrand staircase of the Hotel de Lenoncourt, Rue Saint-Dominique, and\nwere ushered into the presence of the nobleman whom the king preferred\nto all others,--if it can be said that Louis XVIII. ever had a\npreference. The gracious welcome of this great lord, who belonged to the\nsmall number of true gentlemen whom the preceding century bequeathed\nto ours, encouraged Madame Cesar. She was dignified, yet simple, in her\nsorrow. Grief ennobles even the plainest people; for it has a grandeur\nof its own; to reflect its lustre, a nature must needs be true.\nConstance was a woman essentially true.\n\nThe question was, how to speak to the king at once. In the midst of the\nconference Monsieur de Vandenesse was announced; and the duke exclaimed,\n\"Here is our support!\"\n\nMadame Birotteau was not unknown to this young man, who had been to her\nshop two or three times in search of those trifles which are sometimes\nof more importance than greater things. The duke explained Monsieur de\nla Billardiere's wishes. As soon as he learned the misfortune which had\novertaken the godson of the Marquise d'Uxelles, Vandenesse went at once,\naccompanied by Monsieur de la Billardiere, to the Comte de Fontaine,\nbegging Madame Birotteau to wait their return. Monsieur le Comte\nde Fontaine was, like Monsieur de la Billardiere, one of those fine\nprovincial gentlemen, the heroes, almost unknown, who made \"la Vendee.\"\nBirotteau was not a stranger to him, for he had seen him in the old\ndays at \"The Queen of Roses.\" Men who had shed their blood for the\nroyal cause enjoyed at this time certain privileges, which the king kept\nsecret, so as not to give umbrage to the Liberals.\n\nMonsieur de Fontaine, always a favorite with Louis XVIII., was thought\nto be wholly in his confidence. Not only did the count positively\npromise a place, but he returned with the two gentlemen to the Duc\nde Lenoncourt, and asked him to procure for him an audience that very\nevening; and also to obtain for Billardiere an audience with MONSIEUR,\nwho was greatly attached to the old Vendeen diplomatist.\n\nThe same evening, the Comte de Fontaine came from the Tuileries to \"The\nQueen of Roses,\" and announced to Madame Birotteau that as soon as the\nproceedings in bankruptcy were over, her husband would be officially\nappointed to a situation in the Sinking-fund Office, with a salary of\ntwo thousand five hundred francs,--all the functions in the household of\nthe king being overcrowded with noble supernumeraries to whom promises\nhad already been made.\n\nThis success was but one part of the task before Madame Birotteau.\nThe poor woman now went to the \"Maison du Chat-qui-pelote,\" in the Rue\nSaint-Denis, to find Joseph Lebas. As she walked along she met Madame\nRoguin in a brilliant equipage, apparently making purchases. Their eyes\nmet; and the shame which the rich woman could not hide as she looked at\nthe ruined woman, gave Constance fresh courage.\n\n\"Never will I roll in a carriage bought with the money of others,\" she\nsaid to herself.\n\nJoseph Lebas received her kindly, and she begged him to obtain a place\nfor Cesarine in some respectable commercial establishment. Lebas made no\npromises; but eight days later Cesarine had board, lodging, and a salary\nof three thousand francs from one of the largest linen-drapers in\nParis, who was about to open a branch establishment in the quartier\ndes Italiens. Cesarine was put in charge of the desk, and the\nsuperintendence of the new shop was entrusted to her; she filled, in\nfact, a position above that of forewoman, and supplied the place of both\nmaster and mistress.\n\nMadame Cesar went from the \"Chat-qui-pelote\" to the Rue des\nCinq-Diamants, and asked Popinot to let her take charge of his accounts\nand do his writing, and also manage his household. Popinot felt that his\nwas the only house where Cesar's wife could meet with the respect that\nwas due to her, and find employment without humiliation. The noble lad\ngave her three thousand francs a year, her board, and his own room;\ngoing himself into an attic occupied by one of his clerks. Thus it\nhappened that the beautiful woman, after one month's enjoyment of her\nsumptuous home, came to live in the wretched chamber looking into a\ndamp, dark court, where Gaudissart, Anselme, and Finot had inaugurated\nCephalic Oil.\n\nWhen Molineux, appointed agent by the Court of Commerce, came to take\npossession of Cesar Birotteau's assets, Madame Birotteau, aided\nby Celestin, went over the inventory with him. Then the mother and\ndaughter, plainly dressed, left the house on foot and went to their\nuncle Pillerault's, without once turning their heads to look at the home\nwhere they had passed the greater part of their lives. They walked in\nsilence to the Rue des Bourdonnais, where they were to dine with Cesar\nfor the first time since their separation. It was a sad dinner. Each\nhad had time for reflection,--time to weigh the duties before them, and\nsound the depths of their courage. All three were like sailors ready\nto face foul weather, but not deceived as to their danger. Birotteau\ngathered courage as he was told of the interest people in high places\nhad taken in finding employment for him, but he wept when he heard what\nhis daughter was to become. Then he held out his hand to his wife, as he\nsaw the courage with which she had returned to labor. Old Pillerault's\neyes were wet, for the last time in his life, as he looked at these\nthree beings folded together in one embrace; from the centre of which\nBirotteau, feeblest of the three and the most stricken, raised his\nhands, saying:--\n\n\"Let us have hope!\"\n\n\"You shall live with me,\" said Pillerault, \"for the sake of economy; you\nshall have my chamber, and share my bread. I have long been lonely; you\nshall replace the poor child I lost. From my house it is but a step to\nyour office in the Rue de l'Oratoire.\"\n\n\"God of mercy!\" exclaimed Birotteau; \"in the worst of a storm a star\nguides me.\"\n\nResignation is the last stage of man's misfortune. From this moment\nCesar's downfall was accomplished; he accepted it, and strength returned\nto him.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nAfter admitting his insolvency and filing his schedule, a merchant\nshould find some retired spot in France, or in foreign countries, where\nhe may live without taking part in life, like the child that he is; for\nthe law declares him a minor, and not competent for any legal action as\na citizen. This, however, is never done. Before reappearing he obtains a\nsafe-conduct, which neither judge nor creditor ever refuses to give; for\nif the debtor were found without this _exeat_ he would be put in prison,\nwhile with it he passes safely, as with a flag of truce, through the\nenemy's camp,--not by way of curiosity, but for the purpose of defeating\nthe severe intention of the laws relating to bankruptcy. The effect of\nall laws which touch private interests is to develop, enormously, the\nknavery of men's minds. The object of a bankrupt, like that of other\npersons whose interests are thwarted by any law, is to make void the law\nin his particular case.\n\nThe status of civil death in which the bankrupt remains a chrysalis\nlasts for about three months,--a period required by formalities which\nprecede a conference at which the creditors and their debtor sign a\ntreaty of peace, by which the bankrupt is allowed the ability to make\npayments, and receives a bankrupt's certificate. This transaction is\ncalled the _concordat_,--a word implying, perhaps, that peace reigns\nafter the storm and stress of interests violently in opposition.\n\nAs soon as the insolvent's schedule is filed, the Court of commerce\nappoints a judge-commissioner, whose duty it is to look after the\ninterests of the still unknown body of creditors, and also to protect\nthe insolvent against the vexatious measures of angry creditors,--a\ndouble office, which might be nobly magnified if the judges had time\nto attend to it. The commissioner, however, delegates an agent to take\npossession of the property, the securities, and the merchandise, and to\nverify the schedule; when this is done, the court appoints a day for\na meeting of the creditors, notice of which is trumpeted forth in the\nnewspapers. The creditors, real or pretended, are expected to be present\nand choose the provisional assignees, who are to supersede the agent,\nstep into the insolvent's shoes, became by a fiction of law the\ninsolvent himself, and are authorized to liquidate the business,\nnegotiate all transactions, sell the property,--in short, recast\neverything in the interest of the creditors, provided the bankrupt makes\nno opposition. The majority of Parisian failures stop short at this\npoint, and the reason is as follows:\n\nThe appointment of one or more permanent assignees is an act which gives\nopportunity for the bitterest action on the part of creditors who\nare thirsting for vengeance, who have been tricked, baffled, cozened,\ntrapped, duped, robbed, and cheated. Although, as a general thing, all\ncreditors are cheated, robbed, duped, trapped, cozened, tricked, and\nbaffled, yet there is not in all Paris a commercial passion able to keep\nitself alive for ninety days. The paper of commerce alone maintains its\nvitality, and rises, athirst for payment, in three months. Before ninety\ndays are over, the creditors, worn out by coming and going, by the\nmarches and countermarches which a failure entails, are asleep at\nthe side of their excellent little wives. This may help a stranger to\nunderstand why it is that the provisional in France is so often the\ndefinitive: out of every thousand provisional assignees, not more than\nfive ever become permanent. The subsidence of passions stirred up by\nfailures is thus accounted for.\n\nBut here it becomes necessary to explain to persons who have not had the\nhappiness to be in business the whole drama of bankruptcy, so as to make\nthem understand how it constitutes in Paris a monstrous legal farce; and\nalso how the bankruptcy of Cesar Birotteau was a signal exception to the\ngeneral rule.\n\nThis fine commercial drama is in three distinct acts,--the agent's act,\nthe assignee's act, the _concordat_, or certificate-of-bankruptcy act.\nLike all theatrical performances, it is played with a double-intent:\nit is put upon the stage for the public eye, but it also has a hidden\npurpose; there is one performance for the pit, and another for the\nside-scenes. Posted in the side-scenes are the bankrupt and his\nsolicitor, the attorney of the creditors, the assignees, the agent, and\nthe judge-commissioner himself. No one out of Paris knows, and no one in\nParis does not know, that a judge of the commercial courts is the most\nextraordinary magistrate that society ever allowed itself to create.\nThis judge may live in dread of his own justice at any moment. Paris\nhas seen the president of her courts of commerce file his own schedule.\nInstead of being an experienced retired merchant, to whom the magistracy\nmight properly be made the reward of a pure life, this judge is a\ntrader, bending under the weight of enormous enterprises, and at the\nhead of some large commercial house. The _sine qua non_ condition in the\nelection of this functionary, whose business it is to pass judgment\non the avalanche of commercial suits incessantly rolling through the\ncourts, is that he shall have the greatest difficulty in managing his\nown affairs. This commercial tribunal, far from being made a useful\nmeans of transition whereby a merchant might rise, without ridicule,\ninto the ranks of the nobility, is in point of fact made up of traders\nwho are trading, and who are liable to suffer for their judgments when\nthey next meet with dissatisfied parties,--very much as Birotteau was\nnow punished by du Tillet.\n\nThe commissioner is of necessity a personage before whom much is said;\nwho listens, recollecting all the while his own interests, and leaves\nthe cause to the assignees and the attorneys,--except, possibly, in\na few strange and unusual cases where dishonesty is accompanied by\npeculiar circumstances, when the judge usually observes that the debtor,\nor the creditors, as it may happen, are clever people. This personage,\nset up in the drama like the royal bust in a public audience-chamber,\nmay be found early in the morning at his wood-yard, if he sells wood; in\nhis shop, if, like Birotteau, he is a perfumer; or, in the evenings,\nat his dessert after dinner,--always, it should be added, in a terrible\nhurry; as a general thing he is silent. Let us, however, do justice\nto the law: the legislation that governs his functions, and which was\npushed through in haste, has tied the hands of this commissioner; and\nit sometimes happens that he sanctions fraud which he cannot hinder,--as\nthe reader will shortly see.\n\nThe agent to whom the judge delegates the first proceedings, instead\nof serving the creditors, may become if he please a tool of the debtor.\nEvery one hopes to swell his own gains by getting on the right side of\nthe debtor, who is always supposed to keep back a hidden treasure. The\nagent may make himself useful to both parties; on the one hand by not\nlaying the bankrupt's business in ashes, on the other by snatching a few\nmorsels for men of influence,--in short, he runs with the hare and holds\nwith the hounds. A clever agent has frequently arrested judgment by\nbuying up the debts and then releasing the merchant, who then rebounds\nlike an india-rubber ball. The agent chooses the best-stocked crib,\nwhether it leads him to cover the largest creditors and shear the\ndebtor, or to sacrifice the creditors for the future prosperity of\nthe restored merchant. The action of the agent is decisive. This man,\ntogether with the bankrupt's solicitor, plays the utility role in the\ndrama, where it may be said neither the one nor the other would accept\na part if not sure of their fees. Taking the average of a thousand\nfailures, an agent would be found nine hundred and fifty times on the\nside of the bankrupt. At the period of our history, the solicitors\nfrequently sought the judge with the request that he would appoint\nan agent whom they proposed to him,--a man, as they said, to whom the\naffairs of the bankrupt were well-known, who would know how to reconcile\nthe interests of the whole body of creditors with those of a man\nhonorably overtaken by misfortune. For some years past the best judges\nhave sought the advice of the solicitors in this matter for the purpose\nof not taking it, endeavoring to appoint some other agent _quasi_\nvirtuous.\n\nDuring this act of the drama the creditors, real or pretended, come\nforward to select the provisional assignees, who are often, as we have\nsaid, the final ones. In this electoral assembly all creditors have the\nright to vote, whether the sum owing to them is fifty sous, or fifty\nthousand francs. This assembly, in which are found pretended creditors\nintroduced by the bankrupt,--the only electors who never fail to come\nto the meeting,--proposes the whole body of creditors as candidates from\namong whom the commissioner, a president without power, is supposed\nto select the assignees. Thus it happens that the judge almost always\nappoints as assignees those creditors whom it suits the bankrupt to\nhave,--another abuse which makes the catastrophe of bankruptcy one\nof the most burlesque dramas to which justice ever lent her name.\nThe honorable bankrupt overtaken by misfortune is then master of the\nsituation, and proceeds to legalize the theft he premeditated. As a\nrule, the petty trades of Paris are guiltless in this respect. When\na shopkeeper gets as far as making an assignment, the worthy man has\nusually sold his wife's shawl, pawned his plate, left no stone unturned,\nand succumbs at last with empty hands, ruined, and without enough money\nto pay his attorney, who in consequence cares little for him.\n\nThe law requires that the _concordat_, at which is granted the\nbankrupt's certificate that remits to the merchant a portion of his\ndebt, and restores to him the right of managing his affairs, shall\nbe attended by a majority of the creditors, and also that they shall\nrepresent a certain proportion of the debt. This important action brings\nout much clever diplomacy, on the part of the bankrupt, his assignees,\nand his solicitor, among the contending interests which cross and\njostle each other. A usual and very common manoeuvre is to offer to that\nsection of the creditors who make up in number and amount the majority\nrequired by law certain premiums, which the debtor consents to pay over\nand above the dividend publicly agreed upon. This monstrous fraud is\nwithout remedy. The thirty commercial courts which up to the present\ntime have followed one after the other, have each known of it, for all\nhave practised it. Enlightened by experience, they have lately tried to\nrender void such fraudulent agreements; and as the bankrupts have reason\nto complain of the extortion, the judges had some hope of reforming to\nthat extent the system of bankruptcy. The attempt, however, will end in\nproducing something still more immoral; for the creditors will devise\nother rascally methods, which the judges will condemn as judges, but by\nwhich they will profit as merchants.\n\nAnother much-used stratagem, and one to which we owe the term \"serious\nand legitimate creditor,\" is that of creating creditors,--just as du\nTillet created a banker and a banking-house,--and introducing a certain\nquantity of Claparons under whose skin the bankrupt hides, diminishing\nby just so much the dividends of the true creditors, and laying up for\nthe honest man a store for the future; always, however, providing a\nsufficient majority of votes and debts to secure the passage of his\ncertificate. The \"gay and illegitimate creditors\" are like false\nelectors admitted into the electoral college. What chance has the\n\"serious and legitimate creditor\" against the \"gay and illegitimate\ncreditor?\" Shall he get rid of him by attacking him? How can he do it?\nTo drive out the intruder the legitimate creditor must sacrifice his\ntime, his own business, and pay an attorney to help him; while the said\nattorney, making little out of it, prefers to manage the bankruptcy in\nanother capacity, and therefore works for the genuine credit without\nvigor.\n\nTo dislodge the illegitimate creditor it is necessary to thread the\nlabyrinth of proceedings in bankruptcy, search among past events,\nransack accounts, obtain by injunction the books of the false creditors,\nshow the improbability of the fiction of their existence, prove it to\nthe judges, sue for justice, go and come, and stir up sympathy; and,\nfinally, to charge like Don Quixote upon each \"gay and illegitimate\ncreditor,\" who if convicted of \"gaiety\" withdraws from court, saying\nwith a bow to the judges, \"Excuse me, you are mistaken, I am very\n'serious.'\" All this without prejudice to the rights of the bankrupt,\nwho may carry Don Quixote and his remonstrance to the upper courts;\nduring which time Don Quixote's own business is suffering, and he is\nliable to become a bankrupt himself.\n\nThe upshot of all this is, that in point of fact the debtor appoints\nhis assignees, audits his own accounts, and draws up the certificate of\nbankruptcy himself.\n\nGiven these premises, it is easy to imagine the devices of Frontin, the\ntrickeries of Sganarelle, the lies of Mascarille, and the empty bags\nof Scapin which such a system develops. There has never been a failure\nwhich did not generate enough matter to fill the fourteen volumes of\n\"Clarissa Harlowe,\" if an author could be found to describe them. A\nsingle example will suffice. The illustrious Gobseck,--ruler of Palma,\nGigonnet, Werbrust, Keller, Nucingen, and the like,--being concerned in\na failure where he attempted to roughly handle the insolvent, who had\nmanaged to get the better of him, obtained notes from his debtor for an\namount which together with the declared dividend made up the sum total\nof his loss. These notes were to fall due after the _concordat_. Gobseck\nthen brought about a settlement in the _concordat_ by which sixty-five\nper cent was remitted to the bankrupt. Thus the creditors were swindled\nin the interests of Gobseck. But the bankrupt had signed the illicit\nnotes with the name of his insolvent firm, and he was therefore able\nto bring them under the reduction of sixty-five per cent. Gobseck, the\ngreat Gobseck, received scarcely fifty per cent on his loss. From that\nday forth he bowed to his debtor with ironical respect.\n\nAs all operations undertaken by an insolvent within ten days before his\nfailure can be impeached, prudent men are careful to enter upon certain\naffairs with a certain number of creditors whose interest, like that\nof the bankrupt, is to arrive at the _concordat_ as fast as possible.\nSkilful creditors will approach dull creditors or very busy ones, give\nan ugly look into the failure, and buy up their claims at half what\nthey are worth at the liquidation; in this way they get back their money\npartly by the dividend on their own claims, partly from the half, or\nthird, or fourth, gained on these purchased claims.\n\nA failure is the closer, more or less hermetically tight, of a house\nwhere pillage has left a few remaining bags of silver. Lucky the man who\ncan get in at a window, slide down a chimney, creep in through a cellar\nor through a hole, and seize a bag to swell his share! In the general\nrout, the _sauve qui peut_ of Beresina is passed from mouth to mouth;\nall is legal and illegal, false and true, honest and dishonest. A man is\nadmired if he \"covers\" himself. To \"cover\" himself means that he seizes\nsecurities to the detriment of the other creditors. France has lately\nrung with the discussion of an immense failure that took place in a town\nwhere one of the upper courts holds its sittings, and where the judges,\nhaving current accounts with the bankrupts, wore such heavy india-rubber\nmantles that the mantle of justice was rubbed into holes. It was\nabsolutely necessary, in order to avert legitimate suspicion, to send\nthe case for judgment in another court. There was neither judge nor\nagent nor supreme court in the region where the failure took place that\ncould be trusted.\n\nThis alarming commercial tangle is so well understood in Paris, that\nunless a merchant is involved to a large amount he accepts a failure\nas total shipwreck without insurance, passes it to his profit-and-loss\naccount, and does not commit the folly of wasting time upon it; he\ncontents himself with brewing his own malt. As to the petty trader,\nworried about his monthly payments, busied in pushing the chariot of his\nlittle fortunes, a long and costly legal process terrifies him. He gives\nup trying to see his way, imitates the substantial merchant, bows his\nhead, and accepts his loss.\n\nThe wholesale merchants seldom fail, nowadays; they make friendly\nliquidations; the creditors take what is given to them, and hand in\ntheir receipts. In this way many things are avoided,--dishonor, judicial\ndelays, fees to lawyers, and the depreciation of merchandise.\nAll parties think that bankruptcy will give less in the end than\nliquidation. There are now more liquidations than bankruptcies in Paris.\n\nThe assignee's act in the drama is intended to prove that every assignee\nis incorruptible, and that no collusion has ever existed between any\nof them and the bankrupt. The pit--which has all, more or less, been\nassignee in its day--knows very well that every assignee is a \"covered\"\nmerchant. It listens, and believes as it likes. After three months\nemployed in auditing the debtor and creditor accounts, the time comes\nfor the _concordat_. The provisional assignees make a little report at\nthe meeting, of which the following is the usual formula:--\n\n  Messieurs,--There is owing to the whole of us, in bulk, about a\n  million. We have dismantled our man like a condemned frigate. The\n  nails, iron, wood, and copper will bring about three hundred\n  thousand francs. We shall thus get about thirty per cent of our\n  money. Happy in obtaining this amount, when our debtor might have\n  left us only one hundred thousand, we hereby declare him an\n  Aristides; we vote him a premium and crown of encouragement, and\n  propose to leave him to manage his assets, giving him ten or\n  twelve years in which to pay us the fifty per cent which he has\n  been so good as to offer us. Here is the certificate of\n  bankruptcy; have the goodness to walk up to the desk and sign it.\n\nAt this speech, all the fortune creditors congratulate each other and\nshake hands. After the ratification of the certificate, the bankrupt\nbecomes once more a merchant, precisely such as he was before; he\nreceives back his securities, he continues his business, he is not\ndeprived of the power to fail again, on the promised dividend,--an\nadditional little failure which often occurs, like the birth of a child\nnine months after the mother has married her daughter.\n\nIf the certificate of bankruptcy is not granted, the creditors then\nselect the permanent assignees, take extreme measures, and form an\nassociation to get possession of the whole property and the business\nof their debtor, seizing everything that he has or ever will have,--his\ninheritance from his father, his mother, his aunt, _et caetera_.\nThis stern measure can only be carried through by an association of\ncreditors.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThere are therefore two sorts of failures,--the failure of the merchant\nwho means to repossess himself of his business, and the failure of the\nmerchant who has fallen into the water and is willing to sink to the\nbottom. Pillerault knew the difference. It was, to his thinking and to\nthat of Ragon, as hard to come out pure from the first as to come out\nsafe from the second. After advising Cesar to abandon everything to his\ncreditors, he went to the most honorable solicitor in such matters,\nthat immediate steps might be taken to liquidate the failure and put\neverything at once at the disposition of the creditors. The law requires\nthat while the drama is being acted, the creditors shall provide for\nthe support of the bankrupt and his family. Pillerault notified the\ncommissioner that he would himself supply the wants of his niece and\nnephew.\n\nDu Tillet had worked all things together to make the failure a prolonged\nagony for his old master; and this is how he did it. Time is so precious\nin Paris that it is customary, when two assignees are appointed, for\nonly one to attend to the affair: the duty of the other is merely\nformal,--he approves and signs, like the second notary in notarial\ndeeds. By this means, the largest failures in Paris are so vigorously\nhandled that, in spite of the law's delays, they are adjusted, settled,\nand secured with such rapidity that within a hundred days the judge can\necho the atrocious saying of the Minister,--\"Order reigns in Warsaw.\"\n\nDu Tillet meant to compass Cesar's commercial death. The names of\nthe assignees selected through the influence of du Tillet were very\nsignificant to Pillerault. Monsieur Bidault, called Gigonnet,--the\nprincipal creditor,--was the one to take no active part; and Molineux,\nthe mischievous old man who lost nothing by the failure, was to manage\neverything. Du Tillet flung the noble commercial carcass to the little\njackal, that he might torment it as he devoured it. After the meeting\nat which the creditors appointed the assignees, little Molineux returned\nhome \"honored,\" so he said, \"by the suffrages of his fellow-citizens\";\nhappy in the prospect of hectoring Birotteau, just as a child\ndelights in having an insect to maltreat. The landlord, astride of his\nhobby,--the law,--begged du Tillet to favor him with his ideas; and he\nbought a copy of the commercial Code. Happily, Joseph Lebas, cautioned\nby Pillerault, had already requested the president of the Board\nof Commerce to select a sagacious and well-meaning commissioner.\nGobenheim-Keller, whom du Tillet hoped to have, found himself displaced\nby Monsieur Camusot, a substitute-judge,--a rich silk-merchant, Liberal\nin politics, and the owner of the house in which Pillerault lived; a man\ncounted honorable.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nOne of the cruellest scenes of Cesar's life was his forced conference\nwith little Molineux,--the being he had once regarded as a nonentity,\nwho now by a fiction of law had become Cesar Birotteau. He was compelled\nto go to the Cour Batave, to mount the six flights, and re-enter the\nmiserable appartement of the old man, now his custodian, his _quasi_\njudge,--the representative of his creditors. Pillerault accompanied him.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said the old man, as Cesar gave vent to an\nexclamation.\n\n\"Ah, uncle! you do not know the sort of man this Molineux is!\"\n\n\"I have seen him from time to time for fifteen years past at the cafe\nDavid, where he plays dominoes. That is why I have come with you.\"\n\nMonsieur Molineux showed the utmost politeness to Pillerault, and much\ndisdainful condescension to the bankrupt; he had thought over his part,\nstudied the shades of his demeanor, and prepared his ideas.\n\n\"What information is it that you need?\" asked Pillerault. \"There is no\ndispute as to the claims.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said little Molineux, \"the claims are in order,--they have been\nexamined. The creditors are all serious and legitimate. But the\nlaw, monsieur,--the law! The expenditures of the bankrupt have been\ndisproportional to his fortune. It appears that the ball--\"\n\n\"At which you were present,\" interrupted Pillerault.\n\n\"--cost nearly sixty thousand francs, and at that time the assets of\nthe insolvent amounted to not more than one hundred and a few thousand\nfrancs. There is cause to arraign the bankrupt on a charge of wilful\nbankruptcy.\"\n\n\"Is that your intention?\" said Pillerault, noticing the despondency into\nwhich these words had cast Birotteau.\n\n\"Monsieur, I make a distinction; the Sieur Birotteau was a member of the\nmunicipality--\"\n\n\"You have not sent for us, I presume, to explain that we are to be\nbrought into a criminal police court?\" said Pillerault. \"The cafe David\nwould laugh finely at your conduct this evening.\"\n\nThe opinion of the cafe David seemed to frighten the old man, who looked\nat Pillerault with a startled air. He had counted on meeting Birotteau\nalone, intending to pose as the sovereign arbiter of his fate,--a\nlegal Jupiter. He meant to frighten him with the thunder-bolt of an\naccusation, to brandish the axe of a criminal charge over his head,\nenjoy his fears and his terrors, and then allow himself to be touched\nand softened, and persuaded at last to restore his victim to a life of\nperpetual gratitude. Instead of his insect, he had got hold of an old\ncommercial sphinx.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he replied, \"I see nothing to laugh at.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Pillerault. \"You have negotiated largely with Monsieur\nClaparon; you have neglected the interests of the main body of\nthe creditors, so as to make sure that certain claims shall have\na preference. Now I can as one of the creditors interfere. The\ncommissioner is to be taken into account.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Molineux, \"I am incorruptible.\"\n\n\"I am aware of it,\" said Pillerault. \"You have only taken your iron out\nof the fire, as they say. You are keen; you are acting just as you do\nwith your tenants--\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\" said the assignee, suddenly dropping into the\nlandlord,--just as the cat metamorphosed into a woman ran after a mouse\nwhen she caught sight of it,--\"my affair of the Rue Montorgeuil is not\nyet settled. What they call an impediment has arisen. The tenant is the\nchief tenant. This conspirator declares that as he has paid a year in\nadvance, and having only one more year to\"--here Pillerault gave Cesar\na look which advised him to pay strict attention--\"and, the year being\npaid for, that he has the right to take away his furniture. I shall sue\nhim! I must hold on to my securities to the last; he may owe something\nfor repairs before the year is out.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Pillerault, \"the law only allows you to take furniture as\nsecurity for the rent--\"\n\n\"And its accessories!\" cried Molineux, assailed in his trenches. \"That\narticle in the Code has been interpreted by various judgments rendered\nin the matter: however, there ought to be legislative rectification to\nit. At this very moment I am elaborating a memorial to his Highness,\nthe Keeper of the Seals, relating to this flaw in our statutes. It\nis desirable that the government should maintain the interests of\nlandlords. That is the chief question in statecraft. We are the tap-root\nof taxation.\"\n\n\"You are well fitted to enlighten the government,\" said Pillerault; \"but\nin what way can we enlighten you--about our affairs?\"\n\n\"I wish to know,\" said Molineux, with pompous authority, \"if Monsieur\nBirotteau has received moneys from Monsieur Popinot.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" said Birotteau.\n\nThen followed a discussion on Birotteau's interests in the house of\nPopinot, from which it appeared that Popinot had the right to have all\nhis advances paid in full, and that he was not involved in the failure\nto the amount of half the costs of his establishment, due to him by\nBirotteau. Molineux, judiciously handled by Pillerault, insensibly got\nback to gentler ways, which only showed how he cared for the opinion of\nthose who frequented the cafe David. He ended by offering consolation\nto Birotteau, and by inviting him, as well as Pillerault, to share his\nhumble dinner. If the ex-perfumer had gone alone, he would probably have\nirritated Molineux, and the matter would have become envenomed. In this\ninstance, as in others, old Pillerault was his tutelary angel.\n\nCommercial law imposes a horrible torture upon the bankrupt; he is\ncompelled to appear in person at the meeting of his creditors, when they\ndecide upon his future fate. For a man who can hold himself above it\nall, or for a merchant who expects to recover himself, this ceremony is\nlittle feared. But to a man like Cesar Birotteau it was agony only to\nbe compared to the last day of a criminal condemned to death. Pillerault\ndid all in his power to make that terrible day endurable to his nephew.\n\nThe steps taken by Molineux, and agreed to by the bankrupt, were as\nfollows: The suit relating to the mortgage on the property in the\nFaubourg du Temple having been won in the courts, the assignees decided\nto sell that property, and Cesar made no opposition. Du Tillet, hearing\nprivately that the government intended to cut a canal which should lead\nfrom Saint-Denis to the upper Seine through the Faubourg du Temple,\nbought the property of Birotteau for seventy thousand francs. All\nCesar's rights in the lands about the Madeleine were turned over to\nMonsieur Claparon, on condition that he on his side would abandon all\nclaim against Birotteau for half the costs of drawing up and registering\nthe contracts; also for all payments on the price of the lands, by\nreceiving himself, under the failure, the dividend which was to be\npaid over to the sellers. The interests of the perfumer in the house\nof Popinot and Company were sold to the said Popinot for the sum of\nforty-eight thousand francs. The business of \"The Queen of Roses\" was\nbought by Celestin Crevel at fifty-seven thousand francs, with the\nlease, the fixtures, the merchandise, furniture, and all rights in the\nPaste of Sultans and the Carminative Balm, with twelve years' lease of\nthe manufactories, whose various appliances were also sold to him. The\nassets when liquidated came to one hundred and ninety-five thousand\nfrancs, to which the assignees added seventy thousand produced by\nBirotteau's claims in the liquidation of the \"unfortunate\" Roguin. Thus\nthe total amount made over to Cesar's creditors was two hundred and\nfifty-five thousand francs. The debts amounted to four hundred and forty\nthousand; consequently, the creditors received more than fifty per cent\non their claims.\n\nBankruptcy is a species of chemical transmutation, from which a clever\nmerchant tries to emerge in fresh shape. Birotteau, distilled to the\nlast drop in this retort, gave a result which made du Tillet furious.\nDu Tillet looked to see a dishonorable failure; he saw an honorable one.\nCaring little for his own gains, though he was about to get\npossession of the lands around the Madeleine without ever drawing his\npurse-strings, he wanted to see his old master dishonored, lost, and\nvilified. The creditors at the general meeting would undoubtedly show\nthe poor man that they respected him.\n\nBy degrees, as Birotteau's courage came back to him, Pillerault, like\na wise doctor, informed him, by gradual doses, of the transactions\nresulting from his failure. These harsh tidings were like so many blows.\nA merchant cannot learn without a shock the depreciation of property\nwhich represents to him so much money, so much solicitude, so much\nlabor. The facts his uncle now told him petrified the poor man.\n\n\"Fifty-seven thousand francs for 'The Queen of Roses'! Why, the shop\nalone cost ten thousand; the appartement cost forty thousand; the mere\noutlay on the manufactories, the utensils, the frames, the boilers, cost\nthirty thousand. Why! at fifty per cent abatement, if my creditors allow\nme that, there would still be ten thousand francs worth of property in\nthe shop. Why! the Paste and the Balm are solid property,--worth as much\nas a farm!\"\n\nPoor Cesar's jeremiads made no impression upon Pillerault. The old\nmerchant took them as a horse takes a down-pour; but he was alarmed by\nthe gloomy silence Birotteau maintained when it was a question of the\nmeeting. Those who comprehend the vanities and weaknesses which in all\nsocial spheres beset mankind, will know what a martyrdom it was for this\npoor man to enter as a bankrupt the commercial tribunal of justice\nwhere he once sat as judge; to meet affronts where so often he had been\nthanked for services rendered,--he, Birotteau, whose inflexible opinions\nabout bankruptcy were so well known; he who had said, \"A man may be\nhonest till he fails, but he comes out of a meeting of his creditors\na swindler.\" Pillerault watched for the right moment to familiarize\nCesar's mind with the thought of appearing before his creditors as the\nlaw demands. The thought killed him. His mute grief and resignation made\na deep impression on his uncle, who often heard him at night, through\nthe partition, crying out to himself, \"Never! never! I will die sooner.\"\n\nPillerault, a strong man,--strong through the simplicity of his\nlife,--was able to understand weakness. He resolved to spare Cesar the\nanguish of appearing before his creditors,--a terrible scene which the\nlaw renders inevitable, and to which, indeed, he might succumb. On this\npoint the law is precise, formal, and not to be evaded. The merchant\nwho refused to appear would, for that act alone, be brought before\nthe criminal police courts. But though the law compels the bankrupt to\nappear, it has no power to oblige the creditor to do so. A meeting\nof creditors is a ceremony of no real importance except in special\ncases,--when, for instance, a swindler is to be dispossessed and a\ncoalition among the creditors agreed upon, when there is difference of\nopinion between the privileged creditors and the unsecured creditors, or\nwhen the _concordat_ is specially dishonest, and the bankrupt is in need\nof a deceptive majority. But in the case of a failure when all has\nbeen given up, the meeting is a mere formality. Pillerault went to each\ncreditor, one after the other, and asked him to give his proxy to his\nattorney. Every creditor, except du Tillet, sincerely pitied Cesar,\nafter striking him down. Each knew that his conduct was scrupulously\nhonest, that his books were regular, and his business as clear as the\nday. All were pleased to find no \"gay and illegitimate creditor\" among\nthem. Molineux, first the agent and then the provisional assignee, had\nfound in Cesar's house everything the poor man owned, even the engraving\nof Hero and Leander which Popinot had given him, his personal trinkets,\nhis breast-pin, his gold buckles, his two watches,--things which an\nhonest man might have taken without thinking himself less than honest.\nConstance had left her modest jewel-case. This touching obedience to\nthe law struck the commercial mind keenly. Birotteau's enemies called\nit foolishness; but men of sense held it up to its true light as a\nmagnificent supererogation of integrity. In two months the opinion of\nthe Bourse had changed; every one, even those who were most indifferent,\nadmitted this failure to be a rare commercial wonder, seldom seen in the\nmarkets of Paris. Thus the creditors, knowing that they were secure\nof nearly sixty per cent of their claims, were very ready to do what\nPillerault asked of them. The solicitors of the commercial courts are\nfew in number; it therefore happened that several creditors employed\nthe same man, giving him their proxies. Pillerault finally succeeded in\nreducing the formidable assemblage to three solicitors, himself, Ragon,\nthe two assignees, and the commissioner.\n\nEarly in the morning of the solemn day, Pillerault said to his nephew,--\n\n\"Cesar, you can go to your meeting to-day without fear; nobody will be\nthere.\"\n\nMonsieur Ragon wished to accompany his debtor. When the former master of\n\"The Queen of Roses\" first made known the wish in his little dry voice,\nhis ex-successor turned pale; but the good old man opened his arms,\nand Birotteau threw himself into them as a child into the arms of its\nfather, and the two perfumers mingled their tears. The bankrupt gathered\ncourage as he felt the indulgences shown to him, and he got into the\ncoach with his uncle and Ragon. Precisely at half past ten o'clock the\nthree reached the cloister Saint-Merri, where the Court of Commerce was\nthen held. At that hour there was no one in the Hall of Bankruptcy. The\nday and the hour had been chosen by agreement with the judge and the\nassignees. The three solicitors were already there on behalf of their\nclients. There was nothing, therefore, to distress or intimidate Cesar\nBirotteau; yet the poor man could not enter the office of Monsieur\nCamusot--which chanced to be the one he had formerly occupied--without\ndeep emotion, and he shuddered as he passed through the Hall of\nBankruptcy.\n\n\"It is cold,\" said Monsieur Camusot to Birotteau. \"I am sure these\ngentlemen will not be sorry to stay here, instead of our going to freeze\nin the Hall.\" He did not say the word \"Bankruptcy.\" \"Gentlemen, be\nseated.\"\n\nEach took his seat, and the judge gave his own armchair to Birotteau,\nwho was bewildered. The solicitors and the assignees signed the papers.\n\n\"In consideration of the surrender of your entire property,\" said\nCamusot to Birotteau, \"your creditors unanimously agree to relinquish\nthe rest of their claims. Your certificate is couched in terms which\nmay well soften your pain; your solicitor will see that it is promptly\nrecorded; you are now free. All the judges of this court, dear Monsieur\nBirotteau,\" said Camusot, taking him by the hand, \"feel for your\nposition, and are not surprised at your courage; none have failed to do\njustice to your integrity. In the midst of a great misfortune you have\nbeen worthy of what you once were here. I have been in business for\ntwenty years, and this is only the second time that I have seen a fallen\nmerchant gaining, instead of losing, public respect.\"\n\nBirotteau took the hands of the judge and wrung them, with tears in his\neyes. Camusot asked him what he now meant to do. Birotteau replied that\nhe should work till he had paid his creditors in full to the last penny.\n\n\"If to accomplish that noble task you should ever want a few thousand\nfrancs, you will always find them with me,\" said Camusot. \"I would give\nthem with a great deal of pleasure to witness a deed so rare in Paris.\"\n\nPillerault, Ragon, and Birotteau retired.\n\n\"Well! that wasn't the ocean to drink,\" said Pillerault, as they left\nthe court-room.\n\n\"I recognize your hand in it,\" said the poor man, much affected.\n\n\"Now, here you are, free, and we are only a few steps from the Rue des\nCinq-Diamants; come and see my nephew,\" said Ragon.\n\nA cruel pang shot through Cesar's heart when he saw Constance sitting\nin a little office in the damp, dark _entresol_ above the shop, whose\nsingle window was one third darkened by a sign which intercepted the\ndaylight and bore the name,--A. POPINOT.\n\n\"Behold a lieutenant of Alexander,\" said Cesar, with the gaiety of\ngrief, pointing to the sign.\n\nThis forced gaiety, through which an inextinguishable sense of the\nsuperiority which Birotteau attributed to himself was naively revealed,\nmade Ragon shudder in spite of his seventy years. Cesar saw his wife\npassing down letters and papers for Popinot to sign; he could neither\nrestrain his tears nor keep his face from turning pale.\n\n\"Good-morning, my friend,\" she said to him, smiling.\n\n\"I do not ask if you are comfortable here,\" said Cesar, looking at\nPopinot.\n\n\"As if I were living with my own son,\" she answered, with a tender\nmanner that struck her husband.\n\nBirotteau took Popinot and kissed him, saying,--\n\n\"I have lost the right, forever, of calling him my son.\"\n\n\"Let us hope!\" said Popinot. \"_Your_ oil succeeds--thanks to my\nadvertisements in the newspapers, and to Gaudissart, who has travelled\nover the whole of France; he has inundated the country with placards and\nprospectuses; he is now at Strasburg getting the prospectuses printed in\nthe German language, and he is about to descend, like an invasion, upon\nGermany itself. We have received orders for three thousand gross.\"\n\n\"Three thousand gross!\" exclaimed Cesar.\n\n\"And I have bought a piece of land in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau,--not\ndear,--where I am building a manufactory.\"\n\n\"Wife,\" whispered Cesar to Constance, \"with a little help we might have\npulled through.\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nAfter that fatal day Cesar, his wife, and daughter understood\neach other. The poor clerk resolved to attain an end which, if not\nimpossible, was at least gigantic in its enterprise,--namely, the\npayment of his debts to their last penny. These three beings,--father,\nmother, daughter,--bound together by the tie of a passionate integrity,\nbecame misers, denying themselves everything; a farthing was sacred in\ntheir eyes. Out of sheer calculation Cesarine threw herself into her\nbusiness with the devotion of a young girl. She sat up at night,\ntaxing her ingenuity to find ways of increasing the prosperity of the\nestablishment, and displaying an innate commercial talent. The masters\nof the house were obliged to check her ardor for work; they rewarded her\nby presents, but she refused all articles of dress and the jewels which\nthey offered her. Money! money! was her cry. Every month she carried her\nsalary and her little earnings to her uncle Pillerault. Cesar did the\nsame; so did Madame Birotteau. All three, feeling themselves incapable,\ndared not take upon themselves the responsibility of managing their\nmoney, and they made over to Pillerault the whole business of investing\ntheir savings. Returning thus to business, the latter made the most of\nthese funds by negotiations at the Bourse. It was known afterwards that\nhe had been helped in this work by Jules Desmarets and Joseph Lebas,\nboth of whom were eager to point out opportunities which Pillerault\nmight take without risk.\n\nCesar, though he lived with his uncle, never ventured to question him\nas to what was done with the money acquired by his labor and that of his\nwife and daughter. He walked the streets with a bowed head, hiding\nfrom every eye his stricken, dull, distraught face. He felt, with\nself-reproach, that the cloth he wore was too good for him.\n\n\"At least,\" he said to Pillerault, with a look that was angelic, \"I do\nnot eat the bread of my creditors. Your bread is sweet to me, though\nit is your pity that gives it; thanks to your sacred charity, I do not\nsteal a farthing of my salary!\"\n\nThe merchants, his old associates, who met the clerk could see no\nvestige of the perfumer. Even careless minds gained an idea of the\nimmensity of human disaster from the aspect of this man, on whose face\nsorrow had cast its black pall, who revealed the havoc caused by that\nwhich had never before appeared in him,--by thought! _N'est pas detruit\nqui veut_. Light-minded people, devoid of conscience, to whom all\nthings are indifferent, can never present such a spectacle of disaster.\nReligion alone sets a special seal upon fallen human beings; they\nbelieve in a future, in a divine Providence; from within them gleams a\nlight that marks them, a look of saintly resignation mingled with hope,\nwhich lends them a certain tender emotion; they realize all that\nthey have lost, like the exiled angel weeping at the gates of heaven.\nBankrupts are forbidden to enter the Bourse. Cesar, driven from the\nregions of integrity, was like an angel sighing for pardon. For fourteen\nmonths he lived on, full of religious thoughts with which his fall\ninspired him, and denying himself every pleasure. Though sure of the\nRagons' friendship, nothing could induce him to dine with them, nor with\nthe Lebas, nor the Matifats, nor the Protez and Chiffrevilles, not even\nwith Monsieur Vauquelin; all of whom were eager to do honor to his rare\nvirtue. Cesar preferred to be alone in his room rather than meet the\neye of a creditor. The warmest greetings of his friends reminded him the\nmore bitterly of his position. Constance and Cesarine went nowhere. On\nSundays and fete days, the only days when they were at liberty, the two\nwomen went to fetch Cesar at the hour for Mass, and they stayed with\nhim at Pillerault's after their religious duties were accomplished.\nPillerault often invited the Abbe Loraux, whose words sustained Cesar\nin this life of trial. And in this way their lives were spent. The old\nironmonger had too tough a fibre of integrity not to approve of Cesar's\nsensitive honor. His mind, however, turned on increasing the number of\npersons among whom the poor bankrupt might show himself with an open\nbrow, and an eye that could meet the eyes of his fellows.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nIn the month of May, 1821, this family, ever grappling with adversity,\nreceived a first reward for its efforts at a little fete which\nPillerault, the arbiter of its destinies, prepared for it. The last\nSunday of that month was the anniversary of the day on which Constance\nhad consented to marry Cesar. Pillerault, in concert with the Ragons,\nhired a little country-house at Sceaux, and the worthy old ironmonger\nsilently prepared a joyous house-warming.\n\n\"Cesar,\" said Pillerault, on the Saturday evening, \"to-morrow we are all\ngoing into the country, and you must come.\"\n\nCesar, who wrote a superb hand, spent his evenings in copying for\nDerville and other lawyers. On Sundays, justified by ecclesiastical\npermission, he worked like a Negro.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"Monsieur Derville is waiting for a guardianship\naccount.\"\n\n\"Your wife and daughter ought to have some reward. You will meet none\nbut our particular friends,--the Abbe Loraux, the Ragons, Popinot, and\nhis uncle. Besides, I wish it.\"\n\nCesar and his wife, carried along by the whirlwind of business, had\nnever revisited Sceaux, though from time to time each longed to see once\nmore the tree under which the head-clerk of \"The Queen of Roses\" had\nfainted with joy. During the trip, which Cesar made in a hackney-coach\nwith his wife and daughter, and Popinot who escorted them, Constance\ncast many meaning glances at her husband without bringing to his lips\na single smile. She whispered a few words in his ear; for all answer he\nshook his head. The soft signs of her tenderness, ever-present yet at\nthe moment forced, instead of brightening Cesar's face made it more\nsombre, and brought the long-repressed tears into his eyes. Poor man! he\nhad gone over this road twenty years before, young, prosperous, full\nof hope, the lover of a girl as beautiful as their own Cesarine; he was\ndreaming then of happiness. To-day, in the coach before him, sat his\nnoble child pale and worn by vigils, and his brave wife, whose only\nbeauty now was that of cities through whose streets have flowed the\nlava waves of a volcano. Love alone remained to him! Cesar's sadness\nsmothered the joy that welled up in the hearts of Cesarine and Anselme,\nwho embodied to his eyes the charming scene of other days.\n\n\"Be happy, my children! you have earned the right,\" said the poor father\nin heart-rending tones. \"You may love without one bitter thought.\"\n\nAs he said these words he took his wife's hands and kissed them with\na sacred and admiring effect which touched Constance more than the\nbrightest gaiety. When they reached the house where Pillerault, the\nRagons, the Abbe Loraux, and Popinot the judge were waiting for them,\nthese five choice people assumed an air and manner and speech which put\nCesar at his ease; for all were deeply moved to see him still on the\nmorrow of his great disaster.\n\n\"Go and take a walk in the Aulnay woods,\" said Pillerault, putting\nCesar's hand into that of Constance; \"go with Anselme and Cesarine! but\ncome back by four o'clock.\"\n\n\"Poor souls, we should be a restraint upon them,\" said Madame Ragon,\ntouched by the deep grief of her debtor. \"He will be very happy\npresently.\"\n\n\"It is repentance without sin,\" said the Abbe Loraux.\n\n\"He could rise to greatness only through adversity,\" said the judge.\n\nTo forget is the great secret of strong, creative natures,--to forget,\nin the way of Nature herself, who knows no past, who begins afresh, at\nevery hour, the mysteries of her untiring travail.\n\nFeeble existences, like that of Birotteau, live sunk in sorrows, instead\nof transmuting them into doctrines of experience: they let them saturate\ntheir being, and are worn-out, finally, by falling more and more under\nthe weight of past misfortunes.\n\nWhen the two couples reached the path which leads to the woods\nof Aulnay, placed like a crown upon the prettiest hillside in the\nneighborhood of Paris, and from which the Vallee-aux-Loups is seen in\nall its coquetry, the beauty of the day, the charm of the landscape, the\nfirst spring verdure, the delicious memory of the happiest day of all\nhis youth, loosened the tight chords in Cesar's soul; he pressed the arm\nof his wife against his beating heart; his eye was no longer glassy, for\nthe light of pleasure once more brightened in it.\n\n\"At last,\" said Constance to her husband, \"I see you again, my poor\nCesar. I think we have all behaved well enough to allow ourselves a\nlittle pleasure now and then.\"\n\n\"Ought I?\" said the poor man. \"Ah! Constance, thy affection is all that\nremains to me. Yes, I have lost even my old self-confidence; I have no\nstrength left; my only desire is that I may live to die discharged of\ndebt on earth. Thou, dear wife, thou who art my wisdom and my prudence,\nthou whose eyes saw clear, thou who art irreproachable, thou canst have\npleasure. I alone--of us three--am guilty. Eighteen months ago, in the\nmidst of that fatal ball, I saw my Constance, the only woman I have ever\nloved, more beautiful than the young girl I followed along this path\ntwenty years ago--like our children yonder! In eighteen months I have\nblasted that beauty,--my pride, my legitimate and sanctioned pride. I\nlove thee better since I know thee well. Oh, _dear_!\" he said, giving to\nthe word a tone which reached to the inmost heart of his wife, \"I would\nrather have thee scold me, than see thee so tender to my pain.\"\n\n\"I did not think,\" she said, \"that after twenty years of married life\nthe love of a wife for her husband could deepen.\"\n\nThese words drove from Cesar's mind, for one brief moment, all his\nsorrows; his heart was so true that they were to him a fortune. He\nwalked forward almost joyously to _their_ tree, which by chance had not\nbeen felled. Husband and wife sat down beneath it, watching Anselme and\nCesarine, who were sauntering across the grassy slope without perceiving\nthem, thinking probably that they were still following.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" Anselme was saying, \"do not think me so base and\ngrasping as to profit by your father's share which I have acquired\nin the Cephalic Oil. I am keeping his share for him; I nurse it with\ncareful love. I invest the profits; if there is any loss I put it to\nmy own account. We can only belong to one another on the day when your\nfather is restored to his position, free of debt. I work for that day\nwith all the strength that love has given me.\"\n\n\"Will it come soon?\" she said.\n\n\"Soon,\" said Popinot. The word was uttered in a tone so full of meaning,\nthat the chaste and pure young girl inclined her head to her dear\nAnselme, who laid an eager and respectful kiss upon her brow,--so noble\nwas her gesture and action.\n\n\"Papa, all is well,\" she said to Cesar with a little air of confidence.\n\"Be good and sweet; talk to us, put away that sad look.\"\n\nWhen this family, so tenderly bound together, re-entered the house, even\nCesar, little observing as he was, saw a change in the manner of the\nRagons which seemed to denote some remarkable event. The greeting of\nMadame Ragon was particularly impressive; her look and accent seemed to\nsay to Cesar, \"We are paid.\"\n\nAt the dessert, the notary of Sceaux appeared. Pillerault made him sit\ndown, and then looked at Cesar, who began to suspect a surprise, though\nhe was far indeed from imagining the extent of it.\n\n\"My nephew, the savings of your wife, your daughter, and yourself, for\nthe last eighteen months, amounted to twenty thousand francs. I have\nreceived thirty thousand by the dividend on my claim. We have therefore\nfifty thousand francs to divide among your creditors. Monsieur Ragon has\nreceived thirty thousand francs for his dividend, and you have now\npaid him the balance of his claim in full, interest included, for which\nmonsieur here, the notary of Sceaux, has brought you a receipt. The\nrest of the money is with Crottat, ready for Lourdois, Madame Madou, the\nmason, carpenter, and the other most pressing creditors. Next year, we\nmay do as well. With time and patience we can go far.\"\n\nBirotteau's joy is not to be described; he threw himself into his\nuncle's arms, weeping.\n\n\"May he not wear his cross?\" said Ragon to the Abbe Loraux.\n\nThe confessor fastened the red ribbon to Cesar's buttonhole. The poor\nclerk looked at himself again and again during the evening in the\nmirrors of the salon, manifesting a joy at which people thinking\nthemselves superior might have laughed, but which these good bourgeois\nthought quite natural.\n\nThe next day Birotteau went to find Madame Madou.\n\n\"Ah, there you are, good soul!\" she cried. \"I didn't recognize you, you\nhave turned so gray. Yet you don't really drudge, you people; you've got\ngood places. As for me, I work like a turnspit that deserves baptism.\"\n\n\"But, madame--\"\n\n\"Never mind, I don't mean it as a reproach,\" she said. \"You have got my\nreceipt.\"\n\n\"I came to tell you that I shall pay you to-morrow, at Monsieur\nCrottat's, the rest of your claim in full, with interest.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\"\n\n\"Be there at eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Hey! there's honor for you! good measure and running over!\" she cried\nwith naive admiration. \"Look here, my good monsieur, I am doing a fine\ntrade with your little red-head. He's a nice young fellow; he lets\nme earn a fair penny without haggling over it, so that I may get an\nequivalent for that loss. Well, I'll get you a receipt in full, anyhow;\nyou keep the money, my poor old man! La Madou may get in a fury, and she\ndoes scold; but she has got something here--\" she cried, thumping the\nmost voluminous mounds of flesh ever yet seen in the markets.\n\n\"No,\" said Birotteau, \"the law is plain. I wish to pay you in full.\"\n\n\"Then I won't deny you the pleasure,\" she said; \"and to-morrow I'll\ntrumpet your conduct through the markets. Ha! it's rare, rare!\"\n\nThe worthy man had much the same scene, with variations, at Lourdois the\nhouse painter's, father-in-law of Crottat. It was raining; Cesar left\nhis umbrella at the corner of the door. The prosperous painter, seeing\nthe water trickling into the room where he was breakfasting with his\nwife, was not tender.\n\n\"Come, what do you want, my poor Pere Birotteau?\" he said, in the hard\ntone which some people take to importunate beggars.\n\n\"Monsieur, has not your son-in-law told you--\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Lourdois, expecting some appeal.\n\n\"To be at his office this morning at half past eleven, and give me a\nreceipt for the payment of your claims in full, with interest?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's another thing! Sit down, Monsieur Birotteau, and eat a\nmouthful with us.\"\n\n\"Do us the pleasure to share our breakfast,\" said Madame Lourdois.\n\n\"You are doing well, then?\" asked the fat Lourdois.\n\n\"No, monsieur, I have lived from hand to mouth, that I might scrape up\nthis money; but I hope, in time, to repair the wrongs I have done to my\nneighbor.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the painter, swallowing a mouthful of _pate de foie gras_,\n\"you are truly a man of honor.\"\n\n\"What is Madame Birotteau doing?\" asked Madame Lourdois.\n\n\"She is keeping the books of Monsieur Anselme Popinot.\"\n\n\"Poor people!\" said Madame Lourdois, in a low voice to her husband.\n\n\"If you ever need me, my dear Monsieur Birotteau, come and see me,\" said\nLourdois. \"I might help--\"\n\n\"I do need you--at eleven o'clock to-day, monsieur,\" said Birotteau,\nretiring.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThis first result gave courage to the poor bankrupt, but not peace of\nmind. On the contrary, the thought of regaining his honor agitated his\nlife inordinately; he completely lost the natural color of his\ncheeks, his eyes grew sunken and dim, and his face hollow. When old\nacquaintances met him, in the morning at eight o'clock or in the evening\nat four, as he went to and from the Rue de l'Oratoire, wearing the\nsurtout coat he wore at the time of his fall, and which he husbanded as\na poor sub-lieutenant husbands his uniform,--his hair entirely white,\nhis face pale, his manner timid,--some few would stop him in spite of\nhimself; for his eye was alert to avoid those he knew as he crept along\nbeside the walls, like a thief.\n\n\"Your conduct is known, my friend,\" said one; \"everybody regrets the\nsternness with which you treat yourself, also your wife and daughter.\"\n\n\"Take a little more time,\" said others; \"the wounds of money do not\nkill.\"\n\n\"No, but the wounds of the soul do,\" the poor worn Cesar answered one\nday to his friend Matifat.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nAt the beginning of the year 1822, the Canal Saint-Martin was begun.\nLand in the Faubourg du Temple increased enormously in value. The canal\nwould cut through the property which du Tillet had bought of Cesar\nBirotteau. The company who obtained the right of building it agreed to\npay the banker an exorbitant sum, provided they could take possession\nwithin a given time. The lease Cesar had granted to Popinot, which\nwent with the sale to du Tillet, now hindered the transfer to the\ncanal company. The banker came to the Rue des Cinq-Diamants to see the\ndruggist. If du Tillet was indifferent to Popinot, it is very certain\nthat the lover of Cesarine felt an instinctive hatred for du Tillet.\nHe knew nothing of the theft and the infamous scheme of the prosperous\nbanker, but an inward voice cried to him, \"The man is an unpunished\nrascal.\" Popinot would never have transacted the smallest business with\nhim; du Tillet's very presence was odious to his feelings. Under the\npresent circumstances it was doubly so, for the banker was now enriched\nthrough the forced spoliation of his former master; the lands about the\nMadeleine, as well as those in the Faubourg du Temple, were beginning to\nrise in price, and to foreshadow the enormous value they were to reach\nin 1827. So that after du Tillet had explained the object of his visit,\nPopinot looked at him with concentrated wrath.\n\n\"I shall not refuse to give up my lease; but I demand sixty thousand\nfrancs for it, and I shall not take one farthing less.\"\n\n\"Sixty thousand francs!\" exclaimed du Tillet, making a movement to leave\nthe shop.\n\n\"I have fifteen years' lease still to run; it will, moreover, cost me\nthree thousand francs a year to get other buildings. Therefore, sixty\nthousand francs, or say no more about it,\" said Popinot, going to the\nback of the shop, where du Tillet followed him.\n\nThe discussion grew warm, Birotteau's name was mentioned; Madame Cesar\nheard it and came down, and saw du Tillet for the first time since the\nfamous ball. The banker was unable to restrain a gesture of surprise at\nthe change which had come over the beautiful woman; he lowered his eyes,\nshocked at the result of his own work.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Popinot to Madame Cesar, \"is going to make three\nhundred thousand francs out of _your_ land, and he refuses _us_ sixty\nthousand francs' indemnity for _our_ lease.\"\n\n\"That is three thousand francs a year,\" said du Tillet.\n\n\"Three--thousand--francs!\" said Madame Cesar, slowly, in a clear,\npenetrating voice.\n\nDu Tillet turned pale. Popinot looked at Madame Birotteau. There was a\nmoment of profound silence, which made the scene still more inexplicable\nto Anselme.\n\n\"Sign your relinquishment of the lease, which I have made Crottat draw\nup,\" said du Tillet, drawing a stamped paper from a side-pocket. \"I will\ngive you a cheque on the Bank of France for sixty thousand francs.\"\n\nPopinot looked at Madame Cesar without concealing his astonishment; he\nthought he was dreaming. While du Tillet was writing his cheque at a\nhigh desk, Madame Cesar disappeared and went upstairs. The druggist and\nthe banker exchanged papers. Du Tillet bowed coldly to Popinot, and went\naway.\n\n\"At last, in a few months,\" thought Popinot, as he watched du Tillet\ngoing towards the Rue des Lombards, where his cabriolet was waiting,\n\"thanks to this extraordinary affair, I shall have my Cesarine. My poor\nlittle wife shall not wear herself out any longer. A look from Madame\nCesar was enough! What secret is there between her and that brigand? The\nwhole thing is extraordinary.\"\n\nPopinot sent the cheque at once to the Bank, and went up to speak to\nMadame Birotteau; she was not in the counting-room, and had doubtless\ngone to her chamber. Anselme and Constance lived like mother-in-law and\nson-in-law when people in that relation suit each other; he therefore\nrushed up to Madame Cesar's appartement with the natural eagerness of a\nlover on the threshold of his happiness. The young man was prodigiously\nsurprised to find her, as he sprang like a cat into the room, reading\na letter from du Tillet, whose handwriting he recognized at a glance. A\nlighted candle, and the black and quivering phantoms of burned letters\nlying on the floor made him shudder, for his quick eyes caught the\nfollowing words in the letter which Constance held in her hand:--\n\n  \"I adore you! You know it well, angel of my life, and--\"\n\n\"What power have you over du Tillet that could force him to agree to\nsuch terms?\" he said with a convulsive laugh that came from repressed\nsuspicion.\n\n\"Do not let us speak of that,\" she said, showing great distress.\n\n\"No,\" said Popinot, bewildered; \"let us rather talk of the end of all\nyour troubles.\" Anselme turned on his heel towards the window, and\ndrummed with his fingers on the panes as he gazed into the court.\n\"Well,\" he said to himself, \"even if she did love du Tillet, is that any\nreason why I should not behave like an honorable man?\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" said the poor woman.\n\n\"The total of the net profits of Cephalic Oil mount up to two hundred\nand forty-two thousand francs; half of that is one hundred and\ntwenty-one thousand,\" said Popinot, brusquely. \"If I withdraw from\nthat amount the forty-eight thousand francs which I paid to Monsieur\nBirotteau, there remains seventy-three thousand, which, joined to these\nsixty thousand paid for the relinquishment of the lease, gives _you_ one\nhundred and thirty-three thousand francs.\"\n\nMadame Cesar listened with fluctuations of joy which made her tremble so\nviolently that Popinot could hear the beating of her heart.\n\n\"Well, I have always considered Monsieur Birotteau as my partner,\" he\nwent on; \"we can use this sum to pay his creditors in full. Add\nthe twenty-eight thousand you have saved and placed in our uncle\nPillerault's hands, and we have one hundred and sixty-one thousand\nfrancs. Our uncle will not refuse his receipt for his own claim of\ntwenty-five thousand. No human power can deprive me of the right of\nlending to my father-in-law, by anticipating our profits of next year,\nthe necessary sum to make up the total amount due to his creditor,\nand--he--will--be--reinstated--restored--\"\n\n\"Restored!\" cried Madame Cesar, falling on her knees beside a chair. She\njoined her hands and said a prayer; as she did so, the letter slid from\nher fingers. \"Dear Anselme,\" she said, crossing herself, \"dear son!\" She\ntook his head in her hands, kissed him on the forehead, pressed him to\nher heart, and seemed for a moment beside herself. \"Cesarine is thine!\nMy daughter will be happy at last. She can leave that shop where she is\nkilling herself--\"\n\n\"For love?\" said Popinot.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the mother, smiling.\n\n\"Listen to a little secret,\" said Popinot, glancing at the fatal letter\nfrom a corner of his eye. \"I helped Celestin to buy your business; but I\ndid it on one condition,--your appartement was to be kept exactly as you\nleft it. I had an idea in my head, though I never thought that chance\nwould favor it so much. Celestin is bound to sub-let to you your old\nappartement, where he has never set foot, and where all the furniture\nwill be yours. I have kept the second story, where I shall live with\nCesarine, who shall never leave you. After our marriage I shall come and\npass the days from eight in the morning till six in the evening here.\nI will buy out Monsieur Cesar's share in this business for a hundred\nthousand francs, and that will give you an income to live on. Shall you\nnot be happy?\"\n\n\"Tell me no more, Anselme, or I shall go out of my mind.\"\n\nThe angelic attitude of Madame Cesar, the purity of her eyes, the\ninnocence of her candid brow, contradicted so gloriously the thoughts\nwhich surged in the lover's brain that he resolved to make an end of\ntheir monstrosities forever. Sin was incompatible with the life and\nsentiments of such a woman.\n\n\"My dear, adored mother,\" said Anselme, \"in spite of myself, a horrible\nsuspicion has entered my soul. If you wish to see me happy, you will put\nan end to it at once.\"\n\nPopinot stretched out his hand and picked up the letter.\n\n\"Without intending it,\" he resumed, alarmed at the terror painted on\nConstance's face, \"I read the first words of this letter of du Tillet.\nThe words coincide in a singular manner with the power you have just\nshown in forcing that man to accept my absurd exactions; any man would\nexplain it as the devil explains it to me, in spite of myself. Your\nlook--three words suffice--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" said Madame Cesar, taking the letter and burning it. \"My son, I\nam severely punished for a trifling error. You shall know all, Anselme.\nI shall not allow a suspicion inspired by her mother to injure my\ndaughter; and besides, I can speak without blushing. What I now tell\nyou, I could tell my husband. Du Tillet wished to seduce me; I informed\nmy husband of it, and du Tillet was to have been dismissed. On the\nvery day my husband was about to send him away, he robbed us of three\nthousand francs.\"\n\n\"I was sure of it!\" said Popinot, expressing his hatred by the tones of\nhis voice.\n\n\"Anselme, your future, your happiness, demand this confidence; but\nyou must let it die in your heart, just as it is dead in mine and in\nCesar's. Do you not remember how my husband scolded us for an error in\nthe accounts? Monsieur Birotteau, to avoid a police-court which might\nhave destroyed the man for life, no doubt placed in the desk three\nthousand francs,--the price of that cashmere shawl which I did not\nreceive till three years later. All this explains the scene. Alas!\nmy dear child, I must admit my foolishness; du Tillet wrote me three\nlove-letters, which pictured him so well that I kept them,\" she said,\nlowering her eyes and sighing, \"as a curiosity. I have not re-read them\nmore than once; still, it was imprudent to keep them. When I saw du\nTillet just now I was reminded of them, and I came upstairs to burn\nthem; I was looking over the last as you came in. That's the whole\nstory, my friend.\"\n\nAnselme knelt for a moment beside her and kissed her hand with an\nunspeakable emotion, which brought tears into the eyes of both; Madame\nCesar raised him, stretched out her arms and pressed him to her heart.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThis day was destined to be a day of joy to Cesar. The private secretary\nof the king, Monsieur de Vandenesse, called at the Sinking-Fund Office\nto find him. They walked out together into the little courtyard.\n\n\"Monsieur Birotteau,\" said the Vicomte de Vandenesse, \"your efforts to\npay your creditors in full have accidentally become known to the king.\nHis Majesty, touched by such rare conduct, and hearing that through\nhumility you no longer wear the cross of the Legion of honor, has sent\nme to command you to put it on again. Moreover, wishing to help you in\nmeeting your obligations, he has charged me to give you this sum from\nhis privy purse, regretting that he is unable to make it larger. Let\nthis be a profound secret. His Majesty thinks it derogatory to the royal\ndignity to have his good deeds divulged,\" said the private secretary,\nputting six thousand francs into the hand of the poor clerk, who\nlistened to this speech with unutterable emotion. The words that came to\nhis lips were disconnected and stammering. Vandenesse waved his hand to\nhim, smiling, and went away.\n\nThe principle which actuated poor Cesar is so rare in Paris that his\nconduct by degrees attracted admiration. Joseph Lebas, Popinot the\njudge, Camusot, the Abbe Loraux, Ragon, the head of the important house\nwhere Cesarine was employed, Lourdois, Monsieur de la Billardiere, and\nothers, talked of it. Public opinion, undergoing a change, now lauded\nhim to the skies.\n\n\"He is indeed a man of honor!\" The phrase even sounded in Cesar's ears\nas he passed along the streets, and caused him the emotion an author\nfeels when he hears the muttered words: \"That is he!\" This noble\nrecovery of credit enraged du Tillet. Cesar's first thought on receiving\nthe bank-notes sent by the king was to use them in paying the debt still\ndue to his former clerk. The worthy man went to the Rue de la Chaussee\nd'Antin just as the banker was returning from the Bourse; they met upon\nthe stairway.\n\n\"Well, my poor Birotteau!\" said du Tillet, with a stealthy glance.\n\n\"Poor!\" exclaimed the debtor proudly, \"I am very rich. I shall lay my\nhead this night upon my pillow with the happiness of knowing that I have\npaid you in full.\"\n\nThis speech, ringing with integrity, sent a sharp pang through du\nTillet. In spite of the esteem he publicly enjoyed, he did not esteem\nhimself; an inextinguishable voice cried aloud within his soul, \"The man\nis sublime!\"\n\n\"Pay me?\" he said; \"why, what business are you doing?\"\n\nFeeling sure that du Tillet would not repeat what he told him, Birotteau\nanswered: \"I shall never go back to business, monsieur. No human power\ncould have foreseen what has happened to me there. Who knows that I\nmight not be the victim of another Roguin? But my conduct has been\nplaced under the eyes of the king; his heart has deigned to sympathize\nwith my efforts; he has encouraged them by sending me a sum of money\nlarge enough to--\"\n\n\"Do you want a receipt?\" said du Tillet, interrupting him; \"are you\ngoing to pay--\"\n\n\"In full, with interest. I must ask you to come with me now to Monsieur\nCrottat, only two steps from here.\"\n\n\"Before a notary?\"\n\n\"Monsieur; I am not forbidden to aim at my complete reinstatement; to\nobtain it, all deeds and receipts must be legal and undeniable.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said du Tillet, going out with Birotteau; \"it is only a\nstep. But where did you take all that money from?\"\n\n\"I have not taken it,\" said Cesar; \"I have earned it by the sweat of my\nbrow.\"\n\n\"You owe an enormous sum to Claparon.\"\n\n\"Alas! yes; that is my largest debt. I think sometimes I shall die\nbefore I pay it.\"\n\n\"You never can pay it,\" said du Tillet harshly.\n\n\"He is right,\" thought Birotteau.\n\nAs he went home the poor man passed, inadvertently, along the Rue\nSaint-Honore; for he was in the habit of making a circuit to avoid\nseeing his shop and the windows of his former home. For the first time\nsince his fall he saw the house where eighteen years of happiness had\nbeen effaced by the anguish of three months.\n\n\"I hoped to end my days there,\" he thought; and he hastened his steps,\nfor he caught sight of the new sign,--\n\n\n                           CELESTIN CREVEL\n\n                     Successor to Cesar Birotteau\n\n\n\"Am I dazzled, am I going blind? Was that Cesarine?\" he cried,\nrecollecting a blond head he had seen at the window.\n\nHe had actually seen his daughter, his wife, and Popinot. The lovers\nknew that Birotteau never passed before the windows of his old home, and\nthey had come to the house to make arrangements for a fete which they\nintended to give him. This amazing apparition so astonished Birotteau\nthat he stood stock-still, unable to move.\n\n\"There is Monsieur Birotteau looking at his old house,\" said Monsieur\nMolineux to the owner of a shop opposite to \"The Queen of Roses.\"\n\n\"Poor man!\" said the perfumer's former neighbor; \"he gave a fine\nball--two hundred carriages in the street.\"\n\n\"I was there; and he failed in three months,\" said Molineux. \"I was the\nassignee.\"\n\nBirotteau fled, trembling in every limb, and hastened back to\nPillerault.\n\nPillerault, who had just been informed of what had happened in the Rue\ndes Cinq-Diamants, feared that his nephew was scarcely fit to bear the\nshock of joy which the sudden knowledge of his restoration would cause\nhim; for Pillerault was a daily witness of the moral struggles of the\npoor man, whose mind stood always face to face with his inflexible\ndoctrines against bankruptcy, and whose vital forces were used and spent\nat every hour. Honor was to Cesar a corpse, for which an Easter morning\nmight yet dawn. This hope kept his sorrow incessantly active. Pillerault\ntook upon himself the duty of preparing his nephew to receive the good\nnews; and when Birotteau came in he was thinking over the best means\nof accomplishing his purpose. Cesar's joy as he related the proof of\ninterest which the king had bestowed upon him seemed of good augury, and\nthe astonishment he expressed at seeing Cesarine at \"The Queen of Roses\"\nafforded, Pillerault thought, an excellent opening.\n\n\"Well, Cesar,\" said the old man, \"do you know what is at the bottom\nof it?--the hurry Popinot is in to marry Cesarine. He cannot wait any\nlonger; and you ought not, for the sake of your exaggerated ideas of\nhonor, to make him pass his youth eating dry bread with the fumes of\na good dinner under his nose. Popinot wishes to lend you the amount\nnecessary to pay your creditors in full.\"\n\n\"Then he would buy his wife,\" said Birotteau.\n\n\"Is it not honorable to reinstate his father-in-law?\"\n\n\"There would be ground for contention; besides--\"\n\n\"Besides,\" exclaimed Pillerault, pretending anger, \"you may have the\nright to immolate yourself if you choose, but you have no right to\nimmolate your daughter.\"\n\nA vehement discussion ensued, which Pillerault designedly excited.\n\n\"Hey! if Popinot lent you nothing,\" cried Pillerault, \"if he had called\nyou his partner, if he had considered the price which he paid to the\ncreditors for your share in the Oil as an advance upon the profits, so\nas not to strip you of everything--\"\n\n\"I should have seemed to rob my creditors in collusion with him.\"\n\nPillerault feigned to be defeated by this argument. He knew the human\nheart well enough to be certain that during the night Cesar would go\nover the question in his own mind, and the mental discussion would\naccustom him to the idea of his complete vindication.\n\n\"But how came my wife and daughter to be in our old appartement?\" asked\nBirotteau, while they were dining.\n\n\"Anselme wants to hire it, and live there with Cesarine. Your wife is\non his side. They have had the banns published without saying anything\nabout it, so as to force you to consent. Popinot says there will be much\nless merit in marrying Cesarine after you are reinstated. You take six\nthousand francs from the king, and you won't accept anything from your\nrelations! I can well afford to give you a receipt in full for all that\nis owing to me; do you mean to refuse it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cesar; \"but that won't keep me from saving up everything to\npay you.\"\n\n\"Irrational folly!\" cried Pillerault. \"In matters of honor I ought to\nbe believed. What nonsense were you saying just now? How have you robbed\nyour creditors when you have paid them all in full?\"\n\nCesar looked earnestly at Pillerault, and Pillerault was touched to see,\nfor the first time in three years, a genuine smile on the face of his\npoor nephew.\n\n\"It is true,\" he said, \"they would be paid; but it would be selling my\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"And I wish to be bought!\" cried Cesarine, entering with Popinot.\n\nThe lovers had heard Birotteau's last words as they came on tiptoe\nthrough the antechamber of their uncle's little appartement, Madame\nBirotteau following. All three had driven round to the creditors who\nwere still unpaid, requesting them to meet at Alexandre Crottat's that\nevening to receive their money. The all-powerful logic of the enamored\nPopinot triumphed in the end over Cesar's scruples, though he persisted\nfor some time in calling himself a debtor, and in declaring that he\nwas circumventing the law by a substitution. But the refinements of his\nconscience gave way when Popinot cried out: \"Do you want to kill your\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"Kill my daughter!\" said Cesar, thunderstruck.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Popinot, \"I have the right to convey to you the sum\nwhich I conscientiously believe to be your share in my profits. Do you\nrefuse it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cesar.\n\n\"Very good; then let us go at once to Crottat and settle the matter,\nso that there may be no backing out of it. We will arrange about our\nmarriage contract at the same time.\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nA petition for reinstatement with corroborative documents was at once\ndeposited by Derville at the office of the _procureur-general_ of the\nCour Royale.\n\nDuring the month required for the legal formalities and for the\npublication of the banns of marriage between Cesarine and Anselme,\nBirotteau was a prey to feverish agitation. He was restless. He\nfeared he should not live till the great day when the decree for his\nvindication would be rendered. His heart throbbed, he said, without\ncause. He complained of dull pains in that organ, worn out as it was\nby emotions of sorrow, and now wearied with the rush of excessive joy.\nDecrees of rehabilitation are so rare in the bankrupt court of Paris\nthat seldom more than one is granted in ten years.\n\nTo those persons who take society in its serious aspects, the\nparaphernalia of justice has a grand and solemn character difficult\nperhaps to define. Institutions depend altogether on the feelings with\nwhich men view them and the degree of grandeur which men's thoughts\nattach to them. When there is no longer, we will not say religion,\nbut belief among the people, whenever early education has loosened all\nconservative bonds by accustoming youth to the practice of pitiless\nanalysis, a nation will be found in process of dissolution; for it will\nthen be held together only by the base solder of material interests, and\nby the formulas of a creed created by intelligent egotism.\n\nBred in religious ideas, Birotteau held justice to be what it ought to\nbe in the eyes of men,--a representation of society itself, an august\nutterance of the will of all, apart from the particular form by which it\nis expressed. The older, feebler, grayer the magistrate, the more solemn\nseemed the exercise of his function,--a function which demands profound\nstudy of men and things, which subdues the heart and hardens it against\nthe influence of eager interests. It is a rare thing nowadays to find\nmen who mount the stairway of the old Palais de Justice in the grasp of\nkeen emotions. Cesar Birotteau was one of those men.\n\nFew persons have noticed the majestic solemnity of that stairway,\nadmirably placed as it is to produce a solemn effect. It rises, beyond\nthe outer peristyle which adorns the courtyard of the Palais, from the\ncentre of a gallery leading, at one end, to the vast hall of the Pas\nPerdus, and at the other to the Sainte-Chapelle,--two architectural\nmonuments which make all buildings in their neighborhood seem paltry.\nThe church of Saint-Louis is among the most imposing edifices in Paris,\nand the approach to it through this long gallery is at once sombre and\nromantic. The great hall of the Pas Perdus, on the contrary, presents at\nthe other end of the gallery a broad space of light; it is impossible to\nforget that the history of France is linked to those walls. The stairway\nshould therefore be imposing in character; and, in point of act, it is\nneither dwarfed nor crushed by the architectural splendors on either\nside of it. Possibly the mind is sobered by a glimpse, caught through\nthe rich gratings, of the Place du Palais-de-Justice, where so many\nsentences have been executed. The staircase opens above into an enormous\nspace, or antechamber, leading to the hall where the Court holds its\npublic sittings.\n\nImagine the emotions with which the bankrupt, susceptible by nature\nto the awe of such accessories, went up that stairway to the hall of\njudgment, surrounded by his nearest friends,--Lebas, president of the\nCourt of Commerce, Camusot his former judge, Ragon, and Monsieur l'Abbe\nLoraux his confessor. The pious priest made the splendors of human\njustice stand forth in strong relief by reflections which gave them\nstill greater solemnity in Cesar's eyes. Pillerault, the practical\nphilosopher, fearing the danger of unexpected events on the worn mind of\nhis nephew, had schemed to prepare him by degrees for the joys of this\nfestal day. Just as Cesar finished dressing, a number of his faithful\nfriends arrived, all eager for the honor of accompanying him to the bar\nof the Court. The presence of this retinue roused the honest man to an\nelation which gave him strength to meet the imposing spectacle in the\nhalls of justice. Birotteau found more friends awaiting him in the\nsolemn audience chamber, where about a dozen members of the council were\nin session.\n\nAfter the cases were called over, Birotteau's attorney made his demand\nfor reinstatement in the usual terms. On a sign from the presiding\njudge, the _procureur-general_ rose. In the name of his office this\npublic prosecutor, the representative of public vindictiveness, asked\nthat honor might be restored to the merchant who had never really lost\nit,--a solitary instance of such an appeal; for a condemned man can\nonly be pardoned. Men of honor alone can imagine the emotions of Cesar\nBirotteau as he heard Monsieur de Grandville pronounce a speech, of\nwhich the following is an abridgement:--\n\n  \"Gentlemen,\" said that celebrated official, \"on the 16th of\n  January, 1820, Birotteau was declared a bankrupt by the commercial\n  tribunal of the Seine. His failure was not caused by imprudence,\n  nor by rash speculations, nor by any act that stained his honor.\n  We desire to say publicly that this failure was the result of a\n  disaster which has again and again occurred, to the detriment of\n  justice and the great injury of the city of Paris. It has been\n  reserved for our generation, in which the bitter leaven of\n  republican principles and manners will long be felt, to behold the\n  notariat of Paris abandoning the glorious traditions of preceding\n  centuries, and producing in a few years as many failures as two\n  centuries of the old monarchy had produced. The thirst for gold\n  rapidly acquired has beset even these officers of trust, these\n  guardians of the public wealth, these mediators between the law\n  and the people!\"\n\nOn this text followed an allocution, in which the Comte de Grandville,\nobedient to the necessities of his role, contrived to incriminate\nthe Liberals, the Bonapartists, and all other enemies of the throne.\nSubsequent events have proved that he had reason for his apprehension.\n\n  \"The flight of a notary of Paris who carried off the funds which\n  Birotteau had deposited in his hands, caused the fall of your\n  petitioner,\" he resumed. \"The Court rendered in that matter a\n  decree which showed to what extent the confidence of Roguin's\n  clients had been betrayed. A _concordat_ was held. For the honor\n  of your petitioner, we call attention to the fact that his\n  proceedings were remarkable for a purity not found in any of the\n  scandalous failures which daily degrade the commerce of Paris. The\n  creditors of Birotteau received the whole property, down to the\n  smallest articles that the unfortunate man possessed. They\n  received, gentlemen, his clothes, his jewels, things of purely\n  personal use,--and not only his, but those of his wife, who\n  abandoned all her rights to swell the total of his assets. Under\n  these circumstances Birotteau showed himself worthy of the respect\n  which his municipal functions had already acquired for him; for he\n  was at the time a deputy-mayor of the second arrondissement and\n  had just received the decoration of the Legion of honor, granted\n  as much for his devotion to the royal cause in Vendemiaire, on the\n  steps of the Saint-Roch, which were stained with his blood, as for\n  his conciliating spirit, his estimable qualities as a magistrate,\n  and the modesty with which he declined the honors of the\n  mayoralty, pointing out one more worthy of them, the Baron de la\n  Billardiere, one of those noble Vendeens whom he had learned to\n  value in the dark days.\"\n\n\"That phrase is better than mine,\" whispered Cesar to Pillerault.\n\n  \"At that time the creditors, who received sixty per cent of their\n  claims through the aforesaid relinquishment on the part of this\n  loyal merchant, his wife, and his daughter of all that they\n  possessed, recorded their respect for their debtor in the\n  certificate of bankruptcy granted at the _concordat_ which then\n  took place, giving him at the same time a release from the\n  remainder of their claims. This testimonial is couched in terms\n  which are worthy of the attention of the Court.\"\n\nHere the _procureur-general_ read the passage from the certificate of\nbankruptcy.\n\n  \"After receiving such expressions of good-will, gentlemen, most\n  merchants would have considered themselves released from\n  obligation and free to return boldly into the vortex of business.\n  Far from so doing, Birotteau, without allowing himself to be cast\n  down, resolved within his conscience to toil for the glorious day\n  which has at length dawned for him here. Nothing disheartened him.\n  Our beloved sovereign granted to the man who shed his blood on the\n  steps of Saint-Roch an office where he might earn his bread. The\n  salary of that office the bankrupt laid by for his creditors,\n  taking nothing for his own wants; for family devotion has\n  supported him.\"\n\nBirotteau pressed his uncle's hand, weeping.\n\n  \"His wife and his daughter poured their earnings into the common\n  fund, for they too espoused the noble hope of Birotteau. Each came\n  down from the position she had held and took an inferior one.\n  These sacrifices, gentlemen, should be held in honor, for they are\n  harder than all others to bear. I will now show you what sort of\n  task it was that Birotteau imposed upon himself.\"\n\nHere the _procureur-general_ read a summing-up of the schedule, giving\nthe amounts which had remained unpaid and the names of the creditors.\n\n  \"Each of these sums, with the interest thereon, has been paid,\n  gentlemen; and the payment is not shown by receipts under private\n  seal, which might be questioned: they are payments made before a\n  notary, properly authenticated; and according to the inflexible\n  requirements of this Court they have been examined and verified by\n  the proper authority. We now ask you to restore Birotteau, not to\n  honor, but to all the rights of which he was deprived. In doing\n  this you are doing justice. Such exhibitions of character are so\n  rare in this Court that we cannot refrain from testifying to the\n  petitioner how heartily we applaud his conduct, which an august\n  approval has already privately encouraged.\"\n\nThe prosecuting officer closed by reading his charge in the customary\nformal terms.\n\nThe Court deliberated without retiring, and the president rose to\npronounce judgement.\n\n  \"The Court,\" he said, in closing, \"desires me to express to\n  Birotteau the satisfaction with which it renders such a judgment.\n  Clerk, call the next case.\"\n\nBirotteau, clothed with the caftan of honor which the speech of the\nillustrious _procureur-general_ had cast about him, stood dumb with joy\nas he listened to the solemn words of the president, which betrayed the\nquiverings of a heart beneath the impassibility of human justice. He was\nunable to stir from his place before the bar, and seemed for a moment\nnailed there, gazing at the judges with a wondering air, as though they\nwere angels opening to him the gates of social life. His uncle took him\nby the arm and led him from the hall. Cesar had not as yet obeyed the\ncommand of Louis XVIII., but he now mechanically fastened the ribbon of\nthe Legion of honor to his button-hole. In a moment he was surrounded by\nhis friends and borne in triumph down the great stairway to his coach.\n\n\"Where are you taking me, my friends?\" he said to Joseph Lebas,\nPillerault, and Ragon.\n\n\"To your own home.\"\n\n\"No; it is only three o'clock. I wish to go to the Bourse, and use my\nrights.\"\n\n\"To the Bourse!\" said Pillerault to the coachman, making an expressive\nsign to Joseph Lebas, for he saw symptoms in Cesar which led him to fear\nhe might lose his mind.\n\nThe late perfumer re-entered the Bourse leaning on the arms of the\ntwo honored merchants, his uncle and Joseph Lebas. The news of his\nrehabilitation had preceded him. The first person who saw them enter,\nfollowed by Ragon, was du Tillet.\n\n\"Ah! my dear master,\" he cried, \"I am delighted that you have pulled\nthrough. I have perhaps contributed to this happy ending of your\ntroubles by letting that little Popinot drag a feather from my wing. I\nam as glad of your happiness as if it were my own.\"\n\n\"You could not be otherwise,\" said Pillerault. \"Such a thing can never\nhappen to you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said du Tillet.\n\n\"Oh! all in good part,\" said Lebas, smiling at the malicious meaning of\nPillerault, who, without knowing the real truth, considered the man a\nscoundrel.\n\nMatifat caught sight of Cesar, and immediately the most noted merchants\nsurrounded him and gave him an _ovation boursiere_. He was overwhelmed\nwith flattering compliments and grasped by the hand, which roused some\njealousy and caused some remorse; for out of every hundred persons\nwalking about that hall fifty at least had \"liquidated\" their affairs.\nGigonnet and Gobseck, who were talking together in a corner, looked at\nthe man of commercial honor very much as a naturalist must have looked\nat the first electric-eel that was ever brought to him,--a fish armed\nwith the power of a Leyden jar, which is the greatest curiosity of the\nanimal kingdom. After inhaling the incense of his triumph, Cesar got\ninto the coach to go to his own home, where the marriage contract of\nhis dear Cesarine and the devoted Popinot was ready for signature. His\nnervous laugh disturbed the minds of the three old friends.\n\nIt is a fault of youth to think the whole world vigorous with its own\nvigor,--a fault derived from its virtues. Youth sees neither men nor\nthings through spectacles; it colors all with the reflex glory of its\nardent fires, and casts the superabundance of its own life upon the\naged. Like Cesar and like Constance, Popinot held in his memory a\nglowing recollection of the famous ball. Constance and Cesar through\ntheir years of trial had often, though they never spoke of it to each\nother, heard the strains of Collinet's orchestra, often beheld\nthat festive company, and tasted the joys so swiftly and so cruelly\nchastised,--as Adam and Eve must have tasted in after times the\nforbidden fruit which gave both death and life to all posterity; for it\nappears that the generation of angels is a mystery of the skies.\n\nPopinot, however, could dream of the fete without remorse, nay, with\necstasy. Had not Cesarine in all her glory then promised herself to\nhim--to him, poor? During that evening had he not won the assurance\nthat he was loved for himself alone? So when he bought the appartement\nrestored by Grindot, from Celestin, when he stipulated that all should\nbe kept intact, when he religiously preserved the smallest things that\nonce belonged to Cesar and to Constance, he was dreaming of another\nball,--his ball, his wedding-ball! He made loving preparation for\nit, imitating his old master in necessary expenses, but eschewing all\nfollies,--follies that were now past and done with. So the dinner was\nto be served by Chevet; the guests were to be mostly the same: the Abbe\nLoraux replaced the chancellor of the Legion of honor; the president of\nthe Court of Commerce, Monsieur Lebas, had promised to be there; Popinot\ninvited Monsieur Camusot in acknowledgment of the kindness he had\nbestowed upon Birotteau; Monsieur de Vandenesse and Monsieur de Fontaine\ntook the place of Roguin and his wife. Cesarine and Popinot distributed\ntheir invitations with much discretion. Both dreaded the publicity of\na wedding, and they escaped the jar such scenes must cause to pure and\ntender hearts by giving the ball on the evening of the day appointed for\nsigning the marriage-contract.\n\nConstance found in her room the gown of cherry velvet in which she had\nshone for a single night with fleeting splendor. Cesarine cherished\na dream of appearing before Popinot in the identical ball-dress about\nwhich, time and time again, he had talked to her. The appartement was\nmade ready to present to Cesar's eyes the same enchanting scene he had\nonce enjoyed for a single evening. Neither Constance, nor Cesarine, nor\nPopinot perceived the danger to Cesar in this sudden and overwhelming\nsurprise, and they awaited his arrival at four o'clock with a delight\nthat was almost childish.\n\nFollowing close upon the unspeakable emotion his re-entrance at the\nBourse had caused him, the hero of commercial honor was now to meet the\nsudden shock of felicity that awaited him in his old home. He entered\nthe house, and saw at the foot of the staircase (still new as he had\nleft it) his wife in her velvet robe, Cesarine, the Comte de Fontaine,\nthe Vicomte de Vandenesse, the Baron de la Billardiere, the illustrious\nVauquelin. A light film dimmed his eyes, and his uncle Pillerault, who\nheld his arm, felt him shudder inwardly.\n\n\"It is too much,\" said the philosopher to the happy lover; \"he can never\ncarry all the wine you are pouring out to him.\"\n\nJoy was so vivid in their hearts that each attributed Cesar's\nemotion and his stumbling step to the natural intoxication of his\nfeelings,--natural, but sometimes mortal. When he found himself once\nmore in his own home, when he saw his salon, his guests, the women in\ntheir ball-dresses, suddenly the heroic measure in the finale of the\ngreat symphony rang forth in his head and heart. Beethoven's ideal\nmusic echoed, vibrated, in many tones, sounding its clarions through the\nmembranes of the weary brain, of which it was indeed the grand finale.\n\nOppressed with this inward harmony, Cesar took the arm of his wife\nand whispered, in a voice suffocated by a rush of blood that was still\nrepressed: \"I am not well.\"\n\nConstance, alarmed, led him to her bedroom; he reached it with\ndifficulty, and fell into a chair, saying: \"Monsieur Haudry, Monsieur\nLoraux.\"\n\nThe Abbe Loraux came, followed by the guests and the women in their\nball-dresses, who stopped short, a frightened group. In presence of that\nshining company Cesar pressed the hand of his confessor and laid his\nhead upon the bosom of his kneeling wife. A vessel had broken in his\nheart, and the rush of blood strangled his last sigh.\n\n\"Behold the death of the righteous!\" said the Abbe Loraux solemnly,\npointing to Cesar with the divine gesture which Rembrandt gave to Christ\nin his picture of the Raising of Lazarus.\n\nJesus commanded the earth to give up its prey; the priest called heaven\nto behold a martyr of commercial honor worthy to receive the everlasting\npalm.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Bianchon, Horace\n       Father Goriot\n       The Atheist's Mass\n       The Commission in Lunacy\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n       The Government Clerks\n       Pierrette\n       A Study of Woman\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       Honorine\n       The Seamy Side of History\n       The Magic Skin\n       A Second Home\n       A Prince of Bohemia\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       The Muse of the Department\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Country Parson\n     In addition, M.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1346,"split":"test"}
