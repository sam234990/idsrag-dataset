{"ori_id":"a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee","title":"Arsenic and Old Lace (film)","context":"Arsenic and Old Lace (film)\n The plot revolves around the Brewster family of Brooklyn, New York, descended from the Mayflower and composed of illustrious White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ancestors whose portraits line the walls. The religious theme is repeatedly mentioned, and Elaine is the daughter of the minister who lives next door, with some scenes held in its ancient cemetery. Today the Brewster clan comprises insane murderers.\nDespite having written several books ridiculing marriage as an \"old-fashioned superstition\", Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) falls in love with Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), who grew up next door to him in Brooklyn, and, on Halloween day, they marry. Immediately after the wedding, Mortimer visits the eccentric but lovable relatives who raised him and who still live in his old family home: his elderly aunts Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair), and his brother Teddy (John Alexander), who believes he is Theodore Roosevelt. Each time Teddy goes upstairs, he yells \"Charge!\" and takes the stairs at a run, imitating Roosevelt's famous charge up San Juan Hill.\nMortimer finds a corpse hidden in a window seat and assumes that Teddy has committed murder under some delusion, but his aunts explain that they are responsible (\"It's one of our charities\"). They explain in the most innocent terms that they have developed what Mortimer calls the \"very bad habit\" of ending the presumed suffering of lonely old bachelors by serving them elderberry wine spiked with arsenic, strychnine and \"just a pinch of cyanide\". The bodies are buried in the basement by Teddy, who believes he is digging locks for the Panama Canal and burying yellow fever victims.\nTo complicate matters further, Mortimer's brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) arrives with his alcoholic accomplice, plastic surgeon Dr. Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre). Jonathan is a murderer trying to escape the police and find a place to dispose of the corpse of his latest victim, a certain Mr. Spenalzo. Jonathan's face, as altered by Einstein while drunk, looks like Boris Karloff's in his makeup as Frankenstein's monster. This resemblance  is frequently noted, much to Jonathan's annoyance. Jonathan, upon finding out his aunts' secret, decides to bury Spenalzo in the cellar (to which Abby and Martha object vehemently, because their victims were all nice gentlemen while Mr. Spenalzo is a stranger and a \"foreigner\") and soon declares his intention to kill Mortimer.\nWhile Elaine waits at her family home next door for Mortimer to take her on their honeymoon, Mortimer makes increasingly frantic attempts to stay on top of the situation, including multiple efforts to alert the bumbling local cops to the threat Jonathan poses, as well as to get the paperwork filed that will have Teddy declared legally insane and committed to a mental asylum (giving him a safe explanation for the bodies should the cops find them, and preventing his aunts from creating any more victims because they will no longer have any place to bury the bodies). He also worries that he will go insane like the rest of the Brewster family. As he puts it, \"Insanity runs in my family, practically gallops!\" While explaining this to Elaine, he claims they've been crazy since the first Brewsters came to America as pilgrims.\nBut eventually Jonathan is arrested, while Teddy is safely consigned to an asylum and the two aunts insist upon joining him. Finally, Abby and Martha inform Mortimer that he is not biologically related to the Brewsters after all: his real mother was the aunts' cook and his father had been a chef on a steamship. If he is not an upper-class Brewster then he realizes he will not become insane or a murderer. In the film's closing scene, after lustily kissing Elaine and before whisking her away to their honeymoon, he gleefully exclaims \"I'm not a Brewster, I'm a son of a sea cook!\"\n<html>\n<head><title>Arsenic and Old Lace Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Arsenic and Old Lace script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Arsenic and Old Lace script, Arsenic and Old Lace movie script, Arsenic and Old Lace film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

You're out !\n\n   The batter, who missed the ball, drops his bat on the ground and\n   comes back to the Umpire. He tears the Umpire helmet and mask\n   away, and gives him a good punch in the nose. The Umpire falls on\n   the ground. The catcher then hits the batter. The Umpire rises\n   slowly from the ground.\n\n   Several very quick sequences : The ball-thrower drops his glove\n   and runs to the fight. Then several excited spectators stand up to\n   join the fight. Several player, who were waiting for their turn to\n   go on the field, also run to the fight. Then a view of the fight,\n   where all the players are hitting each other. Then the popcorn\n   seller, dropping his basket to join the fight. Then spectators\n   jumping over the balustrades to join the fight. Then another view\n   of the players fighting.

He\nturns around and notices the two journalists looking at him. He\nraises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face. The\ngirl in front of him turns around to look at him. She has blonde\ncurly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather. She is\nElaine Harper. With both his hands, Mortimer turns her face back\ntoward the counter.\n\nBack to the two journalists at the door of the room.\n\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\n<\/b>       Now what's he hiding from ?\n\nHe starts moving to get a better look at Mortimer.\nMortimer moves in front of Elaine, who smiles.\n\nThe two journalists are now in the room, and they look at\nMortimer.\n\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\n<\/b>       Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?\n\n<b>       THE PHOTOGRAPHER\n<\/b>       Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ?\n\nMortimer looks very embarrassed.\n\nBack to the two journalists.\n\n\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\n<\/b>       No, it's not him.

He\nknocks his head on the bar above the gate. He straightens his hat,\nand brings his face close to the clerk's one.

The older one,\nSargent Brophy, is talking to the younger one, Officer Patrick\nO'Hara.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't seem to realize. I'm\n       turning over to you the nicest, the best beat in Brooklyn.\n       Now look at that old church.

They're\n       like... they're like pressed rose leaves.\nThey have come near a police call box. Brophy takes a key out of\nhis pocket to open the box\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Pressed rose leaves ?\n\nIn front of the house, there is a \u00abRoom for Rent\u00bb sign. While\nBrophy picks up the phone in the call box, O'Hara looks at the\nsign.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       The old girls must be kind of hard up, huh ?\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       No, no.

But you can bet if anybody came\n       looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good\n       meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets.\n       That's just their way of digging up people to do good to.\n\nWe get a closer view of the front of the house. A large\nrectangular stone, with \u00abBrewster\u00bb engraved on it. A group of\nchildren runs in front of the house.\n\n<b>BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>\nIn the forefront of the room, Teddy Brewster is playing Mozart's\nTurkish March on the harpsichord. He looks a bit like late\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt. And he is dressed like the President\nwas dressed on the official pictures we've got of him... And, like\nthe President, he is wearing a pince-nez.\n\nIn another corner of the room, Abby Brewster is having tea with\nReverend Harper, Elaine's father. She looks like an old English\nlady, a bit like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.\n\n<b>       ABBY\n<\/b>       Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer\n       just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter\n       to the theater every night.\n\n<b>       REVEREND HARPER\n<\/b>       It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic,\n       but no man, no man with this published attitude on\n       marriage...\n\nClose-up on the book Reverend Harper just took on the table :\n\u00abMarriage, a Fraud and a Failure, by Mortimer Brewster\u00bb.\n<b>       REVEREND HARPER\n<\/b>       ...should take any man's daughter anyplace...\n\nHe sneezes.\n\n<b>       REVEREND HARPER\n<\/b>       ...at any time.\n\nHe sneezes again, louder this time.

The minute hand of the clock falls down to the\nhalf-hour position. O'Hara is very disturbed and points his stick\nto his Sargent, who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and\nlaughs with Reverend Harper and Abby.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the\n       station.

O'Hara jumps and drops the box with\nthe toys on the floor. Reverend Harper and Brophy seem to be less\nmoved by the event.\n\nBrophy stands back and points his finger up to Teddy.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Oh, Teddy, you promised me you wouldn't do that anymore.\n\nTeddy, still standing on the balcony, answers him leaning on the\nbalustrade.\n\n<b>       TEDDY\n<\/b>       But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of\n       those supplies.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Now don't do that again.

O'Hara jumps and looks at the clock.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       He used to do that in the middle of the night, and\n       neighbors raised Cain with me.

The room is completely dark.\n\nAbby climbs the stairs, reaches the balcony, and walks slowly pass\nJonathan, who is still standing at the same place. Then, she\nquickly enters the room she shares with her sister, who is holding\nthe door open for her.\n\nJonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to\nthe upper floor. He stops after a few steps, and sees the door of\nhis aunts' room opening slowly. Abby comes out.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Aunt Abby.\n\nAbby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door. Jonathan\nresumes his climbing.\nThe camera moves down into total black darkness, and then into the\nroom, where we see some light underneath the cellar door. We hear\nsteps, and the door opens to reveal Teddy, still in his colonial\ncostume, but without the helmet. He stops a few seconds, then\nstarts crossing the room, only lit by light coming from underneath\nthe kitchen door. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking, and\nwe guess Teddy has just opened it. Shuffling noises. Then we see\nthe shadow of Teddy carrying something apparently heavy. We hear\nthe cat screaming, and we guess Teddy must have stepped on its\ntail. When Teddy comes into the light from the open door of the\ncellar, we discover he is carrying a human body, which could only\nbe Mr. Hoskins' one taken from the window-seat. Teddy turns around\nand starts going backward down the steps to the cellar. He stops a\nfew seconds to close the door. Then we hear noises of something\nfalling, and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and\nfallen all the way down to the cellar.\n\nBlack screen during one second.\n\nEinstein is going down the staircase, lit only by a match he is\nholding in his hand.\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       He's all right, Johnny.\n\nWhen he gets on floor level, he meets Jonathan.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       But he's too heavy for me.\n\nHe burns his finger and blows the match. The scene becomes\ncompletely dark. We see only shadows.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and\n       pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ?\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around\n       outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the\n       window.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Yeah.\n\nJonathan moves to the front door, opens it, stops to look around,\nand then closes the door.\n\nEinstein walks slowly in the room.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       It's dark in here.\n\nHe bumps into something. We hear the lid of the window-seat\ncreaking several times.\nEinstein light another match, and we discover he has fallen into\nthe open window-seat, where he is now lying\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Where am I ? Oh, here I am.\n\nHe slowly gets out of the seat.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Who left this open ?\n\nJonathan taps on the window. Einstein blows the match and opens\nthe window.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Johnny ?\n\nWe see only shadows in the dark, but we guess Jonathan is handing\nMr. Spenalzo's corpse to Einstein, who will then put it in the\nwindow-seat.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Okay, Johnny, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him.\n       \u00abAllez !\u00bb Up ! Now, wait a minute, Johnny. You lost a leg\n       somewhere. Hey, help me. He's so heavy. Now I have him. Now\n       I got him.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Be careful.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Oh, but his shoe came off. Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy.\n       Now I've got him !\n\nKnocking at the door.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Hey, Johnny, somebody's at the door. Go open, quick.\n       I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick !\n\nSome more knocking. We hear the creaking of the lid of the window-\nseat, and we guess Einstein is closing it.\n\nThe front door opens slowly, and Elaine enters the house.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       Mortimer ! Aunt Abby !\n\nWe see the frightened face of Einstein.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       (voice over)\n       Aunt Martha !\n\nJonathan enters through the front door left open by Elaine, closes\nit and locks it.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       (looking frightened)\n       Who is it ? Is that you, Teddy ?\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Who are you ?\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       I'm Elaine Harper.

I mean, it's Brewster. I'm not very\n       used to it. I'm a brand-new Brewster.\n\nEinstein goes to the front door and switches the lights on.\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Doctor !\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       It's all right, Johnny. It's okay.\n\nEinstein has his little bottle in one hand, and, with the finger\nof the other hand, he tries to explain to Jonathan that the corpse\nis safely in the window-seat.\n\nJonathan looks at Einstein, and then goes across the room to look\naround. He even moves the drapes of a window to look outside.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       (voice over)\n       Maybe you'd better explain what you're doing here.\n\nJonathan keeps on checking around. He goes to the window above the\nwindow-seat, and looks outside.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       We happen to live here.\n\nHe spots an orphan shoe on the floor and picks it up.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       (voice over)\n       You don't live here. I've been in this house every day, and\n       I've never seen you before. Where are Miss Martha and Miss\n       Abby ? What have you done to them ?\n\nEinstein tries to explain to Jonathan, without using words, that\nthe shoe belongs to the corpse in the window-seat.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves. May I present\n       Doctor Einstein ?\nHe puts the shoe on the table, then lifts the tablecloth to look\nunderneath it.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       Doctor Einstein ?\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a\n       magician.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       Now I suppose you're gonna tell me that you're Boris...\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       (cutting her very harshly)\n       I am Jonathan Brewster.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       Oh !

Oh, that explains everything. Now that\n       I know who you are, I'll just be running along, if you'll\n       kindly unlock the door.\n\nThey move to the front door, beside which Einstein is standing,\nsmiling. Jonathan unlocks the door. He opens it a few inches, but\nstands in the way of Elaine, ready to got out.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       \u00abThat explains everything.\u00bb Just what do you mean by that ?\n       Why do you come here at this time of night ?\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       Well, I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up.

He has his helmet back on\nhis head and wears heavy working gloves.\n\n<b>       TEDDY\n<\/b>       No visitors. It's going to be a private funeral.\n\nHe crosses the room and starts climbing the stairs. Both Jonathan\nand Einstein are now holding Elaine.\n\n<b>       ELAINE\n<\/b>       Teddy !

But only for two seconds, because\nJonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind, and Einstein\nshoves the napkin in his open mouth.

Then, with the\nhelp of a knife, he puts all the napkin in Mortimer's mouth.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       You were right about that fellow.

He tries to explain\nby movements of his face that he would like to have his gag taken\noff.\n\nBehind O'Hara, Einstein starts mounting the stairs, and Jonathan\nstands up at the bottom of them.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Huh ? Oh, yes, sure.\n\nHe puts his hands to Mortimer's face to take off his gag.\n\nEinstein runs upstairs, followed by Jonathan.\n\nSuddenly, O'Hara removes his hands and smiles broadly.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Nooo ! You've got to hear the plot !\n\nHe takes his jacket off.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       My mother's sitting there, making up, see. And, like a\n       flash, suddenly, out of a clear sky, the door comes open\n       and a man with a black mustache comes in.\n\nOn the stairs behind O'Hara, Jonathan takes his jack-knife out of\nhis pocket and opens it.\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       He turns to my mother and he says, \u00abMiss Peaches La Tour,\n       will you marry me ?\u00bb That's the first scene. My mother\n       doesn't tell him they're married. That's the surprise !\n\nEinstein, who has seen the knife, tries to stop Jonathan. But\nJonathan keeps on walking slowly downstairs.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Oh, What a kick ! All right. Twenty-five years pass. Well,\n       in the meantime, there's me. Growing into a magnificent\n       specimen. So what do I do ? I join the police force and\n       become one of New York's finest. Well, I'm cleaning out a\n       crooked laundry, see ?\n\nClose-up on Jonathan's hand holding the knife, the blade of which\nis shining in the light.\n\nMortimer stares at the knife\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Little do I know it, but there is a dope fiend with a long\n       knife crawling after me. I'm in great danger. It's getting\n       you, ain't it ? I can see it in your eyes.\n\nActually, Mortimer's eyes are trying to attract O'Hara's attention\nto Jonathan, just behind him now.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Well, you ain't heard nothing yet.\n\nEinstein tries to stop Jonathan, but Jonathan pushes him away.\nEinstein takes off one of his shoes, and hits Jonathan very hard\non the head with it. Jonathan falls on the floor.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The\n       firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ?\n       Mayor Fiorello La Guardia !\n\nO'Hara turns around and sees Jonathan lying on the last steps of\nthe stairs.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       What's the matter with him ?\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       What ?\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       I personally, I like it very much.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       It's probably over his head, huh ?\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Yeah.\nO'Hara looks at Jonathan's face.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Where have I seen that face before ?\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       No, please.\n\nHe kneels beside Jonathan's body, and O'Hara returns to Mortimer.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm\n       walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a\n       guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following\n       me !\n\nKnocks at the door. O'Hara turns to Einstein.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       (to Einstein)\n       Don't let nobody in.\n       (to Mortimer)\n       I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the\n       corner.\n\nEinstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of\nthe front door. He rushes to Jonathan.\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Hey, Johnny, the cops !\n\nEinstein tries to wake up Jonathan, but doesn't succeed. He picks\nup his shoe and rushes upstairs.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I\n       pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I\n       says : \u00abCome in !\u00bb\n\nHe takes out his gun and points it at the door. Brophy and another\ncop, officer Saunders, come in. When they see O'Hara's gun\npointing at them, they raise their arms. O'Hara puts his gun back\nin his holster and welcomes his colleagues.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Oh, hello, boys.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       What the Sam Hill's going on here ?\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster.\n       He's going to help me write my play.\n\n<b>       SAUNDERS\n<\/b>       Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ?\n\nHe starts to untie Mortimer.\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       O'Hara, you better report in the station.

Shall we bring him\n       in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here.\n\nHe puts the phone down and turns to O'Hara, who has succeeded in\nwaking up Jonathan and getting him on his feet. Jonathan stares at\nBrophy. He thinks Brophy is talking about him.\n\nMortimer looks at his left hand, which has just been freed by\nSaunders.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       The Lieutenant is on his way over.\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       So I've been turned in, hey ?

I\n       suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the\n       reward.\n\nBrophy and O'Hara each take one arm of Jonathan.\n\n<b>       BROPHY & O'HARA\n<\/b>       Reward ?\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in !\n\nMortimer, who had his hand and legs untied by Saunders but is\nstill gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair, moans\nand moves excitedly on his seat.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       (to Jonathan)\n       Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't\n       you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar !\n       Yes, thirteen.\n\nMortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag.\nSince he cannot succeed to get off the chair, he stands up, still\ngagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to Brophy,\ncarrying the armchair with him.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be\n       friends of ours.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       I'll show them to you.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me !\n\nMortimer walks between Brophy and Jonathan, and tries to say\nsomething to Brophy through his gag. Saunders, behind Mortimer,\nkeeps on untying him.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       (to Mortimer)\n       Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care\n       of him.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       (to O'Hara)\n       You come down to the cellar.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       (to Jonathan)\n       Now, wait a minute.\n\nMortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to O'Hara and\nBrophy, and moves excitedly around the two cops. He moves so much\nthat Saunders has stopped trying to untie him.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Thirteen bodies. I'll show you where they're buried.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Oh, yeah !\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Go down to the cellar with him, O'Hara.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       Yes, come to the cellar.\n\nHe grabs O'Hara's hand and drags him to the cellar door.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Well, look, do I have to ?\n\nMortimer, still gagged, and still carrying his armchair like a\nbackpack, tries to follow them, but Saunders moves him away.\nMortimer runs round the table to try again to join the party going\ndown to the cellar, with Saunders running behind him.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Sorry, maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar with\n       him.\n\nMortimer bumps violently into Brophy, who tries to push him away.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       O'Hara, go on down the cellar with him !\n\nMortimer then goes to O'Hara, but O'Hara doesn't realize Mortimer\nis coming to him to prevent him going down to the cellar.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Now, please, Mister Brewster.

Look at that puss. He looks like\n       Boris Karloff.\n\nHearing that, Jonathan screams, jumps on O'Hara and puts his hand\naround his throat.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       (to Jonathan)\n       Don't !\n       (to Brophy)\n       Sarge !\n\nThe three cops and Jonathan starts fighting. A fist comes out of\nthe battle and hits Mortimer on the chin. He staggers back to the\ncenter of the room, and falls on the floor.\n\nWe see Einstein cautiously appearing on the landing of the upper\nfloor of the house. He slowly comes down the stairs.\n\nDown in the sitting-room, the fight goes on. Saunders falls on his\nback and Jonathan jumps on him. O'Hara, in his turn, jumps on\nJonathan. Behind them, Mortimer is slowly getting up and getting\nrid of his ropes. Apparently, his fall has completely untied him.\n\nEinstein, watching this heated fight, moves back to the upper\nfloor.\n\nMortimer gets rid of his gag, and slowly moves away from the\nbattle.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       (voice over)\n       Look out, Pat !... Look out, Pat !\n\n<b>       SAUNDERS\n<\/b>       (voice over)\n       He's got a gun...\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       (voice over)\n       I got him, Pat. Look out !\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Fight. Go on and fight.\n\nMortimer climbs up a few steps on the staircase and sits down on a\nstep.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       (voice over)\n       Pat ! Pat, look out!\n\nMortimer, still seated on the step, quietly gets his cigarette\ncase from his pocket, takes a cigarette, puts the case back in his\npocket, while we hears the noise of the battle still going on down\nbelow.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the\n       bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing.\n\nHe takes a matchbox from another pocket and lights his cigarette.\nBehind Mortimer, on the wall, we see the shadows of the men\nfighting. Then we see various objects falling around Mortimer.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Don't... Don't bother me now.\n\nO'Hara is projected on the wall below the staircase, near the\nplace where Mortimer is still quietly seated.\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Buddy, you could use this in the third act.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       Oh yes, I got something better than this. Let me tell\n       you...\n\nJonathan breaks a chair on his back. O'Hara staggers slightly.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       I'll see you later.\n\nHe goes back in the battle. Jonathan gives him a heavy punch and\nO'Hara falls in the window-seat, closing the lid over himself in\nhis fall.\n\nBack to Mortimer, still quietly smoking his cigarette, seated on\nthe same step. He takes papers out of his pocket.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do\n       I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight-\n       fight !\n\nO'Hara cautiously lifts the lid of the window-seat, but seeing a\nchair flying in his direction, he slams it back shut. The chair\nhits the window-seat and breaks off in small pieces.\n\nBack to Mortimer on his steps. He puts the papers back in his\npocket.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left.\n\nHe puts his hand through the banister of the staircase to take the\ntelephone on the desk, but he cannot reach it.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Telephone. Hey !\n\nAt this moment, Jonathan comes smashing on the wall below the\nstaircase. He grabs the telephone and lifts it to throw it on the\ncops, bringing it within easy reach of Mortimer's hand.\n\n<b>       JONATHAN\n<\/b>       I'll get every one of you ! I hate cops. I'll brain the\n       first one that comes near me !\n\nMortimer picks up the telephone handset, and starts dialing.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Yeah. A little higher, please, brother.\n\nJonathan is watching the cops around him, and he is not looking at\nall at his brother behind him. Without thinking about it, he lifts\nthe telephone a little higher.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine.\nJonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his\nhead toward him. Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him\nwith his stick. Jonathan starts falling, and Mortimer has to pick\nup the telephone not to loose it.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Oh ! Don't do that, please.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Get him, Pat.\n\nSaunders comes on the other side of Jonathan and hits him with his\nstick.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       (in the phone)\n       Come on, doc...\n       (to the cops)\n       That won't have any effect. I've tried it before...\n\nJonathan falls heavily on the floor.\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ?\n\nO'Hara slowly lifts the lid of the window-seat.\n\nSaunders bends on the motionless body of Jonathan\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.\n\nThe doorbell rings, and we see the shadow of a hatted man through\nthe frosted glass. Mortimer looks at the door.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       Witherspoon !\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Come in.\n\nThe visitor enters. It's Lieutenant Rooney, a plain-cloth\npoliceman. He closes the door behind him. Both Brophy and Saunders\nstand at attention. Mortimer puts the phone receiver back on its\nhook. O'Hara comes out of the window-seat, and, seeing his\nsuperior, stands at attention. Rooney walks to the body of\nJonathan.\n\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\n<\/b>       What has occurred ?\n\n<b>       BROPHY & SAUNDERS\n<\/b>       (speaking together)\n       Well, we...\n\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\n<\/b>       Never mind !

We were just acting in self-defense.\n\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\n<\/b>       (pointing to the body of Jonathan)\n       What happened ? He put up a fight ?\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       This isn't the one who blows the bugle. This is his\n       brother. He tried to kill O'Hara.\n\n<b>       O'HARA\n<\/b>       All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.\n\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\n<\/b>       Boris ?... Turn him over.\n\nSaunders turns Jonathan over and both the lieutenant and Brophy\nbends on the face of Jonathan.\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.\nRooney stands up and looks at Brophy with an ironical smile.\n\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\n<\/b>       Oh ! You \u00abkind of think he's wanted somewhere\u00bb ? If you\n       guys can't look at the circulars we put up in the station,\n       you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly,\n       he's wanted somewhere. In Indiana ! He escaped from the\n       prison for criminally insane. He's a lifer.\n\nStill seated on his step, Mortimer smiles.\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       That's my brother !\n\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\n<\/b>       For Pete's sake, that's the way they described him. \u00abHe\n       looked like Karloff\u00bb. Why'd you have to knock him off ?\n\n<b>       BROPHY\n<\/b>       He tried to get us to go down to the cellar.

Just sign right here, please, Doctor.\nEinstein signs the paper Mortimer gives him. Meanwhile, Rooney and\nSaunders are coming out of the kitchen and crossing the room.\n\n<b>       ABBY\n<\/b>       Were you leaving, Doctor ?\n\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\n<\/b>       Yes, please.\n\n<b>       MARTHA\n<\/b>       Oh !

Read it to me, will you ?\n\nEinstein leaves the table, and almost bumps into Saunders, who is\nbrushing his uniform. He listen to the description of himself that\nRooney is repeating from his colleague at the police station.\n\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\n<\/b>       (still on the phone)\n       Yeah...

You've done Brooklyn a\n       great service.\n\nHe shakes Einstein's hand and slaps his back. Einstein cannot\nbelieve his luck. He smiles and rushes to the door.\n\n<b>       ABBY\n<\/b>       But Dr. Einstein !\n\nEinstein picks up his suitcase, and rushes out of the door, and\ncloses it behind him.\n\n<b>       WITHERSPOON\n<\/b>       (to Mortimer)\n       Now, Mister Witherspoon...\n\n<b>       MORTIMER\n<\/b>       No, no, you're Mister Witherspoon, I'm Mister Brewster.\n<b>       WITHERSPOON\n<\/b>       (laughing)\n       It's contagious, yes.
