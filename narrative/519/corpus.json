{"ori_id":"79edfd3070a3b6ccf02a7cbf95254ba9fc95c649","title":"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils","context":"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\n The book is about a young lad, Nils Holgersson, whose \"chief delight was to eat and sleep, and after that he liked best to make mischief\". He takes great delight in hurting the animals in his family farm. Nils captures a tomte in a net while his family is at church and have left him home to memorize chapters from the Bible. The tomte proposes to Nils that if Nils frees him, the tomte will give him a huge gold coin. Nils rejects the offer and the tomte turns Nils into a tomte, which leaves him shrunken and able to talk with animals, who are thrilled to see the boy reduced to their size and are angry and hungry for revenge. While this is happening, wild geese are flying over the farm on one of their migrations, and a white farm goose attempts to join the wild ones. In an attempt to salvage something before his family returns, Nils holds on to the bird's neck as it successfully takes off and joins the wild birds.\nThe wild geese, who are not pleased at all to be joined by a boy and a domestic goose, eventually take him on an adventurous trip across all the historical provinces of Sweden observing in passing their natural characteristics and economic resources. At the same time the characters and situations he encounters make him a man: the domestic goose needs to prove his ability to fly like the experienced wild geese, and Nils needs to prove to the geese that he would be a useful companion, despite their initial misgivings. During the trip, Nils learns that if he proves he has changed for the better, the tomte might be disposed to change him back to his normal size.\nThe book also includes various subplots, concerning people whose lives are touched in one way or another by Nils and the wild geese. For example, one chapter centers on a young provincial man who feels lonely and alienated in the capital Stockholm, is befriended by a nice old gentleman who tells him (and the reader) about the city's history - and only later finds that it was none other than the King of Sweden, walking incognito in the park.\nThe book was criticized for the fact that the goose and boy don't make any stop in the province Halland. In chapter 53 they fly over Halland on the way back to Scania, but they aren't impressed by the sight and they don't stop. However, such a chapter has been added to some translations of the book. In depictions Nils is usually wearing a red cap, although this is erroneous as he is described in the original Swedish edition as wearing a white cap.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Wonderful Adventures of Nils, by Selma Lagerloef\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He was--let us say--something like fourteen years\nold; long and loose-jointed and towheaded. He wasn't good for much, that\nboy. His chief delight was to eat and sleep; and after that--he liked\nbest to make mischief.\n\nIt was a Sunday morning and the boy's parents were getting ready to go\nto church. The boy sat on the edge of the table, in his shirt sleeves,\nand thought how lucky it was that both father and mother were going\naway, and the coast would be clear for a couple of hours. \"Good! Now I\ncan take down pop's gun and fire off a shot, without anybody's meddling\ninterference,\" he said to himself.\n\nBut it was almost as if father should have guessed the boy's thoughts,\nfor just as he was on the threshold--ready to start--he stopped short,\nand turned toward the boy. \"Since you won't come to church with mother\nand me,\" he said, \"the least you can do, is to read the service at home.\nWill you promise to do so?\" \"Yes,\" said the boy, \"that I can do easy\nenough.\" And he thought, of course, that he wouldn't read any more than\nhe felt like reading.\n\nThe boy thought that never had he seen his mother so persistent. In a\nsecond she was over by the shelf near the fireplace, and took down\nLuther's Commentary and laid it on the table, in front of the\nwindow--opened at the service for the day. She also opened the New\nTestament, and placed it beside the Commentary. Finally, she drew up the\nbig arm-chair, which was bought at the parish auction the year before,\nand which, as a rule, no one but father was permitted to occupy.\n\nThe boy sat thinking that his mother was giving herself altogether too\nmuch trouble with this spread; for he had no intention of reading more\nthan a page or so. But now, for the second time, it was almost as if his\nfather were able to see right through him. He walked up to the boy, and\nsaid in a severe tone: \"Now, remember, that you are to read carefully!\nFor when we come back, I shall question you thoroughly; and if you have\nskipped a single page, it will not go well with you.\"\n\n\"The service is fourteen and a half pages long,\" said his mother, just\nas if she wanted to heap up the measure of his misfortune. \"You'll have\nto sit down and begin the reading at once, if you expect to get through\nwith it.\"\n\nWith that they departed. And as the boy stood in the doorway watching\nthem, he thought that he had been caught in a trap. \"There they go\ncongratulating themselves, I suppose, in the belief that they've hit\nupon something so good that I'll be forced to sit and hang over the\nsermon the whole time that they are away,\" thought he.\n\nBut his father and mother were certainly not congratulating themselves\nupon anything of the sort; but, on the contrary, they were very much\ndistressed. They were poor farmers, and their place was not much bigger\nthan a garden-plot. When they first moved there, the place couldn't feed\nmore than one pig and a pair of chickens; but they were uncommonly\nindustrious and capable folk--and now they had both cows and geese.\nThings had turned out very well for them; and they would have gone to\nchurch that beautiful morning--satisfied and happy--if they hadn't had\ntheir son to think of. Father complained that he was dull and lazy; he\nhad not cared to learn anything at school, and he was such an all-round\ngood-for-nothing, that he could barely be made to tend geese. Mother did\nnot deny that this was true; but she was most distressed because he was\nwild and bad; cruel to animals, and ill-willed toward human beings. \"May\nGod soften his hard heart, and give him a better disposition!\" said the\nmother, \"or else he will be a misfortune, both to himself and to us.\"\n\nThe boy stood for a long time and pondered whether he should read the\nservice or not. Finally, he came to the conclusion that, this time, it\nwas best to be obedient. He seated himself in the easy chair, and began\nto read. But when he had been rattling away in an undertone for a little\nwhile, this mumbling seemed to have a soothing effect upon him--and he\nbegan to nod.\n\nIt was the most beautiful weather outside! It was only the twentieth of\nMarch; but the boy lived in West Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g Township, down in Southern\nSkane, where the spring was already in full swing. It was not as yet\ngreen, but it was fresh and budding. There was water in all the\ntrenches, and the colt's-foot on the edge of the ditch was in bloom. All\nthe weeds that grew in among the stones were brown and shiny. The\nbeech-woods in the distance seemed to swell and grow thicker with every\nsecond. The skies were high--and a clear blue. The cottage door stood\najar, and the lark's trill could be heard in the room. The hens and\ngeese pattered about in the yard, and the cows, who felt the spring air\naway in their stalls, lowed their approval every now and then.\n\nThe boy read and nodded and fought against drowsiness. \"No! I don't want\nto fall asleep,\" thought he, \"for then I'll not get through with this\nthing the whole forenoon.\"\n\nBut--somehow--he fell asleep.\n\nHe did not know whether he had slept a short while, or a long while; but\nhe was awakened by hearing a slight noise back of him.\n\nOn the window-sill, facing the boy, stood a small looking-glass; and\nalmost the entire cottage could be seen in this. As the boy raised his\nhead, he happened to look in the glass; and then he saw that the cover\nto his mother's chest had been opened.\n\nHis mother owned a great, heavy, iron-bound oak chest, which she\npermitted no one but herself to open. Here she treasured all the things\nshe had inherited from her mother, and of these she was especially\ncareful. Here lay a couple of old-time peasant dresses, of red homespun\ncloth, with short bodice and plaited shirt, and a pearl-bedecked breast\npin. There were starched white-linen head-dresses, and heavy silver\nornaments and chains. Folks don't care to go about dressed like that in\nthese days, and several times his mother had thought of getting rid of\nthe old things; but somehow, she hadn't had the heart to do it.\n\nNow the boy saw distinctly--in the glass--that the chest-lid was open.\nHe could not understand how this had happened, for his mother had closed\nthe chest before she went away. She never would have left that precious\nchest open when he was at home, alone.\n\nHe became low-spirited and apprehensive. He was afraid that a thief had\nsneaked his way into the cottage. He didn't dare to move; but sat still\nand stared into the looking-glass.\n\nWhile he sat there and waited for the thief to make his appearance, he\nbegan to wonder what that dark shadow was which fell across the edge of\nthe chest. He looked and looked--and did not want to believe his eyes.\nBut the thing, which at first seemed shadowy, became more and more\nclear to him; and soon he saw that it was something real. It was no less\na thing than an elf who sat there--astride the edge of the chest!\n\nTo be sure, the boy had heard stories about elves, but he had never\ndreamed that they were such tiny creatures. He was no taller than a\nhand's breadth--this one, who sat on the edge of the chest. He had an\nold, wrinkled and beardless face, and was dressed in a black frock coat,\nknee-breeches and a broad-brimmed black hat. He was very trim and smart,\nwith his white laces about the throat and wrist-bands, his buckled\nshoes, and the bows on his garters. He had taken from the chest an\nembroidered piece, and sat and looked at the old-fashioned handiwork\nwith such an air of veneration, that he did not observe the boy had\nawakened.\n\nThe boy was somewhat surprised to see the elf, but, on the other hand,\nhe was not particularly frightened. It was impossible to be afraid of\none who was so little. And since the elf was so absorbed in his own\nthoughts that he neither saw nor heard, the boy thought that it would be\ngreat fun to play a trick on him; to push him over into the chest and\nshut the lid on him, or something of that kind.\n\nBut the boy was not so courageous that he dared to touch the elf with\nhis hands, instead he looked around the room for something to poke him\nwith. He let his gaze wander from the sofa to the leaf-table; from the\nleaf-table to the fireplace. He looked at the kettles, then at the\ncoffee-urn, which stood on a shelf, near the fireplace; on the water\nbucket near the door; and on the spoons and knives and forks and saucers\nand plates, which could be seen through the half-open cupboard door. He\nlooked at his father's gun, which hung on the wall, beside the portrait\nof the Danish royal family, and on the geraniums and fuchsias, which\nblossomed in the window. And last, he caught sight of an old\nbutterfly-snare that hung on the window frame. He had hardly set eyes on\nthat butterfly-snare, before he reached over and snatched it and jumped\nup and swung it alongside the edge of the chest. He was himself\nastonished at the luck he had. He hardly knew how he had managed it--but\nhe had actually snared the elf. The poor little chap lay, head downward,\nin the bottom of the long snare, and could not free himself.\n\nThe first moment the boy hadn't the least idea what he should do with\nhis prize. He was only particular to swing the snare backward and\nforward; to prevent the elf from getting a foothold and clambering up.\n\nThe elf began to speak, and begged, oh! so pitifully, for his freedom.\nHe had brought them good luck--these many years--he said, and deserved\nbetter treatment. Now, if the boy would set him free, he would give him\nan old coin, a silver spoon, and a gold penny, as big as the case on his\nfather's silver watch.\n\nThe boy didn't think that this was much of an offer; but it so\nhappened--that after he had gotten the elf in his power, he was afraid\nof him. He felt that he had entered into an agreement with something\nweird and uncanny; something which did not belong to his world, and he\nwas only too glad to get rid of the horrid thing.\n\nFor this reason he agreed at once to the bargain, and held the snare\nstill, so the elf could crawl out of it. But when the elf was almost out\nof the snare, the boy happened to think that he ought to have bargained\nfor large estates, and all sorts of good things. He should at least have\nmade this stipulation: that the elf must conjure the sermon into his\nhead. \"What a fool I was to let him go!\" thought he, and began to shake\nthe snare violently, so the elf would tumble down again.\n\nBut the instant the boy did this, he received such a stinging box on the\near, that he thought his head would fly in pieces. He was dashed--first\nagainst one wall, then against the other; he sank to the floor, and lay\nthere--senseless.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was alone in the cottage. The chest-lid was down, and\nthe butterfly-snare hung in its usual place by the window. If he had not\nfelt how the right cheek burned, from that box on the ear, he would have\nbeen tempted to believe the whole thing had been a dream. \"At any rate,\nfather and mother will be sure to insist that it was nothing else,\"\nthought he. \"They are not likely to make any allowances for that old\nsermon, on account of the elf. It's best for me to get at that reading\nagain,\" thought he.\n\nBut as he walked toward the table, he noticed something remarkable. It\ncouldn't be possible that the cottage had grown. But why was he obliged\nto take so many more steps than usual to get to the table? And what was\nthe matter with the chair? It looked no bigger than it did a while ago;\nbut now he had to step on the rung first, and then clamber up in order\nto reach the seat. It was the same thing with the table. He could not\nlook over the top without climbing to the arm of the chair.\n\n\"What in all the world is this?\" said the boy. \"I believe the elf has\nbewitched both the armchair and the table--and the whole cottage.\"\n\nThe Commentary lay on the table and, to all appearances, it was not\nchanged; but there must have been something queer about that too, for he\ncould not manage to read a single word of it, without actually standing\nright in the book itself.\n\nHe read a couple of lines, and then he chanced to look up. With that,\nhis glance fell on the looking-glass; and then he cried aloud: \"Look!\nThere's another one!\"\n\nFor in the glass he saw plainly a little, little creature who was\ndressed in a hood and leather breeches.\n\n\"Why, that one is dressed exactly like me!\" said the boy, and clasped\nhis hands in astonishment. But then he saw that the thing in the mirror\ndid the same thing. Then he began to pull his hair and pinch his arms\nand swing round; and instantly he did the same thing after him; he, who\nwas seen in the mirror.\n\nThe boy ran around the glass several times, to see if there wasn't a\nlittle man hidden behind it, but he found no one there; and then he\nbegan to shake with terror. For now he understood that the elf had\nbewitched him, and that the creature whose image he saw in the\nglass--was he, himself.\n\nTHE WILD GEESE\n\nThe boy simply could not make himself believe that he had been\ntransformed into an elf. \"It can't be anything but a dream--a queer\nfancy,\" thought he. \"If I wait a few moments, I'll surely be turned back\ninto a human being again.\"\n\nHe placed himself before the glass and closed his eyes. He opened them\nagain after a couple of minutes, and then expected to find that it had\nall passed over--but it hadn't. He was--and remained--just as little. In\nother respects, he was the same as before. The thin, straw-coloured\nhair; the freckles across his nose; the patches on his leather breeches\nand the darns on his stockings, were all like themselves, with this\nexception--that they had become diminished.\n\nNo, it would do no good for him to stand still and wait, of this he was\ncertain. He must try something else. And he thought the wisest thing\nthat he could do was to try and find the elf, and make his peace with\nhim.\n\nAnd while he sought, he cried and prayed and promised everything he\ncould think of. Nevermore would he break his word to anyone; never again\nwould he be naughty; and never, never would he fall asleep again over\nthe sermon. If he might only be a human being once more, he would be\nsuch a good and helpful and obedient boy. But no matter how much he\npromised--it did not help him the least little bit.\n\nSuddenly he remembered that he had heard his mother say, all the tiny\nfolk made their home in the cowsheds; and, at once, he concluded to go\nthere, and see if he couldn't find the elf. It was a lucky thing that\nthe cottage-door stood partly open, for he never could have reached the\nbolt and opened it; but now he slipped through without any difficulty.\n\nWhen he came out in the hallway, he looked around for his wooden shoes;\nfor in the house, to be sure, he had gone about in his stocking-feet. He\nwondered how he should manage with these big, clumsy wooden shoes; but\njust then, he saw a pair of tiny shoes on the doorstep. When he observed\nthat the elf had been so thoughtful that he had also bewitched the\nwooden shoes, he was even more troubled. It was evidently his intention\nthat this affliction should last a long time.\n\nOn the wooden board-walk in front of the cottage, hopped a gray sparrow.\nHe had hardly set eyes on the boy before he called out: \"Teetee! Teetee!\nLook at Nils goosey-boy! Look at Thumbietot! Look at Nils Holgersson\nThumbietot!\"\n\nInstantly, both the geese and the chickens turned and stared at the boy;\nand then they set up a fearful cackling. \"Cock-el-i-coo,\" crowed the\nrooster, \"good enough for him! Cock-el-i-coo, he has pulled my comb.\"\n\"Ka, ka, kada, serves him right!\" cried the hens; and with that they\nkept up a continuous cackle. The geese got together in a tight group,\nstuck their heads together and asked: \"Who can have done this? Who can\nhave done this?\"\n\nBut the strangest thing of all was, that the boy understood what they\nsaid. He was so astonished, that he stood there as if rooted to the\ndoorstep, and listened. \"It must be because I am changed into an elf,\"\nsaid he. \"This is probably why I understand bird-talk.\"\n\nHe thought it was unbearable that the hens would not stop saying that it\nserved him right. He threw a stone at them and shouted:\n\n\"Shut up, you pack!\"\n\nBut it hadn't occurred to him before, that he was no longer the sort of\nboy the hens need fear. The whole henyard made a rush for him, and\nformed a ring around him; then they all cried at once: \"Ka, ka, kada,\nserved you right! Ka, ka, kada, served you right!\"\n\nThe boy tried to get away, but the chickens ran after him and screamed,\nuntil he thought he'd lose his hearing. It is more than likely that he\nnever could have gotten away from them, if the house cat hadn't come\nalong just then. As soon as the chickens saw the cat, they quieted down\nand pretended to be thinking of nothing else than just to scratch in the\nearth for worms.\n\nImmediately the boy ran up to the cat. \"You dear pussy!\" said he, \"you\nmust know all the corners and hiding places about here? You'll be a good\nlittle kitty and tell me where I can find the elf.\"\n\nThe cat did not reply at once. He seated himself, curled his tail into\na graceful ring around his paws--and stared at the boy. It was a large\nblack cat with one white spot on his chest. His fur lay sleek and soft,\nand shone in the sunlight. The claws were drawn in, and the eyes were a\ndull gray, with just a little narrow dark streak down the centre. The\ncat looked thoroughly good-natured and inoffensive.\n\n\"I know well enough where the elf lives,\" he said in a soft voice, \"but\nthat doesn't say that I'm going to tell _you_ about it.\"\n\n\"Dear pussy, you must tell me where the elf lives!\" said the boy. \"Can't\nyou see how he has bewitched me?\"\n\nThe cat opened his eyes a little, so that the green wickedness began to\nshine forth. He spun round and purred with satisfaction before he\nreplied. \"Shall I perhaps help you because you have so often grabbed me\nby the tail?\" he said at last.\n\nThen the boy was furious and forgot entirely how little and helpless he\nwas now. \"Oh! I can pull your tail again, I can,\" said he, and ran\ntoward the cat.\n\nThe next instant the cat was so changed that the boy could scarcely\nbelieve it was the same animal. Every separate hair on his body stood on\nend. The back was bent; the legs had become elongated; the claws scraped\nthe ground; the tail had grown thick and short; the ears were laid back;\nthe mouth was frothy; and the eyes were wide open and glistened like\nsparks of red fire.\n\nThe boy didn't want to let himself be scared by a cat, and he took a\nstep forward. Then the cat made one spring and landed right on the boy;\nknocked him down and stood over him--his forepaws on his chest, and his\njaws wide apart--over his throat.\n\nThe boy felt how the sharp claws sank through his vest and shirt and\ninto his skin; and how the sharp eye-teeth tickled his throat. He\nshrieked for help, as loudly as he could, but no one came. He thought\nsurely that his last hour had come. Then he felt that the cat drew in\nhis claws and let go the hold on his throat.\n\n\"There!\" he said, \"that will do now. I'll let you go this time, for my\nmistress's sake. I only wanted you to know which one of us two has the\npower now.\"\n\nWith that the cat walked away--looking as smooth and pious as he did\nwhen he first appeared on the scene. The boy was so crestfallen that he\ndidn't say a word, but only hurried to the cowhouse to look for the elf.\n\nThere were not more than three cows, all told. But when the boy came in,\nthere was such a bellowing and such a kick-up, that one might easily\nhave believed that there were at least thirty.\n\n\"Moo, moo, moo,\" bellowed Mayrose. \"It is well there is such a thing as\njustice in this world.\"\n\n\"Moo, moo, moo,\" sang the three of them in unison. He couldn't hear what\nthey said, for each one tried to out-bellow the others.\n\nThe boy wanted to ask after the elf, but he couldn't make himself heard\nbecause the cows were in full uproar. They carried on as they used to do\nwhen he let a strange dog in on them. They kicked with their hind legs,\nshook their necks, stretched their heads, and measured the distance with\ntheir horns.\n\n\"Come here, you!\" said Mayrose, \"and you'll get a kick that you won't\nforget in a hurry!\"\n\n\"Come here,\" said Gold Lily, \"and you shall dance on my horns!\"\n\n\"Come here, and you shall taste how it felt when you threw your wooden\nshoes at me, as you did last summer!\" bawled Star.\n\n\"Come here, and you shall be repaid for that wasp you let loose in my\near!\" growled Gold Lily.\n\nMayrose was the oldest and the wisest of them, and she was the very\nmaddest. \"Come here!\" said she, \"that I may pay you back for the many\ntimes that you have jerked the milk pail away from your mother; and for\nall the snares you laid for her, when she came carrying the milk pails;\nand for all the tears when she has stood here and wept over you!\"\n\nThe boy wanted to tell them how he regretted that he had been unkind to\nthem; and that never, never--from now on--should he be anything but\ngood, if they would only tell him where the elf was. But the cows didn't\nlisten to him. They made such a racket that he began to fear one of them\nwould succeed in breaking loose; and he thought that the best thing for\nhim to do was to go quietly away from the cowhouse.\n\nWhen he came out, he was thoroughly disheartened. He could understand\nthat no one on the place wanted to help him find the elf. And little\ngood would it do him, probably, if the elf were found.\n\nHe crawled up on the broad hedge which fenced in the farm, and which was\novergrown with briers and lichen. There he sat down to think about how\nit would go with him, if he never became a human being again. When\nfather and mother came home from church, there would be a surprise for\nthem. Yes, a surprise--it would be all over the land; and people would\ncome flocking from East Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g, and from Torp, and from Skerup. The\nwhole Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g township would come to stare at him. Perhaps father and\nmother would take him with them, and show him at the market place in\nKivik.\n\nNo, that was too horrible to think about. He would rather that no human\nbeing should ever see him again.\n\nHis unhappiness was simply frightful! No one in all the world was so\nunhappy as he. He was no longer a human being--but a freak.\n\nLittle by little he began to comprehend what it meant--to be no longer\nhuman. He was separated from everything now; he could no longer play\nwith other boys, he could not take charge of the farm after his parents\nwere gone; and certainly no girl would think of marrying _him_.\n\nHe sat and looked at his home. It was a little log house, which lay as\nif it had been crushed down to earth, under the high, sloping roof. The\nouthouses were also small; and the patches of ground were so narrow that\na horse could barely turn around on them. But little and poor though the\nplace was, it was much too good for him _now_. He couldn't ask for any\nbetter place than a hole under the stable floor.\n\nIt was wondrously beautiful weather! It budded, and it rippled, and it\nmurmured, and it twittered--all around him. But he sat there with such a\nheavy sorrow. He should never be happy any more about anything.\n\nNever had he seen the skies as blue as they were to-day. Birds of\npassage came on their travels. They came from foreign lands, and had\ntravelled over the East sea, by way of Smygahuk, and were now on their\nway North. They were of many different kinds; but he was only familiar\nwith the wild geese, who came flying in two long rows, which met at an\nangle.\n\nSeveral flocks of wild geese had already flown by. They flew very high,\nstill he could hear how they shrieked: \"To the hills! Now we're off to\nthe hills!\"\n\nWhen the wild geese saw the tame geese, who walked about the farm, they\nsank nearer the earth, and called: \"Come along! Come along! We're off to\nthe hills!\"\n\nThe tame geese could not resist the temptation to raise their heads and\nlisten, but they answered very sensibly: \"We're pretty well off where we\nare. We're pretty well off where we are.\"\n\nIt was, as we have said, an uncommonly fine day, with an atmosphere that\nit must have been a real delight to fly in, so light and bracing. And\nwith each new wild geese-flock that flew by, the tame geese became more\nand more unruly. A couple of times they flapped their wings, as if they\nhad half a mind to fly along. But then an old mother-goose would always\nsay to them: \"Now don't be silly. Those creatures will have to suffer\nboth hunger and cold.\"\n\nThere was a young gander whom the wild geese had fired with a passion\nfor adventure. \"If another flock comes this way, I'll follow them,\" said\nhe.\n\nThen there came a new flock, who shrieked like the others, and the young\ngander answered: \"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm coming.\"\n\nHe spread his wings and raised himself into the air; but he was so\nunaccustomed to flying, that he fell to the ground again.\n\nAt any rate, the wild geese must have heard his call, for they turned\nand flew back slowly to see if he was coming.\n\n\"Wait, wait!\" he cried, and made another attempt to fly.\n\nAll this the boy heard, where he lay on the hedge. \"It would be a great\npity,\" thought he, \"if the big goosey-gander should go away. It would be\na big loss to father and mother if he was gone when they came home from\nchurch.\"\n\nWhen he thought of this, once again he entirely forgot that he was\nlittle and helpless. He took one leap right down into the goose-flock,\nand threw his arms around the neck of the goosey-gander. \"Oh, no! You\ndon't fly away this time, sir!\" cried he.\n\nBut just about then, the gander was considering how he should go to\nwork to raise himself from the ground. He couldn't stop to shake the boy\noff, hence he had to go along with him--up in the air.\n\nThey bore on toward the heights so rapidly, that the boy fairly gasped.\nBefore he had time to think that he ought to let go his hold around the\ngander's neck, he was so high up that he would have been killed\ninstantly, if he had fallen to the ground.\n\nThe only thing that he could do to make himself a little more\ncomfortable, was to try and get upon the gander's back. And there he\nwriggled himself forthwith; but not without considerable trouble. And it\nwas not an easy matter, either, to hold himself secure on the slippery\nback, between two swaying wings. He had to dig deep into feathers and\ndown with both hands, to keep from tumbling to the ground.\n\nTHE BIG CHECKED CLOTH\n\nThe boy had grown so giddy that it was a long while before he came to\nhimself. The winds howled and beat against him, and the rustle of\nfeathers and swaying of wings sounded like a whole storm. Thirteen geese\nflew around him, flapping their wings and honking. They danced before\nhis eyes and they buzzed in his ears. He didn't know whether they flew\nhigh or low, or in what direction they were travelling.\n\nAfter a bit, he regained just enough sense to understand that he ought\nto find out where the geese were taking him. But this was not so easy,\nfor he didn't know how he should ever muster up courage enough to look\ndown. He was sure he'd faint if he attempted it.\n\nThe wild geese were not flying very high because the new travelling\ncompanion could not breathe in the very thinnest air. For his sake they\nalso flew a little slower than usual.\n\nAt last the boy just made himself cast one glance down to earth. Then he\nthought that a great big rug lay spread beneath him, which was made up\nof an incredible number of large and small checks.\n\n\"Where in all the world am I now?\" he wondered.\n\nHe saw nothing but check upon check. Some were broad and ran crosswise,\nand some were long and narrow--all over, there were angles and corners.\nNothing was round, and nothing was crooked.\n\n\"What kind of a big, checked cloth is this that I'm looking down on?\"\nsaid the boy to himself without expecting anyone to answer him.\n\nBut instantly the wild geese who flew about him called out: \"Fields and\nmeadows. Fields and meadows.\"\n\nThen he understood that the big, checked cloth he was travelling over\nwas the flat land of southern Sweden; and he began to comprehend why it\nlooked so checked and multi-coloured. The bright green checks he\nrecognised first; they were rye fields that had been sown in the fall,\nand had kept themselves green under the winter snows. The yellowish-gray\nchecks were stubble-fields--the remains of the oat-crop which had grown\nthere the summer before. The brownish ones were old clover meadows: and\nthe black ones, deserted grazing lands or ploughed-up fallow pastures.\nThe brown checks with the yellow edges were, undoubtedly, beech-tree\nforests; for in these you'll find the big trees which grow in the heart\nof the forest--naked in winter; while the little beech-trees, which grow\nalong the borders, keep their dry, yellowed leaves way into the spring.\nThere were also dark checks with gray centres: these were the large,\nbuilt-up estates encircled by the small cottages with their blackening\nstraw roofs, and their stone-divided land-plots. And then there were\nchecks green in the middle with brown borders: these were the orchards,\nwhere the grass-carpets were already turning green, although the trees\nand bushes around them were still in their nude, brown bark.\n\nThe boy could not keep from laughing when he saw how checked everything\nlooked.\n\nBut when the wild geese heard him laugh, they called out--kind o'\nreprovingly: \"Fertile and good land. Fertile and good land.\"\n\nThe boy had already become serious. \"To think that you can laugh; you,\nwho have met with the most terrible misfortune that can possibly happen\nto a human being!\" thought he. And for a moment he was pretty serious;\nbut it wasn't long before he was laughing again.\n\nNow that he had grown somewhat accustomed to the ride and the speed, so\nthat he could think of something besides holding himself on the gander's\nback, he began to notice how full the air was of birds flying northward.\nAnd there was a shouting and a calling from flock to flock. \"So you came\nover to-day?\" shrieked some. \"Yes,\" answered the geese. \"How do you\nthink the spring's getting on?\" \"Not a leaf on the trees and ice-cold\nwater in the lakes,\" came back the answer.\n\nWhen the geese flew over a place where they saw any tame, half-naked\nfowl, they shouted: \"What's the name of this place? What's the name of\nthis place?\" Then the roosters cocked their heads and answered: \"Its\nname's Lillgarde this year--the same as last year.\"\n\nMost of the cottages were probably named after their owners--which is\nthe custom in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. But instead of saying this is \"Per Matssons,\" or\n\"Ola Bossons,\" the roosters hit upon the kind of names which, to their\nway of thinking, were more appropriate. Those who lived on small farms,\nand belonged to poor cottagers, cried: \"This place is called\nGrainscarce.\" And those who belonged to the poorest hut-dwellers\nscreamed: \"The name of this place is Little-to-eat, Little-to-eat,\nLittle-to-eat.\"\n\nThe big, well-cared-for farms got high-sounding names from the\nroosters--such as Luckymeadows, Eggberga and Moneyville.\n\nBut the roosters on the great landed estates were too high and mighty to\ncondescend to anything like jesting. One of them crowed and called out\nwith such gusto that it sounded as if he wanted to be heard clear up to\nthe sun: \"This is Herr Dybeck's estate; the same this year as last year;\nthis year as last year.\"\n\nA little further on strutted one rooster who crowed: \"This is Swanholm,\nsurely all the world knows that!\"\n\nThe boy observed that the geese did not fly straight forward; but\nzigzagged hither and thither over the whole South country, just as\nthough they were glad to be in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne again and wanted to pay their\nrespects to every separate place.\n\nThey came to one place where there were a number of big, clumsy-looking\nbuildings with great, tall chimneys, and all around these were a lot of\nsmaller houses. \"This is Jordberga Sugar Refinery,\" cried the roosters.\nThe boy shuddered as he sat there on the goose's back. He ought to have\nrecognised this place, for it was not very far from his home.\n\nHere he had worked the year before as a watch boy; but, to be sure,\nnothing was exactly like itself when one saw it like that--from up\nabove.\n\nAnd think! Just think! Osa the goose girl and little Mats, who were his\ncomrades last year! Indeed the boy would have been glad to know if they\nstill were anywhere about here. Fancy what they would have said, had\nthey suspected that he was flying over their heads!\n\nSoon Jordberga was lost to sight, and they travelled towards Svedala and\nSkaber Lake and back again over G\u00c3\u00b6rringe Cloister and H\u00c3\u00a4ckeberga. The\nboy saw more of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne in this one day than he had ever seen before--in\nall the years that he had lived.\n\nWhenever the wild geese happened across any tame geese, they had the\nbest fun! They flew forward very slowly and called down: \"We're off to\nthe hills. Are you coming along? Are you coming along?\"\n\nBut the tame geese answered: \"It's still winter in this country. You're\nout too soon. Fly back! Fly back!\"\n\nThe wild geese lowered themselves that they might be heard a little\nbetter, and called: \"Come along! We'll teach you how to fly and swim.\"\n\nThen the tame geese got mad and wouldn't answer them with a single honk.\n\nThe wild geese sank themselves still lower--until they almost touched\nthe ground--then, quick as lightning, they raised themselves, just as if\nthey'd been terribly frightened. \"Oh, oh, oh!\" they exclaimed. \"Those\nthings were not geese. They were only sheep, they were only sheep.\"\n\nThe ones on the ground were beside themselves with rage and shrieked:\n\"May you be shot, the whole lot o' you! The whole lot o' you!\"\n\nWhen the boy heard all this teasing he laughed. Then he remembered how\nbadly things had gone with him, and he cried. But the next second, he\nwas laughing again.\n\nNever before had he ridden so fast; and to ride fast and\nrecklessly--that he had always liked. And, of course, he had never\ndreamed that it could be as fresh and bracing as it was, up in the air;\nor that there rose from the earth such a fine scent of resin and soil.\nNor had he ever dreamed what it could be like--to ride so high above the\nearth. It was just like flying away from sorrow and trouble and\nannoyances of every kind that could be thought of.\n\n\nAKKA FROM KEBNEKAISE\n\n\nEVENING\n\nThe big tame goosey-gander that had followed them up in the air, felt\nvery proud of being permitted to travel back and forth over the South\ncountry with the wild geese, and crack jokes with the tame birds. But in\nspite of his keen delight, he began to tire as the afternoon wore on. He\ntried to take deeper breaths and quicker wing-strokes, but even so he\nremained several goose-lengths behind the others.\n\nWhen the wild geese who flew last, noticed that the tame one couldn't\nkeep up with them, they began to call to the goose who rode in the\ncentre of the angle and led the procession: \"Akka from Kebnekaise! Akka\nfrom Kebnekaise!\" \"What do you want of me?\" asked the leader. \"The white\none will be left behind; the white one will be left behind.\" \"Tell him\nit's easier to fly fast than slow!\" called the leader, and raced on as\nbefore.\n\nThe goosey-gander certainly tried to follow the advice, and increase his\nspeed; but then he became so exhausted that he sank away down to the\ndrooping willows that bordered the fields and meadows.\n\n\"Akka, Akka, Akka from Kebnekaise!\" cried those who flew last and saw\nwhat a hard time he was having. \"What do you want now?\" asked the\nleader--and she sounded awfully angry. \"The white one sinks to the\nearth; the white one sinks to the earth.\" \"Tell him it's easier to fly\nhigh than low!\" shouted the leader, and she didn't slow up the least\nlittle bit, but raced on as before.\n\nThe goosey-gander tried also to follow this advice; but when he wanted\nto raise himself, he became so winded that he almost burst his breast.\n\n\"Akka, Akka!\" again cried those who flew last. \"Can't you let me fly in\npeace?\" asked the leader, and she sounded even madder than before.\n\n\"The white one is ready to collapse.\" \"Tell him that he who has not the\nstrength to fly with the flock, can go back home!\" cried the leader. She\ncertainly had no idea of decreasing her speed--but raced on as before.\n\n\"Oh! is that the way the wind blows,\" thought the goosey-gander. He\nunderstood at once that the wild geese had never intended to take him\nalong up to Lapland. They had only lured him away from home in sport.\n\nHe felt thoroughly exasperated. To think that his strength should fail\nhim now, so he wouldn't be able to show these tramps that even a tame\ngoose was good for something! But the most provoking thing of all was\nthat he had fallen in with Akka from Kebnekaise. Tame goose that he was,\nhe had heard about a leader goose, named Akka, who was more than a\nhundred years old. She had such a big name that the best wild geese in\nthe world followed her. But no one had such a contempt for tame geese\nas Akka and her flock, and gladly would he have shown them that he was\ntheir equal.\n\nHe flew slowly behind the rest, while he deliberated whether he should\nturn back or continue. Finally, the little creature that he carried on\nhis back said: \"Dear Morten Goosey-gander, you know well enough that it\nis simply impossible for you, who have never flown, to go with the wild\ngeese all the way up to Lapland. Won't you turn back before you kill\nyourself?\"\n\nBut the farmer's lad was about the worst thing the goosey-gander knew\nanything about, and as soon as it dawned on him that this puny creature\nactually believed that he couldn't make the trip, he decided to stick it\nout. \"If you say another word about this, I'll drop you into the first\nditch we ride over!\" said he, and at the same time his fury gave him so\nmuch strength that he began to fly almost as well as any of the others.\n\nIt isn't likely that he could have kept this pace up very long, neither\nwas it necessary; for, just then, the sun sank quickly; and at sunset\nthe geese flew down, and before the boy and the goosey-gander knew what\nhad happened, they stood on the shores of Vomb Lake.\n\n\"They probably intend that we shall spend the night here,\" thought the\nboy, and jumped down from the goose's back.\n\nHe stood on a narrow beach by a fair-sized lake. It was ugly to look\nupon, because it was almost entirely covered with an ice-crust that was\nblackened and uneven and full of cracks and holes--as spring ice\ngenerally is.\n\nThe ice was already breaking up. It was loose and floating and had a\nbroad belt of dark, shiny water all around it; but there was still\nenough of it left to spread chill and winter terror over the place.\n\nOn the other side of the lake there appeared to be an open and light\ncountry, but where the geese had lighted there was a thick pine-growth.\nIt looked as if the forest of firs and pines had the power to bind the\nwinter to itself. Everywhere else the ground was bare; but beneath the\nsharp pine-branches lay snow that had been melting and freezing, melting\nand freezing, until it was hard as ice.\n\nThe boy thought he had struck an arctic wilderness, and he was so\nmiserable that he wanted to scream. He was hungry too. He hadn't eaten a\nbite the whole day. But where should he find any food? Nothing eatable\ngrew on either ground or tree in the month of March.\n\nYes, where was he to find food, and who would give him shelter, and who\nwould fix his bed, and who would protect him from the wild beasts?\n\nFor now the sun was away and frost came from the lake, and darkness sank\ndown from heaven, and terror stole forward on the twilight's trail, and\nin the forest it began to patter and rustle.\n\nNow the good humour which the boy had felt when he was up in the air,\nwas gone, and in his misery he looked around for his travelling\ncompanions. He had no one but them to cling to now.\n\nThen he saw that the goosey-gander was having even a worse time of it\nthan he. He was lying prostrate on the spot where he had alighted; and\nit looked as if he were ready to die. His neck lay flat against the\nground, his eyes were closed, and his breathing sounded like a feeble\nhissing.\n\n\"Dear Morten Goosey-Gander,\" said the boy, \"try to get a swallow of\nwater! It isn't two steps to the lake.\"\n\nBut the goosey-gander didn't stir.\n\nThe boy had certainly been cruel to all animals, and to the\ngoosey-gander in times gone by; but now he felt that the goosey-gander\nwas the only comfort he had left, and he was dreadfully afraid of losing\nhim.\n\nAt once the boy began to push and drag him, to get him into the water,\nbut the goosey-gander was big and heavy, and it was mighty hard work for\nthe boy; but at last he succeeded.\n\nThe goosey-gander got in head first. For an instant he lay motionless in\nthe slime, but soon he poked up his head, shook the water from his eyes\nand sniffed. Then he swam, proudly, between reeds and seaweed.\n\nThe wild geese were in the lake before him. They had not looked around\nfor either the goosey-gander or for his rider, but had made straight\nfor the water. They had bathed and primped, and now they lay and gulped\nhalf-rotten pond-weed and water-clover.\n\nThe white goosey-gander had the good fortune to spy a perch. He grabbed\nit quickly, swam ashore with it, and laid it down in front of the boy.\n\"Here's a thank you for helping me into the water,\" said he.\n\nIt was the first time the boy had heard a friendly word that day. He was\nso happy that he wanted to throw his arms around the goosey-gander's\nneck, but he refrained; and he was also thankful for the gift. At first\nhe must have thought that it would be impossible to eat raw fish, and\nthen he had a notion to try it.\n\nHe felt to see if he still had his sheath-knife with him; and, sure\nenough, there it hung--on the back button of his trousers, although it\nwas so diminished that it was hardly as long as a match. Well, at any\nrate, it served to scale and cleanse fish with; and it wasn't long\nbefore the perch was eaten.\n\nWhen the boy had satisfied his hunger, he felt a little ashamed because\nhe had been able to eat a raw thing. \"It's evident that I'm not a human\nbeing any longer, but a real elf,\" thought he.\n\nWhile the boy ate, the goosey-gander stood silently beside him. But when\nhe had swallowed the last bite, he said in a low voice: \"It's a fact\nthat we have run across a stuck-up goose folk who despise all tame\nbirds.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've observed that,\" said the boy.\n\n\"What a triumph it would be for me if I could follow them clear up to\nLapland, and show them that even a tame goose can do things!\"\n\n\"Y-e-e-s,\" said the boy, and drawled it out because he didn't believe\nthe goosey-gander could ever do it; yet he didn't wish to contradict\nhim. \"But I don't think I can get along all alone on such a journey,\"\nsaid the goosey-gander. \"I'd like to ask if you couldn't come along and\nhelp me?\" The boy, of course, hadn't expected anything but to return to\nhis home as soon as possible, and he was so surprised that he hardly\nknew what he should reply. \"I thought that we were enemies, you and I,\"\nsaid he. But this the goosey-gander seemed to have forgotten entirely.\nHe only remembered that the boy had but just saved his life.\n\n\"I suppose I really ought to go home to father and mother,\" said the\nboy. \"Oh! I'll get you back to them some time in the fall,\" said the\ngoosey-gander. \"I shall not leave you until I put you down on your own\ndoorstep.\"\n\nThe boy thought it might be just as well for him if he escaped showing\nhimself before his parents for a while. He was not disinclined to favour\nthe scheme, and was just on the point of saying that he agreed to\nit--when they heard a loud rumbling behind them. It was the wild geese\nwho had come up from the lake--all at one time--and stood shaking the\nwater from their backs. After that they arranged themselves in a long\nrow--with the leader-goose in the centre--and came toward them.\n\nAs the white goosey-gander sized up the wild geese, he felt ill at ease.\nHe had expected that they should be more like tame geese, and that he\nshould feel a closer kinship with them. They were much smaller than he,\nand none of them were white. They were all gray with a sprinkling of\nbrown. He was almost afraid of their eyes. They were yellow, and shone\nas if a fire had been kindled back of them. The goosey-gander had always\nbeen taught that it was most fitting to move slowly and with a rolling\nmotion, but these creatures did not walk--they half ran. He grew most\nalarmed, however, when he looked at their feet. These were large, and\nthe soles were torn and ragged-looking. It was evident that the wild\ngeese never questioned what they tramped upon. They took no by-paths.\nThey were very neat and well cared for in other respects, but one could\nsee by their feet that they were poor wilderness-folk.\n\nThe goosey-gander only had time to whisper to the boy: \"Speak up quickly\nfor yourself, but don't tell them who you are!\"--before the geese were\nupon them.\n\nWhen the wild geese had stopped in front of them, they curtsied with\ntheir necks many times, and the goosey-gander did likewise many more\ntimes. As soon as the ceremonies were over, the leader-goose said: \"Now\nI presume we shall hear what kind of creatures you are.\"\n\n\"There isn't much to tell about me,\" said the goosey-gander. \"I was born\nin Skanor last spring. In the fall I was sold to Holger Nilsson of West\nVemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g, and there I have lived ever since.\" \"You don't seem to have\nany pedigree to boast of,\" said the leader-goose. \"What is it, then,\nthat makes you so high-minded that you wish to associate with wild\ngeese?\" \"It may be because I want to show you wild geese that we tame\nones may also be good for something,\" said the goosey-gander. \"Yes, it\nwould be well if you could show us that,\" said the leader-goose. \"We\nhave already observed how much you know about flying; but you are more\nskilled, perhaps, in other sports. Possibly you are strong in a swimming\nmatch?\" \"No, I can't boast that I am,\" said the goosey-gander. It seemed\nto him that the leader-goose had already made up her mind to send him\nhome, so he didn't much care how he answered. \"I never swam any farther\nthan across a marl-ditch,\" he continued. \"Then I presume you're a crack\nsprinter,\" said the goose. \"I have never seen a tame goose run, nor have\nI ever done it myself,\" said the goosey-gander; and he made things\nappear much worse than they really were.\n\nThe big white one was sure now that the leader-goose would say that\nunder no circumstances could they take him along. He was very much\nastonished when she said: \"You answer questions courageously; and he who\nhas courage can become a good travelling companion, even if he is\nignorant in the beginning. What do you say to stopping with us for a\ncouple of days, until we can see what you are good for?\" \"That suits\nme!\" said the goosey-gander--and he was thoroughly happy.\n\nThereupon the leader-goose pointed with her bill and said: \"But who is\nthat you have with you? I've never seen anything like him before.\"\n\"That's my comrade,\" said the goosey-gander. \"He's been a goose-tender\nall his life. He'll be useful all right to take with us on the trip.\"\n\"Yes, he may be all right for a tame goose,\" answered the wild one.\n\"What do you call him?\" \"He has several names,\" said the\ngoosey-gander--hesitantly, not knowing what he should hit upon in a\nhurry, for he didn't want to reveal the fact that the boy had a human\nname. \"Oh! his name is Thumbietot,\" he said at last. \"Does he belong to\nthe elf family?\" asked the leader-goose. \"At what time do you wild geese\nusually retire?\" said the goosey-gander quickly--trying to evade that\nlast question. \"My eyes close of their own accord about this time.\"\n\nOne could easily see that the goose who talked with the gander was very\nold. Her entire feather outfit was ice-gray, without any dark streaks.\nThe head was larger, the legs coarser, and the feet were more worn than\nany of the others. The feathers were stiff; the shoulders knotty; the\nneck thin. All this was due to age. It was only upon the eyes that time\nhad had no effect. They shone brighter--as if they were younger--than\nany of the others!\n\nShe turned, very haughtily, toward the goosey-gander. \"Understand, Mr.\nTame-goose, that I am Akka from Kebnekaise! And that the goose who flies\nnearest me--to the right--is Iksi from Vassijaure, and the one to the\nleft, is Kaksi from Nuolja! Understand, also, that the second right-hand\ngoose is Kolmi from Sarjektjakko, and the second, left, is Nelj\u00c3\u00a4 from\nSvappavaara; and behind them fly Viisi from Oviksfj\u00c3\u00a4llen and Kuusi from\nSjangeli! And know that these, as well as the six goslings who fly\nlast--three to the right, and three to the left--are all high mountain\ngeese of the finest breed! You must not take us for land-lubbers who\nstrike up a chance acquaintance with any and everyone! And you must not\nthink that we permit anyone to share our quarters, that will not tell us\nwho his ancestors were.\"\n\nWhen Akka, the leader-goose, talked in this way, the boy stepped briskly\nforward. It had distressed him that the goosey-gander, who had spoken up\nso glibly for himself, should give such evasive answers when it\nconcerned him. \"I don't care to make a secret of who I am,\" said he. \"My\nname is Nils Holgersson. I'm a farmer's son, and, until to-day, I have\nbeen a human being; but this morning--\" He got no further. As soon as he\nhad said that he was human the leader-goose staggered three steps\nbackward, and the rest of them even farther back. They all extended\ntheir necks and hissed angrily at him.\n\n\"I have suspected this ever since I first saw you here on these shores,\"\nsaid Akka; \"and now you can clear out of here at once. We tolerate no\nhuman beings among us.\"\n\n\"It isn't possible,\" said the goosey-gander, meditatively, \"that you\nwild geese can be afraid of anyone who is so tiny! By to-morrow, of\ncourse, he'll turn back home. You can surely let him stay with us\novernight. None of us can afford to let such a poor little creature\nwander off by himself in the night--among weasels and foxes!\"\n\nThe wild goose came nearer. But it was evident that it was hard for her\nto master her fear. \"I have been taught to fear everything in human\nshape--be it big or little,\" said she. \"But if you will answer for this\none, and swear that he will not harm us, he can stay with us to-night.\nBut I don't believe our night quarters are suitable either for him or\nyou, for we intend to roost on the broken ice out here.\"\n\nShe thought, of course, that the goosey-gander would be doubtful when\nhe heard this, but he never let on. \"She is pretty wise who knows how to\nchoose such a safe bed,\" said he.\n\n\"You will be answerable for his return to his own to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Then I, too, will have to leave you,\" said the goosey-gander. \"I have\nsworn that I would not forsake him.\"\n\n\"You are free to fly whither you will,\" said the leader-goose.\n\nWith this, she raised her wings and flew out over the ice and one after\nanother the wild geese followed her.\n\nThe boy was very sad to think that his trip to Lapland would not come\noff, and, in the bargain, he was afraid of the chilly night quarters.\n\"It will be worse and worse,\" said he. \"In the first place, we'll freeze\nto death on the ice.\"\n\nBut the gander was in a good humour. \"There's no danger,\" said he. \"Only\nmake haste, I beg of you, and gather together as much grass and litter\nas you can well carry.\"\n\nWhen the boy had his arms full of dried grass, the goosey-gander grabbed\nhim by the shirt-band, lifted him, and flew out on the ice, where the\nwild geese were already fast asleep, with their bills tucked under their\nwings.\n\n\"Now spread out the grass on the ice, so there'll be something to stand\non, to keep me from freezing fast. You help me and I'll help you,\" said\nthe goosey-gander.\n\nThis the boy did. And when he had finished, the goosey-gander picked\nhim up, once again, by the shirt-band, and tucked him under his wing. \"I\nthink you'll lie snug and warm there,\" said the goosey-gander as he\ncovered him with his wing.\n\nThe boy was so imbedded in down that he couldn't answer, and he was nice\nand comfy. Oh, but he was tired!--And in less than two winks he was fast\nasleep.\n\nNIGHT\n\nIt is a fact that ice is always treacherous and not to be trusted. In\nthe middle of the night the loosened ice-cake on Vomb Lake moved about,\nuntil one corner of it touched the shore. Now it happened that Mr.\nSmirre Fox, who lived at this time in \u00c3\u0096vid Cloister Park--on the east\nside of the lake--caught a glimpse of that one corner, while he was out\non his night chase. Smirre had seen the wild geese early in the evening,\nand hadn't dared to hope that he might get at one of them, but now he\nwalked right out on the ice.\n\nWhen Smirre was very near to the geese, his claws scraped the ice, and\nthe geese awoke, flapped their wings, and prepared for flight. But\nSmirre was too quick for them. He darted forward as though he'd been\nshot; grabbed a goose by the wing, and ran toward land again.\n\nBut this night the wild geese were not alone on the ice, for they had a\nhuman being among them--little as he was. The boy had awakened when the\ngoosey-gander spread his wings. He had tumbled down on the ice and was\nsitting there, dazed. He hadn't grasped the whys and wherefores of all\nthis confusion, until he caught sight of a little long-legged dog who\nran over the ice with a goose in his mouth.\n\nIn a minute the boy was after that dog, to try and take the goose away\nfrom him. He must have heard the goosey-gander call to him: \"Have a\ncare, Thumbietot! Have a care!\" But the boy thought that such a little\nrunt of a dog was nothing to be afraid of and he rushed ahead.\n\nThe wild goose that Smirre Fox tugged after him, heard the clatter as\nthe boy's wooden shoes beat against the ice, and she could hardly\nbelieve her ears. \"Does that infant think he can take me away from the\nfox?\" she wondered. And in spite of her misery, she began to cackle\nright merrily, deep down in her windpipe. It was almost as if she had\nlaughed.\n\n\"The first thing he knows, he'll fall through a crack in the ice,\"\nthought she.\n\nBut dark as the night was, the boy saw distinctly all the cracks and\nholes there were, and took daring leaps over them. This was because he\nhad the elf's good eyesight now, and could see in the dark. He saw both\nlake and shore just as clearly as if it had been daylight.\n\nSmirre Fox left the ice where it touched the shore. And just as he was\nworking his way up to the land-edge, the boy shouted: \"Drop that goose,\nyou sneak!\"\n\nSmirre didn't know who was calling to him, and wasted no time in looking\naround, but increased his pace. The fox made straight for the forest and\nthe boy followed him, with never a thought of the danger he was running.\nAll he thought about was the contemptuous way in which he had been\nreceived by the wild geese; and he made up his mind to let them see that\na human being was something higher than all else created.\n\nHe shouted, again and again, to that dog, to make him drop his game.\n\"What kind of a dog are you, who can steal a whole goose and not feel\nashamed of yourself? Drop her at once! or you'll see what a beating\nyou'll get. Drop her, I say, or I'll tell your master how you behave!\"\n\nWhen Smirre Fox saw that he had been mistaken for a scary dog, he was so\namused that he came near dropping the goose. Smirre was a great\nplunderer who wasn't satisfied with only hunting rats and pigeons in the\nfields, but he also ventured into the farmyards to steal chickens and\ngeese. He knew that he was feared throughout the district; and anything\nas idiotic as this he had not heard since he was a baby.\n\nThe boy ran so fast that the thick beech-trees appeared to be running\npast him--backward, but he caught up with Smirre. Finally, he was so\nclose to him that he got a hold on his tail. \"Now I'll take the goose\nfrom you anyway,\" cried he, and held on as hard as ever he could, but he\nhadn't strength enough to stop Smirre. The fox dragged him along until\nthe dry foliage whirled around him.\n\nBut now it began to dawn on Smirre how harmless the thing was that\npursued him. He stopped short, put the goose on the ground, and stood on\nher with his forepaws, so she couldn't fly away. He was just about to\nbite off her neck--but then he couldn't resist the desire to tease the\nboy a little. \"Hurry off and complain to the master, for now I'm going\nto bite the goose to death!\" said he.\n\nCertainly the one who was surprised when he saw what a pointed nose, and\nheard what a hoarse and angry voice that dog which he was pursuing\nhad,--was the boy! But now he was so enraged because the fox had made\nfun of him, that he never thought of being frightened. He took a firmer\nhold on the tail, braced himself against a beech trunk; and just as the\nfox opened his jaws over the goose's throat, he pulled as hard as he\ncould. Smirre was so astonished that he let himself be pulled backward a\ncouple of steps--and the wild goose got away. She fluttered upward\nfeebly and heavily. One wing was so badly wounded that she could barely\nuse it. In addition to this, she could not see in the night darkness of\nthe forest but was as helpless as the blind. Therefore she could in no\nway help the boy; so she groped her way through the branches and flew\ndown to the lake again.\n\nThen Smirre made a dash for the boy. \"If I don't get the one, I shall\ncertainly have the other,\" said he; and you could tell by his voice how\nmad he was. \"Oh, don't you believe it!\" said the boy, who was in the\nbest of spirits because he had saved the goose. He held fast by the\nfox-tail, and swung with it--to one side--when the fox tried to catch\nhim.\n\nThere was such a dance in that forest that the dry beech-leaves fairly\nflew! Smirre swung round and round, but the tail swung too; while the\nboy kept a tight grip on it, so the fox could not grab him.\n\nThe boy was so gay after his success that in the beginning, he laughed\nand made fun of the fox. But Smirre was persevering--as old hunters\ngenerally are--and the boy began to fear that he should be captured in\nthe end. Then he caught sight of a little, young beech-tree that had\nshot up as slender as a rod, that it might soon reach the free air above\nthe canopy of branches which the old beeches spread above it.\n\nQuick as a flash, he let go of the fox-tail and climbed the beech tree.\nSmirre Fox was so excited that he continued to dance around after his\ntail.\n\n\"Don't bother with the dance any longer!\" said the boy.\n\nBut Smirre couldn't endure the humiliation of his failure to get the\nbetter of such a little tot, so he lay down under the tree, that he\nmight keep a close watch on him.\n\nThe boy didn't have any too good a time of it where he sat, astride a\nfrail branch. The young beech did not, as yet, reach the high\nbranch-canopy, so the boy couldn't get over to another tree, and he\ndidn't dare to come down again. He was so cold and numb that he almost\nlost his hold around the branch; and he was dreadfully sleepy; but he\ndidn't dare fall asleep for fear of tumbling down.\n\nMy! but it was dismal to sit in that way the whole night through, out in\nthe forest! He never before understood the real meaning of \"night.\" It\nwas just as if the whole world had become petrified, and never could\ncome to life again.\n\nThen it commenced to dawn. The boy was glad that everything began to\nlook like itself once more; although the chill was even sharper than it\nhad been during the night.\n\nFinally, when the sun got up, it wasn't yellow but red. The boy thought\nit looked as though it were angry and he wondered what it was angry\nabout. Perhaps it was because the night had made it so cold and gloomy\non earth, while the sun was away.\n\nThe sunbeams came down in great clusters, to see what the night had been\nup to. It could be seen how everything blushed--as if they all had\nguilty consciences. The clouds in the skies; the satiny beech-limbs; the\nlittle intertwined branches of the forest-canopy; the hoar-frost that\ncovered the foliage on the ground--everything grew flushed and red. More\nand more sunbeams came bursting through space, and soon the night's\nterrors were driven away, and such a marvellous lot of living things\ncame forward. The black woodpecker, with the red neck, began to hammer\nwith its bill on the branch. The squirrel glided from his nest with a\nnut, and sat down on a branch and began to shell it. The starling came\nflying with a worm, and the bulfinch sang in the tree-top.\n\nThen the boy understood that the sun had said to all these tiny\ncreatures: \"Wake up now, and come out of your nests! I'm here! Now you\nneed be afraid of nothing.\"\n\nThe wild-goose call was heard from the lake, as they were preparing for\nflight; and soon all fourteen geese came flying through the forest. The\nboy tried to call to them, but they flew so high that his voice couldn't\nreach them. They probably believed the fox had eaten him up; and they\ndidn't trouble themselves to look for him.\n\nThe boy came near crying with regret; but the sun stood up\nthere--orange-coloured and happy--and put courage into the whole world.\n\"It isn't worth while, Nils Holgersson, for you to be troubled about\nanything, as long as I'm here,\" said the sun.\n\nGOOSE-PLAY\n\n_Monday, March twenty-first_.\n\nEverything remained unchanged in the forest--about as long as it takes a\ngoose to eat her breakfast. But just as the morning was verging on\nforenoon, a goose came flying, all by herself, under the thick\ntree-canopy. She groped her way hesitatingly, between the stems and\nbranches, and flew very slowly. As soon as Smirre Fox saw her, he left\nhis place under the beech tree, and sneaked up toward her. The wild\ngoose didn't avoid the fox, but flew very close to him. Smirre made a\nhigh jump for her but he missed her; and the goose went on her way down\nto the lake.\n\nIt was not long before another goose came flying. She took the same\nroute as the first one; and flew still lower and slower. She, too, flew\nclose to Smirre Fox, and he made such a high spring for her, that his\nears brushed her feet. But she, too, got away from him unhurt, and went\nher way toward the lake, silent as a shadow.\n\nA little while passed and then there came another wild goose. She flew\nstill slower and lower; and it seemed even more difficult for her to\nfind her way between the beech-branches. Smirre made a powerful spring!\nHe was within a hair's breadth of catching her; but that goose also\nmanaged to save herself.\n\nJust after she had disappeared, came a fourth. She flew so slowly, and\nso badly, that Smirre Fox thought he could catch her without much\neffort, but he was afraid of failure now, and concluded to let her fly\npast--unmolested. She took the same direction the others had taken; and\njust as she was come right above Smirre, she sank down so far that he\nwas tempted to jump for her. He jumped so high that he touched her with\nhis tail. But she flung herself quickly to one side and saved her life.\n\nBefore Smirre got through panting, three more geese came flying in a\nrow. They flew just like the rest, and Smirre made high springs for them\nall, but he did not succeed in catching any one of them.\n\nAfter that came five geese; but these flew better than the others. And\nalthough it seemed as if they wanted to lure Smirre to jump, he\nwithstood the temptation. After quite a long time came one single goose.\nIt was the thirteenth. This one was so old that she was gray all over,\nwithout a dark speck anywhere on her body. She didn't appear to use one\nwing very well, but flew so wretchedly and crookedly, that she almost\ntouched the ground. Smirre not only made a high leap for her, but he\npursued her, running and jumping all the way down to the lake. But not\neven this time did he get anything for his trouble.\n\nWhen the fourteenth goose came along, it looked very pretty because it\nwas white. And as its great wings swayed, it glistened like a light, in\nthe dark forest. When Smirre Fox saw this one, he mustered all his\nresources and jumped half-way up to the tree-canopy. But the white one\nflew by unhurt like the rest.\n\nNow it was quiet for a moment under the beeches. It looked as if the\nwhole wild-goose-flock had travelled past.\n\nSuddenly Smirre remembered his prisoner and raised his eyes toward the\nyoung beech-tree. And just as he might have expected--the boy had\ndisappeared.\n\nBut Smirre didn't have much time to think about him; for now the first\ngoose came back again from the lake and flew slowly under the canopy. In\nspite of all his ill luck, Smirre was glad that she came back, and\ndarted after her with a high leap. But he had been in too much of a\nhurry, and hadn't taken the time to calculate the distance, and he\nlanded at one side of the goose. Then there came still another goose;\nthen a third; a fourth; a fifth; and so on, until the angle closed in\nwith the old ice-gray one, and the big white one. They all flew low and\nslow. Just as they swayed in the vicinity of Smirre Fox, they sank\ndown--kind of inviting-like--for him to take them. Smirre ran after them\nand made leaps a couple of fathoms high--but he couldn't manage to get\nhold of a single one of them.\n\nIt was the most awful day that Smirre Fox had ever experienced. The wild\ngeese kept on travelling over his head. They came and went--came and\nwent. Great splendid geese who had eaten themselves fat on the German\nheaths and grain fields, swayed all day through the woods, and so close\nto him that he touched them many times; yet he was not permitted to\nappease his hunger with a single one of them.\n\nThe winter was hardly gone yet, and Smirre recalled nights and days when\nhe had been forced to tramp around in idleness, with not so much as a\nhare to hunt, when the rats hid themselves under the frozen earth; and\nwhen the chickens were all shut up. But all the winter's hunger had not\nbeen as hard to endure as this day's miscalculations.\n\nSmirre was no young fox. He had had the dogs after him many a time, and\nhad heard the bullets whizz around his ears. He had lain in hiding, down\nin the lair, while the dachshunds crept into the crevices and all but\nfound him. But all the anguish that Smirre Fox had been forced to suffer\nunder this hot chase, was not to be compared with what he suffered every\ntime that he missed one of the wild geese.\n\nIn the morning, when the play began, Smirre Fox had looked so stunning\nthat the geese were amazed when they saw him. Smirre loved display. His\ncoat was a brilliant red; his breast white; his nose black; and his tail\nwas as bushy as a plume. But when the evening of this day was come,\nSmirre's coat hung in loose folds. He was bathed in sweat; his eyes were\nwithout lustre; his tongue hung far out from his gaping jaws; and froth\noozed from his mouth.\n\nIn the afternoon Smirre was so exhausted that he grew delirious. He saw\nnothing before his eyes but flying geese. He made leaps for sun-spots\nwhich he saw on the ground; and for a poor little butterfly that had\ncome out of his chrysalis too soon.\n\nThe wild geese flew and flew, unceasingly. All day long they continued\nto torment Smirre. They were not moved to pity because Smirre was done\nup, fevered, and out of his head. They continued without a let-up,\nalthough they understood that he hardly saw them, and that he jumped\nafter their shadows.\n\nWhen Smirre Fox sank down on a pile of dry leaves, weak and powerless\nand almost ready to give up the ghost, they stopped teasing him.\n\n\"Now you know, Mr. Fox, what happens to the one who dares to come near\nAkka of Kebnekaise!\" they shouted in his ear; and with that they left\nhim in peace.\n\n\nTHE WONDERFUL JOURNEY OF NILS\n\n\nON THE FARM\n\n_Thursday, March twenty-fourth_.\n\nJust at that time a thing happened in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne which created a good deal of\ndiscussion and even got into the newspapers but which many believed to\nbe a fable, because they had not been able to explain it.\n\nIt was about like this: A lady squirrel had been captured in the\nhazelbrush that grew on the shores of Vomb Lake, and was carried to a\nfarmhouse close by. All the folks on the farm--both young and old--were\ndelighted with the pretty creature with the bushy tail, the wise,\ninquisitive eyes, and the natty little feet. They intended to amuse\nthemselves all summer by watching its nimble movements; its ingenious\nway of shelling nuts; and its droll play. They immediately put in order\nan old squirrel cage with a little green house and a wire-cylinder\nwheel. The little house, which had both doors and windows, the lady\nsquirrel was to use as a dining room and bedroom. For this reason they\nplaced therein a bed of leaves, a bowl of milk and some nuts. The\ncylinder wheel, on the other hand, she was to use as a play-house, where\nshe could run and climb and swing round.\n\nThe people believed that they had arranged things very comfortably for\nthe lady squirrel, and they were astonished because she didn't seem to\nbe contented; but, instead, she sat there, downcast and moody, in a\ncorner of her room. Every now and again, she would let out a shrill,\nagonised cry. She did not touch the food; and not once did she swing\nround on the wheel. \"It's probably because she's frightened,\" said the\nfarmer folk. \"To-morrow, when she feels more at home, she will both eat\nand play.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the women folk on the farm were making preparations for a\nfeast; and just on that day when the lady squirrel had been captured,\nthey were busy with an elaborate bake. They had had bad luck with\nsomething: either the dough wouldn't rise, or else they had been\ndilatory, for they were obliged to work long after dark.\n\nNaturally there was a great deal of excitement and bustle in the\nkitchen, and probably no one there took time to think about the\nsquirrel, or to wonder how she was getting on. But there was an old\ngrandma in the house who was too aged to take a hand in the baking; this\nshe herself understood, but just the same she did not relish the idea of\nbeing left out of the game. She felt rather downhearted; and for this\nreason she did not go to bed but seated herself by the sitting-room\nwindow and looked out.\n\nThey had opened the kitchen door on account of the heat; and through it\na clear ray of light streamed out on the yard; and it became so well\nlighted out there that the old woman could see all the cracks and holes\nin the plastering on the wall opposite. She also saw the squirrel cage\nwhich hung just where the light fell clearest. And she noticed how the\nsquirrel ran from her room to the wheel, and from the wheel to her room,\nall night long, without stopping an instant. She thought it was a\nstrange sort of unrest that had come over the animal; but she believed,\nof course, that the strong light kept her awake.\n\nBetween the cow-house and the stable there was a broad, handsome\ncarriage-gate; this too came within the light-radius. As the night wore\non, the old grandma saw a tiny creature, no bigger than a hand's\nbreadth, cautiously steal his way through the gate. He was dressed in\nleather breeches and wooden shoes like any other working man. The old\ngrandma knew at once that it was the elf, and she was not the least bit\nfrightened. She had always heard that the elf kept himself somewhere\nabout the place, although she had never seen him before; and an elf, to\nbe sure, brought good luck wherever he appeared.\n\nAs soon as the elf came into the stone-paved yard, he ran right up to\nthe squirrel cage. And since it hung so high that he could not reach it,\nhe went over to the store-house after a rod; placed it against the cage,\nand swung himself up--in the same way that a sailor climbs a rope. When\nhe had reached the cage, he shook the door of the little green house as\nif he wanted to open it; but the old grandma didn't move; for she knew\nthat the children had put a padlock on the door, as they feared that the\nboys on the neighbouring farms would try to steal the squirrel. The old\nwoman saw that when the boy could not get the door open, the lady\nsquirrel came out to the wire wheel. There they held a long conference\ntogether. And when the boy had listened to all that the imprisoned\nanimal had to say to him, he slid down the rod to the ground, and ran\nout through the carriage-gate.\n\nThe old woman didn't expect to see anything more of the elf that night,\nnevertheless, she remained at the window. After a few moments had gone\nby, he returned. He was in such a hurry that it seemed to her as though\nhis feet hardly touched the ground; and he rushed right up to the\nsquirrel cage. The old woman, with her far-sighted eyes, saw him\ndistinctly; and she also saw that he carried something in his hands; but\nwhat it was she couldn't imagine. The thing he carried in his left hand\nhe laid down on the pavement; but that which he held in his right hand\nhe took with him to the cage. He kicked so hard with his wooden shoes on\nthe little window that the glass was broken. He poked in the thing which\nhe held in his hand to the lady squirrel. Then he slid down again, and\ntook up that which he had laid upon the ground, and climbed up to the\ncage with that also. The next instant he ran off again with such haste\nthat the old woman could hardly follow him with her eyes.\n\nBut now it was the old grandma who could no longer sit still in the\ncottage; but who, very slowly, went out to the back yard and stationed\nherself in the shadow of the pump to await the elf's return. And there\nwas one other who had also seen him and had become curious. This was the\nhouse cat. He crept along slyly and stopped close to the wall, just two\nsteps away from the stream of light. They both stood and waited, long\nand patiently, on that chilly March night, and the old woman was just\nbeginning to think about going in again, when she heard a clatter on the\npavement, and saw that the little mite of an elf came trotting along\nonce more, carrying a burden in each hand, as he had done before. That\nwhich he bore squealed and squirmed. And now a light dawned on the old\ngrandma. She understood that the elf had hurried down to the hazel-grove\nand brought back the lady squirrel's babies; and that he was carrying\nthem to her so they shouldn't starve to death.\n\nThe old grandma stood very still, so as not to disturb them; and it did\nnot look as if the elf had noticed her. He was just going to lay one of\nthe babies on the ground so that he could swing himself up to the cage\nwith the other one--when he saw the house cat's green eyes glisten close\nbeside him. He stood there, bewildered, with a young one in each hand.\n\nHe turned around and looked in all directions; then he became aware of\nthe old grandma's presence. Then he did not hesitate long; but walked\nforward, stretched his arms as high as he could reach, for her to take\none of the baby squirrels.\n\nThe old grandma did not wish to prove herself unworthy of the\nconfidence, so she bent down and took the baby squirrel, and stood there\nand held it until the boy had swung himself up to the cage with the\nother one. Then he came back for the one he had entrusted to her care.\n\nThe next morning, when the farm folk had gathered together for\nbreakfast, it was impossible for the old woman to refrain from telling\nthem of what she had seen the night before. They all laughed at her, of\ncourse, and said that she had been only dreaming. There were no baby\nsquirrels this early in the year.\n\nBut she was sure of her ground, and begged them to take a look into the\nsquirrel cage and this they did. And there lay on the bed of leaves,\nfour tiny half-naked, half blind baby squirrels, who were at least a\ncouple of days old.\n\nWhen the farmer himself saw the young ones, he said: \"Be it as it may\nwith this; but one thing is certain, we, on this farm, have behaved in\nsuch a manner that we are shamed before both animals and human beings.\"\nAnd, thereupon, he took the mother squirrel and all her young ones from\nthe cage, and laid them in the old grandma's lap. \"Go thou out to the\nhazel-grove with them,\" said he, \"and let them have their freedom back\nagain!\"\n\nIt was this event that was so much talked about, and which even got into\nthe newspapers, but which the majority would not credit because they\nwere not able to explain how anything like that could have happened.\n\nVITTSK\u00c3\u0096VLE\n\n_Saturday, March twenty-sixth_.\n\nTwo days later, another strange thing happened. A flock of wild geese\ncame flying one morning, and lit on a meadow down in Eastern Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne not\nvery far from Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle manor. In the flock were thirteen wild geese,\nof the usual gray variety, and one white goosey-gander, who carried on\nhis back a tiny lad dressed in yellow leather breeches, green vest, and\na white woollen toboggan hood.\n\nThey were now very near the Eastern sea; and on the meadow where the\ngeese had alighted the soil was sandy, as it usually is on the\nsea-coast. It looked as if, formerly, there had been flying sand in this\nvicinity which had to be held down; for in several directions large,\nplanted pine-woods could be seen.\n\nWhen the wild geese had been feeding a while, several children came\nalong, and walked on the edge of the meadow. The goose who was on guard\nat once raised herself into the air with noisy wing-strokes, so the\nwhole flock should hear that there was danger on foot. All the wild\ngeese flew upward; but the white one trotted along on the ground\nunconcerned. When he saw the others fly he raised his head and called\nafter them: \"You needn't fly away from these! They are only a couple of\nchildren!\"\n\nThe little creature who had been riding on his back, sat down upon a\nknoll on the outskirts of the wood and picked a pine-cone in pieces,\nthat he might get at the seeds. The children were so close to him that\nhe did not dare to run across the meadow to the white one. He concealed\nhimself under a big, dry thistle-leaf, and at the same time gave a\nwarning-cry. But the white one had evidently made up his mind not to let\nhimself be scared. He walked along on the ground all the while; and not\nonce did he look to see in what direction they were going.\n\nMeanwhile, they turned from the path, walked across the field, getting\nnearer and nearer to the goosey-gander. When he finally did look up,\nthey were right upon him. He was so dumfounded, and became so confused,\nhe forgot that he could fly, and tried to get out of their reach by\nrunning. But the children followed, chasing him into a ditch, and there\nthey caught him. The larger of the two stuck him under his arm and\ncarried him off.\n\nWhen the boy, who lay under the thistle-leaf saw this, he sprang up as\nif he wanted to take the goosey-gander away from them; then he must have\nremembered how little and powerless he was, for he threw himself on the\nknoll and beat upon the ground with his clenched fists.\n\nThe goosey-gander cried with all his might for help: \"Thumbietot, come\nand help me! Oh, Thumbietot, come and help me!\" The boy began to laugh\nin the midst of his distress. \"Oh, yes! I'm just the right one to help\nanybody, I am!\" said he.\n\nAnyway he got up and followed the goosey-gander. \"I can't help him,\"\nsaid he, \"but I shall at least find out where they are taking him.\"\n\nThe children had a good start; but the boy had no difficulty in keeping\nthem within sight until they came to a hollow where a brook gushed\nforth. But here he was obliged to run alongside of it for some little\ntime, before he could find a place narrow enough for him to jump over.\n\nWhen he came up from the hollow the children had disappeared. He could\nsee their footprints on a narrow path which led to the woods, and these\nhe continued to follow.\n\nSoon he came to a cross-road. Here the children must have separated, for\nthere were footprints in two directions. The boy looked now as if all\nhope had fled. Then he saw a little white down on a heather-knoll, and\nhe understood that the goosey-gander had dropped this by the wayside to\nlet him know in which direction he had been carried; and therefore he\ncontinued his search. He followed the children through the entire wood.\nThe goosey-gander he did not see; but wherever he was likely to miss his\nway, lay a little white down to put him right.\n\nThe boy continued faithfully to follow the bits of down. They led him\nout of the wood, across a couple of meadows, up on a road, and finally\nthrough the entrance of a broad _all\u00c3\u00a9e_. At the end of the _all\u00c3\u00a9e_ there\nwere gables and towers of red tiling, decorated with bright borders and\nother ornamentations that glittered and shone. When the boy saw that\nthis was some great manor, he thought he knew what had become of the\ngoosey-gander. \"No doubt the children have carried the goosey-gander to\nthe manor and sold him there. By this time he's probably butchered,\" he\nsaid to himself. But he did not seem to be satisfied with anything less\nthan proof positive, and with renewed courage he ran forward. He met no\none in the _all\u00c3\u00a9e_--and that was well, for such as he are generally\nafraid of being seen by human beings.\n\nThe mansion which he came to was a splendid, old-time structure with\nfour great wings which inclosed a courtyard. On the east wing, there was\na high arch leading into the courtyard. This far the boy ran without\nhesitation, but when he got there he stopped. He dared not venture\nfarther, but stood still and pondered what he should do now.\n\nThere he stood, with his finger on his nose, thinking, when he heard\nfootsteps behind him; and as he turned around he saw a whole company\nmarch up the _all\u00c3\u00a9e_. In haste he stole behind a water-barrel which\nstood near the arch, and hid himself.\n\nThose who came up were some twenty young men from a folk-high-school,\nout on a walking tour. They were accompanied by one of the instructors.\nWhen they were come as far as the arch, the teacher requested them to\nwait there a moment, while he went in and asked if they might see the\nold castle of Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle.\n\nThe newcomers were warm and tired; as if they had been on a long tramp.\nOne of them was so thirsty that he went over to the water-barrel and\nstooped down to drink. He had a tin box such as botanists use hanging\nabout his neck. He evidently thought that this was in his way, for he\nthrew it down on the ground. With this, the lid flew open, and one could\nsee that there were a few spring flowers in it.\n\nThe botanist's box dropped just in front of the boy; and he must have\nthought that here was his opportunity to get into the castle and find\nout what had become of the goosey-gander. He smuggled himself quickly\ninto the box and concealed himself as well as he could under the\nanemones and colt's-foot.\n\nHe was hardly hidden before the young man picked the box up, hung it\naround his neck, and slammed down the cover.\n\nThen the teacher came back, and said that they had been given\npermission to enter the castle. At first he conducted them no farther\nthan the courtyard. There he stopped and began to talk to them about\nthis ancient structure.\n\nHe called their attention to the first human beings who had inhabited\nthis country, and who had been obliged to live in mountain-grottoes and\nearth-caves; in the dens of wild beasts, and in the brushwood; and that\na very long period had elapsed before they learned to build themselves\nhuts from the trunks of trees. And afterward how long had they not been\nforced to labour and struggle, before they had advanced from the log\ncabin, with its single room, to the building of a castle with a hundred\nrooms--like Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle!\n\nIt was about three hundred and fifty years ago that the rich and\npowerful built such castles for themselves, he said. It was very evident\nthat Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle had been erected at a time when wars and robbers made it\nunsafe in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. All around the castle was a deep trench filled with\nwater; and across this there had been a bridge in bygone days that could\nbe hoisted up. Over the gate-arch there is, even to this day, a\nwatch-tower; and all along the sides of the castle ran sentry-galleries,\nand in the corners stood towers with walls a metre thick. Yet the castle\nhad not been erected in the most savage war time; for Jens Brahe, who\nbuilt it, had also studied to make of it a beautiful and decorative\nornament. If they could see the big, solid stone structure at Glimminge,\nwhich had been built only a generation earlier, they would readily see\nthat Jans Holgersen Ulfstand, the builder, hadn't figured upon anything\nelse--only to build big and strong and secure, without bestowing a\nthought upon making it beautiful and comfortable. If they visited such\ncastles as Marsvinsholm, Snogeholm and \u00c3\u0096vid's Cloister--which were\nerected a hundred years or so later--they would find that the times had\nbecome less warlike. The gentlemen who built these places, had not\nfurnished them with fortifications; but had only taken pains to provide\nthemselves with great, splendid dwelling houses.\n\nThe teacher talked at length--and in detail; and the boy who lay shut up\nin the box was pretty impatient; but he must have lain very still, for\nthe owner of the box hadn't the least suspicion that he was carrying him\nalong.\n\nFinally the company went into the castle. But if the boy had hoped for\na chance to crawl out of that box, he was deceived; for the student\ncarried it upon him all the while, and the boy was obliged to accompany\nhim through all the rooms. It was a tedious tramp. The teacher stopped\nevery other minute to explain and instruct.\n\nIn one room he found an old fireplace, and before this he stopped to\ntalk about the different kinds of fireplaces that had been used in the\ncourse of time. The first indoors fireplace had been a big, flat stone\non the floor of the hut, with an opening in the roof which let in both\nwind and rain. The next had been a big stone hearth with no opening in\nthe roof. This must have made the hut very warm, but it also filled it\nwith soot and smoke. When Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle was built, the people had advanced\nfar enough to open the fireplace, which, at that time, had a wide\nchimney for the smoke; but it also took most of the warmth up in the air\nwith it.\n\nIf that boy had ever in his life been cross and impatient, he was given\na good lesson in patience that day. It must have been a whole hour now\nthat he had lain perfectly still.\n\nIn the next room they came to, the teacher stopped before an old-time\nbed with its high canopy and rich curtains. Immediately he began to talk\nabout the beds and bed places of olden days.\n\nThe teacher didn't hurry himself; but then he did not know, of course,\nthat a poor little creature lay shut up in a botanist's box, and only\nwaited for him to get through. When they came to a room with gilded\nleather hangings, he talked to them about how the people had dressed\ntheir walls and ceilings ever since the beginning of time. And when he\ncame to an old family portrait, he told them all about the different\nchanges in dress. And in the banquet halls he described ancient customs\nof celebrating weddings and funerals.\n\nThereupon, the teacher talked a little about the excellent men and women\nwho had lived in the castle; about the old Brahes, and the old\nBarnekows; of Christian Barnekow, who had given his horse to the king to\nhelp him escape; of Margareta Ascheberg who had been married to Kjell\nBarnekow and who, when a widow, had managed the estates and the whole\ndistrict for fifty-three years; of banker Hageman, a farmer's son from\nVittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle, who had grown so rich that he had bought the entire estate;\nabout the Stjernsv\u00c3\u00a4rds, who had given the people of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne better\nploughs, which enabled them to discard the ridiculous old wooden ploughs\nthat three oxen were hardly able to drag. During all this, the boy lay\nstill. If he had ever been mischievous and shut the cellar door on his\nfather or mother, he understood now how they had felt; for it was hours\nand hours before that teacher got through.\n\nAt last the teacher went out into the courtyard again. And there he\ndiscoursed upon the tireless labour of mankind to procure for themselves\ntools and weapons, clothes and houses and ornaments. He said that such\nan old castle as Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle was a mile-post on time's highway. Here one\ncould see how far the people had advanced three hundred and fifty years\nago; and one could judge for oneself whether things had gone forward or\nbackward since their time.\n\nBut this dissertation the boy escaped hearing; for the student who\ncarried him was thirsty again, and stole into the kitchen to ask for a\ndrink of water. When the boy was carried into the kitchen, he should\nhave tried to look around for the goosey-gander. He had begun to move;\nand as he did this, he happened to press too hard against the lid--and\nit flew open. As botanists' box-lids are always flying open, the student\nthought no more about the matter but pressed it down again. Then the\ncook asked him if he had a snake in the box.\n\n\"No, I have only a few plants,\" the student replied. \"It was certainly\nsomething that moved there,\" insisted the cook. The student threw back\nthe lid to show her that she was mistaken. \"See for yourself--if--\"\n\nBut he got no further, for now the boy dared not stay in the box any\nlonger, but with one bound he stood on the floor, and out he rushed.\nThe maids hardly had time to see what it was that ran, but they hurried\nafter it, nevertheless.\n\nThe teacher still stood and talked when he was interrupted by shrill\ncries. \"Catch him, catch him!\" shrieked those who had come from the\nkitchen; and all the young men raced after the boy, who glided away\nfaster than a rat. They tried to intercept him at the gate, but it was\nnot so easy to get a hold on such a little creature, so, luckily, he got\nout in the open.\n\nThe boy did not dare to run down toward the open _all\u00c3\u00a9e,_ but turned in\nanother direction. He rushed through the garden into the back yard. All\nthe while the people raced after him, shrieking and laughing. The poor\nlittle thing ran as hard as ever he could to get out of their way; but\nstill it looked as though the people would catch up with him.\n\nAs he rushed past a labourer's cottage, he heard a goose cackle, and saw\na white down lying on the doorstep. There, at last, was the\ngoosey-gander! He had been on the wrong track before. He thought no more\nof housemaids and men, who were hounding him, but climbed up the\nsteps--and into the hallway. Farther he couldn't come, for the door was\nlocked. He heard how the goosey-gander cried and moaned inside, but he\ncouldn't get the door open. The hunters that were pursuing him came\nnearer and nearer, and, in the room, the goosey-gander cried more and\nmore pitifully. In this direst of needs the boy finally plucked up\ncourage and pounded on the door with all his might.\n\nA child opened it, and the boy looked into the room. In the middle of\nthe floor sat a woman who held the goosey-gander tight to clip his\nquill-feathers. It was her children who had found him, and she didn't\nwant to do him any harm. It was her intention to let him in among her\nown geese, had she only succeeded in clipping his wings so he couldn't\nfly away. But a worse fate could hardly have happened to the\ngoosey-gander, and he shrieked and moaned with all his might.\n\nAnd a lucky thing it was that the woman hadn't started the clipping\nsooner. Now only two quills had fallen under the shears' when the door\nwas opened--and the boy stood on the door-sill. But a creature like\nthat the woman had never seen before. She couldn't believe anything else\nbut that it was Goa-Nisse himself; and in her terror she dropped the\nshears, clasped her hands--and forgot to hold on to the goosey-gander.\n\nAs soon as he felt himself freed, he ran toward the door. He didn't give\nhimself time to stop; but, as he ran past him, he grabbed the boy by the\nneck-band and carried him along with him. On the stoop he spread his\nwings and flew up in the air; at the same time he made a graceful sweep\nwith his neck and seated the boy on his smooth, downy back.\n\nAnd off they flew--while all Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle stood and stared after them.\n\nIN \u00c3\u0096VID CLOISTER PARK\n\nAll that day, when the wild geese played with the fox, the boy lay and\nslept in a deserted squirrel nest. When he awoke, along toward evening,\nhe felt very uneasy. \"Well, now I shall soon be sent home again! Then\nI'll have to exhibit myself before father and mother,\" thought he. But\nwhen he looked up and saw the wild geese, who lay and bathed in Vomb\nLake--not one of them said a word about his going. \"They probably think\nthe white one is too tired to travel home with me to-night,\" thought the\nboy.\n\nThe next morning the geese were awake at daybreak, long before sunrise.\nNow the boy felt sure that he'd have to go home; but, curiously enough,\nboth he and the white goosey-gander were permitted to follow the wild\nones on their morning tour. The boy couldn't comprehend the reason for\nthe delay, but he figured it out in this way, that the wild geese did\nnot care to send the goosey-gander on such a long journey until they had\nboth eaten their fill. Come what might, he was only glad for every\nmoment that should pass before he must face his parents.\n\nThe wild geese travelled over \u00c3\u0096vid's Cloister estate which was situated\nin a beautiful park east of the lake, and looked very imposing with its\ngreat castle; its well planned court surrounded by low walls and\npavilions; its fine old-time garden with covered arbours, streams and\nfountains; its wonderful trees, trimmed bushes, and its evenly mown\nlawns with their beds of beautiful spring flowers.\n\nWhen the wild geese rode over the estate in the early morning hour there\nwas no human being about. When they had carefully assured themselves of\nthis, they lowered themselves toward the dog kennel, and shouted: \"What\nkind of a little hut is this? What kind of a little hut is this?\"\n\nInstantly the dog came out of his kennel--furiously angry--and barked at\nthe air.\n\n\"Do you call this a hut, you tramps! Can't you see that this is a great\nstone castle? Can't you see what fine terraces, and what a lot of pretty\nwalls and windows and great doors it has, bow, wow, wow, wow? Don't you\nsee the grounds, can't you see the garden, can't you see the\nconservatories, can't you see the marble statues? You call this a hut,\ndo you? Do huts have parks with beech-groves and hazel-bushes and\ntrailing vines and oak trees and firs and hunting-grounds filled with\ngame, wow, wow, wow? Do you call this a hut? Have you seen huts with so\nmany outhouses around them that they look like a whole village? You must\nknow of a lot of huts that have their own church and their own\nparsonage; and that rule over the district and the peasant homes and the\nneighbouring farms and barracks, wow, wow, wow? Do you call this a hut?\nTo this hut belong the richest possessions in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, you beggars! You\ncan't see a bit of land, from where you hang in the clouds, that does\nnot obey commands from this hut, wow, wow, wow!\"\n\nAll this the dog managed to cry out in one breath; and the wild geese\nflew back and forth over the estate, and listened to him until he was\nwinded. But then they cried: \"What are you so mad about? We didn't ask\nabout the castle; we only wanted to know about your kennel, stupid!\"\n\nWhen the boy heard this joke, he laughed; then a thought stole in on him\nwhich at once made him serious. \"Think how many of these amusing things\nyou would hear, if you could go with the wild geese through the whole\ncountry, all the way up to Lapland!\" said he to himself. \"And just now,\nwhen you are in such a bad fix, a trip like that would be the best thing\nyou could hit upon.\"\n\nThe wild geese travelled to one of the wide fields, east of the estate,\nto eat grass-roots, and they kept this up for hours. In the meantime,\nthe boy wandered in the great park which bordered the field. He hunted\nup a beech-nut grove and began to look up at the bushes, to see if a\nnut from last fall still hung there. But again and again the thought of\nthe trip came over him, as he walked in the park. He pictured to himself\nwhat a fine time he would have if he went with the wild geese. To freeze\nand starve: that he believed he should have to do often enough; but as a\nrecompense, he would escape both work and study.\n\nAs he walked there, the old gray leader-goose came up to him, and asked\nif he had found anything eatable. No, that he hadn't, he replied, and\nthen she tried to help him. She couldn't find any nuts either, but she\ndiscovered a couple of dried blossoms that hung on a brier-bush. These\nthe boy ate with a good relish. But he wondered what mother would say,\nif she knew that he had lived on raw fish and old winter-dried blossoms.\n\nWhen the wild geese had finally eaten themselves full, they bore off\ntoward the lake again, where they amused themselves with games until\nalmost dinner time.\n\nThe wild geese challenged the white goosey-gander to take part in all\nkinds of sports. They had swimming races, running races, and flying\nraces with him. The big tame one did his level best to hold his own, but\nthe clever wild geese beat him every time. All the while, the boy sat on\nthe goosey-gander's back and encouraged him, and had as much fun as the\nrest. They laughed and screamed and cackled, and it was remarkable that\nthe people on the estate didn't hear them.\n\nWhen the wild geese were tired of play, they flew out on the ice and\nrested for a couple of hours. The afternoon they spent in pretty much\nthe same way as the forenoon. First, a couple of hours feeding, then\nbathing and play in the water near the ice-edge until sunset, when they\nimmediately arranged themselves for sleep.\n\n\"This is just the life that suits me,\" thought the boy when he crept in\nunder the gander's wing. \"But to-morrow, I suppose I'll be sent home.\"\n\nBefore he fell asleep, he lay and thought that if he might go along with\nthe wild geese, he would escape all scoldings because he was lazy. Then\nhe could cut loose every day, and his only worry would be to get\nsomething to eat. But he needed so little nowadays; and there would\nalways be a way to get that.\n\nSo he pictured the whole scene to himself; what he should see, and all\nthe adventures that he would be in on. Yes, it would be something\ndifferent from the wear and tear at home. \"If I could only go with the\nwild geese on their travels, I shouldn't grieve because I'd been\ntransformed,\" thought the boy.\n\nHe wasn't afraid of anything--except being sent home; but not even on\nWednesday did the geese say anything to him about going. That day passed\nin the same way as Tuesday; and the boy grew more and more contented\nwith the outdoor life. He thought that he had the lovely \u00c3\u0096vid Cloister\npark--which was as large as a forest--all to himself; and he wasn't\nanxious to go back to the stuffy cabin and the little patch of ground\nthere at home.\n\nOn Wednesday he believed that the wild geese thought of keeping him with\nthem; but on Thursday he lost hope again.\n\nThursday began just like the other days; the geese fed on the broad\nmeadows, and the boy hunted for food in the park. After a while Akka\ncame to him, and asked if he had found anything to eat. No, he had not;\nand then she looked up a dry caraway herb, that had kept all its tiny\nseeds intact.\n\nWhen the boy had eaten, Akka said that she thought he ran around in the\npark altogether too recklessly. She wondered if he knew how many enemies\nhe had to guard against--he, who was so little. No, he didn't know\nanything at all about that. Then Akka began to enumerate them for him.\n\nWhenever he walked in the park, she said, that he must look out for the\nfox and the marten; when he came to the shores of the lake, he must\nthink of the otters; as he sat on the stone wall, he must not forget the\nweasels, who could creep through the smallest holes; and if he wished to\nlie down and sleep on a pile of leaves, he must first find out if the\nadders were not sleeping their winter sleep in the same pile. As soon as\nhe came out in the open fields, he should keep an eye out for hawks and\nbuzzards; for eagles and falcons that soared in the air. In the\nbramble-bush he could be captured by the sparrow-hawks; magpies and\ncrows were found everywhere and in these he mustn't place any too much\nconfidence. As soon as it was dusk, he must keep his ears open and\nlisten for the big owls, who flew along with such soundless wing-strokes\nthat they could come right up to him before he was aware of their\npresence.\n\nWhen the boy heard that there were so many who were after his life, he\nthought that it would be simply impossible for him to escape. He was not\nparticularly afraid to die, but he didn't like the idea of being eaten\nup, so he asked Akka what he should do to protect himself from the\ncarnivorous animals.\n\nAkka answered at once that the boy should try to get on good terms with\nall the small animals in the woods and fields: with the squirrel-folk,\nand the hare-family; with bullfinches and the titmice and woodpeckers\nand larks. If he made friends with them, they could warn him against\ndangers, find hiding places for him, and protect him.\n\nBut later in the day, when the boy tried to profit by this counsel, and\nturned to Sirle Squirrel to ask for his protection, it was evident that\nhe did not care to help him. \"You surely can't expect anything from me,\nor the rest of the small animals!\" said Sirle. \"Don't you think we know\nthat you are Nils the goose boy, who tore down the swallow's nest last\nyear, crushed the starling's eggs, threw baby crows in the marl-ditch,\ncaught thrushes in snares, and put squirrels in cages? You just help\nyourself as well as you can; and you may be thankful that we do not form\na league against you, and drive you back to your own kind!\"\n\nThis was just the sort of answer the boy would not have let go\nunpunished, in the days when he was Nils the goose boy. But now he was\nonly fearful lest the wild geese, too, had found out how wicked he could\nbe. He had been so anxious for fear he wouldn't be permitted to stay\nwith the wild geese, that he hadn't dared to get into the least little\nmischief since he joined their company. It was true that he didn't have\nthe power to do much harm now, but, little as he was, he could have\ndestroyed many birds' nests, and crushed many eggs, if he'd been in a\nmind to. Now he had been good. He hadn't pulled a feather from a\ngoose-wing, or given anyone a rude answer; and every morning when he\ncalled upon Akka he had always removed his cap and bowed.\n\nAll day Thursday he thought it was surely on account of his wickedness\nthat the wild geese did not care to take him along up to Lapland. And in\nthe evening, when he heard that Sirle Squirrel's wife had been stolen,\nand her children were starving to death, he made up his mind to help\nthem. And we have already been told how well he succeeded.\n\nWhen the boy came into the park on Friday, he heard the bulfinches sing\nin every bush, of how Sirle Squirrel's wife had been carried away from\nher children by cruel robbers, and how Nils, the goose boy, had risked\nhis life among human beings, and taken the little squirrel children to\nher.\n\n\"And who is so honoured in \u00c3\u0096vid Cloister park now, as Thumbietot!\" sang\nthe bullfinch; \"he, whom all feared when he was Nils the goose boy?\nSirle Squirrel will give him nuts; the poor hares are going to play with\nhim; the small wild animals will carry him on their backs, and fly away\nwith him when Smirre Fox approaches. The titmice are going to warn him\nagainst the hawk, and the finches and larks will sing of his valour.\"\n\nThe boy was absolutely certain that both Akka and the wild geese had\nheard all this. But still Friday passed and not one word did they say\nabout his remaining with them.\n\nUntil Saturday the wild geese fed in the fields around \u00c3\u0096vid, undisturbed\nby Smirre Fox.\n\nBut on Saturday morning, when they came out in the meadows, he lay in\nwait for them, and chased them from one field to another, and they were\nnot allowed to eat in peace. When Akka understood that he didn't intend\nto leave them in peace, she came to a decision quickly, raised herself\ninto the air and flew with her flock several miles away, over F\u00c3\u00a4rs'\nplains and Linder\u00c3\u00b6dsosen's hills. They did not stop before they had\narrived in the district of Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle.\n\nBut at Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle the goosey-gander was stolen, and how it happened has\nalready been related. If the boy had not used all his powers to help him\nhe would never again have been found.\n\nOn Saturday evening, as the boy came back to Vomb Lake with the\ngoosey-gander, he thought that he had done a good day's work; and he\nspeculated a good deal on what Akka and the wild geese would say to him.\nThe wild geese were not at all sparing in their praises, but they did\nnot say the word he was longing to hear.\n\nThen Sunday came again. A whole week had gone by since the boy had been\nbewitched, and he was still just as little.\n\nBut he didn't appear to be giving himself any extra worry on account of\nthis thing. On Sunday afternoon he sat huddled together in a big, fluffy\nosier-bush, down by the lake, and blew on a reed-pipe. All around him\nthere sat as many finches and bullfinches and starlings as the bush\ncould well hold--who sang songs which he tried to teach himself to play.\nBut the boy was not at home in this art. He blew so false that the\nfeathers raised themselves on the little music-masters and they shrieked\nand fluttered in their despair. The boy laughed so heartily at their\nexcitement, that he dropped his pipe.\n\nHe began once again, and that went just as badly. Then all the little\nbirds wailed: \"To-day you play worse than usual, Thumbietot! You don't\ntake one true note! Where are your thoughts, Thumbietot?\"\n\n\"They are elsewhere,\" said the boy--and this was true. He sat there and\npondered how long he would be allowed to remain with the wild geese; or\nif he should be sent home perhaps to-day.\n\nFinally the boy threw down his pipe and jumped from the bush. He had\nseen Akka, and all the wild geese, coming toward him in a long row. They\nwalked so uncommonly slow and dignified-like, that the boy immediately\nunderstood that now he should learn what they intended to do with him.\n\nWhen they stopped at last, Akka said: \"You may well have reason to\nwonder at me, Thumbietot, who have not said thanks to you for saving me\nfrom Smirre Fox. But I am one of those who would rather give thanks by\ndeeds than words. I have sent word to the elf that bewitched you. At\nfirst he didn't want to hear anything about curing you; but I have sent\nmessage upon message to him, and told him how well you have conducted\nyourself among us. He greets you, and says, that as soon as you turn\nback home, you shall be human again.\"\n\nBut think of it! Just as happy as the boy had been when the wild geese\nbegan to speak, just that miserable was he when they had finished. He\ndidn't say a word, but turned away and wept.\n\n\"What in all the world is this?\" said Akka. \"It looks as though you had\nexpected more of me than I have offered you.\"\n\nBut the boy was thinking of the care-free days and the banter; and of\nadventure and freedom and travel, high above the earth, that he should\nmiss, and he actually bawled with grief. \"I don't want to be human,\"\nsaid he. \"I want to go with you to Lapland.\" \"I'll tell you something,\"\nsaid Akka. \"That elf is very touchy, and I'm afraid that if you do not\naccept his offer now, it will be difficult for you to coax him another\ntime.\"\n\nIt was a strange thing about that boy--as long as he had lived, he had\nnever cared for anyone. He had not cared for his father or mother; not\nfor the school teacher; not for his school-mates; nor for the boys in\nthe neighbourhood. All that they had wished to have him do--whether it\nhad been work or play--he had only thought tiresome. Therefore there was\nno one whom he missed or longed for.\n\nThe only ones that he had come anywhere near agreeing with, were Osa,\nthe goose girl, and little Mats--a couple of children who had tended\ngeese in the fields, like himself. But he didn't care particularly for\nthem either. No, far from it! \"I don't want to be human,\" bawled the\nboy. \"I want to go with you to Lapland. That's why I've been good for a\nwhole week!\" \"I don't want to forbid you to come along with us as far as\nyou like,\" said Akka, \"but think first if you wouldn't rather go home\nagain. A day may come when you will regret this.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the boy, \"that's nothing to regret. I have never been as well\noff as here with you.\"\n\n\"Well then, let it be as you wish,\" said Akka.\n\n\"Thanks!\" said the boy, and he felt so happy that he had to cry for very\njoy--just as he had cried before from sorrow.\n\n\nGLIMMINGE CASTLE\n\n\nBLACK RATS AND GRAY RATS\n\nIn south-eastern Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne--not far from the sea there is an old castle\ncalled Glimminge. It is a big and substantial stone house; and can be\nseen over the plain for miles around. It is not more than four stories\nhigh; but it is so ponderous that an ordinary farmhouse, which stands on\nthe same estate, looks like a little children's playhouse in comparison.\n\nThe big stone house has such thick ceilings and partitions that there is\nscarcely room in its interior for anything but the thick walls. The\nstairs are narrow, the entrances small; and the rooms few. That the\nwalls might retain their strength, there are only the fewest number of\nwindows in the upper stories, and none at all are found in the lower\nones. In the old war times, the people were just as glad that they could\nshut themselves up in a strong and massive house like this, as one is\nnowadays to be able to creep into furs in a snapping cold winter. But\nwhen the time of peace came, they did not care to live in the dark and\ncold stone halls of the old castle any longer. They have long since\ndeserted the big Glimminge castle, and moved into dwelling places where\nthe light and air can penetrate.\n\nAt the time when Nils Holgersson wandered around with the wild geese,\nthere were no human beings in Glimminge castle; but for all that, it was\nnot without inhabitants. Every summer there lived a stork couple in a\nlarge nest on the roof. In a nest in the attic lived a pair of gray\nowls; in the secret passages hung bats; in the kitchen oven lived an old\ncat; and down in the cellar there were hundreds of old black rats.\n\nRats are not held in very high esteem by other animals; but the black\nrats at Glimminge castle were an exception. They were always mentioned\nwith respect, because they had shown great valour in battle with their\nenemies; and much endurance under the great misfortunes which had\nbefallen their kind. They nominally belong to a rat-folk who, at one\ntime, had been very numerous and powerful, but who were now dying out.\nDuring a long period of time, the black rats owned Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne and the whole\ncountry. They were found in every cellar; in every attic; in larders and\ncowhouses and barns; in breweries and flour-mills; in churches and\ncastles; in every man-constructed building. But now they were banished\nfrom all this--and were almost exterminated. Only in one and another old\nand secluded place could one run across a few of them; and nowhere were\nthey to be found in such large numbers as in Glimminge castle.\n\nWhen an animal folk die out, it is generally the human kind who are the\ncause of it; but that was not the case in this instance. The people had\ncertainly struggled with the black rats, but they had not been able to\ndo them any harm worth mentioning. Those who had conquered them were an\nanimal folk of their own kind, who were called gray rats.\n\nThese gray rats had not lived in the land since time immemorial, like\nthe black rats, but descended from a couple of poor immigrants who\nlanded in Malm\u00c3\u00b6 from a Libyan sloop about a hundred years ago. They were\nhomeless, starved-out wretches who stuck close to the harbour, swam\namong the piles under the bridges, and ate refuse that was thrown in the\nwater. They never ventured into the city, which was owned by the black\nrats.\n\nBut gradually, as the gray rats increased in number they grew bolder.\nAt first they moved over to some waste places and condemned old houses\nwhich the black rats had abandoned. They hunted their food in gutters\nand dirt heaps, and made the most of all the rubbish that the black rats\ndid not deign to take care of. They were hardy, contented and fearless;\nand within a few years they had become so powerful that they undertook\nto drive the black rats out of Malm\u00c3\u00b6. They took from them attics,\ncellars and storerooms, starved them out or bit them to death for they\nwere not at all afraid of fighting.\n\nWhen Malm\u00c3\u00b6 was captured, they marched forward in small and large\ncompanies to conquer the whole country. It is almost impossible to\ncomprehend why the black rats did not muster themselves into a great,\nunited war-expedition to exterminate the gray rats, while these were\nstill few in numbers. But the black rats were so certain of their power\nthat they could not believe it possible for them to lose it. They sat\nstill on their estates, and in the meantime the gray rats took from them\nfarm after farm, city after city. They were starved out, forced out,\nrooted out. In Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne they had not been able to maintain themselves in a\nsingle place except Glimminge castle.\n\nThe old castle had such secure walls and such few rat passages led\nthrough these, that the black rats had managed to protect themselves,\nand to prevent the gray rats from crowding in. Night after night, year\nafter year, the struggle had continued between the aggressors and the\ndefenders; but the black rats had kept faithful watch, and had fought\nwith the utmost contempt for death, and, thanks to the fine old house,\nthey had always conquered.\n\nIt will have to be acknowledged that as long as the black rats were in\npower they were as much shunned by all other living creatures as the\ngray rats are in our day--and for just cause; they had thrown themselves\nupon poor, fettered prisoners, and tortured them; they had ravished the\ndead; they had stolen the last turnip from the cellars of the poor;\nbitten off the feet of sleeping geese; robbed eggs and chicks from the\nhens; and committed a thousand depredations. But since they had come to\ngrief, all this seemed to have been forgotten; and no one could help but\nmarvel at the last of a race that had held out so long against its\nenemies.\n\nThe gray rats that lived in the courtyard at Glimminge and in the\nvicinity, kept up a continuous warfare and tried to watch out for every\npossible chance to capture the castle. One would fancy that they should\nhave allowed the little company of black rats to occupy Glimminge castle\nin peace, since they themselves had acquired all the rest of the\ncountry; but you may be sure this thought never occurred to them. They\nwere wont to say that it was a point of honour with them to conquer the\nblack rats at some time or other. But those who were acquainted with the\ngray rats must have known that it was because the human kind used\nGlimminge castle as a grain store-house that the gray ones could not\nrest before they had taken possession of the place.\n\nTHE STORK\n\n_Monday, March twenty-eighth_.\n\nEarly one morning the wild geese who stood and slept on the ice in Vomb\nLake were awakened by long calls from the air. \"Trirop, Trirop!\" it\nsounded, \"Trianut, the crane, sends greetings to Akka, the wild goose,\nand her flock. To-morrow will be the day of the great crane dance on\nKullaberg.\"\n\nAkka raised her head and answered at once: \"Greetings and thanks!\nGreetings and thanks!\"\n\nWith that, the cranes flew farther; and the wild geese heard them for a\nlong while--where they travelled and called out over every field, and\nevery wooded hill: \"Trianut sends greetings. To-morrow will be the day\nof the great crane dance on Kullaberg.\"\n\nThe wild geese were very happy over this invitation. \"You're in luck,\"\nthey said to the white goosey-gander, \"to be permitted to attend the\ngreat crane dance on Kullaberg!\" \"Is it then so remarkable to see cranes\ndance?\" asked the goosey-gander. \"It is something that you have never\neven dreamed about!\" replied the wild geese.\n\n\"Now we must think out what we shall do with Thumbietot to-morrow--so\nthat no harm can come to him, while we run over to Kullaberg,\" said\nAkka. \"Thumbietot shall not be left alone!\" said the goosey-gander. \"If\nthe cranes won't let him see their dance, then I'll stay with him.\"\n\n\"No human being has ever been permitted to attend the Animal's Congress,\nat Kullaberg,\" said Akka, \"and I shouldn't dare to take Thumbietot\nalong. But we'll discuss this more at length later in the day. Now we\nmust first and foremost think about getting something to eat.\"\n\nWith that Akka gave the signal to adjourn. On this day she also sought\nher feeding-place a good distance away, on Smirre Fox's account, and she\ndidn't alight until she came to the swampy meadows a little south of\nGlimminge castle.\n\nAll that day the boy sat on the shores of a little pond, and blew on\nreed-pipes. He was out of sorts because he shouldn't see the crane\ndance, and he just couldn't say a word, either to the goosey-gander, or\nto any of the others.\n\nIt was pretty hard that Akka should still doubt him. When a boy had\ngiven up being human, just to travel around with a few wild geese, they\nsurely ought to understand that he had no desire to betray them. Then,\ntoo, they ought to understand that when he had renounced so much to\nfollow them, it was their duty to let him see all the wonders they could\nshow him.\n\n\"I'll have to speak my mind right out to them,\" thought he. But hour\nafter hour passed, still he hadn't come round to it. It may sound\nremarkable--but the boy had actually acquired a kind of respect for the\nold leader-goose. He felt that it was not easy to pit his will against\nhers.\n\nOn one side of the swampy meadow, where the wild geese fed, there was a\nbroad stone hedge. Toward evening when the boy finally raised his head,\nto speak to Akka, his glance happened to rest on this hedge. He uttered\na little cry of surprise, and all the wild geese instantly looked up,\nand stared in the same direction. At first, both the geese and the boy\nthought that all the round, gray stones in the hedge had acquired legs,\nand were starting on a run; but soon they saw that it was a company of\nrats who ran over it. They moved very rapidly, and ran forward, tightly\npacked, line upon line, and were so numerous that, for some time, they\ncovered the entire stone hedge.\n\nThe boy had been afraid of rats, even when he was a big, strong human\nbeing. Then what must his feelings be now, when he was so tiny that two\nor three of them could overpower him? One shudder after another\ntravelled down his spinal column as he stood and stared at them.\n\nBut strangely enough, the wild geese seemed to feel the same aversion\ntoward the rats that he did. They did not speak to them; and when they\nwere gone, they shook themselves as if their feathers had been\nmud-spattered.\n\n\"Such a lot of gray rats abroad!\" said Iksi from Vassipaure. \"That's not\na good omen.\"\n\nThe boy intended to take advantage of this opportunity to say to Akka\nthat he thought she ought to let him go with them to Kullaberg, but he\nwas prevented anew, for all of a sudden a big bird came down in the\nmidst of the geese.\n\nOne could believe, when one looked at this bird, that he had borrowed\nbody, neck and head from a little white goose. But in addition to this,\nhe had procured for himself large black wings, long red legs, and a\nthick bill, which was too large for the little head, and weighed it down\nuntil it gave him a sad and worried look.\n\nAkka at once straightened out the folds of her wings, and curtsied many\ntimes as she approached the stork. She wasn't specially surprised to see\nhim in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne so early in the spring, because she knew that the male\nstorks are in the habit of coming in good season to take a look at the\nnest, and see that it hasn't been damaged during the winter, before the\nfemale storks go to the trouble of flying over the East sea. But she\nwondered very much what it might signify that he sought her out, since\nstorks prefer to associate with members of their own family.\n\n\"I can hardly believe that there is anything wrong with your house, Herr\nErmenrich,\" said Akka.\n\nIt was apparent now that it is true what they say: a stork can seldom\nopen his bill without complaining. But what made the thing he said sound\neven more doleful was that it was difficult for him to speak out. He\nstood for a long time and only clattered with his bill; afterward he\nspoke in a hoarse and feeble voice. He complained about everything: the\nnest--which was situated at the very top of the roof-tree at Glimminge\ncastle--had been totally destroyed by winter storms; and no food could\nhe get any more in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. The people of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne were appropriating all his\npossessions. They dug out his marshes and laid waste his swamps. He\nintended to move away from this country, and never return to it again.\n\nWhile the stork grumbled, Akka, the wild goose who had neither home nor\nprotection, could not help thinking to herself: \"If I had things as\ncomfortable as you have, Herr Ermenrich, I should be above complaining.\nYou have remained a free and wild bird; and still you stand so well with\nhuman beings that no one will fire a shot at you, or steal an egg from\nyour nest.\" But all this she kept to herself. To the stork she only\nremarked, that she couldn't believe he would be willing to move from a\nhouse where storks had resided ever since it was built.\n\nThen the stork suddenly asked the geese if they had seen the gray rats\nwho were marching toward Glimminge castle. When Akka replied that she\nhad seen the horrid creatures, he began to tell her about the brave\nblack rats who, for years, had defended the castle. \"But this night\nGlimminge castle will fall into the gray rats' power,\" sighed the stork.\n\n\"And why just this night, Herr Ermenrich?\" asked Akka.\n\n\"Well, because nearly all the black rats went over to Kullaberg last\nnight,\" said the stork, \"since they had counted on all the rest of the\nanimals also hurrying there. But you see that the gray rats have stayed\nat home; and now they are mustering to storm the castle to-night, when\nit will be defended by only a few old creatures who are too feeble to go\nover to Kullaberg. They'll probably accomplish their purpose. But I have\nlived here in harmony with the black rats for so many years, that it\ndoes not please me to live in a place inhabited by their enemies.\"\n\nAkka understood now that the stork had become so enraged over the gray\nrats' mode of action, that he had sought her out as an excuse to\ncomplain about them. But after the manner of storks, he certainly had\ndone nothing to avert the disaster. \"Have you sent word to the black\nrats, Herr Ermenrich?\" she asked. \"No,\" replied the stork, \"that\nwouldn't be of any use. Before they can get back, the castle will be\ntaken.\" \"You mustn't be so sure of that, Herr Ermenrich,\" said Akka. \"I\nknow an old wild goose, I do, who will gladly prevent outrages of this\nkind.\"\n\nWhen Akka said this, the stork raised his head and stared at her. And it\nwas not surprising, for Akka had neither claws nor bill that were fit\nfor fighting; and, in the bargain, she was a day bird, and as soon as it\ngrew dark she fell helplessly asleep, while the rats did their fighting\nat night.\n\nBut Akka had evidently made up her mind to help the black rats. She\ncalled Iksi from Vassijaure, and ordered him to take the wild geese over\nto Vonib Lake; and when the geese made excuses, she said\nauthoritatively: \"I believe it will be best for us all that you obey me.\nI must fly over to the big stone house, and if you follow me, the people\non the place will be sure to see us, and shoot us down. The only one\nthat I want to take with me on this trip is Thumbietot. He can be of\ngreat service to me because he has good eyes, and can keep awake at\nnight.\"\n\nThe boy was in his most contrary mood that day. And when he heard what\nAkka said, he raised himself to his full height and stepped forward, his\nhands behind him and his nose in the air, and he intended to say that\nhe, most assuredly, did not wish to take a hand in the fight with gray\nrats. She might look around for assistance elsewhere.\n\nBut the instant the boy was seen, the stork began to move. He had stood\nbefore, as storks generally stand, with head bent downward and the bill\npressed against the neck. But now a gurgle was heard deep down in his\nwindpipe; as though he would have laughed. Quick as a flash, he lowered\nthe bill, grabbed the boy, and tossed him a couple of metres in the\nair. This feat he performed seven times, while the boy shrieked and the\ngeese shouted: \"What are you trying to do, Herr Ermenrich? That's not a\nfrog. That's a human being, Herr Ermenrich.\"\n\nFinally the stork put the boy down entirely unhurt. Thereupon he said to\nAkka, \"I'll fly back to Glimminge castle now, mother Akka. All who live\nthere were very much worried when I left. You may be sure they'll be\nvery glad when I tell them that Akka, the wild goose, and Thumbietot,\nthe human elf, are on their way to rescue them.\" With that the stork\ncraned his neck, raised his wings, and darted off like an arrow when it\nleaves a well-drawn bow. Akka understood that he was making fun of her,\nbut she didn't let it bother her. She waited until the boy had found his\nwooden shoes, which the stork had shaken off; then she put him on her\nback and followed the stork. On his own account, the boy made no\nobjection, and said not a word about not wanting to go along. He had\nbecome so furious with the stork, that he actually sat and puffed. That\nlong, red-legged thing believed he was of no account just because he was\nlittle; but he would show him what kind of a man Nils Holgersson from\nWest Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g was.\n\nA couple of moments later Akka stood in the storks' nest. It had a wheel\nfor foundation, and over this lay several grass-mats, and some twigs.\nThe nest was so old that many shrubs and plants had taken root up there;\nand when the mother stork sat on her eggs in the round hole in the\nmiddle of the nest, she not only had the beautiful outlook over a goodly\nportion of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne to enjoy, but she had also the wild brier-blossoms and\nhouse-leeks to look upon.\n\nBoth Akka and the boy saw immediately that something was going on here\nwhich turned upside down the most regular order. On the edge of the\nstork-nest sat two gray owls, an old, gray-streaked cat, and a dozen\nold, decrepit rats with protruding teeth and watery eyes. They were not\nexactly the sort of animals one usually finds living peaceably together.\n\nNot one of them turned around to look at Akka, or to bid her welcome.\nThey thought of nothing except to sit and stare at some long, gray\nlines, which came into sight here and there--on the winter-naked\nmeadows.\n\nAll the black rats were silent. One could see that they were in deep\ndespair, and probably knew that they could neither defend their own\nlives nor the castle. The two owls sat and rolled their big eyes, and\ntwisted their great, encircling eyebrows, and talked in hollow,\nghost-like voices, about the awful cruelty of the gray rats, and that\nthey would have to move away from their nest, because they had heard it\nsaid of them that they spared neither eggs nor baby birds. The old\ngray-streaked cat was positive that the gray rats would bite him to\ndeath, since they were coming into the castle in such great numbers, and\nhe scolded the black rats incessantly. \"How could you be so idiotic as\nto let your best fighters go away?\" said he. \"How could you trust the\ngray rats? It is absolutely unpardonable!\"\n\nThe twelve black rats did not say a word. But the stork, despite his\nmisery, could not refrain from teasing the cat. \"Don't worry so, Monsie\nhouse-cat!\" said he. \"Can't you see that mother Akka and Thumbietot have\ncome to save the castle? You can be certain that they'll succeed. Now I\nmust stand up to sleep--and I do so with the utmost calm. To-morrow,\nwhen I awaken, there won't be a single gray rat in Glimminge castle.\"\n\nThe boy winked at Akka, and made a sign--as the stork stood upon the\nvery edge of the nest, with one leg drawn up, to sleep--that he wanted\nto push him down to the ground; but Akka restrained him. She did not\nseem to be the least bit angry. Instead, she said in a confident tone of\nvoice: \"It would be pretty poor business if one who is as old as I am\ncould not manage to get out of worse difficulties than this. If only Mr.\nand Mrs. Owl, who can stay awake all night, will fly off with a couple\nof messages for me, I think that all will go well.\"\n\nBoth owls were willing. Then Akka bade the gentleman owl that he should\ngo and seek the black rats who had gone off, and counsel them to hurry\nhome immediately. The lady owl she sent to Flammea, the steeple-owl,\nwho lived in Lund cathedral, with a commission which was so secret that\nAkka only dared to confide it to her in a whisper.\n\nTHE RAT CHARMER\n\nIt was getting on toward midnight when the gray rats after a diligent\nsearch succeeded in finding an open air-hole in the cellar. This was\npretty high upon the wall; but the rats got up on one another's\nshoulders, and it wasn't long before the most daring among them sat in\nthe air-hole, ready to force its way into Glimminge castle, outside\nwhose walls so many of its forebears had fallen.\n\nThe gray rat sat still for a moment in the hole, and waited for an\nattack from within. The leader of the defenders was certainly away, but\nshe assumed that the black rats who were still in the castle wouldn't\nsurrender without a struggle. With thumping heart she listened for the\nslightest sound, but everything remained quiet. Then the leader of the\ngray rats plucked up courage and jumped down in the coal-black cellar.\n\nOne after another of the gray rats followed the leader. They all kept\nvery quiet; and all expected to be ambushed by the black rats. Not until\nso many of them had crowded into the cellar that the floor couldn't hold\nany more, did they venture farther.\n\nAlthough they had never before been inside the building, they had no\ndifficulty in finding their way. They soon found the passages in the\nwalls which the black rats had used to get to the upper floors. Before\nthey began to clamber up these narrow and steep steps, they listened\nagain with great attention. They felt more frightened because the black\nrats held themselves aloof in this way, than if they had met them in\nopen battle. They could hardly believe their luck when they reached the\nfirst story without any mishaps.\n\nImmediately upon their entrance the gray rats caught the scent of the\ngrain, which was stored in great bins on the floor. But it was not as\nyet time for them to begin to enjoy their conquest. They searched first,\nwith the utmost caution, through the sombre, empty rooms. They ran up in\nthe fireplace, which stood on the floor in the old castle kitchen, and\nthey almost tumbled into the well, in the inner room. Not one of the\nnarrow peep-holes did they leave uninspected, but they found no black\nrats. When this floor was wholly in their possession, they began, with\nthe same caution, to acquire the next. Then they had to venture on a\nbold and dangerous climb through the walls, while, with breathless\nanxiety, they awaited an assault from the enemy. And although they were\ntempted by the most delicious odour from the grain bins, they forced\nthemselves most systematically to inspect the old-time warriors'\npillar-propped kitchen; their stone table, and fireplace; the deep\nwindow-niches, and the hole in the floor--which in olden time had been\nopened to pour down boiling pitch on the intruding enemy.\n\nAll this time the black rats were invisible. The gray ones groped their\nway to the third story, and into the lord of the castle's great banquet\nhall--which stood there cold and empty, like all the other rooms in the\nold house. They even groped their way to the upper story, which had but\none big, barren room. The only place they did not think of exploring was\nthe big stork-nest on the roof--where, just at this time, the lady owl\nawakened Akka, and informed her that Flammea, the steeple owl, had\ngranted her request, and had sent her the thing she wished for.\n\nSince the gray rats had so conscientiously inspected the entire castle,\nthey felt at ease. They took it for granted that the black rats had\nflown, and didn't intend to offer any resistance; and, with light\nhearts, they ran up into the grain bins.\n\nBut the gray rats had hardly swallowed the first wheat-grains, before\nthe sound of a little shrill pipe was heard from the yard. The gray rats\nraised their heads, listened anxiously, ran a few steps as if they\nintended to leave the bin, then they turned back and began to eat once\nmore.\n\nAgain the pipe sounded a sharp and piercing note--and now something\nwonderful happened. One rat, two rats--yes, a whole lot of rats left the\ngrain, jumped from the bins and hurried down cellar by the shortest cut,\nto get out of the house. Still there were many gray rats left. These\nthought of all the toil and trouble it had cost them to win Glimminge\ncastle, and they did not want to leave it. But again they caught the\ntones from the pipe, and had to follow them. With wild excitement they\nrushed up from the bins, slid down through the narrow holes in the\nwalls, and tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get out.\n\nIn the middle of the courtyard stood a tiny creature, who blew upon a\npipe. All round him he had a whole circle of rats who listened to him,\nastonished and fascinated; and every moment brought more. Once he took\nthe pipe from his lips--only for a second--put his thumb to his nose and\nwiggled his fingers at the gray rats; and then it looked as if they\nwanted to throw themselves on him and bite him to death; but as soon as\nhe blew on his pipe they were in his power.\n\nWhen the tiny creature had played all the gray rats out of Glimminge\ncastle, he began to wander slowly from the courtyard out on the highway;\nand all the gray rats followed him, because the tones from that pipe\nsounded so sweet to their ears that they could not resist them.\n\nThe tiny creature walked before them and charmed them along with him,\non the road to Vallby. He led them into all sorts of crooks and turns\nand bends--on through hedges and down into ditches--and wherever he went\nthey had to follow. He blew continuously on his pipe, which appeared to\nbe made from an animal's horn, although the horn was so small that, in\nour days, there were no animals from whose foreheads it could have been\nbroken. No one knew, either, who had made it. Flammea, the steeple-owl,\nhad found it in a niche, in Lund cathedral. She had shown it to Bataki,\nthe raven; and they had both figured out that this was the kind of horn\nthat was used in former times by those who wished to gain power over\nrats and mice. But the raven was Akka's friend; and it was from him she\nhad learned that Flammea owned a treasure like this. And it was true\nthat the rats could not resist the pipe. The boy walked before them and\nplayed as long as the starlight lasted--and all the while they followed\nhim. He played at daybreak; he played at sunrise; and the whole time the\nentire procession of gray rats followed him, and were enticed farther\nand farther away from the big grain loft at Glimminge castle.\n\n\nTHE GREAT CRANE DANCE ON KULLABERG\n\n\n_Tuesday, March twenty-ninth_.\n\nAlthough there are many magnificent buildings in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, it must be\nacknowledged that there's not one among them that has such pretty walls\nas old Kullaberg.\n\nKullaberg is low and rather long. It is not by any means a big or\nimposing mountain. On its broad summit you'll find woods and grain\nfields, and one and another heather-heath. Here and there, round\nheather-knolls and barren cliffs rise up. It is not especially pretty up\nthere. It looks a good deal like all the other upland places in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne.\n\nHe who walks along the path which runs across the middle of the\nmountain, can't help feeling a little disappointed. Then he happens,\nperhaps, to turn away from the path, and wanders off toward the\nmountain's sides and looks down over the bluffs; and then, all at once,\nhe will discover so much that is worth seeing, he hardly knows how he'll\nfind time to take in the whole of it. For it happens that Kullaberg\ndoes not stand on the land, with plains and valleys around it, like\nother mountains; but it has plunged into the sea, as far out as it could\nget. Not even the tiniest strip of land lies below the mountain to\nprotect it against the breakers; but these reach all the way up to the\nmountain walls, and can polish and mould them to suit themselves. This\nis why the walls stand there as richly ornamented as the sea and its\nhelpmeet, the wind, have been able to effect. You'll find steep ravines\nthat are deeply chiselled in the mountain's sides; and black crags that\nhave become smooth and shiny under the constant lashing of the winds.\nThere are solitary rock-columns that spring right up out of the water,\nand dark grottoes with narrow entrances. There are barren, perpendicular\nprecipices, and soft, leaf-clad inclines. There are small points, and\nsmall inlets, and small rolling stones that are rattlingly washed up and\ndown with every dashing breaker. There are majestic cliff-arches that\nproject over the water. There are sharp stones that are constantly\nsprayed by a white foam; and others that mirror themselves in\nunchangeable dark-green still water. There are giant troll-caverns\nshaped in the rock, and great crevices that lure the wanderer to venture\ninto the mountain's depths--all the way to Kullman's Hollow.\n\nAnd over and around all these cliffs and rocks crawl entangled tendrils\nand weeds. Trees grow there also, but the wind's power is so great that\ntrees have to transform themselves into clinging vines, that they may\nget a firm hold on the steep precipices. The oaks creep along on the\nground, while their foliage hangs over them like a low ceiling; and\nlong-limbed beeches stand in the ravines like great leaf-tents.\n\nThese remarkable mountain walls, with the blue sea beneath them, and the\nclear penetrating air above them, is what makes Kullaberg so dear to the\npeople that great crowds of them haunt the place every day as long as\nthe summer lasts. But it is more difficult to tell what it is that makes\nit so attractive to animals, that every year they gather there for a big\nplay-meeting. This is a custom that has been observed since time\nimmemorial; and one should have been there when the first sea-wave was\ndashed into foam against the shore, to be able to explain just why\nKullaberg was chosen as a rendezvous, in preference to all other places.\n\nWhen the meeting is to take place, the stags and roebucks and hares and\nfoxes and all the other four-footers make the journey to Kullaberg the\nnight before, so as not to be observed by the human beings. Just before\nsunrise they all march up to the playground, which is a heather-heath on\nthe left side of the road, and not very far from the mountain's most\nextreme point. The playground is inclosed on all sides by round knolls,\nwhich conceal it from any and all who do not happen to come right upon\nit. And in the month of March it is not at all likely that any\npedestrians will stray off up there. All the strangers who usually\nstroll around on the rocks, and clamber up the mountain's sides the fall\nstorms have driven away these many months past. And the lighthouse\nkeeper out there on the point; the old fru on the mountain farm, and the\nmountain peasant and his house-folk go their accustomed ways, and do not\nrun about on the desolate heather-fields.\n\nWhen the four-footers have arrived on the playground, they take their\nplaces on the round knolls. Each animal family keeps to itself, although\nit is understood that, on a day like this, universal peace reigns, and\nno one need fear attack. On this day a little hare might wander over to\nthe foxes' hill, without losing as much as one of his long ears. But\nstill the animals arrange themselves into separate groups. This is an\nold custom.\n\nAfter they have all taken their places, they begin to look around for\nthe birds. It is always beautiful weather on this day. The cranes are\ngood weather prophets, and would not call the animals together if they\nexpected rain. Although the air is clear, and nothing obstructs the\nvision, the four-footers see no birds. This is strange. The sun stands\nhigh in the heavens, and the birds should already be on their way.\n\nBut what the animals, on the other hand, observe, is one and another\nlittle dark cloud that comes slowly forward over the plain. And look!\none of these clouds comes gradually along the coast of \u00c3\u0096resund, and up\ntoward Kullaberg. When the cloud has come just over the playground it\nstops, and, simultaneously, the entire cloud begins to ring and chirp,\nas if it was made of nothing but tone. It rises and sinks, rises and\nsinks, but all the while it rings and chirps. At last the whole cloud\nfalls down over a knoll--all at once--and the next instant the knoll is\nentirely covered with gray larks, pretty red-white-gray bulfinches,\nspeckled starlings and greenish-yellow titmice.\n\nSoon after that, another cloud comes over the plain. This stops over\nevery bit of land; over peasant cottage and palace; over towns and\ncities; over farms and railway stations; over fishing hamlets and sugar\nrefineries. Every time it stops, it draws to itself a little whirling\ncolumn of gray dust-grains from the ground. In this way it grows and\ngrows. And at last, when it is all gathered up and heads for Kullaberg,\nit is no longer a cloud but a whole mist, which is so big that it throws\na shadow on the ground all the way from H\u00c3\u00b6gan\u00c3\u00a4s to M\u00c3\u00b6lle. When it stops\nover the playground it hides the sun; and for a long while it had to\nrain gray sparrows on one of the knolls, before those who had been\nflying in the innermost part of the mist could again catch a glimpse of\nthe daylight.\n\nBut still the biggest of these bird-clouds is the one which now appears.\nThis has been formed of birds who have travelled from every direction to\njoin it. It is dark bluish-gray, and no sun-ray can penetrate it. It is\nfull of the ghastliest noises, the most frightful shrieks, the grimmest\nlaughter, and most ill-luck-boding croaking! All on the playground are\nglad when it finally resolves itself into a storm of fluttering and\ncroaking: of crows and jackdaws and rooks and ravens.\n\nThereupon not only clouds are seen in the heavens, but a variety of\nstripes and figures. Then straight, dotted lines appear in the East and\nNortheast. These are forest-birds from G\u00c3\u00b6inge districts: black grouse\nand wood grouse who come flying in long lines a couple of metres apart.\nSwimming-birds that live around M\u00c3\u00a5kl\u00c3\u00a4ppen, just out of Falsterbo, now\ncome floating over \u00c3\u0096resund in many extraordinary figures: in triangular\nand long curves; in sharp hooks and semicircles.\n\nTo the great reunion held the year that Nils Holgersson travelled\naround with the wild geese, came Akka and her flock--later than all the\nothers. And that was not to be wondered at, for Akka had to fly over the\nwhole of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne to get to Kullaberg. Beside, as soon as she awoke, she\nhad been obliged to go out and hunt for Thumbietot, who, for many hours,\nhad gone and played to the gray rats, and lured them far away from\nGlimminge castle. Mr. Owl had returned with the news that the black rats\nwould be at home immediately after sunrise; and there was no longer any\ndanger in letting the steeple-owl's pipe be hushed, and to give the gray\nrats the liberty to go where they pleased.\n\nBut it was not Akka who discovered the boy where he walked with his long\nfollowing, and quickly sank down over him and caught him with the bill\nand swung into the air with him, but it was Herr Ermenrich, the stork!\nFor Herr Ermenrich had also gone out to look for him; and after he had\nborne him up to the stork-nest, he begged his forgiveness for having\ntreated him with disrespect the evening before.\n\nThis pleased the boy immensely, and the stork and he became good\nfriends. Akka, too, showed him that she felt very kindly toward him; she\nstroked her old head several times against his arms, and commended him\nbecause he had helped those who were in trouble.\n\nBut this one must say to the boy's credit: that he did not want to\naccept praise which he had not earned. \"No, mother Akka,\" he said, \"you\nmustn't think that I lured the gray rats away to help the black ones. I\nonly wanted to show Herr Ermenrich that I was of some consequence.\"\n\nHe had hardly said this before Akka turned to the stork and asked if he\nthought it was advisable to take Thumbietot along to Kullaberg. \"I mean,\nthat we can rely on him as upon ourselves,\" said she. The stork at once\nadvised, most enthusiastically, that Thumbietot be permitted to come\nalong. \"Certainly you shall take Thumbietot along to Kullaberg, mother\nAkka,\" said he. \"It is fortunate for us that we can repay him for all\nthat he has endured this night for our sakes. And since it still grieves\nme to think that I did not conduct myself in a becoming manner toward\nhim the other evening, it is I who will carry him on my back--all the\nway to the meeting place.\"\n\nThere isn't much that tastes better than to receive praise from those\nwho are themselves wise and capable; and the boy had certainly never\nfelt so happy as he did when the wild goose and the stork talked about\nhim in this way.\n\nThus the boy made the trip to Kullaberg, riding stork-back. Although he\nknew that this was a great honour, it caused him much anxiety, for Herr\nErmenrich was a master flyer, and started off at a very different pace\nfrom the wild geese. While Akka flew her straight way with even\nwing-strokes, the stork amused himself by performing a lot of flying\ntricks. Now he lay still in an immeasurable height, and floated in the\nair without moving his wings, now he flung himself downward with such\nsudden haste that it seemed as though he would fall to the ground,\nhelpless as a stone; now he had lots of fun flying all around Akka, in\ngreat and small circles, like a whirlwind. The boy had never been on a\nride of this sort before; and although he sat there all the while in\nterror, he had to acknowledge to himself that he had never before known\nwhat a good flight meant.\n\nOnly a single pause was made during the journey, and that was at Vomb\nLake when Akka joined her travelling companions, and called to them that\nthe gray rats had been vanquished. After that, the travellers flew\nstraight to Kullaberg.\n\nThere they descended to the knoll reserved for the wild geese; and as\nthe boy let his glance wander from knoll to knoll, he saw on one of them\nthe many-pointed antlers of the stags; and on another, the gray herons'\nneck-crests. One knoll was red with foxes, one was gray with rats; one\nwas covered with black ravens who shrieked continually, one with larks\nwho simply couldn't keep still, but kept on throwing themselves in the\nair and singing for very joy.\n\nJust as it has ever been the custom on Kullaberg, it was the crows who\nbegan the day's games and frolics with their flying-dance. They divided\nthemselves into two flocks, that flew toward each other, met, turned,\nand began all over again. This dance had many repetitions, and appeared\nto the spectators who were not familiar with the dance as altogether too\nmonotonous. The crows were very proud of their dance, but all the others\nwere glad when it was over. It appeared to the animals about as gloomy\nand meaningless as the winter-storms' play with the snow-flakes. It\ndepressed them to watch it, and they waited eagerly for something that\nshould give them a little pleasure.\n\nThey did not have to wait in vain, either; for as soon as the crows had\nfinished, the hares came running. They dashed forward in a long row,\nwithout any apparent order. In some of the figures, one single hare\ncame; in others, they ran three and four abreast. They had all raised\nthemselves on two legs, and they rushed forward with such rapidity that\ntheir long ears swayed in all directions. As they ran, they spun round,\nmade high leaps and beat their forepaws against their hind-paws so that\nthey rattled. Some performed a long succession of somersaults, others\ndoubled themselves up and rolled over like wheels; one stood on one leg\nand swung round; one walked upon his forepaws. There was no regulation\nwhatever, but there was much that was droll in the hares' play; and the\nmany animals who stood and watched them began to breathe faster. Now it\nwas spring; joy and rapture were advancing. Winter was over; summer was\ncoming. Soon it was only play to live.\n\nWhen the hares had romped themselves out, it was the great forest birds'\nturn to perform. Hundreds of wood-grouse in shining dark-brown array,\nand with bright red eyebrows, flung themselves up into a great oak that\nstood in the centre of the playground. The one who sat upon the topmost\nbranch fluffed up his feathers, lowered his wings, and lifted his tail\nso that the white covert-feathers were seen. Thereupon he stretched his\nneck and sent forth a couple of deep notes from his thick throat.\n\"Tjack, tjack, tjack,\" it sounded. More than this he could not utter. It\nonly gurgled a few times way down in the throat. Then he closed his eyes\nand whispered: \"Sis, sis, sis. Hear how pretty! Sis, sis, sis.\" At the\nsame time he fell into such an ecstasy that he no longer knew what was\ngoing on around him.\n\nWhile the first wood grouse was sissing, the three nearest--under\nhim--began to sing; and before they had finished their song, the ten who\nsat lower down joined in; and thus it continued from branch to branch,\nuntil the entire hundred grouse sang and gurgled and sissed. They all\nfell into the same ecstasy during their song, and this affected the\nother animals like a contagious transport. Lately the blood had flowed\nlightly and agreeably; now it began to grow heavy and hot. \"Yes, this is\nsurely spring,\" thought all the animal folk. \"Winter chill has vanished.\nThe fires of spring burn over the earth.\"\n\nWhen the black grouse saw that the brown grouse were having such\nsuccess, they could no longer keep quiet. As there was no tree for them\nto light on, they rushed down on the playground, where the heather stood\nso high that only their beautifully turned tail-feathers and their\nthick bills were visible--and they began to sing: \"Orr, orr, orr.\"\n\nJust as the black grouse began to compete with the brown grouse,\nsomething unprecedented happened. While all the animals thought of\nnothing but the grouse-game, a fox stole slowly over to the wild geese's\nknoll. He glided very cautiously, and came way up on the knoll before\nanyone noticed him. Suddenly a goose caught sight of him; and as she\ncould not believe that a fox had sneaked in among the geese for any good\npurpose, she began to cry: \"Have a care, wild geese! Have a care!\" The\nfox struck her across the throat--mostly, perhaps, because he wanted to\nmake her keep quiet--but the wild geese had already heard the cry and\nthey all raised themselves in the air. And when they had flown up, the\nanimals saw Smirre Fox standing on the wild geese's knoll, with a dead\ngoose in his mouth.\n\nBut because he had in this way broken the play-day's peace, such a\npunishment was meted out to Smirre Fox that, for the rest of his days,\nhe must regret he had not been able to control his thirst for revenge,\nbut had attempted to approach Akka and her flock in this manner.\n\nHe was immediately surrounded by a crowd of foxes, and doomed in\naccordance with an old custom, which demands that whosoever disturbs the\npeace on the great play-day, must go into exile. Not a fox wished to\nlighten the sentence, since they all knew that the instant they\nattempted anything of the sort, they would be driven from the\nplayground, and would nevermore be permitted to enter it. Banishment was\npronounced upon Smirre without opposition. He was forbidden to remain in\nSk\u00c3\u00a5ne. He was banished from wife and kindred; from hunting grounds,\nhome, resting places and retreats, which he had hitherto owned; and he\nmust tempt fortune in foreign lands. So that all foxes in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne should\nknow that Smirre was outlawed in the district, the oldest of the foxes\nbit off his right earlap. As soon as this was done, all the young foxes\nbegan to yowl from blood-thirst, and threw themselves on Smirre. For him\nthere was no alternative except to take flight; and with all the young\nfoxes in hot pursuit, he rushed away from Kullaberg.\n\nAll this happened while black grouse and brown grouse were going on with\ntheir games. But these birds lose themselves so completely in their\nsong, that they neither hear nor see. Nor had they permitted themselves\nto be disturbed.\n\nThe forest birds' contest was barely over, before the stags from\nH\u00c3\u00a4ckeberga came forward to show their wrestling game. There were several\npairs of stags who fought at the same time. They rushed at each other\nwith tremendous force, struck their antlers dashingly together, so that\ntheir points were entangled; and tried to force each other backward. The\nheather-heaths were torn up beneath their hoofs; the breath came like\nsmoke from their nostrils; out of their throats strained hideous\nbellowings, and the froth oozed down on their shoulders.\n\nOn the knolls round about there was breathless silence while the skilled\nstag-wrestlers clinched. In all the animals new emotions were awakened.\nEach and all felt courageous and, strong; enlivened by returning powers;\nborn again with the spring; sprightly, and ready for all kinds of\nadventures. They felt no enmity toward each other, although, everywhere,\nwings were lifted, neck-feathers raised and claws sharpened. If the\nstags from H\u00c3\u00a4ckeberga had continued another instant, a wild struggle\nwould have arisen on the knolls, for all had been gripped with a burning\ndesire to show that they too were full of life because the winter's\nimpotence was over and strength surged through their bodies.\n\nBut the stags stopped wrestling just at the right moment, and instantly\na whisper went from knoll to knoll: \"The cranes are coming!\"\n\nAnd then came the gray, dusk-clad birds with plumes in their wings, and\nred feather-ornaments on their necks. The big birds with their tall\nlegs, their slender throats, their small heads, came gliding down the\nknoll with an abandon that was full of mystery. As they glided forward\nthey swung round--half flying, half dancing. With wings gracefully\nlifted, they moved with an inconceivable rapidity. There was something\nmarvellous and strange about their dance. It was as though gray shadows\nhad played a game which the eye could scarcely follow. It was as if\nthey had learned it from the mists that hover over desolate morasses.\nThere was witchcraft in it. All those who had never before been on\nKullaberg understood why the whole meeting took its name from the\ncrane's dance. There was wildness in it; but yet the feeling which it\nawakened was a delicious longing. No one thought any more about\nstruggling. Instead, both the winged and those who had no wings, all\nwanted to raise themselves eternally, lift themselves above the clouds,\nseek that which was hidden beyond them, leave the oppressive body that\ndragged them down to earth and soar away toward the infinite.\n\nSuch longing after the unattainable, after the hidden mysteries back of\nthis life, the animals felt only once a year; and this was on the day\nwhen they beheld the great crane dance.\n\n\nIN RAINY WEATHER\n\n\n_Wednesday, March thirtieth_.\n\nIt was the first rainy day of the trip. As long as the wild geese had\nremained in the vicinity of Vomb Lake, they had had beautiful weather;\nbut on the day when they set out to travel farther north, it began to\nrain, and for several hours the boy had to sit on the goose-back,\nsoaking wet, and shivering with the cold.\n\nIn the morning when they started, it had been clear and mild. The wild\ngeese had flown high up in the air--evenly, and without haste--with Akka\nat the head maintaining strict discipline, and the rest in two oblique\nlines back of her. They had not taken the time to shout any witty\nsarcasms to the animals on the ground; but, as it was simply impossible\nfor them to keep perfectly silent, they sang out continually--in rhythm\nwith the wing-strokes--their usual coaxing call: \"Where are you? Here\nam I. Where are you? Here am I.\"\n\nThey all took part in this persistent calling, and only stopped, now and\nthen, to show the goosey-gander the landmarks they were travelling over.\nThe places on this route included Linder\u00c3\u00b6dsosen's dry hills, Ovesholm's\nmanor, Christianstad's church steeple, B\u00c3\u00a4ckaskog's royal castle on the\nnarrow isthmus between Oppmann's lake and Iv\u00c3\u00b6's lake, Ryss mountain's\nsteep precipice.\n\nIt had been a monotonous trip, and when the rain-clouds made their\nappearance the boy thought it was a real diversion. In the old days,\nwhen he had only seen a rain-cloud from below, he had imagined that they\nwere gray and disagreeable; but it was a very different thing to be up\namongst them. Now he saw distinctly that the clouds were enormous carts,\nwhich drove through the heavens with sky-high loads. Some of them were\npiled up with huge, gray sacks, some with barrels; some were so large\nthat they could hold a whole lake; and a few were filled with big\nutensils and bottles which were piled up to an immense height. And when\nso many of them had driven forward that they filled the whole sky, it\nappeared as though someone had given a signal, for all at once, water\ncommenced to pour down over the earth, from utensils, barrels, bottles\nand sacks.\n\nJust as the first spring-showers pattered against the ground, there\narose such shouts of joy from all the small birds in groves and\npastures, that the whole air rang with them and the boy leaped high\nwhere he sat. \"Now we'll have rain. Rain gives us spring; spring gives\nus flowers and green leaves; green leaves and flowers give us worms and\ninsects; worms and insects give us food; and plentiful and good food is\nthe best thing there is,\" sang the birds.\n\nThe wild geese, too, were glad of the rain which came to awaken the\ngrowing things from their long sleep, and to drive holes in the\nice-roofs on the lakes. They were not able to keep up that seriousness\nany longer, but began to send merry calls over the neighbourhood.\n\nWhen they flew over the big potato patches, which are so plentiful in\nthe country around Christianstad--and which still lay bare and\nblack--they screamed: \"Wake up and be useful! Here comes something that\nwill awaken you. You have idled long enough now.\"\n\nWhen they saw people who hurried to get out of the rain, they reproved\nthem saying: \"What are you in such a hurry about? Can't you see that\nit's raining rye-loaves and cookies?\"\n\nIt was a big, thick mist that moved northward briskly, and followed\nclose upon the geese. They seemed to think that they dragged the mist\nalong with them; and, just now, when they saw great orchards beneath\nthem, they called out proudly: \"Here we come with anemones; here we come\nwith roses; here we come with apple blossoms and cherry buds; here we\ncome with peas and beans and turnips and cabbages. He who wills can take\nthem. He who wills can take them.\"\n\nThus it had sounded while the first showers fell, and when all were\nstill glad of the rain. But when it continued to fall the whole\nafternoon, the wild geese grew impatient, and cried to the thirsty\nforests around Iv\u00c3\u00b6s lake: \"Haven't you got enough yet? Haven't you got\nenough yet?\"\n\nThe heavens were growing grayer and grayer and the sun hid itself so\nwell that one couldn't imagine where it was. The rain fell faster and\nfaster, and beat harder and harder against the wings, as it tried to\nfind its way between the oily outside feathers, into their skins. The\nearth was hidden by fogs; lakes, mountains, and woods floated together\nin an indistinct maze, and the landmarks could not be distinguished. The\nflight became slower and slower; the joyful cries were hushed; and the\nboy felt the cold more and more keenly.\n\nBut still he had kept up his courage as long as he had ridden through\nthe air. And in the afternoon, when they had lighted under a little\nstunted pine, in the middle of a large morass, where all was wet, and\nall was cold; where some knolls were covered with snow, and others stood\nup naked in a puddle of half-melted ice-water, even then, he had not\nfelt discouraged, but ran about in fine spirits, and hunted for\ncranberries and frozen whortleberries. But then came evening, and\ndarkness sank down on them so close, that not even such eyes as the\nboy's could see through it; and all the wilderness became so strangely\ngrim and awful. The boy lay tucked in under the goosey-gander's wing,\nbut could not sleep because he was cold and wet. He heard such a lot of\nrustling and rattling and stealthy steps and menacing voices, that he\nwas terror-stricken and didn't know where he should go. He must go\nsomewhere, where there was light and heat, if he wasn't going to be\nentirely scared to death.\n\n\"If I should venture where there are human beings, just for this night?\"\nthought the boy. \"Only so I could sit by a fire for a moment, and get a\nlittle food. I could go back to the wild geese before sunrise.\"\n\nHe crept from under the wing and slid down to the ground. He didn't\nawaken either the goosey-gander or any of the other geese, but stole,\nsilently and unobserved, through the morass.\n\nHe didn't know exactly where on earth he was: if he was in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, in\nSm\u00c3\u00a5land, or in Blekinge. But just before he had gotten down in the\nmorass, he had caught a glimpse of a large village, and thither he\ndirected his steps. It wasn't long, either, before he discovered a road;\nand soon he was on the village street, which was long, and had planted\ntrees on both sides, and was bordered with garden after garden.\n\nThe boy had come to one of the big cathedral towns, which are so common\non the uplands, but can hardly be seen at all down in the plain.\n\nThe houses were of wood, and very prettily constructed. Most of them had\ngables and fronts, edged with carved mouldings, and glass doors, with\nhere and there a coloured pane, opening on verandas. The walls were\npainted in light oil-colours; the doors and window-frames shone in blues\nand greens, and even in reds. While the boy walked about and viewed the\nhouses, he could hear, all the way out to the road, how the people who\nsat in the warm cottages chattered and laughed. The words he could not\ndistinguish, but he thought it was just lovely to hear human voices. \"I\nwonder what they would say if I knocked and begged to be let in,\"\nthought he.\n\nThis was, of course, what he had intended to do all along, but now that\nhe saw the lighted windows, his fear of the darkness was gone. Instead,\nhe felt again that shyness which always came over him now when he was\nnear human beings. \"I'll take a look around the town for a while\nlonger,\" thought he, \"before I ask anyone to take me in.\"\n\nOn one house there was a balcony. And just as the boy walked by, the\ndoors were thrown open, and a yellow light streamed through the fine,\nsheer curtains. Then a pretty young fru came out on the balcony and\nleaned over the railing. \"It's raining; now we shall soon have spring,\"\nsaid she. When the boy saw her he felt a strange anxiety. It was as\nthough he wanted to weep. For the first time he was a bit uneasy because\nhe had shut himself out from the human kind.\n\nShortly after that he walked by a shop. Outside the shop stood a red\ncorn-drill. He stopped and looked at it; and finally crawled up to the\ndriver's place, and seated himself. When he had got there, he smacked\nwith his lips and pretended that he sat and drove. He thought what fun\nit would be to be permitted to drive such a pretty machine over a\ngrainfield. For a moment he forgot what he was like now; then he\nremembered it, and jumped down quickly from the machine. Then a greater\nunrest came over him. After all, human beings were very wonderful and\nclever.\n\nHe walked by the post-office, and then he thought of all the newspapers\nwhich came every day, with news from all the four corners of the earth.\nHe saw the apothecary's shop and the doctor's home, and he thought about\nthe power of human beings, which was so great that they were able to\nbattle with sickness and death. He came to the church. Then he thought\nhow human beings had built it, that they might hear about another world\nthan the one in which they lived, of God and the resurrection and\neternal life. And the longer he walked there, the better he liked human\nbeings.\n\nIt is so with children that they never think any farther ahead than the\nlength of their noses. That which lies nearest them, they want\npromptly, without caring what it may cost them. Nils Holgersson had not\nunderstood what he was losing when he chose to remain an elf; but now he\nbegan to be dreadfully afraid that, perhaps, he should never again get\nback to his right form.\n\nHow in all the world should he go to work in order to become human? This\nhe wanted, oh! so much, to know.\n\nHe crawled up on a doorstep, and seated himself in the pouring rain and\nmeditated. He sat there one whole hour--two whole hours, and he thought\nso hard that his forehead lay in furrows; but he was none the wiser. It\nseemed as though the thoughts only rolled round and round in his head.\nThe longer he sat there, the more impossible it seemed to him to find\nany solution.\n\n\"This thing is certainly much too difficult for one who has learned as\nlittle as I have,\" he thought at last. \"It will probably wind up by my\nhaving to go back among human beings after all. I must ask the minister\nand the doctor and the schoolmaster and others who are learned, and may\nknow a cure for such things.\"\n\nThis he concluded that he would do at once, and shook himself--for he\nwas as wet as a dog that has been in a water-pool.\n\nJust about then he saw that a big owl came flying along, and alighted on\none of the trees that bordered the village street. The next instant a\nlady owl, who sat under the cornice of the house, began to call out:\n\"Kivitt, Kivitt! Are you at home again, Mr. Gray Owl? What kind of a\ntime did you have abroad?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Lady Brown Owl. I had a very comfortable time,\" said the\ngray owl. \"Has anything out of the ordinary happened here at home during\nmy absence?\"\n\n\"Not here in Blekinge, Mr. Gray Owl; but in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne a marvellous thing has\nhappened! A boy has been transformed by an elf into a goblin no bigger\nthan a squirrel; and since then he has gone to Lapland with a tame\ngoose.\"\n\n\"That's a remarkable bit of news, a remarkable bit of news. Can he never\nbe human again, Lady Brown Owl? Can he never be human again?\"\n\n\"That's a secret, Mr. Gray Owl; but you shall hear it just the same.\nThe elf has said that if the boy watches over the goosey-gander, so that\nhe comes home safe and sound, and--\"\n\n\"What more, Lady Brown Owl? What more? What more?\"\n\n\"Fly with me up to the church tower, Mr. Gray Owl, and you shall hear\nthe whole story! I fear there may be someone listening down here in the\nstreet.\" With that, the owls flew their way; but the boy flung his cap\nin the air, and shouted: \"If I only watch over the goosey-gander, so\nthat he gets back safe and sound, then I shall become a human being\nagain. Hurrah! Hurrah! Then I shall become a human being again!\"\n\nHe shouted \"hurrah\" until it was strange that they did not hear him in\nthe houses--but they didn't, and he hurried back to the wild geese, out\nin the wet morass, as fast as his legs could carry him.\n\n\nTHE STAIRWAY WITH THE THREE STEPS\n\n\n_Thursday, March thirty-first_.\n\nThe following day the wild geese intended to travel northward through\nAllbo district, in Sm\u00c3\u00a5land. They sent Iksi and Kaksi to spy out the\nland. But when they returned, they said that all the water was frozen,\nand all the land was snow-covered. \"We may as well remain where we are,\"\nsaid the wild geese. \"We cannot travel over a country where there is\nneither water nor food.\" \"If we remain where we are, we may have to wait\nhere until the next moon,\" said Akka. \"It is better to go eastward,\nthrough Blekinge, and see if we can't get to Sm\u00c3\u00a5land by way of M\u00c3\u00b6re,\nwhich lies near the coast, and has an early spring.\"\n\nThus the boy came to ride over Blekinge the next day. Now, that it was\nlight again, he was in a merry mood once more, and could not comprehend\nwhat had come over him the night before. He certainly didn't want to\ngive up the journey and the outdoor life now.\n\nThere lay a thick fog over Blekinge. The boy couldn't see how it looked\nout there. \"I wonder if it is a good, or a poor country that I'm riding\nover,\" thought he, and tried to search his memory for the things which\nhe had heard about the country at school. But at the same time he knew\nwell enough that this was useless, as he had never been in the habit of\nstudying his lessons.\n\nAt once the boy saw the whole school before him. The children sat by the\nlittle desks and raised their hands; the teacher sat in the lectern and\nlooked displeased; and he himself stood before the map and should answer\nsome question about Blekinge, but he hadn't a word to say. The\nschoolmaster's face grew darker and darker for every second that passed,\nand the boy thought the teacher was more particular that they should\nknow their geography, than anything else. Now he came down from the\nlectern, took the pointer from the boy, and sent him back to his seat.\n\"This won't end well,\" the boy thought then.\n\nBut the schoolmaster had gone over to a window, and had stood there for\na moment and looked out, and then he had whistled to himself once. Then\nhe had gone up into the lectern and said that he would tell them\nsomething about Blekinge. And that which he then talked about had been\nso amusing that the boy had listened. When he only stopped and thought\nfor a moment, he remembered every word.\n\n\"Sm\u00c3\u00a5land is a tall house with spruce trees on the roof,\" said the\nteacher, \"and leading up to it is a broad stairway with three big steps;\nand this stairway is called Blekinge. It is a stairway that is well\nconstructed. It stretches forty-two miles along the frontage of Sm\u00c3\u00a5land\nhouse, and anyone who wishes to go all the way down to the East sea, by\nway of the stairs, has twenty-four miles to wander.\n\n\"A good long time must have elapsed since the stairway was\nbuilt. Both days and years have gone by since the steps were hewn from\ngray stones and laid down--evenly and smoothly--for a convenient track\nbetween Sm\u00c3\u00a5land and the East sea.\n\n\"Since the stairway is so old, one can, of course, understand that it\ndoesn't look just the same now, as it did when it was new. I don't know\nhow much they troubled themselves about such matters at that time; but\nbig as it was, no broom could have kept it clean. After a couple of\nyears, moss and lichen began to grow on it. In the autumn dry leaves and\ndry grass blew down over it; and in the spring it was piled up with\nfalling stones and gravel. And as all these things were left there to\nmould, they finally gathered so much soil on the steps that not only\nherbs and grass, but even bushes and trees could take root there.\n\n\"But, at the same time, a great disparity has arisen between the three\nsteps. The topmost step, which lies nearest Sm\u00c3\u00a5land, is mostly covered\nwith poor soil and small stones, and no trees except birches and\nbird-cherry and spruce--which can stand the cold on the heights, and are\nsatisfied with little--can thrive up there. One understands best how\npoor and dry it is there, when one sees how small the field-plots are,\nthat are ploughed up from the forest lands; and how many little cabins\nthe people build for themselves; and how far it is between the churches.\nBut on the middle step there is better soil, and it does not lie bound\ndown under such severe cold, either. This one can see at a glance, since\nthe trees are both higher and of finer quality. There you'll find maple\nand oak and linden and weeping-birch and hazel trees growing, but no\ncone-trees to speak of. And it is still more noticeable because of the\namount of cultivated land that you will find there; and also because the\npeople have built themselves great and beautiful houses. On the middle\nstep, there are many churches, with large towns around them; and in\nevery way it makes a better and finer appearance than the top step.\n\n\"But the very lowest step is the best of all. It is covered with good\nrich soil; and, where it lies and bathes in the sea, it hasn't the\nslightest feeling of the Sm\u00c3\u00a5land chill. Beeches and chestnut\nand walnut trees thrive down here; and they grow so big that they tower\nabove the church-roofs. Here lie also the largest grain-fields; but the\npeople have not only timber and farming to live upon, but they are also\noccupied with fishing and trading and seafaring. For this reason you\nwill find the most costly residences and the prettiest churches here;\nand the parishes have developed into villages and cities.\n\n\"But this is not all that is said of the three steps. For one must\nrealise that when it rains on the roof of the big Sm\u00c3\u00a5land house, or when\nthe snow melts up there, the water has to go somewhere; and then,\nnaturally, a lot of it is spilled over the big stairway. In the\nbeginning it probably oozed over the whole stairway, big as it was; then\ncracks appeared in it, and, gradually, the water has accustomed itself\nto flow alongside of it, in well dug-out grooves. And water is water,\nwhatever one does with it. It never has any rest. In one place it cuts\nand files away, and in another it adds to. Those grooves it has dug into\nvales, and the walls of the vales it has decked with soil; and bushes\nand trees and vines have clung to them ever since--so thick, and in such\nprofusion, that they almost hide the stream of water that winds its way\ndown there in the deep. But when the streams come to the landings between\nthe steps, they throw themselves headlong over them; this is why the\nwater comes with such a seething rush, that it gathers strength with\nwhich to move mill-wheels and machinery--these, too, have sprung up by\nevery waterfall.\n\n\"But this does not tell all that is said of the land with the three\nsteps. It must also be told that up in the big house in Sm\u00c3\u00a5land there\nlived once upon a time a giant, who had grown very old. And it fatigued\nhim in his extreme age, to be forced to walk down that long stairway in\norder to catch salmon from the sea. To him it seemed much more suitable\nthat the salmon should come up to him, where he lived.\n\n\"Therefore, he went up on the roof of his great house; and there he\nstood and threw stones down into the East sea. He threw them with such\nforce that they flew over the whole of Blekinge and dropped into the\nsea. And when the stones came down, the salmon got so scared that they\ncame up from the sea and fled toward the Blekinge streams; ran through\nthe rapids; flung themselves with high leaps over the waterfalls, and\nstopped.\n\n\"How true this is, one can see by the number of islands and points that\nlie along the coast of Blekinge, and which are nothing in the world but\nthe big stones that the giant threw.\n\n\"One can also tell because the salmon always go up in the Blekinge\nstreams and work their way up through rapids and still water, all the\nway to Sm\u00c3\u00a5land.\n\n\"That giant is worthy of great thanks and much honour from the Blekinge\npeople; for salmon in the streams, and stone-cutting on the island--that\nmeans work which gives food to many of them even to this day.\"\n\n\nBY RONNEBY RIVER\n\n\n_Friday, April first_.\n\nNeither the wild geese nor Smirre Fox had believed that they should ever\nrun across each other after they had left Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. But now it turned out\nso that the wild geese happened to take the route over Blekinge and\nthither Smirre Fox had also gone.\n\nSo far he had kept himself in the northern parts of the province; and\nsince he had not as yet seen any manor parks, or hunting grounds filled\nwith game and dainty young deer, he was more disgruntled than he could\nsay.\n\nOne afternoon, when Smirre tramped around in the desolate forest\ndistrict of Mellanbygden, not far from Ronneby River, he saw a flock of\nwild geese fly through the air. Instantly he observed that one of the\ngeese was white and then he knew, of course, with whom he had to deal.\n\nSmirre began immediately to hunt the geese--just as much for the\npleasure of getting a good square meal, as for the desire to be avenged\nfor all the humiliation that they had heaped upon him. He saw that they\nflew eastward until they came to Ronneby River. Then they changed their\ncourse, and followed the river toward the south. He understood that they\nintended to seek a sleeping-place along the river-banks, and he thought\nthat he should be able to get hold of a pair of them without much\ntrouble. But when Smirre finally discovered the place where the wild\ngeese had taken refuge, he observed they had chosen such a\nwell-protected spot, that he couldn't get near.\n\nRonneby River isn't any big or important body of water; nevertheless, it\nis just as much talked of, for the sake of its pretty shores. At several\npoints it forces its way forward between steep mountain-walls that stand\nupright out of the water, and are entirely overgrown with honeysuckle\nand bird-cherry, mountain-ash and osier; and there isn't much that can\nbe more delightful than to row out on the little dark river on a\npleasant summer day, and look upward on all the soft green that fastens\nitself to the rugged mountain-sides.\n\nBut now, when the wild geese and Smirre came to the river, it was cold\nand blustery spring-winter; all the trees were nude, and there was\nprobably no one who thought the least little bit about whether the shore\nwas ugly or pretty. The wild geese thanked their good fortune that they\nhad found a sand-strip large enough for them to stand upon, on a steep\nmountain wall. In front of them rushed the river, which was strong and\nviolent in the snow-melting time; behind them they had an impassable\nmountain rock wall, and overhanging branches screened them. They\ncouldn't have it better.\n\nThe geese were asleep instantly; but the boy couldn't get a wink of\nsleep. As soon as the sun had disappeared he was seized with a fear of\nthe darkness, and a wilderness-terror, and he longed for human beings.\nWhere he lay--tucked in under the goose-wing--he could see nothing, and\nonly hear a little; and he thought if any harm came to the\ngoosey-gander, he couldn't save him.\n\nNoises and rustlings were heard from all directions, and he grew so\nuneasy that he had to creep from under the wing and seat himself on the\nground, beside the goose.\n\nLong-sighted Smirre stood on the mountain's summit and looked down upon\nthe wild geese. \"You may as well give this pursuit up first as last,\" he\nsaid to himself. \"You can't climb such a steep mountain; you can't swim\nin such a wild torrent; and there isn't the tiniest strip of land below\nthe mountain which leads to the sleeping-place. Those geese are too wise\nfor you. Don't ever bother yourself again to hunt them!\"\n\nBut Smirre, like all foxes, had found it hard to give up an undertaking\nalready begun, and so he lay down on the extremest point of the mountain\nedge, and did not take his eyes off the wild geese. While he lay and\nwatched them, he thought of all the harm they had done him. Yes, it was\ntheir fault that he had been driven from Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, and had been obliged to\nmove to poverty-stricken Blekinge. He worked himself up to such a pitch,\nas he lay there, that he wished the wild geese were dead, even if he,\nhimself, should not have the satisfaction of eating them.\n\nWhen Smirre's resentment had reached this height, he heard rasping in a\nlarge pine that grew close to him, and saw a squirrel come down from the\ntree, hotly pursued by a marten. Neither of them noticed Smirre; and he\nsat quietly and watched the chase, which went from tree to tree. He\nlooked at the squirrel, who moved among the branches as lightly as\nthough he'd been able to fly. He looked at the marten, who was not as\nskilled at climbing as the squirrel, but who still ran up and along the\nbranches just as securely as if they had been even paths in the forest.\n\"If I could only climb half as well as either of them,\" thought the fox,\n\"those things down there wouldn't sleep in peace very long!\"\n\nAs soon as the squirrel had been captured, and the chase was ended,\nSmirre walked over to the marten, but stopped two steps away from him,\nto signify that he did not wish to cheat him of his prey. He greeted the\nmarten in a very friendly manner, and wished him good luck with his\ncatch. Smirre chose his words well--as foxes always do. The marten, on\nthe contrary, who, with his long and slender body, his fine head, his\nsoft skin, and his light brown neck-piece, looked like a little marvel\nof beauty--but in reality was nothing but a crude forest dweller--hardly\nanswered him. \"It surprises me,\" said Smirre, \"that such a fine hunter\nas you are should be satisfied with chasing squirrels when there is much\nbetter game within reach.\" Here he paused; but when the marten only\ngrinned impudently at him, he continued: \"Can it be possible that you\nhaven't seen the wild geese that stand under the mountain wall? or are\nyou not a good enough climber to get down to them?\"\n\nThis time he had no need to wait for an answer. The marten rushed up to\nhim with back bent, and every separate hair on end. \"Have you seen wild\ngeese?\" he hissed. \"Where are they? Tell me instantly, or I'll bite your\nneck off!\" \"No! you must remember that I'm twice your size--so be a\nlittle polite. I ask nothing better than to show you the wild geese.\"\n\nThe next instant the marten was on his way down the steep; and while\nSmirre sat and watched how he swung his snake-like body from branch to\nbranch, he thought: \"That pretty tree-hunter has the wickedest heart in\nall the forest. I believe that the wild geese will have me to thank for\na bloody awakening.\"\n\nBut just as Smirre was waiting to hear the geese's death-rattle, he saw\nthe marten tumble from branch to branch--and plump into the river so the\nwater splashed high. Soon thereafter, wings beat loudly and strongly and\nall the geese went up in a hurried flight.\n\nSmirre intended to hurry after the geese, but he was so curious to know\nhow they had been saved, that he sat there until the marten came\nclambering up. That poor thing was soaked in mud, and stopped every now\nand then to rub his head with his forepaws. \"Now wasn't that just what I\nthought--that you were a booby, and would go and tumble into the river?\"\nsaid Smirre, contemptuously.\n\n\"I haven't acted boobyishly. You don't need to scold me,\" said the\nmarten. \"I sat--all ready--on one of the lowest branches and thought how\nI should manage to tear a whole lot of geese to pieces, when a little\ncreature, no bigger than a squirrel, jumped up and threw a stone at my\nhead with such force, that I fell into the water; and before I had time\nto pick myself up--\"\n\nThe marten didn't have to say any more. He had no audience. Smirre was\nalready a long way off in pursuit of the wild geese.\n\nIn the meantime Akka had flown southward in search of a new\nsleeping-place. There was still a little daylight; and, beside, the\nhalf-moon stood high in the heavens, so that she could see a little.\nLuckily, she was well acquainted in these parts, because it had\nhappened more than once that she had been wind-driven to Blekinge when\nshe travelled over the East sea in the spring.\n\nShe followed the river as long as she saw it winding through the\nmoon-lit landscape like a black, shining snake. In this way she came way\ndown to Djupafors--where the river first hides itself in an underground\nchannel--and then clear and transparent, as though it were made of\nglass, rushes down in a narrow cleft, and breaks into bits against its\nbottom in glittering drops and flying foam. Below the white falls lay a\nfew stones, between which the water rushed away in a wild torrent\ncataract. Here mother Akka alighted. This was another good\nsleeping-place--especially this late in the evening, when no human\nbeings moved about. At sunset the geese would hardly have been able to\ncamp there, for Djupafors does not lie in any wilderness. On one side of\nthe falls is a paper factory; on the other--which is steep, and\ntree-grown--is Djupadal's park, where people are always strolling about\non the steep and slippery paths to enjoy the wild stream's rushing\nmovement down in the ravine.\n\nIt was about the same here as at the former place; none of the\ntravellers thought the least little bit that they had come to a pretty\nand well-known place. They thought rather that it was ghastly and\ndangerous to stand and sleep on slippery, wet stones, in the middle of a\nrumbling waterfall. But they had to be content, if only they were\nprotected from carnivorous animals.\n\nThe geese fell asleep instantly, while the boy could find no rest in\nsleep, but sat beside them that he might watch over the goosey-gander.\n\nAfter a while, Smirre came running along the river-shore. He spied the\ngeese immediately where they stood out in the foaming whirlpools, and\nunderstood that he couldn't get at them here, either. Still he couldn't\nmake up his mind to abandon them, but seated himself on the shore and\nlooked at them. He felt very much humbled, and thought that his entire\nreputation as a hunter was at stake.\n\nAll of a sudden, he saw an otter come creeping up from the falls with a\nfish in his mouth. Smirre approached him but stopped within two steps of\nhim, to show him that he didn't wish to take his game from him.\n\n\"You're a remarkable one, who can content yourself with catching a fish,\nwhile the stones are covered with geese!\" said Smirre. He was so eager,\nthat he hadn't taken the time to arrange his words as carefully as he\nwas wont to do. The otter didn't turn his head once in the direction of\nthe river. He was a vagabond--like all otters--and had fished many times\nby Vomb Lake, and probably knew Smirre Fox. \"I know very well how you\nact when you want to coax away a salmon-trout, Smirre,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh! is it you, Gripe?\" said Smirre, and was delighted; for he knew that\nthis particular otter was a quick and accomplished swimmer. \"I don't\nwonder that you do not care to look at the wild geese, since you can't\nmanage to get out to them.\" But the otter, who had swimming-webs between\nhis toes, and a stiff tail--which was as good as an oar--and a skin that\nwas water-proof, didn't wish to have it said of him that there was a\nwaterfall that he wasn't able to manage. He turned toward the stream;\nand as soon as he caught sight of the wild geese, he threw the fish\naway, and rushed down the steep shore and into the river.\n\nIf it had been a little later in the spring, so that the nightingales in\nDjupafors had been at home, they would have sung for many a day of\nGripe's struggle with the rapid. For the otter was thrust back by the\nwaves many times, and carried down river; but he fought his way steadily\nup again. He swam forward in still water; he crawled over stones, and\ngradually came nearer the wild geese. It was a perilous trip, which\nmight well have earned the right to be sung by the nightingales.\n\nSmirre followed the otter's course with his eyes as well as he could. At\nlast he saw that the otter was in the act of climbing up to the wild\ngeese. But just then it shrieked shrill and wild. The otter tumbled\nbackward into the water, and dashed away as if he had been a blind\nkitten. An instant later, there was a great crackling of geese's wings.\nThey raised themselves and flew away to find another sleeping-place.\n\nThe otter soon came on land. He said nothing, but commenced to lick one\nof his forepaws. When Smirre sneered at him because he hadn't succeeded,\nhe broke out: \"It was not the fault of my swimming-art, Smirre. I had\nraced all the way over to the geese, and was about to climb up to them,\nwhen a tiny creature came running, and jabbed me in the foot with some\nsharp iron. It hurt so, I lost my footing, and then the current took\nme.\"\n\nHe didn't have to say any more. Smirre was already far away on his way\nto the wild geese.\n\nOnce again Akka and her flock had to take a night fly. Fortunately, the\nmoon had not gone down; and with the aid of its light, she succeeded in\nfinding another of those sleeping-places which she knew in that\nneighbourhood. Again she followed the shining river toward the south.\nOver Djupadal's manor, and over Ronneby's dark roofs and white\nwaterfalls she swayed forward without alighting. But a little south of\nthe city and not far from the sea, lies Ronneby health-spring, with its\nbath house and spring house; with its big hotel and summer cottages for\nthe spring's guests. All these stand empty and desolate in winter--which\nthe birds know perfectly well; and many are the bird-companies who seek\nshelter on the deserted buildings' balustrades and balconies during hard\nstorm-times.\n\nHere the wild geese lit on a balcony, and, as usual, they fell asleep at\nonce. The boy, on the contrary, could not sleep because he hadn't cared\nto creep in under the goosey-gander's wing.\n\nThe balcony faced south, so the boy had an outlook over the sea. And\nsince he could not sleep, he sat there and saw how pretty it looked when\nsea and land meet, here in Blekinge.\n\nYou see that sea and land can meet in many different ways. In many\nplaces the land comes down toward the sea with flat, tufted meadows, and\nthe sea meets the land with flying sand, which piles up in mounds and\ndrifts. It appears as though they both disliked each other so much that\nthey only wished to show the poorest they possessed. But it can also\nhappen that, when the land comes toward the sea, it raises a wall of\nhills in front of it--as though the sea were something dangerous. When\nthe land does this, the sea comes up to it with fiery wrath, and beats\nand roars and lashes against the rocks, and looks as if it would tear\nthe land-hill to pieces.\n\nBut in Blekinge it is altogether different when sea and land meet. There\nthe land breaks itself up into points and islands and islets; and the\nsea divides itself into fiords and bays and sounds; and it is, perhaps,\nthis which makes it look as if they must meet in happiness and harmony.\n\nThink now first and foremost of the sea! Far out it lies desolate and\nempty and big, and has nothing else to do but to roll its gray billows.\nWhen it comes toward the land, it happens across the first obstacle.\nThis it immediately overpowers; tears away everything green, and makes\nit as gray as itself. Then it meets still another obstacle. With this it\ndoes the same thing. And still another. Yes, the same thing happens to\nthis also. It is stripped and plundered, as if it had fallen into\nrobbers' hands. Then the obstacles come nearer and nearer together, and\nthen the sea must understand that the land sends toward it her littlest\nchildren, in order to move it to pity. It also becomes more friendly the\nfarther in it comes; rolls its waves less high; moderates its storms;\nlets the green things stay in cracks and crevices; separates itself into\nsmall sounds and inlets, and becomes at last so harmless in the land,\nthat little boats dare venture out on it. It certainly cannot recognise\nitself--so mild and friendly has it grown.\n\nAnd then think of the hillside! It lies uniform, and looks the same\nalmost everywhere. It consists of flat grain-fields, with one and\nanother birch-grove between them; or else of long stretches of forest\nranges. It appears as if it had thought about nothing but grain and\nturnips and potatoes and spruce and pine. Then comes a sea-fiord that\ncuts far into it. It doesn't mind that, but borders it with birch and\nalder, just as if it was an ordinary fresh-water lake. Then still\nanother wave comes driving in. Nor does the hillside bother itself about\ncringing to this, but it, too, gets the same covering as the first one.\nThen the fiords begin to broaden and separate, they break up fields and\nwoods and then the hillside cannot help but notice them. \"I believe it\nis the sea itself that is coming,\" says the hillside, and then it begins\nto adorn itself. It wreathes itself with blossoms, travels up and down\nin hills and throws islands into the sea. It no longer cares about pines\nand spruces, but casts them off like old every day clothes, and parades\nlater with big oaks and lindens and chestnuts, and with blossoming leafy\nbowers, and becomes as gorgeous as a manor-park. And when it meets the\nsea, it is so changed that it doesn't know itself. All this one cannot\nsee very well until summertime; but, at any rate, the boy observed how\nmild and friendly nature was; and he began to feel calmer than he had\nbeen before, that night. Then, suddenly, he heard a sharp and ugly yowl\nfrom the bath-house park; and when he stood up he saw, in the white\nmoonlight, a fox standing on the pavement under the balcony. For Smirre\nhad followed the wild geese once more. But when he had found the place\nwhere they were quartered, he had understood that it was impossible to\nget at them in any way; then he had not been able to keep from yowling\nwith chagrin.\n\nWhen the fox yowled in this manner, old Akka, the leader-goose, was\nawakened. Although she could see nothing, she thought she recognised the\nvoice. \"Is it you who are out to-night, Smirre?\" said she. \"Yes,\" said\nSmirre, \"it is I; and I want to ask what you geese think of the night\nthat I have given you?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that it is you who have sent the marten and otter\nagainst us?\" asked Akka. \"A good turn shouldn't be denied,\" said Smirre.\n\"You once played the goose-game with me, now I have begun to play the\nfox-game with you; and I'm not inclined to let up on it so long as a\nsingle one of you still lives even if I have to follow you the world\nover!\"\n\n\"You, Smirre, ought at least to think whether it is right for you, who\nare weaponed with both teeth and claws, to hound us in this way; we, who\nare without defence,\" said Akka.\n\nSmirre thought that Akka sounded scared, and he said quickly: \"If you,\nAkka, will take that Thumbietot--who has so often opposed me--and throw\nhim down to me, I'll promise to make peace with you. Then I'll never\nmore pursue you or any of yours.\" \"I'm not going to give you\nThumbietot,\" said Akka. \"From the youngest of us to the oldest, we would\nwillingly give our lives for his sake!\" \"Since you're so fond of him,\"\nsaid Smirre, \"I'll promise you that he shall be the first among you that\nI will wreak vengeance upon.\"\n\nAkka said no more, and after Smirre had sent up a few more yowls, all\nwas still. The boy lay all the while awake. Now it was Akka's words to\nthe fox that prevented him from sleeping. Never had he dreamed that he\nshould hear anything so great as that anyone was willing to risk life\nfor his sake. From that moment, it could no longer be said of Nils\nHolgersson that he did not care for anyone.\n\n\nKARLSKRONA\n\n\n_Saturday, April second_.\n\nIt was a moonlight evening in Karlskrona--calm and beautiful. But\nearlier in the day, there had been rain and wind; and the people must\nhave thought that the bad weather still continued, for hardly one of\nthem had ventured out on the streets.\n\nWhile the city lay there so desolate, Akka, the wild goose, and her\nflock, came flying toward it over Vemm\u00c3\u00b6n and Pantarholmen. They were out\nin the late evening to seek a sleeping place on the islands. They\ncouldn't remain inland because they were disturbed by Smirre Fox\nwherever they lighted.\n\nWhen the boy rode along high up in the air, and looked at the sea and\nthe islands which spread themselves before him, he thought that\neverything appeared so strange and spook-like. The heavens were no\nlonger blue, but encased him like a globe of green glass. The sea was\nmilk-white, and as far as he could see rolled small white waves tipped\nwith silver ripples. In the midst of all this white lay numerous little\nislets, absolutely coal black. Whether they were big or little, whether\nthey were as even as meadows, or full of cliffs, they looked just as\nblack. Even dwelling houses and churches and windmills, which at other\ntimes are white or red, were outlined in black against the green sky.\nThe boy thought it was as if the earth had been transformed, and he was\ncome to another world.\n\nHe thought that just for this one night he wanted to be brave, and not\nafraid--when he saw something that really frightened him. It was a high\ncliff island, which was covered with big, angular blocks; and between\nthe blocks shone specks of bright, shining gold. He couldn't keep from\nthinking of Maglestone, by Trolle-Ljungby, which the trolls sometimes\nraised upon high gold pillars; and he wondered if this was something\nlike that.\n\nBut with the stones and the gold it might have gone fairly well, if such\na lot of horrid things had not been lying all around the island. It\nlooked like whales and sharks and other big sea-monsters. But the boy\nunderstood that it was the sea-trolls, who had gathered around the\nisland and intended to crawl up on it, to fight with the land-trolls who\nlived there. And those on the land were probably afraid, for he saw how\na big giant stood on the highest point of the island and raised his\narms--as if in despair over all the misfortune that should come to him\nand his island.\n\nThe boy was not a little terrified when he noticed that Akka began to\ndescend right over that particular island! \"No, for pity's sake! We\nmust not light there,\" said he.\n\nBut the geese continued to descend, and soon the boy was astonished that\nhe could have seen things so awry. In the first place, the big stone\nblocks were nothing but houses. The whole island was a city; and the\nshining gold specks were street lamps and lighted window-panes. The\ngiant, who stood highest up on the island, and raised his arms, was a\nchurch with two cross-towers; all the sea-trolls and monsters, which he\nthought he had seen, were boats and ships of every description, that lay\nanchored all around the island. On the side which lay toward the land\nwere mostly row-boats and sailboats and small coast steamers; but on the\nside that faced the sea lay armour-clad battleships; some were broad,\nwith very thick, slanting smokestacks; others were long and narrow, and\nso constructed that they could glide through the water like fishes.\n\nNow what city might this be? That, the boy could figure out because he\nsaw all the battleships. All his life he had loved ships, although he\nhad had nothing to do with any, except the galleys which he had sailed\nin the road ditches. He knew very well that this city--where so many\nbattleships lay--couldn't be any place but Karlskrona.\n\nThe boy's grandfather had been an old marine; and as long as he had\nlived, he had talked of Karlskrona every day; of the great warship dock,\nand of all the other things to be seen in that city. The boy felt\nperfectly at home, and he was glad that he should see all this of which\nhe had heard so much.\n\nBut he only had a glimpse of the towers and fortifications which barred\nthe entrance to the harbour, and the many buildings, and the\nshipyard--before Akka came down on one of the flat church-towers.\n\nThis was a pretty safe place for those who wanted to get away from a\nfox, and the boy began to wonder if he couldn't venture to crawl in\nunder the goosey-gander's wing for this one night. Yes, that he might\nsafely do. It would do him good to get a little sleep. He should try to\nsee a little more of the dock and the ships after it had grown light.\n\nThe boy himself thought it was strange that he could keep still and wait\nuntil the next morning to see the ships. He certainly had not slept five\nminutes before he slipped out from under the wing and slid down the\nlightning-rod and the waterspout all the way down to the ground.\n\nSoon he stood on a big square which spread itself in front of the\nchurch. It was covered with round stones, and was just as difficult for\nhim to travel over, as it is for big people to walk on a tufted meadow.\nThose who are accustomed to live in the open--or way out in the\ncountry--always feel uneasy when they come into a city, where the houses\nstand straight and forbidding, and the streets are open, so that\neveryone can see who goes there. And it happened in the same way with\nthe boy. When he stood on the big Karlskrona square, and looked at the\nGerman church, and town hall, and the cathedral from which he had just\ndescended, he couldn't do anything but wish that he was back on the\ntower again with the geese.\n\nIt was a lucky thing that the square was entirely deserted. There wasn't\na human being about--unless he counted a statue that stood on a high\npedestal. The boy gazed long at the statue, which represented a big,\nbrawny man in a three-cornered hat, long waistcoat, knee-breeches and\ncoarse shoes, and wondered what kind of a one he was. He held a long\nstick in his hand, and he looked as if he would know how to make use of\nit, too--for he had an awfully severe countenance, with a big, hooked\nnose and an ugly mouth.\n\n\"What is that long-lipped thing doing here?\" said the boy at last. He\nhad never felt so small and insignificant as he did that night. He tried\nto jolly himself up a bit by saying something audacious. Then he thought\nno more about the statue, but betook himself to a wide street which led\ndown to the sea.\n\nBut the boy hadn't gone far before he heard that someone was following\nhim. Someone was walking behind him, who stamped on the stone pavement\nwith heavy footsteps, and pounded on the ground with a hard stick. It\nsounded as if the bronze man up in the square had gone out for a\npromenade.\n\nThe boy listened after the steps, while he ran down the street, and he\nbecame more and more convinced that it was the bronze man. The ground\ntrembled, and the houses shook. It couldn't be anyone but he, who walked\nso heavily, and the boy grew panic-stricken when he thought of what he\nhad just said to him. He did not dare to turn his head to find out if it\nreally was he.\n\n\"Perhaps he is only out walking for recreation,\" thought the boy.\n\"Surely he can't be offended with me for the words I spoke. They were\nnot at all badly meant.\"\n\nInstead of going straight on, and trying to get down to the dock, the\nboy turned into a side street which led east. First and foremost, he\nwanted to get away from the one who tramped after him.\n\nBut the next instant he heard that the bronze man had switched off to\nthe same street; and then the boy was so scared that he didn't know what\nhe would do with himself. And how hard it was to find any hiding places\nin a city where all the gates were closed! Then he saw on his right an\nold frame church, which lay a short distance away from the street in the\ncentre of a large grove. Not an instant did he pause to consider, but\nrushed on toward the church. \"If I can only get there, then I'll surely\nbe shielded from all harm,\" thought he.\n\nAs he ran forward, he suddenly caught sight of a man who stood on a\ngravel path and beckoned to him. \"There is certainly someone who will\nhelp me!\" thought the boy; he became intensely happy, and hurried off in\nthat direction. He was actually so frightened that the heart of him\nfairly thumped in his breast.\n\nBut when he came up to the man who stood on the edge of the gravel path,\nupon a low pedestal, he was absolutely thunderstruck. \"Surely, it can't\nhave been that one who beckoned to me!\" thought he; for he saw that the\nentire man was made of wood.\n\nHe stood there and stared at him. He was a thick-set man on short legs,\nwith a broad, ruddy countenance, shiny, black hair and full black beard.\nOn his head he wore a wooden hat; on his body, a brown wooden coat;\naround his waist, a black wooden belt; on his legs he had wide wooden\nknee-breeches and wooden stockings; and on his feet black wooden shoes.\nHe was newly painted and newly varnished, so that he glistened and shone\nin the moonlight. This undoubtedly had a good deal to do with giving him\nsuch a good-natured appearance, that the boy at once placed confidence\nin him.\n\nIn his left hand he held a wooden slate, and there the boy read:\n\n_Most humbly I beg you,\n  Though voice I may lack:\nCome drop a penny, do;\n  But lift my hat!_\n\nOh ho! the man was only a poor-box. The boy felt that he had been done.\nHe had expected that this should be something really remarkable. And now\nhe remembered that grandpa had also spoken of the wooden man, and said\nthat all the children in Karlskrona were so fond of him. And that must\nhave been true, for he, too, found it hard to part with the wooden man.\nHe had something so old-timy about him, that one could well take him to\nbe many hundred years old; and at the same time, he looked so strong and\nbold, and animated--just as one might imagine that folks looked in olden\ntimes.\n\nThe boy had so much fun looking at the wooden man, that he entirely\nforgot the one from whom he was fleeing. But now he heard him. He turned\nfrom the street and came into the churchyard. He followed him here too!\nWhere should the boy go?\n\nJust then he saw the wooden man bend down to him and stretch forth his\nbig, broad hand. It was impossible to believe anything but good of him;\nand with one jump, the boy stood in his hand. The wooden man lifted him\nto his hat--and stuck him under it.\n\nThe boy was just hidden, and the wooden man had just gotten his arm in\nits right place again, when the bronze man stopped in front of him and\nbanged the stick on the ground, so that the wooden man shook on his\npedestal. Thereupon the bronze man said in a strong and resonant voice:\n\"Who might this one be?\"\n\nThe wooden man's arm went up, so that it creaked in the old woodwork,\nand he touched his hat brim as he replied: \"Rosenbom, by Your Majesty's\nleave. Once upon a time boatswain on the man-of-war, _Dristigheten_;\nafter completed service, sexton at the Admiral's church--and, lately,\ncarved in wood and exhibited in the churchyard as a poor-box.\"\n\nThe boy gave a start when he heard that the wooden man said \"Your\nMajesty.\" For now, when he thought about it, he knew that the statue on\nthe square represented the one who had founded the city. It was probably\nno less an one than Charles the Eleventh himself, whom he had\nencountered.\n\n\"He gives a good account of himself,\" said the bronze man. \"Can he also\ntell me if he has seen a little brat who runs around in the city\nto-night? He's an impudent rascal, if I get hold of him, I'll teach him\nmanners!\" With that, he again pounded on the ground with his stick, and\nlooked fearfully angry.\n\n\"By Your Majesty's leave, I have seen him,\" said the wooden man; and the\nboy was so scared that he commenced to shake where he sat under the hat\nand looked at the bronze man through a crack in the wood. But he calmed\ndown when the wooden man continued: \"Your Majesty is on the wrong track.\nThat youngster certainly intended to run into the shipyard, and conceal\nhimself there.\"\n\n\"Does he say so, Rosenbom? Well then, don't stand still on the pedestal\nany longer but come with me and help me find him. Four eyes are better\nthan two, Rosenbom.\"\n\nBut the wooden man answered in a doleful voice: \"I would most humbly beg\nto be permitted to stay where I am. I look well and sleek because of the\npaint, but I'm old and mouldy, and cannot stand moving about.\"\n\nThe bronze man was not one of those who liked to be contradicted. \"What\nsort of notions are these? Come along, Rosenbom!\" Then he raised his\nstick and gave the other one a resounding whack on the shoulder. \"Does\nRosenbom not see that he holds together?\"\n\nWith that they broke off and walked forward on the streets of\nKarlskrona--large and mighty--until they came to a high gate, which led\nto the shipyard. Just outside and on guard walked one of the navy's\njack-tars, but the bronze man strutted past him and kicked the gate open\nwithout the jack-tar's pretending to notice it.\n\nAs soon as they had gotten into the shipyard, they saw before them a\nwide, expansive harbor separated by pile-bridges. In the different\nharbour basins, lay the warships, which looked bigger, and more\nawe-inspiring close to, like this, than lately, when the boy had seen\nthem from up above. \"Then it wasn't so crazy after all, to imagine that\nthey were sea-trolls,\" thought he.\n\n\"Where does Rosenbom think it most advisable for us to begin the\nsearch?\" said the bronze man.\n\n\"Such an one as he could most easily conceal himself in the hall of\nmodels,\" replied the wooden man.\n\nOn a narrow land-strip which stretched to the right from the gate, all\nalong the harbour, lay ancient structures. The bronze man walked over to\na building with low walls, small windows, and a conspicuous roof. He\npounded on the door with his stick until it burst open; and tramped up a\npair of worn-out steps. Soon they came into a large hall, which was\nfilled with tackled and full-rigged little ships. The boy understood\nwithout being told, that these were models for the ships which had been\nbuilt for the Swedish navy.\n\nThere were ships of many different varieties. There were old men-of-war,\nwhose sides bristled with cannon, and which had high structures fore and\naft, and their masts weighed down with a network of sails and ropes.\nThere were small island-boats with rowing-benches along the sides; there\nwere undecked cannon sloops and richly gilded frigates, which were\nmodels of the ones the kings had used on their travels. Finally, there\nwere also the heavy, broad armour-plated ships with towers and cannon\non deck--such as are in use nowadays; and narrow, shining torpedo boats\nwhich resembled long, slender fishes.\n\nWhen the boy was carried around among all this, he was awed. \"Fancy that\nsuch big, splendid ships have been built here in Sweden!\" he thought to\nhimself.\n\nHe had plenty of time to see all that was to be seen in there; for when\nthe bronze man saw the models, he forgot everything else. He examined\nthem all, from the first to the last, and asked about them. And\nRosenbom, the boatswain on the _Dristigheten_, told as much as he knew\nof the ships' builders, and of those who had manned them; and of the\nfates they had met. He told them about Chapman and Puke and Trolle; of\nHoagland and Svensksund--all the way along until 1809--after that he had\nnot been there.\n\nBoth he and the bronze man had the most to say about the fine old wooden\nships. The new battleships they didn't exactly appear to understand.\n\n\"I can hear that Rosenbom doesn't know anything about these new-fangled\nthings,\" said the bronze man. \"Therefore, let us go and look at\nsomething else; for this amuses me, Rosenbom.\"\n\nBy this time he had entirely given up his search for the boy, who felt\ncalm and secure where he sat in the wooden hat.\n\nThereupon both men wandered through the big establishment: sail-making\nshops, anchor smithy, machine and carpenter shops. They saw the mast\nsheers and the docks; the large magazines, the arsenal, the rope-bridge\nand the big discarded dock, which had been blasted in the rock. They\nwent out upon the pile-bridges, where the naval vessels lay moored,\nstepped on board and examined them like two old sea-dogs; wondered;\ndisapproved; approved; and became indignant.\n\nThe boy sat in safety under the wooden hat, and heard all about how they\nhad laboured and struggled in this place, to equip the navies which had\ngone out from here. He heard how life and blood had been risked; how the\nlast penny had been sacrificed to build the warships; how skilled men\nhad strained all their powers, in order to perfect these ships which\nhad been their fatherland's safeguard. A couple of times the tears came\nto the boy's eyes, as he heard all this.\n\nAnd the very last, they went into an open court, where the galley models\nof old men-of-war were grouped; and a more remarkable sight the boy had\nnever beheld; for these models had inconceivably powerful and\nterror-striking faces. They were big, fearless and savage: filled with\nthe same proud spirit that had fitted out the great ships. They were\nfrom another time than his. He thought that he shrivelled up before\nthem.\n\nBut when they came in here, the bronze man said to the wooden man:\n\"Take off thy hat, Rosenbom, for those that stand here! They have all\nfought for the fatherland.\"\n\nAnd Rosenbom--like the bronze man--had forgotten why they had begun this\ntramp. Without thinking, he lifted the wooden hat from his head and\nshouted:\n\n\"I take off my hat to the one who chose the harbour and founded the\nshipyard and recreated the navy; to the monarch who has awakened all\nthis into life!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Rosenbom! That was well spoken. Rosenbom is a fine man. But\nwhat is this, Rosenbom?\"\n\nFor there stood Nils Holgersson, right on the top of Rosenbom's bald\npate. He wasn't afraid any longer; but raised his white toboggan hood,\nand shouted: \"Hurrah for you, Longlip!\"\n\nThe bronze man struck the ground hard with his stick; but the boy never\nlearned what he had intended to do for now the sun ran up, and, at the\nsame time, both the bronze man and the wooden man vanished--as if they\nhad been made of mists. While he still stood and stared after them, the\nwild geese flew up from the church tower, and swayed back and forth over\nthe city. Instantly they caught sight of Nils Holgersson; and then the\nbig white one darted down from the sky and fetched him.\n\n\nTHE TRIP TO \u00c3\u0096LAND\n\n\n_Sunday, April third_.\n\nThe wild geese went out on a wooded island to feed. There they happened\nto run across a few gray geese, who were surprised to see them--since\nthey knew very well that their kinsmen, the wild geese, usually travel\nover the interior of the country.\n\nThey were curious and inquisitive, and wouldn't be satisfied with less\nthan that the wild geese should tell them all about the persecution\nwhich they had to endure from Smirre Fox. When they had finished, a\ngray goose, who appeared to be as old and as wise as Akka herself, said:\n\"It was a great misfortune for you that Smirre Fox was declared an\noutlaw in his own land. He'll be sure to keep his word, and follow you\nall the way up to Lapland. If I were in your place, I shouldn't travel\nnorth over Sm\u00c3\u00a5land, but would take the outside route over \u00c3\u0096land instead,\nso that he'll be thrown off the track entirely. To really mislead him,\nyou must remain for a couple of days on \u00c3\u0096land's southern point. There\nyou'll find lots of food and lots of company. I don't believe you'll\nregret it, if you go over there.\"\n\nIt was certainly very sensible advice, and the wild geese concluded to\nfollow it. As soon as they had eaten all they could hold, they started\non the trip to \u00c3\u0096land. None of them had ever been there before, but the\ngray goose had given them excellent directions. They only had to travel\ndirect south until they came to a large bird-track, which extended all\nalong the Blekinge coast. All the birds who had winter residences by the\nWest sea, and who now intended to travel to Finland and Russia, flew\nforward there--and, in passing, they were always in the habit of\nstopping at \u00c3\u0096land to rest. The wild geese would have no trouble in\nfinding guides.\n\nThat day it was perfectly still and warm--like a summer's day--the best\nweather in the world for a sea trip. The only grave thing about it was\nthat it was not quite clear, for the sky was gray and veiled. Here and\nthere were enormous mist-clouds which hung way down to the sea's outer\nedge, and obstructed the view.\n\nWhen the travellers had gotten away from the wooded island, the sea\nspread itself so smooth and mirror-like, that the boy as he looked down\nthought the water had disappeared. There was no longer any earth under\nhim. He had nothing but mist and sky around him. He grew very dizzy, and\nheld himself tight on the goose-back, more frightened than when he sat\nthere for the first time. It seemed as though he couldn't possibly hold\non; he must fall in some direction.\n\nIt was even worse when they reached the big bird-track, of which the\ngray goose had spoken. Actually, there came flock after flock flying in\nexactly the same direction. They seemed to follow a fixed route. There\nwere ducks and gray geese, surf-scoters and guillemots, loons and\npin-tail ducks and mergansers and grebes and oyster-catchers and\nsea-grouse. But now, when the boy leaned forward, and looked in the\ndirection where the sea ought to lie, he saw the whole bird procession\nreflected in the water. But he was so dizzy that he didn't understand\nhow this had come about: he thought that the whole bird procession flew\nwith their bellies upside down. Still he didn't wonder at this so much,\nfor he did not himself know which was up, and which was down.\n\nThe birds were tired out and impatient to get on. None of them shrieked\nor said a funny thing, and this made everything seem peculiarly unreal.\n\n\"Think, if we have travelled away from the earth!\" he said to himself.\n\"Think, if we are on our way up to heaven!\"\n\nHe saw nothing but mists and birds around him, and began to look upon it\nas reasonable that they were travelling heaven-ward. He was glad, and\nwondered what he should see up there. The dizziness passed all at once.\nHe was so exceedingly happy at the thought that he was on his way to\nheaven and was leaving this earth.\n\nJust about then he heard a couple of loud shots, and saw two white\nsmoke-columns ascend.\n\nThere was a sudden awakening, and an unrest among the birds. \"Hunters!\nHunters!\" they cried. \"Fly high! Fly away!\"\n\nThen the boy saw, finally, that they were travelling all the while over\nthe sea-coast, and that they certainly were not in heaven. In a long row\nlay small boats filled with hunters, who fired shot upon shot. The\nnearest bird-flocks hadn't noticed them in time. They had flown too low.\nSeveral dark bodies sank down toward the sea; and for every one that\nfell, there arose cries of anguish from the living.\n\nIt was strange for one who had but lately believed himself in heaven, to\nwake up suddenly to such fear and lamentation. Akka shot toward the\nheights as fast as she could, and the flock followed with the greatest\npossible speed. The wild geese got safely out of the way, but the boy\ncouldn't get over his amazement. \"To think that anyone could wish to\nshoot upon such as Akka and Yksi and Kaksi and the goosey-gander and the\nothers! Human beings had no conception of what they did.\"\n\nSo it bore on again, in the still air, and everything was as quiet as\nheretofore--with the exception that some of the tired birds called out\nevery now and then: \"Are we not there soon? Are you sure we're on the\nright track?\" Hereupon, those who flew in the centre answered: \"We are\nflying straight to \u00c3\u0096land; straight to \u00c3\u0096land.\"\n\nThe gray geese were tired out, and the loons flew around them. \"Don't be\nin such a rush!\" cried the ducks. \"You'll eat up all the food before we\nget there.\" \"Oh! there'll be enough for both you and us,\" answered the\nloons.\n\nBefore they had gotten so far that they saw \u00c3\u0096land, there came a light\nwind against them. It brought with it something that resembled immense\nclouds of white smoke--just as if there was a big fire somewhere.\n\nWhen the birds saw the first white spiral haze, they became uneasy and\nincreased their speed. But that which resembled smoke blew thicker and\nthicker, and at last it enveloped them altogether. They smelled no\nsmoke; and the smoke was not dark and dry, but white and damp. Suddenly\nthe boy understood that it was nothing but a mist.\n\nWhen the mist became so thick that one couldn't see a goose-length\nahead, the birds began to carry on like real lunatics. All these, who\nbefore had travelled forward in such perfect order, began to play in the\nmist. They flew hither and thither, to entice one another astray. \"Be\ncareful!\" they cried. \"You're only travelling round and round. Turn\nback, for pity's sake! You'll never get to \u00c3\u0096land in this way.\"\n\nThey all knew perfectly well where the island was, but they did their\nbest to lead each other astray. \"Look at those wagtails!\" rang out in\nthe mist. \"They are going back toward the North Sea!\" \"Have a care, wild\ngeese!\" shrieked someone from another direction. \"If you continue like\nthis, you'll get clear up to R\u00c3\u00bcgen.\"\n\nThere was, of course, no danger that the birds who were accustomed to\ntravel here would permit themselves to be lured in a wrong direction.\nBut the ones who had a hard time of it were the wild geese. The jesters\nobserved that they were uncertain as to the way, and did all they could\nto confuse them.\n\n\"Where do you intend to go, good people?\" called a swan. He came right\nup to Akka, and looked sympathetic and serious.\n\n\"We shall travel to \u00c3\u0096land; but we have never been there before,\" said\nAkka. She thought that this was a bird to be trusted.\n\n\"It's too bad,\" said the swan. \"They have lured you in the wrong\ndirection. You're on the road to Blekinge. Now come with me, and I'll\nput you right!\"\n\nAnd so he flew off with them; and when he had taken them so far away\nfrom the track that they heard no calls, he disappeared in the mist.\n\nThey flew around for a while at random. They had barely succeeded in\nfinding the birds again, when a duck approached them. \"It's best that\nyou lie down on the water until the mist clears,\" said the duck. \"It is\nevident that you are not accustomed to look out for yourselves on\njourneys.\"\n\nThose rogues succeeded in making Akka's head swim. As near as the boy\ncould make out, the wild geese flew round and round for a long time.\n\n\"Be careful! Can't you see that you are flying up and down?\" shouted a\nloon as he rushed by. The boy positively clutched the goosey-gander\naround the neck. This was something which he had feared for a long time.\n\nNo one can tell when they would have arrived, if they hadn't heard a\nrolling and muffled sound in the distance.\n\nThen Akka craned her neck, snapped hard with her wings, and rushed on at\nfull speed. Now she had something to go by. The gray goose had told her\nnot to light on \u00c3\u0096land's southern point, because there was a cannon\nthere, which the people used to shoot the mist with. Now she knew the\nway, and now no one in the world should lead her astray again.\n\n\n\u00c3\u0096LAND'S SOUTHERN POINT\n\n\n_April third to sixth_.\n\nOn the most southerly part of \u00c3\u0096land lies a royal demesne, which is\ncalled Ottenby. It is a rather large estate which extends from shore to\nshore, straight across the island; and it is remarkable because it has\nalways been a haunt for large bird-companies. In the seventeenth\ncentury, when the kings used to go over to \u00c3\u0096land to hunt, the entire\nestate was nothing but a deer park. In the eighteenth century there was\na stud there, where blooded race-horses were bred; and a sheep farm,\nwhere several hundred sheep were maintained. In our days you'll find\nneither blooded horses nor sheep at Ottenby. In place of them live\ngreat herds of young horses, which are to be used by the cavalry.\n\nIn all the land there is certainly no place that could be a better abode\nfor animals. Along the extreme eastern shore lies the old sheep meadow,\nwhich is a mile and a half long, and the largest meadow in all \u00c3\u0096land,\nwhere animals can graze and play and run about, as free as if they were\nin a wilderness. And there you will find the celebrated Ottenby grove\nwith the hundred-year-old oaks, which give shade from the sun, and\nshelter from the severe \u00c3\u0096land winds. And we must not forget the long\nOttenby wall, which stretches from shore to shore, and separates Ottenby\nfrom the rest of the island, so that the animals may know how far the\nold royal demesne extends, and be careful about getting in on other\nground, where they are not so well protected.\n\nYou'll find plenty of tame animals at Ottenby, but that isn't all. One\ncould almost believe that the wild ones also felt that on an old crown\nproperty both the wild and the tame ones can count upon shelter and\nprotection--since they venture there in such great numbers.\n\nBesides, there are still a few stags of the old descent left; and\nburrow-ducks and partridges love to live there, and it offers a resting\nplace, in the spring and late summer, for thousands of migratory birds.\nAbove all, it is the swampy eastern shore below the sheep meadow, where\nthe migratory birds alight, to rest and feed.\n\nWhen the wild geese and Nils Holgersson had finally found their way to\n\u00c3\u0096land, they came down, like all the rest, on the shore near the sheep\nmeadow. The mist lay thick over the island, just as it had over the sea.\nBut still the boy was amazed at all the birds which he discerned, only\non the little narrow stretch of shore which he could see.\n\nIt was a low sand-shore with stones and pools, and a lot of cast-up\nsea-weed. If the boy had been permitted to choose, it isn't likely that\nhe would have thought of alighting there; but the birds probably looked\nupon this as a veritable paradise. Ducks and geese walked about and fed\non the meadow; nearer the water, ran snipe, and other coast-birds. The\nloons lay in the sea and fished, but the life and movement was upon the\nlong sea-weed banks along the coast. There the birds stood side by side\nclose together and picked grub-worms--which must have been found there\nin limitless quantities for it was very evident that there was never any\ncomplaint over a lack of food.\n\nThe great majority were going to travel farther, and had only alighted\nto take a short rest; and as soon as the leader of a flock thought that\nhis comrades had recovered themselves sufficiently he said, \"If you are\nready now, we may as well move on.\"\n\n\"No, wait, wait! We haven't had anything like enough,\" said the\nfollowers.\n\n\"You surely don't believe that I intend to let you eat so much that you\nwill not be able to move?\" said the leader, and flapped his wings and\nstarted off. Along the outermost sea-weed banks lay a flock of swans.\nThey didn't bother about going on land, but rested themselves by lying\nand rocking on the water. Now and then they dived down with their necks\nand brought up food from the sea-bottom. When they had gotten hold of\nanything very good, they indulged in loud shouts that sounded like\ntrumpet calls.\n\nWhen the boy heard that there were swans on the shoals, he hurried out\nto the sea-weed banks. He had never before seen wild swans at close\nrange. He had luck on his side, so that he got close up to them.\n\nThe boy was not the only one who had heard the swans. Both the wild\ngeese and the gray geese and the loons swam out between the banks, laid\nthemselves in a ring around the swans and stared at them. The swans\nruffled their feathers, raised their wings like sails, and lifted their\nnecks high in the air. Occasionally one and another of them swam up to a\ngoose, or a great loon, or a diving-duck, and said a few words. And then\nit appeared as though the one addressed hardly dared raise his bill to\nreply.\n\nBut then there was a little loon--a tiny mischievous baggage--who\ncouldn't stand all this ceremony. He dived suddenly, and disappeared\nunder the water's edge. Soon after that, one of the swans let out a\nscream, and swam off so quickly that the water foamed. Then he stopped\nand began to look majestic once more. But soon, another one shrieked in\nthe same way as the first one, and then a third.\n\nThe little loon wasn't able to stay under water any longer, but appeared\non the water's edge, little and black and venomous. The swans rushed\ntoward him; but when they saw what a poor little thing it was, they\nturned abruptly--as if they considered themselves too good to quarrel\nwith him. Then the little loon dived again, and pinched their feet. It\ncertainly must have hurt; and the worst of it was, that they could not\nmaintain their dignity. At once they took a decided stand. They began to\nbeat the air with their wings so that it thundered; came forward a\nbit--as though they were running on the water--got wind under their\nwings, and raised themselves.\n\nWhen the swans were gone they were greatly missed; and those who had\nlately been amused by the little loon's antics scolded him for his\nthoughtlessness.\n\nThe boy walked toward land again. There he stationed himself to see how\nthe pool-snipe played. They resembled small storks; like these, they had\nlittle bodies, long legs and necks, and light, swaying movements; only\nthey were not gray, but brown. They stood in a long row on the shore\nwhere it was washed by waves. As soon as a wave rolled in, the whole row\nran backward; as soon as it receded, they followed it. And they kept\nthis up for hours.\n\nThe showiest of all the birds were the burrow-ducks. They were\nundoubtedly related to the ordinary ducks; for, like these, they too had\na thick-set body, broad bill, and webbed feet; but they were much more\nelaborately gotten up. The feather dress, itself, was white; around\ntheir necks they wore a broad gold band; the wing-mirror shone in green,\nred, and black; and the wing-edges were black, and the head was dark\ngreen and shimmered like satin.\n\nAs soon as any of these appeared on the shore, the others said: \"Now,\njust look at those things! They know how to tog themselves out.\" \"If\nthey were not so conspicuous, they wouldn't have to dig their nests in\nthe earth, but could lay above ground, like anyone else,\" said a brown\nmallard-duck. \"They may try as much as they please, still they'll never\nget anywhere with such noses,\" said a gray goose. And this was actually\ntrue. The burrow-ducks had a big knob on the base of the bill, which\nspoiled their appearance.\n\nClose to the shore, sea-gulls and sea-swallows moved forward on the\nwater and fished. \"What kind of fish are you catching?\" asked a wild\ngoose. \"It's a stickleback. It's \u00c3\u0096land stickleback. It's the best\nstickleback in the world,\" said a gull. \"Won't you taste of it?\" And he\nflew up to the goose, with his mouth full of the little fishes, and\nwanted to give her some. \"Ugh! Do you think that I eat such filth?\" said\nthe wild goose.\n\nThe next morning it was just as cloudy. The wild geese walked about on\nthe meadow and fed; but the boy had gone to the seashore to gather\nmussels. There were plenty of them; and when he thought that the next\nday, perhaps, they would be in some place where they couldn't get any\nfood at all, he concluded that he would try to make himself a little\nbag, which he could fill with mussels. He found an old sedge on the\nmeadow, which was strong and tough; and out of this he began to braid a\nknapsack. He worked at this for several hours, but he was well satisfied\nwith it when it was finished.\n\nAt dinner time all the wild geese came running and asked him if he had\nseen anything of the white goosey-gander. \"No, he has not been with me,\"\nsaid the boy. \"We had him with us all along until just lately,\" said\nAkka, \"but now we no longer know where he's to be found.\"\n\nThe boy jumped up, and was terribly frightened. He asked if any fox or\neagle had put in an appearance, or if any human being had been seen in\nthe neighbourhood. But no one had noticed anything dangerous. The\ngoosey-gander had probably lost his way in the mist.\n\nBut it was just as great a misfortune for the boy, in whatever way the\nwhite one had been lost, and he started off immediately to hunt for him.\nThe mist shielded him, so that he could run wherever he wished without\nbeing seen, but it also prevented him from seeing. He ran southward\nalong the shore--all the way down to the lighthouse and the mist cannon\non the island's extreme point. It was the same bird confusion\neverywhere, but no goosey-gander. He ventured over to Ottenby estate,\nand he searched every one of the old, hollow oaks in Ottenby grove, but\nhe saw no trace of the goosey-gander.\n\nHe searched until it began to grow dark. Then he had to turn back again\nto the eastern shore. He walked with heavy steps, and was fearfully\nblue. He didn't know what would become of him if he couldn't find the\ngoosey-gander. There was no one whom he could spare less.\n\nBut when he wandered over the sheep meadow, what was that big, white\nthing that came toward him in the mist if it wasn't the goosey-gander?\nHe was all right, and very glad that, at last, he had been able to find\nhis way back to the others. The mist had made him so dizzy, he said,\nthat he had wandered around on the big meadow all day long. The boy\nthrew his arms around his neck, for very joy, and begged him to take\ncare of himself, and not wander away from the others. And he promised,\npositively, that he never would do this again. No, never again.\n\nBut the next morning, when the boy went down to the beach and hunted for\nmussels, the geese came running and asked if he had seen the\ngoosey-gander. No, of course he hadn't. \"Well, then the goosey-gander\nwas lost again. He had gone astray in the mist, just as he had done the\nday before.\"\n\nThe boy ran off in great terror and began to search. He found one place\nwhere the Ottenby wall was so tumble-down that he could climb over it.\nLater, he went about, first on the shore which gradually widened and\nbecame so large that there was room for fields and meadows and\nfarms--then up on the flat highland, which lay in the middle of the\nisland, and where there were no buildings except windmills, and where\nthe turf was so thin that the white cement shone under it.\n\nMeanwhile, he could not find the goosey-gander; and as it drew on toward\nevening, and the boy must return to the beach, he couldn't believe\nanything but that his travelling companion was lost. He was so\ndepressed, he did not know what to do with himself.\n\nHe had just climbed over the wall again when he heard a stone crash down\nclose beside him. As he turned to see what it was, he thought that he\ncould distinguish something that moved on a stone pile which lay close\nto the wall. He stole nearer, and saw the goosey-gander come trudging\nwearily over the stone pile, with several long fibres in his mouth. The\ngoosey-gander didn't see the boy, and the boy did not call to him, but\nthought it advisable to find out first why the goosey-gander time and\nagain disappeared in this manner.\n\nAnd he soon learned the reason for it. Up in the stone pile lay a young\ngray goose, who cried with joy when the goosey-gander came. The boy\ncrept near, so that he heard what they said; then he found out that the\ngray goose had been wounded in one wing, so that she could not fly, and\nthat her flock had travelled away from her, and left her alone. She had\nbeen near death's door with hunger, when the white goosey-gander had\nheard her call, the other day, and had sought her out. Ever since, he\nhad been carrying food to her. They had both hoped that she would be\nwell before they left the island, but, as yet, she could neither fly nor\nwalk. She was very much worried over this, but he comforted her with the\nthought that he shouldn't travel for a long time. At last he bade her\ngood-night, and promised to come the next day.\n\nThe boy let the goosey-gander go; and as soon as he was gone, he stole,\nin turn, up to the stone heap. He was angry because he had been\ndeceived, and now he wanted to say to that gray goose that the\ngoosey-gander was his property. He was going to take the boy up to\nLapland, and there would be no talk of his staying here on her account.\nBut now, when he saw the young gray goose close to, he understood, not\nonly why the goosey-gander had gone and carried food to her for two\ndays, but also why he had not wished to mention that he had helped her.\nShe had the prettiest little head; her feather-dress was like soft\nsatin, and the eyes were mild and pleading.\n\nWhen she saw the boy, she wanted to run away; but the left wing was out\nof joint and dragged on the ground, so that it interfered with her\nmovements.\n\n\"You mustn't be afraid of me,\" said the boy, and didn't look nearly so\nangry as he had intended to appear. \"I'm Thumbietot, Morten\nGoosey-gander's comrade,\" he continued. Then he stood there, and didn't\nknow what he wanted to say.\n\nOccasionally one finds something among animals which makes one wonder\nwhat sort of creatures they really are. One is almost afraid that they\nmay be transformed human beings. It was something like this with the\ngray goose. As soon as Thumbietot said who he was, she lowered her neck\nand head very charmingly before him, and said in a voice that was so\npretty that he couldn't believe it was a goose who spoke: \"I am very\nglad that you have come here to help me. The white goosey-gander has\ntold me that no one is as wise and as good as you.\"\n\nShe said this with such dignity, that the boy grew really embarrassed.\n\"This surely can't be any bird,\" thought he. \"It is certainly some\nbewitched princess.\"\n\nHe was filled with a desire to help her, and ran his hand under the\nfeathers, and felt along the wing-bone. The bone was not broken, but\nthere was something wrong with the joint. He got his finger down into\nthe empty cavity. \"Be careful, now!\" he said; and got a firm grip on the\nbone-pipe and fitted it into the place where it ought to be. He did it\nvery quickly and well, considering it was the first time that he had\nattempted anything of the sort. But it must have hurt very much, for the\npoor young goose uttered a single shrill cry, and then sank down among\nthe stones without showing a sign of life.\n\nThe boy was terribly frightened. He had only wished to help her, and now\nshe was dead. He made a big jump from the stone pile, and ran away. He\nthought it was as though he had murdered a human being.\n\nThe next morning it was clear and free from mist, and Akka said that now\nthey should continue their travels. All the others were willing to go,\nbut the white goosey-gander made excuses. The boy understood well enough\nthat he didn't care to leave the gray goose. Akka did not listen to him,\nbut started off.\n\nThe boy jumped up on the goosey-gander's back, and the white one\nfollowed the flock--albeit slowly and unwillingly. The boy was mighty\nglad that they could fly away from the island. He was conscience-stricken\non account of the gray goose, and had not cared to tell the goosey-gander\nhow it had turned out when he had tried to cure her. It would probably be\nbest if Morten goosey-gander never found out about this, he thought,\nthough he wondered, at the same time, how the white one had the heart to\nleave the gray goose.\n\nBut suddenly the goosey-gander turned. The thought of the young gray\ngoose had overpowered him. It could go as it would with the Lapland\ntrip: he couldn't go with the others when he knew that she lay alone and\nill, and would starve to death.\n\nWith a few wing-strokes he was over the stone pile; but then, there lay\nno young gray goose between the stones. \"Dunfin! Dunfin! Where art\nthou?\" called the goosey-gander.\n\n\"The fox has probably been here and taken her,\" thought the boy. But at\nthat moment he heard a pretty voice answer the goosey-gander. \"Here am\nI, goosey-gander; here am I! I have only been taking a morning bath.\"\nAnd up from the water came the little gray goose--fresh and in good\ntrim--and told how Thumbietot had pulled her wing into place, and that\nshe was entirely well, and ready to follow them on the journey.\n\nThe drops of water lay like pearl-dew on her shimmery satin-like\nfeathers, and Thumbietot thought once again that she was a real little\nprincess.\n\n\nTHE BIG BUTTERFLY\n\n\n_Wednesday, April sixth_.\n\nThe geese travelled alongside the coast of the long island, which lay\ndistinctly visible under them. The boy felt happy and light of heart\nduring the trip. He was just as pleased and well satisfied as he had\nbeen glum and depressed the day before, when he roamed around down on\nthe island, and hunted for the goosey-gander.\n\nHe saw now that the interior of the island consisted of a barren high\nplain, with a wreath of fertile land along the coast; and he began to\ncomprehend the meaning of something which he had heard the other\nevening.\n\nHe had just seated himself to rest a bit by one of the many windmills on\nthe highland, when a couple of shepherds came along with the dogs beside\nthem, and a large herd of sheep in their train. The boy had not been\nafraid because he was well concealed under the windmill stairs. But as\nit turned out, the shepherds came and seated themselves on the same\nstairway, and then there was nothing for him to do but to keep perfectly\nstill.\n\nOne of the shepherds was young, and looked about as folks do mostly; the\nother was an old queer one. His body was large and knotty, but the head\nwas small, and the face had sensitive and delicate features. It appeared\nas though the body and head didn't want to fit together at all.\n\nOne moment he sat silent and gazed into the mist, with an unutterably\nweary expression. Then he began to talk to his companion. Then the other\none took out some bread and cheese from his knapsack, to eat his evening\nmeal. He answered scarcely anything, but listened very patiently, just\nas if he were thinking: \"I might as well give you the pleasure of\nletting you chatter a while.\"\n\n\"Now I shall tell you something, Eric,\" said the old shepherd. \"I have\nfigured out that in former days, when both human beings and animals were\nmuch larger than they are now, that the butterflies, too, must have been\nuncommonly large. And once there was a butterfly that was many miles\nlong, and had wings as wide as seas. Those wings were blue, and shone\nlike silver, and so gorgeous that, when the butterfly was out flying,\nall the other animals stood still and stared at it. It had this\ndrawback, however, that it was too large. The wings had hard work to\ncarry it. But probably all would have gone very well, if the butterfly\nhad been wise enough to remain on the hillside. But it wasn't; it\nventured out over the East sea. And it hadn't gotten very far before the\nstorm came along and began to tear at its wings. Well, it's easy to\nunderstand, Eric, how things would go when the East sea storm commenced\nto wrestle with frail butterfly-wings. It wasn't long before they were\ntorn away and scattered; and then, of course, the poor butterfly fell\ninto the sea. At first it was tossed backward and forward on the\nbillows, and then it was stranded upon a few cliff-foundations outside\nof Sm\u00c3\u00a5land. And there it lay--as large and long as it was.\n\n\"Now I think, Eric, that if the butterfly had dropped on land, it would\nsoon have rotted and fallen apart. But since it fell into the sea, it\nwas soaked through and through with lime, and became as hard as a stone.\nYou know, of course, that we have found stones on the shore which were\nnothing but petrified worms. Now I believe that it went the same way\nwith the big butterfly-body. I believe that it turned where it lay into\na long, narrow mountain out in the East sea. Don't you?\"\n\nHe paused for a reply, and the other one nodded to him. \"Go on, so I may\nhear what you are driving at,\" said he.\n\n\"And mark you, Eric, that this very \u00c3\u0096land, upon which you and I live, is\nnothing else than the old butterfly-body. If one only thinks about it,\none can observe that the island is a butterfly. Toward the north, the\nslender fore-body and the round head can be seen, and toward the south,\none sees the back-body--which first broadens out, and then narrows to a\nsharp point.\"\n\nHere he paused once more and looked at his companion rather anxiously to\nsee how he would take this assertion. But the young man kept on eating\nwith the utmost calm, and nodded to him to continue.\n\n\"As soon as the butterfly had been changed into a limestone rock, many\ndifferent kinds of seeds of herbs and trees came travelling with the\nwinds, and wanted to take root on it. It was a long time before anything\nbut sedge could grow there. Then came sheep sorrel, and the rock-rose\nand thorn-brush. But even to-day there is not so much growth on Alvaret,\nthat the mountain is well covered, but it shines through here and there.\nAnd no one can think of ploughing and sowing up here, where the\nearth-crust is so thin. But if you will admit that Alvaret and the\nstrongholds around it, are made of the butterfly-body, then you may well\nhave the right to question where that land which lies beneath the\nstrongholds came from.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is just that,\" said he who was eating. \"That I should indeed\nlike to know.\"\n\n\"Well, you must remember that \u00c3\u0096land has lain in the sea for a good many\nyears, and in the course of time all the things which tumble around with\nthe waves--sea-weed and sand and clams--have gathered around it, and\nremained lying there. And then, stone and gravel have fallen down from\nboth the eastern and western strongholds. In this way the island has\nacquired broad shores, where grain and flowers and trees can grow.\n\n\"Up here, on the hard butterfly-back, only sheep and cows and little\nhorses go about. Only lapwings and plover live here, and there are no\nbuildings except windmills and a few stone huts, where we shepherds\ncrawl in. But down on the coast lie big villages and churches and\nparishes and fishing hamlets and a whole city.\"\n\nHe looked questioningly at the other one. This one had finished his\nmeal, and was tying the food-sack together. \"I wonder where you will end\nwith all this,\" said he.\n\n\"It is only this that I want to know,\" said the shepherd, as he lowered\nhis voice so that he almost whispered the words, and looked into the\nmist with his small eyes, which appeared to be worn out from spying\nafter all that which does not exist. \"Only this I want to know: if the\npeasants who live on the built-up farms beneath the strongholds, or the\nfishermen who take the small herring from the sea, or the merchants in\nBorgholm, or the bathing guests who come here every summer, or the\ntourists who wander around in Borgholm's old castle ruin, or the\nsportsmen who come here in the fall to hunt partridges, or the painters\nwho sit here on Alvaret and paint the sheep and windmills--I should like\nto know if any of them understand that this island has been a butterfly\nwhich flew about with great shimmery wings.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the young shepherd, suddenly. \"It should have occurred to\nsome of them, as they sat on the edge of the stronghold of an evening,\nand heard the nightingales trill in the groves below them, and looked\nover Kalmar Sound, that this island could not have come into existence\nin the same way as the others.\"\n\n\"I want to ask,\" said the old one, \"if no one has had the desire to give\nwings to the windmills--so large that they could reach to heaven, so\nlarge that they could lift the whole island out of the sea and let it\nfly like a butterfly among butterflies.\"\n\n\"It may be possible that there is something in what you say,\" said the\nyoung one; \"for on summer nights, when the heavens widen and open over\nthe island, I have sometimes thought that it was as if it wanted to\nraise itself from the sea, and fly away.\"\n\nBut when the old one had finally gotten the young one to talk, he didn't\nlisten to him very much. \"I would like to know,\" the old one said in a\nlow tone, \"if anyone can explain why one feels such a longing up here on\nAlvaret. I have felt it every day of my life; and I think it preys upon\neach and every one who must go about here. I want to know if no one else\nhas understood that all this wistfulness is caused by the fact that the\nwhole island is a butterfly that longs for its wings.\"\n\n\nLITTLE KARL'S ISLAND\n\n\nTHE STORM\n\n_Friday, April eighth_.\n\nThe wild geese had spent the night on \u00c3\u0096land's northern point, and were\nnow on their way to the continent. A strong south wind blew over Kalmar\nSound, and they had been thrown northward. Still they worked their way\ntoward land with good speed. But when they were nearing the first\nislands a powerful rumbling was heard, as if a lot of strong-winged\nbirds had come flying; and the water under them, all at once, became\nperfectly black. Akka drew in her wings so suddenly that she almost\nstood still in the air. Thereupon, she lowered herself to light on the\nedge of the sea. But before the geese had reached the water, the west\nstorm caught up with them. Already, it drove before it fogs, salt scum\nand small birds; it also snatched with it the wild geese, threw them on\nend, and cast them toward the sea.\n\nIt was a rough storm. The wild geese tried to turn back, time and again,\nbut they couldn't do it and were driven out toward the East sea. The\nstorm had already blown them past \u00c3\u0096land, and the sea lay before\nthem--empty and desolate. There was nothing for them to do but to keep\nout of the water.\n\nWhen Akka observed that they were unable to turn back she thought that\nit was needless to let the storm drive them over the entire East sea.\nTherefore she sank down to the water. Now the sea was raging, and\nincreased in violence with every second. The sea-green billows rolled\nforward, with seething foam on their crests. Each one surged higher than\nthe other. It was as though they raced with each other, to see which\ncould foam the wildest. But the wild geese were not afraid of the\nswells. On the contrary, this seemed to afford them much pleasure. They\ndid not strain themselves with swimming, but lay and let themselves be\nwashed up with the wave-crests, and down in the water-dales, and had\njust as much fun as children in a swing. Their only anxiety was that the\nflock should be separated. The few land-birds who drove by, up in the\nstorm, cried with envy: \"There is no danger for you who can swim.\"\n\nBut the wild geese were certainly not out of all danger. In the first\nplace, the rocking made them helplessly sleepy. They wished continually\nto turn their heads backward, poke their bills under their wings, and go\nto sleep. Nothing can be more dangerous than to fall asleep in this way;\nand Akka called out all the while: \"Don't go to sleep, wild geese! He\nthat falls asleep will get away from the flock. He that gets away from\nthe flock is lost.\"\n\nDespite all attempts at resistance one after another fell asleep; and\nAkka herself came pretty near dozing off, when she suddenly saw\nsomething round and dark rise on the top of a wave. \"Seals! Seals!\nSeals!\" cried Akka in a high, shrill voice, and raised herself up in the\nair with resounding wing-strokes. It was just at the crucial moment.\nBefore the last wild goose had time to come up from the water, the seals\nwere so close to her that they made a grab for her feet.\n\nThen the wild geese were once more up in the storm which drove them\nbefore it out to sea. No rest did it allow either itself or the wild\ngeese; and no land did they see--only desolate sea.\n\nThey lit on the water again, as soon as they dared venture. But when\nthey had rocked upon the waves for a while, they became sleepy again.\nAnd when they fell asleep, the seals came swimming. If old Akka had not\nbeen so wakeful, not one of them would have escaped.\n\nAll day the storm raged; and it caused fearful havoc among the crowds of\nlittle birds, which at this time of year were migrating. Some were\ndriven from their course to foreign lands, where they died of\nstarvation; others became so exhausted that they sank down in the sea\nand were drowned. Many were crushed against the cliff-walls, and many\nbecame a prey for the seals.\n\nThe storm continued all day, and, at last, Akka began to wonder if she\nand her flock would perish. They were now dead tired, and nowhere did\nthey see any place where they might rest. Toward evening she no longer\ndared to lie down on the sea, because now it filled up all of a sudden\nwith large ice-cakes, which struck against each other, and she feared\nthey should be crushed between these. A couple of times the wild geese\ntried to stand on the ice-crust; but one time the wild storm swept them\ninto the water; another time, the merciless seals came creeping up on\nthe ice.\n\nAt sundown the wild geese were once more up in the air. They flew\non--fearful for the night. The darkness seemed to come upon them much\ntoo quickly this night--which was so full of dangers.\n\nIt was terrible that they, as yet, saw no land. How would it go with\nthem if they were forced to stay out on the sea all night? They would\neither be crushed between the ice-cakes or devoured by seals or\nseparated by the storm.\n\nThe heavens were cloud-bedecked, the moon hid itself, and the darkness\ncame quickly. At the same time all nature was filled with a horror which\ncaused the most courageous hearts to quail. Distressed bird-travellers'\ncries had sounded over the sea all day long, without anyone having paid\nthe slightest attention to them; but now, when one no longer saw who it\nwas that uttered them, they seemed mournful and terrifying. Down on the\nsea, the ice-drifts crashed against each other with a loud rumbling\nnoise. The seals tuned up their wild hunting songs. It was as though\nheaven and earth were, about to clash.\n\nTHE SHEEP\n\nThe boy sat for a moment and looked down into the sea. Suddenly he\nthought that it began to roar louder than ever. He looked up. Right in\nfront of him--only a couple of metres away--stood a rugged and bare\nmountain-wall. At its base the waves dashed into a foaming spray. The\nwild geese flew straight toward the cliff, and the boy did not see how\nthey could avoid being dashed to pieces against it. Hardly had he\nwondered that Akka hadn't seen the danger in time, when they were over\nby the mountain. Then he also noticed that in front of them was the\nhalf-round entrance to a grotto. Into this the geese steered; and the\nnext moment they were safe.\n\nThe first thing the wild geese thought of--before they gave themselves\ntime to rejoice over their safety--was to see if all their comrades were\nalso harboured. Yes, there were Akka, Iksi, Kolmi, Nelja, Viisi, Knusi,\nall the six goslings, the goosey-gander, Dunfin and Thumbietot; but\nKaksi from Nuolja, the first left-hand goose, was missing--and no one\nknew anything about her fate.\n\nWhen the wild geese discovered that no one but Kaksi had been separated\nfrom the flock, they took the matter lightly. Kaksi was old and wise.\nShe knew all their byways and their habits, and she, of course, would\nknow how to find her way back to them.\n\nThen the wild geese began to look around in the cave. Enough daylight\ncame in through the opening, so that they could see the grotto was both\ndeep and wide. They were delighted to think they had found such a fine\nnight harbour, when one of them caught sight of some shining, green\ndots, which glittered in a dark corner. \"These are eyes!\" cried Akka.\n\"There are big animals in here.\" They rushed toward the opening, but\nThumbietot called to them: \"There is nothing to run away from! It's only\na few sheep who are lying alongside the grotto wall.\"\n\nWhen the wild geese had accustomed themselves to the dim daylight in the\ngrotto, they saw the sheep very distinctly. The grown-up ones might be\nabout as many as there were geese; but beside these there were a few\nlittle lambs. An old ram with long, twisted horns appeared to be the\nmost lordly one of the flock. The wild geese went up to him with much\nbowing and scraping. \"Well met in the wilderness!\" they greeted, but the\nbig ram lay still, and did not speak a word of welcome.\n\nThen the wild geese thought that the sheep were displeased because they\nhad taken shelter in their grotto. \"It is perhaps not permissible that\nwe have come in here?\" said Akka. \"But we cannot help it, for we are\nwind-driven. We have wandered about in the storm all day, and it would\nbe very good to be allowed to stop here to-night.\" After that a long\ntime passed before any of the sheep answered with words; but, on the\nother hand, it could be heard distinctly that a pair of them heaved deep\nsighs. Akka knew, to be sure, that sheep are always shy and peculiar;\nbut these seemed to have no idea of how they should conduct themselves.\nFinally an old ewe, who had a long and pathetic face and a doleful\nvoice, said: \"There isn't one among us that refuses to let you stay; but\nthis is a house of mourning, and we cannot receive guests as we did in\nformer days.\" \"You needn't worry about anything of that sort,\" said\nAkka. \"If you knew what we have endured this day, you would surely\nunderstand that we are satisfied if we only get a safe spot to sleep\non.\"\n\nWhen Akka said this, the old ewe raised herself. \"I believe that it\nwould be better for you to fly about in the worst storm than to stop\nhere. But, at least, you shall not go from here before we have had the\nprivilege of offering you the best hospitality which the house affords.\"\n\nShe conducted them to a hollow in the ground, which was filled with\nwater. Beside it lay a pile of bait and husks and chaff; and she bade\nthem make the most of these. \"We have had a severe snow-winter this\nyear, on the island,\" she said. \"The peasants who own us came out to us\nwith hay and oaten straw, so we shouldn't starve to death. And this\ntrash is all there is left of the good cheer.\"\n\nThe geese rushed to the food instantly. They thought that they had fared\nwell, and were in their best humour. They must have observed, of course,\nthat the sheep were anxious; but they knew how easily scared sheep\ngenerally are, and didn't believe there was any actual danger on foot.\nAs soon as they had eaten, they intended to stand up to sleep as usual.\nBut then the big ram got up, and walked over to them. The geese thought\nthat they had never seen a sheep with such big and coarse horns. In\nother respects, also, he was noticeable. He had a high, rolling\nforehead, intelligent eyes, and a good bearing--as though he were a\nproud and courageous animal.\n\n\"I cannot assume the responsibility of letting you geese remain, without\ntelling you that it is unsafe here,\" said he. \"We cannot receive night\nguests just now.\" At last Akka began to comprehend that this was\nserious. \"We shall go away, since you really wish it,\" said she. \"But\nwon't you tell us first, what it is that troubles you? We know nothing\nabout it. We do not even know where we are.\" \"This is Little Karl's\nIsland!\" said the ram. \"It lies outside of Gottland, and only sheep and\nseabirds live here.\" \"Perhaps you are wild sheep?\" said Akka. \"We're not\nfar removed from it,\" replied the ram. \"We have nothing to do with human\nbeings. It's an old agreement between us and some peasants on a farm in\nGottland, that they shall supply us with fodder in case we have\nsnow-winter; and as a recompense they are permitted to take away those\nof us who become superfluous. The island is small, so it cannot feed\nvery many of us. But otherwise we take care of ourselves all the year\nround, and we do not live in houses with doors and locks, but we reside\nin grottoes like these.\"\n\n\"Do you stay out here in the winter as well?\" asked Akka, surprised. \"We\ndo,\" answered the ram. \"We have good fodder up here on the mountain, all\nthe year around.\" \"I think it sounds as if you might have it better than\nother sheep,\" said Akka. \"But what is the misfortune that has befallen\nyou?\" \"It was bitter cold last winter. The sea froze, and then three\nfoxes came over here on the ice, and here they have been ever since.\nOtherwise, there are no dangerous animals here on the island.\" \"Oh, oh!\ndo foxes dare to attack such as you?\" \"Oh, no! not during the day; then\nI can protect myself and mine,\" said the ram, shaking his horns. \"But\nthey sneak upon us at night when we sleep in the grottoes. We try to\nkeep awake, but one must sleep some of the time; and then they come upon\nus. They have already killed every sheep in the other grottoes, and\nthere were herds that were just as large as mine.\"\n\n\"It isn't pleasant to tell that we are so helpless,\" said the old ewe.\n\"We cannot help ourselves any better than if we were tame sheep.\" \"Do\nyou think that they will come here to-night?\" asked Akka. \"There is\nnothing else in store for us,\" answered the old ewe. \"They were here\nlast night, and stole a lamb from us. They'll be sure to come again, as\nlong as there are any of us alive. This is what they have done in the\nother places.\" \"But if they are allowed to keep this up, you'll become\nentirely exterminated,\" said Akka. \"Oh! it won't be long before it is\nall over with the sheep on Little Karl's Island,\" said the ewe.\n\nAkka stood there hesitatingly. It was not pleasant, by any means, to\nventure out in the storm again, and it wasn't good to remain in a house\nwhere such guests were expected. When she had pondered a while, she\nturned to Thumbietot. \"I wonder if you will help us, as you have done so\nmany times before,\" said she. Yes, that he would like to do, he replied.\n\"It is a pity for you not to get any sleep!\" said the wild goose, \"but I\nwonder if you are able to keep awake until the foxes come, and then to\nawaken us, so we may fly away.\" The boy was so very glad of this--for\nanything was better than to go out in the storm again--so he promised\nto keep awake. He went down to the grotto opening, crawled in behind a\nstone, that he might be shielded from the storm, and sat down to watch.\n\nWhen the boy had been sitting there a while, the storm seemed to abate.\nThe sky grew clear, and the moonlight began to play on the waves. The\nboy stepped to the opening to look out. The grotto was rather high up on\nthe mountain. A narrow path led to it. It was probably here that he must\nawait the foxes.\n\nAs yet he saw no foxes; but, on the other hand, there was something\nwhich, for the moment, terrified him much more. On the land-strip below\nthe mountain stood some giants, or other stone-trolls--or perhaps they\nwere actual human beings. At first he thought that he was dreaming, but\nnow he was positive that he had not fallen asleep. He saw the big men so\ndistinctly that it couldn't be an illusion. Some of them stood on the\nland-strip, and others right on the mountain just as if they intended to\nclimb it. Some had big, thick heads; others had no heads at all. Some\nwere one-armed, and some had humps both before and behind. He had never\nseen anything so extraordinary.\n\nThe boy stood and worked himself into a state of panic because of those\ntrolls, so that he almost forgot to keep his eye peeled for the foxes.\nBut now he heard a claw scrape against a stone. He saw three foxes\ncoming up the steep; and as soon as he knew that he had something real\nto deal with, he was calm again, and not the least bit scared. It struck\nhim that it was a pity to awaken only the geese, and to leave the sheep\nto their fate. He thought he would like to arrange things some other\nway.\n\nHe ran quickly to the other end of the grotto, shook the big ram's horns\nuntil he awoke, and, at the same time, swung himself upon his back. \"Get\nup, sheep, and well try to frighten the foxes a bit!\" said the boy.\n\nHe had tried to be as quiet as possible, but the foxes must have heard\nsome noise; for when they came up to the mouth of the grotto they\nstopped and deliberated. \"It was certainly someone in there that\nmoved,\" said one. \"I wonder if they are awake.\" \"Oh, go ahead, you!\"\nsaid another. \"At all events, they can't do anything to us.\"\n\nWhen they came farther in, in the grotto, they stopped and sniffed. \"Who\nshall we take to-night?\" whispered the one who went first. \"To-night we\nwill take the big ram,\" said the last. \"After that, we'll have easy work\nwith the rest.\"\n\nThe boy sat on the old ram's back and saw how they sneaked along. \"Now\nbutt straight forward!\" whispered the boy. The ram butted, and the first\nfox was thrust--top over tail--back to the opening. \"Now butt to the\nleft!\" said the boy, and turned the big ram's head in that direction.\nThe ram measured a terrific assault that caught the second fox in the\nside. He rolled around several times before he got to his feet again and\nmade his escape. The boy had wished that the third one, too, might have\ngotten a bump, but this one had already gone.\n\n\"Now I think that they've had enough for to-night,\" said the boy. \"I\nthink so too,\" said the big ram. \"Now lie down on my back, and creep\ninto the wool! You deserve to have it warm and comfortable, after all\nthe wind and storm that you have been out in.\"\n\nHELL'S HOLE\n\nThe next day the big ram went around with the boy on his back, and\nshowed him the island. It consisted of a single massive mountain. It was\nlike a large house with perpendicular walls and a flat roof. First the\nram walked up on the mountain-roof and showed the boy the good grazing\nlands there, and he had to admit that the island seemed to be especially\ncreated for sheep. There wasn't much else than sheep-sorrel and such\nlittle spicy growths as sheep are fond of that grew on the mountain.\n\nBut indeed there was something beside sheep fodder to look at, for one\nwho had gotten well up on the steep. To begin with, the largest part of\nthe sea--which now lay blue and sunlit, and rolled forward in glittering\nswells--was visible. Only upon one and another point, did the foam spray\nup. To the east lay Gottland, with even and long-stretched coast; and to\nthe southwest lay Great Karl's Island, which was built on the same plan\nas the little island. When the ram walked to the very edge of the\nmountain roof, so the boy could look down the mountain walls, he noticed\nthat they were simply filled with birds' nests; and in the blue sea\nbeneath him, lay surf-scoters and eider-ducks and kittiwakes and\nguillemots and razor-bills--so pretty and peaceful--busying themselves\nwith fishing for small herring.\n\n\"This is really a favoured land,\" said the boy. \"You live in a pretty\nplace, you sheep.\" \"Oh, yes! it's pretty enough here,\" said the big ram.\nIt was as if he wished to add something; but he did not, only sighed.\n\"If you go about here alone you must look out for the crevices which run\nall around the mountain,\" he continued after a little. And this was a\ngood warning, for there were deep and broad crevices in several places.\nThe largest of them was called Hell's Hole. That crevice was many\nfathoms deep and nearly one fathom wide. \"If anyone fell down there, it\nwould certainly be the last of him,\" said the big ram. The boy thought\nit sounded as if he had a special meaning in what he said.\n\nThen he conducted the boy down to the narrow strip of shore. Now he\ncould see those giants which had frightened him the night before, at\nclose range. They were nothing but tall rock-pillars. The big ram called\nthem \"cliffs.\" The boy couldn't see enough of them. He thought that if\nthere had ever been any trolls who had turned into stone they ought to\nlook just like that.\n\nAlthough it was pretty down on the shore, the boy liked it still better\non the mountain height. It was ghastly down here; for everywhere they\ncame across dead sheep. It was here that the foxes had held their\norgies. He saw skeletons whose flesh had been eaten, and bodies that\nwere half-eaten, and others which they had scarcely tasted, but had\nallowed to lie untouched. It was heart-rending to see how the wild\nbeasts had thrown themselves upon the sheep just for sport--just to\nhunt them and tear them to death.\n\nThe big ram did not pause in front of the dead, but walked by them in\nsilence. But the boy, meanwhile, could not help seeing all the horror.\n\nThen the big ram went up on the mountain height again; but when he was\nthere he stopped and said: \"If someone who is capable and wise could see\nall the misery which prevails here, he surely would not be able to rest\nuntil these foxes had been punished.\" \"The foxes must live, too,\" said\nthe boy. \"Yes,\" said the big ram, \"those who do not tear in pieces more\nanimals than they need for their sustenance, they may as well live. But\nthese are felons.\" \"The peasants who own the island ought to come here\nand help you,\" insisted the boy. \"They have rowed over a number of\ntimes,\" replied the ram, \"but the foxes always hid themselves in the\ngrottoes and crevices, so they could not get near them, to shoot them.\"\n\"You surely cannot mean, father, that a poor little creature like me\nshould be able to get at them, when neither you nor the peasants have\nsucceeded in getting the better of them.\" \"He that is little and spry\ncan put many things to rights,\" said the big ram.\n\nThey talked no more about this, and the boy went over and seated himself\namong the wild geese who fed on the highland. Although he had not cared\nto show his feelings before the ram, he was very sad on the sheep's\naccount, and he would have been glad to help them. \"I can at least talk\nwith Akka and Morten goosey-gander about the matter,\" thought he.\n\"Perhaps they can help me with a good suggestion.\"\n\nA little later the white goosey-gander took the boy on his back and went\nover the mountain plain, and in the direction of Hell's Hole at that.\n\nHe wandered, care-free, on the open mountain roof--apparently\nunconscious of how large and white he was. He didn't seek protection\nbehind tufts, or any other protuberances, but went straight ahead. It\nwas strange that he was not more careful, for it was apparent that he\nhad fared badly in yesterday's storm. He limped on his right leg, and\nthe left wing hung and dragged as if it might be broken.\n\nHe acted as if there were no danger, pecked at a grass-blade here and\nanother there, and did not look about him in any direction. The boy lay\nstretched out full length on the goose-back, and looked up toward the\nblue sky. He was so accustomed to riding now, that he could both stand\nand lie down on the goose-back.\n\nWhen the goosey-gander and the boy were so care-free, they did not\nobserve, of course, that the three foxes had come up on the mountain\nplain.\n\nAnd the foxes, who knew that it was well-nigh impossible to take the\nlife of a goose on an open plain, thought at first that they wouldn't\nchase after the goosey-gander. But as they had nothing else to do, they\nfinally sneaked down on one of the long passes, and tried to steal up to\nhim. They went about it so cautiously that the goosey-gander couldn't\nsee a shadow of them.\n\nThey were not far off when the goosey-gander made an attempt to raise\nhimself into the air. He spread his wings, but he did not succeed in\nlifting himself. When the foxes seemed to grasp the fact that he\ncouldn't fly, they hurried forward with greater eagerness than before.\nThey no longer concealed themselves in the cleft, but came up on the\nhighland. They hurried as fast as they could, behind tufts and hollows,\nand came nearer and nearer the goosey-gander--without his seeming to\nnotice that he was being hunted. At last the foxes were so near that\nthey could make the final leap. Simultaneously, all three threw\nthemselves with one long jump at the goosey-gander.\n\nBut still at the last moment he must have noticed something, for he ran\nout of the way, so the foxes missed him. This, at any rate, didn't mean\nvery much, for the goosey-gander only had a couple of metres headway,\nand, in the bargain, he limped. Anyway, the poor thing ran ahead as fast\nas he could.\n\nThe boy sat upon the goose-back--backward--and shrieked and called to\nthe foxes. \"You have eaten yourselves too fat on mutton, foxes. You\ncan't catch up with a goose even.\" He teased them so that they became\ncrazed with rage and thought only of rushing forward.\n\nThe white one ran right straight to the big cleft. When he was there, he\nmade one stroke with his wings, and got over. Just then the foxes were\nalmost upon him.\n\nThe goosey-gander hurried on with the same haste as before, even after\nhe had gotten across Hell's Hole. But he had hardly been running two\nmetres before the boy patted him on the neck, and said: \"Now you can\nstop, goosey-gander.\"\n\nAt that instant they heard a number of wild howls behind them, and a\nscraping of claws, and heavy falls. But of the foxes they saw nothing\nmore.\n\nThe next morning the lighthouse keeper on Great Karl's Island found a\nbit of bark poked under the entrance-door, and on it had been cut, in\nslanting, angular letters: \"The foxes on the little island have fallen\ndown into Hell's Hole. Take care of them!\"\n\nAnd this the lighthouse keeper did, too.\n\n\nTWO CITIES\n\n\nTHE CITY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA\n\n_Saturday, April ninth_.\n\nIt was a calm and clear night. The wild geese did not trouble themselves\nto seek shelter in any of the grottoes, but stood and slept upon the\nmountain top; and the boy had lain down in the short, dry grass beside\nthe geese.\n\nIt was bright moonlight that night; so bright that it was difficult for\nthe boy to go to sleep. He lay there and thought about just how long he\nhad been away from home; and he figured out that it was three weeks\nsince he had started on the trip. At the same time he remembered that\nthis was Easter-eve.\n\n\"It is to-night that all the witches come home from Blakulla,\" thought\nhe, and laughed to himself. For he was just a little afraid of both the\nsea-nymph and the elf, but he didn't believe in witches the least little\nbit.\n\nIf there had been any witches out that night, he should have seen them,\nto be sure. It was so light in the heavens that not the tiniest black\nspeck could move in the air without his seeing it.\n\nWhile the boy lay there with his nose in the air and thought about this,\nhis eye rested on something lovely! The moon's disc was whole and round,\nand rather high, and over it a big bird came flying. He did not fly past\nthe moon, but he moved just as though he might have flown out from it.\nThe bird looked black against the light background, and the wings\nextended from one rim of the disc to the other. He flew on, evenly, in\nthe same direction, and the boy thought that he was painted on the\nmoon's disc. The body was small, the neck long and slender, the legs\nhung down, long and thin. It couldn't be anything but a stork.\n\nA couple of seconds later Herr Ermenrich, the stork, lit beside the boy.\nHe bent down and poked him with his bill to awaken him.\n\nInstantly the boy sat up. \"I'm not asleep, Herr Ermenrich,\" he said.\n\"How does it happen that you are out in the middle of the night, and how\nis everything at Glimminge castle? Do you want to speak with mother\nAkka?\"\n\n\"It's too light to sleep to-night,\" answered Herr Ermenrich. \"Therefore\nI concluded to travel over here to Karl's Island and hunt you up, friend\nThumbietot. I learned from the seamew that you were spending the night\nhere. I have not as yet moved over to Glimminge castle, but am still\nliving at Pommern.\"\n\nThe boy was simply overjoyed to think that Herr Ermenrich had sought him\nout. They chatted about all sorts of things, like old friends. At last\nthe stork asked the boy if he wouldn't like to go out riding for a while\non this beautiful night.\n\nOh, yes! that the boy wanted to do, if the stork would manage it so that\nhe got back to the wild geese before sunrise. This he promised, so off\nthey went.\n\nAgain Herr Ermenrich flew straight toward the moon. They rose and rose;\nthe sea sank deep down, but the flight went so light and easy that it\nseemed almost as if the boy lay still in the air.\n\nWhen Herr Ermenrich began to descend, the boy thought that the flight\nhad lasted an unreasonably short time.\n\nThey landed on a desolate bit of seashore, which was covered with fine,\neven sand. All along the coast ran a row of flying-sand drifts, with\nlyme-grass on their tops. They were not very high, but they prevented\nthe boy from seeing any of the island.\n\nHerr Ermenrich stood on a sand-hill, drew up one leg and bent his head\nbackward, so he could stick his bill under the wing. \"You can roam\naround on the shore for a while,\" he said to Thumbietot, \"while I rest\nmyself. But don't go so far away but what you can find your way back to\nme again!\"\n\nTo start with, the boy intended to climb a sand-hill and see how the\nland behind it looked. But when he had walked a couple of paces, he\nstubbed the toe of his wooden shoe against something hard. He stooped\ndown, and saw that a small copper coin lay on the sand, and was so worn\nwith verdigris that it was almost transparent. It was so poor that he\ndidn't even bother to pick it up, but only kicked it out of the way.\n\nBut when he straightened himself up once more he was perfectly\nastounded, for two paces away from him stood a high, dark wall with a\nbig, turreted gate.\n\nThe moment before, when the boy bent down, the sea lay there--shimmering\nand smooth, while now it was hidden by a long wall with towers and\nbattlements. Directly in front of him, where before there had been only\na few sea-weed banks, the big gate of the wall opened.\n\nThe boy probably understood that it was a spectre-play of some sort; but\nthis was nothing to be afraid of, thought he. It wasn't any dangerous\ntrolls, or any other evil--such as he always dreaded to encounter at\nnight. Both the wall and the gate were so beautifully constructed that\nhe only desired to see what there might be back of them. \"I must find\nout what this can be,\" thought he, and went in through the gate.\n\nIn the deep archway there were guards, dressed in brocaded and purred\nsuits, with long-handled spears beside them, who sat and threw dice.\nThey thought only of the game, and took no notice of the boy who hurried\npast them quickly.\n\nJust within the gate he found an open space, paved with large, even\nstone blocks. All around this were high and magnificent buildings; and\nbetween these opened long, narrow streets. On the square--facing the\ngate--it fairly swarmed with human beings. The men wore long,\nfur-trimmed capes over satin suits; plume-bedecked hats sat obliquely on\ntheir heads; on their chests hung superb chains. They were all so\nregally gotten up that the whole lot of them might have been kings.\n\nThe women went about in high head-dresses and long robes with\ntight-fitting sleeves. They, too, were beautifully dressed, but their\nsplendour was not to be compared with that of the men.\n\nThis was exactly like the old story-book which mother took from the\nchest--only once--and showed to him. The boy simply couldn't believe his\neyes.\n\nBut that which was even more wonderful to look upon than either the men\nor the women, was the city itself. Every house was built in such a way\nthat a gable faced the street. And the gables were so highly ornamented,\nthat one could believe they wished to compete with each other as to\nwhich one could show the most beautiful decorations.\n\nWhen one suddenly sees so much that is new, he cannot manage to treasure\nit all in his memory. But at least the boy could recall that he had seen\nstairway gables on the various landings, which bore images of the Christ\nand his Apostles; gables, where there were images in niche after niche\nall along the wall; gables that were inlaid with multi-coloured bits of\nglass, and gables that were striped and checked with white and black\nmarble. As the boy admired all this, a sudden sense of haste came over\nhim. \"Anything like this my eyes have never seen before. Anything like\nthis, they would never see again,\" he said to himself. And he began to\nrun in toward the city--up one street, and down another.\n\nThe streets were straight and narrow, but not empty and gloomy, as they\nwere in the cities with which he was familiar. There were people\neverywhere. Old women sat by their open doors and spun without a\nspinning-wheel--only with the help of a shuttle. The merchants' shops\nwere like market-stalls--opening on the street. All the hand-workers did\ntheir work out of doors. In one place they were boiling crude oil; in\nanother tanning hides; in a third there was a long rope-walk.\n\nIf only the boy had had time enough he could have learned how to make\nall sorts of things. Here he saw how armourers hammered out thin\nbreast-plates; how turners tended their irons; how the shoemakers soled\nsoft, red shoes; how the gold-wire drawers twisted gold thread, and how\nthe weavers inserted silver and gold into their weaving.\n\nBut the boy did not have the time to stay. He just rushed on, so that he\ncould manage to see as much as possible before it would all vanish\nagain.\n\nThe high wall ran all around the city and shut it in, as a hedge shuts\nin a field. He saw it at the end of every street--gable-ornamented and\ncrenelated. On the top of the wall walked warriors in shining armour;\nand when he had run from one end of the city to the other, he came to\nstill another gate in the wall. Outside of this lay the sea and\nharbour. The boy saw olden-time ships, with rowing-benches straight\nacross, and high structures fore and aft. Some lay and took on cargo,\nothers were just casting anchor. Carriers and merchants hurried around\neach other. All over, it was life and bustle.\n\nBut not even here did he seem to have the time to linger. He rushed into\nthe city again; and now he came up to the big square. There stood the\ncathedral with its three high towers and deep vaulted arches filled with\nimages. The walls had been so highly decorated by sculptors that there\nwas not a stone without its own special ornamentation. And what a\nmagnificent display of gilded crosses and gold-trimmed altars and\npriests in golden vestments, shimmered through the open gate! Directly\nopposite the church there was a house with a notched roof and a single\nslender, sky-high tower. That was probably the courthouse. And between\nthe courthouse and the cathedral, all around the square, stood the\nbeautiful gabled houses with their multiplicity of adornments.\n\nThe boy had run himself both warm and tired. He thought that now he had\nseen the most remarkable things, and therefore he began to walk more\nleisurely. The street which he had turned into now was surely the one\nwhere the inhabitants purchased their fine clothing. He saw crowds of\npeople standing before the little stalls where the merchants spread\nbrocades, stiff satins, heavy gold cloth, shimmery velvet, delicate\nveiling, and laces as sheer as a spider's web.\n\nBefore, when the boy ran so fast, no one had paid any attention to him.\nThe people must have thought that it was only a little gray rat that\ndarted by them. But now, when he walked down the street, very slowly,\none of the salesmen caught sight of him, and began to beckon to him.\n\nAt first the boy was uneasy and wanted to hurry out of the way, but the\nsalesman only beckoned and smiled, and spread out on the counter a\nlovely piece of satin damask as if he wanted to tempt him.\n\nThe boy shook his head. \"I will never be so rich that I can buy even a\nmetre of that cloth,\" thought he.\n\nBut now they had caught sight of him in every stall, all along the\nstreet. Wherever he looked stood a salesman and beckoned to him. They\nleft their costly wares, and thought only of him. He saw how they\nhurried into the most hidden corner of the stall to fetch the best that\nthey had to sell, and how their hands trembled with eagerness and haste\nas they laid it upon the counter.\n\nWhen the boy continued to go on, one of the merchants jumped over the\ncounter, caught hold of him, and spread before him silver cloth and\nwoven tapestries, which shone with brilliant colours.\n\nThe boy couldn't do anything but laugh at him. The salesman certainly\nmust understand that a poor little creature like him couldn't buy such\nthings. He stood still and held out his two empty hands, so they would\nunderstand that he had nothing and let him go in peace.\n\nBut the merchant raised a finger and nodded and pushed the whole pile of\nbeautiful things over to him.\n\n\"Can he mean that he will sell all this for a gold piece?\" wondered the\nboy.\n\nThe merchant brought out a tiny worn and poor coin--the smallest that\none could see--and showed it to him. And he was so eager to sell that\nhe increased his pile with a pair of large, heavy, silver goblets.\n\nThen the boy began to dig down in his pockets. He knew, of course, that\nhe didn't possess a single coin, but he couldn't help feeling for it.\n\nAll the other merchants stood still and tried to see how the sale would\ncome off, and when they observed that the boy began to search in his\npockets, they flung themselves over the counters, filled their hands\nfull of gold and silver ornaments, and offered them to him. And they all\nshowed him that what they asked in payment was just one little penny.\n\nBut the boy turned both vest and breeches pockets inside out, so they\nshould see that he owned nothing. Then tears filled the eyes of all\nthese regal merchants, who were so much richer than he. At last he was\nmoved because they looked so distressed, and he pondered if he could not\nin some way help them. And then he happened to think of the rusty coin,\nwhich he had but lately seen on the strand.\n\nHe started to run down the street, and luck was with him so that he came\nto the self-same gate which he had happened upon first. He dashed\nthrough it, and commenced to search for the little green copper penny\nwhich lay on the strand a while ago.\n\nHe found it too, very promptly; but when he had picked it up, and wanted\nto run back to the city with it--he saw only the sea before him. No city\nwall, no gate, no sentinels, no streets, no houses could now be\nseen--only the sea.\n\nThe boy couldn't help that the tears came to his eyes. He had believed\nin the beginning, that that which he saw was nothing but an\nhallucination, but this he had already forgotten. He only thought about\nhow pretty everything was. He felt a genuine, deep sorrow because the\ncity had vanished.\n\nThat moment Herr Ermenrich awoke, and came up to him. But he didn't hear\nhim, and the stork had to poke the boy with his bill to attract\nattention to himself. \"I believe that you stand here and sleep just as I\ndo,\" said Herr Ermenrich.\n\n\"Oh, Herr Ermenrich!\" said the boy. \"What was that city which stood\nhere just now?\"\n\n\"Have you seen a city?\" said the stork. \"You have slept and dreamt, as I\nsay.\"\n\n\"No! I have not dreamt,\" said Thumbietot, and he told the stork all that\nhe had experienced.\n\nThen Herr Ermenrich said: \"For my part, Thumbietot, I believe that you\nfell asleep here on the strand and dreamed all this.\n\n\"But I will not conceal from you that Bataki, the raven, who is the most\nlearned of all birds, once told me that in former times there was a city\non this shore, called Vineta. It was so rich and so fortunate, that no\ncity has ever been more glorious; but its inhabitants, unluckily, gave\nthemselves up to arrogance and love of display. As a punishment for\nthis, says Bataki, the city of Vineta was overtaken by a flood, and sank\ninto the sea. But its inhabitants cannot die, neither is their city\ndestroyed. And one night in every hundred years, it rises in all its\nsplendour up from the sea, and remains on the surface just one hour.\"\n\n\"Yes, it must be so,\" said Thumbietot, \"for this I have seen.\"\n\n\"But when the hour is up, it sinks again into the sea, if, during that\ntime, no merchant in Vineta has sold anything to a single living\ncreature. If you, Thumbietot, only had had an ever so tiny coin, to pay\nthe merchants, Vineta might have remained up here on the shore; and its\npeople could have lived and died like other human beings.\"\n\n\"Herr Ermenrich,\" said the boy, \"now I understand why you came and\nfetched me in the middle of the night. It was because you believed that\nI should be able to save the old city. I am so sorry it didn't turn out\nas you wished, Herr Ermenrich.\"\n\nHe covered his face with his hands and wept. It wasn't easy to say which\none looked the more disconsolate--the boy, or Herr Ermenrich.\n\nTHE LIVING CITY\n\n_Monday, April eleventh_.\n\nOn the afternoon of Easter Monday, the wild geese and Thumbietot were on\nthe wing. They travelled over Gottland.\n\nThe large island lay smooth and even beneath them. The ground was\nchecked just as it was in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne and there were many churches and farms.\nBut there was this difference, however, that there were more leafy\nmeadows between the fields here, and then the farms were not built up\nwith small houses. And there were no large manors with ancient\ntower-ornamented castles.\n\nThe wild geese had taken the route over Gottland on account of\nThumbietot. He had been altogether unlike himself for two days, and\nhadn't spoken a cheerful word. This was because he had thought of\nnothing but that city which had appeared to him in such a strange way.\nHe had never seen anything so magnificent and royal, and he could not be\nreconciled with himself for having failed to save it. Usually he was not\nchicken-hearted, but now he actually grieved for the beautiful buildings\nand the stately people.\n\nBoth Akka and the goosey-gander tried to convince Thumbietot that he had\nbeen the victim of a dream, or an hallucination, but the boy wouldn't\nlisten to anything of that sort. He was so positive that he had really\nseen what he had seen, that no one could move him from this conviction.\nHe went about so disconsolate that his travelling companions became\nuneasy for him.\n\nJust as the boy was the most depressed, old Kaksi came back to the\nflock. She had been blown toward Gottland, and had been compelled to\ntravel over the whole island before she had learned through some crows\nthat her comrades were on Little Karl's Island. When Kaksi found out\nwhat was wrong with Thumbietot, she said impulsively:\n\n\"If Thumbietot is grieving over an old city, we'll soon be able to\ncomfort him. Just come along, and I'll take you to a place that I saw\nyesterday! You will not need to be distressed very long.\"\n\nThereupon the geese had taken farewell of the sheep, and were on their\nway to the place which Kaksi wished to show Thumbietot. As blue as he\nwas, he couldn't keep from looking at the land over which he travelled,\nas usual.\n\nHe thought it looked as though the whole island had in the beginning\nbeen just such a high, steep cliff as Karl's Island--though much bigger\nof course. But afterward, it had in some way been flattened out. Someone\nhad taken a big rolling-pin and rolled over it, as if it had been a lump\nof dough. Not that the island had become altogether flat and even, like\na bread-cake, for it wasn't like that. While they had travelled along\nthe coast, he had seen white lime walls with grottoes and crags, in\nseveral directions; but in most of the places they were levelled, and\nsank inconspicuously down toward the sea.\n\nIn Gottland they had a pleasant and peaceful holiday afternoon. It\nturned out to be mild spring weather; the trees had large buds; spring\nblossoms dressed the ground in the leafy meadows; the poplars' long,\nthin pendants swayed; and in the little gardens, which one finds around\nevery cottage, the gooseberry bushes were green.\n\nThe warmth and the spring-budding had tempted the people out into the\ngardens and roads, and wherever a number of them were gathered together\nthey were playing. It was not the children alone who played, but the\ngrown-ups also. They were throwing stones at a given point, and they\nthrew balls in the air with such exact aim that they almost touched the\nwild geese. It looked cheerful and pleasant to see big folks at play;\nand the boy certainly would have enjoyed it, if he had been able to\nforget his grief because he had failed to save the city.\n\nAnyway, he had to admit that this was a lovely trip. There was so much\nsinging and sound in the air. Little children played ring games, and\nsang as they played. The Salvation Army was out. He saw a lot of people\ndressed in black and red--sitting upon a wooded hill, playing on guitars\nand brass instruments. On one road came a great crowd of people. They\nwere Good Templars who had been on a pleasure trip. He recognized them\nby the big banners with the gold inscriptions which waved above them.\nThey sang song after song as long as he could hear them.\n\nAfter that the boy could never think of Gottland without thinking of the\ngames and songs at the same time.\n\nHe had been sitting and looking down for a long while; but now he\nhappened to raise his eyes. No one can describe his amazement. Before he\nwas aware of it, the wild geese had left the interior of the island and\ngone westward--toward the sea-coast. Now the wide, blue sea lay before\nhim. However, it was not the sea that was remarkable, but a city which\nappeared on the sea-shore.\n\nThe boy came from the east, and the sun had just begun to go down in the\nwest. When he came nearer the city, its walls and towers and high,\ngabled houses and churches stood there, perfectly black, against the\nlight evening sky. He couldn't see therefore what it really looked like,\nand for a couple of moments he believed that this city was just as\nbeautiful as the one he had seen on Easter night.\n\nWhen he got right up to it, he saw that it was both like and unlike that\ncity from the bottom of the sea. There was the same contrast between\nthem, as there is between a man whom one sees arrayed in purple and\njewels one day, and on another day one sees him dressed in rags.\n\nYes, this city had probably, once upon a time, been like the one which\nhe sat and thought about. This one, also, was enclosed by a wall with\ntowers and gates. But the towers in this city, which had been allowed to\nremain on land, were roofless, hollow and empty. The gates were without\ndoors; sentinels and warriors had disappeared. All the glittering\nsplendour was gone. There was nothing left but the naked, gray stone\nskeleton.\n\nWhen the boy came farther into the city, he saw that the larger part of\nit was made up of small, low houses; but here and there were still a few\nhigh gabled houses and a few cathedrals, which were from the olden time.\nThe walls of the gabled houses were whitewashed, and entirely without\nornamentation; but because the boy had so lately seen the buried city,\nhe seemed to understand how they had been decorated: some with statues,\nand others with black and white marble. And it was the same with the old\ncathedrals; the majority of them were roofless with bare interiors. The\nwindow openings were empty, the floors were grass-grown, and ivy\nclambered along the walls. But now he knew how they had looked at one\ntime; that they had been covered with images and paintings; that the\nchancel had had trimmed altars and gilded crosses, and that their\npriests had moved about, arrayed in gold vestments.\n\nThe boy saw also the narrow streets, which were almost deserted on\nholiday afternoons. He knew, he did, what a stream of stately people had\nonce upon a time sauntered about on them. He knew that they had been\nlike large workshops--filled with all sorts of workmen.\n\nBut that which Nils Holgersson did not see was, that the city--even\nto-day--was both beautiful and remarkable. He saw neither the cheery\ncottages on the side streets, with their black walls, and white bows and\nred pelargoniums behind the shining window-panes, nor the many pretty\ngardens and avenues, nor the beauty in the weed-clad ruins. His eyes\nwere so filled with the preceding glory, that he could not see anything\ngood in the present.\n\nThe wild geese flew back and forth over the city a couple of times, so\nthat Thumbietot might see everything. Finally they sank down on the\ngrass-grown floor of a cathedral ruin to spend the night.\n\nWhen they had arranged themselves for sleep, Thumbietot was still awake\nand looked up through the open arches, to the pale pink evening sky.\nWhen he had been sitting there a while, he thought he didn't want to\ngrieve any more because he couldn't save the buried city.\n\nNo, that he didn't want to do, now that he had seen this one. If that\ncity, which he had seen, had not sunk into the sea again, then it would\nperhaps become as dilapidated as this one in a little while. Perhaps it\ncould not have withstood time and decay, but would have stood there with\nroofless churches and bare houses and desolate, empty streets--just like\nthis one. Then it was better that it should remain in all its glory down\nin the deep.\n\n\"It was best that it happened as it happened,\" thought he. \"If I had the\npower to save the city, I don't believe that I should care to do it.\"\nThen he no longer grieved over that matter.\n\nAnd there are probably many among the young who think in the same way.\nBut when people are old, and have become accustomed to being satisfied\nwith little, then they are more happy over the Visby that exists, than\nover a magnificent Vineta at the bottom of the sea.\n\n\nTHE LEGEND OF SM\u00c3\u0085LAND\n\n\n_Tuesday, April twelfth_.\n\nThe wild geese had made a good trip over the sea, and had lighted in\nTjust Township, in northern Sm\u00c3\u00a5land. That township didn't seem able to\nmake up its mind whether it wanted to be land or sea. Fiords ran in\neverywhere, and cut the land up into islands and peninsulas and points\nand capes. The sea was so forceful that the only things which could hold\nthemselves above it were hills and mountains. All the lowlands were\nhidden away under the water exterior.\n\nIt was evening when the wild geese came in from the sea; and the land\nwith the little hills lay prettily between the shimmering fiords. Here\nand there, on the islands, the boy saw cabins and cottages; and the\nfarther inland he came, the bigger and better became the dwelling\nhouses. Finally, they grew into large, white manors. Along the shores\nthere was generally a border of trees; and within this lay field-plots,\nand on the tops of the little hills there were trees again. He could not\nhelp but think of Blekinge. Here again was a place where land and sea\nmet, in such a pretty and peaceful sort of way, just as if they tried to\nshow each other the best and loveliest which they possessed.\n\nThe wild geese alighted upon a limestone island a good way in on\nGoose-fiord. With the first glance at the shore they observed that\nspring had made rapid strides while they had been away on the islands.\nThe big, fine trees were not as yet leaf-clad, but the ground under them\nwas brocaded with white anemones, gagea, and blue anemones.\n\nWhen the wild geese saw the flower-carpet they feared that they had\nlingered too long in the southern part of the country. Akka said\ninstantly that there was no time in which to hunt up any of the stopping\nplaces in Sm\u00c3\u00a5land. By the next morning they must travel northward, over\n\u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland.\n\nThe boy should then see nothing of Sm\u00c3\u00a5land, and this grieved him. He had\nheard more about Sm\u00c3\u00a5land than he had about any other province, and he\nhad longed to see it with his own eyes.\n\nThe summer before, when he had served as goose-boy with a farmer in the\nneighbourhood of Jordberga, he had met a pair of Sm\u00c3\u00a5land children,\nalmost every day, who also tended geese. These children had irritated\nhim terribly with their Sm\u00c3\u00a5land.\n\nIt wasn't fair to say that Osa, the goose-girl, had annoyed him. She was\nmuch too wise for that. But the one who could be aggravating with a\nvengeance was her brother, little Mats.\n\n\"Have you heard, Nils Goose-boy, how it went when Sm\u00c3\u00a5land and Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne were\ncreated?\" he would ask, and if Nils Holgersson said no, he began\nimmediately to relate the old joke-legend.\n\n\"Well, it was at that time when our Lord was creating the world. While\nhe was doing his best work, Saint Peter came walking by. He stopped and\nlooked on, and then he asked if it was hard to do. 'Well, it isn't\nexactly easy,' said our Lord. Saint Peter stood there a little longer,\nand when he noticed how easy it was to lay out one landscape after\nanother, he too wanted to try his hand at it. 'Perhaps you need to rest\nyourself a little,' said Saint Peter, 'I could attend to the work in\nthe meantime for you.' But this our Lord did not wish. 'I do not know if\nyou are so much at home in this art that I can trust you to take hold\nwhere I leave off,' he answered. Then Saint Peter was angry, and said\nthat he believed he could create just as fine countries as our Lord\nhimself.\n\n\"It happened that our Lord was just then creating Sm\u00c3\u00a5land. It wasn't\neven half-ready but it looked as though it would be an indescribably\npretty and fertile land. It was difficult for our Lord to say no to\nSaint Peter, and aside from this, he thought very likely that a thing so\nwell begun no one could spoil. Therefore he said: If you like, we will\nprove which one of us two understands this sort of work the better. You,\nwho are only a novice, shall go on with this which I have begun, and I\nwill create a new land.' To this Saint Peter agreed at once; and so they\nwent to work--each one in his place.\n\n\"Our Lord moved southward a bit, and there he undertook to create Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne.\nIt wasn't long before he was through with it, and soon he asked if Saint\nPeter had finished, and would come and look at his work. 'I had mine\nready long ago,' said Saint Peter; and from the sound of his voice it\ncould be heard how pleased he was with what he had accomplished.\n\n\"When Saint Peter saw Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, he had to acknowledge that there was\nnothing but good to be said of that land. It was a fertile land and easy\nto cultivate, with wide plains wherever one looked, and hardly a sign of\nhills. It was evident that our Lord had really contemplated making it\nsuch that people should feel at home there. 'Yes, this is a good\ncountry,' said Saint Peter, 'but I think that mine is better.' 'Then\nwe'll take a look at it,' said our Lord.\n\n\"The land was already finished in the north and east when Saint Peter\nbegan the work, but the southern and western parts; and the whole\ninterior, he had created all by himself. Now when our Lord came up\nthere, where Saint Peter had been at work, he was so horrified that he\nstopped short and exclaimed: 'What on earth have you been doing with\nthis land, Saint Peter?'\n\n\"Saint Peter, too, stood and looked around--perfectly astonished. He\nhad had the idea that nothing could be so good for a land as a great\ndeal of warmth. Therefore he had gathered together an enormous mass of\nstones and mountains, and erected a highland, and this he had done so\nthat it should be near the sun, and receive much help from the sun's\nheat. Over the stone-heaps he had spread a thin layer of soil, and then\nhe had thought that everything was well arranged.\n\n\"But while he was down in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, a couple of heavy showers had come up,\nand more was not needed to show what his work amounted to. When our\nLord came to inspect the land, all the soil had been washed away, and\nthe naked mountain foundation shone forth all over. Where it was about\nthe best, lay clay and heavy gravel over the rocks, but it looked so\npoor that it was easy to understand that hardly anything except spruce\nand juniper and moss and heather could grow there. But what there was\nplenty of was water. It had filled up all the clefts in the mountain;\nand lakes and rivers and brooks; these one saw everywhere, to say\nnothing of swamps and morasses, which spread over large tracts. And the\nmost exasperating thing of all was, that while some tracts had too much\nwater, it was so scarce in others, that whole fields lay like dry moors,\nwhere sand and earth whirled up in clouds with the least little breeze.\n\n\"'What can have been your meaning in creating such a land as this?' said\nour Lord. Saint Peter made excuses, and declared he had wished to build\nup a land so high that it should have plenty of warmth from the sun.\n'But then you will also get much of the night chill,' said our Lord,\n'for that too comes from heaven. I am very much afraid the little that\ncan grow here will freeze.'\n\n\"This, to be sure, Saint Peter hadn't thought about.\n\n\"'Yes, here it will be a poor and frost-bound land,' said our Lord, 'it\ncan't be helped.'\"\n\nWhen little Mats had gotten this far in his story, Osa, the goose-girl,\nprotested: \"I cannot bear, little Mats, to hear you say that it is so\nmiserable in Sm\u00c3\u00a5land,\" said she. \"You forget entirely how much good soil\nthere is there. Only think of M\u00c3\u00b6re district, by Kalmar Sound! I wonder\nwhere you'll find a richer grain region. There are fields upon fields,\njust like here in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. The soil is so good that I cannot imagine\nanything that couldn't grow there.\"\n\n\"I can't help that,\" said little Mats. \"I'm only relating what others\nhave said before.\"\n\n\"And I have heard many say that there is not a more beautiful coast land\nthan Tjust. Think of the bays and islets, and the manors, and the\ngroves!\" said Osa. \"Yes, that's true enough,\" little Mats admitted. \"And\ndon't you remember,\" continued Osa, \"the school teacher said that such\na lively and picturesque district as that bit of Sm\u00c3\u00a5land which lies\nsouth of Lake Vettern is not to be found in all Sweden? Think of the\nbeautiful sea and the yellow coast-mountains, and of Grenna and\nJ\u00c3\u00b6nk\u00c3\u00b6ping, with its match factory, and think of Huskvarna, and all the\nbig establishments there!\" \"Yes, that's true enough,\" said little Mats\nonce again. \"And think of Visings\u00c3\u00b6, little Mats, with the ruins and the\noak forests and the legends! Think of the valley through which Em\u00c3\u00a5n\nflows, with all the villages and flour-mills and sawmills, and the\ncarpenter shops!\" \"Yes, that is true enough,\" said little Mats, and\nlooked troubled.\n\nAll of a sudden he had looked up. \"Now we are pretty stupid,\" said he.\n\"All this, of course, lies in our Lord's Sm\u00c3\u00a5land, in that part of the\nland which was already finished when Saint Peter undertook the job. It's\nonly natural that it should be pretty and fine there. But in Saint\nPeter's Sm\u00c3\u00a5land it looks as it says in the legend. And it wasn't\nsurprising that our Lord was distressed when he saw it,\" continued\nlittle Mats, as he took up the thread of his story again. \"Saint Peter\ndidn't lose his courage, at all events, but tried to comfort our Lord.\n'Don't be so grieved over this!' said he. 'Only wait until I have\ncreated people who can till the swamps and break up fields from the\nstone hills.'\n\n\"That was the end of our Lord's patience--and he said: 'No! you can go\ndown to Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne and make the Sk\u00c3\u00a5ninge, but the Sm\u00c3\u00a5lander I will create\nmyself.' And so our Lord created the Sm\u00c3\u00a5lander, and made him\nquick-witted and contented and happy and thrifty and enterprising and\ncapable, that he might be able to get his livelihood in his poor\ncountry.\"\n\nThen little Mats was silent; and if Nils Holgersson had also kept still,\nall would have gone well; but he couldn't possibly refrain from asking\nhow Saint Peter had succeeded in creating the Sk\u00c3\u00a5ninge.\n\n\"Well, what do you think yourself?\" said little Mats, and looked so\nscornful that Nils Holgersson threw himself upon him, to thrash him. But\nMats was only a little tot, and Osa, the goose-girl, who was a year\nolder than he, ran forward instantly to help him. Good-natured though\nshe was, she sprang like a lion as soon as anyone touched her brother.\nAnd Nils Holgersson did not care to fight a girl, but turned his back,\nand didn't look at those Sm\u00c3\u00a5land children for the rest of the day.\n\n\nTHE CROWS\n\n\nTHE EARTHEN CROCK\n\nIn the southwest corner of Sm\u00c3\u00a5land lies a township called Sonnerbo. It\nis a rather smooth and even country. And one who sees it in winter, when\nit is covered with snow, cannot imagine that there is anything under the\nsnow but garden-plots, rye-fields and clover-meadows as is generally the\ncase in flat countries. But, in the beginning of April when the snow\nfinally melts away in Sonnerbo, it is apparent that that which lies\nhidden under it is only dry, sandy heaths, bare rocks, and big, marshy\nswamps. There are fields here and there, to be sure, but they are so\nsmall that they are scarcely worth mentioning; and one also finds a few\nlittle red or gray farmhouses hidden away in some beech-coppice--almost\nas if they were afraid to show themselves.\n\nWhere Sonnerbo township touches the boundaries of Halland, there is a\nsandy heath which is so far-reaching that he who stands upon one edge of\nit cannot look across to the other. Nothing except heather grows on the\nheath, and it wouldn't be easy either to coax other growths to thrive\nthere. To start with one would have to uproot the heather; for it is\nthus with heather: although it has only a little shrunken root, small\nshrunken branches, and dry, shrunken leaves it fancies that it's a tree.\nTherefore it acts just like real trees--spreads itself out in forest\nfashion over wide areas; holds together faithfully, and causes all\nforeign growths that wish to crowd in upon its territory to die out.\n\nThe only place on the heath where the heather is not all-powerful, is a\nlow, stony ridge which passes over it. There you'll find juniper bushes,\nmountain ash, and a few large, fine oaks. At the time when Nils\nHolgersson travelled around with the wild geese, a little cabin stood\nthere, with a bit of cleared ground around it. But the people who had\nlived there at one time, had, for some reason or other, moved away. The\nlittle cabin was empty, and the ground lay unused.\n\nWhen the tenants left the cabin they closed the damper, fastened the\nwindow-hooks, and locked the door. But no one had thought of the broken\nwindow-pane which was only stuffed with a rag. After the showers of a\ncouple of summers, the rag had moulded and shrunk, and, finally, a crow\nhad succeeded in poking it out.\n\nThe ridge on the heather-heath was really not as desolate as one might\nthink, for it was inhabited by a large crow-folk. Naturally, the crows\ndid not live there all the year round. They moved to foreign lands in\nthe winter; in the autumn they travelled from one grain-field to another\nall over G\u00c3\u00b6taland, and picked grain; during the summer, they spread\nthemselves over the farms in Sonnerbo township, and lived upon eggs and\nberries and birdlings; but every spring, when nesting time came, they\ncame back to the heather-heath.\n\nThe one who had poked the rag from the window was a crow-cock named Garm\nWhitefeather; but he was never called anything but Fumle or Drumle, or\nout and out Fumle-Drumle, because he always acted awkwardly and\nstupidly, and wasn't good for anything except to make fun of.\nFumle-Drumle was bigger and stronger than any of the other crows, but\nthat didn't help him in the least; he was--and remained--a butt for\nridicule. And it didn't profit him, either, that he came from very good\nstock. If everything had gone smoothly, he should have been leader for\nthe whole flock, because this honour had, from time immemorial, belonged\nto the oldest Whitefeather. But long before Fumle-Drumle was born, the\npower had gone from his family, and was now wielded by a cruel wild\ncrow, named Wind-Rush.\n\nThis transference of power was due to the fact that the crows on\ncrow-ridge desired to change their manner of living. Possibly there are\nmany who think that everything in the shape of crow lives in the same\nway; but this is not so. There are entire crow-folk who lead honourable\nlives--that is to say, they only eat grain, worms, caterpillars, and\ndead animals; and there are others who lead a regular bandit's life, who\nthrow themselves upon baby-hares and small birds, and plunder every\nsingle bird's nest they set eyes on.\n\nThe ancient Whitefeathers had been strict and temperate; and as long as\nthey had led the flock, the crows had been compelled to conduct\nthemselves in such a way that other birds could speak no ill of them.\nBut the crows were numerous, and poverty was great among them. They\ndidn't care to go the whole length of living a strictly moral life, so\nthey rebelled against the Whitefeathers, and gave the power to\nWind-Rush, who was the worst nest-plunderer and robber that could be\nimagined--if his wife, Wind-Air, wasn't worse still. Under their\ngovernment the crows had begun to lead such a life that now they were\nmore feared than pigeon-hawks and leech-owls.\n\nNaturally, Fumle-Drumle had nothing to say in the flock. The crows were\nall of the opinion that he did not in the least take after his\nforefathers, and that he wouldn't suit as a leader. No one would have\nmentioned him, if he hadn't constantly committed fresh blunders. A few,\nwho were quite sensible, sometimes said perhaps it was lucky for\nFumle-Drumle that he was such a bungling idiot, otherwise Wind-Rush and\nWind-Air would hardly have allowed him--who was of the old chieftain\nstock--to remain with the flock.\n\nNow, on the other hand, they were rather friendly toward him, and\nwillingly took him along with them on their hunting expeditions. There\nall could observe how much more skilful and daring they were than he.\n\nNone of the crows knew that it was Fumle-Drumle who had pecked the rag\nout of the window; and had they known of this, they would have been very\nmuch astonished. Such a thing as daring to approach a human being's\ndwelling, they had never believed of him. He kept the thing to himself\nvery carefully; and he had his own good reasons for it. Wind-Rush always\ntreated him well in the daytime, and when the others were around; but\none very dark night, when the comrades sat on the night branch, he was\nattacked by a couple of crows and nearly murdered. After that he moved\nevery night, after dark, from his usual sleeping quarters into the empty\ncabin.\n\nNow one afternoon, when the crows had put their nests in order on\ncrow-ridge, they happened upon a remarkable find. Wind-Rush,\nFumle-Drumle, and a couple of others had flown down into a big hollow in\none corner of the heath. The hollow was nothing but a gravel-pit, but\nthe crows could not be satisfied with such a simple explanation; they\nflew down in it continually, and turned every single sand-grain to get\nat the reason why human beings had digged it. While the crows were\npottering around down there, a mass of gravel fell from one side. They\nrushed up to it, and had the good fortune to find amongst the fallen\nstones and stubble--a large earthen crock, which was locked with a\nwooden clasp! Naturally they wanted to know if there was anything in it,\nand they tried both to peck holes in the crock, and to bend up the\nclasp, but they had no success.\n\nThey stood perfectly helpless and examined the crock, when they heard\nsomeone say: \"Shall I come down and assist you crows?\" They glanced up\nquickly. On the edge of the hollow sat a fox and blinked down at them.\nHe was one of the prettiest foxes--both in colour and form--that they\nhad ever seen. The only fault with him was that he had lost an ear.\n\n\"If you desire to do us a service,\" said Wind-Rush, \"we shall not say\nnay.\" At the same time, both he and the others flew up from the hollow.\nThen the fox jumped down in their place, bit at the jar, and pulled at\nthe lock--but he couldn't open it either.\n\n\"Can you make out what there is in it?\" said Wind-Rush. The fox rolled\nthe jar back and forth, and listened attentively. \"It must be silver\nmoney,\" said he.\n\nThis was more than the crows had expected. \"Do you think it can be\nsilver?\" said they, and their eyes were ready to pop out of their heads\nwith greed; for remarkable as it may sound, there is nothing in the\nworld which crows love as much as silver money.\n\n\"Hear how it rattles!\" said the fox and rolled the crock around once\nmore. \"Only I can't understand how we shall get at it.\" \"That will\nsurely be impossible,\" said the crows. The fox stood and rubbed his head\nagainst his left leg, and pondered. Now perhaps he might succeed, with\nthe help of the crows, in becoming master of that little imp who always\neluded him. \"Oh! I know someone who could open the crock for you,\" said\nthe fox. \"Then tell us! Tell us!\" cried the crows; and they were so\nexcited that they tumbled down into the pit. \"That I will do, if you'll\nfirst promise me that you will agree to my terms,\" said he.\n\nThen the fox told the crows about Thumbietot, and said that if they\ncould bring him to the heath he would open the crock for them. But in\npayment for this counsel, he demanded that they should deliver\nThumbietot to him, as soon as he had gotten the silver money for them.\nThe crows had no reason to spare Thumbietot, so agreed to the compact at\nonce. It was easy enough to agree to this; but it was harder to find out\nwhere Thumbietot and the wild geese were stopping.\n\nWind-Rush himself travelled away with fifty crows, and said that he\nshould soon return. But one day after another passed without the crows\non crow-ridge seeing a shadow of him.\n\nKIDNAPPED BY CROWS\n\n_Wednesday, April thirteenth_.\n\nThe wild geese were up at daybreak, so they should have time to get\nthemselves a bite of food before starting out on the journey toward\n\u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland. The island in Goosefiord, where they had slept, was small\nand barren, but in the water all around it were growths which they could\neat their fill upon. It was worse for the boy, however. He couldn't\nmanage to find anything eatable.\n\nAs he stood there hungry and drowsy, and looked around in all\ndirections, his glance fell upon a pair of squirrels, who played upon\nthe wooded point, directly opposite the rock island. He wondered if the\nsquirrels still had any of their winter supplies left, and asked the\nwhite goosey-gander to take him over to the point, that he might beg\nthem for a couple of hazelnuts.\n\nInstantly the white one swam across the sound with him; but as luck\nwould have it the squirrels had so much fun chasing each other from tree\nto tree, that they didn't bother about listening to the boy. They drew\nfarther into the grove. He hurried after them, and was soon out of the\ngoosey-gander's sight--who stayed behind and waited on the shore.\n\nThe boy waded forward between some white anemone-stems--which were so\nhigh they reached to his chin--when he felt that someone caught hold of\nhim from behind, and tried to lift him up. He turned round and saw that\na crow had grabbed him by the shirt-band. He tried to break loose, but\nbefore this was possible, another crow ran up, gripped him by the\nstocking, and knocked him over.\n\nIf Nils Holgersson had immediately cried for help, the white\ngoosey-gander certainly would have been able to save him; but the boy\nprobably thought that he could protect himself, unaided, against a\ncouple of crows. He kicked and struck out, but the crows didn't let go\ntheir hold, and they soon succeeded in raising themselves into the air\nwith him. To make matters worse, they flew so recklessly that his head\nstruck against a branch. He received a hard knock over the head, it grew\nblack before his eyes, and he lost consciousness.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes once more, he found himself high above the\nground. He regained his senses slowly; at first he knew neither where he\nwas, nor what he saw. When he glanced down, he saw that under him was\nspread a tremendously big woolly carpet, which was woven in greens and\nreds, and in large irregular patterns. The carpet was very thick and\nfine, but he thought it was a pity that it had been so badly used. It\nwas actually ragged; long tears ran through it; in some places large\npieces were torn away. And the strangest of all was that it appeared to\nbe spread over a mirror floor; for under the holes and tears in the\ncarpet shone bright and glittering glass.\n\nThe next thing the boy observed was that the sun unrolled itself in the\nheavens. Instantly, the mirror-glass under the holes and tears in the\ncarpet began to shimmer in red and gold. It looked very gorgeous, and\nthe boy was delighted with the pretty colour-scheme, although he didn't\nexactly understand what it was that he saw. But now the crows descended,\nand he saw at once that the big carpet under him was the earth, which\nwas dressed in green and brown cone-trees and naked leaf-trees, and that\nthe holes and tears were shining fiords and little lakes.\n\nHe remembered that the first time he had travelled up in the air, he\nhad thought that the earth in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne looked like a piece of checked\ncloth. But this country which resembled a torn carpet--what might this\nbe?\n\nHe began to ask himself a lot of questions. Why wasn't he sitting on the\ngoosey-gander's back? Why did a great swarm of crows fly around him? And\nwhy was he being pulled and knocked hither and thither so that he was\nabout to break to pieces?\n\nThen, all at once, the whole thing dawned on him. He had been kidnapped\nby a couple of crows. The white goosey-gander was still on the shore,\nwaiting, and to-day the wild geese were going to travel to \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland.\nHe was being carried southwest; this he understood because the sun's\ndisc was behind him. The big forest-carpet which lay beneath him was\nsurely Sm\u00c3\u00a5land.\n\n\"What will become of the goosey-gander now, when I cannot look after\nhim?\" thought the boy, and began to call to the crows to take him back\nto the wild geese instantly. He wasn't at all uneasy on his own account.\nHe believed that they were carrying him off simply in a spirit of\nmischief.\n\nThe crows didn't pay the slightest attention to his exhortations, but\nflew on as fast as they could. After a bit, one of them flapped his\nwings in a manner which meant: \"Look out! Danger!\" Soon thereafter they\ncame down in a spruce forest, pushed their way between prickly branches\nto the ground, and put the boy down under a thick spruce, where he was\nso well concealed that not even a falcon could have sighted him.\n\nFifty crows surrounded him, with bills pointed toward him to guard him.\n\"Now perhaps I may hear, crows, what your purpose is in carrying me\noff\", said he. But he was hardly permitted to finish the sentence before\na big crow hissed at him: \"Keep still! or I'll bore your eyes out.\"\n\nIt was evident that the crow meant what she said; and there was nothing\nfor the boy to do but obey. So he sat there and stared at the crows, and\nthe crows stared at him.\n\nThe longer he looked at them, the less he liked them. It was dreadful\nhow dusty and unkempt their feather dresses were--as though they knew\nneither baths nor oiling. Their toes and claws were grimy with dried-in\nmud, and the corners of their mouths were covered with food drippings.\nThese were very different birds from the wild geese--that he observed.\nHe thought they had a cruel, sneaky, watchful and bold appearance, just\nlike cut-throats and vagabonds.\n\n\"It is certainly a real robber-band that I've fallen in with,\" thought\nhe.\n\nJust then he heard the wild geese's call above him. \"Where are you? Here\nam I. Where are you? Here am I.\"\n\nHe understood that Akka and the others had gone out to search for him;\nbut before he could answer them the big crow who appeared to be the\nleader of the band hissed in his ear: \"Think of your eyes!\" And there\nwas nothing else for him to do but to keep still.\n\nThe wild geese may not have known that he was so near them, but had just\nhappened, incidentally, to travel over this forest. He heard their call\na couple of times more, then it died away. \"Well, now you'll have to get\nalong by yourself, Nils Holgersson,\" he said to himself. \"Now you must\nprove whether you have learned anything during these weeks in the open.\"\n\nA moment later the crows gave the signal to break up; and since it was\nstill their intention, apparently, to carry him along in such a way that\none held on to his shirt-band, and one to a stocking, the boy said: \"Is\nthere not one among you so strong that he can carry me on his back? You\nhave already travelled so badly with me that I feel as if I were in\npieces. Only let me ride! I'll not jump from the crow's back, that I\npromise you.\"\n\n\"Oh! you needn't think that we care how you have it,\" said the leader.\nBut now the largest of the crows--a dishevelled and uncouth one, who had\na white feather in his wing--came forward and said: \"It would certainly\nbe best for all of us, Wind-Rush, if Thumbietot got there whole, rather\nthan half, and therefore, I shall carry him on my back.\" \"If you can do\nit, Fumle-Drumle, I have no objection,\" said Wind-Rush. \"But don't lose\nhim!\"\n\nWith this, much was already gained, and the boy actually felt pleased\nagain. \"There is nothing to be gained by losing my grit because I have\nbeen kidnapped by the crows,\" thought he. \"I'll surely be able to manage\nthose poor little things.\"\n\nThe crows continued to fly southwest, over Sm\u00c3\u00a5land. It was a glorious\nmorning--sunny and calm; and the birds down on the earth were singing\ntheir best love songs. In a high, dark forest sat the thrush himself\nwith drooping wings and swelling throat, and struck up tune after tune.\n\"How pretty you are! How pretty you are! How pretty you are!\" sang he.\n\"No one is so pretty. No one is so pretty. No one is so pretty.\" As soon\nas he had finished this song, he began it all over again.\n\nBut just then the boy rode over the forest; and when he had heard the\nsong a couple of times, and marked that the thrush knew no other, he put\nboth hands up to his mouth as a speaking trumpet, and called down:\n\"We've heard all this before. We've heard all this before.\" \"Who is it?\nWho is it? Who is it? Who makes fun of me?\" asked the thrush, and tried\nto catch a glimpse of the one who called. \"It is Kidnapped-by-Crows who\nmakes fun of your song,\" answered the boy. At that, the crow-chief\nturned his head and said: \"Be careful of your eyes, Thumbietot!\" But the\nboy thought, \"Oh! I don't care about that. I want to show you that I'm\nnot afraid of you!\"\n\nFarther and farther inland they travelled; and there were woods and\nlakes everywhere. In a birch-grove sat the wood-dove on a naked branch,\nand before him stood the lady-dove. He blew up his feathers, cocked his\nhead, raised and lowered his body, until the breast-feathers rattled\nagainst the branch. All the while he cooed: \"Thou, thou, thou art the\nloveliest in all the forest. No one in the forest is so lovely as thou,\nthou, thou!\"\n\nBut up in the air the boy rode past, and when he heard Mr. Dove he\ncouldn't keep still. \"Don't you believe him! Don't you believe him!\"\ncried he.\n\n\"Who, who, who is it that lies about me?\" cooed Mr. Dove, and tried to\nget a sight of the one who shrieked at him. \"It is Caught-by-Crows that\nlies about you,\" replied the boy. Again Wind-Rush turned his head toward\nthe boy and commanded him to shut up, but Fumle-Drumle, who was carrying\nhim, said: \"Let him chatter, then all the little birds will think that\nwe crows have become quick-witted and funny birds.\" \"Oh! they're not\nsuch fools, either,\" said Wind-Rush; but he liked the idea just the\nsame, for after that he let the boy call out as much as he liked.\n\nThey flew mostly over forests and woodlands, but there were churches and\nparishes and little cabins in the outskirts of the forest. In one place\nthey saw a pretty old manor. It lay with the forest back of it, and the\nsea in front of it; had red walls and a turreted roof; great sycamores\nabout the grounds, and big, thick gooseberry-bushes in the orchard. On\nthe top of the weathercock sat the starling, and sang so loud that every\nnote was heard by the wife, who sat on an egg in the heart of a pear\ntree. \"We have four pretty little eggs,\" sang the starling. \"We have\nfour pretty little round eggs. We have the whole nest filled with fine\neggs.\"\n\nWhen the starling sang the song for the thousandth time, the boy rode\nover the place. He put his hands up to his mouth, as a pipe, and called:\n\"The magpie will get them. The magpie will get them.\"\n\n\"Who is it that wants to frighten me?\" asked the starling, and flapped\nhis wings uneasily. \"It is Captured-by-Crows that frightens you,\" said\nthe boy. This time the crow-chief didn't attempt to hush him up.\nInstead, both he and his flock were having so much fun that they cawed\nwith satisfaction.\n\nThe farther inland they came, the larger were the lakes, and the more\nplentiful were the islands and points. And on a lake-shore stood a drake\nand kowtowed before the duck. \"I'll be true to you all the days of my\nlife. I'll be true to you all the days of my life,\" said the drake. \"It\nwon't last until the summer's end,\" shrieked the boy. \"Who are you?\"\ncalled the drake. \"My name's Stolen-by-Crows,\" shrieked the boy.\n\nAt dinner time the crows lighted in a food-grove. They walked about and\nprocured food for themselves, but none of them thought about giving the\nboy anything. Then Fumle-Drumle came riding up to the chief with a\ndog-rose branch, with a few dried buds on it. \"Here's something for you,\nWind-Rush,\" said he. \"This is pretty food, and suitable for you.\"\nWind-Rush sniffed contemptuously. \"Do you think that I want to eat old,\ndry buds?\" said he. \"And I who thought that you would be pleased with\nthem!\" said Fumle-Drumle; and threw away the dog-rose branch as if in\ndespair. But it fell right in front of the boy, and he wasn't slow about\ngrabbing it and eating until he was satisfied.\n\nWhen the crows had eaten, they began to chatter. \"What are you thinking\nabout, Wind-Rush? You are so quiet to-day,\" said one of them to the\nleader. \"I'm thinking that in this district there lived, once upon a\ntime, a hen, who was very fond of her mistress; and in order to really\nplease her, she went and laid a nest full of eggs, which she hid under\nthe store-house floor. The mistress of the house wondered, of course,\nwhere the hen was keeping herself such a long time. She searched for\nher, but did not find her. Can you guess, Longbill, who it was that\nfound her and the eggs?\"\n\n\"I think I can guess it, Wind-Rush, but when you have told about this, I\nwill tell you something like it. Do you remember the big, black cat in\nHinneryd's parish house? She was dissatisfied because they always took\nthe new-born kittens from her, and drowned them. Just once did she\nsucceed in keeping them concealed, and that was when she had laid them\nin a haystack, out doors. She was pretty well pleased with those young\nkittens, but I believe that I got more pleasure out of them than she\ndid.\"\n\nNow they became so excited that they all talked at once. \"What kind of\nan accomplishment is that--to steal little kittens?\" said one. \"I once\nchased a young hare who was almost full-grown. That meant to follow him\nfrom covert to covert.\" He got no further before another took the words\nfrom him. \"It may be fun, perhaps, to annoy hens and cats, but I find it\nstill more remarkable that a crow can worry a human being. I once stole\na silver spoon--\"\n\nBut now the boy thought he was too good to sit and listen to such\ngabble. \"Now listen to me, you crows!\" said he. \"I think you ought to\nbe ashamed of yourselves to talk about all your wickedness. I have lived\namongst wild geese for three weeks, and of them I have never heard or\nseen anything but good. You must have a bad chief, since he permits you\nto rob and murder in this way. You ought to begin to lead new lives, for\nI can tell you that human beings have grown so tired of your wickedness\nthey are trying with all their might to root you out. And then there\nwill soon be an end of you.\"\n\nWhen Wind-Rush and the crows heard this, they were so furious that they\nintended to throw themselves upon him and tear him in pieces. But\nFumle-Drumle laughed and cawed, and stood in front of him. \"Oh, no, no!\"\nsaid he, and seemed absolutely terrified. \"What think you that Wind-Air\nwill say if you tear Thumbietot in pieces before he has gotten that\nsilver money for us?\" \"It has to be you, Fumle-Drumle, that's afraid of\nwomen-folk,\" said Rush. But, at any rate, both he and the others left\nThumbietot in peace.\n\nShortly after that the crows went further. Until now the boy thought\nthat Sm\u00c3\u00a5land wasn't such a poor country as he had heard. Of course it\nwas woody and full of mountain-ridges, but alongside the islands and\nlakes lay cultivated grounds, and any real desolation he hadn't come\nupon. But the farther inland they came, the fewer were the villages and\ncottages. Toward the last, he thought that he was riding over a\nveritable wilderness where he saw nothing but swamps and heaths and\njuniper-hills.\n\nThe sun had gone down, but it was still perfect daylight when the crows\nreached the large heather-heath. Wind-Rush sent a crow on ahead, to say\nthat he had met with success; and when it was known, Wind-Air, with\nseveral hundred crows from Crow-Ridge, flew to meet the arrivals. In the\nmidst of the deafening cawing which the crows emitted, Fumle-Drumle said\nto the boy: \"You have been so comical and so jolly during the trip that\nI am really fond of you. Therefore I want to give you some good advice.\nAs soon as we light, you'll be requested to do a bit of work which may\nseem very easy to you; but beware of doing it!\"\n\nSoon thereafter Fumle-Drumle put Nils Holgersson down in the bottom of\na sandpit. The boy flung himself down, rolled over, and lay there as\nthough he was simply done up with fatigue. Such a lot of crows fluttered\nabout him that the air rustled like a wind-storm, but he didn't look up.\n\n\"Thumbietot,\" said Wind-Rush, \"get up now! You shall help us with a\nmatter which will be very easy for you.\"\n\nThe boy didn't move, but pretended to be asleep. Then Wind-Rush took him\nby the arm, and dragged him over the sand to an earthen crock of\nold-time make, that was standing in the pit. \"Get up, Thumbietot,\" said\nhe, \"and open this crock!\" \"Why can't you let me sleep?\" said the boy.\n\"I'm too tired to do anything to-night. Wait until to-morrow!\"\n\n\"Open the crock!\" said Wind-Rush, shaking him. \"How shall a poor little\nchild be able to open such a crock? Why, it's quite as large as I am\nmyself.\" \"Open it!\" commanded Wind-Rush once more, \"or it will be a\nsorry thing for you.\" The boy got up, tottered over to the crock,\nfumbled the clasp, and let his arms fall. \"I'm not usually so weak,\"\nsaid he. \"If you will only let me sleep until morning, I think that I'll\nbe able to manage with that clasp.\"\n\nBut Wind-Rush was impatient, and he rushed forward and pinched the boy\nin the leg. That sort of treatment the boy didn't care to suffer from a\ncrow. He jerked himself loose quickly, ran a couple of paces backward,\ndrew his knife from the sheath, and held it extended in front of him.\n\"You'd better be careful!\" he cried to Wind-Rush.\n\nThis one too was so enraged that he didn't dodge the danger. He rushed\nat the boy, just as though he'd been blind, and ran so straight against\nthe knife, that it entered through his eye into the head. The boy drew\nthe knife back quickly, but Wind-Rush only struck out with his wings,\nthen he fell down--dead.\n\n\"Wind-Rush is dead! The stranger has killed our chieftain, Wind-Rush!\"\ncried the nearest crows, and then there was a terrible uproar. Some\nwailed, others cried for vengeance. They all ran or fluttered up to the\nboy, with Fumle-Drumle in the lead. But he acted badly as usual. He only\nfluttered and spread his wings over the boy, and prevented the others\nfrom coming forward and running their bills into him.\n\nThe boy thought that things looked very bad for him now. He couldn't run\naway from the crows, and there was no place where he could hide. Then he\nhappened to think of the earthen crock. He took a firm hold on the\nclasp, and pulled it off. Then he hopped into the crock to hide in it.\nBut the crock was a poor hiding place, for it was nearly filled to the\nbrim with little, thin silver coins. The boy couldn't get far enough\ndown, so he stooped and began to throw out the coins.\n\nUntil now the crows had fluttered around him in a thick swarm and pecked\nat him, but when he threw out the coins they immediately forgot their\nthirst for vengeance, and hurried to gather the money. The boy threw out\nhandfuls of it, and all the crows--yes, even Wind-Air herself--picked\nthem up. And everyone who succeeded in picking up a coin ran off to the\nnest with the utmost speed to conceal it.\n\nWhen the boy had thrown out all the silver pennies from the crock he\nglanced up. Not more than a single crow was left in the sandpit. That\nwas Fumle-Drumle, with the white feather in his wing; he who had carried\nThumbietot. \"You have rendered me a greater service than you\nunderstand,\" said the crow--with a very different voice, and a different\nintonation than the one he had used heretofore--\"and I want to save your\nlife. Sit down on my back, and I'll take you to a hiding place where you\ncan be secure for to-night. To-morrow, I'll arrange it so that you will\nget back to the wild geese.\"\n\nTHE CABIN\n\n_Thursday, April fourteenth_.\n\nThe following morning when the boy awoke, he lay in a bed. When he saw\nthat he was in a house with four walls around him, and a roof over him,\nhe thought that he was at home. \"I wonder if mother will come soon with\nsome coffee,\" he muttered to himself where he lay half-awake. Then he\nremembered that he was in a deserted cabin on the crow-ridge, and that\nFumle-Drumle with the white feather had borne him there the night\nbefore.\n\nThe boy was sore all over after the journey he had made the day before,\nand he thought it was lovely to lie still while he waited for\nFumle-Drumle who had promised to come and fetch him.\n\nCurtains of checked cotton hung before the bed, and he drew them aside\nto look out into the cabin. It dawned upon him instantly that he had\nnever seen the mate to a cabin like this. The walls consisted of nothing\nbut a couple of rows of logs; then the roof began. There was no interior\nceiling, so he could look clear up to the roof-tree. The cabin was so\nsmall that it appeared to have been built rather for such as he than for\nreal people. However, the fireplace and chimney were so large, he\nthought that he had never seen larger. The entrance door was in a\ngable-wall at the side of the fireplace, and was so narrow that it was\nmore like a wicket than a door. In the other gable-wall he saw a low and\nbroad window with many panes. There was scarcely any movable furniture\nin the cabin. The bench on one side, and the table under the window,\nwere also stationary--also the big bed where he lay, and the\nmany-coloured cupboard.\n\nThe boy could not help wondering who owned the cabin, and why it was\ndeserted. It certainly looked as though the people who had lived there\nexpected to return. The coffee-urn and the gruel-pot stood on the\nhearth, and there was some wood in the fireplace; the oven-rake and\nbaker's peel stood in a corner; the spinning wheel was raised on a\nbench; on the shelf over the window lay oakum and flax, a couple of\nskeins of yarn, a candle, and a bunch of matches.\n\nYes, it surely looked as if those who had lived there had intended to\ncome back. There were bed-clothes on the bed; and on the walls there\nstill hung long strips of cloth, upon which three riders named Kasper,\nMelchior, and Baltasar were painted. The same horses and riders were\npictured many times. They rode around the whole cabin, and continued\ntheir ride even up toward the joists.\n\nBut in the roof the boy saw something which brought him to his senses in\na jiffy. It was a couple of loaves of big bread-cakes that hung there\nupon a spit. They looked old and mouldy, but it was bread all the same.\nHe gave them a knock with the oven-rake and one piece fell to the floor.\nHe ate, and stuffed his bag full. It was incredible how good bread was,\nanyway.\n\nHe looked around the cabin once more, to try and discover if there was\nanything else which he might find useful to take along. \"I may as well\ntake what I need, since no one else cares about it,\" thought he. But\nmost of the things were too big and heavy. The only things that he\ncould carry might be a few matches perhaps.\n\nHe clambered up on the table, and swung with the help of the curtains up\nto the window-shelf. While he stood there and stuffed the matches into\nhis bag, the crow with the white feather came in through the window.\n\"Well here I am at last,\" said Fumle-Drumle as he lit on the table. \"I\ncouldn't get here any sooner because we crows have elected a new\nchieftain in Wind-Rush's place.\" \"Whom have you chosen?\" said the boy.\n\"Well, we have chosen one who will not permit robbery and injustice. We\nhave elected Garm Whitefeather, lately called Fumle-Drumle,\" answered\nhe, drawing himself up until he looked absolutely regal. \"That was a\ngood choice,\" said the boy and congratulated him. \"You may well wish me\nluck,\" said Garm; then he told the boy about the time they had had with\nWind-Rush and Wind-Air.\n\nDuring this recital the boy heard a voice outside the window which he\nthought sounded familiar. \"Is he here?\"--inquired the fox. \"Yes, he's\nhidden in there,\" answered a crow-voice. \"Be careful, Thumbietot!\" cried\nGarm. \"Wind-Air stands without with that fox who wants to eat you.\" More\nhe didn't have time to say, for Smirre dashed against the window. The\nold, rotten window-frame gave way, and the next second Smirre stood upon\nthe window-table. Garm Whitefeather, who didn't have time to fly away,\nhe killed instantly. Thereupon he jumped down to the floor, and looked\naround for the boy. He tried to hide behind a big oakum-spiral, but\nSmirre had already spied him, and was crouched for the final spring. The\ncabin was so small, and so low, the boy understood that the fox could\nreach him without the least difficulty. But just at that moment the boy\nwas not without weapons of defence. He struck a match quickly, touched\nthe curtains, and when they were in flames, he threw them down upon\nSmirre Fox. When the fire enveloped the fox, he was seized with a mad\nterror. He thought no more about the boy, but rushed wildly out of the\ncabin.\n\nBut it looked as if the boy had escaped one danger to throw himself into\na greater one. From the tuft of oakum which he had flung at Smirre the\nfire had spread to the bed-hangings. He jumped down and tried to smother\nit, but it blazed too quickly now. The cabin was soon filled with smoke,\nand Smirre Fox, who had remained just outside the window, began to grasp\nthe state of affairs within. \"Well, Thumbietot,\" he called out, \"which\ndo you choose now: to be broiled alive in there, or to come out here to\nme? Of course, I should prefer to have the pleasure of eating you; but\nin whichever way death meets you it will be dear to me.\"\n\nThe boy could not think but what the fox was right, for the fire was\nmaking rapid headway. The whole bed was now in a blaze, and smoke rose\nfrom the floor; and along the painted wall-strips the fire crept from\nrider to rider. The boy jumped up in the fireplace, and tried to open\nthe oven door, when he heard a key which turned around slowly in the\nlock. It must be human beings coming. And in the dire extremity in which\nhe found himself, he was not afraid, but only glad. He was already on\nthe threshold when the door opened. He saw a couple of children facing\nhim; but how they looked when they saw the cabin in flames, he took no\ntime to find out; but rushed past them into the open.\n\nHe didn't dare run far. He knew, of course, that Smirre Fox lay in wait\nfor him, and he understood that he must remain near the children. He\nturned round to see what sort of folk they were, but he hadn't looked at\nthem a second before he ran up to them and cried: \"Oh, good-day, Osa\ngoose-girl! Oh, good-day, little Mats!\"\n\nFor when the boy saw those children he forgot entirely where he was.\nCrows and burning cabin and talking animals had vanished from his\nmemory. He was walking on a stubble-field, in West Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g, tending a\ngoose-flock; and beside him, on the field, walked those same Sm\u00c3\u00a5land\nchildren, with their geese. As soon as he saw them, he ran up on the\nstone-hedge and shouted: \"Oh, good-day, Osa goose-girl! Oh, good-day,\nlittle Mats!\"\n\nBut when the children saw such a little creature coming up to them with\noutstretched hands, they grabbed hold of each other, took a couple of\nsteps backward, and looked scared to death.\n\nWhen the boy noticed their terror he woke up and remembered who he was.\nAnd then it seemed to him that nothing worse could happen to him than\nthat those children should see how he had been bewitched. Shame and\ngrief because he was no longer a human being overpowered him. He turned\nand fled. He knew not whither.\n\nBut a glad meeting awaited the boy when he came down to the heath. For\nthere, in the heather, he spied something white, and toward him came the\nwhite goosey-gander, accompanied by Dunfin. When the white one saw the\nboy running with such speed, he thought that dreadful fiends were\npursuing him. He flung him in all haste upon his back and flew off with\nhim.\n\n\nTHE OLD PEASANT WOMAN\n\n\n_Thursday, April fourteenth_.\n\nThree tired wanderers were out in the late evening in search of a night\nharbour. They travelled over a poor and desolate portion of northern\nSm\u00c3\u00a5land. But the sort of resting place which they wanted, they should\nhave been able to find; for they were no weaklings who asked for soft\nbeds or comfortable rooms. \"If one of these long mountain-ridges had a\npeak so high and steep that a fox couldn't in any way climb up to it,\nthen we should have a good sleeping-place,\" said one of them. \"If a\nsingle one of the big swamps was thawed out, and was so marshy and wet\nthat a fox wouldn't dare venture out on it, this, too, would be a right\ngood night harbour,\" said the second. \"If the ice on one of the large\nlakes we travel past were loose, so that a fox could not come out on\nit, then we should have found just what we are seeking,\" said the third.\n\nThe worst of it was that when the sun had gone down, two of the\ntravellers became so sleepy that every second they were ready to fall to\nthe ground. The third one, who could keep himself awake, grew more and\nmore uneasy as night approached. \"Then it was a misfortune that we came\nto a land where lakes and swamps are frozen, so that a fox can get\naround everywhere. In other places the ice has melted away; but now\nwe're well up in the very coldest Sm\u00c3\u00a5land, where spring has not as yet\narrived. I don't know how I shall ever manage to find a good\nsleeping-place! Unless I find some spot that is well protected, Smirre\nFox will be upon us before morning.\"\n\nHe gazed in all directions, but he saw no shelter where he could lodge.\nIt was a dark and chilly night, with wind and drizzle. It grew more\nterrible and disagreeable around him every second.\n\nThis may sound strange, perhaps, but the travellers didn't seem to have\nthe least desire to ask for house-room on any farm. They had already\npassed many parishes without knocking at a single door. Little hillside\ncabins on the outskirts of the forests, which all poor wanderers are\nglad to run across, they took no notice of either. One might almost be\ntempted to say they deserved to have a hard time of it, since they did\nnot seek help where it was to be had for the asking.\n\nBut finally, when it was so dark that there was scarcely a glimmer of\nlight left under the skies and the two who needed sleep journeyed on in\na kind of half-sleep, they happened into a farmyard which was a long way\noff from all neighbours. And not only did it lie there desolate, but it\nappeared to be uninhabited as well. No smoke rose from the chimney; no\nlight shone through the windows; no human being moved on the place. When\nthe one among the three who could keep awake, saw the place, he thought:\n\"Now come what may, we must try to get in here. Anything better we are\nnot likely to find.\"\n\nSoon after that, all three stood in the house-yard. Two of them fell\nasleep the instant they stood still, but the third looked about him\neagerly, to find where they could get under cover. It was not a small\nfarm. Beside the dwelling house and stable and smoke-house, there were\nlong ranges with granaries and storehouses and cattlesheds. But it all\nlooked awfully poor and dilapidated. The houses had gray, moss-grown,\nleaning walls, which seemed ready to topple over. In the roofs were\nyawning holes, and the doors hung aslant on broken hinges. It was\napparent that no one had taken the trouble to drive a nail into a wall\non this place for a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, he who was awake had figured out which house was the cowshed.\nHe roused his travelling companions from their sleep, and conducted them\nto the cowshed door. Luckily, this was not fastened with anything but a\nhook, which he could easily push up with a rod. He heaved a sigh of\nrelief at the thought that they should soon be in safety. But when the\ncowshed door swung open with a sharp creaking, he heard a cow begin to\nbellow. \"Are you coming at last, mistress?\" said she. \"I thought that\nyou didn't propose to give me any supper to-night.\"\n\nThe one who was awake stopped in the doorway, absolutely terrified when\nhe discovered that the cowshed was not empty. But he soon saw that there\nwas not more than one cow, and three or four chickens; and then he took\ncourage again. \"We are three poor travellers who want to come in\nsomewhere, where no fox can assail us, and no human being capture us,\"\nsaid he. \"We wonder if this can be a good place for us.\" \"I cannot\nbelieve but what it is,\" answered the cow. \"To be sure the walls are\npoor, but the fox does not walk through them as yet; and no one lives\nhere except an old peasant woman, who isn't at all likely to make a\ncaptive of anyone. But who are you?\" she continued, as she twisted in\nher stall to get a sight of the newcomers. \"I am Nils Holgersson from\nVemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g, who has been transformed into an elf,\" replied the first of\nthe incomers, \"and I have with me a tame goose, whom I generally ride,\nand a gray goose.\" \"Such rare guests have never before been within my\nfour walls,\" said the cow, \"and you shall be welcome, although I would\nhave preferred that it had been my mistress, come to give me my supper.\"\n\nThe boy led the geese into the cowshed, which was rather large, and\nplaced them in an empty manger, where they fell asleep instantly. For\nhimself, he made a little bed of straw and expected that he, too, should\ngo to sleep at once.\n\nBut this was impossible, for the poor cow, who hadn't had her supper,\nwasn't still an instant. She shook her flanks, moved around in the\nstall, and complained of how hungry she was. The boy couldn't get a wink\nof sleep, but lay there and lived over all the things that had happened\nto him during these last days.\n\nHe thought of Osa, the goose-girl, and little Mats, whom he had\nencountered so unexpectedly; and he fancied that the little cabin which\nhe had set on fire must have been their old home in Sm\u00c3\u00a5land. Now he\nrecalled that he had heard them speak of just such a cabin, and of the\nbig heather-heath which lay below it. Now Osa and Mats had wandered back\nthere to see their old home again, and then, when they had reached it,\nit was in flames.\n\nIt was indeed a great sorrow which he had brought upon them, and it hurt\nhim very much. If he ever again became a human being, he would try to\ncompensate them for the damage and miscalculation.\n\nThen his thoughts wandered to the crows. And when he thought of\nFumle-Drumle who had saved his life, and had met his own death so soon\nafter he had been elected chieftain, he was so distressed that tears\nfilled his eyes. He had had a pretty rough time of it these last few\ndays. But, anyway, it was a rare stroke of luck that the goosey-gander\nand Dunfin had found him. The goosey-gander had said that as soon as the\ngeese discovered that Thumbietot had disappeared, they had asked all\nthe small animals in the forest about him. They soon learned that a\nflock of Sm\u00c3\u00a5land crows had carried him off. But the crows were already\nout of sight, and whither they had directed their course no one had been\nable to say. That they might find the boy as soon as possible, Akka had\ncommanded the wild geese to start out--two and two--in different\ndirections, to search for him. But after a two days' hunt, whether or\nnot they had found him, they were to meet in northwestern Sm\u00c3\u00a5land on a\nhigh mountain-top, which resembled an abrupt, chopped-off tower, and was\ncalled Taberg. After Akka had given them the best directions, and\ndescribed carefully how they should find Taberg, they had separated.\n\nThe white goosey-gander had chosen Dunfin as travelling companion, and\nthey had flown about hither and thither with the greatest anxiety for\nThumbietot. During this ramble they had heard a thrush, who sat in a\ntree-top, cry and wail that someone, who called himself\nKidnapped-by-Crows, had made fun of him. They had talked with the\nthrush, and he had shown them in which direction that Kidnapped-by-Crows\nhad travelled. Afterward, they had met a dove-cock, a starling and a\ndrake; they had all wailed about a little culprit who had disturbed\ntheir song, and who was named Caught-by-Crows, Captured-by-Crows, and\nStolen-by-Crows. In this way, they were enabled to trace Thumbietot all\nthe way to the heather-heath in Sonnerbo township.\n\nAs soon as the goosey-gander and Dunfin had found Thumbietot, they had\nstarted toward the north, in order to reach Taberg. But it had been a\nlong road to travel, and the darkness was upon them before they had\nsighted the mountain top. \"If we only get there by to-morrow, surely all\nour troubles will be over,\" thought the boy, and dug down into the straw\nto have it warmer. All the while the cow fussed and fumed in the stall.\nThen, all of a sudden, she began to talk to the boy. \"Everything is\nwrong with me,\" said the cow. \"I am neither milked nor tended. I have no\nnight fodder in my manger, and no bed has been made under me. My\nmistress came here at dusk, to put things in order for me, but she felt\nso ill, that she had to go in soon again, and she has not returned.\"\n\n\"It's distressing that I should be little and powerless,\" said the boy.\n\"I don't believe that I am able to help you.\" \"You can't make me believe\nthat you are powerless because you are little,\" said the cow. \"All the\nelves that I've ever heard of, were so strong that they could pull a\nwhole load of hay and strike a cow dead with one fist.\" The boy couldn't\nhelp laughing at the cow. \"They were a very different kind of elf from\nme,\" said he. \"But I'll loosen your halter and open the door for you, so\nthat you can go out and drink in one of the pools on the place, and then\nI'll try to climb up to the hayloft and throw down some hay in your\nmanger.\" \"Yes, that would be some help,\" said the cow.\n\nThe boy did as he had said; and when the cow stood with a full manger in\nfront of her, he thought that at last he should get some sleep. But he\nhad hardly crept down in the bed before she began, anew, to talk to him.\n\n\"You'll be clean put out with me if I ask you for one thing more,\" said\nthe cow. \"Oh, no I won't, if it's only something that I'm able to do,\"\nsaid the boy. \"Then I will ask you to go into the cabin, directly\nopposite, and find out how my mistress is getting along. I fear some\nmisfortune has come to her.\" \"No! I can't do that,\" said the boy. \"I\ndare not show myself before human beings.\" \"'Surely you're not afraid of\nan old and sick woman,\" said the cow. \"But you do not need to go into\nthe cabin. Just stand outside the door and peep in through the crack!\"\n\"Oh! if that is all you ask of me, I'll do it of course,\" said the boy.\n\nWith that he opened the cowshed door and went out in the yard. It was a\nfearful night! Neither moon nor stars shone; the wind blew a gale, and\nthe rain came down in torrents. And the worst of all was that seven\ngreat owls sat in a row on the eaves of the cabin. It was awful just to\nhear them, where they sat and grumbled at the weather; but it was even\nworse to think what would happen to him if one of them should set eyes\non him. That would be the last of him.\n\n\"Pity him who is little!\" said the boy as he ventured out in the yard.\nAnd he had a right to say this, for he was blown down twice before he\ngot to the house: once the wind swept him into a pool, which was so deep\nthat he came near drowning. But he got there nevertheless.\n\nHe clambered up a pair of steps, scrambled over a threshold, and came\ninto the hallway. The cabin door was closed, but down in one corner a\nlarge piece had been cut away, that the cat might go in and out. It was\nno difficulty whatever for the boy to see how things were in the cabin.\n\nHe had hardly cast a glance in there before he staggered back and turned\nhis head away. An old, gray-haired woman lay stretched out on the floor\nwithin. She neither moved nor moaned; and her face shone strangely\nwhite. It was as if an invisible moon had thrown a feeble light over it.\n\nThe boy remembered that when his grandfather had died, his face had also\nbecome so strangely white-like. And he understood that the old woman who\nlay on the cabin floor must be dead. Death had probably come to her so\nsuddenly that she didn't even have time to lie down on her bed.\n\nAs he thought of being alone with the dead in the middle of the dark\nnight, he was terribly afraid. He threw himself headlong down the steps,\nand rushed back to the cowshed.\n\nWhen he told the cow what he had seen in the cabin, she stopped eating.\n\"So my mistress is dead,\" said she. \"Then it will soon be over for me\nas well.\" \"There will always be someone to look out for you,\" said the\nboy comfortingly. \"Ah! you don't know,\" said the cow, \"that I am already\ntwice as old as a cow usually is before she is laid upon the\nslaughter-bench. But then I do not care to live any longer, since she,\nin there, can come no more to care for me.\"\n\nShe said nothing more for a while, but the boy observed, no doubt, that\nshe neither slept nor ate. It was not long before she began to speak\nagain. \"Is she lying on the bare floor?\" she asked. \"She is,\" said the\nboy. \"She had a habit of coming out to the cowshed,\" she continued, \"and\ntalking about everything that troubled her. I understood what she said,\nalthough I could not answer her. These last few days she talked of how\nafraid she was lest there would be no one with her when she died. She\nwas anxious for fear no one should close her eyes and fold her hands\nacross her breast, after she was dead. Perhaps you'll go in and do\nthis?\" The boy hesitated. He remembered that when his grandfather had\ndied, mother had been very careful about putting everything to rights.\nHe knew this was something which had to be done. But, on the other hand,\nhe felt that he didn't care go to the dead, in the ghastly night. He\ndidn't say no; neither did he take a step toward the cowshed door. For a\ncouple of seconds the old cow was silent--just as if she had expected an\nanswer. But when the boy said nothing, she did not repeat her request.\nInstead, she began to talk with him of her mistress.\n\nThere was much to tell, first and foremost, about all the children which\nshe had brought up. They had been in the cowshed every day, and in the\nsummer they had taken the cattle to pasture on the swamp and in the\ngroves, so the old cow knew all about them. They had been splendid, all\nof them, and happy and industrious. A cow knew well enough what her\ncaretakers were good for.\n\nThere was also much to be said about the farm. It had not always been as\npoor as it was now. It was very large--although the greater part of it\nconsisted of swamps and stony groves. There was not much room for\nfields, but there was plenty of good fodder everywhere. At one time\nthere had been a cow for every stall in the cowshed; and the oxshed,\nwhich was now empty, had at one time been filled with oxen. And then\nthere was life and gayety, both in cabin and cowhouse. When the mistress\nopened the cowshed door she would hum and sing, and all the cows lowed\nwith gladness when they heard her coming.\n\nBut the good man had died when the children were so small that they\ncould not be of any assistance, and the mistress had to take charge of\nthe farm, and all the work and responsibility. She had been as strong as\na man, and had both ploughed and reaped. In the evenings, when she came\ninto the cowshed to milk, sometimes she was so tired that she wept. Then\nshe dashed away her tears, and was cheerful again. \"It doesn't matter.\nGood times are coming again for me too, if only my children grow up.\nYes, if they only grow up.\"\n\nBut as soon as the children were grown, a strange longing came over\nthem. They didn't want to stay at home, but went away to a strange\ncountry. Their mother never got any help from them. A couple of her\nchildren were married before they went away, and they had left their\nchildren behind, in the old home. And now these children followed the\nmistress in the cowshed, just as her own had done. They tended the cows,\nand were fine, good folk. And, in the evenings, when the mistress was so\ntired out that she could fall asleep in the middle of the milking, she\nwould rouse herself again to renewed courage by thinking of them. \"Good\ntimes are coming for me, too,\" said she--and shook off sleep--\"when once\nthey are grown.\"\n\nBut when these children grew up, they went away to their parents in the\nstrange land. No one came back--no one stayed at home--the old mistress\nwas left alone on the farm.\n\nProbably she had never asked them to remain with her. \"Think you,\nR\u00c3\u00b6dlinna, that I would ask them to stay here with me, when they can go\nout in the world and have things comfortable?\" she would say as she\nstood in the stall with the old cow. \"Here in Sm\u00c3\u00a5land they have only\npoverty to look forward to.\"\n\nBut when the last grandchild was gone, it was all up with the mistress.\nAll at once she became bent and gray, and tottered as she walked; as if\nshe no longer had the strength to move about. She stopped working. She\ndid not care to look after the farm, but let everything go to rack and\nruin. She didn't repair the houses; and she sold both the cows and the\noxen. The only one that she kept was the old cow who now talked with\nThumbietot. Her she let live because all the children had tended her.\n\nShe could have taken maids and farm-hands into her service, who would\nhave helped her with the work, but she couldn't bear to see strangers\naround her, since her own had deserted her. Perhaps she was better\nsatisfied to let the farm go to ruin, since none of her children were\ncoming back to take it after she was gone. She did not mind that she\nherself became poor, because she didn't value that which was only hers.\nBut she was troubled lest the children should find out how hard she had\nit. \"If only the children do not hear of this! If only the children do\nnot hear of this!\" she sighed as she tottered through the cowhouse.\n\nThe children wrote constantly, and begged her to come out to them; but\nthis she did not wish. She didn't want to see the land that had taken\nthem from her. She was angry with it. \"It's foolish of me, perhaps, that\nI do not like that land which has been so good for them,\" said she. \"But\nI don't want to see it.\"\n\nShe never thought of anything but the children, and of this--that they\nmust needs have gone. When summer came, she led the cow out to graze in\nthe big swamp. All day she would sit on the edge of the swamp, her hands\nin her lap; and on the way home she would say: \"You see, R\u00c3\u00b6dlinna, if\nthere had been large, rich fields here, in place of these barren swamps,\nthen there would have been no need for them to leave.\"\n\nShe could become furious with the swamp which spread out so big, and did\nno good. She could sit and talk about how it was the swamp's fault that\nthe children had left her.\n\nThis last evening she had been more trembly and feeble than ever before.\nShe could not even do the milking. She had leaned against the manger\nand talked about two strangers who had been to see her, and had asked if\nthey might buy the swamp. They wanted to drain it, and sow and raise\ngrain on it. This had made her both anxious and glad. \"Do you hear,\nR\u00c3\u00b6dlinna,\" she had said, \"do you hear they said that grain can grow on\nthe swamp? Now I shall write to the children to come home. Now they'll\nnot have to stay away any longer; for now they can get their bread here\nat home.\" It was this that she had gone into the cabin to do--\n\nThe boy heard no more of what the old cow said. He had opened the\ncowhouse door and gone across the yard, and in to the dead whom he had\nbut lately been so afraid of.\n\nIt was not so poor in the cabin as he had expected. It was well supplied\nwith the sort of things one generally finds among those who have\nrelatives in America. In a corner there was an American rocking chair;\non the table before the window lay a brocaded plush cover; there was a\npretty spread on the bed; on the walls, in carved-wood frames, hung the\nphotographs of the children and grandchildren who had gone away; on the\nbureau stood high vases and a couple of candlesticks, with thick, spiral\ncandles in them.\n\nThe boy searched for a matchbox and lighted these candles, not because\nhe needed more light than he already had; but because he thought that\nthis was one way to honour the dead.\n\nThen he went up to her, closed her eyes, folded her hands across her\nbreast, and stroked back the thin gray hair from her face.\n\nHe thought no more about being afraid of her. He was so deeply grieved\nbecause she had been forced to live out her old age in loneliness and\nlonging. He, at least, would watch over her dead body this night.\n\nHe hunted up the psalm book, and seated himself to read a couple of\npsalms in an undertone. But in the middle of the reading he\npaused--because he had begun to think about his mother and father.\n\nThink, that parents can long so for their children! This he had never\nknown. Think, that life can be as though it was over for them when the\nchildren are away! Think, if those at home longed for him in the same\nway that this old peasant woman had longed!\n\nThis thought made him happy, but he dared not believe in it. He had not\nbeen such a one that anybody could long for him.\n\nBut what he had not been, perhaps he could become.\n\nRound about him he saw the portraits of those who were away. They were\nbig, strong men and women with earnest faces. There were brides in long\nveils, and gentlemen in fine clothes; and there were children with waved\nhair and pretty white dresses. And he thought that they all stared\nblindly into vacancy--and did not want to see.\n\n\"Poor you!\" said the boy to the portraits. \"Your mother is dead. You\ncannot make reparation now, because you went away from her. But my\nmother is living!\"\n\nHere he paused, and nodded and smiled to himself. \"My mother is living,\"\nsaid he. \"Both father and mother are living.\"\n\n\nFROM TABERG TO HUSKVARNA\n\n\n_Friday, April fifteenth_.\n\nThe boy sat awake nearly all night, but toward morning he fell asleep\nand then he dreamed of his father and mother. He could hardly recognise\nthem. They had both grown gray, and had old and wrinkled faces. He asked\nhow this had come about, and they answered that they had aged so because\nthey had longed for him. He was both touched and astonished, for he had\nnever believed but what they were glad to be rid of him.\n\nWhen the boy awoke the morning was come, with fine, clear weather.\nFirst, he himself ate a bit of bread which he found in the cabin; then\nhe gave morning feed to both geese and cow, and opened the cowhouse door\nso that the cow could go over to the nearest farm. When the cow came\nalong all by herself the neighbours would no doubt understand that\nsomething was wrong with her mistress. They would hurry over to the\ndesolate farm to see how the old woman was getting along, and then they\nwould find her dead body and bury it.\n\nThe boy and the geese had barely raised themselves into the air, when\nthey caught a glimpse of a high mountain, with almost perpendicular\nwalls, and an abrupt, broken-off top; and they understood that this\nmust be Taberg. On the summit stood Akka, with Yksi and Kaksi, Kolmi and\nNelj\u00c3\u00a4, Viisi and Knusi, and all six goslings and waited for them. There\nwas a rejoicing, and a cackling, and a fluttering, and a calling which\nno one can describe, when they saw that the goosey-gander and Dunfin had\nsucceeded in finding Thumbietot.\n\nThe woods grew pretty high up on Taberg's sides, but her highest peak\nwas barren; and from there one could look out in all directions. If one\ngazed toward the east, or south, or west, then there was hardly anything\nto be seen but a poor highland with dark spruce-trees, brown morasses,\nice-clad lakes, and bluish mountain-ridges. The boy couldn't keep from\nthinking it was true that the one who had created this hadn't taken very\ngreat pains with his work, but had thrown it together in a hurry. But if\none glanced to the north, it was altogether different. Here it looked as\nif it had been worked out with the utmost care and affection. In this\ndirection one saw only beautiful mountains, soft valleys, and winding\nrivers, all the way to the big Lake Vettern, which lay ice-free and\ntransparently clear, and shone as if it wasn't filled with water but\nwith blue light.\n\nIt was Vettern that made it so pretty to look toward the north, because\nit looked as though a blue stream had risen up from the lake, and spread\nitself over land also. Groves and hills and roofs, and the spires of\nJ\u00c3\u00b6nk\u00c3\u00b6ping City--which shimmered along Vettern's shores--lay enveloped in\npale blue which caressed the eye. If there were countries in heaven,\nthey, too, must be blue like this, thought the boy, and imagined that he\nhad gotten a faint idea of how it must look in Paradise.\n\nLater in the day, when the geese continued their journey, they flew up\ntoward the blue valley. They were in holiday humour; shrieked and made\nsuch a racket that no one who had ears could help hearing them.\n\nThis happened to be the first really fine spring day they had had in\nthis section. Until now, the spring had done its work under rain and\nbluster; and now, when it had all of a sudden become fine weather, the\npeople were filled with such a longing after summer warmth and green\nwoods that they could hardly perform their tasks. And when the wild\ngeese rode by, high above the ground, cheerful and free, there wasn't\none who did not drop what he had in hand, and glance at them.\n\nThe first ones who saw the wild geese that day were miners on Taberg,\nwho were digging ore at the mouth of the mine. When they heard them\ncackle, they paused in their drilling for ore, and one of them called to\nthe birds: \"Where are you going? Where are you going?\" The geese didn't\nunderstand what he said, but the boy leaned forward over the goose-back,\nand answered for them: \"Where there is neither pick nor hammer.\" When\nthe miners heard the words, they thought it was their own longing that\nmade the goose-cackle sound like human speech. \"Take us along with you!\nTake us along with you!\" they cried. \"Not this year,\" shrieked the boy.\n\"Not this year.\"\n\nThe wild geese followed Taberg River down toward Monk Lake, and all the\nwhile they made the same racket. Here, on the narrow land-strip between\nMonk and Vettern lakes, lay J\u00c3\u00b6nk\u00c3\u00b6ping with its great factories. The wild\ngeese rode first over Monksj\u00c3\u00b6 paper mills. The noon rest hour was just\nover, and the big workmen were streaming down to the mill-gate. When\nthey heard the wild geese, they stopped a moment to listen to them.\n\"Where are you going? Where are you going?\" called the workmen. The wild\ngeese understood nothing of what they said, but the boy answered for\nthem: \"There, where there are neither machines nor steam-boxes.\" When\nthe workmen heard the answer, they believed it was their own longing\nthat made the goose-cackle sound like human speech. \"Take us along with\nyou!\" \"Not this year,\" answered the boy. \"Not this year.\"\n\nNext, the geese rode over the well-known match factory, which lies on\nthe shores of Vettern--large as a fortress--and lifts its high chimneys\ntoward the sky. Not a soul moved out in the yards; but in a large hall\nyoung working-women sat and filled match-boxes. They had opened a window\non account of the beautiful weather, and through it came the wild\ngeese's call. The one who sat nearest the window, leaned out with a\nmatch-box in her hand, and cried: \"Where are you going? Where are you\ngoing?\" \"To that land where there is no need of either light or\nmatches,\" said the boy. The girl thought that what she had heard was\nonly goose-cackle; but since she thought she had distinguished a couple\nof words, she called out in answer: \"Take me along with you!\" \"Not this\nyear,\" replied the boy. \"Not this year.\"\n\nEast of the factories rises J\u00c3\u00b6nk\u00c3\u00b6ping, on the most glorious spot that\nany city can occupy. The narrow Vettern has high, steep sand-shores,\nboth on the eastern and western sides; but straight south, the\nsand-walls are broken down, just as if to make room for a large gate,\nthrough which one reaches the lake. And in the middle of the gate--with\nmountains to the left, and mountains to the right, with Monk Lake behind\nit, and Vettern in front of it--lies J\u00c3\u00b6nk\u00c3\u00b6ping.\n\nThe wild geese travelled forward over the long, narrow city, and behaved\nthemselves here just as they had done in the country. But in the city\nthere was no one who answered them. It was not to be expected that city\nfolks should stop out in the streets, and call to the wild geese.\n\nThe trip extended further along Vettern's shores; and after a little\nthey came to Sanna Sanitarium. Some of the patients had gone out on the\nveranda to enjoy the spring air, and in this way they heard the\ngoose-cackle. \"Where are you going?\" asked one of them with such a\nfeeble voice that he was scarcely heard. \"To that land where there is\nneither sorrow nor sickness,\" answered the boy. \"Take us along with\nyou!\" said the sick ones. \"Not this year,\" answered the boy. \"Not this\nyear.\"\n\nWhen they had travelled still farther on, they came to Huskvarna. It lay\nin a valley. The mountains around it were steep and beautifully formed.\nA river rushed along the heights in long and narrow falls. Big workshops\nand factories lay below the mountain walls; and scattered over the\nvalley-bottom were the workingmens' homes, encircled by little gardens;\nand in the centre of the valley lay the schoolhouse. Just as the wild\ngeese came along, a bell rang, and a crowd of school children marched\nout in line. They were so numerous that the whole schoolyard was filled\nwith them. \"Where are you going? Where are you going?\" the children\nshouted when they heard the wild geese. \"Where there are neither books\nnor lessons to be found,\" answered the boy. \"Take us along!\" shrieked\nthe children. \"Not this year, but next,\" cried the boy. \"Not this year,\nbut next.\"\n\n\nTHE BIG BIRD LAKE\n\n\nJARRO, THE WILD DUCK\n\nOn the eastern shore of Vettern lies Mount Omberg; east of Omberg lies\nDagmosse; east of Dagmosse lies Lake Takern. Around the whole of Takern\nspreads the big, even \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6ta plain.\n\nTakern is a pretty large lake and in olden times it must have been still\nlarger. But then the people thought it covered entirely too much of the\nfertile plain, so they attempted to drain the water from it, that they\nmight sow and reap on the lake-bottom. But they did not succeed in\nlaying waste the entire lake--which had evidently been their\nintention--therefore it still hides a lot of land. Since the draining\nthe lake has become so shallow that hardly at any point is it more than\na couple of metres deep. The shores have become marshy and muddy; and\nout in the lake, little mud-islets stick up above the water's surface.\n\nNow, there is one who loves to stand with his feet in the water, if he\ncan just keep his body and head in the air, and that is the reed. And it\ncannot find a better place to grow upon, than the long, shallow Takern\nshores, and around the little mud-islets. It thrives so well that it\ngrows taller than a man's height, and so thick that it is almost\nimpossible to push a boat through it. It forms a broad green enclosure\naround the whole lake, so that it is only accessible in a few places\nwhere the people have taken away the reeds.\n\nBut if the reeds shut the people out, they give, in return, shelter and\nprotection to many other things. In the reeds there are a lot of little\ndams and canals with green, still water, where duckweed and pondweed run\nto seed; and where gnat-eggs and blackfish and worms are hatched out in\nuncountable masses. And all along the shores of these little dams and\ncanals, there are many well-concealed places, where seabirds hatch their\neggs, and bring up their young without being disturbed, either by\nenemies or food worries.\n\nAn incredible number of birds live in the Takern reeds; and more and\nmore gather there every year, as it becomes known what a splendid abode\nit is. The first who settled there were the wild ducks; and they still\nlive there by thousands. But they no longer own the entire lake, for\nthey have been obliged to share it with swans, grebes, coots, loons,\nfen-ducks, and a lot of others.\n\nTakern is certainly the largest and choicest bird lake in the whole\ncountry; and the birds may count themselves lucky as long as they own\nsuch a retreat. But it is uncertain just how long they will be in\ncontrol of reeds and mud-banks, for human beings cannot forget that the\nlake extends over a considerable portion of good and fertile soil; and\nevery now and then the proposition to drain it comes up among them. And\nif these propositions were carried out, the many thousands of\nwater-birds would be forced to move from this quarter.\n\nAt the time when Nils Holgersson travelled around with the wild geese,\nthere lived at Takern a wild duck named Jarro. He was a young bird, who\nhad only lived one summer, one fall, and a winter; now, it was his first\nspring. He had just returned from South Africa, and had reached Takern\nin such good season that the ice was still on the lake.\n\nOne evening, when he and the other young wild ducks played at racing\nbackward and forward over the lake, a hunter fired a couple of shots at\nthem, and Jarro was wounded in the breast. He thought he should die; but\nin order that the one who had shot him shouldn't get him into his power,\nhe continued to fly as long as he possibly could. He didn't think\nwhither he was directing his course, but only struggled to get far\naway. When his strength failed him, so that he could not fly any\nfarther, he was no longer on the lake. He had flown a bit inland, and\nnow he sank down before the entrance to one of the big farms which lie\nalong the shores of Takern.\n\nA moment later a young farm-hand happened along. He saw Jarro, and came\nand lifted him up. But Jarro, who asked for nothing but to be let die in\npeace, gathered his last powers and nipped the farm-hand in the finger,\nso he should let go of him.\n\nJarro didn't succeed in freeing himself. The encounter had this good in\nit at any rate: the farm-hand noticed that the bird was alive. He\ncarried him very gently into the cottage, and showed him to the mistress\nof the house--a young woman with a kindly face. At once she took Jarro\nfrom the farm-hand, stroked him on the back and wiped away the blood\nwhich trickled down through the neck-feathers. She looked him over very\ncarefully; and when she saw how pretty he was, with his dark-green,\nshining head, his white neck-band, his brownish-red back, and his blue\nwing-mirror, she must have thought that it was a pity for him to die.\nShe promptly put a basket in order, and tucked the bird into it.\n\nAll the while Jarro fluttered and struggled to get loose; but when he\nunderstood that the people didn't intend to kill him, he settled down in\nthe basket with a sense of pleasure. Now it was evident how exhausted he\nwas from pain and loss of blood. The mistress carried the basket across\nthe floor to place it in the corner by the fireplace; but before she put\nit down Jarro was already fast asleep.\n\nIn a little while Jarro was awakened by someone who nudged him gently.\nWhen he opened his eyes he experienced such an awful shock that he\nalmost lost his senses. Now he was lost; for there stood _the_ one who\nwas more dangerous than either human beings or birds of prey. It was no\nless a thing than Caesar himself--the long-haired dog--who nosed around\nhim inquisitively.\n\nHow pitifully scared had he not been last summer, when he was still a\nlittle yellow-down duckling, every time it had sounded over the\nreed-stems: \"Caesar is coming! Caesar is coming!\" When he had seen the\nbrown and white spotted dog with the teeth-filled jowls come wading\nthrough the reeds, he had believed that he beheld death itself. He had\nalways hoped that he would never have to live through that moment when\nhe should meet Caesar face to face.\n\nBut, to his sorrow, he must have fallen down in the very yard where\nCaesar lived, for there he stood right over him. \"Who are you?\" he\ngrowled. \"How did you get into the house? Don't you belong down among\nthe reed banks?\"\n\nIt was with great difficulty that he gained the courage to answer.\n\"Don't be angry with me, Caesar, because I came into the house!\" said\nhe. \"It isn't my fault. I have been wounded by a gunshot. It was the\npeople themselves who laid me in this basket.\"\n\n\"Oho! so it's the folks themselves that have placed you here,\" said\nCaesar. \"Then it is surely their intention to cure you; although, for my\npart, I think it would be wiser for them to eat you up, since you are in\ntheir power. But, at any rate, you are tabooed in the house. You needn't\nlook so scared. Now, we're not down on Takern.\"\n\nWith that Caesar laid himself to sleep in front of the blazing log-fire.\nAs soon as Jarro understood that this terrible danger was past, extreme\nlassitude came over him, and he fell asleep anew.\n\nThe next time Jarro awoke, he saw that a dish with grain and water stood\nbefore him. He was still quite ill, but he felt hungry nevertheless, and\nbegan to eat. When the mistress saw that he ate, she came up and petted\nhim, and looked pleased. After that, Jarro fell asleep again. For\nseveral days he did nothing but eat and sleep.\n\nOne morning Jarro felt so well that he stepped from the basket and\nwandered along the floor. But he hadn't gone very far before he keeled\nover, and lay there. Then came Caesar, opened his big jaws and grabbed\nhim. Jarro believed, of course, that the dog was going to bite him to\ndeath; but Caesar carried him back to the basket without harming him.\nBecause of this, Jarro acquired such a confidence in the dog Caesar,\nthat on his next walk in the cottage, he went over to the dog and lay\ndown beside him. Thereafter Caesar and he became good friends, and every\nday, for several hours, Jarro lay and slept between Caesar's paws.\n\nBut an even greater affection than he felt for Caesar, did Jarro feel\ntoward his mistress. Of her he had not the least fear; but rubbed his\nhead against her hand when she came and fed him. Whenever she went out\nof the cottage he sighed with regret; and when she came back he cried\nwelcome to her in his own language.\n\nJarro forgot entirely how afraid he had been of both dogs and humans in\nother days. He thought now that they were gentle and kind, and he loved\nthem. He wished that he were well, so he could fly down to Takern and\ntell the wild ducks that their enemies were not dangerous, and that they\nneed not fear them.\n\nHe had observed that the human beings, as well as Caesar, had calm eyes,\nwhich it did one good to look into. The only one in the cottage whose\nglance he did not care to meet, was Clawina, the house cat. She did him\nno harm, either, but he couldn't place any confidence in her. Then, too,\nshe quarrelled with him constantly, because he loved human beings. \"You\nthink they protect you because they are fond of you,\" said Clawina. \"You\njust wait until you are fat enough! Then they'll wring the neck off you.\nI know them, I do.\"\n\nJarro, like all birds, had a tender and affectionate heart; and he was\nunutterably distressed when he heard this. He couldn't imagine that his\nmistress would wish to wring the neck off him, nor could he believe any\nsuch thing of her son, the little boy who sat for hours beside his\nbasket, and babbled and chattered. He seemed to think that both of them\nhad the same love for him that he had for them.\n\nOne day, when Jarro and Caesar lay on the usual spot before the fire,\nClawina sat on the hearth and began to tease the wild duck.\n\n\"I wonder, Jarro, what you wild ducks will do next year, when Takern is\ndrained and turned into grain fields?\" said Clawina. \"What's that you\nsay, Clawina?\" cried Jarro, and jumped up--scared through and through.\n\"I always forget, Jarro, that you do not understand human speech, like\nCaesar and myself,\" answered the cat. \"Or else you surely would have\nheard how the men, who were here in the cottage yesterday, said that all\nthe water was going to be drained from Takern, and that next year the\nlake-bottom would be as dry as a house-floor. And now I wonder where you\nwild ducks will go.\" When Jarro heard this talk he was so furious that\nhe hissed like a snake. \"You are just as mean as a common coot!\" he\nscreamed at Clawina. \"You only want to incite me against human beings. I\ndon't believe they want to do anything of the sort. They must know that\nTakern is the wild ducks' property. Why should they make so many birds\nhomeless and unhappy? You have certainly hit upon all this to scare me.\nI hope that you may be torn in pieces by Gorgo, the eagle! I hope that\nmy mistress will chop off your whiskers!\"\n\nBut Jarro couldn't shut Clawina up with this outburst. \"So you think I'm\nlying,\" said she. \"Ask Caesar, then! He was also in the house last\nnight. Caesar never lies.\"\n\n\"Caesar,\" said Jarro, \"you understand human speech much better than\nClawina. Say that she hasn't heard aright! Think how it would be if the\npeople drained Takern, and changed the lake-bottom into fields! Then\nthere would be no more pondweed or duck-food for the grown wild ducks,\nand no blackfish or worms or gnat-eggs for the ducklings. Then the\nreed-banks would disappear--where now the ducklings conceal themselves\nuntil they are able to fly. All ducks would be compelled to move away\nfrom here and seek another home. But where shall they find a retreat\nlike Takern? Caesar, say that Clawina has not heard aright!\"\n\nIt was extraordinary to watch Caesar's behaviour during this\nconversation. He had been wide-awake the whole time before, but now,\nwhen Jarro turned to him, he panted, laid his long nose on his forepaws,\nand was sound asleep within the wink of an eyelid.\n\nThe cat looked down at Caesar with a knowing smile. \"I believe that\nCaesar doesn't care to answer you,\" she said to Jarro. \"It is with him\nas with all dogs; they will never acknowledge that humans can do any\nwrong. But you can rely upon my word, at any rate. I shall tell you why\nthey wish to drain the lake just now. As long as you wild ducks still\nhad the power on Takern, they did not wish to drain it, for, at least,\nthey got some good out of you; but now, grebes and coots and other birds\nwho are no good as food, have infested nearly all the reed-banks, and\nthe people don't think they need let the lake remain on their account.\"\n\nJarro didn't trouble himself to answer Clawina, but raised his head, and\nshouted in Caesar's ear: \"Caesar! You know that on Takern there are\nstill so many ducks left that they fill the air like clouds. Say it\nisn't true that human beings intend to make all of these homeless!\"\n\nThen Caesar sprang up with such a sudden outburst at Clawina that she\nhad to save herself by jumping up on a shelf. \"I'll teach you to keep\nquiet when I want to sleep,\" bawled Caesar. \"Of course I know that there\nis some talk about draining the lake this year. But there's been talk of\nthis many times before without anything coming of it. And that draining\nbusiness is a matter in which I take no stock whatever. For how would it\ngo with the game if Takern were laid waste. You're a donkey to gloat\nover a thing like that. What will you and I have to amuse ourselves\nwith, when there are no more birds on Takern?\"\n\nTHE DECOY-DUCK\n\n_Sunday, April seventeenth_.\n\nA couple of days later Jarro was so well that he could fly all about the\nhouse. Then he was petted a good deal by the mistress, and the little\nboy ran out in the yard and plucked the first grass-blades for him which\nhad sprung up. When the mistress caressed him, Jarro thought that,\nalthough he was now so strong that he could fly down to Takern at any\ntime, he shouldn't care to be separated from the human beings. He had no\nobjection to remaining with them all his life.\n\nBut early one morning the mistress placed a halter, or noose, over\nJarro, which prevented him from using his wings, and then she turned him\nover to the farm-hand who had found him in the yard. The farm-hand poked\nhim under his arm, and went down to Takern with him.\n\nThe ice had melted away while Jarro had been ill. The old, dry fall\nleaves still stood along the shores and islets, but all the\nwater-growths had begun to take root down in the deep; and the green\nstems had already reached the surface. And now nearly all the migratory\nbirds were at home. The curlews' hooked bills peeped out from the reeds.\nThe grebes glided about with new feather-collars around the neck; and\nthe jack-snipes were gathering straws for their nests.\n\nThe farm-hand got into a scow, laid Jarro in the bottom of the boat, and\nbegan to pole himself out on the lake. Jarro, who had now accustomed\nhimself to expect only good of human beings, said to Caesar, who was\nalso in the party, that he was very grateful toward the farm-hand for\ntaking him out on the lake. But there was no need to keep him so closely\nguarded, for he did not intend to fly away. To this Caesar made no\nreply. He was very close-mouthed that morning.\n\nThe only thing which struck Jarro as being a bit peculiar was that the\nfarm-hand had taken his gun along. He couldn't believe that any of the\ngood folk in the cottage would want to shoot birds. And, beside, Caesar\nhad told him that the people didn't hunt at this time of the year. \"It\nis a prohibited time,\" he had said, \"although this doesn't concern me,\nof course.\"\n\nThe farm-hand went over to one of the little reed-enclosed mud-islets.\nThere he stepped from the boat, gathered some old reeds into a pile,\nand lay down behind it. Jarro was permitted to wander around on the\nground, with the halter over his wings, and tethered to the boat, with a\nlong string.\n\nSuddenly Jarro caught sight of some young ducks and drakes, in whose\ncompany he had formerly raced backward and forward over the lake. They\nwere a long way off, but Jarro called them to him with a couple of loud\nshouts. They responded, and a large and beautiful flock approached.\nBefore they got there, Jarro began to tell them about his marvellous\nrescue, and of the kindness of human beings. Just then, two shots\nsounded behind him. Three ducks sank down in the reeds--lifeless--and\nCaesar bounced out and captured them.\n\nThen Jarro understood. The human beings had only saved him that they\nmight use him as a decoy-duck. And they had also succeeded. Three ducks\nhad died on his account. He thought he should die of shame. He thought\nthat even his friend Caesar looked contemptuously at him; and when they\ncame home to the cottage, he didn't dare lie down and sleep beside the\ndog.\n\nThe next morning Jarro was again taken out on the shallows. This time,\ntoo, he saw some ducks. But when he observed that they flew toward him,\nhe called to them: \"Away! Away! Be careful! Fly in another direction!\nThere's a hunter hidden behind the reed-pile. I'm only a decoy-bird!\"\nAnd he actually succeeded in preventing them from coming within shooting\ndistance.\n\nJarro had scarcely had time to taste of a grass-blade, so busy was he in\nkeeping watch. He called out his warning as soon as a bird drew nigh. He\neven warned the grebes, although he detested them because they crowded\nthe ducks out of their best hiding-places. But he did not wish that any\nbird should meet with misfortune on his account. And, thanks to Jarro's\nvigilance, the farm-hand had to go home without firing off a single\nshot.\n\nDespite this fact, Caesar looked less displeased than on the previous\nday; and when evening came he took Jarro in his mouth, carried him over\nto the fireplace, and let him sleep between his forepaws.\n\nNevertheless Jarro was no longer contented in the cottage, but was\ngrievously unhappy. His heart suffered at the thought that humans never\nhad loved him. When the mistress, or the little boy, came forward to\ncaress him, he stuck his bill under his wing and pretended that he\nslept.\n\nFor several days Jarro continued his distressful watch-service; and\nalready he was known all over Takern. Then it happened one morning,\nwhile he called as usual: \"Have a care, birds! Don't come near me! I'm\nonly a decoy-duck,\" that a grebe-nest came floating toward the shallows\nwhere he was tied. This was nothing especially remarkable. It was a nest\nfrom the year before; and since grebe-nests are built in such a way that\nthey can move on water like boats, it often happens that they drift out\ntoward the lake. Still Jarro stood there and stared at the nest, because\nit came so straight toward the islet that it looked as though someone\nhad steered its course over the water.\n\nAs the nest came nearer, Jarro saw that a little human being--the\ntiniest he had ever seen--sat in the nest and rowed it forward with a\npair of sticks. And this little human called to him: \"Go as near the\nwater as you can, Jarro, and be ready to fly. You shall soon be freed.\"\n\nA few seconds later the grebe-nest lay near land, but the little oarsman\ndid not leave it, but sat huddled up between branches and straw. Jarro\ntoo held himself almost immovable. He was actually paralysed with fear\nlest the rescuer should be discovered.\n\nThe next thing which occurred was that a flock of wild geese came along.\nThen Jarro woke up to business, and warned them with loud shrieks; but\nin spite of this they flew backward and forward over the shallows\nseveral times. They held themselves so high that they were beyond\nshooting distance; still the farm-hand let himself be tempted to fire a\ncouple of shots at them. These shots were hardly fired before the little\ncreature ran up on land, drew a tiny knife from its sheath, and, with a\ncouple of quick strokes, cut loose Jarro's halter. \"Now fly away, Jarro,\nbefore the man has time to load again!\" cried he, while he himself ran\ndown to the grebe-nest and poled away from the shore.\n\nThe hunter had had his gaze fixed upon the geese, and hadn't observed\nthat Jarro had been freed; but Caesar had followed more carefully that\nwhich happened; and just as Jarro raised his wings, he dashed forward\nand grabbed him by the neck.\n\nJarro cried pitifully; and the boy who had freed him said quietly to\nCaesar: \"If you are just as honourable as you look, surely you cannot\nwish to force a good bird to sit here and entice others into trouble.\"\n\nWhen Caesar heard these words, he grinned viciously with his upper lip,\nbut the next second he dropped Jarro. \"Fly, Jarro!\" said he. \"You are\ncertainly too good to be a decoy-duck. It wasn't for this that I wanted\nto keep you here; but because it will be lonely in the cottage without\nyou.\"\n\nTHE LOWERING OF THE LAKE\n\n_Wednesday, April twentieth_.\n\nIt was indeed very lonely in the cottage without Jarro. The dog and the\ncat found the time long, when they didn't have him to wrangle over; and\nthe housewife missed the glad quacking which he had indulged in every\ntime she entered the house. But the one who longed most for Jarro, was\nthe little boy, Per Ola. He was but three years old, and the only child;\nand in all his life he had never had a playmate like Jarro. When he\nheard that Jarro had gone back to Takern and the wild ducks, he couldn't\nbe satisfied with this, but thought constantly of how he should get him\nback again.\n\nPer Ola had talked a good deal with Jarro while he lay still in his\nbasket, and he was certain that the duck understood him. He begged his\nmother to take him down to the lake that he might find Jarro, and\npersuade him to come back to them. Mother wouldn't listen to this; but\nthe little one didn't give up his plan on that account.\n\nThe day after Jarro had disappeared, Per Ola was running about in the\nyard. He played by himself as usual, but Caesar lay on the stoop; and\nwhen mother let the boy out, she said: \"Take care of Per Ola, Caesar!\"\n\nNow if all had been as usual, Caesar would also have obeyed the command,\nand the boy would have been so well guarded that he couldn't have run\nthe least risk. But Caesar was not like himself these days. He knew that\nthe farmers who lived along Takern had held frequent conferences about\nthe lowering of the lake; and that they had almost settled the matter.\nThe ducks must leave, and Caesar should nevermore behold a glorious\nchase. He was so preoccupied with thoughts of this misfortune, that he\ndid not remember to watch over Per Ola.\n\nAnd the little one had scarcely been alone in the yard a minute, before\nhe realised that now the right moment was come to go down to Takern and\ntalk with Jarro. He opened a gate, and wandered down toward the lake on\nthe narrow path which ran along the banks. As long as he could be seen\nfrom the house, he walked slowly; but afterward he increased his pace.\nHe was very much afraid that mother, or someone else, should call to him\nthat he couldn't go. He didn't wish to do anything naughty, only to\npersuade Jarro to come home; but he felt that those at home would not\nhave approved of the undertaking.\n\nWhen Per Ola came down to the lake-shore, he called Jarro several\ntimes. Thereupon he stood for a long time and waited, but no Jarro\nappeared. He saw several birds that resembled the wild duck, but they\nflew by without noticing him, and he could understand that none among\nthem was the right one.\n\nWhen Jarro didn't come to him, the little boy thought that it would be\neasier to find him if he went out on the lake. There were several good\ncraft lying along the shore, but they were tied. The only one that lay\nloose, and at liberty, was an old leaky scow which was so unfit that no\none thought of using it. But Per Ola scrambled up in it without caring\nthat the whole bottom was filled with water. He had not strength enough\nto use the oars, but instead, he seated himself to swing and rock in the\nscow. Certainly no grown person would have succeeded in moving a scow\nout on Takern in that manner; but when the tide is high--and ill-luck to\nthe fore--little children have a marvellous faculty for getting out to\nsea. Per Ola was soon riding around on Takern, and calling for Jarro.\n\nWhen the old scow was rocked like this--out to sea--its Cracks opened\nwider and wider, and the water actually streamed into it. Per Ola didn't\npay the slightest attention to this. He sat upon the little bench in\nfront and called to every bird he saw, and wondered why Jarro didn't\nappear.\n\nAt last Jarro caught sight of Per Ola. He heard that someone called him\nby the name which he had borne among human beings, and he understood\nthat the boy had gone out on Takern to search for him. Jarro was\nunspeakably happy to find that one of the humans really loved him. He\nshot down toward Per Ola, like an arrow, seated himself beside him, and\nlet him caress him. They were both very happy to see each other again.\nBut suddenly Jarro noticed the condition of the scow. It was half-filled\nwith water, and was almost ready to sink. Jarro tried to tell Per Ola\nthat he, who could neither fly nor swim, must try to get upon land; but\nPer Ola didn't understand him. Then Jarro did not wait an instant, but\nhurried away to get help.\n\nJarro came back in a little while, and carried on his back a tiny thing,\nwho was much smaller than Per Ola himself. If he hadn't been able to\ntalk and move, the boy would have believed that it was a doll.\nInstantly, the little one ordered Per Ola to pick up a long, slender\npole that lay in the bottom of the scow, and try to pole it toward one\nof the reed-islands. Per Ola obeyed him, and he and the tiny creature,\ntogether, steered the scow. With a couple of strokes they were on a\nlittle reed-encircled island, and now Per Ola was told that he must step\non land. And just the very moment that Per Ola set foot on land, the\nscow was filled with water, and sank to the bottom. When Per Ola saw\nthis he was sure that father and mother would be very angry with him. He\nwould have started in to cry if he hadn't found something else to think\nabout soon; namely, a flock of big, gray birds, who lighted on the\nisland. The little midget took him up to them, and told him their names,\nand what they said. And this was so funny that Per Ola forgot\neverything else.\n\nMeanwhile the folks on the farm had discovered that the boy had\ndisappeared, and had started to search for him. They searched the\nouthouses, looked in the well, and hunted through the cellar. Then they\nwent out into the highways and by-paths; wandered to the neighbouring\nfarm to find out if he had strayed over there, and searched for him also\ndown by Takern. But no matter how much they sought they did not find\nhim.\n\nCaesar, the dog, understood very well that the farmer-folk were looking\nfor Per Ola, but he did nothing to lead them on the right track;\ninstead, he lay still as though the matter didn't concern him.\n\nLater in the day, Per Ola's footprints were discovered down by the\nboat-landing. And then came the thought that the old, leaky scow was no\nlonger on the strand. Then one began to understand how the whole affair\nhad come about.\n\nThe farmer and his helpers immediately took out the boats and went in\nsearch of the boy. They rowed around on Takern until way late in the\nevening, without seeing the least shadow of him. They couldn't help\nbelieving that the old scow had gone down, and that the little one lay\ndead on the lake-bottom.\n\nIn the evening, Per Ola's mother hunted around on the strand. Everyone\nelse was convinced that the boy was drowned, but she could not bring\nherself to believe this. She searched all the while. She searched\nbetween reeds and bulrushes; tramped and tramped on the muddy shore,\nnever thinking of how deep her foot sank, and how wet she had become.\nShe was unspeakably desperate. Her heart ached in her breast. She did\nnot weep, but wrung her hands and called for her child in loud piercing\ntones.\n\nRound about her she heard swans' and ducks' and curlews' shrieks. She\nthought that they followed her, and moaned and wailed--they too.\n\"Surely, they, too, must be in trouble, since they moan so,\" thought\nshe. Then she remembered: these were only birds that she heard complain.\nThey surely had no worries.\n\nIt was strange that they did not quiet down after sunset. But she heard\nall these uncountable bird-throngs, which lived along Takern, send forth\ncry upon cry. Several of them followed her wherever she went; others\ncame rustling past on light wings. All the air was filled with moans and\nlamentations.\n\nBut the anguish which she herself was suffering, opened her heart. She\nthought that she was not as far removed from all other living creatures\nas people usually think. She understood much better than ever before,\nhow birds fared. They had their constant worries for home and children;\nthey, as she. There was surely not such a great difference between them\nand her as she had heretofore believed.\n\nThen she happened to think that it was as good as settled that these\nthousands of swans and ducks and loons would lose their homes here by\nTakern. \"It will be very hard for them,\" she thought. \"Where shall they\nbring up their children now?\"\n\nShe stood still and mused on this. It appeared to be an excellent and\nagreeable accomplishment to change a lake into fields and meadows, but\nlet it be some other lake than Takern; some other lake, which was not\nthe home of so many thousand creatures.\n\nShe remembered how on the following day the proposition to lower the\nlake was to be decided, and she wondered if this was why her little son\nhad been lost--just to-day.\n\nWas it God's meaning that sorrow should come and open her heart--just\nto-day--before it was too late to avert the cruel act?\n\nShe walked rapidly up to the house, and began to talk with her husband\nabout this. She spoke of the lake, and of the birds, and said that she\nbelieved it was God's judgment on them both. And she soon found that he\nwas of the same opinion.\n\nThey already owned a large place, but if the lake-draining was carried\ninto effect, such a goodly portion of the lake-bottom would fall to\ntheir share that their property would be nearly doubled. For this reason\nthey had been more eager for the undertaking than any of the other shore\nowners. The others had been worried about expenses, and anxious lest the\ndraining should not prove any more successful this time than it was the\nlast. Per Ola's father knew in his heart that it was he who had\ninfluenced them to undertake the work. He had exercised all his\neloquence, so that he might leave to his son a farm as large again as\nhis father had left to him.\n\nHe stood and pondered if God's hand was back of the fact that Takern had\ntaken his son from him on the day before he was to draw up the contract\nto lay it waste. The wife didn't have to say many words to him, before\nhe answered: \"It may be that God does not want us to interfere with His\norder. I'll talk with the others about this to-morrow, and I think we'll\nconclude that all may remain as it is.\"\n\nWhile the farmer-folk were talking this over, Caesar lay before the\nfire. He raised his head and listened very attentively. When he thought\nthat he was sure of the outcome, he walked up to the mistress, took her\nby the skirt, and led her to the door. \"But Caesar!\" said she, and\nwanted to break loose. \"Do you know where Per Ola is?\" she exclaimed.\nCaesar barked joyfully, and threw himself against the door. She opened\nit, and Caesar dashed down toward Takern. The mistress was so positive\nhe knew where Per Ola was, that she rushed after him. And no sooner had\nthey reached the shore than they heard a child's cry out on the lake.\n\nPer Ola had had the best day of his life, in company with Thumbietot and\nthe birds; but now he had begun to cry because he was hungry and afraid\nof the darkness. And he was glad when father and mother and Caesar came\nfor him.\n\n\nULV\u00c3\u0085SA-LADY\n\n\nTHE PROPHECY\n\n_Friday, April twenty-second_.\n\nOne night when the boy lay and slept on an island in Takern, he was\nawakened by oar-strokes. He had hardly gotten his eyes open before there\nfell such a dazzling light on them that he began to blink.\n\nAt first he couldn't make out what it was that shone so brightly out\nhere on the lake; but he soon saw that a scow with a big burning torch\nstuck up on a spike, aft, lay near the edge of the reeds. The red flame\nfrom the torch was clearly reflected in the night-dark lake; and the\nbrilliant light must have lured the fish, for round about the flame in\nthe deep a mass of dark specks were seen, that moved continually, and\nchanged places.\n\nThere were two old men in the scow. One sat at the oars, and the other\nstood on a bench in the stern and held in his hand a short spear which\nwas coarsely barbed. The one who rowed was apparently a poor fisherman.\nHe was small, dried-up and weather-beaten, and wore a thin, threadbare\ncoat. One could see that he was so used to being out in all sorts of\nweather that he didn't mind the cold. The other was well fed and well\ndressed, and looked like a prosperous and self-complacent farmer.\n\n\"Now, stop!\" said the farmer, when they were opposite the island where\nthe boy lay. At the same time he plunged the spear into the water. When\nhe drew it out again, a long, fine eel came with it.\n\n\"Look at that!\" said he as he released the eel from the spear. \"That was\none who was worth while. Now I think we have so many that we can turn\nback.\"\n\nHis comrade did not lift the oars, but sat and looked around. \"It is\nlovely out here on the lake to-night,\" said he. And so it was. It was\nabsolutely still, so that the entire water-surface lay in undisturbed\nrest with the exception of the streak where the boat had gone forward.\nThis lay like a path of gold, and shimmered in the firelight. The sky\nwas clear and dark blue and thickly studded with stars. The shores were\nhidden by the reed islands except toward the west. There Mount Omberg\nloomed up high and dark, much more impressive than usual, and, cut away\na big, three-cornered piece of the vaulted heavens.\n\nThe other one turned his head to get the light out of his eyes, and\nlooked about him. \"Yes, it is lovely here in \u00c3\u0096stergylln,\" said he.\n\"Still the best thing about the province is not its beauty.\" \"Then what\nis it that's best?\" asked the oarsman. \"That it has always been a\nrespected and honoured province.\" \"That may be true enough.\" \"And then\nthis, that one knows it will always continue to be so.\" \"But how in the\nworld can one know this?\" said the one who sat at the oars.\n\nThe farmer straightened up where he stood and braced himself with the\nspear. \"There is an old story which has been handed down from father to\nson in my family; and in it one learns what will happen to\n\u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland.\" \"Then you may as well tell it to me,\" said the oarsman.\n\"We do not tell it to anyone and everyone, but I do not wish to keep it\na secret from an old comrade.\n\n\"At Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa, here in \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland,\" he continued (and one could tell by\nthe tone of his voice that he talked of something which he had heard\nfrom others, and knew by heart), \"many, many years ago, there lived a\nlady who had the gift of looking into the future, and telling people\nwhat was going to happen to them--just as certainly and accurately as\nthough it had already occurred. For this she became widely noted; and it\nis easy to understand that people would come to her, both from far and\nnear, to find out what they were going to pass through of good or evil.\n\n\"One day, when Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady sat in her hall and spun, as was customary in\nformer days, a poor peasant came into the room and seated himself on the\nbench near the door.\n\n\"'I wonder what you are sitting and thinking about, dear lady,' said the\npeasant after a little.\n\n\"'I am sitting and thinking about high and holy things,' answered she.\n'Then it is not fitting, perhaps, that I ask you about something which\nweighs on my heart,' said the peasant.\n\n\"'It is probably nothing else that weighs on your heart than that you\nmay reap much grain on your field. But I am accustomed to receive\ncommunications from the Emperor about how it will go with his crown; and\nfrom the Pope, about how it will go with his keys.' 'Such things cannot\nbe easy to answer,' said the peasant. 'I have also heard that no one\nseems to go from here without being dissatisfied with what he has\nheard.'\n\n\"When the peasant said this, he saw that Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady bit her lip, and\nmoved higher up on the bench. 'So this is what you have heard about me,'\nsaid she. 'Then you may as well tempt fortune by asking me about the\nthing you wish to know; and you shall see if I can answer so that you\nwill be satisfied.'\n\n\"After this the peasant did not hesitate to state his errand. He said\nthat he had come to ask how it would go with \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland in the future.\nThere was nothing which was so dear to him as his native province, and\nhe felt that he should be happy until his dying day if he could get a\nsatisfactory reply to his query.\n\n\"'Oh! is that all you wish to know,' said the wise lady; 'then I think\nthat you will be content. For here where I now sit, I can tell you that\nit will be like this with \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland: it will always have something to\nboast of ahead of other provinces.'\n\n\"'Yes, that was a good answer, dear lady,' said the peasant, 'and now I\nwould be entirely at peace if I could only comprehend how such a thing\nshould be possible.'\n\n\"'Why should it not be possible?' said Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady. 'Don't you know that\n\u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland is already renowned? Or think you there is any place in\nSweden that can boast of owning, at the same time, two such cloisters as\nthe ones in Alvastra and Vreta, and such a beautiful cathedral as the\none in Link\u00c3\u00b6ping?'\n\n\"'That may be so,' said the peasant. 'But I'm an old man, and I know\nthat people's minds are changeable. I fear that there will come a time\nwhen they won't want to give us any glory, either for Alvastra or Vreta\nor for the cathedral.'\n\n\"'Herein you may be right,' said Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady, 'but you need not doubt\nprophecy on that account. I shall now build up a new cloister on\nVadstena, and that will become the most celebrated in the North. Thither\nboth the high and the lowly shall make pilgrimages, and all shall sing\nthe praises of the province because it has such a holy place within its\nconfines.'\n\n\"The peasant replied that he was right glad to know this. But he also\nknew, of course, that everything was perishable; and he wondered much\nwhat would give distinction to the province, if Vadstena Cloister should\nonce fall into disrepute.\n\n\"'You are not easy to satisfy,' said Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady, 'but surely I can see\nso far ahead that I can tell you, before Vadstena Cloister shall have\nlost its splendour, there will be a castle erected close by, which will\nbe the most magnificent of its period. Kings and dukes will be guests\nthere, and it shall be accounted an honour to the whole province, that\nit owns such an ornament.'\n\n\"'This I am also glad to hear,' said the peasant. 'But I'm an old man,\nand I know how it generally turns out with this world's glories. And if\nthe castle goes to ruin, I wonder much what there will be that can\nattract the people's attention to this province.'\n\n\"'It's not a little that you want to know,' said Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady, 'but,\ncertainly, I can look far enough into the future to see that there will\nbe life and movement in the forests around Finsp\u00c3\u00a5ng. I see how cabins\nand smithies arise there, and I believe that the whole province shall\nbe renowned because iron will be moulded within its confines.'\n\n\"The peasant didn't deny that he was delighted to hear this. 'But if it\nshould go so badly that even Finsp\u00c3\u00a5ng's foundry went down in importance,\nthen it would hardly be possible that any new thing could arise of which\n\u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland might boast.'\n\n\"'You are not easy to please,' said Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady, 'but I can see so far\ninto the future that I mark how, along the lake-shores, great\nmanors--large as castles--are built by gentlemen who have carried on\nwars in foreign lands. I believe that the manors will bring the province\njust as much honour as anything else that I have mentioned.'\n\n\"'But if there comes a time when no one lauds the great manors?'\ninsisted the peasant.\n\n\"'You need not be uneasy at all events,' said Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady. I see how\nhealth-springs bubble on Medevi meadows, by V\u00c3\u00a4tter's shores. I believe\nthat the wells at Medevi will bring the land as much praise as you can\ndesire.'\n\n\"'That is a mighty good thing to know,' said the peasant. 'But if there\ncomes a time when people will seek their health at other springs?'\n\n\"'You must not give yourself any anxiety on that account,' answered\nUlv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady. I see how people dig and labour, from Motala to Mem. They\ndig a canal right through the country, and then \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland's praise is\nagain on everyone's lips.'\n\n\"But, nevertheless, the peasant looked distraught.\n\n\"'I see that the rapids in Motala stream begin to draw wheels,' said\nUlv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady--and now two bright red spots came to her cheeks, for she\nbegan to be impatient--'I hear hammers resound in Motala, and looms\nclatter in Norrk\u00c3\u00b6ping.'\n\n\"'Yes, that's good to know,' said the peasant, 'but everything is\nperishable, and I'm afraid that even this can be forgotten, and go into\noblivion.'\n\n\"When the peasant was not satisfied even now, there was an end to the\nlady's patience. 'You say that everything is perishable,' said she, 'but\nnow I shall still name something which will always be like itself; and\nthat is that such arrogant and pig-headed peasants as you will always\nbe found in this province--until the end of time.'\n\n\"Hardly had Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady said this before the peasant rose--happy and\nsatisfied--and thanked her for a good answer. Now, at last, he was\nsatisfied, he said.\n\n\"'Verily, I understand now how you look at it,' then said Ulv\u00c3\u00a5sa-lady.\n\n\"'Well, I look at it in this way, dear lady,' said the peasant, 'that\neverything which kings and priests and noblemen and merchants build and\naccomplish, can only endure for a few years. But when you tell me that\nin \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland there will always be peasants who are honour-loving and\npersevering, then I know also that it will be able to keep its ancient\nglory. For it is only those who go bent under the eternal labour with\nthe soil, who can hold this land in good repute and honour--from one\ntime to another.'\"\n\n\nTHE HOMESPUN CLOTH\n\n\n_Saturday, April twenty-third_.\n\nThe boy rode forward--way up in the air. He had the great \u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland\nplain under him, and sat and counted the many white churches which\ntowered above the small leafy groves around them. It wasn't long before\nhe had counted fifty. After that he became confused and couldn't keep\ntrack of the counting.\n\nNearly all the farms were built up with large, whitewashed two-story\nhouses, which looked so imposing that the boy couldn't help admiring\nthem. \"There can't be any peasants in this land,\" he said to himself,\n\"since I do not see any peasant farms.\"\n\nImmediately all the wild geese shrieked: \"Here the peasants live like\ngentlemen. Here the peasants live like gentlemen.\"\n\nOn the plains the ice and snow had disappeared, and the spring work had\nbegun. \"What kind of long crabs are those that creep over the fields?\"\nasked the boy after a bit. \"Ploughs and oxen. Ploughs and oxen,\"\nanswered the wild geese.\n\nThe oxen moved so slowly down on the fields, that one could scarcely\nperceive they were in motion, and the geese shouted to them: \"You won't\nget there before next year. You won't get there before next year.\" But\nthe oxen were equal to the occasion. They raised their muzzles in the\nair and bellowed: \"We do more good in an hour than such as you do in a\nwhole lifetime.\"\n\nIn a few places the ploughs were drawn by horses. They went along with\nmuch more eagerness and haste than the oxen; but the geese couldn't keep\nfrom teasing these either. \"Ar'n't you ashamed to be doing ox-duty?\"\ncried the wild geese. \"Ar'n't you ashamed yourselves to be doing lazy\nman's duty?\" the horses neighed back at them.\n\nBut while horses and oxen were at work in the fields, the stable ram\nwalked about in the barnyard. He was newly clipped and touchy, knocked\nover the small boys, chased the shepherd dog into his kennel, and then\nstrutted about as though he alone were lord of the whole place. \"Rammie,\nrammie, what have you done with your wool?\" asked the wild geese, who\nrode by up in the air. \"That I have sent to Drag's woollen mills in\nNorrk\u00c3\u00b6ping,\" replied the ram with a long, drawn-out bleat. \"Rammie,\nrammie, what have you done with your horns?\" asked the geese. But any\nhorns the rammie had never possessed, to his sorrow, and one couldn't\noffer him a greater insult than to ask after them. He ran around a long\ntime, and butted at the air, so furious was he.\n\nOn the country road came a man who drove a flock of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne pigs that were\nnot more than a few weeks old, and were going to be sold up country.\nThey trotted along bravely, as little as they were, and kept close\ntogether--as if they sought protection. \"Nuff, nuff, nuff, we came away\ntoo soon from father and mother. Nuff, nuff, nuff, how will it go with\nus poor children?\" said the little pigs. The wild geese didn't have the\nheart to tease such poor little creatures. \"It will be better for you\nthan you can ever believe,\" they cried as they flew past them.\n\nThe wild geese were never so merry as when they flew over a flat\ncountry. Then they did not hurry themselves, but flew from farm to farm,\nand joked with the tame animals.\n\nAs the boy rode over the plain, he happened to think of a legend which\nhe had heard a long time ago. He didn't remember it exactly, but it was\nsomething about a petticoat--half of which was made of gold-woven\nvelvet, and half of gray homespun cloth. But the one who owned the\npetticoat adorned the homespun cloth with such a lot of pearls and\nprecious stones that it looked richer and more gorgeous than the\ngold-cloth.\n\nHe remembered this about the homespun cloth, as he looked down on\n\u00c3\u0096sterg\u00c3\u00b6tland, because it was made up of a large plain, which lay wedged\nin between two mountainous forest-tracts--one to the north, the other to\nthe south. The two forest-heights lay there, a lovely blue, and\nshimmered in the morning light, as if they were decked with golden\nveils; and the plain, which simply spread out one winter-naked field\nafter another, was, in and of itself, prettier to look upon than gray\nhomespun.\n\nBut the people must have been contented on the plain, because it was\ngenerous and kind, and they had tried to decorate it in the best way\npossible. High up--where the boy rode by--he thought that cities and\nfarms, churches and factories, castles and railway stations were\nscattered over it, like large and small trinkets. It shone on the roofs,\nand the window-panes glittered like jewels. Yellow country roads,\nshining railway-tracks and blue canals ran along between the districts\nlike embroidered loops. Link\u00c3\u00b6ping lay around its cathedral like a\npearl-setting around a precious stone; and the gardens in the country\nwere like little brooches and buttons. There was not much regulation in\nthe pattern, but it was a display of grandeur which one could never tire\nof looking at.\n\nThe geese had left \u00c3\u0096berg district, and travelled toward the east along\nG\u00c3\u00b6ta Canal. This was also getting itself ready for the summer. Workmen\nlaid canal-banks, and tarred the huge lock-gates. They were working\neverywhere to receive spring fittingly, even in the cities. There,\nmasons and painters stood on scaffoldings and made fine the exteriors of\nthe houses while maids were cleaning the windows. Down at the harbour,\nsailboats and steamers were being washed and dressed up.\n\nAt Norrk\u00c3\u00b6ping the wild geese left the plain, and flew up toward\nKolm\u00c3\u00a5rden. For a time they had followed an old, hilly country road,\nwhich wound around cliffs, and ran forward under wild\nmountain-walls--when the boy suddenly let out a shriek. He had been\nsitting and swinging his foot back and forth, and one of his wooden\nshoes had slipped off.\n\n\"Goosey-gander, goosey-gander, I have dropped my shoe!\" cried the boy.\nThe goosey-gander turned about and sank toward the ground; then the boy\nsaw that two children, who were walking along the road, had picked up\nhis shoe. \"Goosey-gander, goosey-gander,\" screamed the boy excitedly,\n\"fly upward again! It is too late. I cannot get my shoe back again.\"\n\nDown on the road stood Osa, the goose-girl, and her brother, little\nMats, looking at a tiny wooden shoe that had fallen from the skies.\n\nOsa, the goose-girl, stood silent a long while, and pondered over the\nfind. At last she said, slowly and thoughtfully: \"Do you remember,\nlittle Mats, that when we went past \u00c3\u0096vid Cloister, we heard that the\nfolks in a farmyard had seen an elf who was dressed in leather breeches,\nand had wooden shoes on his feet, like any other working man? And do you\nrecollect when we came to Vittsk\u00c3\u00b6vle, a girl told us that she had seen a\nGoa-Nisse with wooden shoes, who flew away on the back of a goose? And\nwhen we ourselves came home to our cabin, little Mats, we saw a goblin\nwho was dressed in the same way, and who also straddled the back of a\ngoose--and flew away. Maybe it was the same one who rode along on his\ngoose up here in the air and dropped his wooden shoe.\"\n\n\"Yes, it must have been,\" said little Mats.\n\nThey turned the wooden shoe about and examined it carefully--for it\nisn't every day that one happens across a Goa-Nisse's wooden shoe on the\nhighway.\n\n\"Wait, wait, little Mats!\" said Osa, the goose-girl. \"There is something\nwritten on one side of it.\"\n\n\"Why, so there is! but they are such tiny letters.\"\n\n\"Let me see! It says--it says: 'Nils Holgersson from W. Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g.'\nThat's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard!\" said little Mats.\n\n\nTHE STORY OF KARR AND GRAYSKIN\n\n\nKARR\n\nAbout twelve years before Nils Holgersson started on his travels with\nthe wild geese there was a manufacturer at Kolm\u00c3\u00a5rden who wanted to be\nrid of one of his dogs. He sent for his game-keeper and said to him that\nit was impossible to keep the dog because he could not be broken of the\nhabit of chasing all the sheep and fowl he set eyes on, and he asked the\nman to take the dog into the forest and shoot him.\n\nThe game-keeper slipped the leash on the dog to lead him to a spot in\nthe forest where all the superannuated dogs from the manor were shot and\nburied. He was not a cruel man, but he was very glad to shoot that dog,\nfor he knew that sheep and chickens were not the only creatures he\nhunted. Times without number he had gone into the forest and helped\nhimself to a hare or a grouse-chick.\n\nThe dog was a little black-and-tan setter. His name was Karr, and he was\nso wise he understood all that was said.\n\nAs the game-keeper was leading him through the thickets, Karr knew only\ntoo well what was in store for him. But this no one could have guessed\nby his behaviour, for he neither hung his head nor dragged his tail, but\nseemed as unconcerned as ever.\n\nIt was because they were in the forest that the dog was so careful not\nto appear the least bit anxious.\n\nThere were great stretches of woodland on every side of the factory, and\nthis forest was famed both among animals and human beings because for\nmany, many years the owners had been so careful of it that they had\nbegrudged themselves even the trees needed for firewood. Nor had they\nhad the heart to thin or train them. The trees had been allowed to grow\nas they pleased. Naturally a forest thus protected was a beloved refuge\nfor wild animals, which were to be found there in great numbers. Among\nthemselves they called it Liberty Forest, and regarded it as the best\nretreat in the whole country.\n\nAs the dog was being led through the woods he thought of what a bugaboo\nhe had been to all the small animals and birds that lived there.\n\n\"Now, Karr, wouldn't they be happy in their lairs if they only knew what\nwas awaiting you?\" he thought, but at the same time he wagged his tail\nand barked cheerfully, so that no one should think that he was worried\nor depressed.\n\n\"What fun would there have been in living had I not hunted\noccasionally?\" he reasoned. \"Let him who will, regret; it's not going to\nbe Karr!\"\n\nBut the instant the dog said this, a singular change came over him. He\nstretched his neck as though he had a mind to howl. He no longer trotted\nalongside the game-keeper, but walked behind him. It was plain that he\nhad begun to think of something unpleasant.\n\nIt was early summer; the elk cows had just given birth to their young,\nand, the night before, the dog had succeeded in parting from its mother\nan elk calf not more than five days old, and had driven it down into the\nmarsh. There he had chased it back and forth over the knolls--not with\nthe idea of capturing it, but merely for the sport of seeing how he\ncould scare it. The elk cow knew that the marsh was bottomless so soon\nafter the thaw, and that it could not as yet hold up so large an animal\nas herself, so she stood on the solid earth for the longest time,\nwatching! But when Karr kept chasing the calf farther and farther away,\nshe rushed out on the marsh, drove the dog off, took the calf with her,\nand turned back toward firm land. Elk are more skilled than other\nanimals in traversing dangerous, marshy ground, and it seemed as if she\nwould reach solid land in safety; but when she was almost there a knoll\nwhich she had stepped upon sank into the mire, and she went down with\nit. She tried to rise, but could get no secure foothold, so she sank and\nsank. Karr stood and looked on, not daring to move. When he saw that the\nelk could not save herself, he ran away as fast as he could, for he had\nbegun to think of the beating he would get if it were discovered that he\nhad brought a mother elk to grief. He was so terrified that he dared not\npause for breath until he reached home.\n\nIt was this that the dog recalled; and it troubled him in a way very\ndifferent from the recollection of all his other misdeeds. This was\ndoubtless because he had not really meant to kill either the elk cow or\nher calf, but had deprived them of life without wishing to do so.\n\n\"But maybe they are alive yet!\" thought the dog. \"They were not dead\nwhen I ran away; perhaps they saved themselves.\"\n\nHe was seized with an irresistible longing to know for a certainty while\nyet there was time for him to find out. He noticed that the game-keeper\ndid not have a firm hold on the leash; so he made a sudden spring, broke\nloose, and dashed through the woods down to the marsh with such speed\nthat he was out of sight before the game-keeper had time to level his\ngun.\n\nThere was nothing for the game-keeper to do but to rush after him. When\nhe got to the marsh he found the dog standing upon a knoll, howling with\nall his might.\n\nThe man thought he had better find out the meaning of this, so he\ndropped his gun and crawled out over the marsh on hands and knees. He\nhad not gone far when he saw an elk cow lying dead in the quagmire.\nClose beside her lay a little calf. It was still alive, but so much\nexhausted that it could not move. Karr was standing beside the calf, now\nbending down and licking it, now howling shrilly for help.\n\nThe game-keeper raised the calf and began to drag it toward land. When\nthe dog understood that the calf would be saved he was wild with joy. He\njumped round and round the game-keeper, licking his hands and barking\nwith delight.\n\nThe man carried the baby elk home and shut it up in a calf stall in the\ncow shed. Then he got help to drag the mother elk from the marsh. Only\nafter this had been done did he remember that he was to shoot Karr. He\ncalled the dog to him, and again took him into the forest.\n\nThe game-keeper walked straight on toward the dog's grave; but all the\nwhile he seemed to be thinking deeply. Suddenly he turned and walked\ntoward the manor.\n\nKarr had been trotting along quietly; but when the game-keeper turned\nand started for home, he became anxious. The man must have discovered\nthat it was he that had caused the death of the elk, and now he was\ngoing back to the manor to be thrashed before he was shot!\n\nTo be beaten was worse than all else! With that prospect Karr could no\nlonger keep up his spirits, but hung his head. When he came to the manor\nhe did not look up, but pretended that he knew no one there.\n\nThe master was standing on the stairs leading to the hall when the\ngame-keeper came forward.\n\n\"Where on earth did that dog come from?\" he exclaimed. \"Surely it can't\nbe Karr? He must be dead this long time!\"\n\nThen the man began to tell his master all about the mother elk, while\nKarr made himself as little as he could, and crouched behind the\ngame-keeper's legs.\n\nMuch to his surprise the man had only praise for him. He said it was\nplain the dog knew that the elk were in distress, and wished to save\nthem.\n\n\"You may do as you like, but I can't shoot that dog!\" declared the\ngame-keeper.\n\nKarr raised himself and pricked up his ears. He could hardly believe\nthat he heard aright. Although he did not want to show how anxious he\nhad been, he couldn't help whining a little. Could it be possible that\nhis life was to be spared simply because he had felt uneasy about the\nelk?\n\nThe master thought that Karr had conducted himself well, but as he did\nnot want the dog, he could not decide at once what should be done with\nhim.\n\n\"If you will take charge of him and answer for his good behaviour in the\nfuture, he may as well live,\" he said, finally.\n\nThis the game-keeper was only too glad to do, and that was how Karr came\nto move to the game-keeper's lodge.\n\nGRAYSKIN'S FLIGHT\n\nFrom the day that Karr went to live with the game-keeper he abandoned\nentirely his forbidden chase in the forest. This was due not only to his\nhaving been thoroughly frightened, but also to the fact that he did not\nwish to make the game-keeper angry at him. Ever since his new master\nsaved his life the dog loved him above everything else. He thought only\nof following him and watching over him. If he left the house, Karr would\nrun ahead to make sure that the way was clear, and if he sat at home,\nKarr would lie before the door and keep a close watch on every one who\ncame and went.\n\nWhen all was quiet at the lodge, when no footsteps were heard on the\nroad, and the game-keeper was working in his garden, Karr would amuse\nhimself playing with the baby elk.\n\nAt first the dog had no desire to leave his master even for a moment.\nSince he accompanied him everywhere, he went with him to the cow shed.\nWhen he gave the elk calf its milk, the dog would sit outside the stall\nand gaze at it. The game-keeper called the calf Grayskin because he\nthought it did not merit a prettier name, and Karr agreed with him on\nthat point.\n\nEvery time the dog looked at it he thought that he had never seen\nanything so ugly and misshapen as the baby elk, with its long, shambly\nlegs, which hung down from the body like loose stilts. The head was\nlarge, old, and wrinkled, and it always drooped to one side. The skin\nlay in tucks and folds, as if the animal had put on a coat that had not\nbeen made for him. Always doleful and discontented, curiously enough he\njumped up every time Karr appeared as if glad to see him.\n\nThe elk calf became less hopeful from day to day, did not grow any, and\nat last he could not even rise when he saw Karr. Then the dog jumped up\ninto the crib to greet him, and thereupon a light kindled in the eyes of\nthe poor creature--as if a cherished longing were fulfilled.\n\nAfter that Karr visited the elk calf every day, and spent many hours\nwith him, licking his coat, playing and racing with him, till he taught\nhim a little of everything a forest animal should know.\n\nIt was remarkable that, from the time Karr began to visit the elk calf\nin his stall, the latter seemed more contented, and began to grow. After\nhe was fairly started, he grew so rapidly that in a couple of weeks the\nstall could no longer hold him, and he had to be moved into a grove.\n\nWhen he had been in the grove two months his legs were so long that he\ncould step over the fence whenever he wished. Then the lord of the manor\ngave the game-keeper permission to put up a higher fence and to allow\nhim more space. Here the elk lived for several years, and grew up into a\nstrong and handsome animal. Karr kept him company as often as he could;\nbut now it was no longer through pity, for a great friendship had sprung\nup between the two. The elk was always inclined to be melancholy,\nlistless, and, indifferent, but Karr knew how to make him playful and\nhappy.\n\nGrayskin had lived for five summers on the game-keeper's place, when his\nowner received a letter from a zo\u00c3\u00b6logical garden abroad asking if the\nelk might be purchased.\n\nThe master was pleased with the proposal, the game-keeper was\ndistressed, but had not the power to say no; so it was decided that the\nelk should be sold. Karr soon discovered what was in the air and ran\nover to the elk to have a chat with him. The dog was very much\ndistressed at the thought of losing his friend, but the elk took the\nmatter calmly, and seemed neither glad nor sorry.\n\n\"Do you think of letting them send you away without offering\nresistance?\" asked Karr.\n\n\"What good would it do to resist?\" asked Grayskin. \"I should prefer to\nremain where I am, naturally, but if I've been sold, I shall have to go,\nof course.\"\n\nKarr looked at Grayskin and measured him with his eyes. It was apparent\nthat the elk was not yet full grown. He did not have the broad antlers,\nhigh hump, and long mane of the mature elk; but he certainly had\nstrength enough to fight for his freedom.\n\n\"One can see that he has been in captivity all his life,\" thought Karr,\nbut said nothing.\n\nKarr left and did not return to the grove till long past midnight. By\nthat time he knew Grayskin would be awake and eating his breakfast.\n\n\"Of course you are doing right, Grayskin, in letting them take you\naway,\" remarked Karr, who appeared now to be calm and satisfied. \"You\nwill be a prisoner in a large park and will have no responsibilities. It\nseems a pity that you must leave here without having seen the forest.\nYou know your ancestors have a saying that 'the elk are one with the\nforest.' But you haven't even been in a forest!\"\n\nGrayskin glanced up from the clover which he stood munching.\n\n\"Indeed, I should love to see the forest, but how am I to get over the\nfence?\" he said with his usual apathy.\n\n\"Oh, that is difficult for one who has such short legs!\" said Karr.\n\nThe elk glanced slyly at the dog, who jumped the fence many times a\nday--little as he was.\n\nHe walked over to the fence, and with one spring he was on the other\nside, without knowing how it happened.\n\nThen Karr and Grayskin went into the forest. It was a beautiful\nmoonlight night in late summer; but in among the trees it was dark, and\nthe elk walked along slowly.\n\n\"Perhaps we had better turn back,\" said Karr. \"You, who have never\nbefore tramped the wild forest, might easily break your legs.\" Grayskin\nmoved more rapidly and with more courage.\n\nKarr conducted the elk to a part of the forest where the pines grew so\nthickly that no wind could penetrate them.\n\n\"It is here that your kind are in the habit of seeking shelter from cold\nand storm,\" said Karr. \"Here they stand under the open skies all winter.\nBut you will fare much better where you are going, for you will stand in\na shed, with a roof over your head, like an ox.\"\n\nGrayskin made no comment, but stood quietly and drank in the strong,\npiney air.\n\n\"Have you anything more to show me, or have I now seen the whole\nforest?\" he asked.\n\nThen Karr went with him to a big marsh, and showed him clods and\nquagmire.\n\n\"Over this marsh the elk take flight when they are in peril,\" said Karr.\n\"I don't know how they manage it, but, large and heavy as they are, they\ncan walk here without sinking. Of course you couldn't hold yourself up\non such dangerous ground, but then there is no occasion for you to do\nso, for you will never be hounded by hunters.\"\n\nGrayskin made no retort, but with a leap he was out on the marsh, and\nhappy when he felt how the clods rocked under him. He dashed across the\nmarsh, and came back again to Karr, without having stepped into a\nmudhole.\n\n\"Have we seen the whole forest now?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, not yet,\" said Karr.\n\nHe next conducted the elk to the skirt of the forest, where fine oaks,\nlindens, and aspens grew.\n\n\"Here your kind eat leaves and bark, which they consider the choicest\nof food; but you will probably get better fare abroad.\"\n\nGrayskin was astonished when he saw the enormous leaf-trees spreading\nlike a great canopy above him. He ate both oak leaves and aspen bark.\n\n\"These taste deliciously bitter and good!\" he remarked. \"Better than\nclover!\"\n\n\"Then wasn't it well that you should taste them once?\" said the dog.\n\nThereupon he took the elk down to a little forest lake. The water was as\nsmooth as a mirror, and reflected the shores, which were veiled in thin,\nlight mists. When Grayskin saw the lake he stood entranced.\n\n\"What is this, Karr?\" he asked.\n\nIt was the first time that he had seen a lake.\n\n\"It's a large body of water--a lake,\" said Karr. \"Your people swim\nacross it from shore to shore. One could hardly expect you to be\nfamiliar with this; but at least you should go in and take a swim!\"\n\nKarr, himself, plunged into the water for a swim. Grayskin stayed back\non the shore for some little time, but finally followed. He grew\nbreathless with delight as the cool water stole soothingly around his\nbody. He wanted it over his back, too, so went farther out. Then he felt\nthat the water could hold him up, and began to swim. He swam all around\nKarr, ducking and snorting, perfectly at home in the water.\n\nWhen they were on shore again, the dog asked if they had not better go\nhome now.\n\n\"It's a long time until morning,\" observed Grayskin, \"so we can tramp\naround in the forest a little longer.\"\n\nThey went again into the pine wood. Presently they came to an open glade\nilluminated by the moonlight, where grass and flowers shimmered beneath\nthe dew. Some large animals were grazing on this forest meadow--an elk\nbull, several elk cows and a number of elk calves. When Grayskin caught\nsight of them he stopped short. He hardly glanced at the cows or the\nyoung ones, but stared at the old bull, which had broad antlers with\nmany taglets, a high hump, and a long-haired fur piece hanging down from\nhis throat.\n\n\"What kind of an animal is that?\" asked Grayskin in wonderment.\n\n\"He is called Antler-Crown,\" said Karr, \"and he is your kinsman. One of\nthese days you, too, will have broad antlers, like those, and just such\na mane; and if you were to remain in the forest, very likely you, also,\nwould have a herd to lead.\"\n\n\"If he is my kinsman, I must go closer and have a look at him,\" said\nGrayskin. \"I never dreamed that an animal could be so stately!\"\n\nGrayskin walked over to the elk, but almost immediately he came back to\nKarr, who had remained at the edge of the clearing.\n\n\"You were not very well received, were you?\" said Karr.\n\n\"I told him that this was the first time I had run across any of my\nkinsmen, and asked if I might walk with them on their meadow. But they\ndrove me back, threatening me with their antlers.\"\n\n\"You did right to retreat,\" said Karr. \"A young elk bull with only a\ntaglet crown must be careful about fighting with an old elk. Another\nwould have disgraced his name in the whole forest by retreating without\nresistance, but such things needn't worry you who are going to move to a\nforeign land.\"\n\nKarr had barely finished speaking when Grayskin turned and walked down\nto the meadow. The old elk came toward him, and instantly they began to\nfight. Their antlers met and clashed, and Grayskin was driven backward\nover the whole meadow. Apparently he did not know how to make use of his\nstrength; but when he came to the edge of the forest, he planted his\nfeet on the ground, pushed hard with his antlers, and began to force\nAntler-Crown back.\n\nGrayskin fought quietly, while Antler-Crown puffed and snorted. The old\nelk, in his turn, was now being forced backward over the meadow.\nSuddenly a loud crash was heard! A taglet in the old elk's antlers had\nsnapped. He tore himself loose, and dashed into the forest.\n\nKarr was still standing at the forest border when Grayskin came along.\n\n\"Now that you have seen what there is in the forest,\" said Karr, \"will\nyou come home with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's about time,\" observed the elk.\n\nBoth were silent on the way home. Karr sighed several times, as if he\nwas disappointed about something; but Grayskin stepped along--his head\nin the air--and seemed delighted over the adventure. He walked ahead\nunhesitatingly until they came to the enclosure. There he paused. He\nlooked in at the narrow pen where he had lived up till now; saw the\nbeaten ground, the stale fodder, the little trough where he had drunk\nwater, and the dark shed in which he had slept.\n\n\"The elk are one with the forest!\" he cried. Then he threw back his\nhead, so that his neck rested against his back, and rushed wildly into\nthe woods.\n\nHELPLESS, THE WATER-SNAKE\n\nIn a pine thicket in the heart of Liberty Forest, every year, in the\nmonth of August, there appeared a few grayish-white moths of the kind\nwhich are called nun moths. They were small and few in number, and\nscarcely any one noticed them. When they had fluttered about in the\ndepth of the forest a couple of nights, they laid a few thousand eggs on\nthe branches of trees; and shortly afterward dropped lifeless to the\nground.\n\nWhen spring came, little prickly caterpillars crawled out from the eggs\nand began to eat the pine needles. They had good appetites, but they\nnever seemed to do the trees any serious harm, because they were hotly\npursued by birds. It was seldom that more than a few hundred\ncaterpillars escaped the pursuers.\n\nThe poor things that lived to be full grown crawled up on the branches,\nspun white webs around themselves, and sat for a couple of weeks as\nmotionless pupae. During this period, as a rule, more than half of them\nwere abducted. If a hundred nun moths came forth in August, winged and\nperfect, it was reckoned a good year for them.\n\nThis sort of uncertain and obscure existence did the moths lead for many\nyears in Liberty Forest. There were no insect folk in the whole country\nthat were so scarce, and they would have remained quite harmless and\npowerless had they not, most unexpectedly, received a helper.\n\nThis fact has some connection with Grayskin's flight from the\ngame-keeper's paddock. Grayskin roamed the forest that he might become\nmore familiar with the place. Late in the afternoon he happened to\nsqueeze through some thickets behind a clearing where the soil was muddy\nand slimy, and in the centre of it was a murky pool. This open space was\nencircled by tall pines almost bare from age and miasmic air. Grayskin\nwas displeased with the place and would have left it at once had he not\ncaught sight of some bright green calla leaves which grew near the pool.\n\nAs he bent his head toward the calla stalks, he happened to disturb a\nbig black snake, which lay sleeping under them. Grayskin had heard Karr\nspeak of the poisonous adders that were to be found in the forest. So,\nwhen the snake raised its head, shot out its tongue and hissed at him,\nhe thought he had encountered an awfully dangerous reptile. He was\nterrified and, raising his foot, he struck so hard with his hoof that he\ncrushed the snake's head. Then, away he ran in hot haste!\n\nAs soon as Grayskin had gone, another snake, just as long and as black\nas the first, came up from the pool. It crawled over to the dead one,\nand licked the poor, crushed-in head.\n\n\"Can it be true that you are dead, old Harmless?\" hissed the snake. \"We\ntwo have lived together so many years; we two have been so happy with\neach other, and have fared so well here in the swamp, that we have lived\nto be older than all the other water-snakes in the forest! This is the\nworst sorrow that could have befallen me!\"\n\nThe snake was so broken-hearted that his long body writhed as if it had\nbeen wounded. Even the frogs, who lived in constant fear of him, were\nsorry for him.\n\n\"What a wicked creature he must be to murder a poor water-snake that\ncannot defend itself!\" hissed the snake. \"He certainly deserves a severe\npunishment. As sure as my name is Helpless and I'm the oldest\nwater-snake in the whole forest, I'll be avenged! I shall not rest until\nthat elk lies as dead on the ground as my poor old snake-wife.\"\n\nWhen the snake had made this vow he curled up into a hoop and began to\nponder. One can hardly imagine anything that would be more difficult for\na poor water-snake than to wreak vengeance upon a big, strong elk; and\nold Helpless pondered day and night without finding any solution.\n\nOne night, as he lay there with his vengeance-thoughts, he heard a\nslight rustle over his head. He glanced up and saw a few light nun moths\nplaying in among the trees.\n\nHe followed them with his eyes a long while; then began to hiss loudly\nto himself, apparently pleased with the thought that had occurred to\nhim--then he fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning the water-snake went over to see Crawlie, the adder,\nwho lived in a stony and hilly part of Liberty Forest. He told him all\nabout the death of the old water-snake, and begged that he who could\ndeal such deadly thrusts would undertake the work of vengeance. But\nCrawlie was not exactly disposed to go to war with an elk.\n\n\"If I were to attack an elk,\" said the adder, \"he would instantly kill\nme. Old Harmless is dead and gone, and we can't bring her back to life,\nso why should I rush into danger on her account?\"\n\nWhen the water-snake got this reply he raised his head a whole foot from\nthe ground, and hissed furiously:\n\n\"Vish vash! Vish vash!\" he said. \"It's a pity that you, who have been\nblessed with such weapons of defence, should be so cowardly that you\ndon't dare use them!\"\n\nWhen the adder heard this, he, too, got angry.\n\n\"Crawl away, old Helpless!\" he hissed. \"The poison is in my fangs, but I\nwould rather spare one who is said to be my kinsman.\"\n\nBut the water-snake did not move from the spot, and for a long time the\nsnakes lay there hissing abusive epithets at each other.\n\nWhen Crawlie was so angry that he couldn't hiss, but could only dart his\ntongue out, the water-snake changed the subject, and began to talk in a\nvery different tone.\n\n\"I had still another errand, Crawlie,\" he said, lowering his voice to a\nmild whisper. \"But now I suppose you are so angry that you wouldn't care\nto help me?\"\n\n\"If you don't ask anything foolish of me, I shall certainly be at your\nservice.\"\n\n\"In the pine trees down by the swamp live a moth folk that fly around\nall night.\"\n\n\"I know all about them,\" remarked Crawlie. \"What's up with them now?\"\n\n\"They are the smallest insect family in the forest,\" said Helpless, \"and\nthe most harmless, since the caterpillars content themselves with\ngnawing only pine needles.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Crawlie.\n\n\"I'm afraid those moths will soon be exterminated,\" sighed the\nwater-snake. \"There are so many who pick off the caterpillars in the\nspring.\"\n\nNow Crawlie began to understand that the water-snake wanted the\ncaterpillars for his own purpose, and he answered pleasantly:\n\n\"Do you wish me to say to the owls that they are to leave those pine\ntree worms in peace?\"\n\n\"Yes, it would be well if you who have some authority in the forest\nshould do this,\" said Helpless.\n\n\"I might also drop a good word for the pine needle pickers among the\nthrushes?\" volunteered the adder. \"I will gladly serve you when you do\nnot demand anything unreasonable.\"\n\n\"Now you have given me a good promise, Crawlie,\" said Helpless, \"and I'm\nglad that I came to you.\"\n\nTHE NUN MOTHS\n\nOne morning--several years later--Karr lay asleep on the porch. It was\nin the early summer, the season of light nights, and it was as bright as\nday, although the sun was not yet up. Karr was awakened by some one\ncalling his name.\n\n\"Is it you, Grayskin?\" he asked, for he was accustomed to the elk's\nnightly visits. Again he heard the call; then he recognized Grayskin's\nvoice, and hastened in the direction of the sound.\n\nKarr heard the elk's footfalls in the distance, as he dashed into the\nthickest pine wood, and straight through the brush, following no trodden\npath. Karr could not catch up with him, and he had great difficulty in\neven following the trail. \"Karr, Karri\" came the cry, and the voice was\ncertainly Grayskin's, although it had a ring now which the dog had never\nheard before.\n\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming!\" the dog responded. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Karr, Karr! Don't you see how it falls and falls?\" said Grayskin.\n\nThen Karr noticed that the pine needles kept dropping and dropping from\nthe trees, like a steady fall of rain.\n\n\"Yes, I see how it falls,\" he cried, and ran far into the forest in\nsearch of the elk.\n\nGrayskin kept running through the thickets, while Karr was about to lose\nthe trail again.\n\n\"Karr, Karr!\" roared Grayskin; \"can't you scent that peculiar odour in\nthe forest?\"\n\nKarr stopped and sniffed.\n\nHe had not thought of it before, but now he remarked that the pines sent\nforth a much stronger odour than usual.\n\n\"Yes, I catch the scent,\" he said. He did not stop long enough to find\nout the cause of it, but hurried on after Grayskin.\n\nThe elk ran ahead with such speed that the dog could not catch up with\nhim.\n\n\"Karr, Karr!\" he called; \"can't you hear the crunching on the pines?\"\nNow his tone was so plaintive it would have melted a stone.\n\nKarr paused to listen. He heard a faint but distinct \"tap, tap,\" on the\ntrees. It sounded like the ticking of a watch.\n\n\"Yes, I hear how it ticks,\" cried Karr, and ran no farther. He\nunderstood that the elk did not want him to follow, but to take notice\nof something that was happening in the forest.\n\nKarr was standing beneath the drooping branches of a great pine. He\nlooked carefully at it; the needles moved. He went closer and saw a mass\nof grayish-white caterpillars creeping along the branches, gnawing off\nthe needles. Every branch was covered with them. The crunch, crunch in\nthe trees came from the working of their busy little jaws. Gnawed-off\nneedles fell to the ground in a continuous shower, and from the poor\npines there came such a strong odour that the dog suffered from it.\n\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" wondered Karr. \"It's too bad about\nthe pretty trees! Soon they'll have no beauty left.\"\n\nHe walked from tree to tree, trying with his poor eyesight to see if all\nwas well with them.\n\n\"There's a pine they haven't touched,\" he thought. But they had taken\npossession of it, too. \"And here's a birch--no, this also! The\ngame-keeper will not be pleased with this,\" observed Karr.\n\nHe ran deeper into the thickets, to learn how far the destruction had\nspread. Wherever he went, he heard the same ticking; scented the same\nodour; saw the same needle rain. There was no need of his pausing to\ninvestigate. He understood it all by these signs. The little\ncaterpillars were everywhere. The whole forest was being ravaged by\nthem!\n\nAll of a sudden he came to a tract where there was no odour, and where\nall was still.\n\n\"Here's the end of their domain,\" thought the dog, as he paused and\nglanced about.\n\nBut here it was even worse; for the caterpillars had already done their\nwork, and the trees were needleless. They were like the dead. The only\nthing that covered them was a network of ragged threads, which the\ncaterpillars had spun to use as roads and bridges.\n\nIn there, among the dying trees, Grayskin stood waiting for Karr.\n\nHe was not alone. With him were four old elk--the most respected in the\nforest. Karr knew them: They were Crooked-Back, who was a small elk, but\nhad a larger hump than the others; Antler-Crown, who was the most\ndignified of the elk; Rough-Mane, with the thick coat; and an old\nlong-legged one, who, up till the autumn before, when he got a bullet in\nhis thigh, had been terribly hot-tempered and quarrelsome.\n\n\"What in the world is happening to the forest?\" Karr asked when he came\nup to the elk. They stood with lowered heads, far protruding upper lips,\nand looked puzzled.\n\n\"No one can tell,\" answered Grayskin. \"This insect family used to be the\nleast hurtful of any in the forest, and never before have they done any\ndamage. But these last few years they have been multiplying so fast that\nnow it appears as if the entire forest would be destroyed.\"\n\n\"Yes, it looks bad,\" Karr agreed, \"but I see that the wisest animals in\nthe forest have come together to hold a consultation. Perhaps you have\nalready found some remedy?\"\n\nWhen the dog said this, Crooked-Back solemnly raised his heavy head,\npricked up his long ears, and spoke:\n\n\"We have summoned you hither, Karr, that we may learn if the humans know\nof this desolation.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Karr, \"no human being ever comes thus far into the forest\nwhen it's not hunting time. They know nothing of this misfortune.\"\n\nThen Antler-Crown said:\n\n\"We who have lived long in the forest do not think that we can fight\nthis insect pest all by ourselves.\"\n\n\"After this there will be no peace in the forest!\" put in Rough-Mane.\n\n\"But we can't let the whole Liberty Forest go to rack and ruin!\"\nprotested Big-and-Strong. \"We'll have to consult the humans; there is no\nalternative.\"\n\nKarr understood that the elk had difficulty in expressing what they\nwished to say, and he tried to help them.\n\n\"Perhaps you want me to let the people know the conditions here?\" he\nsuggested.\n\nAll the old elk nodded their heads.\n\n\"It's most unfortunate that we are obliged to ask help of human beings,\nbut we have no choice.\"\n\nA moment later Karr was on his way home. As he ran ahead, deeply\ndistressed over all that he had heard and seen, a big black water-snake\napproached them.\n\n\"Well met in the forest!\" hissed the water-snake.\n\n\"Well met again!\" snarled Karr, and rushed by without stopping.\n\nThe snake turned and tried to catch up to him.\n\n\"Perhaps that creature also, is worried about the forest,\" thought Karr,\nand waited.\n\nImmediately the snake began to talk about the great disaster.\n\n\"There will be an end of peace and quiet in the forest when human beings\nare called hither,\" said the snake.\n\n\"I'm afraid there will,\" the dog agreed; \"but the oldest forest dwellers\nknow what they're about!\" he added.\n\n\"I think I know a better plan,\" said the snake, \"if I can get the reward\nI wish.\"\n\n\"Are you not the one whom every one around here calls old Helpless?\"\nsaid the dog, sneeringly.\n\n\"I'm an old inhabitant of the forest,\" said the snake, \"and I know how\nto get rid of such plagues.\"\n\n\"If you clear the forest of that pest, I feel sure you can have anything\nyou ask for,\" said Karr.\n\nThe snake did not respond to this until he had crawled under a tree\nstump, where he was well protected. Then he said:\n\n\"Tell Grayskin that if he will leave Liberty Forest forever, and go far\nnorth, where no oak tree grows, I will send sickness and death to all\nthe creeping things that gnaw the pines and spruces!\"\n\n\"What's that you say?\" asked Karr, bristling up. \"What harm has Grayskin\never done you?\"\n\n\"He has slain the one whom I loved best,\" the snake declared, \"and I\nwant to be avenged.\"\n\nBefore the snake had finished speaking, Karr made a dash for him; but\nthe reptile lay safely hidden under the tree stump.\n\n\"Stay where you are!\" Karr concluded. \"We'll manage to drive out the\ncaterpillars without your help.\"\n\nTHE BIG WAR OF THE MOTHS\n\nThe following spring, as Karr was dashing through the forest one\nmorning, he heard some one behind him calling: \"Karr! Karr!\"\n\nHe turned and saw an old fox standing outside his lair.\n\n\"You must tell me if the humans are doing anything for the forest,\" said\nthe fox.\n\n\"Yes, you may be sure they are!\" said Karr. \"They are working as hard as\nthey can.\"\n\n\"They have killed off all my kinsfolk, and they'll be killing me next,\"\nprotested the fox. \"But they shall be pardoned for that if only they\nsave the forest.\"\n\nThat year Karr never ran into the woods without some animal's asking if\nthe humans could save the forest. It was not easy for the dog to answer;\nthe people themselves were not certain that they could conquer the\nmoths. But considering how feared and hated old Kolm\u00c3\u00a5rden had always\nbeen, it was remarkable that every day more than a hundred men went\nthere, to work. They cleared away the underbrush. They felled dead\ntrees, lopped off branches from the live ones so that the caterpillars\ncould not easily crawl from tree to tree; they also dug wide trenches\naround the ravaged parts and put up lime-washed fences to keep them out\nof new territory. Then they painted rings of lime around the trunks of\ntrees to prevent the caterpillars leaving those they had already\nstripped. The idea was to force them to remain where they were until\nthey starved to death.\n\nThe people worked with the forest until far into the spring. They were\nhopeful, and could hardly wait for the caterpillars to come out from\ntheir eggs, feeling certain that they had shut them in so effectually\nthat most of them would die of starvation.\n\nBut in the early summer the caterpillars came out, more numerous than\never.\n\nThey were everywhere! They crawled on the country roads, on fences, on\nthe walls of the cabins. They wandered outside the confines of Liberty\nForest to other parts of Kolm\u00c3\u00a5rden.\n\n\"They won't stop till all our forests are destroyed!\" sighed the people,\nwho were in great despair, and could not enter the forest without\nweeping.\n\nKarr was so sick of the sight of all these creeping, gnawing things that\nhe could hardly bear to step outside the door. But one day he felt that\nhe must go and find out how Grayskin was getting on. He took the\nshortest cut to the elk's haunts, and hurried along--his nose close to\nthe earth. When he came to the tree stump where he had met Helpless the\nyear before, the snake was still there, and called to him:\n\n\"Have you told Grayskin what I said to you when last we met?\" asked the\nwater-snake.\n\nKarr only growled and tried to get at him.\n\n\"If you haven't told him, by all means do so!\" insisted the snake. \"You\nmust see that the humans know of no cure for this plague.\"\n\n\"Neither do you!\" retorted the dog, and ran on.\n\nKarr found Grayskin, but the elk was so low-spirited that he scarcely\ngreeted the dog. He began at once to talk of the forest.\n\n\"I don't know what I wouldn't give if this misery were only at an end!\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Now I shall tell you that 'tis said you could save the forest.\" Then\nKarr delivered the water-snake's message.\n\n\"If any one but Helpless had promised this, I should immediately go into\nexile,\" declared the elk. \"But how can a poor water-snake have the power\nto work such a miracle?\"\n\n\"Of course it's only a bluff,\" said Karr. \"Water-snakes always like to\npretend that they know more than other creatures.\"\n\nWhen Karr was ready to go home, Grayskin accompanied him part of the\nway. Presently Karr heard a thrush, perched on a pine top, cry:\n\n\"There goes Grayskin, who has destroyed the forest! There goes Grayskin,\nwho has destroyed the forest!\"\n\nKarr thought that he had not heard correctly, but the next moment a hare\ncame darting across the path. When the hare saw them, he stopped,\nflapped his ears, and screamed:\n\n\"Here comes Grayskin, who has destroyed the forest!\" Then he ran as fast\nas he could.\n\n\"What do they mean by that?\" asked Karr.\n\n\"I really don't know,\" said Grayskin. \"I think that the small forest\nanimals are displeased with me because I was the one who proposed that\nwe should ask help of human beings. When the underbrush was cut down,\nall their lairs and hiding places were destroyed.\"\n\nThey walked on together a while longer, and Karr heard the same cry\ncoming from all directions:\n\n\"There goes Grayskin, who has destroyed the forest!\"\n\nGrayskin pretended not to hear it; but Karr understood why the elk was\nso downhearted.\n\n\"I say, Grayskin, what does the water-snake mean by saying you killed\nthe one he loved best?\"\n\n\"How can I tell?\" said Grayskin. \"You know very well that I never kill\nanything.\"\n\nShortly after that they met the four old elk--Crooked-Back,\nAntler-Crown, Rough-Mane, and Big-and-Strong, who were coming along\nslowly, one after the other.\n\n\"Well met in the forest!\" called Grayskin.\n\n\"Well met in turn!\" answered the elk.\n\n\"We were just looking for you, Grayskin, to consult with you about the\nforest.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" began Crooked-Back, \"we have been informed that a crime\nhas been committed here, and that the whole forest is being destroyed\nbecause the criminal has not been punished.\"\n\n\"What kind of a crime was it?\"\n\n\"Some one killed a harmless creature that he couldn't eat. Such an act\nis accounted a crime in Liberty Forest.\"\n\n\"Who could have done such a cowardly thing?\" wondered Grayskin.\n\n\"They say that an elk did it, and we were just going to ask if you knew\nwho it was.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Grayskin, \"I have never heard of an elk killing a harmless\ncreature.\"\n\nGrayskin parted from the four old elk, and went on with Karr. He was\nsilent and walked with lowered head. They happened to pass Crawlie, the\nadder, who lay on his shelf of rock.\n\n\"There goes Grayskin, who has destroyed the whole forest!\" hissed\nCrawlie, like all the rest.\n\nBy that time Grayskin's patience was exhausted. He walked up to the\nsnake, and raised a forefoot.\n\n\"Do you think of crushing me as you crushed the old water-snake?\" hissed\nCrawlie.\n\n\"Did I kill a water-snake?\" asked Grayskin, astonished.\n\n\"The first day you were in the forest you killed the wife of poor old\nHelpless,\" said Crawlie.\n\nGrayskin turned quickly from the adder, and continued his walk with\nKarr. Suddenly he stopped.\n\n\"Karr, it was I who committed that crime! I killed a harmless creature;\ntherefore it is on my account that the forest is being destroyed.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\" Karr interrupted.\n\n\"You may tell the water-snake, Helpless, that Grayskin goes into exile\nto-night!\"\n\n\"That I shall never tell him!\" protested Karr. \"The Far North is a\ndangerous country for elk.\"\n\n\"Do you think that I wish to remain here, when I have caused a disaster\nlike this?\" protested Grayskin.\n\n\"Don't be rash! Sleep over it before you do anything!\"\n\n\"It was you who taught me that the elk are one with the forest,\" said\nGrayskin, and so saying he parted from Karr.\n\nThe dog went home alone; but this talk with Grayskin troubled him, and\nthe next morning he returned to the forest to seek him, but Grayskin was\nnot to be found, and the dog did not search long for him. He realized\nthat the elk had taken the snake at his word, and had gone into exile.\n\nOn his walk home Karr was too unhappy for words! He could not understand\nwhy Grayskin should allow that wretch of a water-snake to trick him\naway. He had never heard of such folly! \"What power can that old\nHelpless have?\"\n\nAs Karr walked along, his mind full of these thoughts, he happened to\nsee the game-keeper, who stood pointing up at a tree.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" asked a man who stood beside him.\n\n\"Sickness has come among the caterpillars,\" observed the game-keeper.\n\nKarr was astonished, but he was even more angered at the snake's having\nthe power to keep his word. Grayskin would have to stay away a long long\ntime, for, of course, that water-snake would never die.\n\nAt the very height of his grief a thought came to Karr which comforted\nhim a little.\n\n\"Perhaps the water-snake won't live so long, after all!\" he thought.\n\"Surely he cannot always lie protected under a tree root. As soon as he\nhas cleaned out the caterpillars, I know some one who is going to bite\nhis head off!\"\n\nIt was true that an illness had made its appearance among the\ncaterpillars. The first summer it did not spread much. It had only just\nbroken out when it was time for the larvae to turn into pupae. From the\nlatter came millions of moths. They flew around in the trees like a\nblinding snowstorm, and laid countless numbers of eggs. An even greater\ndestruction was prophesied for the following year.\n\nThe destruction came not only to the forest, but also to the\ncaterpillars. The sickness spread quickly from forest to forest. The\nsick caterpillars stopped eating, crawled up to the branches of the\ntrees, and died there.\n\nThere was great rejoicing among the people when they saw them die, but\nthere was even greater rejoicing among the forest animals.\n\nFrom day to day the dog Karr went about with savage glee, thinking of\nthe hour when he might venture to kill Helpless.\n\nBut the caterpillars, meanwhile, had spread over miles of pine woods.\nNot in one summer did the disease reach them all. Many lived to become\npupas and moths.\n\nGrayskin sent messages to his friend Karr by the birds of passage, to\nsay that he was alive and faring well. But the birds told Karr\nconfidentially that on several occasions Grayskin had been pursued by\npoachers, and that only with the greatest difficulty had he escaped.\n\nKarr lived in a state of continual grief, yearning, and anxiety. Yet he\nhad to wait two whole summers more before there was an end of the\ncaterpillars!\n\nKarr no sooner heard the game-keeper say that the forest was out of\ndanger than he started on a hunt for Helpless. But when he was in the\nthick of the forest he made a frightful discovery: He could not hunt any\nmore, he could not run, he could not track his enemy, and he could not\nsee at all!\n\nDuring the long years of waiting, old age had overtaken Karr. He had\ngrown old without having noticed it. He had not the strength even to\nkill a water-snake. He was not able to save his friend Grayskin from his\nenemy.\n\nRETRIBUTION\n\nOne afternoon Akka from Kebnekaise and her flock alighted on the shore\nof a forest lake.\n\nSpring was backward--as it always is in the mountain districts. Ice\ncovered all the lake save a narrow strip next the land. The geese at\nonce plunged into the water to bathe and hunt for food. In the morning\nNils Holgersson had dropped one of his wooden shoes, so he went down by\nthe elms and birches that grew along the shore, to look for something to\nbind around his foot.\n\nThe boy walked quite a distance before he found anything that he could\nuse. He glanced about nervously, for he did not fancy being in the\nforest.\n\n\"Give me the plains and the lakes!\" he thought. \"There you can see what\nyou are likely to meet. Now, if this were a grove of little birches, it\nwould be well enough, for then the ground would be almost bare; but how\npeople can like these wild, pathless forests is incomprehensible to me.\nIf I owned this land I would chop down every tree.\"\n\nAt last he caught sight of a piece of birch bark, and just as he was\nfitting it to his foot he heard a rustle behind him. He turned quickly.\nA snake darted from the brush straight toward him!\n\nThe snake was uncommonly long and thick, but the boy soon saw that it\nhad a white spot on each cheek.\n\n\"Why, it's only a water-snake,\" he laughed; \"it can't harm me.\"\n\nBut the next instant the snake gave him a powerful blow on the chest\nthat knocked him down. The boy was on his feet in a second and running\naway, but the snake was after him! The ground was stony and scrubby; the\nboy could not proceed very fast; and the snake was close at his heels.\n\nThen the boy saw a big rock in front of him, and began to scale it.\n\n\"I do hope the snake can't follow me here!\" he thought, but he had no\nsooner reached the top of the rock than he saw that the snake was\nfollowing him.\n\nQuite close to the boy, on a narrow ledge at the top of the rock, lay a\nround stone as large as a man's head. As the snake came closer, the boy\nran behind the stone, and gave it a push. It rolled right down on the\nsnake, drawing it along to the ground, where it landed on its head.\n\n\"That stone did its work well!\" thought the boy with a sigh of relief,\nas he saw the snake squirm a little, and then lie perfectly still.\n\n\"I don't think I've been in greater peril on the whole journey,\" he\nsaid.\n\nHe had hardly recovered from the shock when he heard a rustle above him,\nand saw a bird circling through the air to light on the ground right\nbeside the snake. The bird was like a crow in size and form, but was\ndressed in a pretty coat of shiny black feathers.\n\nThe boy cautiously retreated into a crevice of the rock. His adventure\nin being kidnapped by crows was still fresh in his memory, and he did\nnot care to show himself when there was no need of it.\n\nThe bird strode back and forth beside the snake's body, and turned it\nover with his beak. Finally he spread his wings and began to shriek in\near-splitting tones:\n\n\"It is certainly Helpless, the water-snake, that lies dead here!\" Once\nmore he walked the length of the snake; then he stood in a deep study,\nand scratched his neck with his foot.\n\n\"It isn't possible that there can be two such big snakes in the forest,\"\nhe pondered. \"It must surely be Helpless!\"\n\nHe was just going to thrust his beak into the snake, but suddenly\nchecked himself.\n\n\"You mustn't be a numbskull, Bataki!\" he remarked to himself. \"Surely\nyou cannot be thinking of eating the snake until you have called Karr!\nHe wouldn't believe that Helpless was dead unless he could see it with\nhis own eyes.\"\n\nThe boy tried to keep quiet, but the bird was so ludicrously solemn, as\nhe stalked back and forth chattering to himself, that he had to laugh.\n\nThe bird heard him, and, with a flap of his wings, he was up on the\nrock. The boy rose quickly and walked toward him.\n\n\"Are you not the one who is called Bataki, the raven? and are you not a\nfriend of Akka from Kebnekaise?\" asked the boy.\n\nThe bird regarded him intently; then nodded three times.\n\n\"Surely, you're not the little chap who flies around with the wild\ngeese, and whom they call Thumbietot?\"\n\n\"Oh, you're not so far out of the way,\" said the boy.\n\n\"What luck that I should have run across you! Perhaps you can tell me\nwho killed this water-snake?\"\n\n\"The stone which I rolled down on him killed him,\" replied the boy, and\nrelated how the whole thing happened.\n\n\"That was cleverly done for one who is as tiny as you are!\" said the\nraven. \"I have a friend in these parts who will be glad to know that\nthis snake has been killed, and I should like to render you a service in\nreturn.\"\n\n\"Then tell me why you are glad the water-snake is dead,\" responded the\nboy.\n\n\"It's a long story,\" said the raven; \"you wouldn't have the patience to\nlisten to it.\"\n\nBut the boy insisted that he had, and then the raven told him the whole\nstory about Karr and Grayskin and Helpless, the water-snake. When he had\nfinished, the boy sat quietly for a moment, looking straight ahead. Then\nhe spoke:\n\n\"I seem to like the forest better since hearing this. I wonder if there\nis anything left of the old Liberty Forest.\"\n\n\"Most of it has been destroyed,\" said Bataki. \"The trees look as if they\nhad passed through a fire. They'll have to be cleared away, and it will\ntake many years before the forest will be what it once was.\"\n\n\"That snake deserved his death!\" declared the boy. \"But I wonder if it\ncould be possible that he was so wise he could send sickness to the\ncaterpillars?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he knew that they frequently became sick in that way,\"\nintimated Bataki.\n\n\"Yes, that may be; but all the same, I must say that he was a very wily\nsnake.\"\n\nThe boy stopped talking because he saw the raven was not listening to\nhim, but sitting with gaze averted. \"Hark!\" he said. \"Karr is in the\nvicinity. Won't he be happy when he sees that Helpless is dead!\"\n\nThe boy turned his head in the direction of the sound.\n\n\"He's talking with the wild geese,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, you may be sure that he has dragged himself down to the strand to\nget the latest news about Grayskin!\"\n\nBoth the boy and the raven jumped to the ground, and hastened down to\nthe shore. All the geese had come out of the lake, and stood talking\nwith an old dog, who was so weak and decrepit that it seemed as if he\nmight drop dead at any moment.\n\n\"There's Karr,\" said Bataki to the boy. \"Let him hear first what the\nwild geese have to say to him; later we shall tell him that the\nwater-snake is dead.\"\n\nPresently they heard Akka talking to Karr.\n\n\"It happened last year while we were making our usual spring trip,\"\nremarked the leader-goose. \"We started out one morning--Yksi, Kaksi, and\nI, and we flew over the great boundary forests between Dalecarlia and\nH\u00c3\u00a4lsingland. Under us we, saw only thick pine forests. The snow was\nstill deep among the trees, and the creeks were mostly frozen.\n\n\"Suddenly we noticed three poachers down in the forest! They were on\nskis, had dogs in leash, carried knives in their belts, but had no guns.\n\n\"As there was a hard crust on the snow, they did not bother to take the\nwinding forest paths, but skied straight ahead. Apparently they knew\nvery well where they must go to find what they were seeking.\n\n\"We wild geese flew on, high up in the air, so that the whole forest\nunder us was visible. When we sighted the poachers we wanted to find out\nwhere the game was, so we circled up and down, peering through the\ntrees. Then, in a dense thicket, we saw something that looked like big,\nmoss-covered rocks, but couldn't be rocks, for there was no snow on\nthem.\n\n\"We shot down, suddenly, and lit in the centre of the thicket. The three\nrocks moved. They were three elk--a bull and two cows--resting in the\nbleak forest.\n\n\"When we alighted, the elk bull rose and came toward us. He was the\nmost superb animal we had ever seen. When he saw that it was only some\npoor wild geese that had awakened him, he lay down again.\n\n\"'No, old granddaddy, you mustn't go back to sleep!' I cried. 'Flee as\nfast as you can! There are poachers in the forest, and they are bound\nfor this very deer fold.'\n\n\"'Thank you, goose mother!' said the elk. He seemed to be dropping to\nsleep while he was speaking. 'But surely you must know that we elk are\nunder the protection of the law at this time of the year. Those poachers\nare probably out for fox,' he yawned.\n\n\"'There are plenty of fox trails in the forest, but the poachers are not\nlooking for them. Believe me, old granddaddy! They know that you are\nlying here, and are coming to attack you. They have no guns with\nthem--only spears and knives--for they dare not fire a shot at this\nseason.'\n\n\"The elk bull lay there calmly, but the elk cows seemed to feel uneasy.\n\n\"'It may be as the geese say,' they remarked, beginning to bestir\nthemselves.\n\n\"'You just lie down!' said the elk bull. 'There are no poachers coming\nhere; of that you may be certain.'\n\n\"There was nothing more to be done, so we wild geese rose again into the\nair. But we continued to circle over the place, to see how it would turn\nout for the elk.\n\n\"We had hardly reached our regular flying altitude, when we saw the elk\nbull come out from the thicket. He sniffed the air a little, then walked\nstraight toward the poachers. As he strode along he stepped upon dry\ntwigs that crackled noisily. A big barren marsh lay just beyond him.\nThither he went and took his stand in the middle, where there was\nnothing to hide him from view.\n\n\"There he stood until the poachers emerged from the woods. Then he\nturned and fled in the opposite direction. The poachers let loose the\ndogs, and they themselves skied after him at full speed.\n\n\"The elk threw back his head and loped as fast as he could. He kicked up\nsnow until it flew like a blizzard about him. Both dogs and men were\nleft far behind. Then the elk stopped, as if to await their approach.\nWhen they were within sight he dashed ahead again. We understood that he\nwas purposely tempting the hunters away from the place where the cows\nwere. We thought it brave of him to face danger himself, in order that\nthose who were dear to him might be left in safety. None of us wanted to\nleave the place until we had seen how all this was to end.\n\n\"Thus the chase continued for two hours or more. We wondered that the\npoachers went to the trouble of pursuing the elk when they were not\narmed with rifles. They couldn't have thought that they could succeed in\ntiring out a runner like him!\n\n\"Then we noticed that the elk no longer ran so rapidly. He stepped on\nthe snow more carefully, and every time he lifted his feet, blood could\nbe seen in his tracks.\n\n\"We understood why the poachers had been so persistent! They had\ncounted on help from the snow. The elk was heavy, and with every step he\nsank to the bottom of the drift. The hard crust on the snow was scraping\nhis legs. It scraped away the fur, and tore out pieces of flesh, so that\nhe was in torture every time he put his foot down.\n\n\"The poachers and the dogs, who were so light that the ice crust could\nhold their weight, pursued him all the while. He ran on and on--his\nsteps becoming more and more uncertain and faltering. He gasped for\nbreath. Not only did he suffer intense pain, but he was also exhausted\nfrom wading through the deep snowdrifts.\n\n\"At last he lost all patience. He paused to let poachers and dogs come\nupon him, and was ready to fight them. As he stood there waiting, he\nglanced upward. When he saw us wild geese circling above him, he cried\nout:\n\n\"'Stay here, wild geese, until all is over! And the next time you fly\nover Kolm\u00c3\u00a5rden, look up Karr, and ask him if he doesn't think that his\nfriend Grayskin has met with a happy end?'\"\n\nWhen Akka had gone so far in her story the old dog rose and walked\nnearer to her.\n\n\"Grayskin led a good life,\" he said. \"He understands me. He knows that\nI'm a brave dog, and that I shall be glad to hear that he had a happy\nend. Now tell me how--\"\n\nHe raised his tail and threw back his head, as if to give himself a bold\nand proud bearing--then he collapsed.\n\n\"Karr! Karr!\" called a man's voice from the forest.\n\nThe old dog rose obediently.\n\n\"My master is calling me,\" he said, \"and I must not tarry longer. I just\nsaw him load his gun. Now we two are going into the forest for the last\ntime.\n\n\"Many thanks, wild goose! I know everything that I need know to die\ncontent!\"\n\n\nTHE WIND WITCH\n\n\nIN N\u00c3\u0084RKE\n\nIn bygone days there was something in N\u00c3\u00a4rke the like of which was not to\nbe found elsewhere: it was a witch, named Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa.\n\nThe name Kaisa had been given her because she had a good deal to do with\nwind and storm--and these wind witches are always so called. The surname\nwas added because she was supposed to have come from Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter swamp in\nAsker parish.\n\nIt seemed as though her real abode must have been at Asker; but she used\nalso to appear at other places. Nowhere in all N\u00c3\u00a4rke could one be sure\nof not meeting her.\n\nShe was no dark, mournful witch, but gay and frolicsome; and what she\nloved most of all was a gale of wind. As soon as there was wind enough,\noff she would fly to the N\u00c3\u00a4rke plain for a good dance. On days when a\nwhirlwind swept the plain, Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa had fun! She would stand right\nin the wind and spin round, her long hair flying up among the clouds and\nthe long trail of her robe sweeping the ground, like a dust cloud, while\nthe whole plain lay spread out under her, like a ballroom floor.\n\nOf a morning Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa would sit up in some tall pine at the top of\na precipice, and look across the plain. If it happened to be winter and\nshe saw many teams on the roads she hurriedly blew up a blizzard, piling\nthe drifts so high that people could barely get back to their homes by\nevening. If it chanced to be summer and good harvest weather,\nYs\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa would sit quietly until the first hayricks had been\nloaded, then down she would come with a couple of heavy showers, which\nput an end to the work for that day.\n\nIt was only too true that she seldom thought of anything else than\nraising mischief. The charcoal burners up in the Kil mountains hardly\ndared take a cat-nap, for as soon as she saw an unwatched kiln, she\nstole up and blew on it until it began to burn in a great flame. If the\nmetal drivers from Lax\u00c3\u00a5 and Svart\u00c3\u00a5 were out late of an evening,\nYs\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa would veil the roads and the country round about in such\ndark clouds that both men and horses lost their way and drove the heavy\ntrucks down into swamps and morasses.\n\nIf, on a summer's day, the dean's wife at Glanshammar had spread the tea\ntable in the garden and along would come a gust of wind that lifted the\ncloth from the table and turned over cups and saucers, they knew who had\nraised the mischief! If the mayor of \u00c3\u0096rebro's hat blew off, so that he\nhad to run across the whole square after it; if the wash on the line\nblew away and got covered with dirt, or if the smoke poured into the\ncabins and seemed unable to find its way out through the chimney, it was\neasy enough to guess who was out making merry!\n\nAlthough Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa was fond of all sorts of tantalizing games, there\nwas nothing really bad about her. One could see that she was hardest on\nthose who were quarrelsome, stingy, or wicked; while honest folk and\npoor little children she would take under her wing. Old people say of\nher that, once, when Asker church was burning, Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa swept\nthrough the air, lit amid fire and smoke on the church roof, and averted\nthe disaster.\n\nAll the same the N\u00c3\u00a4rke folk were often rather tired of Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa,\nbut she never tired of playing her tricks on them. As she sat on the\nedge of a cloud and looked down upon N\u00c3\u00a4rke, which rested so peacefully\nand comfortably beneath her, she must have thought: \"The inhabitants\nwould fare much too well if I were not in existence. They would grow\nsleepy and dull. There must be some one like myself to rouse them and\nkeep them in good spirits.\"\n\nThen she would laugh wildly and, chattering like a magpie, would rush\noff, dancing and spinning from one end of the plain to the other. When a\nN\u00c3\u00a4rke man saw her come dragging her dust trail over the plain, he could\nnot help smiling. Provoking and tiresome she certainly was, but she had\na merry spirit. It was just as refreshing for the peasants to meet\nYs\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa as it was for the plain to be lashed by the windstorm.\n\nNowadays 'tis said that Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa is dead and gone, like all other\nwitches, but this one can hardly believe. It is as if some one were to\ncome and tell you that henceforth the air would always be still on the\nplain, and the wind would never more dance across it with blustering\nbreezes and drenching showers.\n\nHe who fancies that Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa is dead and gone may as well hear what\noccurred in N\u00c3\u00a4rke the year that Nils Holgersson travelled over that part\nof the country. Then let him tell what he thinks about it.\n\nMARKET EVE\n\n_Wednesday, April twenty-seventh_.\n\nIt was the day before the big Cattle Fair at \u00c3\u0096rebro; it rained in\ntorrents and people thought: \"This is exactly as in Ys\u00c3\u00a4tter-Kaisa's\ntime! At fairs she used to be more prankish than usual. It was quite in\nher line to arrange a downpour like this on a market eve.\"\n\nAs the day wore on, the rain increased, and toward evening came regular\ncloud-bursts. The roads were like bottomless swamps. The farmers who had\nstarted from home with their cattle early in the morning, that they\nmight arrive at a seasonable hour, fared badly. Cows and oxen were so\ntired they could hardly move, and many of the poor beasts dropped down\nin the middle of the road, to show that they were too exhausted to go\nany farther. All who lived along the roadside had to open their doors to\nthe market-bound travellers, and harbour them as best they could. Farm\nhouses, barns, and sheds were soon crowded to their limit.\n\nMeanwhile, those who could struggle along toward the inn did so; but\nwhen they arrived they wished they had stopped at some cabin along the\nroad. All the cribs in the barn and all the stalls in the stable were\nalready occupied. There was no other choice than to let horses and\ncattle stand out in the rain. Their masters could barely manage to get\nunder cover.\n\nThe crush and mud and slush in the barn yard were frightful! Some of the\nanimals were standing in puddles and could not even lie down. There were\nthoughtful masters, of course, who procured straw for their animals to\nlie on, and spread blankets over them; but there were those, also, who\nsat in the inn, drinking and gambling, entirely forgetful of the dumb\ncreatures which they should have protected.\n\nThe boy and the wild geese had come to a little wooded island in Hj\u00c3\u00a4lmar\nLake that evening. The island was separated from the main land by a\nnarrow and shallow stream, and at low tide one could pass over it\ndry-shod.\n\nIt rained just as hard on the island as it did everywhere else. The boy\ncould not sleep for the water that kept dripping down on him. Finally he\ngot up and began to walk. He fancied that he felt the rain less when he\nmoved about.\n\nHe had hardly circled the island, when he heard a splashing in the\nstream. Presently he saw a solitary horse tramping among the trees.\nNever in all his life had he seen such a wreck of a horse! He was\nbroken-winded and stiff-kneed and so thin that every rib could be seen\nunder the hide. He bore neither harness nor saddle--only an old bridle,\nfrom which dangled a half-rotted rope-end. Obviously he had had no\ndifficulty in breaking loose.\n\nThe horse walked straight toward the spot where the wild geese were\nsleeping. The boy was afraid that he would step on them.\n\n\"Where are you going? Feel your ground!\" shouted the boy.\n\n\"Oh, there you are!\" exclaimed the horse. \"I've walked miles to meet\nyou!\"\n\n\"Have you heard of me?\" asked the boy, astonished.\n\n\"I've got ears, even if I am old! There are many who talk of you\nnowadays.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the horse bent his head that he might see better, and the\nboy noticed that he had a small head, beautiful eyes, and a soft,\nsensitive nose.\n\n\"He must have been a good horse at the start, though he has come to\ngrief in his old age,\" he thought.\n\n\"I wish you would come with me and help me with something,\" pleaded the\nhorse.\n\nThe boy thought it would be embarrassing to accompany a creature who\nlooked so wretched, and excused himself on account of the bad weather.\n\n\"You'll be no worse off on my back than you are lying here,\" said the\nhorse. \"But perhaps you don't dare to go with an old tramp of a horse\nlike me.\"\n\n\"Certainly I dare!\" said the boy.\n\n\"Then wake the geese, so that we can arrange with them where they shall\ncome for you to-morrow,\" said the horse.\n\nThe boy was soon seated on the animal's back. The old nag trotted along\nbetter than he had thought possible. It was a long ride in the rain and\ndarkness before they halted near a large inn, where everything looked\nterribly uninviting! The wheel tracks were so deep in the road that the\nboy feared he might drown should he fall down into them. Alongside the\nfence, which enclosed the yard, some thirty or forty horses and cattle\nwere tied, with no protection against the rain, and in the yard were\nwagons piled with packing cases, where sheep, calves, hogs, and chickens\nwere shut in.\n\nThe horse walked over to the fence and stationed himself. The boy\nremained seated upon his back, and, with his good night eyes, plainly\nsaw how badly the animals fared.\n\n\"How do you happen to be standing out here in the rain?\" he asked.\n\n\"We're on our way to a fair at \u00c3\u0096rebro, but we were obliged to put up\nhere on account of the rain. This is an inn; but so many travellers have\nalready arrived that there's no room for us in the barns.\"\n\nThe boy made no reply, but sat quietly looking about him. Not many of\nthe animals were asleep, and on all sides he heard complaints and\nindignant protests. They had reason enough for grumbling, for the\nweather was even worse than it had been earlier in the day. A freezing\nwind had begun to blow, and the rain which came beating down on them\nwas turning to snow. It was easy enough to understand what the horse\nwanted the boy to help him with.\n\n\"Do you see that fine farm yard directly opposite the inn?\" remarked the\nhorse.\n\n\"Yes, I see it,\" answered the boy, \"and I can't comprehend why they\nhaven't tried to find shelter for all of you in there. They are already\nfull, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No, there are no strangers in that place,\" said the horse. \"The people\nwho live on that farm are so stingy and selfish that it would be useless\nfor any one to ask them for harbour.\"\n\n\"If that's the case, I suppose you'll have to stand where you are.\"\n\n\"I was born and raised on that farm,\" said the horse; \"I know that there\nis a large barn and a big cow shed, with many empty stalls and mangers,\nand I was wondering if you couldn't manage in some way or other to get\nus in over there.\"\n\n\"I don't think I could venture--\" hesitated the boy. But he felt so\nsorry for the poor beasts that he wanted at least to try.\n\nHe ran into the strange barn yard and saw at once that all the outhouses\nwere locked and the keys gone. He stood there, puzzled and helpless,\nwhen aid came to him from an unexpected source. A gust of wind came\nsweeping along with terrific force and flung open a shed door right in\nfront of him.\n\nThe boy was not long in getting back to the horse.\n\n\"It isn't possible to get into the barn or the cow house,\" he said, \"but\nthere's a big, empty hay shed that they have forgotten to bolt. I can\nlead you into that.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said the horse. \"It will seem good to sleep once more on\nfamiliar ground. It's the only happiness I can expect in this life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at the flourishing farm opposite the inn, the family sat up\nmuch later than usual that evening.\n\nThe master of the place was a man of thirty-five, tall and dignified,\nwith a handsome but melancholy face. During the day he had been out in\nthe rain and had got wet, like every one else, and at supper he asked\nhis old mother, who was still mistress of the place, to light a fire on\nthe hearth that he might dry his clothes. The mother kindled a feeble\nblaze--for in that house they were not wasteful with wood--and the\nmaster hung his coat on the back of a chair, and placed it before the\nfire. With one foot on top of the andiron and a hand resting on his\nknee, he stood gazing into the embers. Thus he stood for two whole\nhours, making no move other than to cast a log on the fire now and then.\n\nThe mistress removed the supper things and turned down his bed for the\nnight before she went to her own room and seated herself. At intervals\nshe came to the door and looked wonderingly at her son.\n\n\"It's nothing, mother. I'm only thinking,\" he said.\n\nHis thoughts were on something that had occurred shortly before: When he\npassed the inn a horse dealer had asked him if he would not like to\npurchase a horse, and had shown him an old nag so weather-beaten that he\nasked the dealer if he took him for a fool, since he wished to palm off\nsuch a played-out beast on him.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said the horse dealer. \"I only thought that, inasmuch as the\nhorse once belonged to you, you might wish to give him a comfortable\nhome in his old age; he has need of it.\"\n\nThen he looked at the horse and recognized it as one which he himself\nhad raised and broken in; but it did not occur to him to purchase such\nan old and useless creature on that account. No, indeed! He was not one\nwho squandered his money.\n\nAll the same, the sight of the horse had awakened many, memories--and it\nwas the memories that kept him awake.\n\nThat horse had been a fine animal. His father had let him tend it from\nthe start. He had broken it in and had loved it above everything else.\nHis father had complained that he used to feed it too well, and often he\nhad been obliged to steal out and smuggle oats to it.\n\nOnce, when he ventured to talk with his father about letting him buy a\nbroadcloth suit, or having the cart painted, his father stood as if\npetrified, and he thought the old man would have a stroke. He tried to\nmake his father understand that, when he had a fine horse to drive, he\nshould look presentable himself.\n\nThe father made no reply, but two days later he took the horse to \u00c3\u0096rebro\nand sold it.\n\nIt was cruel of him. But it was plain that his father had feared that\nthis horse might lead him into vanity and extravagance. And now, so long\nafterward, he had to admit that his father was right. A horse like that\nsurely would have been a temptation. At first he had grieved terribly\nover his loss. Many a time he had gone down to \u00c3\u0096rebro, just to stand on\na street corner and see the horse pass by, or to steal into the stable\nand give him a lump of sugar. He thought: \"If I ever get the farm, the\nfirst thing I do will be to buy back my horse.\"\n\nNow his father was gone and he himself had been master for two years,\nbut he had not made a move toward buying the horse. He had not thought\nof him for ever so long, until to-night.\n\nIt was strange that he should have forgotten the beast so entirely!\n\nHis father had been a very headstrong, domineering man. When his son was\ngrown and the two had worked together, the father had gained absolute\npower over him. The boy had come to think that everything his father did\nwas right, and, after he became the master, he only tried to do exactly\nas his father would have done.\n\nHe knew, of course, that folk said his father was stingy; but it was\nwell to keep a tight hold on one's purse and not throw away money\nneedlessly. The goods one has received should not be wasted. It was\nbetter to live on a debt-free place and be called stingy, than to carry\nheavy mortgages, like other farm owners.\n\nHe had gone so far in his mind when he was called back by a strange\nsound. It was as if a shrill, mocking voice were repeating his thoughts:\n\"It's better to keep a firm hold on one's purse and be called stingy,\nthan to be in debt, like other farm owners.\"\n\nIt sounded as if some one was trying to make sport of his wisdom and he\nwas about to lose his temper, when he realized that it was all a\nmistake. The wind was beginning to rage, and he had been standing there\ngetting so sleepy that he mistook the howling of the wind in the chimney\nfor human speech.\n\nHe glanced up at the wall clock, which just then struck eleven.\n\n\"It's time that you were in bed,\" he remarked to himself. Then he\nremembered that he had not yet gone the rounds of the farm yard, as it\nwas his custom to do every night, to make sure that all doors were\nclosed and all lights extinguished. This was something he had never\nneglected since he became master. He drew on his coat and went out in\nthe storm.\n\nHe found everything as it should be, save that the door to the empty hay\nshed had been blown open by the wind. He stepped inside for the key,\nlocked the shed door and put the key into his coat pocket. Then he went\nback to the house, removed his coat, and hung it before the fire. Even\nnow he did not retire, but began pacing the floor. The storm without,\nwith its biting wind and snow-blended rain, was terrible, and his old\nhorse was standing in this storm without so much as a blanket to protect\nhim! He should at least have given his old friend a roof over his head,\nsince he had come such a long distance.\n\nAt the inn across the way the boy heard an old wall clock strike eleven\ntimes. Just then he was untying the animals to lead them to the shed in\nthe farm yard opposite. It took some time to rouse them and get them\ninto line. When all were ready, they marched in a long procession into\nthe stingy farmer's yard, with the boy as their guide. While the boy had\nbeen assembling them, the farmer had gone the rounds of the farm yard\nand locked the hay shed, so that when the animals came along the door\nwas closed. The boy stood there dismayed. He could not let the creatures\nstand out there! He must go into the house and find the key.\n\n\"Keep them quiet out here while I go in and fetch the key!\" he said to\nthe old horse, and off he ran.\n\nOn the path right in front of the house he paused to think out how he\nshould get inside. As he stood there he noticed two little wanderers\ncoming down the road, who stopped before the inn.\n\nThe boy saw at once that they were two little girls, and ran toward\nthem.\n\n\"Come now, Britta Maja!\" said one, \"you mustn't cry any more. Now we are\nat the inn. Here they will surely take us in.\"\n\nThe girl had but just said this when the boy called to her:\n\n\"No, you mustn't try to get in there. It is simply impossible. But at\nthe farm house opposite there are no guests. Go there instead.\"\n\nThe little girls heard the words distinctly, though they could not see\nthe one who spoke to them. They did not wonder much at that, however,\nfor the night was as black as pitch. The larger of the girls promptly\nanswered:\n\n\"We don't care to enter that place, because those who live there are\nstingy and cruel. It is their fault that we two must go out on the\nhighways and beg.\"\n\n\"That may be so,\" said the boy, \"but all the same you should go there.\nYou shall see that it will be well for you.\"\n\n\"We can try, but it is doubtful that they will even let us enter,\"\nobserved the two little girls as they walked up to the house and\nknocked.\n\nThe master was standing by the fire thinking of the horse when he heard\nthe knocking. He stepped to the door to see what was up, thinking all\nthe while that he would not let himself be tempted into admitting any\nwayfarer. As he fumbled the lock, a gust of wind came along, wrenched\nthe door from his hand and swung it open. To close it, he had to step\nout on the porch, and, when he stepped back into the house, the two\nlittle girls were standing within.\n\nThey were two poor beggar girls, ragged, dirty, and starving--two little\ntots bent under the burden of their beggar's packs, which were as large\nas themselves.\n\n\"Who are you that go prowling about at this hour of the night?\" said the\nmaster gruffly.\n\nThe two children did not answer immediately, but first removed their\npacks. Then they walked up to the man and stretched forth their tiny\nhands in greeting.\n\n\"We are Anna and Britta Maja from the Eng\u00c3\u00a4rd,\" said the elder, \"and we\nwere going to ask for a night's lodging.\"\n\nHe did not take the outstretched hands and was just about to drive out\nthe beggar children, when a fresh recollection faced him. Eng\u00c3\u00a4rd--was\nnot that a little cabin where a poor widow with five children had lived?\nThe widow had owed his father a few hundred kroner and in order to get\nback his money he had sold her cabin. After that the widow, with her\nthree eldest children, went to Norrland to seek employment, and the two\nyoungest became a charge on the parish.\n\nAs he called this to mind he grew bitter. He knew that his father had\nbeen severely censured for squeezing out that money, which by right\nbelonged to him.\n\n\"What are you doing nowadays?\" he asked in a cross tone. \"Didn't the\nboard of charities take charge of you? Why do you roam around and beg?\"\n\n\"It's not our fault,\" replied the larger girl. \"The people with whom we\nare living have sent us out to beg.\"\n\n\"Well, your packs are filled,\" the farmer observed, \"so you can't\ncomplain. Now you'd better take out some of the food you have with you\nand eat your fill, for here you'll get no food, as all the women folk\nare in bed. Later you may lie down in the corner by the hearth, so you\nwon't have to freeze.\"\n\nHe waved his hand, as if to ward them off, and his eyes took on a hard\nlook. He was thankful that he had had a father who had been careful of\nhis property. Otherwise, he might perhaps have been forced in childhood\nto run about and beg, as these children now did.\n\nNo sooner had he thought this out to the end than the shrill, mocking\nvoice he had heard once before that evening repeated it, word for word.\n\nHe listened, and at once understood that it was nothing--only the wind\nroaring in the chimney. But the queer thing about it was, when the wind\nrepeated his thoughts, they seemed so strangely stupid and hard and\nfalse!\n\nThe children meanwhile had stretched themselves, side by side, on the\nfloor. They were not quiet, but lay there muttering.\n\n\"Do be still, won't you?\" he growled, for he was in such an irritable\nmood that he could have beaten them.\n\nBut the mumbling continued, and again he called for silence.\n\n\"When mother went away,\" piped a clear little voice, \"she made me\npromise that every night I would say my evening prayer. I must do this,\nand Britta Maja too. As soon as we have said 'God who cares for little\nchildren--' we'll be quiet.\"\n\nThe master sat quite still while the little ones said their prayers,\nthen he rose and began pacing back and forth, back and forth, wringing\nhis hands all the while, as though he had met with some great sorrow.\n\n\"The horse driven out and wrecked, these two children turned into road\nbeggars--both father's doings! Perhaps father did not do right after\nall?\" he thought.\n\nHe sat down again and buried his head in his hands. Suddenly his lips\nbegan to quiver and into his eyes came tears, which he hastily wiped\naway. Fresh tears came, and he was just as prompt to brush these away;\nbut it was useless, for more followed.\n\nWhen his mother stepped into the room, he swung his chair quickly and\nturned his back to her. She must have noticed something unusual, for she\nstood quietly behind him a long while, as if waiting for him to speak.\nShe realized how difficult it always is for men to talk of the things\nthey feel most deeply. She must help him of course.\n\nFrom her bedroom she had observed all that had taken place in the living\nroom, so that she did not have to ask questions. She walked very softly\nover to the two sleeping children, lifted them, and bore them to her own\nbed. Then she went back to her son.\n\n\"Lars,\" she said, as if she did not see that he was weeping, \"you had\nbetter let me keep these children.\"\n\n\"What, mother?\" he gasped, trying to smother the sobs.\n\n\"I have been suffering for years--ever since father took the cabin from\ntheir mother, and so have you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"I want to keep them here and make something of them; they are too good\nto beg.\"\n\nHe could not speak, for now the tears were beyond his control; but he\ntook his old mother's withered hand and patted it.\n\nThen he jumped up, as if something had frightened him.\n\n\"What would father have said of this?\"\n\n\"Father had his day at ruling,\" retorted the mother. \"Now it is your\nday. As long as father lived we had to obey him. Now is the time to show\nwhat you are.\"\n\nHer son was so astonished that he ceased crying.\n\n\"But I have just shown what I am!\" he returned.\n\n\"No, you haven't,\" protested the mother. \"You only try to be like him.\nFather experienced hard times, which made him fear poverty. He believed\nthat he had to think of himself first. But you have never had any\ndifficulties that should make you hard. You have more than you need, and\nit would be unnatural of you not to think of others.\"\n\nWhen the two little girls entered the house the boy slipped in behind\nthem and secreted himself in a dark corner. He had not been there long\nbefore he caught a glimpse of the shed key, which the farmer had thrust\ninto his coat pocket.\n\n\"When the master of the house drives the children out, I'll take the key\nand ran,\" he thought.\n\nBut the children were not driven out and the boy crouched in the corner,\nnot knowing what he should do next.\n\nThe mother talked long with her son, and while she was speaking he\nstopped weeping. Gradually his features softened; he looked like another\nperson. All the while he was stroking the wasted old hand.\n\n\"Now we may as well retire,\" said the old lady when she saw that he was\ncalm again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, suddenly rising, \"I cannot retire yet. There's a stranger\nwithout whom I must shelter to-night!\"\n\nHe said nothing further, but quickly drew on his coat, lit the lantern\nand went out. There were the same wind and chill without, but as he\nstepped to the porch he began to sing softly. He wondered if the horse\nwould know him, and if he would be glad to come back to his old stable.\n\nAs he crossed the house yard he heard a door slam.\n\n\"That shed door has blown open again,\" he thought, and went over to\nclose it.\n\nA moment later he stood by the shed and was just going to shut the door,\nwhen he heard a rustling within.\n\nThe boy, who had watched his opportunity, had run directly to the shed,\nwhere he left the animals, but they were no longer out in the rain: A\nstrong wind had long since thrown open the door and helped them to get a\nroof over their heads. The patter which the master heard was occasioned\nby the boy running into the shed.\n\nBy the light of the lantern the man could see into the shed. The whole\nfloor was covered with sleeping cattle. There was no human being to be\nseen; the animals were not bound, but were lying, here and there, in the\nstraw.\n\nHe was enraged at the intrusion and began storming and shrieking to\nrouse the sleepers and drive them out. But the creatures lay still and\nwould not let themselves be disturbed. The only one that rose was an old\nhorse that came slowly toward him.\n\nAll of a sudden the man became silent. He recognized the beast by its\ngait. He raised the lantern, and the horse came over and laid its head\non his shoulder. The master patted and stroked it.\n\n\"My old horsy, my old horsy!\" he said. \"What have they done to you? Yes,\ndear, I'll buy you back. You'll never again have to leave this place.\nYou shall do whatever you like, horsy mine! Those whom you have brought\nwith you may remain here, but you shall come with me to the stable. Now\nI can give you all the oats you are able to eat, without having to\nsmuggle them. And you're not all used up, either! The handsomest horse\non the church knoll--that's what you shall be once more! There, there!\nThere, there!\"\n\n\nTHE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE\n\n\n_Thursday, April twenty-eighth_.\n\nThe following day the weather was clear and beautiful. There was a\nstrong west wind; people were glad of that, for it dried up the roads,\nwhich had been soaked by the heavy rains of the day before.\n\nEarly in the morning the two Sm\u00c3\u00a5land children, Osa, the goose girl, and\nlittle Mats, were out on the highway leading from S\u00c3\u00b6rmland to N\u00c3\u00a4rke. The\nroad ran alongside the southern shore of Hj\u00c3\u00a4lmar Lake and the children\nwere walking along looking at the ice, which covered the greater part of\nit. The morning sun darted its clear rays upon the ice, which did not\nlook dark and forbidding, like most spring ice, but sparkled temptingly.\nAs far as they could see, the ice was firm and dry. The rain had run\ndown into cracks and hollows, or been absorbed by the ice itself. The\nchildren saw only the sound ice.\n\nOsa, the goose girl, and little Mats were on their way North, and they\ncould not help thinking of all the steps they would be saved if they\ncould cut straight across the lake instead of going around it. They\nknew, to be sure, that spring ice is treacherous, but this looked\nperfectly secure. They could see that it was several inches thick near\nthe shore. They saw a path which they might follow, and the opposite\nshore appeared to be so near that they ought to be able to get there in\nan hour.\n\n\"Come, let's try!\" said little Mats. \"If we only look before us, so that\nwe don't go down into some hole, we can do it.\"\n\nSo they went out on the lake. The ice was not very slippery, but rather\neasy to walk upon. There was more water on it than they expected to see,\nand here and there were cracks, where the water purled up. One had to\nwatch out for such places; but that was easy to do in broad daylight,\nwith the sun shining.\n\nThe children advanced rapidly, and talked only of how sensible they were\nto have gone out on the ice instead of tramping the slushy road.\n\nWhen they had been walking a while they came to Vin Island, where an old\nwoman had sighted them from her window. She rushed from her cabin, waved\nthem back, and shouted something which they could not hear. They\nunderstood perfectly well that she was warning them not to come any\nfarther; but they thought there was no immediate danger. It would be\nstupid for them to leave the ice when all was going so well!\n\nTherefore they went on past Vin Island and had a stretch of seven miles\nof ice ahead of them.\n\nOut there was so much water that the children were obliged to take\nroundabout ways; but that was sport to them. They vied with each other\nas to which could find the soundest ice. They were neither tired nor\nhungry. The whole day was before them, and they laughed at each obstacle\nthey met.\n\nNow and then they cast a glance ahead at the farther shore. It still\nappeared far away, although they had been walking a good hour. They were\nrather surprised that the lake was so broad.\n\n\"The shore seems to be moving farther away from us,\" little Mats\nobserved.\n\nOut there the children were not protected against the wind, which was\nbecoming stronger and stronger every minute, and was pressing their\nclothing so close to their bodies that they could hardly go on. The cold\nwind was the first disagreeable thing they had met with on the journey.\n\nBut the amazing part of it was that the wind came sweeping along with a\nloud roar--as if it brought with it the noise of a large mill or\nfactory, though nothing of the kind was to be found out there on the\nice. They had walked to the west of the big island, Valen; now they\nthought they were nearing the north shore. Suddenly the wind began to\nblow more and more, while the loud roaring increased so rapidly that\nthey began to feel uneasy.\n\nAll at once it occurred to them that the roar was caused by the foaming\nand rushing of the waves breaking against a shore. Even this seemed\nimprobable, since the lake was still covered with ice.\n\nAt all events, they paused and looked about. They noticed far in the\nwest a white bank which stretched clear across the lake. At first they\nthought it was a snowbank alongside a road. Later they realized it was\nthe foam-capped waves dashing against the ice! They took hold of hands\nand ran without saying a word. Open sea lay beyond in the west, and\nsuddenly the streak of foam appeared to be moving eastward. They\nwondered if the ice was going to break all over. What was going to\nhappen? They felt now that they were in great danger.\n\nAll at once it seemed as if the ice under their feet rose--rose and\nsank, as if some one from below were pushing it. Presently they heard a\nhollow boom, and then there were cracks in the ice all around them. The\nchildren could see how they crept along under the ice-covering.\n\nThe next moment all was still, then the rising and sinking began again.\nThereupon the cracks began to widen into crevices through which the\nwater bubbled up. By and by the crevices became gaps. Soon after that\nthe ice was divided into large floes.\n\n\"Osa,\" said little Mats, \"this must be the breaking up of the ice!\"\n\n\"Why, so it is, little Mats,\" said Osa, \"but as yet we can get to land.\nRun for your life!\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, the wind and waves had a good deal of work to do\nyet to clear the ice from the lake. The hardest part was done when the\nice-cake burst into pieces, but all these pieces must be broken and\nhurled against each other, to be crushed, worn down, and dissolved.\nThere was still a great deal of hard and sound ice left, which formed\nlarge, unbroken surfaces.\n\nThe greatest danger for the children lay in the fact that they had no\ngeneral view of the ice. They did not see the places where the gaps were\nso wide that they could not possibly jump over them, nor did they know\nwhere to find any floes that would hold them, so they wandered aimlessly\nback and forth, going farther out on the lake instead of nearer land. At\nlast, confused and terrified, they stood still and wept.\n\nThen a flock of wild geese in rapid flight came rushing by. They\nshrieked loudly and sharply; but the strange thing was that above the\ngeese-cackle the little children heard these words:\n\n\"You must go to the right, the right, the right!\" They began at once to\nfollow the advice; but before long they were again standing irresolute,\nfacing another broad gap.\n\nAgain they heard the geese shrieking above them, and again, amid the\ngeese-cackle, they distinguished a few words:\n\n\"Stand where you are! Stand where you are!\"\n\nThe children did not say a word to each other, but obeyed and stood\nstill. Soon after that the ice-floes floated together, so that they\ncould cross the gap. Then they took hold of hands again and ran. They\nwere afraid not only of the peril, but of the mysterious help that had\ncome to them.\n\nSoon they had to stop again, and immediately the sound of the voice\nreached them.\n\n\"Straight ahead, straight ahead!\" it said.\n\nThis leading continued for about half an hour; by that time they had\nreached Ljunger Point, where they left the ice and waded to shore. They\nwere still terribly frightened, even though they were on firm land. They\ndid not stop to look back at the lake--where the waves were pitching the\nice-floes faster and faster--but ran on. When they had gone a short\ndistance along the point, Osa paused suddenly.\n\n\"Wait here, little Mats,\" she said; \"I have forgotten something.\"\n\nOsa, the goose girl, went down to the strand again, where she stopped to\nrummage in her bag. Finally she fished out a little wooden shoe, which\nshe placed on a stone where it could be plainly seen. Then she ran to\nlittle Mats without once looking back.\n\nBut the instant her back was turned, a big white goose shot down from\nthe sky, like a streak of lightning, snatched the wooden shoe, and flew\naway with it.\n\n\nTHUMBIETOT AND THE BEARS\n\n\nTHE IRONWORKS\n\n_Thursday, April twenty-eighth_.\n\nWhen the wild geese and Thumbietot had helped Osa, the goose girl, and\nlittle Mats across the ice, they flew into Westmanland, where they\nalighted in a grain field to feed and rest.\n\nA strong west wind blew almost the entire day on which the wild geese\ntravelled over the mining districts, and as soon as they attempted to\ndirect their course northward they were buffeted toward the east. Now,\nAkka thought that Smirre Fox was at large in the eastern part of the\nprovince; therefore she would not fly in that direction, but turned\nback, time and again, struggling westward with great difficulty. At this\nrate the wild geese advanced very slowly, and late in the afternoon they\nwere still in the Westmanland mining districts. Toward evening the wind\nabated suddenly, and the tired travellers hoped that they would have an\ninterval of easy flight before sundown. Then along came a violent gust\nof wind, which tossed the geese before it, like balls, and the boy, who\nwas sitting comfortably, with no thought of peril, was lifted from the\ngoose's back and hurled into space.\n\nLittle and light as he was, he could not fall straight to the ground in\nsuch a wind; so at first he was carried along with it, drifting down\nslowly and spasmodically, as a leaf falls from a tree.\n\n\"Why, this isn't so bad!\" thought the boy as he fell. \"I'm tumbling as\neasily as if I were only a scrap of paper. Morten Goosey-Gander will\ndoubtless hurry along and pick me up.\"\n\nThe first thing the boy did when he landed was to tear off his cap and\nwave it, so that the big white gander should see where he was.\n\n\"Here am I, where are you? Here am I, where are you?\" he called, and was\nrather surprised that Morten Goosey-Gander was not already at his side.\n\nBut the big white gander was not to be seen, nor was the wild goose\nflock outlined against the sky. It had entirely disappeared.\n\nHe thought this rather singular, but he was neither worried nor\nfrightened. Not for a second did it occur to him that folk like Akka and\nMorten Goosey-Gander would abandon him. The unexpected gust of wind had\nprobably borne them along with it. As soon as they could manage to turn,\nthey would surely come back and fetch him.\n\nBut what was this? Where on earth was he anyway? He had been standing\ngazing toward the sky for some sign of the geese, but now he happened to\nglance about him. He had not come down on even ground, but had dropped\ninto a deep, wide mountain cave--or whatever it might be. It was as\nlarge as a church, with almost perpendicular walls on all four sides,\nand with no roof at all. On the ground were some huge rocks, between\nwhich moss and lignon-brush and dwarfed birches grew. Here and there in\nthe wall were projections, from which swung rickety ladders. At one side\nthere was a dark passage, which apparently led far into the mountain.\n\nThe boy had not been travelling over the mining districts a whole day\nfor nothing. He comprehended at once that the big cleft had been made by\nthe men who had mined ore in this place.\n\n\"I must try and climb back to earth again,\" he thought, \"otherwise I\nfear that my companions won't find me!\"\n\nHe was about to go over to the wall when some one seized him from\nbehind, and he heard a gruff voice growl in his ear: \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe boy turned quickly, and, in the confusion of the moment, he thought\nhe was facing a huge rock, covered with brownish moss. Then he noticed\nthat the rock had broad paws to walk with, a head, two eyes, and a\ngrowling mouth.\n\nHe could not pull himself together to answer, nor did the big beast\nappear to expect it of him, for it knocked him down, rolled him back and\nforth with its paws, and nosed him. It seemed just about ready to\nswallow him, when it changed its mind and called:\n\n\"Brumme and Mulle, come here, you cubs, and you shall have something\ngood to eat!\"\n\nA pair of frowzy cubs, as uncertain on their feet and as woolly as\npuppies, came tumbling along.\n\n\"What have you got, Mamma Bear? May we see, oh, may we see?\" shrieked\nthe cubs excitedly.\n\n\"Oho! so I've fallen in with bears,\" thought the boy to himself. \"Now\nSmirre Fox won't have to trouble himself further to chase after me!\"\n\nThe mother bear pushed the boy along to the cubs. One of them nabbed him\nquickly and ran off with him; but he did not bite hard. He was playful\nand wanted to amuse himself awhile with Thumbietot before eating him.\nThe other cub was after the first one to snatch the boy for himself, and\nas he lumbered along he managed to tumble straight down on the head of\nthe one that carried the boy. So the two cubs rolled over each other,\nbiting, clawing, and snarling.\n\nDuring the tussle the boy got loose, ran over to the wall, and started\nto scale it. Then both cubs scurried after him, and, nimbly scaling the\ncliff, they caught up with him and tossed him down on the moss, like a\nball.\n\n\"Now I know how a poor little mousie fares when it falls into the cat's\nclaws,\" thought the boy.\n\nHe made several attempts to get away. He ran deep down into the old\ntunnel and hid behind the rocks and climbed the birches, but the cubs\nhunted him out, go where he would. The instant they caught him they let\nhim go, so that he could run away again and they should have the fun of\nrecapturing him.\n\nAt last the boy got so sick and tired of it all that he threw himself\ndown on the ground.\n\n\"Run away,\" growled the cubs, \"or we'll eat you up!\"\n\n\"You'll have to eat me then,\" said the boy, \"for I can't run any more.\"\n\nImmediately both cubs rushed over to the mother bear and complained:\n\n\"Mamma Bear, oh, Mamma Bear, he won't play any more.\"\n\n\"Then you must divide him evenly between you,\" said Mother Bear.\n\nWhen the boy heard this he was so scared that he jumped up instantly and\nbegan playing again.\n\nAs it was bedtime, Mother Bear called to the cubs that they must come\nnow and cuddle up to her and go to sleep. They had been having such a\ngood time that they wished to continue their play next day; so they took\nthe boy between them and laid their paws over him. They did not want him\nto move without waking them. They went to sleep immediately. The boy\nthought that after a while he would try to steal away. But never in all\nhis life had he been so tumbled and tossed and hunted and rolled! And he\nwas so tired out that he too fell asleep.\n\nBy and by Father Bear came clambering down the mountain wall. The boy\nwas wakened by his tearing away stone and gravel as he swung himself\ninto the old mine. The boy was afraid to move much; but he managed to\nstretch himself and turn over, so that he could see the big bear. He was\na frightfully coarse, huge old beast, with great paws, large, glistening\ntusks, and wicked little eyes! The boy could not help shuddering as he\nlooked at this old monarch of the forest.\n\n\"It smells like a human being around here,\" said Father Bear the instant\nhe came up to Mother Bear, and his growl was as the rolling of thunder.\n\n\"How can you imagine anything so absurd?\" said Mother Bear without\ndisturbing herself. \"It has been settled for good and all that we are\nnot to harm mankind any more; but if one of them were to put in an\nappearance here, where the cubs and I have our quarters, there wouldn't\nbe enough left of him for you to catch even a scent of him!\"\n\nFather Bear lay down beside Mother Bear. \"You ought to know me well\nenough to understand that I don't allow anything dangerous to come near\nthe cubs. Talk, instead, of what you have been doing. I haven't seen you\nfor a whole week!\"\n\n\"I've been looking about for a new residence,\" said Father Bear. \"First\nI went over to Vermland, to learn from our kinsmen at Eksh\u00c3\u00a4rad how they\nfared in that country; but I had my trouble for nothing. There wasn't a\nbear's den left in the whole forest.\"\n\n\"I believe the humans want the whole earth to themselves,\" said Mother\nBear. \"Even if we leave people and cattle in peace and live solely upon\nlignon and insects and green things, we cannot remain unmolested in the\nforest! I wonder where we could move to in order to live in peace?\"\n\n\"We've lived comfortably for many years in this pit,\" observed Father\nBear. \"But I can't be content here now since the big noise-shop has been\nbuilt right in our neighbourhood. Lately I have been taking a look at\nthe land east of Dal River, over by Garpen Mountain. Old mine pits are\nplentiful there, too, and other fine retreats. I thought it looked as if\none might be fairly protected against men--\"\n\nThe instant Father Bear said this he sat up and began to sniff.\n\n\"It's extraordinary that whenever I speak of human beings I catch that\nqueer scent again,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Go and see for yourself if you don't believe me!\" challenged Mother\nBear. \"I should just like to know where a human being could manage to\nhide down here?\"\n\nThe bear walked all around the cave, and nosed. Finally he went back and\nlay down without a word.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" said Mother Bear. \"But of course you think that\nno one but yourself has any nose or ears!\"\n\n\"One can't be too careful, with such neighbours as we have,\" said Father\nBear gently. Then he leaped up with a roar. As luck would have it, one\nof the cubs had moved a paw over to Nils Holgersson's face and the poor\nlittle wretch could not breathe, but began to sneeze. It was impossible\nfor Mother Bear to keep Father Bear back any longer. He pushed the young\nones to right and left and caught sight of the boy before he had time to\nsit up.\n\nHe would have swallowed him instantly if Mother Bear had not cast\nherself between them.\n\n\"Don't touch him! He belongs to the cubs,\" she said. \"They have had\nsuch fun with him the whole evening that they couldn't bear to eat him\nup, but wanted to save him until morning.\"\n\nFather Bear pushed Mother Bear aside.\n\n\"Don't meddle with what you don't understand!\" he roared. \"Can't you\nscent that human odour about him from afar? I shall eat him at once, or\nhe will play us some mean trick.\"\n\nHe opened his jaws again; but meanwhile the boy had had time to think,\nand, quick as a flash, he dug into his knapsack and brought forth some\nmatches--his sole weapon of defence--struck one on his leather breeches,\nand stuck the burning match into the bear's open mouth.\n\nFather Bear snorted when he smelled the sulphur, and with that the flame\nwent out. The boy was ready with another match, but, curiously enough,\nFather Bear did not repeat his attack.\n\n\"Can you light many of those little blue roses?\" asked Father Bear.\n\n\"I can light enough to put an end to the whole forest,\" replied the boy,\nfor he thought that in this way he might be able to scare Father Bear.\n\n\"Oh, that would be no trick for me!\" boasted the boy, hoping that this\nwould make the bear respect him.\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed the bear. \"You shall render me a service. Now I'm very\nglad that I did not eat you!\"\n\nFather Bear carefully took the boy between his tusks and climbed up from\nthe pit. He did this with remarkable ease and agility, considering that\nhe was so big and heavy. As soon as he was up, he speedily made for the\nwoods. It was evident that Father Bear was created to squeeze through\ndense forests. The heavy body pushed through the brushwood as a boat\ndoes through the water.\n\nFather Bear ran along till he came to a hill at the skirt of the forest,\nwhere he could see the big noise-shop. Here he lay down and placed the\nboy in front of him, holding him securely between his forepaws.\n\n\"Now look down at that big noise-shop!\" he commanded. The great\nironworks, with many tall buildings, stood at the edge of a waterfall.\nHigh chimneys sent forth dark clouds of smoke, blasting furnaces were in\nfull blaze, and light shone from all the windows and apertures. Within\nhammers and rolling mills were going with such force that the air rang\nwith their clatter and boom. All around the workshops proper were\nimmense coal sheds, great slag heaps, warehouses, wood piles, and tool\nsheds. Just beyond were long rows of workingmen's homes, pretty villas,\nschoolhouses, assembly halls, and shops. But there all was quiet and\napparently everybody was asleep. The boy did not glance in that\ndirection, but gazed intently at the ironworks. The earth around them\nwas black; the sky above them was like a great fiery dome; the rapids,\nwhite with foam, rushed by; while the buildings themselves were sending\nout light and smoke, fire and sparks. It was the grandest sight the boy\nhad ever seen!\n\n\"Surely you don't mean to say you can set fire to a place like that?\"\nremarked the bear doubtingly.\n\nThe boy stood wedged between the beast's paws thinking the only thing\nthat might save him would be that the bear should have a high opinion of\nhis capability and power.\n\n\"It's all the same to me,\" he answered with a superior air. \"Big or\nlittle, I can burn it down.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you something,\" said Father Bear. \"My forefathers lived\nin this region from the time that the forests first sprang up. From\nthem I inherited hunting grounds and pastures, lairs and retreats, and\nhave lived here in peace all my life. In the beginning I wasn't troubled\nmuch by the human kind. They dug in the mountains and picked up a little\nore down here, by the rapids; they had a forge and a furnace, but the\nhammers sounded only a few hours during the day, and the furnace was not\nfired more than two moons at a stretch. It wasn't so bad but that I\ncould stand it; but these last years, since they have built this\nnoise-shop, which keeps up the same racket both day and night, life here\nhas become intolerable. Formerly only a manager and a couple of\nblacksmiths lived here, but now there are so many people that I can\nnever feel safe from them. I thought that I should have to move away,\nbut I have discovered something better!\"\n\nThe boy wondered what Father Bear had hit upon, but no opportunity was\nafforded him to ask, as the bear took him between his tusks again and\nlumbered down the hill. The boy could see nothing, but knew by the\nincreasing noise that they were approaching the rolling mills.\n\nFather Bear was well informed regarding the ironworks. He had prowled\naround there on many a dark night, had observed what went on within, and\nhad wondered if there would never be any cessation of the work. He had\ntested the walls with his paws and wished that he were only strong\nenough to knock down the whole structure with a single blow.\n\nHe was not easily distinguishable against the dark ground, and when, in\naddition, he remained in the shadow of the walls, there was not much\ndanger of his being discovered. Now he walked fearlessly between the\nworkshops and climbed to the top of a slag heap. There he sat up on his\nhaunches, took the boy between his forepaws and held him up.\n\n\"Try to look into the house!\" he commanded. A strong current of air was\nforced into a big cylinder which was suspended from the ceiling and\nfilled with molten iron. As this current rushed into the mess of iron\nwith an awful roar, showers of sparks of all colours spurted up in\nbunches, in sprays, in long clusters! They struck against the wall and\ncame splashing down over the whole big room. Father Bear let the boy\nwatch the gorgeous spectacle until the blowing was over and the flowing\nand sparkling red steel had been poured into ingot moulds.\n\nThe boy was completely charmed by the marvellous display and almost\nforgot that he was imprisoned between a bear's two paws.\n\nFather Bear let him look into the rolling mill. He saw a workman take a\nshort, thick bar of iron at white heat from a furnace opening and place\nit under a roller. When the iron came out from under the roller, it was\nflattened and extended. Immediately another workman seized it and placed\nit beneath a heavier roller, which made it still longer and thinner.\nThus it was passed from roller to roller, squeezed and drawn out until,\nfinally, it curled along the floor, like a long red thread.\n\nBut while the first bar of iron was being pressed, a second was taken\nfrom the furnace and placed under the rollers, and when this was a\nlittle along, a third was brought. Continuously fresh threads came\ncrawling over the floor, like hissing snakes. The boy was dazzled by the\niron. But he found it more splendid to watch the workmen who,\ndexterously and delicately, seized the glowing snakes with their tongs\nand forced them under the rollers. It seemed like play for them to\nhandle the hissing iron.\n\n\"I call that real man's work!\" the boy remarked to himself.\n\nThe bear then let the boy have a peep at the furnace and the forge, and\nhe became more and more astonished as he saw how the blacksmiths handled\niron and fire.\n\n\"Those men have no fear of heat and flames,\" he thought. The workmen\nwere sooty and grimy. He fancied they were some sort of firefolk--that\nwas why they could bend and mould the iron as they wished. He could not\nbelieve that they were just ordinary men, since they had such power!\n\n\"They keep this up day after day, night after night,\" said Father Bear,\nas he dropped wearily down on the ground. \"You can understand that one\ngets rather tired of that kind of thing. I'm mighty glad that at last I\ncan put an end to it!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the boy. \"How will you go about it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought that you were going to set fire to the buildings!\" said\nFather Bear. \"That would put an end to all this work, and I could remain\nin my old home.\"\n\nThe boy was all of a shiver.\n\nSo it was for this that Father Bear had brought him here!\n\n\"If you will set fire to the noise-works, I'll promise to spare your\nlife,\" said Father Bear. \"But if you don't do it, I'll make short work\nof you!\" The huge workshops were built of brick, and the boy was\nthinking to himself that Father Bear could command as much as he liked,\nit was impossible to obey him. Presently he saw that it might not be\nimpossible after all. Just beyond them lay a pile of chips and shavings\nto which he could easily set fire, and beside it was a wood pile that\nalmost reached the coal shed. The coal shed extended over to the\nworkshops, and if that once caught fire, the flames would soon fly over\nto the roof of the iron foundry. Everything combustible would burn, the\nwalls would fall from the heat, and the machinery would be destroyed.\n\"Will you or won't you?\" demanded Father Bear. The boy knew that he\nought to answer promptly that he would not, but he also knew that then\nthe bear's paws would squeeze him to death; therefore he replied:\n\n\"I shall have to think it over.\"\n\n\"Very well, do so,\" assented Father Bear. \"Let me say to you that iron\nis the thing that has given men the advantage over us bears, which is\nanother reason for my wishing to put an end to the work here.\"\n\nThe boy thought he would use the delay to figure out some plan of\nescape, but he was so worried he could not direct his thoughts where he\nwould; instead he began to think of the great help that iron had been to\nmankind. They needed iron for everything. There was iron in the plough\nthat broke up the field, in the axe that felled the tree for building\nhouses, in the scythe that mowed the grain, and in the knife, which\ncould be turned to all sorts of uses. There was iron in the horse's bit,\nin the lock on the door, in the nails that held furniture together, in\nthe sheathing that covered the roof. The rifle which drove away wild\nbeasts was made of iron, also the pick that had broken up the mine. Iron\ncovered the men-of-war he had seen at Karlskrona; the locomotives\nsteamed through the country on iron rails; the needle that had stitched\nhis coat was of iron; the shears that clipped the sheep and the kettle\nthat cooked the food. Big and little alike--much that was indispensable\nwas made from iron. Father Bear was perfectly right in saying that it\nwas the iron that had given men their mastery over the bears.\n\n\"Now will you or won't you?\" Father Bear repeated.\n\nThe boy was startled from his musing. Here he stood thinking of matters\nthat were entirely unnecessary, and had not yet found a way to save\nhimself!\n\n\"You mustn't be so impatient,\" he said. \"This is a serious matter for\nme, and I've got to have time to consider.\"\n\n\"Well, then, consider another moment,\" said Father Bear. \"But let me\ntell you that it's because of the iron that men have become so much\nwiser than we bears. For this alone, if for nothing else, I should like\nto put a stop to the work here.\"\n\nAgain the boy endeavoured to think out a plan of escape, but his\nthoughts wandered, willy nilly. They were taken up with the iron. And\ngradually he began to comprehend how much thinking and calculating men\nmust have done before they discovered how to produce iron from ore, and\nhe seemed to see sooty blacksmiths of old bending over the forge,\npondering how they should properly handle it. Perhaps it was because\nthey had thought so much about the iron that intelligence had been\ndeveloped in mankind, until finally they became so advanced that they\nwere able to build great works like these. The fact was that men owed\nmore to the iron than they themselves knew.\n\n\"Well, what say you? Will you or won't you?\" insisted Father Bear.\n\nThe boy shrank back. Here he stood thinking needless thoughts, and had\nno idea as to what he should do to save himself.\n\n\"It's not such an easy matter to decide as you think,\" he answered. \"You\nmust give me time for reflection.\"\n\n\"I can wait for you a little longer,\" said Father Bear. \"But after that\nyou'll get no more grace. You must know that it's the fault of the iron\nthat the human kind can live here on the property of the bears. And now\nyou understand why I would be rid of the work.\"\n\nThe boy meant to use the last moment to think out some way to save\nhimself, but, anxious and distraught as he was, his thoughts wandered\nagain. Now he began thinking of all that he had seen when he flew over\nthe mining districts. It was strange that there should be so much life\nand activity and so much work back there in the wilderness.\n\n\"Just think how poor and desolate this place would be had there been no\niron here!\n\n\"This very foundry gave employment to many, and had gathered around it\nmany homes filled with people, who, in turn, had attracted hither\nrailways and telegraph wires and--\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" growled the bear. \"Will you or won't you?\"\n\nThe boy swept his hand across his forehead. No plan of escape had as yet\ncome to his mind, but this much he knew--he did not wish to do any harm\nto the iron, which was so useful to rich and poor alike, and which gave\nbread to so many people in this land.\n\n\"I won't!\" he said.\n\nFather Bear squeezed him a little harder, but said nothing.\n\n\"You'll not get me to destroy the ironworks!\" defied the boy. \"The iron\nis so great a blessing that it will never do to harm it.\"\n\n\"Then of course you don't expect to be allowed to live very long?\" said\nthe bear.\n\n\"No, I don't expect it,\" returned the boy, looking the bear straight in\nthe eye.\n\nFather Bear gripped him still harder. It hurt so that the boy could not\nkeep the tears back, but he did not cry out or say a word.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Father Bear, raising his paw very slowly, hoping\nthat the boy would give in at the last moment.\n\nBut just then the boy heard something click very close to them, and saw\nthe muzzle of a rifle two paces away. Both he and Father Bear had been\nso engrossed in their own affairs they had not observed that a man had\nstolen right upon them.\n\n\"Father Bear! Don't you hear the clicking of a trigger?\" cried the boy.\n\"Run, or you'll be shot!\"\n\nFather Bear grew terribly hurried. However, he allowed himself time\nenough to pick up the boy and carry him along. As he ran, a couple of\nshots sounded, and the bullets grazed his ears, but, luckily, he\nescaped.\n\nThe boy thought, as he was dangling from the bear's mouth, that never\nhad he been so stupid as he was to-night. If he had only kept still, the\nbear would have been shot, and he himself would have been freed. But he\nhad become so accustomed to helping the animals that he did it\nnaturally, and as a matter of course.\n\nWhen Father Bear had run some distance into the woods, he paused and set\nthe boy down on the ground.\n\n\"Thank you, little one!\" he said. \"I dare say those bullets would have\ncaught me if you hadn't been there. And now I want to do you a service\nin return. If you should ever meet with another bear, just say to him\nthis--which I shall whisper to you--and he won't touch you.\"\n\nFather Bear whispered a word or two into the boy's ear and hurried away,\nfor he thought he heard hounds and hunters pursuing him.\n\nThe boy stood in the forest, free and unharmed, and could hardly\nunderstand how it was possible.\n\nThe wild geese had been flying back and forth the whole evening, peering\nand calling, but they had been unable to find Thumbietot. They searched\nlong after the sun had set, and, finally, when it had grown so dark that\nthey were forced to alight somewhere for the night, they were very\ndownhearted. There was not one among them but thought the boy had been\nkilled by the fall and was lying dead in the forest, where they could\nnot see him.\n\nBut the next morning, when the sun peeped over the hills and awakened\nthe wild geese, the boy lay sleeping, as usual, in their midst. When he\nwoke and heard them shrieking and cackling their astonishment, he could\nnot help laughing.\n\nThey were so eager to know what had happened to him that they did not\ncare to go to breakfast until he had told them the whole story. The boy\nsoon narrated his entire adventure with the bears, but after that he\nseemed reluctant to continue.\n\n\"How I got back to you perhaps you already know?\" he said.\n\n\"No, we know nothing. We thought you were killed.\"\n\n\"That's curious!\" remarked the boy. \"Oh, yes!--when Father Bear left me\nI climbed up into a pine and fell asleep. At daybreak I was awakened by\nan eagle hovering over me. He picked me up with his talons and carried\nme away. He didn't hurt me, but flew straight here to you and dropped me\ndown among you.\"\n\n\"Didn't he tell you who he was?\" asked the big white gander.\n\n\"He was gone before I had time even to thank him. I thought that Mother\nAkka had sent him after me.\"\n\n\"How extraordinary!\" exclaimed the white goosey-gander. \"But are you\ncertain that it was an eagle?\"\n\n\"I had never before seen an eagle,\" said the boy, \"but he was so big\nand splendid that I can't give him a lowlier name!\"\n\nMorten Goosey-Gander turned to the wild geese to hear what they thought\nof this; but they stood gazing into the air, as though they were\nthinking of something else.\n\n\"We must not forget entirely to eat breakfast today,\" said Akka, quickly\nspreading her wings.\n\n\nTHE FLOOD\n\n\nTHE SWANS\n\n_May first to fourth_.\n\nThere was a terrible storm raging in the district north of Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar,\nwhich lasted several days. The sky was a dull gray, the wind whistled,\nand the rain beat. Both people and animals knew the spring could not be\nushered in with anything short of this; nevertheless they thought it\nunbearable.\n\nAfter it had been raining for a whole day, the snowdrifts in the pine\nforests began to melt in earnest, and the spring brooks grew lively. All\nthe pools on the farms, the standing water in the ditches, the water\nthat oozed between the tufts in marshes and swamps--all were in motion\nand tried to find their way to creeks, that they might be borne along to\nthe sea.\n\nThe creeks rushed as fast as possible down to the rivers, and the rivers\ndid their utmost to carry the water to Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar.\n\nAll the lakes and rivers in Uppland and the mining district quickly\nthrew off their ice covers on one and the same day, so that the creeks\nfilled with ice-floes which rose clear up to their banks.\n\nSwollen as they were, they emptied into Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar, and it was not long\nbefore the lake had taken in as much water as it could well hold. Down\nby the outlet was a raging torrent. Norrstr\u00c3\u00b6m is a narrow channel, and\nit could not let out the water quickly enough. Besides, there was a\nstrong easterly wind that lashed against the land, obstructing the\nstream when it tried to carry the fresh water into the East Sea. Since\nthe rivers kept running to M\u00c3\u00a4laren with more water than it could dispose\nof, there was nothing for the big lake to do but overflow its banks.\n\nIt rose very slowly, as if reluctant to injure its beautiful shores; but\nas they were mostly low and gradually sloping, it was not long before\nthe water had flooded several acres of land, and that was enough to\ncreate the greatest alarm.\n\nLake M\u00c3\u00a4lar is unique in its way, being made up of a succession of narrow\nfiords, bays, and inlets. In no place does it spread into a storm\ncentre, but seems to have been created only for pleasure trips, yachting\ntours, and fishing. Nowhere does it present barren, desolate, wind-swept\nshores. It looks as if it never thought that its shores could hold\nanything but country seats, summer villas, manors, and amusement\nresorts. But, because it usually presents a very agreeable and friendly\nappearance, there is all the more havoc whenever it happens to drop its\nsmiling expression in the spring, and show that it can be serious.\n\nAt that critical time Smirre Fox happened to come sneaking through a\nbirch grove just north of Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar. As usual, he was thinking of\nThumbietot and the wild geese, and wondering how he should ever find\nthem again. He had lost all track of them.\n\nAs he stole cautiously along, more discouraged than usual, he caught\nsight of Agar, the carrier-pigeon, who had perched herself on a birch\nbranch.\n\n\"My, but I'm in luck to run across you, Agar!\" exclaimed Smirre. \"Maybe\nyou can tell me where Akka from Kebnekaise and her flock hold forth\nnowadays?\"\n\n\"It's quite possible that I know where they are,\" Agar hinted, \"but I'm\nnot likely to tell you!\"\n\n\"Please yourself!\" retorted Smirre. \"Nevertheless, you can take a\nmessage that I have for them. You probably know the present condition of\nLake M\u00c3\u00a4lar? There's a great overflow down there and all the swans who\nlive in Hj\u00c3\u00a4lsta Bay are about to see their nests, with all their eggs,\ndestroyed. Daylight, the swan-king, has heard of the midget who travels\nwith the wild geese and knows a remedy for every ill. He has sent me to\nask Akka if she will bring Thumbietot down to Hj\u00c3\u00a4lsta Bay.\"\n\n\"I dare say I can convey your message,\" Agar replied, \"but I can't\nunderstand how the little boy will be able to help the swans.\"\n\n\"Nor do I,\" said Smirre, \"but he can do almost everything, it seems.\"\n\n\"It's surprising to me that Daylight should send his messages by a fox,\"\nAgar remarked.\n\n\"Well, we're not exactly what you'd call good friends,\" said Smirre\nsmoothly, \"but in an emergency like this we must help each other.\nPerhaps it would be just as well not to tell Akka that you got the\nmessage from a fox. Between you and me, she's inclined to be a little\nsuspicious.\"\n\nThe safest refuge for water-fowl in the whole M\u00c3\u00a4lar district is Hj\u00c3\u00a4lsta\nBay. It has low shores, shallow water and is also covered with reeds.\n\nIt is by no means as large as Lake T\u00c3\u00a5kern, but nevertheless Hj\u00c3\u00a4lsta is a\ngood retreat for birds, since it has long been forbidden territory to\nhunters.\n\nIt is the home of a great many swans, and the owner of the old castle\nnearby has prohibited all shooting on the bay, so that they might be\nunmolested.\n\nAs soon as Akka received word that the swans needed her help, she\nhastened down to Hj\u00c3\u00a4lsta Bay. She arrived with her flock one evening and\nsaw at a glance that there had been a great disaster. The big swans'\nnests had been torn away, and the strong wind was driving them down the\nbay. Some had already fallen apart, two or three had capsized, and the\neggs lay at the bottom of the lake.\n\nWhen Akka alighted on the bay, all the swans living there were gathered\nnear the eastern shore, where they were protected from the wind.\n\nAlthough they had suffered much by the flood, they were too proud to let\nany one see it.\n\n\"It is useless to cry,\" they said. \"There are plenty of root-fibres and\nstems here; we can soon build new nests.\"\n\nNone had thought of asking a stranger to help them, and the swans had no\nidea that Smirre Fox had sent for the wild geese!\n\nThere were several hundred swans resting on the water. They had placed\nthemselves according to rank and station. The young and inexperienced\nwere farthest out, the old and wise nearer the middle of the group, and\nright in the centre sat Daylight, the swan-king, and Snow-White, the\nswan-queen, who were older than any of the others and regarded the rest\nof the swans as their children.\n\nThe geese alighted on the west shore of the bay; but when Akka saw where\nthe swans were, she swam toward them at once. She was very much\nsurprised at their having sent for her, but she regarded it as an honour\nand did not wish to lose a moment in coming to their aid.\n\nAs Akka approached the swans she paused to see if the geese who followed\nher swam in a straight line, and at even distances apart.\n\n\"Now, swim along quickly!\" she ordered. \"Don't stare at the swans as if\nyou had never before seen anything beautiful, and don't mind what they\nmay say to you!\"\n\nThis was not the first time that Akka had called on the aristocratic\nswans. They had always received her in a manner befitting a great\ntraveller like herself.\n\nBut still she did not like the idea of swimming in among them. She never\nfelt so gray and insignificant as when she happened upon swans. One or\nanother of them was sure to drop a remark about \"common gray-feathers\"\nand \"poor folk.\" But it is always best to take no notice of such things.\n\nThis time everything passed off uncommonly well. The swans politely made\nway for the wild geese, who swam forward through a kind of passageway,\nwhich formed an avenue bordered by shimmering, white birds.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight to watch them as they spread their wings, like\nsails, to appear well before the strangers. They refrained from making\ncomments, which rather surprised Akka.\n\nEvidently Daylight had noted their misbehaviour in the past and had told\nthe swans that they must conduct themselves in a proper manner--so\nthought the leader-goose.\n\nBut just as the swans were making an effort to observe the rules of\netiquette, they caught sight of the goosey-gander, who swam last in the\nlong goose-line. Then there was a murmur of disapproval, even of\nthreats, among the swans, and at once there was an end to their good\ndeportment!\n\n\"What's this?\" shrieked one. \"Do the wild geese intend to dress up in\nwhite feathers?\"\n\n\"They needn't think that will make swans of them,\" cried another.\n\nThey began shrieking--one louder than another--in their strong, resonant\nvoices. It was impossible to explain that a tame goosey-gander had come\nwith the wild geese.\n\n\"That must be the goose-king himself coming along,\" they said\ntauntingly. \"There's no limit to their audacity!\"\n\n\"That's no goose, it's only a tame duck.\"\n\nThe big white gander remembered Akka's admonition to pay no attention,\nno matter what he might hear. He kept quiet and swam ahead as fast he\ncould, but it did no good. The swans became more and more impertinent.\n\n\"What kind of a frog does he carry on his back?\" asked one. \"They must\nthink we don't see it's a frog because it is dressed like a human\nbeing.\"\n\nThe swans, who but a moment before had been resting in such perfect\norder, now swam up and down excitedly. All tried to crowd forward to get\na glimpse of the white wild goose.\n\n\"That white goosey-gander ought to be ashamed to come here and parade\nbefore swans!\"\n\n\"He's probably as gray as the rest of them. He has only been in a flour\nbarrel at some farm house!\"\n\nAkka had just come up to Daylight and was about to ask him what kind of\nhelp he wanted of her, when the swan-king noticed the uproar among the\nswans.\n\n\"What do I see? Haven't I taught you to be polite to strangers?\" he said\nwith a frown.\n\nSnow-White, the swan-queen, swam out to restore order among her\nsubjects, and again Daylight turned to Akka.\n\nPresently Snow-White came back, appearing greatly agitated.\n\n\"Can't you keep them quiet?\" shouted Daylight.\n\n\"There's a white wild goose over there,\" answered Snow-White. \"Is it not\nshameful? I don't wonder they are furious!\"\n\n\"A white wild goose?\" scoffed Daylight. \"That's too ridiculous! There\ncan't be such a thing. You must be mistaken.\"\n\nThe crowds around Morten Goosey-Gander grew larger and larger. Akka and\nthe other wild geese tried to swim over to him, but were jostled hither\nand thither and could not get to him.\n\nThe old swan-king, who was the strongest among them, swam off quickly,\npushed all the others aside, and made his way over to the big white\ngander. But when he saw that there really was a white goose on the\nwater, he was just as indignant as the rest.\n\nHe hissed with rage, flew straight at Morten Goosey-Gander and tore out\na few feathers.\n\n\"I'll teach you a lesson, wild goose,\" he shrieked, \"so that you'll not\ncome again to the swans, togged out in this way!\"\n\n\"Fly, Morten Goosey-Gander! Fly, fly!\" cried Akka, for she knew that\notherwise the swans would pull out every feather the goosey-gander had.\n\n\"Fly, fly!\" screamed Thumbietot, too.\n\nBut the goosey-gander was so hedged in by the swans that he had not\nroom enough to spread his wings. All around him the swans stretched\ntheir long necks, opened their strong bills, and plucked his feathers.\n\nMorten Goosey-Gander defended himself as best he could, by striking and\nbiting. The wild geese also began to fight the swans.\n\nIt was obvious how this would have ended had the geese not received help\nquite unexpectedly.\n\nA red-tail noticed that they were being roughly treated by the swans.\nInstantly he cried out the shrill call that little birds use when they\nneed help to drive off a hawk or a falcon.\n\nThree calls had barely sounded when all the little birds in the vicinity\ncame shooting down to Hj\u00c3\u00a4lsta Bay, as if on wings of lightning.\n\nThese delicate little creatures swooped down upon the swans, screeched\nin their ears, and obstructed their view with the flutter of their tiny\nwings. They made them dizzy with their fluttering and drove them to\ndistraction with their cries of \"Shame, shame, swans!\"\n\nThe attack of the small birds lasted but a moment. When they were gone\nand the swans came to their senses, they saw that the geese had risen\nand flown over to the other end of the bay.\n\nTHE NEW WATCH-DOG\n\nThere was this at least to be said in the swans' favour--when they saw\nthat the wild geese had escaped, they were too proud to chase them.\nMoreover, the geese could stand on a clump of reeds with perfect\ncomposure, and sleep.\n\nNils Holgersson was too hungry to sleep.\n\n\"It is necessary for me to get something to eat,\" he said.\n\nAt that time, when all kinds of things were floating on the water, it\nwas not difficult for a little boy like Nils Holgersson to find a craft.\nHe did not stop to deliberate, but hopped down on a stump that had\ndrifted in amongst the reeds. Then he picked up a little stick and began\nto pole toward shore.\n\nJust as he was landing, he heard a splash in the water. He stopped\nshort. First he saw a lady swan asleep in her big nest quite close to\nhim, then he noticed that a fox had taken a few steps into the water and\nwas sneaking up to the swan's nest.\n\n\"Hi, hi, hi! Get up, get up!\" cried the boy, beating the water with his\nstick.\n\nThe lady swan rose, but not so quickly but that the fox could have\npounced upon her had he cared to. However, he refrained and instead\nhurried straight toward the boy.\n\nThumbietot saw the fox coming and ran for his life.\n\nWide stretches of meadow land spread before him. He saw no tree that he\ncould climb, no hole where he might hide; he just had to keep running.\n\nThe boy was a good runner, but it stands to reason that he could not\nrace with a fox!\n\nNot far from the bay there were a number of little cabins, with candle\nlights shining through the windows. Naturally the boy ran in that\ndirection, but he realized that long before he could reach the nearest\ncabin the fox would catch up to him.\n\nOnce the fox was so close that it looked as if the boy would surely be\nhis prey, but Nils quickly sprang aside and turned back toward the bay.\nBy that move the fox lost time, and before he could reach the boy the\nlatter had run up to two men who were on their way home from work.\n\nThe men were tired and sleepy; they had noticed neither boy nor fox,\nalthough both had been running right in front of them. Nor did the boy\nask help of the men; he was content to walk close beside them.\n\n\"Surely the fox won't venture to come up to the men,\" he thought.\n\nBut presently the fox came pattering along. He probably counted on the\nmen taking him for a dog, for he went straight up to them.\n\n\"Whose dog can that be sneaking around here?\" queried one. \"He looks as\nthough he were ready to bite.\"\n\nThe other paused and glanced back.\n\n\"Go along with you!\" he said, and gave the fox a kick that sent it to\nthe opposite side of the road. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nAfter that the fox kept at a safe distance, but followed all the while.\n\nPresently the men reached a cabin and entered it. The boy intended to go\nin with them; but when he got to the stoop he saw a big, shaggy\nwatch-dog rush out from his kennel to greet his master. Suddenly the boy\nchanged his mind and remained out in the open.\n\n\"Listen, watch-dog!\" whispered the boy as soon as the men had shut the\ndoor. \"I wonder if you would like to help me catch a fox to-night?\"\n\nThe dog had poor eyesight and had become irritable and cranky from being\nchained.\n\n\"What, I catch a fox?\" he barked angrily. \"Who are you that makes fun of\nme? You just come within my reach and I'll teach you not to fool with\nme!\"\n\n\"You needn't think that I'm afraid to come near you!\" said the boy,\nrunning up to the dog.\n\nWhen the dog saw him he was so astonished that he could not speak.\n\n\"I'm the one they call Thumbietot, who travels with the wild geese,\"\nsaid the boy, introducing himself. \"Haven't you heard of me?\"\n\n\"I believe the sparrows have twittered a little about you,\" the dog\nreturned. \"They say that you have done wonderful things for one of your\nsize.\"\n\n\"I've been rather lucky up to the present,\" admitted the boy. \"But now\nit's all up with me unless you help me! There's a fox at my heels. He's\nlying in wait for me around the corner.\"\n\n\"Don't you suppose I can smell him?\" retorted the dog. \"But we'll soon\nbe rid of him!\" With that the dog sprang as far as the chain would\nallow, barking and growling for ever so long. \"Now I don't think he will\nshow his face again to-night!\" said the dog.\n\n\"It will take something besides a fine bark to scare that fox!\" the boy\nremarked. \"He'll soon be here again, and that is precisely what I wish,\nfor I have set my heart on your catching him.\"\n\n\"Are you poking fun at me now?\" asked the dog.\n\n\"Only come with me into your kennel, and I'll tell you what to do.\"\n\nThe boy and the watch-dog crept into the kennel and crouched there,\nwhispering.\n\nBy and by the fox stuck his nose out from his hiding place. When all was\nquiet he crept along cautiously. He scented the boy all the way to the\nkennel, but halted at a safe distance and sat down to think of some way\nto coax him out.\n\nSuddenly the watch-dog poked his head out and growled at him:\n\n\"Go away, or I'll catch you!\"\n\n\"I'll sit here as long as I please for all of you!\" defied the fox.\n\n\"Go away!\" repeated the dog threateningly, \"or there will be no more\nhunting for you after to-night.\"\n\nBut the fox only grinned and did not move an inch.\n\n\"I know how far your chain can reach,\" he said.\n\n\"I have warned you twice,\" said the dog, coming out from his kennel.\n\"Now blame yourself!\"\n\nWith that the dog sprang at the fox and caught him without the least\neffort, for he was loose. The boy had unbuckled his collar.\n\nThere was a hot struggle, but it was soon over. The dog was the victor.\nThe fox lay on the ground and dared not move.\n\n\"Don't stir or I'll kill you!\" snarled the dog. Then he took the fox by\nthe scruff of the neck and dragged him to the kennel. There the boy was\nready with the chain. He placed the dog collar around the neck of the\nfox, tightening it so that he was securely chained. During all this the\nfox had to lie still, for he was afraid to move.\n\n\"Now, Smirre Fox, I hope you'll make a good watch-dog,\" laughed the boy\nwhen he had finished.\n\n\nDUNFIN\n\n\nTHE CITY THAT FLOATS ON THE WATER\n\n_Friday, May sixth_.\n\nNo one could be more gentle and kind than the little gray goose Dunfin.\nAll the wild geese loved her, and the tame white goosey-gander would\nhave died for her. When Dunfin asked for anything not even Akka could\nsay no.\n\nAs soon as Dunfin came to Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar the landscape looked familiar to\nher. Just beyond the lake lay the sea, with many wooded islands, and\nthere, on a little islet, lived her parents and her brothers and\nsisters. She begged the wild geese to fly to her home before travelling\nfarther north, that she might let her family see that she was still\nalive. It would be such a joy to them.\n\nAkka frankly declared that she thought Dunfin's parents and brothers and\nsisters had shown no great love for her when they abandoned her at\n\u00c3\u0096land, but Dunfin would not admit that Akka was in the right. \"What else\nwas there to do, when they saw that I could not fly?\" she protested.\n\"Surely they couldn't remain at \u00c3\u0096land on my account!\"\n\nDunfin began telling the wild geese all about her home in the\narchipelago, to try to induce them to make the trip. Her family lived on\na rock island. Seen from a distance, there appeared to be nothing but\nstone there; but when one came closer, there were to be found the\nchoicest goose tidbits in clefts and hollows, and one might search long\nfor better nesting places than those that were hidden in the mountain\ncrevices or among the osier bushes. But the best of all was the old\nfisherman who lived there. Dunfin had heard that in his youth he had\nbeen a great shot and had always lain in the offing and hunted birds.\nBut now, in his old age--since his wife had died and the children had\ngone from home, so that he was alone in the hut--he had begun to care\nfor the birds on his island. He never fired a shot at them, nor would he\npermit others to do so. He walked around amongst the birds' nests, and\nwhen the mother birds were sitting he brought them food. Not one was\nafraid of him. They all loved him.\n\nDunfin had been in his hut many times, and he had fed her with bread\ncrumbs. Because he was kind to the birds, they flocked to his island in\nsuch great numbers that it was becoming overcrowded. If one happened to\narrive a little late in the spring, all the nesting places were\noccupied. That was why Dunfin's family had been obliged to leave her.\n\nDunfin begged so hard that she finally had her way, although the wild\ngeese felt that they were losing time and really should be going\nstraight north. But a little trip like this to the cliff island would\nnot delay them more than a day.\n\nSo they started off one morning, after fortifying themselves with a good\nbreakfast, and flew eastward over Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar. The boy did not know for\ncertain where they were going; but he noticed that the farther east they\nflew, the livelier it was on the lake and the more built up were the\nshores.\n\nHeavily freighted barges and sloops, boats and fishing smacks were on\ntheir way east, and these were met and passed by many pretty white\nsteamers. Along the shores ran country roads and railway tracks--all in\nthe same direction. There was some place beyond in the east where all\nwished to go to in the morning.\n\nOn one of the islands the boy saw a big, white castle, and to the east\nof it the shores were dotted with villas. At the start these lay far\napart, then they became closer and closer, and, presently, the whole\nshore was lined with them. They were of every variety--here a castle,\nthere a cottage; then a low manor house appeared, or a mansion, with\nmany small towers. Some stood in gardens, but most of them were in the\nwild woods which bordered the shores. Despite their dissimilarity, they\nhad one point of resemblance--they were not plain and sombre-looking,\nlike other buildings, but were gaudily painted in striking greens and\nblues, reds and white, like children's playhouses.\n\nAs the boy sat on the goose's back and glanced down at the curious shore\nmansions, Dunfin cried out with delight: \"Now I know where I am! Over\nthere lies the City that Floats on the Water.\"\n\nThe boy looked ahead. At first he saw nothing but some light clouds and\nmists rolling forward over the water, but soon he caught sight of some\ntall spires, and then one and another house with many rows of windows.\nThey appeared and disappeared--rolling hither and thither--but not a\nstrip of shore did he see! Everything over there appeared to be resting\non the water.\n\nNearer to the city he saw no more pretty playhouses along the\nshores--only dingy factories. Great heaps of coal and wood were stacked\nbehind tall planks, and alongside black, sooty docks lay bulky freight\nsteamers; but over all was spread a shimmering, transparent mist, which\nmade everything appear so big and strong and wonderful that it was\nalmost beautiful.\n\nThe wild geese flew past factories and freight steamers and were\nnearing the cloud-enveloped spires. Suddenly all the mists sank to the\nwater, save the thin, fleecy ones that circled above their heads,\nbeautifully tinted in blues and pinks. The other clouds rolled over\nwater and land. They entirely obscured the lower portions of the houses:\nonly the upper stories and the roofs and gables were visible. Some of\nthe buildings appeared to be as high as the Tower of Babel. The boy no\ndoubt knew that they were built upon hills and mountains, but these he\ndid not see--only the houses that seemed to float among the white,\ndrifting clouds. In reality the buildings were dark and dingy, for the\nsun in the east was not shining on them.\n\nThe boy knew that he was riding above a large city, for he saw spires\nand house roofs rising from the clouds in every direction. Sometimes an\nopening was made in the circling mists, and he looked down into a\nrunning, tortuous stream; but no land could he see. All this was\nbeautiful to look upon, but he felt quite distraught--as one does when\nhappening upon something one cannot understand.\n\nWhen he had gone beyond the city, he found that the ground was no longer\nhidden by clouds, but that shores, streams, and islands were again\nplainly visible. He turned to see the city better, but could not, for\nnow it looked quite enchanted. The mists had taken on colour from the\nsunshine and were rolling forward in the most brilliant reds, blues, and\nyellows. The houses were white, as if built of light, and the windows\nand spires sparkled like fire. All things floated on the water as\nbefore.\n\nThe geese were travelling straight east. They flew over factories and\nworkshops; then over mansions edging the shores. Steamboats and tugs\nswarmed on the water; but now they came from the east and were steaming\nwestward toward the city.\n\nThe wild geese flew on, but instead of the narrow M\u00c3\u00a4lar fiords and the\nlittle islands, broader waters and larger islands spread under them. At\nlast the land was left behind and seen no more.\n\nThey flew still farther out, where they found no more large inhabited\nislands--only numberless little rock islands were scattered on the\nwater. Now the fiords were not crowded by the land. The sea lay before\nthem, vast and limitless.\n\nHere the wild geese alighted on a cliff island, and as soon as their\nfeet touched the ground the boy turned to Dunfin.\n\n\"What city did we fly over just now?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know what human beings have named it,\" said Dunfin. \"We gray\ngeese call it the 'City that Floats on the Water'.\"\n\nTHE SISTERS\n\nDunfin had two sisters, Prettywing and Goldeye. They were strong and\nintelligent birds, but they did not have such a soft and shiny feather\ndress as Dunfin, nor did they have her sweet and gentle disposition.\nFrom the time they had been little, yellow goslings, their parents and\nrelatives and even the old fisherman had plainly shown them that they\nthought more of Dunfin than of them. Therefore the sisters had always\nhated her.\n\nWhen the wild geese landed on the cliff island, Prettywing and Goldeye\nwere feeding on a bit of grass close to the strand, and immediately\ncaught sight of the strangers.\n\n\"See, Sister Goldeye, what fine-looking geese have come to our island!\"\nexclaimed Prettywing, \"I have rarely seen such graceful birds. Do you\nnotice that they have a white goosey-gander among them? Did you ever set\neyes on a handsomer bird? One could almost take him for a swan!\"\n\nGoldeye agreed with her sister that these were certainly very\ndistinguished strangers that had come to the island, but suddenly she\nbroke off and called: \"Sister Prettywing! Oh, Sister Prettywing! Don't\nyou see whom they bring with them?\"\n\nPrettywing also caught sight of Dunfin and was so astounded that she\nstood for a long time with her bill wide open, and only hissed.\n\n\"It can't be possible that it is she! How did she manage to get in with\npeople of that class? Why, we left her at \u00c3\u0096land to freeze and starve.\"\n\n\"The worse of it is she will tattle to father and mother that we flew\nso close to her that we knocked her wing out of joint,\" said Goldeye.\n\"You'll see that it will end in our being driven from the island!\"\n\n\"We have nothing but trouble in store for us, now that that young one\nhas come back!\" snapped Prettywing. \"Still I think it would be best for\nus to appear as pleased as possible over her return. She is so stupid\nthat perhaps she didn't even notice that we gave her a push on purpose.\"\n\nWhile Prettywing and Goldeye were talking in this strain, the wild geese\nhad been standing on the strand, pluming their feathers after the\nflight. Now they marched in a long line up the rocky shore to the cleft\nwhere Dunfin's parents usually stopped.\n\nDunfin's parents were good folk. They had lived on the island longer\nthan any one else, and it was their habit to counsel and aid all\nnewcomers. They too had seen the geese approach, but they had not\nrecognized Dunfin in the flock.\n\n\"It is strange to see wild geese land on this island,\" remarked the\ngoose-master. \"It is a fine flock--that one can see by their flight.\"\n\n\"But it won't be easy to find pasturage for so many,\" said the\ngoose-wife, who was gentle and sweet-tempered, like Dunfin.\n\nWhen Akka came marching with her company, Dunfin's parents went out to\nmeet her and welcome her to the island. Dunfin flew from her place at\nthe end of the line and lit between her parents.\n\n\"Mother and father, I'm here at last!\" she cried joyously. \"Don't you\nknow Dunfin?\"\n\nAt first the old goose-parents could not quite make out what they saw,\nbut when they recognized Dunfin they were absurdly happy, of course.\n\nWhile the wild geese and Morten Goosey-Gander and Dunfin were chattering\nexcitedly, trying to tell how she had been rescued, Prettywing and\nGoldeye came running. They cried \"_welcome\"_ and pretended to be so\nhappy because Dunfin was at home that she was deeply moved.\n\nThe wild geese fared well on the island and decided not to travel\nfarther until the following morning. After a while the sisters asked\nDunfin if she would come with them and see the places where they\nintended to build their nests. She promptly accompanied them, and saw\nthat they had picked out secluded and well protected nesting places.\n\n\"Now where will you settle down, Dunfin?\" they asked.\n\n\"I? Why I don't intend to remain on the island,\" she said. \"I'm going\nwith the wild geese up to Lapland.\"\n\n\"What a pity that you must leave us!\" said the sisters.\n\n\"I should have been very glad to remain here with father and mother and\nyou,\" said Dunfin, \"had I not promised the big, white--\"\n\n\"What!\" shrieked Prettywing. \"Are you to have the handsome\ngoosey-gander? Then it is--\" But here Goldeye gave her a sharp nudge,\nand she stopped short.\n\nThe two cruel sisters had much to talk about all the afternoon. They\nwere furious because Dunfin had a suitor like the white goosey-gander.\nThey themselves had suitors, but theirs were only common gray geese,\nand, since they had seen Morten Goosey-Gander, they thought them so\nhomely and low-bred that they did not wish even to look at them.\n\n\"This will grieve me to death!\" whimpered Goldeye. \"If at least it had\nbeen you, Sister Prettywing, who had captured him!\"\n\n\"I would rather see him dead than to go about here the entire summer\nthinking of Dunfin's capturing a white goosey-gander!\" pouted\nPrettywing.\n\nHowever, the sisters continued to appear very friendly toward Dunfin,\nand in the afternoon Goldeye took Dunfin with her, that she might see\nthe one she thought of marrying.\n\n\"He's not as attractive as the one you will have,\" said Goldeye. \"But to\nmake up for it, one can be certain that he is what he is.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Goldeye?\" questioned Dunfin. At first Goldeye would\nnot explain what she had meant, but at last she came out with it.\n\n\"We have never seen a white goose travel with wild geese,\" said the\nsister, \"and we wonder if he can be bewitched.\"\n\n\"You are very stupid,\" retorted Dunfin indignantly. \"He is a tame goose,\nof course.\"\n\n\"He brings with him one who is bewitched,\" said Goldeye, \"and, under the\ncircumstances, he too must be bewitched. Are you not afraid that he may\nbe a black cormorant?\" She was a good talker and succeeded in\nfrightening Dunfin thoroughly.\n\n\"You don't mean what you are saying,\" pleaded the little gray goose.\n\"You only wish to frighten me!\"\n\n\"I wish what is for your good, Dunfin,\" said Goldeye. \"I can't imagine\nanything worse than for you to fly away with a black cormorant! But now\nI shall tell you something--try to persuade him to eat some of the roots\nI have gathered here. If he is bewitched, it will be apparent at once.\nIf he is not, he will remain as he is.\"\n\nThe boy was sitting amongst the wild geese, listening to Akka and the\nold goose-master, when Dunfin came flying up to him. \"Thumbietot,\nThumbietot!\" she cried. \"Morten Goosey-Gander is dying! I have killed\nhim!\"\n\n\"Let me get up on your back, Dunfin, and take me to him!\" Away they\nflew, and Akka and the other wild geese followed them. When they got to\nthe goosey-gander, he was lying prostrate on the ground. He could not\nutter a word--only gasped for breath.\n\n\"Tickle him under the gorge and slap him on the back!\" commanded Akka.\nThe boy did so and presently the big, white gander coughed up a large,\nwhite root, which had stuck in his gorge. \"Have you been eating of\nthese?\" asked Akka, pointing to some roots that lay on the ground.\n\n\"Yes,\" groaned the goosey-gander.\n\n\"Then it was well they stuck in your throat,\" said Akka, \"for they are\npoisonous. Had you swallowed them, you certainly should have died.\"\n\n\"Dunfin bade me eat them,\" said the goosey-gander.\n\n\"My sister gave them to me,\" protested Dunfin, and she told everything.\n\n\"You must beware of those sisters of yours, Dunfin!\" warned Akka, \"for\nthey wish you no good, depend upon it!\"\n\nBut Dunfin was so constituted that she could not think evil of any one\nand, a moment later, when Prettywing asked her to come and meet her\nintended, she went with her immediately.\n\n\"Oh, he isn't as handsome as yours,\" said the sister, \"but he's much\nmore courageous and daring!\"\n\n\"How do you know he is?\" challenged Dunfin.\n\n\"For some time past there has been weeping and wailing amongst the sea\ngulls and wild ducks on the island. Every morning at daybreak a strange\nbird of prey comes and carries off one of them.\"\n\n\"What kind of a bird is it?\" asked Dunfin.\n\n\"We don't know,\" replied the sister. \"One of his kind has never before\nbeen seen on the island, and, strange to say, he has never attacked one\nof us geese. But now my intended has made up his mind to challenge him\nto-morrow morning, and drive him away.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope he'll succeed!\" said Dunfin.\n\n\"I hardly think he will,\" returned the sister. \"If my goosey-gander were\nas big and strong as yours, I should have hope.\"\n\n\"Do you wish me to ask Morten Goosey-Gander to meet the strange bird?\"\nasked Dunfin.\n\n\"Indeed, I do!\" exclaimed Prettywing excitedly. \"You couldn't render me\na greater service.\"\n\nThe next morning the goosey-gander was up before the sun. He stationed\nhimself on the highest point of the island and peered in all directions.\nPresently he saw a big, dark bird coming from the west. His wings were\nexceedingly large, and it was easy to tell that he was an eagle. The\ngoosey-gander had not expected a more dangerous adversary than an owl,\nand how he understood that he could not escape this encounter with his\nlife. But it did not occur to him to avoid a struggle with a bird who\nwas many times stronger than himself.\n\nThe great bird swooped down on a sea gull and dug his talons into it.\nBefore the eagle could spread his wings, Morten Goosey-Gander rushed up\nto him. \"Drop that!\" he shouted, \"and don't come here again or you'll\nhave me to deal with!\" \"What kind of a lunatic are you?\" said the eagle.\n\"It's lucky for you that I never fight with geese, or you would soon be\ndone for!\"\n\nMorten Goosey-Gander thought the eagle considered himself too good to\nfight with him and flew at him, incensed, biting him on the throat and\nbeating him with his wings. This, naturally, the eagle would not\ntolerate and he began to fight, but not with his full strength.\n\nThe boy lay sleeping in the quarters where Akka and the other wild geese\nslept, when Dunfin called: \"Thumbietot, Thumbietot! Morten Goosey-Gander\nis being torn to pieces by an eagle.\"\n\n\"Let me get up on your back, Dunfin, and take me to him!\" said the boy.\n\nWhen they arrived on the scene Morten Goosey-Gander was badly torn, and\nbleeding, but he was still fighting. The boy could not battle with the\neagle; all that he could do was to seek more efficient help.\n\n\"Hurry, Dunfin, and call Akka and the wild geese!\" he cried. The instant\nhe said that, the eagle flew back and stopped fighting.\n\n\"Who's speaking of Akka?\" he asked. He saw Thumbietot and heard the wild\ngeese honking, so he spread his wings.\n\n\"Tell Akka I never expected to run across her or any of her flock out\nhere in the sea!\" he said, and soared away in a rapid and graceful\nflight.\n\n\"That is the self-same eagle who once brought me back to the wild\ngeese,\" the boy remarked, gazing after the bird in astonishment.\n\nThe geese had decided to leave the island at dawn, but first they wanted\nto feed awhile. As they walked about and nibbled, a mountain duck came\nup to Dunfin.\n\n\"I have a message for you from your sisters,\" said the duck. \"They dare\nnot show themselves among the wild geese, but they asked me to remind\nyou not to leave the island without calling on the old fisherman.\"\n\n\"That's so!\" exclaimed Dunfin, but she was so frightened now that she\nwould not go alone, and asked the goosey-gander and Thumbietot to\naccompany her to the hut.\n\nThe door was open, so Dunfin entered, but the others remained outside.\nAfter a moment they heard Akka give the signal to start, and called\nDunfin. A gray goose came out and flew with the wild geese away from the\nisland.\n\nThey had travelled quite a distance along the archipelago when the boy\nbegan to wonder at the goose who accompanied them. Dunfin always flew\nlightly and noiselessly, but this one laboured with heavy and noisy\nwing-strokes. \"We are in the wrong company. It is Prettywing that\nfollows us!\"\n\nThe boy had barely spoken when the goose uttered such an ugly and angry\nshriek that all knew who she was. Akka and the others turned to her, but\nthe gray goose did not fly away at once. Instead she bumped against the\nbig goosey-gander, snatched Thumbietot, and flew off with him in her\nbill.\n\nThere was a wild chase over the archipelago. Prettywing flew fast, but\nthe wild geese were close behind her, and there was no chance for her to\nescape.\n\nSuddenly they saw a puff of smoke rise up from the sea, and heard an\nexplosion. In their excitement they had not noticed that they were\ndirectly above a boat in which a lone fisherman was seated.\n\nHowever, none of the geese was hurt; but just there, above the boat,\nPrettywing opened her bill and dropped Thumbietot into the sea.\n\n\nSTOCKHOLM\n\n\nSKANSEN\n\nA few years ago, at Skansen--the great park just outside of Stockholm\nwhere they have collected so many wonderful things--there lived a little\nold man, named Clement Larsson. He was from H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland and had come to\nSkansen with his fiddle to play folk dances and other old melodies. As a\nperformer, he appeared mostly in the evening. During the day it was his\nbusiness to sit on guard in one of the many pretty peasant cottages\nwhich have been moved to Skansen from all parts of the country.\n\nIn the beginning Clement thought that he fared better in his old age\nthan he had ever dared dream; but after a time he began to dislike the\nplace terribly, especially while he was on watch duty. It was all very\nwell when visitors came into the cottage to look around, but some days\nClement would sit for many hours all alone. Then he felt so homesick\nthat he feared he would have to give up his place. He was very poor and\nknew that at home he would become a charge on the parish. Therefore he\ntried to hold out as long as he could, although he felt more unhappy\nfrom day to day.\n\nOne beautiful evening in the beginning of May Clement had been granted a\nfew hours' leave of absence. He was on his way down the steep hill\nleading out of Skansen, when he met an island fisherman coming along\nwith his game bag. The fisherman was an active young man who came to\nSkansen with seafowl that he had managed to capture alive. Clement had\nmet him before, many times.\n\nThe fisherman stopped Clement to ask if the superintendent at Skansen\nwas at home. When Clement had replied, he, in turn, asked what choice\nthing the fisherman had in his bag. \"You can see what I have,\" the\nfisherman answered, \"if in return you will give me an idea as to what I\nshould ask for it.\"\n\nHe held open the bag and Clement peeped into it once--and again--then\nquickly drew back a step or two. \"Good gracious, Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn!\" he\nexclaimed. \"How did you catch that one?\"\n\nHe remembered that when he was a child his mother used to talk of the\ntiny folk who lived under the cabin floor. He was not permitted to cry\nor to be naughty, lest he provoke these small people. After he was grown\nhe believed his mother had made up these stories about the elves to make\nhim behave himself. But it had been no invention of his mother's, it\nseemed; for there, in Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn's bag, lay one of the tiny folk.\n\nThere was a little of the terror natural to childhood left in Clement,\nand he felt a shudder run down his spinal column as he peeped into the\nbag. Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn saw that he was frightened and began to laugh; but\nClement took the matter seriously. \"Tell me, Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn, where you came\nacross him?\" he asked. \"You may be sure that I wasn't lying in wait for\nhim!\" said Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn. \"He came to me. I started out early this morning\nand took my rifle along into the boat. I had just poled away from the\nshore when I sighted some wild geese coming from the east, shrieking\nlike mad. I sent them a shot, but hit none of them. Instead this\ncreature came tumbling down into the water--so close to the boat that I\nonly had to put my hand out and pick him up.\"\n\n\"I hope you didn't shoot him, Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! He is well and sound; but when he came down, he was a little\ndazed at first, so I took advantage of that fact to wind the ends of two\nsail threads around his ankles and wrists, so that he couldn't run away.\n'Ha! Here's something for Skansen,' I thought instantly.\"\n\nClement grew strangely troubled as the fisherman talked. All that he had\nheard about the tiny folk in his childhood--of their vindictiveness\ntoward enemies and their benevolence toward friends--came back to him.\nIt had never gone well with those who had attempted to hold one of them\ncaptive.\n\n\"You should have let him go at once, Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn,\" said Clement.\n\n\"I came precious near being forced to set him free,\" returned the\nfisherman. \"You may as well know, Clement, that the wild geese followed\nme all the way home, and they criss-crossed over the island the whole\nmorning, honk-honking as if they wanted him back. Not only they, but the\nentire population--sea gulls, sea swallows, and many others who are not\nworth a shot of powder, alighted on the island and made an awful racket.\nWhen I came out they fluttered about me until I had to turn back. My\nwife begged me to let him go, but I had made up my mind that he should\ncome here to Skansen, so I placed one of the children's dolls in the\nwindow, hid the midget in the bottom of my bag, and started away. The\nbirds must have fancied that it was he who stood in the window, for they\npermitted me to leave without pursuing me.\"\n\n\"Does it say anything?\" asked Clement.\n\n\"Yes. At first he tried to call to the birds, but I wouldn't have it and\nput a gag in his mouth.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn!\" protested Clement. \"How can you treat him so! Don't you\nsee that he is something supernatural!\"\n\n\"I don't know what he is,\" said Ashbj\u00c3\u00b6rn calmly. \"Let others consider\nthat. I'm satisfied if only I can get a good sum for him. Now tell me,\nClement, what you think the doctor at Skansen would give me.\"\n\nThere was a long pause before Clement replied. He felt very sorry for\nthe poor little chap. He actually imagined that his mother was standing\nbeside him telling him that he must always be kind to the tiny folk.\n\n\"I have no idea what the doctor up there would care to give you,\nAshbj\u00c3\u00b6rn,\" he said finally. \"But if you will leave him with me, I'll pay\nyou twenty kroner for him.\"\n\nAshbj\u00c3\u00b6rn stared at the fiddler in amazement when he heard him name so\nlarge a sum. He thought that Clement believed the midget had some\nmysterious power and might be of service for him. He was by no means\ncertain that the doctor would think him such a great find or would offer\nto pay so high a sum for him; so he accepted Clement's proffer.\n\nThe fiddler poked his purchase into one of his wide pockets, turned back\nto Skansen, and went into a moss-covered hut, where there were neither\nvisitors nor guards. He closed the door after him, took out the midget,\nwho was still bound hand and foot and gagged, and laid him down gently\non a bench.\n\n\"Now listen to what I say!\" said Clement. \"I know of course that such as\nyou do not like to be seen of men, but prefer to go about and busy\nyourselves in your own way. Therefore I have decided to give you your\nliberty--but only on condition that you will remain in this park until I\npermit you to leave. If you agree to this, nod your head three times.\"\n\nClement gazed at the midget with confident expectation, but the latter\ndid not move a muscle.\n\n\"You shall not fare badly,\" continued Clement. \"I'll see to it that you\nare fed every day, and you will have so much to do there that the time\nwill not seem long to you. But you mustn't go elsewhere till I give you\nleave. Now we'll agree as to a signal. So long as I set your food out in\na white bowl you are to stay. When I set it out in a blue one you may\ngo.\"\n\nClement paused again, expecting the midget to give the sign of approval,\nbut he did not stir.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Clement, \"then there's no choice but to show you to\nthe master of this place. Then you'll be put in a glass case, and all\nthe people in the big city of Stockholm will come and stare at you.\"\n\nThis scared the midget, and he promptly gave the signal.\n\n\"That was right,\" said Clement as he cut the cord that bound the\nmidget's hands. Then he hurried toward the door.\n\nThe boy unloosed the bands around his ankles and tore away the gag\nbefore thinking of anything else. When he turned to Clement to thank\nhim, he had gone.\n\nJust outside the door Clement met a handsome, noble-looking gentleman,\nwho was on his way to a place close by from which there was a beautiful\noutlook. Clement could not recall having seen the stately old man\nbefore, but the latter must surely have noticed Clement sometime when he\nwas playing the fiddle, because he stopped and spoke to him.\n\n\"Good day, Clement!\" he said. \"How do you do? You are not ill, are you?\nI think you have grown a bit thin of late.\"\n\nThere was such an expression of kindliness about the old gentleman that\nClement plucked up courage and told him of his homesickness.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the old gentleman. \"Are you homesick when you are in\nStockholm? It can't be possible!\" He looked almost offended. Then he\nreflected that it was only an ignorant old peasant from H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland that\nhe talked with--and so resumed his friendly attitude.\n\n\"Surely you have never heard how the city of Stockholm was founded? If\nyou had, you would comprehend that your anxiety to get away is only a\nfoolish fancy. Come with me to the bench over yonder and I will tell you\nsomething about Stockholm.\"\n\nWhen the old gentleman was seated on the bench he glanced down at the\ncity, which spread in all its glory below him, and he drew a deep\nbreath, as if he wished to drink in all the beauty of the landscape.\nThereupon he turned to the fiddler.\n\n\"Look, Clement!\" he said, and as he talked he traced with his cane a\nlittle map in the sand in front of them. \"Here lies Uppland, and here,\nto the south, a point juts out, which is split up by a number of bays.\nAnd here we have S\u00c3\u00b6rmland with another point, which is just as cut up\nand points straight north. Here, from the west, comes a lake filled with\nislands: It is Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar. From the east comes another body of water,\nwhich can barely squeeze in between the islands and islets. It is the\nEast Sea. Here, Clement, where Uppland joins S\u00c3\u00b6rmland and M\u00c3\u00a4laren joins\nthe East Sea, comes a short river, in the centre of which lie four\nlittle islets that divide the river into several tributaries--one of\nwhich is called Norristr\u00c3\u00b6m but was formerly Stocksund.\n\n\"In the beginning these islets were common wooded islands, such as one\nfinds in plenty on Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar even to-day, and for ages they were\nentirely uninhabited. They were well located between two bodies of water\nand two bodies of land; but this no one remarked. Year after year\npassed; people settled along Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar and in the archipelago, but\nthese river islands attracted no settlers. Sometimes it happened that a\nseafarer put into port at one of them and pitched his tent for the\nnight; but no one remained there long.\n\n\"One day a fisherman, who lived on Liding Island, out in Salt Fiord,\nsteered his boat toward Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar, where he had such good luck with his\nfishing that he forgot to start for home in time. He got no farther than\nthe four islets, and the best he could do was to land on one and wait\nuntil later in the night, when there would be bright moonlight.\n\n\"It was late summer and warm. The fisherman hauled his boat on land, lay\ndown beside it, his head resting upon a stone, and fell asleep. When he\nawoke the moon had been up a long while. It hung right above him and\nshone with such splendour that it was like broad daylight.\n\n\"The man jumped to his feet and was about to push his boat into the\nwater, when he saw a lot of black specks moving out in the stream. A\nschool of seals was heading full speed for the island. When the\nfisherman saw that they intended to crawl up on land, he bent down for\nhis spear, which he always took with him in the boat. But when he\nstraightened up, he saw no seals. Instead, there stood on the strand the\nmost beautiful young maidens, dressed in green, trailing satin robes,\nwith pearl crowns upon their heads. The fisherman understood that these\nwere mermaids who lived on desolate rock islands far out at sea and had\nassumed seal disguises in order to come up on land and enjoy the\nmoonlight on the green islets.\n\n\"He laid down the spear very cautiously, and when the young maidens came\nup on the island to play, he stole behind and surveyed them. He had\nheard that sea-nymphs were so beautiful and fascinating that no one\ncould see them and not be enchanted by their charms; and he had to admit\nthat this was not too much to say of them.\n\n\"When he had stood for a while under the shadow of the trees and watched\nthe dance, he went down to the strand, took one of the seal skins lying\nthere, and hid it under a stone. Then he went back to his boat, lay down\nbeside it, and pretended to be asleep.\n\n\"Presently he saw the young maidens trip down to the strand to don their\nseal skins. At first all was play and laughter, which was changed to\nweeping and wailing when one of the mermaids could not find her seal\nrobe. Her companions ran up and down the strand and helped her search\nfor it, but no trace could they find. While they were seeking they\nnoticed that the sky was growing pale and the day was breaking, so they\ncould tarry no longer, and they all swam away, leaving behind the one\nwhose seal skin was missing. She sat on the strand and wept.\n\n\"The fisherman felt sorry for her, of course, but he forced himself to\nlie still till daybreak. Then he got up, pushed the boat into the water,\nand stepped into it to make it appear that he saw her by chance after he\nhad lifted the oars.\n\n\"'Who are you?' he called out. 'Are you shipwrecked?'\n\n\"She ran toward him and asked if he had seen her seal skin. The\nfisherman looked as if he did not know what she was talking about. She\nsat down again and wept. Then he determined to take her with him in the\nboat. 'Come with me to my cottage,' he commanded, 'and my mother will\ntake care of you. You can't stay here on the island, where you have\nneither food nor shelter!' He talked so convincingly that she was\npersuaded to step into his boat.\n\n\"Both the fisherman and his mother were very kind to the poor mermaid,\nand she seemed to be happy with them. She grew more contented every day\nand helped the older woman with her work, and was exactly like any other\nisland lass--only she was much prettier. One day the fisherman asked her\nif she would be his wife, and she did not object, but at once said yes.\n\n\"Preparations were made for the wedding. The mermaid dressed as a bride\nin her green, trailing robe with the shimmering pearl crown she had worn\nwhen the fisherman first saw her. There was neither church nor parson on\nthe island at that time, so the bridal party seated themselves in the\nboats to row up to the first church they should find.\n\n\"The fisherman had the mermaid and his mother in his boat, and he rowed\nso well that he was far ahead of all the others. When he had come so far\nthat he could see the islet in the river, where he won his bride, he\ncould not help smiling.\n\n\"'What are you smiling at?' she asked.\n\n\"'Oh, I'm thinking of that night when I hid your seal skin,' answered\nthe fisherman; for he felt so sure of her that he thought there was no\nlonger any need for him to conceal anything.\n\n\"'What are you saying?' asked the bride, astonished. 'Surely I have\nnever possessed a seal skin!' It appeared she had forgotten everything.\n\n\"'Don't you recollect how you danced with the mermaids?' he asked.\n\n\"'I don't know what you mean,' said the bride. 'I think that you must\nhave dreamed a strange dream last night.'\n\n\"If I show you your seal skin, you'll probably believe me!' laughed the\nfisherman, promptly turning the boat toward the islet. They stepped\nashore and he brought the seal skin out from under the stone where he\nhad hidden it.\n\n\"But the instant the bride set eyes on the seal skin she grasped it and\ndrew it over her head. It snuggled close to her--as if there was life in\nit--and immediately she threw herself into the stream.\n\n\"The bridegroom saw her swim away and plunged into the water after her;\nbut he could not catch up to her. When he saw that he couldn't stop her\nin any other way, in his grief he seized his spear and hurled it. He\naimed better than he had intended, for the poor mermaid gave a piercing\nshriek and disappeared in the depths.\n\n\"The fisherman stood on the strand waiting for her to appear again. He\nobserved that the water around him began to take on a soft sheen, a\nbeauty that he had never seen before. It shimmered in pink and white,\nlike the colour-play on the inside of sea shells.\n\n\"As the glittering water lapped the shores, the fisherman thought that\nthey too were transformed. They began to blossom and waft their\nperfumes. A soft sheen spread over them and they also took on a beauty\nwhich they had never possessed before.\n\n\"He understood how all this had come to pass. For it is thus with\nmermaids: one who beholds them must needs find them more beautiful than\nany one else, and the mermaid's blood being mixed with the water that\nbathed the shores, her beauty was transferred to both. All who saw them\nmust love them and yearn for them. This was their legacy from the\nmermaid.\"\n\nWhen the stately old gentleman had got thus far in his narrative he\nturned to Clement and looked at him. Clement nodded reverently but made\nno comment, as he did not wish to cause a break in the story.\n\n\"Now you must bear this in mind, Clement,\" the old gentleman continued,\nwith a roguish glint in his eyes. \"From that time on people emigrated to\nthe islands. At first only fishermen and peasants settled there, but\nothers, too, were attracted to them. One day the king and his earl\nsailed up the stream. They started at once to talk of these islands,\nhaving observed they were so situated that every vessel that sailed\ntoward Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar had to pass them. The earl suggested that there ought\nto be a lock put on the channel which could be opened or closed at will,\nto let in merchant vessels and shut out pirates.\n\n\"This idea was carried out,\" said the old gentleman, as he rose and\nbegan to trace in the sand again with his cane. \"On the largest of these\nislands the earl erected a fortress with a strong tower, which was\ncalled 'K\u00c3\u00a4rnan.' And around the island a wall was built. Here, at the\nnorth and south ends of the wall, they made gates and placed strong\ntowers over them. Across the other islands they built bridges; these\nwere likewise equipped with high towers. Out in the water, round about,\nthey put a wreath of piles with bars that could open and close, so that\nno vessel could sail past without permission.\n\n\"Therefore you see, Clement, the four islands which had lain so long\nunnoticed were soon strongly fortified. But this was not all, for the\nshores and the sound tempted people, and before long they came from all\nquarters to settle there. They built a church, which has since been\ncalled 'Storkyrkan.' Here it stands, near the castle. And here, within\nthe walls, were the little huts the pioneers built for themselves. They\nwere primitive, but they served their purpose. More was not needed at\nthat time to make the place pass for a city. And the city was named\nStockholm.\n\n\"There came a day, Clement, when the earl who had begun the work went to\nhis final rest, and Stockholm was without a master builder. Monks called\nthe Gray Friars came to the country. Stockholm attracted them. They\nasked permission to erect a monastery there, so the king gave them an\nisland--one of the smaller ones--this one facing Lake M\u00c3\u00a4lar. There they\nbuilt, and the place was called Gray Friars' Island. Other monks came,\ncalled the Black Friars. They, too, asked for right to build in\nStockholm, near the south gate. On this, the larger of the islands north\nof the city, a 'Holy Ghost House,' or hospital, was built; while on the\nsmaller one thrifty men put up a mill, and along the little islands\nclose by the monks fished. As you know, there is only one island now,\nfor the canal between the two has filled up; but it is still called Holy\nGhost Island.\n\n\"And now, Clement, all the little wooded islands were dotted with\nhouses, but still people kept streaming in; for these shores and waters\nhave the power to draw people to them. Hither came pious women of the\nOrder of Saint Clara and asked for ground to build upon. For them there\nwas no choice but to settle on the north shore, at Norrmalm, as it is\ncalled. You may be sure that they were not over pleased with this\nlocation, for across Norrmalm ran a high ridge, and on that the city had\nits gallows hill, so that it was a detested spot. Nevertheless the Poor\nClares erected their church and their convent on the strand below the\nridge. After they were established there they soon found plenty of\nfollowers. Upon the ridge itself were built a hospital and a church,\nconsecrated to Saint Goran, and just below the ridge a church was\nerected to Saint Jacob.\n\n\"And even at S\u00c3\u00b6dermalm, where the mountain rises perpendicularly from\nthe strand, they began to build. There they raised a church to Saint\nMary.\n\n\"But you must not think that only cloister folk moved to Stockholm!\nThere were also many others--principally German tradesmen and artisans.\nThese were more skilled than the Swedes, and were well received. They\nsettled within the walls of the city where they pulled down the wretched\nlittle cabins that stood there and built high, magnificent stone houses.\nBut space was not plentiful within the walls, therefore they had to\nbuild the houses close together, with gables facing the narrow by-lanes.\nSo you see, Clement, that Stockholm could attract people!\"\n\nAt this point in the narrative another gentleman appeared and walked\nrapidly down the path toward the man who was talking to Clement, but he\nwaved his hand, and the other remained at a distance. The dignified old\ngentleman still sat on the bench beside the fiddler.\n\n\"Now, Clement, you must render me a service,\" he said. \"I have no time\nto talk more with you, but I will send you a book about Stockholm and\nyou must read it from cover to cover. I have, so to speak, laid the\nfoundations of Stockholm for you. Study the rest out for yourself and\nlearn how the city has thrived and changed. Read how the little, narrow,\nwall-enclosed city on the islands has spread into this great sea of\nhouses below us. Read how, on the spot where the dark tower K\u00c3\u00a4rnan once\nstood, the beautiful, light castle below us was erected and how the Gray\nFriars' church has been turned into the burial place of the Swedish\nkings; read how islet after islet was built up with factories; how the\nridge was lowered and the sound filled in; how the truck gardens at the\nsouth and north ends of the city have been converted into beautiful\nparks or built-up quarters; how the King's private deer park has become\nthe people's favourite pleasure resort. You must make yourself at home\nhere, Clement. This city does not belong exclusively to the\nStockholmers. It belongs to you and to all Swedes.\n\n\"As you read about Stockholm, remember that I have spoken the truth, for\nthe city has the power to draw every one to it. First the King moved\nhere, then the nobles built their palaces here, and then one after\nanother was attracted to the place, so that now, as you see, Stockholm\nis not a city unto itself or for nearby districts; it has grown into a\ncity for the whole kingdom.\n\n\"You know, Clement, that there are judicial courts in every parish\nthroughout the land, but in Stockholm they have jurisdiction for the\nwhole nation. You know that there are judges in every district court in\nthe country, but at Stockholm there is only one court, to which all the\nothers are accountable. You know that there are barracks and troops in\nevery part of the land, but those at Stockholm command the whole army.\nEverywhere in the country you will find railroads, but the whole great\nnational system is controlled and managed at Stockholm; here you will\nfind the governing boards for the clergy, for teachers, for physicians,\nfor bailiffs and jurors. This is the heart of your country, Clement. All\nthe change you have in your pocket is coined here, and the postage\nstamps you stick on your letters are made here. There is something here\nfor every Swede. Here no one need feel homesick, for here all Swedes are\nat home.\n\n\"And when you read of all that has been brought here to Stockholm, think\ntoo of the latest that the city has attracted to itself: these old-time\npeasant cottages here at Skansen; the old dances; the old costumes and\nhouse-furnishings; the musicians and story-tellers. Everything good of\nthe old times Stockholm has tempted here to Skansen to do it honour,\nthat it may, in turn, stand before the people with renewed glory.\n\n\"But, first and last, remember as you read about Stockholm that you are\nto sit in this place. You must see how the waves sparkle in joyous play\nand how the shores shimmer with beauty. You will come under the spell of\ntheir witchery, Clement.\"\n\nThe handsome old gentleman had raised his voice, so that it rang out\nstrong and commanding, and his eyes shone. Then he rose, and, with a\nwave of his hand to Clement, walked away. Clement understood that the\none who had been talking to him was a great man, and he bowed to him as\nlow as he could.\n\nThe next day came a royal lackey with a big red book and a letter for\nClement, and in the letter it said that the book was from the King.\n\nAfter that the little old man, Clement Larsson, was lightheaded for\nseveral days, and it was impossible to get a sensible word out of him.\nWhen a week had gone by, he went to the superintendent and gave in his\nnotice. He simply had to go home.\n\n\"Why must you go home? Can't you learn to be content here?\" asked the\ndoctor.\n\n\"Oh, I'm contented here,\" said Clement. \"That matter troubles me no\nlonger, but I must go home all the same.\"\n\nClement was quite perturbed because the King had said that he should\nlearn all about Stockholm and be happy there. But he could not rest\nuntil he had told every one at home that the King had said those words\nto him. He could not renounce the idea of standing on the church knoll\nat home and telling high and low that the King had been so kind to him,\nthat he had sat beside him on the bench, and had sent him a book, and\nhad taken the time to talk to him--a poor fiddler--for a whole hour, in\norder to cure him of his homesickness. It was good to relate this to the\nLaplanders and Dalecarlian peasant girls at Skansen, but what was that\ncompared to being able to tell of it at home?\n\nEven if Clement were to end in the poorhouse, it wouldn't be so hard\nafter this. He was a totally different man from what he had been, and he\nwould be respected and honoured in a very different way.\n\nThis new yearning took possession of Clement. He simply had to go up to\nthe doctor and say that he must go home.\n\n\nGORGO, THE EAGLE\n\n\nIN THE MOUNTAIN GLEN\n\nFar up among the mountains of Lapland there was an old eagle's nest on a\nledge which projected from a high cliff. The nest was made of dry twigs\nof pine and spruce, interlaced one with another until they formed a\nperfect network. Year by year the nest had been repaired and\nstrengthened. It was about two metres wide, and nearly as high as a\nLaplander's hut.\n\nThe cliff on which the eagle's nest was situated towered above a big\nglen, which was inhabited in summer by a flock of wild geese, as it was\nan excellent refuge for them. It was so secluded between cliffs that not\nmany knew of it, even among the Laplanders themselves.\n\nIn the heart of this glen there was a small, round lake in which was an\nabundance of food for the tiny goslings, and on the tufted lake shores\nwhich were covered with osier bushes and dwarfed birches the geese found\nfine nesting places.\n\nIn all ages eagles had lived on the mountain, and geese in the glen.\nEvery year the former carried off a few of the latter, but they were\nvery careful not to take so many that the wild geese would be afraid to\nremain in the glen. The geese, in their turn, found the eagles quite\nuseful. They were robbers, to be sure, but they kept other robbers away.\n\nTwo years before Nils Holgersson travelled with the wild geese the old\nleader-goose, Akka from Kebnekaise, was standing at the foot of the\nmountain slope looking toward the eagle's nest.\n\nThe eagles were in the habit of starting on their chase soon after\nsunrise; during the summers that Akka had lived in the glen she had\nwatched every morning for their departure to find if they stopped in the\nglen to hunt, or if they flew beyond it to other hunting grounds.\n\nShe did not have to wait long before the two eagles left the ledge on\nthe cliff. Stately and terror-striking they soared into the air. They\ndirected their course toward the plain, and Akka breathed a sigh of\nrelief.\n\nThe old leader-goose's days of nesting and rearing of young were over,\nand during the summer she passed the time going from one goose range to\nanother, giving counsel regarding the brooding and care of the young.\nAside from this she kept an eye out not only for eagles but also for\nmountain fox and owls and all other enemies who were a menace to the\nwild geese and their young.\n\nAbout noontime Akka began to watch for the eagles again. This she had\ndone every day during all the summers that she had lived in the glen.\nShe could tell at once by their flight if their hunt had been\nsuccessful, and in that event she felt relieved for the safety of those\nwho belonged to her. But on this particular day she had not seen the\neagles return. \"I must be getting old and stupid,\" she thought, when she\nhad waited a time for them. \"The eagles have probably been home this\nlong while.\"\n\nIn the afternoon she looked toward the cliff again, expecting to see the\neagles perched on the rocky ledge where they usually took their\nafternoon rest; toward evening, when they took their bath in the dale\nlake, she tried again to get sight of them, but failed. Again she\nbemoaned the fact that she was growing old. She was so accustomed to\nhaving the eagles on the mountain above her that she could not imagine\nthe possibility of their not having returned.\n\nThe following morning Akka was awake in good season to watch for the\neagles; but she did not see them. On the other hand, she heard in the\nmorning stillness a cry that sounded both angry and plaintive, and it\nseemed to come from the eagles' nest. \"Can there possibly be anything\namiss with the eagles?\" she wondered. She spread her wings quickly, and\nrose so high that she could perfectly well look down into the nest.\n\nThere she saw neither of the eagles. There was no one in the nest save a\nlittle half-fledged eaglet who was screaming for food.\n\nAkka sank down toward the eagles' nest, slowly and reluctantly. It was a\ngruesome place to come to! It was plain what kind of robber folk lived\nthere! In the nest and on the cliff ledge lay bleached bones, bloody\nfeathers, pieces of skin, hares' heads, birds' beaks, and the tufted\nclaws of grouse. The eaglet, who was lying in the midst of this, was\nrepulsive to look upon, with his big, gaping bill, his awkward,\ndown-clad body, and his undeveloped wings where the prospective quills\nstuck out like thorns.\n\nAt last Akka conquered her repugnance and alighted on the edge of the\nnest, at the same time glancing about her anxiously in every direction,\nfor each second she expected to see the old eagles coming back.\n\n\"It is well that some one has come at last,\" cried the baby eagle.\n\"Fetch me some food at once!\"\n\n\"Well, well, don't be in such haste,\" said Akka. \"Tell me first where\nyour father and mother are.\"\n\n\"That's what I should like to know myself. They went off yesterday\nmorning and left me a lemming to live upon while they were away. You can\nbelieve that was eaten long ago. It's a shame for mother to let me\nstarve in this way!\"\n\nAkka began to think that the eagles had really been shot, and she\nreasoned that if she were to let the eaglet starve she might perhaps be\nrid of the whole robber tribe for all time. But it went very much\nagainst her not to succour a deserted young one so far as she could.\n\n\"Why do you sit there and stare?\" snapped the eaglet. \"Didn't you hear\nme say I want food?\"\n\nAkka spread her wings and sank down to the little lake in the glen. A\nmoment later she returned to the eagles' nest with a salmon trout in her\nbill.\n\nThe eaglet flew into a temper when she dropped the fish in front of him.\n\n\"Do you think I can eat such stuff?\" he shrieked, pushing it aside, and\ntrying to strike Akka with his bill. \"Fetch me a willow grouse or a\nlemming, do you hear?\"\n\nAkka stretched her head forward, and gave the eaglet a sharp nip in the\nneck. \"Let me say to you,\" remarked the old goose, \"that if I'm to\nprocure food for you, you must be satisfied with what I give you. Your\nfather and mother are dead, and from them you can get no help; but if\nyou want to lie here and starve to death while you wait for grouse and\nlemming, I shall not hinder you.\"\n\nWhen Akka had spoken her mind she promptly retired, and did not show her\nface in the eagles' nest again for some time. But when she did return,\nthe eaglet had eaten the fish, and when she dropped another in front of\nhim he swallowed it at once, although it was plain that he found it very\ndistasteful.\n\nAkka had imposed upon herself a tedious task. The old eagles never\nappeared again, and she alone had to procure for the eaglet all the food\nhe needed. She gave him fish and frogs and he did not seem to fare badly\non this diet, but grew big and strong. He soon forgot his parents, the\neagles, and fancied that Akka was his real mother. Akka, in turn, loved\nhim as if he had been her own child. She tried to give him a good\nbringing up, and to cure him of his wildness and overbearing ways.\n\nAfter a fortnight Akka observed that the time was approaching for her to\nmoult and put on a new feather dress so as to be ready to fly. For a\nwhole moon she would be unable to carry food to the baby eaglet, and he\nmight starve to death.\n\nSo Akka said to him one day: \"Gorgo, I can't come to you any more with\nfish. Everything depends now upon your pluck--which means can you dare\nto venture into the glen, so I can continue to procure food for you? You\nmust choose between starvation and flying down to the glen, but that,\ntoo, may cost you your life.\"\n\nWithout a second's hesitation the eaglet stepped upon the edge of the\nnest. Barely taking the trouble to measure the distance to the bottom,\nhe spread his tiny wings and started away. He rolled over and over in\nspace, but nevertheless made enough use of his wings to reach the ground\nalmost unhurt.\n\nDown there in the glen Gorgo passed the summer in company with the\nlittle goslings, and was a good comrade for them. Since he regarded\nhimself as a gosling, he tried to live as they lived; when they swam in\nthe lake he followed them until he came near drowning. It was most\nembarrassing to him that he could not learn to swim, and he went to Akka\nand complained of his inability.\n\n\"Why can't I swim like the others?\" he asked.\n\n\"Your claws grew too hooked, and your toes too large while you were up\nthere on the cliff,\" Akka replied. \"But you'll make a fine bird all the\nsame.\"\n\nThe eaglet's wings soon grew so large that they could carry him; but not\nuntil autumn, when the goslings learned to fly, did it dawn upon him\nthat he could use them for flight. There came a proud time for him, for\nat this sport he was the peer of them all. His companions never stayed\nup in the air any longer than they had to, but he stayed there nearly\nthe whole day, and practised the art of flying. So far it had not\noccurred to him that he was of another species than the geese, but he\ncould not help noting a number of things that surprised him, and he\nquestioned Akka constantly.\n\n\"Why do grouse and lemming run and hide when they see my shadow on the\ncliff?\" he queried. \"They don't show such fear of the other goslings.\"\n\n\"Your wings grew too big when you were on the cliff,\" said Akka. \"It is\nthat which frightens the little wretches. But don't be unhappy because\nof that. You'll be a fine bird all the same.\"\n\nAfter the eagle had learned to fly, he taught himself to fish, and to\ncatch frogs. But by and by he began to ponder this also.\n\n\"How does it happen that I live on fish and frogs?\" he asked. \"The other\ngoslings don't.\"\n\n\"This is due to the fact that I had no other food to give you when you\nwere on the cliff,\" said Akka. \"But don't let that make you sad. You'll\nbe a fine bird all the same.\"\n\nWhen the wild geese began their autumn moving, Gorgo flew along with the\nflock, regarding himself all the while as one of them. The air was\nfilled with birds who were on their way south, and there was great\nexcitement among them when Akka appeared with an eagle in her train. The\nwild goose flock was continually surrounded by swarms of the curious who\nloudly expressed their astonishment. Akka bade them be silent, but it\nwas impossible to stop so many wagging tongues.\n\n\"Why do they call me an eagle?\" Gorgo asked repeatedly, growing more and\nmore exasperated. \"Can't they see that I'm a wild goose? I'm no\nbird-eater who preys upon his kind. How dare they give me such an ugly\nname?\"\n\nOne day they flew above a barn yard where many chickens walked on a dump\nheap and picked. \"An eagle! An eagle!\" shrieked the chickens, and\nstarted to run for shelter. But Gorgo, who had heard the eagles spoken\nof as savage criminals, could not control his anger. He snapped his\nwings together and shot down to the ground, striking his talons into one\nof the hens. \"I'll teach you, I will, that I'm no eagle!\" he screamed\nfuriously, and struck with his beak.\n\nThat instant he heard Akka call to him from the air, and rose\nobediently. The wild goose flew toward him and began to reprimand him.\n\"What are you trying to do?\" she cried, beating him with her bill. \"Was\nit perhaps your intention to tear that poor hen to pieces?\" But when the\neagle took his punishment from the wild goose without a protest, there\narose from the great bird throng around them a perfect storm of taunts\nand gibes. The eagle heard this, and turned toward Akka with flaming\neyes, as though he would have liked to attack her. But he suddenly\nchanged his mind, and with quick wing strokes bounded into the air,\nsoaring so high that no call could reach him; and he sailed around up\nthere as long as the wild geese saw him.\n\nTwo days later he appeared again in the wild goose flock.\n\n\"I know who I am,\" he said to Akka. \"Since I am an eagle, I must live\nas becomes an eagle; but I think that we can be friends all the same.\nYou or any of yours I shall never attack.\"\n\nBut Akka had set her heart on successfully training an eagle into a mild\nand harmless bird, and she could not tolerate his wanting to do as he\nchose.\n\n\"Do you think that I wish to be the friend of a bird-eater?\" she asked.\n\"Live as I have taught you to live, and you may travel with my flock as\nheretofore.\"\n\nBoth were proud and stubborn, and neither of them would yield. It ended\nin Akka's forbidding the eagle to show his face in her neighbourhood,\nand her anger toward him was so intense that no one dared speak his name\nin her presence.\n\nAfter that Gorgo roamed around the country, alone and shunned, like all\ngreat robbers. He was often downhearted, and certainly longed many a\ntime for the days when he thought himself a wild goose, and played with\nthe merry goslings.\n\nAmong the animals he had a great reputation for courage. They used to\nsay of him that he feared no one but his foster-mother, Akka. And they\ncould also say of him that he never used violence against a wild goose.\n\nIN CAPTIVITY\n\nGorgo was only three years old, and had not as yet thought about\nmarrying and procuring a home for himself, when he was captured one day\nby a hunter, and sold to the Skansen Zo\u00c3\u00b6logical Garden, where there were\nalready two eagles held captive in a cage built of iron bars and steel\nwires. The cage stood out in the open, and was so large that a couple of\ntrees had easily been moved into it, and quite a large cairn was piled\nup in there. Notwithstanding all this, the birds were unhappy. They sat\nmotionless on the same spot nearly all day. Their pretty, dark feather\ndresses became rough and lustreless, and their eyes were riveted with\nhopeless longing on the sky without.\n\nDuring the first week of Gorgo's captivity he was still awake and full\nof life, but later a heavy torpor came upon him. He perched himself on\none spot, like the other eagles, and stared at vacancy. He no longer\nknew how the days passed.\n\nOne morning when Gorgo sat in his usual torpor, he heard some one call\nto him from below. He was so drowsy that he could barely rouse himself\nenough to lower his glance.\n\n\"Who is calling me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, Gorgo! Don't you know me? It's Thumbietot who used to fly around\nwith the wild geese.\"\n\n\"Is Akka also captured?\" asked Gorgo in the tone of one who is trying to\ncollect his thoughts after a long sleep.\n\n\"No; Akka, the white goosey-gander, and the whole flock are probably\nsafe and sound up in Lapland at this season,\" said the boy. \"It's only I\nwho am a prisoner here.\"\n\nAs the boy was speaking he noticed that Gorgo averted his glance, and\nbegan to stare into space again.\n\n\"Golden eagle!\" cried the boy; \"I have not forgotten that once you\ncarried me back to the wild geese, and that you spared the white\ngoosey-gander's life! Tell me if I can be of any help to you!\"\n\nGorgo scarcely raised his head. \"Don't disturb me, Thumbietot,\" he\nyawned. \"I'm sitting here dreaming that I am free, and am soaring away\nup among the clouds. I don't want to be awake.\"\n\n\"You must rouse yourself, and see what goes on around you,\" the boy\nadmonished, \"or you will soon look as wretched as the other eagles.\"\n\n\"I wish I were as they are! They are so lost in their dreams that\nnothing more can trouble them,\" said the eagle.\n\nWhen night came, and all three eagles were asleep, there was a light\nscraping on the steel wires stretched across the top of the cage. The\ntwo listless old captives did not allow themselves to be disturbed by\nthe noise, but Gorgo awakened.\n\n\"Who's there? Who is moving up on the roof?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's Thumbietot, Gorgo,\" answered the boy. \"I'm sitting here filing\naway at the steel wires so that you can escape.\"\n\nThe eagle raised his head, and saw in the night light how the boy sat\nand filed the steel wires at the top of the cage. He felt hopeful for an\ninstant, but soon discouragement got the upper hand.\n\n\"I'm a big bird, Thumbietot,\" said Gorgo; \"how can you ever manage to\nfile away enough wires for me to come out? You'd better quit that, and\nleave me in peace.\"\n\n\"Oh, go to sleep, and don't bother about me!\" said the boy. \"I'll not be\nthrough to-night nor to-morrow night, but I shall try to free you in\ntime for here you'll become a total wreck.\"\n\nGorgo fell asleep. When he awoke the next morning he saw at a glance\nthat a number of wires had been filed. That day he felt less drowsy than\nhe had done in the past. He spread his wings, and fluttered from branch\nto branch to get the stiffness out of his joints.\n\nOne morning early, just as the first streak of sunlight made its\nappearance, Thumbietot awakened the eagle.\n\n\"Try now, Gorgo!\" he whispered.\n\nThe eagle looked up. The boy had actually filed off so many wires that\nnow there was a big hole in the wire netting. Gorgo flapped his wings\nand propelled himself upward. Twice he missed and fell back into the\ncage; but finally he succeeded in getting out.\n\nWith proud wing strokes he soared into the clouds. Little Thumbietot sat\nand gazed after him with a mournful expression. He wished that some one\nwould come and give him his freedom too.\n\nThe boy was domiciled now at Skansen. He had become acquainted with all\nthe animals there, and had made many friends among them. He had to admit\nthat there was so much to see and learn there that it was not difficult\nfor him to pass the time. To be sure his thoughts went forth every day\nto Morten Goosey-Gander and his other comrades, and he yearned for them.\n\"If only I weren't bound by my promise,\" he thought, \"I'd find some bird\nto take me to them!\"\n\nIt may seem strange that Clement Larsson had not restored the boy's\nliberty, but one must remember how excited the little fiddler had been\nwhen he left Skansen. The morning of his departure he had thought of\nsetting out the midget's food in a blue bowl, but, unluckily, he had\nbeen unable to find one. All the Skansen folk--Lapps, peasant girls,\nartisans, and gardeners--had come to bid him good-bye, and he had had no\ntime to search for a blue bowl. It was time to start, and at the last\nmoment he had to ask the old Laplander to help him.\n\n\"One of the tiny folk happens to be living here at Skansen,\" said\nClement, \"and every morning I set out a little food for him. Will you do\nme the favour of taking these few coppers and purchasing a blue bowl\nwith them? Put a little gruel and milk in it, and to-morrow morning set\nit out under the steps of Bolln\u00c3\u00a4s cottage.\"\n\nThe old Laplander looked surprised, but there was no time for Clement to\nexplain further, as he had to be off to the railway station.\n\nThe Laplander went down to the zo\u00c3\u00b6logical village to purchase the bowl.\nAs he saw no blue one that he thought appropriate, he bought a white\none, and this he conscientiously filled and set out every morning.\n\nThat was why the boy had not been released from his pledge. He knew that\nClement had gone away, but _he_ was not allowed to leave.\n\nThat night the boy longed more than ever for his freedom. This was\nbecause summer had come now in earnest. During his travels he had\nsuffered much in cold and stormy weather, and when he first came to\nSkansen he had thought that perhaps it was just as well that he had been\ncompelled to break the journey. He would have been frozen to death had\nhe gone to Lapland in the month of May. But now it was warm; the earth\nwas green-clad, birches and poplars were clothed in their satiny\nfoliage, and the cherry trees--in fact all the fruit trees--were covered\nwith blossoms. The berry bushes had green berries on their stems; the\noaks had carefully unfolded their leaves, and peas, cabbages, and beans\nwere growing in the vegetable garden at Skansen.\n\n\"Now it must be warm up in Lapland,\" thought the boy. \"I should like to\nbe seated on Morten Goosey-Gander's back on a fine morning like this! It\nwould be great fun to ride around in the warm, still air, and look down\nat the ground, as it now lies decked with green grass, and embellished\nwith pretty blossoms.\"\n\nHe sat musing on this when the eagle suddenly swooped down from the sky,\nand perched beside the boy, on top of the cage.\n\n\"I wanted to try my wings to see if they were still good for anything,\"\nsaid Gorgo. \"You didn't suppose that I meant to leave you here in\ncaptivity? Get up on my back, and I'll take you to your comrades.\"\n\n\"No, that's impossible!\" the boy answered. \"I have pledged my word that\nI would stay here till I am liberated.\"\n\n\"What sort of nonsense are you talking?\" protested Gorgo. \"In the first\nplace they brought you here against your will; then they forced you to\npromise that you would remain here. Surely you must understand that such\na promise one need not keep?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I must keep it,\" said the boy. \"I thank you all the same for\nyour kind intention, but you can't help me.\"\n\n\"Oh, can't I?\" said Gorgo. \"We'll see about that!\" In a twinkling he\ngrasped Nils Holgersson in his big talons, and rose with him toward the\nskies, disappearing in a northerly direction.\n\n\nON OVER G\u00c3\u0084STRIKLAND\n\n\nTHE PRECIOUS GIRDLE\n\n_Wednesday, June fifteenth_.\n\nThe eagle kept on flying until he was a long distance north of\nStockholm. Then he sank to a wooded hillock where he relaxed his hold on\nthe boy.\n\nThe instant Thumbietot was out of Gorgo's clutches he started to run\nback to the city as fast as he could.\n\nThe eagle made a long swoop, caught up to the boy, and stopped him with\nhis claw.\n\n\"Do you propose to go back to prison?\" he demanded.\n\n\"That's my affair. I can go where I like, for all of you!\" retorted the\nboy, trying to get away. Thereupon the eagle gripped him with his strong\ntalons, and rose in the air.\n\nNow Gorgo circled over the entire province of Uppland and did not stop\nagain until he came to the great water-falls at \u00c3\u0084lvkarleby where he\nalighted on a rock in the middle of the rushing rapids below the roaring\nfalls. Again he relaxed his hold on the captive.\n\nThe boy saw that here there was no chance of escape from the eagle.\nAbove them the white scum wall of the water-fall came tumbling down, and\nround about the river rushed along in a mighty torrent. Thumbietot was\nvery indignant to think that in this way he had been forced to become a\npromise-breaker. He turned his back to the eagle and would not speak to\nhim.\n\nNow that the bird had set the boy down in a place from which he could\nnot run away, he told him confidentially that he had been brought up by\nAkka from Kebnekaise, and that he had quarrelled with his foster-mother.\n\n\"Now, Thumbietot, perhaps you understand why I wish to take you back to\nthe wild geese,\" he said. \"I have heard that you are in great favour\nwith Akka, and it was my purpose to ask you to make peace between us.\"\n\nAs soon as the boy comprehended that the eagle had not carried him off\nin a spirit of contrariness, he felt kindly toward him.\n\n\"I should like very much to help you,\" he returned, \"but I am bound by\nmy promise.\" Thereupon he explained to the eagle how he had fallen into\ncaptivity and how Clement Larsson had left Skansen without setting him\nfree.\n\nNevertheless the eagle would not relinquish his plan.\n\n\"Listen to me, Thumbietot,\" he said. \"My wings can carry you wherever\nyou wish to go, and my eyes can search out whatever you wish to find.\nTell me how the man looks who exacted this promise from you, and I will\nfind him and take you to him. Then it is for you to do the rest.\"\n\nThumbietot approved of the proposition.\n\n\"I can see, Gorgo, that you have had a wise bird like Akka for a\nfoster-mother,\" the boy remarked.\n\nHe gave a graphic description of Clement Larsson, and added that he had\nheard at Skansen that the little fiddler was from H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland.\n\n\"We'll search for him through the whole of H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland--from Ljungby to\nMellansj\u00c3\u00b6; from Great Mountain to Hornland,\" said the eagle. \"To-morrow\nbefore sundown you shall have a talk with the man!\"\n\n\"I fear you are promising more than you can perform,\" doubted the boy.\n\n\"I should be a mighty poor eagle if I couldn't do that much,\" said\nGorgo.\n\nSo when Gorgo and Thumbietot left \u00c3\u0084lvkarleby they were good friends, and\nthe boy willingly took his mount for a ride on the eagle's back. Thus he\nhad an opportunity to see much of the country.\n\nWhen clutched in the eagle's talons he had seen nothing. Perhaps it was\njust as well, for in the forenoon he had travelled over Upsala,\n\u00c3\u0096sterby's big factories, the Dannemora Mine, and the ancient castle of\n\u00c3\u0096rbyhus, and he would have been sadly disappointed at not seeing them\nhad he known of their proximity.\n\nThe eagle bore him speedily over G\u00c3\u00a4strikland. In the southern part of\nthe province there was very little to tempt the eye. But as they flew\nnorthward, it began to be interesting.\n\n\"This country is clad in a spruce skirt and a gray-stone jacket,\"\nthought the boy. \"But around its waist it wears a girdle which has not\nits match in value, for it is embroidered with blue lakes and green\ngroves. The great ironworks adorn it like a row of precious stones, and\nits buckle is a whole city with castles and cathedrals and great\nclusters of houses.\"\n\nWhen the travellers arrived in the northern forest region, Gorgo\nalighted on top of a mountain. As the boy dismounted, the eagle said:\n\n\"There's game in this forest, and I can't forget my late captivity and\nfeel really free until I have gone a-hunting. You won't mind my leaving\nyou for a while?\"\n\n\"No, of course, I won't,\" the boy assured him.\n\n\"You may go where you like if only you are back here by sundown,\" said\nthe eagle, as he flew off.\n\nThe boy sat on a stone gazing across the bare, rocky ground and the\ngreat forests round about.\n\nHe felt rather lonely. But soon he heard singing in the forest below,\nand saw something bright moving amongst the trees. Presently he saw a\nblue and yellow banner, and he knew by the songs and the merry chatter\nthat it was being borne at the head of a procession. On it came, up the\nwinding path; he wondered where it and those who followed it were going.\nHe couldn't believe that anybody would come up to such an ugly, desolate\nwaste as the place where he sat. But the banner was nearing the forest\nborder, and behind it marched many happy people for whom it had led the\nway. Suddenly there was life and movement all over the mountain plain;\nafter that there was so much for the boy to see that he didn't have a\ndull moment.\n\nFOREST DAY\n\nOn the mountain's broad back, where Gorgo left Thumbietot, there had\nbeen a forest fire ten years before. Since that time the charred trees\nhad been felled and removed, and the great fire-swept area had begun to\ndeck itself with green along the edges, where it skirted the healthy\nforest. However, the larger part of the top was still barren and\nappallingly desolate. Charred stumps, standing sentinel-like between the\nrock ledges, bore witness that once there had been a fine forest here;\nbut no fresh roots sprang from the ground.\n\nOne day in the early summer all the children in the parish had assembled\nin front of the schoolhouse near the fire-swept mountain. Each child\ncarried either a spade or a hoe on its shoulder, and a basket of food in\nits hand. As soon as all were assembled, they marched in a long\nprocession toward the forest. The banner came first, with the teachers\non either side of it; then followed a couple of foresters and a wagon\nload of pine shrubs and spruce seeds; then the children.\n\nThe procession did not pause in any of the birch groves near the\nsettlements, but marched on deep into the forest. As it moved along, the\nfoxes stuck their heads out of the lairs in astonishment, and wondered\nwhat kind of backwoods people these were. As they marched past old coal\npits where charcoal kilns were fired every autumn, the cross-beaks\ntwisted their hooked bills, and asked one another what kind of coalers\nthese might be who were now thronging the forest.\n\nFinally, the procession reached the big, burnt mountain plain. The rocks\nhad been stripped of the fine twin-flower creepers that once covered\nthem; they had been robbed of the pretty silver moss and the attractive\nreindeer moss. Around the dark water gathered in clefts and hollows\nthere was now no wood-sorrel. The little patches of soil in crevices and\nbetween stones were without ferns, without star-flowers, without all the\ngreen and red and light and soft and soothing things which usually\nclothe the forest ground.\n\nIt was as if a bright light flashed upon the mountain when all the\nparish children covered it. Here again was something sweet and delicate;\nsomething fresh and rosy; something young and growing. Perhaps these\nchildren would bring to the poor abandoned forest a little new life.\n\nWhen the children had rested and eaten their luncheon, they seized hoes\nand spades and began to work. The foresters showed them what to do. They\nset out shrub after shrub on every clear spot of earth they could find.\n\nAs they worked, they talked quite knowingly among themselves of how the\nlittle shrubs they were planting would bind the soil so that it could\nnot get away, and of how new soil would form under the trees. By and by\nseeds would drop, and in a few years they would be picking both\nstrawberries and raspberries where now there were only bare rocks. The\nlittle shrubs which they were planting would gradually become tall\ntrees. Perhaps big houses and great splendid ships would be built from\nthem!\n\nIf the children had not come here and planted while there was still a\nlittle soil in the clefts, all the earth would have been carried away by\nwind and water, and the mountain could never more have been clothed in\ngreen.\n\n\"It was well that we came,\" said the children. \"We were just in the nick\nof time!\" They felt very important.\n\nWhile they were working on the mountain, their parents were at home. By\nand by they began to wonder how the children were getting along. Of\ncourse it was only a joke about their planting a forest, but it might be\namusing to see what they were trying to do.\n\nSo presently both fathers and mothers were on their way to the forest.\nWhen they came to the outlying stock farms they met some of their\nneighbours.\n\n\"Are you going to the fire-swept mountain?\" they asked.\n\n\"That's where we're bound for.\"\n\n\"To have a look at the children?\"\n\n\"Yes, to see what they're up to.\"\n\n\"It's only play, of course.\"\n\n\"It isn't likely that there will be many forest trees planted by the\nyoungsters. We have brought the coffee pot along so that we can have\nsomething warm to drink, since we must stay there all day with only\nlunch-basket provisions.\"\n\nSo the parents of the children went on up the mountain. At first they\nthought only of how pretty it looked to see all the rosy-cheeked little\nchildren scattered over the gray hills. Later, they observed how the\nchildren were working--how some were setting out shrubs, while others\nwere digging furrows and sowing seeds. Others again were pulling up\nheather to prevent its choking the young trees. They saw that the\nchildren took the work seriously and were so intent upon what they were\ndoing that they scarcely had time to glance up.\n\nThe fathers and mothers stood for a moment and looked on; then they too\nbegan to pull up heather--just for the fun of it. The children were the\ninstructors, for they were already trained, and had to show their elders\nwhat to do.\n\nThus it happened that all the grown-ups who had come to watch the\nchildren took part in the work. Then, of course, it became greater fun\nthan before. By and by the children had even more help. Other implements\nwere needed, so a couple of long-legged boys were sent down to the\nvillage for spades and hoes. As they ran past the cabins, the\nstay-at-homes came out and asked: \"What's wrong? Has there been an\naccident?\"\n\n\"No, indeed! But the whole parish is up on the fire-swept mountain\nplanting a forest.\"\n\n\"If the whole parish is there, we can't stay at home!\"\n\nSo party after party of peasants went crowding to the top of the burnt\nmountain. They stood a moment and looked on. The temptation to join the\nworkers was irresistible.\n\n\"It's a pleasure to sow one's own acres in the spring, and to think of\nthe grain that will spring up from the earth, but this work is even more\nalluring,\" they thought.\n\nNot only slender blades would come from that sowing, but mighty trees\nwith tall trunks and sturdy branches. It meant giving birth not merely\nto a summer's grain, but to many years' growths. It meant the awakening\nhum of insects, the song of the thrush, the play of grouse and all kinds\nof life on the desolate mountain. Moreover, it was like raising a\nmemorial for coming generations. They could have left a bare, treeless\nheight as a heritage. Instead they were to leave a glorious forest.\n\nComing generations would know their forefathers had been a good and wise\nfolk and they would remember them with reverence and gratitude.\n\n\nA DAY IN H\u00c3\u0084LSINGLAND\n\n\nA LARGE GREEN LEAF\n\n_Thursday, June sixteenth_.\n\nThe following day the boy travelled over H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland. It spread beneath\nhim with new, pale-green shoots on the pine trees, new birch leaves in\nthe groves, new green grass in the meadows, and sprouting grain in the\nfields. It was a mountainous country, but directly through it ran a\nbroad, light valley from either side of which branched other\nvalleys--some short and narrow, some broad and long.\n\n\"This land resembles a leaf,\" thought the boy, \"for it's as green as a\nleaf, and the valleys subdivide it in about the same way as the veins of\na leaf are foliated.\"\n\nThe branch valleys, like the main one, were filled with lakes, rivers,\nfarms, and villages. They snuggled, light and smiling, between the dark\nmountains until they were gradually squeezed together by the hills.\nThere they were so narrow that they could not hold more than a little\nbrook.\n\nOn the high land between the valleys there were pine forests which had\nno even ground to grow upon. There were mountains standing all about,\nand the forest covered the whole, like a woolly hide stretched over a\nbony body.\n\nIt was a picturesque country to look down upon, and the boy saw a good\ndeal of it, because the eagle was trying to find the old fiddler,\nClement Larsson, and flew from ravine to ravine looking for him.\n\nA little later in the morning there was life and movement on every farm.\nThe doors of the cattle sheds were thrown wide open and the cows were\nlet out. They were prettily coloured, small, supple and sprightly, and\nso sure-footed that they made the most comic leaps and bounds. After\nthem came the calves and sheep, and it was plainly to be seen that they,\ntoo, were in the best of spirits.\n\nIt grew livelier every moment in the farm yards. A couple of young girls\nwith knapsacks on their backs walked among the cattle; a boy with a long\nswitch kept the sheep together, and a little dog ran in and out among\nthe cows, barking at the ones that tried to gore him. The farmer hitched\na horse to a cart loaded with tubs of butter, boxes of cheese, and all\nkinds of eatables. The people laughed and chattered. They and the beasts\nwere alike merry--as if looking forward to a day of real pleasure.\n\nA moment later all were on their way to the forest. One of the girls\nwalked in the lead and coaxed the cattle with pretty, musical calls. The\nanimals followed in a long line. The shepherd boy and the sheep-dog ran\nhither and thither, to see that no creature turned from the right\ncourse; and last came the farmer and his hired man. They walked beside\nthe cart to prevent its being upset, for the road they followed was a\nnarrow, stony forest path.\n\nIt may have been the custom for all the peasants in H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland to send\ntheir cattle into the forests on the same day--or perhaps it only\nhappened so that year; at any rate the boy saw how processions of happy\npeople and cattle wandered out from every valley and every farm and\nrushed into the lonely forest, filling it with life. From the depths of\nthe dense woods the boy heard the shepherd maidens' songs and the tinkle\nof the cow bells. Many of the processions had long and difficult roads\nto travel; and the boy saw how they tramped through marshes, how they\nhad to take roundabout ways to get past windfalls, and how, time and\nagain, the carts bumped against stones and turned over with all their\ncontents. But the people met all the obstacles with jokes and laughter.\n\nIn the afternoon they came to a cleared space where cattle sheds and a\ncouple of rude cabins had been built. The cows mooed with delight as\nthey tramped on the luscious green grass in the yards between the\ncabins, and at once began grazing. The peasants, with merry chatter and\nbanter, carried water and wood and all that had been brought in the\ncarts into the larger cabin. Presently smoke rose from the chimney and\nthen the dairymaids, the shepherd boy, and the men squatted upon a flat\nrock and ate their supper.\n\nGorgo, the eagle, was certain that he should find Clement Larsson among\nthose who were off for the forest. Whenever he saw a stock farm\nprocession, he sank down and scrutinized it with his sharp eyes; but\nhour after hour passed without his finding the one he sought.\n\nAfter much circling around, toward evening they came to a stony and\ndesolate tract east of the great main valley. There the boy saw another\noutlying stock farm under him. The people and the cattle had arrived.\nThe men were splitting wood, and the dairymaids were milking the cows.\n\n\"Look there!\" said Gorgo. \"I think we've got him.\"\n\nHe sank, and, to his great astonishment, the boy saw that the eagle was\nright. There indeed stood little Clement Larsson chopping wood.\n\nGorgo alighted on a pine tree in the thick woods a little away from the\nhouse.\n\n\"I have fulfilled my obligation,\" said the eagle, with a proud toss of\nhis head. \"Now you must try and have a word with the man. I'll perch\nhere at the top of the thick pine and wait for you.\"\n\nTHE ANIMALS' NEW YEAR'S EVE\n\nThe day's work was done at the forest ranches, supper was over, and the\npeasants sat about and chatted. It was a long time since they had been\nin the forest of a summer's night, and they seemed reluctant to go to\nbed and sleep. It was as light as day, and the dairymaids were busy with\ntheir needle-work. Ever and anon they raised their heads, looked toward\nthe forest and smiled. \"Now we are here again!\" they said. The town,\nwith its unrest, faded from their minds, and the forest, with its\npeaceful stillness, enfolded them. When at home they had wondered how\nthey should ever be able to endure the loneliness of the woods; but\nonce there, they felt that they were having their best time.\n\nMany of the young girls and young men from neighbouring ranches had come\nto call upon them, so that there were quite a lot of folk seated on the\ngrass before the cabins, but they did not find it easy to start\nconversation. The men were going home the next day, so the dairymaids\ngave them little commissions and bade them take greetings to their\nfriends in the village. This was nearly all that had been said.\n\nSuddenly the eldest of the dairy girls looked up from her work and said\nlaughingly:\n\n\"There's no need of our sitting here so silent to-night, for we have two\nstory-tellers with us. One is Clement Larsson, who sits beside me, and\nthe other is Bernhard from Sunnasj\u00c3\u00b6, who stands back there gazing toward\nBlack's Ridge. I think that we should ask each of them to tell us a\nstory. To the one who entertains us the better I shall give the muffler\nI am knitting.\"\n\nThis proposal won hearty applause. The two competitors offered lame\nexcuses, naturally, but were quickly persuaded. Clement asked Bernhard\nto begin, and he did not object. He knew little of Clement Larsson, but\nassumed that he would come out with some story about ghosts and trolls.\nAs he knew that people liked to listen to such things, he thought it\nbest to choose something of the same sort.\n\n\"Some centuries ago,\" he began, \"a dean here in Delsbo township was\nriding through the dense forest on a New Year's Eve. He was on\nhorseback, dressed in fur coat and cap. On the pommel of his saddle hung\na satchel in which he kept the communion service, the Prayer-book, and\nthe clerical robe. He had been summoned on a parochial errand to a\nremote forest settlement, where he had talked with a sick person until\nlate in the evening. Now he was on his way home, but feared that he\nshould not get back to the rectory until after midnight.\n\n\"As he had to sit in the saddle when he should have been at home in his\nbed, he was glad it was not a rough night. The weather was mild, the air\nstill and the skies overcast. Behind the clouds hung a full round moon\nwhich gave some light, although it was out of sight. But for that faint\nlight it would have been impossible for him to distinguish paths from\nfields, for that was a snowless winter, and all things had the same\ngrayish-brown colour.\n\n\"The horse the dean rode was one he prized very highly. He was strong\nand sturdy, and quite as wise as a human being. He could find his way\nhome from any place in the township. The dean had observed this on\nseveral occasions, and he relied upon it with such a sense of security\nthat he never troubled himself to think where he was going when he rode\nthat horse. So he came along now in the gray night, through the\nbewildering forest, with the reins dangling and his thoughts far away.\n\n\"He was thinking of the sermon he had to preach on the morrow, and of\nmuch else besides, and it was a long time before it occurred to him to\nnotice how far along he was on his homeward way. When he did glance up,\nhe saw that the forest was as dense about him as at the beginning, and\nhe was somewhat surprised, for he had ridden so long that he should have\ncome to the inhabited portion of the township.\n\n\"Delsbo was about the same then as now. The church and parsonage and all\nthe large farms and villages were at the northern end of the township,\nwhile at the southern part there were only forests and mountains. The\ndean saw that he was still in the unpopulated district and knew that he\nwas in the southern part and must ride to the north to get home. There\nwere no stars, nor was there a moon to guide him; but he was a man who\nhad the four cardinal points in his head. He had the positive feeling\nthat he was travelling southward, or possibly eastward.\n\n\"He intended to turn the horse at once, but hesitated. The animal had\nnever strayed, and it did not seem likely that he would do so now. It\nwas more likely that the dean was mistaken. He had been far away in\nthought and had not looked at the road. So he let the horse continue in\nthe same direction, and again lost himself in his reverie.\n\n\"Suddenly a big branch struck him and almost swept him off the horse.\nThen he realized that he must find out where he was.\n\n\"He glanced down and saw that he was riding over a soft marsh, where\nthere was no beaten path. The horse trotted along at a brisk pace and\nshowed no uncertainty. Again the dean was positive that he was going in\nthe wrong direction, and now he did not hesitate to interfere. He seized\nthe reins and turned the horse about, guiding him back to the roadway.\nNo sooner was he there than he turned again and made straight for the\nwoods.\n\n\"The dean was certain that he was going wrong, but because the beast was\nso persistent he thought that probably he was trying to find a better\nroad, and let him go along.\n\n\"The horse did very well, although he had no path to follow. If a\nprecipice obstructed his way, he climbed it as nimbly as a goat, and\nlater, when they had to descend, he bunched his hoofs and slid down the\nrocky inclines.\n\n\"'May he only find his way home before church hour!' thought the dean.\n'I wonder how the Delsbo folk would take it if I were not at my church\non time?'\n\n\"He did not have to brood over this long, for soon he came to a place\nthat was familiar to him. It was a little creek where he had fished the\nsummer before. Now he saw it was as he had feared--he was in the depths\nof the forest, and the horse was plodding along in a south-easterly\ndirection. He seemed determined to carry the dean as far from church and\nrectory as he could.\n\n\"The clergyman dismounted. He could not let the horse carry him into the\nwilderness. He must go home. And, since the animal persisted in going in\nthe wrong direction, he decided to walk and lead him until they came to\nmore familiar roads. The dean wound the reins around his arm and began\nto walk. It was not an easy matter to tramp through the forest in a\nheavy fur coat; but the dean was strong and hardy and had little fear of\noverexertion.\n\n\"The horse, meanwhile, caused him fresh anxiety. He would not follow but\nplanted his hoofs firmly on the ground.\n\n\"At last the dean was angry. He had never beaten that horse, nor did he\nwish to do so now. Instead, he threw down the reins and walked away.\n\n\"'We may as well part company here, since you want to go your own way,'\nhe said.\n\n\"He had not taken more than two steps before the horse came after him,\ntook a cautious grip on his coat sleeve and stopped him. The dean turned\nand looked the horse straight in the eyes, as if to search out why he\nbehaved so strangely.\n\n\"Afterward the dean could not quite understand how this was possible,\nbut it is certain that, dark as it was, he plainly saw the horse's face\nand read it like that of a human being. He realized that the animal was\nin a terrible state of apprehension and fear. He gave his master a look\nthat was both imploring and reproachful.\n\n\"'I have served you day after day and done your bidding,' he seemed to\nsay. 'Will you not follow me this one night?'\n\n\"The dean was touched by the appeal in the animal's eyes. It was clear\nthat the horse needed his help to-night, in one way or another. Being a\nman through and through, the dean promptly determined to follow him.\nWithout further delay he sprang into the saddle. 'Go on!' he said. 'I\nwill not desert you since you want me. No one shall say of the dean in\nDelsbo that he refused to accompany any creature who was in trouble.'\n\n\"He let the horse go as he wished and thought only of keeping his seat.\nIt proved to be a hazardous and troublesome journey--uphill most of the\nway. The forest was so thick that he could not see two feet ahead, but\nit appeared to him that they were ascending a high mountain. The horse\nclimbed perilous steeps. Had the dean been guiding, he should not have\nthought of riding over such ground.\n\n\"'Surely you don't intend to go up to Black's Ridge, do you?' laughed\nthe dean, who knew that was one of the highest peaks in H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland.\n\n\"During the ride he discovered that he and the horse were not the only\nones who were out that night. He heard stones roll down and branches\ncrackle, as if animals were breaking their way through the forest. He\nremembered that wolves were plentiful in that section and wondered if\nthe horse wished to lead him to an encounter with wild beasts.\n\n\"They mounted up and up, and the higher they went the more scattered\nwere the trees. At last they rode on almost bare highland, where the\ndean could look in every direction. He gazed out over immeasurable\ntracts of land, which went up and down in mountains and valleys covered\nwith sombre forests. It was so dark that he had difficulty in seeing any\norderly arrangement; but presently he could make out where he was.\n\n\"'Why of course it's Black's Ridge that I've come to!' he remarked to\nhimself. 'It can't be any other mountain, for there, in the west, I see\nJarv Island, and to the east the sea glitters around Ag Island. Toward\nthe north also I see something shiny. It must be Dellen. In the depths\nbelow me I see white smoke from Nian Falls. Yes, I'm up on Black's\nRidge. What an adventure!'\n\n\"When they were at the summit the horse stopped behind a thick pine, as\nif to hide. The dean bent forward and pushed aside the branches, that he\nmight have an unobstructed view.\n\n\"The mountain's bald plate confronted him. It was not empty and\ndesolate, as he had anticipated. In the middle of the open space was an\nimmense boulder around which many wild beasts had gathered. Apparently\nthey were holding a conclave of some sort.\n\n\"Near to the big rock he saw bears, so firmly and heavily built that\nthey seemed like fur-clad blocks of stone. They were lying down and\ntheir little eyes blinked impatiently; it was obvious that they had come\nfrom their winter sleep to attend court, and that they could hardly keep\nawake. Behind them, in tight rows, were hundreds of wolves. They were\nnot sleepy, for wolves are more alert in winter than in summer. They sat\nupon their haunches, like dogs, whipping the ground with their tails and\npanting--their tongues lolling far out of their jaws. Behind the wolves\nthe lynx skulked, stiff-legged and clumsy, like misshapen cats. They\nwere loath to be among the other beasts, and hissed and spat when one\ncame near them. The row back of the lynx was occupied by the wolverines,\nwith dog faces and bear coats. They were not happy on the ground, and\nthey stamped their pads impatiently, longing to get into the trees.\nBehind them, covering the entire space to the forest border, leaped the\nfoxes, the weasels, and the martens. These were small and perfectly\nformed, but they looked even more savage and bloodthirsty than the\nlarger beasts.\n\n\"All this the dean plainly saw, for the whole place was illuminated.\nUpon the huge rock at the centre was the Wood-nymph, who held in her\nhand a pine torch which burned in a big red flame. The Nymph was as tall\nas the tallest tree in the forest. She wore a spruce-brush mantle and\nhad spruce-cone hair. She stood very still, her face turned toward the\nforest. She was watching and listening.\n\n\"The dean saw everything as plain as plain could be, but his\nastonishment was so great that he tried to combat it, and would not\nbelieve the evidence of his own eyes.\n\n\"'Such things cannot possibly happen!' he thought. 'I have ridden much\ntoo long in the bleak forest. This is only an optical illusion.'\n\n\"Nevertheless he gave the closest attention to the spectacle, and\nwondered what was about to be done.\n\n\"He hadn't long to wait before he caught the sound of a familiar bell,\ncoming from the depths of the forest, and the next moment he heard\nfootfalls and crackling of branches--as when many animals break through\nthe forest.\n\n\"A big herd of cattle was climbing the mountain. They came through the\nforest in the order in which they had marched to the mountain ranches.\nFirst came the bell cow followed by the bull, then the other cows and\nthe calves. The sheep, closely herded, followed. After them came the\ngoats, and last were the horses and colts. The sheep-dog trotted along\nbeside the sheep; but neither shepherd nor shepherdess attended them.\n\n\"The dean thought it heart-rending to see the tame animals coming\nstraight toward the wild beasts. He would gladly have blocked their way\nand called 'Halt!' but he understood that it was not within human power\nto stop the march of the cattle on this night; therefore he made no\nmove.\n\n\"The domestic animals were in a state of torment over that which they\nhad to face. If it happened to be the bell cow's turn, she advanced with\ndrooping head and faltering step. The goats had no desire either to play\nor to butt. The horses tried to bear up bravely, but their bodies were\nall of a quiver with fright. The most pathetic of all was the sheep-dog.\nHe kept his tail between his legs and crawled on the ground.\n\n\"The bell cow led the procession all the way up to the Wood-nymph, who\nstood on the boulder at the top of the mountain. The cow walked around\nthe rock and then turned toward the forest without any of the wild\nbeasts touching her. In the same way all the cattle walked unmolested\npast the wild beasts.\n\n\"As the creatures filed past, the dean saw the Wood-nymph lower her pine\ntorch over one and another of them.\n\n\"Every time this occurred the beasts of prey broke into loud, exultant\nroars--particularly when it was lowered over a cow or some other large\ncreature. The animal that saw the torch turning toward it uttered a\npiercing shriek, as if it had received a knife thrust in its flesh,\nwhile the entire herd to which it belonged bellowed their lamentations.\n\n\"Then the dean began to comprehend the meaning of what he saw. Surely he\nhad heard that the animals in Delsbo assembled on Black's Ridge every\nNew Year's Eve, that the Wood-nymph might mark out which among the tame\nbeasts would that year be prey for the wild beasts. The dean pitied the\npoor creatures that were at the mercy of savage beasts, when in reality\nthey should have no master but man.\n\n\"The leading herd had only just left when another bell tinkled, and the\ncattle from another farm tramped to the mountain top. These came in the\nsame order as the first and marched past the Wood-nymph, who stood\nthere, stern and solemn, indicating animal after animal for death.\n\n\"Herd upon herd followed, without a break in the line of procession.\nSome were so small that they included only one cow and a few sheep;\nothers consisted of only a pair of goats. It was apparent that these\nwere from very humble homes, but they too were compelled to pass in\nreview.\n\n\"The dean thought of the Delsbo farmers, who had so much love for their\nbeasts. 'Did they but know of it, surely they would not allow a\nrepetition of this!' he thought. 'They would risk their own lives rather\nthan let their cattle wander amongst bears and wolves, to be doomed by\nthe Wood-nymph!'\n\n\"The last herd to appear was the one from the rectory farm. The dean\nheard the sound of the familiar bell a long way off. The horse, too,\nmust have heard it, for he began to shake in every limb, and was bathed\nin sweat.\n\n\"'So it is your turn now to pass before the Wood-nymph to receive your\nsentence,' the dean said to the horse. 'Don't be afraid! Now I know why\nyou brought me here, and I shall not leave you.'\n\n\"The fine cattle from the parsonage farm emerged from the forest and\nmarched to the Wood-nymph and the wild beasts. Last in the line was the\nhorse that had brought his master to Black's Ridge. The dean did not\nleave the saddle, but let the animal take him to the Wood-nymph.\n\n\"He had neither knife nor gun for his defence, but he had taken out the\nPrayer-book and sat pressing it to his heart as he exposed himself to\nbattle against evil.\n\n\"At first it appeared as if none had observed him. The dean's cattle\nfiled past the Wood-nymph in the same order as the others had done. She\ndid not wave the torch toward any of these, but as soon as the\nintelligent horse stepped forward, she made a movement to mark him for\ndeath.\n\n\"Instantly the dean held up the Prayer-book, and the torchlight fell\nupon the cross on its cover. The Wood-nymph uttered a loud, shrill cry\nand let the torch drop from her hand.\n\n\"Immediately the flame was extinguished. In the sudden transition from\nlight to darkness the dean saw nothing, nor did he hear anything. About\nhim reigned the profound stillness of a wilderness in winter.\n\n\"Then the dark clouds parted, and through the opening stepped the full\nround moon to shed its light upon the ground. The dean saw that he and\nthe horse were alone on the summit of Black's Ridge. Not one of the many\nwild beasts was there. The ground had not been trampled by the herds\nthat had passed over it; but the dean himself sat with his Prayer-book\nbefore him, while the horse under him stood trembling and foaming.\n\n\"By the time the dean reached home he no longer knew whether or not it\nhad been a dream, a vision, or reality--this that he had seen; but he\ntook it as a warning to him to remember the poor creatures who were at\nthe mercy of wild beasts. He preached so powerfully to the Delsbo\npeasants that in his day all the wolves and bears were exterminated from\nthat section of the country, although they may have returned since his\ntime.\"\n\nHere Bernhard ended his story. He received praise from all sides and it\nseemed to be a foregone conclusion that he would get the prize. The\nmajority thought it almost a pity that Clement had to compete with him.\n\nBut Clement, undaunted, began:\n\n\"One day, while I was living at Skansen, just outside of Stockholm, and\nlonging for home--\" Then he told about the tiny midget he had ransomed\nso that he would not have to be confined in a cage, to be stared at by\nall the people. He told, also, that no sooner had he performed this act\nof mercy than he was rewarded for it. He talked and talked, and the\nastonishment of his hearers grew greater and greater; but when he came\nto the royal lackey and the beautiful book, all the dairymaids dropped\ntheir needle-work and sat staring at Clement in open-eyed wonder at his\nmarvellous experiences.\n\nAs soon as Clement had finished, the eldest of the dairymaids announced\nthat he should have the muffler.\n\n\"Bernhard related only things that happened to another, but Clement has\nhimself been the hero of a true story, which I consider far more\nimportant.\"\n\nIn this all concurred. They regarded Clement with very different eyes\nafter hearing that he had talked with the King, and the little fiddler\nwas afraid to show how proud he felt. But at the very height of his\nelation some one asked him what had become of the midget.\n\n\"I had no time to set out the blue bowl for him myself,\" said Clement,\n\"so I asked the old Laplander to do it. What has become of him since\nthen I don't know.\"\n\nNo sooner had he spoken than a little pine cone came along and struck\nhim on the nose. It did not drop from a tree, and none of the peasants\nhad thrown it. It was simply impossible to tell whence it had come.\n\n\"Aha, Clement!\" winked the dairymaid, \"it appears as if the tiny folk\nwere listening to us. You should not have left it to another to set out\nthat blue bowl!\"\n\n\nIN MEDELPAD\n\n\n_Friday, June seventeenth_.\n\nThe boy and the eagle were out bright and early the next morning. Gorgo\nhoped that he would get far up into West Bothnia that day. As luck would\nhave it, he heard the boy remark to himself that in a country like the\none through which they were now travelling it must be impossible for\npeople to live.\n\nThe land which spread below them was Southern Medelpad. When the eagle\nheard the boy's remark, he replied:\n\n\"Up here they have forests for fields.\"\n\nThe boy thought of the contrast between the light, golden-rye fields\nwith their delicate blades that spring up in one summer, and the dark\nspruce forest with its solid trees which took many years to ripen for\nharvest.\n\n\"One who has to get his livelihood from such a field must have a deal of\npatience!\" he observed.\n\nNothing more was said until they came to a place where the forest had\nbeen cleared, and the ground was covered with stumps and lopped-off\nbranches. As they flew over this ground, the eagle heard the boy mutter\nto himself that it was a mighty ugly and poverty-stricken place.\n\n\"This field was cleared last winter,\" said the eagle.\n\nThe boy thought of the harvesters at home, who rode on their reaping\nmachines on fine summer mornings, and in a short time mowed a large\nfield. But the forest field was harvested in winter. The lumbermen went\nout in the wilderness when the snow was deep, and the cold most severe.\nIt was tedious work to fell even one tree, and to hew down a forest such\nas this they must have been out in the open many weeks.\n\n\"They have to be hardy men to mow a field of this kind,\" he said.\n\nWhen the eagle had taken two more wing strokes, they sighted a log cabin\nat the edge of the clearing. It had no windows and only two loose boards\nfor a door. The roof had been covered with bark and twigs, but now it\nwas gaping, and the boy could see that inside the cabin there were only\na few big stones to serve as a fireplace, and two board benches. When\nthey were above the cabin the eagle suspected that the boy was wondering\nwho could have lived in such a wretched hut as that.\n\n\"The reapers who mowed the forest field lived there,\" the eagle said.\n\nThe boy remembered how the reapers in his home had returned from their\nday's work, cheerful and happy, and how the best his mother had in the\nlarder was always spread for them; while here, after the arduous work of\nthe day, they must rest on hard benches in a cabin that was worse than\nan outhouse. And what they had to eat he could not imagine.\n\n\"I wonder if there are any harvest festivals for these labourers?\" he\nquestioned.\n\nA little farther on they saw below them a wretchedly bad road winding\nthrough the forest. It was narrow and zigzag, hilly and stony, and cut\nup by brooks in many places. As they flew over it the eagle knew that\nthe boy was wondering what was carted over a road like that.\n\n\"Over this road the harvest was conveyed to the stack,\" the eagle said.\n\nThe boy recalled what fun they had at home when the harvest wagons\ndrawn by two sturdy horses, carried the grain from the field. The man\nwho drove sat proudly on top of the load; the horses danced and pricked\nup their ears, while the village children, who were allowed to climb\nupon the sheaves, sat there laughing and shrieking, half-pleased,\nhalf-frightened. But here the great logs were drawn up and down steep\nhills; here the poor horses must be worked to their limit, and the\ndriver must often be in peril. \"I'm afraid there has been very little\ncheer along this road,\" the boy observed.\n\nThe eagle flew on with powerful wing strokes, and soon they came to a\nriver bank covered with logs, chips, and bark. The eagle perceived that\nthe boy wondered why it looked so littered up down there.\n\n\"Here the harvest has been stacked,\" the eagle told him.\n\nThe boy thought of how the grain stacks in his part of the country were\npiled up close to the farms, as if they were their greatest ornaments,\nwhile here the harvest was borne to a desolate river strand, and left\nthere.\n\n\"I wonder if any one out in this wilderness counts his stacks, and\ncompares them with his neighbour's?\" he said.\n\nA little later they came to Ljungen, a river which glides through a\nbroad valley. Immediately everything was so changed that they might well\nthink they had come to another country. The dark spruce forest had\nstopped on the inclines above the valley, and the slopes were clad in\nlight-stemmed birches and aspens. The valley was so broad that in many\nplaces the river widened into lakes. Along the shores lay a large\nflourishing town.\n\nAs they soared above the valley the eagle realized that the boy was\nwondering if the fields and meadows here could provide a livelihood for\nso many people.\n\n\"Here live the reapers who mow the forest fields,\" the eagle said.\n\nThe boy was thinking of the lowly cabins and the hedged-in farms down in\nSk\u00c3\u00a5ne when he exclaimed:\n\n\"Why, here the peasants live in real manors. It looks as if it might be\nworth one's while to work in the forest!\"\n\nThe eagle had intended to travel straight north, but when he had flown\nout over the river he understood that the boy wondered who handled the\ntimber after it was stacked on the river bank.\n\nThe boy recollected how careful they had been at home never to let a\ngrain be wasted, while here were great rafts of logs floating down the\nriver, uncared for. He could not believe that more than half of the logs\never reached their destination. Many were floating in midstream, and for\nthem all went smoothly; others moved close to the shore, bumping against\npoints of land, and some were left behind in the still waters of the\ncreeks. On the lakes there were so many logs that they covered the\nentire surface of the water. These appeared to be lodged for an\nindefinite period. At the bridges they stuck; in the falls they were\nbunched, then they were pyramided and broken in two; afterward, in the\nrapids, they were blocked by the stones and massed into great heaps.\n\n\"I wonder how long it takes for the logs to get to the mill?\" said the\nboy.\n\nThe eagle continued his slow flight down River Ljungen. Over many places\nhe paused in the air on outspread wings, that the boy might see how this\nkind of harvest work was done.\n\nPresently they came to a place where the loggers were at work. The eagle\nmarked that the boy wondered what they were doing.\n\n\"They are the ones who take care of all the belated harvest,\" the eagle\nsaid.\n\nThe boy remembered the perfect ease with which his people at home had\ndriven their grain to the mill. Here the men ran alongside the shores\nwith long boat-hooks, and with toil and effort urged the logs along.\nThey waded out in the river and were soaked from top to toe. They jumped\nfrom stone to stone far out into the rapids, and they tramped on the\nrolling log heaps as calmly as though they were on flat ground. They\nwere daring and resolute men.\n\n\"As I watch this, I'm reminded of the iron-moulders in the mining\ndistricts, who juggle with fire as if it were perfectly harmless,\"\nremarked the boy. \"These loggers play with water as if they were its\nmasters. They seem to have subjugated it so that it dare not harm them.\"\n\nGradually they neared the mouth of the river, and Bothnia Bay was beyond\nthem. Gorgo flew no farther straight ahead, but went northward along the\ncoast. Before they had travelled very far they saw a lumber camp as\nlarge as a small city. While the eagle circled back and forth above it,\nhe heard the boy remark that this place looked interesting.\n\n\"Here you have the great lumber camp called Svartvik,\" the eagle said.\n\nThe boy thought of the mill at home, which stood peacefully embedded in\nfoliage, and moved its wings very slowly. This mill, where they grind\nthe forest harvest, stood on the water.\n\nThe mill pond was crowded with logs. One by one the helpers seized them\nwith their cant-hooks, crowded them into the chutes and hurried them\nalong to the whirling saws. What happened to the logs inside, the boy\ncould not see, but he heard loud buzzing and roaring, and from the other\nend of the house small cars ran out, loaded with white planks. The cars\nran on shining tracks down to the lumber yard, where the planks were\npiled in rows, forming streets--like blocks of houses in a city. In one\nplace they were building new piles; in another they were pulling down\nold ones. These were carried aboard two large vessels which lay waiting\nfor cargo. The place was alive with workmen, and in the woods, back of\nthe yard, they had their homes.\n\n\"They'll soon manage to saw up all the forests in Medelpad the way they\nwork here,\" said the boy.\n\nThe eagle moved his wings just a little, and carried the boy above\nanother large camp, very much like the first, with the mill, yard,\nwharf, and the homes of the workmen.\n\n\"This is called Kukikenborg,\" the eagle said.\n\nHe flapped his wings slowly, flew past two big lumber camps, and\napproached a large city. When the eagle heard the boy ask the name of\nit, he cried; \"This is Sundsvall, the manor of the lumber districts.\"\n\nThe boy remembered the cities of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, which looked so old and gray and\nsolemn; while here in the bleak North the city of Sundsvall faced a\nbeautiful bay, and looked young and happy and beaming. There was\nsomething odd about the city when one saw it from above, for in the\nmiddle stood a cluster of tall stone structures which looked so imposing\nthat their match was hardly to be found in Stockholm. Around the stone\nbuildings there was a large open space, then came a wreath of frame\nhouses which looked pretty and cosy in their little gardens; but they\nseemed to be conscious of the fact that they were very much poorer than\nthe stone houses, and dared not venture into their neighbourhood.\n\n\"This must be both a wealthy and powerful city,\" remarked the boy. \"Can\nit be possible that the poor forest soil is the source of all this?\"\n\nThe eagle flapped his wings again, and went over to Aln Island, which\nlies opposite Sundsvall. The boy was greatly surprised to see all the\nsawmills that decked the shores. On Aln Island they stood, one next\nanother, and on the mainland opposite were mill upon mill, lumber yard\nupon lumber yard. He counted forty, at least, but believed there were\nmany more.\n\n\"How wonderful it all looks from up here!\" he marvelled. \"So much life\nand activity I have not seen in any place save this on the whole trip.\nIt is a great country that we have! Wherever I go, there is always\nsomething new for people to live upon.\"\n\n\nA MORNING IN \u00c3\u0085NGERMANLAND\n\n\nTHE BREAD\n\n_Saturday, June eighteenth_.\n\nNext morning, when the eagle had flown some distance into \u00c3\u0085ngermanland,\nhe remarked that to-day he was the one who was hungry, and must find\nsomething to eat! He set the boy down in an enormous pine on a high\nmountain ridge, and away he flew.\n\nThe boy found a comfortable seat in a cleft branch from which he could\nlook down over \u00c3\u0085ngermanland. It was a glorious morning! The sunshine\ngilded the treetops; a soft breeze played in the pine needles; the\nsweetest fragrance was wafted through the forest; a beautiful landscape\nspread before him; and the boy himself was happy and care-free. He felt\nthat no one could be better off.\n\nHe had a perfect outlook in every direction. The country west of him was\nall peaks and table-land, and the farther away they were, the higher and\nwilder they looked. To the east there were also many peaks, but these\nsank lower and lower toward the sea, where the land became perfectly\nflat. Everywhere he saw shining rivers and brooks which were having a\ntroublesome journey with rapids and falls so long as they ran between\nmountains, but spread out clear and broad as they neared the shore of\nthe coast. Bothnia Bay was dotted with islands and notched with points,\nbut farther out was open, blue water, like a summer sky.\n\nWhen the boy had had enough of the landscape he unloosed his knapsack,\ntook out a morsel of fine white bread, and began to eat.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever tasted such good bread,\" said he. \"And how much\nI have left! There's enough to last me for a couple of days.\" As he\nmunched he thought of how he had come by the bread.\n\n\"It must be because I got it in such a nice way that it tastes so good\nto me,\" he said.\n\nThe golden eagle had left Medelpad the evening before. He had hardly\ncrossed the border into \u00c3\u0085ngermanland when the boy caught a glimpse of a\nfertile valley and a river, which surpassed anything of the kind he had\nseen before.\n\nAs the boy glanced down at the rich valley, he complained of feeling\nhungry. He had had no food for two whole days, he said, and now he was\nfamished. Gorgo did not wish to have it said that the boy had fared\nworse in his company than when he travelled with the wild geese, so he\nslackened his speed.\n\n\"Why haven't you spoken of this before?\" he asked. \"You shall have all\nthe food you want. There's no need of your starving when you have an\neagle for a travelling companion.\"\n\nJust then the eagle sighted a farmer who was sowing a field near the\nriver strand. The man carried the seeds in a basket suspended from his\nneck, and each time that it was emptied he refilled it from a seed sack\nwhich stood at the end of the furrow. The eagle reasoned it out that the\nsack must be filled with the best food that the boy could wish for, so\nhe darted toward it. But before the bird could get there a terrible\nclamour arose about him. Sparrows, crows, and swallows came rushing up\nwith wild shrieks, thinking that the eagle meant to swoop down upon some\nbird.\n\n\"Away, away, robber! Away, away, bird-killer!\" they cried. They made\nsuch a racket that it attracted the farmer, who came running, so that\nGorgo had to flee, and the boy got no seed.\n\nThe small birds behaved in the most extraordinary manner. Not only did\nthey force the eagle to flee, they pursued him a long distance down the\nvalley, and everywhere the people heard their cries. Women came out and\nclapped their hands so that it sounded like a volley of musketry, and\nthe men rushed out with rifles.\n\nThe same thing was repeated every time the eagle swept toward the\nground. The boy abandoned the hope that the eagle could procure any food\nfor him. It had never occurred to him before that Gorgo was so much\nhated. He almost pitied him.\n\nIn a little while they came to a homestead where the housewife had just\nbeen baking. She had set a platter of sugared buns in the back yard to\ncool and was standing beside it, watching, so that the cat and dog\nshould not steal the buns.\n\nThe eagle circled down to the yard, but dared not alight right under the\neyes of the peasant woman. He flew up and down, irresolute; twice he\ncame down as far as the chimney, then rose again.\n\nThe peasant woman noticed the eagle. She raised her head and followed\nhim with her glance.\n\n\"How peculiarly he acts!\" she remarked. \"I believe he wants one of my\nbuns.\"\n\nShe was a beautiful woman, tall and fair, with a cheery, open\ncountenance. Laughing heartily, she took a bun from the platter, and\nheld it above her head.\n\n\"If you want it, come and take it!\" she challenged.\n\nWhile the eagle did not understand her language, he knew at once that\nshe was offering him the bun. With lightning speed, he swooped to the\nbread, snatched it, and flew toward the heights.\n\nWhen the boy saw the eagle snatch the bread he wept for joy--not because\nhe would escape suffering hunger for a few days, but because he was\ntouched by the peasant woman's sharing her bread with a savage bird of\nprey.\n\nWhere he now sat on the pine branch he could recall at will the tall,\nfair woman as she stood in the yard and held up the bread.\n\nShe must have known that the large bird was a golden eagle--a plunderer,\nwho was usually welcomed with loud shots; doubtless she had also seen\nthe queer changeling he bore on his back. But she had not thought of\nwhat they were. As soon as she understood that they were hungry, she\nshared her good bread with them.\n\n\"If I ever become human again,\" thought the boy, \"I shall look up the\npretty woman who lives near the great river, and thank her for her\nkindness to us.\"\n\nTHE FOREST FIRE\n\nWhile the boy was still at his breakfast he smelled a faint odour of\nsmoke coming from the north. He turned and saw a tiny spiral, white as a\nmist, rise from a forest ridge--not from the one nearest him, but from\nthe one beyond it. It looked strange to see smoke in the wild forest,\nbut it might be that a mountain stock farm lay over yonder, and the\nwomen were boiling their morning coffee.\n\nIt was remarkable the way that smoke increased and spread! It could not\ncome from a ranch, but perhaps there were charcoal kilns in the forest.\n\nThe smoke increased every moment. Now it curled over the whole mountain\ntop. It was not possible that so much smoke could come from a charcoal\nkiln. There must be a conflagration of some sort, for many birds flew\nover to the nearest ridge. Hawks, grouse, and other birds, who were so\nsmall that it was impossible to recognize them at such a distance, fled\nfrom the fire.\n\nThe tiny white spiral of smoke grew to a thick white cloud which rolled\nover the edge of the ridge and sank toward the valley. Sparks and flakes\nof soot shot up from the clouds, and here and there one could see a red\nflame in the smoke. A big fire was raging over there, but what was\nburning? Surely there was no large farm hidden in the forest.\n\nThe source of such a fire must be more than a farm. Now the smoke came\nnot only from the ridge, but from the valley below it, which the boy\ncould not see, because the next ridge obstructed his view. Great clouds\nof smoke ascended; the forest itself was burning!\n\nIt was difficult for him to grasp the idea that the fresh, green pines\ncould burn. If it really were the forest that was burning, perhaps the\nfire might spread all the way over to him. It seemed improbable; but he\nwished the eagle would soon return. It would be best to be away from\nthis. The mere smell of the smoke which he drew in with every breath was\na torture.\n\nAll at once he heard a terrible crackling and sputtering. It came from\nthe ridge nearest him. There, on the highest point, stood a tall pine\nlike the one in which he sat. A moment before it had been a gorgeous red\nin the morning light. Now all the needles flashed, and the pine caught\nfire. Never before had it looked so beautiful! But this was the last\ntime it could exhibit any beauty, for the pine was the first tree on the\nridge to burn. It was impossible to tell how the flames had reached it.\nHad the fire flown on red wings, or crawled along the ground like a\nsnake? It was not easy to say, but there it was at all events. The great\npine burned like a birch stem.\n\nAh, look! Now smoke curled up in many places on the ridge. The forest\nfire was both bird and snake. It could fly in the air over wide\nstretches, or steal along the ground. The whole ridge was ablaze!\n\nThere was a hasty flight of birds that circled up through the smoke like\nbig flakes of soot. They flew across the valley and came to the ridge\nwhere the boy sat. A horned owl perched beside him, and on a branch just\nabove him a hen hawk alighted. These would have been dangerous\nneighbours at any other time, but now they did not even glance in his\ndirection--only stared at the fire. Probably they could not make out\nwhat was wrong with the forest. A marten ran up the pine to the tip of a\nbranch, and looked at the burning heights. Close beside the marten sat a\nsquirrel, but they did not appear to notice each other.\n\nNow the fire came rushing down the slope, hissing and roaring like a\ntornado. Through the smoke one could see the flames dart from tree to\ntree. Before a branch caught fire it was first enveloped in a thin veil\nof smoke, then all the needles grew red at one time, and it began to\ncrackle and blaze.\n\nIn the glen below ran a little brook, bordered by elms and small\nbirches. It appeared as if the flames would halt there. Leafy trees are\nnot so ready to take fire as fir trees. The fire did pause as if before\na gate that could stop it. It glowed and crackled and tried to leap\nacross the brook to the pine woods on the other side, but could not\nreach them.\n\nFor a short time the fire was thus restrained, then it shot a long\nflame over to the large, dry pine that stood on the slope, and this was\nsoon ablaze. The fire had crossed the brook! The heat was so intense\nthat every tree on the mountain was ready to burn. With the roar and\nrush of the maddest storm and the wildest torrent the forest fire flew\nover to the ridge.\n\nThen the hawk and the owl rose and the marten dashed down the tree. In a\nfew seconds more the fire would reach the top of the pine, and the boy,\ntoo, would have to be moving. It was not easy to slide down the long,\nstraight pine trunk. He took as firm a hold of it as he could, and slid\nin long stretches between the knotty branches; finally he tumbled\nheadlong to the ground. He had no time to find out if he was hurt--only\nto hurry away. The fire raced down the pine like a raging tempest; the\nground under his feet was hot and smouldering. On either side of him ran\na lynx and an adder, and right beside the snake fluttered a mother\ngrouse who was hurrying along with her little downy chicks.\n\nWhen the refugees descended the mountain to the glen they met people\nfighting the fire. They had been there for some time, but the boy had\nbeen gazing so intently in the direction of the fire that he had not\nnoticed them before.\n\nIn this glen there was a brook, bordered by a row of leaf trees, and\nback of these trees the people worked. They felled the fir trees nearest\nthe elms, dipped water from the brook and poured it over the ground,\nwashing away heather and myrtle to prevent the fire from stealing up to\nthe birch brush.\n\nThey, too, thought only of the fire which was now rushing toward them.\nThe fleeing animals ran in and out among the men's feet, without\nattracting attention. No one struck at the adder or tried to catch the\nmother grouse as she ran back and forth with her little peeping\nbirdlings. They did not even bother about Thumbietot. In their hands\nthey held great, charred pine branches which had dropped into the brook,\nand it appeared as if they intended to challenge the fire with these\nweapons. There were not many men, and it was strange to see them stand\nthere, ready to fight, when all other living creatures were fleeing.\n\nAs the fire came roaring and rushing down the slope with its intolerable\nheat and suffocating smoke, ready to hurl itself over brook and\nleaf-tree wall in order to reach the opposite shore without having to\npause, the people drew back at first as if unable to withstand it; but\nthey did not flee far before they turned back.\n\nThe conflagration raged with savage force, sparks poured like a rain of\nfire over the leaf trees, and long tongues of flame shot hissingly out\nfrom the smoke, as if the forest on the other side were sucking them in.\n\nBut the leaf-tree wall was an obstruction behind which the men worked.\nWhen the ground began to smoulder they brought water in their vessels\nand dampened it. When a tree became wreathed in smoke they felled it at\nonce, threw it down and put out the flames. Where the fire crept along\nthe heather, they beat it with the wet pine branches and smothered it.\n\nThe smoke was so dense that it enveloped everything. One could not\npossibly see how the battle was going, but it was easy enough to\nunderstand that it was a hard fight, and that several times the fire\ncame near penetrating farther.\n\nBut think! After a while the loud roar of the flames decreased, and the\nsmoke cleared. By that time the leaf trees had lost all their foliage,\nthe ground under them was charred, the faces of the men were blackened\nby smoke and dripping with sweat; but the forest fire was conquered. It\nhad ceased to flame up. Soft white smoke crept along the ground, and\nfrom it peeped out a lot of black stumps. This was all there was left of\nthe beautiful forest!\n\nThe boy scrambled up on a rock, so that he might see how the fire had\nbeen quenched. But now that the forest was saved, his peril began. The\nowl and the hawk simultaneously turned their eyes toward him. Just then\nhe heard a familiar voice calling to him.\n\nGorgo, the golden eagle, came sweeping through the forest, and soon the\nboy was soaring among the clouds--rescued from every peril.\n\n\nWESTBOTTOM AND LAPLAND\n\n\nTHE FIVE SCOUTS\n\nOnce, at Skansen, the boy had sat under the steps at Bolln\u00c3\u00a4s cottage and\nhad overheard Clement Larsson and the old Laplander talk about Norrland.\nBoth agreed that it was the most beautiful part of Sweden. Clement\nthought that the southern part was the best, while the Laplander\nfavoured the northern part.\n\nAs they argued, it became plain that Clement had never been farther\nnorth than H\u00c3\u00a4rn\u00c3\u00b6sand. The Laplander laughed at him for speaking with\nsuch assurance of places that he had never seen.\n\n\"I think I shall have to tell you a story, Clement, to give you some\nidea of Lapland, since you have not seen it,\" volunteered the Laplander.\n\n\"It shall not be said of me that I refuse to listen to a story,\"\nretorted Clement, and the old Laplander began:\n\n\"It once happened that the birds who lived down in Sweden, south of the\ngreat Sam\u00c3\u00a9land, thought that they were overcrowded there and suggested\nmoving northward.\n\n\"They came together to consider the matter. The young and eager birds\nwished to start at once, but the older and wiser ones passed a\nresolution to send scouts to explore the new country.\n\n\"'Let each of the five great bird families send out a scout,' said the\nold and wise birds, 'to learn if there is room for us all up there--food\nand hiding places.'\n\n\"Five intelligent and capable birds were immediately appointed by the\nfive great bird families.\n\n\"The forest birds selected a grouse, the field birds a lark, the sea\nbirds a gull, the fresh-water birds a loon, and the cliff birds a snow\nsparrow.\n\n\"When the five chosen ones were ready to start, the grouse, who was the\nlargest and most commanding, said:\n\n\"'There are great stretches of land ahead. If we travel together, it\nwill be long before we cover all the territory that we must explore. If,\non the other hand, we travel singly--each one exploring his special\nportion of the country--the whole business can be accomplished in a few\ndays.'\n\n\"The other scouts thought the suggestion a good one, and agreed to act\nupon it.\n\n\"It was decided that the grouse should explore the midlands. The lark\nwas to travel to the eastward, the sea gull still farther east, where\nthe land bordered on the sea, while the loon should fly over the\nterritory west of the midlands, and the snow sparrow to the extreme\nwest.\n\n\"In accordance with this plan, the five birds flew over the whole\nNorthland. Then they turned back and told the assembly of birds what\nthey had discovered.\n\n\"The gull, who had travelled along the sea-coast, spoke first.\n\n\"'The North is a fine country,' he said. 'The sounds are full of fish,\nand there are points and islands without number. Most of these are\nuninhabited, and the birds will find plenty of room there. The humans\ndo a little fishing and sailing in the sounds, but not enough to disturb\nthe birds. If the sea birds follow my advice, they will move north\nimmediately.'\n\n\"When the gull had finished, the lark, who had explored the land back\nfrom the coast, spoke:\n\n\"'I don't know what the gull means by his islands and points,' said the\nlark. I have travelled only over great fields and flowery meadows. I\nhave never before seen a country crossed by some large streams. Their\nshores are dotted with homesteads, and at the mouth of the rivers are\ncities; but for the most part the country is very desolate. If the field\nbirds follow my advice, they will move north immediately.'\n\n\"After the lark came the grouse, who had flown over the midlands.\n\n\"'I know neither what the lark means with his meadows nor the gull with\nhis islands and points,' said he. 'I have seen only pine forests on this\nwhole trip. There are also many rushing streams and great stretches of\nmoss-grown swamp land; but all that is not river or swamp is forest. If\nthe forest birds follow my advice, they will move north immediately.'\n\n\"After the grouse came the loon, who had explored the borderland to the\nwest.\n\n\"I don't know what the grouse means by his forests, nor do I know where\nthe eyes of the lark and the gull could have been,' remarked the loon.\nThere's hardly any land up there--only big lakes. Between beautiful\nshores glisten clear, blue mountain lakes, which pour into roaring\nwater-falls. If the fresh-water birds follow my advice, they will move\nnorth immediately.'\n\n\"The last speaker was the snow sparrow, who had flown along the western\nboundary.\n\n\"'I don't know what the loon means by his lakes, nor do I know what\ncountries the grouse, the lark, and the gull can have seen,' he said. 'I\nfound one vast mountainous region up north. I didn't run across any\nfields or any pine forests, but peak after peak and highlands. I have\nseen ice fields and snow and mountain brooks, with water as white as\nmilk. No farmers nor cattle nor homesteads have I seen, but only Lapps\nand reindeer and huts met my eyes. If the cliff birds follow my advice,\nthey will move north immediately.'\n\n\"When the five scouts had presented their reports to the assembly, they\nbegan to call one another liars, and were ready to fly at each other to\nprove the truth of their arguments.\n\n\"But the old and wise birds who had sent them out, listened to their\naccounts with joy, and calmed their fighting propensities.\n\n\"'You mustn't quarrel among yourselves,' they said. 'We understand from\nyour reports that up north there are large mountain tracts, a big lake\nregion, great forest lands, a wide plain, and a big group of islands.\nThis is more than we have expected--more than many a mighty kingdom can\nboast within its borders.'\"\n\nTHE MOVING LANDSCAPE\n\n_Saturday, June eighteenth_.\n\nThe boy had been reminded of the old Laplander's story because he\nhimself was now travelling over the country of which he had spoken. The\neagle told him that the expanse of coast which spread beneath them was\nWestbottom, and that the blue ridges far to the west were in Lapland.\n\nOnly to be once more seated comfortably on Gorgo's back, after all that\nhe had suffered during the forest fire, was a pleasure. Besides, they\nwere having a fine trip. The flight was so easy that at times it seemed\nas if they were standing still in the air. The eagle beat and beat his\nwings, without appearing to move from the spot; on the other hand,\neverything under them seemed in motion. The whole earth and all things\non it moved slowly southward. The forests, the fields, the fences, the\nrivers, the cities, the islands, the sawmills--all were on the march.\nThe boy wondered whither they were bound. Had they grown tired of\nstanding so far north, and wished to move toward the south?\n\nAmid all the objects in motion there was only one that stood still: that\nwas a railway train. It stood directly under them, for it was with the\ntrain as with Gorgo--it could not move from the spot. The locomotive\nsent forth smoke and sparks. The clatter of the wheels could be heard\nall the way up to the boy, but the train did not seem to move. The\nforests rushed by; the flag station rushed by; fences and telegraph\npoles rushed by; but the train stood still. A broad river with a long\nbridge came toward it, but the river and the bridge glided along under\nthe train with perfect ease. Finally a railway station appeared. The\nstation master stood on the platform with his red flag, and moved slowly\ntoward the train.\n\nWhen he waved his little flag, the locomotive belched even darker smoke\ncurls than before, and whistled mournfully because it had to stand\nstill. All of a sudden it began to move toward the south, like\neverything else.\n\nThe boy saw all the coach doors open and the passengers step out while\nboth cars and people were moving southward.\n\nHe glanced away from the earth and tried to look straight ahead. Staring\nat the queer railway train had made him dizzy; but after he had gazed\nfor a moment at a little white cloud, he was tired of that and looked\ndown again--thinking all the while that the eagle and himself were quite\nstill and that everything else was travelling on south. Fancy! Suppose\nthe grain field just then running along under him--which must have been\nnewly sown for he had seen a green blade on it--were to travel all the\nway down to Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne where the rye was in full bloom at this season!\n\nUp here the pine forests were different: the trees were bare, the\nbranches short and the needles were almost black. Many trees were bald\nat the top and looked sickly. If a forest like that were to journey down\nto Kolm\u00c3\u00a5rden and see a real forest, how inferior it would feel!\n\nThe gardens which he now saw had some pretty bushes, but no fruit trees\nor lindens or chestnut trees--only mountain ash and birch. There were\nsome vegetable beds, but they were not as yet hoed or planted.\n\n\"If such an apology for a garden were to come trailing into S\u00c3\u00b6rmland,\nthe province of gardens, wouldn't it think itself a poor wilderness by\ncomparison?\"\n\nImagine an immense plain like the one now gliding beneath him, coming\nunder the very eyes of the poor Sm\u00c3\u00a5land peasants! They would hurry away\nfrom their meagre garden plots and stony fields, to begin plowing and\nsowing.\n\nThere was one thing, however, of which this Northland had more than\nother lands, and that was light. Night must have set in, for the cranes\nstood sleeping on the morass; but it was as light as day. The sun had\nnot travelled southward, like every other thing. Instead, it had gone so\nfar north that it shone in the boy's face. To all appearance, it had no\nnotion of setting that night.\n\nIf this light and this sun were only shining on West Vemmenh\u00c3\u00b6g! It would\nsuit the boy's father and mother to a dot to have a working day that\nlasted twenty-four hours.\n\n_Sunday, June nineteenth_.\n\nThe boy raised his head and looked around, perfectly bewildered. It was\nmighty queer! Here he lay sleeping in some place where he had not been\nbefore. No, he had never seen this glen nor the mountains round about;\nand never had he noticed such puny and shrunken birches as those under\nwhich he now lay.\n\nWhere was the eagle? The boy could see no sign of him. Gorgo must have\ndeserted him. Well, here was another adventure!\n\nThe boy lay down again, closed his eyes, and tried to recall the\ncircumstances under which he had dropped to sleep.\n\nHe remembered that as long as he was travelling over Westbottom he had\nfancied that the eagle and he were at a standstill in the air, and that\nthe land under them was moving southward. As the eagle turned northwest,\nthe wind had come from that side, and again he had felt a current of\nair, so that the land below had stopped moving and he had noticed that\nthe eagle was bearing him onward with terrific speed.\n\n\"Now we are flying into Lapland,\" Gorgo had said, and the boy had bent\nforward, so that he might see the country of which he had heard so much.\n\nBut he had felt rather disappointed at not seeing anything but great\ntracts of forest land and wide marshes. Forest followed marsh and marsh\nfollowed forest. The monotony of the whole finally made him so sleepy\nthat he had nearly dropped to the ground.\n\nHe said to the eagle that he could not stay on his back another minute,\nbut must sleep awhile. Gorgo had promptly swooped to the ground, where\nthe boy had dropped down on a moss tuft. Then Gorgo put a talon around\nhim and soared into the air with him again.\n\n\"Go to sleep, Thumbietot!\" he cried. \"The sunshine keeps me awake and I\nwant to continue the journey.\"\n\nAlthough the boy hung in this uncomfortable position, he actually dozed\nand dreamed.\n\nHe dreamed that he was on a broad road in southern Sweden, hurrying\nalong as fast as his little legs could carry him. He was not alone, many\nwayfarers were tramping in the same direction. Close beside him marched\ngrain-filled rye blades, blossoming corn flowers, and yellow daisies.\nHeavily laden apple trees went puffing along, followed by vine-covered\nbean stalks, big clusters of white daisies, and masses of berry bushes.\nTall beeches and oaks and lindens strolled leisurely in the middle of\nthe road, their branches swaying, and they stepped aside for none.\nBetween the boy's tiny feet darted the little flowers--wild strawberry\nblossoms, white anemones, clover, and forget-me-nots. At first he\nthought that only the vegetable family was on the march, but presently\nhe saw that animals and people accompanied them. The insects were\nbuzzing around advancing bushes, the fishes were swimming in moving\nditches, the birds were singing in strolling trees. Both tame and wild\nbeasts were racing, and amongst all this people moved along--some with\nspades and scythes, others with axes, and others, again, with fishing\nnets.\n\nThe procession marched with gladness and gayety, and he did not wonder\nat that when he saw who was leading it. It was nothing less than the Sun\nitself that rolled on like a great shining head with hair of many-hued\nrays and a countenance beaming with merriment and kindliness!\n\n\"Forward, march!\" it kept calling out. \"None need feel anxious whilst I\nam here. Forward, march!\"\n\n\"I wonder where the Sun wants to take us to?\" remarked the boy. A rye\nblade that walked beside him heard him, and immediately answered:\n\n\"He wants to take us up to Lapland to fight the Ice Witch.\"\n\nPresently the boy noticed that some of the travellers hesitated, slowed\nup, and finally stood quite still. He saw that the tall beech tree\nstopped, and that the roebuck and the wheat blade tarried by the\nwayside, likewise the blackberry bush, the little yellow buttercup, the\nchestnut tree, and the grouse.\n\nHe glanced about him and tried to reason out why so many stopped. Then\nhe discovered that they were no longer in southern Sweden. The march had\nbeen so rapid that they were already in Svealand.\n\nUp there the oak began to move more cautiously. It paused awhile to\nconsider, took a few faltering steps, then came to a standstill.\n\n\"Why doesn't the oak come along?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"It's afraid of the Ice Witch,\" said a fair young birch that tripped\nalong so boldly and cheerfully that it was a joy to watch it. The crowd\nhurried on as before. In a short time they were in Norrland, and now it\nmattered not how much the Sun cried and coaxed--the apple tree stopped,\nthe cherry tree stopped, the rye blade stopped!\n\nThe boy turned to them and asked:\n\n\"Why don't you come along? Why do you desert the Sun?\"\n\n\"We dare not! We're afraid of the Ice Witch, who lives in Lapland,\" they\nanswered.\n\nThe boy comprehended that they were far north, as the procession grew\nthinner and thinner. The rye blade, the barley, the wild strawberry, the\nblueberry bush, the pea stalk, the currant bush had come along as far as\nthis. The elk and the domestic cow had been walking side by side, but\nnow they stopped. The Sun no doubt would have been almost deserted if\nnew followers had not happened along. Osier bushes and a lot of brushy\nvegetation joined the procession. Laps and reindeer, mountain owl and\nmountain fox and willow grouse followed.\n\nThen the boy heard something coming toward them. He saw great rivers and\ncreeks sweeping along with terrible force.\n\n\"Why are they in such a hurry?\" he asked.\n\n\"They are running away from the Ice Witch, who lives up in the\nmountains.\"\n\nAll of a sudden the boy saw before him a high, dark, turreted wall.\nInstantly the Sun turned its beaming face toward this wall and flooded\nit with light. Then it became apparent that it was no wall, but the most\nglorious mountains, which loomed up--one behind another. Their peaks\nwere rose-coloured in the sunlight, their slopes azure and gold-tinted.\n\n\"Onward, onward!\" urged the Sun as it climbed the steep cliffs. \"There's\nno danger so long as I am with you.\"\n\nBut half way up, the bold young birch deserted--also the sturdy pine and\nthe persistent spruce, and there, too, the Laplander, and the willow\nbrush deserted. At last, when the Sun reached the top, there was no one\nbut the little tot, Nils Holgersson, who had followed it.\n\nThe Sun rolled into a cave, where the walls were bedecked with ice, and\nNils Holgersson wanted to follow, but farther than the opening of the\ncave he dared not venture, for in there he saw something dreadful.\n\nFar back in the cave sat an old witch with an ice body, hair of icicles,\nand a mantle of snow!\n\nAt her feet lay three black wolves, who rose and opened their jaws when\nthe Sun approached. From the mouth of one came a piercing cold, from the\nsecond a blustering north wind, and from the third came impenetrable\ndarkness.\n\n\"That must be the Ice Witch and her tribe,\" thought the boy.\n\nHe understood that now was the time for him to flee, but he was so\ncurious to see the outcome of the meeting between the Sun and the Ice\nWitch that he tarried.\n\nThe Ice Witch did not move--only turned her hideous face toward the Sun.\nThis continued for a short time. It appeared to the boy that the witch\nwas beginning to sigh and tremble. Her snow mantle fell, and the three\nferocious wolves howled less savagely.\n\nSuddenly the Sun cried:\n\n\"Now my time is up!\" and rolled out of the cave.\n\nThen the Ice Witch let loose her three wolves. Instantly the North Wind,\nCold, and Darkness rushed from the cave and began to chase the Sun.\n\n\"Drive him out! Drive him back!\" shrieked the Ice Witch. \"Chase him so\nfar that he can never come back! Teach him that Lapland is MINE!\"\n\nBut Nils Holgersson felt so unhappy when he saw that the Sun was to be\ndriven from Lapland that he awakened with a cry. When he recovered his\nsenses, he found himself at the bottom of a ravine.\n\nBut where was Gorgo? How was he to find out where he himself was?\n\nHe arose and looked all around him. Then he happened to glance upward\nand saw a peculiar structure of pine twigs and branches that stood on a\ncliff-ledge.\n\n\"That must be one of those eagle nests that Gorgo--\" But this was as far\nas he got. He tore off his cap, waved it in the air, and cheered.\n\nNow he understood where Gorgo had brought him. This was the very glen\nwhere the wild geese lived in summer, and just above it was the eagles'\ncliff.\n\nHE HAD ARRIVED!\n\nHe would meet Morten Goosey-Gander and Akka and all the other comrades\nin a few moments. Hurrah!\n\nTHE MEETING\n\nAll was still in the glen. The sun had not yet stepped above the cliffs,\nand Nils Holgersson knew that it was too early in the morning for the\ngeese to be awake.\n\nThe boy walked along leisurely and searched for his friends. Before he\nhad gone very far, he paused with a smile, for he saw such a pretty\nsight. A wild goose was sleeping in a neat little nest, and beside her\nstood her goosey-gander. He too, slept, but it was obvious that he had\nstationed himself thus near her that he might be on hand in the possible\nevent of danger.\n\nThe boy went on without disturbing them and peeped into the willow brush\nthat covered the ground. It was not long before he spied another goose\ncouple. These were strangers, not of his flock, but he was so happy that\nhe began to hum--just because he had come across wild geese.\n\nHe peeped into another bit of brushwood. There at last he saw two that\nwere familiar.\n\nIt was certainly Nelj\u00c3\u00a4 that was nesting there, and the goosey-gander\nwho stood beside her was surely Kolme. Why, of course! The boy had a\ngood mind to awaken them, but he let them sleep on, and walked away.\n\nIn the next brush he saw Viisi and Kuusi, and not far from them he found\nYksi and Kaksi. All four were asleep, and the boy passed by without\ndisturbing them. As he approached the next brush, he thought he saw\nsomething white shimmering among the bushes, and the heart of him\nthumped with joy. Yes, it was as he expected. In there sat the dainty\nDunfin on an egg-filled nest. Beside her stood her white goosey-gander.\nAlthough he slept, it was easy to see how proud he was to watch over his\nwife up here among the Lapland mountains. The boy did not care to waken\nthe goosey-gander, so he walked on.\n\nHe had to seek a long time before he came across any more wild geese.\nFinally, he saw on a little hillock something that resembled a small,\ngray moss tuft, and he knew that there was Akka from Kebnekaise. She\nstood, wide awake, looking about as if she were keeping watch over the\nwhole glen.\n\n\"Good morning, Mother Akka!\" said the boy. \"Please don't waken the other\ngeese yet awhile, for I wish to speak with you in private.\"\n\nThe old leader-goose came rushing down the hill and up to the boy.\n\nFirst she seized hold of him and shook him, then she stroked him with\nher bill before she shook him again. But she did not say a word, since\nhe asked her not to waken the others.\n\nThumbietot kissed old Mother Akka on both cheeks, then he told her how\nhe had been carried off to Skansen and held captive there.\n\n\"Now I must tell you that Smirre Fox, short of an ear, sat imprisoned in\nthe foxes' cage at Skansen,\" said the boy. \"Although he was very mean to\nus, I couldn't help feeling sorry for him. There were many other foxes\nin the cage; and they seemed quite contented there, but Smirre sat all\nthe while looking dejected, longing for liberty.\n\n\"I made many good friends at Skansen, and I learned one day from the\nLapp dog that a man had come to Skansen to buy foxes. He was from some\nisland far out in the ocean. All the foxes had been exterminated there,\nand the rats were about to get the better of the inhabitants, so they\nwished the foxes back again.\n\n\"As soon as I learned of this, I went to Smirre's cage and said to him:\n\n\"'To-morrow some men are coming here to get a pair of foxes. Don't hide,\nSmirre, but keep well in the foreground and see to it that you are\nchosen. Then you'll be free again.'\n\n\"He followed my suggestion, and now he is running at large on the\nisland. What say you to this, Mother Akka? If you had been in my place,\nwould you not have done likewise?\"\n\n\"You have acted in a way that makes me wish I had done that myself,\"\nsaid the leader-goose proudly.\n\n\"It's a relief to know that you approve,\" said the boy. \"Now there is\none thing more I wish to ask you about:\n\n\"One day I happened to see Gorgo, the eagle--the one that fought with\nMorten Goosey-Gander--a prisoner at Skansen. He was in the eagles' cage\nand looked pitifully forlorn. I was thinking of filing down the wire\nroof over him and letting him out, but I also thought of his being a\ndangerous robber and bird-eater, and wondered if I should be doing right\nin letting loose such a plunderer, and if it were not better, perhaps,\nto let him stay where he was. What say you, Mother Akka? Was it right\nto think thus?\"\n\n\"No, it was not right!\" retorted Akka. \"Say what you will about the\neagles, they are proud birds and greater lovers of freedom than all\nothers. It is not right to keep them in captivity. Do you know what I\nwould suggest? This: that, as soon as you are well rested, we two make\nthe trip together to the big bird prison, and liberate Gorgo.\"\n\n\"That is just the word I was expecting from you, Mother Akka,\" returned\nthe boy eagerly.\n\n\"There are those who say that you no longer have any love in your heart\nfor the one you reared so tenderly, because he lives as eagles must\nlive. But I know now that it isn't true. And now I want to see if\nMorten Goosey-Gander is awake.\n\n\"Meanwhile, if you wish to say a 'thank you' to the one who brought me\nhere to you, I think you'll find him up there on the cliff ledge, where\nonce you found a helpless eaglet.\"\n\n\nOSA, THE GOOSE GIRL, AND LITTLE MATS\n\n\nThe year that Nils Holgersson travelled with the wild geese everybody\nwas talking about two little children, a boy and a girl, who tramped\nthrough the country. They were from Sunnerbo township, in Sm\u00c3\u00a5land, and\nhad once lived with their parents and four brothers and sisters in a\nlittle cabin on the heath.\n\nWhile the two children, Osa and Mats, were still small, a poor, homeless\nwoman came to their cabin one night and begged for shelter. Although the\nplace could hardly hold the family, she was taken in and the mother\nspread a bed for her on the floor. In the night she coughed so hard that\nthe children fancied the house shook. By morning she was too ill to\ncontinue her wanderings. The children's father and mother were as kind\nto her as could be. They gave up their bed to her and slept on the\nfloor, while the father went to the doctor and brought her medicine.\n\nThe first few days the sick woman behaved like a savage; she demanded\nconstant attention and never uttered a word of thanks. Later she became\nmore subdued and finally begged to be carried out to the heath and left\nthere to die.\n\nWhen her hosts would not hear of this, she told them that the last few\nyears she had roamed about with a band of gipsies. She herself was not\nof gipsy blood, but was the daughter of a well-to-do farmer. She had run\naway from home and gone with the nomads. She believed that a gipsy woman\nwho was angry at her had brought this sickness upon her. Nor was that\nall: The gipsy woman had also cursed her, saying that all who took her\nunder their roof or were kind to her should suffer a like fate. She\nbelieved this, and therefore begged them to cast her out of the house\nand never to see her again. She did not want to bring misfortune down\nupon such good people. But the peasants refused to do her bidding. It\nwas quite possible that they were alarmed, but they were not the kind of\nfolk who could turn out a poor, sick person.\n\nSoon after that she died, and then along came the misfortunes. Before,\nthere had never been anything but happiness in that cabin. Its inmates\nwere poor, yet not so very poor. The father was a maker of weavers'\ncombs, and mother and children helped him with the work. Father made the\nframes, mother and the older children did the binding, while the smaller\nones planed the teeth and cut them out. They worked from morning until\nnight, but the time passed pleasantly, especially when father talked of\nthe days when he travelled about in foreign lands and sold weavers'\ncombs. Father was so jolly that sometimes mother and the children would\nlaugh until their sides ached at his funny quips and jokes.\n\nThe weeks following the death of the poor vagabond woman lingered in the\nminds of the children like a horrible nightmare. They knew not if the\ntime had been long or short, but they remembered that they were always\nhaving funerals at home. One after another they lost their brothers and\nsisters. At last it was very still and sad in the cabin.\n\nThe mother kept up some measure of courage, but the father was not a bit\nlike himself. He could no longer work nor jest, but sat from morning\ntill night, his head buried in his hands, and only brooded.\n\nOnce--that was after the third burial--the father had broken out into\nwild talk, which frightened the children. He said that he could not\nunderstand why such misfortunes should come upon them. They had done a\nkindly thing in helping the sick woman. Could it be true, then, that the\nevil in this world was more powerful than the good?\n\nThe mother tried to reason with him, but she was unable to soothe him.\n\nA few days later the eldest was stricken. She had always been the\nfather's favourite, so when he realized that she, too, must go, he fled\nfrom all the misery. The mother never said anything, but she thought it\nwas best for him to be away, as she feared that he might lose his\nreason. He had brooded too long over this one idea: that God had allowed\na wicked person to bring about so much evil.\n\nAfter the father went away they became very poor. For awhile he sent\nthem money, but afterward things must have gone badly with him, for no\nmore came.\n\nThe day of the eldest daughter's burial the mother closed the cabin and\nleft home with the two remaining children, Osa and Mats. She went down\nto Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne to work in the beet fields, and found a place at the Jordberga\nsugar refinery. She was a good worker and had a cheerful and generous\nnature. Everybody liked her. Many were astonished because she could be\nso calm after all that she had passed through, but the mother was very\nstrong and patient. When any one spoke to her of her two sturdy\nchildren, she only said: \"I shall soon lose them also,\" without a quaver\nin her voice or a tear in her eye. She had accustomed herself to expect\nnothing else.\n\nBut it did not turn out as she feared. Instead, the sickness came upon\nherself. She had gone to Skane in the beginning of summer; before autumn\nshe was gone, and the children were left alone.\n\nWhile their mother was ill she had often said to the children they must\nremember that she never regretted having let the sick woman stop with\nthem. It was not hard to die when one had done right, she said, for then\none could go with a clear conscience.\n\nBefore the mother passed away, she tried to make some provision for her\nchildren. She asked the people with whom she lived to let them remain in\nthe room which she had occupied. If the children only had a shelter they\nwould not become a burden to any one. She knew that they could take care\nof themselves.\n\nOsa and Mats were allowed to keep the room on condition that they would\ntend the geese, as it was always hard to find children willing to do\nthat work. It turned out as the mother expected: they did maintain\nthemselves. The girl made candy, and the boy carved wooden toys, which\nthey sold at the farm houses. They had a talent for trading and soon\nbegan buying eggs and butter from the farmers, which they sold to the\nworkers at the sugar refinery. Osa was the older, and, by the time she\nwas thirteen, she was as responsible as a grown woman. She was quiet and\nserious, while Mats was lively and talkative. His sister used to say to\nhim that he could outcackle the geese.\n\nWhen the children had been at Jordberga for two years, there was a\nlecture given one evening at the schoolhouse. Evidently it was meant for\ngrown-ups, but the two Sm\u00c3\u00a5land children were in the audience. They did\nnot regard themselves as children, and few persons thought of them as\nsuch. The lecturer talked about the dread disease called the White\nPlague, which every year carried off so many people in Sweden. He spoke\nvery plainly and the children understood every word.\n\nAfter the lecture they waited outside the schoolhouse. When the lecturer\ncame out they took hold of hands and walked gravely up to him, asking if\nthey might speak to him.\n\nThe stranger must have wondered at the two rosy, baby-faced children\nstanding there talking with an earnestness more in keeping with people\nthrice their age; but he listened graciously to them. They related what\nhad happened in their home, and asked the lecturer if he thought their\nmother and their sisters and brothers had died of the sickness he had\ndescribed.\n\n\"Very likely,\" he answered. \"It could hardly have been any other\ndisease.\"\n\nIf only the mother and father had known what the children learned that\nevening, they might have protected themselves. If they had burned the\nclothing of the vagabond woman; if they had scoured and aired the cabin\nand had not used the old bedding, all whom the children mourned might\nhave been living yet. The lecturer said he could not say positively, but\nhe believed that none of their dear ones would have been sick had they\nunderstood how to guard against the infection.\n\nOsa and Mats waited awhile before putting the next question, for that\nwas the most important of all. It was not true then that the gipsy woman\nhad sent the sickness because they had befriended the one with whom she\nwas angry. It was not something special that had stricken only them. The\nlecturer assured them that no person had the power to bring sickness\nupon another in that way.\n\nThereupon the children thanked him and went to their room. They talked\nuntil late that night.\n\nThe next day they gave notice that they could not tend geese another\nyear, but must go elsewhere. Where were they going? Why, to try to find\ntheir father. They must tell him that their mother and the other\nchildren had died of a common ailment and not something special brought\nupon them by an angry person. They were very glad that they had found\nout about this. Now it was their duty to tell their father of it, for\nprobably he was still trying to solve the mystery.\n\nOsa and Mats set out for their old home on the heath. When they arrived\nthey were shocked to find the little cabin in flames. They went to the\nparsonage and there they learned that a railroad workman had seen their\nfather at Malmberget, far up in Lapland. He had been working in a mine\nand possibly was still there. When the clergyman heard that the children\nwanted to go in search of their father he brought forth a map and showed\nthem how far it was to Malmberget and tried to dissuade them from making\nthe journey, but the children insisted that they must find their father.\nHe had left home believing something that was not true. They must find\nhim and tell him that it was all a mistake.\n\nThey did not want to spend their little savings buying railway tickets,\ntherefore they decided to go all the way on foot, which they never\nregretted, as it proved to be a remarkably beautiful journey.\n\nBefore they were out of Sm\u00c3\u00a5land, they stopped at a farm house to buy\nfood. The housewife was a kind, motherly soul who took an interest in\nthe children. She asked them who they were and where they came from, and\nthey told her their story. \"Dear, dear! Dear, dear!\" she interpolated\ntime and again when they were speaking. Later she petted the children\nand stuffed them with all kinds of goodies, for which she would not\naccept a penny. When they rose to thank her and go, the woman asked them\nto stop at her brother's farm in the next township. Of course the\nchildren were delighted.\n\n\"Give him my greetings and tell him what has happened to you,\" said the\npeasant woman.\n\nThis the children did and were well treated. From every farm after that\nit was always: \"If you happen to go in such and such a direction, stop\nthere or there and tell them what has happened to you.\"\n\nIn every farm house to which they were sent there was always a\nconsumptive. So Osa and Mats went through the country unconsciously\nteaching the people how to combat that dreadful disease.\n\nLong, long ago, when the black plague was ravaging the country, 'twas\nsaid that a boy and a girl were seen wandering from house to house. The\nboy carried a rake, and if he stopped and raked in front of a house, it\nmeant that there many should die, but not all; for the rake has coarse\nteeth and does not take everything with it. The girl carried a broom,\nand if she came along and swept before a door, it meant that all who\nlived within must die; for the broom is an implement that makes a clean\nsweep.\n\nIt seems quite remarkable that in our time two children should wander\nthrough the land because of a cruel sickness. But these children did not\nfrighten people with the rake and the broom. They said rather: \"We will\nnot content ourselves with merely raking the yard and sweeping the\nfloors, we will use mop and brush, water and soap. We will keep clean\ninside and outside of the door and we ourselves will be clean in both\nmind and body. In this way we will conquer the sickness.\"\n\nOne day, while still in Lapland, Akka took the boy to Malmberget, where\nthey discovered little Mats lying unconscious at the mouth of the pit.\nHe and Osa had arrived there a short time before. That morning he had\nbeen roaming about, hoping to come across his father. He had ventured\ntoo near the shaft and been hurt by flying rocks after the setting off\nof a blast.\n\nThumbietot ran to the edge of the shaft and called down to the miners\nthat a little boy was injured.\n\nImmediately a number of labourers came rushing up to little Mats. Two of\nthem carried him to the hut where he and Osa were staying. They did all\nthey could to save him, but it was too late.\n\nThumbietot felt so sorry for poor Osa. He wanted to help and comfort\nher; but he knew that if he were to go to her now, he would only\nfrighten her--such as he was!\n\nThe night after the burial of little Mats, Osa straightway shut herself\nin her hut.\n\nShe sat alone recalling, one after another, things her brother had said\nand done. There was so much to think about that she did not go straight\nto bed, but sat up most of the night. The more she thought of her\nbrother the more she realized how hard it would be to live without him.\nAt last she dropped her head on the table and wept.\n\n\"What shall I do now that little Mats is gone?\" she sobbed.\n\nIt was far along toward morning and Osa, spent by the strain of her hard\nday, finally fell asleep.\n\nShe dreamed that little Mats softly opened the door and stepped into the\nroom.\n\n\"Osa, you must go and find father,\" he said.\n\n\"How can I when I don't even know where he is?\" she replied in her\ndream.\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" returned little Mats in his usual, cheery way.\n\"I'll send some one to help you.\"\n\nJust as Osa, the goose girl, dreamed that little Mats had said this,\nthere was a knock at the door. It was a real knock--not something she\nheard in the dream, but she was so held by the dream that she could not\ntell the real from the unreal. As she went on to open the door, she\nthought:\n\n\"This must be the person little Mats promised to send me.\"\n\nShe was right, for it was Thumbietot come to talk to her about her\nfather.\n\nWhen he saw that she was not afraid of him, he told her in a few words\nwhere her father was and how to reach him.\n\nWhile he was speaking, Osa, the goose girl, gradually regained\nconsciousness; when he had finished she was wide awake.\n\nThen she was so terrified at the thought of talking with an elf that she\ncould not say thank you or anything else, but quickly shut the door.\n\nAs she did that she thought she saw an expression of pain flash across\nthe elf's face, but she could not help what she did, for she was beside\nherself with fright. She crept into bed as quickly as she could and drew\nthe covers over her head.\n\nAlthough she was afraid of the elf, she had a feeling that he meant well\nby her. So the next day she made haste to do as he had told her.\n\n\nWITH THE LAPLANDERS\n\n\nOne afternoon in July it rained frightfully up around Lake Luossajaure.\nThe Laplanders, who lived mostly in the open during the summer, had\ncrawled under the tent and were squatting round the fire drinking\ncoffee.\n\nThe new settlers on the east shore of the lake worked diligently to have\ntheir homes in readiness before the severe Arctic winter set in. They\nwondered at the Laplanders, who had lived in the far north for centuries\nwithout even thinking that better protection was needed against cold and\nstorm than thin tent covering.\n\nThe Laplanders, on the other hand, wondered at the new settlers giving\nthemselves so much needless, hard work, when nothing more was necessary\nto live comfortably than a few reindeer and a tent.\n\nThey only had to drive the poles into the ground and spread the covers\nover them, and their abodes were ready. They did not have to trouble\nthemselves about decorating or furnishing. The principal thing was to\nscatter some spruce twigs on the floor, spread a few skins, and hang the\nbig kettle, in which they cooked their reindeer meat, on a chain\nsuspended from the top of the tent poles.\n\nWhile the Laplanders were chatting over their coffee cups, a row boat\ncoming from the Kiruna side pulled ashore at the Lapps' quarters.\n\nA workman and a young girl, between thirteen and fourteen, stepped from\nthe boat. The girl was Osa. The Lapp dogs bounded down to them, barking\nloudly, and a native poked his head out of the tent opening to see what\nwas going on.\n\nHe was glad when he saw the workman, for he was a friend of the\nLaplanders--a kindly and sociable man, who could speak their native\ntongue. The Lapp called to him to crawl under the tent.\n\n\"You're just in time, S\u00c3\u00b6derberg!\" he said. \"The coffee pot is on the\nfire. No one can do any work in this rain, so come in and tell us the\nnews.\"\n\nThe workman went in, and, with much ado and amid a great deal of\nlaughter and joking, places were made for S\u00c3\u00b6derberg and Osa, though the\ntent was already crowded to the limit with natives. Osa understood none\nof the conversation. She sat dumb and looked in wonderment at the kettle\nand coffee pot; at the fire and smoke; at the Lapp men and Lapp women;\nat the children and dogs; the walls and floor; the coffee cups and\ntobacco pipes; the multi-coloured costumes and crude implements. All\nthis was new to her.\n\nSuddenly she lowered her glance, conscious that every one in the tent\nwas looking at her. S\u00c3\u00b6derberg must have said something about her, for\nnow both Lapp men and Lapp women took the short pipes from their mouths\nand stared at her in open-eyed wonder and awe. The Laplander at her side\npatted her shoulder and nodded, saying in Swedish, \"bra, bra!\" (good,\ngood!) A Lapp woman filled a cup to the brim with coffee and passed it\nunder difficulties, while a Lapp boy, who was about her own age,\nwriggled and crawled between the squatters over to her.\n\nOsa felt that S\u00c3\u00b6derberg was telling the Laplanders that she had just\nburied her little brother, Mats. She wished he would find out about her\nfather instead.\n\nThe elf had said that he lived with the Lapps, who camped west of Lake\nLuossajaure, and she had begged leave to ride up on a sand truck to seek\nhim, as no regular passenger trains came so far. Both labourers and\nforemen had assisted her as best they could. An engineer had sent\nS\u00c3\u00b6derberg across the lake with her, as he spoke Lappish. She had hoped\nto meet her father as soon as she arrived. Her glance wandered anxiously\nfrom face to face, but she saw only natives. Her father was not there.\n\nShe noticed that the Lapps and the Swede, S\u00c3\u00b6derberg, grew more and more\nearnest as they talked among themselves. The Lapps shook their heads and\ntapped their foreheads, as if they were speaking of some one that was\nnot quite right in his mind.\n\nShe became so uneasy that she could no longer endure the suspense and\nasked S\u00c3\u00b6derberg what the Laplanders knew of her father.\n\n\"They say he has gone fishing,\" said the workman. \"They're not sure that\nhe can get back to the camp to-night; but as soon as the weather clears,\none of them will go in search of him.\"\n\nThereupon he turned to the Lapps and went on talking to them. He did not\nwish to give Osa an opportunity to question him further about Jon\nEsserson.\n\nTHE NEXT MORNING\n\nOla Serka himself, who was the most distinguished man among the Lapps,\nhad said that he would find Osa's father, but he appeared to be in no\nhaste and sat huddled outside the tent, thinking of Jon Esserson and\nwondering how best to tell him of his daughter's arrival. It would\nrequire diplomacy in order that Jon Esserson might not become alarmed\nand flee. He was an odd sort of man who was afraid of children. He used\nto say that the sight of them made him so melancholy that he could not\nendure it.\n\nWhile Ola Serka deliberated, Osa, the goose girl, and Aslak, the young\nLapp boy who had stared so hard at her the night before, sat on the\nground in front of the tent and chatted.\n\nAslak had been to school and could speak Swedish. He was telling Osa\nabout the life of the \"Sam\u00c3\u00a9folk,\" assuring her that they fared better\nthan other people.\n\nOsa thought that they lived wretchedly, and told him so.\n\n\"You don't know what you are talking about!\" said Aslak curtly. \"Only\nstop with us a week and you shall see that we are the happiest people on\nearth.\"\n\n\"If I were to stop here a whole week, I should be choked by all the\nsmoke in the tent,\" Osa retorted.\n\n\"Don't say that!\" protested the boy. \"You know nothing of us. Let me\ntell you something which will make you understand that the longer you\nstay with us the more contented you will become.\"\n\nThereupon Aslak began to tell Osa how a sickness called \"The Black\nPlague\" once raged throughout the land. He was not certain as to whether\nit had swept through the real \"Sam\u00c3\u00a9land,\" where they now were, but in\nJ\u00c3\u00a4mtland it had raged so brutally that among the Sam\u00c3\u00a9folk, who lived in\nthe forests and mountains there, all had died except a boy of fifteen.\nAmong the Swedes, who lived in the valleys, none was left but a girl,\nwho was also fifteen years old.\n\nThe boy and girl separately tramped the desolate country all winter in\nsearch of other human beings. Finally, toward spring, the two met.\nAslak continued: \"The Swedish girl begged the Lapp boy to accompany her\nsouthward, where she could meet people of her own race. She did not wish\nto tarry longer in J\u00c3\u00a4mtland, where there were only vacant homesteads.\nI'll take you wherever you wish to go,' said the boy, 'but not before\nwinter. It's spring now, and my reindeer go westward toward the\nmountains. You know that we who are of the Sam\u00c3\u00a9folk must go where our\nreindeer take us.' The Swedish girl was the daughter of wealthy parents.\nShe was used to living under a roof, sleeping in a bed, and eating at a\ntable. She had always despised the poor mountaineers and thought that\nthose who lived under the open sky were most unfortunate; but she was\nafraid to return to her home, where there were none but the dead. 'At\nleast let me go with you to the mountains,' she said to the boy, 'so\nthat I sha'n't have to tramp about here all alone and never hear the\nsound of a human voice.'\n\n\"The boy willingly assented, so the girl went with the reindeer to the\nmountains.\n\n\"The herd yearned for the good pastures there, and every day tramped\nlong distances to feed on the moss. There was not time to pitch tents.\nThe children had to lie on the snowy ground and sleep when the reindeer\nstopped to graze. The girl often sighed and complained of being so tired\nthat she must turn back to the valley. Nevertheless she went along to\navoid being left without human companionship.\n\n\"When they reached the highlands the boy pitched a tent for the girl on\na pretty hill that sloped toward a mountain brook.\n\n\"In the evening he lassoed and milked the reindeer, and gave the girl\nmilk to drink. He brought forth dried reindeer meat and reindeer cheese,\nwhich his people had stowed away on the heights when they were there the\nsummer before.\n\n\"Still the girl grumbled all the while, and was never satisfied. She\nwould eat neither reindeer meat nor reindeer cheese, nor would she drink\nreindeer milk. She could not accustom herself to squatting in the tent\nor to lying on the ground with only a reindeer skin and some spruce\ntwigs for a bed.\n\n\"The son of the mountains laughed at her woes and continued to treat her\nkindly.\n\n\"After a few days, the girl went up to the boy when he was milking and\nasked if she might help him. She next undertook to make the fire under\nthe kettle, in which the reindeer meat was to be cooked, then to carry\nwater and to make cheese. So the time passed pleasantly. The weather was\nmild and food was easily procured. Together they set snares for game,\nfished for salmon-trout in the rapids and picked cloud-berries in the\nswamp.\n\n\"When the summer was gone, they moved farther down the mountains, where\npine and leaf forests meet. There they pitched their tent. They had to\nwork hard every day, but fared better, for food was even more plentiful\nthan in the summer because of the game.\n\n\"When the snow came and the lakes began to freeze, they drew farther\neast toward the dense pine forests.\n\n\"As soon as the tent was up, the winter's work began. The boy taught the\ngirl to make twine from reindeer sinews, to treat skins, to make shoes\nand clothing of hides, to make combs and tools of reindeer horn, to\ntravel on skis, and to drive a sledge drawn by reindeer.\n\n\"When they had lived through the dark winter and the sun began to shine\nall day and most of the night, the boy said to the girl that now he\nwould accompany her southward, so that she might meet some of her own\nrace.\n\n\"Then the girl looked at him astonished.\n\n\"'Why do you want to send me away?' she asked. 'Do you long to be alone\nwith your reindeer?'\n\n\"'I thought that you were the one that longed to get away?' said the\nboy.\n\n\"'I have lived the life of the Sam\u00c3\u00a9folk almost a year now,' replied the\ngirl. I can't return to my people and live the shut-in life after having\nwandered freely on mountains and in forests. Don't drive me away, but\nlet me stay here. Your way of living is better than ours.'\n\n\"The girl stayed with the boy for the rest of her life, and never again\ndid she long for the valleys. And you, Osa, if you were to stay with us\nonly a month, you could never again part from us.\"\n\nWith these words, Aslak, the Lapp boy, finished his story. Just then his\nfather, Ola Serka, took the pipe from his mouth and rose.\n\nOld Ola understood more Swedish than he was willing to have any one\nknow, and he had overheard his son's remarks. While he was listening, it\nhad suddenly flashed on him how he should handle this delicate matter of\ntelling Jon Esserson that his daughter had come in search of him.\n\nOla Serka went down to Lake Luossajaure and had walked a short distance\nalong the strand, when he happened upon a man who sat on a rock fishing.\n\nThe fisherman was gray-haired and bent. His eyes blinked wearily and\nthere was something slack and helpless about him. He looked like a man\nwho had tried to carry a burden too heavy for him, or to solve a problem\ntoo difficult for him, who had become broken and despondent over his\nfailure.\n\n\"You must have had luck with your fishing, Jon, since you've been at it\nall night?\" said the mountaineer in Lappish, as he approached.\n\nThe fisherman gave a start, then glanced up. The bait on his hook was\ngone and not a fish lay on the strand beside him. He hastened to rebait\nthe hook and throw out the line. In the meantime the mountaineer\nsquatted on the grass beside him.\n\n\"There's a matter that I wanted to talk over with you,\" said Ola. \"You\nknow that I had a little daughter who died last winter, and we have\nalways missed her in the tent.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said the fisherman abruptly, a cloud passing over his\nface--as though he disliked being reminded of a dead child.\n\n\"It's not worth while to spend one's life grieving,\" said the Laplander.\n\n\"I suppose it isn't.\"\n\n\"Now I'm thinking of adopting another child. Don't you think it would be\na good idea?\"\n\n\"That depends on the child, Ola.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what I know of the girl,\" said Ola. Then he told the\nfisherman that around midsummer-time, two strange children--a boy and a\ngirl--had come to the mines to look for their father, but as their\nfather was away, they had stayed to await his return. While there, the\nboy had been killed by a blast of rock.\n\nThereupon Ola gave a beautiful description of how brave the little girl\nhad been, and of how she had won the admiration and sympathy of\neveryone.\n\n\"Is that the girl you want to take into your tent?\" asked the\nfisherman.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned the Lapp. \"When we heard her story we were all deeply\ntouched and said among ourselves that so good a sister would also make a\ngood daughter, and we hoped that she would come to us.\"\n\nThe fisherman sat quietly thinking a moment. It was plain that he\ncontinued the conversation only to please his friend, the Lapp.\n\n\"I presume the girl is one of your race?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ola, \"she doesn't belong to the Sam\u00c3\u00a9folk.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she's the daughter of some new settler and is accustomed to the\nlife here?\"\n\n\"No, she's from the far south,\" replied Ola, as if this was of small\nimportance.\n\nThe fisherman grew more interested.\n\n\"Then I don't believe that you can take her,\" he said. \"It's doubtful if\nshe could stand living in a tent in winter, since she was not brought up\nthat way.\"\n\n\"She will find kind parents and kind brothers and sisters in the tent,\"\ninsisted Ola Serka. \"It's worse to be alone than to freeze.\"\n\nThe fisherman became more and more zealous to prevent the adoption. It\nseemed as if he could not bear the thought of a child of Swedish parents\nbeing taken in by Laplanders.\n\n\"You said just now that she had a father in the mine.\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" said the Lapp abruptly.\n\n\"I suppose you have thoroughly investigated this matter, Ola?\"\n\n\"What's the use of going to all that trouble?\" disdained the Lapp. \"I\nought to know! Would the girl and her brother have been obliged to roam\nabout the country if they had a father living? Would two children have\nbeen forced to care for themselves if they had a father? The girl\nherself thinks he's alive, but I say that he must be dead.\"\n\nThe man with the tired eyes turned to Ola.\n\n\"What is the girl's name, Ola?\" he asked.\n\nThe mountaineer thought awhile, then said:\n\n\"I can't remember it. I must ask her.\"\n\n\"Ask her! Is she already here?\"\n\n\"She's down at the camp.\"\n\n\"What, Ola! Have you taken her in before knowing her father's wishes?\"\n\n\"What do I care for her father! If he isn't dead, he's probably the kind\nof man who cares nothing for his child. He may be glad to have another\ntake her in hand.\"\n\nThe fisherman threw down his rod and rose with an alertness in his\nmovements that bespoke new life.\n\n\"I don't think her father can be like other folk,\" continued the\nmountaineer. \"I dare say he is a man who is haunted by gloomy\nforebodings and therefore can not work steadily. What kind of a father\nwould that be for the girl?\"\n\nWhile Ola was talking the fisherman started up the strand.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" queried the Lapp.\n\n\"I'm going to have a look at your foster-daughter, Ola.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the Lapp. \"Come along and meet her. I think you'll say\nthat she will be a good daughter to me.\"\n\nThe Swede rushed on so rapidly that the Laplander could hardly keep pace\nwith him.\n\nAfter a moment Ola said to his companion:\n\n\"Now I recall that her name is Osa--this girl I'm adopting.\"\n\nThe other man only kept hurrying along and old Ola Serka was so well\npleased that he wanted to laugh aloud.\n\nWhen they came in sight of the tents, Ola said a few words more.\n\n\"She came here to us Sam\u00c3\u00a9folk to find her father and not to become my\nfoster-child. But if she doesn't find him, I shall be glad to keep her\nin my tent.\"\n\nThe fisherman hastened all the faster.\n\n\"I might have known that he would be alarmed when I threatened to take\nhis daughter into the Lapps' quarters,\" laughed Ola to himself.\n\nWhen the man from Kiruna, who had brought Osa to the tent, turned back\nlater in the day, he had two people with him in the boat, who sat close\ntogether, holding hands--as if they never again wanted to part.\n\nThey were Jon Esserson and his daughter. Both were unlike what they had\nbeen a few hours earlier.\n\nThe father looked less bent and weary and his eyes were clear and good,\nas if at last he had found the answer to that which had troubled him so\nlong.\n\nOsa, the goose girl, did not glance longingly about, for she had found\nsome one to care for her, and now she could be a child again.\n\n\nHOMEWARD BOUND!\n\n\nTHE FIRST TRAVELLING DAY\n\n_Saturday, October first_.\n\nThe boy sat on the goosey-gander's back and rode up amongst the clouds.\nSome thirty geese, in regular order, flew rapidly southward. There was a\nrustling of feathers and the many wings beat the air so noisily that one\ncould scarcely hear one's own voice. Akka from Kebnekaise flew in the\nlead; after her came Yksi and Kaksi, Kolme and Nelj\u00c3\u00a4, Viisi and Kuusi,\nMorten Goosey-Gander and Dunfin. The six goslings which had accompanied\nthe flock the autumn before had now left to look after themselves.\nInstead, the old geese were taking with them twenty-two goslings that\nhad grown up in the glen that summer. Eleven flew to the right, eleven\nto the left; and they did their best to fly at even distances, like the\nbig birds.\n\nThe poor youngsters had never before been on a long trip and at first\nthey had difficulty in keeping up with the rapid flight.\n\n\"Akka from Kebnekaise! Akka from Kebnekaise!\" they cried in plaintive\ntones.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said the leader-goose sharply.\n\n\"Our wings are tired of moving, our wings are tired of moving!\" wailed\nthe young ones.\n\n\"The longer you keep it up, the better it will go,\" answered the\nleader-goose, without slackening her speed. And she was quite right, for\nwhen the goslings had flown two hours longer, they complained no more of\nbeing tired.\n\nBut in the mountain glen they had been in the habit of eating all day\nlong, and very soon they began to feel hungry.\n\n\"Akka, Akka, Akka from Kebnekaise!\" wailed the goslings pitifully.\n\n\"What's the trouble now?\" asked the leader-goose.\n\n\"We're so hungry, we can't fly any more!\" whimpered the goslings. \"We're\nso hungry, we can't fly any more!\"\n\n\"Wild geese must learn to eat air and drink wind,\" said the\nleader-goose, and kept right on flying.\n\nIt actually seemed as if the young ones were learning to live on wind\nand air, for when they had flown a little longer, they said nothing more\nabout being hungry.\n\nThe goose flock was still in the mountain regions, and the old geese\ncalled out the names of all the peaks as they flew past, so that the\nyoungsters might learn them. When they had been calling out a while:\n\n\"This is Porsotjokko, this is S\u00c3\u00a4rjaktjokko, this is Sulitelma,\" and so\non, the goslings became impatient again.\n\n\"Akka, Akka, Akka!\" they shrieked in heart-rending tones.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" said the leader-goose.\n\n\"We haven't room in our heads for any more of those awful names!\"\nshrieked the goslings.\n\n\"The more you put into your heads the more you can get into them,\"\nretorted the leader-goose, and continued to call out the queer names.\n\nThe boy sat thinking that it was about time the wild geese betook\nthemselves southward, for so much snow had fallen that the ground was\nwhite as far as the eye could see. There was no use denying that it had\nbeen rather disagreeable in the glen toward the last. Rain and fog had\nsucceeded each other without any relief, and even if it did clear up\nonce in a while, immediately frost set in. Berries and mushrooms, upon\nwhich the boy had subsisted during the summer, were either frozen or\ndecayed. Finally he had been compelled to eat raw fish, which was\nsomething he disliked. The days had grown short and the long evenings\nand late mornings were rather tiresome for one who could not sleep the\nwhole time that the sun was away.\n\nNow, at last, the goslings' wings had grown, so that the geese could\nstart for the south. The boy was so happy that he laughed and sang as he\nrode on the goose's back. It was not only on account of the darkness and\ncold that he longed to get away from Lapland; there were other reasons\ntoo.\n\nThe first weeks of his sojourn there the boy had not been the least bit\nhomesick. He thought he had never before seen such a glorious country.\nThe only worry he had had was to keep the mosquitoes from eating him up.\n\nThe boy had seen very little of the goosey-gander, because the big,\nwhite gander thought only of his Dunfin and was unwilling to leave her\nfor a moment. On the other hand, Thumbietot had stuck to Akka and Gorgo,\nthe eagle, and the three of them had passed many happy hours together.\n\nThe two birds had taken him with them on long trips. He had stood on\nsnow-capped Mount Kebnekaise, had looked down at the glaciers and\nvisited many high cliffs seldom tramped by human feet. Akka had shown\nhim deep-hidden mountain dales and had let him peep into caves where\nmother wolves brought up their young. He had also made the acquaintance\nof the tame reindeer that grazed in herds along the shores of the\nbeautiful Torne Lake, and he had been down to the great falls and\nbrought greetings to the bears that lived thereabouts from their friends\nand relatives in Westmanland.\n\nEver since he had seen Osa, the goose girl, he longed for the day when\nhe might go home with Morten Goosey-Gander and be a normal human being\nonce more. He wanted to be himself again, so that Osa would not be\nafraid to talk to him and would not shut the door in his face.\n\nYes, indeed, he was glad that at last they were speeding southward. He\nwaved his cap and cheered when he saw the first pine forest. In the same\nmanner he greeted the first gray cabin, the first goat, the first cat,\nand the first chicken.\n\nThey were continually meeting birds of passage, flying now in greater\nflocks than in the spring.\n\n\"Where are you bound for, wild geese?\" called the passing birds. \"Where\nare you bound for?\"\n\n\"We, like yourselves, are going abroad,\" answered the geese.\n\n\"Those goslings of yours aren't ready to fly,\" screamed the others.\n\"They'll never cross the sea with those puny wings!\"\n\nLaplander and reindeer were also leaving the mountains. When the wild\ngeese sighted the reindeer, they circled down and called out:\n\n\"Thanks for your company this summer!\"\n\n\"A pleasant journey to you and a welcome back!\" returned the reindeer.\n\nBut when the bears saw the wild geese, they pointed them out to the cubs\nand growled:\n\n\"Just look at those geese; they are so afraid of a little cold they\ndon't dare to stay at home in winter.\"\n\nBut the old geese were ready with a retort and cried to their goslings:\n\n\"Look at those beasts that stay at home and sleep half the year rather\nthan go to the trouble of travelling south!\"\n\nDown in the pine forest the young grouse sat huddled together and gazed\nlongingly after the big bird flocks which, amid joy and merriment,\nproceeded southward.\n\n\"When will our turn come?\" they asked the mother grouse.\n\n\"You will have to stay at home with mamma and papa,\" she said.\n\n\nLEGENDS FROM H\u00c3\u0084RJEDALEN\n\n\n_Tuesday, October fourth_.\n\nThe boy had had three days' travel in the rain and mist and longed for\nsome sheltered nook, where he might rest awhile.\n\nAt last the geese alighted to feed and ease their wings a bit. To his\ngreat relief the boy saw an observation tower on a hill close by, and\ndragged himself to it.\n\nWhen he had climbed to the top of the tower he found a party of tourists\nthere, so he quickly crawled into a dark corner and was soon sound\nasleep.\n\nWhen the boy awoke, he began to feel uneasy because the tourists\nlingered so long in the tower telling stories. He thought they would\nnever go. Morten Goosey-Gander could not come for him while they were\nthere and he knew, of course, that the wild geese were in a hurry to\ncontinue the journey. In the middle of a story he thought he heard\nhonking and the beating of wings, as if the geese were flying away, but\nhe did not dare to venture over to the balustrade to find out if it was\nso.\n\nAt last, when the tourists were gone, and the boy could crawl from his\nhiding place, he saw no wild geese, and no Morten Goosey-Gander came to\nfetch him. He called, \"Here am I, where are you?\" as loud as he could,\nbut his travelling companions did not appear. Not for a second did he\nthink they had deserted him; but he feared that they had met with some\nmishap and was wondering what he should do to find them, when Bataki,\nthe raven, lit beside him.\n\nThe boy never dreamed that he should greet Bataki with such a glad\nwelcome as he now gave him.\n\n\"Dear Bataki,\" he burst forth. \"How fortunate that you are here! Maybe\nyou know what has become of Morten Goosey-Gander and the wild geese?\"\n\n\"I've just come with a greeting from them,\" replied the raven. \"Akka saw\na hunter prowling about on the mountain and therefore dared not stay to\nwait for you, but has gone on ahead. Get up on my back and you shall\nsoon be with your friends.\"\n\nThe boy quickly seated himself on the raven's back and Bataki would soon\nhave caught up with the geese had he not been hindered by a fog. It was\nas if the morning sun had awakened it to life. Little light veils of\nmist rose suddenly from the lake, from fields, and from the forest. They\nthickened and spread with marvellous rapidity, and soon the entire\nground was hidden from sight by white, rolling mists.\n\nBataki flew along above the fog in clear air and sparkling sunshine, but\nthe wild geese must have circled down among the damp clouds, for it was\nimpossible to sight them. The boy and the raven called and shrieked, but\ngot no response.\n\n\"Well, this is a stroke of ill luck!\" said Bataki finally. \"But we know\nthat they are travelling toward the south, and of course I'll find them\nas soon as the mist clears.\"\n\nThe boy was distressed at the thought of being parted from Morten\nGoosey-Gander just now, when the geese were on the wing, and the big\nwhite one might meet with all sorts of mishaps. After Thumbietot had\nbeen sitting worrying for two hours or more, he remarked to himself\nthat, thus far, there had been no mishap, and it was not worth while to\nlose heart.\n\nJust then he heard a rooster crowing down on the ground, and instantly\nhe bent forward on the raven's back and called out:\n\n\"What's the name of the country I'm travelling over?\"\n\n\"It's called H\u00c3\u00a4rjedalen, H\u00c3\u00a4rjedalen, H\u00c3\u00a4rjedalen,\" crowed the rooster.\n\n\"How does it look down there where you are?\" the boy asked.\n\n\"Cliffs in the west, woods in the east, broad valleys across the whole\ncountry,\" replied the rooster.\n\n\"Thank you,\" cried the boy. \"You give a clear account of it.\"\n\nWhen they had travelled a little farther, he heard a crow cawing down in\nthe mist.\n\n\"What kind of people live in this country?\" shouted the boy.\n\n\"Good, thrifty peasants,\" answered the crow. \"Good, thrifty peasants.\"\n\n\"What do they do?\" asked the boy. \"What do they do?\"\n\n\"They raise cattle and fell forests,\" cawed the crow.\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied the boy. \"You answer well.\"\n\nA bit farther on he heard a human voice yodeling and singing down in the\nmist.\n\n\"Is there any large city in this part of the country?\" the boy asked.\n\n\"What--what--who is it that calls?\" cried the human voice.\n\n\"Is there any large city in this region?\" the boy repeated.\n\n\"I want to know who it is that calls,\" shouted the human voice.\n\n\"I might have known that I could get no information when I asked a human\nbeing a civil question,\" the boy retorted.\n\nIt was not long before the mist went away as suddenly as it had come.\nThen the boy saw a beautiful landscape, with high cliffs as in J\u00c3\u00a4mtland,\nbut there were no large, flourishing settlements on the mountain slopes.\nThe villages lay far apart, and the farms were small. Bataki followed\nthe stream southward till they came within sight of a village. There he\nalighted in a stubble field and let the boy dismount.\n\n\"In the summer grain grew on this ground,\" said Bataki. \"Look around and\nsee if you can't find something eatable.\"\n\nThe boy acted upon the suggestion and before long he found a blade of\nwheat. As he picked out the grains and ate them, Bataki talked to him.\n\n\"Do you see that mountain towering directly south of us?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, of course, I see it,\" said the boy.\n\n\"It is called Sonfj\u00c3\u00a4llet,\" continued the raven; \"you can imagine that\nwolves were plentiful there once upon a time.\"\n\n\"It must have been an ideal place for wolves,\" said the boy.\n\n\"The people who lived here in the valley were frequently attacked by\nthem,\" remarked the raven.\n\n\"Perhaps you remember a good wolf story you could tell me?\" said the\nboy.\n\n\"I've been told that a long, long time ago the wolves from Sonfj\u00c3\u00a4llet\nare supposed to have waylaid a man who had gone out to peddle his\nwares,\" began Bataki. \"He was from Hede, a village a few miles down the\nvalley. It was winter time and the wolves made for him as he was driving\nover the ice on Lake Ljusna. There were about nine or ten, and the man\nfrom Hede had a poor old horse, so there was very little hope of his\nescaping.\n\n\"When the man heard the wolves howl and saw how many there were after\nhim, he lost his head, and it did not occur to him that he ought to dump\nhis casks and jugs out of the sledge, to lighten the load. He only\nwhipped up the horse and made the best speed he could, but he soon\nobserved that the wolves were gaining on him. The shores were desolate\nand he was fourteen miles from the nearest farm. He thought that his\nfinal hour had come, and was paralyzed with fear.\n\n\"While he sat there, terrified, he saw something move in the brush,\nwhich had been set in the ice to mark out the road; and when he\ndiscovered who it was that walked there, his fear grew more and more\nintense.\n\n\"Wild beasts were not coming toward him, but a poor old woman, named\nFinn-Malin, who was in the habit of roaming about on highways and\nbyways. She was a hunchback, and slightly lame, so he recognized her at\na distance.\n\n\"The old woman was walking straight toward the wolves. The sledge had\nhidden them from her view, and the man comprehended at once that, if he\nwere to drive on without warning her, she would walk right into the jaws\nof the wild beasts, and while they were rending her, he would have time\nenough to get away.\n\n\"The old woman walked slowly, bent over a cane. It was plain that she\nwas doomed if he did not help her, but even if he were to stop and take\nher into the sledge, it was by no means certain that she would be safe.\nMore than likely the wolves would catch up with them, and he and she and\nthe horse would all be killed. He wondered if it were not better to\nsacrifice one life in order that two might be spared--this flashed upon\nhim the minute he saw the old woman. He had also time to think how it\nwould be with him afterward--if perchance he might not regret that he\nhad not succoured her; or if people should some day learn of the meeting\nand that he had not tried to help her. It was a terrible temptation.\n\n\"'I would rather not have seen her,' he said to himself.\n\n\"Just then the wolves howled savagely. The horse reared, plunged\nforward, and dashed past the old beggar woman. She, too, had heard the\nhowling of the wolves, and, as the man from Hede drove by, he saw that\nthe old woman knew what awaited her. She stood motionless, her mouth\nopen for a cry, her arms stretched out for help. But she neither cried\nnor tried to throw herself into the sledge. Something seemed to have\nturned her to stone. 'It was I,' thought the man. 'I must have looked\nlike a demon as I passed.'\n\n\"He tried to feel satisfied, now that he was certain of escape; but at\nthat very moment his heart reproached him. Never before had he done a\ndastardly thing, and he felt now that his whole life was blasted.\n\n\"'Let come what may,' he said, and reined in the horse, 'I cannot leave\nher alone with the wolves!'\n\n\"It was with great difficulty that he got the horse to turn, but in the\nend he managed it and promptly drove back to her.\n\n\"'Be quick and get into the sledge,' he said gruffly; for he was mad\nwith himself for not leaving the old woman to her fate.\n\n\"'You might stay at home once in awhile, you old hag!' he growled. 'Now\nboth my horse and I will come to grief on your account.'\n\n\"The old woman did not say a word, but the man from Hede was in no mood\nto spare her.\n\n\"'The horse has already tramped thirty-five miles to-day, and the load\nhasn't lightened any since you got up on it!' he grumbled, 'so that you\nmust understand he'll soon be exhausted.'\n\n\"The sledge runners crunched on the ice, but for all that he heard how\nthe wolves panted, and knew that the beasts were almost upon him.\n\n\"'It's all up with us!' he said. 'Much good it was, either to you or to\nme, this attempt to save you, Finn-Malin!'\n\n\"Up to this point the old woman had been silent--like one who is\naccustomed to take abuse--but now she said a few words.\n\n\"'I can't understand why you don't throw out your wares and lighten the\nload. You can come back again to-morrow and gather them up.'\n\n\"The man realized that this was sound advice and was surprised that he\nhad not thought of it before. He tossed the reins to the old woman,\nloosed the ropes that bound the casks, and pitched them out. The wolves\nwere right upon them, but now they stopped to examine that which was\nthrown on the ice, and the travellers again had the start of them.\n\n\"'If this does not help you,' said the old woman, 'you understand, of\ncourse, that I will give myself up to the wolves voluntarily, that you\nmay escape.'\n\n\"While she was speaking the man was trying to push a heavy brewer's vat\nfrom the long sledge. As he tugged at this he paused, as if he could not\nquite make up his mind to throw it out; but, in reality, his mind was\ntaken up with something altogether different.\n\n\"'Surely a man and a horse who have no infirmities need not let a feeble\nold woman be devoured by wolves for their sakes!' he thought. 'There\nmust be some other way of salvation. Why, of course, there is! It's only\nmy stupidity that hinders me from finding the way.'\n\n\"Again he started to push the vat, then paused once more and burst out\nlaughing.\n\n\"The old woman was alarmed and wondered if he had gone mad, but the man\nfrom Hede was laughing at himself because he had been so stupid all the\nwhile. It was the simplest thing in the world to save all three of them.\nHe could not imagine why he had not thought of it before.\n\n\"'Listen to what I say to you, Malin!' he said. 'It was splendid of you\nto be willing to throw yourself to the wolves. But you won't have to do\nthat because I know how we can all three be helped without endangering\nthe life of any. Remember, whatever I may do, you are to sit still and\ndrive down to Lins\u00c3\u00a4ll. There you must waken the townspeople and tell\nthem that I'm alone out here on the ice, surrounded by wolves, and ask\nthem to come and help me.'\n\n\"The man waited until the wolves were almost upon the sledge. Then he\nrolled out the big brewer's vat, jumped down, and crawled in under it.\n\n\"It was a huge vat, large enough to hold a whole Christmas brew. The\nwolves pounced upon it and bit at the hoops, but the vat was too heavy\nfor them to move. They could not get at the man inside.\n\n\"He knew that he was safe and laughed at the wolves. After a bit he was\nserious again.\n\n\"'For the future, when I get into a tight place, I shall remember this\nvat, and I shall bear in mind that I need never wrong either myself or\nothers, for there is always a third way out of a difficulty if only one\ncan hit upon it.'\"\n\nWith this Bataki closed his narrative.\n\nThe boy noticed that the raven never spoke unless there was some special\nmeaning back of his words, and the longer he listened to him, the more\nthoughtful he became.\n\n\"I wonder why you told me that story?\" remarked the boy.\n\n\"I just happened to think of it as I stood here, gazing up at\nSonfj\u00c3\u00a4llet,\" replied the raven.\n\nNow they had travelled farther down Lake Ljusna and in an hour or so\nthey came to Kols\u00c3\u00a4tt, close to the border of H\u00c3\u00a4lsingland. Here the raven\nalighted near a little hut that had no windows--only a shutter. From the\nchimney rose sparks and smoke, and from within the sound of heavy\nhammering was heard.\n\n\"Whenever I see this smithy,\" observed the raven, \"I'm reminded that, in\nformer times, there were such skilled blacksmiths here in H\u00c3\u00a4rjedalen,\nmore especially in this village--that they couldn't be matched in the\nwhole country.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you also remember a story about them?\" said the boy.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Bataki, \"I remember one about a smith from H\u00c3\u00a4rjedalen\nwho once invited two other master blacksmiths--one from Dalecarlia and\none from Vermland--to compete with him at nail-making. The challenge was\naccepted and the three blacksmiths met here at Kols\u00c3\u00a4tt. The Dalecarlian\nbegan. He forged a dozen nails, so even and smooth and sharp that they\ncouldn't be improved upon. After him came the Vermlander. He, too,\nforged a dozen nails, which were quite perfect and, moreover, he\nfinished them in half the time that it took the Dalecarlian. When the\njudges saw this they said to the H\u00c3\u00a4rjedal smith that it wouldn't be\nworth while for him to try, since he could not forge better than the\nDalecarlian or faster than the Vermlander.\n\n\"'I sha'n't give up! There must be still another way of excelling,'\ninsisted the H\u00c3\u00a4rjedal smith.\n\n\"He placed the iron on the anvil without heating it at the forge; he\nsimply hammered it hot and forged nail after nail, without the use of\neither anvil or bellows. None of the judges had ever seen a blacksmith\nwield a hammer more masterfully, and the H\u00c3\u00a4rjedal smith was proclaimed\nthe best in the land.\"\n\nWith these remarks Bataki subsided, and the boy grew even more\nthoughtful.\n\n\"I wonder what your purpose was in telling me that?\" he queried.\n\n\"The story dropped into my mind when I saw the old smithy again,\" said\nBataki in an offhand manner.\n\nThe two travellers rose again into the air and the raven carried the boy\nsouthward till they came to Lillh\u00c3\u00a4rdal Parish, where he alighted on a\nleafy mound at the top of a ridge.\n\n\"I wonder if you know upon what mound you are standing?\" said Bataki.\n\nThe boy had to confess that he did not know.\n\n\"This is a grave,\" said Bataki. \"Beneath this mound lies the first\nsettler in H\u00c3\u00a4rjedalen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you have a story to tell of him too?\" said the boy.\n\n\"I haven't heard much about him, but I think he was a Norwegian. He had\nserved with a Norwegian king, got into his bad graces, and had to flee\nthe country.\n\n\"Later he went over to the Swedish king, who lived at Upsala, and took\nservice with him. But, after a time, he asked for the hand of the king's\nsister in marriage, and when the king wouldn't give him such a high-born\nbride, he eloped with her. By that time he had managed to get himself\ninto such disfavour that it wasn't safe for him to live either in Norway\nor Sweden, and he did not wish to move to a foreign country. 'But there\nmust still be a course open to me,' he thought. With his servants and\ntreasures, he journeyed through Dalecarlia until he arrived in the\ndesolate forests beyond the outskirts of the province. There he settled,\nbuilt houses and broke up land. Thus, you see, he was the first man to\nsettle in this part of the country.\"\n\nAs the boy listened to the last story, he looked very serious.\n\n\"I wonder what your object is in telling me all this?\" he repeated.\n\nBataki twisted and turned and screwed up his eyes, and it was some time\nbefore he answered the boy.\n\n\"Since we are here alone,\" he said finally, \"I shall take this\nopportunity to question you regarding a certain matter.\n\n\"Have you ever tried to ascertain upon what terms the elf who\ntransformed you was to restore you to a normal human being?\"\n\n\"The only stipulation I've heard anything about was that I should take\nthe white goosey-gander up to Lapland and bring him back to Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, safe\nand sound.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Bataki; \"for when last we met, you talked\nconfidently of there being nothing more contemptible than deceiving a\nfriend who trusts one. You'd better ask Akka about the terms. You know,\nI dare say, that she was at your home and talked with the elf.\"\n\n\"Akka hasn't told me of this,\" said the boy wonderingly.\n\n\"She must have thought that it was best for you not to know just what\nthe elf _did_ say. Naturally she would rather help you than Morten\nGoosey-Gander.\"\n\n\"It is singular, Bataki, that you always have a way of making me feel\nunhappy and anxious,\" said the boy.\n\n\"I dare say it might seem so,\" continued the raven, \"but this time I\nbelieve that you will be grateful to me for telling you that the elf's\nwords were to this effect: You were to become a normal human being again\nif you would bring back Morten Goosey-Gander that your mother might lay\nhim on the block and chop his head off.\"\n\nThe boy leaped up.\n\n\"That's only one of your base fabrications,\" he cried indignantly.\n\n\"You can ask Akka yourself,\" said Bataki. \"I see her coming up there\nwith her whole flock. And don't forget what I have told you to-day.\nThere is usually a way out of all difficulties, if only one can find it.\nI shall be interested to see what success you have.\"\n\n\nVERMLAND AND DALSLAND\n\n\n_Wednesday, October fifth_.\n\nTo-day the boy took advantage of the rest hour, when Akka was feeding\napart from the other wild geese, to ask her if that which Bataki had\nrelated was true, and Akka could not deny it. The boy made the\nleader-goose promise that she would not divulge the secret to Morten\nGoosey-Gander. The big white gander was so brave and generous that he\nmight do something rash were he to learn of the elf's stipulations.\n\nLater the boy sat on the goose-back, glum and silent, and hung his head.\nHe heard the wild geese call out to the goslings that now they were in\nDalarne, they could see St\u00c3\u00a4djan in the north, and that now they were\nflying over \u00c3\u0096sterdal River to Horrmund Lake and were coming to Vesterdal\nRiver. But the boy did not care even to glance at all this.\n\n\"I shall probably travel around with wild geese the rest of my life,\" he\nremarked to himself, \"and I am likely to see more of this land than I\nwish.\"\n\nHe was quite as indifferent when the wild geese called out to him that\nnow they had arrived in Vermland and that the stream they were following\nsouthward was Klar\u00c3\u00a4lven.\n\n\"I've seen so many rivers already,\" thought the boy, \"why bother to look\nat one more?\"\n\nEven had he been more eager for sight-seeing, there was not very much to\nbe seen, for northern Vermland is nothing but vast, monotonous forest\ntracts, through which Klar\u00c3\u00a4lven winds--narrow and rich in rapids. Here\nand there one can see a charcoal kiln, a forest clearing, or a few low,\nchimneyless huts, occupied by Finns. But the forest as a whole is so\nextensive one might fancy it was far up in Lapland.\n\nA LITTLE HOMESTEAD\n\n_Thursday, October sixth_.\n\nThe wild geese followed Klar\u00c3\u00a4lven as far as the big iron foundries at\nMonk Fors. Then they proceeded westward to Fryksdalen. Before they got\nto Lake Fryken it began to grow dusky, and they lit in a little wet\nmorass on a wooded hill. The morass was certainly a good night quarter\nfor the wild geese, but the boy thought it dismal and rough, and wished\nfor a better sleeping place. While he was still high in the air, he had\nnoticed that below the ridge lay a number of farms, and with great haste\nhe proceeded to seek them out.\n\nThey were farther away than he had fancied and several times he was\ntempted to turn back. Presently the woods became less dense, and he came\nto a road skirting the edge of the forest. From it branched a pretty\nbirch-bordered lane, which led down to a farm, and immediately he\nhastened toward it.\n\nFirst the boy entered a farm yard as large as a city marketplace and\nenclosed by a long row of red houses. As he crossed the yard, he saw\nanother farm where the dwelling-house faced a gravel path and a wide\nlawn. Back of the house there was a garden thick with foliage. The\ndwelling itself was small and humble, but the garden was edged by a row\nof exceedingly tall mountain-ash trees, so close together that they\nformed a real wall around it. It appeared to the boy as if he were\ncoming into a great, high-vaulted chamber, with the lovely blue sky for\na ceiling. The mountain-ash were thick with clusters of red berries, the\ngrass plots were still green, of course, but that night there was a full\nmoon, and as the bright moonlight fell upon the grass it looked as white\nas silver.\n\nNo human being was in sight and the boy could wander freely wherever he\nwished. When he was in the garden he saw something which almost put him\nin good humour. He had climbed a mountain-ash to eat berries, but before\nhe could reach a cluster he caught sight of a barberry bush, which was\nalso full of berries. He slid along the ash branch and clambered up into\nthe barberry bush, but he was no sooner there than he discovered a\ncurrant bush, on which still hung long red clusters. Next he saw that\nthe garden was full of gooseberries and raspberries and dog-rose bushes;\nthat there were cabbages and turnips in the vegetable beds and berries\non every bush, seeds on the herbs and grain-filled ears on every blade.\nAnd there on the path--no, of course he could not mistake it--was a big\nred apple which shone in the moonlight.\n\nThe boy sat down at the side of the path, with the big red apple in\nfront of him, and began cutting little pieces from it with his sheath\nknife.\n\n\"It wouldn't be such a serious matter to be an elf all one's life if it\nwere always as easy to get good food as it is here,\" he thought.\n\nHe sat and mused as he ate, wondering finally if it would not be as well\nfor him to remain here and let the wild geese travel south without him.\n\n\"I don't know for the life of me how I can ever explain to Morten\nGoosey-Gander that I cannot go home,\" thought he. \"It would be better\nwere I to leave him altogether. I could gather provisions enough for the\nwinter, as well as the squirrels do, and if I were to live in a dark\ncorner of the stable or the cow shed, I shouldn't freeze to death.\"\n\nJust as he was thinking this, he heard a light rustle over his head,\nand a second later something which resembled a birch stump stood on the\nground beside him.\n\nThe stump twisted and turned, and two bright dots on top of it glowed\nlike coals of fire. It looked like some enchantment. However, the boy\nsoon remarked that the stump had a hooked beak and big feather wreaths\naround its glowing eyes. Then he knew that this was no enchantment.\n\n\"It is a real pleasure to meet a living creature,\" remarked the boy.\n\"Perhaps you will be good enough to tell me the name of this place, Mrs.\nBrown Owl, and what sort of folk live here.\"\n\nThat evening, as on all other evenings, the owl had perched on a rung of\nthe big ladder propped against the roof, from which she had looked down\ntoward the gravel walks and grass plots, watching for rats. Very much to\nher surprise, not a single grayskin had appeared. She saw instead\nsomething that looked like a human being, but much, much smaller, moving\nabout in the garden.\n\n\"That's the one who is scaring away the rats!\" thought the owl. \"What in\nthe world can it be? It's not a squirrel, nor a kitten, nor a weasel,\"\nshe observed. \"I suppose that a bird who has lived on an old place like\nthis as long as I have ought to know about everything in the world; but\nthis is beyond my comprehension,\" she concluded.\n\nShe had been staring at the object that moved on the gravel path until\nher eyes burned. Finally curiosity got the better of her and she flew\ndown to the ground to have a closer view of the stranger.\n\nWhen the boy began to speak, the owl bent forward and looked him up and\ndown.\n\n\"He has neither claws nor horns,\" she remarked to herself, \"yet who\nknows but he may have a poisonous fang or some even more dangerous\nweapon. I must try to find out what he passes for before I venture to\ntouch him.\"\n\n\"The place is called M\u00c3\u00a5rbacka,\" said the owl, \"and gentlefolk lived here\nonce upon a time. But you, yourself, who are you?\"\n\n\"I think of moving in here,\" volunteered the boy without answering the\nowl's question. \"Would it be possible, do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--but it's not much of a place now compared to what it was\nonce,\" said the owl. \"You can weather it here I dare say. It all depends\nupon what you expect to live on. Do you intend to take up the rat\nchase?\"\n\n\"Oh, by no means!\" declared the boy. \"There is more fear of the rats\neating me than that I shall do them any harm.\"\n\n\"It can't be that he is as harmless as he says,\" thought the brown owl.\n\"All the same I believe I'll make an attempt....\" She rose into the air,\nand in a second her claws were fastened in Nils Holgersson's shoulder\nand she was trying to hack at his eyes.\n\nThe boy shielded both eyes with one hand and tried to free himself with\nthe other, at the same time calling with all his might for help. He\nrealized that he was in deadly peril and thought that this time, surely,\nit was all over with him!\n\n\nNow I must tell you of a strange coincidence: The very year that Nils\nHolgersson travelled with the wild geese there was a woman who thought\nof writing a book about Sweden, which would be suitable for children to\nread in the schools. She had thought of this from Christmas time until\nthe following autumn; but not a line of the book had she written. At\nlast she became so tired of the whole thing that she said to herself:\n\"You are not fitted for such work. Sit down and compose stories and\nlegends, as usual, and let another write this book, which has got to be\nserious and instructive, and in which there must not be one untruthful\nword.\"\n\nIt was as good as settled that she would abandon the idea. But she\nthought, very naturally, it would have been agreeable to write something\nbeautiful about Sweden, and it was hard for her to relinquish her work.\nFinally, it occurred to her that maybe it was because she lived in a\ncity, with only gray streets and house walls around her, that she could\nmake no headway with the writing. Perhaps if she were to go into the\ncountry, where she could see woods and fields, that it might go better.\n\nShe was from Vermland, and it was perfectly clear to her that she\nwished to begin the book with that province. First of all she would\nwrite about the place where she had grown up. It was a little homestead,\nfar removed from the great world, where many old-time habits and customs\nwere retained. She thought that it would be entertaining for children to\nhear of the manifold duties which had succeeded one another the year\naround. She wanted to tell them how they celebrated Christmas and New\nYear and Easter and Midsummer Day in her home; what kind of house\nfurnishings they had; what the kitchen and larder were like, and how the\ncow shed, stable, lodge, and bath house had looked. But when she was to\nwrite about it the pen would not move. Why this was she could not in the\nleast understand; nevertheless it was so.\n\nTrue, she remembered it all just as distinctly as if she were still\nliving in the midst of it. She argued with herself that since she was\ngoing into the country anyway, perhaps she ought to make a little trip\nto the old homestead that she might see it again before writing about\nit. She had not been there in many years and did not think it half bad\nto have a reason for the journey. In fact she had always longed to be\nthere, no matter in what part of the world she happened to be. She had\nseen many places that were more pretentious and prettier. But nowhere\ncould she find such comfort and protection as in the home of her\nchildhood.\n\nIt was not such an easy matter for her to go home as one might think,\nfor the estate had been sold to people she did not know. She felt, to be\nsure, that they would receive her well, but she did not care to go to\nthe old place to sit and talk with strangers, for she wanted to recall\nhow it had been in times gone by. That was why she planned it so as to\narrive there late in the evening, when the day's work was done and the\npeople were indoors.\n\nShe had never imagined that it would be so wonderful to come home! As\nshe sat in the cart and drove toward the old homestead she fancied that\nshe was growing younger and younger every minute, and that soon she\nwould no longer be an oldish person with hair that was turning gray,\nbut a little girl in short skirts with a long flaxen braid. As she\nrecognized each farm along the road, she could not picture anything else\nthan that everything at home would be as in bygone days. Her father and\nmother and brothers and sisters would be standing on the porch to\nwelcome her; the old housekeeper would run to the kitchen window to see\nwho was coming, and Nero and Freja and another dog or two would come\nbounding and jumping up on her.\n\nThe nearer she approached the place the happier she felt. It was autumn,\nwhich meant a busy time with a round of duties. It must have been all\nthese varying duties which prevented home from ever being monotonous.\nAll along the way the farmers were digging potatoes, and probably they\nwould be doing likewise at her home. That meant that they must begin\nimmediately to grate potatoes and make potato flour. The autumn had been\na mild one; she wondered if everything in the garden had already been\nstored. The cabbages were still out, but perhaps the hops had been\npicked, and all the apples.\n\nIt would be well if they were not having house cleaning at home. Autumn\nfair time was drawing nigh, everywhere the cleaning and scouring had to\nbe done before the fair opened. That was regarded as a great event--more\nespecially by the servants. It was a pleasure to go into the kitchen on\nMarket Eve and see the newly scoured floor strewn with juniper twigs,\nthe whitewashed walls and the shining copper utensils which were\nsuspended from the ceiling.\n\nEven after the fair festivities were over there would not be much of a\nbreathing spell, for then came the work on the flax. During dog days the\nflax had been spread out on a meadow to mould. Now it was laid in the\nold bath house, where the stove was lighted to dry it out. When it was\ndry enough to handle all the women in the neighbourhood were called\ntogether. They sat outside the bath house and picked the flax to pieces.\nThen they beat it with swingles, to separate the fine white fibres from\nthe dry stems. As they worked, the women grew gray with dust; their hair\nand clothing were covered with flax seed, but they did not seem to mind\nit. All day the swingles pounded, and the chatter went on, so that when\none went near the old bath house it sounded as if a blustering storm had\nbroken loose there.\n\nAfter the work with the flax, came the big hard-tack baking, the sheep\nshearing, and the servants' moving time. In November there were busy\nslaughter days, with salting of meats, sausage making, baking of blood\npudding, and candle steeping. The seamstress who used to make up their\nhomespun dresses had to come at this time, of course, and those were\nalways two pleasant weeks--when the women folk sat together and busied\nthemselves with sewing. The cobbler, who made shoes for the entire\nhousehold, sat working at the same time in the men-servants' quarters,\nand one never tired of watching him as he cut the leather and soled and\nheeled the shoes and put eyelets in the shoestring holes.\n\nBut the greatest rush came around Christmas time. Lucia Day--when the\nhousemaid went about dressed in white, with candles in her hair, and\nserved coffee to everybody at five in the morning--came as a sort of\nreminder that for the next two weeks they could not count on much sleep.\nFor now they must brew the Christmas ale, steep the Christmas fish in\nlye, and do their Christmas baking and Christmas scouring.\n\nShe was in the middle of the baking, with pans of Christmas buns and\ncooky platters all around her, when the driver drew in the reins at the\nend of the lane as she had requested. She started like one suddenly\nawakened from a sound sleep. It was dismal for her who had just dreamed\nherself surrounded by all her people to be sitting alone in the late\nevening. As she stepped from the wagon and started to walk up the long\nlane that she might come unobserved to her old home, she felt so keenly\nthe contrast between then and now that she would have preferred to turn\nback.\n\n\"Of what use is it to come here?\" she sighed. \"It can't be the same as\nin the old days!\"\n\nOn the other hand she felt that since she had travelled such a long\ndistance, she would see the place at all events, so continued to walk\non, although she was more depressed with every step that she took.\n\nShe had heard that it was very much changed; and it certainly was! But\nshe did not observe this now in the evening. She thought, rather, that\neverything was quite the same. There was the pond, which in her youth\nhad been full of carp and where no one dared fish, because it was\nfather's wish that the carp should be left in peace. Over there were the\nmen-servants' quarters, the larder and barn, with the farm yard bell\nover one gable and the weather-vane over the other. The house yard was\nlike a circular room, with no outlook in any direction, as it had been\nin her father's time--for he had not the heart to cut down as much as a\nbush.\n\nShe lingered in the shadow under the big mountain-ash at the entrance to\nthe farm, and stood looking about her. As she stood there a strange\nthing happened; a flock of doves came and lit beside her.\n\nShe could hardly believe that they were real birds, for doves are not in\nthe habit of moving about after sundown. It must have been the beautiful\nmoonlight that had awakened these. They must have thought it was dawn\nand flown from their dove-cotes, only to become confused, hardly knowing\nwhere they were. When they saw a human being they flew over to her, as\nif she would set them right.\n\nThere had been many flocks of doves at the manor when her parents lived\nthere, for the doves were among the creatures which her father had taken\nunder his special care. If one ever mentioned the killing of a dove, it\nput him in a bad humour. She was pleased that the pretty birds had come\nto meet her in the old home. Who could tell but the doves had flown out\nin the night to show her they had not forgotten that once upon a time\nthey had a good home there.\n\nPerhaps her father had sent his birds with a greeting to her, so that\nshe would not feel so sad and lonely when she came to her former home.\n\nAs she thought of this, there welled up within her such an intense\nlonging for the old times that her eyes filled with tears. Life had\nbeen beautiful in this place. They had had weeks of work broken by many\nholiday festivities. They had toiled hard all day, but at evening they\nhad gathered around the lamp and read Tegner and Runeberg, \"_Fru\"_\nLenngren and \"_Mamsell\"_ Bremer. They had cultivated grain, but also\nroses and jasmine. They had spun flax, but had sung folk-songs as they\nspun. They had worked hard at their history and grammar, but they had\nalso played theatre and written verses. They had stood at the kitchen\nstove and prepared food, but had learned, also, to play the flute and\nguitar, the violin and piano. They had planted cabbages and turnips,\npeas and beans in one garden, but they had another full of apples and\npears and all kinds of berries. They had lived by themselves, and this\nwas why so many stories and legends were stowed away in their memories.\nThey had worn homespun clothes, but they had also been able to lead\ncare-free and independent lives.\n\n\"Nowhere else in the world do they know how to get so much out of life\nas they did at one of these little homesteads in my childhood!\" she\nthought. \"There was just enough work and just enough play, and every day\nthere was a joy. How I should love to come back here again! Now that I\nhave seen the place, it is hard to leave it.\"\n\nThen she turned to the flock of doves and said to them--laughing at\nherself all the while:\n\n\"Won't you fly to father and tell him that I long to come home? I have\nwandered long enough in strange places. Ask him if he can't arrange it\nso that I may soon turn back to my childhood's home.\"\n\nThe moment she had said this the flock of doves rose and flew away. She\ntried to follow them with her eyes, but they vanished instantly. It was\nas if the whole white company had dissolved in the shimmering air.\n\nThe doves had only just gone when she heard a couple of piercing cries\nfrom the garden, and as she hastened thither she saw a singular sight.\nThere stood a tiny midget, no taller than a hand's breadth, struggling\nwith a brown owl. At first she was so astonished that she could not\nmove. But when the midget cried more and more pitifully, she stepped up\nquickly and parted the fighters. The owl swung herself into a tree, but\nthe midget stood on the gravel path, without attempting either to hide\nor to run away.\n\n\"Thanks for your help,\" he said. \"But it was very stupid of you to let\nthe owl escape. I can't get away from here, because she is sitting up in\nthe tree watching me.\"\n\n\"It was thoughtless of me to let her go. But to make amends, can't I\naccompany you to your home?\" asked she who wrote stories, somewhat\nsurprised to think that in this unexpected fashion she had got into\nconversation with one of the tiny folk. Still she was not so much\nsurprised after all. It was as if all the while she had been awaiting\nsome extraordinary experience, while she walked in the moonlight outside\nher old home.\n\n\"The fact is, I had thought of stopping here over night,\" said the\nmidget. \"If you will only show me a safe sleeping place, I shall not be\nobliged to return to the forest before daybreak.\"\n\n\"Must I show you a place to sleep? Are you not at home here?\"\n\n\"I understand that you take me for one of the tiny folk,\" said the\nmidget, \"but I'm a human being, like yourself, although I have been\ntransformed by an elf.\"\n\n\"That is the most remarkable thing I have ever heard! Wouldn't you like\nto tell me how you happened to get into such a plight?\"\n\nThe boy did not mind telling her of his adventures, and, as the\nnarrative proceeded, she who listened to him grew more and more\nastonished and happy.\n\n\"What luck to run across one who has travelled all over Sweden on the\nback of a goose!\" thought she. \"Just this which he is relating I shall\nwrite down in my book. Now I need worry no more over that matter. It was\nwell that I came home. To think that I should find such help as soon as\nI came to the old place!\"\n\nInstantly another thought flashed into her mind. She had sent word to\nher father by the doves that she longed for home, and almost immediately\nshe had received help in the matter she had pondered so long. Might not\nthis be the father's answer to her prayer?\n\n\nTHE TREASURE ON THE ISLAND\n\n\nON THEIR WAY TO THE SEA\n\n_Friday, October seventh_.\n\nFrom the very start of the autumn trip the wild geese had flown straight\nsouth; but when they left Fryksdalen they veered in another direction,\ntravelling over western Vermland and Dalsland, toward Bohusl\u00c3\u00a4n.\n\nThat was a jolly trip! The goslings were now so used to flying that they\ncomplained no more of fatigue, and the boy was fast recovering his good\nhumour. He was glad that he had talked with a human being. He felt\nencouraged when she said to him that if he were to continue doing good\nto all whom he met, as heretofore, it could not end badly for him. She\nwas not able to tell him how to get back his natural form, but she had\ngiven him a little hope and assurance, which inspired the boy to think\nout a way to prevent the big white gander from going home.\n\n\"Do you know, Morten Goosey-Gander, that it will be rather monotonous\nfor us to stay at home all winter after having been on a trip like\nthis,\" he said, as they were flying far up in the air. \"I'm sitting here\nthinking that we ought to go abroad with the geese.\"\n\n\"Surely you are not in earnest!\" said the goosey-gander. Since he had\nproved to the wild geese his ability to travel with them all the way to\nLapland, he was perfectly satisfied to get back to the goose pen in\nHolger Nilsson's cow shed.\n\nThe boy sat silently a while and gazed down on Vermland, where the birch\nwoods, leafy groves, and gardens were clad in red and yellow autumn\ncolours.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen the earth beneath us as lovely as it is\nto-day!\" he finally remarked. \"The lakes are like blue satin bands.\nDon't you think it would be a pity to settle down in West Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g and\nnever see any more of the world?\"\n\n\"I thought you wanted to go home to your mother and father and show them\nwhat a splendid boy you had become?\" said the goosey-gander.\n\nAll summer he had been dreaming of what a proud moment it would be for\nhim when he should alight in the house yard before Holger Nilsson's\ncabin and show Dunfin and the six goslings to the geese and chickens,\nthe cows and the cat, and to Mother Holger Nilsson herself, so that he\nwas not very happy over the boy's proposal.\n\n\"Now, Morten Goosey-Gander, don't you think yourself that it would be\nhard never to see anything more that is beautiful!\" said the boy.\n\n\"I would rather see the fat grain fields of S\u00c3\u00b6dersl\u00c3\u00a4tt than these lean\nhills,\" answered the goosey-gander. \"But you must know very well that\nif you really wish to continue the trip, I can't be parted from you.\"\n\n\"That is just the answer I had expected from you,\" said the boy, and his\nvoice betrayed that he was relieved of a great anxiety.\n\nLater, when they travelled over Bohusl\u00c3\u00a4n, the boy observed that the\nmountain stretches were more continuous, the valleys were more like\nlittle ravines blasted in the rock foundation, while the long lakes at\ntheir base were as black as if they had come from the underworld. This,\ntoo, was a glorious country, and as the boy saw it, with now a strip of\nsun, now a shadow, he thought that there was something strange and wild\nabout it. He knew not why, but the idea came to him that once upon a\ntime there were many strong and brave heroes in these mystical regions\nwho had passed through many dangerous and daring adventures. The old\npassion of wanting to share in all sorts of wonderful adventures awoke\nin him.\n\n\"I might possibly miss not being in danger of my life at least once\nevery day or two,\" he thought. \"Anyhow it's best to be content with\nthings as they are.\"\n\nHe did not speak of this idea to the big white gander, because the geese\nwere now flying over Bohusl\u00c3\u00a4n with all the speed they could muster, and\nthe goosey-gander was puffing so hard that he would not have had the\nstrength to reply.\n\nThe sun was far down on the horizon, and disappeared every now and then\nbehind a hill; still the geese kept forging ahead.\n\nFinally, in the west, they saw a shining strip of light, which grew\nbroader and broader with every wing stroke. Soon the sea spread before\nthem, milk white with a shimmer of rose red and sky blue, and when they\nhad circled past the coast cliffs they saw the sun again, as it hung\nover the sea, big and red and ready to plunge into the waves.\n\nAs the boy gazed at the broad, endless sea and the red evening sun,\nwhich had such a kindly glow that he dared to look straight at it, he\nfelt a sense of peace and calm penetrate his soul.\n\n\"It's not worth while to be sad, Nils Holgersson,\" said the Sun. \"This\nis a beautiful world to live in both for big and little. It is also good\nto be free and happy, and to have a great dome of open sky above you.\"\n\nTHE GIFT OF THE WILD GEESE\n\nThe geese stood sleeping on a little rock islet just beyond Fj\u00c3\u00a4llbacka.\nWhen it drew on toward midnight, and the moon hung high in the heavens,\nold Akka shook the sleepiness out of her eyes. After that she walked\naround and awakened Yksi and Kaksi, Kolme and Nelj\u00c3\u00a4, Viisi and Kuusi,\nand, last of all, she gave Thumbietot a nudge with her bill that\nstartled him.\n\n\"What is it, Mother Akka?\" he asked, springing up in alarm.\n\n\"Nothing serious,\" assured the leader-goose. \"It's just this: we seven\nwho have been long together want to fly a short distance out to sea\nto-night, and we wondered if you would care to come with us.\"\n\nThe boy knew that Akka would not have proposed this move had there not\nbeen something important on foot, so he promptly seated himself on her\nback. The flight was straight west. The wild geese first flew over a\nbelt of large and small islands near the coast, then over a broad\nexpanse of open sea, till they reached the large cluster known as the\nV\u00c3\u00a4der Islands. All of them were low and rocky, and in the moonlight one\ncould see that they were rather large.\n\nAkka looked at one of the smallest islands and alighted there. It\nconsisted of a round, gray stone hill, with a wide cleft across it, into\nwhich the sea had cast fine, white sea sand and a few shells.\n\nAs the boy slid from the goose's back he noticed something quite close\nto him that looked like a jagged stone. But almost at once he saw that\nit was a big vulture which had chosen the rock island for a night\nharbour. Before the boy had time to wonder at the geese recklessly\nalighting so near a dangerous enemy, the bird flew up to them and the\nboy recognized Gorgo, the eagle.\n\nEvidently Akka and Gorgo had arranged the meeting, for neither of them\nwas taken by surprise.\n\n\"This was good of you, Gorgo,\" said Akka. \"I didn't expect that you\nwould be at the meeting place ahead of us. Have you been here long?\"\n\n\"I came early in the evening,\" replied Gorgo. \"But I fear that the only\npraise I deserve is for keeping my appointment with you. I've not been\nvery successful in carrying out the orders you gave me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure, Gorgo, that you have done more than you care to admit,\"\nassured Akka. \"But before you relate your experiences on the trip, I\nshall ask Thumbietot to help me find something which is supposed to be\nburied on this island.\"\n\nThe boy stood gazing admiringly at two beautiful shells, but when Akka\nspoke his name, he glanced up.\n\n\"You must have wondered, Thumbietot, why we turned out of our course to\nfly here to the West Sea,\" said Akka.\n\n\"To be frank, I did think it strange,\" answered the boy. \"But I knew, of\ncourse, that you always have some good reason for whatever you do.\"\n\n\"You have a good opinion of me,\" returned Akka, \"but I almost fear you\nwill lose it now, for it's very probable that we have made this journey\nin vain.\n\n\"Many years ago it happened that two of the other old geese and myself\nencountered frightful storms during a spring flight and were wind-driven\nto this island. When we discovered that there was only open sea before\nus, we feared we should be swept so far out that we should never find\nour way back to land, so we lay down on the waves between these bare\ncliffs, where the storm compelled us to remain for several days.\n\n\"We suffered terribly from hunger; once we ventured up to the cleft on\nthis island in search of food. We couldn't find a green blade, but we\nsaw a number of securely tied bags half buried in the sand. We hoped to\nfind grain in the bags and pulled and tugged at them till we tore the\ncloth. However, no grain poured out, but shining gold pieces. For such\nthings we wild geese had no use, so we left them where they were. We\nhaven't thought of the find in all these years; but this autumn\nsomething has come up to make us wish for gold.\n\n\"We do not know that the treasure is still here, but we have travelled\nall this way to ask you to look into the matter.\"\n\nWith a shell in either hand the boy jumped down into the cleft and began\nto scoop up the sand. He found no bags, but when he had made a deep hole\nhe heard the clink of metal and saw that he had come upon a gold piece.\nThen he dug with his fingers and felt many coins in the sand. So he\nhurried back to Akka.\n\n\"The bags have rotted and fallen apart,\" he exclaimed, \"and the money\nlies scattered all through the sand.\"\n\n\"That's well!\" said Akka. \"Now fill in the hole and smooth it over so no\none will notice the sand has been disturbed.\"\n\nThe boy did as he was told, but when he came up from the cleft he was\nastonished to see that the wild geese were lined up, with Akka in the\nlead, and were marching toward him with great solemnity.\n\nThe geese paused in front of him, and all bowed their heads many times,\nlooking so grave that he had to doff his cap and make an obeisance to\nthem.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Akka, \"we old geese have been thinking that if\nThumbietot had been in the service of human beings and had done as much\nfor them as he has for us they would not let him go without rewarding\nhim well.\"\n\n\"I haven't helped you; it is you who have taken good care of me,\"\nreturned the boy.\n\n\"We think also,\" continued Akka, \"that when a human being has attended\nus on a whole journey he shouldn't be allowed to leave us as poor as\nwhen he came.\"\n\n\"I know that what I have learned this year with you is worth more to me\nthan gold or lands,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Since these gold coins have been lying unclaimed in the cleft all these\nyears, I think that you ought to have them,\" declared the wild goose.\n\n\"I thought you said something about needing this money yourselves,\"\nreminded the boy.\n\n\"We do need it, so as to be able to give you such recompense as will\nmake your mother and father think you have been working as a goose boy\nwith worthy people.\"\n\nThe boy turned half round and cast a glance toward the sea, then faced\nabout and looked straight into Akka's bright eyes.\n\n\"I think it strange, Mother Akka, that you turn me away from your\nservice like this and pay me off before I have given you notice,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"As long as we wild geese remain in Sweden, I trust that you will stay\nwith us,\" said Akka. \"I only wanted to show you where the treasure was\nwhile we could get to it without going too far out of our course.\"\n\n\"All the same it looks as if you wished to be rid of me before I want to\ngo,\" argued Thumbietot. \"After all the good times we have had together,\nI think you ought to let me go abroad with you.\"\n\nWhen the boy said this, Akka and the other wild geese stretched their\nlong necks straight up and stood a moment, with bills half open,\ndrinking in air.\n\n\"That is something I haven't thought about,\" said Akka, when she\nrecovered herself. \"Before you decide to come with us, we had better\nhear what Gorgo has to say. You may as well know that when we left\nLapland the agreement between Gorgo and myself was that he should travel\nto your home down in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne to try to make better terms for you with the\nelf.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" affirmed Gorgo, \"but as I have already told you, luck\nwas against me. I soon hunted up Holger Nilsson's croft and after\ncircling up and down over the place a couple of hours, I caught sight of\nthe elf, skulking along between the sheds.\n\n\"Immediately I swooped down upon him and flew off with him to a meadow\nwhere we could talk together without interruption.\n\n\"I told him that I had been sent by Akka from Kebnekaise to ask if he\ncouldn't give Nils Holgersson easier terms.\n\n\"'I only wish I could!' he answered, 'for I have heard that he has\nconducted himself well on the trip; but it is not in my power to do so.'\n\n\"Then I was wrathy and said that I would bore out his eyes unless he\ngave in.\n\n\"'You may do as you like,' he retorted, 'but as to Nils Holgersson, it\nwill turn out exactly as I have said. You can tell him from me that he\nwould do well to return soon with his goose, for matters on the farm are\nin a bad shape. His father has had to forfeit a bond for his brother,\nwhom he trusted. He has bought a horse with borrowed money, and the\nbeast went lame the first time he drove it. Since then it has been of no\nearthly use to him. Tell Nils Holgersson that his parents have had to\nsell two of the cows and that they must give up the croft unless they\nreceive help from somewhere.\"\n\nWhen the boy heard this he frowned and clenched his fists so hard that\nthe nails dug into his flesh.\n\n\"It is cruel of the elf to make the conditions so hard for me that I can\nnot go home and relieve my parents, but he sha'n't turn me into a\ntraitor to a friend! My father and mother are square and upright folk. I\nknow they would rather forfeit my help than have me come back to them\nwith a guilty conscience.\"\n\n\nTHE JOURNEY TO VEMMINGH\u00c3\u0096G\n\n\n_Thursday, November third_.\n\nOne day in the beginning of November the wild geese flew over Halland\nRidge and into Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. For several weeks they had been resting on the\nwide plains around Falk\u00c3\u00b6ping. As many other wild goose flocks also\nstopped there, the grown geese had had a pleasant time visiting with old\nfriends, and there had been all kinds of games and races between the\nyounger birds.\n\nNils Holgersson had not been happy over the delay in Westerg\u00c3\u00b6tland. He\nhad tried to keep a stout heart; but it was hard for him to reconcile\nhimself to his fate.\n\n\"If I were only well out of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne and in some foreign land,\" he had\nthought, \"I should know for certain that I had nothing to hope for, and\nwould feel easier in my mind.\"\n\nFinally, one morning, the geese started out and flew toward Halland.\n\nIn the beginning the boy took very little interest in that province. He\nthought there was nothing new to be seen there. But when the wild geese\ncontinued the journey farther south, along the narrow coast-lands, the\nboy leaned over the goose's neck and did not take his glance from the\nground.\n\nHe saw the hills gradually disappear and the plain spread under him, at\nthe same time he noticed that the coast became less rugged, while the\ngroup of islands beyond thinned and finally vanished and the broad, open\nsea came clear up to firm land. Here there were no more forests: here\nthe plain was supreme. It spread all the way to the horizon. A land that\nlay so exposed, with field upon field, reminded the boy of Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. He\nfelt both happy and sad as he looked at it.\n\n\"I can't be very far from home,\" he thought.\n\nMany times during the trip the goslings had asked the old geese:\n\n\"How does it look in foreign lands?\"\n\n\"Wait, wait! You shall soon see,\" the old geese had answered.\n\nWhen the wild geese had passed Halland Ridge and gone a distance into\nSk\u00c3\u00a5ne, Akka called out:\n\n\"Now look down! Look all around! It is like this in foreign lands.\"\n\nJust then they flew over S\u00c3\u00b6der Ridge. The whole long range of hills was\nclad in beech woods, and beautiful, turreted castles peeped out here and\nthere.\n\nAmong the trees grazed roe-buck, and on the forest meadow romped the\nhares. Hunters' horns sounded from the forests; the loud baying of dogs\ncould be heard all the way up to the wild geese. Broad avenues wound\nthrough the trees and on these ladies and gentlemen were driving in\npolished carriages or riding fine horses. At the foot of the ridge lay\nRing Lake with the ancient Bosj\u00c3\u00b6 Cloister on a narrow peninsula.\n\n\"Does it look like this in foreign lands?\" asked the goslings.\n\n\"It looks exactly like this wherever there are forest-clad ridges,\"\nreplied Akka, \"only one doesn't see many of them. Wait! You shall see\nhow it looks in general.\"\n\nAkka led the geese farther south to the great Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne plain. There it\nspread, with grain fields; with acres and acres of sugar beets, where\nthe beet-pickers were at work; with low whitewashed farm- and outhouses;\nwith numberless little white churches; with ugly, gray sugar refineries\nand small villages near the railway stations. Little beech-encircled\nmeadow lakes, each of them adorned by its own stately manor, shimmered\nhere and there.\n\n\"Now look down! Look carefully!\" called the leader-goose. \"Thus it is in\nforeign lands, from the Baltic coast all the way down to the high Alps.\nFarther than that I have never travelled.\"\n\nWhen the goslings had seen the plain, the leader-goose flew down the\n\u00c3\u0096resund coast. Swampy meadows sloped gradually toward the sea. In some\nplaces were high, steep banks, in others drift-sand fields, where the\nsand lay heaped in banks and hills. Fishing hamlets stood all along the\ncoast, with long rows of low, uniform brick houses, with a lighthouse at\nthe edge of the breakwater, and brown fishing nets hanging in the drying\nyard.\n\n\"Now look down! Look well! This is how it looks along the coasts in\nforeign lands.\"\n\nAfter Akka had been flying about in this manner a long time she alighted\nsuddenly on a marsh in Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g township and the boy could not help\nthinking that she had travelled over Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne just to let him see that his\nwas a country which could compare favourably with any in the world. This\nwas unnecessary, for the boy was not thinking of whether the country was\nrich or poor.\n\nFrom the moment that he had seen the first willow grove his heart ached\nwith homesickness.\n\nHOME AT LAST\n\n\n_Tuesday, November eighth_.\n\nThe atmosphere was dull and hazy. The wild geese had been feeding on the\nbig meadow around Skerup church and were having their noonday rest when\nAkka came up to the boy.\n\n\"It looks as if we should have calm weather for awhile,\" she remarked,\n\"and I think we'll cross the Baltic to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the boy abruptly, for his throat contracted so that he\ncould hardly speak. All along he had cherished the hope that he would be\nreleased from the enchantment while he was still in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne.\n\n\"We are quite near West Vemmingh\u00c3\u00b6g now,\" said Akka, \"and I thought that\nperhaps you might like to go home for awhile. It may be some time before\nyou have another opportunity to see your people.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had better not,\" said the boy hesitatingly, but something in\nhis voice betrayed that he was glad of Akka's proposal.\n\n\"If the goosey-gander remains with us, no harm can come to him,\" Akka\nassured. \"I think you had better find out how your parents are getting\nalong. You might be of some help to them, even if you're not a normal\nboy.\"\n\n\"You are right, Mother Akka. I should have thought of that long ago,\"\nsaid the boy impulsively.\n\nThe next second he and the leader-goose were on their way to his home.\nIt was not long before Akka alighted behind the stone hedge encircling\nthe little farm.\n\n\"Strange how natural everything looks around here!\" the boy remarked,\nquickly clambering to the top of the hedge, so that he could look about.\n\n\"It seems to me only yesterday that I first saw you come flying through\nthe air.\"\n\n\"I wonder if your father has a gun,\" said Akka suddenly.\n\n\"You may be sure he has,\" returned the boy. \"It was just the gun that\nkept me at home that Sunday morning when I should have been at church.\"\n\n\"Then I don't dare to stand here and wait for you,\" said Akka. \"You had\nbetter meet us at Smygah\u00c3\u00b6k early to-morrow morning, so that you may stay\nat home over night.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't go yet, Mother Akka!\" begged the boy, jumping from the hedge.\n\nHe could not tell just why it was, but he felt as if something would\nhappen, either to the wild goose or to himself, to prevent their future\nmeeting.\n\n\"No doubt you see that I'm distressed because I cannot get back my\nright form; but I want to say to you that I don't regret having gone\nwith you last spring,\" he added. \"I would rather forfeit the chance of\never being human again than to have missed that trip.\"\n\nAkka breathed quickly before she answered.\n\n\"There's a little matter I should have mentioned to you before this, but\nsince you are not going back to your home for good, I thought there was\nno hurry about it. Still it may as well be said now.\"\n\n\"You know very well that I am always glad to do your bidding,\" said the\nboy.\n\n\"If you have learned anything at all from us, Thumbietot, you no longer\nthink that the humans should have the whole earth to themselves,\" said\nthe wild goose, solemnly. \"Remember you have a large country and you can\neasily afford to leave a few bare rocks, a few shallow lakes and swamps,\na few desolate cliffs and remote forests to us poor, dumb creatures,\nwhere we can be allowed to live in peace. All my days I have been\nhounded and hunted. It would be a comfort to know that there is a refuge\nsomewhere for one like me.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I should be glad to help if I could,\" said the boy, \"but it's\nnot likely that I shall ever again have any influence among human\nbeings.\"\n\n\"Well, we're standing here talking as if we were never to meet again,\"\nsaid Akka, \"but we shall see each other to-morrow, of course. Now I'll\nreturn to my flock.\"\n\nShe spread her wings and started to fly, but came back and stroked\nThumbietot up and down with her bill before she flew away.\n\nIt was broad daylight, but no human being moved on the farm and the boy\ncould go where he pleased. He hastened to the cow shed, because he knew\nthat he could get the best information from the cows.\n\nIt looked rather barren in their shed. In the spring there had been\nthree fine cows there, but now there was only one--Mayrose. It was quite\napparent that she yearned for her comrades. Her head drooped sadly, and\nshe had hardly touched the feed in her crib.\n\n\"Good day, Mayrose!\" said the boy, running fearlessly into her stall.\n\n\"How are mother and father? How are the cat and the chickens? What has\nbecome of Star and Gold-Lily?\"\n\nWhen Mayrose heard the boy's voice she started, and appeared as if she\nwere going to gore him. But she was not so quick-tempered now as\nformerly, and took time to look well at Nils Holgersson.\n\nHe was just as little now as when he went away, and wore the same\nclothes; yet he was completely changed. The Nils Holgersson that went\naway in the spring had a heavy, slow gait, a drawling speech, and sleepy\neyes. The one that had come back was lithe and alert, ready of speech,\nand had eyes that sparkled and danced. He had a confident bearing that\ncommanded respect, little as he was. Although he himself did not look\nhappy, he inspired happiness in others.\n\n\"Moo!\" bellowed Mayrose. \"They told me that he was changed, but I\ncouldn't believe it. Welcome home, Nils Holgersson! Welcome home! This\nis the first glad moment I have known for ever so long!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mayrose!\" said the boy, who was very happy to be so well\nreceived.\n\n\"Now tell me all about father and mother.\"\n\n\"They have had nothing but hardship ever since you went away,\" said\nMayrose. \"The horse has been a costly care all summer, for he has stood\nin the stable the whole time and not earned his feed. Your father is too\nsoft-hearted to shoot him and he can't sell him. It was on account of\nthe horse that both Star and Gold-Lily had to be sold.\"\n\nThere was something else the boy wanted badly to know, but he was\ndiffident about asking the question point blank. Therefore he said:\n\n\"Mother must have felt very sorry when she discovered that Morten\nGoosey-Gander had flown?\"\n\n\"She wouldn't have worried much about Morten Goosey-Gander had she\nknown the way he came to leave. She grieves most at the thought of her\nson having run away from home with a goosey-gander.\"\n\n\"Does she really think that I _stole_ the goosey-gander?\" said the boy.\n\n\"What else could she think?\"\n\n\"Father and mother must fancy that I've been roaming about the country,\nlike a common tramp?\"\n\n\"They think that you've gone to the dogs,\" said Mayrose. \"They have\nmourned you as one mourns the loss of the dearest thing on earth.\"\n\nAs soon as the boy heard this, he rushed from the cow shed and down to\nthe stable.\n\nIt was small, but clean and tidy. Everything showed that his father had\ntried to make the place comfortable for the new horse. In the stall\nstood a strong, fine animal that looked well fed and well cared for.\n\n\"Good day to you!\" said the boy. \"I have heard that there's a sick horse\nin here. Surely it can't be you, who look so healthy and strong.\"\n\nThe horse turned his head and stared fixedly at the boy.\n\n\"Are you the son?\" he queried. \"I have heard many bad reports of him.\nBut you have such a good face, I couldn't believe that you were he, did\nI not know that he was transformed into an elf.\"\n\n\"I know that I left a bad name behind me when I went away from the\nfarm,\" admitted Nils Holgersson. \"My own mother thinks I am a thief. But\nwhat matters it--I sha'n't tarry here long. Meanwhile, I want to know\nwhat ails you.\"\n\n\"Pity you're not going to stay,\" said the horse, \"for I have the feeling\nthat you and I might become good friends. I've got something in my\nfoot--the point of a knife, or something sharp--that's all that ails me.\nIt has gone so far in that the doctor can't find it, but it cuts so that\nI can't walk. If you would only tell your father what's wrong with me,\nI'm sure that he could help me. I should like to be of some use. I\nreally feel ashamed to stand here and feed without doing any work.\"\n\n\"It's well that you have no real illness,\" remarked Nils Holgersson. \"I\nmust attend to this at once, so that you will be all right again. You\ndon't mind if I do a little scratching on your hoof with my knife, do\nyou?\"\n\nNils Holgersson had just finished, when he heard the sound of voices. He\nopened the stable door a little and peeped out.\n\nHis father and mother were coming down the lane. It was easy to see that\nthey were broken by many sorrows. His mother had many lines on her face\nand his father's hair had turned gray. She was talking with him about\ngetting a loan from her brother-in-law.\n\n\"No, I don't want to borrow any more money,\" his father said, as they\nwere passing the stable. \"There's nothing quite so hard as being in\ndebt. It would be better to sell the cabin.\"\n\n\"If it were not for the boy, I shouldn't mind selling it,\" his mother\ndemurred. \"But what will become of him, if he returns some day, wretched\nand poor--as he's likely to be--and we not here?\"\n\n\"You're right about that,\" the father agreed. \"But we shall have to ask\nthe folks who take the place to receive him kindly and to let him know\nthat he's welcome back to us. We sha'n't say a harsh word to him, no\nmatter what he may be, shall we mother?\"\n\n\"No, indeed! If I only had him again, so that I could be certain he is\nnot starving and freezing on the highways, I'd ask nothing more!\"\n\nThen his father and mother went in, and the boy heard no more of their\nconversation.\n\nHe was happy and deeply moved when he knew that they loved him so\ndearly, although they believed he had gone astray. He longed to rush\ninto their arms.\n\n\"But perhaps it would be an even greater sorrow were they to see me as I\nnow am.\"\n\nWhile he stood there, hesitating, a cart drove up to the gate. The boy\nsmothered a cry of surprise, for who should step from the cart and go\ninto the house yard but Osa, the goose girl, and her father!\n\nThey walked hand in hand toward the cabin. When they were about half\nway there, Osa stopped her father and said:\n\n\"Now remember, father, you are not to mention the wooden shoe or the\ngeese or the little brownie who was so like Nils Holgersson that if it\nwas not himself it must have had some connection with him.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Jon Esserson. \"I shall only say that their son has\nbeen of great help to you on several occasions--when you were trying to\nfind me--and that therefore we have come to ask if we can't do them a\nservice in return, since I'm a rich man now and have more than I need,\nthanks to the mine I discovered up in Lapland.\"\n\n\"I know, father, that you can say the right thing in the right way,\" Osa\ncommended. \"It is only that one particular thing that I don't wish you\nto mention.\"\n\nThey went into the cabin, and the boy would have liked to hear what they\ntalked about in there; but he dared not venture near the house. It was\nnot long before they came out again, and his father and mother\naccompanied them as far as the gate.\n\nHis parents were strangely happy. They appeared to have gained a new\nhold on life.\n\nWhen the visitors were gone, father and mother lingered at the gate\ngazing after them.\n\n\"I don't feel unhappy any longer, since I've heard so much that is good\nof our Nils,\" said his mother.\n\n\"Perhaps he got more praise than he really deserved,\" put in his father\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Wasn't it enough for you that they came here specially to say they\nwanted to help us because our Nils had served them in many ways? I\nthink, father, that you should have accepted their offer.\"\n\n\"No, mother, I don't wish to accept money from any one, either as a gift\nor a loan. In the first place I want to free myself from all debt, then\nwe will work our way up again. We're not so very old, are we, mother?\"\nThe father laughed heartily as he said this.\n\n\"I believe you think it will be fun to sell this place, upon which we\nhave expended such a lot of time and hard work,\" protested the mother.\n\n\"Oh, you know why I'm laughing,\" the father retorted. \"It was the\nthought of the boy's having gone to the bad that weighed me down until I\nhad no strength or courage left in me. Now that I know he still lives\nand has turned out well, you'll see that Holger Nilsson has some grit\nleft.\"\n\nThe mother went in alone, and the boy made haste to hide in a corner,\nfor his father walked into the stable. He went over to the horse and\nexamined its hoof, as usual, to try to discover what was wrong with it.\n\n\"What's this!\" he cried, discovering some letters scratched on the\nhoof.\n\n\"Remove the sharp piece of iron from the foot,\" he read and glanced\naround inquiringly. However, he ran his fingers along the under side of\nthe hoof and looked at it carefully.\n\n\"I verily believe there is something sharp here!\" he said.\n\nWhile his father was busy with the horse and the boy sat huddled in a\ncorner, it happened that other callers came to the farm.\n\nThe fact was that when Morten Goosey-Gander found himself so near his\nold home he simply could not resist the temptation of showing his wife\nand children to his old companions on the farm. So he took Dunfin and\nthe goslings along, and made for home.\n\nThere was not a soul in the barn yard when the goosey-gander came along.\nHe alighted, confidently walked all around the place, and showed Dunfin\nhow luxuriously he had lived when he was a tame goose.\n\nWhen they had viewed the entire farm, he noticed that the door of the\ncow shed was open.\n\n\"Look in here a moment,\" he said, \"then you will see how I lived in\nformer days. It was very different from camping in swamps and morasses,\nas we do now.\"\n\nThe goosey-gander stood in the doorway and looked into the cow shed.\n\n\"There's not a soul in here,\" he said. \"Come along, Dunfin, and you\nshall see the goose pen. Don't be afraid; there's no danger.\"\n\nForthwith the goosey-gander, Dunfin, and all six goslings waddled into\nthe goose pen, to have a look at the elegance and comfort in which the\nbig white gander had lived before he joined the wild geese.\n\n\"This is the way it used to be: here was my place and over there was the\ntrough, which was always filled with oats and water,\" explained the\ngoosey-gander.\n\n\"Wait! there's some fodder in it now.\" With that he rushed to the trough\nand began to gobble up the oats.\n\nBut Dunfin was nervous.\n\n\"Let's go out again!\" she said.\n\n\"Only two more grains,\" insisted the goosey-gander. The next second he\nlet out a shriek and ran for the door, but it was too late! The door\nslammed, the mistress stood without and bolted it. They were locked in!\n\nThe father had removed a sharp piece of iron from the horse's hoof and\nstood contentedly stroking the animal when the mother came running into\nthe stable.\n\n\"Come, father, and see the capture I've made!\"\n\n\"No, wait a minute!\" said the father. \"Look here, first. I have\ndiscovered what ailed the horse.\"\n\n\"I believe our luck has turned,\" said the mother. \"Only fancy! the big\nwhite goosey-gander that disappeared last spring must have gone off with\nthe wild geese. He has come back to us in company with seven wild geese.\nThey walked straight into the goose pen, and I've shut them all in.\"\n\n\"That's extraordinary,\" remarked the father. \"But best of all is that we\ndon't have to think any more that our boy stole the goosey-gander when\nhe went away.\"\n\n\"You're quite right, father,\" she said. \"But I'm afraid we'll have to\nkill them to-night. In two days is Morten Gooseday[1] and we must make\nhaste if we expect to get them to market in time.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: In Sweden the 10th of November is called Morten Gooseday\nand corresponds to the American Thanksgiving Day.]\n\n\"I think it would be outrageous to butcher the goosey-gander, now that\nhe has returned to us with such a large family,\" protested Holger\nNilsson.\n\n\"If times were easier we'd let him live; but since we're going to move\nfrom here, we can't keep geese. Come along now and help me carry them\ninto the kitchen,\" urged the mother.\n\nThey went out together and in a few moments the boy saw his father\ncoming along with Morten Goosey-Gander and Dunfin--one under each arm.\nHe and his wife went into the cabin.\n\nThe goosey-gander cried:\n\n\"Thumbietot, come and help me!\"--as he always did when in\nperil--although he was not aware that the boy was at hand.\n\nNils Holgersson heard him, yet he lingered at the door of the cow shed.\n\nHe did not hesitate because he knew that it would be well for him if the\ngoosey-gander were beheaded--at that moment he did not even remember\nthis--but because he shrank from being seen by his parents.\n\n\"They have a hard enough time of it already,\" he thought. \"Must I bring\nthem a new sorrow?\"\n\nBut when the door closed on the goosey-gander, the boy was aroused.\n\nHe dashed across the house yard, sprang up on the board-walk leading to\nthe entrance door and ran into the hallway, where he kicked off his\nwooden shoes in the old accustomed way, and walked toward the door.\n\nAll the while it went so much against the grain to appear before his\nfather and mother that he could not raise his hand to knock.\n\n\"But this concerns the life of the goosey-gander,\" he said to\nhimself--\"he who has been my best friend ever since I last stood here.\"\n\nIn a twinkling the boy remembered all that he and the goosey-gander had\nsuffered on ice-bound lakes and stormy seas and among wild beasts of\nprey. His heart swelled with gratitude; he conquered himself and knocked\non the door.\n\n\"Is there some one who wishes to come in?\" asked his father, opening the\ndoor.\n\n\"Mother, you sha'n't touch the goosey-gander!\" cried the boy.\n\nInstantly both the goosey-gander and Dunfin, who lay on a bench with\ntheir feet tied, gave a cry of joy, so that he was sure they were alive.\n\nSome one else gave a cry of joy--his _mother_!\n\n\"My, but you have grown tall and handsome!\" she exclaimed.\n\nThe boy had not entered the cabin, but was standing on the doorstep,\nlike one who is not quite certain how he will be received.\n\n\"The Lord be praised that I have you back again!\" said his mother,\nlaughing and crying. \"Come in, my boy! Come in!\"\n\n\"Welcome!\" added his father, and not another word could he utter.\n\nBut the boy still lingered at the threshold. He could not comprehend why\nthey were so glad to see him--such as he was. Then his mother came and\nput her arms around him and drew him into the room, and he knew that he\nwas all right.\n\n\"Mother and father!\" he cried. \"I'm a big boy. I am a human being\nagain!\"\n\n\nTHE PARTING WITH THE WILD GEESE\n\n\n_Wednesday, November ninth_.\n\nThe boy arose before dawn and wandered down to the coast. He was\nstanding alone on the strand east of Smyge fishing hamlet before\nsunrise. He had already been in the pen with Morten Goosey-Gander to try\nto rouse him, but the big white gander had no desire to leave home. He\ndid not say a word, but only stuck his bill under his wing and went to\nsleep again.\n\nTo all appearances the weather promised to be almost as perfect as it\nhad been that spring day when the wild geese came to Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne. There was\nhardly a ripple on the water; the air was still and the boy thought of\nthe good passage the geese would have. He himself was as yet in a kind\nof daze--sometimes thinking he was an elf, sometimes a human being. When\nhe saw a stone hedge alongside the road, he was afraid to go farther\nuntil he had made sure that no wild animal or vulture lurked behind it.\nVery soon he laughed to himself and rejoiced because he was big and\nstrong and did not have to be afraid of anything.\n\nWhen he reached the coast he stationed himself, big as he was, at the\nvery edge of the strand, so that the wild geese could see him.\n\nIt was a busy day for the birds of passage. Bird calls sounded on the\nair continuously. The boy smiled as he thought that no one but himself\nunderstood what the birds were saying to one another. Presently wild\ngeese came flying; one big flock following another.\n\n\"Just so it's not my geese that are going away without bidding me\nfarewell,\" he thought. He wanted so much to tell them how everything had\nturned out, and to show them that he was no longer an elf but a human\nbeing.\n\nThere came a flock that flew faster and cackled louder than the others,\nand something told him that this must be _the_ flock, but now he was not\nquite so sure about it as he would have been the day before.\n\nThe flock slackened its flight and circled up and down along the coast.\n\nThe boy knew it was the right one, but he could not understand why the\ngeese did not come straight down to him. They could not avoid seeing him\nwhere he stood. He tried to give a call that would bring them down to\nhim, but only think! his tongue would not obey him. He could not make\nthe right sound! He heard Akka's calls, but did not understand what she\nsaid.\n\n\"What can this mean? Have the wild geese changed their language?\" he\nwondered.\n\nHe waved his cap to them and ran along the shore calling.\n\n\"Here am I, where are you?\"\n\nBut this seemed only to frighten the geese. They rose and flew farther\nout to sea. At last he understood. They did not know that he was human,\nhad not recognized him. He could not call them to him because human\nbeings can not speak the language of birds. He could not speak their\nlanguage, nor could he understand it.\n\nAlthough the boy was very glad to be released from the enchantment,\nstill he thought it hard that because of this he should be parted from\nhis old comrades.\n\nHe sat down on the sands and buried his face in his hands. What was the\nuse of his gazing after them any more?\n\nPresently he heard the rustle of wings. Old mother Akka had found it\nhard to fly away from Thumbietot, and turned back, and now that the boy\nsat quite still she ventured to fly nearer to him. Suddenly something\nmust have told her who he was, for she lit close beside him.\n\nNils gave a cry of joy and took old Akka in his arms. The other wild\ngeese crowded round him and stroked him with their bills. They cackled\nand chattered and wished him all kinds of good luck, and he, too, talked\nto them and thanked them for the wonderful journey which he had been\nprivileged to make in their company.\n\nAll at once the wild geese became strangely quiet and withdrew from him,\nas if to say:\n\n\"Alas! he is a man. He does not understand us: we do not understand\nhim!\"\n\nThen the boy rose and went over to Akka; he stroked her and patted her.\nHe did the same to Yksi and Kaksi, Kolme and Nelj\u00c3\u00a4, Viisi and Kuusi--the\nold birds who had been his companions from the very start.\n\nAfter that he walked farther up the strand. He knew perfectly well that\nthe sorrows of the birds do not last long, and he wanted to part with\nthem while they were still sad at losing him.\n\nAs he crossed the shore meadows he turned and watched the many flocks of\nbirds that were flying over the sea. All were shrieking their coaxing\ncalls--only one goose flock flew silently on as long as he could follow\nit with his eyes. The wedge was perfect, the speed good, and the wing\nstrokes strong and certain.\n\nThe boy felt such a yearning for his departing comrades that he almost\nwished he were Thumbietot again and could travel over land and sea with\na flock of wild geese.\n\n\nTABLE OF PRONUNCIATION\n\n\nThe final _e_ is sounded in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne, Sirle, Gripe, etc.\n\nThe _\u00c3\u00a5_ in Sk\u00c3\u00a5ne and Sm\u00c3\u00a5land is pronounced like _o_ in ore.\n\n_j_ is like the English _y_. Nuolja, Oviksfj\u00c3\u00a4llen, Sjangeli, Jarro,\netc., should sound as if they were spelled like this: Nuolya,\nOviksfyellen, Syang [one syllable] elee, Yarro, etc.\n\n_g_, when followed by _e, i, y, \u00c3\u00a4, \u00c3\u00b6_, is also like _y_. Example, G\u00c3\u00b6ta\nis pronounced Y\u00c3\u00b6ta.\n\nWhen _g_ is followed by _a, o, u_, or _\u00c3\u00a5_, it is hard, as in go.\n\n_k_ in Norrk\u00c3\u00b6ping, Link\u00c3\u00b6ping, Kivik (pronounced Cheeveek), etc., is like\n_ch_ in cheer.\n\n_k_ is hard when it precedes _a, o, u_, or _\u00c3\u00a5_.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":519,"split":"train"}
