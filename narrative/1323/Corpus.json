Realising that he has offended her, the Colonel gives Laura a more honourable proposal of marriage, but she refuses him gently on grounds of moral incompatibility, despite this meaning that she would miss out on the Colonel's title and fortune. Captain Montreville, Laura's father, finds out that Laura's annuity is not assured, and so takes Laura to London to fix the matter. Without the knowledge of her father, Laura consents to marry the Colonel eventually, if he can reform himself within two years.\nWhen she is left without any money in London, she decides to support her ailing father by selling sketches. During her time in London, a man named Montague De Courcy begins to fall in love with her. De Courcy buys Laura's sketches in secret. Hargrave follows Laura to London, and he becomes involved in an affair with a married woman. Hargrave meets Laura in the shop where she sells her sketches and paintings, and accompanies her home and harasses her. Hargrave's affair is found out by his lover's husband, and the two men duel. Hargrave wounds the husband, and then goes to Laura, urging her to marry him before she finds out about his affair. Because Hargrave threatens to kill himself, Laura faints, and is found by her father, who then realises that Hargrave has been threatening his daughter, and he has been encouraging Hargrave. This causes Captain Montreville such grief that he dies the next morning. When Captain Montreville dies of his illness, Laura goes to live with Lady Pelham, her maternal aunt. Lady Pelham helps Laura receive her annuity, but she is not religious and colludes with Colonel Hargrave. Laura learns of Hargrave's duel, and resolves to refuse him. Hargrave attempts to persuade her to marry him by more drastic measures - having her arrested under false pretenses, tricking her into joining a gambling party, and when Lady Pelham dies, Hargrave kidnaps Laura and takes her to the wilderness of America. He plans to rape and then force Laura into marriage - she fakes her own death by escaping down the rapids in a canoe, which she ties herself to. Hargrave commits suicide, and Laura returns to her home country, where she marries Montague De Courcy and has five children with him.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Self-control, by Mary Brunton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Unknown to the world both\nas an individual and as an author, I own myself desirous of giving a\npledge of spotless intention in my work, by adorning it with the name of\none whose writings force every unvitiated heart to glow with a warmer\nlove of virtue. On one solitary point I claim equality with you:--In\npurity of intention I yield not even to JOANNA BAILLIE.\n\nMay I venture to avow another feeling which has prompted this intrusion?\nWhat point so small that vanity cannot build on it a resting-place! Will\nyou believe that this trifle claims affinity with the Plays on the\nPassions?--Your portraitures of the progress and of the consequences of\npassion,--portraitures whose exquisite truth gives them the force of\nliving examples,--are powerful warnings to watch the first risings of\nthe insidious rebel. No guard but one is equal to the task. The\nregulation of the passions is the province, it is the triumph of\nRELIGION. In the character of Laura Montreville the religious principle\nis exhibited as rejecting the bribes of ambition; bestowing fortitude in\nwant and sorrow; as restraining just displeasure; overcoming\nconstitutional timidity; conquering misplaced affection; and triumphing\nover the fear of death and of disgrace.\n\nThis little tale was begun at first merely for my own amusement. It is\npublished that I may reconcile my conscience to the time which it has\nemployed, by making it in some degree useful. Let not the term so\nimplied provoke a smile! If my book is read, its uses to the author are\nobvious. Nor is a work of fiction necessarily unprofitable to the\nreaders. When the vitiated appetite refuses its proper food, the\nalternative may be administered in a sweetmeat. It may be imprudent to\nconfess the presence of the medicine, lest the sickly palate, thus\nwarned, turn from it in loathing. But I rely in this instance on the\nworld of the philosopher, who avers that 'young ladies never read\nprefaces'; and I am not without hope, that with you, and with all who\nform exceptions to this rule, the avowal of a useful purpose may be an\ninducement to tolerate what otherwise might be thought unworthy of\nregard.\n\nPerhaps in an age whose lax morality, declining the glorious toils of\nvirtue, is poorly 'content to dwell in decencies for ever', emulation\nmay be repressed by the eminence which the character of Laura claims\nover the ordinary standard of the times. A virtue which, though\nessentially Christian, is certainly not very popular in this Christian\ncountry, may be stigmatized as romantic; a chilling term of reproach,\nwhich has blighted many a fair blossom of goodness ere it ripened into\nfruit. Perhaps some of my fair countrywomen, finding it difficult to\ntrace in the delineation of Self-Control any striking feature of their\nown minds, may pronounce my picture unnatural. It might be enough to\nreply, that I do not ascribe any of the virtues of Laura to nature, and,\nleast of all, the one whose office is to regulate and control nature.\nBut if my principal figure want the air, and vivacity of life, the blame\nlies in the painter, not in the subject. Laura is indebted to fancy for\nher drapery and attitudes alone. I have had the happiness of witnessing,\nin real life, a self-command operating with as much force, permanence,\nand uniformity, as that which is depicted in the following volumes. To\nyou, Madam, I should perhaps further apologize for having left in my\nmodel some traces of human imperfection; while, for the generality of my\nreaders, I breathe a fervent wish, that these pages may assist in\nenabling their own hearts to furnish proof that the character of Laura,\nhowever unnatural, is yet not unattainable.\n\n  I have the honour to be,\n    with great respect,\n      Madam,\n        Your obedient Servant,\n          The AUTHOR\n\n                                          January 1811.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n  Chapter I               1\n\n  Chapter II             10\n\n  Chapter III            18\n\n  Chapter IV             23\n\n  Chapter V              33\n\n  Chapter VI             39\n\n  Chapter VII            45\n\n  Chapter VIII           56\n\n  Chapter IX             62\n\n  Chapter X              73\n\n  Chapter XI             82\n\n  Chapter XII            90\n\n  Chapter XIII          102\n\n  Chapter XIV           116\n\n  Chapter XV            132\n\n  Chapter XVI           147\n\n  Chapter XVII          161\n\n  Chapter XVIII         185\n\n  Chapter XIX           201\n\n  Chapter XX            215\n\n  Chapter XXI           229\n\n  Chapter XXII          242\n\n  Chapter XXIII         260\n\n  Chapter XXIV          270\n\n  Chapter XXV           283\n\n  Chapter XXVI          298\n\n  Chapter XXVII         312\n\n  Chapter XXVIII        329\n\n  Chapter XXIX          346\n\n  Chapter XXX           367\n\n  Chapter XXXI          387\n\n  Chapter XXXII         402\n\n  Chapter XXXIII        413\n\n  Chapter XXXIV         426\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nIt was on a still evening in June, that Laura Montreville left her\nfather's cottage, in the little village of Glenalbert, to begin a\nsolitary ramble. Her countenance was mournful, and her step languid; for\nher health had suffered from long confinement, and her spirits were\nexhausted by long attendance on the deathbed of her mother. That labour\nof duty had been lessened by no extrinsic circumstance; for Lady Harriet\nMontreville was a peevish and refractory patient; her disorder had been\ntedious as well as hopeless; and the humble establishment of a half-pay\nofficer furnished no one who could lighten to Laura the burden of\nconstant attendance. But Laura had in herself that which softens all\ndifficulty, and beguiles all fatigue--an active mind, a strong sense of\nduty, and the habit of meeting and of overcoming adverse circumstances.\n\nCaptain Montreville was of a family ancient and respectable, but so far\nfrom affluent, that, at the death of his father, he found his wealth, as\na younger son, to consist only of \u00c2\u00a3500, besides the emoluments arising\nfrom a lieutenancy in a regiment of foot. Nature had given him a fine\nperson and a pleasing address; and to the national opinions of a Scotish\nmother, he was indebted for an education, of which the liberality suited\nbetter with his birth than with his fortunes. He was in London\nnegotiating for the purchase of a company, when he accidentally met with\nLady Harriet Bircham. Her person was shewy, and her manners had the\nglare, even more than the polish of high life. She had a lively\nimagination, and some wit; had read a little, and knew how to shew that\nlittle to advantage. The fine person of Montreville soon awakened the\nonly sort of sensibility of which Lady Harriet was possessed; and her\npreference was sufficiently visible in every step of its progress. To be\ndistinguished by a lady of such rank and attractions, raised in\nMontreville all the vanity of three-and-twenty; and, seen through that\nmedium, Lady Harriet's charms were magnified to perfections. Montreville\nsoon was, or fancied himself, desperately in love. He sued, and was\naccepted with a frankness, to which some stiff advocates for female\ndecorum might give the harsh name of forwardness. Montreville was in\nlove, and he was pleased to call it the candour of a noble mind.\n\nAs his regiment was at this time under orders for the West Indies, Lady\nHarriet prevailed on him to exchange to half-pay; and her fortune being\nno more than \u00c2\u00a35000, economy, no less than the fondness for solitude\nnatural in young men in love, induced him to retire to the country with\nhis bride, who had reasons of her own for wishing to quit London. He had\nbeen educated in Scotland, and he remembered its wild scenery with the\nenthusiasm of a man of taste, and a painter. He settled therefore in the\nvillage of Glenalbert, near Perth; and to relieve his conscience from\nthe load of utter idleness at twenty-three, began the superintendence of\na little farm. Here the ease and vivacity of Lady Harriet made her for a\nwhile the delight of her new acquaintance. She understood all the arts\nof courtesy; and, happy herself, was for a while content to practise\nthem. The store of anecdote, which she had accumulated in her\nintercourse with the great, passed with her country neighbours for\nknowledge of the world. To Scotish ears, the accent of the higher ranks\nof English conveys an idea of smartness, as well as of gentility; and\nLady Harriet became an universal favourite.\n\nThose who succeed best in amusing strangers, are not, it has been\nremarked, the most pleasing in domestic life: they are not even always\nthe most entertaining. Lady Harriet's spirits had ebbs, which commonly\ntook place during her t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aates with Captain Montreville. Outward\nattractions, real or imaginary, are the natural food of passion: but\nsound principles must win confidence, and kindness of heart engage\naffection. Poor Montreville soon gave a mournful assent to these truths;\nfor Lady Harriet had no principles, and her heart was a mere 'pulsation\non the left side.' Her passion for her husband soon declined; and her\nmore permanent appetite for admiration finding but scanty food in a\nsolitary village, her days passed in secret discontent or open\nmurmurings. The narrowness of their finances made her feel the necessity\nof economy, though it could not immediately instruct her in the art of\nit; and Montreville, driven from domestic habits by the turmoil of a\nhousehold, bustling without usefulness, and parsimonious without\nfrugality, was on the point of returning to his profession, or of\nseeking relief in such dissipation as he had the means of obtaining,\nwhen the birth of a daughter gave a new turn to all his hopes and\nwishes.\n\n'I should not wish the girl to be a beauty,' said he to his friend, the\nvillage pastor. 'A pretty face is of no use, but to blind a lover';--and\nhe sighed, as he recollected his own blindness. Yet he was delighted to\nsee that Laura grew every day more lovely. 'Wit only makes women\ntroublesome,' said he;--but before Laura was old enough to shew the\nuncommon acuteness of her understanding, he had quite forgotten that he\never applied the remark to her. To amuse her infancy became his chosen\nrecreation; to instruct her youth was afterwards his favourite\nemployment. Lady Harriet, too, early began to seek food for her vanity\nin the superior endowments of her child, and she forthwith determined\nthat Laura should be a paragon. To perfect her on Nature's plan, never\nentered the head of this judicious matron; she preferred a plan of her\nown, and scorned to be indebted to the assistance of nature, even for\nany part of the perfect structure which she resolved to rear. The temper\nof Laura, uniformly calm and placid, was by nature slightly inclined to\nobstinacy. Lady Harriet had predetermined that her daughter should be a\nmodel of yielding softness. Laura's spirits were inexhaustible; Lady\nHarriet thought nothing so interesting as a pensive beauty. Laura was\nboth a reasonable and a reasoning creature: her mother chose that she\nshould use the latter faculty in every instance, except where maternal\nauthority or opinion was concerned. Innumerable difficulties, therefore,\nopposed Lady Harriet's system; and as violent measures ever occur first\nto those who are destitute of other resources, she had recourse to so\nmany blows, disgraces, and deprivations, as must have effectually ruined\nthe temper and dispositions of her pupil, if Laura had not soon learnt\nto look upon the ungoverned anger of her mother as a disease, to which\nshe owed pity and concealment. This lesson was taught her partly by the\nexample of her father, partly by the admonitions of Mrs Douglas, wife to\nthe clergyman of the parish.\n\nThis lady was in every respect Lady Harriet's opposite. Of sound sense,\nrather than of brilliant abilities; reserved in her manners, gentle in\nher temper, pious, humble, and upright; she spent her life in the\ndiligent and unostentatious discharge of Christian and feminine duty;\nbeloved without effort to engage the love, respected without care to\nsecure the praise of man. She had always treated the little Laura with\nmore than common tenderness; and the child, unused to the fascinations\nof feminine kindness, repaid her attention with the utmost enthusiasm of\nlove and veneration. With her she passed every moment allowed her for\nrecreation; to her she applied in every little difficulty; from her she\nsolicited every childish indulgence. The influence of this excellent\nwoman increased with Laura's age, till her approbation became essential\nto the peace of her young friend, who instinctively sought to read, in\nthe expressive countenance of Mrs Douglas, an opinion of all her words\nand actions. Mrs Douglas, ever watchful for the good of all who\napproached her, used every effort to render this attachment as useful as\nit was delightful, and gradually laid the foundation of the most\nvaluable qualities in the mind of Laura. By degrees she taught her to\nknow and to love the Author of her being, to adore him as the bestower\nof all her innocent pleasures, to seek his favour, or to tremble at his\ndisapprobation in every hour of her life. Lady Harriet had been educated\namong those who despised or neglected the peculiar tenets of the\nChristian faith; she never thought of them, therefore, but as an affair\nthat gave scope to lively argument. On Mrs Douglas's own mind they had\ntheir proper effect; and she convinced Laura that they were not subjects\nfor cavil, but for humble and thankful acceptation.\n\nIn as far as the religious character can be traced to causes merely\nnatural, it may be formed by those who obtain over a mind of sensibility\nand reflection the influence which affection bestows, provided that they\nare themselves duly impressed with the importance, the harmony, the\nexcellence of what they teach. Laura early saw the Christian doctrines,\nprecepts and promises, warm the heart, and guide the conduct, and\nanimate the hopes of her whom she loved best. Sympathy and imitation,\nthe strongest tendencies of infancy, first formed the disposition which\nreason afterwards strengthened into principle, and Laura grew up a pious\nChristian.\n\nIt is the fashion of the age to account for every striking feature of a\ncharacter from education or external circumstance. Those who are fond of\nsuch speculations may trace, if they can, the self-denying habits of\nLaura, to the eagerness with which her enthusiastic mind imbibed the\nstories of self-devoting patriots and martyrs, and may find, in one\nlesson of her preceptress, the tint which coloured her future days. The\nchild had been reading a narrative of the triumphant death of one of the\nfirst reformers, and, full of the emulation which the tale of heroic\nvirtue inspires, exclaimed, her eyes flashing through their tears, her\nlittle form erect with noble daring,--'Let them persecute me and I will\nbe a martyr.' 'You may be so now, to-day, every day,' returned Mrs\nDouglas. 'It was not at the stake that these holy men began their\nself-denial. They had before taken up their cross daily; and whenever,\nfrom a regard to duty, you resign any thing that is pleasing or valuable\nto you, you are for the time a little martyr.'\n\nIn a solitary village, remote from her equals in age and rank, Laura\nnecessarily lived much alone, and in solitude she acquired a grave and\ncontemplative turn of mind. Far from the scenes of dissipation and\nfrivolity, conversant with the grand and the sublime in nature, her\nsentiments assumed a corresponding elevation. She had heard that there\nwas vice in the world: she knew that there was virtue in it; and, little\nacquainted with other minds, deeply studious of her own, she concluded\nthat all mankind were, like herself, engaged in a constant endeavour\nafter excellence; that success in this struggle was at once virtue and\nhappiness, while failure included misery as well as guilt. The habit of\nself-examination, early formed, and steadily maintained, made even\nvenial trespass appear the worst of evils;--while, in the labours of\nduty and the pleasures of devotion, she found joys which sometimes rose\nto rapture.\n\nThe capricious unkindness of her mother gave constant exercise to her\nfortitude and forbearance, while the principle of charity, no less than\nthe feelings of benevolence, led to frequent efforts of self-denial. The\nlatter virtue became daily more necessary, for mismanagement had now\nbrought her mother's fortune almost to a close; and Captain Montreville,\nwhile he felt that she was injuring his child, could not prevail on\nhimself to withhold from Lady Harriet the control of what he considered\nher own, especially as her health was such as to afford a plea for\nindulgence.\n\nLaura had reached her sixteenth year, when Mr Douglas was induced, by a\nlarger benefice, to remove to a parish almost twenty miles distant from\nGlenalbert; and parting with her early friend, was the severest sorrow\nthat Laura had ever yet known. Captain Montreville promised, however,\nthat his daughter should often visit the new parsonage; but Lady\nHarriet's increasing illness long prevented the performance of his\npromise. After a confinement of many months she died, and was lamented\nby her husband, with that sort of sorrow which it usually costs a man to\npart with an object which he is accustomed to see, when he knows that he\nshall see it no more.\n\nIt was on the third evening after her mother's funeral, that Captain\nMontreville prevailed on his daughter to take a solitary walk. Slowly\nshe ascended the hill that overlooked the village, and, stopping near\nits brow, looked back towards the churchyard, to observe a brown hillock\nthat marked the spot where her mother slept. Tears filled her eyes, as,\npassing over long intervals of unkindness, she recollected some casual\nproof of maternal love; and they fell fast as she remembered, that for\nthat love she could now make no return. She turned to proceed;--and the\nmoist eye sparkled with pleasure, the faded cheek glowed with more than\nthe flush of health, when, springing towards her, she beheld the\nelegant, the accomplished, Colonel Hargrave. Forgotten was languor;\nforgotten was sorrow; for Laura was just seventeen, and Colonel Hargrave\nwas the most ardent, the most favoured of lovers. His person was\nsymmetry itself; his manners had all the fascination that vivacity and\nintelligence, joined to the highest polish, can bestow. His love for\nLaura suited with the impetuosity of his character, and for more than a\nyear he had laboured with assiduity and success to inspire a passion\ncorresponding to his own. Yet it was not Hargrave whom Laura loved; for\nthe being on whom she doated had no resemblance to him, but in\nexternals. It was a creature of her own imagination, pure as her own\nheart, yet impassioned as the wildest dreams of fiction,--intensely\nsusceptible of pleasure, and keenly alive to pain, yet ever ready to\nsacrifice the one and to despise the other. This ideal being, clothed\nwith the fine form, and adorned with the insinuating manners, and\nanimated with the infectious love of Hargrave, what heart of woman could\nresist? Laura's was completely captivated.\n\nHargrave, charmed with her consummate loveliness, pleased with her\ncheerful good sense, and fascinated with her matchless simplicity, at\nfirst sought her society without thought but of present gratification,\ntill he was no longer master of himself. He possessed an ample fortune,\nbesides the near prospect of a title; and nothing was farther from his\nthoughts, than to make the poor unknown Laura a sharer in these\nadvantages. But Hargrave was not yet a villain, and he shuddered at the\nthought of seduction. 'I will see her only _once_ more', said he, 'and\nthen tear myself from her for ever.'--'Only this once,' said he, while\nday after day he continued to visit her,--to watch with delight, and to\ncherish with eager solicitude, the tenderness which, amidst her daily\nincreasing reserve, his practised eye could distinguish. The passion\nwhich we do not conquer, will in time reconcile us to any means that\ncan aid its gratification. 'To leave her now would be dishonourable, it\nwould be barbarous,' was his answer to his remonstrating conscience, as\nhe marked the glow of her complexion at his approach, the tremor of her\nhand at his pressure. 'I cannot, indeed, make her my wife. The woman\nwhom I marry, must assist in supporting the rank which she is to fill.\nBut Laura is not made for high life. Short commerce with the world would\ndestroy half her witchery. Love will compensate to us for every\nprivation. I will hide her and myself from a censorious world; she loves\nsolitude; and, with her, solitude will be delightful.'--He forgot that\nsolitude is delightful to the innocent alone.\n\nMeantime, the artless Laura saw, in his highly-coloured pictures of\nhappy love, only scenes of domestic peace and literary leisure; and,\njudging of his feelings by her own, dreamed not of ought that would have\ndisgraced the loves of angels. Tedious weeks of absence had intervened\nsince their last meeting; and Hargrave's resolution was taken. To live\nwithout her was impossible; and he was determined to try whether he had\noverrated the strength of her affection, when he ventured to hope that\nto it she would sacrifice her all. To meet her thus unexpectedly filled\nhim with joy, and the heart of Laura throbbed quick as he expressed his\nrapture. Never had his professions been so ardent; and, softened by\nsorrow and by absence, never had Laura felt such seducing tenderness as\nnow stole upon her. Unable to speak, and unconscious of her path, she\nlistened with silent rapture to the glowing language of her lover, till\nhis entreaties wrung from her a reluctant confession of her preference.\nUnmindful of the feeling of humiliation that makes the moment of such a\nconfession, of all others, the least favourable to a lover's boldness,\nHargrave poured forth the most vehement expressions of passion; while,\nshrinking into herself, Laura now first observed, that the shades of\nevening were closing fast, while their lonely path led through a wood\nthat climbed the rocky hill.--She stopped.--'I must return,' said she,\n'my father will be anxious for me at this hour.'--'Talk not now of\nreturning,' cried Hargrave impetuously, 'trust yourself to a heart that\nadores you. Reward all my lingering pains, and let this happy hour begin\na life of love and rapture.'--Laura, wholly unconscious of his meaning,\nlooked up in his face with an innocent smile. 'I have often taxed you\nwith raving,' said she, 'now, I am sure, you must admit the\ncharge.'--'Do not sport with me loveliest,' cried Hargrave, 'nor waste\nthese precious moments in cold delay. Leave forms to the frozen hearts\nthat wait them, and be from this hour mine, wholly and for ever.' Laura\nthrew a tearful glance on her mourning habit. 'Is this like bridal\nattire?' said she: 'Would you bring your nuptial festivities into the\nhouse of death, and mingle the sound of your marriage vow with my\nmother's dying groans?' Can this simplicity be affected, thought\nHargrave. Is it that she will not understand me? He examined her\ncountenance. All there was candour and unsuspecting love. Her arm rested\non his with confiding pressure, and for a moment Hargrave faltered in\nhis purpose. The next, he imagined that he had gone too far to recede;\nand pressing her to his breast with all the vehemence of passion, he, in\nhurried half-articulate whispers, informed her of his real design. No\nwords can express her feelings, when, the veil thus rudely torn from her\neyes, she saw her pure, her magnanimous Hargrave--the god of her\nidolatry, degraded to a sensualist--a seducer. Casting on him a look of\nmingled horror, dismay, and anguish, she exclaimed, 'Are you so base?'\nand freeing herself, with convulsive struggle, from his grasp, sunk\nwithout sense or motion to the ground.\n\nAs he gazed on the death-pale face of Laura, and raised her lifeless\nform from the earth, compassion, which so often survives principle,\noverpowered all Hargrave's impetuous feelings; and they were succeeded\nby the chill of horror, as the dreadful idea occurred to him, that she\nwas gone for ever. In vain he chafed her cold hands, tried to warm her\nto life in his bosom, bared her's to the evening-breeze, and\ndistractedly called for help; while, with agony, which every moment\nincreased, he remembered, what so lately he had thought of with delight,\nthat no human help was near. No sign of returning life appeared. At last\nhe recollected that, in their walk, they had at some distance crossed a\nlittle stream, and starting up with renovated hope, he ran to it with\nthe speed of lightning; but the way, which was so short as he passed it\nbefore, now seemed lengthened without end. At last he reached it; and\nfilling his hat with water, returned with his utmost speed. He darted\nforward till he found himself at the verge of the wood, and then\nperceived that he had mistaken the path. As he retraced his steps, a\nthousand times he cursed his precipitancy, and wished that he had more\ncautiously ascertained the sentiments of his mistress, ere he permitted\nhis licentious purpose to be seen. After a search, prolonged by his own\nfrantic impatience, he arrived at the spot where he left her;--but no\nLaura was there. He called wildly on her name--he was answered by the\nmountain-echo alone. After seeking her long, a hope arose that she had\nbeen able to reach the village; and thither he determined to return,\nthat, should his hope prove groundless, he might at least procure\nassistance in his search.\n\nAs he approached the little garden that surrounded Captain Montreville's\ncottage, he with joy perceived a light in the window of Laura's\napartment; and never, in the cheerfulest scenes, had he beheld her with\nsuch delight as he did now, when every gesture seemed the expression of\nunutterable anguish. He drew nearer, and saw despair painted on her\nevery feature; and he felt how tender was the love that could thus mourn\nhis degeneracy, and its own blighted hopes. If she could thus feel for\nhis guilt, the thought irresistibly pressed on his mind, with what\nbitterness would she feel her own. Seduction, he perceived, would with\nher be a work of time and difficulty; while, could he determine to make\nher his wife, he was secure of her utmost gratitude and tenderness. The\nknown honour, too, of Captain Montreville made the seduction of his\ndaughter rather a dangerous exploit; and Colonel Hargrave knew, that, in\nspite of the licence of the times, should he destroy the daughter's\nhonour, and the father's life, he would no longer be received, even in\nthe most fashionable circles, with the cordiality he could at present\ncommand. The dignified beauty of Laura would grace a coronet, and more\nthan excuse the weakness which raised her to that distinction:--his wife\nwould be admired and followed, while all her affections would be his\nalone. In fancy he presented her glittering with splendour, or majestic\nin unborrowed loveliness, to his companions; saw the gaze of admiration\nfollow wherever she turned;--and that thought determined him. He would\ngo next morning, and in form commence honourable lover, by laying his\npretensions before Captain Montreville. Should Laura have acquainted her\nfather with the adventures of the evening, he might feel some little\nawkwardness in his first visit; but she might perhaps have kept his\nsecret; and, at all events, his generous intentions would repair his\noffence. Satisfied with himself, he retired to rest, and enjoyed a\nrepose that visited not the pillow of the innocent Laura.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nScarcely had Hargrave quitted Laura, when her senses began to return,\nand with them an indefinite feeling of danger and alarm. The blood\ngushing from her mouth and nostrils, she quickly revived to a full sense\nof her situation, and instinctively endeavoured to quit a spot now so\ndark and lonely. Terror gave her strength to proceed. Every path in her\nnative woods was familiar to her: she darted through them with what\nspeed she could command; and, reckless of all danger but that from which\nshe fled, she leapt from the projecting rocks, or gradually descended\nfrom the more fearful declivities, by clinging to the trees which burst\nfrom the fissures; till, exhausted with fatigue, she reached the valley,\nand entered the garden that surrounded her home. Here, supported no\nlonger by the sense of danger, her spirits utterly failed her; and she\nthrew herself on the ground, without a wish but to die.\n\nFrom this state she was aroused by the voice of her father, who, on the\noutside of the fence, was inquiring of one of the villagers, whether she\nhad been seen. Wishing, she scarcely knew why, to escape all human eyes,\nshe rose, and, without meeting Captain Montreville, gained her own\napartment. As she closed her door, and felt for a moment the sense of\nsecurity, which everyone experiences in the chamber which he calls his\nown,--'Oh!' cried she, 'that I could thus shut out the base world for\never.'\n\nThere was in Laura's chamber one spot, which had, in her eyes, something\nof holy, for it was hallowed by the regular devotions of her life. On\n_it_ she had breathed her first infant prayer. _There_ shone on her the\neastern sun, as she offered her morning tribute of praise. _There_ first\nfell the shades of evening that invited her to implore the protection of\nher God. On that spot she had so often sought consolation, so often\nfound her chief delight, that it was associated in her mind with images\nof hope and comfort; and springing towards it, she now almost\nunconsciously dropped upon her knees. While she poured forth her soul in\nprayer, her anguish softened into resignation; and with the bitter tears\nof disappointment, those of gratitude mingled, while she thanked Him\nwho, though He had visited her with affliction, had preserved her from\nguilt.\n\nShe rose, composed though wretched, resigned though hopeless; and, when\nsummoned to supper, had sufficient recollection to command her voice,\nwhile she excused herself on the plea of a violent head-ache. Left to\nherself, she passed the sleepless night, now in framing excuses for her\nlover, now in tormenting reflections on her mistaken estimate of his\ncharacter; and in bitter regrets that what seemed so excellent should be\nmarred with so foul a stain. But Laura's thoughts were so habitually the\nprelude to action, that, even in the severest conflict of her powers,\nshe was not likely to remain long in a state of ineffective meditation.\n'What ought I _now_ to do,' was a question which, from childhood, Laura\nhad every hour habitually asked herself; and the irresistible force of\nthe habit of many years, brought the same question to her mind when she\nrose with the dawn.\n\nWith a heavy heart, she was obliged to confess, that delicacy, no less\nthan prudence, must forbid all future intercourse with Hargrave. But he\nhad for some time been a constant visitor at the cottage, till excluded\nby the increasing illness of Lady Harriet. He might now renew his\nvisits, and how was it possible to prevent this? Should she now refuse\nto see him, her father must be made acquainted with the cause of such a\nrefusal, and she could not doubt that the consequences would be such as\nshe shuddered to think of. She groaned aloud as the horrid possibility\noccurred to her, that her father might avenge her wrongs at the expense\nof his virtue and his life--become for her sake a murderer, or fall by a\nmurderer's hand. She instantly resolved to conceal for ever the insult\nshe had received; and to this resolution she determined that all other\ncircumstances should bend. Yet should she receive Colonel Hargrave as\nformerly, what might he not have the audacity to infer? How could she\nmake him fully sensible of her indignant feelings, yet act such a part\nas might deceive the penetration of her father? Act a part!--deceive her\nfather! Laura's thoughts were usually clear and distinct; and there was\nsomething in this distinct idea of evasions and deceit, that sickened\nher very soul. This was the first system of concealment that had ever\ndarkened her fair and candid mind; and she wept bitterly when she\nconvinced herself, that from such conduct there was no escape.\n\nShe sat lost in these distressing reflections, till the clock struck the\nhour of breakfast; then recollecting that she must not suffer her\nappearance to betray her, she ran to her glass, and, with more interest\nthan she had perhaps ever before felt in the employment, proceeded to\ndress her countenance to advantage. She bathed her swollen eyes, shaded\nthem with the natural ringlets of her dark hair, rubbed her wan cheeks\ntill their colour returned, and then entered the parlour with an\noveracted gaiety that surprised Captain Montreville. 'I scarcely\nexpected,' said he, 'to see you so very animated, after being so ill as\nto go to rest last night, for the first time in your life, without your\nfather's blessing.'\n\nLaura, instantly sensible of her mistake, colouring, stammered something\nof the cheering influence of the morning air; and then meditating on a\nproper medium in her demeanour, sunk into so long a silence, as Captain\nMontreville could not have failed to remark, had not his attention been\ndiverted by the arrival of the newspaper, which he continued to study\ntill breakfast was ended, when Laura gladly retired to her room.\n\nThough the understanding of Laura was above her years, she had not\nescaped a mistake common to the youth of both sexes, when smarting under\na recent disappointment in love,--the mistake of supposing, that all the\ninterest of life is, with respect to them, at an end, and that their\ndays must thenceforth bring only a dull routine of duties without\nincitement, and of toils without hope. But the leading principle of\nLaura's life was capable of giving usefulness, and almost\nrespectability, even to her errors; and the gloom of the wilderness,\nthrough which her path seemed to lie, only brightened, by contrast, the\nsplendour that lay beyond. 'The world,' thought she, 'has now nothing to\noffer that I covet, and little to threaten that I fear. What then\nremains but to do my duty, unawed by its threatenings, unbribed by its\njoys. Ere this cloud darkened all my earthly prospects, I was not\nuntaught, though I had too much forgotten the lesson, that it was not\nfor pastime I was sent hither. I am here as a soldier, who strives in an\nenemy's land; as one who must run--must wrestle--must strain every\nnerve--exert every power, nor once shrink from the struggle till the\nprize is my own. Nor do I live for myself alone. I have a friend to\ngratify--the poor to relieve--the sorrowful to console--a father's age\nto comfort--a God to serve. And shall selfish feeling disincline me to\nsuch duties as these? No, with more than seeming cheerfulness, I will\nperform them all. I will thank Heaven for exempting me from the far\nheavier task of honouring and obeying a profligate.'\n\nA profligate! Must she apply such a name to Hargrave. The enthusiasm of\nthe moment expired at the word, and the glow of virtuous resolution\nfaded to the paleness of despondency and pain.\n\nFrom a long and melancholy reverie, Laura was awakened by the sound of\nthe garden gate, and she perceived that it was entered by Colonel\nHargrave. Instinctively she was retreating from the window, when she saw\nhim joined by her father; and, trembling lest candour was about to\nconfess, or inadvertence to betray, what she so much wished to conceal,\nshe continued with breathless anxiety to watch their conference.\n\nThough Colonel Hargrave was certainly one of the best bred men in the\nkingdom, and, of consequence, entirely divested of the awkwardness of\n_mauvaise honte_, it must be confessed, that he entered the presence of\nthe father of Laura with rather less than his accustomed ease; but the\ncordial salutation of Captain Montreville banishing all fear that the\nlady had been too communicative, our lover proceeded, without any\nremaining embarrassment, to unfold the purpose of his visit. Nor could\nany one have conjectured, from the courtly condescension of the great\nman, that he conceived he was bestowing a benefit; nor from the manly\nfrankness of the other, that he considered himself as receiving a\nfavour. Not but that the Colonel was in full possession of the pleasures\nof conscious generosity and condescension. So complete, indeed, was his\nself-approbation, that he doubted not but his present magnanimous\nresolve would efface from the mind of Laura all resentment for his\noffence. Her displeasure he thought would be very short lived, if he\nwere able to convince her that his fault was not premeditated. This he\nconceived to be an ample excuse, because he chose to consider the insult\nhe had offered, apart from the base propensities, the unbridled\nselfishness which it indicated. As Laura had so well concealed his\nindiscretion, he was too good a politician himself to expose it; and he\nproceeded to make such offers in regard to settlements, as suited the\nliberality of his character.\n\nCaptain Montreville listened with undisguised satisfaction to proposals\napparently so advantageous to his beloved child; but, while he\nexpressed his entire approbation of the Colonel's suit, regard to\nfeminine decorum made him add, 'that he was determined to put no\nconstraint on the inclinations of his daughter.' The Colonel felt a\nstrong conviction, that no constraint would be necessary: nevertheless,\nturning a neat period, importing his willingness to resign his love,\nrather than interfere with the happiness of Miss Montreville, he closed\nthe conference, by entreating that the Captain would give him an\nimmediate opportunity of learning his fate from the lips of the fair\nLaura herself.\n\nLaura had continued to follow them with her eyes, till they entered the\nhouse together; and the next minute Captain Montreville knocked at her\ndoor.\n\n'If your head-ache is not quite gone,' said he, with a significant\nsmile, 'I will venture to recommend a physician. Colonel Hargrave is\nwaiting to prescribe for you; and you may repay him in kind, for he\ntells me he has a case for your consideration.'\n\nLaura was on the point of protesting against any communication with\nColonel Hargrave; but instantly recollecting the explanation that would\nbe necessary, 'I will go to him this instant,' she exclaimed with an\neagerness that astonished her father.\n\n'Surely, you will first smooth these reddish locks of yours,' said he,\nfondly stroaking his hand over her dark auburn hair. 'I fear so much\nhaste may make the Colonel vain.'\n\nLaura coloured violently; for, amidst all her fears of a discovery, she\nfound place for a strong feeling of resentment, at the easy security of\nforgiveness that seemed intimated by a visit so immediately succeeding\nthe offence. Having employed the few moments she passed at her toilette\nin collecting her thoughts, she descended to the parlour, fully resolved\nto give no countenance to the hopes her lover might have built on her\nsupposed weakness.\n\nThe Colonel was alone; and as she opened the door, eagerly advanced\ntowards her. 'My adored Laura,' cried he, 'this condescension--.' Had he\nstaid to read the pale, but resolute countenance of his 'adored' Laura,\nhe would have spared his thanks for her condescension.\n\nShe interrupted him. 'Colonel Hargrave,' said she, with imposing\nseriousness, 'I have a request to make to you. Perhaps the peace of my\nlife depends upon your compliance.'\n\n'Ah, Laura! what request can I refuse, where I have so much to ask?'\n\n'Promise me, that you will never make known to my father--that you will\ntake every means to conceal from him the--,' she hesitated, 'the--our\nmeeting last night,' she added, rejoiced to have found a palliative\nexpression for her meaning.\n\n'Oh! dearest Laura! forget it;--think of it no more.'\n\n'Promise--promise solemnly. If indeed,' added she shuddering, while an\nexpression of anguish crossed her features, 'if indeed promises can\nweigh with such a one as you.'\n\n'For pity's sake, speak not such cutting words as those.'\n\n'Colonel Hargrave, will you give me your promise?'\n\n'I do promise--solemnly promise. Say, but that you forgive me.'\n\n'I thank you, Sir, for so far ensuring the safety of my father, since he\nmight have risked his life to avenge the wrongs of his child. You cannot\nbe surprised, if I now wish to close our acquaintance, as speedily as\nmay be consistent with the concealment so unfortunately necessary.'\n\nImpatient to conclude an interview which tasked her fortitude to the\nutmost, Laura was about to retire. Hargrave seized her hand. 'Surely,\nLaura, you will not leave me thus. You cannot refuse forgiveness to a\nfault caused by intemperate passion alone. The only atonement in my\npower, I now come to offer: my hand--my fortune--my future rank.'\n\nThe native spirit, and wounded delicacy of Laura, flashed from her eyes,\nwhile she replied: 'I fear, Sir, I shall not be suitably grateful for\nyour generosity, while I recollect the alternative you would have\npreferred.'\n\nThis was the first time that Laura had ever appeared to her lover, other\nthan the tender, the timid girl. From this character she seemed to have\nstarted at once into the high-spirited, the dignified woman; and, with a\ntruly masculine passion for variety, Hargrave thought he had never seen\nher half so fascinating. 'My angelic Laura,' cried he, as he knelt\nbefore her, 'lovelier in your cruelty, suffer me to prove to you my\nrepentance--my reverence--my adoration;--suffer me to prove them to the\nworld, by uniting our fates for ever.'\n\n'It is fit the guilty should kneel,' said Laura, turning away, 'but not\nto their fellow mortals. Rise, Sir, this homage to me is but mockery.'\n\n'Say, then, that you forgive me; say, that you will accept the\ntenderness, the duty of my future life.'\n\n'What! rather than control your passions, will you now stoop to receive\nas your wife, her whom so lately you thought vile enough for the lowest\ndegradation? Impossible! yours I can never be. Our views, our\nprinciples, are opposite as light and darkness. How shall I call heaven\nto witness the prostitution of its own ordinances? How shall I ask the\nblessing of my Maker, on my union with a being at enmity with him?'\n\n'Good heavens, Laura, will you sacrifice to a punctilio--to a fit of\nCalvinistic enthusiasm, the peace of my life, the peace of your own? You\nhave owned that you love me--I have seen it--delighted seen it a\nthousand times--and will you now desert me for ever?'\n\n'I do not act upon punctilio,' returned Laura calmly;--'I believe I am\nno enthusiast. What _have_ been my sentiments, is now of no importance;\nto unite myself with vice would be deliberate wickedness--to hope for\nhappiness from such an union would be desperate folly.'\n\n'Dearest Laura, bound by your charms, allured by your example, my\nreformation would be certain, my virtue secure.'\n\n'Oh, hope it not!--Familiar with my form, my only hold on your regard,\nyou would neglect, forsake, despise me; and who should say that my\npunishment was not just.'\n\n'And will you then,' cried Hargrave, in an agony; 'Will you then cut me\noff forever? Will you drive me for ever from your heart?'\n\n'I have now no choice--leave me--forget me--seek some woman less\nfastidious; or rather endeavour, by your virtues, to deserve one\nsuperior far. Then honoured, beloved, as a husband, as a father'--The\nfortitude of Laura failed before the picture of her fancy, and she was\nunable to proceed. Determined to conceal her weakness from Hargrave, she\nbroke from him, and hurried towards the door;--but, melting into\ntenderness at the thought that this interview was perhaps the last, she\nturned. 'Oh, Hargrave,' she cried, clasping her hands as in\nsupplication, 'have pity on yourself--have pity on me--forsake the fatal\npath on which you have entered, that, though for ever torn from you\nhere, I may yet meet you in a better world.'\n\nShe then darted from the room, leaving her lover in dumb amazement, at\nthe conclusion of an interview so different from his expectations. For\nthe resentment of Laura he had been prepared; but upon her determined\nrefusal, he had never calculated, and scarcely could he now admit the\nreality. Could he give her credit for the professed motive of her\nrejection? Colonel Hargrave had nothing in himself that made it natural\nfor him to suppose passion sacrificed to reason and principle. Had he\nthen deceived himself,--had she never really loved him?--the suggestion\nwas too mortifying to be admitted. Had resentment given rise to her\ndetermination? She had spoken from the first with calmness,--at last\nwith tenderness. Was all this but a scene of coquetry, designed to\nenhance her favours? The simple, the noble, the candid Laura guilty of\ncoquetry?--impossible! While these thoughts darted with confused\nrapidity through his mind, one idea alone was distinct and\npermanent--Laura had rejected him. This thought was torture. Strong\nresentment mingled with his anguish; and to inflict, on the innocent\ncause of it, pangs answering to those he felt, would have afforded to\nHargrave the highest gratification. Though his passion for Laura was the\nmost ardent of which he was capable, its effects, for the present, more\nresembled those of the bitterest hatred. That she loved him, he would\nnot allow himself to doubt; and, therefore, he concluded that neglect\nwould inflict the surest, as well as the most painful wound. Swearing\nthat he would make her feel it at her heart's core, he left the cottage,\nstrode to the village inn, surlily ordered his horses, and, in a humour\ncompounded of revenge, impatient passion, and wounded pride, returned to\nhis quarters at ----. His scheme of revenge had all the success that\nsuch schemes usually have or deserve; and while, for one whole week, he\ndeigned not, by visit or letter, to notice his mistress, the real\nsuffering which he inflicted, did not exactly fall on her for whom he\nintended the pain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nTo an interview which he presumed would be as delightful as interesting,\nCaptain Montreville chose to give no interruption; and therefore he had\nwalked out to superintend his hay-making: But, after staying abroad for\ntwo hours, which he judged a reasonable length for a t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate, he\nreturned, and was a little surprised to find that the Colonel was gone.\nThough he entertained not a doubt of the issue of the conference, he had\nsome curiosity to know the particulars, and summoned Laura to\ncommunicate them.\n\n'Well, my love,' said he, as the conscious Laura shut the parlour door,\n'is Colonel Hargrave gone?'\n\n'Long ago, Sir.'\n\n'I thought he would have waited my return.'\n\nLaura made no answer.\n\n'When are we to see him again?'\n\nLaura did not know.\n\n'Well, well,' said Captain Montreville, a little impatiently, 'since the\nColonel is gone without talking to me, I must just hear from you what it\nis you have both determined on.'\n\nLaura trembled in every limb. 'I knew,' said she, without venturing to\nlift her eye, 'that you would never sacrifice your child to rank or\nfortune; and therefore I had no hesitation in refusing Colonel\nHargrave.'\n\nCaptain Montreville started back with astonishment,--'Refuse Colonel\nHargrave?' cried he,--'Impossible--you cannot be in earnest.'\n\nLaura, with much truth, assured him that she never in her life had been\nmore serious.\n\nCaptain Montreville was thunderstruck. Surprise for a few moments kept\nhim silent. At last recovering himself,--'Why, Laura,' said he, 'what\nobjection could you possibly make to Hargrave?--he is young, handsome,\naccomplished, and has shewn such generosity in his choice of you'--\n\n'Generosity! Sir,' repeated Laura.\n\n'Yes; it was generous in Colonel Hargrave, who might pretend to the\nfirst woman in the kingdom, to think of offering to share his fortune\nand his rank with you, who have neither.'\n\nLaura's sentiments on this subject did not exactly coincide with her\nfather's, but she remained silent while he continued: 'I think I have a\nright to hear your objections, for I am entirely at a loss to guess\nthem. I don't indeed know a fault Hargrave has, except perhaps a few\ngallantries; which most girls of your age think a very pardonable\nerror.'\n\nA sickness, as of death, seized Laura; but she answered steadily,\n'Indeed, Sir, the Colonel's views are so different from mine--his\ndispositions so very unlike--so opposite, that nothing but unhappiness\ncould possibly result from such an union. But,' added she, forcing a\nlanguid smile, 'we shall, if you please, discuss all this to-morrow;\nfor, indeed, today, I am unable to defend my own case with you. I have\nbeen indisposed all day.'\n\nCaptain Montreville looked at Laura, and, in the alarm which her unusual\npaleness excited, lost all sense of the disappointment she had just\ncaused him. He threw his arm tenderly round her--supported her to her\nown apartment--begged she would try to rest,--ran to seek a cordial for\nhis darling; and then, fearing that the dread of his displeasure should\nadd to her disorder, hastened back to assure her that, though her\nhappiness was his dearest concern, he never meant to interfere with her\njudgment of the means by which it was to be promoted.\n\nTears of affectionate gratitude burst from the eyes of Laura. 'My dear\nkind father,' she cried, 'let me love--let me please you--and I ask no\nother earthly happiness.'\n\nCaptain Montreville then left her to rest; and, quite exhausted with\nillness, fatigue, and sorrow, she slept soundly for many hours.\n\nThe Captain spent most of the evening ruminating on the occurrence of\nthe day; nor did his meditations at all diminish his surprize at his\ndaughter's unaccountable rejection of his favourite. He recollected many\ninstances in which he thought he had perceived her partiality to the\nColonel;--he perplexed himself in vain to reconcile them with her\npresent behaviour. He was compelled at last to defer his conclusions\ntill Laura herself should solve the difficulty. The subject was, indeed,\nso vexatious to him, that he longed to have his curiosity satisfied, in\norder finally to dismiss the affair from his mind.\n\nLaura had long been accustomed, when assailed by any adverse\ncircumstance, whether more trivial or more important, to seize the first\nopportunity of calmly considering how far she had herself contributed to\nthe disaster; and, as nothing is more hostile to good humour than an\nill-defined feeling of self-reproach, the habit was no less useful to\nthe regulation of our heroine's temper, than to her improvement in the\nrarer virtues of prudence and candour. Her first waking hour, except\nthat which was uniformly dedicated to a more sacred purpose, she now\nemployed in strict and impartial self-examination. She endeavoured to\ncall to mind every part of her behaviour to Colonel Hargrave, lest her\nown conduct might have seemed to countenance his presumption. But in\nvain. She could not recall a word, a look, even a thought, that could\nhave encouraged his profligacy. 'Yet why should I wonder,' she\nexclaimed, 'if he expected that temptation might seduce, or weakness\nbetray me, since he knew me fallible, and of the Power by which I am\nupheld he thought not.'\n\nSatisfied of the purity of her conduct, she next proceeded to examine\nits prudence: but here she found little reason for self-congratulation.\nHer conscience, indeed, completely acquitted her of levity or\nforwardness, but its charges of imprudence she could not so easily\nparry. Why had she admitted a preference for a man whose moral character\nwas so little known to her? Where slept her discretion, while she\nsuffered that preference to strengthen into passion? Why had she\nindulged in dreams of ideal perfection? Why had she looked for\nconsistent virtue in a breast where she had not ascertained that piety\nresided? Had she allowed herself time for consideration, would she have\nforgotten that religion was the only foundation strong enough to support\nthe self-denying, the purifying virtues? These prudent reflections came,\nin part, too late; for to love, Laura was persuaded she must henceforth\nbe a stranger. But to her friendships, she conceived, that they might be\napplicable; and she determined to make them useful in her future\nintercourse with her own sex; to whom, perhaps, they may be applied even\nwith more justice than to the other.\n\nThe mind of Laura had been early stored with just and rational\nsentiments. These were the bullion--but it was necessary that\nexperience should give the stamp that was to make them current in the\nordinary business of life. Had she called prudence to her aid, in the\nfirst stage of her acquaintance with the insinuating Hargrave, what\nanguish would she not have spared herself. But if the higher wisdom is\nto foresee and prevent misfortune, the next degree is to make the best\nof it when unavoidable; and Laura resolved that this praise at least\nshould be her's. Fortified by this resolution, she quitted her\napartment, busied herself in her domestic affairs, met her father almost\nwith cheerfulness; and, when he renewed the subject of their last\nconversation, repeated, with such composure, her conviction of the\ndissimilarity of Hargrave's dispositions to her own, that Captain\nMontreville began to believe that he had been mistaken in his opinion of\nher preference. Still, however, he could not account for her rejection\nof an offer so unobjectionable; and he hinted a suspicion, that some of\nHargrave's gallantries had been repeated to her, and perhaps with\nexaggeration. With trembling lips, Laura assured him she had never heard\nthe slightest insinuation against Colonel Hargrave. Though Laura had\nlittle of romance in her composition, her father now began to imagine,\nthat she allowed herself to cherish the romantic dream, that sympathy of\nsouls, and exactly concordant tastes and propensities, were necessary to\nthe happiness of wedded life. But Laura calmly declared, that her tastes\nwere not inflexible; and that, had she intended to marry, she should\nhave found it an easy duty to conform them to those of her husband: but\nthat the thought of marriage was shocking to her, and she trusted no man\nwould ever again think of her as a wife. Montreville, who for once\nsuspected his daughter of a little affectation, made no effort to combat\nthis unnatural antipathy, but trusted to time and nature for its cure.\n\nAs soon as her father left her, Laura, determined not to be brave by\nhalves, began the painful task of destroying every relic of Hargrave's\npresence. She banished from her port-folio the designs he had made for\nher drawings, destroyed the music from which he had accompanied her, and\neffaced from her books the marks of his pencil. She had amused her\nsolitary hours by drawing, in chalks, a portrait of features indelibly\nengraven on her recollection, and her fortitude failed her when about to\nconsign it to the flames.--'No;' she exclaimed, 'I can never part with\nthis. This, at least, I may love unreproved,' and she pressed it in\nagony to her heart--inwardly vowing that no human being should fill its\nplace. But such thoughts as these could not linger in the reasonable\nmind of Laura. The next moment she blushed for her weakness; and,\ncasting away its last treasure, averted her eyes till the flames had\nconsumed it to ashes. 'Now all is over,' she cried, as she threw herself\ninto a chair and burst into tears. But, quickly wiping them away, she\nresolved that she would not wilfully bind herself to the rack of\nrecollection, and hastened to exert herself in some of her ordinary\nemployments.\n\nLaura was aware that the cottage, where every walk, every shrub, every\nflower spoke of Hargrave, was a scene unlikely to aid her purpose of\nforgetting him; and, therefore, she that evening proposed to her father\nthat they should pay their long promised visit to Mrs Douglas. He\nreadily consented. Their journey was fixed for the following day, and\nLaura occupied herself in preparing for their departure, though with\nfeelings far different from the delight with which, a few days before,\nshe would have anticipated a meeting with her early friend.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nMrs Douglas observed, with satisfaction, the improved stature and\nincreasing gracefulness of her young favourite; but she remarked, with\npainful interest, that the hectic of pleasure which tinged the cheek of\nLaura, at their meeting, faded fast to the hue of almost sickly\ndelicacy. She soon noticed that an expression, as of sudden torture,\nwould sometimes contract, for a moment, the polished forehead of Laura;\nthat it was now succeeded by the smothered sigh, the compressed lip, the\nhasty motion that spoke of strong mental effort, now subsided into the\nlanguor of deep unconquered melancholy. Such depression Mrs Douglas\ncould not attribute to the loss of a mother, whose treatment furnished\nmore occasions of patience than of gratitude; and she anxiously longed\nto discover its real cause. But it was soon evident that this was a\nsecret which Laura had no intention to disclose. A glance from the\ninquiring eye of Mrs Douglas, at once recalled her to constrained\ncheerfulness; and the presence of Captain Montreville seemed always to\nput her entirely upon her guard. While he was in the room, she talked,\nread aloud, or played with the children, as if determined to be amused;\nbut as soon as he retired, she relapsed, like one wearied with effort,\ninto languor and melancholy, till recalled to herself by the\nscrutinizing looks of Mrs Douglas. Even in their most private\nconversations, the name of Hargrave never passed her lips. Months,\nindeed, had elapsed since Laura could have pronounced that name without\npainful emotion--to utter it now was become almost impossible. She felt\nthat she had no right to publish, while she rejected, his addresses; and\nshe felt an invincible repugnance to expose even his failings, but much\nmore his vices, to the censure of the respectable Mrs Douglas. Soon\nafter she first saw Hargrave, she had written to her friend a warm\neulogium of his fine person, captivating manners, and elegant\naccomplishments. Mrs Douglas, in reply, had desired to hear more of this\nphoenix; but before Laura again found leisure to write, she was no\nlonger inclined to make Hargrave her subject, and her friend had\ndesisted from fruitless inquiries. Mrs Douglas had lately had an\nopportunity of judging for herself of the Colonel's attractions; and, so\ngreat did they appear to her, that it was with extreme astonishment she\nheard his late disappointment from Captain Montreville, who did not feel\nhis daughter's delicacy on the subject. This communication only served\nto increase her perplexity as to the cause of Laura's depression; yet\nshe felt herself relieved from the apprehension, that hopeless love for\nHargrave was wasting the health and peace of her dear Laura. Still,\nhowever, she continued to watch that expressive countenance, to weigh\nevery word that might tend to unfold the enigma. In vain;--Laura\nstudiously avoided all approach to an explanation. Mrs Douglas's anxiety\nnow increased to a painful extreme. She felt how necessary to female\ninexperience is the advice of a female,--how indispensable to feminine\nsorrows are the consolations of feminine sympathy; and she resolved that\nno false delicacy should withhold her from offering such relief as she\nmight have power to bestow.\n\nOne morning, after the gentlemen had left them alone together, Mrs\nDouglas, meditating on the best means of introducing the subject she had\nso much at heart, had fallen into a long silence; when, looking up, she\nperceived that Laura had let fall her work, and was sitting with her\neyes fixed, and her arms dropped, in the attitude of one whose thoughts\nhad no connection with present objects. At the heavy sigh with which Mrs\nDouglas surveyed her, she started, and was rousing her attention to some\nindifferent subject, when Mrs Douglas, kindly taking her hand, said, 'My\ndear child, whatever may be necessary with others, I beseech you to be\nunder no constraint with me. I am far from wishing to intrude into your\nconfidence, but do not add the pain of constraint to anguish that\nalready seems so oppressive.'\n\nLarge tears stole from under Laura's downcast eyelids; but she spoke\nnot. Mrs Douglas continued--'If my best advice, my most affectionate\nsympathy, can be of use to you, I need not say you may command them.'\n\nLaura threw herself into the arms of her friend, and for some moments\nsobbed with uncontrolled emotion; but soon composing herself, she\nreplied: 'If advice could have profited, if consolation could have\nreached me, where should I have sought them unless from you, respected\nfriend of my youth;--but the warning voice of wisdom comes now too late,\nand even your sympathy would be bestowed in vain.'\n\n'Heaven forbid that my dearest Laura should be beyond the reach of\ncomfort. That is the lot of guilt alone.'\n\n'I am grateful to Heaven,' said Laura, 'that I have been less guilty\nthan imprudent. But, my best friend, let us quit this subject. This\nwretchedness cannot, shall not last. Only let me implore you not to\nnotice it to my father. You know not what horrors might be the\nconsequence.'\n\nMrs Douglas shook her head. 'Ah! Laura,' said she, 'that path is not the\npath of safety in which you would elude a father's eye.' Laura's glance\nmet that of her friend; and she read suspicion there. The thought was so\npainful to her, that she was on the point of disclosing all; but she\nremembered that the reasons which had at first determined her to\nsilence, were not altered by any one's suspicions, and she restrained\nherself. Colonel Hargrave had cruelly wronged and insulted her--she\nought therefore to be doubly cautious how she injured him. Sympathy, in\nher case, she felt, would be a dangerous indulgence; and, above all, she\nshrunk with horror from exposing her lover, or his actions, to\ndetestation or contempt. 'Perhaps the time may come,' said she, pursuing\nher reflections aloud, 'when you will be convinced that I am incapable\nof any clandestine purpose. At present your compassion might be a\ntreacherous balm to me, when my best wisdom must be to forget that I\nhave need of pity.'\n\nMrs Douglas looked on the open candid countenance of Laura, and her\nsuspicions vanished in a moment; but they returned when her young friend\nreiterated her intreaties that she would not hint the subject to her\nfather. Laura was, however, fortified in her resolutions of concealment,\nby an opinion she had often heard Mrs Douglas express, that the feelings\nof disappointed love should by women be kept inviolably a secret. She\nwas decisively giving a new turn to the conversation, when it was\ninterrupted by the entrance of the gentlemen; and Mrs Douglas, a little\nhurt at the steadiness of her young friend, more than half determined to\nrenew the subject no more.\n\nA letter lay on the table, which the post had brought for Captain\nMontreville; he read it with visible uneasiness, and immediately left\nthe room. Laura perceived his emotion; and, ever alive to the painful\nsubject nearest her heart, instantly concluded that the letter brought a\nconfession from Hargrave. She heard her father's disordered steps pacing\nthe apartment above, and earnestly longed, yet feared to join him.\nAnxiety at length prevailed; and she timidly approached the door of\nCaptain Montreville's chamber. She laid her hand upon the lock; paused\nagain, with failing courage, and was about to retire, when her father\nopened the door. 'Come in, my love,' said he, 'I wish to speak with\nyou.' Laura, trembling, followed him into the room. 'I find,' said he,\n'we must shorten our visit to our kind friends here, and travel\nhomewards, I must prepare,' continued he, and he sighed heavily, 'I must\nprepare for a much longer journey.'\n\nLaura's imagination took the alarm; and, forgetting how unlikely it was\nthat Captain Montreville should disclose such a resolution to her, she\nthought only of his intending to prepare for a journey whence there is\nno return, before he should stake his life against that of Hargrave. She\nhad not power to speak; but, laying her hand on her father's arm, she\ncast on him a look of imploring agony. 'Do not be alarmed, my love,'\nsaid he: 'I shall, in a few days, convey your commands to London; but I\ndo not mean to be long absent.'\n\nLaura's heart leapt light. 'To London, Sir?' said she, in a tone of\ncheerful inquiry.\n\n'Yes, my dear child; I must go, and leave you alone at home--while yet I\nhave a home to shelter you. Had you resembled any other girl of your\nage, I should have said no more of this--but I will have no concealments\nfrom you. Read this letter.'\n\nIt was from Captain Montreville's agent, and briefly stated, that the\nmerchant in whose hands he had lately vested his all, in an annuity on\nhis daughter's life, was dead; and that, owing to some informality in\nthe deed, the heirs refused to make any payment. Having read the letter,\nLaura continued for some moments to muse on its contents, with her eyes\nvacantly fixed on the civil expression of concern with which it\nconcluded. 'How merciful it is,' she exclaimed, 'that this blow fell not\ntill my mother was insensible of the stroke.'\n\n'For myself,' said Captain Montreville, 'I think I could have borne it\nwell; but this was the little independence I thought I had secured for\nyou, dear darling of my heart; and now'--The father's lip quivered, and\nhis eyes filled; but he turned aside, for he could _be_ tender--but\nwould not _seem_ so.\n\n'Dearest father,' said Laura, 'think not of me. Could you have given me\nmillions, I should still have been dependent on the care of Providence,\neven for my daily bread. My dependence will now only be a little more\nperceptible. But perhaps,' added she cheerfully, 'something may be done\nto repair this disaster, Warren's heirs will undoubtedly rectify this\nmistake, when they find it has been merely accidental. At all events, a\njourney to London will amuse you; and I shall manage your harvest so\nactively in your absence.'\n\nCaptain Montreville had, from Laura's infancy, been accustomed to\nwitness instances of her fortitude, to see her firm under unmerited and\nmerciless chastisement, and patient under intense bodily suffering--but\nher composure on this occasion, so far surpassed his expectations, that\nhe was inclined to attribute it less to fortitude than to\ninconsideration. 'How light-hearted is youth,' thought he, as he quitted\nher. 'This poor child has never seen the harsh features of poverty, but\nwhen distance softened their deformity, and she now beholds his approach\nwithout alarm.' He was mistaken. Laura had often taken a near survey of\npoverty. She had entered the cabins of the very poor--seen infancy\nsqualid, and youth spiritless--manhood exhausted by toil, and age pining\nwithout comfort. In fancy she had substituted herself in the place of\nthese victims of want; felt by sympathy their varieties of wretchedness;\nand she justly considered poverty among the heaviest of human\ncalamities. But she was sensible that her firmness might support her\nfather's spirits, or her weakness serve to aggravate his distress; and\nshe wisely pushed aside the more formidable mischief, which she could\nnot surmount, to attend to the more immediate evil, which she felt it in\nher power to alleviate.\n\nThe moment she was alone, Laura fell on her knees: 'Oh! Heavenly\nProvidence,' she cried, 'save, if it be thy will, my dear father's age\nfrom poverty, though, like my great Master, I should not have where to\nlay my head.' She continued to pray long and fervently, for spirits to\ncheer her father under his misfortune; and for fortitude to endure her\nown peculiar sorrow, in her estimation so much more bitter. Having\nimplored the blessing of Heaven on her exertions, she next began to\npractice them. She wandered out to court the exhilarating influence of\nthe mountain air; and, studiously turning her attention to all that was\ngay, sought to rouse her spirits for the task she had assigned them. She\nwas so successful, that she was that evening the life of the little\nfriendly circle. She talked, sang, and recited--she exerted all the wit\nand vivacity of which she was mistress--she employed powers of humour\nwhich she herself had scarcely been conscious of possessing. Her gaiety\nsoon became contagious. Scarcely a trace appeared of the anxious fears\nof Mrs Douglas, or the parental uneasiness of Captain Montreville, and\nfewer still of the death-stroke which disappointed confidence had\ncarried to the peace of poor Laura. But, retired to the solitude of her\nchamber, her exhausted spirits found relief in tears. She felt, that\nlong to continue her exertion would be impossible; and, in spite of\nreason, which told of the danger of solitude, anticipated, with\npleasure, the moment when total seclusion should leave her free to\nundisguised wretchedness.\n\nLaura was not yet, however, destined to the hopeless task of combating\nmisplaced affection in entire seclusion. On the following morning she\nfound a stranger at the breakfast-table. He seemed a man of information\nand accomplishments. An enthusiast in landscape, he was come to\nprosecute his favourite study amidst the picturesque magnificence of\nHighland scenery; and the appearance and manners of a gentleman,\nfurnished him with a sufficient introduction to Highland hospitality.\nRelieved, by his presence, from the task of entertaining, Laura scarcely\nlistened to the conversation, till the stranger, having risen from\ntable, began to examine a picture which occupied a distinguished place\nin Mrs Douglas's parlour. It was the work of Laura, who was no mean\nproficient. She had early discovered what is called a genius for\npainting; that is to say, she had exercised much of her native\ninvention, and habitual industry on the art. Captain Montreville added\nto his personal instructions, every facility which it was in his power\nto bestow. Even when her performances had little in them of wonderful\nbut their number, her acquaintance pronounced them wonderful; and they\nobtained the more useful approbation of a neighbouring nobleman, who\ninvited her to use, as copies, any part of his excellent collection. Her\nprogress was now, indeed, marvellous to those who were new to the\neffects of unremitting industry, guided by models of exquisite skill.\nHaving long and sedulously copied, from pieces of acknowledged merit,\nshe next attempted an original; and having, with great care composed,\nand with incredible labour finished her design, she dedicated to Mrs\nDouglas the first fruits of her improved talents, in the picture which\nthe stranger was now contemplating. Willing that her young friend should\nreap advantage from the criticisms of a judicious artist, Mrs Douglas\nencouraged him to speak freely of the beauties and defects of the piece.\nAfter remarking that there was some skill in the composition, much\ninterest in the principal figure, and considerable freedom in the\ntouch, he added: 'If this be, as I suppose, the work of a young artist,\nI shall not be surprised that he one day rise both to fame and fortune.'\n\nMrs Douglas was about to direct his praise to its rightful owner, but\nLaura silenced her by a look. The stranger's last expression had excited\nan interest which no other earthly subject could have awakened. Her\nlabours might, it appeared, relieve the wants or increase the comforts\nof her father's age; and, with a face that glowed with enthusiasm, and\neyes that sparkled with renovated hope, she eagerly advanced to question\nthe critic as to the value of her work. In reply, he named a price so\nfar exceeding her expectations, that her resolution was formed in a\nmoment. She would accompany her father to London, and there try what\npecuniary advantage was to be derived from her talent. On a scheme which\nwas to repair all her father's losses, prudence had not time to pause;\nand, feeling company rather a restraint on her pleasure, Laura ran to\nher apartment, rather to enjoy than to reconsider her plan. Having spent\nsome time in delighted anticipation of the pleasure which her father\nwould take in the new team and thrashing-mill with which she would adorn\nhis farm, and the comfort he would enjoy in the new books and easy sofa\nwith which her labours would furnish his library, she recollected a\nhundred questions that she wished to ask the stranger, concerning the\nbest means of disposing of her future productions, and she ran down\nstairs to renew the conversation--but the parlour was empty, the\nstranger was gone. No matter. No trifle could at this moment have\ndiscomposed Laura; and, with steps as light as a heart from which, for a\ntime, all selfish griefs were banished, she crossed the little lawn in\nsearch of her father.\n\nThe moment she overtook him, locking her arm in his, and looking\nsmilingly up in his face, she began so urgent an entreaty to be admitted\nas the companion of his journey, that Captain Montreville, with some\ncuriosity, inquired what had excited in her this sudden inclination to\ntravel? Laura blushed and hesitated; for though her plan had, in her own\nopinion, all the charms which we usually attribute to the new born\nchildren of our fancy, she felt that an air of more prudence and\nforethought might be requisite to render it equally attractive in the\neyes of Captain Montreville. She exerted, however, all the rhetoric she\ncould at that moment command, to give her scheme a plausible appearance.\nWith respect to herself, she was entirely successful; and she ventured\nto cast a look of triumphant appeal on her father. Captain Montreville,\nunwilling to refuse the request of his darling, remained silent; but at\nthe detail of her plan, he shook his head. Now, to a projector of\neighteen, a shake of the head is, of all gestures, the most offensive;\nand the smile which usually accompanies it, miserably perverts the\noffice of a smile. Tears, half of sorrow, half of vexation, forced their\nway to the eyes of Laura; and she walked silently on, without courage to\nrenew the attack, till they were joined by Mrs Douglas. Disconcerted by\nher ill success with her father, Laura felt little inclination to\nsubject her scheme to the animadversions of her friend; but Captain\nMontreville, expecting an auxiliary, by whose aid he might conquer the\nweakness of yielding without conviction, called upon Mrs Douglas, in a\nmanner which shewed him secure of her reply, to give her opinion of\nLaura's proposal. Mrs Douglas, who had heard, with a degree of horror,\nof the intention to consign Laura to solitude in her present state of\nsuppressed dejection, and who considered new scenes and new interests as\nindispensable to her restoration, interpreting the asking looks of the\nfair petitioner, surprised Captain Montreville by a decided verdict in\nher favour. Rapturously thanking her advocate, Laura now renewed her\nintreaties with such warmth, that her father, not possessed of that\nfacility in refusing which results from practice, gave a half-reluctant\nacquiescence. The delight which his consent conveyed to Laura, which\nsparkled in her expressive features, and animated her artless gestures,\nconverted his half-extorted assent into cordial concurrence; for to the\ndefects of any scheme that gave her pleasure, he was habitually blind.\n\nIn the course of the evening, Captain Montreville announced that, in\norder to give his daughter time to prepare for her journey, it would be\nnecessary for them to return to Glenalbert on the following morning.\n\nWhile Mrs Douglas was assisting Laura to pack up her little wardrobe,\nshe attempted to break her guarded silence on the subject of Hargrave,\nby saying, 'I doubt this same journey of your's will prevent Colonel\nHargrave from trying the effects of perseverance, which I used to think\nthe most infallible resort in love, as well as in more serious\nundertakings.' Laura began a most diligent search for something upon the\ncarpet. 'Poor Hargrave,' Mrs Douglas resumed, 'he is a great favourite\nof mine. I wish he had been more successful.' Laura continued\nindustriously cramming a bandbox. 'All these gowns and petticoats will\ncrush your new bonnet to pieces, my dear.' Laura suddenly desisted from\nher employment, rose, and turning full towards Mrs Douglas, said--'It is\nunkind, it is cruel, thus to urge me, when you know that duty more than\ninclination keeps me silent.' 'Pardon me, my dear Laura,' said Mrs\nDouglas, 'I have no wish to persecute you; but you know I was ignorant\nthat Colonel Hargrave was our interdicted subject.'\n\nShe then entered on another topic; and Laura, vexed at the partial\ndisclosure she had inadvertently made, uneasy at being the object of\nconstant scrutiny, and hurt at being obliged to thwart the habitual\nopenness of her temper, felt less sorry than relieved as she sprung into\nthe carriage that was to convey her to Glenalbert. So true is it, that\nconcealment is the bane of friendship.\n\nOther interests, too, quickened her desire to return home. She longed,\nwith a feeling which could not be called hope, though it far exceeded\ncuriosity, to know whether Hargrave had called or written during her\nabsence; and the moment the chaise stopped, she flew to the table where\nthe letters were deposited to wait their return. There were none for\nher. She interrupted Nanny's expression of joy at the sight of her\nmistress, by asking who had called while they were from home. 'Nobody\nbut Miss Willis.' Laura's eyes filled with tears of bitterness. 'I am\neasily relinquished,' thought she--'but it is better that it should be\nso;' and she dashed away the drops as they rose.\n\nShe would fain have vented her feelings in the solitude of her chamber;\nbut this was her father's first return to a widowed home, and she would\nnot leave him to its loneliness. She entered the parlour. Captain\nMontreville was already there; and, cheerfully welcoming him home, she\nshook up the cushion of an elbow-chair by the fire-side, and invited him\nto sit. 'No, love,' said he, gently compelling her, 'do you take that\nseat; it was your mother's.' Laura saw his lip quiver, and, suppressing\nthe sob that swelled her bosom, she tenderly withdrew him from the room,\nled him to the garden, invited his attention to her new-blown\ncarnations, and gradually diverted his regard to such cheerful objects,\nthat, had Captain Montreville examined what was passing in his own mind,\nhe must have confessed that he felt the loss of Lady Harriet less as a\ncompanion than an antagonist. She was more a customary something which\nit was unpleasant to miss from its place, than a real want which no\nsubstitute could supply. Laura's conversation, on the contrary, amusing\nwithout effort, ingenious without constraint, and rational without\nstiffness, furnished to her father a real and constant source of\nenjoyment; because, wholly exempt from all desire to shine, she had\nleisure to direct to the more practicable art of pleasing, those efforts\nby which so many others vainly attempt to dazzle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nThe three following days Laura employed in making arrangements for her\njourney. Desirous to enliven the solitude in which she was about to\nleave her only attendant, she consigned the care of the cottage, during\nher absence, to the girl's mother, who was likewise her own nurse; and\ncautious of leaving to the temptations of idleness, one for whose\nconduct she felt herself in some sort accountable, she allotted to Nanny\nthe task of making winter clothing for some of the poorest inhabitants\nof Glenalbert; a task which her journey prevented her from executing\nherself. Nor were the materials of this little charity subtracted from\nher father's scanty income, but deducted from comforts exclusively her\nown.\n\nThough, in the bustle of preparation, scarcely a moment remained\nunoccupied, Laura could not always forbear from starting at the sound of\nthe knocker, or following with her eyes the form of a horseman winding\nthrough the trees. In vain she looked--in vain she listened. The\nexpected stranger came not--the expected voice was unheard. She tried to\nrejoice at the desertion: 'I am glad of it,' she would say to herself,\nwhile bitter tears were bursting from her eyes. She often reproached\nherself with the severity of her language at her last interview with\nHargrave. She asked herself what right she had to embitter\ndisappointment by unkindness, or to avenge insult by disdain. Her\nbehaviour appeared to her, in the retrospect, ungentle, unfeminine,\nunchristian. Yet she did not for a moment repent her rejection, nor\nwaver for a moment in her resolution to adhere to it. Her soul sickened\nat the thought, that she had been the object of licentious passion\nmerely; and she loathed to look upon her own lovely form, while she\nthought that it had seduced the senses, but failed to touch the soul of\nHargrave.\n\nAmidst these employments and feelings the week had closed; and the\nSabbath evening was the last which Laura was to spend at Glenalbert.\nThat evening had long been her chosen season of meditation, the village\nchurch-yard the scene where she loved to 'go forth to meditate.' The way\nwhich led to it, and to it alone, was a shady green lane, gay with\nveronica and hare-bell, undefaced by wheels, but marked in the middle\nwith one distinct track, and impressed towards the sides with several\nstraggling half-formed footpaths. The church itself stood detached from\nthe village, on a little knoll, on the west side of which the\nburial-ground sloped towards the woody bank that bounded a brawling\nmountain stream. Thither Laura stole, when the sun, which had been hid\nby the rugged hill, again rolling forth from behind the precipitous\nascent, poured through the long dale his rays upon this rustic cemetery;\nthe only spot in the valley sufficiently elevated to catch his parting\nbeam.\n\n'How long, how deep is the shadow--how glorious in brightness the\nreverse,' said she, as she seated herself under the shade of the newly\nraised grave-stone that marked the place of her mother's rest; and\nturning her mind's eye from what seemed a world of darkness, she raised\nit to scenes of everlasting light. Her fancy, as it soared to regions of\nbliss without alloy, looked back with something like disgust on the\nlabours that were to prepare her for their enjoyment, and a feeling\nalmost of disappointment and impatience accompanied the recollection,\nthat her pilgrimage was to all appearance only beginning. But she\nchecked the feeling as it rose, and, in penitence and resignation,\nraised her eyes to heaven. They rested as they fell upon a stone marked\nwith the name and years of one who died in early youth. Laura remembered\nher well--she was the beauty of Glenalbert; but her lover left her for a\nricher bride, and her proud spirit sunk beneath the stroke. The village\nartist had depicted her want of resignation in a rude sculpture of the\nprophet's lamentation over his withered gourd. 'My gourd, too, is\nwithered,' said Laura. 'Do I well to be angry even unto death? Will the\ngiver of all good leave me even here without comfort? Shall I refuse to\nfind pleasure in any duties but such as are of my own selection: Because\nthe gratification of one passion--one misplaced passion, is refused, has\nthis world no more to offer? this fair world, which its great Creator\nhas stamped with his power, and stored by his bounty, and ennobled by\nmaking it the temple of his worshippers, the avenue to heaven! Shall I\nfind no balm in the consolations of friendship, the endearments of\nparental love--no joy in the sweets of benevolence, the stores of\nknowledge, the miracles of grace! Oh! may I ever fearlessly confide in\nthe fatherly care, that snatched me from the precipice from which my\nrash confidence was about to plunge me to my ruin--that opened my eyes\non my danger ere retreat was impossible.'\n\nThe reflections of Laura were disturbed by the noise of some one\nspringing over the fence; and, the next moment, Hargrave was at her\nside. Laura uttered neither shriek nor exclamation--but she turned; and,\nwith steps as precipitate as would bear the name of walking, proceeded\ntowards the gate. Hargrave followed her. 'Am I indeed so happy as to\nfind you alone?' said he. Laura replied not, by word or look. 'Suffer me\nto detain you for a few moments.' Laura rather quickened her pace. 'Will\nyou not speak to me Miss Montreville?' said Hargrave, in a tone of\ntender reproach. Laura continued to advance. 'Stay but one moment,' said\nhe, in a voice of supplication. Laura laid her hand upon the gate.\nHargrave's patience was exhausted. 'By heaven you _shall_ hear me!' he\ncried, and, throwing his arm round her, compelled her to be seated on\nthe stone-bench at the gate. Laura coldly withdrew herself. 'By what\nright, Sir,' said she, 'do you presume to detain me?' 'By the right of\nwretchedness--of misery not to be endured. Since I last saw you, I have\nnever known rest or peace. Surely, Laura, you are now sufficiently\navenged--surely your stubborn pride may now condescend to hear\nme.'--'Well, Sir,' said Laura, without attempting to depart; 'what are\nyour commands?' 'Oh, Laura, I cannot bear your displeasure--it makes me\nsupremely miserable. If you have any pity, grant me your forgiveness.'\n'If my forgiveness is of any value to you, I give it you, I trust, like\na Christian--from the heart. Now, then, suffer me to go.'\n\n'What--think you it is the frozen forgiveness of duty that will content\nme? Torn, as I am, by every passion that can drive man to frenzy, think\nyou that I will accept--that I will endure this heartless, scornful\npardon? Laura, you loved me once. I have doated on you--pined for\nyou--and passion--passion only--will I accept, or bear from you.'\n\nLaura shrunk trembling from his violence. 'Colonel Hargrave,' said she,\n'if you do not restrain this vehemence, I must, I will be gone. I would\nfain spare you unnecessary pain; but while you thus agitate yourself, my\nstay is useless to you, and to me most distressing.' 'Say, then, that\nyou accept my vows--that, hopeless of happiness but with me, you bind\nyourself to me alone, and for ever. Speak, heavenly creature, and bless\nme beyond the fairest dreams of hope!'\n\n'Colonel Hargrave,' said Laura, 'you have my forgiveness. My--what shall\nI say--my esteem you have cast from you--my best wishes for your\nhappiness shall ever be yours--more I cannot give. In pity to yourself,\nthen--in pity to me--renounce one who can never be yours.'\n\nHargrave's eyes flashed fire, while his countenance faded to ghastly\npaleness. 'Yes;' he exclaimed, 'cold, pitiless, insensible woman--yes I\nrenounce you. In the haunts of riot, in the roar of intemperance, will I\nforget that form, that voice--and, when I am lost to fame, to health, to\nusefulness--my ruin be on your soul.' 'Oh! Hargrave,' cried the\ntrembling Laura, 'talk not so wildly; Heaven will hear my prayers for\nyou.--Amidst the pursuits of wisdom--amidst the attractions of others,\nyou will forget me.'\n\n'Forget you! Never. While I have life, I will follow\nyou--supplicate--persecute you.--Mine you shall be, though infamy and\ndeath ensue. Dare not,' said he, grasping her arm,--'dare not to seek\nthe protection of another.--Dare but to give him one smile, and his life\nshall be the forfeit.'\n\n'Alas! Alas!' cried Laura, wringing her hands in anguish, 'this is real\nfrenzy. Compose yourself, I implore you--there is no other--there never\ncan be'--\n\nHer tears recalled Hargrave to something like composure. 'Dearest\nLaura,' said he, 'I wish to soften--I only terrify you. Fear not,\nbeloved of my soul--speak to me without alarm. I will hear you, if it be\npossible, with calmness--but say not, oh! say not, that you reject me!'\nLaura averted her face. 'Why prolong this distressing interview,' said\nshe,--'You have heard my determination. I know that it is right, and I\ncannot relinquish it.'\n\nThe triumph of self-conquest gave firmness to her voice; and Hargrave,\ndriven again from composure by her self-command, sprang from her side.\n'It is well, Madam,' he cried; 'triumph in the destruction of my peace;\nbut think not I will so tamely resign you. No; by Heaven. I will go this\nmoment to your father--I will tell him my offence; and ask if he thinks\nit deserves such punishment. Let him take my life--I abhor it.'\n\n'Is your promise, then, of such small avail?' said Laura, sternly.\n\n'Shall a promise bind me to a life of wretchedness? Shall I regard the\nfeelings of one who takes an inhuman pleasure in my sufferings?' At this\nmoment Laura's eyes fell on her father, who was entering the little\navenue. Hargrave's glance followed hers, and he prepared to join Captain\nMontreville. In an agony of terror, Laura grasped his arm. 'Spare me,\nspare me,' she said, 'and do with me what you will!' Captain Montreville\nsaw that the walk was occupied; he turned from it, and Laura had again\ntime to breathe. 'Say, then,' said Hargrave, softened by her\nemotion,--'say that, when years of penitence have atoned my offence, you\nwill yet be mine.' Laura covered her face with her hands. 'Let me not\nhear you--let me not look upon you,' said Laura;--'leave me to think, if\nit be possible,'--and she poured a silent prayer to Heaven for help in\nthis her sorest trial. The effort composed her, and the majesty of\nvirtue gave dignity to her form, and firmness to her voice, while she\nsaid,--'My father's life is in the hands of Providence--it will still be\nso, when I have repeated to you, that I dare not trust to principles\nsuch as yours the guardianship of this the infancy of my being. I dare\nnot incur certain guilt to escape contingent evil. I cannot make you the\ncompanion of this uncertain life, while your conduct is such, as to make\nour eternal separation the object of my dreadful hope.'\n\nHargrave had trusted that the tenderness of Laura would seduce, or his\nardour overpower her firmness; but he read the expression of her pale\ndetermined countenance, and felt assured that she was lost to him\nforever. Convinced that all appeal to her feelings would be hopeless, he\nwould deign to make none; but in a voice made almost inarticulate by the\nstruggle of pride and anguish, he said,--'Miss Montreville, your\nfather's life is safe from me--I will not lift my hand against it. That\nhe should take mine is of small importance, either to you or myself. A\nviolent death,' continued he, his pale lip quivering with a smile of\nbitterness,--'may perhaps procure me your tardy pity.'\n\nFrom the storm of passion, Laura had shrunk with terror and dismay; but\nthe voice of suppressed anguish struck her to the soul. 'Oh! Hargrave,'\nshe cried, with tears no longer to be restrained, 'you have my tenderest\npity--would to Heaven that the purity of your future life would restore\nme to the happiness of esteeming you!'\n\nLaura's tenderness revived, in a moment, the hopes of Hargrave. 'Angel\nof sweetness,' he exclaimed, 'mould me to your will--say that, when\npurified by years of repentance, you will again bless me with your love;\nand no exertion will be too severe--no virtue too arduous.'\n\n'No; this I dare not promise; let a higher motive influence you; for it\nis not merely the conduct--it is the heart that must have changed, ere I\ndurst expose my feeble virtue to the trial of your example--your\nauthority; ere I durst make it my duty to shut my eyes against your\nfaults, or to see them with the indulgence of love.'\n\n'Dearest Laura, one word from you will lure me back to the path of\nvirtue--will you wilfully destroy even the wish to return. If for a\nyear--for two years--my conduct should bear the strictest scrutiny--will\nyou not accept this as a proof that my heart is changed--changed in\nevery thing but its love for you--will you not then receive me?'\n\nLaura had resisted entreaty--had withstood alarm--had conquered strong\naffection; but the hope of rousing Hargrave to the views, the pursuits,\nthe habits of a Christian, betrayed her caution, and gladdened her heart\nto rapture. 'If for two years,' said she, her youthful countenance\nbrightening with delight, 'your conduct is such as you describe--if it\nwill bear the inspection of the wise, of the sober-minded, of the\npious,--as my father's friend, as my own friend, will I welcome you.'\n\nThus suddenly raised from despair, Hargrave seemed at the summit of\nfelicity. Once admitted as her 'father's friend, as her own,' he was\nsecure of the accomplishment of his wishes. The time that must first\nelapse, appeared to him but a moment; and the labours of duty required\nof him seemed a smiling dream. Love and joy animated every feature of\nhis fine countenance; he threw himself at the feet of Laura, and\nrapturously blessed her for her condescension. His extasies first made\nher sensible of the extent of her concession; and she feared that she\nhad gone too far. But with her, a promise, however inadvertent, was a\nsacred thing, which she would neither qualify nor retract. She contented\nherself, therefore, with merely repeating the terms of it, emphatically\nguarding the conditions. Desirous now to have leisure for reflection,\nshe reminded him that the lateness of the hour made it fit that he\nshould depart; and, inwardly persuaded that she would not long\nobdurately refuse him another interview, he obeyed without much\nopposition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe lovers were no sooner parted, than Hargrave began to repent that he\nhad not more distinctly ascertained the kind and manner of the\nintercourse which he was to hold with his mistress during the term of\nhis probation; and though he had little fear that she would be very\nrigid, he considered this as a point of such importance, that he\nresolved not to quit Glenalbert without having the matter settled to his\nsatisfaction. For this reason he condescended to accept the\naccommodations of the little straw-roofed cottage, by courtesy called\nthe Inn, where he had already left his horse; and thither he retired\naccordingly, not without some national misgivings of mind on the subject\nof Scotish nastiness and its consequences. His apartment, however,\nthough small, was decent, his bed was clean, his sleep refreshing, and\nhis dreams pleasant; nor was it till a late hour the following morning,\nthat he rose to the homely comfort, and clumsy abundance of a Highland\nbreakfast. As soon as he had finished his repast, he walked towards\nMontreville's cottage, ostensibly to pay his respects to the Captain,\nbut, in reality, with the hope of obtaining a private interview with\nLaura. He entered the garden, where he expected to find Captain\nMontreville. It was empty. He approached the house. The shutters were\nbarred. He knocked at the door, which was opened by the old woman; and,\non inquiring for Captain Montreville, he was answered, 'Wow, Sir, him\nan' Miss Laura's awa' at six o'clock this morning.' 'Away,' repeated the\nColonel,--'Where are they gone?' 'To London, Sir; and I'm sure a lanely\ntime we'll hae till they come hame again.' 'What stay do they intend\nmaking?' 'Hech, Sir, I dare say that's what they dinna ken themsels.'\n'What is their address?' inquired the Colonel. 'What's your will, Sir:'\n'Where are they to be found?' 'Am'n I tellan you they're in London, Sir.\nI'm sure ye ken whar that is?' 'But how are you to send their letters?'\n'Wow! they never got mony letters but frae England; and now 'at they're\nin London, ye ken the folk may gie them into their ain hand.' 'But\nsuppose you should have occasion to write to them yourself?' said\nHargrave, whose small stock of patience wore fast to a close. 'Hech,\nSir, sorrow a scrape can I write. They learn a' thae newfangled things\nnow; but, trouth, i' my young days, we were na' sae upsettan.' Hargrave\nwas in no humour to canvas the merits of the different modes of\neducation; and, muttering an ejaculation, in which the word _devil_ was\ndistinctly audible, he turned away.\n\nVexed and disappointed, he wandered down the churchyard-lane, and\nreached the spot where he had last seen Laura. He threw himself on the\nseat that had supported her graceful form--called to mind her consummate\nloveliness--her ill-repressed tenderness--and most cordially consigned\nhimself to Satan for neglecting to wring from her some further\nconcessions. She was now removed from the solitude where he had reigned\nwithout a rival. Her's would be the gaze of every eye--her's the command\nof every heart. 'She may soon choose among numbers,' cried he,--'she\nwill meet with people of her own humour, and some canting hypocritical\nscoundrel will drive me completely from her mind.' By the time he had\nuttered this prediction, and bit his lip half through--he was some steps\non his way to order his horses, that he might pursue his fair fugitive,\nin the hope of extorting from her some less equivocal kind of promise.\nFortunately for his reputation for sanity, however, he recollected,\nbefore he began his pursuit, that, ere he could overtake her, Laura must\nhave reached Edinburgh, where, without a direction, it might be\ndifficult to discover her abode. In this dilemma, he was again obliged\nto have recourse to the old woman at the cottage; but she could give him\nno information. She neither knew how long Captain Montreville purposed\nremaining in Edinburgh, nor in what part of the town he intended to\nreside.\n\nThus baffled in his inquiries, Hargrave was convinced that his pursuit\nmust be ineffectual; and, in no very placid frame of mind, he changed\nhis destination from Edinburgh to his quarters. He arrived there in time\nfor a late dinner, but his wine was insipid, his companions tiresome;\nand he retired early, that, early next morning, he might set out on a\nvisit to Mrs Douglas, from whom he purposed to learn Captain\nMontreville's address.\n\nOn comparing the suppressed melancholy of Laura, her embarrassment at\nthe mention of Hargrave, and her inadvertent disclosure, with her\nfather's detail of her rejection of the insinuating young soldier, a\nsuspicion not very remote from truth, had entered the mind of Mrs\nDouglas. She imagined that Captain Montreville had in some way been\ndeceived as to the kind of proposals made to his daughter; and that\nLaura had rejected no offers but such as it would have been infamy to\naccept. Under this conviction, it is not surprising that her reception\nof the Colonel was far from being cordial; nor that, guessing his\ncorrespondence to be rather intended for the young lady than for the old\ngentleman, she chose to afford no facility to an intercourse which she\nconsidered as both dangerous and degrading. To Hargrave's questions,\ntherefore, she answered, that until she should hear from London, she was\nignorant of Captain Montreville's address; and that the time of his\nreturn was utterly unknown to her. When the Colonel, with the same\nintention, soon after repeated his visit, she quietly, but steadily,\nevaded all his inquiries, equally unmoved by his entreaties, and the\nparoxysms of impatience with which he endured his disappointment.\n\nHargrave was the only child of a widow--an easy, indolent, good sort of\nwoman, who would gladly have seen him become every thing that man ought\nto be, provided she could have accomplished this laudable desire without\nrecourse to such harsh instruments as contradiction and restraint. But\nof these she disliked the use, as much as her son did the endurance: and\nthus the young gentleman was educated, or rather grew up, without the\nslightest acquaintance of either. Of consequence, his naturally warm\ntemper became violent, and his constitutionally strong passions\nungovernable.\n\nHargrave was the undoubted heir of a title, and of a fine estate. Of\nmoney he had never felt the want, and did not know the value; he was,\ntherefore, so far as money was concerned, generous even to profusion.\nHis abilities were naturally of the highest order. To force him to the\nimprovement of them, was an effort above the power of Mrs Hargrave; but,\nfortunately for him, ere his habits of mental inaction were\nirremediable, a tedious illness confined him to recreations in which\nmind had some share, however small. During the interdiction of bats and\nballs, he, by accident, stumbled on a volume of Peregrine Pickle, which\nhe devoured with great eagerness; and his mother, delighted with what\nshe was pleased to call a _turn for reading_, took care that this new\nappetite should not, any more than the old ones, pine for want of\ngratification. To direct it to food wholesome and invigorating, would\nhave required unremitting though gentle labour: and to labour of all\nkinds Mrs Hargrave had a practical antipathy. But it was very easy to\nsupply the young man with romances, poetry, and plays; and it was\npleasing to mistake their intoxicating effect for the bursts of mental\nvigour. A taste for works of fiction, once firmly established, never\nafter yielded to the attractions of sober truth; and, though his\nknowledge of history was neither accurate nor extensive, Hargrave could\nboast of an intimate acquaintance with all the plays, with almost all\nthe poetry, and as far as it is attainable by human diligence, with all\nthe myriads of romances in his mother tongue. He had chosen, of his own\nfree-will, to study the art of playing on the flute; the violin\nrequiring more patience than he had to bestow; and emulation, which\nfailed to incite him to more useful pursuits, induced him to try whether\nhe could not draw as well as his play-fellow, De Courcy. At the age of\nseventeen he had entered the army. As he was of good family, of an\nelegant figure, and furnished by nature with one of the finest\ncountenances she ever formed, his company was courted in the highest\ncircles, and to the ladies he was particularly acceptable. Among such\nassociates, his manners acquired a high polish; and he improved in what\nis called knowledge of the world; that is, a facility of discovering,\nand a dexterity in managing the weaknesses of others. One year--one\ntedious year, his regiment had been quartered in the neighbourhood of\nthe retirement where the afore-said De Courcy was improving his 'few\npaternal acres;' and, partly by his persuasion and example, partly from\nhaving little else to do, partly because it was the fashionable science\nof the day, Hargrave had prosecuted the study of chemistry. Thus have we\ndetailed, and in some measure accounted for, the whole of Colonel\nHargrave's accomplishments, excepting only, perhaps, the one in which he\nmost excelled--he danced inimitably. For the rest, he had what is called\na good heart; that is, he disliked to witness or inflict pain, except\nfrom some incitement stronger than advantage to the sufferer. His fine\neyes had been seen to fill with tears at a tale of _elegant_ distress;\nhe could even compassionate the more vulgar sorrows of cold and hunger\nto the extent of relieving them, provided always that the relief cost\nnothing but money. Some casual instances of his feeling, and of his\ncharity, had fallen under the observation of Laura; and upon these, upon\nthe fascination of his manners, and the expression of his countenance,\nher fervid imagination had grafted every virtue that can exalt or adorn\nhumanity. Gentle reader, excuse the delusion. Laura was only\nseventeen--Hargrave was the first handsome man of fashion she had ever\nknown, the first who had ever poured into her ear the soothing voice of\nlove.\n\nUnprepared to find, in an obscure village in Scotland, the most perfect\nmodel of dignified loveliness, Hargrave became the sudden captive of her\ncharms; and her manner, so void of all design,--the energy--the\nsometimes wild poetic grace of her language--the shrewdness with which\nshe detected, and the simplicity with which she unveiled, the latent\nmotives of action, whether in herself or in others, struck him with all\nthe force of contrast, as he compared them with the moulded artificial\nstandard of the day. His interest in her was the strongest he had ever\nfelt, even before it was heightened by a reserve that came too late to\nrepress or conceal the tenderness with which she repaid his passion. Yet\nHargrave was not less insensible to the real charms of Laura's mind,\nthan she was unconscious of the defects in his. Her benevolence pleased\nhim; for bright eyes look brighter through tears of sympathy, and no\nsmile is so lovely as that which shines on the joys of others. Her\nmodesty charmed him; for every voluptuary can tell what allurements\nblushes add to beauty. But of her self-denial and humility he made no\naccount. Her piety, never obtruded on his notice, had at first escaped\nhis observation altogether; and, now that it thwarted his favourite\npursuit, he considered it merely as a troublesome prejudice. Of all her\nvaluable qualities, her unfailing sweetness of temper was perhaps the\nonly one that he valued for its own sake. But her person he idolized. To\nobtain her no exertion would have appeared too formidable; and,\nremembering the conditions of their future reconciliation, he began, for\nthe first time in his life, to consider his conduct with a view to its\nmoral fitness.\n\nThis he found a subject of inextricable difficulty. He was ignorant of\nthe standard by which Laura would judge him. He was willing to believe\nthat, if she were left to herself, it would not be severe; but the words\nof her promise seemed to imply, that his conduct was to be subjected to\nthe scrutiny of less partial censors, and he felt some anxiety to know\nwho were to be his 'wise,' 'sober-minded,' 'pious' inspectors. He did\nnot game, his expences did not much exceed his income, therefore he\ncould imagine no change in his deportment necessary to conciliate the\n'wise.' Though, under the name of sociality, he indulged freely in wine,\nhe seldom exceeded to intoxication. Here again reform seemed needless.\nBut, that he might give no offence to the 'sober-minded,' he intended to\nconduct his indispensable gallantries with great discretion, he\ndetermined to refrain from all approach to seduction, and magnanimously\nresolved to abstain from the molestation of innocent country-girls and\ndecent maid-servants. Finally, to secure the favour of the 'pious,' he\nforthwith made a purchase of Blair's sermons, and resolved to be seen in\nChurch once at least every Sunday.\n\nIt might be supposed, that when the scale of duty which we trace is low,\nwe should be more likely to reach the little eminence at which we\naspire; but experience shews us, that they who poorly circumscribe the\nChristian race, stop as much short of their humble design, as does he of\nhis nobler purpose, whose glorious goal is perfection. The sequel will\nshow the attainments of Colonel Hargrave in the ways of virtue. In the\nmeantime his magnet of attraction to Perthshire was gone; he soon began\nto grow weary of the feeling of restraint, occasioned by supposing\nhimself the subject of a system of _espionage_; and to kill the time,\nand relieve himself from his imaginary shackles, he sought the\nassistance of the Edinburgh races; determined, that if Laura prolonged\nher stay in London, he would obtain leave of absence, and seek her\nthere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe grey lights of morning shone mild on Glenalbert, as the carriage,\nwhich was conveying Laura to scenes unknown, wound slowly up the hill.\nWith watery eyes she looked back on the quiet beauties of her native\nvalley. She listened to the dashing of its stream, till the murmur died\non her ear. Her lowly home soon glided behind the woods; but its early\nsmoke rose peaceful from amidst its sheltering oaks, till it blended\nwith the mists of morning; and Laura gazed on it as on the parting steps\nof a friend. 'Oh, vales!' she exclaimed, 'where my childhood\nsported--mountains that have echoed to my songs of praise, amidst your\nshades may my age find shelter--may your wild-flowers bloom on my\ngrave!'--Captain Montreville pressed the fair enthusiast to his breast\nand smiled. It was a smile of pity--for Montreville's days of enthusiasm\nwere past. It was a smile of pleasure--for we love to look upon the\ntranscript of our early feelings. But, whatever it expressed, it was\ndiscord with the tone of Laura's mind. It struck cold on her glowing\nheart; and she carefully avoided uttering a word that might call forth\nsuch another, till, bright gleaming in the setting sun, she first beheld\nromantic Edinburgh. 'Is it not glorious!' she cried, tears of wonder and\ndelight glittering in her eyes, and she longed for its re-appearance,\nwhen the descent of the little eminence which had favoured their view,\nexcluded the city from their sight.\n\nAs the travellers approached the town, Laura, whose attention was\nrivetted by the castle and its rocks, now frowning majestic in the\nshades of twilight, and by the antique piles that seemed the work of\ngiants, scarcely bestowed a glance on the neat row of modern buildings\nalong which she was passing, and she was sorry when the carriage turned\nfrom the objects of her admiration towards the hotel where Captain\nMontreville intended to lodge.\n\nNext morning, Laura, eager to renew the pleasure of the evening,\nproposed a walk; not without some dread of encountering the crowd which\nshe expected to find in such a city. Of this crowd, she had, indeed,\nseen nothing the night before; but she concluded, ere that she reached\ntown, most of the inhabitants had soberly retired to rest. At the season\nof the year, however, when Laura reached Edinburgh, she had little cause\nfor apprehension. The noble streets through which she passed had the\nappearance of being depopulated by pestilence. The houses were\nuninhabited, the window-shutters were closed, and the grass grew from\nthe crevices of the pavement. The few well-dressed people whom she saw,\nstared upon her with such oppressive curiosity, as gave the uninitiated\nLaura a serious uneasiness. At first she thought that some peculiarity\nin her dress occasioned this embarrassing scrutiny. But her dress was\nsimple mourning, and its form the least conspicuous possible. She next\nimagined, that to her rather unusual stature she owed this unenviable\nnotice; and, with a little displeasure, she remarked to her father, that\nit argued a strange want of delicacy to appear to notice the\npeculiarities of any one's figure; and that, in this respect, the upper\nranks seemed more destitute of politeness than their inferiors. Captain\nMontreville answered, with a smile, that he did not think it was her\nheight which drew such attention. 'Well,' said she, with great\nsimplicity, 'I must endeavour to find food for my vanity in this notice,\nthough it is rather against my doing so, that the women stare more\ntremendously than the gentlemen.'\n\nAs they passed the magnificent shops, the windows, gay with every\nvariety of colour, constantly attracted Laura's inexperienced eye; and\nshe asked Montreville to accompany her into one where she wished to\npurchase some necessary trifle. The shopman observing her attention\nfixed on a box of artificial flowers, spread them before her; and tried\nto invite her to purchase, by extolling the cheapness and beauty of his\ngoods. 'Here is a charming sprig of myrtle, ma'am; and here is a\ngeranium-wreath, the most becoming thing for the hair--only seven\nshillings each, ma'am.' Laura owned the flowers were beautiful. 'But I\nfear,' said she, looking compassionately at the man, 'you will never be\nable to sell them all. There are so few people who would give seven\nshillings for what is of no use whatever.' 'I am really sorry for that\npoor young man,' said she to her father, when they left the shop. 'Tall,\nrobust, in the very flower of his age, how he must feel humbled by\nbeing obliged to attend to such trumpery?' 'Why is your pity confined to\nhim?' said Montreville. 'There were several others in the same\nsituation.' 'Oh! but they were children, and may do something better by\nand by. But the tall one, I suppose, is the son of some weak mother, who\nfears to trust him to fight his country's battles. It is hard that she\nshould have power to compel him to such degradation; I really felt for\nhim when he twirled those flowers between his finger and thumb, and\nlooked so much in earnest about nothing.' The next thing which drew\nLaura's attention was a stay-maker's sign. 'Do the gentlemen here wear\ncorsets?' said she to Montreville. 'Not many of them, I believe,' said\nMontreville. 'What makes you inquire?' 'Because there is a _man_\nopposite who makes corsets. It cannot surely be for women.'\n\nCaptain Montreville had only one female acquaintance in Edinburgh, a\nlady of some fashion, and hearing that she was come to town to remain\ntill after the races, he that forenoon carried Laura to wait upon her.\nThe lady received them most graciously, inquired how long they intended\nto stay in Edinburgh; and on being answered that they were to leave it\nin two days, overwhelmed them with regrets, that the shortness of their\nstay precluded her from the pleasure of their company for a longer\nvisit. Laura regretted it too; but utterly ignorant of the time which\nmust elapse between a fashionable invitation and the consequent visit,\nshe could not help wondering whether the lady was really engaged for\neach of the four daily meals of two succeeding days.\n\nThese days, Captain Montreville and his daughter passed in examining\nthis picturesque city--its public libraries, its antique castle, its\nforsaken palace, and its splendid scenery. But nothing in its singular\nenvirons more charmed the eye of Laura than one deserted walk, where,\nthough the noise of multitudes stole softened on the ear, scarcely a\ntrace of human existence was visible, except the ruin of a little chapel\nwhich peeped fancifully from the ledge of a rock, and reminded her of\nthe antick gambols of the red deer on her native hills, when, from the\nbrink of the precipice, they look fearless into the dell below. Captain\nMontreville next conducted his daughter to the top of the fantastic\nmountain that adorns the immediate neighbourhood of Edinburgh, and\ntriumphantly demanded whether she had ever seen such a prospect. But\nLaura was by no means disposed to let Perthshire yield the palm to\nLowland scenery. Here indeed, the prospect was varied and extensive, but\nthe objects were too various, too distant, too gay--they glared on the\neye--the interest was lost. The serpentine corn-ridges, offensive to\nagricultural skill; the school, with its well frequented Gean-tree; the\nbright green clover fields, seen at intervals through the oak coppice;\nthe church, half hid by its venerable ash trees; the feathery birch,\ntrembling in the breath of evening; the smoking hamlet, its soft colours\nblending with those of the rocks that sheltered it; the rill, dashing\nwith fairy anger in the channel which its winter fury had\nfurrowed--these were the simple objects which had charms for Laura, not\nto be rivalled by neat enclosures and whitened villas. Yet the scenes\nbefore her were delightful, and had not Captain Montreville's appeal\nrecalled the comparison, she would, in the pleasure which they excited,\nhave forgotten the less splendid beauties of Glenalbert.\n\nMontreville pointed out the road that led to England. Laura sent a\nlonging look towards it, as it wound amid woods and villages and gentle\nswells, and was lost to the eye in a country which smiled rich and\ninviting from afar. She turned her eyes where the Forth is lost in the\nboundless ocean, and sighed as she thought of the perils and hardships\nof them who go down to the sea in ships. Montreville, unwilling to\nsubject her to the inconveniencies of a voyage, had proposed to continue\nhis journey by land, and Laura herself could not think without\nreluctance of tempting the faithless deep. The scenery, too, which a\njourney promised to present, glowed in her fervid imagination with more\nthan nature's beauty. Yet feeling the necessity of rigid economy, and\ndetermined not to permit her too indulgent parent to consult her\naccommodation at the expence of his prudence, she it was, who persuaded\nMontreville to prefer a passage by sea, as the mode of conveyance best\nsuited to his finances.\n\nThe next day our travellers embarked for London. The weather was fine,\nand Laura remained all day upon deck, amused with the novelty of her\nsituation. Till she left her native solitude, she had never even seen\nthe sea, except, when from a mountain top, it seemed far off to mingle\nwith the sky; and to her, the majestic Forth, as it widened into an\nestuary, seemed itself a 'world of waters.' But when on one side the\nland receded from the view, when the great deep lay before her, Laura\nlooked upon it for a moment, and shuddering, turned away. 'It is too\nmournful,' said she to her father--'were there but one spot, however\nsmall, however dimly descried, which fancy might people with beings like\nourselves, I could look with pleasure on the gulf between--but here\nthere is no resting place. Thus dismal, thus overpowering, methinks\neternity would have appeared, had not a haven of rest been made known to\nus.' Compared with the boundless expanse of waters, the little bark in\nwhich she was floating seemed 'diminished to a point;' and Laura raising\nher eyes to the stars that were beginning to glimmer through the\ntwilight, thought that such a speck was the wide world itself, amid the\nimmeasurable space in which it rolled. This was Laura's hour of prayer,\nand far less inviting circumstances can recal us to the acts of a\nsettled habit.\n\nFive days they glided smoothly along the coast. On the morning of the\nsixth, they entered the river, and the same evening reached London.\nLaura listened with something like dismay, to the mingled discord that\nnow burst upon her ear. The thundering of loaded carriages, the wild\ncries of the sailors, the strange dialect, the ferocious oaths of the\npopulace, seemed but parts of the deafening tumult. When they were\nseated in the coach which was to convey them from the quay, Laura begged\nher father to prevail on the driver to wait till the unusual concourse\nof carts and sledges should pass, and heard with astonishment that the\ndelay would be in vain. At last they arrived at the inn where Captain\nMontreville intended to remain till he could find lodgings; and, to\nLaura's great surprise, they completed their journey without being\njostled by any carriages, or overturned by any waggoner--for ought she\nknew, without running over any children.\n\nBeing shown into a front parlour, Laura seated herself at a window, to\ncontemplate the busy multitudes that thronged the streets; and she could\nnot help contrasting their number and appearance with those of the\ninhabitants of Edinburgh. There the loitering step, the gay attire, the\nvacant look, or the inquisitive glance, told that mere amusement was the\nobject of their walk, if indeed it had an object. Here, every face was\nfull of business--none stared, none sauntered, or had indeed the power\nto saunter, the double tide carrying them resistlessly along in one\ndirection or the other. Among all the varieties of feature that passed\nbefore her, Laura saw not one familiar countenance; and she\ninvoluntarily pressed closer to her father, while she thought, that\namong these myriads she should, but for him, be alone.\n\nCaptain Montreville easily found an abode suited to his humble\ncircumstances; and, the day after his arrival, he removed with his\ndaughter to the second floor above a shop in Holborn. The landlady was\na widow, a decent orderly-looking person; the apartments, though far\nfrom elegant, were clean and commodious. They consisted of a parlour,\ntwo bedchambers, and a small room, or rather closet, which Laura\nimmediately appropriated as her painting-room. Here she found amusement\nin arranging the materials of her art, while Captain Montreville walked\nto the west end of the town, to confer with his agent on the unfortunate\ncause of his visit to London. He was absent for some hours; and Laura,\nutterly ignorant of the length of his walk, and of its difficulties for\none who had not seen the metropolis for twenty years, began to be uneasy\nat his stay. He returned at last, fatigued and dispirited, without\nhaving seen Mr Baynard, who was indisposed, and could not admit him.\nAfter a silent dinner, he threw himself upon a sofa, and dismissed his\ndaughter, saying that he felt inclined to sleep. Laura took this\nopportunity to write to Mrs Douglas a particular account of her travels.\nShe mentioned with affectionate interest some of her few acquaintances\nat Glenalbert, and inquired for all the individuals of Mrs Douglas's\nfamily; but the name of Hargrave did not once occur in her letter,\nthough nothing could exceed her curiosity to know how the Colonel had\nborne her departure, of which, afraid of his vehemence, she had, at\ntheir last interview, purposely avoided to inform him.\n\nHaving finished her letter, Laura, that she might not appear to repress\ncivility, availed herself of her landlady's invitation to 'come now and\nthen,' as she expressed it, 'to have a chat;' and descended to the\nparlour below. On perceiving that Mrs Dawkins was busily arranging the\ntea equipage, with an air that showed she expected company, Laura would\nhave retreated, but her hostess would not suffer her to go. 'No, no,\nMiss,' said she, 'I expects nobody but my daughter Kate, as is married\nto Mr Jones the haberdasher; and you mustn't go, for she can tell you\nall about Scotland; and it is but natural to think that you'd like to\nhear about your own country, now when you're in a foreign land, as a\nbody may say.'\n\nThe good woman had judged well in the bribe she offered to her guest,\nwho immediately consented to join her party; and who, perceiving that\nMrs Dawkins was industriously spreading innumerable slices of bread and\nbutter, courteously offered to share her toils. Mrs Dawkins thanked her,\nand accepted her services, adding, 'indeed it's very hard as I should\nhave all them here things to do myself, when I have a grown up daughter\nin the house. But, poor thing, it a'n't her fault after all, for she\nnever was larnt to do nothing of use.' 'That was very unfortunate,'\nsaid Laura. 'Yes, but it might'nt have been so misfortunate neither,\nonly, you see, I'll tell you how it was. My sister, Mrs Smith, had a\nmatter of \u00c2\u00a310,000 left her by her husband, and so she took a fancy when\nJuly was born as she'd have her called a grand name; and I'm sure an\nunlucky name it was for her; for many a fine freak it has put into her\nhead. Well, and so as I was saying, she took July home to herself, and\nhad her larnt to paint, and to make fillagree, and play on the piano,\nand what not; and to be sure we thought she would never do less than\nprovide for her. But what do you think, why, two year's ago, she ran\naway with a young ensign, as had nothing in the varsal world but his\npay; and so July came home just as she went; and what was worst of all,\nshe could'nt do no more in the shop nor the day she was born.'\n\n'That was hard, indeed,' said Laura.\n\n'Wasn't it now,--but one comfort was, I had Kate brought up in another\nguess-way; for I larnt her plain work and writing, and how to cast\naccounts; and never let her touch a book, except the prayer-book\na-Sundays; and see what's the upshot on't. Why, though July's all to\nnothing the prettiest, nobody has never made an offer for she, and\nKate's got married to a warm man as any in his line hereabouts, and a\nman as has a house not ten doors off; and besides, as snug a box in the\ncountry as ever you seed,--so convenient you've no idear. Why, I dare\nsay, there's a matter of ten stage-coaches pass by the door every day.'\n\nTo all this family history, Laura listened with great patience,\nwondering, however, what could induce the narrator to take so much\ntrouble for the information of a stranger.\n\nThe conversation, if it deserves the name, was now interrupted by the\nentrance of a young woman, whom Mrs Dawkins introduced as her daughter\nJuly. Her figure was short, inclining to embonpoint--her face, though\nrather pretty, round and rosy,--and her whole appearance seemed the\nantipodes of sentiment. She had, however, a book in her hand, on which,\nafter exchanging compliments with Laura, she cast a languishing look,\nand said, 'I have been paying a watery tribute to the sorrows of my fair\nname-sake.' Then pointing out the title-page to Laura, she added, 'You,\nI suppose, have often done so.'\n\nIt was the tragedy of THE MINISTER, and Laura, reading the name aloud,\nsaid, she was not acquainted with it.\n\n'Oh,' cried Mrs Dawkins, 'that's the young woman as swears so horridly.\nNo, I dares to say, Miss Montreville never read no such thing. If it\nan't a shame to be seen in a Christian woman hands, it is. And if she\nwould read it by herself, it would be nothing; but there she goes,\nranting about the house like an actress, cursing all aloud, worser nor\nthe drunken apple-woman at the corner of the street.'\n\n'Pray Mamma, forbear,' said Miss Julia Dawkins, in a plaintive tone; 'it\nwounds my feelings to hear you. I am sure, if Miss Montreville would\nread this play, she would own that the expressions which you austerely\ndenominate curses, give irresistible energy to the language.'\n\n'This kind of energy,' said Laura, with a smile, 'has at least the merit\nof being very generally attainable.' This remark was not in Miss Julia's\nline. She had, therefore, recourse to her book, and with great variety\nof grimace, read aloud one of Casimir's impassioned, or, as Laura\nthought, frantic speeches. The curious contrast of the reader's manner,\nwith her appearance, of the affected sentimentality of her air, with the\nrobust vulgarity of her figure, struck Laura as so irresistibly\nludicrous, that, though of all young ladies, she was the least addicted\nto tittering, her politeness would have been fairly defeated in the\nstruggle, had it not been reinforced by the entrance of Mr and Mrs\nJones. The former was a little man, in a snuff-coloured coat, and a\nbrown wig, who seemed to be about fifty,--the latter was a good-humoured\ncommonplace looking woman, of about half that age. Laura was pleased\nwith the cordiality with which Mr Jones shook his mother-in-law by the\nhand, saying, 'Well, Mother, I's brought you Kate pure and hearty again,\nand the little fellow is fine and well, tho'f he be too young to come a\nwisiting.'\n\nAs soon as the commotion occasioned by their entrance was over, and\nLaura formally made acquainted with the lady, Mrs Dawkins began, 'I\nhopes, Kate, you ha'nt forgot how to tell about your jaunt to Scotland;\nfor this here young lady staid tea just o'purpose to hear it.' 'Oh, that\nI ha'nt,' said Mrs Jones, 'I'm sure I shall remember it the longest day\nI have to live.' 'Pray Miss,' added she, turning to Laura, 'was you ever\nin Glasgow?' 'Never,' said Laura; 'but I have heard that it is a fine\ncity.' 'Ay, but I've been there first and last eleven days; and I can\nsay for it, it is really a handsome town, and a mort of good white-stone\nhouses in it. For you see, when Mr Jones married me, he had not been\naltogether satisfied with his rider, and he thoft as he'd go down to\nGlasgow himself and do business; and that he'd make it do for his\nwedding jaunt, and that would be killing two dogs with one stone.'\n'That was certainly an excellent plan,' said Laura. 'Well,' continued\nMrs Jones, 'when we'd been about a week in Glasgow, we were had to dine\none day with Mr Mactavish, as supplies Mr Jones with ginghams; and he\ntalked about some grand house of one of your Scotch dukes, and said as\nhow we must'nt go home without seeing it. So we thought since we had\ncome so far, we might as well see what was to be seen.' 'Certainly,'\nsaid Laura, at the pause which was made to take breath, and receive\napprobation. 'Well, we went down along the river, which, to say truth,\nis very pretty, tho'f it be not turfed, nor kept neat round the edges,\nto a place they call Dumbarton; where there is a rock, for all the\nworld, like an ill-made sugar loaf, with a slice out o' the middle on't;\nand they told us there was a castle on it, but such a castle!' 'Pray,\nsister,' said Miss Julia, 'have you an accurate idea of what constitutes\na castle? of the keeps, the turrets, the winding staircases, and the\nportcullis?' 'Bless you, my dear,' returned the traveller, 'ha'nt I seen\nWindsor Castle, and t'other's no more like it--no more than nothing at\nall. Howsoever, we slept that night at a very decent sort of an inn; and\nMr Jones thought as we were so comfortable, we had best come back to\nsleep. So as the duke's house was but thirty miles off, we thought if we\nset off soon in the morning, we might get back at night. So off we set,\nand went two stages to breakfast, at a place with one of their\noutlandish names; and to be sartain, when we got there, we were as\nhungry as hounds. Well, we called for hot rolls; and, do but think,\nthere was'nt no such thing to be had for love or money.'\n\nMrs Jones paused to give Laura time for the expression of pity; but she\nremained silent, and Mrs Jones resumed: 'Well, they brought us a loaf as\nold as St Paul's, and some good enough butter; so thinks I, I'll make us\nsome good warm toast; for I loves to make the best of a bad bargain. So\nI bid the waiter bring us the toast-stool; but if you had seen how he\nstared,--why, the pore fellor had never heard of no such thing in his\nlife. Then they shewed us a huge mountain, as black as a sootbag, just\nopposite the window, and said as we must go up there; but, thinks I,\ncatch us at that; for if we be so bad off here for breakfast, what shall\nwe be there for dinner. So my husband and I were of a mind upon it, to\nget back to Glasgow as fast as we could; for, though to be sure it cost\nus a power of money coming down, yet, thinks we, the first loss is the\nbest.'\n\n'What would I have given,' cried Miss Julia, turning up the whites of\nher eyes, 'to have been permitted to mingle my sighs with the mountain\nbreezes!' Mrs Jones was accustomed to her sister's nonsense, and she\nonly shrugged her shoulders. But Mrs Dawkins, provoked that her daughter\nshould be so much more than usually ridiculous before a stranger, said,\n'Why, child, how can you be so silly,--what in the world should you do\nsighing o' top of a Scotch hill? I dare to say, if you were there you\nmight sigh long enough before you'd find such a comfortable cup of tea,\nas what you have in your hand.' Miss Julia disdained reply; but turning\nto our heroine, she addressed her in a tone so amusingly sentimental,\nthat Laura feared to listen to the purport of her speech, lest the\nmanner and the matter united should prove too much for her gravity; and\nrising, she apologized for retiring, by saying, that she heard her\nfather stir, and that she must attend him.\n\nWhen two people of very different ages meet t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate in a room, where\nthey are not thoroughly domesticated,--where there are no books, no\nmusical instruments, nor even that grand bond of sociality, a fire,--it\nrequires no common invention and vivacity to pass an evening with\ntolerable cheerfulness. The little appearances of discomfort, however,\nwhich imperceptibly lower the spirits of others, had generally an\nopposite effect upon those of Laura. Attentive to the comfort of every\nhuman being who approached her, she was always the first to discover the\nexistence and cause of the 'petty miseries of life;'--but, accustomed to\nconsider them merely as calls to exertion, they made not the slightest\nimpression on her spirits or temper. The moment she cast her eyes on her\nfather, leaning on a table, where stood a pair of candles, that but\nhalf-lighted the room; and on the chimney, where faded fennel occupied\nthe place of a fire, she perceived that all her efforts would be\nnecessary to produce any thing like comfort. She began her operations,\nby enticing her father out of the large vacant room, into the small one,\nwhere she intended to work. Here she prepared his coffee, gave him\naccount of the party below stairs, read to him her letter to Mrs\nDouglas, and did and said every thing she could imagine to amuse him.\n\nWhen the efforts to entertain are entirely on one side, it is scarcely\nin human nature to continue them; and Laura was beginning to feel very\nblank, when it luckily occurred to her, that she had brought her little\nchess-board from Glenalbert. Away she flew, and in triumph produced this\ninfallible resort. The match was pretty equal. Captain Montreville had\nmore skill, Laura more resource; and she defended herself long and\nkeenly. At last she was within a move of being checkmated. But the move\nwas hers; and the Captain, in the heat of victory, overlooked a step by\nwhich the fortune of the game would have been reversed. Laura saw it,\nand eagerly extended her hand to the piece; but recollecting that there\nis something in the pride of man's nature that abhors to be beaten at\nchess by a lady, she suddenly desisted; and, sweeping her lily arm\nacross the board, 'Nay, now,' she cried, with a look of ineffable good\nnature, 'if you were to complete my defeat after all my hair-breadth\n'scapes, you could not be so unreasonable as to expect that I should\nkeep my temper.' 'And how dare you,' said Captain Montreville, in great\ngood humour with his supposed victory, 'deprive me at once of the\npleasures of novelty and of triumph?' By the help of this auxiliary, the\nevening passed pleasantly away; and, before another came, Laura had\nprovided for it the cheap luxury of some books from a circulating\nlibrary.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nFor the first fortnight after Captain Montreville's arrival in London,\nalmost every forenoon was spent in unavailing attempts to see Mr\nBaynard, whose illness, at the end of that time, had increased to such a\ndegree, as left no hope that he could soon be in a condition for\nattending to business. Harassed by suspense, and weary of waiting for an\ninterview which seemed every day more distant, Captain Montreville\nresolved to stay no longer for his agent's introduction to Mr Warren,\nbut to visit the young heir, and himself explain his errand. Having\nprocured Mr Warren's address from Mr Baynard's servants, he proceeded to\nPortland Street; and knocking at the door of a handsome house, was there\ninformed that Mr Warren was gone to Brighton, and was not expected to\nreturn for three weeks.\n\nCaptain Montreville had now no resource but to unfold his demands to Mr\nWarren in writing. He did so, stating his claims with all the simple\nenergy of truth; but no answer was returned. He fatigued himself and\nLaura in vain, with conjecturing the cause of this silence. He feared\nthat, though dictated by scrupulous politeness, his letter might have\ngiven offence. He imagined that it might have miscarried, or that Mr\nWarren might have left Brighton before it reached him. All his\nconjectures were, however, wide of the truth. The letter had given no\noffence, for it had never been read. It safely reached the person to\nwhom it was addressed, just as he was adding a finishing touch to the\ngraces of a huge silk handkerchief in which he had enveloped his chin,\npreparatory to the exhibition of his person, and of an elegant new\ncurricle upon the Steine. A single glance had convinced him that the\nletter was unworthy to encroach on this momentous concern--he had thrown\nit aside, intending to read it when he had nothing else to do, and had\nseen it no more, till on his return to London, he unrolled from it his\nbottle of esprit de rose, which his valet had wrapped in its folds.\n\nThe three wearisome weeks came to an end at last, as well as a fourth,\nwhich the attractions of Brighton prevailed on Mr Warren to add to his\nstay; and Captain Montreville, making another, almost hopeless, inquiry\nin Portland Street, was, to his great joy, admitted to the long desired\nconference. He found the young man in his nightgown, reclining on a\nsofa, intently studious of the _Sportsman's Magazine_, while he ever and\nanon refreshed himself for this his literary toil, by sipping a cup of\nchocolate. Being courteously invited to partake, the Captain began by\napologizing for his intrusion, but pleaded that his business was of such\na nature as to require a personal interview. At the mention of business,\nthe smile forsook its prescriptive station on the smooth face of Mr\nWarren. 'Oh pray pardon me, Sir,' said he, 'my agent manages all my\nmatters--I never meddle with business--I have really no head for it.\nHere, Du Moulin, give this gentleman Mr William's address.' 'Excuse me,\nSir,' said Captain Montreville. 'On this occasion I must entreat that\nyou will so far depart from your rule as to permit me to state my\nbusiness to you in person.' 'I assure you, Sir,' said the beau rising\nfrom his luxurious posture, 'I know nothing about business--the very\nname of it is to me the greatest bore in life;--it always reminds me of\nmy old dead uncle. The poor man could never talk of any thing but of\nbank-stock, the price of the best archangel tar, and the scarcity of\nhemp. Often did I wish the hemp had been cheap enough to make him apply\na little of it to his own use--but the old cock took wing at last\nwithout a halter, he, he, he.'\n\n'I shall endeavour to avoid these offensive subjects,' said Captain\nMontreville, smiling. 'The affair in which I wish to interest you, is\nless a case of law than of equity, and therefore I must beg permission\nto state it to your personal attention, as your agent might not think\nhimself at liberty to do me the justice which I may expect from you.'\n\nMr Warren at this moment recollected an indispensable engagement, and\nbegged that Captain Montreville would do him the favour to call another\ntime--secretly resolving not to admit him. 'I shall not detain you two\nminutes,' said the Captain; 'I shall in a few words state my request,\nand leave you to decide upon it when you are more at leisure.' 'Well,\nSir,' replied Mr Warren, with something between a sigh and an\nill-suppressed yawn, 'if it must be so.'--\n\n'About eighteen months ago,' resumed the Captain, 'my agent, Mr\nBaynard, paid \u00c2\u00a31500 to your late uncle, as the price of an annuity on my\ndaughter's life. The deed is now found to be informal, and Mr Williams\nhas refused to make any payment. Mr Baynard's disposition has prevented\nme from seeing him since my arrival in London; but I have no doubt that\nhe can produce a discharge for the price of the annuity; in which case,\nI presume you will allow the mistake in the deed to be rectified.'\n\n'Certainly, certainly,' said Mr Warren, who had transferred his thoughts\nfrom the subject of the conversation to the comparative merits of\nnankeen pantaloons and leather-breeches. 'But even if Mr Baynard should\nhave no document to produce,' continued Captain Montreville, 'may I not\nhope that you will instruct Mr Williams to examine, whether there are\nnot in Mr Warren's books, traces of the agreement for an annuity of \u00c2\u00a380,\nin the name of Laura Montreville?' 'Sir?' said Warren, whose ear caught\nthe tone of interrogation, though the meaning of the speaker had\nentirely escaped him. The Captain repeated his request. 'Oh, certainly I\nwill,' said the young man, who would have promised any thing to get rid\nof the subject. 'I hope the matter will be found to stand as you wish.\nAt all events, such a trifling sum can be of no sort of consequence.'\n'Pardon me, Sir,' said Captain Montreville, warmly, 'to me it is of the\ngreatest--should this trifle, as you are pleased to call it, be lost to\nme, my child must at my death be left to all the horrors, all the\ntemptations of want--temptations aggravated a thousand fold, by beauty\nand inexperience.' His last words awakened something like interest in\nthe drowsy soul of his hearer, who said, with the returning smile of\nself-complacency, 'Beauty, Sir, did you say? beauty is what I may call\nmy passion--a pretty girl is always sure of my sympathy and good\noffices. I shall call for Mr Williams this very day.' Captain\nMontreville bit his lip. 'Laura Montreville,' thought he, 'an object of\nsympathy to such a thing as thou!' He bowed, however, and, said, 'I\nhope, Sir, you will find, upon examination, that Miss Montreville's\nclaims rest upon your justice.' Then laying his address upon the table,\nhe took his leave, with an air perhaps a little too stately for one who\nhad come to ask a favour.\n\nHe returned home, however, much pleased with having at last met with\nWarren, and with having, as he imagined, put in train the business on\naccount of which he had performed so long a journey, and suffered so\nmuch uneasiness. He found Laura, too, in high spirits. She had just\ngiven the finishing touches to a picture on which she had been most\nbusily employed ever since her arrival in London. She had studied the\ncomposition, till her head ached with intensity of thought. She had\nlaboured the finishing with care unspeakable; and she now only waited\ntill her work could with safety be moved, to try the success of her\nproject for the attainment of wealth. Of this success she scarcely\nentertained a doubt. She was sensible, indeed, that the picture had many\nfaults, but not so many as that on which Mrs Douglas's visitor had fixed\nso high a price. Since painting the latter, she had improved in skill;\nand never had she bestowed such pains as on her present work. The\nstranger had said that the Scipio in Mrs Douglas's picture was\ninteresting. The Leonidas in this was much more so--she could not doubt\nit, for he resembled Hargrave. She had hoped the resemblance would be\napparent to no eye but her own. Her father, however, had noticed it, and\nLaura had tried to alter the head, but the Captain declared she had\nspoiled it. Laura thought so herself; and, after sketching a hundred\nregularly handsome countenances, could be satisfied with none that bore\nnot some affinity to her only standard of manly beauty.\n\nTo add to the pleasure with which Laura surveyed the completion of her\nlabours, she had that day received a letter from Mrs Douglas, in which\nmention was made of Hargrave.\n\nIn her first letters to Laura, Mrs Douglas had entirely avoided this\nsubject. Almost a month Laura had waited, with sickening impatience, for\nsome hint from which she might gather intelligence of Hargrave's\nmotions--in vain. Her friend had been provokingly determined to believe\nthat the subject was disagreeable to her correspondent. Laura at last\nventured to add, to one of her letters, a postscript, in which, without\nnaming the Colonel, she inquired whether the ---- regiment was still at\nPerth. She blushed as she glanced over this postscript. She thought it\nhad an air of contrivance and design. She was half tempted to destroy\nthe letter; but she could not prevail on herself to make a more direct\ninquiry; and to forbear making any was almost impossible. An answer had\nthis day arrived; and Laura read no part of it with such interest, as\nthat which, with seeming carelessness, informed her that the Colonel had\nbeen several times at the parsonage: and that Mrs Douglas understood\nfrom report, that he was soon to visit London.\n\nAgain and again did Laura read this passage, and ponder every word of it\nwith care. I am playing the fool, said she to herself, and laid the\nletter aside; took it up again to ascertain some particular expression,\nand again read the paragraph which spoke of Hargrave, and again paused\nupon his name. She was so employed when her father entered, and she made\nan instinctive motion to conceal the paper; but the next moment she held\nit out to him, saying, 'This is from Mrs Douglas.' 'Well, my love,' said\nthe Captain, 'if there are no secrets in it, read it to me. I delight in\nMrs Douglas's simple affectionate style.' Laura did as she was desired;\nbut when she reached the sentence which began with the name of Hargrave,\nshe blushed, hesitated for a moment, and then, passing over it, began\nthe next paragraph.\n\nWithout both caution and self-command, the most upright woman will be\nguilty of subterfuges, where love is in question. Men can talk of the\nobject of their affections--they find pleasure in confiding, in\ndescribing, in dwelling upon their passion--but the love of woman seeks\nconcealment. If she can talk of it, or even of any thing that leads to\nit, the fever is imaginary, or it is past. 'It is very strange,' said\nthe Captain, when Laura had concluded, 'that Mrs Douglas never mentions\nHargrave, when she knows what an interest I take in him.' Laura coloured\ncrimson, but remained silent. 'What do you think can be her reason?'\nasked the Captain. This was a question for which Laura could find no\nevasion short of actual deceit; and, with an effort far more painful\nthan that from which her little artifice had saved her, her lovely face\nand neck glowing with confusion, she said: 'She does mention--only I--I.\nPlease to read it yourself;' and she pointed it out to her father, who,\nprepared by her hesitation to expect something very particular, was\nsurprised to find the passage so unimportant. 'Why, Laura,' said he,\n'what was there to prevent you from reading this?' To this question\nLaura could make no reply; and the Captain, after gazing on her for some\nmoments in vain hope of an explanation, dismissed the subject, saying,\nwith a shrug of his shoulders, 'Well, well--women are creatures I don't\npretend to understand.'\n\nLaura had often and deeply reflected upon the propriety of confiding to\nher father her engagement with Hargrave. Vague as it was, she thought a\nparent had an indisputable right to be informed of it. Her promise too\nhad been conditional, and what judge so proper as her father to watch\nover the fulfilment of its conditions? What judge so proper as her\nfather to examine the character, and to inspect the conduct, of the man\nwho might one day become her husband? But, amidst all the train of\ndelightful visions which this thought conjured up, Laura felt that\nHargrave's conduct had been such as she could not endure that her\nfather should remember against his future son. Captain Montreville was\nnow at a distance from Hargrave. Before they could possibly meet, her\narguments, or her entreaties, might have so far prevailed over the\nsubsiding passions of her father, as to dissuade him from a fashionable\nvindication of her honour. But what was to restore her lover to his\npresent rank in the Captain's regard? What would blot from his\nrecollection the insult offered to his child? Without mention of that\ninsult, her tale must be almost unintelligible; and she was conscious\nthat, if she entered on the subject at all, her father's tenderness, or\nhis authority, might unlock every secret of her breast. The time when\nher engagement could produce any consequence was distant. Ere it\narrived, something unforeseen might possibly remove her difficulties;\nor, at the worst, she hoped that, before she permitted her father to\nweigh the fault of Hargrave, she should be able to balance against it\nthe exemplary propriety of his after conduct. She was not just satisfied\nwith this reasoning; but weaker considerations can dissuade us from what\nwe are strongly disinclined to do; and to unveiling her own partiality,\nor the unworthiness of its object, Laura's disinclination was extreme.\nShe determined therefore to put off the evil hour; and withdrew her\nfather's attention from the subject of the letter, by inquiring whether\nhe had seen Warren, and whether he had settled his business\nsatisfactorily? The Captain replied, that though it was not absolutely\nsettled, he hoped it was now in a fair way of being so; and informed her\nof Warren's promise. 'Yet,' added he, 'any one of a thousand trifles may\nmake such an animal forget or neglect the most important concern.' 'What\nsort of man did he seem?' inquired Laura. 'Man!' repeated the Captain,\ncontemptuously. 'Why, child, he is a creature entirely new to you. He\ntalks like a parrot, looks like a woman, dresses like a monkey, and\nsmells like a civet-cat. You might have lived at Glenalbert for half a\ncentury, without seeing such a creature.' 'I hope he will visit us,'\nsaid Laura, 'that we may not return home without seeing at least one of\nthe curiosities of London.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nThe next day, as Captain Montreville sat reading aloud to his daughter,\nwho was busy with her needle, Mr Warren was announced.\n\nLaura, who concluded that he had business with her father, rose to\nretire; but her visitor, intercepting her, took both her hands, saying,\n'Pray, Ma'am, don't let me frighten you away.' With a constitutional\ndislike to familiarity, Laura coolly disengaged herself, and left the\nroom, without uttering a syllable; but not before Warren had seen enough\nof her to determine, that, if possible, he should see her again. He was\nstruck with her extraordinary beauty, which was heightened by the little\nhectic his forwardness had called to her cheek; and he prolonged his\nvisit to an unfashionable length, in the hope of her return. He went\nover all the topics which he judged proper for the ear of a stranger of\nhis own sex;--talked of the weather, the news, the emptiness of the\ntown, of horses, ladies, cock-fights, and boxing-matches. He informed\nthe Captain, that he had given directions to his agent to examine into\nthe state of the annuity; inquired how long Miss Montreville was to\ngrace London with her presence; and was told that she was to leave it\nthe moment her father could settle the business, on account of which\nalone he had left Scotland. When it was absolutely necessary to conclude\nhis visit, Mr Warren begged permission to repeat it, that he might\nacquaint Captain Montreville with the success of his agent; secretly\nhoping, that Laura would another time be less inaccessible.\n\nLaura meanwhile thought his visit would never have an end. Having\nwandered into every room to which she had access, and found rest in none\nof them, she concluded, rather rashly, that she should find more comfort\nin the one from which his presence excluded her. That disease of the\nmind in which by eager anticipations of the future many are unfitted\nfor present enjoyment, was new to the active spirit of Laura. The\nhappiness of her life, (and in spite of the caprices of her mother, it\nhad, upon the whole, been a happy one), had chiefly arisen from a\nconstant succession of regular, but varied pursuits. The methodical\nsequence of domestic usefulness, and improving study, and healthful\nexercise, afforded calm yet immediate enjoyment; and the future pleasure\nwhich they promised was of that indefinite and progressive kind which\nprovokes no eager desires, no impatient expectation. Laura, therefore,\nhad scarcely known what it was to long for the morrow; but on this day,\nthe morrow was anticipated with wishful solicitude,--a solicitude which\nbanished from her mind even the thoughts of Hargrave. Never did youthful\nbridegroom look forward to his nuptial hour with more ardour, than did\nLaura to that which was to begin the realization of her prospects of\nwealth and independence. The next day was to be devoted to the sale of\nher picture. Her father was on that day to visit Mr Baynard at Richmond,\nwhither he had been removed for the benefit of a purer air; and she\nhoped on his return, to surprize her beloved parent with an unlooked-for\ntreasure. She imagined the satisfaction with which she should spread\nbefore him her newly acquired riches,--the pleasure with which she would\nlisten to his praises of her diligence;--above all, her fancy dwelt on\nthe delight which she should feel in relieving her father from the\npecuniary embarrassment, in which she knew him to be involved by a\nresidence in London so much longer than he had been prepared to expect.\n\nThat she might add to her intended gift the pleasure of surprize, she\nwas resolved not to mention her plan for to-morrow; and with such\nsubjects in contemplation, how could she rest,--of what other subject\ncould she speak? She tried to banish it from her mind, that she might\nnot be wholly unentertaining to her father, who, on her account, usually\nspent his evenings at home. But the task of amusing was so laborious,\nthat she was glad to receive in it even the humble assistance of Miss\nJulia Dawkins.\n\nThis young lady had thought it incumbent on her to assault our heroine\nwith a most violent friendship; a sentiment which often made her\nsufficiently impertinent, though it was a little kept in check by the\ncalm good sense and natural reserve of Laura. The preposterous\naffectation of Julia sometimes provoked the smiles, but more frequently\nthe pity of Laura; for her real good nature could find no pleasure in\nseeing human beings make themselves ridiculous, and she applied to the\ncure of Miss Dawkins's foibles, the ingenuity which many would have\nemployed to extract amusement from them. She soon found, however, that\nshe was combating a sort of Hydra, from which, if she succeeded in\nlopping off one excrescence, another was instantly ready to sprout.\nHaving no character of her own, Julia was always, as nearly as she was\nable, the heroine whom the last read novel inclined her to personate.\nBut as those who forsake the guidance of nature are in imminent danger\nof absurdity, her copies were always caricatures. After reading Evelina,\nshe sat with her mouth extended in a perpetual smile, and was so very\ntimid, that she would not for the world have looked at a stranger. When\nCamilla was the model for the day, she became insufferably rattling,\ninfantine, and thoughtless. After perusing the Gossip's story, she, in\nimitation of the rational Louisa, suddenly waxed very wise--spoke in\nsentences--despised romances--sewed shifts--and read sermons. But, in\nthe midst of this fit, she, in an evil hour, opened a volume of the\nNouvelle Eloise, which had before disturbed many wiser heads. The shifts\nwere left unfinished, the sermons thrown aside, and Miss Julia returned\nwith renewed _impetus_ to the sentimental. This afternoon her studies\nhad changed their direction, as Laura instantly guessed by the lively\nair with which she entered the room, saying that she had brought her\nnetting, and would sit with her for an hour. 'But do, my dear,' added\nshe, 'first shew me the picture you have been so busy with; Mamma says\nit is beautiful, for she peeped in at it the other day.'\n\nIt must be confessed, that Laura had no high opinion of Miss Dawkins's\nskill in painting; but she remembered Moliere's old woman, and went with\ngreat good will to bring her performance. 'Oh charming,' exclaimed Miss\nJulia, when it was placed before her; 'the figure of the man is quite\ndelightful; it is the very image of that bewitching creature Tom Jones.'\n'Tom Jones?' cried Laura, starting back aghast. 'Yes, my dear,'\ncontinued Julia; 'just such must have been the graceful turn of his\nlimbs--just such his hair, his eyes, those lips, that when they touched\nher hand, put poor Sophia into such a flutter.' The astonishment of\nLaura now gave way to laughter, while she said, 'Really Miss Dawkins you\nmust have a strange idea of Tom Jones, or I a very extraordinary one of\nLeonidas.' 'Leonce, you mean, in Delphine,' said Julia; 'Oh, he is a\ndelightful creature too.' 'Delphine!' repeated Laura, to whom the name\nwas as new as that of the Spartan was to her companion. 'No, I mean this\nfor the Greek general taking his last leave of his wife.' 'And I\nthink,' said Captain Montreville, approaching the picture, 'the\nsuppressed anguish of the matron is admirably expressed, and contrasts\nwell with the scarcely relenting ardour of the hero.' Miss Julia again\ndeclared, that the picture was charming, and that Leontine, as she was\npleased to call him, was divinely handsome; but having newly replenished\nher otherwise empty head with Fielding's novel, she could talk of\nnothing else; and turning to Laura said, 'But why were you so offended,\nthat I compared your Leontine to Tom Jones?--Is he not a favourite of\nyours?' 'Not particularly so,' said Laura. 'Oh why not?--I am sure he is\na delightful fellow--so generous--so ardent. Come, confess--should you\nnot like of all things to have such a lover?' 'No, indeed,' said Laura,\nwith most unusual energy; for her thoughts almost unconsciously turned\nto one whose character she found no pleasure in associating with that of\nFielding's hero. 'And why not?' asked Miss Julia. 'Because,' answered\nLaura, 'I could not admire in a lover qualities which would be odious in\na husband.' 'Oh goodness!' cried Miss Julia, 'do you think Tom Jones\nwould make an odious husband?' 'The term is a little strong,' replied\nLaura; 'but he certainly would not make a pleasant yoke-fellow. What is\nyour opinion, Sir?' turning to her father. 'I confess,' said the\nCaptain, 'I should rather have wished him to marry Squire Western's\ndaughter than mine. But still the character is fitted to be popular.' 'I\nthink,' said Laura, 'he is indebted for much of the toleration which he\nreceives, to a comparison with the despicable Blifil.' 'Certainly,' said\nthe Captain; 'and it is unfortunate for the morality of the book, that\nthe reader is inclined to excuse the want of religion in the hero, by\nseeing its language made ridiculous in Thwackum, and villanous in\nBlifil. Even the excellent Mr Alworthy excites but feeble interest; and\nit is not by the character which we respect, but by that in which we are\ninterested, that the moral effect on our minds is produced.' 'Oh,' said\nMiss Julia, who very imperfectly comprehended the Captain's observation,\n'he might make a charming husband without being religious; and then he\nis so warm-hearted--so generous.' 'I shall not dispute that point with\nyou just now,' replied Laura, 'though my opinion differs materially from\nyours; but Tom Jones's warmth of heart and generosity do not appear to\nme of that kind which quality a man for adorning domestic life. His\nseems a constitutional warmth, which in his case, and I believe, in most\nothers, is the concomitant of a warm temper,--a temper as little\nfavourable to gentleness in those who command, as to submission in\nthose who obey. If by generosity you mean the cheerful relinquishing of\nsomething which we really value, it is an abuse of the term to apply it\nto the profusion with which your favourite squanders his money.'\n\n'If it is not generous to part with one's money,' said Miss Julia, 'I am\nsure I don't know what is.'\n\n'The quiet domestic generosity which is of daily use,' replied Laura,\n'is happily not confined to those who have money to bestow;--but may\nappear in any of a thousand little acts of self-denial.' Julia, whose\nideas of generosity, culled from her favourite romances, were on that\ngigantic kind of scale that makes it unfit for common occasions, and\ntherefore in danger of total extinction, was silent for some moments,\nand then said, 'I am sure you must allow that it was very noble in Jones\nto bury in his own miserable bosom his passion for Sophia, after he knew\nthat she felt a mutual flame.' 'If I recollect right,' said Laura,\nsmiling at the oddity of Julia's phrases, 'he broke that resolution; and\nI fancy the merely _resolving_ to do right, is a degree of virtue, to\nwhich even the most profligate attain many times in their lives.'\n\nMiss Dawkins, by this time more than half-suspected her companion of\nbeing a Methodist. 'You have such strict notions,' said she, 'that I see\nTom Jones would never have done for you.' 'No,' said Captain\nMontreville, 'Sir Charles Grandison would have suited Laura infinitely\nbetter.' 'Oh no, papa,' said Laura, laughing; 'if two such formal\npersonages as Sir Charles and I had met, I am afraid we should never\nhave had the honour of each other's acquaintance.'\n\n'Then, of all the gentlemen who are mentioned in novels,' said Miss\nJulia, 'tell me who is your favourite?--Is it Lord Orville, or Delville,\nor Valancourt, or Edward, or Mortimer, or Peregrine Pickle, or'--and she\nran on till she was quite out of breath, repeating what sounded like a\npage of the catalogue of a circulating library.\n\n'Really,' said Laura, when a pause permitted her to speak, 'my\nacquaintance with these accomplished persons is so limited that I can\nscarcely venture to decide; but, I believe, I prefer the hero of Miss\nPorter's new publication--Thaddeus of Warsaw. Truly generous, and\ninflexibly upright, his very tenderness has in it something manly and\nrespectable; and the whole combination has an air of nature that\ninterests one as for a real friend.' Miss Dawkins had never read the\nbook, and Laura applied to her father for a confirmation of her opinion.\n'Yes, my dear,' said the Captain, 'your favourite has the same\nresemblance to a human character which the Belvidere Appollo has to a\nhuman form. It is so like man that one cannot absolutely call it divine,\nyet so perfect, that it is difficult to believe it human.'\n\nAt this moment Miss Julia was seized with an uncontrollable desire to\nread the book, which, she declared, she should not sleep till she had\ndone; and she went to dispatch a servant in quest of it.\n\nLaura followed her down stairs, to ask from Mrs Dawkins a direction to a\npicture-dealer, to whom she might dispose of her performance. Mrs\nDawkins said she knew of no such person; but directed Laura to a\nprintshop, the master of which was her acquaintance, where she might get\nthe intelligence she wanted.\n\nOn the following morning, as soon as Captain Montreville had set out for\nRichmond, his daughter, sending for a hackney coach, departed on the\nmost interesting business she had ever undertaken. Her heart fluttered\nwith expectation--her step was buoyant with hope, and she sprung into\nthe carriage with the lightness of a sylph. Stopping at the shop which\nher landlady recommended, she was there directed to several of the\nprofessional people for whom she was enquiring, and she proceeded to the\nhabitation of the nearest. As she entered the house, Laura changed\ncolour, and her breath came quick. She stopped a moment to recover\nherself, and then followed her conductor into the presence of the\nconnoisseur. Struck with the sight of so elegant a woman, he rose, bowed\nvery low, and supposing that she came to make some addition to her\ncabinet, threw open the door of his picture-room, and obsequiously hoped\nthat she might find something there worthy of her attention. Laura\nmodestly undeceived him, saying, that she had brought in the carriage\nwhich waited for her, a picture which she wished to dispose of. This\nstatement instantly put to flight the servility of her hearer; who, with\ncompletely recovered consequence, inquired the name of the artist; and\nbeing answered, that the picture was not the work of a professional man,\nwrinkled his nose into an expression of ineffable contempt, and said--'I\nmake it a rule never to buy any of these things--they are generally such\nvile daubs. However to oblige so pretty a lady,' added he, (softening\nhis contumelious aspect into a leer), 'I may look at the thing, and if\nit is at all tolerable'--'There is no occasion to give you that\ntrouble,' said Laura, turning away with an air which again half\nconvinced the man that she must be a person of consequence. He muttered\nsomething of 'thinking it no trouble;' to which she gave no attention,\nbut hastened to her carriage, and ordered the coachman to drive to the\nshow-room of an Italian.\n\nLaura did not give him time to fall into the mistake of the other, but\ninstantly opened her business; and Mr Sonini was obligingly running\nhimself to lift the picture from the carriage, when it was brought in by\nMrs Dawkins' maid, whom Laura had requested to attend her. Having placed\nthe picture, the Italian retreated a few paces to examine the effect,\nand then said--'Ah! I do see--dis is leetle after de manner of\nCorreggio--very pretty--very pretty, indeed.' The hopes of Laura rose\nhigh at these encouraging words; but suffered instantaneous depression,\nwhen he continued, with a shake of his head, 'but 'tis too new--quite\nmoderne--painted in dis contri.--Painter no name--de picture may be all\nso good as it vil--it never vil sell. Me sorry,' added he, reading\nLaura's look of disappointment, 'me sorry displease such bell angela;\nbut cannot buy.' 'I am sorry for it,' said Laura, and sighing heavily,\nshe courtesied and withdrew.\n\nHer next attempt was upon a little pert-looking man, in a foreign dress,\nand spectacles. 'Hum,' said he, 'a picture to sell--well, let us\nsee't.--There, that's the light. Hum--a poor thing enough--no\nkeeping--no cost\u00c3\u00bbme. Well, Ma'am, what do you please to ask for this?'\n'I should be glad, Sir, that you would fix a price on it.'\n'Hum--well--let me think--I suppose five guineas will be very fair.' At\nthis proposal, the blood mounted to the cheeks of Laura; and she raised\nher eyes to examine whether the proposer really had the confidence to\nlook her in the face. But finding his eye steadily fixed on her, she\ntransferred her suspicions from the honesty of the bidder to the merits\nof her piece, and mildly answering, 'I shall not, I think, be disposed\nto part with it at that price,' she motioned to the servant to carry it\nback to the coach.\n\nOne trial still remained; and Laura ordered her carriage to an obscure\nstreet in the city. She was very politely received by Mr Collins,--a\nyoung man who had himself been an artist; but whom bad health had\nobliged to relinquish a profession which he loved. 'This piece has\ncertainly great merit,' said he, after examining it, 'and most gladly\nwould I have made the purchase; but my little room is at present\noverstocked, and, to own the truth to you, the picture is worth more\nthan my wife and four little ones can afford to venture upon\nspeculation, and such is the purchase of the work, however meritorious,\nof an unknown artist. But if you were to place it in the exhibition, I\nhave no doubt that it would speedily find a purchaser.' The prospect\nwhich the Exhibition held forth, was far too distant to meet the present\nexigency; for Laura well knew that her father would find almost\nimmediate occasion for the price of her labours; and with a heavy sigh\nshe returned to her carriage.\n\nWhat now remained but to return home with the subject of so much\nfruitless toil. Still, however, she determined to make one effort more,\nand returned to inquire of the printseller, whether he knew any other\nperson to whom she could apply? He had before given his whole list, and\ncould make no addition to it. But observing the expression of blank\ndisappointment which overcast her face, he offered, if she would trust\nhim with the picture, to place it where it would be seen by his\ncustomers, and expressed a belief that some of them might purchase it.\nLaura thankfully accepted the offer, and after depositing with him her\ntreasure, which had lost much of its value in her eyes, and naming the\nprice she expected, she returned home; making on her way as many\nsombrous reflections on the vanity and uncertainty of all sublunary\npursuits, as ever were made by any young lady in her eighteenth year.\n\nShe sat down in her now solitary parlour--suffered dinner to be placed\nbefore her and removed, without knowing of what it consisted; and when\nthe servant who brought it disappeared, began, like a true heroine, to\nvent her disappointment in tears. But soon recollecting that, though she\nhad no joyful surprize awaiting her father, she might yet gladden it\nwith a smiling welcome, she started up from her melancholy\nposture--bathed her eyes--placed the tea equipage--ordered the first\nfire of the season to displace the faded fennel in the chimney--arranged\nthe apartment in the nicest order--and had just given to everything the\ngreatest possible appearance of comfort, when her father arrived. She\nhad need, however, of all her firmness, and of all the elation of\nconscious self-control, to resist the contagious depression of\ncountenance and manner with which Captain Montreville accosted her. He\nhad good reason for his melancholy. Mr Baynard, his early acquaintance,\nalmost the only person known to him in this vast city, had that morning\nbreathed his last. All access to his papers was of course at present\nimpossible; and until a person could be chosen to arrange his affairs,\nit would be impracticable for Captain Montreville to ascertain whether\nthere existed any voucher for the payment of the price of the annuity.\nHarassed by his repeated disappointments, and unendowed by nature with\nthe unbending spirit that rises in disaster, he now declared to Laura\nhis resolution to remain in London only till a person was fixed upon for\nthe management of Mr Baynard's affairs--to lay before him the\ncircumstances of his case--and then to return to Scotland, and trust to\na correspondence for concluding the business.\n\nAt this moment nothing could have been further from Laura's wish than to\nquit London. She was unwilling to forfeit her remaining hope that her\npicture might find a purchaser, and a still stronger interest bound her\nto the place which was so soon to be the residence of Hargrave. But she\nsaw the prudence of her father's determination--she felt the necessity\nof relinquishing a mode of life so unsuitable to his scanty income, and\nshe cheerfully acquiesced in his proposal of returning home. Still some\ntime must elapse, before their departure; and she indulged a hope, that\nere that time expired, the produce of her labours might lighten their\npecuniary difficulties.\n\nCaptain Montreville retired early; and Laura, wearied out with the toils\nand the disappointments of the day, gladly resigned herself to the sleep\nof innocence.\n\nLaura was indebted partly to nature, but more to her own exertion, for\nthat happy elasticity of spirit which easily casts off lighter evil,\nwhile it readily seizes, and fully enjoys, pleasure of moderate\nintensity, and of frequent attainment. Few of the lesser sorrows of\nyouth can resist the cheering influence of early morn; and the petty\nmiseries which, in the shades of evening, assume portentous size and\ncolour, diminish wonderfully in the light of the new-risen sun. With\nrecovered spirits, and reviving hopes, Laura awoke to joys which the\nworldly know not,--the joys of pious gratitude--of devout\ncontemplation--of useful employment; and so far was her persevering\nspirit from failing under the disappointments of the preceding day, that\nshe determined to begin a new picture from the moment she was settled at\nGlenalbert, to compose it with more care, and finish it with greater\naccuracy, than the former; and to try its fate at the exhibition. She\ndid not think the season of her father's depression a fit one for\nrelating her mortifying adventures, and she found means to amuse him\nwith other topics till he left her, with an intention to call in\nPortland Street.\n\nHe had not been gone long, when Mr Warren's curricle stopped at the\ndoor, and the young gentleman, on being informed that the Captain was\nabroad, inquired for Miss Montreville. After paying his compliments like\none secure of a good reception, he began--'How could you be so cruel as\nto refuse me the pleasure of seeing you the other day--do you know I\nwaited here a devilish long time just on purpose, though I had promised\nto take the Countess of Bellamer out an airing, and she was off with\nJack Villars before I came.' 'I am sorry,' said Laura, 'that I deprived\nher Ladyship of your company.' 'I should not have minded it much, if you\nhad but come at last--though the Countess is the prettiest creature in\nLondon--curse me if she isn't--the present company always excepted.' 'Do\nyou mean the exception for me, or for yourself?' said Laura. 'Oh now,\nhow can you ask such a question?--I am sure you know that you are\nconfoundedly handsome.' Laura gravely surveyed her own face in an\nopposite looking-glass, and then, with the nonchalance of one who talks\nof the most indifferent thing in nature, replied,--'Yes, I think my\nfeatures are uncommonly regular.' Warren was a little embarrassed by so\nunusual an answer to what he intended for a compliment. 'The girl,'\nthought he, 'must be quite a fool to own that she thinks herself so\nhandsome.' However, after some consideration, he said,--'It is not so\nmuch the features, as a certain _je ne s\u00c3\u00a7ai quoi_--a certain charm--one\ndoes not know well what to call it, that makes you look so divine.' 'I\nshould suppose,' said Laura, 'from the subject you have chosen to amuse\nme, that the charm, whatever it is, has no great connection with\nintellect.' Warren hesitated; for he began to have some suspicions that\nshe was laughing at him, in spite of the immoveable gravity of her\ncountenance. 'It--it isn't--Demme, it isn't so much to amuse you; but\nwhen I see a pretty woman, I never can help telling her of it--curse me\nif I can.' 'And do you often find that your intelligence has the\nadvantage of novelty?' said Laura; an arch smile beginning to dimple her\ncheek. 'No, 'pon honour,' replied the beau, 'the women are getting so\ninsufferably conceited, they leave one nothing new to tell them.' 'But\nsome gentlemen,' said Laura, 'have the happy talent of saying old things\nso well, that the want of novelty is not felt.' The moment the words had\npassed her lips, she perceived, by the gracious smile which they\nproduced, that Mr Warren had applied them to himself; and the thought of\nbeing guilty of such egregious flattery, brought the colour to her face.\nAny explanation, however, would have been actual rudeness; and while the\nconsciousness of her involuntary duplicity kept her silent, her\ncompanion enjoyed her confusion; which, together with the compliment, he\ninterpreted in a way most satisfactory to his vanity, and thankfully\nrepaid with a torrent of praises in his very best style.\n\nSo little value did Laura affix to his commendations, that she was\nbeginning to find extreme difficulty in suppressing a yawn, when it\noccurred to her that it might save her father a journey to Portland\nStreet, if she could detain Mr Warren till he arrived. Having made an\nobservation, which has been more frequently made than profited by, that\nmost people prefer talking to listening, she engaged her companion in a\ndescription of some of the fashionable places of public resort, none of\nwhich she had seen; in which he acquitted himself so much to his own\nsatisfaction, that, before they separated, he was convinced that Laura\nwas one of the most penetrating judicious women of his acquaintance; and\nhaving before remarked, that, with the help of a little rouge, and a\nfashionable riding-habit, she would look better in a curricle than any\nwoman in London, he resolved, that if it depended on him, her residence\nin town should not be a short one. In this laudable resolution, he was\nconfirmed by a consideration of the insolence and extravagance of a\ncertain female, to whose place in his establishment he had some vague\nidea of advancing Miss Laura, though there was a stateliness about both\nher and her father, which he suspected might somewhat interfere with his\ndesigns in her favour. Soon after the Captain arrived, he took his\nleave, having no new intelligence to communicate, nor indeed any other\npurpose in his visit, except that which had been served by his interview\nwith Laura.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, Laura went down stairs to beg that Miss Dawkins\nwould accompany her after dinner to the print-shop, to inquire what had\nbeen the fate of her picture. More than one person, she was told, had\nadmired it, and expressed a desire to become the owner; but the price\nhad been a formidable obstacle, and it remained unsold.\n\nAlmost every evening did Laura, with Mrs Dawkins or her daughter for an\nescort, direct her steps to the print-shop, and return from her\nfruitless walk with fainter and fainter hope.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nMontague de Courcy had dined t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate with an old uncle from whom he\nhad no expectations, and was returning home to sup quietly with his\nmother and sister, when his progress was arrested by a group occupying\nthe whole breadth of the pavement, and he heard a female voice which,\nthough unusually musical, had in it less of entreaty than of command,\nsay, 'Pray, Sir, allow us to pass.' 'Not till I have seen the face that\nbelongs to such a figure,' answered one of a party of young men who were\nrudely obstructing the passage of the lady who had spoken. With this\ncondition, however, she seemed not to intend compliance, for she had\ndoubled her veil, and pertinaciously resisted the attempts of her\npersecutors to raise it.\n\nDe Courcy had a rooted antipathy to all manner of violence and\noppression, especially when exercised against the more defenceless part\nof the creation; and he no sooner ascertained these circumstances, than,\nwith one thrust of his muscular arm, (which, to say the truth, was more\nthan a match for half a dozen of the puny fry of sloth and\nintemperance), he opened a passage for the lady and her companion;\nsteadily detained her tormentors till she made good her retreat; and\nthen, leaving the gentlemen to answer, as they best could, to their own\ninterrogatories of 'What do you mean?' and 'Who the d--l are you?' he\nfollowed the rescued damsel, with whose appearance, considering the\nplace and the hour, he was extremely surprised.\n\nHer height, which certainly rose about the beautiful, perhaps even\nexceeded the majestic; her figure, though slender, was admirably\nproportioned, and had all the appropriate roundness of the feminine\nform; her dress, though simple, and of matronly decency, was not\nunfashionable; while the dignity of her gait, and the composure of her\nmotion, suited well with the majesty of her stature and mien.\n\nWhile De Courcy was making these observations, he had offered the lady\nhis arm, which she accepted, and his escort home, which she declined,\nsaying, that she would take refuge in a shop, till a coach could be\nprocured. Nor was he less attentive to her companion, although the\nlatter was a little, elderly, vulgar-looking woman, imperfections which\nwould have utterly disqualified her for the civility of many a polite\ngentleman.\n\nThis person had no sooner recovered the breath of which her supposed\ndanger, and the speed of her rescue from it had deprived her, than she\nbegan, with extreme volubility, to comment on her adventure. 'Well,' she\ncried, 'if that was not the forwardest thing ever I seed. I am sure I\nhave comed home afore now of an evening a matter of five hunder times,\nand never met with no such thing in my life. But its all along of my\nbeing so saving of your money; for I might have took a coach as you'd\nhave had me: but its no longer ago nor last week, as I comed from my\ntea, at that very Mr Wilkins's, later nor this, and nobody so much as\nspoke to me; but catch me penny wise again. Howsoever, it's partlins\nyour own doings; for if you hadn't staid so long a-looking at the\npictures in the shop we shouldn't have met with them there men.\nHowsoever, Miss Montreville, you did right enough not to let that there\njackanapes see your face, otherwise we mightn't have got off from them\nfellors tonight.'\n\nThe curiosity of De Courcy thus directed, overcame his habitual dislike\nto staring, and rivetted his eyes on a face, which, once seen, was\ndestined never to be forgotten. Her luxuriant hair, (which De Courcy at\nfirst thought black, though he afterwards corrected this opinion), was\ncarelessly divided on a forehead, whose spotless whiteness was varied\nonly by the blue of a vein that shone through the transparent skin. As\nshe raised her mild religious dark grey eyes, their silken lashes rested\non the well-defined but delicate eye-brow; or, when her glance fell\nbefore the gaze of admiration, threw a long shade on a cheek of\nunequalled beauty, both for form and colour. The contour of her\nfeatures, inclining to the Roman, might perhaps have been called\nmasculine, had it not been softened to the sweetest model of maiden\nloveliness, by the delicacy of its size and colouring. The glowing\nscarlet of the lips, formed a contrast with a complexion\nconstitutionally pale, but varying every moment; while round her easily\nbut firmly closing mouth, lurked not a trace of the sensual or the vain,\nbut all was calm benevolence, and saintly purity. In the contemplation\nof a countenance, the perfect symmetry of which was its meanest charm,\nDe Courcy, who was a physiognomist, suffered the stream of time, as well\nas that of Mrs Dawkins's eloquence, to flow on without notice, and first\nbecame sensible that he had profited by neither, when the shop-boy\nannounced that the carriage was at the door. While handing the ladies\ninto the carriage, De Courcy again offered his attendance, which Laura,\ngracefully thanking him for his attentions, again declined; and they\ndrove off just as he was about to inquire where they chose to be set\ndown.\n\nNow, whether it was that Laura was offended at De Courcy's inspection of\nher face, or whether she saw any thing disagreeable in his; whether it\nwas that her pride disdained lodgings in Holborn, or that she desired\nnot to be recognized by one who had met with her in such a situation,\ncertain it is, that she chose the moment when that gentleman was placing\nher voluble companion in the coach, to give the coachman her directions,\nin sounds that escaped the ears of De Courcy. As he had no means of\nremedying this misfortune, he walked home, and philosophically\nendeavoured to forget it in a game at chess with his mother. The\nfidelity of a historian, however, obliges us to confess, that he this\nevening played in a manner that would have disgraced a school-boy. After\nmistaking his antagonist's men for his own, playing into check, throwing\naway his pieces, and making false moves, he answered his mother's\nquestion of 'Montague, what are you doing?', by pushing back his chair,\nand exclaiming, 'Mother, you never beheld such a woman.'\n\n'Woman!' repeated Mrs De Courcy, settling her spectacles, and looking\nhim full in the face. 'Woman!' said his sister, laying down Bruyere,\n'Who is she?'\n\n'I know not,' answered De Courcy, 'but had Lavater seen her, he could\nscarcely have believed her human.'\n\n'What is her name?'\n\n'The woman who attended her called her Montreville.'\n\n'Where did you meet her?'\n\n'In the street.'\n\n'In the street!' cried Harriet, laughing. 'Oh, Montague, that is not\nhalf sentimental enough for you. You should have found her all in a\nshady bower, playing on a harp that came there nobody knows how; or, all\nelegant in India muslin, dandling a beggar's brat in a dirty cottage.\nBut let us hear the whole adventure.'\n\n'I have already told you all I know,' answered De Courcy. 'Now, Madam,\nwill you give me my revenge.' 'No, no,' said Mrs De Courcy, 'I will play\nno more; I should have no glory in conquering such a defenceless enemy.'\n'Well, then,' said Montague, good-humouredly, 'give me leave to read to\nyou, for I would rather amuse you and Harriet in any other way than by\nsitting quietly to be laughed at.'\n\nAfter the ladies had retired for the night, De Courcy meditated for full\nfive minutes on the descent from Laura Montreville's forehead to her\nnose, and bestowed a proportionable degree of consideration upon other\nlines in her physiognomy; but it must be confessed, that by the time he\narrived at the dimple in her left cheek, he had forgotten both Lavater\nand his opinions, and that his recollection of her mouth was somewhat\nconfused by that of her parting smile, which he more than once declared\naloud to himself was 'heavenly.' We are credibly informed, that he\nrepeated the same expression three times in his sleep; and whether it\nwas that his dreams reminded him of Mrs Dawkins's eloquence, or whether\nhis memory was refreshed by his slumbers, he had not been long awake\nbefore he recollected that he had heard that lady mention a Mr Wilkins,\nand hint that he kept a print-shop. By a proper application to the\nLondon directory, he easily discovered the print-seller's abode, and\nthither he that very day repaired.\n\nMr Wilkins was not in the shop when De Courcy entered it, but the\nshop-boy said his master would be there in a minute. This minute\nappearing to De Courcy of unusual length, he, to while it away, began to\nexamine the prints which hung around. His eye was presently attracted by\nthe only oil picture in the shop; and his attention was fixed by\nobserving, that it presented a striking resemblance of his old\nschool-fellow Hargrave. He turned to make some inquiry of the shop-boy,\nwhen Mr Wilkins came in, and his interest reverted to a different\nobject. The question, however, which he had come to ask, and which to\nask would have three minutes before appeared the simplest thing in the\nworld, now faltered on his tongue; and it was not without something like\nhesitation, that he inquired whether Mr Wilkins knew a Miss Montreville.\nDesirous to oblige a person of De Courcy's appearance, Wilkins\nimmediately related all that he knew of Laura, either from his own\nobservation, or from the report of her loquacious landlady; and\nperceiving that he was listened to with attention, he proceeded further\nto detail his conjectures. 'This picture is painted by her,' said he,\n'and I rather think the old Captain can't be very rich, she seemed so\nanxious to have it sold.' De Courcy again turned to the picture, which\nhe had before examined, and on this second inspection, was so fortunate\nas to discover that it bore the stamp of great genius,--an opinion in\nwhich, we believe, he would have been joined by any man of\nfour-and-twenty who had seen the artist. 'So,' thought he, 'this lovely\ncreature's genius is equal to her beauty, and her worth perhaps\nsurpasses both; for she has the courage to rise superior to the silly\ncustoms of the world, and can dare to be useful to herself and to\nothers. I knew by the noble arching of her forehead, that she was above\nall vulgar prejudice:' and he admired Laura the more for being a\nfavourable instance of his own penetration,--a feeling so natural, that\nit lessens even our enmity to the wicked, when we ourselves have\npredicted their vices. It must be owned, that De Courcy was a little\nhasty in his judgment of Laura's worth; but the sight of such a face as\nhers, gives great speed to a young man's decision upon female character.\nHe instantly purchased the picture, and recollecting that it is highly\nproper to patronize genius and industry, he desired Mr Wilkins to beg\nthat a companion might be painted. He then returned home, leaving orders\nthat his purchase should follow him immediately.\n\nThough nature, a private education, and studious habits, made De Courcy\nrather reserved to strangers, he was, in his domestic circle, one of the\nmost communicative persons in the world; and the moment he saw his\nmother, he began to inform her of the discoveries he had made that\nmorning. 'Montreville!' said Mrs De Courcy, when he had ended, 'can that\nbe William Montreville who was in the ---- regiment when your father was\nthe major of it?' 'Most likely he is,' said Montague, eagerly. 'Many a\ntime did he hold you upon his horse, and many a paper kite did he make\nfor you.' 'It must be the same,' said Montague; 'the name is not a\ncommon one; it certainly must be the same.' 'I can hardly believe it,'\nsaid Mrs De Courcy; 'William Montreville married that strange imprudent\nwoman, Lady Harriet Bircham. Poor Montreville!--he deserved a better\nwife.' 'It cannot be he,' said De Courcy, sorrowfully; 'no such woman\ncould be the mother of Miss Montreville.' 'He settled in Scotland\nimmediately after his marriage,' continued Mrs De Courcy, 'and since\nthat time I have never heard of him.' 'It is the same then,' said\nMontague, his countenance lightening with pleasure, 'for Miss\nMontreville is a Scotch woman. I remember his kindness. I think I almost\nrecollect his face. He used to set me on his knee and sing to me; and\nwhen he sung the Babes in the Woods, I pretended to go to sleep on his\nbosom, for I thought it not manly to cry; but when I looked up, I saw\nthe tears standing in his own eyes. I will go and see my old friend this\nvery hour.' 'You have forgotten,' said Mrs De Courcy, 'that you promised\nto escort Harriet to the park, and she will be disappointed if you\nengage yourself elsewhere.' De Courcy, who would have postponed any\npersonal gratification rather than disappoint the meanest servant in his\nhousehold, instantly agreed to defer his visit; and as it had never\noccurred to him that the claims of relationship were incompatible with\nthose of politeness, he did not once during their walk insinuate to his\nsister that he would have preferred another engagement.\n\nNever had he, either as a physiognomist or as a man, admired any woman\nso much as he did Laura; yet her charms were no longer his only, or even\nhis chief, magnet of attraction towards the Montrevilles. Never before\nhad any assemblage of features possessed such power of him, but De\nCourcy's was not a heart on which mere beauty could make any very\npermanent impression; and, to the eternal disgrace of his gallantry, it\nmust be confessed, that he scarcely longed more for a second interview\nwith Laura, than he did for an opportunity of paying some grateful\ncivilities to the man who, twenty years before, had good-naturedly\nforgone the society of his equals in age, to sing ballads and make\npaper-kites for little Montague. Whatever member of his family occupied\nmost of his thoughts, certain it is, that he spoke much more that\nevening of Captain Montreville than of his daughter, until the arrival\nof the painting afforded him occasion to enlarge on her genius,\nindustry, and freedom from vulgar prejudice. On these he continued to\ndescant, till Mrs De Courcy smiled, and Harriet laughed openly; a\nliberty at which Montague testified his displeasure, by carefully\navoiding the subject for the rest of the evening.\n\nMeanwhile the ungrateful Laura had never, from the hour in which they\nmet, bestowed one thought upon her champion. The blackness of his eyes,\nand the whiteness of his teeth, had entirely escaped her observation;\nand, even if she had been asked, whether he was tall or short, she could\nscarcely have given a satisfactory reply. For this extraordinary\nstupidity, the only excuse is, that her heart was already occupied, the\nreader knows how, and that her thoughts were engrossed by an intention\nwhich her father had mentioned, of borrowing money upon his half-pay.\n\nThough Laura had never known affluence, she was equally a stranger to\nall the shames, the distresses, and embarrassments of a debtor; and the\nthoughts of borrowing what she could not hope by any economy to repay,\ngave to her upright mind the most cutting uneasiness. But no resource\nremained; for, even if Captain Montreville could have quitted London\nwithin the hour, he had not the means of defraying the expence of the\njourney. Warren's promises had hitherto produced nothing but hope, and\nthere was no immediate prospect that the payment of the annuity would\nrelieve the difficulty.\n\nLaura turned a despairing wish towards her picture, lamenting that she\nhad ever formed her presumptuous scheme, and hating herself for having,\nby her presence, increased the perplexities of her father. She prevailed\nupon him, however, to defer borrowing the money till the following day;\nand once more, accompanied by Julia, bent her almost hopeless steps\ntowards the print-shop.\n\nSilent and melancholy she passed on, equally regardless of the\nadmiration which she occasionally extorted, and of the animadversions,\ncalled forth by the appearance of so elegant a woman on foot, in the\nstreets of the city. As she entered the shop, she cast a half-despairing\nlook towards the place where her picture had hung, and her heart leapt\nwhen she perceived that it was gone. 'Well, Ma'am,' said Wilkins,\napproaching her, 'it is sold at last, and here is the money;' and he put\ninto her hands by far the largest sum they had ever contained. 'You may\nhave as much more whenever you please,' continued he, 'for the gentleman\nwho bought it wants a companion painted.'\n\nLaura spoke not,--she had not indeed the power to speak;--but she raised\nher eyes with a look that intelligibly said, 'Blessed Father! thy tender\nmercies are over all thy works.' Recollecting herself, she thanked\nWilkins, liberally rewarded him for his trouble, and taking her\ncompanion by the arm, she hastened homewards.\n\nThe sight of Laura's wealth powerfully affected the mind of Miss\nDawkins, and she formed an immediate resolution, to grow rich by similar\nmeans. One little objection to this scheme occurred to her, namely, that\nshe had learnt to draw only flowers, and that even this humble branch of\nthe art she had discontinued since she left school. But she thought that\na little practice would repair what she had lost, and that though\nperhaps flowers might not be so productive as historical pieces, she\nmight better her fortune by her works; at the least, they would furnish\nher with clothes and pocket-money. Upon this judicious plan, she\nharangued with great volubility to Laura, who, buried in her own\nreflections, walked silently on, unconscious even of the presence of her\nloquacious companion. As she approached her home, she began to frame a\nlittle speech, with which she meant to present her treasure to her\nfather; and, on entering the house, she flew with a beating heart to\nfind him. She laid her wealth upon his knee. 'My dearest father,' she\nbegan, 'the picture'--and she fell upon his neck and burst into tears.\nSympathetic tears stood in the eyes of Montreville. He had been\nsurprized at the stoicism with which his daughter appeared to him to\nsupport her disappointment, and he was not prepared to expect from her\nso much sensibility to success. But though Laura had learnt from\nfrequent experience, how to check the feelings of disappointment, to\npleasure such as she now felt she was new, and she could not controul\nits emotions. So far was she, however, from thinking that sensibility\nwas bestowed merely for an ornament, (an opinion which many fair ladies\nappear to entertain), that the expression of it was always with her an\noccasion of shame. Unable at this moment to contain herself, she burst\nfrom her father's embrace, and hiding herself in her chamber, poured\nforth a fervent thanksgiving to Him who 'feedeth the ravens when they\ncry to him.'\n\n'This money is yours my love,' said Captain Montreville to her when she\nreturned to the parlour. 'I cannot bear to rob you of it. Take it, and\nyou can supply me when I am in want of it.' The face and neck of Laura\nflushed crimson. Her whole soul revolted at the thought of her father's\nfeeling himself a pensioner on her bounty. 'No indeed, Sir,' she replied\nwith energy, 'it is yours--it always was intended for you. But for you,\nI could never have acquired it.' 'I will not disappoint your generosity,\nmy dearest,' said Montreville, 'part I will receive from you, but the\nrest you must keep. I know you must have many little wants.' 'No, Papa,'\nsaid Laura, 'so liberal has your kindness been to me, that I cannot at\nthis moment name a single want.' 'Wishes, then, you surely have,' said\nthe Captain, still pressing the money upon her; 'and let the\nfirst-fruits of your industry supply them.' 'I have no wishes,' said\nLaura; 'none at least which money can gratify:--and when I have,' added\nshe, with an affectionate smile, 'let their gratification come from you,\nthat its pleasure may be doubled to me.'\n\nNo creature could less value money for its own sake than did Laura. All\nher wealth, the fruit of so much labour and anxiety, would not have\npurchased the attire of a fashionable lady for one evening. She, who\nhad been accustomed to wander in happy freedom among her native hills,\nwas imprisoned amidst the smoke and dust of a city. Without a companion,\nalmost without an acquaintance to invigorate her spirits for the task,\nit was her province to revive the fainting hopes, and beguile the tedium\nof her father, who was depressed by disappointments in his pursuits, and\ndisconcerted by the absence of his accustomed employments. She was at a\ndistance from the object, not only of a tender affection, but of a\nromantic passion,--a passion, ardent in proportion as its object was\nindebted to her imagination for his power. Scarce three months had\nelapsed since the depravity of this idolized being had burst on her in\nthunder, the thought of it was still daggers to her heart, and it was\nvery doubtful whether he could ever give such proofs of reformation as\nwould make it safe for her to restore him to his place in her regard.\nYet be it known to all who, from similar circumstances, feel entitled to\nfancy themselves miserable, and thus (if they live with beings of common\nhumanity) make others really so, that no woman ever passed an evening in\nmore heartfelt content, than Laura did that which our history is now\nrecording. She did, indeed, possess that which, next to the overflowings\nof a pious heart, confers the purest happiness on this side Heaven. She\nfelt that she was USEFUL. Nay, in one respect the consciousness of a\nsuccessful discharge of duty has the advantage over the fervours of\ndevotion; for Providence, wise in its bounty, has decreed, that while\nthese foretastes of heavenly rapture are transient lest their delights\nshould detach us from the business of life, we are invited to a\nreligious practice by the permanence of its joys.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nCaptain Montreville and his daughter were engaged in a friendly contest\non the subject of a companion for the picture, when De Courcy made his\nvisit. Though, as he entered the room, something unfashionably like a\nblush visited his face, his manner was free from rustic embarrassment.\n'I believe,' said he, advancing towards Captain Montreville, 'I must\napologize for the intrusion of a stranger. My person must have outgrown\nyour recollection. My name, I hope, has been more fortunate. It is De\nCourcy.' 'The son I presume of Major De Courcy,' said Montreville,\ncordially extending his hand to him. 'Yes,' replied Montague, heartily\ntaking the offered hand; 'the same whose childhood was indebted to you\nfor so many of its pleasures.' 'My old friend Montague!' cried the\nCaptain, 'though your present form is new to me, I remember my lovely\nlittle noble-spirited play-fellow with an interest which I have never\nfelt in any other child except this girl.' 'And who knows,' said De\nCourcy, turning to Laura with a smile, 'who knows what cause I may find\nto rue that Miss Montreville is past the age when I might have repaid\nher father's kindness by assiduities to her doll?' 'That return,' said\nLaura, colouring, as she recollected her late champion, 'would not have\nbeen quite so arduous as the one you have already made. I hope you have\nhad no further trouble with those rude people?' 'No, Madam,' answered De\nCourcy, 'nor did I expect it; the spirits that are so insolent where\nthey dare, are submissive enough where they must.' Laura now explained\nto her father her obligation to De Courcy; and the Captain having\nthanked him for his interference, the conversation took a general turn.\n\nElated as he was with the successful industry and genius of his child,\nand pleased with the attentions of the son of his friend, the spirits\nof Montreville rose higher than they had ever done since his arrival in\nLondon. Won by the happy mixture of familiarity and respect, of spirit\nand gentleness, which distinguished the manners of De Courcy, the\nCaptain became cheerful, and Laura almost talkative: the conversation\nrose from easy to animated, from animated to gay; and two hours had\npassed before any of the party was aware that one-fourth of that time\nwas gone. Laura's general reserve with strangers seemed to have forsaken\nher while she conversed with De Courcy. But De Courcy was not a\nstranger. By character she knew him well. Hargrave had mentioned to her\nhis intimacy with De Courcy. Nay, De Courcy had, at the hazard of his\nlife, saved the life of Hargrave. Laura had heard her lover dwell with\nthe eloquence of gratitude upon the courage, the presence of mind, with\nwhich (while others, confounded by his danger, or fearing for their own\nsafety, left him to perish without aid), De Courcy had seized a fisher's\nnet, and, binding one end of it to a tree, the other to his body, had\nplunged into the water, and intercepted Hargrave, just as the stream was\nhurrying him to the brink of a tremendous fall. 'All struggle was in\nvain,' had Hargrave said to the breathless Laura; 'but for that noble\nfellow, that minute would have been my last, and I should have died\nwithout awakening this interest so dear to my heart.' 'I wish I could\nsee this De Courcy,' had Laura fervently exclaimed. 'Heaven forbid!' had\nbeen the hasty reply, 'for your habits--your pursuits--your sentiments\nare so similar, that he would gain without labour, perhaps without a\nwish, the heart that has cost me such anxious toil.' A recollection of\nthis dialogue stole into the mind of Laura, as De Courcy was expressing\nan opinion which, though not a common one, coincided exactly with her\nown. For a moment she was absent and thoughtful; but De Courcy continued\nthe conversation, and she resumed her gaiety.\n\nWhen unwillingly at last he rose to take his leave, Captain Montreville\ndetained him while he made some friendly inquiries into the history of\nthe family for the last twenty years. As the questions of the Captain,\nhowever, were not impertinently minute, nor the answers of De Courcy\nvery copious, it may not be improper to supply what was wanting in the\nnarrative.\n\nMajor De Courcy was the representative of a family which could trace its\ndescent from the times of the Conqueror,--an advantage which they valued\nabove the hereditary possessions of their fathers; and if an advantage\nought to be estimated by its durability, they were in the right; for\nthe former, of necessity, was improved by time, the latter seemed\ntending towards decline. Frederick De Courcy was suffered to follow his\ninclinations in entering the army; because that was the profession the\nmost suitable to the dignity of an ancient house. That it was of all\nprofessions the least likely to improve his fortune, was a consideration\nequally despised by his father and himself. When he attained his\nseventeenth year, a commission was purchased for him. Stored with\ncounsels sufficient, if he followed them, to conduct him to wisdom and\nhappiness, and with money sufficient to make these counsels of no avail,\nhe set out from his paternal home to join his regiment. Thus was De\nCourcy, in his dangerous passage from youth to manhood, committed to the\nguidance of example, and the discretion belonging to his years;\nfortified, indeed, by the injunctions of his parents, and his own\nresolutions, never to disgrace his descent. This bulwark, he soon found,\nwas too weak to resist the number and variety of the weapons which\nattacked him. The shafts of ridicule assailed him; his own passions took\nup arms; his pride itself turned against him. Unable to resist with\nvigour, he ceased to resist at all; and was hurried into every folly in\nwhich his companions wished for the assistance of his purse, or the\ncountenance of his example.\n\nHis father's liberal allowance was soon insufficient to supply his\nextravagance. He contracted debts. After severe but well-merited\nreproof, his father paid them; and De Courcy promised amendment. A whole\nweek of strict sobriety ensued; and the young soldier was convinced that\nhis resolution was immutable. And so he would probably have found it, if\nnow, for the first time since man was made, temptation had become weaker\nby victory, or virtue stronger by defeat. But though he had tasted the\nglittering bait of folly, and though he at times confessed its\ninsipidity, the same lure again prevailed, and De Courcy was again\nentangled in pecuniary embarrassments. What was to be done? His father\nhad declared his irrevocable determination no further to injure the\ninterests of his younger children by supplying the prodigality of the\neldest. By the advice of a veteran in profusion, De Courcy had recourse\nto Jews. As it was in his father's power to disinherit him, it was\nnecessary to conceal these transactions; and the high spirit of\nFrederick was compelled to submit to all the evasions, embarrassments,\nand wretchedness that attend a clandestine course of action.\n\nOften did he illustrate the trite observation that no life is more\nremote from happiness than a life of pleasure. The reward of all his\nlabour was satiety; the wages of all his self-reproaches were the\napplause of the thoughtless for his spirit; the lamentations of the\nwise, that an honourable mind should be so perverted. In his\ntwenty-second year, his father's death left him at liberty to pay his\nold debts, and to contract new. That which has preserved the virtue of\nmany young men, prevented the total ruin of De Courcy. He became\nattached to a virtuous woman; and, influenced much by inclination, more\nby the wishes of her friends, she married him.\n\nMrs De Courcy brought no dower except the beauty which had captivated\nher husband, the sweetness which prolonged her power, and the good sense\nwhich made that power useful. She therefore did not think herself\nentitled to remonstrate very warmly on the negligence that appeared in\nthe conduct of her husband's affairs; and it was not until after she\nbecame a mother that she judged it proper to interfere. Her gentle\nremonstrances, however, produced little effect beyond promises and vague\nresolutions, that at some '_convenient season_' the Major would examine\ninto the real state of his fortune.\n\nAccident at last befriended her endeavours. Soon after the birth of her\nsecond child (a daughter), a demand was made on De Courcy for a debt\nwhich he had not the means of discharging. He could not apply to the\nJew; for he had solemnly pledged to Mrs De Courcy, that he would never\nmore have recourse to that ruinous expedient. He was discussing with his\nwife the possibility of procuring the money by a new mortgage, while\nMontague, then a child of four year's old, was playing in the room.\nStruck by the melancholy tone of his mother's voice, the child forsook\nhis play, and taking hold of her gown, looked anxiously from one\nmournful face to the other. 'I am as averse to it as you can be, my\ndear,' said the Major, 'but there is no other way of raising the money.'\n'Wait till I am a man, Papa,' said the child; 'and then Betty says, I\nshall have a good two thousand pounds a-year, and I will give it all to\nyou. And here,' added he, searching his little pocket, 'here is my\npretty shilling that Captain Montreville gave me; take it, and don't\nlook sorry any more.' Mrs De Courcy passionately loved this child.\nOvercome by the feeling of the moment, she clasped him in her arms. 'My\npoor wronged child!' she exclaimed, and burst into tears.\n\nThese were the first words of bitterness which Major De Courcy had ever\nheard from her lips; and overcome by them, and by her tears, he gave her\na hasty promise, that he would, that very hour, begin the examination\nof his affairs. Sensible of her advantage, she permitted not his purpose\nto slumber, but persuaded him to a full inquiry into the extent of his\ndebts; and in order to remove him from future temptation, she prevailed\non him to sell his commission, and reside at his paternal Norwood.\n\nAfter selling so much of his estate as to clear the remainder from all\nincumbrance, he found his income diminished to little more than a third\nof its original extent. His family pride reviving at the sight of the\nhalls of his fathers, and a better affection awakening in his\nintercourse with the descendants of those whom his ancestors had\nprotected, he determined to guard against the possibility of Norwood and\nits tenants being transferred to strangers, and entailed the remains of\nhis property on Montague De Courcy, in the strictest form of English\nlaw. For Mrs De Courcy he made but a slender provision. For his daughter\nhe made none: but he determined to save from his income a sum sufficient\nto supply this deficiency. He was still a young man, and never thought\nof doubting whether he might live long enough to accomplish his design,\nor whether the man who had found an income of \u00c2\u00a32000 a-year too small for\nhis necessities, might be able to make savings from one of \u00c2\u00a3800. In\nspite of the soberness of the establishment, which during the novelty of\nhis reform he allowed Mrs De Courcy to arrange, he continued to find\nuses for all the money he could command. His fields wanted inclosures;\nhis houses needed repairs; his son's education was an increasing\nexpence; and he died while Montague was yet a boy, without having\nrealized any part of his plans in favour of his daughter.\n\nHe left the highest testimony to the understanding and worth of Mrs De\nCourcy, by making her the sole guardian of his children; and the steady\nrectitude and propriety of her conduct justified his confidence. Aware\nof the radical defect of every mode of education that neglects or severs\nthe domestic tie, yet convinced that the house where he was master, and\nthe dependents he could command, were dangerous scenes and companions\nfor a youth of Montague's spirit, she committed him to the care of a\nclergyman, whose residence was a few miles distant from Norwood, and who\nalso took charge of four other boys of about the same age.\n\nThis gentleman was admirably fitted for his trust; for he had a\ncultivated understanding, an affectionate heart, sound piety, and a calm\nbut inflexible temper. Add to which, he had travelled, and, in his\nyouth, associated much with men of rank, and more with men of talents;\nthough, since he had become a pastor, the range of his moral observation\nhad been narrowed to the hearts of a few simple villagers, which were\nopen to him as to their father and their friend. The boys studied and\nplayed together, but they each had a separate apartment; for Mr\nWentworth had himself been educated at a public school, and never\nrecollected without shuddering, the hour when his youthful modesty had\nshrunk from sharing his bed with a stranger, and when the prayer for his\nparents, which he was mingling with his tears, had been disturbed by the\njokes of a little rabble.\n\nEvery Saturday did Montague bend his joyful course homewards, regardless\nof summer's heat or winter storms. Every Sunday did his mother spend in\nmixing the lessons of piety with the endearments of love; in striving to\nconnect the idea of a superintending God with all that is beautiful--all\nthat is majestic--in nature. As her children grew up, she unfolded to\nthem the peculiar doctrines of Christianity, so sublime, so consolatory,\nso suitable to the wants of man. Aware how much occasion favours the\nstrength of impressions, she chose the hour of strong remorse on account\nof a youthful fault, while the culprit yet trembled before the offended\nMajesty of Heaven, to explain to her son the impossibility that\nrepentance should, of itself, cancel errors past, or that the great\nLawgiver should accept a few ineffectual tears, or a tardy and imperfect\nobedience, as a compensation for the breach of a law that is perfect.\nWhen she saw that the intended impression was made, she spoke of the\ngreat atonement that once was offered, not to make repentance\nunnecessary, but to make it effectual; and, from that time, using this\nas one of the great landmarks of faith, she contributed to make it in\nthe mind of De Courcy a practical and abiding principle. The peculiar\nprecepts of Christianity she taught him to apply to his actions, by\napplying them herself; and the praise that is so often lavished upon\nboldness, dexterity, and spirit, she conscientiously reserved for acts\nof candour, humility, and self-denial.\n\nHer cares were amply rewarded, and Montague became all that she wished\nhim to be. He was a Christian from the heart, without being either\nforward to claim, or ashamed to own, the distinction. He was industrious\nin his pursuits, and simple in his pleasures. But the distinctive\nfeature of his character, was the total absence of selfishness. His own\npleasure or his own amusement he never hesitated to sacrifice to the\nwishes of others; or, to speak more correctly, he found his pleasure\nand amusement in theirs. Upon the whole, we do not say that Montague De\nCourcy had no faults; but we are sure he had none that he did not strive\nto conquer. Like other human beings, he sometimes acted wrong; but we\nbelieve he would not deliberately have neglected a known duty to escape\nany worldly misfortune; we are sure he would not deliberately have\ncommitted a crime to attain any earthly advantage.\n\nDesirous that her darling should enjoy the benefits of the most liberal\neducation, yet afraid to trust him to the temptations of an English\nuniversity, Mrs De Courcy went for some years to reside in Edinburgh\nduring the winter--in summer she returned with her family to Norwood. To\nhis private studies, and his paternal home, Montague returned with ever\nnew delight; for his tastes and his habits were all domestic. He had no\nambitious wishes to lure him from his retreat, for his wants were even\nmore moderate than his fortune. Except in so far as he could make it\nuseful to others, he had no value for money, nor for anything that money\ncould buy, exclusive of the necessaries of life, books, and implements\nof chemistry. The profession which he had chosen was that of improving\nand embellishing his estate; and, in the tranquil pleasures of a country\ngentleman, a man of taste, a classical scholar, and a chemist, he found\nmeans to occupy himself without injury to his health, his morals, or his\nfortune. His favourite amusements were drawing and physiognomy; and,\nlike other favourites, these were sometimes in danger of making\nencroachments, and advancing into the rank of higher concerns. But this\nhe prevented by an exact distribution of his time, to which he\nresolutely adhered.\n\nWith his mother and his sister he lived in the most perfect harmony,\nthough the young lady had the reputation of a wit, and was certainly a\nlittle addicted to sarcasm. But she was in other respects amiable, and\nincapable of doing anything to offend her brother, whose indignation\nindeed never rose but against cruelty, meanness, or deceit.\n\nDe Courcy had just entered his twenty-fifth year, when a rheumatic fever\ndeprived his mother of the use of her limbs; and, forsaking all his\nemployments, he had quitted his beloved Norwood to attend her in London,\nwhither she had come for the benefit of medical advice. He had been but\na few days in town when he met with Miss Montreville, and the impression\nwhich her beauty made, the second interview tended to confirm.\n\nMontague had never, even in imagination, been in love. The regulation of\nhis passions, the improvement of his mind, and the care of his property,\nhad hitherto left him no leisure for the tender folly. He had scarcely\never thought of a young woman's face, except with a reference to\nLavater's opinion, nor of her manners, except to wonder how she could be\nso obtrusive. But in contemplating Laura's face, he forgot the rules of\nthe physiognomist; and, in the interesting reserve of her manners, he\nfound continually something to desire. If, at the close of his visit, he\nwas not in love, he was at least in a fair way for being so. He was\nassailed at once by beauty, grace, good sense, and sweetness; and to\nthese Laura added the singular charm of being wholly insensible to their\neffects upon the beholder. No side glance was sent in search of\nadmiration; no care was taken to compose her drapery; no look of triumph\naccompanied her judicious remarks; no parade of sensibility disgraced\nher tenderness. Every charm was heightened by a matchless absence of all\ndesign; and against this formidable battery had poor De Courcy to make\nhis stand, just at the inauspicious hour when, for the first time in his\nlife, he had nothing else to do.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nAs soon as De Courcy was gone, Captain Montreville launched out warmly\nin his praise. Laura joined in the eulogium; and, the next morning,\nforgot that there was such a person in existence, when she read a letter\nfrom Mrs Douglas, of which the following was a part.\n\n     'Before this reaches you, Colonel Hargrave will be far on his\n     way to London. It is possible that you may have no interest in\n     this journey; but, lest you should, I wish to prevent your\n     being taken by surprize. Since your departure he has repeatedly\n     visited us; and endeavoured, both directly and indirectly, to\n     discover your address. Perhaps you will think my caution\n     ill-timed; but I acted according to my best judgment, in\n     avoiding to comply with his desire. I think, however, that he\n     has elsewhere procured the information he wanted; for his\n     features wore an air of triumph, as he asked my commands for\n     you. Dear child of my affections, richly endowed as you are\n     with the dangerous gift of beauty, you have hitherto escaped,\n     as if by miracle, from the snares of folly and frivolity. My\n     hearts prayer for you is, that you may be as safe from the\n     dangers that await you, in the passions of others, and in the\n     tenderness of your own heart. But alas! my beloved Laura,\n     distant as I am from you, ignorant as I am of the peculiarities\n     of your situation, I can _only_ pray for you. I fear to express\n     my conjectures, lest I should seem to extort your confidence. I\n     fear to caution, lest I should shock or offend you. Yet let me\n     remind you, that it is easier, by one bold effort, to reject\n     temptation, than to resist its continued allurements.\n     Effectually to bar the access of the tempter may cost a painful\n     effort--to parley with him is destruction. But I must stop.\n     Tears of anxious affection blot what I have written.\n\n                                           'E. DOUGLAS.'\n\nThe joyful expectation of seeing Hargrave filled for a time the heart of\nLaura, and left no room for other thoughts. The first that found\nentrance was of a less pleasing cast. She perceived that Mrs Douglas\nsuspected Hargrave of the baseness of deliberate seduction; and, with a\nfeeling of indignation, she collected her writing materials, and sat\ndown to exculpate him. But, as she again read her friend's expressions\nof affection, and considered how little her suspicions were remote from\nthe truth, she accused herself of ingratitude and injustice in giving\nway to any thing like resentment. She thanked Mrs Douglas for her\ncautions; but assured her, that the proposals of Hargrave were\nhonourable, unequivocal, and sanctioned by her father; that they had\nbeen rejected by herself; and, therefore, that no motive, except that of\nvindicating him from an unfounded suspicion, should have tempted her to\nbetray, even to her most confidential friend, a secret which she thought\na woman bound, both in delicacy and in honour, to keep inviolable. She\ndid not once hint at the cause of her rejecting an offer so splendid,\nnor show a trace of the inclination which she had so nobly sacrificed to\nvirtue, except what appeared in the warmth of her defence of her lover.\nFor, though she felt that her story would have raised her in her\nfriend's esteem, she scorned to purchase that advantage at the expence\nof another, and retained all her aversion to exposing the faults of\nHargrave.\n\nHaving finished her letter, she returned to the more agreeable\ncontemplation, and began to calculate upon the time when she might\nexpect to see the Colonel. Her conclusion was, that he would probably\nvisit her on the following day, and her heart throbbed with delight at\nthe prospect.\n\nBut from the dream of joy, Laura soon returned to the more habitual\nconsideration of the line of conduct which it was fit that she should\npursue. She saw the folly of committing her happiness to the\nguardianship of one whose passions were his masters; and, while it was\nher daily prayer that she might not be led into temptation, her\nconscience revolted from trusting her conduct to the guidance, her\nvirtue to the example, of a man whose principles were doubtful. For\nLaura's virtue was not of that saint-errant kind that sallies forth in\nquest of opportunities to signalize itself, and inflames its pride by\nmeditation on the wonders it would achieve, if placed in perilous\nsituations. Distrustful of herself--watchful to avoid occasions of\nfalling--she had no ambition for the dangerous glory of reforming a rake\ninto a good husband. She therefore adhered to her determination, that\nshe would not consent to a union with her lover, till, by a course of\nvirtuous conduct he had given proof that his offence had been the sudden\nfault of a moment, not the deliberate purpose of a corrupted heart.\n\nYet even in this mitigated view, the recollection was poison to the soul\nof Laura. The painful thought was far from new to her, that the passion\nof Hargrave was a tribute to her personal charms alone. With such a\npassion, even were its continuance possible, Laura felt that she could\nnot be satisfied. To be the object of it degraded her in her own eyes.\n'No, no,' she exclaimed, covering her face with her hands, 'let me not\neven legally occupy only the place which the vilest might fill. If I\ncannot be the friend, the companion, as well as the mistress, better,\nfar better, were it that we should part for ever.'\n\nNo labour is sufficient to acquaint us fully with our own hearts. It\nnever occurred to Laura, that she was, as much as Hargrave, the captive\nof mere externals; and that his character would never have deceived her\npenetration, had it been exhibited in the person of a little red-haired\nman, with bandy legs, who spoke broad Scotch, and smoked tobacco. Till\nthe hour when he had himself dispelled the illusion, the character of\nHargrave, such as she chose to imagine it, had been to her a theme of\nthe most delightful contemplation; and to its fascinations she had\nwillingly and entirely resigned herself. The disguise, which was rather\nthe excuse, than the cause of her passion, had been dropped in part; yet\nthe passion was as strong as ever. It was, indeed, no longer pleasing,\nno longer blind, no longer paramount; for her reason, which had before\nbeen silent, was now permitted to speak, and though it was unable to\nconquer, it could control. She imagined the vehemence with which\nHargrave would urge her to shorten the term of his probation, and she\nfeared that she should find it difficult, perhaps impossible, to resist\nhis entreaties. She would not, therefore, expose her prudence to too\nsevere a trial. 'Yes,' said she, 'I will bar the access of the tempter.\nI will see Hargrave only once, and that shall be to bid him farewell,\ntill the stipulated two years are finished. If he really loves me, his\naffection will survive absence. If it fail in the trial, I may, though\nlost to happiness, find in my solitude a peace that never can visit a\nneglected wife.'\n\nThis philosophic conclusion was the fruit of her meditations during a\nrestless night; and having worked herself, as she thought, into a temper\ndecorously relentless, she proceeded, with all the consistency of her\nsex, to adorn her person with a care she had never before bestowed upon\nit. She arranged every curl for effect; chose a dress which shewed to\nadvantage the graceful slope of her shoulders; and heightened the\nwhiteness of her neck and arms, by contrasting it with fillets of jet.\nThough she was but indifferently pleased with her success, it proved\nsufficient for her occasions. The day passed away, and Hargrave did not\nappear. Laura was disappointed, but not surprized; for it was barely\npossible that he could have reached London on that day. On the\nsucceeding one she thought it likely that he might come; but the\nsucceeding one was equally barren of event.\n\nOn the third she was certain that he would arrive; and, when breakfast\nwas over, she seated herself in expectation at the window of the front\nparlour, started if a carriage stopped, and listened to every voice that\nsounded from below stairs. Half-desirous to escape her father's\nobservation, half-wishing that her interview with Hargrave should be\nwithout witnesses, she persuaded Captain Montreville to go and pay his\nrespects to Mrs De Courcy. Anxiously she waited, conjectured, doubted,\nreconsulted Mrs Douglas's letter. The Captain returned; the hours of\nvisiting passed away; and still no Hargrave came.\n\nUnwilling to own, even to herself, the extent of her anxiety and\ndisappointment, Laura talked to her father of his visit, with which he\nhad been highly pleased. He had been amused with Harriet; charmed with\nMrs De Courcy; and doubly charmed with Montague, whom he praised as a\nscholar and a man of sense, as an affectionate brother and a respectful\nson; and, to crown all these commendations, he declared, that De Courcy\nwas more than a match for himself at chess.\n\nWhen they retired for the night, Laura returned to her conjectures on\nthe cause of Hargrave's delay. She considered that he might have been\ndetained on the road, or that he might have found it necessary to make a\nvisit on his way. She had little doubt, that to see her was the object\nof his journey to London at this unfashionable season. She had none,\nthat he would hurry to her the first moment that it was possible. By\ndegrees, she persuaded herself into an absolute certainty that she\nshould see him on the following day; and on that day, she again took her\nanxious station in the parlour.\n\nShe was ashamed to lean over the window, and could not otherwise see who\nentered the house; but she left the room door ajar, that she might have\nwarning of his approach, held her breath to distinguish the voices from\nbelow, and listened eagerly to every footstep. At last, she imagined\nthat she heard the wished-for inquiry. She was sure some one pronounced\nher name. A man's step ascended the stair; Laura trembled and her breath\ncame short. She feared to look up, and leant her face on her hand to\nconceal her emotion.\n\nThe voice of her visitor made her start, and turn her head. It was\nWarren!\n\nExpectation had been wound up to its highest pitch, and Laura could not\ninstantly recover herself. She paid her compliments with a confusion and\ntrepidation, which Warren interpreted in a way most flattering to his\nvanity. He approached her with a look, in which ill-suppressed triumph\ncontended with laboured condescension; and spoke to her in a voice that\nseemed to say, 'Pray, endeavour to reassure yourself.' But Laura was in\nno humour to endure his impertinence, and she seized the first\nopportunity to leave the room.\n\nCaptain Montreville soon entered on the business in which he took such\npainful interest, by inquiring whether any traces had yet been\ndiscovered of the sale of his daughter's annuity. Warren, with abundance\nof regret and condolence, informed him, that Williams had as yet been\nable to discover no mention of the transaction in the books.\n\nThis assertion was so far true, that Williams had as yet seen no record\nof the business in question; for which Mr Warren could, if he had\nchosen, have given a very satisfactory reason. From the moment this\n_gentleman_ had first seen Laura, he had been determined not wilfully to\nexpedite her departure from London; and therefore he had casually\ndropped a hint to his man of business, that, as he was already\noverwhelmed with a multiplicity of affairs, it was unnecessary to hasten\na concern of such trivial importance; and that he might defer inquiring\ninto the sale of the annuity till he was at perfect leisure. Had he\ninsinuated to Williams, that this delay was detaining from his home a\nman who could ill afford the consequent expence, or that it was alarming\na father for the future subsistence of his only child, the man of\nbusiness would have found leisure to investigate the matter, even if he\nhad subtracted the necessary time from his hours of rest. But the\nupright Mr Warren had given no such intimation; and in this honourable\ntransaction, he was, for the present, secure from detection, for he knew\nthat business had called his agent to a distance from London.\n\nCaptain Montreville knew not what to think. He could not doubt the\nintegrity of Mr Baynard, nor could he imagine to what purpose Warren\nshould deny the transaction; since, if it had really taken place, the\nvouchers of it must be found among his deceased friend's papers. He was\npersuaded that to examine the books according to the date of the sale,\nwould be the work of only a few hours; and again he inquired whether the\nnecessary examination had taken place. Mr Warren answered, that he could\nnot take it upon him to say that every possible search had yet been\nmade; but his agent, he said, had examined all the most probable records\nof the concern, and would, on his return to town, make a still more\nparticular scrutiny.\n\nWith this unsatisfactory answer, Captain Montreville was obliged to\ncontent himself. He had only one alternative--either to wait in London\nthe appointment of the person who was to arrange Mr Baynard's papers, or\nto return to Scotland, and resign all hopes of the annuity. He feared,\ntoo, to offend Warren by urging him too strongly, since, even should a\nvoucher of the payment of his \u00c2\u00a31500 be found, the informality in the\ndeed would still leave room for litigation. No merely personal interest\nwould have induced the high spirit of Montreville to conciliate a man\nwhom he despised as a fool and a coxcomb.--For nothing that concerned\nhimself alone, would he have submitted to the trouble and anxiety which\nhe had lately undergone. Ill calculated by nature to struggle with\ndifficulties, he had long been accustomed to let the lesser disasters\nglide by without notice, and to sink, without effort, under the greater.\nDisappointed in the woman of his choice, and deprived, by her folly or\nperverseness, of the domestic pleasures which he loved, his mind had\ntaken a cast of melancholy. Early secluded from society, and tormented\nby the temper of his wife, he had concentrated all the affections which\nsolitude confined, and caprice rejected, upon one object: and Laura\nbecame the passion of his soul. The thought of leaving her destitute, of\nleaving her sensibility to the scorns, her beauty to the temptations of\npoverty, was more than he could bear, and it sometimes almost\noverpowered him. He was naturally inclined to indolence, and as, like\nall indolent people, he was the creature of habit, his spirits had\nsuffered much from the loss of the woman who, though too heartless for a\nfriend, and too bitter for a companion, had, for twenty years, served\nhim as a sort of stimulus. The same force of habit, joined to her\nimproving graces and confirming worth, made Laura daily more dear to\nhim, and he would willingly have given his life to secure her\nindependence and happiness.\n\nBrooding on the obscurity in which she must remain, whom he judged\nworthy to adorn the highest station--on the poverty which awaited her\nduring his life--on the want to which his death must consign\nher,--removed from his habitual occupations, and deprived of the\nwholesome air, and exhilarating exercises to which he had long been\naccustomed, he allowed his spirits to grow daily more depressed. Along\nwith the idea of the misfortunes which his death would bring upon his\ndarling, the fear of death settled on his mind. The little ailments to\nwhich the sedentary are liable, he magnified into the symptoms of mortal\ndisease; and momentary pain seemed to his fancy to foretell sudden\ndissolution. Montreville was fast sinking into a melancholy\nhypochondriac.\n\nHis daughter's spirits, too, failed under continued expectation, and\ncontinued disappointment; for day after day passed on, and still\nHargrave came not. Her father's dejection increased her own, and her\nill-disguised depression had a similar effect on him. While, however,\nCaptain Montreville gave way without effort to his feelings, the more\nvigorous mind of Laura struggled to suppress the sorrow which she saw\nwas contagious. She sometimes prevailed upon her father to seek\namusement abroad, sometimes endeavoured to amuse him at home. She read\nto him, sung to him, exerted all her conversation talent to entertain\nhim; and often, when all was in vain, when he would answer her by forced\nsmiles, languid gestures, or heavy sighs, she would turn aside to wipe\nthe tears from her eyes, then smile, and attempt her task again.\n\nIn these labours she had now, it is true, the assistance of an\nintelligent companion. De Courcy came often; and the Captain seemed to\nreceive a pleasure from his visits, which even Laura's efforts could not\nbestow. The tenderness of his child, indeed, appeared sometimes to\noverpower him; for, when she was exerting herself to divert his\nmelancholy, he would gaze upon her for a while in an agony of fondness,\nthen suddenly desire to be left alone, and dismiss her from his\npresence. But De Courcy's attentions seemed always welcome. He soothed\nthe irritated mind with respectful assiduities--he felt for its sickly\nsensibility--and, though ignorant of the cause of Montreville's\ndejection, found in alleviating it a pleasure, which was more than\ndoubled by the undisguised approbation and gratitude of Laura.\n\nHis sister, too, came to visit Miss Montreville, and, apologizing for\nher mother, who was unable to accompany her, brought an invitation for\nthe Captain and his daughter to dine in Audley Street. Laura, in hopes\nof amusing her father, prevailed on him to accept the invitation; and an\nearly day was fixed for the visit. She was pleased with the frankness\nand gaiety of Harriet's manner, and her curiosity was roused by Captain\nMontreville's praises of Mrs De Courcy.\n\nThe day arrived, and Laura prepared to accompany her father, not without\ntrepidation at the thought of entering, for the first time in her life,\na room which she expected to find full of strangers. When she had\nfinished dressing, he examined her with triumph; and thought that\nnothing in nature was so perfect. The thought was legible in his\ncountenance, and Laura, with great simplicity, answered to it as if it\nhad been spoken. 'Except to please you,' said she, 'I wish I had been\nneither tall nor pretty, for then I should have been allowed to move\nabout without notice.' 'Then, too,' thought she with a heavy sigh, 'I\nshould have been loved for my self, and not have been perhaps\nforgotten.'\n\nLaura was not ignorant of her own beauty, but no human being could less\nvalue the distinction. She was aware of the regularity of her features;\nbut as she never used a looking-glass, unless for the obvious purpose of\narranging her dress, she was insensible of the celestial charm which\nexpression added to her face. The seriousness and dignity of her manners\nmade it difficult to address her with common-place compliment; and she\nhad accordingly never experienced any effect of her beauty, but one\nwhich was altogether disagreeable to her, that of attracting notice. To\nbeing the subject of observation, Laura retained that Caledonian dislike\nwhich once distinguished her country-women, before they were polished\ninto that glitter which attracts the vulgar, and paid for the\nacquisition by the loss of the timidity which, like the \u00c3\u00a6rugo of ancient\ncoin, adds value in the eye of taste to intrinsic worth, while it\nshields even baser merit from contempt.\n\nLaura's courage failed her when, throwing open the door of a large room,\nMrs de Courcy's servant announced Captain and Miss Montreville. But she\nrevived when she perceived that the company consisted only of the\nmistress of the house, her son and daughter. Mrs de Courcy's appearance\nseemed to Laura very prepossessing. She still wore the dress of a widow;\nand her countenance bore the traces of what is called a green old age;\nfor though the hair that shaded her commanding forehead was silver\nwhite, her dark eyes retained their brightness; and though her\ncomplexion was pale, it glowed at times with the roses of youth. The\nexpression of her face, which was serious even to solemnity, brightened\nwith a smile of inexpressible benevolence, as she received her guests;\nand, even in the difficulty with which she appeared to move, Laura found\nsomewhat interesting. Her air and manners, without a tincture of\nfashion, spoke the gentlewoman. Her dress, her person, her demeanour,\nevery thing about her seemed consistently respectable. The dinner was\nplain, but excellent. The few indispensable pieces of plate were antique\nand massive; and the only attendant who appeared, seemed to have grown\ngray in the service of the family. Laura had pleasure in observing, that\nthe reverence with which this old man addressed his lady, softened into\naffectionate solicitude to please when he attended De Courcy, who, in\nhis turn, seemed to treat him with the most considerate gentleness.\n\nMrs De Courcy behaved to Laura with distinguished politeness; addressed\nher often; endeavoured to draw forth her latent powers; and soon made\nher sensible that the impression she had given, was no less favourable\nthan that which she had received. Montague's conversation had its\naccustomed effect on Montreville, and the lively Harriet gave spirit to\nthe whole. The evening passed most agreeably; and Laura was sorry when\nthe hour of separation arrived. Mrs De Courcy courteously thanked her\nfor her visit, and begged her to repeat it; but Harriet sportively\nobjected: 'No, no,' said she, 'if you come back, you will not leave a\nheart among all the household--even old John's seems in danger.'\n\n'Well, Mamma,' continued she, when Laura was gone, 'what do you think of\nmy brother's beauty?' 'I think,' said Mrs De Courcy, 'that Montague's\npraises did her no more than justice. She is the most lovely, the most\nelegant woman I ever saw,' 'She is no doubt beautiful and interesting,'\nreturned Harriet; 'but I must still think she has too much of the\nbuckram of the old school to be elegant.' Montague bit his lip, and\ntried, before he spoke, to ascertain that he was not angry. 'You are too\nsevere, Harriet,' said Mrs De Courcy. 'Miss Montreville's reserve is not\nstiffness--it is not \"buckram;\" it is rather the graceful drapery,\nembellishing what it veils.' 'Mother,' cried Montague, grasping her\nhand, 'you have more candour, sense, and taste, than all the misses in\nEngland.' 'Oh! pray, except Miss Montreville and the present company,'\nsaid Harriet, laughing. 'She, you know, is all perfection; and _I_ have\nreally candour, sense, and taste enough to admire her more than ever I\ndid any woman, except my little self.' De Courcy threw his arm around\nher--'I see by that good-natured smile,' said he, 'that my dear Harriet\nhas at least candour enough to pardon the folly of a wayward brother.'\nAnd, for the rest of the evening, he treated her with even more than his\nusual attentive kindness.\n\nFrom this day Miss De Courcy frequently accompanied her brother on his\nvisits to the Montrevilles, and Laura was a welcome guest in Audley\nStreet. By degrees Mrs De Courcy and she discovered the real worth of\neach other's character, and their mutual reserve entirely disappeared.\nBetween Laura and De Courcy, almost from the first hour of their\nacquaintance, there seemed (to use the language of romance) a sympathy\nof souls;--an expression which, if it has any meaning, must mean the\nfacility with which simple, upright, undesigning minds become\nintelligible to each other. Even the sarcastic Harriet found, in the\nchaste propriety of Laura's character, something to command respect; and\nin her gentleness and warmth of heart, something to engage affection;\nwhile, in her ideas, which solitude had slightly tinged with romance,\nthough strong sense had preserved them from absurdity, and in her\nlanguage, which sometimes rose to the very verge of poetry, she found\nconstantly somewhat to interest and amuse.\n\nMeanwhile Montreville's dejection seemed to increase; and Laura's health\nand spirits, in spite of her efforts to support them, daily declined.\nHargrave did not appear, and vainly did she endeavour to account for his\nabsence. She at first conjectured that he had found it impossible to\nleave Scotland at the time he proposed; but a second letter from Mrs\nDouglas had mentioned his departure, and repeated the assurance that,\nhowever obtained, he had information of Laura's address, since he had\nundertaken to be the bearer of a letter from a neighbouring gentleman to\nCaptain Montreville.\n\nShe next supposed that he had stopped on the road, or quitted it on some\nerrand of business or pleasure--but a newspaper account of a f\u00c3\u00aate\nchamp\u00c3\u00aatre at Lady Bellamer's elegant villa at Richmond, was graced,\namong other fashionable names, with that of the handsome Colonel\nHargrave, nephew and heir of Lord Lincourt. No supposition remained to\nbe made, except the mortifying one, that three months of absence had\nerased her image from the fickle heart of Hargrave. She, who had herself\nconsigned her lover to a banishment of two years, could not bear that\nhe should voluntarily undergo one of a few weeks. Nay, she had once\nherself resigned him; but to be herself resigned without effort, was\nmore than she could endure. Her appetite, her sleep forsook her; her\nordinary employments became irksome; and even the picture, the price of\nwhich was so soon to be necessary, she had not the spirits to finish.\n\nBut one who was accustomed every night to examine the thoughts and\nactions of the day, was not likely to remain long a prey to inactive\nmelancholy. Not satisfied with languid efforts in the discharge of duty,\nshe reproached herself for every failure. She upbraided herself as a\nwicked and slothful servant, who, when the means of usefulness were put\nin her power, suffered them to remain unimproved; as a rebel who had\ndeserted the service of her rightful master, to bow to the worse than\nEgyptian bondage of her passions. She accused herself of having given up\nher love, her wishes, her hopes and fears, almost her worship, to an\nidol; and no sooner did this thought occur to the pious mind of Laura,\nthan she became resigned to her loss. She even felt grateful--with such\ngratitude as the wretch feels under the knife which amputates the morbid\nlimb.\n\nUnused to let her self-reproaches pass without improvement, she\nresolved, by vigorous efforts, to become herself again. She even called\nin the aid of a decent pride. 'Shall I,' she cried, 'who have vowed to\novercome the world--I who have called myself by that glorious name, a\nChristian, sink from these honours into a love-sick girl? Shall all my\nhappiness, all my duties, the comfort of my father, the very means of\nhis support, be sacrificed to a selfish passion? Or is a love, whose\ntransient duration has proved its degenerate nature, of such value to\nme, that I must repay it with my whole heart and soul?'\n\nThese reflections were not made at once, nor were they at once\neffectual; but, when made, they were called in as oft as the image of\nHargrave intruded unbidden; and constant and regular occupation was\nagain employed to second their operation. The picture was again resorted\nto; but, as it afforded rather an unsocial employment, and as Laura's\ncompany was more than ever necessary to her father, it proceeded but\nslowly.\n\nDe Courcy was now a daily visitor. Sometimes he brought books, and would\nspend hours in reading aloud, an accomplishment in which he excelled.\nSometimes he would amuse the Captain and his daughter by experiments in\nhis favourite science. With a gentleness peculiar to himself, he tried\nto prevent the little annoyances to which hypochondriacs are subject.\nHe invented a hundred little indulgences for the invalid; and no day\npassed in which Montreville was not indebted for some comfort, or some\namusement, to the considerate kindness of De Courcy. At times he would\ngently rally the Captain on his imaginary ailments, and sometimes\nprevailed on him to take the air in Mrs De Courcy's carriage: though to\nsuch a height had fancy worked upon him, that Montague found it\nimpossible to persuade him that he was able to endure the fatigue of\nwalking.\n\nTo Laura, De Courcy's behaviour, uniformly respectful and attentive, was\nsometimes even tender. But, accustomed to see love only in the\nimpassioned looks of Hargrave, to hear its accents only in his words of\nfire, she did not recognize it in a new form; and to consider De Courcy\nas a lover, never once entered her imagination. Captain Montreville was\nmore clear-sighted, and hence arose much of the pleasure which he took\nin De Courcy's visits. Not that he was more knowing in the mysteries of\nlove than his daughter; but he took it for granted, that no mortal could\nwithstand her attractions; and he was persuaded that Laura would not\nwithhold her heart, where she so freely expressed approbation. This\nopinion was a proof of the justice of the Captain's former confession,\n'that women were creatures he did not understand.' Laura had never\npraised Hargrave. She never shrunk from De Courcy's eye,--she never felt\nembarrassed by his presence,--she treated him with the frankness of a\nsister; and though she reserved her commendations for his absence, she\nwaited only for that to bestow them with all the warmth which his own\nmerit and his attentions to her father could demand.\n\nMeanwhile the Captain did not, by a premature disclosure of his hopes,\nendanger their completion; and De Courcy continued unconsciously to\nfoster in his bosom, a passion that was destined to destroy his peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nThe picture at last was finished, and Laura herself accompanied it to\nthe print-shop. Wilkins immediately delivered to her the price, which,\nhe said, had been for some time in his hands. It now occurred to Laura\nto ask who had been the purchaser of her work. 'Why, Ma'am,' said\nWilkins, 'the gentleman desired me not to mention his name.' 'Indeed!'\nsaid Laura surprised. 'These were his orders. Ma'am, but I shouldn't\nthink there could be any great harm in telling it just to you Ma'am.' 'I\nhave no wish to hear it,' said Laura, with a look which compelled the\nconfident to unwilling discretion; and again thanking him for the\ntrouble he had taken, she returned home. The truth was, that De Courcy\nhad foreseen the probability of Laura's question; and averse to be known\nto her under a character that savoured of patronage and protection, had\nforbidden the shopkeeper to mention who had purchased the pictures.\n\nAgain did Laura, delighted, present to her father the produce of her\nlabours, her warm heart glowing with the joys of usefulness. But not as\nformerly did he with pleasure receive the gift. With the fretfulness of\ndisease, he refused to share in her satisfaction. Through the gloom of\nmelancholy, every object appeared distorted; and Captain Montreville saw\nin his daughter's well-earned treasure only the wages of degrading toil.\n'It is hard, very hard,' said he with a deep sigh, 'that you, my lovely\nchild, should be dependent on your daily labour for your support.' 'Oh\ncall it not hard, my dear father,' cried Laura. 'Thanks, a thousand\nthanks to your kind foresight, which, in teaching me this blessed art,\nsecured to me the only real independence, by making me independent of\nall but my own exertions.' 'Child,' said Montreville, fretfully, 'there\nis an enthusiasm about you that will draw you into ten thousand\nerrors--you are quite mistaken in fancying yourself independent. Your\nboasted art depends upon the taste, the very caprice of the public for\nits reward; and you, of course, upon the very same caprice for your very\nexistence.' 'It is true,' answered Laura mildly, 'that my success\ndepends upon taste, and that the public taste is capricious; but some, I\nshould hope, would never be wanting, who could value and reward the\nlabours of industry--you observe,' added she with a smile, 'that I rest\nnothing upon genius.' 'Be that as it may,' returned Captain Montreville,\nwith increasing querulousness, 'I cannot endure to see you degraded into\nan artist, and, therefore, I desire there may be no more of this\ntraffic.'\n\nThis was the first time that Montreville had ever resorted to the method\nwell known and approved by those persons of both sexes, who, being more\naccustomed to the exercise of authority than of argument, choose to\nwield the weapon in the use of which practice has made them the most\nexpert. Laura looked at him with affectionate concern--'Alas!' thought\nshe, 'if bodily disease is pitiable, how far more deplorable are its\nravages on the mind.' But even if her father had been in perfect health,\nshe would not have chosen the moment of irritation for reply. Deeply\nmortified at this unexpected prohibition, she yet endeavoured to\nconsider it as only one of the transient caprices of illness, and to\nfind pleasure in the thought, that the hour was come, when De Courcy's\ndaily visit would restore her father to some degree of cheerfulness.\n\nBut De Courcy's visit made no one cheerful. He was himself melancholy\nand absent. He said he had only a few minutes to spare, yet lingered\nabove an hour; often rose to go, yet irresolutely resumed his seat. At\nlast, starting up, he said, 'the longer I remain here, the more\nunwilling I am to go; and yet I _must_ go, without even knowing when I\nmay return.' 'Are _you_ going to leave us?' said Montreville, in a tone\nof despondency, 'then we shall be solitary indeed.' 'I fear,' said\nLaura, looking with kind solicitude in De Courcy's face, 'that something\ndistressing calls you away.' 'Distressing indeed,' said De Courcy. 'My\nexcellent old friend Mr Wentworth has lost his only son, and I must bear\nthe news to the parents.' 'Is there no one but you to do this painful\noffice?' asked Montreville. 'None,' answered De Courcy, 'on whom it\ncould with such propriety fall. Wentworth was one of my earliest\nfriends, he was my father's early friend. I owe him a thousand\nobligations; and I would fain, if it be possible, soften this heavy\nblow. Besides,' added he, endeavouring to speak more cheerfully, 'I have\na selfish purpose to serve,--I want to see how a Christian bears\nmisfortune.' 'And can you fix no time for your return?' asked the\nCaptain, mournfully. De Courcy shook his head. 'You will not return\nwhile your presence is necessary to Mr Wentworth,' said Laura, less\nanxious to regain De Courcy's society, than that he support the\ncharacter of benevolence with which her imagination had justly vested\nhim. Grieved by the prospect of losing his companion, fretted by an\nindefinite idea that he was wrong in his ungracious rejection of his\ndaughter's efforts to serve him, ashamed of his distempered selfishness,\nyet unable to conquer it, Captain Montreville naturally became more\npeevish; for the consciousness of having acted wrong, without the\nresolution to repair the fault, is what no temper can stand. 'Your\ncharity is mighty excursive Laura,' said he. 'If Mr De Courcy delays his\nreturn long, I shall probably not live to profit by it.' Laura, whose\nsweetness no captious expressions could ruffle, would have spoken to\nturn her father's view to brighter prospects; but the rising sob choked\nher voice, and courtesying hastily to De Courcy, she left the room. De\nCourcy now no longer found it difficult to depart. He soon bade the\nCaptain farewell, promising to return as soon as it was possible, though\nhe had no great faith in Montreville's dismal prediction, uttered in the\ntrue spirit of hypochondriasis, that he would come but to lay his head\nin his grave.\n\nAs he was descending the stairs, Laura, who never forgot in selfish\nfeeling to provide for the comfort of others, followed him, to beg that\nwhen he had leisure, he would write to her father. Laura blushed and\nhesitated as she made this request, not because she had in making it any\nselfish motive whatever, but purely because she was unused to ask\nfavours. Flattered by the request, but much more by her confusion, De\nCourcy glowed with pleasure. 'Certainly I shall write,' said he with\ngreat animation, 'if you--I mean if Captain Montreville wish it.' These\nwords, and the tone in which they were uttered, made Laura direct a look\nof inquiry to the speaker's face, where his thoughts were distinctly\nlegible; and she no sooner read then, than, stately and displeased, she\ndrew back. 'I believe it will give my father pleasure to hear from you,\nsir,' said she, and coldly turned away. 'Is there no man,' thought she,\n'exempt from this despicable vanity--from the insignificant Warren to\nthe respectable De Courcy?' Poor Montague would fain have besought her\nforgiveness for his presumption in supposing it possible that she could\nhave any pleasure in hearing of him; but the look with which she turned\nfrom him, left him no courage to speak to her again, and he mournfully\npursued his way to Audley Street.\n\nHe was scarcely gone when Warren called, and Laura, very little\ndispleased for his company, took shelter in her own room. Her father,\nhowever, suffered no inconvenience from being left alone to the task of\nentertaining his visitor, for Warren found means to make the\nconversation sufficiently interesting.\n\nHe began by lamenting the Captain's long detention from his home, and\ncondoled with him upon the effects which London air had produced upon\nhis health. He regretted that Mr Williams's absence from town had\nretarded the final settlement of Montreville's business; informed him\nthat Mr Baynard's executors had appointed an agent to inspect his\npapers; and finally, surprised him by an unconditional offer to sign a\nnew bond for the annuity. He could not bear, he said, to think of the\nCaptain's being detained in London to the prejudice of his health,\nespecially as it was evident that Miss Montreville's suffered from the\nsame cause. He begged that a regular bond might be drawn up, which he\nwould sign at a moment's notice, and which he would trust to the\nCaptain's honour to destroy, if it should be found that the \u00c2\u00a31500,\nmentioned as the price of the annuity, had never been paid.\n\nAt this generous proposal, surprise and joy almost deprived Montreville\nof the power of utterance; gratefully clasping Warren's hand, 'Oh, sir,'\nhe exclaimed, 'you have, I hope, secured an independence for my child. I\nthank you--with what fervour, you can never know till you are yourself a\nfather.' Seemingly anxious to escape from his thanks, Warren again\npromised that he would be ready to sign the bond on the following day,\nor as soon as it was ready for signature. Captain Montreville again\nbegan to make acknowledgements, but Warren, who appeared rather\ndistressed than gratified by them, took his leave, and left the Captain\nto the joyful task of communicating the news to Laura.\n\nShe listened with grateful pleasure. 'How much have I been to blame,'\nsaid she, 'for allowing myself to believe that a little vanity\nnecessarily excluded every kind and generous feeling. What a pity it is\nthat this man should condescend to such an effeminate attention to\ntrifles!' Lost to the expectation, almost to the desire of seeing\nHargrave, she had now no tie to London, but one which was soon to be\nbroken, for Mrs and Miss De Courcy were about to return to Norwood. With\nalmost unmixed satisfaction, therefore, she heard her father declare,\nthat in less than a week he should be on his way to Scotland. With\npleasure she looked forward to revisiting her dear Glenalbert, and\nanticipated the effects of its quiet shades and healthful air upon her\nfather. Already she beheld her home, peaceful and inviting, as when,\nfrom the hill that sheltered it, she last looked back upon its simple\nbeauties. She heard the ripple of its waters; she trod the well-known\npath; met the kind familiar face, and listened to the cordial welcome,\nwith such joy as they feel who return from the land of strangers.\n\nNor was Montreville less pleased with the prospect of returning to his\naccustomed comforts and employments--of feeling himself once more among\nobjects which he could call his own. His own! There was magic in the\nword, that transformed the cottage at Glenalbert into a fairy\npalace--the garden and the farm into a little world. To leave London\ninterfered indeed with his hopes of De Courcy as a lover for his\ndaughter; but he doubted not that the impression was already made, and\nthat Montague would follow Laura to Scotland.\n\nHis mind suddenly relieved from anxiety, his spirits rose, all his\nconstitutional good nature returned, and he caressed his daughter with a\nfondness that seemed intended to atone for the captious behaviour of the\nmorning. At dinner he called for wine, a luxury in which he rarely\nindulged, drank to their safe arrival at Glenalbert, and obliged Laura\nto pledge him to the health of Warren. To witness her father's\ncheerfulness was a pleasure which Laura had of late tasted so sparingly,\nthat it had the most exhilarating effect upon her spirits; and neither\nDe Courcy nor Hargrave would have been much gratified, could they have\nseen the gaiety with which she supported the absence of the one, and the\nneglect of the other.\n\nShe was beginning to enjoy one of those cheerful domestic evenings which\nhad always been her delight, when Miss Dawkins came to propose that she\nshould accompany her and her mother on a visit to Mrs Jones. Laura would\nhave excused herself, by saying, that she could not leave her father\nalone; but the Captain insisted upon her going, and declared that he\nwould himself be of the party. She had therefore no apology, and,\ndeprived of the amusement which she would have preferred, contentedly\nbetook herself to that which was within her reach. She did not sit in\nsilent contemplation of her own superiority, or of the vulgarity of her\ncompanions; nor did she introduce topics of conversation calculated to\nillustrate either; but having observed that even the most ignorant have\nsome subject on which they can talk with ease and pleasure, and even be\nheard with advantage, she suffered others to lead the discourse, rightly\nconjecturing that they would guide it to the channel which they judged\nmost favourable to their own powers. She was soon engaged with Mrs\nDawkins in a dissertation on various branches of household economy, and\nto the eternal degradation of her character as a heroine, actually\nlistened with interest to the means of improving the cleanliness,\nbeauty, and comfort of her dwelling.\n\nMrs Jones was highly flattered by the Captain's visit, and exerted\nherself to entertain him, her husband being inclined to taciturnity by a\nreason which Bishop Butler has pronounced to be a good one. Perceiving\nthat Montreville was an Englishman, she concluded that nothing but dire\nnecessity could have exiled him to Scotland. She inquired what town he\nlived in; and being answered that his residence was many miles distant\nfrom any town, she held up her hands in pity and amazement. But when she\nheard that Montreville had been obliged to learn the language of the\nHighlands, and that it was Laura's vernacular tongue, she burst into an\nexclamation of wonder. 'Mercy upon me,' cried she, 'can you make that\noutlandish spluttering so as them savages can know what you says? Well,\nif I had been among them a thousand years, I should never have made out\na word of their gibberish.'\n\n'The sound of it is very uncouth to a stranger,' said Captain\nMontreville, 'but now I have learnt to like it.' 'And do them there wild\nmen make you wear them little red and green petticoats?' asked Mrs\nJones, in a tone of compassionate inquiry. 'Oh no,' said Captain\nMontreville, 'they never interfered with my dress. But you seem quite\nacquainted with the Highlands. May I ask if you have been there?' 'Aye,\nthat I have, to my sorrow,' said Mrs Jones; and forthwith proceeded to\nrecount her adventures, pretty nearly in the same terms as she had\nformerly done to Laura. 'And what was the name of this unfortunate\nplace,' inquired the captain, when, having narrated the deficiency of\nhot rolls, Mrs Jones made the pause in which her auditors were\naccustomed to express their astonishment and horror. 'That was what I\nasked the waiter often and often,' replied she, 'but I could never make\nhead or tail of what he said. Sometimes it sounded like _A rookery_;\nsometimes like one thing, sometimes like another. So I takes the\nroadbook, and looks it out, and it looked something like A rasher, only\nnot right spelt. So, thinks I, they'll call it _A rasher_, because there\nis good bacon here; and I asked the man if they were famous for pigs;\nand he said, no, they got all their pigs from the manufactory in\nGlasgow, and that they weren't famous for any thing but fresh herrings,\nas are catched in that black Loch-Lomond, where they wanted me to go.'\n\n'Kate,' said Mr Jones, setting down his tea-cup, and settling his hands\nupon his knees, 'you know I think you're wrong about them herrings.' 'Mr\nJones,' returned the lady, with a look that shewed that the herrings had\nbeen the subject of former altercation, 'for certain the waiter told me\nthat they came out of the loch, and to what purpose should he tell lies\nabout it.' 'I tells you, Kate, that herrings come out of the sea,' said\nMr Jones. 'Well, that loch is a great fresh water sea,' said Mrs Jones.\n'Out of the salt sea,' insisted Mr Jones. 'Aye,' said Mrs Jones, 'them\nsalt herrings as we gets here, but it stands to reason, Mr Jones, that\nthe fresh herrings should come out of fresh water.' 'I say, cod is\nfresh, and does'n't it come out of the sea? answer me that, Mrs Jones.'\n'It is no wonder the cod is fresh,' returned the lady, 'when the\nfishmongers keep fresh water running on it day and night.' 'Kate, it's\nof no use argufying, I say herrings come out of the sea. What say you,\nSir?' turning to Captain Montreville. The Captain softened his verdict\nin the gentleman's favour, by saying, that Mrs Jones was right in her\naccount of the waiter's report, though the man, in speaking of 'the\nloch,' meant not Loch-Lomond, but an arm of the sea. 'I know'd it,' said\nMr Jones triumphantly, 'for haven't I read it in the newspaper as\nGovernment offers a reward to any body that'll put most salt upon them\nScotch herrings, and is'n't that what makes the salt so dear?' So having\nsettled this knotty point to his own satisfaction, Mr Jones again\napplied himself to his tea.\n\n'Did you return to Glasgow by the way of Loch-Lomond?' inquired Captain\nMontreville. 'Ay,' cried Mrs Jones, 'that was what the people of the inn\nwanted us to do; but then I looked out, and seed a matter of forty of\nthem there savages, with the little petticoats and red and white\nstockings, loitering and lolling about the inn-door, doing nothing in\nthe varsal world, except wait till it was dark to rob and murder us all,\nbless us! So, thinks I, let me once get out from among you in a whole\nskin, and catch me in the Highlands again; so as soon as the chaise\ncould be got, we just went the way we came.' 'Did you find good\naccommodation in Glasgow,' said the Captain. 'Yes,' replied Mrs Jones;\n'but after all, Captain, there's no country like our own;--do you know,\nI never got so much as a buttered muffin all the while I was in\nScotland?'\n\nThe conversation was here interrupted by an exclamation from Mrs\nDawkins, who, knowing that she had nothing new to expect in her\ndaughter's memoirs of her Scotish excursion, had continued to talk with\nLaura apart. 'Goodness me!' she cried, 'why Kate, as sure as eggs,\nhere's Miss never seed a play in all her life!' 'Never saw a play! Never\nsaw a play!' exclaimed the landlord and landlady at once. 'Well, that's\nso odd; but to be sure, poor soul, how should she, among them there\nhills.' 'Suppose,' said Mrs Jones, 'we should make a party, and go\ntonight.--We shall be just in time.' Laura was desirous to go: her\nfather made no objection; and Mr Jones, with that feeling of\ngood-natured self-complacency which most people have experienced,\narising from the discovery that another is new to a pleasure with which\nhe himself is familiar, offered, as he expressed it, 'to do the genteel\nthing, and treat her himself.'\n\nThe party was speedily arranged, and Laura soon found herself seated in\nthe pit of the theatre. The scene was quite new to her; for her\nignorance of public places was even greater than her companions had\ndiscovered it to be. She was dazzled with the glare of the lights, and\nthe brilliancy of the company, and confused with the murmur of\ninnumerable voices; but the curtain rose, and her attention was soon\nconfined to the stage. The play was the Gamester, the most domestic of\nour tragedies; and, in the inimitable representation of Mrs Beverly,\nLaura found an illusion strong enough to absorb for the time every\nfaculty of her soul. Of the actress she thought not; but she loved and\npitied Mrs Beverly with a fervour that made her insensible to the\namusement which she afforded to her companions. Meanwhile her\ncountenance, as beautiful, almost as expressive, followed every change\nin that of Mrs Siddons. She wept with her; listened, started, rejoiced\nwith her; and when Mrs Beverly repulsed the villain Stukely, Laura's\neyes too flashed with 'heaven's own lightnings.' By the time the\nrepresentation was ended, she was so much exhausted by the strength and\nrapidity of her emotions, that she was scarcely able to answer to the\nquestions of 'How have you been amused?' and 'How did you like it?' with\nwhich her companions all at once assailed her. 'Well,' said Miss Julia,\nwhen they were arrived at home, 'I think nothing is so delightful as a\nplay. I should like to go every night--shouldn't you?' 'No,' answered\nLaura. 'Once or twice in a year would be quite sufficient for me. It\noccupies my thoughts too much for a mere amusement.'\n\nIn the course of the two following days, Laura had sketched more than\ntwenty heads of Mrs Siddons, besides completing the preparations for her\njourney to Scotland. On the third, the Captain, who could now smile at\nhis own imaginary debility, prepared to carry the bond to receive Mr\nWarren's signature. The fourth was to be spent with Mrs De Courcy; and\non the morning of the fifth, the travellers intended to depart.\n\nOn the appointed morning, Captain Montreville set out on an early visit\nto Portland Street, gaily telling his daughter at parting that he would\nreturn in an hour or two, with her dowery in his pocket. When he knocked\nat Mr Warren's door, the servant informed him that his master had gone\nout, but that expecting the Captain to call, he had left a message to\nbeg that Montreville would wait till he returned, which would be very\nsoon.\n\nThe Captain was then shewn into a back parlour, where he endeavoured to\namuse himself with some books that were scattered round the room. They\nconsisted of amatory poems and loose novels, and one by one he threw\nthem aside in disgust, lamenting that one who was capable of a kind and\ngenerous action should seek pleasure in such debasing studies. The room\nwas hung with prints and pictures, but they partook of the same\nlicentious character; and Montreville shuddered, as the momentary\nthought darted across his mind, that it was strange that the charms of\nLaura had made no impression on one whose libertinism in regard to her\nsex was so apparent. It was but momentary. 'No!' thought he, 'her purity\nwould awe the most licentious; and I am uncandid, ungrateful, to harbour\neven for a moment such an idea of the man who has acted towards her and\nme with the most disinterested benevolence.'\n\nHe waited long, but Warren did not appear; and he began to blame himself\nfor having neglected to fix the exact time of his visit. To remedy this\nomission, he rang for writing materials, and telling the servant that he\ncould stay no longer, left a note to inform Mr Warren that he would wait\nupon him at twelve o'clock next day. The servant, who was Mr Warren's\nown valet, seemed unwilling to allow the Captain to depart, and assured\nhim that he expected his master every minute; but Montreville, who knew\nthat there was no depending upon the motions of a mere man of pleasure,\nwould be detained no longer.\n\nHe returned home, and finding the parlour empty, was leaving it to seek\nLaura in her painting-room, when he observed a letter lying on the\ntable addressed to himself. The hand-writing was new to him. He opened\nit--the signature was equally so. The contents were as follows:--\n\n       'Sir,\n\n     The writer of this letter is even by name a stranger to you. If\n     this circumstance should induce you to discredit my\n     information, I offer no proof of my veracity but this simple\n     one, that obviously no selfish end can be served by my present\n     interference. Of the force of my motive you cannot judge,\n     unless you have yourself lured to destruction the heart that\n     trusted you,--seen it refuse all comfort,--reject all\n     reparation,--and sink at last in untimely decay. From a fate\n     like this, though not softened like this by anxious tenderness,\n     nor mourned like this by remorseless pity, but aggravated by\n     being endured for one incapable of any tender or generous\n     feeling, it is my purpose, Sir, to save your daughter. I was\n     last night one of a party where her name was mentioned;--where\n     she was described as lovely, innocent, and respectable; yet the\n     person who so described her, scrupled not to boast of a plan\n     for her destruction. In the hope (why should I pretend a better\n     motive) of softening the pangs of late but bitter\n     self-reproach, by saving one fellow-creature from perhaps\n     reluctant ruin, one family from domestic shame, I drew from him\n     your address, and learnt that to ingratiate himself with you,\n     and with his intended victim, he has pretended to offer as a\n     gift, what he knew that he could not long withhold. He means to\n     take the earliest opportunity of inveigling her from your care,\n     secure, as he boasts, of her pardon in her attachment. Ill,\n     indeed, does her character, even as described by him, accord\n     with such a boast; yet even indifference might prove no guard\n     against fraud, which, thus warned, you may defy. A fear that my\n     intention should be frustrated by the merited contempt attached\n     to anonymous information, inclines me to add my name, though\n     aware that it can claim no authority with a stranger.\n\n      'I am, SIR,\n        'Your obedient Servant,\n            'PHILIP WILMOT.'\n\nCaptain Montreville read this letter more than once. It bore marks of\nsuch sincerity that he knew not how to doubt of the intelligence it\ngave; and he perceived with dismay, that the business which he had\nconsidered as closed, was as far as ever from a conclusion; for how\ncould he accept a favour which he had been warned to consider as the\nwages of dishonour. For Laura he had indeed no fear. She was no less\nsafe in her own virtue and discretion, than in the contemptuous pity\nwith which she regarded Warren. This letter would put her upon her guard\nagainst leaving the house with him, which Captain Montreville now\nrecollected that he had often solicited her to do, upon pretence of\ntaking the air in his curricle.\n\nBut must he still linger in London; still be cheated with vain hopes;\nstill fear for the future subsistence of his child; still approach the\nvery verge of poverty; perhaps be obliged to defend his rights by a\ntedious law-suit? His heart sank at the prospect, and he threw himself\non a seat, disconsolate and cheerless.\n\nHe had long been in the habit of seeking relief from every painful\nfeeling in the tenderness of Laura,--of finding in her enduring spirit a\nsupport to the weakness of his own; and he now sought her in the\nconviction that she would either discover some advantage to be drawn\nfrom this disappointment, or lighten it to him by her affectionate\nsympathy. He knocked at the door.--She did not answer. He called\nher.--All was silent. He rang the bell, and inquired whether she was\nbelow, and was answered that she had gone out with Mr Warren in his\ncurricle two hours before. The unfortunate father heard no more. Wildly\nstriking his hand upon his breast, 'She is lost!' he cried, and sunk to\nthe ground. The blood burst violently from his mouth and nostrils, and\nhe became insensible.\n\nThe family were soon assembled round him; and a surgeon being procured,\nhe declared that Montreville had burst a blood vessel, and that nothing\nbut the utmost care and quiet could save his life. Mrs Dawkins, with\ngreat humanity, attended him herself, venting in whispers to the surgeon\nher compassion for Montreville, and her indignation against the\nunnatural desertion of Laura, whom she abused as a methodistical\nhypocrite, against whom her wrath was the stronger because she could\nnever have suspected her.\n\nMontreville no sooner returned to recollection, than he declared his\nresolution instantly to set off in search of his child. In vain did the\nsurgeon expostulate, and assure him that his life would be the forfeit:\nhis only answer was, 'Why should I live? She is lost.' In pursuance of\nhis design, he tried to rise from the bed on which he had been laid; but\nexhausted nature refused to second him, and again he sunk back\ninsensible.\n\nWhen Montreville called in Portland Street, the servant had deceived him\nin saying that Warren was not at home. He was not only in the house,\nbut expected the Captain's visit, and prepared to take advantage of it,\nfor the accomplishment of the honourable scheme of which he had boasted\nto his associates. As soon, therefore, as the servant had disposed of\nMontreville, Warren mounted his curricle, which was in waiting at a\nlittle distance, and driving to Mrs Dawkins's, informed Laura that he\nhad been sent to her by her father, who proposed carrying her to see the\nBritish Museum, and for that purpose was waiting her arrival in Portland\nStreet. Entirely unsuspicious of any design, Laura accompanied him\nwithout hesitation; and though Portland Street appeared to her greatly\nmore distant than she had imagined it, it was not till having taken\ninnumerable turns, she found herself in an open road, that she began to\nsuspect her conductor of having deceived her.\n\n'Whither have you taken me, Mr Warren?' she inquired: 'This road does\nnot lead to Portland Street.' 'Oh yes, it does,' answered Warren, 'only\nthe road is a little circuitous.' 'Let us immediately return to the\nstraight one then,' said Laura. 'My father will be alarmed, and conclude\nthat some accident has happened to us.' 'Surely, my charming Miss\nMontreville,' said Warren, still continuing to drive on, 'you do not\nfear to trust yourself with me.' 'Fear _you_!' repeated Laura, with\ninvoluntary disdain. 'No, but I am at a loss to guess what has\nencouraged you to make me the companion of so silly a frolic. I suppose\nyou mean this for an ingenious joke upon my father.' 'No, 'pon my soul,'\nsaid the beau, a little alarmed by the sternness of her manner, 'I meant\nnothing but to have an opportunity of telling you that I am quite in\nlove with you,--dying for you,--faith I am.' 'You should first have\nascertained,' answered Laura, 'whether I was likely to think the secret\nworth a hearing. I desire you will instantly return.'\n\nThe perfect composure of Laura's look and manner (for feeling no alarm\nshe shewed none) made Warren conclude that she was not averse to being\ndetained; and he thought it only necessary that he should continue to\nmake love, to induce her quietly to submit to go on for another half\nmile, which would bring them to a place where he thought she would be\nsecure. He began, therefore, to act the lover with all the energy he\ncould muster; but Laura interrupted him. 'It is a pity,' said she, with\na smile of calm contempt, 'to put a stop to such well-timed gallantry,\nwhich is indeed just such as I should have expected from Mr Warren's\nsense and delicacy. But I would not for the sake of Mr Warren's\nraptures, nor all else that he has to offer, give my father the most\nmomentary pain, and therefore if you do not suffer me to alight this\ninstant, I shall be obliged to claim the assistance of passengers on an\noccasion very little worthy of their notice.' Her contumelious manner\nentirely undeceived her companion in regard to her sentiments; but it\nhad no other effect upon him, except that of adding revenge to the\nnumber of his incitements; and perceiving that they were now at a short\ndistance from the house whither he intended to convey her, he continued\nto pursue his way.\n\nLaura now rose from her seat, and seizing the reins with a force that\nmade the horses rear, she coolly chose that moment to spring from the\ncurricle; and walked back towards the town, leaving her inammorato in\nthe utmost astonishment at her self-possession, as well as rage at her\ndisdainful treatment.\n\nShe proceeded till she came to a decent-looking shop, where she entered;\nand, begging permission to sit down, dispatched one of the shop-boys in\nsearch of a hackney-coach. A carriage was soon procured, and Laura,\nconcluding that her father, tired of waiting for her, must have left\nPortland Street, desired to be driven directly home.\n\nAs she entered the house, she was met by Mrs Dawkins. 'So Miss,' cried\nshe, 'you have made a fine spot of work on't. You have murdered your\nfather.' 'Good heavens!' cried Laura, turning as pale as death, 'what is\nit you mean? where is my father?' 'Your father is on his deathbed Miss,\nand you may thank your morning rides for it. Thinking you were off, he\nburst a blood-vessel in the fright, and the doctor says, the least stir\nin the world will finish him.'\n\nLaura turned sick to death. Cold drops stood upon her forehead; and she\nshook in every limb. She made an instinctive attempt to ascend the\nstair; but her strength failed her, and she sunk upon the steps. The\nsight of her agony changed in a moment Mrs Dawkins's indignation to\npity. 'Don't take on so, Miss,' said she, 'to be sure you didn't mean\nit. If he is kept quiet, he may mend still, and now that you're come\nback too.--By the bye, I may as well run up and tell him.' 'Oh stop!'\ncried Laura, reviving at once in the sudden dread that such incautious\nnews would destroy her father, 'Stay,' said she, pressing with one hand\nher bursting forehead, while with the other she detained Mrs\nDawkins.--'Let me think, that we may not agitate him. Oh no! I cannot\nthink;' and leaning her head on Mrs Dawkins' shoulder, she burst into an\nagony of tears.\n\nThese salutary tears restored her recollection, and she inquired\nwhether the surgeon, of whom Mrs Dawkins had spoken, was still in the\nhouse. Being answered, that he was in Montreville's apartment, she sent\nto beg that he would speak with her. He came, and she entreated him to\ninform her father, with the caution which his situation required, that\nshe was returned and safe. She followed him to the door of Montreville's\napartment, and stood listening in trembling expectation to every thing\nthat stirred within. At last she received the wished-for summons. She\nentered; she sprang towards the bed. 'My child!' cried Montreville, and\nhe clasped her to his bosom, and sobbed aloud. When he was able to\nspeak, 'Oh Laura,' said he, 'tell me again that you are safe, and say by\nwhat miracle, by what unheard-of mercy, you have escaped.' 'Compose\nyourself, my dearest father, for Heaven's sake,' cried Laura. 'I am\nindeed safe, and never have been in danger. When Warren found that I\nrefused to join in his frolic, he did not attempt to prevent me from\nreturning home.' She then briefly related the affair as it had appeared\nto her, suppressing Warren's rhapsodies, from the fear of irritating her\nfather; and he, perceiving that she considered the whole as a frolic,\nfrivolous in its intention, though dreadful in its effects, suffered her\nto remain in that persuasion. She passed the night by his bed-side,\ndevoting every moment of his disturbed repose to fervent prayers for his\nrecovery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nFrom feverish and interrupted sleep, Montreville awoke unrefreshed; and\nthe surgeon, when he repeated his visit, again alarmed Laura with\nrepresentations of her father's danger, and assurances that nothing but\nthe most vigilant attention to his quiet could preserve his life. The\nanguish with which Laura listened to this sentence she suppressed, lest\nit should injure her father. She never approached him but to bring\ncomfort; she spoke to him cheerfully, while the tears forced themselves\nto her eyes; and smiled upon him while her heart was breaking. She felt\nwhat he must suffer, should the thought occur to him that he was about\nto leave her to the world, unfriended and alone; and she never mentioned\nhis illness to him unless with the voice of hope. But of the danger\nwhich she strove to disguise, Montreville was fully sensible; and though\nhe forbore to shock her by avowing it explicitly, he could not, like\nher, suppress his fears. He would sometimes fervently wish that he could\nsee his child safe in the protection of Mrs Douglas; and sometimes, when\nLaura was bending over him in the tenderest sympathy, he would clasp her\nneck, and cry, with an agony that shook his whole frame, 'What--Oh what\nwill become of thee!'\n\nHe seemed anxious to know how long Mrs De Courcy was to remain in town,\nand inquired every hour whether Montague was not returned. Full well did\nLaura guess the mournful meaning of these questions. Full well did they\nremind her, that when the De Courcy family left London, she with her\ndying father would amidst this populous wilderness be alone. She\nanticipated the last scene of this sad tragedy; when, amidst busy\nthousands, a senseless corpse would be her sole companion. She looked\nforward to its close, when even this sad society would be withdrawn.\nHuman fortitude could not support the prospect; and she would rush from\nher father's presence, to give vent to agonies of sorrow.\n\nBut the piety of Laura could half-invest misfortune with the character\nof blessing; as the mists that rise to darken the evening sun are\nthemselves tinged with his glory. She called to mind the gracious\nassurance which marks the afflicted who suffer not by their own guilt or\nfolly as the favoured of Heaven; and the more her earthly connections\nseemed dissolving, the more did she strive to acquaint herself with Him,\nfrom whose care no accident can sever. To this care she fervently\ncommitted her father; praying that no selfish indulgence of her grief\nmight embitter his departure; and resolving by her fortitude to convince\nhim that she was able to struggle with the storm from which he was no\nlonger to shelter her.\n\nThe day succeeding that on which Montreville was taken ill had been set\napart for a farewell visit to Mrs De Courcy; and Laura's note of\nmournful apology, was answered by a kind visit from Harriet. Unconscious\nof the chief cause of her father's impatience for Montague's return,\nLaura wishing to be the bearer of intelligence which she knew would\ncheer him, inquired anxiously when Miss De Courcy expected her brother.\nBut De Courcy's motions depended upon the spirits of his venerable\nfriend, and Harriet knew not when he might be able to leave Mr\nWentworth. It was even uncertain whether for the present he would return\nto town at all, as in another week Mrs De Courcy meant to set out for\nNorwood. Laura softened this unpleasing news to her father; she did not\nname the particular time of Mrs De Courcy's departure, and she suffered\nhim still confidently to expect the return of his favourite.\n\nThe next day brought a letter from De Courcy himself, full of\naffectionate solicitude for the Captain's health and spirits; but\nevidently written in ignorance of the fatal change that had taken place\nsince his departure. In this letter the name of Laura was not mentioned,\nnot even in a common compliment, and Montreville remarked to her this\nomission. 'He has forgotten it,' answered Laura,--'his warm heart is\nfull of his friend's distress and yours, and has not room for more\nceremony.' 'I hope,' said Montreville, emphatically, 'that is not the\nreason.' 'What is then the reason?' inquired Laura; but Montreville did\nnot speak, and she thought no more of De Courcy's little omission.\n\nHer father, indeed, for the present, occupied almost all her earthly\nthoughts, and even her prayers rose more frequently for him than for\nherself. Except during the visits of Montreville's surgeon, she was\nMontreville's sole attendant; and, regardless of fatigue, she passed\nevery night by his bed-side, every day in ministering to his comfort.\nIf, worn out with watching, she dropt asleep, she started again at his\nslightest motion, and obstinately refused to seek in her own chamber a\nless interrupted repose. 'No,' thought she, 'let my strength serve me\nwhile I have duties to perform, while my father lives to need my\nefforts; then may I be permitted to sink to early rest, and the weary\nlabourer, while yet it is but mornings be called to receive his hire.'\n\nThe desertion of Hargrave, whom she had loved with all the ardour of a\nwarm heart and a fervid imagination, the death of her father so fast\napproaching, her separation from every living being with whom she could\nclaim friendship or kindred, seemed signals for her to withdraw her\naffections from a world where she would soon have nothing left to love\nor to cherish. 'And be it so,' thought she,--'let me no longer grovel\nhere in search of objects which earth has not to offer--objects fitted\nfor unbounded and unchangeable regard. Nor let me peevishly reject what\nthis world really has to give, the opportunity to prepare for a better.\nThis it bestows even on me; and a few childish baubles are all else that\nit reserves for those who worship it with all their soul, and strength,\nand mind.'\n\nNo mortal can exist without forming some wish or hope. Laura _hoped_\nthat she should live while she could be useful to her father; and she\n_wished_ that she might not survive him. One only other wish she had,\nand that was for De Courcy's return; for Montreville, whose spirits more\nthan shared his bodily languor, now seldom spoke, but to express his\nlonging for the presence of his favourite. Laura continued to cheer him\nwith a hope which she herself no longer felt; for now three days only\nremained ere Mrs De Courcy was to quit London. The departure of their\nfriends Laura resolved to conceal from her father, that, believing them\nto be near, he might feel himself the less forlorn; and this she thought\nmight be practicable, as he had never since his illness expressed any\nwish to quit his bed, or to see Miss De Courcy when she came.\n\nIn Montreville's darkened apartment, without occupation but in her cares\nfor him, almost without rest, had Laura passed a week, when she was one\nmorning summoned from her melancholy charge, to attend a visitor. She\nentered the parlour. 'Mr De Courcy!' she exclaimed, springing joyfully\nto meet him, 'thank Heaven you are come!' But not with equal warmth did\nDe Courcy accost her. The repulsive look she had given him at parting\nwas still fresh in his recollection; and, with a respectful distant bow,\nhe expressed his sorrow for Captain Montreville's illness. 'Oh he is\nill, indeed!' said Laura, the faint hectic of pleasure fading suddenly\nfrom her cheek. 'Earnestly has he longed for your return; and we\nfeared,' said she, with a violent effort suppressing her tears, 'we\nfeared that you might not have come till--till all was over.' 'Surely\nMiss Montreville,' said De Courcy, extremely shocked, 'surely you are\ncauselessly alarmed.' 'Oh no,' cried Laura, 'he cannot live!' and no\nlonger able to contain her emotion, she burst into a passion of tears.\nForced entirely from his guard by her grief, Montague threw himself on\nthe seat beside her. 'Dearest of human beings,' he exclaimed, 'Oh that I\ncould shield thee from every sorrow!' But absorbed in her distress,\nLaura heeded him not; and the next moment, sensible of his imprudence,\nhe started from her side, and retreated to a distant part of the room.\n\nAs soon as she was again able to command herself, she went to inform her\nfather of De Courcy's arrival. Though told with the gentlest caution,\nMontreville heard the news with extreme emotion. He grasped Laura's\nhand; and, with tears of joy streaming down his pale cheeks,\nsaid,--'Heaven be praised! I shall not leave thee quite desolate.' Laura\nherself felt less desolate and she rejoiced even for herself, when she\nonce more saw De Courcy seated beside her father.\n\nIt was only the morning before, that a letter from Harriet had informed\nher brother of Montreville's illness and of Laura's distress. To hear of\nthat distress, and to remain at a distance was impossible; and Montague\nhad left Mr Wentworth's within the hour. He had travelled all night;\nand, without even seeing his mother and sister, had come directly to\nCaptain Montreville's lodgings. He was shocked at the death-like looks\nof Montreville, and still more at those of Laura. Her eyes were sunk,\nher lips colourless, and her whole appearance indicated that she was\nworn out with fatigue and wretchedness. Yet De Courcy felt, that never\nin the bloom of health and beauty, had she been so dear to him, and\nscarcely could he forbear from addressing her in the accents of\ncompassion and love. Montreville wishing to speak with him alone, begged\nof Laura to leave him for a while to De Courcy's care, and endeavour to\ntake some rest. She objected that Montague had himself need of rest,\nhaving travelled all night; but when he assured her, that even if she\ndrove him away he would not attempt to sleep, she consented to retire,\nand seek the repose of which she was so much in want.\n\nWhen they were alone, Montreville shewed De Courcy the warning letter;\nand related to him the baseness of Warren and Laura's escape. Montague\nlistened to him with intense interest. He often changed colour, and his\nlips quivered with emotion; and, when her father described the manner in\nwhich she had accomplished her escape, he exclaimed with enthusiasm,\n'Yes, she is superior to every weakness, as she is alive to every gentle\nfeeling.' Montreville then dwelt upon her unremitting care of him--on\nthe fortitude with which she suppressed her sorrow, even while its\nviolence was perceptibly injuring her health. 'And is it to be wondered\nat,' said he, 'that I look forward with horror to leaving this lovely\nexcellent creature in such a world, alone and friendless?' 'She shall\nnever be friendless,' cried De Courcy. 'My mother, my sister, shall be\nher friends, and I will'--He stopped abruptly, and a heavy sigh burst\nfrom him.\n\nRecovering himself, he resumed, 'You must not talk so despondingly. You\nwill live long, I trust, to enjoy the blessing of such a child.'\nMontreville shook his head, and remained silent. He was persuaded that\nDe Courcy loved his daughter, and would fain have heard an explicit\navowal that he did. To have secured to her the protection of Montague\nwould have destroyed the bitterness of death. Had Laura been the heiress\nof millions, he would have rejoiced to bestow her and them upon De\nCourcy. But he scorned to force him to a declaration, and respected her\ntoo much to make an approach towards offering her to any man's\nacceptance.\n\nHe was at a loss to imagine what reason withheld De Courcy from avowing\nan attachment which he was convinced that he felt. When he considered\nhis favourite's grave reflecting character, he was rather inclined to\nbelieve that he was cautiously ascertaining the temper and habits of the\nwoman with whom he meant to spend his life. But the warmth of\napprobation with which he mentioned Laura, seemed to indicate that his\nopinion of her was already fixed. It was possible, too, that De Courcy\nwished to secure an interest in her regard before he ventured formally\nto petition for it. Whatever was the cause of Montague's silence, the\nCaptain anticipated the happiest consequences from his renewed\nintercourse with Laura; and he resolved that he would not, by any\nindelicate interference, compel him to precipitate his declaration. He\ntherefore changed the conversation, by inquiring when Mrs De Courcy was\nto leave town. Montague answered, that as he had not seen his mother\nsince his return, he did not exactly know what time was fixed for her\ndeparture: 'but,' said he, 'whenever she goes, I shall only attend her\nto Norwood, and return on the instant; nor will I quit you again, till\nyou are much, much better, or till you will no longer suffer me to\nstay.' Montreville received this promise with gratitude and joy; and De\nCourcy persuaded himself, that in making it, he was actuated chiefly by\nmotives of friendship and humanity. He remained with Montreville till\nthe day was far advanced, and then went to take a late dinner in Audley\nStreet.\n\nNext morning, and for several succeeding days, he returned, and spent\nthe greatest part of his time in attending, comforting, and amusing the\ninvalid. He prevailed on his mother to delay her departure, that he\nmight not be obliged immediately to leave his charge. He soothed the\nlittle impatiences of disease; contrived means to mitigate the\noppressiveness of debility; knew how to exhilarate the hour of ease; and\nwatched the moment, well known to the sickly, when amusement becomes\nfatigue.\n\nLaura repaid these attentions to her father with gratitude unutterable.\nOften did she wish to thank De Courcy as he deserved; but she felt that\nher acknowledgements must fall far short of her feelings and of his\ndeserts, if they were not made with a warmth, which to a man, and to a\nyoung man, she revolted from expressing. She imagined, too, that to one\nwho sought for friendship, mere gratitude might be mortifying; and that\nit might wound the generous nature of Montague to be thanked as a\nbenefactor, where he wished to be loved as an equal. She therefore did\nnot speak of, or but slightly mentioned, her own and her father's\nobligations to him; but she strove to repay them in the way that would\nhave been most acceptable to herself, by every mark of confidence and\ngood will. Here no timidity restrained her; for no feeling that could\nexcite timidity at all mingled with her regard for De Courcy. But,\nconfined to her own breast, her gratitude became the stronger; and if\nshe had now had a heart to give, to Montague it would have been freely\ngiven.\n\nMeanwhile the spirits of Montreville lightened of a heavy load, by the\nassurance that, even in case of his death, his daughter would have a\nfriend to comfort and protect her, his health began to improve. He was\nable to rise; and one day, with the assistance of Montague's arm,\nsurprised Laura with a visit in the parlour. The heart of Laura swelled\nwith transport when she saw him once more occupy his accustomed seat in\nthe family-room, and received him as one returned from the grave. She\nsat by him, holding his hand between her own, but did not try to speak.\n'If it would not make you jealous, Laura,' said Montreville, 'I should\ntell you that Mr De Courcy is a better nurse than you are. I have\nrecruited wonderfully since he undertook the care of me. More indeed\nthan I thought I should ever have done.' Laura answered only by glancing\nupon De Courcy a look of heartfelt benevolence and pleasure. 'And yet,'\nsaid Montague, 'it is alleged that no attentions from our own sex are so\neffectual as those which we receive from the other. How cheaply would\nbodily suffering purchase the sympathy, the endearments of'--the name of\nLaura rose to his lips, but he suppressed it, and changed the expression\nto 'an amiable woman.' 'Is it indeed so?' cried Laura, raising her eyes\nfull of grateful tears to his face. 'Oh then, if sickness or sorrow must\nbe your portion, may your kindness here be repaid by some spirit of\npeace in woman's form--some gentleness yet more feminine than De\nCourcy's!'\n\nThe enthusiasm and gratitude had hurried Laura into a warmth which the\nnext moment covered her with confusion; and she withdrew her eyes from\nDe Courcy's face before she had time to remark the effect of these, the\nfirst words of emotion that ever she had addressed to him. The transport\nexcited by the ardour of her expressions, and the cordial approbation\nwhich they implied, instantly gave way to extreme mortification. 'She\nwishes,' thought he, 'that some _woman_ may repay me. She would then,\nnot only with indifference, but with pleasure, see me united to another;\nresign me without a pang to some mere common-place insipid piece of\nsweetness; and give her noble self to one who could better feel her\nvalue.'\n\nDe Courcy had never declared his preference for Laura; he was even\ndetermined not to declare it. Yet to find that she had not even a wish\nto secure it for herself, gave him such acute vexation, that he was\nunable to remain in her presence. He abruptly rose and took his leave.\nHe soon however reproached himself with the unreasonableness of his\nfeelings; and returned to his oft-repeated resolution to cultivate the\nfriendship without aspiring to the love of Laura. He even persuaded\nhimself that he rejoiced in her freedom from a passion which could not\nbe gratified without a sacrifice of the most important duties. He had a\nsister for whom no provision had been made; a mother, worthy of his\nwarmest affection, whose increasing infirmities required increased\nindulgence. Mrs De Courcy's jointure was a very small one; and though\nshe consented for the present to share the comforts of his\nestablishment, Montague knew her too well to imagine that she would\naccept of any addition to her income, deducted from the necessary\nexpences of his wife and family. His generous nature revolted from\nsuffering his sister to feel herself a mere pensioner on his bounty, or\nto seek dear-bought independence in a marriage of convenience, a sort of\nbargain upon which he looked with double aversion, since he had himself\nfelt the power of an exclusive attachment.\n\nHere even his sense of justice was concerned; for he knew that, if his\nfather had lived, it was his intention to have saved from his income a\nprovision for Harriet. From the time that the estate devolved to\nMontague, he had begun to execute his father's intention; and he had\nresolved, that no selfish purpose should interfere with its fulfilment.\nThe destined sum, however, was as yet little more than half collected,\nand it was now likely to accumulate still more slowly; for, as Mrs De\nCourcy had almost entirely lost the use of her limbs, a carriage was to\nher an absolute necessary of life.\n\nMost joyfully would Montague have sacrificed every luxury, undergone\nevery privation, to secure the possession of Laura; but he would not\nsacrifice his mother's health nor his sister's independence to any\nselfish gratification; nor would he subject the woman of his choice to\nthe endless embarrassments of a revenue too small for its purposes.\n\nThese reasons had determined him against addressing Laura. At their\nfirst interview he had been struck with her as the most lovely woman he\nhad ever beheld; but he was in no fear that his affections should be\nentangled. They had escaped from a hundred lovely women, who had done\ntheir utmost to ensnare them, while she was evidently void of any such\ndesign. Besides, Montreville was his old friend, and it was quite\nnecessary that he should visit him. Laura's manners had charmed De\nCourcy as much as her person. Still might not a man be pleased and\nentertained, without being in love? Further acquaintance gradually laid\nopen to him the great and amiable qualities of her mind, and was it not\nnatural and proper to love virtue? but this was not being in love.\n\nSymptoms at last grew so strong upon poor De Courcy, that he could no\nlonger disguise them from himself; but it was pleasing to love\nexcellence. He would never reveal his passion. It should be the secret\njoy of his heart; and why cast away a treasure which he might enjoy\nwithout injury to any? Laura's love indeed he could not seek; but her\nfriendship he might cherish; and who would exchange the friendship of\nsuch a woman for the silly fondness of a thousand vulgar minds?\n\nIn this pursuit he had all the success that he could desire; for Laura\ntreated him with undisguised regard; and with that regard he assured\nhimself that he should be satisfied. At last this 'secret joy,' this\n'treasure of his heart' began to mingle pain with its pleasures; and,\nwhen called away on his mournful errand to Mr Wentworth, De Courcy\nconfessed, that it was wise to wean himself a little from one whose\npresence was becoming necessary to his happiness, and to put some\nrestraint upon a passion, which from his toy was become his master.\nShort absence, however, had only increased his malady; and Laura in\nsorrow, Laura grateful, confiding, at times almost tender, seized at\nonce upon every avenue to the heart of De Courcy: he revered her as the\nbest, he admired her as the loveliest, he loved her as the most amiable\nof human beings. Still he resolved that, whatever it might cost him, he\nwould refrain from all attempt to gain her love; and he began to draw\nnice distinctions between the _very tender_ friendship with which he\nhoped to inspire her, and the tormenting passion which he must silently\nendure. Happily for the success of De Courcy's self-deceit, there was no\nrival at hand, with whose progress in Laura's regard he could measure\nhis own, and he never thought of asking himself what would be his\nsensations if her _very tender_ friendship for him should not exclude\nlove for another.\n\nA doubt would sometimes occur to him, as to the prudence of exposing\nhimself to the unremitting influence of her charms, but it was quickly\nbanished as an unwelcome intruder, or silenced with the plea, that, to\nwithdraw himself from Montreville on a sick-bed, would outrage\nfriendship and humanity. He had, too, somewhat inadvertently, given his\nfriend a promise that he would not leave him till his health was a\nlittle re-established; and this promise now served as the excuse for an\nindulgence which he had not resolution to forego. After escorting Mrs De\nCourcy to Norwood, he pleaded this promise to himself when he returned\nto London without an hour's delay; and it excused him in his own eyes\nfor going every morning to the abode of Montreville, from whence, till\nthe return of night drove him away, he had seldom the resolution to\ndepart.\n\nMeanwhile, with the health of her father, the spirits of Laura revived;\nand considering it as an act of the highest self-denial in a domestic\nman to quit his home--a literary man to suspend his studies--a young man\nto become stationary in the apartment of an invalid, she exerted herself\nto the utmost to cheer De Courcy's voluntary task. She sometimes\nrelieved him in reading aloud, an accomplishment in which she excelled.\nHer pronunciation was correct, her voice varied, powerful, and\nmelodious, her conception rapid and accurate, while the expression of\nher countenance was an animated comment upon the author.\n\nDe Courcy delighted to hear her sing the wild airs of her native\nmountains, which she did with inimitable pathos, though without skill.\nHer conversation, sometimes literary, sometimes gay, was always simply\nintended to please. Yet, though void of all design to dazzle, it\nhappened, she knew not how, that in De Courcy's company she was always\nmore lively, more acute, than at other times. His remarks seemed to\nunlock new stores in her mind; and the train of thought which he\nintroduced, she could always follow with peculiar ease and pleasure.\nSafe in her preference for another, she treated him with the most\ncordial frankness. Utterly unconscious of the sentiment she inspired,\nshe yet had an animating confidence in De Courcy's good will; and\nsometimes pleased herself with thinking, that, next to his mother and\nsister, she stood highest of women in his regard. No arts of the most\nrefined coquetry could have rivetted more closely the chains of the\nill-fated De Courcy; and the gratitude of the unconscious Laura, pointed\nthe shaft that gave the death wound to his peace.\n\nHow was it possible for her to imagine, that the same sentiment could\nproduce a demeanour so opposite as De Courcy's was from that of\nHargrave. Hargrave had been accustomed to speak of her personal charms\nwith rapture. De Courcy had never made them the subject of direct\ncompliment; he had even of late wholly discontinued those little\ngallantries which every pretty woman is accustomed to receive. Hargrave\nomitted no opportunity to plead his passion; and though the presence of\na third person of necessity precluded this topic, it restrained him not\nfrom gazing upon Laura with an eagerness from which she shrunk abashed.\nDe Courcy had never mentioned love; and Laura observed that, when his\nglance met her's, he would sometimes withdraw his eye with (as she\nthought) almost womanly modesty. In her private interviews with\nHargrave, he had ever approached her with as much vehemence and freedom\nof speech and manner, as her calm dignity would permit. Privacy made no\nchange in De Courcy's manner, except to render him a little more\nsilent--a little more distant; and to personal familiarity, he seemed to\nbe if possible more averse than herself; for if she accidentally touched\nhim, he coloured and drew back.\n\nSome of these circumstances Montreville had remarked, and had drawn from\nthem inferences very different from those of his daughter. He was\nconvinced that the preference of De Courcy for Laura had risen into a\npassion, which, for some unknown reason, he wished to conceal; and he\nperceived, by the ease of her behaviour, that Montague's secret was\nunsuspected by her. Most anxiously did he wish to know the cause of his\nfavourite's silence, and to discover whether it was likely to operate\nlong. In Laura's absence, he sometimes led the conversation towards the\nsubject; but De Courcy never improved the offered opportunity. Partly in\nthe hope of inviting equal frankness, Montreville talked of his own\nsituation, and mentioned the motive of his journey to London. Montague\ninquired into every particular of the business, and rested not till he\nhad found Mr Baynard's executor, and received from him an\nacknowledgement, that he had in his possession a voucher for the payment\nof Montreville's fifteen hundred pounds to Warren.\n\nHe next, without mentioned the matter to the Captain, called upon\nWarren, with an intention finally to conclude the business; thinking it\nimpossible that, since the payment of the money was ascertained, he\ncould refuse either to pay the annuity, or refund the price of it. But\nthe disdain of Laura yet rankled in the mind of Warren, and he\npositively refused to bring the affair to any conclusion, declaring,\nthat he would litigate it to the last sixpence he was worth; to which\ndeclaration he added an excellent joke concerning the union of Scotch\npride with Scotch poverty. At this effrontery the honest blood of De\nCourcy boiled with indignation, and he was on the point of vowing, that\nhe too would beggar himself, rather than permit such infamous\noppression; but his mother, his sister, and Laura herself, rose to his\nmind, and he contented himself with threatening to expose Warren to the\ndisgrace that he merited.\n\nWarren now began to suspect that De Courcy was the cause of Laura's\ncontemptuous reception of his addresses, and, enraged at his\ninterference, yet overawed by his manly appearance and decided manner,\nbecame sullen, and refused to answer Montague's expostulations. Nothing\nremained to be done, and De Courcy was obliged to communicate to\nMontreville the ill success of his negotiations.\n\nBereft of all hope of obtaining justice, which he had not the means to\nenforce, Montreville became more anxiously desirous to regain such a\ndegree of health as might enable him to return home. In his present\nstate, such a journey was impracticable, and he was convinced, that\nwhile he remained pent up in the polluted air of the city, his recovery\ncould advance but slowly. Some weeks must at all events elapse before he\ncould be in a condition to travel; and to accommodate his funds to this\nprolonged demand upon them, he saw that he must have recourse to some\nscheme of economy yet more humble than that which he had adopted.\n\nHe hoped, if he could recover strength sufficient for the search, to\nfind in the suburbs some abode of purer air, and still more moderate\nexpense than his present habitation. The former only of these motives he\nmentioned to De Courcy; for though Montreville did not affect to be\nrich, he never spoke of his poverty. Various circumstances, however, had\nled De Courcy to guess at his friend's pecuniary embarrassment; and he\ntoo had a motive which he did not avow, in the offer which he made to\nsecure a more healthful residence for Montreville.\n\nUnwilling to describe the humble accommodation with which he meant to\ncontent himself, or the limited price which he could afford to offer for\nit, Montreville at first refused De Courcy's services; but they were\npressed upon him with such warmth, that he was obliged to submit, and\nMontague lost no time in fulfilling his commission.\n\nHe soon discovered a situation that promised comfort. It was in the\noutskirts of the town, a small flower-garden belonged to the house, the\napartments were airy and commodious, the furniture was handsome, and the\nwhole most finically neat. The rent, however, exceeded that of\nMontreville's present lodgings; and De Courcy knew that this objection\nwould be insurmountable. That Laura should submit to the inelegancies of\na mean habitation, was what he could not bear to think of; and he\ndetermined, by a friendly little artifice, to reconcile Montreville's\ncomfort with his economy. The surgeon had named two or three weeks as\nthe time likely to elapse before Montreville could commence his journey.\nDe Courcy paid in advance above half the rent of the apartments for a\nmonth, charging the landlady to keep the real rent a secret from her\nlodgers.\n\nAs far as the author of these memoirs has been able to learn, this was\nthe only artifice that ever Montague De Courcy practised in his life;\nand it led, as artifices are wont to do, to consequences which the\ncontriver neither wished nor foresaw.\n\nMuch to his satisfaction, Montreville was soon settled in his new abode,\nwhere De Courcy continued to be his daily visitor. A certain delicacy\nprevented Laura from endeavouring to procure a reversal of her father's\ndecree, issued in a moment of peevishness, that she should paint no more\nwith a view to pecuniary reward. She felt that he had been wrong, and\nshe shrunk from reminding him of it, till her labours should again\nbecome necessary. But, desirous to convey to Mrs De Courcy some token of\nher remembrance and gratitude, she employed some of the hours which\nMontague spent with her father, in labouring a picture which she\nintended to send to Norwood. The subject was the choice of Hercules; and\nto make her gift the more acceptable, she presented in the hero a\npicture of De Courcy, while the form and countenance of Virtue, were\ncopied from the simple majesty of her own. The figure of Pleasure was a\nfancied one, and it cost the fair artist unspeakable labour. She could\nnot pourtray what she would have shrunk from beholding--a female\nvoluptuary. Her draperies were always designed with the most chastened\ndecency; and, after all her toil, even the form of Pleasure came sober\nand matronly from the hand of Laura.\n\nDesigning a little surprise for her friends, she had never mentioned\nthis picture to De Courcy; and as she daily stole some of the hours of\nhis visits to bestow upon it, it advanced rapidly. Montague bore these\nabsences with impatience; but Montreville, who knew how Laura was\nemployed, took no notice of them, and De Courcy durst not complain.\n\nThree weeks had glided away since Montreville's removal to his new\nlodgings, and he remained as much as ever anxious, and as much as ever\nunable to guess the reason which induced De Courcy to conceal a passion\nwhich evidently increased every day. He recollected that Montague had of\nlate never met Laura but in his presence, and he thought it natural that\nthe lover should wish to make his first application to his mistress\nherself. He had an idea, that the picture might be made to assist the\ndenouement which he so ardently desired; and with this view he privately\ngave orders that when next Mr De Courcy came he should be ushered into\nthe painting-room, which he knew would be empty, as Laura never quitted\nhim till De Courcy arrived to take her place.\n\nNext morning accordingly Montague was shewn into the room which he had\nhimself destined for Laura, and, for that reason, supplied with many\nlittle luxuries which belonged not to its original furniture. He looked\nround with delight on the marks of her recent presence. There lay her\nbook open as she had quitted it, and the pencil with which she had\nmarked the margin. It was one which he himself had recommended, and he\nthought it should ever be dear to him. On a table lay her port-folio and\ndrawing materials: in a corner stood her easel with the picture, over\nwhich was thrown a shawl which he had seen her wear.\n\nNot conceiving that she could have any desire to conceal her work, he\napproached it, and, raising the cover, stood for a moment motionless\nwith surprise. The next, a thousand sensations, vague but delightful,\ndarted through his mind; but before he could give a shape or\ndistinctness to any one of them, the step approached that ever aroused\nDe Courcy to eager expectation, and letting drop the shawl, he flew\ntowards the door to receive Laura.\n\nWith rapture in his eyes, but confusion on his tongue, De Courcy paid\nhis compliments, and again turned towards the picture. Laura sprung\nforward to prevent him from raising the covering. 'Is this forbidden,\nthen?' said he. 'Oh yes, indeed,' said Laura, blushing, 'you must not\nlook at it.' 'Can you be so mischievous,' cried De Courcy, a delighted\nsmile playing on his countenance, 'as to refuse me such a pleasure?' 'I\nam sure,' said Laura, blushing again, and still more deeply, 'it could\ngive you no pleasure in its present state.' 'And I am sure,' said De\nCourcy, ardently, 'it would give me more than I have language to\nexpress.'\n\nDe Courcy's eagerness, and the consciousness of her own confusion, made\nLaura now more unwilling that Montague should discover the cause of both\nto be his own portrait, and actually trembling with emotion, she said,\nputting her hand on the shawl to prevent him from raising it, 'Indeed I\ncannot shew you this. There is my port-folio--look at any thing but\nthis.' 'And what inference may I draw as to the subject of a picture\nthat Miss Montreville will not shew to the most partial--the most\ndevoted of her friends?' 'Any inference,' replied Laura, still holding\nthe shawl, 'that friendship or charity will permit.' 'And must I not\nremove this perverse little hand?' said De Courcy, laying his upon it;\nfor all prudence was forgotten in his present emotion. Laura, a little\noffended at his perseverance, gravely withdrew her hand, and turned\naway, saying, 'Since my wishes have no power, I shall make no other\ntrial of strength.' 'No power!' cried De Courcy, following her, 'they\nhave more force than a thousand arms.' 'Well,' said Laura, a little\nsurprised by his manner, but turning upon him a smile of gracious\nreconciliation, 'your forbearance may hereafter be rewarded by a sight\nof this important picture; but lest you should forfeit your recompense,\nhad we not better remove from temptation?'\n\nShe then led the way to the parlour, and De Courcy followed her in a\nstate of agitation that could not be concealed. He was absent and\nrestless. He often changed colour, seemed scarce sensible of what was\naddressed to him, or began to reply, and the unfinished sentence died\nupon his lips. At last, starting up, he pleaded sudden indisposition,\nand was hurrying away. 'Do not go away ill and alone,' said Laura,\nkindly detaining him. 'Walk round the garden--the fresh air will relieve\nyou.' 'No air will relieve me!' said De Courcy, in a voice of\nwretchedness. 'What then can we do for you?' said Laura, with\naffectionate earnestness. 'What can _you_ do for me!' cried De Courcy,\n'Oh nothing, nothing but suffer me to go, while yet I have the power.'\nHe then wrung Montreville's hand, and uttering something which his\nemotion made inarticulate, without venturing a glance towards Laura, he\nquitted the house, and returned home in a state bordering on\ndistraction.\n\nHe shut himself up in his chamber to consider of his situation, if that\ncan be called consideration, which was but a conflict of tumultuous\nfeeling. That Laura should have painted his portrait in a group where it\nheld such a relation to her own; that she should keep it concealed in an\napartment exclusively appropriated to herself; her alarm lest he should\nexamine it; her confusion, which had at last risen to the most\ndistressing height, from the idea of what De Courcy might infer, should\nhe discover that his own portrait was the cause of so many blushes; the\nconfiding affectionate matter in which she treated him,--all conspired\nto mislead De Courcy. He felt a conviction that he was beloved, and, in\nspite of himself, the thought was rapture.\n\nBut what availed this discovery? Could he forget the justice of his\nsister's claims, sacrifice to his selfish wishes the comfort of his\nmother, or wed his half-worshipped Laura to the distresses of an\nembarrassed fortune? 'Oh no,' he cried, 'let not my passions involve in\ndisaster all that I love.'\n\nOr could he lay open to Laura his feelings and his situation, and sue\nfor her love, even while their union must be delayed. Her attachment, he\nthought, was yet in its infancy, born of gratitude, fostered by\nseparation from other society, and, for the present, pleasing in its\nsensations, and transient in its nature. But he thought her capable of a\nlove as fervent--as deep-rooted as that which she inspired; and should\nhe wilfully awaken in her peaceful breast the cravings of such a passion\nas tortured his own; see her spirits, her vigour of mind, her\nusefulness, perhaps her health, give way to the sickness of 'hope\ndeferred!' No,--rather let her return to the indifference in which he\nfound her. Or, should he shackle her with a promise, of which honour\nmight extort a reluctant fulfilment, after the affection that prompted\nit was perhaps withdrawn from him? Or, should he linger on from day to\nday in vain endeavours to conceal his affection, dishonourably sporting\nwith the tenderness of the woman he loved, his ill-suppressed feelings\nevery hour offering a hope which must every hour be disappointed? No!\nthe generous heart of De Courcy would sooner have suffered a thousand\ndeaths.\n\nBut could he return--could he see again this creature, now more than\never dear to him, and stifle the fondness--the anguish that would rend\nhis bosom at parting? Impossible! He would see her no more. He would\ntear at once from his heart every hope--every joy--and dare at once all\nthe wretchedness that awaited him. In an agony of desperation, he rang\nfor his servant, ordered his horses, and in an hour was on his way to\nNorwood, with feelings which the criminal on the rack need not have\nenvied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nThe next morning, while Montreville and his daughter were expecting,\nwith some anxiety the arrival of their daily visitor, a note was brought\nwhich De Courcy had left in Audley Street, to be delivered after his\ndeparture. Though nearly illegible, from the agitation in which it was\nwritten, it contained nothing but the simple information, that he had\nbeen suddenly obliged to leave London. It assigned no reason for his\njourney--it fixed no period for his absence; and Montreville endeavoured\nto hope that his return would not be distant. But day after day passed\nheavily on, and De Courcy came not. Montreville again began to feel\nhimself a solitary deserted being; again became dejected; again became\nthe victim of real debility and fancied disease.\n\nAll Laura's endeavours failed to animate him to cheerfulness, or rouse\nhim to employment. If he permitted her to remain by him, he seemed\nrather to endure than to enjoy her presence, repressed with a languid\nmonosyllable her attempts at conversation, or passed whole hours in\nlistless silence. Laura, who forboded the worst consequences from the\nindulgence of this depression, endeavoured to persuade him that he might\nnow safely attempt a voyage to Scotland, and predicted beneficial\neffects from the sea air. But Montreville answered her with displeasure,\nthat such an exertion would certainly destroy him, and that those who\nwere themselves in high health and spirits, could not judge of the\nfeelings, nor sympathize with the weakness of disease. The reproach had\nno more justice than is usual with the upbraidings of the sickly; for\nLaura's spirits shared every turn of her father's, though her stronger\nmind could support with grace the burden that weighed him to the earth.\nShe desisted, however, from a subject which she saw that, for the\npresent, he would not bear, and confined her endeavours to persuading\nhim to undertake some light occupation, or to walk in the little garden\nthat belonged to the house. But, even in these attempts she was commonly\ndefeated; for Montreville would make no exertion, and the winter wind,\nnow keen and biting, pierced through his wasted form.\n\nNone but they who have made the melancholy experiment, can tell how\ncheerless is the labour of supporting the spirit that will make no\neffort to sustain itself, of soliciting the languid smile, offering the\nrejected amusement, or striving, with vain ingenuity, to enliven the\noft-repulsed conversation. They only know who have tried it, what it is\nto resist contagious depression--to struggle against the effects of the\ncomplaining voice, the languid motion, the hopeless aspect; what it is\nto suppress the sympathetic sigh, and restrain the little sally of\nimpatience, so natural to those whose labours are incessant, yet\nunavailing. Such were the tasks that Laura voluntarily prescribed to\nherself. Incited by affection, and by strong sense of duty, she soothed\nthe fretful humour, prompted the reluctant exertion, fanned the expiring\nhope, and seized the most favourable moment to soften by feminine\ntenderness, or exhilarate by youthful gaiety.\n\nMany motives may lead to one great effort of virtue. The hope of reward,\nthe desire of approbation, a sense of right, the natural benevolence\nwhich still affords a faint trait of the image in which man was made,\nall, or any of these, may produce single, or even oft-repeated acts\ndeserving of praise; but one principle alone can lead to virtuous\nexertions persevering and unremitting though without success. That\nprinciple was Laura's; and even while her endeavours seemed unavailing,\nshe was content to employ all her powers in the task selected for her by\nthe bestower of them.\n\nMontreville often reproached himself for the untimely burden which he\nwas laying on the young heart of his daughter; but he could make no\neffort to lighten it, and self-reproach served only to embitter the\nspirit which it failed of stimulating to exertion. Fretful and\nimpatient, yet conscious of his injustice, and unwilling that Laura\nshould observe it, he would often dismiss her from her attendance, and\nspend whole hours in solitary gloom. These hours Laura devoted to her\npicture, stealing between whiles, on tiptoe, to the door of her father's\napartment, to listen whether he was stirring; and sometimes venturing to\nknock gently for admittance.\n\nThe picture, which was far advanced when De Courcy left town, soon\nreceived the finishing touches; and Laura lost no time in transmitting\nit to Norwood. She wrote an affectionate letter to Harriet; in which,\nafter thanking her for all her kindness, she offered her gift, and\nadded, that to give her work a value which it would not otherwise have\npossessed, she had introduced the portrait of De Courcy; and that, glad\nof an opportunity of associating the remembrance of herself with an\nobject of interest, she had admitted her own resemblance into the group.\nShe apologized for the appearance of conceit which might attend her\nexhibiting her own form under the character of Virtue, by relating, with\ncharacteristic simplicity, that she had determined on her subject,\nchosen and half-finished her Hercules, before she designed the figures\nof his companions; that she had afterwards thought that her memorial\nwould be more effectual if it contained the portrait of the giver. 'And\nyou know,' added she, 'it would have been impossible to mould my solemn\ncountenance into the lineaments of Pleasure.'\n\nIn the singleness of her heart, it never occurred to Laura, that any\nthing in the mutual relation of the figures of her piece stood in need\nof explanation. Had Hargrave furnished the model for her hero, she would\nprobably have been a little more quick-sighted. As it was, she felt\nimpatient to shew the De Courcy family, not excepting Montague himself,\nthat she was not forgetful of their kindness; and she chose a day, when\nthe influence of bright sunshine a little revived the spirits of\nMontreville, to leave him for an hour, and accompany the picture to the\nshop of the obliging print-seller, that it might be packed more\nskilfully than by herself.\n\nAfter seeing it safely put up, she gave the address to Wilkins, who\nimmediately exclaimed, 'So, Ma'am, you have found out the secret that\nyou would not let me tell you?' 'What secret?' inquired Laura. 'The name\nof the gentleman, Ma'am, that bought your pictures.' 'Was it De Courcy,\nthen?' 'Yes, Ma'am;--though to be sure it might'n't be the same. But I\nsuppose you'll know him, Ma'am. A tall pleasant-looking gentleman,\nMa'am. The pictures were sent home to Audley Street.' Laura's\ncountenance brightened with satisfaction, and she suffered her informer\nto proceed. 'I am sure,' continued he, 'I managed that business to the\nvery best of my power, and, as one might say, very dexterously.' 'Was\nthere any occasion for management?' inquired Laura. 'Oh yes, Ma'am; for\nwhen he seemed very much taken with the first one, then I told him all\nabout you just as I had it all from Mrs Dawkins, and how you were so\nanxious to have it sold; and then he said he'd have it, and paid the\nmoney into my hands; and then I told him how you looked the first day\nyou brought it here, and that you were just ready to cry about it; and\nhe said he must have a companion to it.'\n\nThe flush, both of pride and vexation, for once stained the transparent\nskin of Laura. Yet it was but for a moment; and her next feeling was\npleasure at the confirmation of the benevolent character with which her\nimagination had invested De Courcy. He had purchased her work when she\nwas quite unknown to him, only, as she thought, from a wish to reward\nindustry; and because he had been led to believe that the price was an\nobject to the artist. Had another been the purchaser, she might have\nallowed something for the merit of the piece, but Laura was not yet\ncured of first imagining characters, and then bending facts to suit her\ntheory. Sooner than bate one iota from De Courcy's benevolence, she\nwould have assigned to her picture the rank of a sign-post.\n\nShe now remembered, that in her visits to Audley Street she had never\nseen her works; and in her approbation of the delicacy which prompted De\nCourcy to conceal that she was known to him as an artist, she forgot the\nlittle prejudice which this concealment implied. De Courcy, indeed, was\nhimself unconscious that he entertained any such prejudice. He applauded\nLaura's exertions; he approved of the spirit that led a young woman of\nfamily to dare, in spite of custom, to be useful. Yet he could not help\nacting as if she had shared the opinion of the world, and been herself\nashamed of her labours. But this was a shame that Laura knew not. She\nwished not indeed to intrude on the world's notice. Her choice was\npeaceful obscurity. But if she must be known, she would have far\npreferred the distinction earned by ingenious industry, to the notoriety\nwhich wealth and luxury can purchase.\n\nOn her return home, she found her father reading a letter which he had\njust received from De Courcy. It seemed written in an hour of\nmelancholy. The writer made no mention of returning to town; on the\ncontrary, he expressed a hope that Montreville might now be able to\nundertake a journey to Scotland. He besought the Captain to remember\nhim, to speak of him often, and to write to him sometimes; and ended\nwith these words--'Farewell, my friend; the dearest of my earthly hopes\nis, that we may one day meet again, though years, long years, must first\nintervene.'\n\n'So ends my last hope,' said Montreville, letting his head sink\nmournfully on his breast; 'De Courcy comes not, and thou must be left\nalone and unprotected.' 'The protection of so young a man,' said Laura,\navoiding to answer to a foreboding which she considered merely as a\nsymptom of her father's disease, 'might not perhaps have appeared\nadvantageous to me in the eyes of those who are unacquainted with Mr De\nCourcy.' 'It would have given comfort to my dying hour,' said\nMontreville, 'to consign thee to such a guardian--such a husband.' 'A\nhusband!' cried Laura, starting, and turning pale. 'Heaven be praised,\nthat Mr De Courcy never harboured such a thought!' Montreville looked up\nin extreme surprise; and inquired the reason of her thankfulness. 'Oh\nSir,' she replied, 'we owe so much to Mr De Courcy's friendship, that I\nshould have hated myself for being unable to return his affection;--and\npity would it have been that the love of so amiable a being should have\nbeen bestowed in vain.'\n\nMontreville fixed his eyes upon her, as if to seek for further\nexplanation, and continued to gaze on her face, when his thoughts had\nwandered from the examination of it. After some minutes of silence, he\nsaid--'Laura, you once rejected an alliance, splendid beyond my hopes,\nalmost beyond my wishes, and that with a man formed to be the darling of\nyour sex; and now you speak as if even Montague De Courcy would have\nfailed to gain you. Tell me, then, have you any secret attachment? Speak\ncandidly, Laura;--you will not always have a father to confide in.'\n\nDeep crimson dyed the cheeks of Laura; but, with the hesitation of a\nmoment, she replied--'No, Sir, I have no wish to marry. I pretend not to\nlay open my whole heart to you; but I may with truth assure you, that\nthere is not at this moment a man in being with whom I would unite\nmyself. I know you would not be gratified by extorted confidence.'\n\n'No, Laura,' said Montreville, 'I ask no more than you willingly avow. I\nconfide, as I have always done, in your prudence and integrity. Soon,\nalas! you will have no other guides. But it was my heart's wish to see\nyou united to a man who could value and protect your worth--of late,\nmore especially, when I feel that I so soon must leave you.'\n\n'My dearest father,' said Laura, throwing her arm affectionately round\nhis neck, 'do not give way to such gloomy forebodings. Your spirits are\noppressed by confinement--let us but see Glenalbert again, and all will\nbe well.'\n\n'I shall never see Glenalbert,' said Montreville;--'and left alone in\nsuch a place as this, without money, without friends, without a\nhome;--where shall my child find safety or shelter?'\n\n'Indeed, Sir,' said Laura, though a cold shuddering seized her, 'your\nfears have no foundation. Only yesterday Dr Flint told me that your\ncomplaints were without danger, and that a little exercise would make\nyou quite strong again.'\n\nMontreville shook his head. 'Dr Flint deceives you, Laura,' said\nhe;--'you deceive yourself.' 'No, indeed,' said Laura, though she\ntrembled; 'you look much better,--you are much better. It is only these\nmelancholy thoughts that retard your recovery. Trust yourself--trust me\nto the Providence that has hitherto watched over us.'\n\n'I could die without alarm,' said Montreville; 'but to leave thee alone\nand in want--Oh! I cannot bear it.' 'Should the worst befal,' said\nLaura, turning pale as alabaster, 'think that I shall not be alone, I\nshall not want, for'--her voice failed, but she raised her eyes with an\nexpression that filled up the ennobling sentiment. 'I believe it, my\nlove,' said Montreville, 'but you feel these consolations more strongly\nthan I do. Leave me for the present, I am fatigued, and wish to be\nalone.'\n\nLaura retired to her own room, and endeavoured herself to practise the\ntrust which she recommended to her father. Her meditations were\ninterrupted by the entrance of her landlady, Mrs Stubbs, who, with many\ncourtesies and apologies, said that she was come to present her account.\n\nLaura, who always had pleasure in cancelling a debt the moment it was\nincurred, and who conceived no apology to be necessary from those who\ncame to demand only their own, received her landlady very graciously,\nand begged her to be seated, while she went to bring her father's purse.\nMrs Stubbs spread her bills upon the table; and Laura, after examining\nthem, was obliged to ask an explanation.\n\n'Why, ma'am,' returned the landlady, 'there are fourteen guineas for\nlodgings for six weeks, and \u00c2\u00a310, 15s. for victuals and other articles\nthat I have furnished. I am sure I have kept an exact account.'\n\n'I understood,' said Laura, 'that we were to have the lodgings for a\nguinea and a half a-week, and'--'A guinea and a half!' cried the\nlandlady, colouring with wrath at this disparagement of her property.\n'Sure, Miss, you did not think to have lodgings such as these for a\nguinea and a half a-week. No, no--these lodgings have never been let for\nless than four guineas, and never shall, as long as my name is\nBridget.'\n\nLaura mildly pleaded her ignorance of those matters, and urged De\nCourcy's information as an excuse for her mistake. 'To be sure, Ma'am,'\nsaid the now pacified Mrs Stubbs, 'nobody that know'd any thing of the\nmatter, would expect to have such rooms for less than four guineas; and\nthat was what the gentleman said when he took them; so he paid me two\nguineas and a half advance for four weeks; and charged me not to let you\nknow of it; but I can't abide them secret doings; and, besides, if I\ntake only a guinea and a half from you, where was I to look for the rest\nof my rent for the last fortnight--for the young gentleman seems to have\ntaken himself off.'\n\nLaura suffered her loquacious hostess to proceed without interruption,\nfor her thoughts were fully occupied. She had incurred a debt greater,\nby five guineas, than she had been prepared to expect; and this sum was,\nin her present circumstances, of great importance. Yet her predominant\nfeeling was grateful approbation of De Courcy's benevolence; nor did her\nheart at all upbraid him with the consequences of his well-meant\ndeception. 'Kind, considerate De Courcy,' thought she; 'he had hoped\nthat, ere now, we should have ceased to need his generosity, and even\nhave been removed from the possibility of discovering it.'\n\nRecollecting herself, she paid the landlady her full demand; and,\ndismissing her, sat down to examine what remained of her finances. All\nthat she possessed, she found amounted to no more than one guinea and a\nfew shillings; and, dropping the money into her lap, she sat gazing on\nit in blank dismay.\n\nThe poverty, whose approach she had so long contemplated with a fearful\neye, had now suddenly overtaken her. Husbanded with whatever care, the\nsum before her could minister only to the wants of a few hours. In her\npresent habitation, it would scarcely purchase shelter for another night\nfrom the storm which a keen winter-wind was beginning to drive against\nher window. An immediate supply then was necessary; but where could that\nsupply be found? It was too late to resort to the earnings of her own\ngenius. Painting was a work of time and labour. No hasty production was\nlikely to find favour amidst the competition of studied excellence. Even\nthe highest effort of her art might long wait a purchaser; and tears\nfell from the eyes of Laura while she reflected that, even if she could\nagain produce a Leonidas, she might never again find a De Courcy.\n\nTo borrow money on the Captain's half-pay, was an expedient which Laura\nhad always rejected, as calculated to load their scanty income with a\nburden which it could neither shake off nor bear. But even to this\nexpedient she could now no longer have recourse; for Montreville had\nassured her that, in his present state of health, it would be impossible\nto mortgage his annuity for a single guinea.\n\nShe might raise a small supply by stripping her beloved Glenalbert of\nsome of its little luxuries and comforts; but, long before this\nrevolting business could be transacted, she must be absolutely\npennyless. Nor did she dare, without consulting her father, to give\norders for dismantling his home. And how should she inform him of the\nnecessity for such a sacrifice? Weakened both in body and in mind, how\nwould he endure the privations that attend on real penury? His naturally\nfeeble spirits already crushed to the earth, his kindly temper already,\nby anxiety and disappointment, turned to gall, his anxieties for his\nchild alarmed even to anguish, how could he bear to learn that real want\nhad reached him--had reached that dear child, whom the dread of leaving\nto poverty was poisoning the springs of life within him! 'He thinks he\nis about to leave me,' cried she, 'and shall I tell him that I must owe\nto charity even the sod that covers him from me? No; I will perish\nfirst,' and, starting from her seat, she paced the room in distressful\nmeditation on the means of concealing from her father the extent of\ntheir calamity.\n\nShe determined to take upon herself the care of their little fund, under\npretence that the trouble was too great for Montreville. He had of late\nshewn such listless indifference to all domestic concerns, that she\nhoped he might never inquire into the extent of his landlady's demand,\nor that his inquiries might be eluded. It seemed a light thing in\nLaura's eyes to suffer alone; or rather she thought not of her own\nsufferings, could she but spare her father the anguish of knowing\nhimself and his child utterly destitute. She judged of his feelings by\nher own; felt, by sympathy, all the pangs with which he would witness\nwants which he could not supply; and she inwardly vowed to conceal from\nhim every privation that she might endure,--every labour that she might\nundergo.\n\nBut, void of every resource, far from every friend, destitute amid\nboundless wealth, alone amid countless multitudes, whither should she\nturn for aid, or even for counsel? 'Whither,' cried she, dropping on her\nknees, 'except to Him who hath supplied me in yet more urgent want, who\nhath counselled me in yet more fearful difficulty, who hath fed my soul\nwith angel's food, and guided it with light from heaven?' Laura rose\nfrom her devotions, more confiding in the care of Providence, more able\nto consider calmly of improving the means which still remained within\nher own power.\n\nBefore she could finish and dispose of a picture, weeks must elapse for\nwhich she could make no provision. To painting, therefore, she could not\nhave immediate recourse. But sketches in chalk could be finished with\nexpedition; the printseller might undertake the sale of them; and the\nlowness of the price might invite purchasers. Could she but hope to\nobtain a subsistence for her father, she would labour night and day,\ndeprive herself of recreation, of rest, even of daily food, rather than\nwound his heart, by an acquaintance with poverty. 'And since his pride\nis hurt by the labours of his child,' said she, 'even his pride shall be\nsacred. He shall never know my labours.' And, so frail are even the\nbest, that an emotion of pride swelled the bosom of Laura at the thought\nthat the merit of her toils was enhanced by their secrecy.\n\nThe resolutions of Laura were ever the immediate prelude to action; and\nhere was no time for delay. She again looked mournfully upon her little\ntreasure, hopelessly re-examined the purse that contained it; again,\nwith dismay, remembered that it was her all; then, hastily putting it\ninto her pocket, she drew her portfolio towards her, and began to\nprepare for the work with the hurry of one to whom every moment seems\nprecious. Invention was at present impossible; but she tried to\nrecollect one of her former designs, and busied herself in sketching it\ntill the hour of dinner arrived. She then went to summon her father from\nhis chamber to the eating-room. 'This day,' thought she, 'I must share\nhis precarious sustenance--another I shall be more provident. And is\nthis then, perhaps, our last social meal?' and she turned for a moment\nfrom the door, to suppress the emotion that would have choked her\nutterance. 'Come in, my dear,' cried Montreville, who had heard her\nfootstep; and Laura entered with a smile. She offered her arm to assist\nhim in descending to the parlour. 'Why will you always urge me to go\ndown stairs, Laura,' said he; 'you see I am unequal to the fatigue.' 'I\nshall not urge you to-morrow,' answered Laura: and Montreville thought\nthe tears which stood in her eyes, were the consequence of the impatient\ntone in which he had spoken.\n\nDuring the evening, Laura avoided all mention of restoring the purse to\nher father, and he appeared to have forgotten its existence. But, by no\neffort could she beguile those cheerless hours. Her utmost exertions\nwere necessary to maintain the appearance of composure; and De Courcy's\nletter seemed to have consummated Montreville's feelings of solitude and\ndesolation. Wilfully, and without effort, he suffered his spirits to\nexpire. His whole train of thinking had become habitually gloomy. He was\nwretched, even without reference to his situation, and the original\ncause of his melancholy was rather the excuse than the reason of his\ndepression. But this only rendered more hopeless all attempts to cheer\nhim; for the woes of the imagination have this dire pre-eminence over\nthose which spring from real evils, that, while these can warm at times\nin benevolent joy, or even brighten for a moment to the flash of\ninnocent gaiety, the selfishness of the former, chequered by no kindly\nfeeling, reflects not the sunny smile; as the dark and noisome fog\ndrinks in vain the beam of Heaven.\n\nMontreville, when in health, had been always and justly considered a\nkind-hearted, good-natured man. He had been a most indulgent husband, an\neasy master, and a fond father. He was honourable, generous, and\nfriendly. Those who had witnessed his patient endurance of Lady\nHarriet's caprice had given his philosophy a credit which was better due\nto his indolence: for the grand defect of Montreville's character was a\ntotal want of fortitude and self-command; and of these failings he was\nnow paying the penalty. His health was injured by his voluntary\ninaction, his fancy aggravated his real disorder, and multiplied to\ninfinity his imaginary ailments. He had habituated his mind to images of\ndisaster, till it had become incapable of receiving any but comfortless\nand doleful impressions.\n\nAfter spending a few silent hours without effort towards employment or\nrecreation, he retired for the night; and Laura experienced a sensation\nof relief, as, shutting herself away into her apartment, she prepared to\nresume her labours. After every other member of the family had retired\nto rest, she continued to work till her candle expired in the socket;\nand then threw herself on her bed to rise again with the first blush of\ndawn.\n\nMontreville had been accustomed to breakfast in his own room; Laura\ntherefore found no difficulty in beginning her system of abstemiousness.\nHastily swallowing a few mouthfuls of dry bread, she continued her\ndrawing, till her father rang for his chocolate. She was fully resolved\nto adhere to this plan, to labour with unceasing industry, and to deny\nherself whatever was not essential to her existence.\n\nBut neither hard fare, nor labour, nor confinement, could occasion to\nLaura such pain as she suffered from another of the necessities of her\nsituation. Amidst her mournful reflections, it had occurred to her, that\nunless she would incur a debt which she could not hope to discharge, it\nwould be necessary to dismiss the surgeon who attended her father. All\nher ideas of honour and integrity revolted from suffering a man to\nexpend his time and trouble, in expectation of a return which she was\nunable to make. She was besides convinced that in Montreville's case\nmedicine could be of no avail. But she feared to hint the subject to her\nfather, lest she should lead to a discovery of their present\ncircumstances; and such was her conviction of the feebleness of his\nspirits, and such her dread of the consequences of their increased\ndepression, that all earthly evils seemed light compared with that of\nadding to his distress. Laura perhaps judged wrong; for one real evil\nsometimes ameliorates the condition, by putting to flight a host of\nimaginary calamities, and by compelling that exertion which makes any\nsituation tolerable. But she trembled for the effects of the slightest\nadditional suffering upon the life or the reason of her father; and she\nwould have thought it little less than parricide to add a new bruise to\nthe wounded spirit. On the other hand, she dreaded that Montreville, if\nkept in ignorance of its real cause, might consider the desertion of his\nmedical attendant as an intimation that his case was hopeless, and\nperhaps become the victim of his imaginary danger.\n\nShe knew not on what to resolve. Her distress and perplexity were\nextreme; and if any thing could have vanquished the stubborn integrity\nof Laura, the present temptation would have prevailed. But no wilful\nfraud could be the issue of her deliberations, who was steadily\nconvinced that inflexible justice looks on to blast with a curse even\nthe successful schemes of villany, and to shed a blessing on the sorrows\nof the upright. She would not even for her father incur a debt which she\ncould never hope to pay; and nothing remained but to consider of the\nbest means of executing her painful determination.\n\nHere a new difficulty occurred, for she could not decline the surgeon's\nfurther attendance without offering to discharge what she already owed.\nIn the present state of her funds, this was utterly impossible; for\nthough, at her instigation, his bill had been lately paid, she was sure\nthat the new one must already amount to more than all she possessed. How\nto procure the necessary supply she knew not; for even if she could have\nsecured the immediate sale of her drawings, the price of her daily and\nnightly toil would scarcely suffice to pay for the expensive habitation\nwhich she durst not propose to leave, and to bribe the fastidious\nappetite of Montreville with dainties of which he could neither bear the\nwant nor feel the enjoyment.\n\nOnce only, and it was but for a moment, she thought of appealing to the\nhumanity of Dr Flint, of unfolding to him her situation, and begging\nhis attendance upon the chance of future remuneration. But Laura was\ndestined once more to pay the penalty of her hasty judgments of\ncharacter. On Montreville's first illness, Dr Flint had informed Laura,\nwith (as she thought) great want of feeling, of her father's danger. He\nwas a gaunt, atrabilious, stern-looking man, with a rough voice, and\ncold repulsive manners. He had, moreover, an uninviting name; and though\nLaura was ashamed to confess to herself that such trifles could\ninfluence her judgment, these disadvantages were the real cause why she\nalways met Dr Flint with a sensation resembling that with which one\nencounters a cold, damp, north-east wind. To make any claim upon the\nbenevolence of a stranger--and such a stranger! It was not to be thought\nof. Yet Laura's opinion, or rather her feelings, wronged Dr Flint. His\nexterior, it is true, was far from prepossessing. It is also true, that,\nconsidering Montreville's first illness as the effect of a very\nunpardonable levity on the part of Laura, he had spoken to her on that\noccasion with even more than his usual frigidity. Nor did he either\npossess or lay claim to any great share of sensibility; but he was not\ndestitute of humanity; and had Laura explained to him her situation, he\nwould willingly have attended her father without prospect of recompense.\nBut Laura did not put his benevolence to the test. She suffered him to\nmake his morning visit and depart; while she was considering of a plan\nwhich appeared little less revolting.\n\nLaura knew that one of the most elegant houses in Grosvenor Street was\ninhabited by a Lady Pelham, the daughter of Lady Harriet Montreville's\nmother by a former marriage. She knew that, for many years, little\nintercourse had subsisted between the sisters; and that her father was\neven wholly unknown to Lady Pelham. But she was ignorant, that the\nimprudence of her mother's marriage served as the excuse for a coldness,\nwhich had really existed before it had any such pretext.\n\nWith all her Scotish prejudice in favour of the claims of kindred (and\nLaura in this and many other respects was entirely a Scotch woman), she\ncould not, without the utmost repugnance, think of applying to her\nrelation. To introduce herself to a stranger whom she had never seen--to\nappear not only as an inferior, but as a supplicant--a beggar! Laura had\nlong and successfully combated the innate pride of human nature; but her\nhumility almost failed under this trial. Her illustrious ancestry--the\ndignity of a gentlewoman--the independence of one who can bear to labour\nand endure to want, all rose successively to her mind; for pride can\nwear many specious forms. But she had nearer claims than the honour of\nher ancestry--dearer concerns than her personal importance; and when she\nthought of her father, she felt that she was no longer independent.\n\nSevere was her struggle, and bitter were the tears which she shed over\nthe conviction that it was right that she should become a petitioner for\nthe bounty of a stranger. In vain did she repeat to herself, that she\nwas a debtor to the care of Providence for her daily bread, and was not\nentitled to choose the means by which it was supplied. She could not\nconquer her reluctance. But she could act right in defiance of it. She\ncould sacrifice her own feelings to the comfort of her father--to a\nsense of duty. Nay, upon reflection, she could rejoice that\ncircumstances compelled her to quell that proud spirit with which, as a\nChristian, she maintained a constant and vigorous combat.\n\nWhile these thoughts were passing in her mind, she had finished her\ndrawing; and, impatient to know how far this sort of labour was likely\nto be profitable, she furnished her father with a book to amuse him in\nher absence; and, for the first time since they had occupied their\npresent lodgings, expressed a wish to take a walk for amusement. Had\nMontreville observed the blushes that accompanied this little\nsubterfuge, he would certainly have suspected that the amusement which\nthis walk promised was of no common kind; but he was in one of his\nreveries, hanging over the mantle-piece, with his forehead resting on\nhis arm, and did not even look up while he desired her not to be long\nabsent.\n\nShe resolved to go first to Lady Pelham, that coming early she might\nfind her disengaged, and afterwards to proceed to the print-shop.\n\nThe wind blew keen across the snow as Laura began her reluctant\npilgrimage. Her summer attire, to which her finances could afford no\naddition, ill defended her from the blast. Through the streets of London\nshe was to explore her way unattended. Accustomed to find both beauty\nand pleasure in the solitude of her walks, she was to mix in the throngs\nof a rude rabble, without protection from insult. But no outward\ncircumstances could add to the feelings of comfortless dismay with which\nshe looked forward to the moment, when, ushered through stately\napartments into the presence of self-important greatness, she should\nannounce herself a beggar. Her courage failed--she paused, and made one\nstep back towards her home. But she recalled her former thoughts. 'I\nhave need to be humbled,' said she; and again proceeded on her way.\n\nAs she left the little garden that surrounded her lodgings, she\nperceived an old man who had taken shelter by one of the pillars of the\ngate. He shivered in the cold, which found easy entrance through the\nrags that covered him, and famine glared from his hollow eye. His gray\nhair streamed on the wind, as he held out the tattered remains of a hat,\nand said, 'Please to help me, Lady.--I am very poor.' He spoke in the\ndialect of her native land, and the accents went to Laura's heart;--for\nLaura was in the land of strangers. She had never been deaf to the\npetitions of the poor; for all the poor of Glenalbert were known to her;\nand she knew that what she spared from her own comforts, was not made\nthe minister of vice. Her purse was already in her hand, ere she\nremembered that to give was become a crime.\n\nAs the thought crossed her, she started like one who had escaped from\nsudden danger. 'No, I must not give you money,' said she, and returned\nthe purse into her pocket, with a pang that taught her the true\nbitterness of poverty. 'I am cold and hungry,' said the man still\npleading, and taking encouragement from Laura's relenting eye. 'Hungry!'\nrepeated Laura, 'then come with me, and I will give you bread;' and she\nreturned to the house to bestow on the old man the humble fare which she\nhad before destined to supply her own wants for the day, glad to\npurchase by a longer fast the right to feed the hungry.\n\n'In what respect am I better than this poor creature,' said she to\nherself, as she returned with the beggar to the gate, 'that I should\noffer to him with ease, and even with pleasure, what I myself cannot ask\nwithout pain. Surely I do not rightly believe that we are of the same\ndust! The same frail, sinful, perishable, dust!'\n\nBut it was in vain that Laura continued to argue with herself. In this\ninstance she could only do her duty; she could not love it. Her heart\nfilled, and the tears rose to her eyes. She dashed them away--but they\nrose again.\n\nWhen she found herself in Grosvenor Street, she paused for a moment.\n'What if Lady Pelham should deny my request? dismiss me as a bold\nintruder? Why, then,' said Laura, raising her head, and again advancing\nwith a firmer step, 'I shall owe no obligation to a stranger.'\n\nShe approached the house--she ascended the steps. Almost breathless she\nlaid her hand upon the knocker. At that moment she imagined her entrance\nthrough files of insolent domestics into a room filled with gay company.\nShe anticipated the inquisitive glances--shrunk in fancy from the\nsupercilious examination; and she again drew back her hand. 'I shall\nnever have courage to face all this,' thought she. While we hesitate, a\ntrifle turns the scale. Laura perceived that she had drawn the attention\nof a young man on the pavement, who stood gazing on her with familiar\ncuriosity; and she knocked, almost before she was sensible that she\nintended it.\n\nThe time appeared immeasurable till the door was opened by a\nmaid-servant. 'Is Lady Pelham at home?' inquired Laura, taking\nencouragement from the sight of one of her own sex. 'No, Ma'am,'\nanswered the maid, 'my lady is gone to keep Christmas in ----shire, and\nwill not return for a fortnight.' Laura drew a long breath, as if a\nweight had been lifted from her breast; and, suppressing an ejaculation\nof 'thank Heaven,' sprung in the lightness of her heart at one skip from\nthe door to the pavement.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nLaura's exultation was of short continuance. She had gone but a few\nsteps ere she reflected that the wants which she had undertaken so\npainful a visit to supply were as clamant as ever, and now further than\never from a chance of relief. Mournfully she pursued her way towards the\nprint-shop, hopelessly comparing her urgent and probably prolonged\nnecessities with her confined resources.\n\nThe utmost price which she could hope to receive for the drawing she\ncarried, would be far from sufficient to discharge her debt to the\nsurgeon; and there seemed now no alternative but to confess her\ninability to pay, and to throw herself upon his mercy. To this measure,\nhowever, she was too averse to adopt it without reconsidering every\nother possible expedient. She thought of appealing to the friendship of\nMrs Douglas, and of suffering Dr Flint to continue his visits till an\nanswer from her friend should enable her to close the connection. But\nMrs Douglas's scanty income was taxed to the uttermost by the\nmaintenance and education of a numerous family, by the liberal charities\nof its owners, and by the hospitable spirit, which, banished by\nostentation from more splendid abodes, still lingers by the fireside of\na Scotch clergyman. Laura was sure that Mrs Douglas would supply her\nwants at whatever inconvenience to herself; and this very consideration\nwithheld her from making application to her friend.\n\nLaura had heard and read that ladies in distress had found subsistence\nby the sale of their ornaments. But by their example she could not\nprofit; for her ornaments were few in number and of no value. She wore\nindeed a locket, which she had once received from her mother, with a\nstrong injunction neither to lose nor give it away; but Laura, in her\nprofound ignorance of the value of trinkets, attached no estimation to\nthis one, except as the only unnecessary gift which she had ever\nreceived from her mother. 'It contains almost as much gold as a guinea,'\nsaid she, putting her hand to it, 'and a guinea will soon be a great\ntreasure to me.' Still she determined that nothing short of extremity\nshould induce her to part with it; but desirous to ascertain the extent\nof this last resort, she entered the shop of a jeweller, and presenting\nthe locket, begged to know its value.\n\nAfter examining it, the jeweller replied that he believed it might be\nworth about five guineas, 'for though,' said he, 'the setting is\nantiquated, these emeralds are worth something.'\n\nAt the mention of this sum, all Laura's difficulties seemed to vanish.\nBesides enabling her to pay the surgeon, it would make an addition to\nher little fund. With rigorous abstinence on her part, this little fund,\ntogether with the price of her incessant labour, would pay for her\nlodgings, and support her father in happy ignorance of his poverty, till\nhe was able to remove to Glenalbert. Then, when he was quite well and\nquite able to bear it, she would tell him how she had toiled for him,\nand he would see that he had not lavished his fondness on a thankless\nchild.\n\nThese thoughts occupied far less time than the recital; and yet, ere\nthey were passed, Laura had untied the locket from her neck, and put it\ninto the hands of the jeweller. It was not till she saw it in the hands\nof another, that she felt all the pain of parting with it. She asked to\nsee it once more; as she gazed on it for the last time, tears trickled\nfrom her eyes; but speedily wiping them away, and averting her head, she\nrestored the locket to its new owner, and taking up the money, departed.\n\nShe soon arrived at the print-shop, and finding Wilkins disengaged,\nproduced her drawing, and asked him to purchase it. Wilkins looked at\nit, and inquired what price she had put upon it. 'I am quite\nunacquainted with its real value,' answered she, 'but the rapid sale of\nmy work is at present such an object to me, that I shall willingly make\nit as cheap as possible, or allow you to fix your own price.' 'Have you\nany more to dispose of, Ma'am?' asked Wilkins. 'I have none finished,\nbut I could promise you six more in a week if you are inclined to take\nthem.' 'I think,' said Wilkins, 'after some consideration, I might\nventure to take them if you could afford them for half a guinea each.'\n'You shall have them,' said Laura, with a sigh; 'but I think\nhalf-a-guinea rather a low--a high, I believe, I mean.--'\n\nLaura did not at this moment exactly know what she meant; for her eyes\nhad just rested on a gentleman, who, with his back towards her, was\nbusied in examining a book of caricatures. She thought she could not be\nmistaken in the person. Only one form upon earth was endowed with such\nsymmetry and grace; and that form was Hargrave's. He slightly turned his\nhead, and Laura was certain.\n\nThough Laura neither screamed nor fainted, this recognition was not made\nwithout extreme emotion. She trembled violently, and a mist spread\nbefore her eyes; but she remembered the apparently wilful desertion of\nher lover; and, determined neither to claim his compassion nor gratify\nhis vanity by any of the airs of a forsaken damsel, she quietly turned\naway from him, and leant against the counter to recover strength and\ncomposure.\n\nShe was resolved to quit the shop the instant that she was able; and\nyet, perhaps she would have become sooner sensible of her recovered\npowers of motion, had it not been for a latent hope that the caricatures\nwould not long continue so very interesting. No one however, accosted\nher; and next came the idea that Hargrave had already observed her,\nwithout wishing to claim her acquaintance. Before the mortifying thought\ncould take a distinct form, Laura was already on her way towards the\ndoor.\n\n'You have left your half-guinea, Ma'am,' said Wilkins, calling after\nher; and Laura, half angry at being detained, turned back to fetch it.\nAt this moment Hargrave's eye fell upon her half averted face. Surprise\nand joy illuminating his fine countenance, 'Laura!' he exclaimed, 'is it\npossible! have I at last found you?' and springing forward, he clasped\nher to his breast, regardless of the inquisitive looks and significant\nsmiles of the spectators of his transports. But to the scrutiny of\nstrangers, to the caresses of Hargrave, even to the indecorum of her\nsituation, poor Laura was insensible. Weakened by the fatigue and\nemotion of the two preceding days, overcome by the sudden conviction\nthat she had not been wilfully neglected, her head sunk upon the\nshoulder of Hargrave, and she lost all consciousness.\n\nWhen Laura recovered, she found herself in a little parlour adjoining to\nthe shop, with no attendant but Hargrave, who still supported her in his\narms. Her first thought was vexation at her own ill-timed sensibility;\nher next, a resolution to make no further forfeiture of her\nrespectability, but rather, by the most stoical composure, to regain\nwhat she had lost. For this purpose, she soon disengaged herself from\nher perilous support, and unwilling to speak till secure of maintaining\nher firmness, she averted her head, and returned all Hargrave's\nraptures of love and joy with provoking silence.\n\nAs soon as she had completely recovered her self-possession, she rose,\nand apologizing for the trouble she had occasioned him, said she would\nreturn home. Hargrave eagerly begged permission to accompany her, saying\nthat his carriage was in waiting, and would convey them. Laura, with\ncold politeness, declined his offer. Though a little piqued by her\nmanner, Hargrave triumphed in the idea that he retained all his former\ninfluence. 'My bewitching Laura,' said he, taking her hand, 'I beseech\nyou to lay aside this ill-timed coquetry. After so sweet, so interesting\na proof, that you still allow me some power over your feelings, must I\naccuse you of an affectation of coldness?' 'No, sir,' said Laura\nindignantly, 'rather of a momentary weakness, for which I despise\nmyself.'\n\nThe lover could not indeed have chosen a more unfavourable moment to\nexpress his exultation; for Laura's feelings of humiliation and\nself-reproach were just then raised to their height, by her perceiving\nthe faces of two of the shop-boys peeping through the glass door with an\naspect of roguish curiosity. Conscious of her inability to walk home,\nand feeling her situation quite intolerable, she called to one of the\nlittle spies, and begged that he would instantly procure her a hackney\ncoach.\n\nHargrave vehemently remonstrated against this disorder. 'Why this unkind\nhaste?' said he. 'Surely after so tedious, so tormenting an absence, you\nneed not grudge me a few short moments.' Laura thought he was probably\nhimself to blame for the absence of which he complained, and coldly\nanswering, 'I have already been detained too long,' was about to quit\nthe room, when Hargrave, impatiently seizing her hand, exclaimed,\n'Unfeeling Laura! does that relentless pride never slumber? Have I\nfollowed you from Scotland, and sought you for three anxious months, to\nbe met without one kind word, one pitying look!'\n\n'Followed me!' repeated Laura with surprise.\n\n'Yes, upon my life, my journey hither had no other object. After you so\ncruelly left me, without warning or farewell, how could I endure to\nexist in the place which you once made delightful to me. Indeed I could\nnot bear it. I resolved to pursue you wherever you went, to breathe at\nleast the same air with you, sometimes to feast my fond eyes with that\nform, beyond imagination lovely--perhaps to win that beguiling smile\nwhich no heart can withstand. The barbarous caution of Mrs Douglas in\nrefusing me your address, has caused the disappointment of all my\nhopes.'\n\nHargrave had egregiously mistaken the road to Laura's favour when he\nthrew a reflection upon her friend. 'Mrs Douglas certainly acted right,'\nsaid she. 'I have equal confidence in her prudence and in her\nfriendship.' 'Probably then,' said Hargrave, reddening with vexation,\n'this system of torture originated with you. It was at your desire that\nyour friend withstood all my entreaties.' 'No,' answered Laura, 'I\ncannot claim the merit of so much forethought. I certainly did not\nexpect the honour that you are pleased to say you have done me,\nespecially when you were doubtful both of my abode and of your own\nreception.'\n\n'Insulting girl,' cried Hargrave, 'you know too well, that, however\nreceived, still I must follow you. And, but for a series of the most\ntormenting accidents, I should have defeated the caution of your\ncold-hearted favourite. At the Perth post-office I discovered that your\nletters were addressed to the care of Mr Baynard; and the very hour that\nI reached London, I flew to make inquiries after you. I found that Mr\nBaynard's house was shut up, and that he was gone in bad health to\nRichmond. I followed him, and was told that he was too ill to be spoken\nwith, that none of the servants knew your abode, as the footman who used\nto carry messages to you had been dismissed, and that your letters were\nnow left at Mr Baynard's chambers in town. Thither I went, and learnt\nthat, ever since your removal to Richmond, you had yourself sent for\nyour letters, and that, of course, the clerks were entirely ignorant of\nyour residence. Imagine my disappointment. The people, however, promised\nto make inquiries of your messenger, and to let me know where you might\nbe found; and day after day did I haunt them, the sport of vain hope and\nbitter disappointment. No other letter ever came for you, nor did you\never inquire for any.'\n\n'After Mr Baynard's removal to Richmond,' said Laura, 'I directed Mrs\nDouglas to address her letters to our lodgings.'\n\n'Ah Laura, think what anxieties, what wretchedness I have suffered in my\nfruitless search! Yet you meet me only to drive me coldly from your\npresence. Once you said that you pardoned the folly--the madness that\noffended you; but too well I see that you deceived yourself or me--that\nno attachment, no devotion can purchase your forgiveness.' 'Indeed,'\nsaid Laura, melted by the proof which she had received of her lover's\naffection, yet fearful of forfeiting her caution, 'I am incapable of\nharbouring enmity against the worst of human beings, and--'\n\n'Enmity!' interrupted Hargrave, 'Heavens, what a word!' 'I mean,' said\nLaura, faltering, 'that I am not insensible to the regard--'\n\n'Madam, the coach is at the door,' said the shop-boy, again peeping\nslily into the room; and Laura, hastily bidding Hargrave good morning,\nwalked towards the carriage. Having herself given the coachman his\ndirections, she suffered Hargrave to hand her in, giving him a slight\nbow in token of dismissal. He continued, however, to stand for some\nmoments with his foot upon the step, waiting for a look of permission to\naccompany her; but, receiving none, he sprung into the seat by her side,\nand called to the man to drive on. Laura offended at his boldness, gave\nhim a very ungracious look, and drew back in silence, 'I see you think\nme presumptuous,' said he, 'but, just found, how can I consent to leave\nyou? Oh Laura, if you knew what I have suffered from an absence that\nseemed endless! Not for worlds would I endure such another.'\n\n'The stipulated two years are still far from a close,' said Laura\ncoldly; 'and, till they are ended, our intercourse cannot be too\nslight.'\n\n'Surely,' cried Hargrave, 'when you fixed this lingering probation, you\ndid not mean to banish me from your presence for two years!' Laura could\nnot with truth aver that such a banishment had been her intention. 'I\nbelieve,' said she, suppressing a sigh, 'that would have been my wisest\nmeaning.' 'I would sooner die,' cried Hargrave, vehemently. 'Oh, had I\nsooner found you,' added he, a dark expression which Laura could not\ndefine clouding his countenance, 'what wretchedness would have been\nspared! But now that we have at last met,' continued he, his eyes again\nsparkling with love and hope, 'I will haunt you, cling to you,\nsupplicate you, till I melt you to a passion as fervent as my own,'\nWhile he spoke he dropped upon his knee by her side, and drew his arm\npassionately round her. Time had been, that Laura, trembling with\nirrepressible emotion, would have withdrawn from the embrace,\nreproaching herself for sensations from which she imagined that the more\nspotless heart of her lover was free, and hating herself for being\nunable to receive as a sister, the caresses of a fondness pure as a\nbrother's love. But Hargrave had himself torn the veil from her eyes;\nand shrinking from him as if a serpent had crossed her path, she cast on\nhim a look that struck like an ice-bolt on the glowing heart of\nHargrave. 'Just Heaven!' he cried, starting up with a convulsive\nshudder, 'this is abhorrence! Why, why have you deceived me with a\nfalse show of sensibility? Speak it at once,' said he, wildly grasping\nher arm; 'say that you detest me, and tell me too who has dared to\nsupplant me in a heart once wholly mine.'\n\n'Be calm, I implore you,' said Laura, terrified at his violence, 'no one\nhas supplanted you. I am, I ever shall be, whatever you deserve to find\nme.'\n\nLaura's soothing voice, her insinuating look, retained all their wonted\npower to calm the fierce passions of her lover. 'Oh I shall never\ndeserve you,' said he in a tone of wretchedness, while his face was\nagain crossed by an expression of anguish, which the unsuspecting Laura\nattributed to remorse for his former treatment of herself.\n\nThe carriage at this moment stopped, and anxious to calm his spirits at\nparting, Laura smiled kindly upon him, and said, 'Be ever thus humble in\nyour opinion of your own merits, ever thus partial in your estimate of\nmine, and then,' added she, the tears trembling in her lovely eyes, 'we\nshall meet again in happier circumstances.' 'You must not, shall not\nleave me thus,' cried Hargrave impatiently, 'I will not quit this spot,\ntill you have consented to see me again.' 'Do not ask it,' replied\nLaura. 'A long, long time must elapse, much virtuous exertion must be\nundergone, ere I dare receive you with other than this coldness, which\nappears to be so painful to you. Why then sport with your own feelings\nand with mine?' 'Ah Laura,' said Hargrave in a voice of supplication,\n'use me as you will, only suffer me to see you.' Moved with the\nimploring tone of her lover, Laura turned towards him that she might\nsoften by her manner the meditated refusal; but, in an evil hour for her\nresolution, she met the fine eyes of Hargrave suffused with tears, and,\nwholly unable to utter what she intended, she remained silent. Hargrave\nwas instantly sensible of his advantage, and willing to assist her\nacquiescence by putting his request into a less exceptionable form, he\nsaid, 'I ask not even for your notice, suffer me but to visit your\nfather.' 'My father has been very ill,' returned Laura, who, unknown to\nherself, rejoiced to find an excuse for her concession, 'and it may give\n_him_ pleasure to see you; but I can claim no share in the honour of\nyour visits.' Hargrave, delighted with his success, rapturously thanked\nher for her condescension; and springing from the carriage, led her, but\nhalf satisfied with her own conduct, into the house.\n\nShe ushered him into the parlour, and before he had time to detain her,\nglided away to acquaint her father with his visit. She found the Captain\nwrapt in the same listless melancholy in which she had left him; the\nbook which she had meant to entertain him, used only as a rest for his\narm. Laura was now beset with her old difficulty. She had not yet learnt\nto speak of Hargrave without sensible confusion; and to utter his name\nwhile any eye was fixed upon her face, required an effort which no\ncommon circumstances could have tempted her to make. She therefore took\nrefuge behind her father's chair, before she began her partial relation\nof her morning's adventure.\n\n'And is he now in the house,' cried Montreville, with an animation which\nhe had long laid aside. 'I rejoice to hear it. Return to him\nimmediately, my love. I will see him in a few minutes.' 'As soon as you\nchoose to receive him,' said Laura; 'I shall carry your commands. I\nshall remain in the dressing-room.' 'For shame, Laura!' returned\nMontreville. 'I thought you had been above these silly airs of conquest.\nColonel Hargrave's rejected passion gives you no right to refuse him the\npoliteness due to all your father's guests.' 'Certainly not, Sir,\nbut'--she stopped, hesitating--'however,' added she, 'since _you_ wish\nit, I will go.'\n\nIt was not without embarrassment that Laura returned to her lover; to\noffer him another t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate seemed so like soliciting a renewal of his\nardours. In this idea she was stopping at the parlour door, collecting\nher courage, and meditating a speech decorously repulsive, when\nHargrave, who had been listening for her approach, impatiently stepped\nout to look for her, and in a moment spoiled all her concerted oratory,\nby taking her hand and leading her into the room.\n\nThough Hargrave could at any time take Laura's feelings by surprise, an\ninstant was sufficient to restore her self-possession; and withdrawing\nher hand, she said, 'In a few minutes, Sir, my father will be glad to\nsee you, and at his desire I attend you till he can have that honour.'\n'Bless him for the delay!' cried Hargrave, 'I have a thousand things to\nsay to you.' 'And I, Sir,' said Laura, solemnly, 'have one thing to say\nto you, of more importance to me, probably, than all the thousand.'\n\nHargrave bit his lip; and Laura proceeded, her colour, as painful\nrecollection rose, fading from the crimson that had newly flushed it, to\nthe paleness of anguish. 'Six months ago,' said she, speaking with an\neffort that rendered her words scarcely articulate--'Six months ago you\nmade me a promise. Judge of my anxiety that you should keep it, when to\nsecure its fulfilment I can call up a subject so revolting--so\ndreadful.' She paused--a cold shudder running through her limbs: but\nHargrave, abashed and disconcerted, gave her no interruption, and\nventured not even to raise his eyes from the ground. 'My father,' she\ncontinued, 'is no longer able to avenge his child;--the bare mention of\nher wrongs would destroy him. If then you value my peace--if you dread\nmy detestation--let no circumstance seduce, no accident surprise from\nyou this hateful secret.'\n\nWhile she spoke, the blushes which had deserted her cheek were\ntransferred to that of Hargrave; for though, to his own conscience, he\nhad palliated his former outrage till it appeared a very venial\ntrespass, he was not proof against the unaffected horror with which it\nhad inspired the virtuous Laura. Throwing himself at her feet, and\nhiding his face in her gown, he bitterly, and for the moment sincerely,\nbewailed his offence, and vowed to devote his life to its expiation.\nThen, starting up, he struck his hand wildly upon his forehead, and\nexclaimed, 'Madman that I have been! Oh, Laura, thy heavenly purity\nmakes me the veriest wretch. No--thou canst never pardon me!'\n\nThe innocent Laura, who little suspected all his causes of\nself-reproach, wept tears of joy over his repentance, and, in a voice\nfull of tenderness, said, 'Indeed I have myself too many faults to be\nunrelenting. Contrition and amendment are all that Heaven requires--why\nshould I ask more?' Hargrave saw that she attributed all his agitation\nto remorse for his conduct towards herself; but the effects of her\nmistake were too delightful to suffer him to undeceive her; and\nperceiving at once that he had found the master-spring of all her\ntenderness, he overpowered her with such vows, protestations, and\nentreaties, that, before their conference was interrupted, he had,\namidst tremors, blushes, and hesitation, which spoke a thousand times\nmore than her words, wrung from her a confession that she felt a more\nthan friendly interest in the issue of his probation.\n\nIndeed Montreville was in no haste to break in upon their dialogue. That\nany woman should have refused the hand of the handsome--the\ninsinuating--the gallant Colonel Hargrave, had always appeared to him\nlittle less than miraculous. He had been told, that ladies sometimes\nrejected what they did not mean to relinquish; and though he could\nscarcely believe his daughter capable of such childish coquetry, he was\nnot without faith in a maxim, which, it must be confessed, receives\nsanction from experience, namely, that in all cases of feminine\nobduracy, perseverance is an infallible recip\u00c3\u00a9. This recip\u00c3\u00a9, he had no\ndoubt, was now to be tried upon Laura; and he fervently wished that it\nmight be with success. Though he was too affectionate a father to form\non this subject a wish at variance with his daughter's happiness, he had\nnever been insensible to the desire of seeing her brow graced by a\ncoronet. But now more important considerations made him truly anxious to\nconsign her to the guardianship of a man of honour.\n\nThe unfortunate transaction of the annuity would, in the event of his\ndeath, leave her utterly destitute. That event, he imagined, was fast\napproaching; and with many a bitter pang he remembered that he had\nneither friend nor relative with whom he could entrust his orphan child.\nHis parents had long been dead; his only surviving brother, a\nfox-hunting squire of small fortune, shared his table and bed with a\nperson who had stooped to these degrading honours from the more\nreputable situation of an innocent dairy-maid. With Lady Harriet's\nrelations (for friends she had none), Montreville had never maintained\nany intercourse. They had affected to resent his intrusion into the\nfamily, and he had not been industrious to conciliate their favour.\nExcept himself, therefore, Laura had no natural protector; and this\ncircumstance made him tenfold more anxious that she should recal her\ndecision in regard to Hargrave.\n\nHe had no doubt that the present visit was intended for Laura; and he\nsuffered as long a time to elapse before he claimed any share in it, as\ncommon politeness would allow. He had meant to receive the Colonel in\nhis own apartment, but an inclination to observe the conduct of the\nlovers, induced him to make an effort to join them in the parlour, where\nhe with pleasure discovered by the countenances of both, that their\nconversation had been mutually interesting. Hargrave instantly recovered\nhimself, and paid his compliments with his accustomed grace; but Laura,\nby no means prepared to stand inspection, disappeared the moment her\nfather entered the room.\n\nThis was the first time that the gentlemen had met, since the day when\nMontreville had granted his fruitless sanction to the Colonel's suit.\nDelicacy prevented the father from touching upon the subject, and it was\nequally avoided by Hargrave, who had not yet determined in what light to\nrepresent his repulse. However, as it completely occupied the minds of\nboth, the conversation, which turned on topics merely indifferent, was\ncarried on with little spirit on either side, and was soon closed by\nHargrave's taking leave, after begging permission to repeat his visit.\n\nColonel Hargrave had promised to spend that evening with the most\nbeautiful woman in London; but the unexpected rencounter of the\nmorning, left him in no humour to fulfil his engagement. He had found\nhis Laura,--his lovely, his innocent Laura,--the object of his only\nserious passion,--the only woman whose empire reached beyond his senses.\nHe had found her cautious, reserved, severe; yet feeling, constant, and\ntender. He remembered the overwhelming joy which made her sink fainting\non his bosom; called to mind her ill-suppressed tears--her smothered\nsighs--her unbidden blushes; and a thousand times assured himself that\nhe was passionately beloved. He triumphed the more in the proofs of her\naffection, because they were not only involuntary but reluctant; and,\nseen through the flattering medium of gratified pride, her charms\nappeared more than ever enchanting. On these charms he had formerly\nsuffered his imagination to dwell, till to appropriate them seemed to\nhim almost the chief end of existence; and, though in absence his frenzy\nhad a little intermitted, his interview with Laura roused it again to\ndouble violence.\n\nNo passion of Hargrave's soul (and all his passions were of intense\nforce), had ever known restraint, or control, or even delay of\ngratification, excepting only this, the strongest that had ever governed\nhim. And must he now pine for eighteen lingering months, ere he attained\nthe object of such ardent wishes? Must he submit, for a time that seemed\nendless, to the tyranny of this intolerable passion,--see the woman on\nwhom he doated receive his protestations with distrust, and spite of her\naffection, shrink from his caresses with horror? No!--he vowed that if\nthere were persuasion in man, or frailty in woman, he would shorten the\nperiod of his trial,--that he would employ for this purpose all the\npower which he possessed over Laura's heart, and, if that failed, that\nhe would even have recourse to the authority of the father.\n\nBut he had yet a stronger motive than the impetuosity of his passions\nfor striving to obtain immediate possession of his treasure. He was\nconscious that there was a tale to tell, which, once known, (and it\ncould not long be concealed), would shake his hopes to the foundation.\nBut on this subject he could not now dwell without disgust, and he\nturned from it to the more inviting contemplation of Laura's beauty and\nLaura's love; and with his head and his heart, every nerve, every pulse\nfull of Laura, he retired to pursue in his dreams, the fair visions that\nhad occupied his waking thoughts.\n\nWhile he was thus wilfully surrendering himself to the dominion of his\nfrenzy, Laura, the self-denied Laura, was endeavouring, though it must\nbe owned without distinguished success, to silence the pleadings of a\nheart as warm, though better regulated, by attending to the humble\nduties of the hour.\n\nWhen she quitted Hargrave, she had retired to offer up her fervent\nthanks to Heaven, that he was become sensible of the enormity of his\nformer conduct. Earnestly did she pray, that, though earth should never\nwitness their union, they might be permitted together to join a nobler\nsociety--animated by yet purer love--bound by yet holier ties. She next\nreconsidered her own behaviour towards Hargrave; and, though vexed at\nthe momentary desertion of her self-command, saw, upon the whole, little\ncause to reproach herself, since her weakness had been merely that of\nbody, to which the will gave no consent. She resolved to be guardedly\ncautious in her future demeanour towards him; and since the issue of his\nprobation was doubtful, since its close was at all events distant, to\nforfeit the enjoyment of her lover's company, rather than, by remaining\nin the room during his visits, appear to consider them as meant for\nherself.\n\nAs soon as Hargrave was gone, Montreville returned to his chamber; and\nthere Laura ordered his small but delicate repast to be served, excusing\nherself from partaking of it, by saying that she could dine more\nconveniently in the parlour. Having in the morning bestowed on the\nbeggar the meagre fare that should have supplied her own wants, she\nemployed the time of her father's meal, in the labour which was to\npurchase him another; pondering meanwhile on the probability that he\nwould again enter on the discussion of Hargrave's pretensions. To this\nsubject she felt unconquerable repugnance; and though she knew that it\nmust at last be canvassed, and that she must at last assign a reason for\nher conduct, she would fain have put off the evil hour.\n\nShe delayed her evening visit to her father, till he grew impatient for\nit, and sent for her to his apartment. The moment she entered the room,\nhe began, as she had anticipated, to inquire into the particulars of her\ninterview with Hargrave. The language of Laura's reply was not very\nperspicuous; the manner of it was more intelligible: and Montreville,\ninstantly comprehended the nature of her conference with the Colonel.\n'He has then given you an opportunity of repairing your former\nrashness,' said Montreville, with eagerness,--'and your answer?'\n'Colonel Hargrave had his answer long ago, Sir', replied Laura,\ntrembling at this exordium. Montreville sighed heavily, and, fixing his\neyes mournfully upon her, remained silent. At last, affectionately\ntaking her hand, he said, 'My dear child, the time has been, when even\nyour caprices on this subject were sacred with your father. While I had\na shelter, however humble--an independence, however small, to offer you,\nyour bare inclination determined mine. But now your situation is\nchanged--fatally changed; and no trivial reasons would excuse me for\npermitting your rejection of an alliance so unexceptionable, so\nsplendid. Tell me, then, explicitly, what are your objections to Colonel\nHargrave?'\n\nLaura remained silent, for she knew not how to frame her reply. 'Is it\npossible that he can be personally disagreeable to you?' continued\nMontreville. 'Disagreeable!' exclaimed Laura, thrown off her guard by\nastonishment. 'Colonel Hargrave is one whom any woman might--whom no\nwoman could know without--' 'Without what?' said Montreville, with a\ndelighted smile. But Laura, shocked at the extent of her own admission,\ncovered her face with her hands, and almost in tears, made no reply.\n\n'Well, my love,' said Montreville, more cheerfully than he had spoken\nfor many a day. 'I can interpret all this, and will not persecute you.\nBut you must still suffer me to ask what strange reasons could induce\nyou to reject wealth and title, offered by a man not absolutely\n_disagreeable_?' Laura strove to recollect herself, and deep crimson\ndying her beautiful face and neck, she said without venturing to lift\nher eyes, 'You yourself have told me, Sir, that Colonel Hargrave is a\nman of gallantry, and, believe me, with such a man I should be most\nmiserable.'\n\n'Come, come, Laura,' said Montreville, putting his arm around her,\n'confess, that some little fit of jealousy made you answer Hargrave\nunkindly at first, and that now a little female pride, or the obstinacy\nof which we used to accuse you fifteen years ago, makes you unwilling to\nretract.'\n\n'No, indeed,' returned Laura, with emotion, 'Colonel Hargrave has never\ngiven me cause to be jealous of his affection. But jealousy would feebly\nexpress the anguish with which his wife would behold his vices,\ndegrading him in the eyes of men, and making him vile in the sight of\nHeaven.'\n\n'My love,' said Montreville, 'your simplicity and ignorance of the world\nmake you attach far too great importance to Hargrave's little\nirregularities. I am persuaded that a wife whom he loved would have no\ncause to complain of them.'\n\n'She would at least have no _right_ to complain,' returned Laura, 'if,\nknowing them, she chose to make the hazardous experiment.'\n\n'But I am certain,' said Montreville, 'that a passion such as he\nevidently feels for you, would ensure his perfect reformation; and that\na heart so warm as Hargrave's, would readily acknowledge all the claims\nupon a husband's and a father's love.'\n\nLaura held down her head, and, for a moment, surrendered her fancy to\nprospects, rainbow-like, bright but unreal. Spite of the dictates of\nsober sense, the vision was cheering; and a smile dimpled her cheek\nwhile she said, 'But since this reformation is so easy and so certain,\nwould it be a grievous delay to wait for its appearance.'\n\n'Ah Laura!' Montreville began, 'this is no time for--' 'Nay, now,'\ninterrupted Laura, sportively laying her hand upon his mouth,\n'positively I will be no more lectured tonight. Besides I have got a new\nbook for you from the library, and the people insisted upon having it\nreturned to-morrow.' 'You are a spoiled girl,' said Montreville, fondly\ncaressing her, and he dropped the subject with the less reluctance,\nbecause he believed that his wishes, aided as he perceived they were, by\nan advocate in Laura's own breast, were in a fair train for\naccomplishment. He little knew how feeble was the influence of\ninclination over the decisions of her self-controlling spirit.\n\nTo prevent him from returning to the topic he had quitted, she read\naloud to him till his hour of rest; and then retired to her chamber to\nlabour as formerly, till the morning was far advanced.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nLaura had it now in her power to discharge her debt to the surgeon, and\nshe was resolved that it should immediately be paid. When, therefore, he\ncalled in the morning to make his daily visit, she met him before he\nentered Montreville's chamber, and requested to speak with him in the\nparlour.\n\nShe began by saying, she feared that medicine could be of little use to\nher father, to which Dr Flint readily assented, declaring, in his dry\nway, that generous food and open air would benefit him more than all the\ndrugs in London. Laura begged him to say explicitly so to the Captain,\nand to give that as a reason for declining to make him any more\nprofessional visits. She then presented him a paper containing four\nguineas, which she thought might be the amount of his claim. He took the\npaper, and deliberately unfolding it, returned one-half of its contents;\nsaying, that his account had been settled so lately, that the new one\ncould not amount to more than the sum he retained. Laura, who having now\nno favour to beg, no debt that she was unable to pay, was no longer\nashamed of her poverty, easily opened to Dr Flint so much of her\nsituation as was necessary to instruct him in the part he had to act\nwith Montreville. He made no offer to continue his visits, even as an\nacquaintance, but readily undertook all that Laura required of him,\nadding, 'Indeed, Miss Montreville, I should have told your father long\nago that physic was useless to him, but whimsical people must have\nsomething to amuse them, and if he had not paid for my pills, he would\nfor some other man's.' He then went to Montreville, and finding him in\nbetter spirits than he had lately enjoyed, actually succeeded in\npersuading him, for that day at least, that no new prescription was\nnecessary, and that he could continue to use the old without the\ninspection of a surgeon.\n\nLaura's mind was much relieved by her having settled this affair to her\nwish; and when the Doctor was gone, she sat down cheerfully to her\ndrawing. Her meeting with Hargrave had lightened her heart of a load\nwhich had long weighed upon it more heavily than she was willing to\nallow; and, spite of poverty, she was cheerful. 'I have now only hunger\nand toil to endure,' thought she, smiling as gaily as if hunger and toil\nhad been trifles; 'but light will be my labours, for by them I can in\npart pay back my debt of life to my dear kind father. I am no more\nforlorn and deserted, for he is come who is sunshine to Laura's soul.\nThe cloud that darkened him has passed away, and he will brighten all my\nafter life. Oh fondly beloved! with thee I would have been content to\ntread the humblest path; but, if we must climb the steeps, together we\nwill court the breeze, together meet the storm. No time shall change the\nlove I bear thee. Thy step, when feeble with age, shall still be music\nto Laura's ear. When the lustre of the melting eyes is quenched, when\nthe auburn ringlet fades to silver, dearer shalt thou be to me than in\nall the pride of manly beauty. And when at last the dust shall cover us,\none tree shall shelter our narrow beds, and the wind that fans the\nflowers upon thy grave, shall scatter their fallen leaves upon mine.'\n\nCasting these thoughts into the wild extempore measures which are\nfamiliar to the labourers of her native mountains,[A] Laura was singing\nthem to one of the affecting melodies of her country, her sweet voice\nmade more sweet by the magic of real tenderness, when the door opened,\nand Hargrave himself entered.\n\n [A] See Jamieson's Popular Ballads, Vol. ii, p. 558.\n\nHe came, resolved to exert all his influence, to urge every plea which\nthe affection of Laura would allow him, in order to extort her consent\nto their immediate union; and he was too well convinced of his power to\nbe very diffident of success. Laura ceased her song in as much confusion\nas if her visitor had understood the language in which it was composed,\nor could have known himself to be the subject of it. He had been\nlistening to its close, and now urged her to continue it, but was unable\nto prevail. He knew that she was particularly sensible to the charms of\nmusic. He had often witnessed the effect of her own pathetic voice upon\nher feelings; and he judged that no introduction could be more proper to\na conference in which he intended to work on her sensibility. He\ntherefore begged her to sing a little plaintive air with which she had\noften drawn tears from his eyes. But Laura knew that, as her father was\nstill in bed, she could not without rudeness avoid a long t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate\nwith Hargrave, and therefore she did not choose to put her composure to\nany unnecessary test. She excused herself from complying with his\nrequest, but glad to find any indifferent way to pass the time, she\noffered to sing, if he would allow her to choose her own song, and then\nbegan a lively air, which she executed with all the vivacity that she\ncould command. The style of it was quite at variance with Hargrave's\npresent humour and design. He heard it with impatience; and scarcely\nthanking her said, 'Your spirits are high this morning, Miss\nMontreville.'\n\n'They are indeed,' replied Laura, gaily, 'I hope you have no intention\nto make them otherwise.'\n\n'Certainly not; though they are little in unison with my own. The\nmeditations of a restless, miserable night, have brought me to you.'\n\n'Is it the usual effect of a restless night to bring you abroad so early\nthe next morning?' said Laura, anxious to avoid a trial of strength in a\nsentimental conference.\n\n'I will be heard seriously,' said Hargrave, colouring with anger, 'and\nseriously too I must be answered.'\n\n'Nay,' said Laura, 'if you look so tremendous I shall retreat without\nhearing you at all.'\n\nHargrave, who instantly saw that he had not chosen the right road to\nvictory, checked his rising choler--'Laura,' said he, 'you have yourself\nmade me the victim of a passion ungovernable--irresistible; and it is\ncruel--it is ungenerous in you to sport with my uneasiness.'\n\n'Do not give the poor passion such hard names,' said Laura, smiling.\n'Perhaps you have never tried to resist or govern it.'\n\n'As soon might I govern the wind,' cried Hargrave, vehemently,--'as soon\nresist the fires of Heaven. And why attempt to govern it?'\n\n'Because,' answered Laura, 'it is weak, it is sinful, to submit\nunresisting to the bondage of an imperious passion.'\n\n'Would that you too would submit unresisting to its bondage!' said\nHargrave, delighted to have made her once more serious. 'But if this\npassion is sinful,' continued he, 'my reformation rests with you alone.\nPut a period to my lingering trial. Consent to be mine, and hush all\nthese tumults to rest.'\n\n'Take care how you furnish me with arguments against yourself,' returned\nLaura, laughing. 'Would it be my interest, think you, to lull all these\ntransports to such profound repose?'\n\n'Be serious Laura, I implore you. Well do you know that my love can end\nonly with my existence, but I should no longer be distracted with these\ntumultuous hopes and fears if--' 'Oh,' cried Laura, interrupting him,\n'hope is too pleasing a companion for you to wish to part with that;\nand,' added she, a smile and a blush contending upon her cheek, 'I begin\nto believe that your fears are not very troublesome.' 'Ah Laura,' said\nHargrave sorrowfully, 'you know not what you say. There are moments when\nI feel as if you were already lost to me--and the bare thought is\ndistraction. Oh if you have pity for real suffering,' continued he,\ndropping on his knees, 'save me from the dread of losing you; forget the\nhour of madness in which I offended you. Restore to me the time when you\nowned that I was dear to you. Be yet more generous, and give me\nimmediate, unalienable right to your love.'\n\n'You forget, Colonel Hargrave,' said Laura, again taking sanctuary in an\nappearance of coldness; 'you forget that six months ago I fixed two\nyears of rectitude as the test of your repentance, and that you were\nthen satisfied with my decision.'\n\n'I would then have blessed you for any sentence that left me a hope,\nhowever distant; but now the time when I may claim your promise seems at\nsuch a hopeless distance--Oh Laura, let me but prevail with you; and I\nwill bind myself by the most solemn oaths to a life of unsullied\npurity.'\n\n'No oaths,' replied Laura with solemnity, 'can strengthen the ties that\nalready bind you to a life of purity. That you are of noble rank, calls\nyou to be an example to others; and the yet higher distinction of an\nimmortal spirit bids you strive after virtues that may never meet the\neye of man. Only convince me that such are the objects of your ambition,\nand I shall no longer fear to trust with you my improvement and my\nhappiness.'\n\nAs she spoke unusual animation sparkled in her eyes, and tinged her\ndelicate cheek with brighter colouring. 'Lovely, lovely creature!' cried\nHargrave, in transport, 'give but thyself to these fond arms, and may\nHeaven forsake me if I strive not to make thee blest beyond the sweetest\ndreams of youthful fancy.'\n\n'Alas!' said Laura, 'even your affection would fail to bless a heart\nconscious of acting wrong.'\n\n'Where is the wrong,' said Hargrave, gathering hope from the relenting\ntenderness of her voice, 'Where is the wrong of yielding to the\nstrongest impulse of nature--or, to speak in language more like your\nown, where is the guilt of submitting to an ordinance of Heaven's own\nappointment?'\n\n'Why,' replied Laura, 'will you force me to say what seems unkind? Why\ncompel me to remind you that marriage was never meant to sanction the\nunholy connection of those whose principles are discordant?'\n\n'Beloved of my heart,' said Hargrave, passionately kissing her hand,\n'take me to thyself, and mould me as thou wilt. I swear to thee that not\neven thine own life shall be more pure, more innocent than mine. Blest\nin thy love, what meaner pleasure could allure me. Oh yield then, and\nbind me for ever to virtue and to thee.'\n\nLaura shook her head. 'Ah Hargrave,' said she, with a heavy sigh,\n'before you can love and practice the purity which reaches the heart,\nfar other loves must warm, far other motives inspire you.'\n\n'No other love can ever have such power over me,' said Hargrave with\nenergy. 'Be but thou and thy matchless beauty the prize, and every\ndifficulty is light, every sacrifice trivial.'\n\n'In little more than a year,' said Laura, 'I shall perhaps ask some\nproofs of the influence you ascribe to me; but till then'--\n\n'Long, long before that time,' cried Hargrave, striking his forehead in\nagony, 'you will be lost to me for ever,' and he paced the room in\nseeming despair. Laura looked at him with a pity not unmixed with\nsurprise. 'Hear me for a moment,' said she, with the soothing voice and\ngentle aspect, which had always the mastery of Hargrave's feelings, and\nhe was instantly at her side, listening with eagerness to every tone\nthat she uttered, intent on every variation of her countenance.\n\n'There are circumstances,' she continued, her transparent cheek glowing\nwith bright beauty, tears in her downcast eyes trembling through the\nsilken lashes--'There are circumstances that may change me, but time and\nabsence are not of the number. Be but true to yourself, and you have\nnothing to fear. After this assurance, I trust it will give you little\npain to hear that, till the stipulated two years are ended, if we are to\nmeet, it must not be without witnesses.'\n\n'Good Heavens! Laura, why this new, this intolerable restriction--What\ncan induce you thus wilfully to torment me?'\n\n'Because,' answered the blushing Laura, with all her natural simplicity,\n'because I might not always be able to listen to reason and duty rather\nthan to you.'\n\n'Oh that I could fill thee with a love that should for ever silence the\ncold voice of reason!' cried Hargrave, transported by her confession;\nand, no longer master of himself, he would have clasped her in his arms.\nBut Laura, to whose mind his caresses ever recalled a dark page in her\nstory, recoiled as from pollution, the glow of ingenuous modesty giving\nplace to the paleness of terror.\n\nNo words envenomed with the bitterest malice, could have stung Hargrave\nto such frenzy as the look and the shudder with which Laura drew back\nfrom his embrace. His eyes flashing fire, his pale lips quivering with\npassion, he reproached her with perfidy and deceit; accused her of\nveiling her real aversion under the mask of prudence and principle; and\nexecrated his own folly in submitting so long to be the sport of a\ncold-hearted, tyrannical, obdurate woman. Laura stood for some minutes\ngazing on him with calm compassion. But displeased at his groundless\naccusations, she disdained to soothe his rage. At last, wearied of\nlanguage which, for the present, expressed much more of hatred than of\nlove, she quietly moved towards the door. 'I see you can be very calm,\nMadam,' said Hargrave, stopping her, 'and I can be as calm as yourself,'\nadded he, with a smile like a moon-beam on a thunder cloud, making the\ngloom more fearful.\n\n'I hope you soon will be so,' replied Laura coldly. 'I am so now,' said\nHargrave, his voice half-choked with the effort to suppress his passion.\n'I will but stay to take leave of your father, and then free you for\never from one so odious to you.'\n\n'That must be as you please, Sir,' said Laura, with spirit; 'but, for\nthe present, I must be excused from attending you.' She then retired to\nher own chamber, which immediately adjoined the painting-room; and with\ntears reflected on the faint prospects of happiness that remained for\nthe wife of a man whose passions were so ungovernable. Even the ardour\nof his love, for which vanity would have found ready excuse in many a\nfemale breast, was to Laura subject of unfeigned regret, as excluding\nhim from the dominion of better motives, and the pursuit of nobler ends.\n\nHargrave was no sooner left to himself than his fury began to evaporate.\nIn a few minutes he was perfectly collected, and the first act of his\nreturning reason was to upbraid him with his treatment of Laura. 'Is it\nto be wondered that she shrinks from me,' said he, the tears of\nself-reproach rising to his eyes, 'when I make her the sport of all my\nfrantic passions? But she shall never again have cause to complain of\nme--let but her love this once excuse me, and henceforth I will treat\nher with gentleness like her own.'\n\nThere is no time in the life of a man so tedious, as that which passes\nbetween the resolution to repair a wrong, and the opportunity to make\nthe reparation. Hargrave wondered whether Laura would return to conduct\nhim to her father; feared that she would not--hoped that she\nwould--thought he heard her footstep--listened--sighed--and tried to\nbeguile the time by turning over her drawings.\n\nAlmost the first that met his eye, was a sketch of features well known\nto him. He started and turned pale. He sought for a name upon the\nreverse; there was none, and he again breathed more freely. 'This must\nbe accident,' said he; 'De Courcy is far from London--yet it is very\nlike;' and he longed more than ever for Laura's appearance. He sought\nrefuge from his impatience in a book which lay upon the table. It was\nthe Pleasures of Hope, and marked in many parts of the margins with a\npencil. One of the passages so marked was that which begins,\n\n    'Thy pencil traces on the lover's thought\n    'Some cottage home, from towns and toil remote,\n    'Where love and lore may claim alternate hours,' &c.\n\nAnd Hargrave surrendered himself to the pleasing dream that Laura had\nthought of him, while she approved the lines. 'Her name, written by her\nown snowy fingers, may be here,' said he, and he turned to the\ntitle-page, that he might press it, with a lover's folly, to his\nlips--The title-page was inscribed with the name of Montague De Courcy.\n\nThe glance of the basilisk was not more powerful. Motionless he gazed on\nthe words, till all the fiends of jealousy taking possession of his\nsoul, he furiously dashed the book upon the ground 'False, false siren,'\nhe cried, 'is this the cause of all your coldness--your loathing?' And\nwithout any wish but to exclude her for ever from his sight, he rushed\nlike a madman out of the house.\n\nHe darted forward, regardless of the snow that was falling on his\nuncovered head, till it suddenly occurred to him that he would not\nsuffer her to triumph in the belief of having deceived him. 'No,' cried\nhe, 'I will once more see that deceitful face; reproach her with her\ntreachery; enjoy her confusion, and then spurn her from me for ever.'\n\nHe returned precipitately to the house; and, flying up stairs, saw\nLaura, the traces of melancholy reflection on her countenance, waiting\nfor admission at her father's door. 'Madam', said he, in a voice\nscarcely articulate, 'I must speak with you for a few minutes.' 'Not for\na moment, Sir,' said Laura, laying her hand upon the lock. 'Yes, by\nHeaven, you shall hear me,' cried Hargrave; and rudely seizing her, he\nforced her into the painting-room, and bolted the door.\n\n'Answer me,' said he fiercely, 'how came that book into your\npossession?' pointing to it as it still lay upon the floor. 'When have\nyou this infernal likeness? Speak!'\n\nLaura looked at the drawing, then at the book, and at once understood\nthe cause of her lover's frenzy. Sincere compassion filled her heart;\nyet she felt how unjust was the treatment which she received; and, with\ncalm dignity, said, 'I will answer all your questions, and then you will\njudge whether you have deserved that I should do so.'\n\n'Whom would not that face deceive?' said Hargrave, gnashing his teeth in\nagony. 'Speak sorceress--tell me, if you dare, that this is not the\nportrait of De Courcy--that he is not the lover for whom I am loathed\nand spurned.'\n\n'That is the portrait of De Courcy,' replied Laura, with the simple\nmajesty of truth. 'It is the sketch from which I finished a picture for\nhis sister. That book too is his,' and she stooped to lift it from the\nground. 'Touch not the vile thing,' cried Hargrave in a voice of\nthunder. With quiet self-possession, Laura continued, 'Mr De Courcy's\nfather was, as you know, the friend of mine. Mr De Courcy himself was,\nwhen an infant, known to my father; and they met, providentially met,\nwhen we had great need of a considerate friend. That friend Mr De Courcy\nwas to us, and no selfish motive sullied his benevolence; for he is not,\nnor ever was, nor, I trust, ever will be, known to me as a lover!'\n\nThe voice of sober truth had its effect upon Hargrave, and he said, more\ncomposedly, 'Will you then give me your word, that De Courcy is not, nor\never will be, dear to you?'\n\n'No!' answered Laura, 'I will not say so, for he must be loved wherever\nhis virtues are known; but I have no regard for him that should disquiet\nyou. It is not such,' continued she, struggling with the rising\ntears--'it is not such as would pardon outrage, and withstand neglect,\nand humble itself before unjust aspersion.'\n\n'Oh Laura,' said Hargrave, at once convinced and softened, 'I must\nbelieve you, or my heart will burst.'\n\n'I have a right to be believed,' returned Laura, endeavouring to rally\nher spirits. 'Now, then, release me, after convincing me that the\npassion of which you boast so much, is consistent with the most insolent\ndisrespect, the most unfounded suspicion.' But Hargrave was again at her\nfeet, exhausting every term of endearment, and breathing forth the most\nfervent petitions for forgiveness.\n\nTears, which she could no longer suppress, now streamed down Laura's\ncheeks, while she said, 'How could you suspect me of the baseness of\npretending a regard which I did not feel, of confirming engagements from\nwhich my affections revolted!' Hargrave, half wild with the sight of her\ntears, bitterly reproached himself with his injustice; vowed that he\nbelieved her all perfection; that, with all a woman's tenderness, she\npossessed the truth and purity of angels, and that, could she this once\npardon his extravagance, he would never more offend. But Laura, vexed\nand ashamed of her weakness, insisted on her release in a tone that\nwould be obeyed, and Hargrave, too much humbled to be daring,\nunwillingly suffered her to retire.\n\nIn the faint hope of seeing her again, he waited till Montreville was\nready to admit him; but Laura was not with her father, nor did she\nappear during the remainder of his visit. Desirous to know in what light\nshe had represented their affair, in order that his statement might\ntally with hers, he again avoided the subject, resolving that next day\nhe should be better prepared to enter upon it. With this view, he\nreturned to Montreville's lodgings early in the next forenoon, hoping\nfor an opportunity to consult with Laura before seeing her father. He\nwas shewn into the parlour, which was vacant. He waited long, but Laura\ncame not. He sent a message to beg that she would admit him, and was\nanswered that she was sorry it was not in her power. He desired the\nmessenger to say that his business was important, but was told that Miss\nMontreville was particularly engaged. However impatient, he was obliged\nto submit. He again saw Montreville without entering upon the subject so\nnear his heart; and left the house without obtaining even a glimpse of\nLaura.\n\nThe following day he was equally unsuccessful. He indeed saw Laura; but\nit was only in the presence of her father, and she gave him no\nopportunity of addressing her particularly. Finding that she adhered to\nthe resolution she had expressed, of seeing him no more without\nwitnesses, he wrote to her, warmly remonstrating against the barbarity\nof her determination, and beseeching her to depart from it, if only in a\nsingle instance. The billet received no answer, and Laura continued to\nact as before.\n\nFretted almost to fever, Hargrave filled whole pages with the\ndescription of his uneasiness, and complaints of the cruelty which\ncaused it. In conclusion, he assured Laura that he could no longer\nrefrain from confiding his situation to her father; and entreated to see\nher, were it only to learn in what terms she would permit him to mention\ntheir engagement. This letter was rather more successful than the\nformer; for, though Laura made no reply to the first part, she answered\nthe close by a few cautious lines, leaving Hargrave, excepting in one\npoint, at full liberty as to his communications with her father.\n\nThus authorized, he seized the first opportunity of conversing with\nMontreville. He informed him that he had reason to believe himself not\nindifferent to Laura; but that, some of his little irregularities coming\nto her knowledge, she had sentenced him to a probation which was yet to\ncontinue for above a year. Though Hargrave guarded his words so as to\navoid direct falsehood, the conscious crimson rose to his face as he\nuttered this subterfuge. But he took instant refuge in the idea that he\nhad no choice left; and that, if there was any blame, it in fact\nbelonged to Laura, for forcing him to use concealment. He did yet more.\nHe erected his head, and planted his foot more firmly, as he thought,\nthat what he dared to do he dared to justify, were he not proud to yield\nto the commands of love, and humanely inclined to spare the feelings of\na sick man. He proceeded to assure Montreville, that though he must\nplead guilty to a few youthful indiscretions, Laura might rely upon his\nconstancy and fidelity. Finally, addressing himself to what he conceived\nto be the predominant failing of age, he offered to leave the grand\naffair of settlements to Montreville's own decision; demanding only in\nreturn, that the father would use his interest, or even his authority,\nif necessary, to obtain his daughter's consent to an immediate union.\n\nMontreville answered, that he had long desisted from the use of\nauthority with Laura, but that his influence was at the Colonel's\nservice; and he added, with a smile, that he believed that neither would\nbe very necessary.\n\nIn consequence of this promise, Montreville sought an opportunity of\nconversing on this subject with his daughter; but she shewed such\nextreme reluctance to enter upon it, and avoided it with such sedulous\ncare, that he could not immediately execute his design. He observed,\ntoo, that she looked ill, that she was pale and languid. Though she\nwould not confess any ailment, he could not help fearing that all was\nnot right; and he waited the appearance of recovered strength, ere he\nshould enter on a topic which was never heard by her without strong\nemotion. But Laura looked daily more wretched. Her complexion became\nwan, her eyes sunk, and her lips colourless.\n\nHargrave observed the change, and, half persuaded that it was the effect\nof his own capricious behaviour at their last interview, he became more\nanxious for a private conference, in which his tenderness might sooth\nher to forgetfulness of his errors. When she was quitting the room, he\noften followed her to the door, and entreated to be heard for a single\nmoment. But the utmost he could obtain was a determined 'I cannot,' or a\nhasty 'I dare not,' and in an instant she had vanished.\n\nIndeed watching and abstinence, though the chief, were not the only\ncauses of Laura's sickly aspect. Hargrave's violence had furnished her\nwith new and painful subjects of meditation. While yet she thought him\nall perfection, he had often confessed to her the warmth of his temper,\nwith a candour which convinced her (anxious as she was to be so\nconvinced) that he was conscious of his natural tendency, and vigilantly\nguarded it from excess; consequently, that to the energy of the\npassionate he united the justice of the cool. She had never witnessed\nany instance of his violence; for since their first acquaintance, she\nhad herself, at least while she was present, been his only passion. All\nthings unconnected with it were trivial in his estimation; and till the\nhour which had roused her caution, she had unconsciously soothed this\ntyrant of his soul with perpetual incense, by proofs of her tenderness,\nwhich, though unobserved by others, were not lost upon the vanity of\nHargrave. Successful love shedding a placid gentleness upon his really\npolished manners, he had, without intention to deceive, completely\nmisled Laura's judgment of his character. Now he had turned her eyes\nfrom the vision, and compelled her to look upon the reality; and with\nmany a bitter tear she lamented that ever she suffered her peace to\ndepend upon an union which, even if accomplished, promised to compensate\ntransient rapture with abiding disquiet.\n\nBut still fondly attached, Laura took pleasure in persuading herself\nthat a mere defect of temper was not such a fault as entitled her to\nwithdraw her promise; and having made this concession, she soon\nproceeded to convince herself, that Hargrave's love would make ample\namends for occasional suffering, however severe. Still she assured\nherself that if, at the stipulated time, he produced not proofs of real\nimprovement, much more if that period were stained with actual vice, she\nwould, whatever it might cost her, see him no more. She determined to\nlet nothing move her to shorten his probation, nor to be satisfied\nwithout the strictest scrutiny into the manner in which it had been\nspent.\n\nAware of the difficulty of withstanding the imploring voice, the\npleading eyes of Hargrave, she would not venture into temptation for the\nmere chance of escape; and adhered to her resolution of affording him no\nopportunity to practise on her sensibility. Nor was this a slight\nexercise of self-denial, for no earthly pleasure could bring such joy to\nLaura's heart, as the assurance, however oft repeated, that she was\nbeloved. Yet, day after day, she withstood his wishes, and her own; and\ngenerally spent the time of his visits in drawing.\n\nMeanwhile, her delicate face and slender form gave daily greater\nindications of malady. Montreville, utterly alarmed, insisted upon\nsending for medical advice; but Laura, with a vehemence most unusual to\nher, opposed this design, telling him, that if he persisted in it,\nvexation would cause the reality of the illness which at present was\nmerely imaginary.\n\nThe Captain was however the only member of the family who did not\nconjecture the true cause of Laura's decay. The servant who attended\nher, reported to her mistress, that the slender repast was always\npresented, untouched by Laura, to her father; that her drink was only\nwater, her fare coarse and scanty; and that often, a few morsels of dry\nbread were the only sustenance of the day. Mrs Stubbs, who entertained a\nsuitable contempt for poverty, was no sooner informed of these\ncircumstances, than she recollected with indignation the awe with which\nLaura had involuntarily inspired her; and determined to withdraw part of\nher misplaced respect. But Laura had an air of command, a quiet majesty\nof demeanour, that seemed destined to distance vulgar impertinence; and\nMrs Stubbs was compelled to continue her unwilling reverence.\nDetermined, however, that though her pride might suffer, her interest\nshould not, she dropped such hints as induced Laura to offer the payment\nof the lodgings a week in advance, an offer which was immediately\naccepted.\n\nIn spite of Laura's utmost diligence, this arrangement left her almost\npennyless. She was obliged, in that inclement season, to give up even\nthe comfort of a fire; and more than once passed the whole night in\nlabouring to supply the wants of the following day.\n\nIn the meantime, Hargrave continued to pay his daily visits, and Laura\nto frustrate all his attempts to speak with her apart. His patience was\nentirely exhausted. He urged Montreville to the performance of his\npromise, and Montreville often approached the subject with his daughter,\nbut she either evaded it, or begged with such pathetic earnestness to be\nspared a contest which she was unable to bear, that, when he looked on\nthe sickly delicacy of her frame, he had not courage to persecute her\nfurther. Convinced, however, that Laura's affections were completely\nengaged, he became daily more anxious that she should not sacrifice them\nto what he considered as mistaken prudence; especially since Hargrave\nhad dropped a hint, which, though not so intended, had appeared to\nMontreville to import, that his addresses, if rejected in the present\ninstance, would not be renewed at the distant date to which Laura chose\nto postpone them.\n\nThe father's constant anxiety for the health and happiness of his child\npowerfully affected both his strength and spirits; and he was soon more\nlanguid and feeble than ever. His imagination, too, betrayed increased\nsymptoms of its former disease, and he became more persuaded that he was\ndying. The selfishness of a feeble mind attended his ailments, and he\ngrew less tender of his daughter's feelings, less fearful to wound her\nsensibility. To hints of his apprehensions for his own life, succeeded\ndirect intimations of his conviction that his end was approaching; and\nLaura listened, with every gradation of terror, to prophetic forebodings\nof the solitude, want, and temptation, to which she must soon be\nabandoned.\n\nPressed by Hargrave's importunities, and weary of waiting for a\nvoluntary change in Laura's conduct towards her lover, Montreville at\nlast resolved that he would force the subject which she was so anxious\nto shun. For this purpose, detaining her one morning in his apartment,\nhe entered on a melancholy description of the perils which await\nunprotected youth and beauty; and explicitly declared his conviction,\nthat to these perils he must soon leave his child. Laura endeavoured, as\nshe was wont, to brighten his dark imagination, and to revive his\nfainting hope. But Montreville would now neither suffer her to enliven\nher prospects, nor to divert him from the contemplation of them. He\npersisted in giving way to his dismal anticipations, till, spite of her\nefforts, Laura's spirits failed her, and she could scarcely refrain from\nshedding tears.\n\nMontreville saw that she was affected; and fondly putting his arm round\nher, continued, 'Yet still, my sweet Laura, you, who have been the pride\nof my life, you can soften to me the bitterness of death. Let me but\ncommit you to the affection of the man whom I know that you prefer, and\nmy fears and wishes shall linger no more in this nether world.'\n\n'Oh Sir,' said Laura, 'I beseech, I implore you to spare me on this\nsubject.' 'No!' answered Montreville, 'I have been silent too long. I\nhave too long endangered your happiness, in the dread of giving you\ntransient pain. I must recur to'--\n\n'My dear father,' interrupted Laura, 'I have already spoken to you on\nthis subject--spoken to you with a freedom which I know not where I\nfound courage to assume. I can only repeat the same sentiments; and\nindeed, indeed, unless you were yourself in my situation, you cannot\nimagine with what pain I repeat them.'\n\n'I would willingly respect your delicacy,' said Montreville, 'but this\nis no time for frivolous scruples. I must soon leave thee, child of my\naffections! My eyes must watch over thee no more; my ear must be closed\nto the voice of thy complaining. Oh then, give me the comfort to know\nthat other love will console, other arms protect thee.'\n\n'Long, long,' cried Laura, clasping his neck, 'be your affection my\njoy--long be your arms my shelter. But alas! what love could console me\nunder the sense of acting wrong--what could protect me from an avenging\nconscience?'\n\n'Laura, you carry your scruples too far. When I look on these wan cheeks\nand lustreless eyes, you cannot conceal from me that you are sacrificing\nto these scruples your own peace, as well as that of others.'\n\n'Ah Sir,' said Laura, who from mere despair of escape, gathered courage\nto pursue the subject, 'What peace can I hope to find in a connexion\nwhich reason and religion alike condemn?'\n\n'That these have from childhood been your guides, has ever been my joy\nand my pride,' returned Montreville. 'But in this instance you forge\nshackles for yourself, and then call them the restraints of reason and\nreligion. It were absurd to argue on the reasonableness of preferring\nwealth and title, with the man of your choice, to a solitary struggle\nwith poverty, or a humbling dependence upon strangers. And how, my dear\ngirl, can any precept of religion be tortured into a restriction on the\nfreedom of your choice?'\n\n'Pardon me, Sir, the law which I endeavour to make my guide is here full\nand explicit. In express terms it leaves me free to marry whom I will,\nbut with this grand reservation, that I marry \"only in the Lord.\" It\ncannot be thought that this limitation refers only to a careless assent\nto the truth of the Gospel, shedding no purifying influence on the heart\nand life. And can I hope for happiness in a wilful defiance of this\nrestriction?'\n\n'If I could doubt,' said Montreville, avoiding a reply to what was\nunanswerable--'if I could doubt that a union with Colonel Hargrave would\nconduce to your happiness, never should I thus urge you. But I have no\nreason to believe that his religious principles are unsound, though the\nfollies incident to his sex, and the frailty of human nature, may have\nprevailed against him.'\n\n'My dear Sir,' cried Laura impatiently, 'how can you employ such\nqualifying language to express--what my soul sickens at. How can my\nfather urge his child to join to pollution this temple, (and she laid\nher hand emphatically on her breast) which my great master has offered\nto hallow as his own abode? No! the express command of Heaven forbids\nthe sacrilege, for I cannot suppose that when man was forbidden to\ndegrade himself by a union with vileness, the precept was meant to\nexclude the sex whose feebler passions afford less plea for yielding to\ntheir power.'\n\n'Whither does this enthusiasm hurry you?' said Montreville, in\ndispleasure. 'Surely you will not call your marriage with Colonel\nHargrave a union with vileness.' 'Yes,' returned Laura, all the glow of\nvirtuous animation fading to the paleness of anguish, 'if his vices make\nhim vile, I must call it so.'\n\n'Your language is much too free, Laura, as your notions are too rigid.\nIs it dutiful, think you, to use such expressions in regard to a\nconnexion which your father approves? Will you call it virtue to sport\nwith your own happiness, with the peace of a heart that doats upon\nyou--with the comfort of your dying parent?'\n\n'Oh my father,' cried Laura, sinking on her knees, 'my spirit is already\nbowed to the earth--do not crush it with your displeasure. Rather\nsupport my feeble resolution, lest, knowing the right, I should not have\npower to choose it.'\n\n'My heart's treasure,' said Montreville, kissing the tears from her\neyes, 'short ever is my displeasure with thee: for I know that though\ninexperience may mislead thy judgment, no pleasure can bribe, no fear\nbetray thy inflexible rectitude. Go on then--convince me if thou canst,\nthat thou art in the right to choose thy portion amidst self-denial, and\nobscurity, and dependence.'\n\n'Would that I were able to convince you,' returned Laura, 'and then you\nwould no longer add to the difficulties of this fearful struggle. Tell\nme then, were Colonel Hargrave your son, and were I what I cannot name,\ncould any passion excuse, any circumstances induce you to sanction the\nconnexion for which you now plead?'\n\n'My dear love,' said Montreville, 'the cases are widely different. The\nworld's opinion affixes just disgrace to the vices in your sex, which in\nours it views with more indulgent eyes.' 'But I,' returned Laura, 'when\nI took upon me the honoured name of Christian, by that very act became\nbound that the opinion of the world should not regulate my principles,\nnor its customs guide my practice. Perhaps even the worst of my sex\nmight plead that the voice of a tempter lured them to perdition; but\nwhat tongue can speak the vileness of that tempter!--Could I promise to\n_obey_ him who wilfully leads others to their ruin! Could I _honour_ him\nwho deceives the heart that trusteth in him! Could I _love_ him who\ncould look upon a fellow creature--once the image of the highest, now\nhumbled below the brutes that perish--upon the heir of immortality,\nimmortal only to misery, and who could, unmoved, unpitying, seek in the\nfallen wretch a minister of pleasure!--Love!' continued Laura,\nforgetting in the deformity of the hideous image that it was capable of\nindividual application, 'words cannot express the energy of my\nabhorrence!'\n\n'Were Hargrave such--or to continue such'--said Montreville--'Hargrave!'\ncried Laura, almost with a shriek, 'Oh God forbid--And yet'--She covered\nher face with her hands, and cold drops stood on her forehead, as she\nremembered how just cause she had to dread that the portrait might be\nhis.\n\n'Hargrave,' continued Montreville, 'is not an abandoned profligate,\nthough he may not have escaped the follies usual to men of his rank; and\nhe has promised, if you will be favourable to him, to live henceforward\nin irreproachable purity. Heaven forgives the sins that are forsaken,\nand will you be less lenient?'\n\n'Joyfully will I forgive,' replied Laura, 'when I am assured that they\nare indeed abhorred and forsaken'--'They are already forsaken,' said\nMontreville; 'it rests with you to confirm Hargrave in the right, by\nconsenting to his wishes.'\n\n'I ask but the conviction which time alone can bring,' said Laura, 'and\nthen'--\n\n'And how will you bear it, Laura, if, weary of your perverse delays,\nHargrave should relinquish his suit? How would you bear to see the\naffections you have trifled with transferred to another?'\n\n'Better, far better,' answered Laura, 'than to watch the deepening of\nthose shades of iniquity, that close at last into outer darkness: better\nthan to see each guilty day advance and seal our eternal separation. To\nlose his affection,' continued she with a sickly smile, 'I would bear as\nI strive to bear my other burdens; and should they at last prove too\nheavy for me, they can but weigh me to the earth, where they and I must\nsoon rest together.'\n\n'Talk not so, beloved child,' said Montreville, 'a long life is before\nyou. All the joys that ambition, all the joys that love can offer, are\nwithin your power. A father invites, implores, I will not say commands,\nyou to accept them. The man of your choice, to whom the proudest might\naspire, whom the coldest of your sex might love, entreats you to confirm\nhim in the ways of virtue. Consent then to this union, on which my heart\nis set, while yet it can be hallowed by the blessing of your dying\nfather.'\n\n'Oh take pity on me,' Laura would have said, and 'league not with my\nweak heart to betray me,' but convulsive sobs were all that she could\nutter. 'You consent then,' said Montreville, choosing so to interpret\nher silence--'you have yielded to my entreaties, and made me the\nhappiest of fathers.' 'No! no!' cried Laura, tossing her arms\ndistractedly, 'I will do right though my heart should break. No, my\nfather, my dear honoured father, for whom I would lay down my life, not\neven your entreaties shall prevail.'\n\n'Ungrateful child,' said Montreville; 'what could you have pleaded for,\nthat your father would have refused--your father whom anxiety for your\nwelfare has brought to the gates of the grave, whose last feeling shall\nbe love to you, whose last words shall bless you.'\n\n'Oh most merciful, most gracious,' cried Laura, clasping her hands, and\nraising her eyes in resigned anguish, 'wilt thou suffer me to be tempted\nabove what I am able to bear! Oh my dear father, if you have pity for\nmisery unutterable, misery that cannot know relief, spare me now, and\nsuffer me to think--if to think be yet possible.'\n\n'Hear me but for one moment more,' said Montreville, who from the\nviolence of her emotion gathered hopes of success. 'Oh no! no!' cried\nLaura, 'I must leave you while yet I have the power to do right.' And,\ndarting from his presence, she shut herself into her chamber. There,\nfalling on her knees, she mingled bitter expressions of anguish, with\nfervent prayers for support, and piteous appeals for mercy.\n\nBecoming by degrees more composed, she endeavoured to fortify her\nresolution by every argument of reason and religion which had formerly\nguided her determination. She turned to the passages of Scripture which\nforbid the unequal yoke with the unbeliever; convinced that the\nprohibition applies no less to those whose lives are unchristian, than\nto those whose faith is unsound. She asked herself whether she was able\nto support those trials (the severest of all earthly ones,) which the\nwife of a libertine must undergo; and whether, in temptations which she\nvoluntarily sought, and sorrows which she of choice encountered, she\nshould be entitled to expect the divine support. 'Holy Father,' she\ncried, 'what peace can enter where thy blessing is withheld! and shall I\ndare to mock thee with a petition for that blessing on a union which\nthou has forbidden! May I not rather fear that this deliberate\npremeditated guilt may be the first step in a race of iniquity! May I\nnot dread to share in the awful sentence of those who are joined to\ntheir idols, and be \"let alone\" to wander in the way that leadeth to\ndestruction?'\n\nYet, as oft as her father's entreaties rose to her recollection, joined\nwith the image of Hargrave--of Hargrave beseeching, of Hargrave\nimpassioned--Laura's resolution faltered; and half-desirous to deceive\nherself, she almost doubted of the virtue of that firmness that could\nwithstand a parent's wish. But Laura was habitually suspicious of every\nopinion that favoured her inclinations, habitually aware of the\ndeceitfulness of her own heart; and she did not, unquestioned, harbour\nfor a moment the insidious thought that flattered her strongest wishes.\n'And had my father commended me to marry where I was averse,' said she,\n'would I then have hesitated? Would my father's command have prevailed\non me then to undertake duties which I was unlikely to perform? No:\nthere I would have resisted. There, authority greater than a father's\nwould have empowered me to resist; and I know that I should have\nresisted even unto death. And shall mere inclination give more firmness\nthan a sense of duty! Yet, Oh dear father, think me not unmindful of all\nyour love--or forgetful of a debt that began with my being. For your\nsake cold and hunger shall be light to me--for you poverty and toil\nshall be pleasing. But what solitary sorrow could equal the pang with\nwhich I should blush before my children for the vices of their father!\nWhat is the wasting of famine to the mortal anguish of watching the\ndeclining love, the transferred desires, the growing depravity of my\nhusband!'\n\nIn thoughts and struggles like these, Laura passed the day alone.\nMontreville, though disappointed at his ill success with his daughter,\nwas not without hope that a lover's prayers might prevail where a\nfather's were ineffectual; and believing that the season of Laura's\nemotion was a favourable one for the attempt, he was anxious for the\ndaily visit of Hargrave.\n\nBut, for the first time since his meeting with Laura, Hargrave did not\nappear. In her present frame, Laura felt his absence almost a relief;\nbut Montreville was uneasy and half alarmed. It was late in the evening\nwhen a violent knocking at the house door startled Montreville, who was\nalone in his apartment; and the next minute, without being announced,\nHargrave burst into the room. His hair was dishevelled, his dress\nneglected, and his eyes had a wildness which Montreville had never\nbefore seen in them. Abruptly grasping Montreville's hand, he said, in a\nvoice of one struggling for composure, 'Have you performed your\npromise--have you spoken with Laura?'\n\n'I have,' answered Montreville; 'and have urged her, till, had you seen\nher, you would yourself have owned that I went too far. But you look'--\n\n'Has she consented,' interrupted Hargrave--'will she give herself to\nme?'\n\nMontreville shook his head. 'Her affections are wholly yours,' said he,\n'you may yourself be more successful--I fervently wish that you may. But\nwhy this strange emotion? What has happened?'\n\n'Nothing, nothing,' said Hargrave, 'ask me no questions; but let me\nspeak instantly with Laura.'\n\n'You shall see her,' returned Montreville, opening the door, and calling\nLaura, 'Only I beseech you to command yourself, for my poor child is\nalready half distracted.' 'She is the fitter to converse with me,' said\nHargrave, with a ghastly smile, 'for I am upon the very verge of\nmadness.'\n\nLaura came at her father's summons; but when she saw Hargrave, the\ncolour faded from her face, an universal tremour seized her, she\nstopped, and leaned on the door for support. 'Colonel Hargrave wishes to\nspeak with you alone,' said Montreville, 'go with him to the parlour.'\n\n'I cannot,' answered Laura, in words scarcely audible--'this night I\ncannot.'\n\n'I command you to go,' said the father in a tone which he had seldom\nemployed, and Laura instantly prepared to go. 'Surely, surely,' said\nshe, 'Heaven will not leave me to my own weakness, whilst I act in\nobedience to you.'\n\nPerceiving that she trembled violently, Hargrave offered her the support\nof his circling arm; but Laura instantly disengaged herself. 'Will you\nnot lean on me, dearest Laura,' said he; 'perhaps it is for the last\ntime.'\n\n'I hope,' answered Laura, endeavouring to exert her spirit, 'it will be\nthe last time that you will avail yourself of my father's authority to\nconstrain me.'\n\n'Spare me your reproaches, Laura,' said Hargrave, 'for I am desperate.\nAll that I desire on earth--my life itself depends upon this hour.'\n\nThey entered the parlour, and Laura, sinking into a seat, covered her\neyes with her hand, and strove to prepare for answering this new call\nupon her firmness.\n\nHargrave stood silent for some moments. Fain would he have framed a\nresistless petition; for the events of that day had hastened the\nunravelling of a tale which, once known to Laura, would, he knew, make\nall his petitions vain. But his impatient spirit could not wait to\nconciliate; and, seizing her hand, he said, with breathless eagerness,\n'Laura, you once said that you loved me, and I believed you. Now to the\nproof--and if that fail--But I will not distract myself with the\nthought. You have allowed me a distant hope. Recall your sentence of\ndelay. Circumstances which you cannot--must not know, leave you but one\nalternative. Be mine now, or you are for ever lost to me.'\n\nAstonished at his words, alarmed by the ill-suppressed vehemence of his\nmanner, Laura tried to read his altered countenance, and feared she knew\nnot what. 'Tell me what you mean?' said she. 'What mean these strange\nwords--these wild looks. Why have you come at this late hour?'\n\n'Ask me nothing,' cried Hargrave, 'but decide. Speak. Will you be\nmine--now--to-morrow--within a few hours. Soon, very soon, it will be no\nlonger possible for you to choose.'\n\nA hectic of resentment kindled in Laura's cheek at the threat of\ndesertion which she imagined to lurk beneath the words of Hargrave. 'You\nhave,' said she, 'I know not how, extended my conditional promise to\nreceive you as a friend far beyond what the terms of it could warrant.\nIn making even such an engagement, perhaps I condescended too far. But,\nadmitting it in your own sense, what right have you to suppose that I\nam to be weakly terrified into renouncing a resolution formed on the\nbest grounds?'\n\n'I have no right to expect it,' said Hargrave, in a voice of misery. 'I\ncame to you in desperation. I cannot--will not survive the loss of you;\nand if I prevail not now, you must be lost to me.'\n\n'What means this strange, this presuming haste?' said Laura. 'Why do you\nseem thus wretched?'\n\n'I am, indeed, most wretched. Oh Laura, thus on my knees I conjure you\nto have pity on me;--or, if it will cost you a pang to lose me, have\npity on yourself. And if thy love be too feeble to bend thy stubborn\nwill, let a father's wishes, a father's prayers, come to its aid.'\n\n'Oh Hargrave,' cried Laura, bursting into tears, 'how have I deserved\nthat you should lay on me this heavy load--that you should force me to\nresist the entreaties of my father.'\n\n'Do not--Oh do not resist them. Let a father's prayers--let the\npleadings of a wretch whose reason, whose life depends upon you, prevail\nto move you.'\n\n'Nothing shall move me,' said Laura, with the firmness of despair, 'for\nI am used to misery, and will bear it.'\n\n'And will you bear it too if driven from virtuous love--from domestic\njoy, I turn to the bought smile of harlots, forget you in the haunts of\nriot, or in the grave of a suicide?'\n\n'Oh for mercy,' cried the terrified Laura, 'talk not so dreadfully. Be\npatient--I implore you. Fear not to lose me. Be but virtuous, and no\npower of man shall wrest me from you. In poverty--in sickness--in\ndisgrace itself I will cleave to you.'\n\n'Oh, I believe it,' said Hargrave, moved even to woman's weakness, 'for\nthou art an angel. But wilt though cleave to me in--'\n\n'In what', said Laura.\n\n'Ask me nothing--but yield to my earnest entreaty. Save me from the\nhorrors of losing you; and may Heaven forsake me if ever again I give\nyou cause to repent of your pity.'\n\nSoftened by his imploring looks and gestures, overpowered by his\nvehemence, harassed beyond her strength, Laura seemed almost expiring.\nBut the upright spirit shared not the weakness of its frail abode.\n'Cease to importune me,' said she;--'everlasting were my cause of\nrepentance, should I wilfully do wrong. You may break my heart--it is\nalready broken, but my resolution is immoveable.'\n\nFire flashed from the eyes of Hargrave; as, starting from her feet, he\ncried, in a voice of frenzy, 'Ungrateful woman, you have never loved\nme! You love nothing but the fancied virtue to which I am sacrificed.\nBut tremble, obdurate, lest I dash from me this hated life, and my\nperdition be on your soul!'\n\n'Oh no,' cried Laura, in an agony of terror, 'I will pray for you--pity\nyou,--what shall I say--love you as never man was loved. Would that it\nwere possible to do more!'\n\n'Speak then your final rejection,' said Hargrave, grasping her hand with\nconvulsive energy; 'and abide by the consequence.' 'I must not fear\nconsequences,' said Laura, trembling in every limb. 'They are in the\nhands of Heaven.' 'Then be this first fond parting kiss our last!' cried\nHargrave, and frantickly straining her to his breast, he rushed out of\nthe room.\n\nSurprise, confusion, a thousand various feelings kept Laura for a while\nmotionless; till, Hargrave's parting words ringing in her ears, a\ndreadful apprehension took possession of her mind. Starting from her\nseat, and following him with her arms as if she could still have\ndetained him, 'Oh Hargrave, what mean you?' she cried. But Hargrave was\nalready beyond the reach of her voice; and, sinking to the ground, the\nwretched Laura found refuge from her misery in long and deep\ninsensibility.\n\nIn the attitude in which she had fallen, her lily arms extended on the\nground, her death-like cheek resting upon one of them, she was found by\na servant who accidentally entered the room, and whose cries soon\nassembled the family. Montreville alarmed hastened down stairs, and came\nin just as the maid with the assistance of the landlady was raising\nLaura, to all appearance dead.\n\n'Merciful Heaven!' he exclaimed, 'what is this?' The unfeeling landlady\nimmediately expressed her opinion that Miss Montreville had died of\nfamine, declaring that she had long feared as much. The horror-struck\nfather had scarcely power to ask her meaning. 'Oh Sir,' said the maid,\nsobbing aloud, 'I fear it is but too true--for she cared not for\nherself, so you were but well--for she was the sweetest lady that ever\nwas born--and many a long night has she sat up toiling when the poorest\ncreature was asleep--for she never cared for herself.'\n\nThe whole truth flashed at once upon Montreville, and all the storm,\nfrom which his dutiful child so well had sheltered him, burst upon him\nin a moment. 'Oh Laura,' he cried, clasping her lifeless form, 'my only\ncomfort--my good--my gentle--my blameless child, has thou nourished thy\nfather with thy life! Oh why didst thou not let me die!' Then laying\nhis cheek to hers, 'Oh she is cold--cold as clay,' he cried, and the old\nman wrung his hands, and sobbed like an infant.\n\nSuddenly he ceased his lamentation; and pressing his hands upon his\nbreast, uttered a deep groan, and sunk down by the side of his senseless\nchild. His alarm and agitation burst again the blood-vessel, which\nbefore had been slightly healed, and he was conveyed to bed without hope\nof life. A surgeon was immediately found, but he administered his\nprescription without expecting its success; and, departing, left the\ndying Montreville to the care of the landlady.\n\nThe tender-hearted Fanny remained with Laura, and at last succeeded in\nrestoring her to animation. She then persuaded her to swallow a little\nwine, and endeavoured to prevail upon her to retire to bed. But Laura\nrefused. 'No, my kind, good girl,' said she, laying her arm gratefully\non Fanny's shoulder. 'I must see my father before I sleep. I have\nthwarted his will today, and will not sleep without his blessing.' Fanny\nthen besought her so earnestly not to go to the Captain's chamber, that\nLaura, filled as every thought was with Hargrave, took alarm, and would\nnot be detained. The girl, dreading the consequences of the shock that\nawaited her, threw her arms round her to prevent her departure. 'Let me\ngo,' cried Laura, struggling with her. 'He is ill; I am sure he is ill,\nor he would have come to watch and comfort his wretched child.'\n\nFanny then, with all the gentleness in her power, informed Laura that\nMontreville, alarmed by the sight of her fainting, had been suddenly\ntaken ill. Laura, in terror which effaced the remembrance of all her\nformer anguish, scarcely suffered her attendant to finish her relation;\nbut broke from her, and hurried as fast as her tottering limbs would\nbear her to her father's chamber.\n\nSoftly, on tiptoe, she stole to his bed-side, and drew the curtain. His\neyes were closed, and death seemed already stamped on every feature.\nLaura shuddered convulsively, and shrunk back in horror. But the dread\nof scaring the spirit from its frail tenement suppressed the cry that\nwas rising to her lips. Trembling she laid her hand upon his. He looked\nup, and a gleam of joy brightened in his dying eyes as they rested on\nhis daughter. 'Laura, my beloved,' said he, drawing her gently towards\nhim, 'thou has been the joy of my life. I thank God that thou art spared\nto comfort me in death.'\n\nLaura tried to speak the words of hope; but the sounds died upon her\nlips.\n\nAfter a pause of dread silence, Montreville said, 'This is the hour when\nthy father was wont to bless thee. Come, and I will bless thee still.'\n\nThe weeping Laura sank upon her knees, and Montreville laid one hand\nupon her hand, while she still held the other, as if wishing to detain\nhim. 'My best--my last blessing be upon thee, child of my heart,' said\nhe. 'The everlasting arms be around thee, when mine can embrace thee no\nmore. The Father of the fatherless be a parent to thee; support thee in\nsorrow; crown thy youth with joy--thy gray hairs with honour; and, when\nthou art summoned to thy kindred angels, may thy heart throb its last on\nsome breast kind and noble as thine own.'\n\nExhausted by the effort which he had made, Montreville sunk back on his\npillow; and Laura, in agony of supplication, besought Heaven to spare\nhim to her. 'Father of mercies!' she inwardly ejaculated, 'if it be\npossible, save me, oh save me from this fearful stroke,--or take me in\npity from this desolate wilderness to the rest of thy chosen.'\n\nThe dead of night came on, and all but the wretched Laura was still.\nMontreville breathed softly. Laura thought he slept, and stifled even\nher sighs, lest they should wake him. In the stillness of the dead, but\nin agony of suspence that baffles description, she continued to kneel by\nhis bed-side, and to return his relaxing grasp, till she felt a gentle\npressure of her hand, and looked up to interpret the gesture. It was the\nlast expression of a father's love. Montreville was gone!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nColonel Hargrave had been the spoiled child of a weak mother, and he\ncontinued to retain one characteristic of spoiled children; some\npowerful stimulant was with him a necessary of life. He despised all\npleasures of regular recurrence and moderate degree; and even looked\ndown upon those who could be satisfied with such enjoyments, as on\nbeings confined to a meaner mode of existence. For more than a year\nLaura had furnished the animating principle which kept life from\nstagnation. When she was present, her beauty, her reserve, her\nill-concealed affection, kept his passions in constant play. In her\nabsence, the interpretations of looks and gestures, of which she had\nbeen unconscious, and the anticipation of concessions which she thought\nnot of making, furnished occupation for the many hours which, for want\nof literary habit, Colonel Hargrave was obliged to pass in solitude and\nleisure, when deprived of fashionable company, public amusements, and\ntolerable romances. In a little country town, these latter resources\nwere soon exhausted, and Hargrave had no associates to supply the blank\namong his brother officers; some of whom were low both in birth and\neducation, and others, from various reasons, rather repelling, than\ncourting his intimacy. One had a pretty wife, another an unmarried\ndaughter; and the phlegmatic temperament and reserved manners of a third\ntallied not with Hargrave's constitutional warmth. The departure of\nLaura, therefore, deprived him at once of the only society that amused,\nand the only object that interested him. He was prevented by the caution\nof Mrs Douglas from attempting a correspondence with his mistress; and\nhis muse was exhausted with composing amatory sonnets, and straining\nhalf-imaginary torments into reluctant rhimes.\n\nHe soon tired of making sentimental visits to the now deserted\nGlenalbert, and grew weary of inspecting his treasures of pilfered\ngloves and stray shoe-bows. His new system of reform, too, sat rather\nheavily upon him. He was not exactly satisfied with its extent, though\nhe did not see in what respect he was susceptible of improvement. He had\nsome suspicion that it was not entitled to the full approbation of the\n'wise, the pious, the sober-minded' observers, whom he imagined that\nLaura had charged with the inspection of his conduct; and he reflected,\nwith a mixture of fear and impatience, that by them every action would\nbe reported to Laura, with all the aggravation of illiberal comment. For\nthough he did not distinctly define the idea to himself, he cherished a\nlatent opinion, that the 'wise' would be narrow-minded, the 'pious'\nbigotted, and the 'sober-minded' cynical. The feeling of being watched\nis completely destructive of comfort, even to those who have least to\nconceal; and Colonel Hargrave sought relief at once from restraint and\nennui, in exhibiting, at the Edinburgh races, four horses which were the\nenvy of all the gentleman, and a person which was the admiration of all\nthe ladies. His thoughts dissipated, and his vanity gratified, his\npassion had never, since its first existence, been so little troublesome\nas during his stay in Edinburgh; and once or twice, as he caught a\nlanguishing glance from a gay young heiress, he thought he had been a\nlittle precipitate in changing his first designs in regard to Laura. But\nalas! the races endure only for one short week; Edinburgh was deserted\nby its glittering birds of passage; and Hargrave returned to his\nquarters, to solitude, and to the conviction that, however obtained, the\npossession of Laura was necessary to his peace.\n\nFinding that her return was as uncertain as ever, he resolved to follow\nher to London; and the caution of Mrs Douglas baffling his attempts to\nprocure her address from any other quarter, he contrived to obtain it by\nbribing one of the under attendants of the Post Office to transcribe for\nhim the superscription of a letter to Miss Montreville. Delighted with\nhis success, he could not refuse himself the triumph of making it known\nto Mrs Douglas; and, by calling to ask her commands for her young\nfriend, occasioned the letter of caution from her to Laura, which has\nbeen formerly mentioned.\n\nThe moment he reached London, he hastened to make inquiries after the\nabode of Captain Montreville; but his search was disappointed by the\naccidents which he afterwards related to Laura. Day after day, he hoped\nthat Laura, by sending to Mr Baynard's chambers, would afford him the\nmeans of discovering her residence. But every day ended in\ndisappointment; and Hargrave, who, intending to devote all his time to\nher, had given no intimation to his friends of his arrival in town,\nfound himself as solitary, listless, and uncomfortable as before he\nquitted Scotland.\n\nOne evening, when, to kill the time, he had sauntered into the Theatre,\nhe renewed his acquaintance with the beautiful Lady Bellamer. Two years\nbefore, Hargrave had been the chief favourite of Lady Bellamer, then\nMiss Walpole. Of all the danglers whom beauty, coquetry, and fifty\nthousands pounds attracted to her train, none was admitted to such easy\nfreedom as Hargrave. She laughed more heartily at his wit, whispered\nmore familiarly in his ear, and slapped him more frequently on the cheek\nthan any of his rivals. With no other man was she so unreasonable,\ntroublesome, and ridiculous. In short, she ran through the whole routine\nof flirtation, till her heart was entangled, so far at least as the\nheart of a coquette is susceptible of that misfortune. But whatever\nflames were kindled in the lady's breast, the gentleman, as is usual on\nsuch occasions, escaped with a very slight tinge. While Miss Walpole was\npresent, his vanity was soothed by her blandishments, and his senses\ntouched by her charms; but, in her absence, he consoled himself with\nhalf a dozen other affairs of the same kind.\n\nMeanwhile Lord Bellamer entered the lists, and soon distinguished\nhimself from his competitors, by a question, which, with all her\nadmirers, Miss Walpole had not often answered. The lady hesitated; for\nshe could not help contrasting the insignificant starvling figure of her\nsuitor with the manly beauty of Hargrave's person. But Lord Bellamer had\na title in possession; Hargrave's was only reversionary. His Lordship's\nestate, too, was larger than the Colonel's expectations. Besides, she\nbegan to have doubts whether her favourite ever intended to propose the\nimportant question; for though, to awaken his jealousy, she had herself\ninformed him of Lord Bellamer's pretensions, and though she had played\noff the whole artillery of coquetry to quicken his operations, the young\nman maintained a resolute and successful resistance. So, after some\nfifty sighs given to the well turned leg and sparkling eyes of Hargrave,\nMiss Walpole became Lady Bellamer; and this was the only change which\nmarriage effected in her; for no familiarity could increase her\nindifference to Lord Bellamer, and no sacredness of connection can warm\nthe heart of a coquette. She continued equally assiduous in courting\nadmiration, equally daring in defying censure; and was content to\npurchase the adulation of fools, at the expence of being obliged to the\ncharity of those who were good-natured enough to say, 'to be sure Lady\nBellamer is a little giddy, but I dare say she means no harm.'\n\nHer husband's departure with his regiment for the continent, made no\nchange in her way of life, except to save her the trouble of defending\nconduct which she would not reform. She continued in London, or at her\nvilla at Richmond Hill, to enter into every folly which others proposed,\nor herself to project new ones.\n\nMeanwhile Hargrave's duty called him to Scotland, where Lady Bellamer\nand all her rivals in his attention were entirely forgotten amidst the\nsuperior attractions of Laura; attractions which acted with all the\nforce of novelty upon a heart accustomed to parry only premeditated\nattacks, and to resist charms that were merely corporeal. From an early\ndate in his acquaintance with Miss Montreville, he had scarcely\nrecollected the existence of Lady Bellamer, till he found himself in the\nnext box to her at the theatre. The pleasure that sparkled in the\nbrightest blue eyes in the world, the flush that tinged her face,\nwherever the rouge permitted its natural tints to appear, convinced\nHargrave in a moment that her Ladyship's memory had been more tenacious;\nand he readily answered to her familiar nod of invitation, by taking his\nplace at her side.\n\nThey entered into conversation with all the frankness of their former\nintimacy. Lady Bellamer inquired how the Colonel had contrived to exist\nduring eighteen months of rustication; and gave him in return memoirs of\nsome of their mutual acquaintances. She had some wit, and an exuberance\nof animal spirits; and she seasoned her nonsense with such lively\nsallies, sly scandal, and adroit flattery, that Hargrave had scarcely\never passed an evening so gaily. Once or twice, the composed grace, the\nartless majesty of Laura, rose to his recollections, and he looked\nabsent and thoughtful. But his companion rallied him with so much\nspirit, that he quickly recovered himself, and fully repaid the\namusement which he received. He accepted Lady Bellamer's invitation to\nsup with her after the play, and left her at a late hour, with a promise\nto visit her again the next day. From that time, the freedom of their\nformer intercourse was renewed; with this difference only, that Hargrave\nwas released from some restraint, by his escape from the danger of\nentanglement which necessarily attends particular assiduities towards an\nunmarried woman.\n\nLet the fair enchantress tremble who approaches even in thought the\nutmost verge of discretion. If she advance but one jot beyond that magic\ncircle, the evil spirit is ready to seize her, which before, feared even\nto rise in her presence. Lady Bellamer became the victim of unpardonable\nimprudence on her own part, and mere constitutional tendency on that of\nher paramour. To a most blameable levity she sacrificed whatever\nremained to be sacrificed, of her reputation, her virtue, and her\nmarriage vow; while the crime of Hargrave was not palliated by one\nsentiment of genuine affection; for she by whom he fell was no more like\nthe object of his real tenderness, than those wandering lights that\narise from corruption and glimmer only to betray, are to the steady\nsunbeam which enlightens, and guides, and purifies where it shines.\n\nTheir intercourse continued, with growing passion on the side of the\nlady, and expiring inclination on that of the gentleman, till Lady\nBellamer informed him that the consequences of their guilt could not\nlong be concealed. Her Lord was about to return to his disgraced home;\nand she called upon Hargrave to concert with her the means of exchanging\nshackles which she would no longer endure for bonds which she could bear\nwith pleasure, and himself to stand forth the legal protector of his\nunborn child. Hargrave heard her with a disgust which he scarcely strove\nto conceal; for at that moment Laura stood before him, bewitching in\nchastened love--respectable in saintly purity. He remembered that the\nbare proposal of a degradation which Lady Bellamer had almost courted,\nhad once nearly banished the spotless soul from a tenement only less\npure than itself. In fancy he again saw through her casement the\nwringing of those snowy hands, those eyes raised in agony, and the\nconvulsive heavings of that bosom which mourned his unlooked-for\nbaseness; and he turned from Lady Bellamer, inwardly cursing the hour\nwhen his vows to Laura were sacrificed to a wanton.\n\nThe very day after this interview was that in which he accidentally\nencountered Laura; and from that moment his whole desire was to make her\nhis own, before public report should acquaint her with his guilt. He\ndurst not trust to the strength of her affection for the pardon of so\nfoul an offence. He could not hope that she would again place confidence\nin vows of reformation which had been so grossly violated. When the\nproper self-distrust of Laura refused him the opportunity of making a\npersonal appeal to her sensibilities, he hoped that her father might\nsuccessfully plead his cause; and that before his guilt was known to\nher, he might have made it at once her interest and her duty to forget\nit. But the storm was about to burst even more speedily than he\napprehended. Lady Bellamer little suspected that her conduct was watched\nwith all the malice of jealousy, and all the eagerness of interest. She\nlittle suspected that her confidential servant was the spy of her\ninjured husband, bound to fidelity in this task by ties as disgraceful\nas they were strong, and that this woman waited only for legal proof of\nher mistress's guilt, to lay the particulars before her lord. That proof\nwas now obtained; and Lord Bellamer hastened to avail himself of it. He\narrived in London on the morning of the last day of Montreville's life;\nand, charging his guilty wife with her perfidy, expelled her from his\nhouse.\n\nShe flew to Hargrave's lodgings, and found him preparing for his daily\nvisit to Laura. Though provoked at being delayed, he was obliged to stay\nand listen to her, while she hastily related the events of the morning.\nShe was about to speak of her conviction, that, by making her his wife,\nhe would shield her from the world's scorn, and that he would not, by\nany legal defence, retard her emancipation. But Hargrave suffered her\nnot to proceed. He perceived that his adventure must now be public. It\nmust immediately find its way into the public prints; and in a few hours\nit might be in the hands of Laura. He bitterly upbraided Lady Bellamer\nwith her want of caution in the concealment of their amour; cursed her\nfolly as the ruin of all his dearest hopes; and, in the frenzy of his\nrage, scrupled not to reveal the cutting secret, that while another was\nthe true object of his affections, Lady Bellamer had sacrificed her all\nto an inclination as transient as it was vile. The wretched creature,\nterrified at his rage, weakened by her situation, overcome by the events\nof the morning, and stung by a reception so opposite to her\nexpectations, sunk at his feet in violent hysterics. But Hargrave could\nat that moment feel for no miseries but his own; and consigning her to\nthe care of the woman of the house, he was again about to hasten to\nMontreville's, when he was told that a gentleman wished to speak with\nhim upon particular business.\n\nThis person was the bearer of a note from Lord Bellamer, importing that\nhe desired to meet Colonel Hargrave on that or the following day, at any\nhour and place which the Colonel might appoint. After the injuries given\nand received, their meeting, he said, could have but one object.\nHargrave, in no humour to delay, instantly replied that in three hours\nhe should be found in a solitary field, which he named, at a few miles\ndistant from town, and that he should bring with him a friend and a\nbrace of pistols. He then went in search of this friend, and finding him\nat home, the business was speedily settled.\n\nNothing, in the slight consideration of death which Hargrave suffered to\nenter his mind, gave him so much disturbance as the thought that he\nmight, if he fell, leave Laura to the possession of another. He\nwillingly persuaded himself that she had an attachment to him too\nromantic to be transferable. But she was poor; she might in time make a\nmarriage of esteem and convenience; and Laura, the virtuous Laura, would\ncertainly love her husband, and the father of her children. The bare\nidea stung like a scorpion, and Hargrave hastened to his man of\nbusiness, where he spent the time which yet remained before the hour of\nhis appointment, in dictating a bequest of five thousand pounds to Laura\nMontreville; but true to his purpose, he added a clause, by which, in\ncase of her marriage, she forfeited the whole.\n\nHe then repaired to meet Lord Bellamer; and, the ground being taken,\nHargrave's first ball penetrated Lord Bellamer's left shoulder, who then\nfired without effect, and instantly fell. Hargrave, whose humanity had\nreturned with his temper, accompanied his wounded antagonist to a\nneighbouring cottage to which he was conveyed, anxiously procured for\nhim every possible comfort, and heard with real joy, that if he could be\nkept from fever, his wound was not likely to be mortal. The gentleman\nwho had been Hargrave's second, offered to remain near Lord Bellamer, in\norder to give warning to his friend should any danger occur; and it was\nlate in the evening before Hargrave, alone and comfortless, returned to\ntown.\n\nNever had his own thoughts been such vexatious companions. To his own\nscared conscience his crimes might have seemed trivial; but when he\nplaced them before him in the light in which he knew that they would be\nviewed by Laura, their nature seemed changed. He knew that she would\nfind no plea in the custom of the times, for endangering the life of a\nfellow-creature, and that her moral vocabulary contained no qualifying\nepithet to palliate the foulness of adultery. The next day would give\npublicity to his duel and its cause; and should the report reach Laura's\near, what could he hope from her favour? The bribes of love and ambition\nhe had found too poor to purchase her sanction to the bare intention of\na crime. Even the intention seemed forgiven only in the hope of luring\nhim to the paths of virtue: and when she should know the failure of that\nhope, would not her forgiveness be withdrawn?\n\nBut Laura, thus on the point of being lost, was more dear to him than\never; and often did he wish that he had fallen by Lord Bellamer's hand,\nrather than that he should live to see himself the object of her\nindifference, perhaps aversion. Time still remained, however, by one\ndesperate effort to hurry or terrify her into immediate compliance with\nhis wishes; and, half-distracted with the emotions of remorse, and love,\nand hope, and fear, he ordered his carriage to Montreville's house. Here\npassed the scene which has been already described. Hargrave was too much\nagitated to attend to the best methods of persuasion, and he quitted\nLaura in the full conviction that she would never be his wife. He threw\nhimself into his carriage, and was driven home, now frantickly bewailing\nhis loss, now vowing, that rather than endure it, he would incur the\npenalties of every law, divine and human. All night he paced his\napartment, uttering imprecations on his own folly, and forming plans for\nregaining by fraud, force, or persuasion, his lost rights over Laura. At\nlast his vehemence having somewhat spent itself, he threw himself on a\ncouch, and sunk into feverish and interrupted sleep.\n\nIt was not till next morning, that he thought of inquiring after the\nunfortunate partner of his iniquity; and was told that, too ill to be\nremoved, she had been carried to bed in the house, where she still\nremained.\n\nIntending to renew the attempt of the preceding night, he again repaired\nto Laura's house; but his intention was frustrated by the death of\nMontreville. On receiving the information, he was at first a good deal\nshocked at the sudden departure of a man, whom, a few hours before, he\nhad left in no apparent danger. But that feeling was effaced when once\nhe began to consider the event as favourable to his designs upon Laura.\nLeft to solitude, to poverty, perhaps to actual want, what resource had\nshe so eligible as the acceptance of offers splendid and disinterested\nlike his. And he would urge her acceptance of them with all the ardour\nof passion. He would alarm her with the prospects of desolateness and\ndependence, he would appeal to the wishes of her dead father. Such\npleadings must, he thought, have weight with her; and again the hopes of\nvictory revived in his mind. Should the principle, to which she so\nfirmly adhered, outweigh all these considerations, he thought she would\nforfeit by her obstinacy all claim to his forbearance, and his heart\nfluttered at the idea that she had now no protector from his power. He\nresolved to haunt, to watch her, to lose no opportunity of pressing his\nsuit. Wherever she went he was determined to follow; 'and surely,'\nthought he, 'she must have some moments of weakness, she cannot be\nalways on her guard.'\n\nFor some days he continued to make regular visits at her lodgings,\nthough he had no hope of seeing her till after Montreville was consigned\nto the dust; and he rejoiced that the customary seclusion was likely to\nretard her knowledge of his misconduct. To make inquiries after the\nhealth and spirits of Laura, was the ostensible, but not the only motive\nof his visits. He wished to discover all that was known to the people of\nthe house of her present situation and future plans. On the latter\nsubject they could not afford him even the slightest information, for\nLaura had never dropped a hint of her intentions. But he received such\naccounts of her pecuniary distresses, and of the manner in which she\nsupported them, as at once increased his reverence for her character,\nand his hopes that she would take refuge from her wants in the affluence\nwhich he offered her.\n\nFrom Fanny, who officiated as porter, and who almost adored Laura, he\nreceived most of his intelligence; and while he listened to instances of\nthe fortitude, the piety, the tenderness, the resignation of his\nbeloved, a love of virtue, sincere though transient, would cross his\nsoul; he would look back with abhorrence on a crime which had hazarded\nthe loss of such a treasure; and vow, that, were he once possessed of\nLaura, his life should be a copy of her worth. But Hargrave's vows\ndeceived him; for he loved the virtues only that were associated with an\nobject of pleasure, he abhorred the vices only which threatened him with\npain.\n\nOn the day succeeding the funeral, he ventured on an attempt to see\nLaura, and sent her a message, begging permission to wait upon her; but\nwas answered that she received no visitors. He then wrote to her a\nletter full of the sentiments which she inspired. He expressed his\nsympathy with her misfortunes, and fervently besought her to accept of a\nprotector who would outdo in tenderness the one she had lost. He\nimplored her to add the strongest incentive to the course of virtue, in\nwhich, if she would listen to his request, he solemnly promised to\npersevere. He again insinuated that she must speedily decide; that, if\nher decision were unfavourable, he might be driven to seek forgetfulness\namidst ruinous dissipation; and he adjured her, by the wishes of her\ndead father, a claim which he thought would with her be irresistible, to\nconsent to dispense with his further probation. He said he would visit\nher late in the following forenoon, in the hope of receiving his answer\nfrom her own lips; and concluded by telling her that, lest the late\nunfortunate event had occasioned her any temporary difficulties, he\nbegged to be considered as her banker, and enclosed a bill for a hundred\npounds.\n\nHe gave this letter to Fanny, with injunctions to deliver it\nimmediately, and then went to inquire for Lord Bellamer, whom it gave\nhim real pleasure to find pronounced out of danger. Lady Bellamer, too,\nhad ceased to reproach and molest him. She had recovered from her\nindisposition, and removed to the house of a relation, who humanely\noffered to receive her. His hopes were strong of the effect of his\nletter; and he passed the evening in greater comfort than had lately\nfallen to his share. Often did he repeat to himself that Laura must\naccede to his proposals. What other course could she pursue--Would her\nspirit allow her to become a burden on the scanty income of her friend\nMrs Douglas--Would she venture to pursue, as a profession, the art in\nwhich she so greatly excelled--Would she return to live alone at\nGlenalbert? This last appeared the most probable to Hargrave, because\nthe most desirable. Alone, without any companion whose frozen counsel\ncould counteract the softness of her heart, in a romantic solitude,\nwatched, as he would watch, importuned as he would importune her,\nstrange if no advantage could be wrested from her affection or her\nprudence, her interest or her fears! To possess Laura was the first wish\nof his soul; and he was not very fastidious as to the means of its\ngratification; for even the love of a libertine is selfish. He was\nperfectly sincere in his honourable proposals to Laura. He might have\nbeen less so had any others possessed a chance of success.\n\nHe rose early the next morning, and impatiently looked for the hour\nwhich he had appointed for his visit. He wished that he had fixed on an\nearlier one, took up a book to beguile the minutes, threw it down again,\nlooked a hundred times at his watch, ordered his carriage to the door\ntwo hours before it was wanted, feared to go too soon, lest Laura should\nrefuse to see him, and yet was at her lodgings, long before his\nappointment. He inquired for her, and was answered that she had\ndischarged her lodgings, and was gone. 'Gone! Whither?'--Fanny did not\nknow; Miss Montreville had been busy all the evening before in preparing\nfor her removal, and had left the house early that morning. 'And did she\nleave no address where she might be found?' 'I heard her tell the\ncoachman,' said Fanny, 'to stop at the end of Grosvenor-street, and she\nwould direct him where she chose to be set down. But I believe she has\nleft a letter for you, Sir.' 'Fool!' cried Hargrave, 'why did you not\ntell me so sooner--give it me instantly.'\n\nHe impatiently followed the girl to the parlour which had been\nMontreville's. The letter lay on the table. He snatched it, and hastily\ntore it open. It contained only his bill, returned with Miss\nMontreville's compliments and thanks. He twisted the card into atoms,\nand cursed with all his soul the ingratitude and cold prudence of the\nwriter. He swore that if she were on earth, he would find her; and vowed\nthat he would make her repent of the vexation which he said she had\nalways taken a savage delight in heaping upon him.\n\nRestless, and yet unwilling to be gone, he next wandered into Laura's\npainting-room, as if hoping in her once-favourite haunt to find traces\nof her flight. He had never entered it since the day when the discovery\nof De Courcy's portrait had roused his sudden frenzy. Association\nbrought back the same train of thought. He imagined that Laura, while\nshe concealed herself from him, had taken refuge with the De Courcys;\nand all his jealousy returned. After, according to custom, acting the\nmadman for a while, he began as usual to recover his senses. He knew he\ncould easily discover whether Miss Montreville was at Norwood, by\nwriting to a friend who lived in the neighbourhood; and he was going\nhome to execute this design, when, passing through the lobby, he was met\nby the landlady. He stopped to renew his inquiries whether any thing was\nknown, or guessed, of Laura's retreat. But Mrs Stubbs could give him no\nmore information on that subject than her maid, and she was infinitely\nmore surprised at his question than Fanny had been; for having made\ncertain observations which convinced her that Hargrave's visits were in\nthe character of a lover, she had charitably concluded, and actually\nasserted, that Laura had accepted of his protection.\n\nHargrave next inquired whether Laura had any visitors but himself? 'No\nliving creature,' was the reply. 'Could Mrs Stubbs conjecture whither\nshe was gone?' 'None in the world,' answered Mrs Stubbs; 'only this I\nknow, it can't be very far off--for to my certain knowledge, she had\nonly seven shillings in her pocket, and that could not carry her far, as\nI told the gentleman who was here this morning.' 'What gentleman?' cried\nHargrave. 'One Mr De Courcy, Sir, that used to call for her; but he has\nnot been here these six weeks before; and he seemed quite astounded as\nwell as yourself, Sir.' Hargrave then questioned her so closely\nconcerning De Courcy's words and looks, as to convince himself that his\nrival was entirely ignorant of the motions of the fugitive. In this\nbelief he returned home, uncertain what measures he should pursue, but\ndetermined not to rest till he had found Laura.\n\nWhen De Courcy quitted Laura, he had no intention of seeing her again\ntill circumstances should enable him to offer her his hand. No sacrifice\ncould have cost him more pain; but justice and filial duty did not\npermit him to hesitate. Neither did he think himself entitled to sadden\nwith a face of care his domestic circle, nor to make his mother and\nsister pay dear for their comforts, by shewing that they were purchased\nat the expence of his peace. Nor did he languidly resign to idle\nlove-dreams the hours which an immortal spirit claimed for its\nimprovement, and which the social tie bound him to enliven and cheer.\nBut to appear what he was not, to introduce constraint and dissimulation\ninto the sacred privacies of home, never occurred to De Courcy. He\ntherefore strove not to _seem_ cheerful but to _be_ so. He returned to\nhis former studies, and even prosecuted them with alacrity, for he knew\nthat Laura respected a cultivated mind. His faults, he was if possible\nmore than ever studious to correct, for Laura loved virtue. And when\noccasion for a kind considerate or self-denying action presented itself,\nhe eagerly seized it, saying in his heart, 'this is like Laura.'\n\nSometimes the fear that he might be forgotten, forced from him the\nbitterest sigh that he had ever breathed; but he endeavoured to comfort\nhimself with the belief that she would soon be screened from the gaze of\nadmiration, and that her regard for him, though yet in its infancy,\nwould be sufficient to secure her from other impressions. Of the reality\nof this regard he did not allow himself to doubt, or if he hesitated for\na moment, he called to mind the picture, Laura's concealment of it, her\nconfusion at his attempt to examine it, and he no longer doubted.\n\nThe arrival of the picture itself might have explained all that related\nto it, had De Courcy chosen to have it so explained. But he turned his\neye from the unpleasing sight, and sheltered his hopes by a hundred\ntreasured instances of love which had scarcely any existence but in his\nfancy.\n\nHis efforts to be cheerful were however less successful, after Laura, in\na few melancholy lines, informed Miss De Courcy that Montreville's\nincreased illness made their return to Scotland more uncertain than\never. He imagined his dear Laura the solitary attendant of a sickbed; no\nkind voice to comfort, no friendly face to cheer her; perhaps in\npoverty, that poverty increased too by the artifice which he had used to\nlessen it. He grew anxious, comfortless, and at length really miserable.\nEvery day the arrival of the letters was looked for with extreme\nsolicitude in hope of more cheering news; but every day brought\ndisappointment, for Laura wrote no more. His mother shared in his\nanxiety, and increased it by expressing her own. She feared that Miss\nMontreville was ill, and unable to write; and the image of Laura among\nstrangers, sick and in poverty, obliterated Montague's prudent\nresolutions of trusting himself no more in the presence of his beloved.\nHe set out for London, and arrived at the door of Laura's lodgings about\nan hour after she had quitted them.\n\nMrs Stubbs, of whom he made personal inquiries, was abundantly\ncommunicative. She gave him, as far as it was known to her, a full\nhistory of Laura's adventures since he had seen her; and, where she was\ndeficient in facts, supplied the blank by conjecture. With emotion\nindescribable, he listened to a coarse account of Miss Montreville's\nwants and labours. 'How could you suffer all this?' cried he,\nindignantly, when he was able to speak. 'Times are hard, Sir,' returned\nMrs Stubbs, the jolly purple deepening in her cheeks. 'Besides, Miss\nMontreville had always such an air with her, that I could not for my\nvery heart have asked her to take pot-luck with us.'\n\nThe colour faded from De Courcy's face as Mrs Stubbs proceeded to relate\nthe constant visits of Hargrave. 'I'll warrant,' said she, growing\nfamiliar as she perceived that she excited interest, 'I'll warrant he\ndid not come here so often for nothing. People must have ears, and use\nthem too; and I heard him myself swearing to her one day, that he loved\nher better than his life, or something to that purpose; and that, if she\nwould live with him, he would make her dreams pleasant, or some such\nstuff as that; and now, as sure as can be, she has taken him at his\nword, and gone to him.'\n\n'Peace, woman!' cried De Courcy, in a tone which he had never used to\nany of the sex, 'how dare you--?'\n\nMrs Stubbs, who had all that want of nerve which characterizes vulgar\narrogance, instantly shrunk into her shell. 'No offence, Sir,' said she.\n'It's all mere guess-work with me; only she does not know a creature in\nLondon, and she had nothing to carry her out of it; for she had just\nseven shillings in her pocket. I gave her seventeen and sixpence of\nchange this morning, and she gave half-a-guinea of that to the\nkitchen-maid. Now it stands to reason, she would not have been so ready\nparting with her money if she had not known where more was to be had.'\n\nDe Courcy, shocked and disgusted, turned from her in displeasure; and\nfinding that nothing was to be learnt from her of the place of Laura's\nretreat, betook himself to the print-shop, where he remembered that he\nhad first procured Miss Montreville's address. Mr Wilkins declared his\nignorance on the subject of Montague's inquiries; but, seeing the look\nof disappointment with which De Courcy was leaving the shop,\ngood-naturedly said, 'I dare say, Sir, if you wish to find out where\nMiss Montreville lives, I could let you know by asking Colonel Hargrave.\nHe comes here sometimes to look at the caricatures. And,' added Mr\nWilkins, winking significantly, 'I am mistaken if they are not very well\nacquainted.'\n\nDe Courcy's heart rose to his mouth. 'Perhaps so,' said he, scarcely\nconscious of what he said. 'There was a famous scene between them here\nabout three weeks ago,' proceeded the print-seller, anxious to justify\nhis own sagacity. 'I suppose they had not met for a while, and there\nsuch a kissing and embracing'--''Tis false!' cried De Courcy, lightning\nflashing from his eyes, 'Miss Montreville would have brooked such\nindignities from no man on earth.' 'Nay,' said Wilkins, shrugging up his\nshoulders, 'the shop-lads saw it as well as I--she fainted away in his\narms, and he carried her into the back-room there, and would not suffer\none of us to come near her; and Mr Finch there saw him down on his knees\nto her.' 'Cease your vile slanders,' cried De Courcy, half-distracted\nwith grief and indignation, 'I abhor--I despise them. But at your peril\ndare to breathe them into any other ear.' So saying, he darted from the\nshop, and returned to his hotel, infinitely more wretched than ever he\nhad been.\n\nThe happy dream was dispelled that painted him the master of Laura's\naffections. Another possessed her love; and how visible, how\nindelicately glaring, must be the preference that was apparent to every\nvulgar eye! But, bitter as was his disappointment, and cruel the pangs\nof jealousy, they were ease compared to the torture with which he\nadmitted a thought derogatory to Laura's worth. A thousand times he\nreproached himself for suffering the hints and conjectures of a lowbred\nwoman to affect his mind;--a thousand times assured himself, that no\npoverty, no difficulties, would overpower the integrity of Laura. 'Yet\nHargrave is a libertine,' said he, 'and if she can love a libertine,\nhow have I been deceived in her! No! it cannot be!--She is all\ntruth--all purity. It is she that is deceived. He has imposed upon her\nby a false show of virtue, and misery awaits her detection of his\ndeceit. She gone to him! I will never believe it. Libertine as he is, he\ndared not but to think of it. Extremity of want--lingering famine would\nnot degrade her to this,'--and tears filled De Courcy's manly eyes at\nthe thought that Laura was indeed in want.\n\nHe had no direct means of supplying her necessities; but he hoped that\nshe might inquire at her former abode for any letters that might chance\nto be left for her, and that she might thus receive any packet which he\naddressed to her. 'She shall never be humbled,' said he with a heavy\nsigh, 'by knowing that she owes this trifle to an indifferent, forgotten\nstranger;' and inclosing fifty pounds in a blank cover, he put both into\nan envelope to Mrs Stubbs, in which he informed her, that if she could\nfind no means of conveying the packet to Miss Montreville, the anonymous\nwriter would claim it again at some future time, on describing its\ncontents.\n\nBefore dispatching the letter, however, he resolved on making an attempt\nto discover whether Hargrave was acquainted with Laura's retreat. He\nshrunk from meeting his rival. His blood ran cold as he pictured to his\nfancy the exulting voice, the triumphant glance which would announce the\nmaster of Laura's fate. But any thing was preferable to his present\nsuspense; and the hope that he might yet be useful to Laura, formed an\nincitement still more powerful. 'Let me but find her,' said he, 'and I\nwill yet wrest her from destruction. If she is deceived I will warn; if\nshe is oppressed, I will protect her.'\n\nHe imagined that he should probably find Hargrave at the house of his\nuncle Lord Lincourt, and hastened thither to seek him; but found the\nhouse occupied only by servants, who were ignorant of the Colonel's\naddress. De Courcy knew none of Hargrave's places of resort. The habits\nand acquaintance of each lay in a different line. No means therefore of\ndiscovering him occurred to Montague, except that of inquiring at the\nhouse of Mrs Stubbs, where he thought it probable that the place of\nHargrave's residence might be known. Thither, then, he next bent his\ncourse.\n\nThe door was opened to him by Fanny; who replied to his questions, that\nnone of the family knew where Colonel Hargrave lived, and lamented that\nDe Courcy had not come a little earlier, saying that the Colonel had\nbeen gone not above a quarter of an hour. De Courcy was turning\ndisappointed away; when Fanny, stopping him, said with a courtesy and a\nhalf-whisper, 'Sir, an't please you, my mistress was all wrong about\nMiss Montreville, for the Colonel knows no more about her than I do.'\n'Indeed!' said De Courcy, all attention. 'Yes indeed Sir--when I told\nhim she was away, he was quite amazed, and in such a passion! So then I\nthought I would give him the letter.--' 'What letter?' cried De Courcy,\nthe glow of animation fading in his face. 'A letter that Miss\nMontreville left for him, Sir, but when he got it he was ten times\nangrier than before, and swore at her for not letting him know where she\nwas going. So I thought, Sir, I would make bold to tell you, Sir, as\nMistress had been speaking her mind, Sir; for it's a sad thing to have\none's character taken away; and Miss Montreville, I am sure, wouldn't do\nhurt to nobody.'\n\n'You are a good girl, a very good girl,' said De Courcy, giving her,\nwith a guinea, a very hearty squeeze of the hand. He made her repeat the\nparticulars of Hargrave's violent behaviour; and satisfied from them\nthat his rival had no share in Laura's disappearance, he returned to his\nhotel, his heart lightened of half the heaviest load that ever it had\nborne.\n\nStill, however, enough remained to exclude for a time all quiet from his\nbreast. He could not doubt that Laura's affections were Hargrave's. She\nhad given proof of it palpable to the most common observer; and\nresentment mingled with his grief while he thought, that to his fervent\nrespectful love, she preferred the undistinguishing passion of a\nlibertine. 'All women are alike,' said he, 'the slaves of mere outward\nshow:'--An observation for which the world was probably first indebted\nto circumstances somewhat like De Courcy's.\n\nRestless and uncomfortable, without any hope of finding Laura, he would\nnow have left London without an hour's delay. But, though he forgot his\nown fatigues, he was not unmindful of those of the grey-haired domestic\nwho attended him. He therefore deferred his journey to the following\nmorning; and then set out on his return to Norwood, more depressed and\nwretched than he had quitted it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nAll was yet dark and still, when Laura, like some unearthly being, stood\nby the bed where Fanny slept. The light which she bore in her wasted\nhand, shewed faintly the majestic form, darkened by its mourning\ngarments; and shed a dreary gleam upon tearless eyes, and a face whence\nall the hues of life were fled. She made a sign for Fanny to rise; and,\nawe-struck by the calm of unutterable grief, Fanny arose, and in silence\nfollowed her. They entered the chamber of death. With noiseless steps\nLaura approached the body, and softly drew back the covering. She\nbeckoned Fanny towards her. The girl comprehended that her aid was\nwanted in performing the last duties to Montreville; and, shrinking with\nsuperstitious fear, said, in a low tremulous whisper, 'I dare not touch\nthe dead.' Laura answered not; but raising her eyes to Heaven, as if\nthere to seek assistance in her mournful task, she gently pressed her\nhand upon the half-closed eyes that had so often beamed fondness on her.\nUnaided, and in silence, she did the last offices of love. She shed no\ntears. She uttered no lamentation. The dread stillness was broken only\nby the groans that burst at times from her heavy heart, and the more\ncontinued sobs of her attendant, who vented in tears her fear, her pity,\nand her admiration.\n\nWhen the sad task was finished, Laura, still speechless, motioned to the\nservant to retire. In horror at the thoughts of leaving Laura alone with\nthe dead, yet fearing to raise her voice, the girl respectfully grasped\nher mistress's gown, and, in a low but earnest whisper, besought her to\nleave this dismal place, and to go to her own chamber. Scarcely sensible\nof her meaning, Laura suffered her to draw her away; but when the door\nclosed upon all that remained of her father, she shuddered convulsively,\nand struggled to return. Fanny, however, gathered courage to lead her\nto her own apartment. There she threw herself prostrate on the ground; a\nflood of tears came to relieve her oppressed heart, and her recovered\nutterance broke forth in an act of resignation. She continued for some\nhours to give vent to her sorrow--a sorrow unallayed by any less painful\nfeeling, save those of devotion. She had lost the affectionate guide of\nher youth, the fond parent, whose love for her had brought him untimely\nto the grave; and, in the anguish of the thought that she should watch\nhis smile and hear his voice no more, she scarcely remembered that he\nhad left her to want and loneliness.\n\nThe morning was far advanced, when her sorrows were broken in upon by\nher landlady, who came to ask her directions in regard to the funeral.\nLaura had been unable to bend her thoughts to the consideration of this\nsubject; and she answered only by her tears. In vain did Mrs Stubbs\nrepeat that 'it was folly to take on so,'--'that we must all die;' 'and\nthat as every thing has two handles, Laura might comfort herself that\nshe should now have but one mouth to feed.' Laura seemed obstinate in\nher grief, and at last Mrs Stubbs declared that whether she would hear\nreason or not, something must without delay be settled about the\nfuneral; as for her part she could not order things without knowing how\nthey were to be paid for. Laura, putting her hand to her forehead,\ncomplained that her head felt confused, and, mildly begging her\npersecutor to have a little patience with her, promised, if she might be\nleft alone for the present, to return to the conversation in half an\nhour.\n\nAccordingly, soon after the time appointed, the landlady was surprised\nto see Laura enter the parlour, her cheek indeed colourless and her eyes\nswelled with weeping, but her manner perfectly calm and collected. 'Here\nare my father's watch and seals,' said she, presenting them. 'They may\nbe disposed of. That cannot wound him now,'--and she turned away her\nhead, and drew her hand across her eyes. 'Have the goodness to order\nwhat is necessary, for I am a stranger, without any friend.' Mrs Stubbs,\nexamining the watch, declared her opinion that the sale of it would\nproduce very little. 'Let every thing be plain, but decent,' said Laura,\n'and when I am able I will work day and night till all is paid.' 'I\ndoubt, Miss,' answered Mrs Stubbs, 'it will be long before your work\nwill pay for much; besides you will be in my debt for a week's\nlodgings--we always charge a week extra when there is a death in the\nhouse.' 'Tell me what you would have me to do, and I will do it,' said\nthe unfortunate Laura, wholly unable to contend with her hard-hearted\ncompanion. 'Why, Miss,' said Mrs Stubbs, 'there is your beautiful\nrose-wood work-table and the foot-stools, and your fine ivory work-box\nthat Mr De Courcy sent here before you came; if you choose to dispose of\nthem, I will take them off your hands.' 'Take them,' said Laura, 'I knew\nnot that they were mine.' Mrs Stubbs then conscientiously offered to\ngive a fourth part of the sum which these toys had cost De Courcy three\nmonths before, an offer which Laura instantly accepted; and the landlady\nhaving settled this business much to her own satisfaction, cheerfully\nundertook to arrange the obsequies of poor Montreville.\n\nThough the tragical scenes of the night had left Laura no leisure to\ndwell upon her fears for Hargrave, it was not without thankfulness that\nshe heard of his safety and restored composure. Her mind was at first\ntoo much occupied by her recent loss, to attempt accounting for his\nextravagant behaviour; and, after the first paroxysms of her sorrow were\npast, she retained but an imperfect recollection of his late\nconversation with her. She merely remembered his seeming distraction and\nthreatened suicide; and only bewildered herself by her endeavours to\nunravel his mysterious conduct. Sometimes a suspicion not very remote\nfrom truth would dart into her mind; but she quickly banished it, as an\ninstance of the causeless fears that are apt to infest the hearts of the\nunfortunate.\n\nAn innate delicacy which, in some degree, supplied to Laura the want of\nexperience, made her feel an impropriety in the daily visits which she\nwas informed that Hargrave made at her lodgings. She was aware that they\nmight be liable to misrepresentation, even though she should persist in\nher refusal to see him; and this consideration appeared to add to the\nnecessity already so urgent, for resolving on some immediate plan for\nher future course of life. But the future offered to Laura no attractive\nprospect. Wherever she turned, all seemed dark and unpromising. She\nfeared not to labour for her subsistence; no narrow pride forbade her\nuse of any honourable means of independence. But her personal charms\nwere such as no degree of humility could screen from the knowledge of\ntheir possessor, and she was sensible how much this dangerous\ndistinction increased the disqualifications of her sex and age for the\ncharacter of an artist. As an artist, she must be exposed to the\nintrusion of strangers, to public observation if successful; to unpitied\nneglect if she failed in her attempt. Besides, it was impossible to\nthink of living alone and unprotected, in the human chaos that\nsurrounded her. All her father's dismal forebodings rose to her\nremembrance; and she almost regarded herself as one who would be noticed\nonly as a mark for destruction, beguiled by frauds which no vigilance\ncould detect, overwhelmed by power which she could neither resist nor\nescape.\n\nShould she seek in solitude a refuge from the destroyer, and return to\nmourn at her deserted Glenalbert, the stroke that had left it like her\nlonely and forlorn, want lurked amidst its shades; for with her father\nhad died not only the duties and the joys of life, but even the means of\nits support. Her temporary right to the few acres which Montreville\nfarmed, was in less than a year to expire; and she knew that, after\ndischarging the claim of the landlord, together with some debts which\nthe long illness of Lady Harriet and the ill-fated journey had obliged\nMontreville to contract, little would remain from the sale of her\neffects at Glenalbert.\n\nLaura was sure, that the benevolent friend of her youth, the excellent\nMrs Douglas, would receive her with open arms--guide her inexperience\nwith a mother's counsel--comfort her sorrows with a mother's love. But\nher spirit revolted from a life of indolent dependence, and her sense of\njustice from casting a useless burden upon an income too confined to\nanswer claims stronger and more natural than hers. Mrs Douglas was\nherself the preceptress of her children, and both by nature and\neducation amply qualified for the momentous task. In domestic\nmanagement, her skill and activity were unrivalled. Laura, therefore,\nsaw no possibility of repaying, by her usefulness in any department of\nthe family, the protection which she might receive; and she determined\nthat nothing but the last necessity should induce her to tax the\ngenerosity of her friend, or to forego the honourable independence of\nthose who, though 'silver or gold they have none,' can barter for the\ncomforts they enjoy their mental treasures or their bodily toil.\n\nTo undertake the tuition of youth occurred to her as the most eligible\nmeans of procuring necessary subsistence, and protection, more necessary\nstill. It appeared to her that, as a member of any reputable family, she\nshould be sheltered from the dangers which her father had most taught\nher to dread. She reviewed her accomplishments, and impartially examined\nher ability to communicate them with temper and perseverance. Though for\nthe most part attained with great accuracy, they were few in number, and\nunobtrusive in kind. She read aloud with uncommon harmony and grace. She\nspoke and wrote with fluency and precision. She was grammatically\nacquainted with the French and Latin languages, and an adept in the\ncommon rules of arithmetic. Her proficiency in painting has been already\nnoticed; and she sang with inimitable sweetness and expression.\n\nBut though expert in every description of plain needle-work, she was an\nutter novice in the manufacture of all those elegant nothings, which are\nso serviceable to fine ladies in their warfare against time. Though she\nmoved with unstudied dignity and peerless grace, we are obliged to\nconfess, that the seclusion of her native village had doomed her to\nignorance of the art of dancing, that she had never entered a ball-room\nless capacious than the horizon, nor performed with a partner more\nillustrious than the schoolmaster's daughter. Her knowledge of music,\ntoo, was extremely limited. Lady Harriet had indeed tried to teach her\nto play on the piano-forte; but the attempt, after costing Laura many a\nfull heart, and many a watery eye, was relinquished as vain. Though the\nchild learnt with unusual facility whatever was taught her by her father\nor Mrs Douglas, and though she was already remarkable for the sweetness\nwith which she warbled her woodnotes wild, she no sooner approached the\npiano-forte, than an invincible stupidity seemed to seize on all her\nfaculties. This was the more mortifying, as it was the only one of her\nladyship's accomplishments which she ever personally attempted to\ncommunicate to her daughter. Lady Harriet was astonished at her failure.\nIt could proceed, she thought, from nothing but obstinacy. But the\nappropriate remedy for obstinacy, only aggravated the symptoms, and,\nafter all, Laura was indebted to Colonel Hargrave's tuition for so much\nskill as enabled her to accompany her own singing.\n\nLaura had more than once felt her deficiency in these fashionable arts,\non seeing them exhibited by young ladies, who, to use their own\nexpression, had returned from _finishing themselves_ at a\nboarding-school, and she feared that this blank in her education might\nprove a fatal bar to her being employed as a governess. But another and\na greater obstacle lay before her--she was utterly unknown. The only\npatrons whose recommendation she could command, were distant and\nobscure; and what mother would trust the minds and the manners of her\nchildren to the formation of a stranger? She knew not the ostrich-like\ndaring of fashionable mothers. This latter objection seemed equally\nhostile to her being received in quality of companion by those who might\nbe inclined to exchange subsistence and protection for relief from\nsolitude; and Laura, almost despairing, knew not whither to turn her\neye.\n\nOne path indeed invited her steps, a path bright with visions of\nrapture, warm with the sunshine of love and pleasure; but the flaming\nsword of Heaven guarded the entrance; and as often as her thoughts\nreverted that way, the struggle was renewed which forces the choice from\nthe pleasing to the right. No frequency of return rendered this struggle\nless painful. Laura's prudence had slept, when a little vigilance might\nhave saved her many an after pang; and she had long paid, was still long\nto pay, the forfeit of neglecting that wisdom which would guard 'with\nall diligence' the first beginnings of even the most innocent passions.\nHad she curbed the infant-strength of an attachment which, though it\nfailed to warp her integrity, had so deeply wounded her peace, how had\nshe lessened the force of that temptation, which lured her from the\nrugged ascent, where want and difficulty were to be her companions;\nwhich enticed her to the flowery bowers of pleasure with the voice and\nwith the smile of Hargrave!\n\nYet Laura had resisted a bribe more powerful than any consideration\nmerely selfish could supply; and she blushed to harbour a thought of\nyielding to her own inclinations what she had refused to a parent's\nwants, to a parent's prayer. Her heart filled as she called to mind how\nwarmly Montreville had seconded the wishes of her lover, how resolutely\nshe had withstood his will; and it swelled even to bursting at the\nthought that the vow was now fatally made void, which promised, by every\nendearment of filial love, to atone for this first act of disobedience.\n'Dearest, kindest of friends,' she cried, 'I was inflexible to thy\nrequest--thy last request! and shall I now recede? now, when, perhaps,\nthou art permitted to behold and to approve my motive; perhaps permitted\nto watch me still--permitted with higher power to guard, with less\nerring wisdom to direct me! And, Thou, who, in matchless condescension,\nrefusest not to be called Father of the fatherless--Thou, who, in every\ndifficulty canst guide, from every danger canst protect thy children,\nlet, if Thou see it good, the Heavens, which are thy throne, be all my\ncovering, the earth, which is thy footstool, be all my bed; but suffer\nme not to wander from Thee, the only source of peace and joy, to seek\nthem in fountains unhallowed and forbidden.'\n\nReligious habits and sentiments were permanent inmates of Laura's\nbreast. They had been invited and cherished, till, like familiar\nfriends, they came unsolicited; and, like friends, too, their visits\nwere most frequent in adversity. But the more ardent emotions of piety,\nare, alas! transient guests with us all; and, sinking from the flight\nwhich raised her for a time above the sorrows and the wants of earth,\nLaura was again forced to shrink from the gaunt aspect of poverty, again\nto turn a wistful eye towards a haven of rest on this side the grave.\n\nYoung as she was, however, she had long been a vigilant observer of her\nown actions, and of their consequences; and the result was an immutable\nconviction, that no heartfelt comfort could, in any circumstances,\nharbour with wilful transgression. As wilful transgression, she\nconsidered her marriage with a man whose principles she had fatal reason\nto distrust. As a rash defiance of unknown danger; as a desperate daring\nof temptations whose force was yet untried, as a desertion of those arms\nby which alone she could hope for victory in her Christian combat, Laura\nconsidered the hazardous enterprize which, trusting to the reformation\nof a libertine, would expose her to his example and his authority, his\nprovocations and his associates. Again she solemnly renewed her\nresolution never, by wilfully braving temptation, to forego the\nprotection of Him who can dash the fulness of worldly prosperity with\nsecret bitterness, or gladden with joys unspeakable the dwelling visited\nby no friend but Him, cheered by no comfort save the light of his\ncountenance.\n\nHargrave's letter served rather to fortify the resolution which it was\nintended to shake; for Laura was not insensible to the indelicacy which\ndid not scorn to owe to her necessities a consent which he had in vain\ntried to extort from her affection. Though pleased with his liberality,\nshe was hurt by his supposing that she could have so far forgotten the\nmortal offence which he had offered her, as to become his debtor for any\npecuniary favour; and, as nothing could be further from her intention\nthan to owe any obligation to Colonel Hargrave, she did not hesitate a\nmoment to return the money. When she had sealed the card in which she\ninclosed it, she again returned to the contemplation of her dreary\nprospects; and half hopelessly examined the possibilities of\nsubsistence. To offer instruction to the young, or amusement to the old,\nin exchange for an asylum from want and danger, still appeared to her\nthe most eligible plan of life; and again she weighed the difficulty of\nprocuring the necessary recommendations.\n\nLady Pelham occurred to her. Some claim she thought she might have had\nto the patronage of so near a relation. But who should identify her? who\nshould satisfy Lady Pelham that the claim of relationship did indeed\nbelong to Laura? Had she been previously known to her aunt, her\ndifficulties would have been at an end; now she would probably be\nrejected as an impostor; and she gave a sigh to the want of foresight\nwhich had suffered her to rejoice in escaping an interview with Lady\nPelham.\n\nAfter much consideration, she determined to solicit the recommendations\nof Mrs Douglas and the De Courcy family; and, until she could avail\nherself of these, to subsist, in some obscure lodging, by the labour of\nher hands. In the meantime, it was necessary to remove immediately from\nher present abode. The day following was the last when she could claim\nany right to remain there; and she proceeded to make preparations for\nher departure.\n\nWith a bleeding heart she began to arrange whatever had belonged to\nMontreville; and paused, with floods of tears, upon every relic now\nbecome so sacred. She entered his closet. His was the last foot that had\npressed the threshold. His chair stood as he had risen from it. On the\nground lay the cushion yet impressed with his knees--his Bible was open\nas he had left it. One passage was blistered with his tears; and there\nLaura read with emotions unutterable--'Leave to me thy fatherless\nchildren, and I will preserve them alive.' Her recent wounds thus torn\nopen, with agony which could not be restrained, she threw herself upon\nthe ground; and, with cries of anguish, besought her father to return\nbut for one short hour to comfort his desolate child. 'Oh I shall never,\nnever see him more,' said she,--'all my cries are vain,'--and she wept\nthe more because they were in vain. Soon, however, she reproached\nherself with her immoderate sorrow, soon mingled its accents with those\nof humble resignation; and the vigorous mind recovering in devotion all\nits virtuous energy, she returned, with restored composure, to her\nmelancholy labours.\n\nIn her father's writing desk she found an unfinished letter. It began\n'My dear De Courcy,'--and Laura was going to read it with the awe of one\nwho listens to the last words of a father, when she remembered having\nsurprised her father while writing it, and his having hastily concealed\nit from her sight. She instantly folded it without further acquaintance\nwith its contents, except that her own name caught her eye. Continuing\nto arrange the papers, she observed a letter addressed to herself in a\nhand which she did not remember to have seen. It was Lady Pelham's\nanswer to that in which Laura had announced her mother's death. She\nperceived that it might furnish an introduction to her aunt; and with a\nsensation of gratitude she remembered that she had been accidentally\nprevented from destroying it.\n\nLady Pelham was elder by several years than her sister Lady Harriet. Her\nfather, a saving painstaking attorney, died a few months after she was\nborn. His widow, who, from an idea of their necessity, had concurred in\nall his economical plans, discovered with equal surprise and delight,\nthat his death had left her the entire management of five-and-forty\nthousand pounds. This fortune, which she was to enjoy during her life,\nwas secured, in the event of her demise, to little Miss Bridget; and\nthis arrangement was one of the earliest pieces of information which\nlittle Miss Bridget received. For seven years the little heiress was, in\nher mother's undisguised opinion, and consequently in her own, the most\nimportant personage upon the face of this terrestrial globe. But worldly\nglories are fleeting. Lord Winterfield's taste in stewed carp had been\nimproved by half a century's assiduous cultivation. Now the widow Price\nunderstood the stewing of carp better than any woman in England, so his\nLordship secured to himself the benefit of her talent by making her Lady\nWinterfield. In ten months after her marriage, another young lady\nappeared, as much more important than Miss Bridget, as an earl is than\nan attorney. Fortune, however, dispensed her gifts with tolerable\nequality. Beauty and rank, indeed, were all on the side of Lady Harriet,\nbut the wealth lay in the scale of Miss Price; for Lord Winterfield,\nleaving the bulk of his property to the children of his first marriage,\nbequeathed to his youngest daughter only five thousand pounds. These\ncircumstances procured to Miss Price another advantage, for she married\na baronet with a considerable estate, while Lady Harriet's fate stooped\nto a lieutenant in a marching regiment. After ten years, which Lady\nPelham declared were spent in uninterrupted harmony, Sir Edward Pelham\ndied. The exclusive property of his wife's patrimony had been strictly\nsecured to her; and, either thinking such a provision sufficient for a\nfemale, or moved by a reason which we shall not at present disclose, Sir\nEdward bestowed on the nephew who inherited his title, his whole estate,\nburthened only with a jointure of five hundred pounds a-year, settled\nupon Lady Pelham by her marriage-contract. Of his daughter, and only\nchild, no mention was made in his testament; but Sir Edward, during the\nlast years of his life, had acquired the character of an oddity, and\nnobody wondered at his eccentricities. At the commencement of her\nwidowhood, Lady Pelham purchased a villa in ----shire, where she spent\nthe summer, returning in the winter to Grosvenor Street; and this last\nwas almost the only part of her history which was known to Laura. Even\nbefore Lady Harriet's marriage, little cordiality had existed between\nthe sisters. From the date of that event, their intercourse had been\nalmost entirely broken off; and the only attention which Laura had ever\nreceived from her aunt, was contained in the letter which she was now\nthankfully contemplating. Her possession of this letter, together with\nher acquaintance with the facts to which it related, she imagined would\nform sufficient proof of her identity; and her national ideas of the\nclaims of relationship, awakened a hope of obtaining her aunt's\nassistance in procuring some respectable situation.\n\nDetermined to avail herself of her fortunate discovery, she quitted her\nfather's apartments; and, carrying with her her credential, lost no time\nin repairing to Grosvenor Street. Nor did she experience the reluctance\nwhich she had formerly felt towards an interview with Lady Pelham; for\nshe was fully sensible of the difference between a petitioner for\ncharity and a candidate for honourable employment. Besides, there is no\nteacher of humility like misfortune; and Laura's spirits were too\ncompletely subdued to anticipate or to notice diminutive attacks upon\nher self-consequence. She still, however, with constitutional reserve,\nshrunk from intruding upon a stranger; and she passed and repassed the\ndoor, examining the exterior of the house, as if she could thence have\ninferred the character of its owner, before she took courage to give one\ngentle knock.\n\nA footman opened the door, and Laura, faltering, inquired if Lady Pelham\nwas within. From Laura's single knock, her humble voice, and her yet\nmore humble habit, which, in ten month's use, had somewhat faded from\nthe sober magnificence of black, the man had formed no very lofty idea\nof the visitor's rank. He answered, that he believed his lady was not at\nhome; but half-afraid of dismissing some person with whom she might have\nbusiness, he spoke in a tone which made Laura a little doubt the truth\nof his information. She inquired at what time she might be likely to\ngain access to Lady Pelham; and, as she spoke, threw back her cape veil,\nunconscious how successfully she was pleading her own cause. Struck with\na countenance whose candour, sweetness, and beauty, won a way to every\nheart, the man gazed at her for a moment with vulgar admiration, and\nthen throwing open the door of a little parlour, begged her to walk in,\nwhile he inquired whether his lady were visible. He soon returned,\ntelling Laura that Lady Pelham would receive her in a few minutes.\n\nDuring these few minutes, Laura had formed a hundred conjectures\nconcerning her aunt's person, voice, and manner. She wondered whether\nshe resembled Lady Harriet; whether her own form would recal to Lady\nPelham the remembrance of her sister. At every noise her heart\nfluttered--at every step she expected the entrance of this relation, on\nwhom perhaps so much of her future fate might depend; and she held her\nbreath that she might distinguish her approach. A servant at last came\nto conduct her to his mistress; and she followed him, not without a\nfeeling of awe, into the presence of her mother's sister.\n\nThat sentiment, however, by no means gathered strength when she took\ncourage to raise her eyes to the plain little elderly person to whom she\nwas introduced, and heard herself addressed in the accents of cheerful\nfamiliarity. Laura, with modest dignity, made known her name and\nsituation. She spoke of her mother's death, and the tears trickled from\nher eyes--of her father's, and in venting the natural eloquence of\ngrief, she forgot that she came to interest a stranger. Lady Pelham\nseemed affected; she held her handkerchief to her eyes, and remained in\nthat attitude for some time after Laura had recovered self-possession.\nThen, throwing her arms round her lovely niece, she affectionately\nacknowledged the relationship, adding, 'Your resemblance to my poor\nsister cannot be overlooked, and yet in saying so, I am far from paying\nyou a compliment.'\n\nAfter shewing Lady Pelham her own letter, and mentioning such\ncircumstances as tended to confirm her identity, Laura proceeded to\ndetail her plans, to which her Ladyship listened with apparent interest.\nShe inquired into Laura's accomplishments, and seemed pondering the\nprobability of employing them with advantage to the possessor. After a\nfew moments silence, she said, 'That short as their acquaintance had\nbeen, she thought she could perceive that Laura had too much sensibility\nfor a dependent situation. But we shall talk of that hereafter,'\ncontinued she. 'At present, your spirits are too weak for the society of\nstrangers;--and mine,' added her Ladyship, with a sigh, 'are not much\nmore buoyant than your own.' Laura looked up with the kindly interest\nwhich, whether she herself were joyful or in sadness, sorrow could\nalways command with her; and her aunt answered her glance of inquiry, by\nrelating, that her only daughter and heiress, had eloped from her a few\ndays before, with an artful young fellow without family or fortune. 'She\ndeceived me by a train of the basest artifices,' said Lady Pelham,\n'though she might have known that her happiness was my chief concern;\nand that, to secure it, I might have been brought to consent to any\nthing. Yet with the closest secrecy she misled--with the most unfeeling\ncoldness left me. Her disobedience I might have forgiven--her deceit I\nnever can; or, if as a Christian I forgive, I never, never can forget\nit.'\n\nLady Pelham had talked herself out of breath; and Laura, not quite\nunderstanding this kind of Christian forgiveness, was silent, because\nshe did not well know what to say. She felt, however, compassion for a\nparent, deserted by her only child, and the feeling was legible in a\ncountenance peculiarly fitted for every tender expression.\n\nThere are some degrees of sorrow which increase in acuteness, at least\nwhich augment in vehemence of expression, by the perception of having\nexcited sympathy. Weak fires gather strength from radiation. After a\nglance at Laura, Lady Pelham melted into tears, and continued, 'I know\nnot how I had deserved such treatment from her; for never had she reason\nto complain of me. I have always treated her with what I must call\nunmerited kindness.'\n\nLaura now ventured a few conciliating words. 'She will feel her error,\nMadam,--she will strive by her after-life to atone--' Lady Pelham\nimmediately dried her eyes, 'No, no, my dear,' interrupted she, 'you\ndon't know her--you have no idea of the hardness of her unfeeling heart.\nRejoice, sweet girl, that you have no idea of it. For my part, though\nsensibility is at best but a painful blessing, I would not exchange it\nfor the most peaceful apathy that can feel for nothing but itself. I\nmust have something to love and cherish. You shall be that something.\nYou shall live with me, and we shall console each other.'\n\nOn another occasion, Laura might have been disposed to canvass the\nnature of that sensibility which could thus enlarge to a stranger on the\ndefects of an only child. Indeed she was little conversant even with the\nname of this quality. Her own sensibility she had been taught to\nconsider as a weakness to be subdued, not as an ornament to be gloried\nin; and the expansion of soul which opens to all the sorrows and to all\nthe joys of others, she had learnt to call by a holier name--to regulate\nby a nobler principle. But she was little disposed to examine the merits\nof a feeling to which she owed the offer of an unsolicited asylum. Her\nheart swelling with gratitude, she clasped Lady Pelham's hand between\nher own, and while tears streamed down her face, 'Kind considerate\nfriend,' she cried, 'why, why were you not known to us while my father\ncould have been sensible to your kindness!'\n\nAfter Lady Pelham had repeated her proposal in more detail, and Laura\nhad thankfully acceded to it, they remained in conversation for some\ntime longer. Lady Pelham shewed that she had much wit, much vivacity,\nand some information; and, after settling that Laura should next day\nbecome an inmate in Grosvenor Street, they separated, mutually delighted\nwith each other. Lady Pelham applauded herself for a generous action,\nand, to the interest which Laura awakened in every breast, was added in\nLady Pelham's all the benevolence of self-complacency. Laura, on the\nother hand, did not dream that any fault could harbour in the\nunsuspicious liberal heart which had believed the tale, and removed the\ndifficulties of a stranger. She did not once dream that she owed her new\nasylum to any motives less noble than disinterested goodness.\n\nNo wonder that her Ladyship's motive escaped the penetration of Laura,\nwhen it even evaded her own. And yet no principle could be more simple\nin its nature, or more constant in its operation, than that which\ninfluenced Lady Pelham; but the Proteus put on so many various forms,\nthat he ever evaded detection from the subject of his sway. In the\nmeantime, the desire of performing a generous action--of securing the\ngratitude of a feeling heart--of patronizing a poor relation, were the\nonly motives which her Ladyship acknowledged to herself, when she\noffered protection to Laura. An idea had, indeed, darted across her\nright honourable mind, that she might now secure a humble companion at a\nrate lower than the usual price of such conveniences: a momentary\nnotion, too, she formed of exciting the jealousy of her daughter, by\nreplacing her with so formidable a competitor for favour; but these, she\nthought, were mere collateral advantages, and by no means the\ncircumstances which fixed her determination. The resolution upon which\nshe acted, was taken, as her resolutions generally were, without\ncaution; and she expressed it, as her custom was, the moment it was\nformed. Laura was scarcely gone, however, when her aunt began to repent\nof her precipitancy, and to wish, as she had often occasion to do, that\nshe had taken a little more time for consideration. But she comforted\nherself, that she could at any time get rid of her charge, by\nrecommending Laura to one of the situations which she had mentioned as\nher choice; and the lady knew it would not be difficult to find one more\nlucrative than that upon which her niece was entering; for how could she\npossibly offer wages to so near a relation, or insult with the gift of\na trifling sum a person of Laura's dignity of deportment? These reasons,\nLady Pelham alleged to herself, as sufficient grounds for a resolution\nnever to affront her niece by a tender of pecuniary favours.\n\nWhile these thoughts were revolving in Lady Pelham's mind, Laura had\nreached her home; and, on her knees, was thanking Providence for having\nraised up for her a protector and a friend, and praying that she might\nbe enabled to repay, in affectionate and respectful duty, a part of the\ndebt of gratitude which she owed to her benefactress. The rest of the\nevening she spent in preparing for her removal--in ruminating on her\ninterview with her aunt, and in endeavouring to compose, from the scanty\nmaterials which she possessed, a character of this new arbitress of her\ndestiny. From Lady Pelham's prompt decision in favour of a stranger,\nfrom her unreserved expression of her feelings, from her lively manner\nand animated countenance, Laura concluded that she was probably of a\nwarm temper, susceptible, and easily wounded by unkindness or neglect,\nbut frank, candid, and forgiving. Laura wished that she had better\nstudied her aunt's physiognomy. What she recollected of it was quite\nunintelligible to her. She laboured in vain to reconcile the feminine\ncurvatures of the nose and forehead with the inflexible closing of the\nmouth, and the hard outline of the chin, where lurked no soft relenting\nline.\n\nBut however the countenance might puzzle conjecture, of the mind she\nharboured not a doubt; Lady Pelham's, she was persuaded, was one of\nthose open generous souls, which the young and unwary are always\nprepared to expect and to love--souls having no disguise, and needing\nnone. Now this was precisely the character which Lady Pelham often and\nsincerely drew of herself: and who ought to have been so intimately\nacquainted with her Ladyship's dispositions?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nIt was not without hesitation that Laura formed her resolution to\nconceal from Hargrave her place of abode. She felt for the uneasiness\nwhich this concealment would cause him. She feared that her desertion\nmight remove one incitement to a virtuous course. But she considered,\nthat while their future connection was doubtful, it was imprudent to\nstrengthen by habitual intercourse their need of each other's society;\nand she reflected, that she could best estimate his character from\nactions performed beyond the sphere of her influence. Her watchful\nself-distrust made her fear to expose her resolution to his\nimportunities; and she felt the impropriety of introducing into her\naunt's family, a person who stood on terms with her which she did not\nchoose to explain. These reasons induced her to withhold from Hargrave\nthe knowledge of her new situation; and, certain that if it were known\nto Mrs Stubbs or her servants he would soon be master of the secret, she\nleft no clue by which to trace her retreat. Perhaps, though she did not\nconfess it to herself, she was assisted in this act of self-command by a\nlatent hope, that as she was now to be introduced to a society on his\nown level, Hargrave might not find the mystery quite inscrutable.\n\nShe was kindly welcomed by Lady Pelham, and took possession of a small\nbut commodious apartment, where she arranged her drawing-materials,\ntogether with the few books she possessed, intending to make that her\nretreat as often as her aunt found amusement or occupation independent\nof her. She resolved to devote her chief attention to making herself\nuseful and entertaining to her patroness. In the first, she derived\nhopes of success, from Lady Pelham's declared incapacity for all\nemployments that are strictly feminine. The second, she thought, would\nbe at once easy and pleasant, for Lady Pelham was acute, lively, and\ncommunicative. This latter quality she possessed in an unusual degree,\nand yet Laura found it difficult to unravel her character. In general,\nshe saw that her aunt's understanding was bright; she was persuaded that\nin general her heart was warm and generous; but the descent to\nparticulars baffled Laura's penetration. Lady Pelham could amuse--could\ndelight; she said many wise, and many brilliant things; but her wisdom\nwas not always well-timed, and her brilliant things were soap-bubbles in\nthe sun, sparkling and highly coloured, but vanishing at the touch of\nhim who would examine their structure. Lady Pelham could dispute with\nsingular acuteness. By the use of ambiguous terms, by ingenious\nsophistry, by dexterously shifting from the ground of controversy, she\ncould baffle, and perplex, and confound her opponents: but she could not\nargue; she never convinced. Her opinions seemed fluctuating, and Laura\nwas sometimes ready to imagine that she defended them, not because they\nwere just, nor even because they were her own, but merely because she\nhad called them so; for with a new antagonist she could change sides,\nand maintain the opposite ground with equal address.\n\nIn spite of all the warmth of heart for which she gave her heart credit,\nLaura soon began to imagine that Lady Pelham had no friends. Among all\nthe acquaintances whom she attracted and amused, no one seemed to\nexchange regard with her. The gaiety of pleasure never softened in her\npresence into the tenderness of affection. Laura could not discover that\nthere existed one being from whose failings Lady Pelham respectfully\naverted her own sight, while reverently veiling them from the eyes of\nothers. A few, a very few, seemed to be the objects of Lady Pelham's\nesteem; those of her love Laura could not discover. Towards her,\nhowever, her aunt expressed a strong affection; and Laura continued to\npersuade herself, that if Lady Pelham had no friends, it was because she\nwas surrounded by those who were not worthy of her friendship.\n\nAs she appeared to invite and to desire unreserved confidence, Laura had\nsoon made her acquainted with the narrative of her short life, excepting\nin so far as it related to Hargrave. At the detail of the unworthy\nadvantage which Warren had taken of Montreville's inability to enforce\nhis claim for the annuity, Lady Pelham broke out into sincere and\nvehement expressions of indignation and contempt; for no one more\ncordially abhorred oppression, or despised meanness in others. She\nimmediately gave directions to her man of business to attempt bringing\nthe affair to a conclusion, and even to threaten Warren with a\nprosecution in case of his refusal. Virtuous resistance of injustice was\nmotive sufficient for this action. Pity that Lady Pelham should have\nsought another in the economy and ease with which it promised to provide\nfor an indigent relative! Mr Warren was no sooner informed that the poor\nobscure unfriended Laura was the niece of Lady Pelham, and the inmate of\nher house, than he contrived to arrive at a marvellous certainty that\nthe price of the annuity had been paid, and that the mistake in the\npapers relating to it originated in mere accident. In less than a\nfortnight the informality was rectified, and the arrears of the annuity\npaid into Laura's hands; the lawyer having first, at Lady Pelham's\ndesire, deducted the price of his services.\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Laura surveyed her wealth, now of diminished\nvalue in her estimation. 'Only a few weeks ago,' said she, 'how precious\nhad this been to me.--But now!--Yet it is precious still,' said she, as\nshe wiped the tears away, 'for it can minister occasions of obedience\nand usefulness.' That very day she dispatched little presents for each\nof Mrs Douglas's children, in which use was more considered than show;\nand in the letter which announced her gifts, she inclosed half the\nremaining sum to be distributed among her own poor at Glenalbert. That\nher appearance might not discredit her hostess, she next proceeded to\nrenew her wardrobe; and though she carefully avoided unnecessary\nexpence, she consulted not only decency but elegance in her attire. In\nthis, and all other matters of mere indifference, Laura was chiefly\nguided by her aunt; for she had early observed that this lady, upon all\noccasions, small as well as great, loved to exercise the office of\ndictatrix. No person could have been better fitted than Laura to\nconciliate such a temper; for on all the lesser occasions of submissions\nshe was as gentle and complying as she was inflexible upon points of\nreal importance. In their conversations, too, though Laura defended her\nown opinions with great firmness, she so carefully avoided direct\ncontradiction or sarcastic retort, impatience in defeat, or triumph in\nvictory, that even Lady Pelham could scarcely find subject of irritation\nin so mild an antagonist. In some respects, their tempers seemed to\ntally admirably. Lady Pelham had great aptitude in detecting errors,\nLaura a genius for remedying them. Difficulty always roused her\nLadyship's impatience, but she found an infallible resource in the\nperseverance of Laura. In short, Laura contrived so many opportunities,\nor seized with such happy art those which presented themselves, of\nministering to the comfort or convenience of her aunt, that she became\nboth respectable and necessary to her; and this was, generally speaking,\nthe utmost extent of Lady Pelham's attachments.\n\nLady Pelham sometimes spoke of her daughter, and Laura never missed the\nopportunity of urging a reconciliation. She insisted that the rights of\nnatural affection were unalienable; that as they did not rest upon the\nmerits, so neither could they be destroyed by the unworthiness either of\nparents or of children. The mother answered, with great impatience, that\nLaura's argument was entirely founded on prejudice; that it was true\nthat for the helplessness of infancy, a peculiar feeling was provided;\nbut that in all animals this peculiar feeling ceased as soon as it was\nno longer essential to the existence of the individual. 'From\nthenceforth,' added she, 'the regard must be founded on the qualities of\nthe head and heart; and if my child is destitute of these, I can see no\nreason why I should prefer her to the child of any other woman.' 'Ah!'\nsaid Laura, tears of grateful recollection rushing down her cheek, 'some\nparents have loved their child with a fervour which no worth of hers\ncould merit.' The gush of natural sensibility for this time averted the\nrising storm; but the next time that Laura renewed her conciliatory\nefforts, Lady Pelham, growing more vehement as she became herself\nconvinced that she was in the wrong, burst into a paroxysm of rage; and,\nexecrating all rebellious children, and their defenders, commanded Laura\nin future to confine her attention to what might concern herself.\n\nThe humbling spectacle of a female face distorted with passion was not\nquite new to Laura. Undismayed, she viewed it with calm commiseration;\nand mildly expressing her sorrow for having given offence, took up her\nwork and left the ferment to subside at leisure. Her Ladyship's passion\nsoon cooled; and, making advances with a sort of surly condescension,\nshe entered on a new topic. Laura answered exactly as if nothing\ndisagreeable had happened; and Lady Pelham could not divine whether her\nniece commanded her countenance, or her temper. Upon one principle of\njudging the lady had grounds for her doubt; she herself had sometimes\ncommanded her countenance--her temper never.\n\nLaura not only habitually avoided giving or taking offence, but made it\na rule to extinguish its last traces by some act of cordiality and\ngood-will. This evening, therefore, she proposed, with a grace which\nseemed rather to petition a favour than to offer a service, to attempt\na portrait of her aunt. The offer was accepted with pleasure, and the\nportrait begun on the following day. It proved a likeness, and a\nfavourable one. Lady Pelham was kinder than ever. Laura avoided the\nprohibited subject, and all was quiet and serene. Lady Pelham at last\nherself reverted to it; for indeed she could not long forbear to speak\nupon any topic that roused her passions. No dread of personal\ninconvenience could deter Laura from an act of justice or mercy, and she\nagain steadily pronounced her opinion. But aware that one who would\npersuade must be careful not to irritate, she expressed her sentiments\nwith still more cautious gentleness than formerly; and perceiving that\nher aunt was far more governed by passion than by reason, she quitted\nargument for entreaty. By these means she avoided provoking hostility,\nthough she failed to win compliance. Lady Pelham seemed to be utterably\nimpenetrable to entreaty, or to take pride in resisting it, and Laura\nhad only to hope that time would favour her suit.\n\nLady Pelham mentioned an intention of moving early to the country, and\nLaura rejoiced in the prospect of once more beholding the open face of\nHeaven--of listening to nature's own music--of breathing the light air\nof spring. She longed to turn her ear from the discords of the city to\nthe sweet sounds of peace--her eye from countenances wan with care,\nflushed with intemperance, or ghastly with famine, to cheeks brown with\nwholesome exercise, or ruddy with health and contentment--to exchange\nthe sight of dusky brick walls, and walks overlooked by thousands, for\nthe sunny slope or the sheltered solitary lane. Lady Pelham took\npleasure in describing the beauties of Walbourne, and Laura listened to\nher with interest, anticipating eagerly the time when she should inhabit\nso lovely, so peaceful a scene. But that interest and eagerness rose to\nthe highest, when she accidentally discovered that the De Courcy family\nwere Lady Pelham's nearest neighbours in the country.\n\nThe want of something to love and cherish, which was with her Ladyship a\nmere form of speech, was with Laura a real necessity of nature; and\nthough it was one which almost every situation could supply, since every\ncreature that approached her was the object of her benevolence, yet much\nof the happiness of so domestic a being depended on the exercise of the\ndearer charities, and no one was more capable of a distinguishing\npreference than Laura. She had a hearty regard for the De Courcy family.\nShe revered Mrs De Courcy; she liked Harriet; and bestowed on Montague\nher cordial esteem and gratitude. This gratitude had now acquired a\nsacred tenderness; for it was associated in her mind with the\nremembrance of a parent. De Courcy's self-denial had cheered her\nfather's sick-bed, his benevolence gladdened her father's heart, and his\nself-denial appeared more venerable, his benevolence more endearing.\n\nHaving written to inform Harriet of the change in her situation, she\ndiscovered from her answer a new proof of De Courcy's friendship, in the\nfruitless journey which he had made to relieve her, and she regretted\nthat her caution had deprived her of an opportunity of seeing and\nthanking him for all his kindness. 'Yet, if we had met,' said she, 'I\nshould probably have acted as I have done a thousand times before; left\nhim to believe me an insensible, ungrateful creature, for want of\ncourage to tell him that I was not so.' She longed, however, to see De\nCourcy; for with him she thought she could talk of her father--to him\nlament her irreparable loss, dwell with him on the circumstances that\naggravated her sorrow--on the prospects which mingled that sorrow with\nhope. This was a subject on which she never entered with Lady Pelham any\nfarther than necessity required--real sorrow has its holy ground, on\nwhich no vulgar foot must tread. The self-command of Laura would have\nforbidden her, in any situation, to darken with a settled gloom the\nsunshine of domestic cheerfulness; but Lady Pelham had in her somewhat\nwhich repels the confidence of grief. Against all the arrows of\nmisfortune, blunted at least as they rebound from the breasts of others,\nshe seemed to 'wear a charmed life.' She often indeed talked of\nsensibility, and reprobated the want of it as the worst of faults; but\nthe only kind of it in which she indulged rather inclined to the\nacrimonious than the benevolent, and Laura began to perceive, that\nhowever her aunt might distinguish them in others, irascible passions\nand keen feelings were in herself synonymous.\n\nAfter the effort of giving and receiving the entertainment which Lady\nPelham constantly offered, and as constantly exacted in return, Laura\nexperienced a sensation of recovered freedom when the arrival of a\nvisitor permitted her to escape to her own apartment. She saw nobody but\nher aunt, and never went abroad except to church. Thus, during a\nfortnight which she had passed in Grosvenor Street she had heard nothing\nof Hargrave. She was anxious to know whether he visited Lady Pelham;\nfor, with rustic ignorance, she imagined that all people of condition\nwho resided in the same town must be known to each other; but she had\nnot courage to ask, and searched in vain for his name among the cards\nthat crowded the table in the lobby. Though she was conscious of some\ncuriosity to know how he employed the hours which her absence left\nvacant, she did not own to herself that she was at all concerned in a\nresolution which she took, to inquire in person whether any letters had\nbeen left for her with Mrs Stubbs. She did not choose to commit the\ninquiry to a servant, because she would not condescend to enjoin her\nmessenger to secrecy as to the place of her abode; and she continued\nresolved to give her lover no clue to discover it.\n\nAccordingly, she early one morning set out in a hackney-coach, which she\ntook the precaution to leave at some distance from her old lodgings,\nordering it to wait her return. Fanny was delighted to see her, and\ncharmed with the improvement of her dress, and the returning\nhealthfulness of her appearance; but the landlady eyed her askance, and\nsurlily answered to her inquiry for her letters, that she would bring\nthe only one she had got; muttering, as she went to fetch it, something\nof which the words 'secret doings' were all that reached Laura's ear.\n'There, Miss,' said the ungracious Mrs Stubbs, 'there's your letter, and\nthere's the queer scrawl it came wrapped up in.' 'Mr De Courcy's hand,'\ncried Laura surprised, but thinking, from its size, that some time would\nbe required to read it, she deferred breaking the seal till she should\nreturn to her carriage. 'I suppose you're mistaken, Miss,' said Mrs\nStubbs; 'Mr De Courcy was here twice the day it came, and he never said\na word of it.'\n\nLaura now tremulously inquired whether she might be permitted to visit\nher father's room; but being roughly answered that it was occupied, she\nquietly prepared to go. As Fanny followed her through the garden, to\nopen the gate for her, Laura, a conscious blush rising to her face,\ninquired whether any body else had inquired for her since her departure.\nFanny, who was ready to burst with the news of Hargrave's visit, and who\nwas just meditating how she might venture to introduce it, improved this\noccasion of entering on a full detail of his behaviour. With the true\nwaiting-maid-like fondness for romance, she enlarged upon all his\nextravagancies, peeping side-long now and then under Laura's bonnet, to\ncatch encouragement from the complacent simper with which such tales are\noften heard. But no smile repaid her eloquence. With immoveable\nseriousness did Laura listen to her, gravely revolving the strange\nnature of that love which could so readily amalgamate with rage and\njealousy, and every discordant passion. She was hurt at the indecorum\nwhich exposed these weaknesses to the observation of a servant; and\nwith a sigh reflected, that, to constitute the happiness of a woman of\nsense and spirit, a husband must be possessed of qualities respectable\nas well as amiable.\n\nFanny next tried, whether what concerned De Courcy might not awaken more\napparent interest; and here she had at least a better opportunity to\njudge of the effect of her narrative, for Laura stopped and turned full\ntowards her. But Fanny had now no transports to relate, except De\nCourcy's indignation of Mrs Stubbs' calumny; and it was not without\nhesitating, and qualifying, and apologizing, that the girl ventured to\nhint at the insinuation which her mistress had thrown out. She had at\nlast succeeded in raising emotion, for indignant crimson dyed Laura's\ncheeks, and fire flashed from her eyes. But Laura seldom spoke while she\nwas angry; and again she silently pursued her way. 'Pray, Madam,' said\nthe girl as she was opening the gate, 'do be so good as to tell me where\nyou live now, that nobody may speak ill of you before me?' 'I thank you,\nmy good girl,' returned Laura, a placid smile again playing on her\ncountenance; 'but my character is in no danger.--You were kind to us,\nFanny, when you knew that we could not reward you; accept of this from\nme;' and she put five guineas into her hand. 'No, indeed, Ma'am,' cried\nFanny, drawing back her hand and colouring; 'I was civil for pure good\nwill, and--.' Laura, whose sympathy with her inferiors was not confined\nto her bodily wants, fully understood the feeling that revolts from\nbartering for gold alone the service of the heart. 'I know it my dear,'\nanswered she, in an affectionate tone; 'and believe me, I only mean to\nacknowledge, not to repay, your kindness.' Fanny, however, persisted in\nher refusal, and Laura obliged her to leave her at the gate, where, with\ntears in her eyes, the girl stood gazing after her till she was out of\nsight. 'I'm sure,' said she, turning towards the house as Laura\ndisappeared, 'I'm sure she was made to be a queen, for the more one\nlikes her, the more she frightens one.'\n\nAs soon as Laura was seated in her carriage, she opened her packet, and\nwith momentary disappointment examined its contents. 'Not one line!' she\ncried in a tone of mortification; and then turned to the envelope\naddressed to Mrs Stubbs. Upon comparing this with the circumstances\nwhich she had lately heard, she at once comprehended De Courcy's\nintention of serving her by stealth, foregoing the credit due to his\ngenerosity. She wondered, indeed, that he had neglected to disguise his\nhand-writing in the superscription. 'Did he think,' said she, 'that I\ncould have forgotten the writing that has so often brought comfort to my\nfather?' She little guessed how distant from his mind was the repose\nwhich can attend to minute contrivance.\n\nDelighted to discover a trait of character which tallied so well with\nher preconceived opinion, she no sooner saw Lady Pelham than she related\nit to her aunt, and began a warm eulogium on De Courcy's temper and\ndispositions. Lady Pelham coldly cut her short, by saying, 'I believe Mr\nDe Courcy is a very good young man, but I am not very fond of prodigies.\nOne can't both wonder and like at a time; your men with two heads are\nalways either supposititious or disgusting.' This speech was one of the\ndampers which the warm heart abhors; real injury could not more\nsuccessfully chill affection or repress confidence. It had just malice\nand just truth enough to be provoking; and for the second time that day\nLaura had to strive with the risings of anger. She was upon the point of\nsaying, 'So, aware of the impossibility of being at once wonderful and\npleasing, your Ladyship, I suppose, aims at only one of these objects;'\nbut ere the sarcasm found utterance, she checked herself, and hastened\nout of the room, with the sensation of having escaped from danger. She\nretired to write to De Courcy a letter of grateful acknowledgment; in\nwhich, after having received Lady Pelham's approbation, she inclosed his\ngift, explaining the circumstances which now rendered it unnecessary.\n\nLady Pelham was not more favourable to the rest of the De Courcy family\nthan she had been to Montague. She owned, indeed, that Mrs De Courcy was\nthe best woman in the world, but a virtue, she said, so cased in armour,\nnecessarily precluded all grace or attraction. Harriet she characterized\nas a little sarcastic coquette. Laura, weary of being exposed to the\ndouble peril of weakly defending, or angrily supporting her attacked\nfriends, ceased to mention the De Courcys at all; though, with a\npardonable spirit of contradiction, she loved them the better for the\nunprovoked hostility of Lady Pelham. The less she talked of them, the\nmore she longed for the time when she might, unrestrained, exchange with\nthem testimonies of regard. The trees in the Park, as they burst into\nleaf, stimulated Laura's desire for the country; and while she felt the\ngenial air of spring, or listened to the early song of some luckless\nbird caged in a neighbouring window, or saw the yellow glories of the\ncrocus peeping from its unnatural sanctuary, she counted the days till\nher eyes should be gladdened with the joyous face of nature. Only a\nfortnight had now to pass before her wish was to be gratified, for Lady\nPelham intended at the end of that time to remove to Walbourne.\n\nLaura was just giving the finishing touches to her aunt's portrait when\na visitor was announced; and, very unwilling to break off at this\ninteresting crisis, Lady Pelham having first scolded the servant for\nletting in her friend, desired him to shew the lady into the room where\nLaura was at work. The usual speeches being made, the lady began--'Who\ndoes your ladyship think bowed to me _en passant_ just as I was getting\nout of the carriage?--Why, Lady Bellamer!--Can you conceive such\neffrontery?' 'Indeed, I think, in common modesty, she should have waited\nfor your notice!' 'Do you know, I am told on good authority that\nHargrave is determined not to marry her.' Laura's breath came\nshort.--'He is very right,' returned Lady Pelham. 'A man must be a great\nfool to marry where he has had such damning proofs of frailty.' Laura's\nheart seemed to pause for a moment, and then to redouble its\nbeating.--'What Hargrave can this be?' thought she; but she durst not\ninquire. 'I hear,' resumed the lady, 'that his uncle is enraged at him,\nand more for the duel than the _crim. con._' The pencils dropped from\nLaura's hand.--Fain would she have inquired, what she yet so much\ndreaded to know; but her tongue refused its office. 'I see no cause for\nthat,' returned Lady Pelham; 'Hargrave could not possibly refuse to\nfight after such an affair.' 'Oh certainly not!' replied the lady; 'but\nLord Lincourt thinks, that in such a case, Hargrave ought to have\ninsisted upon giving Lord Bellamer the first fire, and then have fired\nhis own pistol in the air.--But, bless me, what ails Miss Montreville,'\ncried the visitor, looking at Laura, who, dreadfully convinced, was\nstealing out of the room. 'Nothing,' answered Laura; and fainted.\n\nLady Pelham called loudly for help; and, while the servants were\nadministering it, stood by conjecturing what could be the cause of\nLaura's illness; wondering whether it could have any possible connection\nwith Colonel Hargrave; or whether it were the effect of mere\nconstitutional habit.\n\nThe moment Laura shewed signs of recollection, Lady Pelham began her\ninterrogation. 'What has been the matter my dear? What made you ill? Did\nany thing affect you? Are you subject to faintings?' Laura remained\nsilent, and, closing her eyes, seemed deaf to all her aunt's questions.\nAfter a pause, Lady Pelham renewed the attack.--'Have you any concern\nwith Colonel Hargrave, Laura?' 'None,' answered Laura, with a smile of\nineffable bitterness; and again closing her eyes, maintained an\nobstinate silence. Weary of ineffectual inquiries, Lady Pelham quitted\nher, giving orders, that she should be assisted into bed, and\nrecommending to her to take some rest.\n\nVain advice! Laura could not rest! From the stupor which had overpowered\nher faculties, she awoke to the full conviction, that all her earthly\nprospects were for ever darkened. Just entering on life, she seemed\nalready forsaken of all its hopes, and all its joys. The affections\nwhich had delighted her youth were torn from the bleeding soul; no\nsacred connection remained to bless her maturity; no endearment awaited\nher decline. In all her long and dreary journey to the grave, she saw no\nkindly resting-place. Still Laura's hopes and wishes had never been\nbounded to this narrow sphere; and when she found here no rest for the\nsole of her foot, she had, in the promises of religion, an ark whither\nshe could turn for shelter. But how should she forget that these\npromises extended not to Hargrave. How shut her ear to the dread voice\nwhich, in threatening the adulterer and the murderer, denounced\nvengeance against Hargrave! With horror unspeakable she considered his\nincorrigible depravity; with agony, revolved its fearful consequences.\n\nYet, while the guilt was hateful in her eyes, her heart was full of love\nand compassion for the offender. The feeling with which she remembered\nhis unfaithfulness to her had no resemblance to jealousy. 'He has been\nmisled,' she cried; 'vilely betrayed by a wretch, who has taken\nadvantage of his weakness. Oh how could she look on that form, that\ncountenance, and see in them only the objects of a passion, vile as the\nheart that cherished it.'--Then she would repent of her want of\ncandour.--'I am unjust, I am cruel,' she said, 'thus to load with all\nthe burden of this foul offence, her who had perhaps the least share in\nit.--No! He must have been the tempter; it is not in woman to be so\nlost.'\n\nBut in the midst of sorrow, whose violence seemed at times almost to\nconfuse her reason, she never hesitated for a moment on the final\ndissolution of her connection with Hargrave. She formed no resolution on\na subject where no alternative seemed to remain, but assumed, as the\nfoundation of all her plans of joyless duty, her eternal separation from\nHargrave; a separation final as death. By degrees she became more able\nto collect her thoughts; and the close of a sleepless night found her\nexercising the valuable habit of seeking in herself the cause of her\nmisfortunes. The issue of her self-examination was the conviction, that\nshe had bestowed on a frail fallible creature, a love disproportioned\nto the merits of any created thing; that she had obstinately clung to\nher idol after she had seen its baseness; and that now the broken reed\nwhereon she had leaned was taken away, that she might restore her trust\nand her love where alone they were due. That time infallibly brings\ncomfort even to the sorest sorrows--that if we make not shipwreck of\nfaith and a good conscience, we save from the storms of life the\nmaterials of peace at least--that lesser joys become valuable when we\nare deprived of those of keener relish--are lessons which even\nexperience teaches but slowly: and Laura had them yet in a great measure\nto learn. She was persuaded that she should go on mourning to the grave.\nWhat yet remained of her path of life seemed to lie through a desert\nwaste, never more to be warmed with the sunshine of affection; never\nmore to be brightened with any ray of hope, save that which beamed from\nbeyond the tomb. She imagined, that lonely and desolate she should pass\nthrough life, and joyfully hail the messenger that called her away; like\nsome wretch, who, cast alone on a desert rock, watches for the sail that\nis to waft him to his native land.\n\nThe despair of strong minds is not listless or inactive. The more Laura\nwas convinced that life was lost as to all its pleasing purposes, the\nmore was she determined that it should be subservient to useful ends.\nEarthly felicity, she was convinced, had fled for ever from her grasp;\nand the only resolution she could form, was never more to pursue it;\nbut, in the persevering discharge of the duties which yet remained to\nher, to seek a preparation for joys which earth has not to bestow. That\nshe might not devote to fruitless lamentation the time which was claimed\nby duty, she, as soon as it was day, attempted to rise, intending to\nspend the morning in acts of resignation for herself, and prayers that\npardon and repentance might be granted to him whose guilt had destroyed\nher peace. But her head was so giddy, that, unable to stand, she was\nobliged to return to her bed. It was long ere she was again able to quit\nit. A slow fever seized her, and brought her to the brink of the grave.\nHer senses, however, remained uninjured, and she had full power and\nleisure to make those reflections which force themselves upon all who\nare sensible of approaching dissolution. Happy were it, if all who smart\nunder disappointment, would anticipate the hour which will assuredly\narrive, when the burden which they impatiently bear shall appear to be\nlighter than vanity! The hand which is soon to be cold, resigns without\na struggle the baubles of the world. Its cheats delude not the eye that\nis for ever closing. A deathbed is that holy ground where the charms of\nthe enchanter are dissolved; where the forms which he had clothed with\nunreal beauty, or aggravated to gigantic horror, are seen in their true\nform and colouring. In its true form and colouring did Laura behold her\ndisappointment; when, with characteristic firmness, she had wrung from\nher attendants, a confession of her danger. With amazement she looked\nback on the infatuation which could waste on any concern less than\neternal, the hopes, the fears, and the wishes which she had squandered\non a passion which now seemed trivial as the vapour scattered by the\nwind.\n\nAt last, aided by the rigid temperance of her former life, and her\nexemplary patience in suffering, the strength of her constitution began\nto triumph over her disorder. As she measured her steps back to earth\nagain, the concerns which had seemed to her reverting eye diminished\ninto nothing, again swelled into importance; but Laura could not soon\nforget the time when she had seen them as they were; and this\nremembrance powerfully aided her mind in its struggle to cast off its\nnow disgraceful shackles. Yet bitter was the struggle; for what is so\npainful as to tear at once from the breast what has twined itself with\nevery fibre, linked itself with every hope, stimulated every desire, and\nlong furnished objects of intense, of unceasing interest. The heart\nwhich death leaves desolate, slowly and gently resigns the affection to\nwhich it has fondly clung. It is permitted to seek indulgence in\nvirtuous sorrow, to rejoice in religious hope; and even memory brings\npleasure dear to the widowed mind. But she who mourned the depravity of\nher lover, felt that she was degraded by her sorrow; hope was, as far as\nhe was concerned, utterly extinguished; and memory presented only a\nmortifying train of weaknesses and self-deceptions.\n\nBut love is not that irremediable calamity which romance has delighted\nto paint, and the vulgar to believe it. Time, vanity, absence, or any of\na hundred other easy remedies, serves to cure the disease in the mild\nform in which it affects feeble minds, while more Herculean spirits tear\noff the poisoned garment, though it be with mortal anguish. In a few\nweeks, the passion which had so long disturbed the peace of Laura was\nhushed to lasting repose; but it was the repose of the land where the\nwhirlwind has passed; dreary and desolate. Her spirits had received a\nshock from which it was long, very long, ere she could rouse them. And\nhe who had ceased to be an object of passion, still excited an interest\nwhich no other human being could awaken. Many a wish did she breathe\nfor his happiness; many a fervent prayer for his reformation. In spite\nof herself, she lamented the extinguished love, as well as the lost\nlover; and never remembered, without a heavy sigh, that the season of\nenthusiastic attachment was, with her, passed never to return.\n\nBut she cordially wished that she might never again behold the cause of\nso much anguish and humiliation. She longed to be distant from all\nchance of such a meeting, and was anxious to recover strength sufficient\nfor her journey to Walbourne. Lady Pelham only waited for her niece's\nrecovery; and, as soon as she could bear the motion of a carriage, they\nleft London.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nThey travelled slowly, and Laura's health seemed improved by the\njourney. The reviving breeze of early spring, the grass field exchanging\nits winter olive for a bright green, the ploughman's cheerful labour,\nthe sower whistling to his measured step, the larch trees putting forth\nthe first and freshest verdure of the woods, the birds springing busy\nfrom the thorn, were objects whose cheering influence would have been\nlost on many a querulous child of disappointment. But they were\nindustriously improved to their proper use by Laura, who acknowledged in\nthem the kindness of a father, mingling with some cordial drop even the\nbitterest cup of sorrow. The grief which had fastened on her heart she\nnever obtruded on her companion. She behaved always with composure,\nsometimes with cheerfulness. She never obliquely reflected upon\nProvidence, by insinuations of the hardness of her fate, nor indulged in\nsplenetic dissertations on the inconstancy and treachery of man. Indeed\nshe never, by the most distant hint, approached the ground of her own\npeculiar sorrow. She could not, without the deepest humiliation, reflect\nthat she had bestowed her love on an object so unworthy. She burnt with\nshame at the thought of having been so blinded, so infatuated, by\nqualities merely external. While she remembered, with extreme vexation,\nthat she had suffered Hargrave to triumph in the confession of her\nregard, she rejoiced that no other witness existed of her folly--that\nshe had never breathed the mortifying secret into any other ear.\n\nIn this frame of mind, she repelled with calm dignity every attempt\nwhich Lady Pelham made to penetrate her sentiments; and behaved in such\na manner that her aunt could not discover whether her spirits were\naffected by languor of body or by distress of mind. Laura, indeed, had\nsingular skill in the useful art of repulsing without offence; and Lady\nPelham, spite of her curiosity, found it impossible to question her\nniece with freedom. Notwithstanding her youth, and her almost dependent\nsituation, Laura inspired Lady Pelham with involuntary awe. Her\ndignified manners, her vigorous understanding, the inflexible integrity\nwhich descended even to the regulation of her forms of speech, extorted\nsome degree of respectful caution from one not usually over careful of\ngiving offence. Lady Pelham was herself at times conscious of this\nrestraint; and her pride was wounded by it. In Laura's absence, she\nsometimes thought of it with impatience, and resolved to cast it off at\ntheir next interview; but whenever they met, the unoffending majesty of\nLaura effaced her resolution, or awed her from putting it in practice.\nShe could not always, however, refrain from using that sort of innuendo\nwhich is vulgarly called _talking at_ one's companions; a sort of\nrhetoric in great request with those who have more spleen than courage,\nand which differs from common scolding only in being a little more\ncowardly and a little more provoking. All her Ladyship's dexterity and\nperseverance in this warfare were entirely thrown away. Whatever might\nbe meant, Laura answered to nothing but what met the ear; and, with\nperverse simplicity, avoided the particular application of general\npropositions. Lady Pelham next tried to coax herself into Laura's\nconfidence. She redoubled her caresses and professions of affection. She\nhinted, not obscurely, that if Laura would explain her wishes, they\nwould meet with indulgence, and even assistance, from zealous\nfriendship. Her professions were received with gratitude--her caresses\nreturned with sensibility; but Laura remained impenetrable. Lady\nPelham's temper could never brook resistance; and she would turn from\nLaura in a pet:--the pitiful garb of anger which cannot disguise, and\ndares not show itself. But Laura never appeared to bestow the slightest\nnotice on her caprice, and received her returning smiles with unmoved\ncomplacency. Laura would fain have loved her aunt; but in spite of\nherself, her affection took feeble root amidst these alternations of\nfrost and sunshine. She was weary of hints and insinuations; and felt\nnot a little pleased that Lady Pelham's fondness for improving and\ngardening seemed likely to release her, during most of the hours of\ndaylight, from this sort of sharpshooting warfare.\n\nIt was several days after their arrival at Walbourne before they were\nvisited by any of the De Courcy family. Undeceived in his hopes of\nLaura's regard, Montague was almost reluctant to see her again. Yet\nfrom the hour when he observed Lady Pelham's carriage drive up the\navenue, he had constantly chosen to study at a window which looked\ntowards Walbourne. Laura, too, often looked towards Norwood, excusing to\nherself the apparent neglect of her friends, by supposing that they had\nnot been informed of her arrival. Lady Pelham was abroad superintending\nher gardeners, and Laura employed in her own apartment, when she was\ncalled to receive De Courcy. For the first time since the wreck of all\nher hopes, joy flushed the wan cheek of Laura, and fired her eye with\ntransient lustre. 'I shall hear the voice of friendship once more,' said\nshe, and she hastened down stairs with more speed than suited her but\nhalf-recovered strength. 'Dear Mr De Courcy,' she cried, joyfully\nadvancing towards him! De Courcy scarcely ventured to raise his eyes.\nLaura held out her hand to him. 'She loves a libertine!' thought he,\nand, scarcely touching it, he drew back. With grief and surprise, Laura\nread the cold and melancholy expression of his face. Her feeble spirits\nfailed under so chilling a reception; and while, in a low tremulous\nvoice, she inquired for Mrs and Miss De Courcy, unbidden tears wandered\ndown her cheeks. In replying, Montague again turned his eyes towards\nher; and, shocked at the paleness and dejection of her altered\ncountenance, remembered only Laura ill and in sorrow. 'Good Heavens!' he\nexclaimed, with a voice of the tenderest interest, 'Laura--Miss\nMontreville, you are ill--you are unhappy!' Laura, vexed that her\nweakness should thus extort compassion, hastily dried her tears. 'I have\nbeen ill,' said she, 'and am still so weak that any trifle can\ndiscompose me.' Montague's colour rose. 'It is then a mere trifle in her\neyes,' thought he, 'that I should meet her with coldness.' 'And yet,'\ncontinued Laura, reading mortification in his face, 'it is no trifle to\nfear that I have given offence where I owe so much gratitude.' 'Talk not\nof gratitude, I beseech you,' said De Courcy, 'I have no claim, no wish,\nto excite it.' 'Mr De Courcy,' cried Laura, bursting into tears of sad\nremembrance, 'has all your considerate friendship, all your soothing\nkindness to him who is gone, no claim to the gratitude of his child!'\nMontague felt that he stood at this moment upon dangerous ground, and he\ngladly availed himself of this opportunity to quit it. He led Laura to\ntalk of her father, and of the circumstances of his death; and was not\nashamed to mingle sympathetic tears with those which her narrative wrung\nfrom her. In her detail, she barely hinted at the labour by which she\nhad supported her father; and avoided all allusion to the wants which\nshe had endured. If any thing could have exalted her in the opinion of\nDe Courcy, it would have been the humility which sought no praise to\nrecompense exertion--no admiration to reward self-denial. 'The praise of\nman is with her as nothing,' thought he, gazing on her wasted form and\nfaded features with fonder adoration than ever he had looked on her full\nblaze of beauty. 'She has higher hopes and nobler aims. And can such a\ncreature love a sensualist!--Now, too, when his infamy cannot be unknown\nto her! Yet it must be so--she has never named him, even while\ndescribing scenes where he was daily present; and why this silence if he\nwere indifferent to her? If I durst mention him!--but I cannot give her\npain.'\n\nFrom this reverie De Courcy was roused by the entrance of Lady Pelham,\nwhose presence brought to his recollection the compliments and\nceremonial which Laura had driven from his mind. He apologized for\nhaving delayed his visit; and excused himself for having made it alone,\nby saying that his sister was absent on a visit to a friend, and that\nhis mother could not yet venture abroad; but he warmly entreated that\nthe ladies would wave etiquette, and see Mrs De Courcy at Norwood. Lady\nPelham, excusing herself for the present on the plea of her niece's\nindisposition, urged De Courcy to direct his walks often towards\nWalbourne; in charity, she said, to Laura, who being unable to take\nexercise, spent her forenoons alone, sighing, she supposed, for some\nScotch Strephon. Laura blushed; and Montague took his leave, pondering\nwhether the blush was deepened by any feeling of consciousness.\n\n'She has a witchcraft in her that no language can express--no heart\nwithstand--,' said De Courcy, suddenly breaking a long silence, as he\nand his mother were sitting t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate after dinner. 'Marriage is an\nexcellent talisman against witchcraft,' said De Courcy, gravely; 'but\nMiss Montreville has charms that will delight the more the better they\nare known. There is such noble simplicity, such considerate benevolence,\nsuch total absence of vanity and selfishness in her character, that no\nwoman was ever better fitted to embellish and endear domestic life.'\n'Perhaps in time,' pursued De Courcy, 'I might have become not unworthy\nof such a companion--But now it matters not,'--and, suppressing a very\nbitter sigh, he took up a book which he had of late been reading to his\nmother. 'You know, Montague,' said Mrs De Courcy, 'I think differently\nfrom you upon this subject. I am widely mistaken in Miss Montreville, if\nshe could bestow her preference on a libertine, knowing him to be\nsuch.' Montague took involuntary pleasure in hearing this opinion\nrepeated; yet he had less faith in it than he usually had in the\nopinions of his mother. 'After the emotion which his presence excited,'\nreturned he,--'an emotion which even these low people--I cannot think of\nit with patience,' cried he, tossing away the book, and walking hastily\nup and down the room. 'To betray her weakness, her _only_ weakness, to\nsuch observers--to the wretch himself.' 'My dear De Courcy, do you make\nno allowance for the exaggeration, the rage for the romantic, so common\nto uneducated minds?' 'Wilkins could have no motive for inventing such a\ntale,' replied De Courcy; 'and if it had _any_ foundation, there is no\nroom for doubt.' 'Admitting the truth of all you have heard,' resumed\nMrs De Courcy, 'I see no reason for despairing of success. If I know any\nthing of character, Miss Montreville's attachments will ever follow\nexcellence, real or imaginary. Your worth is real, Montague; and, as\nsuch, it will in time approve itself to her.' 'Ah, Madam, had her\naffection been founded even on imaginary excellence, must it not now\nhave been completely withdrawn--now, when she cannot be unacquainted\nwith his depravity. Yet she loves him still.--I am sure she loves him.\nWhy else this guarded silence in regard to him?--Why not mention that\nshe permitted his daily visits--saw him even on the night when her\nfather died?' 'Supposing,' returned Mrs De Courcy, 'that her affection\nhad been founded on imaginary excellence, might not traces of the ruins\nremain perceptible, even after the foundation had been taken away? Come,\ncome, Montague, you are only four-and-twenty, you can afford a few years\npatience. If you act prudently, I am convinced that your perseverance\nwill succeed; but if it should not, I know how you can bear\ndisappointment. I am certain that your happiness depends not on the\nsmile of any face, however fair.' 'I am ashamed,' said De Courcy, 'to\nconfess how much my peace depends upon Laura. You know I have no\nambition--all my joys must be domestic. It is as a husband and a father\nthat all my wishes must be fulfilled--and all that I have ever fancied\nof venerable and endearing, so meet in her, that no other woman can ever\nfill her place.' 'That you have no ambition,' replied Mrs De Courcy, 'is\none of the reasons why I join in your wishes. If your happiness had any\nconnection with splendour, I should have regretted your choice of a\nwoman without fortune. But all that is necessary for your comfort you\nwill find in the warmth of heart with which Laura will return your\naffection--the soundness of principle with which she will assist you in\nyour duties. Still, perhaps, you might find these qualities in others,\nthough not united in an equal degree; but I confess to you, Montague, I\ndespair of your again meeting with a woman whose dispositions and\npursuits are so congenial to your own;--a woman, whose cultivated mind\nand vigorous understanding, may make her the companion of your studies\nas well as of your lighter hours.' 'My dear mother,' cried De Courcy,\naffectionately grasping her hand, 'it is no wonder that I persecute you\nwith this subject so near to my heart for you always, and you alone,\nsupport my hopes. Yet should I even at last obtain this treasure, I must\never regret that I cannot awaken the enthusiasm which belongs only to a\nfirst attachment.' 'Montague,' said Mrs De Courcy, smiling, 'from what\nromance have you learnt that sentiment? However I shall not attempt the\nlabour of combating it, for I prophesy that, before the change can be\nnecessary, you will learn to be satisfied with being loved with reason.'\n'Many a weary day must pass before I can even hope for this cold\npreference. Indeed, if her choice is to be decided by mere rational\napprobation, why should I hope that it will fall upon me? Yet, if it be\npossible, her friendship I will gain--and I would not exchange it for\nthe love of all her sex.' 'She already esteems you--highly esteems you,'\nsaid Mrs De Courcy; 'and I repeat that I think you need not despair of\nanimating esteem into a warmer sentiment. But will you profit by my\nknowledge of my sex, Montague? You know, the less use we make of our own\nwisdom, the fonder we grow of bestowing it on others in the form of\nadvice! Keep your secret carefully, Montague. Much of your hope depends\non your caution. Pretensions to a pre-engaged heart are very generally\nrepaid with dislike.' Montague promised attention to his mother's\nadvice; but added, that he feared he should not long be able to follow\nit. 'I am a bad dissembler,' said he, 'and on this subject, it is\nalleged, that ladies are eagle-eyed.' 'Miss Montreville, of all women\nliving, has the least vanity,' returned Mrs De Courcy; 'and you may\nalways reinforce your caution, by recollecting that the prepossessions\nwhich will certainly be against you as a lover, may be secured in your\nfavour as a friend.'\n\nThe next day found De Courcy again at Walbourne; and again he enjoyed a\nlong and private interview with Laura. Though their conversation turned\nonly on indifferent subjects, De Courcy observed the settled melancholy\nwhich had taken possession of her mind. It was no querulous complaining\nsorrow, but a calm sadness, banishing all the cheerful illusions of a\nlife which it still valued as the preparation for a better. To that\nbetter world all her hopes and wishes seemed already fled; and the saint\nherself seemed waiting, with resigned desire, for permission to depart.\nDe Courcy's fears assigned to her melancholy its true cause. He would\nhave given worlds to know the real state of her sentiments, and to\nascertain how far her attachment had survived the criminality of\nHargrave. But he had not courage to probe the painful wound. He could\nnot bear to inflict upon Laura even momentary anguish; perhaps he even\nfeared to know the full extent of those regrets which she lavished on\nhis rival. With scrupulous delicacy he avoided approaching any subject\nwhich could at all lead her thoughts towards the cause of her sorrow,\nand never even seemed to notice the dejection which wounded him to the\nsoul.\n\n'The spring of her mind is for ever destroyed,' said he to Mrs De\nCourcy, 'and yet she retains all her angelic benevolence. She strives to\nmake pleasing to others, the objects that will never more give pleasure\nto her.' Mrs De Courcy expressed affectionate concern, but added, 'I\nnever knew of a sorrow incurable at nineteen. We must bring Laura to\nNorwood, and find employments for her suited to her kindly nature.\nMeanwhile do you exert yourself to rouse her; and, till she is well\nenough to leave home, I shall freely resign to her all my claims upon\nyour time.' De Courcy faithfully profited by his mother's permission,\nand found almost every day an excuse for visiting Walbourne. Sometimes\nhe brought a book which he read aloud to the ladies; sometimes he\nborrowed one, which he chose to return in person; now he wished to shew\nLaura a medal, and now he had some particularly fine flower-seeds for\nLady Pelham. Chemical experiments were an excellent pretext; for they\nwere seldom completed at a visit, and the examination of one created a\ndesire for another. Laura was not insensible to his attentions. She\nbelieved that he attributed whatever was visible of her depression to\nregrets for her father; and she was by turns ashamed of permitting her\nweakness to wear the mask of filial piety, and thankful that she escaped\nthe degradation of being pitied as a love-sick girl. But love had now no\nshare in Laura's melancholy. Compassion, strong indeed to a painful\nexcess, was the only gentle feeling that mingled with the pain of\nremembering Hargrave. Who that, in early youth, gives way to the\nchilling conviction, that nothing on earth will ever again kindle a wish\nor a hope, can look without sadness on the long pilgrimage that spreads\nbefore them? Laura looked upon hers with resigned sadness, and a\nthousand times repeated to herself that it was but a point, compared\nwith what lay beyond. Hopeless of happiness, she yet forced herself to\nseek short pleasure in the charms of nature, and the comforts of\naffluence; calling them the flowers which a bountiful hand had scattered\nin the desert which it was needful that she should tread alone. It was\nwith some surprise that she found De Courcy's visits produced pleasure\nwithout requiring an effort to be pleased; and with thankfulness she\nacknowledged that the enjoyments of the understanding were still open to\nher, though those of the heart were for ever withdrawn.\n\nIn the meantime her health improved rapidly, and she was able to join in\nLady Pelham's rambles in the shrubbery. To avoid particularity, De\nCourcy had often quitted Laura to attend on these excursions; and he\nrejoiced when her recovered strength allowed him to gratify, without\nimprudence, the inclination which brought him to Walbourne. It often,\nhowever, required all his influence to persuade her to accompany him in\nhis walks with Lady Pelham. Her Ladyship's curiosity had by no means\nsubsided. On the contrary, it was rather exasperated by her conviction\nthat her niece's dejection had not been the consequence of ill health,\nsince it continued after that plea was removed; and Laura was constantly\ntormented with oblique attempts to discover what she was determined\nshould never be known.\n\nLady Pelham's attacks were now become the more provoking, because she\ncould address her hints to a third person, who, not aware of their\ntendency, might strengthen them by assent, or unconsciously point them\nas they were intended. She contrived to make even her very looks\ntormenting, by directing, upon suitable occasions, sly glances of\ndiscovery to Laura's face; where, if they found out nothing, they at\nleast insinuated that there was something to find out. She was\ninimitably dexterous and indefatigable in improving every occasion of\ninnuendo. Any subject, however irrelevant, furnished her with the\nweapons of her warfare. 'Does this flower never open any further?' asked\nLaura, shewing one to De Courcy--'No,' said Lady Pelham, pushing in\nbetween them; 'that close thing, wrapped up in itself, never expands in\nthe genial warmth; it never shews its heart.' 'This should be a precious\nbook with so many envelopes,' said Laura, untying a parcel.--'More\nlikely,' said Lady Pelham, with a sneer, 'that what is folded in so many\ndoublings won't be worth looking into.' 'This day is cold for the\nseason,' said De Courcy, one day warming himself after his ride.\n'Spring colds are the most chilling of any,' said Lady Pelham. 'They are\nlike a repulsive character in youth; one is not prepared for them. The\nfrosts of winter are more natural.'\n\nLady Pelham was not satisfied with using the occasions that presented\nthemselves; she invented others. When the weather confined her at home,\nand she had nothing else to occupy her, she redoubled her industry.\n'Bless me, what a sentiment!' she exclaimed, affecting surprise and\nconsternation, though she had read the book which contained it above\ntwenty times before.--'\"Always live with a friend as if he might one day\nbecome an enemy!\" I can conceive nothing more detestable. A cold-hearted\nsuspicious wretch! Now to a friend I could not help being all open and\ningenuous but a creature capable of having such a thought, could never\nhave a friend.' Lady Pelham ran on for a while, contrasting her open\ningenuous self, with the odious character which her significant looks\nappropriated to her niece, till even the mild Laura was provoked to\nreply. Fixing her eyes upon her aunt with calm severity, 'If\nRochefoucault meant,' said she, 'that a friend should be treated with\nsuspicious confidence, as if he might one day betray, I agree with your\nLadyship in thinking such a sentiment incompatible with friendship; but\nwe are indebted to him for a useful lesson, if he merely intended to\nremind us that it is easy to alienate affection without proceeding to\nreal injury, and very possible to forfeit esteem without incurring\nserious guilt.'--The blood mounted in Lady Pelham's face, but the calm\nausterity of Laura's eye imposed silence, and she continued to turn over\nthe pages of her book, while her niece rose and left the room. She then\ntossed it away, and walked angrily up and down, fretting between baulked\ncuriosity and irritated pride. Finding every other mode of attack\nunsuccessful, she once more resolved to have recourse to direct\ninterrogation. This intention had been frequently formed, and as often\ndefeated by the dignified reserve of Laura; but now that Lady Pelham\nfelt her pride concerned, she grew angry enough to be daring. It was so\nprovoking to be kept in awe by a mere girl, a dependent. Lady Pelham\ncould at any time meditate herself into a passion; she did so on the\npresent occasion; and accordingly resolved and executed in the same\nbreath. She followed Laura to her apartment, determined to insist upon\nknowing what affected her spirits. Laura received her with a smile so\ngracious, that, spite of herself, her wrath began to evaporate.\nConceiving it proper, however, to maintain an air of importance, she\nbegan with an aspect that announced hostility, and a voice in which\nanger increased intended gravity into surliness. 'Miss Montreville, if\nyou are at leisure I wish to speak with you.' 'Quite at leisure, Madam,'\nsaid Laura in a tone of the most conciliating good humour, and motioning\nher aunt to a seat by the fire. 'It is extremely unpleasant,' said Lady\nPelham, tossing her head to escape the steady look of inquiry which\nLaura directed towards her; 'It is extremely unpleasant (at least if one\nhas any degree of sensibility) to live with persons who always seem\nunhappy, and are always striving to conceal it, especially when one can\nsee no cause for their unhappiness.' 'It must indeed be very\ndistressing,' returned Laura mentally preparing for her defence. 'Then I\nwonder,' said Lady Pelham, with increased acrimony of countenance, 'why\nyou choose to subject me to so disagreeable a situation. It is very\nevident that there is something in your mind which you are either afraid\nor ashamed to tell.' 'I am sorry,' said Laura, with unmoved\nself-possession, 'to be the cause of any uneasiness to your Ladyship. I\ndo not pretend that my spirits are high, but I should not have thought\ntheir depression unaccountable. The loss of my only parent, and such a\nparent! is reason for lasting sorrow; and my own so recent escape from\nthe jaws of the grave, might impose seriousness upon levity itself.'--'I\nhave a strong notion, however, that none of these is the true cause of\nyour penseroso humours. Modern misses don't break their hearts for the\nloss of their parents.--I remember you fainted away just when Mrs\nHarrington was talking to me of Colonel Hargrave's affair; and I know he\nwas quartered for a whole year in your neighbourhood.'\n\nLady Pelham stopped to reconnoitre her niece's face, but without\nsuccess; for Laura had let fall her scissors, and was busily seeking\nthem on the carpet. 'Did you know him?' inquired Lady Pelham. 'I have\nseen him,' answered Laura, painfully recollecting how little she had\nreally known him. 'Did he visit at Glenalbert?' resumed her Ladyship,\nrecovering her temper, as she thought she had discovered a clue to\nLaura's sentiments. 'Yes, Madam, often;' replied Laura, who having, with\na strong effort, resumed her self-possession, again submitted her\ncountenance to inspection. 'And he was received there as a lover I\npresume?' said Lady Pelham, in a tone of interrogation. Laura fixed on\nher aunt one of her cool commanding glances. 'Your Ladyship,' returned\nshe, 'seems so much in earnest, that if the question were a little less\nextraordinary, I should almost have thought you expected a serious\nanswer.' Lady Pelham's eyes were not comfortably placed, and she\nremoved them by turns to every piece of furniture in the apartment.\nSpeedily recovering herself, she returned to the charge. 'I think, after\nthe friendship I have shewn, I have some right to be treated with\nconfidence.' 'My dear Madam,' said Laura, gratefully pressing Lady\nPelham's hand between her own, 'believe me, I am not forgetful of the\nkindness which has afforded me shelter and protection; but there are\nsome subjects of which no degree of intimacy will permit the discussion.\nIt is evident, that whatever proposals have hitherto been made to me,\nhave received such an answer as imposes discretion upon me. No addresses\nwhich I accept shall ever be a secret from your Ladyship--those which I\nreject I am not equally entitled to reveal.' 'By which I understand you\nto say, that you have rejected Colonel Hargrave?' said Lady Pelham. 'By\nno means,' answered Laura, with spirit, 'I was far from saying so. I\nmerely intended to express my persuasion, that you are too generous to\nurge me on a sort of subject where I ought not to be communicative.'\n'Very well, Miss Montreville,' cried Lady Pelham, rising in a pet, 'I\ncomprehend the terms on which you choose that we should live. I may have\nthe honour of being your companion, but I must not aspire to the rank of\na friend.' 'Indeed, my dear aunt,' said Laura, in a voice irresistibly\nsoothing, 'I have no earthly wish so strong as to find a real friend in\nyou: but,' added she, with an insinuating smile, 'I shall never earn the\ntreasure with tales of luckless love.' 'Well, Madam,' said Lady Pelham,\nturning to quit the room, 'I shall take care for the future not to press\nmyself into your confidence; and as it is not the most delightful thing\nin the world to live in the midst of ambuscades, I shall intrude as\nlittle as possible on your more agreeable engagements.' 'Pray, don't\ngo,' said Laura with perfect good humour, and holding upon her delicate\nfingers a cap which she had been making, 'I have finished your cap. Pray\nhave the goodness to let me try it on.' Female vanity is at least a\n_sexag\u00c3\u00a9naire_. Lady Pelham sent a side glance towards the cap. 'Pray\ndo,' said Laura, taking her hand, and coaxingly pulling her back. 'Make\nhaste then,' said Lady Pelham, sullenly, 'for I have no time to spare.'\n'How becoming,' cried Laura, as she fixed on the cap, 'I never saw you\nlook so well in any thing. Look at it;' and she held a looking-glass to\nher aunt. The ill humour which had resisted the graces of the loveliest\nface in the world, could not stand a favourable view of her own; and\nLady Pelham quitted Laura with a gracious compliment to her genius for\nmillinery, and a declaration, that the cap should be worn the next day,\nin honour of a visit from Mr De Courcy and Harriet.\n\nThe next day the expected guests dined at Walbourne. As Harriet had just\nreturned from her excursion, this was the first time that she had seen\nLaura, and the meeting gave them mutual pleasure. Harriet seemed in even\nmore than usual spirits; and Laura, roused by the presence of persons\nwhom she loved and respected, shewed a cheerfulness more unconstrained\nthan she had felt since her father's death. Montague, who watched her\nassiduously, was enchanted to perceive that she could once more smile\nwithout effort; and, in the joy of his heart, resumed a gaiety which had\nof late been foreign to him. But the life of the party was Lady Pelham;\nfor who could be so delightful, so extravagantly entertaining as Lady\nPelham could be when she pleased? And she did please this afternoon; for\na train of fortunate circumstances had put her into high good humour.\nShe not only wore the becoming cap; but had hit, without difficulty, the\nmost becoming mode of putting it on. The cook had done her office in a\nmanner altogether faultless; and the gardener had brought in such a\nsallad! its like had never been seen in the county.\n\nMiss De Courcy was extremely anxious that Laura should pass a few days\nat Norwood. But Laura, remembering the coolness which had of late\nsubsisted between herself and Lady Pelham, and unwilling to postpone her\nendeavours to efface every trace of it, objected that she could not quit\nher aunt for such a length of time. Harriet immediately proposed to\ninvite Lady Pelham.--'I'll set about it this instant, while she's in the\nvein,' said she. 'This sunshine is too bright to last.' Laura looked\nvery grave, and Harriet hastened to execute her purpose. There is no\nweakness of their neighbours which mankind so instinctively convert to\ntheir own use as vanity. Except to secure Laura's company, Harriet had\nnot the slightest desire for Lady Pelham's. Yet she did not even name\nher friend while she pressed Lady Pelham so earnestly to visit Norwood,\nthat she succeeded to her wish, and obtained a promise that the ladies\nshould accompany her and her brother home on the following day.\n\nWhen at the close of an agreeable evening, Laura attended her friend to\nher chamber, Harriet, with more sincerity than politeness, regretted\nthat Lady Pelham was to join their party to Norwood. 'I wish the old\nlady would have allowed you to go without her,' said she. 'She'll\ninterrupt a thousand things I had to say to you. However, my mother can\nkeep her in conversation. She'll be so delighted to see you, that she'll\npay the penalty without a grudge.' 'I shall feel the more indebted to\nyour mother's welcome,' said Laura, with extreme gravity, 'because she\nwill extend it to a person to whom I owe obligations that cannot be\nrepaid.' Harriet, blushing, apologized for her freedom; and Laura\naccepting the apology with smiles of courtesy and affection, the friends\nseparated for the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nNorwood had appeared to Laura to be little more than a mile distant from\nWalbourne. The swellings of the ground had deceived her. It was more\nthan twice that distance. As the carriage approached Norwood, Laura\nperceived traces of a noble park, changed from its former purpose to one\nmore useful, though less magnificent. The corn fields were intermixed by\nvenerable avenues, and studded with gigantic elm and oak. Through one of\nthese avenues, straight as a dart, and darkened by the woods that closed\nover it, the party drove up to a massive gate. In the door of a turreted\nlodge, overgrown with hornbeam, stood the grey-haired porter, waiting\ntheir arrival. He threw open the gate with one hand, and respectfully\nstood with his hat in the other, while De Courcy checked his horse to\ninquire for the old man's family.\n\nThe avenue now quitted its formality, to wind along the bank of a rapid\nstream, till the woods suddenly opening to the right, discovered the\nlawn, green as an emerald, and kept with a neatness truly English. A\nvariety of flowering shrubs were scattered over it, and here and there a\nlofty forest-tree threw its quivering shadow; while tall spruce-firs,\ntheir branches descending to the ground, formed a contrast to its\nverdure. At the extremity of this lawn stood Norwood, a large\ncastellated building; and, while Laura looked on it, she imagined the\ninterior dull with baronial magnificence.\n\nThe carriage drove up to the door, and Laura could not helping smiling\nat the cordial welcome that seemed to await De Courcy. The great\nNewfoundland dog that lay upon the steps leapt upon him, and expressed\nhis joy by a hundred clumsy gambols; while John, the old servant whom\nshe had seen in Audley Street, busied himself about his master, with an\nofficiousness that evidently came from the heart, leaving Lady Pelham's\nattendants to wait upon their mistress and her companions. De Courcy,\ngiving his hand to Lady Pelham, conducted her, followed by Harriet and\nLaura, into the room where Mrs De Courcy was sitting; and the next\nmoment his heart throbbed with pleasure, while he saw the beloved of his\nsoul locked in his mother's arms.\n\nWhen the first joy of the meeting was over, Laura had leisure to observe\nthe interior of the mansion, which differed not less from her\nexpectations than from any thing she had before seen. Though it was\nequally remote from the humble simplicity of her cottage of Glenalbert,\nand the gaudiness of Lady Pelham's more modern abode, she saw nothing of\nthe gloomy splendour which she had fancied; every thing breathed comfort\nand repose. The furniture, though not without magnificence, was\nunadorned and substantial, grandeur holding the second place to\nusefulness. The marble hall through which she had entered, was almost\ncovered with matting. In the spacious room in which she was sitting, the\nlittle Turkey carpet of our forefathers had given place to one of\nhomelier grain but far larger dimensions. The apartment was liberally\nstored with couches, footstools, and elbow chairs. A harp occupied one\nwindow, a piano-forte stood near it; many books were scattered about, in\nbindings which shewed they were not meant for ornament: and in the\nchimney blazed a fire which would have done credit to the days of\nElizabeth.\n\nThe dinner hour was four; and punctual to a moment the dinner appeared,\nplain, neat, and substantial. It was served without tumult, partaken of\nwith appetite, and enlivened by general hilarity, and good will. When\nthe ladies rose from table, Harriet offered to conduct Laura through the\nother apartments, which exactly corresponded with those she had seen.\nThe library was spacious; and besides an excellent collection of books,\ncontained globes, astronomical instruments, and cabinets of minerals and\ncoins. A smaller room which opened from it, used as De Courcy's\nlaboratory, was filled with chemical and mechanical apparatus. Comfort,\nneatness, and peace reigned everywhere, and Norwood seemed a fit retreat\nfor literary leisure and easy hospitality.\n\nBetween music, work, and conversation, the evening passed away\ncheerfully; nor did Laura mark its flight till the great house clock\nstruck nine. The conversation suddenly paused; Harriet laid aside her\nwork; Mrs De Courcy's countenance assumed a pleasing seriousness; and\nMontague, quitting his place by Laura's side, seated himself in a\npatriarchal-looking chair at the upper end of the room. Presently John\nentered, followed by all the domestics of the family. He placed before\nhis master a reading desk and a large bible, and then sat down at a\ndistance with his fellow servants.\n\nWith a manner serious and earnest, as one impressed with a just sense of\ntheir importance, Montague read a portion of the Holy Scriptures. He\nclosed the volume; and all present sunk upon their knees. In plain but\nsolemn language, he offered a petition in the name of all, that all\nmight be endowed with the graces of the Christian spirit. In the name of\nall he confessed that they were unworthy of the blessings they implored.\nIn the name of all, he gave thanks for the means of improvement, and for\nthe hopes of glory. He next, more particularly, besought a blessing on\nthe circumstances of their several conditions. Among the joyous faces of\nthis happy household, Laura had observed one alone clouded with sorrow.\nIt was that of a young modest-looking girl in deep mourning, whose\naudible sobs attested that she was the subject of a prayer which\ncommended an orphan to the Father of the fatherless. The worship was\nclosed; the servants withdrew. A silence of a few moments ensued; and\nLaura could not help gazing with delight, not unmingled with awe, on the\ntraces of serene benevolence and manly piety, which lingered on the\ncountenance of De Courcy.\n\n'Happy Harriet,' said she, when she was alone with her friend, 'Would\nthat I had been your sister!' Harriet laughed. 'You need not laugh, my\ndear,' continued Laura, with most unembarrassed simplicity, 'I did not\nmean your brother's wife, but his sister, and Mrs De Courcy's daughter.'\n\nThough Miss De Courcy was much less in Montague's confidence than her\nmother, she was not ignorant of his preference for Laura; but Mrs De\nCourcy had so strongly cautioned her against even hinting this\npreference to the object of it, that, though she but half guessed the\nreasons of her mother's injunction, she was afraid to disobey. That\nLaura was even acquainted with Hargrave was unknown to Harriet; for De\nCourcy was almost as tenacious of Laura's secret as she herself was, and\nwould as soon have thought of giving up his own heart to the frolics of\na kitten, as of exposing that of Laura to the _badinage_ of his sister.\nThis kind precaution left Laura perfectly at her ease with Harriet, an\nease which would quickly have vanished, had she known her to be\nacquainted with her humiliating story.\n\nThe young ladies had rambled over half the grounds of Norwood before the\nfamily had assembled at a cheerful breakfast; and as soon as it was\nended, Harriet proposed that Laura should assist her with her advice in\ncomposing a water-colour drawing from one of her own pictures. 'We'll\nleave Lady Pelham and my mother in possession of the drawing-room,' said\nshe, 'for the pictures all hang in the library. I wanted them put up in\nthe sitting-room, but Montague would have them where they are--and so he\ncarried his point, for mamma humours him in everything.' 'Perhaps,'\nreturned Laura, 'Mrs De Courcy thinks that he has some right to dictate\nin his own house.' 'Well, that's true,' cried Harriet. 'I protest I had\nforgotten that this house was not my mother's.'\n\nThe picture which Miss De Courcy had fixed upon, was that of Leonidas,\nand Laura would far rather have been excused from interference; yet, as\nshe could not with propriety escape, nothing remained but to summon her\ncomposure, and to study anew this resemblance of her unworthy lover. She\ntook her work, and began quietly to superintend Harriet's progress.\nTheir employments did not interrupt conversation; and though Laura's was\nat first a little embarrassed, she soon recovered her ease. 'Do touch\nthe outline of the mouth for me,' said Harriet; 'I can't hit the\nresemblance at all.' Laura excused herself, saying, that since her\nfever, her hand had been unsteady. 'Oh, here's Montague; he'll do it.\nCome hither Montague, and sketch a much prettier mouth than your own.'\nDe Courcy, who had approached his sister before he understood her\nrequest, shrunk back. She could scarcely have proposed an employment\nless agreeable to him; and he was hastily going to refuse it, when,\nhappening to meet the eye of Laura, in the dread that she should detect\nhis consciousness, he snatched the pencil and began.\n\nHarriet having thus transferred her work, quickly found out other\noccupation. 'Oh, by the by, my dear,' said she to Laura, 'your Leonidas\nis the greatest likeness in the world of my old beau, Colonel Hargrave.\nBless me, how she blushes! Ah! I see Hargrave has not been so long in\nScotland for nothing!' 'Take away that thing, Harriet,' cried De Courcy,\nquite thrown off his guard, and pushing the drawing from him. 'I see no\nreason why _everybody_ should do for you what you ought to be doing for\nyourself.' 'Hey-day, what ails the man,' cried Harriet, looking after\nher brother to the window, whither he had retreated. 'You need not be so\nangry at me for making Laura blush. I dare say she likes it; it becomes\nher so well.' 'If you are accustomed to say such strange things to your\nfriends, my dear Harriet,' said Laura, 'the blushes you raise will not\nalways have that advantage. The colourings of anger are not generally\nbecoming.' 'So, with that meek face of yours, you would have me believe\nthat it is downright rage that has made you all scarlet. No, no, my\ndear--there is rage, and there is the colour of it, too, (pointing to\nMontague's face); and if you'll put your two heads together before the\nglass, you will see whether the colours are a bit alike!' Montague,\nrecovering his temper, tried to laugh, and succeeded very ill. 'I don't\nwonder you laugh,' said Laura, not venturing to look round to him, 'at\nhearing Harriet, on such slender grounds, exalt such a matter-of-fact\nperson as myself, into the heroine of a romance. But, to spare your\nimagination, Harriet, I will tell you, that your old beau, as you call\nhim, being the handsomest man I had seen, I saw no harm in making use of\nhis beauty in my picture.' 'Well, I protest,' cried Harriet, 'it was\nquite by accident I thought of mentioning it, for I had not the least\nidea that ever you had seen Hargrave.' 'And, now that you have made that\nmighty discovery,' said De Courcy, endeavouring to appear unconcerned,\n'I suppose you'll poison Miss Montreville; for you know you were so in\nlove with Hargrave, that I was obliged to put a rail round the fish-pond\nto prevent _felo de se_.' 'In love,' said Harriet, yawning, 'ay, so I\nwas indeed, for three whole days when I had nothing else to do. But only\nthink of the sly girl never even to name him to me! Well! well! I shall\nworm it all out of her when we are by ourselves, though she won't blab\nbefore you.' 'I will give you an opportunity this moment,' said De\nCourcy, who, quite unable to bear the subject any longer, determined to\nmake his mother interrupt it, and immediately went in search of her. In\na few minutes Mrs De Courcy appeared, and dismissed her unwilling\ndaughter to escort Lady Pelham to the flower-garden, while Laura\npreferred remaining at home.\n\nAt the next opportunity, Harriet executed her threat, in so far as\ndepended upon her. She did what she could to rally Laura out of her\nsecret, but she totally failed of success. Laura, now upon her guard,\nnot only evaded making any discovery, but, by the easy indifference of\nher answers, convinced Harriet that there was nothing to discover.\nIndeed, her suspicion was merely a transient thought, arising from\nLaura's confusion at her sudden attack, and scarcely outlived the moment\nthat gave it birth; though the emotion which Montague had shewn,\nconfirmed his sister in the belief of his attachment to Laura.\n\nThe subject thus entirely dropped which Laura could never approach\nwithout pain, the time of her visit to Norwood glided away in peace and\ncomfort, every day lessening the dejection which she had believed, nay\nalmost wished, would follow her to the grave. Still, however, the traces\nof it were sufficiently visible to the observant eye of love; and\nMontague found in it an interest not to be awakened by the brightest\nflashes of gaiety. 'There is a charm inexpressible in her sadness,' said\nhe to Mrs De Courcy. 'I think,' said Mrs De Courcy, 'I can observe that\nthat charm is decaying. I think, if it should entirely disappear before\nyour fates are more closely united, you need not lament its departure.\nThese cypresses look graceful bending over the urn there in the vista,\nbut I should not like them to darken the sitting-room.'\n\nThe only habit, common to love-lorn damsels, in which Laura indulged,\nwas that of preferring solitary rambles; a habit, however, which had\nbeen imbibed long before she had any title to that character. Delighted\nwith the environs of Norwood, she sometimes wandered beyond the dressed\nground into the park, where art still embellished without restraining\nnature. The park might, indeed, have better deserved the name of an\nornamented farm; for the lawns were here and there diversified by\ncornfields, and enlivened by the habitations of the labourers necessary\nto the agriculturist. These cottages, banished by fashion far from every\nlordly residence, were contrived so as to unite beauty with usefulness;\nthey gave added interest to the landscape even to the eye of a stranger,\nbut far more to that of De Courcy, for he knew that every one of them\ncontained useful hands or graceful hearts; youth for whom he provided\nemployment, or age whose past services he repaid. Here the blue smoke\ncurled from amidst the thicket; there the white wall enlivened the\nmeadow; here the casement flashed bright with the setting sun; there the\nwoodbine and the creeping rose softened the colouring that would have\nglared on the eye.\n\nLaura had followed the windings of a little green lane, till the woods\nwhich darkened it suddenly opened into a small field, sheltered by them\non every side, which seemed to form the territory of a cottage of\nsingular neatness and beauty. In a porch covered with honeysuckle, which\nled through a flower-garden to the house, a lovely little boy about\nthree years old was playing with De Courcy's great Newfoundland dog. The\nchild was stretching on tiptoe to hug with one arm the neck of his\nrough companion; while, with the other hand, he was playfully offering\nthe animal a bit of bread, and then snatching it in sport away. Neptune,\nnot used to be so tantalized, made a catch at his prey; but the child\nsucceeded in preserving his prize, and, laughing, hid it behind him. The\nnext moment Laura saw the dog throw him down, and heard a piercing cry.\nFearless of personal danger, she ran to his assistance. The child was\nlying motionless on his face; while, with one huge paw laid on his back,\nNeptune was standing over him, wagging his tail in triumph. Convinced\nthat the child was unhurt, and that the scream had been caused merely by\nfear, Laura spoke to the dog, who immediately quitted his posture to\nfawn upon her. She lifted the child from the ground and carried him\ntowards the cottage. The poor little fellow, pale with terror, clung\nround her neck; but he no sooner saw himself in safety, than, recovering\nhis suspended faculties, he began to roar with all his might. His cries\nreached the people in the house, who hastened to inquire into their\ncause; and Laura was met in the door of the cottage by De Courcy's\ngrey-haired servant, John, who seemed its owner, and a decent old woman,\nwho was his wife.\n\nLaura prefaced her account of the accident by an assurance that the\nchild was not hurt, and the old woman, taking him in her arms, tried to\nsooth him, while John invited Miss Montreville to enter. She followed\nhim into a room, which, unacquainted as she was with the cleanliness of\nthe English cottages, appeared to her quite Arcadian. While Margaret was\nbusy with her little charge, Laura praised the neatness and comfort of\nJohn's abode. 'It is as snug a place as heart can desire, please you,\nMa'am,' answered John, visibly gratified; 'and we have every thing here\nas convenient as in the king's palace, or as my master himself has, for\nthe matter of that.' 'I thought, John, you had lived in Mr De Courcy's\nhouse,' said Laura. 'Yes, please you, Ma'am, and so I did, since I was a\nlittle fellow no higher than my knee, taken in to run messages, till my\nyoung master came of age, and then he built this house for me, that I\nmight just have it to go to when I pleased, without being turned away\nlike; for he knew old folks liked to have a home of their own. So now,\nof a fine evening, I come home after prayers, and stay all night; and\nwhen it's bad weather, I have the same bed as I have had these forty\nyears; not a penny worse than my master's own.' 'And if you are employed\nall day at Norwood,' said Laura, 'how do you contrive to keep your\ngarden in such nice order?' 'Oh! for the matter of that, Ma'am, my\nmaster would not grudge me a day's work of the under gardener any time;\nno, nor to pay a man to work the little patch for me; but only, as he\nsays, the sweetest flowers are of one's own planting, so, of a fine day\nhe often sends me home for an hour or two in the cool, just to put the\nlittle place in order.' 'Mr De Courcy seems attentive to the comfort of\nevery body that comes near him,' said Laura. 'That he is, Madam; one\nwould think he had an affection, like, for every mortal creature, and\nparticularly when they grow old and useless, like me and Margaret. I\nknow who offered him twenty pounds a-year for this house and the bit of\nfield; but he said old folks did not like moving, and he would not put\nus out of this, even though he could give us one twice as good.' 'And\nyour rent is lower than twenty pounds, I suppose?' said Laura. 'Why\nsure, Ma'am, we never pay a penny for it. My master,' said John, drawing\nup his head, and advancing his chest, 'my master has the proper true\nspirit of a gentleman, and he had it since ever he was born; for it's\nbred in the bone with him, as the saying is. Why, Ma'am, he had it from\na child.--I have seen him, when he was less than that boy there, give\naway his dinner when he was as hungry as a hound, just because a beggar\nasked it.--Ay, I remember, one day, just two-and-twenty years ago come\nJuly, that he was sitting at the door on my knee, eating his breakfast,\nand he had asked it half a dozen times from Mrs Martin, for he was very\nhungry; and she did not always attend to him very well. So, up came a\nwoman leading a little ragged creature; and it looked at Master\nMontague's bread and milk, and said, 'I wish I had some too.' So, says\nmy master, \"here take you some, and I'll take what you leave.\"--Well,\nMa'am, the brat snapped it up all in a trice, and I waited to see what\nlittle master would do.--Well, he just laughed as good naturedly! Then I\nwas going to have got him another breakfast, but my Lady would not let\nme. \"No, No, John!\" said my Lady, \"we must teach Montague the connection\nbetween generosity and self-denial.\"--These were my Lady's very words.'\n\nBy this time Margaret had succeeded in quieting the child; and a double\nallowance of bread and butter restored all his gaiety. 'Come, Nep,' said\nhe, squatting himself on the ground where Neptune was lying at Laura's\nfeet; 'come, Nep, I'll make friends; and there's half for you, Henry's\nown dear Nep.' 'Will you sit upon my knee?' said Laura, who was\nextremely fond of children. The boy looked steadily in her face for a\nfew moments, and then holding out his arms to her, said, 'Yes, I will.'\n'Whose charming child is this?' inquired Laura, twisting his golden\nringlets round her fingers. The colour rose to old Margaret's furrowed\ncheek as she answered, 'He is an orphan, Ma'am.'--'He is our grandson,'\nsaid John, and drew his hand across his eyes. Laura saw that the subject\nwas painful, and she inquired no further. She remained for a while\nplaying with little Henry, and listening to John's praises of his\nmaster; and then returned homewards.\n\nShe was met by De Courcy and Harriet, who were coming in search of her.\nShe related her little adventure, and praised the extraordinary beauty\nof the child. 'Oh, that's Montague's proteg\u00c3\u00a9!' cried Harriet. 'By the by\nhe has not been to visit us since you came; I believe he was never so\nlong absent before since he could see. I have a great notion my brother\ndid not want to produce him to you.'--'To me!' exclaimed Laura in\nsurprise; 'Why not?' But receiving no answer from Harriet, who had been\neffectually silenced by a look from De Courcy, she turned for\nexplanation to Montague; who made an awkward attempt to laugh off his\nsister's attack, and then as awkwardly changed the subject.\n\nFor some minutes Laura gravely and silently endeavoured to account for\nhis behaviour. 'His generosity supports this child,' thought she, 'and\nhe is superior to blazoning his charity.' So having, as great\nphilosophers have done, explained the facts to agree with her theory,\nshe was perfectly satisfied, and examined them no more. Association\ncarrying her thoughts to the contemplation of the happiness which De\nCourcy seemed to diffuse through every circle where he moved, she\nregretted that she was so soon to exchange the enjoyment of equable\nunobtrusive kindness, for starts of officious fondness mingling with\nintervals of cold neglect or peevish importunity.\n\n'Norwood is the Eden of the earth,' said she to Harriet, as they drew\ntheir chairs towards the fire, to enjoy a _t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate_ after the family\nwere retired for the night; 'and it is peopled with spirits fit for\nparadise.--Happy you, who need never think of leaving it!' 'Bless you,\nmy dear,' cried Harriet, 'there is nothing I think of half so much.--You\nwould not have me be an old maid to comb lapdogs and fatten cats, when I\nmight be scolding my own maids and whipping my own children.' 'Really,'\nsaid Laura, 'I think you would purchase even _these_ delightful\nrecreations too dearly by the loss of your present society. Sure it were\na mad venture to change such a blessing for any uncertainty!' 'And yet,\nMrs Graveairs, I have a notion that a certain gallant soldier could\ninspire you with the needful daring.--Now, look me in the face, and deny\nit if you can.' Laura did as she was desired; and, with cheeks flushed\nto crimson, but a voice of sweet austere composure, replied, 'Indeed,\nMiss De Courcy, I am hurt that you should so often have taxed me, even\nin sport, with so discreditable a partiality. You cannot be serious in\nsupposing that I would marry an'--adulterer, Laura would have said; but\nto apply such an epithet to Hargrave was too much for human firmness,\nand she stopped. 'I declare she is angry,' cried Harriet. 'Well, my\ndear, since it displeases you, I shan't tease you any more; at least not\ntill I find a new subject. But, pray now, do you intend to practise as\nyou preach. Have you made a vow never to marry?' 'I do not say so,'\nanswered Laura; 'it is silly to assert resolutions which nobody credits.\nBesides my situation sadly differs from yours. Like the moon, that is\nrising yonder, I must pursue my course alone. Thousands around me might\nperhaps warm and enlighten me; but far distant, their influence is lost\nere it reaches me. You are in the midst of a happy family, endeared to\nyou by all that is lovely in virtue; all that is sacred in kindred.--I\nknow not what would tempt me to resign your situation.'--'What would\ntempt you?' cried Harriet. 'Why a pretty fellow would. But I verily\nbelieve you have been taking your cue from Montague; these are precisely\nhis ideas. I think he has set his heart upon making me lead apes.' 'What\nmakes you think so?' inquired Laura. 'Because he finds out a hundred\nfaults to every man that talks nonsense to me. One is poor; and he\nthinks it folly to marry a beggar. Another is old, though he's rich; and\nthat would be downrightly selling myself. One's a fool, and t'other's\ncross; and in short there's no end to his freaks. Only the other day he\nmade me dismiss a creature that I believe I should have liked well\nenough in time. I have not half forgiven him for it yet. Poor\nWilmot--and I should have had a nice barouche too!' 'What could possibly\nweigh with your brother against the barouche?' said Laura, smiling.\n'Why, my dear, the saucy wretch told me, as plainly as he civilly could,\nthat Wilmot and I had not a grain of prudence between us; ergo, that we\nshould be ridiculous and miserable. Besides, poor Wilmot once persuaded\na pretty girl to play the fool; and though he afterwards did every thing\nhe could to prevail on her to be made an honest woman, the silly thing\nchose rather to break her heart and die; and, ever since, poor Wilmot\nhas been subject to fits of low spirits.' 'Is it possible, Harriet, that\nyou can talk so lightly of a crime so black in its nature, so dreadful\nin its consequences: Can it seem a trifle to you to destroy the peace,\nthe innocence of a fellow-creature? Can you smile at remorse that\npursued its victim even to the grave?' Tears filled the eyes of Harriet.\n'Oh no, my dearest,' she cried, throwing her arms round Laura's neck;\n'do not think so hardly of me.--I am a rattle, it is true, but I am not\nunprincipled.'--'Pardon my injustice, dearest Harriet,' said Laura, 'in\nbelieving, even for a moment, that you were capable of such perversion;\nand join with me in rejoicing that your brother's influence has saved\nyou from witnessing, from sharing, the pangs of unavailing repentance.'\n'Indeed,' said Harriet, 'Montague's influence can do any thing with me;\nand no wonder. I should be the most ungrateful wretch on earth if I\ncould oppose his wishes. I cannot tell you the thousandth part of the\naffection he has shewn me. Did you ever hear, my dear, that my father\nhad it not in his power to make any provision for me?' Laura answered\nthat she had never heard the circumstances of the family at all\nmentioned. 'Do you know,' continued Harriet, 'I am certain that Montague\nis averse to my marrying, because he is afraid that my poverty, and not\nmy will, consents. But he has himself set that matter to rest; for the\nvery morning after I gave Wilmot his _cong\u00c3\u00a9_, Montague presented me with\nbills for two thousand pounds. The generous fellow told me that he did\nnot offer his gift while Wilmot's suit was pending, lest I should think\nhe bought a right to influence my decision.' 'This is just what I should\nhave expected from Mr De Courcy,' said Laura, the purest satisfaction\nbeaming in her countenance. 'He is ever considerate, ever generous.' 'To\ntell you that he gives me money,' cried Harriet, rapturously, 'is\nnothing; he gives me his time, his labour, his affection. Do love him,\ndear Laura! He is the best of all creatures!' 'Indeed I believe it,'\nsaid Laura, 'and I have the most cordial regard for him.'--'Ah but you\nmust'--Harriet's gratitude to her brother had very nearly been too\nstrong for his secret, and she was on the point of petitioning Laura to\nreturn a sentiment warmer than cordial regard, when, recollecting her\nmother's commands, she desisted; and to fly from the temptation, wished\nLaura good night, and retired.\n\nIt was with sincere regret that Laura, the next day, took leave of her\nkind hosts. As De Courcy handed her into the carriage, the tears were\nrising to her eyes: but they were checked by a glance from Lady Pelham,\nin which Laura thought she could read mingled scorn and anger. Lady\nPelham had remarked the improved spirits of her niece; but, instead of\nrejoicing that any medicine should have 'ministered to a mind diseased,'\nshe was offended at the success of a remedy applied by any other than\nherself. She was nettled at perceiving that the unobtrusive seriousness\nof Mrs De Courcy, and the rattling gaiety of Harriet, had effected what\nall her brilliant powers had not achieved. Her powers, indeed, had been\nsometimes directed to entertain, but never to console; they had been\nexerted to purchase admiration, not to win confidence; yet, with a\ncommon perverseness, she was angry at their ill success, not sorry for\ntheir wrong direction. She did not consider, that real benevolence, or\nan excellent counterfeit, is the only road to an unadulterated heart. It\nappeared to her a proof of an ungrateful temper in her niece, that she\nshould yield in so short a time to strangers to whom she owed nothing,\nwhat she refused to a relation to whom she owed so much. She had been\nunable to forbear from venting her spleen in little spiteful remarks,\nand sly stings, sometimes so adroitly given, that they were unobserved,\nexcept by the person who was by degrees becoming accustomed to expect\nthem. The presence of the De Courcy family, however, restrained the\nexpression of Lady Pelham's ill humour; and, as she detested restraint,\n(a detestation which she always ascribed to a noble ingenuousness of\nmind), she nestled, with peculiar complacency, into the corner of the\ncarriage which was to convey her to what she called freedom, namely, the\nliberty to infringe, with impunity, the rights of others. Laura felt\nthat her reluctance to quit Norwood was a bad compliment to her aunt,\nand she called a smile to her face as she kissed her hand to her kind\nfriends; yet the contrast between their affectionate looks, and the\n'lurking devil' in Lady Pelham's eye, did not lessen her regret at the\nexchange she was making.\n\nLady Pelham saw the tone of Laura's mind, and she immediately struck up\na discord. 'Heaven be praised,' she cried, 'we have at last escaped out\nof that stupid place! I think it must be something extraordinary that\ntempts me to spend four days there again.' Laura remained silent; for\nshe disliked direct contradiction, and never spoke what she did not\nthink. Lady Pelham continued her harangue, declaring, 'that your good\nsort of people were always intolerably tiresome; that clock-work\nregularity was the dullest thing in nature; that Norwood was another\ncave of Trophonius; Mrs De Courcy inspired with the soul of a starched\nold maid; Harriet animated by the joint spirit of a magpie and a monkey;\nand Montague by that of a methodist parson.' Finally, she again\ncongratulated herself on her escape from such society, and wondered how\nany body could submit to it without hanging himself. Laura was\naccustomed to support Lady Pelham's attacks upon herself with perfect\nequanimity; but her temper was not proof against this unjust, this\nunexpected philippic against her friends; and she reddened with anger\nand disdain, though she had still so much self-command as to reply only,\n'Your Ladyship is fortunate in being able to lose, without regret, what\n_others_ find it so difficult to replace.'\n\nLady Pelham fully understood the emphasis which was laid on the word\n_others_, but the mortification to her vanity was compensated by the\ntriumph of discovering the vulnerable side of her niece's temper. This\nwas the first time that she had been conscious of power over it, and\nseverely did Laura pay for the momentary negligence which had betrayed\nthe secret. Some persons never feel pleasure without endeavouring to\ncommunicate it. Lady Pelham acted upon the converse of this amiable\nprinciple; and, as an ill-regulated mind furnished constant sources of\npain, a new channel of participation was a precious discovery. As often,\ntherefore, as spleen, jealousy, or malice prompted her to annoyance, she\nhad recourse henceforth to this new-found weapon; and she varied her\nwarfare through all the changes of hints, insinuations, and that mode of\nattack the most provoking of all, which, aiming at no particular point,\nbecomes the more difficult to parry. During several months, she made it\nthe occasional instrument of her vengeance for the jealousy which she\nentertained of Laura's increasing intimacy with the De Courcys; an\nintimacy which she chose to embitter, though she could not break it off,\nwithout depriving herself of acquaintances who were visited by the first\npeople in the county.\n\nHer industry in teazing was not confined to Laura. She inflicted a\ndouble stroke, by the petulance or coldness with which she sometimes\ntreated the De Courcys. But though Laura was keenly sensible to these\npetty wrongs done her friends, the injury passed them over without much\nnotice. Harriet repaid them with laughter or sarcasm; while Montague\nseemed to consider them as wholly unworthy of attention. He continued\nhis visits to Walbourne, and accident at last furnished an excuse for\ntheir frequency.\n\nIn the course of Lady Pelham's improvements, a difficulty chanced to\noccur, which a slight knowledge of the elements of mathematics would\nhave enabled her to solve. To supply the want of this knowledge, she had\nrecourse to Mr De Courcy, who removed her perplexity with the ease of\none conversant with his subject, and the accuracy of one who speaks to a\nreasoning creature. Lady Pelham was charmed! She was convinced that 'of\nall studies that of mathematics must be the most delightful. She\nimagined it might not be quite impracticable even for a lady, supposing\nshe were so fortunate as to meet with a friend who could assist her.' De\nCourcy, laughing, offered his services, not, it must be owned, with any\nidea that they would be accepted. Her Ladyship, however, eagerly\nembraced the offer; for she was little accustomed to forecast the\ndifficulties of any scheme that entered her brain. In this triumphant\nexpectation that all difficulty would yield to her acuteness, and her\nbrighter abilities gain in a comparison with the plain good-sense of her\nniece, she obliged Laura to join her in this new pursuit. Upon the study\nof this science, so little in favour with a sex who reserve cultivation\nfor faculties where it is least wanting, Laura entered with a pleasure\nthat surprised herself, and she persevered in it with an industry that\nastonished her teacher. Lady Pelham was, for a little while, the\ncompanion of her labours; but, at the first difficulty, she took offence\nat the unaccommodating thing, which shewed no more indulgence to female\nthan to royal indolence.--Forthwith she was fired with a strong aversion\nto philosophers in bibs, and a horror at she-pedants, a term of reproach\nwhich a dexterous side-glance could appropriate to her niece, though the\nauthor of those memoirs challenges any mortal to say that ever Laura\nMontreville was heard to mention ellipse or parabola, or to insinuate\nher acquaintance with the properties of circle or polygon. Nothing moved\nby Lady Pelham's sneers, Laura continued her studies, impelled partly by\nthe duty of improving the most valuable faculty of an immortal mind,\npartly by the pleasure which she derived from the study itself. It is\ntrue, that her Ladyship's indiscreet use of the secret, made Laura's\nlabours the cause of much merriment to titterers of both sexes; but we\nhave never discovered that De Courcy esteemed her the less for her\npersevering industry, or loved her the less for this new subject of\nmutual interest. He watched with delight the restoration of her mind to\nits full vigour; and as he had never known her in the blaze of youthful\ngaiety, he was scarcely sensible of the shade which blended the radiance\nof her mid-day of life with the sober tints of evening.\n\nThe impression of her early disappointment was indeed indelible, but it\nwas no longer overwhelming. She had given the reins to her\nimagination--it had fatally misled her; but its power had sustained an\nirrecoverable shock, and the sway was transferred to reason. She had\ndreamed of an earthly heaven, and seen that it was but a dream. All her\nearthly joys had vanished--yet misery had been almost as transient as\ndelight, and she learned the practical use of a truth which all\nacknowledge in theory. In the course of four months residence at\nWalbourne, she recovered a placid cheerfulness, which afterwards\ncontinued to be the habitual tenor of her mind. If she looked forward to\nthe future events of her life, it was to resolve that they should be\nsubservient to the great end of her being. If she glanced backward, it\nwas less to lament her disappointment, than to blame the error which had\nled to it; and she never allowed her thoughts to dwell upon her unworthy\nlover, except when praying that he might be awakened to a sense of his\nguilt.\n\nShe was chiefly concerned to improve and to enjoy the present; and in\nthis she was successful in spite of the peevish humours of Lady Pelham,\nmixed occasionally with ebullitions of rage. Those who are furious where\nthey dare, or when the provocation is sufficient to rouse their courage,\nsometimes chide with impotent perseverance where they are awed from the\nfull expression of their fury: as the sea, which the lightest breeze\ndashes in billows over the sandbank, frets in puny ripples against the\nrock that frowns over it. If Lady Pelham's temper had any resemblance to\nthis stormy element, it was not wholly void of likeness to another--for\nit 'changed as it listed,' without any discoverable reason. It would\nhave lost half its power to provoke, and Laura half the merit of her\npatient endurance, if it had been permanently diabolical. The current,\nnot only serene but sparkling, would reflect with added beauty every\nsurrounding object, then would suddenly burst into foam, or settle into\na stagnant marsh. Laura threw oil upon the torrent, and suffered the\nmarsh to clear itself. She enjoyed Lady Pelham's wit and vivacity in her\nhours of good humour, and patiently submitted to her seasons of low\nspirits, as she complaisantly called them.\n\nLaura at last, undesignedly, opened a new direction to her aunt's\nspleen. From her first introduction to Lady Pelham, she had laboured\nassiduously to promote a reconciliation between her aunt and her\ndaughter, Mrs Herbert. Her zeal appeared surprising to Lady Pelham, who\ncould not estimate the force of her motive for thus labouring, to the\nmanifest detriment of her own interest, she being (after Mrs Herbert)\nthe natural heiress of her aunt's fortune. She had seized the moment of\ncomplacency; watched the relentings of nature; by turns tried to sooth\nand to convince; and, in the proper spirit of a peace-maker, adhered to\nher purpose with meek perseverance. According to the humour of the\nhour, Lady Pelham was alternately flattered by solicitations that\nconfessed her power, or rendered peevish by entreaties which she was\ndetermined to reject, or fired to rage by the recollection of her\nwrongs. If the more placid frame prevailed, she could ring eternal\nchanges on the same oft-refuted arguments, or adroitly shift the subject\nby some lively sally of wit, or some neat compliment to her niece. In\nher more stormy tempers, she would profess a total inability to pardon;\nnay, a determination never to attempt it; and took credit for scorning\nto pretend a forgiveness which she could not practise.\n\nStill Laura was not discouraged: for she had often observed that what\nLady Pelham declared on one day to be wholly impossible, on the next\nbecame, without any assignable reason, the easiest thing in nature; and\nthat what to-day no human force could wrest from her, was yielded\nto-morrow to no force at all. She therefore persisted in her work of\nconciliation; and her efforts at last prevailed so far, that, though\nLady Pelham still protested implacability, she acknowledged, that, as\nthere was no necessity for her family feuds being known to the world,\nshe was willing to appear upon decent terms with the Herberts; and, for\nthat purpose, would receive them for a few weeks at Walbourne.\n\nOf this opening, unpromising as it was, Laura instantly availed herself;\nand wrote to convey the frozen invitation to her cousin, in the kindest\nlanguage which she was permitted to use. It was instantly accepted; and\nMrs Herbert and her husband became the inmates of Walbourne.\n\nMrs Herbert had no resemblance to her mother. Her countenance was grave\nand thoughtful; her manners uniformly cold and repulsive. Laura traced\nin her unbending reserve, the apathy of one whose genial feelings had\nbeen blunted by early unkindness. Frank, high-spirited, and imprudent,\nHerbert was his wife's opposite; and Laura had not been half an hour in\nhis company, before she began to tremble for the effects of these\nqualities on the irascible temper of her aunt. But her alarm seemed\ncauseless; for the easy resoluteness with which he maintained his\nopinions, appeared to extort from Lady Pelham a sort of respect; and,\nthough she privately complained to Laura of what she called his\nassurance, she exempted him, while present, from her attacks, seeming\nafraid to exert upon him her skill in provoking. Laura began to\nperceive, that a termagant is not so untameable an animal as she had\nonce imagined, since one glimpse of the master-spirit is of sovereign\npower to lay the lesser imps of spleen. But though Lady Pelham seemed\nafraid to measure her strength with spirits of kindred irascibility, she\nwas under no restraint with Mrs Herbert, upon whom she vented a degree\nof querulousness that appeared less like the ebullitions of ill-temper,\nthan the overflowings of settled malice. Every motion, every look,\nfurnished matter of censure or of sarcasm. The placing of a book, the\npronunciation of a word, the snuffing of a candle, called forth\nreprehension; and Laura knew not whether to be most astonished at the\ningenious malice which contrived to convert 'trifles light as air,' into\ncertain proofs of degeneracy, or at the apathy on which the venomed\nshaft fell harmless. Mrs Herbert received all her mother's reprimands in\nsilence, without moving a muscle, without announcing, by the slightest\nchange of colour, that the sarcasm had reached further than her ear. If,\nas not unfrequently happened, the reproof extended into a harangue, Mrs\nHerbert unmoved withdrew no part of her attention from her netting, but\npolitely suppressed a yawn.\n\nThese discourteous scenes were exhibited only in Mr Herbert's absence;\nhis presence instantly suspended Lady Pelham's warfare; and Laura\ninferred that his wife never made him acquainted with her mother's\nbehaviour. That behaviour formed an exception to the general\nunsteadiness of Lady Pelham; for to Mrs Herbert she was consistently\ncruel and insulting. Nothing could be more tormenting to the benevolent\nmind of Laura, than to witness this system of aggression; and she\nrepented having been instrumental in renewing an intercourse that could\nlead to no pleasing issue.\n\nBut the issue was nearer than she expected. One day, in Herbert's\nabsence, Lady Pelham began to discuss with his wife, or rather _to_ her,\nthe never-failing subject of her duplicity and disobedience. She was not\ninterrupted by any expression of regret or repentance from the culprit,\nwho maintained a stoical silence, labouring the while to convey\nmathematical precision to the crimping of a baby's cap, an employment\nupon which Lady Pelham seemed to look with peculiar abhorrence. From the\nturpitude of her daughter's conduct, she proceeded to its consequences.\nShe knew no right, she said, that people had to encumber their friends\nwith hosts of beggarly brats. She vowed that none such should ever\nreceive her countenance or protection. Her rage kindled as she spoke.\nShe inveighed against Mrs Herbert's insensibility; and at last talked\nherself into such a pitch of fury, as even to abuse her for submitting\nto the company of one who could not conceal detestation of her;--a want\nof spirit which she directly attributed to the most interested\nviews;--views which, however, she absolutely swore that she would\ndefeat. In the energy of her declamation, she did not perceive that\nHerbert had entered the room, and stood listening to her concluding\nsentences, with a face of angry astonishment. Advancing towards his\nwife, he indignantly inquired the meaning of the tumult. 'Nothing,'\nanswered she, calmly surveying her handywork; 'only my mother is a\nlittle angry, but I have not spoken a word.' He then turned for\nexplanation to Lady Pelham, whom the flashing of his eye reduced to\ninstantaneous quiet; and, not finding, in her stammering abstract of the\nconversation, any apology for the insult which he had heard, he took his\nwife by the arm, and instantly left the house, giving orders that his\nbaggage should follow him to a little inn in the neighbouring village.\nThus did the insolence of one person, and the hasty spirit of another,\nundo what Laura had for months been labouring to effect. The Herberts\nnever made any attempt at reconciliation, and Lady Pelham would never\nafterwards hear them mentioned, without breaking out into torrents of\nabuse, and even imprecation, which made Laura's blood run cold. Yet,\nwith her usual inconsistency, Lady Pelham was vexed at the suspension of\nher intercourse with the Herberts; because she thus lost even the shadow\nof power over her daughter. Not that she acknowledged this cause of\nregret. No! she eloquently bewailed her hard fate, in being exposed to\nthe censure of the world as at variance with her nearest relatives. She\ncomplained that, with a heart 'warm as melting charity,' she had no one\nto love or to cherish. Yet Laura could not always forbear smiling at the\nperverse direction of her aunt's regrets. Lady Pelham was angry, not\nthat her own unkindness had driven her children from her, but that\nLaura's officious benevolence had brought them to her house; a measure\nfrom which, she was pleased to say that no person of common sense could\nhave expected a different issue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nIf Lady Pelham repined at the desertion of the Herberts, it was not\nbecause their departure consigned her to solitude. Never had Walbourne\nattracted so many visitors. Lady Pelham's beautiful niece drew thither\nall the gentlemen of the neighbourhood. The ladies followed them of\ncourse. The beauty and modesty of Laura charmed the men, while the women\nwere half-inclined to think it an unfounded slander that such a\ngood-natured, obliging, neat-handed creature studied mathematics, and\nread Tacitus in the original.\n\nAmong the society to which she was introduced by Lady Pelham, and still\nmore among that in which she mingled at Norwood, Laura met with persons\nof distinguished ability, rank, and politeness. In such company she\nrapidly acquired that ease of address which alone was wanting to make\nher manners as fascinating as they were correct. She grew accustomed to\nfind herself the object of attention, and though no habit could\nreconcile her to the gaze of numbers, she gradually learnt to carry into\nthese lesser occasions, the self-command which distinguished her in more\nimportant concerns. In real modesty and humility she improved every day;\nfor it was the study of her life to improve in them. She retained all\nthe timidity which is the fruit of genuine sensibility and quick\nperception of impropriety, while she lost that bashfulness which owes\nits growth to solitude and inexperience. Her personal charms, too,\nincreased as they approached maturity. The symmetry of her form and\nfeatures was indeed scarcely susceptible of improvement; but added\ngracefulness gave new attractions to her figure; while the soul lent its\nimproving strength and brightness to animate her face with charms which\nmere symmetry knows not.\n\nWith such qualifications Laura could not fail to excite admiration; yet\nnever perhaps did beauty so seldom listen to its own praises. It was\nlabour lost to compliment one who never rewarded the flatterer with one\nsmile of gratified vanity, or repaid him with one complaisant departure\nfrom the simple truth. To the everyday nothings of the common herd she\nlistened with a weariness which politeness could sometimes scarcely\nsuppress. 'Oh would,' thought she, 'that civil nothings, as they are\ncalled, required no answer,--or that one obliging gentleman would\nundertake the labour of replying to the rest!' If addressed in the\nlanguage of common-place compliment by one whom she respected, her look\nof mortification intelligibly said, 'Has then your penetration searched\nme deeper than I know myself, and detected in me the more than childish\nweakness of valuing myself on such distinctions as those you are\npraising?'\n\nLaura had no personal vanity; and therefore it required no effort to\nwithstand such praise. She had more merit in the more strenuous but less\nsuccessful exertions which she made to resist the silent flattery of the\nrespectful glance that awaited her decision, besought her approbation,\nor reflected her sentiments. Sometimes she thought Montague De Courcy an\nadept in this sort of flattery. But more frequently, when administered\nby him, she forgot to call it by that name; and she was the less upon\nher guard against his homage, because it was never offered in any more\npalpable form.\n\nFortified by the advice of his mother, who had convinced him that a\npremature disclosure of his sentiments would be fatal to his hopes, and\naware, that were he even successful with Laura, some further provision\nmust be made for his sister, ere he could with justice increase the\nexpence of his household, he acted with such caution as baffled the\npenetration of common observers. The neighbouring tea-tables were rather\ninclined to consign his affections to a lively young heiress, whose\nestate had formerly been dismembered from that of Norwood; for he had\nflirted with her at a review, and danced with her at the county ball.\nMoreover, the charitable declared, 'that if he was backward it was not\nfor want of encouragement, that Miss allowed herself strange liberties;\nthough, to be sure, heiresses might do any thing.'\n\nIn spite of the lynx eye in detecting embryo passion, which is ascribed\nto the sex, Montague's secret was safe even from Laura herself; or if a\nmomentary suspicion had glanced across her mind, she chid it away with\nself accusations of vanity, and recollections of the ten thousand\nopportunities for a declaration which he had suffered to pass\nunimproved. Besides, Mrs De Courcy had once hinted that Montague's\nlittle fits of melancholy and absence were occasioned by his partiality\nfor a lady whose affections were pre-engaged, and Laura was sure that\nthe hint could not refer to herself. Her humiliating secret, she was\nthankful, was safely lodged in her own breast, and could never be\ndivulged to cover her with mortification.\n\nThat which any effort of imagination can ascribe to the influence of\nCupid, no woman ever attributed to any other power; and if, at any time,\na shade crossed the open countenance of Montague, Laura called to mind\nhis mother's hint, and added to her truly sisterly affection a pity\nwhich lent indescribable softness to her manners towards him. Indeed she\nalways treated him with undisguised regard, and Montague tried to be\nsatisfied. Yet he could not help longing to read, in some inadvertent\nglance, a proof that all the heart was not freely shewn. In vain!--the\nheart was open as the day; and all was there that could delight the\nfriend, but nothing that could satisfy the lover.\n\nHe had, however, none of the temptations of jealousy to betray his\nsecret, for his rivals were neither numerous nor formidable. Laura was\nknown to have no fortune; she had little talent for chit chat, and still\nless for flattery; thus amid universal admiration and general good-will,\nshe had only two professed adorers--one, who haunted her while present,\ntoasted her when absent, and raved of her charms, both in prose and\nrhime, without ever suffering his pretensions to become so serious as to\nafford her a pretext for seriously repulsing them--the other, a prudent\nelderly widower, who, being possessed of a good fortune, and a\nfull-grown daughter, thought himself entitled to consult his taste\nwithout regard to pecuniary views, and conceived that Laura might be\nuseful to the young lady in the double capacities of companion and\nexample. Laura's answer to his proposals was a firm but gentle refusal,\nwhile she assured him, that she would not abuse his confidence nor\nbetray the trust he had reposed in her. Elderly gentlemen are seldom\ninclined to publish a repulse. The widower never mentioned his even to\nLady Pelham; and Laura, on this occasion, owed to her principle an\nescape from many a tedious remonstrance, and many a covert attack.\n\nThe summer had almost glided away, and Montague continued to fluctuate\nbetween hope and fear, his mother to cherish his hopes and allay his\napprehensions, Laura to be tranquil, Harriet to be gay, and Lady Pelham\nto exhibit, by turns, every various degree of every various humour, when\none morning Miss De Courcy, who had lately returned from a visit to a\ncompanion, accompanied her brother on horseback to Walbourne. Lady\nPelham was, as usual, engaged in her garden, but the visitors had no\nsooner entered the room where Laura sat, then she observed that they\nseemed to have exchanged characters. Harriet looked almost thoughtful,\nwhile the countenance of De Courcy sparkled with unusual animation. He\nwas gay even to restlessness. He offered to give Laura her lesson in\nmathematics; and before it was half over, having completely bewildered\nboth himself and his pupil, he tossed away the book, declaring that he\nnever in his life was so little fit for thinking. Pleasure spoke in\nevery tone of his voice, or sported in his eye when he was silent.\n\nAfter a short visit, enlivened by a hilarity which Laura found more\ninfectious than the gravity of Harriet, he proposed leaving his sister\nwith her friend, while he rode on to call for a gentleman in the\nneighbourhood. 'Begone, then,' cried Laura, gaily, 'for I long to\nquestion Harriet what has given you such enviable spirits this morning.'\n'Ah, she must not betray me,' said De Courcy, half smiling, half\nsighing, 'or I forfeit my only chance of being remembered when I am out\nof sight. If she can be silent, curiosity may perhaps befriend me.' 'How\nvery humble!' cried Laura,--'as if curiosity were the only name you\ncould find for the interest I take in what makes you gay, or Harriet\ngrave!' 'Dear Laura,' said De Courcy, ardently, 'give the cause what\nname you will, if you will but think of me.' Then snatching her lily\nhands, he pressed them to his lips, and the next moment was gone.\n\nConfused, surprised, a little displeased, Laura stood silently revolving\nhis behaviour. He had never before made the slightest approach to\npersonal familiarity. Had her frankness invited the freedom? 'Dear\nLaura!' It was the first time he had ever called her by any name less\nrespectful than Miss Montreville. 'Well, and what then--it were mere\nprudery to be displeased at such a trifle. What,' thought she, 'can have\ndelighted him so much? Perhaps the lady is kind at last. He need not,\nhowever, have vented his transports upon me.' And Laura was a little\nmore angry than before.\n\nDuring her cogitation, Laura forgot that she might apply to her\ncompanion for a solution of the mystery; perhaps she did not even\nrecollect that Harriet was in the room, till happening to turn her head,\nshe met a glance of sly inquisition, which, however, was instantly\nwithdrawn. Harriet made no comment on the subject of her observation.\n'The man is as much elated,' cried she, 'as if I were five-and-forty,\nand had never had a lover before.'\n\n'You, my dear Harriet,' exclaimed Laura, instantly recovering her good\nhumour, 'is it a conquest of yours that has pleased Mr De Courcy so\nmuch?' 'Even so,' returned Harriet--'Heigho!'\n\n'I congratulate you: and yet it does not seem to delight you quite so\nmuch as it does your brother.'\n\n'Really Laura I am not sure whether it does or not; so I am come to ask\nyou.'\n\n'Me! Indeed you have too much confidence in my penetration; but you\nhave, fortunately, abler, and more natural advisers. Your mother'--\n\n'Oh, my mother is so cautious, so afraid of influencing me! when to be\ninfluenced is the very thing I want. I do hate caution. Then I can't\ntalk it over with her as I could with you. And then, there's Montague\nwho looks so provokingly pleased; and yet he pretends to prim up his\nmouth, and say, \"really it is a subject on which he neither can, nor\nought to give an opinion.\" Pray, advise me, my dear.'\n\n'What! before I know who the gentleman is; when perhaps you have even no\nright to inform me!'\n\n'Pshaw! nonsense.--It is Bolingbroke. But I believe you have never met\nwith him.' 'So you would have me advise you to marry a man whom I have\nnever seen; for of course that is the advice you want. Had the balance\nlain on the other side, no advice would have been thought necessary.'\n'Poh,' cried Harriet pouting. 'I don't want to be advised to marry him.'\n'Are you sure,' returned Laura, smiling, 'that you know what you\nwant.'--'Saucy girl! I would have you tell me whether I am ever likely\nto marry him!' 'Do you think I am by birth entitled to the second-sight,\nthat I should foresee this before I know any thing of the gentleman's\nmerits, or, what is of more consequence, of their rank in your\nestimation?' 'The man has good legs,' said Harriet, plaiting the fingers\nof her glove with great industry. 'Legs! really, Harriet, I was in hopes\nI had for once found you serious.'--'So I am; my dear; I never was so\nserious before, and hope I never shall again. Yet I don't know what to\nthink; so I shall just tell you honestly how the matter stands, and you\nshall think for me.'\n\n'I will not promise that; but I own I have some curiosity to hear your\n_honest_ confession.'--'Oh you need not peep so archly askance under\nthose long eyelashes; I can stand a direct look, I assure you; for at\nthis moment I have not the slightest preference in the world for\nBolingbroke over half a score of others.' 'Then what room is there for\nhesitation?' 'Why, my dear, in the first place, he has a noble fortune:\nthough that goes for nothing with you; secondly, he is really a good\ncreature, and far from a fool; then, to talk in your style, I have had\nadvantages in observing his temper and dispositions such as I shall\nnever have with any other man; for his sister and I have been companions\nfrom childhood, and I have lived under his roof for months; then, which\nwill weigh with you more than all, he is Montague's particular\nfavourite.' 'Great recommendations these, Harriet; sufficient at least\nto bias any woman who intends to marry. I should like to know Mr\nBolingbroke.' 'Here is his letter, my dear,' said Harriet; 'it came\ninclosed in one to my brother. There is a good deal of the man's turn in\nit.'\n\nLaura took the letter, and read as follows:\n\n     'I will not wrong your penetration so much as to suppose that\n     this letter will surprise you, or that you will fail to\n     anticipate the subject on the first glance at the signature.\n     Nor do I write to tell you, in the hackneyed phrase, that the\n     happiness of my whole life depends upon you, because, next to\n     your affection, nothing is so desirable to me as your esteem,\n     and the hope that, though you should reject my suit, you will\n     continue to respect my understanding. But I may with truth\n     declare, that I prefer you to all women; that I love you, not\n     only in spite of your faults, but, perhaps, even the more for\n     them; and that, to forfeit the hope of your affection, would\n     dispel many a long-cherished vision of domestic peace, and even\n     some lighter dreams of rapture. Dearest Harriet, do not, in\n     return for this confession, write me a cold profession of\n     esteem. I know already that you esteem me, for you have long\n     known me possessed of qualities that inevitably engage esteem;\n     but I am conscious of a deficiency in the gifts that excite\n     passion, and I dread that I may never awaken sentiments like\n     those I feel. Yet it is no small compliment which I offer, when\n     I suppose you superior to the attractions which captivate the\n     vulgar of your sex; and you may value it the more, because it\n     is perhaps the only one I shall ever pay you.\n\n     'To say all this, or something like it, has long been in my\n     thoughts; and, during your late visit to my sister, occupied\n     them more than I shall own; but a dread of I know not what,\n     forced me to let you depart without offering to your acceptance\n     all that I have to offer. I felt a certainty that I was not\n     yet beloved, and, I believe I feared that you, in your lively\n     way, (so I must call it, since no epithet that implies reproof\n     must flow from a lover's pen), would give utterance to the\n     feeling of the moment, and bid me think of you no more. Is it\n     presumption to say, that I hope more from a more considerate\n     decision? Ask your own heart, then, dear Miss De Courcy,\n     whether time and the assiduities of respectful love can beguile\n     you of such tenderness as is due to a confiding affectionate\n     husband. Ask yourself, whether you can ever return my warm\n     attachment, to such a degree as will make the duties of a wife\n     easy and pleasant to you. I need not assure you that I am not\n     the selfish wretch who could find joy in receiving those which\n     were painfully and reluctantly performed. Be candid with\n     yourself then I adjure you. Fear not that I shall persecute you\n     with importunity or complaint. If it must be so, I will see you\n     no more for some months; and, at the end of that time, shall\n     expect, in reward of my self-conquest, to be received with\n     cordiality as your brother's friend. If your sentence be\n     against me, save yourself the pain of telling me so; for I know\n     that it must be painful to you. Yet judge of the strength of\n     that regard which is thus anxious to shield you from\n     uneasiness, at the moment when it anticipates such pain from\n     your hands. If you can give me hope (and, observe, when I say\n     hope, I do not mean certainty), do not tax your delicacy for\n     studied phrases of acceptance, but write me even a common card\n     of invitation to Norwood, and the tenderest billet that ever\n     was penned by woman, never gave more pleasure than it will\n     bring to your very affectionate and obedient servant,\n\n                                 'EDWARD BOLINGBROKE.'\n\nLaura could not help smiling at the composed style of this epistle, so\ndifferent from the only ones of its kind with which she was conversant.\nA lover confess that his mistress had faults, and that he was sensible\nof them!--insinuate that he expected not only duty, but willing and\ngrateful duty from his wife!--have the boldness to expect, that, if his\npassion were unsuccessful, he should quickly be able to conquer it!\nLaura felt no inclination to envy her friend a lover so fully in the\nexercise of his judgment and foresight; but she was pleased with the\nplain honest rationality of the letter; and, with the materials before\nher, immediately busied her imagination in its favourite work of\nsketching and adorning character.\n\nShe was called from her meditation by another petition for advice. 'You\nsee,' said Harriet, 'he pretends not to expect certainty; but it is much\nthe same whether one run one's neck into the noose, or gets entangled so\nthat one can't decently get off. If I could _creditably_ contrive to\nkeep him dangling till I had made up my mind,' continued she,\nillustrating the metaphor with her watch-chain. 'Do assist me, my dear;\nI am sure you have managed a dozen of them in your time.'\n\n'My experience is not so extensive,' replied Laura, 'and I can really\nassist you to no _creditable_ method of trifling.'\n\n'You would not have me resolve to marry a man whom I don't care a\nfarthing for.' 'No, indeed! but I think Mr Bolingbroke would have a\nright to complain, if you gave hopes which you did not fulfil.' 'You\nwould have me dismiss him at once then?' 'By no means; but I would have\nyou think for yourself on a subject of which no other person can judge;\nand remember, my dear, that, as your decision has neither been wrested\nfrom you by surprise, nor seduced from you by persuasion, you have no\nexcuse for forming a weak or wavering resolution.'\n\nDetermined that on such a subject she would deliver no opinion, Laura\nwas relieved from some embarrassment by the return of De Courcy. His\nreflections during his ride had effectually quelled the exuberance of\nhis spirits, and he endeavoured to repair his unguardedness by distant\npoliteness. His manner increased the feeling of restraint of which Laura\ncould not at that time divest herself; and after a short and constrained\nsequel to a visit which had begun so differently, Montague hurried his\nsister away.\n\n'I shall never conquer her indifference,' said he to his mother, after\nrelating the folly of the morning. 'Had you seen her frozen look of\ndispleasure, you would have been convinced.' 'And how, my dear Montague,\ncould you expect Miss Montreville to receive such freedom? like a little\nvillage coquette gasping at the prospect of a first lover? If you are\nconvinced that your secret would still be heard without pleasure, you\nmust redouble your caution to preserve it. But suffer me to warn you\nagainst the extreme of reserve in which I have sometimes observed that\nyou are apt to fall. It can only confirm suspicions if they are excited;\nif not, it will disgust by an appearance of caprice.'\n\nMontague promised to be guarded; and withdrew to seek in his laboratory\na refuge from despondence. Those who pursue worldly gains and vulgar\npleasures, must cheerlessly toil on, waiting for their reward till their\nend is attained; but the pursuits of science and of virtue have this\nadvantage peculiar to themselves, that there is reward in the labour,\neven though the success be only partial; and, in half an hour, all\nMontague's cares were absorbed in the muriatic acid. In a few days he\nagain saw Laura, and her sunny smile of welcome revived hopes which she\nlittle thought of fulfilling.\n\nWhen a woman of ordinary delicacy is brought to hesitate upon the\nproposal of a lover, it is easy, provided prudence be on his side, to\nconjecture how the balance will turn. Mr Bolingbroke received his card\nof invitation to Norwood; and his suit advanced prosperously, though\nslowly. He was a plain unpretending man, seven years at least beyond\nexcuse for any youthful indiscretion, habitually silent, though sure of\ncommanding attention when he spoke. The perfect fairness and integrity\nof his mind had secured him the respect of all his acquaintance in a\ndegree which he appeared to have precisely estimated, and he never\nseemed to expect less or to exact more. His calm unobtrusive manners\nnever captivated a stranger, nor gave offence to an intimate. He was\nkind and generous to a sister, who, twenty years before, had succeeded\nas his play-thing to tops and marbles; and uniformly respectful to a\nmaiden aunt who had, about the same date, replaced his mother as\ndirectress of the family.\n\nHis father had been long dead, and in consequence of his steady\nresistance of all the batteries of charms opened against him, or rather\nagainst his \u00c2\u00a37000 a-year, the ladies had begun to shake their heads, and\npronounce him a determined bachelor. But, notwithstanding their\ndecision, Mr Bolingbroke was resolved to marry, for he considered\nmarriage as one of the duties of his station.\n\nHarriet amused, became customary, pleasing, necessary, to him. 'Our\ndissimilarity will assist us to correct each other's failings,' thought\nhe, and his choice was fixed. He was aware that a grave elderly man\nmight find some difficulty in attaching a volatile girl; and though he\ncould not condescend to flatter even his mistress, he was assiduous to\nplease. He bestowed an infinity of little attentions, which were the\nmore gratifying, because, from a man of his temper, they were wholly\nunexpected. His books, his horses, his carriage, waited but a\nhalf-expressed wish. He planned little excursions and parties of\npleasure, or contrived to add some agreeable surprise to those which\nwere proposed by others. Far from shewing any paltry jealousy, he\ntreated Miss De Courcy's favourites of both sexes with distinguished\npoliteness; and perhaps he owed his success with a heart which had\nwithstood more attractive admirers, partly to the agreeable\nassociations which he found means to raise, partly to vanity, pleased\nwith power over the philosophic Mr Bolingbroke.\n\nMontague watched the progress of his friend with keen interest, but he\nconscientiously avoided influencing Harriet's decision. On the contrary,\nlest the dread of future dependence should weigh with her, he informed\nher, that, should she prefer a single life, or should other\ncircumstances render such a sum important to her, he was determined to\ndouble the little fortune he had already given.\n\nWhile he was anxious to see his sister's happiness secured by her union\nwith an estimable man, he felt that her marriage with Mr Bolingbroke\nwould immediately remove one grand obstacle to his own wishes; for the\nlittle dower which he was determined ere he settled in life to save for\nHarriet, would form an addition altogether insignificant to the splendid\nsettlement which was now in her power. There was nothing Quixotic in the\njustice and generosity of De Courcy; and he had no intention of\nincurring real difficulty and privation for the sake of adding a trifle\nto the stores of affluence. He therefore considered his sister's\nmarriage as leaving him at full liberty to pursue his inclinations with\nregard to Laura, if the time should ever arrive when he could declare\nthem without hazarding the forfeiture of even his present stinted\nmeasure of favour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nOne day Miss De Courcy expressed a wish to shew Laura the collection of\npaintings at a celebrated seat in the neighbourhood. Mr Bolingbroke\nimmediately undertook to procure the permission of the noble owner, who\nwas his relation; and the party was speedily arranged. Mrs Penelope's\nsociable, as Mr Bolingbroke always called it, was to convey his aunt,\nhis sister, Harriet, and Mrs De Courcy, to whom the genial warmth of the\nseason had partially restored the use of her limbs. Mrs Penelope piqued\nherself upon rising with the lark, and enforcing the same wholesome\nhabit upon the whole household; the Bolingbrokes were, therefore, to\ntake an early breakfast at Norwood, and then to proceed on their\nexcursion. De Courcy and Mr Bolingbroke were to ride. Lady Pelham and\nLaura were to join the party in the grounds.\n\nThe weather proved delightful; and, after spending some hours in\nexamining the paintings, in which Laura derived additional pleasure from\nthe skilful comments of De Courcy, the party proceeded to view the\ngrounds, when she, with almost equal delight, contemplated a finished\nspecimen of modern landscape-gardening. Pursuing, as usual, his cautious\nplan, Montague divided his attentions pretty equally between the elder\nladies and Miss Bolingbroke, bestowing the least part upon her for whom\nhe would willingly have reserved all; while Harriet, in good humour with\nherself, and with all around her, frankly gave her arm to her lover; and\nsometimes laughing, sometimes blushing, suffered herself to loiter, to\nincline her head in listening to somewhat said in a half-whisper, and to\nanswer it in an under tone; without recollecting that she had resolved,\ntill she had _quite_ made up her mind, to restrain her habitual\npropensity to flirting.\n\nDe Courcy was certainly above the meanness of envy, yet he could not\nsuppress a sigh as, with Mrs Penelope and his mother leaning on his\narms, while Laura walked behind with Miss Bolingbroke, he followed\nHarriet and his friend into the darkened path that led to a hermitage.\nThe walk was shaded by yew, cypress, and other trees of dusky foliage,\nwhich, closing into an arch, excluded the gaudy sunshine. As they\nproceeded, the shade deepened into twilight, and the heats of noon gave\nplace to refreshing coolness. The path terminated in a porch of\nwicker-work, forming the entrance to the hermitage, the walls of which\nwere composed of the roots of trees, on the outside rugged as from the\nhand of nature, but within polished and fancifully adorned with shells\nand fossils. Opposite to the entrance, a rude curtain of leopard skin\nseemed to cover a recess; and Harriet, hastily drawing it aside, gave to\nview a prospect gay with every variety of cheerful beauty. The meadows,\nlately cleared from their burden, displayed a vivid green, and light\nshadows quickly passed over them and were gone. The corn-fields were\nbusy with the first labours of the harvest. The village spires were\nthickly sown in the distance. More near, a rapid river flashed bright to\nthe sun; yet the blaze came chastened to the eye, for it entered an\nawning close hung with the graceful tendrils of the passion-flower.\n\nThe party were not soon weary of so lovely a landscape, and returning to\nthe more shady apartment, found an elegant collation of fruits and ices,\nsupplied by the gallantry of Mr Bolingbroke. Never was there a more\ncheerful repast. Lady Pelham was luckily in good humour, and therefore\ncondescended to permit others to be so too. Laura, happily for herself,\npossessed a faculty not common to beauties--she could be contented where\nanother was the chief object of attention; and she was actually enjoying\nthe court that was paid to her friend, when, accidentally raising the\nvine leaf which held the fruit she was eating, she observed some verses\npencilled on the rustic table in a hand-writing familiar to her\nrecollection.\n\nSudden instinct made her hastily replace the leaf, and steal a glance to\nsee whether any other eye had followed her's. No one seemed to have\nnoticed her; but Laura's gaiety had vanished. The lines were distinct,\nas if recently traced; and Laura's blood ran chill at the thought, that,\nhad she even a few hours sooner visited this spot, she might have met\nColonel Hargrave. 'He may still be near,' thought she; and she wished,\nthough she could not propose, to be instantly gone. None of her\ncompanions, however, seemed inclined to move. They continued their\nmerriment, while Laura, her mind wholly occupied with one subject,\nagain stole a glimpse of the writing. It was undoubtedly Hargrave's;\nand, deaf to all that was passing around her, she fell into a reverie,\nwhich was first interrupted by the company rising to depart.\n\nThough she had been in such haste to be gone, she was now the last to\ngo. In her momentary glance at the sonnet, she had observed that it was\ninscribed to her. 'Of what possible consequence,' thought she, 'can it\nbe to me?' yet she lingered behind to read it. In language half\npassionate, half melancholy, it complained of the pains of absence and\nthe cruelty of too rigid virtue; but it broke off abruptly, as if the\nwriter had been suddenly interrupted.\n\nSo rapidly did Laura glance over the lines, that her companions had\nadvanced but a few paces, ere she was hastening to follow them. On\nreaching the porch, she saw that the walk was just entered by two\ngentlemen. An instant convinced her that one of them was Hargrave.\nNeither shriek nor exclamation announced this discovery, but Laura,\nturning pale, shrunk back out of view. Her first feeling was eager\ndesire of escape; her first thought, that, returning to the inner\napartment, she might thence spring from the lofty terrace, on the verge\nof which the hermitage was reared. She was deterred, by recollecting the\nabsurd appearance of such an escape, and the surprise it would occasion.\nBut what was to be done? There was no third way of leaving the place\nwhere she stood, and if she remained, in a few moments Hargrave would be\nthere.\n\nThese ideas darted so confusedly through her mind, that it seemed rather\nby instinct than design, that she drew her hat over her face, and\ndoubled her veil in order to pass him unnoticed. She again advanced to\nthe porch; but perceived, not without consternation, that Hargrave had\njoined her party, and stood talking to Lady Pelham in an attitude of\neasy cordiality. Laura did not comment upon the free morality which\naccorded such a reception to such a character; for she was sick at\nheart, and trembled in every limb. Now there was no escape. He would\ncertainly accost her, and she must answer him--answer him without\nemotion! or how would Mr De Courcy--how would his mother construe her\nweakness! What would Hargrave himself infer from it! What, but that her\ncoldness sprung from mere passing anger! or, more degrading still, from\njealousy! The truant crimson now rushed back unbidden; and Laura\nproceeded with slow but steady steps.\n\nDuring her short walk she continued to struggle with herself. 'Let me\nbut this once command myself,' said she. 'And wherefore should I not? It\nis he who ought to shrink.--It is he who ought to tremble!' Yet it was\nLaura who trembled, when, advancing towards her, Lady Pelham introduced\nher to Colonel Hargrave as her niece. Laura's inclination of the head,\ncold as indifference could make it, did not seem to acknowledge former\nintimacy; and when Hargrave, with a manner respectful even to timidity,\nclaimed her acquaintance, she gave a short answer of frozen civility,\nand turned away. Shrinking from even the slightest converse with him,\nshe hastily passed on; then, determined to afford him no opportunity of\nspeaking to her, she glided in between Mrs De Courcy, who stood\nanxiously watching her, and Harriet, who was studying the contour of\nHargrave's face; and offering an arm to each, she gently drew them\nforward.\n\nMr Bolingbroke immediately joined them, and entered into conversation\nwith Harriet; while Mrs De Courcy continued to read the legible\ncountenance of Laura, who silently walked on, revolving in her mind the\ndifference between this and her last unexpected meeting with Hargrave.\nThe freedom of his address to the unfriended girl who was endeavouring\nto exchange the labour of her hands for a pittance to support existence,\n(a freedom which had once found sympathetic excuse in the breast of\nLaura), she now, not without indignation, contrasted with the respect\noffered to Lady Pelham's niece, surrounded by the rich and the\nrespectable. Yet while she remembered what had then been her\nhalf-affected coldness, her ill-restrained sensibility; and compared\nthem with the total alienation of heart which she now experienced, she\ncould not stifle a sigh which rose at the recollection, that in her the\nraptures of love and joy were chilled never more to warm. 'Would that my\npreference had been more justly directed,' thought she, her eye\nunconsciously wandering to De Courcy; 'but that is all over now!'\n\nFrom idle regrets, Laura soon turned to more characteristic meditation\nupon the conduct most suitable for her to pursue. Hargrave had joined\nher party; had been acknowledged, by some of them at least, as an\nacquaintance; and had particularly attached himself to Lady Pelham, with\nwhom he followed in close conversation. Laura thought he would probably\ntake the first opportunity of addressing himself to her; and if her\nmanner towards him corresponded with the bent of her feelings,\nconsciousness made her fear, that in her distance and constraint Lady\nPelham's already suspicious eye would read more than merely dislike to a\nvicious character. Hargrave himself, too, might mistake who so nearly\nresembled her former manner for the veil of her former sentiments. She\nmight possibly escape speaking to him for the present, but if he was\nfixed in the neighbourhood, (and something of the woman whispered that\nhe would not leave it immediately), they would probably meet where to\navoid him was not in her power. After some minutes of close\nconsideration, she concluded, that to treat Colonel Hargrave with easy\ncivil indifference, best accorded with what she owed to her own dignity;\nand was best calculated, if he retained one spark of sensibility or\ndiscernment, to convince him that her sentiments had undergone an\nirrevocable change. This method, therefore, she determined to pursue;\nmaking, with a sigh, this grand proviso, that she should find it\npracticable.\n\nMrs De Courcy, who guessed the current of her thoughts, suffered it to\nproceed without interruption; and it was not till Laura relaxed her\nbrow, and raised her head, like one who has taken his resolution, that\nher companion, stopping, complained of fatigue; proposing, as her own\ncarriage was not in waiting, to borrow Lady Pelham's, and return home,\nleaving the other ladies to be conveyed in Mrs Penelope's sociable to\nNorwood, where the party was to dine. Not willing to direct the proposal\nto Laura, upon whose account chiefly it was made, she then turned to Mrs\nPenelope, and inquired whether she did not feel tired with her walk; but\nthat lady, who piqued herself upon being a hale active woman of her age,\ndeclared herself able for much greater exertion, and would walk, she\nsaid, till she had secured an appetite for dinner. Laura, who had\nmodestly held back till Mrs Penelope's decision was announced, now\neagerly offered her attendance, which Mrs De Courcy, with a little\ndissembled hesitation, accepted, smiling to perceive how well she had\ndivined her young favourite's inclinations.\n\nThe whole party attended them to the spot where the carriages were\nwaiting. On reaching them, Mr Bolingbroke, handing in Mrs De Courcy,\nleft Laura's side for the first time free to Hargrave, who instantly\noccupied it; while Montague, the drops standing on his forehead, found\nhimself shackled between Mrs Penelope and Miss Bolingbroke. 'Ever dear,\never revered Miss Montreville'--Hargrave began in an insinuating\nwhisper. 'Sir!' cried Laura, starting with indignant surprise. 'Nay,\nstart not,' continued he in an under voice; 'I have much, much to say.\nLady Pelham allows me to visit Walbourne; will you permit me to'--Laura\nhad not yet studied her lesson of easy civility, and therefore the\ncourtesy of a slight inclination of the head was contradicted by the\ntone in which she interrupted him, saying, 'I never presume, Sir, to\nselect Lady Pelham's visitors.'\n\nShe had reached the door of the carriage, and Hargrave took her hand to\nassist her in entering. Had Laura been prepared, she would have suffered\nhim, though reluctantly, to do her this little service; but he took her\nunawares, and snatching back her hand as from the touch of a loathsome\nreptile, she sprang, unassisted, into her seat.\n\nAs the carriage drove off, Mrs De Courcy again apologized for separating\nLaura from her companions; 'though I know not,' added she, 'whether I\nshould not rather take credit for withdrawing you from such dangerous\nsociety. All ladies who have stray hearts must guard them either in\nperson or by proxy, since this formidable Colonel Hargrave has come\namong us.' 'He has fortunately placed the more respectable part of us in\nperfect security,' returned Laura, with a smile and voice of such\nunembarrassed simplicity as fully satisfied her examiner.\n\nHad Laura spent a lifetime in studying to give pain, which, indeed, was\nnot in all her thoughts, she could not have inflicted a sharper sting on\nthe proud heart of Hargrave, than by the involuntary look and gesture\nwith which she quitted him. The idea of inspiring with disgust, unmixed\nirresistible disgust, the woman upon whose affections, or rather upon\nwhose passions, he had laboured so zealously and so long, had ever been\nmore than he could bear, even when the expression of her dislike had no\nwitness; but now she had published it to chattering misses and prying\nold maids, and more favoured rivals. Hargrave bit his lip till the blood\ncame; and, if the lightning of the eye could scathe, his wrath had been\nfar more deadly to others.\n\nAfter walking for some minutes surly and apart, he began to comfort\nhimself with the hopes of future revenge. 'She had loved him,\npassionately loved him, and he was certain she could not be so utterly\nchanged. Her behaviour was either all affectation, or a conceit of the\nstrength of her own mind, which all these clever women were so vain of.\nBut the spark still lurked somewhere, whatever she might imagine, and if\nhe could turn her own weapons against herself.'--Then, recollecting that\nhe had resolved to cultivate Lady Pelham, he resumed his station by her\nside, and was again the courtly, insinuating Colonel Hargrave.\n\nHargrave had lately acquired a friend, or rather an adviser (the\ndissolute have no friends), who was admirably calculated to supply the\ndeficiencies of his character as a man of pleasure. Indeed, except in so\nfar as pleasure was his constant aim, no term could, with less justice,\nhave been applied to Hargrave; for his life was chiefly divided between\nthe goadings of temptations to which he himself lent arms, and the pangs\nof self-reproach which he could not exclude, and would not render\nuseful. The strait and narrow way he never had a thought of treading,\nbut his wanderings were more frequent than he intended, his returns more\nlingering. The very strength of his passions made him incapable of deep\nor persevering deceit; he was humane to the suffering that pressed\nitself on his notice, if it came at a convenient season; and he was\ndisinterested, if neglect of gold deserve the name. Lambert, his new\nadviser, had no passions, no humanity, no neglect of gold. He was a\ngamester.\n\nThe practice of this profession, for, though a man of family and fortune\nhe made it a profession, had rendered him skilful to discern, and\nremorseless to use the weaknesses of his fellow creatures. His estate\nlay contiguous to --, the little town where Hargrave had been quartered\nwhen he visited at Norwood; but the year which Hargrave passed at -- was\nspent by Lambert almost entirely alone in London. He had returned\nhowever to the country, had been introduced to Hargrave, and had just\nfixed upon him as an easy prey, when the soldier was saved for a time,\nby receiving intimation of his promotion, and orders to join his\nregiment in a distant county.\n\nThey met again in an evil hour, just as Hargrave had half-determined to\nabandon as fruitless his search after Laura. The necessity of a\nstimulant was as strong as ever. Another necessity too was strong, for\n\u00c2\u00a310,000 of damages had been awarded to Lord Bellamer; Hargrave could not\neasily raise the money, and Lord Lincourt refused to advance a shilling.\n'A pretty expensive pleasure has this Lady Bellamer been to me,' said\nHargrave, bestowing on her Ladyship a coarse enough epithet; for even\nfine gentlemen will sometimes call women what they have found them to\nbe. He was prevailed on to try the gaming-table for the supply of both\nhis wants, and found that pleasure fully twice as expensive. His friend\nintroduced him to some of those accommodating gentlemen who lend money\nat illegal interest, and was generous enough to supply him when they\nwould venture no more upon an estate in reversion. Lambert had\naccidentally heard of the phoenix which had appeared at Walbourne; and,\non comparing the description he received of her with that to which with\npolitic patience he had often listened, he had no doubt of having found\nthe object of Hargrave's search. But, as it did not suit his present\nviews that the lover should renew the pursuit, he dropt not a hint of\nhis discovery, listening, with a gamester's insensibility, to the\nregrets which burst forth amidst the struggles of expiring virtue, for\nher whose soft influence would have led to peace and honour.\n\nAt last a dispute arising between the worthy Mr Lambert and his\nrespectable coadjutors, as to the partition of the spoil, it occurred to\nhim that he could more effectually monopolize his prey in the country;\nand thither accordingly he was called by pressing business. There he was\npresently so fortunate as to discover a Miss Montreville, on whose\ncharms he descanted in a letter to Hargrave in such terms, that, though\nhe averred she could not be Hargrave's Miss Montreville, Hargrave was\nsure she could be no other; and, as his informer expected, arrived in\n----shire as soon as a chaise and four could convey him thither.\n\nLambert had now a difficult game to play, for he had roused the leading\npassion, and the collateral one could act but feebly; but they who often\ntread the crooked path, find pleasure in its intricacy, vainly\nconceiting that it gives proof of their sagacity, and Lambert looked\nwith pleasure on the obstacles in his way. He trusted, that while the\nmaster-spirit detained Hargrave within the circle of Walbourne, he might\ndexterously practise with the lesser imp of evil.\n\nHad his letter afforded a clue to Laura's residence, Hargrave would have\nflown directly to Walbourne, but he was first obliged to stop at --; and\nLambert, with some difficulty, persuaded him, that, as he was but\nslightly known to Lady Pelham, and probably in disgrace with her\nproteg\u00c3\u00a9e, it would be more politic to delay his visit, and first meet\nthem at Lord --'s, where he had information that they were to go on the\nfollowing day. 'You will take your girl at unawares,' said he, 'if she\nbe your girl; and that is no bad way of feeling your ground.' The vanity\nof extorting from Laura's surprise some unequivocal token of his power\nprevailed on the lover to delay the interview till the morning; and,\nafter spending half the evening in dwelling upon the circumstances of\nhis last unexpected meeting with her, which distance softened in his\nimagination to more than its actual tenderness, he, early in the morning\nset out with Lambert for --, where he took post in the hermitage, as a\nplace which no stranger omitted to visit.\n\nGrowing weary of waiting, he dispatched Lambert as a scout; and, lest he\nshould miss Laura, remained himself in the hermitage, till his emissary\nbrought him information that the party were in the picture gallery.\nThither he hastened; but the party had already left the house, and thus\nhad Laura accidental warning of his approach. No reception could have\nbeen so mortifying to him, who was prepared to support her sinking under\nthe struggle of love and duty, of jealousy and pride. No struggle was\nvisible; or, if there was, it was but a faint strife between native\ncourtesy and strong dislike. He had boasted to Lambert of her\ntenderness; the specimen certainly was not flattering. Most of her\ncompanions were little more gracious. De Courcy paid him no more\nattention than bare civility required.--With the Bolingbrokes he was\nunacquainted, but the character of his companion was sufficient reason\nfor their reserve. Lady Pelham was the only person present who soothed\nhis wounded vanity. Pleased with the prospect of unravelling the mystery\ninto which she had pried so long in vain, charmed with the easy\ngallantry and adroit flattery of which Hargrave, in his cooler moments,\nwas consummate master, she accepted his attentions with great\ncordiality; while he had the address tacitly to persuade her that they\nwere a tribute to her powers of entertaining.\n\nBefore they parted, she had converted her permission to visit Walbourne\ninto a pressing invitation, nay, had even hinted to De Courcy the\npropriety of asking the Colonel to join the dinner party that day at\nNorwood. The hint, however, was not taken; and therefore, in her way\nhome, Lady Pelham indulged her fellow-travellers with sundry moral and\ningenious reflections concerning the folly of being 'righteous over\nmuch;' and on the alluring accessible form of the true virtue,\ncontrasted with the repulsive, bristly, hedgehog-like make of the false.\nIndeed, it must be owned, that for the rest of the evening her\nLadyship's conversation was rather sententious than agreeable; but the\nrest of the party, in high good humour, overlooked her attacks, or\nparried them in play.\n\nMontague had watched the cold composure of Laura on Hargrave's first\naccosting her, and seen the gesture which repulsed him at parting; and\nthough in the accompanying look he lost volumes, his conclusions, on the\nwhole, were favourable. Still a doubt arose, whether her manner sprung\nnot from the fleeting resentment of affection; and he was standing\nmournfully calculating the effects of Hargrave's perseverance, when his\nmother, in passing him as she followed her guests to the eating-room,\nsaid, in an emphatical whisper, 'I am satisfied. There is no worm in the\nbud.'\n\nMrs De Courcy's encouraging assertion was confirmed by the behaviour of\nLaura herself; for she maintained her usual serene cheerfulness; nor\ncould even the eye of love detect more than one short fit of\ndistraction; and then the subject of thought seemed any thing rather\nthan pleasing retrospect, or glad anticipation. The company of his\nfriends, Harriet's pointedly favourable reception of Mr Bolingbroke's\nassiduities, and the rise of his own hopes, all enlivened Montague to\nunusual vivacity, and led him to a deed of daring which he had often\nprojected, without finding courage to perform it. He thought, if he\ncould speak of Hargrave to Laura, and watch her voice, her eye, her\ncomplexion, all his doubts would be solved. With this view, contriving\nto draw her a little apart, he ventured, for the first time, to name his\nrival; mentioned Lady Pelham's hint; and, faltering, asked Laura whether\nhe had not done wrong in resisting it.\n\n'Really,' answered Laura with a very _na\u00c3\u00afve_ smile, and a very faint\nblush, 'I don't wonder you hesitate in offering me such a piece of\nflattery as to ask my opinion.'\n\n'Do not tax me with flattering you,' said De Courcy earnestly; 'I would\nas soon flatter an apostle; but tell me candidly what you think.'\n\n'Then, candidly,' said Laura, raising her mild unembarrassed eye to his,\n'I think you did right, perfectly right, in refusing your countenance to\na person of Colonel Hargrave's character. While vice is making her\nencroachments on every hand, it is not for the friends of virtue to\nremove the ancient landmarks.'\n\nThough this was one of the stalest pieces of morality that ever Montague\nhad heard Laura utter, he could scarcely refrain from repaying it by\nclasping her to his heart. Convinced that her affections were free, he\ncould not contain his rapture, but exclaimed, 'Laura, you are an angel!\nand, if I did not already love beyond all power of expression, I should\nbe'--He raised his eyes to seek those of Laura, and met his mother's,\nfixed on him with an expression that compelled him to silence.--'You\nshould be in love with me;' said Laura, laughing, and filling up the\nsentence as she imagined it was meant to conclude. 'Well, I shall be\ncontent with the second place.'\n\nMrs De Courcy, who had approached them, now spoke on some indifferent\nsubject, and saved her son from a very awkward attempt at explanation.\nShe drew her chair close to Laura, and soon engaged her in a\nconversation so animated, that Montague forgot his embarrassment, and\njoined them with all his natural ease and cheerfulness. The infection of\nhis ease and cheerfulness Laura had ever found irresistible. Flashes of\nwit and genius followed the collision of their minds; and the unstudied\neloquence, the poetic imagery of her style, sprung forth at his touch,\nlike blossoms in the steps of the fabled Flora.\n\nHappy with her friends, Laura almost forgot the disagreeable adventure\nof the morning; and, every look and word mutually bestowing pleasure,\nthe little party were as happy as affection and esteem could make them,\nwhen Lady Pelham, with an aspect like a sea fog, and a voice suitably\nforbidding, inquired whether her niece would be pleased to go home, or\nwhether she preferred sitting chattering there all night. Laura, without\nany sign of noticing the rudeness of this address, rose, and said she\nwas quite ready to attend her Ladyship. In vain did the De Courcys\nentreat her to prolong her visit till the morning. To dare to be happy\nwithout her concurrence, was treason against Lady Pelham's dignity; and\nunfortunately she was not in a humour to concur in the joy of any living\nthing. De Courcy's reserve towards her new favourite she considered as a\ntacit reproof of her own cordiality; and she had just such a conviction\nthat the reproof was deserved, as to make her thoroughly out of humour\nwith the reprover, with herself, and consequently with everybody else.\nDetermined to interrupt pleasure which she would not share, the more her\nhosts pressed her stay, the more she hastened her departure; and she\nmingled her indifferent good nights to them with more energetic\nreprimands to the tardiness of her coachman.\n\n'Thank heaven,' said she, thrusting herself into the corner of her\ncarriage with that jerk in her motion which indicates a certain degree\nof irritation, 'to-morrow we shall probably see a civilized being.' A\nshort pause followed. Laura's plain integrity and prudence had gained\nsuch ascendancy over Lady Pelham, that her niece's opinion was to her\nLadyship a kind of second conscience, having, indeed, much the same\npowers as the first. Its sanction was necessary to her quiet, though it\nhad not force to controul her actions. On the present occasion she\nwished, above all things, to know Laura's sentiments; but she would not\ncondescend to ask them directly. 'Colonel Hargrave's manners are quite\nthose of a gentleman,' she resumed. The remark was entirely ineffectual;\nfor Laura coolly assented, without inquiring whether he were the\ncivilized being whom Lady Pelham expected to see. Another pause.\n'Colonel Hargrave will be at Walbourne to-morrow,' said Lady Pelham, the\ntone of her voice sharpening with impatience. 'Will he, Ma'am?' returned\nLaura, without moving a muscle. 'If Miss Montreville has no objections,'\nsaid Lady Pelham, converting by a toss of her head and a twist of her\nupper lip, the words of compliment into an insult. 'Probably,' said\nLaura, with a smile, 'my objections would make no great\ndifference.'--'Oh, to be sure!' returned Lady Pelham, 'it would be lost\nlabour to state them to such an obstinate, unreasonable person as I am!\nWell, I believe you are the first who ever accused me of obstinacy.' If\nLady Pelham expected a compliment to her pliability, she was\ndisappointed; for Laura only answered, 'I shall never presume to\ninterfere in the choice of your Ladyship's visitors.'\n\nThat she should be thus compelled to be explicit was more than Lady\nPelham's temper could endure. Her eyes flashing with rage, 'Superlative\nhumility indeed!' she exclaimed with a sneer; but, awed, in spite of\nherself, from the free expression of her fury, she muttered it within\nher shut teeth in a sentence of which the words 'close' and 'jesuitical'\nalone reached Laura's ear. A long and surly silence followed; Lady\nPelham's pride and anger struggling with her desire to learn the\nfoundation and extent of the disapprobation which she suspected that her\nconduct excited. The latter, at last, partly prevailed; though Lady\nPelham still disclaimed condescending to direct consultation.\n\n'Pray, Miss Montreville,' said she, 'if Colonel Hargrave's visits were\nto _you_, what mighty objections might your sanctity find to\nthem?'--Laura had long ago observed that a slight exertion of her spirit\nwas the best _quietus_ to her aunt's ill humour; and, therefore,\naddressing her with calm austerity, she said, 'Any young woman, Madam,\nwho values her reputation, might object to Colonel Hargrave's visits,\nmerely on the score of prudence. But even my \"superlative humility\" does\nnot reconcile me to company which I despise; and my \"sanctity,\" as your\nLadyship is pleased to call it, rather shrinks from the violator of laws\ndivine and human.'\n\nLady Pelham withdrew her eyes to escape a glance which they never could\nstand; but, bridling, she said, 'Well, Miss Montreville, I am neither\nyoung nor sanctimonious, therefore your objections cannot apply to\nColonel Hargrave's visits to me; and I am determined,' continued she,\nspeaking as if strength of voice denoted strength of resolution, 'I am\ndetermined, that I will not throw away the society of an agreeable man,\nto gratify the whims of a parcel of narrow-minded bigots.'\n\nTo this attack Laura answered only with a smile. She smiled to see\nherself classed with the De Courcys; for she had no doubt that they were\nthe 'bigots' to whom Lady Pelham referred. She smiled, too, to observe\nthat the boasted freedom of meaner minds is but a poor attempt to hide\nfrom themselves the restraint imposed by the opinions of the wise and\ngood.\n\nThe carriage stopped, and Laura took sanctuary in her own apartment; but\nat supper she met her aunt with smiles of unaffected complacency, and,\naccording to the plan which she invariably pursued, appeared to have\nforgotten Lady Pelham's fit of spleen; by that means enabling her aunt\nto recover from it with as little expence to her pride as possible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nLady Pelham was not disappointed in her expectation of seeing Colonel\nHargrave on the following day. He called at Walbourne while her Ladyship\nwas still at her toilette; and was shown into the drawing-room, where\nLaura had already taken her station. She rose to receive him, with an\nair which shewed that his visit gave her neither surprise nor pleasure;\nand, motioning him to a distant seat, quietly resumed her occupation.\nHargrave was a little disconcerted. He expected that Laura would shun\nhim, with marks of strong resentment, or perhaps with the agitation of\noffended love; and he was prepared for nothing but to entreat the\naudience which she now seemed inclined to offer him.\n\nLovers are so accustomed to accuse ladies of cruelty, and to find ladies\ntake pleasure in being so accused, that unlooked-for kindness\ndiscomposes them; and a favour unhoped is generally a favour undesired.\nThe consciousness of ill desert, the frozen serenity of Laura's manner,\ndeprived Hargrave of courage to use the opportunity which she seemed\nvoluntarily to throw in his way. He hesitated, he faltered; while, all\nunlike her former self, Laura appeared determined that he should make\nlove, for she would not aid his dilemma even by a comment on the\nweather. All the timidity which formerly marked her demeanour, was now\ntransferred to his; and, arranging her work with stoical composure, she\nraised her head to listen, as Hargrave approaching her stammered out an\nincoherent sentence expressive of his unalterable love, and his fears\nthat he had offended almost beyond forgiveness.\n\nLaura suffered him to conclude without interruption; then answered, in a\nvoice mild but determined, 'I had some hopes, Sir, from your knowledge\nof my character and sentiments, that, after what has passed, you could\nhave entertained no doubts on this subject.--Yet, lest even a shadow of\nsuspense should rest on your mind, I have remained here this morning on\npurpose to end it. I sincerely grieve to hear that you still retain the\npartiality you have been pleased to express, since it is now beyond my\npower to make even the least return.'\n\nThe utmost bitterness of reproach would not have struck so chilly on the\nheart of Hargrave as these words, and the manner in which they were\nuttered. From the principles of Laura he had indeed dreaded much; but he\nhad feared nothing from her indifference. He had feared that duty might\nobtain a partial victory; but he had never doubted that inclination\nwould survive the struggle. With a mixture of doubt, surprise, and\nanguish, he continued to gaze upon her after she was silent; then\nstarting, he exclaimed--'I will not believe it; it is impossible. Oh,\nLaura, choose some other way to stab, for I cannot bear this!'--'It\npains me,' said Laura, in a voice of undissembled concern, 'to add\ndisappointment to the pangs which you cannot but feel; yet it were most\nblameable now to cherish in you the faintest expectation.'--'Stop,'\ncried Hargrave, vehemently, 'if you would not have me utterly undone. I\nhave never known peace or innocence but in the hope of your love; leave\nme a dawning of that hope, however distant. Nay, do not look as if it\nwere impossible. When you thought me a libertine, a seducer--all that\nyou can now think me, you suffered me to hope. Let me but begin my trial\nnow, and all woman-kind shall not lure me from you.'\n\n'Ah,' said Laura, 'when I dreamt of the success of that trial, a strange\ninfatuation hung over me. Now it has passed away for ever. Sincerely do\nI wish and pray for your repentance, but I can no longer offer to reward\nit. My desire for your reformation will henceforth be as disinterested\nas sincere.'\n\nHalf distracted with the cutting calmness of her manner, so changed\nsince the time when every feature spoke the struggles of the heart, when\nthe mind's whole strength seemed collected to resist its tenderness,\nHargrave again vehemently refused to believe in her indifference. ''Tis\nbut a few short months,' he cried, grasping her hand with a violence\nthat made her turn pale; ''tis but a few short months since you loved me\nwith your whole soul, since you said that your peace depended upon my\nreturn to virtue. And dare you answer it to yourself to cast away the\ninfluence, the only influence that can secure me?'\n\n'If I have any influence with you,' returned Laura, with a look and an\nattitude of earnest entreaty, 'let it but this once prevail, and then be\nlaid aside for ever. Let me persuade you to the review of your conduct;\nto the consideration of your prospects as an accountable being, of the\nvengeance that awaits the impenitent, of the escape offered in the\ngospel. As you value your happiness, let me thus far prevail. Or if it\nwill move you more,' continued she, the tears gushing from her eyes, 'I\nwill beseech you to grant this, my only request; in memory of a love\nthat mourned your unworthiness almost unto death.'\n\nThe sight of her emotions revived Hargrave's hopes; and, casting himself\nat her feet, he passionately declared, while she shuddered at the\nimpious sentiment, that he asked no heaven but her love, and cared not\nwhat were his fate if she were lost. 'Ah, Sir,' said she, with pious\nsolemnity, 'believe me, the time is not distant when the disappointment\nof this passion will seem to you a sorrow light as the baffled sports of\nchildhood. Believe the testimony of one who but lately drew near to the\ngates of the grave. On a death-bed, guilt appears the only real misery;\nand lesser evils are lost amidst its horror like shadows in a\nmidnight-gloom.'\n\nThe ideas which Laura was labouring to introduce into the mind of\nHargrave were such as he had of late too successfully endeavoured to\nexclude. They had intruded like importunate creditors; till, oft refused\nadmittance, they had ceased to return. The same arts which he had used\nto disguise from himself the extent of his criminality, he now naturally\nemployed to extenuate it in the sight of Laura. He assured her that he\nwas less guilty than she supposed; that she could form no idea of the\nforce of the temptation which had overcome him; that Lady Bellamer was\nless the victim of his passions than of her own; he vehemently protested\nthat he despised and abhorred the wanton who had undone him; and that,\neven in the midst of a folly for which he now execrated himself, his\naffections had never wandered from their first object. While he spoke,\nLaura in confusion cast down her eyes, and offended modesty suffused her\nface and neck with crimson. She could indeed form no idea of a heart\nwhich, attached to one woman, could find any temptation in the\nallurements of another. But when he ended, virtuous indignation flashing\nin her countenance, 'For shame, Sir!' said she. 'If any thing could\ndegrade you in my eyes it were this mean attempt to screen yourself\nbehind the partner of your wickedness. Does it lessen your guilt that it\nhad not even the poor excuse of passion; or think you that, even in the\nhours of a weakness for which you have given me such just reason to\ndespise myself, I could have prized the affections of a heart so\ndepraved? You say you detest your crime; I fear you only detest its\npunishment; for, were you really repentant, my opinion, the opinion of\nthe whole world, would seem to you a trifle unworthy of regard, and the\nutmost bitterness of censure be but an echo to your own\nself-upbraidings.'\n\nHargrave had no inclination to discuss the nature of repentance. His\nsole desire was to wrest from Laura some token, however slight, of\nreturning tenderness. For this purpose he employed all the eloquence\nwhich he had often found successful in similar attempts. But no two\nthings can be more different in their effects, than the language of\npassion poured into the sympathizing bosom of mutual love, or addressed\nto the dull ear of indifference. The expressions which Laura once\nthought capable of warming the coldest heart seemed now the mere ravings\nof insanity; the lamentations which she once thought might have softened\nrocks, now appeared the weak complainings of a child for his lost toy.\nWith a mixture of pity and disgust she listened and replied; till the\nentrance of Lady Pelham put a period to the dialogue, and Laura\nimmediately quitted the room.\n\nLady Pelham easily perceived that the conversation had been particular;\nand Hargrave did not long leave her in doubt as to the subject. He\nacquainted her with his pretensions to Laura, and begged her sanction to\nhis addresses; assuring her that his intercourse with Lady Bellamer was\nentirely broken off, and that his marriage would secure his permanent\nreformation. He complimented Lady Pelham upon her liberality of\nsentiment and knowledge of the world; from both of which he had hopes,\nhe said, that she would not consider one error as sufficient to blast\nhis character. Lady Pelham made a little decent hesitation on the score\nof Lady Bellamer's prior claims; but was assured that no engagement had\never subsisted there. 'She hoped Lord Lincourt would not be averse.' She\nwas told that Lord Lincourt anxiously desired to see his nephew settled.\n'She hoped Colonel Hargrave was resolved that his married life should be\nirreproachable. Laura had a great deal of sensibility, it would break\nher heart to be neglected; and Lady Pelham was sure, that in that case\nthe thought of having consented to the dear child's misery would be more\nthan she could support!' Her Ladyship was vanquished by an assurance,\nthat for Laura to be neglected by her happy husband was utterly\nimpossible.\n\n'Laura's inclinations then must be consulted; every thing depended upon\nher concurrence, for the sweet girl had really so wound herself round\nLady Pelham's heart, that positively her Ladyship could not bear to give\nher a moment's uneasiness, or to press her upon a subject to which she\nwas at all averse.' And, strange as it may seem, Lady Pelham at that\nmoment believed herself incapable of distressing the person whom, in\nfact, she tormented with ceaseless ingenuity! Hargrave answered by\nconfessing his fears that he was for the present less in favour than he\nhad once been; but he disclosed Laura's former confessions of\npartiality, and insinuated his conviction that it was smothered rather\nthan extinguished.\n\nLady Pelham could now account for Laura's long illness and low spirits;\nand she listened with eager curiosity to the solution of the enigma,\nwhich had so long perplexed her. She considered whether she should\nrelate to the lover the sorrows he had caused. She judged (for Lady\nPelham often _judged_ properly) that it would be indelicate thus to\nproclaim to him the extent of his power; but, with the usual\ninconsistency between her judgment and her practice, in half an hour she\nhad informed him of all that she had observed, and hinted all that she\nsuspected. Hargrave listened, was convinced, and avowed his conviction\nthat Lady Pelham's influence was alone necessary to secure his success.\nHer Ladyship said, 'that she should feel some delicacy in using any\nstrong influence with her niece, as the amiable orphan had no friend but\nherself, had owed somewhat to her kindness, and might be biassed by\ngratitude against her own inclination. The fortune which she meant to\nbequeath to Laura might by some be thought to confer a right to advise;\nbut, for her part, she thought her little all was no more than due to\nthe person whose tender assiduities filled the blank which had been left\nin her Ladyship's maternal heart by the ingratitude and disobedience of\nher child.' This sentiment was pronounced in a tone so pathetic, and in\nlanguage so harmonious, that, though it did not for a moment impose upon\nher hearer, it deceived Lady Pelham herself; and she shed tears, which\nshe actually imagined to be forced from her by the mingled emotions of\ngratitude and of disappointed tenderness.\n\nLady Pelham had now entered on a subject inexhaustible; her own\nfeelings, her own misfortunes, her own dear self. Hargrave, who in his\nhours of tolerable composure was the most polite of men, listened, or\nappeared to listen, with unconquerable patience, till he fortunately\nrecollected an appointment which his interest in her Ladyship's\nconversation had before banished from his mind; when he took his leave,\nbearing with him a very gracious invitation to repeat his visit.\n\nWith him departed Lady Pelham's fit of sentimentality; and, in five\nminutes, she had dried her eyes, composed the paragraph which was to\nannounce the marriage of Lord Lincourt (for she killed off the old peer\nwithout ceremony) to the lovely heiress of the amiable Lady Pelham;\ntaken possession of her niece's barouche and four, and heard herself\nannounced as the benefactress of this new wonder of the world of\nfashion. She would cut off her rebellious daughter with a shilling; give\nher up to the beggary and obscurity which she had chosen, and leave her\nwhole fortune to Lady Lincourt; for so, in the fulness of her content,\nshe called Laura. After some time enjoying her niece's prospects, or to\nspeak more justly her own, she began to think of discovering how near\nthey might be to their accomplishment; and, for this purpose, she\nsummoned Laura to a conference.\n\nLady Pelham loved nothing on earth but herself; yet vanity, gratified\ncuriosity, and, above all, the detection of a mere human weakness\nreducing Laura somewhat more to her own level awakened in her breast an\nemotion resembling affection; as, throwing her arms round her niece,\nshe, in language half sportive, half tender, declared her knowledge of\nLaura's secret, and reproached her with having concealed it so well.\nInsulted, wronged, and forsaken by Hargrave, Laura had kept his secret\ninviolable, for she had no right to disclose it; but she scorned, by any\nevasion, to preserve her own. Glowing with shame and mortification, she\nstood silently shrinking from Lady Pelham's looks; till, a little\nrecovering herself, she said, 'I deserve to be thus humbled for my folly\nin founding my regards, not on the worth of their object, but on my own\nimagination; and more, if it be possible, do I deserve, for exposing my\nweakness to one who has been so ungenerous as to boast of it. But it is\nsome compensation to my pride,' continued she, raising her eyes, 'that\nmy disorder is cured beyond the possibility of relapse.' Lady Pelham\nsmiled at Laura's security, which she did not consider as an infallible\nsign of safety. It was in vain that Laura proceeded solemnly to protest\nher indifference. Lady Pelham could allow for self-deceit in another's\ncase, though she never suspected it in her own. Vain were Laura's\ncomments upon Hargrave's character; they were but the fond revilings of\noffended love. Laura did not deny her former preference; she even owed\nthat it was the sudden intelligence of Hargrave's crimes which had\nreduced her to the brink of the grave; therefore Lady Pelham was\nconvinced that a little perseverance would fan the smothered flame; and\nperseverance, she hoped, would not be wanting. Nevertheless, as her\nLadyship balanced her fondness for contradicting by her aversion to\nbeing contradicted, and as Laura was too much in earnest to study the\nqualifying tone, the conference concluded rather less amicably than it\nbegan; though it ended by Lady Pelham's saying, not very consistently\nwith her sentiments an hour before, that she would never cease to urge\nso advantageous a match, conceiving that she had a right to influence\nthe choice of one whom she would make the heiress of forty thousand\npounds. Laura was going to insist that all influence would be\nineffectual, but her aunt quitted her without suffering her to reply.\nShe would have followed to represent the injustice of depriving Mrs\nHerbert of her natural rights; but she desisted on recollecting that\nLady Pelham's purposes were like wedges, never fixed but by resistance.\n\nThe time had been when Lady Pelham's fortune would have seemed to\nHargrave as dust in the balance, joined with the possession of Laura. He\nhad gamed, had felt the want of money; and money was no longer\nindifferent to him. But Laura's dower was still light in his estimation,\ncompared with its weight in that of Lambert, to whom he accidentally\nmentioned Lady Pelham's intention. That prudent person calculated that\n\u00c2\u00a340,000 would form a very handsome addition to a fund upon which he\nintended to draw pretty freely. He had little doubt of Hargrave's\nsuccess; he had never known any woman with whom such a lover could fail.\nHe thought he could lead his friend to bargain for immediate possession\nof part of his bride's portion, and, for certainty of the rest in\nreversion, before parting with his liberty. He allowed two, or perhaps\neven three months for the duration of Laura's influence; during which\ntime he feared he should have little of her husband's company at the\ngaming-table; but from thenceforth, he judged that the day would be his\nown, and that he should soon possess himself of Hargrave's property, so\nfar as it was alienable. He considered that, in the meantime, Laura\nwould furnish attraction sufficient to secure Hargrave's stay at --, and\nhe trusted to his own dexterity for improving that circumstance to the\nbest advantage. He failed not, therefore, to encourage the lover's\nhopes, and bestowed no small ridicule on the idea that a girl of\nnineteen should desert a favourite on account of his gallantry.\n\nCool cunning would engage with fearful odds against imprudence, if it\ncould set bounds to the passions, as well as direct their course. But it\nis often deceived in estimating the force of feelings which it knows\nonly by their effects. Lambert soon found that he had opened the passage\nto a torrent which bore all before it. The favourite stimulus found, its\ntemporary substitute was almost disregarded; and Hargrave, intoxicated\nwith his passion, tasted sparingly of the poisoned cup which his friend\ndesigned for him. His time and thoughts were again devoted to Laura, and\ngaming was only sought as a relief from the disappointment and vexation\nwhich generally attended his pursuit. The irritation of his mind,\nhowever, made amends for the lessened number of opportunities for\nplundering him, by rendering it easier to take advantage of those which\nremained.\n\nThe insinuating manners and elegant person of Hargrave gained daily on\nthe favour of Lady Pelham; for the great as well as the little vulgar\nare the slaves of mere externals. She permitted his visits at home and\nhis attendance abroad, expatiating frequently on the liberality of\nsentiment which she thus displayed. At first these encomiums on her own\nconduct were used only to disguise from herself and others her\nconsciousness of its impropriety; but she repeated them till she\nactually believed them just, and considered herself as extending a\ncharitable hand to rescue an erring brother from the implacable\nmalignity of the world.\n\nShe was indefatigable in her attempts to promote his success with Laura.\nShe lost no opportunity of pressing the subject. She obstinately refused\nto be convinced of the possibility of overcoming a strong prepossession.\nLaura, in an evil hour for herself, thoughtlessly replied, that\naffection was founded on the belief of excellence, and must of course\ngive way when the foundation was removed. This observation had just\nfallacy sufficient for Lady Pelham's purpose. She took it for her text,\nand harangued upon it with all the zeal and perseverance of disputation.\nShe called it Laura's theory; and insisted that, like other theorists,\nshe would shut her eyes against the plainest facts, nay, stifle the\nfeelings of her own mind, rather than admit what might controvert her\nopinion. She cited all the instances which her memory could furnish of\nagricultural, and chemical, and metaphysical theorism; and, with\nastonishing ingenuity, contrived to draw a parallel between each of them\nand Laura's case. It was in vain that Laura qualified, almost retracted\nher unlucky observation. Her adversary would not suffer her to desert\nthe untenable ground. Delighted with her victory, she returned again\nand again to the attack, after the vanquished had appealed to her mercy;\nand much more than 'thrice she slew the slain.'\n\nSick of arguing about the possibility of her indifference, Laura at\nlength confined herself to simple assertions of the fact. Lady Pelham at\nfirst merely refused her belief; and, with provoking pity, rallied her\nniece upon her self-deceit; but, finding that she corroborated her words\nby a corresponding behaviour to Hargrave, her Ladyship's temper betrayed\nits accustomed infirmity. She peevishly reproached Laura with taking a\ncoquettish delight in giving pain; insisted that her conduct was a\ntissue of cruelty and affectation; and upbraided her with\ndisingenuousness in pretending an indifference which she could not feel.\n'And does your Ladyship communicate this opinion to Colonel Hargrave?'\nsaid Laura, one day, fretted almost beyond her patience by a\nremonstrance of two hours continuance. 'To be sure I do,' returned Lady\nPelham. 'In common humanity I will not allow him to suffer more from\nyour perverseness than I can avoid.' 'Well, Madam,' said Laura, with a\nsigh and a shrug of impatient resignation, 'nothing remains but that I\nshew a consistency, which, at least is not common to affectation.'\n\nLady Pelham's representations had their effect upon Hargrave. They\nbrought balm to his wounded pride, and he easily suffered them to\ncounteract the effect of Laura's calm and uniform assurances of her\nindifference. While he listened to these, her apparent candour and\nsimplicity, the regret she expressed at the necessity of giving pain,\nbrought temporary conviction to his mind; and, with transports of\nalternate rage and grief, he now execrated her inconstancy, then his own\nunworthiness; now abjured her, then the vices which had deprived him of\nher affection. But the joint efforts of Lady Pelham and Lambert always\nrevived hopes sufficient to make him continue a pursuit which he had not\nindeed the fortitude to relinquish.\n\nHis love (if we must give that name to a selfish desire, mingled at\ntimes with every ungentle feeling), had never been so ardent. The\nwell-known principle of our nature which adds charms to what is\nunattainable, lent new attractions to Laura's really improved\nloveliness. The smile which was reserved for others seemed but the more\nenchanting; the hand which he was forbidden to touch seemed but the more\nsoft and snowy; the form which was kept sacred from his approach,\nbewitched him with more resistless graces. Hargrave had been little\naccustomed to suppress any of his feelings, and he gave vent to this\nwith an entire neglect of the visible uneasiness which it occasioned to\nits subject. He employed the private interviews, which Lady Pelham\ncontrived to extort for him, in the utmost vehemence of complaint,\nprotestation, and entreaty. He laboured to awaken the pity of Laura; he\neven condescended to appeal to her ambition; and persevered, in spite of\nunequivocal denials, till Laura, disgusted, positively refused ever\nagain to admit him without witnesses.\n\nHis public attentions were, if possible, still more distressing to her.\nEncouraged by Lady Pelham, he, notwithstanding the almost repulsive\ncoldness of Laura's manner, became her constant attendant. He pursued\nher wherever she went; placed himself, in defiance of propriety, so as\nto monopolize her conversation; and seemed to have laid aside all his\ndistinguishing politeness, while he neglected every other woman to\ndevote his assiduities to her alone. He claimed the station by her side\ntill Laura had the mortification to observe that others resigned it at\nhis approach; he snatched every opportunity of whispering his adulations\nin her ear; and, far from affecting any concealment in his preference,\nseemed to claim the character of her acknowledged adorer. It is\nimpossible to express the vexation with which Laura endured this\nindelicate pre-eminence. Had Hargrave been the most irreproachable of\nmankind, she would have shrunk from such obtrusive marks of his\npartiality; but her sense of propriety was no less wounded by the\nattendance of such a companion, than her modesty was shocked by her\nbeing thus dragged into the notice, and committed to the mercy of the\npublic. The exclusive attentions of the handsome Colonel Hargrave, the\nmirror of gallantry, the future Lord Lincourt, were not, however\nundesired, to be possessed unenvied. Those who unsuccessfully angled for\nhis notice, avenged themselves on her to whom they imputed their\nfailure, by looks of scorn, and by sarcastic remarks, which they\nsometimes contrived should reach the ear of the innocent object of their\nmalice. Laura, unspeakably averse to being the subject of even laudatory\nobservation, could sometimes scarcely restrain the tears of shame and\nmortification that were wrung from her by attacks which she could\nneither resent nor escape. In spite of the natural sweetness of her\ntemper, she was sometimes tempted to retort upon Colonel Hargrave the\nvexation which he caused to her: and his officiousness almost compelled\nher to forsake the civility within the bounds of which she had\ndetermined to confine her coldness.\n\nHe complained bitterly of this treatment, and reproached her with taking\nungenerous advantage of his passion. 'Why then,' said she, 'will you\nforce me into the insolence of power. If you will suffer me to consider\nyou as a common acquaintance, I shall never claim a right to avenge on\nyou the wrongs of society; but approach no nearer.--I am unwilling to\nexpress a sentiment less respectful than dislike.' The proud spirit of\nHargrave, however, could ill brook the repulses which he constantly\nprovoked; and often in transports of rage he would break from Laura,\nswearing that he would no more submit to be thus made the sport of an\ninsensible tyrannical woman.\n\nAt first she submitted with patience to his injurious language, in the\nhope that he would keep his oaths; but she soon found that he only\nrepaid her endurance of his anger by making her submit to what was yet\nmore painful, a renewal of his abject supplications. All her caution\ncould not prevent the private interviews which she granted so\nunwillingly. He haunted her walks, stole upon her unannounced, detained\nher almost by force at these accidental meetings, or at those which he\nobtained by the favour of Lady Pelham. His whole conduct conspired to\nmake him an object of real dread to Laura, though her watchful\nself-command and habitual benevolence preserved him from her aversion.\n\nSometimes she could not help wondering at the obstinacy of her\npersecutor. 'Surely,' said she to him, 'after all I have said, after the\nmanner in which I have said it, you cannot expect any fruit from all\nthese rhapsodies; you must surely think your honour bound to keep them\nup, at whatever hazard to the credit of your understanding.' Laura had\nnever herself submitted to be driven into a course of actions contrary\nto reason, and it never occurred to her that her lover had no reason for\nhis conduct, except that he was not sufficiently master of himself to\ndesist from his pursuit.\n\nFrom the importunities of Hargrave, however, Laura could sometimes\nescape. Though they were frequent, they were of necessity intermitting.\nHe could not always be at Walbourne; he could not intrude into her\napartment. She visited sometimes where he was not admitted, or she could\ndecline the invitation which she knew extended to him. But her\npersecutions by Lady Pelham had no intermission; from them she had no\nretreat. Her chamber was no sanctuary from so familiar a friend; and the\npresence of strangers only served to exercise her Ladyship in that\ningenious species of conversation which addresses to the _sense_ of one\nof the company what it conveys to the _ear_ of the rest.\n\nFor some time she employed all her forces in combating Laura's supposed\naffectation; and when, not without extreme difficulty, she was convinced\nthat she strove against a phantom of her own creation, she next employed\nher efforts to alter her niece's determination. She tried to rouse her\nambition; and again and again expatiated on all the real and on all the\nimaginary advantages of wealth and title. The theme in her Ladyship's\nhands seemed inexhaustible, though Laura repeatedly declared that no\nearthly thing could be less in her esteem than distinctions which she\nmust share with such a person as Hargrave. Every day and all day, the\nsubject was canvassed, and the oft-confuted argument vamped up anew,\ntill Laura was thoroughly weary of the very names of rank, and\ninfluence, and coronets, and coaches.\n\nNext, her Ladyship was eloquent upon Laura's implacability. 'Those who\nwere so very unforgiving,' she supposed, 'were conscious that they had\nno need to be forgiven. Such people might pretend to be Christians, but\nin her opinion such pretensions were mere hypocrisy.' Laura stood amazed\nat the strength of self-deception which could produce this sentiment\nfrom lips which had pronounced inextinguishable resentment against an\nonly child. Recovering herself, she calmly made the obvious reply, 'that\nshe entertained no enmity against Hargrave; that on the contrary she\nsincerely wished him every blessing, and the best of all blessings, a\nrenewed mind; but that the Christian precept was never meant to make the\nvicious and the impure the denizens of our bosoms.' It might be thought\nthat such a reply was quite sufficient, but Lady Pelham possessed one\ngrand qualification for a disputant; she defied conviction. She could\nshift, and turn, and bewilder, till she found herself precisely at the\npoint from whence she set out.\n\nShe had a practice, too, of all others the most galling to an ingenuous\nand independent spirit--she would invent a set of opinions and\nsentiments, and then argue upon them as if they were real. It was in\nvain for Laura to disclaim them. Lady Pelham could prove\nincontrovertibly that they were Laura's sentiments; or, which was the\nsame thing, proceeded as if she had proved it. She insisted that Laura\nacted on a principle of revenge against Hargrave, for the slight his\ninconstancy had put upon her; and argued most convincingly on the folly\nand wickedness of a revengeful spirit. Laura in vain protested her\ninnocence. Lady Pelham was certain of the fact; and she dilated on the\nguilt of such a sentiment, and extenuated the temporary recession of\nHargrave, till a bystander must have concluded that Laura was the\ndelinquent, and he her harmless victim. Her Ladyship declared, that,\n'she did not wonder at her niece's obduracy. She had never, in her life,\nknown a person of cool temper who was capable of forgiving. She had\nreason, for her own part, to be thankful that, if she had the failings\nof a warm temper, she had its advantages too. She had never, except in\none instance, known what it was to feel permanent displeasure.'\n\nOn this topic Lady Pelham had the more room for her eloquence, because\nit admitted of no reply; and, perhaps, for this reason it was the sooner\nexhausted; for it had not been discussed above half a dozen times,\nbefore she forsook it in order to assert her claims to influence her\nniece's decision. And here her Ladyship was suddenly convinced of the\nindefensible rights of relationship. 'She stood in the place of Laura's\nparents, and in their title might claim authority.' But finding Laura\nfirmly of opinion that parental authority extended no further than a\nnegative voice, Lady Pelham laid aside the imperative tone to take up\nthat of entreaty. 'She would not advance the claim which her tried\nfriendship might give her to advise; she would only beseech, conjure.\nShe hoped her importunities would be forgiven, as they could proceed\nonly from the tenderest regard to her dear girl's wishes. Laura was her\nonly hope; the sole being on earth to whom her widowed heart clung with\npartial affection--and to see her thus throw away her happiness was more\nthan her Ladyship could bear.' Closely as Laura had studied her aunt's\ncharacter, and well as it was now known to her, she was sometimes\noverpowered by these expressions of love and sorrow; and wept as she was\ncompelled to repeat that her happiness and her duty must alike be\nsacrificed ere she could yield to the wishes of her friend. But as she\nnever, even in these moments of softness, betrayed the smallest symptom\nof compliance, Lady Pelham had not patience to adhere to the only method\nof attack that possessed a chance of success.\n\nOf all her arts of teazing, this was indeed the most distressing to a\nperson of Laura's sensibility, and she felt not a little relieved when,\nexasperated by the failure of all her efforts, Lady Pelham burst into\nvehement upbraidings of her niece's hardness of heart. 'She could not\nhave conceived,' she said, 'such obduracy in one so young; in woman too;\na creature who should be all made up of softness. Laura might pique\nherself upon her stoicism, but a Zeno in petticoats was, in her\nopinion, a monster. For her part she could never resist entreaty in her\nlife.'\n\n'Then I beseech you Madam,' said Laura, after having patiently submitted\nto be baited thus for three full hours, 'do not make mine an exception;\nbut for pity's sake be prevailed upon to drop this subject. I assure you\nit can have no effect but to distress me.'\n\n'You may be determined, Miss Montreville, that all my endeavours shall\nbe in vain, but I shall certainly never be so far wanting to my duty as\nto neglect pressing upon you a match so much for your honour and\nadvantage.'\n\n'Is it possible,' cried Laura, losing patience at this prospect of the\ncontinuation of her persecutions, 'that your Ladyship can think it for\nmy \"advantage\" to marry a man I despise; for my \"honour\" to share the\ninfamy of an adulterer!'\n\n'Upon my word, Miss Montreville,' returned Lady Pelham, reddening with\nanger, 'I am constrained to admire the delicacy of your language; so\nvery suitable to the lips of so very delicate a lady.'\n\nA smile, not wholly free from sarcasm, played on Laura's lips. 'If\ndelicacy,' said she, 'be henceforth to find so strenuous a supporter in\nyour Ladyship, I shall hope to be exempted in future from all\nremonstrance on the subject of this evening's altercation.'\n\nIf Laura really entertained the hope she mentioned, she was miserably\ndisappointed; for Lady Pelham remitted not a jot of her tormentings. Her\nremonstrances were administered in every possible form, upon every\npossible occasion. They seasoned every t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate, were insinuated into\nevery conversation. Laura's attempts to avoid the subject were\naltogether vain. The discourse might begin with the conquests of Gengis\nKhan, but it always ended with the advantages of marrying Colonel\nHargrave.\n\nTeazed and persecuted, disturbed in every useful occupation and every\ndomestic enjoyment, Laura often considered of the possibility of\ndelivering herself from her indefatigable tormentors, by quitting the\nprotection of her aunt and taking refuge with Mrs Douglas. But this plan\nshe had unfortunately deprived herself of the means of executing.\n\nLaura knew that her cousins, the Herberts, were poor. She knew that Mrs\nHerbert was in a situation which needs comforts that poverty cannot\ncommand, and it was vain to expect these comforts from the maternal\ncompassion of Lady Pelham. She therefore determined to supply them, as\nfar as possible, from her own little fund; and fearing that a gift from\nher might revolt the high spirit of Herbert, she inclosed almost all her\nhalf-year's annuity in a blank cover, and conveyed it to her cousin. All\nthat she retained was a sum far too small to defray the expence of a\njourney to Scotland; and several months were to elapse before she could\nrecruit her fund. Till then, she had no resource but patience; and she\nendeavoured to console herself with a hope that in time the perseverance\nof her adversaries would fail.\n\nOften did she with a sigh turn her eyes towards Norwood--Norwood, the\nseat of all the peaceful domestic virtues; where the voice of contention\nwas unheard, where courtly politeness, though duly honoured, held the\nsecond place to the courtesy of the heart. But Mrs De Courcy had never\nhinted a wish that Laura should be a permanent inmate of her family,\nand, even if she had, there would have been a glaring impropriety in\nforsaking Lady Pelham's house for one in its immediate neighbourhood. De\nCourcy, too, she thought, was not the kind friend he was wont to be. She\nhad of late seen him seldom, which was probably caused by the marked\ncoolness of Lady Pelham's reception; but it had happened unfortunately\nthat he had twice surprised her in the midst of Hargrave's\nextravagancies, when she almost feared to speak to him, lest she should\nawaken the furious jealousy to which her tormentor was subject, and she\ndreaded that her father's friend (for so she loved to call him)\nsuspected her of encouraging the addresses of such a lover. During these\nvisits he had looked, she thought, displeased, and had early taken\nleave. Was it kind to judge her unheard? Perhaps, if an opportunity had\nbeen given her, she might have assumed courage to exculpate herself;\nbut, without even calling to ask her commands, De Courcy was gone with\nMr Bolingbroke to London, to make arrangements for Harriet's marriage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nThough Laura could not escape the attacks of Lady Pelham, she sometimes\nfound means to elude those of Hargrave. She watched his approach; and\nwhenever he appeared, intrenched herself in her own apartment. She\nconfined herself almost entirely to the house, and excused herself from\nevery visit where she thought he might be of the party. He besieged her\nwith letters; she sent them back unopened. Lady Pelham commanded her to\nbe present during his visits; she respectfully, but peremptorily,\nrefused to comply.\n\nShe had thus remained a sort of prisoner for some weeks, when her aunt\none morning entered her room with an aspect which Laura could not well\ndecipher. 'Well, Miss Montreville,' said she, 'you have at last\naccomplished your purpose; your capricious tyranny has prevailed at\nlast; Colonel Hargrave leaves--this morning.' 'Dear Madam,' cried Laura,\nstarting up overjoyed, 'what a deliverance!' 'Oh to be sure, mighty\ncause you have to congratulate yourself upon a deliverance from a man\nwho might aspire to the first woman in England! But you will never have\nit in your power to throw away such another offer. You need hardly\nexpect to awaken such another passion.'\n\n'I hope, with all my heart, I shall not; but are you certain he will\ngo?' 'Oh, very certain. He has written to tell me so!' 'I trust he will\nkeep his word,' said Laura; 'and when I am sure he is gone, I will beg\nof your Ladyship to excuse me for a few hours, while I walk to Norwood.\nI have been so shackled of late! but the first use I make of my liberty\nshall be to visit my friends.' 'I am afraid, my dear,' returned Lady\nPelham, with more gentleness than she was accustomed to use in\ncontradiction, 'you will scarcely find time to visit Mrs De Courcy. I\nhave long promised to pass some time with my friend Mrs Bathurst; and I\npropose setting off to-morrow. I should die of _ennui_ here, now I have\nlost the society that has of late given me so much pleasure.'--'Mrs\nBathurst, Madam? she who was formerly'--'Poh, poh, child,' interrupted\nLady Pelham, 'don't stir up the embers of decayed slander--Will you\nnever learn to forget the little mistakes of your fellow-creatures? Mrs\nBathurst makes one of the best wives in the world; and to a man with\nwhom everybody would not live so well.'\n\nPractice had made Laura pretty expert in interpreting her aunt's\nlanguage, and she understood more in the present instance than it was\nmeant she should comprehend. She had heard of Mrs Bathurst's fame, and,\nknowing that it was not quite spotless, was rather averse to being the\ncompanion of Lady Pelham's visit; but she never, without mature\ndeliberation, refused compliance with her aunt's wishes; and she\nresolved to consider the matter before announcing opposition. Besides\nshe was determined to carry her point of seeing Mrs De Courcy, and\ntherefore did not wish to introduce any other subject of altercation.\n'Though I should accompany you to-morrow, Madam,' said she, 'I shall\nhave time sufficient for my walk to Norwood. The preparations for my\njourney cannot occupy an hour; and, if I go to Norwood now,' added she,\ntying on her bonnet, 'I can return early. Good morning, Madam; to-day I\nmay walk in peace.'\n\nLaura felt as if a mountain had been lifted from her breast as she\nbounded across the lawn, and thought that Colonel Hargrave was, by this\ntime, miles distant from Walbourne; but as she pursued her way, she\nbegan to wonder that Lady Pelham seemed so little moved by his\ndeparture. It was strange that she, who had remonstrated so warmly, so\nunceasingly, against Laura's behaviour to him, did not more vehemently\nupbraid her with its consequences. Lady Pelham's forbearance was not in\ncharacter--Laura did not know how to explain it. 'I have taken her by\nsurprise,' thought she, 'with my excursion to Norwood, but she will\ndiscuss it at large in the evening; and probably in many an evening--I\nshall never hear the last of it.'\n\nIt was needless, however, to anticipate evil, and Laura turned her\nthoughts to the explanation which she was bent on making to her friends.\nThe more she reflected, the more she was persuaded that De Courcy\nsuspected her of encouraging the addresses of Hargrave; addresses now\nprovokingly notorious to all the neighbourhood. He had most probably\ncommunicated the same opinion to his mother; and Laura wished much to\nexculpate herself, if she could do so without appearing officiously\ncommunicative. If she could meet Mr De Courcy alone, if he should lead\nto the subject, or if it should accidentally occur, she thought she\nmight be able to speak freely to him; more freely than even to Mrs De\nCourcy. 'It is strange, too,' thought she, 'that I should feel so little\nrestraint with a person of the other sex; less than ever I did with one\nof my own.--But my father's friend ought not to be classed with other\nmen.'\n\nHer eyes yet swam in tears of grateful recollection, when she raised\nthem to a horseman who was meeting her. It was Montague De Courcy; and,\nas he leisurely advanced, Laura's heart beat with a hope that he would,\nas he had often done before, dismount to accompany her walk. But\nMontague, though evidently in no haste to reach the place of his\ndestination, stopped only to make a slight inquiry after her health, and\nthen passed on. Laura's bosom swelled with grief, unmixed with\nresentment. 'He thinks,' said she, 'that I invite the attentions of a\nlibertine; and is it surprising that he should withdraw his friendship\nfrom me! But he will soon know his error.' And again she more cheerfully\npursued her way.\n\nHer courage failed her a little as she entered Norwood. 'What if Mrs De\nCourcy too should receive me coldly,' thought she; 'Can I notice it to\nher? Can I beg of her to listen to my justification?' These thoughts\ngave Laura an air of timidity and embarrassment as she entered the room\nwhere Mrs De Courcy was sitting alone. Her fears were groundless. Mrs De\nCourcy received her with kindness, gently reproaching her for her long\nabsence. Laura assured her that it was wholly involuntary, but 'of\nlate,' said she, hesitating, 'I have been very little from home.' Mrs De\nCourcy gave a faint melancholy smile; but did not inquire what had\nconfined her young friend. 'Harriet has just left me,' said she, 'to pay\nsome visits, and to secure the presence of a companion for a very\nimportant occasion. She meant also to solicit yours, if three weeks\nhence you are still to be capable of acting as a bridemaid.' Laura\nsmiling was about to reply, that being in no danger of forfeiting that\nprivilege, she would most joyfully attend Miss De Courcy; but she met a\nglance of such marked, such mournful scrutiny, that she stopped; and the\nnext moment was covered with blushes. 'Ah!' thought she, 'Mrs De Courcy\nindeed believes all that I feared, and more than I feared--What can I\nsay to her?'\n\nHer embarrassment confirmed Mrs De Courcy's belief; but, unwilling\nfurther to distress Laura, she said, 'Harriet herself will talk over all\nthese matters with you, and then your own peculiar manner will soften\nthe refusal into somewhat almost as pleasing as consent; if indeed you\nare obliged to refuse.' 'Indeed, Madam,' said Laura, 'nothing can be\nfurther from my thoughts than refusal; I shall most willingly, most\ngladly, attend Miss De Courcy; but may I--will you allow me to--to ask\nyou why you should expect me to refuse?' 'And if I answer you,' returned\nMrs De Courcy, 'will you promise to be candid with me on a subject where\nladies think that candour may be dispensed with?' 'I will promise to be\ncandid with you on every subject,' said Laura, rejoiced at this\nopportunity of entering on her justification. 'Then I will own to you,'\nsaid Mrs De Courcy, 'that circumstances have conspired with public\nreport to convince me that you are yourself about to need the good\noffice which Harriet solicits from you. Colonel Hargrave and you share\nbetween you the envy of our little world of fashion.' 'And have you,\nMadam--has Harriet--has Mr De Courcy given credit to this vexatious\nreport!' cried Laura, the tears of mortification filling her eyes. 'Ah\nhow differently should I have judged of you!'--'My dearest girl,' said\nMrs De Courcy, surprised but delighted, 'I assure you that none of us\nwould, upon slight grounds, believe any thing concerning you, that you\nwould not wish us to credit. But, in this instance, I thought my\nauthority indisputable; Lady Pelham'--'Is it possible,' cried Laura,\n'that my aunt could propagate such a report, when she knew the teasing,\nthe persecution that I have endured.' 'Lady Pelham did not directly\nassure me of its truth;' answered Mrs De Courcy; 'but when I made\ninquiries, somewhat, I own, in the hope of being empowered to contradict\nthe rumour, her answer was certainly calculated to make me believe that\nyou were soon to be lost to us.'--'Lost indeed!' exclaimed Laura. 'But\nwhat could be my aunt's intention. Surely she cannot still expect to\nprevail with me. My dear friend, if you knew what I have suffered from\nher importunities.--But she has only my advantage in view, though,\nsurely, she widely mistakes the means.'\n\nLaura now frankly informed Mrs De Courcy of the inquietude she had\nsuffered from the persevering remonstrances of Lady Pelham, and the\nobtrusive assiduities of Hargrave. Mrs De Courcy, though she sincerely\npitied the comfortless situation of Laura, listened with pleasure to the\ntale. 'And is all this confidential?' said she, 'so confidential that I\nmust not mention it even to Montague or Harriet?' 'Oh no, indeed,\nMadam,' cried Laura; 'I wish, above all things, that Mr De Courcy should\nknow it; tell him all, Madam; and tell him too, that I would rather be\nin my grave than marry Colonel Hargrave.' Laura had scarcely spoken ere\nshe blushed for the warmth with which she spoke, and Mrs De Courcy's\nsmile made her blush again, and more deeply. But the plea which excused\nher to herself she the next moment urged to her friend. 'Ah, Madam,'\nsaid she, 'if you had witnessed Mr De Courcy's kindness to my father; if\nyou had known how my father loved him, you would not wonder that I am\nanxious for his good opinion.' 'I do not wonder, my love,' said Mrs De\nCourcy, in a tone of heartfelt affection. 'I should be much more\nsurprised if such a mind as yours could undervalue the esteem of a man\nlike Montague. But why did not my sweet Laura take refuge from her\ntormentors at Norwood, where no officious friends, no obtrusive lovers\nwould have disturbed her quiet?'\n\nLaura excused herself, by saying that she was sure her aunt would never\nhave consented to her absence for more than a few hours; but she\npromised, now that Lady Pelham's particular reason for detaining her was\nremoved, that she would endeavour to obtain permission to spend some\ntime at Norwood. 'I fear I must first pay a much less agreeable visit,'\ncontinued Laura, 'for my aunt talks of carrying me to-morrow to the\nhouse of a Mrs Bathurst, of whom you probably have heard.' Mrs De Courcy\nknew that Lady Pelham was on terms of intimacy with Mrs Bathurst, yet\nshe could not help feeling some surprise that she should choose to\nintroduce her niece to such a _chaperon_. She did not, however, think it\nproper, by expressing her opinion, to heighten Laura's reluctance\ntowards what she probably could not prevent; and therefore merely\nexpressed a strong wish that Lady Pelham would permit Laura to spend the\ntime of her absence at Norwood. Laura, though she heartily wished the\nsame, knew her aunt too well to expect that a purpose which she had once\nannounced she would relinquish merely because it would interfere with\nthe inclinations of others. Still it was not impossible that it might be\nrelinquished. A thousand things might happen to alter Lady Pelham's\nresolution, though they were invincible by entreaty. Laura lingered with\nMrs De Courcy for several hours, and when at last she was obliged to go,\nreceived, at parting, many a kind injunction to remember her promised\nvisit. As she bent her steps homeward, she revolved in her mind every\nchance of escape from being the companion of her aunt's journey. She was\nthe more averse to attend Lady Pelham because she conjectured that they\nwould not return before Miss De Courcy's marriage, on which occasion\nLaura was unwilling to be absent. But she was sensible that neither this\nnor any other reason she could urge, would in the least affect Lady\nPelham's motions. Derham Green, the seat of Mrs Bathurst, was above\nninety miles from Walbourne; and it was not likely that Lady Pelham\nwould travel so far with the intention of making a short visit.\n\nLaura had quitted the avenue of Norwood and entered the lane which led\nto that of Walbourne, when the noise of singing, for it could not be\ncalled music, made her look round; and she perceived that she was\novertaken by a figure in a dingy regimental coat, and a rusty hat,\nwhich, however, regained some of its original shade by a contrast with\nthe grey side-locks which blew up a-thwart it. This person was applying\nthe whole force of his lungs to the utterance of 'Hearts of Oak,' in a\nvoice, the masculine bass of which was at times oddly interrupted by the\nweak treble tones of age, while, with a large crabstick, he beat time\nagainst the sides of a starveling ass upon which he was mounted. The\nother hand was charged with the double employment of guiding the animal,\nand of balancing a large portmanteau, which was placed across its\nshoulders. Laura, retaining the habits of her country, addressed the man\nwith a few words of courtesy, to which he replied with the frankness and\ngarrulity of an old Englishman; and as they proceeded at much the same\npace, they continued the conversation. It was, however, soon\ninterrupted. At the gate of a grass field, with which the ass seemed\nacquainted, the creature made a full stop.--'Get on,' cried the man,\nstriking it with his heel. It would not stir. The rider applied the\ncrabstick more vigorously than before. It had no effect; even an ass can\ndespise the chastisement with which it is too familiar. The contention\nwas obstinate; neither party seemed inclined to yield. At last fortune\ndecided in favour of the ass. The portmanteau slipped from its balance,\nand fell to the ground. The man looked dolefully at it. 'How the plague\nshall I get it up again?' said he. 'Don't dismount,' said Laura, who now\nfirst observed that her companion had but one leg--'I can lift it up for\nyou.'\n\nAs she raised it, Laura observed that it was directed to Mr Jones, at\nSquire Bathurst's, Derham Green, ----shire. Though the name was too\ncommon to excite any suspicion, the address struck her as being the same\nplace which had so lately occupied her thoughts. 'Have you far to go,'\nsaid she to the man. 'No, Ma'am,' answered he, 'only to Job Wilson, the\ncarrier's, with this portmanteau, for Colonel Hargrave's gentleman. The\nColonel took Mr Jones with himself in the chay, but he had only room for\none or two of his boxes, so he left this with the groom, and the groom\ngave me a pot of porter to go with it.'\n\nThe whole affair was now clear. Lady Pelham, finding Laura unmanageable\nat home, was contriving that she should meet Colonel Hargrave at a place\nwhere, being among strangers, she would find it less possible to avoid\nhim. Mrs Bathurst too was probably a good convenient friend, who would\ncountenance whatever measures were thought necessary. In the first burst\nof indignation at the discovery of her aunt's treachery, Laura thought\nof retracing her steps to Norwood, never more to enter the presence of\nher unworthy relation; but, resentment cooling at the recollection of\nthe benefits she owed to Lady Pelham, she determined on returning to\nWalbourne, to announce in person her refusal to go with her aunt;\nconceiving this to be the most respectful way of intimating her\nintentions.\n\nAs soon as she returned home she retired to her chamber without seeing\nLady Pelham; and immediately dispatched the following note to Mrs De\nCourcy. 'My dear Madam, an accident has happened which determines me\nagainst going to Derham Green. Will you think I presume too soon on your\nkind invitation, if I say that I shall see you to-morrow at breakfast?\nOr will not your benevolence rather acquire a new motive in the\nshelterless condition which awaits your very affectionate L.M.'\n\nShe then proceeded to make arrangements for her departure, reflecting,\nwith tears, on the hard necessity which was about to set her at variance\nwith the only living relation who had ever acknowledged her. She knew\nthat Lady Pelham would be enraged at the frustration of a scheme, to\naccomplish which she had stooped to such artifice; and she feared that,\nhowever gentle might be the terms of her intended refusal, her aunt\nwould consider it as unpardonable rebellion. She was, however, firmly\nresolved against compliance, and all that remained was to use the least\nirritating mode of denial.\n\nThey met at dinner. Lady Pelham in high good humour, Laura grave and\nthoughtful. Lady Pelham mentioned her journey; but, dreading to rouse\nher aunt's unwearied power's of objurgation, Laura kept silence; and her\njust displeasure rendering her averse to Lady Pelham's company, she\ncontrived to spend the evening alone.\n\nAs the supper hour approached, Laura began to tremble for the contest\nwhich awaited her. She felt herself more than half inclined to withdraw\nfrom the storm, by departing without warning, and leaving Lady Pelham to\ndiscover the reason of her flight after she was beyond the reach of her\nfury. But she considered that such a proceeding must imply an\nirreconcilable breach with one to whom she owed great and substantial\nobligations; and would carry an appearance of ingratitude which she\ncould not bear to incur. Summoning her courage, therefore, she resolved\nto brave the tempest. She determined, that whatever provocation she\nmight endure, she would offer none but such as was unavoidable; though,\nat the same time, she would maintain that spirit which she had always\nfound the most effectual check to her aunt's violence.\n\nThe supper passed in quiet; Laura unwilling to begin the attack; Lady\nPelham glorying in her expected success. Her Ladyship had taken her\ncandle, and was about to retire, before Laura durst venture on the\nsubject. 'Good night, my dear,' said Lady Pelham. 'I fear,' replied\nLaura, 'I may rather say farewell, since it will be so long ere I see\nyou again.' 'How do you mean!' inquired Lady Pelham. 'That I cannot\naccompany you to Mrs Bathurst's,' replied Laura; fetching, at the close\nof her speech, a breath longer than the speech itself. 'You won't go?'\nexclaimed Lady Pelham, in a voice of angry astonishment. 'Since it is\nyour wish that I should,' returned Laura meekly, 'I am sorry that it is\nnot in my power.' 'And pray what puts it out of your power?' cried Lady\nPelham, wrath working in her countenance. 'I cannot go where I am to\nmeet Colonel Hargrave.' For a moment Lady Pelham looked confounded, but\npresently recovering utterance, she began--'So! this is your Norwood\nintelligence; and your charming Mrs De Courcy--your model of\nperfection--sets spies upon the conduct of all the neighbourhood!'\n\nLaura reddened at this vulgar abuse of the woman on earth whom she most\nrevered; but she had set a guard on her temper, and only answered, that\nit was not at Norwood she received her information. 'A fortunate, I\nshould rather say a providential accident,' said she, 'disclosed to me\nthe whole'--the word 'strategem' was rising to her lips, but she\nexchanged it for one less offensive.\n\n'And what if Colonel Hargrave is to be there?' said Lady Pelham, her\ncholer rising as her confusion subsided. 'I suppose, forsooth, my pretty\nprudish Miss cannot trust herself in the house with a man!' 'Not with\nColonel Hargrave, Madam,' said Laura coolly.\n\nLady Pelham's rage was now strong enough to burst the restraints of\nLaura's habitual ascendancy. 'But I say you shall go, Miss,' cried she\nin a scream that mingled the fierceness of anger with the insolence of\ncommand. 'Yes I say you shall go; we shall see whether I am always to\ntruckle to a baby-faced chit, a creature that might have died in a\nworkhouse but for my charity.' 'Indeed, Madam,' said Laura, 'I do not\nforget--I never shall forget--what I owe you; nor that when I was\nshelterless and unprotected, you received and cherished me.' 'Then shew\nthat you remember it, and do what I desire,' returned Lady Pelham,\nsoftened in spite of herself, by the resistless sweetness of Laura's\nlook and manner. 'Do not, I beseech you, Madam,' said Laura, 'insist\nupon this proof of my gratitude. If you do, I can only thank you for\nyour past kindness, and wish that it had been in my power to make a\nbetter return.' 'Do you dare to tell me that you will not go?' cried\nLady Pelham, stamping till the room shook. 'I beg, Madam,' said Laura\nentreatingly, 'I beg of you not to command what I shall be compelled to\nrefuse.' 'Refuse at your peril!' shrieked Lady Pelham, in a voice scarce\narticulate with passion, and grasping Laura's arm in the convulsion of\nher rage.\n\nLaura had some times been the witness, but seldom the object of her\naunt's transports; and while Lady Pelham stood eyeing her with a\ncountenance 'fierce as ten furies,' she, conscious with what burning\nshame she would herself have shrunk from making such an exhibition,\nsympathetically averted her eyes as if the virago had been sensible of\nthe same feeling. 'I say refuse at your peril!' cried Lady Pelham.--'Why\ndon't you speak? obstinate'--'Because,' answered Laura with saintlike\nmeekness, 'I can say nothing but what will offend you--I cannot go to\nMrs Bathurst's.'\n\nAngry opposition Lady Pelham might have retorted with some small remains\nof self-possession, but the serenity of Laura exasperating her beyond\nall bounds, she was so far transported as to strike her a violent blow.\nWithout uttering a syllable, Laura took her candle and quitted the room;\nwhile Lady Pelham, herself confounded at the outrage she had committed,\nmade no attempt to detain her.\n\nLaura retired to her chamber, and sat quietly down to consider the state\nof her warfare, which she determined to conclude by letter, without\nexposing her person to another assault; but in a few minutes she was\nstormed in her citadel, and the enemy entered, conscious of mistake, but\nwith spirit unbroken. Lady Pelham had gone too far to retract, and was\ntoo much in the wrong to recant her error; her passion, however, had\nsomewhat exhausted itself in the intemperate exercise which she had\nallowed it; and though as unreasonable as ever, she was less outrageous.\nAdvancing towards Laura with an air intended to express offended majesty\n(for studied dignity is generally the disguise chosen by conscious\ndegradation), she began, 'Miss Montreville, do you, in defiance of my\ncommands, adhere to your resolution of not visiting Mrs Bathurst?'\n'Certainly, Madam;' replied Laura, provoked that Lady Pelham should\nexpect to intimidate her by a blow; 'I have seen no reason to relinquish\nit.'--'There is a reason, however,' returned Lady Pelham, elevating her\nchin, curling her upper lip, and giving Laura the side-glance of\ndisdain, 'though probably it is too light to weigh with such a\ndetermined lady, and that is, that you must either prepare to attend me\nto-morrow, or return to that beggary from which I took you, and never\nmore enter my presence.' 'Then, Madam,' said Laura, rising with her\nnative mien of calm command, 'we must part; for I cannot go to Mrs\nBathurst's.'\n\nLaura's cool resistance of a threat which was expected to be all\npowerful, discomposed Lady Pelham's heroics. Her eyes flashing fire, and\nher voice sharpening to a scream, 'Perverse ungrateful wretch!' she\ncried, 'Get out of my sight--leave my house this instant.' 'Certainly,\nif you desire it, Madam,' answered Laura, with unmoved self-possession;\n'but, perhaps, if you please, I had better remain here till morning. I\nam afraid it might give rise to unpleasant observations if it were known\nthat I left your house at midnight.'\n\n'I care not who knows it--I would have the world see what a viper I have\nfostered in my bosom. Begone, and never let me see your hypocritical\nface again.'\n\n'Then I hope,' said Laura, 'your Ladyship will allow a servant to\naccompany me to Norwood. At this hour it would be improper for me to go\nalone.' 'Oh to be sure,' cried Lady Pelham, 'do go to your friend and\nfavourite and make your complaint of all your harsh usage, and descant\nat large upon poor Lady Pelham's unlucky failings. No, no, I promise\nyou, no servant of mine shall be sent on any such errand.' 'There is\nfine moonlight,' said Laura looking calmly from the window, 'I dare say\nI shall be safe enough alone.' 'You shall not go to Norwood!' cried Lady\nPelham--'I'll take care to keep you from that prying, censorious old\nhag. You two shan't be allowed to sit primming up your mouths, and\nspitting venom on all the neighbourhood.' Weary of such low abuse, Laura\ntook her bonnet, and was leaving the room. Lady Pelham placed herself\nbetween her and the door. 'Where are you going?' she demanded, in a\nvoice in which rage was a little mingled with dread. 'To the only\nshelter that England affords me,' returned Laura; 'to the only friends\nfrom whom death or distance does not sever me.' 'I shall spoil your dish\nof scandal for to-night, however,' said Lady Pelham, flouncing out of\nthe room; and, slapping the door with a force that made the windows\nrattle, she locked it on the outside. Laura making no attempt to obtain\nrelease, quietly sat down expecting a renewal of the charge. Soon,\nhowever, all the household seemed still, and Laura having mingled with\nthe prayer that commended herself to the care of heaven, a supplication\nfor pardon and amendment to her aunt, retired to sound and refreshing\nrest.\n\nOn quitting Laura, Lady Pelham went to bed, pride and anger in her\nbreast fiercely struggling against a sense of blame. But the darkness,\nthe silence, the loneliness of night assuage the passions even of a\ntermagant; and by degrees she turned from re-acting and excusing her\nconduct, to fretting at its probable consequences.\n\nThe courage of a virago is no more than the daring of intoxication. Wait\ntill the paroxysms be past, and the timid hare is not more the slave of\nfear. Lady Pelham began to feel, though she would scarcely acknowledge\nit to herself, how very absurdly her contest would figure in the mouths\nof the gossips round Walbourne. If her niece left her house in\ndispleasure, if a breach were known to subsist between them, was it not\nmost likely that Laura would in her own defence relate the treatment to\nwhich she had been subjected? At all events, if she went to Norwood\nbefore a reconciliation took place, she would certainly explain her\nsituation to Mrs De Courcy; and Lady Pelham could not brave the contempt\nof the woman whom she disliked and abused. Anger has been compared to a\nshort madness, and the resemblance holds in this respect, that in both\ncases, a little terror is of sovereign use in restoring quiet. Lady\nPelham even feared the calm displeasure of Laura, and shrunk from\nmeeting the reproving eye of even the dependent girl whom she had\npersecuted and reproached and insulted. By degrees, Laura's habitual\nascendancy was completely restored, perhaps with added strength for its\nmomentary suspension; for she had rather gained in respectability by\npatient endurance, while Lady Pelham was somewhat humbled by a sense of\nmisconduct. Besides, in the course of eight months residence under her\nroof, Laura was become necessary to her aunt. Her prudence, her good\ntemper, her various domestic talents, were ever at hand to supply the\ncapital defects of Lady Pelham's character. Lady Pelham could not justly\nbe said to love any mortal, but she felt the advantages of the method\nand regularity which Laura had introduced into her family; Laura's\nbeauty gratified her vanity; Laura's sweetness bore with her caprice;\nLaura's talents amused her solitude; and she made as near an approach as\nnature would permit to loving Laura. What was of more consequence, Laura\nwas popular in the neighbourhood; her story would be no sooner told than\nbelieved; and Lady Pelham's lively imagination strongly represented to\nher the aggravation, commentary, and sarcasm, with which such an\nanecdote would be circulated.\n\nBut though these ideas floated in Lady Pelham's mind, let it not be\nthought that she once supposed them to be the motives of her\ndetermination to seek a reconcilement! No. Lady Pelham had explained,\nand disguised, and adorned her failings, till she had converted the\nnatural shame of confession into a notion that a candid avowal atoned\nfor any of her errors; and no sooner did she begin to think of making\nconcessions to her niece, than the consciousness of blame was lost in\ninward applause of her own candour and condescension. An observing eye,\ntherefore, would have seen more of conceit than of humility in her air,\nwhen early in the morning, she entered Laura's apartment. Laura was\nalready dressed, and returned her aunt's salutation more coldly than she\nhad ever formerly done, though with perfect good humour. Lady Pelham\napproached and took her hand; Laura did not withdraw it. 'I fear,' said\nLady Pelham, 'you think I behaved very absurdly last night.' Laura\nlooked down and said nothing. 'I am willing to own I was to blame,'\ncontinued her Ladyship, 'but people of strong feelings, you know, my\ndear, cannot always command themselves.' Laura was still silent. 'We\nmust forgive and forget the failings of our friends,' proceeded her\nLadyship. Laura, who dreaded that these overtures of peace only covered\na projected attack, still stood speechless. 'Will you not forgive me,\nLaura?' said Lady Pelham coaxingly, her desire of pardon increasing, as\nshe began to doubt of obtaining it. 'I do, Madam,' said Laura, clasping\nLady Pelham's hand between her own. 'I do from my heart forgive all, and\nif you will permit me, I will forget all--all but that when I was an\norphan, alone in the wide world, you sheltered and protected me.' 'Thank\nyou, my good girl,' returned Lady Pelham, sealing the reconciliation\nwith a kiss. 'I knew you would think it a duty to excuse an error\narising merely from my natural warmth, and the interest I take in\nyou--\"A bad effect from a noble cause.\" It is a melancholy truth that\nthose who have the advantages of a feeling heart, must share its\nweaknesses too.' Laura had so often listened to similar nonsense, that\nit had ceased to provoke a smile. 'Let us talk of this no more,' said\nshe; 'let me rather try to persuade you not only to excuse, but to\nsanction the obstinacy that offended you.' 'Ah Laura,' returned Lady\nPelham, smiling, 'I must not call you obstinate, but you are very firm.\nIf I could but prevail on you to go with me only for a day or two, I\nshould make my visit as short as you please; for now it has been all\narranged I must go, and it would look so awkward to go without you!' 'If\nthe length of your visit depend upon me,' answered Laura, waving a\nsubject on which she was determined not to forfeit her character for\nfirmness, 'it shall be short indeed, for I shall long to offer some\nreparation for all my late perverseness and disobedience.'\n\nAt another time Lady Pelham's temper would have failed her at this\nsteady opposition of her will; but fear kept her in check. After a few\nvery gentle expostulations, she gave up the point, and inquired whether\nher niece still intended to spend the time of her absence at Norwood.\nLaura answered that she did; and had promised to breakfast there that\nmorning. Upon this Lady Pelham overwhelmed her with such caresses and\nendearments, as she intended should obliterate the remembrance of her\nlate injurious behaviour. She extolled Laura's prudence, her sweet and\nforgiving disposition, her commendable reserve with strangers, and her\ncaution in speaking of herself or of her own affairs. Unfortunately for\nthe effect of the flattery, Laura recollected that some of these\nqualities had at times been the subject of Lady Pelham's severe\nreprehension. She had, besides, sufficient penetration to detect the\nmotive of her Ladyship's altered language; and she strove to suppress a\nfeeling of contempt, while she replied to her aunt's thoughts as freely\nas if they had been frankly spoken; assuring her that she should be far\nfrom publishing to strangers the casual vexations of her domestic life.\nLady Pelham reddened, as her latent thoughts were thus seized and\nexposed naked to her view; but fear again proved victorious, and she\nredoubled her blandishments. She even had recourse to a new expedient,\nand for the first time made Laura an offer of money. With infinite\ndifficulty did Laura suppress the indignation which swelled her breast.\nShe had forgiven abuse and insult, but it was beyond endurance that her\naunt should suppose that her pardon and silence might be bought.\nRestraining her anger, however, she positively refused the money; and\nbidding Lady Pelham farewell, departed, amidst pressing injunctions to\nremain at Norwood no longer than till her aunt returned to Walbourne;\nher Ladyship protesting that her own home would not be endurable for an\nhour without the company of her dear Laura.\n\nLady Pelham unwillingly set out on a journey of which the first\nintention had been totally defeated; but she had no alternative, since,\nbesides having promised to visit Mrs Bathurst, she had made an\nappointment to meet Hargrave at the stage where she was to stop for the\nnight, and it was now too late to give him warning of his\ndisappointment. Even Hargrave's politeness was no match for his\nvexation, when he saw Lady Pelham, late in the evening, alight from her\ncarriage, unaccompanied by Laura. He listened with impatience to her\nLadyship's apology and confused explanations; and more than half\nresolved upon returning to -- to carry on his operations there. But he\ntoo had promised to Mrs Bathurst, whom for particular reasons he wished\nnot to disoblige. The travellers, therefore, next day pursued their\njourney to Derham Green, beguiling the way by joint contrivances to\nconquer the stubbornness of Laura.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nLaura had proceeded but a short way towards Norwood when she was met by\nDe Courcy, who, with a manner the most opposite to his coldness on the\npreceding day, sprang forward to meet her, his countenance radiant with\npleasure. Laura, delighted with the change, playfully reproached him\nwith his caprice. Montague coloured, but defended himself with spirit;\nand a dialogue, more resembling flirtation than any in which Laura had\never engaged, occupied them till, as they loitered along the dark avenue\nof Norwood, a shade of the sentimental began to mingle with their\nconversation. De Courcy had that morning resolved, firmly resolved, that\nwhile Laura was his guest at Norwood, he would avoid a declaration of\nhis sentiments. Convinced, as he now was, that he no longer had any\nthing to fear from the perseverance of Hargrave, he was yet far from\nbeing confident of his own success. On the contrary, he was persuaded\nthat he had hitherto awakened in Laura no sentiment beyond friendship,\nand that she must become accustomed to him as a lover, before he could\nhope for any farther grace. He considered how embarrassing would be her\nsituation in a house of which the master was a repulsed, perhaps a\nrejected, admirer; and he had determined not to hazard embittering to\nher a residence from which she had at present no retreat. Yet the\nconfiding manner, the bewitching loveliness of Laura, the stillness,\nshade, and solitude of their path had half-beguiled him of his prudence,\nwhen, fortunately for his resolution, he saw Harriet advancing to meet\nher friend. Harriet's liveliness soon restored gaiety to the\nconversation; and the party proceeded less leisurely than before to\nNorwood, where Laura was received with affectionate cordiality by Mrs De\nCourcy.\n\nNever had the time appeared to Laura to fly so swiftly as now. Every\nhour was sacred to improvement, to elegance, or to benevolence. Laura\nhad a mind capable of intense application; and therefore could exalt\nrelaxation into positive enjoyment. But the pleasure which a vigorous\nunderstanding takes in the exercise of its powers, was now heightened in\nher hours of study, by the assistance, the approbation of De Courcy; and\nthe hours of relaxation he enlivened by a manner which, at once frank\nand respectful, spirited and kind, seemed peculiarly fitted to adorn the\ndomestic circle. A part of each day was employed by Mrs De Courcy in\nvarious works of charity; and, joining in these, Laura returned with\nsatisfaction to a habit which she had unwillingly laid aside during her\nresidence in London, and but imperfectly resumed at Walbourne. Amiable,\nrational, and pious, the family at Norwood realized all Laura's\nday-dreams of social happiness; and the only painful feeling that\nassailed her mind arose from the recollection that the time of her visit\nwas fast stealing away. Her visit was, however, prolonged by a fortunate\ncold which detained Lady Pelham at Derham Green; and Laura could not\nregret an accident which delayed her separation from her friends. Indeed\nshe began to dread Lady Pelham's return, both as the signal of her\ndeparture from Norwood, and as a prelude to the renewal of her\npersecutions on account of Hargrave. Far from having, as Lady Pelham had\ninsinuated, renounced his pursuit, he returned in a few days from Mrs\nBathurst's; again established himself with Lambert; and, though he could\nnot uninvited intrude himself into Norwood, contrived to beset Laura as\noften as she passed its bounds. In the few visits which she paid, she\ngenerally encountered him; and he regularly waylaid her at church. But\nhe had lost an able coadjutor in Lady Pelham; and now, when no one\npresent was concerned to assist his designs, and when Laura was\nprotected by kind and considerate friends, she generally found means to\nescape his officious attentions; though, remembering his former jealousy\nof Montague, and the irritability of his temper, she was scrupulously\ncautious of marking her preference of De Courcy, or of appearing to take\nsanctuary with him from the assiduities of Hargrave. Indeed,\nnotwithstanding the mildness of De Courcy's disposition, she was not\nwithout fear that he might be involved in a quarrel by the unreasonable\nsuspicions of Hargrave, who had often taxed her with receiving his\naddresses, ascribing his own failure to their success. She had in vain\ncondescended to assure him that the charge was groundless. He never met\nDe Courcy without shewing evident marks of dislike. If he accosted him,\nit was in a tone and manner approaching to insult. The most trivial\nsentence which De Courcy addressed to Laura, drew from Hargrave looks of\nenmity and defiance; while Montague, on his part, returned these\naggressions by a cool disdain, the most opposite to the conciliating\nfrankness of his general manners. Laura's alarm lest Hargrave's\nill-concealed aversion should burst into open outrage, completed the\ndread with which he inspired her; and she felt like one subjected to the\nthraldom of an evil genius, when he one day announced to her that he had\nprocured leave to remove his regiment to --; in order, as he said, 'that\nhe might be at hand to assert his rights over her.'\n\nHe conveyed this information as, rudely preventing Mr Bolingbroke and De\nCourcy, he led her from Mrs De Courcy's carriage into church. Laura\ndurst not challenge his presumptuous expression, for Montague was close\nby her side, and she dreaded that his aversion to arrogance and\noppression should induce him to engage in her quarrel. Silently\ntherefore, though glowing with resentment, she suffered Hargrave to\nretain the place he had usurped, while Montague followed, with a\ncountenance which a few short moments had clouded with sudden care.\n'Ah,' thought he, 'those rights must indeed be strong which he dares\nthus boldly, thus publickly assert.' It was some time ere the service\nbegan, and Laura could not help casting glances of kind inquiry on the\nsaddened face, which, a few minutes before, she had seen bright with\nanimation and delight. Hargrave's eye followed her's with a far\ndifferent expression. While she observed him darting a scowl of malice\nand aversion on the man to whom he owed his life, Laura shuddered; and\nwondering at the infatuation which had so long disguised his true\ncharacter, bent her head, acknowledged her short-sightedness, and\nresigned the future events of her life to the disposal of heaven. It was\nthe day immediately preceding Harriet's marriage, and neither she nor\nMrs De Courcy was in church; Laura therefore returned home t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate\nwith Montague. Ignorant that Hargrave's provoking half-whisper had been\noverheard by De Courcy, she could not account for the sudden change in\nhis countenance and manner; yet though she took an affectionate interest\nin his melancholy, they had almost reached home before she summoned\ncourage to inquire into its cause. 'I fear you are indisposed,' said she\nto him in a voice of kind concern. De Courcy thanked her. 'No, not\nindisposed,' said he, with a faint smile. 'Disturbed, then,' said Laura.\nDe Courcy was silent for a moment, and then taking her hand, said, 'May\nI be candid with you?' 'Surely,' returned Laura. 'I trust I shall ever\nmeet with candour in you.' 'Then I will own,' resumed De Courcy, 'that I\nam disturbed. And can the friend of Montreville be otherwise when he\nhears a right claimed over you by one so wholly unworthy of you?' 'Ah,'\ncried Laura, 'you have then heard all. I hoped you had not attended to\nhim.' 'Attended!' exclaimed De Courcy, 'Could any right be claimed over\nyou and I be regardless?' 'It were ungrateful to doubt your friendly\ninterest in me,' replied Laura. 'Believe me Colonel Hargrave has no\nright over me, nor ever shall have.' 'Yet I did not hear you resist the\nclaim,' returned De Courcy. 'Because,' answered Laura, 'I feared to draw\nyour attention. His violence terrifies me, and I feared that--that you\nmight'--She hesitated, stopped, and blushed very deeply. She felt the\nawkwardness of appearing to expect that De Courcy should engage in a\nquarrel on her account, but the simple truth ever rose so naturally to\nher lips, that she could not even qualify it without confusion. 'Might\nwhat?' cried De Courcy eagerly; 'Speak frankly I beseech you.' 'I\nfeared,' replied Laura, recovering herself, 'that the interest you take\nin the daughter of your friend might expose you to the rudeness of this\noverbearing man.' 'And did you upon my account, dearest Laura, submit to\nthis insolence?' cried De Courcy, his eyes sparkling with exultation.\n'Is my honour, my safety then dear to you? Could you think of me even\nwhile Hargrave spoke!' With surprise and displeasure Laura read the\ntriumphant glance which accompanied his words. 'Is it possible,' thought\nshe, 'that, well as he knows me, he can thus mistake the nature of my\nregard! or can he, attached to another, find pleasure in the idle dream.\nOh man! thou art altogether vanity!' Snatching away the hand which he\nwas pressing to his lips, she coldly replied, 'I should have been\nequally attentive to the safety of any common stranger had I expected\nhis interference, and Colonel Hargrave's speeches cannot divert my\nattention even from the most trivial object in nature.' Poor De Courcy,\nhis towering hopes suddenly levelled with the dust, shrunk from the\nfrozen steadiness of her eye. 'Pardon me, Miss Montreville,' said he in\na tone of mingled sorrow and reproach, 'pardon me for the hope that you\nwould make any distinction between me and the most indifferent. I shall\nsoon be cured of my presumption.' Grieved at the pain she saw she had\noccasioned, Laura would fain have said something to mitigate the repulse\nwhich she had given: but a new light began to dawn upon her, and she\nfeared to conciliate the friend lest she should encourage the lover.\nFortunately for the relief of her embarrassment the carriage stopped. De\nCourcy gravely and in silence handed her from it; and, hurrying to her\nchamber, she sat down to reconsider the dialogue she had just ended.\n\nDe Courcy's manner more than his words recalled a suspicion which she\nhad oftener than once driven from her mind. She was impressed, she\nscarcely knew why, with a conviction that she was beloved. For some\nminutes this idea alone filled her thoughts; the next that succeeded was\nrecollection that she ought sincerely to lament a passion which she\ncould not return. It was her duty to be sorry, very sorry indeed, for\nsuch an accident; to be otherwise would have argued the most selfish\nvanity, the most hard-hearted ingratitude towards the best of friends,\nand the most amiable of mankind. Yet she was not _very_ sorry; it was\nout of her power to convince herself that she was; so she imputed her\nphilosophy under her misfortune to doubtfulness of its existence. 'But\nafter all,' said she to herself, 'his words could not bear such a\nconstruction; and for his manner--who would build any thing upon a\nmanner! While a woman's vanity is so apt to deceive her, what rational\ncreature would give credit to what may owe so much to her own\nimagination! Besides, did not Mrs De Courcy more than hint that his\naffections were engaged. Did he not even himself confess to me that they\nwere. And I taxed him with vanity!--Truly, if he could see this\nridiculous freak of mine he might very justly retort the charge. And see\nit he will. What could possess me with my absurd prudery to take offence\nat his expecting that I, who owe him ten thousand kind offices, should\nbe anxious for his safety?--How could I be so false, so thankless as to\nsay I considered him as a common acquaintance?--The friend of my father,\nmy departed father! the friend who supported him in want, and consoled\nhim in sorrow! No wonder that he seemed shocked! What is so painful to a\nnoble heart as to meet with ingratitude? But he shall never again have\nreason to think me vain or ungrateful;' and Laura hastened down stairs\nthat she might lose no time in convincing De Courcy that she did not\nsuspect him of being her lover, and highly valued him as a friend. She\nfound him in the drawing-room, pensively resting his forehead against\nthe window sash; and approaching him, spoke some trifle with a smile so\nwinning, so gracious, that De Courcy soon forgot both his wishes and his\nfears, enjoyed the present, and was happy.\n\nThe day of Harriet's marriage arrived; and for once she was grave and\nsilent. She even forgot her bridal finery; and when Laura went to inform\nher of Mr Bolingbroke's arrival, she found her in the library, sitting\non the ground in tears, her head resting on the seat of an old-fashioned\nelbow chair. She sprang up as Laura entered; and dashing the drops from\nher eyes, cried, 'I have been trying to grow young again for a few\nminutes, before I am made an old woman for life. Just there I used to\nsit when I was a little little thing, and laid my head upon my father's\nknee; for this was his favourite chair, and there old Rover and I used\nto lie at his feet together. I'll beg this chair of my mother, for now I\nlove every thing at Norwood.' Laura drew her away, and she forgot the\nold elbow-chair when she saw the superb diamonds which were lying on her\ndressing-table. The ceremonial of the wedding was altogether adjusted by\nMrs Penelope; and though, in compliance with Mr Bolingbroke's whims, she\nsuffered the ceremony to be privately performed, she invited every\ncreature who could claim kindred with the names of Bolingbroke or De\nCourcy to meet and welcome the young bride to her home. Mr Bolingbroke\nhaving brought a licence, the pair were united at Norwood. Mr Wentworth\nofficiated, and De Courcy gave his sister away. Mrs Bolingbroke's own\nnew barouche, so often beheld in fancy, now really waited to convey her\nto her future dwelling; but she turned to bid farewell to the domestics\nwho had attended her infancy, and forgot to look at the new barouche.\n\nMr Bolingbroke was a great man, and could not be allowed to marry\nquietly. Bonfires were lighted, bells were rung, and a concourse of his\ntenantry accompanied the carriages which conveyed the party. The\nadmiration of the company whom Mrs Penelope had assembled in honour of\nthe day, was divided between Mrs Bolingbroke's diamonds and her\nbride-maid; and as the number of each sex was pretty equal, the wonders\nshared pretty equally.\n\n'Did you ever see any thing so lovely as Miss Montreville?' said Sophia\nBolingbroke to the young lady who sat next her. 'I never can think any\nbody pretty who has red hair,' was the reply. 'If her hair be red,'\nreturned Sophia, 'it is the most pardonable red hair in the world, for\nit is more nearly black. Don't you admire her figure?' 'Not\nparticularly; she is too much of the May-pole for me; besides, who can\ntell what her figure is when she is so muffled up. I dare say she is\nstuffed, or she would shew a little more of her skin.' 'She has at least\nan excellent taste in stuffing, then,' said Sophia, 'for I never saw any\nthing so elegantly formed.' 'It is easy to see,' said the critic, 'that\nshe thinks herself a beauty by her dressing so affectedly. To-night\nwhen every body else is in full dress, do but look at her's!' 'Pure,\nunadorned, virgin white,' said Miss Bolingbroke, looking at Laura; 'the\nproper attire of angels!' The name of Miss Montreville had drawn the\nattention of De Courcy to this dialogue. 'I protest,' cried he to Mr\nWentworth, who stood by him. 'Sophy Bolingbroke is the most agreeable\nplain girl I ever saw.' He then placed himself by her side; and while\nshe continued to praise Laura, gave her credit for all that is most\namiable in woman.\n\nThe moment he left her she ran to rally Laura upon her conquest. 'I give\nyou joy, my dear,' said she, 'De Courcy is certainly in love with you.'\n'Nonsense,' cried Laura, colouring crimson; 'what can make you think\nso?' 'Why he will talk of nothing but you, and he looked so delighted\nwhen I praised you; and paid me more compliments in half an hour than\nere I received in my whole life before.' 'If he was so complimentary,'\nsaid Laura, smiling, 'it seems more likely that he is in love with you.'\n'Ah,' said Sophia, sighing, 'that is not very probable.' 'Full as\nprobable as the other,' answered Laura; and turned away to avoid a\nsubject which she was striving to banish from her thoughts.\n\nDuring the few days which Laura and the De Courcys spent with the\nnewly-married pair, Miss Bolingbroke's observations served to confirm\nher opinion; and merely for the pleasure of speaking of Montague, she\nrallied Laura incessantly on her lover. In weighing credibilities, small\nweight of testimony turns the scale; and Laura began alternately to\nwonder what retarded De Courcy's declaration, and to tax herself with\nvanity in expecting that he would ever make one. She disliked her stay\nat Orfordhall, and counted the hours till her return to Norwood. De\nCourcy's attentions she had long placed to the account of a regard\nwhich, while she was permitted to give it the name of friendship, she\ncould frankly own that she valued above any earthly possessions. These\nattentions were now so familiar to her, that they were become almost\nnecessary, and she was vexed at being constantly reminded that she ought\nto reject them. She had therefore a latent wish to return to a place\nwhere she would have a legitimate claim to his kindness, and where at\nleast there would be no one to remind her that she ought to shrink from\nit. Besides, she was weary of the state and magnificence that surrounded\nher. While Harriet glided into the use of her finery as if she had been\naccustomed to it from her cradle, Laura could by no means be reconciled\nto it. She endured with impatience a meal of three hours long; could\nnot eat while six footmen were staring at her; started, if she\nthoughtlessly leant her head against the white damask wall; and could\nnot move with ease, where every gesture was repeated in endless\nlooking-glasses. With pleasure, therefore, she saw the day arrive which\nwas to restore her to easy hospitality, and respectable simplicity at\nNorwood; but that very day she received a summons to attend her aunt at\nWalbourne.\n\nUnwilling as Laura was to quit her friends, she did not delay to comply\nwith Lady Pelham's requisition. Mrs De Courcy judged it improper to urge\nher to stay; and Montague in part consoled himself for her departure, by\nreflecting, that he would now be at liberty to disclose his\nlong-concealed secret. 'No doubt you are at liberty,' said Mrs De\nCourcy, when he spoke to her of his intentions, 'and I am far from\npretending to advise or interfere. But, my dear Montague, you must\nneither be surprised, nor in despair, if you be at first unsuccessful.\nThough Laura esteems you, perhaps more than esteems you, she is\nconvinced that she is invulnerable to love; and it may be so, but her\nfancied security is all in your favour.' Weary of suspense, however, De\nCourcy often resolved to know his fate; and often went to Walbourne,\ndetermined to learn ere he returned, whether a circle of pleasing duties\nwas to fill his after life, or whether it was to be spent alone,\n'loveless, joyless, unendeared;' but when he met the friendly smile of\nLaura, and remembered that, his secret told, it might vanish like the\ngleaming of a wintry sun, his courage failed, and the intended\ndisclosure was again delayed. Yet his manner grew less and less\nequivocal, and Laura, unwilling as she was to own the conviction to\nherself, could scarcely maintain her wilful blindness.\n\nShe allowed the subject to occupy the more of her thoughts, because it\ncame disguised in a veil of self-condemnation and humility. Sometimes\nshe repeated to herself, that she should never have known the vanity of\nher own heart, had it not been visited by so absurd a suspicion; and\nsometimes that she should never have been acquainted with its\nselfishness and obduracy, had she not borne with such indifference, the\nthoughts of what must bring pain and disappointment to so worthy a\nbreast. But, spite of Laura's efforts to be miserable, the subject cost\nher much more perplexity than distress; and, in wondering whether De\nCourcy really were her lover, and what could be his motive for\nconcealing it if he were, she often forgot to deplore the consequences\nof her charms.\n\nMeanwhile Hargrave continued his importunities; and Lady Pelham seconded\nthem with unwearied perseverance. In vain did Laura protest that her\nindifference was unconquerable; in vain assure him that though a total\nrevolution in his character might regain her esteem, her affection was\nirrecoverably lost. She could at any time exasperate the proud spirit of\nHargrave, till in transports of fury he would abjure her for ever; but a\nfew hours always brought the 'for ever' to an end, and Hargrave back, to\nsupplicate, to importune, and not unfrequently to threaten. Though her\nunremitting coldness, however, failed to conquer his passion, it by\ndegrees extinguished all of generous or kindly that had ever mingled\nwith the flame; and the wild unholy fire which her beauty kept alive,\nwas blended with the heart-burnings of anger and revenge. From such a\npassion Laura shrunk with dread and horror. She heard its expressions as\nsuperstitution listens to sounds of evil omen; and saw his impassioned\nglances with the dread of one who meets the eye of the crouching tiger.\nHis increasing jealousy of De Courcy, which testified itself in\nhaughtiness, and even ferocity of behaviour towards him, and Montague's\ndetermined though cool resistance of his insolence, kept her in\ncontinual alarm. Though she never on any other occasion voluntarily\nentered Hargrave's presence, yet if De Courcy found him at Walbourne,\nshe would hasten to join them, fearing the consequences of a private\ninterview between two such hostile spirits; and this apparent preference\nnot only aggravated the jealousy of Hargrave, but aroused Lady Pelham's\nindefatigable spirit of remonstrance. The subject was particularly\nsuited for an episode to her Ladyship's harangues in favour of Hargrave;\nand she introduced and varied it with a dexterity all her own. She taxed\nLaura with a passion for De Courcy; and in terms not eminently delicate,\nreproached her with facility in transferring her regards. While the\ncharge was privately made, it appeared to Laura too groundless to affect\nher temper. But Lady Pelham, whose whole life might be said to form one\ngrand experiment upon the powers of provocation, took occasion to rally\nher upon it before some of her companions; hinting not obscurely at the\nsecret which Laura had so religiously kept, and confessed with so much\npain. The attempt was partly successful, for Laura was really angry; but\nshe commanded herself so far as to parry the attack, secretly vowing\nthat her candour should never again commit her to the discretion of Lady\nPelham.\n\nSometimes assuming the tone of a tender monitress, Lady Pelham would\naffect to be seriously convinced that her niece entertained a passion\nfor De Courcy, and treating all Laura's denials as the effect of maiden\ntimidity, would pretend to sympathize in her sufferings, advising her to\nuse her strength of mind to conquer this unfortunate partiality; to\ntransfer her affections from one to whom they appeared valueless to him\nwho sued for them with such interesting perseverance. Above all, she\nentreated her to avoid the appearance of making advances to a man who\nprobably never bestowed a thought on her in return; thus intimating that\nLaura's behaviour might bear so provoking a construction. Laura,\nsometimes irritated, oftener amused by these impertinences, could have\nendured them with tolerable patience; but they were mere interludes to\nLady Pelham's indefatigable chidings on the subject of Hargrave. These\nwere continued with a zeal and industry worthy of better success. And\nyet they could not be said to be wholly unsuccessful, while, though they\ncould not persuade, they could torment. In vain did Laura recount the\nreasons which, even amidst the utmost strength of inclination, would\nhave deterred her from a connection with a person of Hargrave's\ncharacter. To reason with Lady Pelham was a labour at once severe and\nunavailing. She was so dexterous in the use of indefinite language, so\npractised in every art of shift and evasion, that the strongest argument\nfailed to conquer; or if forced from her ground, she on the next\noccasion occupied it again, just as if she had always maintained it\nundisputed. Remonstrance and entreaty were not more successful. In\ndefiance of both, Lady Pelham continued to ring endless changes on the\nsame endless theme, till Laura's patience would have failed her, had she\nnot been consoled by reflecting that the time now drew near when the\npayment of her annuity would enable her to escape from her unwearied\npersecutors. She heartily wished, however, that a change of system might\nmake her residence with Lady Pelham endurable; for strong as was her\nattachment to Mrs Douglas, it was no longer her only friendship; and she\ncould not without pain think of quitting, perhaps for ever, her valued\nfriends at Norwood.\n\nWinter advanced; Lady Pelham began to talk of her removal to town; and\nLaura was not without hopes, that when removed to a distance from\nHargrave, her aunt would remit somewhat of her diligence in his cause.\nLaura expected that his duty would generally confine him to\nhead-quarters, and she hoped to find in his absence a respite from one\nhalf of her plague. At all events, from London she thought she could\neasily procure an escort to Scotland, and she was determined rather\nfinally to forfeit the protection of Lady Pelham, than submit to such\nannoyance as she had of late endured. Laura could not help wondering\nsometimes that her aunt, while she appeared so anxious to promote the\nsuccess of Hargrave, should meditate a step which would place him at a\ndistance from the object of his pursuit; but Lady Pelham's conduct was\nso generally inconsistent, that Laura was weary of trying to reconcile\nits contradictories. She endeavoured to hope that Lady Pelham, at last\nbecoming sensible of the inefficacy of her efforts, was herself growing\ndesirous to escape the Colonel's importunity; and she thought she could\nobserve, that as the time of their departure approached, her Ladyship\nrelaxed somewhat of her industry in teazing.\n\nBut the motives of Lady Pelham's removal did not at all coincide with\nher niece's hopes; and nothing could be further from her intention, than\nto resign her labours in a field so rich in controversy and provocation.\nShe imagined that Laura's obstinacy was occasioned, or at least\nstrengthened by the influence of the De Courcys, and she expected that a\nmore general acquaintance with the world would remove her prejudices. At\nWalbourne, Laura, if offended, could always take refuge with Mrs De\nCourcy. In London, she would be more defenceless. At Walbourne, Lady\nPelham acted under restraint, for there were few objects to divide with\nher the observation of her neighbours, and she felt herself accountable\nto them for the propriety of her conduct; but she would be more at\nliberty in a place where, each immersed in his own business or pleasure,\nno one had leisure to comment on the concerns of others. She knew that\nHargrave would find means to escape the duty of remaining with his\nregiment, and indeed had concerted with him the whole plan of her\noperations.\n\nMeanwhile Laura, altogether unsuspicious of their designs, gladly\nprepared for her journey, considering it as a fortunate instance of the\ninstability of Lady Pelham's purposes. She paid a parting visit to Mrs\nBolingbroke, whom she found established in quiet possession of all the\ngoods of fortune. By the aid of Mrs De Courcy's carriage, she contrived,\nwithout molestation from Hargrave, to spend much of her time at Norwood,\nwhere she was always received with a kindness the most flattering, and\nloaded with testimonies of regard. De Courcy still kept his secret; and\nLaura's suspicions rather diminished when she considered that, though he\nknew she was to go without any certainty of returning, he suffered\nnumberless opportunities to pass without breathing a syllable of love.\n\nThe day preceding that which was fixed for the journey arrived; and\nLaura begged Lady Pelham's permission to spend it entirely with Mrs De\nCourcy. Lady Pelham was rather unwilling to consent, for she remembered\nthat her last excursion had been rendered abortive by a visit to\nNorwood; but, flattering herself that her present scheme was secure from\nhazard of failure, she assumed an accommodating humour, and not only\npermitted Laura to go but allowed the carriage to convey her,\nstipulating that she should return it immediately, and walk home in the\nevening. She found the De Courcys alone, and passed the day less\ncheerfully than any she had ever spent at Norwood. Mrs De Courcy, though\nkind, was grave and thoughtful; Montague absent, and melancholy.\nHarriet's never-failing spirits no longer enlivened the party, and her\nplace was but feebly supplied by the infantine gaiety of De Courcy's\nlittle proteg\u00c3\u00a9 Henry. This child, who was the toy of all his patron's\nleisure hours, had, during her visits to Norwood, become particularly\ninteresting to Laura. His quickness, his uncommon beauty, his engaging\nfrankness, above all, the innocent fondness which he shewed for her, had\nreally attached her to him, and he repaid her with all the affections of\nhis little heart. He would quit his toys to hang upon her; and, though\nat other times, as restless as any of his kind, was never weary of\nsitting quietly on her knee, clasping her snowy neck in his little\nsun-burnt arms. His prattle agreeably interrupted the taciturnity into\nwhich the little party were falling, till his grandfather came to take\nhim away. 'Kiss your hand Henry, and bid Miss Montreville farewell,'\nsaid the old man as he was about to take him from Laura's arms. 'It will\nbe a long time before you see her again.' 'Are you going away?' said the\nchild, looking sorrowfully in Laura's face. 'Yes, far away,' answered\nLaura. 'Then Henry will go with you, Henry's dear pretty lady.' 'No no,'\nsaid his grandfather. 'You must go to your mammy; good boys love their\nmammies best.' 'Then you ought to be Henry's mammy,' cried the child,\nsobbing, and locking his arms round Laura's neck, 'for Henry loves you\nbest.' 'My dear boy!' cried Laura, kissing him with a smile that\nhalf-consented to his wish; but, happening to turn her eye towards De\nCourcy, she saw him change colour, and, with an abruptness unlike his\nusual manner, he snatched the boy from her arms, and, regardless of his\ncries, dismissed him from the room.\n\nThis little incident did not contribute to the cheerfulness of the\ngroup. Grieved to part with her favourite, and puzzled to account for De\nCourcy's behaviour, Laura was now the most silent of the trio. She saw\nnothing in the childish expression of fondness which should have moved\nDe Courcy; yet it had evidently stung him with sudden uneasiness. She\nnow recollected that she had more than once inquired who were the\nparents of this child, and that the question had always been evaded. A\nmotive of curiosity prompted her now to repeat her inquiry, and she\naddressed it to Mrs De Courcy. With a slight shade of embarrassment Mrs\nDe Courcy answered, 'His mother was the only child of our old servant; a\npretty, meek-spirited, unfortunate girl; and his father'--'His father's\ncrimes,' interrupted De Courcy, hastily, 'have brought their own\npunishment; a punishment beyond mortal fortitude to bear;'--and,\ncatching up a book, he asked Laura whether she had seen it, endeavouring\nto divert her attention by pointing out some passages to her notice.\nLaura's curiosity was increased by this appearance of concealment, but\nshe had no means of gratifying it, and the subject vanished from her\nmind when she thought of bidding farewell to her beloved friends,\nperhaps for ever.\n\nWhen she was about to go, Mrs De Courcy affectionately embraced her. 'My\ndear child,' said she, 'second in my love and esteem only to my own\nMontague, almost the warmest wish of my heart is to retain you always\nwith me; but, if that is impossible, short may your absence be, and may\nyou return to us as joyfully as we shall receive you.' Weeping, and\nreluctant to part, Laura at last tore herself away. Hargrave had so\noften stolen upon her walks that the fear of meeting him was become\nhabitual to her, and she wished to escape him by reaching home before\nher return could be expected. As she leant on De Courcy's arms, ashamed\nof being unable to suppress her sensibility, she averted her head, and\nlooked sadly back upon a dwelling endeared to her by many an innocent,\nmany a rational pleasure.\n\nAbsorbed in her regrets, Laura had proceeded a considerable way before\nshe observed that she held a trembling arm; and recollected that De\nCourcy had scarcely spoken since their walk began. Her tears ceased\nsuddenly, while confused and disquieted, she quickened her pace. Soon\nrecollecting herself, she stopped; and thanking him for his escort,\nbegged that he would go no further. 'I cannot leave you yet,' said De\nCourcy in a voice of restrained emotion, and again he led her onwards. A\nfew short sentences were all that passed till they had almost reached\nthe antique gate which terminated the winding part of the avenue. Here\nLaura again endeavoured to prevail upon her companion to return, but\nwithout success. With more composure than before, he refused to leave\nher. Dreading to encounter Hargrave while De Courcy was in such evident\nagitation, she besought him to go, telling him that it was her\nparticular wish that he should proceed no farther. He instantly stopped,\nand, clasping her hand between his, 'Must I then leave you, Laura,' said\nhe; 'you whose presence has so long been the charm of my existence!' The\nblood rushed violently into Laura's face, and as suddenly retired. 'And\ncan I,' continued De Courcy, 'can I suffer you to go without pouring out\nmy full heart to you?' Laura breathed painfully, and she pressed her\nhand upon her bosom to restrain its swelling. 'To talk to you of\npassion,' resumed De Courcy, 'is nothing. You have twined yourself with\nevery wish and every employment, every motive, every hope, till to part\nwith you is tearing my heart-strings.' Again he paused. Laura felt that\nshe was expected to reply, and, though trembling and breathless, made an\neffort to speak. 'This is what I feared,' said she, 'and yet I wish you\nhad been less explicit, for there is no human being whose friendship is\nso dear to me as yours; and now I fear I ought'--The sob which had been\nstruggling in her breast now choked her utterance, and she wept aloud.\n'It is the will of heaven,' said she, 'that I should be reft of every\nearthly friend.' She covered her face and stood labouring to compose\nherself; while, heart-struck with a disappointment which was not\nmitigated by all the gentleness with which it was conveyed, De Courcy\nwas unable to break the silence.\n\n'Ungrateful! selfish that I am,' exclaimed Laura suddenly dashing the\ntears from her eyes, 'thus to think only of my own loss, while I am\ngiving pain to the worthiest of hearts.--My best friend, I cannot indeed\nreturn the regard with which you honour me, but I can make you cease to\nwish that I should. And I deserve the shame and anguish I shall suffer.\nShe, whom you honour with your love,' continued she, the burning crimson\nglowing in her face and neck, 'has been the sport of a passion, strong\nas disgraceful--disgraceful as its object is worthless.'\n\nHer look, her voice, her manner conveyed to De Courcy the strongest idea\nof the torture which this confession cost her; and no sufferings of his\nown could make him insensible to those of Laura. 'Cease, cease,' he\ncried, 'best and dearest of women, do not add to my wretchedness the\nthought of giving pain to you.' Then, after a few moments pause, he\ncontinued, 'it would be wronging your noble candour to doubt that you\nhave recalled your affections.' 'In doing so,' answered Laura, 'I can\nclaim no merit. Infatuation itself could have been blind no longer.'\n'Then why, dearest Laura,' cried De Courcy, his heart again bounding\nwith hope, 'why may not time and the fond assiduities of love'--'Ah!'\ninterrupted Laura, 'that is impossible. A mere preference I might give\nyou, but I need not tell you that I have no more to give.' 'My heavenly\nLaura,' cried De Courcy, eager joy beaming in his eyes, 'give me but\nthis preference, and I would not exchange it for the fondest passion of\nwoman-kind.' 'You deceive yourself,' said Laura mournfully, 'miserably\ndeceive yourself. Such a sentiment could never content you. You would\nmiss a thousand little arts of happiness which love alone can teach;\nobserve a thousand nameless coldnesses which no caution could conceal;\nand you would be unhappy without knowing perhaps of what to complain.\nYou, who would deserve the warmest affection to be content with mere\nendurance! Oh no, I should be wretched in the bare thought of offering\nyou so poor a return.'\n\n'Endurance, Laura! I should indeed be a monster to find joy in any thing\nwhich you could describe by such a word. But must I despair of awakening\nsuch affection as will make duty delightful, such as will enjoy the\nbliss which it bestows?'\n\n'Believe me, my dear friend,' said Laura in a voice as sweet, as\nsoothing, as ever conveyed the tenderest confession, 'believe me I am\nnot insensible to the value of your regard. It adds a new debt of\ngratitude to all that Montreville's daughter owes you. My highest esteem\nshall ever be yours, but after what I have confided to you, a moment's\nconsideration must convince you that all beyond is impossible.' 'Ah!'\nthought De Courcy, 'what will it cost me to believe that it is indeed\nimpossible.' But Laura's avowal was not quite so fatal to his hopes as\nshe imagined; and while she supposed that he was summoning fortitude to\nendure their final destruction, he stood silently pondering Mrs De\nCourcy's oft repeated counsel to let love borrow the garb of friendship,\nnor suffer him undisguised to approach the heart where, having once been\ndethroned as an usurper, all was in arms against him.\n\n'If I must indeed renounce every dearer hope,' resumed he, 'then in your\nfriendship, my ever dear Miss Montreville, I must seek the happiness of\nmy after-life, and surely'--'Oh no,' interrupted Laura, 'that must not\nbe--the part, the little part of your happiness which will depend upon\nearthly connections, you must find in that of some fortunate woman who\nhas yet a heart to give.' 'How can you name it to me?' cried De Courcy\nhalf indignantly! 'Can he who has known you Laura, admired in you all\nthat is noble, loved in you all that is enchanting, transfer his heart\nto some common-place being?--You are my business--you are my pleasure--I\ntoil but to be worthy of you--your approbation is my sweetest\nreward--all earthly things are precious to me but as you share in\nthem--even a better world borrows hope from you. And is this a love to\nbe bestowed on some soulless thing? No, Laura, I cannot, I will not\nchange. If I cannot win your love, I will admit no substitute but your\nfriendship.'\n\n'Indeed, Mr De Courcy,' cried Laura, unconsciously pressing, in the\nenergy of speech, the hand which held hers. 'Indeed it is to no\ncommon-place woman that I wish to resign you. Lonely as my own life must\nbe, its chief pleasures must arise from the happiness of my friends, and\nto know that you are happy.'--Laura stopped, for she felt her own voice\ngrow tremulous. 'But we will not talk of this now,' resumed she, 'I\nshall be absent for some months at least, and in that time you will\nbring yourself to think differently. Promise me at least to make the\nattempt.'\n\n'No, Laura,' answered De Courcy, 'that I cannot promise. I will never\nharass you with importunity or complaint, but the love of you shall be\nmy heart's treasure, it shall last though life--beyond life--and if you\ncannot love me, give in return only such kind thoughts as you would\nbestow on one who would promote your happiness at the expence of his\nown. And promise me, dearest Laura, that when we meet, you will not\nreceive me with suspicion or reserve, as if you feared that I should\npresume on your favour, or persecute you with solicitations. Trust to my\nhonour, trust to my love itself for sparing you all unavailing entreaty.\nPromise me then, ever to consider me as a friend, a faithful tender\nfriend; and forget, till my weakness reminds you of it, that ever you\nknew me as a lover.'\n\n'Ah, Mr De Courcy,' cried Laura, tears filling her eyes, 'what thoughts\nbut the kindest can I ever have of him who comforted my father's\nsorrows, who relieved--in a manner that made relief indeed a\nkindness--relieved my father's wants? And what suspicion, what coldness\ncan I ever feel towards him whom my father loved and honoured! Yes I\nwill trust you; for I know that you are as far above owing favours to\ncompassion as to fear.'\n\n'A thousand thanks, beloved Laura,' cried De Courcy, kissing her hands,\n'and thus I seal our compact. One thing more; shall I trespass on your\nnoble frankness, if I ask you whether, had not another stolen the\nblessing, I might have hoped to awaken a warmer regard? whether any\nlabour, any cares could have won for me what he has forfeited?'\n\nSilent and blushing, Laura stood for a few moments with her eyes fixed\non the ground, then raising them, said, 'From you I fear no wrong\nconstruction of my words, and will frankly own to you that for my own\nsake, as well as yours, I wish you had been known to me ere the serpent\nwound me in his poisoned folds. I believe, indeed, that no mortal but\nhimself could have inspired the same--what shall I call an infatuation\nwith which reason had nothing to do. But you have the virtues which I\nhave been taught to love, and--and--But what avails it now? I _was_\nindeed a social creature; domestic habits, domestic wishes strong in me.\nBut what avails it now!'\n\n'And was there a time when you could have loved me, Laura? Blessings on\nyou for the concession. It shall cheer my exiled heart when you are far\ndistant; sooth me with delightful day-dreams of what might have been;\nand give my solitude a charm which none but you could bring to the most\nsocial hour.'\n\n'Your solitude, my honoured friend,' replied Laura, 'needs it not; it\nhas better and nobler charms; the charms of usefulness, of piety; and\nlong may these form your business and delight. But what makes me linger\nwith you. I meant to have hastened home that I might avoid one as unlike\nto you as confidence is to fear; the feelings which you each\ninspire--Farewell. I trust I shall soon hear that you are well and\nhappy.'\n\nLoath to part, De Courcy endeavoured to detain her while he again gave\nutterance to his strong affection; and when she would be gone, bade her\nfarewell in language so solemn, so tender, that all her self-command\ncould not repress the tears which trickled down her cheeks. They parted;\nhe followed her to beg that she would think of him sometimes. Again she\nleft him; again he had some little boon to crave. She reached the gate,\nand looking back saw De Courcy standing motionless where she had last\nquitted him. She beckoned a farewell. The gate closed after her, and De\nCourcy felt as if one blank dreary waste had blotted the fair face of\nnature.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nThe evening was closing, when Laura proceeded on her way. She had\noutstaid her purposed time, and from every bush by the path side she\nexpected to see Hargrave steal upon her; in every gust of the chill\nNovember wind she thought she heard his footstep. She passed the last\ncottages connected with Norwood. The evening fires glanced cheerfully\nthrough the casements, and the voice of rustic merriment came softened\non the ear. 'Amiable De Courcy!' thought Laura. 'The meanest of his\ndependents finds comfort in his protection, while the being on whom I\nhave lavished the affection which might have rejoiced that worthy heart,\nmakes himself an object of dread, even to her whom he pretends to love.'\nShe reached home, however, without interruption, and was going to join\nLady Pelham in the sitting-room; when happening to pass a looking-glass,\nshe observed that her eyes still bore traces of the tears she had been\nshedding, and, in dread of the merciless raillery of her aunt, she\nretired to her own room. There, with an undefined feeling of\ndespondence, she sat down to re-consider her conversation with De\nCourcy.\n\nNever was task more easy, or more unprofitable. She remembered every\nword that De Courcy had uttered; remembered the very tone, look, and\ngesture with which they were spoken. She recollected too all that she\nhad said in reply; but she could by no means unravel the confused\neffects of the scene upon her own mind. She certainly pitied her lover\nto a very painful degree. 'Poor De Courcy!' said she, accompanying the\nhalf-whisper with a heavy sigh. But having, in the course of half an\nhour's rumination, repeated this soliloquy about twenty times, she began\nto recollect that De Courcy had borne his disappointment with\nconsiderable philosophy, and appeared to derive no small comfort from\nthe prospect of an intercourse of mere friendship. This fortunate\nrecollection, however, not immediately relieving her, she endeavoured to\naccount for her depression by laying hold of a vague idea which was\nfloating in her mind, that she had not on this occasion acted as she\nought. Friendships between young persons of different sexes were\nproverbial fomenters of the tender passion; and though she was herself\nin perfect safety, was it right to expose to such hazard the peace of De\nCourcy? Was it generous, was it even honourable to increase the\ndifficulties of his self-conquest, by admitting him to the intimacy of\nfriendship? It was true he had voluntarily sought the post of danger:\nbut then he was under the dominion of an influence which did not allow\nhim to weigh consequences; and was it not unpardonable in her, who was\nin full possession of herself, to sanction, to aid his imprudence? Yet\nhow could she have rejected a friendship which did her so much honour?\nthe friendship of the man whom her father had so loved and respected! of\nthe man to whom her father had wished to see her connected by the\nclosest ties! the man to whom she owed obligations never to be repaid?\nAlas! how had she acknowledged these obligations? By suffering the most\namiable of mankind to sport with his affections, while she had weakly\nthrown away her own. But the mischief was not yet totally irremediable;\nand dazzled by the romantic generosity of sacrificing her highest\nearthly joy to the restoration of her benefactor's quiet, she snatched a\npen intending to retract her promise. An obsolete notion of decorum was\nfor once favourable to a lover, and Laura saw the impropriety of writing\nto De Courcy. Besides, it occurred to her that she might withdraw into\nScotland, without formally announcing the reason of her retreat; and\nthus leave herself at liberty to receive De Courcy as a friend whenever\ndiscretion should warrant this indulgence. After her most magnanimous\nresolves however, feeling her mind as confused and comfortless as\nbefore, she determined to obtain the benefit of impartial counsel, and\nchanged the destination of the paper on which she had already written\n'My dear friend,' from De Courcy to Mrs Douglas.\n\nWith all her native candour and singleness of heart did Laura detail her\ncase to the monitress of her youth. To reveal De Courcy's name was\ncontrary to her principles; but she described his situation, his mode of\nlife, and domestic habits. She enlarged upon his character, her\nobligations to him, and the regret which, for his sake, she felt, that\nparticular circumstances rendered her incapable of such an attachment as\nwas necessary to conjugal happiness. She mentioned her compliance with\nher lover's request of a continuance of their former intimacy; confessed\nher doubts of the propriety of her concession; and entreated Mrs\nDouglas's explicit opinion on the past, as well as her directions for\nthe future.\n\nHer mind thus unburdened, she was less perplexed and uneasy; and the\nnext morning cheerfully commenced her journey, pleasing herself with the\nprospect of being released from the harassing attendance of Hargrave. On\nthe evening of the second day the travellers reached Grosvenor Street;\nand the unsuspecting Laura, with renewed sentiments of gratitude to her\naunt, revisited the dwelling which had received her when she could claim\nno other shelter.\n\nHer annuity having now become due, Laura, soon after her arrival in\ntown, one day borrowed Lady Pelham's chariot, that she might go to\nreceive the money, and purchase some necessary additions to her\nwardrobe. Remembering, however, the inconveniencies to which she had\nbeen subjected by her imprudence in leaving herself without money, she\nregulated her disbursements by the strictest economy; determined to\nreserve a sum, which, besides a little gift to her cousin, might defray\nthe expences of a journey to Scotland.\n\nHer way chancing to lie through Holborn, a recollection of the\ncivilities of her old landlady, induced her to stop and inquire for Mrs\nDawkins. The good woman almost compelled her to alight; overwhelmed her\nwith welcomes, and asked a hundred questions in a breath, giving in\nreturn a very detailed account of all her family affairs. She informed\nLaura, that Miss Julia, having lately read the life of a heroine who in\nthe capacity of a governess captivated the heart of a great lord, had\nbeen seized with the desire to seek adventures under a similar\ncharacter; but finding that recommendations for experience were\nnecessary to her admission into any family of rank, she had condescended\nto serve her apprenticeship in the tuition of the daughters of an\neminent cowfeeder. The good woman expressed great compassion for the\npupils of so incompetent a teacher, from whom they could learn nothing\nuseful. 'But that was,' she observed, 'their father's look out, and in\nthe mean time, it was so far well that July was doing something towards\nher keeping.' After a visit of some length Laura wished to be gone, but\nher hostess would not suspend her eloquence long enough to suffer her to\ntake leave. She was at last obliged to interrupt the harangue; and\nbreaking from her indefatigable entertainer, hurried home, not a little\nalarmed lest her stay should expose her on her return home to oratory\nof a different kind. Lady Pelham, however, received her most graciously,\nexamined all her purchases, and enquired very particularly into the cost\nof each. She calculated the amount, and the balance of the annuity\nremaining in Laura's possession. 'Five and thirty pounds!' she\nexclaimed--'what in the world, Laura, will you do with so much money?'\n'Perhaps five and thirty different things,' answered Laura, smiling; 'I\nhave never had, nor ever shall have, half so much money as I could\nspend.' 'Oh you extravagant thing!' cried Lady Pelham patting her cheek.\n'But take care that some one does not save you the trouble of spending\nit. You should be very sure of the locks of your drawers. You had better\nlet me put your treasures into my bureau.' Laura was about to comply,\nwhen recollecting that there might be some awkwardness in asking her\naunt for the money while she concealed its intended destination, she\nthanked Lady Pelham, but said she supposed it would be perfectly safe in\nher own custody; and then, as usual, avoided impending altercation by\nhastening out of the room. She thought Lady Pelham looked displeased;\nbut as that was a necessary effect of the slightest contradiction, she\nsaw it without violent concern; and the next time they met, her Ladyship\nwas again all smiles and courtesy.\n\nThree days, 'three wondrous days', all was sunshine and serenity. Lady\nPelham was the most ingenious, the most amusing, the most fascinating of\nwoman-kind. 'What a pity,' thought Laura, 'that my aunt's spirits are so\nfluctuating! How delightful she can be when she pleases!' In the midst\nof these brilliant hours, Lady Pelham one morning ran into the room\nwhere Laura was at work--'Here's a poor fellow,' said she, with a look\nand voice all compassion, 'who has sent me his account, and says he must\ngo to jail if it is not paid instantly. But it is quite impossible for\nme to get the money till tomorrow.' 'To jail!' cried Laura,\nshocked--'What is the amount?' 'Forty pounds,' said Lady Pelham, 'and I\nhave not above ten in the house.' 'Take mine,' cried Laura, hastening to\nbring it. Lady Pelham stopped her. 'No, my dear good girl,' said she, 'I\nwont take away your little store, perhaps you may want it yourself.' 'Oh\nno,' said Laura, 'I cannot want it, pray let me bring it.' 'The poor man\nhas a large family,' said Lady Pelham, 'but indeed I am very unwilling\nto take--' Her Ladyship spared further regrets, for Laura was out of\nhearing. She returned in a moment with the whole of her wealth, out of\nwhich, Lady Pelham, after some further hesitation, was prevailed upon\nto take thirty pounds; a robbery to which she averred that she would\nnever have consented, but for the wretched situation of an innocent\nfamily, and her own certainty of repaying the debt in a day or two at\nfarthest. Several days, however, passed away, and Lady Pelham made no\nmention of discharging her debt. Laura wondered a little that her aunt\nshould forget a promise so lately and so voluntarily given; but her\nattention was entirely diverted from the subject by the following letter\nfrom Mrs Douglas.\n\n     'You see, my dear Laura, I lose no time in answering your\n     letter, though, for the first time, I answer you with some\n     perplexity. The weight which you have always kindly allowed to\n     my opinion, makes me at all times give it with timidity; but\n     that is not the only reason of my present hesitation. I confess\n     that in spite of the apparent frankness and perspicuity with\n     which you have written, I am not able exactly to comprehend\n     you. You describe a man of respectable abilities, of amiable\n     dispositions, of sound principles, and engaging manners. You\n     profess that such qualities, aided by intimacy, have secured\n     your cordial friendship, while obligations beyond return have\n     enlivened this friendship by the warmest gratitude. But, just\n     as I am about to conclude that all this has produced its\n     natural effect, and to prepare my congratulations for a happy\n     occasion, you kill my expectations with a dismal sentence,\n     expressing your regrets for having been obliged to reject the\n     addresses of this excellent person. Now this might have been\n     intelligible enough, supposing you were pre-occupied by a\n     stronger attachment. But so far from this, you declare yourself\n     absolutely incapable of any exclusive affection, or of such a\n     regard as is necessary to any degree of happiness in the\n     conjugal state. I know not, my dear Laura, what ideas you may\n     entertain of the fervency suitable to wedded love; but, had you\n     been less peremptory, I should have thought it not unlikely to\n     spring from a young woman's \"most cordial esteem\" and \"warmest\n     gratitude\" towards a young man with \"expressive black eyes,\"\n     and \"the most benevolent smile in the world.\"\n\n     'From the tenor of your letter, as well as from some\n     expressions you have formerly dropped, I am led to conjecture\n     that you think an extravagant passion necessary to the\n     happiness of married life. You will smile at the expression;\n     but if it offends you, change it for any other descriptive of a\n     feeling beyond tender friendship, and you will find the\n     substitute nearly synonymous with the original. Now this idea\n     appears to me rather erroneous; and I cannot help thinking that\n     calm, dispassionate affection, at least on the side of the\n     lady, promises more permanent comfort.\n\n     'All male writers on the subject of love, so far as my little\n     knowledge extends, represent possession as the infallible cure\n     of passion. A very unattractive picture, it must be confessed,\n     of the love of that lordly sex! but they themselves being the\n     painters, the deformity is a pledge of the resemblance, and I\n     own my small experience furnishes no instance to contradict\n     their testimony. Taking its truth then for granted, I need not\n     inquire whether the passions of our own sex be equally\n     fleeting. If they be, the enamoured pair soon find themselves\n     at best in the same situation with those who marry from sober\n     sentiments of regard; that is, obliged to seek happiness in the\n     esteem, the confidence, the forbearance of each other. But if,\n     in the female breast, the fervours of passion be less\n     transient, I need not describe to you the sufferings of\n     feminine sensibility under half-returned ardour, nor the stings\n     of feminine pride under the unnatural and mortifying\n     transference of the arts of courtship. I trust, my dear child,\n     that should you even make a marriage of passion, your\n     self-command will enable you to smother its last embers in your\n     own bosom, while your prudence will improve the short advantage\n     which is conferred by its empire in that of your husband, to\n     lay the foundation of an affection more tender than friendship,\n     more lasting than love.\n\n     'Again, it is surely of the utmost consequence to the felicity\n     of wedded life, that a just and temperate estimate be formed of\n     the character of him to whose temper we must accommodate\n     ourselves; whose caprices we must endure; whose failings we\n     must pardon, whether the discord burst upon us in thunder, or\n     steal on amid harmonies which render it imperceptible, perhaps\n     half-pleasing. Small chance is there that passion should view\n     with the calm extenuating eye of reason the faults which it\n     suddenly detects in the god of its idolatry. The once fervent\n     votary of the idol, finding it unworthy of his worship,\n     neglects the useful purposes to which he might apply the gold\n     which it contains.\n\n     'I have other reasons for thinking that passion is at best\n     unnecessary to conjugal happiness; but even if I should make\n     you a proselyte to my opinion, the conviction would, in the\n     present case, probably come too late. Such a man as you\n     describe will probably be satisfied with the answer he has\n     received. He will certainly never importune you, nor poorly\n     attempt to extort from your pity what he could not win from\n     your love. His attachment will soon subside into a friendly\n     regard for you, or be diverted into another channel by virtues\n     similar to those which first attracted him. I only wish, my\n     dear Laura, that after this change takes place, the\n     \"circumstances\" may remain in force which render you \"for ever\n     incapable of repaying him with a love like his own.\" If you are\n     sure that these circumstances are decisive, I foresee no evil\n     which can result from your cultivating a friendship so\n     honourable and advantageous to you, as that of a man of letters\n     and a Christian; whose conversation may improve your mind, and\n     whose experience may supply that knowledge of the world which\n     is rarely attainable by women in the more private walks of\n     life.\n\n     'To him I should suppose that no danger could arise from such\n     an intercourse. We are all apt to over-rate the strength and\n     durability of the attachments we excite. I believe the truth\n     is, that in a vigorous, well-governed, and actively employed\n     mind, love rarely becomes that resistless tyrant which vanity\n     and romances represent him. His empire is divided by the love\n     of fame or the desire of usefulness, the eagerness of research\n     or the triumph of discovery. But even solitude, idleness, and\n     imagination cannot long support his dominion without the\n     assistance of hope; and I take it for granted from your tried\n     honour and generosity, that your answer has been too explicit\n     to leave your lover in any doubt that your sentence is final.\n\n     'I own I could have wished, that the virtues of my ever dear\n     Laura had found in the sacred characters of wife and mother a\n     larger field than a state of celibacy can afford; but I have no\n     fear that your happiness or respectability should ever depend\n     upon outward circumstances. I have no doubt that moderate\n     wishes and useful employments will diffuse cheerfulness in the\n     loneliest dwelling, while piety will people it with guests from\n     heaven.\n\n     'Thus, my beloved child, I have given my opinion with all the\n     freedom you can desire. I have written a volume rather than a\n     letter. The passion for giving advice long survives that which\n     is the subject of our correspondence; but to shew you that I\n     can lay some restraint on an old woman's rage for admonition, I\n     will not add another line except that which assures you that I\n     am, with all a mother's love, and all a friend's esteem,\n\n                   'Your affectionate\n                                     'E. DOUGLAS.'\n\nLaura read this letter often, and pondered it deeply. Though she could\nnot deny that it contained some truths, she was not satisfied with the\ndoctrine deduced from them. She remembered that Mrs Douglas was the most\naffectionate of wives; and concluded that in one solitary instance her\njudgment had been at variance with her practice; and that, having\nherself made a marriage of love, she was not an adequate judge of the\ndisadvantages attending a more dispassionate connection. Some passages\ntoo she could well have spared; but as these were prophetic rather than\nmonitory, they required little consideration; and after the second\nreading, Laura generally omitted them in the perusal of her friend's\nepistle. Upon the whole, however, it gave her pleasure. Her conscience\nwas relieved by obtaining the sanction of Mrs Douglas to her promised\nintimacy with De Courcy, and already she looked forward to the time when\nit should be renewed.\n\nSince her arrival in town, her aunt, all kindness and complacency, had\nscarcely named Hargrave; and, with the sanguine temper of youth, Laura\nhoped that she had at last exhausted the perseverance of her\npersecutors. This fruitful source of strife removed, she thought she\ncould without much difficulty submit to the casual fits of caprice to\nwhich Lady Pelham was subject; and considering that her aunt, with all\nher faults, was still her most natural protector, and her house her most\nproper abode, she began to lay aside thoughts of removing immediately to\nScotland, and to look towards Walbourne as her permanent home.\n\nIn the meantime she promised herself that the approaching winter would\nbring her both amusement and information. The capital, with all its\nwonders, of which she had hitherto seen little, the endless diversity of\ncharacter which she expected its inhabitants to exhibit, the\nconversation of the literary and the elegant, of wits, senators, and\nstatesmen, promised an inexhaustible fund of instruction and delight.\nNay, the patriotic heart of Laura beat high with the hope of meeting\nsome of those heroes who, undaunted by disaster, where all but honour is\nlost maintain the honour of Britain, or who, with happier fortune, guide\nthe triumphant navies of our native land. She was yet to learn how\nlittle of character appears through the varnish of fashionable manners,\nand how little a hero or a statesman at a rout differs from a mere man\nof fashion in the same situation.\n\nLady Pelham seemed inclined to furnish her with all the opportunities\nof observation which she could desire, introducing her to every visitor\nof distinction, and procuring for her the particular attention of two\nladies of high rank, who constantly invited her to share in the gaieties\nof the season. But Laura, instructed in the value of time, and feeling\nherself accountable for its employment, stopped far short of the\ndissipation of her companions. She had long since established a\ncriterion by which to judge of the innocence of her pleasure, accounting\nevery amusement, from which she returned to her duties with an exhausted\nframe, languid spirits, or distracted attention, to be at best\ndangerous, and contrary to all rational ends of recreation. Of\nentertainments which she had never before witnessed, curiosity generally\ninduced her for once to partake; but she found few that could stand her\ntest; and to those which failed in the trial, she returned as seldom as\npossible.\n\nOne species alone, if it deserves to be classed with entertainments, she\nwas unwillingly obliged to except from her rule. From card-parties Laura\nalways returned fatigued both in mind and body; while present at them\nshe had scarcely any other wish than to escape; and she quitted them\nunfit for any thing but rest. Lady Pelham, however, sometimes made it a\npoint that her niece should accompany her to these parties; and, though\nshe never asked Laura to play, was occasionally at pains to interest her\nin the game, by calling her to her side, appealing to her against\nill-fortune, or exacting her congratulations in success. A few of these\nparties excepted, Laura's time passed pleasantly. Though the calm of her\naunt's temper was now and then disturbed by short gusts of anger, it\nreturned as lightly as it fled; and the subject, fertile in endless\nchiding, seemed almost forgotten.\n\nA fortnight had passed in this sort of quiet, when one morning Lady\nPelham proposed to carry Laura to see the Marquis of --'s superb\ncollection of pictures. Laura, obliged by her aunt's attention to her\nprevailing taste, eagerly accepted the proposal, and hastened to equip\nherself for the excursion. Light of heart, she was returning to the\ndrawing-room to wait till the carriage drew up, when, on entering, the\nfirst object she beheld was Colonel Hargrave, seated confidentially by\nthe side of Lady Pelham.\n\nLaura, turning sick with vexation, shrunk back; and, bewailing the\ndeparture of her short-lived quiet, returned, half angry, half\nsorrowful, to her own room. She had little time, however, to indulge her\nchagrin, for Lady Pelham almost immediately sent to her to let her know\nthat the carriage waited. Disconcerted, and almost out of humour, Laura\nhad tossed aside her bonnet, and was about to retract her consent to go,\nwhen, recollecting that the plan had been proposed on her account,\nwithout any apparent motive unless to oblige her, she thought her aunt\nwould have just reason to complain of such an ungracious rejection of\nher civility.\n\n'Besides, it is like a spoiled child,' thought she, 'to quarrel with any\namusement, because one disagreeable circumstance attends it;' and,\nreadjusting her bonnet, she joined Lady Pelham, not without a secret\nhope that Hargrave might not be of the party. The hope deceived her. He\nwas ready to hand her into the carriage, and to take his seat by her\nside.\n\nHer sanguine expectations thus put to flight, the habitual complacency\nof Laura's countenance suffered a sudden eclipse. She answered almost\npeevishly to Hargrave's inquiries for her health; and so complete was\nher vexation, that it was long ere she observed how much his manner\ntowards her was changed. He whispered no extravagancies in her ear;\noffered her no officious attentions; and seized no opportunities of\naddressing her, but such as were consistent with politeness and respect.\nHe divided his assiduities not unequally between her and Lady Pelham;\nand even without any apparent reluctance, permitted a genteel young man,\nto whom the ladies curtsied in passing, to share in his office of\nescort, and almost to monopolize Laura's conversation. Having\naccompanied the ladies home, he left them immediately, refusing Lady\nPelham's invitation to dinner; and Laura, no less pleased than surprised\nat this unexpected turn, wished him good morning more graciously than\nshe had of late spoken to him.\n\nThe next day he dined in Grosvenor Street, and the same propriety of\nmanner continued. The following evening Laura again met with him in a\nlarge party. He did not distinguish her particularly from any of her\nfair competitors. Laura was delighted. She was convinced that he had at\nlast resolved to abandon his fruitless pursuit; but what had so suddenly\nwrought this happy change, she could not divine.\n\nHe did not visit Lady Pelham daily, yet it so happened that Laura saw\nhim every day, and still he was consistent. Laura scarcely doubted, yet\ndurst scarcely trust her good fortune.\n\nThe violent passions of Hargrave, however, in some degree unfitted him\nfor a deceiver; and sometimes the fiery glance of impatience, of\nadmiration, or of jealousy, belied the serenity of his manner. Laura\ndid not fail to remark this; but she possessed the happy faculty of\nexplaining every ambiguity in human conduct, in a way favourable to the\nactor,--a faculty which, though it sometimes exposed her to mistake and\nvexation, was, upon the whole, at once a happiness and a virtue. She\nconcluded that Hargrave, determined to persecute her no further, was\nstriving to overcome his passion; that the appearances she had remarked\nwere only the struggles which he could not wholly suppress; and she felt\nherself grateful to him for making the attempt,--the more grateful from\nher idea of its difficulty.\n\nWith her natural singleness of heart, she one day mentioned to Lady\nPelham the change in Hargrave's behaviour. 'I suppose,' added she\nsmiling, 'that, finding he can make nothing more of me, he is resolved\nto lay me under obligation by leaving me at peace, having first\ncontrived to make me sensible of its full value.' Lady Pelham was a\nbetter dissembler than Colonel Hargrave; and scarcely did a change of\ncolour announce the deception, while, in a tone of assumed anger, she\nanswered by reproaching her niece with having at last accomplished her\npurpose, and driven her lover to despair. Yet Lady Pelham was aware that\nHargrave had not a thought of relinquishing his pursuit. His new-found\nself-command was merely intended to throw Laura off her guard, that Lady\nPelham might have an opportunity of executing a scheme which Lambert had\nconceived, to entangle Laura beyond the possibility of escape.\n\nMany an action, harmless in itself, is seen, by a discerning bystander,\nto have in it 'nature that in time will venom breed, though no teeth for\nthe present.' It happened that Lambert, while at Walbourne, had once\nseen Laura engaged in a party at chess; and her bent brow and flushed\ncheek, her palpitating bosom, her trembling hand, her eagerness for\nvictory, above all, her pleasure in success, restrained but not\nconcealed, inspired him with an idea that play might be made subservient\nto the designs of his friend; designs which he was the more disposed to\npromote, because, for the present, they occupied Hargrave to the\nexclusion of that folly of which Lambert had so well availed himself.\n\nIt was Lambert's proposal that he should himself engage Laura in play;\nand having won from her, by means which he could always command, that he\nshould transfer the debt to Hargrave. The scheme was seconded by Lady\nPelham, and, in part, acquiesced in by Hargrave. But though he could\nconsent to degrade the woman whom he intended for his wife, he could\nnot endure that any other than himself should be the instrument of her\ndegradation; and, sickening at the shackles which the love of gaming had\nimposed upon himself, he positively refused to accede to that part of\nthe plan, which proposed to make Laura's entanglement with him the\nbranch of a habit previously formed. Besides, the formation of a habit,\nespecially one so contrary to previous bias, was a work of time; and a\nstrategem of tedious execution did not suit the impatience of Hargrave's\ntemper. He consented, however, to adopt a more summary modification of\nthe same artifice. It was intended that Laura should at first be induced\nto play for a stake too small to alarm her, yet sufficiently great to\nmake success desirable; that she should at first be allowed to win; that\nthe stake should be increased until she should lose a sum which it might\nincommode her to part with; and then that the stale cheat of gamblers,\nhope of retrieving her loss, should be pressed on her as a motive for\nventuring nearer to destruction.\n\nThe chief obstacle to the execution of this honourable enterprise lay in\nthe first step, the difficulty of persuading Laura to play for any sum\nwhich could be at all important to her. For obviating this, Lady Pelham\ntrusted to the diffidence, the extreme timidity, the abhorrence of\nnotoriety, which nature strengthened by education had made a leading\nfeature in the character of Laura. Her Ladyship determined that the\nfirst essay should be made in a large company, in the presence of\npersons of rank, of fame, of talent, of every qualification which could\naugment the awe almost amounting to horror, with which Laura shrunk from\nthe gaze of numbers.\n\nPartly from a craving for a confident, partly in hope of securing\nassistance, Lady Pelham communicated her intention to the honourable Mrs\nClermont, a dashing widow of five-and-thirty. The piercing black eyes,\nthe loud voice, the free manner, and good-humoured assurance of this\nlady, had inspired Laura with a kind of dread, which had not yielded to\nthe advances which the widow condescended to make. Lady Pelham judged it\nmost favourable to her righteous purpose, that the first attempt should\nbe made in the house of Mrs Clermont, rather than in her own; both\nbecause that lady's higher circle of acquaintance could command a more\nimposing assemblage of visitors; and because this arrangement would\nleave her Ladyship more at liberty to watch the success of her scheme,\nthan she could be where she was necessarily occupied as mistress of the\nceremonies.\n\nThe appointed evening came, and Lady Pelham, though with the utmost\nkindness of manner, insisted upon Laura's attendance. Laura would rather\nhave been excused; yet, not to interrupt a humour so harmonious, she\nconsented to go. Lady Pelham was all complacency. She condescended to\npreside at her niece's toilette, and obliged her to complete her dress\nby wearing for that evening a superb diamond aigrette, one of the\nornaments of her own earlier years. Laura strenuously resisted this\naddition to her attire, accounting it wholly unsuitable to her\nsituation; but her aunt would take no denial, and the affair was not\nworthy of a more serious refusal. This important concern adjusted, Lady\nPelham viewed her niece with triumphant admiration. She burst forth into\npraises of her beauty, declaring, that she had never seen her look half\nso lovely. Yet, with skilful malice, she contrived to awaken Laura's\nnatural bashfulness, by saying, as they were alighting at Mrs Clermont's\ndoor, 'Now my dear don't mortify me to-night by any of your Scotch\n_gaucheries_. Remember every eye will be turned upon you.' 'Heaven\nforbid,' thought Laura, and timidly followed her aunt to a couch where\nshe took her seat.\n\nFor a while Lady Pelham's words seemed prophetic, and Laura could not\nraise her eyes without meeting the gaze of admiration or of scrutiny;\nbut the rooms began to be crowded by the great and the gay, and Laura\nwas relieved from her vexatious distinction. Lady Pelham did not long\nsuffer her to enjoy her release, but rising, proposed that they should\nwalk. Though Laura felt in her own majestic stature a very unenviable\nclaim to notice, a claim rendered more conspicuous by the contrast\noffered in the figure of her companion, she could not with politeness\nrefuse to accompany her aunt, and giving Lady Pelham her arm, they began\ntheir round.\n\nLaura, little acquainted with the ease which prevails in town parties,\ncould not help wondering at the nonchalance of Mrs Clermont, who,\nleaving her guests to entertain themselves as they chose, was lounging\non a sofa playing piquet with Colonel Hargrave. 'Mrs Clermont at\npiquet,' said Lady Pelham. 'Come Laura, piquet is the only civilized\nkind of game you play. You shall take a lesson;' and she led her niece\nforwards through a circle of misses, who, in hopes of catching the\nattention of the handsome Colonel Hargrave, were tittering and talking\nnonsense most laboriously. This action naturally drew the eyes of all\nupon Laura, and Lady Pelham, who expected to find useful engines in her\ntimidity and embarrassment, did not fail to make her remark the notice\nwhich she excited. From this notice Laura would have escaped, by\nseating herself near Mrs Clermont; but Lady Pelham perceiving her\nintention, placed herself there without ceremony, so as to occupy the\nonly remaining seats, leaving Laura standing alone, shrinking at the\nconsciousness of her conspicuous situation. No one was near her to whom\nshe could address herself, and her only resource was bending down to\noverlook Mrs Clermont's game.\n\nShe had kept her station long enough to be fully sensible of its\nawkwardness, when Mrs Clermont, suddenly starting up, exclaimed, 'Bless\nme! I had quite forgotten that I promised to make a loo-table for the\nDutchess. Do, my dear Miss Montreville, take my hand for half an hour.'\n'Excuse me, Madam,' said Laura, drawing back, 'I play so ill.' 'Nay,\nLaura,' interrupted Lady Pelham, 'your teacher is concerned to maintain\nyour skill, and I insist on it that you play admirably.' 'Had not your\nLadyship better play?' 'Oh no, my dear; I join the loo-table.' 'Come,'\nsaid Mrs Clermont, offering Laura the seat she had just quitted, 'I will\ntake no excuse; so sit down, and success attend you!' The seat presented\nLaura with an inviting opportunity of turning her back upon her\ninspectors, she was averse from refusing such a trifling request, and\nrather willing to give Hargrave a proof that she was not insensible to\nthe late improvement in his behaviour. She therefore quietly took the\nplace assigned her, while the trio exchanged smiles of congratulation on\nthe facility with which she had fallen into the snare.\n\nSomething, however, yet remained to be arranged, and Lady Pelham and her\nhostess still kept their stations by her side. While dividing the cards,\nLaura recollected having observed that, in town, every game seemed\nplayed for money; and she asked her antagonist what was to be the stake.\nHe of course referred that point to her own decision; but Laura, in\nprofound ignorance of the arcana of card-tables, blushed, hesitated, and\nlooked at Lady Pelham and Mrs Clermont for instructions. 'We don't play\nhigh in this house, my dear,' said Mrs Clermont, 'Colonel Hargrave and I\nwere only playing guineas.' 'Laura is only a beginner,' said Lady\nPelham, 'and perhaps half a guinea'--Laura interrupted her aunt by\nrising and deliberately collecting the cards, 'Colonel Hargrave will\nexcuse me,' said she. 'That is far too great a stake for me.' 'Don't be\nabsurd, my dear,' said Lady Pelham, touching Laura's sleeve, and\naffecting to whisper; 'why should not you play as other people do?'\nLaura not thinking this a proper time to explain her conscientious\nscruples, merely answered, that she could not afford it; and, more\nembarrassed than before, would have glided away, but neither of her\nguards would permit her to pass. 'You need not mind what you stake with\nHargrave,' said Lady Pelham apart; 'you play so much better than he that\nyou will infallibly win.' 'That does not at all alter the case,'\nreturned Laura. 'It would be as unpleasant to me to win Colonel\nHargrave's money as to lose my own.' 'Whatever stake Miss Montreville\nchooses must be equally agreeable to me,' said Colonel Hargrave; but\nLaura observed that the smile which accompanied these words had in it\nmore of sarcasm than of complacency. 'I should be sorry, Sir,' said she,\n'that you lowered your play on my account. Perhaps some of these young\nladies,' continued she, looking round to the talkative circle\nbehind--'Be quiet, Laura,' interrupted Lady Pelham, again in an under\ntone; 'you will make yourself the town-talk with your fooleries.' 'I\nhope not,' returned Laura, calmly; 'but if I do, there is no help;\nlittle inconveniencies must be submitted to for the sake of doing\nright.' 'Lord, Miss Montreville,' cried Mrs Clermont aloud, 'what odd\nnotions you have! Who would mind playing for half a guinea. It is\nnothing; absolutely nothing. It would not buy a pocket handkerchief.' It\nwould buy a week's food for a poor family, thought Laura; and she was\nconfirmed in her resolution; but not willing to expose this reason to\nridicule, and a little displeased that Mrs Clermont should take the\nliberty of urging her, she coolly, yet modestly replied, 'That such\nmatters must greatly depend on the opinions and circumstances of the\nparties concerned, of which they were themselves the best judges.' 'I\ninsist on your playing,' said Lady Pelham, in an angry half-whisper. 'If\nyou will make yourself ridiculous, let it be when I am not by to share\nin the ridicule.' 'Excuse me, Madam, for to-night,' returned Laura,\npleadingly. 'Before another evening I will give you reasons which I am\nsure will satisfy you.' 'I am sure,' said Hargrave, darting a very\nsignificant look towards Laura, 'if Miss Montreville, instead of cards,\nprefers allowing me to attend her in your absence, I shall gain\ninfinitely by the exchange.' Laura, to whom his glance made this hint\nvery intelligible, reddened; and, saying she would by no means interrupt\nhis amusement, was again turning to seek a substitute among her\ntittering neighbours, when Mrs Clermont prevented her, by calling out to\na lady at a considerable distance. 'My dear Dutchess, do have the\ngoodness to come hither, and talk to this whimsical beauty of ours. She\nis seized with an economical fit, and has taken it into her pretty\nlittle head that I am quite a gambler because I fix her stake at\nhalf-a-guinea.' 'What may not youth and beauty do!' said her Grace,\nlooking at Laura with a smile half-sly half-insinuating. 'When I was the\nMiss Montreville of my day, I too might have led the fashion of playing\nfor pence, though now I dare not venture even to countenance it.' The\nmere circumstance of rank could never discompose Laura; and, rather\ntaking encouragement from the charming though faded countenance of the\nspeaker, she replied, 'But, in consideration of having no pretensions to\nlead the fashion, may I not claim exemption from following it?' 'Oh, by\nno means,' said her Grace. 'When once you have entered the world of\nfashion, you must either be the daring leader or the humble follower. If\nyou choose the first, you must defy the opinions of all other people;\nand, if the last, you must have a suitable indifference for your own.'\n'A gentle intimation,' returned Laura, 'that in the world of fashion I\nam quite out of place, since nothing but my own opinion is more awful to\nme than that of others.' 'Miss Montreville,' said Lady Pelham, with an\naspect of vinegar, 'we all await your pleasure.' 'Pray, Madam,' answered\nLaura, 'do not let me detain you a moment; I shall easily dispose of\nmyself.' 'Take up your cards this instant, and let us have no more of\nthese airs,' said Lady Pelham, now without affectation whispering, in\norder to conceal from her elegant companions the wrath which was,\nhowever, distinctly written in her countenance.\n\nIt now occurred to Laura as strange, that so much trouble should be\ntaken to prevail upon her to play for more than she inclined. Hargrave,\nthough he had pretended to release her, still kept his seat, and his\nlanguage had tended rather to embarrass than relieve her. Mrs Clermont\nhad interfered further than Laura thought either necessary or proper;\nand Lady Pelham was eager to carry her point. Laura saw that there was\nsomething in all this which she did not comprehend; and, looking up to\nseek an explanation in the faces of her companions, she perceived that\nthe whole trio seemed waiting her decision with looks of various\ninterest. The piercing black eyes of Mrs Clermont were fixed upon her\nwith an expression of sly curiosity. Hargrave hastily withdrew a\nsidelong glance of anxious expectation; while Lady Pelham's face was\nflushed with angry impatience of delay. 'Has your Ladyship any\nparticular reason for wishing that I should play for a higher stake than\nI think right?' said Laura, fixing on her aunt a look of calm scrutiny.\nToo much out of humour to be completely on her guard, Lady Pelham's\ncolour deepened several shades, while she answered, 'I child! what\nshould make you think so?' 'I don't know,' said Laura. 'People sometimes\ntry to _convince_ from mere love of victory; but they seldom take the\ntrouble to _persuade_ without some other motive.' 'Any friend,' said\nLady Pelham, recollecting herself, 'would find motive enough for what I\nhave done, in the absurd appearance of these littlenesses to the world,\nand the odium that deservedly falls on a young miser.' 'Nay, Lady\nPelham,' said the Dutchess, 'this is far too severe. Come,' added she,\nbeckoning to Laura, with a gracious smile, 'you shall sit by me, that I\nmay endeavour to enlarge your conceptions on the subject of\ncard-playing.'\n\nLaura, thus encouraged, instantly begged her aunt's permission to pass.\nLady Pelham could not decently refuse; and, venting her rage, by\npinching Laura's arm till the blood came, and muttering through her\nclenched teeth, 'obstinate wretch,' she suffered her niece to escape.\nLaura did not condescend to bestow any notice upon this assault, but,\npulling her glove over her wounded arm, took refuge beside the Dutchess.\nThe fascinating manners of a high-bred woman of fashion, and the\nrespectful attentions offered to her whom the Dutchess distinguished by\nher particular countenance, made the rest of the evening pass agreeably,\nin spite of the evident ill-humour of Lady Pelham. Her ladyship\nrestrained the further expression of her rage till Laura and she were on\ntheir way home; when it burst out in reproaches of the parsimony,\nobstinacy, and perverseness which had appeared in her niece's refusal to\nplay. Laura listened to her in silence; sensible, that while Lady\nPelham's passion overpowered the voice of her own reason, it was vain to\nexpect that she should hear reason from another. But, next day, when she\njudged that her aunt had had time to grow cool, she took occasion to\nresume the subject; and explained, with such firmness and precision, her\nprinciples in regard to the uses of money and the accountableness of its\npossessors, that Lady Pelham laid aside thoughts of entangling her by\nmeans of play; since it was vain to expect that she would commit to the\npower of chance that which she habitually considered as the sacred\ndeposit of a father, and specially destined for the support and comfort\nof his children.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nHargrave no sooner perceived the futility of his design to involve Laura\nin a debt of honour, than he laid aside the disguise which had been\nassumed to lull her vigilance, and which he had never worn without\ndifficulty. He condescended, however, to save appearance, by taking\nadvantage of the idea which Laura had herself suggested to Lady Pelham,\nand averred that he had made a powerful effort to recover his\nself-possession; but he declared that, having totally failed in his\nendeavours to obtain his liberty, he was determined never to renew them,\nand would trust to time and accident for removing Laura's prejudice. In\nvain did she assure him that no time could produce such a revolution in\nher sentiments as would at all avail him; that though his eminent\nimprovement in worth might secure her esteem, her affections were\nalienated beyond recall. The old system was resumed, and with greater\nvigour than before, because with less fear of observation and more\nfrequent opportunities of attack. Every meal, every visit, every public\nplace, furnished occasions for his indefatigable assiduities, from which\nLaura found no refuge beyond the precincts of her own chamber.\n\nRegardless of the vexation which such a report might give her, he chose\nto make his suit a subject of the tittle-tattle of the day. By this\nmanoeuvre, in which he had before found his advantage, he hoped that\nseveral purposes might be served. The publicity of his claim would keep\nother pretenders at a distance; it would oblige those who mentioned him\nto Laura to speak, if not favourably, at least with decent caution; and\nit might possibly at last induce her to listen with less reluctance to\nwhat every one spoke of as natural and probable. Lady Pelham seconded\nhis intentions, by hints of her niece's engagement, and confidential\ncomplaints to her friends of the _mauvaise honte_ which made Laura\ntreat with such reserve the man to whom she had long been affianced. The\nconsequence of their manoeuvring was, that Hargrave's right to persecute\nLaura seemed universally acknowledged. The men, at his approach, left\nher free to his attendance; the women entertained her with praises of\nhis person, manners, and equipage; with hints of her situation, too\ngentle to warrant direct contradiction; or charges made with conviction\ntoo strong to yield any form of denial.\n\nLady Pelham, too, resumed her unwearied remonstrances, and teased,\nchided, argued, upbraided, entreated, and scolded, through every tedious\nhour in which the absence of visitors left Laura at her mercy. Laura had\nat one time determined against submitting to such treatment, and had\nresolved, that, if it were renewed, she would seek a refuge far from her\npersecutors, and from England. But that resolution had been formed when\nthere appeared no immediate necessity for putting it in practice; and\nEngland contained somewhat to which Laura clung almost unconsciously.\nAmidst all her vexations, Mrs De Courcy's letters soothed her ruffled\nspirits; and more than once, when she renewed her determination to quit\nLady Pelham, a few lines from Norwood made her pause in its fulfilment,\nreminding her that a few months, however unpleasing, would soon steal\naway, and that her return to the country would at least bring some\nmitigation of her persecutions.\n\nThough Mrs De Courcy wrote often, and confidentially, she never\nmentioned Montague further than was necessary to avoid particularity.\nShe said little of his health, nothing of his spirits or occupations,\nand never hinted any knowledge of his rejected love. Laura's inquiries\nconcerning him were answered with vague politeness; and thus her\ninterest in the state of his mind was constantly kept awake. Often did\nshe repeat to herself, that she hoped he would soon learn to consider\nher merely as a friend; and that which we have often repeated as truth,\nwe in time believe to be true.\n\nLaura had been in town about a month, when one of her letters to Norwood\nwas followed by a longer silence than usual. She wrote again, and still\nthe answer was delayed. Fearing that illness prevented Mrs De Courcy\nfrom writing, Laura had endured some days of serious anxiety, when a\nletter was brought her, addressed in Montague's hand. She hastily tore\nit open, and her heart fluttered between pleasure and apprehension, when\nshe perceived that the whole letter was written by him. It was short and\ncautious. He apologized for the liberty he took, by saying, that a\nrheumatic affection having prevented his mother from using her pen, she\nhad employed him as her secretary, fearing to alarm Laura by longer\nsilence. The letter throughout was that of a kind yet respectful friend.\nNot a word betrayed the lover. The expressions of tender interest and\nremembrance with which it abounded, were ascribed to Mrs De Courcy, or\nat least shared with her, in a manner which prevented any embarrassment\nin the reply. Laura hesitated for a moment, whether her answer should be\naddressed to Mrs De Courcy, or to Montague; but Montague was her\nbenefactor, their intimacy was sanctioned by her best friend, and it is\nnot difficult to imagine how the question was decided. Her answer\nproduced a reply, which again was replied to in its turn; and thus a\ncorrespondence was established, which, though at first constrained and\nformal, was taught by Montague's prudent forbearance, to assume a\ncharacter of friendly ease.\n\nThis correspondence, which soon formed one of Laura's chief pleasures,\nshe never affected to conceal from Lady Pelham. On the contrary, she\nspoke of it with perfect openness and candour. Unfortunately, however,\nit did not meet with her Ladyship's approbation. She judged it highly\nunfavourable to her designs in regard to Hargrave. She imagined that, if\nnot already an affair of love, it was likely soon to become so; and she\nbelieved that, at all events, Laura's intercourse with the De Courcys\nwould foster those antiquated notions of morality to which Hargrave owed\nhis ill success. Accordingly, she at first objected to Laura's new\ncorrespondence; then lectured on its impropriety and imprudence; and,\nlastly took upon her peremptorily to prohibit its continuance. Those who\nare already irritated by oppression, a trifle will at last rouse to\nresistance. This was an exercise of authority so far beyond Laura's\nexpectations, that it awakened her resolution to submit no longer to the\nimportunity and persecution which she had so long endured, but to depart\nimmediately for Scotland. Willing, however, to execute her purpose with\nas little expence of peace as possible, she did not open her intentions\nat the moment of irritation. She waited a day of serenity to propose her\ndeparture.\n\nIn order to procure the means of defraying the expence of her journey,\nit was become necessary to remind Lady Pelham of her loan, which\nappeared to have escaped her Ladyship's recollection. Laura,\naccordingly, one day gently hinted a wish to be repaid. Lady Pelham at\nfirst looked surprised, and affected to have forgotten the whole\ntransaction; but, upon being very distinctly reminded of the\nparticulars, she owned that she recollected something of it, and\ncarelessly promised to settle it soon; adding that she knew Laura had no\nuse for the money. Laura then frankly announced the purpose to which she\nmeant to apply it; saying, that, as her aunt was now surrounded by more\nagreeable society, she hoped she might, without inconvenience, be\nspared, and would therefore relieve Lady Pelham of her charge, by paying\na visit to Mrs Douglas. Rage flamed in Lady Pelham's countenance, while\nshe burst into a torrent of invective against her niece's ingratitude,\nand coldness of heart; and it mingled with triumph as she concluded by\nsaying,--'Do, Miss; by all means go to your precious Scotland, but find\nthe means as you best can; for not one penny will I give you for such a\npurpose. I have long expected some such fine freak as this, but I\nthought I should disappoint it.' Not daunted by this inauspicious\nbeginning, Laura, taking encouragement from her aunt's known\ninstability, again and again renewed the subject; but Lady Pelham's\npurposes, however easily shaken by accident or caprice, were ever\ninflexible to entreaty. 'She possessed,' she said, 'the means of\npreventing her niece's folly, and she was determined to employ them.'\nLaura burnt with resentment at the injustice of this determination. She\nacknowledged no right which Lady Pelham possessed to detain her against\nher own consent, and she considered the detention of her lawful property\nas little else than fraud. But perceiving that remonstrance was useless,\nshe judged it most prudent not to embitter, by vain recriminations, an\nintercourse from which she could not immediately escape. Without further\ncomplaint or upbraiding, she submitted to her fate; content with\nresolving to employ more discreetly the next payment of her annuity, and\nwith making a just but unavailing appeal to her aunt's generosity, by\nasserting the right of defencelessness to protection. Lady Pelham had\nnot the slightest idea of conceding any thing to this claim. On the\ncontrary, the certainty that Laura could not withdraw from her power,\nencouraged her to use it with less restraint. She invited Hargrave to a\ndegree of familiarity which he had not before assumed; admitted him at\nall hours; sanctioned any freedom which he dared to use with Laura; and\nforced or inveigled her into frequent t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aates with him.\n\nFretted beyond her patience, Laura's temper more than once failed under\nthis treatment, and she bitterly reproached Hargrave as the source of\nall her vexation. As it was, however, her habitual study to convert\nevery event of her life to the purposes of virtue, it soon occurred to\nher, that, during these compulsory interviews, she might become the\ninstrument of awakening her unworthy lover to more noble pursuits. Like\na ray of light, the hope of usefulness darted into her soul, shedding a\ncheering beam on objects which before were dark and comfortless; and,\nwith all the enthusiastic warmth of her character, she entered on her\nvoluntary task; forgetting, in her eagerness to recal a sinner from the\nerror of his ways, the weariness, disgust, and dread with which she\nlistened to the ravings of selfish passion. She no longer endeavoured to\navoid him, no longer listened to him with frozen silence or avowed\ndisdain. During their interviews, she scarcely noticed his\nprotestations, but employed every interval in urging him, with all the\neloquence of dread, to retreat from the gulf which was yawning to\nreceive him; in assuring him, with all the solemnity of truth, that the\nwaters of life would repay him a thousand-fold for the poisoned cup of\npleasure. Truth, spoken by the loveliest lips in the world, confirmed by\nthe lightnings of a witching eye, kindled at times in Hargrave a\nsomething which he mistook for the love of virtue. He declared his\nabhorrence of his former self, asserted the innocence of his present\nmanner of life, and vowed that, for the future, he should be blameless.\nBut when Laura rather incautiously urged him to give proof of his\nreformation, by renouncing a passion whose least gratifications were\npurchased at the expence of justice and humanity, he insisted that she\nrequired more than nature could endure, and vehemently protested that he\nwould never, but with life, relinquish the hope of possessing her. Her\nremonstrances had however one effect, of which she was altogether\nunconscious. Hargrave could not estimate the force of those motives\nwhich led her to labour so earnestly for the conversion of a person\nwholly indifferent to her; and though she often assured him that her\nzeal was disinterested, he cherished a hope that she meant to reward his\nimprovement. In this hope he relinquished, for a while, the schemes\nwhich he had devised against the unsuspecting Laura, till accident again\ndecided him against trusting to her free consent for the accomplishment\nof his wishes.\n\nAmong other exercises of authority to which Lady Pelham was emboldened\nby her niece's temporary dependence on her will, she adhered to her\nformer prohibition of Laura's correspondence with De Courcy. Laura,\nunwilling to make it appear a matter of importance, promised that she\nwould desist; but said that she must first write to Mr De Courcy to\naccount for her seeming caprice. Lady Pelham consented, and the letter\nwas written. It spoke of Laura's situation, of her sentiments, of her\nregret for Hargrave's strange perseverance, of the dread and vexation to\nwhich he occasionally subjected her. To atone for its being the last, it\nwas more friendly, more communicative than any she had formerly written.\nLaura meant to disguise under a sportive style the effects which\noppression had produced upon her spirits; and the playful melancholy\nwhich ran throughout, gave her expressions an air of artless tenderness.\nLady Pelham passed through the hall as this letter was lying upon the\ntable, waiting for the servant who was to carry it to the post; she\nlooked at it. The sheet was completely filled. She wondered what it\ncould contain. She took it up and examined it, as far as the seal would\npermit her. What she saw did but increase her curiosity. It was only\nwafered, and therefore easily opened; but then it was so dishonourable\nto open a letter. Yet what could the letter be the worse? A girl should\nhave no secrets from her near relations. Still, to break a seal!--It was\nfelony by the law. Lady Pelham laid down the letter and walked away,\nalready proud of having disdained to do a base action; but she heard the\nservant coming for his charge; she thought it best to have time to\nconsider the matter. She could give him the letter at any time--and she\nslipped it into her pocket.\n\nSad sentence is produced against 'the woman who deliberates:' Lady\nPelham read the letter; and then, in the heat of her resentment at the\nmanner in which her favourite was mentioned, shewed it to Hargrave. As\nhe marked the innocent confiding frankness, the unconstrained respect,\nthe chastened yet avowed regard, with which Laura addressed his rival,\nand contrasted them with the timid caution which, even during the reign\nof passion, had characterized her intercourse with himself,--contrasted\nthem too with the mixture of pity, dislike, and dread, which had\nsucceeded her infatuation, all the pangs of rage and jealousy took hold\non the soul of Hargrave. He would have vented his frenzy by tearing the\nletter to atoms, but Lady Pelham snatched it from his quivering grasp,\nand dreading detection, sealed and restored it to its first destination.\n\nThe first use which he made of his returning powers of self-command, was\nto urge Lady Pelham's concurrence in a scheme which he had before\ndevised, but which had been laid aside in consequence of his ill-founded\nhopes. He entreated that her Ladyship would, by an opportune absence,\nassist his intention; which was, he said, to alarm Laura with the\nhorrors of a pretended arrest for an imaginary debt, and to work upon\nthe gratefulness of her disposition, by himself appearing as her\ndeliverer from her supposed difficulty. Lady Pelham in vain urged the\nfutility of this strategem, representing the obstacles to its\naccomplishment, and the certainty of early detection. Hargrave continued\nto importune, and she yielded.\n\nYet Hargrave himself was as far as Lady Pelham from expecting any fruits\nfrom the feeble artifice which he had detailed to her. He had little\nexpectation that Laura could ever be induced to receive any pecuniary\nobligation at his hands, and still less that she would consider a loan\nwhich she might almost immediately repay, as a favour important enough\nto be rewarded with herself. He even determined that his aid should be\noffered in terms which would ensure its rejection. Though he durst not\nventure to unfold his whole plan to Lady Pelham, his real intention was\nmerely to employ the disguise of the law in removing Laura from even the\nimperfect protection of her aunt, to a place where she would be utterly\nwithout defence from his power. To the baseness of his purpose he\nblinded himself by considering the reparation which he should make in\nbestowing wealth and title on his victim; its more than savage brutality\nhe forgot in anticipation of the gratitude with which Laura, humbled in\nher own eyes, and in those of the world, would accept the assiduities\nwhich now she spurned. He little knew the being whom he thus devoted to\ndestruction! Incited by jealousy and resentment, he now resolved on the\nimmediate execution of his design; and he did not quit Lady Pelham till\nhe had obtained her acquiescence in it so far as it was divulged to her.\nHe then hastened to prepare the instruments of his villainy; and ere he\ngave himself time to cool, all was in readiness for the scheme which was\nto break the innocent heart that had loved and trusted him in seeming\nvirtue, and pitied and prayed for him and warned him in guilt. How had\nthe shades of evil deepened since the time when Hargrave first faltered\nbetween his infant passion and a virtuous purpose! He had turned from\nthe path which 'shineth more and more unto the perfect day.' On that in\nwhich he trode the night was stealing, slow but sure, which closes at\nlast in outer darkness.\n\nOne morning at breakfast, Lady Pelham, with more than usual civility,\napologized for leaving Laura alone during the rest of the day, saying\nthat business called her but a few miles out of the town, but that she\nwould return in the evening. She did not say whither she was going; and\nLaura, never imagining that it could at all concern her to know, did not\nthink of inquiring. Pleasing herself with the prospect of one day of\npeace and solitude, she saw her aunt depart, and then sat down to detail\nto the friend of her youth her situation, her wishes, and her\nintentions. She was interrupted by a servant who came to inform her that\ntwo men below desired to speak with her. Wondering who in that land of\nstrangers could have business with her, Laura desired that they should\nbe shewn up stairs. Two coarse robust-looking men, apparently of the\nlower rank, entered the room. Laura was unable to divine what could have\nprocured her a visit from persons of their appearance; yet, with her\nnative courtesy, she was motioning them to a seat, when one of them\nstepped forward; and, laying on her shoulder a stick which he held,\nsaid, in a rough ferocious voice, 'Laura Montreville, I arrest you at\nthe suit of John Dykes.' Laura was surprised but not alarmed. 'This must\nbe some mistake,' said she, 'I know no such person as John Dykes.' 'He\nknows you though, and that is enough,' answered the man. 'Friend,'\nreturned Laura, mildly, 'you mistake me for some other person.' 'What,\nMiss,' said the other man, advancing, 'do you pretend that you are not\nLaura Montreville, daughter of the late Captain William Montreville, of\nGlenalbert in Scotland?' Laura, now changing colour, owned that she was\nthe person so described. 'But,' said she, recovering herself, 'I cannot\nbe arrested. I do not owe five shillings in the world.' 'Mayhap not,\nMiss,' said the man, 'but your father did; and you can be proved to have\nintermeddled with his effects as his heiress, which makes you liable for\nall his debts. So you'll please pay me the two hundred pounds which he\nowed to Mr John Dykes.' 'Two hundred pounds!' exclaimed Laura. 'The\nthing is impossible. My father left a list of his debts in his own\nhand-writing, and they have all been faithfully discharged by the sale\nof his property in Scotland.' The men looked at each other for a moment,\nand seemed to hesitate; but the roughest of the two presently answered,\n'What nonsense do you tell me of lists? who's to believe all that? I\nhave a just warrant; so either pay the money or come along.' 'Surely,\nfriend,' said Laura, who now suspected the people to be mere swindlers,\n'you cannot expect that I should pay such a sum without inquiring into\nyour right to demand it. If your claim be a just one, present it in a\nregular account, properly attested, and it shall be paid to-morrow.' 'I\nhave nothing to do with to-morrow, Miss,' said the man. 'I must do my\nbusiness. It's all one to me whether you pay or not. It does not put a\npenny in my pocket: only if you do not choose to pay, come along; for we\ncan't be standing here all day.' 'I cannot procure the money just now,\neven though I were willing,' answered Laura, with spirit, 'and I do not\nbelieve you have any right to remove me.' 'Oh, as for the right, Miss,\nwe'll let you see that. There is our warrant, properly signed and\nsealed. You may look at it in my hand, for I don't much like to trust\nyou with it.'\n\nThe warrant was stamped, and imposingly written upon parchment. With the\ntautology which Laura had been taught to expect in a law-paper, it rung\nchanges upon the permission to seize and confine the person of Laura\nMontreville, as heiress of William Montreville, debtor to John Dykes of\nPimlico. It was signed as by a magistrate, and marked with the large\nseals of office. Laura now no longer doubted; and, turning pale and\nfaint, asked the men whether they would not stay for an hour while she\nsent to Finsbury Square to beg the advice of Mr Derwent, Lady Pelham's\nman of business. 'You may send for him to the lock-up house,' said the\nsavage. 'We have no time to spare.' 'And whither will you take me?'\ncried Laura, almost sinking with horror. 'Most likely,' answered the\nmost gentle of the two ruffians, 'you would not like to be put into the\ncommon prison; and you may have as good accommodations in my house as\nmight serve a dutchess.'\n\nSpite of her dismay Laura's presence of mind did not entirely forsake\nher. She hesitated whether she should not send to beg the assistance of\nsome of Lady Pelham's acquaintance, or at least their advice in a\nsituation so new to her. Among them all there was none with whom she had\nformed any intimacy; none whom, in her present circumstances of\nembarrassment and humiliation, she felt herself inclined to meet. She\nshrunk at the thought of the form in which her story might be\nrepresented by the malignant or the misjudging, and she conceived it her\nbest course to submit quietly to an inconvenience of a few hours\ncontinuance, from which she did not doubt that her aunt's return would\nthat evening relieve her. Still the idea of being a prisoner; of\ncommitting herself to such attendants; of being an inmate of the abodes\nof misery, of degradation, perhaps of vice, filled her with dread and\nhorror, while, sinking on a couch, she covered her pale face with her\nhands, and inwardly commended herself to the care of heaven.\n\nThe men, meanwhile, stood whispering apart, and seemed to have forgotten\nthe haste which they formerly expressed. At last one of them, after\nlooking from the window into the street, suddenly approached her, and,\nrudely seizing her arm, cried, 'Come, Miss, the coach can't wait all\nday. It's of no use crying; we're too well used to that, so walk away if\nyou don't choose to be carried.' Laura dashed the tears from her eyes,\nand, faintly trying to disengage her arm, was silently following her\nconductor to the door, when it opened and Hargrave entered.\n\nPrepared as he was for a scene of distress, determined as he was to let\nno movement of compassion divert his purpose, he could not resist the\nquiet anguish which was written in the lovely face of his victim; and\nturning with real indignation to her tormentor, he exclaimed, 'Ruffian!\nwhat have you done to her?' But quickly recollecting himself, he threw\nhis arm familiarly round her, and said, 'My dearest Laura, what is the\nmeaning of all this? What can these people want with you?' 'Nothing\nwhich can at all concern you Sir,' said Laura, her spirit returning at\nthe boldness of his address. 'Nay, my dear creature,' said Hargrave, 'I\nam sure something terrible has happened. Speak, fellows,' said he,\nturning to his emissaries, 'what is your business with Miss\nMontreville?' 'No great matter, Sir,' answered the man; 'only we have a\nwrit against her for two hundred pounds, and she does not choose to pay\nit; so we must take her to a little snug place, that's all.' 'To a\nprison! You, Laura, to a prison! Heavens! it is not to be thought of.\nLeave the room fellows, and let me talk with Miss Montreville.' 'There\nis no occasion, Sir,' said Laura. 'I am willing to submit to a short\nconfinement. My aunt returns this evening, and she will undoubtedly\nadvance the money. It ought to be much the same to me what room I\ninhabit for the few intervening hours.' 'Good heaven! Laura do you\nconsider what you say? Do you consider the horrors--the disgrace?\nDearest girl, suffer me to settle this affair, and let me for once do\nsomething that may give you pleasure.' Laura's spirit revolted from the\nfreedom with which this was spoken. Suffering undeserved humiliation,\nnever had she been more jealous of her claim to respect. 'I am obliged\nto you, Sir,' said she, 'but your good offices are unnecessary. Some\nlittle hardship, I find, I must submit to; and I believe the smallest\nwithin my choice is to let these people dispose of me till Lady Pelham's\nreturn.' Hargrave reddened. 'She prefers a prison,' thought he, 'to\nowing even the smallest obligation to me. But her pride is near a fall;'\nand he smiled with triumphant pity on the stately mien of his victim.\n\nHe was, in effect, almost indifferent whether she accepted or rejected\nhis proffered assistance. If she accepted it, he was determined that it\nshould be clogged with a condition expressly stated, that he was for the\nfuture to be received with greater favour. If she refused, and he\nscarcely doubted that she would, he had only to make the signal, and she\nwould be hurried, unresisting, to destruction. Yet, recollecting the\ndespair, the distraction, with which she would too late discover her\nmisfortune; the bitter upbraidings with which she would meet her\nbetrayer; the frantic anguish with which she would mourn her disgrace,\nif, indeed, she survived it, he was inclined to wish that she would\nchoose the more quiet way of forwarding his designs, and he again\nearnestly entreated her to permit his interference. Laura's strong\ndislike to being indebted for any favour to Hargrave, was somewhat\nbalanced in her mind by the horror of a prison, and by the consideration\nthat she could immediately repay him by the sale of part of her annuity.\nThough she still resisted his offer, therefore, it was less firmly than\nbefore. Hargrave continued to urge her. 'If,' said he, 'you dislike to\nallow me the pleasure of obliging you, this trifling sum may be restored\nwhenever you please; and if you afterwards think that any little debt\nremains, it is in your power to repay it a thousand fold. One kind\nsmile, one consenting look, were cheaply purchased with a world.' The\nhint which concluded this speech seemed to Laura manifestly intended to\nprevent her acceptance of the offer which he urged so warmly. 'Are you\nnot ashamed, Sir,' said she, with a disdainful smile, 'thus to make a\nparade of generosity which you do not mean to practise? I know you do\nnot--cannot expect, that I should poorly stoop to purchase your\nassistance.' 'Upon my soul, Laura,' cried Hargrave, seizing her hands,\n'I am most earnest, most anxious, that you should yield to me in this\naffair; nor will I quit this spot till you have consented--nor till you\nhave allowed me to look upon your consent as a pledge of your future\nfavour.' Laura indignantly snatched her hands from his grasp. 'All that\nI comprehend of this,' said she, 'is insult, only insult. Leave me, Sir!\nIt is unworthy even of you to insult the misfortunes of a defenceless\nwoman.' Hargrave would not be repulsed. He again took her hand and\npersevered in his entreaties, not forgetting, however, to insinuate the\nconditions. Laura, in silent scorn, turned from him, wondering what\ncould be the motive of his strange conduct, till it suddenly occurred to\nher that the arrest might be a mere plot contrived by Hargrave himself\nfor the purpose of terrifying her into the acceptance of the conditions\nnecessary to her escape. This suspicion once formed gained strength by\nevery circumstance. The improbability of the debt; the time chosen when\nLady Pelham was absent; the opportune arrival of Hargrave; the\nsubmission of the pretended bailiffs to his order; his frequent\nrepetition of the conditions of his offer, at the same time that he\nappeared to wish for its acceptance; all conspired to convince Laura\nthat she was intended to be made the dupe of a despicable artifice.\nGlowing with indignation, she again forced herself from Hargrave. 'Away\nwith this contemptible mockery,' she cried, 'I will hear no more of it.\nWhile these people choose to guard me in this house, it shall be in an\napartment secure from your intrusion.' Then, before Hargrave could\nprevent her, she left him, and shut herself into her own chamber.\n\nHere, at greater liberty to think, a new question occurred to her. In\ncase of her refusal to accept of Hargrave's terms--in case she actually\npreferred intrusting herself to the pretended bailiffs, whither could\nthey intend to convey her? Laura's blood ran cold at the thought. If\nthey were indeed the agents of Hargrave, what was there of dreadful that\nshe had not to fear! Yet she could scarcely believe that persons could\nbe found to attempt so daring a villany. Would they venture upon an\noutrage for which they must answer to the laws! an outrage which Lady\nPelham would certainly feel herself concerned to bring to immediate\ndetection and punishment. 'Unfortunate chance!' cried Laura, 'that my\naunt should be absent just when she might have saved me. And I know not\neven where to seek her.--Why did she not tell me whither she was going?\nShe who was wont to be so open!--Can this be a part of this cruel snare?\nCould she--Oh it is impossible! My fears make me suspicious and unjust.'\n\nThough Laura thus endeavoured to acquit Lady Pelham, her suspicion of\nHargrave's treachery augmented every moment. While she remembered that\nher father, though he had spoken to her of his affairs with the most\nconfidential frankness, had never hinted at such a debt, never named\nsuch a person as his pretended creditor--while she thought of the manner\nof Hargrave's interference, the improbability that her own and her\nfather's name and address, as well as the casualty of Lady Pelham's\nabsence should be known to mere strangers--the little likelihood that\ncommon swindlers would endeavour to extort money by means so hazardous\nand with such small chance of success--her conviction rose to certainty;\nand she determined that nothing short of force should place her in the\npower of these impostors. Yet how soon might that force be employed!\nHow feeble was the resistance which she could offer! And who would\nventure to aid her in resisting the pretended servants of law!\n'Miserable creature that I am!' cried she, wringing her hands in an\nagony of grief and terror, 'must I submit to this cruel wrong?--Is there\nno one to save me--no friend near?--Yes! yes, I have a friend from whom\nno treachery of man can tear me--who can deliver me from their\nviolence--who can do more--can make their cruelty my passport to life\neternal. Let me not despair then--Let me not be wanting to myself.--With\nHis blessing the feeblest means are mighty.'\n\nAfter a moment's consideration Laura rung her bell, and the maid who\nusually attended her appeared. 'Catherine,' said Laura, endeavouring to\nspeak composedly, 'will you oblige me by going to Finsbury Square, to Mr\nDerwent, and begging of him to come hither instantly?' 'Bless me,\nMadam,' cried the girl, 'you look as if you were just going to faint!\ncan I get you any thing?' 'No, no, I shall not faint,' said Laura. 'Go\nmy dear--go quickly--if you would save a wretch from destruction. Stop\nnot a moment I implore you!--Oh Catherine, more than life depends on\nyou!' The girl's curiosity was strongly excited by these words, as well\nas by the strange visit of the men who were waiting in the lobby. She\nwould fain have staid to make inquiries, but the imploring anguish of\nLaura's look and manner was irresistible, and she hastened out of the\nroom. Laura then double-locking the door determined that by force only\nit should be entered, and throwing herself on a seat, strove to rally\nthe spirits she was so soon to need. In a few minutes, however,\nCatherine returned, and through the key hole informed Laura that she had\nbeen intercepted by the men below stairs, who would not suffer any one\nto leave the house. 'All is then as I feared,' cried Laura in a voice of\ndesperation. 'And thus has he made his cruel plot so sure! Is there no\nescape! Oh Catherine! cannot you steal away from them? Is there no means\nto save me?' Moved by the voice of anguish, the girl promised to do her\nutmost, but confessed that she had little hope of succeeding.\n\nFor a moment Laura believed her fate sealed, and almost gave herself up\nto despair; but, now convinced of the treachery of Hargrave, and\nunwillingly obliged to suspect Lady Pelham's connivance, indignation at\nsuch unexampled baseness and cruelty again roused her fainting spirit.\nAgain she determined to resist to the uttermost, and if dragged by force\nfrom her place of refuge, to appeal to the humanity of the passengers\nin the street. 'Surely,' thought she, 'even common strangers will not\npermit such oppression.' The windows of her chamber looked towards the\ngardens behind the house; and she now regretted that she had not rather\nshut herself up in one of the front apartments, from whence she could\nhave explained her situation to the passers by. Seeing no other chance\nof escape, she resolved on attempting to change her place of refuge, and\nwas approaching the door to listen whether any one was near, when she\nwas startled by the rough voice of one of the pretended bailiffs. 'Come\nalong Miss,' he cried, 'we are quite tired of waiting. Come along.' The\nshuddering Laura made no reply. 'Come, come Miss,' cried the man again;\n'you have had time enough to make ready.' Laura continued silent, while\nthe ruffian called to her again and again, shaking the door violently.\nHe threatened, with shocking oaths, that he would burst it open, and\nthat she would be punished for resisting the officers of justice. All\nwas in vain. Laura would not answer a single word. Trembling in every\nlimb, she listened to his blasphemies and vows of vengeance, till she\nhad wearied out her persecutor, and her ear was gladdened with the sound\nof his departing. He was almost immediately succeeded by his less\nferocious companion, who more civilly begged her to hasten, as their\nbusiness would not permit any longer delay. Finding that she would not\nanswer, he reminded her of the consequences of obstructing the execution\nof the law; and threatened, if she continued obstinate, to use force.\nLaura sat silent and motionless, using every momentary interval of\nquiet, in breathing a hasty prayer for deliverance. The least violent of\nthe fellows proved the most persevering; yet at last she had the\nsatisfaction to hear him also retire. Presently a lighter step\napproached, and Hargrave called to her. 'Miss Montreville! Laura! Miss\nMontreville!' Laura was still silent. He called again, without success.\n'Miss Montreville is ill,' cried he aloud, as if to some one at a\ndistance. 'She is insensible. The door must be forced.' 'No! No!' cried\nLaura, determined not to leave him this pretence, 'I am not insensible,\nnor ill, if you would leave me in peace.' 'For heaven's sake, then,'\nreturned he, 'let me speak a few words to you.' 'No,' answered Laura,\n'you can say nothing that I wish to hear.' 'I beseech you, I implore\nyou,' said Hargrave, 'only by one word put it in my power to save you\nfrom these miscreants--say but that one little word, and you are free.'\n'Man, man!' cried Laura, vehemently, 'why will you make me abhor you? I\nwant no freedom but from your persecutions! Begone!' 'Only promise me,'\nsaid Hargrave, lowering his voice, 'only promise me that you will give\nup that accursed De Courcy, and I will dismiss these men.' 'Do you curse\nhim who saved your life! Monster! Leave me! I detest you.' Hargrave\ngnawed his lip with passion. 'You shall dearly pay for this obstinacy,'\nsaid he, and fiercely strode away.\n\nIn the heat of his wrath, he commanded his coadjutors to force the door;\nbut the law which makes the home of an Englishman a sacred sanctuary,\nextends its precious influence, in some faint degree, to the breasts\neven of the dregs of mankind; and these wretches, who would have given\nup Laura to any other outrage, hesitated to perpetrate this. They\nobjected the danger. 'Does your Honour think,' said one of them, 'that\nthe servants will stand by and allow us to break open the door.' 'I tell\nyou,' said Hargrave, 'all the men-servants are from home. What do you\nfear from a parcel of women?' 'Women can bear witness as well as men,\nyour Honour; and it might be as much as our necks are worth to be\nconvicted. But if your Honour could entice her out, we'd soon catch\nher.' Hargrave took two or three turns along the lobby, and then\nreturned to Laura. 'Miss Montreville,' said he, 'my dearest Miss\nMontreville, I conjure you to admit me only for a moment. These savages\nwill wait no longer. They are determined to force your door. Once more I\nimplore you, before it is too late, let me speak with you. I expect them\nevery moment.' Laura's breast swelled with indignation at this vile\npretence of kindness. 'Acting under your commands, Sir,' said she, 'I\ndoubt not that they may even dare this outrage. And let them at their\nperil. If the laws of my country cannot protect, they shall avenge me.'\nFor a moment Hargrave stood confounded at this detection, till anger\nreplacing shame,--'Very well, Madam,' he cried; 'insult me as you\nplease, and take the consequences.' He then rejoined his emissaries; and\nby bribery and threats endeavoured to prevail upon them to consummate\ntheir violence. The men, unwilling to forfeit the reward of the hazard\nand trouble they had already undergone, allured by Hargrave's promises,\nand fearing his vengeance, at last agreed to drag their hapless victim\nto her doom.\n\nHaving taken such instruments as they could find, for the purpose of\nforcing the door, they followed Hargrave up stairs, and prepared to\nbegin their work. At this near prospect of the success of all his\nschemes, Hargrave's rage began to cool; and a gleam of tenderness and\nhumanity reviving in his heart, he shrunk from witnessing the anguish\nwhich he was about to inflict. 'Stop,' said he to his people, who were\napproaching the door; 'stay a few moments;' and, putting his hand to his\nforehead, he walked about, not wavering in his purpose, but endeavouring\nto excuse it to himself. 'It is all the consequence of her own\nobstinancy,' said he, suddenly stopping. 'You may go on--No; stay, let\nme first get out of this house. Her cries would drive me mad.--Make\nhaste--lose no time after I am gone. It is better over.'\n\nBesides the motive which he owned, Hargrave was impelled to depart by\nthe dread of meeting Laura's upbraiding eye, and by the shame of\nappearing even to the servants, who were so soon to know his baseness,\nan inactive spectator of Laura's distress. He hastened from the house,\nand the men proceeded in their work. With dread and horror did Laura\nlisten to their attempts. Pale, breathless, her hands clenched in\nterror, she fixed her strained eyes upon the door, which every moment\nseemed yielding; then flying to the window, surveyed in despair the\nheight, which made escape an act of suicide; then again turning to the\ndoor, tried with her feeble strength to aid its resistance. In vain! It\nyielded, and the shock threw Laura upon the ground. The ruffians raised\nher, more dead then alive, and were seizing her lily arms to lead her\naway; but, with all her native majesty, she motioned them from her. 'You\nneed not touch me,' said she, 'you see I can resist no further.' With\nthe composure of despair, she followed them to the hall, where, her\nstrength failing, she sunk upon a seat. The servants now in pity and\namazement approaching her, she addressed herself to one of them. 'Will\nyou go with me, my good friend,' said she, 'that you may return and tell\nLady Pelham where to find her niece's corpse!' The girl consented with\ntears in her eyes; but one of the fellows cried, 'No; no; she may run\nafter the coach if she likes, but she don't go within side.' 'Why not?'\nsaid the other, with a brutal leer. 'They may both get home again\ntogether. They'll be free enough soon.' Laura shuddered. 'Where wandered\nmy senses,' said she, 'when I thought of subjecting any creature to the\nchance of a fate like mine! Stay here, my dear, and tell Lady Pelham,\nthat I charge her, by all her hopes here and hereafter, to seek me\nbefore she sleeps. Let her seek me wherever there is wickedness and\nwo--and there, living or dead, I shall be found.' 'Let's have done with\nall this nonsense,' said one of the men. 'John, make the coach draw up\nclose to the door.' The fellow went to do as he was desired; while the\nother with a handkerchief prepared to stifle the cries of Laura, in\ncase she should attempt to move the pity of passengers in the street.\nLaura heard the carriage stop, she heard the step let down, and the\nsound was like her death knell.\n\nThe man hurried her through the hall. He opened the street door--and\nCatherine entered with Mr Derwent. Laura, raising her bowed-down head,\nuttered a cry of joy. 'I am safe!' she cried, and sunk into the arms of\nCatherine.\n\nMr Derwent immediately directed his servants to seize the fellow who had\nheld Laura, the other having made his escape upon seeing the arrival of\nher deliverers. Laura, soon recovering, told her tale to Mr Derwent, who\nordering the man to be searched, examined the warrant, and declared it\nto be false. The danger attending forgery, however, had been avoided,\nfor there was no magistrate of the same name with that which appeared in\nthe signature. Hargrave's villany thus fully detected, Laura wished to\ndismiss his agent; but Mr Derwent would not permit such atrocity to go\nunpunished, and gave up the wretch to the arm of law. He then quitted\nLaura, leaving his servant to attend her till Lady Pelham's return and,\nworn out with the emotion she had undergone, she threw herself on a bed\nto seek some rest.\n\nEarly in the evening Lady Pelham returned, and immediately inquired for\nher niece. The servants, always attentive and often uncharitable\nspectators of the actions of their superiors, had before observed the\nencouragement which their mistress gave to Hargrave, and less unwilling\nto suspect than Laura, were convinced of Lady Pelham's connivance in his\npurpose. None of them therefore choosing to announce the failure of a\nscheme in which they believed her so deeply implicated, her questions\nproduced no information except that Miss Montreville was gone indisposed\nto bed. The habitual awe with which the good sense and discernment of\nLaura had inspired Lady Pelham, was at present augmented almost to fear\nby the consciousness of duplicity. She shrunk from encountering the\nglance of quiet scrutiny, the plain direct question which left no room\nfor prevarication, no choice between simple truth and absolute\nfalsehood. But curiosity to know the success of the plot, and still more\na desire to discover how far she was suspected of abetting it, prevailed\nover her fears; and having before studied the part she was to play, she\nentered Laura's apartment.\n\nShe found her already risen and prepared to receive her. 'My dear\nchild,' said her Ladyship in one of her kindest tones, 'I am told you\nhave been ill. What is the matter?' 'My illness is nothing, Madam,'\nanswered Laura, 'but I have been alarmed in your absence by the most\ndaring, the most unprincipled outrage!' 'Outrage, my dear!' cried Lady\nPelham in a voice of the utmost surprise; 'What outrage?' Laura then,\ncommanding by a powerful effort the imagination which swelled her heart,\nrelated her injuries without comment; pausing at times to observe how\nher aunt was affected by the recital. Lady Pelham was all amazement;\nwhich, though chiefly pretended, was partly real. She was surprised at\nthe lengths to which Hargrave had gone, and even suspected his whole\ndesign, though she was far from intending to discover her sentiments to\nher niece. 'This is the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of!' cried\nshe when Laura had ended. 'What can have been the meaning of this trick?\nWhat can have incited the people?' 'Colonel Hargrave, Madam,' said Laura\nwithout hesitation. 'Impossible, my dear! Hargrave can be no further\nconcerned in it, than so far as taking advantage of the accident to\nextort the promise of a little kindness from you. He would never have\nventured to send the men into my house on such an errand.' 'One of them\nconfessed to Mr Derwent, before the whole family, that Colonel Hargrave\nwas his employer.' 'Astonishing!' cried Lady Pelham. 'And what do you\nsuppose to have been Hargrave's intention?' 'I doubt not, Madam,'\nreturned Laura, commanding her voice, though resentment flashed from her\neyes, 'I doubt not that his intentions were yet more base and inhuman\nthan the means he employed. But whatever they were, I am certain he\nwould never have dared to entertain them, had it not been for the\nencouragement which your Ladyship has thought proper to give him.' 'I,\nchild!' cried Lady Pelham, truth in her colour contradicting the\nfalsehood of her tongue, 'Surely you do not think that I would encourage\nhim in such a plot!' 'No, Madam,' answered Laura, 'I hope and believe\nthat you are incapable of consenting to such wickedness. I allude only\nto the general countenance which you have always shewn to Colonel\nHargrave.' Lady Pelham could implicitly rely upon Laura's word; and\nfinding that she was herself unsuspected, she had leisure to attempt\npalliating the offence of her _proteg\u00c3\u00a9_. 'That countenance,' returned\nshe, 'shall be completely withdrawn for the future, if Hargrave does not\nexplain this strange frolic to my satisfaction.' 'Frolic, Madam!' cried\nLaura indignantly. 'If that name belongs to crimes which would disgrace\nbarbarians, then call this a frolic!' 'Come, my dear girl,' said Lady\nPelham, coaxingly throwing her arm round Laura, 'you are too much, and\nI must own, according to present appearances, justly irritated, to talk\nof this affair coolly tonight. To-morrow we shall converse about it. Now\nlet's go to tea.' 'No, Madam,' said Laura with spirit, for she saw\nthrough her aunt's intention of glossing over Hargrave's villany--'I\nwill never again expose myself to the chance of meeting a wretch whose\ncrimes are my abhorrence. I will not leave this room till I quit it for\never. Madam, you have often called me firm. Now I will prove to you that\nI am so. Give me the means to go hence in a manner becoming your niece,\nor my own limbs shall bear me to Scotland, and on the charity of my\nfellow-creatures will I rely for support.' 'I protest, my love,' cried\nLady Pelham, 'you are absolutely in a passion, I never saw you so angry\ntill now.' 'Your Ladyship never saw me have such reason for anger,'\nreplied Laura. 'I own I am angry, yet I know that my determination is\nright, and I assure you it will outlive the heat with which it is\nexpressed.'\n\nHad Laura's purpose been more placidly announced it would have roused\nLady Pelham to fury; but even those who have least command over their\ntempers have generalship enough to perceive the advantage of the attack;\nand the passion of a virago has commonly a patriarchal submission for\nits elder-born brother. Lady Pelham saw that Laura was in no humour for\ntrifling; she knew that her resolutions were not easily shaken; and she\nquitted her upon pretence of fatigue, but in reality that she might\nconsider how to divert her from the purpose which she had announced so\nperemptorily.\n\nLaura was every day becoming more necessary to her aunt, and to think of\nparting with her was seriously disagreeable. Besides, Laura's departure\nwould effectually blast the hopes of Hargrave; and what would then\nbecome of all Lady Pelham's prospects of borrowing consequence from the\nlovely young Countess of Lincourt? Never wanting in invention, Lady\nPelham thought of a hundred projects for preventing her niece's journey\nto Scotland. Her choice was fixed by a circumstance which she could not\nexclude from her consideration. The story of Hargrave's seditious plot\nwas likely soon to be made public. It was known to Mr Derwent, and to\nall her own household. Her conscience whispered that her connivance\nwould be suspected. Mr Derwent might be discreet; but what was to be\nexpected from the discretion of servants? The story would spread from\nthe footmen to the waiting-maids, and from these to their ladies, till\nit would meet her at every turn. Nor had her imprudent consent left her\nthe power of disclaiming all concern in it, by forbidding Hargrave her\nhouse, since he would probably revenge himself by disclosing her share\nin the strategem. Lady Pelham saw no better success of palliating these\nevils, than by dismissing her establishment and returning immediately to\nWalbourne; and she hoped, at the same time, that it might not be\nimpossible to prevail on Laura to change the direction of her journey.\nFor this purpose she began by beseeching her niece to lay aside thoughts\nof retiring to Scotland; and was beginning to recount all the\ndisadvantages of such a proceeding; but Laura would listen to no\nremonstrance on the subject; declaring that, if after what had happened,\nshe remained in a place where she was liable to such outrage, she should\nbe herself accountable for whatever evil might be the consequence. Lady\nPelham then proposed an immediate removal to Walbourne, artfully\ninsinuating that, if any cause of complaint should there arise, Laura\nwould be near the advice and assistance of her friends at Norwood, and\nof Mrs Bolingbroke. Laura was not without some wishes that pointed\ntowards Walbourne; but she remembered the importunities which she had\nthere endured, and she firmly resisted giving occasion to their renewal.\nLady Pelham had then recourse to tender upbraidings. 'Was it possible\nthat Laura, the only hope and comfort of her age, would quit her now,\nwhen she had so endeared herself to the widowed heart, reft of all other\ntreasure--now when increasing infirmity required her aid--now when the\neye which was so soon to close, was fixed on her as on its last earthly\ntreasure! Would Laura thus cruelly punish her for a crime in which she\nhad no share; a crime which she was willing to resent to the utmost of\nher niece's wishes!' Lady Pelham talked herself into tears, and few\nhearts of nineteen are hard enough to resist the tears of age. Laura\nconsented to accompany her aunt to Walbourne, provided that she should\nnever be importuned on the subject of Hargrave, nor even obliged to see\nhim. These conditions Lady Pelham solemnly promised to fulfil, and, well\npleased, prepared for her journey. Hargrave, however, waited on her\nbefore her departure, and excused himself so well on the score of his\npassion, his despair, and his eager desire to be allied to Lady Pelham,\nthat, after a gentle reprimand, he was again received into favour,\ninformed of the promises which had been made against him, and warned not\nbe discouraged if their performance could not immediately be dispensed\nwith. Of this visit Laura knew nothing; for she adhered to her\nresolution of keeping her apartment, nor ever crossed its threshold,\ntill, on the third day after her perilous adventure, the carriage was at\nthe door which conveyed her to Walbourne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nAs Lady Pelham's carriage passed the entrance of the avenue which led to\nNorwood, Laura sunk into a profound reverie; in the course of which she\nsettled most minutely the behaviour proper for her first meeting with De\nCourcy. She decided on the gesture of unembarrassed cordiality with\nwhich she was to accost him; intending her manner to intimate that she\naccounted him a friend, and only a friend. The awkwardness of a private\ninterview she meant to avoid by going to Norwood next day, at an hour\nwhich she knew that Montague employed in reading aloud to his mother.\nAll this excellent arrangement, however, was unfortunately useless.\nLaura was taking a very early ramble in what had always been her\nfavourite walk, when, at a sudden turn, she saw De Courcy not three\nsteps distant. Her white gown shining through the still leafless trees\nhad caught his attention, the slightest glimpse of her form was\nsufficient for the eye of love, and he had advanced prepared to meet\nher; while she, thus taken by surprise, stood before him conscious and\nblushing. At this confusion, so flattering to a lover, De Courcy's heart\ngave one bound of triumphant joy; but he was too modest to ascribe to\nlove what timidity might so well account for, and he prudently avoided\nreminding Laura, even by a look, of either his hopes or his wishes.\nQuickly recollecting herself, Laura entered into a conversation which,\nthough at first reserved and interrupted, returned by degrees to the\nconfidential manner which De Courcy had formerly won from her under the\ncharacter of her father's friend.\n\nThis confidence, so precious to him, De Courcy was careful never to\ninterrupt. From the time of Laura's return, he saw her almost daily. She\nmade long visits to Mrs De Courcy; he came often to Walbourne; they met\nin their walks, in their visits; they spent a week together under Mr\nBolingbroke's roof; yet De Courcy religiously kept his promise, nor ever\nwilfully reminded Laura that he had a wish beyond her friendship. Always\ngentle, respectful and attentive, he never invited observation by\ndistinguishing her above others who had equal claims on his politeness.\nShe only shared his assiduities with every other woman whom he\napproached; nor did he betray uneasiness when she, in her turn, received\nattentions from others. His prudent self-command, had the effect which\nhe intended; and Laura, in conversing with him, felt none of the reserve\nwhich may be supposed to attend intercourse with a rejected admirer. His\ncaution even at times deceived her. She recollected Mrs Douglas's\nprophecy, that 'his attachment would soon subside into friendly regard,'\nand imagined she saw its accomplishment. 'How happy are men in having\nsuch flexible affections,' thought she with a sigh. 'I wonder whether he\nhas entirely conquered the passion which, three short months ago, was to\n\"last through life--beyond life?\" I hope he has,' whispered she with a\ndeeper sigh; and she repeated it again--'I hope he has,'--as if by\nrepeating it, she would have ascertained that it was her real sentiment.\nYet, at other times, some little inadvertency, unheeded by less\ninterested observers, would awaken a doubt of De Courcy's self-conquest;\nand in that doubt Laura unconsciously found pleasure. She often\nreconsidered the arguments which her friend had used to prove that\npassion is unnecessary to the happiness of wedded life. She did not\nallow that she was convinced by them; but she half wished that she had\nhad an opportunity of weighing them before she had decided her fate with\nregard to De Courcy. Meanwhile, much of her time was spent in his\ncompany, and his presence had ever brought pleasure with it. Week after\nweek passed agreeably away, and the close of the winter atoned for the\ndisquiet which had marked its commencement.\n\nDuring all this time, Laura saw nothing of Hargrave. His visits, indeed,\nto Walbourne were more frequent than she supposed, but the only one of\nwhich she had been informed, Lady Pelham affected to announce to her,\nadvising her to avoid it by spending that day at Norwood. Since their\nreturn from town, her Ladyship had entirely desisted from her\nremonstrances in his favour, and Laura hoped that his last outrage had\nopened her aunt's eyes to the deformity of his character. And, could\nLady Pelham's end have been pursued without annoyance to any living\nbeing, it would long before have shared the perishable nature of her\nother purposes. But whatever conferred the invaluable occasion of\ntormenting, was cherished by Lady Pelham as the dearest of her\nconcerns; and she only waited fit opportunity to shew that she could be\nas stubborn in thwarting the wishes of others, as capricious in varying\nher own. De Courcy's attachment could not escape her penetration; and as\nshe was far from intending to desert the cause of Hargrave, she saw,\nwith displeasure, the progressive advancement of Laura's regard for the\nfriend of her father. Though she was sufficiently acquainted with Laura\nto know that chiding would effect no change in her sentiments or\nconduct, she had not temper enough to restrain her upbraidings on this\nsubject, but varied them with all the skill and perseverance of a\nveteran in provocation. 'She did not, she must confess, understand the\ndelicacy of ladies whose affections could be transferred from one man to\nanother. She did not see how any modest woman could find two endurable\nmen in the world. It was a farce to tell her of friendship and\ngratitude, and such like stuff. Everybody knew the meaning of a\nfriendship between a girl of nineteen and a good-looking young fellow of\nfive-and-twenty. She wondered whether Laura was really wise enough to\nimagine that De Courcy could afford to marry her; or whether, if he were\nmad enough to think of such a thing, she could be so ungenerous as to\ntake advantage of his folly, to plunge him into irretrievable poverty;\nand this too, when it was well known that a certain young heiress had\nprior claims upon him.' Laura at first listened to these harangues with\ntolerable _sang froid_; yet they became, she was unconscious why, every\nday more provoking. Though she had self-command enough to be silent, her\nchanging colour announced Lady Pelham's victory, and it was followed up\nwithout mercy or respite. It had, however, no other effect than that of\nimposing a restraint when her Ladyship happened to be present; for De\nCourcy continued his attentions, and Laura received him with increasing\nfavour.\n\nLady Pelham omitted none of the minor occasions of disturbing this\nharmonious intercourse. She interrupted their t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aates, beset them\nin their walks, watched their most insignificant looks, pried into their\nmost common-place messages, and dexterously hinted to the one whatever\nfoible she could see or imagine in the other. A casual breath of scandal\nsoon furnished her with a golden opportunity of sowing dissension, and\nshe lost no time in taking advantage of the hint. 'It is treating me\nlike a baby,' said she once to Laura, after opening in form her daily\nattack; 'it is treating me like a mere simpleton to expect that you are\nto deceive me with your flourishing sentiments about esteem and\ngratitude. Have esteem and gratitude the blindness of love? Don't I see\nthat you overlook in your beloved Mr Montague De Courcy faults which in\nanother you would think sufficient excuse for any ill treatment that you\nchose to inflict?' Laura kept silence; for of late she had found that\nher temper could not stand a charge of this kind. 'What becomes of all\nyour fine high-flown notions of purity, and so forth,' continued Lady\nPelham, 'when you excuse his indiscretions with his mother's _proteg\u00c3\u00a9e_,\nand make a favourite and a plaything of his spoilt bantling?' Laura\nturned pale, then reddened violently. 'What proteg\u00c3\u00a9e? what bantling?'\ncried she, quite thrown off her guard. 'I know of no indiscretions--I\nhave no playthings.'--'What! you pretend not to know that the brat he\ntakes so much notice of is his own. Did you never hear of his affair\nwith a pretty girl whom his mamma was training as a waiting-maid for her\nfine-lady daughter.' 'Mr De Courcy, Madam!' cried Laura, making a\npowerful struggle with her indignation--'He seduce a girl who as a\nmember of his family was doubly entitled to his protection! Is it\npossible that your Ladyship can give credit to such a calumny?'\n'Heyday,' cried Lady Pelham, with a provoking laugh, 'a most incredible\noccurrence to be sure! And pray why should your immaculate Mr De Courcy\nbe impeccable any more than other people?' 'I do not imagine, Madam,'\nreturned Laura, with recovered self-possession, 'that Mr De Courcy, or\nany of the human race, is perfectly sinless; but nothing short of proof\nshall convince me that he is capable of deliberate wickedness; or even\nthat the casual transgressions of such a man can be so black in their\nnature, so heinous in their degree. It were next to a miracle if one who\nmakes conscience of guarding his very thoughts, could, with a single\nstep, make such progress in iniquity.' 'It were a miracle indeed,' said\nLady Pelham, sneeringly, 'if you could be prevailed upon to believe any\nthing that contradicts your romantic vagaries. As long as you are\ndetermined to worship Mr De Courcy, you'll never listen to any thing\nthat brings him down from his pedestal.' 'It is wasting time,' returned\nLaura calmly, 'to argue on the improbability of this malicious tale. I\ncan easily give your Ladyship the pleasure of being able to contradict\nit. Mrs Bolingbroke is at Norwood. She will tell me frankly who is the\nreal father of little Henry, and I shall feel no difficulty in asking\nher. Will you have the goodness to lend me the carriage for an hour?' 'A\npretty expedition truly!' cried Lady Pelham, 'and mighty delicate and\ndignified it is for a young lady, to run about inquiring into the\npedigree of all the bastards in the county! I assure you, Miss\nMontreville, I shall neither countenance nor assist such a scheme!'\n'Then, Madam,' answered Laura coolly, 'I shall walk to Norwood. The\nclaims of dignity, or even of delicacy, are surely inferior to those of\njustice and gratitude. But though it should subject me to the scorn of\nall mankind, I will do what in me lies to clear his good name whose\nkindness ministered the last comforts that sweetened the life of my\nfather.'\n\nThe manner in which these words were pronounced, shewed Lady Pelham that\nresistance was useless. She was far from wishing to quarrel with the De\nCourcy family, and she now began to fear that she should appear the\npropagator of this scandal. Having little time to consult the means of\nsafety, since Laura was already leaving the room, she hastily said, 'I\nsuppose in your explanations with Mrs Bolingbroke, you will give me up\nfor your authority?' 'No, Madam,' replied Laura, with a scorn which she\ncould not wholly suppress, 'your Ladyship has no right to think so at\nthe moment when I am shewing such concern for the reputation of my\nfriends.' Lady Pelham would have fired at this disdain, but her\n_quietus_ was at hand--she was afraid of provoking Laura to expose her,\nand therefore she found it perfectly possible to keep her temper. 'If\nyou are resolved to go,' said she, 'you had better wait till I order the\ncarriage; I fear we shall have rain.' Laura at first refused; but Lady\nPelham pressed her, with so many kind concerns for a slight cold which\nshe had, that though she saw through the veil, she suffered her Ladyship\nto wear it undisturbed. The carriage was ordered, and Laura hastened to\nNorwood.\n\nThough she entertained not the slightest doubt of De Courcy's integrity,\nshe was restless and anxious. It was easy to see that her mind was\npre-occupied during the few minutes which passed before, taking leave of\nMrs De Courcy, she begged Mrs Bolingbroke to speak with her apart.\nHarriet followed her into another room; and Laura, with much more\nembarrassment than she had expected to feel, prepared to begin her\ninterrogation. Harriet, from the thoughtful aspect of her companion,\nanticipating something of importance, stood gravely waiting to hear what\nshe had to say; while Laura was confused by the awkwardness of\nexplaining her reason for the question she was about to ask. 'I have\nmanaged this matter very ill,' said she at last, pursuing her thoughts\naloud. 'I have entered on it with so much formality, that you must\nexpect some very serious affair; and, after all, I am only going to ask\na trifling question. Will you tell me who is the father of my pretty\nlittle Henry?' Harriet looked surprised, and answered,--'Really, my\ndear, I am not sure that I dare. You inquired the same thing once\nbefore; and just when I was going to tell you, Montague looked so\nterrible, that I was forced to hold my tongue. But what makes you ask?\nWhat! You won't tell? Then I know how it is. My prophecy has proved\ntrue, and the good folks have given him to Montague himself. Ah! What a\ntell-tale face you have, Laura! And who has told you this pretty story?'\n'It is of no consequence,' replied Laura, 'that you should know my\nauthority, provided that I have yours to contradict the slander.' 'You\nshall have better authority than mine,' returned Harriet. 'Those who\nwere malicious enough to invent such a tale of Montague, might well\nassert that his sister employed falsehood to clear him. You shall hear\nthe whole from nurse Margaret herself; and her evidence cannot be\ndoubted. Come, will you walk to the cottage and hear what she has to\nsay?'\n\nThey found Margaret alone; and Harriet, impatient till her brother\nshould be fully justified, scarcely gave herself time to answer the old\nwoman's civilities, before she entered on her errand. 'Come, nurse,'\nsaid she, with all her natural frankness of manner, 'I have something\nparticular to say to you. Let's shut the door and sit down. Do you know\nsomebody has been malicious enough to tell Miss Montreville that\nMontague is little Henry's father.' Margaret lifted up her hands and\neyes. 'My young master, Madam!' cried she--'He go to bring shame and\nsorrow into any honest man's family! If you'll believe me, Miss,'\ncontinued she, turning to Laura, 'this is, begging your pardon, the\nwickedest lie that ever was told.' Laura was about to assure her that\nshe gave no credit to the calumny, but Harriet, who had a double reason\nfor wishing that her friend should listen to Margaret's tale,\ninterrupted her, saying, 'Nurse, I am sure nothing could convince her so\nfully as hearing the whole story from your own lips. I brought her\nhither on purpose; and you may trust her, I assure you, for she is just\nsuch a wise prudent creature as you always told me that I ought to be.'\n'Ah, Madam,' answered Margaret, 'I know that; for John says she is the\nprettiest-behaved young lady he ever saw; and says how fond my lady is\nof her, and others too besides my lady, though it is not for servants to\nbe making remarks.' 'Come, then, nurse,' said Harriet, 'sit down between\nus; and tell us the whole sad story of my poor foster-sister, and clear\nyour friend Montague from this aspersion.' Margaret did as she was\ndesired. 'Ah, yes!' said she, tears lending to her eyes a transient\nbrightness, 'I can talk of it now! Many a long evening John and I speak\nof nothing else. She always used to sit between us,--but now we both sit\nclose together. But we are growing old,' continued she, in a more\ncheerful tone, 'and in a little while we shall see them all again. We\nhad three of the prettiest boys!--My dear young lady, you will soon have\nchildren of your own, but never set your heart upon them, nor be too\nproud of them, for that is only provoking Providence to take them away.'\n'I shall probably never have so much reason,' said Harriet, 'as you had\nto be proud of your Jessy.' The mother's pride had survived its object;\nand it brightened Margaret's faded countenance, as, pressing Harriet's\nhand between her own, she cried, 'Ah, bless you! you were always kind to\nher. She was indeed the flower of my little flock; and when the boys\nwere taken away, she was our comfort for all. But I was too proud of\nher. Five years since, there was not her like in all the country round.\nA dutiful child, too, and never made us sad or sorrowful till--and such\na pretty modest creature! But I was too proud of her.'\n\nMargaret stopped, and covered her face with the corner of her apron.\nSympathizing tears stood in Laura's eyes; while Harriet sobbed aloud at\nthe remembrance of the play-fellow of her infancy. The old woman first\nrecovered herself. 'I shall never have done at this rate,' said she,\nand, drying her eyes, turned to address the rest of her tale to Laura.\n'Well, Ma'am, a gentleman who used to come a-visiting to the castle, by\nill fortune chanced to see her; and ever after that he noticed her and\nspoke to her; and flattered me up, too, saying, what a fine-looking\nyoung creature she was, and so well brought up too, and what a pity it\nwas that she should be destined for a tradesman's wife. So, like a fool\nas I was, I thought no harm of his fine speeches, because Jessy always\nsaid he behaved quite modest and respectful like. But John, to be sure,\nwas angry, and said that a tradesman was her equal, and that he hoped\nher rosy cheeks would never give her notions above her station; and,\nsays he,--I am sure many and many a time I have thought of his\nwords--says he, 'God grant I never see worse come of her than to be an\nhonest tradesman's wife.' My young master, too, saw the gentleman one\nday speaking to her; and he was so good as advise her himself, and told\nher that the gentleman meant nothing honest by all his fine speeches. So\nafter that, she would never stop with him at all, nor give ear to a word\nof his flatteries; but always ran away from him, telling him to say\nthose fine things to his equals. So, one unlucky day I had some matters\nto be done in the town, and Jessy said she would like to go, and poor\nfoolish I was so left to myself that I let her go. So she dressed\nherself in her clean white gown.--I remember it as were it but\nyesterday. I went to the door with her, charging her to be home early.\nShe shook hands with me. Jessy, says I, you look just like a bride. So\nshe smiled. No, mother, says she, I shan't leave home so merrily the day\nI leave it for all--and I never saw my poor child smile again. So she\nwent, poor lamb, little thinking!--and I stood in the door looking after\nher, thinking, like a fool as I was, that my young master need not have\nthought it strange though a gentleman had taken her for a wife, for\nthere were not many ladies that looked like her.'\n\nMargaret rested her arms upon her knees, bent her head over them, made a\npause, and then began again. 'All day I was merry as a lark, singing and\nmaking every thing clean in our little habitation here, where I thought\nwe should sit down together so happy when John came home at night from\nthe castle. So it was getting darkish before my work was done, and then\nI began to wonder what was become of Jessy; and many a time I went\nacross the green to see if there was any sight of her. At last John came\nhome, and I told him that I was beginning to be frightened; but he\nlaughed at me, and said she had perhaps met with some of her comrades,\nand was gone to take her tea with them. So we sat down by the fire; but\nI could not rest, for my mind misgave me sadly; so says I, John, I will\ngo and see after my girl. Well, says he, we may as well go and meet\nher.--Alas! Alas! a sad meeting was that! We went to the door; I opened\nit, and somebody fell against me.--It was Jessy. She looked as dead as\nshe did the day I laid her in her coffin; and all her pretty cheek was\nblue, and her pretty mouth, that used to smile so sweetly in my face\nwhen she was a baby on my knee, it was all bloody. And her pretty\nshining hair that I used to comb so often--Oh woe, woe is me! How could\nI see such a sight and live.'\n\nThe mother wrung her withered hands, and sobbed as if her heart were\nbreaking. Laura laid her arms kindly round old Margaret's neck, for\nmisfortune made the poor and the stranger her equal and her friend. She\noffered no words of unavailing consolation, but pitying tears trickled\nfast down her cheeks; while Mrs Bolingbroke, her eyes flashing indignant\nfires, exclaimed, 'Surely the curse of heaven will pursue that wretch!'\n'Alas!' said Margaret, 'I fear I cursed him too; but I was in a manner\nbeside myself then. God forgive both him and me! My poor child never\ncursed him. All that I could say she would not tell who it was that had\nused her so. She said she should never bring him to justice; and always\nprayed that his own conscience might be his only punishment. So from the\nfirst we saw that her heart was quite broken; for she would never speak\nnor look up, nor let me do the smallest thing for her, but always said\nit was not fit that I should wait on such a one as she. Well, one night,\nafter we were all a-bed, a letter was flung in at the window of Jessy's\ncloset, and she crept out of her bed to take it. I can shew it you,\nMiss, for it was under her pillow when she died.' Margaret, unlocking a\ndrawer, took out a letter and gave it to Laura, who read in it these\nwords:\n\n     'My dear Jessy, I am the most miserable wretch upon earth. I\n     wish I had been upon the rack the hour I met you. I am sure I\n     have been so ever since. Do not curse me, dear Jessy! Upon my\n     soul, I had far less thought of being the ruffian I have been\n     to you, than I have at this moment of blowing out my own\n     brains. I wish to heaven that I had been in your own station\n     that I might have made you amends for the injury I have done.\n     But you know it is impossible for me to marry you. I inclose a\n     bank-bill for \u00c2\u00a3100, and I will continue to pay you the same sum\n     annually while you live, though you should never consent to see\n     me more. If you make me a father, no expence shall be spared to\n     provide the means of secrecy and comfort. No accommodation\n     which a wife could have shall be withheld from you. Tell me if\n     there be any thing more than I can do for you. I shall never\n     forgive myself for what I have done. I abhor myself, and from\n     this hour, I forswear all woman-kind for your sake. Once more,\n     dear Jessy, pardon me I implore you.'\n\nThis letter was without signature; but the hand-writing was familiar to\nLaura, and could not be mistaken. It was Hargrave's. Shuddering at this\nnew proof of his depravity, Laura inwardly offered a thanksgiving that\nshe had escaped all connection with such a monster. 'You may trust my\nfriend with the wretch's name,' said Harriet, anxious that Laura's\nconviction should be complete. 'She will make no imprudent use of it.'\n'I should never have known it myself had it not been for this letter,'\nanswered Margaret. 'But my poor child wished to answer it, and she was\nnot able to carry the answer herself, so she was obliged to ask her\nfather to go with it. And first she made us both promise on the Bible,\nnever to bring him either to shame or punishment; and then she told us\nthat it was that same Major Hargrave that used to speak her so fair.\nHere is the scroll that John took of her answer.'\n\n     'Sir, I return your money, for it can be of no use where I am\n     going. I will never curse you; but trust I shall to the last\n     have pity on you, who had no pity on me. I fear your sorrow is\n     not right repentance; for, if it was, you would never think of\n     committing a new sin by taking your own life, but rather of\n     making reparation for the great evil you have done. Not that I\n     say this in respect of wishing to be your wife. My station\n     makes that unsuitable, more especially now when I should be a\n     disgrace to any man. And I must say, a wicked person would be\n     as unsuitable among my friends; for my parents are honest\n     persons, although their daughter is so unhappy as to bring\n     shame on them. I shall not live long enough to disgrace them\n     any farther, so pray inquire no more of me, nor take the\n     trouble to send me money, for I will not buy my coffin with the\n     wages of shame; and I shall need nothing else. So, wishing that\n     my untimely end may bring you to a true repentance, I remain,\n     Sir, the poor dying disgraced,\n\n                                  'JESSY WILSON.'\n\n'Ah, Miss,' continued Margaret, wiping from the paper the drops which\nhad fallen on it, 'my poor child's prophecy was true. She always said\nshe would just live till her child was born, and then lay her\ndishonoured head and her broken heart in the grave. My Lady and Miss\nHarriet there were very kind, and my young master himself was so good as\nto promise that he would act the part of a father to the little orphan.\nAnd he used to argue with her that she should submit to the chastisement\nthat was laid upon her, and that she might find some comfort still; but\nshe always said that her chastisement was less than she deserved, but\nthat she could never wish to live to be 'a very scorn of men, an outcast\nand an alien among her mother's children.' So the day that little Henry\nwas born, she was doing so well that we were in hopes she would still be\nspared to us; but she knew better; and, when I was sitting by her, she\npulled me close to her and said, 'Mother,' says she, looking pleased\nlike, 'the time of my release is at hand now,' and then she charged me\nnever to give poor little Henry to his cruel father. I had not the power\nto say a word to her, but sat hushing the baby, with my heart like to\nbreak. So, by and by, she said to me again; but very weak and low like,\n'my brothers lie side by side in the churchyard, lay me at their feet;\nit is good enough for me.' So she never spoke more, but closed her\neyes, and slipped quietly away, and left her poor old mother.'\n\nA long paused followed Margaret's melancholy tale. 'Are you convinced,\nmy friend,' said Mrs Bolingbroke at length. 'Fully,' answered Laura, and\nreturned to silent and thankful meditation. 'My master,' said Margaret,\n'has made good his promise to poor Jessy. He has shewn a father's\nkindness to her boy. He paid for his nursing, and forces John to take a\nboard for him that might serve any gentleman's son; and now it will be\nvery hard if the end of all his goodness is to get himself ill spoken\nof; and nobody saying a word against him that was the beginning of all\nthis mischief. But that is the way of the world.' 'It is so,' said\nLaura. 'And what can better warn us that the earth was never meant for\nour resting-place. The \"raven\" wings his way through it triumphant. The\n\"dove\" finds no rest for the sole of her foot, and turns to the ark from\nwhence she came.'\n\nMrs Bolingbroke soon after took leave of her nurse, and the ladies\nproceeded in their walk towards Walbourne. Harriet continued to express\nthe warmest detestation of the profligacy of Hargrave, while Laura's\nmind was chiefly occupied in endeavouring to account for De Courcy's\ndesire to conceal from her the enormity which had just come to her\nknowledge. Unable to divine his reason, she applied to Harriet. 'Why my\ndear,' said she, 'should your brother have silenced you on a subject\nwhich could only be mentioned to his honour?' 'He never told me his\nreasons,' said Harriet smiling, 'but if you will not be angry I may try\nto guess them.' 'I think,' said Laura, 'that thus cautioned, I may\ncontrive to keep my temper; so speak boldly.' 'Then, my dear,' said\nHarriet, 'I may venture to say that I think he suspected you of a\npartiality for this wretch, and would not shock you by a full disclosure\nof his depravity. And I know,' added she, in a voice tremulous with\nemotion, 'that in him this delicacy was virtue; for the peace of his\nlife depends on securing your affectionate, your exclusive preference.'\n'Ah, Harriet, you have guessed right.--Yes! I see it all. Dear generous\nDe Courcy!' cried Laura, and burst into tears. Harriet had not time to\ncomment upon this agitation; for the next moment De Courcy himself was\nat her side. For the first time, Laura felt embarrassed and distressed\nby his presence. The words she had just uttered still sounded in her\near, and she trembled lest they had reached that of De Courcy. She was\nsafe. Her exclamation was unheard by Montague,--but he instantly\nobserved her tears, and they banished from his mind every other idea\nthan that of Laura in sorrow. He paid his compliments like one whose\nattention was distracted, and scarcely answered what his sister\naddressed to him. Mrs Bolingbroke inwardly enjoying his abstraction and\nLaura's embarrassment, determined not to spoil an opportunity which she\njudged so favourable to her brother's suit. 'This close walk,' said she\nwith a sly smile, 'was never meant for a trio. It is just fit for a pair\nof lovers. Now I have letters to write, and if you two will excuse\nme'--De Courcy colouring crimson, had not presence of mind to make any\nreply, while Laura, though burning with shame and vexation, answered\nwith her habitual self-command, 'Oh, pray my dear, use no ceremony. Here\nare none but _friends_.' The emphasis which she laid upon the last word,\nwrung a heavy sigh from De Courcy; who, while his sister was taking\nleave, was renewing his resolution not to disappoint the confidence of\nLaura.\n\nThe very circumstances which Mrs Bolingbroke had expected should lead to\na happy eclaircissement, made this interview the most reserved and\ncomfortless which the two friends had ever had. Laura was too conscious\nto talk of the story which she had just heard, and she was too full of\nit to enter easily upon any other subject. With her gratitude for the\ndelicacy which De Courcy had observed towards her, was mingled a keen\nfeeling of humiliation at the idea that he had discovered her secret\nbefore it had been confided to him; for we can sometimes confess a\nweakness which we cannot without extreme mortification see detected. Her\nsilence and depression infected De Courcy; and the few short constrained\nsentences which were spoken during their walk, formed a contrast to the\ngeneral vivacity of their conversations. Laura however recovered her\neloquence as soon as she found herself alone with Lady Pelham. With all\nthe animation of sensibility, she related the story of the ill-fated\nJessy; and disclosing in confidence the name of her destroyer, drew, in\nthe fulness of her heart, a comparison between the violator of laws\nhuman and divine, owing his life to the mercy of the wretch whom he had\nundone, and the kind adviser of inexperienced youth, the humane\nprotector of forsaken infancy. Lady Pelham quietly heard her to an end;\nand then wrinkling her eyelids, and peeping through them with her\nglittering blue eyes, she began, 'Do you know, my dear, I never met with\nprejudices so strong as yours? When will you give over looking for\nprodigies? Would any mortal but you expect a gay young man to be as\ncorrect as yourself? As for your immaculate Mr De Courcy, with his sage\nadvices, I think it is ten to one that he wanted to keep the girl for\nhimself. Besides, I'll answer for it, Hargrave would have bid farewell\nto all his indiscretions if you would have married him.' 'Never name it,\nMadam,' cried Laura warmly, 'if you would not banish me from your\npresence. His marriage with me would have been itself a crime; a crime\naggravated by being, as if in mockery, consecrated to heaven. For _my_\nconnection with such a person no name is vile enough.' 'Well, well,'\nsaid Lady Pelham, shrugging her shoulders, 'I prophesy that one day you\nwill repent having refused to share a title with the handsomest man in\nEngland.' 'All distinctions between right and wrong,' returned Laura,\n'must first be blotted from my mind. The beauty of his person is no more\nto me than the shining colours of an adder; and the rank which your\nLadyship prizes so highly, would but render me a more conspicuous mark\nfor the infamy in which his wife must share.'\n\nAwed by the lightnings of Laura's eye, Lady Pelham did not venture to\ncarry the subject farther for the present. She had of late been watching\nan opportunity of procuring the re-admission of Hargrave to the presence\nof his mistress; but this fresh discovery had served, if possible, to\nwiden the breach. Hargrave's fiery temper submitted with impatience to\nthe banishment which he had so well deserved, and he constantly urged\nLady Pelham to use her authority on his behalf. Lady Pelham, though\nconscious that this authority had no existence, was flattered by having\npower ascribed to her, and promised at some convenient season to\ninterfere. Finding herself, however, considerably embarrassed by a\npromise which she could not fulfil without hazarding the loss of Laura,\nshe was not sorry that an opportunity occurred of evading the\nperformance of her agreement. She therefore acquainted Hargrave with\nLaura's recent discovery, declaring that she could not ask her niece to\noverlook entirely so great an irregularity. From a regard to the promise\nof secrecy which she had given to Laura, as well as in common prudence,\nLady Pelham had resolved not to mention the De Courcy family as the\nfountain from which she had drawn her intelligence. Principle and\nprudence sometimes governed her Ladyship's resolutions, but seldom\nswayed her practice. In the first interview with Hargrave which followed\nthis rational determination, she was led by the mere vanity of a babbler\nto give such hints as not only enabled him to trace the story of his\nshame to Norwood, but inclined him to fix the publishing of it upon\nMontague.\n\nFrom the moment when Hargrave first unjustly suspected Laura of a\npreference for De Courcy, his heart had rankled with an enmity\nwhich a sense of its ingratitude served only to aggravate. The cool\ndisdain with which De Courcy treated him--a strong suspicion of his\nattachment,--above all, Laura's avowed esteem and regard--inflamed this\nenmity to the bitterest hatred. Hopeless as he was of succeeding in his\ndesigns by any fair or honourable means, he might have entertained\nthoughts of relinquishing his suit; and of seeking, in a match of\ninterest, the means of escape from his embarrassments: but that Laura,\nwith all her unequalled charms, should be the prize of De Courcy, that\nin her he should obtain all that beauty, affluence, and love could give,\nwas a thought not to be endured. Lady Pelham, too, more skilled to\npractise on the passions of others than to command her own, was\nconstantly exciting him, by hints of De Courcy's progress in the favour\nof Laura; while Lambert, weary of waiting for the tedious accomplishment\nof his own scheme, continually goaded him, with sly sarcasms on his\nfailure in the arts of persuasion, and on his patience in submitting to\nbe baffled in his wishes by a haughty girl. In the heat of his\nirritation, Hargrave often swore that no power on earth should long\ndelay the gratification of his love and his revenge. But to marry a\nfree-born British woman against her consent, is, in these enlightened\ntimes, an affair of some difficulty; and Hargrave, in his cooler\nmoments, perceived that the object of three years eager pursuit was\nfarther than ever from his attainment.\n\nFortune seemed in every respect to oppose the fulfilment of his designs,\nfor his regiment at this time received orders to prepare to embark for\nAmerica; and Lord Lincourt, who had discovered his nephew's ruinous\nconnection with Lambert, had influence to procure, from high authority,\na hint that Hargrave would be expected to attend his duty on the other\nside of the Atlantic.\n\nThe news of this arrangement Hargrave immediately conveyed to Lady\nPelham, urging her to sanction any means which could be devised for\nmaking Laura the companion of his voyage. Lady Pelham hesitated to carry\nher complaisance so far; but she resolved to make the utmost use of the\ntime which intervened to promote the designs of her favourite. Her\nLadyship was not at any time much addicted to the communication of\npleasurable intelligence, and the benevolence of her temper was not\naugmented by a prospect of the defeat of a plan in which her vanity was\nso much interested. She therefore maliciously withheld from her niece a\npiece of information so likely to be heard with joy. It reached Laura,\nhowever, by means of one who was ever watchful for her gratification. De\nCourcy no sooner ascertained the truth of the report, than he hastened\nto convey it to Laura.\n\nHe found her alone, and was welcomed with all her accustomed cordiality.\n'I am sorry,' said he, with a smile which contradicted his words, 'I am\nsorry to be the bearer of bad news to you; but I could not deny myself\nthe edification of witnessing your fortitude--Do you know that you are\non the point of losing the most assiduous admirer that ever woman was\nblessed with? In three weeks Colonel Hargrave embarks for America. Nay,\ndo not look incredulous. I assure you it is true.' 'Thank Heaven,' cried\nLaura, 'I shall once more be in peace and safety!' 'Oh, fie! Is this\nyour regret for so ardent a lover? Have you no feeling?' 'Just such a\nfeeling as the poor man had when he escaped from beneath the sword that\nhung by a hair. Indeed, Mr De Courcy, I cannot tell you to what a degree\nhe has embittered the two last years of my life. But I believe,'\ncontinued she, blushing very deeply, 'I need not explain to you any of\nmy feelings towards Colonel Hargrave, since I find you have I know not\nwhat strange faculty of divining them.' Assisted by a conversation which\nhe had had with his sister, De Courcy easily understood Laura's meaning.\nRespectfully taking her hand, 'Pardon me,' said he, in a low voice, 'if\nI have ever ventured to guess what it was your wish to conceal from me.'\n'Oh, believe me,' cried Laura, with a countenance and manner of mingled\ncandour and modesty, 'there is not a thought of my heart that I wish to\nconceal from you; since from you, even my most humbling weaknesses are\nsure of meeting with delicacy and indulgence. But since you are so good\nan augur,' added she, with an ingenuous smile, 'I trust you perceive\nthat I shall need no more delicacy or indulgence upon the same score.'\nThe fascinating sweetness of her looks and voice, for the first time\nbeguiled De Courcy of his promised caution. 'Dear, dear Laura,' he\ncried, fondly pressing her hand to his breast, 'it is I who have need of\nindulgence, and I must--I must sue for it. I must repeat to you that--'\nLaura's heart sprung to her lips, and unconsciously snatching away her\nhand, she stood in breathless expectation of what was to follow.\n'Madman, that I am!' cried De Courcy, recalled to recollection by her\ngesture,--'whither am I venturing!' That was precisely what of all\nthings Laura was most desirous to know; and she remained with her eyes\nfixed on the ground, half dreading the confidence, half the timidity of\nher lover. A momentary glance at the speaking countenance of Laura,\nglowing with confusion, yet brightened with trembling pleasure, awakened\nthe strongest hopes that ever had warmed De Courcy's bosom. 'Beloved\nLaura,' said he, again tenderly approaching her, 'remember I am but\nhuman. Cease to treat me with this beguiling confidence. Cease to\nbewitch me with these smiles, which are so like all that I wish, or\nsuffer me to--' Laura started, as her attention was drawn by some one\npassing close to the ground window near which they were standing. 'Ah!'\ncried she, in a tone of vexation, 'there is my evil genius. Colonel\nHargrave is come into the house. He will be here this instant. Excuse me\nfor driving you away. I beseech you do not remain a moment alone with\nhim.'\n\nLaura was not mistaken. She had scarcely spoken, ere, with a dark cloud\non his brow, Hargrave entered. He bowed to Laura, who was advancing\ntowards the door. 'I am afraid, Madam, I interrupt you,' said he,\ndarting a ferocious scowl upon De Courcy. Laura, without deigning even a\nsingle glance in reply, left the room. Hargrave, as he passed the\nwindow, had observed the significant attitude of the lovers; and his\njealousy and rage were inflamed to the uttermost by the scorn which he\nhad endured in the presence of his rival. Fiercely stalking up to De\nCourcy, 'Is it to you, Sir,' said he, 'that I am indebted for this\ninsolence?' 'No Sir,' answered De Courcy, a little disdainfully. 'I have\nnot the honour of regulating Miss Montreville's civilities.' 'This is a\npaltry evasion,' cried Hargrave. 'Is it not to your misrepresentations\nof a youthful indiscretion that I owe Miss Montreville's present\ndispleasure?' 'I am not particularly ambitious of the character of an\ninformer,' answered De Courcy; and taking his hat wished Hargrave a\nstately good morning. 'Stay, Sir!' cried Hargrave, roughly seizing him\nby the arm. 'I must have some further conversation with you--You don't\ngo yet.' 'I am not disposed to ask your permission,' returned De Courcy;\nand coolly liberating his arm, walked out of the house. Boiling with\nrage, Hargrave followed him. 'It is easy to see, Sir,' said he, 'from\nwhence you borrow a spirit that never was natural to you--Your\npresumption builds upon the partiality of that fickle capricious woman.\nBut observe, Sir, that I have claims on her; claims which she herself\nwas too happy in allowing; and no man shall dare to interfere with\nthem.' 'I shall dare,' returned De Courcy, anger kindling in his eyes,\n'to inquire by what right you employ such expressions in regard to Miss\nMontreville; and whether my spirit be my own or not, you shall find it\nsufficient to prevent your holding such language in my presence.' 'In\nyour presence, or the presence of all the devils,' cried De Courcy, 'I\nwill maintain my right; and, if you fancy that it interferes with any\nclaim of yours, you know how to obtain satisfaction. There is but one\nway to decide the business.' 'I am of your opinion,' replied De Courcy,\n'that there is one way, provided that we can mutually agree to bide by\nit; and that is, an appeal to Miss Montreville herself.' Hargrave turned\npale, and his lip quivered with rage. 'A mode of decision, no doubt,'\nsaid he, 'which your vanity persuades you will be all in your favour!\nNo, no, Sir, our quarrel must be settled by means in which even your\nconceit cannot deny my equality.' 'By a brace of pistols, you mean of\ncourse,' said De Courcy, coolly; 'but I frankly tell you. Colonel\nHargrave, that my notions must have changed before I can find the\nsatisfaction of a gentleman in being murdered; and my principles, before\nI shall seek it in murdering you.' 'Curse on your hypocrisy!' cried\nHargrave. 'Keep this canting to cozen girls, and let me avenge my wrongs\nlike a man, or the world shall know you, Sir.' 'Do you imagine,' said De\nCourcy, with a smile of calm disdain, 'that I am to be terrified into\ndoing what I tell you I think wrong, by the danger of a little\nmisrepresentation? You may, if you think fit, tell the world that I will\nnot stake my life in a foolish quarrel, nor wilfully send an unrepenting\nsinner to his great account; and, if you go on to ascribe for my\nforbearance any motive which is derogatory to my character, I may, if\n_I_ think fit, obtain justice as a peacable citizen ought; or I may\nleave you undisturbed the glory of propagating a slander which even you\nyourself believe to be groundless.'\n\nDe Courcy's coolness served only to exasperate his adversary. 'Truce\nwith this methodistical jargon!' cried he fiercely. 'It may impose upon\nwomen, but I see through it, Sir--see that it is but a miserable trick\nto escape what you dare not meet.' 'Dare not!' cried De Courcy,\nlightnings flashing from his eye. 'My nerves have failed me, then,\nsince'--He stopped abruptly, for he scorned at such a moment to remind\nhis antagonist of the courageous effort to which he owed his life.\n'Since when!' cried Hargrave, more and more enraged, as the recollection\nwhich De Courcy had recalled, placed before him the full turpitude of\nhis conduct.--'Do you think I owe you thanks for a life which you have\nmade a curse to me, by cheating me of its dearest pleasures. But may\ntortures be my portion if I do not foil you!'\n\nThe latter part of this dialogue was carried on in a close shady lane\nwhich branched off from the avenue of Walbourne. The dispute was\nproceeding with increasing warmth on both sides when it was interrupted\nby the appearance of Laura. From a window she had observed the gentlemen\nleave the house together; had watched Hargrave's angry gestures, and\nseen De Courcy accompany him into the by-path. The evil which she had so\nlong dreaded seemed now on the point of completion; and alarm leaving no\nroom for reserve, she followed them with her utmost speed.\n\n'Oh, Mr De Courcy,' she cried, with a look and attitude of most earnest\nsupplication, 'for mercy leave this madman!--If you would not make me\nfor ever miserable, carry this no further--I entreat--I implore you.\nFear for me, if you fear not for yourself.' The tender solicitude for\nthe safety of his rival, which Hargrave imagined her words and gestures\nto express, the triumphant delight which they called up to the eyes of\nDe Courcy, exasperated Hargrave beyond all bounds of self-command.\nFrantic with jealousy and rage, he drew, and rushed fiercely on De\nCourcy; but Montague having neither fear nor anger to disturb his\npresence of mind, parried the thrust with his cane, closed with his\nadversary before he could recover, wrested the weapon from his hand; and\nhaving calmly ascertained that no person could be injured by its fall,\nthrew it over the fence into the adjoining field. Then taking Hargrave\naside, he whispered that he would immediately return to him; and, giving\nhis arm to Laura, led her towards the house.\n\nShe trembled violently, and big tears rolled down her colourless cheeks,\nas, vainly struggling with her emotion, she said, 'Surely you will not\nendanger a life so precious, so'--She was unable to proceed; but, laying\nher hand on De Courcy's arm, she raised her eyes to his face, with such\na look of piteous appeal as reached his very soul. Enchanted to find his\nsafety the object of such tender interest, he again forgot his caution;\nand, fondly supporting with his arm the form which seemed almost sinking\nto the earth, 'What danger would I not undergo,' he cried, 'to purchase\nsuch concern as this! Be under no alarm, dear Miss Montreville. Even if\nmy sentiments in regard to duelling were other than they are, no\nprovocation should tempt me to implicate your revered name in a quarrel\nwhich would, from its very nature, become public.' Somewhat\ntranquillized by his words, Laura walked silently by his side till they\nreached the house, when, in a cheerful tone, he bade her farewell. 'A\nshort farewell,' said he, 'for I must see you again this evening.'\nLaura could scarcely prevail on herself to part from him. 'May I trust\nyou?' said she, with a look of anxiety that spoke volumes. 'Securely,\ndearest Laura,' answered he. 'He whom you trust needs no other motive\nfor rectitude.' He then hastened from her into the field, whither he had\nthrown Hargrave's sword; and having found it, sprung over into the lane\nwhere he had left its owner. Gracefully presenting it to him, De Courcy\nbegged pardon for having deprived him of it, 'though,' added he, 'I\nbelieve you are now rather disposed to thank me for preventing the\neffects of a momentary irritation.' Hargrave took his sword, and, in\nsurly silence walked on; then, suddenly stopping, he repeated that there\nwas only one way in which the quarrel could be decided; and asked De\nCourcy whether he was determined to refuse him satisfaction. 'The only\nsatisfaction,' returned De Courcy, 'which is consistent with my notions\nof right and wrong, I will give you now, on the spot. It is not to my\ninformation that you owe Miss Montreville's displeasure. Circumstances,\nwhich I own were wholly foreign to any consideration of your interests,\ninduced me to keep your secret almost as if it had been my own; and it\nis from others that she has learnt a part of your conduct, which, you\nmust give me leave to say, warrants, even on the ground of modern\nhonour, my refusal to treat you as an equal.' 'Insolent!' cried\nHargrave, 'Leave me--avoid me, if you would not again provoke me to\nchastise you, unarmed as you are.' 'My horses wait for me at the gate,'\nsaid De Courcy, coolly proceeding by his side, 'and your way seems to\nlie in the same direction as mine.'\n\nThe remainder of the way was passed in silence. At the gate, De Courcy\nmounting his horse, bid his rival good morning, which the other returned\nwith an ungracious bow. De Courcy rode home, and Hargrave, finding\nhimself master of the field, returned to Walbourne. There he exerted his\nutmost influence with Lady Pelham to procure an opportunity of excusing\nhimself to Laura. Lady Pelham confessed that she could not venture to\ntake the tone of command, lest she should drive Laura to seek shelter\nelsewhere; but she promised to contrive an occasion for an interview\nwhich he might prolong at his pleasure, provided such a one could be\nfound without her apparent interference. With this promise he was\nobliged for the present to content himself, for, during his stay, Laura\ndid not appear. She passed the day in disquiet. She could not rest. She\ncould not employ herself. She dreaded lest the interview of the morning\nshould have been only preparatory to one of more serious consequence.\nShe told herself a hundred times that she was sure of De Courcy's\nprinciples; and yet feared as if they had been unworthy of confidence.\nHe had promised to see her in the evening, and she anxiously expected\nthe performance of his promise. She knew that if he came while Lady\nPelham was in the way, her Ladyship would be too vigilant a guard to let\none confidential word be exchanged. She therefore, with a\nhalf-pardonable cunning, said not a word of De Courcy's promised visit;\nand as soon as her aunt betook herself to her afternoon's nap, stole\nfrom the drawing-room to receive him. Yet perhaps she never met him with\nless semblance of cordiality. She blushed and stammered while she\nexpressed her hopes that the morning's dispute was to have no further\nconsequences, and apologized for the interest she took in it, in\nlanguage more cold than she would have used to a mere stranger. Scarcely\ncould the expression of tenderness have delighted the lover like this\nlittle ill-concealed affectation, the first and the last which he ever\nwitnessed in Laura Montreville. 'Ah, dearest Laura,' cried he, 'it is\ntoo late to retract--You have said that my safety was dear to you; owned\nthat it was for _me_ you feared this morning, and you shall not cancel\nyour confession.' Laura's colour deepened to crimson, but she made no\nother reply. Then, with a more timid voice and air, De Courcy said, 'I\nwould have told you _then_ what dear presumptuous hopes your anxiety\nawakened, but that I feared to extort from your agitation what perhaps a\ncooler moment might refuse me. My long-loved, ever dear Laura, will you\npardon me these hopes? Will you not speak to me?--Not one little word to\ntell me that I am not too daring.' Laura spoke not even that little\nword. She made a faint struggle to withdraw the hand which De Courcy\npressed. Yet the lover read the expressions of her half-averted face,\nand was satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\n'Pray,' said Lady Pelham to her niece, 'what might you and your paragon\nbe engaged in for the hour and a half you were together this evening?'\n\n'We were discussing a very important subject, Madam,' answered Laura,\nmustering all her confidence.\n\n'May I be permitted to inquire into the nature of it?' returned Lady\nPelham, covering her spleen with a thin disguise of ceremony.\n\n'Certainly, Madam,' replied Laura. 'You may remember I once told you\nthat if ever I received addresses which I could with honour reveal, I\nshould bespeak your Ladyship's patience for my tale. Mr De Courcy was\ntalking of marriage, Madam; and--and I--'\n\n'Oh, mighty well, Miss Montreville,' cried Lady Pelham, swelling with\nrage, 'I comprehend you perfectly. You may spare your modesty. Keep all\nthese airs and blushes till you tell Colonel Hargrave, that all your\nfine high-flown passion for him has been quite at the service of the\nnext man you met with!'\n\nLaura's eyes filled with tears of mortification, yet she meekly\nanswered, 'I am conscious that the degrading attachment of which I was\nonce the sport merits your upbraidings; and indeed they have not been\nits least punishment.' She paused for a moment, and then added with an\ninsinuating smile. 'I can bear that you should reproach me with my new\nchoice, for inconstancy is the prescriptive right of woman, and nothing\nelse can be objected to my present views.'\n\n'Oh, far be it from me!' cried Lady Pelham, scorn and anger throwing her\nwhole little person into active motion, 'far be it from me to make any\nobjection to your immaculate swain! I would have you understand,\nhowever, that no part of my property shall go to enrich a parcel of\nproud beggars. It was indeed my intention, if you had made a proper\nmatch, to give you the little all that I have to bestow; but if you\nprefer starving with your methodist parson to being the heiress of\nfive-and-forty thousand pounds, I have no more to say. However, you had\nbetter keep your own secret. The knowledge of it might probably alter Mr\nDe Courcy's plans a little.'\n\n'Your Ladyship,' answered Laura, with spirit, 'has good access to know\nthat the love of wealth has little influence on my purposes; and I\nassure you that Mr De Courcy would scorn upon any terms to appropriate\nwhat he considers as the unalienable right of your own child. Though we\nshall not be affluent, we shall be too rich for your charity, and that\nis the only claim in which I could compete with Mrs Herbert.'\n\nThis mention of her daughter exasperated Lady Pelham to fury. In a voice\nhalf-choked with passion, she cried, 'Neither that rebellious wretch nor\nany of her abbettors or imitators shall ever have countenance or\nassistance from me. No! Not though they should beg with their starved\nbantlings from door to door.' To this intemperate speech Laura made no\nreply, but quietly began to pour out the tea. Lady Pelham continued to\nhurry up and down the room, chafing, and venting her rage in common\nabuse; for a scold in the drawing-room is not very unlike a scold at a\ngreen-stall. The storm meeting with no opposition, at length spent\nitself; or subsided into short growlings, uttered at the intervals of a\nsurly silence. To these, as no answer was absolutely necessary, none was\nreturned. Laura did not utter a syllable, till Lady Pelham's wrath\nbeginning to give place to her curiosity, she turned to her niece,\nsaying, 'Pray, Miss Montreville, when and where is this same wise\nmarriage of yours to take place?'\n\n'The time is not quite fixed, Madam,' answered Laura. 'As soon as you\ncan conveniently spare me, I intend going to Scotland; and when you, and\nMrs De Courcy wish me to return, Mr De Courcy will escort me back.'\n\n'I spare you!' returned Lady Pelham with a sneer--'Oh, Ma'am, if that is\nall, pray don't let me retard your raptures. You may go tomorrow, or\nto-night, Ma'am if you please.--Spare you indeed! Truly while I can\nafford to pay a domestic, I need not be dependent on your assistance;\nand in attachment or gratitude any common servant may supply your\nplace.'\n\nThe rudeness and ingratitude of this speech again forced the tears to\nLaura's eyes; but she mildly replied, 'Well, Madam, as soon as you find\na substitute for me, I shall be ready to depart.' Then to escape\nfurther insult she quitted the room.\n\nLady Pelham's wrath at the derangement of her plan would not suffer her\nto rest till she had communicated the disaster to Colonel Hargrave.\nEarly next morning, accordingly, she dispatched a note requiring his\nimmediate presence at Walbourne. He obeyed the summons, and was as usual\nprivately received by Lady Pelham. He listened to her intelligence with\ntransports of rage rather than of sorrow. He loaded his rival with\nexecrations, declaring that he would rather see Laura torn in pieces\nthan know her to be the wife of De Courcy. He swore that he would\ncircumvent their schemes, and that though his life should be the\nforfeit, he would severely revenge the sufferings he had endured.\n\nLady Pelham had not courage to encounter the evil spirit which she had\nraised. Subdued, and crouching before his violence, she continued to\ngive a terrified assent to every extravagance he uttered, till he\nannounced his resolution of seeing Laura on the instant, that he might\nknow whether she dared to confirm this odious tale. Lady Pelham then\nventured to represent to him that Laura might be so much offended by\nthis breach of contract, as to take refuge with Mrs De Courcy, a measure\nwhich would oppose a new obstacle to any scheme for breaking off the\nintended marriage. She assured him that she would grant every reasonable\nassistance in preventing a connection so injurious to her niece's\ninterest, though she knew Laura's obstinacy of temper too well to hope\nany thing from direct resistance. She hinted that it would be most\nprudent to give the desired interview the appearance of accident, and\nshe promised to contrive the occasion as soon as Hargrave was\nsufficiently calm to consider of improving it to best advantage.\n\nBut calm was a stranger to the breast of Hargrave. The disquiet which is\nthe appointed portion of the wicked, raged there beyond control. To the\nanguish of disappointment were added the pangs of jealousy, and the\nheart-burnings of hatred and revenge. Even the loss of the object of\nthree years eager pursuit was less cutting than the success of De\nCourcy; and the pain of a forfeiture which was the just punishment of a\nformer crime, was heightened to agony by the workings of such passions\nas consummate the misery of fiends.\n\nThe associates of the wicked must forego the consolations of honest\nsympathy. All Hargrave's tortures were aggravated by the sarcasms of\nLambert; who, willing to hasten the fever to its crisis, goaded him with\ncoarse comments upon the good fortune of his rival, and advices (which\nhe well knew would act in a direction opposite to their seeming purpose)\nto desist from further competition. After spending four-and-twenty hours\nin alternate fits of rage and despair, Hargrave returned to Lady Pelham,\ninforming her, that whatever were the consequences, he would no longer\ndelay seeing Laura. Lady Pelham had foreseen this demand; and though not\nwithout fear of the event, had prepared for compliance. She had already\narranged her scheme, and the execution was easy.\n\nLaura's favourite walk in the shrubbery led to a little summer-house,\nconcealed in a thicket of acacias. Thither Lady Pelham had conveyed some\ndried plants, and had requested Laura's assistance in classing them.\nLaura had readily agreed, and that very morning had been allotted for\nthe task. Lady Pelham, having first directed Hargrave where to take his\nstation, accompanied her unsuspecting niece to the summer-house, and\nthere for a while joined in her employment. Soon, however, feigning a\npretext for half an hour's absence, she quitted Laura, intending at\nfirst to loiter in the shrubbery, as a kind of safeguard against the ill\nconsequences of her imprudent connivance; but meeting with a gardener\nwho was going to transplant a bed of favourite auriculas, she followed\nhim to watch over their safety, leaving her niece to guard her own.\n\nScarcely had Laura been a minute alone, ere she was startled by the\nentrance of Hargrave, and seriously alarmed by seeing him lock the door,\nand deliberately secure the key. 'What is it you mean, Sir?' said she,\ntrembling.\n\n'To decide your fate and mine!' answered Hargrave, with a look and voice\nthat struck terror to her soul. 'I am told you are a bride, Laura,' said\nhe, speaking through his clenched teeth. 'Say,' continued he, firmly\ngrasping her arm. 'Speak! is it so?'\n\n'I know no right,' said Laura, recovering herself, 'that you have to\nquestion me--nor meanly thus to steal--'\n\n'No evasions!' interrupted Hargrave, in a voice of thunder. 'I have\nrights--rights which I will maintain while I have being. Now tell me, if\nyou dare, that you have transferred them to that abhorred--'\n\nHe stopped,--his utterance choked by the frenzy into which he had worked\nhimself. 'What has transported you to this fury, Colonel Hargrave?' said\nLaura, calmly. 'Surely you must be sensible, that whatever claims I\nmight once have allowed you, have long since been made void by your own\nconduct. I will not talk to you of principle, though that were of itself\nsufficient to sever us forever; but ask yourself what right you can\nretain over the woman whom you have insulted, and forsaken, and\noppressed, and outraged?'\n\n'Spare your taunts, Laura. They will only embitter the hour of\nretribution. And may hell be my portion, if I be not richly repaid for\nall the scorn you have heaped upon me. I will be revenged, proud woman.\nYou shall be at my mercy, where no cool canting villain can wrest you\nfrom me!'\n\nHis threats, and the frightful violence with which they were uttered,\nfilled Laura with mingled dread and pity. 'Command yourself, I beseech\nyou, Colonel Hargrave,' said she. 'If you resent the pain which, believe\nme, I have most unwillingly occasioned, you are amply revenged. You have\nalready caused me sufferings which mock description.'\n\n'Yes, yes. I know it,' cried Hargrave in a milder voice. 'You were not\nthen so hard. You could feel when that vile wanton first seduced me from\nyou. Then think what I now endure, when this cold-blooded--but may I\nperish if I do not snatch his prize from him. And think not of\nresistance, Laura; for, by all that I have suffered, resistance shall be\nvain.'\n\n'Why do you talk so dreadfully to me?' said Laura, making a trembling\neffort to release her arm, which he still firmly grasped. 'Why, why will\nyou not cease to persecute me? I have never injured you. I have\nforgiven, pitied, prayed for you. How have I deserved this worse than\nsavage cruelty?'\n\n'Laura,' said Hargrave, moved by the pleadings of a voice which would\nhave touched a murderer's heart, 'you have still a choice. Promise to be\nmine. Permit me only, by slow degrees, to regain what I have lost. Say\nthat months--that years hence you will consent, and you are safe.'\n\n'Impossible!' said Laura. 'I cannot bind myself. Nor could you trust a\npromise extorted by fear. Yet be but half what I once thought you, and I\nwill esteem--'\n\n'Esteem!' interrupted Hargrave, with a ghastly smile. 'Yes! And shrink\nfrom me, as you do now, while you hang on that detested wretch till even\nhis frozen heart warm to passion. No!' continued he, with an awful\nadjuration, 'though the deed bring me to the scaffold, you shall be\nmine. You shall be my wife, too, Laura,--but not till you have besought\nme--sued at my feet for the title you have so often despised. I will be\nmaster of your fate, of that reputation, that virtue which you\nworship--and your minion shall know it, that he may writhe under\njealousy and disappointment.'\n\n'Powers of Mercy!' cried Laura, raising her eyes in strong compunction,\n'have I made this mine idol!' Then, turning on Hargrave a look of deep\nrepentance, 'Yes,' she continued, 'I deserve to see thee as thou art,\nwithout mitigation vile; since on thee my sacrilegious heart bestowed\nsuch love as was due to the Infinite alone!'\n\n'Oh, Laura,' cried Hargrave, softened by the remembrance of her youthful\naffection, 'let but one faint spark of that love revive, and I will\nforget all your scorns, and feel again such gentle wishes as blest our\nfirst hours of tenderness. Or only swear that you will renounce that\nbane of my existence--that you will shrink from him, shun him like a\nserpent!--Or give me your word only, and I will trust it. Your liberty,\nyour person, shall be as sacred as those of angels. Promise them--'\n\n'Why do you attempt to terrify me?' said Laura, her indignation rising\nas her alarm subsided. 'I have perhaps no longer the right--even if I\nhad the inclination--to utter such a vow. I trust that, in this land of\nfreedom, I am safe from your violence. My reputation, frail as it is,\nyou cannot harm without permission from on high; and if, for wise\npurposes, the permission be given, I doubt not that I shall be enabled\nto bear unjust reproach,--nay, even to profit by the wrong.'\n\nHargrave suffered her to conclude; rage bereft him, for a time, of the\npower of utterance. Then, bursting into a torrent of reproach, he\nupbraided her in language the most insulting. 'Do you dare to own,' said\nhe, 'that your base inclinations favour that abhorred--that this\naccursed marriage is your choice--your free choice?' He paused in vain\nfor a reply. Laura would not irritate him further, and scorned to\ndisguise the truth. 'Then, Laura,' said he, and he confirmed the\nsentence with a dreadful oath, 'you have sealed your fate. Think you\nthat your De Courcy shall foil me? By Heaven, I will see you perish\nfirst. I will tear you from him, though I answer it with my life and\nsoul. Let this be the pledge of my triumph'--and he made a motion to\nclasp her rudely in his arms. With a cry of dread and horror, Laura\nsprung from him, and, throwing open the casement, called loudly for\nassistance. Hargrave forced her back. 'Spare your alarms, my lovely\nproud one,' said he, with a smile, which made her blood run cold. 'You\nare safe till we meet where cries will be useless. What! may I not even\nkiss this pretty hand, as earnest that you shall soon be mine beyond the\npower of fate?' 'Silence, audacious!' cried Laura, bursting into tears\nof mingled fear and indignation, while she struggled violently to\ndisengage her hands. 'Nay, this rosy cheek will content me better,'\ncried Hargrave, and was again attempting to clasp her--when the door was\nburst suddenly open, and De Courcy appeared.\n\n'Ruffian!' he exclaimed, approaching Hargrave, who, in his surprise,\npermitted his prey to escape. Her fears now taking a new direction,\nLaura flew to intercept De Courcy. 'Ah!' she cried, 'my folly has done\nthis. Fly from this madman, I entreat you. I have nothing to fear but\nfor you. Begone, I implore you.'\n\n'And leave you to such treatment! Not while I have life! When you choose\nto go, I will attend you. For you, Sir!--But I must stoop below the\nlanguage of a gentleman ere I find words to describe your conduct.'\n\n'For Heaven's sake,' cried Laura, 'dear De Courcy, provoke him no\nfurther. Let us fly this place;' and clinging to De Courcy's arm, she\ndrew him on; while, with the other, he defended her from Hargrave, who\nhad advanced to detain her. Her expression of regard, her confiding\nattitude, exasperated the frenzy of Hargrave to the uttermost. Almost\nunconscious of his actions, he drew a pistol from his pocket and fired.\nLaura uttered a cry of terror, clasping her lover's arm more closely to\nher breast. 'Be not alarmed love,' whispered De Courcy. 'It is\nnothing!'--and staggering forward a few paces, he fell to the ground.\n\nLaura, in desperation rushed from the summer-house, calling wildly for\nhelp; then struck with the fearful thought that Hargrave might complete\nhis bloody work, she hastened back. During the few moments of her\nabsence, De Courcy addressed his murderer, whose rage had given place to\na mild stupor. 'I fear this is an unlucky stroke, Hargrave. Save\nyourself. My horse is at the gate.' Hargrave answered only with a groan;\nand, striking his clenched hand on his forehead, turned away. His crime\nwas unpremeditated. No train of self-deceit had reconciled his\nconscience to its atrocity. The remembrance of the courage which had\nsaved his life; the generous concern of De Courcy for his safety;\nhumility, the last virtue which utterly forsakes us, all awakened him to\nremorse, keen and overwhelming, like every other passion of Hargrave.\nNot bearing to look upon his victim, he stood fixed and motionless;\nwhile Laura, on her knees, watched, in dismay, the changing countenance\nof De Courcy, and strove to staunch the blood which was streaming from\nhis wound.\n\nDe Courcy once more tried to cheer Laura with words of comfort. 'Were\nit not,' said he, 'for the pleasure this kind concern gives me, I might\ntell you that I do not suffer much pain. I am sure I could rise, if I\ncould trust this slender arm,' laying his hand gently upon it. Laura\neagerly offered her assistance as he attempted to raise himself; but the\neffort overpowered him, and he sunk back fainting.\n\nIn the strong language of terror, Laura besought Hargrave to procure\nhelp. Still motionless, his forehead resting against the wall, his hands\nclenched as in convulsion, Hargrave seemed not to heed her entreaties.\n'Have you no mercy?' cried she, clasping the arm from which she had so\nlately shrunk in horror. 'He saved your life. Will you let him perish\nwithout aid?' 'Off, woman!' cried Hargrave, throwing her from him. 'Thy\nwitchcraft has undone me;' and he distractedly hurried away.\n\nLaura's terror was not the passive cowardice of a feeble mind. She was\nleft alone to judge, to act, for herself--for more than herself.\nImmediate, momentous decision was necessary. And she did decide by an\neffort of which no mind enfeebled by sloth or selfishness would have\nbeen capable. She saw that loss of blood was the cause of De Courcy's\nimmediate danger, a danger which might be irremediable before he could\nreceive assistance from more skilful hands than her's. Such remedy,\nthen, as she could command she hastened to apply.\n\nTo the plants which their beauty had recommended to Lady Pelham, Laura\nhad added a few of which the usefulness was known to her. Agaric of the\noak was of the number, and she had often applied it where many a hand\nless fair would have shrunk from the task. Nor did she hesitate now. The\nball had entered near the neck; and the feminine, the delicate Laura\nherself disengaged the wound from its coverings; the feeling, the tender\nLaura herself performed an office from which false sensibility would\nhave recoiled in horror.\n\nShe was thus employed when she was found by a woman whom Hargrave had\nmet and sent to her assistance, with an indistinct message, from which\nLaura gathered that he was gone in search of a surgeon. The woman no\nsooner cast her eyes on the bloody form of De Courcy, and on the\ncolourless face of Laura, more death-like than his, than, with noisy\nimbecility, she began to bewail and ejaculate. Laura, however, instantly\nput a stop to her exclamations by dispatching her for cordials and\nassistance. In a few minutes all the household was assembled round De\nCourcy; yet such was the general curiosity, horror, or astonishment,\nthat he would have remained unaided but for the firmness of her who was\nmost interested in the scene. She dismissed every one whose presence\nwas unnecessary, and silenced the rest by peremptory command. She\nadministered a cordial to recruit the failing strength of De Courcy; and\ncausing him to be raised to the posture which seemed the least painful,\nmade her own trembling arms his support.\n\nNothing further now remained to be done, and Laura began to feel the\nfull horrors of her situation; to weigh the fearful probability that all\nher cares were vain; to upbraid herself as the cause of this dire\ntragedy. Her anguish was too great to find relief in tears. Pale and\ncold as marble, chilly drops bursting from her forehead, she sat in the\nstillness of him who waits the sentence of condemnation, save when a\nconvulsive shudder expressed her suffering.\n\nThe mournful quiet was interrupted by the entrance of Lady Pelham, who,\nquite out of breath, began a string of questions, mixed with abundance\nof ejaculation. 'Bless my soul!' she cried, 'how has all this happened?\nFor heaven's sake, Laura, tell me the meaning of all this. Why don't you\nspeak, girl? Good Lord! could you not have prevented these madmen from\nquarrelling? What brought De Courcy here? How did he find you out? Why\ndon't you speak. Mercy on me! Is the girl out of her senses?'\n\nThe expression of deep distress with which Laura now raised her eyes,\nreminded Lady Pelham of the sensibility requisite upon such an occasion,\nwhich her Ladyship's curiosity had hitherto driven from her\nrecollection. Approaching, therefore, to De Courcy, she took a hasty\nlook at this dismal spectacle; and exclaiming, 'Oh what a sight is here!\nUnfortunate Laura! Dear wretched girl!' she began first to sob, and then\nto scream violently. Laura motioned to the attendants to lead her away;\nand she suffered them to do so without resistance; but she had no sooner\ncrossed the threshold, than, perceiving the spectators whom curiosity\nhad collected in the shrubbery, she redoubled her shrieks, struggled,\nbeat herself; and, but for the untoward strength of her nerves, would\nhave soon converted her pretended fit into reality. Wearied with her\nefforts, she was beginning to relax them, when the surgeon appeared, and\nher Ladyship was more vociferous than ever. Mr Raby, a quiet sensible\nman, undertook her care before he proceeded to his more serious\nbusiness; and, either guided by his previous acquaintance with his\npatient, or by his experience in similar cases, gave a prescription\nwhich, though simple was perfectly efficacious. He directed that the\nlady should be instantly secluded in her own chamber, with only one\nattendant; and the remedy proved so beneficial, that her Ladyship\nenjoyed a night of tranquil repose.\n\nHe next turned his attention to De Courcy; and judging it proper to\nextract the ball without delay, advised Laura to retire. Without\nopposition she prepared to obey; and, seeing De Courcy about to speak,\nput her hand on his lips to save him the exertion, and herself the pain\nof a farewell. Yet, as she resigned her charge, raising her eyes to\nheaven, once more to commend De Courcy to the divine protection, the\nfervour of her supplication burst into words. 'Oh if it be possible! if\nit be possible!'--she cried. 'Yes it is possible,' said De Courcy,\ncomprehending the unfinished sentence. 'Your firmness, noble creature,\nhas made it possible.' Reproaching herself with having allowed De Courcy\nto perceive her alarm, she hastened away; and seating herself on the\nsteps that led to the door, awaited in silence the event of the\noperation.\n\nHere, as she sorrowfully called to mind the various excellencies of De\nCourcy, his piety, his integrity, his domestic virtues, so lately known,\nso soon to be lost to her, she suddenly recollected the heavier calamity\nof the mother deprived of such a son, and perceived the inhumanity of\npermitting the stroke to fall without preparation. Having access to no\nmessenger more tender than a common servant, she determined, though with\nunspeakable reluctance, herself to bear the tidings to Mrs De Courcy. 'I\nwill know the worst,' thought she, 'and then'--\n\nShe started at a faint noise that sounded from the summer-house. Steps\napproached the door from within. She sprung up, and the surgeon\nappeared. 'I have the happiness to tell you,' said he, 'that, if no\nfever take place, our friend is safe. The chief danger has been from\nloss of blood; and your presence of mind--Ah!--Do you feel faint?'--\n\nThe awful interest which had supported the spirits of Laura thus\nsuddenly withdrawn, the tide of various feeling overpowered them; and\nshe sunk into one of those long and deep faintings which were now\nunhappily become in some degree constitutional with her. Mr Raby having\ngiven directions for her recovery, placed De Courcy in Lady Pelham's\ncarriage, and himself attended him to Norwood; where he mitigated Mrs De\nCourcy's horror and distress by assuring her of her son's safety, which\nhe again delighted Montague by ascribing to the cares of Laura.\n\nIt was late in the evening before Laura was sufficiently collected to\nreview with composure the events of the day! As soon, however, as she\nwas capable of considering all the circumstances, a suspicion occurred\nthat her unfortunate interview with Hargrave had been sanctioned, if not\ncontrived by Lady Pelham. That he should know the place and the hour in\nwhich he might surprise her alone;--that to this place, which because of\nits loneliness she had of late rather deserted, she should be conducted\nby her aunt;--that at this moment she should upon a trivial pretence be\nleft in solitude,--seemed a coincidence too strong to be merely\naccidental. She recollected some symptoms of private communication\nbetween Lady Pelham and Hargrave. Suspicions of connivance in the\ninfamous strategem of her arrest again revived in her mind. Lady Pelham,\nshe perceived, had afforded her a protection at best imperfect, perhaps\ntreacherous. Hargrave's late threats too, as she revolved them in her\nthoughts, appeared more like the intimations of settled design than the\nvague ravings of passion. Prudence, therefore, seemed to require that\nshe should immediately provide for her own safety: and indignation at\nher aunt's breach of confidence, hastened the purpose which she formed,\nto leave Walbourne without delay. She determined to go the next morning\nto Norwood, there to remain till De Courcy shewed signs of\nconvalescence, and then perform her long-projected journey to Scotland.\n\nIn order to avoid unpleasant altercation, she resolved to depart without\nwarning Lady Pelham of her intention; merely announcing by letter the\nreasons of her conduct. The affectionate Laura would not have parted\nfrom the meanest servant without a kindly farewell; but her innate\nabhorrence of treachery steeled her heart, and she rejoiced that it was\npossible to escape all present intercourse with her deceitful kinswoman.\n\nAs soon as the dawn appeared she arose; and on her knees thankfully\nacknowledged the protecting care which had watched over her, since first\nas a destitute orphan she applied to Lady Pelham. She blessed the\ngoodness which had softened in her favour a heart little subject to\nbenevolent expressions, which had restored her in sickness, consoled her\nin sorrow, delivered her from the snares of the wicked, and opened to\nher the joys of virtuous friendship. And where is the wretch so\nmiserable that he may not in the review of eighteen months find subjects\nof gratitude still more numerous! Laura began no important action of her\nlife without imploring a blessing on the event; and she now proceeded to\ncommend herself and her future prospects to the same care of which she\nhad glad experience.\n\nThe proper business of the morning ended, she had begun to make\narrangements for her immediate departure; when she heard Lady Pelham's\nbell ring, and the next instant heard a noise like that occasioned by\nthe fall of something heavy. She listened for a while, but all was again\nstill. The rest of the family were yet buried in sleep, and Laura\nhearing no one stirring to answer Lady Pelham's summons, began to fear\nthat her aunt was ill, perhaps unable to make any further effort to\nprocure assistance. At this idea, all her just indignation subsiding in\na moment, she flew to Lady Pelham's chamber.\n\nLady Pelham was lying on the floor, having apparently fallen in an\nattempt to rise from her bed. She was alive though insensible; and her\nface, though altered, was still florid. Laura soon procuring help,\nraised her from the ground; and guessing that apoplexy was her disorder,\nplaced her in an upright posture, loosened her night-clothes, and having\nhurried away a servant for Mr Raby, ventured, until his arrival, upon\nsuch simple remedies as she knew might be safely administered. In little\nmore than an hour the surgeon arrived; and having examined his patient,\ndeclared her to be in extreme danger. Before he left her, however, he\nsucceeded in restoring her to some degree of recollection; yet, far from\nchanging his first opinion, he advised Laura to lose no time in making\nevery necessary use of an amendment which he feared would be only\ntransient.\n\nFrom Lady Pelham, he went to Norwood; and returning to Walbourne in the\nevening, brought the pleasing intelligence that De Courcy continued to\ndo well. This second visit produced no change in his sentiments, and he\nremained persuaded that though Lady Pelham might continue to linger for\na time, the shock had been too great to allow of complete recovery.\nLaura now rejoiced that she had not executed her purpose of leaving\nWalbourne; since, had her aunt's illness succeeded to the rage which her\ndeparture would have excited, she could never have ceased to blame\nherself as the cause. She looked with profound compassion, too, upon the\ncondition of an unfortunate being, whose death-bed was neither smoothed\nby affection, nor cheered by pious hope. 'Unhappy woman!' thought she,\nas she sat watching an unquiet slumber into which her aunt had fallen,\n'to whom the best gifts of nature and of fortune have, by some fatality,\nbeen useless, or worse than useless; whose affluence has purchased no\nhigher joys than half-grudged luxuries; whose abilities have dazzled\nothers and bewildered herself, but lent no steady light to guide her\nway; whose generosity has called forth no gratitude, whose kindness has\nawakened no affection; to whom length of days has brought no reverence,\nand length of intimacy no friends! Even the sacred ties of nature have\nbeen to her unblessed. Her only child, driven from her in anger, dares\nnot approach to share the last sad offices with me, who, in performing\nthem, must forgive as well as pity. Favourite of fortune! what has been\nwanting to thee save that blessing which \"bringeth no sorrow with it.\"\nBut that blessing was light in thine esteem; and amidst the glitter of\nthy toys, the \"pearl of great price\" was disregarded.'\n\nFor some days Lady Pelham continued much in the same situation. She\nsuffered no pain, yet gave no signs of amendment. On the sixth morning\nfrom her first attack she grew suddenly and materially worse. It was\nsoon discovered that her limbs were paralyzed, and the surgeon declared\nthat her end could not be very distant. Her senses, however, again\nreturned, and she continued free from pain. She shewed little\napprehension of her own danger; and Laura debated with herself whether\nshe should permit her aunt to dream away the last precious hours of\nprobation, or endeavour to awaken her to a sense of her condition.\n\nLaura had no faith in death-bed repentance. She knew that resolution of\namendment which there is no longer time to practise, and renunciation of\nsin made under the immediate prospect of punishment, are at best\nsuspicious. She knew that, in the ordinary course of providence, the\ngrace which has been long despised is at length justly withdrawn. Yet\nshe saw that she had no right to judge Lady Pelham as wholly impenitent;\nand she considered a death-bed as highly suitable to the renewal, though\nnot to the beginning of repentance. She knew too, that the call _might_\nbe made effectual at the 'eleventh hour;' and the bare chance was worth\nthe toil of ages. She felt how little she herself would have valued the\nmistaken pity which could suffer her to enter on the 'dark valley'\nwithout a warning to cling closer to the 'staff and rod' of\ncomfort:--She therefore ventured to hint gently to Lady Pelham the\nopinion of her medical friends, and to remind her of the duty of\npreparing for the worst.\n\nLady Pelham at first appeared a good deal shocked; and lay for some time\napparently meditating upon her situation. At last, recovering her\nspirits, she said, 'Your nerves, Laura, were always so coarse, that you\nseemed to me to take a pleasure in thinking of shocking things; but I\nam sure it is abominably barbarous in you to tease me with them now I am\nill. Do keep your horrid fancies to yourself, or keep away till you are\ncured of the vapours--I dare say it is your dismal face that makes me\ndream so unpleasantly.'\n\nLaura, however, was not to be so discouraged. She took occasion to\nrepresent that no harm could ensue from preparing to meet the foe; since\nhis march was not to be retarded by shutting our eyes on his advances,\nnor hastened by the daring which watched his approach. She at length\nthought she had succeeded in convincing her aunt of her danger. Lady\nPelham _said_ that she feared she was dying, and she believed that she\nsaid the truth. But Lady Pelham had had sixty years practice in\nself-deceit. The fear might flutter in her imagination, but was not\nstrong enough to touch her heart. Laura, however, made use of her\nacknowledgement to press upon her the duties of forgiveness and charity\ntowards all mindkind, and especially towards her child; reminding her of\nthe affecting parity of situation between offending man and his\ndisobedient offspring. Lady Pelham at first answered impatiently that\nshe would not be argued on this subject; but as her spirits began to\nfail under the first confinement which she had ever endured, she became\nmore tractable. 'God knows,' said she to Laura, one day, 'we all have\nmuch need to be forgiven; and therefore we must forgive in our turn. For\nmy part I am sure I die in charity with all mankind, and with that\ncreature among the rest. However, I shall take my friend the Spectator's\nadvice, and remember the difference between giving and _for_giving.'\n\nLaura often begged permission to send for Mrs Herbert; but Lady Pelham\nsometimes postponed it till she should get better, sometimes till she\nshould grow worse. Laura was in the meantime her constant attendant;\nbearing with her peevishness, soothing her caprice, and striving to\nrouse in her feelings suitable to her condition. Finding, however, that\nshe made but little progress in her pious work, she begged that she\nmight be allowed to take the assistance of a clergyman. 'A clergyman,\nchild!' cried Lady Pelham. 'Do you imagine me to be a papist? Or do you\nthink me capable of such weak superstitution as to place more reliance\non a parson's prayers than on yours, or my maid Betty's? No, no! I trust\nI have been no worse than other people; and I hope, though I may be\nweak, I shall never be fanatical. Besides, I have too high a sense of\nthe Divine Justice to think that our Maker would first give us\nungovernable passions, and then punish us for yielding to them. A\nphlegmatic being like you, may indeed be called to strict account; but\npeople of strong feelings must be judged by a different standard.' 'Oh,\nMadam,' said Laura, 'be assured that our Maker gives us no unconquerable\npassions. If we ourselves have made them so, it becomes us to be humbled\nin the dust, not to glory in the presumptuous hope that He will soften\nthe sanctions of his law to favour our remissness.'\n\nDriven from the strong hold of justice, rather by the increase of her\nbodily languor, than by the force of truth, the dying sinner had\nrecourse to mercy,--a mercy, however, of her own composing. 'It is\ntrue,' said she one day to Laura, 'that I have done some things which I\nhave reason to regret, and which, I must confess, deserve punishment.\nBut Divine Mercy towards believers, we are told, is infinite; and though\nI may at times have doubted, I have never disbelieved.' Laura,\nshuddering at this awful blindness, was striving to frame a useful\nreply, when she saw her aunt's countenance change. It was distorted by a\nmomentary convulsion, and then fixed for ever in the stillness of\ndeath.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nLaura was more shocked than afflicted by the death of a person whom she\nwas unable to love, and had no reason to respect. She lost no time in\nconveying the news to Mrs Herbert, begging that she would herself come\nand give the necessary directions. Thinking it proper to remain at\nWalbourne till after her aunt's funeral, she refused Mrs De Courcy's\ninvitation to spend at Norwood the time which intervened. De Courcy\ncontinued to recover fast; and Laura, thinking she might soon leave him\nwithout anxiety, again fixed an early day for her journey to Scotland.\n\nNotwithstanding Laura's knowledge of the phlegmatic temperament of her\ncousin, she was surprised at the stoicism with which Mrs Herbert\nsupported the death of her mother. She examined the dead body with a\ncold comment on its appearance; gave orders for the interment in an\nunfaltering voice; and neither seemed to feel nor to affect the\nslightest concern. Nor did her philosophy appear to fail her one jot,\nwhen, upon opening the will, she was found to be left without\ninheritance. The paper, which had been drawn up a few months before,\nevinced Lady Pelham's adherence to her scheme for her niece's\nadvancement; and this, with her obstinate enmity to Mrs Herbert,\nfurnished the only instance of her consistency or perseverance, which\nwere ever known to the world. Her whole property she bequeathed to Laura\nMontreville, and to her second son upon taking the name of Pelham,\nprovided that Laura married Colonel Hargrave, or a peer, or the eldest\nson of a peer; but if she married a commoner, or remained unmarried, she\nwas to inherit only ten thousand pounds, the bulk of the property going\nto a distant relation.\n\nThe very hour that this will was made public, Laura informed the\ncontingent heir that he might possess himself of his inheritance, since\nshe would certainly never perform the conditions which alone could\ndestroy his claim. Not acquiescing in the justice of excluding Mrs\nHerbert from her natural rights she would instantly have offered to\nshare with her cousin the bequest of Lady Pelham; but considering that\nher engagement with De Courcy entitled him to decide on the disposal of\nwhatever belonged to his future wife, she hastened to ask his sanction\nto her purpose. De Courcy, without hesitation, advised that the whole\nshould be given up to its natural owner. 'We shall have enough for\nhumble comfort, dear Laura,' said he, 'and have no need to grasp at a\ndoubtful claim.' Laura, however, differed from him in opinion. She\nthought she might, in strict justice, retain part of the bequest of so\nnear a relation; and she felt pleased to think that she should enter the\nDe Courcy family not altogether portionless. She therefore reserved two\nthousand pounds, giving up the rest unconditionally to Mrs Herbert.\n\nThese points being settled, nothing now remained to retard Laura's\njourney to Scotland. Mrs De Courcy, indeed, urged her to postpone it\ntill Montague should acquire a right to be her escort; but Laura\nobjected that it was her wish to give a longer time to her old friend\nthan she thought it proper to withdraw De Courcy from his business and\nhis home. She reflected, too, with a light heart, that a protector in\nher journey was now less necessary, since her mad lover, as Harriet\ncalled Colonel Hargrave, had embarked for America. Laura had heard of\nhis departure before her aunt's death; and she gladly observed that\nfavourable winds were speeding him across the Atlantic.\n\nThe day preceding that on which she meant to leave Walbourne, she spent\nwith Mrs De Courcy and Montague; who, though not entirely recovered, was\nable to resume his station in the family-room. De Courcy, with the\nenthusiasm of youth and love, spoke of his happy prospects; his mother,\nwith the sober eye of experience, looked forward to joys as substantial,\nthough less dazzling; while feminine modesty suppressed the pleasure\nwith which Laura felt that she was necessary to these schemes of bliss.\nWith the confidence of mutual esteem they arranged their plan of\nlife,--a plan at once embracing usefulness and leisure, retirement and\nhospitality. Laura consented that one month, 'one little month,' should\nbegin the accomplishment of these golden dreams; for she permitted De\nCourcy to follow her at the end of that time to Scotland. A few weeks\nthey were to spend in wandering through the romantic scenes of her\nnative land; and then join Mrs De Courcy at Norwood, which was to\ncontinue her permanent abode.\n\nLaura remained with her friends till the evening was closing; then,\navoiding the solemnity of a farewell by a half-promise of stopping as\nshe passed the next day, she sprung into Mrs De Courcy's carriage, and\ndrove off. Tears rushed to De Courcy's eyes as the carriage was lost to\nhis sight. 'I am still weak,' thought he as he dashed them away. 'She\nwill soon return to bring gladness to every heart, and double joy to\nmine. To-morrow too I shall see her,' thought he; yet he continued\ndepressed, and soon retired to his chamber.\n\nMrs De Courcy and her son met early the next morning, expecting that\nLaura would early begin her journey. Montague stationed himself at the\nwindow to watch for her appearance; half fearing that she would not keep\nher promise, yet every minute repeating that it was impossible she could\ngo without bidding farewell. The breakfast hour arrived, and still Laura\ncame not. De Courcy, impatient, forgot his weakness, and insisted upon\nwalking to the gate that he might inquire whether a carriage had passed\nfrom Walbourne.\n\nHe had scarcely left the house when old John, with a face that boded\nevil, hastily came to beg that his Lady would speak with a servant of\nLady Pelham's. Mrs De Courcy, somewhat alarmed, desired that the servant\nmight come in. 'Please, Madam,' said he, 'let me know where I may find\nMiss Montreville. The carriage has waited for her these three hours?'\n'Good heavens!' cried Mrs De Courcy, in consternation. 'Is Miss\nMontreville not at Walbourne?' 'No, Madam, she has not been there since\nyesterday morning.' Mrs De Courcy, now in extreme alarm, summoned her\ncoachman, and desired to know where he had left Miss Montreville the\nevening before. He answered, that, at Laura's desire, he had set her\ndown at the gate of Walbourne; that he had seen her enter; and\nafterwards, in turning the carriage, had observed her walking along the\navenue towards the house. Inexpressibly shocked, Mrs De Courcy had yet\nthe presence of mind to forbid alarming her son with these fearful\ntidings. As soon as she could recollect herself, she dispatched old\nWilson, on whose discretion she thought she might rely, to inform De\nCourcy that a message from Walbourne had made her cease to expect\nLaura's visit. Montague returned home, sad and disappointed. His\nmelancholy questions and comments increased the distress of his mother.\n'Did she not even write one line?' said he. 'Could you have believed\nthat she would go without one farewell--that she could have passed our\nvery gate?' 'She was willing to spare you the pain of a farewell,' said\nMrs De Courcy, checking the anguish of her heart. 'She will write soon,\nI hope.'\n\nBut day after day passed, and Laura did not write. Mrs De Courcy, still\nconcealing from her son a misfortune which she thought him yet unequal\nto bear, used every possible exertion to trace the fugitive. She offered\nhigh rewards to whoever could afford the smallest clue to discovery. She\nadvertised in every newspaper except that which De Courcy was accustomed\nto read. Her suspicions at first falling upon Hargrave, she caused\nparticular inquiry to be made whether any of his domestics had been left\nin England with orders to follow him; but she found that he with his\nwhole suite had sailed from Europe more than a fortnight before Laura's\ndisappearance. She employed emissaries to prosecute the search in almost\nevery part of the kingdom. Judging the metropolis to be the most likely\nplace of concealment, she made application to the officers of police for\nassistance in her inquiries there. All was in vain. No trace of Laura\nwas to be found.\n\nFor a while De Courcy amused himself from day to day with the hope of\nhearing from her; a hope which his mother had not the courage to\ndestroy. He calculated that she would reach the end of her journey on\nthe sixth day after that on which she left him. On the seventh she would\ncertainly write; therefore in four or five more he should undoubtedly\nhear from her. The expected day came and passed as others had done,\nwithout bringing news of Laura. Another and another came, and ended only\nin disappointment. De Courcy was miserable. He knew not how to account\nfor a silence so adverse to the considerate kindness of Laura's\ncharacter, except by supposing that illness made her unable to write.\nThis idea gathering strength in his mind, he resolved to follow her\nimmediately to Scotland, tracing her through the route which he knew she\nintended to take. Mrs De Courcy in vain attempted to dissuade him from\nthe prosecution of his design, and to sooth him with hopes which she\nknew too well would prove deceitful. He was resolute, and Mrs De Courcy\nwas at last obliged to prevent his fruitless journey by unfolding the\ntruth. The utmost tenderness of caution was insufficient to prevent the\neffects of this blow on De Courcy's bodily frame. In a few hours strong\nfever seized him; and his wound, which had hitherto worn a favourable\nappearance, gave alarming symptoms of inflammation. Three weeks did Mrs\nDe Courcy watch by his bedside in all the anguish of a mother's fears;\nforgetting, in her anxiety for his life, that he must for a time live\nonly to sorrow. The balance long hung doubtful. At length the strength\nof his constitution and his early habits of temperance prevailed. By\nslow degrees his health was restored, though his spirits were still\noppressed by a dejection which long withstood every effort of reason and\nreligion.\n\nTo divert his sorrow rather than in the hope of removing its cause, he\nleft his home and wandered through the most unfrequented parts of\nEngland, making anxious, yet almost hopeless, inquiries for his lost\ntreasure. Sometimes, misled by false intelligence, he was hurried from\nplace to place in all the eagerness of expectation, but bitter\ndisappointment closed the pursuit; and the companion of his relaxation,\nhis encouragement in study, his pattern in virtue, the friend, the\nmistress, almost the wife, was lost beyond recal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile De Courcy was thus languishing on a sick-bed or wandering restless\nand miserable, Laura too was a wanderer, a prey to care more deep, more\nhopeless.\n\nThe soft shades of twilight were stealing on as she cast a last look\nback towards Norwood; and were deepening fast as with a sigh,\nhalf-pleasing, half-melancholy, she surveyed the sheltering chestnut\ntree where she had once parted from De Courcy. As she approached her\nhome, the stars coming forth poured their silent language into the ear\nof piety. Never deaf to this holy call, Laura dismissed her attendants\nthat she might meditate alone. She proceeded slowly along till she came\nto the entrance of a woody lane, which branched off from the avenue. She\nstopped, half-inclined to enter; a sensation of fear made her pause. The\nnext moment the very consciousness of that sensation induced her to\nproceed. 'This is mere childish superstition,' said she, and entered the\nlane. She had taken only a few steps when she felt herself suddenly\nseized from behind; one person forcibly confining her arms while another\nprevented her cries. Vainly struggling against masculine strength, she\nwas hurried rapidly forward, till, her breath failing, she could resist\nno farther. Her conductors, soon quitting the beaten path, dragged her\non through a little wood that sheltered the lawn towards the east; till\nreaching a gap which appeared to have been purposely made in the park\nwall, Laura perceived a carriage in waiting. Again exerting the strength\nof desperation, she struggled wildly for freedom; but the unequal\ncontest soon was closed; she was lifted into the carriage; one of the\nmen took his place by her side, and they drove off with the speed of\nlightning.\n\nFrom the moment when she recovered recollection, Laura had not a doubt\nthat she owed this outrage to Hargrave. She was convinced that his\npretence of leaving the kingdom had been merely intended to throw her\noff her guard, and that he was now waiting, at no distant place, the\nsuccess of his daring villany. At this idea, a horrible dread seized\nher, she threw herself back in the carriage, and wept in despair. Her\nattendant perceiving that she no longer struggled, with a coarse\nexpression of pity, released her from his grasp; and taking the\nhandkerchief from her mouth, told her 'she might cry as long as she\npleased, for he knew it did a woman's heart good to cry.' Laura now\nbesought him to tell her whither she was going. 'You'll know that by and\nby,' said he. 'Let me alone. I am going to sleep; do you the same.'\n\nThe bare mention of his purpose revived Laura's hopes. 'Surely,' thought\nshe, 'while he sleeps, I may escape. In spite of this fearful speed I\nmay spring out; and if I could but gain a few steps, in this darkness I\nshould be safe.' Full of this project, she remained still as the dead;\nfearing by the slightest sound or motion to retard the sleep of her\nguard. At last his breathing announced that he was asleep; and Laura\nbegan, with trembling hands, to attempt her escape. The blinds were\ndrawn up; and if she could let down that on the side of the carriage\nwhere she sat, she might without difficulty open the door. She tried to\nstir the blind. It refused to yield. She used her utmost force, but it\nremained firm. She ventured, cautious and trembling, to attempt that on\nthe other side. It dropt; and Laura thought she was free. It only\nremained to open the door of the chaise and leap out. She tried it; but\nthe door was immoveable, and, in despair, she shrunk back. Again she\nstarted up; for it occurred to her that, though with more danger, she\nmight escape by the window. Cautiously stepping across her guard, she\nleant out and placed her hands on the top of the carriage, that,\ntrusting to her arms for supporting her weight, she might extricate\nherself, and drop from thence into the road. Raising herself upon the\nedge of the step, she fixed her hands more firmly. She paused a moment\nto listen whether her guard were undisturbed. He still slept soundly;\nand resting her limbs upon the window frame, she prepared to complete\nher escape.\n\nA moment more and she had been free; when a horseman riding up, pushed\nher fiercely back, upbraiding, with tremendous oaths, the carelessness\nof his companion. The fellow, rousing himself, retorted upon the\nwretched Laura the abuse of his comrade, swearing that 'since he saw she\nwas so cunning, he would keep better watch on her for the future.'\n\nThe desponding Laura endured his reproaches in silence. Finding herself\nthus doubly guarded, she resigned all hope of escaping by her own\nunaided exertions; and mingling silent prayers with her fearful\nanticipations, she strove to reanimate her trust that she should not be\nwholly forsaken. Sometimes her habitual confidence prevailed, and she\nfelt assured, that she should not be left a prey to the wicked. Yet the\ndreadful threats, the fiery passions of Hargrave rose to her\nrecollection, and she again shuddered in despair. She suddenly\nremembered Jessy Wilson. Starting, with an exclamation of horror and\naffright, she sought some weapon which might dispense to her a death\nless terrible; and instinctively grasping her pen-knife hid it in her\nbosom. The next moment she shrunk from her purpose, and doubted the\nlawfulness of such defence. 'Will he dare his own life, too?' thought\nshe. 'Oh, Heaven! in mercy spare me the necessity of sending a wretch to\nhis great account, with all his crimes unrepented on his head--or pardon\nhim and me?'\n\nShe continued to commend herself to Heaven, till her terrors by degrees\nsubsided. She began again to feel the steady trust which is acquired by\nall who are habituated to a grateful consideration of the care which\nthey experience; a trust that even the most adverse events shall\nterminate in their real advantage; that the rugged and slippery ways of\nthis dark wilderness, shall, at the dawn of everlasting day, be owned as\nthe fittest to conduct us to the house of our Father. She began, too, to\nregain the confidence which strong minds naturally put in their own\nexertions. She resolved not to be wanting to herself; nor, by brooding\nover her terrors, to disable herself from taking advantage of any\nprovidential circumstance which might favour her escape.\n\nMorning at length began to dawn, but the blinds being closely drawn up,\nLaura could make no observations on the country through which she was\npassing. She remarked that the furious speed with which she had first\nbeen driven, had slackened to a slow pace; and she judged that the\nwearied cattle could not proceed much further. She hoped that it would\nsoon be necessary to stop; and that during the few minutes in which they\nhalted to change horses, she might find means of appealing to the\njustice of her fellow-creatures. 'Surely,' said she, 'some heart will be\nopen to me.'\n\nAfter proceeding slowly for some time the carriage stopped. Laura\nlistened for the sounds of human voices, but all was silent. She heard\nthe trampling of horses as if led close by the carriage. Some one was\ncertainly near who had no interest in this base oppression. 'Help! Oh\nhelp me,' cried Laura. 'I am cruelly and wrongfully detained. I have\nfriends that will reward you. Heaven will reward you!--Help me! for kind\nmercy, help me!' 'Heyday!' cried the fellow in the carriage, with\nsomething between a grin and a stare, 'who is the girl speaking to?\nWhat! did you imagine we should be wise enough to bring you within holla\nof a whole yardful of stable boys and piping chambermaids? Reward\nindeed! Set your heart at rest, Miss; we shall be rewarded without your\nfriends or Heaven either.'\n\nThe carriage again proceeded with the same speed as at first, and Laura\nstrove to support with composure this new blow to her hopes. Her\ncompanion, now producing a bottle of wine and some biscuits, advised her\nto share with him; and that she might not wilfully lavish her strength\nand spirits, she consented. Once more in the course of the day the\ntravellers stopped to change horses, and Laura once more, though with\nfeebler hopes, renewed her appeals to justice and mercy. No answer\ngreeted her. Again she was hurried on her melancholy way.\n\nThe day, as it advanced, seemed rough and gloomy. The wind swept in\ngusts through the trees, and the rain beat upon the carriage. The\nevening was drawing on when Laura remarked that the motion was changed.\nThe chaise proceeded slowly over soft uneven ground, and she guessed,\nwith dismay, that it had quitted all frequented paths. In renewed alarm,\nshe again besought her companion to tell her whither he meant to conduct\nher, and for what end she was thus cruelly forced from her home. 'Why,\nhow should I tell you what I do not know myself?' answered the man. 'I\nshan't conduct you much farther--and a good riddance. As for the end\nyou'll see that when it comes.'\n\nAbout an hour after quitting the road, the carriage stopped; and the man\nletting down the blind, Laura perceived through the dusk, that they were\non a barren moor. Waste and level, it seemed to spread before her; but\nthe darkness prevented her from distinguishing its features or its\nboundaries. Suddenly, as the gust died away, she fancied she heard the\nroar of waters. She listened; but the wind swelled again, and she heard\nonly its howlings over the heath. The horseman, who had rode away when\nthe carriage stopped, now gallopped back, and directed the postilion to\nproceed. They went on for a few hundred yards, and again they stopped.\nThe roar of waters again burst on Laura's ear, now swelling in thunder,\nnow sinking in a sullen murmur. She saw a light glimmer at a distance.\nIt was tossed by the billows of the ocean.\n\nThe door of the chaise was opened, and she was lifted from it. Gliding\nfrom the arms of the ruffian who held her, and clasping his knees, 'Oh!\nif you have the heart of a man,' she cried, 'let me not be torn from my\nnative land--let me not be cast on the merciless deep. Think what it is\nto be an exile--friendless in a strange land--the sport, the prey of a\npitiless enemy. Oh! if you have need of mercy, have mercy upon\nme.'--'Holla! Robert,' shouted the ruffian, 'take away this girl. She's\nenough to make a man play the fool and whimper.' The other fellow now\napproaching, lifted Laura, more dead than alive, from the ground, and,\nwrapping her in a large cloak, bore her towards the beach.\n\nIn a creek sheltered by rocks from the breakers, lay a small boat. One\nman sat near the bow, roaring a hoarse sea-song. As the party\napproached, he rose, and pushing the boat ashore, received the half\nlifeless Laura in his brawny arms, cursing her with strange oaths for\nhaving made him wait so long. Then, on his uttering a discordant yell,\ntwo of his companions appeared; and after exchanging with Laura's guards\na murmuring account of the trouble they had undergone, pushed off from\nthe land. The keel grated along the pebbles; the next moment it floated\non the waves, and Laura starting up, threw back the cloak from her face,\nand with strained eyes gazed on her parting native land, till all behind\nwas darkness.\n\nA pang of anguish striking to her heart, she made once more a desperate\neffort to awaken pity. Stretching her clasped hands towards the man who\nsat near her, she cried, in the piercing voice of misery, 'Oh take pity\non me! I am an orphan. I have heard that sailors have kindly\nhearts--Have pity then--land me on the wildest coast, and I will fall\ndown and pray for you!' The person to whom she spoke having eyed her a\nmoment in silence, coolly drew in his oar; and rising, wrapped her close\nin the cloak and laid her down in the bottom of the boat, advising her\nwith an oath to 'keep snug or she would capsize them.' In despair she\nrenounced all further effort. Silent and motionless she lay, the cold\nspray dashing over her unheeded; till wet, chilled, and miserable, she\nwas lifted on board a small brig which lay about half a mile from the\nshore. She was carried down to the cabin, which was more decent than is\nusual in vessels of that size. A clean-looking woman attended to\nundress her; night-clothes were in readiness for her; and every\naccommodation provided which her situation rendered possible. Every\nthing served to convince her of the care and precaution with which this\ncruel scheme had been concerted, and to shew her the depth of the snare\ninto which she had fallen.\n\nShe was laid in her narrow crib, ere it occurred to her that Hargrave\nmight be near to watch his prey. Exhausted as she was, sleep fled at the\nthought. She listened for his voice, for his footstep, amid the unwonted\ndiscord that disturbed her ear. Daylight returned, and no sound reached\nher more terrible than that of the gale rattling in the cordage and\ndashing the waves against the vessel's side. Worn out with fatigue and\nsuffering, she slept at length; and a mid-day sun glanced by fits\nthrough her grated window ere she awoke to a new sense of sorrow. She\nrose, and going upon deck, looked sadly back upon the way she had\nunconsciously passed. Behind, the blue mountains were sinking in the\ndistance; on the left lay a coast unknown to her; before her stretched\nthe boundless deep, unvaried save by the whitening surge.\n\nLaura spent most of her time upon deck, the fresh air reviving her\nfailing spirits. One male and one female attendant seemed appropriated\nto her, and served her with even officious assiduity. Hoping that some\nopportunity might occur of transmitting an account of her situation to\nEngland, she begged these obsequious attendants to supply her with\nwriting materials; but was firmly, though respectfully, refused.\n\nThe third morning came, and Laura looked in vain for any object to vary\nthe immeasurable waste. The sun rose from one unbending line, and sunk\nagain in naked majesty. She observed that the course of the vessel was\nin general directly west; and if she had before doubted, this\ncircumstance would have convinced her of her destination. She once\nventured to inquire whither the ship was bound, but was answered that\n'she should know that when she reached the port.'\n\nIt was on the fourth of May that Laura began her ill-omened voyage. On\nthe twelfth of June, land! All ran to gaze with glad eyes on what seemed\na low cloud, faintly descried on the verge of the horizon--all but\nLaura, who looked sadly forward, as to the land of exile, of\ndegradation,--of death. Day after day that dreaded land approached;\ntill, by degrees, the boundless ocean was narrowed to a mighty river,\nand the unfrequent sail, almost too distant for mortal sight, was\nmultiplied to a busy fleet, plying in every direction their cheerful\nlabours. At length a city appeared in view, rising like an amphitheatre,\nand flashing bright with a material unknown to European architecture.\nLaura inquired what town it was; and, though refused all information,\nsurmised that Quebec lay before her.\n\nOpposite the town, the ship hove to; a boat was launched, and Laura\nexpected to be sent on shore. Nor did she unwillingly prepare to go.\n'Surely,' thought she, 'in this populous city some one will be found to\nlisten to my tale, and wrest me from the arm of the oppressor.' The boat\nhowever departed without her, carrying ashore the man who had hitherto\nattended her. After remaining on shore for several hours, the man\nreturned, and the vessel again proceeded in her voyage. Laura now\nimagined that Montreal was her destined port; and again she strove to\nhope that, among numbers, she should find aid.\n\nA still cloudy evening had succeeded to a sultry day, when Laura\nobserved an unusual bustle upon deck. It was growing dark, when, as she\nleant over the rail, to watch the fire-flies that flashed like stars in\nthe air, the captain approaching her, told her that she must go ashore,\nand immediately lifted her into a boat which lay along-side. Her\nattendants and baggage were already there; the sailors had taken their\noars; and, roaring to their companions a rough 'good night,' made\ntowards the land. Instead, however, of gaining the nearest point, they\nrowed into what in the darkness seemed a creek; but Laura soon perceived\nthat, having left the great river on which they had hitherto sailed,\nthey were following the course of one of its tributary streams. The\ndarkness prevented her from distinguishing objects on the banks, though\nnow and then a light, glimmering from a casement, shewed that the haunts\nof man were near. She could not even discern the countenances of the\nsailors; but she observed, that he who seemed to direct the others,\nspoke in a voice which was new to her ear. All night the rowers toiled\nup the stream. The day dawned; and Laura perceived that, passing an open\ncultivated plain, she was pursuing her course towards woods impervious\nto the light. Dark and tangled they lowered over the stream, till they\nclosed round, and every cheerful object was blotted from the scene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nThe travellers had proceeded for some time shaded by the overhanging\nwoods, the distance lengthened by the dreary sameness of their way, when\na wild halloo smote Laura's ear; and she perceived that three Indians\nstood at the water-edge, making signs for the boat to land. To her\nunspeakable surprise, the sailors joyfully obeyed the signal. They ran\ntheir bark into a creek to which the Indians pointed, and cheerfully\nbusied themselves in discharging their cargo. Placed with her attendants\non a little eminence, which rose above the swampy margin of the river,\nLaura took a fearful survey of the scene around her. Save where the\nsluggish stream opened to the day, her view was bounded to a few yards\nof marshy ground, rank with unwholesome vegetation. No track appeared to\nlead from this desolate spot. Between the gigantic pines, brushwood and\ncoarse grass spread in sad luxuriance. No trace was here of human\nfootstep. All was dreary and forlorn, as the land which the first\nwanderers visited unwilling.\n\nShe had not long continued her melancholy survey, when the two stoutest\nof the Indians approached; and one of them, after talking apart with her\nattendants, lifted her female servant in his arms, and walked on. The\nother, making some uncouth gestures, prepared to raise Laura from the\nground. She shrunk back alarmed; but the Indian, in broken French,\nassured her that he would not hurt her; and, pointing towards the woods,\nreminded her of the difficulty of passing them on foot. Her valet, too,\nrepresented the fatigue she must undergo, if she refused the assistance\nof the Indian. But Laura preferring a toilsome march to such a mode of\nconveyance, persevered in her refusal; and, bidding them lead the way,\nfollowed into the pathless wild.\n\nThey continued their journey for several hours, no object meeting their\nsight that might mark the stages of their way. No work of man appeared,\nnot even the faintest trace that ever man had toiled through this\nwilderness; yet Laura perceived that the Indians proceeded without\nhesitation. The position of the grass, the appearance of the leaves,\ngave indication sufficient to guide them in their route. One of them\ncarried a bag of provisions; and having reached a spot where the ground\nwas firm and dry, he invited Laura to sit down and take some\nrefreshment. Faint with fatigue, Laura thankfully acceded. Scarcely,\nhowever, had she seated herself on the grass, ere her attention was\ndrawn by a slight though unusual noise; and she was told that it was\ncaused by a rattlesnake. At this intelligence her maid, screaming,\nstarted up, and was going to dart forward into the wood. The Indians\nbeheld her terror with silent contempt, while Laura calmly detained her\nwith gentle force. 'Stay, Mary,' said she. 'If you tread on the animal\nyou are gone! If we are quiet, we may probably see and avoid it.' The\ninfluence which Laura always acquired over those with whom she lived,\nprevailed over Mary's dread; and in a few moments the serpent was seen\nby one of the Indians, who killed it with a single blow.\n\nTheir hasty meal ended, the party proceeded on their way; but they had\nnot gone far ere Laura, worn out with toil and sorrow, sunk upon the\nground. She had now no choice; and the Indian, lifting her with the same\nease as she would have done an infant, went on with more speed than\nbefore.\n\nTowards the close of the day, the woods suddenly opened into a small\nfield, surrounded by them on every side, which appeared to have been\nitself imperfectly redeemed from the same state of waste luxuriance. In\nthe centre stood a house, or rather cabin, rudely constructed of the\nmaterial which nature so lavishly supplied. Around it a small patch,\ninclosed by a palisade, bore marks of forsaken cultivation. Beyond this\ninclosure, logs of prodigious size lay scattered through the field, and\nthe roots, which had not been cleared from the ground, were again\nshooting luxuriantly. With a faint sensation of gladness, Laura beheld\ntraces of humankind. Yet no living creature appeared. Here reigned\nprimeval stillness. The winds had died away. A sultry calm filled the\nair. The woods were motionless. The birds were silent. All was fixed as\nin death, save where a dull stream stole under the tall canes that\ndeformed its margin.\n\nMary's exclamations of grief and surprise first informed Laura that she\nhad reached her home. To Laura the dreariness of the scene was of small\nconcern. No outward circumstances could add to the horrors with which\nher fears were familiar. While her attendant bewailed aloud that ever\nthirst of gain had lured her from happy England, Laura was inwardly\nstriving to revive the hope that sudden death might snatch her from the\ngrasp of the oppressor; and renewing her oft repeated prayer,--'Oh that\nThou wouldst hide me in the grave.' But no selfish sorrow could make her\nregardless of the woes of others. 'Courage, Mary,' said she, with a\nforeboding smile, 'we shall soon be released; and both, I hope, find\nshelter in our Father's house.'\n\nThe cabin was divided into three apartments, each entering from the\nother. To the innermost Laura was conducted; and she saw that it had\nbeen arranged for her. The window was secured with iron. The furniture,\nunlike that of the other rooms, was new and not inelegant. Laura looked\nround to observe whether any trace of Hargrave's presence was visible.\nNone appeared. She examined every recess and corner of her new abode, as\none who fears the lurking assassin. She ascertained that Hargrave was\nnot its inmate; and thanked Heaven for the prospect of one night of\npeace. It was in vain, however, that she tried to discover how long this\nreprieve might last. The servants either could not or would not give her\nany information. She was too well acquainted with the character of her\noppressor to hope that he would long delay his coming. 'To-morrow,\nperhaps'--thought she; and the cold shivering came over her, which now\never followed her anticipation of the future. 'Yet why do I despair?'\nsaid she. 'Is any time too short, are any means too feeble for the\nPower--for the wisdom in which I trust? But since the hour of trial may\nbe so near, let me not waste the time which should prepare for\nit,--prepare to cast off this poor clog of earth, and rise beyond its\nsorrows and its stains.'\n\nLaura's bodily frame, however, could not long keep pace with the efforts\nof her mind, for her health and strength were failing under the\ncontinued influence of grief and fear. The form, once rounded in fair\nproportion, was wasted to a shadow. The once graceful neck bent\nmournfully forward. The lily arms hung down in listless melancholy. The\ncheek, once of form inimitable, was sunk and hollow now. The colour,\nonce quick to tell the modest thought, was fixed in the paleness of the\ndead. And death was ever present to her thoughts,--sole point to which\nher hope turned steadily!\n\nOne only desire lingered on earth. She wished that some friend should\npity her hard fate, and know that the victim had shrunk from it, though\nin vain. Intending to leave behind her some attestation of her\ninnocence, she besought Mary to procure for her the means of writing.\n'Why should you fear to trust me?' said she. 'To whom upon earth can my\ncomplaint reach now? You may see all I write, Mary; and perhaps when I\nam gone you will yourself convey it to my friend. Your master will not\nprevent you then; for then he will have pity on me, and wish that he had\nnot dealt with me so hardly.' The irresistible sweetness of Laura had\nwon the heart of her attendant, and Mary promised that she would\nendeavour to gratify her. She said that the writing materials were kept\ncarefully locked up by Robert, the man-servant; that his master's orders\non that subject had been peremptory; that she was sure he would not\nventure to disobey while there remained a possibility of conveying\nintelligence from the place of their confinement; that two of the\nIndians were to depart on the following day; that after they were gone,\nno means of access to the habitable world remaining, Robert might\npossibly relax his strictness, and permit Laura to amuse herself with\nwriting. Mary's words awakened in Laura's mind an idea that all was not\nyet lost. The Indians were suspected of favouring her. They might then\nbear her appeal to human pity, to human justice. If she could find means\nto speak with them apart, she would plead so earnestly that even savages\nwould be moved to mercy! At these thoughts a ray of hope once more\nkindled in her breast. It was the last. All day she watched for an\nopportunity to address one of the Indians. In vain! Robert guarded her\nwith such relentless fidelity, that she found it impossible to effect\nher purpose. The Indians departed. Mary performed her promise, and the\nunfortunate Laura wrote the following letter, which was afterwards, with\nHargrave's permission, conveyed to Mrs Douglas.\n\n     'From this dreary land of exile, to whom shall I address myself\n     save to you, mine own friend, and my father's friend? Where\n     tell my sad fate save to you, who first taught me the hope that\n     lives beyond it? And let it comfort your kind heart to know,\n     that while you are shedding tears over this last memorial of\n     your Laura, I shall be rejoicing in the full consummation of\n     that hope.\n\n     'There is indeed another friend! One to whom my last earthly\n     thoughts are due! But I cannot tell him, that she who was\n     almost the wife of his bosom is gone down to a dishonoured\n     grave. I have not time to soften my sad tale to him, nor to\n     study words of comfort; for the moments are precious with me\n     now. A few, a very few, are all that remain for preparation. I\n     must not rob them of their awful right. Tell him my story as he\n     is able to bear it. Tell him my innocence, and he will believe\n     it, for he knew my very soul. But I must hasten, lest the\n     destroyer come, ere, in these lines, I close my connection with\n     this world of trial.'\n\n     [She then proceeded to give a simple narrative of her wrongs.\n     She expressed no bitterness against the author of them. She\n     spoke of him as a misguided being, and pitied the anguish which\n     he was preparing for himself.] 'Tell Mr De Courcy,' she\n     proceeded, 'that I charge him, by all the love he bears me, to\n     forgive my enemy, even from the heart forgive him. Let him do\n     more. Let him pray for him; and if they meet, admonish him. It\n     may be that his heart will soften when he remembers me.'\n\n     [The remainder of the letter was written at intervals. Laura\n     spent her time chiefly in acts of devotion, of\n     self-examination, and repentance. It was only when exhausted\n     nature could no longer follow these exercises of the soul, that\n     she returned to add another line to her picture of\n     wretchedness.]\n\n     'The saints who resisted unto blood striving against sin, who\n     gave up their lives in defence of the truth, looked forward to\n     the hour of their departure rejoicing. But I must go to the\n     grave laden with shame and sorrow. My soul is weary of my life,\n     and yet I must fear to die. Yet let my enemy a little while\n     delay his coming and my death also will be joyful. Let him stay\n     only a few days, and I shall be deaf to the voice of the\n     oppressor. I am wasting fast away. If he haste not to catch the\n     shadow, it will be gone.--\n\n     'The people whom he has appointed to guard his poor prisoner,\n     no longer watch me as they once did. It is useless now. A few\n     short steps and my feeble limbs bend to the earth, reminding me\n     whither I am hastening.--\n\n     'When I am gone, Mary will carry you the ringlets which you\n     were wont to twine round your finger. Send one of them to her\n     who should have been my sister; but give not any to my own\n     Montague, for he will pine over them when he might be happy in\n     some new connection. Yet tell him that I loved him to the end.\n     I believe he sometimes doubted of my love; but tell him that I\n     bore him a firm affection. Passion is unfit for the things of\n     this world.--\n\n     'I have a letter from my enemy. In two days more.--\n\n     'I have a knife concealed in my bosom. All night it is hidden\n     beneath my pillow; and when my weary eyes close for a moment, I\n     grasp it, and the chill touch rouses me again. Mine own dear\n     friend, did you think when first you taught me to join my\n     little hands in prayer, that these hands should be stained with\n     murder?--\n\n     'Is it a crime to die when I can no longer live with innocence?\n     When there is no escape but in the grave, is it forbidden to\n     hide me there? My mind grows feeble now. I cannot discern\n     between good and evil.--\n\n     'Why is my soul bowed down to the dust, as if the fountain of\n     compassion were sealed? I will yet trust Him who is the helper\n     of those who have no help in man. It may be that he will melt\n     the heart of my enemy, and move him to let me die in peace. Or\n     perhaps even the sight of my persecutor may be permitted to\n     burst the rending heart--to scare the trembling spirit from its\n     prison.--\n\n     'This day is my last, and it is closing now! The silence of\n     midnight is around me. Ere it again return a deeper night shall\n     close for me, and the weary pilgrim shall sink to rest. It is\n     time that I loosen me from the earth; I will not give my last\n     hours to this land of shadows. Then fare you well, mine own\n     dear friend! You first pointed my wishes to that better world\n     where I shall not long wait your coming. And far thee well,\n     mine own Montague! Take comfort. I was not fit to linger here;\n     for I had desires that earth could not satisfy; and thirstings\n     after a perfection which this weak heart could not attain.\n     Farewell--I will look back no more.'\n\n\n     HARGRAVE'S LETTER TO LAURA.\n\n     'My dearest Laura--The tantalizing business which has so long\n     thwarted my wishes will still detain me for two days. Your\n     gentle mind cannot imagine what this delay costs me. My only\n     recompense is, that it affords me an opportunity of shewing you\n     somewhat of that consideration with which I could always wish\n     to treat you. I willingly forego the advantage of surprise for\n     the sake of allowing you to exercise that decision which you\n     are so well qualified to use discreetly. You know Laura how I\n     have doated on you. For near four long years you have been the\n     desire of my soul; and now that my happy daring has placed me\n     within reach of my utmost wishes, I would fain attain them\n     without distress to you. This is no time for concealment; and\n     you must pardon me if I am explicit with you. I have known the\n     disposition of Lady Pelham's fortune from the hour when it was\n     made. You know that with all my faults I am not sordid; but\n     circumstances have rendered money necessary to me. Except in\n     the event of Lord Lincourt's death, I cannot return to England\n     otherwise than as your husband. I will own, too, dearest Laura,\n     that after all I have done, and all that I may be compelled to\n     do, I dare not trust for pardon to your pity alone. I must\n     interest your duty in my cause. Consider your situation, then,\n     my beloved, and spare me the pain of distressing you. I have\n     watched you, implored you, pined for you--I have borne your\n     coldness, your scorn. I have ventured my life to obtain you.\n     Judge whether I be of a temper to be baulked of my reward. You\n     must be mine, bewitching Laura. No cool, insulting, plausible\n     pretender can cheat me of you now. Trackless woods divide you\n     from all human kind. I have provided against the possibility of\n     tracing your retreat. It rests with you then to choose whether\n     you will bless my love with a willing and honourable reward, or\n     force me to extort the power of bestowing obligation. My\n     charming Laura, for now indeed I may call you mine, pardon, in\n     consideration of its sincerity, the abrupt language I am\n     compelled to hold.--One thing more. In three weeks I must\n     return hither. The engagement of your British attendants\n     expires before that time. I cannot for a moment allow myself to\n     suppose that you will prefer a hopeless solitary exile to the\n     reparation which I shall even then be so anxious to make; to\n     the endearments of a fond husband, of an impassioned lover; to\n     the envy and the homage of an admiring world. Suffer me rather,\n     dear lovely girl, to exult in the hope that you will receive,\n     without reluctance, the man to whom fate assigns you, and that\n     you will recal somewhat of the tenderness you once confessed\n     for your own ever-devoted,\n\n                               'VILLIERS HARGRAVE.'\n\n\n     LAURA'S ANSWER\n     (sent with the foregoing to Mrs Douglas:)\n\n     'I thought my spirit had been broken, crushed never more to\n     rise. Must the glow of indignation mingle with the damps of\n     death? But I will not upbraid you. The language of forgiveness\n     best befits me now. The measure of your injuries to me is\n     almost full; while those which you have heaped upon yourself\n     are yet more deep and irreparable. My blasted fame, my life\n     cut off in its prime, even the horrible dread that has\n     overwhelmed me, are nothing to the pangs of hopeless remorse,\n     the unaccepted struggle for repentance.--Yet a little while,\n     and this darkness shall burst into light ineffable. Yet a\n     little while, and this sorrow shall be as the remembrance of a\n     troubled dream. But you--Oh Hargrave, have pity on yourself!\n\n     'It was not to warn, it was to plead with you, that I won on my\n     knees the consent of your messenger to bear my reply. I will\n     strive to hope; for you were not always pitiless. I have seen\n     you feel for the sufferings of a stranger, and have you no\n     mercy for me? Alas! in those pitying tears I saw you shed,\n     began this long train of evil; for then began my base idolatry,\n     and justly have you been made the instrument of my punishment.\n\n     'My mind wanders. I am weaker than a child. Oh Hargrave, if you\n     have human pity let the feeble spark expire in peace. Here,\n     where no Christian footstep shall hallow the turf that covers\n     me, nor song of Christian praise rise near my grave, here let\n     me lay me down and die--and I will bless you that I die in\n     peace. I dare not spend my parting breath in uttering unholy\n     vows, nor die a voluntary partner in your crimes. Nor would I,\n     had my life been prolonged, have joined to pollution this dust,\n     which, perishable as it is, must rise to immortality--which,\n     vile as it is, more vile as it soon may be, shall yet \"put on\n     incorruption.\" Why then should you come hither? Will it please\n     you to see this poor piece of clay, for which you have ventured\n     your soul, faded to an object of horror?--cast uncoffined into\n     the earth, robbed of the decencies which Christians pay even to\n     the worst of sinners? When you look upon my stiffened corpse\n     will you then triumph in the security of your possession? Will\n     you again exult in hope when you turn from my grave and say,\n     \"here lies the wretch whom I have undone!\"\n\n     'Come not I charge you, if you would escape the anguish of the\n     murderer. When did the evil of your deeds stop within your\n     first intention? Do not amuse your conscience with the dream of\n     reparation. I am fallen indeed, ere you dare insult me with the\n     thought! Will you wed the dead? Or could I outlive your\n     injuries, think you that I would sink so low as to repay them\n     with myself?--reward with vows of love a crime more black than\n     murder! Though my name, already degraded through you, must no\n     more claim alliance with the good and worthy, think you that I\n     would bind myself before heaven to a wretch who owed his very\n     life to my undeserved mercy? Inhuman! Your insults have roused\n     the failing spirit. Yet I must quell these last stirrings of\n     nature. Instant, full, and free must be my forgiveness; for\n     such is the forgiveness which I shall soon require.\n\n     'Perhaps, as now you seem to think me fit for any baseness, you\n     will suppose my forebodings a poor deceit to win you from your\n     purpose. See then if you can trace in these unsteady lines the\n     vigour of health. Ask him who bears them to you, how looks now\n     the face which you call lovely? Ask him if the hand which gave\n     this letter looks soft and graceful now? I love to gaze upon\n     it. It bids me hope, for it is like no living thing. Inquire\n     minutely. Ask if there remains one charm to lure you on to\n     farther guilt. And if death has already seized on all, if he\n     has spared nothing to desire, will you yet hurry him on his\n     prey? You have made life a burden too heavy for the weary\n     frame. Will you make death too dreadful to be endured? Will you\n     add to its horrors till nature and religion shrink from it in\n     agony.\n\n     'I cannot plead with you as I would. My strength fails. My eyes\n     are dim with weeping. Oh grant that this farewell may be the\n     last--that we may meet no more till I welcome you with the joy\n     which angels feel over the sinner that repenteth.'\n\nThe whole of the night preceding Hargrave's arrival, was passed by Laura\nin acts of devotion. In her life, blameless as it had appeared to\nothers, she saw so much ground for condemnation, that, had her hopes\nrested upon her own merit, they would have vanished like the sunshine of\na winter storm. Their support was more mighty; and they remained\nunshaken. The raptures of faith beamed on her soul. By degrees they\ntriumphed over every fear; and the first sound that awoke the morning,\nwas her voice raised in a trembling hymn of praise.\n\nHer countenance elevated as in hope; her eyes cast upwards; her hands\nclasped; her lips half open in the unfinished adoration; her face\nbrightened with a smile, the dawn of eternal day--she was found by her\nattendant. Awe-struck, the woman paused, and at a reverend distance\ngazed upon the seraph; but her entrance had called back the unwilling\nspirit from its flight; and Laura, once more a feeble child of earth,\nfaintly inquired whether her enemy were at hand. Mary answered that her\nmaster was not expected to arrive before the evening; and entreated that\nLaura would try to recruit her spirits, and accept of some refreshment.\nLaura made no opposition. She unconsciously swallowed what was placed\nbefore her; unwittingly suffered her attendant to lead her abroad; nor\nonce heeded ought that was done to her, nor ought that passed before her\neyes, till her exhausted limbs found rest upon the trunk of a tree,\nwhich lay mouldering near the spot where its root was sending forth a\nluxuriant thicket.\n\nThe breath of morning blew chill on the wasted form of Laura, while it\nsomewhat revived her to strength and recollection. Her attendant seeing\nher shiver in the breeze, compassionately wrapped her more closely in\nher cloak, and ran to seek a warmer covering. 'She feels for my bodily\nwants,' said Laura. 'Will she have no pity for the sufferings of the\nsoul? Yet what relief can she afford: What help is there for me in man?\nOh be Thou my help who art the guard of the defenceless! Thou who canst\nshield in every danger--Thou who canst guide in every difficulty!'\n\nHer eye rested as it fell, upon a track as of recent footsteps. They had\nbrushed away the dew, and the rank grass had not yet risen from their\npressure. The unwonted trace of man's presence arrested her attention;\nand her mind, exhausted by suffering, and sharing the weakness of its\nfrail abode, admitted the superstitious thought that these marks\nafforded a providential indication for her guidance. Transient animation\nkindling in her frame, she followed the track as it wound round a\nthicket of poplar; then, suddenly recollecting herself, she became\nconscious of the delusion, and shed a tear over her mental decay.\n\nShe was about to return, when she perceived that she was near the bank\nof the river. Its dark flood was stealing noiseless by, and Laura,\nlooking on it, breathed the oft repeated wish that she could seek rest\nbeneath its waves. Again she moved feebly forward. She reached the brink\nof the stream, and stood unconsciously following its course with her\neye; when a light wind stirring the canes that grew down to the water\nedge, she beheld close by her an Indian canoe. With suddenness that\nmocks the speed of light, hope flashed on the darkened soul; and,\nstretching her arms in wild ecstasy, 'Help, help,' cried Laura, and\nsprung towards the boat. A feeble echo from the further shore alone\nreturned the cry. Again she called. No human voice replied. But\ndelirious transport lent vigour to her frame. She sprung into the bark;\nshe pressed the slender oar against the bank. The light vessel yielded\nto her touch. It floated. The stream bore it along. The woods closed\naround her prison. 'Thou hast delivered me!' she cried; and sunk\nsenseless.\n\nA meridian sun beat on her uncovered head ere Laura began to revive.\nRecollection stole upon her like the remembrance of a feverish dream. As\none who, waking from a fearful vision, still trembles in his joy, she\nscarcely dared to hope that the dread hour was past, till raising her\neyes she saw the dark woods bend over her, and steal slowly away as the\ncanoe glided on with the tide. The raptures of fallen man own their\nalliance with pain, by seeking the same expression. Joy and gratitude\ntoo big for utterance long poured themselves forth in tears. At length\nreturning composure permitting the language of extasy, it was breathed\nin the accents of devotion; and the lone wild echoed to a song of\ndeliverance.\n\nThe saintly strain rose unmixed with other sound. No breeze moaned\nthrough the impervious woods. No ripple broke the stream. The dark\nshadows trembled for a moment in its bosom as the little bark stole by,\nand then reposed again. No trace appeared of human presence. The fox\npeeping from the brushwood, the wild duck sailing stately in the stream,\nsaw the unwonted stranger without alarm, untaught as yet to flee from\nthe destroyer.\n\nThe day declined; and Laura, with the joy of her escape, began to mingle\na wish, that, ere the darkness closed around her, she might find shelter\nnear her fellow beings. She was not ignorant of the dangers of her\nvoyage. She knew that the navigation of the river was interrupted by\nrapids. A cataract which broke its course had been purposely described\nin her hearing. She examined her frail vessel and trembled; for life was\nagain become precious, and feeble seemed her defence against the\ntorrent. The canoe, which could not have contained more than two\npersons, was constructed of a slender frame of wood, covered with the\nbark of the birch. It yielded to the slightest motion, and caution was\nnecessary to poise in it even the light form of Laura.\n\nSlowly it floated down the lingering tide; and, when a pine of larger\nsize or form more fantastic than his fellows enabled her to measure her\nprogress, she thought that through wilds less impassible her own limbs\nwould have borne her more swiftly. In vain behind each tangled point did\nher fancy picture the haunt of man. Vainly amid the mists of eve did she\ntrace the smoke of sheltered cottages. In vain at every winding of the\nstream she sent forward a longing eye in search of human dwelling. The\nnarrow view was bounded by the dark wilderness, repeating ever the same\npicture of dreary repose.\n\nThe sun went down. The shadows of evening fell; not such as in her\nhappy native land blend softly with the last radiance of day; but black\nand heavy, harshly contrasting with the light of a naked sky reflected\nfrom the waters, where they spread beyond the gloom of impending woods.\nDark, and more dark the night came on. Solemn even amid the peopled\nland, in this vast solitude it became more awful. Ignorant how near the\nplace of danger might be, fearing to pursue darkling her perilous way,\nLaura tried to steer her light bark to the shore, intending to moor it,\nto find in it a rude resting place, and in the morning to pursue her\nway. Laboriously she toiled, and at length reached the bank in safety;\nbut in vain she tried to draw her little vessel to land. Its weight\nresisted her strength. Dreading that it should slip from her grasp and\nleave her without means of escape, she re-entered it, and again glided\non in her dismal voyage. She had found in the canoe a little coarse\nbread made of Indian corn; and this, with the water of the river, formed\nher whole sustenance. Her frame worn out with previous suffering, awe\nand fear at last yielded to fatigue; and the weary wanderer sunk to\nsleep.\n\nIt was late on the morning of a cloudy day, when a low murmuring sound\nstealing on the silence awoke Laura from the rest of innocence. She\nlistened. The murmur seemed to swell on her ear. She looked up. The dark\nwoods still bent over her. But they no longer touched the margin of the\nstream. They stretched their giant arms from the summit of a precipice.\nTheir image was no more reflected unbroken. The gray rocks which\nsupported them but half lent their colours to the rippling water. The\nwild duck, no longer tempting the stream, flew screaming over its bed.\nEach object hastened on with fearful rapidity, and the murmuring sound\nwas now a deafening roar.\n\nFear supplying super-human strength, Laura strove to turn the course of\nher vessel. She strained every nerve; she used the force of desperation.\nHalf-hoping that the struggle might save her, half-fearing to note her\ndreadful progress, she toiled on till the oar was torn from her\npowerless grasp, and hurried along with the tide.\n\nThe fear of death alone had not the power to overwhelm the soul of\nLaura. Somewhat might yet be done perhaps to avert her fate, at least to\nprepare for it. Feeble as was the chance of life, it was not to be\nrejected. Fixing her cloak more firmly about her, Laura bound it to the\nslender frame of the canoe. Then commending herself to heaven with the\nfervour of a last prayer, she, in dread stillness, awaited her doom.\n\nWith terrible speed the vessel hurried on. It was whirled round by the\ntorrent--tossed fearfully--and hurried on again. It shot over a\nsmoothness more dreadful than the eddying whirl. It rose upon its prow.\nLaura clung to it in the convulsion of terror. A moment she trembled on\nthe giddy verge. The next, all was darkness!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nWhen Laura was restored to recollection, she found herself in a plain\ndecent apartment. Several persons of her own sex were humanely busied in\nattending her. Her mind retaining a confused remembrance of the past,\nshe inquired where she was, and how she had been brought thither. An\nelderly woman, of a prepossessing appearance, answered with almost\nmaternal kindness, 'that she was among friends all anxious for her\nsafety; begged that she would try to sleep; and promised to satisfy her\ncuriosity when she should be more able to converse.' This benevolent\nperson, whose name was Falkland, then administered a restorative to her\npatient; and Laura, uttering almost incoherent expressions of gratitude,\ncomposed herself to rest.\n\nAwakening refreshed and collected, she found Mrs Falkland and one of her\ndaughters still watching by her bed-side. Laura again repeated her\nquestions, and Mrs Falkland fulfilled her promise, by relating that her\nhusband, who was a farmer, having been employed with his two sons in a\nfield which overlooked the river, had observed the canoe approach the\nfall; that seeing it too late to prevent the accident, they had hurried\ndown to the bed of the stream below the cataract, in hopes of\nintercepting the boat at its reappearance: That being accustomed to\nfloat wood down the torrent, they knew precisely the spot where their\nassistance was most likely to prove effectual: That the canoe, though\ncovered with foam for a moment, had instantly risen again, and that Mr\nFalkland and his sons had, not without danger, succeeded in drawing it\nto land. She then, in her turn, inquired by what accident Laura had been\nexposed to such a perilous adventure; expressing her wonder at the\ndirection of her voyage, since Falkland farm was the last inhabited spot\nin that district. Laura, mingling her natural reserve with a desire to\nsatisfy her kind hostess, answered, that she had been torn from her\nfriends by an inhuman enemy, and that her perilous voyage was the least\neffect of his barbarity. 'Do you know,' said Mrs Falkland, somewhat\nmistaking her meaning, 'that to his cruelty you partly owe your life;\nfor had he not bound you to the canoe, you must have sunk while the boat\nfloated on.' Laura heard with a faint smile the effect of her\nself-possession; but considering it as a call to pious gratitude rather\nthan a theme of self-applause, she forbore to offer any claim to praise;\nand suffered the subject to drop without further explanation.\n\nHaving remained for two days with this hospitable family, Laura\nexpressed a wish to depart. She communicated to Mr Falkland her desire\nof returning immediately to Europe; and begged that he would introduce\nher to some asylum where she might wait the departure of a vessel for\nBritain. She expressed her willingness to content herself with the\npoorest accommodation, confessing that she had not the means of\npurchasing any of a higher class. All the wealth, indeed, which she\ncould command, consisted in a few guineas which she had accidentally had\nabout her when she was taken from her home; and a ring which Mrs De\nCourcy had given her at parting. Her hosts kindly urged her to remain\nwith them till they should ascertain that a vessel was immediately to\nsail, in which she might secure her passage; assuring her that a week\nscarcely ever elapsed without some departure for her native country.\nFinding, however, that she was anxious to be gone, Mr Falkland himself\naccompanied her to Quebec. They travelled by land. The country at first\nbore the characters of a half redeemed wilderness. The road wound at\ntimes through dreary woods, at others through fields where noxious\nvariety of hue bespoke imperfect cultivation. At last it approached the\ngreat river; and Laura gazed with delight on the ever-changing, rich and\nbeautiful scenes which were presented to her view; scenes which she had\npassed unheeded when grief and fear veiled every prospect in gloom. One\nof the nuns in the Hotel Dieu was the sister of Mrs Falkland; and to her\ncare Mr Falkland intended to commit his charge. But before he had been\nan hour in the town, he received information that a ship was weighing\nanchor for the Clyde, and Laura eagerly embraced the opportunity. The\ncaptain being informed by Mr Falkland, that she could not advance the\nprice of her passage, at first hesitated to receive her; but when, with\nthe irresistible candour and majesty that shone in all her looks and\nwords, she assured him of his reward, when she spoke to him in the\naccents of his native land, the Scotsman's heart melted; and having\nsatisfied himself that she was a Highlander, he closed the bargain, by\nswearing that he was sure he might trust her. With tears in her eyes,\nLaura took leave of her benevolent host; yet her heart bounded with joy\nas she saw the vessel cleaving the tide, and each object in the dreaded\nland of exile swiftly retiring from her view. In a few days that dreaded\nland disappeared. In a few more the mountains of Cape Breton sunk behind\nthe wave. The brisk gales of autumn wafted the vessel cheerfully on her\nway; and often did Laura compute her progress.\n\nIn a clear frosty morning towards the end of September, she heard once\nmore the cry of land!--now music to her ear. Now with a beating breast\nshe ran to gaze upon a ridge of mountains indenting the disk of the\nrising sun; but the tears of rapture dimmed her eyes, when every voice\nat once shouted, 'Scotland!'\n\nAll day Laura remained on deck, oft measuring, with the light splinter,\nthe vessel's course through the deep. The winds favoured not her\nimpatience. Towards evening they died away, and scarcely did the vessel\nsteal along the liquid mirror. Another and another morning came, and\nLaura's ear was blessed with the first sounds of her native land. The\ntolling of a bell was borne along the water; now swelling loud, and now\nfalling softly away. The humble village church was seen on the shore;\nand Laura could distinguish the gay colouring of her country-women's\nSunday attire,--the scarlet plaid, transmitted from generation to\ngeneration, pinned decently over the plain clean coif,--the bright blue\ngown, the trophy of more recent housewifery. To her every form in the\nwell-known garb seemed the form of a friend. The blue mountains in the\ndistance,--the scattered woods,--the fields yellow with the\nharvest,--the river sparkling in the sun, seemed, to the wanderer\nreturning from the land of strangers, fairer than the gardens of\nParadise.\n\nLand of my affections!--when 'I forget thee, may my right hand forget\nher cunning!' Blessed be thou among nations! Long may thy wanderers\nreturn to thee rejoicing, and their hearts throb with honest pride when\nthey own themselves thy children!\n\nThe vessel at last cast anchor, and all was cheerful bustle; every one\neager to hurry ashore. Some hastened to launch the boat; some ran below\nto seek out the little offerings of love which they had brought for\ntheir friends. Never had Laura heard sound so animating as the cry of\n'all ready!' followed by the light short stroke of the oar that sent\nher swiftly forward. Many a wistful glance did the rowers turn. 'There's\nmother on the pier-head!' cried one. 'I see Annie and the bairns!' cried\nanother; and the oar was plied more swiftly. They landed. The shout of\njoy, and the whisper of affection were exchanged on every side. Laura\nstood back from the tumult, breathing a silent thanksgiving on behalf of\nherself and her companions. 'Poor lassie!' said the captain, approaching\nher, 'is there naebody to welcome thee? Come! I'm going up to Glasgow\nthe night to see my wife and the owners; and if ye like to gang wi' me,\nye'll be sae far on your way to your friends.' Laura thankfully accepted\nthe proposal; and the fly-boat being just about to sail up the river,\nshe placed in it the little packet of necessaries which she had\ncollected at Quebec; and accompanied the good-natured sailor to his\nhome.\n\nShe was kindly received by his wife and daughter, and furnished with the\nbest accommodations they could command. The next morning she gave the\ncaptain a draft for the price of her passage; and producing her purse\nand Mrs De Courcy's ring, offered them as further security; saying, that\nas she was now in her own country, a few shillings would support her\ntill she reached her friends, since she might travel to Perthshire on\nfoot. The sailor, however, positively refused to accept of any thing\nmore than the draft, swearing that if he were deceived in Laura, he\nwould never trust woman again. He then, at her desire, procured her a\nseat in the stage-coach, and once more she proceeded on her journey.\n\nAt a small village, a few miles from Perth, she desired to be set down.\nA by-road led from the village to Mr Douglas's parish. The distance was\nsaid to be only seven miles; and Laura, forgetting the latitude allowed\nto Scotish measurement, thought she might easily reach the parsonage\nbefore night-fall. Leaving her little parcel at the village, she\nhastened forward;--now pausing a moment as some well-known peak or cliff\nmet her eye, now bounding on with the light step of joy. She pictured\nthe welcome of affection; already she saw the mild countenance of her\nearly friend; already she felt the embrace of love.\n\nDarkness surprised her when she had yet much of her journey to perform,\nand had shrouded every object ere she reached the well-known gate, and\nsaw across the narrow lawn the lights streaming from the window. She\nstopped--fear stealing on her joy. In five months what changes might not\nhave happened! Her friend, her mother, might be ill, might be dead! So\nmust weak men mitigate with the prospect of evil the transports which\nbelong not to his inheritance! She again proceeded. She entered the\nhall. The parlour door was open. A group of cheerful faces appeared,\nruddy with youth and health; but Laura's eye rested on one of more\nmature, more interesting grace,--one shaded with untimely silver, and\nlighted up with milder fires. She remained motionless, fearing to\nsurprise her friend by too suddenly appearing, till one of the girls,\nobserving her, exclaimed, in a transport of joy, 'Laura! Mamma! Laura!'\nMrs Douglas sprung from her seat; and the welcome of affection, the\nembrace of love were reality!\n\nThe first burst of gladness was succeeded by the solicitous inquiry, by\nthe interesting narrative; and Laura beguiled her friend of many tears\nby the story of her sad voyage, her hopeless captivity, her perilous\nescape. Tears, too, of real bitterness rose to her eyes, at the thought\nthat, although she had escaped from the cruelty of her oppressor, yet\nits consequences must be lasting as her life; and that she was now\npouring her story perhaps into the only ear that would be open to her\nprotestations of innocence. But she would not cloud the hour of joy by\ncalling the attention of her friend to the shade that rested on her\nprospects; nor diminish her own gratitude for deliverance from more real\nmisfortune, by anticipating the scorns of the world. She uttered not the\nfaintest foreboding of evil, but continued with serene cheerfulness to\n'charm as she was wont to do,' till at a late hour the friendly party\nseparated for the night.\n\nWeary as she was, Laura could not rest. She had a task to perform too\npainful to be thought of with indifference. It was necessary to write to\nDe Courcy; and to damp all the pleasure which a knowledge of her safety\nwould convey, by retracting engagements which had been made when her\nalliance inferred no dishonour. She well knew that De Courcy himself,\nconvinced of her innocence, would spurn the idea of forsaking her in\nmisfortune,--of giving, by his desertion, a sanction to calumny. And\nshould she take advantage of his honour and his love to fix in his heart\nthe incurable anguish of following to the wife of his bosom the glance\nof suspicion or of scorn! The world's neglect was trivial in her\nestimation. Even its reproach might be endured by one who could appeal\nfrom its sentence to a higher tribunal. But what should ease the heart\nwhose best affections were turned to poison by domestic shame; the heart\njealous of the honour which it could not defend, bleeding at the stab\nfrom which it dared not recoil?\n\nLaura had already taken her resolution, and the next day saw it\neffected. She wrote to De Courcy, detailing minutely every event that\nhad befallen her from the hour of their separation till her landing in\nBritain. There her narrative closed. She told not in what spot the\nwanderer had found rest. She did not even intimate in what part of the\nisland she had disembarked, lest it should furnish a clue to her present\nretreat. Nor did she, by expressions of tenderness and regret, aggravate\nthe pang which she was compelled to inflict. In words like these she\nproceeded. 'And now, my respected friend, I imagine you are pausing to\noffer a thanksgiving for yourself and for me. Let it not damp your just\ngratitude that somewhat of evil is permitted to mingle with this signal\ndeliverance. Let not my escape from misfortune the most dreadful be\nforgotten, even though the world should refuse to believe in that\nescape. For thus it must be. Known to have been in the power of that bad\nman, will the harsh-judging world believe me innocent? Will it be\nbelieved that he ventured to cast his very life upon my mercy, by\ndragging me unwilling from my home? So long the sport of his ungoverned\npassions, will it be believed that I have not even seen him?\n\n'I know it will be difficult to convince you that an unjust sentence can\nbe pronounced against me. Certain yourself of the truth of my story, you\nimagine that it will find easy credence with others. But even if we\ncould change the nature of man, and teach strangers to judge with the\ncandour of friendship, who shall furnish them with the materials for\njudging? Not he, who, in corroborating my tale, must publish his own\ndisgrace! Not the weak Laura, who, by a constitutional defect, shrinks\neven from the eye where she cannot read distrust!\n\n'Consider all this, and you will at once perceive the reasons which\ninduce me to conceal myself from you for a time. Engagements formed\nunder circumstances now so materially changed I cannot consider as\nbinding. You, I fear, may think otherwise, and be hurried on by your\ngenerous nature to tempt a fate which that very turn of mind would\nrender insupportable. My own part in this fate I think I can bear. The\nshare which would fall upon you, I own would crush me to the dust. My\nspirits are not yet what they have been. I am weary of struggling with a\nperverse heart, ever leading me aside from duty. I will not lend it arms\nby exposing myself to entreaties and arguments to which I cannot yield\nwithout betraying my best friend to anguish unpitied and hopeless;\nanguish which would bear with double pressure on myself.\n\n'A stain is fallen on my good name, and \"the glory has departed from\nme.\" Be it so! He who doth all things well hath chosen my lot, and his\nchoice shall be mine. I trust I shall be enabled to act as becomes one\nwho is degraded in the public eye. I have sometimes shrunk from the\napprobation of the world--that little circle I mean which we are apt to\ncall the world. Now I will hide me from its censure; and shall find in\nthe duties which peculiarly belong to the fallen--the duties of\nhumility, of charity and of devotion--enough to make life still no\nunpleasing pilgrimage. A good name has been justly likened to a\njewel--precious, not necessary. But if you, my dear friend, covet fame\nfor me, look forward to the time when an assembled universe shall behold\nmy acquittal, when a Judge, before whom the assembled universe is as\nnothing, shall proclaim me for his own.'\n\nThis letter Laura accompanied with another, in which she begged Mrs De\nCourcy's assistance in reconciling her son to the change in his\nprospects. Both were inclosed by Mr Douglas to a friend in London, who\nwas directed to forward them by post; thus avoiding any trace of the\nquarter from whence they came.\n\nHer lot thus chosen, Laura began to make arrangements for entering on a\nmode of life befitting her situation. Fearing that the shaft of slander\nshould glance aside from herself to the friends who still clung to her,\nshe steadily resisted Mrs Douglas's warm invitations to make the\nparsonage her home. Her father's little farm at Glenalbert had been\nannexed to one of larger size. The cottage remained untenanted, and\nthither Laura determined to retire. Her fortune, however far from\naffluent, she thought would suffice to support the humble establishment\nwhich she meant to retain. One servant was sufficient for her who had\nbeen accustomed to make few claims on the assistance of others. To\nobviate the impropriety of living alone while yet extreme youth made\neven nominal protection valuable, she invited an elderly widow lady,\npoor, but respectable, to preside in her household. In necessary\npreparations for her removal to Glenalbert, in affectionate assiduities\nto the friends with whom she resided, in compensating to her own poor\nfor her long, though involuntary neglect of their claims, Laura sought a\nrefuge from painful reflection; and, if a sigh arose at the review of\nher altered prospects, she called to mind her deliverance, and regret\nwas exchanged for thankfulness. The vain might have bewailed a\nseclusion thus untimely, thus permanent; the worldly-minded might have\nmourned the forfeiture of earthly prosperity; any spirit unsupported by\nreligion must have sunk under unmerited disgrace, embittered by keen\nsense of shame and constitutional timidity. Laura was a Christian, and\nshe could even at times rejoice that the spirit of vanity was mortified,\nthe temptations of the world withdrawn; even where the blow was more\npainful, she humbly believed that it was necessary, and thankfully owned\nthat it was kind.\n\nThe arrangements for her new establishment were soon completed, and the\ntime came when Laura was to begin her life of seclusion. The day before\nher intended removal she completed her twentieth year; and Mrs Douglas\nwould have assembled a little group of friends to celebrate the\noccasion, but Laura steadily opposed it. 'Let not one who is suspected,'\nsaid she, 'assume the boldness of innocence! yet since the suspicion\nwrongs me I will not wear the melancholy of guilt. Give the children a\nholiday for my sake, and I shall be as playful and as silly as the\nyoungest of them.' The holiday was granted; and Laura, amidst the joyful\nnoisy little company that soon assembled round her, forgot that she was\nan outcast.\n\nShe was busily searching every corner for the hidden handkerchief, the\nlittle rogue who had concealed it in his shoe laughing the while and\nclapping his hands in delight, when she started at the voice of a\nstranger in the lobby; who was announcing that he had a letter for Mrs\nDouglas, which he could deliver to no person but herself. The next\nmoment the stranger was shewn in to the room, and Laura with amazement\nbeheld her American attendant. The amazement on his part was still\ngreater. He started, he trembled, he at first shrunk from Laura, then\neagerly advancing towards her, 'Bless my soul, Madam!' he exclaimed,\n'are you alive? Then Mary's words are true, and the angels watch over\nyou.'\n\nIt was some time before the man's astonishment would permit him to\ndeclare his errand. At last when his curiosity had been partially\nsatisfied, he was prevailed upon to enter his narrative. 'You may\nremember, Madam,' said he, addressing himself to Laura, 'it was the\nmorning we expected my master, (though I told Mary, for a make-believe,\nthat he would not come till evening,) that morning Mary took you out and\nleft you; for which I was mortal angry with her, for my mind misgave me\nthat some mischief would come of it. So she ran down to the place where\nshe left you sitting, but you were not there. Then she looked all about,\nbut she could see you nowhere. She was afraid to go among the canes,\nfor fear of the rattlesnakes, so she ran home and told me. So I went\nwith her, scolding her to be sure all the way. Well we sought and\nsought, till at last, half in the water, and half on the shore, we found\nyour hat and then to be sure none of us never doubted that you had\ndrowned yourself; and Mary cried and wrung her hands like a distracted\ncreature, saying that my master was a wicked wretch that had broken your\nheart, and often and often she wished that we could find you to give you\nChristian burial, for she said she was sure your ghost would never let\nher rest in her bed. But we had no drags, nor anything to take you up\nwith out of the water. Well, we were just in the midst of all our\ntroubles when my master came. \"Well, Robert,\" says he, in his hearty\nway, \"Where is my angel?\" I had not the heart to say a word; so with\nthat Mary ran forward sobbing like a baby, and says she, just off hand,\n\"Miss Montreville is in a watery grave, and I am sure, Sir, some heavy\njudgment will light on him that drove her to it.\" So my master stood for\na moment thunderstruck, as it were, and then he flew upon us both like a\ntiger, and shook us till he scarce left breath in us, and swore that it\nwas all a trick, and that he would make us produce you or he would have\nour lives. So I tried to pacify him the best I could; but Mary answered\nhim, that it was all his own doing, and that he might seek you in the\nriver where he would find your corpse. This put my master quite beside\nhimself; and he catched her up, and flung her from him, just as if she\nhad been a kitten; and then he flew down to the river side, and I\nfollowed him, and shewed him where we had found your hat; and explained\nto him how it was not our fault, for we had both been very civil and\ngiven you no disturbance at all, which you know Madam was true. So,\nclose to the place where we found your hat we saw the print of your\nlittle shoe in the bank; and when my master saw it he grew quite\ndistracted, crying out that he had murdered you, and that he would\nrevenge you upon a wretch not fit to live (meaning himself, Madam), and\nso he would have leaped into the river; but by this time one of the\nservants he brought with him came up, and we forced him back to the\nhouse. Then he grew more quiet; and called for Mary, and gave her his\npurse with all his money, and bid her tell every thing about you, Madam;\nhow you had behaved, and what you had said. So she told him, crying all\nthe while, for she repented from her heart that ever she consented to\nhave any hand in the business. And sometimes he would start away and\ngnash his teeth, and dash his head against the wall; and sometimes he\nwould bid her go on, that he might run distracted at once and forget\nall. So she told him that you had written to one Mrs Douglas, in hopes\nthat when you were dead he would take pity on you, (repeating your very\nwords, Madam). Then he asked to see the letter, and he carried it into\nyour room. And there we heard him groaning and speaking to himself, and\nthrowing himself against the walls; and we thought it best to let him\ncome to himself a little and not disturb him. So by and by he called for\npen and ink, and I carried them to him, thinking if he wanted to write\nit was a sign he was growing more calm. Then he continued writing for\nsome time, though now and again we heard him restless as before. At last\nhe opened the door, and called me, \"Robert,\" says he, quite calm and\ncomposed like, \"if you deliver this packet as directed, you will earn\nthree hundred pounds. But be sure to deliver it with your own hand.\" I\nwas going to ask him something more about it, for I did not just know\nwhat he meant about the \u00c2\u00a3300; but he pushed me out, and shut himself\ninto the room. Then I bethought myself that there was something strange\nlike in his look, and that he was pale, and somehow not like himself. So\nI went to the kitchen to consult with the rest what we had best do. So I\nhad scarcely got there when I heard a pistol go off, and we all ran and\nburst open the door, and there we saw my master, Madam, laid out upon\nMiss Montreville's bed, and the pistol still in his hand; though he was\nstone dead, Madam, for I suppose the ball had gone right through his\nheart.'\n\nLaura, dreadfully shocked, and no longer able to listen to this horrible\nrelation, hastened out of the room, leaving Mrs Douglas to hear what yet\nremained to be told of the history of a man of pleasure!!! The servant\nproceeded to tell that he and his companions had conveyed their master's\nbody to head-quarters, had seen it buried with military honours, and\nthen had sailed in the first ship for Britain. That remembering the\ncharge to deliver the packet with his own hand, he had come down to\nScotland on purpose to execute his trust; and hoped that Mrs Douglas\nwould fulfil his master's promise. He then delivered the packet, which\nMrs Douglas opening in his presence, found to contain a bill for \u00c2\u00a3300 in\nfavour of Robert Lewson, not payable without her signature; the two\nletters which Laura had written during her exile; and the following\nlines, rendered almost illegible by the convulsive startings of the hand\nwhich traced them.\n\n     'The angel whom I have murdered, was an angel still. \"The\n     destroyer came,\" but found her not. It was her last wish that\n     you should know her innocence. None can attest it like me. She\n     was purer than heaven's own light. She loved you. There is\n     another, too, whom she protests that she loved to the last--but\n     it was me alone whom she loved with passion. In the anguish of\n     her soul she called it \"idolatry;\" and the words of agony are\n     true. But I, like a base fool, cast her love away for the\n     heartless toyings of a wanton! And shall I, who might have been\n     so blest, live now to bear the gnawings of this viper--this\n     hell never to be escaped?\n\n     'She has said that she must go to the grave laden with shame;\n     that her name is degraded through me. Once more, then, I charge\n     you, proclaim her innocence. Let no envious tongue presume to\n     stain that name. Let it be accounted holy. I will save what she\n     loved better than life, though I have persecuted her--driven\n     her to death--forced her to hide in the cold waters all that\n     was loveliest in woman. She says that she will meet you in\n     heaven,--and it must be true, for falsehood was a stranger to\n     her lips. Then tell her that he who was her murderer, was her\n     avenger too. It is said that self-destruction is the\n     last--worst crime. In others it may be so. In me it is but\n     justice; for every law condemns the murderer to die. He who\n     destroyed that angel should die a thousand deaths. Justice\n     shall be speedy.\n\n                              'VILLIERS HARGRAVE.'\n\nMrs Douglas had no sooner read the contents of her packet, than she\nhastened to communicate them to Laura. The horror inspired by Hargrave's\nletter, and the dreadful destiny of the writer, did not render her\ninsensible to the pleasure of being empowered to clear, beyond a doubt,\nthe fame of her young friend. Laura was, however, for the present, in no\nstate to share her joy. She could only weep; and, trembling, pray that\nshe might be enabled to guard against the first beginnings of that\nself-indulgence, whose end is destruction!\n\nMrs Douglas at last found means to rouse her by naming De Courcy, and\nreminding her of his right to immediate information of this happy change\nin her situation. Laura, as superior to coquetry as to any other species\nof despicable cruelty, instantly sat down to communicate the news to her\nlover. To her plain unvarnished tale, she added copies of the letters\nwhich attested her innocence, with Lewson's account of the names and\naddresses of those persons who had been employed to carry her from\nEngland.\n\nEvening was drawing on before Laura had finished her task; and, desirous\nto recruit her spirits before she joined the family circle, she stole\nabroad to breathe the reviving air of her native hills. She had crossed\nthe little lawn, and was opening the gate, when, seeing a carriage drive\nquickly up, she drew back. The carriage stopped. She heard an\nexclamation of joy, and the next moment she was pressed to the heart of\nDe Courcy.\n\nLaura first recovered utterance. 'What happy chance,' she cried, 'has\nbrought you here just at the moment when I am permitted to rejoice that\nyou are come?' 'Ah, Laura,' said De Courcy, 'could I know that you were\nalive and in Britain, yet make no effort to find you? I was convinced\nthat Mrs Douglas must know your retreat. I was sure that I could plead\nso that no human heart could resist my entreaties. And now I have found\nthee, I will never leave thee but with life.'\n\nThe little shrubbery walk which led round the lawn to the parsonage was\nnot half a quarter of a mile in length, yet it was an hour before the\nlovers reached the house; and before Laura presented De Courcy to her\nfriends she had promised that in one week she would reward his tried\naffection; and had settled, that after they had spent a few days in\ndelightful solitude at Glenalbert, she would accompany him to Norwood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLaura has now been for some years a wife; and the same qualities which\nmade her youth respectable, endear her to the happy partner of her\nmaturer life. She still finds daily exercise for her characteristic\nvirtue; since even amidst the purest worldly bliss self-denial is\nnecessary. But the tranquil current of domestic happiness affords no\nmaterials for narrative. The joys that spring from chastened affection,\ntempered desires, useful employment, and devout meditation, must be\nfelt--they cannot be described.\n\n\n                      THE END.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nTranscribers Notes:\n\n    Some minor obvious typographical errors have been corrected\n    silently.\n\n    The footnote has been moved to underneath the paragraph it\n    refers to so as to not disrupt the flow of the text.\n\n    All inconsistent hyphenation, apostrophes and single quotes have\n    been left as found unless noted.\n\n\nCorrections made are shown below in square brackets:\n\n    Pg. 2 \"She understood all the arts of courtesey[courtesy]\"\n\n    Pg. 16 \"to unit[unite] myself with vice\"\n\n    Pg. 19 \"My dear kind feather[father],' she cried,\"\n\n    Pg. 21 \"features indeliby[indelibly] engraven on her\n    recollection\"\n\n    Pg. 23 \"Soon after she first saw Hargraves[Hargrave]\"\n\n    Pg. 24 \"the cause of Laura's depresion[depression]\"\n\n    Pg. 41 \"Hargraves[Hargrave] was the only child\"\n\n    Pg. 66 \"and she run[ran] on till she was\"\n\n    Pg. 108 \"triumphantly, [']for haven't I read it\"\n\n    Pg. 127 \"Varius[Various] circumstances, however, had led De\n    Courcy\"\n\n    Pg. 135 \"must have a companion to it.[']\"\n\n    Pg. 198 \"was leaving the shop, goodnaturedly[good-naturedly]\n    said\"\n\n    Pg. 219 \"she should inhabit so lovely, so peaceful [a] scene.\"\n\n    Pg. 224 \"Hargrave could not possibility[possibly] refuse to\n    fight\"\n\n    Pg. 225 \"the close of a sleepness[sleepless] night\"\n\n    Pg. 233 \"'That you have no ambition,' replied [Mrs] De Courcy,\"\n\n    Pg. 237 \"twenty times before.--[']\"Always live with a\"\n\n    Pg. 247 \"'I think,' said [Mrs] De Courcy, 'I can observe\"\n\n    Pg. 249 \"Then I was gong[going] to have got\"\n\n    Pg. 253 \"namely, the liberty to infrine[infringe]\"\n\n    Pg. 264 \"Montague [who] looks so provokingly pleased\"\n\n    Pg. 306 \"'Do you dare to tell you[replaced with \"me\"] that you\n    will not go?'\"\n\n    Pg. 313 \"Laura's habitual ascendancy was completed[completely]\n    restored\"\n\n    Pg. 343 \"instead of cards, prefer[prefers] allowing me to attend\n    her\"\n\n    Pg. 347 \"through every tedious hours[hour] in which the absence\n    of visitors\"\n\n\nMultiple versions of words not changed:\n\n    bridemaid, bride-maid\n    control, controul\n    couldn't, could'nt\n    extasy, ecstasy\n    might'nt, mightn't, might'n't\n    mustn't, must'nt\n    print-seller, printseller\n    recal, recall\n    superstitution, superstition\n    surprise, surprize\n    suspence, suspense\n    t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate, t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate\n    tonight, to-night\n    tremor, tremour\n    wasn't, was'nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Self-control, by Mary Brunton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SELF-CONTROL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 41196-8.txt or 41196-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/1\/1\/9\/41196\/\n\nProduced by Delphine Lettau, fh and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1323,"split":"test"}
