{"ori_id":"964b0f4d342647ea243f1e1156c2e691ff34e6e4","title":"Regiment of Women","context":"Regiment of Women\n Set in a small town in Edwardian England, Regiment of Women is about the relationship between two teachers at a private (and elitist) girls' school. One of them, Clare Hartill, is in her mid-thirties and runs the school in all but name, the ageing and sickly headmistress depending on her whenever a decision has to be taken concerning the school or any of its pupils. Most of the girls are devoted to Hartill and gladly suffer under her strict but charismatic rule and the loads of homework she sets them, mainly to prove to her and to themselves that they are more academically advanced than she told them they were. Hartill lives alone near the school in a small, old-fashioned flat full of books but without gas or electricity.\nThe other teacher is Alwynne Durand, an attractive nineteen-year-old woman without any formal training who lives with Elsbeth Loveday, her unmarried aunt and guardian. When Durand starts teaching at the school she is immediately popular with her students but also excites Hartill's attention \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just because the young mistress is as enthusiastic about teaching as herself, but also because Hartill is always on the lookout for companionship. The two women become close friends, and Durand spends more and more of her spare time in Hartill's flat, occasionally not returning to her aunt's for days. The couple also travel abroad together during the summer holidays. Although Loveday and Hartill hardly ever meet, a strange kind of antagonism develops between them, each woman fighting to spend more time than they do with Alwynne Durand and to be the dominant person in Alwynne's life.\nIn the course of the schoolyear one of Hartill's prot\u0102\u0160g\u0102\u0160es, an unfortunate fourteen-year-old called Louise who has disappointed Hartill by failing an important exam, commits suicide by jumping from an upper floor window of the school building. The suicide is successfully hushed up, pronounced a case of accidental death, and quickly forgotten. What Hartill deliberately fails to mention, however, is that Louise's death, which happened on the night of the school play, was apparently triggered by her harsh criticism of Louise's excellent performance in the play. In the months that follow, Hartill even manages to shift the burden of guilt onto Durand's shoulders, persuading the young mistress that she ought to have detected any suicidal tendencies in Louise while giving her extra lessons.\nHartill's increasingly bizarre and offensive behaviour and her naive niece's growing dependence on her older friend call Elsbeth Loveday to action. When, on top of her shattered nerves, Alwynne Durand comes down with the flu, Loveday insists on her not returning to school for the rest of the term and on recuperating from her illness in the country instead. Alwynne agrees, if reluctantly at first, to spend some time with distant relatives she has never met before. The idyllic spring landscape she encounters after leaving town actually soothes her nerves, and Alwynne grows more and more fond of country life and the people she meets in her new surroundings.\nBut Elsbeth Loveday's scheme includes more than her niece's mere convalescence. As planned by her aunt, Alwynne Durand finds a confidant, and secret admirer, in thirty-year-old Roger Lumsden, a good-hearted, intelligent and handsome man who runs his own gardening business. Completely inexperienced with men except for what she has read in novels, Alwynne does not recognise her feelings for Lumsden as love, and she still looks forward to her reunion with Hartill. When she eventually returns to her home town, Lumsden follows her, proposes to her, and, naturally, is rejected. Only when Hartill, too sure of her seemingly inseparable bond with Alwynne, continues treating her badly does Alwynne wake up to reality. She sends Hartill a telegram telling her she has taken the train to the country in order to get married.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Regiment of Women, by Clemence Dane\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

D.\n\n\n\n\nREGIMENT OF WOMEN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThe school secretary pattered down the long corridor and turned into a\nclass-room.\n\nThe room was a big one. There were old-fashioned casement windows and\ndistempered walls; the modern desks, ranged in double rows, were small\nand shallow, scarred, and incredibly inky. In the window-seats stood an\nover-populous fish-bowl, two trays of silkworms, and a row of\nexperimental jam-pots. There were pictures on the walls--_The Infant\nSamuel_ was paired with _Cherry Ripe_, and Alfred, in the costume of\nRobin Hood, conscientiously ignored a neat row of halfpenny buns. The\nform was obviously a low one.\n\nThrough the opening door came the hive-like hum of a school at work, but\nthe room was empty, save for a mistress sitting at the raised desk,\nidle, hands folded, ominously patient. A thin woman, undeveloped,\nsallow-skinned, with a sensitive mouth, and eyes that were bold and\nshining.\n\nThey narrowed curiously at sight of the new-comer, but she was greeted\nwith sufficient courtesy.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Vigers?\"\n\nHenrietta Vigers was spare, precise, with pale, twitching eyes and a\nhigh voice. Her manner was self-sufficient, her speech deliberate and\nunnecessarily correct: her effect was the colourless obstinacy of an\nelderly mule. She stared about her inquisitively.\n\n\"Miss Hartill, I am looking for Milly Fiske. Her mother has\ntelephoned----Where is the class? I can't be mistaken. It's a quarter\nto one. You take the Lower Third from twelve-fifteen, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clare Hartill.\n\n\"Well, but--where is it?\" The secretary frowned suspiciously. She was\ninstinctively hostile to what she did not understand.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Clare sweetly.\n\nHenrietta gaped. Clare, justly annoyed as she was, could not but be\ngrateful to the occasion for providing her with amusement. She enjoyed\nbaiting Henrietta.\n\n\"I should have thought you could tell me. Don't you control the\ntime-table? I only know\"--her anger rose again--\"that I have been\nwaiting here since a quarter past twelve. I have waited quite long\nenough, I think. I am going home. Perhaps you will be good enough to\nenquire into the matter.\"\n\n\"But haven't you been to look for them?\" began Henrietta perplexedly.\n\n\"No,\" said Clare. \"I don't, you know. I expect people to come to me. And\nI don't like wasting my time.\" Then, with a change of tone, \"Really,\nMiss Vigers, I don't know whose fault it is, but it has no business to\nhappen. The class knows perfectly well that it is due here. You must see\nthat I can't run about looking for it.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course!\" Henrietta was taken aback. \"But I assure you\nthat it's nothing to do with me. I have rearranged nothing. Let me\nsee--who takes them before you?\"\n\nClare shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"How should I know? I hardly have time for my own classes----\"\n\nHenrietta broke in excitedly.\n\n\"It's Miss Durand! I might have known. Miss Durand, naturally. Miss\nHartill, I will see to the matter at once. It shall not happen again. I\nwill speak to Miss Marsham. I might have known.\"\n\n\"Miss Durand?\" Clare's annoyance vanished. She looked interested and a\ntrifle amused. \"That tall girl with the yellow hair? I've heard about\nher. I haven't spoken to her yet, but the children approve, don't they?\"\nShe laughed pointedly and Henrietta flushed. \"I rather like the look of\nher.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" Henrietta smiled sourly. \"I can't agree. A most unsuitable\nperson. Miss Marsham engaged her without consulting me--or you either, I\nsuppose? The niece or daughter or something, of an old mistress. I\nwonder you didn't hear--but of course you were away the first fortnight.\nA terrible young woman--boisterous--undignified--a bad influence on the\nchildren!\"\n\nClare's eyes narrowed again.\n\n\"Are you sure? The junior classes are working quite as well as\nusual--better indeed. I've been surprised. Of course, to-day----\"\n\n\"To-day is an example. She has detained them, I suppose. It has happened\nbefore--five minutes here--ten there--every one is complaining.\nReally--I shall speak to Miss Marsham.\"\n\n\"Of course, if that's the case, you had better,\" said Clare, rather\nimpatiently, as she moved towards the door. She regretted the impulse\nthat had induced her to explain matters to Miss Vigers. If it did not\nsuit her dignity to go in search of her errant pupils, still less did it\naccord with a complaint to the fidgety secretary. She should have\nmanaged the affair for herself. However--it could not be helped....\nHenrietta Vigers was looking important.... Henrietta Vigers would enjoy\nbaiting the new-comer--what was her name--Durand? Miss Durand would\nsubmit, she supposed. Henrietta was a petty tyrant to the younger\nmistresses, and Clare Hartill was very much aware of the fact. But the\nyounger mistresses did not interest her; she was no more than idly\ncontemptuous of their flabbiness. Why on earth had none of them appealed\nto the head mistress? But the new assistant was a spirited-looking\ncreature.... Clare had noticed her keen nostrils--nothing sheepish\nthere.... And Henrietta disliked her--distinctly a point in her\nfavour.... Clare suspected that trouble might yet arise.... She paused\nuncertainly. Even now she might herself interfere.... But Miss Durand\nhad certainly had no right to detain Clare's class.... It was gross\ncarelessness, if not impertinence.... Let her fight it out with Miss\nVigers.... Nevertheless--she wished her luck....\n\nWith another glance at her watch, and a cool little nod to her\ncolleague, she left the class-room, and was shortly setting out for her\nwalk home.\n\nHenrietta looked after her with an angry shrug.\n\nFor the hundredth time she assured herself that she was submitting\npositively for the last time to the dictates of Clare Hartill; that such\nusurpation was not to be borne.... Who, after all, had been Authority's\nright hand for the last twenty years? Certainly not Clare Hartill....\nWhy, she could recall Clare's first term, a bare eight years ago! She\nhad disliked her less in those days; had respected her as a woman who\nknew her business.... The school had been going through a lean year,\nwith Miss Marsham, the head mistress, seriously ill; with a weak staff,\nand girls growing riotous and indolent. So lean a year, indeed, that\nHenrietta, left in charge, had one day taken a train and her troubles to\nBournemouth, and poured them out to Authority's bath-chair. And Edith\nMarsham, the old warhorse, had frowned and nodded and chuckled, and sent\nher home again, no wiser than she came. But a letter had come for her\nlater, and the bearer had been a quiet, any-aged woman with disquieting\neyes. They had summed Henrietta up, and Henrietta had resented it. The\nnew assistant, given, according to instructions, a free hand, had gone\nabout her business, asking no advice. But there had certainly followed a\npeaceful six months. Then had come speech-day and Henrietta's world had\nturned upside down. She had not known such a speech-day for years.\nComplacent parents had listened to amazingly efficient performances--the\nguest of honour had enjoyed herself with obvious, na\u00c3\u00afve surprise: there\nhad been the bomb-shell of the lists. Henrietta had nothing to do with\nthe examinations, but she knew such a standard had not been reached for\nmany a long term. And the head mistress, restored and rubicund, had\nalluded to her, Henrietta's, vice-regency in a neat little speech. She\nhad received felicitations, and was beginning, albeit confusedly, to\npersuade herself that the stirring of the pie had been indeed due to her\nown forefinger, when the guests left, and she had that disturbing little\ninterview with her principal.\n\nEdith Marsham had greeted her vigorously. She was still in her prime\nthen, old as she was. She had another six years before senility,\nstriking late, struck heavily.\n\n\"Well--what do you think of her, eh? I hope you were a good girl--did as\nshe told you?\"\n\nHenrietta had flushed, resenting it that Miss Marsham, certainly a head\nmistress of forty years' standing, should, as she aged, treat her staff\nmore and more as if it were but a degree removed from the Upper Sixth.\nThe younger women might like it, but it did not accord with Henrietta's\nnotions of her own dignity. She was devoutly thankful that Miss Marsham\nreserved her freedom for private interviews; had, in public at least,\nthe grand manner. Yet she had a respect for her; knew her dimly for a\nnotable dame, who could have coerced a recalcitrant cabinet as easily as\nshe bullied the school staff.\n\nShe had rubbed her hands together, shrewd eyes a-twinkle.\n\n\"I knew what I was doing! How long have you been with me, Henrietta?\nTwelve years ago, eh? Ah, well, it's longer ago than that. Let me\nsee--she's twenty-eight now, Clare Hartill--and she left me at sixteen.\nA responsibility, a great responsibility. An orphan--too much money. A\ndifficult child--I spent a lot of time on her, and prayer, too, my dear.\nWell, I don't regret it now. When I met her at Bournemouth that day--oh,\nI wasn't pleased with you, Henrietta! It has taken me forty years to\nbuild up my school, and I can't be ill two months, but----Well, I made\nup my mind. I found her at a loose end. I talked to her. She'll take\nplain speaking from me. I told her she'd had enough of operas and art\nschools, and literary societies (she's been running round Europe for the\nlast ten years). I told her my difficulty--I told her to come back to me\nand do a little honest work. Of course she wouldn't hear of it.\"\n\n\"Then how did you persuade Miss Hartill?\"\n\nBut Henrietta, raising prim brows, had but drawn back a chuckle from the\nold woman.\n\n\"How many types of schoolgirl have you met, Henrietta? Here, under me?\"\n\nHenrietta fidgeted. The question was an offence. It was not in her\ndepartment. She had no note of it in her memorandum books.\n\n\"Really--I can hardly tell you--blondes and brunettes, do you mean? No\ntwo girls are quite the same, are they?\"\n\nBut Miss Marsham had not attended.\n\n\"Just two--that's my experience. The girl from whom you get work by\ntelling her you are sure she can do it--and the girl from whom you get\nwork by telling her you are sure she can't. You'll soon find out which I\ntold Clare Hartill. And now, understand this, Henrietta. There are to be\nno dissensions. I want Clare Hartill to stay. If she gets engrossed in\nthe work, she will. She won't interfere with you, you'll find. She's too\nlazy. Get on with her if you can.\"\n\nBut Henrietta had not got on with her, had resented fiercely Miss\nMarsham's preferential treatment of the new-comer. That Miss Marsham was\nobviously wise in her generation did not appease her _amour propre_. She\nknew that where she had failed, Clare had been uncannily successful. Yet\nClare was not aggressively efficient: indeed it was a grievance that she\nwas so apparently casual, so gracefully indifferent. But, as if it were\na matter of course, she did whatever she set out to do so much better,\nso much more graphically than it had ever been done before, that\ninevitably she attracted disciples. But Henrietta's grievance went\ndeeper. She denied her any vestige of personal charm, and at the same\ntime insisted fiercely that she was an unscrupulous woman, in that she\nused her personal charm to accomplish her aims: her aims, in Henrietta's\neyes, being the ousting of the secretary from her position of trust and\npossible succession to the headship. Henrietta did not realise that it\nwas herself, far more than Clare, who was jeopardising that position.\nThough there was no system of prefecture among the staff, she had come\nto consider herself responsible for the junior mistresses, encouraging\nthem to bring complaints to her, rather than to the head of the school.\nOld Miss Marsham, little as she liked relaxing her hold on the reins,\ndreaded, as old age must, the tussle that would inevitably follow any\ninsistence on her prerogatives, and had acquiesced; yet with\nreservations. Had one of the younger mistresses rebelled and carried her\ngrievance to the higher court, Miss Vigers' eyes might have been opened;\nbut as yet no one had challenged her self-assumed supremacy. Clare, who\nmight have done so, cared little who supervised the boarders or was\nsupreme in the matter of time-table and commissariat. Her interest lay\nin the actual work, in the characters and possibilities of the workers.\nThere she brooked no interference, and Henrietta attempted little, for\nwhen she did she was neatly and completely routed.\n\nBut the more chary Henrietta grew of interfering with Clare's\nactivities, the more she realised that it was her duty (she would not\nhave said pleasure) to supervise the younger women. She had a gift that\nwas almost genius of appearing among them at awkward moments. If a child\nwere proving refractory and victory hanging in the balance, Miss Vigers\nwould surely choose that moment to knock at the class-room door, and,\npolitely refusing to inconvenience the embarrassed novice, wait,\nall-observant, until the scene ended, before explaining her errand.\nLater in the day the young mistress would be button-holed, and the i's\nand t's of her errors of judgment dotted and crossed. Those who would\nnot submit to tutelage she contrived to render so uncomfortable that,\nsooner or later, they retired in favour of temperaments more sheeplike\nor more thick-skinned.\n\nTo Alwynne Durand, at present under grave suspicion of tampering with\nClare Hartill's literature class, she had been from the first inimical.\nShe had been engaged without Henrietta's sanction; she was young, and\npretty, and already ridiculously popular. And there was the affair of\nthe nickname. Alwynne had certainly looked out of place at the\nmistresses' table, on the day of her arrival, with her yellow hair and\ngreen gown--\"like a daffodil stuck into a bunch of everlastings,\" as an\nearly adorer had described her. The phrase had appealed and spread, and\nwithin a week she was \"Daffy\" to the school; but her popularity among\nher colleagues had not been heightened by rumours of the collective\nnickname the contrast with their junior had evoked. Her obvious shyness\nand desire to please were, however, sufficiently disarming, and her\nfirst days had not been made too difficult for her by any save\nHenrietta. But Henrietta was sure she was incompetent--called to witness\nher joyous, casual manner, her unorthodox methods, her way of submerging\nthe mistress in the fellow-creature. She had labelled her\nundisciplined--which Alwynne certainly was--lax and undignified; had\nprophesied that she would be unable to maintain order; had been annoyed\nto find that, inspiring neither fear nor awe, she was yet quite capable\nof making herself respected. Alwynne's jolliness never seemed to expose\nher to familiarities, ready as she was to join in the laugh against\nherself when, new to the ways of the school, she outraged Media, or\nreduced Persia to hysterical giggles. She was soon reckoned up by the\nshrewd children as \"mad, but a perfect dear,\" and she managed to make\nher governance so enjoyable that it would have been considered bad form,\nas well as bad policy, to make her unconventionality an excuse for\nragging. She had, indeed, easily assimilated the school atmosphere. She\nwas humble and anxious to learn, had no notions of her own importance.\nBut she was quick-tempered, and though she could be meek and grateful to\nexperience backed by good manners, she reared at patronage. Inevitably\nshe made mistakes, the mistakes of her age and temperament, but common\nsense and good humour saved her from any serious blunders.\n\nMiss Vigers had, nevertheless, noted each insignificant slip, and\ncarried the tale, less insignificant in bulk, in her mind, ready to\nproduce at a favourable opportunity.\n\nAnd now the opportunity had arisen. Miss Hartill had delivered Miss\nDurand into her hand. Miss Hartill, she was glad to note, had not shown\nany interest in the new-comer.... Miss Hartill had a way of taking any\none young and attractive under her protection.... That it was with Miss\nHartill that the girl had come into conflict, however, did away with any\nneed of caution.... Miss Durand needed putting in her place....\nHenrietta, in all speed, would reconduct her thither.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nMiss Vigers hurried along to the Upper Third class-room. She\nstraightened her jersey, and patted her netted hair as she went, much in\nthe manner of a countryman squaring for a fight, opened the door, after\na tap so rudimentary as to be inaudible to those within, and entered\naggressively, the light of battle in her eye.\n\nTo her amazement and annoyance her entry was entirely unnoticed. The\nentire class had deserted its desks and was clustered round the rostrum,\nwhere Alwynne Durand, looking flushed and excited and prettier than a\nschool-mistress had any business to be, was talking fast and eagerly.\nShe had a little stick in her hand which she was using as a conductor's\nbaton, emphasising with it the points of the story she was evidently\ntelling. A map and some portraits were pinned to the blackboard beside\nher, and the children's heads were grouped, three and four together,\nover pictures apparently taken from the open portfolio lying before her\non the desk. But their eyes were on Miss Durand, and the varying yet\nintent attitudes gave the collective effect of an audience at a\nmelodrama. They were obviously and breathlessly interested, and the\noccasional quick crackle of question and answer merely accentuated the\ntension. Once, as Alwynne paused a moment, her stick hovering\nuncertainly over the map, a child, with a little wriggle of impatience,\npiped up--\n\n\"We'll find it afterwards. Oh, go on, Miss Durand! Please, go on!\"\n\nAnd Alwynne, equally absorbed, went on and the class hung upon her\nwords.\n\nThe listener was outraged. Children were to be allowed to give\norders--to leave their places--to be obviously and hugely enjoying\nthemselves--in school hours--and the whole pack of them due elsewhere!\nShe had never witnessed so disgraceful a scene.\n\nHer dry precision shivered at Alwynne's coruscating adjectives. (It is\nnot to be denied that Alwynne, at that period of her career, was lax and\nlavish in speech, altogether too fond of conceits and superlatives.) She\ncut aridly into the lecture.\n\n\"Miss Durand! Are you aware of the time?\"\n\nAlwynne jumped, and the class jumped with her.\n\nIt was curious to watch that which but a moment before had been one\nabsorbed, collective personality suddenly disintegrating into Lotties\nand Maries and Sylvias, shy, curious, impish or indifferent, after their\nkind. Miss Vigers's presence intimidated: each peeping personality\nretired, snail-like, into its schoolgirl shell. With a curious yet\ndistinct consciousness of guilt, they edged away from the two women,\nhuddling sheepishly together, watching and waiting, inimical to the\ndisturber of their enjoyment, but distinctly doubtful as to whether\n\"Daffy,\" in the encounter that they knew quite well was imminent, would\nbe able to hold her own.\n\nBut Miss Durand was self-possessed. She looked down at Miss Vigers from\nher high seat and gave a natural little laugh.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Vigers! How you startled me!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I have been endeavouring to attract your attention for some\nmoments. Are you aware of the time?\"\n\nAlwynne glanced at the clock. The hands stood at an impossible hour.\n\n\"There!\" she remarked penitently, \"it's stopped again!\"\n\nShe smiled at the class, all ears and interest.\n\n\"One of you children will just have to remind me. Helen? No, you do the\nchalks already. Millicent!\" She singled out a dreamy child, who was\ntaking surreptitious advantage of the interruption to pore over the\npictures that had slid from the desk to the floor of the rostrum.\n\n\"Milly! Your head's a sieve too! Will you undertake to remind me? Each\ntime I have to be reminded--in goes a penny to the mission--and each\ntime you forget to remind me, you do the same. It'll do us both good!\nAnd if we both forget--the rest of the class must pull us up.\"\n\nThe little girl nodded, serious and important.\n\nAlwynne turned to Henrietta.\n\n\"Excuse me, Miss Vigers, were you wanting to speak to me? I'm afraid\nwe're in rather a muddle. Children--pick up those pictures: at\nleast--Helen and Milly! Go back to your desks, the rest of you.\" And\nthen, to Henrietta again, \"I suppose the gong will go in a minute?\"\n\nShe was being courteous, but she was implying quite clearly that she\nconsidered the interruption of her lesson unnecessary.\n\nHenrietta's eyes snapped.\n\n\"The twelve-fifteen gong went a long time ago, Miss Durand. It's nearly\none. Miss Hartill wishes to know what has happened to her class.\"\n\n\"My hat!\" murmured Alwynne, appalled.\n\nIt was the most rudimentary murmur--a mere movement of the lips; but\nHenrietta caught it. Justifiably, she detested slang. She stiffened yet\nmore, but Alwynne was continuing with deprecating gestures.\n\n\"This is dreadful! I'm awfully sorry, Miss Vigers, but, you know, we\nnever heard the gong! Not a sound! Are you sure it rang?\" (This to\nHenrietta, who never slackened her supervision of the relays of prefects\nresponsible for the ever-punctual gong. But Alwynne had no eye for\ndetail.) She continued agitatedly, unconscious of offence--\n\n\"But of course I must go and explain to Miss Hartill at once.\nChildren--get your things together, and go straight to the Lower Second.\nI'll come with you. Miss Vigers, I am so sorry--it was entirely my\nfault, of course, but we none of us heard the gong.\"\n\nBut as she spoke, and the girls, attentive and curious, obediently\ngathered up their belongings and filed into the passage, the gong,\naudible enough to any one less absorbed than Alwynne and her class had\nbeen, boomed for its last time that morning, the prolonged boom that was\nthe signal for the day-girls to go home. The children dispersed\nhurriedly, and Alwynne was left alone with Henrietta.\n\nAlwynne was grave--distinctly distressed.\n\n\"I must go and explain to Miss Hartill at once,\" she repeated, making\nfor the door.\n\n\"You needn't trouble yourself,\" Henrietta called after her. \"Miss\nHartill went home half-an-hour-ago.\"\n\nThe irrepressible note of gratification in her voice startled Alwynne.\nShe turned and faced her.\n\n\"I don't understand! You said she was waiting.\"\n\n\"When I left her, she had been waiting over half-an-hour. She told me\nthat she should do so no longer. Miss Hartill is not accustomed to be\nkept waiting while the junior mistresses amuse themselves.\"\n\nAlwynne raised her eyebrows and regarded her carefully.\n\n\"Did Miss Hartill ask you to tell me that? Are you her messenger?\" she\nasked blandly.\n\nThe last sentence had enlightened her, at any rate, as to Miss Vigers's\npersonal attitude to herself. She was perfectly aware that she had been\nguilty of gross carelessness; that, if Miss Hartill chose, she could\nmake it a serious matter for her; but for the moment her apprehensive\nregrets, as well as her profound sense of the apology due to the\nformidable Miss Hartill, were shrivelled in the white heat of her anger\nat the tone Henrietta Vigers was permitting herself. She was as much\nhurt as horrified by the revelation of an antipathy she had been\nunconscious of exciting; it was her first experience of gratuitous\nill-will. She rebelled hotly, incapable of analysing her emotion,\nindifferent to the probable consequences of a defiance of the older\nwoman, but passionately resolved that she would not allow any one alive\nto be rude to her.\n\nAnd Henrietta, amazed at the veiled rebuke of her manner, also lost her\ntemper.\n\n\"Miss Hartill and I were overwhelmed by such an occurrence. Do you\nrealise what you are doing, Miss Durand? You keep the children away from\ntheir lesson--you alter the school time-table to suit your\nconvenience--without a remark, or warning, or apology.\"\n\n\"I've told you already that I didn't hear the gong,\" interrupted\nAlwynne, between courtesy and impatience. She was trying hard to control\nherself.\n\n\"That is nonsense. Everybody hears the gong. You didn't choose to hear\nit, I suppose. Anyhow, I feel it my duty to tell you that such behaviour\nwill not be tolerated, Miss Durand, in this, or any school. It is not\nyour place to make innovations. I was horrified just now when I came in.\nThe class-room littered about with pictures and papers--the children not\nin their places--allowed to interrupt and argue. I never heard of such a\nthing.\"\n\nAlwynne's chin went up.\n\n\"Excuse me, Miss Vigers, but I hardly see that it is your business to\ncriticise my way of teaching.\"\n\n\"I am speaking to you for your own good,\" said Henrietta.\n\n\"That is kind of you; but if you speak to me in such a tone, you cannot\nexpect me to listen.\"\n\nHenrietta hesitated.\n\n\"Miss Durand, you are new to the school----\"\n\n\"That gives you no right to be rude to me!\"\n\nHenrietta took a step towards her.\n\n\"Rude? And you? I consider you insolent. Ever since you came to the\nschool you have been impossible. You go your own way, teach in your own\nway----\"\n\n\"I do as I'm told,\" said Alwynne sharply.\n\n\"In your own way. You neither ask nor take advice----\"\n\n\"At any rate, Miss Marsham is satisfied with me--she told me so last\nweek.\" She felt it undignified to be justifying herself, but she feared\nthat silent contempt would be lost on Miss Vigers. Also, such an\nattitude was not easy to Alwynne; she had a tongue; when she was angry,\nthe brutal effectiveness of Billingsgate must always tempt her.\n\nHenrietta countered coldly--\n\n\"I am sorry that I shall be obliged to undeceive her; that is, unless\nyou apologise----\"\n\n\"To Miss Hartill? Certainly! I intend to. I hope I know when I'm in the\nwrong.\"\n\n\"To me----\"\n\n\"To you?\" cried Alwynne, with a little high-pitched laugh. \"If you tell\nme what for?\"\n\n\"In Miss Marsham's absence I take her place,\" began Henrietta.\n\n\"Miss Hartill, I was told, did that.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken. The younger mistresses come to me for orders.\"\n\n\"I shall be the exception, then. I am not a housemaid. Will you let me\nget to my desk, please, Miss Vigers? I want my books.\"\n\nShe brushed past Henrietta, cheeks flaming, chin in air, and opened her\ndesk.\n\nThe secretary, for all her anger, hesitated uncertainly. She was unused\nto opposition, and had been accustomed to allow herself a greater\nlicence of speech than she knew. Alwynne's instant resentment, for all\nits crude young insolence, was, she realised, to some extent justified.\nShe had, she knew, exceeded her powers, but she had not stopped to\nconsider whether Alwynne would know that she had done so, or, knowing,\nhave the courage to act upon that knowledge. She had been staggered by\nthe girl's swift counter-attack and was soon wishing that she had left\nher alone; but she had gone too far to retreat with dignity; also, she\nhad by no means regained control of her temper.\n\n\"I can only report you to Miss Marsham,\" she remarked lamely, to\nAlwynne's back.\n\nAlwynne turned.\n\n\"You needn't trouble. If Miss Hartill doesn't, I shall go to her\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You?\" said Henrietta uneasily.\n\n\"Why,\" cried Alwynne, flaming out at her, \"d'you think I'm afraid of\nyou? D'you think I am going to stand this sort of thing? I know I was\ncareless, and I'm sorry. I'm going straight down to Miss Hartill to tell\nher so. And if she slangs me--it's all right. And if Miss Marsham slangs\nme--it's all right. She's the head of the school. But I won't be slanged\nby you. You are rude and interfering and I shall tell Miss Marsham so.\"\n\nShaking with indignation she slammed down the lid of her desk: and with\nher head held high, and a dignity that a friendly word would have\ndissolved into tears, walked out of the class-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nAlwynne Durand was quite aware that she was an arrant coward. The\ncronies of her not remote schooldays would have exclaimed at the label,\nhave cited this or that memorable audacity in confutation, but Alwynne\nherself knew better. When her impulsiveness had jockeyed her into an\nuncomfortable situation, pure pride could always be trusted to sustain\nher, strengthen her shoulders and sharpen her wits; but she triumphed\nwith shaking knees. Alwynne, touchy with the touchiness of eighteen, was\nbound to fling down her glove before Henrietta Vigers, and be\nostentatiously ready to face cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and\nall kinds of music. But Alwynne, half-an-hour later, on her way to Miss\nHartill and her overdue apology, was bound also to be feeling more like\na naughty schoolgirl than a mistress of six weeks' standing has any\nbusiness to feel, to be uneasily wondering what she should say, how she\nshould say it, and why on earth she had been fool enough to get herself\ninto the mess.\n\nIf it had been any one but Miss Hartill, with whom she had not exchanged\nfive words, but whom she had heard discussed, nevertheless, from every\nconceivable and inconceivable point of view, with that accompanying\nprofusion of anecdote of which only schoolgirl memory, so traditional as\nwell as personal, is capable.\n\nMiss Marsham, she had been given to understand might be head mistress,\nbut Miss Hartill was Miss Hartill. Alwynne, accustomed as she was to the\ncults of a boarding-school, had ended by growing exceedingly curious.\nYet when Miss Hartill had returned, a week or two late, to her post,\nAlwynne could not, as she phrased it, for the life of her see what all\nthe fuss was about. Miss Hartill was ordinary enough. Alwynne had looked\nup one morning, from an obscure corner of the Common-room, at the sound\nof a clicking latch, had had an impression of a tall woman, harshly\noutlined by the white panelled door, against which she leaned lazily as\nshe quizzed the roomful of women. Alwynne told herself that she was not\nat all impressed.... This the Miss Hartill of a hundred legends? This\nthe Olympian to whom three-fourths of the school said its prayers? Who\nhad split the staff into an enthusiastic majority and a minority that\nconcealed its dislike? Queer! Alwynne, shrugging her shoulders over the\nintricacies of a school's enthusiasms, had leaned back in her chair to\nwatch, between amusement and contempt, the commotion that had broken\nout. There was a babble of welcome, a cross-fire of question and answer.\nAnd then, over the heads of the little group that had gathered about the\ndoor, a pair of keen, roving eyes had settled on herself, coolly\nappraising. Alwynne had been annoyed with herself for flushing under the\nstare. She had a swift impression of being summed up, all raw and\nyouthful and ambitious as she was, her attitude of unwilling curiosity\ndetected, expected even. There had been a flicker of a smile, amused,\nfaintly insolent....\n\nBut it had all been merest impression. Miss Hartill, who had been,\nindeed, surrounded, inaccessible, from the instant of her entrance until\nthe prayer bell rang, did not look her way a second time. But the\nimpression had remained, and Alwynne, obscure in her newness and her\ncorner, found herself reconsidering this Miss Hartill, more roused than\nshe would confess. If she were not the Hypatia-Helen of the class-rooms,\nshe was none the less a personality! Whether Alwynne would like her was\nanother matter.\n\nAlwynne, in the next few days, had not come into direct contact with\nMiss Hartill. She had noticed, however, a certain stirring of the school\natmosphere, a something of briskness and tension that affected her\npleasantly. The children, she supposed, were getting into their\nstride.... But she began to see that the classes chiefly affected were\nthe classes with which Miss Hartill had most to do, that the mistresses,\ntoo, were working with unusual energy, and that Miss Vigers was less in\nevidence than heretofore; that, in short, Miss Hartill's return was\nmaking a difference. Insensibly she slipped into the fashion of being\nslightly in awe of her--was daily and undeniably relieved that her work\nhad as yet escaped the swift eyes and lazy criticism. But she was also\naware that she would be distinctly gratified if Miss Hartill should at\nany time express satisfaction with her and her efforts. Miss Hartill was\ncertainly interesting. She had wondered if she should ever get to know\nher; had hoped so.\n\nAnd now Napoleon Buonaparte and a stopped clock had between them managed\nthe business for her effectually. She was going to know Miss Hartill--a\njustifiably, and, according to Miss Vigers, excessively indignant Miss\nHartill. She looked forward without enthusiasm to that acquaintance. She\ndid not know what she should say to Miss Hartill.... But Miss Hartill\nwould do the talking, she imagined.... She was extremely sorry for\nherself as she knocked at Miss Hartill's door.\n\nThe maid left her stranded in the hall, and she waited, uncomfortably\nconscious of voices in the next room.\n\n\"Brand? But I don't know any----Drand! Oh, Durand! What an\nextraordinary time to----All right Bagot. No. Lunch as usual.\"\n\nThe maid slipped across the hall again to her kitchen as Miss Hartill\ncame forward, polite, unsmiling. She did not offer her hand, but stood\nwaiting for Alwynne to deliver herself of her errand.\n\nBut Alwynne was embarrassed. The exordium she had so carefully prepared\nduring her walk was eluding her. It had been easy to arrange the\nconversation beforehand, but Miss Hartill in the flesh was\ndisconcerting. She jumbled her opening sentences, flushed, floundered,\nand was silent. Ensued a pause.\n\nClare surveyed her visitor quizzically, enjoying her discomfort. Alwynne\nwas at her prettiest at a disadvantage. She had an air of shedding eight\nof her eighteen years, of recognising in her opponent a long-lost nurse.\n\nClare repressed a chuckle.\n\n\"Try again, Miss Durand,\" she said solemnly.\n\n\"I came,\" said Alwynne blankly. \"You see, I came----\" She paused again.\n\n\"Yes, I think I see that,\" said Clare, as one enlightened.\n\nAlwynne eyed her dubiously. There might or might not have been a twinkle\nin her colleague's eye. She took heart of grace and began again.\n\n\"Miss Hartill, I'm awfully sorry! It was me--I, I mean, I kept the\ngirls. I didn't hear the gong. Really and truly I didn't. Honestly, it\nwas an accident. I thought I ought to come and apologise. Truly, I'm\nmost awfully sorry, quite apart from avoiding getting into a row.\nBecause I've got into that already.\"\n\nClare's lips twitched. Alwynne was built on generous lines. She had a\ngood carriage, could enter a room effectively. Clare had not been\nunaware of her secure manner. Her present collapse was the more amusing.\nClare was beginning to guess that what Miss Durand did, she did\nwholeheartedly.\n\n\"I expect you're simply wild with me. Miss Vigers said you would be,\"\nsaid Alwynne hopelessly.\n\n\"Miss Vigers ought to know,\" said Clare.\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n\"I'm frightfully sorry,\" said Alwynne suggestively.\n\n\"Are you, Miss Durand?\"\n\n\"I mean, apart from upsetting you, I'm so savage with myself. One\ndoesn't exactly enjoy making a fool of oneself, does one, Miss Hartill?\nYou know how it feels. And it's my first post, and I did mean to do it\nwell, and I've only been here six weeks, and I'm in a row with three\npeople already.\"\n\n\"How--three?\" said Clare with interest.\n\n\"Well--there's you----\"\n\n\"I think we're settling that,\" said Clare, with her sudden smile.\n\n\"Are we?\" Alwynne looked up so warily that Clare laughed outright.\n\n\"But the other two, Miss Durand--the other two? This grows interesting.\"\n\n\"Well, you see,\" Alwynne expanded, \"I had an awful row with Miss\nVigers--and she's sure to tell Miss Marsham. I suppose I was rude, but\nshe did make me so mad. I don't see that it was her business to come and\nslang me before my class.\"\n\n\"My class,\" corrected Clare.\n\n\"I wouldn't have minded you,\" said Alwynne, lifting ingenuous eyes.\n\n\"I'm flattered,\" murmured Clare.\n\n\"Well--you would have understood,\" said Alwynne with conviction. \"But\nMiss Vigers----I ask you, Miss Hartill, what would be the use of\ntalking about Napoleon to Miss Vigers?\"\n\n\"I give it up,\" said Clare promptly.\n\n\"There you are!\" Alwynne waved her hand triumphantly.\n\n\"But, excuse me\"--Clare was elaborately respectful--\"has Napoleon any\ntraceable connection with the kidnapping of my class?\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought I explained.\" Alwynne plunged into her story. \"You see, I\nwas giving them Elocution--they're learning the _Incident in the French\nCamp_--you know?\"\n\nClare nodded.\n\n\"Well, I thought they were rather more wooden than usual, and\nI found out that they knew practically nothing about Napoleon!\nMarengo--Talleyrand--never heard of 'em! Waterloo, and that he behaved\nbadly to his wife--that's all they knew!\"\n\n\"The English in a nutshell!\" murmured Clare.\n\n\"So, of course, I told them all about him, and his life, and tit-bits\nlike the S\u00c3\u00a8vres tea-things, and Madame Sans-g\u00c3\u00aane. They loved it. And I\nwas showing them pictures and I suppose we got absorbed. You can't help\nit with Napoleon, somehow. Oh, Miss Hartill, doesn't it seem crazy,\nthough, to keep those children at Latin exercises, and the exports of\nLower Tooting, and Bills of Attainder in the reign of Queen Anne, before\nthey know about things like Napoleon, and Homer, and the Panama Canal?\nWouldn't you rather know about the life of Buddha than the war of\nJenkins's ear? Not that I ever got to the Georges myself! Oh, it makes\nme so wild! It's like stuffing them with pea-nuts, when one has got a\nbasket of peaches on one's arm. It isn't education! It's goose-cramming!\nI can't explain properly what I mean. I expect you think I'm a fool!\"\n\n\"An enthusiast. It's much the same,\" said Clare absently. \"You'll get\nover it.\" Then, with a twinkle: \"Reform's an excellent thing, of\ncourse--but why annex my class to experiment with?\"\n\nAlwynne defervesced.\n\nThere was an unhappy pause.\n\n\"You know, I'm most awfully sorry,\" said Alwynne at last, as one making\na brilliant and original contribution to the discussion.\n\nA piercing shriek from the kitchen interrupted them. Alwynne jumped, but\nClare was undisturbed.\n\n\"It's only Bagot. She's always having accidents. But she's an excellent\ncook. After all, what's a shilling's worth of crockery a week compared\nwith a good cook? But to return to Napoleon and the Lower Third----\"\n\n\"You don't think she's hurt herself?\" Alwynne ventured to interrupt.\n\"She did squeal.\"\n\nClare looked suddenly concerned.\n\n\"I hope not. I haven't had lunch yet.\"\n\nShe went to the kitchen door, reappearing with a slightly harried air.\n\n\"Miss Durand, I wish you'd come here a minute. She's cut her hand. Oh,\nlavishly! Most careless! What is one to do? I suppose one must bandage\nit?\"\n\nHer tone of helpless disgust was so genuine that Alwynne was inclined to\nlaugh. So there were circumstances that could be too much even for Miss\nHartill! How reassuring! And how it warmed the cockles of one's heart to\nher! Her lips twitched mischievously as she looked from the disconcerted\nmistress to the sniffing maid, but she lost no time in stripping off her\ngloves and setting to work, issuing orders the while that Clare obeyed\nwith a meekness that surprised herself.\n\n\"Linen, please, Miss Hartill, or old rags! It's rather a bad cut.\" Then,\nto the maid, \"How on earth did you do it? A tin-opener? No, no, Miss\nHartill! a duster's no good. An old handkerchief or something.\" She was\nachieving complicated effects with a fork and a knotted scarf as she\nspoke, and Clare, obediently tearing linen into strips, considered her\ncritically. The girl was capable then, as well as amusing.... That\ntourniquet might not be professional, but it was at least effective....\nThe bleeding was stopping.... Very good of her to toil over Bagot's\nunappetising hand.... Clare marvelled at her unconcern, for she was\ndainty enough in her own person to please even Clare's fastidious eye.\nClare supposed that it was a good thing that some people had the nursing\ninstinct.... She thanked her stars that she herself had not....\n\nAlwynne, unconscious of scrutiny, put in her final safety-pin, settled\nthe sling and stepped back at last, surveying her handiwork with some\npride.\n\n\"It'll want a stitch, though. She'd better go to the doctor, I think,\"\nshe said decisively. \"Shall I come with you?\" This to the maid,\ncomplacently the centre of attention.\n\nBut the maid preferred to fetch her mother. \"Her mother lived quite\nclose, miss. If Miss 'Artill could get on----\"\n\n\"She can't do any cooking with that hand,\" said Alwynne to Clare, more\nin decision than appeal, and Clare acquiescing, she fetched hat and\ncoat, manipulated hatpins, and bundled the girl forth.\n\nShe returned to the kitchen to find Miss Hartill, skirts clutched high,\neyeing the crowded table with distaste, and prodding with a\ntoasting-fork at the half-prepared meal.\n\n\"Isn't it disgusting? How these people bleed! I can't stand a mess!\nReally, I'm very much obliged to you, Miss Durand for seeing to Bagot.\nI'm no good at that sort of thing. I hate touching people. You don't\nthink it was a bad cut, though?\"\n\n\"It must have hurt! She won't be able to use her hand for a day or two.\"\n\nClare rubbed her nose peevishly. She had a comical air of resenting the\nnecessity for concerning herself with her own domestic arrangements.\n\n\"Well, what am I to do? And I loathe charwomen. She might at least have\ngot lunch first!\"\n\n\"The meat's cooked, anyhow,\" said Alwynne hopefully, drawing forth a\ncongealing dishful.\n\nClare shivered.\n\n\"Take it away! It's all over Bagot.\"\n\n\"I don't think it is.\" Alwynne examined it cautiously.\n\nClare gave her a short laugh.\n\n\"Anyhow, it doesn't appeal any more. Never mind, Miss Durand, I shall\nmanage--I mustn't keep you.\"\n\nAlwynne disregarded the hint. She seemed preoccupied.\n\n\"There aren't any eggs, I suppose,\" she ventured diffidently.\n\nClare flung out vague hands.\n\n\"Heaven knows! It's Bagot's business. Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Alwynne had crossed the room and was struggling with a stiff\ncupboard door, \"Elsbeth says I'm a fool at cooking (Elsbeth's my aunt,\nyou know), but I can make omelets----\" The door gave suddenly and\nAlwynne fell forward into the dark pantry. There was a clatter as of\nscattered bread-pans. She soon emerged, however, floury but serene.\n\n\"Yes! There are some! It wouldn't take ten minutes, Miss Hartill. That\nis--if----\" she sought delicately for a tactful phrase: \"if you would\nperhaps like to go away and read. If any one stands about and\nwatches--you know what I mean----\"\n\n\"Are you proposing to cook my lunch?\" Clare demanded.\n\n\"Of course, if you don't like omelets,\" said Alwynne demurely.\n\nClare laughed outright.\n\n\"I do--I do. All right, Miss Durand, I'm too hungry to refuse. But I see\nthrough it, you know. It's to cry quits!\"\n\nAlwynne broke in indignantly--\n\n\"It isn't! It's the _amende honorable_--at least, if it doesn't scorch.\"\n\n\"All right, I accept it!\" Clare pacified her; then, as she left the\nkitchen, \"Miss Durand?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Hartill?\"\n\n\"Are you going to make one for Miss Vigers?\"\n\nAlwynne's face fell.\n\n\"I'd forgotten Miss Vigers.\"\n\nClare twinkled.\n\n\"Perhaps--if it doesn't scorch--I'll see what I can do,\" she promised\nher.\n\nThe lunch was a success. Alwynne, dishing up, had her hat ordered off\nher head, and was soon sharing the omelet and marvelling at herself for\nbeing where she was, and Clare, for her part, found herself enjoying her\nvisitor as much as her meal.\n\nClare Hartill led a sufficiently solitary life. She was a woman of\nfeverish friendships and sudden ruptures. Always the cleverest and most\nrestless of her circle, she usually found her affinities as unable to\nsatisfy her demands on their intellect as on their emotions.\nDisillusionment would be swift and final: Clare never forgave a bore.\nGradually it came to pass that intercourse she so carefully fostered\nwith her elder pupils became her absorbing and satisfying interest. She\nplumed herself on her independence of social amenities, did not guess,\nwould not have admitted, that her pleasure in a chance table companion\nhad its flavour of pathos. It was enough to acknowledge to herself that\nAlwynne Durand, with her enthusiasms, her incoherencies, and her\ncapacities had certainly caught her difficult fancy. She liked the\ngirl's manner; its compound of shyness and audacity, deference and\nindependence pleased her sophisticated taste. She found her racy and\noriginal, and, in the exertion of drawing her out, was herself at her\nbest. A brilliant talker, she chose to listen, and soon heard all there\nwas to hear of Alwynne's short history; of her mother's sister, Elsbeth\nLoveday (Clare pricked up her ears at the name), who had reared her from\nbabyhood; of her schooldays; her crude young likes and dislikes; her\nhero-worships and passionate, vague ambitions. Clare knew it all by\nheart, had heard the tale from more pairs of lips than she could\nremember, for more years than she cared to count. But Alwynne,\nnevertheless, told it in a way of her own that appealed to Clare and\ninterested her anew. She told herself that the girl was worth\ncultivating; and what with apt comments, apter silences, and the\nhalf-finished phrases and abrupt noddings of perfect comprehension,\ncontrived to make Alwynne think her the most sympathetic person she had\never had the fortune to meet. Indeed, they pleased each other so well\nthat when Alwynne, towards tea-time, made an unwilling move, Clare was\nas unwilling, for her part, to let her go.\n\n\"It was certainly a most excellent omelet,\" she said, as she sped her\nfrom the door. \"I suppose you won't come and cook me another to-night?\"\n\nAlwynne took her at her word.\n\n\"I will! Of course I will! Would you like me to, really? I will! I'd\nlove to!\"\n\nClare laughed.\n\n\"Oh, I was only in fun. Whatever would your aunt say?\"\n\n\"She wouldn't mind,\" began Alwynne eagerly.\n\nClare temporised.\n\n\"But your work? Haven't you any work?\"\n\nAlwynne overwhelmed her.\n\n\"That's all right! It isn't much! I'll sit up. I wish you'd let me. I\nwould love to. You must have some one to cook your supper for you,\nmustn't you?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, if you'd really like to----\" Clare hesitated between\njest and earnest.\n\nBut Alwynne was wholly in earnest.\n\n\"I'll come. Thank you very much indeed,\" said Alwynne, eyes sparkling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nIn the months that followed the eating of the omelet, Alwynne would have\nagreed that the cynic who said that \"an entirely successful love-affair\ncan only be achieved by foundlings\" should have included friendship in\nhis dictum. For relations ... well, everybody knew what everybody meant\nwhen relations were mentioned in that particular tone; and Elsbeth,\ndearest of maiden aunts, was nevertheless at times aggressively a\nrelation: privileged to wet-blanket enthusiasms.\n\nElsbeth made, indeed, no stand against the alliance that had sprung\nmushroom-like into existence; was courteous, in her sweet silent\nfashion, to Clare Hartill at their occasional meetings; but she remained\nsubtly uninterested. But when, again, had that suppressed and\nself-effacing personality shown interest in any living thing save\nAlwynne herself?\n\nAlwynne, shrugging her shoulders, and ignoring, as youth must, the\naffectionate prevision that had lapped her all her life, supposed that\nshe must not expect too much of poor, dear Elsbeth.... (It was\ncharacteristic of their relationship that she never called her guardian\n\"Aunt.\") Elsbeth, darling Elsbeth--but a little limited, perhaps? Hardly\nto be expected that she should appreciate a Miss Hartill....\n\nElsbeth, though Alwynne never guessed it, quite understood what went on\nin her niece's mind: was resigned to it. She knew that she was not a\nclever woman. She had been too much occupied, all her life, in smoothing\nthe way for other people, to have had leisure for her own cultivation,\nphysical or mental. Her two years of teaching, in the uncertificated\n'eighties, had but served to reveal to herself her ingrained incapacity\nfor government. She had never forgotten the humiliation of those months\nwhen Clare Hartill, a pitiless fourteen-year-old girl, had headed one\nsuccessful revolt after another against her. It had been an episode;\nwith the advent of Alwynne she had returned to domesticity; but the\nexperience had intensified her innate lack of self-esteem. There were\ntimes when she seriously debated whether, in bringing up her orphaned\nniece, she were indulging herself at the expense of her duty. She knew\nquite well, and rejoiced shamefacedly in the knowledge, that Alwynne,\nher beautiful, brilliant, headstrong girl, could twist the old aunt\nround her little finger. And that, of course, could not be good for\nAlwynne.\n\nAlwynne was, to do her justice, extremely fond of her aunt. Till the\nadvent of Clare Hartill, Elsbeth had been the pole-star of her world.\nAll the more disconcerting of Elsbeth, receiver of confidences,\ntherefore, to be so entirely uninterested in the comet that was\ndeflecting Alwynne from her accustomed orbit.\n\nShe wondered occasionally what her aunt's history had been. Elsbeth was\nreticent: never a woman of reminiscences. Her relations were distant\nones, whom she rarely mentioned and apparently more rarely missed.\nAlwynne was the more surprised one breakfast, when, retailing the\nschool's latest scandal, she was interrupted by an exclamation of\npleasure.\n\n\"Alwynne! The Lumsdens are coming back!\" Elsbeth rustled foreign paper\ndelightedly.\n\nAlwynne wrinkled her brows.\n\n\"The Lumsdens? Oh--those cousins of yours?\"\n\n\"Yes. The youngest, Rosemary, only died last year. Don't you remember?\nThey've lived abroad for years on account of her health, and her son\nRoger always went out to her for his holidays.\"\n\n\"Roger? Is that the velveteen boy in the big album?\"\n\nElsbeth laughed.\n\n\"He must be thirty by now. The estate went to him. It was let, you know,\nand the Great House at Dene--to a school, I believe. They had lost\nmoney. And Rosemary was always extravagant. Roger went to America for a\ntime. But still he's well enough off. He came home when his mother died\nlast year, and now, it seems, he's taken a house close to their old\nhome, and settled down as a market-gardener. The Lumsdens are to come\nand keep house for him. He's very fond of his aunts, I know. Well! To\nthink of seeing Jean and Alicia again after all these years. They want\nus to come and stay when they've settled down.\"\n\n\"You'll enjoy that?\" Alwynne eyed her aunt curiously. Elsbeth's pale\ncheeks were pink, her faded eyes dreamy. Her unconscious hand was\nrapping out its tune upon the tablecloth--the only symptom of excitement\nthat Elsbeth ever showed. \"Were you fond of them? Why haven't you ever\nbeen to see them, Elsbeth?\"\n\n\"Time flies. And I certainly can't afford to gad about the Riviera. And\nthere was you, you know. Besides----\" she hesitated.\n\n\"Besides what?\"\n\nElsbeth did not seem to hear.\n\n\"You'll like Dene, Alwynne. Oh, yes, I know it well. I used to stay with\nthem--before the Great House was let. Years ago. And Roger--I hope\nyou'll get on with Roger. I haven't seen him since he was five. A jolly\nlittle fellow. And from what Alicia says----\"\n\nBut Alwynne would not take any interest in Roger. He had a snub nose in\nthe photograph; and besides, she hated men. So dull. As Clare\nsaid----Indeed, she wasn't always quoting Clare! She didn't always set\nup Clare's judgment against Elsbeth's! Elsbeth needn't get huffy! She\nwould like to go down to Dene very much, if Elsbeth wanted to, some time\nor other.\n\nBut when the holidays came and the formal invitation, Alwynne was less\namenable.\n\nWhy couldn't Elsbeth go alone? Elsbeth couldn't expect her to go and\nstay with utter strangers. She hated strangers. Besides, there was\nClare. (It was \"Clare\" and \"Alwynne\" by that time.) She and Clare had\nplanned out every day of the holidays. Everything fixed. She really\ncouldn't ask Clare to upset all her arrangements. It wouldn't be fair.\nAwfully sorry, of course, but why couldn't Alwynne's dear Elsbeth go by\nherself? She, Alwynne, could keep house. Oh, perfectly well! She wasn't\na fool! She wouldn't dream of spoiling Elsbeth's holiday, but Elsbeth\nmust see that there was no need for Alwynne to share it.\n\nBut Elsbeth was unusually obstinate. Elsbeth, it appeared, wanted\nAlwynne with her; wanted to show Alwynne to these old friends; wanted to\nshow these old friends to Alwynne; wouldn't enjoy the visit without\nAlwynne at her elbow; refused utterly to be convinced of\nunreasonableness. Alwynne would enjoy the change, the country--didn't\nAlwynne love the country?--and if she herself, and Alicia, and Jean,\nwere not of Alwynne's generation, there was always Roger! By all\naccounts Roger was very nice; witness the aunts who adored him.\n\nAlwynne snorted.\n\nShe argued the matter mercilessly, length, breadth, depth and back\nagain, and ended, as Elsbeth knew she would, by getting her own way. But\nElsbeth did not go to Dene by herself. There she was mulish. Go visiting\nand leave the housekeeping to Alwynne's tender mercies? Heaven forbid!\nThere was more in housekeeping than dusting a bedroom, making peppermint\ncreams, or wasting four eggs on an omelet.\n\nSo Alwynne spent her pleasant holidays in and out of Clare Hartill's\npocket and Elsbeth stayed at home. But Elsbeth had learned her lesson.\nIt was many a long day before she again suggested a visit to Dene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nOne of Alwynne's duties was the conduct of a small \"extra\" class,\nconsisting of girls, who, for reasons of stupidity, ill-health or\ndefective grounding, fell too far below the average of knowledge in\ntheir respective classes. She devoted certain afternoons in the week to\ncoaching them, and was considered to be unusually successful in her\nmethods. She could be extremely patient, and had quaint and unorthodox\nways of insinuating facts into her pupils' minds. As she told Elsbeth,\nshe invented their memories for them. She was sufficiently imaginative\nto realise their difficulties, yet sufficiently young to dream of\ndeveloping, in due course, all her lame ducks into swans. She was\nintensely interested in hearing how her coaching had succeeded; her\npleasure at an amended place in class was so genuine, her disappointment\nat a collapse so comically real, yet so devoid of contempt, so tinged\nwith conviction that it was anybody's fault but the culprit's, that\neither attitude was an incentive to real effort. Like Clare, she did not\nsuffer fools gladly, but unlike Clare, she had not the moral courage to\nbe ruthless. Stupidity seemed as terrible to her as physical deformity;\nshe treated it with the same touch of motherliness, the same instinctive\ndesire to spare it realisation of its own unsightliness.\n\nHer rather lovable cowardice brought a mixed reward; she stifled in\nsick-rooms, yet invalids liked her well; she was frankly envious of\nClare's circle of brilliant girls and as inevitably surrounded by\ninarticulate adorers, who bored her mightily, but whose clumsy affection\nshe was too kindhearted to suppress.\n\nIt had been well for Alwynne, however, that her following was of the\nduller portion of the school. This Clare could endure, could\ncountenance; such boy-bishopry could not affect her own sovereignty, and\nher subject's consequence increased her own. But to see Alwynne swaying,\nhowever unconsciously, minds of a finer type, would not have been easy\nfor Clare. She had grown very fond of Alwynne; but the sentiment was\nproprietary; she could derive no pleasure from her that was not\npersonal, and, in its most literal sense, selfish. She was unmaternal to\nthe core. She could not see human property admired by others with any\nsensation but that of a double jealousy; she was subtly angered that\nAlwynne could attract, yet was caught herself in the net of those\nattractions, and unable to endure to watch them spread for any but\nherself.\n\nAlwynne, quite unconscious of the trait, had at first done herself harm\nby her unfeigned interest in Clare's circle. It took the elder woman\nsome suspicious weeks to realise that Alwynne lacked completely her own\n_dompteuse_ instinct, her craving for power; that she was as innocent of\nknowledge of her own charm as unwedded Eve; that her impulse to Clare\nwas an impulse of the freshest, sweetest hero-worship; but the\nrealisation came at last, and Clare opened her hungry heart to her, and,\nwarmed by Alwynne's affection, wondered that she had hesitated so long.\n\nAlwynne never guessed that she had been doubted. Clare was proud of her\ngenuine skill as a character reader--had been a little pleased to give\nAlwynne proof of her penetration when occasion arose; and Alwynne, less\ntrained, less critical, thought her omniscient, and never dreamed that\nthe motives of her obscurest actions, the sources of her most veiled\nreferences were not plain to Clare. Secure of comprehension, she went\nher way: any one in whom Clare was interested must needs attract her: so\nshe took pains to become intimate with Clare's adorers, from a very real\nsympathy with their appreciation of Clare, whom she no more grudged to\nthem than a priestess would grudge the unveiling of her goddess to the\ninitiate. She received their confidences, learned their secrets, fanned\nthe flame of their enthusiasms. Too lately a schoolgirl herself, too\ninnocent and ignorant to dream of danger, she did her loyal utmost in\nfurtherance of the cult, measuring the artificial and unbalanced\nemotions she encountered by the rule of her own saner affection, and, in\nher desire to see her friend appreciated, in all good faith utilised her\ndegree of authority to encourage what an older woman would have\nrecognised and combated as incipient hysteria.\n\nGradually she became, through her frank sympathy, combined with her\nslightly indeterminate official position, the intermediary, the\ninterpreter of Clare to the feverish school. Clare herself, her initial\ndistrust over, found this useful. She could afford to be moody, erratic,\nwhimsical; to be extravagant in her praises and reproofs; to\ndeteriorate, at times, into a caricature of her own bizarre personality,\nwith the comfortable assurance that there was ever a magician in her\nwake to steady her tottering shrines, mix oil with her vitriol, and\nprove her pinchbeck gold.\n\nFatal, this relaxation of effort, to a woman of Clare's type. Love of\nsome sort was vital to her. Of this her surface personality was dimly,\nashamedly aware, and would, if challenged, have frigidly denied; but the\nwhole of her larger self knew its need, and saw to it that that need was\nsatisfied. Clare, unconscious, had taught Clare, conscious, that there\nmust be effort--constant, straining effort at cultivation of all her\nalluring qualities, at concealment of all in her that could\nrepulse--effort that all appearances of complete success must never\nallow her to relax. She knew well the evanescent character of a\nschoolgirl's affection; so well that when her pupils left the school she\nseldom tried to retain her hold upon them. Their letters would come\nthick as autumn leaves at first; she rarely answered, or after long\nintervals; and the letters dwindled and ceased. She knew that, in the\nnature of things, it must be so, and had no wish to prolong the\nfarewells.\n\nAlso, her interest in her correspondents usually died first; to sustain\nit required their physical nearness. But every new year filled the gaps\nleft by the old, stimulated Clare to fresh exertion.\n\nSo the lean years went by. Then came vehement Alwynne--no\nschoolgirl--yet more youthful and ingenuous than any mistress had right\nto be, loving with all the discrimination of a fine mind, and all the\nardour of an affectionate child. Here was no question of a fleeting\ndevotion that must end as the schooldays ended. Here was love for Clare\nat last, a widow's cruse to last her for all time. Clare thanked the\ngods of her unbelief, and, relaxing all effort, settled herself to enjoy\nto the full the cushioning sense of security; the mock despot of their\npleasant, earlier intercourse becoming, as she bound Alwynne ever more\nclosely to her, albeit unconsciously, a very real tyrant indeed.\n\nYet she had no intention of weakening her hold on any lesser member of\nher chosen coterie. Alwynne was too ingenuous, too obviously subject\nthrough her own free impulse, to entirely satisfy: Clare's love of power\nhad its morbid moments, when a struggling victim, head averted, pleased\nher. There was never, among the new-comers, a child, self-absorbed,\nnonchalant or rebellious, who passed a term unmolested by Miss Hartill.\nEgoism aroused her curiosity, her suspicion of hidden lands, virgin,\nripe for exploration; indifference piqued her; a flung gauntlet she\nwelcomed with frank amusement. She had been a rebel in her own time, and\nhad ever a thrill of sympathy for the mutinies she relentlessly crushed.\nWar, personal war, delighted her; she was a mistress of tactics, and the\ncertainty of eventual victory gave zest to her campaigns. She did not\nrealise that the strain upon her childish opponents was very great. The\nfiner, the more sensitive the character, the more complete the eventual\ndefeat, the more permanent its effects. Clare was pitiless after\nvictory: not till then did she examine into the nature thus enslaved,\nseldom did she find it worth the trouble of the skirmish. In most cases\nshe gave semi-liberty; enough of smiles to keep the children feverishly\nat work to please her (the average of achievement in her classes was\nastounding), and enough of indifference to prevent them from becoming a\nnuisance. To the few that pleased her fastidious taste, she gave of her\nbest, lavishly, as she had given to Alwynne. There are women to-day, old\ngirls of the school, who owe Clare Hartill the best things of their\nlives, their wide knowledge, their original ideas, their hopeful futures\nand happy memories: to whom she was an inspiration incarnate. The Clare\nthey remember is not the Clare that Elsbeth knew, that Alwynne learned\nto know, that Clare herself, one bitter night, faced and blanched at.\nBut which of them had knowledge of the true Clare, who shall say?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn Clare's favourite class was a certain Louise Denny. She was\nthirteen--nearly three years below the average of the class in age. How\nfar beyond it in all else, not even Clare realised.\n\nClare had discovered her, as she phrased it, in the limbo of the Lower\nThird. She had been paying one of her surprise visits to the afternoon\nextra needlework classes--(the possibility of her occasional appearance,\nbook in hand, was responsible for the school's un-English proficiency in\nhemming, darning and kindred mysteries), to read aloud to the children\ncarefully edited excerpts from Poe's _Tales_, had forgotten her copy and\nhad been shyly offered another, private property from Louise Denny's\ndesk. Thereon must Alwynne, for a week or two, resign perforce her Lower\nThird literature classes to Clare, intent on her blue rose. Louise's\ncompositions had been read--Clare and Alwynne spent a long evening over\nthem, weighing, comparing, discussing. Clare could be exquisitely\ntender, could keep all-patient vigil over an unfolding mind, provided\nthat the calyx concealed a rare enough blossom. Louise was encouraged,\nher shyness swept aside, her ideas developed, her knowledge tested; she\nwas fed, too, cautiously, on richer and richer food--stray evening\nlectures, picture galleries with Alwynne, headiest of cicerones; the\nfreedom of the library and long talks with Clare. Finally Clare, bearing\ndown all opposition, transplanted her to the Lower Fifth, containing at\nthat time some brilliantly clever girls. Louise justified her by\nspeedily capturing, and doggedly retaining, the highest place in the\nclass.\n\nClare was delighted. Her critics--there were some mistresses who vaguely\ndisapproved of the experiment--were refuted, and the class, already\nneeding no spur, outdoing itself in its efforts to compete with the\nintruder, swept the board at an important public examination.\n\nOn the morning of the announcement of results, Clare entered her\nform-room radiant. It was a low, many-windowed room, with desks ranged\nsingle-file along the walls. The class being a small one, the girls were\naccustomed to sit for their lessons at a large oval table at the upper\nend of the room. Beside the passage doorway, there was a smaller one,\nthat led into the studio, and was never used by the children. Clare,\nhowever, would sometimes enter by it, but so seldom that they invariably\nforgot to keep watch. Clare enjoyed the occasional view she thus\nobtained of her unconscious and relaxed subjects, and the piquancy of\ntheir uncensored conversation; she enjoyed still more the sudden hush,\nthe crisp thrill, that ran through their groups, when they became aware\nof her, observant in the doorway.\n\nOn the morning in question she had watched them for some little while.\nBefore each girl lay her open exercise-book and school edition of\nBrowning. They were deep in discussion of their work, very eager upon\nsome question. By the empty chair at the head of the table sat Marion\nHughes, blonde and placid, a rounded elbow on her neatly written theme,\nthat her neighbour was trying to pull away, to compare with her own\nwell-inked manuscript. This neighbour, one Agatha Middleton, was dark,\ngaunt, with restless eyes and restless tongue. She was old for her\nfifteen years, and had been original until she discovered that her\noriginality appealed to Miss Hartill. Since then she had imitated her\nown mannerisms, and was rapidly degenerating into an eccentric. The law\nof opposites had decreed that the sedate Marion should be her bosom\nfriend. They went up the school together, an incongruous, yet\nwell-suited pair, for they were so unlike that there could be no\nrivalry. Marion was alternately amused and dazzled by the pyrotechnic\nAgatha. Agatha's respect for Marion's common sense was pleasantly\ntempered by a conviction of superior mental agility. Finally, they were\nunited by their common devotion to their form-mistress. Whether it would\nhave occurred to Marion, unprompted, to admire Miss Hartill, is\nuncertain. Her affections were domestic and calm. But adoration was in\nthe air, and she had not sufficient originality to be unfashionable. She\nwas caught, too, in Agatha's whirlwind emotions, and ended by\nworshipping Clare conscientiously and sincerely. Clare, on her side,\nrespected her, as she told Alwynne, for her \"painstaking and intelligent\nstupidity,\" and, recognising a nature too worthy for neglect, yet too\nlymphatic to be suitable for experiments, was uniformly kind to her.\nAgatha, she had revelled in for six weeks, and had since more or less\nignored as a bore. Below the pair sat a spectacled student, predestined\nto scholarships and a junior mistress-ship; opposite, between giggling\ntwins, a vivid little Jewess, whose showy work was due to the same\nvanity that tied her curls with giant bows, and over-corsetted her\nmatured figure. At the foot of the oval, directly opposite Clare's\nvacant chair, stood Louise, flushed and excited, chanting low-voicedly a\nsnatch of verse.\n\nDuring a lull in the hubbub Marion called to her down the table--\n\n\"How many pages?\"\n\nLouise flushed. She was still a little in awe of these elders whom she\nhad outstripped. She rapidly counted the leaves of her essay, and held\nup both hands, smiling shyly.\n\nMarion exclaimed.\n\n\"Ten? You marvel! I only got to seven. I simply didn't understand it.\nWhatever did you find to say?\"\n\nAgatha fell upon the query.\n\n\"That's nothing! I've done twenty-two!\" she cried triumphantly, and\nturned to face the shower of comments.\n\n\"Miss Hartill will bless you. She said last time that you thought ink\nand ideas were synonyms.\"\n\n\"Agatha only writes three words to a line anyway.\"\n\nThey liked her, but she was of the type whose imperiousness provokes\nsnubs.\n\n\"Well, I thought I shouldn't get it done under forty--an essay on _The\nDark Tower_. It's the beastliest yet. _The Ancient Mariner_ was nothing\nto it. I've made an awful hash--didn't you?\"\n\n\"I understood all right when she read it, and explained. It's so absurd\nnot to let one take notes. I've been years at it. Fortunately she said\nwe needn't learn it--Louise and I--with all our extra work.\" An\nunimaginative hockey captain fluttered her pages distractedly.\n\n\"Oh, but I have!\" Louise looked up quickly.\n\n\"Why?\" The hockey captain opened her eyes and mouth.\n\n\"Oh, I rather wanted to.\"\n\nThe little Jewess giggled.\n\n\"'_D\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0?_'\" she murmured. She did not love Clare.\n\nMarion returned to the subject with her usual perseverance.\n\n\"Did you understand it, kid?\"\n\nLouise stammered a little.\n\n\"When she reads it, and when I say it aloud, I think I do. It was\nimpossible to write it down.\"\n\n\"Let's see what you have put.\" Agatha, by a quick movement, possessed\nherself of Louise's exercise-book. Louise, shy and desperate, strove\nsilently with her neighbours, who, curious, held her back, while Agatha,\nholding the book at arm's length, recited from it in a high mocking\nvoice.\n\n\"_Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came._ Description! Description!\nDescription! for three--five--seven pages! You've let yourself go,\nLouise! Ah, here we are--_The meaning of the poem_. Now we're getting to\nit. _Shakespeare and Browning may have known all the real history of\nChilde Roland; the reason of his quest, the secret of the horror of the\nTower; but we are left in ignorance. That does not matter, for, as we\nread, the inner meaning of the terrible poem kills all curiosity.\nShuddering we close the book, and pray to God that Childe Roland's\njourney may never be ours; that for our adventurous souls,\nknight-erranting through this queer life, there may never come a choice\nof ways, a turning from the pleasant high-road, to go upon a hideous\njourney; till, crossing the Plains of Loneliness, Fear and Sorrow, we\nface the Hills of Madness, and enter the Dark Tower of that Despair\nwhich is our soul's death._ With capital letters galore! What a\nsentence! Here, shut up, you spit-fire!\" Louise had wrenched herself\nfree and flung herself upon Agatha, in a white heat of anger.\n\n\"Give it me! You've no right! You've no right!\" she gasped. Her shyness\nhad gone, she was blazing with indignation.\n\nAgatha, the book held teasingly out of reach, affected to search for her\nplace. Louise raised her clenched fist desperately.\n\nA cool hand caught her wrist in a firm yet kindly grip. A hush fell on\nthe voluble group and Agatha collapsed into an apologetic nonentity.\n\nClare, who had entered in her usual noiseless fashion, stood a moment\nbetween the combatants, watching the effect of her appearance. Her hand\nshifted to Louise's bony little shoulder; through the thin blouse she\ncould feel the driven blood pulsing. She did not move till she felt the\nchild regaining comparative calm, when, giving her a gentle push towards\nher place, she walked slowly to the head of the table and seated\nherself. The class watched her furtively. It was quite aware that all\nrules of decorum had been transgressed--that pains and penalties would\nbe in order with any other mistress. But with Miss Hartill there was\nalways glorious uncertainty--and Miss Hartill did not look annoyed.\nLittle gestures began to break the tension and Agatha, relieved, smiled\na shade too broadly. Instantly Clare closed with her.\n\nShe began blandly--\n\n\"Agatha, I thought you could read aloud better than that. You are not\ndoing your work justice. Pass me your essay.\"\n\n\"It's Louise's,\" said Agatha helplessly.\n\n\"Ah, I see. And you kindly read it to us for her? It's a pity you didn't\nunderstand what you read--but an excuse, of course. Louise must not\nexpect too much.\"\n\nAgatha flung up her head angrily.\n\n\"Oh, I understood it all right. I thought it was silly.\"\n\n\"You did? Read me your own.\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nNow Clare, as she corrected and commented upon the weekly essays, did\noccasionally, if the mood took her, read extracts, humorous chiefly,\ntherefrom; but it had never been customary for a pupil to read her own\nwork aloud. Agatha had the pioneer spirit--but she was no fool. She\ncomprehended that, with Clare inimical, she could climb no higher than\nthe pillory. She fell back upon the tradition of the school.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Hartill--I can't!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"No one ever does----\"\n\nClare waited.\n\nAgatha protested redly, her fear of ridicule outweighing her fear of\nClare.\n\n\"Miss Hartill, I simply couldn't. Before everybody--all this tosh--I\nmean all this stuff I wrote. It's a written essay. I couldn't make it\nsound right aloud.\"\n\nClare waited.\n\n\"It's not good enough, Miss Hartill. Honestly! And we never have. You've\nnever made us. I couldn't.\"\n\nClare waited.\n\nAgatha twisted her hands uneasily. The schoolgirl shyness that is\nphysical misery was upon her.\n\n\"I--don't want to, Miss Hartill. I can't. It's not fair to have one's\nstuff--to be laughed at--to be----\" she subsided just in time.\n\nThe class sat, breathless, all eyes on Clare.\n\nAnd Clare waited; waited till defiance faded to unease--unease to\nhelplessness, till the girl, overborne by the utter silence, gave way,\nand dropping her eyes to her exercise, fluttering its pages in angry\nembarrassment, finally, with a giggle of pure nervousness, embarked on\nthe opening sentence.\n\nClare cut through the clustering adjectives.\n\n\"Stand up, please.\"\n\nResistance was over. She rose sullenly.\n\nShe had been proud of her essay, had worked at it sincerely, knew its\nperiods by heart. But her pleasure in it was destroyed, as completely,\nshe realised, as she had destroyed that of little Louise. More--for\nLouise had found a champion. That, she recognised jealously. Unjust! Her\nessay was no worse, read soberly--yet she was forced to render it\nridiculous. She read a couple of pages in hurried jerks, stumbling over\nthe illegibilities of her own handwriting, baulked by Clare's\ninterpolations. She heard her own voice, high-pitched and out of\ncontrol, perverting her meaning, felt the laden sentences breaking up\ninto chaos on her lips. In her flurry she pronounced familiar words\namiss, Clare's calm voice carefully correcting. Once she heard a\nchuckle. Two pages ... three ... only that ... she remembered that she\nhad boasted of twenty ... seventeen to be read yet and they were all\nlaughing. To have to stand there ... three pages.... \"_But as Childe\nRoland turned round_----\"\n\n\"Louder, please,\" said Clare.\n\n\"_But as Childe Roland turned round_----\" and even Marion was\nlaughing.... \"_Turned round to look once more back to the high\nroad_----\"\n\n\"And slower.\"\n\n\"_To the high road_----\" She stopped suddenly, a lump in her throat.\n\n\"Go on, Agatha.\"\n\n\"_To the high road_----\" The letters danced up and down mistily. \"_To\nthe high road where the cripple--where the cripple_----Oh, Miss\nHartill,\" she cried imploringly, \"isn't it enough?\"\n\nIt was surrender. Clare nodded.\n\n\"Yes, you may sit down now. Your essay, please: thank you. And now I'll\nread you, once more, what Louise has to say on the same subject. I dare\nsay you'll find, Agatha, that you were almost as unfair to her essay, as\nyou were to--your own.\" And she smiled her sudden dazzling smile.\nAgatha, against her will, smiled tremulously back.\n\nClare, with a glance at the little figure, huddling at the foot of the\ntable, began to read. The essay, for all its schoolgirl slips and\nextravagances, was unusual. The thought embodied in it, though tinged\nwith morbidity, striking and matured. Clare did it more than justice.\nHer beautiful voice made music of the crude sentences, revealed,\nembellished, glorified. Her own interest growing as she read, infected\nthe class; she swept them along with her, mutually enthusiastic. She\nended abruptly, her voice like the echoes of a deep bell.\n\nMarion broke the little pause.\n\n\"I liked that,\" she said, as if surprised at herself.\n\n\"So did I,\" Clare was pleased.\n\nShe dipped her pen in red ink and initialled the foot of the essay.\n\n\"That was good work, Louise. Now, the others.\"\n\nBut Louise, shy and glowing, broke in--\n\n\"But it wasn't all mine, Miss Hartill, not a bit.\"\n\nClare looked at her, half frowning.\n\n\"Not yours? Your handwriting----?\"\n\n\"Oh, I wrote it. But you've made it different. I hadn't meant it like\nthat.\"\n\nClare raised a quizzical eyebrow.\n\n\"I have misinterpreted----?\"\n\nLouise was too much in earnest to be fluttered.\n\n\"I only mean--you made it sound so beautiful that it was like listening\nto--to an organ. I didn't bother about the words while you read. It was\nall colours and gold--like the things in the Venetian room. You know.\nThe meaning didn't matter. But I did mean something, not half so good,\nof course, only quite different. Horrid and grizzly like the plain he\ntravelled through, Childe Roland. It ought to have sounded harsh and\nstarved, like rats pattering--what I meant--not beautiful.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Clare was interested. She was quite aware that she had used her\nmagnificent voice to impress arbitrarily her opinion of Louise's work\nupon the class. That Louise, impressionable as she knew her to be,\nshould have yet detected the trick, amused her greatly.\n\n\"So you think I didn't understand your essay?\"\n\nLouise's shy laugh was very pleasant.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Hartill. I'm not so stupid. It's only that I can't have got\nthe--the----\"\n\n\"Atmosphere!\" The girl in spectacles helped her.\n\n\"The atmosphere that I meant to; so you put in a different one to help\nit. And it did. But it wasn't what I meant.\"\n\nClare glanced at her inscrutably, and began to score the other essays.\nShe would get at Louise's meaning in her own way. She skimmed a couple,\nAgatha, be it recorded, receiving the coveted initials, before she spoke\nagain.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you to learn _Childe Roland_, too? Ah, I thought so.\nBegin, Marion, while I finish these. Two verses.\"\n\nHer pen scratched on, as Marion's expressionless voice rose, fell and\nfinished. Agatha continued, jarringly dramatic. Two more followed her.\nThen Clare put down her pen.\n\n     \"'For mark!'...\"\n\nThere was a warning undertone in Louise's colourless voice, that crept\nacross the room like a shadow. Clare lifted her head and stared at her.\n\n     \"For mark! no sooner was I fairly found\n     Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,\n     Than, pausing to throw backward a last view\n     O'er the safe road, 'twas gone; grey plain all round:\n     Nothing but plain to the horizon's bound.\n     I might go on; nought else remained to do.\"\n\nThere was horror in the whispering voice: the accents of one bowed\nbeneath intolerable burdens, sick with the knowledge of nearing doom,\ngay with the flippancy of despair. Louise was looking straight before\nher, vacant as a medium, her hands lying laxly in her lap. Clare made a\nquick sign to her neighbour to be silent, and the strained voice rose\nanew.\n\nClare listened perplexedly. She told herself that this was sheer\ntechnique--some trick had been played, she was harbouring some child\nactress of parts--only to be convinced of folly. She knew all about\nLouise. Besides, she had heard the child read aloud before. Good, clean,\nintelligent delivery. But nothing like this--this was uncanny. Uncanny,\nyet magnificent. The artist in her settled down to enjoyment; yet she\nwas uneasy, too.\n\n     \"And just as far as ever from the end!\"\n\nThe creeping voice toiled on across the haunted plain, growing louder,\nclearer, nearer.\n\nVision was forced upon Clare, serene in her form-room, swift and sudden\nvision. She not only heard, every sense responded. At her feet lay the\nwaste land of the poem, she smelt the dank air, shrank from the clammy\nundergrowth, watched the bowed figure of the wandering knight,\nstumbling forwards doggedly. It was coming towards her, the outline\nblurred in the evening mist, the face hidden. The voice was surely his?\n\n     \"Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it tolled\n     Increasing like a bell.\"\n\nShe heard it alive with warning.\n\nNearer, ever nearer; the bowed form was at her very feet, as the voice\nrose anew in despairing defiance.\n\n     \"To view the last of me----\"\n\nThe helmeted head was flung back; the voice echoed from hill to hill--\n\n     \"I saw them and I knew them all. And yet\n     Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,\n     And blew. Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.\"\n\nThe figure fell, face upwards, at her feet. Clare tore at the visor with\ndesperate hands, for at the last line, the strong voice had broken,\nquavering into the pitiful treble of a frightened child. The bars melted\nunder her touch, as dream things will, and she was staring down at no\nbearded face, but at Louise. Louise herself, with blank, dead eyes in a\nbroken, blood-flecked face. The dead mouth smiled.\n\n\"You see, that was what I meant, Miss Hartill. That atmosphere.\"\n\nClare roused herself with a start. Louise, rosily alive, and quivering\nwith eagerness, was waiting for her comments. She got none.\n\n\"Begin again,\" said Clare mechanically, to the next girl.\n\nThe brightness died out of Louise's face, as she subsided in her seat.\nClare, dazed as she was, saw it, and was touched. The child deserved\npraise--should not be punished for the vagaries of Clare's own phantasy.\nAnd the monkey could recite! She shook off the impression of that\nrecital as best she could. Curious, the freaks of the imagination! She\nmust tell Alwynne of the adventure--Alwynne, dreamer of dreams.... And\nAlwynne was interested in Louise; was coaching her.... Perhaps she was\nresponsible ... had coached her in that very poem? She hoped not ... it\nwould be interference.... She did not like interference. But no--that\nperformance was entirely original, she felt sure. There was genius in\nthe child--sheer genius ... and but for Clare herself, she would yet be\nrotting undeveloped in the Lower Third. She was pleased with herself,\npleased with Louise too; ready to tell her so, to see the child's face\nlight up again delightedly; she was less attractive in repose....\n\nClare's chance came.\n\nIt was the turn of the hockey captain to recite. She appealed to Clare.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Hartill! You said I needn't, Louise and I--because of all our\nextra work. Not the poem.\"\n\nClare considered.\n\n\"I remember. Very well. But Louise?\" She looked at her questioningly,\nhalf smiling. \"When did you find the time?\"\n\nLouise laughed.\n\n\"I don't know, Miss Hartill. It found itself.\"\n\n\"Ah! And how much extra work have you, Louise?\"\n\nLouise reflected.\n\n\"All the afternoons, I think. And three evenings when I go to lectures.\nAnd, of course, gallery days, when I make up in the evenings.\"\n\n\"And homework?\"\n\n\"Oh, there's heaps of time at night always.\"\n\nClare smiled upon her class.\n\n\"Well, Lower Fifth--what do you think of it?\"\n\nThe class opened its mouth.\n\n\"Louise is moved up four forms. She's thirteen. She's top of the class\nand first in to-day's results. You hear what her extra work is. And she\nfinds time to learn _Childe Roland_--optional. What do you think of it?\"\n\nAgatha bit down her envy.\n\n\"It's pretty good,\" she said.\n\nClare's glance approved her.\n\n\"Yes. So I think. It's so good that I'm more than pleased.\nI'm--impressed. Rather proud of my youngest pupil. For next time you\nwill learn----\" And with one of her quick transitions, she began to\ndictate her homework.\n\nThe gong clanged as she finished. Alwynne's voice was heard in the\npassage, inquiring for Miss Hartill, and Clare hurried out. Followed a\nconfused banging of books and desk-lids, a tangle of fragmentary\nremarks, and much trampling of boots on uncarpeted boards, as one after\nanother followed her. Within five minutes the room was bare, save for\nClare's forgotten satchel at the upper end of the big table, and Louise,\nmotionless in her chair at the foot.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nLouise was tasting happiness.\n\nHappiness was a new and absorbing experience to Louise. The only child\nof a former marriage, she had grown up among boisterous half-brothers\nwith whom she had little fellowship. Her father, a driving, thriving\nmerchant, was prouder of his second brood of apple-cheeked youngsters\nthan of his first-born, who fitted into the scheme of life as ill as her\nmother had done. He had imagined himself in love with his first wife,\nhad married her, piqued by her elusive ways, charmed by her pale,\nwood-sorrel beauty; and she, shy and unawakened, had taken his six feet\nof bone and muscle for outward and visible sign of the matured spiritual\nstrength her nature needed. The disappointment was mutual as swift; it\nhad taken no longer than the honeymoon to convince the one that he had\nburdened himself with a phantast, the other that she was tied to a\nphilistine. For a year they shared bed and board, severed and\ninseparable as earth and moon; then the wife having passed on to a\ndaughter the heritage of a nature rare and impracticable as a sensitive\nplant, died and was forgotten.\n\nThe widower's speedy re-marriage proved an unqualified success. Indeed,\nthe worthy man's after life was so uniformly and deservedly prosperous\n(he was as shrewd and industrious in his business as he was genial and\ndomesticated in his home), that he might be forgiven if his affection\nfor his eldest child were tepid; for, apart from her likeness to his\nfirst wife, she was, in existing, a constant reminder of the one mistake\nof a prosperous career. He was kind to her, however, in his fashion;\ngave her plenty of pocket-money (he was fond of giving); saw to it that\nshe had a sufficiency of toys and sweets, though it piqued him that she\nhad never been known to ask for any. Otherwise was content to leave her\nto his wife.\n\nThe second Mrs. Denny, kindly, capable and unimaginative as her husband,\nhad her sense of duty to her step-daughter; but she was too much\noccupied in bearing and rearing her own family, whose numbers were\naugmented with Victorian regularity, to consider more than the physical\nwell-being of the child. Louise was well fed and warmly clad, her share\nwas accorded her in the pleasures of the nursery. What more could a busy\nwoman do!\n\nLouise, docile and reserved, was not unhappy. Until she went to school,\nhowever, her mental outlook resembled that of a person suffering from\nmyopia. Her elders, her half-brothers, all the persons of her small\nworld, were indefinite figures among whom she moved, confused and\nblundering. She knew of their existence, but to focus them seemed as\nimpossible as to establish communication. She did not try over hard; she\nwas sensitive to ridicule; it was easier to retire within her childish\nself, be her own confidante and questioner.\n\nShe had an intricate imagination and before she learned to read had\ncreated for herself a fantastically complete inner world, in which she\nmoved, absorbed and satisfied. Indeed, her outward surroundings became\nat last so dangerously shadowy that her manner began to show how entire\nwas her abstraction, and Mrs. Denny, sworn foe to \"sulks\" and \"moping,\"\nsaw fit to engage a governess as an antidote.\n\nThe governess, a colourless lady, achieved little, though she was useful\nin taking the little boys for walks. But she taught Louise to read, and\nthereafter the child assumed entire charge of her own education.\n\nThe mother's books, velvety with dust that had sifted down upon them\nsince the day, six years back, when they had been tumbled in piles on an\nattic floor by busy maids preparing for the advent of the second Mrs.\nDenny, were discovered, one rainy day, by a pinafored Siegfried, alert\nfor treasure. Contented years were passed in consuming the trove.\n\nHer mother's choice of books was so completely to her taste that they\ngave the lonely child her first experience of mental companionship;\nsuggesting to her that there might be other intelligences in the world\nabout her than the kindly, stolid folk who cherished her growing body\nand ignored her growing mind. She was almost startled at times to\nrealise how completely this vague mother of hers would have understood\nher. Each new volume, fanciful or quizzical or gracious, seemed a direct\ngift from an invisible yet human personality, that concerned itself with\nher as no other had ever done; that was never occupied with the\ndustiness of the attic, or a forgotten tea-hour, but was astonishingly\nsensitive to the needs of a little soul, struggling unaided to birth.\nThe pile of books, to her hungry affections, became the temple, the\nveritable dwelling-place of her mother's spirit.\n\nSeated on the sun-baked floor, book on knee, the noises of the high road\nfloating up to her, distance-dulled and soothing, she would shake her\nthick hair across her face, and see through its veil a melting, shifting\nshadow of a hand that helped to turn her pages. The warm floor was a\nsoft lap; the battered trunk a shoulder that supported; the faint breeze\na kiss upon her lips. The fantastic qualities the mother had bequeathed,\nrecreated her in the mind of her child, bringing vague comfort (who\nknows?) alike to the dead and the living Louise.\n\nYet the impalpable intercourse, compact of make-believe and yearnings,\nwas, at its sweetest, no safe substitute for the human companionships\nthat were lacking in the life of Louise. Half consciously she desired an\nelder sister, a friend, on whom to lavish the stores of her ardent,\nreticent nature.\n\nAt twelve she was sent to school. At first it did little for her. She\nwas unaccustomed to companions of her own age and sex and, quite simply,\ndid not know how to make friends with many who would have been willing\nenough, if she could have contributed her share, the small change of\njoke and quarrel and confidence, towards intimacy. But Louise was too\ninured to the solitude of crowds to be troubled by her continued\nloneliness. She met the complaints of Mrs. Denny, that she made no\nfriends like other children, with a shrug of resignation. What could she\ndo? She supposed that she was not nice enough; people didn't like her.\n\nSecretly her step-mother agreed. She was kind to Louise, but she, too,\ndid not like her. She found her irritating. Her dreamy, absent manner,\nher very docility and absence of self-assertion were annoying to a\nhearty woman who was braced rather than distressed by an occasional\nbattle of wills. She thought her shyness foolish, doubted the\ninsincerity of her humility, and looked upon her shrinking from\npublicity, noise and rough caresses, her love of books and solitude, as\na morbid pose. Yet she was just a woman and did not let the child guess\nat her dislike, though she made no pretence of actual affection. She\nknew perfectly well that Louise's mother (they had been schoolgirls\ntogether), had irritated her in exactly the same way.\n\nEducationally, too, the first year at school affected Louise but\nslightly. Her brothers' governesses had done their best for the shy,\nintelligent girl, and her wide reading had trained, her awkwardness and\nchildish appearance obscured, a personality in some respects dangerously\nmatured. But her dreaminess and total ignorance of the routine of\nlesson-learning hampered her curiously; she learnt mechanically, using\nher brain but little for her easy tasks, and she was not considered\nparticularly promising.\n\nWith Clare's intervention the world was changed for Louise; she had her\nfirst taste of active pleasure.\n\nIt is difficult to realise what an effect a woman of Clare's temperament\nmust have had on the impressionable child. In her knowledge, her\nenthusiasms, her delicate intuition and her keen intellectual sympathy,\nshe must have seemed the embodiment of all dreams, the fulfilment of\nevery longing, the ideal made flesh. A wanderer in an alien land,\nhomesick, hungry, for whom, after weary days, a queen descends from her\nthrone, speaking his language, supplying his unvoiced wants, might feel\nsomething of the adoring gratitude that possessed Louise. She rejoiced\nin Clare as a vault-bred flower in sunlight.\n\nOn all human beings, child or adult, emotional adventure entails, sooner\nor later, physical exhaustion; the deeper, the more novel the\nexperience, the greater the drain on the bodily strength. To Louise,\ninvolved in the first passionate experience of her short life, in an\naffection as violent and undisciplined as a child's must be, an\naffection in itself completely occupying her mind and exhausting her\nenergies, the amount of work made necessary by the position to which\nClare and her own ambition had assigned her, was more of a burden than\neither realised. Only Alwynne, sympathetic coach (for Louise had two\nyears' back work to condense and assimilate), guessed how great were the\nefforts the child was making. Clare, who always affected unconsciousness\nof her own effect on the ambitions of the children, had persuaded\nherself that Louise was entirely in her right place; and Louise herself\nwas too young, and too feverishly happy, to consider the occasional\nheadaches, fits of lassitude and nights cinematographed with dreams, as\nanything but irritating pebbles in her path to success--and Clare.\n\nThe weeks in her new class had been spread with happiness--a happiness\nthat had grown like Elijah's cloud, till, on the day of the Browning\nlesson, as she listened to the beloved voice making music of her halting\nsentences, to the words of praise, of affection even, that followed, it\nstretched from horizon to horizon.\n\nAs she sat in the deserted class-room, her neat packet of sandwiches\nuntasted in the satchel at her elbow, she re-lived that golden hour,\ndwelling on its incidents as a miser counts money. There was the stormy\nbeginning; Agatha's mockery; her own raging helplessness; Clare's\nentrance; the exquisite thrill she had felt at her touch, that was not\nonly gratitude for championship.... Never before had Clare been so near\nto her, so gentle, so protecting.... And afterwards, facing Louise at\nthe foot of the table, how beautiful she had been.... Yet some of the\ngirls could not see it.... They were fools.... Her head had been framed\nin the small, square window, so darkened and cobwebbed by crimson vines\nthat only the merest blur of white clouds and blue hills was visible....\nShe had worn a gown of duller blue that lay in stiff folds: the bowl of\nChristmas roses, that mirrored themselves on the dark, polished table,\nhad hidden the papers and the smeared ink-pot. Suddenly Louise\nremembered some austere Dutch Madonnas over whom delightful, but erratic\nMiss Durand had lingered, on their last visit to a picture gallery. She\ncalled them beautiful. Louise, with fascinated eyes sidling past a\nwallful of riotous Rubens, to fix on the soap and gentian of a\nSasseferato, had wondered if Miss Durand were trying to be funny. She\nremembered, too, how some of the younger girls, comparing favourites,\nhad called Miss Hartill ugly. She had raged loyally--yet, secretly, all\nbut agreed. With her child's love of pink and white prettiness she had\nhad no eyes for Clare's irregular features. But to-day something in\nClare's pose had recalled the Dutch pictures, and in a flash she had\nunderstood, and wondered at her blindness. Miss Durand was right: the\ndrawn, grey faces and rigid outlines had beauty, had charm--the charm of\nher stern smile.... The saints were hedged with lilies, and she, too,\nhad had white flowers before her, that filled the air with the smell of\nthe marvellous Roman church at Westminster.... The painted ladies were\nMadonnas--mothers--and Miss Hartill, too, had worn for a moment their\nprotective look, half fierce, half tender....\n\nWhy was it? What has made her so kind? Not only to-day, but always? The\ngirls feared her, some of them; those that she did not like talked of\nher temper and her tongue; Rose Levy hated her; even Agatha and Marion,\nand all of them, were a little frightened, though they adored....\nLouise was never frightened.... How could one be frightened of one so\nkind and wonderful? She could say what she liked to Miss Hartill, and be\nsure that she would understand.... It was like being in the attic,\ntalking aloud.... Mother would have been like that.... If it could\nbe....\n\nLouise, her chin in her doubled fists, launched out upon her sea of\nmake-believe.\n\nIf it could be.... If it were possible, that Mother--not Mamma, cheery,\nobtuse Mamma of nursery and parlour--but Mother, the shadow of the\nattic--had come back? All things are possible to him that believeth: and\nMr. Chesterton had said there was no real reason why tulips should not\ngrow on oaks.... Heaps of people--all India--believed in reincarnation,\nand there was _The Gateless Barrier_ and _The Dead Leman_ for proof....\nMight it not be?\n\nThe idea was intoxicating. She did not actually believe in it, but she\nplayed with it, wistfully, letting her imagination run riot. She wove\nfantastic variations on the themes \"why not,\" \"perhaps,\" \"who knows.\"\n\nShe was but thirteen and very lonely.\n\nShe was in far too exalted a mood to have an appetite for her\nsandwiches, or time for the books beside her. She was due for extra work\nwith Alwynne at three, and the intervening hour should have been used\nfor preparation. Wasting her time meant sitting up at night, as Louise\nwas well aware, and a tussle with Mrs. Denny, concerned for the waste of\ngas. But for all that, she would not and could not rouse herself from\nthe trance of pleasure that was upon her. Her mind was contemplating\nClare as a mystic contemplates his divinity; rapt in an ecstasy of\nadoration, oblivious alike of place and time. She did not hear the\nluncheon gong, or the gong for afternoon school, or a door, opening and\nshutting behind her. Yet it did not startle her, when, turning dreamily\nto tap on her shoulder, she found herself facing Miss Hartill herself.\nMiss Hartill should have left the school before lunch, she knew, but it\nwas all in order. What could surprise one on this miraculous day? She\ndid not even rise, as etiquette demanded; but she smiled up at Clare\nwith an expression of welcoming delight that disarmed comment.\n\nClare, too, could ignore conventions. She was merely touched and amused\nby the child's expression.\n\n\"Well, Louise? Very busy?\"\n\nLouise glanced vaguely at her books.\n\n\"Yes. I ought to be, I mean. I don't believe I've touched anything. I\nwas thinking----\"\n\n\"Two hours on end? Do you know the time? I heard Miss Durand clamouring\nfor you just now.\" Clare looked mischievous. She could forgive\nforgetfulness of other people's classes.\n\nLouise was serene.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I'd forgotten. I must go.\"\n\nBut she made no movement. She sat looking at Miss Hartill as if nothing\nelse existed for her. The intent, fearless adoration in her eyes was\nvery pleasant to Clare; novel, too, after the more sophisticated glances\nof the older girls.\n\nWith an odd little impulse of motherliness she picked up Louise's books,\nstacked them neatly and fitted them into the satchel. Louise watched\nher. Miss Hartill buckled the strap and handed her the bundle.\n\n\"There you are, Louise! Run along, my child, I'm afraid you'll get a\nscolding.\" She stooped to her, bright-eyed, laughing. \"And what were you\nthinking of, Louise, for two long hours?\"\n\n\"You,\" said Louise simply.\n\nA touch of colour stole into Clare's thin cheeks. She took the small\nface between her hands and kissed it lightly.\n\n\"Silly child!\" said Miss Hartill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nAlwynne, drumming with her fingers on the window-sill, as she stood by\nLouise's desk, was distinctly annoyed. Louise, for the first time since\nshe had known her, was late. It was, indeed, not one of her assigned\nclasses; but she and Louise had found their hours together so\ninsufficient for all the work that they were trying to make good, that\nAlwynne had good-naturedly arranged to give her a daily extra lesson. It\nbit into Alwynne's meagre free time; but she was fond of Louise; proud\nof her, too; and there was Clare! Clare was so anxious for Louise's\nsuccess. Clare had been so pleased with the plan....\n\nPerhaps it was natural that Alwynne, as she made the arrangement, forgot\nto consult Elsbeth. She told her about it afterwards, and Elsbeth\npraised her for her unselfishness, and was anxious lest she should be\novertired. She did not remind Alwynne that she was alone all day; that\nshe had been accustomed to look forward to the gay tea-hour, when\nAlwynne returned, full of news and nonsense. She resigned herself\ncheerfully to a solitary meal, and to keeping the muffins hot against\nAlwynne's uncertain home-coming.\n\nThe extra lessons had been a real boon to Louise, and she had grown\nattached to Alwynne and intimate with her. Alwynne's elder-sisterly\nattitude to the children she taught, although it horrified the older\nwomen, was seldom abused; it merely made her the recipient of quaint\nconfidences, and gave her an insight into the characters of her pupils\nthat was invaluable to girls and governess alike. To developing girls a\nconfidante is a necessity. The present boarding-school system of\neducation ousts the mother from that, her natural position; renders her,\nto the daughter steeped in an alien atmosphere, an outsider, lacking\nall understanding. Invaluable years pass before the artificial gulf that\nboarding-school creates between them, is spanned. And the substitute for\nthe only form of sympathy and interest that is entirely untainted by\nselfish impulses is usually the chance acquaintance, the neighbour of\ndesk and bedroom; occasionally, very occasionally, for the girl's\nfeverish admiration usually precludes sane acquaintanceship, a mistress\nof more than average insight. Such a mistress, Alwynne, in spite of, or\nperhaps because of, her youthful indiscretions of manner, was in a fair\nway to become.\n\nAnd of all the children who had opened their affairs to her, none had\nexperienced more completely the tonic effect of a kind heart and a sense\nof humour, than Louise.\n\nShe would come to her lesson, overtired from the strain of the morning\nclasses, over-stimulated from the contact with Clare, over-hopeful or\nutterly depressed, as the mood took her. Alwynne's cheerful interest was\nbalm to the child's overwrought nerves. Alwynne let her spend a quarter\nof an hour or more in confiding the worries and excitements of the day,\nafter which, Louise, curiously revived, contrived to get through an\namazing amount of work. There was no doubt as to Louise's capacity for\nadvanced work, but her state of mind affected her output; she was, as\nAlwynne once phrased it to Clare, \"like a violin--you had to tune her up\nbefore she was fit for use.\" And Alwynne's \"tuning\" had done more than\nshe or Clare or even Louise herself had guessed, towards her success in\nher new class.\n\nBit by bit, Alwynne had heard all about Louise; the details of her\nmeagre home-life; her attitude to the busy world of school, that\nfrightened while it attracted her; her difficulties with her fellows;\nher delight in her work. Finally, there was Clare. Louise was very shy\nabout Clare; inclined to scent mockery, to be on the defensive; but\nAlwynne's own matter-of-fact enthusiasm had its effect. Also Alwynne's\ninterest, though it invited, never demanded confidences. It took Louise\nsome time to realise that it arose from simple friendliness of soul;\nthat there was neither curiosity nor pedagogic zeal behind it; that,\nthough she was teased and laughed at, she was respected, and, out of\nschool hours, treated as an equal; that she and her schoolgirl secrets\nwere safe with Miss Durand. It was, indeed, in the light of after\nevents, pathetic that Louise, dazzled by Clare's will-o'-the-wisp\nbrilliance, never realised how close to her for a season the friend, the\nelder sister she had longed for, really stood. With the egoism of a\nchild, and a child in love, she was humbly and passionately grateful for\nClare's least sign of interest, yet accepted all the many little\nkindnesses that Alwynne showed her, as a matter of course. She scarcely\nrealised, absorbed as she was in Clare, that she was even fond of Miss\nDurand, yet she relied on her implicitly: and Alwynne, innocent of the\njealous, acquisitive impulse that tainted Clare's intercourse with any\ngirl who caught her fancy, was not at all disturbed or hurt by Louise's\nattitude. She looked after the child as she would have looked after a\nstarving cat or a fugitive emperor, if they had come her way, as a\nmatter of course, and as instinctively as she ate her dinner.\n\nShe was thinking of Louise, as she sat waiting, and a little curious as\nto what the child would say to her. She had heard all about the Browning\nlesson, at lunch, from Rose Levy, whose veiled, epigrammatic malice was\nusually amusing. Agatha had been on her other side, and she had\nanticipated equally amusing protests and contradictions and a highly\ncoloured and totally different version. But Agatha had been unusually\nsubdued that morning. Both had made it apparent, however, that Clare had\nbeen more than a little pleased with Louise.\n\nBut, however triumphant Louise's morning might have been, she had no\nbusiness to be late now. What did she mean by keeping her waiting? Twice\nhad Alwynne been down to the preparation room, searching for her: she\ndid not mean to be impertinent of course, but it was, at least, casual.\nAlwynne, with easy, evanescent indignation, resolved to give Louise a\ntaste of her tongue.\n\nHere the child herself burst in upon her meditations, flushed to her\nglowing eyes, that were bright as if with drugs, excited as Alwynne had\nnever yet guessed that she could be, charged with some indefinable\nquality as a live wire is charged with electricity. She stammered her\napologies mechanically, sure of pardon, and, the formality complied\nwith, was eager, touchingly eager for questions and the relief of\ncommunication.\n\nBut Alwynne, at nineteen, could not be expected to forego a legitimate\ngrievance.\n\nShe read Louise a little lecture on punctuality and politeness, and\nsettled at once to the work in hand. She said, with intention, that they\nmust not waste any more time.\n\nLouise submitted with her usual meekness, and did, Alwynne could see, do\nher utmost to apply herself to her work. But her answers were\nludicrously vague and _mal \u00c3\u00a0 propos_, and she met Alwynne's comments,\nmomentarily sharper, with an abstracted smile.\n\nSuddenly Alwynne lost patience with her.\n\n\"I don't know what's the matter with you to-day, Louise,\" she said\nsharply. \"I don't believe you've taken in a word of what I've said. If\nyou can't take a little more trouble, I'd better go home.\"\n\nLouise, obviously and pathetically jerked back to consciousness from\nsome dreamer's Paradise, looked up at her with scared, apologetic eyes.\nThe radiance dimmed slowly from her face. She made no answer, only to\nput up her hand to her head, with a queer little gesture of\nhelplessness.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" demanded Alwynne, but already more gently.\nHer anger was always fleeting as a puff of smoke.\n\nBut Louise merely shrugged her shoulders and looked vaguely at her\nagain. Then she returned to her work.\n\nAlwynne, walking up and down the room watched her intently as she bent\nover the Latin grammar. She was wrinkling her brows over a piece of\nprose that she had already construed at the previous lesson, and with an\nease that had astonished Alwynne. She looked bewildered and put her hand\nto her head again. Her efforts to recall her wandering thoughts were\npatent and almost physical in their intensity; her small hand hovered,\ncontracting and relaxing, like a baby catching at butterflies.\n\nAlwynne was puzzled by her. The child was sincere: but obviously\nsomething momentous had happened, and was still occupying her, to the\nexclusion of all else. Alwynne wished that she had been less hasty: she\nfelt that she should not have checked her.\n\nShe stood a moment beside her, reading what she had written. It was\nscarcely legible, and made no sense. She put a hand on her shoulder--\n\n\"Louise, you are writing nonsense. What is it? Tell me what the matter\nis?\"\n\nLouise laid down her pen, gave her a quick, shy smile, hesitated\nuncertainly, then, to Alwynne's dismay, collapsed on the low desk in a\nfit of wild, hysterical crying.\n\nAlwynne always shed the mistress in emergency.\n\nShe whipped her arms about the child, and, sitting down, gathered her\ninto her lap. She felt how the little, thin body was wrenched and shaken\nby the sobs it did not attempt to control, but she said nothing, only\nheld it comfortingly tight.\n\nSlowly the paroxysm subsided, and the words came, jerky, fragmentary,\nfaint. Alwynne bent close to catch them.\n\nLouise was so sorry ... she was all right now ... Miss Durand must think\nher crazy. No--no--nothing wrong ... it was the other way round ... she\nwas so happy that it frightened her ... she was madly happy ... she had\nbeen in heaven all day ... it was too wonderful to tell any one\nabout ... even Miss Durand.... Miss Hartill--no one could ever know what\nMiss Hartill was.... She had been so good to her--so wonderful.... She\nhad made Louise so happy that she was frightened ... she couldn't\nbelieve it was possible to be so madly happy.... That was all.... Yes,\nit had made her cry--the pure happiness.... Wasn't it silly? Only she\nwas so dreadfully tired.... It had hurt her head trying to do the\nLatin--because she was so tired.... Yes, she had had headaches\nlately.... But she didn't care--it was worth it, to please Miss\nHartill.... It was queer that being so happy should make her want to\ncry; it was comical, wasn't it?\n\nShe began to laugh as she spoke, with tears brimming over her lashes,\nand for a few moments was inclined to be hysterical again.\n\nBut Alwynne's firm grasp and calm voice was too much for Louise's will,\nweakened by emotion and fatigue; she was soon coaxed and hushed into\nquiet again, and after lying passively for a while in Alwynne's arms,\nfell into the sudden light sleep of utter exhaustion.\n\nAlwynne, rocking her gently, sat on in the darkening room, without a\nthought of the passage of time; puzzling over the problem in her arms.\n\nShe was too ignorant and inexperienced to understand Louise's outburst,\nor to realise the dangerous strain that the child's sensibilities were\nundergoing but the touch of the little figure, clinging, nestling to\nher, stirred her. She was vaguely aware that something--somehow--was\namiss. Innocently she rejoiced that Clare was being kind to Louise, that\nthe child was so happy and content; but the complaint of fatigue, the\nfrequent headaches, troubled her. She would speak to Elsbeth.... Perhaps\nthe child needed a tonic? Elsbeth would know....\n\nShe glanced down. How different people looked asleep.... She had never\nbefore realised how young Louise was. What was she? Thirteen? But what a\nbaby she looked, with her thin, child's shape and small, clutching\nhands.... It was the long-lashed lids that did it, hiding the beautiful\neyes that were so much older, as she saw now, than the rest of Louise.\nWith her soul asleep, Louise looked ten, and a frail little ghost of\nten, at that.\n\nAlwynne frowned. She supposed Clare Hartill realised how young Louise\nwas, was right in allowing her to work so hard? But Clare knew all about\ngirls, and what did she, Alwynne, know? After all Louise had never\nflagged before.... It was probably the usual end of term fatigue--and of\ncourse it was necessarily an unusually stiff three months for her....\nShe needed a holiday.... Next term would come more easily to her, poor\nlittle impetuous Louise.... Alwynne realised that she was growing fond\nof the child.\n\nSuddenly she heard footsteps in the corridor, and her own name in\nClare's impatient accents. Louise, too, roused at the sound, and,\njerking herself upright, slid from Alwynne's lap to her feet, as the\ndoor opened and the light was switched on with a snap. Clare stood in\nthe doorway.\n\nSerenely Alwynne rose, smoothing the creases in her dress, while with\nthe other hand she steadied Louise, swaying and blinking in the strong\nlight. Clare's sharp eyes appreciated her calm no less than the\ntear-stains on Louise's cheek; she guessed distortedly at the situation.\nShe bit her lip. She found nothing to be annoyed at, yet she was not\npleased.\n\n\"Alwynne! I've been hunting for you high and low. I thought you were\ncoming home to tea with me.\"\n\nAlwynne beamed at her.\n\n\"Of course! And do you know, I forgot to tell Elsbeth. Isn't it\ndisgraceful? But I'm coming.\"\n\nShe turned to Louise.\n\n\"My dear, run along home, and get to bed early; you look dreadfully\ntired. Doesn't she, Miss Hartill?\"\n\nBut Clare was already in the passage.\n\nAlwynne hurried after her, with a last cheerful nod, and Louise heard\nthe echo of their footsteps die away in the distance.\n\nStill dazed and heavy with sleep, her thoughts obscured and chaotic,\nshe sat down again stupidly at her desk in the alcove of the window. She\nleaned her forehead against the cold pane and looked out.\n\nIt was a wild night. The wind soughed and shrieked in the bare trees:\nthe rain tore past in gusts; the lamp-post at the corner was mirrored in\nthe wet pavement, like a moon on an oily sea.\n\nLouise pushed open the casement. The wind lulled as she did so, and she\nlent out. The air, at least, was mild, and a faint back-wash of rain\nsprayed soothingly upon her hot cheeks and swollen eyes.\n\nSlowly her thoughts shaped themselves. So the day was over--the happiest\nday she had ever had.... She thought God was very wonderful to have made\nsuch a woman as Miss Hartill. She sent Him a hasty little prayer of\nthanks. But she had been very foolish that afternoon.... She could not\nunderstand it now.... She hoped Miss Durand would not tell Miss\nHartill.... Miss Hartill had been in a great hurry! Was that why she had\nnot said good-night to her? But such a little word. She wondered why\nMiss Hartill had not said good-night to her....\n\nThe front door below the window creaked and opened. Louise peered\ndownwards. Miss Durand and Miss Hartill came down the steps sheltering\nunder one umbrella, talking. Their voices floated up.\n\n\"I hope you don't spoil her, Alwynne? Yes, I know----\" Alwynne was\nmurmuring friendly adjectives. \"But a mistress is in a peculiar\nposition. You should not let yourself be too familiar----\" A gust of\nwind and rain whirling down the road bore away the rest of the sentence.\n\nLouise shut the window. She shivered a little as she gathered up her\nbooks.\n\nHer happiest day was over.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nA week before Christmas Alwynne began to wonder how the day itself\nshould be spent, or rather, if her plans for the spending would ever\npass Elsbeth's censorship. She was doubtful. For the last two or three\nyears Christmas had been to them a rock of collision.\n\n\"The pity of it!\" thought Alwynne. Once it had been the event, the\ncrowning glory, the very reason of the ending year. A year, indeed, had\nalways presented itself to her in advance as a wide country through\nwhich she must make her way, to reach the hostel, Christmas, hidden in\nthe mists of time, on its further border. She had the whole map of the\nland in her mind, curiously vivid and distinct. She had never\nconsciously devised the picture; it had, from the first, presented\nitself complete and unalterable. She stood, on New Year's Day, at the\nentrance of a country lane which ran between uneven hedges through a\nvarying countryside of fields and woods and heatherland. Each change in\nthe surroundings represented a month, the smaller differences the weeks\nand days. She went down this winding lane as the days went by, in slow\ncontent. January was a silent expanse of high tableland, snow-bound to\nthe horizon. Winding down hill through the sodden grassland of the bare\nFebruary country, where she lighted on nothing but early parsnip fronds\nand sleepy celandine buds in the dripping wickery hedges, she passed at\nlast into the wood of March, a wood of pollard hazels and greening oaks\nand bramble-guarded dingles, where the anemones grew, and the first\nprimroses. She slipped and slithered in and out of mossy leaf-pits, and\nthe briars clawed her hair and pinafore, as she robbed the primrose\nclumps with wet, reddened fingers. The wind shrieked overhead and\nwrestled wildly with the bare branches, but beyond there was blue sky\nand a drift of cloud. But, unawares, she would always head through the\nwood to where the trees grew thinner and dash out at last, through a\nmist of pale cuckoo-pint, into the cowslip field that was April.\n\nThe path ran on through May and June between fields of ox-eye daisies\nand garden roses, always down hill, till she tumbled into August, the\ndeep hot valley. There she found the sea.\n\nWith September the road lifted steadily, growing stony and ever steeper.\nIt wound on ahead of her like a silver thread through a brocade of red\nand gold and purple, that was heather and bracken and beech. But the\nbeech blossoms could never be gathered; they fell apart into a shower of\ndull leaves, and left her with a branch of bare twigs in her hand. The\nbriony berries that she twisted into wreaths stained her straw hat with\ntheir black, evil juice; even the manna-like old-man's-beard smelled\nsour and rotten. The decaying, witchlike beauty of the season tricked\nand frightened her; autumn was a hard hill to climb.\n\nBut far away, on the summit of that difficult hill, stood a house. An\nold house, gaily bricked, dressed in ivy, with a belfry from which\ncarols rang out unceasingly. It was always night-time where it stood and\ncheerful lights were set in every window. Alwynne never saw the house\ntill she had turned the bend of the road into November; then it faced\nher suddenly and she would wave to the distant windows with a thrill of\nexcitement, and quicken her steps, with the goal of the journey in sight\nat last. There was yet a weary climb before it was reached; every day of\nDecember was a boulder, painfully beclambered. But she would come to the\ngates at last, and tear up the frosty drive, from the shadow of whose\nshrubberies Jacob Marley peered and clanked at her and ghosts of\nChristmas turkeys gobbled horribly, to the open holly-hung doorway where\nSanta Claus, authentic in beard and dressing-gown, welcomed her with\nElsbeth's voice. Followed stay-at-home days of delirious merry-making,\nfrom which she awoke a week later, to find herself, her back to a closed\ndoor, a spent cracker in her hand, looking out again, eager and a little\nwistful, across the white untrodden plain of yet another January.\n\nBut ever the next Christmas beckoned her anew.\n\nTo Elsbeth, too, Christmas was the day of delights, and Alwynne the\nqueen of it. To Elsbeth, too, the pleasure of it began many weeks\nearlier in the secret fashioning of quaint gifts and surprises, and the\nanticipation of the small niece's delight in them. Elsbeth would have\ncheerfully cut off one of her slim fingers if Alwynne had happened to\ncovet it. The childless woman loved Alwynne--the child in Alwynne she\nworshipped.\n\nBut though the delight of actual motherhood was denied Elsbeth, she was\nspared none of its chagrins.\n\nStooping for years to a child's level, she was cruelly shaken when\nAlwynne, suddenly and inexplicably, as it always seems, grew up. It took\nElsbeth almost as many years to straighten herself again. Years when\nAlwynne, in the arrogance of her enterprising youth, thought that\nElsbeth was sometimes awfully childish. She supposed that she was\ngrowing old; she used not to be like that....\n\nThereafter, each Christmas, challenging comparison as it did with the\nmemory-mellowed charm of its forerunners, emphasised the change that had\ntaken place. Yearly the ideal Christmas lured them to the old\nobservances; yearly the reality satisfied them less.\n\nElsbeth still sat up half the night on Christmas Eve, at work upon the\nlittle tree. Alwynne still planned gorgeous and laborious presents for\nher aunt. Elsbeth still filled a stocking (out-size) with tip-toe\nsecrecy, and Alwynne, at sixteen, still ran across in her dressing-gown,\nand curled up on Elsbeth's bed to unpack it.\n\nBut at sixteen one is too old and too young to be a child any more. The\ntree was a fir-tree, pure and simple; the fairy lights stank of tallow;\nand not even for the sake of a new bright sixpence, would Alwynne, in\nthe thick of a vegetarian fad, devour a slice of the evil-coloured\nChristmas pudding.\n\nElsbeth, as she saw her old-time jokes and small surprises that could no\nlonger surprise, fall utterly flat, thought that school had altered\nAlwynne altogether; that she was assuming airs of maturity ridiculous in\na child of her age, (\"Sixteen? She's a mere baby still,\" affirmed poor\nElsbeth,) that she was growing indifferent, superior, heartless. And\nAlwynne, trying to appear amused, wondered why Christmas was so\ndifferent from what it used to be and wished heartily that Elsbeth would\nnot try to be skittish. It didn't suit her--made her seem undignified.\nEach, longing for the old days, when the other had conjured up so easily\nthe true spirit of the festival, tried her affectionate best to do so\nstill; each, failing inevitably, inevitably blamed the other. Neither\nrealised, that Dan Christmas is the god of very little children, and\nthat where they are not, he, too, does not linger.\n\nBut the last restless, unsatisfactory day had settled the matter for\nthem finally. Alwynne had fidgeted through morning service, and pained\nher aunt, on the walk home, with her sceptical young comments; had\nomitted to kiss her under the mistletoe; had sat through the ceremonious\nmeal, answering Elsbeth's cheerful pleasantries in monosyllables; and\nfinally, after an unguarded remark, and the inevitable reproving\ncomment, had flung out of the room in a fever of irritation. She came\nnear thinking Elsbeth a foolish and intolerable old maid. And Elsbeth,\nsitting sadly over the fire all the lonely afternoon, puzzled meekly\nover Alwynne's hardness of heart, and cried a little, in pure longing,\nfor the baby of a few years back, to whom she had been as God.\n\nThey were reconciled, of course, by tea-time. Alwynne, quieted by\nsolitude, was soon bewildered at her own ill-humour, shocked at the\nsentiments she had been able to entertain, remorseful at hurting\nElsbeth's feelings and spoiling her Christmas Day. They were able to\nsend each other to bed happy again.\n\nBut they had no more snap-dragons and early stockings. The next\nChristmas, shorn of its splendours, was a strange day to them both, but,\nat least, a peaceful one, with Alwynne at her gentlest, and Elsbeth,\nforgiving her as best she could, for her long skirts and her seventeen\nyears.\n\nWith the passing of yet another year, however, Alwynne's last scruple as\nto the sacrosanct privacy of Christmas celebrations vanished utterly.\nThe ideal day, she saw at last, and clearly, should be neither a\nchildren's carnival, nor a symposium of relatives. (Alwynne knew of none\nbut Elsbeth, but she dearly loved a phrase.) Christmas should be a time\nof social intercourse, of peace and goodwill towards men--the human\nrace--neighbours and friends--not merely relations.... One should not\nshut oneself up.... It would be a sound idea, for instance, to ask some\none to dinner.... A friend of Elsbeth's--or there was Clare! It would be\nvery jolly if Clare could come to dinner.... Clare was delightful when\nshe was in holiday mood; she could keep the table in a roar.... A little\nfun would do Elsbeth good.... Surely Elsbeth would enjoy having Clare to\ndinner?\n\nShe found herself, however, experiencing considerable difficulty in\nopening up the project to her aunt. Elsbeth, to whom the possibility of\nsuch a request had long ago presented itself, who could have told you by\nsheer intuition at what exact moment the idea occurred to her niece,\ngave her no help. Alwynne had contrived to put her in the position of\nappearing to approve Clare Hartill. Clare, she felt, had had something\nto do with that. She knew that it would be unwise to lose the advantage\nof her apparent tolerance; knew that Clare expected her to lose it by\nsome impulsive expression of mistrust or dislike, and intended to\nutilise the lapse for her own ends. It would be easy for Clare to pose\nas the generous victim of unreasoning hostility. But Clare should not,\nshe resolved, have the opportunity. She, Elsbeth, would never be so far\nlacking in cordiality as to give her any sort of handle. But Clare\nHartill should not eat her Christmas dinner with them, vowed Elsbeth,\nfor all that.\n\nSo for a couple of days, Alwynne, approaching Elsbeth from all possible\nangles, found no crack in her armour, and somewhat puzzled, but entirely\nunsuspicious, thought it hard that Elsbeth should be, at times, so\ncuriously unresponsive. She would not have scrupled to ask her aunt\noutright to invite Clare, but she quite genuinely wished to find out\nfirst if Elsbeth would mind, and never guessed that the difficulty she\nfound in opening the matter was the answer to that question.\n\nThe arrival of the turkey was her opportunity.\n\nSailing into the kitchen in search of raisins (the more maturely\ndignified Alwynne's deportment, the more likely her detection in some\nabsurd child's habit or predilection), she found Elsbeth raging\nlow-voiced, and the small maid gaping admiration over the brobdingnagian\nproportions of their Christmas dinner.\n\n\"Look at it, Alwynne! What am I to do? Twenty pounds! And we shan't get\nthrough ten! Really, it's too bad--I wrote so distinctly. It's\nimpossible to return it--to Devonshire! No time. It's the twenty-second\nalready. How shall we ever get through it?\"\n\n\"We might get some one in to help us,\" began Alwynne delightedly. But\nElsbeth, very busy all of a sudden, with basin and egg-beater, whisked\nand bustled her out of the kitchen.\n\nAlwynne returned to the matter, however, later in the day.\n\n\"Elsbeth, we shall never manage that turkey alone.\"\n\n\"Of course, I must send some over to Mrs. Marpler,\" began Elsbeth\nhastily.\n\nMrs. Marpler was a charwoman. Alwynne contrived to make their succession\nof little maids adore her, but she and Mrs. Marpler detested one another\ncordially. Mrs. Marpler's offences, according to Alwynne, were that she\nwas torpid, inefficient, breathed heavily, smelled of cats, and, by the\ncomplicated and judicious recital of the authentic calamities which\nregularly befell her, lured from Elsbeth more than her share of the\nbroken meats and old clothes of the establishment, perquisites which\nAlwynne, entirely incredulous, coveted for pet dependents of her own.\nAlwynne's offences, according to Mrs. Marpler, were, the aforementioned\nincredulity, her hostile influence on Miss Loveday, a certain crispness\nof manner and a tendency to open all windows in Mrs. Marpler's\nneighbourhood. The feud distressed Elsbeth, and Alwynne's diagnosis of\nMrs. Marpler's character; for she liked to believe the best of every\none. Alwynne forced her to agree, but secretly she sympathised with her\nfeckless char-lady.\n\n\"Marpler has been out of work three weeks, and as poor Mrs. Marpler\nsays, where their Christmas dinner is to come from----\"\n\n\"How much extra did you pay her this week?\" demanded Alwynne\nremorselessly. \"And last week--and the week before--and the week before\nthat? Of course he's out of work. Who wouldn't be?\"\n\n\"My dear Alwynne, if you think they can buy a Christmas dinner on what I\ngave them--\" retorted Elsbeth heatedly. \"But it's absurd to argue with\nyou. What do you know of what food costs?\"\n\n\"Anyhow, Mrs. Baker, with six children----\" began Alwynne, who also had\nbeen primed by a prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e. But she recollected that she did not wish to\nannoy Elsbeth at this juncture. Clare must take precedence of Mrs.\nBaker. \"Well, you can send them the legs and the carcase,\" she conceded;\n\"even then there will be more than we can possibly manage. Couldn't we\nask some one to spend the day with us?\"\n\n\"I hardly think,\" said Elsbeth, with a touch of severity, \"that you\nwould find any one. Most people like to keep Christmas with their\nRelations.\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't got any. But by all accounts I think I should hate 'em\nin the plural as much as I love 'em in the singular.\" She blew Elsbeth a\nkiss. \"But if we could find some one--to help us eat up the turkey--and\nspend the evening--it would be rather jolly, don't you think? It was\ndullish last year, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Was it?\" said Elsbeth, with careful brightness. \"I'm sorry. I had\nthought you enjoyed it.\"\n\n\"Oh, why is she so touchy? I didn't mean anything,\" cried Alwynne within\nherself. And aloud--\n\n\"Oh, I only meant without a tree or anything specially Christmassy----\"\n\n\"Alwynne,\" said Elsbeth, with scrupulous patience, \"it was you who\nsuggested not having one.\"\n\n\"I know, I know, I know, I know!\" cried Alwynne, in a fever.\n\nElsbeth sighed.\n\nAlwynne repented.\n\n\"Elsbeth darling, I didn't mean to be rude; I'm a beast. And I didn't\nmean it wasn't nice last year. I only meant--it would be--be a change to\nhave some one--because of the turkey--and I thought, perhaps Clare----\"\n\n\"Can't you exist for a day without seeing Clare Hartill?\" asked Elsbeth,\nwith a wry smile.\n\nAlwynne dimpled.\n\n\"Not very well,\" she said.\n\nElsbeth stared at her plate. Alwynne edged her chair along the table,\ntill she sat at Elsbeth's elbow. She slid an arm round her neck.\n\n\"Elsbeth! Elsbeth, dear! You're not cross, Elsbeth? It's a very big\nturkey. Do, Elsbeth!\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Ask Clare. You like her, don't you?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Don't you, Elsbeth?\" Alwynne's tone was a little anxious.\n\n\"Would you care if I didn't?\" The pattern of her plate still interested\nElsbeth. She was tracing its windings with her fork.\n\n\"You silly--it would just spoil everything. That's just it--I would like\nto get you two fond of each other, only with Clare so busy there's never\na chance of your really getting acquainted.\"\n\n\"I knew Clare Hartill long before you did, Alwynne. I knew her as a\nschoolgirl.\"\n\n\"But not well--not as I know her.\"\n\n\"No, not as you know her.\"\n\n\"There you are,\" said Alwynne, with satisfaction. \"That's why--you don't\nknow her properly. Oh, Elsbeth, you must share all my good things, and\nClare's the very best of them. Do let her come.\"\n\n\"She may be engaged; she probably is.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--Clare will be alone--I know, because----\" she stopped herself.\n\nElsbeth questioned her with her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, nothing--only I happen to know,\" said Alwynne.\n\n\"Because?\"\n\nAlwynne shook her head mischievously.\n\n\"Oh, well, if you won't tell me----\" began Elsbeth.\n\n\"Oh, I will, I will,\" cried Alwynne hastily.\n\n\"My dear, I don't want to know Miss Hartill's secrets, or yours either,\"\nsaid Elsbeth huffily. But to herself, \"Why am I losing my temper over\nthese silly trifles?\"\n\n\"Elsbeth dear, it was nothing. Only Clare did ask me to spend Christmas\nDay with her.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Elsbeth jealously.\n\n\"What?\" asked Alwynne's ingenuous eyes.\n\n\"Are you going?\"\n\nAlwynne nestled up to her, humming with careful flatness the final bars\nof _Home, sweet home_.\n\n\"Elsbeth, you old darling--I do believe you're jealous! Are you,\nElsbeth? Are you?\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" repeated Elsbeth.\n\nAlwynne was sobered by her tone.\n\n\"I'm going to spend my Christmas Day in my own home, with my own\nElsbeth,\" she said, \"and I think you needn't have asked me.\"\n\nElsbeth melted.\n\n\"My dear, I'm a silly old woman----\"\n\n\"Yes, you tell me that once a week.\"\n\n\"One day you'll believe it.--All right--you can ask your Miss\nHartill--or shall I write?\"\n\nAlwynne hugged her.\n\n\"Elsbeth, you're an angel! I'll go round at once. Oh, it will be jolly.\"\n\n\"If she comes.\"\n\nAlwynne turned, on the way to her bedroom. Elsbeth's intonation was\npeculiar.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don't think she'll come, Alwynne.\"\n\n\"But I know she'll be alone----\"\n\n\"Well, you go and ask her.\"\n\n\"But why do you say that--in that tone?\"\n\n\"I may be wrong. But I've known her longer than you have. But run along\nand ask her.\"\n\n\"But why? Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't bother me, child,\" cried Elsbeth impatiently. \"Run along and\nask her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\n\"I had a letter from Louise yesterday,\" announced Clare.\n\nShe was curled up in a saddle-bag before the roaring golden fire, and\nwas busy with paper and pencil. Alwynne, big with her as yet unissued\ninvitation, sat cross-legged on the white bearskin at her feet. The\nfloor was littered with papers and book-catalogues. At Christmas-time\nClare ordered books as a housewife orders groceries, and she and Alwynne\nhad spent a luxurious evening over her lists. The vivid flames lit up\nClare's thin, lazy length, and turned the hand she held up against their\nheat into transparent carnelian. Her face was in shadow, but there were\ndancing specks of light in her sombre eyes that kept time with the\nleaping blaze. Clare was a sybarite over her fires. She would not endure\ncoal or gas or stove--wood, and wood only, must be used; and she would\npay any price for apple-wood, ostensibly for the quality of its flame,\nsecretly for the mere pleasure of burning fuel with so pleasant a name;\nfor she liked beautiful words as a child likes chocolate--a sober,\nacquisitive liking. She had, too, though she would not own it, a delight\nin destruction, costly destruction; she enjoyed the sensation of\nreckless power that it gave her. The trait might be morbid, but there\nwas not a trace of pose in it; she could have enjoyed a Whittington\nbonfire, without needing a king to gasp applause. Yet she shivered\nnightly as she undressed in her cold bedroom, rather than commit the\nextravagance of an extra fire. She never realised the comicality of her\ncontradictoriness, or even its existence in her character, though it\nqualified every act and impulse of her daily life. Her soul was, indeed,\na hybrid, combining the temper of a Calvinist with the tastes of a\nRenascence bishop.\n\nAt the moment she was in gala mood. The autumn term was but four days\ndead, she had not had time to tire of holidays, though, within a week,\nshe would be bored again, and restless for the heavy work under which\nshe affected to groan. Her chafing mind seldom allowed her indolent body\nmuch of the peace it delighted in--was ever the American in lotus-land.\nIt was fidgeted at the moment by Alwynne's absorption in a lavishly\nillustrated catalogue.\n\n\"Did you hear, Alwynne? A letter from Louise.\"\n\nAlwynne's \"Oh?\" was absent. It was in the years of the Rackham craze,\nand she had just discovered a reproduction of the _Midsummer_ Helen.\n\n\"Any message?\" Clare knew how to prod Alwynne.\n\nThe girl glanced up amused but a little indignant.\n\n\"You've answered it already? Well! And the weeks I've had to wait\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"This was such a charming letter,\" said Clare smoothly. \"It deserved an\nanswer. She really has the quaintest style. And Alwynne--never a blot or\na flourish! It's a pleasure to read.\"\n\nAlwynne laughed ruefully. She would always squirm good-humouredly under\nClare's pin-pricks, with such amusement at her own discomfiture that\nClare never knew whether to fling away her needle for good, or, for the\nmere experiment's sake, to stab hard and savagely. At that stage of\ntheir intimacy, Alwynne's guilelessness invariably charmed and disarmed\nher--she knew that it would take a very crude display of cruelty to make\nAlwynne believe that she was being hurt intentionally. Clare was amused\nby the novel pedestal upon which she had been placed; she was accustomed\nto the panoply of Minerva, or the bow of Diana Huntress, but she had\nnever before been hailed as Bona Dea. It tickled her to be endowed with\nevery domestic virtue, to be loved, as Alwynne loved her, with the\nsecure and fearless affection of a daughter for a newly-discovered and\nadorable young mother. She appreciated Alwynne's determination of their\nrelationship, her nice sense of the difference in age, her modesty in\nreserving any claim to an equality in their friendship, her frank and\naffectionate admiration--yet, while it pleased her, it could pique. Calm\ncomradeship or surrendering adoration she could cope with, but the\nsubtle admixture of such alien states of mind was puzzling. She had\nacquired a lover with a sense of humour and she felt that she had her\nhands full. Her imperious will would, in time, she knew, eliminate\neither the lover or the humour--it annoyed her that she was not as yet\nquite convinced that it would be the humour. She intended to master\nAlwynne, but she realised that it would be a question of time, that she\nwould give her more trouble than the children to whom she was\naccustomed. Alwynne's utter unrealisation of the fact that a trial of\nstrength was in progress, was disconcerting: yet Clare, jaded and\nsuper-subtle, found her innocence endearing. Without relaxing in her\npurpose, she yet caught herself wondering if an ally were not better\nthan a slave. But the desire for domination was never entirely shaken\noff, and Alwynne's free bearing was in itself an ever-present challenge.\nClare loved her for it, but her pride was in arms. It was her misfortune\nnot to realise that, for all her Olympian poses, she had come to love\nAlwynne deeply and enduringly.\n\nAlwynne, meanwhile, laughing and pouting on the hearth, the firelight\nrevealing every change of expression in her piquant face, was declining\nto be classed with Agatha Middleton; her handwriting may be bad, but it\nwasn't a beetle-track; anyhow, Queen Elizabeth had a vile fist--Clare\nadmired Queen Elizabeth, didn't she? She had always so much to say to\nClare, that if she stopped to bother about handwriting----! Had Clare\nnever got into a row for untidiness in her own young days? Elsbeth had\nhinted.... But of course she reserved judgment till she had heard\nClare's version! She settled to attention and Clare, inveigled into\nreminiscences, found herself recounting quaint and forgotten incidents\nto her own credit and discredit, till, before the evening was over,\nAlwynne knew almost as much of Clare's schooldays as Clare did herself.\nShe could never resist telling Alwynne stories, Alwynne was always so\ngenuinely breathless with interest.\n\nThey returned to Louise at last, and Alwynne read the letter, chuckling\nover the odd phrases, and dainty marginal drawings. She would have\ndearly liked to see Clare's answer. She was glad, for all her protests,\nthat Clare had been moved to answer; she knew so well the delight it\nwould give Louise. The child would need cheering up. For, quite\nresignedly and by the way, Louise had mentioned that the Denny family\nhad developed whooping-cough, and emigrated to Torquay, and she, in\nquarantine, though it was hoped she had escaped infection, was preparing\nfor a solitary Christmas.\n\nAlwynne looked up at Clare with wrinkled brows.\n\n\"Poor child! But what can I do? I haven't had whooping-cough, and\nElsbeth is always so afraid of infection; or else she could have come to\nus. I know Elsbeth wouldn't have minded.\"\n\n\"You are going to leave me to myself then? You've quite made up your\nmind?\"\n\nAlwynne's eyes lighted up.\n\n\"Oh, Clare, it's all right. You are coming! At least--I mean--Elsbeth\nsends her kindest regards, and she would be so pleased if you will come\nto dinner with us on Christmas Day,\" she finished politely.\n\nClare laughed.\n\n\"It's very kind of your aunt.\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't it?\" said Alwynne, with ingenuous enthusiasm.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't come, Alwynne.\"\n\nAlwynne's face lengthened.\n\n\"Oh, Clare! Why ever not?\"\n\nClare hesitated. She had no valid reason, save that she preferred the\ncomfort of her own fireside and that she had intended Alwynne to come to\nher. Alwynne's regretful refusal when she first mooted the arrangement,\nshe had not considered final, but this invitation upset her plans.\nElsbeth's influence was opposing her. She hated opposition. Also she did\nnot care for Elsbeth. It would not be amiss to make Elsbeth (not her\ndislike of Elsbeth) the reason for her refusal. It would have its effect\non Alwynne sooner or later.\n\nShe considered Alwynne narrowly, as she answered--\n\n\"My dear, I had arranged to be at home, for one thing.\"\n\nAlwynne looked hurt.\n\n\"Of course, if you don't care about it--\" she began.\n\nClare rallied her.\n\n\"Be sensible, my child. It is most kind of Miss Loveday; but--wasn't it\nchiefly your doing, Alwynne? Imagine her dismay if I accepted. A\nstranger in the gate! On Christmas Day! One must make allowances for\nlittle prejudices, you know.\"\n\n\"She'll be awfully disappointed,\" cried Alwynne, so eager for Clare that\nshe believed it.\n\n\"Will she?\" Clare laughed pleasantly. \"Every one doesn't wear your\nspectacles. What would she do with me, for a whole day?\"\n\n\"We shouldn't see her much,\" began Alwynne. \"She spends most of her time\nin church. I go in the morning--(yes, I'm very good!) but I've drawn the\nline at turning out after lunch.\"\n\n\"Then why shouldn't you come to me instead? It would be so much better.\nI shall be alone, you know.\" Clare's wistful intonation was not entirely\nartificial.\n\nAlwynne was distressed.\n\n\"Oh, Clare, I'd love to--you know I'd love to--but how could I? Elsbeth\nwould be dreadfully hurt. I couldn't leave her alone on Christmas Day.\"\n\n\"But you can me?\"\n\n\"Clare, don't put it like that. You know I shall want to be with you all\nthe time. But Elsbeth's like my mother. It would be beastly of me. You\nmust put relations first at Christmas-time, even if they're not first\nreally.\"\n\nShe smiled at Clare, but she felt disloyal as she said it, and hated\nherself. Yet wasn't it true? Clare came first, though Elsbeth must never\nguess it. Dear old Elsbeth was pretty dense, thank goodness! Where\nignorance is bliss, etcetera! Yet she, Alwynne, felt extraordinarily\nmean....\n\nClare watched her jealously. She had set her heart on securing Alwynne\nfor Christmas Day, and had thought, ten minutes since, with a secret,\nconfident smile, that there would not be much difficulty. And here was\nAlwynne holding out--refusing categorically! It was incredible! Yet she\ncould not be angry: Alwynne so obviously was longing to be with her....\nEqually obviously prepared to risk her displeasure (a heavy penalty\nalready, Clare guessed, to Alwynne), rather than ignore the older claim.\nClare thought that an affection that could be so loyal to a tedious old\nmaid was better worth deflecting than many a more ardent, unscrupulous\nenthusiasm. Alwynne was showing strength of character.\n\nShe persisted nevertheless--\n\n\"Well, it's a pity. I must eat my Christmas dinner alone, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, Clare, you might come to us,\" cried Alwynne. \"I can't see why you\nwon't.\"\n\nClare shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"If you can't see why, my dear Alwynne, there's no more to be said.\"\n\nAlwynne most certainly did not see; but Clare's delicately reproachful\ntone convicted her, and incidentally Elsbeth, of some failure in tact.\nShe supposed she had blundered ... she often did.... But Elsbeth, at\nleast, must be exonerated ... she did so want Clare to think well of\nElsbeth....\n\nShe perjured herself in hasty propitiation.\n\n\"Yes. Yes--I do see. I ought to have known, of course. Elsbeth was quite\nright. She said you wouldn't, all along.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Clare sat up. \"Oh? Your aunt said that, did she?\" She spoke with\ndetachment, but inwardly she was alert, on guard. Elsbeth had suddenly\nbecome worth attention.\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" Alwynne's voice was rueful. \"She was quite sure of it. She\nsaid I might ask you, with pleasure, if I didn't believe her--you see,\nshe'd love you to come--but she didn't think you would.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Clare, laughing naturally, \"what made her say that?\"\n\n\"She said she knew you better than I did,\" confided Alwynne, with one of\nher spurts of indignation. \"As if----\"\n\n\"Yes, it's rather unlikely, isn't it?\" said Clare, with an intimate\nsmile. \"But you're not going?\"\n\n\"I must. Look at the time! Elsbeth will be having fits!\" Alwynne called\nfrom the hall where she was hastily slipping on her coat and hat.\n\nClare stood a moment--thinking.\n\nSo the duel had been with Elsbeth! So that negligible and mouse-like\nwoman had been aware--all along ... had prepared, with a thoroughness\nworthy of Clare herself, for the inevitable encounter ... had worsted\nClare completely.... It was amazing.... Clare was compelled to\nadmiration. It was clear to her now that Elsbeth must have distrusted\nher from the beginning. It had been Elsbeth's doing, not hers, that\ntheir intercourse had been so slight.... Yet she had never restrained\nAlwynne; she had risked giving her her head.... She was subtle! This\naffair of the Christmas dinner for instance--Clare appreciated its\ncleverness. Elsbeth had not wanted her, Clare now saw clearly; had been\nanxious to avoid the intimacy that such an invitation would imply;\nequally anxious, surely, that Alwynne should not guess her uneasy\njealousy: so she had risked the invitation, counting on her knowledge of\nClare's character (Clare stamped with vexation--that the woman should\nhave such a memory!) secure that Clare, unsuspicious of her motives,\nwould, by refusing, do exactly as Elsbeth wished. It had been the\nneatest of gossamer traps--and Clare had walked straight into it....\nShe was furious. If Alwynne, maddeningly unsuspicious Alwynne, had but\nenlightened her earlier in the evening! Now she was caught, committed by\nher own decision of manner to the course of action she most would have\nwished to avoid.... She could not change her mind now without appearing\nfoolishly vacillating.... It would not do.... She had been bluffed,\nsuccessfully, gorgeously bluffed.... And Elsbeth was sitting at home\nenjoying the situation ... too sure of herself and Clare even to be\ncurious as to the outcome of it all. She knew. Clare stamped again. Oh,\nbut she would pay Elsbeth for this.... The _casus belli_ was infinitely\ntrivial, but the campaign should be Homeric.... And this preliminary\nengagement could not affect the final issues.... She always won in the\nend.... But, after all, Elsbeth could not be blamed, though she must be\ncrushed; Alwynne was worth fighting for! Elsbeth was a fool.... If she\nhad treated Clare decently, Clare might--possibly--have shared Alwynne\nwith her.... She believed she would have had scruples.... Now they were\ndispelled.... Alwynne, by fair means or foul, should be detached ...\nshould become Clare's property ... should be given up to no living woman\nor man.\n\nShe followed Alwynne into the hall and lit the staircase candle. She\nwould see Alwynne out. She would have liked to keep Alwynne with her for\na month. She was a delightful companion; it was extraordinary how\nindispensable she made herself. Clare knew that her flat would strike\nher as a dreary place to return to, when she had shut the door on\nAlwynne. She would sit and read and feel restless and lonely. Yet she\ndid not allow herself to feel lonely as a rule; she scouted the\nweakness. But Alwynne wound herself about you, thought Clare, and you\nnever knew, till she had gone, what a difference she made to you.\n\nShe wished she could keep Alwynne another couple of hours.... But it was\neleven already ... her hold was not yet strong enough to warrant\ninnovations to which Elsbeth could object.... Her time would come\nlater.... How much later would depend on whether it were affection that\nswayed Alwynne, or only a sense of duty.... She believed, because she\nhoped, that it was duty--a sense of duty was more easily suborned than\nan affection.... For the present, however, Alwynne must be allowed to do\nas she thought right. Clare knew when she was beaten, and, with her\ncapacity for wry admiration of virtues that she had not the faintest\nintention of incorporating in her own character, she was able to applaud\nAlwynne heartily. Yet she did not intend to make victory easy to her.\n\nThey went down the flights of stairs silently, side by side. Alwynne\nopened the entrance doors and stood a moment, fascinated.\n\n\"Look, Clare! What a night!\"\n\nThe moon was full and flooded earth and sky with bright, cold light. The\ngarden, roadway, roofs, trees and fences glittered like powdered\ndiamonds, white with frost and moonshine. The silence was exquisite.\n\nThey stood awhile, enjoying it.\n\nSuddenly Clare shivered. Alwynne became instantly and anxiously\npractical.\n\n\"Clare, what am I thinking of? Go in at once--you'll catch a dreadful\ncold.\"\n\nWith unusual passivity Clare allowed herself to be hurried in. At the\nstaircase Alwynne said good-bye, handing her her candle, and waiting\ntill she should have passed out of sight. On the fourth step Clare\nhesitated, and turned--\n\n\"Alwynne--come to me for Christmas?\"\n\nAlwynne flung out her hands.\n\n\"Clare! I mustn't.\"\n\n\"Alwynne--come to me for Christmas?\"\n\n\"You know I mustn't! You know you'd think me a pig if I did, now\nwouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I expect so.\"\n\n\"But I'll come in for a peep at you,\" cried Alwynne, brightening,\n\"while Elsbeth's at afternoon service. I could do that. And to say Merry\nChristmas!\"\n\n\"Come to dinner?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"Then you needn't come at all.\" Clare turned away.\n\nAlwynne caught her hand, as it leaned on the balustrade. In the other\nthe candle shook a little.\n\n\"Lady Macbeth! Dear Lady Macbeth! Miss Hartill of the Upper Sixth, whom\nI'm scared to death of, really--you're behaving like a very naughty\nsmall child. Now, aren't you? Honestly? Oh, do turn round and crush me\nwith a look for being impudent, and then tell me that I'm only doing\nwhat you really approve. I don't want to, Clare, but you know you hate\nselfishness.\"\n\nClare looked down at her.\n\n\"All right, Alwynne. You must do as you like.\"\n\n\"Say good-night to me,\" demanded Alwynne. \"Nicely, Clare, very nicely!\nIt's Christmas-time.\"\n\nCarefully Clare deposited her candlestick on the stair above. Leaning\nover the banisters, she put her arms round Alwynne and kissed her\npassionately and repeatedly.\n\n\"Good-night, my darling,\" said Clare.\n\nThen, recoiling, she caught up her candlestick, and without another word\nor look, hurried up the stairs.\n\nAlwynne walked home on air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nElsbeth bore the news of Clare's defection with stoicism; but her\nmotherly soul was disturbed by Alwynne's disappointment, though she\ncould not stifle her pleasure in its cause. She felt, indeed, somewhat\nguilty, and was eager to atone by acquiescing in Alwynne's plan of\nvisiting Clare while she went to church; and met her more than half way\nover the question of an altered tea-hour.\n\nAlwynne, who from the first had been fretted, though but half\nconsciously, by the faintly repellent manner assumed by each of the two\nwomen at mention of the other, was soothed by Elsbeth's advances.\nElsbeth was a dear, after all: there was no one quite like Elsbeth....\nFor all her obstinacies and unreasonableness, she never really failed\nyou.... She could be depended on to love you at your worst; you could\nquarrel with her with never a fear of real alienation.... Elsbeth might\nnot be exciting, but she was as indispensable as food.... She was, after\nall, the starting-point and ultimate goal of all one's adventures....\nClare would lose some of her delightfulness, if there were no Elsbeth to\nwhom to en-sky on her.... Alwynne did not see what she wanted with a\nmother, so long as she had Elsbeth.... She had said so once to her aunt\nand had never guessed, as she was chidden for sacrilege against the\npicture over her bed, at the exquisite pleasure she had given.\n\nAfter the little coolness of the past few days (her aunt's fault\nentirely, Alwynne knew, and so could be unruffled) Elsbeth's renewal of\nsympathetic interest was very soothing. Alwynne was glad to foster it by\ntalking of Clare, and Clare, and nothing but Clare, for the rest of the\nweek. In church on Christmas morning, poor Elsbeth, settling her\nspiritual accounts, begging forgiveness for uncharitable thoughts, and\nassuring her Maker that she wished Clare no evil, could yet sigh for the\nuseful age of miracles, and patron saints, and devils, when a prayer in\nthe right quarter could transport your enemy to inaccessible islands of\nthe Antipodes. She would have been magnanimous, have bargained for every\ncomfort--Eden's climate and hot and cold water laid on--but the island\nmust be definitely inaccessible and Antipodean.\n\nClare, too, had spent her morning, if not in prayer, at least in\nprofound meditation. She felt stranded, and was wishing for Alwynne, and\nanathematising the superfluous and intriguing aunt.\n\nClare made the mistake of all tortuous intelligences in being unable to\ncredit appearances. She was being, as usual, unjust to Elsbeth, Alwynne,\nand the world at large. She could not believe in simplicity combined\nwith brains: a simple soul was necessarily a simpleton in her eyes.\nBecause her own words were ever two edged, her meaning flavoured by\nreservations and implications, she literally could not accept a speech\nas expressing no more and no less than its plain dictionary meaning.\nWith any one of her own type of mind she was at her ease; her mistake\nlay in not recognising how rare that type was; in detecting subtleties\nwhere none existed, and wasting hint, suggestion and innuendo on minds\nthat drove as heartily through them as an ox walks through a spider\nthread stretched from post to gatepost of the meadow he means to enter.\n\nElsbeth, whom she had considered a negligible fool, had yesterday\nstartled her into respect--not for the kindly and selfless pleasure in\nAlwynne's pleasure, that had, for all her little jealous anxieties,\nprompted the invitation to Clare, but for the totally imaginary cunning\nwith which, in Clare's eyes, it had invested her. Alwynne's repetition\nof Elsbeth's remark had enlightened Clare: enlightened her to qualities\nin Elsbeth which Elsbeth herself would have been horrified to possess.\n\nClare saw, in the manner of the invitation, a gauntlet flung down, the\npreliminaries to a conflict, with Alwynne herself for the prize; and the\nfirst warning of an antagonist sufficiently like herself to be\nconsidered dangerous, the more dangerous, indeed, for the apparently\nuninteresting harmlessness that could mask a mind in reality so scheming\nand so complex. She did not realise that if she did finally close with\nElsbeth, with the intention of robbing her of Alwynne, she would have\nfar more to fear from her simple, affectionate goodness of heart than\nfrom any subtlety of intellect with which Clare was choosing to invest\nher.\n\nShe wondered, as she frittered away the morning, how she should best\ncounter Elsbeth's attack. She would call, of course--in state; it would\nbe due; she would not be judged deficient in courtesies. Alwynne should\nbe there (she would ensure that), and she, Clare, would be exceedingly\ncharming, and very delicately emphasise the contrast between Elsbeth and\nherself. It would be quite easy, with Alwynne already biassed. Her eyes\nsparkled with anticipation. It would be amusing. She should enjoy\nrouting Elsbeth.\n\nAnd there was the case of Alwynne to be considered. She had been\nexcessively nice to Alwynne lately, had, in fact, allowed her, for a\nmoment, to see how necessary she was becoming to Clare.... That was a\nmistake.... One must never let people feel secure of their hold upon\none.... That little speech of Alwynne's last night, mocking and\ntender--she had thrilled to it at the time--did it not, ever so faintly,\nshadow forth a readjustment of attitudes, sound a note of equality?\nThat, though it had pleased her at the moment, must not be.... Alwynne\nmust be checked.... It would not hurt her.... She was subdued as easily\nas a child, and as easily revived.... She never bore malice. Clare, who\nnever forgot or forgave a pinprick, had often marvelled at her, could\neven now scarcely believe in the spontaneity of her good temper. But\nAlwynne, certainly, had been going too far lately; was absurdly popular\nin the school; could, Clare guessed, have annexed more than one of her\nown special worshippers, if she had chosen. Louise, she knew, confided\nin her: she thought with a double stab of jealousy of the scene she had\nwitnessed but a few days since; of Louise, fresh from her commendations,\nfrom her kiss even (that rare impulse, regretted as soon as gratified),\nat rest in Alwynne's arms. She recalled Louise's startled look and\nAlwynne's contrasting serenity. She had not enquired what it all\nmeant--that was not her way. But she had not forgotten it. Alwynne was\nhers. Louise was hers. But they had nothing to seek from one another!\nAlwynne, undoubtedly, as the elder, the dearer, required the check; not\nlittle Louise. Louise's letter had genuinely touched her--she thought\nshe would go and see the child, spend her Christmas Day charitably, in\namusing her. And if (in after-thought) Alwynne came round in the\nafternoon, and found her gone--it couldn't be helped! It wouldn't hurt\nAlwynne to be disappointed.... It wouldn't hurt Alwynne to spend a day\nof undiluted Elsbeth.... And Louise would be amusingly charmed to see\nClare.... It was pleasant to please a child--a clever, appreciative\nchild.... She would go round directly after lunch.... The maid should go\nhome for the afternoon.... She laughed mischievously as she imagined the\nblankness of Alwynne's face, when she should be confronted by silence\nand a closed door. Poor, dear Alwynne! Well, it wouldn't hurt her.\n\nBut Alwynne set out gaily on Christmas afternoon, and, first escorting\nElsbeth to the lych-gate of her favourite church, walked on as quickly\nas her narrow fur-edged skirt would let her.\n\nThe clocks were striking three as she turned into Friar's Lane.\n\nIt was a cold, still day, and Alwynne shivered a little, and drew her\nfurs closely about her, as she stood outside the door of Clare's flat.\nShe had rung, but the maid was usually slow in answering.\n\nThe passage was damply cold. It would be all the jollier to toast\noneself before one of Clare's imperial fires.... She wished the maid\nwould hurry up. She waited a moment and then rang again.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nIt struck her that the maid might have been given the afternoon off; but\nit was funny that Clare did not hear.\n\nShe rang again. She could hear the bell tinging shrilly within, but\nthere was no other sound save the tick of the solemn little grandmother\non the inner side of the wall.\n\nSuddenly it occurred to her that Clare might be dozing. Clare never\nslept in the afternoons, but she did occasionally doze in her chair for\na few minutes. She denied that she did so as strenuously as people\nalways and unaccountably do; but Alwynne knew better. It always\ndelighted her when Clare succumbed to drowsiness; a good sleeper\nherself, she had been appalled by Clare's acquiescence in four wakeful\nnights out of seven, and after a casual description that Clare had once\ngiven her of the arid miseries of insomnia, ten minutes' unexpected\nslumber did not give Clare herself more ease than it gave Alwynne.\n\nThe possibility of such an explanation of the silence, therefore, had to\nbe considered respectfully: if Clare slept, far be it from Alwynne to\nwake her! Yet she could not go away.... Clare, after that unlucky clash\nof wills, would be doubly hurt if Alwynne left without seeing her\nfirst.... But if Clare were asleep....\n\nResignedly Alwynne sat herself down on Clare's doorstep to wait until a\nmovement within should be the signal to ring again.\n\nShe was not annoyed; she always had plenty to think about; and it would\nbe very pleasant, when Clare did at last open the door, to be received\nwith open arms, and pitied, and scolded, and warmed.... It was certainly\nvery cold.... All the draughts of the town seemed to have their home on\nthe staircase, and to come sliding and slithering and undulating past,\nlike a brood of invisible snakes.\n\nShe shifted her position. The doorstep was icy. She got up, and placed\nher muff, her chinchilla muff (shades of Elsbeth! her beautiful, new\nchinchilla muff) on the whitened doorstep. Then she sat on it.\n\n\"Ah! That's better,\" murmured Alwynne appreciatively. She was grateful\nto Elsbeth for reminding her to wear her muff.\n\nBut it did not get any warmer, and the daylight was beginning to fade.\nShe glanced at her watch--twenty minutes past three. Surely Clare was\nawake again now. But she would wait another five minutes. She watched\nthe hands--marvelled at the interminable length of a minute, and was\ndrifting off on her favourite speculation as to the essential unreality\nof time, when simultaneously the grandmother struck the half-hour and\nshe sneezed. She jumped up horrified. A cold would mean a week's absence\nfrom Clare, and a restatement of Elsbeth's thesis \"of the advisability\nof wearing flannel petticoats and long-sleeved bodices.\"\n\nAlso, half of her hoarded hour was gone. She rang again impatiently. No\nanswer. Clare must be out.... Gone to the post? No, Alwynne had been\nwaiting half-an-hour, she would have returned by now.... Impossible that\nClare should be out on Christmas afternoon, when she had refused an\ninvitation and was expecting Alwynne herself.... She rang; and waited;\nand rang again and again and yet again.\n\n\"If Clare has gone out----\" cried Alwynne indignantly; and subjected the\nhandle to a final series of vicious tugs. The bell within pealed and\nrocked and jarred, gave a last hysterical gurgle and was dumb. She had\nbroken the bell. She had broken Clare Hartill's bell!\n\nAlwynne looked round about her guiltily; she felt more like nine than\nnineteen. The flight of stairs was still empty and silent. No one had\nseen her come; no one would see her go.... If she went quietly away, and\nsaid nothing about it? For Clare would be annoyed.... She always got so\nannoyed over little things.... What a pity to have a fuss with Clare\nover such a little thing as a broken bell!\n\nShe crept on tip-toe down the stairs and out into the road. Then she\npaused.\n\nWas she being mean? After all--there was no earthly use in telling\nClare.... Clare would never let her pay for the mending.... Yet\nnaturally she would be annoyed to come back and find her bell broken....\nShe would think it was the milkman or the paper-boy.... Alwynne hoped\nthey would not get into trouble.... Perhaps, after all, she had better\ntell Clare. Such an absurd thing to confess to, though--that she had\nbeen in such a temper that she had broken the bell! Clare would be\nsarcastic.... Yet it was Clare's fault for being out.... That was\nunkind.... She would tell Clare so ... she would write and tell her....\nShe would write a note now, and tell her about the bell at the same\ntime.... She retraced her steps, pulled out her note-book and pencil,\nand began to scribble--\n\n     _Dear Clare--I'm awfully sorry but I'm afraid I've broken the bell.\n     I couldn't make you hear. I thought you were asleep, but I suppose\n     you are out. I must have rung too hard, but I didn't think you\n     would be out._ Heavily underlined. _I'm dreadfully sorry about the\n     bell._\n\nShe hesitated. If Clare would let her pay for a new one, she wouldn't\nfeel so bad.... Yet how could she suggest it? It would sound so\ncrude.... If only Clare would not be angry.... Absurd to be feeling\nafraid of Clare--but then she had never done anything so stupid\nbefore.... Angry or not, Clare would never let her pay.... Yet should\nshe suggest it? She bit her pencil in distracted indecision, till the\nlead broke off between her teeth.\n\nThat settled it. The damp stump was barely capable of scoring an\n_Alwynne_.\n\nShe pinned the paper to the door with her only hatpin (a present of the\nforenoon) and reluctantly departed.\n\nIt was a pity that her best hat blew off twice into the mud.\n\nElsbeth was glad to get Alwynne back so early. Had Alwynne enjoyed\nherself?\n\nAlwynne sneezed as she answered.\n\nBefore the evening was over Alwynne reeked of eucalyptus.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nLouise was at the nursery window, staring out into the brown, bare\ngarden. The sky was smooth and a dark yellow, the naked trees barred it\nlike a tiger's hide. The gathering dusk had swallowed up the wind. Not a\ntwig stirred, not a sparrow's chirp broke the thick stillness.\nSpellbound, the world awaited the imminent snow.\n\nLouise, sitting motionless in the window-seat, with her little pink nose\nflattening itself against the panes in dreary expectation of a stray\nunlikely postman, looked, with her peaked, ivory face and dark,\nunwinking eyes, her colourless clothes, and the sprig of holly with\nnever a scarlet berry pinned to her flat little chest, like the mood of\nthe December day made flesh.\n\nClare, at least, thought so. Dispensing with the indifferent maid, she\nhad found her own way to the nursery, and pushing open the unlatched\ndoor, stood an instant, appraising the child and her surroundings. She\nnoted with distaste the remains of the barely tasted lunch, still\nencumbering the table, and impingeing on the little pile of austere\nChristmas presents, so carefully arranged: the gloves and stockings and\nthe prim Prayer Book a mere background for a dainty calendar that she\nrecognised. She smiled, with a touch of irritation--did Alwynne ever\nforget any one, she wondered? But it was not suitable for a mistress to\nsend her pupils presents.... She wished she had thought of sending\nLouise something herself ... something more original than that obviously\nover-prized calendar.... It was not much of a Christmas table, she\nthought ... not much of a Christmas Day for a child....\n\nShe marvelled that a well-furnished room could look so dreary. Louise's\nhuddled pose, the neglected fire, the book crushed face downwards on\nthe floor, combined to touch her. With her incurable feeling for the\neffective attitude, she remained straight and stiff in the shadows of\nthe doorway, but her gesture was beautiful in its awkward tenderness as\nshe stretched out her hand to the window.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, Louise!\"\n\nFor an instant the child was silent, rigid, incredulous: then came a\nwhirl of petticoats and a flash of black legs. Louise, wild with\nexcitement, dropped to the floor and dashed across the room.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Hartill! Oh, Miss Hartill! You?\"\n\n\"Well, are you pleased to see me?\"\n\n\"Please, won't you sit down?\" Louise, between delight and embarrassment,\ndid curious things with the big arm-chair. \"I can't believe it's you.\nAnd on Christmas Day! Won't you please sit down? Is the room too warm\nfor you? Will you take off your furs? Would you like some tea? I'll make\nup the fire--it's cold in here. Will you take this chair? Oh, Miss\nHartill! It's like the Queen calling on one. I don't know what to do.\"\nShe looked up at Clare, blushing. Her pleasure and excitement were\npretty enough.\n\nClare laughed.\n\n\"I'll tell you what to do. Run and put on your coat and hat. Would you\nlike to come and spend the rest of the day with me?\"\n\n\"With you?\" Louise's eyes opened. \"But it's Christmas Day?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I shan't be in the way?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Clare coolly. \"I'll send you home if you are.\"\n\nShe twinkled, but Louise was serious.\n\n\"You could do that, couldn't you?\" she remarked with relief. \"Oh, Miss\nHartill, you are good! And I was hating my Christmas Day so. Won't you\nsit down while I get my things on?\"\n\n\"Hurry up!\" said Clare. And Louise fled to her bedroom.\n\nTheir walk back to Friar's Lane was a silent one. The snow was at last\nbeginning to fall. Clare, half hypnotised by the steady silent motion,\ntramped forward, keeping time to some fragment of tune within her head.\nShe was warmed by the pleasant consciousness of a kindly action\nperformed, but its object, trotting beside her, was half forgotten.\n\nLouise, very shy at encountering Miss Hartill unofficially, was far too\ntimid to speak unless she were addressed. But she was perfectly happy;\nmarvelling and rejoicing at her situation (Miss Hartill's guest, bound\nfor her home!), overflowing with dog-like devotion to the Olympian who\nhad actually remembered her existence. She was glad of the silent walk.\nIt gave her time to realise her own happiness; to learn by heart that\npicture of Clare, against the background of the empty nursery, to get\nher every sentence by rote, and store all safely in her memory before\nturning to the contemplation of the incredible adventure upon which she\nwas now embarking.\n\nClare, preceding Louise up the staircase, found Alwynne's note awaiting\nher. She frowned as she read it and felt for her latch-key. It was just\nlike Alwynne to leave a note like that for any one to read.... And the\nhatpin for any one to steal.... She wished it had been stolen before it\nhad scratched her paint.... And the bell! It was really annoying of\nAlwynne! It would cost her five shillings to put right.... She, Clare,\nwas not mean, but she did begrudge money for that sort of thing....\nReally, Alwynne might offer to pay for it.... But that, of course, would\nnever occur to Alwynne.... She was altogether too reckless about other\npeople's belongings.... Her own were her own affair.... But to break\nClare's bell.... She must have been quite comprehensively annoyed to\nhave actually broken it.... Clare laughed. She had had a sudden vision\nof Alwynne's blank face and indignant pealings. Poor old Alwynne!\nWell--it wouldn't hurt her.... If she were careful to let Alwynne know\nto whom she had been sacrificed, Alwynne might not be quite so partisan\nover Louise next term.... That wouldn't be a bad thing.... She did not\napprove of intimacies between the girls and the mistresses.... But she,\nClare, would make it up to both of them.... She would begin now, with\nLouise.... She would devote herself to amusing Louise.... She would give\nLouise the time of her life.... Louise would be sure to tell Alwynne\nabout it afterwards....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n\"What are you going to do with yourself all the holidays?\" asked Clare,\nwith a touch of curiosity. Louise had slipped off her chair on to the\nsoft hearthrug, and sat, hugging her knees and staring up at Clare.\n\n\"Read,\" she said briefly, and gave a little gurgle of anticipation.\n\n\"All day long?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Miss Hartill. I never get a chance in term time. There's such\nheaps to read. I'd like to live in a library.\"\n\n\"Yet a peep at the world outside beats all the books that were ever\nwritten.\"\n\n\"I wonder.\" Louise rubbed her chin meditatively against her knees before\nshe delivered herself. \"You know--I think the way things strike people\nis much more interesting than the things themselves. I like exploring\npeople's minds. Do you know?\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Clare. She laughed mischievously. \"You mean--that what\nyou think I am, for instance, is much more interesting than what I\nreally am.\"\n\nLouise protested mutely. Her black eyes glowed.\n\n\"I daresay you're right, Louise. You wear pink spectacles, you see. I'm\nquite sure you would be appalled if any one took them off. I'm a horrid\nperson really.\"\n\nLouise looked puzzled; then the twinkle in Miss Hartill's eyes\nenlightened her. Miss Hartill was teasing. She laughed merrily.\n\nClare shook her head.\n\n\"It's quite true. I'm an egoist, Louise!\"\n\n\"It's not true,\" said Louise passionately. She was on guard in an\ninstant, ready to justify Miss Hartill to herself and the world.\n\nIt amused Clare to excite her.\n\n\"My good child--what do you know about it?\"\n\n\"Lots,\" said Louise, with a catch in her voice. \"You're not! You're\nnot!\"\n\n\"I am.\" Clare leaned forward, much tickled. She could afford to attempt\nto disillusion Louise.... Louise would not believe her, but she could\nnot say later that she had not been warned. But at the same time, Clare\nwarmed her cold and cynical self in the pure flame of affection her\nself-criticism was fanning. \"I am,\" she repeated. \"Why do you think I\ncame round to see you to-day?\"\n\nLouise looked up at her shyly, dwelling on her answer as if it gave her\nexquisite pleasure.\n\n\"Because--because you knew I was alone, and you hated me to be miserable\non Christmas Day.\"\n\n\"You?\" Clare's eyebrows lifted for a second, but a glance into the\nchild's candid eyes dispelled the vague suspicion.... Louise and conceit\nwere incompatible. She listened with a touch of compunction to the\ninnocent answer.\n\n\"Not me specially, of course. Any one who was down. Only it happened to\nbe me. I think you can't help being good to people: you're made that\nway.\" Her eyes were full of wondering admiration.\n\nClare was touched. She sighed as she answered--\n\n\"I wish I were. You shouldn't believe in people, Louise. I came round\nbecause--yes, you were a lonely scrap of a schoolgirl, certainly--but\nthere were lots of other reasons. I wanted a walk and I wanted to be\namused, and I wanted--and I wanted----\" she moved restlessly in her\nchair, \"All pure egoism, anyhow.\"\n\n\"But you came,\" said Louise.\n\n\"To please you, or to punish some one else? I don't know!\"\n\nLouise enjoyed her incomprehensibility. She stored up her remarks to\npuzzle over later. Yet she would ask questions if Miss Hartill were in a\ntalking mood.\n\n\"Do I know them?\" (She had an odd habit of using the plural when she\nwished to be discreet.) She wondered who had been punished, and why, and\nthrilled deliciously, as she did to a ghost story. She thought that it\nwould be terrible to have offended Miss Hartill: yet immensely\nexciting.... She wondered if all her courage would go if Miss Hartill\nwere angry? She had always despised poor Jeanne du Barrie: but Miss\nHartill raging would be harder to face than a mob....\n\n\"What have they done?\" asked Louise eagerly.\n\n\"They? It's your dear Miss Durand,\" said Clare, with a grim smile. \"I'm\nvery angry with her, Louise. She's been behaving badly.\"\n\nLouise's eyes widened: she looked alarmed and distressed.\n\n\"Oh, but Miss Hartill--she hasn't! She couldn't! What has she done?\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you?\" Clare leaned forward mysteriously.\n\nLouise nodded breathlessly.\n\n\"She wouldn't copy me and be an egoist. And I wanted her to, rather\nbadly, Louise. There, that's all! You're none the wiser, are you? Never\nmind, you will be, some day. Don't look so worried, you funny child.\"\n\n\"Why do you call yourself such names? You're not an egoist? You can't\nbe,\" cried Louise desperately.\n\nClare laughed.\n\n\"Can't I? Most people are. It's not a synonym for murderess! Stop\nfrowning, child. Why, I don't believe you know what it means even. Do\nyou know what an egoist is, Louise?\"\n\n\"Sir Willoughby Patterne!\" said Louise promptly.\n\nClare threw up her hands.\n\n\"What next? I wish I'd had charge of you earlier. You shouldn't try so\nhard to say 'Humph,' little pig.\"\n\n\"I don't.\" Louise was indignant.\n\n\"Then what possesses you to steer your cockle-boat on to Meredith?\nWell--what do you think of him? What have you read?\"\n\n\"About all. He's queer. He's not Dickens or Scott, of course----\" Her\ntone deprecated.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Clare, with grave sympathy.\n\n\"But I like him. I like Chloe. I like the sisters--you know--'Fine\nShades and Nice Feeling'----\"\n\n\"Why?\" Clare shot it at her.\n\n\"I don't know. They made me laugh. They're awfully real people. And I\nliked that book where the two gentlemen drink wine. 'Veuve' something.\"\n\n\"What on earth did you see in that?\" Clare was amused.\n\n\"I don't know. I just liked them. Of course, I adore Shagpat.\"\n\n\"That I understand. It's a fairy tale to you, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Not a proper one--only Arabian Nightsy.\"\n\n\"What's a proper one, Louise?\"\n\nLouise hesitated.\n\n\"Well, heaps that one loves aren't. Grimm's and Hans Andersen's aren't,\nor even _The Wondrous Isles_. And, of course, none of the Lang books. I\nhate those. You know, proper fairy stories aren't easy to get. You have\nto dig. You get bits out of the notes in the Waverley Novels, and\nthere's _Kilmeny_, and _The Celtic Twilight_, and _The Lore of\nProserpine_, and Lempri\u00c3\u00a8re. Do you believe in fairies, Miss Hartill?\"\n\n\"It depends on the mood I'm in,\" said Clare seriously, \"and the place.\nElves and electric railways are incompatible.\"\n\nLouise flung herself upon the axiom.\n\n\"Do you think so? Now I don't, Miss Hartill--I don't. If they are--they\ncan stand railways. But you just believe in them literaturily----\"\n\n\"Literally,\" Clare corrected.\n\n\"No, no--literaturily--just as a pretty piece of writing. You'll never\nsee them if you think of them like that, Miss Hartill. The Greeks\ndidn't--they just believed in Pan, and the Oreads, and the Dryads, and\nall those delicious people; and the consequence was that the country\nwas simply crammed with them. You just read Lempri\u00c3\u00a8re! I wish I'd lived\nthen. Miss Hartill, did you ever see a Good Person?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Louise. But I had a nurse who used to tell me about her\ngrand-aunt: she was supposed to be a changeling.\"\n\nLouise wriggled with delight.\n\n\"Oh, tell about her, Miss Hartill. What was she like?\"\n\n\"Tiny and black, with a very white skin. They were a fair family. Nurse\nsaid they all disliked her, though she never did them any harm. She used\nto be out in the woods all day--and she ate strange food.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Fungi, and nettle-tops, and young bracken, and blackberries, my nurse\nsaid.\"\n\n\"Blackberries?\"\n\n\"She was Irish; the Irish peasants won't touch blackberries, you know.\nWe're just as bad, Louise. Heaps of fungi are delicious--wait till\nyou've been in Germany. They know what's good: but, then, they won't\ntouch rabbits, so there you are! I expect my nurse's aunt thought us an\nodd lot, us humans.\"\n\n\"Was she really a fairy?\" Louise was breathless.\n\n\"How do I know? A witch perhaps. I should think a young witch, by all\naccounts.\"\n\n\"What happened to her?\"\n\n\"She was 'swept' on her wedding-day.\"\n\n\"Crossing water?\"\n\n\"No. She was to marry an old farmer. She went into the woods at dawn to\nwash in dew, and gather bindweed for her wreath----\" She paused\ndramatically, her eyes dancing with fun; but Louise was wholly in\nearnest.\n\n\"Go on! Oh, go on!\"\n\n\"She was never seen again.\"\n\n\"Oh, how lovely!\" Louise shivered ecstatically. \"I wish I'd been her.\nWhat did her foster people do?\"\n\n\"What could they? I think they were glad to be rid of her.\" (Clare\nsuppressed a certain tall young gipsy, who had figured suspiciously in\nthe original narrative.) \"Fairy blood is ill to live with, Louise. I\ndon't envy Mrs. Blake, or Mrs. Thomas Rhymer.\"\n\n\"No. But it's so difficult to live in two worlds at once.\"\n\n\"Shouldering the wise man's burden already?\"\n\n\"You get absent-minded, and forget--ink-stains, you know, and messages.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Clare.\n\n\"You see, I have such a gorgeous world inside my head, Miss Hartill: I\ngo there when I'm rather down, here. It's a sort of Garden of the\nHesperides, and you are there, and Mother, and all my special friends.\"\n\n\"Who, for instance?\" Clare was curious; it was the first she had heard\nof Louise with friends of her own.\n\n\"Well--Elizabeth Bennett, and the Little Women, and Garm, and Amadis of\nGaul----\"\n\n\"Oh--not real people?\" Clare was amused at herself for being relieved.\n\n\"Oh, but Miss Hartill--they are real.\" Louise was indignant. \"Ever so\nmuch more than--oh, most people! Look at Mrs. Bennett and Mamma! Nobody\nwill think of Mamma in a hundred years--but who'd ever forget Mrs.\nBennett?\"\n\n\"Mrs Bennett in the Garden of the Hesperides, Louise?\" Clare began to\nchuckle. \"I can't swallow that.\"\n\nLouise pealed with laughter.\n\n\"You should have seen her the other day, with the dragon after her.\nShe'd been trying to sneak some apples, because Bingley was coming to\ntea.\"\n\n\"Who came to the rescue?\"\n\n\"Oh, I did.\" Louise was revelling in her sympathetic listener. \"I have\nto keep order, you know. She was awfully blown, though. Siegfried helped\nme.\"\n\n\"I wish I could get to fairyland as easily as you do.\"\n\nLouise considered.\n\n\"I don't. My country is only in my head. Fairyland must be somewhere,\nmustn't it? Do you know what I think, Miss Hartill?\"\n\n\"In patches, Louise.\"\n\nLouise blushed.\n\n\"No, but seriously--don't laugh. You know you explained the fourth\ndimension to us the other day?\"\n\n\"That I'm sure I never did.\" Clare was lying back in her chair, her arms\nbehind her head, smiling inscrutably.\n\n\"Oh, but Miss Hartill----\"\n\n\"Never, Louise!\"\n\n\"Oh, but honestly--I'm not contradicting you, of course--but you did.\nLast Thursday fortnight, in second lesson.\"\n\n\"I wish you were as accurate over all your dates, Louise! Your History\npaper was not all that it should be.\"\n\n\"It's holidays, Miss Hartill! But don't you remember?\"\n\n\"I explained to you that the fourth dimension was inexplicable--a very\ndifferent thing.\"\n\n\"_The Plattner Story_ explains it--clearly.\" Louise's tone was\ndistinctly reproachful.\n\n\"Oh no, it doesn't, Louise. Mr. Wells only deludes you into thinking it\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow, I think--don't you think that it's rather likely that\nfairyland is the fourth dimension? It would all fit in so beautifully\nwith all the old stories of enchantment and disappearances. Then there\nwas another book I read about it. _The Inheritors_----\"\n\n\"Have done, Louise! You make me dizzy. Don't try to live exclusively on\ntruffles. If you could continue to confine your attention to books you\nhave some slight chance of understanding, for the next few years, it\nwould be an excellent thing. Neither Meredith nor the fourth dimension\nis meat for babes, you know.\"\n\n\"I like what I don't understand. It's the finding out is the fun.\"\nLouise looked mutinous.\n\n\"And having found out?\"\n\n\"Then I start on something else.\"\n\nClare considered her.\n\n\"Louise, I don't know if it's a compliment to either of us--but I\nbelieve we're very much alike.\"\n\nLouise gave a child's delighted chuckle, but she showed no surprise.\n\n\"That's nice, Miss Hartill.\" She hesitated. \"Miss Hartill, did you know\nmy Mother?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Denny?\" Clare hesitated.\n\nLouise gave an impatient gesture.\n\n\"Not Mamma. My very own Mother.\"\n\n\"No, my dear.\" Clare's voice was soft.\n\nLouise sighed.\n\n\"No one does. There are no pictures. Father was angry when I asked about\nher once: and Miss Murgatroyd--she was our governess--she said I had no\ntact. I miss her, you know, though I don't remember her. I had a nurse:\nshe told me a little. Mother had grey eyes too, you know,\" said Louise,\ngazing into Clare's. \"I expect she was rather like you.\"\n\nShe watched Clare a little breathlessly. There was more of tenderness in\nher face than many who thought they knew Clare Hartill would have\ncredited, but no hint of awakening memory, of the recognition the child\nsought. She went on--\n\n\"People never come back when they're dead, do they?\" She had no idea of\nthe longing in her voice.\n\n\"No, you poor baby!\" Clare rose hastily and began to walk up and down\nthe room, as her fashion was when she was stirred.\n\n\"Never?\"\n\n\"'_Stieg je ein Freund Dir aus dem Grabe wieder?_'\" murmured Clare.\n\n\"What, Miss Hartill?\"\n\n\"Never, Louise.\"\n\nLouise's thistledown fancies were scattered by her tone. Impossible to\ndiscredit any statement of Miss Hartill's. Yet she protested timidly.\n\n\"There was the Witch of Endor, Miss Hartill. Samuel, you know.\"\n\n\"Is that Meredith?\" said Clare absently. Then she caught Louise's\nexpression. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"But it's the Bible!\" cried Louise horrified.\n\nClare sat down again and began to laugh pleasantly.\n\n\"What am I to do with you, Louise? Are you five or fifty? You want to\ndiscuss Meredith with me--(not that I shall let you, my child--don't\nthink I approve of all this reading--I did it myself at your age, you\nsee) and five minutes later you look at me round-eyed because I've\nforgotten my Joshua or my Judges! Kings? I beg your pardon; Kings be it!\nNever mind, Louise. Tell me about the Witch of Endor.\"\n\n\"Only that she called up Samuel, I meant, from the dead.\"\n\nLouise was evidently abstracted; she was picking her words.\n\n\"Don't you believe it, Miss Hartill, quite?\"\n\n\"It's the Old Testament, after all,\" temporised Clare. She began to see\nLouise's difficulty. She had no beliefs herself but she thought she\nwould find out how fourteen handled the problem.\n\n\"Then the New is different? There was Dorcas, you know, and the widow's\nson. That is all true, Miss Hartill?\"\n\nClare fenced.\n\n\"Many people think so.\"\n\n\"I want to know the truth,\" said Louise tensely. \"I want to know what\nyou think.\" She spoke as if the two things were synonymous.\n\nClare shook her head.\n\n\"I won't help you, Louise. You must find out for yourself. Leave it\nalone, if you're wise.\"\n\n\"How can I? I've been reading----\"\n\n\"Ah?\"\n\n\"The _Origin of Species_--and _We Two_.\"\n\nClare's gravity fled. She lay back shaking with laughter.\n\n\"Louise, you're delightful! Anything else?\"\n\nLouise pulled up her footstool to Clare's knee.\n\n\"Miss Hartill, I've been reading a play. It's horrible. I can't bear it,\nthough it was thrilling to read----\"\n\nClare interrupted.\n\n\"Where do you get all these books, Louise?\"\n\n\"They are all Mother's, you know. Nobody else wants them. And then\nthere's the Free Library.\"\n\nClare shuddered. She would sooner have drunk from the tin cup of a\npublic fountain than have handled the greasy volumes of a public\nlibrary.\n\n\"How can you?\" she said disgustedly. \"Dirt and dog-ears!\"\n\nLouise opened her eyes. She was too young to be squeamish.\n\n\"'A book's a book for a' that,'\" she laughed. \"How else am I to get hold\nof any--that I like?\"\n\nClare jerked her head to the lined walls.\n\n\"Help yourself,\" she said.\n\nLouise was radiant.\n\n\"May I? Oh, you are good! I will take such care. I'll cover them in\nbrown paper.\"\n\nShe jumped up and, running across the room, flung herself on her knees\nbefore the wide shelves. Timidly, at first, but with growing\nforgetfulness of Clare, she pulled out here a volume and there a volume,\nhandling them tenderly, yet barely opening each, so eager was she for\nfresh discoveries. She reminded Clare of _Alice_ with the scented\nrushes. Clare was amused by her absorption, and a little touched. The\nchild's attitude to books hinted at the solitariness of her life: she\nrelaxed to them, greeting them as intimates and companions; there was a\nnew appearance on her; she was obviously at home, welcomed by her\nfriends; a very different person to the shy-eyed, prim little prodigy\nher school-fellows knew.\n\nClare, glancing at her now and then, sympathised benevolently, and left\nher to herself; she understood that side of the child; her remark to\nLouise about the resemblance between them had not been made at random;\nshe was constantly detecting traits and tastes in her similar to her\nown. She was interested; she had thought herself unique. Their histories\nwere not dissimilar; she, too, different as her environment had been,\ncould look back on a lonely, self-absorbed childhood; she, too, had had\nforced and premature successes. They had not been empty ones, she\nreflected complacently; she had used those schoolgirl triumphs as\nstepping-stones. She doubted if Louise could do the same: there was\nsomething unpractical about Louise--a hint of the visionary in her air.\nShe had at present none of Clare's passion for power and the incense of\nsuccess. Clare, quite aware of her failing, aware that it was a failing\nand perversely proud of it, yet hoped that she should not see it\nsprouting in the character of Louise. She hated to see her own defects\nreproduced (ineffably vulgarised) in others; it jarred her pride. The\ndiscovery of the resemblance between herself and Louise amused and\ncharmed her, as long as it was confined to the qualities that Clare\nadmired; but if the girl began to reflect her faults, Clare knew that\nshe should be irritated.\n\nShe considered these things as she sat and sewed. She was an exquisite\nneedlewoman. The frieze of tapestry that ran round the low-ceilinged\nroom was her own work. Alwynne had designed it--a history of the loves\nof Deirdre and Naismi some months before, when she and Clare had\ndiscovered Yeats together; and Clare had adapted the rough, clever\nsketches, working with her usual amazing speed. The foot-deep strips of\nneedlework and painted silk, with their golden skies and dark\nforegrounds, along which the dim, rainbow figures moved, were just what\nClare had wanted to complete her panelled room; for she was\nbeauty-loving and house-proud, though her love of originality, or more\ncorrectly her tendency to be superior and aloof, often enticed her into\nbizarrerie. But the Deirdre frieze was as harmonious as it was unusual;\nand Clare, as she daily feasted her eyes on the rich, mellow colours,\nwas only annoyed that the idea of it had been Alwynne's. That fact,\nthough she would not own it, was able, though imperceptibly, to taint\nClare's pleasure. She was quite unnecessarily scrupulous in mentioning\nAlwynne's share in the work to any one who admired it; but it piqued her\nto do so, none the less. If any one had told her that it piqued her she\nwould have been extremely amused at the absurdity of the idea.\n\nShe was at the time working out a medallion of her own design, and\ngrowing interested, she soon forgot all about Louise, sitting Turkish\nfashion at the big book-case. The light had long since faded and the\nenormous fire, gilding walls and furniture, rendered the candles' steady\nlight almost superfluous. Candlelight was another predilection of\nClare's--there was neither electricity nor gas in her tiny, perfect\nflat. The tick of the clock in the hall and the flutter of turning pages\nalone broke the silence. Outside, the snow fell steadily.\n\nHalf-a-mile away Alwynne Durand, drumming on the window-pane, while her\naunt dozed in her chair, thought incessantly of Clare, and was filled\nwith restless longing to be with her. She tried to count the snowflakes\ntill her brain reeled. She felt cold and dreary, but she would not rouse\nElsbeth by making up the fire. She wished she had something new to read.\nShe thought it the longest Christmas Day she had ever spent.\n\nThe neat maid, bringing in the tea-tray, roused Clare. She pushed aside\nher work and began to pour out; but Louise in her corner, made no sign.\n\nClare laughed.\n\n\"Louise, wake up! Don't you want any tea?\"\n\nLouise, as if the conversation had not ceased for an instant, scrambled\nto her feet and came to the table, a load of books in her arms, saying\nas she did so--\n\n\"I'll be awfully careful. May I take these, perhaps?\"\n\nClare nodded.\n\n\"Presently. I'll look them over first. Muffins?\"\n\nShe gave Louise a delightful meal and taught her to take tea with a\nslice of lemon. She was particular, Louise noticed; some of the muffins\nwere not toasted to her liking, and were instantly banished; she\ncriticised the cakes and the flavouring of the dainty sandwiches; then\nshe laughed wickedly at Louise for her round eyes.\n\n\"What's the matter, child?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Louise, embarrassed.\n\n\"I believe you're shocked because I talked so much about food?\"\n\nLouise blushed scarlet.\n\n\"I like eating, Louise.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, of course,\" she concurred hastily.\n\nClare was entertained. She knew quite well that Louise, like all\nchildren, considered a display of interest in food, if not indelicate,\nat least extremely human. She knew, too, that in Louise's eyes she was\ntoo entirely compounded of ideals and noble qualities to be more than\nofficially human. She enjoyed upsetting her ideas.\n\n\"If you come to actual values, I'd rather do without Shakespeare than\nMrs. Beeton,\" she remarked blandly.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Hartill!\" Louise was protesting--suspecting a trap--ready to\nripple into laughter. \"You do say queer things.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes. As if you meant that!\"\n\n\"But I do! Eating's an art, Louise, like painting or writing. I had a\npheasant last Sunday----\" She gave the entire menu, and enlarged on the\netceteras with enthusiasm.\n\nLouise looked bewildered.\n\n\"I never thought you thought about that sort of thing,\" she remarked. \"I\nthought you just didn't notice--I thought you would always be thinking\nof poetry and pictures----\" She subsided, blushing.\n\nClare laughed at her pleasantly.\n\n\"I thought, I thought, I think, I thought! What a lot of thoughts. I'm\nsorry, Louise! Is all my star-dust gone?\"\n\nLouise shook her head vigorously, but she was still embarrassed. She\nchanged the subject with agility.\n\n\"I've read that!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The star-dust book--but I've picked out two others of his. May I? All\nthese?\"\n\nClare ran her finger along the titles.\n\n\"Yes--yes--Fiona Mcleod--yes--_Peer Gynt_--yes, if you like, you won't\nunderstand it, or Yeats--but all right. No, not Nietzsche! Not on any\naccount, Louise.\"\n\nLouise protested.\n\n\"Oh, why not, Miss Hartill? I'm nearly fourteen.\"\n\n\"Are you really?\" said Clare, with respect.\n\n\"He looks so jolly--Old Testamenty----\"\n\n\"He does, Louise! That's his little way. But he's not for the Upper\nFifth.\"\n\n\"He's in the Free Library,\" said Louise, with a twinkle. Clare turned.\n\n\"You can have all the books you want, if you come to me. But no more\nFree Library, Louise. You understand? I don't wish it.\"\n\nLouise tingled like a bather under a cold spray. She liked and disliked\nthe autocratic tone.\n\nClare went on.\n\n\"I detest trash--and there's a good deal, even in a Carnegie collection.\nThere's no need for you to dull your imagination on melodrama like--what\nwas it?\"\n\n\"What, Miss Hartill?\"\n\n\"The play you began to tell me about--you thought it horrible, you\nsaid.\"\n\nLouise opened her eyes.\n\n\"Miss Hartill, it wasn't melodrama--it was good stuff. That's why it\nworried me. It's by a Norwegian or a Dane or some one. _Pastor Sang_\nit's called.\"\n\n\"That? I don't follow. I should have thought the theology would have\nbored you, but there's nothing horrible in it.\"\n\n\"It worried me. Oh, Miss Hartill, what does it all mean? Darwin says, we\njust grew--doesn't he? and that the Bible's all wrong. But you say that\ndoesn't matter--it's just Old Testament? And this play says--do you\nremember? the wife is ill--and the husband, who cures people by\npraying--he can't cure her----\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Clare impatiently.\n\n\"And he says, if the apostles did miracles, we ought to be able to--he\nkills his wife, trying. He can't, you see. But the point is, if he\ncouldn't, with all his faith--could the apostles? And if the apostles\ncouldn't, could Christ Himself? The miracles are just only a tale,\nperhaps?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Clare. \"You're not clear, Louise, but I know what you\nmean.\"\n\n\"It frightened me, that play,\" said the child in a low voice. \"If there\nwere no miracles--and everything one reads makes one sure there\nweren't--why, then, the Bible's not true! Jesus was just a man! He\ndidn't rise? Perhaps there isn't an afterwards? Perhaps there isn't\nGod?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Clare.\n\nThe child's eyes were wide and frightened. She put her hand timidly on\nClare's knee.\n\n\"Miss Hartill--you believe in God?\"\n\nClare looked at her, weighing her.\n\nLouise spoke again; her voice had grown curiously apprehensive.\n\n\"Miss Hartill--you do believe in God?\"\n\nClare shrugged her shoulders.\n\nLouise stared at her appalled.\n\n\"If _you_ don't believe in God----\" she began slowly, and then stopped.\n\nThey sat a long while in silence.\n\nClare felt uncomfortable. She had not intended to express any opinion,\nto let her own attitude to religion appear. But Louise, with her sudden\nquestion, had forced one from her. After all, if Louise had begun to\ndoubt and to inquire, no silence on Clare's part would stop her....\nEvery girl went through the phase--with Louise it had begun early, that\nwas all.... Yet in her heart she knew that Louise, with her already\noverworked mind, should have been kept from the mental distress of\nreligious doubt.... She knew that for some years she could have been so\nkept; that, as the mouth can eat what the body will not absorb, so,\nthough her intelligence might have assimilated all the books she chose\nto read, her soul need not necessarily have been disturbed by them. Her\nacquired knowledge that the world is round need not have jostled her\nrule of thumb conviction that it is flat. Her interest in 'ologies and\n'osophies could have lived comfortably enough, with her child's belief\nin four angels round her head, for another two or three\nyears--strengthening, maturing years.\n\nClare knew her power. At a soothing word from her, Louise would have\nshelved her speculations, or at least have continued them impersonally.\nClare could have guaranteed God to her. But Clare had shrugged her\nshoulders, and Louise had grown white--and she had felt like a\nmurderess. Do children really take their religion so seriously?... After\nall, what real difference could it make to Louise?... She, Clare, had\nbeen glad to be rid of her clogging and irrational beliefs.... Louise,\ntoo, when she recovered from the shock, would enjoy the sense of freedom\nand self-respect.... If Louise talked like a girl of eighteen she could\nnot be expected to receive the careful handling you gave a child of\ntwelve.... Anyhow, it was done now....\n\nSuddenly and persuasively she began to talk to Louise. She touched\ngently on the history, the growth and inevitable decay of all\nreligions--the contrasting immutability of the underlying code of\nethics, upon which they, one and all, were founded. She told her vivid\nlittle stories of the religious struggles of the centuries, had her\nbreathless over the death of Socrates, nailed up for her anew the\nninety-five theses to the Wittenberg church door. Exerting all her\npowers, all her knowledge, all her descriptive and dramatic skill, to\ncharm away one child's distress, Clare was, for an hour, a woman\ntransformed, sound and honey-sweet. Against all that happened later, she\ncould at least put the one hour, when, remorsefully, she had given\nLouise of the best that was in her.\n\nIncidentally, she delivered to her audience of one the most brilliant\nlecture of her career. Later she wrote down what she remembered of it,\nand it became the foundation for her monograph on religions that was to\nbecome a minor classic. Its success was immediate--that was typical of\nClare--but she never wrote another line. That also was typical of Clare.\nIt bored her to repeat a triumph.\n\nShe soon had Louise happy again: it was not in Louise to stick to the\nhigh-road of her own thoughts, with Miss Hartill opening gates to\nfairyland at every sentence. Clare kept her for the rest of the evening,\nand took her home at last, weighed down by her parcel of books, sleepy\nfrom the effects of excitement and happiness. She poured out her\nincoherent thanks as they waited on the doorstep of her home. There had\nnever been such a Christmas--she had never had such a glorious time--she\ncouldn't thank Miss Hartill properly if she talked till next Christmas\ncame.\n\nClare, nodding and laughing, handed her over to the maid, and went home,\nnot ill-pleased with her Christmas either. She thought of the child as\nshe walked down the snowy, star-lighted streets, and wondered\nwhimsically what she was doing at the moment. Would she say her prayers\non her way to bed still, or had Clare's little, calculated shrug stopped\nthat sort of thing for many a long day? She rather thought so. She shook\noff her uneasy sense of compunction and laughed aloud. The cold night\nair was like wine to her. After all, for an insignificant spinster, she\nhad a fair share of power--real power--not the mere authority of kings\nand policemen. Her mind, not her office, ruled a hundred other minds,\nand in one heart, at least, a shrug of her shoulders had toppled God off\nHis throne; and the vacant seat was hers, to fill or flout as she\nchose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nWith the opening of the spring term began the final and most arduous\npreparations for the Easter examinations.\n\nThe school had been endowed, some years before, under the will of a\nformer pupil, with a scholarship, a valuable one, ensuring not only the\nfreedom of the school, but substantial help in the subsequent college\ncareer, that the winning of it entailed.\n\nThe rules were strict. The papers were set and corrected by persons\nchosen by the trustees of the bequest. The scholarship was open to the\nschool, but no girl over seventeen might enter: and though an\nunsuccessful candidate might compete a second time, she must gain a\npercentage of marks in the first attempt. Total failure debarred her\nfrom making a second. This last rule limited in effect, the entries to\nmembers of the Sixths and Fifths, for the scholarship was too valuable\nfor a chance of it to be risked through insufficient training. The\nstandard, too, was high, and the rules so strictly enforced that\nwithheld the grant if it were not attained, that Miss Marsham was\naccustomed to make special arrangements for those competing. They were\ncalled the \"Scholarship Class,\" and had certain privileges and a great\namount of extra work. To most of them the particular privilege that\ncompensated for six months' drudgery was the fact that they were almost\nentirely under Miss Hartill's supervision. She considered their training\nher special task and spared neither time nor pains. She loved the\nbusiness. She understood the art of rousing their excitement, pitting\nambition against ambition. She worked them like slaves, weeding out\nremorselessly the useless members. Theoretically all had the right to\nenter; but none remained against Miss Hartill's wishes.\n\nIn spite of the work, the members of the Scholarship Class had an envied\nposition in the school. Clare saw to that. Without attackable bias, she\ndifferentiated subtly between them and the majority. Each of the group\nwas given to understand, without words, impalpably, yet very definitely,\nthat if Miss Hartill, the inexorable, could have a preference, one had\nbut to look in the glass to find it; and that to outstrip the rest of\nthe class, to be listed an easy first, would be the most exquisite\njustification that preference could have. And as the type of girl who\nsuccumbed the most surely to Clare's witchcraft was also usually of the\ntype to whom intellectual work was in itself attractive, it was not\nsurprising if her favourite class were a hot-bed of emulation and\nenthusiasm--enthusiasm that was justified of its origin, for not even\nHenrietta Vigers denied that Clare contributed her full share to the\nearning of the scholarship, Miss Marsham, towards the end of the spring,\nwas wont to declare, with her usual kindly concern, that she was\nthankful that the examination was not an annual affair.... Their good\nMiss Hartill was too anxious, too conscientious.... Miss Marsham must\nreally forbid her to make herself ill. And, indeed, when the class was a\nlarge one, Clare was as reckless of her own strength as of that of her\npupils, and suffered more from its expenditure. Where they were\nresponsible, each for herself, Clare toiled early and late for them all.\nShe fed them, moreover, from her own resources of energy, was entirely\nwilling to devitalise herself on their behalf. The strain once over, she\nappeared slack, gaunt, debilitated. She had, however, her own methods of\nrecuperation. Her ends gained, she could take back what she had\ngiven--take back more than ever she had given. Moreover, the supply of\nchild-life never slackened. Old scholars might go--but ever the new ones\ncame. Was it not Clare who gave the school its latter-day reputation? By\nthe end of the summer term Clare would be once more in excellent\ncondition.\n\nWhen the promotion of Louise to the Upper School had first been mooted,\nMiss Hartill had not forgotten that the scholarship examination was once\nmore drawing near. She saw no reason why Louise should not compete. That\nLouise, the whilom dullard of the Third, the youngest girl in the Upper\nSchool, should snatch the prize from the expectants of the Sixths and\nFifths, would be an effective retort on Clare's critics, would redound\nvery pleasantly to Clare's credit.\n\nIf she let the opportunity pass, Louise must wait two years: at thirteen\nit would be a triumph for Louise and Clare; at fifteen there would be\nnothing notable in her success. And the baby herself would be delighted.\nClare was already sufficiently taken with Louise to enjoy the\nanticipation of her delight.\n\nShe was quite aware that it would entail special efforts on her own\npart, as well as on the child's, and that she had a large class already\non her hands, and in need of coaching. But there was always Alwynne.\nAlwynne was so reliable; she could safely leave Louise's routine work in\nAlwynne's hands. It remained to consult Louise and incidentally the\nparent Dennys.\n\nLouise was awestruck, overwhelmed by the honour of being allowed to\ncompete, absurdly and touchingly delighted. No doubt as to Louise's\nsentiments. No doubt as to the sincerity of her efforts. No doubt, until\nthe spring term began, of the certainty of her success.\n\nThe spring term opened with Clare in Miss Marsham's carved seat at\nmorning prayers. The school had grown accustomed to its head-mistress's\noccasional absence. Miss Marsham, who had for some time felt the strain\nof school routine too much for her advanced years, was only able to\nsustain the fiction of her unimpaired powers by taking holidays, as a\nmorphineuse takes her drug, in ever-increasing doses. She was confident\nin the discretion alike of Clare Hartill and Henrietta Vigers, and,\nindeed, but for their efficiency, the school would have suffered more\nquickly than it actually did. Nevertheless, the absence of supreme\nauthority had, though but slightly, the usual disintegrating effect.\nThere was always, naturally, an increase of friction between the two\nwomen, especially when the absence of the directress occurred at the\nbeginning of a term. There would be the usual agitations--problems of\nhousing and classification. There would arrive parents to be interviewed\nand impressed, new girls to be gracefully and graciously welcomed. Clare\n(to whom Henrietta, for all her hostility, invariably turned in\nemergencies), showing delicately yet unmistakably that she considered\nherself unwarrantably hampered in her own work, would submit to being on\nshow with an air of bored acquiescence, tempered with modest surprise at\nthe necessity for her presence. It was sufficiently irritating to\nHenrietta, under strict, if indirect, orders to leave the decorative\nside of the vice-regency to her rival. She was quite aware of Clare's\ngreater effectiveness. She did not believe that it weighed with Miss\nMarsham against her own solid qualities. She affected to despise it. Yet\ndespising, she envied.\n\nShe was unjust to Clare, however, in believing the latter's reluctance\nentirely assumed. Clare enjoyed ruffling the susceptibilities of\nHenrietta, but she was none the less genuinely annoyed at being even\npartially withdrawn from her classes and was relieved when, at the end\nof a fortnight, Miss Marsham returned to her post. Clare had been forced\nto neglect her special work. Classes had been curtailed and interrupted,\nthe many extra lessons postponed or turned over to Alwynne, whom more\nthan any other mistress she had trained and could trust.\n\nIt was Alwynne who, reporting to her at the end of the first fortnight,\nhad made her more than ever eager to be rid of her deputyship.\n\nThere were new girls in the Fifth in whom Alwynne was interested. One,\nat least, she prophesied, would be found to have stuff in her. It was a\npity she was not in the Scholarship Class.... She was too good for the\nLower Fifth.... Alwynne supposed it would be quite impossible to let\nher enter?\n\n\"At this time of day? Impossible! Do you realise that we've only another\nthree months?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose she'd want to, anyhow,\" said Alwynne. \"She's a quaint\nperson! Talk about independence! She informed me to-day that she\nshouldn't stay longer than half-term, unless she liked us.\"\n\n\"Oho! Young America!\" Clare was alert. \"I didn't know you referred to\nCynthia Griffiths. I interviewed the parents last week. Immensely rich!\nShe was demure enough, but I gathered even then that she ruled the\nroost. Her mother was quite tearful--implored me to keep her happy for\nthree months anyhow, while they both indulged in a rest cure abroad. She\nseemed doubtful of our capacities. But she was not explicit.\"\n\n\"Cynthia is. I've heard the whole story while I tried to find out how\nmuch she knew. She's a new type. Her French and her German are\nperfect--and her clothes. Her bedroom is a pig-sty and she gets up when\nshe chooses. I gather that she has reduced Miss Vigers to a nervous\nwreck already. Thank goodness I'm a visiting mistress! I wonder what the\ngirls will make of her!\"\n\n\"Or she of them.\"\n\n\"That won't be the question,\" surmised Alwynne shrewdly. \"Clare, she has\nfive schools behind her, American and foreign--and she's fifteen! We are\nan incident. I know. There were two Americans at my school.\"\n\n\"It remains to be seen.\" Clare's eyes narrowed. \"Well, what else?\"\n\nAlwynne fidgeted.\n\n\"I'm glad you're taking over everything again. I prefer my small kids.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Easier to understand--and manage.\"\n\nClare looked amused.\n\n\"Been getting into difficulties? Who's the problem? Agatha?\"\n\n\"That wind-bag! She only needs pricking to collapse,\" said Alwynne\ncontemptuously. Then, with a frown: \"I wish poor little Mademoiselle\nCharette would realise it. Have you ever seen a Lower Fifth French\nlesson? But, of course, you haven't. It's a farce.\"\n\nClare frowned.\n\n\"If she can't keep order----\"\n\n\"She can teach anyhow,\" said Alwynne quickly. \"I was at the other end of\nthe room once, working. I listened a little. It's only Agatha.\nMademoiselle can tackle the others. She's effective in a delicate way;\nbut senseless, noisy rotting--it breaks her up. She loses her temper. Of\ncourse, it's funny to watch. But I hate that sort of thing. I did when I\nwas a schoolgirl even, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I don't remember.\" But in the back of Clare's mind was a class-room and\nherself, contemptuously impertinent to a certain ineffective Miss\nLoveday.\n\nAlwynne continued, frowning--\n\n\"Anyhow, I wish you'd do something.\"\n\nClare yawned.\n\n\"One mustn't interfere with other departments--unasked.\"\n\n\"Well, I ask you.\" Alwynne was in earnest.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I want you to.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nAlwynne blushed.\n\n\"Why this championship? I didn't know you and Mademoiselle Charette were\nsuch intimates?\"\n\n\"It's just because we aren't. I like her, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Well--we had a row. You see--You won't tell, Clare?\"\n\nClare smiled.\n\n\"She doesn't like you,\" blurted out Alwynne indignantly. \"And I just\nwant to show her how altogether wrong----\"\n\n\"What a crime! How did you find it out?\" Clare was amused.\n\n\"She was telling me about Agatha. And I said--why on earth didn't she\ncomplain to you? And she said--nothing on earth would induce her to. I\nsaid--I was sure you would be only too glad for her to ask you. And she\nsaid----\" Alwynne paused dramatically: \"She said--she hadn't the\nfaintest doubt you would, and that I was a charming child, but that she\nhappened to understand you. Then we had a row of course.\"\n\nClare pealed with laughter.\n\n\"She's quite right, Alwynne. You are a charming child. So that is\nMademoiselle Charette, is it? And I never guessed.\" She mused, a curious\nlittle smile on her lips.\n\n\"She's a dear, really,\" said Alwynne apologetically. \"Only she's what\nMrs. Marpler calls ''aughty.' I can't think why her knife's into you.\"\n\n\"Suppose----\" Clare's eyes lit up, she showed the tip of her\ntongue--sure sign of mischief afloat. \"Suppose I pull it out? What do\nyou bet me, Alwynne?\"\n\nAlwynne laughed.\n\n\"I wish you would. I don't like it when people don't appreciate you.\nAnyhow, I wish you'd settle Agatha. You know, it's not doing the\nscholarship French any good. The class slacks. Mademoiselle is worried,\nI know.\"\n\nClare was serious at once.\n\n\"That must stop. The standard's too high for trifling. And one or two of\nthem are weak as it is. Especially Louise. Isn't she? Don't you coach\nher for the grammar? How is her extra work getting on, by the way? Like\na house on fire, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not altogether.\" Alwynne looked uneasy.\n\n\"What?\" Clare looked incredulous.\n\n\"She's the problem,\" said Alwynne.\n\nShe had a piece of paper on the table before her and was drawing\nfantastic profiles as she spoke, sure sign of perturbation with Alwynne,\nas Clare knew.\n\n\"Well?\" demanded Clare, after an interval.\n\nAlwynne paused, pencil hovering over an empty eyesocket. She seemed\nnervous, opened her lips once or twice and closed them again.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Clare prompted her.\n\n\"Nothing's wrong exactly.\" Alwynne flushed uncomfortably. \"After all,\nyou've seen her in class. Her work is as good as usual?\"\n\n\"I think so. Her last essay was a little exotic, by the bye, not quite\nas natural--but you corrected them. I was so busy.\"\n\n\"You don't think she's getting too keen, working too hard?\" Alwynne's\ntone was tentative.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" Clare was thoroughly interested. She was tickled at\nAlwynne's anxious tones. She always enjoyed her occasional bursts of\nresponsibility. But she was nevertheless intrigued by Alwynne's hints.\nShe had certainly not given her class its usual attention lately. To\nLouise she had scarcely spoken unofficially since term began; no\nopportunity had occurred, and she had been too busy to make one. Louise\nhad returned a bundle of books to her on the opening day of the term,\nand had been bidden to fetch herself as many more as she chose. But\nClare had been out when Louise had called. Clare, to tell the truth, had\nnot once given a thought to Louise since Christmas Day. She had taken a\ntrip to London with Alwynne soon after. The two had enjoyed themselves.\nThe holidays had flown. But she had been glad to find her class\nradiantly awaiting her. She had found it much as usual. Alwynne's\nperturbation was the more intriguing.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" she repeated, with a lift of her eyebrows that\nreduced Alwynne's status to that of a Kindergarten pupil teacher. She\nenjoyed seeing her grow pink.\n\n\"Of course, it's no affair of mine,\" said Alwynne aggrievedly. She went\non with her drawing.\n\nClare swung herself on to the low table and sat, skirts a-sway, gazing\ndown at Alwynne's head, bent over its grotesques. There was a curl at\nthe nape of the neck that fascinated her. It lay fine and shining like a\nbaby's. She picked up a pencil and ran it through the tendril. Alwynne\njumped.\n\n\"Clare, leave me alone. You only think I'm impertinent.\"\n\n\"Does she want a finger in the pie, then?\" said Clare softly. \"Poor old\nAlwynne!\" The pencil continued its investigations.\n\nAlwynne tried not to laugh. She could never resist Clare's soft voice,\nas Clare very well knew.\n\n\"I don't! I only thought----\"\n\n\"That Louise--your precious Louise----\"\n\n\"She's trying so awfully hard----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"She's overdoing it. The work's not so good. She's too keen, I\nthink----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I think----\"\n\n\"Yes, Alwynne?\"\n\n\"You won't be annoyed?\"\n\n\"That depends.\"\n\n\"Then I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"I think you can,\" said Clare levelly.\n\nAlwynne was silent. Clare took the paper from her and examined it.\n\n\"You've a fantastic imagination, Alwynne. When did you dream those\nfaces? Well--and what do you think? Be quick.\"\n\n\"I think she's growing too fond of you,\" said Alwynne desperately.\n\nShe faced Clare, red and apprehensive. She expected an outburst. But\nClare never did what Alwynne expected her to do.\n\n\"Is that all? Pooh!\" said Clare lightly and began to laugh. She swung\nbackwards, her finger-tips crooked round the edge of the table, her neat\nshoes peeping and disappearing beneath her skirts as she rocked herself.\nShe regarded Alwynne with sly amusement.\n\n\"So I've a bad influence, Alwynne? Is that the idea?\"\n\nAlwynne protested redly. Clare continued unheeding.\n\n\"Well, it's a novel one, anyhow. Could you indicate exactly how my\nblighting effect is produced? Don't mind me, you know.\" Then, with a\nchuckle: \"Oh, you delicious child!\"\n\nAlwynne was silent.\n\n\"Tell me all about it, Alwynne dear!\" cooed Clare.\n\nAlwynne shrugged her shoulders with a curiously helpless gesture.\n\n\"I can't,\" she said. \"I thought I could--but I can't. You don't help me.\nI was worried over Louise. I thought--I think she alters. I think she\ngets a strained look. I know she thinks about you all the time. I\nthought--but, of course, if you see nothing, it's my fancy. There's\nnothing definite, I know. If you don't know what I mean----\"\n\n\"I don't!\" said Clare shortly. \"Do you know yourself?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Alwynne. She searched Clare's face wistfully. \"I just thought\nperhaps--she was too fond of you--I can't put it differently. I'm a\nfool! I wish I hadn't said anything.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Clare gravely.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interfere: it wasn't impertinence, Clare,\" said\nAlwynne, her cheeks flaming.\n\nClare hesitated. She was annoyed at Alwynne's unnecessary display of\ninsight, yet tickled by her penetration, not displeased by the jealousy\nwhich, as it seemed to her, must be at the root of the protest. Alwynne\nhad evidently not forgotten her chilly Christmas afternoon.... Louise,\nas obviously, had talked.... There must have been some small degree of\nfriction for Alwynne to complain of Louise.... Curiously, it never\noccurred to Clare that Alwynne's remarks hid no motive, that Alwynne\nwas genuinely anxious and meant exactly what she had said, or tried to\nsay. Possibly in Alwynne's simplicity lay her real attraction for Clare.\nIt made her as much of a sphinx to Clare as Clare was to her.\n\nAs she stood before her, apprehensive of her displeasure, obviously\nafraid that she had exceeded those bounds to their intercourse that she,\nmore than Clare, had laid down, yet withal, a curiously dogged look upon\nher face, Clare was puzzled as to her own wisest attitude. She was\ninclined to batter her into a retraction; it would have relieved her own\nfeelings. Clare could not endure criticism. But she was not yet so sure\nof Alwynne as to allow herself the relief of invective. She thought that\nshe might easily reserve her annoyance for Louise. It was Louise, after\nall, who had exposed her to criticism.... And if Alwynne chose to be\njealous, it was at least a flattering display.... She supposed she must\nplacate Alwynne.... After all, fifty Louises and her own dignity could\nnot weigh against the possession of Alwynne.... She spoke slowly,\nchoosing her words,\n\n\"As if I could think you impertinent! But, my dear--I'm older than you.\nCan't you trust me to understand my girls? After all, I devote my life\nto them, Alwynne.\" Clare's quiet dignity was in itself a reproof.\n\n\"I know.\" Alwynne lifted distressed eyes. \"I didn't mean--I didn't\nimply--of course, you know best. I only thought----\"\n\n\"That I took more notice of Louise than was wise?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" protested Alwynne unhappily.\n\nClare continued--\n\n\"If you think I'm to blame for encouraging a lonely child--she has no\nmother, Alwynne--lending her a few books--asking her to tea with\nme--because I felt rather sorry for her----\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that----\" Alwynne twisted her fingers helplessly.\n\n\"Then what did you mean?\" Clare asked her. She had slipped on to the\nfloor, and was facing Alwynne, very tall and grave and quiet. \"Won't you\ntell me just exactly what you did mean?\" she allowed a glimmer of\ndispleasure to appear in her eyes.\n\nAnd Alwynne, tongue-tied and cornered, had nothing whatever to say. She\nhad been filled with vague uneasiness and had come to Clare to have it\ndispelled. The uneasiness was still there, formless yet insistent--but\nthe only effect of her clumsy phrases was to hurt Clare's feelings.\nAfter all, was she not worrying herself unduly? Was she to know better\nthan Clare? She had felt for some moments that she had made a fool of\nherself. There remained to capitulate. Her anxiety over Louise melted\nbefore the pain in Clare's eyes--the reproof of her manner.\n\n\"Would you like me to speak to Louise, before you?\" went on Clare\npatiently. \"Perhaps she could explain what it is that worries you----\"\n\n\"No, no! for goodness' sake, Clare!\" cried Alwynne, appalled. Then\nsurrendering, \"Clare--I didn't mean anything. I do see--I've been\nfussing--impertinent--whatever you like. I didn't mean any harm. Oh,\nlet's stop talking about it, please.\"\n\n\"I'd rather you convinced yourself first,\" said Clare frigidly. \"I don't\nwant the subject re-opened once a week.\" Then relenting, \"Poor old\nAlwynne! The trials of a deputy! Has she worried herself to death? But\nI'm back now. I think I can manage my class, Alwynne--as long as you\nstand by to give me a word of advice now and then.\"\n\nAlwynne squirmed. Clare laughed tenderly.\n\n\"My dear--give Louise a little less attention. It won't hurt either of\nyou. Are you going to let me feel neglected?\" Then, with a change of\ntone. \"Now we've had enough of this nonsense.\" She curled herself in her\nbig chair. \"Alwynne, there's a box of Fuller's in the cupboard, and an\nEnglish Review. Don't you want to hear the new Masefield before you go\nhome?\"\n\nAnd Alwynne's eyes grew big, and she forgot all about Louise, as Clare's\n\"loveliest voice\" read out the rhyme of _The River_.\n\nYet Clare had a last word as she sent her home to Elsbeth.\n\n\"Sorry?\" said Clare whimsically, as Alwynne bade her good-bye.\n\n\"I always was a fool,\" said Alwynne, and hugged her defiantly.\n\nBut Clare, for once, made no protest. She patted her ruffled hair as she\nlistened to the noises of the departure.\n\n\"Too fond of me?\" she said softly. \"Too fond of me? Alwynne--what about\nyou?\"\n\nBut if Alwynne heard, she made no answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nMiss Marsham was accustomed to recognise that it was the brief career of\nCynthia Griffiths that first induced her to consider the question of her\nown retirement.\n\nIt is certain that the school was never again quite as it had been\nbefore her advent. The Cynthia Griffiths term remained a school date\nfrom which to reckon as the nation reckons from the Jubilee. In an\nAmerican school Cynthia Griffiths must have been at least a disturbing\nelement--in the staid English establishment, with its curious mixture of\nmodern pedagogy and Early Victorian training, she was seismic.\n\nWith their usual adaptability, the new girls, as they accustomed\nthemselves subduedly to the strange atmosphere, had found nothing to\ncavil at in the school arrangements. They had not thought it incongruous\nto come from Swedish exercises to prolonged and personal daily prayers,\nkneeling for ten minutes at a time while their head mistress wrestled\nwith Deity. It might have bored girls of sixteen and eighteen to learn\ntheir daily Bible verse, and recite it alternately with the Kindergarten\nand Lower School, but it never occurred to them to protest, any more\nthan they were likely to object to the little note-book which each girl\ncarried, with its printed list of twenty-five possible crimes, and the\ndangling pencil wherewith, at tea-time, to mark herself innocent or\nguilty. The hundred and one rules that Edith Marsham had found useful in\nthe youth of her seminary, forty years before, and that time had\nrendered obsolete, irritating, or merely unintelligible, were\nnevertheless endured with entire good nature by her successions of\npupils. Alwynne and her contemporaries might fume in private and Clare\nshrug her shoulders in languid tolerance, but nobody thought it worth\nwhile to question directly the entire sufficiency of a bygone system to\nthe needs of the new century's hockey-playing generations.\n\nBut a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.\n\nWhat, if you please, is an old lady to do? An old lady, declining on her\npleasant seventies, owning sixty, not a day more, traditionally\nawe-inspiring and unapproachable, whose security lies in the legends\nthat have grown up of the terrors of her eye and tongue, when Young\nAmerica clamours at her intimidating door? Young America, calm-eyed,\ncourteous, coaxing, squatting confidentially at the feet of Authority,\ndemanding counsel and comfort. Useless for harried Authority to suggest\nconsultation with equally harried assistants. Young America, with a\ncharming smile and the prettiest of gestures, would rather talk it over\nquietly with Authority's self. Authority, who is the very twin of her\ndear old Grannie at home, will be sure to understand. Such fusses about\nnothing all day and every day! Can it be that Authority expects her to\nkeep her old bureau tidy, when she's had a maid all her life? Young\nAmerica will be married as soon as she quits Europe (follows a\nconfidential sketch of the more promising of Young America's best boys),\nand have her own maid right on. Can Authority, as a matter of cold\ncommon-sense, see any use in bothering over cupboards for just three\nmonths or so? If so--right! Young America will worry along somehow, but\nit seemed kind of foolish, didn't it? Or could Young America hire a\ngirl--like she did in Paris? Anyway it was rough luck on the lady in the\nglasses to get an apoplexy every day, as Authority might take it was the\ncase at present. Another point--could Authority, surveying matters\nimpartially, see any harm in running down town when she was out of\ncandy? It only meant missing ten minutes French, and if there was one\nthing Young America (lapsing suddenly, with bedazing fluency, into that\nlanguage) was sure of, it was French. These English-French classes meant\nwell--but, her God! how they were slow! There had been--Young America\nconfessed it with candid regret--some difficulties with the cute little\nmark-books. Young America had mislaid three in a fortnight. She just put\nthem down, and they lay around awhile, and then they weren't there. Some\nof the ladies had been real annoyed. And once on the subject of\nmark-books, did Authority really mean that she was to chalk it up each\ntime she was late for breakfast, or said \"Darn it,\" or talked in class?\nWould, in her place, Authority be able to keep tally? Couldn't Young\nAmerica just mark off the whole concern and be done with it? Young\nAmerica apologised for worrying Authority with these quaint\nmatters--but, on her honour, every lady in the school seemed to have\ngone plum crazy about them.... They just sat around and yapped at her.\nYoung America was genuinely scared. She had thought a heart-to-heart\nchat with Authority ought to put things right. She would be real\ngrateful to Authority for fixing things....\n\nAnd so, with the odd curtsey she had learned among \"the Dutchies,\" as\nshe called her German pensionat, and a hearty kiss on either cheek,\nYoung America, affable as ever, beamed upon Authority and withdrew.\n\nAuthority felt as if it had been out in a high wind. Instinctively it\nclutched at its imposing head-dress. All was in place. Authority lay\nback in its chair and gasped fishily.\n\nBut Miss Vigers, frenzied into confession of inability to deal with the\nsituation--got scant sympathy.\n\n\"What am I to do? I hate troubling you--I am sure, though, it's a relief\nto us all to have you back. Of course, if you had been at home she would\nnever have been admitted.... You would have realised the\nunsuitability--but it was not my decision.... Miss Hartill.... But what\nam I to do? I flatter myself I can control our English girls--but these\nAmericans! Open defiance, Miss Marsham! Her room! She refuses to attend\nto it. She comes and goes when she chooses. She treats me, positively,\nas an equal. Her influence is unspeakable! It must be stopped! Ten\nminutes late for breakfast--oh, every day! Once, I could excuse. And on\nthe top of it all to offer me chocolates! I must ask you to punish her\nseverely.... Keep her in? Miss Marsham, I did.... I sent her to her\nroom. Miss Marsham, will you believe me? When I went up to her later,\nshe was fast asleep! On the bed! In the daytime!! Without taking off the\ncounterpane!!! Miss Marsham, I leave the matter to you!\"\n\nShe paused for the comments her tale deserved. But to outraged\nAuthority, it had called up a picture--an impudent picture of Young\nAmerica, curled kitten-fashion on its austere white pallet--pink cheek\non rounded arm, guileless eyes opening sleepily under a sour and\nscandalised gaze.\n\nHenrietta started. She could not believe her ears.\n\nBenevolently--unmistakably--Authority had chuckled.\n\nBut the scandal was short-lived. Before the term was over: before\nHenrietta had braced herself to her usual resource, a threat of\nresignation, or Miss Marsham, hesitating between the devil of her\nprotesting subordinates and the deep sea of Young America's unshakable\nconviction that in her directress she had an enthusiastic partisan,\ncould allow her maid to suggest to her that she needed a change, the end\nhad arrived.\n\nCynthia, as Alwynne had surmised, found ten weeks of an English private\nschool more than enough for her; and an imperious telegram had summoned\nher docile parents.\n\nShe departed as she had come, in a joyous flurry. The school mourned,\nand the Common-room, in its relief, sped the parting guest with a\ncordiality that was almost effusive.\n\nA remark of Henrietta's, as the mistress sat over their coffee on the\nafternoon of Cynthia's departure, voiced the attitude of the majority to\nits late pupil.\n\n\"I'm thankful,\" Miss Vigers was unusually talkative, \"deeply thankful\nthat she's gone. An impossible young woman. Oh, no--you couldn't call\nher a girl. Would any girl--any English girl--conceivably behave as she\nhas? They have begun to imitate her, of course. That was to be expected.\nShe demoralised the school. It will take me a month to get things\nstraight. I have three children in bed to-day. Headaches? Fiddlesticks!\nOver-eating! I suppose you heard that there was a midnight feast last\nnight?\"\n\nThe Common-room opened its eyes.\n\n\"I'm not astonished. A farewell gathering, I suppose! I'm sure it's not\nthe first,\" said Clare, her eyes alight with amusement. \"But go on. How\ndid you find it out?\"\n\n\"Miss Marsham informed me of it,\" said Henrietta, with desperate\ncalmness. \"It appears that Cynthia asked her permission. Miss\nMarsham--er--contributed a cake. Seed!\"\n\nClare gurgled.\n\n\"This is priceless. Did she tell you? I wonder she had the face.\"\n\nHenrietta grew pink.\n\n\"No. Cynthia herself. She--er--offered me a slice. She had the\nimpertinence--the entirely American impertinence--to come to my\nroom--after midnight--to borrow a tooth-glass. To eat ices in. It\nappeared that they were short of receptacles.\"\n\n\"Ices?\" came the chorus.\n\n\"Her mother provided them, I believe. In a pail,\" said Henrietta\nstiffly.\n\n\"Did you lend the tooth-glass?\" asked Clare.\n\nHenrietta coughed.\n\n\"It was difficult to refuse. She had bare feet. I did not wish her to\ncatch cold.\"\n\nClare turned away abruptly. Her shoulders shook.\n\n\"I do not wish to be unjust. I do not think she was intentionally\ninsubordinate.\" Henrietta fingered one of the tall pink roses that had\nappeared on her desk that morning. \"I believe she meant well.\"\n\n\"She was a dear!\" said the little gym mistress.\n\n\"She was an impossible young woman,\" retorted Henrietta with spirit. \"At\nthe same time----\"\n\n\"At the same time?\" Clare spoke with unusual friendliness.\n\n\"She certainly had a way with her,\" said Henrietta.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nCynthia Griffiths had set a fashion.\n\nHer kewpie hair-ribbons and abbreviated blouses were an unofficial\nuniform long after she had ceased, probably, to know that such articles\nof dress existed. Her slang phrases incorporated themselves in the\nschool vocabulary. Her deeds of derring-do were imitated from afar. To\nhave been on intimate terms with her would have been an impressive\ndistinction, had not every member of the school been able to lay claim\nto it. For Cynthia's jolly temperament laughed at schoolgirl etiquette,\ncould never be brought to realise the existence of caste and clique. She\ndarted into their lives and out again, like a dragon-fly through a cloud\nof gnats. It was not strange that her beauty, her prodigality, in\nconjunction with the all-excusing fact of her nationality, should have\nattracted the weather-cock enthusiasm of her companions: should have\nmade her, short as her career had been, the rage.\n\nYet the one person on whom that career was to have a lasting influence\nwas, to all appearance, the least affected by it.\n\nCynthia and Louise Denny were class-mates, for Clare, amused and\ninterested by the new type, had, after all, arranged for Cynthia to join\nthe Scholarship Class, though there could be no idea of her entering.\nShe agreed with Alwynne that there was not much likelihood of Cynthia's\nsojourn being a long one. In the meantime, as she had explained to Miss\nMarsham, it was better to have the fire-brand under her own eye. Miss\nMarsham agreed with alacrity, and contrasted Clare's calmly capable\nmanner with the protests of Henrietta. She realised joyfully that\nCynthia would not be permitted to appeal from any decision of Miss\nHartill. She recalled, not for the first time, that in all Clare's years\nthere had never come a crisis for which she had been found unprepared.\nDetails of a campaign might finally reach the ears of Authority--there\nwould be always birds of the air to carry the matter--but from Miss\nHartill herself, no word; if pressed, there would be a brief summary, a\nlaughing comment, never an appeal for help. Miss Marsham had built up\nher school by sheer force of personality. She was old now, grown slack\nand easy, but instinctively she recognised a ruling spirit, a kindred\nmind. One day she must choose her successor.... She was rich. Her school\nneed not fall to the highest bidder.... There were Henrietta and Clare.\nHenrietta had scraped and saved, she knew.... Henrietta was fond of\ntrying on Authority's shoes.... Of Clare's wishes she was less sure....\nBut Clare was a capable girl--a capable girl.... Clare had never let any\none worry her....\n\nShe read Clare correctly. Clare had no intention of allowing Cynthia\nGriffiths to lessen her prestige. But she had her own method of solving\nthe American problem. She treated her new pupil with the easy good\nhumour, the mocking friendliness of an equal. She realised the\nimpossibility of counteracting the effects of a haphazard education, but\nrecognising equally the inherent kindliness and lawlessness of the\ncharacter, played on both qualities in her management of the girl. Her\nclasses were not demoralised, but stimulated, by the new-comer's\npresence: yet Clare had said nothing to Cynthia of rules and\nregulations. But Miss Hartill's manner had certainly implied that while\nto her, too, they were a folly and a weariness, after all it was easy to\nconform. It saved trouble and pleased people. All conveyed without\nprejudice to the morals of her other pupils in a shrug, and a twinkle,\nand a half-finished phrase.\n\nCynthia was charmed. Here was common-sense. For the first time she felt\nherself at home. She appalled the classes by her loud encomiums, her\ndelighted discovery of qualities that it was blasphemy to connect with\nMiss Hartill. For Cynthia, with the pitiful shrewdness that her\ncosmopolitan years had instilled, admired Clare for reasons that\nbewildered the worshippers. To them Clare moved through the school,\napart, Olympian, a goddess, condescending delightfully. To Cynthia,\naccustomed to intrigue, she was obviously and admirably Macchiavellian.\nIt amazed her that the English girls could not perceive Miss Hartill's\ncleverness, that they should adore her for qualities as foreign to her\ncharacter as they were essentially insipid, and be indignant at\nunderstanding and discriminating praise.\n\nBut Cynthia was above all philosophical. She shrugged her shoulders over\nthe crazy crew, and reserved her comments for--Louise. For in Louise,\nincredible as Alwynne Durand, for instance, would have thought it, she\ndid find a listener--an antagonist, easily pricked into amusing\nindignation, into white-hot denials--nevertheless, a listener. Indeed,\nit was the attitude of Cynthia to Clare Hartill rather than her personal\nattraction that was responsible for Louise's departure from her original\nand sincere attitude of indifference to the advances of the popular\nAmerican.\n\nLouise was less in the foreground than she had been in the previous\nterm. She had come back to school, less talkative, less brilliant, but\nworking with a dogged persistence that had on Alwynne, at least, a\ndepressing effect. But Alwynne, also, was seeing less of the girl.\nCynthia Griffiths obstructed her view--Cynthia, taking one of her\nvociferous likings to a sufficiently unresponsive Louise. For the\n_rapprochement_ was scarcely a normal, schoolgirl intimacy. Cynthia\nGriffiths had been intrigued by Louise's personality. She had been quick\nto grasp the importance of the child's position--to guess her there by\nreason of her brains and temperament. Yet to Cynthia, judging life, as\nshe did, chiefly by exterior appearances, Louise, insignificant, timid,\nshadowy, was an incessant denial of her nevertheless recognisable\ninfluence in school politics. In the language of Cynthia, she was a dark\nhorse. Cynthia was charmed--school life was dull--the mildest of\nmysteries was better than none. She would devote herself to deciphering\na new type. This little English kid had undoubted influence with girl\nand mistress alike. Cynthia had intercepted glances between her and Miss\nHartill, and Miss Durand too, that spoke of mutual understanding.\nPerhaps it was money--half the school in her pay? Or secret influences\nof the most sinister? Hypnotism, maybe? Cynthia Griffiths, fed on dime\nnovels and magazine literature, was not ten minutes concocting the\nhopefullest of mare's nests. She approached Louise between excitement\nand suspicion.\n\nCynthia was not scrupulous. She forced her way through the reserves and\ndefences of the younger girl like a bumble-bee clawing and screwing and\nbuzzing into the heart of a half-shut flower.\n\nShe found much to puzzle her, more to amuse, but nothing to justify her\ngorgeous suspicions. She confessed them one day to Louise, in a burst of\nconfidence, and Louise was hugely delighted. Cynthia always delighted\nher. She liked her jolly ways, and her sense of fun, and was quite\nconvinced that she had no sense of humour at all. The conviction saved\nher some suffering. She was jealous, inevitably jealous, of the\nbrilliant new-comer, painfully alive to, exaggerating and writhing at\nClare's preoccupation with her; yet the warped shrewdness proper to her\nstate of mind, she could calculate with painful accuracy how long it\nwould take Clare to tire of her new toy, what qualities would soonest\ninduce satiety. She guessed, hoped, prayed, that Miss Hartill would\ndiscover, as she had done, Cynthia's lack of conscious humour, the\nobtuseness that underlay her boisterous ease. She was not fine enough to\nhold Miss Hartill long: she would grow too fond of Miss Hartill: would,\nin the terrible craving to render up her whole soul, expose herself in\nall her crudity. Louise did, for a while, soothe the jealousy, the\ntearing, clawing beast in her breast, with that comfortable conviction.\nThat her reasoning was subconscious, that she was unaware of the\nprocess of analysation and deduction that led to her conclusions, is\nimmaterial; she felt--and as she felt, she acted; her reasons for her\nactions were sounder than she dreamed.\n\nShe made mistakes often enough: her profound occupation with Clare\nHartill had induced a spiritual myopia; the rest of the world was out of\nfocus; and it was her initial misunderstanding of Cynthia Griffiths that\nled to their curious, unaffectionate alliance. In all Louise's\nponderings, she had never doubted but that Cynthia would, like the rest\nof the world, fall down and worship at the shrine of Clare Hartill.\nCynthia Griffiths, amused spectator of an alien life, did nothing of the\nkind. And Louise--amazed, fiercely incredulous, all-suspicious, yet\nfinally convinced of the inconceivable fact--it had a curious effect.\nShe should have been indignant, contemptuous of the obtuse creature--as,\nindeed, in a sense, she was--but chiefly she was conscious of a lifted\nweight--of an enormous and hysterical gratitude.\n\nCynthia was a fool--a purblind philistine. But what relief was in her\nfolly, what immense security! Jealousy could not die out in Louise, but\nit entered on a new phase--became passive, enduring resignedly\ninevitable pain. But its vigilance, its fierce pugnacity was dead; for\nCynthia--dear fool--did not care. Pearls had been cast before Americans.\nLouise was ready enough to be gracious to such exquisite insensibility.\nShe became friendly. She had guarded her secret jealousy from the world.\nShe was \"keen\" on Miss Hartill, certainly, but so was half the school,\nat least. She was merely in the fashion. Insignificant and circumspect,\ngiving no confidences, no one but Clare herself, and Alwynne Durand,\nguessed at the intensity of her affection. But with Cynthia Griffiths\nshe was reckless. Ostrich-like, she trusted to the protection of her\nformal disclaimer, while with each new discussion, each half-confidence,\nshe exposed herself and her feelings more completely.\n\nAnd Cynthia, dropping her theories, began to be interested in the\nstrange, vehement imp, with its alternating fits of frankness and\nreticence, wit and childishness, its big brain and its inexplicable yet\nobvious unhappiness. She affected Louise, was accustomed to pet and\nparade her, long before she had solved the problem of her character;\nindeed, it was not until she had confided to the child her plans for an\nearly departure, that Louise relaxed her self-protective vigilance. She\nhad begun, in her walks with Cynthia, to realise the relief and healing\nof self-expression. If Cynthia were going away to Paris, America, never\nto be seen again, what harm in talking--in saying for once what she\nfelt? There was wry pleasure in it, and, oh, what harm?\n\nLouise found an odd satisfaction in leading Cynthia--on her side, if you\nplease, alert for evidence, the amateur detective still--to sit in\njudgment on Clare Hartill; would sit, horrified, thrilled, drinking in\nblasphemy. She would have allowed no other human being to impeach the\nsmallest detail of Clare Hartill's conduct, but from Cynthia, though she\nraged hotly, she did allow, and in some queer fashion, enjoy it. She\nhad, perhaps, a vague assurance that Cynthia, being a foreigner, could\nnot be taken seriously.\n\nSo the pair discussed Clare Hartill from all possible angles till Louise\noccasionally forgot to keep up her elaborate pretence of indifference,\nto insist on its being understood that the discussion was rhadamanthine\nin its impersonality.\n\n\"Yes, I'm off soon,\" Cynthia had confided. They were sitting together in\nher cubicle. \"All this is slow--slow. Ne' mind! Wait till this child\ngets going!\" She stretched herself lazily, and flung back on her little\nwhite bed, arms behind her. Louise studied her magnificent torso.\n\n\"Why did you come?\" she demanded.\n\nCynthia laughed.\n\n\"Italy--France--Deutschland--I'd done everywhere but England. Now comes\na tour round the world--and so home. I'm Californian, you know. I'll\nhave great times then. You don't live, over here. You're afraid of your\nown shadows. Now an American girl----\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Aren't you? Always afraid of breaking rules? Haven't I asked\nyou--haven't I begged you to come out with me one day? Oh, Louise, it\nwould be great! I saw a taxi-man yesterday, outside church, with the\nduckiest eyes! Lunch somewhere, and 'phone through for the new show at\nDaly's. An American show! Dandy! Only taken you four years to transfer\nhere! Let's go, Louise? We'd be back to supper.\"\n\nLouise twinkled.\n\n\"Rot! We'd be expelled.\"\n\nCynthia opened her china-blue eyes.\n\n\"For a little thing like that? Why? We wouldn't miss a class. Besides,\nwe'd say you asked me home to tea.\"\n\nLouise looked distressed. Their ideas of veracity had clashed before.\n\nCynthia, watching mischievously, giggled.\n\n\"Poor kid! Doesn't it want to tell lies, then?\"\n\n\"You see--English people don't! Of course, I know it's different\nabroad,\" said Louise delicately.\n\n\"Haven't you ever, Louise?\"\n\nLouise flushed crimson.\n\n\"You have?\" Cynthia was amused. \"What was it, Louise? Oh, what was it?\nTell! Oh, you needn't mind me--my average is--well, quite average. What\nwas it?\"\n\nLouise's lips closed.\n\n\"I call you the limit, you know! 'English people don't!' With a red-hot\ntarradiddle on your little white conscience all the time. You're a good\npupil, Louise.\"\n\nLouise, blushing, turned suspiciously.\n\n\"What are you at now!\" she demanded.\n\n\"I was thinking of Clarissa.\" Cynthia smiled with intention.\n\n\"Clarissa who?\"\n\n\"Clare, kid! Clare! Sweet Clare! Sugar-sweet Clare! Our dear Dame\nDouble!\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't talk like that,\" said Louise, in her lowest voice.\n\"You know I hate it.\"\n\n\"All right, honey!\" Cynthia rolled lazily on to her side and pulled a\nbox of chocolates from the shelf beside her.\n\nThe room was quiet for a while.\n\n\"Cynthia?\"\n\n\"Um?\"\n\n\"What did you mean just now?\"\n\n\"Have a candy?\"\n\n\"No, thanks!\"\n\nCynthia munched on.\n\n\"About Miss Hartill?\" Louise's tone was half defiant, half guilty. She\nfelt disloyal in re-opening the subject. Yet Cynthia's hints rankled.\n\n\"I don't know. Nothing, I guess.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you did mean something,\" said Louise uneasily.\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"Want to know?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Badly?\"\n\n\"It's not true, of course! But I'd like to know.\"\n\nCynthia's eyes danced. She could be grave enough otherwise, but her eyes\nand her dimples could never be kept in order.\n\n\"Tell about the tarradiddle first, and I will.\"\n\nBut to Louise a lie was a lie and no joking matter. She fidgeted.\n\n\"If you must know----\"\n\n\"I must.\"\n\n\"Well--you know how Miss Hartill hates birthdays?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"At least, school ones. You know, there's such a fuss at Miss\nMarsham's--a holiday, presents, and all that. So Miss Hartill won't let\nhers be known.\"\n\n\"'Splendid Isolation' stunt.\"\n\n\"If you're going to be a hatefully unjust pig, I won't tell you.\"\n\n\"I apologise. Have a candy?\"\n\n\"Well, you know, Agatha found out that Miss Hartill was giving a party\nlast week, and, of course, every one thought it was for hers. But it\nturned out it was Daffy's birthday: Miss Hartill gave it for her. It was\nAgatha's fault. She was so dead certain about it.\"\n\n\"But what did it matter?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, I'd got some roses----\"\n\n\"Pale pink and yellow? Beauties?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oho! So that's where they came from. I did Dame Double an injustice. I\nthought it was a best boy.\" Cynthia gurgled.\n\n\"You saw them?\"\n\n\"I went to tea with her--it must have been that day--the eighth?\"\n\nLouise nodded.\n\n\"A party! Agatha is a coon. There was only Daffy there! I wonder she\ndidn't ask you.\"\n\nLouise said nothing. Her face was expressionless.\n\n\"Mean old thing!\" Cynthia grew indignant as the situation dawned on her.\n\n\"She can't ask every one. There was no reason whatever to ask me.\" But\nLouise's voice had a suspicious quiver in it, which Cynthia, with\nunusual tact, ignored.\n\n\"Well--about the roses? They were beauties, kid!\"\n\n\"Oh, I brought 'em round, going to school. I thought she'd started, but\nshe hadn't. She opened the door. So there I was, stuck.\" Louise began to\nlaugh. \"I'd meant to leave them, just without any name.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Cynthia twinkled.\n\n\"She was rather--rather breakfasty, you know--and I got flustered and\nforgot to wish her 'many happy.' Wasn't it lucky? I was thankful\nafterwards. I only said they were out of the greenhouse and I thought\nshe'd like them. She did, too.\" Louise smiled to herself.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"But where did the lie come in?\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh--well--I'd bought them, you see. As if Mamma would let me pick\nflowers. Besides, we haven't even got a greenhouse. But I had five\nshillings at Christmas, and sixpence in the pudding--and sixpence a week\npocket-money--and I never have anything to buy. I could well afford it,\"\nsaid Louise, with dignity.\n\n\"That's not a lie,\" said Cynthia, disappointed. \"It's barely an--an\nevasion.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to--evade. I was only afraid she'd be cross, and yet I\ncouldn't resist getting them. Do you know the feeling, when you ache to\ngive people things? But it was a lie, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, well! You needn't mind. She tells plenty herself--acts them, at\nleast----\"\n\nLouise caught her up.\n\n\"There! That's it! That's one of the things! You're always hinting\nthings! Why do you? I won't have it! Of course, I know you're only in\nfun, but if anybody hears you----\"\n\n\"I'm not! Oh, but it's no use talking! You think she's a god almighty.\nWhat's the use of my telling you that she's a conceited----\"\n\n\"She's not!\"\n\n\"Oh, she's a right to be. She'd be a peach if I had the dressing of\nher----\"\n\n\"She doesn't like American fashions. We don't want her to. We like her\nas she is.\"\n\n\"And she knows it--you bet your bottom dollar! There's not much she\ndoesn't know. Why, she simply lives for effect! She's the most gorgeous\nhypocrite----\"\n\n\"You're a beastly one yourself--you pretend you like her----\"\n\n\"But I do! I admire her heaps! But I understand her. You don't. She\nlikes to be top dog. She'll do anything for that. She likes to know\nevery woman and child in the school is a bit of putty, to knead into\nshape. I know! I've met her sort before--only generally it was men they\nwere after. And yet it bores her too----\" parenthesised Cynthia\nshrewdly. \"That's why she likes me. I don't care two pins for her\ntricks. That stings her up a bit. She'll be mighty bored when I go.\"\n\nLouise listened, angry, yet fascinated. It gave her a curious pleasure\nto hear Miss Hartill belied. She would hug herself for her own superior\ndiscernment. A phrase from a half-digested story often recurred to her:\n\"One doesn't defend one's god! One's god is a defence in himself.\" But\nCynthia was going too far--abandoning innuendo for direct assault. She\nstruck back.\n\n\"It's easy to say things. Just saying so doesn't make it so. And if it\ndid, I shouldn't believe it.\"\n\n\"Oh! I can prove it.\" Cynthia laughed. \"Have you noticed the Charette\ncomedy?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle? Oh, she hates Miss Hartill. But she's French, of course.\"\n\n\"Does she just? H'm----!\"\n\n\"Well, there was a French girl--she left last term--she told Marion that\nMademoiselle had said things to her about Miss Hartill. Agatha told me.\nAgatha loathes Mademoiselle. Of course, Mademoiselle is rather down on\nher.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. You know how Agatha hazes her in class.\"\n\n\"I can't stand Agatha.\" Louise shook herself. \"Last French Grammar it\nwas awful--silly, you know, not funny. One simply couldn't work.\nMademoiselle kept her in. I suppose Agatha didn't like that. She's been\na lamb since, anyway. About time too!\"\n\n\"Shucks! It wasn't being kept in. It was Clarissa. Oh, my dear, it was\nfun! There was poor little Mademoiselle, storming away in her absurd\nEnglish, and Agatha cheeking her for all she was worth.\"\n\n\"How did you hear?\"\n\n\"Why, I was in the studio! Agatha didn't know we were there, of course.\nThe glass doors were open. You know, Daffy gives me extra drawing. And\njust when Agatha was in full swing, and Mademoiselle speechless with\nrage, Miss Hartill turned up--wanted Daffy.\"\n\n\"Oh, go on!\" Louise cried breathlessly.\n\n\"It really was funny, you know. Miss Hartill was talking to Daffy and\nthe row going on next door--you couldn't help hearing--and suddenly\nDaffy said--Daffy had been fidgeting for some time--'Listen!' and\nClarissa said, 'Oho-o!' You know her way, with about ten o's at the end;\nand Daffy said, 'There! Now do you believe me?' kind of crowing. And\nMiss Hartill, she just smiled, like a cat with cream, and said, 'All\nright, Alwynne! All right, my dear!' and went into the next room. Say,\nit was exciting! She didn't raise her voice, but she just let herself\ngo, and in about two minutes Agatha came out like a ripe\ncheese--literally crawling. I wish she hadn't shut the door. I couldn't\nhear any more. I could see, of course, and you bet I watched out of the\ntail of my eye. Daffy never noticed me.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"Oh! They stood and talked, and Mademoiselle was scarlet and seemed to\nbe pitching into Miss Hartill, as far as I could see, and Miss Hartill\nwas letting her talk herself out, and sometimes she smiled and said\nsomething; that always started Mademoiselle off again. And at last\nMademoiselle went and sat in one of the window-seats, and I couldn't see\nher face, but I imagined she was howling. French people always do.\nClarissa went and patted her shoulder.\"\n\n\"She is a dear!\" Loyally Louise bit back her instant jealousy.\n\n\"Oh, she was enjoying herself,\" said Cynthia coolly. \"You should have\nseen her face. Sort of smiling at her own thoughts. Have you ever seen a\nspider smile?\"\n\nLouise disdained an answer.\n\n\"Nor have I! Have a candy? But I bet I know what it looks like.\"\n\n\"Well, what happened?\" demanded Louise impatiently.\n\n\"Oh, it was annoying! Daffy came and sat down in my place, to correct. I\ncouldn't see any more. Only when Miss Hartill came out (she didn't\nnotice me, I was putting away the group), she said to Daffy, 'She's\ncoming to tea on Friday.' And Daffy said, 'Clare, you're a wonder!' And\nMiss Hartill said, 'I didn't do it for her, Alwynne!' And Daffy got\npink. Clarissa did look pleased with herself.\"\n\n\"Well, so she ought! Wouldn't you be--if you could make people happy?\"\n\nCynthia threw up her hands. \"Happy! Oh, Momma! Are you happy?\"\n\nLouise winced.\n\n\"Is Daffy? Mademoiselle? Any of you fools? Oh, it's no use talking! You\nwon't believe me when I tell you that she's a cat. Yes, a pussy-cat,\nLouise! A silky, purring pussy-cat, pawing you, pat--pat--so softly,\nlike kisses. But if you wriggle--my! Look out for claws! Have a candy?\"\n\nLouise gathered herself together. She came close to the bed, and leaning\nover the older girl, spoke--\n\n\"I don't understand what you're driving at--but you're wrong. It's you\nthat's a fool. You misjudge her, utterly. You don't understand\nher--you're not fit to.\"\n\n\"Are you?\" Cynthia laughed at her openly.\n\n\"Of course not. No one--Daffy does, of course. But us?--girls? Just\nbecause she's been heavenly to you, you take advantage, to watch her, to\njudge, to twist all she says and does. Why do you hate her so?\"\n\n\"I don't.\" Cynthia pulled herself upright. \"My dear, you're wrong there.\nI like her immensely. She's a real treat. But I don't worship her like\nyou do.\"\n\n\"I don't! I--I just love her.\" Louise glowed.\n\nCynthia laughed jollily.\n\n\"Oh, well! You'll get over that. Wait till you get a best boy.\"\n\n\"If you think I'd look at any silly man, after knowing her----\"\n\n\"My dear girl! Has it never occurred to you that you'll marry some day?\"\n\nLouise shook her head.\n\n\"I've thought it all out. I never could love anybody as much as I do\nMiss Hartill. I know I couldn't.\"\n\n\"But it's not the same! Falling in love with a man----\"\n\n\"Love's love,\" said Louise with finality. \"Where's the difference?\"\n\nCynthia sat up.\n\n\"Where's the difference? Where's the----?\" She giggled. But something in\nthe quality of her laughter disturbed. Louise frowned.\n\n\"I didn't say anything funny. You'll love your husband, I suppose, that\nyou're always talking about having--and I'll stick to Miss Hartill. It's\nperfectly simple.\"\n\nBut Cynthia was still laughing. Louise grew irritable under her amused\nglances, and would have turned away, but Cynthia flung her arm about\nher.\n\n\"Stop! Don't you really know?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The difference.\"\n\nCynthia's eyes shone oddly. Louise moved uneasily, disconcerted by their\nexpression.\n\nCynthia continued.\n\n\"Hasn't any one told you? Why, with the books you've read----Haven't\nyou read the Bible ever?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Louise was indignant. \"I've been right through--four\ntimes.\"\n\n\"And you've never noticed? Good Lord! That's all I read it for.\"\n\n\"I haven't an idea what you're driving at,\" said Louise. Cynthia was\nmaking her thoroughly uncomfortable.\n\nCynthia was flushed, laughing, pure devilry in her eyes. Her lips were\npouted, her little teeth gleamed. She looked a child licking its lips\nover forbidden dainties. She had pulled Louise into her lap and her\nvoice had dropped to a whisper.\n\n\"Shall I tell you? Would you like to know? You ought to--you're\nfourteen--it's absurd--not knowing about things--shall I tell you?\"\n\nLouise fidgeted. Cynthia's manner had aroused her curiosity, but none\nthe less she was repelled. Why, she could not have said. She hesitated,\naroused, yet half frightened.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Cynthia lusciously.\n\nWith a sudden effort Louise freed herself from the encircling arm. She\nedged away from the elder girl, stammering a little.\n\n\"I don't think I want to know anything. It's awfully sweet of you. I'd\nrather--I always ask Daffy things. Do you mind?\"\n\nCynthia, good-tempered as ever, laughed aloud.\n\n\"Lord, no! But what a little saint! Aren't you ever curious, Louise? All\nright! I won't tease. Have a candy?\"\n\nAnd Louise, eating chocolates, was not long in forgetting the\nconversation and all the curious discomfort it had aroused. If a leaf\nhad fallen on the white garment of her innocence--a leaf from the tree\nof the knowledge of good and evil--she had brushed it aside, all\nunconscious, before it could leave a stain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nThe spring term was nearly over, holidays and a trip to Italy\ndeliciously near; yet Clare Hartill sat at breakfast and frowned over a\nneatly-written letter.\n\nClare Hartill did not encourage the re-entry of old friends into her\nlife. She did not forget them. She would look back upon the far-off\nflaming intimacy with regret, would quote its pleasures to the friend of\nthe hour with disconcerting enthusiasm; but she was never eager for the\nreappearance of any whose ways had once diverged from her own. Pleasant\nmemories, if you will; but, in the flesh, old friends were tiresome.\nThey claimed instant intimacy; were free-tongued, fond, familiar; could\nnot realise that though they might choose to stand still, she, Clare,\nhad grown out of their knowledge, beyond their fellowship. She, indeed,\nwould find them terribly unaltered; older, glamourless, yet amazingly,\nhumiliatingly the same. She would look at them furtively as she\nentertained them, and shudder at the lapse from taste that surely must\nhave explained her former affection. She would be gracious, kind, yet\ninimitably distant, and would send them away at last, subdued, vaguely\ndisquieted, loyal still, yet very sure that they would never trouble her\nagain. Which was exactly what Clare Hartill intended. Yet she had her\nfits of remorse withal, her secret bitter railing at fate and her own\nnature, for that she could neither keep a friend nor live without one.\nRecovering, she would be complacent at having contrived, without loss of\nprestige, to rid herself of bores.\n\nThere was one fly in her ointment. Who knows not that fly, earnest and\nwell-intentioned, which, when it is dug out with a hairpin, cleanses\nitself exhaustively and forthwith returns to the vaseline jar? Such a\nfly, optimistic and persistent, was the correspondent who invariably\nsigned herself, \"Ever, dear Clare, your affectionate little friend,\nOlivia Pring. P.S. Do you remember...?\" There would follow a\nreminiscence, at least twenty years old, that Clare never did remember.\n\nOlivia Pring was a school-mate. There had been a term together in the\nLower Third. For a few weeks she had been Clare's best friend and she\nnever let Clare forget it. Clare, with removes and double removes, had\ndisappeared speedily from Olivia's world, but she never quite shook off\nOlivia. Olivia, amiable, admiring, impervious to snubs, refused to be\nshaken off. She went her placid way, became a governess, and an expert\nin the more complicated forms of crochet. She wrote to Clare about twice\na year--dull, affectionate letters. Clare, that involute character,\namazed herself by invariably answering them. At long intervals Olivia\nwould be passing through London, and would announce herself, if quite\nconvenient, as intending to visit her dear Clare that afternoon. She\nwould describe the lengthy tussle between herself and her employer,\nbefore she had wrested the requisite permission to stay the night--and\ndid Clare remember the last visit but three, and the amusing evening\nthey had had? And the letter was invariably delayed in the posting, and\nits arrival would precede that of Olivia by a bare half-hour. Olivia,\ngrowing even fatter and more placid, would apologise breathlessly\nbetween broad smiles at the sight of Clare and recollections of the dear\nold days. And Clare, as one hypnotised, would go to her linen cupboard\nand give out sheets for the spare room. There would follow an evening of\ninterminable small-talk for Clare, of sheer delight for Olivia Pring,\nwho, consciously and conscientiously commonplace, enjoyed dear Clare's\ndaring views as a youthful curate might enjoy, strictly as an onlooker,\nwhat he imagines to be the less respectable aspects of an evening in\nParis.\n\nAnd Clare would retire to bed at ten-fifteen and sleep as she had not\nslept for weeks. Olivia would be regretfully obliged to catch the\neight-eleven, and would depart amid embraces. And Clare would order up a\nsecond breakfast and wonder why she stood it. Yet the pile of unused\ndoileys in her linen cupboard increased yearly. A doiley was Olivia's\ninvariable tribute, and arrived, intricate and unlovely, within a week\nof her visit.\n\nClare fingered her letter in quaint helplessness. She had a sleepless\nnight behind her, and a big morning's work before, and her usual\nend-of-term headache. Olivia was arriving--she glanced at the hopelessly\nlegible sheets--at three-fifty. No chance of mistake there. Clare\ndecided that it was quite impossible for her to survive a seven hours'\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with her affectionate friend Olivia Pring. If only Alwynne\ncould help her out. But Alwynne, she knew, was taking the skimmings of\nthe Sixths and Fifths to a suitable Shakespeare performance. She had\ntaken the pick of the classes herself the evening before. No chance of\nAlwynne, then. And Cynthia! Alack for Cynthia! who could have been\ntrusted to amuse Olivia Pring as much as Olivia Pring would have amused\nher--Cynthia must be aboard ship by now. Clare, in regretful\nparenthesis, hoped Cynthia would send a few compatriots to\nUtterbridge.... Americans gave a fillip to one's duties.... Anyhow\nAlwynne and Cynthia were out of the question.\n\nThere was Louise! She brightened. Louise, queer little thing, was always\namusing.... Louise would serve her turn.... Louise would be so charmed\nto come.... Clare laughed a little consciously. Perhaps she had\nneglected Louise a trifle of late, perhaps it was not altogether fair of\nher. A happy thought buffered the prick of her yawning conscience. It\nwas Alwynne's fault.... Alwynne, with her ridiculous, well-meaning\nobjections.... She, Clare, had given in to them, for peace and quiet\nsake.... And now, most probably, Louise was not too content with\nlife.... One knew what schoolgirls were.... Never mind! Clare would be\nvery nice to Louise this evening.... Louise should enjoy herself, and,\nincidentally, preserve Clare from expiring of boredom at poor Olivia's\nlarge, flat feet.\n\nThe invitation was given during the eleven o'clock break. Clare would\noccasionally join the school in Big Hall, and share its milk and\nbiscuits. Often enough to make it any day's delightful possibility, not\noften enough for it to be other than an event. She would sit on the\nplatform steps, watching the gay promenaders below, informal,\napproachable, tossing the ball to the daring few, hedged about, in turn,\nby the tentative many. Sometimes she would stroll about the hall with a\ngirl on either side, or one only. She had a curious little trick of\ncatching the girl she spoke with by the elbow, and pushing her gently\nalong as she talked, bending over (she was very tall) and enveloping.\nEverybody knew the \"Gendarme Stunt\" as Cynthia Griffiths irreverently\ntermed it, and no one would have dreamed of approaching or interrupting\nsuch a _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_.\n\nNevertheless, Miss Hartill had not exchanged three sentences with Louise\nDenny on the morning of Olivia Pring's arrival, before every girl in Big\nHall knew of it, and twice the number of eyes were following them, with\nan elaborately accidental gaze, in their progress.\n\nPossibly Clare was a little touched by Louise's delight at the\ninvitation. At any rate she managed, in spite of her headache, to be a\nvery charming companion. She confessed to the headache, and asked Louise\nfor advice. And Louise, deeply concerned, could think of nothing but a\nrecipe she had found in Clare's own Culpeper, in which rhubarb and\npowdered dormice figured largely. She suggested it in a doubtful little\nvoice. The school would have given a good deal to know what made Miss\nHartill laugh so.\n\nMiss Hartill told Louise all about her visitor, whom, she declared, she\ndepended on Louise to entertain, and added a couple of comical tales of\ntheir mutual schooldays. Unfortunately Clare's _novelli_ owed their\ncharm more to her inventive touches and graphic manner than to the\nactual underlying fact. Louise was left with the impression of an\nOlivia Pring who had been Friar Tuck to Clare's Robin Hood. She\nappreciated the honour of being asked to meet her to a degree that would\nhave tickled Clare, had she guessed it.\n\n\"Miss Olivia Pring!\" Louise meditated all day over Miss Olivia Pring.\nEvidently Miss Hartill's best friend.... She hoped Miss Olivia Pring\nwould like her.... How dreadful it would be if she didn't ... for what\nmight she not say of her to Miss Hartill? Louise must be careful, oh, so\ncareful, of her manners and her speech.... It was rather hard luck that\nshe would not have Miss Hartill to herself.... It would be dreadfully\nuncomfortable--talking before a stranger.... Except for the\ndelightfulness of being asked by Miss Hartill, she could have wished\nthat Miss Hartill had not asked her. Rather an ordeal for a\nthirteen-year-old--supper with Miss Hartill and Miss Olivia Pring.\n\nNow shyness, like any other painful sensation, is inexplicable to such\nas have not experienced it, is at once forgotten by such as outgrow it,\nbut to those at its mercy, to sheer suffering, paralysing, stultifying,\na spiritual Torture of the Pear.\n\nClare Hartill should have understood; she had her own furtive childhood\nfor reference; but Clare Hartill had a headache, and she was very tired\nof Olivia Pring. Olivia was so placid, so shapeless, so ridiculous, in\nher pink flannel blouse, and the reckless glasses, that were ever on the\npoint of toppling over the precipice of her abbreviated nose into the\nabyss of her half-open mouth. It certainly did not occur to Clare that\nLouise could feel the slightest discomfort on account of Olivia Pring.\n\nBut Louise was blind to the flannel blouse, and the foolish face, and\nthe unmanageable glasses. She was wearing glasses of her own,\nrose-coloured affairs, through which Miss Pring appeared, not only as a\n\"grown-up\" and a stranger, but as the intimate of Deity in Undress.\nMiss Pring did nothing to dispel the illusion--she had conscientiously\nflattened the high spirits out of too many little girls to be interested\nin a new specimen. She addressed herself chiefly to Clare--recalling\nincessantly, and enlarging upon, trifling incidents of their mutual\npast, which every fresh sentence of the badgered hostess contrived to\nrecall to her elastic memory. Louise, always sensitive, her shyness\ngrowing with every word, could but take each unexplained allusion as a\npersonal snub, and feeling herself entirely superfluous, began to\nimagine that Miss Hartill was already regretting the invitation.\nPanic-struck she tried to remedy matters by effacing herself as\ncompletely as possible. It was wonderful what a small and insignificant\nperson Louise could sometimes look, and did look that evening in one of\nClare's big arm-chairs. Her prim little whisper and deprecatory smile\nmight have struck Clare as pathetic if Clare had not been so very tired\nof the affectionate reminiscences of Olivia Pring. As it was, she was\nannoyed. She had asked Louise of the bright eyes and quick stammer and\nextravagant imagery, to supper with her--the panther-cub, not the\nleveret. She had talked of Louise too--had looked forward to putting the\nchild through its paces, if only for the benefit of Olivia Pring. She\nhad even surmised that Louise would take Olivia's measure, and at a nod\nfrom Clare would be delicately, deliciously impertinent. Indeed, she had\nthought her capable of it. But it was only a schoolgirl after all--a\nsilly tongue-tied schoolgirl--that she had for an instant compared with\nAlwynne: Alwynne, monstrously absent, a match for ten Olivias.\n\nShe yawned, shrugged her shoulders, and suggested, in fine ironic fit, a\ngame of \"Old Maid.\" Olivia was extremely pleased. She so much preferred\nOld Maid--or Beggar-my-Neighbour, perhaps?--to Bridge. She did not\napprove of Bridge. In her position it did not do. Clare would remember\nthat she had always said....\n\nClare fetched the cards.\n\nLouise! Louise! You have done yourself no good to-night. Shy? Nonsense!\nWhat is there to be shy about? A few words from Miss Hartill--a\nprompting or two--a leading question--could have broken the ice of your\nshyness for you, eh? And Miss Hartill knows it, as well as you, if not\nbetter. That shall not avail you. Who are you, to set Miss Hartill's\nconscience itching? Miss Hartill has a headache. Pull up your chair, and\ndeal your cards, and stop Miss Hartill yawning, if you can. Believe me,\nit's your only chance of escape.\n\nLouise was a clumsy dealer. Her careful setting out of cards irritated\nClare to snatching point. Olive triumphed in every game. On principle,\nClare disliked losing, even at Beggar-my-Neighbour. And they played\nBeggar-my-Neighbour till ten o'clock.\n\nLouise grew more cheerful as the evening progressed, ventured a few\nsentences now and then. Clare was dangerously suave with both her\nguests; but Louise, taking all in good faith, hoped after all, that she\nhad not appeared as stupid as she felt. It had been dreadful at first,\nshe reflected, as she put on coat and hat. But it had gone better\nafterwards.... She didn't believe Miss Hartill was cross with her....\nThat had been a silly idea of her own.... Miss Hartill was just as\nusual.\n\nShe made her farewells. Clare came out into the hall and ushered her\nforth.\n\n\"Good-bye!\" Louise smiled up at her. \"It was so kind of you to have me.\nI have so much enjoyed myself.\" Then, the formula off her tongue: \"Miss\nHartill, I do hope your head's better?\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Clare inscrutably. \"Good-night!\" Then, as the maid\nwent down the stairs: \"Louise!\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Hartill?\"\n\nClare was smiling brilliantly.\n\n\"Don't come again, Louise, until you can be more amusing. At any rate,\nnatural. Good-night!\"\n\nShe shut the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nLouise spent her Easter holidays among her lesson books. Miss Hartill\nand Miss Durand were in Italy, all responsibilities put aside for four\nblessed weeks, but for Louise there could be no relaxation. The\nexaminations were to take place a few days before the summer term began,\nand their imminence overshadowed her. Useless for Miss Durand to extract\na promise to rest, to be lazy, to forget all about lessons. Louise\npromised readily and broke her promise half-an-hour after she had waved\nthe train out of the station. Impossible to keep away from one's History\nand Latin and Mathematics with examinations three weeks ahead. Miss\nDurand might preach; her overtaxed brain cry pax; her cramped body ache\nfor exercise; but Louise knew herself forced to ignore all protests. She\nwould rest when the examinations were over. Till then--revision,\nrepetition--repetition, revision--with as little time as might be\ngrudged to eating and sleeping and duty walks with Mrs. Denny.\n\nThere was no time to lose. The nights swallowed up the days all too\nswiftly.\n\nYet, waking one morning with a start to realise that the day of days had\ndawned at last, she found it incredible. The morning was exactly like\nother mornings, with the sun streaming blindingly in upon her, because\nshe had forgotten, as usual, to drawn her blind at night, her head\nalready aching a little, hot and heavy from uneasy sleep. All night long\nher brain had been alert, restless, beyond control. All night long it\nhad tugged and fretted, like a leashed dog, at the surface slumber that\ntethered it. She felt confused, burdened with a half-consciousness of\nvivid, forgotten dreams.\n\nShe dressed abstractedly, lesson books propped against her\nlooking-glass, and wedged between soap-dish and pitcher. For the\nhundredth time she conned the technicalities of her work, and making no\nslips, grew more cheerful for it had been the letter, not the spirit,\nthat had troubled her--little matters of rules and exceptions, of dates\nand derivations, that would surely trip her up. But she was feeling sure\nof herself at last, and thrilling as she was with nervous excitement,\ncould yet be glad that the great day had dawned, and ready to laugh at\nall her previous despondencies. Things were turning out better than she\nhad expected. There was bracing comfort in beginning with her own\nsubject--Miss Hartill's own subject. She could have no fears for herself\nin the Literature examination. French in the afternoon, that was less\npleasant. But she would manage--must, literally. \"Miss Hartill\nexpects----\" She laughed. She supposed the sailors felt just the same\nabout Nelson as she did about Miss Hartill. She wondered if Lady\nHamilton had minded his only having one eye and one arm? Suppose Miss\nHartill had only one eye and one arm? Oh! If anything happened to Miss\nHartill...! She shivered at the idea and instantly witnessed, with all\nimaginable detail, the wreck of the train as it entered Utterbridge\nstation, and she herself rescuing Miss Hartill, armless and blind, from\nthe blazing carriage. She had her on the sofa, five years later, in the\nprettiest of invalid gowns, contentedly reliant on her former pupil. And\nLouise, blissfully happy, was her hands and feet and eyes, her nurse,\nher servant, her--(hastily Louise deprived her alike of income and\nfriends) her bread-winner and companion. Here her French Grammar,\nslithering over the soap to the floor, woke her from that delicious\nreverie.\n\nShe picked it up, and applied herself for a while to its dazing\ninfinitives. But teeth-brushing is a rhythmic process: her thoughts\nwandered again perforce. She had got to be first.... Miss Hartill would\nbe so pleased.... It would be heavenly to please Miss Hartill again as\nshe used to do.... Nothing had been the same since Cynthia came.... She\nflushed to the eyes at the recollection of her last unlucky\nvisit----\"You needn't come again unless you can be more amusing. You\nmight at least be natural....\" Yet Miss Hartill had been so kind at the\nlast ... had waved to her from the train....\n\nThe postman's knock startled her, disturbed her meditations anew.\nLetters! Was it possible? Would Miss Hartill have remembered? Have sent\nher, perhaps, a postcard? Stranger things had been. She had for weeks\nenvisaged the possibility. She finished her dressing and tore\ndownstairs.\n\nThe maid was hovering over the breakfast-table.\n\n\"Are there any letters, Baxter? Are there any letters?\" But she had\nalready caught sight of a foreign postcard on her plate, a postcard with\nan unfamiliar stamp. She scurried round the table, her heart thumping.\n\nBut the big, adventurous handwriting was hatefully familiar. The\npostcard was from Miss Durand.\n\nShe waited a moment, her lips parted vacantly, as was her fashion when\ncontrolling emotion; waited till the maid had gone.\n\nThen she crumpled and tore the thin cardboard in her hand and flung it\nat last on the floor, in a passion of disappointment.\n\n\"She might have written!\" cried Louise. \"Oh, she might have written! It\nwouldn't have hurt her--a postcard.\"\n\nPresently a thought struck her. She groped under the table for the torn\nscraps of paper and spread them in her lap, piecing them eagerly,\nlaboriously. Miss Hartill might have written on Miss Durand's postcard.\n\nShe had the oblong fitted together at last and read the scrawl with\nimpatient eagerness. Miss Durand was just sending her a line to wish her\nall imaginable luck. She and Miss Hartill were having a glorious time.\nThey were sitting at that moment where she had made a cross on the\npicture postcard. She wished Louise could be with them to see the\nwonderful view over the valley and with good wishes from them both, was\nher Alwynne Durand....\n\nLouise's eyes softened--\"from them both.\" That was something! Miss\nHartill had sent her a message. She sighed as she wrapped the scraps\ncarefully in her handkerchief. Life was queer.... Here was Miss Durand,\nso kind, so friendly always--yet her kindness brought no pleasure....\nAnd Miss Hartill, who could open heaven with a word--was not half so\nkind as Miss Durand. Louise marvelled that Miss Hartill could be so\nmiserly. She was sure that if she, Louise, could make people utterly\nhappy by kind looks and kind words, stray messages and occasional\npostcards, that she would be only too glad to be allowed to do it. To\npossess the power of giving happiness.... And with no more trouble to\nyourself than the writing of a postcard! Queer that Miss Hartill did not\nrealise what her mere existence meant to people.... She couldn't realise\nit, of course ... that was it.... She thought so little about\nherself.... It was her own beautiful selflessness that made her seem,\noccasionally, hard--unkind even.... She didn't realise what she meant to\npeople.... If she had, she would have written.... Of course she would\nhave written ... just a word ... on Daffy's postcard....\n\nLouise sighed again. One didn't ask much.... But it seemed the more\nhumble one grew--the less one asked--the more unlikely people were to\nthrow one even that little.... At any rate there was the examination to\ntackle.... If she did well--! She lost herself again in speculations as\nto the form Miss Hartill's approval might take.\n\nThe family trooped in to breakfast as the brisk maid dumped a steaming\ndishful of liver and bacon upon the table.\n\nLouise occupied her place and began to spread her bread-and-butter,\navoiding her father's eye. But, as she foresaw, she was not permitted to\nescape.\n\nMr. Denny pounced upon the butter-dish.\n\n\"Not with bacon,\" he remarked, with reproachful satisfaction, and\nremoved it.\n\nLouise said nothing. She was careful not to look at her parent, for she\nknew that her expression was not permissible. His harmless tyrannies\nirritated her as invariably as her tricks of personality grated upon\nhim. She thought him smug and petty, and despised him for his submissive\nattitude to her step-mother. His noisy interferences with her personal\nhabits she thought intolerable, though she had learned to endure them\nstolidly. But most of all, she hated to see his fat, pudgy hands\ntouching her food. She was accustomed to cut bread for the family. No\none guessed why she had arrogated to herself that duty.\n\nAnd he, good man, would look at his daughter occasionally, and wonder\nwhy she was so unlike his satisfactory sons and their capable mother:\nwould be vaguely annoyed by her silences, and by a certain expression\nthat reminded him uncomfortably of his first \"fine-lady\" wife; would\nhave an emotion of disquieted responsibility; would hesitate: would end\nby presenting his daughter with a five-shilling-piece, or be delivered\nfrom a dawning sense of responsibility by crumbs on the carpet, the\nmuddy boots of a son and heir, or, as in the present instance, an\nunjustifiable predilection for butter.\n\n\"Bread with your meat,\" he said firmly and handed her a full plate.\n\nThen he watched her with interest. His conception of the duties of\nfatherhood was realised in seeing that his children slightly over-ate\nthemselves at every meal. He did as he would be done by.\n\nLouise picked up knife and fork unwillingly. She was dry-mouthed with\nexcitement and the beginnings of a headache, and the liberal portion of\nhot, rich food sickened her. But anything was better than a fuss. She\nsliced idly at the slab of liver.\n\nOpportunity beckoned Mr. Denny.\n\n\"Don't play with your food,\" said the father sharply.\n\nShe ate a few mouthfuls, conscious of his supervision. Satisfied, he\nturned at last to his own breakfast.\n\nThere was a peaceful interval.\n\nThe children talked among themselves. Mrs. Denny, hidden behind her\ntea-cosy, was exclusively concerned with the table manners of the\nyoungest boy. The moment was propitious.\n\nSoftly Louise rose and slipped to the sideboard. Her plate once hidden\nbehind the biscuit-tin....\n\nMr. Denny looked up. He was ever miraculously alert at breakfast.\n\n\"More bacon, Louise?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Father,\" said Louise fervently.\n\n\"Have you finished your plate?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\"\n\nHer brothers gave tongue joyously.\n\n\"Oh-h! You whopper!\"\n\n\"Oh, Father, she hasn't!\"\n\n\"Mother, did you hear? Louise says she's finished her bacon. She\nhasn't.\"\n\n\"Not near!\"\n\n\"Not half!\"\n\n\"Not a quarter!\"\n\n\"Well--of all the whopping lies!\"\n\nMr. Denny sprang up, his eyes glistening. He, too, enjoyed a scene. The\nplate was retrieved from its hiding-place and its guilty burden laid\nbare.\n\n\"Emma, do you see this? Emma! Leave that child alone and attend to me!\nFlagrant! Flagrant disobedience! Louise, I told you to eat it. Turning\nup your nose at good food! There's many a child would be thankful--Emma!\nAm I to be disobeyed by my own children? And a lie into the bargain! If\nthat is the way you are taught at your fine school, I'll take you away.\nDisgraceful! Eat it up now. Emma! Are you or are you not going to back\nme up? Is all that food to be wasted?\"\n\nMrs. Denny's calm eyes surveyed the excited table.\n\n\"Don't fuss, Edwin. Louise, eat up your bacon.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Louise sullenly.\n\n\"Then you shouldn't have taken so much.\"\n\n\"I didn't. It was Father----\"\n\n\"Eat it up at once,\" said Mrs. Denny peremptorily, as the baby cast his\nspoon upon the carpet. The tone of her voice ended the discussion.\n\nMr. Denny watched his daughter triumphantly, as she toiled over her\ntask, called her attention to a piece of bacon she had left on the edge\nof her plate, and when she had finished told her she was a good girl and\nthat it would do her good. After which he gave her a shilling.\n\n\"I don't want it,\" muttered Louise.\n\n\"You don't want it?\" repeated Mr. Denny incredulously.\n\nLouise looked at him. There was a world of uncomprehending contempt in\nthe eyes of father and child alike, though the father's were amused,\nwhere the child's were bitter.\n\nMr. Denny laughed jollily.\n\n\"I say, kids! Hear that? Your sister here hasn't any use for a shilling.\nBet you haven't either! Eh? I don't think!\"\n\nEnsued clamour, with jostling and laughter and clutching of coins, from\nwhich the head of the house retired to his chair by the fire, chuckling\nand content. He enjoyed distributing largesse, especially where there\nwas no great need for it, though he was liberal enough to famous\ncharities. He never gave to beggars, on principle.\n\nLouise slipped out of the room under cover of the noise, and was dressed\nand departing when her step-mother called her back.\n\n\"Louise! You stay to lunch to-day, don't you?\"\n\n\"At school? Oh no, Mamma. Holidays, you know! They only open a\nclass-room for the exam.\"\n\n\"The fifty-pound job, eh?\" Her father eyed her over the top of his\npaper approvingly. For once his daughter was showing a proper spirit.\n\"Go in and win, my girl! I've given you the best education money could\nbuy. If you don't get it, you jolly well ought to. Fifty quid, eh? I\nwasn't given the chance of earning fifty quid when I was thirteen.\nShop-boy, I was. Started as shop-boy like me father before me.\"\n\nHis wife cut in sharply.\n\n\"Isn't there an afternoon examination? I understood----\"\n\n\"Yes, Mamma. But no dinners. It's all shut.\"\n\nMrs. Denny frowned.\n\n\"It's annoying. I wanted you out of the way. Nurse is taking the\nchildren for an outing. I've enough to do without providing lunches--you\nmust take some sandwiches--spring cleaning--maids all busy----\"\n\n\"I'd rather take sandwiches!\" Louise's face brightened.\n\n\"I thought the cleaning was over--not a comfortable room in the house\nfor the last fortnight.\" Mr. Denny was testy.\n\nHis wife answered them thickly, her mouth full of pins as she adjusted\nher dusting apron.\n\n\"Very well! Ask cook to--no, she's upstairs. Cut them yourself. There's\nplenty of liver. Perfectly absurd! Do you want the house a foot deep in\ndust? You leave the household arrangements to me! The top-floor hasn't\nbeen done for years--not thoroughly.\"\n\n\"The top floor? Not the attics?\" said Louise.\n\n\"Yes! I'm re-arranging the rooms. John's getting too big for the\nnursery. He needs a room to himself. I'm putting him in cook's old\nroom.\"\n\nLouise paused, the slice of bread half cut.\n\n\"Where's cook going?\" said her father.\n\nShe awaited the answer, a fear catching at her breath.\n\n\"Oh, in the lumber-room,\" said Mrs. Denny easily. \"It only wants\npapering. A nice, big room! A sloping roof, of course. But with her\nwages, if she can't put up with a sloping roof--! But it'll take some\nclearing! You wouldn't believe what an amount of rubbish has collected.\"\n\n\"It's not rubbish,\" said Louise. Her voice was low with passion. \"It's\nnot rubbish! You shan't touch it.\"\n\nMrs. Denny spun round amazedly: Her step-daughter, the loaf clutched to\nher breast with an unconscious gesture, the big knife gleaming, was a\ntragi-comic figure.\n\n\"What on earth----?\" she began.\n\nLouise leaned forward, hot-eyed.\n\n\"Mamma! You won't! You can't! You mustn't! Father, don't let her! That's\nMother's room! If you put cook in Mother's room----\" She choked. A\npriestess defending her altars could have used her accents.\n\nMr. Denny put down his paper.\n\n\"What's the matter with the girl?\" he demanded.\n\nMrs. Denny shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"I've no idea! I don't know what she means. Put down that knife;\nLouise--you'll cut yourself. And mind your own business, please.\"\n\n\"You don't understand!\" Louise fought for calmness, for words that\nshould enlighten and persuade. \"I didn't mean to interfere. But the big\nattic! Mamma! Father! That's my room. I always go there--do my lessons\nthere--I love it! You don't know how I love it. You see----\" She paused\nhelplessly.\n\n\"But you've got the nursery to sit in,\" said Mrs. Denny, equally\nhelpless. \"I'm sorry, Louise, if you've taken a fancy to the room--but I\nwant it for cook.\"\n\nLouise made her way to the hearth and stood between the pair.\n\n\"Mamma--please! Please! Please! There's the other attic for cook--not\nthis one!\"\n\n\"Now be quiet, Louise!\" Mrs. Denny was getting impatient.\n\nSuddenly Louise lost grip of herself.\n\n\"It's not right! It's not right! You've got all the house! Every room\nis yours and you grudge me that one! Nobody's ever wanted it but me!\nIt's mine! You've got your lovely rooms--drawing-room, and dining-room,\nand morning-room, and bedroom, and summerhouse, and the boys have got\nthe nursery and the maids have got the kitchen, and yet you won't let me\nhave the attic! It's not fair! It's mean! Why can't cook have the other\nattic? Not this one! Not this one!\"\n\n\"But why? Why?\" Mrs. Denny was more bewildered than angry. She looked\ndown at her step-daughter as a St. Bernard looks at an aggressive\nkitten. Desperately Louise tore off her veils.\n\n\"Because of Mother. Can't you understand? All her things are there.\nShe's there! So I've always played up there. Oh, won't you understand?\"\n\nMrs. Denny flushed.\n\n\"You talk a lot of nonsense, Louise. Finish your sandwiches. You'll be\nlate.\"\n\n\"Then you will leave it, as it is?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I told you--I need it for cook.\"\n\nLouise turned to her father with a frenzied gesture.\n\n\"Father! Don't let her! Don't let her touch it! Oh, how can you let her\ntouch it?\"\n\nMr. Denny put down his paper, staring from one to the other.\n\n\"Emma? What's she driving at?\"\n\n\"To control the household, apparently. She's a very impertinent child,\"\nsaid Mrs. Denny impatiently.\n\n\"Father! I'm not! I don't! Father! I only want her to leave my attic\nalone! Father----\"\n\n\"Don't worry your father now,\" began Mrs. Denny.\n\n\"He's my father! I can speak to him if I choose,\" cried Louise shrilly.\n\n\"Now then, now then!\" reasoned Mr. Denny heavily. \"Can't have you rude\nto your mother, you know.\"\n\nLouise gave herself up to her passion.\n\n\"She's not my mother! I call her Mamma! She's not my mother! Mother\nwouldn't be so cruel! To take away all I've got like that. Her books are\nthere! Her things! It's always been our room--hers and mine! And to take\nit away! To put cook--it's horrible! It's wicked! It's stealing! I hate\nher! I hate you--all of you! I'll never forget--never--never--never!\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly on a high note, stared blindly at the outraged\ncountenances that opposed her, and fled from the room.\n\nThey listened to the clatter of umbrellas in the hall stand, to the\nfurious hands fumbling for mackintosh and satchel, to the bang of the\nhall door.\n\nMr. Denny whistled.\n\n\"Hot stuff! What? I never knew she had it in her.\" There was a curious\nelement of approval in his tone. He respected volubility.\n\nHis wife frowned; then, she, too, began to laugh. She was as incapable\nas he of imagining the state of nerves that could lead, in Louise, to\nsuch an outburst. To speak one's mind, noisily and emphatically, was a\ndaily occurrence for her. Silence was stupidity, and meekness\nirritating. This \"row\" was unusual because Louise had taken part in it,\nbut she certainly thought no worse of her step-daughter on that account.\nThe child should be sent to bed early as a punishment, she decided, but\ngood-humouredly enough. She was too thick-skinned to be pricked by\nLouise's repudiation. She dismissed it as \"temper.\" Its underlying\ncriticism of her character escaped her utterly.\n\nBy the time the attic was cleared and the paperhanger at work, she had\nforgotten the matter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nIt is not impossible to sympathise with Ahab.\n\nIt must have been difficult for him, with his varied possessions, to\nrealise the value to Naboth of his vineyard. He had offered\ncompensation. Naboth would undoubtedly have gained by the exchange.\nAhab, owning half Palestine, must have been genuinely puzzled by this\nblind attachment to one miserable half-acre. One wonders what would have\nhappened if they had met to talk over the matter. Ahab, convinced of the\ngenerosity of his offer, courteously argumentative, carefully repressing\nhis not unnatural impatience, would have contrasted favourably with the\npeasant, black, fierce, dumb, incapable of explaining himself, conscious\nonly of his own bitter helplessness in the face of oppression and loss.\n\nThe Naboth mood is a dangerous one. Fierce emotions, unable to disperse\nthemselves in speech, can turn in again upon the mind that bred them, to\nwork strange havoc. The affair of the attic, outwardly so trivial, shook\nthe child's nature to its foundation. Though one's house be built of\ncards, it is none the less bedazing to have it knocked about one's ears.\nTo Louise, the loss of her holy place, but yet more the manner of its\nloss, was catastrophic. Her nerves, frayed and strained by weeks of\noverwork and excitement, snapped under the shock. Her sense of\nproportion failed her. Miss Hartill, the examination, all that made up\nher life, faded before this monstrous desecration of an ideal. She\nsuffered as Naboth, forgetting also his greater goods of life and kith\nand kin, suffered before her.\n\nBefore she reached the school the violence of her emotion had faded, and\nshe was in the first stage of the inevitable physical reaction. She felt\nweak and shaken. She was going, she knew, to her examination. She\nwondered idly why she did not feel nervous. She tried to impress the\nimportance of the occasion upon herself, but her thoughts eluded\nher--sequence had become impossible. She gave up the attempt, and her\nmind, released, returned to the scene of the morning in incessant,\nmiserable rehearsal.\n\nMechanically she made her way into the school by the unfamiliar\nmistresses' entrance, greeted the little knot of competitors assembled\nin the hall. But if she were introspective and distraught, so were they:\nher silence was unnoticed.\n\nThe nervous minutes passed jerkily. Louise thought that the clock must\nbe enjoying himself. He was playing overseer; he wheezed and grunted as\nher father did at breakfast; had just such a bland, fat face. Her father\nwould be a fat, horrible old man in another ten years. She was glad.\nEvery one would hate him, then, as she hated him, show it as she dared\nnot do.\n\nMiss Vigers interrupted her meditations; Miss Vigers, utterly unreal in\nholiday smiles and the first hobble-skirt in which her decent limbs had\npermitted themselves to be outlined. She marshalled the procession.\n\nThe Lower Fifth class-room, newly scrubbed and reeking of naphthaline,\nwith naked shelves and treble range of isolated desks, was unfamiliar,\ncuriously disconcerting. Louise, ever perilously susceptible to outward\nconditions, was dismayed by the lack of atmosphere. She wriggled\nuneasily in her desk. It was uncomfortable, far too big for her:\nAgatha's initials, of an inkiness that had defied the charwoman, stared\nat her from the lid. She was at the back of the room. Between Marion's\nneat head and the coiffure of the little Jewess, the bored face of the\nexaminer peered and shifted. He was speaking--\n\n\"You will find the questions on your desks. Write your names in the top\nright-hand corner of each page. Full name. Kindly number the sheets. You\nare allowed two and a half hours.\"\n\nA pause. Some rustling of papers and the snap and rattle of\npencil-boxes. Then the voice of the examiner again--\n\n\"You may begin.\"\n\nInstantly a furious pen-scratching broke the hush. Louise glanced in the\ndirection of the sound, and smiled broadly. Agatha had begun. Miss\nHartill would have seen the joke, but the examiner was already absorbed\nin the book he had taken from his pocket. Louise gazed idly about her.\nSo this was what the ordeal was like! There were her clean, blank papers\non the desk before her, and the printed list of questions. She supposed\nshe had better begin.... But there was plenty of time. She had a curious\nsense of detachment. Her body surrounded her, rigid, quiescent, dreading\nexertion. Her mind, on the contrary, was bewilderingly active,\nconsciously alive with thoughts, as she had once, under a microscope,\nseen a drop of water alive with animalculi: thoughts, however, that had\nno connection with real life as it at the moment presented itself:\nthoughts that admitted the fact of the examination with a dreamy\nimpersonality that precluded any idea of participation. Her mind felt\ncomfortable in its warm bed of motionless flesh, would not disturb its\nrepose for all the ultimate gods might offer: but was interested\nnevertheless in its surroundings, gazing out into them with the detached\ncuriosity of an attic-dweller, peering out and down at a dwarfed and\ndistant street. Yet each trivial object on which her eyes alighted gave\nbirth to a train of thought that led separately, yet quite inevitably,\nto the memories that would shatter her quietude, as conscious and\nsubconscious self struggled for possession of her mind.\n\nShe stared at the intent backs of her neighbours. One by one they\nhunched forward, as each in turn settled to work. Louise considered them\ncritically. What ugly things backs were! It was funny, but girls with\ndark skirts always pinned them to their blouses with white safety-pins,\nand _vice versa_. It made them look skewered.... Yet Miss Durand had\nsaid that backs were the most expressive part of the whole body.... That\nwas the day they had seen the Watts pictures. But then the draperies of\nthe great white figure in \"Love and Death\" were not fastened up in the\nmiddle with safety-pins.... That had been a wonderful picture.... She\nknew how the boy felt, how he fought.... How long had he been able to\nhold the door? she wondered. Characteristically, she never questioned\nthe ultimate defeat. It was terrible to be so weak.... But the Death was\nbeautiful.... pitying.... One wouldn't hate it while one resisted it, as\none hated Mamma.... Mamma, forcing her way into an attic.... Louise\nwrithed as she thought of it.\n\nThe girl in front of her coughed, a hasty, grudging cough, recovered\nherself, and bent again to her work. Louise was amused. What a hurry she\nwas in! What a hurry every one was in! How hot Marion's cheeks were! And\nAgatha.... Agatha was up to her wrists in ink.... Like the women in the\nFrench Revolution.... Though that was blood, of course.... They were\nsteeped in gore.... It would be fascinating to write a story about the\nknitting women ... click--click--clicking--like a lot of pens\nscraping.... What were they all scribbling like that for? Of course, it\nwas the examination.... There was a paper on her own desk too.... How\nfunny!\n\n\"Distinguish between Shelley the poet, and Shelley the politician.\nIllustrate your meaning by quotations.\"\n\nShelley? The name was familiar.... She sells sea-shells....\n\n\"Give a short account of the life of Shakespeare.\"\n\nHe had a wife, hadn't he? A narrow, grudging woman, who couldn't\nunderstand him.... A woman like Mamma.... Mamma, who was turning out the\nattic and laughing at Louise.... Not that that mattered--but to clear\nthe attic--to take away Mother's things.... What would Mother\ndo--little, darling Mother...? It was holidays.... Mother would know....\nMother would be there, waiting for Louise. A hideous picture rose up in\nLouise's mind. With photographic clearness she saw the attic and the\nfaint shadow of her mother wavering from visibility to nothingness as\nthe sunlight caught and lost her impalpable outlines: there was a sound\nof footsteps--Louise heard it: the faint thing held out sweet arms and\nLouise strained towards them; but the door opened, and Mrs. Denny and\nthe maids came in. Mamma pointed, while the maids laughed and took their\nbrooms and chased the forlorn appearance, and it fled before them about\nthe room, cowering, afraid, calling in its whisper to Louise. But the\nmaids closed in, and swept that shrinking nothingness into the dark\ncorner behind the old trunk: but when they had moved the trunk, there\nwas nothing to be seen but a delicate cobweb or two. So they swept it\ninto the dustpan and settled down to the scrubbing of the floor.\n\nThe picture faded. Louise crouched over her desk, her head in her hands.\nAbout her the pens scratched rhythmically.\n\nFor a space she existed merely. She could not have told how long it was\nbefore thoughts began once more to drift across the blankness of her\nmind like the first imperceptible flakes that herald a fall of snow.\n\nShe moved stiffly in her seat. The thoughts came thicker--thoughts of\nher mother still, of the dream presence that she would not feel\nagain.... Never again? There was the Last Judgment, of course.... She\nwould see her then.... And who knew when the Judgment would come.... In\na thousand years? In the next five seconds? She counted slowly, holding\nher breath: \"One--two--three--four--five----\" and stared out expectantly\ninto space through the lashes of her dropped lids.\n\nAll about her sat forms, bowed like her own, scarcely moving. Of course,\nof course--she nodded to herself--satisfied with her own acuteness.\nObviously, the Last Judgment.... They were all waiting for God.... He\nhadn't arrived yet, it seemed.... Well, one might look about a little\nfirst.... How queer Heaven smelt! The heart of Louise leapt within\nher.... Now was the opportunity to find Mother.... Mother would be\nsomewhere among the dead.... But they all had ugly backs.... But\nMother.... Of course Mother would be standing on that high platform\nplace like a throne.... It was her place.... She always stood there....\nOr did she? Was there not some one else? very like her ... with eyes ...\nand a smile ... whom Louise knew so well? Wasn't it Mother? With patient\ndeliberation she strove to disentangle the two personalities, that\ncombined and divided and blurred again into one. There was Mother--and\nthe Other--one was shape and one was shadow--but which was real? There\nwas Mother--and the Other--who was Mother? No, who was--who was--The\nOther was not Mother--but if not, who?--who?--who?--\n\nA chorus of angels took up the chant: Who? who? who? They had flat,\nfaint voices, that gritted and whispered, like pens passing over paper.\n\nWho? who? who?\n\nThe answer came thundering back out of infinite space in the awaited\nvoice of God....\n\n\"You have ten minutes more.\"\n\nLouise gave a faint gasp. Reality enveloped her once more, licking up\nher illusion as instantly and fiercely as an unnoticed candle will\nshrivel up a woman's muslins. She stood naked amid the ashes of her\ndreams.\n\nShe glanced wildly about her. The girls at her elbows were furiously at\nwork. The little examiner had put away his book and was staring at her.\nHer eyes fell. Before her lay foolscap, fair and blank, save for her\nname in the corner, and a close-printed paper that she did not\nrecognise, clamouring for information anent Shelley, and Carlyle, and\nthe Mermaid Tavern. Because, of course, she was at the Literature\nexamination, and there were ten minutes more.\n\nAnd she had written nothing.\n\nAn instant she sat appalled. Then she snatched up her pen and wrote....\n\nHer pen fled across the paper at Tam o' Shanter speed, leaving its trail\nof shapeless, delirious sentences. She never paused to consider--she\nwrote. She knew only that she had ten--twelve--fifteen questions to\nanswer, and ten minutes in which to do it. Ten minutes for a two and a\nhalf hours' paper! No matter--if one stopped to think.... Hurry! hurry!\nShelley was born in 1792--he was the son of Sir Timothy Shelley, of\nField Place, near Horsham----\n\nWhen the examiner collected the papers, she had written exactly two\npages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nThe examination had taken place early in May, but the summer term was\nnearly over before news of the results arrived. When it came, it made\nbut a small sensation. The school had tired of waiting. Not only was its\nown more intimate examination drawing near, but its many heads were\nfilled, to the exclusion of all else, with the excitements and rivalries\nof the summer theatricals.\n\nThe school play was an institution. Of late years--ever since she had\njoined the staff indeed--it had grown into an annual personal triumph\nfor Miss Hartill.\n\nClare was blessed--cursed--with that sixth sense, the _sens du th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_.\nHer own nature was, in essence, theatrical; her frigid and fastidious\nreserve warring incessantly with her irrepressible love of the scene for\nits own sake. She was aware of the trait and humiliated by its presence\nin her character. Usually she would curb her inclination with a severity\nthat was in itself histrionic: at times she indulged it with voluptuous\nrecklessness.\n\nAs a girl, the stage had appealed to her strongly; but her excessive\nsqueamishness, with her acute sense of personal, bodily dignity, closed\nit to her as a career. Also her love of power. Though she knew little of\nstage life she had sufficient intuition to gauge correctly what she\nmight become. Successful necessarily--dominant never. And she required a\ndais. But the compelling woman, she knew, is successful through her\ncombination of intellectual strength with sexual charm. She must not\nscruple to use all the weapons at her service. Clare had told herself\nthat there were some weapons to which she would never condescend. If\nsting had lain in the fact that, though she would, they were not hers to\nuse, she did not acknowledge it, even to herself. Resolutely she put\nfrom her the idea of fostering a useless talent; and the desire to\nexploit it, save surreptitiously in social intercourse, dulled as she\ngrew older.\n\nNevertheless, the yearly plays were to Clare a source of excitement and\ngratification. She alone was responsible for the production. In five\nsuccessful years they had become an event, a festival--not only to the\nschool, but to the entire neighbourhood. Two, and then three public\nperformances were given each summer, and the proceeds benefited the\nschool charities. _As You Like It_, _Twelfth Night_, _Verona_, and _The\nMerchant of Venice_, followed upon the _Midsummer Night's Dream_, and\nexhausted the list of entirely suitable plays; but after some\nhesitation, Clare had devised for her next venture scenes from _King\nJohn_. Several forms were studying the period, the Sixths and Fifths\nwere reading the play, politically also it was apropos. (Clare had ever\nsound reasons to gild her decisions.) Privately she had been slightly\nembarrassed by the fact that the classes she supervised had that year\nproved themselves unusually poor in dramatic ability. She could depend,\nindeed, on a score of keen and capable children, but in Louise Denny\nalone had she glimpsed an actress who could do her credit. The child's\nphysique precluded her from r\u00c3\u00b4les that, otherwise, she could easily have\nfilled, but as Prince Arthur, she could be made the central,\nunforgettable figure of an otherwise trite performance. \"_King John_,\"\nquoth Clare; \"decidedly, the very play.\" And _King John_ was chosen.\n\nSince the beginning of the term, with Clare as generalissimo and Alwynne\nmost ingenious of adjutants, staff and school had worked\nenthusiastically. Costumes were finished, staging painted and planned,\nand the various scenes were, at length, receiving their final polish.\nAlwynne was responsible for the interpretation of the minor parts, while\nClare, in her spare time, devoted herself to the principals, attacking\nalternately the exaggerations of Agatha's \"Constance,\" Marion's stolid\n\"Hubert,\" a certain near-sighted amiability in the spectacled \"King\nJohn.\"\n\nClare was a born stage-manager, patient, resourceful, compelling. The\nchildren trusted her; she had the habit of success. Her air of authority\ncushioned them, denied the possibility of failure. Clare, wholly in\nearnest, Clare at usual hours, intimate and relaxed, Clare appealing,\nexhorting, inspiring, was irresistible. She got what she wanted from\nthem and was not ill content. She knew to the last ounce their\ncapabilities.\n\nWith Louise alone she had difficulties. The child was almost too easily\ntrained. Responsive, quickly fired or chilled, she was, in fact, too\ndelicately and completely attuned to Clare herself. Clare could be\ncrude: she had her gusty moods: the little \u00c3\u00a6olian harp quivered to\nsnapping point before them. Originally this extreme sensitiveness had\nfascinated Clare; she felt like a musician exploring the possibilities\nof an unknown instrument; but she tired of it in time. As Louise became\nsaturated with the stronger personality, she had, in her passionate\ndesire to satisfy Clare, grown into her mere replica; reproducing her\nphraseology, voicing her opinions, reflecting her moods, stifling, in\nthe exquisite delight of abnegation, all in her that had originally\nattracted the older woman. That the effect had been, first to amuse,\nthen to irritate, finally to bore Clare's fickle humour, was natural\nenough. Clare, had she cared, could have guided the child, despite the\ngreat disparity of age, into a pleasant path of affection and\nfriendship, but that she did not choose. She was disappointed, and\nshowed it: and there, for her, the matter ended. That she was in any way\nresponsible, she would not admit.\n\nShe did not, indeed, fully realise the extent of the change in Louise\nuntil the rehearsals began. For all her growing indifference, in spite\nof the marked deterioration that automatically it had caused in the\ngirl's work, she had still a high and just opinion of her capabilities.\nShe was positive that as Prince Arthur, Louise would give a fine and\noriginal performance, and anticipated with amused interest her initial\nrendering of the character.\n\nAt the first rehearsal Louise did not disappoint her. She was neither\nstiff nor self-conscious, and her acting, which proved to be entirely\ninstinctive, carried conviction. Though Clare worked from the head, she\ncould appreciate the more primitive method, but even then, the character\nas portrayed by Louise amazed her. The deliberate pathos, the cloying\ncharm, did not seem to exist for Louise. She played as in an ecstasy of\nterror. The text, Clare knew, could permit the reading, and the\nconception interested her; but the temptation to criticise, alter and\nimprove, was natural. Here and there, as rehearsals progressed, she\npulled and patched and patted--quite genuinely in the interest of the\nplay as a whole. But the result was discouraging. The Louise of former\ndays would have defended her own version, delighting Clare with shy\nimpudences and flashes of insight, na\u00c3\u00afve parries and counter-attacks,\ntill between them they had attained notable results. But the sparkle had\nbeen drilled out of Louise. She was humble, anxiously acquiescent,\nagreeing with every alteration, accepting every suggestion, however\nforeign to her own instinctive convictions, while the vividness faded\nslowly from her reading, leaving it lifeless and forced.\n\n\"It's patchwork,\" said Clare disgustedly to Alwynne, at the end of the\nthird week, \"pure patchwork. She does everything I tell her--and the\nresult is dire. What it will be like on the night, heaven knows! And\nthere's nobody else. Yet she _can_ act. That first performance was quite\nexcellent.\"\n\n\"And she tries.\"\n\n\"She slaves! She would be less irritating if she didn't. You know,\nAlwynne, I let myself go yesterday. I told her how impossible she was.\nAnd all she did was to look at me like a mournful monkey!\"\n\n\"Inarticulate. Exactly.\"\n\nClare lifted her eyebrows. Alwynne looked at her quaintly.\n\n\"You know perfectly well what's wrong. Why on earth don't you leave her\nalone?\"\n\n\"Uncoached?\"\n\n\"That as well, of course. You said yourself she was excellent at first.\nWhy don't you leave her to herself? It's safe. She's not like the\nothers. She's a nectarine, not a potato. Give her a free hand till the\ndress-rehearsal. It won't be your reading--I prefer yours, too; at least\nI think I do----\"\n\n\"I'm glad you say 'think.' But think again. There's no question of which\nyou ought to prefer. But I, my good child, must consider my public! It\nwants to enjoy itself! It wants to weep salt tears! Louise's reading\nwould cheat it of its emotions!\"\n\n\"At least it will be a reading, not a repetition. I don't mean that,\nthough, when I say--leave her alone. Clare--you won't realise what you\nmean to people!\"\n\n\"I don't follow----\" but Clare laughed a little.\n\n\"You do. You know you've made Louise crazy about you.\" Clare shrugged\nimpatiently.\n\n\"I dislike these enthusiasms.\"\n\n\"But you cause them. I think it is rather mean to shirk the\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"Really, Alwynne!\" But Clare was still smiling.\n\n\"You do. You begin by being heavenly to people--and then you tantalise\nthem.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt, Alwynne? Are you going to run away?\"\n\nAlwynne smiled.\n\n\"Oh, you won't get rid of me so easily. I'm a limpet. Do you know, I\ncouldn't imagine existence without you now. I've never been so\ngloriously happy in my life. You wouldn't ever get really tired of me,\nwould you?\"\n\n\"I wonder.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"I've warned you that I'm changeable. Instance your Louise.\"\n\n\"Oh, Clare, do be nicer to Louise.\"\n\n\"Oh, Alwynne, do mind your own business. I'm as nice as is good for her.\nBut I believe you're right about this acting. I'll wash my hands of her\ntill the dress-rehearsal, if you like. You can tell her I said so.\"\n\nBut Alwynne, whispering to Louise that perhaps the old way was better\nafter all, that Miss Hartill had said she didn't mind, achieved little.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Durand--don't let her think I'm hopeless. I shall get it right\nin time. I'd rather stick to the way she showed me. Miss Durand--do you\nthink she's angry? Honestly, I will get it right. Miss Durand--I suppose\nthere's no news?\"\n\nThe child's face was very drawn; her eyes seemed larger than ever; she\nlooked like a little old woman! Alwynne was concerned; she felt vaguely\nresponsible. She, too, wished that the news, good or bad, would come,\nand put an end at least to the tension.\n\nAnd one morning, all unexpectedly, the news did come.\n\nThe performances were but two days away. The decorous Big Hall was in\nconfusion. The school sat, picnic-fashion, for its prayers; and the head\nmistress, entering between half-hung cloths, mounted a battlemented\nrostrum to address it. She carried a sheaf of papers. Louise, sitting\nwith her class at the further end of the hall, outwardly decorous\nenough, was in reality paying little attention. Her vague, unhappy\nthoughts were concerned with the coming rehearsal; she could not\nremember what Miss Hartill's last directions had been; she was sure she\nshould stumble. Sometimes the mere words seemed to evade her. Yet the\nplay was on her shoulders--Miss Durand had said so. She supposed Prince\nArthur was really fond of Hubert? Not pretending, because he was afraid?\nBut of course it was easy to love a person and yet be terrified of them.\nShe stole a look at Clare, prominent in the grave group of mistresses.\nThey were all very intent. It dawned on her that the head mistress had\nbeen speaking for several minutes.\n\nSuddenly there was an outburst of clapping. The spectacled girl at the\nend of the row grew pink and stared at her hands.\n\n\"What is it?\" breathed Louise. \"Oh, what is it? What is it?\"\n\nA neighbour caught the murmur and looked down at her curiously.\n\n\"Are you asleep? It's the lists. Your exam. You'll be second, I expect.\"\n\nBut Marion was second.\n\nThe clapping crackled up anew.\n\nSo the news was come!\n\nIt was cruel to let it spring upon you thus.... You would have asked so\nlittle ... ten minutes ... a bare ... in which to brace yourself....\nSurprise was horrible ... it caught you with your soul half-naked ... it\nshocked like sudden noise....\n\nThere came a fresh outburst.\n\nIt was wicked to make such sounds ... like all the policeman's-rattles\nin the world....\n\nThe reading proceeded; it calmed her; it barely stirred the beautiful\nsilence. But presently the neat voice altered. Old Edith Marsham was a\nkindly soul. She had not quite forgotten her own schooldays. She\nrealised, perfunctorily, as the successful do, the blankness of defeat.\nLouise heard her name pronounced, a trifle hurriedly. Louise\nDenny--failed.\n\nShe made no sign. She sat erect, listening to the conclusion of that\nmatter, clapped in due course, stood, kneeled, rose again, as applause,\nhymns and prayers buzzed about her, filed with her class from the hall\nand added her shy word to the clamour of congratulation in the long\ncorridors. Inwardly, she was stunned by the evil that was upon her.\n\nThe irregular morning classes (the imminent entertainment had\ndisorganised the entire system of work) gave her time to rouse, to\nreview her position.\n\nShe turned helplessly within herself, wondering how she should begin to\nthink--and where. She wondered idly if this was how soldiers felt, when\na shell had blown them to pieces? She wondered how they collected\nthemselves afterwards? Where did they begin? Did an arm pick up the legs\nand head, or how?\n\nThe picture thus conjured up struck her as excessively funny. She began\nto giggle. The mistress's astonished voice roused her to the necessity\nfor self-control. She picked up her pen. The thoughts flowed more\nclearly--yes, like ink in a pen.\n\nSo it had come.\n\nAll along she had known that she must have failed: known it from the day\nof the examination itself. The burden of that knowledge had been upon\nher for weeks like a secret guilt. Daily she had gone to prayers in cold\nfear, thinking: \"Now--now--now--they will read it out.\" Daily she had\nstudied Clare's face, to each change of expression, each abstraction or\ntransient sternness, her heart beating out its one thought: \"She had\nheard! she knows!\" And yet behind her academic certainty of failure had\nlain a little illogical hope. There was just a chance--an examiner more\nkind than just ... a spilled ink-bottle ... an opportune fire. The child\nin her could still pray for miracles, for help from fairyland, and half\nbelieve it on the way.\n\nAnd now the daily terrors, the daily reliefs, were alike over. Louise,\nwho had learned, as she thought, to do without hope these many weeks,\nrealised pitifully her self-deception. This hopelessness, this dead\nweight of certainty, was a new burden--a Sisyphus rock which would never\nroll for her. She was at the end.\n\nHer mind, for all its forced and hot-house development, had, in matters\nof raw fact, the narrow outlook of the schoolgirl, superimposed upon\nthe passions, the more intense for their utter innocence, of the child.\nHer sense of proportion, that latest developed and most infallible sign\nof maturity, was embryonic. The examination, so intrinsically\nunimportant, appeared to her a Waterloo. She could not see beyond it.\n\nClare, inexplicably altering, daily sterner and more indifferent, save\nfor stray gleams of whimsical kindness, that stung and maddened the\nchild by their sweetness and rarity, would, Louise considered, be\neffectually alienated. But Louise could not conceive life possible\nwithout Clare. The future was a night of black misery, without a hint of\ndawn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nThe morning wore to an end. Clare had come in at the mid-morning break\nto announce that the dress rehearsal would take place on the afternoon\nof the following day. All costumes were to be ready. The day-girls were\nto lunch at the school. She was brief and businesslike, inaccessible to\nquestions. She did not look at Louise.\n\nAlwynne, later in the morning, supplementing her instructions, paused a\nmoment at the child's desk. But Louise gave no sign. Alwynne hesitated.\nShe herself was averse from verbal sympathy. Also she was pressed for\ntime, and Clare, she knew, wanted her. The one o'clock bell shattered\nher indecision. She gave her directions and hurried away.\n\nLouise packed her books together and went home.\n\nShe endured the cheerful noisy lunch; carried out some small commissions\nfor her step-mother; shepherded the troop of small boys into the paddock\nbehind the garden and saw them established at their games. She stayed a\nmoment with the round two-year-old, sprawling by the pile of coats, but\nhe, too, had his amusements. Every pocket tempted his enquiring fingers.\nHe ignored her.\n\nShe went back to the house. Habit brought her for the fiftieth time to\nthe attic, and she had opened the door before she remembered. She looked\nabout her. An iron bedstead, covered by a crude quilt, stood where the\ntrunk of books had lain. A square of unswept carpet lay before it. There\nwas a deal night-table and a candlestick of blue tin, with matches and a\nguttered candle. Across a chair lay a paper-back, face downwards, and a\npair of soiled red corsets. The ivy had been cut away from the window,\nand the sunlight cast no fantastic frieze, but a squared, black shadow\non the floor. The air was close, and a little rank. Louise shrank from\nit.\n\n\"Mother?\" she said; and then: \"You've gone away, haven't you? It's no\nuse calling?\"\n\nShe waited. The uneven water-jug rattled in its basin.\n\nShe spoke again--\n\n\"Mother, I know it's all spoiled here, but couldn't you come? Just for a\nlittle while, Mother? I'm most miserable. Please, Mother?\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" cried Louise wildly. \"What shall I do? Oh, what shall\nI do?\"\n\nShe turned from that empty place, stumbled to her room, and flung\nherself across her bed. She was shaken by her misery, as a dog shakes a\nrat. She cried, her head on her arms, till she was sick and blinded.\nLoneliness and longing seared her as with irons.\n\nThe clock ticked, and the sunshine poured into the room. The shouts of\nthe children, the crack of the ball on bat sounded faintly. The house\nslept. Two hours passed.\n\nSomewhere a clock chimed and boomed. Four o'clock.\n\nSlowly and stiffly Louise roused herself and got off her bed. She was\ncramped and shivering. She stood in the middle of the room and held out\nher hands to the brassy sunlight, but it did not warm her. She felt\ndazed and giddy; her head burned as if there were live coals in it. Her\nthoughts flowed sluggishly; she found it impossible to hurry them; they\nsplit apart into fragments that were words and meaningless phrases, or\nstuck like cogged wheels. Her mind moved across immense spaces to adjust\nthese difficulties, but she policed them in vain. There was one\nsentence, in particular, that she could not deal with. It would not move\nalong and make room for other thoughts. It danced before her; its grin\nspanned the horizon; it inhabited her mind; it was reversible like a\nLiberty satin; it ticked like a clock: \"What next? What next? What next?\nNext what? Next what? Next what?\"\n\nWhat next?... Dully she reckoned it up. The tea-bell--homework--bedtime.\nNight--and the false dreams. Morning--and the anger of Miss Hartill. Day\nand week and month--and the anger of Miss Hartill. The years stretched\nout before her in infinite repetition of the afternoon's agony, till her\nraw nerves shrank appalled. Kneeling down, she told God that it was\nimpossible for her to endure this desolation. She implored Him, if He\nshould in truth exist, not to reckon her doubt against her, but to be\nmerciful and let her die. It was not the first time that she had prayed\nthus, but never before with such fierce insistence. If He existed He\ncould impossibly refuse....\n\nSpeaking her thoughts, even to so indefinite a Listener, steadied her. A\nghost of hope had drifted through her mind. A ghost indeed; a messenger\nthat whispered not of waking but of sleep, not of arduous renewing but\nof an end. Death was life upon his lips and life, death; yet he was none\nthe less a hope.\n\nThe familiar text upon the wall above her bed caught her eye. The\nmessage seemed no more miraculous than the pansies and mistletoe that\nwreathed about its gilt and crimson capitals. \"God is our Refuge and\nStrength, a very present Help in Trouble.\" \"Ask and it shall be given\nunto you\" confirmed her from the other wall.\n\nShe sat between those tremendous statements and considered them.\n\nGod had never yet answered any prayer of hers.... Not, she supposed,\nthat He could not, but because He did not choose.... He was rather like\nMiss Hartill.... But Miss Hartill would never understand.... At least\none could explain things to God--if God were.... And she asked so little\nof Him--just to let her die and be at peace.... She thought He might--if\nHe had even time for sparrows.... She wondered how He would manage it!\nIf He would only be quick--because red-hot wires ran through her head\nwhen she tried to think, and she was afraid--afraid--afraid--of\nto-morrow and Miss Hartill....\n\nThe tea-bell pealed across the garden.\n\nShe tidied her hair, and fetching the sponge and towel stood before the\nglass, trying to trim her marred face into some semblance of composure.\nThe boys would be clamouring--and one never knew.... There might be\ntainted food--a loose baluster--a tag of carpet.... He had his ways....\nShe must not baulk Him....\n\nShe went downstairs.\n\nThe children were tired and cross and quarrelsome--the heat had soured\neven cheerful Mrs. Denny. It was not a pleasant meal. But it could not\noppress Louise. Outwardly docile and attentive, her mind had withdrawn\ninto itself and sat aloof, inviolate, surveying its surroundings much as\nit would have watched the actors in a moving picture. She was impervious\nto bickerings and querulous comment. What did it matter? She would never\nhave tea with them again.... She was going away from it all.... If only\nGod did not forget....\n\nAll through the breathless evening she awaited His pleasure.\n\nLong after the house was quiet, and Mrs. Denny tucking up her children,\nhad come and gone, Louise lay wakeful--still waiting.\n\nIt was an airless night. Every other moment the little unaccountable\nnoises of a sleeping building broke the warm silence. Shadows scurried\nacross the counterpane and over her face like ghostly mice, as the trees\noutside her window bent and nodded to a radiant moon.\n\nShe was weary to the point of exhaustion. Momently her body seemed to\nshrink away from her into the depths of the bed--warm, fathomless\ndepths--leaving her essential self to float free and uncontained. She\nwould resign herself luxuriously to the sensation of disintegration, but\nwith maddening regularity her next breath clicked body and soul together\nanew. Yet, as she drowsed, the space between breath and breath\nlengthened slowly, till they lay divided by incredible \u00c3\u00a6ons in which her\nthoughts wandered and lost themselves, grew hoar and died and were born\nagain; while the dead-weight of her body sank ever deeper into sleep,\nwas recalled to consciousness with ever increasing effort.\n\nShe speculated languidly upon her sensations. They recalled a day at the\ndentist's, years before. A tube had been placed over her mouth and she\nhad struggled, remembering a hideous story of a woman--a French\nmarquise--that she had read in a magazine. The name began with a \"B\" or\na \"V.\" \"Brin--\" something. The Funnel--_The Leather Funnel_--that was\nthe name of the story.... But there came no choking water--only sweet,\nbuzzing air.... And then her body had dropped away from her, as it was\ndoing now.... She recalled the sensation of rest and freedom; she had\npassed, like a bird planing down warm breezes, into exquisite\noblivion.... She had returned, centuries later, to a dull aching pain,\nharsh noises, and lights that were like blows.... But if she had not\nreturned? She would have been dead.... They would have buried her....\nSuch things had happened.... So that was death--that cradling, beautiful\nsleep. And God was sending it to her now; flooding her, drowning her in\nits warm comfort.... God was very good.... She was sorry--sorry that she\nhad often not believed in Him.... But Miss Hartill didn't.... But she\nwould never see Miss Hartill any more.... Perhaps, years after, when she\nwas tired of sleeping, she would go back and see her again.... There was\nAll Souls' Night, when you woke up.... But she would not frighten Miss\nHartill.... She laughed a little, to think that she could ever frighten\nMiss Hartill.... She would just kiss her, a little ghost's kiss that\nwould feel like a puff of air ... and then she would go back and sleep\nand sleep and sleep ... with only the yew-berries pattering on to her\ngravestone to tell her when another year had drifted past.... It was\nfunny that people could be afraid to die.... She wondered if ghosts\nsnored, and if you heard them, if your grave were very close? It was her\nlast thought as she slid into slumber.\n\nInstantly the breakfast gong came crashing across her peace. She fought\nagainst waking. Her eyelids lifted the weight upon them as violets press\nupwards against a clod of rotten leaves. She lay dazedly, her mind\ncobwebbed with dreams, her thoughts trickling back into the channels of\nthe previous night. Slowly she took in her situation. There was the\nwindow, and a shining day without: she could hear the starlings\nquarrelling on the lawn, and the squeak of an angry robin.... There was\nher room, and the tidy pile of clothes by the bed ... the bed, and she\nherself lying in it.... So she was not dead! There was to-day to be\nfaced, and Miss Hartill's anger, and all the other hundreds and\nthousands of days....\n\nAnd she must get up at once.\n\nHer sick mind shrank from that, as from a culminating terror. She was\ndesperately tired; her body ached as if it had been beaten. Dressing was\na monstrous and impossible feat.... It could not be.... Yet her\nstep-mother would come--she was between God and Mrs. Denny--and God had\nleft her in the lurch.\n\nShe lay shielding her eyes from the strong light.\n\nThe pressure on her eyeballs was causing the usual kaleidoscopic ring of\nlight to form within her closed lids. The phenomenon had always been a\nchildish amusement to her; she was adept at the shifting pressure that\ncould vary colour and pattern. She watched idly. Red changed to green,\npurple followed yellow, and the ring narrowed to a pin-point of light on\nits background of watered silk; then it broke up as usual into starry\nfragments. But they danced no dazzling fire-dance for her ere they\nmerged again into the yellow ring; to her distracted fancy they were\nletters--fiery letters, that formed and broke and formed again.\nG--O--D--then an H and a P and an L. She puzzled over them. \"God hopes?\"\n\"God helps?\" But He hadn't.... \"God helps?\" A Voice in her ears exactly\nlike her own took it up--\"Those that help themselves.\" It spoke so\nloudly that she shrank. The universe echoed to Its boom: yet she knew\nso well that the Voice was only in her own head.\n\nNo wonder her head ached, when it was all full of Lights and Voices....\nAnd Miss Hartill would be angry if she took Them to school.... If only\nshe need not go to school.... Why--why had God cheated her? \"He helped\nthose----\" Was that what They meant?\n\nShe looked about her, brightening yet uncertain; then her long plait of\nhair caught her eye. Lazily she lifted it, disentangled a strand no\nthicker than coarse string, and doubling it about her throat, began to\ntighten it, using her fingers as a lever, till the blood sang in her\nears. She had sat upright in bed for the greater ease. Suddenly she\ncaught sight of her face in the wardrobe mirror. It was growing pink and\npuffy; the eyes goggled a little. The sensation of choking grew\nunendurable. Instinctively her fingers freed themselves and the noose\nfell apart. She swung forward, panting, and watched her features grow\nnormal again.\n\n\"It's no good. Oh, I am a coward,\" cried Louise, wearily.\n\nHer mother's old-fashioned travelling clock, chiming the quarter,\nanswered her, and for a moment forced her thoughts back from those\nborderlands where sanity ends. Habit asserted itself; she was filled\nwith everyday anxieties. She was late, certainly for breakfast, probably\nfor school. She jumped out of bed, washed and dressed in panic speed,\ncollected her belongings and hurried from the house.\n\nHer father, hearing the gate clack, glanced up from his newspaper.\n\n\"Has that child had any breakfast?\" he demanded, uneasily.\n\nThere was no answer. He was late himself, and his wife had poured his\ncoffee and left the room. He could hear her heavy footfall in their\nbedroom overhead.\n\nHe returned to his reading.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nLouise ran up the steep hill, her satchel padding at her back, the soft\nwind disordering her hair and whipping a colour into her white cheeks.\nShe gained the deserted cloakroom, flung off her hat, and fled upstairs.\nBut she was later than she guessed. Racing, against all rules, through\nthe upper hall and down the long corridor, the drone of voices as she\npassed the glass-panelled doors warned her that no hurrying could avail\nher. She was definitely late. Her speed slackened.\n\nThe passage ended at right-angles to a small landing, into which her\nclass-room opened. She paused, sheltering in the curve of the hall,\nlistening. The class was still. The single voice of a mistress rang\nmuffled through the walls. She could not distinguish the accents.\n\nIt was Miss Durand's class; but when everything was so upset ... one\nnever knew ... it might be Miss Hartill herself.... That would be just\nLouise's luck.... She hated you to be late.... But there was no point in\nhesitating....\n\nYet she hesitated, shifting her weight uneasily from foot to foot, till\na far-off step in the corridor without, ended her uncertainty. Some one\nwas coming.... That again might be Miss Hartill.... Louise must be in\nher place.... Yet surely it was Miss Hartill's voice in the form-room?\n\nShe crept to the door and peered through the glass.\n\nMiss Durand was standing at the blackboard.\n\nLouise entered, brazen with relief, and began her apologies. But Alwynne\nwas no Rhadamanthus, and her official reprobation was marred by a\ntwinkle. She would have been late herself that morning, but for\nElsbeth--poor dear Elsbeth, who conceded, without remotely\ncomprehending, the joys of that extra twenty minutes. And when had\nLouise been late before? Little, good, frightened Louise! She entered\nthe name in the defaulters' book, but her manner sent the child to her\ndesk quieted.\n\nAlwynne, at sentry-go between blackboard and rostrum, dictating,\nsupervising, expounding, yet found time to watch her. Louise was always\na little on her motherly young mind. The child's shrinking manner\nworried her--and her pain-haunted eyes. Pain was Alwynne's devil. She\nwas selfish, as youth must be, but at least, unconsciously. Hint\ntrouble, and all of her was eager to serve and save. She was the\ninstinctive Samaritan. But her perception was blurred by her profound\nbelief in Clare. Louise, she knew, was in good hands, in wise hands;\nwhere she had known ten children, Clare had trained a hundred; if\nClare's ways were not hers--so much the worse for hers.\n\nYet this disciplining of Louise was a long business; she wished it need\nnot make the child so wretched. Surely Clare forgot how young she\nwas.... There would be new trouble over the affair of the papers.... If\nClare would but be commonplace for once, laugh, and say it didn't\nmatter, and perhaps ask Louise to tea.... The child would be radiant for\nanother six months--and work better too.... But, of course, it was\nabsurd for her to dictate to Clare.... Louise had had such a pretty\ncolour when she came in; it was all gone now.... She looked dreadfully\nthin.... Alwynne wondered if it would do any good to speak to Clare\nagain.... Dear Clare--she was so proud of her girls, so eager to see\nthem successful.... Louise was a bitter disappointment to her.... Yet,\nif she could have been gentler--but, of course, Clare knew best....\nAlwynne only hoped the rehearsal would be a success. If Louise did well,\nit might adjust the tension....\n\nShe watched the child, sitting apparently attentive, noted the moving\nlips, the little red volume half hidden in her lap. Shakespeare had no\nbusiness in a physiology lesson, but Alwynne let her alone.\n\nThe hour was over all too quickly for Louise. Earlier in the year, when\nshe had been at her most brilliant, and Miss Hartill's classes the\nabsorbing joy of her day, she had yet welcomed the hours with Miss\nDurand. They alone had not seemed, in comparison, a waste of priceless\ntime. They were jolly hours, quick-stepping, cheerful, laughter-flecked;\nvoid of excitements, yet never savourless; above all restful.\nUnconsciously she had counted on them for their recuperative value. Even\nnow, exhausted, overwrought, beyond all influence, the kindly atmosphere\ncould at least soothe her. Wistfully her eyes followed Alwynne, as the\nyoung mistress left the room.\n\nClamour arose; slamming of desk-lids, thud of satchels and rattle of\npencil-cases mingling with the babble of tongues. The next lesson was\nFrench Grammar. The little Frenchwoman was invariably late. She dreaded\nthe lesson as much as her audience enjoyed it. They welcomed it as a\npleasant interlude--the hour for conversation. Agatha did not even\ntrouble to keep an eye on the door, as she turned to Louise, immobile\nbeside her.\n\n\"I say, were you late?\"\n\n\"Didn't you see?\"\n\n\"Why were you late? Weren't you called? Didn't you wake up?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, the housemaid died in the night. Smallpox.\" Louise stooped over her\nbook, her shoulders hunched against questions.\n\n\"No, but tell me. Did you get in a row?\"\n\n\"You heard what Daffy said. I want to learn, Agatha.\"\n\n\"Oh, not that. Did you get in a row about the rehearsal?\"\n\n\"What rehearsal?\"\n\n\"The rehearsal yesterday.\"\n\nLouise sat up, her eyes widening.\n\n\"There was no rehearsal yesterday?\" she said anxiously.\n\n\"Wasn't there just!\"\n\n\"But I never heard; nobody told me.\"\n\n\"Why, Daffy came in herself, yesterday morning. Every one was there. I\nsuppose you were moonstruck as usual. Do you mean to say you didn't\nhear? I don't envy you.\"\n\n\"Was she angry?\" said Louise, in her smallest voice.\n\nAgatha began to enjoy herself.\n\n\"Angry? She was raving!\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\n\"Well, she didn't say much,\" admitted Agatha. \"Just asked where you\nwere, and if not, why not--you know her way. Then we got started and\nwent all through it, and had a gorgeous afternoon. She read your part. I\nsay, she can act, can't she? But she was pretty mad, of course.\"\n\n\"Was she--\" said Louise. But it was not a question.\n\n\"Oh, and you're to go to her at break, this morning. Don't go and\nforget, and then say I didn't tell you.\" And she turned to greet the\nentering mistress with a flood of Anglo-French.\n\nLouise had three parts of an hour in which to assimilate the message.\nHow unlucky she was! She remembered the previous morning as one\nremembers a nightmare.... Miss Durand had certainly drifted through its\ndreadfulness--but of what she had said or done, Louise remembered\nnothing. But it was certain that she had managed to annoy Miss Hartill\nmore than ever. To miss a special rehearsal! Now she was to go to her,\nand Miss Hartill would be so angry already, that when the question of\nthe papers arose, the last chance of her leniency was gone.... For, of\ncourse, she would speak of the examination.... What would she say? Her\nimagination stubbed; it could not pierce the terror of what Miss Hartill\nwould say.\n\nThe break was half over before she had wrenched herself out of her desk,\nalong the length of the school, and up the staircase to Clare's little\nsanctum.\n\nShe knocked timidly. Clare's answering bell, that invariably startled\nher, rang sharply. She hesitated--the bell rang again, a prolonged,\nshrill peal. She pulled herself together, opened the door, and went in.\n\nThe floor was littered with gay costumes. Miss Durand, in a big apron,\nlaughter-flushed, with her pretty hair tumbling down her back, was\nsorting them into neat heaps.\n\nClare, at ease in a big arm-chair, directing operations, while her quick\nfingers cut and pasted at a tinsel crown, was laughing also.\n\n\"How happy they look,\" thought Louise.\n\nClare glanced up.\n\n\"Well, Louise,\" she said, not unkindly.\n\nLouise stammered a little.\n\n\"Miss Hartill--I'm very sorry--I'm most awfully sorry. They said--the\ngirls said--there was rehearsal yesterday, and you wanted me. I honestly\ndidn't know. I've only just heard there was one.\"\n\nClare kept her waiting while she clipped at the indentations of the\ncrown. The scissors clicked and flashed. It seemed an interminable\nprocess.\n\nFinally she spoke to Alwynne, her eyes on her work.\n\n\"Miss Durand! You gave my message to the Fifths?\"\n\nYes, Alwynne had told the girls.\n\n\"Wasn't Louise in the room at the time?\"\n\nAlwynne's unwilling eyes took in every detail of the forlorn figure\nbetween them. She lied swiftly, amazing herself--\n\n\"As a matter of fact--I believe Louise was not in the room at the time.\nIt was my fault: I should have seen that she was told. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nLouise gave a little gasp of relief--more audible than she realised.\n\nClare roused at it. She disliked a check. She disliked also the obvious\nsympathy between the child and the girl.\n\n\"No, it was my fault. I should have gone myself. It's always wiser. It\nsaves trouble in the long run. Never mind, Louise. You couldn't help it.\nAre you sure of your words?\"\n\nLouise, infinitely relieved, was quite sure of her words.\n\n\"Very well. Shut the door after you--oh, Louise!\"\n\nLouise turned in the doorway.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Hartill.\"\n\n\"I may as well explain to you now. I am re-arranging the classes.\"\n\nLouise questioned her mutely.\n\n\"You will be in the Upper Fourth next term.\"\n\nLouise stood petrified. She had never thought of this.\n\n\"You are moving me down? I am third still.\"\n\n\"We think--Miss Marsham agrees with me--that the work in the Fifth is\ntoo much for you. It is not your fault.\"\n\n\"Miss Hartill, I have tried--I am trying.\"\n\nClare smiled quite pleasantly.\n\n\"I am quite sure of it. I tell you that I'm not blaming you. I blame\nmyself. If I expected more of you than you could manage--no one but\nmyself is to blame. I am sure you will do well in the Fourth.\"\n\nLouise broke out passionately--\n\n\"It is because of the examination.\"\n\nClare held out her crown at arm's length, and eyed it between criticism\nand approval as she answered Louise.\n\n\"I think,\" said Clare smoothly, \"we had better not discuss the\nexamination.\"\n\nLouise stood in the doorway, her mouth quivering.\n\nAlwynne could stand the scene no longer. She jerked herself upright,\nand, going to the child, slipped her arm about her and pushed her gently\nfrom the room.\n\nClare was still admiring her crown, as Alwynne shut the door again.\nAlwynne must try it on. It would suit Alwynne.\n\nAlwynne peeped at herself in the little mirror, but her thoughts were\nwith Louise on the other side of the door.\n\n\"Clare,\" said Alwynne uneasily, \"you hurt that child.\"\n\nClare looked at her oddly.\n\n\"Do her good,\" she said. \"Do you think no one has ever hurt me?\"\n\nAlwynne was silent. At times her goddess puzzled her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nTo the schoolgirls the dress rehearsal was, if possible, more of an\nordeal than the performances themselves. The head mistress attended in\nstate with the entire staff and such of the girls as were not themselves\nacting. Stray relatives, unable to be present at the play proper, dotted\nthe more distant benches, or were bestowed in the overhanging galleries,\nwhile the servants, from portly matron to jobbing gardener, clustered at\nthe back of the hall.\n\nThe platform at the upper end had been built out to form a stage, and\nwhen, late in the afternoon, the final signal had been given and the\nimprovised curtains drew audibly apart, Clare had fair reason to plume\nherself on her stage-management.\n\nThe long blinds of the windows had been let down and shut out the\nsceptical sunshine; and the candle footlights, flickering\nunprofessionally, mellowed the paintwork and patterned the home-made\nscenery with re-echoing lights, pools of unaccountable shadow, and\nshaftlike, wavering, prismatic gleams, flinging over the crude\nstage-setting a veil of fantastic charm.\n\nThe play opened, however, dully enough. The scenes chosen had had\ninevitably to be compressed, run together, mangled, and Clare had not\nfound it easy work. Faulconbridge, bowdlerised out of all existence,\ncould not tickle his hearers, and King John, not yet broken in to crown\nand mantle, gave him feeble support. But with the entrance of Constance,\nArthur and the French court, actors and audience alike bestirred\nthemselves.\n\nAgatha, her dark eyes flashing, her lank figure softened and rounded by\nthe generous sweep of her geranium-coloured robes, looked an authentic\nstage queen. Her exuberant movements and theatrical intonation had been\nskilfully utilised by Clare, who, playing on her eager vanity, had\nalternately checked and goaded her into a plausible rendering of the\npart. She was the reverse of nervous; her voice rolled her opening\nspeech without a tremor; her impatient, impetuous delivery (she hardly\nlet her fellow-actors finish their lines) fitted the character and was\neffective enough.\n\nYet to Clare, note-book in hand, prepared to pounce, cat-like, on\ndeficiencies, neither she nor her foil dominated the stage, nor the row\nof schoolgirl princes. Her critical appreciation was for the little\nfigure, wavering uncertainly between the shrieking queens, with scared\nanxious eyes, that swept the listening circle in faint appeal, quivering\nlike a sensitive plant at each verbal assault, shrinking beneath the\nhail of blandishments and reproaches. The one speech of the scene, the\nreproof of Constance, was spoken with un-childlike, weary dignity--\n\n     \"Good my mother, peace!\n     I would that I were low laid in my grave;\n     I am not worth this coil that's made for me.\"\n\nYet it was not Arthur that spoke, nor Louise--no frightened boy or\noverwrought, precocious girl. It was the voice of childhood itself,\nsexless, aloof; childhood the eternal pilgrim, wandering passive and\nperplexed, an elf among the giants: childhood, jostled by the uncaring\ncrowd, swayed by gross energies and seared by alien passions.\n\n\"She's got it,\" muttered Clare to Alwynne, reporting progress in the\ninterval; \"oh, how she's got it!\" She laughed shortly. \"So that's her\nreading. Impudent monkey! But she's got her atmosphere. Uncanny, isn't\nit? It reminds me--do you remember that performance of hers last autumn\nwith _Childe Roland_? I told you about it. Well, this brings it back,\nrather. Clever imp. I wonder how much of my coaching in this act she'll\ncondescend to leave in?\"\n\n\"You gave her a free hand, you know,\" deprecated Alwynne.\n\n\"I did. But it's impudence----\"\n\n\"Inspiration----\"\n\n\"Impudence all the same. When the rehearsal is over I must have a little\nconversation with Miss Denny.\" She showed her white teeth in a smile.\n\nAlwynne caught her up uneasily--\n\n\"Clare--you're not going to scold? It wouldn't be fair. You know you're\nas pleased as Punch, really.\"\n\nClare shot a look at her, but Alwynne's face was innocent and anxious.\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Am I? I suppose I am. I don't know. On my word, Alwynne, I don't know!\nBut run along, my deputy. There's an agitated orb rolling in your\ndirection from the join of the curtains.\"\n\nAlwynne fled.\n\nThe opening scene of the second division of the play--as Clare had\nplanned it--showed Arthur a prisoner to John and the old queen. The\nchild's face was changed, his manner strained; his startled eyes darted\nrestlessly from Hubert to the king and back again to Hubert; the pair\nseemed to fascinate him. Yet he shrank from their touch and from\nElinor's embrace, only to check the instinctive movement with pitiful,\npropitiatory haste, and to submit, his small fists clenched, to their\ncaresses. His eyes never left their faces; you saw the tide of fear\nrising in his soul. Not till the interview with Hubert, however, was the\nmorbid drift of the conception fully apparent. He hung upon the man,\nsmiling with white lips; he fawned; he babbled; he cajoled; marshalled\nhis poor defences of tears and smiles, frail defiance and wooing\nsurrender, with an awful, childish cunning. He watched the man as a\nfrightened bird watches a cat; turned as he turned, confronting him with\nevery muscle tense. His high whisper premised a voice too weak with\nterror to shriek. Yet at the entrance of the attendants there came a cry\nthat made Clare shiver where she sat. It was fear incarnate.\n\nClare fidgeted. It was too bad of Louise.... And what had Alwynne been\nthinking of? A free hand, indeed! Too much of a free hand altogether!\nThe fact that she was listening to a piece of acting, that, in a\ntheatre, would have overwhelmed her with admiration, added to her\nannoyance. A school performance was not the place for brilliant\nimproprieties. Certainly impropriety--this laborious exposure of a naked\nemotion was, in such a milieu, essentially improper--Louise must be\ncrazy! And in what unholy school had she learned it all--this baby of\nthirteen? And what on earth would staff and school say?\n\nShe stole a look at her colleagues. Some were interested, she could see,\nbut obviously puzzled. A couple were whispering together. A third had\nchosen the moment to yawn.\n\nHer contradictory mind instantly despised them for fools that could not\nappreciate what manner of work they were privileged to watch. She saw\nher path clear--her attitude outlined for her. She would glorify a\nglorious effort (it was pleasant that for once justice might walk with\nexpediency) and her sure, instant tribute would, she knew, suffice to\nquiet the carpers. But, for all that, the performances themselves should\nbe, she promised herself, on less dangerous lines than the\ndress-rehearsal. She would have a word with Louise: the imp needed a\ncold douche.... But what an actress it would make later on! Clare sighed\nenviously.\n\nThe scene was nearly over. With the glad cry--\"Ah! now you look like\nHubert,\" the enchantment of terror broke. A few more sentences and\nArthur was left alone on the stage.\n\nAs the door clanged (Alwynne was juggling with hardware in the wings)\nthe child's strained attitude relaxed and the audience unconsciously\nrelaxed with it. He swayed a moment, then collapsed brokenly into a\nchair. The long pause was an exquisite relief.\n\nBut before long the small face puckered into frowns; a back-wash of\nsubsiding fear swept across it. The hands twitched and drummed. You felt\nthat a plan was maturing.\n\nAt last, after furtive glances at the door, he rose with an air of\ndecision, and crossed quickly to the alcove of the window. For an\ninstant the curtains hid him, and the audience stared expectantly at an\nempty stage. When he turned to them again, holding the great draperies\napart with little, resolute fists, his face was alight with hope, and,\nfor the first time, wholly youthful. In the soft voice ringing out the\nlast courageous sentences, detailing the plan of the escape, there was a\nlittle quiver of excitement, of childish delight in an adventure. He\nended; stood a moment smiling; then the heavy folds hid him again as\nthey swept into position.\n\nThere was a tense pause.\n\nSuddenly as from a great distance, came a faint wailing cry. Thereon,\nsilence.\n\nThe curtains wheezed and rattled into place.\n\nAlwynne, hurrying on to the stage to shift scenery for the following\nact, nearly tripped, as she dismantled the alcove, over a huddle of\nclothes crouched between backing and wall. She stooped and shook it. A\nsmall arm flung up in instant guard.\n\n\"Louise? Get up! The act's over. Run out of the way. Stop--help me with\nthis, as you're here.\"\n\nObediently the child scrambled to her feet. She gripped an armful of\ncurtain, and trailed across the stage in Alwynne's wake. Till the\ncurtains rose on the final act, she trotted after her meekly, helping\nwhere she could.\n\nWith King John embarked on his opening speech, Alwynne drew breath\nagain. She ran her eye over the actors, palpitant at their several\nentrances, saw the prompter still established with book and lantern, and\ndecided that all could go on without her for a moment. She put her hand\non Louise's shoulder and drew her into the passage.\n\n\"What is it, Louise?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"What were you doing just now? Were you scared? Was it stage fright?\"\n\n\"Oh no.\" Louise smiled faintly.\n\n\"Then what were you doing?\"\n\nLouise considered.\n\n\"I was dead. I had jumped, you know. I was finding out how it would\nfeel.\"\n\n\"Louise! You gruesome child!\"\n\n\"I liked it--it was so quiet. I'd forgotten about shifting the scenery.\nI'm sorry. Does it--did it hurt him, do you think, the falling?\"\n\nAlwynne put both her hands on the thin shoulders and shook her gently.\n\n\"Louise! Wake up! You're not Prince Arthur now! Gracious me, child--it's\nonly a play. You mustn't take it so seriously.\"\n\nLouise made no answer; she did not seem to understand.\n\nAlwynne was struck by a new idea. She took the child's face in her hand\nand turned it to the gaslight.\n\n\"Did I see you at lunch, Louise? I don't believe I did. Do you know\nyou're a very naughty child to take advantage of the confusion?\"\n\n\"Miss Durand, I had to learn. I was forgetting it all. I slipped the\nlast two lines as it was--you know, the 'My uncle's spirit is in these\nstones' bit. I wasn't hungry.\"\n\n\"And you were very late, too. What did you have for breakfast?\"\n\nAn agitated face peered round the corner.\n\n\"Miss Durand, which side do I come on from? Hubert's nearly off.\"\n\n\"The left.\" Alwynne hurried to the rescue, dragging Louise after her.\nShe hustled the anxious courier to his entrance, twitched his mantle\ninto position, and saw him safely on the stage. Then she turned to\nLouise.\n\n\"Louise, will you please go to the kitchen and ask Mrs. Random for two\ncups of tea and some buns--at once. There is some tea made, I know. I'm\ntired and thirsty--two cups, please. Bring it to me here, and don't run\ninto any one with your hands full. Be quick--I'm dying for some.\"\n\nLouise darted away on her errand. Poor Daffy did look hot and\nflustered.... Daffy was such a dear ... every one worried her ... it was\na shame.... Wouldn't Daffy have been a pleasant mother? Better than\nshouting Constance.... What was it she had asked for? A plum, a cherry\nand a fig? No, that wasn't it. Oh, of course, tea--tea and buns.\n\nAlwynne looked after her, smiling and frowning; she was not in the least\nthirsty. What a baby it was.... But nothing to eat all day! Mrs. Denny\nought to be ashamed of herself.... She, Alwynne, would keep a vigilant\neye on her to-morrow, poor little soul.... Had she really lost herself\nso entirely in the part--or was there a touch of pose? No, that was more\nAgatha's line.... Agatha was enjoying herself.... She listened amusedly,\nwatching through a crack in the screen, till a far-away chink caught her\near. She went out again into the passage, and met Louise with a laden\ntray.\n\nAlwynne drank with expressive pantomime and motioned to the other cup.\n\n\"Drink it up,\" she commanded.\n\n\"It's a second cup--for you----\" began Louise.\n\n\"Be a good child and do as you're told! I must fly in a minute.\"\n\nThe child looked doubtful; but the steaming liquid was tempting and the\nnew-baked, shining cakes. She obeyed. Alwynne watched the faint colour\nflush her cheeks with a satisfaction that surprised herself.\n\n\"Finish it all up--d'you hear? I must go.\" She hesitated: \"Louise--you\nwere very good to-day. I am sure Miss Hartill must have been awfully\npleased.\"\n\nShe went back to the stage. She had had the pleasure of bringing a look\nof relief to Louise's face. Alwynne could never remember that the\nkindest lie is a lie none the less.\n\nIn the part of Arthur the child, unconsciously, had seen embodied her\nown psychological situation. She had enacted the spirit, if not the\nletter, of her own state of mind, and in the mock death had experienced\nsomething of the sensations, the sense of release, of a real one. Left\nto herself, she might gradually have dreamed and imagined and acted\nherself out of her troubles, have drifted back to real life again, cured\nand sane. But Alwynne, with her suggestion of good cheer, had destroyed\nthe skin of make-believe that was forming healingly upon the child's\nsore heart. Louise awoke, with a pang of hope, to her real situation.\n\n\"I am sure Miss Hartill must have been awfully pleased.\" ... So pleased\nthat, who knew, she might yet forgive the crime of the examination? If\nit might be.... \"What might be must be,\" cried the child within her.\n\nThere came a crash of clapping; the rehearsal was over at last, and in a\nfew moments flocks of girls, chattering and excited, came trouping past\nLouise on their way to tea.\n\nShe did not follow them. She was suddenly aware of boy's clothes. She\nmust change them.... She could not find Miss Hartill till she was tidy,\nand she had determined to speak with her.\n\nMiss Durand had said.... She would do as Arthur did to Hubert--she would\nbesiege Miss Hartill, force her to be kind, till she could say, \"Oh, now\nyou look Miss Hartill! all this while you were disguised.\" She shivered\nat the idea of undergoing once more the emotional experience of the\nscene--but the vision of Miss Hartill transfigured drew her as a magnet\npulls a needle.\n\nShe went towards the stairs.\n\nThe big music-room at the top of the house had been temporarily\nconverted into a dressing-room, and she thought she would go quickly and\nchange, while it was still quiet and spacious. But as she pushed open\nthe swinging doors that divided staircase from passage, she saw Clare\ncoming down the long corridor. There was no one else in sight. Again\nwild, unreasoning hopes flooded her. She would seize the opportunity ...\nshe would speak to Miss Hartill there and then.... She would ask her why\nshe was always angry.... Perhaps she would be kind? \"I am sure Miss\nHartill must have been awfully pleased....\" She must have speech with\nher at once--at once....\n\nShe waited, holding open the door, her heart beating violently, her face\nsteeled to composure.\n\nClare, passing with a nod, found her way barred by a white-faced scrap\nof humanity, whose courage, obviously and pitifully, was desperation.\nBut Clare could be very blind when she did not choose to see.\n\n\"Miss Hartill, may I speak to you?\"\n\n\"I can't wait, Louise. I'm busy.\"\n\n\"Miss Hartill, was it all right? Were you pleased? I tried furiously.\nWas it as you wanted it?\"\n\n\"Oh, you played your own version.\" Clare caught her up sharply.\n\n\"But Miss Durand said--you said I was to.\"\n\n\"I expect it was all right,\" said Clare lightly. \"I'm afraid I was too\nbusy to attend much, even to your efforts, Louise.\" She smiled\ncrookedly. \"And now run along and change.\"\n\nShe pushed against the door, but Louise, beyond all control, caught back\nthe handles.\n\n\"Miss Hartill--you shall listen. Are you always going to be angry? What\nhave I done? Will you never be good to me again as you used to be?\"\n\nClare's face grew stern.\n\n\"Louise, you are being very silly. Let me pass.\"\n\n\"Because I can't bear it. It's killing me. Couldn't you stop being\nangry?\"\n\nClare, ignoring her, wrenched open the door. Louise, flung sideways,\nslipped on the polished floor. She crouched where she fell, and caught\nat Clare's skirts. She was completely demoralised.\n\n\"Miss Hartill! Oh, please--please--if you would only understand. You\nhurt me so. You hurt me so.\"\n\nClare stood looking down at her.\n\n\"Once and for all, Louise, I dislike scenes. Let me go, please.\"\n\nFor a moment their eyes strove. And suddenly Louise, relaxing all\neffort, let her go. Without another look, Clare retraced her steps and\nentered the Common-room. Louise, still crouching against the wall,\nwatched her till she disappeared. The doors swung and clicked into\nrigidity.\n\nThere was a sudden uproar of voices and laughter and scraping chairs. A\ndistant door had opened.\n\nLouise started to her feet, and sped swiftly up the stairs, flight on\nflight, of the tall old house, till she reached the top floor and the\nmusic-room. It was empty. She flung-to the door, and fumbled with the\nstiff key. It turned at last, and she leaned back against the lock,\nshaking and breathless, but with a sense of relief.\n\nShe was safe.... Not for long--they would be coming up soon--but long\nenough for her purpose.\n\nBut first she must recover breath. It was foolish to tremble so. It only\nhindered one ... when there was so little time to lose.\n\nHurriedly she sorted out her little pile of everyday clothes--some\nirrelevant instinct insisting on the paramount necessity of changing\ninto them. Mrs. Denny would be annoyed if she spoiled the new costume.\nShe re-dressed hastily and, clasping her belt, crossed to the window.\n\nIt was tall and divided into three casements. The centre door was open.\nA low seat ran round the bay. She climbed upon it and stood upright,\npeering out.\n\nHow high up she was! There was a blue haze on the horizon, above the\nline of faint hills, that melted in turn into a weald, chequered like\nthe chessboard counties in _Alice_. So there was a world beyond the\nschool! Nearer still, the suburb spread map-like. She craned forward.\nDirectly under her lay the front garden, and a row of white steps that\ngrinned like teeth. It was on them that she would fall--not on the\ngrass....\n\nShe imagined the sensation of the impact, and shuddered. But at least\nthey would kill one outright.... One would not die groaning in rhymed\ncouplets, like Arthur....\n\nClasping the shafts, she hoisted herself upwards, till she stood upon\nthe inner sill. Instantly the fear of falling caught her by the throat.\nShe swayed backwards, gasping and dizzy, steadying herself against the\nstout curtains.\n\n\"I can't do it,\" whispered Louise hoarsely. \"I can't do it.\"\n\nSlowly the vertigo passed. She fought with her rampant fear, wrenching\naway her thoughts from the terror of the death she had chosen, to the\nterror of the life she was leaving. She stood a space, balanced between\ntime and eternity, weighing them.\n\nWith an effort she straightened herself, and put a foot on the outer\nledge. Again, inevitably, she sickened. Huddled in the safety of the\nwindow-seat, stray phrases thrummed in her head: \"My bones turn to\nwater\"--\"There is no strength in me.\" He knew--that Psalmist man....\n\nShe slipped back on to the floor, and walked unsteadily to the littered\ntable. Her hands were so weak that she could hardly lift them to pour\nout a glass of water.\n\nShe leaned against the table and drank thirstily. What a fool she\nwas.... What a weak fool.... An instant's courage--one little\nsecond--and peace for ever after.... Wasn't it worth while? Wasn't it?\nWasn't it? She turned again to her deliverance.\n\nAs she pulled herself on to the seat, she heard a noise of footsteps in\nthe passage without, and the handle of the door was rattled impatiently.\nIn an instant she was on the sill. This was pursuit--Miss Hartill, and\nall the terrors! There must be no more hesitation. Once more she\ncrouched for the leap, only, with a supreme effort, to swing herself\nback to safety again. Her hands were so slippery with sweat that they\ncould barely grip the window-shafts. There was a banging at the door and\na sound of voices calling. She swayed in a double agony, as fear strove\nagainst fear.\n\nShe heard the voice of a prefect--\n\n\"Who is it in there? Open the door at once.\"\n\nThey would break open the door.... They would find her.... They would\nstop her.... Coward that she was--fool and coward.... One instant's\ncourage--one little movement!\n\nShe stiffened herself anew. Poised on the extreme edge of the outer\nsill, she pushed her two hands through the belt of her dress, lest they\nshould save her in her own despite. She stood an instant, her eyes\nclosed.\n\nThen she sprang....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nClare was enjoying tea and triumph. She had worked hard for both, and\nwas virtuously fatigued. The rocking-chair was comfortable, and the\nlittle gym mistress had brought her her favourite cakes. The\nCommon-room, tinkling its tea-cups, buzzed criticism and approval. The\nrehearsal had been a success.\n\nThe talk centred, while opinion divided, on the Constance and the Prince\nArthur. The general standpoint seemed to be that Agatha had reached the\nheights. Her royal robes had been effective; she reminded nearly every\none of a favourite actress. Louise was less popular. A curious\nperformance--very clever, of course--only one had not thought of Arthur\nquite like that! Now the Constance----\n\nClare, watching and listening, purred like a sleepy cat. She wondered\nwhy Alwynne was absent ... she was missing a lot.... Louise was\nannoying--she had been excessively irritated with her ten minutes\nbefore--and there was the debacle of the scholarship papers--but to\nclass her with Agatha! What fools these women were!\n\nThe discussion had become argument, and was growing faintly acrimonious,\nwhen a deep voice cut across it.\n\nMiss Hamilton, a visiting music mistress, always had a hearing when she\nchose to speak. She was a big woman, with a fine massive head and shrewd\neyes. She dressed tweedily and carried her hands in her pockets,\nslouching a little. It was her harmless vanity to have none. Teaching\nmusic was her business; her recreations, hockey, and the more\nlaw-abiding forms of suffrage agitation. She was a level-headed and\nconvincing speaker, with a triumphant sense of humour that could, and\nhad, carried her successfully through many a fantastic situation.\nRumours of her adventures had spread among the staff, if not through the\nschool, and beglamoured her; she could have had a following if she had\nchosen. But her healthy twelve stone crashed through pedestals, and she\nestablished comradeship, as she helped you, laughter-shaken, to pick up\nthe pieces.\n\nA postponed lesson had given her time to attend the rehearsal, and she\nhad afterwards joined the flock of mistresses at tea. Clare, who thought\nmore of her opinion than she chose to own, had eyed her once or twice\nalready, and at the sound of her voice she stopped her lazy rocking.\n\n\"But they are not in the same category! Any schoolgirl could have played\nConstance as What's-her-name played it, given the training she has had.\"\nMiss Hamilton nodded pleasantly to the rocking-chair. She appreciated\nClare's capacities. \"But Arthur----\"\n\n\"Well, I thought Agatha was splendid,\" repeated a junior mistress\nstubbornly.\n\n\"She was. An excellent piece of work! 'But the hands were the hands of\nEsau.'\"\n\n\"They always are,\" said the little gym mistress fervently.\n\nClare gave her a quick, brilliant smile. She blushed scarlet.\n\nThe music mistress laughed; she enjoyed her weekly glimpse of school\ninterdependencies.\n\n\"Why did you single out _King John_, Miss Hartill?\" she inquired\npolitely.\n\nClare was demure, but her eyes twinkled.\n\n\"The decision lay with Miss Marsham,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Of course. But having a Cinderella on the premises--eh?\"\n\n\"If you know of a glass slipper----\"\n\n\"You fit it on! Exactly! Where did you discover her?\"\n\n\"Starving--literally starving, in the Lower Third.\" Clare thawed to the\ncongenial listener. \"It was an amazing performance, wasn't it? Of\ncourse, there was nothing of the actual Arthur in it----\"\n\nMiss Hamilton nodded.\n\n\"That struck me. It was a child in trouble--not a boy. Not a girl\neither--but, of course, only a girl would be precocious enough to\nconceive and carry out the idea. If she did, that is!\"\n\n\"Oh, it was original,\" Clare disclaimed prettily. \"It had little to do\nwith me. I had to let her go her own way.\"\n\nMiss Hamilton liked her generosity.\n\n\"You're wise. It's all very well to trim the household lamps, but a\nburning bush is best left alone. I don't altogether envy you. Genius\nmust be a disturbing factor in a school.\"\n\n\"You think she has genius?\"\n\n\"It was more than precocity to-day--or talent. The Constance had\ntalent.\"\n\n\"And was third in the scholarship papers. Louise failed completely.\nIsn't it inexplicable? What is one to do? Of course, it was disgraceful:\nshe should have been first. I expected it. I coached her myself. I know\nher possibilities. Frankly, I am deeply disappointed.\"\n\nMiss Hamilton pulled her chair nearer. She was interested; Clare was not\nusually so communicative. But their further conversation was interrupted\nby the opening of the door, and old Miss Marsham appeared on a visit of\ncongratulation, accepting tea and dispensing compliments with equal\nstateliness.\n\n\"An excellent performance! We must felicitate each other--and Miss\nHartill. But we are accustomed to great things from Miss Hartill. There\ncan be no uneasiness to-morrow. The child in the green coat, in that\nscene--ah, you remember? I thought her a trifle indistinct. Perhaps a\nhint----? Altogether it was excellent. Especially the Constance--most\ndramatic. If I may criticise--acting is not my department--but the\nPrince Arthur? Now, were you satisfied? Louise is a dear child, but\nhardly suitable, eh?\"\n\nClare stiffened.\n\n\"I thought her acting remarkable.\"\n\n\"Did you? Now I can't help feeling that Shakespeare never intended it\nlike that. He makes him such a dear little boy. It's so pathetic, you\nknow, where he begs the man not to put out his eyes. So childlike and\ntouching. Like little Lord Fauntleroy. I know I cried when I saw it,\nyears ago. Now this child was not at all appealing.\"\n\nClare shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"It is not a pretty scene, Miss Marsham, though the managers conspire to\nmake us think so. A child at the mercy of brutes, knowing its own\ndanger, terrorised into the extreme of cunning, parading its poor little\ngraces with the skill of a mondaine--it's not pretty! And Louise spared\nus nothing.\"\n\nMiss Marsham fidgeted.\n\n\"If that is your view of the scene, Miss Hartill, I wonder that you\nconsider it fit for a school performance.\"\n\nClare hedged.\n\n\"My private view doesn't matter, after all. Traditionally it is\ninadmissible, of course. But if you would like the treatment altered a\nlittle, I will speak to Louise. It is only the dress rehearsal, of\ncourse.\"\n\nMiss Marsham looked relieved.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be better. A little more childlike, you know. But\ndon't let her think me annoyed, Miss Hartill; I am sure she has worked\nso hard. Just a hint, you know. I should not like her feelings to be\nhurt. Poor child, the results were a sad disappointment to her, I'm\nafraid. You spoke to her about the change of class?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I hope she was not distressed?\"\n\nClare remembered the look on Louise's face. She hesitated.\n\n\"She will get over it,\" she said.\n\nThe kind old woman looked worried.\n\n\"You must not let her feel that she has failed over this, Miss\nHartill--on the top of the other trouble. You will be judicious?\"\n\nA door slammed in the distance; there was a blurr of voices, a sound of\nhurrying footsteps.\n\nClare rose impatiently; she was tired of the subject.\n\n\"It will be all right, Miss Marsham. I understand Louise. What in the\nworld is that disgraceful noise?\"\n\nBut the door was flung open before she could reach it. Alwynne stood in\nthe aperture, panting a little. In her arms lay Louise, her head falling\nlimply, like a dead bird's. Behind them, peering faces showed for a\nmoment, white against the dusk of the passage. Then Alwynne, staggering\nbeneath the dead weight, stumbled forward, and the door swung to with a\ncrash.\n\nThe roomful of women stared in horrified silence.\n\n\"She's dead,\" said Alwynne. \"I found her on the steps. She fell from a\nwindow. One of the children saw it. She's dead.\"\n\nShe swayed forward to the empty rocking-chair, and sat down, the child's\nbody clasped to her breast. She looked like a young mother.\n\nClare, watching half stupified, saw a thin trickle of blood run out\nacross her bare arm.\n\nIt woke her.\n\n\"Send for a doctor!\" screamed Clare. \"Send for a doctor! Will nobody\nsend for a doctor?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nThe sudden death of Louise Denny had shocked, each in her degree, every\nmember of the staff. The general view was that such a deplorable\naccident could and should have been impossible. Every one remembered\nhaving long ago thought that the old-fashioned windows were unsafe, and\nhaving wondered why precautions had never been taken. Every one, the\nfirst horror over, canvassed the result of the unavoidable inquest, and\nspeculated whether any one would be censured for carelessness. The\nyounger mistresses were so sure that it was nobody's business to be on\nduty in the dressing-room at that particular hour that they spent the\nrest of the hushed, horror-stricken day in telling each other so,\nproclaiming, a trifle too insistently, their relief that they at least\nhad nothing, however remote, to do with the affair: while inwardly they\nransacked their memories to recall if perchance some half-heard order,\nsome forgotten promise of standing substitute or relieving guard could,\nat the last moment, implicate them.\n\nBut the task of quieting and occupying the frightened children, and of\nclearing away, as far as might be, all traces of the dress rehearsal,\nwas at least distraction. On the heads of the school, real and nominal,\nthe strain was immeasurably greater. It was first truly felt, indeed,\nmany hours later. Old Miss Marsham, in whom the shock had awakened\nsomething of her old-time decision of character, had conducted the\ninterview with the decorously grieving parents with sufficient dignity;\nhad overseen the temporary resting-place of the dead child; had\ncommunicated with doctors, lawyers and officials. But the spurt of\nenergy had subsided with the necessity for it. She had retired late at\nnight to her own apartments and the ministrations of her efficient\nmaid, a broken old commander, facing tremulously the calamity that had\nbefallen her life-work: foreseeing and exaggerating its effect on the\nfuture of the school, planning feverishly her defence from the gossip\nthat must ensue. An accident ... of course, an accident ... a terrible\nyet unforeseeable accident.... That was the point.... At all costs it\nmust be shown that it was an accident pure and simple, with never a\nwhisper of negligence against authority or underling.... But she was an\nold woman.... She needed, she supposed bitterly, a shock of this kind to\nhumble her into realising that her day was over.... She had been driving\nwith slack reins this many a long year.... She had known it and had\nhoped that no one shared her knowledge. And none had known.... So there\ncame this pitiful occurrence to advertise her weakness to the world....\nThe poor child! Ah, the poor little child! There had been a lack of\nsupervision, no doubt ... some such gross carelessness as she, in her\nheyday, would never have tolerated.... And she was grown too old, too\nfeeble to hold enquiry--to dispense strict justice.... She must depend\non the lieutenants who had failed her, to hush the matter up--to make\nthe administration of the school appear blameless.... They could do\nthat, she did not doubt, and so she must be content.... But in the day\nof her strength she would not have been content.... But she was old....\nIt was time for her to abdicate.... She must put her affairs in order,\nname her successor--Clare Hartill or the secretary, she supposed....\nThey knew her ways.... There was that bright girl who had faced her\nto-day with the little child in her arms ... what was her name? Daughter\nor niece of some old pupil of her own.... She could more easily have\nseen her in her seat than either of her vice-regents.... So young and\nstrong and eager.... She had been like that once.... Now she was a weak\nold woman, and because of her weakness a little child lay dead in her\nhouse.... Yes, Martha might put her to bed.... Why not? She was very\ntired.\n\nHenrietta Vigers had also her anxieties. She had so long claimed the\nposition of virtual head that there was no doubt in her own mind that\nother people would consider her as responsible as if she had been the\nactual one. She worried incessantly. Should she have had bars put up to\nthose old-fashioned windows? She, who was responsible for all the\nhousehold arrangements? Ought she not to have foreseen the danger and\nguarded against it? And there was the matter of the dressing-room\nmistress.... For the school machinery she had made herself even more\npointedly responsible.... She should have arranged for some one to\noversee the children.... But the dressing-room had been a temporary one\nand she had overlooked the necessity.... Yet if some one had been in the\nroom the accident could impossibly have happened.... She felt that she\nwould be lucky to escape public censure, that loss of prestige in the\neyes at least of the head mistress was inevitable.\n\nBut the more or less selfish perturbation, as distinct from the emotion\nof sheer humanity, that was aroused by the death of the little\nschoolgirl in the two older women, was as nothing to the sensation of\nsick dismay that it awoke in Clare Hartill. She, too, through the night\nthat followed on the accident, lay awake till sunrise, considering her\nposition. She was stunned by the unexpectedness of the catastrophe; a\nlittle grieved for the loss of Louise, but, above all, intensely and\nquite selfishly frightened. She felt guilty. She remembered,\nremorselessly enlightened, the afternoon, the expression in Louise's\neyes, and not for one instant did she share the general belief in the\naccidental nature of her death. Her conscience would not allow her the\ncomfort of such self-deception. Later she might lull it to sleep again,\nbut for the moment it was awake, and her master. This same keen-witted\nconscience of hers, this quintessence of her secret admirations and\nconsidered opinions, her epicurean appreciation of what was guileless\nand beautiful and worthy, co-existing, as it did, with the\nintellectualised sensuality of her imperious and carnal personality, was\nno small trial to Clare. Though it could not sway her decisions nor\ninfluence her actions by one hair's-breadth, it was at least cynically\nactive, as now, to prick and fret at her peace. It was, indeed, at the\nroot of the whimsical irritability that, for all her charm, made her an\nimpossible housemate.\n\nEssentially, her attitude to life was simple. It was an orange, to be\nsqueezed for her pleasure. It must serve her; but she owed it,\ntherefore, no duty. She found that she achieved a maximum of pleasurable\nsensations by following the dictates of that mind which is the\nmouthpiece of body, while indulging, as Lucullus ate turnips, in austere\nflirtations with that other mind, which is the mouthpiece of spirit. So\nshe served Mammon, or rather, she allowed Mammon to serve her, but she\nwas, on occasions, critically interested in God. And this was her\nundoing. Could she have been content to be frankly selfish, she might\nhave been happy enough, but her very interest in the kingdom of Heaven\nhad created her conscience, and had laid her open to its attacks. She\nignored it, and it made her wretched: she compromised with it, and\nbecame a hypocrite.\n\nShe resented the death of Louise because it challenged her whole scheme\nof life. She was furiously angry with the dead child for what she felt\nto be an indictment of her legitimate amusements. Louise, so meek and\nineffectual, had yet been able to steal a march on her, had stabbed in\nthe back and run away, beyond reach of Clare's retaliation.... Louise\nhad fooled her.... She, Clare, proud of her insight, her complete\nknowledge of character, her alert intuition, had yet had no inkling of\nwhat was passing in that childish mind.... If she had guessed, however\nvaguely, she could have taken measures, have scourged the mere\nsuggestion of such monstrous rebellion out of that subject soul.... But\nLouise, secure in her insignificance, had tricked her, planned her sure\nescape.... But how unhappy she must have been!...\n\nIn a sudden revulsion of feeling Clare grew faint with pity, as she\ntried to realise the child's state of mind during the past months. Her\nthoughts went back to the Christmas Day they had spent together. She had\nbeen happy enough then.... Half sincerely she tried to puzzle out the\nchange in Louise, the gradual deterioration that had led to the tragedy.\nHad she been to blame? Louise had grown tiresome, and she had snubbed\nher.... There was the thing in a nutshell.... If she was to be so tender\nof the feelings of all the silly girls who sentimentalised over her,\nwhere would it end, at all?\n\nPoor little Louise.... She had been really fond of her at the\nbeginning.... She had thought for a time that she might even supplant\nAlwynne.... But Louise had disappointed her.... She had let her work go\nto the dogs.... All her originality and charm fizzled out.... She had\nceased to be interesting.... And she, Clare, had naturally been bored\nand had shown it.... Why couldn't the child take it quietly? If Louise\nhad only known--and had conducted herself with tact--Clare had been\npreparing to be nicer to her again.... She had been deeply interested in\nher performance of the morning, had recognised its uncanny\nsincerity--had thought, with a distinct quickening of interest, that\nLouise was recovering herself at last, and that it might be as well to\ntake her in hand again.... Oh, she had been full of benevolent impulses!\nBut then Louise had been tiresome again ... had stopped her and made a\nscene.... She hated scenes ... at least (with a laugh) scenes that were\nnot of her own devising....\n\nShe supposed she should have recognised that the child was\noverwrought--terribly overwrought by the emotions aroused by such an\ninterpretation as she had insisted upon giving.... She ought never to\nhave been allowed to play it like that.... That was Alwynne's doing....\nAlwynne had persuaded Clare to leave Louise to her own devices....\nAlwynne was so headstrong.... She hoped that Alwynne would never need to\nrealise how much she was to blame....\n\nHere she became aware that her conscience was convulsed with cynical\nlaughter. She flushed in the darkness, her opportune sense of injury\nincreasing.\n\nAlwynne might well be distressed.... If any awkward questions should be\nasked, Alwynne might find herself uncomfortably placed.... People would\nwonder that she had not noticed how unbalanced Louise was growing....\nEvery one knew how intimate, how ridiculously intimate, she and Louise\nhad become.... Alwynne had fussed over her like an old hen ... had even\non occasion questioned her, Clare's, method with her.... She must have\nknown what was in Louise's mind.... Yet Clare had no doubt that people\nwould be only too ready to accuse her, rather than Alwynne, of criminal\nobtuseness.... Henrietta Vigers, for instance.... Henrietta would be\nless prejudiced than many others, though.... She was no friend to\nAlwynne.... It might do no harm to talk over the matter with Henrietta\nVigers.... A word or two would be enough....\n\nOf course it would be considered an accident.... But if by any chance,\nvague suspicions were rife, a judicious talk with Henrietta would have\nserved, at least, to prevent Clare from being made their object.... She\nhad her enemies, she knew.... Alwynne, with her easy popularity, had\nnone save Henrietta.... A few waspish remarks from Henrietta would not\nhurt Alwynne.... Clare would protect Alwynne from serious annoyance, of\ncourse.... If the mistresses--the school--oh, if the whole world turned\nagainst Alwynne, Clare would make it up to her.... What did Alwynne\nwant, after all, with any one but Clare? The less the world gave\nAlwynne, the more she would be content with Clare, the more entirely she\nwould be Clare's own property.... It was a good idea.... She would\ncertainly speak to Miss Vigers....\n\nShe was outlining that conversation till she fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nOn the following afternoon Clare and Henrietta were sitting together in\nthe mistresses' room. The afternoon classes were over and the day pupils\nand mistresses had gone home. The boarders were at supper and the staff\nwith them.\n\nBut Henrietta had taken no notice of the supper-hour. She had more work\nin hand than she could well compass--letters to write and answer, of\nexplanation, and enquiry, and condolence. She could have found time for\nher supper, nevertheless, but when she was overworked she liked her\nworld to be aware of it. Clare, contrary to her custom, had stayed late.\nShe was waiting for Alwynne. She had offered, perfunctorily enough, her\nassistance, but Henrietta had refused all help from her. Yet Henrietta\nhad turned over the bulk of her formal correspondence to Alwynne, who\nsat, hard at work, in the adjacent office. She disliked Alwynne, but\naccepted the very necessary help from her more easily than from Clare\nHartill. Yet she was softened by Clare's offer, which she had refused,\nand not at all grateful for Alwynne's help, though she accepted it.\n\nShe wrote busily for more than an hour, and Clare, silent, scarcely\nmoving, sat watching her. Henrietta had, for once, no feeling of\nimpatience at her idle supervision. She did not experience her usual\nsensation of intimidated antagonism. It was as if the stress of the last\ntwenty-four hours had temporarily atoned the two incongruous characters.\nNeither by look or gesture had Clare flouted any suggestion or\narrangement of Henrietta's--indeed, her presence had been quite\ndistinctly a support. Henrietta had appealed more than once, and even\nconfidently, to her. Henrietta had thought, with a touch of\ncompunction, how strangely trouble brought out the best in people. Miss\nHartill had been very proud of Louise Denny; evidently felt her death.\nThe shock was causing her to unbend. Not, as one would have expected, to\nAlwynne Durand--she hoped, by the way, that Miss Durand was addressing\nthose envelopes legibly: she did so dislike an explosive\nhandwriting--no, Miss Hartill was turning, very properly, to herself in\nthe emergency.... She was pleased.... There should be free-masonry\nbetween the heads of the school.... And Clare Hartill, for all her lazy\nindifference, was influential and enormously capable.... Henrietta\nwondered if it would be safe to consult her.... She might, without\nacknowledging a definite uneasiness, find out cautiously whether it had\noccurred to Miss Hartill that she, Henrietta, might be considered to\nhave been negligent.\n\nShe glanced across at her inscrutable colleague. Clare was staring\nthoughtfully at her. Her lips were puffed a little, as if in doubt.\n\nTheir eyes met for a moment in a glance that was almost one of\nunderstanding.\n\nHenrietta hesitated, for the first time not at all disconcerted by\nClare's direct gaze. But the sparkle of gay malice that attracted half\nher world, and disconcerted the other half, was gone from Clare's eyes.\nTheir expression, for the time being, was calm, possibly friendly; at\nany rate, irreproachably matter-of-fact.\n\nHenrietta flung down her pen with a sigh of fatigue, and bent and unbent\nher cramped fingers. But it was not fatigue that made her stop work. She\nwanted to talk to Clare Hartill, and had a queer conviction that Clare\nHartill wanted to talk to her.\n\n\"Finished?\" Clare spoke from the shadow of her deep chair. Her back was\nto the light, but Henrietta faced the west window. The evening sun laid\nbare her face for Clare's inspection. Not a flicker of expression could\nescape her, if she chose to look.\n\n\"More or less. I want half-an-hour's rest.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. You've had everything to see to.\" Clare's voice was\ndelicately sympathetic.\n\nHenrietta unbent.\n\n\"A secretary's work isn't showy, Miss Hartill, but it's necessary: and\nany happening that's out of the common doubles it. The correspondence\nover this unhappy affair alone----\"\n\n\"I know. Of course, at Miss Marsham's age----\"\n\n\"It all falls on me! People don't realise that. The extra work is\nenormous. Miss Marsham depends on me so entirely, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured Clare appreciatively.\n\nHenrietta played with her papers.\n\n\"I feel the responsibility very strongly,\" she said abruptly; but her\ntone was confidential.\n\nClare nodded.\n\n\"Yet, of course--as far as nominal responsibility goes--I am not the\nhead of the school. I cannot be held responsible--any oversight----\"\n\nClare nodded.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Vigers--you merely carry out instructions, like the rest of\nus\"--she hesitated imperceptibly--\"officially,\" she added slowly.\n\nHenrietta looked relieved.\n\n\"I am so glad you see what I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do, entirely,\" Clare assured her grimly.\n\n\"I'm not heartless,\" said Henrietta suddenly, flushing. Her tone\njustified herself against unuttered criticism. \"And the poor child's\ndeath was as much a shock to me as to any one. But I was not fond of\nher--as you were, for instance----\"\n\nClare's pose never altered.\n\n\"I was very proud of her,\" she said gently. \"I thought her an\nexceptional child. But, as Miss Durand said to me only a few days ago--I\ndidn't really know her: not, at least, as she did. Alwynne, I know,\nthinks we have lost a genius. But you're right--it was a shock to me--a\nterrible shock.\"\n\n\"It was that to everybody, naturally. But in a way it's curious,\" said\nHenrietta meditatively, \"how much we all feel it--how oppressively, at\nleast: for I don't think any one was very fond of Louise.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Durand was deeply attached to her,\" Clare protested, her\nbeautiful voice low with emotion.\n\n\"Yes, of course! Oh, I've noticed that.\" Clare's unusual accessibility\nmade Henrietta anxious to agree. Also, though she had noticed nothing\nunusual, she did not wish to appear lacking in penetration. She recalled\nAlwynne's haggard face; recollected how much she had had to do with the\nchild; and decided that Clare was probably right.\n\n\"But except for her,\" she went on, \"and your interest in her----\"\n\n\"I've never had such a pupil,\" said Clare calmly.\n\"Industrious--original--oh, I shall miss her, I know. But you're\nright--she was not popular----\"\n\n\"Yet everybody feels her death--among ourselves, I mean--to an\nextraordinary degree. After all--an accident is only an accident,\nhowever dreadful! But there's a sort of oppression on us--a kind of\nfear. Do you know what I mean? I think we all feel it. It draws us\ntogether in a curious way.\"\n\n\"'The Tie of Common Funk,'\" rapped out Clare, forgetting her r\u00c3\u00b4le.\n\nHenrietta stiffened.\n\n\"I don't think it is an occasion for slang,\" she said. \"The child's not\nburied yet.\"\n\nClare bit back a flippancy.\n\n\"I thought you would realise,\" continued Henrietta severely, \"that the\nsituation is trying for us all----\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\" Clare hastened to soothe her. \"But seriously, Miss\nVigers, I do not think you need be anxious. The inquest--oh, a painful\nordeal, if you like. But you, at least, can have no reason to reproach\nyourself.\"\n\nHenrietta relaxed again.\n\n\"No! As I say, I'm not the head of the school. I'm not responsible for\nregulations--only for carrying them out. And accidents will happen.\"\n\n\"I only hope,\" said Clare, as if to herself, \"that it will be considered\nan accident----\"\n\nHenrietta stared.\n\n\"But Miss Hartill! Of course it was an accident!\"\n\nClare looked at her wistfully.\n\n\"Yes! It was, wasn't it? Yes, of course! It must have been an accident.\"\nHer tone dismissed the matter.\n\nBut Henrietta was on the alert. Her own anxieties had been skilfully\nallayed. Her mind was recovering poise. She nosed a mystery and her\nreviving sense of importance insisted on sharing the knowledge of it.\n\n\"Miss Hartill--you are not suggesting----?\" Her tone invited confidence.\n\nClare gave a little natural laugh.\n\n\"Oh, my dear woman--I'm all nerves just at present. Of course I'm not\nsuggesting anything. One gets absurd ideas into one's head. I'm only too\nrelieved to hear you laugh at me. Your common sense is always a real\nsupport to me, you know. I've grown to depend on it all these years. I'm\nafraid I've got into the way of taking it too much for granted.\"\n\nShe gave a charming little deprecatory shrug.\n\nHenrietta flushed: she felt herself warming unaccountably to Clare\nHartill. She wondered why she had never before taken the trouble to draw\nher out.... She was evidently a woman of heart as well as brain. She\nfelt vaguely that she must constantly have been unjust to her. But these\nsensations only whetted her eager curiosity. She pulled in her chair to\nthe hearth.\n\n\"But what ideas, Miss Hartill? If you will tell me--I should be the last\nperson to laugh. I have far too much respect for--I wish you would tell\nme what is worrying you. Does anything make you think it was not an\naccident?\"\n\nClare was the picture of reluctance.\n\n\"Impressions--vague ideas--is it fair to formulate them? Even if Louise\nwere unbalanced--but, of course, I did not see much of her out of class.\nI confess I thought her manner strained at times. But I teach. I have\nnothing to do with the supervision of the younger children.\"\n\n\"That is Miss Durand's business,\" remarked Henrietta crisply.\n\n\"Oh, but if she had noticed anything----\" began Clare. Then, lamely,\n\"Obviously she didn't----\"\n\n\"It was her business to. She should have reported to me. Why, she\ncoached Louise, didn't she?\"\n\n\"Of course, if Louise had really overworked--badly----\" reflected Clare,\nwith the distressed air of one on whom unwelcome ideas are dawning. \"One\nhears of cases--in Germany--but it's impossible!\"\n\nHenrietta looked genuinely shocked, but none the less she was excited.\n\n\"She failed in that exam.----\" she adduced.\n\n\"Yes! Miss Durand coached her for that, you know. Poor Miss Durand! How\nshe slaved over her! She was dreadfully disappointed,\" said Clare\nindulgently.\n\n\"Of course, she let her overdo herself!\" cried Henrietta triumphantly.\n\"But you coached her too--didn't you notice either?\"\n\n\"I coach the whole class. You know how busy I am. I'm afraid I left\nLouise a good deal to Alwynne,\" said Clare regretfully.\n\n\"But she's supposed to be grown up--an asset to the school, according to\nMiss Marsham,\" said Henrietta tartly. \"But, I must say, if she couldn't\nsee that the child was doing too much, she's not fit to teach----\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" cried Clare, distressed. \"You mustn't say such things.\nYou've no idea how conscientious Alwynne is. She may have worked Louise\ntoo hard--but with the best intentions. She would be heartbroken if you\nsuggested it.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are always very lenient to Miss Durand,\" began Henrietta, with\na touch of jealousy.\n\n\"Ah! She's so young! So full of the zeal of youth. Besides, I'm\nvery fond of her.\" Clare's smile took Henrietta into her\nconfidence--confessed to an amiable weakness.\n\nHenrietta brooded.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Hartill, you talk of my common sense. I wish--I wish you could\nsee Miss Durand from my point of view for a moment.\" She eyed Clare,\nattentive and plastic in her shadows, and took courage.\n\"This--appalling--probability----\"\n\n\"Possibility----\" Clare deprecated.\n\n\"Oh, but it seems terribly probable to me--only carries on my idea of\nMiss Durand. She is so ignorant--so inexperienced--so undisciplined--she\ncannot possibly have a good influence on young children----\"\n\n\"She is my friend!\" Clare reminded her, with gentle dignity.\n\n\"And if your suspicions are correct--if Louise's death were not\naccidental--if it had anything to do with her state of mind--if it were\nthe effect of overwork--I consider--I must consider Miss Durand in some\nmeasure responsible. I feel that Miss Marsham should be told.\"\n\nClare shook her head. Her solemn, candid eyes abashed Henrietta.\n\n\"Miss Vigers--we are speaking in confidence. I should never forgive\nmyself if anything I've said to you were repeated.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course!\" Henrietta appeased her hastily. \"But I've had my\nown suspicions--oh, for a long time, I assure you. I've not been blind.\nAnd I might feel it my duty--on my account, you understand--after all\nMiss Marsham depends on me implicitly--to speak to her--for the sake of\nthe school----\"\n\nClare considered.\n\n\"That, of course--I can't prevent. But Miss Vigers--forgive\nme--but--don't let your sense of responsibility make you unfair. And for\nheaven's sake, don't let my vague uneasiness--it's really nothing\nmore--affect your judgment. We may both be utterly mistaken. I am sure\nthe result of the inquest will prove us mistaken after all--it will be\nfound to have been an accident.\"\n\nHenrietta closed her lips obstinately.\n\nClare rose in her place.\n\n\"It was an accident!\" she cried passionately. \"In my heart I am sure. I\nwish I'd never said anything to you. I'd no right to be suspicious.\nThink of what Miss Durand's feelings would be if she realised----\" She\nflung out her hands appealingly. \"Oh, we're two overwrought women,\naren't we? Sitting in the dusk and scaring ourselves with bogies. It was\nan accident, Miss Vigers--a tragic accident! Make yourself think so!\nMake me think so too!\" Her beautiful eyes implored comfort.\n\nHenrietta, quite touched, patted her awkwardly on the arm. She enjoyed\nher transient superiority.\n\n\"Of course, of course, we'll try to think so. Now you must go home. You\nare quite overwrought. It will be a trying day for us all to-morrow. I\nshall go to bed early too. Won't you go home now?\"\n\nClare nodded, mute, grateful. She went to her peg, and took down her hat\nand jacket.\n\n\"Have you finished with Miss Durand? She was going home with me.\"\n\n\"Oh! Miss Durand!\" Henrietta's tone grew crisper. \"Yes, of course. I'll\nsee if she has done. I'll send her to you. And you mustn't let yourself\nworry, Miss Hartill. Leave it all to me. These things are more my\nprovince. Good-night!\" said Henrietta cordially.\n\nShe left the room.\n\nClare, pinning on her hat, stared critically at herself in the\ninadequate mirror.\n\n\"I think,\" she said confidentially, \"we did that rather well.\"\n\nShe smiled. The cynical lips smiled back at her.\n\n\"You beast!\" cried Clare, with sudden passion. \"You beast! You beast!\"\n\nShe was still staring at herself when Alwynne came for her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nClare Hartill's precautions proved to be unnecessary as the alarms of\nher colleagues. The inquest was a formal and quickly concluded affair,\nand the only corollary to the verdict of accidental death was an\nexpression of sympathy with all concerned.\n\nWhereon, there being no further cause for the detaining of Louise Denny\nabove ground, she was elegantly and expeditiously buried.\n\nThe whole school attended the funeral. The flowers required a second\ncarriage, and for the first time in his life, Mr. Denny was genuinely\nproud of his daughter. He did not believe that his own death could have\nextracted more lavish tributes from the purses of his acquaintances.\n\nClare Hartill, writing a card for her wreath of incredible orchids, did\nnot regret her extravagance. After all--one must keep up one's\nposition.... There would certainly not be such another wreath in the\nchurchyard.... How Louise would have exclaimed over it! Poor child....\nIt was all one could do for her now. Clare hesitated, pen\narrested--\"With deepest sympathy.\" It was not necessary to write\nanything more.... Her name was printed already.... But Louise would have\nliked a message.... After all, she had been very proud of Louise....\n\nShe reversed the card, and wrote, almost illegibly, in a corner,\n\"Louise--with love. C. H.\" She paused, lips pursed. Sentimental,\nperhaps? Possibly.... But let it go....\n\nHastily she impaled her card on its attendant pin, and thrust it, print\nupward, among the flowers. The message was for Louise; no one else need\nsee it.\n\nAlwynne, too, sent flowers. But as usual she had spent all but a\nfraction of her salary. Seven and sixpence does not make a show, even if\nthe garland be home-made. The shabby wreath was forgotten among the\ncrowd of hot-house blooms. It lay in a corner till the day after the\nfuneral. Then the housemaid threw it away.\n\nSo Louise had no message from Alwynne.\n\nBy the end of a fortnight Louise was barely a memory in the school. A\nmonth had obliterated her entirely.\n\nYet her short career and sudden death had its influence on school and\nindividual alike. Miss Marsham had had her lesson; she began to make her\npreliminary preparations for giving up her head mistress-ship, and\nselling her interest in the school; though it was the following spring\nbefore she began to negotiate definitely with Clare, on whom her choice\nhad finally fallen. She would not be hurried; she would not appear\nanxious to settle her affairs; but she had determined, between regret\nand relief, that the next summer should be the last of her reign.\n\nHenrietta, though her anxieties were abated by the turn affairs had\ntaken, was still doubtful whether Miss Marsham were as blindly reliant\nupon her as usual. But, though feeling her position still somewhat\ninsecure, her spirits had risen, and her natural love of interference\nhad risen with them. She could not forget her conversation with Miss\nHartill: an amazing conversation--a conversation teeming with\nsuggestions and possibilities.... Of course, Miss Hartill had had no\nidea, poor distracted woman, of how skilfully Henrietta had drawn her\nout.... Henrietta felt pleased with herself. Without once referring to\nMiss Hartill, she could follow out her own plans as far as Miss Durand\nwas concerned.... Later, Miss Hartill might remember that apparently\ninnocent conversation and realise that Henrietta had stolen a march on\nher.... Yet, though she might be loyally angry, for her friend's sake,\nshe could not do anything to cross Henrietta's arrangements ... could\nnot wish to do anything, because essentially, if reluctantly, she had\napproved them, had recognised that it was time to curtail Miss Durand's\nactivities....\n\nHenrietta felt virtuous. Miss Durand had brought it on herself.... She\nwished her no harm.... But it was right that Marsham should realise how\nfar she was from an ideal school-mistress.... She had been engaged as\nscholastic maid-of-all-work.... Yet in a few terms she had become second\nonly to Miss Hartill herself.... It was not fit.... Let her go back to\nher beginnings.... She, Henrietta, had only to open Miss Marsham's\neyes.... But to that end there must be evidence....\n\nFor the rest of the term, patient and peering as a rag-picker, she went\nabout collecting her evidence.\n\nClare did not give another thought to her conversation with the\ngimlet-eyed secretary. It had served its purpose--had been a barrier\nbetween herself and the possibility of attack--had given her a feeling\nof security. She perceived, nevertheless, that her transient affability\nhad made Henrietta violently her adherent. Clare was resigned to knowing\nthat the change of face would be temporary--she could not allow a\nparading of herself as an intimate, and thither, she shrewdly suspected,\nwould Henrietta's amenities lead. But she found it amusing to be\ngracious, as long as no more was expected of her. She did not like\nHenrietta one whit the better; felt herself, indeed, degraded by the\nexpedient to which she had resorted, and fiercely despised her tool.\nHenrietta should be given rope, might attack Alwynne unhindered,\nnevertheless she should hang herself at the last.... Clare would ensure\nthat.... Once--Henrietta had called her a cat.... Oh, she had heard of\nit! Well--for the present, she would purr to Henrietta, blank-eyed,\nclaws sheathed.... Let her serve her turn.\n\nBut Clare, beneath her schemes and jealousies, was, nevertheless, deeply\nand sincerely unhappy. The removal of the entirely selfish and\ncold-blooded panic that had been upon her since Louise's death, left her\nfree to entertain deeper and sincerer feelings. She thought of Louise\nincessantly, with a growing feeling of regret and responsibility. She\nhated responsibility, though she loved authority--she had always shut\nher eyes to the effects of her caprices. But the more she thought of\nLouise, the more insistent grew her qualms. That the child was dead of\nits own will, she never doubted; but she fought desperately against the\nsuggestion that her own conduct could have affected its state of mind,\nwas ready to accept the most preposterous premise, whose ensuing chain\nof reasoning could acquit her. But nobody having accused her, no\ningenuity of herself or another, could, for the time being, acquit her.\nShe was merely a prey to her own intangible uneasinesses. Yet it needed\nbut a key to set the whole machinery of her conscience in motion against\nher. The key was to be found.\n\nThe term was drawing to an end, and Alwynne, rounding off her special\nclasses and generally making up arrears, was proportionately busy. She\nstill spent her week-ends with Clare, but she brought her work along\nwith her. She had her corner of the table, and Clare her desk, and the\ntwo would work till the small hours.\n\nBut by the last Sunday evening, Clare's piles of reports and examination\npapers had disappeared, and she was free to lie at ease on her sofa, and\nto laugh at Alwynne, still immersed in exercise books, and tantalise her\nwith airy plans for the long, delicious holidays. It had been, in spite\nof the season, a day of rain and cold winds. The skies had cleared at\nthe sunset, with its red promise of fine weather once more, but the\nremnant of a fire still smouldered on the hearth. Alwynne was flushed\nwith the interest of her work, but ever and again Clare shivered, and\npulled the quilted sofa-wrap more closely about her. She wished that\nAlwynne would be quick.... Surely Alwynne could finish off her work some\nother time.... It wouldn't hurt her to get up early for once, for that\nmatter.... She was bored.... She was dull.... She wanted amusement....\nShe wanted Alwynne, and attention, and affection, and a little\nbutterfly kiss or two.... Alwynne ought to be awake to the fact that she\nwas wanted....\n\nShe watched her, between fretfulness and affection, \u00c3\u00a6sthetically\nappreciative of the big young body in the lavender frock, and the crown\nof shining hair, pleased with her property, intensely impatient of its\ninterest in anything but herself.\n\n\"Alwynne----?\" There was a hint of neglect in her voice.\n\nAlwynne beamed, but her eyes were abstracted.\n\n\"Only another half-hour, Clare. I must just finish these. You don't\nmind, do you?\"\n\n\"I? Mind?\" Clare laughed elaborately. She picked up a book, and there\nwas silence once more.\n\nLeaves fluttered and a pen scraped. The light began to fade.\n\nSuddenly Alwynne gave a smothered exclamation. Clare looked up and\npulled herself upright, angry enough.\n\n\"Alwynne! Your carelessness--you've dropped your wet pen on my carpet.\nIt's too bad.\"\n\nAlwynne groped hastily beneath the table. But even the prolonged\nstooping had not brought back the colour to her cheek, as she replaced\nher pen on the stand.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I was startled. It hasn't marked it. Clare--just listen to\nthis.\"\n\n\"What have you got hold of?\" demanded Clare irritably. She disliked\nspots and spillings and mess, as Alwynne might know.\n\n\"It's Louise's composition book. I always wondered where it had got to,\nwhen I cleared out her desk. It must have lain about and got collected\nin with the rest, yesterday.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Clare, with a show of indifference.\n\n\"Here's that essay on King John and his times. Do you remember? You gave\nit to them to do just before the play. It's not corrected. Not\nfinished.\" She hesitated. \"Clare! It's rather queer.\"\n\n\"Is it any good?\" said Clare meditatively.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"The School Magazine. We're short of copy. The child wrote well. But I\nsuppose it wouldn't do to use it--though I don't see why not.\"\n\nSuddenly Alwynne began to read aloud.\n\n     \"_Another way by which King John got money from the Jews was by\n     threatening them with torture. He was all-powerful. He could draw\n     their teeth, tooth by tooth, twist their thumbs, or leave them to\n     rot in dark, silent prisons. They could not do anything against\n     him. If he could not force them to yield up their treasure he would\n     have them burned, or cause them to be pressed to death. This is a\n     horrible torture. I read about a woman who was killed in this way\n     in the 'Hundred Best Books'; and there was a man in Good King\n     Charles's days whom they killed like this. It is the worst death of\n     any. They tie you down, so that you cannot move at all, and there\n     is a slab of stone that hangs a little above you. This sinks very\n     slowly, so that all the first day you just lie and stare at it and\n     wonder if it really moves. People come and give you food and laugh\n     at you. You are scarcely afraid, because it moves so little and you\n     think nobody could be really so cruel and hurt you so horribly, and\n     that you will be saved somehow. But all the time the stone is\n     sinking--sinking--and the day goes by and the night comes and they\n     leave you alone. And perhaps you go to sleep at last. You are\n     horribly tired, because of the weeks of fear that are behind you.\n     Perhaps you dream. You dream you are free and people love you, and\n     you have done nothing wrong and you are frightfully happy, and the\n     one you love most kisses your forehead. But then the kiss grows so\n     cold that you shrink away, only you cannot, and it presses you\n     harder and harder, and you wake up and it is the stone. It is the\n     sinking stone that is pressing you, pressing you, pressing you to\n     death--and you cannot move. And you shriek and shriek for help\n     within your gagged mouth, and no one comes, and always the stone is\n     pressing you, pressing you, pressing you_----\"\n\nClare caught the exercise-book from Alwynne's hand and thrust it into\nthe heart of the half-dead fire. It lay unlighted, charring and\nsmouldering. The unformed handwriting stood out very clearly. Clare\ncaught at a matchbox, and tore it open; the matches showered out over\nher hand on to the rug and grate. She struck one after another, breaking\nthem before they could light. Silently Alwynne took the box from her\nshaking fingers, lit a match and held it to the twisting papers. A thin\nlittle flame flickered up, overran them eagerly, wavered a second, and\ndied with a faint whistling sigh.\n\n\"Do you hear that? Did you see that?\" Clare knelt upright on the hearth.\nShe held up her forefinger. \"Listen! Like a voice! Like a child's voice!\nA child sighing! Light the candles--light all the candles! I want light\neverywhere. No room for any shadow.\"\n\nBut as Alwynne moved obediently, she caught at her hand.\n\n\"Alwynne! Stay with me! Don't go into another room. Alwynne, I'm\nfrightened of my thoughts.\"\n\nAlwynne put her hand shyly on her shoulders, talking at random.\n\n\"Clare, dear, do get up. Come on to the sofa. You mustn't kneel there.\nYou'll strain yourself. I always get tired kneeling in church. It makes\none's heart ache.\"\n\nClare would not move.\n\n\"Don't you think my heart aches?\" she said. \"Don't you think it aches\nall day? You're young--you're cold--you can sit there reading,\nreading--with a ghost at your shoulder----\"\n\nAn undecipherable expression flashed across Alwynne's face. It came but\nto go--and Clare, absorbed in her own passion, saw nothing.\n\n\"It's Louise!\" she cried, between sincerity and histrionics. \"Calling to\nsome one. Calling from her grave. They call it an accident, like fools.\nOh, can't you hear? She died because she was forced. She's\ncomplaining--plaining--plaining----I tell you it's nothing to do with\nme. It wasn't my fault!\"\n\nShe flung her arms about Alwynne's waist and clutched her convulsively.\nShe was sincere enough at last.\n\n\"Alwynne! Alwynne! Say it was not my fault.\"\n\nAlwynne sank to her knees beside her and held her close. They clung to\neach other like scared children. But Clare's abandonment awoke all\nAlwynne's protective instincts. She crushed down whatever emotions had\nhollowed her eyes and whitened her cheeks in the last long weeks, and\naddressed herself to quieting Clare. Clare, stepped off her pedestal,\nunpoised, clinging helplessly, was a new experience. In the face of it\nshe felt herself childish, inadequate. But Clare was in trouble and\nneeded her. The very marvel of it steadied. All her love for Clare rose\nwithin her, overflowed her, like a warm tide.\n\nBy sheer strength she pulled Clare into a chair and dropped on to the\nfloor beside her, face upturned, talking fast and eagerly.\n\n\"You're not to talk like that. Of course it's not your fault. If\nanything could be your fault. Clare, darling, don't look like that. You\nmust lean back and rest. You're just tired, you know. We've talked of it\nso often. You know it was an accident. Why can't you believe it, if\nevery one else does?\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said Clare intently.\n\nAlwynne's eyes met hers defiantly.\n\n\"I do. Of course I do. It's wicked to torment yourself. But if I\ndidn't--if the poor baby was overtired and overworked--is it your fault?\nYou only saw her in class at the last. You couldn't help it if the\nexams, and the play were suddenly too much--if something snapped----\"\n\n\"You see, you do think so,\" said Clare bitterly. \"I've always known you\ndid. Well--think what you like--what do I care?\" She put up her clenched\nhands and rubbed and kneaded at her dry aching eyes.\n\nAlwynne watched her, desperately. Here was her lady wanting comfort, and\nshe had found none. She wracked her brains as the sluggish minutes\npassed.\n\nClare's hands dropped at last. She met Alwynne's anxious gaze and\nlaughed harshly.\n\n\"Well? The verdict? That I was a brute to Louise, I suppose?\"\n\nAlwynne looked at her wistfully.\n\n\"Clare, I do love you so.\"\n\nClare stiffened.\n\n\"Then I warn you--stop! I'm not good for you. I hurt people who love me.\nYou always pestered me about hurting Louise. You needn't protest. You\nalways did. And now you lay her death at my door. I see it in your face.\nCan't I read you like a book? Can't I? Can't I?\" Her face was distorted\nby the conflict within her.\n\nAlwynne's simplicity was convinced. Here, she felt, was tragedy. Awe and\npity tore at her sense of reality. Love loosened her tongue. Her words\nrushed forth in a torrent of incoherent argument. She was so eager that\nher fallacies had power to convince herself, much more Clare.\n\n\"Clare, I won't have it. You don't know what you say. What is this mad\nidea you've got? What would poor Louise think if she heard? Why, she\nadored you. And you were kind--always kind--only when you thought it\nbetter for her, you were strict. It's folly to torment yourself. If you\ndo--what about me?\"\n\n\"You?\" Clare's eyes glinted suddenly.\n\n\"Me! If you are to blame, how much more I? Oh, don't you see?\" Alwynne's\nface grew rapt. Here was inspiration; her path grew suddenly clear.\n\"Clare, don't you see? If she did--\" she paused imperceptibly--\"I ought\nto have seen what was coming. I knew her so much better than you.\"\n\nClare repressed a denial.\n\n\"Oh, darling--you mustn't worry. It's my responsibility. Try and\nthink--at the play, for instance. Did you think her manner strained? No,\nof course you didn't. But I did. I thought at the time it had all been\ntoo much for her. I did notice--I did! I thought--that child will get\nbrain-fever if we're not careful----I meant to speak to Elsbeth. I\nmeant to speak to you. Oh, I'd noticed before. Only I was busy, and\nlazy, and put it off. She was unhappy at failing--I knew. I wanted to\ntell you that I know how much it meant to her--and I didn't. I was\nafraid----\" She broke off abruptly; her eloquence ended as suddenly as\nit had begun.\n\nBut she had succeeded in her desire. Clare was recovering poise; would\nsoon have herself all the more rigidly in control for her recent\ncollapse. She stiffened as she spoke.\n\n\"Afraid of whom?\"\n\n\"I mean I was afraid all along of what might happen,\" Alwynne concluded\nlamely. \"You see, it was my fault?\" There was an odd half-query in her\nvoice.\n\n\"If you noticed so much and never tried to warn me, you are certainly to\nblame.\" Clare's voice was full of reluctant conviction. \"I can't\nremember that you tried very hard.\"\n\n\"Oh, Clare!\" began Alwynne. Their eyes met. Clare's face was hard and\nimpassive--all trace of emotion gone. Her eyes challenged. Alwynne's\nlids dropped as she finished her sentence. \"That is--no, I didn't try\nvery hard.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\nInconceivably an answer suggested itself to Alwynne, an unutterable\niconoclasm. Her mind edged away from it horrified and in an instant it\nwas not. But it had been.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she stammered.\n\n\"You realised the responsibility you incurred?\" Clare went on.\n\n\"I didn't. No, never!\" Alwynne supplicated her.\n\n\"You do now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said despairingly. She rejoiced that Clare could believe\nand be comforted, but it hurt her that she believed so easily. It\nalarmed her, too, made her, knowing her own motives, yet doubt herself.\nShe felt trapped.\n\n\"I'm sorry you told me,\" said Clare abruptly.\n\nThey sat a moment in silence. A ray from the dying sun illuminated their\nfaces. In Alwynne an innocent air of triumph fought with distress, and a\ngrowing uneasiness. Clare was expressionless.\n\nClare put up her hand to shelter herself, and her face was scarcely\nvisible as she went on. She spoke softly.\n\n\"My dear, I can't say I'm not relieved. I feel exonerated--completely.\nYet I wish you hadn't told me. I'd have rather thought it my fault than\nknown it----\"\n\n\"Mine,\" said Alwynne huskily.\n\nClare bent towards her, tender, gracious, yet subtly aloof; confessor,\nnot friend.\n\n\"Oh, Alwynne! Why will you always be so sure of yourself? Why not have\ncome to me for advice as you used to? What are we elder folk for? I love\nyour impetuosity--your self-reliance--and I believe, I shall always\nbelieve, that you wanted to spare me trouble and worry. I know you. But\nyou're not all enough, Alwynne, to decide everything for yourself. You\nwon't believe it, I suppose--oh, I was just the same. But doesn't all\nthis dreadful business show you? A few words--and Louise might have been\nwith us now. Of course you acted for the best, but----There, my dear,\nthere, there----\" for her beautiful, pitiful voice had played too\nexquisitely on Alwynne's nerves, and the girl was sobbing helplessly.\n\nAnd Clare was very kind to Alwynne, and let her cry in peace. And when\nshe was tired of watching her, she braced her with deft praises of\ncourage and self-control. Self-control appealed very strongly to Clare,\nAlwynne knew. While she dried her eyes, Clare whispered to her that the\npast was past and that one couldn't repair one's mistakes by dwelling\non them. Let devotion to the living blot out a debt to the dead. She\nmust try and forget. Clare would help her. Clare would try to forget\ntoo. They would never speak of it again. Never by word or look would\nClare refer to it. It should be blotted out and forgotten.\n\nAnd after a discreet interval, when there was no chance of big,\nirrepressible tears dropping into the gravy, or salting the butter,\nClare thought she would like her supper.\n\nShe made quite a hearty meal, and Alwynne crumbled bread and drank\nthirstily, and watched her with humble, adoring eyes.\n\nClare, in soft undertones, was delicately amusing, full of dainty quips\nthat coaxed Alwynne gently back to smiles and naturalness. She spared no\npains, and sent Alwynne home at last, with, metaphorically speaking, her\nblessing.\n\nBut Alwynne stooped as she walked, as though she carried a burden.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nThe summer holidays came and went, eight cloudless weeks of them. Clare\nloved the sun; was well content to be out, day after day, cushioned and\nreplete, on the sunniest strip of sand in the sunniest corner of a\nparched and gasping England. She found it wonderfully soothing to listen\nwith shut eyes to the purr of the sea and the distant cries of gulls and\nchildren, with Alwynne to fan her and shade her, and clamber up and down\ntwo hundred feet of red cliff for her when the corkscrew was forgotten,\nor the salt, or Clare's bathing-dress, or a half-read magazine. Clare\ngrew brown and plump as the drowsy days went by. Alwynne grew brown,\ntoo, but she certainly did not grow plumper. But then the heat never\nsuited Alwynne. She had often said so, as she reminded Elsbeth. For,\nwhen Alwynne came back to her for the three weeks at home that she had\npersuaded Clare were due to Elsbeth, Elsbeth was difficult to satisfy.\nElsbeth was inclined to be indignant. What sort of a holiday had it\nbeen, if Alwynne could come back so thin, and tired, and colourless\nunder her tan? What had Miss Hartill been about to allow it?\n\nBut Alwynne's account of their pleasant lazy days was certainly\nappeasing.... It must have been the heat.... Not even the most\nsuspicious of aunts could conscientiously suspect Clare of having\nanything to do with it.... Wait till September came, with its cooling\nskies.... Alwynne would be better then.\n\nIn the meantime Elsbeth tried what care and cookery and coddling could\ndo, and Alwynne submitted more patiently than usual.\n\nAlwynne, indeed, was unusually gentle with Elsbeth in the three weeks\nthey spent together before the autumn term began. She was always good to\nElsbeth, considerate of her bodily comforts, lovingly demonstrative. But\nClare had taught Alwynne very carefully that she was growing up at last,\nbecoming financially and morally independent, free to lead her own life,\nthat if she stayed with Elsbeth it was by favour, not by duty. And\nAlwynne, immensely flattered by the picture of herself as a woman of the\nworld, had lived up to it with her usual drastic enthusiasm. Elsbeth,\nnot unused to disillusionment and hopes deferred, could sigh and smile\nand acquiesce, knowing it for the phase that it was and forgiving\nAlwynne in advance. But Clare, who owed her neither gratitude nor duty,\nshe never forgave. She was a very human woman, for all her saintliness.\n\nShe got her reward that summer, when Alwynne came back, quieted, grave,\nvery tender with Elsbeth, clinging to her sometimes as if she were\nnearer nine than nineteen. But Elsbeth was fated never to have her\nhappiness untainted. She was haunted by the conviction that Alwynne's\nsubduement was not natural. Her pleasure in being with her aunt was so\nobvious that Elsbeth was worried, and knowing how infallibly Alwynne\nturned to her in any trouble, she expected revelations. But none\ncame--only the manner was there that always accompanied them. Yet\nsomething was wrong.... A quarrel with Clare Hartill.\n\nBut Alwynne, delicately questioned, chattered happily enough of their\nholiday, and there were frequent letters----She was over-anxious, too,\nto protest that she was perfectly well, and, in proof, exhausted herself\nin unnecessary housework. But she continued restless and abstracted,\njumped absurdly at any sudden noise, and followed Elsbeth about like a\nhomeless dog.\n\nAnd she had contracted an odd habit of coming late at night into\nElsbeth's room, trailing blankets and a pillow under her arm, to beg to\nsleep on Elsbeth's sofa--just this once! She would laugh at herself and\npull Elsbeth's face down to her for a kiss, but she never gave any good\nreason for her whim. But she came so often that Elsbeth had a bed made\nup for her at last, and she slept there all the holidays, or lay awake.\nElsbeth suspected that she lay awake two nights out of three.\n\nWith the autumn term Alwynne seemed to rouse herself, and flung herself\ninto her work with her usual energy. Elsbeth saw less of her. The school\nclaimed all her days, and Clare the bulk of her evenings. She had moved\nback into her own room again, and Elsbeth, her door ajar, would lie and\nwatch the crack of light across the passage, and grieve over her\ndarling's sleeplessness, and the shocking waste of electric light.\n\nShe wondered if the girl were working too hard.... Could that be at the\nroot of the matter? She grew so anxious that she could even consult\nClare on one of the latter's rare and formal calls.\n\n\"I am so glad to see you. Alwynne is changing; she'll be down in a\nminute. I made her lie down. Miss Hartill, I'm very distressed about the\nchild. Do you think she looks well?\"\n\nClare, less staccato than usual, certainly didn't think so.\n\n\"So thin--she's growing so dreadfully thin! Her neck! You should see her\nneck--salt-cellars, literally! And she had such a beautiful neck! But\nyou've never seen her in evening dress.\"\n\nYes, Clare had seen her.\n\n\"And so white and listless! I don't know what to make of her. I don't\nknow what to do.\"\n\nClare, with unusual gentleness, would not advise Elsbeth to worry\nherself. Possibly Alwynne was doing a little too much. Clare would make\nenquiries. But she was sure that Elsbeth was over-anxious.\n\nBut Elsbeth was not to be comforted. She nodded to the open door.\n\n\"Look at her now--dragging across the hall.\"\n\nBut Alwynne, in her gay frock, cheeks, at sight of Clare, suddenly\naflame, did not look as if there were much amiss. She was thinner, of\ncourse....\n\nElsbeth, however, had made Clare uneasy. She attacked Alwynne on the\nfollowing day.\n\n\"Your aunt says you're dying, Alwynne. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Dear old Elsbeth!\" Alwynne laughed lightly.\n\n\"_Is_ anything wrong?\" Clare did not appear to look at her; nevertheless\nshe did not miss the slight change in Alwynne's face, as she answered\nwith careful cheeriness--\n\n\"What should be wrong in this best of all possible----\"\n\nClare caught her up.\n\n\"I'm not a fool, Alwynne. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't discuss me with Elsbeth,\" said Alwynne uneasily. \"I\ndon't like it. I won't have you bothered.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" said Clare coolly. \"At the same time----\"\n\nAlwynne braced herself. She knew the tone.\n\n\"--I don't like any one about me with a secret grief and a pale,\ncourageous smile. I can't stand a martyr.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" Alwynne was wincing. Then, suddenly: \"What has Elsbeth been\nsaying? Honestly, I didn't know she'd noticed anything.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Clare again, gently enough. \"Tell me, silly\nchild!\"\n\nAlwynne shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Nothing! Just life!\"\n\nClare waited.\n\n\"I'm sorry if I've been horrid--\" she paused--\"to Elsbeth.\"\n\nClare opened her eyes.\n\n\"What about me?\"\n\n\"I'm never horrid to you,\" said Alwynne with compunction. \"That's what's\nso beastly of me.\"\n\n\"Well, upon my word!\" cried Clare blankly.\n\n\"Oh, you know what I mean.\" Alwynne jumbled her words. \"I always want to\nbe nice to you. It's perfectly easy. And then I go home to Elsbeth, the\ndarling, and am grumpy and snappy, and show her all the hateful side of\nme. Heaven knows why! Only yesterday she said, 'You wouldn't speak to\nClare Hartill like that,' in her dear, hurt voice. I felt such a brute.\"\n\nA little smile hovered at the corners of Clare's mouth.\n\n\"I was always so sorry,\" said Clare smoothly, \"that you couldn't spend\nChristmas Day with me last year.\"\n\nAlwynne wrinkled her forehead.\n\n\"What's that got to do----?\"\n\nClare caught her up.\n\n\"With your secret griefs? Nothing whatever! You're quite right. But what\nare they, Alwynne? Who's been worrying you? Have you got too much to\ndo?\"\n\n\"It's not that,\" said Alwynne unwillingly.\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"Oh, things!\"\n\n\"What things?\"\n\n\"Miss Vigers, for one,\" Alwynne began. Then she burst out: \"Clare, I\ndon't know what I've done to her. She never leaves me alone.\"\n\nClare stiffened.\n\n\"Miss Vigers? What has she to say to you? You're responsible to\nme--after Miss Marsham.\"\n\n\"She doesn't seem to think so. It's nag, nag, nag--fuss, fuss, fuss. Are\nthe girls working properly? Am I not neglecting this? Or overdoing that?\nDo I remember that Dolly Brown had measles three terms ago? Why is\nWinifred Hawkins allowed to sit with the light in her eyes? Do I make a\nhabit of keeping So-and-so in? and if so, why so? And Miss Marsham\ndoesn't approve of this, and Miss Marsham evidently doesn't know of\nthat--and my manner is excessively independent--and will I kindly\nremember...? Oh, Clare, it's simply awful. I get no peace. And you know\nhow driven I am, with Miss Hutchins away. You'd think I'd done something\nawful from the way she treats me. Everlastingly spying and hinting----\"\n\n\"Hinting what?\" Clare's voice was icy.\n\n\"That's what I can't make out. That's the maddening part of it. Do you\nthink I'm such a failure? Do you think I'm not to be trusted? I get on\nwith the children--they work well! Truly, Clare, I don't know why she\ndislikes me so. You'd think she was trying to worry me into leaving.\"\n\n\"You should have told me before,\" said Clare curtly, and changed the\nsubject so abruptly that Alwynne feared she was angry, and wished that\nshe had held her tongue.\n\nShe was right. Clare was angry. Clare had conveniently forgotten her\nlittle conversation with Henrietta on that panic-stricken summer day:\nwas naturally surprised and indignant to find it bearing the fruit she\nhad intended it to bear. This was what came of confiding in people! And\nHenrietta, she had no doubt, would be prepared to give chapter and verse\nfor her surveillance, if Clare should, directly or indirectly, call it\nin question.... Henrietta would appear to have Clare in a cleft stick:\nand Alwynne was to suffer in consequence. Clare (a great deal fonder\nof Alwynne than she, or Alwynne, or any one save Elsbeth, guessed)\nlaughed to herself, once, softly, and her eyes snapped. Wait a while,\nHenrietta ... wait a wee while!\n\nThoughtfully she approached the question of the counter-attack. That was\ninevitable, a sop to her own conscience. Besides, it would be\namusing.... It was necessary, however, to decide upon the weapon.\n\nIt was a small matter--the refusal of a boarder for lack of space--that\nprovided it. Quietly, she went to work.\n\nFor the first time, for her own departments had allowed her energy its\noutlet, she set herself to disentangle the lines on which the school was\nrun. She found many knots. Half day, half boarding school, grown from a\ntimid beginning into one of the most flourishing of its kind, it was,\nindeed, like the five hundred-year-old town in which it stood, a\nmarvellous compound of ancient custom and modern usage. The \"Seminary\nfor Young Ladies\" of the 'seventies was three parts obliterated by the\n'nineties High School regimen, on which, in its turn, was superimposed\nthe cricket and hockey of the twentieth century's effemination of the\npublic-school system; the whole swollen, patchwork concern held together\nby the personality of its creator, and its own reputation.\n\nClare nodded. It was obvious to her, that with the retirement of Miss\nMarsham, accomplished already in all save name, the school would fall to\npieces. A pity ... it had a fine past ... was a valuable property\nstill.... With a vigorous woman at its head, judiciously iconoclastic,\nno stickler for tradition, it would revive its youth.... She herself,\nfor instance.... She toyed with the idea.\n\nMiss Marsham was looking out for a successor.... She herself had been\nsounded.... Should she? She shook her head. Life was very pleasant as it\nwas.... She knew that she hated responsibility as much as she liked\npower.... She sat on the school's shoulders, at present.... As head\nmistress the school would sit on hers.... No, thank you! She had better\nuses for her spare time.... There were books ... idleness ...\nAlwynne.... Imagine never having time to play with Alwynne!\n\nNevertheless it would be fascinating to plan out the reorganisation of\nthe school ... and carry it out, for that matter. She could do it, she\nknew. She would get all pat and then have some talks--some suggestive\ntalks--with Miss Marsham.... She, Clare, had some little influence....\nAnd there was life in the old warhorse yet.... Anything that she could\nbe persuaded to believe would benefit her school would have her instant\nsanction.... She would be nominally responsible, of course, and would\ngive Clare, nevertheless, a free hand.... And Clare, sweeping clean,\nwould sweep away whatever withstood her.... Henrietta would have little\nenergy left for Alwynne when Clare had finished her spring-cleaning....\n\nFor the next few weeks, Clare spent nearly all her spare time at the\nschool. She would stay to supper, and even, on occasion, superintend\n\"lights out.\" She would ask artless questions, and the matron and the\nyoung mistresses found her \"so sympathetic when you really got her to\nyourself. So sensible, you know--always sees what you mean.\"\n\nFinally, Clare shut herself up for a Saturday and a Sunday with a neat\nlittle note-book, and drew up plans and made some calculations. Then she\nwent to see Miss Marsham. She went to see Miss Marsham several times.\n\nThe plan was certainly an excellent one.... Miss Marsham could not\nfollow the details very well ... but that, of course, would be dear\nClare's affair.... A great saving ... an immense improvement.... There\nwould be changes, of course.... This idea of separate houses, for\ninstance.... It would mean taking extra premises--but Clare was quite\nright, they were overcrowded--had had to turn away girls.... She quite\nagreed with Clare ... she had always preferred boarders herself; one had\na freer hand.... With a mistress responsible for each house, though,\nwhat would there be left for Miss Vigers to do?... Yes--she might take\nover a house, of course.... But Miss Marsham paused uneasily. She\nanticipated trouble with Henrietta.\n\nShe was justified. Henrietta refused utterly to discuss the suggested\nalterations. Miss Marsham must excuse her; she had her position.... One\nhouse? after controlling the entire school's economy? She did not\nsuggest that Miss Marsham could be serious--that was impossible.... Miss\nMarsham was serious? Then there was no more to be said....\n\nShe said a good deal, however, and at considerable length; ended,\nbreathless, waspish, leaving her resignation in her principal's hands.\nNeither she nor Miss Marsham dreamed that it would be accepted.\n\nBut Clare Hartill, consulted by Miss Marsham, was puzzlingly relieved.\nVery delicately she congratulated her chief on being extricated from a\ndifficult position; praised Miss Vigers's tact--or her sense of fitness.\nUnusual good sense.... People so seldom realised their limitations,\nunprompted ... poor Miss Vigers was certainly no longer young ... hardly\nthe woman for a modern house-mistress-ship.... Old fashioned ... in\nthese days of degrees and college-training so much more was expected ...\nand after that affair in the summer no doubt she had lost confidence in\nherself.... Clare was sure that Miss Vigers had appreciated Miss\nMarsham's forbearance, but of course, she must know, in her own heart,\nthat if she had taken proper precautions--it was her business to arrange\nfor a mistress to be on duty, wasn't it?--the accident could not have\nhappened. Poor little Louise! Oh, and of course, poor Miss Vigers\ntoo!... Well, it was for the best, she supposed ... and Miss Vigers\nseemed to feel that it was time for her to go.... Perhaps it was.... But\nthey would all be sorry to lose her.... Clare really thought that she\nwould like to get up a presentation from the school.... Now what did\nMiss Marsham consider appropriate?\n\nSo Henrietta found herself taken at her word. She left, passionately\nresentful, at the half-term; hoping, at least, to embarrass her employer\nthereby. (But Clare Hartill knew of such a nice suitable\nwoman--Newnham.)\n\nHenrietta Vigers was forty-seven when she left. She had spent youth and\nprime at the school, and had nothing more to sell. She had neither\ncertificates nor recommendations behind her. She was hampered by her\naggressive gentility. Out of a \u00c2\u00a350 salary she had scraped together \u00c2\u00a3500.\nInvested daringly it yielded her \u00c2\u00a325 a year. She had no friends outside\nthe school. She left none within it.\n\nMiss Marsham presented her with a gold watch, decorously inscribed; the\nschool with a handsomely bound edition of Shakespeare.\n\nHeaven knows what became of her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nSaid Clare to Elsbeth at their next meeting--\n\n\"I found out what the trouble was. Henrietta Vigers has been\nslave-driving her. I should have guessed before, but you know that sort\nof thing can go on in a school unnoticed.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Elsbeth.\n\nClare shot a suspicious glance at her, but Elsbeth's face was impassive.\n\n\"But she'll be all right now. Miss Vigers is leaving us at half-term.\"\n\n\"So I hear.\"\n\nTheir eyes met. Clare flushed faintly.\n\n\"I couldn't have Alwynne bullied.\"\n\n\"I know exactly how you feel,\" said Elsbeth quietly. Then, with a direct\nglance, \"Has Miss Vigers got another post?\"\n\n\"I haven't enquired.\"\n\n\"You're a bad enemy,\" Elsbeth's tone was quaintly reflective, almost\nadmiring.\n\n\"But a good friend, I hope?\" Clare laughed.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Elsbeth doubtfully, and Clare laughed again. It amused\nher to cross swords with Elsbeth. At times she felt, that had it not\nbeen for Alwynne--that bone of contention she could have liked her.\n\n\"You can't be one without the other,\" she instructed her. \"I don't\npretend to be a saint. And you'll see how much better Alwynne will be\nnext term.\"\n\nBut the spring term came, and Alwynne was no better. She flagged like a\ntransplanted tree. She went about her business as usual, but even\nClare, not too willing to acknowledge what interfered with her scheme of\nthings, realised that her efficiency was laborious, that her high\nspirits were forced, her comicalities not spontaneous, that she was in\nfact, not herself, but merely an elaborate imitation.\n\nBut where Elsbeth grew anxious Clare grew irritated. She spied a\nmystery. Some obscure, yet powerful instinct prevented her from probing\nit, but she was none the less piqued at being left in the dark. It\nannoyed her too, that Alwynne should be obviously and daily losing her\nhealth and good looks. Clare required above all vitality in her\nassociates. It had been, in her eyes, one of Alwynne's most attractive\ncharacteristics. This changing Alwynne, whitened, quieted, submissive,\nthe sparkle gone from her eyes and the snap from her tongue, was less to\nher taste. Alwynne, very conscious of her shortcomings and of Clare's\nirritation at them, grew daily more nervously propitiatory--ever a fatal\nattitude to Clare. It roused the petty tyrant in her. There were\njarrings, misunderstandings, exhausting scenes and more exhausting\nreconciliations. Yet the two were always together. Clare, viciously\nadroit as she grew in those days in piercing the armour of Alwynne's\npeace, exacted nevertheless her incessant service. And never had Alwynne\nso strained every nerve to please her.\n\nElsbeth, guessing at the situation, could give thanks when influenza,\nsweeping over the school, claimed Alwynne as its earliest victim. Her\nturn had come. She nursed Alwynne through the attack, prolonged her\nconvalescence, excluded all enquirers, censored messages and letters.\nWhen Alwynne grew better, and talked, restless yet unwilling, of fixing\nthe date of her return, Elsbeth, lips firmly set, went out one afternoon\nto pay a call upon Miss Marsham, and returning, sat down to write a\nletter. She busied herself for the rest of that day and all the next\nover Alwynne's wardrobe, mending and pressing and freshening.\n\nAlwynne protested.\n\n\"Elsbeth dear, do leave my things alone. I'll mend them some\ntime--honestly. They're all right. I wish you wouldn't fuss.\"\n\nBut Elsbeth fussed placidly on.\n\nIn the evening came letters for them both. Alwynne read hers hurriedly.\n\n\"Elsbeth, it's from Clare! She wants to know why I'm not coming back.\nWhat does she mean? Of course I'm coming back. Mademoiselle Charette is\nalready, and she was ill after I was!\"\n\nElsbeth sniffed.\n\n\"She was only in bed two days--Miss Marsham said so. You're not going\nback this term, Alwynne. I've seen Miss Marsham myself. I told her what\nthe doctor said. I've arranged things. She agrees with me--you're not\nfit to. It's only a month to end of term. They can manage. You've simply\ngot to have a change. So I wrote to Dene--to the Lumsdens, and Alicia's\nanswer has just come. They're delighted to have you. I knew they would\nbe, of course. They have asked us so often. Such a lovely place. Now, my\ndear, be a sensible child and don't argue, because I've made up my mind.\nIt'll do you good to get away.\"\n\nFor in Alwynne's face astonishment had been succeeded by indignation.\nElsbeth prepared herself resignedly to face a storm of protest,\nif not a blank refusal. To be arranged for as if she were a\nchild--unconsulted--Clare--the school--the coaching--leaving Elsbeth\nalone--Dene--utter strangers--perfectly well--simply ridiculous. Elsbeth\nsaw it all coming.\n\n\"My dear Elsbeth! What a preposterous----\" began Alwynne. Then the\nweakness of convalescence swamped her. She sank back in her chair.\n\n\"Perhaps it will,\" said Alwynne wearily. \"All right, Elsbeth! I'll go if\nyou want me to. Anyway, I don't much care.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nA week later Alwynne was sitting in a diminutive go-cart drawn by a\nlarge pony, and driven by a large lady with a wide smile and bulgy\nknees, with which, as the little cart jolted over the stony road, she\nunconsciously nudged Alwynne, imparting an air of sly familiarity to her\npleasant, formal talk. This, Alwynne supposed, was Alicia. She liked\nher, liked her fat kind face, her comfortable rotundity, and her sweet\nvoice. She liked her cool disregard of her own comical appearance,\nwedged in among portmanteaux and Alwynne and a basket of market produce,\nwith an old sun-hat tied bonnet-fashion to shade her eyes, and her scarf\nends fluttering madly, as she thwacked and tugged at the iron-mouthed\npony.\n\nShe was more than middle-aged, a woman of flopping draperies and\nhaphazard hookings, and scatter-brained grey locks, that had been a\nfringe in the days of fringes. She moved, as Alwynne noticed later, like\na hurried cow, and tripped continually over her long skirts. Yet, in\nspite of her ramshackle exterior, she was not ridiculous. The good-men\nand stray children they encountered greeted her with obvious respect.\nAlwynne, comparing the keen eyes and their cheerful crowsfeet, with the\nchin, firm enough in its cushion of fat, guessed her the ruling spirit\nof the Dene household, and wondered why she had not married a vicar.\n\nBut Alicia, though Alwynne listened politely to her flow of talk, and\nanswered prettily when she must, did not long occupy her attention.\n\nShe was in her own country again. She loved the country--woods, fields,\nhedges and lanes--as she loved no city or sea-town of them all. London,\nParis, Rome--Swiss mountains or Italian lakes--she would have given\nthem all for Kent and Hampshire and the Sussex Weald. But Clare would\nnever hear of a country holiday. Alwynne took deep breaths of the clean,\nkindly air, and wondered to herself that she had taken the proposal of\nher holiday so dully. She had not realised that she was going into the\ncountry--she had not realised anything, except that she was tired, and\nthat Elsbeth would not leave her alone. She had shrunk painfully from\nthe idea of meeting strangers, from the exertion of accommodating\nherself to them. But this good air made one feel alive again....\n\nShe stared over the pony's ears at the gay spring landscape.\n\n\"Those are the Dene fields,\" said Alicia, following her glance. \"There\nare two Denes, you know--Dene Village and Dene Fields. There's a couple\nof miles between them. We are in the hollow, where the road dips, at the\nfoot of Witch Hill.\"\n\n\"Witch Hill?\"\n\nAlicia flourished her whip at the sky-line. The fields were spread over\nthe hillside in sections of chocolate and magenta and silver-green, with\nhere and again a parti-coloured patch, where oats and dandelions,\npimpernel and sky-blue flax choked and strangled on an ash-heap. From\nthe slopes Witch Hill lifted a brow of blank white chalk, crowned and\ndraped in woodland, lying against pillows of cloud, for all the world\nlike a hag abed, knees hunched, and patchwork quilt drawn up to ragged\neyebrows. Round her neck the road wound like a silver riband; looped,\ndipped, disappeared, for two unfenced miles--to flash into view but a\nparrot's flight away, and swerve, with a steep little rush, round a\nhouse with French windows thatched in yellow jessamine.\n\nAlwynne's eyes lit up.\n\n\"What a good name! Who was she before she was turned into that?\" She\nstopped, flushing. Alicia would think her stupid.\n\nAlicia laughed pleasantly.\n\n\"Do you like fairy tales? You've come to the right place--the\ncountry-side's full of them. There's a fairy fort--Roman I suppose,\nreally, and a haunted barn out beyond Dene Compton, besides Witch Hill\nand the Witch Wood just behind our house. There's a story, of course. I\ndon't know it--you must ask Roger. He's always picking up stories.\"\n\n\"Roger?\"\n\n\"My nephew, Roger Lumsden. Hasn't Elsbeth----?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course.\"\n\n\"He's away just now. Look, now you can see the house properly.\"\n\n\"Behind the hill?\" Alwynne had caught sight of a group of buildings\ncrowning a secondary slope.\n\n\"No, no--that's the school, Dene Compton.\"\n\n\"A school?\" Alwynne screwed up her eyes to look at it. \"What a big\nplace! Girls or boys?\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\n\"Oh! A board school!\" Alwynne's interest flagged.\n\n\"Scarcely!\" Alicia laughed. \"Haven't you heard of Dene Compton? And you\na school-mistress!\"\n\nAlwynne was politely blank.\n\n\"The thin end of the co-educational wedge. It's unique--or was, till a\nfew years ago. There are several now, dotted about England. You ladies'\nseminaries should be trembling in your shoes.\"\n\n\"Boys and girls! What a mad idea! Yes, I believe Clare--I believe I did\nhear something about it. It's all cranks and simple lifers and\nsocialists though, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You'd better come up one day and see. I'll take you.\"\n\n\"Why, do you know them?\"\n\n\"I teach there.\"\n\n\"You? Oh--I beg your pardon,\" cried Alwynne strickenly.\n\nAlicia laughed.\n\n\"I'm accustomed to it. Jean will be delighted with an ally. She\npretends to disapprove. But Roger and I are generally too much for her.\"\n\n\"Is he a master, then?\"\n\n\"Good gracious, no! But he has a lot of friends at the school. He ought\nto be interested--it's his land, you know. His people lived there for\ngenerations--the Lumsdens of Dene Compton. The head master has the old\nhouse, but the school itself is new--all those buildings you see. No,\nnot those--\" Alwynne's eyes were caught by a glitter of glass\nroofs--\"those are Roger's houses. He's a gardener, you know. He lives\nfor his bulbs and his manures.\"\n\nThe tiny cart rocked as the pony bucketed down the dip of the road and\nwhirled it through the gates and up the short drive. Alwynne clutched\nthe inadequate rail.\n\n\"He will do it,\" said Alicia resignedly. \"He wants his tea. There's\nJean. Mind the door.\"\n\nShe pulled up the rocketing pony as the ridiculous little door burst\nopen and Alwynne and her baggage were precipitated on to the gravel.\n\nA little woman ran out from the porch.\n\n\"Are you hurt? It always does that. I'm always asking Alicia to tell\nBryce to take it to be seen to. Alicia--I shall speak to Roger if you\ndon't. My dear, I hope you haven't hurt yourself. That pretty frock--but\nit will all brush off. And how is Elsbeth, and why didn't you bring her\nwith you? Come in at once and have some tea. Alicia has driven round to\nthe stables. It's Bryce's afternoon off.\"\n\nJean was a prim little red-haired woman, some years younger than Alicia,\nwith brisk ways, and a clacking tongue. She had Alwynne in a chair, had\ngiven her tea, deplored her white looks, suggested three infallible\nremedies, recounted their effect on her own constitution and Alicia's\nand her nephew's, and, digressing easily, was beginning a detailed\nhistory of Roger's health since, at the age of five or thereabouts, he\nhad come under her care, before Alwynne had had time to realise more\nthan that the room was very cheerful, Jean very talkative, and she\nherself very, very tired. She could not help being relieved when Alicia\nreturned. Jean, with her neat dress and knowledgeable ways and little\nair of apologising for her slap-dash elder, should, by all the rules,\nhave been the more reliable of the cousins. Yet Alwynne turned\ninstinctively to Alicia; and Alicia, spread upon a chair, fanning\nherself cyclonically with her enormous hat, did not fail her.\n\n\"Jean! The child's as white as a sheet. You can ask about Elsbeth\nto-morrow, and Roger will keep. Take her up to her room, leave her to\nunpack and lie down in peace and quiet, and come back and give me my\ntea. Supper's at seven, Alwynne. Take my advice and have a good rest.\nThere are plenty of books--oh, yes, I know all about your likes and\ndislikes. Elsbeth's a talker too--on paper! Jean--if you're not down in\nfive minutes, I'll come and fetch you.\"\n\nAlwynne, half an hour later, curled comfortably upon a sofa, in front of\na blazing fire, with a lazy hour before her and a Copperfield upon her\nknee, thought that Alicia was a perfect dear. And Jean? Jean, pulling\nout the sofa, poking the fire, pattering about her like a too\nintelligent terrier--Jean was a dear too.... They were a couple of\ncomical dears.\n\nAnd \"The Dears\" was Alwynne's name for them from that day on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nAlwynne settled down with an ease that surprised herself. Much as she\nloved the country, a country life would have bored her to death, Clare\nhad often assured her, as a permanent state; but for a few weeks it was\ncertainly delightful. She enjoyed pottering about the garden with Jean,\nand jogging into the village on her own account behind the obstinate\npony, who, approving her taste in apples, allowed her to believe that\nshe more or less regulated his direction and pace. She enjoyed the\ncomplicated smells of the village store, half post office, half\nemporium, and the taste of its gargantuan bulls'-eyes. She sent, in the\nfirst enthusiasm of discovery, a tinful heaped about with early\nprimroses to Clare; but Clare was not impressed.\n\nClare disapproved strongly of Alwynne's holiday, needed her too much to\nallow it necessary. Her first letters were a curious mixture--half\nfretfulness over Alwynne's absence, half assurance of how perfectly well\nshe, Clare, got on without her. Alwynne would have been exquisitely\namazed could she have known how eagerly Clare awaited her bi-weekly\nbudget. Alwynne was afraid her letters were dull enough. She apologised\nconstantly--\n\n     _Of course, Clare, this will seem very small beer to you--but\n     little things are important down here. It's all so quiet, you see.\n     I've been perfectly happy this morning because I found a patch of\n     white violets in a clearing, and Jean and Alicia were just as\n     excited when I told them at lunch: and we went off with a\n     tea-basket afterwards, and dug violet roots for an hour, or more,\n     and then spread our mackintoshes over a felled trunk and made tea.\n     The ground was sopping, but it was fun. You'd love my cousins.\n     They're as old as Elsbeth but full of beans, and they've travelled\n     and are interesting--only they will talk incessantly about this\n     nephew they've got. It's \"Roger\" this and \"Roger\" that--he seems to\n     rule them with a rod of iron--can't do wrong! He comes back next\n     week. I rather wonder what he'll be like. The Dears make him out a\n     paragon; but I'm expecting a prig, myself! There are photographs of\n     him all over the place. He's quite good-looking._\n\nBut before Alwynne could tire of the lanes and village, of gardening\nwith Jean, and hints of how Roger stubbed up roots and handled bulbs,\nAlicia had provided her with a new interest. She remembered her promise\none morning and took her up to Dene Compton.\n\nAlicia gave Italian lessons twice a week, and from her Alwynne had\ngleaned many quaint details of the school and its workings. What she\nheard interested her, though she was prepared to be merely, if\nindulgently, amused. She looked forward to the visit if only to get copy\nfor a letter to Clare. Clare, too, liked to be amused.\n\nThe gong was clanging for the mid-morning break when Alicia, Alwynne in\nher wake, led the way into the main building, and waving her airily\ntowards a mound of biscuits, bade her help herself and look about her\nfor a while, because she, Alicia, had got to speak to--She dived into\nthe crowd.\n\nAlwynne, thus deserted, stood shyly enough in a roofed corner of the\ngreat brick quadrangle, munching a fair imitation of a dog-biscuit, and\nwatching the boys and girls who swarmed past her as undisturbed by her\npresence as if she were invisible. At the boys she smiled indulgently as\nshe would have smiled at a string of lively terriers, but of the girls\nshe was sharply critical. They wore curious, and as she thought hideous,\nserge tunics: she jibbed at their utilitarian plaits: but she conceded a\ngood carriage to most of them and was impressed by a certain pleasant\nfearlessness of manner. A couple of men, Alicia, and a bright, emphatic\nwoman in a nurse's uniform, wandered through the crowd, which made way\ncourteously enough, but seemed otherwise in no degree embarrassed by\ntheir propinquity. Alwynne had a sudden memory of Clare's triumphal\nprocessions; compared them uneasily with the fashion of these quiet\npeople.\n\nShe watched a small girl dash panting to the loggia at the opposite side\nof the quadrangle, where a slight man in disreputable tennis-shoes,\nleaned against a shaft and observed the pleasant tumult. There was a\nmoment's earnest consultation, and the small girl darted away again and\ndisappeared down a corridor. The man resumed his former pose--head on\none side, smiling a little.\n\nAlwynne ventured out of her corner and caught at Alicia as she passed.\n\n\"Cousin Alice! I like all this. I'm glad you brought me. Who's that?\"\nShe nodded towards the man in tennis-shoes.\n\n\"The Head.\"\n\n\"The head-master?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"But--but--when Miss Marsham comes in--you can hear a pin drop----Is he\nnice?\"\n\nAlicia laughed.\n\n\"I'll introduce you.\"\n\nShe did.\n\n\"Well,\" said Alicia with a twinkle as they walked home together later,\n\"what did you think of him?\"\n\nAlwynne flushed, but she laughed too.\n\n\"Cousin Alice--it was too bad of you. He just said 'How do you do?' and\nsmiled politely. Then he said nothing at all for five minutes, and then\nhe clutched at one of the girls and handed me over to her with another\nsmile--an immensely relieved one--and drifted away. I've never been so\nsnubbed in my life.\"\n\n\"You're not the first one. So you didn't like him?\"\n\n\"Oh--I liked him,\" conceded Alwynne grudgingly.\n\nThey walked on in silence for a while.\n\n\"What's that?\" Alwynne pointed to a large grey building half way down\nthe avenue.\n\n\"The girls' house, Hill Dene. They sleep there; and have the needlework\nclasses, and housewifery, I believe.\"\n\n\"Do they have everything else with the boys?\"\n\n\"Practically.\"\n\n\"Does it answer?\"\n\n\"Why not? Girls with brothers and boys with sisters have an advantage\nover the solitary specimens, everybody knows. This is only extending the\nprinciple.\"\n\nAlwynne giggled suddenly.\n\n\"You know that girl he dumped me on to--she was showing me round, and we\nran into some boys in the gym. I couldn't make out why, but she jolly\nwell sent them flying.\"\n\n\"Out of hours, I expect.\"\n\n\"But the coolness of it, Cousin Alice! She was a bit of a thing--the\nboys were half as high again!\"\n\n\"But not prefects.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\" Alwynne meditated. \"Oh, Cousin Alicia, that girl asked\nme to go with them next Saturday for a tramp. Over Witch Hill.\nShe and another girl and some boys. Imagine! they're going by\nthemselves--without a master or a mistress or anything!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"We don't. We crocodile. Two and two, and two and two, and two and two.\nAnd I trot along at the side and see that they don't take arms. But of\ncourse, you can't control the day-girls. One of them asked two of the\nboarders out for the day one Sunday, at least her mother did, and we met\nthem after church on the promenade, arm in arm--all three! I tell you,\nthere was a row. They were locked up in their bedrooms for three days,\nand nobody might speak to them for the rest of the term. Miss Marsham\nsaid it was defiance and that they might remember they were ladies.\"\n\n\"I don't think they want 'ladies' here,\" said Alicia. \"They're quite\ncontent if they produce gentlewomen. Your school must be peculiar.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Alwynne, opening her eyes. \"There are dozens of schools\nlike Utterbridge. I was at two myself when I was young. It's this place\nthat's peculiar. It's like nothing I've heard of. I want to explore. He\nsaid I could. Yes, I forgot--he did say that--that I was to come up\nwhenever I liked.\"\n\nAnd for the next week Alwynne spent a good half of her days at Dene\nCompton. She clung to Alicia's skirts at the first, afraid of appearing\nto intrude. But she soon found that she might go where she would without\narousing curiosity or even notice, though boys and girls alike were\nfriendly enough when she spoke to them. Accustomed to her mistress-ship,\nshe was half-piqued, half-amused to find herself so entirely\nunimportant.\n\nBut the great school fascinated her. It was scarce a third larger than\nher own in point of numbers, but the perfection of its proportions made\nit impressive. The arrangements for the children's physical well-being\nreflected the methods employed for their spiritual development. There\nwas an insistence on sunlight and fresh air and space--above all, space.\nThere was no calculation of the legal minimum of cubic feet: body and\nmind alike were given room in which to turn, to stretch themselves, to\ngrow.\n\nGradually she realised that she had been living for years in a rabbit\nwarren.\n\nWith her discoveries she filled many sheets of notepaper. But Clare's\nletters were nicely calculated to divert enthusiasm. Their tone was\nchanging; they allowed Alwynne to guess herself missed. There was in\nthem a hint of appeal: a suggestion of lonely evenings----Never a word\nof Alwynne's doings. Yet, by implication, description of her new friends\nand their outlook was dismissed as unnecessary. Clare, Alwynne was to\nrealise, would smile pleasantly as she read, and think it all rather\nsilly.\n\nElsbeth--_so pleased that they are so kind to you at Alicia's\nschool_--was more genuinely uninterested. Dene Compton had been the home\nof a certain John Lumsden for Elsbeth. She did not care for descriptions\nof its metamorphosis. She wanted to hear about Dene, and her cousins,\nand how Alwynne was eating and sleeping, and if Roger Lumsden had come\nback yet. She asked twice if Roger Lumsden had come back yet. But\nAlwynne had an annoying habit of leaving her questions unanswered\nthrough eight closely written sheets. It was not only Clare who was very\ntired of co-education and Dene Compton.\n\nBut Elsbeth got her news at last, and was satisfied with it as\nMacchiavellis usually are, whose plots are being developed by\nunconscious and self-willed instruments. Alwynne, who in her spare time\nhad discovered what spring in the country could mean, tucked in the news\nat the end of an epistle that was purely botanical----\n\n     _... and cuckoo-pint and primroses and violets! Have you ever seen\n     larches in bud? Oh, Elsbeth, why can't we live in the country?\n     Every collection of buildings bigger than Dene Village ought to be\n     razed by Act of Parliament. I expect the earth hates cities as I\n     hated warts on my hands when I was little. Well, I must stop.\n     Oh--the Lumsden man turned up a day or two ago. The Dears were in\n     ecstasies, and he let himself be fussed over in the calmest way, as\n     if he had a perfect right to it. I think he's conceited. I don't\n     think you'd like him. He's back for good, apparently, but he won't\n     worry me much. I'm only in at meals. The Dears are always busy and\n     let me do as I like, and I either go up to Compton, or prowl, or\n     take a rug and book into the garden. It's quite hot, although it's\n     barely April--so you needn't worry. The garden is jolly, big and\n     half wild: only \"Roger\" is beginning to trim it--the vandal! He's\n     by way of being a gardener, you know. Great on bulbs and roses, I\n     believe._\n\n     _By the way_ is _he a relation? Even The Dears are only very\n     distant cousins, aren't they? Because he will call me \"Alwynne\" as\n     if he were. I call it cheek. I was very stiff, but he's got a hide\n     like a rhinoceros. When I said \"Mr. Lumsden,\" he just grinned. So\n     now I say \"Roger\" very markedly whenever he says \"Alwynne.\" I can't\n     see what Jean and Alicia see in him; but of course I have to be\n     polite. They are dears, if you like--are giving me a lovely time._\n\n     _I hope you're not very dull, Elsbeth dear. You must try and get\n     out this lovely weather. Why not have Clare to tea one day? You'd\n     both enjoy it. I heard from her yesterday--such a jolly letter!_\n\n     _Heaps of love from Jean and Alicia--and you know what a lot from\n     me._\n\n                                                           ALWYNNE.\n\n     _P.S.--I found these violets to-day on a bank behind the church.\n     They'll be squashed when you get 'em, but they'll smell still._\n\n     _P.S.--The Lumsden man saw me writing, and said, would I send you\n     his love, and do you remember him? I told him I'd scarcely heard\n     you mention his name, so it wasn't probable--but he just smiled his\n     superior smile. He reminds me of Mr. Darcy in P. and P. I can't say\n     I like him._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nRoger Lumsden had been home a week. Alwynne, save at meals, had seen\nlittle of him, and that little she did not intend to like. There was a\nmemory of a passage of arms at their first meeting which rankled.\n\nRoger had been inquiring when the Compton holidays began. Alicia\nhesitated--\n\n\"Let me see--the play's Tuesday week----\"\n\n\"Wednesday week,\" put in Alwynne.\n\n\"Tuesday----\"\n\n\"No, Wednesday,\" Alwynne persisted. \"Because, you know, Mr. Bryant is so\nafraid that Gertrude Clarke won't be out of the 'San.' He says he can\nnever coach up another Alkestis in the time. Besides, there isn't any\none. He's been tearing his hair.\"\n\nAlicia laughed.\n\n\"She knows more about it than I do, Roger! She's been half living there,\nhaven't you, Alwynne?\"\n\nRoger turned to her with a smile and the first touch of personal\ninterest that he had shown.\n\n\"Jolly place, isn't it? You teach, don't you? I wonder how it strikes\nyou!\"\n\nBut he was a stranger and Alwynne was nervous. She answered flippantly,\nas she always did when she was not at her ease--\n\n\"Oh, I can't get over their dresses! Appalling garments! Imagine that\npoor girl trying to rehearse Alkestis in a pea-green potato sack! It\nmust be delicious. And their hair! Doesn't anybody ever teach them to do\ntheir hair?\"\n\nHe eyed her thoughtfully, from her carefully dressed head to her\nshining shoe-buckles, and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Is that all you see?\" said Roger dispassionately, and withdrew\ninterest.\n\nAlwynne grew hot with annoyance. Idiot! All she saw.... As if she had\nmeant anything of the kind.... One said things like that.... One just\nsaid them.... Especially when one was nervous.... Taking a remark like\nthat seriously.... Oh well, if he liked to think her a fool--let him!\nSilly prig!\n\nShe endeavoured to put him out of her mind. But his mere existence\ndisturbed her. She was not accustomed to tobacco, for instance ... and\nit was disconcerting to find him in her favourite corner of the library\nor occupying the writing-table that no one had seemed to use but\nherself. He appeared to have forgotten that he had snubbed her and was\nunquenchably friendly. She found herself being pleasanter than she\nintended, but she made it a point of honour never to agree with him.\nThat, at least, she owed herself.\n\nShe watched him furtively, alert for justification of her ill-humour.\nShe told herself that it would be easier to be nice to him if everybody\nelse did not fuss over him so.... It was ridiculous to see how Jean,\nespecially, brightened at the sight of him.... He was good to her,\ncertainly: she was argumentative, without being shrewd, but he never\nlost patience, as Alwynne, in secret was inclined to do. Even Alicia, so\nstoutly the head of her household, submitted every difficulty, from an\nunexpected legacy to a dearth of eggs. And he would sit down solidly and\nthink the matter out. And his advice, from a flutter in rubber to pepper\nin the chicken pail, would be followed literally, and generally, Alwynne\nadmitted, with success.\n\nBut she jibbed furiously when the sisters began to consult him about her\npersonal affairs.\n\n\"Roger, don't you think that Alwynne----?\"\n\nBut here Roger was invariably offhand and non-committal. Curiously,\nhowever, this attitude, correct as it was, did not appease Alwynne. But\nshe was forced, at least, to admit that he could, on occasion, be\ntactful.\n\nThe last week of the term had begun. Alicia, at breakfast behind the\ncoffee urn, was making her plans.\n\n\"It's a busy week. The Swains want us to go to lunch, Jean, only we\nhaven't a day before Sunday, have we? At least--there's Tuesday; it's\nonly the dress-rehearsal. I can get out of that. Alwynne can represent\nme.\" She nodded benevolently.\n\nThere was a slight pause. Roger, glancing up, stared openly. Alwynne had\nturned as white as paper. Her words came stickily.\n\n\"Cousin Alice, I can't. I mean--I'd rather--I don't want to go much, if\nyou don't mind.\"\n\nAlicia blessed herself.\n\n\"But, my dear! Why not? I thought you'd be looking forward----Oh, I\nsuppose you've watched it so often, already.\"\n\n\"No--I haven't seen it; I'm afraid rehearsals bore me----\" Alwynne broke\noff with an attempt at a light laugh.\n\n\"But you've been up to Compton so much,\" Alicia's tone was reproachful.\n\"I should have thought you would have been sufficiently interested----\"\n\n\"Oh, I am! Only--you see I've got letters to write--to Elsbeth----\"\n\n\"Well, you've got all the week to write in! Are you so afraid of being\nbored? Compton wouldn't be flattered. We rather pride ourselves on our\nacting, you know! My dear, we're expected to go--must give the\nperformers some sort of an audience to get them into training for the\nnight. You ought to understand, of all people! Don't you ever give plays\nat your school?\"\n\nAlwynne was silent, but prompted by an instinct she could not have\nexplained, she turned to Roger, stolid behind his eggs and bacon. She\nsaid nothing, but she looked at him desperately. He gave an\nimperceptible nod. He had been watching her intently.\n\n\"But, dear Alwynne----\" Jean was chirruping her version of Alicia's\nremarks when Roger's calm voice interrupted--\n\n\"I say, Alicia! I thought you and Jean were coming with me! I can't go\non the night itself. Of course you must come. Go to your lunch on\nSunday--I'll look after Alwynne. But I'm not going up to Compton without\nyou. Spoil all the fun.\"\n\n\"Of course, if Roger wants us----\" began Jean quickly.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't want to miss it,\" retreated Alicia hastily. \"I only\nthought the Swains----But of course Sunday would do.\"\n\n\"I met old Swain yesterday,\" said Roger, \"travelled up to town with him.\nHe was very full of his daughter's engagement.\"\n\n\"Engagement!\" Alicia and Jean swooped to the news, like gulls to a\nfalling crust. It kept them busy till breakfast was over.\n\nAnd Roger returned to his eggs and bacon with never a glance at Alwynne.\n\nAlwynne, half an hour later in her own room, fighting certain memories,\narguing herself fiercely out of her weakness, had yet time to puzzle her\nhead over Roger Lumsden. How quick he had been--and how kind.... Or had\nhe noticed nothing? Had that adroit change of subject been accidental?\nThat was much more likely.\n\nShe dismissed him from her mind. She wished she could dismiss all the\nthoughts that filled her mind as easily.\n\nAlwynne was grateful enough to Roger, however, when Tuesday came and he\nset out for Compton, an aunt on either arm: but on Sunday she had to pay\nfor her non-attendance. Hurrying down, a little late, to lunch, she was\nhalf-way through her usual apologies before she realised that neither\nJean nor Alicia were in their places. Of course--they were going to the\nSwain's.... Their nephew, however, waiting gravely behind his chair,\nadmitted her excuses with a little air of acknowledging them to be\nnecessary that ruffled her at once, though she had promised herself to\nbe pleasant. After all, she was staying, as she had told herself several\ntimes already, with Jean and Alicia. Once more she applied herself,\nquite unsuccessfully, to snubbing his air of host. Roger listened to her\nin some amusement; her ungracious ways disturbed him no more than the\nrufflings and peckings of an angry bird, and her charming manner to his\naunts and occasional whim of friendliness to himself, had prevented him\nfrom pigeon-holing her definitely as a pretty young shrew. He was\ninclined to like her, for Jean and Alicia had confessed themselves\nabsurdly taken with the girl, and he was accustomed to be influenced by\ntheir judgment; but the touch of hostility that usually showed itself in\nher manner to him puzzled as much as it amused him.\n\nHe enjoyed baiting her, yet he thought, carelessly, that it was a pity\nshe should have inaugurated guerilla warfare. She looked as if she could\nhave been pleasant company for his spare time if she had chosen.\nHowever, he would have little enough spare time, for the next few weeks,\nanyhow ... he had promised Jean to set to work seriously at the\nrenovation of her garden.... He should be thankful for a visitor\nrequiring neither escort nor attention.\n\nYet, naturally, her independence piqued him. He eyed her swiftly, as she\nsat at his right hand. She was a curious girl, he thought, to be so\npretty and well-dressed, and yet so self-sufficing. Girls, apparently of\nher type, (he thought of his American cousins) usually needed a good\ndeal of admiration to keep them contented.\n\nShe did not look altogether contented, though ... there were lines and\npuckers at the corners of her large eyes, that were surely out of\nplace ... nineteen, wasn't she? She had had a breakdown, of course ...\nrather absurd, for such a child.... Jean had hinted a guess at some\ntrouble.... A love affair, he supposed. That would account for her\nthorniness, her occasional air of absence and depression, that\ncontrasted with her usual cheerfulness.... Yet that curious whim the\nother day--what had it meant? More than a whim, he imagined--her very\nlips had grown white.... He was quite sure that he had helped her out of\na hole.... She might at least show a certain decent gratitude.... He\nwondered what she was thinking about, sitting there so silently ... she\nwas generally talkative enough ... pretty quarrelsome, too. He supposed\nshe was having a fit of the blues.... He had better talk to her,\nperhaps....\n\nAlwynne, eating her wing of chicken, was merely and sheerly shy. She was\ngarrulous enough with women, but she did not in the least know how to\ntalk to men. Therefore and naturally she was full of theories. She had\nvague ideas that they had to be amused as babies have to be amused, but\nconfronted with the prospect of a prolonged _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_, without\nAlicia or Jean to retire upon, she had nothing whatever to say. Yet she\nhad been taught by Elsbeth to consider a lack of table-talk as a lack of\nmanners, and was irritated with herself for her silence, and still more\nirritated with Roger for his.\n\nShe met his belated attempts at a conversation none too graciously--was\nbored by the boat-race, and would have nothing to say to the weather;\nthough she thawed to his catalogue of copses and plantations in the\nneighbourhood, where certain wild flowers she had not yet discovered\nmight be found.\n\nBut it was impossible for Alwynne to be silent long, and by the time\nthey had adjourned to the drawing-room, the pair were talking easily\nenough. Roger did not find himself bored. He had, from the beginning,\nrecognised that she was no fool, that her remarks owed their comicality\nto her phrasing of them, and that essentially they were shrewd, her\nacrobatic intellect swinging easily across the gaps in her education.\nThe gaps were certainly there. He would marvel at her amazing ignorance,\nonly to be tripped up by her unexpected display of authoritative\nknowledge. Gradually he began to analyse and discriminate, to see that\nshe was naturally observant. Her remarks on life as she knew it, were as\nilluminating as original. She had humour and a nice sense of caricature.\nBut when she, as it were, hoisted herself on the shoulders of the women\nabout her, and from that level peered curiously at an outer, alien\nworld, her insight failed her, her views grew distorted and merely\ngrotesque. He thought he guessed the reason. She was no longer gazing,\ncritical and clear-eyed, at known surroundings, but, still supported by\nthe opinions of the women of her circle, was seeing what she had\nexpected to see, what she had been told by them that she would see.\n\nFor all her air of modern girl, her independence, her store of book\nexperience, she was comically conventual in her curiosities and\nintolerances, in her prim company manners and uncontrollable lapses into\nunconventionality. She had an air of not being at her ease; yet he\nguessed that it was merely the unaccustomed environment that disturbed\nher poise. He could see her handling surely enough a crowd of\nschoolgirls. He was equally certain that she ruled through sheer, easy\npopularity. She had dignity in spite of her whimsies, but he could not\nimagine her intimidating even a schoolgirl.\n\nBut most of all her attitude to himself amused him. She had a certain\nveiled antagonism of manner, that was allied to the antagonism of the\nsmall child to any innovation. She talked to him readily enough (and he,\nfor that matter, to her) yet she was always on the defensive,\ninquisitive yet wary. He felt that if she had been ten years younger,\nshe would have circled about him and poked.\n\nA stray phrase explained her to him.\n\nThey had discussed the latest raid. At Alwynne's age and period all\nconversational roads led to the suffrage question, and he had found her\nre-hash of Mona Hamilton's arguments sufficiently entertaining. He\nguessed a plagiarism of the matter, but the manner was obviously her\nown. She was full of second-hand indignation over the conduct of a\ncertain Cabinet Minister.\n\n\"He won't even see them!\" she explained grievously. \"Not even a\ndeputation from the constitutional section! Just because some women are\nfools--and burn things----\" The pause was eloquent. \"It's so utterly\nunreasonable,\" declaimed Alwynne. \"But of course men are unreasonable,\"\nsaid Alwynne, pensively reflective.\n\n\"Are they?\"\n\n\"All I know are, anyhow.\"\n\nHe considered her ingenuous countenance--\n\n\"If it's not a delicate question--how many do you know?\" said Roger\nsoftly.\n\nShe looked at him, mildly surprised.\n\n\"Hundreds! In books, that is.\"\n\n\"Oh--books! I meant real life.\"\n\n\"Surely a page of Shakespeare is more real than dozens of real people's\nlives.\"\n\n\"Side issue! I'm not to be deflected. How many men do you know, in real\nlife, well enough to discuss the suffrage with?\"\n\n\"I'm always kept at school the day the vicar comes to tea,\" she said\nsuggestively.\n\n\"Who else?\"\n\nShe saw his drift, but defended herself, smiling.\n\n\"The assistants are most intelligent at the circulating library.\"\n\n\"Who else?\"\n\n\"There were music masters at school. I didn't mean _you_ were\nunreasonable,\" she deprecated.\n\nHe began to laugh, openly, mischievously, delighting in her\ndiscomfiture.\n\n\"Anyhow, I know a lot about women,\" said Alwynne heatedly.\n\nHe eyed her respectfully.\n\n\"I'm sure you do. But we were talking of men. And on the whole--you\nmake me a polite exception--as a result of your wide knowledge, your\ncomplicated experience of Us--as a class--you consider that we are\nunreasonable?\"\n\nBut he spoke into space. Alwynne had retired, pinkly, to a sofa and a\nnovel. But he thought, as he settled to his own reading, that he heard a\nstrangled chuckle. Alwynne, caught napping, always tickled Alwynne.\n\nOver the top of his book, he considered her bent head approvingly. He\nliked her sense of fun. It was not every girl who could appreciate the\nsmut on her own nose ... quite a pretty nose too ... indeed the whole\nprofile was unexceptionable.... He noticed how well the patch of sky and\nthe slopes of Witch Hill framed it ... and her hair ... it regularly\nmopped up the sunlight! He felt that he wanted to take the great heavy\nrope and twist it like a wet cloth till the gold dropped out on to the\nfloor in shining pools.\n\nHe supposed she would be called a beautiful woman.... He had always\nlooked upon a beautiful woman as an improbable possibility, like a\nmillionaire or an archbishop--whom you might meet any day, but somehow\nnever did.... Yet he was in the same house with one--and she his\nsemi-demi cousin.... Yes--she was certainly beautiful....\n\nHere Alwynne, who had not been entirely absorbed, looked up and caught\nhis eye. Neither quite knew how to meet the other's unexpected scrutiny.\nRoger, less agile than Alwynne, stared solemnly until she looked away.\n\nAlwynne gave a little inaudible sigh. She was boring him, of course....\nIt was pretty obvious.... Yet he had been quite nice all through\nlunch.... It was a pity.... She wondered if he wanted to read, or if she\nought to go on talking? She racked her brains for something to say to\nhim. It was not so easy to talk if he would not do his share.... She\nsupposed she had talked too much about the suffrage.... Men never liked\nto be contradicted.... She glanced at him swiftly, and met his look once\nmore, and once more he stared, till her dropping lids released him.\nThen he lit his pipe.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\nShe thought it very rude of him to leave off talking.... Silence was\noppressive unless you knew people well.... It snubbed you.... Especially\nwhen you had been, as Alwynne feared she had, holding forth a trifle....\nShe supposed he had put her down as a talkative bore.... Elsbeth always\nsaid that strangers thought her enthusiasms were pose ... as if it\nmattered what strangers thought! She hated strangers.... She was always\nfantastic with new acquaintances.... It was the form her shyness took.\nIf Roger chose to think she was posing.... It didn't affect her\nanyway.... She was only too glad to be able to read in peace.... Hang\nRoger!\n\nShe settled herself to her reading.\n\nFor five long minutes they both read steadily. But Alwynne's book was\nnot interesting; she began to flutter the pages, her thoughts once more\nastray.\n\nIt was rather a shame of The Dears to desert her ... to leave her to\nentertain a strange man who didn't like her.... It made her look a\nfool.... She hated boring people.... If she bored their precious nephew\nas much as the book on her lap bored her!... She wondered why, with all\nthe library to choose from, she had pitched on it. Of course, it was\nRoger's suggestion.... Well, she didn't think much of his taste.... Or\nperhaps he imagined it was the sort of stuff to appeal to her? She flung\nup her chin indignantly, to find his serious and critical eyes once more\nconcerned with her. She met them with a raising of eyebrows--a hint of\ncool defiance. It was Roger's turn to retire into his book.\n\nHe was an odd sort of a man.... She wondered what Clare would think of\nhim? As if Clare would bother her head.... But then he wasn't Clare's\ncousin. But Clare would be out in the woods after the wild hyacinths....\nSomebody had said it was blue with them in the little wood behind the\nhouse.... She must send Clare a boxful to-morrow ... or to-day? She\nsupposed there was an evening post.... It was a pity to waste such a\nheavenly afternoon....\n\nShe stole yet another glance at Roger; he was evidently engrossed at\nlast. It would not be rude? After all, what did it matter? He wasn't too\npolite himself! She drove her book viciously down the yielding side of\nthe Chesterfield, swished to the open French window, and so out. The\ngravel crunched moistly beneath her thin shoes; she could feel every\npebble. She glanced back into the drawing-room. All quiet. But by the\ntime she had changed, the man might have come out.... She would change\nafterwards.... The smooth lawn sloped invitingly--beyond lay the rose\nwalk and the wood, little Witch Wood that she had never yet explored,\njust because it was always at hand.\n\nShe picked up her silken skirts and took to her heels.\n\nIt was exactly half an hour later that Roger's book also grew dull to\nthe point of imbecility. He shut it with a bang, stirred the sun-drowned\nfire, and knocked out his pipe against the shining dogs. Then he too\nwalked out on to the terrace.\n\nHe wondered where the girl had got to. Then he frowned. Little\nhalf-moons dinted the wet yellow path and the stretch of grass beyond\nit. It was very careless, cutting up the turf like that.... If there was\none thing he hated.... Of course she was town-bred ... could not be\nexpected to realise the sacredness of a lawn.... But he must certainly\ntell her.... He might as well find her and tell her at once.... Then he\nlaughed. Alwynne's high heels had betrayed her. The tracks led straight\nto the wood. So that was the lure.... He remembered saying that the\nhyacinths would probably be out....\n\nHe wondered if she knew her way.... It wasn't a large wood.... Perhaps\nhe had better go and see ... and warn her off the lawn coming back? He\nhesitated. His eyes fell on Jean's forgotten bodge, lying by the\nborder. If the hyacinths were out, she would need a basket.... She had\nnot taken one.... Trust her to forget such a detail.... She would be\nglad of it though.... He tipped out the weeds into a neat pile and\njumping the narrow bed, ran down in his turn, towards the wood.\n\nAlicia and Jean, home to tea, were annoyed to find the fire out.\n\nThe gardener, rolling the lawn next day, thought as ill of hobnailed\nboots as of high French heels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nAlwynne left the garden behind her and crossed the stretch of grass,\nhalf lawn, half paddock, that lay between kitchen-garden and wood. It\nwas fenced with riotous hedges, demure for the moment in dove-grey\nhoneysuckle and star of Bethlehem, with no hint in their puritan apparel\nof the brionies and eglantines that were to follow. About the hedge\nborders the grass grew tall and rank, and, as she watched, the wind\nwould stir it into a sea of emerald and the parsley-blossoms sway above\nit like snatches of drifting foam. Beyond the hedge shadow, \"Nicholas\nNye,\" the one-eyed donkey, reposed Celestially among the buttercups,\nwhich, making common cause with the afternoon sun, had turned his\ngrazing ground into a Field of the Cloth of Gold.\n\nFor a moment she was minded to content herself with all the buttercups\non earth to gather, and to go no further that day; but staring down the\ndazzling slope, her eyes rested once more upon the pleasant darkness of\nthe goal for which she had been bound. Among the nearer tree trunks were\nstripes and chequerings of blue--the blue that is lovelier than the sea,\nthe one blue in the world to the flower-lover. At once, indifferently,\nshe left the buttercups to Nicholas Nye and hurried on and into the\nwood.\n\nThere were hyacinths everywhere, hyacinths by the million. It was as if\nthe winds had torn her robes from the faint, spring sky, and had flung\nthem to earth, and she now bent above them naked and shivering.\n\nAlwynne wandered from patch to patch in an ecstasy of delight. As usual,\nher pleasure shaped itself into exclamations, phrases, whole sentences\nof the letters she would write to Clare Hartill of her experiences. If\nonly she could have Clare with her, she thought, to see and hear and\ntouch and smell--to share the loveliness she was enjoying. Her thoughts\nflew to Italy, to their crowded month of beautiful sights together. She\nlaughed--she would discard all those memories for love of this present\nvision.... If only Clare could see it.... She could never describe it\nproperly ... adjectives welled up in her mind and dispersed again, like\nbubbles in a glass of water. The stalks and the hoarse ring of the\nhyacinth bells fascinated her. Clare was forgotten. She began to pick\nfor the sake of picking.\n\nThe hot silence of early afternoon lay upon tree and bird and air.\nAlwynne, moving from blue clump to blue clump, grew ashamed of the\nrustle of her dress and the scrunch of twigs and soaked leaves beneath\nher feet, and trod softly; even her own calm breathing sounded too\nloudly for the perfect peace of the place and the hour.\n\nShe picked steadily, greedily--she had never before had as many flowers\nas she wanted, and there was inexpressible pleasure in filling her arms\ntill she could hold no more; yet, some twenty minutes later, as she\nstraightened herself at last, a little giddily, and looked about her\nover the pile of azure bells, there was no sign of bareness, for all she\nhad gathered; she still stood to her knees in a lake of blue and green\nand gold.\n\nShe stretched herself lazily as she considered the flowers about her and\nwondered at their luxuriance. They were thicker and longer-stemmed than\nthe mass of those she carried: the leaves were juicy and shining like\ndark swords: the last dozen of her armful had flecked her hands and\ndress with milky syrup. The ground, too, was black and boggy, and sucked\nat her feet as she moved. Suddenly she realised that the trees grew\nthick and close together--that the patches of sunlight were far\napart--and that she had wandered farther into the wood than she had\nintended. She thought that she had picked enough, more than enough for\nElsbeth as well as Clare; that it was time to be getting home. She had\nno idea of the hour.... It would not do to risk being late....\n\nShe moved forward uncertainly.\n\nShe had had a blessed afternoon: she had surrendered herself to the\nsounds and sights and smells of the spring, to the warmth of the sun and\nthe touch of the wind, till every sense was drunken with pleasure. But\nher ecstasy had been impersonal and thoughtless: she had enjoyed too\ncompletely to have had knowledge of her enjoyment. With the return to\nrealisation of place and time, her mood was changing. She was no longer\nof the wood, but in it merely; wandering in the dark heart of it, no\ndryad returned and welcome, but a stranger, one Alwynne Durand, in thin\nshoes and an unsuitable dress, with the wood's flowers, not her own, in\nher hands. Stolen flowers--their weight was suddenly a burden to her.\nShe felt guilty, and had an odd, sudden wish to put them down tenderly\nat the foot of a tree, hide them with grasses and run for her life. She\nlaughed at the idea as she looked for the path--what were flowers for,\nbut picking? Yet she could not get rid of the feeling that she had been\ndoing wrong, and that even now she was being watched, and would, in due\ntime, be caught and punished, her stolen treasures still in her hands.\n\nBut wild flowers are free to all--and the wood was Roger Lumsden's wood!\nHe had told her that he rented it.\n\nShe moved backwards and forwards, turning hurriedly hither and thither,\ntrampling the hyacinths and stumbling on the uneven ground, unreasonably\nflurried that she could not find any path. She could not even track her\nown footsteps.\n\nIt was very strange, she thought, when she had penetrated so easily the\ndepths of the wood, that the return should be so difficult. She had\nthought it a mere copse. She put her free hand to her eyes, scanning the\nwall of greenery in all directions. She fancied that at one point the\ntrees grew less densely, and set out, scrambling over rough ground\ntowards the faint light.\n\nBut in spite of her hurry she advanced slowly. The thin switches of the\nundergrowth whipped her as she pushed them aside, and the huge briars\ntwisted themselves about her like live things. Twice the slippery moss\nbrought her to her knees, and the faint light grew no stronger as she\npressed forward. She began to feel frightened, though she knew the\nsensation to be absurd. It was impossible to be lost in a little wood,\nhalf a mile across.... It was merely a question of walking straight on\ntill one emerged on open fields....\n\nShe told herself so, and tried to be amused at her adventure, and hummed\na confident little tune as she plodded on, very careful not to look\nbehind her. Her shoes, thudding and squelching in the wet mess of mould\nand green stuff, made more noise than one would have thought possible\nfor one pair of feet, and woke the oddest echoes.\n\nOf course, it was impossible that any one could be following her.... But\nthe wood was so horribly silent that her own breathing and clumsy\nfootfalls (there could be nothing else) counterfeited the noises of\npursuit.... She could have sworn there was a presence at her elbow, in\nher rear, moving as she moved, stumbling as she stumbled. Twice she\nfaced round abruptly, standing still--but she saw nothing but the wall\nof vegetation, motionless, silent, yet insistently alive. She felt that\nevery tree, every leaf, every blade of grass, was watching her with\ngreen, unwinking eyes. There was nothing more in the wood than there had\nbeen a pleasant hour ago--less indeed, for she realised suddenly that\nthe sun had gone in and that it was cold; yet she owned to herself at\nlast that she was nervous, vaguely uneasy. Instantly, by that mere act\nof recognition, fright was born in her--unreasonable and unreasoning\nfright, that, in the length of a thought, pervaded her entire\npersonality, crisping her hair, catching at her throat, paralysing her\nmind. The wood-panic had her in its grip--the age-old terror that still\nlies in wait where trees are gathered together, though the god that\nbegot it be dead these nineteen hundred years.\n\nShe began to run.\n\nIt was impossible to pass quickly through the tangled undergrowth; but\nsheer fright gave her skill to avoid real obstacles, strength to crash\nover and through the mere wreckage of the wood. She turned and doubled\nlike a hare, yet desperately, with the hare's terror of the sudden turn\nthat might confront her with the presence at her heels. She could endure\nits pursuit, but she knew that its revelation would be more than she\ncould bear. She was so far merely and indefinitely frightened, but to\nface the unknown would be to confront fear itself. And she was more\nfrightened of fear than of any evil she knew. She could, she thought,\nmeet pain or sickness, or any mere misery, with sufficient calmness, but\nthe fear of fear was an obsession. She tore through the wood, shaken and\ngasping with terror of the greater terror she every moment expected to\nbe forced to undergo; for almost the only clear thought remaining to\nher, in that onrush of panic, was the realisation that there was, at her\nelbow, in her heart, physical or metaphysical, she knew not which, some\nas yet veiled fact waiting to be revealed, in view of which her present\nagitation was trivial and meaningless.\n\nShe ran on, blind and blundering; yet her feet were so clogged by the\nweight of earth and wet, her thoughts by the sweat of the fear that was\non them, that neither seemed to move for all her willing. And all the\nwhile, another part of her consciousness sat aloof, critical and\ndetached, laughing at her for an excitable fool, analysing, in Clare's\ncrispest accents, the illusions which were bewildering her, and\nwondering coolly that any girl of her age could so let her imagination\nrun away with her.\n\nShe pulled herself together with an immense effort of will.\n\nThat was the truth.... It was her own imagination that was literally\nand physically running away with her, whipping her tired body into\nunnecessary exertion, flogging her into mad flight from this pleasant,\nharmless place, with its hideous and horrible suggestion of evil at\nhand.... But the evil was in her own mind.... There was nothing pursuing\nher, no vague ghost at her elbow.... The horror was in herself, to be\nfaced, and fought, and trampled.... Running would not help her ... she\nwould only carry her terror with her.... For an instant she had a\nlightning glimpse of the reasons of the Sadducean attitude to\npersonality, and its desperate denials of future existence. She was\nsuddenly appalled at the hideous possibility of existing eternally with\nher own undying thoughts for company. She wondered if there were really\nsuch a thing as soul suicide, and thought that, if so, many must have\nchosen to commit it.\n\nHere her shifting, crowding thoughts blotted out the glimmer of\nunderstanding, as flies clustering on a window-pane can blot out light;\nyet the word _suicide_ remained in her mind, disturbing, vaguely\nsuggestive. It was connected with something terrible--she could not\nremember what--that in its turn was one with the vague horror at her\nelbow, that walked with the echo of her footsteps and panted with the\nechoes of her breaths, and yet was not real at all, but only in her\nmind.\n\nShe did not believe she should ever find her way out of the wood.... The\nhyacinths in her arms were so heavy--a queerly familiar weight: and the\nsun had gone in, which had, somehow, something to do with the\ntrouble.... She felt the black depression of the winter months that she\nhad left Utterbridge to escape settling down on her once more. She\nturned hopelessly to elude it, but it surrounded her like a fog, as\nindeed she half believed it to be. She supposed they had sudden fogs in\nthe country, when the sun went in.... And the sun had gone in because\nshe had picked all the hyacinths.... She remembered the story clearly\nenough now.... The sun had played at quoits with a child, and had\nthrown amiss, and killed it, and the purple blood had trickled down from\nthe child's forehead.... So the sun had turned it into purple\nhyacinths.... But she, Alwynne, had been gathering all the hyacinths,\nand they were a heavy bunch, heavy as a dead child's body ... and in\nanother minute they would be disenchanted, and she would be carrying a\ndead child's body in her arms....\n\nShe stood still, gazing down at the flowers, white and glassy-eyed with\nterror, wondering that she was still alive and not yet mad. For she knew\nthat the fear she had feared was upon her at last. She dared not blink\nlest in that second the change should take place, and she should find\nLouise, long buried, in her arms. Because, of course, it was Louise who\nhad been following her all the while.... Louise--who had committed\nsuicide.... She was following Alwynne, because it was Alwynne's\nfault.... Clare had said so.... Well--at least she could tell Louise\nthat she had meant no harm....\n\nShe waited, swayed back against a tree trunk, the flowers a dead weight\nover her arm. She held them gently, lest a rough movement should wake\nthe horror they hid. With what was left of sanity she prayed.\n\nThe trees encircled her, watching. From far away there came once more a\nsound of footsteps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nRoger set out at a quick pace for the wood, the basket rattling lightly\non his arm; but the track of Alwynne's shoes was lost in the deep grass\nof the paddock, and he hesitated, wondering where he should look for\nher. Followed a cupboard-love scene with Nicholas Nye, who accompanied\nhim to the boundary of his kingdom, snuffling windily in the empty\nbodge. He brayed disgustedly when Roger left him, his ancient lips\ncurling backward over yellow stumps, in a smile that was an insult. He\nhad the air of knowing exactly where Roger was going, and of being\nleeringly amused.\n\nFor ten minutes Roger wandered about, starting aside from the pathway\nhalf a dozen times, deceived by a swaying branch, or the deceptive pink\nand white of distant birch bark. He tramped on into the thickness of the\nwood, till at last, through a thinning of trees, a hundred yards to his\nleft, he caught a glimpse of gold, that could only, he told himself, be\nAlwynne's hair. He frowned. It was just like the girl to go floundering\ninto the only boggy bit of the wood, when two thirds were drained and\ndry, and thick with flowers.... It was sheer spirit of contradiction!\nShe would catch cold of course; and he would, not to mince matters, be\nstunk out with eucalyptus for the next ten days ... and The Dears would\nfuss ... he knew them! His fastidiousness was always revolted by a\nparade of handkerchiefs and bleared eyes. He was accustomed to insist\nthat disease was as disgraceful as dirt: and that there was not a pin to\nchoose between Dartmoor and the London Hospital as harbourage for\ncriminals. But he could always dismount from his hobby-horse for any\ncase of suffering that came his way. He could give his time, his money,\nor his tenderness, with a matter-of-course promptitude that relieved all\nbut a tender-skinned few of any belief that they had reason to be\ngrateful to him.\n\nRoger, his eye on the distant halo, crashed through the undergrowth at a\ngreat rate, emerging into a little natural clearing, to find Alwynne\nfacing him, a bare half-dozen yards away.\n\nThe full sight of her pulled him up short.\n\nShe was standing--lying upright, rather, for she seemed incapable of\nself-support--flattened against a big grey oak. One arm, flung\nbackwards, clutched and scrabbled at the bark; the other, crooked\nshelteringly, supported a mass of bluebells. Her face was grey, her\nmouth half open, her eyes wide and pale. Very obviously she did not see\nhim.\n\n\"Alwynne!\" he exclaimed.\n\nShe cowered. He exclaimed again, astonished and not a little alarmed----\n\n\"Alwynne! Are you ill? What on earth has happened?\"\n\nShe flung up her head, staring.\n\n\"Roger?\" she said incredulously.\n\nThen her face began to work. He never forgot the expression of relief\nthat flowed across it. It was like the breaking up of a frozen pool.\n\n\"Why, it's you!\" cried Alwynne. \"It's you! It's only you!\" The flowers\ndropped lingeringly from her slack hands, and she swayed where she\nstood. He crossed hastily to her and she clung helplessly to his arm.\nShe looked dazed and stupid.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" he said. \"Who did you think it was?\"\n\nAlwynne looked at him.\n\n\"Louise,\" she said, \"I thought it was Louise. She's come before, but\nnever in the daytime. A ghost can't walk in the daytime. But this place\nis so dark, she might think it was night here, don't you think?\"\n\nHe gave her arm a gentle shake.\n\n\"Let's get out of this, Alwynne,\" he began persuasively. \"I think you're\nrather done for. There's been a hot sun to-day, and you've been stooping\ntill you're dizzy. Come on. What a lot of flowers you've picked! Come,\nlet's get out of this place.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said; \"let's get out of this place.\"\n\n\"What about your bunch?\" he questioned, glancing down at the hyacinths'\nheaped disorder. \"Don't you want it?\"\n\nHe felt her shiver.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"no.\" She hesitated. \"Could we hide it? Cover it up? It\nought to be buried. I can't leave it--just lying there----\" There was a\ncatch in her voice.\n\nHe concealed his astonishment and looked about him.\n\n\"Of course not,\" he said cheerfully. \"Here--what about this?\"\n\nA huge tussock of bleached grass, its sodden leaves as long as a woman's\nhair, caught his eye. He parted the heavy mass and showed her the little\ncave of dry soil below.\n\n\"What about this? They'll be all right here,\" he suggested gravely.\n\nAlwynne nodded.\n\n\"Yes--put it in quickly,\" she said.\n\nWithout a word, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, he\ndid as she asked. Then, rising and slipping her arm through his own, he\npushed on quite silently, holding back the strong pollard shoots,\nclearing aside the brambles, till they reached the uneven footpath once\nmore, that led them in less than five minutes to the further edge of the\nwood. As they emerged into the open fields, he felt the weight on his\narm lessening. He glanced at his companion, and saw that there was once\nmore a tinge of colour in her cheek.\n\nShe drew a deep breath and looked at him.\n\n\"I thought I should never get out again,\" she said dispassionately, as\none stating a bald fact.\n\n\"Get where?\"\n\n\"Out of that wood. You were just in time. I thought I was caught. I\nshould have been, if you hadn't come.\"\n\nThen she grew conscious of his expression, and answered it--\n\n\"I suppose you think I'm mad.\"\n\n\"I do rather.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. It doesn't much matter----\" Her voice flagged and\nstrained.\n\nThey walked on in silence.\n\nShe began again abruptly.\n\n\"Of course you thought I was mad. I knew you would. I do myself,\nsometimes. Any one would. Even Clare. That's why I never told any one.\nBut it never happened when I was awake before.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you would tell me exactly what happened?\"\n\n\"I was frightened,\" she began irresolutely.\n\n\"For a moment I wondered if a tramp----\"\n\nShe laughed shakily.\n\n\"I'm a match for the average tramp, I think. I'm head of the games.\"\n\nHe was amused.\n\n\"You'd tell him what you thought of him, I'm sure.\"\n\nBut already her smile had grown absent; she was relapsing into her\nabstraction.\n\nThey had crossed the field as they talked, and struck into the little\ngravelled path that led to the monster glass-houses on the other side of\nthe hedge. A wide gate barred their progress. Roger manipulated the\nrusty chain in silence for a moment, then, as the gate yawned open,\nturned to her pleasantly----\n\n\"Won't you have a look round, as we've come so far? You're in my\nterritory now, and I've a houseful of daffodils just bursting.\"\n\nHis calm matter-of-fact manner had its effect. Alwynne absorbed in her\nsick thoughts, found herself listening to his account of his houses and\nhis experiments, as one listens subconsciously to the slur of a distant\nwater-course. She did not take in the meaning of his words, but his\neven voice soothed her fretted nerves.\n\nRoger was perfectly aware of her inattention. He was not brilliant, but\nhe was equipped with experience and common-sense and kindness of heart;\nand above all he was observant. The Alwynne of his acquaintance, pretty,\namusing, clever, had attracted him sufficiently, had even, as he\nadmitted to himself as he went in search of her, been able to entice him\nfrom his Sunday comfort to wander quarrelling in wet fields. But the\nAlwynne he had come upon half-an-hour later was a revelation; at a\nglance every preconceived notion of her character was swept away.\n\nHis first idea was that she had been frightened by roughs, but her\nmanner and expression speedily contradicted it. She was, he perceived,\nstruggling, and not for the first time, with some overwhelming trouble\nof the mind. He had been appalled by the fear in her eyes. He remembered\nJean's account. Elsbeth had been worried about her for a long time:\nill-health and depression: she believed there had been some sort of a\nshock--a child had died suddenly at the school....\n\nAlwynne's gay and piquant presence had made him forget, till that\nmoment, such rudiments of her history as he had heard. But seeing her\ndistress, he was angry that he had been obtuse, and amazed at her skill\nin concealing whatever trouble it might be that was oppressing her. All\nthe kindliness of his nature awoke at sight of her haunted, hunted air;\nhe bestirred himself to allay her agitation; he resolved then and there\nto help her if he could.\n\nHe had recognised at once that she was in no state for argument or\nexplanation, and had devoted himself to calming her, falling in with her\nhumour, and showing no surprise at the extravagance of her remarks. He\nhad her quieted, almost herself, by the time they had reached his\nnursery and descended brick steps into a bath of sweet-smelling warmth.\n\nAlwynne exclaimed.\n\nThe glass-house was very peaceful. Above a huge Lent lily the spring's\nfirst butterfly hovered and was still awhile, then quivered again and\nfluttered away, till his pale wings grew invisible against the aisles of\nyellow bloom. The short, impatient barks of Roger's terrier outside the\ndoor came to them, dulled and faint. The sun poured down upon the\nalready heated air.\n\nAlwynne walked down the long narrow middle way, hesitating, enjoying,\nand moving on again, much, Roger thought, as the butterfly had done. She\nsaid little, but her delight was evident. Roger was pleased; he liked\nhis flowers to be appreciated. But he, too, said little; he was\nconsidering his course of action.\n\nAt the end of the conservatory was a square of brick flooring on which\nstood a table with a tobacco jar, and a litter of magazines; beside it\nan ancient basket-chair. Roger pulled it forward.\n\n\"This is my sanctum,\" he said. \"Won't you sit down? I do a lot of work\nhere in the winter.\"\n\nAlwynne sank into the creaking wicker-work with a sigh of relief.\n\n\"I shall never get up again,\" she said. \"It's too comfortable. I'm\ntired.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" He smiled at her. \"Don't you worry. You needn't budge till\nyou want to. I'll get some tea.\"\n\n\"You mustn't bother. It'll be cold. It's miles to the house,\" said\nAlwynne wearily.\n\nHe made no answer, but began to clear away the rubbish on the table. He\nmoved deftly, light-footed, without clumsy or unnecessary noise; in\nspite of his size, his movements were always silent and assured.\n\nShe closed her eyes indifferently. She had said that she was tired; the\nword was as good as another where none were adequate to express her\nutter exhaustion. She felt that, in a sense, she was in luck to be so\ntired that she could not think.... She knew that later she must brace\nherself to an examination of the nightmare experience of the afternoon,\nto renew her struggle against the devils of her imagination; but for the\nmoment her weakness was her safe-guard, and she could lie relaxed and\nthoughtless, mesmerised by the flooding sunshine and the pulsing scents\nand the quick movements of the man beside her. She wondered what he was\ndoing, but she was too tired to open her eyes, or to interpret to\nherself the faint sounds she heard. She thought dreamily that he was as\nkind as Elsbeth. She was grateful to him for not talking to her. He was\na wonderfully understanding person.... He might have known her for\nyears.... He made her feel safe ... that was a great gift.... If she,\nAlwynne, had been like that, kind and reassuring, to poor little\nLouise--if only she had understood--Louise would have come to her, then,\ninstead of brooding herself to death.... Poor Louise.... Poor unhappy\nLouise.... And after all she had not been able to kill herself.... She\nwas still alive, lying in wait for her, though she knew that Alwynne\ncould not help her.... She would never go away, though they had left her\noutside in the cold--in the cold of the wood--and were safe in this warm\nsummerland ... she would be waiting when they came out again.... She\nshuddered as she thought of retracing her steps. She would ask Roger to\ntake her home another way.... She would not have to explain.... He had\nnot wanted explanation.... She was passionately grateful to him because\nhe had not overwhelmed her with questions at their meeting. She could\nnever explain, of course, because people would think her mad.... They\nmight even send her to an asylum, if she told them.... She longed for\nthe relief of confession, yet who would believe that she was merely a\nsane woman rendered desperate by evil dreams? Not Clare, certainly--not\nElsbeth, though they loved her.... She would just have to go on fighting\nher terrors as best she could, till she or they were crushed....\n\nShe sighed hopelessly and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Had a doze? Good! Tea's ready! I expect you want it,\" said Roger\ncheerfully.\n\nShe was surprised into normality, and began to smile as she looked about\nher.\n\nThe rickety table had been covered by a gay, chequered cloth. There was\ncrockery, and a little green tea-pot, and a pile of short-bread at her\nelbow. A spirit-lamp and kettle were shelved incongruously between trays\nof daffodils.\n\nRoger sat upon an upturned flower-pot, and beamed at her.\n\n\"Oh, how jolly!\" cried Alwynne, the Alwynne once more of his former\nacquaintance. \"Where did it come from?\"\n\nHe showed her a cupboard against the wall, half hidden by a canopy of\nsmilax.\n\n\"I always keep stores here,\" he confessed boyishly. \"I used to when I\nwas a kid. This is the old glass-house, you know, on Great House land.\nI've built all the others. I used to be Robinson Crusoe then, and now\nit's useful, when I'm busy, not to have to go up to the house always.\nWon't you pour out?\"\n\nAlwynne flashed a look at him.\n\n\"I don't believe it's that. You enjoy the--the marooning still. I\nshould. I think it's perfectly delightful here.\"\n\n\"Well, Harris--my head-gardener--doesn't approve. Thinks it's _infra\ndig_. He told me once that he knew ladies enjoyed making parlours of\ntheir conservatories, and letting in draughts and killing the plants;\nbut he was a nursery-man himself. However, I've broken him in to it. Oh,\nI say, there's no milk!\"\n\n\"I don't take it. Clare--a friend of mine--never does, so I've got\naccustomed to it.\" She drank thirstily. \"Oh, it's good! I didn't know I\nwanted my tea so.\"\n\n\"I did,\" he said significantly.\n\nShe coloured painfully: she would not look at him.\n\n\"I was very tired,\" she said lamely.\n\n\"Were you?\" he asked her. \"You weren't gone half an hour. Do you know\nit's only half-past three?\"\n\nHe was very gentle; but she felt herself accused. She played uneasily\nwith her rope of beads as she chose her words. Roger, for all his\nintentness, could not help noticing how white and slender her hands\nshowed, stained though they were with hyacinth-milk, as they fingered\nthe blue, glancing chain. They were thin though; and following the\noutline of her wrist and arm and bare neck, he thought her cheek, for\nall its smooth youthfulness, was thin also, too thin--altogether too\naustere, for her age and way of life. She had always been flushed in his\npresence, delightfully flushed with laughter, or anger, or\nembarrassment, and he had noticed nothing beyond her pretty colour. But\nnow, he saw uneasily that there were hollows round her eyes, as if she\nslept little, and that there were hollows as well as dimples in her\ncheeks. He was astonished to find himself not a little perturbed at his\ndiscovery, so perturbed that he did not, for a moment, realise that she\nwas speaking to him.\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" she was saying. \"I'm afraid you thought--I'm afraid I\nwas rather silly--in the wood. I was disturbed when you found me.\" Her\nwords came jerkily. \"I had not expected--that is--I did not expect----\"\nShe broke off. Her eyes implored him to leave her alone.\n\nHe would not understand their appeal.\n\n\"Yes, you expected----\" he prompted her.\n\nShe controlled her voice with difficulty.\n\n\"Heavens knows!\" She laughed, with a pitiful little air of throwing him\noff the scent. \"One gets frightened for no reason sometimes.\"\n\n\"Does one?\"\n\n\"In the country--I'm town-bred.\" She smiled at him.\n\nHe made up his mind, though he felt brutal.\n\n\"You were expecting--Louise?\"\n\nThere was a silence. Slowly she lifted shaking hands, warding him off.\n\n\"No, no!\" she said. \"For pity's sake. You are calling her back.\" Then,\nstruck with a new idea, she grew, if possible, whiter still. \"Unless,\"\nshe said, whispering, \"you saw her--you too? Then there is no hope. I\nthought it was in my mind--only in my mind--but if you saw her too----\"\nHer voice failed.\n\nHe thrust in hastily, ready enough to comfort her, but knowing well that\nthe time had not come. Yet he felt like a surgeon at his first\noperation.\n\n\"No, you are mistaken. There was no one. I don't even know who Louise\nis. Only you mentioned her--once or twice, you see.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" she said. Then, with an effort at a commonplace tone: \"I was\nstupidly upset. You must excuse----\"\n\nHe broke in.\n\n\"Who is Louise?\" he asked her bluntly.\n\n\"A ghost,\" said Alwynne, white to the lips.\n\nAgain they were blankly silent.\n\nThen she spoke, with extraordinary passion--\n\n\"If you laugh--it will be wicked if you laugh at me.\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking of laughing,\" he said, with the petulance of extreme\nanxiety.\n\nShe met his look and shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Then you think I'm crazy,\" she began defiantly. \"I can't help it, what\nyou think.\" She changed the subject transparently. \"Roger, it's nice\nhere. What are the names of all these flowers? Are those big ones\ndaffodils, or jonquils, or narcissi? I never know the difference. I\nnever remember----\" Her voice trailed into silence.\n\n\"But look here,\" he began, and stopped again abruptly, deep in thought.\n\nThe flame of the spirit-lamp on the shelf between them flickered and\nfailed, and sputtered up again noisily. Mechanically he rose to\nextinguish it, and, still absently, cleared the little table of its\nchina and eatables.\n\nThen he sat down once more, and leant forward, his arms on the table,\nhis expression determined, yet very friendly.\n\n\"Alwynne,\" he said, in his most matter-of-fact voice, \"hadn't you better\ntell me all about it?\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" he said comfortably. \"You'll feel ever so much better if you\nget if off your chest.\"\n\nFor an instant she hesitated: then she shook her head wearily.\n\n\"I would like to tell some one. But I can't. I sound mad, even to\nmyself. I couldn't tell any one. I couldn't tell Elsbeth even.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" he agreed. \"You can't worry your own people.\"\n\n\"No, you can't, can you?\" she said, grateful for his comprehension.\n\n\"Of course not. But you see--I'm different. Whatever your trouble is, it\nwon't worry me--because I don't care for you like Elsbeth and your\nfriends. So you can just ease off on me--d'you see? If I do think you\nmad, it just doesn't matter, does it? What does it matter telling some\none a secret when you'll never see them again? Don't you see?\" he argued\nreassuringly.\n\nShe nodded dumbly. The cheerful, impersonal kindness of his voice and\nair made her want to cry. She realised how she had been aching for\nsympathy.\n\n\"Don't you see?\" he repeated.\n\n\"You wouldn't make fun?\" she asked him. \"You wouldn't tell any one? You\nwouldn't talk me over?\"\n\n\"No, Alwynne,\" he said gravely.\n\nFor a moment her eyes searched his face wistfully; then with sudden\ndecision, she began to speak.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nAlwynne's words, after the months of silence, came rushing out, breaking\ndown all barriers, sweeping on in unnatural fluency. Yet she was simple\nand direct, entirely sincere; accepting him at his own valuation,\nimpersonally, as confessor and comforter, without a side glance at the\nimpression she might make, or its effect on their after relations.\n\nShe told him the story of Louise; and he felt sick as he listened.\nUnintentionally, for she was obviously absorbed in her school and\nuncritical in her attitude to it, she gave him a vivid enough impression\nof the system in force, of the deliberate encouragement of much that he\nconsidered unhealthy, if not unnatural. He detected an hysterical\ntendency in the emulations and enthusiasms to which she referred. The\ngardener in him revolted at the thought of such congestion of minds and\nbodies. He felt as indignant as if he had discovered a tray of unthinned\nseedlings. Alwynne conveyed to him, more clearly than she knew, an idea\nof the forcing-house atmosphere that she, and those still younger than\nshe, had been breathing. The friend she so constantly mentioned,\nrepelled him; he thought of her with distaste, as of an unscrupulous and\nunskilful hireling; he was amazed at the affection of Alwynne's\nreferences to her. Only in connection with the dead child was there a\nhint of uncertainty in her attitude. There perhaps, she admitted, had\n\"Clare\" been, not unkind--never and impossibly unkind--but perhaps, with\nthe best of motives, mistaken. She had not understood Louise. Roger\nagreed silently and grimly enough. She had not understood Louise, whom\nshe had killed, nor this loyal and affectionate child, whom she was\ndriving into melancholia, nor any one it appeared, nor anything, but the\nneeds of her own barrenly emotional nature.... He was horrified at the\nidea of such a woman, such a type of woman, in undisputed authority,\nmoulding the mothers of the next generation.... He had never considered\nthe matter seriously, but he supposed she was but one of many.... There\nmust be something poisonous in a system that could render possible the\nplacing of such women in such positions....\n\n\"Then what happened, after that poor child's death?\" he asked. \"She\nleft, of course?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Your friend--'Clare'--Miss----?\"\n\n\"Hartill. Oh, no! Why should she?\"\n\n\"I should have thought--suicide--bad for the school's reputation?\"\n\n\"Then you think it was--that--too? It was supposed to be an accident.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, 'supposed'?\"\n\n\"There was an inquest, you see. I had to go. I was so frightened all the\ntime, of what I might slip into saying. But they all agreed that it was\nan accident. She was fond of curling up in the window-seats with her\nbooks. Oh, she was a queer little thing! When you came on her suddenly,\nshe used to look up like a startled baby colt. She always looked as if\nshe wanted some one to run to. Well, there was no guard, you see, only\nan inch of ledge--she had not been well--she must have felt faint--and\nfallen. They all said it was that. I was so thankful--for Clare's sake.\nShe could not reproach herself--after such a verdict. It was 'Accidental\nDeath.' Only--I--of course--I knew. Some of them guessed--Clare--and I\nbelieve Elsbeth, though we never discussed it--and I knew. But nobody\nsaid anything--nobody has, ever since, except once Clare told me--what\nshe feared. I never managed to persuade her that it was an accident, but\nat least she doesn't know for certain, and at least she knows she\ncouldn't help it. And now we never speak of it. But _I_ know----\"\n\n\"What do you know?\" he said. \"You found out something?\"\n\n\"She did--she did kill herself,\" said Alwynne. \"Oh, Roger, she did. I've\nknown it all along--I should have guessed anyway, I think, because I\nknew how unhappy she was. I knew how awfully she cared about Clare.\nClare was very good to her sometimes. Clare was fond of her, you know.\nClare takes violent fancies like that, to clever people. And Louise was\nbrilliant, of course. Clare was charmed with her. Only Louise--this is\nhow I've thought it out; oh, I've had time to think it out--she just got\ndrunk on it, the happiness, I mean, of being cared for. She hadn't much\nof a home. She was rather an ugly duckling to her people, I think. Then\nClare made a fuss of her, and you see, she was so little, she couldn't\nsee that--it didn't mean much to Clare. And I don't think grown-up\npeople understand how girls are--they have to worship some one, at that\nage. Clare doesn't quite understand, I think. She is too sensible\nherself to realise how girls can be silly. She is awfully good to them,\nbut, of course, she never dreams how miserable they get when she gets\nbored with them. She can't help it.\"\n\nRoger's face was expressive--but Alwynne was staring at the uneasy\nbutterfly.\n\n\"It doesn't matter, as a rule. Only Louise had no one else--and it just\nbroke her heart. If she had been grown-up it would have been like being\nin love.\"\n\nRoger made an inarticulate remark.\n\n\"Don't you see?\" said Alwynne innocently.\n\n\"I see.\" He was carefully expressionless.\n\n\"And then she was run down and did her work badly. And Clare hates\nillness--besides--she thought Louise was slacking. I tried to make her\nsee----Oh,\" she cried passionately, \"why didn't I try harder? It's\nhaunting me, Roger, that I didn't try hard enough. I ought to have\nknown how she felt--I was near her age. Clare couldn't be expected\nto--but Louise talked to me sometimes--I ought to have seen. I did see.\nAll that summer she went about so white and miserable--and Clare was\nangry with her--and I hadn't the pluck to tackle either of them. I was\nafraid of being a busybody--I was afraid of upsetting Clare. You\nsee--I'm awfully fond of Clare. She makes you forget everything but\nherself. And, of course, she never realised what was wrong with Louise.\nI didn't altogether, either--you do believe that?\" She broke off,\nquestioning pitifully, as if he were her judge.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Right till the day of the play, I never really saw how crazily\nmiserable she was growing. She was crazy--don't you think?\"\n\n\"You want to think so?\" He considered her curiously.\n\n\"It mitigates it.\"\n\n\"That she killed herself?\"\n\n\"It's deadly sin? Or don't you believe----?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"There's such a thing as the right of exit--but go on.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what I think presently. I want all your thoughts\nnow----There were signs----?\"\n\n\"Of insanity? No. But she was--exaggerated--too intelligent--too\nbabyish--too brilliant--too everything. She felt things too much. She\nfailed in an exam.--sheer overwork--just before.\"\n\n\"I see. Was she ambitious?\"\n\n\"Only to please Clare. Clare didn't like her failing.\"\n\n\"Did she tell the child so?\" His tone was stern.\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Clare would have told me if they had had a row. She tells me\neverything.\"\n\nHe smiled a little.\n\n\"How old is your friend?\"\n\nShe looked surprised.\n\n\"Oh--thirty-three--thirty-four--thirty-five. I don't really know. She\nnever talks about ages and looks and that sort of thing. She rather\ndespises all that. She laughs at me for--for liking clothes....\" Her\nlittle blush made her look natural again. \"But why?\"\n\n\"I wondered. Then there was nothing to upset the child?\"\n\n\"Only the failing. And then the play. I told you. She was awfully\nstrange afterwards. That's where I blame myself. I ought to have seen\nthat she was overwrought. But she drank the tea, and cheered up so when\nI told her Clare was pleased with her acting----\"\n\n\"Was she?\" He was frowning interestedly.\n\n\"I'm sure she must have been--it was brilliant, you know.\"\n\n\"She said so?\"\n\n\"Oh, not actually--but I could tell. And it cheered the child up. I was\nquite easy about her--and then ten minutes later----\" She shuddered.\n\n\"Then it might have been an accident,\" he suggested soothingly.\n\n\"It wasn't,\" she said, with despairing conviction.\n\n\"My dear girl! Either you're indulging in morbid imaginings--or you've\nsomething to go on?\"\n\nShe shook her head with a frightened look at him.\n\n\"No!\" she said hurriedly. \"No!\"\n\n\"Then why,\" he said quietly, meeting her eyes, \"were you frightened at\nthe inquest?\"\n\nShe averted her eyes.\n\n\"I wasn't--I mean--I was nervous, of course.\"\n\n\"You were frightened of what you might slip into saying. You told me so\nten minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you're trying to trap me?\" she flashed out wrathfully.\n\nHe rejoiced at the tone. It was the impetuous Alwynne of his daily\nintercourse again. The mere relief of discussion was, as he had\nguessed, having a tonic effect on her nerves.\n\nHe smiled at her pleasantly.\n\n\"Don't tell me anything more, if you'd rather not.\"\n\nShe subsided at this.\n\n\"I didn't mean to be angry,\" she faltered. \"Only I've guarded myself so\nfrom telling. You see, I lied at the inquest. It was perjury, I\nsuppose.\" There was a little touch of importance in her tone. \"But I'll\ntell you.\"\n\nShe hesitated, her older self once more supervening.\n\n\"Afterwards--when the doctor had come, and they took Louise away--after\nthat ghastly afternoon was over----\" She whitened. \"It was ghastly, you\nknow--so many people--crowding and gaping--I dream of all those crowded\nfaces----\"\n\n\"Well?\" he urged her forward.\n\n\"I went up to the room where she had changed, to see that the children\nhad gone----\"\n\n\"She fell from that room?\"\n\n\"She must have. After she had changed. She'd locked the door--to change.\nI broke it open. I thought she had fainted--a baby told me something\nabout Louise falling--lisping so, I couldn't make out what she\nmeant--and I'd run up to see. It turned out afterwards that little Joan\nhad been in a lower room, and had seen her body as it fell past the\nwindow.\"\n\n\"How beastly!\" he said, with an involuntary shudder.\n\n\"And when I got the door open--an empty room. Something made me look out\nof the window. She was down below--right under me--on the steps.\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"But afterwards?\" he urged her. \"You went up again?\"\n\n\"I had to. I was afraid already--recollecting little things. I looked\nabout, in case she'd left a message. And on the window-ledge--there were\ngreat scratches. Then I knew.\"\n\nShe was forgetting him, staring into space, peopled as it was with her\nmemories.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"Alwynne!\" he said urgently.\n\nShe looked at him absently.\n\n\"Scratches? What are you driving at?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said dully, \"there was a nail in her shoe. She had tried to\nhammer it in at the morning school. It had made scratches all over the\nrostrum. I was rather cross about it.\"\n\n\"But I don't see,\" he began, and stopped, realising suddenly her\nmeaning.\n\n\"You mean--she must have stood on the ledge--to make those marks?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alwynne. Then, fiercely, \"Well?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's conclusive,\" he admitted. He looked at her pityingly. \"You\npoor child! And you never told?\"\n\n\"I got a paint-box,\" she said defiantly, \"and painted them brown--like\nthe paintwork. It would have broken up Clare to know--and all the\nquestions and comments. What would you have done?\"\n\nHe ignored the challenge, answered only the misery in the tone.\n\n\"It can't have been easy for you--that week,\" he said gently.\n\n\"Easy?\" She began to laugh harshly. \"And yet I don't know,\" she\nreflected. \"I don't think I felt anything much at the time. It was like\nbeing in a play. Almost interesting. Entirely unreal. At the inquest--I\nlied as easily as saying grace. I wasn't a bit worried. What did worry\nme was a bit of sticking-plaster on the coroner's chin. One end was\nuncurled, and I was longing for him to stick it down again. It seemed\nmore important than anything else that he should stick it down. It would\nhave been a real relief to me. I'm not trying to be funny.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said.\n\n\"And when it was over--I was quite cheerful. And at the funeral--I know\nthey thought I was callous. But I didn't feel sad. Only cold--icy\ncold--in my hands and my feet and my heart. And I felt desperately\nirritated with them all for crying. People look appalling when they\ncry.\" She paused. \"So they banked up Louise with wreaths and we left\nher.\" She paused again.\n\n\"Well?\" he prompted.\n\n\"I went home at the end of that week. Elsbeth sent me to bed early. I\nwas log-tired all of a sudden. Oh, I was tired! I had hardly slept at\nall since she died. I'd stayed at Clare's, you know. She's a bad\nsleeper, too, and it always infects me--and we used to sit up till\ndaylight, forgetting the time, talking. We've always heaps to talk\nabout. Clare's a night-bird. She's always most brilliant about\nmidnight.\" She smiled reminiscently. \"We picnic, you know, in our\ndressing-gowns. She has a great white bearskin on the hearth. Her fires\nare piled up, and never go out all night. And I brew coffee--and we\ntalk. It's jolly. I wish you knew Clare. She's an absorbing person.\"\n\n\"You're giving me quite a good idea of her,\" he said. Then carelessly:\n\"But she must have realised that after such a shock--and the strain----\"\n\n\"Oh, it was much worse for Clare,\" she broke in quickly. \"Think--her\nspecial pupil! She had had such hopes of Louise. And Clare's so terribly\nsensitive--she was getting it on her mind. Do you know, she almost began\nto think it was her fault, not to have seen what was going on? Once, she\nwas absolutely frantic with depression, poor darling, until I made her\nunderstand that, if it was any one's, it must be mine. Of course, when I\ntold her everything, how I'd guessed Louise was pretty miserable, and\ntried to tell her again and then funked it--well, then she saw. As she\nsaid, if I'd only spoken out.... She was very kind--but, of course, I\nsoon felt that she thought I was responsible--indirectly--for the whole\nthing----\" Her voice quavered.\n\nRoger, watching her simple face, wanted to do something vigorous. At\nthat moment it would have given him great satisfaction to have\ninterviewed Miss Hartill. Failing that, he wanted to take Alwynne by the\nshoulders and shake the nonsense out of her. He repressed himself,\nhowever. He was in his way, as simple as Alwynne, but where she was\nmerely direct, he was shrewd. He knew that she must show him all the\nweeds that were choking her before he could set about uprooting them and\nplanting good seed in their stead.\n\nShe went on.\n\n\"But even then, though I had been neglectful--oh, Roger, what made\nLouise do it? Just then? She looked happier! It couldn't have been\nanything I'd said! I know I cheered her up. It's inconceivable! She was\nsmiling, contented--and she went straight upstairs and killed herself!\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Inconceivable, as you say. You're sure--of your facts!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I mean--you were the last person to see her?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Roger! every one was at tea.\"\n\n\"Miss Hartill?\"\n\n\"Clare would have said----\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"she tells you everything.\"\n\nShe nodded, in all good faith--\n\n\"Besides, Clare was in the mistresses' room.\"\n\n\"Impossible for her to have spoken with Louise?\"\n\n\"Quite. Clare would have told me----\"\n\n\"Yet there remains the fact that Louise was, as you say, happier after\nseeing you. Within fifteen minutes, she is dead. Either she went\nmad--which I don't believe, do you?\"\n\n\"I want to----\"\n\n\"But you don't--knowing the child. Neither do I, from what you tell me.\nShe seems to have been horribly sane. Sane enough, anyhow, to throw off\na burden. So if, as we agree, she didn't suddenly go mad--something\noccurred to change her mood of comparative happiness to actual despair.\nI think, if you ask me, that she did see Miss Hartill after she left\nyou.\"\n\n\"But Clare would have told me,\" repeated Alwynne stubbornly.\n\n\"I'm not so sure.\"\n\n\"But she said nothing at the inquest, either.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" he retorted. \"If she had had a row with the child it would\nhave sounded pretty bad.\"\n\n\"But Clare's incapable of deceit.\"\n\n\"She might say the same of you.\"\n\n\"But--if your guess were true, it would be Clare's fault--all Clare's\nfault--not mine at all!\" she deducted slowly.\n\n\"It's not your fault, anyway,\" he assured her.\n\n\"But it would have been too utterly cruel of Clare not to have told me.\nShe knew what I felt at the time--why not have told me?\"\n\n\"She might have been afraid--you might have shrunk----\"\n\n\"From Clare?\" She smiled securely. Then, with a change of tone: \"No,\nRoger. All this is guessing, far-fetched guessing.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, Alwynne,\" he said sharply, \"there was gross cruelty in her\ntreatment of that child. You can't excuse it. Directly or indirectly,\nshe is responsible for her death.\"\n\nShe flushed.\n\n\"You have not the shadow of right to say that.\"\n\n\"I do say it.\"\n\nShe put out her hand to him with a touch of appeal.\n\n\"Please--won't you leave Clare out of it? You are utterly wrong. You\nsee, you don't know her. If you did you would understand. I am so\ngrateful to you for being kind. I don't want to be angry. But I must, if\nyou talk like that. Please--if you can, make me sure it wasn't my fault.\nBut if it involves Clare--I'd rather go on being--not not quite happy.\nYet I hoped, perhaps, you would help me.\"\n\n\"Of course I'm helping you,\" he said, quick to catch and adopt her tone.\nHe had no wish to intimidate her. He liked her pathetic little dignities\nand loyalties. He was, so far, content; he had, he knew, in spite of her\nprotestations, sown a seed of distrust in her mind. Time would ripen it.\nHe felt no compunction in enlightening her blind devotion. He had quick\nantipathies, and he had conceived an idea of Clare Hartill that would\nhave appalled Alwynne, and which justified to himself any measure that\nhe might see fit to take. In his own mind he referred to her as \"that\npoisonous female.\" There were no half-measures with Roger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nAlwynne leant back in her chair and regarded Roger with some intentness.\n\n\"Well?\" he said politely.\n\n\"I was thinking----\" she said lamely.\n\n\"Obviously.\"\n\n\"That it was rather queer--that I should tell you all this, when I\ncouldn't even tell Elsbeth.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's often easier to talk to strangers? One's\npersonality can make its own impression--it has no preconception to\nfight against.\"\n\n\"Yes. But I hate strangers, till they've stopped being strange. And, you\nknow\"--she hesitated--\"I haven't really liked you. Have you noticed it?\"\n\n\"In streaks,\" he admitted. \"But why?\"\n\n\"You patronise so!\" she flared. \"You make me feel a fool. This\nafternoon----Of course, it's quite true that I don't know much about\nmen. I suppose you knew I was--inexperienced; but you needn't have\nrubbed it in. And you've always talked down to me.\"\n\n\"I don't think I did,\" he considered the matter unsmiling. \"I think it's\nrather the other way--the tilt of your nose disturbs my complacence. You\nlisten to me at meals like Disapproval incarnate. You make me nervous.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" she asked delightedly.\n\n\"Yes.\" He laughed. \"I hide it under a superior air, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" she sympathised. \"That's what I do always.\"\n\n\"It is useful,\" he agreed.\n\n\"People may think you disagreeable, but at least you're dignified. _You\nhave chosen your fault well, I really cannot laugh at it._ Do you\nremember? I told Elsbeth that you were like Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\"And that you don't like me?\"\n\n\"Well--I didn't. That's why it's so queer--that I can talk to you so\neasily. I am grateful. It has helped, just talking.\"\n\n\"I knew it would.\"\n\n\"I feel better.\" She stirred in her seat. \"Is it late? Ought we to be\ngoing home?\"\n\nHe chose his words, his eyes on her, though he spoke casually enough.\n\n\"No hurry. We can always take a cut through the wood, you know.\"\n\nShe flinched at that, as he expected; spoke uneasily, furtive-eyed.\n\n\"I think I'd rather go at once--round by the road. Isn't there a road?\"\nShe rose and looked about her, taking farewell of the daffodils.\n\n\"Yes, there's a road. Wouldn't you like a bunch?\" He took a pair of\nscissors from the wall, and began to select his blooms. Alwynne followed\nhim delightedly. She thought she would have a surprise for Clare, after\nall. And Elsbeth! Elsbeth was an after-thought. But she hoped there\nwould be enough for Elsbeth.\n\n\"Why won't you go back through the wood?\" he said quietly, as, hands\nfull, he at last replaced the scissors on their particular nail, and\ntwitched a strand from the horse-tail of bass that hung beside them.\n\"Tell me.\" Then, calmly, \"Here--put your finger here, will you?\"\n\nMechanically she obeyed and he tied the knot that secured the great\nyellow sheaf and gave it to her.\n\n\"Now tell me. What frightened you in the wood? What was wrong?\" He spoke\nquietly, but his tone compelled her.\n\n\"If you dreamed a dream----\" she began unwillingly, \"night after\nnight--month after month--something ghastly----\"\n\n\"Yes--\" he encouraged her.\n\n\"Ah, well--at least you've the comfort of knowing it's a dream. But\nsuppose, one day--you dreamt it while you were awake----?\"\n\n\"Dreamt what?\" He guessed her meaning, but he was deliberately forcing\nher to reduce her terrors into words--the more they crystallised, the\neasier she would find it to face and destroy them.\n\n\"Do you believe in hell?\" she flung at him.\n\n\"I should jolly well think so.\"\n\n\"For children?\" Her tone implored comfort.\n\n\"I'm afraid so.\"\n\n\"But how can it be fair? They're so little. They don't know right from\nwrong.\"\n\n\"I knew a kid,\" he said meditatively, an eye on her tormented face,\n\"only eight--used to act, if you please. Hung about London stage-doors,\nand bearded managers in their dens for a living. Quick little chap!\nFather drunk or ill; incapable, anyhow. The child supported them both.\nI've seen that child kept hanging about three or four hours on end. And\nwhat he knew! It made you sick and sorry. He must be twelve by\nnow--getting on, I believe, poor kid! And a cheerful monkey! He's\ncertainly had his hell, though.\"\n\nShe had hardly listened, she was absorbed in her thoughts; but she\ncaught at his last words----\n\n\"In this life? Oh, yes! That's cruel enough. But not afterwards? Not\neternal damnation! I don't mind it for myself so much--but for a baby\nthat can't understand why----It isn't possible, is it?\"\n\nHe began to laugh jollily.\n\n\"Alwynne--you utter fool! Don't you believe in God?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Of course, if you didn't----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she thrust in. \"Then it would be all right. I could be sure she\nwas asleep--dead--like last year's leaves----\"\n\n\"But why should God complicate matters?\"\n\n\"Well--heaven follows--and hell--don't they? _Their worm dieth not_--and\nall the rest.\"\n\n\"Oh, I follow.\"\n\n\"Miss Marsham--the head mistress, you know--of course she's very\nold--but she believes--terribly. It's an awfully religious school. It\nscares some of the children. I used to laugh, but now, since Louise\ndied, it scares me, though I am grown up. I've no convictions--and she\nis certain--and then I get these nightmares. I hear her calling--for\nwater.\"\n\nThe flat matter-of-fact tone alarmed him more than emotion would have\ndone.\n\n\"Water?\"\n\n\"_For I am tormented in this flame._ I hear her every night--wailing.\"\nHer eyes strained after something that he could not see.\n\nHe found no words.\n\nShe returned with an effort.\n\n\"Of course, when it's over--I know it's imagination. My sense tells me\nso--in the daytime. Only I can't be sure. If only I could be sure! If\nsome one would tell me to be sure. It's the reasoning it out for\nmyself--all day--and going back to the dreams all night.\"\n\n\"How long has this been going on?\" he asked curtly.\n\n\"Ever since--when I came home from Clare's--that night. I'd slept like a\nlog. Then I woke up suddenly. I thought I heard Louise calling. I'd\nforgotten she was dead. Every night it happens--as soon as I go to\nsleep, she comes. Always trying to speak to me. I hear her screaming\nwith pain--wanting help. Never any words. Do you think I'm mad? I know\nit's only a dream--but every night, you know----\"\n\n\"You're not going to dream any more,\" he said, with a determination that\nbelied his inward sense of dismay. \"But go on--let's have the rest of\nit.\"\n\n\"There isn't much. Just dreams. It's been a miserable year. I couldn't\nbe cheerful always, you know--and I used to dread going to bed so. It\nmade me stupid all day. And Clare--Clare didn't quite understand. Oh--I\ndid want to tell her so. But you can't worry people. I'm afraid Elsbeth\ngot worried--she hates it if you don't eat and have a colour. She packed\nme off here at last.\"\n\nShe drew a long breath.\n\n\"This blessed place! You don't know how I love it. I feel a different\ngirl. All this space and air and freedom. What is it that the country\ndoes to one's mind? I've slept. No dreaming. Sleep that's like a hot\nbath. Can you imagine what that is after these months? Oh, Roger! I\nthought I'd stopped dreaming for good--I was forgetting----\"\n\n\"Go on forgetting,\" he said. \"You can. I'll help you. You had a shock.\nIt made you ill. You're getting well again. That's all.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" she said. \"I'm going mad. To-day, in that wood.... Louise\ncame running after me--and I was awake....\"\n\nSuddenly she gave a little ripple of high-pitched laughter.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Lumsden! Isn't this a ridiculous conversation? And your\nface--you're so absurd when you frown.... You make me laugh.... You make\nme laugh....\"\n\nShe broke off. Roger, with a swift movement, had turned and was standing\nover her.\n\n\"Now shut up!\" he said sharply. \"Shut up! D'you hear? Shut up this\ninstant, and sit down.\" He put his hand on her shoulder and jerked her\nback into the chair.\n\nThe shock of his roughness checked her hysterics, as he had intended it\nshould. She sat limply, her head in her hand, trying not to cry. He\nwatched her.\n\n\"Pull yourself together, Alwynne,\" he said more gently.\n\nHer lips quivered, but she nodded valiantly.\n\n\"I will. Just wait a minute. I don't want to make a fool of myself.\"\nThen, with a quavering laugh, \"Oh, Roger, this is pleasant for you!\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"You needn't mind me,\" he said calmly. \"Any more than I mind you. Except\nwhen you threaten hysterics. I bar hysterics. I wouldn't mind if they\ndid any good. But we've got lots to do. No time at all for them. We've\ngot to work this thing out. Ready?\"\n\nAlwynne waited, her attention caught.\n\n\"Now listen,\" he said. \"First of all, get it into your head that I know\nall about it, and that I'm going to see you through. Next--whenever you\nget scared--though you won't again, I hope--that you are just to come\nand talk it over. You won't even have to tell me--I shall see by your\nface, you know. Do you understand? You're not alone any more. I'm here.\nAlways ready to lay your ghosts for you. Will you remember?\"\n\nHe spoke clearly and patiently--very cheerful and reassuring.\n\n\"You've got to go home well, Alwynne. Because, you know, though you're\nas sane as I am, you've been ill. This last year has been one long\nillness. You had a shock--a ghastly shock--and, of course, it skinned\nyour nerves raw. My dear, I wonder it didn't send you really mad,\ninstead of merely making you afraid of going mad. If you hadn't put up\nsuch a fight----Honestly, Alwynne! I think you've been jolly plucky.\"\n\nThe sincere admiration in his voice was wonderfully pleasant to hear.\n\nAlwynne opened her eyes widely.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" she began shyly.\n\n\"I'm not imaginative,\" he said, \"but if I'd been hag-ridden as you\nhave----\" He broke off abruptly. \"But, at least, you've fought yourself\nfree,\" he continued cheerfully. \"Yes, in spite of to-day.\" And his\ncomplete assurance of voice and manner had its effect on Alwynne,\nthough she did not realise it.\n\n\"You're better already. You say yourself you're a different girl since\nyou got away from--since you came here. And when you're quite well,\nit'll be your own work, not mine. I'm just tugging you up the bank, so\nto speak. But you've done the real fighting with the elements. I think\nyou can be jolly proud of yourself.\"\n\nAlwynne looked at him, half smiling, half bewildered.\n\n\"What do you mean? You talk as if it were all over. Shall I never be\nfrightened again? Think of to-day?\"\n\n\"Of course it's all over,\" he assured her truculently. \"To-day? To-day\nwas the last revolt of your imagination. You've let it run riot too\nlong. Of course it hasn't been easy to call it to heel.\"\n\n\"You think it's all silly imaginings, then?\"\n\n\"Alwynne,\" he said. \"You've got to listen to this, just this. You\nsay I'm not to talk about your friend, that I don't know her--that\nI'm unjust. But listen, at least, to this. I won't be unfair. I'll\ngrant you that she was fond of the little girl, and meant no harm,\nno more than you did. But you say yourself that she was miserable\ntill you relieved her mind by taking all the blame on yourself. Can't\nyou conceive that in so doing you did assume a burden, a very real\none? Don't you think that her fears, her terrors, may have haunted you\nas well as your own? I believe in the powers of thought. I believe\nthat fear--remorse--regret--may materialise into a very ghost at your\nelbow. Do you remember Macbeth and Banquo? Do you believe that a something\nreally physical sat that night in the king's seat? Do you think it was\nthe man from his grave? I think it was Macbeth's thoughts incarnate. He\nthought too much, that man. But let's leave all that. Let's argue it out\nfrom a common-sense point of view. You said you believed in God?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"And the devil?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Well--I'm not so sure that I do,\" he remarked meditatively. \"But if I\ndo--I must say I cannot see the point of a God who wouldn't be more than\na match for him: and a God who'd leave a baby in his clutches to expiate\nin fire and brimstone and all the rest of the beastliness----Well, is\nit common sense?\" he appealed to her.\n\n\"If you put it like that----\" she admitted.\n\n\"My dear, would you let Louise frizzle if it were in your hands? Why,\nyou've driven yourself half crazy with fear for her, as it is. Can't you\ngive God credit for a little common humanity? I'm not much of a Bible\nreader, but I seem to remember something about a sparrow falling to the\nground----Now follow it up,\" he went on urgently. \"If Louise's life was\nso little worth living that she threw it away--doesn't it prove she had\nher hell down here? If you insist on a hell. And when she was dead, poor\nbaby, can't you trust God to have taken charge of her? And if He has--as\nHe must have--do you think that child--that happy child, Alwynne, for if\nGod exists at all, He must exist as the very source and essence of peace\nand love--that that child would or could wrench itself apart from God,\nfrom its happiness, in order to return to torment you? Is it possible?\nIs it probable? In any way feasible?\"\n\nAlwynne caught her breath.\n\n\"How you believe in God! I wish I could!\"\n\nRoger flushed suddenly like an embarrassed boy.\n\n\"You know, it's queer,\" he confided, subsiding na\u00c3\u00afvely, \"till I began to\ntalk to you, I didn't know I did. I never bother about church and\nthings. You know----\"\n\nBut Alwynne was not attending.\n\n\"Of course--I see what you mean,\" she murmured. \"It applies to Louise\ntoo. Why, Roger, she was really fond of me--not as she was of Clare--of\ncourse--but quite fond of me. She never would have hurt me. Hurt? Poor\nmite! She never hurt any one in all her life.\"\n\n\"I wonder you didn't think of that before,\" remarked Roger severely. \"I\nhope you see what an idiot you've been?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alwynne meekly. She did not flash out at him as he had hoped\nshe would: but her manner had grown calm, and her eyes were peaceful.\n\n\"Poor little Louise!\" said Alwynne slowly. \"So we needn't think about\nher any more? She's to be dead, and buried, and forgotten. It sounds\nharsh, doesn't it? But she is dead--and I've only been keeping her alive\nin my mind all this year. Is that what you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"And if it were not as I think it is, sheer\nimagination--if your grieving and fear really kept a fraction of her\npersonality with you, to torment you both--let her go now, Alwynne. Say\ngood-bye to her kindly, and let her go home.\"\n\nShe looked at him gravely for a moment. Then she turned from him to the\nempty house of flowers.\n\n\"Good-bye, Louise!\" said Alwynne, simply as a child.\n\nAbout them was the evening silence. The sun, sinking over the edge of\nthe world, was a blinding glory.\n\nOut of the flowers rose the butterfly, found an open pane and fluttered\nout on the evening air, straight into the heart of the sunlight.\n\nThey watched it with dazzled eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nAlwynne had gone to bed early. She confessed to being tired, as she bade\nher cousins good-night, and, indeed, she had dark rings about her eyes;\nbut her colour was brilliant as she waited at the foot of the stairs for\nher candle. Roger had followed her into the hall and was lighting it.\nThe thin flame flickered between them, kindling odd lights in their\neyes.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Alwynne, and went up a shallow step or two.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Roger, without moving.\n\nShe turned suddenly and bent down to him over the poppy-head of the\nbalustrade.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Alwynne once more, and put out her hand.\n\n\"You're to sleep well, you know,\" he said authoritatively.\n\nShe nodded. Then, with a rush--\n\n\"Roger, I do thank you. I do thank you very much.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Roger awkwardly.\n\nAlwynne went upstairs.\n\nHe watched her disappear in the shadows of the landing, and took a\nmeditative turn up and down the long hall before he returned to the\ndrawing-room.\n\nHe felt oddly responsible for the girl; wished that he had some one to\nconsult about her.... His aunts? Dears, of course, but ... Alicia,\npossibly.... Certainly not Jean.... Nothing against them ... dearest\nwomen alive ... but hardly capable of understanding Alwynne, were they?\nWithout at all realising it he had already arrived at the conviction\nthat no one understood Alwynne but himself.\n\nHe caught her name as he re-entered the room.\n\n\"Ever so much better! A different creature! Don't you think so, Roger?\"\n\n\"Think what?\"\n\n\"That Alwynne's a new girl? It's the air. Nothing like Dene air. But, of\ncourse, you didn't see her when she first came. A poor white thing!\nShe'd worked herself to a shadow. How Elsbeth allowed it----\"\n\nJean caught her up.\n\n\"Overwork! Fiddlesticks! It wasn't that. I'm convinced in my own mind\nthat there's something behind it. A girl doesn't go to pieces like that\nfrom a little extra work. Look at your Compton women at the end of a\nterm. Bursting with energy still, I will say that for them. No--I'm\ninclined to agree with Parker. I told you what she said to me? 'She must\nhave been crossed in love, poor young lady, the way she fiddle-faddles\nwith her food!'\"\n\nAlicia laughed.\n\n\"When you and Parker get together there's not a reputation safe in the\nthree Denes. If there had been anything of the kind, Elsbeth would have\ngiven me a hint.\"\n\n\"I should have thought Elsbeth would be the last person----\" Jean broke\noff significantly.\n\nRoger glanced at her, eyebrows lifted.\n\n\"What's she driving at, Aunt Alice?\"\n\n\"Lord knows!\" said Alicia shortly.\n\nJean grew huffed.\n\n\"It's all very well, Alicia, to take that tone. You know what I mean\nperfectly well. Considering how reticent Elsbeth was over her own\naffairs to us--she wouldn't be likely to confide anything about Alwynne.\nBut Elsbeth always imagined no one had any eyes.\"\n\nAlicia moved uneasily in her chair.\n\n\"Jean, will you never let that foolish gossip be? It wasn't your\nbusiness thirty years ago--at least let it alone now.\"\n\nJean flushed.\n\n\"It's all very well to be superior, Alicia, but you know you agreed with\nme at the time.\"\n\nRoger chuckled.\n\n\"What are you two driving at? Let's have it.\"\n\nAlicia answered him.\n\n\"My dear boy, you know what Jean is. Elsbeth stayed with us a good deal\nwhen we were all girls together--and because she and your dear father\nwere very good friends----\"\n\n\"Inseparable!\" snapped Jean. She was annoyed that the telling of the\nstory was taken from her.\n\n\"Oh, they had tastes in common. But we all liked him. I'm quite certain\nElsbeth was perfectly heart-whole. Only Jean has the servant-girl habit\nof pairing off all her friends and acquaintances. I don't say, of\ncourse, that if John had never met your dear mother--but she came home\nfrom her French school--she'd been away two years, you know--and turned\neverybody's head. Ravishing she was. I remember her coming-out dance.\nShe wore the first short dress we'd seen--every one wore trains in those\ndays--white gauze and forget-me-nots. She looked like a fairy. All the\ngentlemen wanted to dance with her, she was so light-footed. Your father\nfell head over ears! They were engaged in a fortnight. And nobody, in\nher quiet way, was more pleased than Elsbeth, I'm sure. Why, she was one\nof the bridesmaids!\"\n\n\"She never came to stay with them afterwards,\" said Jean obstinately,\n\"always had an excuse.\"\n\n\"Considering she had to nurse her father, with her mother an invalid\nalready----\" Alicia was indignant. \"Ten years of sick-nursing that poor\ngirl had!\"\n\n\"Anyhow, she never came to Dene again till after John died. Then she\ncame, once. When she heard we were all going out to Italy. Stayed a\nweek.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Roger unexpectedly.\n\n\"You! You were only five,\" cried Jean. The clock struck as she spoke.\nShe jumped up. \"Alicia! It's ten o'clock! Where's Parker? Why hasn't\nParker brought the biscuits? You really might speak to her! She's always\nlate!\"\n\nShe flurried out of the room.\n\nRoger drew in his chair.\n\n\"Aunt Alice, I say--how much of that is just--Aunt Jean?\"\n\nAlicia sighed.\n\n\"My dear boy! How should I know? It's all such a long while ago. Jean's\nno respecter of privacy. I never noticed anything--hate prying--always\ndid.\"\n\n\"She never married?\"\n\n\"She was over thirty before her mother died. She aged quickly--faded\nsomehow. At that visit Jean spoke of--I shall never forget the change in\nher. She was only twenty-six, two years older than your mother, but\nRosemary was a girl beside her, in spite of you and her widow's weeds.\nAnd then Alwynne was left on her hands and she absorbed herself in her.\nShe's one of those self-effacing women--But there--she's quite\ncontented, I think. She adores Alwynne. Her letters are cheerful enough.\nI always kept up with her. I'd like to see her again.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you ask her with Alwynne?\"\n\n\"I did. She wouldn't come. Spring-cleaning, and one of her whimsies.\nWanted the child to have a change from her. That's Elsbeth all over. She\nwas always painfully humble. I imagine she'd sell her immortal soul for\nAlwynne.\"\n\n\"Well--and so would you for me,\" said Roger, with a twinkle.\n\n\"Don't you flatter yourself,\" retorted Alicia with spirit. Then she\nlaughed and kissed him, and lumbered off to scold Jean up to bed.\n\nRoger sat late, staring into the fire, and reviewing the day's\nhappenings.\n\nThere was Alwynne to be considered.... Alwynne in the wood.... Alwynne\nin the daffodil house.... Alwynne hanging over the bannisters, a candle\nin her hand.... And Elsbeth.... Elsbeth had become something more than a\nname.... Elsbeth had known his mother--had been \"pals\" with his\nfather.... He chuckled at the recollection of Jean's speculations....\nPoor old Jean! She hadn't altered much.... He remembered her first\nhorror at Compton and its boys and girls.... But Elsbeth was evidently a\ngood sort ... appreciated Alwynne.... He would like to have a talk with\nElsbeth.... He would like to have her version of that disastrous summer;\nhave her views on Alwynne and this school of hers ... and that woman ...\nwhat was her name?... Hartill! Clare Hartill! Yes, he must certainly get\nto know Alwynne's Elsbeth.... In the meantime....\n\nHe hesitated, fidgeting at his desk; spoiled a sheet or two; shrugged\nhis shoulders; began again; and finally, with a laugh at his own\nuncertainty, settled down to the writing of a long letter to his second\ncousin Elsbeth.\n\nElsbeth, opening a boot-boxful of daffodils on the following evening,\nhad no leisure for any other letter till Alwynne's was read.\n\n     _I hope they'll arrive fresh. Roger packed them for me himself.\n     He's frightfully clever with flowers, you know; you should just see\n     his greenhouses! But he goes in chiefly for roses; he's going to\n     teach me pruning and all that, he says, later on. The Dears were\n     out all day, but he looked after me. He's really awfully nice when\n     you get to know him. One of those sensible people. I'm sure you\n     would like him_, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nElsbeth smiled over her daffodils. She had to put them in water, and\narrange them, and re-arrange them, and admire them for a full half-hour\nbefore she had time for the rest of her post, for her two circulars and\nthe letter in the unfamiliar handwriting.\n\nBut when, at last, it was opened, she had no more eyes for daffodils;\nand though she spent her evening letter-writing, Alwynne got no thanks\nfor them next day.\n\n\"Not even a note!\" declaimed Alwynne indignantly. \"She might at least\nhave sent me a note! It isn't as if she had any one else to write to!\"\n\nRoger was most sympathetic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nAlwynne's visit had been prolonged in turn by Alicia, Jean and Roger;\nand Elsbeth had acquiesced--her sedate letters never betrayed how\neagerly--in each delay.\n\nAlicia was flatteringly in need of her help for the Easter church\ndecorations, and how could Alwynne refuse? Jean was in the thick of\npreparations for the bazaar: Alwynne's quick wits and clever fingers\nwere not to be dispensed with. Alwynne wondered what Clare would say to\nher interest in a bazaar and a mothers' meeting, and was a little\nnervous that it would be considered anything but a reasonable excuse for\nyet another delay. Clare's letters were getting impatient--Clare was\nwanting her back. Clare was finding her holidays dull. Yet Alwynne,\nlonging to return to her, was persuaded to linger--for a bazaar--a\nvillage bazaar! That a bazaar of all things should tempt Alwynne from\nClare! She felt the absurdity of it as fully as ever Clare could do. Yet\nshe stayed. After all, The Dears had been very good to her.... She\nshould be glad to make some small return by being useful when she\ncould....\n\nAnd Alwynne was pleasantly conscious that she was uncommonly useful. A\nfair is a many-sided gaiety. There are tableaux--Alwynne's suggestions\nwere invaluable. Side-shows--Alwynne, in a witch's hat, told the\nentire village its fortunes with precision and point. Alwynne's\nwell-drilled school-babies were pretty enough in their country\ndances and nursery rhymes; and the stall draperies were a credit\nto Alwynne's taste. Alwynne's posters lined the walls; and her lightning\nportraits--fourpence each, married couples sixpence--were the success\nof the evening. The village notabilities were congratulatory: The Dears\nbeamed: it was all very pleasant.\n\nHer pleasure in her own popularity was innocent enough. Nevertheless she\nglanced uneasily in the direction of Roger Lumsden more than once during\nthe evening. He was very big and busy in his corner helping his aunts,\nbut she felt herself under observation. She had an odd idea that he was\namused at her. She thought he might have enquired if she needed help\nduring the long evening, when the little Parish Hall was grown crowded.\nOnce, indeed, she signed to him across the room to come and talk to her,\nbut he laughed and shook his head, and turned again to an old mother,\nabsorbed in a pile of flannel petticoats. Alwynne was not pleased.\n\nBut when the sale had come to its triumphant end, and the stall-holders\nstood about in little groups, counting coppers and comparing gains--it\nwas Roger who discovered Alwynne, laughing a trifle mechanically at the\njokes of the ancient rector, and came to her rescue.\n\nShe found herself in the cool outer air, hat and scarf miraculously in\nplace.\n\n\"Jean and Alicia are driving, they won't be long after us. I thought\nyou'd rather walk. That room was a furnace,\" said Roger, with\nsolicitude.\n\nShe drew a deep breath.\n\n\"It was worth it to get this. Isn't it cool and quiet? I like this black\nand white road. Doesn't the night smell delicious?\"\n\n\"It's the cottage gardens,\" he said.\n\n\"Wallflowers and briar and old man. Better than all your acres of glass,\nafter all,\" she insinuated mischievously. Then, with a change of tone,\n\"Oh, dear, I am tired.\"\n\n\"You'd better hang on to my arm,\" said Roger promptly. \"That's better.\nOf course you're tired. If you insist on running the entire show----\"\n\n\"Then you did think that?\" Alwynne gave instant battle. \"I knew you\ndid. I saw you laugh. I can walk by myself, thank you.\"\n\nBut her dignity edged her into a cart-rut, for Roger did not deviate\nfrom the middle of the lane.\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"You're a consistent young woman--I'm as sure of a rise----You'd better\ntake my arm. Alwynne! You're not to say 'Damn.'\" A puddle shone blackly,\nand Alwynne, nose in air, had stepped squarely into it.\n\nShe ignored his comments.\n\n\"I wasn't interfering. I had to help where I could. They asked me to.\nBesides--I liked it.\"\n\n\"Of course you did.\"\n\nShe looked up quickly.\n\n\"Did I really do anything wrong? Did I push myself forward?\"\n\n\"You made the whole thing go,\" he said seriously. \"A triumph, Alwynne.\nThe rector's your friend for life.\"\n\n\"Then why do you grudge it?\" She was hurt.\n\n\"Do I?\"\n\n\"You laugh at me.\"\n\n\"Because I was pleased.\"\n\n\"With me?\"\n\n\"With my thoughts. You've enjoyed yourself, haven't you?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I never dreamed it would be such fun.\" She laughed shyly. \"I like\npeople to like me.\"\n\n\"Now, come,\" he said. \"Wasn't it quite as amusing as a prize-giving?\"\n\nShe looked up at him, puzzled. He was switching with his stick at the\nparsley-blooms, white against the shadows of the hedge.\n\n\"I suppose your goal is a head mistress-ship?\" he suggested\noff-handedly.\n\n\"Why?\" began Alwynne, wondering. Then, taking the bait: \"Not for\nmyself--I couldn't. I haven't been to college, you know. But if Clare\ngot one--I could be her secretary, and run things for her, like Miss\nVigers did for Miss Marsham. We've often planned it.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's a prospect indeed,\" he remarked. \"I suppose it would be more\nattractive, for instance, than to be Lady Bountiful to a village?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Alwynne, with conviction. \"More scope, you know. And,\nbesides, Clare hates the country.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Roger.\n\nThey walked awhile in silence.\n\nBut before they reached home, Roger had grown talkative again. He had\nheard from his aunts that she was planning to go back to Utterbridge on\nthe following Saturday--a bare three days ahead. Roger thought that a\npity. The bazaar was barely over--had Alwynne any idea of the clearing\nup there would be to do? Accounts--calls--congratulations. Surely\nAlwynne would not desert his aunts till peace reigned once more. And the\nfirst of his roses would be out in another week; Alwynne ought to see\nthem; they were a sight. Surely Alwynne could spare another week.\n\nAlwynne had a lot to say about Elsbeth. And Clare. Especially Clare.\nAlwynne did not think it would be kind to either of them to stay away\nany longer. It would look at last as if she didn't want to go home.\nElsbeth would be hurt. And Clare. Especially Clare.\n\nBut the lane had been dark and the hedges had been high, high enough to\nshut out all the world save Roger and his plausibilities. By the time\nthey reached the garden gate Alwynne's hand was on Roger's arm--Alwynne\nwas tired--and Alwynne had promised to stay yet another week at Dene. On\nthe following day, labouring over her letters of explanation, she\nwondered what had possessed her. Wondered, between a chuckle of mischief\nand a genuine shiver, what on earth Clare would say.\n\nBut if Roger had gained his point, he gained little beside it. The week\npassed pleasantly, but some obscure instinct tied Alwynne to his aunts'\napron-strings. He saw less of her in those last days than in all the\nweeks of her visit. He had assured her that The Dears would need help,\nand she took him at his word. She absorbed herself in their concerns,\nand in seven long days found time but twice to visit Roger's roses.\n\nYet who so pleasant as Alwynne when she was with him? Roger should have\nappreciated her whim of civility. It is on record that she agreed with\nhim one dinner-time, on five consecutive subjects. On record, too, that\nin that last week there arose between them no quarrel worthy of the\nname. Yet Roger was not in the easiest of moods, as his gardeners knew,\nand his coachman, and his aunts. The gardeners grumbled. The coachman\nwent so far as to think of talking of giving notice. Alicia said it was\nthe spring. Jean thought he needed a tonic--or a change. Roger,\ncautiously consulted, surprised her by agreeing. He said it was a good\nidea. He might very well take a few days off, say in a fortnight, or\nthree weeks....\n\nOnly Alwynne, very busy over the finishing touches of Clare's birthday\npresent, paid no attention to the state of Roger's temper. She was\nentirely content. The anticipation of her reunion with Clare accentuated\nthe delights of her protracted absence. Indeed, it was not until the\nlast morning of her visit that she noticed any change in him. That last\nmorning, she thought resentfully, as later she considered matters in the\ntrain, he had certainly managed to spoil. Roger, her even-minded,\ntranquil Roger--Roger, prime sympathiser and confederate--Roger, the\nentirely dependable--had failed her. She did not know what had come over\nhim.\n\nFor Roger had been in a bad temper, a rotten bad temper, and heaven knew\nwhy.... Alwynne didn't.... She had been in such a jolly frame of mind\nherself.... She had got her packing done early, and had dashed down to\nbreakfast, beautifully punctual--and then it all began.... She re-lived\nit indignantly, as the telegraph poles shot by.\n\nThe bacon had sizzled pleasantly in the chafing-dish. She was standing\nat the window, crumbling bread to the birds.\n\n\"Hulloa! You're early!\" remarked Roger, entering.\n\n\"Done all my packing already! Isn't that virtue?\" Alwynne was intent on\nher pensioners. \"Oh, Roger--look! There's a cuckoo. I'm sure it's a\ncuckoo. Jean says they come right on to the lawn sometimes. I've always\nwanted to see one. Look! The big dark blue one.\"\n\n\"Starling,\" said Roger shortly, and sat himself down. \"First day I've\nknown you punctual,\" he continued sourly.\n\n\"I'm going home,\" cried Alwynne. \"I'm going home! Do you know I've been\naway seven weeks? It's queer that I haven't been homesick, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Is it?\" said Roger blankly.\n\n\"So, of course, I'm awfully excited,\" she continued, coming to the\ntable. \"Oh, Roger! In six hours I shall see Clare!\"\n\n\"Congratulations!\" He gulped down some coffee.\n\nAlwynne looked at him, mildly surprised at his taciturnity.\n\n\"I've had a lovely time,\" she remarked wistfully. \"You've all been so\ngood to me.\"\n\nRoger brightened.\n\n\"The Dears are such dears,\" continued Alwynne with enthusiasm. \"I've\nnever had such a glorious time. It only wanted Clare to make it quite\nperfect. And Elsbeth, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Roger.\n\n\"So often I've thought,\" she went on: \"'Now if only Clare and Elsbeth\ncould be coming down the road to meet us----'\" she paused effectively.\n\"I do so like my friends to know each other, don't you?\"\n\nRoger was cutting bread--stale bread, to judge by his efforts. His face\nwas growing red.\n\n\"Because then I can talk about them to them,\" concluded Alwynne lucidly.\n\n\"Jolly for them!\" he commented indistinctly.\n\nAlwynne looked up.\n\n\"What, Roger?\"\n\n\"I said, 'Jolly for them!'\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Alwynne glanced at him in some uncertainty. Then, with a frown--\n\n\"Have you finished--already?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you.\"\n\n\"I haven't,\" remarked Alwynne, with sufficient point. Roger rose.\n\n\"You'll excuse me, won't you? I've a busy morning ahead of me.\"\n\nHe got up. But in spite of his protestations of haste he still stood at\nthe table, fidgeting over his pile of circulars and seed catalogues,\nwhile he coughed the preliminary cough of a man who has something to\nsay, and no idea of how to say it.\n\nAlwynne, meanwhile, had discovered the two letters that her napkin had\nhidden, and had neither ears nor eyes for him and his hesitations.\n\nRoger watched her gloomily as she opened the envelopes. The first\nenclosure was read and tossed aside quickly enough, but the other was\nevidently absorbing. He shrugged his shoulders at last, and, crossing\nthe room, took his warmed boots from the hearth. The supporting tongs\nfell with a crash.\n\nAlwynne jumped.\n\n\"Oh, Roger, you are noisy!\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Roger, but without conviction.\n\nShe looked across at him with a hint of perturbation in her manner. She\ndistrusted laconics.\n\n\"I say--is anything the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever!\" he assured her. \"Why?\" He bent over his boots.\n\n\"I don't know. You're rather glum to-day, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Roger, with a dignity that was marred by the sudden\nbursting of his over-tugged bootlace. His ensuing exclamation was\nvigorous and not inaudible. Alwynne giggled. It is not easy to tie a\nknot in four-sided leather laces. She watched his struggles without\nexcessive sympathy. Presently a neat twist of twine flicked through\nspace and fell beside him.\n\n\"'Just a little bit of string,'\" murmured Alwynne flippantly. But\ngetting no thanks, she returned to her letter. Roger fumbled in silence.\n\n\"The Dears are late,\" remarked Alwynne at last, as she folded her\nsheets.\n\n\"No--it's we who are early. I got down early on purpose. I thought you\nmight be, too. I wanted----\" he broke off abruptly.\n\n\"Yes, I always wake up at daybreak when I'm excited,\" she said joyously.\n\"Oh, Roger! How I'm looking forward to getting home! Clare says she may\nmeet me--if she feels like it,\" she beamed.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Roger.\n\nAlwynne tapped her foot angrily.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" she demanded. \"Why on earth do you sit\nthere and grunt at me like that? Why won't you talk? You're an absolute\nwet blanket--on my last morning. I wish The Dears would come down.\"\n\n\"I think I hear them moving,\" he said, and stared at the ceiling.\n\n\"I hope you do.\" Alwynne flounced from the table and picked up a paper.\n\nHe stood looking at her--between vexation and amusement, and another\nsensation less easily defined.\n\n\"Well, I must be off,\" he said at last.\n\nHe got no answer.\n\n\"Good-bye, Alwynne. Pleasant journey.\"\n\nAlwynne turned in a flash.\n\n\"Good-bye? Aren't you coming to see me off?\" she demanded blankly.\n\nHe hesitated, looking back at her from the open window, one foot already\non the terrace.\n\n\"I'm awfully busy. It's market-day, you know--and the new stuff's coming\nin. The Dears will see you off.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right.\" Alwynne was suddenly subdued. She held out a limp hand.\n\nHe disregarded it.\n\n\"Do you want me to come?\" He spoke more cheerfully.\n\n\"One always likes one's friends to see one off,\" she remarked sedately.\n\n\"And meet one?\" He glanced at the letter in her hand.\n\n\"And meet one. Certainly.\" Her chin went up. \"I hadn't to ask Clare. But\nyou needn't come. Good-bye!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm coming--now,\" he assured her, smiling.\n\nAlwynne's eyebrows went up.\n\n\"But it's market-day, you know----\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You're awfully busy.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The new stuff's coming in.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you coming, Roger?\"\n\n\"Yes, Alwynne.\"\n\n\"Then, Roger dear--if you are coming, and it's no bother, and you can\nspare them, would you bring me a tiny bunch of your roses? Not for\nme--for Clare. She does love them so. Do, Roger!\"\n\n\"I'm hanged if I do,\" cried Roger, and went his wrathful way.\n\nBut he did. A big bunch. More than enough for Clare.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nAlwynne was out of the train a dangerous quarter minute before it came\nto a standstill, and making for the bunch of violets that bloomed\nperennially in Elsbeth's bonnet. There followed a sufficiency of\nkissing. It was like a holiday home-coming, thought Alwynne, of not so\nvery long ago. But not so long ago she would have been exclusively\noccupied with Elsbeth, and her luggage, and her forgotten compartment;\nwould not have turned impatiently from her aunt to scan the length of\nthe platform. Not a sign of Clare? And Clare had promised to meet\nher....\n\nShe prolonged as long as she might her business with porters and ticket\ncollectors and outside-men, but Clare did not appear; and she left the\nstation at last, at her aunt's side, sedately enough, with the edge off\nthe pleasure of her home-coming.\n\nA telegram on the hall stand, however, contented her. Clare was sorry;\nClare was delayed; would be away another four days; was writing. Alwynne\nshook off her black dog, and the meeting with Clare still delightfully\nahead of her, was able to devote herself altogether to Elsbeth. Elsbeth\nspent a gay four days with an Alwynne grown rosy and cheerful,\naffectionate and satisfyingly garrulous again; found it very pleasant to\nhave Alwynne to herself, her own property, even for four days. Elsbeth\nmight know that she was second fiddle still, but though it cost her\nsomething to realise that she could never be first fiddle again, she\ncould be content to give place to Roger Lumsden. She shook her head over\nher inconsistency. She could school herself, rather than lose the girl's\nconfidence, to accept Clare Hartill as the main theme of Alwynne's\nconversation, till she was weary of the name, but she could not hear\nenough of Roger. All that Alwynne let fall of incident, description, or\napproval--Roger, Elsbeth discovered, had, in common with Clare, no\nfaults whatever--she stored up to compare, when Alwynne had gone to bed,\nwith letters, half-a-dozen by this time, that she kept locked up, with\ncertain other, older letters, in the absurd little secret drawer of her\ndesk. And she would patter across into Alwynne's room at last, to tuck\nin a sheet or twitch back a coverlet or merely to pretend to herself\nthat Alwynne was a baby still, and so, with a smile and a sigh, to her\nown room, to make her plain toilet and to say her selfless prayers to\nGod and her counterpane. Happy days and nights--four happy days and\nnights for Elsbeth.\n\nThen Clare came back.\n\nIt was natural that Alwynne should meet her and go home with her,\nportmanteau in hand, to spend a night or two.... Elsbeth agreed that it\nwas natural.... Three nights or even four.... But when a week passed,\nwith no sign from Alwynne but a meagre, apologetic postcard, Elsbeth\nthought that she had good cause for anger. Not, of course, with\nAlwynne ... never, be it understood, with Alwynne ... but most certainly\nwith Clare Hartill. Alwynne was so fatally good-natured.... Clare, she\nsupposed, had kept the child by a great show of needing her help....\nOf course, school was beginning, had begun already.... Clare would\nfind Alwynne useful enough.... No doubt it was pleasant to have some\none at her beck and call again in these busy first days of term....\nPossibly--probably--oh, she conceded the \"probably\"--Clare had missed\nAlwynne badly.... Had not Elsbeth, too, missed Alwynne?\n\nBut she answered Alwynne's postcard affectionately as usual. If Alwynne\nwere happier with Clare, Elsbeth would given no hint of loneliness. A\nhint, she knew, would suffice. Alwynne had a sense of duty. But she\nwanted free-will offering from Alwynne, not tribute.\n\nIn spite of herself, however, something of bitterness crept into her\nnext note to Roger Lumsden, who had inveigled her, she hardly knew how,\ninto regular correspondence. Her remark that _Alwynne has been away ten\ndays now_, was set down baldly, with no veiling sub-sentences of\nexplanation or excuse.\n\nHad she but known it, however, she was not altogether just to Alwynne.\nThe first hours of reunion did certainly drive her aunt out of Alwynne's\nmind, but after a couple of days she was ready to remind herself and\nClare that Elsbeth, too, had some claim on her time. It is possible,\nhowever, that had she been happier, she would have been less readily\nscrupulous. Clare had certainly been glad to see her, had, for an hour\nor two, been entirely delightful. But with the resumption of their\nmutual life Clare was not long in falling back into her old bad ways,\nand in revenge for her two months' boredom, in sheer teasing high\nspirits at Alwynne's return, as well as in unreasoning, petulant\njealousy, led Alwynne a pretty enough dance. For Clare was jealous,\njealous of these eight weeks of Alwynne's youth that did not belong to\nher, and between her jealousy and her own contempt for her jealousy, was\nin one of the moods that she and Alwynne alike dreaded.\n\nThe mornings at the school came as a relief to them both, but no sooner\nwere they together again than Clare's pricking devil must out. Scenes\nwere incessant--wanton, childish scenes. Yet Alwynne, sore and\nbewildered as she was by Clare's waxing unreasonableness, was yet not\nproof against the sudden surrenders that always contrived to put her in\nthe wrong. She would repeat to herself that it must be she who was\nunreasonable, that she should be flattered rather than distressed, for\ninstance, that Clare would not let her go home.... She would rather be\nwith Clare than Elsbeth, wouldn't she? Of course! well, then!...\nNevertheless she could not help wondering if any letters had come for\nher; if Elsbeth, expecting her daily, would bother to send them on....\nRoger had promised to write.... She thought that really she ought to go\nhome.\n\nBut Clare would not hear of her leaving. Elsbeth wanted Alwynne? So did\nshe. Didn't Elsbeth always have Alwynne? Surely Alwynne was old enough\nto be away from Elsbeth for a fortnight, without leave granted! Really,\nwith all due respect to her, Alwynne's aunt was a regular Old Man of the\nSea.\n\n\"Clare!\" Alwynne's tone had a hint of remonstrance.\n\n\"Oh, I said 'with all respect.' But if she were not your aunt I should\nreally be tempted to get rid of her--have you here altogether. You would\nlike that, Alwynne, eh?\"\n\nAlwynne refused to nod, but she laughed.\n\n\"'Get rid'? Clare, don't be absurd.\"\n\nClare looked at her, smiling, eyes narrowed in the old way.\n\n\"Do you think I couldn't get rid of her if I wanted to? I always do what\nI set out to do. Look at Henrietta Vigers.\"\n\nAlwynne sat bolt upright.\n\n\"Miss Vigers? But she resigned! She had been meaning to leave! She told\nus so! Do you mean that she didn't want to leave? Do you mean that she\nhad to?\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen a liner launched? You press an electric button, you\nknow--just a touch--it's awfully simple----\" She paused, eyes dancing.\n\nBut Alwynne had no answering twinkle.\n\n\"I wouldn't have believed it,\" she said slowly. Then, distractedly, \"But\nwhy, Clare, why? What possessed you?\"\n\n\"She got in my way,\" said Clare indolently.\n\nAlwynne turned on her, eyes blazing.\n\n\"You mean to say--you deliberately did that poor old thing out of her\njob? If you did----But I don't believe it. If you did----Clare, excuse\nme--but I think it was beastly.\"\n\n\"_Demon! With the highest respect to you_----\" quoted Clare, tongue in\ncheek.\n\nBut Alwynne was not to be pacified.\n\n\"Clare--you didn't, did you?\"\n\n\"My dear, she was in the way. She worried you and you worried me. I\ndon't like being worried.\"\n\nAlwynne shivered.\n\n\"Don't, Clare! I hate you to talk like that--even in fun. It's--it's so\ncold-blooded.\"\n\n\"In fun!\" Clare laughed lightly. Alwynne's youthful severity amused her.\nBut she had gone, she perceived, a trifle too far. \"Well, then, in\nearnest--joking apart----\"\n\nAlwynne's face relaxed. Of course, she had known all along that Clare\nwas in fun....\n\n\"Joking apart--it was time for Miss Vigers to go. I admit saying what I\nthought to Miss Marsham. I am quite ready to take responsibility. She\nwas too old--too fussy--too intolerant--I can't stand intolerance. She\nhad to go.\"\n\nAlwynne looked wicked.\n\n\"Clare, you remind me of a man I met, down at Compton. You ought to get\non together. He's great on tolerance too. So tolerant that five hundred\nyears ago he'd have burned every one who wasn't as tolerant as he. As it\nis, he shrugs them out of existence, _\u00c3\u00a0 la_ Podsnap. Just as you did\nMiss Vigers just now.\"\n\n\"Who was he?\"\n\n\"Don't know--only met him once. But he tickled me awfully. He hadn't the\nfaintest idea how funny he was.\"\n\n\"Did he shrug you out of existence?\"\n\n\"My dear Clare--could any one snub me? You might as well snub a rubber\nball.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're pretty thick-skinned.\" Clare paid her back reflectively.\n\nAlwynne winced.\n\n\"Am I? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be. How, just now?\"\n\nClare yawned.\n\n\"Well, for one thing, you needn't flavour your conversation exclusively\nwith Denes. They bore me worse than if they had an 'a' in them.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Alwynne paused. Then she plucked up courage. \"Clare, I\nstayed there two months. The Dene people are my friends, my great\nfriends. I don't think you need sneer at them.\"\n\nClare yawned again.\n\n\"I wonder you ever came back, if they're so absorbing. What is the\nparticular attraction there, by the way? The old women or the young\nmen?\"\n\nAlwynne's lips quivered.\n\n\"Clare, what has happened? What is the matter with you nowadays? Why are\nyou grown so different? Why are you always saying unkind things?\"\n\nClare shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Really, Alwynne, I am not accustomed to be cross-examined. Such a bore,\ngiving reasons. Besides, I haven't got any. Oh, don't look such a\nmartyr.\"\n\n\"I think I'll go home,\" said Alwynne in a low voice. \"I don't think you\nwant me.\"\n\n\"But Elsbeth does, doesn't she?\"\n\nClare settled herself more comfortably in the comfortable Chesterfield\nas she watched Alwynne out of the room. She lay like a sleepy cat,\nlistening to the muffled sounds of Alwynne's packing; let her get ready\nto her hat and her gloves and the lacing of her boots, before she called\nher back, and played with her, and forgave her at the last. Yet she\nfound Alwynne less pliable than usual: convicted of sin, she was yet\nresolved on departure, if not to-day--no, of course she would not go\nto-day, after behaving so ill to her Clare--then, the day following.\nThat would be Friday--a completed fortnight--and Saturday was Clare's\nbirthday--had Clare forgotten? Alwynne hadn't, anyhow. Oh, she must come\nfor Saturday, and what would Elsbeth say to that? There must be one\nevening, at least, given to Elsbeth in between. After all, it was jolly\ndull for Elsbeth all by herself.\n\nClare, good-tempered for the first time that afternoon, supposed it was,\nrather.\n\nBut on that particular day, Alwynne's qualms of conscience were\nunnecessary. Elsbeth was not at all dull. Elsbeth, on the contrary, was\ntremendously excited. And Elsbeth had forgotten all about Alwynne, was\nnot missing her in the least. Elsbeth had received a letter from Dene\nthat morning, and was expecting Roger Lumsden to supper.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nElsbeth spent her day in that meticulous and unnecessary arrangement and\nre-arrangement of her house and person, with which woman, since time\nwas, has delighted to honour man, and which he, the unaccountable, has\nas inevitably failed to notice. The clean cretonnes had arrived in time\nand were tied and smoothed into place; the vases new-filled; and the\nfire, though spring-cleaning had been, sprawled opulently in a brickless\ngrate. The matches, with the fifty cigarettes Elsbeth had bought that\nforenoon, hesitating and all too reliant upon the bored tobacconist,\nlay, aliens unmistakable, near Roger's probable seat, and the knowledge\nof the supper laid out in the next room fortified Elsbeth as, years ago,\na new frock might have done. Alwynne, in every age and stage, dotted the\npiano and occasional tables, and a photograph that even Alwynne had\nnever seen was placed on the mantelshelf, that Roger, greeting Elsbeth,\nmight see it and forget to be shy.\n\nBut it was Elsbeth that was shy, when Roger, very punctual, arrived amid\nthe chimes of the evening service. Yet Elsbeth had been ready since\nfive. They greeted each other in dumb show and sat a moment, smiling and\ntaking stock, while the clamour swelled, insisted, ebbed and died away.\n\nRoger, still silent, began to fumble at a case he carried, while Elsbeth\nfound herself apologetically and for the thousandth time wondering to\nher guest why she had taken root so near a church, while within herself\na hard voice cried exultantly, \"He's his father, his father over again!\nNothing of Rosemary there!\" and she tasted a little strange flash of\ntriumph over the dead woman she had been too gentle to hate.\n\nBut suddenly her lap was filled with roses, bunch upon tight masculine\nbunch, and the formal sentences broke up into incoherence as Roger\nstooped and kissed his second cousin Elsbeth.\n\nThey soon made friends. Roger, who had never quite forgotten her, found\nthe pleasant-faced spinster as attractive as the pretty lady of his\nchildhood. He examined her as he ate his supper. A spare figure, soft\ngrey hair, and square, capable hands; a kind mouth, not a strong one,\nset in lines firmer than were natural to it; gentle eyes, no longer\nbeautiful, and a cheerful, tired smile; a sweet face, thought Roger, not\na happy one. Yet she had Alwynne! She fluttered a little over the meal,\nand was anxious about his coffee, and full of little enquiries and\nattentions that were never irritating. There was a faint scent of\nverbena as she moved about him, and her silk gown did not crackle like\nyounger women's dresses. She listened well, but he guessed her no\ntalker, and later in the evening, gauged her affection for Alwynne by\nher breathless fluency. He thought her charming and a little pathetic,\nand wondered why nobody had ever insisted on marrying her.\n\nElsbeth's shyness soon dwindled; she slipped quickly into the informal\n\"aunt and nephew\" attitude that he evidently expected, and found his\nfriendliness and obvious pleasure in her as delightful as it was\nastonishing. She supposed, with a wistful little shrug, that she was\nnear the rose! Nevertheless she enjoyed herself.\n\nThey talked in narrowing circles: of his father a little; more of his\nmother; of Dene, and Elsbeth's former visits. He described Compton and\nThe Dears, and his gardens and his roses. Then, with a chuckle, an\nunauthorised attempt of Alwynne at pruning that had ended in disaster;\nand so plunged into confidences.\n\n\"I expect you've guessed that I intend--that I want to marry\nAlwynne,--with her permission,\" he added hastily, smiling down at her.\n\nElsbeth envied him his inches. For Alwynne's sake she did not intend to\nbe dominated; but she found his mere masculinity a little overpowering,\nand did not guess that her frail dignity had made its own impression.\n\nShe smiled back at him.\n\n\"I'm glad you put that in. You should respect grey hairs.\"\n\n\"But I do.\"\n\n\"No. You imply that I'm a very blind and foolish guardian! My dear boy,\"\nher pretty voice shook a little, \"I've hoped and prayed for this. You,\nJohn's boy, and--and dear Rosemary's, of course--and Alwynne, who's\ndearer to me than a daughter! Why, that's why I sent her down to Dene!\"\nShe blushed the rare blush of later middle age. \"Oh, my dear--it was\nshameless! I was matchmaking! I was! And I've always considered it so\nindelicate. But I wished so strongly that you two might come together.\nWhen Alwynne wrote of you so often, I hoped: and then your letters made\nme sure. You had got on so well without me these twenty-five years--and\nthen to feel the ties of kinship so very strongly all of a sudden--it\nwas transparent, Roger.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"I hadn't forgotten really--though it's the vaguest memory. You gave me\na rabbit in a green cabbage that opened. And one Sunday we shared Prayer\nBooks. You had a blue dress--a pale blue that one never sees nowadays,\nand very pink cheeks.\"\n\n\"Ah! the _cr\u00c3\u00aape de Chine_,\" said Elsbeth absently.\n\n\"I always remembered--though I'd forgotten I did. Alwynne brought it\nback. She's like you in some ways, you know. She made me awfully curious\nto see you again. From the way she talked I knew you'd be decent to me.\"\nHe smiled. \"Elsbeth--I'm tremendously in love.\"\n\n\"Have you told her so?\"\n\n\"Alwynne's rather difficult to get hold of. She doesn't understand\nanything but black and white.\"\n\n\"Clare Hartill--I suppose you've heard of Clare Hartill?\"\n\n\"Have I not!\"\n\n\"Clare Hartill says she has an uncanny ear for nuances.\"\n\n\"Also that she's thick-skinned! The woman's a fool.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's quite right, Roger, though I expect she was in a temper when\nshe said it. But it only means that Alwynne has been trained to listen\nto women. She can't follow men yet. She has been advised that they are\ngrown-up children and that her r\u00c3\u00b4le is to be superior but tactful.\"\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n\"Yes. When Alwynne's tactful--she's tactful! You can't mistake it, can\nyou? Have you ever seen her sidling out of a room when she thought she\nwasn't wanted? Still, she can hold her own, on occasion. She simply\nwalked through my hints. But--how does she talk of me, Elsbeth, if she\ndoes at all, that is?\"\n\n\"She likes you, in the 'good old Roger' fashion.\"\n\n\"But you do think I have a chance?\"\n\n\"That's why I wanted to see you. Frankly, at present I don't think you\nhave.\"\n\nHe looked at her coolly, not at all depressed.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Clare Hartill.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" He sat down at the table again, his chin in his fist. \"You think\nher the obstacle?\"\n\n\"I taught her once. Alwynne has been absorbed in her for two years.\nAlwynne talks----\" they both smiled. \"I could compare. I ought to know\nher pretty well.\"\n\n\"Yes. But how can she affect Alwynne and me? Of course I know what a lot\nAlwynne thinks of her. She's rather delightful on the subject. Thinks\nher perfection, and so on. Alwynne is na\u00c3\u00afve; conveys more than she knows\nor intends, sometimes. And she never looks at her god's feet, does she?\n'Clare' and 'Clare' and 'Clare.' Personally, I imagine her a bit of a\nbrute.\"\n\n\"I try to be fair. She is fond of Alwynne.\"\n\n\"Why not? But what's that got to do with Alwynne's caring for me, if I\nam lucky enough to make her? And I'm--conceitedly sure--that it's only a\nquestion of waking Alwynne up.\"\n\n\"You don't know Clare. If once she knows, she'll never let the child\ngo.\"\n\n\"But if Alwynne were engaged to me?\"\n\n\"She'll never allow it. She'll play on Alwynne's affection for her.\"\n\n\"But why? I shouldn't interfere with their friendship.\"\n\n\"My dear Roger--marriage ends friendship automatically. Clare would be\nshrewd enough to see that. And even--otherwise--she would never share.\nYou don't guess how jealous women are.\"\n\nRoger leant back in his chair with a gesture of bewilderment.\n\n\"My dearest cousin! The age of sorcery is over. You talk as if Alwynne\nwere under a spell.\"\n\n\"Practically she is. Of course Clare would put it on the highest\ngrounds--unsuitability--a waste of talents. She pretends to despise\ndomesticity. Alwynne would be hypnotised into repeating her arguments as\nher own opinion.\"\n\n\"Hypnotism?\"\n\n\"Oh, not literally. But she really does influence some women, and young\ngirls especially, in the most uncanny way. I've watched it so often.\"\n\n\"She's not married?\"\n\n\"She hardly ever speaks to a man. I've seen her at gaieties, when she\nwas younger. She was always rather stranded. Men left her alone.\nSomething in her seems to repel them. I think she fully realised it. And\nshe's a proud woman. There's tragedy in it.\"\n\n\"Does she repel you?\"\n\n\"Not in that way. I dislike her. I think her dangerous. I'm intensely\nsorry for her. And I do understand something of the attraction she\nexercises, better than you can, though it has never affected me. You\nsee--eccentricity--abnormality--does not affect women as it does men.\nAnd she's brilliantly clever.\"\n\n\"So is Alwynne--you wouldn't call her abnormal?\"\n\n\"Alwynne? Never! She's as sound and sweet as an apple. But--and it means\na good deal at her age--she's in abnormal hands. Clare Hartill is\nabnormal, spiritually perverse--and she's fastened on the child. They\nadore each other. It's terribly bad for Alwynne. As it is, it will take\nher months to shake off Clare's influence, even with you to help her.\nThat is, if you succeed in detaching her. I'm useless, of course.\nLoving--just loving--is no good. You can only influence if you are\nstrong enough to wound. I merely irritate. I'm weak. But you could do as\nyou like, I believe. Take her away from that selfish woman, Roger! It's\nblighting her.\"\n\n\"You think,\" he said, \"that she would be content with me--with marriage\nas a career? Of course, Miss Hartill's right about her talents.\"\n\n\"Alwynne? I don't think--I know. All her gifts are so much surface show;\nshe's a very simple child underneath. Content? Can't you see her,\nRoger--with children? Her own babies?\"\n\nRoger beamed.\n\n\"It's rather a jolly prospect. Well, I must take my chance.\"\n\n\"Of course, you must wait; it's too soon yet. Even later, if Clare\nreally wants her--wants her enough to suppress her own perverse\nimpulses--I'm afraid you've little chance. But it's possible that she\nwill not want her as much as that.\"\n\n\"I don't follow.\"\n\n\"I mean that Clare, with that impish nature of hers, may hurt Alwynne.\"\n\n\"I should think she has already, often enough.\"\n\n\"Yes--but Alwynne has never realised it, never realised that it was\ndeliberate. She is always so sure that it was her fault somehow. If\nonce she found out that Clare was hurting her for--for the fun of it,\nyou know--for the pleasure of watching her suffer--as I'm sure she\ndoes--it might end everything. Alwynne hates cruelty. That poor child's\ndeath shook her. A little more, and she will be disillusioned.\"\n\n\"But loyal still?\"\n\n\"Probably. But the glamour would be gone. She would be extremely\nunhappy. There your chance would come. Though I don't think Clare will\ngive it you--for I believe Alwynne does mean more to her than most\nthings. But she's an unaccountable person: there is the chance.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Roger rose and straightened himself. \"Practically I'm not to\ndepend on my own--attractions--at all.\" He laughed a little. \"I am to\nwatch the whims of this--this unpleasant school-marm, and be grateful to\nher for forcing Alwynne to prefer my deep sea to her devil. The\nsituation is hardly dignified.\"\n\nElsbeth laughed too.\n\n\"Love is always undignified, Roger. What does it matter if you want\nher?\" But she watched him anxiously as he walked to the window, and\nstood staring out.\n\nThere was a silence. At last he turned--\n\n\"Elsbeth, dear, it's a beautiful scheme, and a woman could carry it\nthrough, I daresay--but it's no good to me. It's too--too tortuous, too\nfeminine. I don't mean anything rude. It's merely that I'm not--subtle\nenough, or patient. At least, I haven't got that cat-and-mouse kind of\npatience. I can wait, you know. That's different. I can wait all right.\nBut I can't intrigue.\"\n\nElsbeth flushed.\n\n\"There is no intrigue. It's a question of understanding Alwynne and of\nusing the opportunity when it comes.\"\n\n\"To trick and surprise and over-persuade her into caring for me! It's no\ngood, Elsbeth. It isn't possession I want--it's Alwynne. Can't you see?\nWe should neither of us be happy. She would always distrust me and\nremember that I'd taken an advantage. I should end by hating her, I\nbelieve. Can't you see?\"\n\nElsbeth was shaken by her own thoughts.\n\n\"I see,\" she said finally. \"And I see that you don't love her--or you'd\ntake her on any terms.\"\n\n\"Would you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't. And I do love her. But I want Alwynne on my terms. Do\nI sound an awful prig? Cousin Elsbeth, hear my way! I'm going to have it\nout with Alwynne.\"\n\n\"At once?\"\n\n\"At once. As soon as I see her--no beating about the bush.\"\n\n\"Roger--she may be utterly out of the mood.\"\n\n\"Hang moods! I beg your pardon, Elsbeth. But I'm going to tell\nher--certain things. If she doesn't like it I'm going back to Dene.\nShe'll know where to find me when she changes her mind. Elsbeth, don't\nlook so hopeless.\"\n\n\"You don't understand Alwynne.\"\n\n\"I don't want to understand her--I want to marry her. I must stick to my\nown way. Can't you conceive that all this consideration, all this\ndeference to moods and dissection of motives, this horribly feminine\natmosphere that she seems to have lived in, of subtleties, and\nreservations, and simulations--may be bad for her? It seems to me that\nshe's always being thought about. You, with your anxious affection--that\nunholy woman with her lancet and probe--you neither of you leave her\nalone for a second. She's always being touched. Well, I'm going to leave\nher alone. It gives her a chance.\"\n\n\"I've never spoiled her.\" Elsbeth was off at a tangent.\n\n\"I'm sure of it. I can remember Father holding you up to Mother once. He\nsaid you were the most judicious woman with children that he knew.\"\n\n\"Did he?\" said Elsbeth.\n\n\"Mother was awfully annoyed.\" Roger chuckled. \"I'd been bawling for my\nfourth doughnut--and got it.\"\n\n\"I've never spoiled Alwynne,\" repeated Elsbeth tonelessly.\n\n\"No one could,\" remarked Roger with conviction.\n\nElsbeth looked up and laughed at him.\n\n\"So you are human!\" she said. \"I was beginning to doubt it.\"\n\n\"When I get on the subject of Alwynne's adorableness----\" he laughed\nback at her, \"we're obviously cousins, aren't we? But, really, I've been\ntrying to be detached, and critical, and analytical, and all the things\nyou feel are important. I wanted to see what you meant, Cousin Elsbeth;\nand I do see that we both want the same thing. But as to the means--I\nbelieve I must go my own way.\"\n\nShe eyed him doubtfully. But he looked very big and solid in the little\nroom, comfortingly sure of himself.\n\n\"You think me a frantic old clucking hen, don't you? And are just a\nlittle sorry for the duckling.\"\n\n\"I think you're a perfect dear,\" said Roger.\n\n\"You'll come to-morrow? Alwynne will be back, I hope.\"\n\n\"What time is she likely to turn up?\"\n\n\"About four, if she comes. She would lunch with Clare, I expect.\"\n\nHe nodded whimsically.\n\n\"Very well. To-morrow, at four precisely, there will be a row royal.\nTo-morrow I am calling on Miss Hartill to fetch Alwynne home. Good-bye,\nCousin Elsbeth.\"\n\nHe turned again in the doorway.\n\n\"Elsbeth, there's a house at Dene I've got my eye on. There's a turret\nroom. My best roses will clamber right into it. That's to be yours. And\nElsbeth! Nobody but you shall run the nursery.\"\n\nHe had shut the door before she could answer, and she heard him laugh as\nhe ran, two at a time, down the shallow steps.\n\nShe went to the window and watched till his strong figure had\ndisappeared in the dusk.\n\n\"He is very like his father,\" said Elsbeth wistfully, glancing across at\nthe faded likeness.\n\nThe dusk deepened and the stars began to twinkle.\n\n\"He will never be the man his father was,\" cried Elsbeth, suddenly and\ndefiantly.\n\nHer hands shook as she cleared away the remnants of the meal. She swept\nup the hearth, picked the coals carefully apart, and tidied the tidy\nroom. Roger's roses still lay in a heap in the basket chair. She\ngathered them up and carried them into the tiny bathroom, that they\nmight drink their fill all night. Their scent was strong and sweet. Then\nshe lit her candle and prepared for bed.\n\nThe sheets were very cold. She tried not to think of Roger's father\nlying in the grave she had never seen. The old, cruel longing was upon\nher for the sound of his voice and the sight of his face and the\nsweetness of his smile. She broke into painful weeping.\n\nThe hours wore past.\n\nOf course he would marry Alwynne.... Alwynne would be happy ... there\nwas comfort in that.... Roger would be kind to her.... A good boy ... a\ndear boy....\n\n\"And he might have been my son,\" cried out Elsbeth to the uncaring\nnight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\nRoger never fought his battle-royal with Clare, for at the turn of\nFriar's Lane he met Alwynne herself, dragging wearily along the\ncobblestones, weighed down by paper parcels and the heavy folds of the\nwaterproof hanging on her arm. Her hair was roughened by the wind that\ntugged and strained at her loosened hat; her face was drawn and shadowy;\nshe had an air of exhaustion, of indefinable demoralisation that Roger\nrecognised angrily. He had seen it in the first weeks of her visit to\nDene. Her thoughts were evidently far away, and she would have passed\nhim without a look if he had not stopped her. She started violently as\nhe spoke--it was like rousing a nightmare-ridden sleeper--then her face\ngrew radiant.\n\n\"Roger!\" she cried, and beamed at him like a delighted child.\n\nHe possessed himself of her parcels and they walked on, Alwynne's\nquestions and exclamations tumbling over each other. Roger at\nUtterbridge! Why had he come? How long was he staying? How were The\nDears and how did Dene spare him? When had he arrived?\n\nRoger dropped his bomb.\n\n\"Yesterday. I went to supper with Elsbeth. We had a long talk.\"\n\nHis tone conveyed much. The brightness died out of Alwynne's face. She\nlooked surprised and excessively annoyed.\n\n\"She knew you were coming?\"\n\n\"She did.\"\n\n\"Why on earth didn't she let me know? Why, she doesn't know you! She\nhasn't seen you since you were a kid! It's extraordinary of Elsbeth.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't let her.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't let her?\" Alwynne looked at him blankly. \"Roger--I think\nyou're cracked.\"\n\n\"Terse and to the point! Don't you worry. Elsbeth and I understand each\nother. Besides, we've been corresponding.\"\n\n\"You and Elsbeth?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's partly why I came. I wanted to get to know her. You see,\nyour description and her letters didn't tally. So I came. We got on\njolly well. I burst in on her again at breakfast this morning. She\ndidn't fuss--took it like a lamb. I fancy you underrate our cousin--in\nmore ways than one. She knows it too; she's no fool! I found that out\nwhen we talked about you.\"\n\n\"Elsbeth discussed me?--with you?\" Alwynne's tone foreboded a bad\nhalf-hour to Elsbeth.\n\n\"Why not? You're not sacred, are you?\" Roger chuckled.\n\nAlwynne felt inclined to box his ears. Here was a new Roger. Roger--her\nown property--to take such an attitude--to ally himself with Elsbeth--to\nleave her in the dark! Roger! It was unthinkable.... And she had been so\nawfully glad to see him ... absurdly glad to see him ... he had made her\nforget even Clare.... Clare.... She began to occupy her mind once more\nwith the scene of the previous day, recalling what she had said;\ncontrasting it with what she had intended to say; stabbed afresh by\nClare's manner; writhing at her own helplessness; when Roger's slow\nvoice brought her thoughts back to the present.\n\n\"You've been away from Elsbeth a fortnight,\" he said accusingly, as they\nentered the Town Gardens.\n\nShe flared anew at his tone.\n\n\"Certainly. I've been staying with friends. Have you any objection?\"\n\n\"A friend,\" he corrected.\n\nShe flushed.\n\n\"Clare Hartill is my best friend----\"\n\n\"Your worst, you mean.\"\n\nShe turned on him.\n\n\"How dare you say that? How dare you speak of my friends like that? How\ndare you speak to me at all?\"\n\nHe continued, quite unmoved--\n\n\"Don't be silly, Alwynne. Your best friend is your Aunt Elsbeth--you\nought to know that. You don't treat her well, I think. You've been away\na fortnight with that--friend of yours; you stayed on without consulting\nher----\"\n\n\"I telephoned,\" cried Alwynne, in spite of herself.\n\n\"Since then you've sent her one post card. She isn't even sure that\nyou're coming back to-day; she's just had to sit tight and wait until\nit's your--no, I'll give you your due--until it's your friend's pleasure\nto send you back to her, fagged out, miserable--just like my dog after a\nthrashing. And Elsbeth's to comfort you, and cosset you, and put you to\nrights--and then you'll go back to that woman again, to have the\nstrength and the spirit drained out of you afresh--and you walk along\ntalking of your best friend. I call it hard luck on Elsbeth.\"\n\nAlwynne's careful dignity was forgotten in her anger. She turned on him\nlike a furious schoolgirl.\n\n\"Will you stop, please? How dare you speak of Clare? If Elsbeth chooses\nto complain----What affair is it of yours anyhow? I'll never speak to\nyou again--never--or Elsbeth either.\" Her voice broke--she was on the\nverge of tears.\n\nRoger took her by the arm, and drew her to a seat.\n\n\"You'd better sit down,\" he said. \"We've heaps to talk over yet, more\nthan you've a notion of. And if we're to have a row, let's get it over\nin the open--far less dangerous. Never get to cover in a thunderstorm. I\nknow what you want.\" He had watched her fumbling unavailingly in the bag\nand pocket and had chuckled. He knew his Alwynne. He produced a clean\nsilk handkerchief and dangled it before her. She clutched at it with\nundignified haste.\n\n\"'Thank you,' first,\" he said, holding it firmly. A moment victory hung\nin the balance. Then--\n\n\"Oh! Oh, thank you,\" said Alwynne, with fine unconcern, and secured it.\nTheir eyes met. It was impossible not to smile.\n\n\"At the same time,\" remarked Alwynne, a little later, \"you've no right\nto talk to me like that, Roger, whatever you choose to think. You're not\nmy cousin.\"\n\n\"I'm Elsbeth's. It strikes me she needs defending.\"\n\nAlwynne laughed.\n\n\"You know I'm awfully fond of Elsbeth. You know I am. I am a beast\nsometimes to her, you're quite right--but she doesn't really need\ndefending. Honestly.\"\n\n\"Not from you, I know. But frankly, without wanting to be rude to your\nfriend--I think she makes you careless of Elsbeth's feelings. Elsbeth\nwas awfully hurt this week, and she's the sort of dear one hates to see\nhurt.\"\n\nAlwynne looked at him wistfully.\n\n\"Roger,\" she said hesitatingly, \"suppose some one were unkind to\nme--hurt me--hurt me badly, very often, almost on purpose--would you\ndefend me? Would you care at all?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't let 'em,\" he grunted.\n\n\"If you couldn't help it?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't let 'em,\" he repeated doggedly.\n\n\"But should you care?\"\n\n\"Of course I should. What rot you talk. Of course I should. But I\nshouldn't let them.\"\n\n\"Oh, Roger,\" she cried, suddenly and pitifully, \"they do hurt me\nsometimes--they do, they do.\"\n\nRoger looked around him with unusual caution. The Gardens were empty.\nThere was not even a loafer in sight. He put his arm round her, and drew\nher clumsily to him. She yielded like a tired child, and lay quietly,\nstaring with brimming eyes at the gaudy tulip-bed on the further side\nof the walk.\n\n\"I believe you're about fed up with that school of yours,\" he said,\nafter a time, as if he had not followed the allusion to Clare.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm not lazy, Roger; you know it's not that. It's just the atmosphere,\nand the awful crowding. Such a lot of women at close quarters, all\nenthusiasm and fussing and importance. They're all hard-working, and all\nunselfish and keen--more than a crowd of men would be, I believe. But\nthat's just it--they're dears when you get them alone, but somehow, all\ntogether, they stifle you. And they all have high voices, that squeak\nwhen they're keenest. D'you know, that was what first made me like you,\nRoger--your voice? It's slow, and deep, and restful--such a reasonable\nvoice. You mustn't think me disloyal to the school. The girls are all\nfrightfully interesting, and the women are dears, and there's always\nClare--only we do get on each other's nerves.\"\n\n\"A boys' school is just the same.\"\n\n\"Is it? I've only seen Compton. I don't know how co-education affects\nthe boys, but I'm sure it's good for the girls, and the mistresses too.\nOf course, they're not really different to my lot, but they seemed so.\nThey had room to move. They weren't always rubbing up against each other\nlike apples in a basket. It all seemed so natural and jolly. Fresh air\neverywhere. And since I've been back, I've felt I couldn't breathe. I\nbelieve it's altered me, just seeing it all; and I can't make Clare\nunderstand. She thinks I liked Dene because I wanted to flirt.\"\n\n\"That type would.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you think that,\" she answered uneasily, \"but she\nisn't--that horrid type. That's why it hurts so that she can't\nunderstand. As if I ever thought of such a thing until she talked of it!\nOnly I like talking to men, you know, Roger; because they've often got\nquite interesting minds, and it's easier to find out what they really\nthink than with women. But they bore Clare.\"\n\n\"Do they?\" Roger had his own opinion on the question. But he found that\nit was difficult to refrain from kissing Alwynne when she looked at him\nwith innocent eyes and made preposterous statements; so he stared at the\ntulips.\n\n\"You see, she thinks--we both think, that if you've got a--a really real\nwoman friend, it's just as good as falling in love and getting married\nand all that--and far less commonplace. Besides the trouble--smoking,\nyou know--and children. Clare hates children.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" Roger looked at her gravely.\n\n\"Me? I love them. That's the worst of it. When I grew old, I'd meant to\nadopt some--only Clare wouldn't let me, I'm sure. Of course, as long as\nClare wanted me, I shouldn't mind. To live with Clare all my life--oh,\nyou know how I'd love it. I just--I love her dearly, Roger, you know I\ndo--in spite of things I've told you. Only--oh, Roger, suppose she got\ntired of me. And, since I've been back, sometimes I believe she is.\"\n\n\"Poor old girl!\"\n\n\"It's a shame to grizzle to you; it can't be interesting; and, of\ncourse, I don't mean for one moment to attack Clare; only everything I\ndo seems wrong. When she sneers, I get nervous; and the more nervous I\nget, the more I do things wrong--you know, silly things, like spilling\ntea and knocking into furniture. And she gets furious and then we have a\nscene. It's simply miserable. We had one yesterday, and again this\nmorning. It's my fault, of course--I get on her nerves.\"\n\n\"You never get on my nerves,\" said Roger suggestively.\n\n\"Not when I chop up your best pink roses?\" She looked at him sideways,\ndimpling a little.\n\n\"As long as you don't chop up your own pink fingers--you've got pretty\nfingers, Alwynne----\"\n\n\"Roger, you're a comforting person. I wish--I wish Clare would treat me\nas you do, sometimes. You pull me up too, but you never make me\nnervous. I'm sure I shouldn't disappoint her so often, if she did.\"\n\n\"Alwynne,\" he returned with a twinkle, \"stop talking. I've made a\ndiscovery.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You're ten times fonder of me than you are of that good lady. Now, own\nup.\"\n\n\"Roger!\" Alwynne was outraged. She made efforts to sit upright, but\nRoger's arm did not move. It was a strong arm and it held her, if\nanything, a trifle more firmly. \"You're talking rot. Please let me sit\nup.\"\n\n\"You're all right. It's quite true, my child, and you know it. Ah,\nyes--they're a lovely colour, aren't they?\"\n\nFor Alwynne was gazing at the tulips with elaborate indifference.\nSecretly she was a little excited. Here was a new Roger.... He was quite\nmad, of course, but rather a dear.... She wondered what he would say\nnext....\n\n\"To examine our evidence. You were very glad to see me--now weren't\nyou?\"\n\n\"I'm always pleased,\" remarked Alwynne sedately to the tulips, \"to see\nold friends.\"\n\n\"Yes--but we're not old friends exactly, if you refer to length of\nacquaintanceship. If to age--I was thirty last March. I'm not doddering\nyet.\"\n\n\"I wasn't speaking of ages. Thirty is perfectly young. Clare's\nthirty-five. You do fish, Roger.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm going to have a haul some day soon, I hope. But to resume.\nFirstly, you were jolly glad to see me. Secondly, you took your lecture\nvery fairly meekly--for you! and you've already had one talking-to\nto-day during which, I gather, you were anything but meek.\"\n\n\"I never told you----\"\n\n\"But there was a glint in your eye----You've no idea how invariably\nyour face gives you away, Alwynne. Thirdly, you've hinted quite\nhalf-a-dozen times that Miss Hartill would be all the better for a few\nof my virtues. Tenth, and finally, you've made my coat collar\nthoroughly damp--you needn't try to move--and I don't exactly see you\nspoiling your Clare's Sunday blouse that way, often, eh?\"\n\nAlwynne was obliged to agree with the tulips.\n\n\"I thought so. Therefore I say, after considering all the evidence--in\nyour heart of hearts you are ten times fonder of me than of Miss Clare\nHartill.\"\n\nThe trap was attractively baited. Impossible for an Alwynne to resist\nanalysis of her own emotions. She walked into it.\n\n\"I don't know--I wonder if you're right? Perhaps I am _fonder_ of you. I\nlove Clare--that's quite a different thing. One couldn't be fond of\nClare. That would be commonplace. She's the sort of wonderful person you\njust worship. She's like a cathedral--a sort of mystery. Now you're like\na country cottage, Roger. Of course, one couldn't be fond of a\ncathedral.\"\n\n\"A cottage,\" remarked Roger to the tulips in his turn, \"can be made a\nvery comfortable place. Especially if it's a good-sized one--Holt\nMeadows, for instance. My tenants leave in June, did you know? There's a\nsouth wall and a croquet ground.\"\n\n\"Tennis?\"\n\nRoger was afraid the tulips would find it too small for tennis.\n\n\"But a court could be made in Nicholas Nye's paddock,\" Alwynne reminded\nthem.\n\nRoger thought it would be rather fun to live there, tennis or no\ntennis--didn't the tulips think so?\n\nThe tulips did, rather.\n\n\"One could buy Witch Wood for a song, I believe; you know it runs along\nthe paddock. Think of it, all Witch Wood for a wild garden.\"\n\n\"And no trespassers! No trampled hyacinths any more! Or ginger-beer\nbottles! Oh, Roger!\" A delighted, delightful Alwynne was forgetting all\nabout the tulips; but they nodded very pleasantly for all that.\n\n\"A footpath through to The Dears' garden, and my glass-houses. And\nchickens in a corner of the paddock. You'd have to undertake those.\"\n\n\"All white ones!\"\n\n\"Better have Buff Orpingtons. Lay better. Remember Jean's troubles:\n'Really, the Amount of Eggs----'\"\n\n\"Dear Jean. And besides, I shall want some for clutches. I adore them\nwhen they're all fluff and squeak; and ducklings too, Roger. We won't\nhave incubators, will we?\"\n\n\"Rather not. Lord, it will be sport. You're to wear print dresses at\nbreakfast, Alwynne--lilac, with spots.\"\n\n\"You're very particular----\"\n\n\"Like that one you wore at the Fair----you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, that one! Do you mean to say----All right. But I shall wear\ntea-gowns every afternoon--with lace and frillies. Elsbeth says they're\ntheatrical.\"\n\n\"All right! We'll eat muffins----\"\n\n\"And read acres of books----\"\n\n\"May I smoke?\"\n\n\"It'll get into the curtains----\"\n\n\"I'll get you a new lot once a week----\"\n\n\"And we won't ever be at home to callers----\"\n\n\"Just us two.\"\n\nAlwynne sighed contentedly.\n\n\"Oh, Roger, it would be rather nice. You can invent beautifully.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Then we'll consider that settled.\"\n\nHe bent his head and kissed her.\n\nA very light kiss--a very airy and fugitive attempt at a kiss--a kiss\nthat suited the moment better than his mood; but Roger could be Fabian\nin his methods. Alwynne rather thought that it was a curl brushing her\nforehead: the tulips rather thought it wasn't. Roger could have settled\nthe matter, but they did not like to appeal to him. They were all a\nlittle disturbed--more than a little uncertain how to act. The tulips'\nattitude was frankly alarming to Alwynne, who (if the kiss had really\nhappened) was prepared to be dignified and indignant. The tulips,\nhowever, appeared to think a kiss a pleasant enough indiscretion. \"To\nsome one, at any rate, we are worth the kissing,\" quoth the tulips\ndefiantly, with irreverent eyes on a vision of Clare's horrified face.\nThen, veering smartly, they reminded Alwynne, that from a patient,\nprotective Roger it was the most brotherly and natural of sequels to\ntheir make-believe. Alwynne was not so sure; Roger was developing\ncharacteristics of which the kiss (had it taken place) was not the least\nexciting and alarming symptom. He was no longer the Roger of Dene days,\nnot a month dead; or rather, the Dene Roger was proving himself but a\nfacet of a many-sided personality--big, too--that was more than a match\nfor a many-sided Alwynne, with moods that met and enveloped hers, as a\nwoman's hands will catch and cover a baby's aimless fist. More than his\nstrength, his gentleness disturbed her. So long a prisoner to Clare,\never bruising herself against the narrow walls of that labyrinthine\nmind--she would have been indifferent to any harshness from him; but his\nkindliness, his simplicity, unnerved her. He had been right--she had her\npride. Clare did not often guess when her self-control was undermined.\nBut with Roger--what was the use of pretending to Roger? It had been\ncomforting to have a good cry. His kiss had been comforting too. She\nremembered the first of Clare's rare kisses--the thin fingers that\ngripped her shoulders; the long, fierce pressure, mouth to mouth; the\nrough gesture that released her, flung her aside.\n\nBut Roger--if, indeed, she had not dreamed--had been comforting. Here\nthe tulips broke in whimsically with the brazen suggestion that it would\nbe delightful to put one's arms round Roger's neck and return that\nsupposititious kiss. A remark, of course, of which no flower but a\nflaunting scarlet tulip could be capable. Alwynne was horrified at the\ntulips. Horrified by the tulips, worried by her own uncertainties,\npuzzled by the imperturbable face smiling down at her. Certainly not a\nconscience-stricken face. Probably the entire incident was a wild\nimagining of the tulips. She had watched those nodding spring devils\nlong enough. Time to go home: at any rate it was time to go home.\n\nIt puzzled her anew that Roger's arm was no longer about her, that he\nshould make no effort to detain her, or to reopen the conversation; that\nhe should walk at her side in his usual fashion, originating nothing.\nOnce or twice, glancing up at him, she surprised a smile of inscrutable\nsatisfaction, but he did not speak; he merely met her eyes steadily,\nstill smiling, till she dropped her own once more. A month ago she would\nhave challenged that smile, cavilled and cross-examined. To-day she was\nquaintly intimidated by it. Indeed a new Roger! She never dreamed of a\nnew Alwynne.\n\nYet for all her perplexity and very real physical fatigue, Alwynne\nwalked with a light step and a light heart. As usually she was absurdly\ntouched by his unconscious protective movements--the touch on her arm at\ncrossings--the juggle of places on the fresh pathway--the little\ncourtesies which the woman-bred girl had practised, without receiving,\nappealed to her enormously. She felt like a tall school-child,\n\"gentleman\" perforce at all her dancing lessons, who, at her first ball,\ncomes delightedly into her own.\n\nShe gave Roger little friendly glances as they walked home, but no\nwords; though she could have talked had he invited. But Roger was\nresolutely silent, and for some obscure reason this embarrassed her more\nthan his previous loquacity. Gradually she grew conscious of her\ncrumpled dress and loosened hair; that a button was missing on her\nglove! trifles not often wont to trouble her. She wondered if Roger had\nnoticed the button's absence; she hoped fervently that he had not. She\nglanced obscurely at shop-windows, whose blurred reflections could not\nhelp her to the conviction that her hat was straight. Also it dawned\nupon her that Roger was weighed down by preposterous parcels; that the\nparcels were her own. She was sure the string was cutting his fingers.\nShe was penitent, knowing that she would not be allowed to relieve him,\nand hugely annoyed with herself. She had been scolded often enough for\nher parcel habit, and had laughed at Elsbeth; and here was Elsbeth\nproved entirely right. Weighing down Roger like this! What would he\nthink of her? He had not spoken for ten minutes.... Of course--he was\nannoyed.... They had better get home as quickly as might be....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n\nElsbeth, sitting at the window, had seen them come down the street, and\nwas at the door to welcome them. Alwynne was kissed, rather gravely, but\nElsbeth and Roger greeted each other like the oldest of trusted friends.\nAlwynne's eyebrows lifted, but Elsbeth ignored her. She scolded Roger\nfor being late, showed him his roses, revived and fragrant in their blue\nbowls; and when Alwynne turned to go and dress, declared that he looked\nstarved, that supper was long overdue, and must be eaten at once. Roger\nseconded her, and to supper they went.\n\nAlwynne raged silently. What was the matter with Elsbeth? She had barely\ngreeted her.... And now to be so inconsiderate.... To insist on sitting\ndown to supper then and there, without giving her time to make herself\ndecent! Couldn't she see how tired Alwynne was, how badly in need of\nsoap and water and a brush and comb, let alone a prettier frock? It\nwasn't fair! Elsbeth might know she would want to look nice--with Roger\nthere.... She did not choose to look a frump, however Elsbeth dressed\nherself....\n\nIt dawned on her, however, as Elsbeth, resigning the joint to Roger,\nbegan to mix a salad under his eye, after some particular recipe of his\nimparting, that Elsbeth, on this occasion, was looking anything but a\nfrump. She wore her best dress of soft, dark purple stuff, and the scarf\nof fine old lace, that, as Alwynne very well knew, saw the light on high\nand holy days only; and a bunch of Roger's roses were tucked in her\nbelt. Her hair was piled high in a fashion new to Alwynne: a tiny black\nvelvet bow set off its silvery grey; it was waved, too, and clustered\nbecomingly at the temples. Alwynne, gasping, realised that Elsbeth must\nhave paid a visit to the local coiffeur. She realised also, for the\nfirst time, how pretty, in delicate, pink-may fashion, her aunt must\nonce have been.\n\nAt any other time Alwynne would have been delighted at the improvement,\nfor she was proud of Elsbeth, in daughterly fashion, and had wrestled\nuntiringly with her indifference to dress. She knew she should have\nhailed the change, but, to her own annoyance, she found it irritating.\nIt displeased her that she herself should be dishevelled and day-worn,\nwhile Elsbeth faced her, cool and dainty and dignified. Roger was\nobviously impressed.... Roger, to whom Elsbeth had been so carefully,\ndeprecatingly explained.... It made Alwynne look such a fool.... How was\nshe to know that Elsbeth would have this whim? She had never guessed\nthat Elsbeth could make herself look so charming.... And she to be in\nher street clothes ... with her hair like a mouse's nest! It was too\nbad! However, it didn't seem to matter.... Roger, it was clear enough,\nhad no eyes for her....\n\nHer resentment grew. She attempted to join in the conversation, but\nthough Roger listened gravely, and answered politely--she never caught\nthe twinkle in his eye--he invariably flung back the ball to Elsbeth as\nquickly as might be. She mentioned Dene; made intimate allusions to\ntheir walks and adventures; and he turned to explain them, to include\nElsbeth, with a pointedness that made Alwynne pink with vexation. She\nbegan to long to get him to herself ... to quarrel or make peace, as he\npleased ... but anyhow to get him to herself.... Couldn't one have a\nmoment's conversation without dragging Elsbeth into it? So absurd of\nRoger....\n\nSlowly she realised that neither Roger nor Elsbeth were finding her\nindispensable, and her surprise was only rivalled by her indignation.\nElsbeth particularly--it was simply beastly of Elsbeth--was being, in\nher impalpable way, unapproachable.... She was angry about\nsomething.... Alwynne knew the signs.... She, Alwynne, supposed that\nshe ought to have written.... But she did write a postcard.... One\ncouldn't be everlastingly writing letters.... Any one but Elsbeth would\nhave waived the matter, with a visitor present, but Elsbeth was so\nvindictive.... Here Alwynne's rebellious conscience allied itself with\nher sense of humour, to protest against the picture of a vindictive\nElsbeth. They bubbled with tender laughter at the idea. Alwynne must\nneeds laugh with them, a trifle remorsefully, and admit that the idea\nwas fantastic; that Elsbeth, in all the years she had known her, had\nbeen the most meek and forgiving of guardians; and that she, Alwynne,\nhad been undeniably negligent. Nevertheless, why must Elsbeth show Roger\nthe kitchen? What was he saying to her out there? And why were they both\nlaughing like that?\n\n\"Cackle, cackle, cackle,\" muttered Alwynne viciously; \"awfully funny,\nisn't it?\"\n\nShe continued her reflections.\n\nFussing over clearing the supper still! One of Elsbeth's absurd ideas,\njust because it was the maid's evening out.... Let her do it when she\ncame back! Such a fuss and excitement always! What would Roger think of\nthem? What a long time they were! She might take the opportunity of\ngoing to change her frock.... She hesitated. What was that? What was\nRoger saying? She caught the murmur of his deep voice and her aunt's\nstaccato in answer, but the words were blurred.\n\nAfter all--why should she bother to change? Elsbeth would be sure to\nmake unnecessary remarks.... And Roger wouldn't care--he was too\noccupied with Elsbeth.... Nobody cared--nobody wanted her.... She would\ngo back to Clare to-morrow.... But if Clare were in to-day's humour\nstill?\n\nWhat a wretched week it had been.... Even if Clare had not been so\nmoody, Alwynne would have felt ill at ease ... she had known perfectly\nwell that she owed the first weeks of her return to her aunt ... but at\na hint from Clare she had stifled her conscience and stayed.... And now\nElsbeth, she could tell, was deeply hurt.... Once away from Clare,\nAlwynne could reflect and be sorry.... She wouldn't have believed that\nshe could be so careless of Elsbeth's feelings.... She was suddenly and\ngenerously furious with herself. How selfish, how abominably selfish she\nhad been.... No wonder Roger had been shocked! Of course neither he nor\nElsbeth could ever understand how difficult it was to withstand\nClare.... It had been possible once.... Her thought strayed to that\nearly Christmas when she had resisted all Clare's arguments.... But now\nshe had no choice.... However determined one might be beforehand--and\nshe had intended to return that first day--one's will was beaten aside,\nblown about like a straw in a strong wind.... If only Roger would\nunderstand that.... She hated him to think her so selfish.... Elsbeth\nneedn't have told him, she thought resentfully ... it was not like\nElsbeth to give her away.... She supposed she had hurt Elsbeth's\nfeelings pretty badly.... Why, oh why, hadn't she been firmer with\nClare? She had only to say, quite quietly, that she must do what she\nfelt to be right.... Clare couldn't have eaten her....\n\nShe began to rehearse the conversation; it soothed her to compose the\ntelling phrases she might have uttered. They sounded all right ... but,\nof course, face to face with Clare she could never have said them....\nClare, in indifference, displeasure or appeal, would have conquered\nwithout battle given ... in her heart she knew that.\n\nShe moved uneasily about the room, deep in thought. For the first time\nher attitude to Clare struck her as contemptible.... What had Roger\nsaid? \"Like a dog after a thrashing.\" Intolerable! She flung up her\nhead, her pride writhing under the phrase. So that was how it struck\noutsiders! Outsiders? She didn't care a dead leaf for outsiders.... Let\nthem think what they chose! But Roger? And Elsbeth? Did they really\nthink her weak and enslaved? It stung her that Roger should think so\nmeanly of her. She told herself that the loss of his opinion in no way\naffected her--and instantly began to revolve within herself phrases,\nexplanations, actions, wherewith to regain it. And there was Elsbeth....\nHe had thought her unkind to Elsbeth.... He was right there! She saw,\nremorsefully, with her usual thoroughness, that she had been, for many a\nlong year, as the plagues of Egypt to her Elsbeth.\n\nShe flung herself on the prim little sofa, and stared at the closed door\nuncertainly. She was too proud to do what she wanted to do--invade the\nkitchen, and regardless of Roger's eyes and presence, confess to\nElsbeth, and receive absolution. A word, she knew, would be enough....\nIf Elsbeth felt as miserable as she did--a word would be more than\nenough....\n\nElsbeth and Roger, returning to the sitting-room, ended her indecision.\nTheir manner had changed--Roger was quieter--less talkative--but Elsbeth\nwas so radiant that Alwynne decided that contrition could wait. More\nthan ever she realised that two were company....\n\nHer anger grew again as she watched and listened.\n\nElsbeth had produced cards, and suggested three-handed bridge. Alwynne\nexcused herself, and Roger, who had been her partner on occasion at\nDene, was obviously relieved. His Alwynne was the One Woman--but she\ncould not play bridge!\n\nHe settled down to double-dummy with Elsbeth. The conversation became a\nrapt and technical duet, punctuated with interminable pauses.\n\nAlwynne fumed.\n\nSo this was Elsbeth's idea of a really pleasant evening! Cards! Beastly,\nidiotic cards! Roger, her Roger, had come up all the way from Dene to\nplay cards with Elsbeth! Had he just? All right then! He should have all\nthe cards he wanted--and more! As for Elsbeth--catch Alwynne telling her\nshe was sorry now!\n\nThe striking of the clock gave her her opportunity. She rose, yawning\nelaborately.\n\n\"I'm going to bed,\" she remarked to the card-table.\n\n\"Are you, dear?\" said Elsbeth.\n\n\"Oh! Oh, good-night,\" said Roger casually rising, and sitting down\nagain. \"Your shout, Elsbeth.\"\n\nElsbeth went \"no trumps.\"\n\nAlwynne lingered.\n\n\"Of course the kitchen fire's out?\" she said, with sour suggestiveness.\n\n\"Do you want a bath? Yes, of course. Do you know, my dear, you're\nlooking rather grubby?\" Elsbeth paid her sweetly. \"I expect the water\nwill still be hot, if you're quick. Don't forget to turn the light off,\nwill you, when you've finished?\"\n\nAlwynne made no answer, but she still lingered. Elsbeth, finishing her\nhand, spoke over her shoulder--\n\n\"Alwynne, dear, either go out, or come in and sit down. There's such a\ndraught.\"\n\nThere was a swish of skirts, and all the innumerable ornaments rattled\non their shelves. Alwynne had permitted herself the luxury of banging\nthe door.\n\nRoger laughed like a schoolboy.\n\n\"'All is not well!'\" he quoted.\n\nElsbeth laughed too, yet half against her will.\n\n\"My poor Alwynne! She hates me to be annoyed with her. It infuriates\nher. She'll be awfully penitent to-morrow. It's really rather comical,\nyou know. She'll take criticism from any one else--but I must approve\nimplicitly! And you being here didn't improve matters. She was longing\nto be nice, and I didn't help her. She was quite aware that she was\nshowing you her worst side, and quite unable to get out of the mood. I\nknew, bless her heart!\"\n\nShe looked at him with a quick little gesture of appeal.\n\n\"Roger--you do understand? That--tantrum--meant nothing. She's such an\nimpulsive child.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"I know. Don't you worry. Besides, it was my fault. I was teasing her\nall the evening. It was not what she expected. Oh, I'm growing subtle\nenough to please even you, Elsbeth. You know, she's had rather a full\nday. Evidently a scorching afternoon with that delightful friend of\nhers, to start with----\"\n\n\"Ah?\" said Elsbeth, her eyes brightening.\n\n\"Oh, yes; she was distinctly chastened. I improved the occasion, and\nyou've about finished her off, the poor old girl! I was expecting that\nlittle exhibition.\"\n\n\"I believe--I believe you enjoy upsetting her,\" began Elsbeth, rather\nindignantly.\n\n\"Of course I do. It's as good as a play!\"\n\nElsbeth sighed.\n\n\"Well--I suppose it's all right. You'll have to manage her for the\nfuture, not I.\"\n\n\"Oh, she'll do all the managing,\" said Roger ruefully. \"I foresee that\nthis is my last stand. She's just a trifle in awe of me, at present, you\nknow, though she doesn't know it. But it won't last. And then--heaven\nhelp me! But, you know, Cousin Elsbeth--to be henpecked by\nAlwynne--don't you think it will be quite pleasant?\"\n\n\"It is. She's bullied me since she was three. Oh, Roger, I shall miss\nher.\" She blinked rapidly.\n\nRoger stared away from her in awkward sympathy.\n\n\"You shan't, not very much,\" he said. \"We'll fix things. You'll have to\ncome and settle with us.\"\n\nElsbeth fidgeted.\n\n\"You know, you took my breath away in the kitchen just now,\" she said.\n\"Are you quite sure it's all right? Does Alwynne _know_ she's engaged to\nyou?\"\n\nHe perpended.\n\n\"Well, frankly--I don't think she did quite take it in.\"\n\n\"Roger!\"\n\n\"But I'm buying the engagement ring to-morrow,\" he added hastily.\n\"That'll clear things up.\"\n\nElsbeth looked at him helplessly.\n\n\"Roger, either you're a genius or a lunatic. I'm not sure which--but, I\nthink, a lunatic.\"\n\n\"Oh, well! We shall know to-morrow,\" he observed consolingly. \"I shall\nturn up about eleven. Keep Alwynne for me, won't you?\"\n\nElsbeth struck her hands together.\n\n\"It's Clare Hartill's birthday! I'd almost forgotten her! Alwynne will\nbe engrossed. Oh, Roger! You've been telling me fairy tales. We've\nforgotten Clare Hartill!\"\n\nRoger picked up the scattered cards. With immense caution he poised a\ncouple, tent fashion, and builded about them, till a house was complete.\nHe added storey after storey, frowning and absorbed. At the sixth, the\nstructure collapsed. He looked up and met Elsbeth's eyes.\n\n\"People in card-houses shouldn't raise Cain. It's an expensive habit,\"\nhe remarked sententiously. \"Elsbeth, don't worry! But keep Alwynne till\nI come to-morrow, won't you?\"\n\n\"I'll try.\"\n\n\"Of course, if she's still in a temper----Hulloa!\"\n\nThe door had been softly opened. Alwynne, in her gay dressing-gown stood\non the threshold. Her hair was knotted on the top of her head, and small\ndamp curls strayed about her forehead. The folds of her wrapper, humped\nacross her arm, with elaborate care, hinted at the towels and sponges\nconcealed beneath. She looked, in spite of her bigness, like an\nextremely small child masquerading as a grown-up person.\n\nHer eyes sought her aunt's appealingly. Roger, she ignored.\n\n\"Elsbeth,\" she said meekly, \"please won't you come and tuck me up?\"\n\nShe disappeared again.\n\nElsbeth laughed as she rose.\n\n\"I knew she wouldn't be content. Isn't she a dear, Roger, for all her\nlittle ways?\"\n\n\"She's all right,\" said Roger, with immense conviction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n\nAlwynne was spending a contented morning. She had made her peace with\nElsbeth over-night, and at the ensuing breakfast had been something of a\nfeasted prodigal. Elsbeth had made no objection to her plans for the\nafternoon, but had suggested that, as Roger was coming to lunch, Alwynne\nmight take him for a walk in the morning. He was sure to arrive by\ntwelve. Alwynne, her head full of Clare's birthday and Clare's birthday\npresent, acquiesced graciously. Indeed, she was herself anxious to talk\nto him again, to show him how completely she and Elsbeth were in accord,\nto prove to him, once and for all, though with kindly firmness, how\nuncalled for his comments had been. She believed that they had not\nparted the best of friends last night.... A pity--Roger could be such a\ndear when he chose.... Yesterday afternoon, for instance.... She found\nherself blushing hotly, as she recalled the details of yesterday\nafternoon.\n\nHer thoughts were divided evenly between Roger and Clare as she sat at\nher work-table, running the last ribbon through the foamy laces and\nembroideries. She was proud of her work, and thrilled with pleasurable\nanticipations of Clare's comments. Clare would be pleased, wouldn't she?\n\nElsbeth, helping her to fold the dainty garment, and wondering wistfully\nif Alwynne would ever be found spending a tenth of the time and trouble\non her own trousseau that she lavished on presents for people who did\nnot appreciate them, was quite sure that Clare would be more than\npleased. She could not cloud Alwynne's happy face; but she hoped to\ngoodness that Roger would come soon.... She was sick of the word Clare.\n\nAlwynne despatched her parcel by messenger-boy. She would not trust it\nto the post--yet it must arrive before she did. Clare hated to be\nconfronted with you and your gift together. She hoped that Clare would\nnot be in a mood when gifts were anathema. You never knew with Clare.\n\nShe paid the boy with a bright shilling and a slice of inviolate company\ncake, and was guiltily endeavouring so to squeeze and compress its\ngirth, that Elsbeth would not notice the enlarged gap at tea-time, when\nRoger arrived.\n\nShe slid the tin hastily back into the cupboard.\n\n\"I won't shake hands,\" she said. \"But it's stickiness, not ill-feeling.\"\n\nRoger frowned aside the remark. He was looking excited, extremely\npleased with himself, yet a trifle worried. He had the air of a man who\nhad been priding himself on doing the right thing, and is suddenly\nstricken with doubt as to whether, after all, he had not made a mess of\nthe business. He confronted her.\n\n\"I expect I've got it wrong,\" he remarked, with gloomy triumph. \"I hate\ncoloured stones myself.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" demanded Alwynne.\n\n\"Which is it, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Which is what?\"\n\n\"Which is your favourite stone?\"\n\nAlwynne gazed at him blankly.\n\n\"What on earth----?\" she began.\n\nRoger frowned anew.\n\n\"Don't argue with me. Which is your favourite stone?\"\n\n\"I don't know--emeralds, I think.\"\n\nHe gave a sigh of relief, not entirely make-believe.\n\n\"Of course! I knew I was right. Elsbeth swore to pearls.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've always coveted her string. She's going to give it to me when\nI'm forty. I'd like to know what you're talking about, Roger, if you\ndon't mind?\"\n\n\"Why forty?\"\n\n\"Years of discretion! You are tidy and never lose anything once you're\nforty. But why? Were you having a bet?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\" Roger searched his pockets. \"Here, catch hold!\"\n\nHe had produced a small package, gay with sealing-wax and coloured\nstring. He handed it to her awkwardly, with immense detachment.\n\nShe opened it curiously.\n\nIn a little white kid case lay an emerald, round and shining like a\nsafety signal. It was set in silver, quaintly carven.\n\nAlwynne exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, Roger! How gorgeous! How perfectly ripping! Where did you pick it\nup? Was it awfully expensive?\"\n\nRoger had been beaming in a gratified fashion, but at her question his\njaw dropped.\n\n\"Well,\" he began. \"Well--I----\"\n\nHis expression struck her.\n\n\"Do you mind my asking? It's only because it is so exactly what I've\nalways longed to give Clare. I'm saving. I'm going to, some day. Clare\nloves emeralds.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Roger, with elaborate irony, \"you'd like to give her\nthis? Don't mind me.\"\n\nShe glanced up at him, startled, puzzled.\n\n\"This?\"\n\n\"It happens to be your engagement ring,\" he remarked offendedly.\n\nAlwynne began to laugh, but a trifle uncertainly. To laugh without\naccompaniment or encouragement is uneasy work, and Roger's face was\nentirely expressionless. She felt that her laughter was sounding\naffected, and ceased abruptly, her foot tapping the floor, a glint of\nannoyance in her eye.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" she attacked him.\n\n\"Your engagement ring, wasn't it?\" he said.\n\n\"Are you by any chance serious?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\" Roger's schoolboy awkwardness, due to his encounter with\nan unexpectedly facetious jeweller, was wearing off.\n\n\"_My_ engagement ring?\"\n\n\"We'll change it, of course,\" he said, with maddening politeness, \"if\nyou really prefer pearls.\"\n\n\"Presupposing an engagement?\" Alwynne was on her high horse.\n\n\"To me. That was the idea, I think. Elsbeth is delighted.\"\n\nAlwynne dismounted hastily again, though she kept a hand on the bridle.\n\n\"Roger--this is beyond a joke. What have you been saying to Elsbeth?\"\n\n\"Why, my dear,\" he said gently, \"very much what I told you yesterday\nafternoon.\"\n\nAlwynne grew scarlet.\n\n\"Roger--we were in fun yesterday. We were joking. I forget what it was\nall about. There was nothing to tell Elsbeth.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do forget,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. I have. I want to,\" she answered unsteadily. \"You know you weren't\nserious. Why, you were laughing at me--you know you were.\"\n\n\"Do you never laugh when you're serious?\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Alwynne earnestly.\n\n\"Well, then, we're like the Cheshire cat and dog. But I laugh when I'm\nmost amazingly serious sometimes, Alwynne. I was yesterday, and I think\nyou knew it.\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" said Alwynne stubbornly. \"We only just talked nonsense. All\nabout Holt Meadows--you know it was nonsense.\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" said Roger, with equal stubbornness.\n\n\"You did,\" said Alwynne.\n\n\"I didn't,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Oh, of course, if you're going to lose your temper----\" cried Alwynne.\n\nRoger shrugged his shoulders. It was deadlock.\n\nAlwynne looked at him. He was grave enough now.\n\n\"I didn't mean to be rude,\" she said unhappily.\n\n\"Didn't you?\" He was all polite surprise.\n\n\"I expect I was----\" she ventured.\n\n\"It all depends on what one's used to,\" he returned philosophically.\n\n\"Yes, I know I was. But you are so horrid to-day.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Roger stiffly.\n\nShe turned to him impulsively.\n\n\"Roger--I've missed you awfully since I came back. It was quite absurd,\nwhen I'd got Clare all to myself. But I did. It was so nice seeing you.\nI was simply miserable yesterday, and then you turned up and were\nperfectly sweet. It cheered me up. And then you turned horrid. All the\nevening you were horrid. And now you're horrid, quarrelling and arguing.\nWhy can't you be nice to me always?\"\n\nShe was very close to him. Her hand was on the arm of his chair. Her\nskirts swished against his knee.\n\n\"Alwynne, you're too illogical for a school-marm. Haven't you been\nbullying me since I came on account of yesterday?\"\n\n\"Roger,\" she said unsteadily, \"don't tease me. I do so want to be\nfriends with you.\"\n\nHe put his arms about her as she stood beside him, and looked up at her,\nwith laughing, tender eyes.\n\n\"And I do so want to marry you. Why not, Miss Le Creevy? _Let's be a\ncomfortable couple._\"\n\nShe struggled away from him.\n\n\"No, Roger! No. No. I don't want to get married. Why aren't you content\nto be friends, as we were at Dene? Friendship's a lot. If I can see you\nvery often, and write to you twice a week, and tell you everything--I\nshould be awfully content. Wouldn't you?\"\n\nHe looked at her with amusement.\n\n\"Your idea of friendship is pretty comprehensive. What's wrong with\ngetting married, Alwynne?\"\n\n\"Oh--I don't know.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with getting married, Alwynne?\"\n\n\"How can I get married,\" cried Alwynne, in sudden exasperation, \"when\nI'm not in love with you? You're silly sometimes, Roger.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're quite sure about it,\" he ventured cautiously.\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\nHe looked utterly unconvinced.\n\n\"Why, I've hardly ever even dreamed about you,\" she remonstrated. \"And I\nknow all your faults.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do, do you? Out with the list.\"\n\n\"It would take too long.\" Alwynne dimpled.\n\n\"Love must be blind--is that the idea? Couldn't that be got over? One\nuses blinkers, you know, in double harness. I never dream, Alwynne,\nnormally. Must I eat lobster salad every night?\"\n\n\"There--you see!\" Alwynne waved her hand complacently. \"You're just as\nbad. You couldn't talk like that if----\"\n\n\"If what?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\"\n\n\"If what?\"\n\nAlwynne looked at him.\n\n\"If what, Alwynne?\" Roger's tone was a little stern.\n\nShe had taken a rose from the bowl at her elbow, and was slowly pulling\noff the petals. Her eyes were on her work.\n\nHe waited.\n\nHer hands cupped the little pile of rose-leaves. She buried her face in\nthem--watching him an instant, through her fingers.\n\n\"They are very sweet, Roger--are they from home--from Dene, I mean?\nSmell!\"\n\nShe held out her hands to him.\n\nHe caught them in his own. The red petals fluttered noiselessly to the\nground.\n\n\"If what, Alwynne?\" he insisted.\n\n\"Oh, Roger! Do you really care--so much?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" he said soberly, \"so much.\"\n\nAlwynne looked up at him anxiously. She was very conscious of the big\nwarm hands that held hers so firmly. She wished that he would not look\nso intent and grave; he made her feel frightened and unhappy. No--not\nfrightened, exactly. There was something strong and serene about him,\nthat upheld her, even when she opposed him; but certainly, unhappy. She\nrealised suddenly how immensely she liked him--how entirely his nature\nsatisfied hers.\n\n\"Oh, Roger!\" she said wistfully. \"I do like you. It isn't that I\nwouldn't like to marry you.\"\n\nHis face lit up.\n\n\"Would--liking awfully--do, Roger? Would it be fair? Must one be in love\nlike a book?\"\n\nHis face relaxed.\n\n\"I shall be content,\" he said. Then, impetuously, \"Alwynne, I'll make\nyou so happy. You shall do--nearly everything--you want to. Alwynne, if\nyou only knew----\"\n\nShe stopped him hurriedly, pulling away her hands.\n\n\"Don't, Roger! Don't! I didn't mean that. I only meant I'd like to. But\nI can't, of course. Of course, I can't. There's Clare.\"\n\n\"Clare!\" His tone abolished Clare.\n\nAlwynne flushed.\n\n\"Why do you sneer at Clare? You always sneer. I won't have it.\"\n\nHer tone, in spite of her sudden anger, was unconsciously and comically\nproprietary. He repressed a smile as he answered her.\n\n\"All right, dear. But I wasn't sneering--not at Clare.\"\n\n\"At me, then?\"\n\n\"Not sneering--chuckling. My dear, what has Clare--oh, yes, she's your\ndearest friend--but what has any friend, any woman, got to say to us\ntwo? We're going to get married.\"\n\n\"We're not. It's no good, Roger.\" Alwynne spoke slowly and emphatically,\nas one explaining things to a foreigner. \"Why won't you understand?\nClare wants me. We've been friends for years.\"\n\n\"Two years!\" he interjected contemptuously.\n\n\"Well! You needn't talk! I've known you two months,\" she flashed out.\n\"Do you think I'm going to desert Clare for you, even if--even if----\"\nShe stopped suddenly.\n\nHe beamed.\n\n\"You do. Don't you, darling?\" he said.\n\n\"I don't. I don't. I don't want to. I mustn't. I don't know why I'm even\ntalking to you like this. It's ridiculous. Of course, there can never be\nany one but Clare.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is ridiculous,\" he said impatiently.\n\nShe faced him angrily.\n\n\"Yes, very ridiculous, isn't it? Not to leave a person in the lurch--a\nperson whom you love dearly, and who loves you. You can laugh. It's easy\nto laugh at women being friends. Men always do. They think it funny, to\npretend women are always catty, and spiteful, and disloyal to each\nother.\"\n\n\"I've never said so or thought so,\" said Roger.\n\n\"You have! You do! Look at the way you've talked about Clare. That looks\nas if you thought me loyal and a good friend, doesn't it? What would\nClare think of me--when I've let her be sure she can have me\nalways--when I've promised her----\"\n\n\"At nineteen! Miss Hartill's generous to allow you to sacrifice\nyourself----\"\n\n\"It's no sacrifice! Can't you understand that I care for her--awfully.\nWhy--I owe her everything. I was a silly, ignorant schoolgirl, and she\ntook me, and taught me--pictures, books, everything. She made me\nunderstand. Of course, I love my dear old Elsbeth--but Clare woke me\nup, Roger. You don't know how good she's been to me. I owe her--all my\nmind----\"\n\n\"And your peace?\" he asked significantly.\n\nShe softened.\n\n\"You know I'm grateful. I don't forget. But she's such a dreadfully\nlonely person. You've got The Dears, at least. She's queer. She can't\nhelp it. She doesn't make friends, though every one adores her. She's\nonly got me. She wants me. How could I go when she wants me--when she's\nso good to me?\"\n\n\"Is she?\" he said. \"Yesterday----\"\n\n\"I was a fool yesterday,\" said Alwynne quickly. \"Of course, I get on her\nnerves sometimes. But it's always my fault--honestly. You don't know\nwhat she's like, Roger, or you wouldn't say such things. I hate you to\nmisunderstand her. How could I care for her so, if she were what you and\nElsbeth think?\"\n\nHe looked at her innocent, anxious face, and sighed.\n\n\"All right, my dear. Stick to your Clare. As long as you're happy, I\nsuppose it's all right. Well, I'd better be off. Where's Elsbeth?\"\n\n\"Be off? Where?\" Alwynne looked startled.\n\n\"To pack my traps. I'm going home.\"\n\n\"Oh, Roger, you're not angry with me?\"\n\n\"I am, rather,\" he said. \"But you needn't mind me. You don't, do you?\"\n\nShe looked at him piteously.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" he said. He shook hands perfunctorily and turned away.\n\n\"You're angry--oh, you are!\" cried Alwynne, following him.\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"You can't pay Clare without robbing Roger. Don't worry, Alwynne.\"\n\n\"Are you really going?\" she said wistfully.\n\n\"Yes. Any message?\"\n\n\"You'll write to me, won't you?\"\n\n\"Good Lord, no!\" said Roger, with immense decision.\n\nAlwynne jumped. It was not the answer she had expected.\n\n\"But--but you must write to me,\" she stammered. \"How shall I know about\nyou, if you don't write to me?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\nA new idea struck Alwynne.\n\n\"D'you mean--you don't want to hear from me either?\" she asked\nincredulously.\n\n\"I think it would be better,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, Roger--why? Aren't you going to be friends?\"\n\nAlwynne was looking alarmed.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he began, with elaborate patience, \"if you could contrive,\nwithout straining yourself, to look at things from my point of view--for\na moment--only a moment?\"\n\n\"That's mean. You make me feel a beast.\"\n\n\"That won't hurt you----\"\n\n\"Roger!\"\n\n\"Alwynne?\"\n\n\"You're being very rude.\"\n\n\"You kick at the privileges of friendship already? I knew you would.\nLet's drop it, Alwynne. You've got your good lady: you're quite\nsatisfied. I've not got you: I'm not. So the best thing I can do is to\ngo back to Dene and forget about you.\"\n\n\"If you can,\" said Alwynne's widening, indignant eyes.\n\n\"After all,\" he said meditatively, \"you're a dear, but you aren't the\nonly woman in the world, are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Alwynne.\n\n\"I might go back to America,\" he said, \"for a time. I've heaps of\nfriends out there.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Alwynne.\n\n\"Yes, I shall get over it,\" he concluded comfortably. \"You mustn't\nworry, my child. Well, good-bye again--wish me good luck, Alwynne.\"\n\n\"Good luck,\" said Alwynne.\n\nHe took up his hat--looked at her--smiled a little, and walked to the\ndoor.\n\nBut before he could open it, he felt a touch on his arm.\n\n\"Roger,\" said a soft and wheedling voice, \"wouldn't you _like_ to write\nto me? Now and then, Roger?\"\n\nHe dissented with admirable gravity.\n\n\"All right! Don't then!\" cried Alwynne wrathfully. She turned her back\non him and sat down.\n\nThe luncheon-bell tinkled across the ensuing pause, like a peal of\npuckish laughter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n\nElsbeth's voice, raised tactfully at the further end of the passage,\nwarned them of her approach.\n\nSaid Alwynne over her shoulder--\n\n\"Anyhow, you must stay to lunch now, Elsbeth would be furious if you\nwent. She'll say I've driven you away or something. Unless you want to\nget me into another row?\"\n\nShe spoke ungraciously enough, for she disliked having to ask a favour\nof him at such a juncture; but she disliked even more the notion of a\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ lunch with Elsbeth. Elsbeth, by right of aunthood, would\nask questions, demand confession.... Elsbeth, she knew instinctively,\nwould be on Roger's side.... She told herself that she did not mind\nbeing bullied by Roger, because, after all, it was Roger's affair; but\nshe would not be otherwise interfered with.... Elsbeth had a way of\nputting you in the wrong.... She would rather not talk with Elsbeth\nuntil she had seen Clare.... Clare would fortify her.... If only Roger\nwould keep Elsbeth occupied till she got away to Clare....\n\n\"You must stay, you know,\" she repeated uneasily.\n\n\"You made me forget about lunch,\" he said cheerfully. \"Of course I must!\nYou know, you're a terror, Alwynne. I never know which makes me\nhungrier, a football match or an argument with you. I'm ravenous.\"\n\nAlwynne was speechless.\n\n\"Is no one coming in to lunch?\" asked Elsbeth, entering. She looked\nquickly from one to the other. Alwynne was at the glass, tidying her\nhair, and Roger seemed cheerful. Elsbeth smiled a significant smile:\nher eyebrows were question-marks.\n\nRoger shook his head, but not before Elsbeth had caught sight of the\nscattered rose and disarranged vases. She was instantly engaged in\nrestoring order, and missed the movement.\n\nSuddenly she exclaimed, and pounced on a small object lying on the\nfloor, half hidden in petals.\n\n\"Oh! Oh, how lovely! What an exquisite ring! Why, Roger--why,\nAlwynne--look! I might have trodden on it. How careless of you both.\"\n\nBut she beamed on them with immense satisfaction, as she held out the\nemerald ring.\n\n\"It's not mine,\" said Alwynne icily.\n\n\"Nothing to do with me,\" Roger assured her.\n\nElsbeth looked bewildered.\n\n\"One of you must have dropped it,\" she began.\n\n\"No!\" said Alwynne.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Roger.\n\nBut there was a glimmer of fun in his eye, that enlightened Elsbeth, or\nshe thought, at least, that it did.\n\n\"In my young days,\" she remarked severely, \"young people didn't leave a\nvaluable engagement ring lying about on the floor.\"\n\n\"A disengaged engagement ring,\" he corrected her sadly. \"At least, it's\ndisengaged at present.\"\n\n\"I think, Elsbeth,\" said Alwynne firmly, \"that the lunch must be getting\ncold.\" And preceded them in all dignity to the dining-room.\n\nAlwynne found the meal a trying one. Roger was talkative, and Elsbeth,\nthough obviously puzzled, was too much occupied with him, to be critical\nof her niece. Alwynne was divided between gratitude to Roger for\nrelieving the situation, and pique that he could be equal to so doing. A\nman in his position should be far too crushed by disappointment for\nsocial amenities. She would have been genuinely distressed, yet\nundeniably gratified, if his appetite had failed him; but she noticed\nthat he was able to eat a hearty meal. He could laugh, too, with\nElsbeth, and make ridiculous jokes, and draw Alwynne, silent and\nunwilling, into the conversation. He seemed to have no objection to\ncatching her eye, though she found it difficult to meet his. He was a\nqueer man.... She supposed he wasn't very much in love with her, really,\nthat was the truth of it.... She found the idea depressing. She wondered\nif he were really going back to Dene at once, and was relieved to hear\nher aunt challenging his decision. Elsbeth was expostulating. She had\nplans for the next day ... there was a concert that evening.... Roger\nappeared to waver. Alwynne, contemptuous that he could be so easily\nturned, annoyed that Elsbeth should sway him where she herself had\nfailed, was yet conscious of a feeling of relief. At least she should\nsee him again, if only to quarrel with him.... She was due to supper\nwith Clare as well as tea, though she had not told Elsbeth so.... It\nwould be quite simple--she would run round to Clare at once, and spend a\nlong afternoon, and get back for another peep at Roger in the\nevening.... Clare wouldn't mind....\n\nShe hesitated. Clare would be rather surprised if she didn't stay....\nShe had never been known to curtail a visit to Clare before.... But she\nwould explain things to her.... Clare would be as sorry for Roger as she\nherself ... for, of course, she must tell Clare all about it.... She\nhoped Clare would not say she had been flirting.... But she must make\nher at least understand what a dear Roger was.... She should like Clare\nto appreciate Roger ... she was afraid she would never be able to make\nRoger appreciate Clare.... It was a great pity!... If it had not been\nfor Roger's unlucky prejudice, she might have introduced them to each\nother, and it would have all been so jolly.... She would have loved to\nshow Clare to Roger, if Clare had been in a good mood, and had worn her\nnew peacock-coloured frock and had looked and been as adorable as she\nsometimes could be. They might have gone to-day--and now Roger had\nspoiled everything.... But at least he was not going till to-morrow....\nShe would slip away at once while he and Elsbeth were talking--she would\nbe back all the sooner....\n\nShe left the pair at their coffee, and hurried to her room to put on her\nnew coat and skirt and her prettiest hat. It was Clare's birthday ...\nand Clare liked her to be fine.... She wondered, with a little skip of\nexcitement, if Clare had got her parcel yet?\n\nShe was no sooner gone than Roger turned to Elsbeth, his laughing manner\ndropped from him like a mask.\n\n\"It's all off, Elsbeth,\" he said. \"You were right. It's that woman.\nShe's infatuated.\"\n\nThe pleasure died out of Elsbeth's face.\n\n\"I was afraid so,\" she said. \"I saw something had happened. But you were\nso comical, I couldn't be sure.\"\n\n\"I didn't want an explanation just then----\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" she interpolated hastily.\n\n\"But I think I'll go straight back to Dene. Have you a time-table?\"\n\n\"Have you quarrelled badly?\"\n\n\"Not exactly! Alwynne's rather annoyed with me, though.\"\n\n\"Annoyed? With you?\"\n\n\"Well, you see,\" he explained, with a touch of amusement, \"I think she\nrather wants to retain me as a tame cat----\"\n\n\"Oh, but Alwynne's not like that,\" Elsbeth protested.\n\n\"Don't you think every woman is, if she gets the chance? She has to\nkow-tow to the Hartill woman, and it would be a relief to have some one\nto do the same to her--as well as an amusement. But she's had to\nunderstand that I won't be her friend's whipping-boy. I decline the\npost.\"\n\n\"Oh,--well, if you put it that way--but it's hardly fair to Alwynne. Of\ncourse, you're angry and disappointed----\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" he protested heatedly.\n\n\"Oh, but you are. Don't pretend you're not human. I don't blame you; I'm\nangry too. But you must be fair. Alwynne's motives are obvious enough.\nThere's no cat-and-mouse business about it. She simply can't bear the\nidea of losing you.\"\n\n\"Yet she won't marry me.\"\n\n\"She would, if it weren't for Clare. Didn't you get that impression?\nRoger, if you really care, wait here a little longer. Stay with us. Let\nher have a chance of contrasting you with Clare Hartill.\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" he said obstinately.\n\n\"You care more for your own dignity than for Alwynne, I think,\" said\nElsbeth, in her lowest voice.\n\n\"Cousin Elsbeth, I care more for Alwynne than for anything else in the\nworld. You know that. Also, though you'll call me a conceited ass, I\nbelieve I know your ewe-lamb ten thousand times better than you do. And\nI've simply got to sit tight for a bit. The less she sees of me at\npresent, the more she'll think of me--in two senses. If I can make her\nmiss me, it'll be a profitable exile. Oh, you dear, worried woman,\" he\ncried, laughing at her intent face, \"do you think I want to go away from\nAlwynne? Nevertheless--where's the time-table?\"\n\nShe rose and fetched it, and gave it him, without a word.\n\nHe ran his finger down the page.\n\n\"There's a four o'clock,\" he announced.\n\n\"If only I could do something,\" mused Elsbeth.\n\nHe smiled at her gratefully.\n\n\"You're a pretty staunch friend,\" he said. \"What more can one ask?\"\n\n\"Oh, but I ought to think of something,\" she said impatiently. \"I sit\nhere and let you go--I see two people's lives being spoiled--for the\nwant of a----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That's it! What? What can I do? Nothing, nothing, nothing. Oh, Roger,\nit's hard. It's very hard to see people you love unhappy, and not to be\nable to help them. It's the hardest thing I know. It would be such\nhappiness to be allowed to bear things for them. But to watch.... It's\nharder for us than for men, you know--we're such born meddlers. We think\nit's our mission to put things to rights.\"\n\n\"When we've made a mess of 'em. I'm not sure that it isn't!\"\n\n\"I've got to do something,\" she went on, without heeding him. \"There\nyou'll be at Dene, miserable--you will be miserable, Roger?\" she\ninterrupted herself, with a faint twinkle.\n\n\"Don't you worry,\" he reassured her. \"It was bad enough when she left.\nShe's managed to make every nook and corner of the place remind one of\nher. I don't know how she does it. Oh, it will be rotten, all right.\"\n\n\"Then there will be Alwynne here,\" she continued, \"pretending she\ndoesn't care. Working herself into a fever each time Clare is unkind to\nher--and pretending she doesn't care. Watching the posts for a letter\nfrom you--I know her--and pretending she doesn't care. Thoroughly\nmiserable, and quite satisfied that I see nothing, as long as she laughs\nand jokes at meals. Oh, life's a comedy,\" cried Elsbeth. \"You young folk\nhave your troubles, and think we are too old and blind to see them; and\nwe old folk have our troubles, and know you are too young and blind to\nsee them. Yes, Roger--I'm having a grumble, and it's doing me good. One\nsuffers vicariously as one gets older, but one suffers just the same.\nYou children forget that.\"\n\n\"Do we?\" he said gently. \"I won't again--we won't, later on,\nElsbeth--Alwynne and I.\"\n\n\"I want you two to be happy,\" she cried piteously. \"I want it so. Oh,\nRoger, what can I do?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\nShe was silenced. But he was touched and a little amused to see how\nentirely she was unconvinced. He admired her persistence, and wondered\nif she had fought as vehemently for her own happiness, as she now fought\nfor Alwynne's. Failure was instinct in her, in her faded colouring and\neager, unassured manner. He thought it probable that the memory of\nfailure was spurring her now.\n\nHe roused her gently.\n\n\"Elsbeth! It's past three o'clock. Will you come and see me off? I must\ngo back to the White Horse for my bag first. Shall I call for you? I\nshan't be more than twenty minutes.\"\n\nShe nodded assent and promised to be ready.\n\nLeft to herself, she went to her room and dressed with mechanical care.\nHer mind tossed the while like an oarless boat in the sea of her\nrestless thoughts.\n\nWhat could she do? Wait--wait and hope, and watch things go wrong....\nRoger was in love now, and prepared to be patient; but Roger was only a\nman.... He would get over it in time; and Alwynne, finally released from\nClare's influence--that, too, surely, was only a question of time--would\nfind out what she had lost.... She understood Alwynne well enough to\nknow that if she cared, however unconsciously, for Roger, she would\nnever be content to attach herself to any later comer.... Alwynne was\nterribly tenacious. So she, too, would waste and spoil her life; and for\nthe sake of an infatuation, a piece of girlish quixotry.... It was\ncriminal of Clare Hartill to allow it.... She supposed that the\nsituation amused Clare; at least, if Alwynne's version had allowed her\nto guess it.... She wondered exactly how much Alwynne would tell\nClare....\n\nSuddenly and wonderfully she was illumined by an idea.\n\nRoger, returning punctually with his bag, found Elsbeth awaiting him on\nthe step, in calling costume, pulling and patting at a new pair of\ngloves with extraordinary energy. Her cheeks were bright; she had the\nair of frightened bravery of a cornered sheep.\n\n\"Come away quickly, Roger,\" she whispered, with a glance at the windows.\n\"I don't want Alwynne to catch me. I can't come with you to the station,\nRoger. I'm going to see Clare Hartill.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n\nAlwynne, for all her eagerness, took more than her usual breathless ten\nminutes in reaching Clare Hartill's flat. Underneath her pleasure at\nseeing Clare again ran a little current of uneasiness. There was so much\nto be told, not only in deference to the intimacy of their relationship,\nbut in order to procure the proof that had never before seemed\nnecessary, that Roger's, and incidentally Elsbeth's, view of that\nrelationship was wrong.... Clare, of course, was reserved,\nundemonstrative, not, Alwynne was prepared to admit, so kindly or\nconsiderate a companion as--well, as Roger.... But why it should\ntherefore follow that Roger loved her better, and was more\nworthy--preposterous word--of her own love, Alwynne could not see....\nClare Hartill cared for her, had told her so, had--had not as yet proved\nit, because there had been no need of proof.... Alwynne could love for\ntwo.... But to-day she felt only an aching desire that Clare should\nrealise the importance of what she had just done; should reward her\nsacrifice with little softenings and intimacies, some such signs as she\nhad shown her in the earlier days of their friendship, of affection and\nsympathy.... She did not ask much, she told herself; if Clare were only\na little kind, she should not miss Roger. Even as she so decided, her\ncheek flushing at the idea of Clare's kindness, at the possibility of a\nreturn to their earlier relationship, she saw suddenly, with flashlight\ndistinctness, how much, even then, she should miss Roger, how great her\nsacrifice would still be.... She saw, as in a vision, the man and woman\ndrowning in waste seas, and she herself at rescue work with room for one\nand one only in the boat beside her.... She felt herself torn by the\nagony of choice, knowing the while, that a year ago it had not been so;\nthat a year ago she would have outstretched arms for Clare alone; that\neven now, Elsbeth, The Dears, all alike might drown in that dream sea,\nso long as Clare were saved.... She acknowledged, she exulted in the\nnarrowness of her affection.... Clare before the world! But Clare before\nRoger? Clare safe and Roger drowning? She chuckled as it occurred to her\nthat Roger would certainly be able to swim.... Yes, he would swim\ncomfortably alongside and spare her the fantastic trouble of a\nchoice.... Blessed old Roger!\n\nAs she passed the little kiosk at the corner of Friar's Lane, where a\nred-haired girl sat behind branches of white and mauve lilac, and\nhigh-piled mounds of violets, she hesitated and turned back. It was a\nbreaking of unwritten rules, and Clare would give her no thanks, but\nto-day at least she would not scold.... She would say nothing, but how\nbig her dear eyes would grow at sight of that armful of scented colour!\nShe bought lavishly, and forgot to stay for change, for she was\npicturing her own arrival as she hurried on: the open door; the\npell-mell of flowers and sunlight; Clare's smile; Clare's kiss. In spite\nof moods Clare could not do without her! She tore up the stairs and\npealed the bell, with never another thought of Roger.\n\nClare was at her writing-table and had but a bare nod for Alwynne, as\nshe stood in the doorway, flushed, smiling, expectant. The girl was\naccustomed to finding her preoccupied; there was a time, indeed, when\nthere had been subtle flattery in the cavalier welcome, when the lack of\nceremony had seemed but a proof of intimacy, and she would bide her time\nhappily enough, exploring book-shelves, darning stockings, tiptoeing\nfrom parlour to pantry to refill vases and valet neglected plants, or,\ncurled in the big arm-chair, would sketch upon imaginary canvases\nClare's profile, dark against the sun-filled window, or stare\nhalf-hypnotised, at the twinkling diamond on her finger. But to-day, for\nthe first time, Clare's reception of her jarred.\n\nShe sat down quietly, the flowers in a heap at her feet, her excitement\nsubsiding and leaving her jaded and sorehearted. She felt herself\ndisregarded, reduced to the level of an importunate schoolgirl.... She\nwondered how much longer Clare intended to write, and told herself, with\na little, petulant shrug, that for two pins she would surprise Clare,\nwrench away her pen, take her by the shoulders and anger her into\nattention. Roger was right.... One could be too meek.... She rose with a\nlittle quiver of excitement, her irrepressible phantasy limning with\nlightning speed an imaginary Clare--a Clare beleaguered, with barriers\ndown, a Clare with wide maternal arms, enclosing, comforting,\nsufficing....\n\nThe real Clare shifted in her seat and Alwynne sank back again. No, that\nwas not the way to take Clare.... One must be patient, only patient,\nlike Roger.... Clare would give all one needed, that was sure, but in\nher own time, her own way.... One must be patient....\n\nShe loosed her coat.... How close the room was.... She would have liked\nto fling open the window, but Clare always protested.... She heard\nElsbeth's voice: \"Fresh air? Her idea of fresh air is an electric\nfan.\" ... Queer, how those two jarred! But Elsbeth was not just....\n\nHer head throbbed. Listlessly she picked up a spray of lilac and crushed\nit against her face. It was deliciously cool.... She supposed that the\nlilacs were out by now at Dene....\n\nTic, tac! Tic, tac! The tick of the clock would not keep time with the\nscratch of Clare's pen.... How stupid! Stupid, stu--pid, stu--pid,\nstu----\n\n\"Clare!\" she cried desperately, \"won't you even talk to me?\"\n\nClare wrote on for a moment as if she had not heard her, finished her\nletter, blotted it, stamped and addressed the cover and wiped her pen\ndeliberately; then she rose, smiling a little. She had been perfectly\nconscious of Alwynne's unrest.\n\n\"What is it?\" she said. Alwynne flushed and gathered up her flowers.\n\n\"It's your birthday,\" she apologised. \"Look, Clare, aren't they\ndarlings? I know you hate the school fusses, but your own birthday is\nimportant. Must you go on writing? It ought to be a holiday. May I get\nvases? Clare, I've such heaps to tell you, heaps and heaps, only I can't\nif you stand and look at me from such a long way off. Won't you sit down\nand smell your lilacs and let me talk to you comfortably?\"\n\nWith enormous daring she put her arm round Clare and drew her on to the\nsofa. Clare made no resistance, but she sat stiffly, unsupported, still\nsmiling, her eyes glittering oddly. But the acquiescence was enough for\nAlwynne and she slid to the ground and sat there sorting her flowers,\nher face level with Clare's knee, radiant and fearless again.\n\n\"I wonder what you will say? It's about Roger.\"\n\nClare raised her eyebrows.\n\n\"Oh, Clare, don't you know? I wrote such a lot about him from Dene.\"\n\n\"I am to remember every detail of your epistles?\"\n\nAlwynne looked up quaintly--\n\n\"I suppose there is a good deal to wade through. There always seems so\nmuch to say to you. Do you really mind?\"\n\n\"You remind me that I've letters to finish.\"\n\nAlwynne looked at the clock in sudden alarm.\n\n\"Am I awfully early? You did expect me to tea?\"\n\n\"And you're never on the late side, are you?\" Clare was still smiling,\nbut her tone stung.\n\nAlwynne got up quickly.\n\n\"I'm very sorry. Don't bother about me. I'll arrange these things while\nyou finish. I didn't know you were really busy.\"\n\nClare put out her hand to the table behind her.\n\n\"I'm not busy. It seems one mayn't tease you since you've stayed at\nDene.\"\n\nAlwynne's eyes flashed.\n\n\"That's not fair. It's only that--that sometimes now you tease with\nneedles--you used to tease with straws.\"\n\n\"So I had better not tease at all?\"\n\n\"You know I don't mean that.\"\n\nClare lifted an opened parcel from the table. Alwynne recognised it and\nbeamed. So Clare was pleased!\n\n\"If I tease with needles,\" she smoothed the paper and began to\nstraighten the little heap of knotted string, \"it's because you annoy me\nso often. Why did you send me this, Alwynne?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"It was your birthday.\"\n\n\"I hate birthdays.\"\n\n\"I know.\" She spoke flatly, a lump in her throat. She might have known\nand saved herself her trouble and her pleasure.... She thought of the\nweeks of careful work and her delight in it; of the little sacrifices;\nthe early rising; the walks with Roger curtailed and foregone....\nEverybody had admired it, even Elsbeth had been sure that Clare would be\ncharmed.... But Clare was angry.... Perhaps it was only that Clare did\nnot understand.... She roused herself.\n\n\"Clare, it's different. Don't you remember?\"\n\nClare gave no sign. She had disentangled the string and was retying it\nwith elaborate care. Alwynne spoke with eyes fixed upon the dexterous\nfingers--\n\n\"You challenged me, don't you remember, Clare? When Marion showed us the\nthings she was making for her sister's trousseau? And you said, would I\never have the patience, let alone my clumsy fingers? And I said I could,\nand you said you would wear all I made. And you did laugh at me so. So I\nthought I'd surprise you, and Elsbeth taught me the pillow-lace, and I\nwas frightfully careful. It's taken months and months, and you love\nlace, and oh, Clare! I thought you would be a little bit pleased.\"\n\nHer lip quivered; she was very childlike in her eagerness and\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Did you think I should wear it?\"\n\nAlwynne dimpled.\n\n\"It's your size, Clare. Wouldn't you just try it?\"\n\nClare looked at her inscrutably.\n\n\"You've taken great pains,\" she said. \"I've been pleased to see it. But\nyou've shown it to me and I've told you that you've learned to work\nwell, so it has fulfilled its purpose, hasn't it? And now you'd better\ntake it back with you. I'm sure you will be able to use it.\"\n\nShe held out the neatly fastened package.\n\nAlwynne's face hardened. She put her hands behind her back.\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind,\" she said.\n\nClare did not seem ruffled.\n\n\"Of course you will. And you'll look very pretty in it.\" She smiled\namiably.\n\nBut Alwynne's face did not relax.\n\n\"I won't take it back. I gave it to you. I made it to give you pleasure.\nIf you don't want it, burn it, give it to your maid, throw it away. Do\nyou think I care what becomes of it? But I won't take it back. That is\nan insult. You say that to hurt me.\"\n\n\"You'll take it back because I wish you to.\"\n\n\"I won't. You shouldn't wish me to.\"\n\n\"You know I dislike presents.\"\n\n\"I never labelled it a present in my mind. You talk as if we were\nstrangers.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, then,\" murmured Clare, still smiling, \"I dislike the hint that\nyou consider my wardrobe inadequate.\"\n\nAlwynne caught her breath. For the last ten minutes she had been growing\nangry, not in her usual summer-tempest fashion, but with a slow, cold\nanger that was pain. She felt Clare's attitude an indelicacy--the\ndiscussion a degradation. She sickened at its pettiness. She seemed to\nbe defending, not herself, but some shrinking, weaponless creature, from\nattack and outrage.... The fight had been sudden, desperate; but at\nClare's last sentence she knew herself vanquished, knew that the first\nlove of her life had been most mortally wounded.\n\nShe turned blindly. She had no tears, no regret: her sensations were\npurely physical. She was numbed, breathless, choking, conscious only of\nan overpowering desire for fresh air, for escape into the open. But\nfirst she must say good-bye, head erect, betraying nothing ... say\ngood-bye to the dark figure that was no longer Clare.... A sentence from\na child's book danced through her mind in endless repetition, _They\nrubbed her eyes with the ointment, and she saw it was only a stock._ Of\ncourse! And now she must go away quickly.... She should choke if she\ncould not get into the air....\n\nShe heard her own voice, flat and tiny--\n\n\"Have you finished with me? May I go now?\"\n\nClare's laugh was quite unforced.\n\n\"You're not to go yet!\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes--I think so. May I go now, please?\"\n\nShe had retreated to the door and clung to the handle looking back with\nblank eyes.\n\n\"But, you foolish child, you've had no tea. Why are you running away?\nAre you going to spoil my afternoon?\"\n\nShe lied blunderingly, mad to escape.\n\n\"But I told you I couldn't stay long. Because--because of Elsbeth. She's\nto meet me. I only ran up for a minute. Really, I have to go.\" She made\na tremendous effort: \"I--I can come back later.\"\n\nClare shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Oh, very well. Will you come to supper?\"\n\nAlwynne forced a smile.\n\n\"Yes.\" She crossed the threshold, Clare watching from the doorway.\n\n\"I shall wait for you, we'll have a lazy evening. Supper at eight.\"\n\nThere was no answer. Alwynne was stumbling down into the darkness of the\nstairs and did not seem to hear. Clare turned back into her flat,\nhesitated uneasily, and came out again. She leaned far over the\nbalustrade, peering down.\n\n\"Alwynne!\" she cried. \"Alwynne! Wait a moment, Alwynne!\"\n\nBut Alwynne was gone, gone beyond recall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\n\nAlwynne fled down Friar's Lane in amazement, conscious only of the need\nof escape. She had heard the outer door of the flat close behind her,\nyet she felt herself pursued. Clare's voice rang in her ears. Momently\nshe awaited the touch of Clare's hand upon her shoulder. She felt\nherself exhausted; knew that, once overtaken, she would be powerless to\nresist; that she would be led back; would submit to reconciliation and\ncaresses. And yet she was sure that she would never willingly see Clare\nagain. She was free, and her terror of recapture taught her what liberty\nmeant to her. There was the whole world before her, and Elsbeth--and\nRoger.... She must find Roger.... She was capable of no clear thought,\nbut very sure that with him was safety.\n\nShe hurried along in the shadow of the overhanging lilac-hedge, ears\na-prick, eyes glancing to right and left. Oblivious of probabilities she\nsaw Clare in every passer-by. At the turn of the blind lane she ran into\na woman, walking towards her. She bit back a cry.\n\nBut it was only Elsbeth--Elsbeth in her Sunday gown, very determined,\ngripping her card-case as if it were a dagger. She spoke between relief\nand distress.\n\n\"Alwynne! Why did you disappear? Where have you been?\"\n\n\"With Clare.\"\n\n\"It was more than rude. You could surely have foregone one afternoon. No\none to see Roger off! After all his kindness to you at Dene!\"\n\n\"See Roger off?\"\n\nElsbeth was pleased to see her concern.\n\n\"I should have gone myself, of course, but he would not allow it. The\nheat--as I have to pay a call. So he saw me on my way and then went off\nby himself, poor Roger!\"\n\n\"Where is he going? Why is he going?\"\n\n\"Back to Dene. The four-five. I am afraid, Alwynne, he has been hurt and\nupset. Alwynne!\"\n\nBut Alwynne, tugging at her watch-chain, was already running down the\nroad with undignified speed. The four-five! Another ten minutes ... no,\nnine and a half.... Cutting through the gardens she might do it yet....\nShe prayed for her watch to be fast--the train late. She ran steadily,\ndoggedly, oblivious of the passers-by, oblivious of heat and dust and\nchoking breathlessness, of everything but the idea that Roger was\ndeserting her.\n\nAs she bent round the sweep of the station yard past the shelter with\nits nodding cabmen, and ran down the little wall-flower-bordered asphalt\npath, she heard the engine's valedictory puff. The platform was noisy\nand crowded, alive with shouting porters, crates of poultry and burdened\nwomen, but at the upper end was Roger, his foot on the step of the\ncarriage, obviously bribing a guard.\n\nShe pushed past the outraged ticket collector, and darted up the\nplatform.\n\nRoger had disappeared when she reached the door of his compartment, and\nthe whistle had sounded, but the door was still a-swing. The train began\nto move as she scrambled in. The door banged upon their privacy.\n\n\"Roger!\" cried Alwynne. \"Roger!\"\n\nShe was shaking with breathlessness and relief.\n\n\"You were right. I was wrong. It's you I want. I will do everything you\nwant, always. I've been simply miserable. Oh, Roger--be good to me.\"\n\nAnd for the rest of his life Roger was good to her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n\nClare had paused a moment, half expecting Alwynne to return; but it was\ndraughty on the landing and she did not wait long. Silly of Alwynne to\ndash off like that.... She had wanted to discuss Miss Marsham's letter\nwith her before writing her answer.... Not that she was really\nundecided, of course.... The offer was an excellent one no doubt, and it\nwas fitting that it should have been made.... But to accept the head\nmistress-ship was another matter.... Life was pleasant enough as it\nwas.... She had plenty of money and Alwynne was hobby enough.... She\nwondered what Alwynne would say to it ... urge her to accept,\nprobably.... Alwynne was so terribly energetic.... Well, she would let\nAlwynne talk ... (she picked up her pen) and when she had expended\nherself, Clare would produce her already written refusal.... Alwynne\nwould pout and be annoyed.... Alwynne hated being made to look a\nfool.... Clare laughed as she bent over her letter.\n\nShe had achieved preliminary compliments and was hesitating as to how\nshe should continue, when a violent rat-tat, hushing immediately to a\ntremulous tat-a-tat-tat, as if the success of the attack upon Clare's\ndoor had proved a little startling to the knocker, announced a visitor,\nand to their mutual astonishment, Elsbeth Loveday fluttered into the\nroom. Though Elsbeth's na\u00c3\u00afve amazement at herself and her own courage\nwas more apparent, it was scarcely greater than Clare's politely veiled\nsurprise at the invasion, for since Alwynne's attempts to reconcile the\noil and water of their reluctant personalities had ceased with her\nabsence, there had been practically no intercourse between them. With a\ncrooked smile for her first fleeting conviction of the imminence of a\nchurch bazaar or Sunday-school treat on gargantuan lines, Clare applied\nherself to the preparation of Elsbeth's tea, in no great hurry for the\ndisclosure of the visit's object, but already slightly amused at her\nvisitor's unease, and foreseeing a whimsical half-hour in watching her\npant and stumble, unassisted, to her point.\n\nElsbeth was dimly aware of her hostess's attitude, and not a little\nnettled by it. She waved away cake and toast with a vague idea of\nbreaking no bread in the enemy's house, but she was not the woman to\nresist tea, though Hecate's self brewed it. Fortified, she returned the\nempty cup; readjusted her veil, and opened fire.\n\n\"My dear Miss Hartill,\" she began, a shade too cordially, \"I've come\nround--I do hope you're not too busy; I know how occupied you always\nare.\"\n\nClare was not at all busy; entirely at Miss Loveday's service.\n\n\"Ah, well, I confess I came round in the hope of finding you alone--in\nthe hope of a quiet chat----\"\n\nClare was expecting no visitors. But would not Miss Loveday take another\ncup of tea?\n\n\"Oh no, thank you. Though I enjoyed my cup immensely--delicious flavour.\nChina, isn't it? Alwynne always quotes your tea. Poor Alwynne--she can't\nconvert me. I've always drunk the other, you know. Not but that China\ntea is to be preferred for those who like it, of course. An acquired\ntaste, perhaps--at least----\" She finished with an indistinct murmur\nuncomfortably aware that she had not been particularly lucid in her\ncompliments to Clare's tea.\n\nMight Clare order a cup of Indian tea to be made for Miss Loveday? It\nwould be no trouble; her maid drank it, she believed.\n\n\"Oh, please don't. I shouldn't dream----You know, I didn't originally\nintend to come to tea. But you are so very kind. I am sure you are\nwondering what brings me.\"\n\nClare disclaimed civilly.\n\n\"Well, to tell you the truth--I am afraid you will think me extremely\nroundabout, Miss Hartill----\"\n\nClare's mouth twitched.\n\n\"But it is not an easy subject to begin. I'm somewhat worried about\nAlwynne----\"\n\n\"Again?\" Clare had stiffened, but Elsbeth was too nervous to be\nobservant.\n\n\"Oh, not her health. She is splendidly well again--Dene did wonders.\"\nClare found Elsbeth's quick little unexplained smile irritating. \"No,\nthis is--well, it certainly has something to do with Dene, too!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Clare.\n\nElsbeth continued, delicately tactless: she was always at her worst with\nher former pupil.\n\n\"I daresay you are surprised that I consult you, for we need not\npretend, need we, that we have ever quite agreed over Alwynne? You, I\nknow, consider me old-fashioned----\" She paused a moment for a\ndisclaimer, but Clare was merely attentive. With a little less suavity\nshe resumed: \"And of course I've always thought that you----But that,\nafter all, has nothing to do with the matter.\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" said Clare.\n\n\"Exactly. But knowing that you are fond of Alwynne, and realising your\ngreat, your very great, influence with her, I felt--indeed we both\nfelt--that if you once realised----\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\"Roger. Mr. Lumsden.\"\n\n\"Oh, the gardener at Dene.\"\n\n\"My cousin, Miss Hartill.\"\n\n\"Oh. Oh, really. But what has he to do with Alwynne?\"\n\n\"My dear, he wants to marry her. Didn't she tell you?\" Elsbeth had the\nsatisfaction of seeing Clare look startled. \"Now I was sure Alwynne had\nconfided the matter to you. Hasn't she just been here? That is really\nwhy I came. I was so afraid that you, with the best of motives, of\ncourse, might incline her to refuse him. And you know, Miss Hartill, she\nmustn't. The very man for Alwynne? He suits her in every way. Devoted to\nher, of course, but not in the least weak with her, and you know I\nalways say that Alwynne needs a firm hand. And between ourselves, though\nI am the last person to consider such a thing, he is an extremely good\nmatch. I can't tell you, Miss Hartill, the joy it was to me, the\nengagement. I had been anxious--I quite foresaw that Alwynne would be\ndifficult, though I am convinced she is attached to him--underneath, you\nknow. So I made up my mind to come to you. I said to myself: 'I am\nsure--I am quite sure--Miss Hartill would not misunderstand the\nsituation. I am quite sure Miss Hartill would not intend to stand in the\nchild's light. She is far too fond of Alwynne to allow her personal\nfeelings----' After all, feminine friendship is all very well, very\ndelightful, of course, and I am only too sensible of your goodness to\nAlwynne--and taking her to Italy too--but when it is a question of\nMarriage--oh, Miss Hartill, surely you see what I mean?\"\n\nClare frowned.\n\n\"I think so. The gard----This Mr. Lumpkin----\"\n\n\"Lumsden.\"\n\n\"Of course. I was confusing him----Mr. Lumsden has proposed to Alwynne.\nShe has refused him, and you now wish for my help in coercing her into\nan apparently distasteful engagement?\"\n\n\"Oh no, Miss Hartill! No question of coercion. I think there is no\npossible doubt that she is fond of him, and if it were not for\nyou----But Alwynne is so quixotic.\"\n\nClare lifted her eyebrows, politely blank.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Hartill--why beat about the bush? You know your influence with\nAlwynne. It is very difficult for me to talk to you. Please believe that\nI intend nothing personal--but Alwynne is so swayed by you, so entirely\nunder your thumb; you know what a loyal, affectionate child she is, and\nas far as I can gather from what Roger let fall--for she is in one of\nher moods and will not confide in me--she considers herself bound to you\nby--by the terms of your friendship. All she would say to Roger was,\n'Clare comes first. Clare must come first'--which, of course, is\nperfectly ridiculous.\"\n\nClare reddened.\n\n\"You mean that I, or you, for that matter, who have known Alwynne for\nyears, must step aside, must dutifully foster this liking for a\ncomparative stranger.\"\n\nElsbeth smiled.\n\n\"Well, naturally. He's a man.\"\n\n\"I am sorry I can't agree. Alwynne is a free agent. If she prefers my\nfriendship to Mr. Lumsden's adorations----\"\n\n\"But I've told you already, it's a question of Marriage, Miss Hartill.\nSurely you see the difference? How can you weigh the most intimate, the\nmost ideal friendship against the chance of getting married?\" Elsbeth\nwas wholly in earnest.\n\nClare mounted her high horse.\n\n\"I can--I do. There are better things in life than marriage.\"\n\n\"For the average woman? Do you sincerely say so? The brilliant\nwoman--the rich woman--I don't count them, and there are other\nexceptions, of course; but when her youth is over, what is the average\nsingle woman? A derelict, drifting aimlessly on the high seas of life.\nOh--I'm not very clear; it's easy to make fun of me; but I know what I\nmean and so do you. We're not children. We both know that an unmated\nwoman--she's a failure--she's unfulfilled.\"\n\nClare was elaborately bored.\n\n\"Really, Miss Loveday, the subject does not interest me.\"\n\n\"It must, for Alwynne's sake. Don't you realise your enormous\nresponsibility? Don't you realise that when you keep Alwynne entangled\nin your apron strings, blind to other interests, when you cram her with\npoetry and emotional literature, when you allow her to attach herself\npassionately to you, you are feeding, and at the same time deflecting\nfrom its natural channel, the strongest impulse of her life--of any\ngirl's life? Alwynne needs a good concrete husband to love, not a\nfantastic ideal that she calls friendship and clothes in your face and\nfigure. You are doing her a deep injury, Miss Hartill--unconsciously, I\nknow, or I should not be here--but doing it, none the less. If you will\nconsider her happiness----\"\n\nClare broke in angrily--\n\n\"I do consider her happiness. Alwynne tells you that I am essential to\nher happiness.\"\n\n\"She may believe so. But she's not happy. She has not been happy for a\nlong time. But she believes herself to be so, I grant you that. But\nconsider the future. Shall she never break away? Shall she oscillate\nindefinitely between you and me, spend her whole youth in sustaining two\nold maids? Oh, Miss Hartill, she must have her chance. We must give her\nwhat we've missed ourselves.\"\n\nClare appeared to be occupied in stifling a yawn. Her eyes were danger\nsignals, but Elsbeth was not Alwynne to remark them.\n\n\"In one thing, at least, I do thoroughly agree with you. I don't think\nthere is the faintest likelihood of Alwynne's wishing to marry at all at\npresent, but I do feel, with you, that it is unfair to expect her to\noscillate, as you rhetorically put it, between two old maids. I agree,\ntoo, that I have responsibilities in connection with her. In fact, I\nthink she would be happier if she were with me altogether, and I intend\nto ask her to come and live here. I shall ask her to-night. Don't you\nthink she will be pleased?\"\n\nClare's aim was good. Elsbeth clutched at the arms of her chair.\n\n\"You wouldn't do such a thing.\"\n\nClare laughed shrilly.\n\n\"I shall do exactly what your Mr. Lumsden wants to do. I'm not poor. I\ncan give her a home as well as he, if you are so anxious to get her off\nyour hands. She seems to be going begging.\"\n\nElsbeth rose.\n\n\"I'm wasting time. I'll say good-bye, Miss Hartill. I shouldn't have\ncome. But it was for Alwynne's sake. I hoped to touch you, to persuade\nyou to forego, for her future's sake, for the sake of her ultimate\nhappiness, the hold you have on her. I sympathised with you. I knew it\nwould be a sacrifice. I knew, because I made the same sacrifice two\nyears ago, when you first began to attract her. I thought you would\ndevelop her. I am not a clever woman, Miss Hartill, and you are; so I\nmade no stand against you; but it was hard for me. Alwynne did not make\nit easier. She was not always kind. But hearing you to-day, I\nunderstand. You made Alwynne suffer more than I guessed. I don't blame\nher if sometimes it recoiled on me. You were always cruel. I remember\nyou. The others were always snails for you to throw salt upon. I might\nhave known you'd never change. Do you think I don't know your effect on\nthe children at the school? Oh, you are a good teacher! You force them\nsuccessfully; but all the while you eat up their souls. Sneer if you\nlike! Have you forgotten Louise? I tell you, it's vampirism. And now you\nare to take Alwynne. And when she is squeezed dry and flung aside, who\nwill the next victim be? And the next, and the next? You grow greedier\nas you grow older, I suppose. One day you'll be old. What will you do\nwhen your glamour's gone? I tell you, Clare Hartill, you'll die of\nhunger in the end.\"\n\nThe small relentless voice ceased. There was a silence. Clare, who had\nremained quiescent for sheer amaze at the attack from so negligible a\nquarter, pulled herself together. Rather white, she began to clap her\nhands gently, as a critic surprised into applause.\n\n\"My dear woman, you're magnificent! Really you are. I never thought you\nhad it in you. The Law and the Prophets incarnate. How Alwynne will\nlaugh when I tell her. I wish she'd been here. You ought to be on the\nstage, you know, or in the pulpit. Have you quite finished? Quite? Do\nunburden yourself completely, you won't be given another opportunity.\nYou understand that, of course? If Alwynne wishes to see you, she must\nmake arrangements to do so elsewhere. That is the one condition I shall\nmake. This is the way out.\"\n\nElsbeth rose. She was furious with herself that her lips must tremble\nand her hands shake, as she gathered up scarf and reticule; but she\nfollowed her hostess with sufficient dignity.\n\nClare flung open the door with a gesture a shade too ample.\n\nElsbeth laughed tremulously as she passed her and crossed the hall.\n\n\"Oh, you are not altered,\" she said, and bent to fumble at the latch.\n\"But it doesn't impress me. You've not won yet. You count too much on\nAlwynne. And you have still to reckon with Mr. Lumsden.\"\n\n\"And his three acres and a cow!\" Clare watched her contemptuously. It\ndid not seem worth while to keep her dignity with Elsbeth. She felt that\nit would be a relief to lose her temper completely, to override this\nopponent by sheer, crude invective. She let herself go.\n\n\"What a fool you are! Do you flatter yourself that you understand\nAlwynne? Go back to your Coelebs and tell him from Alwynne--I tell you I\nspeak for Alwynne--that he's wasting his time. Let him take his goods to\nanother market: Alwynne won't buy. I've other plans for her--she has\nother plans for yourself. She doesn't want a husband. She doesn't want a\nhome. She doesn't want children. She wants me--and all I stand for. She\nwants to use her talents--and she shall--through me. She wants\nsuccess--she shall have it--through me. She wants friendship--can't I\ngive it? Affection? Haven't I given it? What more can she want? A home?\nI'm well off. A brat to play with? Let her adopt one, and I'll house\nit. I'll give her anything she wants. What more can your man offer? But\nI won't let her go. I tell you, we suffice each other. Thank God, there\nare some women who can do without marriage--marriage--marriage!\"\n\nElsbeth, as if she heard nothing, tugged at the catch. The door swung\nopen, and she stepped quietly into the sunny passage. Then she turned to\nClare, a grey, angry shadow in the dusk of the hall.\n\n\"Poor Clare!\" she said. \"Are the grapes very sour?\"\n\nShe pulled-to the door behind her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater in the evening, as she sat, flushed, tremulous, utterly joyful\nover Roger's telegram, she considered the manner of her exit and was\nshocked at herself.\n\n\"I don't know what possessed me,\" said Elsbeth apologetically. \"And if I\nhad only known. It was unladylike--it was unwomanly--it was\nunchristian.\" She shook her head at her mild self in the glass. \"But she\nmade me so angry! If I'd only known that this was coming!\" She fingered\nthe pink envelope. \"She'll think I knew. She'll always think I knew. And\nthen to say what I did? It was unpardonable.\n\n\"But I was right, all the same,\" cried Elsbeth incorrigibly; \"and I\ndon't care. I'm glad I said it--I'm glad--I'm glad!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n\nThe sun slid over the edge of the sweating earth. Its red-hot plunge\ninto the sea behind the hills was almost audible. The black cloud,\nfuming up from its setting-place, was as the steam of the collision. In\ngreat clots and coils it rolled upwards, spreading as it thinned, till\nit was a pall of vapour that sheeted all the lemon-coloured sky.\nSuddenly a cold wind sprang up, raced down the silent heavens, and, by\nway of Eastern Europe and the North Sea and the straight Roman road that\ndrives down England, tore along the Utterbridge byways, and into the\nopen window of Clare Hartill's parlour. A touch of its cold lips on her\nhair, and brow, and breast, and it was out again, driving the dust\nbefore it.\n\nClare shivered. She was very tired of waiting.... It was inexplicable\nthat Alwynne should be late; but Clare with a half laugh, promised\nAlwynne to forego her scolding if she would but come.... The dusk and\nthe wind and the silence were getting on her nerves.... The tick of the\nhall clock, for instance, was aggressive, insistent, maddening in its\nprecise monotony.... Oh, unbearable! With a gesture that was hysterical\nin its abandonment, Clare rose suddenly and flung into the hall, plucked\nopen the clock door, and removed the pendulum. The released wire waggled\nfoolishly into silence, like an idiot, tongue a-loll.\n\nAs the quiet hunted Clare into her sitting-room again, a little silver\nwire flickered down the sky like a scared snake, and for an instant she\nsaw herself reflected in a convex mirror, a Clare bleached and shining\nand askew, like a St. Michael in a stained-glass window. Dusk and the\nthunder followed. The storm was beginning.\n\nClare moved about restlessly. She disliked storms. Her eyes ached, and\nshe was cramped with waiting, and Alwynne had not come. She would, of\ncourse.... That woman had detained her, purposely, no doubt, and now\nthere was the storm to delay her.... But Alwynne would come.... Clare\nsmiled securely.\n\nAgain the lightning whipped across the heavens, and thunder roared in\nits wake.\n\nClare went to the window and watched the sky. The pane of glass was\ngrateful to her hot forehead. She was too tired, too bruised and shaken\nby her own recent anger to arrange her thoughts, to pose for the moment,\neven to herself--of all audiences the most critical. The interview with\nElsbeth Loveday rehearsed itself incessantly, pricking, probing,\nbludgeoning, in crescendo of intonation, innuendo, open attack, to the\nfinal triumphant insult. Triumphant, because true. The insult could cut\nthrough her defences and strike at her very self, because it was true.\nHer pride agonised. She had thought herself shrouded, invulnerable. And\nyet Elsbeth, whom of all women she had reckoned negligible, had guessed,\nhad pitied.... Yet even her enemy was forgotten, as she sat and\nshuddered at the wound dealt; plucked and shrank, and plucked again at\nthe arrow-tip rankling in it still.\n\nThe hours had passed in an evil mazement. But Alwynne was to come....\nShe thought of Alwynne with shifting passions of relief and longing and\nsheer crude lust for revenge. Alwynne would come.... Alwynne would\nsoothe and comfort, intuitive, never waiting for the cry for help.\n\nAnd Alwynne should pay.... Oho! Alwynne should pay Elsbeth's debts ...\nshould wince, and shrink, and whiten. _Scientific vivisection of one\nnerve._ Wait a little, Alwynne!--Ah, Alwynne--the dearest--the\nbeloved--the light and laughter of one's life.... What fool is\nwhispering that Clare can hurt her?... Alwynne shall see when she comes,\nwho loves her.... There shall be a welcome, the royalest welcome she has\never had.... For what in all the world has Clare but Alwynne, and\nhaving Alwynne, has not Clare the world?\n\nAh, well.... Perhaps, she had not been always good to Alwynne....\nTo-day, for instance, she might have been kinder.... But Alwynne always\nunderstood.... That was the comfort of Alwynne, that she always\nunderstood.... Why didn't she come? Wasn't there an echo of a step far\ndown the street?\n\nWhen Alwynne came, they would make plans.... It would not be easy to\nwean the girl from her aunt, at least while they lived in the same town,\nthe same country.... But one could travel, could take Alwynne quite\naway.... Italy.... Greece.... Egypt.... they would go round the world\ntogether, shake off the school and all it stood for.... In a new world,\nbegin a new life.... Why not? She had money enough to burn.... It would\nnot be hard to persuade Alwynne, adventurous, infatuate.... Once gone,\nElsbeth might whistle for her niece.... They would talk it over\nto-morrow ... to-night ... as soon as Alwynne came....\n\nWas that thunder or a knocking? Rat-tat! Rat-tat! She had not been\nmistaken after all.... Alwynne! Alwynne!\n\nAnd Clare, with an appearance on her that even Alwynne had never seen,\nran like a child to open the door.\n\nOn the threshold stood a messenger boy, proffering a telegram. She took\nit.\n\n\"Any answer, Miss!\" for she had offered to close the door.\n\n\"Oh, of course!\" She frowned, and pulled open the flimsy sheet.\n\nThe boy waited. He peered past her, interested in the odd pictures on\nthe walls, and the glimpse of a table luxuriously set. The minutes sped.\nHe had soon seen all he could, and began to fidget.\n\n\"Any answer, Miss?\" he hinted.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Clare vaguely. \"Answer? No. No answer. No answer at all.\"\n\nThe boy knuckled his forehead and clattered away down the staircase.\n\nMechanically Clare shut the door, locked and bolted it and secured it\nwith the chain. Then she returned to the sitting-room and crossed to her\nformer station by the open window.\n\nThe storm was ending in a downpour of furious tropical rain. It beat in\nunheeded upon her thin dress and bare neck and the open telegram in her\nhands, as, with lips parted and a faint, puzzled pucker between her\nbrows, she conned over the message--\n\n_I cannot come to-night.--I have gone to Dene. I am going to marry\nRoger._\n\nShe read it and re-read, twisting it this way and that, for it was\nbarely visible in the wet dusk. It seemed an eternity before its full\nmeaning dawned upon her. And yet she had known all there was to know\nwhen she confronted the messenger boy (Oh, Destiny is up to date) and\ntook her sentence from his grimy hand.\n\n_I am going to marry Roger._\n\n\"Very well, Alwynne!\" Clare flung up her head, up and back. Her face was\ndrowned in the shadows of the crimson curtain, but her neck caught the\nlast of the light, shone like old marble. The whole soul of her showed\nfor an instant in its defiant outline, in the involuntary pulsation that\nquivered across its rigidity, in the uncontrollable flutter beneath the\nchin.\n\nThe thin, capable fingers twisted and clenched over the sodden paper.\n\nShe moved at last, spoke into space. Passion, anger, and the cool\ncontempt of the school-mistress for a mutinous class, mingled\ngrotesquely in her voice.\n\n\"Very well, Alwynne! Just as you please, of course. There is no more to\nbe said.\" She tossed away the little ball of paper as she spoke.\n\nShe wandered aimlessly about the room; turned to her book-shelves after\na while, and stood a long time, pulling out volume after volume,\nopening each at random, reading a page, closing the book again, letting\nit slide from her hand, never troubling to replace it. She was tired at\nlast and turned to her writing-table.\n\nIt was piled high with exercise-books, and she corrected a couple before\nshe swept them also aside.\n\nThe rain had not faltered in its swishing downfall. It beat against the\npanes, and on to the sill, and dripped down into a pool beneath the open\nwindow.\n\n\"She will have to come back on Monday,\" said Clare suddenly. \"She can't\ngo off like that. There's the school----\" She broke off abruptly, as a\ngust of wind soughed by.\n\n_I cannot come. I have gone to Dene. I am going to marry Roger._ She\ncould hear Alwynne's voice in it, answering.\n\n\"But why?\" cried Clare piteously. \"Why? What is it? What have I done?\"\n\n\"S'hush!\" sighed the rain. \"S'hush!\"\n\n\"I loved her,\" cried Clare. \"I loved her. What have I done?\"\n\n\"S'hush!\" sobbed the rain. \"S'hush! S'hush!\"\n\nShe turned to the darkening windows, and started, and shuddered away\nagain, stricken dumb and shaking. A pool of something red and wet was\nspreading over the polished boards, and a thin trickle was stealing\nforward to her feet.\n\nBlood?\n\nFool.... The red of the curtains reflected, tingeing a pool of\nrain-water.... Blood, nevertheless.... She had forgotten Louise.\n\nWhat had Alwynne heard? A garbled version of that last interview? Fool\nagain--unless the dead can speak.... But Alwynne knew.... Something had\nbeen revealed to her, suddenly, during their idle talk.... But when? But\nhow? She had come as a lover ... she had left as a stranger ... what in\nany god's name, had she guessed? Clare's subconscious memory reproduced\nfor her instantly, with photographic accuracy, details of the scene that\nshe had not even known she had observed. Alwynne had changed, in an\ninstant, between a word and a reply.... What was it that Clare had\nsaid--what trifling, teasing nothing, flung out in pure wantonness? But\nAlwynne's face, her dear face, had become, for an instant--Clare\nstrained to the memory--as the face of Louise.... Louise had looked at\nher like that, that other day.... What had they seen then, both of them?\nWas she Gorgon to bring that look into their faces? Louise--yes--she\ncould understand Louise.... She did not care to think about Louise....\nBut Alwynne--what had she ever done to Alwynne? At least Alwynne might\ntell her what she had done.... She would not submit to it.... She would\nnot be put aside.... She would at least have justice....\n\n_I am going to marry Roger._\n\nUseless! All useless! The struggle was over before she had known she was\nfighting.... She knew that in Alwynne's life there was no longer any\npart for her. And Clare had travelled far that evening, to phrase it\nthus. Sharing was a strange word for her to use. But she recognised\ndully that even sharing was out of her power. What had she to do with a\nhusband, and housewifery, and the bearing of children? Alwynne married\nwas Alwynne dead.\n\nAlwynne in love.... Alwynne married.... Alwynne putting any living thing\nbefore Clare! She broke into bitter laughter at the idea. What had\nhappened? What had Clare done or left undone? She realised grimly that\nof this at least she might be sure--it had been her own doing.... No\ninfluence could have wrought against her own.... Alwynne, at least, was\nwhere she was, because Clare had sent her, not because another had\nbeckoned.... And that was the comfort she had stored up for herself, to\nlast her in the lean years to come....\n\nWhat was the use of regretting?\n\nAlwynne was gone.... Then forget her.... There were other fish in the\nsea.... There was a promising class this term.... That child in the\nFourth.... She wondered if Alwynne had noticed her.... She must ask\nAlwynne.... Alwynne had gone away, had gone to Dene, was going to marry\nRoger....\n\nWell, there was always work.... Where was that letter to Miss Marsham?\n\nShe moved stiffly in her seat, lit a candle, and drew towards her the\nhalf-written sheet that lay open on the blotter. She re-read it.\n\n_You will, I am sure, understand how much I appreciate your offer of the\npartnership, but after much consideration I have decided_----\n\nShe hesitated, crossed out the _but_ and wrote an _and_ above it, and\ncontinued--\n\n--_to accept it. I will come to tea to-morrow, as you kindly suggest._\n\nShe finished the letter, signed it, stamped and addressed, and sat idle\nat last, staring down at it.\n\nThe neat handwriting danced, and flickered, and grew dim.\n\nWith an awkward gesture she put her hands to her eyes, and brought them\naway again, wet. She smiled at that, a twisted, mocking smile. She\nsupposed she was crying.... She did not remember ever having done such a\nthing....\n\nSo her future was decided.... It was to be work and\nloneliness--loneliness and work ... because, it seemed, she had no\nfriends left.... Yet Alwynne had promised many things.... What had she\ndone to Alwynne? What had she done?\n\nShe turned within herself and reviewed her life as she remembered it,\nthought by thought, word by word, action by action. Faces rose about\nher, whispering reminders, forgotten faces of the many who had loved\nher: from her old nurse, dead long ago, to Louise, and Alwynne, and\nfoolish Olivia Pring.\n\nThe candle at her elbow flared and dribbled, and died at last with a\nsplutter and a gasp. She paid no heed.\n\nWhen the dawn came, she was still sitting there, thinking--thinking.\n\n  _March 1914--September 1915._\n\n\n  THE END\n\n\n  PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n\nPunctuation and formatting markup have been normalized.\n\n\"_\" surrounding text represents italics.\n\nApparent printer's errors have been retained, unless stated below.\n\nPage 22, \"critise\" changed to \"criticise\".

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":633,"split":"train"}
