{"ori_id":"6ea31b70e5af494ad2b7623d06b6487b3953b20d","title":"12 Years a Slave (film)","context":"12 Years a Slave (film)\n In 1841, Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive, the duo drug Northup and conspire to deliver him to a slave pen. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with others who have been detained against their will. A slave trader named Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him and another slave Eliza to plantation owner William Ford. Due to tension between Northup and another plantation worker, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man, but to no avail.\nSome time later, an outbreak of cotton worm befalls Epps' plantation. Unable to work his fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts to use the money to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York state. Armsby agrees to deliver the letter, and accepts Northup's saved money in return, but later betrays him to Epps. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and avoids punishment.\nNorthup begins working on the construction of a gazebo with a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass. Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Patsy sneaks off to Mistress Shaw's house to get some soap to clean herself. Epps calls her a liar and ties her to post to prepare her for a whipping. Epps hands the whip to Northup and forces him to whip Patsy. Northup reluctantly begins to whip her but Epps rips the whip out of Northup's hands and unleashes a brutal whipping on Patsy. Her back is shredded and her flesh is torn apart. Later Northup confides his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Bass, risking his life, agrees to send it. One day, Northup is called over by the local sheriff, who arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent him from leaving.\nAfter being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is restored to freedom and returned to his family. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave, his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial.\n<html>\n<head><title>12 Years a Slave Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"12 Years a Slave script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"12 Years a Slave script, 12 Years a Slave movie script, 12 Years a Slave film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

   Written by\n\n                              John Ridley\n\n\n\n\n<b>                              CARD: 1841\n<\/b>\n<b>                               FADE IN:\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n<b>          1 INT. TOWNHOUSE\/STUDY - DAY 1\n<\/b>\n\n<b>           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-\n<\/b>           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A\n\n<b>           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.\n<\/b>\n           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high\n           end piece, but it is quite nice.\n\n           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair\n           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late\n           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,\n           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.\n           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.\n\n           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing\n           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to\n           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n\n<b>           INT. HOUSE\/LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n<\/b>\n           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being\n           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In\n           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are\n           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women\n           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense\n           that for the most part they are people of means.\n\n           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At\n           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a\n<b>           REEL.\n<\/b>\n           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,\n           having cut directly from the tune he was previously\n           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no\n           way seems possessed with empty servitude.\n\n           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into\n           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal\n           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear\n           that despite their respective races there is much\n           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.\n\n                         \n\n\n<b>           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE\/BEDROOM - MORNING\n<\/b>\n           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is\n           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We\n           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and\n           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed\n           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,\n\n                         \n\n<b>                          (CONTINUED)\n<\/b>\n<b>          2.\n<\/b>\n<b>                         3 CONTINUED: 3\n<\/b>           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if\n           preparing to pose for a portrait.\n           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.\n           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY\n           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,\n           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his\n           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and\n           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and\n           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss\n           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.\n\n                         \n\n\n<b>           EXT. STREET - DAY\n<\/b>\n           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets\n           and groves of Saratoga.\n\n           The streets are well populated this morning with many\n           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are\n           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly\n           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.\n           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their\n           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south\n           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are\n           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are\n           well dressed and \"leading apparently an easy life\" -\n           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.\n\n           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an\n           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart\n           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the\n           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for\n           Solomon to help her across.\n\n<b>                          ANNE\n<\/b>           Solomon...\n           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile\n           waving her forward:\n\n<b>                          SOLOMON\n<\/b>           Come, Anne. Jump.\n\n           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.\n\n<b>                          ALONZO MARGARET\n<\/b>           Jump. You can make it. I've done it.

Catch\n           me!\n\n           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's\n           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne\n           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon\n           replies.\n\n                         \n\n<b>                          (CONTINUED)\n<\/b>\n<b>          3.\n<\/b>\n\n<b>                          SOLOMON\n<\/b>           I will catch you, Anne.\n\n<b>                          (BEAT)\n<\/b>           I will.\n           Again, lightly stern:\n\n<b>                          ANNE\n<\/b>           You will.\n\n           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,\n           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to\n           the delighted applause of the children. That done,\n           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.\n\n           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the\n           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.\n           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon\n           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of\n           this most handsome and harmonious group should be\n           obvious.\n\n           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the\n           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.\n           Suddenly a voice barks out-\n\n<b>           A VOICE (O.S.)\n<\/b>           Jasper! Come on!\n\n                         \n\n<b>           INT. STORE - LATER\n<\/b>\n           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man\n           and a supplier of general goods.

He finds himself in a nearly lightless\n           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid\n           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small\n           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only\n           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box\n           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are\n           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and\n           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But\n           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.\n           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He\n           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails\n           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and\n           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams\n           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his\n           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.\n           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,\n           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed\n           state he remains.\n\n                         \n\n<b>                         25 25\n<\/b>\n<b>           INT.

Enter\n           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER\n           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.\n           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into\n           the otherwise near-black room.

He searches one, then the other, but they are\n           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his\n           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,\n           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will\n           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:\n\n<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Yah no free man. And yah ain't\n           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.\n           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon\n           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man\n           yielding.

Both men exchange a long and daring stare.\n           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,\n           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT\n\n<b>           DISTINGUISH.\n<\/b>           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of\n           \"instruments:\" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is\n           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and\n           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also\n           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many\n           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the\n           extremity of each. Burch says again:\n\n<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.\n           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say\n           nothing of the kind.\n           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is\n           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his\n           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon\n           down in a bent position.\n           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the\n           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no\n           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each\n           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND\n\n<b>           BRUISES.\n<\/b>           This beating continues on and on and on until quite\n           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.\n           Dripping in sweat and panting:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>                          (CONTINUED)\n<\/b>\n<b>          18.\n<\/b>\n<b>                         25 CONTINUED: (2) 25\n<\/b>\n<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Yah still insist yah a free man?\n\n<b>                          SOLOMON\n<\/b>           ...I...I insist...\n           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but\n           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to\n           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch\n           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows\n\n<b>                          WITH:\n<\/b>\n<b>                          BURCH\n<\/b>           Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!\n           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until\n           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.\n           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,\n           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's\n           arm tires before Solomon \"breaks.\"\n\n<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Are yah slave?\n\n<b>                          SOLOMON\n<\/b>           ...No...\n           Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...\n\n<b>           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND\n<\/b>           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He\n           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough\n           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn\n           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's\n           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these\n           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one\n           wrought with poor sincerity::\n\n<b>                          RADBURN\n<\/b>           I seen a good many of the black\n           kind just where yah're.

Things end as they\n           should, and the violence was for\n           naught. So why cause trouble when\n           they ain't no cause for it?

Solomon rests. But to\n           rest seems like giving in to defeat.

Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around\n           the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,\n           however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as\n           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.\n           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and\n           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely\n           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts\n           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.\n           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in\n           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after\n           Solomon.

Cautiously, Solomon\n           moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within\n           striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases\n           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more\n           drops down.

Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,\n           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep\n           breathing above her.

All that\n           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.\n           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna\n           turns away from Solomon.

His eyes fixed on\n           something that is a million miles away.\n           Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg\n           tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound\n           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as\n           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the\n           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.\n           He then repeats the action.\n           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb\n           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it\n           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it\n           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the\n           ground.\n           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it\n           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small\n           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of\n           violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in\n           an odd way, respectful.\n\n                         \n\n<b>                         168 168\n<\/b>\n<b>           EXT.
