{"ori_id":"ba4195db69ed45a0fe3a33e7179aeef7d29bc2ca","title":"Riders of the Purple Sage","context":"Riders of the Purple Sage\n The events depicted in Riders of the Purple Sage occur in mid-spring and late summer 1871. Early in Riders of the Purple Sage, Jane Withersteen's main conflict is her right to befriend a Gentile. (The word Gentile means \"non-Mormon\" and is used a lot in the book). Jane Withersteen\u2019s father wished Jane to marry Elder Tull, but Jane refused saying she did not love him, causing controversy and leading to persecution by the local Mormons.\nJane\u2019s friend, (cowboy) Bern Venters is \"arrested\" by Tull and his men, but is not clear under what authority. Jane defends Venters, declaring him her best rider. Her churchmen refuse to value the opinion of a woman:\n\"Tull lifted a shaking finger toward her. 'That'll do from you. Understand, you'll not be allowed to hold this boy [Venters] to a friendship that's offensive to your bishop. Jane Withersteen, your father left you wealth and power. It has turned your head. You haven't yet come to see the place of Mormon women ...'\"\nIt is here we first hear of Lassiter. Ironically, at the moment when Venters mentions Lassiter\u2019s name, the actual Lassiter is seen approaching in the distance by Tull\u2019s men.\nUpon his arrival, Lassiter expresses his trust in the word of women, at which Tull rebukes him, telling him not to meddle in Mormon affairs. Tull\u2019s men begin to take Venters away, and Venters realizes who he is and screams \"Lassiter!\" Tull understands that this is the infamous Lassiter and flees.\nLassiter inquires as to the location of Millie Erne's grave, to which a transfixed Jane agrees to take him. Venters later tells Jane he must leave her. When she protests, Venters delivers this statement: \" ... Tull is implacable. You ought to see from his intention today that ... but you can't see. Your blindness ... your damned religion! Jane, forgive me ... I'm sore within and something rankles. Well, I fear that invisible hand [of Mormon power in the region] will turn its hidden work to your ruin.\", showing that Venters could see far into the future, and although Jane rebukes his statement, he is indeed correct.\nJane\u2019s red herd is rustled shortly afterward and Venters tracks it and returns it to Jane. Bern finds the herd, but, in his travels, wages a gun battle with two of Oldring\u2019s rustlers, killing one and managing to wound Oldring\u2019s notorious Masked Rider. Upon further examination, he removes the mask and shirt of the wounded rider and learns that the Masked Rider is a young woman named Bess whom he believes had been abused by Oldring. Venters experiences a large amount of guilt about shooting a girl and decides that it is his duty to save her.\nVenters discovers Surprise Valley and Balancing Rock, where he takes Bess, the girl he has found. Bess gradually gains health and begins to fall in love with Venters who begins to fall in love with Bess. Each explain their individual stories ambiguously, but through Venters' dedicated care for Bess, the pair forms a mutual love that leads to their resolve to marry. Bess also discovered the truth concerning Oldring\u2019s rustlers, who rustled cattle only to disguise their true lifestyle of surviving off gold in the streams and business deals with the Mormons.\nVenters then determines that there is a need for supplies warranting a trip back to Cottonwoods. On his way, Venters sees Jane Withersteen\u2019s prize horses being stolen. He kills the thieves and retrieves the horses for Jane, but unfortunately loses his horse, Wrangle.\nJane\u2019s horses are returned to her, and are locked in the entry hall to Withersteen's house. Venters officially breaks his friendship with Jane at this time. He goes into the village and proclaimed that he was breaking his friendship and leaving. After he leaves, Jane\u2019s other herd gets stolen.\nJane at first pretends to love Lassiter \u2014 knowing he came to Utah to avenge his sister Milly Erne \u2014 to prevent him from murdering Mormon elders she knew were guilty. The two characters grow to love each other. Then Jane's adopted daughter Fay is kidnapped and Lassiter kills Bishop Dyer while risking his own life.\nThe four main characters \u2014 Venters, Bess, Lassiter, and Jane \u2014 realize that they can no longer safely stay in Utah. Lassiter convinces Jane to prepare to leave with him, Lassiter determines the name of a Mormon who contributed to the ruin of Milly and Jane implicates her father in the proselytizing of Milly. In a state of shock, Jane packs.\nMeanwhile, in Surprise Valley, Venters and Bess are preparing to leave as Jane and Lassiter departing, except on burros. Lassiter sets fire to Withersteen House and flees on horseback with Jane. They encounter Venters and Bess in travel. Before they part, Lassiter explains that Bess is not really Bess Oldring, but actually Elizabeth Erne, the lost daughter of Milly Erne.\nJane gives Venters her horses, Venters and Bess gallop for Venters' Illinois home, and Lassiter and Jane find refuge in Venters' valley paradise. On the way, Lassiter rescues Fay, but they are pursued to Surprise Valley. As Tull and his men begin to climb up the cliffside, Jane shouts to Lassiter to \"roll the stone,\" which he does. The ensuing avalanche closes the outlet to Deception Pass \"forever.\" (This is, of course, not true, as Jane, Lassiter, and Fay return in Grey's sequel, The Rainbow Trail\/The Desert Crucible.)\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Riders of the Purple Sage, by Zane Grey\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

LASSITER\n\nA sharp clip-crop of iron-shod hoofs deadened and died away, and clouds\nof yellow dust drifted from under the cottonwoods out over the sage.\n\nJane Withersteen gazed down the wide purple slope with dreamy and\ntroubled eyes. A rider had just left her and it was his message that\nheld her thoughtful and almost sad, awaiting the churchmen who were\ncoming to resent and attack her right to befriend a Gentile.\n\nShe wondered if the unrest and strife that had lately come to the\nlittle village of Cottonwoods was to involve her. And then she sighed,\nremembering that her father had founded this remotest border settlement\nof southern Utah and that he had left it to her. She owned all the\nground and many of the cottages. Withersteen House was hers, and the\ngreat ranch, with its thousands of cattle, and the swiftest horses of\nthe sage. To her belonged Amber Spring, the water which gave verdure\nand beauty to the village and made living possible on that wild purple\nupland waste. She could not escape being involved by whatever befell\nCottonwoods.\n\nThat year, 1871, had marked a change which had been gradually coming\nin the lives of the peace-loving Mormons of the border. Glaze--Stone\nBridge--Sterling, villages to the north, had risen against the\ninvasion of Gentile settlers and the forays of rustlers. There had been\nopposition to the one and fighting with the other. And now Cottonwoods\nhad begun to wake and bestir itself and grown hard.\n\nJane prayed that the tranquillity and sweetness of her life would not be\npermanently disrupted. She meant to do so much more for her people than\nshe had done. She wanted the sleepy quiet pastoral days to last always.\nTrouble between the Mormons and the Gentiles of the community would\nmake her unhappy. She was Mormon-born, and she was a friend to poor\nand unfortunate Gentiles. She wished only to go on doing good and being\nhappy. And she thought of what that great ranch meant to her. She loved\nit all--the grove of cottonwoods, the old stone house, the amber-tinted\nwater, and the droves of shaggy, dusty horses and mustangs, the sleek,\nclean-limbed, blooded racers, and the browsing herds of cattle and the\nlean, sun-browned riders of the sage.\n\nWhile she waited there she forgot the prospect of untoward change. The\nbray of a lazy burro broke the afternoon quiet, and it was comfortingly\nsuggestive of the drowsy farmyard, and the open corrals, and the green\nalfalfa fields. Her clear sight intensified the purple sage-slope as it\nrolled before her. Low swells of prairie-like ground sloped up to\nthe west. Dark, lonely cedar-trees, few and far between, stood out\nstrikingly, and at long distances ruins of red rocks. Farther on, up the\ngradual slope, rose a broken wall, a huge monument, looming dark purple\nand stretching its solitary, mystic way, a wavering line that faded\nin the north. Here to the westward was the light and color and beauty.\nNorthward the slope descended to a dim line of canyons from which rose\nan up-flinging of the earth, not mountainous, but a vast heave of purple\nuplands, with ribbed and fan-shaped walls, castle-crowned cliffs, and\ngray escarpments. Over it all crept the lengthening, waning afternoon\nshadows.\n\nThe rapid beat of hoofs recalled Jane Withersteen to the question at\nhand. A group of riders cantered up the lane, dismounted, and threw\ntheir bridles. They were seven in number, and Tull, the leader, a tall,\ndark man, was an elder of Jane's church.\n\n\"Did you get my message?\" he asked, curtly.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jane.\n\n\"I sent word I'd give that rider Venters half an hour to come down to\nthe village. He didn't come.\"\n\n\"He knows nothing of it;\" said Jane. \"I didn't tell him. I've been\nwaiting here for you.\"\n\n\"Where is Venters?\"\n\n\"I left him in the courtyard.\"\n\n\"Here, Jerry,\" called Tull, turning to his men, \"take the gang and fetch\nVenters out here if you have to rope him.\"\n\nThe dusty-booted and long-spurred riders clanked noisily into the grove\nof cottonwoods and disappeared in the shade.\n\n\"Elder Tull, what do you mean by this?\" demanded Jane. \"If you must\narrest Venters you might have the courtesy to wait till he leaves my\nhome. And if you do arrest him it will be adding insult to injury. It's\nabsurd to accuse Venters of being mixed up in that shooting fray in the\nvillage last night. He was with me at the time. Besides, he let me take\ncharge of his guns. You're only using this as a pretext. What do you\nmean to do to Venters?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you presently,\" replied Tull. \"But first tell me why you\ndefend this worthless rider?\"\n\n\"Worthless!\" exclaimed Jane, indignantly. \"He's nothing of the kind.\nHe was the best rider I ever had. There's not a reason why I shouldn't\nchampion him and every reason why I should. It's no little shame to me,\nElder Tull, that through my friendship he has roused the enmity of my\npeople and become an outcast. Besides I owe him eternal gratitude for\nsaving the life of little Fay.\"\n\n\"I've heard of your love for Fay Larkin and that you intend to adopt\nher. But--Jane Withersteen, the child is a Gentile!\"\n\n\"Yes. But, Elder, I don't love the Mormon children any less because I\nlove a Gentile child. I shall adopt Fay if her mother will give her to\nme.\"\n\n\"I'm not so much against that. You can give the child Mormon teaching,\"\nsaid Tull. \"But I'm sick of seeing this fellow Venters hang around you.\nI'm going to put a stop to it. You've so much love to throw away on\nthese beggars of Gentiles that I've an idea you might love Venters.\"\n\nTull spoke with the arrogance of a Mormon whose power could not be\nbrooked and with the passion of a man in whom jealousy had kindled a\nconsuming fire.\n\n\"Maybe I do love him,\" said Jane. She felt both fear and anger stir her\nheart. \"I'd never thought of that. Poor fellow! he certainly needs some\none to love him.\"\n\n\"This'll be a bad day for Venters unless you deny that,\" returned Tull,\ngrimly.\n\nTull's men appeared under the cottonwoods and led a young man out into\nthe lane. His ragged clothes were those of an outcast. But he stood tall\nand straight, his wide shoulders flung back, with the muscles of his\nbound arms rippling and a blue flame of defiance in the gaze he bent on\nTull.\n\nFor the first time Jane Withersteen felt Venters's real spirit. She\nwondered if she would love this splendid youth. Then her emotion cooled\nto the sobering sense of the issue at stake.\n\n\"Venters, will you leave Cottonwoods at once and forever?\" asked Tull,\ntensely.\n\n\"Why?\" rejoined the rider.\n\n\"Because I order it.\"\n\nVenters laughed in cool disdain.\n\nThe red leaped to Tull's dark cheek.\n\n\"If you don't go it means your ruin,\" he said, sharply.\n\n\"Ruin!\" exclaimed Venters, passionately. \"Haven't you already ruined me?\nWhat do you call ruin? A year ago I was a rider. I had horses and cattle\nof my own. I had a good name in Cottonwoods. And now when I come into\nthe village to see this woman you set your men on me. You hound me. You\ntrail me as if I were a rustler. I've no more to lose--except my life.\"\n\n\"Will you leave Utah?\"\n\n\"Oh! I know,\" went on Venters, tauntingly, \"it galls you, the idea of\nbeautiful Jane Withersteen being friendly to a poor Gentile. You want\nher all yourself. You're a wiving Mormon. You have use for her--and\nWithersteen House and Amber Spring and seven thousand head of cattle!\"\n\nTull's hard jaw protruded, and rioting blood corded the veins of his\nneck.\n\n\"Once more. Will you go?\"\n\n\"NO!\"\n\n\"Then I'll have you whipped within an inch of your life,\" replied Tull,\nharshly. \"I'll turn you out in the sage. And if you ever come back\nyou'll get worse.\"\n\nVenters's agitated face grew coldly set and the bronze changed\n\nJane impulsively stepped forward. \"Oh! Elder Tull!\" she cried. \"You\nwon't do that!\"\n\nTull lifted a shaking finger toward her.\n\n\"That'll do from you. Understand, you'll not be allowed to hold this boy\nto a friendship that's offensive to your Bishop. Jane Withersteen, your\nfather left you wealth and power. It has turned your head. You haven't\nyet come to see the place of Mormon women. We've reasoned with you,\nborne with you. We've patiently waited. We've let you have your fling,\nwhich is more than I ever saw granted to a Mormon woman. But you haven't\ncome to your senses. Now, once for all, you can't have any further\nfriendship with Venters. He's going to be whipped, and he's got to leave\nUtah!\"\n\n\"Oh! Don't whip him! It would be dastardly!\" implored Jane, with slow\ncertainty of her failing courage.\n\nTull always blunted her spirit, and she grew conscious that she had\nfeigned a boldness which she did not possess. He loomed up now in\ndifferent guise, not as a jealous suitor, but embodying the mysterious\ndespotism she had known from childhood--the power of her creed.\n\n\"Venters, will you take your whipping here or would you rather go out\nin the sage?\" asked Tull. He smiled a flinty smile that was more\nthan inhuman, yet seemed to give out of its dark aloofness a gleam of\nrighteousness.\n\n\"I'll take it here--if I must,\" said Venters. \"But by God!--Tull you'd\nbetter kill me outright. That'll be a dear whipping for you and your\npraying Mormons. You'll make me another Lassiter!\"\n\nThe strange glow, the austere light which radiated from Tull's face,\nmight have been a holy joy at the spiritual conception of exalted duty.\nBut there was something more in him, barely hidden, a something personal\nand sinister, a deep of himself, an engulfing abyss. As his religious\nmood was fanatical and inexorable, so would his physical hate be\nmerciless.\n\n\"Elder, I--I repent my words,\" Jane faltered. The religion in her, the\nlong habit of obedience, of humility, as well as agony of fear, spoke in\nher voice. \"Spare the boy!\" she whispered.\n\n\"You can't save him now,\" replied Tull stridently.\n\nHer head was bowing to the inevitable. She was grasping the truth,\nwhen suddenly there came, in inward constriction, a hardening of gentle\nforces within her breast. Like a steel bar it was stiffening all that\nhad been soft and weak in her. She felt a birth in her of something new\nand unintelligible. Once more her strained gaze sought the sage-slopes.\nJane Withersteen loved that wild and purple wilderness. In times\nof sorrow it had been her strength, in happiness its beauty was her\ncontinual delight. In her extremity she found herself murmuring, \"Whence\ncometh my help!\" It was a prayer, as if forth from those lonely purple\nreaches and walls of red and clefts of blue might ride a fearless man,\nneither creed-bound nor creed-mad, who would hold up a restraining hand\nin the faces of her ruthless people.\n\nThe restless movements of Tull's men suddenly quieted down. Then\nfollowed a low whisper, a rustle, a sharp exclamation.\n\n\"Look!\" said one, pointing to the west.\n\n\"A rider!\"\n\nJane Withersteen wheeled and saw a horseman, silhouetted against the\nwestern sky, coming riding out of the sage. He had ridden down from the\nleft, in the golden glare of the sun, and had been unobserved till close\nat hand. An answer to her prayer!\n\n\"Do you know him? Does any one know him?\" questioned Tull, hurriedly.\n\nHis men looked and looked, and one by one shook their heads.\n\n\"He's come from far,\" said one.\n\n\"Thet's a fine hoss,\" said another.\n\n\"A strange rider.\"\n\n\"Huh! he wears black leather,\" added a fourth.\n\nWith a wave of his hand, enjoining silence, Tull stepped forward in such\na way that he concealed Venters.\n\nThe rider reined in his mount, and with a lithe forward-slipping\naction appeared to reach the ground in one long step. It was a peculiar\nmovement in its quickness and inasmuch that while performing it the\nrider did not swerve in the slightest from a square front to the group\nbefore him.\n\n\"Look!\" hoarsely whispered one of Tull's companions. \"He packs two\nblack-butted guns--low down--they're hard to see--black akin them black\nchaps.\"\n\n\"A gun-man!\" whispered another. \"Fellers, careful now about movin' your\nhands.\"\n\nThe stranger's slow approach might have been a mere leisurely manner of\ngait or the cramped short steps of a rider unused to walking; yet, as\nwell, it could have been the guarded advance of one who took no chances\nwith men.\n\n\"Hello, stranger!\" called Tull. No welcome was in this greeting only a\ngruff curiosity.\n\nThe rider responded with a curt nod. The wide brim of a black sombrero\ncast a dark shade over his face. For a moment he closely regarded Tull\nand his comrades, and then, halting in his slow walk, he seemed to\nrelax.\n\n\"Evenin', ma'am,\" he said to Jane, and removed his sombrero with quaint\ngrace.\n\nJane, greeting him, looked up into a face that she trusted instinctively\nand which riveted her attention. It had all the characteristics of\nthe range rider's--the leanness, the red burn of the sun, and the set\nchangelessness that came from years of silence and solitude. But it was\nnot these which held her, rather the intensity of his gaze, a strained\nweariness, a piercing wistfulness of keen, gray sight, as if the man\nwas forever looking for that which he never found. Jane's subtle woman's\nintuition, even in that brief instant, felt a sadness, a hungering, a\nsecret.\n\n\"Jane Withersteen, ma'am?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\n\"The water here is yours?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"May I water my horse?\"\n\n\"Certainly. There's the trough.\"\n\n\"But mebbe if you knew who I was--\" He hesitated, with his glance on\nthe listening men. \"Mebbe you wouldn't let me water him--though I ain't\naskin' none for myself.\"\n\n\"Stranger, it doesn't matter who you are. Water your horse. And if you\nare thirsty and hungry come into my house.\"\n\n\"Thanks, ma'am. I can't accept for myself--but for my tired horse--\"\n\nTrampling of hoofs interrupted the rider. More restless movements on\nthe part of Tull's men broke up the little circle, exposing the prisoner\nVenters.\n\n\"Mebbe I've kind of hindered somethin'--for a few moments, perhaps?\"\ninquired the rider.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jane Withersteen, with a throb in her voice.\n\nShe felt the drawing power of his eyes; and then she saw him look at the\nbound Venters, and at the men who held him, and their leader.\n\n\"In this here country all the rustlers an' thieves an' cut-throats\nan' gun-throwers an' all-round no-good men jest happen to be Gentiles.\nMa'am, which of the no-good class does that young feller belong to?\"\n\n\"He belongs to none of them. He's an honest boy.\"\n\n\"You KNOW that, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes.\"\n\n\"Then what has he done to get tied up that way?\"\n\nHis clear and distinct question, meant for Tull as well as for Jane\nWithersteen, stilled the restlessness and brought a momentary silence.\n\n\"Ask him,\" replied Jane, her voice rising high.\n\nThe rider stepped away from her, moving out with the same slow, measured\nstride in which he had approached, and the fact that his action placed\nher wholly to one side, and him no nearer to Tull and his men, had a\npenetrating significance.\n\n\"Young feller, speak up,\" he said to Venters.\n\n\"Here stranger, this's none of your mix,\" began Tull. \"Don't try any\ninterference. You've been asked to drink and eat. That's more than you'd\nhave got in any other village of the Utah border. Water your horse and\nbe on your way.\"\n\n\"Easy--easy--I ain't interferin' yet,\" replied the rider. The tone of\nhis voice had undergone a change. A different man had spoken. Where, in\naddressing Jane, he had been mild and gentle, now, with his first speech\nto Tull, he was dry, cool, biting. \"I've lest stumbled onto a queer\ndeal. Seven Mormons all packin' guns, an' a Gentile tied with a rope,\nan' a woman who swears by his honesty! Queer, ain't that?\"\n\n\"Queer or not, it's none of your business,\" retorted Tull.\n\n\"Where I was raised a woman's word was law. I ain't quite outgrowed that\nyet.\"\n\nTull fumed between amaze and anger.\n\n\"Meddler, we have a law here something different from woman's\nwhim--Mormon law!... Take care you don't transgress it.\"\n\n\"To hell with your Mormon law!\"\n\nThe deliberate speech marked the rider's further change, this time from\nkindly interest to an awakening menace. It produced a transformation in\nTull and his companions. The leader gasped and staggered backward at\na blasphemous affront to an institution he held most sacred. The man\nJerry, holding the horses, dropped the bridles and froze in his tracks.\nLike posts the other men stood watchful-eyed, arms hanging rigid, all\nwaiting.\n\n\"Speak up now, young man. What have you done to be roped that way?\"\n\n\"It's a damned outrage!\" burst out Venters. \"I've done no wrong. I've\noffended this Mormon Elder by being a friend to that woman.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, is it true--what he says?\" asked the rider of Jane, but his\nquiveringly alert eyes never left the little knot of quiet men.\n\n\"True? Yes, perfectly true,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well, young man, it seems to me that bein' a friend to such a woman\nwould be what you wouldn't want to help an' couldn't help.... What's to\nbe done to you for it?\"\n\n\"They intend to whip me. You know what that means--in Utah!\"\n\n\"I reckon,\" replied the rider, slowly.\n\nWith his gray glance cold on the Mormons, with the restive bit-champing\nof the horses, with Jane failing to repress her mounting agitations,\nwith Venters standing pale and still, the tension of the moment\ntightened. Tull broke the spell with a laugh, a laugh without mirth, a\nlaugh that was only a sound betraying fear.\n\n\"Come on, men!\" he called.\n\nJane Withersteen turned again to the rider.\n\n\"Stranger, can you do nothing to save Venters?\"\n\n\"Ma'am, you ask me to save him--from your own people?\"\n\n\"Ask you? I beg of you!\"\n\n\"But you don't dream who you're askin'.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, I pray you--save him!\"\n\n\"These are Mormons, an' I...\"\n\n\"At--at any cost--save him. For I--I care for him!\"\n\nTull snarled. \"You love-sick fool! Tell your secrets. There'll be a way\nto teach you what you've never learned.... Come men out of here!\"\n\n\"Mormon, the young man stays,\" said the rider.\n\nLike a shot his voice halted Tull.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Who'll keep him? He's my prisoner!\" cried Tull, hotly. \"Stranger, again\nI tell you--don't mix here. You've meddled enough. Go your way now or--\"\n\n\"Listen!... He stays.\"\n\nAbsolute certainty, beyond any shadow of doubt, breathed in the rider's\nlow voice.\n\n\"Who are you? We are seven here.\"\n\nThe rider dropped his sombrero and made a rapid movement, singular in\nthat it left him somewhat crouched, arms bent and stiff, with the big\nblack gun-sheaths swung round to the fore.\n\n\"LASSITER!\"\n\nIt was Venters's wondering, thrilling cry that bridged the fateful\nconnection between the rider's singular position and the dreaded name.\n\nTull put out a groping hand. The life of his eyes dulled to the gloom\nwith which men of his fear saw the approach of death. But death, while\nit hovered over him, did not descend, for the rider waited for the\ntwitching fingers, the downward flash of hand that did not come. Tull,\ngathering himself together, turned to the horses, attended by his pale\ncomrades.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. COTTONWOODS\n\nVenters appeared too deeply moved to speak the gratitude his face\nexpressed. And Jane turned upon the rescuer and gripped his hands.\nHer smiles and tears seemingly dazed him. Presently as something like\ncalmness returned, she went to Lassiter's weary horse.\n\n\"I will water him myself,\" she said, and she led the horse to a trough\nunder a huge old cottonwood. With nimble fingers she loosened the bridle\nand removed the bit. The horse snorted and bent his head. The trough was\nof solid stone, hollowed out, moss-covered and green and wet and cool,\nand the clear brown water that fed it spouted and splashed from a wooden\npipe.\n\n\"He has brought you far to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, a matter of over sixty miles, mebbe seventy.\"\n\n\"A long ride--a ride that--Ah, he is blind!\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Lassiter.\n\n\"What blinded him?\"\n\n\"Some men once roped an' tied him, an' then held white-iron close to his\neyes.\"\n\n\"Oh! Men? You mean devils.... Were they your enemies--Mormons?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"To take revenge on a horse! Lassiter, the men of my creed are\nunnaturally cruel. To my everlasting sorrow I confess it. They have been\ndriven, hated, scourged till their hearts have hardened. But we women\nhope and pray for the time when our men will soften.\"\n\n\"Beggin' your pardon, ma'am--that time will never come.\"\n\n\"Oh, it will!... Lassiter, do you think Mormon women wicked? Has your\nhand been against them, too?\"\n\n\"No. I believe Mormon women are the best and noblest, the most\nlong-sufferin', and the blindest, unhappiest women on earth.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" She gave him a grave, thoughtful look. \"Then you will break bread\nwith me?\"\n\nLassiter had no ready response, and he uneasily shifted his weight\nfrom one leg to another, and turned his sombrero round and round in his\nhands. \"Ma'am,\" he began, presently, \"I reckon your kindness of heart\nmakes you overlook things. Perhaps I ain't well known hereabouts, but\nback up North there's Mormons who'd rest uneasy in their graves at the\nidea of me sittin' to table with you.\"\n\n\"I dare say. But--will you do it, anyway?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mebbe you have a brother or relative who might drop in an' be offended,\nan' I wouldn't want to--\"\n\n\"I've not a relative in Utah that I know of. There's no one with a right\nto question my actions.\" She turned smilingly to Venters. \"You will come\nin, Bern, and Lassiter will come in. We'll eat and be merry while we\nmay.\"\n\n\"I'm only wonderin' if Tull an' his men'll raise a storm down in the\nvillage,\" said Lassiter, in his last weakening stand.\n\n\"Yes, he'll raise the storm--after he has prayed,\" replied Jane. \"Come.\"\n\nShe led the way, with the bridle of Lassiter's horse over her arm.\nThey entered a grove and walked down a wide path shaded by great\nlow-branching cottonwoods. The last rays of the setting sun sent golden\nbars through the leaves. The grass was deep and rich, welcome contrast\nto sage-tired eyes. Twittering quail darted across the path, and from a\ntree-top somewhere a robin sang its evening song, and on the still air\nfloated the freshness and murmur of flowing water.\n\nThe home of Jane Withersteen stood in a circle of cottonwoods, and was\na flat, long, red-stone structure with a covered court in the center\nthrough which flowed a lively stream of amber-colored water. In the\nmassive blocks of stone and heavy timbers and solid doors and shutters\nshowed the hand of a man who had builded against pillage and time; and\nin the flowers and mosses lining the stone-bedded stream, in the bright\ncolors of rugs and blankets on the court floor, and the cozy corner with\nhammock and books and the clean-linened table, showed the grace of a\ndaughter who lived for happiness and the day at hand.\n\nJane turned Lassiter's horse loose in the thick grass. \"You will want\nhim to be near you,\" she said, \"or I'd have him taken to the alfalfa\nfields.\" At her call appeared women who began at once to bustle about,\nhurrying to and fro, setting the table. Then Jane, excusing herself,\nwent within.\n\nShe passed through a huge low ceiled chamber, like the inside of a fort,\nand into a smaller one where a bright wood-fire blazed in an old open\nfireplace, and from this into her own room. It had the same comfort as\nwas manifested in the home-like outer court; moreover, it was warm and\nrich in soft hues.\n\nSeldom did Jane Withersteen enter her room without looking into her\nmirror. She knew she loved the reflection of that beauty which since\nearly childhood she had never been allowed to forget. Her relatives and\nfriends, and later a horde of Mormon and Gentile suitors, had fanned\nthe flame of natural vanity in her. So that at twenty-eight she scarcely\nthought at all of her wonderful influence for good in the little\ncommunity where her father had left her practically its beneficent\nlandlord, but cared most for the dream and the assurance and the\nallurement of her beauty. This time, however, she gazed into her\nglass with more than the usual happy motive, without the usual slight\nconscious smile. For she was thinking of more than the desire to be fair\nin her own eyes, in those of her friend; she wondered if she were to\nseem fair in the eyes of this Lassiter, this man whose name had crossed\nthe long, wild brakes of stone and plains of sage, this gentle-voiced,\nsad-faced man who was a hater and a killer of Mormons. It was not\nnow her usual half-conscious vain obsession that actuated her as she\nhurriedly changed her riding-dress to one of white, and then looked long\nat the stately form with its gracious contours, at the fair face\nwith its strong chin and full firm lips, at the dark-blue, proud, and\npassionate eyes.\n\n\"If by some means I can keep him here a few days, a week--he will never\nkill another Mormon,\" she mused. \"Lassiter!... I shudder when I think\nof that name, of him. But when I look at the man I forget who he is--I\nalmost like him. I remember only that he saved Bern. He has suffered. I\nwonder what it was--did he love a Mormon woman once? How splendidly he\nchampioned us poor misunderstood souls! Somehow he knows--much.\"\n\nJane Withersteen joined her guests and bade them to her board.\nDismissing her woman, she waited upon them with her own hands. It was a\nbountiful supper and a strange company. On her right sat the ragged\nand half-starved Venters; and though blind eyes could have seen what\nhe counted for in the sum of her happiness, yet he looked the gloomy\noutcast his allegiance had made him, and about him there was the shadow\nof the ruin presaged by Tull. On her left sat black-leather-garbed\nLassiter looking like a man in a dream. Hunger was not with him, nor\ncomposure, nor speech, and when he twisted in frequent unquiet movements\nthe heavy guns that he had not removed knocked against the table-legs.\nIf it had been otherwise possible to forget the presence of Lassiter\nthose telling little jars would have rendered it unlikely. And Jane\nWithersteen talked and smiled and laughed with all the dazzling play\nof lips and eyes that a beautiful, daring woman could summon to her\npurpose.\n\nWhen the meal ended, and the men pushed back their chairs, she leaned\ncloser to Lassiter and looked square into his eyes.\n\n\"Why did you come to Cottonwoods?\"\n\nHer question seemed to break a spell. The rider arose as if he had just\nremembered himself and had tarried longer than his wont.\n\n\"Ma'am, I have hunted all over the southern Utah and Nevada\nfor--somethin'. An' through your name I learned where to find it--here\nin Cottonwoods.\"\n\n\"My name! Oh, I remember. You did know my name when you spoke first.\nWell, tell me where you heard it and from whom?\"\n\n\"At the little village--Glaze, I think it's called--some fifty miles or\nmore west of here. An' I heard it from a Gentile, a rider who said you'd\nknow where to tell me to find--\"\n\n\"What?\" she demanded, imperiously, as Lassiter broke off.\n\n\"Milly Erne's grave,\" he answered low, and the words came with a wrench.\n\nVenters wheeled in his chair to regard Lassiter in amazement, and Jane\nslowly raised herself in white, still wonder.\n\n\"Milly Erne's grave?\" she echoed, in a whisper. \"What do you know of\nMilly Erne, my best-beloved friend--who died in my arms? What were you\nto her?\"\n\n\"Did I claim to be anythin'?\" he inquired. \"I know\npeople--relatives--who have long wanted to know where she's buried,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Relatives? She never spoke of relatives, except a brother who was shot\nin Texas. Lassiter, Milly Erne's grave is in a secret burying-ground on\nmy property.\"\n\n\"Will you take me there?... You'll be offendin' Mormons worse than by\nbreakin' bread with me.\"\n\n\"Indeed yes, but I'll do it. Only we must go unseen. To-morrow,\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Jane Withersteen,\" replied the rider, and he bowed to her\nand stepped backward out of the court.\n\n\"Will you not stay--sleep under my roof?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, ma'am, an' thanks again. I never sleep indoors. An' even if I did\nthere's that gatherin' storm in the village below. No, no. I'll go to\nthe sage. I hope you won't suffer none for your kindness to me.\"\n\n\"Lassiter,\" said Venters, with a half-bitter laugh, \"my bed too, is the\nsage. Perhaps we may meet out there.\"\n\n\"Mebbe so. But the sage is wide an' I won't be near. Good night.\"\n\nAt Lassiter's low whistle the black horse whinnied, and carefully picked\nhis blind way out of the grove. The rider did not bridle him, but walked\nbeside him, leading him by touch of hand and together they passed slowly\ninto the shade of the cottonwoods.\n\n\"Jane, I must be off soon,\" said Venters. \"Give me my guns. If I'd had\nmy guns--\"\n\n\"Either my friend or the Elder of my church would be lying dead,\" she\ninterposed.\n\n\"Tull would be--surely.\"\n\n\"Oh, you fierce-blooded, savage youth! Can't I teach you forebearance,\nmercy? Bern, it's divine to forgive your enemies. 'Let not the sun go\ndown upon thy wrath.'\"\n\n\"Hush! Talk to me no more of mercy or religion--after to-day. To-day\nthis strange coming of Lassiter left me still a man, and now I'll die a\nman!... Give me my guns.\"\n\nSilently she went into the house, to return with a heavy cartridge-belt\nand gun-filled sheath and a long rifle; these she handed to him, and as\nhe buckled on the belt she stood before him in silent eloquence.\n\n\"Jane,\" he said, in gentler voice, \"don't look so. I'm not going out to\nmurder your churchman. I'll try to avoid him and all his men. But can't\nyou see I've reached the end of my rope? Jane, you're a wonderful woman.\nNever was there a woman so unselfish and good. Only you're blind in one\nway.... Listen!\"\n\nFrom behind the grove came the clicking sound of horses in a rapid trot.\n\n\"Some of your riders,\" he continued. \"It's getting time for the night\nshift. Let us go out to the bench in the grove and talk there.\"\n\nIt was still daylight in the open, but under the spreading cottonwoods\nshadows were obscuring the lanes. Venters drew Jane off from one of\nthese into a shrub-lined trail, just wide enough for the two to walk\nabreast, and in a roundabout way led her far from the house to a knoll\non the edge of the grove. Here in a secluded nook was a bench from\nwhich, through an opening in the tree-tops, could be seen the sage-slope\nand the wall of rock and the dim lines of canyons. Jane had not spoken\nsince Venters had shocked her with his first harsh speech; but all the\nway she had clung to his arm, and now, as he stopped and laid his rifle\nagainst the bench, she still clung to him.\n\n\"Jane, I'm afraid I must leave you.\"\n\n\"Bern!\" she cried.\n\n\"Yes, it looks that way. My position is not a happy one--I can't feel\nright--I've lost all--\"\n\n\"I'll give you anything you--\"\n\n\"Listen, please. When I say loss I don't mean what you think. I mean\nloss of good-will, good name--that which would have enabled me to stand\nup in this village without bitterness. Well, it's too late.... Now, as to\nthe future, I think you'd do best to give me up. Tull is implacable.\nYou ought to see from his intention to-day that--But you can't see. Your\nblindness--your damned religion!... Jane, forgive me--I'm sore within and\nsomething rankles. Well, I fear that invisible hand will turn its hidden\nwork to your ruin.\"\n\n\"Invisible hand? Bern!\"\n\n\"I mean your Bishop.\" Venters said it deliberately and would not release\nher as she started back. \"He's the law. The edict went forth to ruin me.\nWell, look at me! It'll now go forth to compel you to the will of the\nChurch.\"\n\n\"You wrong Bishop Dyer. Tull is hard, I know. But then he has been in\nlove with me for years.\"\n\n\"Oh, your faith and your excuses! You can't see what I know--and if you\ndid see it you'd not admit it to save your life. That's the Mormon\nof you. These elders and bishops will do absolutely any deed to go on\nbuilding up the power and wealth of their church, their empire. Think\nof what they've done to the Gentiles here, to me--think of Milly Erne's\nfate!\"\n\n\"What do you know of her story?\"\n\n\"I know enough--all, perhaps, except the name of the Mormon who brought\nher here. But I must stop this kind of talk.\"\n\nShe pressed his hand in response. He helped her to a seat beside him\non the bench. And he respected a silence that he divined was full of\nwoman's deep emotion beyond his understanding.\n\nIt was the moment when the last ruddy rays of the sunset brightened\nmomentarily before yielding to twilight. And for Venters the outlook\nbefore him was in some sense similar to a feeling of his future, and\nwith searching eyes he studied the beautiful purple, barren waste of\nsage. Here was the unknown and the perilous. The whole scene impressed\nVenters as a wild, austere, and mighty manifestation of nature. And\nas it somehow reminded him of his prospect in life, so it suddenly\nresembled the woman near him, only in her there were greater beauty and\nperil, a mystery more unsolvable, and something nameless that numbed his\nheart and dimmed his eye.\n\n\"Look! A rider!\" exclaimed Jane, breaking the silence. \"Can that be\nLassiter?\"\n\nVenters moved his glance once more to the west. A horseman showed dark\non the sky-line, then merged into the color of the sage.\n\n\"It might be. But I think not--that fellow was coming in. One of your\nriders, more likely. Yes, I see him clearly now. And there's another.\"\n\n\"I see them, too.\"\n\n\"Jane, your riders seem as many as the bunches of sage. I ran into five\nyesterday 'way down near the trail to Deception Pass. They were with the\nwhite herd.\"\n\n\"You still go to that canyon? Bern, I wish you wouldn't. Oldring and his\nrustlers live somewhere down there.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?\"\n\n\"Tull has already hinted to your frequent trips into Deception Pass.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Venters uttered a short laugh. \"He'll make a rustler of me\nnext. But, Jane, there's no water for fifty miles after I leave here,\nand the nearest is in the canyon. I must drink and water my horse.\nThere! I see more riders. They are going out.\"\n\n\"The red herd is on the slope, toward the Pass.\"\n\nTwilight was fast falling. A group of horsemen crossed the dark line\nof low ground to become more distinct as they climbed the slope. The\nsilence broke to a clear call from an incoming rider, and, almost like\nthe peal of a hunting-horn, floated back the answer. The outgoing riders\nmoved swiftly, came sharply into sight as they topped a ridge to show\nwild and black above the horizon, and then passed down, dimming into the\npurple of the sage.\n\n\"I hope they don't meet Lassiter,\" said Jane.\n\n\"So do I,\" replied Venters. \"By this time the riders of the night shift\nknow what happened to-day. But Lassiter will likely keep out of their\nway.\"\n\n\"Bern, who is Lassiter? He's only a name to me--a terrible name.\"\n\n\"Who is he? I don't know, Jane. Nobody I ever met knows him. He talks a\nlittle like a Texan, like Milly Erne. Did you note that?\"\n\n\"Yes. How strange of him to know of her! And she lived here ten years\nand has been dead two. Bern, what do you know of Lassiter? Tell me what\nhe has done--why you spoke of him to Tull--threatening to become another\nLassiter yourself?\"\n\n\"Jane, I only heard things, rumors, stories, most of which I\ndisbelieved. At Glaze his name was known, but none of the riders or\nranchers I knew there ever met him. At Stone Bridge I never heard him\nmentioned. But at Sterling and villages north of there he was spoken of\noften. I've never been in a village which he had been known to visit.\nThere were many conflicting stories about him and his doings. Some said\nhe had shot up this and that Mormon village, and others denied it. I'm\ninclined to believe he has, and you know how Mormons hide the truth. But\nthere was one feature about Lassiter upon which all agree--that he was\nwhat riders in this country call a gun-man. He's a man with a marvelous\nquickness and accuracy in the use of a Colt. And now that I've seen him\nI know more. Lassiter was born without fear. I watched him with eyes\nwhich saw him my friend. I'll never forget the moment I recognized him\nfrom what had been told me of his crouch before the draw. It was then I\nyelled his name. I believe that yell saved Tull's life. At any rate, I\nknow this, between Tull and death then there was not the breadth of the\nlittlest hair. If he or any of his men had moved a finger downward--\"\n\nVenters left his meaning unspoken, but at the suggestion Jane shuddered.\n\nThe pale afterglow in the west darkened with the merging of twilight\ninto night. The sage now spread out black and gloomy. One dim star\nglimmered in the southwest sky. The sound of trotting horses had\nceased, and there was silence broken only by a faint, dry pattering of\ncottonwood leaves in the soft night wind.\n\nInto this peace and calm suddenly broke the high-keyed yelp of a coyote,\nand from far off in the darkness came the faint answering note of a\ntrailing mate.\n\n\"Hello! the sage-dogs are barking,\" said Venters.\n\n\"I don't like to hear them,\" replied Jane. \"At night, sometimes when I\nlie awake, listening to the long mourn or breaking bark or wild howl, I\nthink of you asleep somewhere in the sage, and my heart aches.\"\n\n\"Jane, you couldn't listen to sweeter music, nor could I have a better\nbed.\"\n\n\"Just think! Men like Lassiter and you have no home, no comfort, no\nrest, no place to lay your weary heads. Well!... Let us be patient.\nTull's anger may cool, and time may help us. You might do some service\nto the village--who can tell? Suppose you discovered the long-unknown\nhiding-place of Oldring and his band, and told it to my riders? That\nwould disarm Tull's ugly hints and put you in favor. For years my riders\nhave trailed the tracks of stolen cattle. You know as well as I how\ndearly we've paid for our ranges in this wild country. Oldring drives\nour cattle down into the network of deceiving canyons, and somewhere far\nto the north or east he drives them up and out to Utah markets. If you\nwill spend time in Deception Pass try to find the trails.\"\n\n\"Jane, I've thought of that. I'll try.\"\n\n\"I must go now. And it hurts, for now I'll never be sure of seeing you\nagain. But to-morrow, Bern?\"\n\n\"To-morrow surely. I'll watch for Lassiter and ride in with him.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nThen she left him and moved away, a white, gliding shape that soon\nvanished in the shadows.\n\nVenters waited until the faint slam of a door assured him she had\nreached the house, and then, taking up his rifle, he noiselessly slipped\nthrough the bushes, down the knoll, and on under the dark trees to the\nedge of the grove. The sky was now turning from gray to blue; stars had\nbegun to lighten the earlier blackness; and from the wide flat sweep\nbefore him blew a cool wind, fragrant with the breath of sage. Keeping\nclose to the edge of the cottonwoods, he went swiftly and silently\nwestward. The grove was long, and he had not reached the end when he\nheard something that brought him to a halt. Low padded thuds told\nhim horses were coming this way. He sank down in the gloom, waiting,\nlistening. Much before he had expected, judging from sound, to his\namazement he descried horsemen near at hand. They were riding along the\nborder of the sage, and instantly he knew the hoofs of the horses were\nmuffled. Then the pale starlight afforded him indistinct sight of the\nriders. But his eyes were keen and used to the dark, and by peering\nclosely he recognized the huge bulk and black-bearded visage of Oldring\nand the lithe, supple form of the rustler's lieutenant, a masked rider.\nThey passed on; the darkness swallowed them. Then, farther out on the\nsage, a dark, compact body of horsemen went by, almost without sound,\nalmost like specters, and they, too, melted into the night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. AMBER SPRING\n\nNo unusual circumstances was it for Oldring and some of his men to visit\nCottonwoods in the broad light of day, but for him to prowl about in\nthe dark with the hoofs of his horses muffled meant that mischief was\nbrewing. Moreover, to Venters the presence of the masked rider with\nOldring seemed especially ominous. For about this man there was mystery,\nhe seldom rode through the village, and when he did ride through it\nwas swiftly; riders seldom met by day on the sage, but wherever he rode\nthere always followed deeds as dark and mysterious as the mask he wore.\nOldring's band did not confine themselves to the rustling of cattle.\n\nVenters lay low in the shade of the cottonwoods, pondering this chance\nmeeting, and not for many moments did he consider it safe to move on.\nThen, with sudden impulse, he turned the other way and went back along\nthe grove. When he reached the path leading to Jane's home he decided\nto go down to the village. So he hurried onward, with quick soft steps.\nOnce beyond the grove he entered the one and only street. It was\nwide, lined with tall poplars, and under each row of trees, inside the\nfoot-path, were ditches where ran the water from Jane Withersteen's\nspring.\n\nBetween the trees twinkled lights of cottage candles, and far down\nflared bright windows of the village stores. When Venters got closer to\nthese he saw knots of men standing together in earnest conversation. The\nusual lounging on the corners and benches and steps was not in evidence.\nKeeping in the shadow Venters went closer and closer until he could hear\nvoices. But he could not distinguish what was said. He recognized many\nMormons, and looked hard for Tull and his men, but looked in vain.\nVenters concluded that the rustlers had not passed along the village\nstreet. No doubt these earnest men were discussing Lassiter's coming.\nBut Venters felt positive that Tull's intention toward himself that day\nhad not been and would not be revealed.\n\nSo Venters, seeing there was little for him to learn, began retracing\nhis steps. The church was dark, Bishop Dyer's home next to it was also\ndark, and likewise Tull's cottage. Upon almost any night at this hour\nthere would be lights here, and Venters marked the unusual omission.\n\nAs he was about to pass out of the street to skirt the grove, he once\nmore slunk down at the sound of trotting horses. Presently he descried\ntwo mounted men riding toward him. He hugged the shadow of a tree. Again\nthe starlight, brighter now, aided him, and he made out Tull's stalwart\nfigure, and beside him the short, froglike shape of the rider Jerry.\nThey were silent, and they rode on to disappear.\n\nVenters went his way with busy, gloomy mind, revolving events of\nthe day, trying to reckon those brooding in the night. His thoughts\noverwhelmed him. Up in that dark grove dwelt a woman who had been his\nfriend. And he skulked about her home, gripping a gun stealthily as an\nIndian, a man without place or people or purpose. Above her hovered the\nshadow of grim, hidden, secret power. No queen could have given more\nroyally out of a bounteous store than Jane Withersteen gave her people,\nand likewise to those unfortunates whom her people hated. She asked only\nthe divine right of all women--freedom; to love and to live as her heart\nwilled. And yet prayer and her hope were vain.\n\n\"For years I've seen a storm clouding over her and the village of\nCottonwoods,\" muttered Venters, as he strode on. \"Soon it'll burst. I\ndon't like the prospects.\" That night the villagers whispered in the\nstreet--and night-riding rustlers muffled horses--and Tull was at work\nin secret--and out there in the sage hid a man who meant something\nterrible--Lassiter!\n\nVenters passed the black cottonwoods, and, entering the sage, climbed\nthe gradual slope. He kept his direction in line with a western star.\nFrom time to time he stopped to listen and heard only the usual familiar\nbark of coyote and sweep of wind and rustle of sage. Presently a low\njumble of rocks loomed up darkly somewhat to his right, and, turning\nthat way, he whistled softly. Out of the rocks glided a dog that leaped\nand whined about him. He climbed over rough, broken rock, picking his\nway carefully, and then went down. Here it was darker, and sheltered\nfrom the wind. A white object guided him. It was another dog, and this\none was asleep, curled up between a saddle and a pack. The animal\nawoke and thumped his tail in greeting. Venters placed the saddle for a\npillow, rolled in his blankets, with his face upward to the stars. The\nwhite dog snuggled close to him. The other whined and pattered a few\nyards to the rise of ground and there crouched on guard. And in that\nwild covert Venters shut his eyes under the great white stars and\nintense vaulted blue, bitterly comparing their loneliness to his own,\nand fell asleep.\n\nWhen he awoke, day had dawned and all about him was bright steel-gray.\nThe air had a cold tang. Arising, he greeted the fawning dogs and\nstretched his cramped body, and then, gathering together bunches of dead\nsage sticks, he lighted a fire. Strips of dried beef held to the blaze\nfor a moment served him and the dogs. He drank from a canteen. There was\nnothing else in his outfit; he had grown used to a scant fire. Then he\nsat over the fire, palms outspread, and waited. Waiting had been his\nchief occupation for months, and he scarcely knew what he waited for\nunless it was the passing of the hours. But now he sensed action in the\nimmediate present; the day promised another meeting with Lassiter and\nJane, perhaps news of the rustlers; on the morrow he meant to take the\ntrail to Deception Pass.\n\nAnd while he waited he talked to his dogs. He called them Ring and\nWhitie; they were sheep-dogs, half collie, half deerhound, superb in\nbuild, perfectly trained. It seemed that in his fallen fortunes these\ndogs understood the nature of their value to him, and governed their\naffection and faithfulness accordingly. Whitie watched him with somber\neyes of love, and Ring, crouched on the little rise of ground above,\nkept tireless guard. When the sun rose, the white dog took the place of\nthe other, and Ring went to sleep at his master's feet.\n\nBy and by Venters rolled up his blankets and tied them and his meager\npack together, then climbed out to look for his horse. He saw him,\npresently, a little way off in the sage, and went to fetch him. In that\ncountry, where every rider boasted of a fine mount and was eager for a\nrace, where thoroughbreds dotted the wonderful grazing ranges, Venters\nrode a horse that was sad proof of his misfortunes.\n\nThen, with his back against a stone, Venters faced the east, and, stick\nin hand and idle blade, he waited. The glorious sunlight filled the\nvalley with purple fire. Before him, to left, to right, waving, rolling,\nsinking, rising, like low swells of a purple sea, stretched the sage.\nOut of the grove of cottonwoods, a green patch on the purple, gleamed\nthe dull red of Jane Withersteen's old stone house. And from there\nextended the wide green of the village gardens and orchards marked by\nthe graceful poplars; and farther down shone the deep, dark richness of\nthe alfalfa fields. Numberless red and black and white dots speckled the\nsage, and these were cattle and horses.\n\nSo, watching and waiting, Venters let the time wear away. At length he\nsaw a horse rise above a ridge, and he knew it to be Lassiter's\nblack. Climbing to the highest rock, so that he would show against the\nsky-line, he stood and waved his hat. The almost instant turning of\nLassiter's horse attested to the quickness of that rider's eye. Then\nVenters climbed down, saddled his horse, tied on his pack, and, with\na word to his dogs, was about to ride out to meet Lassiter, when he\nconcluded to wait for him there, on higher ground, where the outlook was\ncommanding.\n\nIt had been long since Venters had experienced friendly greeting from\na man. Lassiter's warmed in him something that had grown cold from\nneglect. And when he had returned it, with a strong grip of the iron\nhand that held his, and met the gray eyes, he knew that Lassiter and he\nwere to be friends.\n\n\"Venters, let's talk awhile before we go down there,\" said Lassiter,\nslipping his bridle. \"I ain't in no hurry. Them's sure fine dogs you've\ngot.\" With a rider's eye he took in the points of Venter's horse, but\ndid not speak his thought. \"Well, did anythin' come off after I left you\nlast night?\"\n\nVenters told him about the rustlers.\n\n\"I was snug hid in the sage,\" replied Lassiter, \"an' didn't see or hear\nno one. Oldrin's got a high hand here, I reckon. It's no news up in\nUtah how he holes in canyons an' leaves no track.\" Lassiter was silent a\nmoment. \"Me an' Oldrin' wasn't exactly strangers some years back when he\ndrove cattle into Bostil's Ford, at the head of the Rio Virgin. But he\ngot harassed there an' now he drives some place else.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, you knew him? Tell me, is he Mormon or Gentile?\"\n\n\"I can't say. I've knowed Mormons who pretended to be Gentiles.\"\n\n\"No Mormon ever pretended that unless he was a rustler,\" declared\nVenters.\n\n\"Mebbe so.\"\n\n\"It's a hard country for any one, but hardest for Gentiles. Did you ever\nknow or hear of a Gentile prospering in a Mormon community?\"\n\n\"I never did.\"\n\n\"Well, I want to get out of Utah. I've a mother living in Illinois. I\nwant to go home. It's eight years now.\"\n\nThe older man's sympathy moved Venters to tell his story. He had left\nQuincy, run off to seek his fortune in the gold fields had never gotten\nany farther than Salt Lake City, wandered here and there as helper,\nteamster, shepherd, and drifted southward over the divide and across the\nbarrens and up the rugged plateau through the passes to the last border\nsettlements. Here he became a rider of the sage, had stock of his own,\nand for a time prospered, until chance threw him in the employ of Jane\nWithersteen.\n\n\"Lassiter, I needn't tell you the rest.\"\n\n\"Well, it'd be no news to me. I know Mormons. I've seen their women's\nstrange love en' patience en' sacrifice an' silence en' whet I call\nmadness for their idea of God. An' over against that I've seen the\ntricks of men. They work hand in hand, all together, an' in the dark.\nNo man can hold out against them, unless he takes to packin' guns. For\nMormons are slow to kill. That's the only good I ever seen in their\nreligion. Venters, take this from me, these Mormons ain't just right in\ntheir minds. Else could a Mormon marry one woman when he already has a\nwife, an' call it duty?\"\n\n\"Lassiter, you think as I think,\" returned Venters.\n\n\"How'd it come then that you never throwed a gun on Tull or some of\nthem?\" inquired the rider, curiously.\n\n\"Jane pleaded with me, begged me to be patient, to overlook. She even\ntook my guns from me. I lost all before I knew it,\" replied Venters,\nwith the red color in his face. \"But, Lassiter, listen. Out of the\nwreck I saved a Winchester, two Colts, and plenty of shells. I packed\nthese down into Deception Pass. There, almost every day for six months,\nI have practiced with my rifle till the barrel burnt my hands. Practised\nthe draw--the firing of a Colt, hour after hour!\"\n\n\"Now that's interestin' to me,\" said Lassiter, with a quick uplift of\nhis head and a concentration of his gray gaze on Venters. \"Could you\nthrow a gun before you began that practisin'?\"\n\n\"Yes. And now...\" Venters made a lightning-swift movement.\n\nLassiter smiled, and then his bronzed eyelids narrowed till his eyes\nseemed mere gray slits. \"You'll kill Tull!\" He did not question; he\naffirmed.\n\n\"I promised Jane Withersteen I'd try to avoid Tull. I'll keep my word.\nBut sooner or later Tull and I will meet. As I feel now, if he even\nlooks at me I'll draw!\"\n\n\"I reckon so. There'll be hell down there, presently.\" He paused a\nmoment and flicked a sage-brush with his quirt. \"Venters, seein' as\nyou're considerable worked up, tell me Milly Erne's story.\"\n\nVenters's agitation stilled to the trace of suppressed eagerness in\nLassiter's query.\n\n\"Milly Erne's story? Well, Lassiter, I'll tell you what I know. Milly\nErne had been in Cottonwoods years when I first arrived there, and most\nof what I tell you happened before my arrival. I got to know her pretty\nwell. She was a slip of a woman, and crazy on religion. I conceived an\nidea that I never mentioned--I thought she was at heart more Gentile\nthan Mormon. But she passed as a Mormon, and certainly she had the\nMormon woman's locked lips. You know, in every Mormon village there are\nwomen who seem mysterious to us, but about Milly there was more than\nthe ordinary mystery. When she came to Cottonwoods she had a beautiful\nlittle girl whom she loved passionately. Milly was not known openly in\nCottonwoods as a Mormon wife. That she really was a Mormon wife I have\nno doubt. Perhaps the Mormon's other wife or wives would not acknowledge\nMilly. Such things happen in these villages. Mormon wives wear\nyokes, but they get jealous. Well, whatever had brought Milly to this\ncountry--love or madness of religion--she repented of it. She gave up\nteaching the village school. She quit the church. And she began to\nfight Mormon upbringing for her baby girl. Then the Mormons put on the\nscrews--slowly, as is their way. At last the child disappeared. 'Lost'\nwas the report. The child was stolen, I know that. So do you. That\nwrecked Milly Erne. But she lived on in hope. She became a slave. She\nworked her heart and soul and life out to get back her child. She never\nheard of it again. Then she sank.... I can see her now, a frail thing, so\ntransparent you could almost look through her--white like ashes--and her\neyes!... Her eyes have always haunted me. She had one real friend--Jane\nWithersteen. But Jane couldn't mend a broken heart, and Milly died.\"\n\nFor moments Lassiter did not speak, or turn his head.\n\n\"The man!\" he exclaimed, presently, in husky accents.\n\n\"I haven't the slightest idea who the Mormon was,\" replied Venters; \"nor\nhas any Gentile in Cottonwoods.\"\n\n\"Does Jane Withersteen know?\"\n\n\"Yes. But a red-hot running-iron couldn't burn that name out of her!\"\n\nWithout further speech Lassiter started off, walking his horse and\nVenters followed with his dogs. Half a mile down the slope they entered\na luxuriant growth of willows, and soon came into an open space carpeted\nwith grass like deep green velvet. The rushing of water and singing of\nbirds filled their ears. Venters led his comrade to a shady bower and\nshowed him Amber Spring. It was a magnificent outburst of clear, amber\nwater pouring from a dark, stone-lined hole. Lassiter knelt and drank,\nlingered there to drink again. He made no comment, but Venters did not\nneed words. Next to his horse a rider of the sage loved a spring. And\nthis spring was the most beautiful and remarkable known to the upland\nriders of southern Utah. It was the spring that made old Withersteen a\nfeudal lord and now enabled his daughter to return the toll which her\nfather had exacted from the toilers of the sage.\n\nThe spring gushed forth in a swirling torrent, and leaped down joyously\nto make its swift way along a willow-skirted channel. Moss and ferns and\nlilies overhung its green banks. Except for the rough-hewn stones that\nheld and directed the water, this willow thicket and glade had been left\nas nature had made it.\n\nBelow were artificial lakes, three in number, one above the other\nin banks of raised earth, and round about them rose the lofty\ngreen-foliaged shafts of poplar trees. Ducks dotted the glassy surface\nof the lakes; a blue heron stood motionless on a water-gate; kingfishers\ndarted with shrieking flight along the shady banks; a white hawk\nsailed above; and from the trees and shrubs came the song of robins\nand cat-birds. It was all in strange contrast to the endless slopes of\nlonely sage and the wild rock environs beyond. Venters thought of the\nwoman who loved the birds and the green of the leaves and the murmur of\nthe water.\n\nNext on the slope, just below the third and largest lake, were corrals\nand a wide stone barn and open sheds and coops and pens. Here were\nclouds of dust, and cracking sounds of hoofs, and romping colts and\nheehawing burros. Neighing horses trampled to the corral fences. And\non the little windows of the barn projected bobbing heads of bays and\nblacks and sorrels. When the two men entered the immense barnyard, from\nall around the din increased. This welcome, however, was not seconded by\nthe several men and boys who vanished on sight.\n\nVenters and Lassiter were turning toward the house when Jane appeared in\nthe lane leading a horse. In riding-skirt and blouse she seemed to have\nlost some of her statuesque proportions, and looked more like a girl\nrider than the mistress of Withersteen. She was brightly smiling, and\nher greeting was warmly cordial.\n\n\"Good news,\" she announced. \"I've been to the village. All is quiet.\nI expected--I don't know what. But there's no excitement. And Tull has\nridden out on his way to Glaze.\"\n\n\"Tull gone?\" inquired Venters, with surprise. He was wondering what\ncould have taken Tull away. Was it to avoid another meeting with\nLassiter that he went? Could it have any connection with the probable\nnearness of Oldring and his gang?\n\n\"Gone, yes, thank goodness,\" replied Jane. \"Now I'll have peace for a\nwhile. Lassiter, I want you to see my horses. You are a rider, and\nyou must be a judge of horseflesh. Some of mine have Arabian blood.\nMy father got his best strain in Nevada from Indians who claimed their\nhorses were bred down from the original stock left by the Spaniards.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, the one you've been ridin' takes my eye,\" said Lassiter,\nas he walked round the racy, clean-limbed, and fine-pointed roan.\n\n\"Where are the boys?\" she asked, looking about. \"Jerd, Paul, where are\nyou? Here, bring out the horses.\"\n\nThe sound of dropping bars inside the barn was the signal for the horses\nto jerk their heads in the windows, to snort and stamp. Then they came\npounding out of the door, a file of thoroughbreds, to plunge about\nthe barnyard, heads and tails up, manes flying. They halted afar off,\nsquared away to look, came slowly forward with whinnies for their\nmistress, and doubtful snorts for the strangers and their horses.\n\n\"Come--come--come,\" called Jane, holding out her hands. \"Why,\nBells--Wrangle, where are your manners? Come, Black Star--come, Night.\nAh, you beauties! My racers of the sage!\"\n\nOnly two came up to her; those she called Night and Black Star. Venters\nnever looked at them without delight. The first was soft dead black, the\nother glittering black, and they were perfectly matched in size, both\nbeing high and long-bodied, wide through the shoulders, with lithe,\npowerful legs. That they were a woman's pets showed in the gloss of\nskin, the fineness of mane. It showed, too, in the light of big eyes and\nthe gentle reach of eagerness.\n\n\"I never seen their like,\" was Lassiter's encomium, \"an' in my day I've\nseen a sight of horses. Now, ma'am, if you was wantin' to make a long\nan' fast ride across the sage--say to elope--\"\n\nLassiter ended there with dry humor, yet behind that was meaning. Jane\nblushed and made arch eyes at him.\n\n\"Take care, Lassiter, I might think that a proposal,\" she replied,\ngaily. \"It's dangerous to propose elopement to a Mormon woman. Well,\nI was expecting you. Now will be a good hour to show you Milly Erne's\ngrave. The day-riders have gone, and the night-riders haven't come in.\nBern, what do you make of that? Need I worry? You know I have to be made\nto worry.\"\n\n\"Well, it's not usual for the night shift to ride in so late,\" replied\nVenters, slowly, and his glance sought Lassiter's. \"Cattle are usually\nquiet after dark. Still, I've known even a coyote to stampede your white\nherd.\"\n\n\"I refuse to borrow trouble. Come,\" said Jane.\n\nThey mounted, and, with Jane in the lead, rode down the lane, and,\nturning off into a cattle trail, proceeded westward. Venters's dogs\ntrotted behind them. On this side of the ranch the outlook was different\nfrom that on the other; the immediate foreground was rough and the sage\nmore rugged and less colorful; there were no dark-blue lines of canyons\nto hold the eye, nor any uprearing rock walls. It was a long roll and\nslope into gray obscurity. Soon Jane left the trail and rode into the\nsage, and presently she dismounted and threw her bridle. The men did\nlikewise. Then, on foot, they followed her, coming out at length on the\nrim of a low escarpment. She passed by several little ridges of earth to\nhalt before a faintly defined mound. It lay in the shade of a sweeping\nsage-brush close to the edge of the promontory; and a rider could have\njumped his horse over it without recognizing a grave.\n\n\"Here!\"\n\nShe looked sad as she spoke, but she offered no explanation for the\nneglect of an unmarked, uncared-for grave. There was a little bunch of\npale, sweet lavender daisies, doubtless planted there by Jane.\n\n\"I only come here to remember and to pray,\" she said. \"But I leave no\ntrail!\"\n\nA grave in the sage! How lonely this resting-place of Milly Erne! The\ncottonwoods or the alfalfa fields were not in sight, nor was there any\nrock or ridge or cedar to lend contrast to the monotony. Gray slopes,\ntinging the purple, barren and wild, with the wind waving the sage,\nswept away to the dim horizon.\n\nLassiter looked at the grave and then out into space. At that moment he\nseemed a figure of bronze.\n\nJane touched Venters's arm and led him back to the horses.\n\n\"Bern!\" cried Jane, when they were out of hearing. \"Suppose Lassiter\nwere Milly's husband--the father of that little girl lost so long ago!\"\n\n\"It might be, Jane. Let us ride on. If he wants to see us again he'll\ncome.\"\n\nSo they mounted and rode out to the cattle trail and began to climb.\nFrom the height of the ridge, where they had started down, Venters\nlooked back. He did not see Lassiter, but his glance, drawn irresistibly\nfarther out on the gradual slope, caught sight of a moving cloud of\ndust.\n\n\"Hello, a rider!\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Jane.\n\n\"That fellow's riding hard. Jane, there's something wrong.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, there must be.... How he rides!\"\n\nThe horse disappeared in the sage, and then puffs of dust marked his\ncourse.\n\n\"He's short-cut on us--he's making straight for the corrals.\"\n\nVenters and Jane galloped their steeds and reined in at the turning of\nthe lane. This lane led down to the right of the grove. Suddenly into\nits lower entrance flashed a bay horse. Then Venters caught the fast\nrhythmic beat of pounding hoofs. Soon his keen eye recognized the swing\nof the rider in his saddle.\n\n\"It's Judkins, your Gentile rider!\" he cried. \"Jane, when Judkins rides\nlike that it means hell!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. DECEPTION PASS\n\nThe rider thundered up and almost threw his foam-flecked horse in the\nsudden stop. He was a giant form, and with fearless eyes.\n\n\"Judkins, you're all bloody!\" cried Jane, in affright. \"Oh, you've been\nshot!\"\n\n\"Nothin' much Miss Withersteen. I got a nick in the shoulder. I'm some\nwet an' the hoss's been throwin' lather, so all this ain't blood.\"\n\n\"What's up?\" queried Venters, sharply.\n\n\"Rustlers sloped off with the red herd.\"\n\n\"Where are my riders?\" demanded Jane.\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, I was alone all night with the herd. At daylight this\nmornin' the rustlers rode down. They began to shoot at me on sight. They\nchased me hard an' far, burnin' powder all the time, but I got away.\"\n\n\"Jud, they meant to kill you,\" declared Venters.\n\n\"Now I wonder,\" returned Judkins. \"They wanted me bad. An' it ain't\nregular for rustlers to waste time chasin' one rider.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven you got away,\" said Jane. \"But my riders--where are they?\"\n\n\"I don't know. The night-riders weren't there last night when I rode\ndown, en' this mornin' I met no day-riders.\"\n\n\"Judkins! Bern, they've been set upon--killed by Oldring's men!\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" replied Venters, decidedly. \"Jane, your riders\nhaven't gone out in the sage.\"\n\n\"Bern, what do you mean?\" Jane Withersteen turned deathly pale.\n\n\"You remember what I said about the unseen hand?\"\n\n\"Oh!... Impossible!\"\n\n\"I hope so. But I fear--\" Venters finished, with a shake of his head.\n\n\"Bern, you're bitter; but that's only natural. We'll wait to see what's\nhappened to my riders. Judkins, come to the house with me. Your wound\nmust be attended to.\"\n\n\"Jane, I'll find out where Oldring drives the herd,\" vowed Venters.\n\n\"No, no! Bern, don't risk it now--when the rustlers are in such shooting\nmood.\"\n\n\"I'm going. Jud, how many cattle in that red herd?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five hundred head.\"\n\n\"Whew! What on earth can Oldring do with so many cattle? Why, a hundred\nhead is a big steal. I've got to find out.\"\n\n\"Don't go,\" implored Jane.\n\n\"Bern, you want a hoss thet can run. Miss Withersteen, if it's not too\nbold of me to advise, make him take a fast hoss or don't let him go.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Judkins. He must ride a horse that can't be caught. Which\none--Black Star--Night?\"\n\n\"Jane, I won't take either,\" said Venters, emphatically. \"I wouldn't\nrisk losing one of your favorites.\"\n\n\"Wrangle, then?\"\n\n\"Thet's the hoss,\" replied Judkins. \"Wrangle can outrun Black Star an'\nNight. You'd never believe it, Miss Withersteen, but I know. Wrangle's\nthe biggest en' fastest hoss on the sage.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Wrangle can't beat Black Star. But, Bern, take Wrangle if you\nwill go. Ask Jerd for anything you need. Oh, be watchful, careful.... God\nspeed you.\"\n\nShe clasped his hand, turned quickly away, and went down a lane with the\nrider.\n\nVenters rode to the barn, and, leaping off, shouted for Jerd. The boy\ncame running. Venters sent him for meat, bread, and dried fruits, to\nbe packed in saddlebags. His own horse he turned loose into the nearest\ncorral. Then he went for Wrangle. The giant sorrel had earned his name\nfor a trait the opposite of amiability. He came readily out of the barn,\nbut once in the yard he broke from Venters, and plunged about with ears\nlaid back. Venters had to rope him, and then he kicked down a section\nof fence, stood on his hind legs, crashed down and fought the rope. Jerd\nreturned to lend a hand.\n\n\"Wrangle don't git enough work,\" said Jerd, as the big saddle went on.\n\"He's unruly when he's corralled, an' wants to run. Wait till he smells\nthe sage!\"\n\n\"Jerd, this horse is an iron-jawed devil. I never straddled him but\nonce. Run? Say, he's swift as wind!\"\n\nWhen Venters's boot touched the stirrup the sorrel bolted, giving him\nthe rider's flying mount. The swing of this fiery horse recalled to\nVenters days that were not really long past, when he rode into the sage\nas the leader of Jane Withersteen's riders. Wrangle pulled hard on a\ntight rein. He galloped out of the lane, down the shady border of\nthe grove, and hauled up at the watering-trough, where he pranced and\nchamped his bit. Venters got off and filled his canteen while the horse\ndrank. The dogs, Ring and Whitie, came trotting up for their drink. Then\nVenters remounted and turned Wrangle toward the sage.\n\nA wide, white trail wound away down the slope. One keen, sweeping glance\ntold Venters that there was neither man nor horse nor steer within the\nlimit of his vision, unless they were lying down in the sage. Ring loped\nin the lead and Whitie loped in the rear. Wrangle settled gradually into\nan easy swinging canter, and Venters's thoughts, now that the rush and\nflurry of the start were past, and the long miles stretched before him,\nreverted to a calm reckoning of late singular coincidences.\n\nThere was the night ride of Tull's, which, viewed in the light of\nsubsequent events, had a look of his covert machinations; Oldring and\nhis Masked Rider and his rustlers riding muffled horses; the report\nthat Tull had ridden out that morning with his man Jerry on the trail\nto Glaze, the strange disappearance of Jane Withersteen's riders,\nthe unusually determined attempt to kill the one Gentile still in her\nemploy, an intention frustrated, no doubt, only by Judkin's magnificent\nriding of her racer, and lastly the driving of the red herd. These\nevents, to Venters's color of mind, had a dark relationship. Remembering\nJane's accusation of bitterness, he tried hard to put aside his rancor\nin judging Tull. But it was bitter knowledge that made him see the\ntruth. He had felt the shadow of an unseen hand; he had watched till he\nsaw its dim outline, and then he had traced it to a man's hate, to\nthe rivalry of a Mormon Elder, to the power of a Bishop, to the long,\nfar-reaching arm of a terrible creed. That unseen hand had made its\nfirst move against Jane Withersteen. Her riders had been called in,\nleaving her without help to drive seven thousand head of cattle. But to\nVenters it seemed extraordinary that the power which had called in these\nriders had left so many cattle to be driven by rustlers and harried by\nwolves. For hand in glove with that power was an insatiate greed; they\nwere one and the same.\n\n\"What can Oldring do with twenty-five hundred head of cattle?\" muttered\nVenters. \"Is he a Mormon? Did he meet Tull last night? It looks like\na black plot to me. But Tull and his churchmen wouldn't ruin Jane\nWithersteen unless the Church was to profit by that ruin. Where does\nOldring come in? I'm going to find out about these things.\"\n\nWrangle did the twenty-five miles in three hours and walked little of\nthe way. When he had gotten warmed up he had been allowed to choose his\nown gait. The afternoon had well advanced when Venters struck the trail\nof the red herd and found where it had grazed the night before. Then\nVenters rested the horse and used his eyes. Near at hand were a cow\nand a calf and several yearlings, and farther out in the sage some\nstraggling steers. He caught a glimpse of coyotes skulking near the\ncattle. The slow sweeping gaze of the rider failed to find other living\nthings within the field of sight. The sage about him was breast-high to\nhis horse, oversweet with its warm, fragrant breath, gray where it\nwaved to the light, darker where the wind left it still, and beyond the\nwonderful haze-purple lent by distance. Far across that wide waste began\nthe slow lift of uplands through which Deception Pass cut its tortuous\nmany-canyoned way.\n\nVenters raised the bridle of his horse and followed the broad cattle\ntrail. The crushed sage resembled the path of a monster snake. In a few\nmiles of travel he passed several cows and calves that had escaped the\ndrive. Then he stood on the last high bench of the slope with the floor\nof the valley beneath. The opening of the canyon showed in a break of\nthe sage, and the cattle trail paralleled it as far as he could see.\nThat trail led to an undiscovered point where Oldring drove cattle\ninto the pass, and many a rider who had followed it had never returned.\nVenters satisfied himself that the rustlers had not deviated from their\nusual course, and then he turned at right angles off the cattle trail\nand made for the head of the pass.\n\nThe sun lost its heat and wore down to the western horizon, where it\nchanged from white to gold and rested like a huge ball about to roll on\nits golden shadows down the slope. Venters watched the lengthening of\nthe rays and bars, and marveled at his own league-long shadow. The sun\nsank. There was instant shading of brightness about him, and he saw a\nkind of cold purple bloom creep ahead of him to cross the canyon, to\nmount the opposite slope and chase and darken and bury the last golden\nflare of sunlight.\n\nVenters rode into a trail that he always took to get down into the\ncanyon. He dismounted and found no tracks but his own made days\nprevious. Nevertheless he sent the dog Ring ahead and waited. In a\nlittle while Ring returned. Whereupon Venters led his horse on to the\nbreak in the ground.\n\nThe opening into Deception Pass was one of the remarkable natural\nphenomena in a country remarkable for vast slopes of sage, uplands\ninsulated by gigantic red walls, and deep canyons of mysterious source\nand outlet. Here the valley floor was level, and here opened a narrow\nchasm, a ragged vent in yellow walls of stone. The trail down the five\nhundred feet of sheer depth always tested Venters's nerve. It was\nbad going for even a burro. But Wrangle, as Venters led him, snorted\ndefiance or disgust rather than fear, and, like a hobbled horse on the\njump, lifted his ponderous iron-shod fore hoofs and crashed down over\nthe first rough step. Venters warmed to greater admiration of the\nsorrel; and, giving him a loose bridle, he stepped down foot by foot.\nOftentimes the stones and shale started by Wrangle buried Venters to\nhis knees; again he was hard put to it to dodge a rolling boulder, there\nwere times when he could not see Wrangle for dust, and once he and the\nhorse rode a sliding shelf of yellow, weathered cliff. It was a trail\non which there could be no stops, and, therefore, if perilous, it was at\nleast one that did not take long in the descent.\n\nVenters breathed lighter when that was over, and felt a sudden assurance\nin the success of his enterprise. For at first it had been a reckless\ndetermination to achieve something at any cost, and now it resolved\nitself into an adventure worthy of all his reason and cunning, and\nkeenness of eye and ear.\n\nPinyon pines clustered in little clumps along the level floor of the\npass. Twilight had gathered under the walls. Venters rode into the trail\nand up the canyon. Gradually the trees and caves and objects low down\nturned black, and this blackness moved up the walls till night enfolded\nthe pass, while day still lingered above. The sky darkened; and stars\nbegan to show, at first pale and then bright. Sharp notches of the\nrim-wall, biting like teeth into the blue, were landmarks by which\nVenters knew where his camping site lay. He had to feel his way through\na thicket of slender oaks to a spring where he watered Wrangle and drank\nhimself. Here he unsaddled and turned Wrangle loose, having no fear that\nthe horse would leave the thick, cool grass adjacent to the spring. Next\nhe satisfied his own hunger, fed Ring and Whitie and, with them curled\nbeside him, composed himself to await sleep.\n\nThere had been a time when night in the high altitude of these Utah\nuplands had been satisfying to Venters. But that was before the\noppression of enemies had made the change in his mind. As a rider\nguarding the herd he had never thought of the night's wildness and\nloneliness; as an outcast, now when the full silence set in, and the\ndeep darkness, and trains of radiant stars shone cold and calm, he\nlay with an ache in his heart. For a year he had lived as a black fox,\ndriven from his kind. He longed for the sound of a voice, the touch of\na hand. In the daytime there was riding from place to place, and the\ngun practice to which something drove him, and other tasks that at least\nnecessitated action, at night, before he won sleep, there was strife in\nhis soul. He yearned to leave the endless sage slopes, the wilderness\nof canyons, and it was in the lonely night that this yearning grew\nunbearable. It was then that he reached forth to feel Ring or Whitie,\nimmeasurably grateful for the love and companionship of two dogs.\n\nOn this night the same old loneliness beset Venters, the old habit\nof sad thought and burning unquiet had its way. But from it evolved a\nconviction that his useless life had undergone a subtle change. He had\nsensed it first when Wrangle swung him up to the high saddle, he knew\nit now when he lay in the gateway of Deception Pass. He had no thrill of\nadventure, rather a gloomy perception of great hazard, perhaps death. He\nmeant to find Oldring's retreat. The rustlers had fast horses, but none\nthat could catch Wrangle. Venters knew no rustler could creep upon him\nat night when Ring and Whitie guarded his hiding-place. For the rest, he\nhad eyes and ears, and a long rifle and an unerring aim, which he meant\nto use. Strangely his foreshadowing of change did not hold a thought\nof the killing of Tull. It related only to what was to happen to him in\nDeception Pass; and he could no more lift the veil of that mystery than\ntell where the trails led to in that unexplored canyon. Moreover, he did\nnot care. And at length, tired out by stress of thought, he fell asleep.\n\nWhen his eyes unclosed, day had come again, and he saw the rim of the\nopposite wall tipped with the gold of sunrise. A few moments sufficed\nfor the morning's simple camp duties. Near at hand he found Wrangle,\nand to his surprise the horse came to him. Wrangle was one of the horses\nthat left his viciousness in the home corral. What he wanted was to be\nfree of mules and burros and steers, to roll in dust-patches, and then\nto run down the wide, open, windy sage-plains, and at night browse and\nsleep in the cool wet grass of a springhole. Jerd knew the sorrel when\nhe said of him, \"Wait till he smells the sage!\"\n\nVenters saddled and led him out of the oak thicket, and, leaping\nastride, rode up the canyon, with Ring and Whitie trotting behind. An\nold grass-grown trail followed the course of a shallow wash where flowed\na thin stream of water. The canyon was a hundred rods wide, its yellow\nwalls were perpendicular; it had abundant sage and a scant growth of oak\nand pinon. For five miles it held to a comparatively straight bearing,\nand then began a heightening of rugged walls and a deepening of the\nfloor. Beyond this point of sudden change in the character of the\ncanyon Venters had never explored, and here was the real door to the\nintricacies of Deception Pass.\n\nHe reined Wrangle to a walk, halted now and then to listen, and then\nproceeded cautiously with shifting and alert gaze. The canyon assumed\nproportions that dwarfed those of its first ten miles. Venters rode on\nand on, not losing in the interest of his wide surroundings any of his\ncaution or keen search for tracks or sight of living thing. If there\never had been a trail here, he could not find it. He rode through sage\nand clumps of pinon trees and grassy plots where long-petaled purple\nlilies bloomed. He rode through a dark constriction of the pass no wider\nthan the lane in the grove at Cottonwoods. And he came out into a great\namphitheater into which jutted huge towering corners of a confluence of\nintersecting canyons.\n\nVenters sat his horse, and, with a rider's eye, studied this wild\ncross-cut of huge stone gullies. Then he went on, guided by the course\nof running water. If it had not been for the main stream of water\nflowing north he would never have been able to tell which of those many\nopenings was a continuation of the pass. In crossing this amphitheater\nhe went by the mouths of five canyons, fording little streams that\nflowed into the larger one. Gaining the outlet which he took to be the\npass, he rode on again under over hanging walls. One side was dark in\nshade, the other light in sun. This narrow passageway turned and twisted\nand opened into a valley that amazed Venters.\n\nHere again was a sweep of purple sage, richer than upon the higher\nlevels. The valley was miles long, several wide, and inclosed by\nunscalable walls. But it was the background of this valley that so\nforcibly struck him. Across the sage-flat rose a strange up-flinging of\nyellow rocks. He could not tell which were close and which were distant.\nScrawled mounds of stone, like mountain waves, seemed to roll up to\nsteep bare slopes and towers.\n\nIn this plain of sage Venters flushed birds and rabbits, and when he had\nproceeded about a mile he caught sight of the bobbing white tails of\na herd of running antelope. He rode along the edge of the stream which\nwound toward the western end of the slowly looming mounds of stone.\nThe high slope retreated out of sight behind the nearer protection.\nTo Venters the valley appeared to have been filled in by a mountain of\nmelted stone that had hardened in strange shapes of rounded outline.\nHe followed the stream till he lost it in a deep cut. Therefore Venters\nquit the dark slit which baffled further search in that direction, and\nrode out along the curved edge of stone where it met the sage. It was\nnot long before he came to a low place, and here Wrangle readily climbed\nup.\n\nAll about him was ridgy roll of wind-smoothed, rain-washed rock. Not a\ntuft of grass or a bunch of sage colored the dull rust-yellow. He saw\nwhere, to the right, this uneven flow of stone ended in a blunt wall.\nLeftward, from the hollow that lay at his feet, mounted a gradual\nslow-swelling slope to a great height topped by leaning, cracked,\nand ruined crags. Not for some time did he grasp the wonder of that\nacclivity. It was no less than a mountain-side, glistening in the sun\nlike polished granite, with cedar-trees springing as if by magic out of\nthe denuded surface. Winds had swept it clear of weathered shale, and\nrains had washed it free of dust. Far up the curved slope its beautiful\nlines broke to meet the vertical rim-wall, to lose its grace in a\ndifferent order and color of rock, a stained yellow cliff of cracks and\ncaves and seamed crags. And straight before Venters was a scene less\nstriking but more significant to his keen survey. For beyond a mile\nof the bare, hummocky rock began the valley of sage, and the mouths of\ncanyons, one of which surely was another gateway into the pass.\n\n\nHe got off his horse, and, giving the bridle to Ring to hold, he\ncommenced a search for the cleft where the stream ran. He was not\nsuccessful and concluded the water dropped into an underground passage.\nThen he returned to where he had left Wrangle, and led him down off the\nstone to the sage. It was a short ride to the opening canyons. There was\nno reason for a choice of which one to enter. The one he rode into was a\nclear, sharp shaft in yellow stone a thousand feet deep, with wonderful\nwind-worn caves low down and high above buttressed and turreted\nramparts. Farther on Venters came into a region where deep indentations\nmarked the line of canyon walls. These were huge, cove-like blind\npockets extending back to a sharp corner with a dense growth of\nunderbrush and trees.\n\nVenters penetrated into one of these offshoots, and, as he had hoped, he\nfound abundant grass. He had to bend the oak saplings to get his horse\nthrough. Deciding to make this a hiding-place if he could find water, he\nworked back to the limit of the shelving walls. In a little cluster of\nsilver spruces he found a spring. This inclosed nook seemed an ideal\nplace to leave his horse and to camp at night, and from which to make\nstealthy trips on foot. The thick grass hid his trail; the dense growth\nof oaks in the opening would serve as a barrier to keep Wrangle in, if,\nindeed, the luxuriant browse would not suffice for that. So Venters,\nleaving Whitie with the horse, called Ring to his side, and, rifle in\nhand, worked his way out to the open. A careful photographing in mind\nof the formation of the bold outlines of rimrock assured him he would be\nable to return to his retreat even in the dark.\n\nBunches of scattered sage covered the center of the canyon, and among\nthese Venters threaded his way with the step of an Indian. At intervals\nhe put his hand on the dog and stopped to listen. There was a drowsy\nhum of insects, but no other sound disturbed the warm midday stillness.\nVenters saw ahead a turn, more abrupt than any yet. Warily he rounded\nthis corner, once again to halt bewildered.\n\nThe canyon opened fan-shaped into a great oval of green and gray\ngrowths. It was the hub of an oblong wheel, and from it, at regular\ndistances, like spokes, ran the outgoing canyons. Here a dull red color\npredominated over the fading yellow. The corners of wall bluntly rose,\nscarred and scrawled, to taper into towers and serrated peaks and\npinnacled domes.\n\nVenters pushed on more heedfully than ever. Toward the center of this\ncircle the sage-brush grew smaller and farther apart He was about to\nsheer off to the right, where thickets and jumbles of fallen rock would\nafford him cover, when he ran right upon a broad cattle trail. Like a\nroad it was, more than a trail, and the cattle tracks were fresh. What\nsurprised him more, they were wet! He pondered over this feature. It\nhad not rained. The only solution to this puzzle was that the cattle had\nbeen driven through water, and water deep enough to wet their legs.\n\nSuddenly Ring growled low. Venters rose cautiously and looked over the\nsage. A band of straggling horsemen were riding across the oval. He\nsank down, startled and trembling. \"Rustlers!\" he muttered. Hurriedly\nhe glanced about for a place to hide. Near at hand there was\nnothing but sage-brush. He dared not risk crossing the open\npatches to reach the rocks. Again he peeped over the sage. The\nrustlers--four--five--seven--eight in all, were approaching, but not\ndirectly in line with him. That was relief for a cold deadness which\nseemed to be creeping inward along his veins. He crouched down with\nbated breath and held the bristling dog.\n\nHe heard the click of iron-shod hoofs on stone, the coarse laughter of\nmen, and then voices gradually dying away. Long moments passed. Then he\nrose. The rustlers were riding into a canyon. Their horses were tired,\nand they had several pack animals; evidently they had traveled far.\nVenters doubted that they were the rustlers who had driven the red herd.\nOlding's band had split. Venters watched these horsemen disappear under\na bold canyon wall.\n\nThe rustlers had come from the northwest side of the oval. Venters kept\na steady gaze in that direction, hoping, if there were more, to see\nfrom what canyon they rode. A quarter of an hour went by. Reward for his\nvigilance came when he descried three more mounted men, far over to the\nnorth. But out of what canyon they had ridden it was too late to tell.\nHe watched the three ride across the oval and round the jutting red\ncorner where the others had gone.\n\n\"Up that canyon!\" exclaimed Venters. \"Oldring's den! I've found it!\"\n\nA knotty point for Venters was the fact that the cattle tracks all\npointed west. The broad trail came from the direction of the canyon\ninto which the rustlers had ridden, and undoubtedly the cattle had been\ndriven out of it across the oval. There were no tracks pointing the\nother way. It had been in his mind that Oldring had driven the red herd\ntoward the rendezvous, and not from it. Where did that broad trail come\ndown into the pass, and where did it lead? Venters knew he wasted\ntime in pondering the question, but it held a fascination not easily\ndispelled. For many years Oldring's mysterious entrance and exit to\nDeception Pass had been all-absorbing topics to sage-riders.\n\nAll at once the dog put an end to Venters's pondering. Ring sniffed the\nair, turned slowly in his tracks with a whine, and then growled. Venters\nwheeled. Two horsemen were within a hundred yards, coming straight at\nhim. One, lagging behind the other, was Oldring's Masked Rider.\n\nVenters cunningly sank, slowly trying to merge into sage-brush. But,\nguarded as his action was, the first horse detected it. He stopped\nshort, snorted, and shot up his ears. The rustler bent forward, as if\nkeenly peering ahead. Then, with a swift sweep, he jerked a gun from its\nsheath and fired.\n\nThe bullet zipped through the sage-brush. Flying bits of wood struck\nVenters, and the hot, stinging pain seemed to lift him in one leap.\nLike a flash the blue barrel of his rifle gleamed level and he shot\nonce--twice.\n\nThe foremost rustler dropped his weapon and toppled from his saddle, to\nfall with his foot catching in a stirrup. The horse snorted wildly and\nplunged away, dragging the rustler through the sage.\n\nThe Masked Rider huddled over his pommel slowly swaying to one side, and\nthen, with a faint, strange cry, slipped out of the saddle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE MASKED RIDER\n\nVenters looked quickly from the fallen rustlers to the canyon where the\nothers had disappeared. He calculated on the time needed for running\nhorses to return to the open, if their riders heard shots. He waited\nbreathlessly. But the estimated time dragged by and no riders appeared.\nVenters began presently to believe that the rifle reports had not\npenetrated into the recesses of the canyon, and felt safe for the\nimmediate present.\n\nHe hurried to the spot where the first rustler had been dragged by his\nhorse. The man lay in deep grass, dead, jaw fallen, eyes protruding--a\nsight that sickened Venters. The first man at whom he had ever aimed a\nweapon he had shot through the heart. With the clammy sweat oozing\nfrom every pore Venters dragged the rustler in among some boulders and\ncovered him with slabs of rock. Then he smoothed out the crushed trail\nin grass and sage. The rustler's horse had stopped a quarter of a mile\noff and was grazing.\n\nWhen Venters rapidly strode toward the Masked Rider not even the cold\nnausea that gripped him could wholly banish curiosity. For he had shot\nOldring's infamous lieutenant, whose face had never been seen. Venters\nexperienced a grim pride in the feat. What would Tull say to this\nachievement of the outcast who rode too often to Deception Pass?\n\nVenters's curious eagerness and expectation had not prepared him for the\nshock he received when he stood over a slight, dark figure. The rustler\nwore the black mask that had given him his name, but he had no weapons.\nVenters glanced at the drooping horse, there were no gun-sheaths on the\nsaddle.\n\n\"A rustler who didn't pack guns!\" muttered Venters. \"He wears no belt.\nHe couldn't pack guns in that rig.... Strange!\"\n\nA low, gasping intake of breath and a sudden twitching of body told\nVenters the rider still lived.\n\n\"He's alive!... I've got to stand here and watch him die. And I shot an\nunarmed man.\"\n\nShrinkingly Venters removed the rider's wide sombrero and the black\ncloth mask. This action disclosed bright chestnut hair, inclined to\ncurl, and a white, youthful face. Along the lower line of cheek and jaw\nwas a clear demarcation, where the brown of tanned skin met the white\nthat had been hidden from the sun.\n\n\"Oh, he's only a boy!... What! Can he be Oldring's Masked Rider?\"\n\nThe boy showed signs of returning consciousness. He stirred; his lips\nmoved; a small brown hand clenched in his blouse.\n\nVenters knelt with a gathering horror of his deed. His bullet had\nentered the rider's right breast, high up to the shoulder. With hands\nthat shook, Venters untied a black scarf and ripped open the blood-wet\nblouse.\n\nFirst he saw a gaping hole, dark red against a whiteness of skin, from\nwhich welled a slender red stream. Then the graceful, beautiful swell of\na woman's breast!\n\n\"A woman!\" he cried. \"A girl!... I've killed a girl!\"\n\nShe suddenly opened eyes that transfixed Venters. They were fathomless\nblue. Consciousness of death was there, a blended terror and pain, but\nno consciousness of sight. She did not see Venters. She stared into the\nunknown.\n\nThen came a spasm of vitality. She writhed in a torture of reviving\nstrength, and in her convulsions she almost tore from Ventner's grasp.\nSlowly she relaxed and sank partly back. The ungloved hand sought the\nwound, and pressed so hard that her wrist half buried itself in her\nbosom. Blood trickled between her spread fingers. And she looked at\nVenters with eyes that saw him.\n\nHe cursed himself and the unerring aim of which he had been so proud. He\nhad seen that look in the eyes of a crippled antelope which he was\nabout to finish with his knife. But in her it had infinitely more--a\nrevelation of mortal spirit. The instinctive bringing to life was\nthere, and the divining helplessness and the terrible accusation of the\nstricken.\n\n\"Forgive me! I didn't know!\" burst out Venters.\n\n\"You shot me--you've killed me!\" she whispered, in panting gasps. Upon\nher lips appeared a fluttering, bloody froth. By that Venters knew\nthe air in her lungs was mixing with blood. \"Oh, I knew--it\nwould--come--some day!... Oh, the burn!... Hold me--I'm sinking--it's all\ndark.... Ah, God!... Mercy--\"\n\nHer rigidity loosened in one long quiver and she lay back limp, still,\nwhite as snow, with closed eyes.\n\nVenters thought then that she died. But the faint pulsation of her\nbreast assured him that life yet lingered. Death seemed only a matter\nof moments, for the bullet had gone clear through her. Nevertheless, he\ntore sageleaves from a bush, and, pressing them tightly over her wounds,\nhe bound the black scarf round her shoulder, tying it securely under\nher arm. Then he closed the blouse, hiding from his sight that\nblood-stained, accusing breast.\n\n\"What--now?\" he questioned, with flying mind. \"I must get out of here.\nShe's dying--but I can't leave her.\"\n\nHe rapidly surveyed the sage to the north and made out no animate\nobject. Then he picked up the girl's sombrero and the mask. This time\nthe mask gave him as great a shock as when he first removed it from\nher face. For in the woman he had forgotten the rustler, and this black\nstrip of felt-cloth established the identity of Oldring's Masked Rider.\nVenters had solved the mystery. He slipped his rifle under her, and,\nlifting her carefully upon it, he began to retrace his steps. The\ndog trailed in his shadow. And the horse, that had stood drooping by,\nfollowed without a call. Venters chose the deepest tufts of grass and\nclumps of sage on his return. From time to time he glanced over his\nshoulder. He did not rest. His concern was to avoid jarring the girl and\nto hide his trail. Gaining the narrow canyon, he turned and held close\nto the wall till he reached his hiding-place. When he entered the dense\nthicket of oaks he was hard put to it to force a way through. But he\nheld his burden almost upright, and by slipping side wise and bending\nthe saplings he got in. Through sage and grass he hurried to the grove\nof silver spruces.\n\nHe laid the girl down, almost fearing to look at her. Though marble pale\nand cold, she was living. Venters then appreciated the tax that long\ncarry had been to his strength. He sat down to rest. Whitie sniffed at\nthe pale girl and whined and crept to Venters's feet. Ring lapped the\nwater in the runway of the spring.\n\nPresently Venters went out to the opening, caught the horse and, leading\nhim through the thicket, unsaddled him and tied him with a long halter.\nWrangle left his browsing long enough to whinny and toss his head.\nVenters felt that he could not rest easily till he had secured the other\nrustler's horse; so, taking his rifle and calling for Ring, he set out.\nSwiftly yet watchfully he made his way through the canyon to the oval\nand out to the cattle trail. What few tracks might have betrayed him\nhe obliterated, so only an expert tracker could have trailed him. Then,\nwith many a wary backward glance across the sage, he started to round\nup the rustler's horse. This was unexpectedly easy. He led the horse to\nlower ground, out of sight from the opposite side of the oval along the\nshadowy western wall, and so on into his canyon and secluded camp.\n\nThe girl's eyes were open; a feverish spot burned in her cheeks she\nmoaned something unintelligible to Venters, but he took the movement of\nher lips to mean that she wanted water. Lifting her head, he tipped the\ncanteen to her lips. After that she again lapsed into unconsciousness or\na weakness which was its counterpart. Venters noted, however, that the\nburning flush had faded into the former pallor.\n\nThe sun set behind the high canyon rim, and a cool shade darkened the\nwalls. Venters fed the dogs and put a halter on the dead rustlers horse.\nHe allowed Wrangle to browse free. This done, he cut spruce boughs and\nmade a lean-to for the girl. Then, gently lifting her upon a blanket,\nhe folded the sides over her. The other blanket he wrapped about his\nshoulders and found a comfortable seat against a spruce-tree that upheld\nthe little shack. Ring and Whitie lay near at hand, one asleep, the\nother watchful.\n\nVenters dreaded the night's vigil. At night his mind was active, and\nthis time he had to watch and think and feel beside a dying girl whom\nhe had all but murdered. A thousand excuses he invented for himself, yet\nnot one made any difference in his act or his self-reproach.\n\nIt seemed to him that when night fell black he could see her white face\nso much more plainly.\n\n\"She'll go, presently,\" he said, \"and be out of agony--thank God!\"\n\nEvery little while certainty of her death came to him with a shock; and\nthen he would bend over and lay his ear on her breast. Her heart still\nbeat.\n\nThe early night blackness cleared to the cold starlight. The horses were\nnot moving, and no sound disturbed the deathly silence of the canyon.\n\n\"I'll bury her here,\" thought Venters, \"and let her grave be as much a\nmystery as her life was.\"\n\nFor the girl's few words, the look of her eyes, the prayer, had\nstrangely touched Venters.\n\n\"She was only a girl,\" he soliloquized. \"What was she to Oldring?\nRustlers don't have wives nor sisters nor daughters. She was bad--that's\nall. But somehow... well, she may not have willingly become the companion\nof rustlers. That prayer of hers to God for mercy!... Life is strange\nand cruel. I wonder if other members of Oldring's gang are women? Likely\nenough. But what was his game? Oldring's Mask Rider! A name to make\nvillagers hide and lock their doors. A name credited with a dozen\nmurders, a hundred forays, and a thousand stealings of cattle. What\npart did the girl have in this? It may have served Oldring to create\nmystery.\"\n\nHours passed. The white stars moved across the narrow strip of dark-blue\nsky above. The silence awoke to the low hum of insects. Venters watched\nthe immovable white face, and as he watched, hour by hour waiting for\ndeath, the infamy of her passed from his mind. He thought only of the\nsadness, the truth of the moment. Whoever she was--whatever she had\ndone--she was young and she was dying.\n\nThe after-part of the night wore on interminably. The starlight failed\nand the gloom blackened to the darkest hour. \"She'll die at the gray\nof dawn,\" muttered Venters, remembering some old woman's fancy. The\nblackness paled to gray, and the gray lightened and day peeped over\nthe eastern rim. Venters listened at the breast of the girl. She\nstill lived. Did he only imagine that her heart beat stronger, ever so\nslightly, but stronger? He pressed his ear closer to her breast. And he\nrose with his own pulse quickening.\n\n\"If she doesn't die soon--she's got a chance--the barest chance to\nlive,\" he said.\n\nHe wondered if the internal bleeding had ceased. There was no more film\nof blood upon her lips. But no corpse could have been whiter. Opening\nher blouse, he untied the scarf, and carefully picked away the sage\nleaves from the wound in her shoulder. It had closed. Lifting her\nlightly, he ascertained that the same was true of the hole where the\nbullet had come out. He reflected on the fact that clean wounds closed\nquickly in the healing upland air. He recalled instances of riders who\nhad been cut and shot apparently to fatal issues; yet the blood had\nclotted, the wounds closed, and they had recovered. He had no way to\ntell if internal hemorrhage still went on, but he believed that it had\nstopped. Otherwise she would surely not have lived so long. He marked\nthe entrance of the bullet, and concluded that it had just touched the\nupper lobe of her lung. Perhaps the wound in the lung had also closed.\nAs he began to wash the blood stains from her breast and carefully\nrebandage the wound, he was vaguely conscious of a strange, grave\nhappiness in the thought that she might live.\n\nBroad daylight and a hint of sunshine high on the cliff-rim to the west\nbrought him to consideration of what he had better do. And while busy\nwith his few camp tasks he revolved the thing in his mind. It would not\nbe wise for him to remain long in his present hiding-place. And if he\nintended to follow the cattle trail and try to find the rustlers he had\nbetter make a move at once. For he knew that rustlers, being riders,\nwould not make much of a day's or night's absence from camp for one\nor two of their number; but when the missing ones failed to show up in\nreasonable time there would be a search. And Venters was afraid of that.\n\n\"A good tracker could trail me,\" he muttered. \"And I'd be cornered here.\nLet's see. Rustlers are a lazy set when they're not on the ride. I'll\nrisk it. Then I'll change my hiding-place.\"\n\nHe carefully cleaned and reloaded his guns. When he rose to go he bent\na long glance down upon the unconscious girl. Then ordering Whitie and\nRing to keep guard, he left the camp.\n\nThe safest cover lay close under the wall of the canyon, and here\nthrough the dense thickets Venters made his slow, listening advance\ntoward the oval. Upon gaining the wide opening he decided to cross it\nand follow the left wall till he came to the cattle trail. He scanned\nthe oval as keenly as if hunting for antelope. Then, stooping, he stole\nfrom one cover to another, taking advantage of rocks and bunches of\nsage, until he had reached the thickets under the opposite wall. Once\nthere, he exercised extreme caution in his surveys of the ground ahead,\nbut increased his speed when moving. Dodging from bush to bush, he\npassed the mouths of two canyons, and in the entrance of a third canyon\nhe crossed a wash of swift clear water, to come abruptly upon the cattle\ntrail.\n\nIt followed the low bank of the wash, and, keeping it in sight, Venters\nhugged the line of sage and thicket. Like the curves of a serpent the\ncanyon wound for a mile or more and then opened into a valley. Patches\nof red showed clear against the purple of sage, and farther out on the\nlevel dotted strings of red led away to the wall of rock.\n\n\"Ha, the red herd!\" exclaimed Venters.\n\nThen dots of white and black told him there were cattle of other colors\nin this inclosed valley. Oldring, the rustler, was also a rancher.\nVenters's calculating eye took count of stock that outnumbered the red\nherd.\n\n\"What a range!\" went on Venters. \"Water and grass enough for fifty\nthousand head, and no riders needed!\"\n\nAfter his first burst of surprise and rapid calculation Venters lost no\ntime there, but slunk again into the sage on his back trail. With the\ndiscovery of Oldring's hidden cattle-range had come enlightenment\non several problems. Here the rustler kept his stock, here was Jane\nWithersteen's red herd; here were the few cattle that had disappeared\nfrom the Cottonwoods slopes during the last two years. Until Oldring had\ndriven the red herd his thefts of cattle for that time had not been\nmore than enough to supply meat for his men. Of late no drives had been\nreported from Sterling or the villages north. And Venters knew that the\nriders had wondered at Oldring's inactivity in that particular field.\nHe and his band had been active enough in their visits to Glaze and\nCottonwoods; they always had gold; but of late the amount gambled\naway and drunk and thrown away in the villages had given rise to much\nconjecture. Oldring's more frequent visits had resulted in new saloons,\nand where there had formerly been one raid or shooting fray in the\nlittle hamlets there were now many. Perhaps Oldring had another range\nfarther on up the pass, and from there drove the cattle to distant Utah\ntowns where he was little known But Venters came finally to doubt this.\nAnd, from what he had learned in the last few days, a belief began to\nform in Venters's mind that Oldring's intimidations of the villages and\nthe mystery of the Masked Rider, with his alleged evil deeds, and the\nfierce resistance offered any trailing riders, and the rustling of\ncattle--these things were only the craft of the rustler-chief to conceal\nhis real life and purpose and work in Deception Pass.\n\nAnd like a scouting Indian Venters crawled through the sage of the oval\nvalley, crossed trail after trail on the north side, and at last entered\nthe canyon out of which headed the cattle trail, and into which he had\nwatched the rustlers disappear.\n\nIf he had used caution before, now he strained every nerve to force\nhimself to creeping stealth and to sensitiveness of ear. He crawled\nalong so hidden that he could not use his eyes except to aid himself in\nthe toilsome progress through the brakes and ruins of cliff-wall. Yet\nfrom time to time, as he rested, he saw the massive red walls growing\nhigher and wilder, more looming and broken. He made note of the fact\nthat he was turning and climbing. The sage and thickets of oak and\nbrakes of alder gave place to pinyon pine growing out of rocky soil.\nSuddenly a low, dull murmur assailed his ears. At first he thought it\nwas thunder, then the slipping of a weathered slope of rock. But it was\nincessant, and as he progressed it filled out deeper and from a murmur\nchanged into a soft roar.\n\n\"Falling water,\" he said. \"There's volume to that. I wonder if it's the\nstream I lost.\"\n\nThe roar bothered him, for he could hear nothing else. Likewise,\nhowever, no rustlers could hear him. Emboldened by this and sure that\nnothing but a bird could see him, he arose from his hands and knees to\nhurry on. An opening in the pinyons warned him that he was nearing the\nheight of slope.\n\nHe gained it, and dropped low with a burst of astonishment. Before him\nstretched a short canyon with rounded stone floor bare of grass or sage\nor tree, and with curved, shelving walls. A broad rippling stream flowed\ntoward him, and at the back of the canyon waterfall burst from a wide\nrent in the cliff, and, bounding down in two green steps, spread into a\nlong white sheet.\n\nIf Venters had not been indubitably certain that he had entered the\nright canyon his astonishment would not have been so great. There had\nbeen no breaks in the walls, no side canyons entering this one where the\nrustlers' tracks and the cattle trail had guided him, and, therefore, he\ncould not be wrong. But here the canyon ended, and presumably the trails\nalso.\n\n\"That cattle trail headed out of here,\" Venters kept saying to himself.\n\"It headed out. Now what I want to know is how on earth did cattle ever\nget in here?\"\n\nIf he could be sure of anything it was of the careful scrutiny he had\ngiven that cattle track, every hoofmark of which headed straight west.\nHe was now looking east at an immense round boxed corner of canyon down\nwhich tumbled a thin, white veil of water, scarcely twenty yards wide.\nSomehow, somewhere, his calculations had gone wrong. For the first time\nin years he found himself doubting his rider's skill in finding tracks,\nand his memory of what he had actually seen. In his anxiety to keep\nunder cover he must have lost himself in this offshoot of Deception\nPass, and thereby in some unaccountable manner, missed the canyon with\nthe trails. There was nothing else for him to think. Rustlers could not\nfly, nor cattle jump down thousand-foot precipices. He was only proving\nwhat the sage-riders had long said of this labyrinthine system of\ndeceitful canyons and valleys--trails led down into Deception Pass, but\nno rider had ever followed them.\n\nOn a sudden he heard above the soft roar of the waterfall an unusual\nsound that he could not define. He dropped flat behind a stone and\nlistened. From the direction he had come swelled something that\nresembled a strange muffled pounding and splashing and ringing. Despite\nhis nerve the chill sweat began to dampen his forehead. What might not\nbe possible in this stonewalled maze of mystery? The unnatural sound\npassed beyond him as he lay gripping his rifle and fighting for\ncoolness. Then from the open came the sound, now distinct and different.\nVenters recognized a hobble-bell of a horse, and the cracking of iron on\nsubmerged stones, and the hollow splash of hoofs in water.\n\nRelief surged over him. His mind caught again at realities, and\ncuriosity prompted him to peep from behind the rock.\n\nIn the middle of the stream waded a long string of packed burros driven\nby three superbly mounted men. Had Venters met these dark-clothed,\ndark-visaged, heavily armed men anywhere in Utah, let alone in this\nrobbers' retreat, he would have recognized them as rustlers. The\ndiscerning eye of a rider saw the signs of a long, arduous trip. These\nmen were packing in supplies from one of the northern villages. They\nwere tired, and their horses were almost played out, and the burros\nplodded on, after the manner of their kind when exhausted, faithful and\npatient, but as if every weary, splashing, slipping step would be their\nlast.\n\nAll this Venters noted in one glance. After that he watched with a\nthrilling eagerness. Straight at the waterfall the rustlers drove the\nburros, and straight through the middle, where the water spread into a\nfleecy, thin film like dissolving smoke. Following closely, the rustlers\nrode into this white mist, showing in bold black relief for an instant,\nand then they vanished.\n\nVenters drew a full breath that rushed out in brief and sudden\nutterance.\n\n\"Good Heaven! Of all the holes for a rustler!... There's a cavern under\nthat waterfall, and a passageway leading out to a canyon beyond. Oldring\nhides in there. He needs only to guard a trail leading down from\nthe sage-flat above. Little danger of this outlet to the pass being\ndiscovered. I stumbled on it by luck, after I had given up. And now I\nknow the truth of what puzzled me most--why that cattle trail was wet!\"\n\nHe wheeled and ran down the slope, and out to the level of the\nsage-brush. Returning, he had no time to spare, only now and then,\nbetween dashes, a moment when he stopped to cast sharp eyes ahead. The\nabundant grass left no trace of his trail. Short work he made of the\ndistance to the circle of canyons. He doubted that he would ever see it\nagain; he knew he never wanted to; yet he looked at the red corners\nand towers with the eyes of a rider picturing landmarks never to be\nforgotten.\n\nHere he spent a panting moment in a slow-circling gaze of the sage-oval\nand the gaps between the bluffs. Nothing stirred except the gentle wave\nof the tips of the brush. Then he pressed on past the mouths of several\ncanyons and over ground new to him, now close under the eastern wall.\nThis latter part proved to be easy traveling, well screened from\npossible observation from the north and west, and he soon covered it\nand felt safer in the deepening shade of his own canyon. Then the huge,\nnotched bulge of red rim loomed over him, a mark by which he knew again\nthe deep cove where his camp lay hidden. As he penetrated the thicket,\nsafe again for the present, his thoughts reverted to the girl he had\nleft there. The afternoon had far advanced. How would he find her? He\nran into camp, frightening the dogs.\n\nThe girl lay with wide-open, dark eyes, and they dilated when he knelt\nbeside her. The flush of fever shone in her cheeks. He lifted her and\nheld water to her dry lips, and felt an inexplicable sense of lightness\nas he saw her swallow in a slow, choking gulp. Gently he laid her back.\n\n\"Who--are--you?\" she whispered, haltingly.\n\n\"I'm the man who shot you,\" he replied.\n\n\"You'll--not--kill me--now?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"What--will--you--do--with me?\"\n\n\"When you get better--strong enough--I'll take you back to the canyon\nwhere the rustlers ride through the waterfall.\"\n\nAs with a faint shadow from a flitting wing overhead, the marble\nwhiteness of her face seemed to change.\n\n\"Don't--take--me--back--there!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE MILL-WHEEL OF STEERS\n\nMeantime, at the ranch, when Judkins's news had sent Venters on the\ntrail of the rustlers, Jane Withersteen led the injured man to her house\nand with skilled fingers dressed the gunshot wound in his arm.\n\n\"Judkins, what do you think happened to my riders?\"\n\n\"I--I d rather not say,\" he replied.\n\n\"Tell me. Whatever you'll tell me I'll keep to myself. I'm beginning\nto worry about more than the loss of a herd of cattle. Venters hinted\nof--but tell me, Judkins.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Withersteen, I think as Venters thinks--your riders have\nbeen called in.\"\n\n\"Judkins!... By whom?\"\n\n\"You know who handles the reins of your Mormon riders.\"\n\n\"Do you dare insinuate that my churchmen have ordered in my riders?\"\n\n\"I ain't insinuatin' nothin', Miss Withersteen,\" answered Judkins, with\nspirit. \"I know what I'm talking about. I didn't want to tell you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't believe that! I'll not believe it! Would Tull leave my\nherds at the mercy of rustlers and wolves just because--because--? No,\nno! It's unbelievable.\"\n\n\"Yes, thet particular thing's onheard of around Cottonwoods But, beggin'\npardon, Miss Withersteen, there never was any other rich Mormon woman\nhere on the border, let alone one thet's taken the bit between her\nteeth.\"\n\nThat was a bold thing for the reserved Judkins to say, but it did not\nanger her. This rider's crude hint of her spirit gave her a glimpse of\nwhat others might think. Humility and obedience had been hers always.\nBut had she taken the bit between her teeth? Still she wavered. And\nthen, with quick spurt of warm blood along her veins, she thought of\nBlack Star when he got the bit fast between his iron jaws and ran wild\nin the sage. If she ever started to run! Jane smothered the glow and\nburn within her, ashamed of a passion for freedom that opposed her duty.\n\n\"Judkins, go to the village,\" she said, \"and when you have learned\nanything definite about my riders please come to me at once.\"\n\nWhen he had gone Jane resolutely applied her mind to a number of tasks\nthat of late had been neglected. Her father had trained her in the\nmanagement of a hundred employees and the working of gardens and fields;\nand to keep record of the movements of cattle and riders. And beside the\nmany duties she had added to this work was one of extreme delicacy, such\nas required all her tact and ingenuity. It was an unobtrusive, almost\nsecret aid which she rendered to the Gentile families of the village.\nThough Jane Withersteen never admitted so to herself, it amounted to no\nless than a system of charity. But for her invention of numberless kinds\nof employment, for which there was no actual need, these families of\nGentiles, who had failed in a Mormon community, would have starved.\n\nIn aiding these poor people Jane thought she deceived her keen\nchurchmen, but it was a kind of deceit for which she did not pray to be\nforgiven. Equally as difficult was the task of deceiving the Gentiles,\nfor they were as proud as they were poor. It had been a great grief to\nher to discover how these people hated her people; and it had been a\nsource of great joy that through her they had come to soften in hatred.\nAt any time this work called for a clearness of mind that precluded\nanxiety and worry; but under the present circumstances it required all\nher vigor and obstinate tenacity to pin her attention upon her task.\n\nSunset came, bringing with the end of her labor a patient calmness and\npower to wait that had not been hers earlier in the day. She expected\nJudkins, but he did not appear. Her house was always quiet; to-night,\nhowever, it seemed unusually so. At supper her women served her with a\nsilent assiduity; it spoke what their sealed lips could not utter--the\nsympathy of Mormon women. Jerd came to her with the key of the great\ndoor of the stone stable, and to make his daily report about the horses.\nOne of his daily duties was to give Black Star and Night and the other\nracers a ten-mile run. This day it had been omitted, and the boy grew\nconfused in explanations that she had not asked for. She did inquire if\nhe would return on the morrow, and Jerd, in mingled surprise and relief,\nassured her he would always work for her. Jane missed the rattle and\ntrot, canter and gallop of the incoming riders on the hard trails. Dusk\nshaded the grove where she walked; the birds ceased singing; the wind\nsighed through the leaves of the cottonwoods, and the running water\nmurmured down its stone-bedded channel. The glimmering of the first star\nwas like the peace and beauty of the night. Her faith welled up in her\nheart and said that all would soon be right in her little world. She\npictured Venters about his lonely camp-fire sitting between his faithful\ndogs. She prayed for his safety, for the success of his undertaking.\n\nEarly the next morning one of Jane's women brought in word that Judkins\nwished to speak to her. She hurried out, and in her surprise to see him\narmed with rifle and revolver, she forgot her intention to inquire about\nhis wound.\n\n\"Judkins! Those guns? You never carried guns.\"\n\n\"It's high time, Miss Withersteen,\" he replied. \"Will you come into the\ngrove? It ain't jest exactly safe for me to be seen here.\"\n\nShe walked with him into the shade of the cottonwoods.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, I went to my mother's house last night. While there,\nsome one knocked, an' a man asked for me. I went to the door. He wore\na mask. He said I'd better not ride any more for Jane Withersteen. His\nvoice was hoarse an' strange, disguised I reckon, like his face. He said\nno more, an' ran off in the dark.\"\n\n\"Did you know who he was?\" asked Jane, in a low voice.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nJane did not ask to know; she did not want to know; she feared to know.\nAll her calmness fled at a single thought.\n\n\"Thet's why I'm packin' guns,\" went on Judkins. \"For I'll never quit\nridin' for you, Miss Withersteen, till you let me go.\"\n\n\"Judkins, do you want to leave me?\"\n\n\"Do I look thet way? Give me a hoss--a fast hoss, an' send me out on the\nsage.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Judkins! You're more faithful than my own people. I\nought not accept your loyalty--you might suffer more through it. But\nwhat in the world can I do? My head whirls. The wrong to Venters--the\nstolen herd--these masks, threats, this coil in the dark! I can't\nunderstand! But I feel something dark and terrible closing in around\nme.\"\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, it's all simple enough,\" said Judkins, earnestly.\n\"Now please listen--an' beggin' your pardon--jest turn thet deaf Mormon\near aside, an' let me talk clear an' plain in the other. I went around\nto the saloons an' the stores an' the loafin' places yesterday. All your\nriders are in. There's talk of a vigilance band organized to hunt down\nrustlers. They call themselves 'The Riders.' Thet's the report--thet's\nthe reason given for your riders leavin' you. Strange thet only a\nfew riders of other ranchers joined the band! An' Tull's man, Jerry\nCard--he's the leader. I seen him en' his hoss. He 'ain't been to Glaze.\nI'm not easy to fool on the looks of a hoss thet's traveled the sage.\nTull an' Jerry didn't ride to Glaze!... Well, I met Blake en' Dorn, both\ngood friends of mine, usually, as far as their Mormon lights will let\n'em go. But these fellers couldn't fool me, an' they didn't try very\nhard. I asked them, straight out like a man, why they left you like\nthet. I didn't forget to mention how you nursed Blake's poor old mother\nwhen she was sick, an' how good you was to Dorn's kids. They looked\nashamed, Miss Withersteen. An' they jest froze up--thet dark set look\nthet makes them strange an' different to me. But I could tell the\ndifference between thet first natural twinge of conscience an' the later\nlook of some secret thing. An' the difference I caught was thet they\ncouldn't help themselves. They hadn't no say in the matter. They looked\nas if their bein' unfaithful to you was bein' faithful to a higher duty.\nAn' there's the secret. Why it's as plain as--as sight of my gun here.\"\n\n\"Plain!... My herds to wander in the sage--to be stolen! Jane Withersteen\na poor woman! Her head to be brought low and her spirit broken!... Why,\nJudkins, it's plain enough.\"\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, let me get what boys I can gather, an' hold the white\nherd. It's on the slope now, not ten miles out--three thousand head,\nan' all steers. They're wild, an' likely to stampede at the pop of a\njack-rabbit's ears. We'll camp right with them, en' try to hold them.\"\n\n\"Judkins, I'll reward you some day for your service, unless all is\ntaken from me. Get the boys and tell Jerd to give you pick of my horses,\nexcept Black Star and Night. But--do not shed blood for my cattle nor\nheedlessly risk your lives.\"\n\nJane Withersteen rushed to the silence and seclusion of her room, and\nthere could not longer hold back the bursting of her wrath. She went\nstone-blind in the fury of a passion that had never before showed its\npower. Lying upon her bed, sightless, voiceless, she was a writhing,\nliving flame. And she tossed there while her fury burned and burned, and\nfinally burned itself out.\n\nThen, weak and spent, she lay thinking, not of the oppression that would\nbreak her, but of this new revelation of self. Until the last few days\nthere had been little in her life to rouse passions. Her forefathers\nhad been Vikings, savage chieftains who bore no cross and brooked no\nhindrance to their will. Her father had inherited that temper; and at\ntimes, like antelope fleeing before fire on the slope, his people fled\nfrom his red rages. Jane Withersteen realized that the spirit of wrath\nand war had lain dormant in her. She shrank from black depths hitherto\nunsuspected. The one thing in man or woman that she scorned above all\nscorn, and which she could not forgive, was hate. Hate headed a flaming\npathway straight to hell. All in a flash, beyond her control there\nhad been in her a birth of fiery hate. And the man who had dragged her\npeaceful and loving spirit to this degradation was a minister of God's\nword, an Elder of her church, the counselor of her beloved Bishop.\n\nThe loss of herds and ranges, even of Amber Spring and the Old Stone\nHouse, no longer concerned Jane Withersteen, she faced the foremost\nthought of her life, what she now considered the mightiest problem--the\nsalvation of her soul.\n\nShe knelt by her bedside and prayed; she prayed as she had never prayed\nin all her life--prayed to be forgiven for her sin to be immune from\nthat dark, hot hate; to love Tull as her minister, though she could not\nlove him as a man; to do her duty by her church and people and those\ndependent upon her bounty; to hold reverence of God and womanhood\ninviolate.\n\nWhen Jane Withersteen rose from that storm of wrath and prayer for help\nshe was serene, calm, sure--a changed woman. She would do her duty as\nshe saw it, live her life as her own truth guided her. She might never\nbe able to marry a man of her choice, but she certainly never would\nbecome the wife of Tull. Her churchmen might take her cattle and horses,\nranges and fields, her corrals and stables, the house of Withersteen and\nthe water that nourished the village of Cottonwoods; but they could not\nforce her to marry Tull, they could not change her decision or break\nher spirit. Once resigned to further loss, and sure of herself, Jane\nWithersteen attained a peace of mind that had not been hers for a year.\nShe forgave Tull, and felt a melancholy regret over what she knew he\nconsidered duty, irrespective of his personal feeling for her. First\nof all, Tull, as he was a man, wanted her for himself; and secondly,\nhe hoped to save her and her riches for his church. She did not believe\nthat Tull had been actuated solely by his minister's zeal to save her\nsoul. She doubted her interpretation of one of his dark sayings--that\nif she were lost to him she might as well be lost to heaven. Jane\nWithersteen's common sense took arms against the binding limits of her\nreligion; and she doubted that her Bishop, whom she had been taught had\ndirect communication with God--would damn her soul for refusing to marry\na Mormon. As for Tull and his churchmen, when they had harassed her,\nperhaps made her poor, they would find her unchangeable, and then she\nwould get back most of what she had lost. So she reasoned, true at last\nto her faith in all men, and in their ultimate goodness.\n\nThe clank of iron hoofs upon the stone courtyard drew her hurriedly\nfrom her retirement. There, beside his horse, stood Lassiter, his dark\napparel and the great black gun-sheaths contrasting singularly with his\ngentle smile. Jane's active mind took up her interest in him and her\nhalf-determined desire to use what charm she had to foil his evident\ndesign in visiting Cottonwoods. If she could mitigate his hatred of\nMormons, or at least keep him from killing more of them, not only would\nshe be saving her people, but also be leading back this bloodspiller to\nsome semblance of the human.\n\n\"Mornin', ma'am,\" he said, black sombrero in hand.\n\n\"Lassiter I'm not an old woman, or even a madam,\" she replied, with her\nbright smile. \"If you can't say Miss Withersteen--call me Jane.\"\n\n\"I reckon Jane would be easier. First names are always handy for me.\"\n\n\"Well, use mine, then. Lassiter, I'm glad to see you. I'm in trouble.\"\n\nThen she told him of Judkins's return, of the driving of the red herd,\nof Venters's departure on Wrangle, and the calling-in of her riders.\n\n\"'Pears to me you're some smilin' an' pretty for a woman with so much\ntrouble,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Lassiter! Are you paying me compliments? But, seriously I've made up\nmy mind not to be miserable. I've lost much, and I'll lose more.\nNevertheless, I won't be sour, and I hope I'll never be unhappy--again.\"\n\nLassiter twisted his hat round and round, as was his way, and took his\ntime in replying.\n\n\"Women are strange to me. I got to back-trailin' myself from them long\nago. But I'd like a game woman. Might I ask, seein' as how you take this\ntrouble, if you're goin' to fight?\"\n\n\"Fight! How? Even if I would, I haven't a friend except that boy who\ndoesn't dare stay in the village.\"\n\n\"I make bold to say, ma'am--Jane--that there's another, if you want\nhim.\"\n\n\"Lassiter!... Thank you. But how can I accept you as a friend? Think!\nWhy, you'd ride down into the village with those terrible guns and kill\nmy enemies--who are also my churchmen.\"\n\n\"I reckon I might be riled up to jest about that,\" he replied, dryly.\n\nShe held out both hands to him.\n\n\"Lassiter! I'll accept your friendship--be proud of it--return it--if I\nmay keep you from killing another Mormon.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you one thing,\" he said, bluntly, as the gray lightning\nformed in his eyes. \"You're too good a woman to be sacrificed as you're\ngoin' to be.... No, I reckon you an' me can't be friends on such terms.\"\n\nIn her earnestness she stepped closer to him, repelled yet fascinated by\nthe sudden transition of his moods. That he would fight for her was at\nonce horrible and wonderful.\n\n\"You came here to kill a man--the man whom Milly Erne--\"\n\n\"The man who dragged Milly Erne to hell--put it that way!... Jane\nWithersteen, yes, that's why I came here. I'd tell so much to no other\nlivin' soul.... There're things such a woman as you'd never dream of--so\ndon't mention her again. Not till you tell me the name of the man!\"\n\n\"Tell you! I? Never!\"\n\n\"I reckon you will. An' I'll never ask you. I'm a man of strange beliefs\nan' ways of thinkin', an' I seem to see into the future an' feel things\nhard to explain. The trail I've been followin' for so many years\nwas twisted en' tangled, but it's straightenin' out now. An', Jane\nWithersteen, you crossed it long ago to ease poor Milly's agony. That,\nwhether you want or not, makes Lassiter your friend. But you cross it\nnow strangely to mean somethin to me--God knows what!--unless by your\nnoble blindness to incite me to greater hatred of Mormon men.\"\n\nJane felt swayed by a strength that far exceeded her own. In a clash of\nwills with this man she would go to the wall. If she were to influence\nhim it must be wholly through womanly allurement. There was that about\nLassiter which commanded her respect. She had abhorred his name; face\nto face with him, she found she feared only his deeds. His mystic\nsuggestion, his foreshadowing of something that she was to mean to him,\npierced deep into her mind. She believed fate had thrown in her way the\nlover or husband of Milly Erne. She believed that through her an evil\nman might be reclaimed. His allusion to what he called her blindness\nterrified her. Such a mistaken idea of his might unleash the bitter,\nfatal mood she sensed in him. At any cost she must placate this man; she\nknew the die was cast, and that if Lassiter did not soften to a woman's\ngrace and beauty and wiles, then it would be because she could not make\nhim.\n\n\"I reckon you'll hear no more such talk from me,\" Lassiter went on,\npresently. \"Now, Miss Jane, I rode in to tell you that your herd of\nwhite steers is down on the slope behind them big ridges. An' I seen\nsomethin' goin' on that'd be mighty interestin' to you, if you could see\nit. Have you a field-glass?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have two glasses. I'll get them and ride out with you. Wait,\nLassiter, please,\" she said, and hurried within. Sending word to Jerd to\nsaddle Black Star and fetch him to the court, she then went to her room\nand changed to the riding-clothes she always donned when going into\nthe sage. In this male attire her mirror showed her a jaunty, handsome\nrider. If she expected some little need of admiration from Lassiter, she\nhad no cause for disappointment. The gentle smile that she liked, which\nmade of him another person, slowly overspread his face.\n\n\"If I didn't take you for a boy!\" he exclaimed. \"It's powerful queer\nwhat difference clothes make. Now I've been some scared of your dignity,\nlike when the other night you was all in white but in this rig--\"\n\nBlack Star came pounding into the court, dragging Jerd half off his\nfeet, and he whistled at Lassiter's black. But at sight of Jane all his\ndefiant lines seemed to soften, and with tosses of his beautiful head he\nwhipped his bridle.\n\n\"Down, Black Star, down,\" said Jane.\n\nHe dropped his head, and, slowly lengthening, he bent one foreleg, then\nthe other, and sank to his knees. Jane slipped her left foot in the\nstirrup, swung lightly into the saddle, and Black Star rose with a\nringing stamp. It was not easy for Jane to hold him to a canter through\nthe grove, and like the wind he broke when he saw the sage. Jane let him\nhave a couple of miles of free running on the open trail, and then she\ncoaxed him in and waited for her companion. Lassiter was not long in\ncatching up, and presently they were riding side by side. It reminded\nher how she used to ride with Venters. Where was he now? She gazed\nfar down the slope to the curved purple lines of Deception Pass and\ninvoluntarily shut her eyes with a trembling stir of nameless fear.\n\n\"We'll turn off here,\" Lassiter said, \"en' take to the sage a mile or\nso. The white herd is behind them big ridges.\"\n\n\"What are you going to show me?\" asked Jane. \"I'm prepared--don't be\nafraid.\"\n\nHe smiled as if he meant that bad news came swiftly enough without being\npresaged by speech.\n\nWhen they reached the lee of a rolling ridge Lassiter dismounted,\nmotioning to her to do likewise. They left the horses standing, bridles\ndown. Then Lassiter, carrying the field-glasses began to lead the way\nup the slow rise of ground. Upon nearing the summit he halted her with a\ngesture.\n\n\"I reckon we'd see more if we didn't show ourselves against the sky,\"\nhe said. \"I was here less than an hour ago. Then the herd was seven or\neight miles south, an' if they ain't bolted yet--\"\n\n\"Lassiter!... Bolted?\"\n\n\"That's what I said. Now let's see.\"\n\nJane climbed a few more paces behind him and then peeped over the ridge.\nJust beyond began a shallow swale that deepened and widened into a\nvalley and then swung to the left. Following the undulating sweep of\nsage, Jane saw the straggling lines and then the great body of the white\nherd. She knew enough about steers, even at a distance of four or\nfive miles, to realize that something was in the wind. Bringing her\nfield-glass into use, she moved it slowly from left to right, which\naction swept the whole herd into range. The stragglers were restless;\nthe more compactly massed steers were browsing. Jane brought the glass\nback to the big sentinels of the herd, and she saw them trot with quick\nsteps, stop short and toss wide horns, look everywhere, and then trot in\nanother direction.\n\n\"Judkins hasn't been able to get his boys together yet,\" said Jane. \"But\nhe'll be there soon. I hope not too late. Lassiter, what's frightening\nthose big leaders?\"\n\n\"Nothin' jest on the minute,\" replied Lassiter. \"Them steers are\nquietin' down. They've been scared, but not bad yet. I reckon the whole\nherd has moved a few miles this way since I was here.\"\n\n\"They didn't browse that distance--not in less than an hour. Cattle\naren't sheep.\"\n\n\"No, they jest run it, en' that looks bad.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, what frightened them?\" repeated Jane, impatiently.\n\n\"Put down your glass. You'll see at first better with a naked eye. Now\nlook along them ridges on the other side of the herd, the ridges where\nthe sun shines bright on the sage.... That's right. Now look en' look\nhard en' wait.\"\n\nLong-drawn moments of straining sight rewarded Jane with nothing save\nthe low, purple rim of ridge and the shimmering sage.\n\n\"It's begun again!\" whispered Lassiter, and he gripped her arm.\n\"Watch.... There, did you see that?\"\n\n\"No, no. Tell me what to look for?\"\n\n\"A white flash--a kind of pin-point of quick light--a gleam as from sun\nshinin' on somethin' white.\"\n\nSuddenly Jane's concentrated gaze caught a fleeting glint. Quickly she\nbrought her glass to bear on the spot. Again the purple sage, magnified\nin color and size and wave, for long moments irritated her with its\nmonotony. Then from out of the sage on the ridge flew up a broad, white\nobject, flashed in the sunlight and vanished. Like magic it was, and\nbewildered Jane.\n\n\"What on earth is that?\"\n\n\"I reckon there's some one behind that ridge throwin' up a sheet or a\nwhite blanket to reflect the sunshine.\"\n\n\"Why?\" queried Jane, more bewildered than ever.\n\n\"To stampede the herd,\" replied Lassiter, and his teeth clicked.\n\n\"Ah!\" She made a fierce, passionate movement, clutched the glass\ntightly, shook as with the passing of a spasm, and then dropped her\nhead. Presently she raised it to greet Lassiter with something like a\nsmile. \"My righteous brethren are at work again,\" she said, in scorn.\nShe had stifled the leap of her wrath, but for perhaps the first time\nin her life a bitter derision curled her lips. Lassiter's cool gray eyes\nseemed to pierce her. \"I said I was prepared for anything; but that was\nhardly true. But why would they--anybody stampede my cattle?\"\n\n\"That's a Mormon's godly way of bringin' a woman to her knees.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, I'll die before I ever bend my knees. I might be led I won't\nbe driven. Do you expect the herd to bolt?\"\n\n\"I don't like the looks of them big steers. But you can never tell.\nCattle sometimes stampede as easily as buffalo. Any little flash or move\nwill start them. A rider gettin' down an' walkin' toward them sometimes\nwill make them jump an' fly. Then again nothin' seems to scare them.\nBut I reckon that white flare will do the biz. It's a new one on me,\nan' I've seen some ridin' an' rustlin'. It jest takes one of them\nGod-fearin' Mormons to think of devilish tricks.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, might not this trick be done by Oldring's men?\" asked Jane,\never grasping at straws.\n\n\"It might be, but it ain't,\" replied Lassiter. \"Oldring's an honest\nthief. He don't skulk behind ridges to scatter your cattle to the four\nwinds. He rides down on you, an' if you don't like it you can throw a\ngun.\"\n\nJane bit her tongue to refrain from championing men who at the very\nmoment were proving to her that they were little and mean compared even\nwith rustlers.\n\n\"Look!... Jane, them leadin' steers have bolted. They're drawin' the\nstragglers, an' that'll pull the whole herd.\"\n\nJane was not quick enough to catch the details called out by Lassiter,\nbut she saw the line of cattle lengthening. Then, like a stream of white\nbees pouring from a huge swarm, the steers stretched out from the main\nbody. In a few moments, with astonishing rapidity, the whole herd got\ninto motion. A faint roar of trampling hoofs came to Jane's ears, and\ngradually swelled; low, rolling clouds of dust began to rise above the\nsage.\n\n\"It's a stampede, an' a hummer,\" said Lassiter.\n\n\"Oh, Lassiter! The herd's running with the valley! It leads into the\ncanyon! There's a straight jump-off!\"\n\n\"I reckon they'll run into it, too. But that's a good many miles yet.\nAn', Jane, this valley swings round almost north before it goes east.\nThat stampede will pass within a mile of us.\"\n\nThe long, white, bobbing line of steers streaked swiftly through the\nsage, and a funnel-shaped dust-cloud arose at a low angle. A dull\nrumbling filled Jane's ears.\n\n\"I'm thinkin' of millin' that herd,\" said Lassiter. His gray glance\nswept up the slope to the west. \"There's some specks an' dust way off\ntoward the village. Mebbe that's Judkins an' his boys. It ain't likely\nhe'll get here in time to help. You'd better hold Black Star here on\nthis high ridge.\"\n\nHe ran to his horse and, throwing off saddle-bags and tightening the\ncinches, he leaped astride and galloped straight down across the valley.\n\nJane went for Black Star and, leading him to the summit of the ridge,\nshe mounted and faced the valley with excitement and expectancy. She had\nheard of milling stampeded cattle, and knew it was a feat accomplished\nby only the most daring riders.\n\nThe white herd was now strung out in a line two miles long. The dull\nrumble of thousands of hoofs deepened into continuous low thunder, and\nas the steers swept swiftly closer the thunder became a heavy roll.\nLassiter crossed in a few moments the level of the valley to the eastern\nrise of ground and there waited the coming of the herd. Presently, as\nthe head of the white line reached a point opposite to where Jane stood,\nLassiter spurred his black into a run.\n\nJane saw him take a position on the off side of the leaders of the\nstampede, and there he rode. It was like a race. They swept on down the\nvalley, and when the end of the white line neared Lassiter's first\nstand the head had begun to swing round to the west. It swung slowly and\nstubbornly, yet surely, and gradually assumed a long, beautiful curve of\nmoving white. To Jane's amaze she saw the leaders swinging, turning till\nthey headed back toward her and up the valley. Out to the right of\nthese wild plunging steers ran Lassiter's black, and Jane's keen eye\nappreciated the fleet stride and sure-footedness of the blind horse.\nThen it seemed that the herd moved in a great curve, a huge half-moon\nwith the points of head and tail almost opposite, and a mile apart But\nLassiter relentlessly crowded the leaders, sheering them to the left,\nturning them little by little. And the dust-blinded wild followers\nplunged on madly in the tracks of their leaders. This ever-moving,\never-changing curve of steers rolled toward Jane and when below her,\nscarce half a mile, it began to narrow and close into a circle. Lassiter\nhad ridden parallel with her position, turned toward her, then aside,\nand now he was riding directly away from her, all the time pushing the\nhead of that bobbing line inward.\n\nIt was then that Jane, suddenly understanding Lassiter's feat stared\nand gasped at the riding of this intrepid man. His horse was fleet and\ntireless, but blind. He had pushed the leaders around and around till\nthey were about to turn in on the inner side of the end of that line\nof steers. The leaders were already running in a circle; the end of the\nherd was still running almost straight. But soon they would be wheeling.\nThen, when Lassiter had the circle formed, how would he escape? With\nJane Withersteen prayer was as ready as praise; and she prayed for this\nman's safety. A circle of dust began to collect. Dimly, as through a\nyellow veil, Jane saw Lassiter press the leaders inward to close the gap\nin the sage. She lost sight of him in the dust, again she thought she\nsaw the black, riderless now, rear and drag himself and fall. Lassiter\nhad been thrown--lost! Then he reappeared running out of the dust into\nthe sage. He had escaped, and she breathed again.\n\nSpellbound, Jane Withersteen watched this stupendous millwheel of\nsteers. Here was the milling of the herd. The white running circle\nclosed in upon the open space of sage. And the dust circles closed above\ninto a pall. The ground quaked and the incessant thunder of pounding\nhoofs rolled on. Jane felt deafened, yet she thrilled to a new sound. As\nthe circle of sage lessened the steers began to bawl, and when it closed\nentirely there came a great upheaval in the center, and a terrible\nthumping of heads and clicking of horns. Bawling, climbing, goring, the\ngreat mass of steers on the inside wrestled in a crashing din, heaved\nand groaned under the pressure. Then came a deadlock. The inner strife\nceased, and the hideous roar and crash. Movement went on in the outer\ncircle, and that, too, gradually stilled. The white herd had come to a\nstop, and the pall of yellow dust began to drift away on the wind.\n\nJane Withersteen waited on the ridge with full and grateful heart.\nLassiter appeared, making his weary way toward her through the sage. And\nup on the slope Judkins rode into sight with his troop of boys. For the\npresent, at least, the white herd would be looked after.\n\nWhen Lassiter reached her and laid his hand on Black Star's mane, Jane\ncould not find speech.\n\n\"Killed--my--hoss,\" he panted.\n\n\"Oh! I'm sorry,\" cried Jane. \"Lassiter! I know you can't replace him,\nbut I'll give you any one of my racers--Bells, or Night, even Black\nStar.\"\n\n\"I'll take a fast hoss, Jane, but not one of your favorites,\" he\nreplied. \"Only--will you let me have Black Star now an' ride him over\nthere an' head off them fellers who stampeded the herd?\"\n\nHe pointed to several moving specks of black and puffs of dust in the\npurple sage.\n\n\"I can head them off with this hoss, an' then--\"\n\n\"Then, Lassiter?\"\n\n\"They'll never stampede no more cattle.\"\n\n\"Oh! No! No!... Lassiter, I won't let you go!\"\n\nBut a flush of fire flamed in her cheeks, and her trembling hands shook\nBlack Star's bridle, and her eyes fell before Lassiter's.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE DAUGHTER OF WITHERSTEEN\n\n\"Lassiter, will you be my rider?\" Jane had asked him.\n\n\"I reckon so,\" he had replied.\n\nFew as the words were, Jane knew how infinitely much they implied. She\nwanted him to take charge of her cattle and horse and ranges, and save\nthem if that were possible. Yet, though she could not have spoken aloud\nall she meant, she was perfectly honest with herself. Whatever the price\nto be paid, she must keep Lassiter close to her; she must shield from\nhim the man who had led Milly Erne to Cottonwoods. In her fear she so\ncontrolled her mind that she did not whisper this Mormon's name to her\nown soul, she did not even think it. Besides, beyond this thing she\nregarded as a sacred obligation thrust upon her, was the need of a\nhelper, of a friend, of a champion in this critical time. If she could\nrule this gun-man, as Venters had called him, if she could even keep him\nfrom shedding blood, what strategy to play his flame and his presence\nagainst the game of oppression her churchmen were waging against her?\nNever would she forget the effect on Tull and his men when Venters\nshouted Lassiter's name. If she could not wholly control Lassiter, then\nwhat she could do might put off the fatal day.\n\nOne of her safe racers was a dark bay, and she called him Bells because\nof the way he struck his iron shoes on the stones. When Jerd led out\nthis slender, beautifully built horse Lassiter suddenly became all eyes.\nA rider's love of a thoroughbred shone in them. Round and round Bells he\nwalked, plainly weakening all the time in his determination not to take\none of Jane's favorite racers.\n\n\"Lassiter, you're half horse, and Bells sees it already,\" said Jane,\nlaughing. \"Look at his eyes. He likes you. He'll love you, too. How\ncan you resist him? Oh, Lassiter, but Bells can run! It's nip and tuck\nbetween him and Wrangle, and only Black Star can beat him. He's too\nspirited a horse for a woman. Take him. He's yours.\"\n\n\"I jest am weak where a hoss's concerned,\" said Lassiter. \"I'll take\nhim, an' I'll take your orders, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad, but never mind the ma'am. Let it still be Jane.\"\n\nFrom that hour, it seemed, Lassiter was always in the saddle, riding\nearly and late, and coincident with his part in Jane's affairs the days\nassumed their old tranquillity. Her intelligence told her this was only\nthe lull before the storm, but her faith would not have it so.\n\nShe resumed her visits to the village, and upon one of these she\nencountered Tull. He greeted her as he had before any trouble came\nbetween them, and she, responsive to peace if not quick to forget, met\nhim halfway with manner almost cheerful. He regretted the loss of her\ncattle; he assured her that the vigilantes which had been organized\nwould soon rout the rustlers; when that had been accomplished her riders\nwould likely return to her.\n\n\"You've done a headstrong thing to hire this man Lassiter,\" Tull went\non, severely. \"He came to Cottonwoods with evil intent.\"\n\n\"I had to have somebody. And perhaps making him my rider may turn out\nbest in the end for the Mormons of Cottonwoods.\"\n\n\"You mean to stay his hand?\"\n\n\"I do--if I can.\"\n\n\"A woman like you can do anything with a man. That would be well, and\nwould atone in some measure for the errors you have made.\"\n\nHe bowed and passed on. Jane resumed her walk with conflicting thoughts.\nShe resented Elder Tull's cold, impassive manner that looked down upon\nher as one who had incurred his just displeasure. Otherwise he would\nhave been the same calm, dark-browed, impenetrable man she had known\nfor ten years. In fact, except when he had revealed his passion in the\nmatter of the seizing of Venters, she had never dreamed he could be\nother than the grave, reproving preacher. He stood out now a strange,\nsecretive man. She would have thought better of him if he had picked\nup the threads of their quarrel where they had parted. Was Tull what\nhe appeared to be? The question flung itself in-voluntarily over Jane\nWithersteen's inhibitive habit of faith without question. And she\nrefused to answer it. Tull could not fight in the open. Venters had said,\nLassiter had said, that her Elder shirked fight and worked in the dark.\nJust now in this meeting Tull had ignored the fact that he had sued,\nexhorted, demanded that she marry him. He made no mention of Venters.\nHis manner was that of the minister who had been outraged, but\nwho overlooked the frailties of a woman. Beyond question he seemed\nunutterably aloof from all knowledge of pressure being brought to bear\nupon her, absolutely guiltless of any connection with secret power over\nriders, with night journeys, with rustlers and stampedes of cattle. And\nthat convinced her again of unjust suspicions. But it was convincement\nthrough an obstinate faith. She shuddered as she accepted it, and that\nshudder was the nucleus of a terrible revolt.\n\nJane turned into one of the wide lanes leading from the main street and\nentered a huge, shady yard. Here were sweet-smelling clover, alfalfa,\nflowers, and vegetables, all growing in happy confusion. And like these\nfresh green things were the dozens of babies, tots, toddlers, noisy\nurchins, laughing girls, a whole multitude of children of one family.\nFor Collier Brandt, the father of all this numerous progeny, was a\nMormon with four wives.\n\nThe big house where they lived was old, solid, picturesque the lower\npart built of logs, the upper of rough clapboards, with vines growing\nup the outside stone chimneys. There were many wooden-shuttered windows,\nand one pretentious window of glass proudly curtained in white. As this\nhouse had four mistresses, it likewise had four separate sections, not\none of which communicated with another, and all had to be entered from\nthe outside.\n\nIn the shade of a wide, low, vine-roofed porch Jane found Brandt's wives\nentertaining Bishop Dyer. They were motherly women, of comparatively\nsimilar ages, and plain-featured, and just at this moment anything but\ngrave. The Bishop was rather tall, of stout build, with iron-gray hair\nand beard, and eyes of light blue. They were merry now; but Jane had\nseen them when they were not, and then she feared him as she had feared\nher father.\n\nThe women flocked around her in welcome.\n\n\"Daughter of Withersteen,\" said the Bishop, gaily, as he took her hand,\n\"you have not been prodigal of your gracious self of late. A Sabbath\nwithout you at service! I shall reprove Elder Tull.\"\n\n\"Bishop, the guilt is mine. I'll come to you and confess,\" Jane replied,\nlightly; but she felt the undercurrent of her words.\n\n\"Mormon love-making!\" exclaimed the Bishop, rubbing his hands. \"Tull\nkeeps you all to himself.\"\n\n\"No. He is not courting me.\"\n\n\"What? The laggard! If he does not make haste I'll go a-courting myself\nup to Withersteen House.\"\n\nThere was laughter and further bantering by the Bishop, and then mild\ntalk of village affairs, after which he took his leave, and Jane was\nleft with her friend, Mary Brandt.\n\n\"Jane, you're not yourself. Are you sad about the rustling of the\ncattle? But you have so many, you are so rich.\"\n\nThen Jane confided in her, telling much, yet holding back her doubts of\nfear.\n\n\"Oh, why don't you marry Tull and be one of us?\n\n\"But, Mary, I don't love Tull,\" said Jane, stubbornly.\n\n\"I don't blame you for that. But, Jane Withersteen, you've got to choose\nbetween the love of man and love of God. Often we Mormon women have to\ndo that. It's not easy. The kind of happiness you want I wanted once. I\nnever got it, nor will you, unless you throw away your soul. We've all\nwatched your affair with Venters in fear and trembling. Some dreadful\nthing will come of it. You don't want him hanged or shot--or treated\nworse, as that Gentile boy was treated in Glaze for fooling round a\nMormon woman. Marry Tull. It's your duty as a Mormon. You'll feel no\nrapture as his wife--but think of Heaven! Mormon women don't marry for\nwhat they expect on earth. Take up the cross, Jane. Remember your father\nfound Amber Spring, built these old houses, brought Mormons here, and\nfathered them. You are the daughter of Withersteen!\"\n\nJane left Mary Brandt and went to call upon other friends. They received\nher with the same glad welcome as had Mary, lavished upon her the\npent-up affection of Mormon women, and let her go with her ears ringing\nof Tull, Venters, Lassiter, of duty to God and glory in Heaven.\n\n\"Verily,\" murmured Jane, \"I don't know myself when, through all this, I\nremain unchanged--nay, more fixed of purpose.\"\n\nShe returned to the main street and bent her thoughtful steps toward the\ncenter of the village. A string of wagons drawn by oxen was lumbering\nalong. These \"sage-freighters,\" as they were called, hauled grain and\nflour and merchandise from Sterling, and Jane laughed suddenly in the\nmidst of her humility at the thought that they were her property, as was\none of the three stores for which they freighted goods. The water that\nflowed along the path at her feet, and turned into each cottage-yard to\nnourish garden and orchard, also was hers, no less her private property\nbecause she chose to give it free. Yet in this village of Cottonwoods,\nwhich her father had founded and which she maintained she was not her\nown mistress; she was not able to abide by her own choice of a husband.\nShe was the daughter of Withersteen. Suppose she proved it, imperiously!\nBut she quelled that proud temptation at its birth.\n\nNothing could have replaced the affection which the village people had\nfor her; no power could have made her happy as the pleasure her presence\ngave. As she went on down the street past the stores with their rude\nplatform entrances, and the saloons where tired horses stood with\nbridles dragging, she was again assured of what was the bread and wine\nof life to her--that she was loved. Dirty boys playing in the ditch,\nclerks, teamsters, riders, loungers on the corners, ranchers on dusty\nhorses, little girls running errands, and women hurrying to the stores\nall looked up at her coming with glad eyes.\n\nJane's various calls and wandering steps at length led her to the\nGentile quarter of the village. This was at the extreme southern end,\nand here some thirty Gentile families lived in huts and shacks and\nlog-cabins and several dilapidated cottages. The fortunes of these\ninhabitants of Cottonwoods could be read in their abodes. Water they had\nin abundance, and therefore grass and fruit-trees and patches of alfalfa\nand vegetable gardens. Some of the men and boys had a few stray cattle,\nothers obtained such intermittent employment as the Mormons reluctantly\ntendered them. But none of the families was prosperous, many were very\npoor, and some lived only by Jane Withersteen's beneficence.\n\nAs it made Jane happy to go among her own people, so it saddened her to\ncome in contact with these Gentiles. Yet that was not because she was\nunwelcome; here she was gratefully received by the women, passionately\nby the children. But poverty and idleness, with their attendant\nwretchedness and sorrow, always hurt her. That she could alleviate this\ndistress more now than ever before proved the adage that it was an ill\nwind that blew nobody good. While her Mormon riders were in her employ\nshe had found few Gentiles who would stay with her, and now she was able\nto find employment for all the men and boys. No little shock was it to\nhave man after man tell her that he dare not accept her kind offer.\n\n\"It won't do,\" said one Carson, an intelligent man who had seen better\ndays. \"We've had our warning. Plain and to the point! Now there's\nJudkins, he packs guns, and he can use them, and so can the daredevil\nboys he's hired. But they've little responsibility. Can we risk having\nour homes burned in our absence?\"\n\nJane felt the stretching and chilling of the skin of her face as the\nblood left it.\n\n\"Carson, you and the others rent these houses?\" she asked.\n\n\"You ought to know, Miss Withersteen. Some of them are yours.\"\n\n\"I know?... Carson, I never in my life took a day's labor for rent or a\nyearling calf or a bunch of grass, let alone gold.\"\n\n\"Bivens, your store-keeper, sees to that.\"\n\n\"Look here, Carson,\" went on Jane, hurriedly, and now her cheeks\nwere burning. \"You and Black and Willet pack your goods and move your\nfamilies up to my cabins in the grove. They're far more comfortable than\nthese. Then go to work for me. And if aught happens to you there I'll\ngive you money--gold enough to leave Utah!\"\n\nThe man choked and stammered, and then, as tears welled into his eyes,\nhe found the use of his tongue and cursed. No gentle speech could ever\nhave equaled that curse in eloquent expression of what he felt for Jane\nWithersteen. How strangely his look and tone reminded her of Lassiter!\n\n\"No, it won't do,\" he said, when he had somewhat recovered himself.\n\"Miss Withersteen, there are things that you don't know, and there's not\na soul among us who can tell you.\"\n\n\"I seem to be learning many things, Carson. Well, then, will you let me\naid you--say till better times?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" he replied, with his face lighting up. \"I see what it\nmeans to you, and you know what it means to me. Thank you! And if better\ntimes ever come, I'll be only too happy to work for you.\"\n\n\"Better times will come. I trust God and have faith in man. Good day,\nCarson.\"\n\nThe lane opened out upon the sage-inclosed alfalfa fields, and the last\nhabitation, at the end of that lane of hovels, was the meanest.\nFormerly it had been a shed; now it was a home. The broad leaves of a\nwide-spreading cottonwood sheltered the sunken roof of weathered boards.\nLike an Indian hut, it had one floor. Round about it were a few scanty\nrows of vegetables, such as the hand of a weak woman had time and\nstrength to cultivate. This little dwelling-place was just outside the\nvillage limits, and the widow who lived there had to carry her water\nfrom the nearest irrigation ditch. As Jane Withersteen entered the\nunfenced yard a child saw her, shrieked with joy, and came tearing\ntoward her with curls flying. This child was a little girl of four\ncalled Fay. Her name suited her, for she was an elf, a sprite, a\ncreature so fairy-like and beautiful that she seemed unearthly.\n\n\"Muvver sended for oo,\" cried Fay, as Jane kissed her, \"an' oo never\ntome.\"\n\n\"I didn't know, Fay; but I've come now.\"\n\nFay was a child of outdoors, of the garden and ditch and field, and she\nwas dirty and ragged. But rags and dirt did not hide her beauty. The\none thin little bedraggled garment she wore half covered her fine, slim\nbody. Red as cherries were her cheeks and lips; her eyes were violet\nblue, and the crown of her childish loveliness was the curling golden\nhair. All the children of Cottonwoods were Jane Withersteen's friends,\nshe loved them all. But Fay was dearest to her. Fay had few playmates,\nfor among the Gentile children there were none near her age, and the\nMormon children were forbidden to play with her. So she was a shy, wild,\nlonely child.\n\n\"Muvver's sick,\" said Fay, leading Jane toward the door of the hut.\n\nJane went in. There was only one room, rather dark and bare, but it was\nclean and neat. A woman lay upon a bed.\n\n\"Mrs. Larkin, how are you?\" asked Jane, anxiously.\n\n\"I've been pretty bad for a week, but I'm better now.\"\n\n\"You haven't been here all alone--with no one to wait on you?\"\n\n\"Oh no! My women neighbors are kind. They take turns coming in.\"\n\n\"Did you send for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, several times.\"\n\n\"But I had no word--no messages ever got to me.\"\n\n\"I sent the boys, and they left word with your women that I was ill and\nwould you please come.\"\n\nA sudden deadly sickness seized Jane. She fought the weakness, as she\nfought to be above suspicious thoughts, and it passed, leaving her\nconscious of her utter impotence. That, too, passed as her spirit\nrebounded. But she had again caught a glimpse of dark underhand\ndomination, running its secret lines this time into her own household.\nLike a spider in the blackness of night an unseen hand had begun to run\nthese dark lines, to turn and twist them about her life, to plait\nand weave a web. Jane Withersteen knew it now, and in the realization\nfurther coolness and sureness came to her, and the fighting courage of\nher ancestors.\n\n\"Mrs. Larkin, you're better, and I'm so glad,\" said Jane. \"But may I\nnot do something for you--a turn at nursing, or send you things, or take\ncare of Fay?\"\n\n\"You're so good. Since my husband's been gone what would have become of\nFay and me but for you? It was about Fay that I wanted to speak to you.\nThis time I thought surely I'd die, and I was worried about Fay. Well,\nI'll be around all right shortly, but my strength's gone and I won't\nlive long. So I may as well speak now. You remember you've been asking\nme to let you take Fay and bring her up as your daughter?\"\n\n\"Indeed yes, I remember. I'll be happy to have her. But I hope the\nday--\"\n\n\"Never mind that. The day'll come--sooner or later. I refused your\noffer, and now I'll tell you why.\"\n\n\"I know why,\" interposed Jane. \"It's because you don't want her brought\nup as a Mormon.\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't altogether that.\" Mrs. Larkin raised her thin hand and\nlaid it appealingly on Jane's. \"I don't like to tell you. But--it's\nthis: I told all my friends what you wanted. They know you, care for\nyou, and they said for me to trust Fay to you. Women will talk, you\nknow. It got to the ears of Mormons--gossip of your love for Fay and\nyour wanting her. And it came straight back to me, in jealousy, perhaps,\nthat you wouldn't take Fay as much for love of her as because of your\nreligious duty to bring up another girl for some Mormon to marry.\"\n\n\"That's a damnable lie!\" cried Jane Withersteen.\n\n\"It was what made me hesitate,\" went on Mrs. Larkin, \"but I never\nbelieved it at heart. And now I guess I'll let you--\"\n\n\"Wait! Mrs. Larkin, I may have told little white lies in my life, but\nnever a lie that mattered, that hurt any one. Now believe me. I love\nlittle Fay. If I had her near me I'd grow to worship her. When I asked\nfor her I thought only of that love.... Let me prove this. You and Fay\ncome to live with me. I've such a big house, and I'm so lonely. I'll\nhelp nurse you, take care of you. When you're better you can work for\nme. I'll keep little Fay and bring her up--without Mormon teaching.\nWhen she's grown, if she should want to leave me, I'll send her, and not\nempty-handed, back to Illinois where you came from. I promise you.\"\n\n\"I knew it was a lie,\" replied the mother, and she sank back upon\nher pillow with something of peace in her white, worn face. \"Jane\nWithersteen, may Heaven bless you! I've been deeply grateful to you. But\nbecause you're a Mormon I never felt close to you till now. I don't know\nmuch about religion as religion, but your God and my God are the same.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. SURPRISE VALLEY\n\nBack in that strange canyon, which Venters had found indeed a valley of\nsurprises, the wounded girl's whispered appeal, almost a prayer, not to\ntake her back to the rustlers crowned the events of the last few days\nwith a confounding climax. That she should not want to return to them\nstaggered Venters. Presently, as logical thought returned, her appeal\nconfirmed his first impression--that she was more unfortunate than\nbad--and he experienced a sensation of gladness. If he had known before\nthat Oldring's Masked Rider was a woman his opinion would have been\nformed and he would have considered her abandoned. But his first\nknowledge had come when he lifted a white face quivering in a convulsion\nof agony; he had heard God's name whispered by blood-stained lips;\nthrough her solemn and awful eyes he had caught a glimpse\nof her soul. And just now had come the entreaty to him,\n\"Don't--take--me--back--there!\"\n\nOnce for all Venters's quick mind formed a permanent conception of this\npoor girl. He based it, not upon what the chances of life had made her,\nbut upon the revelation of dark eyes that pierced the infinite, upon a\nfew pitiful, halting words that betrayed failure and wrong and misery,\nyet breathed the truth of a tragic fate rather than a natural leaning to\nevil.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Bess,\" she answered.\n\n\"Bess what?\"\n\n\"That's enough--just Bess.\"\n\nThe red that deepened in her cheeks was not all the flush of fever.\nVenters marveled anew, and this time at the tint of shame in her face,\nat the momentary drooping of long lashes. She might be a rustler's girl,\nbut she was still capable of shame, she might be dying, but she still\nclung to some little remnant of honor.\n\n\"Very well, Bess. It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"But this matters--what\nshall I do with you?\"\n\n\"Are--you--a rider?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Not now. I was once. I drove the Withersteen herds. But I lost my\nplace--lost all I owned--and now I'm--I'm a sort of outcast. My name's\nBern Venters.\"\n\n\"You won't--take me--to Cottonwoods--or Glaze? I'd be--hanged.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. But I must do something with you. For it's not safe for\nme here. I shot that rustler who was with you. Sooner or later he'll\nbe found, and then my tracks. I must find a safer hiding-place where I\ncan't be trailed.\"\n\n\"Leave me--here.\"\n\n\"Alone--to die!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I will not.\" Venters spoke shortly with a kind of ring in his voice.\n\n\"What--do you want--to do--with me?\" Her whispering grew difficult, so\nlow and faint that Venters had to stoop to hear her.\n\n\"Why, let's see,\" he replied, slowly. \"I'd like to take you some place\nwhere I could watch by you, nurse you, till you're all right.\"\n\n\"And--then?\"\n\n\"Well, it'll be time to think of that when you're cured of your wound.\nIt's a bad one. And--Bess, if you don't want to live--if you don't fight\nfor life--you'll never--\"\n\n\"Oh! I want--to live! I'm afraid--to die. But I'd rather--die--than go\nback--to--to--\"\n\n\"To Oldring?\" asked Venters, interrupting her in turn.\n\nHer lips moved in an affirmative.\n\n\"I promise not to take you back to him or to Cottonwoods or to Glaze.\"\n\nThe mournful earnestness of her gaze suddenly shone with unutterable\ngratitude and wonder. And as suddenly Venters found her eyes beautiful\nas he had never seen or felt beauty. They were as dark blue as the sky\nat night. Then the flashing changed to a long, thoughtful look, in which\nthere was a wistful, unconscious searching of his face, a look that\ntrembled on the verge of hope and trust.\n\n\"I'll try--to live,\" she said. The broken whisper just reached his ears.\n\"Do what--you want--with me.\"\n\n\"Rest then--don't worry--sleep,\" he replied.\n\nAbruptly he arose, as if words had been decision for him, and with a\nsharp command to the dogs he strode from the camp. Venters was conscious\nof an indefinite conflict of change within him. It seemed to be a\nvague passing of old moods, a dim coalescing of new forces, a moment of\ninexplicable transition. He was both cast down and uplifted. He wanted\nto think and think of the meaning, but he resolutely dispelled emotion.\nHis imperative need at present was to find a safe retreat, and this\ncalled for action.\n\nSo he set out. It still wanted several hours before dark. This trip he\nturned to the left and wended his skulking way southward a mile or more\nto the opening of the valley, where lay the strange scrawled rocks. He\ndid not, however, venture boldly out into the open sage, but clung to\nthe right-hand wall and went along that till its perpendicular line\nbroke into the long incline of bare stone.\n\nBefore proceeding farther he halted, studying the strange character of\nthis slope and realizing that a moving black object could be seen far\nagainst such background. Before him ascended a gradual swell of smooth\nstone. It was hard, polished, and full of pockets worn by centuries\nof eddying rain-water. A hundred yards up began a line of grotesque\ncedar-trees, and they extended along the slope clear to its most\nsoutherly end. Beyond that end Venters wanted to get, and he concluded\nthe cedars, few as they were, would afford some cover.\n\nTherefore he climbed swiftly. The trees were farther up than he\nhad estimated, though he had from long habit made allowance for the\ndeceiving nature of distances in that country. When he gained the cover\nof cedars he paused to rest and look, and it was then he saw how the\ntrees sprang from holes in the bare rock. Ages of rain had run down the\nslope, circling, eddying in depressions, wearing deep round holes.\nThere had been dry seasons, accumulations of dust, wind-blown seeds, and\ncedars rose wonderfully out of solid rock. But these were not beautiful\ncedars. They were gnarled, twisted into weird contortions, as if growth\nwere torture, dead at the tops, shrunken, gray, and old. Theirs had\nbeen a bitter fight, and Venters felt a strange sympathy for them. This\ncountry was hard on trees--and men.\n\nHe slipped from cedar to cedar, keeping them between him and the open\nvalley. As he progressed, the belt of trees widened and he kept to its\nupper margin. He passed shady pockets half full of water, and, as he\nmarked the location for possible future need, he reflected that there\nhad been no rain since the winter snows. From one of these shady holes a\nrabbit hopped out and squatted down, laying its ears flat.\n\nVenters wanted fresh meat now more than when he had only himself to\nthink of. But it would not do to fire his rifle there. So he broke off\na cedar branch and threw it. He crippled the rabbit, which started to\nflounder up the slope. Venters did not wish to lose the meat, and\nhe never allowed crippled game to escape, to die lingeringly in some\ncovert. So after a careful glance below, and back toward the canyon, he\nbegan to chase the rabbit.\n\nThe fact that rabbits generally ran uphill was not new to him. But\nit presently seemed singular why this rabbit, that might have escaped\ndownward, chose to ascend the slope. Venters knew then that it had a\nburrow higher up. More than once he jerked over to seize it, only in\nvain, for the rabbit by renewed effort eluded his grasp. Thus the chase\ncontinued on up the bare slope. The farther Venters climbed the more\ndetermined he grew to catch his quarry. At last, panting and sweating,\nhe captured the rabbit at the foot of a steeper grade. Laying his rifle\non the bulge of rising stone, he killed the animal and slung it from his\nbelt.\n\nBefore starting down he waited to catch his breath. He had climbed\nfar up that wonderful smooth slope, and had almost reached the base\nof yellow cliff that rose skyward, a huge scarred and cracked bulk. It\nfrowned down upon him as if to forbid further ascent. Venters bent over\nfor his rifle, and, as he picked it up from where it leaned against the\nsteeper grade, he saw several little nicks cut in the solid stone.\n\nThey were only a few inches deep and about a foot apart. Venters began\nto count them--one--two--three--four--on up to sixteen. That number\ncarried his glance to the top of his first bulging bench of cliff-base.\nAbove, after a more level offset, was still steeper slope, and the line\nof nicks kept on, to wind round a projecting corner of wall.\n\nA casual glance would have passed by these little dents; if Venters had\nnot known what they signified he would never have bestowed upon them the\nsecond glance. But he knew they had been cut there by hand, and,\nthough age-worn, he recognized them as steps cut in the rock by the\ncliff-dwellers. With a pulse beginning to beat and hammer away his\ncalmness, he eyed that indistinct line of steps, up to where the\nbuttress of wall hid further sight of them. He knew that behind\nthe corner of stone would be a cave or a crack which could never be\nsuspected from below. Chance, that had sported with him of late, now\ndirected him to a probable hiding-place. Again he laid aside his rifle,\nand, removing boots and belt, he began to walk up the steps. Like a\nmountain goat, he was agile, sure-footed, and he mounted the first bench\nwithout bending to use his hands. The next ascent took grip of fingers\nas well as toes, but he climbed steadily, swiftly, to reach the\nprojecting corner, and slipped around it. Here he faced a notch in the\ncliff. At the apex he turned abruptly into a ragged vent that split the\nponderous wall clear to the top, showing a narrow streak of blue sky.\n\nAt the base this vent was dark, cool, and smelled of dry, musty dust.\nIt zigzagged so that he could not see ahead more than a few yards at a\ntime. He noticed tracks of wildcats and rabbits in the dusty floor. At\nevery turn he expected to come upon a huge cavern full of little square\nstone houses, each with a small aperture like a staring dark eye. The\npassage lightened and widened, and opened at the foot of a narrow,\nsteep, ascending chute.\n\nVenters had a moment's notice of the rock, which was of the same\nsmoothness and hardness as the slope below, before his gaze went\nirresistibly upward to the precipitous walls of this wide ladder of\ngranite. These were ruined walls of yellow sandstone, and so split and\nsplintered, so overhanging with great sections of balancing rim, so\nimpending with tremendous crumbling crags, that Venters caught his\nbreath sharply, and, appalled, he instinctively recoiled as if a step\nupward might jar the ponderous cliffs from their foundation. Indeed, it\nseemed that these ruined cliffs were but awaiting a breath of wind\nto collapse and come tumbling down. Venters hesitated. It would be a\nfoolhardy man who risked his life under the leaning, waiting avalanches\nof rock in that gigantic split. Yet how many years had they leaned there\nwithout falling! At the bottom of the incline was an immense heap of\nweathered sandstone all crumbling to dust, but there were no huge rocks\nas large as houses, such as rested so lightly and frightfully above,\nwaiting patiently and inevitably to crash down. Slowly split from the\nparent rock by the weathering process, and carved and sculptured by ages\nof wind and rain, they waited their moment. Venters felt how foolish\nit was for him to fear these broken walls; to fear that, after they had\nendured for thousands of years, the moment of his passing should be the\none for them to slip. Yet he feared it.\n\n\"What a place to hide!\" muttered Venters. \"I'll climb--I'll see where\nthis thing goes. If only I can find water!\"\n\nWith teeth tight shut he essayed the incline. And as he climbed he bent\nhis eyes downward. This, however, after a little grew impossible; he had\nto look to obey his eager, curious mind. He raised his glance and saw\nlight between row on row of shafts and pinnacles and crags that stood\nout from the main wall. Some leaned against the cliff, others against\neach other; many stood sheer and alone; all were crumbling, cracked,\nrotten. It was a place of yellow, ragged ruin. The passage narrowed as\nhe went up; it became a slant, hard for him to stick on; it was smooth\nas marble. Finally he surmounted it, surprised to find the walls still\nseveral hundred feet high, and a narrow gorge leading down on the other\nside. This was a divide between two inclines, about twenty yards wide.\nAt one side stood an enormous rock. Venters gave it a second glance,\nbecause it rested on a pedestal. It attracted closer attention. It was\nlike a colossal pear of stone standing on its stem. Around the bottom\nwere thousands of little nicks just distinguishable to the eye. They\nwere marks of stone hatchets. The cliff-dwellers had chipped and chipped\naway at this boulder till it rested its tremendous bulk upon a mere\npin-point of its surface. Venters pondered. Why had the little stone-men\nhacked away at that big boulder? It bore no semblance to a statue or an\nidol or a godhead or a sphinx. Instinctively he put his hands on it\nand pushed; then his shoulder and heaved. The stone seemed to groan, to\nstir, to grate, and then to move. It tipped a little downward and hung\nbalancing for a long instant, slowly returned, rocked slightly, groaned,\nand settled back to its former position.\n\nVenters divined its significance. It had been meant for defense. The\ncliff-dwellers, driven by dreaded enemies to this last stand, had\ncunningly cut the rock until it balanced perfectly, ready to be\ndislodged by strong hands. Just below it leaned a tottering crag that\nwould have toppled, starting an avalanche on an acclivity where no\nsliding mass could stop. Crags and pinnacles, splintered cliffs, and\nleaning shafts and monuments, would have thundered down to block forever\nthe outlet to Deception Pass.\n\n\"That was a narrow shave for me,\" said Venters, soberly. \"A balancing\nrock! The cliff-dwellers never had to roll it. They died, vanished,\nand here the rock stands, probably little changed.... But it might serve\nanother lonely dweller of the cliffs. I'll hide up here somewhere, if I\ncan only find water.\"\n\nHe descended the gorge on the other side. The slope was gradual, the\nspace narrow, the course straight for many rods. A gloom hung between\nthe up-sweeping walls. In a turn the passage narrowed to scarce a dozen\nfeet, and here was darkness of night. But light shone ahead; another\nabrupt turn brought day again, and then wide open space.\n\nAbove Venters loomed a wonderful arch of stone bridging the canyon rims,\nand through the enormous round portal gleamed and glistened a beautiful\nvalley shining under sunset gold reflected by surrounding cliffs. He\ngave a start of surprise. The valley was a cove a mile long, half\nthat wide, and its enclosing walls were smooth and stained, and curved\ninward, forming great caves. He decided that its floor was far higher\nthan the level of Deception Pass and the intersecting canyons. No purple\nsage colored this valley floor. Instead there were the white of aspens,\nstreaks of branch and slender trunk glistening from the green of leaves,\nand the darker green of oaks, and through the middle of this forest,\nfrom wall to wall, ran a winding line of brilliant green which marked\nthe course of cottonwoods and willows.\n\n\"There's water here--and this is the place for me,\" said Venters. \"Only\nbirds can peep over those walls, I've gone Oldring one better.\"\n\nVenters waited no longer, and turned swiftly to retrace his steps. He\nnamed the canyon Surprise Valley and the huge boulder that guarded the\noutlet Balancing Rock. Going down he did not find himself attended by\nsuch fears as had beset him in the climb; still, he was not easy in\nmind and could not occupy himself with plans of moving the girl and his\noutfit until he had descended to the notch. There he rested a moment and\nlooked about him. The pass was darkening with the approach of night. At\nthe corner of the wall, where the stone steps turned, he saw a spur of\nrock that would serve to hold the noose of a lasso. He needed no more\naid to scale that place. As he intended to make the move under cover\nof darkness, he wanted most to be able to tell where to climb up. So,\ntaking several small stones with him, he stepped and slid down to the\nedge of the slope where he had left his rifle and boots. He placed the\nstones some yards apart. He left the rabbit lying upon the bench where\nthe steps began. Then he addressed a keen-sighted, remembering gaze to\nthe rim-wall above. It was serrated, and between two spears of rock,\ndirectly in line with his position, showed a zigzag crack that at night\nwould let through the gleam of sky. This settled, he put on his belt\nand boots and prepared to descend. Some consideration was necessary to\ndecide whether or not to leave his rifle there. On the return, carrying\nthe girl and a pack, it would be added encumbrance; and after debating\nthe matter he left the rifle leaning against the bench. As he went\nstraight down the slope he halted every few rods to look up at his mark\non the rim. It changed, but he fixed each change in his memory. When he\nreached the first cedar-tree, he tied his scarf upon a dead branch, and\nthen hurried toward camp, having no more concern about finding his trail\nupon the return trip.\n\nDarkness soon emboldened and lent him greater speed. It occurred to him,\nas he glided into the grassy glade near camp and head the whinny of a\nhorse, that he had forgotten Wrangle. The big sorrel could not be gotten\ninto Surprise Valley. He would have to be left here.\n\nVenters determined at once to lead the other horses out through the\nthicket and turn them loose. The farther they wandered from this canyon\nthe better it would suit him. He easily descried Wrangle through the\ngloom, but the others were not in sight. Venters whistled low for the\ndogs, and when they came trotting to him he sent them out to search for\nthe horses, and followed. It soon developed that they were not in the\nglade nor the thicket. Venters grew cold and rigid at the thought of\nrustlers having entered his retreat. But the thought passed, for the\ndemeanor of Ring and Whitie reassured him. The horses had wandered away.\n\nUnder the clump of silver spruces a denser mantle of darkness, yet not\nso thick that Venter's night-practiced eyes could not catch the white\noval of a still face. He bent over it with a slight suspension of breath\nthat was both caution lest he frighten her and chill uncertainty of\nfeeling lest he find her dead. But she slept, and he arose to renewed\nactivity.\n\nHe packed his saddle-bags. The dogs were hungry, they whined about\nhim and nosed his busy hands; but he took no time to feed them nor to\nsatisfy his own hunger. He slung the saddlebags over his shoulders and\nmade them secure with his lasso. Then he wrapped the blankets closer\nabout the girl and lifted her in his arms. Wrangle whinnied and thumped\nthe ground as Venters passed him with the dogs. The sorrel knew he was\nbeing left behind, and was not sure whether he liked it or not. Venters\nwent on and entered the thicket. Here he had to feel his way in pitch\nblackness and to wedge his progress between the close saplings. Time\nmeant little to him now that he had started, and he edged along with\nslow side movement till he got clear of the thicket. Ring and Whitie\nstood waiting for him. Taking to the open aisles and patches of the\nsage, he walked guardedly, careful not to stumble or step in dust or\nstrike against spreading sage-branches.\n\nIf he were burdened he did not feel it. From time to time, when he\npassed out of the black lines of shade into the wan starlight, he\nglanced at the white face of the girl lying in his arms. She had not\nawakened from her sleep or stupor. He did not rest until he cleared the\nblack gate of the canyon. Then he leaned against a stone breast-high to\nhim and gently released the girl from his hold. His brow and hair\nand the palms of his hands were wet, and there was a kind of nervous\ncontraction of his muscles. They seemed to ripple and string tense. He\nhad a desire to hurry and no sense of fatigue. A wind blew the scent\nof sage in his face. The first early blackness of night passed with the\nbrightening of the stars. Somewhere back on his trail a coyote yelped,\nsplitting the dead silence. Venters's faculties seemed singularly acute.\n\nHe lifted the girl again and pressed on. The valley better traveling\nthan the canyon. It was lighter, freer of sage, and there were no rocks.\nSoon, out of the pale gloom shone a still paler thing, and that was the\nlow swell of slope. Venters mounted it and his dogs walked beside him.\nOnce upon the stone he slowed to snail pace, straining his sight to\navoid the pockets and holes. Foot by foot he went up. The weird cedars,\nlike great demons and witches chained to the rock and writhing in silent\nanguish, loomed up with wide and twisting naked arms. Venters crossed\nthis belt of cedars, skirted the upper border, and recognized the tree\nhe had marked, even before he saw his waving scarf.\n\nHere he knelt and deposited the girl gently, feet first and slowly laid\nher out full length. What he feared was to reopen one of her wounds.\nIf he gave her a violent jar, or slipped and fell! But the supreme\nconfidence so strangely felt that night admitted no such blunders.\n\nThe slope before him seemed to swell into obscurity to lose its definite\noutline in a misty, opaque cloud that shaded into the over-shadowing\nwall. He scanned the rim where the serrated points speared the sky, and\nhe found the zigzag crack. It was dim, only a shade lighter than the\ndark ramparts, but he distinguished it, and that served.\n\nLifting the girl, he stepped upward, closely attending to the nature of\nthe path under his feet. After a few steps he stopped to mark his line\nwith the crack in the rim. The dogs clung closer to him. While chasing\nthe rabbit this slope had appeared interminable to him; now, burdened as\nhe was, he did not think of length or height or toil. He remembered\nonly to avoid a misstep and to keep his direction. He climbed on, with\nfrequent stops to watch the rim, and before he dreamed of gaining the\nbench he bumped his knees into it, and saw, in the dim gray light, his\nrifle and the rabbit. He had come straight up without mishap or swerving\noff his course, and his shut teeth unlocked.\n\nAs he laid the girl down in the shallow hollow of the little ridge with\nher white face upturned, she opened her eyes. Wide, staring black, at\nonce like both the night and the stars, they made her face seem still\nwhiter.\n\n\"Is--it--you?\" she asked, faintly.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Venters.\n\n\"Oh! Where--are we?\"\n\n\"I'm taking you to a safe place where no one will ever find you. I must\nclimb a little here and call the dogs. Don't be afraid. I'll soon come\nfor you.\"\n\nShe said no more. Her eyes watched him steadily for a moment and then\nclosed. Venters pulled off his boots and then felt for the little steps\nin the rock. The shade of the cliff above obscured the point he wanted\nto gain, but he could see dimly a few feet before him. What he had\nattempted with care he now went at with surpassing lightness. Buoyant,\nrapid, sure, he attained the corner of wall and slipped around it. Here\nhe could not see a hand before his face, so he groped along, found a\nlittle flat space, and there removed the saddle-bags. The lasso he took\nback with him to the corner and looped the noose over the spur of rock.\n\n\"Ring--Whitie--come,\" he called, softly.\n\nLow whines came up from below.\n\n\"Here! Come, Whitie--Ring,\" he repeated, this time sharply.\n\nThen followed scraping of claws and pattering of feet; and out of the\ngray gloom below him swiftly climbed the dogs to reach his side and pass\nbeyond.\n\nVenters descended, holding to the lasso. He tested its strength by\nthrowing all his weight upon it. Then he gathered the girl up, and,\nholding her securely in his left arm, he began to climb, at every few\nsteps jerking his right hand upward along the lasso. It sagged at each\nforward movement he made, but he balanced himself lightly during the\ninterval when he lacked the support of a taut rope. He climbed as if he\nhad wings, the strength of a giant, and knew not the sense of fear. The\nsharp corner of cliff seemed to cut out of the darkness. He reached\nit and the protruding shelf, and then, entering the black shade of the\nnotch, he moved blindly but surely to the place where he had left the\nsaddle-bags. He heard the dogs, though he could not see them. Once more\nhe carefully placed the girl at his feet. Then, on hands and knees,\nhe went over the little flat space, feeling for stones. He removed a\nnumber, and, scraping the deep dust into a heap, he unfolded the outer\nblanket from around the girl and laid her upon this bed. Then he went\ndown the slope again for his boots, rifle, and the rabbit, and, bringing\nalso his lasso with him, he made short work of that trip.\n\n\"Are--you--there?\" The girl's voice came low from the blackness.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, and was conscious that his laboring breast made\nspeech difficult.\n\n\"Are we--in a cave?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, listen!... The waterfall!... I hear it! You've brought me back!\"\n\nVenters heard a murmuring moan that one moment swelled to a pitch almost\nsoftly shrill and the next lulled to a low, almost inaudible sigh.\n\n\"That's--wind blowing--in the--cliffs,\" he panted. \"You're far from\nOldring's--canyon.\"\n\nThe effort it cost him to speak made him conscious of extreme lassitude\nfollowing upon great exertion. It seemed that when he lay down and drew\nhis blanket over him the action was the last before utter prostration.\nHe stretched inert, wet, hot, his body one great strife of throbbing,\nstinging nerves and bursting veins. And there he lay for a long while\nbefore he felt that he had begun to rest.\n\nRest came to him that night, but no sleep. Sleep he did not want. The\nhours of strained effort were now as if they had never been, and he\nwanted to think. Earlier in the day he had dismissed an inexplicable\nfeeling of change; but now, when there was no longer demand on his\ncunning and strength and he had time to think, he could not catch the\nillusive thing that had sadly perplexed as well as elevated his spirit.\n\nAbove him, through a V-shaped cleft in the dark rim of the cliff, shone\nthe lustrous stars that had been his lonely accusers for a long, long\nyear. To-night they were different. He studied them. Larger, whiter,\nmore radiant they seemed; but that was not the difference he meant.\nGradually it came to him that the distinction was not one he saw, but\none he felt. In this he divined as much of the baffling change as he\nthought would be revealed to him then. And as he lay there, with the\nsinging of the cliff-winds in his ears, the white stars above the dark,\nbold vent, the difference which he felt was that he was no longer alone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. SILVER SPRUCE AND ASPENS\n\nThe rest of that night seemed to Venters only a few moments of\nstarlight, a dark overcasting of sky, an hour or so of gray gloom, and\nthen the lighting of dawn.\n\nWhen he had bestirred himself, feeding the hungry dogs and breaking\nhis long fast, and had repacked his saddle-bags, it was clear daylight,\nthough the sun had not tipped the yellow wall in the east. He concluded\nto make the climb and descent into Surprise Valley in one trip. To that\nend he tied his blanket upon Ring and gave Whitie the extra lasso and\nthe rabbit to carry. Then, with the rifle and saddle-bags slung upon his\nback, he took up the girl. She did not awaken from heavy slumber.\n\nThat climb up under the rugged, menacing brows of the broken cliffs,\nin the face of a grim, leaning boulder that seemed to be weary of its\nage-long wavering, was a tax on strength and nerve that Venters\nfelt equally with something sweet and strangely exulting in its\naccomplishment. He did not pause until he gained the narrow divide and\nthere he rested. Balancing Rock loomed huge, cold in the gray light\nof dawn, a thing without life, yet it spoke silently to Venters: \"I am\nwaiting to plunge down, to shatter and crash, roar and boom, to bury\nyour trail, and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass!\"\n\nOn the descent of the other side Venters had easy going, but was\nsomewhat concerned because Whitie appeared to have succumbed to\ntemptation, and while carrying the rabbit was also chewing on it. And\nRing evidently regarded this as an injury to himself, especially as he\nhad carried the heavier load. Presently he snapped at one end of the\nrabbit and refused to let go. But his action prevented Whitie from\nfurther misdoing, and then the two dogs pattered down, carrying the\nrabbit between them.\n\nVenters turned out of the gorge, and suddenly paused stock-still,\nastounded at the scene before him. The curve of the great stone bridge\nhad caught the sunrise, and through the magnificent arch burst a\nglorious stream of gold that shone with a long slant down into the\ncenter of Surprise Valley. Only through the arch did any sunlight\npass, so that all the rest of the valley lay still asleep, dark green,\nmysterious, shadowy, merging its level into walls as misty and soft as\nmorning clouds.\n\nVenters then descended, passing through the arch, looking up at its\ntremendous height and sweep. It spanned the opening to Surprise Valley,\nstretching in almost perfect curve from rim to rim. Even in his hurry\nand concern Venters could not but feel its majesty, and the thought came\nto him that the cliff-dwellers must have regarded it as an object of\nworship.\n\nDown, down, down Venters strode, more and more feeling the weight of his\nburden as he descended, and still the valley lay below him. As all\nother canyons and coves and valleys had deceived him, so had this deep,\nnestling oval. At length he passed beyond the slope of weathered stone\nthat spread fan-shape from the arch, and encountered a grassy terrace\nrunning to the right and about on a level with the tips of the oaks and\ncottonwoods below. Scattered here and there upon this shelf were clumps\nof aspens, and he walked through them into a glade that surpassed in\nbeauty and adaptability for a wild home, any place he had ever seen.\nSilver spruces bordered the base of a precipitous wall that rose\nloftily. Caves indented its surface, and there were no detached ledges\nor weathered sections that might dislodge a stone. The level ground,\nbeyond the spruces, dropped down into a little ravine. This was one\ndense line of slender aspens from which came the low splashing of water.\nAnd the terrace, lying open to the west, afforded unobstructed view of\nthe valley of green treetops.\n\nFor his camp Venters chose a shady, grassy plot between the silver\nspruces and the cliff. Here, in the stone wall, had been wonderfully\ncarved by wind or washed by water several deep caves above the level of\nthe terrace. They were clean, dry, roomy.\n\nHe cut spruce boughs and made a bed in the largest cave and laid the\ngirl there. The first intimation that he had of her being aroused from\nsleep or lethargy was a low call for water.\n\nHe hurried down into the ravine with his canteen. It was a shallow,\ngrass-green place with aspens growing up everywhere. To his delight\nhe found a tiny brook of swift-running water. Its faint tinge of amber\nreminded him of the spring at Cottonwoods, and the thought gave him a\nlittle shock. The water was so cold it made his fingers tingle as he\ndipped the canteen. Having returned to the cave, he was glad to see the\ngirl drink thirstily. This time he noted that she could raise her head\nslightly without his help.\n\n\"You were thirsty,\" he said. \"It's good water. I've found a fine place.\nTell me--how do you feel?\"\n\n\"There's pain--here,\" she replied, and moved her hand to her left side.\n\n\"Why, that's strange! Your wounds are on your right side. I believe\nyou're hungry. Is the pain a kind of dull ache--a gnawing?\"\n\n\"It's like--that.\"\n\n\"Then it's hunger.\" Venters laughed, and suddenly caught himself with a\nquick breath and felt again the little shock. When had he laughed? \"It's\nhunger,\" he went on. \"I've had that gnaw many a time. I've got it now.\nBut you mustn't eat. You can have all the water you want, but no food\njust yet.\"\n\n\"Won't I--starve?\"\n\n\"No, people don't starve easily. I've discovered that. You must lie\nperfectly still and rest and sleep--for days.\"\n\n\"My hands--are dirty; my face feels--so hot and sticky; my boots hurt.\"\nIt was her longest speech as yet, and it trailed off in a whisper.\n\n\"Well, I'm a fine nurse!\"\n\nIt annoyed him that he had never thought of these things. But then,\nawaiting her death and thinking of her comfort were vastly different\nmatters. He unwrapped the blanket which covered her. What a slender girl\nshe was! No wonder he had been able to carry her miles and pack her up\nthat slippery ladder of stone. Her boots were of soft, fine leather,\nreaching clear to her knees. He recognized the make as one of a\nboot-maker in Sterling. Her spurs, that he had stupidly neglected to\nremove, consisted of silver frames and gold chains, and the rowels,\nlarge as silver dollars, were fancifully engraved. The boots slipped off\nrather hard. She wore heavy woollen rider's stockings, half length, and\nthese were pulled up over the ends of her short trousers. Venters took\noff the stockings to note her little feet were red and swollen. He\nbathed them. Then he removed his scarf and bathed her face and hands.\n\n\"I must see your wounds now,\" he said, gently.\n\nShe made no reply, but watched him steadily as he opened her blouse and\nuntied the bandage. His strong fingers trembled a little as he removed\nit. If the wounds had reopened! A chill struck him as he saw the angry\nred bullet-mark, and a tiny stream of blood winding from it down her\nwhite breast. Very carefully he lifted her to see that the wound in her\nback had closed perfectly. Then he washed the blood from her breast,\nbathed the wound, and left it unbandaged, open to the air.\n\nHer eyes thanked him.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, earnestly. \"I've had some wounds, and I've seen many.\nI know a little about them. The hole in your back has closed. If you lie\nstill three days the one in your breast will close and you'll be safe.\nThe danger from hemorrhage will be over.\"\n\nHe had spoken with earnest sincerity, almost eagerness.\n\n\"Why--do you--want me--to get well?\" she asked, wonderingly.\n\nThe simple question seemed unanswerable except on grounds of humanity.\nBut the circumstances under which he had shot this strange girl, the\nshock and realization, the waiting for death, the hope, had resulted in\na condition of mind wherein Venters wanted her to live more than he had\never wanted anything. Yet he could not tell why. He believed the killing\nof the rustler and the subsequent excitement had disturbed him. For how\nelse could he explain the throbbing of his brain, the heat of his blood,\nthe undefined sense of full hours, charged, vibrant with pulsating\nmystery where once they had dragged in loneliness?\n\n\"I shot you,\" he said, slowly, \"and I want you to get well so I shall\nnot have killed a woman. But--for your own sake, too--\"\n\nA terrible bitterness darkened her eyes, and her lips quivered.\n\n\"Hush,\" said Venters. \"You've talked too much already.\"\n\nIn her unutterable bitterness he saw a darkness of mood that could not\nhave been caused by her present weak and feverish state. She hated the\nlife she had led, that she probably had been compelled to lead. She\nhad suffered some unforgivable wrong at the hands of Oldring. With that\nconviction Venters felt a shame throughout his body, and it marked the\nrekindling of fierce anger and ruthlessness. In the past long year he\nhad nursed resentment. He had hated the wilderness--the loneliness of\nthe uplands. He had waited for something to come to pass. It had come.\nLike an Indian stealing horses he had skulked into the recesses of the\ncanyons. He had found Oldring's retreat; he had killed a rustler; he had\nshot an unfortunate girl, then had saved her from this unwitting act,\nand he meant to save her from the consequent wasting of blood, from\nfever and weakness. Starvation he had to fight for her and for himself.\nWhere he had been sick at the letting of blood, now he remembered it in\ngrim, cold calm. And as he lost that softness of nature, so he lost his\nfear of men. He would watch for Oldring, biding his time, and he would\nkill this great black-bearded rustler who had held a girl in bondage,\nwho had used her to his infamous ends.\n\nVenters surmised this much of the change in him--idleness had passed;\nkeen, fierce vigor flooded his mind and body; all that had happened to\nhim at Cottonwoods seemed remote and hard to recall; the difficulties\nand perils of the present absorbed him, held him in a kind of spell.\n\nFirst, then, he fitted up the little cave adjoining the girl's room\nfor his own comfort and use. His next work was to build a fireplace of\nstones and to gather a store of wood. That done, he spilled the contents\nof his saddle-bags upon the grass and took stock. His outfit consisted\nof a small-handled axe, a hunting-knife, a large number of cartridges\nfor rifle or revolver, a tin plate, a cup, and a fork and spoon,\na quantity of dried beef and dried fruits, and small canvas bags\ncontaining tea, sugar, salt, and pepper. For him alone this supply would\nhave been bountiful to begin a sojourn in the wilderness, but he was no\nlonger alone. Starvation in the uplands was not an unheard-of thing;\nhe did not, however, worry at all on that score, and feared only his\npossible inability to supply the needs of a woman in a weakened and\nextremely delicate condition.\n\nIf there was no game in the valley--a contingency he doubted--it would\nnot be a great task for him to go by night to Oldring's herd and pack\nout a calf. The exigency of the moment was to ascertain if there were\ngame in Surprise Valley. Whitie still guarded the dilapidated rabbit,\nand Ring slept near by under a spruce. Venters called Ring and went to\nthe edge of the terrace, and there halted to survey the valley.\n\nHe was prepared to find it larger than his unstudied glances had made it\nappear; for more than a casual idea of dimensions and a hasty conception\nof oval shape and singular beauty he had not had time. Again the\nfelicity of the name he had given the valley struck him forcibly. Around\nthe red perpendicular walls, except under the great arc of stone, ran\na terrace fringed at the cliff-base by silver spruces; below that first\nterrace sloped another wider one densely overgrown with aspens, and the\ncenter of the valley was a level circle of oaks and alders, with the\nglittering green line of willows and cottonwood dividing it in half.\nVenters saw a number and variety of birds flitting among the trees.\nTo his left, facing the stone bridge, an enormous cavern opened in the\nwall; and low down, just above the tree-tops, he made out a long shelf\nof cliff-dwellings, with little black, staring windows or doors. Like\neyes they were, and seemed to watch him. The few cliff-dwellings he had\nseen--all ruins--had left him with haunting memory of age and solitude\nand of something past. He had come, in a way, to be a cliff-dweller\nhimself, and those silent eyes would look down upon him, as if in\nsurprise that after thousands of years a man had invaded the valley.\nVenters felt sure that he was the only white man who had ever walked\nunder the shadow of the wonderful stone bridge, down into that wonderful\nvalley with its circle of caves and its terraced rings of silver spruce\nand aspens.\n\nThe dog growled below and rushed into the forest. Venters ran down the\ndeclivity to enter a zone of light shade streaked with sunshine. The\noak-trees were slender, none more than half a foot thick, and they grew\nclose together, intermingling their branches. Ring came running back\nwith a rabbit in his mouth. Venters took the rabbit and, holding the\ndog near him, stole softly on. There were fluttering of wings among the\nbranches and quick bird-notes, and rustling of dead leaves and rapid\npatterings. Venters crossed well-worn trails marked with fresh tracks;\nand when he had stolen on a little farther he saw many birds and running\nquail, and more rabbits than he could count. He had not penetrated the\nforest of oaks for a hundred yards, had not approached anywhere near the\nline of willows and cottonwoods which he knew grew along a stream. But\nhe had seen enough to know that Surprise Valley was the home of many\nwild creatures.\n\nVenters returned to camp. He skinned the rabbits, and gave the dogs the\none they had quarreled over, and the skin of this he dressed and hung\nup to dry, feeling that he would like to keep it. It was a particularly\nrich, furry pelt with a beautiful white tail. Venters remembered that\nbut for the bobbing of that white tail catching his eye he would not\nhave espied the rabbit, and he would never have discovered Surprise\nValley. Little incidents of chance like this had turned him here\nand there in Deception Pass; and now they had assumed to him the\nsignificance and direction of destiny.\n\nHis good fortune in the matter of game at hand brought to his mind the\nnecessity of keeping it in the valley. Therefore he took the axe and cut\nbundles of aspens and willows, and packed them up under the bridge to\nthe narrow outlet of the gorge. Here he began fashioning a fence, by\ndriving aspens into the ground and lacing them fast with willows. Trip\nafter trip he made down for more building material, and the afternoon\nhad passed when he finished the work to his satisfaction. Wildcats might\nscale the fence, but no coyote could come in to search for prey, and no\nrabbits or other small game could escape from the valley.\n\nUpon returning to camp he set about getting his supper at ease, around a\nfine fire, without hurry or fear of discovery. After hard work that\nhad definite purpose, this freedom and comfort gave him peculiar\nsatisfaction. He caught himself often, as he kept busy round the\ncamp-fire, stopping to glance at the quiet form in the cave, and at\nthe dogs stretched cozily near him, and then out across the beautiful\nvalley. The present was not yet real to him.\n\nWhile he ate, the sun set beyond a dip in the rim of the curved wall. As\nthe morning sun burst wondrously through a grand arch into this valley,\nin a golden, slanting shaft, so the evening sun, at the moment of\nsetting, shone through a gap of cliffs, sending down a broad red burst\nto brighten the oval with a blaze of fire. To Venters both sunrise and\nsunset were unreal.\n\nA cool wind blew across the oval, waving the tips of oaks, and while\nthe light lasted, fluttering the aspen leaves into millions of facets of\nred, and sweeping the graceful spruces. Then with the wind soon came\na shade and a darkening, and suddenly the valley was gray. Night came\nthere quickly after the sinking of the sun. Venters went softly to look\nat the girl. She slept, and her breathing was quiet and slow. He lifted\nRing into the cave, with stern whisper for him to stay there on\nguard. Then he drew the blanket carefully over her and returned to the\ncamp-fire.\n\nThough exceedingly tired, he was yet loath to yield to lassitude, but\nthis night it was not from listening, watchful vigilance; it was from\na desire to realize his position. The details of his wild environment\nseemed the only substance of a strange dream. He saw the darkening rims,\nthe gray oval turning black, the undulating surface of forest, like a\nrippling lake, and the spear-pointed spruces. He heard the flutter\nof aspen leaves and the soft, continuous splash of falling water. The\nmelancholy note of a canyon bird broke clear and lonely from the high\ncliffs. Venters had no name for this night singer, and he had never seen\none, but the few notes, always pealing out just at darkness, were as\nfamiliar to him as the canyon silence. Then they ceased, and the rustle\nof leaves and the murmur of water hushed in a growing sound that Venters\nfancied was not of earth. Neither had he a name for this, only it was\ninexpressibly wild and sweet. The thought came that it might be a moan\nof the girl in her last outcry of life, and he felt a tremor shake him.\nBut no! This sound was not human, though it was like despair. He began\nto doubt his sensitive perceptions, to believe that he half-dreamed what\nhe thought he heard. Then the sound swelled with the strengthening\nof the breeze, and he realized it was the singing of the wind in the\ncliffs.\n\nBy and by a drowsiness overcame him, and Venters began to nod, half\nasleep, with his back against a spruce. Rousing himself and calling\nWhitie, he went to the cave. The girl lay barely visible in the dimness.\nRing crouched beside her, and the patting of his tail on the stone\nassured Venters that the dog was awake and faithful to his duty. Venters\nsought his own bed of fragrant boughs; and as he lay back, somehow\ngrateful for the comfort and safety, the night seemed to steal away from\nhim and he sank softly into intangible space and rest and slumber.\n\nVenters awakened to the sound of melody that he imagined was only the\nhaunting echo of dream music. He opened his eyes to another surprise\nof this valley of beautiful surprises. Out of his cave he saw the\nexquisitely fine foliage of the silver spruces crossing a round space\nof blue morning sky; and in this lacy leafage fluttered a number of\ngray birds with black and white stripes and long tails. They were\nmocking-birds, and they were singing as if they wanted to burst their\nthroats. Venters listened. One long, silver-tipped branch dropped almost\nto his cave, and upon it, within a few yards of him, sat one of the\ngraceful birds. Venters saw the swelling and quivering of its throat\nin song. He arose, and when he slid down out of his cave the birds\nfluttered and flew farther away.\n\nVenters stepped before the opening of the other cave and looked in. The\ngirl was awake, with wide eyes and listening look, and she had a hand on\nRing's neck.\n\n\"Mocking-birds!\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Venters, \"and I believe they like our company.\"\n\n\"Where are we?\"\n\n\"Never mind now. After a little I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"The birds woke me. When I heard them--and saw the shiny trees--and the\nblue sky--and then a blaze of gold dropping down--I wondered--\"\n\nShe did not complete her fancy, but Venters imagined he understood her\nmeaning. She appeared to be wandering in mind. Venters felt her face and\nhands and found them burning with fever. He went for water, and was glad\nto find it almost as cold as if flowing from ice. That water was the\nonly medicine he had, and he put faith in it. She did not want to drink,\nbut he made her swallow, and then he bathed her face and head and cooled\nher wrists.\n\nThe day began with the heightening of the fever. Venters spent the time\nreducing her temperature, cooling her hot cheeks and temples. He kept\nclose watch over her, and at the least indication of restlessness, that\nhe knew led to tossing and rolling of the body, he held her tightly, so\nno violent move could reopen her wounds. Hour after hour she babbled and\nlaughed and cried and moaned in delirium; but whatever her secret was\nshe did not reveal it. Attended by something somber for Venters, the day\npassed. At night in the cool winds the fever abated and she slept.\n\nThe second day was a repetition of the first. On the third he seemed to\nsee her wither and waste away before his eyes. That day he scarcely went\nfrom her side for a moment, except to run for fresh, cool water; and he\ndid not eat. The fever broke on the fourth day and left her spent and\nshrunken, a slip of a girl with life only in her eyes. They hung upon\nVenters with a mute observance, and he found hope in that.\n\nTo rekindle the spark that had nearly flickered out, to nourish the\nlittle life and vitality that remained in her, was Venters's problem.\nBut he had little resource other than the meat of the rabbits and quail;\nand from these he made broths and soups as best he could, and fed her\nwith a spoon. It came to him that the human body, like the human soul,\nwas a strange thing and capable of recovering from terrible shocks. For\nalmost immediately she showed faint signs of gathering strength. There\nwas one more waiting day, in which he doubted, and spent long hours by\nher side as she slept, and watched the gentle swell of her breast rise\nand fall in breathing, and the wind stir the tangled chestnut curls. On\nthe next day he knew that she would live.\n\nUpon realizing it he abruptly left the cave and sought his accustomed\nseat against the trunk of a big spruce, where once more he let his\nglance stray along the sloping terraces. She would live, and the somber\ngloom lifted out of the valley, and he felt relief that was pain. Then\nhe roused to the call of action, to the many things he needed to do\nin the way of making camp fixtures and utensils, to the necessity of\nhunting food, and the desire to explore the valley.\n\nBut he decided to wait a few more days before going far from camp,\nbecause he fancied that the girl rested easier when she could see him\nnear at hand. And on the first day her languor appeared to leave her in\na renewed grip of life. She awoke stronger from each short slumber; she\nate greedily, and she moved about in her bed of boughs; and always, it\nseemed to Venters, her eyes followed him. He knew now that her recovery\nwould be rapid. She talked about the dogs, about the caves, the valley,\nabout how hungry she was, till Venters silenced her, asking her to put\noff further talk till another time. She obeyed, but she sat up in her\nbed, and her eyes roved to and fro, and always back to him.\n\nUpon the second morning she sat up when he awakened her, and would not\npermit him to bathe her face and feed her, which actions she performed\nfor herself. She spoke little, however, and Venters was quick to\ncatch in her the first intimations of thoughtfulness and curiosity and\nappreciation of her situation. He left camp and took Whitie out to\nhunt for rabbits. Upon his return he was amazed and somewhat anxiously\nconcerned to see his invalid sitting with her back to a corner of the\ncave and her bare feet swinging out. Hurriedly he approached, intending\nto advise her to lie down again, to tell her that perhaps she might\novertax her strength. The sun shone upon her, glinting on the little\nhead with its tangle of bright hair and the small, oval face with its\npallor, and dark-blue eyes underlined by dark-blue circles. She looked\nat him and he looked at her. In that exchange of glances he imagined\neach saw the other in some different guise. It seemed impossible to\nVenters that this frail girl could be Oldring's Masked Rider. It flashed\nover him that he had made a mistake which presently she would explain.\n\n\"Help me down,\" she said.\n\n\"But--are you well enough?\" he protested. \"Wait--a little longer.\"\n\n\"I'm weak--dizzy. But I want to get down.\"\n\nHe lifted her--what a light burden now!--and stood her upright beside\nhim, and supported her as she essayed to walk with halting steps. She\nwas like a stripling of a boy; the bright, small head scarcely reached\nhis shoulder. But now, as she clung to his arm, the rider's costume she\nwore did not contradict, as it had done at first, his feeling of her\nfemininity. She might be the famous Masked Rider of the uplands, she\nmight resemble a boy; but her outline, her little hands and feet, her\nhair, her big eyes and tremulous lips, and especially a something that\nVenters felt as a subtle essence rather than what he saw, proclaimed her\nsex.\n\nShe soon tired. He arranged a comfortable seat for her under the spruce\nthat overspread the camp-fire.\n\n\"Now tell me--everything,\" she said.\n\nHe recounted all that had happened from the time of his discovery of the\nrustlers in the canyon up to the present moment.\n\n\"You shot me--and now you've saved my life?\"\n\n\"Yes. After almost killing you I've pulled you through.\"\n\n\"Are you glad?\"\n\n\"I should say so!\"\n\nHer eyes were unusually expressive, and they regarded him steadily; she\nwas unconscious of that mirroring of her emotions and they shone with\ngratefulness and interest and wonder and sadness.\n\n\"Tell me--about yourself?\" she asked.\n\nHe made this a briefer story, telling of his coming to Utah, his\nvarious occupations till he became a rider, and then how the Mormons had\npractically driven him out of Cottonwoods, an outcast.\n\nThen, no longer able to withstand his own burning curiosity, he\nquestioned her in turn.\n\n\"Are you Oldring's Masked Rider?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, and dropped her eyes.\n\n\"I knew it--I recognized your figure--and mask, for I saw you once.\nYet I can't believe it!... But you never were really that rustler, as we\nriders knew him? A thief--a marauder--a kidnapper of women--a murderer\nof sleeping riders!\"\n\n\"No! I never stole--or harmed any one--in all my life. I only rode and\nrode--\"\n\n\"But why--why?\" he burst out. \"Why the name? I understand Oldring made\nyou ride. But the black mask--the mystery--the things laid to your\nhands--the threats in your infamous name--the night-riding credited\nto you--the evil deeds deliberately blamed on you and acknowledged by\nrustlers--even Oldring himself! Why? Tell me why?\"\n\n\"I never knew that,\" she answered low. Her drooping head straightened,\nand the large eyes, larger now and darker, met Venters's with a clear,\nsteadfast gaze in which he read truth. It verified his own conviction.\n\n\"Never knew? That's strange! Are you a Mormon?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is Oldring a Mormon?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you--care for him?\"\n\n\"Yes. I hate his men--his life--sometimes I almost hate him!\"\n\nVenters paused in his rapid-fire questioning, as if to brace him self to\nask for a truth that would be abhorrent for him to confirm, but which he\nseemed driven to hear.\n\n\"What are--what were you to Oldring?\"\n\nLike some delicate thing suddenly exposed to blasting heat, the girl\nwilted; her head dropped, and into her white, wasted cheeks crept the\nred of shame.\n\nVenters would have given anything to recall that question. It seemed\nso different--his thought when spoken. Yet her shame established in his\nmind something akin to the respect he had strangely been hungering to\nfeel for her.\n\n\"D--n that question!--forget it!\" he cried, in a passion of pain for her\nand anger at himself. \"But once and for all--tell me--I know it, yet I\nwant to hear you say so--you couldn't help yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"Well, that makes it all right with me,\" he went on, honestly. \"I--I\nwant you to feel that... you see--we've been thrown together--and--and I\nwant to help you--not hurt you. I thought life had been cruel to me, but\nwhen I think of yours I feel mean and little for my complaining. Anyway,\nI was a lonely outcast. And now!... I don't see very clearly what it all\nmeans. Only we are here--together. We've got to stay here, for long,\nsurely till you are well. But you'll never go back to Oldring. And I'm\nsure helping you will help me, for I was sick in mind. There's something\nnow for me to do. And if I can win back your strength--then get you\naway, out of this wild country--help you somehow to a happier life--just\nthink how good that'll be for me!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. LOVE\n\nDuring all these waiting days Venters, with the exception of the\nafternoon when he had built the gate in the gorge, had scarcely gone\nout of sight of camp and never out of hearing. His desire to explore\nSurprise Valley was keen, and on the morning after his long talk with\nthe girl he took his rifle and, calling Ring, made a move to start. The\ngirl lay back in a rude chair of boughs he had put together for her. She\nhad been watching him, and when he picked up the gun and called the dog\nVenters thought she gave a nervous start.\n\n\"I'm only going to look over the valley,\" he said.\n\n\"Will you be gone long?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied, and started off. The incident set him thinking of his\nformer impression that, after her recovery from fever, she did not seem\nat ease unless he was close at hand. It was fear of being alone, due, he\nconcluded, most likely to her weakened condition. He must not leave her\nmuch alone.\n\nAs he strode down the sloping terrace, rabbits scampered before him,\nand the beautiful valley quail, as purple in color as the sage on the\nuplands, ran fleetly along the ground into the forest. It was pleasant\nunder the trees, in the gold-flecked shade, with the whistle of quail\nand twittering of birds everywhere. Soon he had passed the limit of his\nformer excursions and entered new territory. Here the woods began to\nshow open glades and brooks running down from the slope, and presently\nhe emerged from shade into the sunshine of a meadow. The shaking of the\nhigh grass told him of the running of animals, what species he could\nnot tell, but from Ring's manifest desire to have a chase they were\nevidently some kind wilder than rabbits. Venters approached the willow\nand cottonwood belt that he had observed from the height of slope.\nHe penetrated it to find a considerable stream of water and great\nhalf-submerged mounds of brush and sticks, and all about him were old\nand new gnawed circles at the base of the cottonwoods.\n\n\"Beaver!\" he exclaimed. \"By all that's lucky! The meadow's full of\nbeaver! How did they ever get here?\"\n\nBeaver had not found a way into the valley by the trail of the\ncliff-dwellers, of that he was certain; and he began to have more than\ncuriosity as to the outlet or inlet of the stream. When he passed some\ndead water, which he noted was held by a beaver dam, there was a current\nin the stream, and it flowed west. Following its course, he soon entered\nthe oak forest again, and passed through to find himself before massed\nand jumbled ruins of cliff wall. There were tangled thickets of\nwild plum-trees and other thorny growths that made passage extremely\nlaborsome. He found innumerable tracks of wildcats and foxes. Rustlings\nin the thick undergrowth told him of stealthy movements of these\nanimals. At length his further advance appeared futile, for the reason\nthat the stream disappeared in a split at the base of immense rocks over\nwhich he could not climb. To his relief he concluded that though beaver\nmight work their way up the narrow chasm where the water rushed, it\nwould be impossible for men to enter the valley there.\n\nThis western curve was the only part of the valley where the walls had\nbeen split asunder, and it was a wildly rough and inaccessible corner.\nGoing back a little way, he leaped the stream and headed toward the\nsouthern wall. Once out of the oaks he found again the low terrace of\naspens, and above that the wide, open terrace fringed by silver spruces.\nThis side of the valley contained the wind or water worn caves. As he\npressed on, keeping to the upper terrace, cave after cave opened out of\nthe cliff; now a large one, now a small one. Then yawned, quite suddenly\nand wonderfully above him, the great cavern of the cliff-dwellers.\n\nIt was still a goodly distance, and he tried to imagine, if it appeared\nso huge from where he stood, what it would be when he got there. He\nclimbed the terrace and then faced a long, gradual ascent of weathered\nrock and dust, which made climbing too difficult for attention to\nanything else. At length he entered a zone of shade, and looked up.\nHe stood just within the hollow of a cavern so immense that he had no\nconception of its real dimensions. The curved roof, stained by ages\nof leakage, with buff and black and rust-colored streaks, swept up and\nloomed higher and seemed to soar to the rim of the cliff. Here again was\na magnificent arch, such as formed the grand gateway to the valley, only\nin this instance it formed the dome of a cave instead of the span of a\nbridge.\n\nVenters passed onward and upward. The stones he dislodged rolled down\nwith strange, hollow crack and roar. He had climbed a hundred rods\ninward, and yet he had not reached the base of the shelf where the\ncliff-dwellings rested, a long half-circle of connected stone house,\nwith little dark holes that he had fancied were eyes. At length he\ngained the base of the shelf, and here found steps cut in the rock.\nThese facilitated climbing, and as he went up he thought how easily this\nvanished race of men might once have held that stronghold against an\narmy. There was only one possible place to ascend, and this was narrow\nand steep.\n\nVenters had visited cliff-dwellings before, and they had been in ruins,\nand of no great character or size but this place was of proportions that\nstunned him, and it had not been desecrated by the hand of man, nor had\nit been crumbled by the hand of time. It was a stupendous tomb. It had\nbeen a city. It was just as it had been left by its builders. The little\nhouses were there, the smoke-blackened stains of fires, the pieces of\npottery scattered about cold hearths, the stone hatchets; and stone\npestles and mealing-stones lay beside round holes polished by years\nof grinding maize--lay there as if they had been carelessly dropped\nyesterday. But the cliff-dwellers were gone!\n\nDust! They were dust on the floor or at the foot of the shelf, and their\nhabitations and utensils endured. Venters felt the sublimity of that\nmarvelous vaulted arch, and it seemed to gleam with a glory of something\nthat was gone. How many years had passed since the cliff-dwellers gazed\nout across the beautiful valley as he was gazing now? How long had it\nbeen since women ground grain in those polished holes? What time had\nrolled by since men of an unknown race lived, loved, fought, and died\nthere? Had an enemy destroyed them? Had disease destroyed them, or only\nthat greatest destroyer--time? Venters saw a long line of blood-red\nhands painted low down upon the yellow roof of stone. Here was strange\nportent, if not an answer to his queries. The place oppressed him. It\nwas light, but full of a transparent gloom. It smelled of dust and musty\nstone, of age and disuse. It was sad. It was solemn. It had the look\nof a place where silence had become master and was now irrevocable and\nterrible and could not be broken. Yet, at the moment, from high up in\nthe carved crevices of the arch, floated down the low, strange wail of\nwind--a knell indeed for all that had gone.\n\nVenters, sighing, gathered up an armful of pottery, such pieces as he\nthought strong enough and suitable for his own use, and bent his steps\ntoward camp. He mounted the terrace at an opposite point to which he\nhad left. He saw the girl looking in the direction he had gone. His\nfootsteps made no sound in the deep grass, and he approached close\nwithout her being aware of his presence. Whitie lay on the ground near\nwhere she sat, and he manifested the usual actions of welcome, but the\ngirl did not notice them. She seemed to be oblivious to everything near\nat hand. She made a pathetic figure drooping there, with her sunny hair\ncontrasting so markedly with her white, wasted cheeks and her hands\nlistlessly clasped and her little bare feet propped in the framework of\nthe rude seat. Venters could have sworn and laughed in one breath at the\nidea of the connection between this girl and Oldring's Masked Rider. She\nwas the victim of more than accident of fate--a victim to some deep\nplot the mystery of which burned him. As he stepped forward with a\nhalf-formed thought that she was absorbed in watching for his return,\nshe turned her head and saw him. A swift start, a change rather than\nrush of blood under her white cheeks, a flashing of big eyes that fixed\ntheir glance upon him, transformed her face in that single instant of\nturning, and he knew she had been watching for him, that his return was\nthe one thing in her mind. She did not smile; she did not flush; she\ndid not look glad. All these would have meant little compared to her\nindefinite expression. Venters grasped the peculiar, vivid, vital\nsomething that leaped from her face. It was as if she had been in a\ndead, hopeless clamp of inaction and feeling, and had been suddenly shot\nthrough and through with quivering animation. Almost it was as if she\nhad returned to life.\n\nAnd Venters thought with lightning swiftness, \"I've saved her--I've\nunlinked her from that old life--she was watching as if I were all she\nhad left on earth--she belongs to me!\" The thought was startlingly new.\nLike a blow it was in an unprepared moment. The cheery salutation he had\nready for her died unborn and he tumbled the pieces of pottery awkwardly\non the grass while some unfamiliar, deep-seated emotion, mixed with pity\nand glad assurance of his power to succor her, held him dumb.\n\n\"What a load you had!\" she said. \"Why, they're pots and crocks! Where\ndid you get them?\"\n\nVenters laid down his rifle, and, filling one of the pots from his\ncanteen, he placed it on the smoldering campfire.\n\n\"Hope it'll hold water,\" he said, presently. \"Why, there's an enormous\ncliff-dwelling just across here. I got the pottery there. Don't you\nthink we needed something? That tin cup of mine has served to make tea,\nbroth, soup--everything.\"\n\n\"I noticed we hadn't a great deal to cook in.\"\n\nShe laughed. It was the first time. He liked that laugh, and though he\nwas tempted to look at her, he did not want to show his surprise or his\npleasure.\n\n\"Will you take me over there, and all around in the valley--pretty soon,\nwhen I'm well?\" she added.\n\n\"Indeed I shall. It's a wonderful place. Rabbits so thick you can't step\nwithout kicking one out. And quail, beaver, foxes, wildcats. We're in a\nregular den. But--haven't you ever seen a cliff-dwelling?\"\n\n\"No. I've heard about them, though. The--the men say the Pass is full of\nold houses and ruins.\"\n\n\"Why, I should think you'd have run across one in all your riding\naround,\" said Venters. He spoke slowly, choosing his words carefully,\nand he essayed a perfectly casual manner, and pretended to be busy\nassorting pieces of pottery. She must have no cause again to suffer\nshame for curiosity of his. Yet never in all his days had he been so\neager to hear the details of anyone's life.\n\n\"When I rode--I rode like the wind,\" she replied, \"and never had time to\nstop for anything.\"\n\n\"I remember that day I--I met you in the Pass--how dusty you were, how\ntired your horse looked. Were you always riding?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Sometimes not for months, when I was shut up in the cabin.\"\n\nVenters tried to subdue a hot tingling.\n\n\"You were shut up, then?\" he asked, carelessly.\n\n\"When Oldring went away on his long trips--he was gone for months\nsometimes--he shut me up in the cabin.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Perhaps to keep me from running away. I always threatened that. Mostly,\nthough, because the men got drunk at the villages. But they were always\ngood to me. I wasn't afraid.\"\n\n\"A prisoner! That must have been hard on you?\"\n\n\"I liked that. As long as I can remember I've been locked up there at\ntimes, and those times were the only happy ones I ever had. It's a big\ncabin, high up on a cliff, and I could look out. Then I had dogs and\npets I had tamed, and books. There was a spring inside, and food stored,\nand the men brought me fresh meat. Once I was there one whole winter.\"\n\nIt now required deliberation on Venters's part to persist in his\nunconcern and to keep at work. He wanted to look at her, to volley\nquestions at her.\n\n\"As long as you can remember--you've lived in Deception Pass?\" he went\non.\n\n\"I've a dim memory of some other place, and women and children; but I\ncan't make anything of it. Sometimes I think till I'm weary.\"\n\n\"Then you can read--you have books?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I can read, and write, too, pretty well. Oldring is educated.\nHe taught me, and years ago an old rustler lived with us, and he had\nbeen something different once. He was always teaching me.\"\n\n\"So Oldring takes long trips,\" mused Venters. \"Do you know where he\ngoes?\"\n\n\"No. Every year he drives cattle north of Sterling--then does not return\nfor months. I heard him accused once of living two lives--and he killed\nthe man. That was at Stone Bridge.\"\n\nVenters dropped his apparent task and looked up with an eagerness he no\nlonger strove to hide.\n\n\"Bess,\" he said, using her name for the first time, \"I suspected Oldring\nwas something besides a rustler. Tell me, what's his purpose here in the\nPass? I believe much that he has done was to hide his real work here.\"\n\n\"You're right. He's more than a rustler. In fact, as the men say, his\nrustling cattle is now only a bluff. There's gold in the canyons!\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Yes, there's gold, not in great quantities, but gold enough for him and\nhis men. They wash for gold week in and week out. Then they drive a few\ncattle and go into the villages to drink and shoot and kill--to bluff\nthe riders.\"\n\n\"Drive a few cattle! But, Bess, the Withersteen herd, the red\nherd--twenty-five hundred head! That's not a few. And I tracked them\ninto a valley near here.\"\n\n\"Oldring never stole the red herd. He made a deal with Mormons. The\nriders were to be called in, and Oldring was to drive the herd and keep\nit till a certain time--I won't know when--then drive it back to the\nrange. What his share was I didn't hear.\"\n\n\"Did you hear why that deal was made?\" queried Venters.\n\n\"No. But it was a trick of Mormons. They're full of tricks. I've heard\nOldring's men tell about Mormons. Maybe the Withersteen woman wasn't\nminding her halter! I saw the man who made the deal. He was a little,\nqueer-shaped man, all humped up. He sat his horse well. I heard one of\nour men say afterward there was no better rider on the sage than this\nfellow. What was the name? I forget.\"\n\n\"Jerry Card?\" suggested Venters.\n\n\"That's it. I remember--it's a name easy to remember--and Jerry Card\nappeared to be on fair terms with Oldring's men.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder,\" replied Venters, thoughtfully. Verification of his\nsuspicions in regard to Tull's underhand work--for the deal with Oldring\nmade by Jerry Card assuredly had its inception in the Mormon Elder's\nbrain, and had been accomplished through his orders--revived in Venters\na memory of hatred that had been smothered by press of other emotions.\nOnly a few days had elapsed since the hour of his encounter with Tull,\nyet they had been forgotten and now seemed far off, and the interval\none that now appeared large and profound with incalculable change in his\nfeelings. Hatred of Tull still existed in his heart, but it had lost its\nwhite heat. His affection for Jane Withersteen had not changed in the\nleast; nevertheless, he seemed to view it from another angle and see it\nas another thing--what, he could not exactly define. The recalling of\nthese two feelings was to Venters like getting glimpses into a self\nthat was gone; and the wonder of them--perhaps the change which was too\nillusive for him--was the fact that a strange irritation accompanied\nthe memory and a desire to dismiss it from mind. And straightway he did\ndismiss it, to return to thoughts of his significant present.\n\n\"Bess, tell me one more thing,\" he said. \"Haven't you known any\nwomen--any young people?\"\n\n\"Sometimes there were women with the men; but Oldring never let me know\nthem. And all the young people I ever saw in my life was when I rode\nfast through the villages.\"\n\nPerhaps that was the most puzzling and thought-provoking thing she had\nyet said to Venters. He pondered, more curious the more he learned, but\nhe curbed his inquisitive desires, for he saw her shrinking on the\nverge of that shame, the causing of which had occasioned him such\nself-reproach. He would ask no more. Still he had to think, and he\nfound it difficult to think clearly. This sad-eyed girl was so utterly\ndifferent from what it would have been reason to believe such a\nremarkable life would have made her. On this day he had found her simple\nand frank, as natural as any girl he had ever known. About her there was\nsomething sweet. Her voice was low and well modulated. He could not look\ninto her face, meet her steady, unabashed, yet wistful eyes, and think\nof her as the woman she had confessed herself. Oldring's Masked Rider\nsat before him, a girl dressed as a man. She had been made to ride at\nthe head of infamous forays and drives. She had been imprisoned for many\nmonths of her life in an obscure cabin. At times the most vicious of men\nhad been her companions; and the vilest of women, if they had not been\npermitted to approach her, had, at least, cast their shadows over her.\nBut--but in spite of all this--there thundered at Venters some truth\nthat lifted its voice higher than the clamoring facts of dishonor,\nsome truth that was the very life of her beautiful eyes; and it was\ninnocence.\n\nIn the days that followed, Venters balanced perpetually in mind this\nhaunting conception of innocence over against the cold and sickening\nfact of an unintentional yet actual gift. How could it be possible for\nthe two things to be true? He believed the latter to be true, and he\nwould not relinquish his conviction of the former; and these conflicting\nthoughts augmented the mystery that appeared to be a part of Bess. In\nthose ensuing days, however, it became clear as clearest light that\nBess was rapidly regaining strength; that, unless reminded of her long\nassociation with Oldring, she seemed to have forgotten it; that, like an\nIndian who lives solely from moment to moment, she was utterly absorbed\nin the present.\n\nDay by day Venters watched the white of her face slowly change to brown,\nand the wasted cheeks fill out by imperceptible degrees. There came a\ntime when he could just trace the line of demarcation between the part\nof her face once hidden by a mask and that left exposed to wind and sun.\nWhen that line disappeared in clear bronze tan it was as if she had been\nwashed clean of the stigma of Oldring's Masked Rider. The suggestion of\nthe mask always made Venters remember; now that it was gone he seldom\nthought of her past. Occasionally he tried to piece together the several\nstages of strange experience and to make a whole. He had shot a masked\noutlaw the very sight of whom had been ill omen to riders; he had\ncarried off a wounded woman whose bloody lips quivered in prayer; he\nhad nursed what seemed a frail, shrunken boy; and now he watched a girl\nwhose face had become strangely sweet, whose dark-blue eyes were ever\nupon him without boldness, without shyness, but with a steady, grave,\nand growing light. Many times Venters found the clear gaze embarrassing\nto him, yet, like wine, it had an exhilarating effect. What did she\nthink when she looked at him so? Almost he believed she had no thought\nat all. All about her and the present there in Surprise Valley, and\nthe dim yet subtly impending future, fascinated Venters and made him\nthoughtful as all his lonely vigils in the sage had not.\n\nChiefly it was the present that he wished to dwell upon; but it was the\ncall of the future which stirred him to action. No idea had he of\nwhat that future had in store for Bess and him. He began to think\nof improving Surprise Valley as a place to live in, for there was\nno telling how long they would be compelled to stay there. Venters\nstubbornly resisted the entering into his mind of an insistent thought\nthat, clearly realized, might have made it plain to him that he did\nnot want to leave Surprise Valley at all. But it was imperative that he\nconsider practical matters; and whether or not he was destined to stay\nlong there, he felt the immediate need of a change of diet. It would be\nnecessary for him to go farther afield for a variety of meat, and also\nthat he soon visit Cottonwoods for a supply of food.\n\nIt occurred again to Venters that he could go to the canyon where\nOldring kept his cattle, and at little risk he could pack out some beef.\nHe wished to do this, however, without letting Bess know of it till\nafter he had made the trip. Presently he hit upon the plan of going\nwhile she was asleep.\n\nThat very night he stole out of camp, climbed up under the stone bridge,\nand entered the outlet to the Pass. The gorge was full of luminous\ngloom. Balancing Rock loomed dark and leaned over the pale descent.\nTransformed in the shadowy light, it took shape and dimensions of a\nspectral god waiting--waiting for the moment to hurl himself down upon\nthe tottering walls and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass. At\nnight more than by day Venters felt something fearful and fateful in\nthat rock, and that it had leaned and waited through a thousand years to\nhave somehow to deal with his destiny.\n\n\"Old man, if you must roll, wait till I get back to the girl, and then\nroll!\" he said, aloud, as if the stones were indeed a god.\n\nAnd those spoken words, in their grim note to his ear, as well as\ncontents to his mind, told Venters that he was all but drifting on a\ncurrent which he had not power nor wish to stem.\n\nVenters exercised his usual care in the matter of hiding tracks from the\noutlet, yet it took him scarcely an hour to reach Oldring's cattle.\nHere sight of many calves changed his original intention, and instead\nof packing out meat he decided to take a calf out alive. He roped one,\nsecurely tied its feet, and swung it over his shoulder. Here was an\nexceedingly heavy burden, but Venters was powerful--he could take up\na sack of grain and with ease pitch it over a pack-saddle--and he made\nlong distance without resting. The hardest work came in the climb up to\nthe outlet and on through to the valley. When he had accomplished it,\nhe became fired with another idea that again changed his intention.\nHe would not kill the calf, but keep it alive. He would go back to\nOldring's herd and pack out more calves. Thereupon he secured the calf\nin the best available spot for the moment and turned to make a second\ntrip.\n\nWhen Venters got back to the valley with another calf, it was close upon\ndaybreak. He crawled into his cave and slept late. Bess had no inkling\nthat he had been absent from camp nearly all night, and only remarked\nsolicitously that he appeared to be more tired than usual, and more in\nthe need of sleep. In the afternoon Venters built a gate across a small\nravine near camp, and here corralled the calves; and he succeeded in\ncompleting his task without Bess being any the wiser.\n\nThat night he made two more trips to Oldring's range, and again on the\nfollowing night, and yet another on the next. With eight calves in his\ncorral, he concluded that he had enough; but it dawned upon him then\nthat he did not want to kill one. \"I've rustled Oldring's cattle,\" he\nsaid, and laughed. He noted then that all the calves were red. \"Red!\"\nhe exclaimed. \"From the red herd. I've stolen Jane Withersteen's\ncattle!... That's about the strangest thing yet.\"\n\nOne more trip he undertook to Oldring's valley, and this time he roped\na yearling steer and killed it and cut out a small quarter of beef. The\nhowling of coyotes told him he need have no apprehension that the work\nof his knife would be discovered. He packed the beef back to camp and\nhung it upon a spruce-tree. Then he sought his bed.\n\nOn the morrow he was up bright and early, glad that he had a surprise\nfor Bess. He could hardly wait for her to come out. Presently she\nappeared and walked under the spruce. Then she approached the camp-fire.\nThere was a tinge of healthy red in the bronze of her cheeks, and her\nslender form had begun to round out in graceful lines.\n\n\"Bess, didn't you say you were tired of rabbit?\" inquired Venters. \"And\nquail and beaver?\"\n\n\"Indeed I did.\"\n\n\"What would you like?\"\n\n\"I'm tired of meat, but if we have to live on it I'd like some beef.\"\n\n\"Well, how does that strike you?\" Venters pointed to the quarter hanging\nfrom the spruce-tree. \"We'll have fresh beef for a few days, then we'll\ncut the rest into strips and dry it.\"\n\n\"Where did you get that?\" asked Bess, slowly.\n\n\"I stole that from Oldring.\"\n\n\"You went back to the canyon--you risked--\" While she hesitated the\ntinge of bloom faded out of her cheeks.\n\n\"It wasn't any risk, but it was hard work.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I said I was tired of rabbit. Why! How--When did you get that\nbeef?\"\n\n\"Last night.\"\n\n\"While I was asleep?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I woke last night sometime--but I didn't know.\"\n\nHer eyes were widening, darkening with thought, and whenever they did\nso the steady, watchful, seeing gaze gave place to the wistful light. In\nthe former she saw as the primitive woman without thought; in the latter\nshe looked inward, and her gaze was the reflection of a troubled mind.\nFor long Venters had not seen that dark change, that deepening of blue,\nwhich he thought was beautiful and sad. But now he wanted to make her\nthink.\n\n\"I've done more than pack in that beef,\" he said. \"For five nights I've\nbeen working while you slept. I've got eight calves corralled near a\nravine. Eight calves, all alive and doing fine!\"\n\n\"You went five nights!\"\n\nAll that Venters could make of the dilation of her eyes, her slow\npallor, and her exclamation, was fear--fear for herself or for him.\n\n\"Yes. I didn't tell you, because I knew you were afraid to be left\nalone.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" She echoed his word, but the meaning of it was nothing to her.\nShe had not even thought of being left alone. It was not, then, fear for\nherself, but for him. This girl, always slow of speech and action, now\nseemed almost stupid. She put forth a hand that might have indicated the\ngroping of her mind. Suddenly she stepped swiftly to him, with a look\nand touch that drove from him any doubt of her quick intelligence or\nfeeling.\n\n\"Oldring has men watch the herds--they would kill you. You must never go\nagain!\"\n\nWhen she had spoken, the strength and the blaze of her died, and she\nswayed toward Venters.\n\n\"Bess, I'll not go again,\" he said, catching her.\n\nShe leaned against him, and her body was limp and vibrated to a long,\nwavering tremble. Her face was upturned to his. Woman's face, woman's\neyes, woman's lips--all acutely and blindly and sweetly and terribly\ntruthful in their betrayal! But as her fear was instinctive, so was her\nclinging to this one and only friend.\n\nVenters gently put her from him and steadied her upon her feet; and all\nthe while his blood raced wild, and a thrilling tingle unsteadied his\nnerve, and something--that he had seen and felt in her--that he could\nnot understand--seemed very close to him, warm and rich as a fragrant\nbreath, sweet as nothing had ever before been sweet to him.\n\nWith all his will Venters strove for calmness and thought and judgment\nunbiased by pity, and reality unswayed by sentiment. Bess's eyes were\nstill fixed upon him with all her soul bright in that wistful light.\nSwiftly, resolutely he put out of mind all of her life except what had\nbeen spent with him. He scorned himself for the intelligence that made\nhim still doubt. He meant to judge her as she had judged him. He was\nface to face with the inevitableness of life itself. He saw destiny in\nthe dark, straight path of her wonderful eyes. Here was the simplicity,\nthe sweetness of a girl contending with new and strange and enthralling\nemotions here the living truth of innocence; here the blind terror of a\nwoman confronted with the thought of death to her savior and protector.\nAll this Venters saw, but, besides, there was in Bess's eyes a\nslow-dawning consciousness that seemed about to break out in glorious\nradiance.\n\n\"Bess, are you thinking?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes--oh yes!\"\n\n\"Do you realize we are here alone--man and woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you thought that we may make our way out to civilization, or we\nmay have to stay here--alone--hidden from the world all our lives?\"\n\n\"I never thought--till now.\"\n\n\"Well, what's your choice--to go--or to stay here--alone with me?\"\n\n\"Stay!\" New-born thought of self, ringing vibrantly in her voice, gave\nher answer singular power.\n\nVenters trembled, and then swiftly turned his gaze from her face--from\nher eyes. He knew what she had only half divined--that she loved him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. FAITH AND UNFAITH\n\nAt Jane Withersteen's home the promise made to Mrs. Larkin to care for\nlittle Fay had begun to be fulfilled. Like a gleam of sunlight through\nthe cottonwoods was the coming of the child to the gloomy house of\nWithersteen. The big, silent halls echoed with childish laughter. In the\nshady court, where Jane spent many of the hot July days, Fay's tiny\nfeet pattered over the stone flags and splashed in the amber stream. She\nprattled incessantly. What difference, Jane thought, a child made in her\nhome! It had never been a real home, she discovered. Even the tidiness\nand neatness she had so observed, and upon which she had insisted to her\nwomen, became, in the light of Fay's smile, habits that now lost their\nimportance. Fay littered the court with Jane's books and papers, and\nother toys her fancy improvised, and many a strange craft went floating\ndown the little brook.\n\nAnd it was owing to Fay's presence that Jane Withersteen came to see\nmore of Lassiter. The rider had for the most part kept to the sage. He\nrode for her, but he did not seek her except on business; and Jane had\nto acknowledge in pique that her overtures had been made in vain. Fay,\nhowever, captured Lassiter the moment he first laid eyes on her.\n\nJane was present at the meeting, and there was something about it which\ndimmed her sight and softened her toward this foe of her people. The\nrider had clanked into the court, a tired yet wary man, always looking\nfor the attack upon him that was inevitable and might come from any\nquarter; and he had walked right upon little Fay. The child had been\nbeautiful even in her rags and amid the surroundings of the hovel in the\nsage, but now, in a pretty white dress, with her shining curls brushed\nand her face clean and rosy, she was lovely. She left her play and\nlooked up at Lassiter.\n\nIf there was not an instinct for all three of them in that meeting, an\nunreasoning tendency toward a closer intimacy, then Jane Withersteen\nbelieved she had been subject to a queer fancy. She imagined any child\nwould have feared Lassiter. And Fay Larkin had been a lonely, a solitary\nelf of the sage, not at all an ordinary child, and exquisitely shy\nwith strangers. She watched Lassiter with great, round, grave eyes, but\nshowed no fear. The rider gave Jane a favorable report of cattle and\nhorses; and as he took the seat to which she invited him, little Fay\nedged as much as half an inch nearer. Jane replied to his look of\ninquiry and told Fay's story. The rider's gray, earnest gaze troubled\nher. Then he turned to Fay and smiled in a way that made Jane doubt her\nsense of the true relation of things. How could Lassiter smile so at a\nchild when he had made so many children fatherless? But he did smile,\nand to the gentleness she had seen a few times he added something that\nwas infinitely sad and sweet. Jane's intuition told her that Lassiter\nhad never been a father, but if life ever so blessed him he would be a\ngood one. Fay, also, must have found that smile singularly winning. For\nshe edged closer and closer, and then, by way of feminine capitulation,\nwent to Jane, from whose side she bent a beautiful glance upon the\nrider.\n\nLassiter only smiled at her.\n\nJane watched them, and realized that now was the moment she should\nseize, if she was ever to win this man from his hatred. But the step was\nnot easy to take. The more she saw of Lassiter the more she respected\nhim, and the greater her respect the harder it became to lend herself to\nmere coquetry. Yet as she thought of her great motive, of Tull, and\nof that other whose name she had schooled herself never to think of\nin connection with Milly Erne's avenger, she suddenly found she had no\nchoice. And her creed gave her boldness far beyond the limit to which\nvanity would have led her.\n\n\"Lassiter, I see so little of you now,\" she said, and was conscious of\nheat in her cheeks.\n\n\"I've been riding hard,\" he replied.\n\n\"But you can't live in the saddle. You come in sometimes. Won't you come\nhere to see me--oftener?\"\n\n\"Is that an order?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! I simply ask you to come to see me when you find time.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nThe query once heard was not so embarrassing to Jane as she might have\nimagined. Moreover, it established in her mind a fact that there existed\nactually other than selfish reasons for her wanting to see him. And as\nshe had been bold, so she determined to be both honest and brave.\n\n\"I've reasons--only one of which I need mention,\" she answered. \"If it's\npossible I want to change you toward my people. And on the moment I can\nconceive of little I wouldn't do to gain that end.\"\n\nHow much better and freer Jane felt after that confession! She meant to\nshow him that there was one Mormon who could play a game or wage a fight\nin the open.\n\n\"I reckon,\" said Lassiter, and he laughed.\n\nIt was the best in her, if the most irritating, that Lassiter always\naroused.\n\n\"Will you come?\" She looked into his eyes, and for the life of her could\nnot quite subdue an imperiousness that rose with her spirit. \"I never\nasked so much of any man--except Bern Venters.\"\n\n\"'Pears to me that you'd run no risk, or Venters, either. But mebbe that\ndoesn't hold good for me.\"\n\n\"You mean it wouldn't be safe for you to be often here? You look for\nambush in the cottonwoods?\"\n\n\"Not that so much.\"\n\nAt this juncture little Fay sidled over to Lassiter.\n\n\"Has oo a little dirl?\" she inquired.\n\n\"No, lassie,\" replied the rider.\n\nWhatever Fay seemed to be searching for in Lassiter's sun-reddened face\nand quiet eyes she evidently found. \"Oo tan tom to see me,\" she added,\nand with that, shyness gave place to friendly curiosity. First his\nsombrero with its leather band and silver ornaments commanded her\nattention; next his quirt, and then the clinking, silver spurs. These\nheld her for some time, but presently, true to childish fickleness, she\nleft off playing with them to look for something else. She laughed in\nglee as she ran her little hands down the slippery, shiny surface\nof Lassiter's leather chaps. Soon she discovered one of the hanging\ngun--sheaths, and she dragged it up and began tugging at the huge black\nhandle of the gun. Jane Withersteen repressed an exclamation. What\nsignificance there was to her in the little girl's efforts to dislodge\nthat heavy weapon! Jane Withersteen saw Fay's play and her beauty and\nher love as most powerful allies to her own woman's part in a game that\nsuddenly had acquired a strange zest and a hint of danger. And as for\nthe rider, he appeared to have forgotten Jane in the wonder of this\nlovely child playing about him. At first he was much the shyer of the\ntwo. Gradually her confidence overcame his backwardness, and he had the\ntemerity to stroke her golden curls with a great hand. Fay rewarded his\nboldness with a smile, and when he had gone to the extreme of closing\nthat great hand over her little brown one, she said, simply, \"I like\noo!\"\n\nSight of his face then made Jane oblivious for the time to his character\nas a hater of Mormons. Out of the mother longing that swelled her breast\nshe divined the child hunger in Lassiter.\n\nHe returned the next day, and the next; and upon the following he came\nboth at morning and at night. Upon the evening of this fourth day Jane\nseemed to feel the breaking of a brooding struggle in Lassiter. During\nall these visits he had scarcely a word to say, though he watched her\nand played absent-mindedly with Fay. Jane had contented herself with\nsilence. Soon little Fay substituted for the expression of regard, \"I\nlike oo,\" a warmer and more generous one, \"I love oo.\"\n\nThereafter Lassiter came oftener to see Jane and her little protegee.\nDaily he grew more gentle and kind, and gradually developed a quaintly\nmerry mood. In the morning he lifted Fay upon his horse and let her\nride as he walked beside her to the edge of the sage. In the evening he\nplayed with the child at an infinite variety of games she invented,\nand then, oftener than not, he accepted Jane's invitation to supper. No\nother visitor came to Withersteen House during those days. So that in\nspite of watchfulness he never forgot, Lassiter began to show he felt at\nhome there. After the meal they walked into the grove of cottonwoods or\nup by the lakes, and little Fay held Lassiter's hand as much as she held\nJane's. Thus a strange relationship was established, and Jane liked it.\nAt twilight they always returned to the house, where Fay kissed them and\nwent in to her mother. Lassiter and Jane were left alone.\n\nThen, if there were anything that a good woman could do to win a man\nand still preserve her self-respect, it was something which escaped the\nnatural subtlety of a woman determined to allure. Jane's vanity, that\nafter all was not great, was soon satisfied with Lassiter's silent\nadmiration. And her honest desire to lead him from his dark,\nblood-stained path would never have blinded her to what she owed\nherself. But the driving passion of her religion, and its call to save\nMormons' lives, one life in particular, bore Jane Withersteen close to\nan infringement of her womanhood. In the beginning she had reasoned that\nher appeal to Lassiter must be through the senses. With whatever means\nshe possessed in the way of adornment she enhanced her beauty. And she\nstooped to artifices that she knew were unworthy of her, but which\nshe deliberately chose to employ. She made of herself a girl in every\nvariable mood wherein a girl might be desirable. In those moods she was\nnot above the methods of an inexperienced though natural flirt. She\nkept close to him whenever opportunity afforded; and she was forever\nplayfully, yet passionately underneath the surface, fighting him for\npossession of the great black guns. These he would never yield to her.\nAnd so in that manner their hands were often and long in contact. The\nmore of simplicity that she sensed in him the greater the advantage she\ntook.\n\nShe had a trick of changing--and it was not altogether voluntary--from\nthis gay, thoughtless, girlish coquettishness to the silence and the\nbrooding, burning mystery of a woman's mood. The strength and passion\nand fire of her were in her eyes, and she so used them that Lassiter had\nto see this depth in her, this haunting promise more fitted to her years\nthan to the flaunting guise of a wilful girl.\n\nThe July days flew by. Jane reasoned that if it were possible for her to\nbe happy during such a time, then she was happy. Little Fay completely\nfilled a long aching void in her heart. In fettering the hands of this\nLassiter she was accomplishing the greatest good of her life, and to do\ngood even in a small way rendered happiness to Jane Withersteen. She had\nattended the regular Sunday services of her church; otherwise she had\nnot gone to the village for weeks. It was unusual that none of her\nchurchmen or friends had called upon her of late; but it was neglect\nfor which she was glad. Judkins and his boy riders had experienced no\ndifficulty in driving the white herd. So these warm July days were free\nof worry, and soon Jane hoped she had passed the crisis; and for her to\nhope was presently to trust, and then to believe. She thought often of\nVenters, but in a dreamy, abstract way. She spent hours teaching and\nplaying with little Fay. And the activity of her mind centered around\nLassiter. The direction she had given her will seemed to blunt any\nbranching off of thought from that straight line. The mood came to\nobsess her.\n\nIn the end, when her awakening came, she learned that she had builded\nbetter than she knew. Lassiter, though kinder and gentler than ever, had\nparted with his quaint humor and his coldness and his tranquillity to\nbecome a restless and unhappy man. Whatever the power of his deadly\nintent toward Mormons, that passion now had a rival, the one equally\nburning and consuming. Jane Withersteen had one moment of exultation\nbefore the dawn of a strange uneasiness. What if she had made of herself\na lure, at tremendous cost to him and to her, and all in vain!\n\nThat night in the moonlit grove she summoned all her courage and,\nturning suddenly in the path, she faced Lassiter and leaned close to\nhim, so that she touched him and her eyes looked up to his.\n\n\"Lassiter!... Will you do anything for me?\"\n\nIn the moonlight she saw his dark, worn face change, and by that change\nshe seemed to feel him immovable as a wall of stone.\n\nJane slipped her hands down to the swinging gun-sheaths, and when she\nhad locked her fingers around the huge, cold handles of the guns, she\ntrembled as with a chilling ripple over all her body.\n\n\"May I take your guns?\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked, and for the first time to her his voice carried a harsh\nnote. Jane felt his hard, strong hands close round her wrists. It was\nnot wholly with intent that she leaned toward him, for the look of his\neyes and the feel of his hands made her weak.\n\n\"It's no trifle--no woman's whim--it's deep--as my heart. Let me take\nthem?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I want to keep you from killing more men--Mormons. You must let me save\nyou from more wickedness--more wanton bloodshed--\" Then the truth forced\nitself falteringly from her lips. \"You must--let--help me to keep my vow\nto Milly Erne. I swore to her--as she lay dying--that if ever any one\ncame here to avenge her--I swore I would stay his hand. Perhaps I--I\nalone can save the--the man who--who--Oh, Lassiter!... I feel that I\ncan't change you--then soon you'll be out to kill--and you'll kill\nby instinct--and among the Mormons you kill will be the\none--who... Lassiter, if you care a little for me--let me--for my\nsake--let me take your guns!\"\n\nAs if her hands had been those of a child, he unclasped their clinging\ngrip from the handles of his guns, and, pushing her away, he turned his\ngray face to her in one look of terrible realization and then strode off\ninto the shadows of the cottonwoods.\n\nWhen the first shock of her futile appeal to Lassiter had passed, Jane\ntook his cold, silent condemnation and abrupt departure not so much as a\nrefusal to her entreaty as a hurt and stunned bitterness for her\nattempt at his betrayal. Upon further thought and slow consideration of\nLassiter's past actions, she believed he would return and forgive her.\nThe man could not be hard to a woman, and she doubted that he could\nstay away from her. But at the point where she had hoped to find him\nvulnerable she now began to fear he was proof against all persuasion.\nThe iron and stone quality that she had early suspected in him had\nactually cropped out as an impregnable barrier. Nevertheless, if\nLassiter remained in Cottonwoods she would never give up her hope and\ndesire to change him. She would change him if she had to sacrifice\neverything dear to her except hope of heaven. Passionately devoted as\nshe was to her religion, she had yet refused to marry a Mormon. But a\nsituation had developed wherein self paled in the great white light of\nreligious duty of the highest order. That was the leading motive,\nthe divinely spiritual one; but there were other motives, which, like\ntentacles, aided in drawing her will to the acceptance of a possible\nabnegation. And through the watches of that sleepless night Jane\nWithersteen, in fear and sorrow and doubt, came finally to believe that\nif she must throw herself into Lassiter's arms to make him abide by\n\"Thou shalt not kill!\" she would yet do well.\n\nIn the morning she expected Lassiter at the usual hour, but she was not\nable to go at once to the court, so she sent little Fay. Mrs. Larkin was\nill and required attention. It appeared that the mother, from the time\nof her arrival at Withersteen House, had relaxed and was slowly\nlosing her hold on life. Jane had believed that absence of worry and\nresponsibility coupled with good nursing and comfort would mend Mrs.\nLarkin's broken health. Such, however, was not the case.\n\nWhen Jane did get out to the court, Fay was there alone, and at the\nmoment embarking on a dubious voyage down the stone-lined amber stream\nupon a craft of two brooms and a pillow. Fay was as delightfully wet as\nshe could possibly wish to get.\n\nClatter of hoofs distracted Fay and interrupted the scolding she was\ngleefully receiving from Jane. The sound was not the light-spirited trot\nthat Bells made when Lassiter rode him into the outer court. This was\nslower and heavier, and Jane did not recognize in it any of her other\nhorses. The appearance of Bishop Dyer startled Jane. He dismounted with\nhis rapid, jerky motion flung the bridle, and, as he turned toward the\ninner court and stalked up on the stone flags, his boots rang. In his\nauthoritative front, and in the red anger unmistakably flaming in his\nface, he reminded Jane of her father.\n\n\"Is that the Larkin pauper?\" he asked, bruskly, without any greeting to\nJane.\n\n\"It's Mrs. Larkin's little girl,\" replied Jane, slowly.\n\n\"I hear you intend to raise the child?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Of course you mean to give her Mormon bringing-up?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHis questions had been swift. She was amazed at a feeling that some one\nelse was replying for her.\n\n\"I've come to say a few things to you.\" He stopped to measure her with\nstern, speculative eye.\n\nJane Withersteen loved this man. From earliest childhood she had been\ntaught to revere and love bishops of her church. And for ten years\nBishop Dyer had been the closest friend and counselor of her father,\nand for the greater part of that period her own friend and Scriptural\nteacher. Her interpretation of her creed and her religious activity in\nfidelity to it, her acceptance of mysterious and holy Mormon truths,\nwere all invested in this Bishop. Bishop Dyer as an entity was next\nto God. He was God's mouthpiece to the little Mormon community at\nCottonwoods. God revealed himself in secret to this mortal.\n\nAnd Jane Withersteen suddenly suffered a paralyzing affront to her\nconsciousness of reverence by some strange, irresistible twist of\nthought wherein she saw this Bishop as a man. And the train of thought\nhurdled the rising, crying protests of that other self whose poise she\nhad lost. It was not her Bishop who eyed her in curious measurement. It\nwas a man who tramped into her presence without removing his hat, who\nhad no greeting for her, who had no semblance of courtesy. In looks,\nas in action, he made her think of a bull stamping cross-grained into a\ncorral. She had heard of Bishop Dyer forgetting the minister in the fury\nof a common man, and now she was to feel it. The glance by which she\nmeasured him in turn momentarily veiled the divine in the ordinary.\nHe looked a rancher; he was booted, spurred, and covered with dust; he\ncarried a gun at his hip, and she remembered that he had been known\nto use it. But during the long moment while he watched her there was\nnothing commonplace in the slow-gathering might of his wrath.\n\n\"Brother Tull has talked to me,\" he began. \"It was your father's wish\nthat you marry Tull, and my order. You refused him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You would not give up your friendship with that tramp Venters?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you'll do as _I_ order!\" he thundered. \"Why, Jane Withersteen, you\nare in danger of becoming a heretic! You can thank your Gentile friends\nfor that. You face the damning of your soul to perdition.\"\n\nIn the flux and reflux of the whirling torture of Jane's mind, that new,\ndaring spirit of hers vanished in the old habitual order of her life.\nShe was a Mormon, and the Bishop regained ascendance.\n\n\"It's well I got you in time, Jane Withersteen. What would your father\nhave said to these goings-on of yours? He would have put you in a\nstone cage on bread and water. He would have taught you something about\nMormonism. Remember, you're a born Mormon. There have been Mormons who\nturned heretic--damn their souls!--but no born Mormon ever left us yet.\nAh, I see your shame. Your faith is not shaken. You are only a wild\ngirl.\" The Bishop's tone softened. \"Well, it's enough that I got to you\nin time.... Now tell me about this Lassiter. I hear strange things.\"\n\n\"What do you wish to know?\" queried Jane.\n\n\"About this man. You hired him?\"\n\n\"Yes, he's riding for me. When my riders left me I had to have any one I\ncould get.\"\n\n\"Is it true what I hear--that he's a gun-man, a Mormon-hater, steeped in\nblood?\"\n\n\"True--terribly true, I fear.\"\n\n\"But what's he doing here in Cottonwoods? This place isn't notorious\nenough for such a man. Sterling and the villages north, where there's\nuniversal gun-packing and fights every day--where there are more men\nlike him, it seems to me they would attract him most. We're only a wild,\nlonely border settlement. It's only recently that the rustlers have made\nkillings here. Nor have there been saloons till lately, nor the drifting\nin of outcasts. Has not this gun-man some special mission here?\"\n\nJane maintained silence.\n\n\"Tell me,\" ordered Bishop Dyer, sharply.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\n\"Do you know what it is?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Tell me that.\"\n\n\"Bishop Dyer, I don't want to tell.\"\n\nHe waved his hand in an imperative gesture of command. The red once more\nleaped to his face, and in his steel-blue eyes glinted a pin-point of\ncuriosity.\n\n\"That first day,\" whispered Jane, \"Lassiter said he came here to\nfind--Milly Erne's grave!\"\n\nWith downcast eyes Jane watched the swift flow of the amber water. She\nsaw it and tried to think of it, of the stones, of the ferns; but, like\nher body, her mind was in a leaden vise. Only the Bishop's voice could\nrelease her. Seemingly there was silence of longer duration than all her\nformer life.\n\n\"For what--else?\" When Bishop Dyer's voice did cleave the silence it was\nhigh, curiously shrill, and on the point of breaking. It released Jane's\ntongue, but she could not lift her eyes.\n\n\"To kill the man who persuaded Milly Erne to abandon her home and her\nhusband--and her God!\"\n\nWith wonderful distinctness Jane Withersteen heard her own clear voice.\nShe heard the water murmur at her feet and flow on to the sea; she heard\nthe rushing of all the waters in the world. They filled her ears with\nlow, unreal murmurings--these sounds that deadened her brain and\nyet could not break the long and terrible silence. Then, from\nsomewhere--from an immeasurable distance--came a slow, guarded,\nclinking, clanking step. Into her it shot electrifying life. It released\nthe weight upon her numbed eyelids. Lifting her eyes she saw--ashen,\nshaken, stricken--not the Bishop but the man! And beyond him, from\nround the corner came that soft, silvery step. A long black boot with a\ngleaming spur swept into sight--and then Lassiter! Bishop Dyer did not\nsee, did not hear: he stared at Jane in the throes of sudden revelation.\n\n\"Ah, I understand!\" he cried, in hoarse accents. \"That's why you made\nlove to this Lassiter--to bind his hands!\"\n\nIt was Jane's gaze riveted upon the rider that made Bishop Dyer turn.\nThen clear sight failed her. Dizzily, in a blur, she saw the Bishop's\nhand jerk to his hip. She saw gleam of blue and spout of red. In her\nears burst a thundering report. The court floated in darkening circles\naround her, and she fell into utter blackness.\n\nThe darkness lightened, turned to slow-drifting haze, and lifted.\nThrough a thin film of blue smoke she saw the rough-hewn timbers of\nthe court roof. A cool, damp touch moved across her brow. She smelled\npowder, and it was that which galvanized her suspended thought. She\nmoved, to see that she lay prone upon the stone flags with her head on\nLassiter's knee, and he was bathing her brow with water from the stream.\nThe same swift glance, shifting low, brought into range of her sight a\nsmoking gun and splashes of blood.\n\n\"Ah-h!\" she moaned, and was drifting, sinking again into darkness, when\nLassiter's voice arrested her.\n\n\"It's all right, Jane. It's all right.\"\n\n\"Did--you--kill--him?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Who? That fat party who was here? No. I didn't kill him.\"\n\n\"Oh!... Lassiter!\"\n\n\"Say! It was queer for you to faint. I thought you were such a strong\nwoman, not faintish like that. You're all right now--only some pale.\nI thought you'd never come to. But I'm awkward round women folks. I\ncouldn't think of anythin'.\"\n\n\"Lassiter!... the gun there!... the blood!\"\n\n\"So that's troublin' you. I reckon it needn't. You see it was this way.\nI come round the house an' seen that fat party an' heard him talkin'\nloud. Then he seen me, an' very impolite goes straight for his gun. He\noughtn't have tried to throw a gun on me--whatever his reason was. For\nthat's meetin' me on my own grounds. I've seen runnin' molasses that\nwas quicker 'n him. Now I didn't know who he was, visitor or friend\nor relation of yours, though I seen he was a Mormon all over, an' I\ncouldn't get serious about shootin'. So I winged him--put a bullet\nthrough his arm as he was pullin' at his gun. An' he dropped the\ngun there, an' a little blood. I told him he'd introduced himself\nsufficient, an' to please move out of my vicinity. An' he went.\"\n\nLassiter spoke with slow, cool, soothing voice, in which there was a\nhint of levity, and his touch, as he continued to bathe her brow, was\ngentle and steady. His impassive face, and the kind gray eyes, further\nstilled her agitation.\n\n\"He drew on you first, and you deliberately shot to cripple him--you\nwouldn't kill him--you--Lassiter?\"\n\n\"That's about the size of it.\"\n\nJane kissed his hand.\n\nAll that was calm and cool about Lassiter instantly vanished.\n\n\"Don't do that! I won't stand it! An' I don't care a damn who that fat\nparty was.\"\n\nHe helped Jane to her feet and to a chair. Then with the wet scarf he\nhad used to bathe her face he wiped the blood from the stone flags and,\npicking up the gun, he threw it upon a couch. With that he began to\npace the court, and his silver spurs jangled musically, and the great\ngun-sheaths softly brushed against his leather chaps.\n\n\"So--it's true--what I heard him say?\" Lassiter asked, presently halting\nbefore her. \"You made love to me--to bind my hands?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" confessed Jane. It took all her woman's courage to meet the gray\nstorm of his glance.\n\n\"All these days that you've been so friendly an' like a pardner--all\nthese evenin's that have been so bewilderin' to me--your\nbeauty--an'--an' the way you looked an' came close to me--they were\nwoman's tricks to bind my hands?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"An' your sweetness that seemed so natural, an' your throwin' little Fay\nan' me so much together--to make me love the child--all that was for the\nsame reason?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLassiter flung his arms--a strange gesture for him.\n\n\"Mebbe it wasn't much in your Mormon thinkin', for you to play that\ngame. But to ring the child in--that was hellish!\"\n\nJane's passionate, unheeding zeal began to loom darkly.\n\n\"Lassiter, whatever my intention in the beginning, Fay loves you\ndearly--and I--I've grown to--to like you.\"\n\n\"That's powerful kind of you, now,\" he said. Sarcasm and scorn made his\nvoice that of a stranger. \"An' you sit there an' look me straight in the\neyes! You're a wonderful strange woman, Jane Withersteen.\"\n\n\"I'm not ashamed, Lassiter. I told you I'd try to change you.\"\n\n\"Would you mind tellin' me just what you tried?\"\n\n\"I tried to make you see beauty in me and be softened by it. I wanted\nyou to care for me so that I could influence you. It wasn't easy. At\nfirst you were stone-blind. Then I hoped you'd love little Fay, and\nthrough that come to feel the horror of making children fatherless.\"\n\n\"Jane Withersteen, either you're a fool or noble beyond my\nunderstandin'. Mebbe you're both. I know you're blind. What you meant is\none thing--what you did was to make me love you.\"\n\n\"Lassiter!\"\n\n\"I reckon I'm a human bein', though I never loved any one but my sister,\nMilly Erne. That was long--\"\n\n\"Oh, are you Milly's brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was, an' I loved her. There never was any one but her in my life\ntill now. Didn't I tell you that long ago I back-trailed myself from\nwomen? I was a Texas ranger till--till Milly left home, an' then I\nbecame somethin' else--Lassiter! For years I've been a lonely man set on\none thing. I came here an' met you. An' now I'm not the man I was. The\nchange was gradual, an' I took no notice of it. I understand now that\nnever-satisfied longin' to see you, listen to you, watch you, feel you\nnear me. It's plain now why you were never out of my thoughts. I've had\nno thoughts but of you. I've lived an' breathed for you. An' now when I\nknow what it means--what you've done--I'm burnin' up with hell's fire!\"\n\n\"Oh, Lassiter--no--no--you don't love me that way!\" Jane cased.\n\n\"If that's what love is, then I do.\"\n\n\"Forgive me! I didn't mean to make you love me like that. Oh, what a\ntangle of our lives! You--Milly Erne's brother! And I--heedless, mad to\nmelt your heart toward Mormons. Lassiter, I may be wicked but not wicked\nenough to hate. If I couldn't hate Tull, could I hate you?\"\n\n\"After all, Jane, mebbe you're only blind--Mormon blind. That only can\nexplain what's close to selfishness--\"\n\n\"I'm not selfish. I despise the very word. If I were free--\"\n\n\"But you're not free. Not free of Mormonism. An' in playin' this game\nwith me you've been unfaithful.\"\n\n\"Un-faithful!\" faltered Jane.\n\n\"Yes, I said unfaithful. You're faithful to your Bishop an' unfaithful\nto yourself. You're false to your womanhood an' true to your\nreligion. But for a savin' innocence you'd have made yourself low an'\nvile--betrayin' yourself, betrayin' me--all to bind my hands an' keep me\nfrom snuffin' out Mormon life. It's your damned Mormon blindness.\"\n\n\"Is it vile--is it blind--is it only Mormonism to save human life? No,\nLassiter, that's God's law, divine, universal for all Christians.\"\n\n\"The blindness I mean is blindness that keeps you from seein' the truth.\nI've known many good Mormons. But some are blacker than hell. You won't\nsee that even when you know it. Else, why all this blind passion to save\nthe life of that--that....\"\n\nJane shut out the light, and the hands she held over her eyes trembled\nand quivered against her face.\n\n\"Blind--yes, en' let me make it clear en' simple to you,\" Lassiter went\non, his voice losing its tone of anger. \"Take, for instance, that idea\nof yours last night when you wanted my guns. It was good an' beautiful,\nan' showed your heart--but--why, Jane, it was crazy. Mind I'm assumin'\nthat life to me is as sweet as to any other man. An' to preserve that\nlife is each man's first an' closest thought. Where would any man be on\nthis border without guns? Where, especially, would Lassiter be? Well,\nI'd be under the sage with thousands of other men now livin' an' sure\nbetter men than me. Gun-packin' in the West since the Civil War has\ngrowed into a kind of moral law. An' out here on this border it's the\ndifference between a man an' somethin' not a man. Look what your takin'\nVenters's guns from him all but made him! Why, your churchmen carry\nguns. Tull has killed a man an' drawed on others. Your Bishop has shot\na half dozen men, an' it wasn't through prayers of his that they\nrecovered. An' to-day he'd have shot me if he'd been quick enough on the\ndraw. Could I walk or ride down into Cottonwoods without my guns?\nThis is a wild time, Jane Withersteen, this year of our Lord eighteen\nseventy-one.\"\n\n\"No time--for a woman!\" exclaimed Jane, brokenly. \"Oh, Lassiter, I feel\nhelpless--lost--and don't know where to turn. If I am blind--then--I\nneed some one--a friend--you, Lassiter--more than ever!\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't say nothin' about goin' back on you, did I?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE INVISIBLE HAND\n\nJane received a letter from Bishop Dyer, not in his own handwriting,\nwhich stated that the abrupt termination of their interview had left\nhim in some doubt as to her future conduct. A slight injury had\nincapacitated him from seeking another meeting at present, the letter\nwent on to say, and ended with a request which was virtually a command,\nthat she call upon him at once.\n\nThe reading of the letter acquainted Jane Withersteen with the fact that\nsomething within her had all but changed. She sent no reply to Bishop\nDyer nor did she go to see him. On Sunday she remained absent from the\nservice--for the second time in years--and though she did not actually\nsuffer there was a dead-lock of feelings deep within her, and the\nwaiting for a balance to fall on either side was almost as bad as\nsuffering. She had a gloomy expectancy of untoward circumstances,\nand with it a keen-edged curiosity to watch developments. She had\na half-formed conviction that her future conduct--as related to her\nchurchmen--was beyond her control and would be governed by their\nattitude toward her. Something was changing in her, forming, waiting for\ndecision to make it a real and fixed thing. She had told Lassiter that\nshe felt helpless and lost in the fateful tangle of their lives; and now\nshe feared that she was approaching the same chaotic condition of mind\nin regard to her religion. It appalled her to find that she questioned\nphases of that religion. Absolute faith had been her serenity. Though\nleaving her faith unshaken, her serenity had been disturbed, and now\nit was broken by open war between her and her ministers. That something\nwithin her--a whisper--which she had tried in vain to hush had become\na ringing voice, and it called to her to wait. She had transgressed\nno laws of God. Her churchmen, however invested with the power and the\nglory of a wonderful creed, however they sat in inexorable judgment of\nher, must now practice toward her the simple, common, Christian virtue\nthey professed to preach, \"Do unto others as you would have others do\nunto you!\"\n\nJane Withersteen, waiting in darkness of mind, remained faithful still.\nBut it was darkness that must soon be pierced by light. If her faith\nwere justified, if her churchmen were trying only to intimidate her, the\nfact would soon be manifest, as would their failure, and then she would\nredouble her zeal toward them and toward what had been the best work\nof her life--work for the welfare and happiness of those among whom she\nlived, Mormon and Gentile alike. If that secret, intangible power closed\nits coils round her again, if that great invisible hand moved here and\nthere and everywhere, slowly paralyzing her with its mystery and its\ninconceivable sway over her affairs, then she would know beyond doubt\nthat it was not chance, nor jealousy, nor intimidation, nor ministerial\nwrath at her revolt, but a cold and calculating policy thought out long\nbefore she was born, a dark, immutable will of whose empire she and all\nthat was hers was but an atom.\n\nThen might come her ruin. Then might come her fall into black storm.\nYet she would rise again, and to the light. God would be merciful to a\ndriven woman who had lost her way.\n\nA week passed. Little Fay played and prattled and pulled at Lassiter's\nbig black guns. The rider came to Withersteen House oftener than ever.\nJane saw a change in him, though it did not relate to his kindness and\ngentleness. He was quieter and more thoughtful. While playing with Fay\nor conversing with Jane he seemed to be possessed of another self that\nwatched with cool, roving eyes, that listened, listened always as if the\nmurmuring amber stream brought messages, and the moving leaves whispered\nsomething. Lassiter never rode Bells into the court any more, nor did\nhe come by the lane or the paths. When he appeared it was suddenly and\nnoiselessly out of the dark shadow of the grove.\n\n\"I left Bells out in the sage,\" he said, one day at the end of that\nweek. \"I must carry water to him.\"\n\n\"Why not let him drink at the trough or here?\" asked Jane, quickly.\n\n\"I reckon it'll be safer for me to slip through the grove. I've been\nwatched when I rode in from the sage.\"\n\n\"Watched? By whom?\"\n\n\"By a man who thought he was well hid. But my eyes are pretty sharp.\nAn', Jane,\" he went on, almost in a whisper, \"I reckon it'd be a good\nidea for us to talk low. You're spied on here by your women.\"\n\n\"Lassiter!\" she whispered in turn. \"That's hard to believe. My women\nlove me.\"\n\n\"What of that?\" he asked. \"Of course they love you. But they're Mormon\nwomen.\"\n\nJane's old, rebellious loyalty clashed with her doubt.\n\n\"I won't believe it,\" she replied, stubbornly.\n\n\"Well then, just act natural an' talk natural, an' pretty soon--give\nthem time to hear us--pretend to go over there to the table, en' then\nquick-like make a move for the door en' open it.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Jane, with heightened color. Lassiter was right; he never\nmade mistakes; he would not have told her unless he positively knew. Yet\nJane was so tenacious of faith that she had to see with her own eyes,\nand so constituted that to employ even such small deceit toward her\nwomen made her ashamed, and angry for her shame as well as theirs. Then\na singular thought confronted her that made her hold up this simple\nruse--which hurt her, though it was well justified--against the deceit\nshe had wittingly and eagerly used toward Lassiter. The difference was\nstaggering in its suggestion of that blindness of which he had accused\nher. Fairness and justice and mercy, that she had imagined were\nanchor-cables to hold fast her soul to righteousness had not been hers\nin the strange, biased duty that had so exalted and confounded her.\n\nPresently Jane began to act her little part, to laugh and play with\nFay, to talk of horses and cattle to Lassiter. Then she made deliberate\nmention of a book in which she kept records of all pertaining to her\nstock, and she walked slowly toward the table, and when near the door\nshe suddenly whirled and thrust it open. Her sharp action nearly knocked\ndown a woman who had undoubtedly been listening.\n\n\"Hester,\" said Jane, sternly, \"you may go home, and you need not come\nback.\"\n\nJane shut the door and returned to Lassiter. Standing unsteadily, she\nput her hand on his arm. She let him see that doubt had gone, and how\nthis stab of disloyalty pained her.\n\n\"Spies! My own women!... Oh, miserable!\" she cried, with flashing,\ntearful eyes.\n\n\"I hate to tell you,\" he replied. By that she knew he had long spared\nher. \"It's begun again--that work in the dark.\"\n\n\"Nay, Lassiter--it never stopped!\"\n\nSo bitter certainty claimed her at last, and trust fled Withersteen\nHouse and fled forever. The women who owed much to Jane Withersteen\nchanged not in love for her, nor in devotion to their household work,\nbut they poisoned both by a thousand acts of stealth and cunning and\nduplicity. Jane broke out once and caught them in strange, stone-faced,\nunhesitating falsehood. Thereafter she broke out no more. She forgave\nthem because they were driven. Poor, fettered, and sealed Hagars, how\nshe pitied them! What terrible thing bound them and locked their\nlips, when they showed neither consciousness of guilt toward their\nbenefactress nor distress at the slow wearing apart of long-established\nand dear ties?\n\n\"The blindness again!\" cried Jane Withersteen. \"In my sisters as in\nme!... O God!\"\n\nThere came a time when no words passed between Jane and her women.\nSilently they went about their household duties, and secretly they went\nabout the underhand work to which they had been bidden. The gloom of\nthe house and the gloom of its mistress, which darkened even the bright\nspirit of little Fay, did not pervade these women. Happiness was not\namong them, but they were aloof from gloom. They spied and listened;\nthey received and sent secret messengers; and they stole Jane's books\nand records, and finally the papers that were deeds of her possessions.\nThrough it all they were silent, rapt in a kind of trance. Then one by\none, without leave or explanation or farewell, they left Withersteen\nHouse, and never returned.\n\nCoincident with this disappearance Jane's gardeners and workers in the\nalfalfa fields and stable men quit her, not even asking for their wages.\nOf all her Mormon employees about the great ranch only Jerd remained. He\nwent on with his duty, but talked no more of the change than if it had\nnever occurred.\n\n\"Jerd,\" said Jane, \"what stock you can't take care of turn out in the\nsage. Let your first thought be for Black Star and Night. Keep them in\nperfect condition. Run them every day and watch them always.\"\n\nThough Jane Withersteen gave them such liberality, she loved her\npossessions. She loved the rich, green stretches of alfalfa, and the\nfarms, and the grove, and the old stone house, and the beautiful,\never-faithful amber spring, and every one of a myriad of horses and\ncolts and burros and fowls down to the smallest rabbit that nipped her\nvegetables; but she loved best her noble Arabian steeds. In common with\nall riders of the upland sage Jane cherished two material things--the\ncold, sweet, brown water that made life possible in the wilderness and\nthe horses which were a part of that life. When Lassiter asked her what\nLassiter would be without his guns he was assuming that his horse was\npart of himself. So Jane loved Black Star and Night because it was her\nnature to love all beautiful creatures--perhaps all living things; and\nthen she loved them because she herself was of the sage and in her\nhad been born and bred the rider's instinct to rely on his four-footed\nbrother. And when Jane gave Jerd the order to keep her favorites trained\ndown to the day it was a half-conscious admission that presaged a time\nwhen she would need her fleet horses.\n\nJane had now, however, no leisure to brood over the coils that were\nclosing round her. Mrs. Larkin grew weaker as the August days began;\nshe required constant care; there was little Fay to look after; and such\nhousehold work as was imperative. Lassiter put Bells in the stable with\nthe other racers, and directed his efforts to a closer attendance upon\nJane. She welcomed the change. He was always at hand to help, and it was\nher fortune to learn that his boast of being awkward around women had\nits root in humility and was not true.\n\nHis great, brown hands were skilled in a multiplicity of ways which a\nwoman might have envied. He shared Jane's work, and was of especial help\nto her in nursing Mrs. Larkin. The woman suffered most at night, and\nthis often broke Jane's rest. So it came about that Lassiter would stay\nby Mrs. Larkin during the day, when she needed care, and Jane would make\nup the sleep she lost in night-watches. Mrs. Larkin at once took kindly\nto the gentle Lassiter, and, without ever asking who or what he was,\npraised him to Jane. \"He's a good man and loves children,\" she said. How\nsad to hear this truth spoken of a man whom Jane thought lost beyond all\nredemption! Yet ever and ever Lassiter towered above her, and behind\nor through his black, sinister figure shone something luminous that\nstrangely affected Jane. Good and evil began to seem incomprehensibly\nblended in her judgment. It was her belief that evil could not come\nforth from good; yet here was a murderer who dwarfed in gentleness,\npatience, and love any man she had ever known.\n\nShe had almost lost track of her more outside concerns when early one\nmorning Judkins presented himself before her in the courtyard.\n\nThin, hard, burnt, bearded, with the dust and sage thick on him, with\nhis leather wrist-bands shining from use, and his boots worn through on\nthe stirrup side, he looked the rider of riders. He wore two guns and\ncarried a Winchester.\n\nJane greeted him with surprise and warmth, set meat and bread and\ndrink before him; and called Lassiter out to see him. The men exchanged\nglances, and the meaning of Lassiter's keen inquiry and Judkins's bold\nreply, both unspoken, was not lost upon Jane.\n\n\"Where's your hoss?\" asked Lassiter, aloud.\n\n\"Left him down the slope,\" answered Judkins. \"I footed it in a ways, an'\nslept last night in the sage. I went to the place you told me you 'moss\nalways slept, but didn't strike you.\"\n\n\"I moved up some, near the spring, an' now I go there nights.\"\n\n\"Judkins--the white herd?\" queried Jane, hurriedly.\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, I make proud to say I've not lost a steer. Fer a good\nwhile after thet stampede Lassiter milled we hed no trouble. Why, even\nthe sage dogs left us. But it's begun agin--thet flashin' of lights\nover ridge tips, an' queer puffin' of smoke, en' then at night strange\nwhistles en' noises. But the herd's acted magnificent. An' my boys, say,\nMiss Withersteen, they're only kids, but I ask no better riders. I got\nthe laugh in the village fer takin' them out. They're a wild lot, an'\nyou know boys hev more nerve than grown men, because they don't know\nwhat danger is. I'm not denyin' there's danger. But they glory in it,\nan' mebbe I like it myself--anyway, we'll stick. We're goin' to drive\nthe herd on the far side of the first break of Deception Pass. There's\na great round valley over there, an' no ridges or piles of rocks to aid\nthese stampeders. The rains are due. We'll hev plenty of water fer a\nwhile. An' we can hold thet herd from anybody except Oldrin'. I come\nin fer supplies. I'll pack a couple of burros an' drive out after dark\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Judkins, take what you want from the store-room. Lassiter will help\nyou. I--I can't thank you enough... but--wait.\"\n\nJane went to the room that had once been her father's, and from a secret\nchamber in the thick stone wall she took a bag of gold, and, carrying it\nback to the court, she gave it to the rider.\n\n\"There, Judkins, and understand that I regard it as little for your\nloyalty. Give what is fair to your boys, and keep the rest. Hide it.\nPerhaps that would be wisest.\"\n\n\"Oh... Miss Withersteen!\" ejaculated the rider. \"I couldn't earn so much\nin--in ten years. It's not right--I oughtn't take it.\"\n\n\"Judkins, you know I'm a rich woman. I tell you I've few faithful\nfriends. I've fallen upon evil days. God only knows what will become of\nme and mine! So take the gold.\"\n\nShe smiled in understanding of his speechless gratitude, and left him\nwith Lassiter. Presently she heard him speaking low at first, then in\nlouder accents emphasized by the thumping of his rifle on the stones.\n\"As infernal a job as even you, Lassiter, ever heerd of.\"\n\n\"Why, son,\" was Lassiter's reply, \"this breakin' of Miss Withersteen may\nseem bad to you, but it ain't bad--yet. Some of these wall-eyed fellers\nwho look jest as if they was walkin' in the shadow of Christ himself,\nright down the sunny road, now they can think of things en' do things\nthat are really hell-bent.\"\n\nJane covered her ears and ran to her own room, and there like caged\nlioness she paced to and fro till the coming of little Fay reversed her\ndark thoughts.\n\nThe following day, a warm and muggy one threatening rain awhile Jane was\nresting in the court, a horseman clattered through the grove and up to\nthe hitching-rack. He leaped off and approached Jane with the manner\nof a man determined to execute difficult mission, yet fearful of its\nreception. In the gaunt, wiry figure and the lean, brown face Jane\nrecognized one of her Mormon riders, Blake. It was he of whom Judkins\nhad long since spoken. Of all the riders ever in her employ Blake owed\nher the most, and as he stepped before her, removing his hat and making\nmanly efforts to subdue his emotion, he showed that he remembered.\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, mother's dead,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh--Blake!\" exclaimed Jane, and she could say no more.\n\n\"She died free from pain in the end, and she's buried--resting at last,\nthank God!... I've come to ride for you again, if you'll have me. Don't\nthink I mentioned mother to get your sympathy. When she was living\nand your riders quit, I had to also. I was afraid of what might be\ndone--said to her.... Miss Withersteen, we can't talk of--of what's going\non now--\"\n\n\"Blake, do you know?\"\n\n\"I know a great deal. You understand, my lips are shut. But without\nexplanation or excuse I offer my services. I'm a Mormon--I hope a good\none. But--there are some things!... It's no use, Miss Withersteen, I\ncan't say any more--what I'd like to. But will you take me back?\"\n\n\"Blake!... You know what it means?\"\n\n\"I don't care. I'm sick of--of--I'll show you a Mormon who'll be true to\nyou!\"\n\n\"But, Blake--how terribly you might suffer for that!\"\n\n\"Maybe. Aren't you suffering now?\"\n\n\"God knows indeed I am!\"\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, it's a liberty on my part to speak so, but I know you\npretty well--know you'll never give in. I wouldn't if I were you. And\nI--I must--Something makes me tell you the worst is yet to come. That's\nall. I absolutely can't say more. Will you take me back--let me ride for\nyou--show everybody what I mean?\"\n\n\"Blake, it makes me happy to hear you. How my riders hurt me when they\nquit!\" Jane felt the hot tears well to her eyes and splash down upon her\nhands. \"I thought so much of them--tried so hard to be good to them. And\nnot one was true. You've made it easy to forgive. Perhaps many of\nthem really feel as you do, but dare not return to me. Still, Blake, I\nhesitate to take you back. Yet I want you so much.\"\n\n\"Do it, then. If you're going to make your life a lesson to Mormon\nwomen, let me make mine a lesson to the men. Right is right. I believe\nin you, and here's my life to prove it.\"\n\n\"You hint it may mean your life!\" said Jane, breathless and low.\n\n\"We won't speak of that. I want to come back. I want to do what every\nrider aches in his secret heart to do for you.... Miss Withersteen, I\nhoped it'd not be necessary to tell you that my mother on her deathbed\ntold me to have courage. She knew how the thing galled me--she told me\nto come back.... Will you take me?\"\n\n\"God bless you, Blake! Yes, I'll take you back. And will you--will you\naccept gold from me?\"\n\n\"Miss Withersteen!\"\n\n\"I just gave Judkins a bag of gold. I'll give you one. If you will\nnot take it you must not come back. You might ride for me a few\nmonths--weeks--days till the storm breaks. Then you'd have nothing, and\nbe in disgrace with your people. We'll forearm you against poverty, and\nme against endless regret. I'll give you gold which you can hide--till\nsome future time.\"\n\n\"Well, if it pleases you,\" replied Blake. \"But you know I never thought\nof pay. Now, Miss Withersteen, one thing more. I want to see this man\nLassiter. Is he here?\"\n\n\"Yes, but, Blake--what--Need you see him? Why?\" asked Jane, instantly\nworried. \"I can speak to him--tell him about you.\"\n\n\"That won't do. I want to--I've got to tell him myself. Where is he?\"\n\n\"Lassiter is with Mrs. Larkin. She is ill. I'll call him,\" answered\nJane, and going to the door she softly called for the rider. A faint,\nmusical jingle preceded his step--then his tall form crossed the\nthreshold.\n\n\"Lassiter, here's Blake, an old rider of mine. He has come back to me\nand he wishes to speak to you.\"\n\nBlake's brown face turned exceedingly pale.\n\n\"Yes, I had to speak to you,\" he said, swiftly. \"My name's Blake. I'm a\nMormon and a rider. Lately I quit Miss Withersteen. I've come to beg her\nto take me back. Now I don't know you; but I know--what you are. So\nI've this to say to your face. It would never occur to this woman to\nimagine--let alone suspect me to be a spy. She couldn't think it\nmight just be a low plot to come here and shoot you in the back. Jane\nWithersteen hasn't that kind of a mind.... Well, I've not come for that.\nI want to help her--to pull a bridle along with Judkins and--and you.\nThe thing is--do you believe me?\"\n\n\"I reckon I do,\" replied Lassiter. How this slow, cool speech contrasted\nwith Blake's hot, impulsive words! \"You might have saved some of your\nbreath. See here, Blake, cinch this in your mind. Lassiter has met some\nsquare Mormons! An' mebbe--\"\n\n\"Blake,\" interrupted Jane, nervously anxious to terminate a colloquy\nthat she perceived was an ordeal for him. \"Go at once and fetch me a\nreport of my horses.\"\n\n\"Miss Withersteen!... You mean the big drove--down in the sage-cleared\nfields?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Jane. \"My horses are all there, except the blooded\nstock I keep here.\"\n\n\"Haven't you heard--then?\"\n\n\"Heard? No! What's happened to them?\"\n\n\"They're gone, Miss Withersteen, gone these ten days past. Dorn told me,\nand I rode down to see for myself.\"\n\n\"Lassiter--did you know?\" asked Jane, whirling to him.\n\n\"I reckon so.... But what was the use to tell you?\"\n\nIt was Lassiter turning away his face and Blake studying the stone flags\nat his feet that brought Jane to the understanding of what she betrayed.\nShe strove desperately, but she could not rise immediately from such a\nblow.\n\n\"My horses! My horses! What's become of them?\"\n\n\"Dorn said the riders report another drive by Oldring.... And I trailed\nthe horses miles down the slope toward Deception Pass.\"\n\n\"My red herd's gone! My horses gone! The white herd will go next. I can\nstand that. But if I lost Black Star and Night, it would be like parting\nwith my own flesh and blood. Lassiter--Blake--am I in danger of losing\nmy racers?\"\n\n\"A rustler--or--or anybody stealin' hosses of yours would most of all\nwant the blacks,\" said Lassiter. His evasive reply was affirmative\nenough. The other rider nodded gloomy acquiescence.\n\n\"Oh! Oh!\" Jane Withersteen choked, with violent utterance.\n\n\"Let me take charge of the blacks?\" asked Blake. \"One more rider won't\nbe any great help to Judkins. But I might hold Black Star and Night, if\nyou put such store on their value.\"\n\n\"Value! Blake, I love my racers. Besides, there's another reason why I\nmustn't lose them. You go to the stables. Go with Jerd every day when\nhe runs the horses, and don't let them out of your sight. If you would\nplease me--win my gratitude, guard my black racers.\"\n\nWhen Blake had mounted and ridden out of the court Lassiter regarded\nJane with the smile that was becoming rarer as the days sped by.\n\n\"'Pears to me, as Blake says, you do put some store on them hosses. Now\nI ain't gainsayin' that the Arabians are the handsomest hosses I ever\nseen. But Bells can beat Night, an' run neck en' neck with Black Star.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, don't tease me now. I'm miserable--sick. Bells is fast, but\nhe can't stay with the blacks, and you know it. Only Wrangle can do\nthat.\"\n\n\"I'll bet that big raw-boned brute can more'n show his heels to your\nblack racers. Jane, out there in the sage, on a long chase, Wrangle\ncould kill your favorites.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Jane, impatiently. \"Lassiter, why do you say that\nso often? I know you've teased me at times, and I believe it's only\nkindness. You're always trying to keep my mind off worry. But you mean\nmore by this repeated mention of my racers?\"\n\n\"I reckon so.\" Lassiter paused, and for the thousandth time in her\npresence moved his black sombrero round and round, as if counting the\nsilver pieces on the band. \"Well, Jane, I've sort of read a little\nthat's passin' in your mind.\"\n\n\"You think I might fly from my home--from Cottonwoods--from the Utah\nborder?\"\n\n\"I reckon. An' if you ever do an' get away with the blacks I wouldn't\nlike to see Wrangle left here on the sage. Wrangle could catch you. I\nknow Venters had him. But you can never tell. Mebbe he hasn't got him\nnow.... Besides--things are happenin', an' somethin' of the same queer\nnature might have happened to Venters.\"\n\n\"God knows you're right!... Poor Bern, how long he's gone! In my trouble\nI've been forgetting him. But, Lassiter, I've little fear for him. I've\nheard my riders say he's as keen as a wolf.... As to your reading my\nthoughts--well, your suggestion makes an actual thought of what was\nonly one of my dreams. I believe I dreamed of flying from this wild\nborderland, Lassiter. I've strange dreams. I'm not always practical\nand thinking of my many duties, as you said once. For instance--if I\ndared--if I dared I'd ask you to saddle the blacks and ride away with\nme--and hide me.\"\n\n\"Jane!\"\n\nThe rider's sunburnt face turned white. A few times Jane had seen\nLassiter's cool calm broken--when he had met little Fay, when he had\nlearned how and why he had come to love both child and mistress, when he\nhad stood beside Milly Erne's grave. But one and all they could not be\nconsidered in the light of his present agitation. Not only did Lassiter\nturn white--not only did he grow tense, not only did he lose his\ncoolness, but also he suddenly, violently, hungrily took her into his\narms and crushed her to his breast.\n\n\"Lassiter!\" cried Jane, trembling. It was an action for which she took\nsole blame. Instantly, as if dazed, weakened, he released her. \"Forgive\nme!\" went on Jane. \"I'm always forgetting your--your feelings. I thought\nof you as my faithful friend. I'm always making you out more than\nhuman... only, let me say--I meant that--about riding away. I'm wretched,\nsick of this--this--Oh, something bitter and black grows on my heart!\"\n\n\"Jane, the hell--of it,\" he replied, with deep intake of breath, \"is you\ncan't ride away. Mebbe realizin' it accounts for my grabbin' you--that\nway, as much as the crazy boy's rapture your words gave me. I don't\nunderstand myself.... But the hell of this game is--you can't ride away.\"\n\n\"Lassiter!... What on earth do you mean? I'm an absolutely free woman.\"\n\n\"You ain't absolutely anythin' of the kind.... I reckon I've got to tell\nyou!\"\n\n\"Tell me all. It's uncertainty that makes me a coward. It's faith and\nhope--blind love, if you will, that makes me miserable. Every day I\nawake believing--still believing. The day grows, and with it doubts,\nfears, and that black bat hate that bites hotter and hotter into my\nheart. Then comes night--I pray--I pray for all, and for myself--I\nsleep--and I awake free once more, trustful, faithful, to believe--to\nhope! Then, O my God! I grow and live a thousand years till night\nagain!... But if you want to see me a woman, tell me why I can't ride\naway--tell me what more I'm to lose--tell me the worst.\"\n\n\"Jane, you're watched. There's no single move of yours, except when\nyou're hid in your house, that ain't seen by sharp eyes. The cottonwood\ngrove's full of creepin', crawlin' men. Like Indians in the grass. When\nyou rode, which wasn't often lately, the sage was full of sneakin' men.\nAt night they crawl under your windows into the court, an' I reckon into\nthe house. Jane Withersteen, you know, never locked a door! This here\ngrove's a hummin' bee-hive of mysterious happenin's. Jane, it ain't so\nmuch that these soles keep out of my way as me keepin' out of theirs.\nThey're goin' to try to kill me. That's plain. But mebbe I'm as hard to\nshoot in the back as in the face. So far I've seen fit to watch\nonly. This all means, Jane, that you're a marked woman. You can't get\naway--not now. Mebbe later, when you're broken, you might. But that's\nsure doubtful. Jane, you're to lose the cattle that's left--your home\nan' ranch--an' Amber Spring. You can't even hide a sack of gold! For it\ncouldn't be slipped out of the house, day or night, an' hid or buried,\nlet alone be rid off with. You may lose all. I'm tellin' you, Jane,\nhopin' to prepare you, if the worst does come. I told you once before\nabout that strange power I've got to feel things.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, what can I do?\"\n\n\"Nothin', I reckon, except know what's comin' an' wait an' be game. If\nyou'd let me make a call on Tull, an' a long-deferred call on--\"\n\n\"Hush!... Hush!\" she whispered.\n\n\"Well, even that wouldn't help you any in the end.\"\n\n\"What does it mean? Oh, what does it mean? I am my father's daughter--a\nMormon, yet I can't see! I've not failed in religion--in duty. For years\nI've given with a free and full heart. When my father died I was rich.\nIf I'm still rich it's because I couldn't find enough ways to become\npoor. What am I, what are my possessions to set in motion such intensity\nof secret oppression?\"\n\n\"Jane, the mind behind it all is an empire builder.\"\n\n\"But, Lassiter, I would give freely--all I own to avert this--this\nwretched thing. If I gave--that would leave me with faith still. Surely\nmy--my churchmen think of my soul? If I lose my trust in them--\"\n\n\"Child, be still!\" said Lassiter, with a dark dignity that had in it\nsomething of pity. \"You are a woman, fine en' big an' strong, an' your\nheart matches your size. But in mind you're a child. I'll say a little\nmore--then I'm done. I'll never mention this again. Among many thousands\nof women you're one who has bucked against your churchmen. They tried\nyou out, an' failed of persuasion, an' finally of threats. You meet now\nthe cold steel of a will as far from Christlike as the universe is wide.\nYou're to be broken. Your body's to be held, given to some man, made,\nif possible, to bring children into the world. But your soul?... What do\nthey care for your soul?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. SOLITUDE AND STORM\n\nIn his hidden valley Venters awakened from sleep, and his ears rang\nwith innumerable melodies from full-throated mockingbirds, and his eyes\nopened wide upon the glorious golden shaft of sunlight shining through\nthe great stone bridge. The circle of cliffs surrounding Surprise Valley\nlay shrouded in morning mist, a dim blue low down along the terraces,\na creamy, moving cloud along the ramparts. The oak forest in the center\nwas a plumed and tufted oval of gold.\n\nHe saw Bess under the spruces. Upon her complete recovery of strength\nshe always rose with the dawn. At the moment she was feeding the\nquail she had tamed. And she had begun to tame the mocking-birds. They\nfluttered among the branches overhead and some left off their songs to\nflit down and shyly hop near the twittering quail. Little gray and white\nrabbits crouched in the grass, now nibbling, now laying long ears flat\nand watching the dogs.\n\nVenters's swift glance took in the brightening valley, and Bess and her\npets, and Ring and Whitie. It swept over all to return again and rest\nupon the girl. She had changed. To the dark trousers and blouse she had\nadded moccasins of her own make, but she no longer resembled a boy.\nNo eye could have failed to mark the rounded contours of a woman. The\nchange had been to grace and beauty. A glint of warm gold gleamed from\nher hair, and a tint of red shone in the clear dark brown of cheeks. The\nhaunting sweetness of her lips and eyes, that earlier had been illusive,\na promise, had become a living fact. She fitted harmoniously into that\nwonderful setting; she was like Surprise Valley--wild and beautiful.\n\nVenters leaped out of his cave to begin the day.\n\nHe had postponed his journey to Cottonwoods until after the passing of\nthe summer rains. The rains were due soon. But until their arrival and\nthe necessity for his trip to the village he sequestered in a far corner\nof mind all thought of peril, of his past life, and almost that of the\npresent. It was enough to live. He did not want to know what lay hidden\nin the dim and distant future. Surprise Valley had enchanted him. In\nthis home of the cliff-dwellers there were peace and quiet and solitude,\nand another thing, wondrous as the golden morning shaft of sunlight,\nthat he dared not ponder over long enough to understand.\n\nThe solitude he had hated when alone he had now come to love. He was\nassimilating something from this valley of gleams and shadows. From this\nstrange girl he was assimilating more.\n\nThe day at hand resembled many days gone before. As Venters had no tools\nwith which to build, or to till the terraces, he remained idle. Beyond\nthe cooking of the simple fare there were no tasks. And as there were no\ntasks, there was no system. He and Bess began one thing, to leave it;\nto begin another, to leave that; and then do nothing but lie under the\nspruces and watch the great cloud-sails majestically move along the\nramparts, and dream and dream. The valley was a golden, sunlit world.\nIt was silent. The sighing wind and the twittering quail and the singing\nbirds, even the rare and seldom-occurring hollow crack of a sliding\nweathered stone, only thickened and deepened that insulated silence.\n\nVenters and Bess had vagrant minds.\n\n\"Bess, did I tell you about my horse Wrangle?\" inquired Venters.\n\n\"A hundred times,\" she replied.\n\n\"Oh, have I? I'd forgotten. I want you to see him. He'll carry us both.\"\n\n\"I'd like to ride him. Can he run?\"\n\n\"Run? He's a demon. Swiftest horse on the sage! I hope he'll stay in\nthat canyon.\n\n\"He'll stay.\"\n\nThey left camp to wander along the terraces, into the aspen ravines,\nunder the gleaming walls. Ring and Whitie wandered in the fore, often\nturning, often trotting back, open-mouthed and solemn-eyed and happy.\nVenters lifted his gaze to the grand archway over the entrance to\nthe valley, and Bess lifted hers to follow his, and both were silent.\nSometimes the bridge held their attention for a long time. To-day a\nsoaring eagle attracted them.\n\n\"How he sails!\" exclaimed Bess. \"I wonder where his mate is?\"\n\n\"She's at the nest. It's on the bridge in a crack near the top. I see\nher often. She's almost white.\"\n\nThey wandered on down the terrace, into the shady, sun-flecked forest.\nA brown bird fluttered crying from a bush. Bess peeped into the leaves.\n\"Look! A nest and four little birds. They're not afraid of us. See how\nthey open their mouths. They're hungry.\"\n\nRabbits rustled the dead brush and pattered away. The forest was full\nof a drowsy hum of insects. Little darts of purple, that were running\nquail, crossed the glades. And a plaintive, sweet peeping came from the\ncoverts. Bess's soft step disturbed a sleeping lizard that scampered\naway over the leaves. She gave chase and caught it, a slim creature of\nnameless color but of exquisite beauty.\n\n\"Jewel eyes,\" she said. \"It's like a rabbit--afraid. We won't eat you.\nThere--go.\"\n\nMurmuring water drew their steps down into a shallow shaded ravine where\na brown brook brawled softly over mossy stones. Multitudes of strange,\ngray frogs with white spots and black eyes lined the rocky bank and\nleaped only at close approach. Then Venters's eye descried a very thin,\nvery long green snake coiled round a sapling. They drew closer and\ncloser till they could have touched it. The snake had no fear and\nwatched them with scintillating eyes.\n\n\"It's pretty,\" said Bess. \"How tame! I thought snakes always ran.\"\n\n\"No. Even the rabbits didn't run here till the dogs chased them.\"\n\nOn and on they wandered to the wild jumble of massed and broken\nfragments of cliff at the west end of the valley. The roar of the\ndisappearing stream dinned in their ears. Into this maze of rocks they\nthreaded a tortuous way, climbing, descending, halting to gather wild\nplums and great lavender lilies, and going on at the will of fancy. Idle\nand keen perceptions guided them equally.\n\n\"Oh, let us climb there!\" cried Bess, pointing upward to a small space\nof terrace left green and shady between huge abutments of broken cliff.\nAnd they climbed to the nook and rested and looked out across the valley\nto the curling column of blue smoke from their campfire. But the cool\nshade and the rich grass and the fine view were not what they had\nclimbed for. They could not have told, although whatever had drawn\nthem was well-satisfying. Light, sure-footed as a mountain goat, Bess\npattered down at Venters's heels; and they went on, calling the dogs,\neyes dreamy and wide, listening to the wind and the bees and the\ncrickets and the birds.\n\nPart of the time Ring and Whitie led the way, then Venters, then Bess;\nand the direction was not an object. They left the sun-streaked shade of\nthe oaks, brushed the long grass of the meadows, entered the green\nand fragrant swaying willows, to stop, at length, under the huge old\ncottonwoods where the beavers were busy.\n\nHere they rested and watched. A dam of brush and logs and mud and stones\nbacked the stream into a little lake. The round, rough beaver houses\nprojected from the water. Like the rabbits, the beavers had become shy.\nGradually, however, as Venters and Bess knelt low, holding the dogs, the\nbeavers emerged to swim with logs and gnaw at cottonwoods and pat mud\nwalls with their paddle-like tails, and, glossy and shiny in the sun, to\ngo on with their strange, persistent industry. They were the builders.\nThe lake was a mud-hole, and the immediate environment a scarred and\ndead region, but it was a wonderful home of wonderful animals.\n\n\"Look at that one--he puddles in the mud,\" said Bess. \"And there! See\nhim dive! Hear them gnawing! I'd think they'd break their teeth. How's\nit they can stay out of the water and under the water?\"\n\nAnd she laughed.\n\nThen Venters and Bess wandered farther, and, perhaps not all\nunconsciously this time, wended their slow steps to the cave of the\ncliff-dwellers, where she liked best to go.\n\nThe tangled thicket and the long slant of dust and little chips of\nweathered rock and the steep bench of stone and the worn steps all\nwere arduous work for Bess in the climbing. But she gained the shelf,\ngasping, hot of cheek, glad of eye, with her hand in Venters's. Here\nthey rested. The beautiful valley glittered below with its millions\nof wind-turned leaves bright-faced in the sun, and the mighty bridge\ntowered heavenward, crowned with blue sky. Bess, however, never rested\nfor long. Soon she was exploring, and Venters followed; she dragged\nforth from corners and shelves a multitude of crudely fashioned and\npainted pieces of pottery, and he carried them. They peeped down into\nthe dark holes of the kivas, and Bess gleefully dropped a stone and\nwaited for the long-coming hollow sound to rise. They peeped into the\nlittle globular houses, like mud-wasp nests, and wondered if these had\nbeen store-places for grain, or baby cribs, or what; and they crawled\ninto the larger houses and laughed when they bumped their heads on the\nlow roofs, and they dug in the dust of the floors. And they brought from\ndust and darkness armloads of treasure which they carried to the light.\nFlints and stones and strange curved sticks and pottery they found; and\ntwisted grass rope that crumbled in their hands, and bits of whitish\nstone which crushed to powder at a touch and seemed to vanish in the\nair.\n\n\"That white stuff was bone,\" said Venters, slowly. \"Bones of a\ncliff-dweller.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Bess.\n\n\"Here's another piece. Look!... Whew! dry, powdery smoke! That's bone.\"\n\nThen it was that Venters's primitive, childlike mood, like a savage's,\nseeing, yet unthinking, gave way to the encroachment of civilized\nthought. The world had not been made for a single day's play or fancy or\nidle watching. The world was old. Nowhere could be gotten a better\nidea of its age than in this gigantic silent tomb. The gray ashes in\nVenters's hand had once been bone of a human being like himself. The\npale gloom of the cave had shadowed people long ago. He saw that Bess\nhad received the same shock--could not in moments such as this escape\nher feeling living, thinking destiny.\n\n\"Bern, people have lived here,\" she said, with wide, thoughtful eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied.\n\n\"How long ago?\"\n\n\"A thousand years and more.\"\n\n\"What were they?\"\n\n\"Cliff-dwellers. Men who had enemies and made their homes high out of\nreach.\"\n\n\"They had to fight?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"They fought for--what?\"\n\n\"For life. For their homes, food, children, parents--for their women!\"\n\n\"Has the world changed any in a thousand years?\"\n\n\"I don't know--perhaps a little.\"\n\n\"Have men?\"\n\n\"I hope so--I think so.\"\n\n\"Things crowd into my mind,\" she went on, and the wistful light in her\neyes told Venters the truth of her thoughts. \"I've ridden the border of\nUtah. I've seen people--know how they live--but they must be few of all\nwho are living. I had my books and I studied them. But all that doesn't\nhelp me any more. I want to go out into the big world and see it. Yet I\nwant to stay here more. What's to become of us? Are we cliff-dwellers?\nWe're alone here. I'm happy when I don't think. These--these bones that\nfly into dust--they make me sick and a little afraid. Did the people who\nlived here once have the same feelings as we have? What was the good of\ntheir living at all? They're gone! What's the meaning of it all--of us?\"\n\n\"Bess, you ask more than I can tell. It's beyond me. Only there was\nlaughter here once--and now there's silence. There was life--and now\nthere's death. Men cut these little steps, made these arrow-heads and\nmealing-stones, plaited the ropes we found, and left their bones to\ncrumble in our fingers. As far as time is concerned it might all have\nbeen yesterday. We're here to-day. Maybe we're higher in the scale of\nhuman beings--in intelligence. But who knows? We can't be any higher in\nthe things for which life is lived at all.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Why--I suppose relationship, friendship--love.\"\n\n\"Love!\"\n\n\"Yes. Love of man for woman--love of woman for man. That's the nature,\nthe meaning, the best of life itself.\"\n\nShe said no more. Wistfulness of glance deepened into sadness.\n\n\"Come, let us go,\" said Venters.\n\nAction brightened her. Beside him, holding his hand she slipped down\nthe shelf, ran down the long, steep slant of sliding stones, out of the\ncloud of dust, and likewise out of the pale gloom.\n\n\"We beat the slide,\" she cried.\n\nThe miniature avalanche cracked and roared, and rattled itself into an\ninert mass at the base of the incline. Yellow dust like the gloom of the\ncave, but not so changeless, drifted away on the wind; the roar clapped\nin echo from the cliff, returned, went back, and came again to die\nin the hollowness. Down on the sunny terrace there was a different\natmosphere. Ring and Whitie leaped around Bess. Once more she was\nsmiling, gay, and thoughtless, with the dream-mood in the shadow of her\neyes.\n\n\"Bess, I haven't seen that since last summer. Look!\" said Venters,\npointing to the scalloped edge of rolling purple clouds that peeped over\nthe western wall. \"We're in for a storm.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope not. I'm afraid of storms.\"\n\n\"Are you? Why?\"\n\n\"Have you ever been down in one of these walled-up pockets in a bad\nstorm?\"\n\n\"No, now I think of it, I haven't.\"\n\n\"Well, it's terrible. Every summer I get scared to death and hide\nsomewhere in the dark. Storms up on the sage are bad, but nothing to\nwhat they are down here in the canyons. And in this little valley--why,\nechoes can rap back and forth so quick they'll split our ears.\"\n\n\"We're perfectly safe here, Bess.\"\n\n\"I know. But that hasn't anything to do with it. The truth is I'm afraid\nof lightning and thunder, and thunder-claps hurt my head. If we have a\nbad storm, will you stay close to me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWhen they got back to camp the afternoon was closing, and it was\nexceedingly sultry. Not a breath of air stirred the aspen leaves, and\nwhen these did not quiver the air was indeed still. The dark-purple\nclouds moved almost imperceptibly out of the west.\n\n\"What have we for supper?\" asked Bess.\n\n\"Rabbit.\"\n\n\"Bern, can't you think of another new way to cook rabbit?\" went on Bess,\nwith earnestness.\n\n\"What do you think I am--a magician?\" retorted Venters.\n\n\"I wouldn't dare tell you. But, Bern, do you want me to turn into a\nrabbit?\"\n\nThere was a dark-blue, merry flashing of eyes and a parting of lips;\nthen she laughed. In that moment she was naive and wholesome.\n\n\"Rabbit seems to agree with you,\" replied Venters. \"You are well and\nstrong--and growing very pretty.\"\n\nAnything in the nature of compliment he had never before said to her,\nand just now he responded to a sudden curiosity to see its effect. Bess\nstared as if she had not heard aright, slowly blushed, and completely\nlost her poise in happy confusion.\n\n\"I'd better go right away,\" he continued, \"and fetch supplies from\nCottonwoods.\"\n\nA startlingly swift change in the nature of her agitation made him\nreproach himself for his abruptness.\n\n\"No, no, don't go!\" she said. \"I didn't mean--that about the rabbit.\nI--I was only trying to be--funny. Don't leave me all alone!\"\n\n\"Bess, I must go sometime.\"\n\n\"Wait then. Wait till after the storms.\"\n\nThe purple cloud-bank darkened the lower edge of the setting sun, crept\nup and up, obscuring its fiery red heart, and finally passed over the\nlast ruddy crescent of its upper rim.\n\nThe intense dead silence awakened to a long, low, rumbling roll of\nthunder.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Bess, nervously.\n\n\"We've had big black clouds before this without rain,\" said Venters.\n\"But there's no doubt about that thunder. The storms are coming. I'm\nglad. Every rider on the sage will hear that thunder with glad ears.\"\n\nVenters and Bess finished their simple meal and the few tasks around the\ncamp, then faced the open terrace, the valley, and the west, to watch\nand await the approaching storm.\n\nIt required keen vision to see any movement whatever in the purple\nclouds. By infinitesimal degrees the dark cloud-line merged upward into\nthe golden-red haze of the afterglow of sunset. A shadow lengthened from\nunder the western wall across the valley. As straight and rigid as steel\nrose the delicate spear-pointed silver spruces; the aspen leaves, by\nnature pendant and quivering, hung limp and heavy; no slender blade\nof grass moved. A gentle splashing of water came from the ravine. Then\nagain from out of the west sounded the low, dull, and rumbling roll of\nthunder.\n\nA wave, a ripple of light, a trembling and turning of the aspen leaves,\nlike the approach of a breeze on the water, crossed the valley from the\nwest; and the lull and the deadly stillness and the sultry air passed\naway on a cool wind.\n\nThe night bird of the canyon, with clear and melancholy notes announced\nthe twilight. And from all along the cliffs rose the faint murmur and\nmoan and mourn of the wind singing in the caves. The bank of clouds now\nswept hugely out of the western sky. Its front was purple and black,\nwith gray between, a bulging, mushrooming, vast thing instinct with\nstorm. It had a dark, angry, threatening aspect. As if all the power of\nthe winds were pushing and piling behind, it rolled ponderously across\nthe sky. A red flare burned out instantaneously, flashed from the west\nto east, and died. Then from the deepest black of the purple cloud burst\na boom. It was like the bowling of a huge boulder along the crags and\nramparts, and seemed to roll on and fall into the valley to bound and\nbang and boom from cliff to cliff.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Bess, with her hands over her ears. \"What did I tell you?\"\n\n\"Why, Bess, be reasonable!\" said Venters.\n\n\"I'm a coward.\"\n\n\"Not quite that, I hope. It's strange you're afraid. I love a storm.\"\n\n\"I tell you a storm down in these canyons is an awful thing. I know\nOldring hated storms. His men were afraid of them. There was one who\nwent deaf in a bad storm, and never could hear again.\"\n\n\"Maybe I've lots to learn, Bess. I'll lose my guess if this storm isn't\nbad enough. We're going to have heavy wind first, then lightning and\nthunder, then the rain. Let's stay out as long as we can.\"\n\nThe tips of the cottonwoods and the oaks waved to the east, and the\nrings of aspens along the terraces twinkled their myriad of bright faces\nin fleet and glancing gleam. A low roar rose from the leaves of the\nforest, and the spruces swished in the rising wind. It came in gusts,\nwith light breezes between. As it increased in strength the lulls\nshortened in length till there was a strong and steady blow all the\ntime, and violent puffs at intervals, and sudden whirling currents. The\nclouds spread over the valley, rolling swiftly and low, and twilight\nfaded into a sweeping darkness. Then the singing of the wind in the\ncaves drowned the swift roar of rustling leaves; then the song swelled\nto a mourning, moaning wail; then with the gathering power of the\nwind the wail changed to a shriek. Steadily the wind strengthened and\nconstantly the strange sound changed.\n\nThe last bit of blue sky yielded to the on-sweep of clouds. Like angry\nsurf the pale gleams of gray, amid the purple of that scudding front,\nswept beyond the eastern rampart of the valley. The purple deepened to\nblack. Broad sheets of lightning flared over the western wall. There\nwere not yet any ropes or zigzag streaks darting down through the\ngathering darkness. The storm center was still beyond Surprise Valley.\n\n\"Listen!... Listen!\" cried Bess, with her lips close to Venters's ear.\n\"You'll hear Oldring's knell!\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Oldring's knell. When the wind blows a gale in the caves it makes what\nthe rustlers call Oldring's knell. They believe it bodes his death.\nI think he believes so, too. It's not like any sound on earth.... It's\nbeginning. Listen!\"\n\nThe gale swooped down with a hollow unearthly howl. It yelled and pealed\nand shrilled and shrieked. It was made up of a thousand piercing cries.\nIt was a rising and a moving sound. Beginning at the western break of\nthe valley, it rushed along each gigantic cliff, whistling into the\ncaves and cracks, to mount in power, to bellow a blast through the great\nstone bridge. Gone, as into an engulfing roar of surging waters, it\nseemed to shoot back and begin all over again.\n\nIt was only wind, thought Venters. Here sped and shrieked the sculptor\nthat carved out the wonderful caves in the cliffs. It was only a gale,\nbut as Venters listened, as his ears became accustomed to the fury and\nstrife, out of it all or through it or above it pealed low and perfectly\nclear and persistently uniform a strange sound that had no counterpart\nin all the sounds of the elements. It was not of earth or of life. It\nwas the grief and agony of the gale. A knell of all upon which it blew!\n\nBlack night enfolded the valley. Venters could not see his companion,\nand knew of her presence only through the tightening hold of her hand\non his arm. He felt the dogs huddle closer to him. Suddenly the dense,\nblack vault overhead split asunder to a blue-white, dazzling streak of\nlightning. The whole valley lay vividly clear and luminously bright in\nhis sight. Upreared, vast and magnificent, the stone bridge glimmered\nlike some grand god of storm in the lightning's fire. Then all flashed\nblack again--blacker than pitch--a thick, impenetrable coal-blackness.\nAnd there came a ripping, crashing report. Instantly an echo resounded\nwith clapping crash. The initial report was nothing to the echo. It was\na terrible, living, reverberating, detonating crash. The wall threw the\nsound across, and could have made no greater roar if it had slipped\nin avalanche. From cliff to cliff the echo went in crashing retort and\nbanged in lessening power, and boomed in thinner volume, and clapped\nweaker and weaker till a final clap could not reach across the waiting\ncliff.\n\nIn the pitchy darkness Venters led Bess, and, groping his way, by feel\nof hand found the entrance to her cave and lifted her up. On the instant\na blinding flash of lightning illumined the cave and all about him. He\nsaw Bess's face white now with dark, frightened eyes. He saw the dogs\nleap up, and he followed suit. The golden glare vanished; all was black;\nthen came the splitting crack and the infernal din of echoes.\n\nBess shrank closer to him and closer, found his hands, and pressed them\ntightly over her ears, and dropped her face upon his shoulder, and hid\nher eyes.\n\nThen the storm burst with a succession of ropes and streaks and shafts\nof lightning, playing continuously, filling the valley with a broken\nradiance; and the cracking shots followed each other swiftly till the\nechoes blended in one fearful, deafening crash.\n\nVenters looked out upon the beautiful valley--beautiful now as never\nbefore--mystic in its transparent, luminous gloom, weird in the\nquivering, golden haze of lightning. The dark spruces were tipped with\nglimmering lights; the aspens bent low in the winds, as waves in a\ntempest at sea; the forest of oaks tossed wildly and shone with gleams\nof fire. Across the valley the huge cavern of the cliff-dwellers yawned\nin the glare, every little black window as clear as at noonday; but the\nnight and the storm added to their tragedy. Flung arching to the black\nclouds, the great stone bridge seemed to bear the brunt of the storm. It\ncaught the full fury of the rushing wind. It lifted its noble crown to\nmeet the lightnings. Venters thought of the eagles and their lofty nest\nin a niche under the arch. A driving pall of rain, black as the clouds,\ncame sweeping on to obscure the bridge and the gleaming walls and the\nshining valley. The lightning played incessantly, streaking down through\nopaque darkness of rain. The roar of the wind, with its strange knell\nand the re-crashing echoes, mingled with the roar of the flooding rain,\nand all seemingly were deadened and drowned in a world of sound.\n\nIn the dimming pale light Venters looked down upon the girl. She had\nsunk into his arms, upon his breast, burying her face. She clung to him.\nHe felt the softness of her, and the warmth, and the quick heave of her\nbreast. He saw the dark, slender, graceful outline of her form. A woman\nlay in his arms! And he held her closer. He who had been alone in the\nsad, silent watches of the night was not now and never must be again\nalone. He who had yearned for the touch of a hand felt the long tremble\nand the heart-beat of a woman. By what strange chance had she come to\nlove him! By what change--by what marvel had she grown into a treasure!\n\nNo more did he listen to the rush and roar of the thunder-storm.\nFor with the touch of clinging hands and the throbbing bosom he grew\nconscious of an inward storm--the tingling of new chords of thought,\nstrange music of unheard, joyous bells sad dreams dawning to wakeful\ndelight, dissolving doubt, resurging hope, force, fire, and freedom,\nunutterable sweetness of desire. A storm in his breast--a storm of real\nlove.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. WEST WIND\n\nWhen the storm abated Venters sought his own cave, and late in the\nnight, as his blood cooled and the stir and throb and thrill subsided,\nhe fell asleep.\n\nWith the breaking of dawn his eyes unclosed. The valley lay drenched\nand bathed, a burnished oval of glittering green. The rain-washed walls\nglistened in the morning light. Waterfalls of many forms poured over\nthe rims. One, a broad, lacy sheet, thin as smoke, slid over the western\nnotch and struck a ledge in its downward fall, to bound into broader\nleap, to burst far below into white and gold and rosy mist.\n\nVenters prepared for the day, knowing himself a different man.\n\n\"It's a glorious morning,\" said Bess, in greeting.\n\n\"Yes. After the storm the west wind,\" he replied.\n\n\"Last night was I--very much of a baby?\" she asked, watching him.\n\n\"Pretty much.\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't help it!\"\n\n\"I'm glad you were afraid.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked, in slow surprise.\n\n\"I'll tell you some day,\" he answered, soberly. Then around the\ncamp-fire and through the morning meal he was silent; afterward he\nstrolled thoughtfully off alone along the terrace. He climbed a great\nyellow rock raising its crest among the spruces, and there he sat down\nto face the valley and the west.\n\n\"I love her!\"\n\nAloud he spoke--unburdened his heart--confessed his secret. For an\ninstant the golden valley swam before his eyes, and the walls waved, and\nall about him whirled with tumult within.\n\n\"I love her!... I understand now.\"\n\nReviving memory of Jane Withersteen and thought of the complications of\nthe present amazed him with proof of how far he had drifted from his\nold life. He discovered that he hated to take up the broken threads, to\ndelve into dark problems and difficulties. In this beautiful valley he\nhad been living a beautiful dream. Tranquillity had come to him, and the\njoy of solitude, and interest in all the wild creatures and crannies of\nthis incomparable valley--and love. Under the shadow of the great stone\nbridge God had revealed Himself to Venters.\n\n\"The world seems very far away,\" he muttered, \"but it's there--and I'm\nnot yet done with it. Perhaps I never shall be.... Only--how glorious it\nwould be to live here always and never think again!\"\n\nWhereupon the resurging reality of the present, as if in irony of his\nwish, steeped him instantly in contending thought. Out of it all he\npresently evolved these things: he must go to Cottonwoods; he must bring\nsupplies back to Surprise Valley; he must cultivate the soil and raise\ncorn and stock, and, most imperative of all, he must decide the future\nof the girl who loved him and whom he loved. The first of these things\nrequired tremendous effort, the last one, concerning Bess, seemed simply\nand naturally easy of accomplishment. He would marry her. Suddenly, as\nfrom roots of poisonous fire, flamed up the forgotten truth concerning\nher. It seemed to wither and shrivel up all his joy on its hot, tearing\nway to his heart. She had been Oldring's Masked Rider. To Venters's\nquestion, \"What were you to Oldring?\" she had answered with scarlet\nshame and drooping head.\n\n\"What do I care who she is or what she was!\" he cried, passionately. And\nhe knew it was not his old self speaking. It was this softer, gentler\nman who had awakened to new thoughts in the quiet valley. Tenderness,\nmasterful in him now, matched the absence of joy and blunted the\nknife-edge of entering jealousy. Strong and passionate effort of will,\nsurprising to him, held back the poison from piercing his soul.\n\n\"Wait!... Wait!\" he cried, as if calling. His hand pressed his breast,\nand he might have called to the pang there. \"Wait! It's all so\nstrange--so wonderful. Anything can happen. Who am I to judge her? I'll\nglory in my love for her. But I can't tell it--can't give up to it.\"\n\nCertainly he could not then decide her future. Marrying her was\nimpossible in Surprise Valley and in any village south of Sterling. Even\nwithout the mask she had once worn she would easily have been recognized\nas Oldring's Rider. No man who had ever seen her would forget her,\nregardless of his ignorance as to her sex. Then more poignant than all\nother argument was the fact that he did not want to take her away from\nSurprise Valley. He resisted all thought of that. He had brought her to\nthe most beautiful and wildest place of the uplands; he had saved her,\nnursed her back to strength, watched her bloom as one of the valley\nlilies; he knew her life there to be pure and sweet--she belonged to\nhim, and he loved her. Still these were not all the reasons why he\ndid not want to take her away. Where could they go? He feared the\nrustlers--he feared the riders--he feared the Mormons. And if he should\never succeed in getting Bess safely away from these immediate perils, he\nfeared the sharp eyes of women and their tongues, the big outside world\nwith its problems of existence. He must wait to decide her future,\nwhich, after all, was deciding his own. But between her future and his\nsomething hung impending. Like Balancing Rock, which waited darkly over\nthe steep gorge, ready to close forever the outlet to Deception Pass,\nthat nameless thing, as certain yet intangible as fate, must fall and\nclose forever all doubts and fears of the future.\n\n\"I've dreamed,\" muttered Venters, as he rose. \"Well, why not?... To dream\nis happiness! But let me just once see this clearly wholly; then I can\ngo on dreaming till the thing falls. I've got to tell Jane Withersteen.\nI've dangerous trips to take. I've work here to make comfort for this\ngirl. She's mine. I'll fight to keep her safe from that old life. I've\nalready seen her forget it. I love her. And if a beast ever rises in me\nI'll burn my hand off before I lay it on her with shameful intent. And,\nby God! sooner or later I'll kill the man who hid her and kept her in\nDeception Pass!\"\n\nAs he spoke the west wind softly blew in his face. It seemed to soothe\nhis passion. That west wind was fresh, cool, fragrant, and it carried\na sweet, strange burden of far-off things--tidings of life in other\nclimes, of sunshine asleep on other walls--of other places where reigned\npeace. It carried, too, sad truth of human hearts and mystery--of\npromise and hope unquenchable. Surprise Valley was only a little niche\nin the wide world whence blew that burdened wind. Bess was only one of\nmillions at the mercy of unknown motive in nature and life. Content had\ncome to Venters in the valley; happiness had breathed in the slow, warm\nair; love as bright as light had hovered over the walls and descended to\nhim; and now on the west wind came a whisper of the eternal triumph of\nfaith over doubt.\n\n\"How much better I am for what has come to me!\" he exclaimed. \"I'll let\nthe future take care of itself. Whatever falls, I'll be ready.\"\n\nVenters retraced his steps along the terrace back to camp, and found\nBess in the old familiar seat, waiting and watching for his return.\n\n\"I went off by myself to think a little,\" he explained.\n\n\"You never looked that way before. What--what is it? Won't you tell me?\"\n\n\"Well, Bess, the fact is I've been dreaming a lot. This valley makes a\nfellow dream. So I forced myself to think. We can't live this way much\nlonger. Soon I'll simply have to go to Cottonwoods. We need a whole pack\ntrain of supplies. I can get--\"\n\n\"Can you go safely?\" she interrupted.\n\n\"Why, I'm sure of it. I'll ride through the Pass at night. I haven't any\nfear that Wrangle isn't where I left him. And once on him--Bess, just\nwait till you see that horse!\"\n\n\"Oh, I want to see him--to ride him. But--but, Bern, this is what\ntroubles me,\" she said. \"Will--will you come back?\"\n\n\"Give me four days. If I'm not back in four days you'll know I'm dead.\nFor that only shall keep me.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Bess, I'll come back. There's danger--I wouldn't lie to you--but I can\ntake care of myself.\"\n\n\"Bern, I'm sure--oh, I'm sure of it! All my life I've watched hunted\nmen. I can tell what's in them. And I believe you can ride and shoot and\nsee with any rider of the sage. It's not--not that I--fear.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it, then?\"\n\n\"Why--why--why should you come back at all?\"\n\n\"I couldn't leave you here alone.\"\n\n\"You might change your mind when you get to the village--among old\nfriends--\"\n\n\"I won't change my mind. As for old friends--\" He uttered a short,\nexpressive laugh.\n\n\"Then--there--there must be a--a woman!\" Dark red mantled the clear tan\nof temple and cheek and neck. Her eyes were eyes of shame, upheld a long\nmoment by intense, straining search for the verification of her fear.\nSuddenly they drooped, her head fell to her knees, her hands flew to her\nhot cheeks.\n\n\"Bess--look here,\" said Venters, with a sharpness due to the violence\nwith which he checked his quick, surging emotion.\n\nAs if compelled against her will--answering to an irresistible\nvoice--Bess raised her head, looked at him with sad, dark eyes, and\ntried to whisper with tremulous lips.\n\n\"There's no woman,\" went on Venters, deliberately holding her glance\nwith his. \"Nothing on earth, barring the chances of life, can keep me\naway.\"\n\nHer face flashed and flushed with the glow of a leaping joy; but like\nthe vanishing of a gleam it disappeared to leave her as he had never\nbeheld her.\n\n\"I am nothing--I am lost--I am nameless!\"\n\n\"Do you want me to come back?\" he asked, with sudden stern coldness.\n\"Maybe you want to go back to Oldring!\"\n\nThat brought her erect, trembling and ashy pale, with dark, proud eyes\nand mute lips refuting his insinuation.\n\n\"Bess, I beg your pardon. I shouldn't have said that. But you angered\nme. I intend to work--to make a home for you here--to be a--a brother\nto you as long as ever you need me. And you must forget what you\nare--were--I mean, and be happy. When you remember that old life you are\nbitter, and it hurts me.\"\n\n\"I was happy--I shall be very happy. Oh, you're so good that--that it\nkills me! If I think, I can't believe it. I grow sick with wondering\nwhy. I'm only a let me say it--only a lost, nameless--girl of the\nrustlers. Oldring's Girl, they called me. That you should save me--be so\ngood and kind--want to make me happy--why, it's beyond belief. No wonder\nI'm wretched at the thought of your leaving me. But I'll be wretched\nand bitter no more. I promise you. If only I could repay you even a\nlittle--\"\n\n\"You've repaid me a hundredfold. Will you believe me?\"\n\n\"Believe you! I couldn't do else.\"\n\n\"Then listen!... Saving you, I saved myself. Living here in this valley\nwith you, I've found myself. I've learned to think while I was dreaming.\nI never troubled myself about God. But God, or some wonderful spirit,\nhas whispered to me here. I absolutely deny the truth of what you say\nabout yourself. I can't explain it. There are things too deep to tell.\nWhatever the terrible wrongs you've suffered, God holds you blameless.\nI see that--feel that in you every moment you are near me. I've a\nmother and a sister 'way back in Illinois. If I could I'd take you to\nthem--to-morrow.\"\n\n\"If it were true! Oh, I might--I might lift my head!\" she cried.\n\n\"Lift it then--you child. For I swear it's true.\"\n\nShe did lift her head with the singular wild grace always a part of her\nactions, with that old unconscious intimation of innocence which always\ntortured Venters, but now with something more--a spirit rising from the\ndepths that linked itself to his brave words.\n\n\"I've been thinking--too,\" she cried, with quivering smile and swelling\nbreast. \"I've discovered myself--too. I'm young--I'm alive--I'm so\nfull--oh! I'm a woman!\"\n\n\"Bess, I believe I can claim credit of that last discovery--before you,\"\nVenters said, and laughed.\n\n\"Oh, there's more--there's something I must tell you.\"\n\n\"Tell it, then.\"\n\n\"When will you go to Cottonwoods?\"\n\n\"As soon as the storms are past, or the worst of them.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you before you go. I can't now. I don't know how I shall\nthen. But it must be told. I'd never let you leave me without knowing.\nFor in spite of what you say there's a chance you mightn't come back.\"\n\nDay after day the west wind blew across the valley. Day after day the\nclouds clustered gray and purple and black. The cliffs sang and the\ncaves rang with Oldring's knell, and the lightning flashed, the thunder\nrolled, the echoes crashed and crashed, and the rains flooded the\nvalley. Wild flowers sprang up everywhere, swaying with the lengthening\ngrass on the terraces, smiling wanly from shady nooks, peeping\nwondrously from year-dry crevices of the walls. The valley bloomed\ninto a paradise. Every single moment, from the breaking of the gold bar\nthrough the bridge at dawn on to the reddening of rays over the western\nwall, was one of colorful change. The valley swam in thick, transparent\nhaze, golden at dawn, warm and white at noon, purple in the twilight. At\nthe end of every storm a rainbow curved down into the leaf-bright forest\nto shine and fade and leave lingeringly some faint essence of its rosy\niris in the air.\n\nVenters walked with Bess, once more in a dream, and watched the lights\nchange on the walls, and faced the wind from out of the west.\n\nAlways it brought softly to him strange, sweet tidings of far-off\nthings. It blew from a place that was old and whispered of youth. It\nblew down the grooves of time. It brought a story of the passing hours.\nIt breathed low of fighting men and praying women. It sang clearly the\nsong of love. That ever was the burden of its tidings--youth in the\nshady woods, waders through the wet meadows, boy and girl at the\nhedgerow stile, bathers in the booming surf, sweet, idle hours on\ngrassy, windy hills, long strolls down moonlit lanes--everywhere in\nfar-off lands, fingers locked and bursting hearts and longing lips--from\nall the world tidings of unquenchable love.\n\nOften, in these hours of dreams he watched the girl, and asked himself\nof what was she dreaming? For the changing light of the valley reflected\nits gleam and its color and its meaning in the changing light of her\neyes. He saw in them infinitely more than he saw in his dreams. He saw\nthought and soul and nature--strong vision of life. All tidings the west\nwind blew from distance and age he found deep in those dark-blue depths,\nand found them mysteries solved. Under their wistful shadow he softened,\nand in the softening felt himself grow a sadder, a wiser, and a better\nman.\n\nWhile the west wind blew its tidings, filling his heart full, teaching\nhim a man's part, the days passed, the purple clouds changed to white,\nand the storms were over for that summer.\n\n\"I must go now,\" he said.\n\n\"When?\" she asked.\n\n\"At once--to-night.\"\n\n\"I'm glad the time has come. It dragged at me. Go--for you'll come back\nthe sooner.\"\n\nLate in the afternoon, as the ruddy sun split its last flame in the\nragged notch of the western wall, Bess walked with Venters along the\neastern terrace, up the long, weathered slope, under the great stone\nbridge. They entered the narrow gorge to climb around the fence long\nbefore built there by Venters. Farther than this she had never been.\nTwilight had already fallen in the gorge. It brightened to waning shadow\nin the wider ascent. He showed her Balancing Rock, of which he had\noften told her, and explained its sinister leaning over the outlet.\nShuddering, she looked down the long, pale incline with its closed-in,\ntoppling walls.\n\n\"What an awful trail! Did you carry me up here?\"\n\n\"I did, surely,\" replied he.\n\n\"It frightens me, somehow. Yet I never was afraid of trails. I'd ride\nanywhere a horse could go, and climb where he couldn't. But there's\nsomething fearful here. I feel as--as if the place was watching me.\"\n\n\"Look at this rock. It's balanced here--balanced perfectly. You know I\ntold you the cliff-dwellers cut the rock, and why. But they're gone and\nthe rock waits. Can't you see--feel how it waits here? I moved it once,\nand I'll never dare again. A strong heave would start it. Then it would\nfall and bang, and smash that crag, and jar the walls, and close forever\nthe outlet to Deception Pass!\"\n\n\"Ah! When you come back I'll steal up here and push and push with all\nmy might to roll the rock and close forever the outlet to the Pass!\"\nShe said it lightly, but in the undercurrent of her voice was a heavier\nnote, a ring deeper than any ever given mere play of words.\n\n\"Bess!... You can't dare me! Wait till I come back with supplies--then\nroll the stone.\"\n\n\"I--was--in--fun.\" Her voice now throbbed low. \"Always you must be free\nto go when you will. Go now... this place presses on me--stifles me.\"\n\n\"I'm going--but you had something to tell me?\"\n\n\"Yes.... Will you--come back?\"\n\n\"I'll come if I live.\"\n\n\"But--but you mightn't come?\"\n\n\"That's possible, of course. It'll take a good deal to kill me. A man\ncouldn't have a faster horse or keener dog. And, Bess, I've guns, and\nI'll use them if I'm pushed. But don't worry.\"\n\n\"I've faith in you. I'll not worry until after four days. Only--because\nyou mightn't come--I must tell you--\"\n\nShe lost her voice. Her pale face, her great, glowing, earnest eyes,\nseemed to stand alone out of the gloom of the gorge. The dog whined,\nbreaking the silence.\n\n\"I must tell you--because you mightn't come back,\" she whispered. \"You\nmust know what--what I think of your goodness--of you. Always I've been\ntongue-tied. I seemed not to be grateful. It was deep in my heart.\nEven now--if I were other than I am--I couldn't tell you. But I'm\nnothing--only a rustler's girl--nameless--infamous. You've saved me--and\nI'm--I'm yours to do with as you like.... With all my heart and soul--I\nlove you!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. SHADOWS ON THE SAGE-SLOPE\n\nIn the cloudy, threatening, waning summer days shadows lengthened\ndown the sage-slope, and Jane Withersteen likened them to the shadows\ngathering and closing in around her life.\n\nMrs. Larkin died, and little Fay was left an orphan with no known\nrelative. Jane's love redoubled. It was the saving brightness of a\ndarkening hour. Fay turned now to Jane in childish worship. And Jane\nat last found full expression for the mother-longing in her heart. Upon\nLassiter, too, Mrs. Larkin's death had some subtle reaction. Before,\nhe had often, without explanation, advised Jane to send Fay back to any\nGentile family that would take her in. Passionately and reproachfully\nand wonderingly Jane had refused even to entertain such an idea. And\nnow Lassiter never advised it again, grew sadder and quieter in his\ncontemplation of the child, and infinitely more gentle and loving.\nSometimes Jane had a cold, inexplicable sensation of dread when she saw\nLassiter watching Fay. What did the rider see in the future? Why did he,\nday by day, grow more silent, calmer, cooler, yet sadder in prophetic\nassurance of something to be?\n\nNo doubt, Jane thought, the rider, in his almost superhuman power of\nforesight, saw behind the horizon the dark, lengthening shadows that\nwere soon to crowd and gloom over him and her and little Fay. Jane\nWithersteen awaited the long-deferred breaking of the storm with a\ncourage and embittered calm that had come to her in her extremity. Hope\nhad not died. Doubt and fear, subservient to her will, no longer gave\nher sleepless nights and tortured days. Love remained. All that she had\nloved she now loved the more. She seemed to feel that she was defiantly\nflinging the wealth of her love in the face of misfortune and of\nhate. No day passed but she prayed for all--and most fervently for her\nenemies. It troubled her that she had lost, or had never gained,\nthe whole control of her mind. In some measure reason and wisdom and\ndecision were locked in a chamber of her brain, awaiting a key. Power\nto think of some things was taken from her. Meanwhile, abiding a day of\njudgment, she fought ceaselessly to deny the bitter drops in her cup,\nto tear back the slow, the intangibly slow growth of a hot, corrosive\nlichen eating into her heart.\n\nOn the morning of August 10th, Jane, while waiting in the court for\nLassiter, heard a clear, ringing report of a rifle. It came from the\ngrove, somewhere toward the corrals. Jane glanced out in alarm. The day\nwas dull, windless, soundless. The leaves of the cottonwoods drooped, as\nif they had foretold the doom of Withersteen House and were now ready to\ndie and drop and decay. Never had Jane seen such shade. She pondered\non the meaning of the report. Revolver shots had of late cracked from\ndifferent parts of the grove--spies taking snap-shots at Lassiter from\na cowardly distance! But a rifle report meant more. Riders seldom used\nrifles. Judkins and Venters were the exceptions she called to mind. Had\nthe men who hounded her hidden in her grove, taken to the rifle to rid\nher of Lassiter, her last friend? It was probable--it was likely. And\nshe did not share his cool assumption that his death would never come at\nthe hands of a Mormon. Long had she expected it. His constancy to\nher, his singular reluctance to use the fatal skill for which he was\nfamed--both now plain to all Mormons--laid him open to inevitable\nassassination. Yet what charm against ambush and aim and enemy he\nseemed to bear about him! No, Jane reflected, it was not charm; only\na wonderful training of eye and ear, and sense of impending peril.\nNevertheless that could not forever avail against secret attack.\n\nThat moment a rustling of leaves attracted her attention; then the\nfamiliar clinking accompaniment of a slow, soft, measured step, and\nLassiter walked into the court.\n\n\"Jane, there's a fellow out there with a long gun,\" he said, and,\nremoving his sombrero, showed his head bound in a bloody scarf.\n\n\"I heard the shot; I knew it was meant for you. Let me see--you can't be\nbadly injured?\"\n\n\"I reckon not. But mebbe it wasn't a close call!... I'll sit here in this\ncorner where nobody can see me from the grove.\" He untied the scarf and\nremoved it to show a long, bleeding furrow above his left temple.\n\n\"It's only a cut,\" said Jane. \"But how it bleeds! Hold your scarf over\nit just a moment till I come back.\"\n\nShe ran into the house and returned with bandages; and while she bathed\nand dressed the wound Lassiter talked.\n\n\"That fellow had a good chance to get me. But he must have flinched when\nhe pulled the trigger. As I dodged down I saw him run through the trees.\nHe had a rifle. I've been expectin' that kind of gun play. I reckon now\nI'll have to keep a little closer hid myself. These fellers all seem to\nget chilly or shaky when they draw a bead on me, but one of them might\njest happen to hit me.\"\n\n\"Won't you go away--leave Cottonwoods as I've begged you to--before some\none does happen to hit you?\" she appealed to him.\n\n\"I reckon I'll stay.\"\n\n\"But, oh, Lassiter--your blood will be on my hands!\"\n\n\"See here, lady, look at your hands now, right now. Aren't they fine,\nfirm, white hands? Aren't they bloody now? Lassiter's blood! That's a\nqueer thing to stain your beautiful hands. But if you could only see\ndeeper you'd find a redder color of blood. Heart color, Jane!\"\n\n\"Oh!... My friend!\"\n\n\"No, Jane, I'm not one to quit when the game grows hot, no more than\nyou. This game, though, is new to me, an' I don't know the moves yet,\nelse I wouldn't have stepped in front of that bullet.\"\n\n\"Have you no desire to hunt the man who fired at you--to find\nhim--and--and kill him?\"\n\n\"Well, I reckon I haven't any great hankerin' for that.\"\n\n\"Oh, the wonder of it!... I knew--I prayed--I trusted. Lassiter, I almost\ngave--all myself to soften you to Mormons. Thank God, and thank you, my\nfriend.... But, selfish woman that I am, this is no great test. What's\nthe life of one of those sneaking cowards to such a man as you? I think\nof your great hate toward him who--I think of your life's implacable\npurpose. Can it be--\"\n\n\"Wait!... Listen!\" he whispered. \"I hear a hoss.\"\n\nHe rose noiselessly, with his ear to the breeze. Suddenly he pulled his\nsombrero down over his bandaged head and, swinging his gun-sheaths round\nin front, he stepped into the alcove.\n\n\"It's a hoss--comin' fast,\" he added.\n\nJane's listening ear soon caught a faint, rapid, rhythmic beat of hoofs.\nIt came from the sage. It gave her a thrill that she was at a loss to\nunderstand. The sound rose stronger, louder. Then came a clear, sharp\ndifference when the horse passed from the sage trail to the hard-packed\nground of the grove. It became a ringing run--swift in its bell-like\nclatterings, yet singular in longer pause than usual between the\nhoofbeats of a horse.\n\n\"It's Wrangle!... It's Wrangle!\" cried Jane Withersteen. \"I'd know him\nfrom a million horses!\"\n\nExcitement and thrilling expectancy flooded out all Jane Withersteen's\ncalm. A tight band closed round her breast as she saw the giant sorrel\nflit in reddish-brown flashes across the openings in the green. Then\nhe was pounding down the lane--thundering into the court--crashing his\ngreat iron-shod hoofs on the stone flags. Wrangle it was surely, but\nshaggy and wild-eyed, and sage-streaked, with dust-caked lather staining\nhis flanks. He reared and crashed down and plunged. The rider leaped\noff, threw the bridle, and held hard on a lasso looped round Wrangle's\nhead and neck. Janet's heart sank as she tried to recognize Venters in\nthe rider. Something familiar struck her in the lofty stature in the\nsweep of powerful shoulders. But this bearded, longhaired, unkempt man,\nwho wore ragged clothes patched with pieces of skin, and boots that\nshowed bare legs and feet--this dusty, dark, and wild rider could not\npossibly be Venters.\n\n\"Whoa, Wrangle, old boy! Come down. Easy now. So--so--so. You're home,\nold boy, and presently you can have a drink of water you'll remember.\"\n\nIn the voice Jane knew the rider to be Venters. He tied Wrangle to the\nhitching-rack and turned to the court.\n\n\"Oh, Bern!... You wild man!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Jane--Jane, it's good to see you! Hello, Lassiter! Yes, it's Venters.\"\n\nLike rough iron his hard hand crushed Jane's. In it she felt the\ndifference she saw in him. Wild, rugged, unshorn--yet how splendid! He\nhad gone away a boy--he had returned a man. He appeared taller, wider of\nshoulder, deeper-chested, more powerfully built. But was that only her\nfancy--he had always been a young giant--was the change one of spirit?\nHe might have been absent for years, proven by fire and steel, grown\nlike Lassiter, strong and cool and sure. His eyes--were they keener,\nmore flashing than before?--met hers with clear, frank, warm regard, in\nwhich perplexity was not, nor discontent, nor pain.\n\n\"Look at me long as you like,\" he said, with a laugh. \"I'm not much to\nlook at. And, Jane, neither you nor Lassiter, can brag. You're paler\nthan I ever saw you. Lassiter, here, he wears a bloody bandage under\nhis hat. That reminds me. Some one took a flying shot at me down in the\nsage. It made Wrangle run some.... Well, perhaps you've more to tell me\nthan I've got to tell you.\"\n\nBriefly, in few words, Jane outlined the circumstances of her undoing in\nthe weeks of his absence.\n\nUnder his beard and bronze she saw his face whiten in terrible wrath.\n\n\"Lassiter--what held you back?\"\n\nNo time in the long period of fiery moments and sudden shocks had Jane\nWithersteen ever beheld Lassiter as calm and serene and cool as then.\n\n\"Jane had gloom enough without my addin' to it by shootin' up the\nvillage,\" he said.\n\nAs strange as Lassiter's coolness was Venters's curious, intent scrutiny\nof them both, and under it Jane felt a flaming tide wave from bosom to\ntemples.\n\n\"Well--you're right,\" he said, with slow pause. \"It surprises me a\nlittle, that's all.\"\n\nJane sensed then a slight alteration in Venters, and what it was, in her\nown confusion, she could not tell. It had always been her intention\nto acquaint him with the deceit she had fallen to in her zeal to move\nLassiter. She did not mean to spare herself. Yet now, at the moment,\nbefore these riders, it was an impossibility to explain.\n\nVenters was speaking somewhat haltingly, without his former frankness.\n\"I found Oldring's hiding-place and your red herd. I learned--I\nknow--I'm sure there was a deal between Tull and Oldring.\" He paused\nand shifted his position and his gaze. He looked as if he wanted to say\nsomething that he found beyond him. Sorrow and pity and shame seemed\nto contend for mastery over him. Then he raised himself and spoke with\neffort. \"Jane I've cost you too much. You've almost ruined yourself\nfor me. It was wrong, for I'm not worth it. I never deserved such\nfriendship. Well, maybe it's not too late. You must give me up. Mind,\nI haven't changed. I am just the same as ever. I'll see Tull while I'm\nhere, and tell him to his face.\"\n\n\"Bern, it's too late,\" said Jane.\n\n\"I'll make him believe!\" cried Venters, violently.\n\n\"You ask me to break our friendship?\"\n\n\"Yes. If you don't, I shall.\"\n\n\"Forever?\"\n\n\"Forever!\"\n\nJane sighed. Another shadow had lengthened down the sage slope to\ncast further darkness upon her. A melancholy sweetness pervaded her\nresignation. The boy who had left her had returned a man, nobler,\nstronger, one in whom she divined something unbending as steel. There\nmight come a moment later when she would wonder why she had not fought\nagainst his will, but just now she yielded to it. She liked him as\nwell--nay, more, she thought, only her emotions were deadened by the\nlong, menacing wait for the bursting storm.\n\nOnce before she had held out her hand to him--when she gave it; now she\nstretched it tremblingly forth in acceptance of the decree circumstance\nhad laid upon them. Venters bowed over it kissed it, pressed it hard,\nand half stifled a sound very like a sob. Certain it was that when he\nraised his head tears glistened in his eyes.\n\n\"Some--women--have a hard lot,\" he said, huskily. Then he shook his\npowerful form, and his rags lashed about him. \"I'll say a few things to\nTull--when I meet him.\"\n\n\"Bern--you'll not draw on Tull? Oh, that must not be! Promise me--\"\n\n\"I promise you this,\" he interrupted, in stern passion that thrilled\nwhile it terrorized her. \"If you say one more word for that plotter I'll\nkill him as I would a mad coyote!\"\n\nJane clasped her hands. Was this fire-eyed man the one whom she had\nonce made as wax to her touch? Had Venters become Lassiter and Lassiter\nVenters?\n\n\"I'll--say no more,\" she faltered.\n\n\"Jane, Lassiter once called you blind,\" said Venters. \"It must be true.\nBut I won't upbraid you. Only don't rouse the devil in me by praying for\nTull! I'll try to keep cool when I meet him. That's all. Now there's one\nmore thing I want to ask of you--the last. I've found a valley down in\nthe Pass. It's a wonderful place. I intend to stay there. It's so hidden\nI believe no one can find it. There's good water, and browse, and game.\nI want to raise corn and stock. I need to take in supplies. Will you\ngive them to me?\"\n\n\"Assuredly. The more you take the better you'll please me--and perhaps\nthe less my--my enemies will get.\"\n\n\"Venters, I reckon you'll have trouble packin' anythin' away,\" put in\nLassiter.\n\n\"I'll go at night.\"\n\n\"Mebbe that wouldn't be best. You'd sure be stopped. You'd better go\nearly in the mornin'--say, just after dawn. That's the safest time to\nmove round here.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, I'll be hard to stop,\" returned Venters, darkly.\n\n\"I reckon so.\"\n\n\"Bern,\" said Jane, \"go first to the riders' quarters and get yourself a\ncomplete outfit. You're a--a sight. Then help yourself to whatever else\nyou need--burros, packs, grain, dried fruits, and meat. You must take\ncoffee and sugar and flour--all kinds of supplies. Don't forget corn and\nseeds. I remember how you used to starve. Please--please take all you\ncan pack away from here. I'll make a bundle for you, which you mustn't\nopen till you're in your valley. How I'd like to see it! To judge by you\nand Wrangle, how wild it must be!\"\n\nJane walked down into the outer court and approached the sorrel.\nUpstarting, he laid back his ears and eyed her.\n\n\"Wrangle--dear old Wrangle,\" she said, and put a caressing hand on his\nmatted mane. \"Oh, he's wild, but he knows me! Bern, can he run as fast\nas ever?\"\n\n\"Run? Jane, he's done sixty miles since last night at dark, and I could\nmake him kill Black Star right now in a ten-mile race.\"\n\n\"He never could,\" protested Jane. \"He couldn't even if he was fresh.\"\n\n\"I reckon mebbe the best hoss'll prove himself yet,\" said Lassiter,\n\"an', Jane, if it ever comes to that race I'd like you to be on\nWrangle.\"\n\n\"I'd like that, too,\" rejoined Venters. \"But, Jane, maybe Lassiter's\nhint is extreme. Bad as your prospects are, you'll surely never come to\nthe running point.\"\n\n\"Who knows!\" she replied, with mournful smile.\n\n\"No, no, Jane, it can't be so bad as all that. Soon as I see Tull\nthere'll be a change in your fortunes. I'll hurry down to the\nvillage.... Now don't worry.\"\n\nJane retired to the seclusion of her room. Lassiter's subtle forecasting\nof disaster, Venters's forced optimism, neither remained in mind.\nMaterial loss weighed nothing in the balance with other losses she\nwas sustaining. She wondered dully at her sitting there, hands folded\nlistlessly, with a kind of numb deadness to the passing of time and the\npassing of her riches. She thought of Venters's friendship. She had not\nlost that, but she had lost him. Lassiter's friendship--that was more\nthan love--it would endure, but soon he, too, would be gone. Little\nFay slept dreamlessly upon the bed, her golden curls streaming over the\npillow. Jane had the child's worship. Would she lose that, too? And if\nshe did, what then would be left? Conscience thundered at her that there\nwas left her religion. Conscience thundered that she should be grateful\non her knees for this baptism of fire; that through misfortune,\nsacrifice, and suffering her soul might be fused pure gold. But the old,\nspontaneous, rapturous spirit no more exalted her. She wanted to be a\nwoman--not a martyr. Like the saint of old who mortified his flesh,\nJane Withersteen had in her the temper for heroic martyrdom, if by\nsacrificing herself she could save the souls of others. But here the\ndamnable verdict blistered her that the more she sacrificed herself the\nblacker grew the souls of her churchmen. There was something terribly\nwrong with her soul, something terribly wrong with her churchmen and her\nreligion. In the whirling gulf of her thought there was yet one shining\nlight to guide her, to sustain her in her hope; and it was that, despite\nher errors and her frailties and her blindness, she had one absolute and\nunfaltering hold on ultimate and supreme justice. That was love. \"Love\nyour enemies as yourself!\" was a divine word, entirely free from any\nchurch or creed.\n\nJane's meditations were disturbed by Lassiter's soft, tinkling step in\nthe court. Always he wore the clinking spurs. Always he was in readiness\nto ride. She passed out and called him into the huge, dim hall.\n\n\"I think you'll be safer here. The court is too open,\" she said.\n\n\"I reckon,\" replied Lassiter. \"An' it's cooler here. The day's sure\nmuggy. Well, I went down to the village with Venters.\"\n\n\"Already! Where is he?\" queried Jane, in quick amaze.\n\n\"He's at the corrals. Blake's helpin' him get the burros an' packs\nready. That Blake is a good fellow.\"\n\n\"Did--did Bern meet Tull?\"\n\n\"I guess he did,\" answered Lassiter, and he laughed dryly.\n\n\"Tell me! Oh, you exasperate me! You're so cool, so calm! For Heaven's\nsake, tell me what happened!\"\n\n\"First time I've been in the village for weeks,\" went on Lassiter,\nmildly. \"I reckon there 'ain't been more of a show for a long time. Me\nan' Venters walkin' down the road! It was funny. I ain't sayin' anybody\nwas particular glad to see us. I'm not much thought of hereabouts, an'\nVenters he sure looks like what you called him, a wild man. Well, there\nwas some runnin' of folks before we got to the stores. Then everybody\nvamoosed except some surprised rustlers in front of a saloon. Venters\nwent right in the stores an' saloons, an' of course I went along. I\ndon't know which tickled me the most--the actions of many fellers we\nmet, or Venters's nerve. Jane, I was downright glad to be along. You\nsee that sort of thing is my element, an' I've been away from it for\na spell. But we didn't find Tull in one of them places. Some Gentile\nfeller at last told Venters he'd find Tull in that long buildin' next to\nParsons's store. It's a kind of meetin'-room; and sure enough, when we\npeeped in, it was half full of men.\n\n\"Venters yelled: 'Don't anybody pull guns! We ain't come for that!' Then\nhe tramped in, an' I was some put to keep alongside him. There was a\nhard, scrapin' sound of feet, a loud cry, an' then some whisperin', an'\nafter that stillness you could cut with a knife. Tull was there,\nan' that fat party who once tried to throw a gun on me, an' other\nimportant-lookin' men, en' that little frog-legged feller who was with\nTull the day I rode in here. I wish you could have seen their faces,\n'specially Tull's an' the fat party's. But there ain't no use of me\ntryin' to tell you how they looked.\n\n\"Well, Venters an' I stood there in the middle of the room with that\nbatch of men all in front of us, en' not a blamed one of them winked an\neyelash or moved a finger. It was natural, of course, for me to notice\nmany of them packed guns. That's a way of mine, first noticin' them\nthings. Venters spoke up, an' his voice sort of chilled an' cut, en' he\ntold Tull he had a few things to say.\"\n\nHere Lassiter paused while he turned his sombrero round and round, in\nhis familiar habit, and his eyes had the look of a man seeing over again\nsome thrilling spectacle, and under his red bronze there was strange\nanimation.\n\n\"Like a shot, then, Venters told Tull that the friendship between you\nan' him was all over, an' he was leaving your place. He said you'd\nboth of you broken off in the hope of propitiatin' your people, but you\nhadn't changed your mind otherwise, an' never would.\n\n\"Next he spoke up for you. I ain't goin' to tell you what he said.\nOnly--no other woman who ever lived ever had such tribute! You had a\nchampion, Jane, an' never fear that those thick-skulled men don't know\nyou now. It couldn't be otherwise. He spoke the ringin', lightnin'\ntruth.... Then he accused Tull of the underhand, miserable robbery of a\nhelpless woman. He told Tull where the red herd was, of a deal made with\nOldrin', that Jerry Card had made the deal. I thought Tull was goin' to\ndrop, an' that little frog-legged cuss, he looked some limp an' white.\nBut Venters's voice would have kept anybody's legs from bucklin'. I was\nstiff myself. He went on an' called Tull--called him every bad name ever\nknown to a rider, an' then some. He cursed Tull. I never hear a man\nget such a cursin'. He laughed in scorn at the idea of Tull bein' a\nminister. He said Tull an' a few more dogs of hell builded their\nempire out of the hearts of such innocent an' God-fearin' women as Jane\nWithersteen. He called Tull a binder of women, a callous beast who hid\nbehind a mock mantle of righteousness--an' the last an' lowest coward\non the face of the earth. To prey on weak women through their\nreligion--that was the last unspeakable crime!\n\n\"Then he finished, an' by this time he'd almost lost his voice. But his\nwhisper was enough. 'Tull,' he said, 'she begged me not to draw on you\nto-day. She would pray for you if you burned her at the stake.... But\nlisten!... I swear if you and I ever come face to face again, I'll kill\nyou!'\n\n\"We backed out of the door then, an' up the road. But nobody follered\nus.\"\n\nJane found herself weeping passionately. She had not been conscious of\nit till Lassiter ended his story, and she experienced exquisite pain and\nrelief in shedding tears. Long had her eyes been dry, her grief deep;\nlong had her emotions been dumb. Lassiter's story put her on the rack;\nthe appalling nature of Venters's act and speech had no parallel as an\noutrage; it was worse than bloodshed. Men like Tull had been shot, but\nhad one ever been so terribly denounced in public? Over-mounting her\nhorror, an uncontrollable, quivering passion shook her very soul. It was\nsheer human glory in the deed of a fearless man. It was hot, primitive\ninstinct to live--to fight. It was a kind of mad joy in Venters's\nchivalry. It was close to the wrath that had first shaken her in the\nbeginning of this war waged upon her.\n\n\"Well, well, Jane, don't take it that way,\" said Lassiter, in evident\ndistress. \"I had to tell you. There's some things a feller jest can't\nkeep. It's strange you give up on hearin' that, when all this long time\nyou've been the gamest woman I ever seen. But I don't know women. Mebbe\nthere's reason for you to cry. I know this--nothin' ever rang in my soul\nan' so filled it as what Venters did. I'd like to have done it, but--I'm\nonly good for throwin' a gun, en' it seems you hate that.... Well, I'll\nbe goin' now.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Venters took Wrangle to the stable. The sorrel's shy a shoe, an' I've\ngot to help hold the big devil an' put on another.\"\n\n\"Tell Bern to come for the pack I want to give him--and--and to say\ngood-by,\" called Jane, as Lassiter went out.\n\nJane passed the rest of that day in a vain endeavor to decide what and\nwhat not to put in the pack for Venters. This task was the last she\nwould ever perform for him, and the gifts were the last she would ever\nmake him. So she picked and chose and rejected, and chose again, and\noften paused in sad revery, and began again, till at length she filled\nthe pack.\n\nIt was about sunset, and she and Fay had finished supper and were\nsitting in the court, when Venters's quick steps rang on the stones.\nShe scarcely knew him, for he had changed the tattered garments, and\nshe missed the dark beard and long hair. Still he was not the Venters of\nold. As he came up the steps she felt herself pointing to the pack,\nand heard herself speaking words that were meaningless to her. He said\ngood-by; he kissed her, released her, and turned away. His tall figure\nblurred in her sight, grew dim through dark, streaked vision, and then\nhe vanished.\n\nTwilight fell around Withersteen House, and dusk and night. Little\nFay slept; but Jane lay with strained, aching eyes. She heard the wind\nmoaning in the cottonwoods and mice squeaking in the walls. The night\nwas interminably long, yet she prayed to hold back the dawn. What would\nanother day bring forth? The blackness of her room seemed blacker\nfor the sad, entering gray of morning light. She heard the chirp of\nawakening birds, and fancied she caught a faint clatter of hoofs. Then\nlow, dull distant, throbbed a heavy gunshot. She had expected it, was\nwaiting for it; nevertheless, an electric shock checked her heart, froze\nthe very living fiber of her bones. That vise-like hold on her faculties\napparently did not relax for a long time, and it was a voice under her\nwindow that released her.\n\n\"Jane!... Jane!\" softly called Lassiter.\n\nShe answered somehow.\n\n\"It's all right. Venters got away. I thought mebbe you'd heard that\nshot, en' I was worried some.\"\n\n\"What was it--who fired?\"\n\n\"Well--some fool feller tried to stop Venters out there in the sage--an'\nhe only stopped lead!... I think it'll be all right. I haven't seen or\nheard of any other fellers round. Venters'll go through safe. An', Jane,\nI've got Bells saddled, an' I'm going to trail Venters. Mind, I won't\nshow myself unless he falls foul of somebody an' needs me. I want to see\nif this place where he's goin' is safe for him. He says nobody can track\nhim there. I never seen the place yet I couldn't track a man to. Now,\nJane, you stay indoors while I'm gone, an' keep close watch on Fay. Will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes! Oh yes!\"\n\n\"An' another thing, Jane,\" he continued, then paused for long--\"another\nthing--if you ain't here when I come back--if you're gone--don't fear,\nI'll trail you--I'll find you out.\"\n\n\"My dear Lassiter, where could I be gone--as you put it?\" asked Jane, in\ncurious surprise.\n\n\"I reckon you might be somewhere. Mebbe tied in an old barn--or\ncorralled in some gulch--or chained in a cave! Milly Erne was--till she\ngive in! Mebbe that's news to you.... Well, if you're gone I'll hunt for\nyou.\"\n\n\"No, Lassiter,\" she replied, sadly and low. \"If I'm gone just forget the\nunhappy woman whose blinded selfish deceit you repaid with kindness and\nlove.\"\n\nShe heard a deep, muttering curse, under his breath, and then the\nsilvery tinkling of his spurs as he moved away.\n\nJane entered upon the duties of that day with a settled, gloomy calm.\nDisaster hung in the dark clouds, in the shade, in the humid west wind.\nBlake, when he reported, appeared without his usual cheer; and Jerd\nwore a harassed look of a worn and worried man. And when Judkins put\nin appearance, riding a lame horse, and dismounted with the cramp of\na rider, his dust-covered figure and his darkly grim, almost dazed\nexpression told Jane of dire calamity. She had no need of words.\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, I have to report--loss of the--white herd,\" said\nJudkins, hoarsely.\n\n\"Come, sit down, you look played out,\" replied Jane, solicitously. She\nbrought him brandy and food, and while he partook of refreshments, of\nwhich he appeared badly in need, she asked no questions.\n\n\"No one rider--could hev done more--Miss Withersteen,\" he went on,\npresently.\n\n\"Judkins, don't be distressed. You've done more than any other rider.\nI've long expected to lose the white herd. It's no surprise. It's\nin line with other things that are happening. I'm grateful for your\nservice.\"\n\n\"Miss Withersteen, I knew how you'd take it. But if anythin', that makes\nit harder to tell. You see, a feller wants to do so much fer you, an'\nI'd got fond of my job. We led the herd a ways off to the north of\nthe break in the valley. There was a big level an' pools of water an'\ntip-top browse. But the cattle was in a high nervous condition. Wild--as\nwild as antelope! You see, they'd been so scared they never slept. I\nain't a-goin' to tell you of the many tricks that were pulled off out\nthere in the sage. But there wasn't a day for weeks thet the herd didn't\nget started to run. We allus managed to ride 'em close an' drive 'em\nback an' keep 'em bunched. Honest, Miss Withersteen, them steers was\nthin. They was thin when water and grass was everywhere. Thin at this\nseason--thet'll tell you how your steers was pestered. Fer instance, one\nnight a strange runnin' streak of fire run right through the herd. That\nstreak was a coyote--with an oiled an' blazin' tail! Fer I shot it an'\nfound out. We had hell with the herd that night, an' if the sage an'\ngrass hadn't been wet--we, hosses, steers, an' all would hev burned up.\nBut I said I wasn't goin' to tell you any of the tricks.... Strange\nnow, Miss Withersteen, when the stampede did come it was from natural\ncause--jest a whirlin' devil of dust. You've seen the like often. An'\nthis wasn't no big whirl, fer the dust was mostly settled. It had dried\nout in a little swale, an' ordinarily no steer would ever hev run fer\nit. But the herd was nervous en' wild. An' jest as Lassiter said, when\nthat bunch of white steers got to movin' they was as bad as buffalo.\nI've seen some buffalo stampedes back in Nebraska, an' this bolt of the\nsteers was the same kind.\n\n\"I tried to mill the herd jest as Lassiter did. But I wasn't equal to\nit, Miss Withersteen. I don't believe the rider lives who could hev\nturned thet herd. We kept along of the herd fer miles, an' more 'n one\nof my boys tried to get the steers a-millin'. It wasn't no use. We got\noff level ground, goin' down, an' then the steers ran somethin' fierce.\nWe left the little gullies an' washes level-full of dead steers. Finally\nI saw the herd was makin' to pass a kind of low pocket between ridges.\nThere was a hog-back--as we used to call 'em--a pile of rocks stickin'\nup, and I saw the herd was goin' to split round it, or swing out to the\nleft. An' I wanted 'em to go to the right so mebbe we'd be able to drive\n'em into the pocket. So, with all my boys except three, I rode hard to\nturn the herd a little to the right. We couldn't budge 'em. They went on\nen' split round the rocks, en' the most of 'em was turned sharp to the\nleft by a deep wash we hedn't seen--hed no chance to see.\n\n\"The other three boys--Jimmy Vail, Joe Willis, an' thet little Cairns\nboy--a nervy kid! they, with Cairns leadin', tried to buck thet herd\nround to the pocket. It was a wild, fool idee. I couldn't do nothin'.\nThe boys got hemmed in between the steers an' the wash--thet they hedn't\nno chance to see, either. Vail an' Willis was run down right before our\neyes. An' Cairns, who rode a fine hoss, he did some ridin'. I never seen\nequaled, en' would hev beat the steers if there'd been any room to run\nin. I was high up an' could see how the steers kept spillin' by twos an'\nthrees over into the wash. Cairns put his hoss to a place thet was too\nwide fer any hoss, an' broke his neck an' the hoss's too. We found that\nout after, an' as fer Vail an' Willis--two thousand steers ran over the\npoor boys. There wasn't much left to pack home fer burying!... An', Miss\nWithersteen, thet all happened yesterday, en' I believe, if the white\nherd didn't run over the wall of the Pass, it's runnin' yet.\"\n\nOn the morning of the second day after Judkins's recital, during which\ntime Jane remained indoors a prey to regret and sorrow for the boy\nriders, and a new and now strangely insistent fear for her own person,\nshe again heard what she had missed more than she dared honestly\nconfess--the soft, jingling step of Lassiter. Almost overwhelming relief\nsurged through her, a feeling as akin to joy as any she could have\nbeen capable of in those gloomy hours of shadow, and one that suddenly\nstunned her with the significance of what Lassiter had come to mean to\nher. She had begged him, for his own sake, to leave Cottonwoods. She\nmight yet beg that, if her weakening courage permitted her to dare\nabsolute loneliness and helplessness, but she realized now that if she\nwere left alone her life would become one long, hideous nightmare.\n\nWhen his soft steps clinked into the hall, in answer to her greeting,\nand his tall, black-garbed form filled the door, she felt an\ninexpressible sense of immediate safety. In his presence she lost her\nfear of the dim passageways of Withersteen House and of every sound.\nAlways it had been that, when he entered the court or the hall, she\nhad experienced a distinctly sickening but gradually lessening shock\nat sight of the huge black guns swinging at his sides. This time the\nsickening shock again visited her, it was, however, because a revealing\nflash of thought told her that it was not alone Lassiter who was\nthrillingly welcome, but also his fatal weapons. They meant so much. How\nshe had fallen--how broken and spiritless must she be--to have still\nthe same old horror of Lassiter's guns and his name, yet feel somehow a\ncold, shrinking protection in their law and might and use.\n\n\"Did you trail Venters--find his wonderful valley?\" she asked, eagerly.\n\n\"Yes, an' I reckon it's sure a wonderful place.\"\n\n\"Is he safe there?\"\n\n\"That's been botherin' me some. I tracked him an' part of the trail was\nthe hardest I ever tackled. Mebbe there's a rustler or somebody in this\ncountry who's as good at trackin' as I am. If that's so Venters ain't\nsafe.\"\n\n\"Well--tell me all about Bern and his valley.\"\n\nTo Jane's surprise Lassiter showed disinclination for further talk about\nhis trip. He appeared to be extremely fatigued. Jane reflected that\none hundred and twenty miles, with probably a great deal of climbing\non foot, all in three days, was enough to tire any rider. Moreover, it\npresently developed that Lassiter had returned in a mood of singular\nsadness and preoccupation. She put it down to a moodiness over the loss\nof her white herd and the now precarious condition of her fortune.\n\nSeveral days passed, and as nothing happened, Jane's spirits began to\nbrighten. Once in her musings she thought that this tendency of hers\nto rebound was as sad as it was futile. Meanwhile, she had resumed her\nwalks through the grove with little Fay.\n\nOne morning she went as far as the sage. She had not seen the slope\nsince the beginning of the rains, and now it bloomed a rich deep purple.\nThere was a high wind blowing, and the sage tossed and waved and colored\nbeautifully from light to dark. Clouds scudded across the sky and their\nshadows sailed darkly down the sunny slope.\n\nUpon her return toward the house she went by the lane to the stables,\nand she had scarcely entered the great open space with its corrals and\nsheds when she saw Lassiter hurriedly approaching. Fay broke from her\nand, running to a corral fence, began to pat and pull the long, hanging\nears of a drowsy burro.\n\nOne look at Lassiter armed her for a blow.\n\nWithout a word he led her across the wide yard to the rise of the ground\nupon which the stable stood.\n\n\"Jane--look!\" he said, and pointed to the ground.\n\nJane glanced down, and again, and upon steadier vision made out\nsplotches of blood on the stones, and broad, smooth marks in the dust,\nleading out toward the sage.\n\n\"What made these?\" she asked.\n\n\"I reckon somebody has dragged dead or wounded men out to where there\nwas hosses in the sage.\"\n\n\"Dead--or--wounded--men!\"\n\n\"I reckon--Jane, are you strong? Can you bear up?\"\n\nHis hands were gently holding hers, and his eyes--suddenly she could no\nlonger look into them. \"Strong?\" she echoed, trembling. \"I--I will be.\"\n\nUp on the stone-flag drive, nicked with the marks made by the iron-shod\nhoofs of her racers, Lassiter led her, his grasp ever growing firmer.\n\n\"Where's Blake--and--and Jerb?\" she asked, haltingly.\n\n\"I don't know where Jerb is. Bolted, most likely,\" replied Lassiter, as\nhe took her through the stone door. \"But Blake--poor Blake! He's gone\nforever!... Be prepared, Jane.\"\n\nWith a cold prickling of her skin, with a queer thrumming in her ears,\nwith fixed and staring eyes, Jane saw a gun lying at her feet with\nchamber swung and empty, and discharged shells scattered near.\n\nOutstretched upon the stable floor lay Blake, ghastly white--dead--one\nhand clutching a gun and the other twisted in his bloody blouse.\n\n\"Whoever the thieves were, whether your people or rustlers--Blake killed\nsome of them!\" said Lassiter.\n\n\"Thieves?\" whispered Jane.\n\n\"I reckon. Hoss-thieves!... Look!\" Lassiter waved his hand toward the\nstalls.\n\nThe first stall--Bells's stall--was empty. All the stalls were empty. No\nracer whinnied and stamped greeting to her. Night was gone! Black Star\nwas gone!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. GOLD\n\nAs Lassiter had reported to Jane, Venters \"went through\" safely, and\nafter a toilsome journey reached the peaceful shelter of Surprise\nValley. When finally he lay wearily down under the silver spruces,\nresting from the strain of dragging packs and burros up the slope and\nthrough the entrance to Surprise Valley, he had leisure to think, and\na great deal of the time went in regretting that he had not been frank\nwith his loyal friend, Jane Withersteen.\n\nBut, he kept continually recalling, when he had stood once more face to\nface with her and had been shocked at the change in her and had heard\nthe details of her adversity, he had not had the heart to tell her of\nthe closer interest which had entered his life. He had not lied; yet he\nhad kept silence.\n\nBess was in transports over the stores of supplies and the outfit he had\npacked from Cottonwoods. He had certainly brought a hundred times\nmore than he had gone for; enough, surely, for years, perhaps to make\npermanent home in the valley. He saw no reason why he need ever leave\nthere again.\n\nAfter a day of rest he recovered his strength and shared Bess's pleasure\nin rummaging over the endless packs, and began to plan for the future.\nAnd in this planning, his trip to Cottonwoods, with its revived hate\nof Tull and consequent unleashing of fierce passions, soon faded out\nof mind. By slower degrees his friendship for Jane Withersteen and his\ncontrition drifted from the active preoccupation of his present thought\nto a place in memory, with more and more infrequent recalls.\n\nAnd as far as the state of his mind was concerned, upon the second day\nafter his return, the valley, with its golden hues and purple shades,\nthe speaking west wind and the cool, silent night, and Bess's watching\neyes with their wonderful light, so wrought upon Venters that he might\nnever have left them at all.\n\nThat very afternoon he set to work. Only one thing hindered him upon\nbeginning, though it in no wise checked his delight, and that in the\nmultiplicity of tasks planned to make a paradise out of the valley he\ncould not choose the one with which to begin. He had to grow into the\nhabit of passing from one dreamy pleasure to another, like a bee going\nfrom flower to flower in the valley, and he found this wandering habit\nlikely to extend to his labors. Nevertheless, he made a start.\n\nAt the outset he discovered Bess to be both a considerable help in some\nways and a very great hindrance in others. Her excitement and joy were\nspurs, inspirations; but she was utterly impracticable in her ideas,\nand she flitted from one plan to another with bewildering vacillation.\nMoreover, he fancied that she grew more eager, youthful, and sweet; and\nhe marked that it was far easier to watch her and listen to her than\nit was to work. Therefore he gave her tasks that necessitated her going\noften to the cave where he had stored his packs.\n\nUpon the last of these trips, when he was some distance down the terrace\nand out of sight of camp, he heard a scream, and then the sharp barking\nof the dogs.\n\nFor an instant he straightened up, amazed. Danger for her had been\nabsolutely out of his mind. She had seen a rattlesnake--or a wildcat.\nStill she would not have been likely to scream at sight of either; and\nthe barking of the dogs was ominous. Dropping his work, he dashed back\nalong the terrace. Upon breaking through a clump of aspens he saw the\ndark form of a man in the camp. Cold, then hot, Venters burst into\nfrenzied speed to reach his guns. He was cursing himself for a\nthoughtless fool when the man's tall form became familiar and he\nrecognized Lassiter. Then the reversal of emotions changed his run to\na walk; he tried to call out, but his voice refused to carry; when he\nreached camp there was Lassiter staring at the white-faced girl. By that\ntime Ring and Whitie had recognized him.\n\n\"Hello, Venters! I'm makin' you a visit,\" said Lassiter, slowly. \"An'\nI'm some surprised to see you've a--a young feller for company.\"\n\nOne glance had sufficed for the keen rider to read Bess's real sex, and\nfor once his cool calm had deserted him. He stared till the white of\nBess's cheeks flared into crimson. That, if it were needed, was the\nconcluding evidence of her femininity, for it went fittingly with her\nsun-tinted hair and darkened, dilated eyes, the sweetness of her mouth,\nand the striking symmetry of her slender shape.\n\n\"Heavens! Lassiter!\" panted Venters, when he caught his breath. \"What\nrelief--it's only you! How--in the name of all that's wonderful--did you\never get here?\"\n\n\"I trailed you. We--I wanted to know where you was, if you had a safe\nplace. So I trailed you.\"\n\n\"Trailed me,\" cried Venters, bluntly.\n\n\"I reckon. It was some of a job after I got to them smooth rocks. I was\nall day trackin' you up to them little cut steps in the rock. The rest\nwas easy.\"\n\n\"Where's your hoss? I hope you hid him.\"\n\n\"I tied him in them queer cedars down on the slope. He can't be seen\nfrom the valley.\"\n\n\"That's good. Well, well! I'm completely dumfounded. It was my idea that\nno man could track me in here.\"\n\n\"I reckon. But if there's a tracker in these uplands as good as me he\ncan find you.\"\n\n\"That's bad. That'll worry me. But, Lassiter, now you're here I'm glad\nto see you. And--and my companion here is not a young fellow!... Bess,\nthis is a friend of mine. He saved my life once.\"\n\nThe embarrassment of the moment did not extend to Lassiter. Almost at\nonce his manner, as he shook hands with Bess, relieved Venters and put\nthe girl at ease. After Venters's words and one quick look at Lassiter,\nher agitation stilled, and, though she was shy, if she were conscious\nof anything out of the ordinary in the situation, certainly she did not\nshow it.\n\n\"I reckon I'll only stay a little while,\" Lassiter was saying. \"An' if\nyou don't mind troublin', I'm hungry. I fetched some biscuits along, but\nthey're gone. Venters, this place is sure the wonderfullest ever seen.\nThem cut steps on the slope! That outlet into the gorge! An' it's like\nclimbin' up through hell into heaven to climb through that gorge into\nthis valley! There's a queer-lookin' rock at the top of the passage. I\ndidn't have time to stop. I'm wonderin' how you ever found this place.\nIt's sure interestin'.\"\n\nDuring the preparation and eating of dinner Lassiter listened mostly,\nas was his wont, and occasionally he spoke in his quaint and dry way.\nVenters noted, however, that the rider showed an increasing interest in\nBess. He asked her no questions, and only directed his attention to her\nwhile she was occupied and had no opportunity to observe his scrutiny.\nIt seemed to Venters that Lassiter grew more and more absorbed in his\nstudy of Bess, and that he lost his coolness in some strange, softening\nsympathy. Then, quite abruptly, he arose and announced the necessity\nfor his early departure. He said good-by to Bess in a voice gentle and\nsomewhat broken, and turned hurriedly away. Venters accompanied him, and\nthey had traversed the terrace, climbed the weathered slope, and passed\nunder the stone bridge before either spoke again.\n\nThen Lassiter put a great hand on Venters's shoulder and wheeled him to\nmeet a smoldering fire of gray eyes.\n\n\"Lassiter, I couldn't tell Jane! I couldn't,\" burst out Venters, reading\nhis friend's mind. \"I tried. But I couldn't. She wouldn't understand,\nand she has troubles enough. And I love the girl!\"\n\n\"Venters, I reckon this beats me. I've seen some queer things in my\ntime, too. This girl--who is she?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Don't know! What is she, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know that, either. Oh, it's the strangest story you ever heard.\nI must tell you. But you'll never believe.\"\n\n\"Venters, women were always puzzles to me. But for all that, if this\ngirl ain't a child, an' as innocent, I'm no fit person to think of\nvirtue an' goodness in anybody. Are you goin' to be square with her?\"\n\n\"I am--so help me God!\"\n\n\"I reckoned so. Mebbe my temper oughtn't led me to make sure. But, man,\nshe's a woman in all but years. She's sweeter 'n the sage.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, I know, I know. And the hell of it is that in spite of her\ninnocence and charm she's--she's not what she seems!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to--of course, I couldn't call you a liar, Venters,\"\nsaid the older man.\n\n\"What's more, she was Oldring's Masked Rider!\"\n\nVenters expected to floor his friend with that statement, but he was not\nin any way prepared for the shock his words gave. For an instant he was\nastounded to see Lassiter stunned; then his own passionate eagerness\nto unbosom himself, to tell the wonderful story, precluded any other\nthought.\n\n\"Son, tell me all about this,\" presently said Lassiter as he seated\nhimself on a stone and wiped his moist brow.\n\nThereupon Venters began his narrative at the point where he had shot the\nrustler and Oldring's Masked Rider, and he rushed through it, telling\nall, not holding back even Bess's unreserved avowal of her love or his\ndeepest emotions.\n\n\"That's the story,\" he said, concluding. \"I love her, though I've never\ntold her. If I did tell her I'd be ready to marry her, and that seems\nimpossible in this country. I'd be afraid to risk taking her anywhere.\nSo I intend to do the best I can for her here.\"\n\n\"The longer I live the stranger life is,\" mused Lassiter, with downcast\neyes. \"I'm reminded of somethin' you once said to Jane about hands in\nher game of life. There's that unseen hand of power, an' Tull's black\nhand, an' my red one, an' your indifferent one, an' the girl's little\nbrown, helpless one. An', Venters there's another one that's all-wise\nan' all-wonderful. That's the hand guidin' Jane Withersteen's game of\nlife!... Your story's one to daze a far clearer head than mine. I can't\noffer no advice, even if you asked for it. Mebbe I can help you. Anyway,\nI'll hold Oldrin' up when he comes to the village an' find out about\nthis girl. I knew the rustler years ago. He'll remember me.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, if I ever meet Oldring I'll kill him!\" cried Venters, with\nsudden intensity.\n\n\"I reckon that'd be perfectly natural,\" replied the rider.\n\n\"Make him think Bess is dead--as she is to him and that old life.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure, son. Cool down now. If you're goin' to begin pullin' guns\non Tull an' Oldin' you want to be cool. I reckon, though, you'd better\nkeep hid here. Well, I must be leavin'.\"\n\n\"One thing, Lassiter. You'll not tell Jane about Bess? Please don't!\"\n\n\"I reckon not. But I wouldn't be afraid to bet that after she'd got\nover anger at your secrecy--Venters, she'd be furious once in her\nlife!--she'd think more of you. I don't mind sayin' for myself that I\nthink you're a good deal of a man.\"\n\nIn the further ascent Venters halted several times with the intention of\nsaying good-by, yet he changed his mind and kept on climbing till they\nreached Balancing Rock. Lassiter examined the huge rock, listened to\nVenters's idea of its position and suggestion, and curiously placed a\nstrong hand upon it.\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried Venters. \"I heaved at it once and have never gotten\nover my scare.\"\n\n\"Well, you do seem uncommon nervous,\" replied Lassiter, much amused.\n\"Now, as for me, why I always had the funniest notion to roll stones!\nWhen I was a kid I did it, an' the bigger I got the bigger stones I'd\nroll. Ain't that funny? Honest--even now I often get off my hoss just to\ntumble a big stone over a precipice, en' watch it drop, en' listen to it\nbang an' boom. I've started some slides in my time, an' don't you forget\nit. I never seen a rock I wanted to roll as bad as this one! Wouldn't\nthere jest be roarin', crashin' hell down that trail?\"\n\n\"You'd close the outlet forever!\" exclaimed Venters. \"Well, good-by,\nLassiter. Keep my secret and don't forget me. And be mighty careful how\nyou get out of the valley below. The rustlers' canyon isn't more than\nthree miles up the Pass. Now you've tracked me here, I'll never feel\nsafe again.\"\n\nIn his descent to the valley, Venters's emotion, roused to stirring\npitch by the recital of his love story, quieted gradually, and in its\nplace came a sober, thoughtful mood. All at once he saw that he was\nserious, because he would never more regain his sense of security while\nin the valley. What Lassiter could do another skilful tracker might\nduplicate. Among the many riders with whom Venters had ridden he\nrecalled no one who could have taken his trail at Cottonwoods and have\nfollowed it to the edge of the bare slope in the pass, let alone up that\nglistening smooth stone. Lassiter, however, was not an ordinary rider.\nInstead of hunting cattle tracks he had likely spent a goodly portion\nof his life tracking men. It was not improbable that among Oldring's\nrustlers there was one who shared Lassiter's gift for trailing. And the\nmore Venters dwelt on this possibility the more perturbed he grew.\n\nLassiter's visit, moreover, had a disquieting effect upon Bess, and\nVenters fancied that she entertained the same thought as to future\nseclusion. The breaking of their solitude, though by a well-meaning\nfriend, had not only dispelled all its dream and much of its charm, but\nhad instilled a canker of fear. Both had seen the footprint in the sand.\n\nVenters did no more work that day. Sunset and twilight gave way to\nnight, and the canyon bird whistled its melancholy notes, and the wind\nsang softly in the cliffs, and the camp-fire blazed and burned down to\nred embers. To Venters a subtle difference was apparent in all of these,\nor else the shadowy change had been in him. He hoped that on the morrow\nthis slight depression would have passed away.\n\nIn that measure, however, he was doomed to disappointment. Furthermore,\nBess reverted to a wistful sadness that he had not observed in her since\nher recovery. His attempt to cheer her out of it resulted in dismal\nfailure, and consequently in a darkening of his own mood. Hard work\nrelieved him; still, when the day had passed, his unrest returned.\nThen he set to deliberate thinking, and there came to him the startling\nconviction that he must leave Surprise Valley and take Bess with him.\nAs a rider he had taken many chances, and as an adventurer in Deception\nPass he had unhesitatingly risked his life, but now he would run no\npreventable hazard of Bess's safety and happiness, and he was too keen\nnot to see that hazard. It gave him a pang to think of leaving the\nbeautiful valley just when he had the means to establish a permanent\nand delightful home there. One flashing thought tore in hot temptation\nthrough his mind--why not climb up into the gorge, roll Balancing Rock\ndown the trail, and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass? \"That\nwas the beast in me--showing his teeth!\" muttered Venters, scornfully.\n\"I'll just kill him good and quick! I'll be fair to this girl, if it's\nthe last thing I do on earth!\"\n\nAnother day went by, in which he worked less and pondered more and\nall the time covertly watched Bess. Her wistfulness had deepened into\ndownright unhappiness, and that made his task to tell her all the\nharder. He kept the secret another day, hoping by some chance she might\ngrow less moody, and to his exceeding anxiety she fell into far deeper\ngloom. Out of his own secret and the torment of it he divined that she,\ntoo, had a secret and the keeping of it was torturing her. As yet he had\nno plan thought out in regard to how or when to leave the valley, but\nhe decided to tell her the necessity of it and to persuade her to go.\nFurthermore, he hoped his speaking out would induce her to unburden her\nown mind.\n\n\"Bess, what's wrong with you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered, with averted face.\n\nVenters took hold of her gently, though masterfully, forced her to meet\nhis eyes.\n\n\"You can't look at me and lie,\" he said. \"Now--what's wrong with you?\nYou're keeping something from me. Well, I've got a secret, too, and I\nintend to tell it presently.\"\n\n\"Oh--I have a secret. I was crazy to tell you when you came back.\nThat's why I was so silly about everything. I kept holding my secret\nback--gloating over it. But when Lassiter came I got an idea--that\nchanged my mind. Then I hated to tell you.\"\n\n\"Are you going to now?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes. I was coming to it. I tried yesterday, but you were so cold.\nI was afraid. I couldn't keep it much longer.\"\n\n\"Very well, most mysterious lady, tell your wonderful secret.\"\n\n\"You needn't laugh,\" she retorted, with a first glimpse of reviving\nspirit. \"I can take the laugh out of you in one second.\"\n\n\"It's a go.\"\n\nShe ran through the spruces to the cave, and returned carrying something\nwhich was manifestly heavy. Upon nearer view he saw that whatever she\nheld with such evident importance had been bound up in a black scarf\nhe well remembered. That alone was sufficient to make him tingle with\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Have you any idea what I did in your absence?\" she asked.\n\n\"I imagine you lounged about, waiting and watching for me,\" he replied,\nsmiling. \"I've my share of conceit, you know.\"\n\n\"You're wrong. I worked. Look at my hands.\" She dropped on her knees\nclose to where he sat, and, carefully depositing the black bundle, she\nheld out her hands. The palms and inside of her fingers were white,\npuckered, and worn.\n\n\"Why, Bess, you've been fooling in the water,\" he said.\n\n\"Fooling? Look here!\" With deft fingers she spread open the black scarf,\nand the bright sun shone upon a dull, glittering heap of gold.\n\n\"Gold!\" he ejaculated.\n\n\"Yes, gold! See, pounds of gold! I found it--washed it out of the\nstream--picked it out grain by grain, nugget by nugget!\"\n\n\"Gold!\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes. Now--now laugh at my secret!\"\n\nFor a long minute Venters gazed. Then he stretched forth a hand to feel\nif the gold was real.\n\n\"Gold!\" he almost shouted. \"Bess, there are hundreds--thousands of\ndollars' worth here!\"\n\nHe leaned over to her, and put his hand, strong and clenching now, on\nhers.\n\n\"Is there more where this came from?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Plenty of it, all the way up the stream to the cliff. You know I've\noften washed for gold. Then I've heard the men talk. I think there's no\ngreat quantity of gold here, but enough for--for a fortune for you.\"\n\n\"That--was--your--secret!\"\n\n\"Yes. I hate gold. For it makes men mad. I've seen them drunk with joy\nand dance and fling themselves around. I've seen them curse and rave.\nI've seen them fight like dogs and roll in the dust. I've seen them kill\neach other for gold.\"\n\n\"Is that why you hated to tell me?\"\n\n\"Not--not altogether.\" Bess lowered her head. \"It was because I knew\nyou'd never stay here long after you found gold.\"\n\n\"You were afraid I'd leave you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Listen!... You great, simple child! Listen... You sweet, wonderful, wild,\nblue-eyed girl! I was tortured by my secret. It was that I knew we--we\nmust leave the valley. We can't stay here much longer. I couldn't think\nhow we'd get away--out of the country--or how we'd live, if we ever got\nout. I'm a beggar. That's why I kept my secret. I'm poor. It takes money\nto make way beyond Sterling. We couldn't ride horses or burros or walk\nforever. So while I knew we must go, I was distracted over how to go\nand what to do. Now! We've gold! Once beyond Sterling, we'll be safe from\nrustlers. We've no others to fear.\n\n\"Oh! Listen! Bess!\" Venters now heard his voice ringing high and sweet,\nand he felt Bess's cold hands in his crushing grasp as she leaned toward\nhim pale, breathless. \"This is how much I'd leave you! You made me live\nagain! I'll take you away--far away from this wild country. You'll begin\na new life. You'll be happy. You shall see cities, ships, people. You\nshall have anything your heart craves. All the shame and sorrow of your\nlife shall be forgotten--as if they had never been. This is how much I'd\nleave you here alone--you sad-eyed girl. I love you! Didn't you know it?\nHow could you fail to know it? I love you! I'm free! I'm a man--a man\nyou've made--no more a beggar!... Kiss me! This is how much I'd leave\nyou here alone--you beautiful, strange, unhappy girl. But I'll make you\nhappy. What--what do I care for--your past! I love you! I'll take you\nhome to Illinois--to my mother. Then I'll take you to far places. I'll\nmake up all you've lost. Oh, I know you love me--knew it before you told\nme. And it changed my life. And you'll go with me, not as my companion\nas you are here, nor my sister, but, Bess, darling!... As my wife!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. WRANGLE'S RACE RUN\n\nThe plan eventually decided upon by the lovers was for Venters to go to\nthe village, secure a horse and some kind of a disguise for Bess, or\nat least less striking apparel than her present garb, and to return\npost-haste to the valley. Meanwhile, she would add to their store of\ngold. Then they would strike the long and perilous trail to ride out of\nUtah. In the event of his inability to fetch back a horse for her, they\nintended to make the giant sorrel carry double. The gold, a little food,\nsaddle blankets, and Venters's guns were to compose the light outfit\nwith which they would make the start.\n\n\"I love this beautiful place,\" said Bess. \"It's hard to think of leaving\nit.\"\n\n\"Hard! Well, I should think so,\" replied Venters. \"Maybe--in years--\"\nBut he did not complete in words his thought that might be possible to\nreturn after many years of absence and change.\n\nOnce again Bess bade Venters farewell under the shadow of Balancing\nRock, and this time it was with whispered hope and tenderness and\npassionate trust. Long after he had left her, all down through the\noutlet to the Pass, the clinging clasp of her arms, the sweetness of\nher lips, and the sense of a new and exquisite birth of character in her\nremained hauntingly and thrillingly in his mind. The girl who had sadly\ncalled herself nameless and nothing had been marvelously transformed\nin the moment of his avowal of love. It was something to think over,\nsomething to warm his heart, but for the present it had absolutely to be\nforgotten so that all his mind could be addressed to the trip so fraught\nwith danger.\n\nHe carried only his rifle, revolver, and a small quantity of bread and\nmeat, and thus lightly burdened, he made swift progress down the slope\nand out into the valley. Darkness was coming on, and he welcomed it.\nStars were blinking when he reached his old hiding-place in the split of\ncanyon wall, and by their aid he slipped through the dense thickets to\nthe grassy enclosure. Wrangle stood in the center of it with his head\nup, and he appeared black and of gigantic proportions in the dim light.\nVenters whistled softly, began a slow approach, and then called. The\nhorse snorted and, plunging away with dull, heavy sound of hoofs, he\ndisappeared in the gloom. \"Wilder than ever!\" muttered Venters. He\nfollowed the sorrel into the narrowing split between the walls, and\npresently had to desist because he could not see a foot in advance. As\nhe went back toward the open Wrangle jumped out of an ebony shadow of\ncliff and like a thunderbolt shot huge and black past him down into\nthe starlit glade. Deciding that all attempts to catch Wrangle at night\nwould be useless, Venters repaired to the shelving rock where he had\nhidden saddle and blanket, and there went to sleep.\n\nThe first peep of day found him stirring, and as soon as it was light\nenough to distinguish objects, he took his lasso off his saddle and went\nout to rope the sorrel. He espied Wrangle at the lower end of the cove\nand approached him in a perfectly natural manner. When he got near\nenough, Wrangle evidently recognized him, but was too wild to stand.\nHe ran up the glade and on into the narrow lane between the walls. This\nfavored Venters's speedy capture of the horse, so, coiling his noose\nready to throw, he hurried on. Wrangle let Venters get to within a\nhundred feet and then he broke. But as he plunged by, rapidly getting\ninto his stride, Venters made a perfect throw with the rope. He had\ntime to brace himself for the shock; nevertheless, Wrangle threw him and\ndragged him several yards before halting.\n\n\"You wild devil,\" said Venters, as he slowly pulled Wrangle up. \"Don't\nyou know me? Come now--old fellow--so--so--\"\n\nWrangle yielded to the lasso and then to Venters's strong hand. He was\nas straggly and wild-looking as a horse left to roam free in the sage.\nHe dropped his long ears and stood readily to be saddled and bridled.\nBut he was exceedingly sensitive, and quivered at every touch and sound.\nVenters led him to the thicket, and, bending the close saplings to let\nhim squeeze through, at length reached the open. Sharp survey in each\ndirection assured him of the usual lonely nature of the canyon, then he\nwas in the saddle, riding south.\n\nWrangle's long, swinging canter was a wonderful ground-gainer. His\nstride was almost twice that of an ordinary horse; and his endurance was\nequally remarkable. Venters pulled him in occasionally, and walked him\nup the stretches of rising ground and along the soft washes. Wrangle\nhad never yet shown any indication of distress while Venters rode him.\nNevertheless, there was now reason to save the horse, therefore Venters\ndid not resort to the hurry that had characterized his former trip.\nHe camped at the last water in the Pass. What distance that was to\nCottonwoods he did not know; he calculated, however, that it was in the\nneighborhood of fifty miles.\n\nEarly in the morning he proceeded on his way, and about the middle of\nthe forenoon reached the constricted gap that marked the southerly end\nof the Pass, and through which led the trail up to the sage-level. He\nspied out Lassiter's tracks in the dust, but no others, and dismounting,\nhe straightened out Wrangle's bridle and began to lead him up the trail.\nThe short climb, more severe on beast than on man, necessitated a rest\non the level above, and during this he scanned the wide purple reaches\nof slope.\n\nWrangle whistled his pleasure at the smell of the sage. Remounting,\nVenters headed up the white trail with the fragrant wind in his face. He\nhad proceeded for perhaps a couple of miles when Wrangle stopped with a\nsuddenness that threw Venters heavily against the pommel.\n\n\"What's wrong, old boy?\" called Venters, looking down for a loose shoe\nor a snake or a foot lamed by a picked-up stone. Unrewarded, he raised\nhimself from his scrutiny. Wrangle stood stiff head high, with his\nlong ears erect. Thus guided, Venters swiftly gazed ahead to make out a\ndust-clouded, dark group of horsemen riding down the slope. If they had\nseen him, it apparently made no difference in their speed or direction.\n\n\"Wonder who they are!\" exclaimed Venters. He was not disposed to run.\nHis cool mood tightened under grip of excitement as he reflected that,\nwhoever the approaching riders were, they could not be friends. He\nslipped out of the saddle and led Wrangle behind the tallest sage-brush.\nIt might serve to conceal them until the riders were close enough for\nhim to see who they were; after that he would be indifferent to how soon\nthey discovered him.\n\nAfter looking to his rifle and ascertaining that it was in working\norder, he watched, and as he watched, slowly the force of a bitter\nfierceness, long dormant, gathered ready to flame into life. If those\nriders were not rustlers he had forgotten how rustlers looked and rode.\nOn they came, a small group, so compact and dark that he could not tell\ntheir number. How unusual that their horses did not see Wrangle! But\nsuch failure, Venters decided, was owing to the speed with which they\nwere traveling. They moved at a swift canter affected more by rustlers\nthan by riders. Venters grew concerned over the possibility that these\nhorsemen would actually ride down on him before he had a chance to\ntell what to expect. When they were within three hundred yards he\ndeliberately led Wrangle out into the trail.\n\nThen he heard shouts, and the hard scrape of sliding hoofs, and saw\nhorses rear and plunge back with up-flung heads and flying manes.\nSeveral little white puffs of smoke appeared sharply against the black\nbackground of riders and horses, and shots rang out. Bullets struck far\nin front of Venters, and whipped up the dust and then hummed low into\nthe sage. The range was great for revolvers, but whether the shots were\nmeant to kill or merely to check advance, they were enough to fire that\nwaiting ferocity in Venters. Slipping his arm through the bridle, so\nthat Wrangle could not get away, Venters lifted his rifle and pulled the\ntrigger twice.\n\nHe saw the first horseman lean sideways and fall. He saw another lurch\nin his saddle and heard a cry of pain. Then Wrangle, plunging in fright,\nlifted Venters and nearly threw him. He jerked the horse down with\na powerful hand and leaped into the saddle. Wrangle plunged again,\ndragging his bridle, that Venters had not had time to throw in place.\nBending over with a swift movement, he secured it and dropped the loop\nover the pommel. Then, with grinding teeth, he looked to see what the\nissue would be.\n\nThe band had scattered so as not to afford such a broad mark for\nbullets. The riders faced Venters, some with red-belching guns. He heard\na sharper report, and just as Wrangle plunged again he caught the whim\nof a leaden missile that would have hit him but for Wrangle's sudden\njump. A swift, hot wave, turning cold, passed over Venters. Deliberately\nhe picked out the one rider with a carbine, and killed him. Wrangle\nsnorted shrilly and bolted into the sage. Venters let him run a few\nrods, then with iron arm checked him.\n\nFive riders, surely rustlers, were left. One leaped out of the saddle to\nsecure his fallen comrade's carbine. A shot from Venters, which missed\nthe man but sent the dust flying over him made him run back to his\nhorse. Then they separated. The crippled rider went one way; the one\nfrustrated in his attempt to get the carbine rode another, Venters\nthought he made out a third rider, carrying a strange-appearing bundle\nand disappearing in the sage. But in the rapidity of action and vision\nhe could not discern what it was. Two riders with three horses swung\nout to the right. Afraid of the long rifle--a burdensome weapon seldom\ncarried by rustlers or riders--they had been put to rout.\n\nSuddenly Venters discovered that one of the two men last noted was\nriding Jane Withersteen's horse Bells--the beautiful bay racer she had\ngiven to Lassiter. Venters uttered a savage outcry. Then the small,\nwiry, frog-like shape of the second rider, and the ease and grace of his\nseat in the saddle--things so strikingly incongruous--grew more and more\nfamiliar in Venters's sight.\n\n\"Jerry Card!\" cried Venters.\n\nIt was indeed Tull's right-hand man. Such a white hot wrath inflamed\nVenters that he fought himself to see with clearer gaze.\n\n\"It's Jerry Card!\" he exclaimed, instantly. \"And he's riding Black Star\nand leading Night!\"\n\nThe long-kindling, stormy fire in Venters's heart burst into flame. He\nspurred Wrangle, and as the horse lengthened his stride Venters slipped\ncartridges into the magazine of his rifle till it was once again full.\nCard and his companion were now half a mile or more in advance, riding\neasily down the slope. Venters marked the smooth gait, and understood it\nwhen Wrangle galloped out of the sage into the broad cattle trail,\ndown which Venters had once tracked Jane Withersteen's red herd. This\nhard-packed trail, from years of use, was as clean and smooth as a road.\nVenters saw Jerry Card look back over his shoulder, the other rider did\nlikewise. Then the three racers lengthened their stride to the point\nwhere the swinging canter was ready to break into a gallop.\n\n\"Wrangle, the race's on,\" said Venters, grimly. \"We'll canter with them\nand gallop with them and run with them. We'll let them set the pace.\"\n\nVenters knew he bestrode the strongest, swiftest, most tireless horse\never ridden by any rider across the Utah uplands. Recalling Jane\nWithersteen's devoted assurance that Night could run neck and neck with\nWrangle, and Black Star could show his heels to him, Venters wished\nthat Jane were there to see the race to recover her blacks and in the\nunqualified superiority of the giant sorrel. Then Venters found himself\nthankful that she was absent, for he meant that race to end in Jerry\nCard's death. The first flush, the raging of Venters's wrath, passed, to\nleave him in sullen, almost cold possession of his will. It was a deadly\nmood, utterly foreign to his nature, engendered, fostered, and released\nby the wild passions of wild men in a wild country. The strength in\nhim then--the thing rife in him that was not hate, but something as\nremorseless--might have been the fiery fruition of a whole lifetime of\nvengeful quest. Nothing could have stopped him.\n\nVenters thought out the race shrewdly. The rider on Bells would probably\ndrop behind and take to the sage. What he did was of little moment\nto Venters. To stop Jerry Card, his evil hidden career as well as\nhis present flight, and then to catch the blacks--that was all that\nconcerned Venters. The cattle trail wound for miles and miles down the\nslope. Venters saw with a rider's keen vision ten, fifteen, twenty miles\nof clear purple sage. There were no on-coming riders or rustlers to aid\nCard. His only chance to escape lay in abandoning the stolen horses and\ncreeping away in the sage to hide. In ten miles Wrangle could run\nBlack Star and Night off their feet, and in fifteen he could kill them\noutright. So Venters held the sorrel in, letting Card make the running.\nIt was a long race that would save the blacks.\n\nIn a few miles of that swinging canter Wrangle had crept appreciably\ncloser to the three horses. Jerry Card turned again, and when he saw how\nthe sorrel had gained, he put Black Star to a gallop. Night and Bells,\non either side of him, swept into his stride.\n\nVenters loosened the rein on Wrangle and let him break into a gallop.\nThe sorrel saw the horses ahead and wanted to run. But Venters\nrestrained him. And in the gallop he gained more than in the canter.\nBells was fast in that gait, but Black Star and Night had been trained\nto run. Slowly Wrangle closed the gap down to a quarter of a mile, and\ncrept closer and closer.\n\nJerry Card wheeled once more. Venters distinctly saw the red flash of\nhis red face. This time he looked long. Venters laughed. He knew what\npassed in Card's mind. The rider was trying to make out what horse it\nhappened to be that thus gained on Jane Withersteen's peerless racers.\nWrangle had so long been away from the village that not improbably Jerry\nhad forgotten. Besides, whatever Jerry's qualifications for his fame as\nthe greatest rider of the sage, certain it was that his best point was\nnot far-sightedness. He had not recognized Wrangle. After what must have\nbeen a searching gaze he got his comrade to face about. This action gave\nVenters amusement. It spoke so surely of the facts that neither Card\nnor the rustler actually knew their danger. Yet if they kept to the\ntrail--and the last thing such men would do would be to leave it--they\nwere both doomed.\n\nThis comrade of Card's whirled far around in his saddle, and he even\nshaded his eyes from the sun. He, too, looked long. Then, all at once,\nhe faced ahead again and, bending lower in the saddle, began to fling\nhis right arm up and down. That flinging Venters knew to be the lashing\nof Bells. Jerry also became active. And the three racers lengthened out\ninto a run.\n\n\"Now, Wrangle!\" cried Venters. \"Run, you big devil! Run!\"\n\nVenters laid the reins on Wrangle's neck and dropped the loop over\nthe pommel. The sorrel needed no guiding on that smooth trail. He was\nsurer-footed in a run than at any other fast gait, and his running gave\nthe impression of something devilish. He might now have been actuated by\nVenters's spirit; undoubtedly his savage running fitted the mood of his\nrider. Venters bent forward swinging with the horse, and gripped his\nrifle. His eye measured the distance between him and Jerry Card.\n\nIn less than two miles of running Bells began to drop behind the blacks,\nand Wrangle began to overhaul him. Venters anticipated that the rustler\nwould soon take to the sage. Yet he did not. Not improbably he reasoned\nthat the powerful sorrel could more easily overtake Bells in the heavier\ngoing outside of the trail. Soon only a few hundred yards lay between\nBells and Wrangle. Turning in his saddle, the rustler began to shoot,\nand the bullets beat up little whiffs of dust. Venters raised his rifle,\nready to take snap shots, and waited for favorable opportunity when\nBells was out of line with the forward horses. Venters had it in him\nto kill these men as if they were skunk-bitten coyotes, but also he had\nrestraint enough to keep from shooting one of Jane's beloved Arabians.\n\nNo great distance was covered, however, before Bells swerved to the\nleft, out of line with Black Star and Night. Then Venters, aiming high\nand waiting for the pause between Wrangle's great strides, began to take\nsnap shots at the rustler. The fleeing rider presented a broad target\nfor a rifle, but he was moving swiftly forward and bobbing up and down.\nMoreover, shooting from Wrangle's back was shooting from a thunderbolt.\nAnd added to that was the danger of a low-placed bullet taking effect\non Bells. Yet, despite these considerations, making the shot exceedingly\ndifficult, Venters's confidence, like his implacability, saw a speedy\nand fatal termination of that rustler's race. On the sixth shot the\nrustler threw up his arms and took a flying tumble off his horse. He\nrolled over and over, hunched himself to a half-erect position, fell,\nand then dragged himself into the sage. As Venters went thundering by he\npeered keenly into the sage, but caught no sign of the man. Bells ran a\nfew hundred yards, slowed up, and had stopped when Wrangle passed him.\n\nAgain Venters began slipping fresh cartridges into the magazine of his\nrifle, and his hand was so sure and steady that he did not drop a single\ncartridge. With the eye of a rider and the judgment of a marksman he\nonce more measured the distance between him and Jerry Card. Wrangle had\ngained, bringing him into rifle range. Venters was hard put to it now\nnot to shoot, but thought it better to withhold his fire. Jerry, who, in\nanticipation of a running fusillade, had huddled himself into a little\ntwisted ball on Black Star's neck, now surmising that this pursuer would\nmake sure of not wounding one of the blacks, rose to his natural seat in\nthe saddle.\n\nIn his mind perhaps, as certainly as in Venters's, this moment was the\nbeginning of the real race.\n\nVenters leaned forward to put his hand on Wrangle's neck, then backward\nto put it on his flank. Under the shaggy, dusty hair trembled and\nvibrated and rippled a wonderful muscular activity. But Wrangle's flesh\nwas still cold. What a cold-blooded brute thought Venters, and felt in\nhim a love for the horse he had never given to any other. It would not\nhave been humanly possible for any rider, even though clutched by hate\nor revenge or a passion to save a loved one or fear of his own life, to\nbe astride the sorrel to swing with his swing, to see his magnificent\nstride and hear the rapid thunder of his hoofs, to ride him in that race\nand not glory in the ride.\n\nSo, with his passion to kill still keen and unabated, Venters lived out\nthat ride, and drank a rider's sage-sweet cup of wildness to the dregs.\n\nWhen Wrangle's long mane, lashing in the wind, stung Venters in the\ncheek, the sting added a beat to his flying pulse. He bent a downward\nglance to try to see Wrangle's actual stride, and saw only twinkling,\ndarting streaks and the white rush of the trail. He watched the sorrel's\nsavage head, pointed level, his mouth still closed and dry, but his\nnostrils distended as if he were snorting unseen fire. Wrangle was the\nhorse for a race with death. Upon each side Venters saw the sage merged\ninto a sailing, colorless wall. In front sloped the lay of ground with\nits purple breadth split by the white trail. The wind, blowing with\nheavy, steady blast into his face, sickened him with enduring, sweet\nodor, and filled his ears with a hollow, rushing roar.\n\nThen for the hundredth time he measured the width of space separating\nhim from Jerry Card. Wrangle had ceased to gain. The blacks were proving\ntheir fleetness. Venters watched Jerry Card, admiring the little rider's\nhorsemanship. He had the incomparable seat of the upland rider, born in\nthe saddle. It struck Venters that Card had changed his position, or\nthe position of the horses. Presently Venters remembered positively that\nJerry had been leading Night on the right-hand side of the trail. The\nracer was now on the side to the left. No--it was Black Star. But,\nVenters argued in amaze, Jerry had been mounted on Black Star. Another\nclearer, keener gaze assured Venters that Black Star was really\nriderless. Night now carried Jerry Card.\n\n\"He's changed from one to the other!\" ejaculated Venters, realizing the\nastounding feat with unstinted admiration. \"Changed at full speed! Jerry\nCard, that's what you've done unless I'm drunk on the smell of sage. But\nI've got to see the trick before I believe it.\"\n\nThenceforth, while Wrangle sped on, Venters glued his eyes to the little\nrider. Jerry Card rode as only he could ride. Of all the daring\nhorsemen of the uplands, Jerry was the one rider fitted to bring out the\ngreatness of the blacks in that long race. He had them on a dead run,\nbut not yet at the last strained and killing pace. From time to time he\nglanced backward, as a wise general in retreat calculating his chances\nand the power and speed of pursuers, and the moment for the last\ndesperate burst. No doubt, Card, with his life at stake, gloried in that\nrace, perhaps more wildly than Venters. For he had been born to the sage\nand the saddle and the wild. He was more than half horse. Not until the\nlast call--the sudden up-flashing instinct of self-preservation--would\nhe lose his skill and judgment and nerve and the spirit of that race.\nVenters seemed to read Jerry's mind. That little crime-stained rider was\nactually thinking of his horses, husbanding their speed, handling them\nwith knowledge of years, glorying in their beautiful, swift, racing\nstride, and wanting them to win the race when his own life hung\nsuspended in quivering balance. Again Jerry whirled in his saddle and\nthe sun flashed red on his face. Turning, he drew Black Star closer and\ncloser toward Night, till they ran side by side, as one horse. Then Card\nraised himself in the saddle, slipped out of the stirrups, and, somehow\ntwisting himself, leaped upon Black Star. He did not even lose the swing\nof the horse. Like a leech he was there in the other saddle, and as the\nhorses separated, his right foot, that had been apparently doubled under\nhim, shot down to catch the stirrup. The grace and dexterity and daring\nof that rider's act won something more than admiration from Venters.\n\nFor the distance of a mile Jerry rode Black Star and then changed back\nto Night. But all Jerry's skill and the running of the blacks could\navail little more against the sorrel.\n\nVenters peered far ahead, studying the lay of the land. Straightaway\nfor five miles the trail stretched, and then it disappeared in hummocky\nground. To the right, some few rods, Venters saw a break in the sage,\nand this was the rim of Deception Pass. Across the dark cleft gleamed\nthe red of the opposite wall. Venters imagined that the trail went down\ninto the Pass somewhere north of those ridges. And he realized that\nhe must and would overtake Jerry Card in this straight course of five\nmiles.\n\nCruelly he struck his spurs into Wrangle's flanks. A light touch of spur\nwas sufficient to make Wrangle plunge. And now, with a ringing, wild\nsnort, he seemed to double up in muscular convulsions and to shoot\nforward with an impetus that almost unseated Venters. The sage blurred\nby, the trail flashed by, and the wind robbed him of breath and hearing.\nJerry Card turned once more. And the way he shifted to Black Star showed\nhe had to make his last desperate running. Venters aimed to the side of\nthe trail and sent a bullet puffing the dust beyond Jerry. Venters\nhoped to frighten the rider and get him to take to the sage. But Jerry\nreturned the shot, and his ball struck dangerously close in the dust\nat Wrangle's flying feet. Venters held his fire then, while the rider\nemptied his revolver. For a mile, with Black Star leaving Night behind\nand doing his utmost, Wrangle did not gain; for another mile he gained\nlittle, if at all. In the third he caught up with the now galloping\nNight and began to gain rapidly on the other black.\n\nOnly a hundred yards now stretched between Black Star and Wrangle. The\ngiant sorrel thundered on--and on--and on. In every yard he gained\na foot. He was whistling through his nostrils, wringing wet, flying\nlather, and as hot as fire. Savage as ever, strong as ever, fast as\never, but each tremendous stride jarred Venters out of the saddle!\nWrangle's power and spirit and momentum had begun to run him off his\nlegs. Wrangle's great race was nearly won--and run. Venters seemed to\nsee the expanse before him as a vast, sheeted, purple plain sliding\nunder him. Black Star moved in it as a blur. The rider, Jerry Card,\nappeared a mere dot bobbing dimly. Wrangle thundered on--on--on! Venters\nfelt the increase in quivering, straining shock after every leap. Flecks\nof foam flew into Venters's eyes, burning him, making him see all the\nsage as red. But in that red haze he saw, or seemed to see, Black Star\nsuddenly riderless and with broken gait. Wrangle thundered on to change\nhis pace with a violent break. Then Venters pulled him hard. From run\nto gallop, gallop to canter, canter to trot, trot to walk, and walk to\nstop, the great sorrel ended his race.\n\nVenters looked back. Black Star stood riderless in the trail. Jerry\nCard had taken to the sage. Far up the white trail Night came trotting\nfaithfully down. Venters leaped off, still half blind, reeling dizzily.\nIn a moment he had recovered sufficiently to have a care for Wrangle.\nRapidly he took off the saddle and bridle. The sorrel was reeking,\nheaving, whistling, shaking. But he had still the strength to stand, and\nfor him Venters had no fears.\n\nAs Venters ran back to Black Star he saw the horse stagger on shaking\nlegs into the sage and go down in a heap. Upon reaching him Venters\nremoved the saddle and bridle. Black Star had been killed on his legs,\nVenters thought. He had no hope for the stricken horse. Black Star\nlay flat, covered with bloody froth, mouth wide, tongue hanging, eyes\nglaring, and all his beautiful body in convulsions.\n\nUnable to stay there to see Jane's favorite racer die, Venters hurried\nup the trail to meet the other black. On the way he kept a sharp lookout\nfor Jerry Card. Venters imagined the rider would keep well out of range\nof the rifle, but, as he would be lost on the sage without a horse, not\nimprobably he would linger in the vicinity on the chance of getting back\none of the blacks. Night soon came trotting up, hot and wet and run out.\nVenters led him down near the others, and unsaddling him, let him loose\nto rest. Night wearily lay down in the dust and rolled, proving himself\nnot yet spent.\n\nThen Venters sat down to rest and think. Whatever the risk, he was\ncompelled to stay where he was, or comparatively near, for the night.\nThe horses must rest and drink. He must find water. He was now seventy\nmiles from Cottonwoods, and, he believed, close to the canyon where the\ncattle trail must surely turn off and go down into the Pass. After a\nwhile he rose to survey the valley.\n\nHe was very near to the ragged edge of a deep canyon into which the\ntrail turned. The ground lay in uneven ridges divided by washes, and\nthese sloped into the canyon. Following the canyon line, he saw where\nits rim was broken by other intersecting canyons, and farther down red\nwalls and yellow cliffs leading toward a deep blue cleft that he made\nsure was Deception Pass. Walking out a few rods to a promontory, he\nfound where the trail went down. The descent was gradual, along a\nstone-walled trail, and Venters felt sure that this was the place where\nOldring drove cattle into the Pass. There was, however, no indication at\nall that he ever had driven cattle out at this point. Oldring had many\nholes to his burrow.\n\nIn searching round in the little hollows Venters, much to his relief,\nfound water. He composed himself to rest and eat some bread and meat,\nwhile he waited for a sufficient time to elapse so that he could safely\ngive the horses a drink. He judged the hour to be somewhere around noon.\nWrangle lay down to rest and Night followed suit. So long as they\nwere down Venters intended to make no move. The longer they rested\nthe better, and the safer it would be to give them water. By and by he\nforced himself to go over to where Black Star lay, expecting to find\nhim dead. Instead he found the racer partially if not wholly recovered.\nThere was recognition, even fire, in his big black eyes. Venters was\noverjoyed. He sat by the black for a long time. Black Star presently\nlabored to his feet with a heave and a groan, shook himself, and snorted\nfor water. Venters repaired to the little pool he had found, filled\nhis sombrero, and gave the racer a drink. Black Star gulped it at one\ndraught, as if it were but a drop, and pushed his nose into the hat\nand snorted for more. Venters now led Night down to drink, and after a\nfurther time Black Star also. Then the blacks began to graze.\n\nThe sorrel had wandered off down the sage between the trail and the\ncanyon. Once or twice he disappeared in little swales. Finally Venters\nconcluded Wrangle had grazed far enough, and, taking his lasso, he went\nto fetch him back. In crossing from one ridge to another he saw where\nthe horse had made muddy a pool of water. It occurred to Venters then\nthat Wrangle had drunk his fill, and did not seem the worse for it, and\nmight be anything but easy to catch. And, true enough, he could not come\nwithin roping reach of the sorrel. He tried for an hour, and gave up in\ndisgust. Wrangle did not seem so wild as simply perverse. In a quandary\nVenters returned to the other horses, hoping much, yet doubting more,\nthat when Wrangle had grazed to suit himself he might be caught.\n\nAs the afternoon wore away Venters's concern diminished, yet he kept\nclose watch on the blacks and the trail and the sage. There was no\ntelling of what Jerry Card might be capable. Venters sullenly acquiesced\nto the idea that the rider had been too quick and too shrewd for him.\nStrangely and doggedly, however, Venters clung to his foreboding of\nCard's downfall.\n\nThe wind died away; the red sun topped the far distant western rise of\nslope; and the long, creeping purple shadows lengthened. The rims of the\ncanyons gleamed crimson and the deep clefts appeared to belch forth blue\nsmoke. Silence enfolded the scene.\n\nIt was broken by a horrid, long-drawn scream of a horse and the thudding\nof heavy hoofs. Venters sprang erect and wheeled south. Along the canyon\nrim, near the edge, came Wrangle, once more in thundering flight.\n\nVenters gasped in amazement. Had the wild sorrel gone mad? His head\nwas high and twisted, in a most singular position for a running horse.\nSuddenly Venters descried a frog-like shape clinging to Wrangle's neck.\nJerry Card! Somehow he had straddled Wrangle and now stuck like a huge\nburr. But it was his strange position and the sorrel's wild scream that\nshook Venters's nerves. Wrangle was pounding toward the turn where the\ntrail went down. He plunged onward like a blind horse. More than one of\nhis leaps took him to the very edge of the precipice.\n\nJerry Card was bent forward with his teeth fast in the front of\nWrangle's nose! Venters saw it, and there flashed over him a memory of\nthis trick of a few desperate riders. He even thought of one rider\nwho had worn off his teeth in this terrible hold to break or control\ndesperate horses. Wrangle had indeed gone mad. The marvel was what\nguided him. Was it the half-brute, the more than half-horse instinct of\nJerry Card? Whatever the mystery, it was true. And in a few more rods\nJerry would have the sorrel turning into the trail leading down into the\ncanyon.\n\n\"No--Jerry!\" whispered Venters, stepping forward and throwing up the\nrifle. He tried to catch the little humped, frog-like shape over the\nsights. It was moving too fast; it was too small. Yet Venters shot\nonce... twice... the third time... four times... five! all wasted shots and\nprecious seconds!\n\nWith a deep-muttered curse Venters caught Wrangle through the sights and\npulled the trigger. Plainly he heard the bullet thud. Wrangle uttered\na horrible strangling sound. In swift death action he whirled, and\nwith one last splendid leap he cleared the canyon rim. And he whirled\ndownward with the little frog-like shape clinging to his neck!\n\nThere was a pause which seemed never ending, a shock, and an instant's\nsilence.\n\nThen up rolled a heavy crash, a long roar of sliding rocks dying away in\ndistant echo, then silence unbroken.\n\nWrangle's race was run.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. OLDRING'S KNELL\n\nSome forty hours or more later Venters created a commotion in\nCottonwoods by riding down the main street on Black Star and leading\nBells and Night. He had come upon Bells grazing near the body of a dead\nrustler, the only incident of his quick ride into the village.\n\nNothing was farther from Venters's mind than bravado. No thought came\nto him of the defiance and boldness of riding Jane Withersteen's racers\nstraight into the arch-plotter's stronghold. He wanted men to see the\nfamous Arabians; he wanted men to see them dirty and dusty, bearing all\nthe signs of having been driven to their limit; he wanted men to see and\nto know that the thieves who had ridden them out into the sage had not\nridden them back. Venters had come for that and for more--he wanted to\nmeet Tull face to face; if not Tull, then Dyer; if not Dyer, then anyone\nin the secret of these master conspirators. Such was Venters's passion.\nThe meeting with the rustlers, the unprovoked attack upon him, the\nspilling of blood, the recognition of Jerry Card and the horses, the\nrace, and that last plunge of mad Wrangle--all these things, fuel on\nfuel to the smoldering fire, had kindled and swelled and leaped into\nliving flame. He could have shot Dyer in the midst of his religious\nservices at the altar; he could have killed Tull in front of wives and\nbabes.\n\nHe walked the three racers down the broad, green-bordered village road.\nHe heard the murmur of running water from Amber Spring. Bitter waters\nfor Jane Withersteen! Men and women stopped to gaze at him and the\nhorses. All knew him; all knew the blacks and the bay. As well as if it\nhad been spoken, Venters read in the faces of men the intelligence that\nJane Withersteen's Arabians had been known to have been stolen. Venters\nreined in and halted before Dyer's residence. It was a low, long, stone\nstructure resembling Withersteen House. The spacious front yard was\ngreen and luxuriant with grass and flowers; gravel walks led to the huge\nporch; a well-trimmed hedge of purple sage separated the yard from the\nchurch grounds; birds sang in the trees; water flowed musically along\nthe walks; and there were glad, careless shouts of children. For Venters\nthe beauty of this home, and the serenity and its apparent happiness,\nall turned red and black. For Venters a shade overspread the lawn, the\nflowers, the old vine-clad stone house. In the music of the singing\nbirds, in the murmur of the running water, he heard an ominous sound.\nQuiet beauty--sweet music--innocent laughter! By what monstrous abortion\nof fate did these abide in the shadow of Dyer?\n\nVenters rode on and stopped before Tull's cottage. Women stared at him\nwith white faces and then flew from the porch. Tull himself appeared\nat the door, bent low, craning his neck. His dark face flashed out of\nsight; the door banged; a heavy bar dropped with a hollow sound.\n\nThen Venters shook Black Star's bridle, and, sharply trotting, led the\nother horses to the center of the village. Here at the intersecting\nstreets and in front of the stores he halted once more. The usual\nlounging atmosphere of that prominent corner was not now in evidence.\nRiders and ranchers and villagers broke up what must have been absorbing\nconversation. There was a rush of many feet, and then the walk was lined\nwith faces.\n\nVenters's glance swept down the line of silent stone-faced men. He\nrecognized many riders and villagers, but none of those he had hoped\nto meet. There was no expression in the faces turned toward him. All\nof them knew him, most were inimical, but there were few who were\nnot burning with curiosity and wonder in regard to the return of Jane\nWithersteen's racers. Yet all were silent. Here were the familiar\ncharacteristics--masked feeling--strange secretiveness--expressionless\nexpression of mystery and hidden power.\n\n\"Has anybody here seen Jerry Card?\" queried Venters, in a loud voice.\n\nIn reply there came not a word, not a nod or shake of head, not so much\nas dropping eye or twitching lip--nothing but a quiet, stony stare.\n\n\"Been under the knife? You've a fine knife-wielder here--one Tull, I\nbelieve!... Maybe you've all had your tongues cut out?\"\n\nThis passionate sarcasm of Venters brought no response, and the stony\ncalm was as oil on the fire within him.\n\n\"I see some of you pack guns, too!\" he added, in biting scorn. In the\nlong, tense pause, strung keenly as a tight wire, he sat motionless on\nBlack Star. \"All right,\" he went on. \"Then let some of you take this\nmessage to Tull. Tell him I've seen Jerry Card! ... Tell him Jerry Card\nwill never return!\"\n\nThereupon, in the same dead calm, Venters backed Black Star away from\nthe curb, into the street, and out of range. He was ready now to ride up\nto Withersteen House and turn the racers over to Jane.\n\n\"Hello, Venters!\" a familiar voice cried, hoarsely, and he saw a man\nrunning toward him. It was the rider Judkins who came up and gripped\nVenters's hand. \"Venters, I could hev dropped when I seen them hosses.\nBut thet sight ain't a marker to the looks of you. What's wrong? Hev\nyou gone crazy? You must be crazy to ride in here this way--with them\nhosses--talkie' thet way about Tull en' Jerry Card.\"\n\n\"Jud, I'm not crazy--only mad clean through,\" replied Venters.\n\n\"Mad, now, Bern, I'm glad to hear some of your old self in your voice.\nFer when you come up you looked like the corpse of a dead rider with\nfire fer eyes. You hed thet crowd too stiff fer throwin' guns. Come,\nwe've got to hev a talk. Let's go up the lane. We ain't much safe here.\"\n\nJudkins mounted Bells and rode with Venters up to the cottonwood grove.\nHere they dismounted and went among the trees.\n\n\"Let's hear from you first,\" said Judkins. \"You fetched back them\nhosses. Thet is the trick. An', of course, you got Jerry the same as you\ngot Horne.\"\n\n\"Horne!\"\n\n\"Sure. He was found dead yesterday all chewed by coyotes, en' he'd been\nshot plumb center.\"\n\n\"Where was he found?\"\n\n\"At the split down the trail--you know where Oldring's cattle trail runs\noff north from the trail to the pass.\"\n\n\"That's where I met Jerry and the rustlers. What was Horne doing with\nthem? I thought Horne was an honest cattle-man.\"\n\n\"Lord--Bern, don't ask me thet! I'm all muddled now tryin' to figure\nthings.\"\n\nVenters told of the fight and the race with Jerry Card and its tragic\nconclusion.\n\n\"I knowed it! I knowed all along that Wrangle was the best hoss!\"\nexclaimed Judkins, with his lean face working and his eyes lighting.\n\"Thet was a race! Lord, I'd like to hev seen Wrangle jump the cliff with\nJerry. An' thet was good-by to the grandest hoss an' rider ever on the\nsage!... But, Bern, after you got the hosses why'd you want to bolt right\nin Tull's face?\"\n\n\"I want him to know. An' if I can get to him I'll--\"\n\n\"You can't get near Tull,\" interrupted Judkins. \"Thet vigilante bunch\nhev taken to bein' bodyguard for Tull an' Dyer, too.\"\n\n\"Hasn't Lassiter made a break yet?\" inquired Venters, curiously.\n\n\"Naw!\" replied Judkins, scornfully. \"Jane turned his head. He's mad in\nlove over her--follers her like a dog. He ain't no more Lassiter! He's\nlost his nerve, he doesn't look like the same feller. It's village talk.\nEverybody knows it. He hasn't thrown a gun, an' he won't!\"\n\n\"Jud, I'll bet he does,\" replied Venters, earnestly. \"Remember what I\nsay. This Lassiter is something more than a gun-man. Jud, he's big--he's\ngreat!... I feel that in him. God help Tull and Dyer when Lassiter does\ngo after them. For horses and riders and stone walls won't save them.\"\n\n\"Wal, hev it your way, Bern. I hope you're right. Nat'rully I've been\nsome sore on Lassiter fer gittin' soft. But I ain't denyin' his nerve,\nor whatever's great in him thet sort of paralyzes people. No later 'n\nthis mornin' I seen him saunterin' down the lane, quiet an' slow. An'\nlike his guns he comes black--black, thet's Lassiter. Wal, the crowd\non the corner never batted an eye, en' I'll gamble my hoss thet there\nwasn't one who hed a heartbeat till Lassiter got by. He went in Snell's\nsaloon, an' as there wasn't no gun play I had to go in, too. An' there,\ndarn my pictures, if Lassiter wasn't standin' to the bar, drinking en'\ntalkin' with Oldrin'.\"\n\n\"Oldring!\" whispered Venters. His voice, as all fire and pulse within\nhim, seemed to freeze.\n\n\"Let go my arm!\" exclaimed Judkins. \"Thet's my bad arm. Sure it was\nOldrin'. What the hell's wrong with you, anyway? Venters, I tell you\nsomethin's wrong. You're whiter 'n a sheet. You can't be scared of the\nrustler. I don't believe you've got a scare in you. Wal, now, jest let\nme talk. You know I like to talk, an' if I'm slow I allus git there\nsometime. As I said, Lassiter was talkie' chummy with Oldrin'. There\nwasn't no hard feelin's. An' the gang wasn't payin' no pertic'lar\nattention. But like a cat watchin' a mouse I hed my eyes on them two\nfellers. It was strange to me, thet confab. I'm gittin' to think a lot,\nfer a feller who doesn't know much. There's been some queer deals lately\nan' this seemed to me the queerest. These men stood to the bar alone,\nan' so close their big gun-hilts butted together. I seen Oldrin' was\nsome surprised at first, an' Lassiter was cool as ice. They talked, an'\npresently at somethin' Lassiter said the rustler bawled out a curse, an'\nthen he jest fell up against the bar, an' sagged there. The gang in the\nsaloon looked around an' laughed, an' thet's about all. Finally Oldrin'\nturned, and it was easy to see somethin' hed shook him. Yes, sir, thet\nbig rustler--you know he's as broad as he is long, an' the powerfulest\nbuild of a man--yes, sir, the nerve had been taken out of him. Then,\nafter a little, he began to talk an' said a lot to Lassiter, an' by an'\nby it didn't take much of an eye to see thet Lassiter was gittin' hit\nhard. I never seen him anyway but cooler 'n ice--till then. He seemed to\nbe hit harder 'n Oldrin', only he didn't roar out thet way. He jest kind\nof sunk in, an' looked an' looked, an' he didn't see a livin' soul\nin thet saloon. Then he sort of come to, an' shakin' hands--mind you,\nshakin' hands with Oldrin'--he went out. I couldn't help thinkin' how\neasy even a boy could hev dropped the great gun-man then!... Wal, the\nrustler stood at the bar fer a long time, en' he was seein' things far\noff, too; then he come to an' roared fer whisky, an' gulped a drink thet\nwas big enough to drown me.\"\n\n\"Is Oldring here now?\" whispered Venters. He could not speak above a\nwhisper. Judkins's story had been meaningless to him.\n\n\"He's at Snell's yet. Bern, I hevn't told you yet thet the rustlers hev\nbeen raisin' hell. They shot up Stone Bridge an' Glaze, an' fer three\ndays they've been here drinkin' an' gamblin' an' throwin' of gold. These\nrustlers hev a pile of gold. If it was gold dust or nugget gold I'd hev\nreason to think, but it's new coin gold, as if it had jest come from the\nUnited States treasury. An' the coin's genuine. Thet's all been proved.\nThe truth is Oldrin's on a rampage. A while back he lost his Masked\nRider, an' they say he's wild about thet. I'm wonderin' if Lassiter\ncould hev told the rustler anythin' about thet little masked,\nhard-ridin' devil. Ride! He was most as good as Jerry Card. An', Bern,\nI've been wonderin' if you know--\"\n\n\"Judkins, you're a good fellow,\" interrupted Venters. \"Some day I'll\ntell you a story. I've no time now. Take the horses to Jane.\"\n\nJudkins stared, and then, muttering to himself, he mounted Bells, and\nstared again at Venters, and then, leading the other horses, he rode\ninto the grove and disappeared.\n\nOnce, long before, on the night Venters had carried Bess through the\ncanyon and up into Surprise Valley, he had experienced the strangeness\nof faculties singularly, tinglingly acute. And now the same sensation\nrecurred. But it was different in that he felt cold, frozen, mechanical\nincapable of free thought, and all about him seemed unreal, aloof,\nremote. He hid his rifle in the sage, marking its exact location with\nextreme care. Then he faced down the lane and strode toward the center\nof the village. Perceptions flashed upon him, the faint, cold touch of\nthe breeze, a cold, silvery tinkle of flowing water, a cold sun shining\nout of a cold sky, song of birds and laugh of children, coldly distant.\nCold and intangible were all things in earth and heaven. Colder and\ntighter stretched the skin over his face; colder and harder grew the\npolished butts of his guns; colder and steadier became his hands as he\nwiped the clammy sweat from his face or reached low to his gun-sheaths.\nMen meeting him in the walk gave him wide berth. In front of Bevin's\nstore a crowd melted apart for his passage, and their faces and whispers\nwere faces and whispers of a dream. He turned a corner to meet Tull\nface to face, eye to eye. As once before he had seen this man pale to\na ghastly, livid white so again he saw the change. Tull stopped in his\ntracks, with right hand raised and shaking. Suddenly it dropped, and he\nseemed to glide aside, to pass out of Venters's sight. Next he saw\nmany horses with bridles down--all clean-limbed, dark bays or\nblacks--rustlers' horses! Loud voices and boisterous laughter, rattle of\ndice and scrape of chair and clink of gold, burst in mingled din from an\nopen doorway. He stepped inside.\n\nWith the sight of smoke-hazed room and drinking, cursing, gambling,\ndark-visaged men, reality once more dawned upon Venters.\n\nHis entrance had been unnoticed, and he bent his gaze upon the drinkers\nat the bar. Dark-clothed, dark-faced men they all were, burned by the\nsun, bow-legged as were most riders of the sage, but neither lean nor\ngaunt. Then Venters's gaze passed to the tables, and swiftly it swept\nover the hard-featured gamesters, to alight upon the huge, shaggy, black\nhead of the rustler chief.\n\n\"Oldring!\" he cried, and to him his voice seemed to split a bell in his\nears.\n\nIt stilled the din.\n\nThat silence suddenly broke to the scrape and crash of Oldring's chair\nas he rose; and then, while he passed, a great gloomy figure, again the\nthronged room stilled in silence yet deeper.\n\n\"Oldring, a word with you!\" continued Venters.\n\n\"Ho! What's this?\" boomed Oldring, in frowning scrutiny.\n\n\"Come outside, alone. A word for you--from your Masked Rider!\"\n\nOldring kicked a chair out of his way and lunged forward with a stamp\nof heavy boot that jarred the floor. He waved down his muttering, rising\nmen.\n\nVenters backed out of the door and waited, hearing, as no sound had ever\nbefore struck into his soul, the rapid, heavy steps of the rustler.\n\nOldring appeared, and Venters had one glimpse of his great breadth and\nbulk, his gold-buckled belt with hanging guns, his high-top boots\nwith gold spurs. In that moment Venters had a strange, unintelligible\ncuriosity to see Oldring alive. The rustler's broad brow, his large\nblack eyes, his sweeping beard, as dark as the wing of a raven, his\nenormous width of shoulder and depth of chest, his whole splendid\npresence so wonderfully charged with vitality and force and strength,\nseemed to afford Venters an unutterable fiendish joy because for that\nmagnificent manhood and life he meant cold and sudden death.\n\n\"Oldring, Bess is alive! But she's dead to you--dead to the life you\nmade her lead--dead as you will be in one second!\"\n\nSwift as lightning Venters's glance dropped from Oldring's rolling\neyes to his hands. One of them, the right, swept out, then toward his\ngun--and Venters shot him through the heart.\n\nSlowly Oldring sank to his knees, and the hand, dragging at the gun,\nfell away. Venters's strangely acute faculties grasped the meaning\nof that limp arm, of the swaying hulk, of the gasp and heave, of the\nquivering beard. But was that awful spirit in the black eyes only one of\nvitality?\n\n\"Man--why--didn't--you--wait? Bess--was--\" Oldring's whisper died under\nhis beard, and with a heavy lurch he fell forward.\n\nBounding swiftly away, Venters fled around the corner, across the\nstreet, and, leaping a hedge, he ran through yard, orchard, and garden\nto the sage. Here, under cover of the tall brush, he turned west and ran\non to the place where he had hidden his rifle. Securing that, he again\nset out into a run, and, circling through the sage, came up behind Jane\nWithersteen's stable and corrals. With laboring, dripping chest, and\npain as of a knife thrust in his side, he stopped to regain his breath,\nand while resting his eyes roved around in search of a horse. Doors\nand windows of the stable were open wide and had a deserted look. One\ndejected, lonely burro stood in the near corral. Strange indeed was the\nsilence brooding over the once happy, noisy home of Jane Withersteen's\npets.\n\nHe went into the corral, exercising care to leave no tracks, and led the\nburro to the watering-trough. Venters, though not thirsty, drank till he\ncould drink no more. Then, leading the burro over hard ground, he struck\ninto the sage and down the slope.\n\nHe strode swiftly, turning from time to time to scan the slope for\nriders. His head just topped the level of sage-brush, and the burro\ncould not have been seen at all. Slowly the green of Cottonwoods sank\nbehind the slope, and at last a wavering line of purple sage met the\nblue of sky.\n\nTo avoid being seen, to get away, to hide his trail--these were the sole\nideas in his mind as he headed for Deception Pass, and he directed all\nhis acuteness of eye and ear, and the keenness of a rider's judgment for\ndistance and ground, to stern accomplishment of the task. He kept to the\nsage far to the left of the trail leading into the Pass. He walked ten\nmiles and looked back a thousand times. Always the graceful, purple wave\nof sage remained wide and lonely, a clear, undotted waste. Coming to a\nstretch of rocky ground, he took advantage of it to cross the trail and\nthen continued down on the right. At length he persuaded himself that he\nwould be able to see riders mounted on horses before they could see him\non the little burro, and he rode bareback.\n\nHour by hour the tireless burro kept to his faithful, steady trot. The\nsun sank and the long shadows lengthened down the slope. Moving veils of\npurple twilight crept out of the hollows and, mustering and forming on\nthe levels, soon merged and shaded into night. Venters guided the\nburro nearer to the trail, so that he could see its white line from the\nridges, and rode on through the hours.\n\nOnce down in the Pass without leaving a trail, he would hold himself\nsafe for the time being. When late in the night he reached the break in\nthe sage, he sent the burro down ahead of him, and started an avalanche\nthat all but buried the animal at the bottom of the trail. Bruised and\nbattered as he was, he had a moment's elation, for he had hidden his\ntracks. Once more he mounted the burro and rode on. The hour was the\nblackest of the night when he made the thicket which inclosed his old\ncamp. Here he turned the burro loose in the grass near the spring, and\nthen lay down on his old bed of leaves.\n\nHe felt only vaguely, as outside things, the ache and burn and throb\nof the muscles of his body. But a dammed-up torrent of emotion at last\nburst its bounds, and the hour that saw his release from immediate\naction was one that confounded him in the reaction of his spirit. He\nsuffered without understanding why. He caught glimpses into himself,\ninto unlit darkness of soul. The fire that had blistered him and the\ncold which had frozen him now united in one torturing possession of his\nmind and heart, and like a fiery steed with ice-shod feet, ranged his\nbeing, ran rioting through his blood, trampling the resurging good,\ndragging ever at the evil.\n\nOut of the subsiding chaos came a clear question. What had happened?\nHe had left the valley to go to Cottonwoods. Why? It seemed that he had\ngone to kill a man--Oldring! The name riveted his consciousness upon the\none man of all men upon earth whom he had wanted to meet. He had met the\nrustler. Venters recalled the smoky haze of the saloon, the dark-visaged\nmen, the huge Oldring. He saw him step out of the door, a splendid\nspecimen of manhood, a handsome giant with purple-black and sweeping\nbeard. He remembered inquisitive gaze of falcon eyes. He heard himself\nrepeating: \"OLDRING, BESS IS ALIVE! BUT SHE'S DEAD TO YOU,\" and he felt\nhimself jerk, and his ears throbbed to the thunder of a gun, and he\nsaw the giant sink slowly to his knees. Was that only the vitality\nof him--that awful light in the eyes--only the hard-dying life of\na tremendously powerful brute? A broken whisper, strange as death:\n\"MAN--WHY--DIDN'T--YOU WAIT! BESS--WAS--\" And Oldring plunged face\nforward, dead.\n\n\"I killed him,\" cried Venters, in remembering shock. \"But it wasn't\nTHAT. Ah, the look in his eyes and his whisper!\"\n\nHerein lay the secret that had clamored to him through all the tumult\nand stress of his emotions. What a look in the eyes of a man shot\nthrough the heart! It had been neither hate nor ferocity nor fear of\nmen nor fear of death. It had been no passionate glinting spirit of a\nfearless foe, willing shot for shot, life for life, but lacking physical\npower. Distinctly recalled now, never to be forgotten, Venters saw\nin Oldring's magnificent eyes the rolling of great, glad\nsurprise--softness--love! Then came a shadow and the terrible superhuman\nstriving of his spirit to speak. Oldring shot through the heart, had\nfought and forced back death, not for a moment in which to shoot or\ncurse, but to whisper strange words.\n\nWhat words for a dying man to whisper! Why had not Venters waited? For\nwhat? That was no plea for life. It was regret that there was not a\nmoment of life left in which to speak. Bess was--Herein lay renewed\ntorture for Venters. What had Bess been to Oldring? The old question,\nlike a specter, stalked from its grave to haunt him. He had overlooked,\nhe had forgiven, he had loved and he had forgotten; and now, out of the\nmystery of a dying man's whisper rose again that perverse, unsatisfied,\njealous uncertainty. Bess had loved that splendid, black-crowned\ngiant--by her own confession she had loved him; and in Venters's soul\nagain flamed up the jealous hell. Then into the clamoring hell burst the\nshot that had killed Oldring, and it rang in a wild fiendish gladness,\na hateful, vengeful joy. That passed to the memory of the love and\nlight in Oldring's eyes and the mystery in his whisper. So the changing,\nswaying emotions fluctuated in Venters's heart.\n\nThis was the climax of his year of suffering and the crucial struggle\nof his life. And when the gray dawn came he rose, a gloomy, almost\nheartbroken man, but victor over evil passions. He could not change the\npast; and, even if he had not loved Bess with all his soul, he had grown\ninto a man who would not change the future he had planned for her. Only,\nand once for all, he must know the truth, know the worst, stifle all\nthese insistent doubts and subtle hopes and jealous fancies, and kill\nthe past by knowing truly what Bess had been to Oldring. For that matter\nhe knew--he had always known, but he must hear it spoken. Then, when\nthey had safely gotten out of that wild country to take up a new and an\nabsorbing life, she would forget, she would be happy, and through that,\nin the years to come, he could not but find life worth living.\n\nAll day he rode slowly and cautiously up the Pass, taking time to peer\naround corners, to pick out hard ground and grassy patches, and to make\nsure there was no one in pursuit. In the night sometime he came to the\nsmooth, scrawled rocks dividing the valley, and here set the burro at\nliberty. He walked beyond, climbed the slope and the dim, starlit gorge.\nThen, weary to the point of exhaustion, he crept into a shallow cave and\nfell asleep.\n\nIn the morning, when he descended the trail, he found the sun was\npouring a golden stream of light through the arch of the great stone\nbridge. Surprise Valley, like a valley of dreams, lay mystically soft\nand beautiful, awakening to the golden flood which was rolling away its\nslumberous bands of mist, brightening its walled faces.\n\nWhile yet far off he discerned Bess moving under the silver spruces, and\nsoon the barking of the dogs told him that they had seen him. He heard\nthe mocking-birds singing in the trees, and then the twittering of the\nquail. Ring and Whitie came bounding toward him, and behind them ran\nBess, her hands outstretched.\n\n\"Bern! You're back! You're back!\" she cried, in joy that rang of her\nloneliness.\n\n\"Yes, I'm back,\" he said, as she rushed to meet him.\n\nShe had reached out for him when suddenly, as she saw him closely,\nsomething checked her, and as quickly all her joy fled, and with it her\ncolor, leaving her pale and trembling.\n\n\"Oh! What's happened?\"\n\n\"A good deal has happened, Bess. I don't need to tell you what. And I'm\nplayed out. Worn out in mind more than body.\"\n\n\"Dear--you look strange to me!\" faltered Bess.\n\n\"Never mind that. I'm all right. There's nothing for you to be scared\nabout. Things are going to turn out just as we have planned. As soon as\nI'm rested we'll make a break to get out of the country. Only now, right\nnow, I must know the truth about you.\"\n\n\"Truth about me?\" echoed Bess, shrinkingly. She seemed to be casting\nback into her mind for a forgotten key. Venters himself, as he saw her,\nreceived a pang.\n\n\"Yes--the truth. Bess, don't misunderstand. I haven't changed that way.\nI love you still. I'll love you more afterward. Life will be just as\nsweet--sweeter to us. We'll be--be married as soon as ever we can. We'll\nbe happy--but there's a devil in me. A perverse, jealous devil! Then\nI've queer fancies. I forgot for a long time. Now all those fiendish\nlittle whispers of doubt and faith and fear and hope come torturing me\nagain. I've got to kill them with the truth.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you anything you want to know,\" she replied, frankly.\n\n\"Then by Heaven! we'll have it over and done with!... Bess--did Oldring\nlove you?\"\n\n\"Certainly he did.\"\n\n\"Did--did you love him?\"\n\n\"Of course. I told you so.\"\n\n\"How can you tell it so lightly?\" cried Venters, passionately. \"Haven't\nyou any sense of--of--\" He choked back speech. He felt the rush of pain\nand passion. He seized her in rude, strong hands and drew her close. He\nlooked straight into her dark-blue eyes. They were shadowing with the\nold wistful light, but they were as clear as the limpid water of the\nspring. They were earnest, solemn in unutterable love and faith and\nabnegation. Venters shivered. He knew he was looking into her soul.\nHe knew she could not lie in that moment; but that she might tell the\ntruth, looking at him with those eyes, almost killed his belief in\npurity.\n\n\"What are--what were you to--to Oldring?\" he panted, fiercely.\n\n\"I am his daughter,\" she replied, instantly.\n\nVenters slowly let go of her. There was a violent break in the force of\nhis feeling--then creeping blankness.\n\n\"What--was it--you said?\" he asked, in a kind of dull wonder.\n\n\"I am his daughter.\"\n\n\"Oldring's daughter?\" queried Venters, with life gathering in his voice.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith a passionately awakening start he grasped her hands and drew her\nclose.\n\n\"All the time--you've been Oldring's daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course all the time--always.\"\n\n\"But Bess, you told me--you let me think--I made out you were--a--so--so\nashamed.\"\n\n\"It is my shame,\" she said, with voice deep and full, and now the\nscarlet fired her cheek. \"I told you--I'm nothing--nameless--just Bess,\nOldring's girl!\"\n\n\"I know--I remember. But I never thought--\" he went on, hurriedly,\nhuskily. \"That time--when you lay dying--you prayed--you--somehow I got\nthe idea you were bad.\"\n\n\"Bad?\" she asked, with a little laugh.\n\nShe looked up with a faint smile of bewilderment and the absolute\nunconsciousness of a child. Venters gasped in the gathering might of the\ntruth. She did not understand his meaning.\n\n\"Bess! Bess!\" He clasped her in his arms, hiding her eyes against his\nbreast. She must not see his face in that moment. And he held her while\nhe looked out across the valley. In his dim and blinded sight, in\nthe blur of golden light and moving mist, he saw Oldring. She was the\nrustler's nameless daughter. Oldring had loved her. He had so guarded\nher, so kept her from women and men and knowledge of life that her mind\nwas as a child's. That was part of the secret--part of the mystery.\nThat was the wonderful truth. Not only was she not bad, but good, pure,\ninnocent above all innocence in the world--the innocence of lonely\ngirlhood.\n\nHe saw Oldring's magnificent eyes, inquisitive, searching, softening. He\nsaw them flare in amaze, in gladness, with love, then suddenly strain in\nterrible effort of will. He heard Oldring whisper and saw him sway like\na log and fall. Then a million bellowing, thundering voices--gunshots of\nconscience, thunderbolts of remorse--dinned horribly in his ears. He had\nkilled Bess's father. Then a rushing wind filled his ears like a moan of\nwind in the cliffs, a knell indeed--Oldring's knell.\n\nHe dropped to his knees and hid his face against Bess, and grasped her\nwith the hands of a drowning man.\n\n\"My God!... My God!... Oh, Bess!... Forgive me! Never mind what I've\ndone--what I've thought. But forgive me. I'll give you my life. I'll\nlive for you. I'll love you. Oh, I do love you as no man ever loved\na woman. I want you to know--to remember that I fought a fight for\nyou--however blind I was. I thought--I thought--never mind what I\nthought--but I loved you--I asked you to marry me. Let that--let me have\nthat to hug to my heart. Oh, Bess, I was driven! And I might have known!\nI could not rest nor sleep till I had this mystery solved. God! how\nthings work out!\"\n\n\"Bern, you're weak--trembling--you talk wildly,\" cried Bess. \"You've\noverdone your strength. There's nothing to forgive. There's no mystery\nexcept your love for me. You have come back to me!\"\n\nAnd she clasped his head tenderly in her arms and pressed it closely to\nher throbbing breast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. FAY\n\nAt the home of Jane Withersteen Little Fay was climbing Lassiter's knee.\n\n\"Does oo love me?\" she asked.\n\nLassiter, who was as serious with Fay as he was gentle and loving,\nassured her in earnest and elaborate speech that he was her devoted\nsubject. Fay looked thoughtful and appeared to be debating the duplicity\nof men or searching for a supreme test to prove this cavalier.\n\n\"Does oo love my new muvver?\" she asked, with bewildering suddenness.\n\nJane Withersteen laughed, and for the first time in many a day she felt\na stir of her pulse and warmth in her cheek.\n\nIt was a still drowsy summer of afternoon, and the three were sitting\nin the shade of the wooded knoll that faced the sage-slope. Little Fay's\nbrief spell of unhappy longing for her mother--the childish, mystic\ngloom--had passed, and now where Fay was there were prattle and laughter\nand glee. She had emerged from sorrow to be the incarnation of joy and\nloveliness. She had grown supernaturally sweet and beautiful. For Jane\nWithersteen the child was an answer to prayer, a blessing, a possession\ninfinitely more precious than all she had lost. For Lassiter, Jane\ndivined that little Fay had become a religion.\n\n\"Does oo love my new muvver?\" repeated Fay.\n\nLassiter's answer to this was a modest and sincere affirmative.\n\n\"Why don't oo marry my new muvver an' be my favver?\"\n\nOf the thousands of questions put by little Fay to Lassiter this was the\nfirst he had been unable to answer.\n\n\"Fay--Fay, don't ask questions like that,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" replied Jane. And she found it strangely embarrassing to meet\nthe child's gaze. It seemed to her that Fay's violet eyes looked through\nher with piercing wisdom.\n\n\"Oo love him, don't oo?\"\n\n\"Dear child--run and play,\" said Jane, \"but don't go too far. Don't go\nfrom this little hill.\"\n\nFay pranced off wildly, joyous over freedom that had not been granted\nher for weeks.\n\n\"Jane, why are children more sincere than grown-up persons?\" asked\nLassiter.\n\n\"Are they?\"\n\n\"I reckon so. Little Fay there--she sees things as they appear on the\nface. An Indian does that. So does a dog. An' an Indian an' a dog are\nmost of the time right in what they see. Mebbe a child is always right.\"\n\n\"Well, what does Fay see?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"I reckon you know. I wonder what goes on in Fay's mind when she sees\npart of the truth with the wise eyes of a child, an' wantin' to know\nmore, meets with strange falseness from you? Wait! You are false in a\nway, though you're the best woman I ever knew. What I want to say is\nthis. Fay has taken you're pretendin' to--to care for me for the thing\nit looks on the face. An' her little formin' mind asks questions. An'\nthe answers she gets are different from the looks of things. So she'll\ngrow up gradually takin' on that falseness, an' be like the rest of the\nwomen, an' men, too. An' the truth of this falseness to life is proved\nby your appearin' to love me when you don't. Things aren't what they\nseem.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, you're right. A child should be told the absolute truth.\nBut--is that possible? I haven't been able to do it, and all my life\nI've loved the truth, and I've prided myself upon being truthful. Maybe\nthat was only egotism. I'm learning much, my friend. Some of those\nblinding scales have fallen from my eyes. And--and as to caring for you,\nI think I care a great deal. How much, how little, I couldn't say. My\nheart is almost broken, Lassiter. So now is not a good time to judge of\naffection. I can still play and be merry with Fay. I can still dream.\nBut when I attempt serious thought I'm dazed. I don't think. I don't\ncare any more. I don't pray!... Think of that, my friend! But in spite of\nmy numb feeling I believe I'll rise out of all this dark agony a better\nwoman, with greater love of man and God. I'm on the rack now; I'm\nsenseless to all but pain, and growing dead to that. Sooner or later I\nshall rise out of this stupor. I'm waiting the hour.\"\n\n\"It'll soon come, Jane,\" replied Lassiter, soberly. \"Then I'm afraid for\nyou. Years are terrible things, an' for years you've been bound.\nHabit of years is strong as life itself. Somehow, though, I believe as\nyou--that you'll come out of it all a finer woman. I'm waitin', too. An'\nI'm wonderin'--I reckon, Jane, that marriage between us is out of all\nhuman reason?\"\n\n\"Lassiter!... My dear friend!... It's impossible for us to marry!\"\n\n\"Why--as Fay says?\" inquired Lassiter, with gentle persistence.\n\n\"Why! I never thought why. But it's not possible. I am Jane, daughter of\nWithersteen. My father would rise out of his grave. I'm of Mormon\nbirth. I'm being broken. But I'm still a Mormon woman. And you--you are\nLassiter!\"\n\n\"Mebbe I'm not so much Lassiter as I used to be.\"\n\n\"What was it you said? Habit of years is strong as life itself! You\ncan't change the one habit--the purpose of your life. For you still pack\nthose black guns! You still nurse your passion for blood.\"\n\nA smile, like a shadow, flickered across his face.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, I lied to you. But I beg of you--don't you lie to me. I've\ngreat respect for you. I believe you're softened toward most, perhaps\nall, my people except--But when I speak of your purpose, your hate, your\nguns, I have only him in mind. I don't believe you've changed.\"\n\nFor answer he unbuckled the heavy cartridge-belt, and laid it with the\nheavy, swing gun-sheaths in her lap.\n\n\"Lassiter!\" Jane whispered, as she gazed from him to the black, cold\nguns. Without them he appeared shorn of strength, defenseless, a smaller\nman. Was she Delilah? Swiftly, conscious of only one motive--refusal to\nsee this man called craven by his enemies--she rose, and with blundering\nfingers buckled the belt round his waist where it belonged.\n\n\"Lassiter, I am a coward.\"\n\n\"Come with me out of Utah--where I can put away my guns an' be a man,\"\nhe said. \"I reckon I'll prove it to you then! Come! You've got Black\nStar back, an' Night an' Bells. Let's take the racers an' little Fay,\nen' race out of Utah. The hosses an' the child are all you have left.\nCome!\"\n\n\"No, no, Lassiter. I'll never leave Utah. What would I do in the world\nwith my broken fortunes and my broken heart? I'll never leave these\npurple slopes I love so well.\"\n\n\"I reckon I ought to 've knowed that. Presently you'll be livin' down\nhere in a hovel, en' presently Jane Withersteen will be a memory. I only\nwanted to have a chance to show you how a man--any man--can be better 'n\nhe was. If we left Utah I could prove--I reckon I could prove this\nthing you call love. It's strange, an' hell an' heaven at once, Jane\nWithersteen. 'Pears to me that you've thrown away your big heart on\nlove--love of religion an' duty an' churchmen, an' riders an' poor\nfamilies an' poor children! Yet you can't see what love is--how it\nchanges a person!... Listen, an' in tellin' you Milly Erne's story I'll\nshow you how love changed her.\n\n\"Milly an' me was children when our family moved from Missouri to Texas,\nan' we growed up in Texas ways same as if we'd been born there. We had\nbeen poor, an' there we prospered. In time the little village where we\nwent became a town, an' strangers an' new families kept movin' in. Milly\nwas the belle them days. I can see her now, a little girl no bigger 'n\na bird, an' as pretty. She had the finest eyes, dark blue-black when she\nwas excited, an' beautiful all the time. You remember Milly's eyes! An'\nshe had light-brown hair with streaks of gold, an' a mouth that every\nfeller wanted to kiss.\n\n\"An' about the time Milly was the prettiest an' the sweetest, along came\na young minister who began to ride some of a race with the other fellers\nfor Milly. An' he won. Milly had always been strong on religion, an'\nwhen she met Frank Erne she went in heart an' soul for the salvation of\nsouls. Fact was, Milly, through study of the Bible an' attendin' church\nan' revivals, went a little out of her head. It didn't worry the old\nfolks none, an' the only worry to me was Milly's everlastin' prayin' an'\nworkin' to save my soul. She never converted me, but we was the best\nof comrades, an' I reckon no brother an' sister ever loved each other\nbetter. Well, Frank Erne an me hit up a great friendship. He was a\nstrappin' feller, good to look at, an' had the most pleasin' ways. His\nreligion never bothered me, for he could hunt an' fish an' ride an' be a\ngood feller. After buffalo once, he come pretty near to savin' my life.\nWe got to be thick as brothers, an' he was the only man I ever seen who\nI thought was good enough for Milly. An' the day they were married I got\ndrunk for the only time in my life.\n\n\"Soon after that I left home--it seems Milly was the only one who could\nkeep me home--an' I went to the bad, as to prosperin' I saw some pretty\nhard life in the Pan Handle, an' then I went North. In them days Kansas\nan' Nebraska was as bad, come to think of it, as these days right here\non the border of Utah. I got to be pretty handy with guns. An'\nthere wasn't many riders as could beat me ridin'. An' I can say all\nmodest-like that I never seen the white man who could track a hoss or a\nsteer or a man with me. Afore I knowed it two years slipped by, an' all\nat once I got homesick, en' purled a bridle south.\n\n\"Things at home had changed. I never got over that homecomin'. Mother\nwas dead an' in her grave. Father was a silent, broken man, killed\nalready on his feet. Frank Erne was a ghost of his old self, through\nwith workin', through with preachin', almost through with livin', an'\nMilly was gone!... It was a long time before I got the story. Father had\nno mind left, an' Frank Erne was afraid to talk. So I had to pick up\nwhet 'd happened from different people.\n\n\"It 'pears that soon after I left home another preacher come to the\nlittle town. An' he an' Frank become rivals. This feller was different\nfrom Frank. He preached some other kind of religion, and he was quick\nan' passionate, where Frank was slow an' mild. He went after people,\nwomen specially. In looks he couldn't compare to Frank Erne, but he had\npower over women. He had a voice, an' he talked an' talked an' preached\nan' preached. Milly fell under his influence.. She became mightily\ninterested in his religion. Frank had patience with her, as was his way,\nan' let her be as interested as she liked. All religions were devoted to\none God, he said, an' it wouldn't hurt Milly none to study a different\npoint of view. So the new preacher often called on Milly, an' sometimes\nin Frank's absence. Frank was a cattle-man between Sundays.\n\n\"Along about this time an incident come off that I couldn't get much\nlight on. A stranger come to town, an' was seen with the preacher. This\nstranger was a big man with an eye like blue ice, an' a beard of gold.\nHe had money, an' he 'peered a man of mystery, an' the town went to\nbuzzin' when he disappeared about the same time as a young woman\nknown to be mightily interested in the new preacher's religion. Then,\npresently, along comes a man from somewheres in Illinois, en' he up an'\nspots this preacher as a famous Mormon proselyter. That riled Frank Erne\nas nothin' ever before, an' from rivals they come to be bitter enemies.\nAn' it ended in Frank goin' to the meetin'-house where Milly\nwas listenin', en' before her en' everybody else he called that\npreacher--called him, well, almost as hard as Venters called Tull here\nsometime back. An' Frank followed up that call with a hosswhippin', en'\nhe drove the proselyter out of town.\n\n\"People noticed, so 'twas said, that Milly's sweet disposition changed.\nSome said it was because she would soon become a mother, en' others\nsaid she was pinin' after the new religion. An' there was women who\nsaid right out that she was pinin' after the Mormon. Anyway, one mornin'\nFrank rode in from one of his trips, to find Milly gone. He had no real\nnear neighbors--livin' a little out of town--but those who was nearest\nsaid a wagon had gone by in the night, an' they thought it stopped at her\ndoor. Well, tracks always tell, an' there was the wagon tracks an' hoss\ntracks an' man tracks. The news spread like wildfire that Milly had run\noff from her husband. Everybody but Frank believed it an' wasn't slow in\ntellin' why she run off. Mother had always hated that strange streak of\nMilly's, takin' up with the new religion as she had, an' she believed\nMilly ran off with the Mormon. That hastened mother's death, an' she\ndied unforgivin'. Father wasn't the kind to bow down under disgrace or\nmisfortune but he had surpassin' love for Milly, an' the loss of her\nbroke him.\n\n\"From the minute I heard of Milly's disappearance I never believed she\nwent off of her own free will. I knew Milly, an' I knew she couldn't\nhave done that. I stayed at home awhile, tryin' to make Frank Erne talk.\nBut if he knowed anythin' then he wouldn't tell it. So I set out to find\nMilly. An' I tried to get on the trail of that proselyter. I knew if I\never struck a town he'd visited that I'd get a trail. I knew, too, that\nnothin' short of hell would stop his proselytin'. An' I rode from town\nto town. I had a blind faith that somethin' was guidin' me. An' as the\nweeks an' months went by I growed into a strange sort of a man, I guess.\nAnyway, people were afraid of me. Two years after that, way over in a\ncorner of Texas, I struck a town where my man had been. He'd jest left.\nPeople said he came to that town without a woman. I back-trailed my man\nthrough Arkansas an' Mississippi, an' the old trail got hot again in\nTexas. I found the town where he first went after leavin' home. An' here\nI got track of Milly. I found a cabin where she had given birth to her\nbaby. There was no way to tell whether she'd been kept a prisoner or\nnot. The feller who owned the place was a mean, silent sort of a skunk,\nan' as I was leavin' I jest took a chance an' left my mark on him. Then\nI went home again.\n\n\"It was to find I hadn't any home, no more. Father had been dead a year.\nFrank Erne still lived in the house where Milly had left him. I stayed\nwith him awhile, an' I grew old watchin' him. His farm had gone to weed,\nhis cattle had strayed or been rustled, his house weathered till it\nwouldn't keep out rain nor wind. An' Frank set on the porch and whittled\nsticks, an' day by day wasted away. There was times when he ranted about\nlike a crazy man, but mostly he was always sittin' an' starin' with eyes\nthat made a man curse. I figured Frank had a secret fear that I needed\nto know. An' when I told him I'd trailed Milly for near three years an'\nhad got trace of her, an' saw where she'd had her baby, I thought he\nwould drop dead at my feet. An' when he'd come round more natural-like\nhe begged me to give up the trail. But he wouldn't explain. So I let him\nalone, an' watched him day en' night.\n\n\"An' I found there was one thing still precious to him, an' it was a\nlittle drawer where he kept his papers. This was in the room where he\nslept. An' it 'peered he seldom slept. But after bein' patient I got the\ncontents of that drawer an' found two letters from Milly. One was a long\nletter written a few months after her disappearance. She had been bound\nan' gagged an' dragged away from her home by three men, an' she named\nthem--Hurd, Metzger, Slack. They was strangers to her. She was taken\nto the little town where I found trace of her two years after. But she\ndidn't send the letter from that town. There she was penned in. 'Peared\nthat the proselytes, who had, of course, come on the scene, was not\nrunnin' any risks of losin' her. She went on to say that for a time\nshe was out of her head, an' when she got right again all that kept\nher alive was the baby. It was a beautiful baby, she said, an' all she\nthought an' dreamed of was somehow to get baby back to its father, an'\nthen she'd thankfully lay down and die. An' the letter ended abrupt, in\nthe middle of a sentence, en' it wasn't signed.\n\n\"The second letter was written more than two years after the first. It\nwas from Salt Lake City. It simply said that Milly had heard her brother\nwas on her trail. She asked Frank to tell her brother to give up the\nsearch because if he didn't she would suffer in a way too horrible\nto tell. She didn't beg. She just stated a fact an' made the simple\nrequest. An' she ended that letter by sayin' she would soon leave Salt\nLake City with the man she had come to love, en' would never be heard of\nagain.\n\n\"I recognized Milly's handwritin', an' I recognized her way of puttin'\nthings. But that second letter told me of some great change in her.\nPonderin' over it, I felt at last she'd either come to love that feller\nan' his religion, or some terrible fear made her lie an' say so. I\ncouldn't be sure which. But, of course, I meant to find out. I'll say\nhere, if I'd known Mormons then as I do now I'd left Milly to her fate.\nFor mebbe she was right about what she'd suffer if I kept on her trail.\nBut I was young an' wild them days. First I went to the town where she'd\nfirst been taken, an' I went to the place where she'd been kept. I got\nthat skunk who owned the place, an' took him out in the woods, an' made\nhim tell all he knowed. That wasn't much as to length, but it was pure\nhell's-fire in substance. This time I left him some incapacitated for\nany more skunk work short of hell. Then I hit the trail for Utah.\n\n\"That was fourteen years ago. I saw the incomin' of most of the Mormons.\nIt was a wild country an' a wild time. I rode from town to town, village\nto village, ranch to ranch, camp to camp. I never stayed long in one\nplace. I never had but one idea. I never rested. Four years went by, an'\nI knowed every trail in northern Utah. I kept on an' as time went by,\nan' I'd begun to grow old in my search, I had firmer, blinder faith in\nwhatever was guidin' me. Once I read about a feller who sailed the seven\nseas an' traveled the world, an' he had a story to tell, an' whenever he\nseen the man to whom he must tell that story he knowed him on sight. I\nwas like that, only I had a question to ask. An' always I knew the man\nof whom I must ask. So I never really lost the trail, though for many\nyears it was the dimmest trail ever followed by any man.\n\n\"Then come a change in my luck. Along in Central Utah I rounded up Hurd,\nan' I whispered somethin' in his ear, an' watched his face, an' then\nthrowed a gun against his bowels. An' he died with his teeth so tight\nshut I couldn't have pried them open with a knife. Slack an' Metzger\nthat same year both heard me whisper the same question, an' neither\nwould they speak a word when they lay dyin'. Long before I'd learned\nno man of this breed or class--or God knows what--would give up any\nsecrets! I had to see in a man's fear of death the connections with\nMilly Erne's fate. An' as the years passed at long intervals I would\nfind such a man.\n\n\"So as I drifted on the long trail down into southern Utah my name\npreceded me, an' I had to meet a people prepared for me, an' ready with\nguns. They made me a gun-man. An' that suited me. In all this time signs\nof the proselyter an' the giant with the blue-ice eyes an' the gold\nbeard seemed to fade dimmer out of the trail. Only twice in ten years\ndid I find a trace of that mysterious man who had visited the proselyter\nat my home village. What he had to do with Milly's fate was beyond all\nhope for me to learn, unless my guidin' spirit led me to him! As for\nthe other man, I knew, as sure as I breathed en' the stars shone en' the\nwind blew, that I'd meet him some day.\n\n\"Eighteen years I've been on the trail. An' it led me to the last lonely\nvillages of the Utah border. Eighteen years!... I feel pretty old now. I\nwas only twenty when I hit that trail. Well, as I told you, back here a\nways a Gentile said Jane Withersteen could tell me about Milly Erne an'\nshow me her grave!\"\n\nThe low voice ceased, and Lassiter slowly turned his sombrero round and\nround, and appeared to be counting the silver ornaments on the band.\nJane, leaning toward him, sat as if petrified, listening intently,\nwaiting to hear more. She could have shrieked, but power of tongue and\nlips were denied her. She saw only this sad, gray, passion-worn man, and\nshe heard only the faint rustling of the leaves.\n\n\"Well, I came to Cottonwoods,\" went on Lassiter, \"an' you showed me\nMilly's grave. An' though your teeth have been shut tighter 'n them of\nall the dead men lyin' back along that trail, jest the same you told me\nthe secret I've lived these eighteen years to hear! Jane, I said you'd\ntell me without ever me askin'. I didn't need to ask my question here.\nThe day, you remember, when that fat party throwed a gun on me in your\ncourt, an'--\"\n\n\"Oh! Hush!\" whispered Jane, blindly holding up her hands.\n\n\"I seen in your face that Dyer, now a bishop, was the proselyter who\nruined Milly Erne.\"\n\nFor an instant Jane Withersteen's brain was a whirling chaos and she\nrecovered to find herself grasping at Lassiter like one drowning. And as\nif by a lightning stroke she sprang from her dull apathy into exquisite\ntorture.\n\n\"It's a lie! Lassiter! No, no!\" she moaned. \"I swear--you're wrong!\"\n\n\"Stop! You'd perjure yourself! But I'll spare you that. You poor woman!\nStill blind! Still faithful!... Listen. I know. Let that settle it. An' I\ngive up my purpose!\"\n\n\"What is it--you say?\"\n\n\"I give up my purpose. I've come to see an' feel differently. I can't\nhelp poor Milly. An' I've outgrowed revenge. I've come to see I can be\nno judge for men. I can't kill a man jest for hate. Hate ain't the same\nwith me since I loved you and little Fay.\"\n\n\"Lassiter! You mean you won't kill him?\" Jane whispered.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"For my sake?\"\n\n\"I reckon. I can't understand, but I'll respect your feelin's.\"\n\n\"Because you--oh, because you love me?... Eighteen years! You were that\nterrible Lassiter! And now--because you love me?\"\n\n\"That's it, Jane.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll make me love you! How can I help but love you? My heart must\nbe stone. But--oh, Lassiter, wait, wait! Give me time. I'm not what I\nwas. Once it was so easy to love. Now it's easy to hate. Wait! My faith\nin God--some God--still lives. By it I see happier times for you, poor\npassion-swayed wanderer! For me--a miserable, broken woman. I loved your\nsister Milly. I will love you. I can't have fallen so low--I can't be\nso abandoned by God--that I've no love left to give you. Wait! Let us\nforget Milly's sad life. Ah, I knew it as no one else on earth! There's\none thing I shall tell you--if you are at my death-bed, but I can't\nspeak now.\"\n\n\"I reckon I don't want to hear no more,\" said Lassiter.\n\nJane leaned against him, as if some pent-up force had rent its way\nout, she fell into a paroxysm of weeping. Lassiter held her in silent\nsympathy. By degrees she regained composure, and she was rising,\nsensible of being relieved of a weighty burden, when a sudden start on\nLassiter's part alarmed her.\n\n\"I heard hosses--hosses with muffled hoofs!\" he said; and he got up\nguardedly.\n\n\"Where's Fay?\" asked Jane, hurriedly glancing round the shady knoll. The\nbright-haired child, who had appeared to be close all the time, was not\nin sight.\n\n\"Fay!\" called Jane.\n\nNo answering shout of glee. No patter of flying feet. Jane saw Lassiter\nstiffen.\n\n\"Fay--oh--Fay!\" Jane almost screamed.\n\nThe leaves quivered and rustled; a lonesome cricket chirped in the\ngrass, a bee hummed by. The silence of the waning afternoon breathed\nhateful portent. It terrified Jane. When had silence been so infernal?\n\n\"She's--only--strayed--out--of earshot,\" faltered Jane, looking at\nLassiter.\n\nPale, rigid as a statue, the rider stood, not in listening, searching\nposture, but in one of doomed certainty. Suddenly he grasped Jane with\nan iron hand, and, turning his face from her gaze, he strode with her\nfrom the knoll.\n\n\"See--Fay played here last--a house of stones an' sticks.... An' here's\na corral of pebbles with leaves for hosses,\" said Lassiter, stridently,\nand pointed to the ground. \"Back an' forth she trailed here.... See,\nshe's buried somethin'--a dead grasshopper--there's a tombstone... here\nshe went, chasin' a lizard--see the tiny streaked trail... she pulled\nbark off this cottonwood... look in the dust of the path--the letters you\ntaught her--she's drawn pictures of birds en' hosses an' people.... Look,\na cross! Oh, Jane, your cross!\"\n\nLassiter dragged Jane on, and as if from a book read the meaning of\nlittle Fay's trail. All the way down the knoll, through the shrubbery,\nround and round a cottonwood, Fay's vagrant fancy left records of her\nsweet musings and innocent play. Long had she lingered round a bird-nest\nto leave therein the gaudy wing of a butterfly. Long had she played\nbeside the running stream sending adrift vessels freighted with pebbly\ncargo. Then she had wandered through the deep grass, her tiny feet\nscarcely turning a fragile blade, and she had dreamed beside some old\nfaded flowers. Thus her steps led her into the broad lane. The little\ndimpled imprints of her bare feet showed clean-cut in the dust they went\na little way down the lane; and then, at a point where they stopped, the\ngreat tracks of a man led out from the shrubbery and returned.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. LASSITER'S WAY\n\nFootprints told the story of little Fay's abduction. In anguish Jane\nWithersteen turned speechlessly to Lassiter, and, confirming her fears,\nshe saw him gray-faced, aged all in a moment, stricken as if by a mortal\nblow.\n\nThen all her life seemed to fall about her in wreck and ruin.\n\n\"It's all over,\" she heard her voice whisper. \"It's ended. I'm\ngoing--I'm going--\"\n\n\"Where?\" demanded Lassiter, suddenly looming darkly over her.\n\n\"To--to those cruel men--\"\n\n\"Speak names!\" thundered Lassiter.\n\n\"To Bishop Dyer--to Tull,\" went on Jane, shocked into obedience.\n\n\"Well--what for?\"\n\n\"I want little Fay. I can't live without her. They've stolen her as they\nstole Milly Erne's child. I must have little Fay. I want only her. I\ngive up. I'll go and tell Bishop Dyer--I'm broken. I'll tell him I'm\nready for the yoke--only give me back Fay--and--and I'll marry Tull!\"\n\n\"Never!\" hissed Lassiter.\n\nHis long arm leaped at her. Almost running, he dragged her under the\ncottonwoods, across the court, into the huge hall of Withersteen House,\nand he shut the door with a force that jarred the heavy walls. Black\nStar and Night and Bells, since their return, had been locked in this\nhall, and now they stamped on the stone floor.\n\nLassiter released Jane and like a dizzy man swayed from her with a\nhoarse cry and leaned shaking against a table where he kept his rider's\naccoutrements. He began to fumble in his saddlebags. His action brought\na clinking, metallic sound--the rattling of gun-cartridges. His fingers\ntrembled as he slipped cartridges into an extra belt. But as he buckled\nit over the one he habitually wore his hands became steady. This second\nbelt contained two guns, smaller than the black ones swinging low, and\nhe slipped them round so that his coat hid them. Then he fell to swift\naction. Jane Withersteen watched him, fascinated but uncomprehending and\nshe saw him rapidly saddle Black Star and Night. Then he drew her into\nthe light of the huge windows, standing over her, gripping her arm with\nfingers like cold steel.\n\n\"Yes, Jane, it's ended--but you're not goin' to Dyer!... I'm goin'\ninstead!\"\n\nLooking at him--he was so terrible of aspect--she could not comprehend\nhis words. Who was this man with the face gray as death, with eyes\nthat would have made her shriek had she the strength, with the strange,\nruthlessly bitter lips? Where was the gentle Lassiter? What was this\npresence in the hall, about him, about her--this cold, invisible\npresence?\n\n\"Yes, it's ended, Jane,\" he was saying, so awfully quiet and cool and\nimplacable, \"an' I'm goin' to make a little call. I'll lock you in here,\nan' when I get back have the saddle-bags full of meat an bread. An' be\nready to ride!\"\n\n\"Lassiter!\" cried Jane.\n\nDesperately she tried to meet his gray eyes, in vain, desperately she\ntried again, fought herself as feeling and thought resurged in torment,\nand she succeeded, and then she knew.\n\n\"No--no--no!\" she wailed. \"You said you'd foregone your vengeance. You\npromised not to kill Bishop Dyer.\"\n\n\"If you want to talk to me about him--leave off the Bishop. I don't\nunderstand that name, or its use.\"\n\n\"Oh, hadn't you foregone your vengeance on--on Dyer?\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But--your actions--your words--your guns--your terrible looks!... They\ndon't seem foregoing vengeance?\"\n\n\"Jane, now it's justice.\"\n\n\"You'll--kill him?\"\n\n\"If God lets me live another hour! If not God--then the devil who drives\nme!\"\n\n\"You'll kill him--for yourself--for your vengeful hate?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"For Milly Erne's sake?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"For little Fay's?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Oh--for whose?\"\n\n\"For yours!\"\n\n\"His blood on my soul!\" whispered Jane, and she fell to her knees.\nThis was the long-pending hour of fruition. And the habit of years--the\nreligious passion of her life--leaped from lethargy, and the long months\nof gradual drifting to doubt were as if they had never been. \"If you\nspill his blood it'll be on my soul--and on my father's. Listen.\"\nAnd she clasped his knees, and clung there as he tried to raise her.\n\"Listen. Am I nothing to you?\"\n\n\"Woman--don't trifle at words! I love you! An' I'll soon prove it.\"\n\n\"I'll give myself to you--I'll ride away with you--marry you, if only\nyou'll spare him?\"\n\nHis answer was a cold, ringing, terrible laugh.\n\n\"Lassiter--I'll love you. Spare him!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe sprang up in despairing, breaking spirit, and encircled his neck\nwith her arms, and held him in an embrace that he strove vainly to\nloosen. \"Lassiter, would you kill me? I'm fighting my last fight for\nthe principles of my youth--love of religion, love of father. You don't\nknow--you can't guess the truth, and I can't speak ill. I'm losing\nall. I'm changing. All I've gone through is nothing to this hour. Pity\nme--help me in my weakness. You're strong again--oh, so cruelly, coldly\nstrong! You're killing me. I see you--feel you as some other Lassiter!\nMy master, be merciful--spare him!\"\n\nHis answer was a ruthless smile.\n\nShe clung the closer to him, and leaned her panting breast on him, and\nlifted her face to his. \"Lassiter, I do love you! It's leaped out of my\nagony. It comes suddenly with a terrible blow of truth. You are a man!\nI never knew it till now. Some wonderful change came to me when you\nbuckled on these guns and showed that gray, awful face. I loved you\nthen. All my life I've loved, but never as now. No woman can love like\na broken woman. If it were not for one thing--just one thing--and yet! I\ncan't speak it--I'd glory in your manhood--the lion in you that means to\nslay for me. Believe me--and spare Dyer. Be merciful--great as it's in\nyou to be great.... Oh, listen and believe--I have nothing, but I'm a\nwoman--a beautiful woman, Lassiter--a passionate, loving woman--and I\nlove you! Take me--hide me in some wild place--and love me and mend my\nbroken heart. Spare him and take me away.\"\n\nShe lifted her face closer and closer to his, until their lips nearly\ntouched, and she hung upon his neck, and with strength almost spent\npressed and still pressed her palpitating body to his.\n\n\"Kiss me!\" she whispered, blindly.\n\n\"No--not at your price!\" he answered. His voice had changed or she had\nlost clearness of hearing.\n\n\"Kiss me!... Are you a man? Kiss me and save me!\"\n\n\"Jane, you never played fair with me. But now you're blisterin' your\nlips--blackenin' your soul with lies!\"\n\n\"By the memory of my mother--by my Bible--no! No, I have no Bible! But\nby my hope of heaven I swear I love you!\"\n\nLassiter's gray lips formed soundless words that meant even her love\ncould not avail to bend his will. As if the hold of her arms was that of\na child's he loosened it and stepped away.\n\n\"Wait! Don't go! Oh, hear a last word!... May a more just and merciful\nGod than the God I was taught to worship judge me--forgive me--save me!\nFor I can no longer keep silent!... Lassiter, in pleading for Dyer I've\nbeen pleading more for my father. My father was a Mormon master, close\nto the leaders of the church. It was my father who sent Dyer out to\nproselyte. It was my father who had the blue-ice eye and the beard of\ngold. It was my father you got trace of in the past years. Truly, Dyer\nruined Milly Erne--dragged her from her home--to Utah--to Cottonwoods.\nBut it was for my father! If Milly Erne was ever wife of a Mormon that\nMormon was my father! I never knew--never will know whether or not she\nwas a wife. Blind I may be, Lassiter--fanatically faithful to a false\nreligion I may have been but I know justice, and my father is beyond\nhuman justice. Surely he is meeting just punishment--somewhere. Always\nit has appalled me--the thought of your killing Dyer for my father's\nsins. So I have prayed!\"\n\n\"Jane, the past is dead. In my love for you I forgot the past. This\nthing I'm about to do ain't for myself or Milly or Fay. It's not because\nof anythin' that ever happened in the past, but for what is happenin'\nright now. It's for you!... An' listen. Since I was a boy I've never\nthanked God for anythin'. If there is a God--an' I've come to believe\nit--I thank Him now for the years that made me Lassiter!... I can reach\ndown en' feel these big guns, en' know what I can do with them. An',\nJane, only one of the miracles Dyer professes to believe in can save\nhim!\"\n\nAgain for Jane Withersteen came the spinning of her brain in darkness,\nand as she whirled in endless chaos she seemed to be falling at the feet\nof a luminous figure--a man--Lassiter--who had saved her from herself,\nwho could not be changed, who would slay rightfully. Then she slipped\ninto utter blackness.\n\nWhen she recovered from her faint she became aware that she was lying on\na couch near the window in her sitting-room. Her brow felt damp and cold\nand wet, some one was chafing her hands; she recognized Judkins, and\nthen saw that his lean, hard face wore the hue and look of excessive\nagitation.\n\n\"Judkins!\" Her voice broke weakly.\n\n\"Aw, Miss Withersteen, you're comin' round fine. Now jest lay still a\nlittle. You're all right; everythin's all right.\"\n\n\"Where is--he?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Lassiter!\"\n\n\"You needn't worry none about him.\"\n\n\"Where is he? Tell me--instantly.\"\n\n\"Wal, he's in the other room patchin' up a few triflin' bullet holes.\"\n\n\"Ah!... Bishop' Dyer?\"\n\n\"When I seen him last--a matter of half an hour ago, he was on his\nknees. He was some busy, but he wasn't prayin'!\"\n\n\"How strangely you talk! I'll sit up. I'm--well, strong again. Tell me.\nDyer on his knees! What was he doing?\"\n\n\"Wal, beggin' your pardon fer blunt talk, Miss Withersteen, Dyer was\non his knees an' not prayin'. You remember his big, broad hands? You've\nseen 'em raised in blessin' over old gray men an' little curly-headed\nchildren like--like Fay Larkin! Come to think of thet, I disremember\never hearin' of his liftin' his big hands in blessin' over a woman. Wal,\nwhen I seen him last--jest a little while ago--he was on his knees,\nnot prayin', as I remarked--an' he was pressin' his big hands over some\nbigger wounds.\"\n\n\"Man, you drive me mad! Did Lassiter kill Dyer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did he kill Tull?\"\n\n\"No. Tull's out of the village with most of his riders. He's expected\nback before evenin'. Lassiter will hev to git away before Tull en' his\nriders come in. It's sure death fer him here. An' wuss fer you, too,\nMiss Withersteen. There'll be some of an uprisin' when Tull gits back.\"\n\n\"I shall ride away with Lassiter. Judkins, tell me all you saw--all you\nknow about this killing.\" She realized, without wonder or amaze, how\nJudkins's one word, affirming the death of Dyer--that the catastrophe\nhad fallen--had completed the change whereby she had been molded or\nbeaten or broken into another woman. She felt calm, slightly cold,\nstrong as she had not been strong since the first shadow fell upon her.\n\n\"I jest saw about all of it, Miss Withersteen, an' I'll be glad to tell\nyou if you'll only hev patience with me,\" said Judkins, earnestly. \"You\nsee, I've been pecooliarly interested, an' nat'rully I'm some excited.\nAn' I talk a lot thet mebbe ain't necessary, but I can't help thet.\n\n\"I was at the meetin'-house where Dyer was holdin' court. You know he\nallus acts as magistrate an' judge when Tull's away. An' the trial\nwas fer tryin' what's left of my boy riders--thet helped me hold your\ncattle--fer a lot of hatched-up things the boys never did. We're used to\nthet, an' the boys wouldn't hev minded bein' locked up fer a while,\nor hevin' to dig ditches, or whatever the judge laid down. You see, I\ndivided the gold you give me among all my boys, an' they all hid it,\nen' they all feel rich. Howsomever, court was adjourned before the judge\npassed sentence. Yes, ma'm, court was adjourned some strange an' quick,\nmuch as if lightnin' hed struck the meetin'-house.\n\n\"I hed trouble attendin' the trial, but I got in. There was a good many\npeople there, all my boys, an' Judge Dyer with his several clerks. Also\nhe hed with him the five riders who've been guardin' him pretty close of\nlate. They was Carter, Wright, Jengessen, an' two new riders from Stone\nBridge. I didn't hear their names, but I heard they was handy men with\nguns an' they looked more like rustlers than riders. Anyway, there they\nwas, the five all in a row.\n\n\"Judge Dyer was tellin' Willie Kern, one of my best an' steadiest\nboys--Dyer was tellin' him how there was a ditch opened near Willie's\nhome lettin' water through his lot, where it hadn't ought to go. An'\nWillie was tryin' to git a word in to prove he wasn't at home all the\nday it happened--which was true, as I know--but Willie couldn't git a\nword in, an' then Judge Dyer went on layin' down the law. An' all to\nonct he happened to look down the long room. An' if ever any man turned\nto stone he was thet man.\n\n\"Nat'rully I looked back to see what hed acted so powerful strange on\nthe judge. An' there, half-way up the room, in the middle of the wide\naisle, stood Lassiter! All white an' black he looked, an' I can't think\nof anythin' he resembled, onless it's death. Venters made thet same room\nsome still an' chilly when he called Tull; but this was different. I\ngive my word, Miss Withersteen, thet I went cold to my very marrow. I\ndon't know why. But Lassiter had a way about him thet's awful. He spoke\na word--a name--I couldn't understand it, though he spoke clear as a\nbell. I was too excited, mebbe. Judge Dyer must hev understood it, an' a\nlot more thet was mystery to me, for he pitched forrard out of his chair\nright onto the platform.\n\n\"Then them five riders, Dyer's bodyguards, they jumped up, an' two of\nthem thet I found out afterward were the strangers from Stone Bridge,\nthey piled right out of a winder, so quick you couldn't catch your\nbreath. It was plain they wasn't Mormons.\n\n\"Jengessen, Carter, an' Wright eyed Lassiter, for what must hev been a\nsecond an' seemed like an hour, an' they went white en' strung. But they\ndidn't weaken nor lose their nerve.\n\n\"I hed a good look at Lassiter. He stood sort of stiff, bendin' a\nlittle, an' both his arms were crooked an' his hands looked like a\nhawk's claws. But there ain't no tellin' how his eyes looked. I know\nthis, though, an' thet is his eyes could read the mind of any man about\nto throw a gun. An' in watchin' him, of course, I couldn't see the\nthree men go fer their guns. An' though I was lookin' right at\nLassiter--lookin' hard--I couldn't see how he drawed. He was quicker 'n\neyesight--thet's all. But I seen the red spurtin' of his guns, en' heard\nhis shots jest the very littlest instant before I heard the shots of the\nriders. An' when I turned, Wright an' Carter was down, en' Jengessen,\nwho's tough like a steer, was pullin' the trigger of a wabblin' gun. But\nit was plain he was shot through, plumb center. An' sudden he fell with\na crash, an' his gun clattered on the floor.\n\n\"Then there was a hell of a silence. Nobody breathed. Sartin I didn't,\nanyway. I saw Lassiter slip a smokin' gun back in a belt. But he hadn't\nthrowed either of the big black guns, an' I thought thet strange. An'\nall this was happenin' quick--you can't imagine how quick.\n\n\"There come a scrapin' on the floor an' Dyer got up, his face like lead.\nI wanted to watch Lassiter, but Dyer's face, onct I seen it like thet,\nglued my eyes. I seen him go fer his gun--why, I could hev done better,\nquicker--an' then there was a thunderin' shot from Lassiter, an' it\nhit Dyer's right arm, an' his gun went off as it dropped. He looked at\nLassiter like a cornered sage-wolf, an' sort of howled, an' reached down\nfer his gun. He'd jest picked it off the floor an' was raisin' it when\nanother thunderin' shot almost tore thet arm off--so it seemed to me.\nThe gun dropped again an' he went down on his knees, kind of flounderin'\nafter it. It was some strange an' terrible to see his awful earnestness.\nWhy would such a man cling so to life? Anyway, he got the gun with left\nhand an' was raisin' it, pullin' trigger in his madness, when the third\nthunderin' shot hit his left arm, an' he dropped the gun again. But\nthet left arm wasn't useless yet, fer he grabbed up the gun, an' with\na shakin' aim thet would hev been pitiful to me--in any other man--he\nbegan to shoot. One wild bullet struck a man twenty feet from Lassiter.\nAn' it killed thet man, as I seen afterward. Then come a bunch of\nthunderin' shots--nine I calkilated after, fer they come so quick I\ncouldn't count them--an' I knew Lassiter hed turned the black guns loose\non Dyer.\n\n\"I'm tellin' you straight, Miss Withersteen, fer I want you to know.\nAfterward you'll git over it. I've seen some soul-rackin' scenes on this\nUtah border, but this was the awfulest. I remember I closed my eyes, an'\nfer a minute I thought of the strangest things, out of place there, such\nas you'd never dream would come to mind. I saw the sage, an' runnin'\nhosses--an' thet's the beautfulest sight to me--an' I saw dim things\nin the dark, an' there was a kind of hummin' in my ears. An' I remember\ndistinctly--fer it was what made all these things whirl out of my mind\nan' opened my eyes--I remember distinctly it was the smell of gunpowder.\n\n\"The court had about adjourned fer thet judge. He was on his knees, en'\nhe wasn't prayin'. He was gaspin' an' tryin' to press his big,\nfloppin', crippled hands over his body. Lassiter had sent all those last\nthunderin' shots through his body. Thet was Lassiter's way.\n\n\"An' Lassiter spoke, en' if I ever forgit his words I'll never forgit\nthe sound of his voice.\n\n\"'Proselyter, I reckon you'd better call quick on thet God who reveals\nHisself to you on earth, because He won't be visitin' the place you're\ngoin' to!\"\n\n\"An' then I seen Dyer look at his big, hangin' hands thet wasn't big\nenough fer the last work he set them to. An' he looked up at Lassiter.\nAn' then he stared horrible at somethin' thet wasn't Lassiter, nor\nanyone there, nor the room, nor the branches of purple sage peepin'\ninto the winder. Whatever he seen, it was with the look of a man who\ndiscovers somethin' too late. Thet's a terrible look!... An' with a\nhorrible understandin' cry he slid forrard on his face.\"\n\nJudkins paused in his narrative, breathing heavily while he wiped his\nperspiring brow.\n\n\"Thet's about all,\" he concluded. \"Lassiter left the meetin'-house an' I\nhurried to catch up with him. He was bleedin' from three gunshots,\nnone of them much to bother him. An' we come right up here. I found you\nlayin' in the hall, an' I hed to work some over you.\"\n\nJane Withersteen offered up no prayer for Dyer's soul.\n\nLassiter's step sounded in the hall--the familiar soft, silver-clinking\nstep--and she heard it with thrilling new emotions in which was a vague\njoy in her very fear of him. The door opened, and she saw him, the old\nLassiter, slow, easy, gentle, cool, yet not exactly the same Lassiter.\nShe rose, and for a moment her eyes blurred and swam in tears.\n\n\"Are you--all--all right?\" she asked, tremulously.\n\n\"I reckon.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, I'll ride away with you. Hide me till danger is past--till\nwe are forgotten--then take me where you will. Your people shall be my\npeople, and your God my God!\"\n\nHe kissed her hand with the quaint grace and courtesy that came to him\nin rare moments.\n\n\"Black Star an' Night are ready,\" he said, simply.\n\nHis quiet mention of the black racers spurred Jane to action. Hurrying\nto her room, she changed to her rider's suit, packed her jewelry, and\nthe gold that was left, and all the woman's apparel for which there\nwas space in the saddle-bags, and then returned to the hall. Black Star\nstamped his iron-shod hoofs and tossed his beautiful head, and eyed her\nwith knowing eyes.\n\n\"Judkins, I give Bells to you,\" said Jane. \"I hope you will always keep\nhim and be good to him.\"\n\nJudkins mumbled thanks that he could not speak fluently, and his eyes\nflashed.\n\nLassiter strapped Jane's saddle-bags upon Black Star, and led the racers\nout into the court.\n\n\"Judkins, you ride with Jane out into the sage. If you see any riders\ncomin' shout quick twice. An', Jane, don't look back! I'll catch up\nsoon. We'll get to the break into the Pass before midnight, an' then\nwait until mornin' to go down.\"\n\nBlack Star bent his graceful neck and bowed his noble head, and his\nbroad shoulders yielded as he knelt for Jane to mount.\n\nShe rode out of the court beside Judkins, through the grove, across\nthe wide lane into the sage, and she realized that she was leaving\nWithersteen House forever, and she did not look back. A strange, dreamy,\ncalm peace pervaded her soul. Her doom had fallen upon her, but, instead\nof finding life no longer worth living she found it doubly significant,\nfull of sweetness as the western breeze, beautiful and unknown as the\nsage-slope stretching its purple sunset shadows before her. She became\naware of Judkins's hand touching hers; she heard him speak a husky\ngood-by; then into the place of Bells shot the dead-black, keen, racy\nnose of Night, and she knew Lassiter rode beside her.\n\n\"Don't--look--back!\" he said, and his voice, too, was not clear.\n\nFacing straight ahead, seeing only the waving, shadowy sage, Jane held\nout her gauntleted hand, to feel it enclosed in strong clasp. So she\nrode on without a backward glance at the beautiful grove of Cottonwoods.\nShe did not seem to think of the past of what she left forever, but of\nthe color and mystery and wildness of the sage-slope leading down to\nDeception Pass, and of the future. She watched the shadows lengthen down\nthe slope; she felt the cool west wind sweeping by from the rear; and\nshe wondered at low, yellow clouds sailing swiftly over her and beyond.\n\n\"Don't look--back!\" said Lassiter.\n\nThick-driving belts of smoke traveled by on the wind, and with it came a\nstrong, pungent odor of burning wood.\n\nLassiter had fired Withersteen House! But Jane did not look back.\n\nA misty veil obscured the clear, searching gaze she had kept steadfastly\nupon the purple slope and the dim lines of canyons. It passed, as passed\nthe rolling clouds of smoke, and she saw the valley deepening into the\nshades of twilight. Night came on, swift as the fleet racers, and stars\npeeped out to brighten and grow, and the huge, windy, eastern heave of\nsage-level paled under a rising moon and turned to silver. Blanched\nin moonlight, the sage yet seemed to hold its hue of purple and was\ninfinitely more wild and lonely. So the night hours wore on, and Jane\nWithersteen never once looked back.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. BLACK STAR AND NIGHT\n\nThe time had come for Venters and Bess to leave their retreat. They were\nat great pains to choose the few things they would be able to carry with\nthem on the journey out of Utah.\n\n\"Bern, whatever kind of a pack's this, anyhow?\" questioned Bess, rising\nfrom her work with reddened face.\n\nVenters, absorbed in his own task, did not look up at all, and in reply\nsaid he had brought so much from Cottonwoods that he did not recollect\nthe half of it.\n\n\"A woman packed this!\" Bess exclaimed.\n\nHe scarcely caught her meaning, but the peculiar tone of her voice\ncaused him instantly to rise, and he saw Bess on her knees before an\nopen pack which he recognized as the one given him by Jane.\n\n\"By George!\" he ejaculated, guiltily, and then at sight of Bess's face\nhe laughed outright.\n\n\"A woman packed this,\" she repeated, fixing woeful, tragic eyes on him.\n\n\"Well, is that a crime?'\n\n\"There--there is a woman, after all!\"\n\n\"Now Bess--\"\n\n\"You've lied to me!\"\n\nThen and there Venters found it imperative to postpone work for the\npresent. All her life Bess had been isolated, but she had inherited\ncertain elements of the eternal feminine.\n\n\"But there was a woman and you did lie to me,\" she kept repeating, after\nhe had explained.\n\n\"What of that? Bess, I'll get angry at you in a moment. Remember you've\nbeen pent up all your life. I venture to say that if you'd been out in\nthe world you'd have had a dozen sweethearts and have told many a lie\nbefore this.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't anything of the kind,\" declared Bess, indignantly.\n\n\"Well--perhaps not lie. But you'd have had the sweethearts--You couldn't\nhave helped that--being so pretty.\"\n\nThis remark appeared to be a very clever and fortunate one; and the\nwork of selecting and then of stowing all the packs in the cave went on\nwithout further interruption.\n\nVenters closed up the opening of the cave with a thatch of willows and\naspens, so that not even a bird or a rat could get in to the sacks\nof grain. And this work was in order with the precaution habitually\nobserved by him. He might not be able to get out of Utah, and have to\nreturn to the valley. But he owed it to Bess to make the attempt, and in\ncase they were compelled to turn back he wanted to find that fine store\nof food and grain intact. The outfit of implements and utensils he\npacked away in another cave.\n\n\"Bess, we have enough to live here all our lives,\" he said once,\ndreamily.\n\n\"Shall I go roll Balancing Rock?\" she asked, in light speech, but with\ndeep-blue fire in her eyes.\n\n\"No--no.\"\n\n\"Ah, you don't forget the gold and the world,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Child, you forget the beautiful dresses and the travel--and\neverything.\"\n\n\"Oh, I want to go. But I want to stay!\"\n\n\"I feel the same way.\"\n\nThey let the eight calves out of the corral, and kept only two of the\nburros Venters had brought from Cottonwoods. These they intended to\nride. Bess freed all her pets--the quail and rabbits and foxes.\n\nThe last sunset and twilight and night were both the sweetest and\nsaddest they had ever spent in Surprise Valley. Morning brought keen\nexhilaration and excitement. When Venters had saddled the two burros,\nstrapped on the light packs and the two canteens, the sunlight was\ndispersing the lazy shadows from the valley. Taking a last look at the\ncaves and the silver spruces, Venters and Bess made a reluctant start,\nleading the burros. Ring and Whitie looked keen and knowing. Something\nseemed to drag at Venters's feet and he noticed Bess lagged behind.\nNever had the climb from terrace to bridge appeared so long.\n\nNot till they reached the opening of the gorge did they stop to rest and\ntake one last look at the valley. The tremendous arch of stone curved\nclear and sharp in outline against the morning sky. And through it\nstreaked the golden shaft. The valley seemed an enchanted circle of\nglorious veils of gold and wraiths of white and silver haze and dim,\nblue, moving shade--beautiful and wild and unreal as a dream.\n\n\"We--we can--th--think of it--always--re--remember,\" sobbed Bess.\n\n\"Hush! Don't cry. Our valley has only fitted us for a better life\nsomewhere. Come!\"\n\nThey entered the gorge and he closed the willow gate. From rosy, golden\nmorning light they passed into cool, dense gloom. The burros pattered\nup the trail with little hollow-cracking steps. And the gorge widened to\nnarrow outlet and the gloom lightened to gray. At the divide they halted\nfor another rest. Venters's keen, remembering gaze searched Balancing\nRock, and the long incline, and the cracked toppling walls, but failed\nto note the slightest change.\n\nThe dogs led the descent; then came Bess leading her burro; then Venters\nleading his. Bess kept her eyes bent downward. Venters, however, had\nan irresistible desire to look upward at Balancing Rock. It had always\nhaunted him, and now he wondered if he were really to get through the\noutlet before the huge stone thundered down. He fancied that would be\na miracle. Every few steps he answered to the strange, nervous fear and\nturned to make sure the rock still stood like a giant statue. And, as\nhe descended, it grew dimmer in his sight. It changed form; it swayed it\nnodded darkly; and at last, in his heightened fancy, he saw it heave and\nroll. As in a dream when he felt himself falling yet knew he would never\nfall, so he saw this long-standing thunderbolt of the little stone-men\nplunge down to close forever the outlet to Deception Pass.\n\nAnd while he was giving way to unaccountable dread imaginations the\ndescent was accomplished without mishap.\n\n\"I'm glad that's over,\" he said, breathing more freely. \"I hope I'm by\nthat hanging rock for good and all. Since almost the moment I first saw\nit I've had an idea that it was waiting for me. Now, when it does fall,\nif I'm thousands of miles away, I'll hear it.\"\n\nWith the first glimpses of the smooth slope leading down to the\ngrotesque cedars and out to the Pass, Venters's cool nerve returned. One\nlong survey to the left, then one to the right, satisfied his caution.\nLeading the burros down to the spur of rock, he halted at the steep\nincline.\n\n\"Bess, here's the bad place, the place I told you about, with the cut\nsteps. You start down, leading your burro. Take your time and hold on to\nhim if you slip. I've got a rope on him and a half-hitch on this point\nof rock, so I can let him down safely. Coming up here was a killing job.\nBut it'll be easy going down.\"\n\nBoth burros passed down the difficult stairs cut by the cliff-dwellers,\nand did it without a misstep. After that the descent down the slope and\nover the mile of scrawled, ripped, and ridged rock required only careful\nguidance, and Venters got the burros to level ground in a condition that\ncaused him to congratulate himself.\n\n\"Oh, if we only had Wrangle!\" exclaimed Venters. \"But we're lucky.\nThat's the worst of our trail passed. We've only men to fear now. If we\nget up in the sage we can hide and slip along like coyotes.\"\n\nThey mounted and rode west through the valley and entered the canyon.\nFrom time to time Venters walked, leading his burro. When they got by\nall the canyons and gullies opening into the Pass they went faster and\nwith fewer halts. Venters did not confide in Bess the alarming fact that\nhe had seen horses and smoke less than a mile up one of the intersecting\ncanyons. He did not talk at all. And long after he had passed this\ncanyon and felt secure once more in the certainty that they had been\nunobserved he never relaxed his watchfulness. But he did not walk any\nmore, and he kept the burros at a steady trot. Night fell before they\nreached the last water in the Pass and they made camp by starlight.\nVenters did not want the burros to stray, so he tied them with long\nhalters in the grass near the spring. Bess, tired out and silent, laid\nher head in a saddle and went to sleep between the two dogs. Venters\ndid not close his eyes. The canyon silence appeared full of the low,\ncontinuous hum of insects. He listened until the hum grew into a roar,\nand then, breaking the spell, once more he heard it low and clear. He\nwatched the stars and the moving shadows, and always his glance returned\nto the girl's dimly pale face. And he remembered how white and still\nit had once looked in the starlight. And again stern thought fought his\nstrange fancies. Would all his labor and his love be for naught? Would\nhe lose her, after all? What did the dark shadow around her portend? Did\ncalamity lurk on that long upland trail through the sage? Why should his\nheart swell and throb with nameless fear? He listened to the silence\nand told himself that in the broad light of day he could dispel this\nleaden-weighted dread.\n\nAt the first hint of gray over the eastern rim he awoke Bess, saddled\nthe burros, and began the day's travel. He wanted to get out of the Pass\nbefore there was any chance of riders coming down. They gained the break\nas the first red rays of the rising sun colored the rim.\n\nFor once, so eager was he to get up to level ground, he did not send\nRing or Whitie in advance. Encouraging Bess to hurry pulling at his\npatient, plodding burro, he climbed the soft, steep trail.\n\nBrighter and brighter grew the light. He mounted the last broken edge of\nrim to have the sun-fired, purple sage-slope burst upon him as a glory.\nBess panted up to his side, tugging on the halter of her burro.\n\n\"We're up!\" he cried, joyously. \"There's not a dot on the sage. We're\nsafe. We'll not be seen! Oh, Bess--\"\n\nRing growled and sniffed the keen air and bristled. Venters clutched\nat his rifle. Whitie sometimes made a mistake, but Ring never. The dull\nthud of hoofs almost deprived Venters of power to turn and see from\nwhere disaster threatened. He felt his eyes dilate as he stared at\nLassiter leading Black Star and Night out of the sage, with Jane\nWithersteen, in rider's costume, close beside them.\n\nFor an instant Venters felt himself whirl dizzily in the center of vast\ncircles of sage. He recovered partially, enough to see Lassiter standing\nwith a glad smile and Jane riveted in astonishment.\n\n\"Why, Bern!\" she exclaimed. \"How good it is to see you! We're riding\naway, you see. The storm burst--and I'm a ruined woman!... I thought you\nwere alone.\"\n\nVenters, unable to speak for consternation, and bewildered out of all\nsense of what he ought or ought not to do, simply stared at Jane.\n\n\"Son, where are you bound for?\" asked Lassiter.\n\n\"Not safe--where I was. I'm--we're going out of Utah--back East,\" he\nfound tongue to say.\n\n\"I reckon this meetin's the luckiest thing that ever happened to you an'\nto me--an' to Jane--an' to Bess,\" said Lassiter, coolly.\n\n\"Bess!\" cried Jane, with a sudden leap of blood to her pale cheek.\n\nIt was entirely beyond Venters to see any luck in that meeting.\n\nJane Withersteen took one flashing, woman's glance at Bess's scarlet\nface, at her slender, shapely form.\n\n\"Venters! is this a girl--a woman?\" she questioned, in a voice that\nstung.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you have her in that wonderful valley?\"\n\n\"Yes, but Jane--\"\n\n\"All the time you were gone?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I couldn't tell--\"\n\n\"Was it for her you asked me to give you supplies? Was it for her that\nyou wanted to make your valley a paradise?\"\n\n\"Oh--Jane--\"\n\n\"Answer me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, you liar!\" And with these passionate words Jane Withersteen\nsuccumbed to fury. For the second time in her life she fell into the\nungovernable rage that had been her father's weakness. And it was worse\nthan his, for she was a jealous woman--jealous even of her friends.\n\nAs best he could, he bore the brunt of her anger. It was not only his\ndeceit to her that she visited upon him, but her betrayal by religion,\nby life itself.\n\nHer passion, like fire at white heat, consumed itself in little time.\nHer physical strength failed, and still her spirit attempted to go on in\nmagnificent denunciation of those who had wronged her. Like a tree\ncut deep into its roots, she began to quiver and shake, and her anger\nweakened into despair. And her ringing voice sank into a broken, husky\nwhisper. Then, spent and pitiable, upheld by Lassiter's arm, she turned\nand hid her face in Black Star's mane.\n\nNumb as Venters was when at length Jane Withersteen lifted her head and\nlooked at him, he yet suffered a pang.\n\n\"Jane, the girl is innocent!\" he cried.\n\n\"Can you expect me to believe that?\" she asked, with weary, bitter eyes.\n\n\"I'm not that kind of a liar. And you know it. If I lied--if I kept\nsilent when honor should have made me speak, it was to spare you. I came\nto Cottonwoods to tell you. But I couldn't add to your pain. I intended\nto tell you I had come to love this girl. But, Jane I hadn't forgotten\nhow good you were to me. I haven't changed at all toward you. I prize\nyour friendship as I always have. But, however it may look to you--don't\nbe unjust. The girl is innocent. Ask Lassiter.\"\n\n\"Jane, she's jest as sweet an' innocent as little Fay,\" said Lassiter.\nThere was a faint smile upon his face and a beautiful light.\n\nVenters saw, and knew that Lassiter saw, how Jane Withersteen's tortured\nsoul wrestled with hate and threw it--with scorn doubt, suspicion, and\novercame all.\n\n\"Bern, if in my misery I accused you unjustly, I crave forgiveness,\" she\nsaid. \"I'm not what I once was. Tell me--who is this girl?\"\n\n\"Jane, she is Oldring's daughter, and his Masked Rider. Lassiter will\ntell you how I shot her for a rustler, saved her life--all the story.\nIt's a strange story, Jane, as wild as the sage. But it's true--true as\nher innocence. That you must believe.\"\n\n\"Oldring's Masked Rider! Oldring's daughter!\" exclaimed Jane \"And she's\ninnocent! You ask me to believe much. If this girl is--is what you say,\nhow could she be going away with the man who killed her father?\"\n\n\"Why did you tell that?\" cried Venters, passionately.\n\nJane's question had roused Bess out of stupefaction. Her eyes suddenly\ndarkened and dilated. She stepped toward Venters and held up both hands\nas if to ward off a blow.\n\n\"Did--did you kill Oldring?\"\n\n\"I did, Bess, and I hate myself for it. But you know I never dreamed\nhe was your father. I thought he'd wronged you. I killed him when I was\nmadly jealous.\"\n\nFor a moment Bess was shocked into silence.\n\n\"But he was my father!\" she broke out, at last. \"And now I must go\nback--I can't go with you. It's all over--that beautiful dream. Oh, I\nknew it couldn't come true. You can't take me now.\"\n\n\"If you forgive me, Bess, it'll all come right in the end!\" implored\nVenters.\n\n\"It can't be right. I'll go back. After all, I loved him. He was good to\nme. I can't forget that.\"\n\n\"If you go back to Oldring's men I'll follow you, and then they'll kill\nme,\" said Venters, hoarsely.\n\n\"Oh no, Bern, you'll not come. Let me go. It's best for you to forget\nme. I've brought you only pain and dishonor.\"\n\nShe did not weep. But the sweet bloom and life died out of her face.\nShe looked haggard and sad, all at once stunted; and her hands dropped\nlistlessly; and her head drooped in slow, final acceptance of a hopeless\nfate.\n\n\"Jane, look there!\" cried Venters, in despairing grief. \"Need you have\ntold her? Where was all your kindness of heart? This girl has had a\nwretched, lonely life. And I'd found a way to make her happy. You've\nkilled it. You've killed something sweet and pure and hopeful, just as\nsure as you breathe.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bern! It was a slip. I never thought--I never thought!\" replied\nJane. \"How could I tell she didn't know?\"\n\nLassiter suddenly moved forward, and with the beautiful light on his\nface now strangely luminous, he looked at Jane and Venters and then let\nhis soft, bright gaze rest on Bess.\n\n\"Well, I reckon you've all had your say, an' now it's Lassiter's turn.\nWhy, I was jest praying for this meetin'. Bess, jest look here.\"\n\nGently he touched her arm and turned her to face the others, and then\noutspread his great hand to disclose a shiny, battered gold locket.\n\n\"Open it,\" he said, with a singularly rich voice.\n\nBess complied, but listlessly.\n\n\"Jane--Venters--come closer,\" went on Lassiter. \"Take a look at the\npicture. Don't you know the woman?\"\n\nJane, after one glance, drew back.\n\n\"Milly Erne!\" she cried, wonderingly.\n\nVenters, with tingling pulse, with something growing on him, recognized\nin the faded miniature portrait the eyes of Milly Erne.\n\n\"Yes, that's Milly,\" said Lassiter, softly. \"Bess, did you ever see her\nface--look hard--with all your heart an' soul?\"\n\n\"The eyes seem to haunt me,\" whispered Bess. \"Oh, I can't\nremember--they're eyes of my dreams--but--but--\"\n\nLassiter's strong arm went round her and he bent his head.\n\n\"Child, I thought you'd remember her eyes. They're the same beautiful\neyes you'd see if you looked in a mirror or a clear spring. They're your\nmother's eyes. You are Milly Erne's child. Your name is Elizabeth Erne.\nYou're not Oldring's daughter. You're the daughter of Frank Erne, a man\nonce my best friend. Look! Here's his picture beside Milly's. He was\nhandsome, an' as fine an' gallant a Southern gentleman as I ever seen.\nFrank came of an old family. You come of the best of blood, lass, and\nblood tells.\"\n\nBess slipped through his arm to her knees and hugged the locket to her\nbosom, and lifted wonderful, yearning eyes.\n\n\"It--can't--be--true!\"\n\n\"Thank God, lass, it is true,\" replied Lassiter. \"Jane an' Bern\nhere--they both recognize Milly. They see Milly in you. They're so\nknocked out they can't tell you, that's all.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" whispered Bess.\n\n\"I reckon I'm Milly's brother an' your uncle!... Uncle Jim! Ain't that\nfine?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't believe--Don't raise me! Bern, let me kneel. I see truth\nin your face--in Miss Withersteen's. But let me hear it all--all on my\nknees. Tell me how it's true!\"\n\n\"Well, Elizabeth, listen,\" said Lassiter. \"Before you was born your\nfather made a mortal enemy of a Mormon named Dyer. They was both\nministers an' come to be rivals. Dyer stole your mother away from her\nhome. She gave birth to you in Texas eighteen years ago. Then she was\ntaken to Utah, from place to place, an' finally to the last border\nsettlement--Cottonwoods. You was about three years old when you was\ntaken away from Milly. She never knew what had become of you. But she\nlived a good while hopin' and prayin' to have you again. Then she gave\nup an' died. An' I may as well put in here your father died ten years\nago. Well, I spent my time tracin' Milly, an' some months back I landed\nin Cottonwoods. An' jest lately I learned all about you. I had a talk\nwith Oldrin' an' told him you was dead, an' he told me what I had so\nlong been wantin' to know. It was Dyer, of course, who stole you from\nMilly. Part reason he was sore because Milly refused to give you Mormon\nteachin', but mostly he still hated Frank Erne so infernally that he\nmade a deal with Oldrin' to take you an' bring you up as an infamous\nrustler an' rustler's girl. The idea was to break Frank Erne's heart\nif he ever came to Utah--to show him his daughter with a band of low\nrustlers. Well--Oldrin' took you, brought you up from childhood, an'\nthen made you his Masked Rider. He made you infamous. He kept that part\nof the contract, but he learned to love you as a daughter an' never let\nany but his own men know you was a girl. I heard him say that with my\nown ears, an' I saw his big eyes grow dim. He told me how he had guarded\nyou always, kept you locked up in his absence, was always at your side\nor near you on those rides that made you famous on the sage. He said he\nan' an old rustler whom he trusted had taught you how to read an' write.\nThey selected the books for you. Dyer had wanted you brought up the\nvilest of the vile! An' Oldrin' brought you up the innocentest of the\ninnocent. He said you didn't know what vileness was. I can hear his big\nvoice tremble now as he said it. He told me how the men--rustlers an'\noutlaws--who from time to time tried to approach you familiarly--he told\nme how he shot them dead. I'm tellin' you this 'specially because you've\nshowed such shame--sayin' you was nameless an' all that. Nothin' on\nearth can be wronger than that idea of yours. An' the truth of it is\nhere. Oldrin' swore to me that if Dyer died, releasin' the contract,\nhe intended to hunt up your father an' give you back to him. It seems\nOldrin' wasn't all bad, en' he sure loved you.\"\n\nVenters leaned forward in passionate remorse.\n\n\"Oh, Bess! I know Lassiter speaks the truth. For when I shot Oldring he\ndropped to his knees and fought with unearthly power to speak. And he\nsaid: 'Man--why--didn't--you--wait? Bess was--' Then he fell dead.\nAnd I've been haunted by his look and words. Oh, Bess, what a strange,\nsplendid thing for Oldring to do! It all seems impossible. But, dear,\nyou really are not what you thought.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth Erne!\" cried Jane Withersteen. \"I loved your mother and I see\nher in you!\"\n\nWhat had been incredible from the lips of men became, in the tone,\nlook, and gesture of a woman, a wonderful truth for Bess. With little\ntremblings of all her slender body she rocked to and fro on her knees.\nThe yearning wistfulness of her eyes changed to solemn splendor of joy.\nShe believed. She was realizing happiness. And as the process of thought\nwas slow, so were the variations of her expression. Her eyes reflected\nthe transformation of her soul. Dark, brooding, hopeless belief--clouds\nof gloom--drifted, paled, vanished in glorious light. An exquisite rose\nflush--a glow--shone from her face as she slowly began to rise from her\nknees. A spirit uplifted her. All that she had held as base dropped from\nher.\n\nVenters watched her in joy too deep for words. By it he divined\nsomething of what Lassiter's revelation meant to Bess, but he knew he\ncould only faintly understand. That moment when she seemed to be lifted\nby some spiritual transfiguration was the most beautiful moment of his\nlife. She stood with parted, quivering lips, with hands tightly clasping\nthe locket to her heaving breast. A new conscious pride of worth\ndignified the old wild, free grace and poise.\n\n\"Uncle Jim!\" she said, tremulously, with a different smile from any\nVenters had ever seen on her face.\n\nLassiter took her into his arms.\n\n\"I reckon. It's powerful fine to hear that,\" replied Lassiter,\nunsteadily.\n\nVenters, feeling his eyes grow hot and wet, turned away, and found\nhimself looking at Jane Withersteen. He had almost forgotten her\npresence. Tenderness and sympathy were fast hiding traces of her\nagitation. Venters read her mind--felt the reaction of her noble\nheart--saw the joy she was beginning to feel at the happiness of others.\nAnd suddenly blinded, choked by his emotions, he turned from her also.\nHe knew what she would do presently; she would make some magnificent\namend for her anger; she would give some manifestation of her love;\nprobably all in a moment, as she had loved Milly Erne, so would she love\nElizabeth Erne.\n\n\"'Pears to me, folks, that we'd better talk a little serious now,\"\nremarked Lassiter, at length. \"Time flies.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" replied Venters, instantly. \"I'd forgotten\ntime--place--danger. Lassiter, you're riding away. Jane's leaving\nWithersteen House?\"\n\n\"Forever,\" replied Jane.\n\n\"I fired Withersteen House,\" said Lassiter.\n\n\"Dyer?\" questioned Venters, sharply.\n\n\"I reckon where Dyer's gone there won't be any kidnappin' of girls.\"\n\n\"Ah! I knew it. I told Judkins--And Tull?\" went on Venters,\npassionately.\n\n\"Tull wasn't around when I broke loose. By now he's likely on our trail\nwith his riders.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, you're going into the Pass to hide till all this storm blows\nover?\"\n\n\"I reckon that's Jane's idea. I'm thinkin' the storm'll be a powerful\nlong time blowin' over. I was comin' to join you in Surprise Valley.\nYou'll go back now with me?\"\n\n\"No. I want to take Bess out of Utah. Lassiter, Bess found gold in the\nvalley. We've a saddle-bag full of gold. If we can reach Sterling--\"\n\n\"Man! how're you ever goin' to do that? Sterlin' is a hundred miles.\"\n\n\"My plan is to ride on, keeping sharp lookout. Somewhere up the trail\nwe'll take to the sage and go round Cottonwoods and then hit the trail\nagain.\"\n\n\"It's a bad plan. You'll kill the burros in two days.\"\n\n\"Then we'll walk.\"\n\n\"That's more bad an' worse. Better go back down the Pass with me.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, this girl has been hidden all her life in that lonely place,\"\nwent on Venters. \"Oldring's men are hunting me. We'd not be safe there\nany longer. Even if we would be I'd take this chance to get her out.\nI want to marry her. She shall have some of the pleasures of life--see\ncities and people. We've gold--we'll be rich. Why, life opens sweet\nfor both of us. And, by Heaven! I'll get her out or lose my life in the\nattempt!\"\n\n\"I reckon if you go on with them burros you'll lose your life all right.\nTull will have riders all over this sage. You can't get out on them\nburros. It's a fool idea. That's not doin' best by the girl. Come with\nme en' take chances on the rustlers.\"\n\nLassiter's cool argument made Venters waver, not in determination to go,\nbut in hope of success.\n\n\"Bess, I want you to know. Lassiter says the trip's almost useless now.\nI'm afraid he's right. We've got about one chance in a hundred to go\nthrough. Shall we take it? Shall we go on?\"\n\n\"We'll go on,\" replied Bess.\n\n\"That settles it, Lassiter.\"\n\nLassiter spread wide his hands, as if to signify he could do no more,\nand his face clouded.\n\nVenters felt a touch on his elbow. Jane stood beside him with a hand\non his arm. She was smiling. Something radiated from her, and like an\nelectric current accelerated the motion of his blood.\n\n\"Bern, you'd be right to die rather than not take Elizabeth out of\nUtah--out of this wild country. You must do it. You'll show her the\ngreat world, with all its wonders. Think how little she has seen! Think\nwhat delight is in store for her! You have gold, You will be free; you\nwill make her happy. What a glorious prospect! I share it with you. I'll\nthink of you--dream of you--pray for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Jane,\" replied Venters, trying to steady his voice. \"It does\nlook bright. Oh, if we were only across that wide, open waste of sage!\"\n\n\"Bern, the trip's as good as made. It'll be safe--easy. It'll be a\nglorious ride,\" she said, softly.\n\nVenters stared. Had Jane's troubles made her insane? Lassiter, too,\nacted queerly, all at once beginning to turn his sombrero round in hands\nthat actually shook.\n\n\"You are a rider. She is a rider. This will be the ride of your lives,\"\nadded Jane, in that same soft undertone, almost as if she were musing to\nherself.\n\n\"Jane!\" he cried.\n\n\"I give you Black Star and Night!\"\n\n\"Black Star and Night!\" he echoed.\n\n\"It's done. Lassiter, put our saddle-bags on the burros.\"\n\nOnly when Lassiter moved swiftly to execute her bidding did Venters's\nclogged brain grasp at literal meanings. He leaped to catch Lassiter's\nbusy hands.\n\n\"No, no! What are you doing?\" he demanded, in a kind of fury. \"I won't\ntake her racers. What do you think I am? It'd be monstrous. Lassiter!\nstop it, I say!... You've got her to save. You've miles and miles to go.\nTull is trailing you. There are rustlers in the Pass. Give me back that\nsaddle-bag!\"\n\n\"Son--cool down,\" returned Lassiter, in a voice he might have used to a\nchild. But the grip with which he tore away Venters's grasping hands was\nthat of a giant. \"Listen--you fool boy! Jane's sized up the situation.\nThe burros'll do for us. We'll sneak along an' hide. I'll take your dogs\nan' your rifle. Why, it's the trick. The blacks are yours, an' sure as I\ncan throw a gun you're goin' to ride safe out of the sage.\"\n\n\"Jane--stop him--please stop him,\" gasped Venters. \"I've lost my\nstrength. I can't do--anything. This is hell for me! Can't you see that?\nI've ruined you--it was through me you lost all. You've only Black Star\nand Night left. You love these horses. Oh! I know how you must love them\nnow! And--you're trying to give them to me. To help me out of Utah! To\nsave the girl I love!\"\n\n\"That will be my glory.\"\n\nThen in the white, rapt face, in the unfathomable eyes, Venters saw Jane\nWithersteen in a supreme moment. This moment was one wherein she reached\nup to the height for which her noble soul had ever yearned. He, after\ndisrupting the calm tenor of her peace, after bringing down on her head\nthe implacable hostility of her churchmen, after teaching her a bitter\nlesson of life--he was to be her salvation. And he turned away again,\nthis time shaken to the core of his soul. Jane Withersteen was the\nincarnation of selflessness. He experienced wonder and terror, exquisite\npain and rapture. What were all the shocks life had dealt him compared\nto the thought of such loyal and generous friendship?\n\nAnd instantly, as if by some divine insight, he knew himself in the\nremaking--tried, found wanting; but stronger, better, surer--and he\nwheeled to Jane Withersteen, eager, joyous, passionate, wild, exalted.\nHe bent to her; he left tears and kisses on her hands.\n\n\"Jane, I--I can't find words--now,\" he said. \"I'm beyond words. Only--I\nunderstand. And I'll take the blacks.\"\n\n\"Don't be losin' no more time,\" cut in Lassiter. \"I ain't certain, but\nI think I seen a speck up the sage-slope. Mebbe I was mistaken. But,\nanyway, we must all be movin'. I've shortened the stirrups on Black\nStar. Put Bess on him.\"\n\nJane Withersteen held out her arms.\n\n\"Elizabeth Erne!\" she cried, and Bess flew to her.\n\nHow inconceivably strange and beautiful it was for Venters to see Bess\nclasped to Jane Withersteen's breast!\n\nThen he leaped astride Night.\n\n\"Venters, ride straight on up the slope,\" Lassiter was saying, \"'an\nif you don't meet any riders keep on till you're a few miles from the\nvillage, then cut off in the sage an' go round to the trail. But you'll\nmost likely meet riders with Tull. Jest keep right on till you're jest\nout of gunshot an' then make your cut-off into the sage. They'll ride\nafter you, but it won't be no use. You can ride, an' Bess can ride.\nWhen you're out of reach turn on round to the west, an' hit the trail\nsomewhere. Save the hosses all you can, but don't be afraid. Black Star\nand Night are good for a hundred miles before sundown, if you have to\npush them. You can get to Sterlin' by night if you want. But better make\nit along about to-morrow mornin'. When you get through the notch on the\nGlaze trail, swing to the right. You'll be able to see both Glaze an'\nStone Bridge. Keep away from them villages. You won't run no risk of\nmeetin' any of Oldrin's rustlers from Sterlin' on. You'll find water in\nthem deep hollows north of the Notch. There's an old trail there, not\nmuch used, en' it leads to Sterlin'. That's your trail. An' one thing\nmore. If Tull pushes you--or keeps on persistent-like, for a few\nmiles--jest let the blacks out an' lose him an' his riders.\"\n\n\"Lassiter, may we meet again!\" said Venters, in a deep voice.\n\n\"Son, it ain't likely--it ain't likely. Well, Bess Oldrin'--Masked\nRider--Elizabeth Erne--now you climb on Black Star. I've heard you could\nride. Well, every rider loves a good horse. An', lass, there never was\nbut one that could beat Black Star.\"\n\n\"Ah, Lassiter, there never was any horse that could beat Black Star,\"\nsaid Jane, with the old pride.\n\n\"I often wondered--mebbe Venters rode out that race when he brought back\nthe blacks. Son, was Wrangle the best hoss?\"\n\n\"No, Lassiter,\" replied Venters. For this lie he had his reward in\nJane's quick smile.\n\n\"Well, well, my hoss-sense ain't always right. An' here I'm talkin' a\nlot, wastin' time. It ain't so easy to find an' lose a pretty niece all\nin one hour! Elizabeth--good-by!\"\n\n\"Oh, Uncle Jim!... Good-by!\"\n\n\"Elizabeth Erne, be happy! Good-by,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Good-by--oh--good-by!\" In lithe, supple action Bess swung up to Black\nStar's saddle.\n\n\"Jane Withersteen!... Good-by!\" called Venters hoarsely.\n\n\"Bern--Bess--riders of the purple sage--good-by!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE\n\nBlack Star and Night, answering to spur, swept swiftly westward along\nthe white, slow-rising, sage-bordered trail. Venters heard a mournful\nhowl from Ring, but Whitie was silent. The blacks settled into their\nfleet, long-striding gallop. The wind sweetly fanned Venters's hot face.\nFrom the summit of the first low-swelling ridge he looked back. Lassiter\nwaved his hand; Jane waved her scarf. Venters replied by standing in his\nstirrups and holding high his sombrero. Then the dip of the ridge hid\nthem. From the height of the next he turned once more. Lassiter, Jane,\nand the burros had disappeared. They had gone down into the Pass.\nVenters felt a sensation of irreparable loss.\n\n\"Bern--look!\" called Bess, pointing up the long slope.\n\nA small, dark, moving dot split the line where purple sage met blue sky.\nThat dot was a band of riders.\n\n\"Pull the black, Bess.\"\n\nThey slowed from gallop to canter, then to trot. The fresh and eager\nhorses did not like the check.\n\n\"Bern, Black Star has great eyesight.\"\n\n\"I wonder if they're Tull's riders. They might be rustlers. But it's all\nthe same to us.\"\n\nThe black dot grew to a dark patch moving under low dust clouds. It grew\nall the time, though very slowly. There were long periods when it was in\nplain sight, and intervals when it dropped behind the sage. The blacks\ntrotted for half an hour, for another half-hour, and still the moving\npatch appeared to stay on the horizon line. Gradually, however, as time\npassed, it began to enlarge, to creep down the slope, to encroach upon\nthe intervening distance.\n\n\"Bess, what do you make them out?\" asked Venters. \"I don't think they're\nrustlers.\"\n\n\"They're sage-riders,\" replied Bess. \"I see a white horse and several\ngrays. Rustlers seldom ride any horses but bays and blacks.\"\n\n\"That white horse is Tull's. Pull the black, Bess. I'll get down and\ncinch up. We're in for some riding. Are you afraid?\"\n\n\"Not now,\" answered the girl, smiling.\n\n\"You needn't be. Bess, you don't weigh enough to make Black Star know\nyou're on him. I won't be able to stay with you. You'll leave Tull and\nhis riders as if they were standing still.\"\n\n\"How about you?\"\n\n\"Never fear. If I can't stay with you I can still laugh at Tull.\"\n\n\"Look, Bern! They've stopped on that ridge. They see us.\"\n\n\"Yes. But we're too far yet for them to make out who we are. They'll\nrecognize the blacks first. We've passed most of the ridges and the\nthickest sage. Now, when I give the word, let Black Star go and ride!\"\n\nVenters calculated that a mile or more still intervened between them\nand the riders. They were approaching at a swift canter. Soon Venters\nrecognized Tull's white horse, and concluded that the riders had\nlikewise recognized Black Star and Night. But it would be impossible for\nTull yet to see that the blacks were not ridden by Lassiter and Jane.\nVenters noted that Tull and the line of horsemen, perhaps ten or twelve\nin number, stopped several times and evidently looked hard down the\nslope. It must have been a puzzling circumstance for Tull. Venters\nlaughed grimly at the thought of what Tull's rage would be when he\nfinally discovered the trick. Venters meant to sheer out into the sage\nbefore Tull could possibly be sure who rode the blacks.\n\nThe gap closed to a distance of half a mile. Tull halted. His riders\ncame up and formed a dark group around him. Venters thought he saw him\nwave his arms and was certain of it when the riders dashed into the\nsage, to right and left of the trail. Tull had anticipated just the move\nheld in mind by Venters.\n\n\"Now Bess!\" shouted Venters. \"Strike north. Go round those riders and\nturn west.\"\n\nBlack Star sailed over the low sage, and in a few leaps got into his\nstride and was running. Venters spurred Night after him. It was hard\ngoing in the sage. The horses could run as well there, but keen eyesight\nand judgment must constantly be used by the riders in choosing ground.\nAnd continuous swerving from aisle to aisle between the brush, and\nleaping little washes and mounds of the pack-rats, and breaking through\nsage, made rough riding. When Venters had turned into a long aisle he\nhad time to look up at Tull's riders. They were now strung out into an\nextended line riding northeast. And, as Venters and Bess were holding\ndue north, this meant, if the horses of Tull and his riders had the\nspeed and the staying power, they would head the blacks and turn them\nback down the slope. Tull's men were not saving their mounts; they were\ndriving them desperately. Venters feared only an accident to Black Star\nor Night, and skilful riding would mitigate possibility of that. One\nglance ahead served to show him that Bess could pick a course through\nthe sage as well as he. She looked neither back nor at the running\nriders, and bent forward over Black Star's neck and studied the ground\nahead.\n\nIt struck Venters, presently, after he had glanced up from time to time,\nthat Bess was drawing away from him as he had expected. He had, however,\nonly thought of the light weight Black Star was carrying and of his\nsuperior speed; he saw now that the black was being ridden as never\nbefore, except when Jerry Card lost the race to Wrangle. How easily,\ngracefully, naturally, Bess sat her saddle! She could ride! Suddenly\nVenters remembered she had said she could ride. But he had not dreamed\nshe was capable of such superb horsemanship. Then all at once, flashing\nover him, thrilling him, came the recollection that Bess was Oldring's\nMasked Rider.\n\nHe forgot Tull--the running riders--the race. He let Night have a free\nrein and felt him lengthen out to suit himself, knowing he would keep to\nBlack Star's course, knowing that he had been chosen by the best rider\nnow on the upland sage. For Jerry Card was dead. And fame had rivaled\nhim with only one rider, and that was the slender girl who now swung so\neasily with Black Star's stride. Venters had abhorred her notoriety, but\nnow he took passionate pride in her skill, her daring, her power over\na horse. And he delved into his memory, recalling famous rides which he\nhad heard related in the villages and round the camp-fires. Oldring's\nMasked Rider! Many times this strange rider, at once well known and\nunknown, had escaped pursuers by matchless riding. He had to run the\ngantlet of vigilantes down the main street of Stone Bridge, leaving dead\nhorses and dead rustlers behind. He had jumped his horse over the Gerber\nWash, a deep, wide ravine separating the fields of Glaze from the\nwild sage. He had been surrounded north of Sterling; and he had broken\nthrough the line. How often had been told the story of day stampedes,\nof night raids, of pursuit, and then how the Masked Rider, swift as the\nwind, was gone in the sage! A fleet, dark horse--a slender, dark form--a\nblack mask--a driving run down the slope--a dot on the purple sage--a\nshadowy, muffled steed disappearing in the night!\n\nAnd this Masked Rider of the uplands had been Elizabeth Erne!\n\nThe sweet sage wind rushed in Venters's face and sang a song in his\nears. He heard the dull, rapid beat of Night's hoofs; he saw Black Star\ndrawing away, farther and farther. He realized both horses were swinging\nto the west. Then gunshots in the rear reminded him of Tull. Venters\nlooked back. Far to the side, dropping behind, trooped the riders. They\nwere shooting. Venters saw no puffs or dust, heard no whistling bullets.\nHe was out of range. When he looked back again Tull's riders had given\nup pursuit. The best they could do, no doubt, had been to get near\nenough to recognize who really rode the blacks. Venters saw Tull\ndrooping in his saddle.\n\nThen Venters pulled Night out of his running stride. Those few miles had\nscarcely warmed the black, but Venters wished to save him. Bess turned,\nand, though she was far away, Venters caught the white glint of her\nwaving hand. He held Night to a trot and rode on, seeing Bess and Black\nStar, and the sloping upward stretch of sage, and from time to time the\nreceding black riders behind. Soon they disappeared behind a ridge, and\nhe turned no more. They would go back to Lassiter's trail and follow it,\nand follow in vain. So Venters rode on, with the wind growing sweeter\nto taste and smell, and the purple sage richer and the sky bluer in his\nsight; and the song in his ears ringing. By and by Bess halted to wait\nfor him, and he knew she had come to the trail. When he reached her it\nwas to smile at sight of her standing with arms round Black Star's neck.\n\n\"Oh, Bern! I love him!\" she cried. \"He's beautiful; he knows; and how\nhe can run! I've had fast horses. But Black Star!... Wrangle never beat\nhim!\"\n\n\"I'm wondering if I didn't dream that. Bess, the blacks are grand. What\nit must have cost Jane--ah!--well, when we get out of this wild country\nwith Star and Night, back to my old home in Illinois, we'll buy a\nbeautiful farm with meadows and springs and cool shade. There we'll turn\nthe horses free--free to roam and browse and drink--never to feel a spur\nagain--never to be ridden!\"\n\n\"I would like that,\" said Bess.\n\nThey rested. Then, mounting, they rode side by side up the white trail.\nThe sun rose higher behind them. Far to the left a low line of green\nmarked the site of Cottonwoods. Venters looked once and looked no\nmore. Bess gazed only straight ahead. They put the blacks to the\nlong, swinging rider's canter, and at times pulled them to a trot, and\noccasionally to a walk. The hours passed, the miles slipped behind, and\nthe wall of rock loomed in the fore. The Notch opened wide. It was a\nrugged, stony pass, but with level and open trail, and Venters and Bess\nran the blacks through it. An old trail led off to the right, taking\nthe line of the wall, and this Venters knew to be the trail mentioned by\nLassiter.\n\nThe little hamlet, Glaze, a white and green patch in the vast waste of\npurple, lay miles down a slope much like the Cottonwoods slope, only\nthis descended to the west. And miles farther west a faint green spot\nmarked the location of Stone Bridge. All the rest of that world was\nseemingly smooth, undulating sage, with no ragged lines of canyons to\naccentuate its wildness.\n\n\"Bess, we're safe--we're free!\" said Venters. \"We're alone on the sage.\nWe're half way to Sterling.\"\n\n\"Ah! I wonder how it is with Lassiter and Miss Withersteen.\"\n\n\"Never fear, Bess. He'll outwit Tull. He'll get away and hide her\nsafely. He might climb into Surprise Valley, but I don't think he'll go\nso far.\"\n\n\"Bern, will we ever find any place like our beautiful valley?\"\n\n\"No. But, dear, listen. Well go back some day, after years--ten years.\nThen we'll be forgotten. And our valley will be just as we left it.\"\n\n\"What if Balancing Rock falls and closes the outlet to the Pass?\"\n\n\"I've thought of that. I'll pack in ropes and ropes. And if the outlet's\nclosed we'll climb up the cliffs and over them to the valley and go down\non rope ladders. It could be done. I know just where to make the climb,\nand I'll never forget.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, let us go back!\"\n\n\"It's something sweet to look forward to. Bess, it's like all the future\nlooks to me.\"\n\n\"Call me--Elizabeth,\" she said, shyly.\n\n\"Elizabeth Erne! It's a beautiful name. But I'll never forget Bess. Do\nyou know--have you thought that very soon--by this time to-morrow--you\nwill be Elizabeth Venters?\"\n\nSo they rode on down the old trail. And the sun sloped to the west, and\na golden sheen lay on the sage. The hours sped now; the afternoon waned.\nOften they rested the horses. The glisten of a pool of water in a hollow\ncaught Venters's eye, and here he unsaddled the blacks and let them roll\nand drink and browse. When he and Bess rode up out of the hollow the sun\nwas low, a crimson ball, and the valley seemed veiled in purple fire\nand smoke. It was that short time when the sun appeared to rest before\nsetting, and silence, like a cloak of invisible life, lay heavy on all\nthat shimmering world of sage.\n\nThey watched the sun begin to bury its red curve under the dark horizon.\n\n\"We'll ride on till late,\" he said. \"Then you can sleep a little,\nwhile I watch and graze the horses. And we'll ride into Sterling early\nto-morrow. We'll be married!... We'll be in time to catch the stage.\nWe'll tie Black Star and Night behind--and then--for a country not wild\nand terrible like this!\"\n\n\"Oh, Bern!... But look! The sun is setting on the sage--the last time\nfor us till we dare come again to the Utah border. Ten years! Oh, Bern,\nlook, so you will never forget!\"\n\nSlumbering, fading purple fire burned over the undulating sage ridges.\nLong streaks and bars and shafts and spears fringed the far western\nslope. Drifting, golden veils mingled with low, purple shadows. Colors\nand shades changed in slow, wondrous transformation.\n\nSuddenly Venters was startled by a low, rumbling roar--so low that it\nwas like the roar in a sea-shell.\n\n\"Bess, did you hear anything?\" he whispered.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Listen!... Maybe I only imagined--Ah!\"\n\nOut of the east or north from remote distance, breathed an infinitely\nlow, continuously long sound--deep, weird, detonating, thundering,\ndeadening--dying.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE FALL OF BALANCING ROCK\n\nThrough tear-blurred sight Jane Withersteen watched Venters and\nElizabeth Erne and the black racers disappear over the ridge of sage.\n\n\"They're gone!\" said Lassiter. \"An' they're safe now. An' there'll never\nbe a day of their comin' happy lives but what they'll remember Jane\nWithersteen an'--an' Uncle Jim!... I reckon, Jane, we'd better be on our\nway.\"\n\nThe burros obediently wheeled and started down the break with little\ncautious steps, but Lassiter had to leash the whining dogs and lead\nthem. Jane felt herself bound in a feeling that was neither listlessness\nnor indifference, yet which rendered her incapable of interest. She was\nstill strong in body, but emotionally tired. That hour at the entrance\nto Deception Pass had been the climax of her suffering--the flood of\nher wrath--the last of her sacrifice--the supremity of her love--and the\nattainment of peace. She thought that if she had little Fay she would\nnot ask any more of life.\n\nLike an automaton she followed Lassiter down the steep trail of dust and\nbits of weathered stone; and when the little slides moved with her or\npiled around her knees she experienced no alarm. Vague relief came to\nher in the sense of being enclosed between dark stone walls, deep hidden\nfrom the glare of sun, from the glistening sage. Lassiter lengthened the\nstirrup straps on one of the burros and bade her mount and ride close\nto him. She was to keep the burro from cracking his little hard hoofs on\nstones. Then she was riding on between dark, gleaming walls. There were\nquiet and rest and coolness in this canyon. She noted indifferently that\nthey passed close under shady, bulging shelves of cliff, through patches\nof grass and sage and thicket and groves of slender trees, and over\nwhite, pebbly washes, and around masses of broken rock. The burros\ntrotted tirelessly; the dogs, once more free, pattered tirelessly; and\nLassiter led on with never a stop, and at every open place he looked\nback. The shade under the walls gave place to sunlight. And presently\nthey came to a dense thicket of slender trees, through which they passed\nto rich, green grass and water. Here Lassiter rested the burros for a\nlittle while, but he was restless, uneasy, silent, always listening,\npeering under the trees. She dully reflected that enemies were behind\nthem--before them; still the thought awakened no dread or concern or\ninterest.\n\nAt his bidding she mounted and rode on close to the heels of his burro.\nThe canyon narrowed; the walls lifted their rugged rims higher; and\nthe sun shone down hot from the center of the blue stream of sky above.\nLassiter traveled slower, with more exceeding care as to the ground\nhe chose, and he kept speaking low to the dogs. They were now\nhunting-dogs--keen, alert, suspicious, sniffing the warm breeze.\nThe monotony of the yellow walls broke in change of color and smooth\nsurface, and the rugged outline of rims grew craggy. Splits appeared\nin deep breaks, and gorges running at right angles, and then the Pass\nopened wide at a junction of intersecting canyons.\n\nLassiter dismounted, led his burro, called the dogs close, and proceeded\nat snail pace through dark masses of rock and dense thickets under the\nleft wall. Long he watched and listened before venturing to cross the\nmouths of side canyons. At length he halted, tied his burro, lifted a\nwarning hand to Jane, and then slipped away among the boulders, and,\nfollowed by the stealthy dogs, disappeared from sight. The time he\nremained absent was neither short nor long to Jane Withersteen.\n\nWhen he reached her side again he was pale, and his lips were set in a\nhard line, and his gray eyes glittered coldly. Bidding her dismount, he\nled the burros into a covert of stones and cedars, and tied them.\n\n\"Jane, I've run into the fellers I've been lookin' for, an' I'm goin'\nafter them,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" she asked.\n\n\"I reckon I won't take time to tell you.\"\n\n\"Couldn't we slip by without being seen?\"\n\n\"Likely enough. But that ain't my game. An' I'd like to know, in case I\ndon't come back, what you'll do.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\"\n\n\"I reckon you can go back to Tull. Or stay in the Pass an' be taken off\nby rustlers. Which'll you do?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I can't think very well. But I believe I'd rather be\ntaken off by rustlers.\"\n\nLassiter sat down, put his head in his hands, and remained for a few\nmoments in what appeared to be deep and painful thought. When he lifted\nhis face it was haggard, lined, cold as sculptured marble.\n\n\"I'll go. I only mentioned that chance of my not comin' back. I'm pretty\nsure to come.\"\n\n\"Need you risk so much? Must you fight more? Haven't you shed enough\nblood?\"\n\n\"I'd like to tell you why I'm goin',\" he continued, in coldness he had\nseldom used to her. She remarked it, but it was the same to her as if he\nhad spoken with his old gentle warmth. \"But I reckon I won't. Only, I'll\nsay that mercy an' goodness, such as is in you, though they're the grand\nthings in human nature, can't be lived up to on this Utah border. Life's\nhell out here. You think--or you used to think--that your religion made\nthis life heaven. Mebbe them scales on your eyes has dropped now. Jane,\nI wouldn't have you no different, an' that's why I'm going to try to\nhide you somewhere in this Pass. I'd like to hide many more women, for\nI've come to see there are more like you among your people. An' I'd like\nyou to see jest how hard an' cruel this border life is. It's bloody.\nYou'd think churches an' churchmen would make it better. They make it\nworse. You give names to things--bishops, elders, ministers, Mormonism,\nduty, faith, glory. You dream--or you're driven mad. I'm a man, an'\nI know. I name fanatics, followers, blind women, oppressors, thieves,\nranchers, rustlers, riders. An' we have--what you've lived through these\nlast months. It can't be helped. But it can't last always. An' remember\nthis--some day the border'll be better, cleaner, for the ways of ten like\nLassiter!\"\n\nShe saw him shake his tall form erect, look at her strangely and\nsteadfastly, and then, noiselessly, stealthily slip away amid the rocks\nand trees. Ring and Whitie, not being bidden to follow, remained with\nJane. She felt extreme weariness, yet somehow it did not seem to be of\nher body. And she sat down in the shade and tried to think. She saw a\ncreeping lizard, cactus flowers, the drooping burros, the resting dogs,\nan eagle high over a yellow crag. Once the meanest flower, a color,\nthe flight of the bee, or any living thing had given her deepest joy.\nLassiter had gone off, yielding to his incurable blood lust, probably\nto his own death; and she was sorry, but there was no feeling in her\nsorrow.\n\nSuddenly from the mouth of the canyon just beyond her rang out a clear,\nsharp report of a rifle. Echoes clapped. Then followed a piercingly\nhigh yell of anguish, quickly breaking. Again echoes clapped, in grim\nimitation. Dull revolver shots--hoarse yells--pound of hoofs--shrill\nneighs of horses--commingling of echoes--and again silence! Lassiter\nmust be busily engaged, thought Jane, and no chill trembled over her,\nno blanching tightened her skin. Yes, the border was a bloody place.\nBut life had always been bloody. Men were blood-spillers. Phases of the\nhistory of the world flashed through her mind--Greek and Roman wars,\ndark, mediaeval times, the crimes in the name of religion. On sea, on\nland, everywhere--shooting, stabbing, cursing, clashing, fighting men!\nGreed, power, oppression, fanaticism, love, hate, revenge, justice,\nfreedom--for these, men killed one another.\n\nShe lay there under the cedars, gazing up through the delicate lacelike\nfoliage at the blue sky, and she thought and wondered and did not care.\n\nMore rattling shots disturbed the noonday quiet. She heard a sliding of\nweathered rock, a hoarse shout of warning, a yell of alarm, again the\nclear, sharp crack of the rifle, and another cry that was a cry of\ndeath. Then rifle reports pierced a dull volley of revolver shots.\nBullets whizzed over Jane's hiding-place; one struck a stone and whined\naway in the air. After that, for a time, succeeded desultory shots; and\nthen they ceased under long, thundering fire from heavier guns.\n\nSooner or later, then, Jane heard the cracking of horses' hoofs on the\nstones, and the sound came nearer and nearer. Silence intervened until\nLassiter's soft, jingling step assured her of his approach. When he\nappeared he was covered with blood.\n\n\"All right, Jane,\" he said. \"I come back. An' don't worry.\"\n\nWith water from a canteen he washed the blood from his face and hands.\n\n\"Jane, hurry now. Tear my scarf in two, en' tie up these places. That\nhole through my hand is some inconvenient, worse 'n this at over my ear.\nThere--you're doin' fine! Not a bit nervous--no tremblin'. I reckon I\nain't done your courage justice. I'm glad you're brave jest now--you'll\nneed to be. Well, I was hid pretty good, enough to keep them from\nshootin' me deep, but they was slingin' lead close all the time. I used\nup all the rifle shells, an' en I went after them. Mebbe you heard. It\nwas then I got hit. Had to use up every shell in my own gun, an' they\ndid, too, as I seen. Rustlers an' Mormons, Jane! An' now I'm packin'\nfive bullet holes in my carcass, an' guns without shells. Hurry, now.\"\n\nHe unstrapped the saddle-bags from the burros, slipped the saddles and\nlet them lie, turned the burros loose, and, calling the dogs, led the\nway through stones and cedars to an open where two horses stood.\n\n\"Jane, are you strong?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think so. I'm not tired,\" Jane replied.\n\n\"I don't mean that way. Can you bear up?\"\n\n\"I think I can bear anything.\"\n\n\"I reckon you look a little cold an' thick. So I'm preparin' you.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"I didn't tell you why I jest had to go after them fellers. I couldn't\ntell you. I believe you'd have died. But I can tell you now--if you'll\nbear up under a shock?\"\n\n\"Go on, my friend.\"\n\n\"I've got little Fay! Alive--bad hurt--but she'll live!\"\n\nJane Withersteen's dead-locked feeling, rent by Lassiter's deep,\nquivering voice, leaped into an agony of sensitive life.\n\n\"Here,\" he added, and showed her where little Fay lay on the grass.\n\nUnable to speak, unable to stand, Jane dropped on her knees. By that\nlong, beautiful golden hair Jane recognized the beloved Fay. But Fay's\nloveliness was gone. Her face was drawn and looked old with grief. But\nshe was not dead--her heart beat--and Jane Withersteen gathered strength\nand lived again.\n\n\"You see I jest had to go after Fay,\" Lassiter was saying, as he knelt\nto bathe her little pale face. \"But I reckon I don't want no more\nchoices like the one I had to make. There was a crippled feller in that\nbunch, Jane. Mebbe Venters crippled him. Anyway, that's why they were\nholding up here. I seen little Fay first thing, en' was hard put to it\nto figure out a way to get her. An' I wanted hosses, too. I had to take\nchances. So I crawled close to their camp. One feller jumped a hoss with\nlittle Fay, an' when I shot him, of course she dropped. She's stunned\nan' bruised--she fell right on her head. Jane, she's comin' to! She\nain't bad hurt!\"\n\nFay's long lashes fluttered; her eyes opened. At first they seemed\nglazed over. They looked dazed by pain. Then they quickened, darkened,\nto shine with intelligence--bewilderment--memory--and sudden wonderful\njoy.\n\n\"Muvver--Jane!\" she whispered.\n\n\"Oh, little Fay, little Fay!\" cried Jane, lifting, clasping the child to\nher.\n\n\"Now, we've got to rustle!\" said Lassiter, in grim coolness. \"Jane, look\ndown the Pass!\"\n\nAcross the mounds of rock and sage Jane caught sight of a band of riders\nfiling out of the narrow neck of the Pass; and in the lead was a white\nhorse, which, even at a distance of a mile or more, she knew.\n\n\"Tull!\" she almost screamed.\n\n\"I reckon. But, Jane, we've still got the game in our hands. They're\nridin' tired hosses. Venters likely give them a chase. He wouldn't\nforget that. An' we've fresh hosses.\"\n\nHurriedly he strapped on the saddle-bags, gave quick glance to girths\nand cinches and stirrups, then leaped astride.\n\n\"Lift little Fay up,\" he said.\n\nWith shaking arms Jane complied.\n\n\"Get back your nerve, woman! This's life or death now. Mind that. Climb\nup! Keep your wits. Stick close to me. Watch where your hoss's goin' en'\nride!\"\n\nSomehow Jane mounted; somehow found strength to hold the reins, to spur,\nto cling on, to ride. A horrible quaking, craven fear possessed her\nsoul. Lassiter led the swift flight across the wide space, over washes,\nthrough sage, into a narrow canyon where the rapid clatter of hoofs\nrapped sharply from the walls. The wind roared in her ears; the gleaming\ncliffs swept by; trail and sage and grass moved under her. Lassiter's\nbandaged, blood-stained face turned to her; he shouted encouragement; he\nlooked back down the Pass; he spurred his horse. Jane clung on, spurring\nlikewise. And the horses settled from hard, furious gallop into a\nlong-striding, driving run. She had never ridden at anything like that\npace; desperately she tried to get the swing of the horse, to be of some\nhelp to him in that race, to see the best of the ground and guide\nhim into it. But she failed of everything except to keep her seat the\nsaddle, and to spur and spur. At times she closed her eyes unable to\nbear sight of Fay's golden curls streaming in the wind. She could not\npray; she could not rail; she no longer cared for herself. All of life,\nof good, of use in the world, of hope in heaven entered in Lassiter's\nride with little Fay to safety. She would have tried to turn the\niron-jawed brute she rode, she would have given herself to that\nrelentless, dark-browed Tull. But she knew Lassiter would turn with her,\nso she rode on and on.\n\nWhether that run was of moments or hours Jane Withersteen could not\ntell. Lassiter's horse covered her with froth that blew back in white\nstreams. Both horses ran their limit, were allowed slow down in time to\nsave them, and went on dripping, heaving, staggering.\n\n\"Oh, Lassiter, we must run--we must run!\"\n\nHe looked back, saying nothing. The bandage had blown from his head,\nand blood trickled down his face. He was bowing under the strain\nof injuries, of the ride, of his burden. Yet how cool and gay he\nlooked--how intrepid!\n\nThe horses walked, trotted, galloped, ran, to fall again to walk. Hours\nsped or dragged. Time was an instant--an eternity. Jane Withersteen felt\nhell pursuing her, and dared not look back for fear she would fall from\nher horse.\n\n\"Oh, Lassiter! Is he coming?\"\n\nThe grim rider looked over his shoulder, but said no word. Fay's golden\nhair floated on the breeze. The sun shone; the walls gleamed; the sage\nglistened. And then it seemed the sun vanished, the walls shaded, the\nsage paled. The horses walked--trotted--galloped--ran--to fall again\nto walk. Shadows gathered under shelving cliffs. The canyon turned,\nbrightened, opened into a long, wide, wall-enclosed valley. Again the\nsun, lowering in the west, reddened the sage. Far ahead round, scrawled\nstone appeared to block the Pass.\n\n\"Bear up, Jane, bear up!\" called Lassiter. \"It's our game, if you don't\nweaken.\"\n\n\"Lassiter! Go on--alone! Save little Fay!\"\n\n\"Only with you!\"\n\n\"Oh!--I'm a coward--a miserable coward! I can't fight or think or hope\nor pray! I'm lost! Oh, Lassiter, look back! Is he coming? I'll not--hold\nout--\"\n\n\"Keep your breath, woman, an' ride not for yourself or for me, but for\nFay!\"\n\nA last breaking run across the sage brought Lassiter's horse to a walk.\n\n\"He's done,\" said the rider.\n\n\"Oh, no--no!\" moaned Jane.\n\n\"Look back, Jane, look back. Three--four miles we've come across this\nvalley, en' no Tull yet in sight. Only a few more miles!\"\n\nJane looked back over the long stretch of sage, and found the narrow gap\nin the wall, out of which came a file of dark horses with a white horse\nin the lead. Sight of the riders acted upon Jane as a stimulant. The\nweight of cold, horrible terror lessened. And, gazing forward at the\ndogs, at Lassiter's limping horse, at the blood on his face, at the\nrocks growing nearer, last at Fay's golden hair, the ice left her veins,\nand slowly, strangely, she gained hold of strength that she believed\nwould see her to the safety Lassiter promised. And, as she gazed,\nLassiter's horse stumbled and fell.\n\nHe swung his leg and slipped from the saddle.\n\n\"Jane, take the child,\" he said, and lifted Fay up. Jane clasped her\narms suddenly strong. \"They're gainin',\" went on Lassiter, as he watched\nthe pursuing riders. \"But we'll beat 'em yet.\"\n\nTurning with Jane's bridle in his hand, he was about to start when he\nsaw the saddle-bag on the fallen horse.\n\n\"I've jest about got time,\" he muttered, and with swift fingers that\ndid not blunder or fumble he loosened the bag and threw it over his\nshoulder. Then he started to run, leading Jane's horse, and he ran, and\ntrotted, and walked, and ran again. Close ahead now Jane saw a rise of\nbare rock. Lassiter reached it, searched along the base, and, finding\na low place, dragged the weary horse up and over round, smooth stone.\nLooking backward, Jane saw Tull's white horse not a mile distant, with\nriders strung out in a long line behind him. Looking forward, she saw\nmore valley to the right, and to the left a towering cliff. Lassiter\npulled the horse and kept on.\n\nLittle Fay lay in her arms with wide-open eyes--eyes which were still\nshadowed by pain, but no longer fixed, glazed in terror. The golden\ncurls blew across Jane's lips; the little hands feebly clasped her arm;\na ghost of a troubled, trustful smile hovered round the sweet lips. And\nJane Withersteen awoke to the spirit of a lioness.\n\nLassiter was leading the horse up a smooth slope toward cedar trees of\ntwisted and bleached appearance. Among these he halted.\n\n\"Jane, give me the girl en' get down,\" he said. As if it wrenched him he\nunbuckled the empty black guns with a strange air of finality. He then\nreceived Fay in his arms and stood a moment looking backward. Tull's\nwhite horse mounted the ridge of round stone, and several bays or blacks\nfollowed. \"I wonder what he'll think when he sees them empty guns. Jane,\nbring your saddle-bag and climb after me.\"\n\nA glistening, wonderful bare slope, with little holes, swelled up and\nup to lose itself in a frowning yellow cliff. Jane closely watched her\nsteps and climbed behind Lassiter. He moved slowly. Perhaps he was only\nhusbanding his strength. But she saw drops of blood on the stone, and\nthen she knew. They climbed and climbed without looking back. Her breast\nlabored; she began to feel as if little points of fiery steel were\npenetrating her side into her lungs. She heard the panting of Lassiter\nand the quicker panting of the dogs.\n\n\"Wait--here,\" he said.\n\nBefore her rose a bulge of stone, nicked with little cut steps, and\nabove that a corner of yellow wall, and overhanging that a vast,\nponderous cliff.\n\nThe dogs pattered up, disappeared round the corner. Lassiter mounted\nthe steps with Fay, and he swayed like a drunken man, and he too\ndisappeared. But instantly he returned alone, and half ran, half slipped\ndown to her.\n\nThen from below pealed up hoarse shouts of angry men. Tull and several\nof his riders had reached the spot where Lassiter had parted with his\nguns.\n\n\"You'll need that breath--mebbe!\" said Lassiter, facing downward, with\nglittering eyes.\n\n\"Now, Jane, the last pull,\" he went on. \"Walk up them little steps. I'll\nfollow an' steady you. Don't think. Jest go. Little Fay's above. Her\neyes are open. She jest said to me, 'Where's muvver Jane?'\"\n\nWithout a fear or a tremor or a slip or a touch of Lassiter's hand Jane\nWithersteen walked up that ladder of cut steps.\n\nHe pushed her round the corner of the wall. Fay lay, with wide staring\neyes, in the shade of a gloomy wall. The dogs waited. Lassiter picked\nup the child and turned into a dark cleft. It zigzagged. It widened.\nIt opened. Jane was amazed at a wonderfully smooth and steep incline\nleading up between ruined, splintered, toppling walls. A red haze\nfrom the setting sun filled this passage. Lassiter climbed with slow,\nmeasured steps, and blood dripped from him to make splotches on the\nwhite stone. Jane tried not to step in his blood, but was compelled, for\nshe found no other footing. The saddle-bag began to drag her down; she\ngasped for breath, she thought her heart was bursting. Slower, slower\nyet the rider climbed, whistling as he breathed. The incline widened.\nHuge pinnacles and monuments of stone stood alone, leaning fearfully.\nRed sunset haze shone through cracks where the wall had split. Jane did\nnot look high, but she felt the overshadowing of broken rims above.\nShe felt that it was a fearful, menacing place. And she climbed on in\nheartrending effort. And she fell beside Lassiter and Fay at the top of\nthe incline in a narrow, smooth divide.\n\nHe staggered to his feet--staggered to a huge, leaning rock that rested\non a small pedestal. He put his hand on it--the hand that had been shot\nthrough--and Jane saw blood drip from the ragged hole. Then he fell.\n\n\"Jane--I--can't--do--it!\" he whispered.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Roll the--stone!... All my--life I've loved--to roll stones--en' now\nI--can't!\"\n\n\"What of it? You talk strangely. Why roll that stone?\"\n\n\"I planned to--fetch you here--to roll this stone. See! It'll smash the\ncrags--loosen the walls--close the outlet!\"\n\nAs Jane Withersteen gazed down that long incline, walled in by crumbling\ncliffs, awaiting only the slightest jar to make them fall asunder,\nshe saw Tull appear at the bottom and begin to climb. A rider followed\nhim--another--and another.\n\n\"See! Tull! The riders!\"\n\n\"Yes--they'll get us--now.\"\n\n\"Why? Haven't you strength left to roll the stone?\"\n\n\"Jane--it ain't that--I've lost my nerve!\"\n\n\"You!... Lassiter!\"\n\n\"I wanted to roll it--meant to--but I--can't. Venters's valley is down\nbehind here. We could--live there. But if I roll the stone--we're shut\nin for always. I don't dare. I'm thinkin' of you!\"\n\n\"Lassiter! Roll the stone!\" she cried.\n\nHe arose, tottering, but with set face, and again he placed the bloody\nhand on the Balancing Rock. Jane Withersteen gazed from him down the\npassageway. Tull was climbing. Almost, she thought, she saw his dark,\nrelentless face. Behind him more riders climbed. What did they mean for\nFay--for Lassiter--for herself?\n\n\"Roll the stone!... Lassiter, I love you!\"\n\nUnder all his deathly pallor, and the blood, and the iron of seared\ncheek and lined brow, worked a great change. He placed both hands on the\nrock and then leaned his shoulder there and braced his powerful body.\n\nROLL THE STONE!\n\nIt stirred, it groaned, it grated, it moved, and with a slow grinding,\nas of wrathful relief, began to lean. It had waited ages to fall, and\nnow was slow in starting. Then, as if suddenly instinct with life, it\nleaped hurtlingly down to alight on the steep incline, to bound more\nswiftly into the air, to gather momentum, to plunge into the lofty\nleaning crag below. The crag thundered into atoms. A wave of air--a\nsplitting shock! Dust shrouded the sunset red of shaking rims; dust\nshrouded Tull as he fell on his knees with uplifted arms. Shafts and\nmonuments and sections of wall fell majestically.\n\nFrom the depths there rose a long-drawn rumbling roar. The outlet to\nDeception Pass closed forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Riders of the Purple Sage, by Zane Grey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1300.txt or 1300.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/3\/0\/1300\/\n\nProduced by Bill Brewer and Rick Fane\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1353,"split":"test"}
