However, this does not deter him, and after hearing a rousing speech by General George Washington, he volunteers for further duty, this time at sea, where more ill fortune awaits him. Israel is captured by the British Navy and taken to England. Yet, he makes his escape, and this triggers a series of extraordinary events and meetings with remarkable people. Along the way, Israel encounters King George III, who takes a liking to the Yankee rebel and shelters him in Kew Gardens; Benjamin Franklin, who presses Israel into service as a spy; John Paul Jones, who invites Israel to join his crew aboard The Ranger; and Ethan Allen, whom Israel attempts to free from a British prison. Throughout these adventures, Israel Potter acquits himself bravely, but his patriotic valor does not bring him any closer to his dream of returning to America. After the war, Israel finds himself in London, where he descends into poverty. Finally, fifty years after he left his plough, he makes his way back to his beloved Berkshires. However, few things remain the same. Soon, Israel fades out of being, his name out of memory, and he dies on the same day the oldest oak on his native lands is blown down.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Israel Potter, by Herman Melville\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

For nearly the whole of the distance, you have the\ncontinual sensation of being upon some terrace in the moon. The feeling\nof the plain or the valley is never yours; scarcely the feeling of the\nearth. Unless by a sudden precipitation of the road you find yourself\nplunging into some gorge, you pass on, and on, and on, upon the crests\nor slopes of pastoral mountains, while far below, mapped out in its\nbeauty, the valley of the Housatonie lies endlessly along at your feet.\nOften, as your horse gaining some lofty level tract, flat as a table,\ntrots gayly over the almost deserted and sodded road, and your admiring\neye sweeps the broad landscape beneath, you seem to be Bootes driving in\nheaven. Save a potato field here and there, at long intervals, the whole\ncountry is either in wood or pasture. Horses, cattle and sheep are the\nprincipal inhabitants of these mountains. But all through the year lazy\ncolumns of smoke, rising from the depths of the forest, proclaim the\npresence of that half-outlaw, the charcoal-burner; while in early spring\nadded curls of vapor show that the maple sugar-boiler is also at work.\nBut as for farming as a regular vocation, there is not much of it here.\nAt any rate, no man by that means accumulates a fortune from this thin\nand rocky soil, all whose arable parts have long since been nearly\nexhausted.\n\nYet during the first settlement of the country, the region was not\nunproductive. Here it was that the original settlers came, acting upon\nthe principle well known to have regulated their choice of site, namely,\nthe high land in preference to the low, as less subject to the\nunwholesome miasmas generated by breaking into the rich valleys and\nalluvial bottoms of primeval regions. By degrees, however, they quitted\nthe safety of this sterile elevation, to brave the dangers of richer\nthough lower fields. So that, at the present day, some of those mountain\ntownships present an aspect of singular abandonment. Though they have\nnever known aught but peace and health, they, in one lesser aspect at\nleast, look like countries depopulated by plague and war. Every mile or\ntwo a house is passed untenanted. The strength of the frame-work of\nthese ancient buildings enables them long to resist the encroachments of\ndecay. Spotted gray and green with the weather-stain, their timbers seem\nto have lapsed back into their woodland original, forming part now of\nthe general picturesqueness of the natural scene. They are of\nextraordinary size, compared with modern farmhouses. One peculiar\nfeature is the immense chimney, of light gray stone, perforating the\nmiddle of the roof like a tower.\n\nOn all sides are seen the tokens of ancient industry. As stone abounds\nthroughout these mountains, that material was, for fences, as ready to\nthe hand as wood, besides being much more durable. Consequently the\nlandscape is intersected in all directions with walls of uncommon\nneatness and strength.\n\nThe number and length of these walls is not more surprising than the\nsize of some of the blocks comprising them. The very Titans seemed to\nhave been at work. That so small an army as the first settlers must\nneeds have been, should have taken such wonderful pains to enclose so\nungrateful a soil; that they should have accomplished such herculean\nundertakings with so slight prospect of reward; this is a consideration\nwhich gives us a significant hint of the temper of the men of the\nRevolutionary era.\n\nNor could a fitter country be found for the birthplace of the devoted\npatriot, Israel Potter.\n\nTo this day the best stone-wall builders, as the best wood-choppers,\ncome from those solitary mountain towns; a tall, athletic, and hardy\nrace, unerring with the axe as the Indian with the tomahawk; at\nstone-rolling, patient as Sisyphus, powerful as Samson.\n\nIn fine clear June days, the bloom of these mountains is beyond\nexpression delightful. Last visiting these heights ere she vanishes,\nSpring, like the sunset, flings her sweetest charms upon them. Each tuft\nof upland grass is musked like a bouquet with perfume. The balmy breeze\nswings to and fro like a censer. On one side the eye follows for the\nspace of an eagle's flight, the serpentine mountain chains, southwards\nfrom the great purple dome of Taconic--the St. Peter's of these\nhills--northwards to the twin summits of Saddleback, which is the\ntwo-steepled natural cathedral of Berkshire; while low down to the west\nthe Housatonie winds on in her watery labyrinth, through charming\nmeadows basking in the reflected rays from the hill-sides. At this\nseason the beauty of every thing around you populates the loneliness of\nyour way. You would not have the country more settled if you could.\nContent to drink in such loveliness at all your senses, the heart\ndesires no company but Nature.\n\nWith what rapture you behold, hovering over some vast hollow of the\nhills, or slowly drifting at an immense height over the far sunken\nHousatonie valley, some lordly eagle, who in unshared exaltation looks\ndown equally upon plain and mountain. Or you behold a hawk sallying from\nsome crag, like a Rhenish baron of old from his pinnacled castle, and\ndarting down towards the river for his prey. Or perhaps, lazily gliding\nabout in the zenith, this ruffian fowl is suddenly beset by a crow, who\nwith stubborn audacity pecks at him, and, spite of all his bravery,\nfinally persecutes him back to his stronghold. The otherwise dauntless\nbandit, soaring at his topmost height, must needs succumb to this sable\nimage of death. Nor are there wanting many smaller and less famous fowl,\nwho without contributing to the grandeur, yet greatly add to the beauty\nof the scene. The yellow-bird flits like a winged jonquil here and\nthere; like knots of violets the blue-birds sport in clusters upon the\ngrass; while hurrying from the pasture to the grove, the red robin seems\nan incendiary putting torch to the trees. Meanwhile the air is vocal\nwith their hymns, and your own soul joys in the general joy. Like a\nstranger in an orchestra, you cannot help singing yourself when all\naround you raise such hosannas.\n\nBut in autumn, those gay northerners, the birds, return to their\nsouthern plantations. The mountains are left bleak and sere. Solitude\nsettles down upon them in drizzling mists. The traveller is beset, at\nperilous turns, by dense masses of fog. He emerges for a moment into\nmore penetrable air; and passing some gray, abandoned house, sees the\nlofty vapors plainly eddy by its desolate door; just as from the plain\nyou may see it eddy by the pinnacles of distant and lonely heights. Or,\ndismounting from his frightened horse, he leads him down some scowling\nglen, where the road steeply dips among grim rocks, only to rise as\nabruptly again; and as he warily picks his way, uneasy at the menacing\nscene, he sees some ghost-like object looming through the mist at the\nroadside; and wending towards it, beholds a rude white stone, uncouthly\ninscribed, marking the spot where, some fifty or sixty years ago, some\nfarmer was upset in his wood-sled, and perished beneath the load.\n\nIn winter this region is blocked up with snow. Inaccessible and\nimpassable, those wild, unfrequented roads, which in August are\novergrown with high grass, in December are drifted to the arm-pit with\nthe white fleece from the sky. As if an ocean rolled between man and\nman, intercommunication is often suspended for weeks and weeks.\n\nSuch, at this day, is the country which gave birth to our hero:\nprophetically styled Israel by the good Puritans, his parents, since,\nfor more than forty years, poor Potter wandered in the wild wilderness\nof the world's extremest hardships and ills.\n\nHow little he thought, when, as a boy, hunting after his father's stray\ncattle among these New England hills he himself like a beast should be\nhunted through half of Old England, as a runaway rebel. Or, how could he\never have dreamed, when involved in the autumnal vapors of these\nmountains, that worse bewilderments awaited him three thousand miles\nacross the sea, wandering forlorn in the coal-foes of London. But so it\nwas destined to be. This little boy of the hills, born in sight of the\nsparkling Housatonic, was to linger out the best part of his life a\nprisoner or a pauper upon the grimy banks of the Thames.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE YOUTHFUL ADVENTURES OF ISRAEL.\n\n\nImagination will easily picture the rural day of the youth of Israel.\nLet us pass on to a less immature period.\n\nIt appears that he began his wanderings very early; moreover, that ere,\non just principles throwing off the yoke off his king, Israel, on\nequally excusable grounds, emancipated himself from his sire. He\ncontinued in the enjoyment of parental love till the age of eighteen,\nwhen, having formed an attachment for a neighbor's daughter--for some\nreason, not deemed a suitable match by his father--he was severely\nreprimanded, warned to discontinue his visits, and threatened with some\ndisgraceful punishment in case he persisted. As the girl was not only\nbeautiful, but amiable--though, as will be seen, rather weak--and her\nfamily as respectable as any, though unfortunately but poor, Israel\ndeemed his father's conduct unreasonable and oppressive; particularly as\nit turned out that he had taken secret means to thwart his son with the\ngirl's connections, if not with the girl herself, so as to place almost\ninsurmountable obstacles to an eventual marriage. For it had not been\nthe purpose of Israel to marry at once, but at a future day, when\nprudence should approve the step. So, oppressed by his father, and\nbitterly disappointed in his love, the desperate boy formed the\ndetermination to quit them both for another home and other friends.\n\nIt was on Sunday, while the family were gone to a farmhouse church near\nby, that he packed up as much of his clothing as might be contained in a\nhandkerchief, which, with a small quantity of provision, he hid in a\npiece of woods in the rear of the house. He then returned, and continued\nin the house till about nine in the evening, when, pretending to go to\nbed, he passed out of a back door, and hastened to the woods for his\nbundle.\n\nIt was a sultry night in July; and that he might travel with the more\nease on the succeeding day, he lay down at the foot of a pine tree,\nreposing himself till an hour before dawn, when, upon awaking, he heard\nthe soft, prophetic sighing of the pine, stirred by the first breath of\nthe morning. Like the leaflets of that evergreen, all the fibres of his\nheart trembled within him; tears fell from his eyes. But he thought of\nthe tyranny of his father, and what seemed to him the faithlessness of\nhis love; and shouldering his bundle, arose, and marched on.\n\nHis intention was to reach the new countries to the northward and\nwestward, lying between the Dutch settlements on the Hudson, and the\nYankee settlements on the Housatonic. This was mainly to elude all\nsearch. For the same reason, for the first ten or twelve miles,\nshunning the public roads, he travelled through the woods; for he knew\nthat he would soon be missed and pursued.\n\nHe reached his destination in safety; hired out to a farmer for a month\nthrough the harvest; then crossed from the Hudson to the Connecticut.\nMeeting here with an adventurer to the unknown regions lying about the\nhead waters of the latter river, he ascended with this man in a canoe,\npaddling and pulling for many miles. Here again he hired himself out for\nthree months; at the end of that time to receive for his wages two\nhundred acres of land lying in New Hampshire. The cheapness of the land\nwas not alone owing to the newness of the country, but to the perils\ninvesting it. Not only was it a wilderness abounding with wild beasts,\nbut the widely-scattered inhabitants were in continual dread of being,\nat some unguarded moment, destroyed or made captive by the Canadian\nsavages, who, ever since the French war, had improved every opportunity\nto make forays across the defenceless frontier.\n\nHis employer proving false to his contract in the matter of the land,\nand there being no law in the country to force him to fulfil it,\nIsrael--who, however brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a\npinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts of his\ncareer, a singular patience and mildness--was obliged to look round for\nother means of livelihood than clearing out a farm for himself in the\nwilderness. A party of royal surveyors were at this period surveying the\nunsettled regions bordering the Connecticut river to its source. At\nfifteen shillings per month, he engaged himself to this party as\nassistant chain-bearer, little thinking that the day was to come when he\nshould clank the king's chains in a dungeon, even as now he trailed them\na free ranger of the woods. It was midwinter; the land was surveyed upon\nsnow-shoes. At the close of the day, fires were kindled with dry\nhemlock, a hut thrown up, and the party ate and slept.\n\nPaid off at last, Israel bought a gun and ammunition, and turned\nhunter. Deer, beaver, etc., were plenty. In two or three months he had\nmany skins to show. I suppose it never entered his mind that he was thus\nqualifying himself for a marksman of men. But thus were tutored those\nwonderful shots who did such execution at Bunker's Hill; these, the\nhunter-soldiers, whom Putnam bade wait till the white of the enemy's eye\nwas seen.\n\nWith the result of his hunting he purchased a hundred acres of land,\nfurther down the river, toward the more settled parts; built himself a\nlog hut, and in two summers, with his own hands, cleared thirty acres\nfor sowing. In the winter seasons he hunted and trapped. At the end of\nthe two years, he sold back his land--now much improved--to the original\nowner, at an advance of fifty pounds. He conveyed his cash and furs to\nCharlestown, on the Connecticut (sometimes called No. 4), where he\ntrafficked them away for Indian blankets, pigments, and other showy\narticles adapted to the business of a trader among savages. It was now\nwinter again. Putting his goods on a hand-sled, he started towards\nCanada, a peddler in the wilderness, stopping at wigwams instead of\ncottages. One fancies that, had it been summer, Israel would have\ntravelled with a wheelbarrow, and so trundled his wares through the\nprimeval forests, with the same indifference as porters roll their\nbarrows over the flagging of streets. In this way was bred that fearless\nself-reliance and independence which conducted our forefathers to\nnational freedom.\n\nThis Canadian trip proved highly successful. Selling his glittering\ngoods at a great advance, he received in exchange valuable peltries and\nfurs at a corresponding reduction. Returning to Charlestown, he disposed\nof his return cargo again at a very fine profit. And now, with a light\nheart and a heavy purse, he resolved to visit his sweetheart and\nparents, of whom, for three years, he had had no tidings.\n\nThey were not less astonished than delighted at his reappearance; he had\nbeen numbered with the dead. But his love still seemed strangely coy;\nwilling, but yet somehow mysteriously withheld. The old intrigues were\nstill on foot. Israel soon discovered, that though rejoiced to welcome\nthe return of the prodigal son--so some called him--his father still\nremained inflexibly determined against the match, and still inexplicably\ncountermined his wooing. With a dolorous heart he mildly yielded to what\nseemed his fatality; and more intrepid in facing peril for himself, than\nin endangering others by maintaining his rights (for he was now\none-and-twenty), resolved once more to retreat, and quit his blue hills\nfor the bluer billows.\n\nA hermitage in the forest is the refuge of the narrow-minded\nmisanthrope; a hammock on the ocean is the asylum for the generous\ndistressed. The ocean brims with natural griefs and tragedies; and into\nthat watery immensity of terror, man's private grief is lost like a\ndrop.\n\nTravelling on foot to Providence, Rhode Island, Israel shipped on board\na sloop, bound with lime to the West Indies. On the tenth day out, the\nvessel caught fire, from water communicating with the lime. It was\nimpossible to extinguish the flames. The boat was hoisted out, but owing\nto long exposure to the sun, it needed continual bailing to keep it\nafloat. They had only time to put in a firkin of butter and a ten-gallon\nkeg of water. Eight in number, the crew entrusted themselves to the\nwaves, in a leaky tub, many leagues from land. As the boat swept under\nthe burning bowsprit, Israel caught at a fragment of the flying-jib,\nwhich sail had fallen down the stay, owing to the charring, nigh the\ndeck, of the rope which hoisted it. Tanned with the smoke, and its edge\nblackened with the fire, this bit of canvass helped them bravely on\ntheir way. Thanks to kind Providence, on the second day they were picked\nup by a Dutch ship, bound from Eustatia to Holland. The castaways were\nhumanely received, and supplied with every necessary. At the end of a\nweek, while unsophisticated Israel was sitting in the maintop, thinking\nwhat should befall him in Holland, and wondering what sort of unsettled,\nwild country it was, and whether there was any deer-shooting or\nbeaver-trapping there, lo! an American brig, bound from Piscataqua to\nAntigua, comes in sight. The American took them aboard, and conveyed\nthem safely to her port. There Israel shipped for Porto Rico; from\nthence, sailed to Eustatia.\n\nOther rovings ensued; until at last, entering on board a Nantucket ship,\nhe hunted the leviathan off the Western Islands and on the coast of\nAfrica, for sixteen months; returning at length to Nantucket with a\nbrimming hold. From that island he sailed again on another whaling\nvoyage, extending, this time, into the great South Sea. There, promoted\nto be harpooner, Israel, whose eye and arm had been so improved by\npractice with his gun in the wilderness, now further intensified his\naim, by darting the whale-lance; still, unwittingly, preparing himself\nfor the Bunker Hill rifle.\n\nIn this last voyage, our adventurer experienced to the extreme all the\nhardships and privations of the whaleman's life on a long voyage to\ndistant and barbarous waters--hardships and privations unknown at the\npresent day, when science has so greatly contributed, in manifold ways,\nto lessen the sufferings, and add to the comforts of seafaring men.\nHeartily sick of the ocean, and longing once more for the bush, Israel,\nupon receiving his discharge at Nantucket at the end of the voyage, hied\nstraight back for his mountain home.\n\nBut if hopes of his sweetheart winged his returning flight, such hopes\nwere not destined to be crowned with fruition. The dear, false girl was\nanother's.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nISRAEL GOES TO THE WARS; AND REACHING BUNKER HILL IN TIME TO BE OF\nSERVICE THERE, SOON AFTER IS FORCED TO EXTEND HIS TRAVELS ACROSS THE SEA\nINTO THE ENEMY'S LAND.\n\n\nLeft to idle lamentations, Israel might now have planted deep furrows in\nhis brow. But stifling his pain, he chose rather to plough, than be\nploughed. Farming weans man from his sorrows. That tranquil pursuit\ntolerates nothing but tranquil meditations. There, too, in mother earth,\nyou may plant and reap; not, as in other things, plant and see the\nplanting torn up by the roots. But if wandering in the wilderness, and\nwandering upon the waters, if felling trees, and hunting, and shipwreck,\nand fighting with whales, and all his other strange adventures, had not\nas yet cured poor Israel of his now hopeless passion, events were at\nhand for ever to drown it.\n\nIt was the year 1774. The difficulties long pending between the colonies\nand England were arriving at their crisis. Hostilities were certain. The\nAmericans were preparing themselves. Companies were formed in most of\nthe New England towns, whose members, receiving the name of minute-men,\nstood ready to march anywhere at a minute's warning. Israel, for the\nlast eight months, sojourning as a laborer on a farm in Windsor,\nenrolled himself in the regiment of Colonel John Patterson of Lenox,\nafterwards General Patterson.\n\nThe battle of Lexington was fought on the 18th of April, 1775; news of\nit arrived in the county of Berkshire on the 20th about noon. The next\nmorning at sunrise, Israel swung his knapsack, shouldered his musket,\nand, with Patterson's regiment, was on the march, quickstep, towards\nBoston.\n\nLike Putnam, Israel received the stirring tidings at the plough. But\nalthough not less willing than Putnam to fly to battle at an instant's\nnotice, yet--only half an acre of the field remaining to be finished--he\nwhipped up his team and finished it. Before hastening to one duty, he\nwould not leave a prior one undone; and ere helping to whip the British,\nfor a little practice' sake, he applied the gad to his oxen. From the\nfield of the farmer, he rushed to that of the soldier, mingling his\nblood with his sweat. While we revel in broadcloth, let us not forget\nwhat we owe to linsey-woolsey.\n\nWith other detachments from various quarters, Israel's regiment remained\nencamped for several days in the vicinity of Charlestown. On the\nseventeenth of June, one thousand Americans, including the regiment of\nPatterson, were set about fortifying Bunker's Hill. Working all through\nthe night, by dawn of the following day, the redoubt was thrown up. But\nevery one knows all about the battle. Suffice it, that Israel was one\nof those marksmen whom Putnam harangued as touching the enemy's eyes.\nForbearing as he was with his oppressive father and unfaithful love, and\nmild as he was on the farm, Israel was not the same at Bunker Hill.\nPutnam had enjoined the men to aim at the officers; so Israel aimed\nbetween the golden epaulettes, as, in the wilderness, he had aimed\nbetween the branching antlers. With dogged disdain of their foes, the\nEnglish grenadiers marched up the hill with sullen slowness; thus\nfurnishing still surer aims to the muskets which bristled on the\nredoubt. Modest Israel was used to aver, that considering his practice\nin the woods, he could hardly be regarded as an inexperienced marksman;\nhinting, that every shot which the epauletted grenadiers received from\nhis rifle, would, upon a different occasion, have procured him a\ndeerskin. And like stricken deers the English, rashly brave as they\nwere, fled from the opening fire. But the marksman's ammunition was\nexpended; a hand-to-hand encounter ensued. Not one American musket in\ntwenty had a bayonet to it. So, wielding the stock right and left, the\nterrible farmers, with hats and coats off, fought their way among the\nfurred grenadiers, knocking them right and left, as seal-hunters on the\nbeach knock down with their clubs the Shetland seal. In the dense crowd\nand confusion, while Israel's musket got interlocked, he saw a blade\nhorizontally menacing his feet from the ground. Thinking some fallen\nenemy sought to strike him at the last gasp, dropping his hold on his\nmusket, he wrenched at the steel, but found that though a brave hand\nheld it, that hand was powerless for ever. It was some British\nofficer's laced sword-arm, cut from the trunk in the act of fighting,\nrefusing to yield up its blade to the last. At that moment another sword\nwas aimed at Israel's head by a living officer. In an instant the blow\nwas parried by kindred steel, and the assailant fell by a brother's\nweapon, wielded by alien hands. But Israel did not come off unscathed. A\ncut on the right arm near the elbow, received in parrying the officer's\nblow, a long slit across the chest, a musket ball buried in his hip, and\nanother mangling him near the ankle of the same leg, were the tokens of\nintrepidity which our Sicinius Dentatus carried from this memorable\nfield. Nevertheless, with his comrades he succeeded in reaching Prospect\nHill, and from thence was conveyed to the hospital at Cambridge. The\nbullet was extracted, his lesser wounds were dressed, and after much\nsuffering from the fracture of the bone near the ankle, several pieces\nof which were extracted by the surgeon, ere long, thanks to the high\nhealth and pure blood of the farmer, Israel rejoined his regiment when\nthey were throwing up intrenchments on Prospect Hill. Bunker Hill was\nnow in possession of the foe, who in turn had fortified it.\n\nOn the third of July, Washington arrived from the South to take the\ncommand. Israel witnessed his joyful reception by the huzzaing\ncompanies.\n\nThe British now quartered in Boston suffered greatly from the scarcity\nof provisions. Washington took every precaution to prevent their\nreceiving a supply. Inland, all aid could easily be cut off. To guard\nagainst their receiving any by water, from tories and other disaffected\npersons, the General equipped three armed vessels to intercept all\ntraitorous cruisers. Among them was the brigantine Washington, of ten\nguns, commanded by Captain Martiedale. Seamen were hard to be had. The\nsoldiers were called upon to volunteer for these vessels. Israel was one\nwho so did; thinking that as an experienced sailor he should not be\nbackward in a juncture like this, little as he fancied the new service\nassigned.\n\nThree days out of Boston harbor, the brigantine was captured by the\nenemy's ship Foy, of twenty guns. Taken prisoner with the rest of the\ncrew, Israel was afterwards put on board the frigate Tartar, with\nimmediate sailing orders for England. Seventy-two were captives in this\nvessel. Headed by Israel, these men--half way across the sea--formed a\nscheme to take the ship, but were betrayed by a renegade Englishman. As\nringleader, Israel was put in irons, and so remained till the frigate\nanchored at Portsmouth. There he was brought on deck; and would have met\nperhaps some terrible fate, had it not come out, during the examination,\nthat the Englishman had been a deserter from the army of his native\ncountry ere proving a traitor to his adopted one. Relieved of his irons,\nIsrael was placed in the marine hospital on shore, where half of the\nprisoners took the small-pox, which swept off a third of their number.\nWhy talk of Jaffa?\n\nFrom the hospital the survivors were conveyed to Spithead, and thrust on\nboard a hulk. And here in the black bowels of the ship, sunk low in the\nsunless sea, our poor Israel lay for a month, like Jonah in the belly\nof the whale.\n\nBut one bright morning, Israel is hailed from the deck. A bargeman of\nthe commander's boat is sick. Known for a sailor, Israel for the nonce\nis appointed to pull the absent man's oar.\n\nThe officers being landed, some of the crew propose, like merry\nEnglishmen as they are, to hie to a neighboring ale-house, and have a\ncosy pot or two together. Agreed. They start, and Israel with them. As\nthey enter the ale-house door, our prisoner is suddenly reminded of\nstill more imperative calls. Unsuspected of any design, he is allowed to\nleave the party for a moment. No sooner does Israel see his companions\nhoused, than putting speed into his feet, and letting grow all his\nwings, he starts like a deer. He runs four miles (so he afterwards\naffirmed) without halting. He sped towards London; wisely deeming that\nonce in that crowd detection would be impossible.\n\nTen miles, as he computed, from where he had left the bargemen,\nleisurely passing a public house of a little village on the roadside,\nthinking himself now pretty safe--hark, what is this he hears?--\n\n\"Ahoy!\"\n\n\"No ship,\" says Israel, hurrying on.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\n\"If you will attend to your business, I will endeavor to attend to\nmine,\" replies Israel coolly. And next minute he lets grow his wings\nagain; flying, one dare say, at the rate of something less than thirty\nmiles an hour.\n\n\"Stop thief!\" is now the cry. Numbers rushed from the roadside houses.\nAfter a mile's chase, the poor panting deer is caught.\n\nFinding it was no use now to prevaricate, Israel boldly confesses\nhimself a prisoner-of-war. The officer, a good fellow as it turned out,\nhad him escorted back to the inn; where, observing to the landlord that\nthis must needs be a true-blooded Yankee, he calls for liquors to\nrefresh Israel after his run. Two soldiers are then appointed to guard\nhim for the present. This was towards evening; and up to a late hour at\nnight, the inn was filled with strangers crowding to see the Yankee\nrebel, as they politely termed him. These honest rustics seemed to think\nthat Yankees were a sort of wild creatures, a species of 'possum or\nkangaroo. But Israel is very affable with them. That liquor he drank\nfrom the hand of his foe, has perhaps warmed his heart towards all the\nrest of his enemies. Yet this may not be wholly so. We shall see. At any\nrate, still he keeps his eye on the main chance--escape. Neither the\njokes nor the insults of the mob does he suffer to molest him. He is\ncogitating a little plot to himself.\n\nIt seems that the good officer--not more true to the king his master\nthan indulgent towards the prisoner which that same loyalty made--had\nleft orders that Israel should be supplied with whatever liquor he\nwanted that night. So, calling for the can again and again, Israel\ninvites the two soldiers to drink and be merry. At length, a wag of the\ncompany proposes that Israel should entertain the public with a jig, he\n(the wag) having heard that the Yankees were extraordinary dancers. A\nfiddle is brought in, and poor Israel takes the floor. Not a little cut\nto think that these people should so unfeelingly seek to be diverted at\nthe expense of an unfortunate prisoner, Israel, while jigging it up and\ndown, still conspires away at his private plot, resolving ere long to\ngive the enemy a touch of certain Yankee steps, as yet undreamed of in\ntheir simple philosophy. They would not permit any cessation of his\ndancing till he had danced himself into a perfect sweat, so that the\ndrops fell from his lank and flaxen hair. But Israel, with much of the\ngentleness of the dove, is not wholly without the wisdom of the serpent.\nPleased to see the flowing bowl, he congratulates himself that his own\nstate of perspiration prevents it from producing any intoxicating effect\nupon him.\n\nLate at night the company break up. Furnished with a pair of handcuffs,\nthe prisoner is laid on a blanket spread upon the floor at the side of\nthe bed in which his two keepers are to repose. Expressing much\ngratitude for the blanket, with apparent unconcern, Israel stretches his\nlegs. An hour or two passes. All is quiet without.\n\nThe important moment had now arrived. Certain it was, that if this\nchance were suffered to pass unimproved, a second would hardly present\nitself. For early, doubtless, on the following morning, if not some way\nprevented, the two soldiers would convey Israel back to his floating\nprison, where he would thenceforth remain confined until the close of\nthe war; years and years, perhaps. When he thought of that horrible old\nhulk, his nerves were restrung for flight. But intrepid as he must be to\ncompass it, wariness too was needed. His keepers had gone to bed pretty\nwell under the influence of the liquor. This was favorable. But still,\nthey were full-grown, strong men; and Israel was handcuffed. So Israel\nresolved upon strategy first; and if that failed, force afterwards. He\neagerly listened. One of the drunken soldiers muttered in his sleep, at\nfirst lowly, then louder and louder,--\"Catch 'em! Grapple 'em! Have at\n'em! Ha--long cutlasses! Take that, runaway!\"\n\n\"What's the matter with ye, Phil?\" hiccoughed the other, who was not yet\nasleep. \"Keep quiet, will ye? Ye ain't at Fontenoy now.\"\n\n\"He's a runaway prisoner, I say. Catch him, catch him!\"\n\n\"Oh, stush with your drunken dreaming,\" again hiccoughed his comrade,\nviolently nudging him. \"This comes o' carousing.\"\n\nShortly after, the dreamer with loud snores fell back into dead sleep.\nBut by something in the sound of the breathing of the other soldier,\nIsrael knew that this man remained uneasily awake. He deliberated a\nmoment what was best to do. At length he determined upon trying his old\nplea. Calling upon the two soldiers, he informed them that urgent\nnecessity required his immediate presence somewhere in the rear of the\nhouse.\n\n\"Come, wake up here, Phil,\" roared the soldier who was awake; \"the\nfellow here says he must step out; cuss these Yankees; no better\nedication than to be gettin' up on nateral necessities at this time\no'night. It ain't nateral; its unnateral. D---n ye, Yankee, don't ye\nknow no better?\"\n\nWith many more denunciations, the two now staggered to their feet, and\nclutching hold of Israel, escorted him down stairs, and through a long,\nnarrow, dark entry; rearward, till they came to a door. No sooner\nwas this unbolted by the foremost guard, than, quick as a flash,\nmanacled Israel, shaking off the grasp of the one behind him, butts him\nsprawling back into the entry; when, dashing in the opposite direction,\nhe bounces the other head over heels into the garden, never using a\nhand; and then, leaping over the latter's head, darts blindly out into\nthe midnight. Next moment he was at the garden wall. No outlet was\ndiscoverable in the gloom. But a fruit-tree grew close to the wall.\nSpringing into it desperately, handcuffed as he was, Israel leaps atop\nof the barrier, and without pausing to see where he is, drops himself to\nthe ground on the other side, and once more lets grow all his wings.\nMeantime, with loud outcries, the two baffled drunkards grope\ndeliriously about in the garden.\n\nAfter running two or three miles, and hearing no sound of pursuit,\nIsrael reins up to rid himself of the handcuffs, which impede him. After\nmuch painful labor he succeeds in the attempt. Pressing on again with\nall speed, day broke, revealing a trim-looking, hedged, and beautiful\ncountry, soft, neat, and serene, all colored with the fresh early tints\nof the spring of 1776.\n\nBless me, thought Israel, all of a tremble, I shall certainly be caught\nnow; I have broken into some nobleman's park.\n\nBut, hurrying forward again, he came to a turnpike road, and then knew\nthat, all comely and shaven as it was, this was simply the open country\nof England; one bright, broad park, paled in with white foam of the\nsea. A copse skirting the road was just bursting out into bud. Each\nunrolling leaf was in very act of escaping from its prison. Israel\nlooked at the budding leaves, and round on the budding sod, and up at\nthe budding dawn of the day. He was so sad, and these sights were so\ngay, that Israel sobbed like a child, while thoughts of his mountain\nhome rushed like a wind on his heart. But conquering this fit, he\nmarched on, and presently passed nigh a field, where two figures were\nworking. They had rosy cheeks, short, sturdy legs, showing the blue\nstocking nearly to the knee, and were clad in long, coarse, white\nfrocks, and had on coarse, broad-brimmed straw hats. Their faces were\npartly averted.\n\n\"Please, ladies,\" half roguishly says Israel, taking off his hat, \"does\nthis road go to London?\"\n\nAt this salutation, the two figures turned in a sort of stupid\namazement, causing an almost corresponding expression in Israel, who now\nperceived that they were men, and not women. He had mistaken them, owing\nto their frocks, and their wearing no pantaloons, only breeches hidden\nby their frocks.\n\n\"Beg pardon, ladies, but I thought ye were something else,\" said Israel\nagain.\n\nOnce more the two figures stared at the stranger, and with added\nboorishness of surprise.\n\n\"Does this road go to London, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Gentlemen--egad!\" cried one of the two.\n\n\"Egad!\" echoed the second.\n\nPutting their hoes before them, the two frocked boors now took a good\nlong look at Israel, meantime scratching their heads under their plaited\nstraw hats.\n\n\"Does it, gentlemen? Does it go to London? Be kind enough to tell a poor\nfellow, do.\"\n\n\"Yees goin' to Lunnun, are yees? Weel--all right--go along.\"\n\nAnd without another word, having now satisfied their rustic curiosity,\nthe two human steers, with wonderful phlegm, applied themselves to their\nhoes; supposing, no doubt, that they had given all requisite\ninformation.\n\nShortly after, Israel passed an old, dark, mossy-looking chapel, its\nroof all plastered with the damp yellow dead leaves of the previous\nautumn, showered there from a close cluster of venerable trees, with\ngreat trunks, and overstretching branches. Next moment he found himself\nentering a village. The silence of early morning rested upon it. But few\nfigures were seen. Glancing through the window of a now noiseless\npublic-house, Israel saw a table all in disorder, covered with empty\nflagons, and tobacco-ashes, and long pipes; some of the latter broken.\n\nAfter pausing here a moment, he moved on, and observed a man over the\nway standing still and watching him. Instantly Israel was reminded that\nhe had on the dress of an English sailor, and that it was this probably\nwhich had arrested the stranger's attention. Well knowing that his\npeculiar dress exposed him to peril, he hurried on faster to escape the\nvillage; resolving at the first opportunity to change his garments. Ere\nlong, in a secluded place about a mile from the village, he saw an old\nditcher tottering beneath the weight of a pick-axe, hoe and shovel,\ngoing to his work; the very picture of poverty, toil and distress. His\nclothes were tatters.\n\nMaking up to this old man, Israel, after a word or two of salutation,\noffered to change clothes with him. As his own clothes were prince-like\ncompared to the ditchers, Israel thought that however much his\nproposition might excite the suspicion of the ditcher, yet self-interest\nwould prevent his communicating the suspicions. To be brief, the two\nwent behind a hedge, and presently Israel emerged, presenting the most\nforlorn appearance conceivable; while the old ditcher hobbled off in an\nopposite direction, correspondingly improved in his aspect; though it\nwas rather ludicrous than otherwise, owing to the immense bagginess of\nthe sailor-trowsers flapping about his lean shanks, to say nothing of\nthe spare voluminousness of the pea-jacket. But Israel--how deplorable,\nhow dismal his plight! Little did he ween that these wretched rags he\nnow wore, were but suitable to that long career of destitution before\nhim: one brief career of adventurous wanderings; and then, forty torpid\nyears of pauperism. The coat was all patches. And no two patches were\nalike, and no one patch was the color of the original cloth. The\nstringless breeches gaped wide open at the knee; the long woollen\nstockings looked as if they had been set up at some time for a target.\nIsrael looked suddenly metamorphosed from youth to old age; just like an\nold man of eighty he looked. But, indeed, dull, dreary adversity was now\nin store for him; and adversity, come it at eighteen or eighty, is the\ntrue old age of man. The dress befitted the fate.\n\nFrom the friendly old ditcher, Israel learned the exact course he must\nsteer for London; distant now between seventy and eighty miles. He was\nalso apprised by his venerable friend, that the country was filled with\nsoldiers on the constant look-out for deserters whether from the navy or\narmy, for the capture of whom a stipulated reward was given, just as in\nMassachusetts at that time for prowling bears.\n\nHaving solemnly enjoined his old friend not to give any information,\nshould any one he meet inquire for such a person as Israel, our\nadventurer walked briskly on, less heavy of heart, now that he felt\ncomparatively safe in disguise.\n\nThirty miles were travelled that day. At night Israel stole into a barn,\nin hopes of finding straw or hay for a bed. But it was spring; all the\nhay and straw were gone. So after groping about in the dark, he was fain\nto content himself with an undressed sheep-skin. Cold, hungry,\nfoot-sore, weary, and impatient for the morning dawn, Israel drearily\ndozed out the night.\n\nBy the first peep of day coming through the chinks of the barn, he was\nup and abroad. Ere long finding himself in the suburbs of a considerable\nvillage, the better to guard against detection he supplied himself with\na rude crutch, and feigning himself a cripple, hobbled straight through\nthe town, followed by a perverse-minded cur, which kept up a continual,\nspiteful, suspicious bark. Israel longed to have one good rap at him\nwith his crutch, but thought it would hardly look in character for a\npoor old cripple to be vindictive.\n\nA few miles further, and he came to a second village. While hobbling\nthrough its main street, as through the former one, he was suddenly\nstopped by a genuine cripple, all in tatters, too, who, with a\nsympathetic air, inquired after the cause of his lameness.\n\n\"White swelling,\" says Israel.\n\n\"That's just my ailing,\" wheezed the other; \"but you're lamer than me,\"\nhe added with a forlorn sort of self-satisfaction, critically eyeing\nIsrael's limp as once, more he stumped on his way, not liking to tarry\ntoo long.\n\n\"But halloo, what's your hurry, friend?\" seeing Israel fairly\ndeparting--\"where're you going?\"\n\n\"To London,\" answered Israel, turning round, heartily wishing the old\nfellow any where else than present.\n\n\"Going to limp to Lunnun, eh? Well, success to ye.\"\n\n\"As much to you, sir,\" answers Israel politely.\n\nNigh the opposite suburbs of this village, as good fortune would have\nit, an empty baggage-wagon bound for the metropolis turned into the main\nroad from a side one. Immediately Israel limps most deplorably, and begs\nthe driver to give a poor cripple a lift. So up he climbs; but after a\ntime, finding the gait of the elephantine draught-horses intolerably\nslow, Israel craves permission to dismount, when, throwing away his\ncrutch, he takes nimbly to his legs, much to the surprise of his honest\nfriend the driver.\n\nThe only advantage, if any, derived from his trip in the wagon, was,\nwhen passing through a third village--but a little distant from the\nprevious one--Israel, by lying down in the wagon, had wholly avoided\nbeing seen.\n\nThe villages surprised him by their number and proximity. Nothing like\nthis was to be seen at home. Well knowing that in these villages he ran\nmuch more risk of detection than in the open country, he henceforth did\nhis best to avoid them, by taking a roundabout course whenever they came\nin sight from a distance. This mode of travelling not only lengthened\nhis journey, but put unlooked-for obstacles in his path--walls, ditches,\nand streams.\n\nNot half an hour after throwing away his crutch, he leaped a great ditch\nten feet wide, and of undiscoverable muddy depth. I wonder if the old\ncripple would think me the lamer one now, thought Israel to himself,\narriving on the hither side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nFURTHER WANDERINGS OF THE REFUGEE, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF A GOOD KNIGHT OF\nBRENTFORD WHO BEFRIENDED HIM.\n\n\nAt nightfall, on the third day, Israel had arrived within sixteen miles\nof the capital. Once more he sought refuge in a barn. This time he found\nsome hay, and flinging himself down procured a tolerable night's rest.\n\nBright and early he arose refreshed, with the pleasing prospect of\nreaching his destination ere noon. Encouraged to find himself now so far\nfrom his original pursuers, Israel relaxed in his vigilance, and about\nten o'clock, while passing through the town of Staines, suddenly\nencountered three soldiers. Unfortunately in exchanging clothes with the\nditcher, he could not bring himself to include his shirt in the traffic,\nwhich shirt was a British navy shirt, a bargeman's shirt, and though\nhitherto he had crumpled the blue collar out of sight, yet, as it\nappeared in the present instance, it was not thoroughly concealed. At\nany rate, keenly on the look-out for deserters, and made acute by hopes\nof reward for their apprehension, the soldiers spied the fatal collar,\nand in an instant laid violent hands on the refugee.\n\n\"Hey, lad!\" said the foremost soldier, a corporal, \"you are one of his\nmajesty's seamen! come along with ye.\"\n\nSo, unable to give any satisfactory account of himself, he was made\nprisoner on the spot, and soon after found himself handcuffed and locked\nup in the Bound House of the place, a prison so called, appropriated to\nrunaways, and those convicted of minor offences. Day passed dinnerless\nand supperless in this dismal durance, and night came on.\n\nIsrael had now been three days without food, except one two-penny loaf.\nThe cravings of hunger now became sharper; his spirits, hitherto arming\nhim with fortitude, began to forsake him. Taken captive once again upon\nthe very brink of reaching his goal, poor Israel was on the eve of\nfalling into helpless despair. But he rallied, and considering that\ngrief would only add to his calamity, sought with stubborn patience to\nhabituate himself to misery, but still hold aloof from despondency. He\nroused himself, and began to bethink him how to be extricated from this\nlabyrinth.\n\nTwo hours sawing across the grating of the window, ridded him of his\nhandcuffs. Next came the door, secured luckily with only a hasp and\npadlock. Thrusting the bolt of his handcuffs through a small window in\nthe door, he succeeded in forcing the hasp and regaining his liberty\nabout three o'clock in the morning.\n\nNot long after sunrise, he passed nigh Brentford, some six or seven\nmiles from the capital. So great was his hunger that downright\nstarvation seemed before him. He chewed grass, and swallowed it. Upon\nfirst escaping from the hulk, six English pennies was all the money he\nhad. With two of these he had bought a small loaf the day after fleeing\nthe inn. The other four still remained in his pocket, not having met\nwith a good opportunity to dispose of them for food.\n\nHaving torn off the collar of his shirt, and flung it into a hedge, he\nventured to accost a respectable carpenter at a pale fence, about a mile\nthis side of Brentford, to whom his deplorable situation now induced him\nto apply for work. The man did not wish himself to hire, but said that\nif he (Israel) understood farming or gardening, he might perhaps procure\nwork from Sir John Millet, whose seat, he said, was not remote. He added\nthat the knight was in the habit of employing many men at that season of\nthe year, so he stood a fair chance.\n\nRevived a little by this prospect of relief, Israel starts in quest of\nthe gentleman's seat, agreeably to the direction received. But he\nmistook his way, and proceeding up a gravelled and beautifully decorated\nwalk, was terrified at catching a glimpse of a number of soldiers\nthronging a garden. He made an instant retreat before being espied in\nturn. No wild creature of the American wilderness could have been more\npanic-struck by a firebrand, than at this period hunted Israel was by a\nred coat. It afterwards appeared that this garden was the Princess\nAmelia's.\n\nTaking another path, ere long he came to some laborers shovelling\ngravel. These proved to be men employed by Sir John. By them he was\ndirected towards the house, when the knight was pointed out to him,\nwalking bare-headed in the inclosure with several guests. Having heard\nthe rich men of England charged with all sorts of domineering qualities,\nIsrael felt no little misgiving in approaching to an audience with so\nimposing a stranger. But, screwing up his courage, he advanced; while\nseeing him coming all rags and tatters, the group of gentlemen stood in\nsome wonder awaiting what so singular a phantom might want.\n\n\"Mr. Millet,\" said Israel, bowing towards the bare-headed gentleman.\n\n\"Ha,--who are you, pray?\"\n\n\"A poor fellow, sir, in want of work.\"\n\n\"A wardrobe, too, I should say,\" smiled one of the guests, of a very\nyouthful, prosperous, and dandified air.\n\n\"Where's your hoe?\" said Sir John.\n\n\"I have none, sir.\"\n\n\"Any money to buy one?\"\n\n\"Only four English pennies, sir.\"\n\n\"_English_ pennies. What other sort would you have?\"\n\n\"Why, China pennies to be sure,\" laughed the youthful gentleman. \"See\nhis long, yellow hair behind; he looks like a Chinaman. Some broken-down\nMandarin. Pity he's no crown to his old hat; if he had, he might pass it\nround, and make eight pennies of his four.\"\n\n\"Will you hire me, Mr. Millet,\" said Israel.\n\n\"Ha! that's queer again,\" cried the knight.\n\n\"Hark ye, fellow,\" said a brisk servant, approaching from the porch,\n\"this is Sir John Millet.\"\n\nSeeming to take pity on his seeming ignorance, as well as on his\nundisputable poverty, the good knight now told Israel that if he would\ncome the next morning he would see him supplied with a hoe, and moreover\nwould hire him.\n\nIt would be hard to express the satisfaction of the wanderer at\nreceiving this encouraging reply. Emboldened by it, he now returns\ntowards a baker's he had spied, and bravely marching in, flings down all\nfour pennies, and demands bread. Thinking he would not have any more\nfood till next morning, Israel resolved to eat only one of the pair of\ntwo-penny loaves. But having demolished one, it so sharpened his longing,\nthat yielding to the irresistible temptation, he bolted down the second\nloaf to keep the other company.\n\nAfter resting under a hedge, he saw the sun far descended, and so\nprepared himself for another hard night. Waiting till dark, he crawled\ninto an old carriage-house, finding nothing there but a dismantled old\nphaeton. Into this he climbed, and curling himself up like a\ncarriage-dog, endeavored to sleep; but, unable to endure the constraint\nof such a bed, got out, and stretched himself on the bare boards of the\nfloor.\n\nNo sooner was light in the east than he fastened to await the commands\nof one who, his instinct told him, was destined to prove his benefactor.\nOn his father's farm accustomed to rise with the lark, Israel was\nsurprised to discover, as he approached the house, that no soul was\nastir. It was four o'clock. For a considerable time he walked back and\nforth before the portal ere any one appeared. The first riser was a man\nservant of the household, who informed Israel that seven o'clock was the\nhour the people went to their work. Soon after he met an hostler of the\nplace, who gave him permission to lie on some straw in an outhouse.\nThere he enjoyed a sweet sleep till awakened at seven o'clock by the\nsounds of activity around him.\n\nSupplied by the overseer of the men with a large iron fork and a hoe,\nhe followed the hands into the field. He was so weak he could hardly\nsupport his tools. Unwilling to expose his debility, he yet could not\nsucceed in concealing it. At last, to avoid worse imputations, he\nconfessed the cause. His companions regarded him with compassion, and\nexempted him from the severer toil.\n\nAbout noon the knight visited his workmen. Noticing that Israel made\nlittle progress, he said to him, that though he had long arms and broad\nshoulders, yet he was feigning himself to be a very weak man, or\notherwise must in reality be so.\n\nHereupon one of the laborers standing by informed the gentleman how it\nwas with Israel, when immediately the knight put a shilling into his\nhands and bade him go to a little roadside inn, which was nearer than\nthe house, and buy him bread and a pot of beer. Thus refreshed he\nreturned to the band, and toiled with them till four o'clock, when the\nday's work was over.\n\nArrived at the house he there again saw his employer, who, after\nattentively eyeing him without speaking, bade a meal be prepared for\nhim, when the maid presenting a smaller supply than her kind master\ndeemed necessary, she was ordered to return and bring out the entire\ndish. But aware of the danger of sudden repletion of heavy food to one\nin his condition, Israel, previously recruited by the frugal meal at the\ninn, partook but sparingly. The repast was spread on the grass, and\nbeing over, the good knight again looking inquisitively at Israel,\nordered a comfortable bed to be laid in the barn, and here Israel spent\na capital night.\n\nAfter breakfast, next morning, he was proceeding to go with the laborers\nto their work, when his employer approaching him with a benevolent air,\nbade him return to his couch, and there remain till he had slept his\nfill, and was in a better state to resume his labors.\n\nUpon coming forth again a little after noon, he found Sir John walking\nalone in the grounds. Upon discovering him, Israel would have retreated,\nfearing that he might intrude; but beckoning him to advance, the knight,\nas Israel drew nigh, fixed on him such a penetrating glance, that our\npoor hero quaked to the core. Neither was his dread of detection\nrelieved by the knight's now calling in a loud voice for one from the\nhouse. Israel was just on the point of fleeing, when overhearing the\nwords of the master to the servant who now appeared, all dread departed:\n\n\"Bring hither some wine!\"\n\nIt presently came; by order of the knight the salver was set down on a\ngreen bank near by, and the servant retired.\n\n\"My poor fellow,\" said Sir John, now pouring out a glass of wine, and\nhanding it to Israel, \"I perceive that you are an American; and, if I\nam not mistaken, you are an escaped prisoner of war. But no fear--drink\nthe wine.\"\n\n\"Mr. Millet,\" exclaimed Israel aghast, the untasted wine trembling in\nhis hand, \"Mr. Millet, I--\"\n\n\"_Mr_. Millet--there it is again. Why don't you say _Sir John_ like the\nrest?\"\n\n\"Why, sir--pardon me--but somehow, I can't. I've tried; but I can't. You\nwon't betray me for that?\"\n\n\"Betray--poor fellow! Hark ye, your history is doubtless a secret which\nyou would not wish to divulge to a stranger; but whatever happens to\nyou, I pledge you my honor I will never betray you.\"\n\n\"God bless you for that, Mr. Millet.\"\n\n\"Come, come; call me by my right name. I am not Mr. Millet. _You_ have\nsaid _Sir_ to me; and no doubt you have a thousand times said _John_ to\nother people. Now can't you couple the two? Try once. Come. Only _Sir_\nand then _John_--_Sir John_--that's all.\"\n\n\"John--I can't--Sir, sir!--your pardon. I didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"My good fellow,\" said the knight looking sharply upon Israel, \"tell me,\nare all your countrymen like you? If so, it's no use fighting them. To\nthat effect, I must write to his Majesty myself. Well, I excuse you from\nSir Johnning me. But tell me the truth, are you not a seafaring man, and\nlately a prisoner of war?\"\n\nIsrael frankly confessed it, and told his whole story. The knight\nlistened with much interest; and at its conclusion, warned Israel to\nbeware of the soldiers; for owing to the seats of some of the royal\nfamily being in the neighborhood, the red-coats abounded hereabout.\n\n\"I do not wish unnecessarily to speak against my own countrymen,\" he\nadded, \"I but plainly speak for your good. The soldiers you meet\nprowling on the roads, are not fair specimens of the army. They are a\nset of mean, dastardly banditti, who, to obtain their fee, would betray\ntheir best friends. Once more, I warn you against them. But enough;\nfollow me now to the house, and as you tell me you have exchanged\nclothes before now, you can do it again. What say you? I will give you\ncoat and breeches for your rags.\"\n\nThus generously supplied with clothes and other comforts by the good\nknight, and implicitly relying upon the honor of so kind-hearted a man,\nIsrael cheered up, and in the course of two or three weeks had so\nfattened his flanks, that he was able completely to fill Sir John's old\nbuckskin breeches, which at first had hung but loosely about him.\n\nHe was assigned to an occupation which removed him from the other\nworkmen. The strawberry bed was put under his sole charge. And often, of\nmild, sunny afternoons, the knight, genial and gentle with dinner, would\nstroll bare-headed to the pleasant strawberry bed, and have nice little\nconfidential chats with Israel; while Israel, charmed by the patriarchal\ndemeanor of this true Abrahamic gentleman, with a smile on his lip, and\ntears of gratitude in his eyes, offered him, from time to time, the\nplumpest berries of the bed.\n\nWhen the strawberry season was over, other parts of the grounds were\nassigned him. And so six months elapsed, when, at the recommendation of\nSir John, Israel procured a good berth in the garden of the Princess\nAmelia.\n\nSo completely now had recent events metamorphosed him in all outward\nthings, that few suspected him of being any other than an Englishman.\nNot even the knight's domestics. But in the princess's garden, being\nobliged to work in company with many other laborers, the war was often\na topic of discussion among them. And \"the d--d Yankee rebels\" were not\nseldom the object of scurrilous remark. Illy could the exile brook in\nsilence such insults upon the country for which he had bled, and for\nwhose honored sake he was that very instant a sufferer. More than once,\nhis indignation came very nigh getting the better of his prudence. He\nlonged for the war to end, that he might but speak a little bit of his\nmind.\n\nNow the superintendent of the garden was a harsh, overbearing man. The\nworkmen with tame servility endured his worst affronts. But Israel, bred\namong mountains, found it impossible to restrain himself when made the\nundeserved object of pitiless epithets. Ere two months went by, he\nquitted the service of the princess, and engaged himself to a farmer in\na small village not far from Brentford. But hardly had he been here\nthree weeks, when a rumor again got afloat that he was a Yankee prisoner\nof war. Whence this report arose he could never discover. No sooner did\nit reach the ears of the soldiers, than they were on the alert. Luckily,\nIsrael was apprised of their intentions in time. But he was hard pushed.\nHe was hunted after with a perseverance worthy a less ignoble cause. He\nhad many hairbreadth escapes. Most assuredly he would have been\ncaptured, had it not been for the secret good offices of a few\nindividuals, who, perhaps, were not unfriendly to the American side of\nthe question, though they durst not avow it.\n\nTracked one night by the soldiers to the house of one of these friends,\nin whose garret he was concealed, he was obliged to force the skuttle,\nand running along the roof, passed to those of adjoining houses to the\nnumber of ten or twelve, finally succeeding in making his escape.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nISRAEL IN THE LION'S DEN.\n\n\nHarassed day and night, hunted from food and sleep, driven from hole to\nhole like a fox in the woods, with no chance to earn an hour's wages, he\nwas at last advised by one whose sincerity he could not doubt, to apply,\non the good word of Sir John Millet, for a berth as laborer in the\nKing's Gardens at Kew. There, it was said, he would be entirely safe, as\nno soldier durst approach those premises to molest any soul therein\nemployed. It struck the poor exile as curious, that the very den of the\nBritish lion, the private grounds of the British King, should be\ncommended to a refugee as his securest asylum.\n\nHis nativity carefully concealed, and being personally introduced to the\nchief gardener by one who well knew him; armed, too, with a line from\nSir John, and recommended by his introducer as uncommonly expert at\nhorticulture; Israel was soon installed as keeper of certain less\nprivate plants and walks of the park.\n\nIt was here, to one of his near country retreats, that, coming from\nperplexities of state--leaving far behind him the dingy old bricks of\nSt. James--George the Third was wont to walk up and down beneath the\nlong arbors formed by the interlockings of lofty trees.\n\nMore than once, raking the gravel, Israel through intervening foliage\nwould catch peeps in some private but parallel walk, of that lonely\nfigure, not more shadowy with overhanging leaves than with the shade of\nroyal meditations.\n\nUnauthorized and abhorrent thoughts will sometimes invade the best human\nheart. Seeing the monarch unguarded before him; remembering that the war\nwas imputed more to the self-will of the King than to the willingness of\nparliament or the nation; and calling to mind all his own sufferings\ngrowing out of that war, with all the calamities of his country; dim\nimpulses, such as those to which the regicide Ravaillae yielded, would\nshoot balefully across the soul of the exile. But thrusting Satan behind\nhim, Israel vanquished all such temptations. Nor did these ever more\ndisturb him, after his one chance conversation with the monarch.\n\nAs he was one day gravelling a little by-walk, wrapped in thought, the\nKing turning a clump of bushes, suddenly brushed Israel's person.\n\nImmediately Israel touched his hat--but did not remove it--bowed, and\nwas retiring; when something in his air arrested the King's attention.\n\n\"You ain't an Englishman,--no Englishman--no, no.\"\n\nPale as death, Israel tried to answer something; but knowing not what to\nsay, stood frozen to the ground.\n\n\"You are a Yankee--a Yankee,\" said the King again in his rapid and\nhalf-stammering way.\n\nAgain Israel assayed to reply, but could not. What could he say? Could\nhe lie to a King?\n\n\"Yes, yes,--you are one of that stubborn race,--that very stubborn race.\nWhat brought you here?\"\n\n\"The fate of war, sir.\"\n\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said a low cringing voice, approaching,\n\"this man is in the walk against orders. There is some mistake, may it\nplease your Majesty. Quit the walk, blockhead,\" he hissed at Israel.\n\nIt was one of the junior gardeners who thus spoke. It seems that Israel\nhad mistaken his directions that morning.\n\n\"Slink, you dog,\" hissed the gardener again to Israel; then aloud to the\nKing, \"A mistake of the man, I assure your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Go you away--away with ye, and leave him with me,\" said the king.\n\nWaiting a moment, till the man was out of hearing, the king again turned\nupon Israel.\n\n\"Were you at Bunker Hill?--that bloody Bunker Hill--eh, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Fought like a devil--like a very devil, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Helped flog--helped flog my soldiers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; but very sorry to do it.\"\n\n\"Eh?--eh?--how's that?\"\n\n\"I took it to be my sad duty, sir.\"\n\n\"Very much mistaken--very much mistaken, indeed. Why do ye sir me?--eh?\nI'm your king--your king.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Israel firmly, but with deep respect, \"I have no king.\"\n\nThe king darted his eye incensedly for a moment; but without quailing,\nIsrael, now that all was out, still stood with mute respect before him.\nThe king, turning suddenly, walked rapidly away from Israel a moment,\nbut presently returning with a less hasty pace, said, \"You are rumored\nto be a spy--a spy, or something of that sort--ain't you? But I know you\nare not--no, no. You are a runaway prisoner of war, eh? You have sought\nthis place to be safe from pursuit, eh? eh? Is it not so?--eh? eh? eh?\"\n\n\"Sir, it is.\"\n\n\"Well, ye're an honest rebel--rebel, yes, rebel. Hark ye, hark. Say\nnothing of this talk to any one. And hark again. So long as you remain\nhere at Kew, I shall see that you are safe--safe.\"\n\n\"God bless your Majesty!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"God bless your noble Majesty?\"\n\n\"Come--come--come,\" smiled the king in delight, \"I thought I could\nconquer ye--conquer ye.\"\n\n\"Not the king, but the king's kindness, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Join my army--army.\"\n\nSadly looking down, Israel silently shook his head.\n\n\"You won't? Well, gravel the walk then--gravel away. Very stubborn\nrace--very stubborn race, indeed--very--very--very.\"\n\nAnd still growling, the magnanimous lion departed. How the monarch came\nby his knowledge of so humble an exile, whether through that swift\ninsight into individual character said to form one of the miraculous\nqualities transmitted with a crown, or whether some of the rumors\nprevailing outside of the garden had come to his ear, Israel could never\ndetermine. Very probably, though, the latter was the case, inasmuch as\nsome vague shadowy report of Israel not being an Englishman, had, a\nlittle previous to his interview with the king, been communicated to\nseveral of the inferior gardeners. Without any impeachment of Israel's\nfealty to his country, it must still be narrated, that from this his\nfamiliar audience with George the Third, he went away with very\nfavorable views of that monarch. Israel now thought that it could not be\nthe warm heart of the king, but the cold heads of his lords in council,\nthat persuaded him so tyrannically to persecute America. Yet hitherto\nthe precise contrary of this had been Israel's opinion, agreeably to the\npopular prejudice throughout New England.\n\nThus we see what strange and powerful magic resides in a crown, and how\nsubtly that cheap and easy magnanimity, which in private belongs to most\nkings, may operate on good-natured and unfortunate souls. Indeed, had it\nnot been for the peculiar disinterested fidelity of our adventurer's\npatriotism, he would have soon sported the red coat; and perhaps under\nthe immediate patronage of his royal friend, been advanced in time to no\nmean rank in the army of Britain. Nor in that case would we have had to\nfollow him, as at last we shall, through long, long years of obscure and\npenurious wandering.\n\nContinuing in the service of the king's gardeners at Kew, until a\nseason came when the work of the garden required a less number of\nlaborers, Israel, with several others, was discharged; and the day\nafter, engaged himself for a few months to a farmer in the neighborhood\nwhere he had been last employed. But hardly a week had gone by, when the\nold story of his being a rebel, or a runaway prisoner, or a Yankee, or a\nspy, began to be revived with added malignity. Like bloodhounds, the\nsoldiers were once more on the track. The houses where he harbored were\nmany times searched; but thanks to the fidelity of a few earnest\nwell-wishers, and to his own unsleeping vigilance and activity, the\nhunted fox still continued to elude apprehension. To such extremities of\nharassment, however, did this incessant pursuit subject him, that in a\nfit of despair he was about to surrender himself, and submit to his\nfate, when Providence seasonably interposed in his favor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nISRAEL MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF CERTAIN SECRET FRIENDS OF AMERICA, ONE\nOF THEM BEING THE FAMOUS AUTHOR OF THE \"DIVERSIONS OF PURLEY,\" THESE\nDESPATCH HIM ON A SLY ERRAND ACROSS THE CHANNEL.\n\n\nAt this period, though made the victims indeed of British oppression,\nyet the colonies were not totally without friends in Britain. It was but\nnatural that when Parliament itself held patriotic and gifted men, who\nnot only recommended conciliatory measures, but likewise denounced the\nwar as monstrous; it was but natural that throughout the nation at large\nthere should be many private individuals cherishing similar sentiments,\nand some who made no scruple clandestinely to act upon them.\n\nLate one night while hiding in a farmer's granary, Israel saw a man with\na lantern approaching. He was about to flee, when the man hailed him in\na well-known voice, bidding him have no fear. It was the farmer himself.\nHe carried a message to Israel from a gentleman of Brentford, to the\neffect, that the refugee was earnestly requested to repair on the\nfollowing evening to that gentleman's mansion.\n\nAt first, Israel was disposed to surmise that either the farmer was\nplaying him false, or else his honest credulity had been imposed upon by\nevil-minded persons. At any rate, he regarded the message as a decoy,\nand for half an hour refused to credit its sincerity. But at length he\nwas induced to think a little better of it. The gentleman giving the\ninvitation was one Squire Woodcock, of Brentford, whose loyalty to the\nking had been under suspicion; so at least the farmer averred. This\nlatter information was not without its effect.\n\nAt nightfall on the following day, being disguised in strange clothes by\nthe farmer, Israel stole from his retreat, and after a few hours' walk,\narrived before the ancient brick house of the Squire; who opening the\ndoor in person, and learning who it was that stood there, at once\nassured Israel in the most solemn manner, that no foul play was\nintended. So the wanderer suffered himself to enter, and be conducted\nto a private chamber in the rear of the mansion, where were seated two\nother gentlemen, attired, in the manner of that age, in long laced\ncoats, with small-clothes, and shoes with silver buckles.\n\n\"I am John Woodcock,\" said the host, \"and these gentlemen are Horne\nTooke and James Bridges. All three of us are friends to America. We have\nheard of you for some weeks past, and inferring from your conduct, that\nyou must be a Yankee of the true blue stamp, we have resolved to employ\nyou in a way which you cannot but gladly approve; for surely, though an\nexile, you are still willing to serve your country; if not as a sailor\nor soldier, yet as a traveller?\"\n\n\"Tell me how I may do it?\" demanded Israel, not completely at ease.\n\n\"At that in good time,\" smiled the Squire. \"The point is now--do you\nrepose confidence in my statements?\"\n\nIsrael glanced inquiringly upon the Squire; then upon his companions;\nand meeting the expressive, enthusiastic, candid countenance of Horne\nTooke--then in the first honest ardor of his political career--turned\nto the Squire, and said, \"Sir, I believe what you have said. Tell me now\nwhat I am to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is just nothing to be done to-night,\" said the Squire; \"nor\nfor some days to come perhaps, but we wanted to have you prepared.\"\n\nAnd hereupon he hinted to his guest rather vaguely of his general\nintention; and that over, begged him to entertain them with some account\nof his adventures since he first took up arms for his country. To this\nIsrael had no objections in the world, since all men love to tell the\ntale of hardships endured in a righteous cause. But ere beginning his\nstory, the Squire refreshed him with some cold beef, laid in a snowy\nnapkin, and a glass of Perry, and thrice during the narration of the\nadventures, pressed him with additional draughts.\n\nBut after his second glass, Israel declined to drink more, mild as the\nbeverage was. For he noticed, that not only did the three gentlemen\nlisten with the utmost interest to his story, but likewise\ninterrupted him with questions and cross-questions in the most\npertinacious manner. So this led him to be on his guard, not being\nabsolutely certain yet, as to who they might really be, or what was\ntheir real design. But as it turned out, Squire Woodcock and his friends\nonly sought to satisfy themselves thoroughly, before making their final\ndisclosures, that the exile was one in whom implicit confidence might be\nplaced.\n\nAnd to this desirable conclusion they eventually came, for upon the\nending of Israel's story, after expressing their sympathies for his\nhardships, and applauding his generous patriotism in so patiently\nenduring adversity, as well as singing the praises of his gallant\nfellow-soldiers of Bunker Hill, they openly revealed their scheme. They\nwished to know whether Israel would undertake a trip to Paris, to carry\nan important message--shortly to be received for transmission through\nthem--to Doctor Franklin, then in that capital.\n\n\"All your expenses shall be paid, not to speak of a compensation\nbesides,\" said the Squire; \"will you go?\"\n\n\"I must think of it,\" said Israel, not yet wholly confirmed in his mind.\nBut once more he cast his glance on Horne Tooke, and his irresolution\nwas gone.\n\nThe Squire now informed Israel that, to avoid suspicions, it would be\nnecessary for him to remove to another place until the hour at which he\nshould start for Paris. They enjoined upon him the profoundest secresy,\ngave him a guinea, with a letter for a gentleman in White Waltham, a\ntown some miles from Brentford, which point they begged him to reach\nas soon as possible, there to tarry for further instructions.\n\nHaving informed him of thus much, Squire Woodcock asked him to hold out\nhis right foot.\n\n\"What for?\" said Israel.\n\n\"Why, would you not like to have a pair of new boots against your\nreturn?\" smiled Home Tooke.\n\n\"Oh, yes; no objection at all,\" said, Israel.\n\n\"Well, then, let the bootmaker measure you,\" smiled Horne Tooke.\n\n\"Do _you_ do it, Mr. Tooke,\" said the Squire; \"you measure men's parts\nbetter than I.\"\n\n\"Hold out your foot, my good friend,\" said Horne Tooke--\"there--now\nlet's measure your heart.\"\n\n\"For that, measure me round the chest,\" said Israel.\n\n\"Just the man we want,\" said Mr. Bridges, triumphantly.\n\n\"Give him another glass of wine, Squire,\" said Horne Tooke.\n\nExchanging the farmer's clothes for still another disguise, Israel now\nset out immediately, on foot, for his destination, having received\nminute directions as to his road, and arriving in White Waltham on the\nfollowing morning was very cordially received by the gentleman to whom\nhe carried the letter. This person, another of the active English\nfriends of America, possessed a particular knowledge of late events in\nthat land. To him Israel was indebted for much entertaining information.\nAfter remaining some ten days at this place, word came from Squire\nWoodcock, requiring Israel's immediate return, stating the hour at which\nhe must arrive at the house, namely, two o'clock on the following\nmorning. So, after another night's solitary trudge across the country,\nthe wanderer was welcomed by the same three gentlemen as before, seated\nin the same room.\n\n\"The time has now come,\" said Squire Woodcock. \"You must start this\nmorning for Paris. Take off your shoes.\"\n\n\"Am I to steal from here to Paris on my stocking-feet?\" said Israel,\nwhose late easy good living at White Waltham had not failed to bring out\nthe good-natured and mirthful part of him, even as his prior experiences\nhad produced, for the most part, something like a contrary result.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" smiled Horne Tooke, who always lived well, \"we have\nseven-league-boots for you. Don't you remember my measuring you?\"\n\nHereupon going to the closet, the Squire brought out a pair of new\nboots. They were fitted with false heels. Unscrewing these, the Squire\nshowed Israel the papers concealed beneath. They were of a fine tissuey\nfibre, and contained much writing in a very small compass. The boots, it\nneed hardly be said, had been particularly made for the occasion.\n\n\"Walk across the room with them,\" said the Squire, when Israel had\npulled them on.\n\n\"He'll surely be discovered,\" smiled Horne Tooke. \"Hark how he creaks.\"\n\n\"Come, come, it's too serious a matter for joking,\" said the Squire.\n\"Now, my fine fellow, be cautious, be sober, be vigilant, and above all\nthings be speedy.\"\n\nBeing furnished now with all requisite directions, and a supply of\nmoney, Israel, taking leave of Mr. Tooke and Mr. Bridges, was secretly\nconducted down stairs by the Squire, and in five minutes' time was on\nhis way to Charing Cross in London, where taking the post-coach for\nDover, he thence went in a packet to Calais, and in fifteen minutes\nafter landing, was being wheeled over French soil towards Paris. He\narrived there in safety, and freely declaring himself an American, the\npeculiarly friendly relations of the two nations at that period,\nprocured him kindly attentions even from strangers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nAFTER A CURIOUS ADVENTURE UPON THE PONT NEUF, ISRAEL ENTERS THE PRESENCE\nOF THE RENOWNED SAGE, DR. FRANKLIN, WHOM HE FINDS RIGHT LEARNEDLY AND\nMULTIFARIOUSLY EMPLOYED.\n\n\nFollowing the directions given him at the place where the diligence\nstopped, Israel was crossing the Pont Neuf, to find Doctor Franklin,\nwhen he was suddenly called to by a man standing on one side of the\nbridge, just under the equestrian statue of Henry IV.\n\nThe man had a small, shabby-looking box before him on the ground, with\na box of blacking on one side of it, and several shoe-brushes upon the\nother. Holding another brush in his hand, he politely seconded his\nverbal invitation by gracefully flourishing the brush in the air.\n\n\"What do you want of me, neighbor?\" said Israel, pausing in somewhat\nuneasy astonishment.\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur,\" exclaimed the man, and with voluble politeness he ran\non with a long string of French, which of course was all Greek to poor\nIsrael. But what his language failed to convey, his gestures now made\nvery plain. Pointing to the wet muddy state of the bridge, splashed by\na recent rain, and then to the feet of the wayfarer, and lastly to the\nbrush in his hand, he appeared to be deeply regretting that a gentleman\nof Israel's otherwise imposing appearance should be seen abroad with\nunpolished boots, offering at the same time to remove their blemishes.\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur, Monsieur,\" cried the man, at last running up to Israel.\nAnd with tender violence he forced him towards the box, and lifting this\nunwilling customer's right foot thereon, was proceeding vigorously to\nwork, when suddenly illuminated by a dreadful suspicion, Israel,\nfetching the box a terrible kick, took to his false heels and ran like\nmad over the bridge.\n\nIncensed that his politeness should receive such an ungracious return,\nthe man pursued, which but confirming Israel in his suspicions he ran\nall the faster, and thanks to his fleetness, soon succeeded in escaping\nhis pursuer.\n\nArrived at last at the street and the house to which he had been\ndirected, in reply to his summons, the gate very strangely of itself\nswung open, and much astonished at this unlooked-for sort of\nenchantment, Israel entered a wide vaulted passage leading to an open\ncourt within. While he was wondering that no soul appeared, suddenly he\nwas hailed from a dark little window, where sat an old man cobbling\nshoes, while an old woman standing by his side was thrusting her head\ninto the passage, intently eyeing the stranger. They proved to be the\nporter and portress, the latter of whom, upon hearing his summons, had\ninvisibly thrust open the gate to Israel, by means of a spring\ncommunicating with the little apartment.\n\nUpon hearing the name of Doctor Franklin mentioned, the old woman, all\nalacrity, hurried out of her den, and with much courtesy showed Israel\nacross the court, up three flights of stairs to a door in the rear of\nthe spacious building. There she left him while Israel knocked.\n\n\"Come in,\" said a voice.\n\nAnd immediately Israel stood in the presence of the venerable Doctor\nFranklin.\n\nWrapped in a rich dressing-gown, a fanciful present from an admiring\nMarchesa, curiously embroidered with algebraic figures like a conjuror's\nrobe, and with a skull-cap of black satin on his hive of a head, the man\nof gravity was seated at a huge claw-footed old table, round as the\nzodiac. It was covered with printer papers, files of documents, rolls of\nmanuscript, stray bits of strange models in wood and metal, odd-looking\npamphlets in various languages, and all sorts of books, including many\npresentation-copies, embracing history, mechanics, diplomacy,\nagriculture, political economy, metaphysics, meteorology, and geometry.\nThe walls had a necromantic look, hung round with barometers of\ndifferent kinds, drawings of surprising inventions, wide maps of far\ncountries in the New World, containing vast empty spaces in the middle,\nwith the word DESERT diffusely printed there, so as to span\nfive-and-twenty degrees of longitude with only two syllables,--which\nprinted word, however, bore a vigorous pen-mark, in the Doctor's hand,\ndrawn straight through it, as if in summary repeal of it; crowded\ntopographical and trigonometrical charts of various parts of Europe;\nwith geometrical diagrams, and endless other surprising hangings and\nupholstery of science.\n\nThe chamber itself bore evident marks of antiquity. One part of the\nrough-finished wall was sadly cracked, and covered with dust, looked dim\nand dark. But the aged inmate, though wrinkled as well, looked neat and\nhale. Both wall and sage were compounded of like materials,--lime and\ndust; both, too, were old; but while the rude earth of the wall had no\npainted lustre to shed off all fadings and tarnish, and still keep fresh\nwithout, though with long eld its core decayed: the living lime and dust\nof the sage was frescoed with defensive bloom of his soul.\n\nThe weather was warm; like some old West India hogshead on the wharf,\nthe whole chamber buzzed with flies. But the sapient inmate sat still\nand cool in the midst. Absorbed in some other world of his occupations\nand thoughts, these insects, like daily cark and care, did not seem one\nwhit to annoy him. It was a goodly sight to see this serene, cool and\nripe old philosopher, who by sharp inquisition of man in the street, and\nthen long meditating upon him, surrounded by all those queer old\nimplements, charts and books, had grown at last so wondrous wise. There\nhe sat, quite motionless among those restless flies; and, with a sound\nlike the low noon murmur of foliage in the woods, turning over the\nleaves of some ancient and tattered folio, with a binding dark and\nshaggy as the bark of any old oak. It seemed as if supernatural lore\nmust needs pertain to this gravely, ruddy personage; at least far\nforesight, pleasant wit, and working wisdom. Old age seemed in no wise\nto have dulled him, but to have sharpened; just as old dinner-knives--so\nthey be of good steel--wax keen, spear-pointed, and elastic as\nwhale-bone with long usage. Yet though he was thus lively and vigorous\nto behold, spite of his seventy-two years (his exact date at that time)\nsomehow, the incredible seniority of an antediluvian seemed his. Not the\nyears of the calendar wholly, but also the years of sapience. His white\nhairs and mild brow, spoke of the future as well as the past. He seemed\nto be seven score years old; that is, three score and ten of prescience\nadded to three score and ten of remembrance, makes just seven score\nyears in all.\n\nBut when Israel stepped within the chamber, he lost the complete effect\nof all this; for the sage's back, not his face, was turned to him.\n\nSo, intent on his errand, hurried and heated with his recent run, our\ncourier entered the room, inadequately impressed, for the time, by\neither it or its occupant.\n\n\"Bon jour, bon jour, monsieur,\" said the man of wisdom, in a cheerful\nvoice, but too busy to turn round just then.\n\n\"How do you do, Doctor Franklin?\" said Israel.\n\n\"Ah! I smell Indian corn,\" said the Doctor, turning round quickly on his\nchair. \"A countryman; sit down, my good sir. Well, what news? Special?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, sir,\" said Israel, stepping across the room towards a\nchair.\n\nNow there was no carpet on the floor, which was of dark-colored wood,\nset in lozenges, and slippery with wax, after the usual French style.\nAs Israel walked this slippery floor, his unaccustomed feet slid about\nvery strangely as if walking on ice, so that he came very near falling.\n\n\"'Pears to me you have rather high heels to your boots,\" said the grave\nman of utility, looking sharply down through his spectacles; \"don't you\nknow that it's both wasting leather and endangering your limbs, to wear\nsuch high heels? I have thought, at my first leisure, to write a little\npamphlet against that very abuse. But pray, what are you doing now? Do\nyour boots pinch you, my friend, that you lift one foot from the floor\nthat way?\"\n\nAt this moment, Israel having seated himself, was just putting his right\nfoot across his left knee.\n\n\"How foolish,\" continued the wise man, \"for a rational creature to wear\ntight boots. Had nature intended rational creatures should do so, she\nwould have made the foot of solid bone, or perhaps of solid iron,\ninstead of bone, muscle, and flesh,--But,--I see. Hold!\"\n\nAnd springing to his own slippered feet, the venerable sage hurried to\nthe door and shot-to the bolt. Then drawing the curtain carefully across\nthe window looking out across the court to various windows on the\nopposite side, bade Israel proceed with his operations.\n\n\"I was mistaken this time,\" added the Doctor, smiling, as Israel\nproduced his documents from their curious recesses--\"your high heels,\ninstead of being idle vanities, seem to be full of meaning.\"\n\n\"Pretty full, Doctor,\" said Israel, now handing over the papers. \"I had\na narrow escape with them just now.\"\n\n\"How? How's that?\" said the sage, fumbling the papers eagerly.\n\n\"Why, crossing the stone bridge there over the _Seen_\"--\n\n\"_Seine_\"--interrupted the Doctor, giving the French\npronunciation.--\"Always get a new word right in the first place,\nmy friend, and you will never get it wrong afterwards.\"\n\n\"Well, I was crossing the bridge there, and who should hail me, but\na suspicious-looking man, who, under pretence of seeking to polish my\nboots, wanted slyly to unscrew their heels, and so steal all these\nprecious papers I've brought you.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" said the man of gravity, glancing scrutinizingly upon\nhis guest, \"have you not in your time, undergone what they call hard\ntimes? Been set upon, and persecuted, and very illy entreated by some of\nyour fellow-creatures?\"\n\n\"That I have, Doctor; yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"I thought so. Sad usage has made you sadly suspicious, my honest\nfriend. An indiscriminate distrust of human nature is the worst\nconsequence of a miserable condition, whether brought about by innocence\nor guilt. And though want of suspicion more than want of sense,\nsometimes leads a man into harm, yet too much suspicion is as bad as too\nlittle sense. The man you met, my friend, most probably had no artful\nintention; he knew just nothing about you or your heels; he simply\nwanted to earn two sous by brushing your boots. Those blacking-men\nregularly station themselves on the bridge.\"\n\n\"How sorry I am then that I knocked over his box, and then ran away.\nBut he didn't catch me.\"\n\n\"How? surely, my honest friend, you--appointed to the conveyance of\nimportant secret dispatches--did not act so imprudently as to kick over\nan innocent man's box in the public streets of the capital, to which you\nhad been especially sent?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Never act so unwisely again. If the police had got hold of you, think\nof what might have ensued.\"\n\n\"Well, it was not very wise of me, that's a fact, Doctor. But, you see,\nI thought he meant mischief.\"\n\n\"And because you only thought he _meant_ mischief, _you_ must\nstraightway proceed to _do_ mischief. That's poor logic. But think over\nwhat I have told you now, while I look over these papers.\"\n\nIn half an hour's time, the Doctor, laying down the documents, again\nturned towards Israel, and removing his spectacles very placidly,\nproceeded in the kindest and most familiar manner to read him a paternal\ndetailed lesson upon the ill-advised act he had been guilty of, upon the\nPont Neuf; concluding by taking out his purse, and putting three small\nsilver coins into Israel's hands, charging him to seek out the man that\nvery day, and make both apology and restitution for his unlucky mistake.\n\n\"All of us, my honest friend,\" continued the Doctor, \"are subject to\nmaking mistakes; so that the chief art of life, is to learn how best to\nremedy mistakes. Now one remedy for mistakes is honesty. So pay the man\nfor the damage done to his box. And now, who are you, my friend? My\ncorrespondents here mention your name--Israel Potter--and say you are an\nAmerican, an escaped prisoner of war, but nothing further. I want to\nhear your story from your own lips.\"\n\nIsrael immediately began, and related to the Doctor all his adventures\nup to the present time.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said the Doctor, upon Israel's concluding, \"that you desire\nto return to your friends across the sea?\"\n\n\"That I do, Doctor,\" said Israel.\n\n\"Well, I think I shall be able to procure you a passage.\"\n\nIsrael's eyes sparkled with delight. The mild sage noticed it, and\nadded: \"But events in these times are uncertain. At the prospect of\npleasure never be elated; but, without depression, respect the omens of\nill. So much my life has taught me, my honest friend.\"\n\nIsrael felt as though a plum-pudding had been thrust under his nostrils,\nand then as rapidly withdrawn.\n\n\"I think it is probable that in two or three days I shall want you to\nreturn with some papers to the persons who sent you to me. In that case\nyou will have to come here once more, and then, my good friend, we will\nsee what can be done towards getting you safely home again.\"\n\nIsrael was pouring out torrents of thanks when the Doctor interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"Gratitude, my friend, cannot be too much towards God, but towards man,\nit should be limited. No man can possibly so serve his fellow, as to\nmerit unbounded gratitude. Over gratitude in the helped person, is apt\nto breed vanity or arrogance in the helping one. Now in assisting you\nto get home--if indeed I shall prove able to do so--I shall be simply\ndoing part of my official duty as agent of our common country. So you\nowe me just nothing at all, but the sum of these coins I put in your\nhand just now. But that, instead of repaying to me hereafter, you can,\nwhen you get home, give to the first soldier's widow you meet. Don't\nforget it, for it is a debt, a pecuniary liability, owing to me. It will\nbe about a quarter of a dollar, in the Yankee currency. A quarter of a\ndollar, mind. My honest friend, in pecuniary matters always be exact as\na second-hand; never mind with whom it is, father or stranger, peasant\nor king, be exact to a tick of your honor.\"\n\n\"Well, Doctor,\" said Israel, \"since exactness in these matters is so\nnecessary, let me pay back my debt in the very coins in which it was\nloaned. There will be no chance of mistake then. Thanks to my Brentford\nfriends, I have enough to spare of my own, to settle damages with the\nboot-black of the bridge. I only took the money from you, because I\nthought it would not look well to push it back after being so kindly\noffered.\"\n\n\"My honest friend,\" said the Doctor, \"I like your straightforward\ndealing. I will receive back the money.\"\n\n\"No interest, Doctor, I hope,\" said Israel.\n\nThe sage looked mildly over his spectacles upon Israel and replied: \"My\ngood friend, never permit yourself to be jocose upon pecuniary matters.\nNever joke at funerals, or during business transactions. The affair\nbetween us two, you perhaps deem very trivial, but trifles may involve\nmomentous principles. But no more at present. You had better go\nimmediately and find the boot-black. Having settled with him, return\nhither, and you will find a room ready for you near this, where you will\nstay during your sojourn in Paris.\"\n\n\"But I thought I would like to have a little look round the town, before\nI go back to England,\" said Israel.\n\n\"Business before pleasure, my friend. You must absolutely remain in your\nroom, just as if you were my prisoner, until you quit Paris for Calais.\nNot knowing now at what instant I shall want you to start, your keeping\nto your room is indispensable. But when you come back from Brentford\nagain, then, if nothing happens, you will have a chance to survey this\ncelebrated capital ere taking ship for America. Now go directly, and pay\nthe boot-black. Stop, have you the exact change ready? Don't be taking\nout all your money in the open street.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" said Israel, \"I am not so simple.\"\n\n\"But you knocked over the box.\"\n\n\"That, Doctor, was bravery.\"\n\n\"Bravery in a poor cause, is the height of simplicity, my friend.--Count\nout your change. It must be French coin, not English, that you are to\npay the man with.--Ah, that will do--those three coins will be enough.\nPut them in a pocket separate from your other cash. Now go, and hasten\nto the bridge.\"\n\n\"Shall I stop to take a meal anywhere, Doctor, as I return? I saw\nseveral cookshops as I came hither.\"\n\n\"Cafes and restaurants, they are called here, my honest friend. Tell\nme, are you the possessor of a liberal fortune?\"\n\n\"Not very liberal,\" said Israel.\n\n\"I thought as much. Where little wine is drunk, it is good to dine out\noccasionally at a friend's; but where a poor man dines out at his own\ncharge, it is bad policy. Never dine out that way, when you can dine in.\nDo not stop on the way at all, my honest friend, but come directly back\nhither, and you shall dine at home, free of cost, with me.\"\n\n\"Thank you very kindly, Doctor.\"\n\nAnd Israel departed for the Pont Neuf. Succeeding in his errand thither,\nhe returned to Dr. Franklin, and found that worthy envoy waiting his\nattendance at a meal, which, according to the Doctor's custom, had been\nsent from a neighboring restaurant. There were two covers; and without\nattendance the host and guest sat down. There was only one principal\ndish, lamb boiled with green peas. Bread and potatoes made up the rest.\nA decanter-like bottle of uncolored glass, filled with some uncolored\nbeverage, stood at the venerable envoy's elbow.\n\n\"Let me fill your glass,\" said the sage.\n\n\"It's white wine, ain't it?\" said Israel.\n\n\"White wine of the very oldest brand; I drink your health in it, my\nhonest friend.\"\n\n\"Why, it's plain water,\" said Israel, now tasting it.\n\n\"Plain water is a very good drink for plain men,\" replied the wise man.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Israel, \"but Squire Woodcock gave me perry, and the other\ngentleman at White Waltham gave me port, and some other friends have\ngiven me brandy.\"\n\n\"Very good, my honest friend; if you like perry and port and brandy,\nwait till you get back to Squire Woodcock, and the gentleman at White\nWaltham, and the other friends, and you shall drink perry and port and\nbrandy. But while you are with me, you will drink plain water.\"\n\n\"So it seems, Doctor.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose a glass of port costs?\"\n\n\"About three pence English, Doctor.\"\n\n\"That must be poor port. But how much good bread will three pence\nEnglish purchase?\"\n\n\"Three penny rolls, Doctor.\"\n\n\"How many glasses of port do you suppose a man may drink at a meal?\"\n\n\"The gentleman at White Waltham drank a bottle at a dinner.\"\n\n\"A bottle contains just thirteen glasses--that's thirty-nine pence,\nsupposing it poor wine. If something of the best, which is the only sort\nany sane man should drink, as being the least poisonous, it would be\nquadruple that sum, which is one hundred and fifty-six pence, which is\nseventy-eight two-penny loaves. Now, do you not think that for one man\nto swallow down seventy-two two-penny rolls at one meal is rather\nextravagant business?\"\n\n\"But he drank a bottle of wine; he did not eat seventy-two two-penny\nrolls, Doctor.\"\n\n\"He drank the money worth of seventy-two loaves, which is drinking the\nloaves themselves; for money is bread.\"\n\n\"But he has plenty of money to spare, Doctor.\"\n\n\"To have to spare, is to have to give away. Does the gentleman give much\naway?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Then he thinks he has nothing to spare; and thinking he has nothing to\nspare, and yet prodigally drinking down his money as he does every day,\nit seems to me that that gentleman stands self-contradicted, and\ntherefore is no good example for plain sensible folks like you and me to\nfollow. My honest friend, if you are poor, avoid wine as a costly\nluxury; if you are rich, shun it as a fatal indulgence. Stick to plain\nwater. And now, my good friend, if you are through with your meal, we\nwill rise. There is no pastry coming. Pastry is poisoned bread. Never\neat pastry. Be a plain man, and stick to plain things. Now, my friend, I\nshall have to be private until nine o'clock in the evening, when I shall\nbe again at your service. Meantime you may go to your room. I have\nordered the one next to this to be prepared for you. But you must not be\nidle. Here is Poor Richard's Almanac, which, in view of our late\nconversation, I commend to your earnest perusal. And here, too, is a\nGuide to Paris, an English one, which you can read. Study it well, so\nthat when you come back from England, if you should then have an\nopportunity to travel about Paris, to see its wonders, you will have all\nthe chief places made historically familiar to you. In this world, men\nmust provide knowledge before it is wanted, just as our countrymen in\nNew England get in their winter's fuel one season, to serve them the\nnext.\"\n\nSo saying, this homely sage, and household Plato, showed his humble\nguest to the door, and standing in the hall, pointed out to him the one\nwhich opened into his allotted apartment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nWHICH HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT DR. FRANKLIN AND THE LATIN QUARTER.\n\n\nThe first, both in point of time and merit, of American envoys was\nfamous not less for the pastoral simplicity of his manners than for the\npolitic grace of his mind. Viewed from a certain point, there was a\ntouch of primeval orientalness in Benjamin Franklin. Neither is there\nwanting something like his Scriptural parallel. The history of the\npatriarch Jacob is interesting not less from the unselfish devotion\nwhich we are bound to ascribe to him, than from the deep worldly wisdom\nand polished Italian tact, gleaming under an air of Arcadian\nunaffectedness. The diplomatist and the shepherd are blended; a union\nnot without warrant; the apostolic serpent and dove. A tanned\nMachiavelli in tents.\n\nDoubtless, too, notwithstanding his eminence as lord of the moving\nmanor, Jacob's raiment was of homespun; the economic envoy's plain coat\nand hose, who has not heard of?\n\nFranklin all over is of a piece. He dressed his person as his periods;\nneat, trim, nothing superfluous, nothing deficient. In some of his works\nhis style is only surpassed by the unimprovable sentences of Hobbes of\nMalmsbury, the paragon of perspicuity. The mental habits of Hobbes and\nFranklin in several points, especially in one of some moment,\nassimilated. Indeed, making due allowance for soil and era, history\npresents few trios more akin, upon the whole, than Jacob, Hobbes, and\nFranklin; three labyrinth-minded, but plain-spoken Broadbrims, at once\npoliticians and philosophers; keen observers of the main chance; prudent\ncourtiers; practical magians in linsey-woolsey.\n\nIn keeping with his general habitudes, Doctor Franklin while at the\nFrench Court did not reside in the aristocratical faubourgs. He deemed\nhis worsted hose and scientific tastes more adapted in a domestic way to\nthe other side of the Seine, where the Latin Quarter, at once the haunt\nof erudition and economy, seemed peculiarly to invite the philosophical\nPoor Richard to its venerable retreats. Here, of gray, chilly, drizzly\nNovember mornings, in the dark-stoned quadrangle of the time-honored\nSorbonne, walked the lean and slippered metaphysician,--oblivious for\nthe moment that his sublime thoughts and tattered wardrobe were famous\nthroughout Europe,--meditating on the theme of his next lecture; at the\nsame time, in the well-worn chambers overhead, some clayey-visaged\nchemist in ragged robe-de-chambre, and with a soiled green flap over his\nleft eye, was hard at work stooping over retorts and crucibles,\ndiscovering new antipathies in acids, again risking strange explosions\nsimilar to that whereby he had already lost the use of one optic; while\nin the lofty lodging-houses of the neighboring streets, indigent young\nstudents from all parts of France, were ironing their shabby cocked\nhats, or inking the whity seams of their small-clothes, prior to a\npromenade with their pink-ribboned little grisettes in the Garden of the\nLuxembourg.\n\nLong ago the haunt of rank, the Latin Quarter still retains many old\nbuildings whose imposing architecture singularly contrasts with the\nunassuming habits of their present occupants. In some parts its general\nair is dreary and dim; monastic and theurgic. In those lonely narrow\nways--long-drawn prospectives of desertion--lined with huge piles of\nsilent, vaulted, old iron-grated buildings of dark gray stone, one\nalmost expects to encounter Paracelsus or Friar Bacon turning the next\ncorner, with some awful vial of Black-Art elixir in his hand.\n\nBut all the lodging-houses are not so grim. Not to speak of many of\ncomparatively modern erection, the others of the better class, however\nstern in exterior, evince a feminine gayety of taste, more or less, in\ntheir furnishings within. The embellishing, or softening, or screening\nhand of woman is to be seen all over the interiors of this metropolis..\nLike Augustus Caesar with respect to Rome, the Frenchwoman leaves her\nobvious mark on Paris. Like the hand in nature, you know it can be none\nelse but hers. Yet sometimes she overdoes it, as nature in the peony; or\nunderdoes it, as nature in the bramble; or--what is still more\nfrequent--is a little slatternly about it, as nature in the pig-weed.\n\nIn this congenial vicinity of the Latin Quarter, and in an ancient\nbuilding something like those alluded to, at a point midway between the\nPalais des Beaux Arts and the College of the Sorbonne, the venerable\nAmerican Envoy pitched his tent when not passing his time at his country\nretreat at Passy. The frugality of his manner of life did not lose him\nthe good opinion even of the voluptuaries of the showiest of capitals,\nwhose very iron railings are not free from gilt. Franklin was not less a\nlady's man, than a man's man, a wise man, and an old man. Not only did\nhe enjoy the homage of the choicest Parisian literati, but at the age of\nseventy-two he was the caressed favorite of the highest born beauties of\nthe Court; who through blind fashion having been originally attracted to\nhim as a famous _savan_, were permanently retained as his admirers by\nhis Plato-like graciousness of good humor. Having carefully weighed the\nworld, Franklin could act any part in it. By nature turned to knowledge,\nhis mind was often grave, but never serious. At times he had\nseriousness--extreme seriousness--for others, but never for himself.\nTranquillity was to him instead of it. This philosophical levity of\ntranquillity, so to speak, is shown in his easy variety of pursuits.\nPrinter, postmaster, almanac maker, essayist, chemist, orator, tinker,\nstatesman, humorist, philosopher, parlor man, political economist,\nprofessor of housewifery, ambassador, projector, maxim-monger,\nherb-doctor, wit:--Jack of all trades, master of each and mastered by\nnone--the type and genius of his land. Franklin was everything but a\npoet. But since a soul with many qualities, forming of itself a sort of\nhandy index and pocket congress of all humanity, needs the contact of\njust as many different men, or subjects, in order to the exhibition of\nits totality; hence very little indeed of the sage's multifariousness\nwill be portrayed in a simple narrative like the present. This casual\nprivate intercourse with Israel, but served to manifest him in his far\nlesser lights; thrifty, domestic, dietarian, and, it may be,\ndidactically waggish. There was much benevolent irony, innocent\nmischievousness, in the wise man. Seeking here to depict him in his less\nexalted habitudes, the narrator feels more as if he were playing with\none of the sage's worsted hose, than reverentially handling the honored\nhat which once oracularly sat upon his brow.\n\nSo, then, in the Latin Quarter lived Doctor Franklin. And accordingly in\nthe Latin Quarter tarried Israel for the time. And it was into a room of\na house in this same Latin Quarter that Israel had been directed when\nthe sage had requested privacy for a while.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nISRAEL IS INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF LODGING-HOUSES IN THE LATIN\nQUARTER.\n\n\nClosing the door upon himself, Israel advanced to the middle of the\nchamber, and looked curiously round him.\n\nA dark tessellated floor, but without a rug; two mahogany chairs, with\nembroidered seats, rather the worse for wear; one mahogany bed, with a\ngay but tarnished counterpane; a marble wash-stand, cracked, with a\nchina vessel of water, minus the handle. The apartment was very large;\nthis part of the house, which was a very extensive one, embracing the\nfour sides of a quadrangle, having, in a former age, been the hotel of a\nnobleman. The magnitude of the chamber made its stinted furniture look\nmeagre enough.\n\nBut in Israel's eyes, the marble mantel (a comparatively recent\naddition) and its appurtenances, not only redeemed the rest, but looked\nquite magnificent and hospitable in the extreme. Because, in the first\nplace, the mantel was graced with an enormous old-fashioned square\nmirror, of heavy plate glass, set fast, like a tablet, into the wall.\nAnd in this mirror was genially reflected the following delicate\narticles:--first, two boquets of flowers inserted in pretty vases of\nporcelain; second, one cake of white soap; third, one cake of\nrose-colored soap (both cakes very fragrant); fourth, one wax candle;\nfifth, one china tinder-box; sixth, one bottle of Eau de Cologne;\nseventh, one paper of loaf sugar, nicely broken into sugar-bowl size;\neighth, one silver teaspoon; ninth, one glass tumbler; tenth, one glass\ndecanter of cool pure water; eleventh, one sealed bottle containing a\nrichly hued liquid, and marked \"Otard.\"\n\n\"I wonder now what O-t-a-r-d is?\" soliloquised Israel, slowly spelling\nthe word. \"I have a good mind to step in and ask Dr. Franklin. He knows\neverything. Let me smell it. No, it's sealed; smell is locked in. Those\nare pretty flowers. Let's smell them: no smell again. Ah, I see--sort of\nflowers in women's bonnets--sort of calico flowers. Beautiful soap. This\nsmells anyhow--regular soap-roses--a white rose and a red one. That\nlong-necked bottle there looks like a crane. I wonder what's in that?\nHallo! E-a-u--d-e--C-o-l-o-g-n-e. I wonder if Dr. Franklin understands\nthat? It looks like his white wine. This is nice sugar. Let's taste.\nYes, this is very nice sugar, sweet as--yes, it's sweet as sugar; better\nthan maple sugar, such as they make at home. But I'm crunching it too\nloud, the Doctor will hear me. But here's a teaspoon. What's this for?\nThere's no tea, nor tea-cup; but here's a tumbler, and here's drinking\nwater. Let me see. Seems to me, putting this and that and the other\nthing together, it's a sort of alphabet that spells something. Spoon,\ntumbler, water, sugar,--brandy--that's it. O-t-a-r-d is brandy. Who put\nthese things here? What does it all mean? Don't put sugar here for show,\ndon't put a spoon here for ornament, nor a jug of water. There is only\none meaning to it, and that is a very polite invitation from some\ninvisible person to help myself, if I like, to a glass of brandy and\nsugar, and if I don't like, let it alone. That's my reading. I have a\ngood mind to ask Doctor Franklin about it, though, for there's just a\nchance I may be mistaken, and these things here be some other person's\nprivate property, not at all meant for me to help myself from. Cologne,\nwhat's that--never mind. Soap: soap's to wash with. I want to use soap,\nanyway. Let me see--no, there's no soap on the wash-stand. I see, soap\nis not given gratis here in Paris, to boarders. But if you want it, take\nit from the marble, and it will be charged in the bill. If you don't\nwant it let it alone, and no charge. Well, that's fair, anyway. But then\nto a man who could not afford to use soap, such beautiful cakes as these\nlying before his eyes all the time, would be a strong temptation. And\nnow that I think of it, the O-t-a-r-d looks rather tempting too. But if\nI don't like it now, I can let it alone. I've a good mind to try it. But\nit's sealed. I wonder now if I am right in my understanding of this\nalphabet? Who knows? I'll venture one little sip, anyhow. Come, cork.\nHark!\"\n\nThere was a rapid knock at the door.\n\nClapping down the bottle, Israel said, \"Come in.\"\n\nIt was the man of wisdom.\n\n\"My honest friend,\" said the Doctor, stepping with venerable briskness\ninto the room, \"I was so busy during your visit to the Pont Neuf, that I\ndid not have time to see that your room was all right. I merely gave the\norder, and heard that it had been fulfilled. But it just occurred to me,\nthat as the landladies of Paris have some curious customs which might\npuzzle an entire stranger, my presence here for a moment might explain\nany little obscurity. Yes, it is as I thought,\" glancing towards the\nmantel.\n\n\"Oh, Doctor, that reminds me; what is O-t-a-r-d, pray?\"\n\n\"Otard is poison.\"\n\n\"Shocking.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I think I had best remove it from the room forthwith,\" replied\nthe sage, in a business-like manner putting the bottle under his arm; \"I\nhope you never use Cologne, do you?\"\n\n\"What--what is that, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I see. You never heard of the senseless luxury--a wise ignorance. You\nsmelt flowers upon your mountains. You won't want this, either;\" and the\nCologne bottle was put under the other arm. \"Candle--you'll want that.\nSoap--you want soap. Use the white cake.\"\n\n\"Is that cheaper, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes, but just as good as the other. You don't ever munch sugar, do you?\nIt's bad for the teeth. I'll take the sugar.\" So the paper of sugar was\nlikewise dropped into one of the capacious coat pockets.\n\n\"Oh, you better take the whole furniture, Doctor Franklin. Here, I'll\nhelp you drag out the bedstead.\" \"My honest friend,\" said the wise man,\npausing solemnly, with the two bottles, like swimmer's bladders, under\nhis arm-pits; \"my honest friend, the bedstead you will want; what I\npropose to remove you will not want.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was only joking, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I knew that. It's a bad habit, except at the proper time, and with the\nproper person. The things left on the mantel were there placed by the\nlandlady to be used if wanted; if not, to be left untouched. To-morrow\nmorning, upon the chambermaid's coming in to make your bed, all such\narticles as remained obviously untouched would have been removed, the\nrest would have been charged in the bill, whether you used them up\ncompletely or not.\"\n\n\"Just as I thought. Then why not let the bottles stay, Doctor, and save\nyourself all this trouble?\"\n\n\"Ah! why indeed. My honest friend, are you not my guest? It were\nunhandsome in me to permit a third person superfluously to entertain you\nunder what, for the time being, is my own roof.\"\n\nThese words came from the wise man in the most graciously bland and\nflowing tones. As he ended, he made a sort of conciliatory half bow\ntowards Israel.\n\nCharmed with his condescending affability, Israel, without another word,\nsuffered him to march from the room, bottles and all. Not till the first\nimpression of the venerable envoy's suavity had left him, did Israel\nbegin to surmise the mild superiority of successful strategy which\nlurked beneath this highly ingratiating air.\n\n\"Ah,\" pondered Israel, sitting gloomily before the rifled mantel, with\nthe empty tumbler and teaspoon in his hand, \"it's sad business to have a\nDoctor Franklin lodging in the next room. I wonder if he sees to all the\nboarders this way. How the O-t-a-r-d merchants must hate him, and the\npastry-cooks too. I wish I had a good pie to pass the time. I wonder if\nthey ever make pumpkin pies in Paris? So I've got to stay in this room\nall the time. Somehow I'm bound to be a prisoner, one way or another.\nNever mind, I'm an ambassador; that's satisfaction. Hark! The Doctor\nagain.--Come in.\"\n\nNo venerable doctor, but in tripped a young French lass, bloom on her\ncheek, pink ribbons in her cap, liveliness in all her air, grace in the\nvery tips of her elbows. The most bewitching little chambermaid in\nParis. All art, but the picture of artlessness.\n\n\"Monsieur! pardon!\"\n\n\"Oh, I pardon ye freely,\" said Israel. \"Come to call on the\nAmbassador?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, is de--de--\" but, breaking down at the very threshold in her\nEnglish, she poured out a long ribbon of sparkling French, the purpose\nof which was to convey a profusion of fine compliments to the stranger,\nwith many tender inquiries as to whether he was comfortably roomed, and\nwhether there might not be something, however trifling, wanting to his\ncomplete accommodation. But Israel understood nothing, at the time, but\nthe exceeding grace, and trim, bewitching figure of the girl.\n\nShe stood eyeing him for a few moments more, with a look of pretty\ntheatrical despair, and, after vaguely lingering a while, with another\nshower of incomprehensible compliments and apologies, tripped like a\nfairy from the chamber. Directly she was gone Israel pondered upon a\nsingular glance of the girl. It seemed to him that he had, by his\nreception, in some way, unaccountably disappointed his beautiful\nvisitor. It struck him very strangely that she had entered all sweetness\nand friendliness, but had retired as if slighted, with a sort of\ndisdainful and sarcastic levity, all the more stinging from its apparent\npoliteness.\n\nNot long had she disappeared, when a noise in the passage apprised him\nthat, in her hurried retreat, the girl must have stumbled against\nsomething. The next moment he heard a chair scraping in the adjacent\napartment, and there was another knock at the door.\n\nIt was the man of wisdom this time.\n\n\"My honest friend, did you not have a visitor, just now?\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor, a very pretty girl called upon me.\"\n\n\"Well, I just stopped in to tell you of another strange custom of Paris.\nThat girl is the chambermaid, but she does not confine herself\naltogether to one vocation. You must beware of the chambermaids of\nParis, my honest friend. Shall I tell the girl, from you, that,\nunwilling to give her the fatigue of going up and down so many flights\nof stairs, you will for the future waive her visits of ceremony?\"\n\n\"Why, Doctor Franklin, she is a very sweet little girl.\"\n\n\"I know it, my honest friend; the sweeter the more dangerous. Arsenic is\nsweeter than sugar. I know you are a very sensible young man, not to be\ntaken in by an artful Ammonite, and so I think I had better convey your\nmessage to the girl forthwith.\"\n\nSo saying, the sage withdrew, leaving Israel once more gloomily seated\nbefore the rifled mantel, whose mirror was not again to reflect the form\nof the charming chambermaid.\n\n\"Every time he comes in he robs me,\" soliloquised Israel, dolefully;\n\"with an air all the time, too, as if he were making me presents. If he\nthinks me such a very sensible young man, why not let me take care of\nmyself?\"\n\nIt was growing dusk, and Israel, lighting the wax candle, proceeded to\nread in his Guide-book.\n\n\"This is poor sight-seeing,\" muttered he at last, \"sitting here all by\nmyself, with no company but an empty tumbler, reading about the fine\nthings in Paris, and I myself a prisoner in Paris. I wish something\nextraordinary would turn up now; for instance, a man come in and give me\nten thousand pounds. But here's 'Poor Richard;' I am a poor fellow\nmyself; so let's see what comfort he has for a comrade.\"\n\nOpening the little pamphlet, at random, Israel's eyes fell on the\nfollowing passages: he read them aloud--\n\n\"'_So what signifies waiting and hoping for better times? We may make\nthese times better, if we bestir ourselves. Industry need not wish, and\nhe that lives upon hope will die fasting, as Poor Richard says. There\nare no gains, without pains. Then help hands, for I have no lands, as\nPoor Richard says._' Oh, confound all this wisdom! It's a sort of\ninsulting to talk wisdom to a man like me. It's wisdom that's cheap,\nand it's fortune that's dear. That ain't in Poor Richard; but it ought\nto be,\" concluded Israel, suddenly slamming down the pamphlet.\n\nHe walked across the room, looked at the artificial flowers, and the\nrose-colored soap, and again went to the table and took up the two\nbooks.\n\n\"So here is the 'Way to Wealth,' and here is the 'Guide to Paris.'\nWonder now whether Paris lies on the Way to Wealth? if so, I am on the\nroad. More likely though, it's a parting-of-the-ways. I shouldn't be\nsurprised if the Doctor meant something sly by putting these two books\nin my hand. Somehow, the old gentleman has an amazing sly look--a sort\nof wild slyness--about him, seems to me. His wisdom seems a sort of sly,\ntoo. But all in honor, though. I rather think he's one of those old\ngentlemen who say a vast deal of sense, but hint a world more. Depend\nupon it, he's sly, sly, sly. Ah, what's this Poor Richard says: 'God\nhelps them that help themselves:' Let's consider that. Poor Richard\nain't a Dunker, that's certain, though he has lived in Pennsylvania.\n'God helps them that help themselves.' I'll just mark that saw, and\nleave the pamphlet open to refer to it again--Ah!\"\n\nAt this point, the Doctor knocked, summoning Israel to his own\napartment. Here, after a cup of weak tea, and a little toast, the two\nhad a long, familiar talk together; during which, Israel was delighted\nwith the unpretending talkativeness, serene insight, and benign\namiability of the sage. But, for all this, he could hardly forgive him\nfor the Cologne and Otard depredations.\n\nDiscovering that, in early life, Israel had been employed on a farm,\nthe man of wisdom at length turned the conversation in that direction;\namong other things, mentioning to his guest a plan of his (the Doctor's)\nfor yoking oxen, with a yoke to go by a spring instead of a bolt; thus\ngreatly facilitating the operation of hitching on the team to the cart.\nIsrael was very much struck with the improvement; and thought that, if\nhe were home, upon his mountains, he would immediately introduce it\namong the farmers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nANOTHER ADVENTURER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE.\n\n\nAbout half-past ten o'clock, as they were thus conversing, Israel's\nacquaintance, the pretty chambermaid, rapped at the door, saying, with a\ntitter, that a very rude gentleman in the passage of the court, desired\nto see Doctor Franklin.\n\n\"A very rude gentleman?\" repeated the wise man in French, narrowly\nlooking at the girl; \"that means, a very fine gentleman who has just\npaid you some energetic compliment. But let him come up, my girl,\" he\nadded patriarchially.\n\nIn a few moments, a swift coquettish step was heard, followed, as if in\nchase, by a sharp and manly one. The door opened. Israel was sitting so\nthat, accidentally, his eye pierced the crevice made by the opening of\nthe door, which, like a theatrical screen, stood for a moment between\nDoctor Franklin and the just entering visitor. And behind that screen,\nthrough the crack, Israel caught one momentary glimpse of a little bit\nof by-play between the pretty chambermaid and the stranger. The\nvivacious nymph appeared to have affectedly run from him on the\nstairs--doubtless in freakish return for some liberal advances--but had\nsuffered herself to be overtaken at last ere too late; and on the\ninstant Israel caught sight of her, was with an insincere air of rosy\nresentment, receiving a roguish pinch on the arm, and a still more\nroguish salute on the cheek.\n\nThe next instant both disappeared from the range of the crevice; the\ngirl departing whence she had come; the stranger--transiently invisible\nas he advanced behind the door--entering the room. When Israel now\nperceived him again, he seemed, while momentarily hidden, to have\nundergone a complete transformation.\n\nHe was a rather small, elastic, swarthy man, with an aspect as of a\ndisinherited Indian Chief in European clothes. An unvanquishable\nenthusiasm, intensified to perfect sobriety, couched in his savage,\nself-possessed eye. He was elegantly and somewhat extravagantly dressed\nas a civilian; he carried himself with a rustic, barbaric jauntiness,\nstrangely dashed with a superinduced touch of the Parisian _salon_. His\ntawny cheek, like a date, spoke of the tropic, A wonderful atmosphere of\nproud friendlessness and scornful isolation invested him. Yet there was\na bit of the poet as well as the outlaw in him, too. A cool solemnity of\nintrepidity sat on his lip. He looked like one who of purpose sought out\nharm's way. He looked like one who never had been, and never would be, a\nsubordinate.\n\nIsrael thought to himself that seldom before had he seen such a being.\nThough dressed \u00c3\u00a0-la-mode, he did not seem to be altogether civilized.\n\nSo absorbed was our adventurer by the person of the stranger, that a few\nmoments passed ere he began to be aware of the circumstance, that Dr.\nFranklin and this new visitor having saluted as old acquaintances, were\nnow sitting in earnest conversation together.\n\n\"Do as you please; but I will not bide a suitor much longer,\" said the\nstranger in bitterness. \"Congress gave me to understand that, upon my\narrival here, I should be given immediate command of the _Indien_; and\nnow, for no earthly reason that I can see, you Commissioners have\npresented her, fresh from the stocks at Amsterdam, to the King of\nFrance, and not to me. What does the King of France with such a frigate?\nAnd what can I _not_ do with her? Give me back the \"Indien,\" and in less\nthan one month, you shall hear glorious or fatal news of Paul Jones.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Captain,\" said Doctor Franklin, soothingly, \"tell me now,\nwhat would you do with her, if you had her?\"\n\n\"I would teach the British that Paul Jones, though born in Britain, is\nno subject to the British King, but an untrammelled citizen and sailor\nof the universe; and I would teach them, too, that if they ruthlessly\nravage the American coasts, their own coasts are vulnerable as New\nHolland's. Give me the _Indien_, and I will rain down on wicked England\nlike fire on Sodom.\"\n\nThese words of bravado were not spoken in the tone of a bravo, but a\nprophet. Erect upon his chair, like an Iroquois, the speaker's look was\nlike that of an unflickering torch.\n\nHis air seemed slightly to disturb the old sage's philosophic repose,\nwho, while not seeking to disguise his admiration of the unmistakable\nspirit of the man, seemed but illy to relish his apparent measureless\nboasting.\n\nAs if both to change the subject a little, as well as put his visitor in\nbetter mood--though indeed it might have been but covertly to play with\nhis enthusiasm--the man of wisdom now drew his chair confidentially\nnearer to the stranger's, and putting one hand in a very friendly,\nconciliatory way upon his visitor's knee, and rubbing it gently to and\nfro there, much as a lion-tamer might soothingly manipulate the\naggravated king of beasts, said in a winning manner:--\"Never mind at\npresent, Captain, about the '_Indien_' affair. Let that sleep a moment.\nSee now, the Jersey privateers do us a great deal of mischief by\nintercepting our supplies. It has been mentioned to me, that if you had\na small vessel--say, even your present ship, the 'Amphitrite,'--then, by\nyour singular bravery, you might render great service, by following\nthose privateers where larger ships durst not venture their bottoms; or,\nif but supported by some frigates from Brest at a proper distance, might\ndraw them out, so that the larger vessels could capture them.\"\n\n\"Decoy-duck to French frigates!--Very dignified office, truly!\" hissed\nPaul in a fiery rage. \"Doctor Franklin, whatever Paul Jones does for the\ncause of America, it must be done through unlimited orders: a separate,\nsupreme command; no leader and no counsellor but himself. Have I not\nalready by my services on the American coast shown that I am well worthy\nall this? Why then do you seek to degrade me below my previous level? I\nwill mount, not sink. I live but for honor and glory. Give me, then,\nsomething honorable and glorious to do, and something famous to do it\nwith. Give me the _Indien_\"\n\nThe man of wisdom slowly shook his head. \"Everything is lost through\nthis shillyshallying timidity, called prudence,\" cried Paul Jones,\nstarting to his feet; \"to be effectual, war should be carried on like a\nmonsoon, one changeless determination of every particle towards the one\nunalterable aim. But in vacillating councils, statesmen idle about like\nthe cats'-paws in calms. My God, why was I not born a Czar!\"\n\n\"A Nor'wester, rather. Come, come, Captain,\" added the sage, \"sit down,\nwe have a third person present, you see,\" pointing towards Israel, who\nsat rapt at the volcanic spirit of the stranger.\n\nPaul slightly started, and turned inquiringly upon Israel, who, equally\nowing to Paul's own earnestness of discourse and Israel's motionless\nbearing, had thus far remained undiscovered.\n\n\"Never fear, Captain,\" said the sage, \"this man is true blue, a secret\ncourier, and an American born. He is an escaped prisoner of war.\"\n\n\"Ah, captured in a ship?\" asked Paul eagerly; \"what ship? None of mine!\nPaul Jones never was captured.\"\n\n\"No, sir, in the brigantine Washington, out of Boston,\" replied Israel;\n\"we were cruising to cut off supplies to the English.\"\n\n\"Did your shipmates talk much of me?\" demanded Paul, with a look as of\na parading Sioux demanding homage to his gewgaws; \"what did they say of\nPaul Jones?\"\n\n\"I never heard the name before this evening,\" said Israel.\n\n\"What? Ah--brigantine Washington--let me see; that was before I had\noutwitted the Soleby frigate, fought the Milford, and captured the\nMellish and the rest off Louisbergh. You were long before the news, my\nlad,\" he added, with a sort of compassionate air.\n\n\"Our friend here gave you a rather blunt answer,\" said the wise man,\nsagely mischievous, and addressing Paul.\n\n\"Yes. And I like him for it. My man, will you go a cruise with Paul\nJones? You fellows so blunt with the tongue, are apt to be sharp with\nthe steel. Come, my lad, return with me to Brest. I go in a few days.\"\n\nFired by the contagious spirit of Paul, Israel, forgetting all about his\nprevious desire to reach home, sparkled with response to the summons.\nBut Doctor Franklin interrupted him.\n\n\"Our friend here,\" said he to the Captain, \"is at present engaged for\nvery different duty.\"\n\nMuch other conversation followed, during which Paul Jones again and\nagain expressed his impatience at being unemployed, and his resolution\nto accept of no employ unless it gave him supreme authority; while in\nanswer to all this Dr. Franklin, not uninfluenced by the uncompromising\nspirit of his guest, and well knowing that however unpleasant a trait\nin conversation, or in the transaction of civil affairs, yet in war this\nvery quality was invaluable, as projectiles and combustibles, finally\nassured Paul, after many complimentary remarks, that he would\nimmediately exert himself to the utmost to procure for him some\nenterprise which should come up to his merits.\n\n\"Thank you for your frankness,\" said Paul; \"frank myself, I love to deal\nwith a frank man. You, Doctor Franklin, are true and deep, and so you\nare frank.\"\n\nThe sage sedately smiled, a queer incredulity just lurking in the corner\nof his mouth.\n\n\"But how about our little scheme for new modelling ships-of-war?\" said\nthe Doctor, shifting the subject; \"it will be a great thing for our\ninfant navy, if we succeed. Since our last conversation on that subject,\nCaptain, at odds and ends of time, I have thought over the matter, and\nhave begun a little skeleton of the thing here, which I will show you.\nWhenever one has a new idea of anything mechanical, it is best to clothe\nit with a body as soon as possible. For you can't improve so well on\nideas as you can on bodies.\"\n\nWith that, going to a little drawer, he produced a small basket, filled\nwith a curious looking unfinished frame-work of wood, and several bits\nof wood unattached. It looked like a nursery basket containing broken\nodds and ends of playthings.\n\n\"Now look here, Captain, though the thing is but begun at present, yet\nthere is enough to show that _one_ idea at least of yours is not\nfeasible.\"\n\nPaul was all attention, as if having unbounded confidence in whatever\nthe sage might suggest, while Israel looked on quite as interested as\neither, his heart swelling with the thought of being privy to the\nconsultations of two such men; consultations, too, having ultimate\nreference to such momentous affairs as the freeing of nations.\n\n\"If,\" continued the Doctor, taking up some of the loose bits and piling\nthem along on one side of the top of the frame, \"if the better to\nshelter your crew in an engagement, you construct your rail in the\nmanner proposed--as thus--then, by the excessive weight of the timber,\nyou will too much interfere with the ship's centre of gravity. You will\nhave that too high.\"\n\n\"Ballast in the hold in proportion,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Then you will sink the whole hull too low. But here, to have less smoke\nin time of battle, especially on the lower decks, you proposed a new\nsort of hatchway. But that won't do. See here now, I have invented\ncertain ventilating pipes, they are to traverse the vessel thus\"--laying\nsome toilette pins along--\"the current of air to enter here and be\ndischarged there. What do you think of that? But now about the main\nthings--fast sailing driving little to leeward, and drawing little\nwater. Look now at this keel. I whittled it only night before last, just\nbefore going to bed. Do you see now how\"--\n\nAt this crisis, a knock was heard at the door, and the chambermaid\nreappeared, announcing that two gentlemen were that moment crossing the\ncourt below to see Doctor Franklin.\n\n\"The Duke de Chartres, and Count D'Estang,\" said the Doctor; \"they\nappointed for last night, but did not come. Captain, this has something\nindirectly to do with your affair. Through the Duke, Count D'Estang has\nspoken to the King about the secret expedition, the design of which you\nfirst threw out. Call early to-morrow, and I will inform you of the\nresult.\"\n\nWith his tawny hand Paul pulled out his watch, a small, richly-jewelled\nlady's watch.\n\n\"It is so late, I will stay here to-night,\" he said; \"is there a\nconvenient room?\"\n\n\"Quick,\" said the Doctor, \"it might be ill-advised of you to be seen\nwith me just now. Our friend here will let you share his chamber. Quick,\nIsrael, and show the Captain thither.\"\n\nAs the door closed upon them in Israel's apartment, Doctor Franklin's\ndoor closed upon the Duke and the Count. Leaving the latter to their\ndiscussion of profound plans for the timely befriending of the American\ncause, and the crippling of the power of England on the seas, let us\npass the night with Paul Jones and Israel in the neighboring room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nPAUL JONES IN A REVERIE.\n\n\n\"'God helps them that help themselves.' That's a clincher. That's been\nmy experience. But I never saw it in words before. What pamphlet is\nthis? 'Poor Richard,' hey!\"\n\nUpon entering Israel's room, Captain Paul, stepping towards the table\nand spying the open pamphlet there, had taken it up, his eye being\nimmediately attracted to the passage previously marked by our\nadventurer.\n\n\"A rare old gentleman is 'Poor Richard,'\" said Israel in response to\nPaul's observations.\n\n\"So he seems, so he seems,\" answered Paul, his eye still running over\nthe pamphlet again; \"why, 'Poor Richard' reads very much as Doctor\nFranklin speaks.\"\n\n\"He wrote it,\" said Israel.\n\n\"Aye? Good. So it is, so it is; it's the wise man all over. I must get\nme a copy of this and wear it around my neck for a charm. And now about\nour quarters for the night. I am not going to deprive you of your bed,\nmy man. Do you go to bed and I will doze in the chair here. It's good\ndozing in the crosstrees.\"\n\n\"Why not sleep together?\" said Israel; \"see, it is a big bed. Or perhaps\nyou don't fancy your bed-fellow. Captain?\"\n\n\"When, before the mast, I first sailed out of Whitehaven to Norway,\"\nsaid Paul, coolly, \"I had for hammock-mate a full-blooded Congo. We had\na white blanket spread in our hammock. Every time I turned in I found\nthe Congo's black wool worked in with the white worsted. By the end of\nthe voyage the blanket was of a pepper-and-salt look, like an old man's\nturning head. So it's not because I am notional at all, but because I\ndon't care to, my lad. Turn in and go to sleep. Let the lamp burn. I'll\nsee to it. There, go to sleep.\"\n\nComplying with what seemed as much a command as a request, Israel,\nthough in bed, could not fall into slumber for thinking of the little\ncircumstance that this strange swarthy man, flaming with wild\nenterprises, sat in full suit in the chair. He felt an uneasy misgiving\nsensation, as if he had retired, not only without covering up the fire,\nbut leaving it fiercely burning with spitting fagots of hemlock.\n\nBut his natural complaisance induced him at least to feign himself\nasleep; whereupon. Paul, laying down \"Poor Richard,\" rose from his\nchair, and, withdrawing his boots, began walking rapidly but noiselessly\nto and fro, in his stockings, in the spacious room, wrapped in Indian\nmeditations. Israel furtively eyed him from beneath the coverlid, and\nwas anew struck by his aspect, now that Paul thought himself unwatched.\nStern relentless purposes, to be pursued to the points of adverse\nbayonets and the muzzles of hostile cannon, were expressed in the now\nrigid lines of his brow. His ruffled right hand was clutched by his\nside, as if grasping a cutlass. He paced the room as if advancing upon a\nfortification. Meantime a confused buzz of discussion came from the\nneighboring chamber. All else was profound midnight tranquillity.\nPresently, passing the large mirror over the mantel, Paul caught a\nglimpse of his person. He paused, grimly regarding it, while a dash of\npleased coxcombry seemed to mingle with the otherwise savage\nsatisfaction expressed in his face. But the latter predominated. Soon,\nrolling up his sleeve, with a queer wild smile, Paul lifted his right\narm, and stood thus for an interval, eyeing its image in the glass. From\nwhere he lay, Israel could not see that side of the arm presented to the\nmirror, but he saw its reflection, and started at perceiving there,\nframed in the carved and gilded wood, certain large intertwisted ciphers\ncovering the whole inside of the arm, so far as exposed, with mysterious\ntattooings. The design was wholly unlike the fanciful figures of\nanchors, hearts, and cables, sometimes decorating small portions of\nseamen's bodies. It was a sort of tattooing such as is seen only on\nthoroughbred savages--deep blue, elaborate, labyrinthine, cabalistic.\nIsrael remembered having beheld, on one of his early voyages, something\nsimilar on the arm of a New Zealand warrior, once met, fresh from\nbattle, in his native village. He concluded that on some similar early\nvoyage Paul must have undergone the manipulations of some pagan artist.\nCovering his arm again with his laced coat-sleeve, Paul glanced\nironically at the hand of the same arm, now again half muffled in\nruffles, and ornamented with several Parisian rings. He then resumed his\nwalking with a prowling air, like one haunting an ambuscade; while a\ngleam of the consciousness of possessing a character as yet un-fathomed,\nand hidden power to back unsuspected projects, irradiated his cold white\nbrow, which, owing to the shade of his hat in equatorial climates, had\nbeen left surmounting his swarthy face, like the snow topping the Andes.\n\nSo at midnight, the heart of the metropolis of modern civilization was\nsecretly trod by this jaunty barbarian in broadcloth; a sort of\nprophetical ghost, glimmering in anticipation upon the advent of those\ntragic scenes of the French Revolution which levelled the exquisite\nrefinement of Paris with the bloodthirsty ferocity of Borneo; showing\nthat broaches and finger-rings, not less than nose-rings and tattooing,\nare tokens of the primeval savageness which ever slumbers in human kind,\ncivilized or uncivilized.\n\nIsrael slept not a wink that night. The troubled spirit of Paul paced\nthe chamber till morning; when, copiously bathing himself at the\nwash-stand, Paul looked care-free and fresh as a daybreak hawk. After a\ncloseted consultation with Doctor Franklin, he left the place with a\nlight and dandified air, switching his gold-headed cane, and throwing a\npassing arm round all the pretty chambermaids he encountered, kissing\nthem resoundingly, as if saluting a frigate. All barbarians are rakes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nRECROSSING THE CHANNEL, ISRAEL RETURNS TO THE SQUIRE'S ABODE--HIS\nADVENTURES THERE.\n\n\nOn the third day, as Israel was walking to and fro in his room, having\nremoved his courier's boots, for fear of disturbing the Doctor, a quick\nsharp rap at the door announced the American envoy. The man of wisdom\nentered, with two small wads of paper in one hand, and several crackers\nand a bit of cheese in the other. There was such an eloquent air of\ninstantaneous dispatch about him, that Israel involuntarily sprang to\nhis boots, and, with two vigorous jerks, hauled them on, and then\nseizing his hat, like any bird, stood poised for his flight across the\nchannel.\n\n\"Well done, my honest friend,\" said the Doctor; \"you have the papers in\nyour heel, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed Israel, perceiving the mild irony; and in an instant his\nboots were off again; when, without another word, the Doctor took one\nboot, and Israel the other, and forthwith both parties proceeded to\nsecrete the documents.\n\n\"I think I could improve the design,\" said the sage, as,\nnotwithstanding his haste, he critically eyed the screwing apparatus of\nthe boot. \"The vacancy should have been in the standing part of the\nheel, not in the lid. It should go with a spring, too, for better\ndispatch. I'll draw up a paper on false heels one of these days, and\nsend it to a private reading at the Institute. But no time for it now.\nMy honest friend, it is now half past ten o'clock. At half past eleven\nthe diligence starts from the Place-du-Carrousel for Calais. Make all\nhaste till you arrive at Brentford. I have a little provender here for\nyou to eat in the diligence, as you will not have time for a regular\nmeal. A day-and-night courier should never be without a cracker in his\npocket. You will probably leave Brentford in a day or two after your\narrival there. Be wary, now, my good friend; heed well, that, if you are\ncaught with these papers on British ground, you will involve both\nyourself and our Brentford friends in fatal calamities. Kick no man's\nbox, never mind whose, in the way. Mind your own box. You can't be too\ncautious, but don't be too suspicious. God bless you, my honest friend.\nGo!\"\n\nAnd, flinging the door open for his exit, the Doctor saw Israel dart\ninto the entry, vigorously spring down the stairs, and disappear with\nall celerity across the court into the vaulted way.\n\nThe man of wisdom stood mildly motionless a moment, with a look of\nsagacious, humane meditation on his face, as if pondering upon the\nchances of the important enterprise: one which, perhaps, might in the\nsequel affect the weal or woe of nations yet to come. Then suddenly\nclapping his hand to his capacious coat-pocket, dragged out a bit of\ncork with some hen's feathers, and hurrying to his room, took out his\nknife, and proceeded to whittle away at a shuttlecock of an original\nscientific construction, which at some prior time he had promised to\nsend to the young Duchess D'Abrantes that very afternoon.\n\nSafely reaching Calais, at night, Israel stepped almost from the\ndiligence into the packet, and, in a few moments, was cutting the water.\nAs on the diligence he took an outside and plebeian seat, so, with the\nsame secret motive of preserving unsuspected the character assumed, he\ntook a deck passage in the packet. It coming on to rain violently, he\nstole down into the forecastle, dimly lit by a solitary swinging lamp,\nwhere were two men industriously smoking, and filling the narrow hole\nwith soporific vapors. These induced strange drowsiness in Israel, and\nhe pondered how best he might indulge it, for a time, without\nimperilling the precious documents in his custody.\n\nBut this pondering in such soporific vapors had the effect of those\nmathematical devices whereby restless people cipher themselves to sleep.\nHis languid head fell to his breast. In another moment, he drooped\nhalf-lengthwise upon a chest, his legs outstretched before him.\n\nPresently he was awakened by some intermeddlement with his feet.\nStarting to his elbow, he saw one of the two men in the act of slyly\nslipping off his right boot, while the left one, already removed, lay on\nthe floor, all ready against the rascal's retreat Had it not been for\nthe lesson learned on the Pont Neuf, Israel would instantly have\ninferred that his secret mission was known, and the operator some\ndesigned diplomatic knave or other, hired by the British Cabinet, thus\nto lie in wait for him, fume him into slumber with tobacco, and then\nrifle him of his momentous dispatches. But as it was, he recalled Doctor\nFranklin's prudent admonitions against the indulgence of premature\nsuspicions.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Israel very civilly, \"I will thank you for that boot which\nlies on the floor, and, if you please, you can let the other stay where\nit is.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the rascal, an accomplished, self-possessed\npractitioner in his thievish art; \"I thought your boots might be\npinching you, and only wished to ease you a little.\"\n\n\"Much obliged to ye for your kindness, sir,\" said Israel; \"but they\ndon't pinch me at all. I suppose, though, you think they wouldn't pinch\n_you_ either; your foot looks rather small. Were you going to try 'em\non, just to see how they fitted?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the fellow, with sanctimonious seriousness; \"but with your\npermission I should like to try them on, when we get to Dover. I\ncouldn't try them well walking on this tipsy craft's deck, you know.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Israel, \"and the beach at Dover ain't very smooth either.\nI guess, upon second thought, you had better not try 'em on at all.\nBesides, I am a simple sort of a soul--eccentric they call me--and don't\nlike my boots to go out of my sight. Ha! ha!\"\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\" said the fellow testily.\n\n\"Odd idea! I was just looking at those sad old patched boots there on\nyour feet, and thinking to myself what leaky fire-buckets they would be\nto pass up a ladder on a burning building. It would hardly be fair now\nto swop my new boots for those old fire-buckets, would it?\"\n\n\"By plunko!\" cried the fellow, willing now by a bold stroke to change\nthe subject, which was growing slightly annoying; \"by plunko, I believe\nwe are getting nigh Dover. Let's see.\"\n\nAnd so saying, he sprang up the ladder to the deck. Upon Israel\nfollowing, he found the little craft half becalmed, rolling on short\nswells almost in the exact middle of the channel. It was just before the\nbreak of the morning; the air clear and fine; the heavens spangled with\nmoistly twinkling stars. The French and English coasts lay distinctly\nvisible in the strange starlight, the white cliffs of Dover resembling a\nlong gabled block of marble houses. Both shores showed a long straight\nrow of lamps. Israel seemed standing in the middle of the crossing of\nsome wide stately street in London. Presently a breeze sprang up, and\nere long our adventurer disembarked at his destined port, and directly\nposted on for Brentford.\n\nThe following afternoon, having gained unobserved admittance into the\nhouse, according to preconcerted signals, he was sitting in Squire\nWoodcock's closet, pulling off his boots and delivering his dispatches.\n\nHaving looked over the compressed tissuey sheets, and read a line\nparticularly addressed to himself, the Squire, turning round upon\nIsrael, congratulated him upon his successful mission, placed some\nrefreshment before him, and apprised him that, owing to certain\nsuspicious symptoms in the neighborhood, he (Israel) must now remain\nconcealed in the house for a day or two, till an answer should be ready\nfor Paris.\n\nIt was a venerable mansion, as was somewhere previously stated, of a\nwide and rambling disorderly spaciousness, built, for the most part, of\nweather-stained old bricks, in the goodly style called Elizabethan. As\nwithout, it was all dark russet bricks, so within, it was nothing but\ntawny oak panels.\n\n\"Now, my good fellow,\" said the Squire, \"my wife has a number of\nguests, who wander from room to room, having the freedom of the house.\nSo I shall have to put you very snugly away, to guard against any chance\nof discovery.\"\n\nSo saying, first locking the door, he touched a spring nigh the open\nfire-place, whereupon one of the black sooty stone jambs of the chimney\nstarted ajar, just like the marble gate of a tomb. Inserting one leg of\nthe heavy tongs in the crack, the Squire pried this cavernous gate wide\nopen.\n\n\"Why, Squire Woodcock, what is the matter with your chimney?\" said\nIsrael.\n\n\"Quick, go in.\"\n\n\"Am I to sweep the chimney?\" demanded Israel; \"I didn't engage for\nthat.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh, this is your hiding-place. Come, move in.\"\n\n\"But where does it go to, Squire Woodcock? I don't like the looks of\nit.\"\n\n\"Follow me. I'll show you.\"\n\nPushing his florid corpulence into the mysterious aperture, the elderly\nSquire led the way up steep stairs of stone, hardly two feet in width,\ntill they reached a little closet, or rather cell, built into the\nmassive main wall of the mansion, and ventilated and dimly lit by two\nlittle sloping slits, ingeniously concealed without, by their forming\nthe sculptured mouths of two griffins cut in a great stone tablet\ndecorating that external part of the dwelling. A mattress lay rolled up\nin one corner, with a jug of water, a flask of wine, and a wooden\ntrencher containing cold roast beef and bread.\n\n\"And I am to be buried alive here?\" said Israel, ruefully looking round.\n\n\"But your resurrection will soon be at hand,\" smiled the Squire; \"two\ndays at the furthest.\"\n\n\"Though to be sure I was a sort of prisoner in Paris, just as I seem\nabout to be made here,\" said Israel, \"yet Doctor Franklin put me in a\nbetter jug than this, Squire Woodcock. It was set out with boquets and a\nmirror, and other fine things. Besides, I could step out into the entry\nwhenever I wanted.\"\n\n\"Ah, but, my hero, that was in France, and this is in England. There you\nwere in a friendly country: here you are in the enemy's. If you should\nbe discovered in my house, and your connection with me became known, do\nyou know that it would go very hard with me; very hard indeed?\"\n\n\"Then, for your sake, I am willing to stay wherever you think best to\nput me,\" replied Israel.\n\n\"Well, then, you say you want boquets and a mirror. If those articles\nwill at all help to solace your seclusion, I will bring them to you.\"\n\n\"They really would be company; the sight of my own face particularly.\"\n\n\"Stay here, then. I will be back in ten minutes.\"\n\nIn less than that time, the good old Squire returned, puffing and\npanting, with a great bunch of flowers, and a small shaving-glass.\n\n\"There,\" said he, putting them down; \"now keep perfectly quiet; avoid\nmaking any undue noise, and on no account descend the stairs, till I\ncome for you again.\"\n\n\"But when will that be?\" asked Israel.\n\n\"I will try to come twice each day while you are here. But there is no\nknowing what may happen. If I should not visit you till I come to\nliberate you--on the evening of the second day, or the morning of the\nthird--you must not be at all surprised, my good fellow. There is plenty\nof food-and water to last you. But mind, on no account descend the\nstone-stairs till I come for you.\"\n\nWith that, bidding his guest adieu, he left him.\n\nIsrael stood glancing pensively around for a time. By and by, moving the\nrolled mattress under the two air-slits, he mounted, to try if aught\nwere visible beyond. But nothing was to be seen but a very thin slice of\nblue sky peeping through the lofty foliage of a great tree planted near\nthe side-portal of the mansion; an ancient tree, coeval with the ancient\ndwelling it guarded.\n\nSitting down on the Mattress, Israel fell into a reverie.\n\n\"Poverty and liberty, or plenty and a prison, seem to be the two horns\nof the constant dilemma of my life,\" thought he. \"Let's look at the\nprisoner.\"\n\nAnd taking up the shaving-glass, he surveyed his lineaments.\n\n\"What a pity I didn't think to ask for razors and soap. I want shaving\nvery badly. I shaved last in France. How it would pass the time here.\nHad I a comb now and a razor, I might shave and curl my hair, and keep\nmaking a continual toilet all through the two days, and look spruce as a\nrobin when I get out. I'll ask the Squire for the things this very night\nwhen he drops in. Hark! ain't that a sort of rumbling in the wall? I\nhope there ain't any oven next door; if so, I shall be scorched out.\nHere I am, just like a rat in the wainscot. I wish there was a low\nwindow to look out of. I wonder what Doctor Franklin is doing now, and\nPaul Jones? Hark! there's a bird singing in the leaves. Bell for dinner,\nthat.\"\n\nAnd for pastime, he applied himself to the beef and bread, and took a\ndraught of the wine and water.\n\nAt last night fell. He was left in utter darkness. No Squire.\n\nAfter an anxious, sleepless night, he saw two long flecks of pale gray\nlight slanting into the cell from the slits, like two long spears. He\nrose, rolled up his mattress, got upon the roll, and put his mouth to\none of the griffins' months. He gave a low, just audible whistle,\ndirecting it towards the foliage of the tree. Presently there was a\nslight rustling among the leaves, then one solitary chirrup, and in\nthree minutes a whole chorus of melody burst upon his ear.\n\n\"I've waked the first bird,\" said he to himself, with a smile, \"and he's\nwaked all the rest. Now then for breakfast. That over, I dare say the\nSquire will drop in.\"\n\nBut the breakfast was over, and the two flecks of pale light had changed\nto golden beams, and the golden beams grew less and less slanting, till\nthey straightened themselves up out of sight altogether. It was noon,\nand no Squire.\n\n\"He's gone a-hunting before breakfast, and got belated,\" thought Israel.\n\nThe afternoon shadows lengthened. It was sunset; no Squire.\n\n\"He must be very busy trying some sheep-stealer in the hall,\" mused\nIsrael. \"I hope he won't forget all about me till to-morrow.\"\n\nHe waited and listened; and listened and waited.\n\nAnother restless night; no sleep; morning came. The second day passed\nlike the first, and the night. On the third morning the flowers lay\nshrunken by his side. Drops of wet oozing through the air-slits, fell\ndully on the stone floor. He heard the dreary beatings of the tree's\nleaves against the mouths of the griffins, bedashing them with the spray\nof the rain-storm without. At intervals a burst of thunder rolled over\nhis head, and lightning flashing down through the slits, lit up the cell\nwith a greenish glare, followed by sharp splashings and rattlings of the\nredoubled rain-storm.\n\n\"This is the morning of the third day,\" murmured Israel to himself; \"he\nsaid he would at the furthest come to me on the morning of the third\nday. This is it. Patience, he will be here yet. Morning lasts till\nnoon.\"\n\nBut, owing to the murkiness of the day, it was very hard to tell when\nnoon came. Israel refused to credit that noon had come and gone, till\ndusk set plainly in. Dreading he knew not what, he found himself buried\nin the darkness of still another night. However patient and hopeful\nhitherto, fortitude now presently left him. Suddenly, as if some\ncontagious fever had seized him, he was afflicted with strange\nenchantments of misery, undreamed of till now.\n\nHe had eaten all the beef, but there was bread and water sufficient to\nlast, by economy, for two or three days to come. It was not the pang of\nhunger then, but a nightmare originating in his mysterious\nincarceration, which appalled him. All through the long hours of this\nparticular night, the sense of being masoned up in the wall, grew, and\ngrew, and grew upon him, till again and again he lifted himself\nconvulsively from the floor, as if vast blocks of stone had been laid on\nhim; as if he had been digging a deep well, and the stonework with all\nthe excavated earth had caved in upon him, where he burrowed ninety feet\nbeneath the clover. In the blind tomb of the midnight he stretched his\ntwo arms sideways, and felt as if coffined at not being able to extend\nthem straight out, on opposite sides, for the narrowness of the cell. He\nseated himself against one side of the wall, crosswise with the cell,\nand pushed with his feet at the opposite wall. But still mindful of his\npromise in this extremity, he uttered no cry. He mutely raved in the\ndarkness. The delirious sense of the absence of light was soon added to\nhis other delirium as to the contraction of space. The lids of his eyes\nburst with impotent distension. Then he thought the air itself was\ngetting unbearable. He stood up at the griffin slits, pressing his lips\nfar into them till he moulded his lips there, to suck the utmost of the\nopen air possible.\n\nAnd continually, to heighten his frenzy, there recurred to him again and\nagain what the Squire had told him as to the origin of the cell. It\nseemed that this part of the old house, or rather this wall of it, was\nextremely ancient, dating far beyond the era of Elizabeth, having once\nformed portion of a religious retreat belonging to the Templars. The\ndomestic discipline of this order was rigid and merciless in the\nextreme. In a side wall of their second storey chapel, horizontal and on\na level with the floor, they had an internal vacancy left, exactly of\nthe shape and average size of a coffin. In this place, from time to\ntime, inmates convicted of contumacy were confined; but, strange to say,\nnot till they were penitent. A small hole, of the girth of one's wrist,\nsunk like a telescope three feet through the masonry into the cell,\nserved at once for ventilation, and to push through food to the\nprisoner. This hole opening into the chapel also enabled the poor\nsolitaire, as intended, to overhear the religious services at the altar;\nand, without being present, take part in the same. It was deemed a good\nsign of the state of the sufferer's soul, if from the gloomy recesses of\nthe wall was heard the agonized groan of his dismal response. This was\nregarded in the light of a penitent wail from the dead, because the\ncustoms of the order ordained that when any inmate should be first\nincarcerated in the wall, he should be committed to it in the presence\nof all the brethren, the chief reading the burial service as the live\nbody was sepulchred. Sometimes several weeks elapsed ere the\ndisentombment, the penitent being then usually found numb and congealed\nin all his extremities, like one newly stricken with paralysis.\n\nThis coffin-cell of the Templars had been suffered to remain in the\ndemolition of the general edifice, to make way for the erection of the\nnew, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It was enlarged somewhat, and\naltered, and additionally ventilated, to adapt it for a place of\nconcealment in times of civil dissension.\n\nWith this history ringing in his solitary brain, it may readily be\nconceived what Israel's feelings must have been. Here, in this very\ndarkness, centuries ago, hearts, human as his, had mildewed in despair;\nlimbs, robust as his own, had stiffened in immovable torpor.\n\nAt length, after what seemed all the prophetic days and years of Daniel,\nmorning broke. The benevolent light entered the cell, soothing his\nfrenzy, as if it had been some smiling human face--nay, the Squire\nhimself, come at last to redeem him from thrall. Soon his dumb ravings\nentirely left him, and gradually, with a sane, calm mind, he revolved\nall the circumstances of his condition.\n\nHe could not be mistaken; something fatal must have befallen his friend.\nIsrael remembered the Squire's hinting that in case of the discovery of\nhis clandestine proceedings it would fare extremely hard with him,\nIsrael was forced to conclude that this same unhappy discovery had been\nmade; that owing to some untoward misadventure his good friend had been\ncarried off a State-prisoner to London; that prior to his going the\nSquire had not apprised any member of his household that he was about to\nleave behind him a prisoner in the wall; this seemed evident from the\ncircumstance that, thus far, no soul had visited that prisoner. It could\nnot be otherwise. Doubtless the Squire, having no opportunity to\nconverse in private with his relatives or friends at the moment of his\nsudden arrest, had been forced to keep his secret, for the present, for\nfear of involving Israel in still worse calamities. But would he leave\nhim to perish piecemeal in the wall? All surmise was baffled in the\nunconjecturable possibilities of the case. But some sort of action must\nspeedily be determined upon. Israel would not additionally endanger the\nSquire, but he could not in such uncertainty consent to perish where he\nwas. He resolved at all hazards to escape, by stealth and noiselessly,\nif possible; by violence and outcry, if indispensable.\n\nGliding out of the cell, he descended the stone stairs, and stood before\nthe interior of the jamb. He felt an immovable iron knob, but no more.\nHe groped about gently for some bolt or spring. When before he had\npassed through the passage with his guide, he had omitted to notice by\nwhat precise mechanism the jamb was to be opened from within, or\nwhether, indeed, it could at all be opened except from without.\n\nHe was about giving up the search in despair, after sweeping with his\ntwo hands every spot of the wall-surface around him, when chancing to\nturn his whole body a little to one side, he heard a creak, and saw a\nthin lance of light. His foot had unconsciously pressed some spring laid\nin the floor. The jamb was ajar. Pushing it open, he stood at liberty,\nin the Squire's closet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nHIS ESCAPE FROM THE HOUSE, WITH VARIOUS ADVENTURES FOLLOWING.\n\n\nHe started at the funereal aspect of the room, into which, since he last\nstood there, undertakers seemed to have stolen. The curtains of the\nwindow were festooned with long weepers of crape. The four corners of\nthe red cloth on the round table were knotted with crape.\n\nKnowing nothing of these mournful customs of the country, nevertheless,\nIsrael's instinct whispered him that Squire Woodcock lived no more on\nthis earth. At once the whole three days' mystery was made clear. But\nwhat was now to be done? His friend must have died very suddenly; most\nprobably struck down in a fit, from which he never more rose. With him\nhad perished all knowledge of the fact that a stranger was immured in\nthe mansion. If discovered then, prowling here in the inmost privacies\nof a gentleman's abode, what would befall the wanderer, already not\nunsuspected in the neighborhood of some underhand guilt as a fugitive?\nIf he adhered to the strict truth, what could he offer in his own\ndefence without convicting himself of acts which, by English tribunals,\nwould be accounted flagitious crimes? Unless, indeed, by involving the\nmemory of the deceased Squire Woodcock in his own self acknowledged\nproceedings, so ungenerous a charge should result in an abhorrent\nrefusal to credit his extraordinary tale, whether as referring to\nhimself or another, and so throw him open to still more grievous\nsuspicions?\n\nWhile wrapped in these dispiriting reveries, he heard a step not very\nfar off in the passage. It seemed approaching. Instantly he flew to the\njamb, which remained unclosed, and disappearing within, drew the stone\nafter him by the iron knob. Owing to his hurried violence the jamb\nclosed with a dull, dismal and singular noise. A shriek followed from\nwithin the room. In a panic, Israel fled up the dark stairs, and near\nthe top, in his eagerness, stumbled and fell back to the last step with\na rolling din, which, reverberated by the arch overhead, smote through\nand through the wall, dying away at last indistinctly, like low muffled\nthunder among the clefts of deep hills. When raising himself instantly,\nnot seriously bruised by his fall, Israel instantly listened, the\nechoing sounds of his descent were mingled with added shrieks from\nwithin the room. They seemed some nervous female's, alarmed by what must\nhave appeared to her supernatural, or at least unaccountable, noises in\nthe wall. Directly he heard other voices of alarm undistinguishably\ncommingled, and then they retreated together, and all again was still.\n\nRecovering from his first amazement, Israel revolved these occurrences.\n\"No creature now in the house knows of the cell,\" thought he. \"Some\nwoman, the housekeeper, perhaps, first entered the room alone. Just as\nshe entered the jamb closed. The sudden report made her shriek; then,\nafterwards, the noise of my fall prolonging itself, added to her fright,\nwhile her repeated shrieks brought every soul in the house to her, who\naghast at seeing her lying in a pale faint, it may be, like a corpse, in\na room hung with crape for a man just dead, they also shrieked out, and\nthen with blended lamentations they bore the fainting person away. Now\nthis will follow; no doubt it _has_ followed ere now:--they believe that\nthe woman saw or heard the spirit of Squire Woodcock. Since I seem then\nto understand how all these strange events have occurred, since I seem\nto know that they have plain common causes, I begin to feel cool and\ncalm again. Let me see. Yes. I have it. By means of the idea of the\nghost prevailing among the frightened household, by that means I will\nthis very night make good my escape. If I can but lay hands on some of\nthe late Squire's clothing, if but a coat and hat of his, I shall be\ncertain to succeed. It is not too early to begin now. They will hardly\ncome back to the room in a hurry. I will return to it and see what I can\nfind to serve my purpose. It is the Squire's private closet, hence it is\nnot unlikely that here some at least of his clothing will be found.\"\n\nWith these, thoughts, he cautiously sprung the iron under foot, peeped\nin, and, seeing all clear, boldly re-entered the apartment. He went\nstraight to a high, narrow door in the opposite wall. The key was in the\nlock. Opening the door, there hung several coats, small-clothes, pairs\nof silk stockings, and hats of the deceased. With little difficulty\nIsrael selected from these the complete suit in which he had last seen\nhis once jovial friend. Carefully closing the door, and carrying the\nsuit with him, he was returning towards the chimney, when he saw the\nSquire's silver-headed cane leaning against a corner of the wainscot.\nTaking this also, he stole back to his cell.\n\nSlipping off his own clothing, he deliberately arrayed himself in the\nborrowed raiment, silk small-clothes and all, then put on the cocked\nhat, grasped the silver-headed cane in his right hand, and moving his\nsmall shaving-glass slowly up and down before him, so as by piecemeal to\ntake in his whole figure, felt convinced that he would well pass for\nSquire Woodcock's genuine phantom. But after the first feeling of\nself-satisfaction with his anticipated success had left him, it was not\nwithout some superstitious embarrassment that Israel felt himself\nencased in a dead man's broadcloth; nay, in the very coat in which the\ndeceased had no doubt fallen down in his fit. By degrees he began to\nfeel almost as unreal and shadowy as the shade whose part he intended to\nenact.\n\nWaiting long and anxiously till darkness came, and then till he thought\nit was fairly midnight, he stole back into the closet, and standing for\na moment uneasily in the middle of the floor, thinking over all the\nrisks he might run, he lingered till he felt himself resolute and calm.\nThen groping for the door leading into the hall, put his hand on the\nknob and turned it. But the door refused to budge. Was it locked? The\nkey was not in. Turning the knob once more, and holding it so, he\npressed firmly against the door. It did not move. More firmly still,\nwhen suddenly it burst open with a loud crackling report. Being cramped,\nit had stuck in the sill. Less than three seconds passed when, as Israel\nwas groping his way down the long wide hall towards the large staircase\nat its opposite end, he heard confused hurrying noises from the\nneighboring rooms, and in another instant several persons, mostly in\nnight-dresses, appeared at their chamber-doors, thrusting out alarmed\nfaces, lit by a lamp held by one of the number, a rather elderly lady in\nwidow's weeds, who by her appearance seemed to have just risen from a\nsleepless chair, instead of an oblivious couch. Israel's heart beat like\na hammer; his face turned like a sheet. But bracing himself, pulling his\nhat lower down over his eyes, settling his head in the collar of his\ncoat, he advanced along the defile of wildly staring faces. He advanced\nwith a slow and stately step, looked neither to the right nor the left,\nbut went solemnly forward on his now faintly illuminated way, sounding\nhis cane on the floor as he passed. The faces in the doorways curdled\nhis blood by their rooted looks. Glued to the spot, they seemed\nincapable of motion. Each one was silent as he advanced towards him or\nher, but as he left each individual, one after another, behind, each in\na frenzy shrieked out, \"The Squire, the Squire!\" As he passed the lady\nin the widow's weeds, she fell senseless and crosswise before him. But\nforced to be immutable in his purpose, Israel, solemnly stepping over\nher prostrate form, marched deliberately on.\n\nIn a few minutes more he had reached the main door of the mansion, and\nwithdrawing the chain and bolt, stood in the open air. It was a bright\nmoonlight night. He struck slowly across the open grounds towards the\nsunken fields beyond. When-midway across the grounds, he turned towards\nthe mansion, and saw three of the front windows filled with white faces,\ngazing in terror at the wonderful spectre. Soon descending a slope, he\ndisappeared from their view.\n\nPresently he came to hilly land in meadow, whose grass having been\nlately cut, now lay dotting the slope in cocks; a sinuous line of creamy\nvapor meandered through the lowlands at the base of the hill; while\nbeyond was a dense grove of dwarfish trees, with here and there a tall\ntapering dead trunk, peeled of the bark, and overpeering the rest. The\nvapor wore the semblance of a deep stream of water, imperfectly\ndescried; the grove looked like some closely-clustering town on its\nbanks, lorded over by spires of churches.\n\nThe whole scene magically reproduced to our adventurer the aspect of\nBunker Hill, Charles River, and Boston town, on the well-remembered\nnight of the 16th of June. The same season; the same moon; the same\nnew-mown hay on the shaven sward; hay which was scraped together during\nthe night to help pack into the redoubt so hurriedly thrown up.\n\nActed on as if by enchantment, Israel sat down on one of the cocks, and\ngave himself up to reverie. But, worn out by long loss of sleep, his\nreveries would have soon merged into slumber's still wilder dreams, had\nhe not rallied himself, and departed on his way, fearful of forgetting\nhimself in an emergency like the present. It now occurred to him that,\nwell as his disguise had served him in escaping from the mansion of\nSquire Woodcock, that disguise might fatally endanger him if he should\nbe discovered in it abroad. He might pass for a ghost at night, and\namong the relations and immediate friends of the gentleman deceased; but\nby day, and among indifferent persons, he ran no small risk of being\napprehended for an entry-thief. He bitterly lamented his omission in not\npulling on the Squire's clothes over his own, so that he might now have\nreappeared in his former guise.\n\nAs meditating over this difficulty, he was passing along, suddenly he\nsaw a man in black standing right in his path, about fifty yards\ndistant, in a field of some growing barley or wheat. The gloomy stranger\nwas standing stock-still; one outstretched arm, with weird intimation\npointing towards the deceased Squire's abode. To the brooding soul of\nthe now desolate Israel, so strange a sight roused a supernatural\nsuspicion. His conscience morbidly reproaching him for the terrors he\nhad bred in making his escape from the house, he seemed to see in the\nfixed gesture of the stranger something more than humanly significant.\nBut somewhat of his intrepidity returned; he resolved to test the\napparition. Composing itself to the same deliberate stateliness with\nwhich it had paced the hall, the phantom of Squire Woodcock firmly,\nadvanced its cane, and marched straight forward towards the mysterious\nstranger.\n\nAs he neared him, Israel shrunk. The dark coat-sleeve flapped on the\nbony skeleton of the unknown arm. The face was lost in a sort of ghastly\nblank. It was no living man.\n\nBut mechanically continuing his course, Israel drew still nearer and saw\na scarecrow.\n\nNot a little relieved by the discovery, our adventurer paused, more\nparticularly to survey so deceptive an object, which seemed to have been\nconstructed on the most efficient principles; probably by some broken\ndown wax figure costumer. It comprised the complete wardrobe of a\nscarecrow, namely: a cocked hat, bunged; tattered coat; old velveteen\nbreeches; and long worsted stockings, full of holes; all stuffed very\nnicely with straw, and skeletoned by a frame-work of poles. There was a\ngreat flapped pocket to the coat--which seemed to have been some\nlaborer's--standing invitingly opened. Putting his hands in, Israel drew\nout the lid of an old tobacco-box, the broken bowl of a pipe, two rusty\nnails, and a few kernels of wheat. This reminded him of the Squire's\npockets. Trying them, he produced a handsome handkerchief, a\nspectacle-case, with a purse containing some silver and gold, amounting\nto a little more than five pounds. Such is the difference between the\ncontents of the pockets of scarecrows and the pockets of well-to-do\nsquires. Ere donning his present habiliments, Israel had not omitted to\nwithdraw his own money from his own coat, and put it in the pocket of\nhis own waistcoat, which he had not exchanged.\n\nLooking upon the scarecrow more attentively, it struck him that,\nmiserable as its wardrobe was, nevertheless here was a chance for\ngetting rid of the unsuitable and perilous clothes of the Squire. No\nother available opportunity might present itself for a time. Before he\nencountered any living creature by daylight, another suit must somehow\nbe had. His exchange with the old ditcher, after his escape from the inn\nnear Portsmouth, had familiarized him with the most deplorable of\nwardrobes. Well, too, he knew, and had experienced it, that for a man\ndesirous of avoiding notice, the more wretched the clothes, the better.\nFor who does not shun the scurvy wretch, Poverty, advancing in battered\nhat and lamentable coat?\n\nWithout more ado, slipping off the Squire's raiment, he donned the\nscarecrow's, after carefully shaking out the hay, which, from many\nalternate soakings and bakings in rain and sun, had become quite broken\nup, and would have been almost dust, were it not for the mildew which\ndamped it. But sufficient of this wretched old hay remained adhesive to\nthe inside of the breeches and coat-sleeves, to produce the most\nirritating torment.\n\nThe grand moral question now came up, what to do with the purse. Would\nit be dishonest under the circumstances to appropriate that purse?\nConsidering the whole matter, and not forgetting that he had not\nreceived from the gentleman deceased the promised reward for his\nservices as courier, Israel concluded that he might justly use the\nmoney for his own. To which opinion surely no charitable judge will\ndemur. Besides, what should he do with the purse, if not use it for his\nown? It would have been insane to have returned it to the relations.\nSuch mysterious honesty would have but resulted in his arrest as a\nrebel, or rascal. As for the Squire's clothes, handkerchief, and\nspectacle-case, they must be put out of sight with all dispatch. So,\ngoing to a morass not remote, Israel sunk them deep down, and heaped\ntufts of the rank sod upon them. Then returning to the field of corn,\nsat down under the lee of a rock, about a hundred yards from where the\nscarecrow had stood, thinking which way he now had best direct his\nsteps. But his late ramble coming after so long a deprivation of rest,\nsoon produced effects not so easy to be shaken off, as when reposing\nupon the haycock. He felt less anxious too, since changing his apparel.\nSo before he was aware, he fell into deep sleep.\n\nWhen he awoke, the sun was well up in the sky. Looking around he saw a\nfarm-laborer with a pitchfork coming at a distance into view, whose\nsteps seemed bent in a direction not far from the spot where he lay.\nImmediately it struck our adventurer that this man must be familiar with\nthe scarecrow; perhaps had himself fashioned it. Should he miss it then,\nhe might make immediate search, and so discover the thief so imprudently\nloitering upon the very field of his operations.\n\nWaiting until the man momentarily disappeared in a little hollow, Israel\nran briskly to the identical spot where the scarecrow had stood, where,\nstanding stiffly erect, pulling the hat well over his face, and\nthrusting out his arm, pointed steadfastly towards the Squire's abode,\nhe awaited the event. Soon the man reappeared in sight, and marching\nright on, paused not far from Israel, and gave him an one earnest look,\nas if it were his daily wont to satisfy that all was right with the\nscarecrow. No sooner was the man departed to a reasonable distance,\nthan, quitting his post, Israel struck across the fields towards London.\nBut he had not yet quite quitted the field when it occurred to him to\nturn round and see if the man was completely out of sight, when, to his\nconsternation, he saw the man returning towards him, evidently by his\npace and gesture in unmixed amazement. The man must have turned round to\nlook before Israel had done so. Frozen to the ground, Israel knew not\nwhat to do; but next moment it struck him that this very motionlessness\nwas the least hazardous plan in such a strait. Thrusting out his arm\nagain towards the house, once more he stood stock still, and again\nawaited the event.\n\nIt so happened that this time, in pointing towards the house, Israel\nunavoidably pointed towards the advancing man. Hoping that the\nstrangeness of this coincidence might, by operating on the man's\nsuperstition, incline him to beat an immediate retreat, Israel kept cool\nas he might. But the man proved to be of a braver metal than\nanticipated. In passing the spot where the scarecrow had stood, and\nperceiving, beyond the possibility of mistake, that by, some\nunaccountable agency it had suddenly removed itself to a distance,\ninstead of being, terrified at this verification of his worst\napprehensions, the man pushed on for Israel, apparently resolved to sift\nthis mystery to the bottom.\n\nSeeing him now determinately coming, with pitchfork valiantly presented,\nIsrael, as a last means of practising on the fellow's fears of the\nsupernatural, suddenly doubled up both fists, presenting them savagely\ntowards him at a distance of about twenty paces, at the same time\nshowing his teeth like a skull's, and demoniacally rolling his eyes. The\nman paused bewildered, looked all round him, looked at the springing\ngrain, then across at some trees, then up at the sky, and satisfied at\nlast by those observations that the world at large had not undergone a\nmiracle in the last fifteen minutes, resolutely resumed his advance; the\npitchfork, like a boarding-pike, now aimed full at the breast of the\nobject. Seeing all his stratagems vain, Israel now threw himself into\nthe original attitude of the scarecrow, and once again stood immovable.\nAbating his pace by degrees almost to a mere creep, the man at last came\nwithin three feet of him, and, pausing, gazed amazed into Israel's eyes.\nWith a stern and terrible expression Israel resolutely returned the\nglance, but otherwise remained like a statue, hoping thus to stare his\npursuer out of countenance. At last the man slowly presented one prong\nof his fork towards Israel's left eye. Nearer and nearer the sharp point\ncame, till no longer capable of enduring such a test, Israel took to his\nheels with all speed, his tattered coat-tails streaming behind him. With\ninveterate purpose the man pursued. Darting blindly on, Israel, leaping\na gate, suddenly found himself in a field where some dozen laborers\nwere at work, who recognizing the scarecrow--an old acquaintance of\ntheirs, as it would seem--lifted all their hands as the astounding\napparition swept by, followed by the man with the pitchfork. Soon all\njoined in the chase, but Israel proved to have better wind and bottom\nthan any. Outstripping the whole pack he finally shot out of their sight\nin an extensive park, heavily timbered in one quarter. He never saw more\nof these people.\n\nLoitering in the wood till nightfall, he then stole out and made the\nbest of his way towards the house of that good natured farmer in whose\ncorn-loft he had received his first message from Squire Woodcock.\nRousing this man up a little before midnight, he informed him somewhat\nof his recent adventures, but carefully concealed his having been\nemployed as a secret courier, together with his escape from Squire\nWoodcock's. All he craved at present was a meal. The meal being over,\nIsrael offered to buy from the farmer his best suit of clothes, and\ndisplayed the money on the spot.\n\n\"Where did you get so much money?\" said his entertainer in a tone of\nsurprise; \"your clothes here don't look as if you had seen prosperous\ntimes since you left me. Why, you look like a scarecrow.\"\n\n\"That may well be,\" replied Israel, very soberly. \"But what do you say?\nwill you sell me your suit?--here's the cash.\"\n\n\"I don't know about it,\" said the farmer, in doubt; \"let me look at the\nmoney. Ha!--a silk purse come out of a beggars pocket!--Quit the house,\nrascal, you've turned thief.\"\n\nThinking that he could not swear to his having come by his money with\nabsolute honesty--since indeed the case was one for the most subtle\ncasuist--Israel knew not what to reply. This honest confusion confirmed\nthe farmer, who with many abusive epithets drove him into the road,\ntelling him that he might thank himself that he did not arrest him on\nthe spot.\n\nIn great dolor at this unhappy repulse, Israel trudged on in the\nmoonlight some three miles to the house of another friend, who also had\nonce succored him in extremity. This man proved a very sound sleeper.\nInstead of succeeding in rousing him by his knocking, Israel but\nsucceeded in rousing his wife, a person not of the greatest amiability.\nRaising the sash, and seeing so shocking a pauper before her, the woman\nupbraided him with shameless impropriety in asking charity at dead of\nnight, in a dress so improper too. Looking down at his deplorable\nvelveteens, Israel discovered that his extensive travels had produced a\ngreat rent in one loin of the rotten old breeches, through which a\nwhitish fragment protruded.\n\nRemedying this oversight as well as he might, he again implored the\nwoman to wake her husband.\n\n\"That I shan't!\" said the woman, morosely. \"Quit the premises, or I'll\nthrow something on ye.\"\n\nWith that she brought some earthenware to the window, and would have\nfulfilled her threat, had not Israel prudently retreated some paces.\nHere he entreated the woman to take mercy on his plight, and since she\nwould not waken her husband, at least throw to him (Israel) her\nhusband's breeches, and he would leave the price of them, with his own\nbreeches to boot, on the sill of the door.\n\n\"You behold how sadly I need them,\" said he; \"for heaven's sake befriend\nme.\"\n\n\"Quit the premises!\" reiterated the woman.\n\n\"The breeches, the breeches! here is the money,\" cried Israel, half\nfurious with anxiety.\n\n\"Saucy cur,\" cried the woman, somehow misunderstanding him; \"do you\ncunningly taunt me with _wearing_ the breeches'? begone!\"\n\nOnce more poor Israel decamped, and made for another friend. But here a\nmonstrous bull-dog, indignant that the peace of a quiet family should be\ndisturbed by so outrageous a tatterdemalion, flew at Israel's\nunfortunate coat, whose rotten skirts the brute tore completely off,\nleaving the coat razeed to a spencer, which barely came down to the\nwearer's waist. In attempting to drive the monster away, Israel's hat\nfell off, upon which the dog pounced with the utmost fierceness, and\nthrusting both paws into it, rammed out the crown and went snuffling the\nwreck before him. Recovering the wretched hat, Israel again beat a\nretreat, his wardrobe sorely the worse for his visits. Not only was his\ncoat a mere rag, but his breeches, clawed by the dog, were slashed into\nyawning gaps, while his yellow hair waved over the top of the crownless\nbeaver, like a lonely tuft of heather on the highlands.\n\nIn this plight the morning discovered him dubiously skirmishing on the\noutskirts of a village.\n\n\"Ah! what a true patriot gets for serving his country!\" murmured\nIsrael. But soon thinking a little better of his case, and seeing yet\nanother house which had once furnished him with an asylum, he made bold\nto advance to the door. Luckily he this time met the man himself, just\nemerging from bed. At first the farmer did not recognize the fugitive,\nbut upon another look, seconded by Israel's plaintive appeal, beckoned\nhim into the barn, where directly our adventurer told him all he thought\nprudent to disclose of his story, ending by once more offering to\nnegotiate for breeches and coat. Having ere this emptied and thrown away\nthe purse which had played him so scurvy a trick with the first farmer,\nhe now produced three crown-pieces.\n\n\"Three crown-pieces in your pocket, and no crown to your hat!\" said the\nfarmer.\n\n\"But I assure you, my friend,\" rejoined Israel, \"that a finer hat was\nnever worn, until that confounded bull-dog ruined it.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the farmer, \"I forgot that part of your story. Well, I have\na tolerable coat and breeches which I will sell you for your money.\"\n\nIn ten minutes more Israel was equipped in a gray coat of coarse cloth,\nnot much improved by wear, and breeches to match. For half-a-crown more\nhe procured a highly respectable looking hat.\n\n\"Now, my kind friend,\" said Israel, \"can you tell me where Horne Tooke\nand John Bridges live?\"\n\nOur adventurer thought it his best plan to seek out one or other of\nthose gentlemen, both to report proceedings and learn confirmatory\ntidings concerning Squire Woodcock, touching whose fate he did not like\nto inquire of others.\n\n\"Horne Tooke? What do you want with Horne Tooke,\" said the farmer. \"He\nwas Squire Woodcock's friend, wasn't he? The poor Squire! Who would have\nthought he'd have gone off so suddenly. But apoplexy comes like a\nbullet.\"\n\n\"I was right,\" thought Israel to himself. \"But where does Horne Tooke\nlive?\" he demanded again.\n\n\"He once lived in Brentford, and wore a cassock there. But I hear he's\nsold out his living, and gone in his surplice to study law in Lunnon.\"\n\nThis was all news to Israel, who, from various amiable remarks he had\nheard from Horne Tooke at the Squire's, little dreamed he was an\nordained clergyman. Yet a good-natured English clergyman translated\nLucian; another, equally good-natured, wrote Tristam Shandy; and a\nthird, an ill-natured appreciator of good-natured Rabelais, died a dean;\nnot to speak of others. Thus ingenious and ingenuous are some of the\nEnglish clergy.\n\n\"You can't tell me, then, where to find Horne Tooke?\" said Israel, in\nperplexity.\n\n\"You'll find him, I suppose, in Lunnon.\"\n\n\"What street and number?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Needle in a haystack.\"\n\n\"Where does Mr. Bridges live?\"\n\n\"Never heard of any Bridges, except Lunnon bridges, and one Molly\nBridges in Bridewell.\"\n\nSo Israel departed; better clothed, but no wiser than before.\n\nWhat to do next? He reckoned up his money, and concluded he had plenty\nto carry him back to Doctor Franklin in Paris. Accordingly, taking a\nturn to avoid the two nearest villages, he directed his steps towards\nLondon, where, again taking the post-coach for Dover, he arrived on the\nchannel shore just in time to learn that the very coach in which he rode\nbrought the news to the authorities there that all intercourse between\nthe two nations was indefinitely suspended. The characteristic\ntaciturnity and formal stolidity of his fellow-travellers--all\nEnglishmen, mutually unacquainted with each other, and occupying\ndifferent positions in life--having prevented his sooner hearing the\ntidings.\n\nHere was another accumulation of misfortunes. All visions but those of\neventual imprisonment or starvation vanished from before the present\nrealities of poor Israel Potter. The Brentford gentleman had flattered\nhim with the prospect of receiving something very handsome for his\nservices as courier. That hope was no more. Doctor Franklin had promised\nhim his good offices in procuring him a passage home to America. Quite\nout of the question now. The sage had likewise intimated that he might\npossibly see him some way remunerated for his sufferings in his\ncountry's cause. An idea no longer to be harbored. Then Israel recalled\nthe mild man of wisdom's words--\"At the prospect of pleasure never be\nelated; but without depression respect the omens of ill.\" But he found\nit as difficult now to comply, in all respects, with the last section of\nthe maxim, as before he had with the first.\n\nWhile standing wrapped in afflictive reflections on the shore, gazing\ntowards the unattainable coast of France, a pleasant-looking cousinly\nstranger, in seamen's dress, accosted him, and, after some pleasant\nconversation, very civilly invited him up a lane into a house of rather\nsecret entertainment. Pleased to be befriended in this his strait,\nIsrael yet looked inquisitively upon the man, not completely satisfied\nwith his good intentions. But the other, with good-humored violence,\nhurried him up the lane into the inn, when, calling for some spirits, he\nand Israel very affectionately drank to each other's better health and\nprosperity.\n\n\"Take another glass,\" said the stranger, affably.\n\nIsrael, to drown his heavy-heartedness, complied. The liquor began to\ntake effect.\n\n\"Ever at sea?\" said the stranger, lightly.\n\n\"Oh, yes; been a whaling.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the other, \"happy to hear that, I assure you. Jim! Bill!\" And\nbeckoning very quietly to two brawny fellows, in a trice Israel found\nhimself kidnapped into the naval service of the magnanimous old\ngentleman of Kew Gardens--his Royal Majesty, George III.\n\n\"Hands off!\" said Israel, fiercely, as the two men pinioned him.\n\n\"Reglar game-cock,\" said the cousinly-looking man. \"I must get three\nguineas for cribbing him. Pleasant voyage to ye, my friend,\" and,\nleaving Israel a prisoner, the crimp, buttoning his coat, sauntered\nleisurely out of the inn.\n\n\"I'm no Englishman,\" roared Israel, in a foam.\n\n\"Oh! that's the old story,\" grinned his jailers. \"Come along. There's\nno Englishman in the English fleet. All foreigners. You may take their\nown word for it.\"\n\nTo be short, in less than a week Israel found himself at Portsmouth,\nand, ere long, a foretopman in his Majesty's ship of the line,\n\"Unprincipled,\" scudding before the wind down channel, in company with\nthe \"Undaunted,\" and the \"Unconquerable;\" all three haughty Dons bound\nto the East Indian waters as reinforcements to the fleet of Sir Edward\nHughs.\n\nAnd now, we might shortly have to record our adventurer's part in the\nfamous engagement off the coast of Coromandel, between Admiral\nSuffrien's fleet and the English squadron, were it not that fate\nsnatched him on the threshold of events, and, turning him short round\nwhither he had come, sent him back congenially to war against England;\ninstead of on her behalf. Thus repeatedly and rapidly were the fortunes\nof our wanderer planted, torn up, transplanted, and dropped again,\nhither and thither, according as the Supreme Disposer of sailors and\nsoldiers saw fit to appoint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nIN WHICH ISRAEL IS SAILOR UNDER TWO FLAGS, AND IN THREE SHIPS, AND ALL\nIN ONE NIGHT.\n\n\nAs running down channel at evening, Israel walked the crowded main-deck\nof the seventy-four, continually brushed by a thousand hurrying\nwayfarers, as if he were in some great street in London, jammed with\nartisans, just returning from their day's labor, novel and painful\nemotions were his. He found himself dropped into the naval mob without\none friend; nay, among enemies, since his country's enemies were his\nown, and against the kith and kin of these very beings around him, he\nhimself had once lifted a fatal hand. The martial bustle of a great\nman-of-war, on her first day out of port, was indescribably jarring to\nhis present mood. Those sounds of the human multitude disturbing the\nsolemn natural solitudes of the sea, mysteriously afflicted him. He\nmurmured against that untowardness which, after condemning him to long\nsorrows on the land, now pursued him with added griefs on the deep. Why\nshould a patriot, leaping for the chance again to attack the oppressor,\nas at Bunker Hill, now be kidnapped to fight that oppressor's battles\non the endless drifts of the Bunker Hills of the billows? But like many\nother repiners, Israel was perhaps a little premature with upbraidings\nlike these.\n\nPlying on between Scilly and Cape Clear, the Unprincipled--which vessel\nsomewhat outsailed her consorts--fell in, just before dusk, with a large\nrevenue cutter close to, and showing signals of distress. At the moment,\nno other sail was in sight.\n\nCursing the necessity of pausing with a strong fair wind at a juncture\nlike this, the officer-of-the-deck shortened sail, and hove to; hailing\nthe cutter, to know what was the matter. As he hailed the small craft\nfrom the lofty poop of the bristling seventy-four, this lieutenant\nseemed standing on the top of Gibraltar, talking to some lowland peasant\nin a hut. The reply was, that in a sudden flaw of wind, which came nigh\ncapsizing them, not an hour since, the cutter had lost all four foremost\nmen by the violent jibing of a boom. She wanted help to get back to\nport.\n\n\"You shall have one man,\" said the officer-of-the-deck, morosely.\n\n\"Let him be a good one then, for heaven's sake,\" said he in the cutter;\n\"I ought to have at least two.\"\n\nDuring this talk, Israel's curiosity had prompted him to dart up the\nladder from the main-deck, and stand right in the gangway above, looking\nout on the strange craft. Meantime the order had been given to drop a\nboat. Thinking this a favorable chance, he stationed himself so that he\nshould be the foremost to spring into the boat; though crowds of English\nsailors, eager as himself for the same opportunity to escape from\nforeign service, clung to the chains of the as yet imperfectly\ndisciplined man-of-war. As the two men who had been lowered in the boat\nhooked her, when afloat, along to the gangway, Israel dropped like a\ncomet into the stern-sheets, stumbled forward, and seized an oar. In a\nmoment more, all the oarsmen were in their places, and with a few\nstrokes the boat lay alongside the cutter.\n\n\"Take which of them you please,\" said the lieutenant in command,\naddressing the officer in the revenue-cutter, and motioning with his\nhand to his boat's crew, as if they were a parcel of carcasses of\nmutton, of which the first pick was offered to some customer. \"Quick and\nchoose. Sit down, men\"--to the sailors. \"Oh, you are in a great hurry to\nget rid of the king's service, ain't you? Brave chaps indeed!--Have you\nchosen your man?\"\n\nAll this while the ten faces of the anxious oarsmen looked with mute\nlongings and appealings towards the officer of the cutter; every face\nturned at the same angle, as if managed by one machine. And so they\nwere. One motive.\n\n\"I take the freckled chap with the yellow hair--him,\" pointing to\nIsrael.\n\nNine of the upturned faces fell in sullen despair, and ere Israel could\nspring to his feet, he felt a violent thrust in his rear from the toes\nof one of the disappointed behind him.\n\n\"Jump, dobbin!\" cried the officer of the boat.\n\nBut Israel was already on board. Another moment, and the boat and cutter\nparted. Ere long, night fell, and the man-of-war and her consorts were\nout of sight.\n\nThe revenue vessel resumed her course towards the nighest port, worked\nby but four men: the captain, Israel, and two officers. The cabin-boy\nwas kept at the helm. As the only foremast man, Israel was put to it\npretty hard. Where there is but one man to three masters, woe betide\nthat lonely slave. Besides, it was of itself severe work enough to\nmanage the vessel thus short of hands. But to make matters still worse,\nthe captain and his officers were ugly-tempered fellows. The one kicked,\nand the others cuffed Israel. Whereupon, not sugared with his recent\nexperiences, and maddened by his present hap, Israel seeing himself\nalone at sea, with only three men, instead of a thousand, to contend\nagainst, plucked up a heart, knocked the captain into the lee scuppers,\nand in his fury was about tumbling the first-officer, a small wash of a\nfellow, plump overboard, when the captain, jumping to his feet, seized\nhim by his long yellow hair, vowing he would slaughter him. Meanwhile\nthe cutter flew foaming through the channel, as if in demoniac glee at\nthis uproar on her imperilled deck. While the consternation was at its\nheight, a dark body suddenly loomed at a moderate distance into view,\nshooting right athwart the stern of the cutter. The next moment a shot\nstruck the water within a boat's length.\n\n\"Heave to, and send a boat on board!\" roared a voice almost as loud as\nthe cannon.\n\n\"That's a war-ship,\" cried the captain of the revenue vessel, in alarm;\n\"but she ain't a countryman.\"\n\nMeantime the officers and Israel stopped the cutter's way.\n\n\"Send a boat on board, or I'll sink you,\" again came roaring from the\nstranger, followed by another shot, striking the water still nearer the\ncutter.\n\n\"For God's sake, don't cannonade us. I haven't got the crew to man a\nboat,\" replied the captain of the cutter. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Wait till I send a boat to you for that,\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"She's an enemy of some sort, that's plain,\" said the Englishman now to\nhis officers; \"we ain't at open war with France; she's some bloodthirsty\npirate or other. What d'ye say, men?\" turning to his officers; \"let's\noutsail her, or be shot to chips. We can beat her at sailing, I know.\"\n\nWith that, nothing doubting that his counsel would be heartily responded\nto, he ran to the braces to get the cutter before the wind, followed by\none officer, while the other, for a useless bravado, hoisted the colors\nat the stern.\n\nBut Israel stood indifferent, or rather all in a fever of conflicting\nemotions. He thought he recognized the voice from the strange vessel.\n\n\"Come, what do ye standing there, fool? Spring to the ropes here!\" cried\nthe furious captain.\n\nBut Israel did not stir.\n\nMeantime the confusion on board the stranger, owing to the hurried\nlowering of her boat, with the cloudiness of the sky darkening the misty\nsea, united to conceal the bold manoeuvre of the cutter. She had almost\ngained full headway ere an oblique shot, directed by mere chance, struck\nher stern, tearing the upcurved head of the tiller in the hands of the\ncabin-boy, and killing him with the splinters. Running to the stump, the\ncaptain huzzaed, and steered the reeling ship on. Forced now to hoist\nback the boat ere giving chase, the stranger was dropped rapidly astern.\n\nAll this while storms of maledictions were hurled on Israel. But their\nexertions at the ropes prevented his shipmates for the time from using\npersonal violence. While observing their efforts, Israel could not but\nsay to himself, \"These fellows are as brave as they are brutal.\"\n\nSoon the stranger was seen dimly wallowing along astern, crowding all\nsail in chase, while now and then her bow-gun, showing its red tongue,\nbellowed after them like a mad bull. Two more shots struck the cutter,\nbut without materially damaging her sails, or the ropes immediately\nupholding them. Several of her less important stays were sundered,\nhowever, whose loose tarry ends lashed the air like scorpions. It seemed\nnot improbable that, owing to her superior sailing, the keen cutter\nwould yet get clear.\n\nAt this juncture Israel, running towards the captain, who still held the\nsplintered stump of the tiller, stood full before him, saying, \"I am an\nenemy, a Yankee, look to yourself.\"\n\n\"Help here, lads, help,\" roared the captain, \"a traitor, a traitor!\"\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when his voice was silenced for\never. With one prodigious heave of his whole physical force, Israel\nsmote him over the taffrail into the sea, as if the man had fallen\nbackwards over a teetering chair. By this time the two officers were\nhurrying aft. Ere meeting them midway, Israel, quick as lightning, cast\noff the two principal halyards, thus letting the large sails all in a\ntumble of canvass to the deck. Next moment one of the officers was at\nthe helm, to prevent the cutter from capsizing by being without a\nsteersman in such an emergency. The other officer and Israel\ninterlocked. The battle was in the midst of the chaos of blowing\ncanvass. Caught in a rent of the sail, the officer slipped and fell near\nthe sharp iron edge of the hatchway. As he fell he caught Israel by the\nmost terrible part in which mortality can be grappled. Insane with pain,\nIsrael dashed his adversary's skull against the sharp iron. The\nofficer's hold relaxed, but himself stiffened. Israel made for the\nhelmsman, who as yet knew not the issue of the late tussle. He caught\nhim round the loins, bedding his fingers like grisly claws into his\nflesh, and hugging him to his heart. The man's ghost, caught like a\nbroken cork in a gurgling bottle's neck, gasped with the embrace.\nLoosening him suddenly, Israel hurled him from him against the bulwarks.\nThat instant another report was heard, followed by the savage hail--\"You\ndown sail at last, do ye? I'm a good mind to sink ye for your scurvy\ntrick. Pull down that dirty rag there, astern!\"\n\nWith a loud huzza, Israel hauled down the flag with one hand, while with\nthe other he helped the now slowly gliding craft from falling off before\nthe wind.\n\nIn a few moments a boat was alongside. As its commander stepped to the\ndeck he stumbled against the body of the first officer, which, owing to\nthe sudden slant of the cutter in coming to the wind, had rolled against\nthe side near the gangway. As he came aft he heard the moan of the other\nofficer, where he lay under the mizzen shrouds.\n\n\"What is all this?\" demanded the stranger of Israel.\n\n\"It means that I am a Yankee impressed into the king's service, and for\ntheir pains I have taken the cutter.\"\n\nGiving vent to his surprise, the officer looked narrowly at the body by\nthe shrouds, and said, \"This man is as good as dead, but we will take\nhim to Captain Paul as a witness in your behalf.\"\n\n\"Captain Paul?--Paul Jones?\" cried Israel.\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"I thought so. I thought that was his voice hailing. It was Captain\nPaul's voice that somehow put me up to this deed.\"\n\n\"Captain Paul is the devil for putting men up to be tigers. But where\nare the rest of the crew?\"\n\n\"Overboard.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried the officer; \"come on board the Ranger. Captain Paul will\nuse you for a broadside.\"\n\nTaking the moaning man along with them, and leaving the cutter\nuntenanted by any living soul, the boat now left her for the enemy's\nship. But ere they reached it the man had expired.\n\nStanding foremost on the deck, crowded with three hundred men, as Israel\nclimbed the side, he saw, by the light of battle-lanterns, a small,\nsmart, brigandish-looking man, wearing a Scotch bonnet, with a gold band\nto it.\n\n\"You rascal,\" said this person, \"why did your paltry smack give me this\nchase? Where's the rest of your gang?\"\n\n\"Captain Paul,\" said Israel, \"I believe I remember you. I believe I\noffered you my bed in Paris some months ago. How is Poor Richard?\"\n\n\"God! Is this the courier? The Yankee courier? But how now? in an\nEnglish revenue cutter?\"\n\n\"Impressed, sir; that's the way.\"\n\n\"But where's the rest of them?\" demanded Paul, turning to the officer.\n\nThereupon the officer very briefly told Paul what Israel told him.\n\n\"Are we to sink the cutter, sir?\" said the gunner, now advancing towards\nCaptain Paul. \"If it is to be done, now is the time. She is close under\nus, astern; a few guns pointed downwards will settle her like a shotted\ncorpse.\"\n\n\"No. Let her drift into Penzance, an anonymous earnest of what the\nwhitesquall in Paul Jones intends for the future.\"\n\nThen giving directions as to the course of the ship, with an order for\nhimself to be called at the first glimpse of a sail, Paul took Israel\ndown with him into his cabin.\n\n\"Tell me your story now, my yellow lion. How was it all? Don't stand,\nsit right down there on the transom. I'm a democratic sort of sea-king.\nPlump on the woolsack, I say, and spin the yarn. But hold; you want some\ngrog first.\"\n\nAs Paul handed the flagon, Israel's eye fell upon his hand.\n\n\"You don't wear any rings now, Captain, I see. Left them in Paris for\nsafety.\"\n\n\"Aye, with a certain marchioness there,\" replied Paul, with a dandyish\nlook of sentimental conceit, which sat strangely enough on his otherwise\ngrim and Fejee air.\n\n\"I should think rings would be somewhat inconvenient at sea,\" resumed\nIsrael. \"On my first voyage to the West Indies, I wore a girl's ring on\nmy middle finger here, and it wasn't long before, what with hauling wet\nropes, and what not, it got a kind of grown down into the flesh, and\npained me very bad, let me tell you, it hugged the finger so.\"\n\n\"And did the girl grow as close to your heart, lad?\"\n\n\"Ah, Captain, girls grow themselves off quicker than we grow them on.\"\n\n\"Some experience with the countesses as well as myself, eh? But the\nstory; wave your yellow mane, my lion--the story.\"\n\nSo Israel went on and told the story in all particulars.\n\nAt its conclusion Captain Paul eyed him very earnestly. His wild, lonely\nheart, incapable of sympathizing with cuddled natures made humdrum by\nlong exemption from pain, was yet drawn towards a being, who in\ndesperation of friendlessness, something like his own, had so fiercely\nwaged battle against tyrannical odds.\n\n\"Did you go to sea young, lad?\"\n\n\"Yes, pretty young.\"\n\n\"I went at twelve, from Whitehaven. Only so high,\" raising his hand some\nfour feet from the deck. \"I was so small, and looked so queer in my\nlittle blue jacket, that they called me the monkey. They'll call me\nsomething else before long. Did you ever sail out of Whitehaven?\"\n\n\"No, Captain.\"\n\n\"If you had, you'd have heard sad stories about me. To this hour they\nsay there that I--bloodthirsty, coward dog that I am--flogged a sailor,\none Mungo Maxwell, to death. It's a lie, by Heaven! I flogged him, for\nhe was a mutinous scamp. But he died naturally, some time afterwards,\nand on board another ship. But why talk? They didn't believe the\naffidavits of others taken before London courts, triumphantly acquitting\nme; how then will they credit _my_ interested words? If slander, however\nmuch a lie, once gets hold of a man, it will stick closer than fair\nfame, as black pitch sticks closer than white cream. But let 'em\nslander. I will give the slanderers matter for curses. When last I left\nWhitehaven, I swore never again to set foot on her pier, except, like\nCaesar, at Sandwich, as a foreign invader. Spring under me, good ship;\non you I bound to my vengeance!\"\n\nMen with poignant feelings, buried under an air of care-free self\ncommand, are never proof to the sudden incitements of passion. Though\nin the main they may control themselves, yet if they but once permit the\nsmallest vent, then they may bid adieu to all self-restraint, at least\nfor that time. Thus with Paul on the present occasion. His sympathy with\nIsrael had prompted this momentary ebullition. When it was gone by, he\nseemed not a little to regret it. But he passed it over lightly, saying,\n\"You see, my fine fellow, what sort of a bloody cannibal I am. Will you\nbe a sailor of mine? A sailor of the Captain who flogged poor Mungo\nMaxwell to death?\"\n\n\"I will be very happy, Captain Paul, to be sailor under the man who will\nyet, I dare say, help flog the British nation to death.\"\n\n\"You hate 'em, do ye?\"\n\n\"Like snakes. For months they've hunted me as a dog,\" half howled and\nhalf wailed Israel, at the memory of all he had suffered.\n\n\"Give me your hand, my lion; wave your wild flax again. By Heaven, you\nhate so well, I love ye. You shall be my confidential man; stand sentry\nat my cabin door; sleep in the cabin; steer my boat; keep by my side\nwhenever I land. What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say I'm glad to hear you.\"\n\n\"You are a good, brave soul. You are the first among the millions of\nmankind that I ever naturally took to. Come, you are tired. There, go\ninto that state-room for to-night--it's mine. You offered me your bed in\nParis.\"\n\n\"But you begged off, Captain, and so must I. Where do you sleep?\"\n\n\"Lad, I don't sleep half a night out of three. My clothes have not been\noff now for five days.\"\n\n\"Ah, Captain, you sleep so little and scheme so much, you will die\nyoung.\"\n\n\"I know it: I want to: I mean to. Who would live a doddered old stump?\nWhat do you think of my Scotch bonnet?\"\n\n\"It looks well on you, Captain.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? A Scotch bonnet, though, ought to look well on a\nScotchman. I'm such by birth. Is the gold band too much?\"\n\n\"I like the gold band, Captain. It looks something as I should think a\ncrown might on a king.\"\n\n\"Aye?\"\n\n\"You would make a better-looking king than George III.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see that old granny? Waddles about in farthingales, and\ncarries a peacock fan, don't he? Did you ever see him?\"\n\n\"Was as close to him as I am to you now, Captain. In Kew Gardens it was,\nwhere I worked gravelling the walks. I was all alone with him, talking\nfor some ten minutes.\"\n\n\"By Jove, what a chance! Had I but been there! What an opportunity for\nkidnapping a British king, and carrying him off in a fast sailing smack\nto Boston, a hostage for American freedom. But what did you? Didn't you\ntry to do something to him?\"\n\n\"I had a wicked thought or two, Captain, but I got the better of it.\nBesides, the king behaved handsomely towards me; yes, like a true man.\nGod bless him for it. But it was before that, that I got the better of\nthe wicked thought.\"\n\n\"Ah, meant to stick him, I suppose. Glad you didn't. It would have been\nvery shabby. Never kill a king, but make him captive. He looks better as\na led horse, than a dead carcass. I propose now, this trip, falling on\nthe grounds of the Earl of Selkirk, a privy counsellor and particular\nprivate friend of George III. But I won't hurt a hair of his head. When\nI get him on board here, he shall lodge in my best state-room, which I\nmean to hang with damask for him. I shall drink wine with him, and be\nvery friendly; take him to America, and introduce his lordship into the\nbest circles there; only I shall have him accompanied on his calls by a\nsentry or two disguised as valets. For the Earl's to be on sale, mind;\nso much ransom; that is, the nobleman, Lord Selkirk, shall have a bodily\nprice pinned on his coat-tail, like any slave up at auction in\nCharleston. But, my lad with the yellow mane, you very strangely draw\nout my secrets. And yet you don't talk. Your honesty is a magnet which\nattracts my sincerity. But I rely on your fidelity.\"\n\n\"I shall be a vice to your plans, Captain Paul. I will receive, but I\nwon't let go, unless you alone loose the screw.\"\n\n\"Well said. To bed now; you ought to. I go on deck. Good night,\nace-of-hearts.\"\n\n\"That is fitter for yourself, Captain Paul, lonely leader of the suit.\"\n\n\"Lonely? Aye, but number one cannot but be lonely, my trump.\"\n\n\"Again I give it back. Ace-of-trumps may it prove to you, Captain Paul;\nmay it be impossible for you ever to be taken. But for me--poor deuce, a\ntrey, that comes in your wake--any king or knave may take me, as before\nnow the knaves have.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, lad; never be more cheery for another than for yourself. But\na fagged body fags the soul. To hammock, to hammock! while I go on deck\nto clap on more sail to your cradle.\"\n\nAnd they separated for that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHEY SAIL AS FAR AS THE CRAG OF AILSA.\n\n\nNext morning Israel was appointed quartermaster--a subaltern selected\nfrom the common seamen, and whose duty mostly stations him in the stern\nof the ship, where the captain walks. His business is to carry the glass\non the look-out for sails; hoist or lower the colors; and keep an eye on\nthe helmsman. Picked out from the crew for their superior respectability\nand intelligence, as well as for their excellent seamanship, it is not\nunusual to find the quartermasters of an armed ship on peculiarly easy\nterms with the commissioned officers and captain. This birth, therefore,\nplaced Israel in official contiguity to Paul, and without subjecting\neither to animadversion, made their public intercourse on deck almost as\nfamiliar as their unrestrained converse in the cabin.\n\nIt was a fine cool day in the beginning of April. They were now off the\ncoast of Wales, whose lofty mountains, crested with snow, presented a\nNorwegian aspect. The wind was fair, and blew with a strange, bestirring\npower. The ship--running between Ireland and England, northwards,\ntowards the Irish Sea, the inmost heart of the British waters--seemed,\nas she snortingly shook the spray from her bow, to be conscious of the\ndare-devil defiance of the soul which conducted her on this anomalous\ncruise. Sailing alone from out a naval port of France, crowded with\nships-of-the-line, Paul Jones, in his small craft, went forth in\nsingle-armed championship against the English host. Armed with but the\nsling-stones in his one shot-locker, like young David of old, Paul\nbearded the British giant of Gath. It is not easy, at the present day,\nto conceive the hardihood of this enterprise. It was a marching up to\nthe muzzle; the act of one who made no compromise with the cannonadings\nof danger or death; such a scheme as only could have inspired a heart\nwhich held at nothing all the prescribed prudence of war, and every\nobligation of peace; combining in one breast the vengeful indignation\nand bitter ambition of an outraged hero, with the uncompunctuous\ndesperation of a renegade. In one view, the Coriolanus of the sea; in\nanother, a cross between the gentleman and the wolf.\n\nAs Paul stood on the elevated part of the quarter-deck, with none but his\nconfidential quartermaster near him, he yielded to Israel's natural\ncuriosity to learn something concerning the sailing of the expedition.\nPaul stood lightly, swaying his body over the sea, by holding on to the\nmizzen-shrouds, an attitude not inexpressive of his easy audacity; while\nnear by, pacing a few steps to and fro, his long spy-glass now under his\narm, and now presented at his eye, Israel, looking the very image of\nvigilant prudence, listened to the warrior's story. It appeared that on\nthe night of the visit of the Duke de Chartres and Count D'Estaing to\nDoctor Franklin in Paris--the same night that Captain Paul and Israel\nwere joint occupants of the neighboring chamber--the final sanction of\nthe French king to the sailing of an American armament against England,\nunder the direction of the Colonial Commissioner, was made known to the\nlatter functionary. It was a very ticklish affair. Though swaying on the\nbrink of avowed hostilities with England, no verbal declaration had as\nyet been made by France. Undoubtedly, this enigmatic position of things\nwas highly advantageous to such an enterprise as Paul's.\n\nWithout detailing all the steps taken through the united efforts of\nCaptain Paul and Doctor Franklin, suffice it that the determined rover\nhad now attained his wish--the unfettered command of an armed ship in\nthe British waters; a ship legitimately authorized to hoist the American\ncolors, her commander having in his cabin-locker a regular commission as\nan officer of the American navy. He sailed without any instructions.\nWith that rare insight into rare natures which so largely distinguished\nthe sagacious Franklin, the sage well knew that a prowling _brave_, like\nPaul Jones, was, like the prowling lion, by nature a solitary warrior.\n\"Let him alone,\" was the wise man's answer to some statesman who sought\nto hamper Paul with a letter of instructions.\n\nMuch subtile casuistry has been expended upon the point, whether Paul\nJones was a knave or a hero, or a union of both. But war and warriors,\nlike politics and politicians, like religion and religionists, admit of\nno metaphysics.\n\nOn the second day after Israel's arrival on board the Ranger, as he and\nPaul were conversing on the deck, Israel suddenly levelling his glass\ntowards the Irish coast, announced a large sail bound in. The Ranger\ngave chase, and soon, almost within sight of her destination--the port\nof Dublin--the stranger was taken, manned, and turned round for Brest.\n\nThe Ranger then stood over, passed the Isle of Man towards the\nCumberland shore, arriving within remote sight of Whitehaven about\nsunset. At dark she was hovering off the harbor, with a party of\nvolunteers all ready to descend. But the wind shifted and blew fresh\nwith a violent sea.\n\n\"I won't call on old friends in foul weather,\" said Captain Paul to\nIsrael. \"We'll saunter about a little, and leave our cards in a day or\ntwo.\"\n\nNext morning, in Glentinebay, on the south shore of Scotland, they fell\nin with a revenue wherry. It was the practice of such craft to board\nmerchant vessels. The Ranger was disguised as a merchantman, presenting\na broad drab-colored belt all round her hull; under the coat of a\nQuaker, concealing the intent of a Turk. It was expected that the\nchartered rover would come alongside the unchartered one. But the former\ntook to flight, her two lug sails staggering under a heavy wind, which\nthe pursuing guns of the Ranger pelted with a hail-storm of shot. The\nwherry escaped, spite the severe cannonade.\n\nOff the Mull of Galoway, the day following, Paul found himself so nigh a\nlarge barley-freighted Scotch coaster, that, to prevent her carrying\ntidings of him to land, he dispatched her with the news, stern foremost,\nto Hades; sinking her, and sowing her barley in the sea broadcast by a\nbroadside. From her crew he learned that there was a fleet of twenty or\nthirty sail at anchor in Lochryan, with an armed brigantine. He pointed\nhis prow thither; but at the mouth of the lock, the wind turned against\nhim again in hard squalls. He abandoned the project. Shortly after, he\nencountered a sloop from Dublin. He sunk her to prevent intelligence.\n\nThus, seeming as much to bear the elemental commission of Nature, as the\nmilitary warrant of Congress, swarthy Paul darted hither and thither;\nhovering like a thundercloud off the crowded harbors; then, beaten off\nby an adverse wind, discharging his lightnings on uncompanioned vessels,\nwhose solitude made them a more conspicuous and easier mark, like lonely\ntrees on the heath. Yet all this while the land was full of garrisons,\nthe embayed waters full of fleets. With the impunity of a Levanter, Paul\nskimmed his craft in the land-locked heart of the supreme naval power of\nearth; a torpedo-eel, unknowingly swallowed by Britain in a draught of\nold ocean, and making sad havoc with her vitals.\n\nSeeing next a large vessel steering for the Clyde, he gave chase, hoping\nto cut her off. The stranger proving a fast sailer, the pursuit was\nurged on with vehemence, Paul standing, plank-proud, on the\nquarter-deck, calling for pulls upon every rope, to stretch each already\nhalf-burst sail to the uttermost.\n\nWhile thus engaged, suddenly a shadow, like that thrown by an eclipse,\nwas seen rapidly gaining along the deck, with a sharp defined line,\nplain as a seam of the planks. It involved all before it. It was the\ndomineering shadow of the Juan Fernandez-like crag of Ailsa. The Ranger\nwas in the deep water which makes all round and close up to this great\nsummit of the submarine Grampians.\n\nThe crag, more than a mile in circuit, is over a thousand feet high,\neight miles from the Ayrshire shore. There stands the cove, lonely as a\nfoundling, proud as Cheops. But, like the battered brains surmounting\nthe Giant of Gath, its haughty summit is crowned by a desolate castle,\nin and out of whose arches the aerial mists eddy like purposeless\nphantoms, thronging the soul of some ruinous genius, who, even in\noverthrow, harbors none but lofty conceptions.\n\nAs the Ranger shot higher under the crag, its height and bulk dwarfed\nboth pursuer and pursued into nutshells. The main-truck of the Ranger\nwas nine hundred feet below the foundations of the ruin on the crag's\ntop:\n\nWhile the ship was yet under the shadow, and each seaman's face shared\nin the general eclipse, a sudden change came over Paul. He issued no\nmore sultanical orders. He did not look so elate as before. At length he\ngave the command to discontinue the chase. Turning about, they sailed\nsouthward.\n\n\"Captain Paul,\" said Israel, shortly afterwards, \"you changed your mind\nrather queerly about catching that craft. But you thought she was\ndrawing us too far up into the land, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Sink the craft,\" cried Paul; \"it was not any fear of her, nor of King\nGeorge, which made me turn on my heel; it was yon cock of the walk.\"\n\n\"Cock of the walk?\"\n\n\"Aye, cock of the walk of the sea; look--yon Crag of Ailsa.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHEY LOOK IN AT CARRICKFERGUS, AND DESCEND ON WHITEHAVEN.\n\n\nNext day, off Carrickfergus, on the Irish coast, a fishing boat, allured\nby the Quaker-like look of the incognito craft, came off in full\nconfidence. Her men were seized, their vessel sunk. From them Paul\nlearned that the large ship at anchor in the road, was the ship-of-war\nDrake, of twenty guns. Upon this he steered away, resolving to return\nsecretly, and attack her that night.\n\n\"Surely, Captain Paul,\" said Israel to his commander, as about sunset\nthey backed and stood in again for the land \"surely, sir, you are not\ngoing right in among them this way? Why not wait till she comes out?\"\n\n\"Because, Yellow-hair, my boy, I am engaged to marry her to-night. The\nbride's friends won't like the match; and so, this very night, the bride\nmust be carried away. She has a nice tapering waist, hasn't she, through\nthe glass? Ah! I will clasp her to my heart.\"\n\nHe steered straight in like a friend; under easy sail, lounging towards\nthe Drake, with anchor ready to drop, and grapnels to hug. But the wind\nwas high; the anchor was not dropped at the ordered time. The ranger\ncame to a stand three biscuits' toss off the unmisgiving enemy's\nquarter, like a peaceful merchantman from the Canadas, laden with\nharmless lumber.\n\n\"I shan't marry her just yet,\" whispered Paul, seeing his plans for the\ntime frustrated. Gazing in audacious tranquillity upon the decks of the\nenemy, and amicably answering her hail, with complete self-possession,\nhe commanded the cable to be slipped, and then, as if he had\naccidentally parted his anchor, turned his prow on the seaward tack,\nmeaning to return again immediately with the same prospect of advantage\npossessed at first--his plan being to crash suddenly athwart the Drake's\nbow, so as to have all her decks exposed point-blank to his musketry.\nBut once more the winds interposed. It came on with a storm of snow; he\nwas obliged to give up his project.\n\nThus, without any warlike appearance, and giving no alarm, Paul, like an\ninvisible ghost, glided by night close to land, actually came to anchor,\nfor an instant, within speaking-distance of an English ship-of-war; and\nyet came, anchored, answered hail, reconnoitered, debated, decided, and\nretired, without exciting the least suspicion. His purpose was\nchain-shot destruction. So easily may the deadliest foe--so he be but\ndexterous--slide, undreamed of, into human harbors or hearts. And not\nawakened conscience, but mere prudence, restrain such, if they vanish\nagain without doing harm. At daybreak no soul in Carrickfergus knew that\nthe devil, in a Scotch bonnet, had passed close that way over night.\n\nSeldom has regicidal daring been more strangely coupled with\noctogenarian prudence, than in many of the predatory enterprises of\nPaul. It is this combination of apparent incompatibilities which ranks\nhim among extraordinary warriors.\n\nEre daylight, the storm of the night blew over. The sun saw the Ranger\nlying midway over channel at the head of the Irish Sea; England,\nScotland, and Ireland, with all their lofty cliffs, being as\nsimultaneously as plainly in sight beyond the grass-green waters, as the\nCity Hall, St. Paul's, and the Astor House, from the triangular Park in\nNew York. The three kingdoms lay covered with snow, far as the eye could\nreach.\n\n\"Ah, Yellow-hair,\" said Paul, with a smile, \"they show the white flag,\nthe cravens. And, while the white flag stays blanketing yonder heights,\nwe'll make for Whitehaven, my boy. I promised to drop in there a moment\nere quitting the country for good. Israel, lad, I mean to step ashore in\nperson, and have a personal hand in the thing. Did you ever drive\nspikes?\"\n\n\"I've driven the spike-teeth into harrows before now,\" replied Israel;\n\"but that was before I was a sailor.\"\n\n\"Well, then, driving spikes into harrows is a good introduction to\ndriving spikes into cannon. You are just the man. Put down your glass;\ngo to the carpenter, get a hundred spikes, put them in a bucket with a\nhammer, and bring all to me.\"\n\nAs evening fell, the great promontory of St. Bee's Head, with its\nlighthouse, not far from Whitehaven, was in distant sight. But the wind\nbecame so light that Paul could not work his ship in close enough at an\nhour as early as intended. His purpose had been to make the descent and\nretire ere break of day. But though this intention was frustrated, he\ndid not renounce his plan, for the present would be his last\nopportunity.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the ship, with a very light wind, glided\nnigher and nigher the mark, Paul called upon Israel to produce his\nbucket for final inspection. Thinking some of the spikes too large, he\nhad them filed down a little. He saw to the lanterns and combustibles.\nLike Peter the Great, he went into the smallest details, while still\npossessing a genius competent to plan the aggregate. But oversee as one\nmay, it is impossible to guard against carelessness in subordinates.\nOne's sharp eyes can't see behind one's back. It will yet be noted that\nan important omission was made in the preparations for Whitehaven.\n\nThe town contained, at that period, a population of some six or seven\nthousand inhabitants, defended by forts.\n\nAt midnight, Paul Jones, Israel Potter, and twenty-nine others, rowed in\ntwo boats to attack the six or seven thousand inhabitants of Whitehaven.\nThere was a long way to pull. This was done in perfect silence. Not a\nsound was heard except the oars turning in the row-locks. Nothing was\nseen except the two lighthouses of the harbor. Through the stillness and\nthe darkness, the two deep-laden boats swam into the haven, like two\nmysterious whales from the Arctic Sea. As they reached the outer pier,\nthe men saw each other's faces. The day was dawning. The riggers and\nother artisans of the shipping would before very long be astir. No\nmatter.\n\nThe great staple exported from Whitehaven was then, and still is, coal.\nThe town is surrounded by mines; the town is built on mines; the ships\nmoor over mines. The mines honeycomb the land in all directions, and\nextend in galleries of grottoes for two miles under the sea. By the\nfalling in of the more ancient collieries numerous houses have been\nswallowed, as if by an earthquake, and a consternation spread, like that\nof Lisbon, in 1755. So insecure and treacherous was the site of the\nplace now about to be assailed by a desperado, nursed, like the coal, in\nits vitals.\n\nNow, sailing on the Thames, nigh its mouth, of fair days, when the wind\nis favorable for inward-bound craft, the stranger will sometimes see\nprocessions of vessels, all of similar size and rig, stretching for\nmiles and miles, like a long string of horses tied two and two to a rope\nand driven to market. These are colliers going to London with coal.\n\nAbout three hundred of these vessels now lay, all crowded together, in\none dense mob, at Whitehaven. The tide was out. They lay completely\nhelpless, clear of water, and grounded. They were sooty in hue. Their\nblack yards were deeply canted, like spears, to avoid collision. The\nthree hundred grimy hulls lay wallowing in the mud, like a herd of\nhippopotami asleep in the alluvium of the Nile. Their sailless, raking\nmasts, and canted yards, resembled a forest of fish-spears thrust into\nthose same hippopotamus hides. Partly flanking one side of the grounded\nfleet was a fort, whose batteries were raised from the beach. On a\nlittle strip of this beach, at the base of the fort, lay a number of\nsmall rusty guns, dismounted, heaped together in disorder, as a litter\nof dogs. Above them projected the mounted cannon.\n\nPaul landed in his own boat at the foot of this fort. He dispatched the\nother boat to the north side of the haven, with orders to fire the\nshipping there. Leaving two men at the beach, he then proceeded to get\npossession of the fort.\n\n\"Hold on to the bucket, and give me your shoulder,\" said he to Israel.\n\nUsing Israel for a ladder, in a trice he scaled the wall. The bucket and\nthe men followed. He led the way softly to the guard-house, burst in,\nand bound the sentinels in their sleep. Then arranging his force,\nordered four men to spike the cannon there.\n\n\"Now, Israel, your bucket, and follow me to the other fort.\"\n\nThe two went alone about a quarter of a mile.\n\n\"Captain Paul,\" said Israel, on the way, \"can we two manage the\nsentinels?\"\n\n\"There are none in the fort we go to.\"\n\n\"You know all about the place, Captain?\"\n\n\"Pretty well informed on that subject, I believe. Come along. Yes, lad,\nI am tolerably well acquainted with Whitehaven. And this morning intend\nthat Whitehaven shall have a slight inkling of _me_. Come on. Here we\nare.\"\n\nScaling the walls, the two involuntarily stood for an instant gazing\nupon the scene. The gray light of the dawn showed the crowded houses and\nthronged ships with a haggard distinctness.\n\n\"Spike and hammer, lad;--so,--now follow me along, as I go, and give me\na spike for every cannon. I'll tongue-tie the thunderers. Speak no\nmore!\" and he spiked the first gun. \"Be a mute,\" and he spiked the\nsecond. \"Dumbfounder thee,\" and he spiked the third. And so, on, and on,\nand on, Israel following him with the bucket, like a footman, or some\ncharitable gentleman with a basket of alms.\n\n\"There, it is done. D'ye see the fire yet, lad, from the south? I\ndon't.\"\n\n\"Not a spark, Captain. But day-sparks come on in the east.\"\n\n\"Forked flames into the hounds! What are they about? Quick, let us back\nto the first fort; perhaps something has happened, and they are there.\"\n\nSure enough, on their return from spiking the cannon, Paul and Israel\nfound the other boat back, the crew in confusion, their lantern having\nburnt out at the very instant they wanted it. By a singular fatality the\nother lantern, belonging to Paul's boat, was likewise extinguished. No\ntinder-box had been brought. They had no matches but sulphur matches.\nLocofocos were not then known.\n\nThe day came on apace.\n\n\"Captain Paul,\" said the lieutenant of the second boat, \"it is madness\nto stay longer. See!\" and he pointed to the town, now plainly\ndiscernible in the gray light.\n\n\"Traitor, or coward!\" howled Paul, \"how came the lanterns out? Israel,\nmy lion, now prove your blood. Get me a light--but one spark!\"\n\n\"Has any man here a bit of pipe and tobacco in his pocket?\" said\nIsrael.\n\nA sailor quickly produced an old stump of a pipe, with tobacco.\n\n\"That will do,\" and Israel hurried away towards the town.\n\n\"What will the loon do with the pipe?\" said one. \"And where goes he?\"\ncried another.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said Paul.\n\nThe invader now disposed his whole force so as to retreat at an\ninstant's warning. Meantime the hardy Israel, long experienced in all\nsorts of shifts and emergencies, boldly ventured to procure, from some\ninhabitant of Whitehaven, a spark to kindle all Whitehaven's habitations\nin flames.\n\nThere was a lonely house standing somewhat disjointed from the town,\nsome poor laborer's abode. Rapping at the door, Israel, pipe in mouth,\nbegged the inmates for a light for his tobacco.\n\n\"What the devil,\" roared a voice from within, \"knock up a man this time\nof night to light your pipe? Begone!\"\n\n\"You are lazy this morning, my friend,\" replied Israel, \"it is daylight.\nQuick, give me a light. Don't you know your old friend? Shame! open the\ndoor.\"\n\nIn a moment a sleepy fellow appeared, let down the bar, and Israel,\nstalking into the dim room, piloted himself straight to the fire-place,\nraked away the cinders, lighted his tobacco, and vanished.\n\nAll was done in a flash. The man, stupid with sleep, had looked on\nbewildered. He reeled to the door, but, dodging behind a pile of\nbricks, Israel had already hurried himself out of sight.\n\n\"Well done, my lion,\" was the hail he received from Paul, who, during\nhis absence, had mustered as many pipes as possible, in order to\ncommunicate and multiply the fire.\n\nBoth boats now pulled to a favorable point of the principal pier of the\nharbor, crowded close up to a part of which lay one wing of the\ncolliers.\n\nThe men began to murmur at persisting in an attempt impossible to be\nconcealed much longer. They were afraid to venture on board the grim\ncolliers, and go groping down into their hulls to fire them. It seemed\nlike a voluntary entrance into dungeons and death.\n\n\"Follow me, all of you but ten by the boats,\" said Paul, without\nnoticing their murmurs. \"And now, to put an end to all future burnings\nin America, by one mighty conflagration of shipping in England. Come on,\nlads! Pipes and matches in the van!\"\n\nHe would have distributed the men so as simultaneously to fire different\nships at different points, were it not that the lateness of the hour\nrendered such a course insanely hazardous. Stationing his party in front\nof one of the windward colliers, Paul and Israel sprang on board.\n\nIn a twinkling they had broken open a boatswain's locker, and, with\ngreat bunches of oakum, fine and dry as tinder, had leaped into the\nsteerage. Here, while Paul made a blaze, Israel ran to collect the\ntar-pots, which being presently poured on the burning matches, oakum and\nwood, soon increased the flame.\n\n\"It is not a sure thing yet,\" said Paul, \"we must have a barrel of\ntar.\"\n\nThey searched about until they found one, knocked out the head and\nbottom, and stood it like a martyr in the midst of the flames. They then\nretreated up the forward hatchway, while volumes of smoke were belched\nfrom the after one. Not till this moment did Paul hear the cries of his\nmen, warning him that the inhabitants were not only actually astir, but\ncrowds were on their way to the pier.\n\nAs he sprang out of the smoke towards the rail of the collier, he saw\nthe sun risen, with thousands of the people. Individuals hurried close\nto the burning vessel. Leaping to the ground, Paul, bidding his men\nstand fast, ran to their front, and, advancing about thirty feet,\npresented his own pistol at now tumultuous Whitehaven.\n\nThose who had rushed to extinguish what they had deemed but an\naccidental fire, were now paralyzed into idiotic inaction, at the\ndefiance of the incendiary, thinking him some sudden pirate or fiend\ndropped down from the moon.\n\nWhile Paul thus stood guarding the incipient conflagration, Israel,\nwithout a weapon, dashed crazily towards the mob on the shore.\n\n\"Come back, come back,\" cried Paul.\n\n\"Not till I start these sheep, as their own wolves many a time started\nme!\"\n\nAs he rushed bare-headed like a madman, towards the crowd, the panic\nspread. They fled from unarmed Israel, further than they had from the\npistol of Paul.\n\nThe flames now catching the rigging and spiralling around the masts,\nthe whole ship burned at one end of the harbor, while the sun, an hour\nhigh, burned at the other. Alarm and amazement, not sleep, now ruled the\nworld. It was time to retreat.\n\nThey re-embarked without opposition, first releasing a few prisoners, as\nthe boats could not carry them.\n\nJust as Israel was leaping into the boat, he saw the man at whose house\nhe had procured the fire, staring like a simpleton at him.\n\n\"That was good seed you gave me;\" said Israel, \"see what a yield,\"\npointing to the flames. He then dropped into the boat, leaving only Paul\non the pier.\n\nThe men cried to their commander, conjuring him not to linger.\n\nBut Paul remained for several moments, confronting in silence the\nclamors of the mob beyond, and waving his solitary hand, like a\ndisdainful tomahawk, towards the surrounding eminences, also covered\nwith the affrighted inhabitants.\n\nWhen the assailants had rowed pretty well off, the English rushed in\ngreat numbers to their forts, but only to find their cannon no better\nthan so much iron in the ore. At length, however, they began to fire,\nhaving either brought down some ship's guns, or else mounted the rusty\nold dogs lying at the foot of the first fort.\n\nIn their eagerness they fired with no discretion. The shot fell short;\nthey did not the slightest damage.\n\nPaul's men laughed aloud, and fired their pistols in the air.\n\nNot a splinter was made, not a drop of blood spilled throughout the\naffair. The intentional harmlessness of the result, as to human life,\nwas only equalled by the desperate courage of the deed. It formed,\ndoubtless, one feature of the compassionate contempt of Paul towards\nthe town, that he took such paternal care of their lives and limbs.\n\nHad it been possible to have landed a few hours earlier not a ship nor a\nhouse could have escaped. But it was the lesson, not the loss, that\ntold. As it was, enough damage had been done to demonstrate--as Paul had\ndeclared to the wise man of Paris--that the disasters caused by the\nwanton fires and assaults on the American coasts, could be easily\nbrought home to the enemy's doors. Though, indeed, if the retaliators\nwere headed by Paul Jones, the satisfaction would not be equal to the\ninsult, being abated by the magnanimity of a chivalrous, however\nunprincipled a foe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHEY CALL AT THE EARL OF SELKIRK'S, AND AFTERWARDS FIGHT THE SHIP-OF-WAR\nDRAKE.\n\n\nThe Ranger now stood over the Solway Frith for the Scottish shore, and\nat noon on the same day, Paul, with twelve men, including two officers\nand Israel, landed on St. Mary's Isle, one of the seats of the Earl of\nSelkirk.\n\nIn three consecutive days this elemental warrior either entered the\nharbors or landed on the shores of each of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nThe morning was fair and clear. St. Mary's Isle lay shimmering in the\nsun. The light crust of snow had melted, revealing the tender grass and\nsweet buds of spring mantling the sides of the cliffs.\n\nAt once, upon advancing with his party towards the house, Paul augured\nill for his project from the loneliness of the spot. No being was seen.\nBut cocking his bonnet at a jaunty angle, he continued his way.\nStationing the men silently round about the house, fallowed by Israel,\nhe announced his presence at the porch.\n\nA gray-headed domestic at length responded.\n\n\"Is the Earl within?\"\n\n\"He is in Edinburgh, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah--sure?--Is your lady within?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--who shall I say it is?\"\n\n\"A gentleman who calls to pay his respects. Here, take my card.\"\n\nAnd he handed the man his name, as a private gentleman, superbly\nengraved at Paris, on gilded paper.\n\nIsrael tarried in the hall while the old servant led Paul into a parlor.\n\nPresently the lady appeared.\n\n\"Charming Madame, I wish you a very good morning.\"\n\n\"Who may it be, sir, that I have the happiness to see?\" said the lady,\ncensoriously drawing herself up at the too frank gallantry of the\nstranger.\n\n\"Madame, I sent you my card.\"\n\n\"Which leaves me equally ignorant, sir,\" said the lady, coldly, twirling\nthe gilded pasteboard.\n\n\"A courier dispatched to Whitehaven, charming Madame, might bring you\nmore particular tidings as to who has the honor of being your visitor.\"\n\nNot comprehending what this meant, and deeply displeased, if not vaguely\nalarmed, at the characteristic manner of Paul, the lady, not entirely\nunembarrassed, replied, that if the gentleman came to view the isle, he\nwas at liberty so to do. She would retire and send him a guide.\n\n\"Countess of Selkirk,\" said Paul, advancing a step, \"I call to see the\nEarl. On business of urgent importance, I call.\"\n\n\"The Earl is in Edinburgh,\" uneasily responded the lady, again about to\nretire.\n\n\"Do you give me your honor as a lady that it is as you say?\"\n\nThe lady looked at him in dubious resentment.\n\n\"Pardon, Madame, I would not lightly impugn a lady's lightest word, but\nI surmised that, possibly, you might suspect the object of my call, in\nwhich case it would be the most excusable thing in the world for you to\nseek to shelter from my knowledge the presence of the Earl on the isle.\"\n\n\"I do not dream what you mean by all this,\" said the lady with a decided\nalarm, yet even in her panic courageously maintaining her dignity, as\nshe retired, rather than retreated, nearer the door.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Paul, hereupon waving his hand imploringly, and then\ntenderly playing with his bonnet with the golden band, while an\nexpression poetically sad and sentimental stole over his tawny face; \"it\ncannot be too poignantly lamented that, in the profession of arms, the\nofficer of fine feelings and genuine sensibility should be sometimes\nnecessitated to public actions which his own private heart cannot\napprove. This hard case is mine. The Earl, Madame, you say is absent. I\nbelieve those words. Far be it from my soul, enchantress, to ascribe a\nfault to syllables which have proceeded from so faultless a source.\"\n\nThis probably he said in reference to the lady's mouth, which was\nbeautiful in the extreme.\n\nHe bowed very lowly, while the lady eyed him with conflicting and\ntroubled emotions, but as yet all in darkness as to his ultimate\nmeaning. But her more immediate alarm had subsided, seeing now that the\nsailor-like extravagance of Paul's homage was entirely unaccompanied\nwith any touch of intentional disrespect. Indeed, hyperbolical as were\nhis phrases, his gestures and whole carriage were most heedfully\ndeferential.\n\nPaul continued: \"The Earl, Madame, being absent, and he being the sole\nobject of my call, you cannot labor under the least apprehension, when I\nnow inform you, that I have the honor of being an officer in the\nAmerican Navy, who, having stopped at this isle to secure the person of\nthe Earl of Selkirk as a hostage for the American cause, am, by your\nassurances, turned away from that intent; pleased, even in\ndisappointment, since that disappointment has served to prolong my\ninterview with the noble lady before me, as well as to leave her\ndomestic tranquillity unimpaired.\"\n\n\"Can you really speak true?\" said the lady in undismayed wonderment.\n\n\"Madame, through your window you will catch a little peep of the\nAmerican colonial ship-of-war, Ranger, which I have the honor to\ncommand. With my best respects to your lord, and sincere regrets at not\nfinding him at home, permit me to salute your ladyship's hand and\nwithdraw.\"\n\nBut feigning not to notice this Parisian proposition, and artfully\nentrenching her hand, without seeming to do so, the lady, in a\nconciliatory tone, begged her visitor to partake of some refreshment ere\nhe departed, at the same time thanking him for his great civility. But\ndeclining these hospitalities, Paul bowed thrice and quitted the room.\n\nIn the hall he encountered Israel, standing all agape before a Highland\ntarget of steel, with a claymore and foil crossed on top.\n\n\"Looks like a pewter platter and knife and fork, Captain Paul.\"\n\n\"So they do, my lion; but come, curse it, the old cock has flown; fine\nhen, though, left in the nest; no use; we must away empty-handed.\"\n\n\"Why, ain't Mr. Selkirk in?\" demanded Israel in roguish concern.\n\n\"Mr. Selkirk? Alexander Selkirk, you mean. No, lad, he's not on the Isle\nof St. Mary's; he's away off, a hermit, on the Isle of Juan\nFernandez--the more's the pity; come.\"\n\nIn the porch they encountered the two officers. Paul briefly informed\nthem of the circumstances, saying, nothing remained but to depart\nforthwith.\n\n\"With nothing at all for our pains?\" murmured the two officers.\n\n\"What, pray, would you have?\"\n\n\"Some pillage, to be sure--plate.\"\n\n\"Shame. I thought we were three gentlemen.\"\n\n\"So are the English officers in America; but they help themselves to\nplate whenever they can get it from the private houses of the enemy.\"\n\n\"Come, now, don't be slanderous,\" said Paul; \"these officers you speak\nof are but one or two out of twenty, mere burglars and light-fingered\ngentry, using the king's livery but as a disguise to their nefarious\ntrade. The rest are men of honor.\"\n\n\"Captain Paul Jones,\" responded the two, \"we have not come on this\nexpedition in much expectation of regular pay; but we _did_ rely upon\nhonorable plunder.\"\n\n\"Honorable plunder! That's something new.\"\n\nBut the officers were not to be turned aside. They were the most\nefficient in the ship. Seeing them resolute, Paul, for fear of incensing\nthem, was at last, as a matter of policy, obliged to comply. For\nhimself, however, he resolved to have nothing to do with the affair.\nCharging the officers not to allow the men to enter the house on any\npretence, and that no search must be made, and nothing must be taken\naway, except what the lady should offer them upon making known their\ndemand, he beckoned to Israel and retired indignantly towards the beach.\nUpon second thoughts, he dispatched Israel back, to enter the house with\nthe officers, as joint receiver of the plate, he being, of course, the\nmost reliable of the seamen.\n\nThe lady was not a little disconcerted on receiving the officers. With\ncool determination they made known their purpose. There was no escape.\nThe lady retired. The butler came; and soon, several silver salvers, and\nother articles of value, were silently deposited in the parlor in the\npresence of the officers and Israel.\n\n\"Mister Butler,\" said Israel, \"let me go into the dairy and help to\ncarry the milk-pans.\"\n\nBut, scowling upon this rusticity, or roguishness--he knew not\nwhich--the butler, in high dudgeon at Israel's republican familiarity,\nas well as black as a thundercloud with the general insult offered to\nan illustrious household by a party of armed thieves, as he viewed them,\ndeclined any assistance. In a quarter of an hour the officers left the\nhouse, carrying their booty.\n\nAt the porch they were met by a red-cheeked, spiteful-looking lass, who,\nwith her brave lady's compliments, added two child's rattles of silver\nand coral to their load.\n\nNow, one of the officers was a Frenchman, the other a Spaniard.\n\nThe Spaniard dashed his rattle indignantly to the ground. The Frenchman\ntook his very pleasantly, and kissed it, saying to the girl that he\nwould long preserve the coral, as a memento of her rosy cheeks.\n\nWhen the party arrived on the beach, they found Captain Paul writing\nwith pencil on paper held up against the smooth tableted side of the\ncliff. Next moment he seemed to be making his signature. With a\nreproachful glance towards the two officers, he handed the slip to\nIsrael, bidding him hasten immediately with it to the house and place it\nin Lady Selkirk's own hands.\n\nThe note was as follows:\n\n\"Madame:\n\n\"After so courteous a reception, I am disturbed to make you no better\nreturn than you have just experienced from the actions of certain\npersons under my command.--actions, lady, which my profession of arms\nobliges me not only to brook, but, in a measure, to countenance. From\nthe bottom of my heart, my dear lady, I deplore this most melancholy\nnecessity of my delicate position. However unhandsome the desire of these\nmen, some complaisance seemed due them from me, for their general good\nconduct and bravery on former occasions. I had but an instant to\nconsider. I trust, that in unavoidably gratifying them, I have inflicted\nless injury on your ladyship's property than I have on my own bleeding\nsensibilities. But my heart will not allow me to say more. Permit me to\nassure you, dear lady, that when the plate is sold, I shall, at all\nhazards, become the purchaser, and will be proud to restore it to\nyou, by such conveyance as you may hereafter see fit to appoint.\n\n\"From hence I go, Madame, to engage, to-morrow morning, his Majesty's\nship, Drake, of twenty guns, now lying at Carrickfergus. I should meet\nthe enemy with more than wonted resolution, could I flatter myself that,\nthrough this unhandsome conduct on the part of my officers, I lie not\nunder the disesteem of the sweet lady of the Isle of St. Mary's. But\nunconquerable as Mars should I be, could but dare to dream, that in some\ngreen retreat of her charming domain, the Countess of Selkirk offers up a\ncharitable prayer for, my dear lady countess, one, who coming to take a\ncaptive, himself has been captivated.\n\n\"Your ladyship's adoring enemy,\n\n\"JOHN PAUL JONES.\"\n\nHow the lady received this super-ardent note, history does not relate.\nBut history has not omitted to record, that after the return of the\nRanger to France, through the assiduous efforts of Paul in buying up\nthe booty, piece by piece, from the clutches of those among whom it had\nbeen divided, and not without a pecuniary private loss to himself, equal\nto the total value of the plunder, the plate was punctually restored,\neven to the silver heads of two pepper-boxes; and, not only this, but\nthe Earl, hearing all the particulars, magnanimously wrote Paul a\nletter, expressing thanks for his politeness. In the opinion of the\nnoble Earl, Paul was a man of honor. It were rash to differ in opinion\nwith such high-born authority.\n\nUpon returning to the ship, she was instantly pointed over towards the\nIrish coast. Next morning Carrickfergus was in sight. Paul would have\ngone straight in; but Israel, reconnoitring with his glass, informed him\nthat a large ship, probably the Drake, was just coming out.\n\n\"What think you, Israel, do they know who we are? Let me have the\nglass.\"\n\n\"They are dropping a boat now, sir,\" replied Israel, removing the glass\nfrom his eye, and handing it to Paul.\n\n\"So they are--so they are. They don't know us. I'll decoy that boat\nalongside. Quick--they are coming for us--take the helm now yourself, my\nlion, and keep the ship's stern steadily presented towards the advancing\nboat. Don't let them have the least peep at our broadside.\"\n\nThe boat came on, an officer in its bow all the time eyeing the Ranger\nthrough a glass. Presently the boat was within hail.\n\n\"Ship ahoy! Who are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, come alongside,\" answered Paul through his trumpet, in a rapid\noff-hand tone, as though he were a gruff sort of friend, impatient at\nbeing suspected for a foe.\n\nIn a few moments the officer of the boat stepped into the Ranger's\ngangway. Cocking his bonnet gallantly, Paul advanced towards him, making\na very polite bow, saying: \"Good morning, sir, good morning; delighted\nto see you. That's a pretty sword you have; pray, let me look at it.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the officer, glancing at the ship's armament, and turning\npale, \"I am your prisoner.\"\n\n\"No--my guest,\" responded Paul, winningly. \"Pray, let me relieve you of\nyour--your--cane.\"\n\nThus humorously he received the officer's delivered sword.\n\n\"Now tell me, sir, if you please,\" he continued, \"what brings out his\nMajesty's ship Drake this fine morning? Going a little airing?\"\n\n\"She comes out in search of you, but when I left her side half an hour\nsince she did not know that the ship off the harbor was the one she\nsought.\"\n\n\"You had news from Whitehaven, I suppose, last night, eh?\"\n\n\"Aye: express; saying that certain incendiaries had landed there early\nthat morning.\"\n\n\"What?--what sort of men were they, did you say?\" said Paul, shaking his\nbonnet fiercely to one side of his head, and coming close to the\nofficer. \"Pardon me,\" he added derisively, \"I had forgot you are my\n_guest_. Israel, see the unfortunate gentleman below, and his men\nforward.\"\n\nThe Drake was now seen slowly coming out under a light air, attended by\nfive small pleasure-vessels, decorated with flags and streamers, and\nfull of gaily-dressed people, whom motives similar to those which drew\nvisitors to the circus, had induced to embark on their adventurous trip.\nBut they little dreamed how nigh the desperate enemy was.\n\n\"Drop the captured boat astern,\" said Paul; \"see what effect that will\nhave on those merry voyagers.\"\n\nNo sooner was the empty boat descried by the pleasure-vessels than\nforthwith, surmising the truth, they with all diligence turned about and\nre-entered the harbor. Shortly after, alarm-smokes were seen extending\nalong both sides of the channel.\n\n\"They smoke us at last, Captain Paul,\" said Israel.\n\n\"There will be more smoke yet before the day is done,\" replied Paul,\ngravely.\n\nThe wind was right under the land, the tide unfavorable. The Drake\nworked out very slowly.\n\nMeantime, like some fiery-heated duellist calling on urgent business at\nfrosty daybreak, and long kept waiting at the door by the dilatoriness\nof his antagonist, shrinking at the idea of getting up to be cut to\npieces in the cold--the Ranger, with a better breeze, impatiently tacked\nto and fro in the channel. At last, when the English vessel had fairly\nweathered the point, Paul, ranging ahead, courteously led her forth, as\na beau might a belle in a ballroom, to mid-channel, and then suffered\nher to come within hail.\n\n\"She is hoisting her colors now, sir,\" said Israel.\n\n\"Give her the stars and stripes, then, my lad.\"\n\nJoyfully running to the locker, Israel attached the flag to the\nhalyards. The wind freshened. He stood elevated. The bright flag blew\naround him, a glorified shroud, enveloping him in its red ribbons and\nspangles, like up-springing tongues, and sparkles of flame.\n\nAs the colors rose to their final perch, and streamed in the air, Paul\neyed them exultingly.\n\n\"I first hoisted that flag on an American ship, and was the first among\nmen to get it saluted. If I perish this night, the name of Paul Jones\nshall live. Hark! they hail us.\"\n\n\"What ship are you?\"\n\n\"Your enemy. Come on! What wants the fellow of more prefaces and\nintroductions?\"\n\nThe sun was now calmly setting over the green land of Ireland. The sky\nwas serene, the sea smooth, the wind just sufficient to waft the two\nvessels steadily and gently. After the first firing and a little\nmanoeuvring, the two ships glided on freely, side by side; in that mild\nair Exchanging their deadly broadsides, like two friendly horsemen\nwalking their steeds along a plain, chatting as they go. After an hour\nof this running fight, the conversation ended. The Drake struck. How\nchanged from the big craft of sixty short minutes before! She seemed\nnow, above deck, like a piece of wild western woodland into which\nchoppers had been. Her masts and yards prostrate, and hanging in\njack-straws; several of her sails ballooning out, as they dragged in the\nsea, like great lopped tops of foliage. The black hull and shattered\nstumps of masts, galled and riddled, looked as if gigantic woodpeckers\nhad been tapping them.\n\nThe Drake was the larger ship; more cannon; more men. Her loss in killed\nand wounded was far the greater. Her brave captain and lieutenant were\nmortally wounded.\n\nThe former died as the prize was boarded, the latter two days after.\n\nIt was twilight, the weather still severe. No cannonade, naught that mad\nman can do, molests the stoical imperturbability of Nature, when Nature\nchooses to be still. This weather, holding on through the following day,\ngreatly facilitated the refitting of the ships. That done, the two\nvessels, sailing round the north of Ireland, steered towards Brest. They\nwere repeatedly chased by English cruisers, but safely reached their\nanchorage in the French waters.\n\n\"A pretty fair four weeks' yachting, gentlemen,\" said Paul Jones, as the\nRanger swung to her cable, while some French officers boarded her. \"I\nbring two travellers with me, gentlemen,\" he continued. \"Allow me to\nintroduce you to my particular friend Israel Potter, late of North\nAmerica, and also to his Britannic Majesty's ship Drake, late of\nCarrickfergus, Ireland.\"\n\nThis cruise made loud fame for Paul, especially at the court of France,\nwhose king sent Paul, a sword and a medal. But poor Israel, who also had\nconquered a craft, and all unaided too--what had he?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE EXPEDITION THAT SAILED FROM GROIX.\n\n\nThree months after anchoring at Brest, through Dr. Franklin's\nnegotiations with the French king, backed by the bestirring ardor of\nPaul, a squadron of nine vessels, of various force, were ready in the\nroad of Groix for another descent on the British coasts. These craft\nwere miscellaneously picked up, their crews a mongrel pack, the officers\nmostly French, unacquainted with each other, and secretly jealous of\nPaul. The expedition was full of the elements of insubordination and\nfailure. Much bitterness and agony resulted to a spirit like Paul's. But\nhe bore up, and though in many particulars the sequel more than\nwarranted his misgivings, his soul still refused to surrender.\n\nThe career of this stubborn adventurer signally illustrates the idea\nthat since all human affairs are subject to organic disorder, since they\nare created in and sustained by a sort of half-disciplined chaos, hence\nhe who in great things seeks success must never wait for smooth water,\nwhich never was and never will be, but, with what straggling method he\ncan, dash with all his derangements at his object, leaving the rest to\nFortune.\n\nThough nominally commander of the squadron, Paul was not so in effect.\nMost of his captains conceitedly claimed independent commands. One of\nthem in the end proved a traitor outright; few of the rest were\nreliable.\n\nAs for the ships, that commanded by Paul in person will be a good\nexample of the fleet. She was an old Indiaman, clumsy and crank,\nsmelling strongly of the savor of tea, cloves, and arrack, the cargoes\nof former voyages. Even at that day she was, from her venerable\ngrotesqueness, what a cocked hat is, at the present age, among ordinary\nbeavers. Her elephantine bulk was houdahed with a castellated poop like\nthe leaning tower of Pisa. Poor Israel, standing on the top of this\npoop, spy-glass at his eye, looked more an astronomer than a mariner,\nhaving to do, not with the mountains of the billows, but the mountains\nin the moon. Galileo on Fiesole. She was originally a single-decked\nship, that is, carried her armament on one gun-deck; but cutting ports\nbelow, in her after part, Paul rammed out there six old\neighteen-pounders, whose rusty muzzles peered just above the water-line,\nlike a parcel of dirty mulattoes from a cellar-way. Her name was the\nDuras, but, ere sailing, it was changed to that other appellation,\nwhereby this sad old hulk became afterwards immortal. Though it is not\nunknown, that a compliment to Doctor Franklin was involved in this\nchange of titles, yet the secret history of the affair will now for the\nfirst time be disclosed.\n\nIt was evening in the road of Groix. After a fagging day's work, trying\nto conciliate the hostile jealousy of his officers, and provide, in the\nface of endless obstacles (for he had to dance attendance on scores of\nintriguing factors and brokers ashore), the requisite stores for the\nfleet, Paul sat in his cabin in a half-despondent reverie, while Israel,\ncross-legged at his commander's feet, was patching up some old signals.\n\n\"Captain Paul, I don't like our ship's name.--Duras? What's that\nmean?--Duras? Being cribbed up in a ship named Duras! a sort of makes\none feel as if he were in durance vile.\"\n\n\"Gad, I never thought of that before, my lion. Duras--Durance vile. I\nsuppose it's superstition, but I'll change Come, Yellow-mane, what shall\nwe call her?\"\n\n\"Well, Captain Paul, don't you like Doctor Franklin? Hasn't he been the\nprime man to get this fleet together? Let's call her the Doctor\nFranklin.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, that will too publicly declare him just at present; and Poor\nRichard wants to be a little shady in this business.\"\n\n\"Poor Richard!--call her Poor Richard, then,\" cried Israel, suddenly\nstruck by the idea.\n\n\"'Gad, you have it,\" answered Paul, springing to his feet, as all trace\nof his former despondency left him;--\"Poor Richard shall be the name, in\nhonor to the saying, that 'God helps them that help themselves,' as Poor\nRichard says.\"\n\nNow this was the way the craft came to be called the _Bon Homme\nRichard_; for it being deemed advisable to have a French rendering of\nthe new title, it assumed the above form.\n\nA few days after, the force sailed. Ere long, they captured several\nvessels; but the captains of the squadron proving refractory, events\ntook so deplorable a turn, that Paul, for the present, was obliged to\nreturn to Groix. Luckily, however, at this junction a cartel arrived\nfrom England with upwards of a hundred exchanged American seamen, who\nalmost to a man enlisted under the flag of Paul.\n\nUpon the resailing of the force, the old troubles broke out afresh. Most\nof her consorts insubordinately separated from the Bon Homme Richard. At\nlength Paul found himself in violent storms beating off the rugged\nsoutheastern coast of Scotland, with only two accompanying ships. But\nneither the mutiny of his fleet, nor the chaos of the elements, made him\nfalter in his purpose. Nay, at this crisis, he projected the most daring\nof all his descents.\n\nThe Cheviot Hills were in sight. Sundry vessels had been described bound\nin for the Firth of Forth, on whose south shore, well up the Firth,\nstands Leith, the port of Edinburgh, distant but a mile or two from that\ncapital. He resolved to dash at Leith, and lay it under contribution or\nin ashes. He called the captains of his two remaining consorts on board\nhis own ship to arrange details. Those worthies had much of fastidious\nremark to make against the plan. After losing much time in trying to\nbring to a conclusion their sage deliberations, Paul, by addressing\ntheir cupidity, achieved that which all appeals to their gallantry\ncould not accomplish. He proclaimed the grand prize of the Leith lottery\nat no less a figure than \u00c2\u00a3200,000, that being named as the ransom.\nEnough: the three ships enter the Firth, boldly and freely, as if\ncarrying Quakers to a Peace-Congress.\n\nAlong both startled shores the panic of their approach spread like the\ncholera. The three suspicious crafts had so long lain off and on, that\nnone doubted they were led by the audacious viking, Paul Jones. At five\no'clock, on the following morning, they were distinctly seen from the\ncapital of Scotland, quietly sailing up the bay. Batteries were hastily\nthrown up at Leith, arms were obtained from the castle at Edinburgh,\nalarm fires were kindled in all directions. Yet with such tranquillity\nof effrontery did Paul conduct his ships, concealing as much as possible\ntheir warlike character, that more than once his vessels were mistaken\nfor merchantmen, and hailed by passing ships as such.\n\nIn the afternoon, Israel, at his station on the tower of Pisa, reported\na boat with five men coming off to the Richard from the coast of Fife.\n\n\"They have hot oat-cakes for us,\" said Paul; \"let 'em come. To encourage\nthem, show them the English ensign, Israel, my lad.\"\n\nSoon the boat was alongside.\n\n\"Well, my good fellows, what can I do for you this afternoon?\" said\nPaul, leaning over the side with a patronizing air.\n\n\"Why, captain, we come from the Laird of Crokarky, who wants some powder\nand ball for his money.\"\n\n\"What would you with powder and ball, pray?\"\n\n\"Oh! haven't you heard that that bloody pirate, Paul Jones, is somewhere\nhanging round the coasts?\"\n\n\"Aye, indeed, but he won't hurt you. He's only going round among the\nnations, with his old hat, taking up contributions. So, away with ye; ye\ndon't want any powder and ball to give him. He wants contributions of\nsilver, not lead. Prepare yourselves with silver, I say.\"\n\n\"Nay, captain, the Laird ordered us not to return without powder and\nball. See, here is the price. It may be the taking of the bloody pirate,\nif you let us have what we want.\"\n\n\"Well, pass 'em over a keg,\" said Paul, laughing, but modifying his\norder by a sly whisper to Israel: \"Oh, put up your price, it's a gift to\nye.\"\n\n\"But ball, captain; what's the use of powder without ball?\" roared one\nof the fellows from the boat's bow, as the keg was lowered in. \"We want\nball.\"\n\n\"Bless my soul, you bawl loud enough as it is. Away with ye, with what\nyou have. Look to your keg, and hark ye, if ye catch that villain, Paul\nJones, give him no quarter.\"\n\n\"But, captain, here,\" shouted one of the boatmen, \"there's a mistake.\nThis is a keg of pickles, not powder. Look,\" and poking into the\nbung-hole, he dragged out a green cucumber dripping with brine. \"Take\nthis back, and give us the powder.\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" said Paul, \"the powder is at the bottom, pickled powder, best\nway to keep it. Away with ye, now, and after that bloody embezzler, Paul\nJones.\"\n\nThis was Sunday. The ships held on. During the afternoon, a long tack\nof the Richard brought her close towards the shores of Fife, near the\nthriving little port of Kirkaldy.\n\n\"There's a great crowd on the beach. Captain Paul,\" said Israel, looking\nthrough his glass. \"There seems to be an old woman standing on a\nfish-barrel there, a sort of selling things at auction to the people,\nbut I can't be certain yet.\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" said Paul, taking the glass as they came nigher. \"Sure\nenough, it's an old lady--an old quack-doctress, seems to me, in a black\ngown, too. I must hail her.\"\n\nOrdering the ship to be kept on towards the port, he shortened sail\nwithin easy distance, so as to glide slowly by, and seizing the trumpet,\nthus spoke:\n\n\"Old lady, ahoy! What are you talking about? What's your text?\"\n\n\"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance. He shall wash\nhis feet in the blood of the wicked.\"\n\n\"Ah, what a lack of charity. Now hear mine:--God helpeth them that help\nthemselves, as Poor Richard says.\"\n\n\"Reprobate pirate, a gale shall yet come to drive thee in wrecks from\nour waters.\"\n\n\"The strong wind of your hate fills my sails well. Adieu,\" waving his\nbonnet--\"tell us the rest at Leith.\"\n\nNext morning the ships were almost within cannon-shot of the town. The\nmen to be landed were in the boats. Israel had the tiller of the\nforemost one, waiting for his commander to enter, when just as Paul's\nfoot was on the gangway, a sudden squall struck all three ships, dashing\nthe boats against them, and causing indescribable confusion. The squall\nended in a violent gale. Getting his men on board with all dispatch,\nPaul essayed his best to withstand the fury of the wind, but it blew\nadversely, and with redoubled power. A ship at a distance went down\nbeneath it. The disappointed invader was obliged to turn before the\ngale, and renounce his project.\n\nTo this hour, on the shores of the Firth of Forth, it is the popular\npersuasion, that the Rev. Mr. Shirrer's (of Kirkaldy) powerful\nintercession was the direct cause of the elemental repulse experienced\noff the endangered harbor of Leith.\n\nThrough the ill qualities of Paul's associate captains: their timidity,\nincapable of keeping pace with his daring; their jealousy, blind to his\nsuperiority to rivalship; together with the general reduction of his\nforce, now reduced by desertion, from nine to three ships; and last of\nall, the enmity of seas and winds; the invader, driven, not by a fleet,\nbut a gale, out of the Scottish water's, had the mortification in\nprospect of terminating a cruise, so formidable in appearance at the\nonset, without one added deed to sustain the reputation gained by former\nexploits. Nevertheless, he was not disheartened. He sought to conciliate\nfortune, not by despondency, but by resolution. And, as if won by his\nconfident bearing, that fickle power suddenly went over to him from the\nranks of the enemy--suddenly as plumed Marshal Ney to the stubborn\nstandard of Napoleon from Elba, marching regenerated on Paris. In a\nword, luck--that's the word--shortly threw in Paul's way the great\naction of his life: the most extraordinary of all naval engagements; the\nunparalleled death-lock with the Serapis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHEY FIGHT THE SERAPIS.\n\n\nThe battle between the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis stands in\nhistory as the first signal collision on the sea between the Englishman\nand the American. For obstinacy, mutual hatred, and courage, it is\nwithout precedent or subsequent in the story of ocean. The strife long\nhung undetermined, but the English flag struck in the end.\n\nThere would seem to be something singularly indicatory in this\nengagement. It may involve at once a type, a parallel, and a prophecy.\nSharing the same blood with England, and yet her proved foe in two\nwars--not wholly inclined at bottom to forget an old grudge--intrepid,\nunprincipled, reckless, predatory, with boundless ambition, civilized in\nexternals but a savage at heart, America is, or may yet be, the Paul\nJones of nations.\n\nRegarded in this indicatory light, the battle between the Bon Homme\nRichard and the Serapis--in itself so curious--may well enlist our\ninterest.\n\nNever was there a fight so snarled. The intricacy of those incidents\nwhich defy the narrator's extrication, is not illy figured in that\nbewildering intertanglement of all the yards and anchors of the two\nships, which confounded them for the time in one chaos of devastation.\n\nElsewhere than here the reader must go who seeks an elaborate version of\nthe fight, or, indeed, much of any regular account of it whatever. The\nwriter is but brought to mention the battle because he must needs\nfollow, in all events, the fortunes of the humble adventurer whose life\nlie records. Yet this necessarily involves some general view of each\nconspicuous incident in which he shares.\n\nSeveral circumstances of the place and time served to invest the fight\nwith a certain scenic atmosphere casting a light almost poetic over the\nwild gloom of its tragic results. The battle was fought between the\nhours of seven and ten at night; the height of it was under a full\nharvest moon, in view of thousands of distant spectators crowning the\nhigh cliffs of Yorkshire.\n\nFrom the Tees to the Humber, the eastern coast of Britain, for the most\npart, wears a savage, melancholy, and Calabrian aspect. It is in course\nof incessant decay. Every year the isle which repulses nearly all other\nfoes, succumbs to the Attila assaults of the deep. Here and there the\nbase of the cliffs is strewn with masses of rock, undermined by the\nwaves, and tumbled headlong below, where, sometimes, the water\ncompletely surrounds them, showing in shattered confusion detached\nrocks, pyramids, and obelisks, rising half-revealed from the surf--the\nTadmores of the wasteful desert of the sea. Nowhere is this desolation\nmore marked than for those fifty miles of coast between Flamborough Head\nand the Spurm.\n\nWeathering out the gale which had driven them from Leith, Paul's ships\nfor a few days were employed in giving chase to various merchantmen and\ncolliers; capturing some, sinking others, and putting the rest to\nflight. Off the mouth of the Humber they ineffectually manoeuvred with a\nview of drawing out a king's frigate, reported to be lying at anchor\nwithin. At another time a large fleet was encountered, under convoy of\nsome ships of force. But their panic caused the fleet to hug the edge of\nperilous shoals very nigh the land, where, by reason of his having no\ncompetent pilot, Paul durst not approach to molest them. The same night\nhe saw two strangers further out at sea, and chased them until three in\nthe morning, when, getting pretty nigh, he surmised that they must needs\nbe vessels of his own squadron, which, previous to his entering the\nFirth of Forth, had separated from his command. Daylight proved this\nsupposition correct. Five vessels of the original squadron were now once\nmore in company. About noon a fleet of forty merchantmen appeared coming\nround Flamborough Head, protected by two English man-of-war, the Serapis\nand Countess of Scarborough. Descrying the five cruisers sailing down,\nthe forty sail, like forty chickens, fluttered in a panic under the wing\nof the shore. Their armed protectors bravely steered from the land,\nmaking the disposition for battle. Promptly accepting the challenge,\nPaul, giving the signal to his consorts, earnestly pressed forward. But,\nearnest as he was, it was seven in the evening ere the encounter began.\nMeantime his comrades, heedless of his signals, sailed independently\nalong. Dismissing them from present consideration, we confine ourselves,\nfor a while, to the Richard and the Serapis, the grand duellists of the\nfight.\n\nThe Richard carried a motley, crew, to keep whom in order one hundred\nand thirty-five soldiers--themselves a hybrid band--had been put on\nboard, commanded by French officers of inferior rank. Her armament was\nsimilarly heterogeneous; guns of all sorts and calibres; but about equal\non the whole to those of a thirty-two-gun frigate. The spirit of baneful\nintermixture pervaded this craft throughout.\n\nThe Serapis was a frigate of fifty guns, more than half of which\nindividually exceeded in calibre any one gun of the Richard. She had a\ncrew of some three hundred and twenty trained man-of-war's men.\n\nThere is something in a naval engagement which radically distinguishes\nit from one on the land. The ocean, at times, has what is called its\n_sea_ and its _trough of the sea_; but it has neither rivers, woods,\nbanks, towns, nor mountains. In mild weather it is one hammered plain.\nStratagems, like those of disciplined armies--ambuscades, like those of\nIndians, are impossible. All is clear, open, fluent. The very element\nwhich sustains the combatants, yields at the stroke of a feather. One\nwind and one tide at one time operate upon all who here engage. This\nsimplicity renders a battle between two men-of-war, with their huge\nwhite wings, more akin to the Miltonic contests of archangels than to\n_the comparatively squalid_ tussles of earth.\n\nAs the ships neared, a hazy darkness overspread the water. The moon was\nnot yet risen. Objects were perceived with difficulty. Borne by a soft\nmoist breeze over gentle waves, they came within pistol-shot. Owing to\nthe obscurity, and the known neighborhood of other vessels, the Serapis\nwas uncertain who the Richard was. Through the dim mist each ship loomed\nforth to the other vast, but indistinct, as the ghost of Morven. Sounds\nof the trampling of resolute men echoed from either hull, whose tight\ndecks dully resounded like drum-heads in a funeral march.\n\nThe Serapis hailed. She was answered by a broadside. For half an hour\nthe combatants deliberately manoeuvred, continually changing their\nposition, but always within shot fire. The. Serapis--the better sailer\nof the two--kept critically circling the Richard, making lounging\nadvances now and then, and as suddenly steering off; hate causing her to\nact not unlike a wheeling cock about a hen, when stirred by the contrary\npassion. Meantime, though within easy speaking distance, no further\nsyllable was exchanged; but an incessant cannonade was kept up.\n\nAt this point, a third party, the Scarborough, drew near, seemingly\ndesirous of giving assistance to her consort. But thick smoke was now\nadded to the night's natural obscurity. The Scarborough imperfectly\ndiscerned two ships, and plainly saw the common fire they made; but\nwhich was which, she could not tell. Eager to befriend the Serapis, she\ndurst not fire a gun, lest she might unwittingly act the part of a foe.\nAs when a hawk and a crow are clawing and beaking high in the air, a\nsecond crow flying near, will seek to join the battle, but finding no\nfair chance to engage, at last flies away to the woods; just so did the\nScarborough now. Prudence dictated the step; because several chance\nshot--from which of the combatants could not be known--had already\nstruck the Scarborough. So, unwilling uselessly to expose herself, off\nwent for the present this baffled and ineffectual friend.\n\nNot long after, an invisible hand came and set down a great yellow lamp\nin the east. The hand reached up unseen from below the horizon, and set\nthe lamp down right on the rim of the horizon, as on a threshold; as\nmuch as to say, Gentlemen warriors, permit me a little to light up this\nrather gloomy looking subject. The lamp was the round harvest moon; the\none solitary foot-light of the scene. But scarcely did the rays from the\nlamp pierce that languid haze. Objects before perceived with difficulty,\nnow glimmered ambiguously. Bedded in strange vapors, the great\nfoot-light cast a dubious, half demoniac glare across the waters, like\nthe phantasmagoric stream sent athwart a London flagging in a night-rain\nfrom an apothecary's blue and green window. Through this sardonical\nmist, the face of the Man-in-the-Moon--looking right towards the\ncombatants, as if he were standing in a trap-door of the sea, leaning\nforward leisurely with his arms complacently folded over upon the edge\nof the horizon--this queer face wore a serious, apishly self-satisfied\nleer, as if the Man-in-the-Moon had somehow secretly put up the ships\nto their contest, and in the depths of his malignant old soul was not\nunpleased to see how well his charms worked. There stood the grinning\nMan-in-the-Moon, his head just dodging into view over the rim of the\nsea:--Mephistopheles prompter of the stage.\n\nAided now a little by the planet, one of the consorts of the Richard,\nthe Pallas, hovering far outside the fight, dimly discerned the\nsuspicious form of a lonely vessel unknown to her. She resolved to\nengage it, if it proved a foe. But ere they joined, the unknown\nship--which proved to be the Scarborough--received a broadside at long\ngun's distance from another consort of the Richard the Alliance. The\nshot whizzed across the broad interval like shuttlecocks across a great\nhall. Presently the battledores of both batteries were at work, and\nrapid compliments of shuttlecocks were very promptly exchanged. The\nadverse consorts of the two main belligerents fought with all the rage\nof those fiery seconds who in some desperate duels make their\nprincipal's quarrel their own. Diverted from the Richard and the Serapis\nby this little by-play, the Man-in-the-Moon, all eager to see what it\nwas, somewhat raised himself from his trap-door with an added grin on\nhis face. By this time, off sneaked the Alliance, and down swept the\nPallas, at close quarters engaging the Scarborough; an encounter\ndestined in less than an hour to end in the latter ship's striking her\nflag.\n\nCompared to the Serapis and the Richard, the Pallas and the Scarborough\nwere as two pages to two knights. In their immature way they showed the\nsame traits as their fully developed superiors.\n\nThe Man-in-the-Moon now raised himself still higher to obtain a better\nview of affairs.\n\nBut the Man-in-the-Moon was not the only spectator. From the high cliffs\nof the shore, and especially from the great promontory of Flamborough\nHead, the scene was witnessed by crowds of the islanders. Any rustic\nmight be pardoned his curiosity in view of the spectacle, presented. Far\nin the indistinct distance fleets of frightened merchantmen filled the\nlower air with their sails, as flakes of snow in a snow-storm by night.\nHovering undeterminedly, in another direction, were several of the\nscattered consorts of Paul, taking no part in the fray. Nearer, was an\nisolated mist, investing the Pallas and Scarborough--a mist slowly\nadrift on the sea, like a floating isle, and at intervals irradiated\nwith sparkles of fire and resonant with the boom of cannon. Further\naway, in the deeper water, was a lurid cloud, incessantly torn in shreds\nof lightning, then fusing together again, once more to be rent. As yet\nthis lurid cloud was neither stationary nor slowly adrift, like the\nfirst-mentioned one; but, instinct with chaotic vitality, shifted hither\nand thither, foaming with fire, like a valiant water-spout careering off\nthe coast of Malabar.\n\nTo get some idea of the events enacting in that cloud, it will be\nnecessary to enter it; to go and possess it, as a ghost may rush into a\nbody, or the devils into the swine, which running down the steep place\nperished in the sea; just as the Richard is yet to do.\n\nThus far the Serapis and the Richard had been manoeuvring and chasing\nto each other like partners in a cotillion, all the time indulging in\nrapid repartee.\n\nBut finding at last that the superior managableness of the enemy's ship\nenabled him to get the better of the clumsy old Indiaman, the Richard,\nin taking position, Paul, with his wonted resolution, at once sought to\nneutralize this, by hugging him close. But the attempt to lay the\nRichard right across the head of the Serapis ended quite otherwise, in\nsending the enemy's jib-boom just over the Richard's great tower of\nPisa, where Israel was stationed; who, catching it eagerly, stood for an\ninstant holding to the slack of the sail, like one grasping a horse by\nthe mane prior to vaulting into the saddle.\n\n\"Aye, hold hard, lad,\" cried Paul, springing to his side with a coil of\nrigging. With a few rapid turns he knitted himself to his foe. The wind\nnow acting on the sails of the Serapis forced her, heel and point, her\nentire length, cheek by jowl, alongside the Richard. The projecting\ncannon scraped; the yards interlocked; but the hulls did not touch. A\nlong lane of darkling water lay wedged between, like that narrow canal\nin Venice which dozes between two shadowy piles, and high in air is\nsecretly crossed by the Bridge of Sighs. But where the six yard-arms\nreciprocally arched overhead, three bridges of sighs were both seen and\nheard, as the moon and wind kept rising.\n\nInto that Lethean canal--pond-like in its smoothness as compared with\nthe sea without--fell many a poor soul that night; fell, forever\nforgotten.\n\nAs some heaving rent coinciding with a disputed frontier on a volcanic\nplain, that boundary abyss was the jaws of death to both sides. So\ncontracted was it, that in many cases the gun-rammers had to be thrust\ninto the opposite ports, in order to enter to muzzles of their own\ncannon. It seemed more an intestine feud, than a fight between\nstrangers. Or, rather, it was as if the Siamese Twins, oblivious of\ntheir fraternal bond, should rage in unnatural fight.\n\nEre long, a horrible explosion was heard, drowning for the instant the\ncannonade. Two of the old eighteen-pounders--before spoken of, as having\nbeen hurriedly set up below the main deck of the Richard--burst all to\npieces, killing the sailors who worked them, and shattering all that\npart of the hull, as if two exploded steam-boilers had shot out of its\nopposite sides. The effect was like the fall of the walls of a house.\nLittle now upheld the great tower of Pisa but a few naked crow\nstanchions. Thenceforth, not a few balls from the Serapis must have\npassed straight through the Richard without grazing her. It was like\nfiring buck-shot through the ribs of a skeleton.\n\nBut, further forward, so deadly was the broadside from the heavy\nbatteries of the Serapis--levelled point-blank, and right down the\nthroat and bowels, as it were, of the Richard--that it cleared\neverything before it. The men on the Richard's covered gun-deck ran\nabove, like miners from the fire-damp. Collecting on the forecastle,\nthey continued to fight with grenades and muskets. The soldiers also\nwere in the lofty tops, whence they kept up incessant volleys, cascading\ntheir fire down as pouring lava from cliffs.\n\nThe position of the men in the two ships was now exactly reversed. For\nwhile the Serapis was tearing the Richard all to pieces below deck, and\nhad swept that covered part almost of the last man, the Richard's crowd\nof musketry had complete control of the upper deck of the Serapis, where\nit was almost impossible for man to remain unless as a corpse. Though in\nthe beginning, the tops of the Serapis had not been unsupplied with\nmarksmen, yet they had long since been cleared by the overmastering\nmusketry of the Richard. Several, with leg or arm broken by a ball, had\nbeen seen going dimly downward from their giddy perch, like falling\npigeons shot on the wing.\n\nAs busy swallows about barn-eaves and ridge-poles, some of the Richard's\nmarksmen, quitting their tops, now went far out on their yard-arms,\nwhere they overhung the Serapis. From thence they dropped hand-grenades\nupon her decks, like apples, which growing in one field fall over the\nfence into another. Others of their band flung the same sour fruit into\nthe open ports of the Serapis. A hail-storm of aerial combustion\ndescended and slanted on the Serapis, while horizontal thunderbolts\nrolled crosswise through the subterranean vaults of the Richard. The\nbelligerents were no longer, in the ordinary sense of things, an English\nship and an American ship. It was a co-partnership and joint-stock\ncombustion-company of both ships; yet divided, even in participation.\nThe two vessels were as two houses, through whose party-wall doors have\nbeen cut; one family (the Guelphs) occupying the whole lower story;\nanother family (the Ghibelines) the whole upper story.\n\nMeanwhile, determined Paul flew hither and thither like the meteoric\ncorposant-ball, which shiftingly dances on the tips and verges of ships'\nrigging in storms. Wherever he went, he seemed to cast a pale light on\nall faces. Blacked and burnt, his Scotch bonnet was compressed to a\ngun-wad on his head. His Parisian coat, with its gold-laced sleeve laid\naside, disclosed to the full the blue tattooing on his arm, which\nsometimes in fierce gestures streamed in the haze of the cannonade,\ncabalistically terrific as the charmed standard of Satan. Yet his\nfrenzied manner was less a testimony of his internal commotion than\nintended to inspirit and madden his men, some of whom seeing him, in\ntransports of intrepidity stripped themselves to their trowsers,\nexposing their naked bodies to the as naked shot The same was done on\nthe Serapis, where several guns were seen surrounded by their buff crews\nas by fauns and satyrs.\n\nAt the beginning of the fray, before the ships interlocked, in the\nintervals of smoke which swept over the ships as mist over\nmountain-tops, affording open rents here and there--the gun-deck of the\nSerapis, at certain points, showed, congealed for the instant in all\nattitudes of dauntlessness, a gallery of marble statues--fighting\ngladiators.\n\nStooping low and intent, with one braced leg thrust behind, and one arm\nthrust forward, curling round towards the muzzle of the gun, there was\nseen the _loader_, performing his allotted part; on the other side of\nthe carriage, in the same stooping posture, but with both hands holding\nhis long black pole, pike-wise, ready for instant use--stood the eager\n_rammer and sponger_; while at the breech, crouched the wary _captain of\nthe gun_, his keen eye, like the watching leopard's, burning along the\nrange; and behind all, tall and erect, the Egyptian symbol of death,\nstood the _matchman_, immovable for the moment, his long-handled match\nreversed. Up to their two long death-dealing batteries, the trained men\nof the Serapis stood and toiled in mechanical magic of discipline. They\ntended those rows of guns, as Lowell girls the rows of looms in a cotton\nfactory. The Parcae were not more methodical; Atropos not more fatal;\nthe automaton chess-player not more irresponsible.\n\n\"Look, lad; I want a grenade, now, thrown down their main hatchway. I\nsaw long piles of cartridges there. The powder monkeys have brought them\nup faster than they can be used. Take a bucket of combustibles, and\nlet's hear from you presently.\"\n\nThese words were spoken by Paul to Israel. Israel did as ordered. In a\nfew minutes, bucket in hand, begrimed with powder, sixty feet in air, he\nhung like Apollyon from the extreme tip of the yard over the fated abyss\nof the hatchway. As he looked down between the eddies of smoke into that\nslaughterous pit, it was like looking from the verge of a cataract down\ninto the yeasty pool at its base. Watching, his chance, he dropped one\ngrenade with such faultless precision, that, striking its mark, an\nexplosion rent the Serapis like a volcano. The long row of heaped\ncartridges was ignited. The fire ran horizontally, like an express on a\nrailway. More than twenty men were instantly killed: nearly forty\nwounded. This blow restored the chances of battle, before in favor of\nthe Serapis.\n\nBut the drooping spirits of the English were suddenly revived, by an\nevent which crowned the scene by an act on the part of one of the\nconsorts of the Richard, the incredible atrocity of which has induced\nall humane minds to impute it rather to some incomprehensible mistake\nthan to the malignant madness of the perpetrator.\n\nThe cautious approach and retreat of a consort of the Serapis, the\nScarborough, before the moon rose, has already been mentioned. It is now\nto be related how that, when the moon was more than an hour high, a\nconsort of the Richard, the Alliance, likewise approached and retreated.\nThis ship, commanded by a Frenchman, infamous in his own navy, and\nobnoxious in the service to which he at present belonged; this ship,\nforemost in insurgency to Paul hitherto, and which, for the most part,\nhad crept like a poltroon from the fray; the Alliance now was at hand.\nSeeing her, Paul deemed the battle at an end. But to his horror, the\nAlliance threw a broadside full into the stern of the Richard, without\ntouching the Serapis. Paul called to her, for God's sake to forbear\ndestroying the Richard. The reply was, a second, a third, a fourth\nbroadside, striking the Richard ahead, astern, and amidships. One of the\nvolleys killed several men and one officer. Meantime, like carpenters'\naugers, and the sea-worm called Remora, the guns of the Serapis were\ndrilling away at the same doomed hull. After performing her nameless\nexploit, the Alliance sailed away, and did no more. She was like the\ngreat fire of London, breaking out on the heel of the great Plague. By\nthis time, the Richard had so many shot-holes low down in her hull, that\nlike a sieve she began to settle.\n\n\"Do you strike?\" cried the English captain.\n\n\"I have not yet begun to fight,\" howled sinking Paul.\n\nThis summons and response were whirled on eddies of smoke and flame.\nBoth vessels were now on fire. The men of either knew hardly which to\ndo; strive to destroy the enemy, or save themselves. In the midst of\nthis, one hundred human beings, hitherto invisible strangers, were\nsuddenly added to the rest. Five score English prisoners, till now\nconfined in the Richard's hold, liberated in his consternation by the\nmaster at arms, burst up the hatchways. One of them, the captain of a\nletter of marque, captured by Paul, off the Scottish coast, crawled\nthrough a port, as a burglar through a window, from the one ship to the\nother, and reported affairs to the English captain.\n\nWhile Paul and his lieutenants were confronting these prisoners, the\ngunner, running up from below, and not perceiving his official\nsuperiors, and deeming them dead, believing himself now left sole\nsurviving officer, ran to the tower of Pisa to haul down the colors. But\nthey were already shot down and trailing in the water astern, like a\nsailor's towing shirt. Seeing the gunner there, groping about in the\nsmoke, Israel asked what he wanted.\n\nAt this moment the gunner, rushing to the rail, shouted \"Quarter!\nquarter!\" to the Serapis.\n\n\"I'll quarter ye,\" yelled Israel, smiting the gunner with the flat of\nhis cutlass.\n\n\"Do you strike?\" now came from the Serapis.\n\n\"Aye, aye, aye!\" involuntarily cried Israel, fetching the gunner a\nshower of blows.\n\n\"Do you strike?\" again was repeated from the Serapis; whose captain,\njudging from the augmented confusion on board the Richard, owing to the\nescape of the prisoners, and also influenced by the report made to him\nby his late guest of the port-hole, doubted not that the enemy must\nneeds be about surrendering.\n\n\"Do you strike?\"\n\n\"Aye!--I strike _back_\" roared Paul, for the first time now hearing the\nsummons.\n\nBut judging this frantic response to come, like the others, from some\nunauthorized source, the English captain directed his boarders to be\ncalled, some of whom presently leaped on the Richard's rail, but,\nthrowing out his tattooed arm at them, with a sabre at the end of it,\nPaul showed them how boarders repelled boarders. The English retreated,\nbut not before they had been thinned out again, like spring radishes, by\nthe unfaltering fire from the Richard's tops.\n\nAn officer of the Richard, seeing the mass of prisoners delirious with\nsudden liberty and fright, pricked them with his sword to the pumps,\nthus keeping the ship afloat by the very blunder which had promised to\nhave been fatal. The vessels now blazed so in the rigging that both\nparties desisted from hostilities to subdue the common foe.\n\nWhen some faint order was again restored upon the Richard her chances of\nvictory increased, while those of the English, driven under cover,\nproportionably waned. Early in the contest, Paul, with his own hand, had\nbrought one of his largest guns to bear against the enemy's mainmast.\nThat shot had hit. The mast now plainly tottered. Nevertheless, it\nseemed as if, in this fight, neither party could be victor. Mutual\nobliteration from the face of the waters seemed the only natural sequel\nto hostilities like these. It is, therefore, honor to him as a man, and\nnot reproach to him as an officer, that, to stay such carnage, Captain\nPearson, of the Serapis, with his own hands hauled down his colors. But\njust as an officer from the Richard swung himself on board the Serapis,\nand accosted the English captain, the first lieutenant of the Serapis\ncame up from below inquiring whether the Richard had struck, since her\nfire had ceased.\n\nSo equal was the conflict that, even after the surrender, it could be,\nand was, a question to one of the warriors engaged (who had not happened\nto see the English flag hauled down) whether the Serapis had struck to\nthe Richard, or the Richard to the Serapis. Nay, while the Richard's\nofficer was still amicably conversing with the English captain, a\nmidshipman of the Richard, in act of following his superior on board the\nsurrendered vessel, was run through the thigh by a pike in the hand of\nan ignorant boarder of the Serapis. While, equally ignorant, the\ncannons below deck were still thundering away at the nominal conqueror\nfrom the batteries of the nominally conquered ship.\n\nBut though the Serapis had submitted, there were two misanthropical foes\non board the Richard which would not so easily succumb--fire and water.\nAll night the victors were engaged in suppressing the flames. Not until\ndaylight were the flames got under; but though the pumps were kept\ncontinually going, the water in the hold still gained. A few hours after\nsunrise the Richard was deserted for the Serapis and the other vessels\nof the squadron of Paul. About ten o'clock the Richard, gorged with\nslaughter, wallowed heavily, gave a long roll, and blasted by tornadoes\nof sulphur, slowly sunk, like Gomorrah, out of sight.\n\nThe loss of life in the two ships was about equal; one-half of the total\nnumber of those engaged being either killed or wounded.\n\nIn view of this battle one may ask--What separates the enlightened man\nfrom the savage? Is civilization a thing distinct, or is it an advanced\nstage of barbarism?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE SHUTTLE.\n\n\nFor a time back, across the otherwise blue-jean career of Israel, Paul\nJones flits and re-flits like a crimson thread. One more brief\nintermingling of it, and to the plain old homespun we return.\n\nThe battle won, the squadron started for the Texel, where they arrived\nin safety. Omitting all mention of intervening harassments, suffice it,\nthat after some months of inaction as to anything of a warlike nature,\nPaul and Israel (both, from different motives, eager to return to\nAmerica) sailed for that country in the armed ship Ariel, Paul as\ncommander, Israel as quartermaster.\n\nTwo weeks out, they encountered by night a frigate-like craft, supposed\nto be an enemy. The vessels came within hail, both showing English\ncolors, with purposes of mutual deception, affecting to belong to the\nEnglish Navy. For an hour, through their speaking trumpets, the captains\nequivocally conversed. A very reserved, adroit, hoodwinking,\nstatesman-like conversation, indeed. At last, professing some little\nincredulity as to the truthfulness of the stranger's statement, Paul\nintimated a desire that he should put out a boat and come on board to\nshow his commission, to which the stranger very affably replied, that\nunfortunately his boat was exceedingly leaky. With equal politeness,\nPaul begged him to consider the danger attending a refusal, which\nrejoinder nettled the other, who suddenly retorted that he would answer\nfor twenty guns, and that both himself and men were knock-down\nEnglishmen. Upon this, Paul said that he would allow him exactly five\nminutes for a sober, second thought. That brief period passed, Paul,\nhoisting the American colors, ran close under the other ship's stern,\nand engaged her. It was about eight o'clock at night that this strange\nquarrel was picked in the middle of the ocean. Why cannot men be\npeaceable on that great common? Or does nature in those fierce\nnight-brawlers, the billows, set mankind but a sorry example?\n\nAfter ten minutes' cannonading, the stranger struck, shouting out that\nhalf his men were killed. The Ariel's crew hurrahed. Boarders were\ncalled to take possession. At this juncture, the prize shifting her\nposition so that she headed away, and to leeward of the Ariel, thrust\nher long spanker-boom diagonally over the latter's quarter; when Israel,\nwho was standing close by, instinctively caught hold of it--just as he\nhad grasped the jib-boom of the Serapis--and, at the same moment,\nhearing the call to take possession, in the valiant excitement of the\noccasion, he leaped upon the spar, and made a rush for the stranger's\ndeck, thinking, of course, that he would be immediately followed by the\nregular boarders. But the sails of the strange ship suddenly filled;\nshe began to glide through the sea; her spanker-boom, not having at all\nentangled itself, offering no hindrance. Israel, clinging midway along\nthe boom, soon found himself divided from the Ariel by a space\nimpossible to be leaped. Meantime, suspecting foul play, Paul set every\nsail; but the stranger, having already the advantage, contrived to make\ngood her escape, though perseveringly chased by the cheated conqueror.\n\nIn the confusion, no eye had observed our hero's spring. But, as the\nvessels separated more, an officer of the strange ship spying a man on\nthe boom, and taking him for one of his own men, demanded what he did\nthere.\n\n\"Clearing the signal halyards, sir,\" replied Israel, fumbling with the\ncord which happened to be dangling near by.\n\n\"Well, bear a hand and come in, or you will have a bow-chaser at you\nsoon,\" referring to the bow guns of the Ariel.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Israel, and in a moment he sprang to the deck, and\nsoon found himself mixed in among some two hundred English sailors of a\nlarge letter of marque. At once he perceived that the story of half the\ncrew being killed was a mere hoax, played off for the sake of making an\nescape. Orders were continually being given to pull on this and that\nrope, as the ship crowded all sail in flight. To these orders Israel,\nwith the rest, promptly responded, pulling at the rigging stoutly as the\nbest of them; though Heaven knows his heart sunk deeper and deeper at\nevery pull which thus helped once again to widen the gulf between him\nand home.\n\nIn intervals he considered with himself what to do. Favored by the\nobscurity of the night and the number of the crew, and wearing much the\nsame dress as theirs, it was very easy to pass himself off for one of\nthem till morning. But daylight would be sure to expose him, unless some\ncunning, plan could be hit upon. If discovered for what he was, nothing\nshort of a prison awaited him upon the ship's arrival in port.\n\nIt was a desperate case, only as desperate a remedy could serve. One\nthing was sure, he could not hide. Some audacious parade of himself\npromised the only hope. Marking that the sailors, not being of the\nregular navy, wore no uniform, and perceiving that his jacket was the\nonly garment on him which bore any distinguishing badge, our adventurer\ntook it off, and privily dropped it overboard, remaining now in his dark\nblue woollen shirt and blue cloth waistcoat.\n\nWhat the more inspirited Israel to the added step now contemplated, was\nthe circumstance that the ship was not a Frenchman's or other foreigner,\nbut her crew, though enemies, spoke the same language that he did.\n\nSo very quietly, at last, he goes aloft into the maintop, and sitting\ndown on an old sail there, beside some eight or ten topmen, in an\noff-handed way asks one for tobacco.\n\n\"Give us a quid, lad,\" as he settled himself in his seat.\n\n\"Halloo,\" said the strange sailor, \"who be you? Get out of the top! The\nfore and mizzentop men won't let us go into their tops, and blame me if\nwe'll let any of their gangs come here. So, away ye go.\"\n\n\"You're blind, or crazy, old boy,\" rejoined Israel. \"I'm a topmate;\nain't I, lads?\" appealing to the rest.\n\n\"There's only ten maintopmen belonging to our watch; if you are one,\nthen there'll be eleven,\" said a second sailor. \"Get out of the top!\"\n\n\"This is too bad, maties,\" cried Israel, \"to serve an old topmate this\nway. Come, come, you are foolish. Give us a quid.\" And, once more, with\nthe utmost sociability, he addressed the sailor next to him.\n\n\"Look ye,\" returned the other, \"if you don't make away with yourself,\nyou skulking spy from the mizzen, we'll drop you to deck like a\njewel-block.\"\n\nSeeing the party thus resolute, Israel, with some affected banter,\ndescended.\n\nThe reason why he had tried the scheme--and, spite of the foregoing\nfailure, meant to repeat it--was this: As customary in armed ships, the\nmen were in companies allotted to particular places and functions.\nTherefore, to escape final detection, Israel must some way get himself\nrecognized as belonging to some one of those bands; otherwise, as an\nisolated nondescript, discovery ere long would be certain, especially\nupon the next general muster. To be sure, the hope in question was a\nforlorn sort of hope, but it was his sole one, and must therefore be\ntried.\n\nMixing in again for a while with the general watch, he at last goes on\nthe forecastle among the sheet-anchor-men there, at present engaged in\ncritically discussing the merits of the late valiant encounter, and\nexpressing their opinion that by daybreak the enemy in chase would be\nhull-down out of sight.\n\n\"To be sure she will,\" cried Israel, joining in with the group, \"old\nballyhoo that she is, to be sure. But didn't we pepper her, lads? Give\nus a chew of tobacco, one of ye. How many have we wounded, do ye know?\nNone killed that I've heard of. Wasn't that a fine hoax we played on\n'em? Ha! ha! But give us a chew.\"\n\nIn the prodigal fraternal patriotism of the moment, one of the old\nworthies freely handed his plug to our adventurer, who, helping himself,\nreturned it, repeating the question as to the killed and wounded.\n\n\"Why,\" said he of the plug, \"Jack Jewboy told me, just now, that there's\nonly seven men been carried down to the surgeon, but not a soul killed.\"\n\n\"Good, boys, good!\" cried Israel, moving up to one of the gun-carriages,\nwhere three or four men were sitting--\"slip along, chaps, slip along,\nand give a watchmate a seat with ye.\"\n\n\"All full here, lad; try the next gun.\"\n\n\"Boys, clear a place here,\", said Israel, advancing, like one of the\nfamily, to that gun.\n\n\"Who the devil are _you_, making this row here?\" demanded a\nstern-looking old fellow, captain of the forecastle, \"seems to me you\nmake considerable noise. Are you a forecastleman?\"\n\n\"If the bowsprit belongs here, so do I,\" rejoined Israel, composedly.\n\n\"Let's look at ye, then!\" and seizing a battle-lantern, before thrust\nunder a gun, the old veteran came close to Israel before he had time to\nelude the scrutiny.\n\n\"Take that!\" said his examiner, and fetching Israel a terrible thump,\npushed him ignominiously off the forecastle as some unknown interloper\nfrom distant parts of the ship.\n\nWith similar perseverance of effrontery, Israel tried other quarters of\nthe vessel. But with equal ill success. Jealous with the spirit of\nclass, no social circle would receive him. As a last resort, he dived\ndown among the _holders_.\n\nA group of them sat round a lantern, in the dark bowels of the ship,\nlike a knot of charcoal burners in a pine forest at midnight.\n\n\"Well, boys, what's the good word?\" said Israel, advancing very\ncordially, but keeping as much as possible in the shadow.\n\n\"The good word is,\" rejoined a censorious old _holder_, \"that you had\nbest go where you belong--on deck--and not be a skulking down here where\nyou _don't_ belong. I suppose this is the way you skulked during the\nfight.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're growly to-night, shipmate,\" said Israel, pleasantly--\"supper\nsits hard on your conscience.\"\n\n\"Get out of the hold with ye,\" roared the other. \"On deck, or I'll call\nthe master-at-arms.\"\n\nOnce more Israel decamped.\n\nSorely against his grain, as a final effort to blend himself openly with\nthe crew, he now went among the _waisters_: the vilest caste of an armed\nship's company, mere dregs and settlings--sea-Pariahs, comprising all\nthe lazy, all the inefficient, all the unfortunate and fated, all the\nmelancholy, all the infirm, all the rheumatical scamps, scapegraces,\nruined prodigal sons, sooty faces, and swineherds of the crew, not\nexcluding those with dismal wardrobes.\n\nAn unhappy, tattered, moping row of them sat along dolefully on the\ngun-deck, like a parcel of crest-fallen buzzards, exiled from civilized\nsociety.\n\n\"Cheer up, lads,\" said Israel, in a jovial tone, \"homeward-bound, you\nknow. Give us a seat among ye, friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, sit on your head!\" answered a sullen fellow in the corner.\n\n\"Come, come, no growling; we're homeward-bound. Whoop, my hearties!\"\n\n\"Workhouse bound, you mean,\" grumbled another sorry chap, in a darned\nshirt.\n\n\"Oh, boys, don't be down-hearted. Let's keep up our spirits. Sing us a\nsong, one of ye, and I'll give the chorus.\"\n\n\"Sing if ye like, but I'll plug my ears, for one,\" said still another\nsulky varlet, with the toes out of his sea-boots, while all the rest\nwith one roar of misanthropy joined him.\n\nBut Israel, riot to be daunted, began:\n\n\"'Cease, rude Boreas, cease your growling!'\"\n\n\"And you cease your squeaking, will ye?\" cried a fellow in a banged\ntarpaulin. \"Did ye get a ball in the windpipe, that ye cough that way,\nworse nor a broken-nosed old bellows? Have done with your groaning, it's\nworse nor the death-rattle.\"\n\n\"Boys, is this the way you treat a watchmate\" demanded Israel\nreproachfully, \"trying to cheer up his friends? Shame on ye, boys. Come,\nlet's be sociable. Spin us a yarn, one of ye. Meantime, rub my back for\nme, another,\" and very confidently he leaned against his neighbor.\n\n\"Lean off me, will ye?\" roared his friend, shoving him away.\n\n\"But who _is_ this ere singing, leaning, yarn-spinning chap? Who are ye?\nBe you a waister, or be you not?\"\n\nSo saying, one of this peevish, sottish band staggered close up to\nIsrael. But there was a deck above and a deck below, and the lantern\nswung in the distance. It was too dim to see with critical exactness.\n\n\"No such singing chap belongs to our gang, that's flat,\" he dogmatically\nexclaimed at last, after an ineffectual scrutiny. \"Sail out of this!\"\n\nAnd with a shove once more, poor Israel was ejected.\n\nBlackballed out of every club, he went disheartened on deck. So long,\nwhile light screened him at least, as he contented himself with\npromiscuously circulating, all was safe; it was the endeavor to\nfraternize with any one set which was sure to endanger him. At last,\nwearied out, he happened to find himself on the berth deck, where the\nwatch below were slumbering. Some hundred and fifty hammocks were on\nthat deck. Seeing one empty, he leaped in, thinking luck might yet some\nway befriend him. Here, at last, the sultry confinement put him fast\nasleep. He was wakened by a savage whiskerando of the other watch, who,\nseizing him by his waistband, dragged him most indecorously out,\nfuriously denouncing him for a skulker.\n\nSpringing to his feet, Israel perceived from the crowd and tumult of the\nberth deck, now all alive with men leaping into their hammocks, instead\nof being full of sleepers quietly dosing therein, that the watches were\nchanged. Going above, he renewed in various quarters his offers of\nintimacy with the fresh men there assembled; but was successively\nrepulsed as before. At length, just as day was breaking, an irascible\nfellow whose stubborn opposition our adventurer had long in vain sought\nto conciliate--this man suddenly perceiving, by the gray morning light,\nthat Israel had somehow an alien sort of general look, very savagely\npressed him for explicit information as to who he might be. The answers\nincreased his suspicion. Others began to surround the two. Presently,\nquite a circle was formed. Sailors from distant parts of the ship drew\nnear. One, and then another, and another, declared that they, in their\nquarters, too, had been molested by a vagabond claiming fraternity, and\nseeking to palm himself off upon decent society. In vain Israel\nprotested. The truth, like the day, dawned clearer and clearer. More and\nmore closely he was scanned. At length the hour for having all hands on\ndeck arrived; when the other watch which Israel had first tried,\nreascending to the deck, and hearing the matter in discussion, they\nendorsed the charge of molestation and attempted imposture through the\nnight, on the part of some person unknown, but who, likely enough, was\nthe strange man now before them. In the end, the master-at-arms appeared\nwith his bamboo, who, summarily collaring poor Israel, led him as a\nmysterious culprit to the officer of the deck, which gentleman having\nheard the charge, examined him in great perplexity, and, saying that he\ndid not at all recognize that countenance, requested the junior officers\nto contribute their scrutiny. But those officers were equally at fault.\n\n\"Who the deuce _are_ you?\" at last said the officer-of-the-deck, in\nadded bewilderment. \"Where did you come from? What's your business?\nWhere are you stationed? What's your name? Who are you, any way? How did\nyou get here? and where are you going?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Israel very humbly, \"I am going to my regular duty, if\nyou will but let me. I belong to the maintop, and ought to be now\nengaged in preparing the topgallant stu'n'-sail for hoisting.\"\n\n\"Belong to the maintop? Why, these men here say you have been trying to\nbelong to the foretop, and the mizzentop, and the forecastle, and the\nhold, and the waist, and every other part of the ship. This is\nextraordinary,\" he added, turning upon the junior officers.\n\n\"He must be out of his mind,\" replied one of them, the sailing-master.\n\n\"Out of his mind?\" rejoined the officer-of-the-deck. \"He's out of all\nreason; out of all men's knowledge and memories! Why, no one knows him;\nno one has ever seen him before; no imagination, in the wildest flight\nof a morbid nightmare, has ever so much as dreamed of him. Who _are_\nyou?\" he again added, fierce with amazement. \"What's your name? Are you\ndown in the ship's books, or at all in the records of nature?\"\n\n\"My name, sir, is Peter Perkins,\" said Israel, thinking it most prudent\nto conceal his real appellation.\n\n\"Certainly, I never heard that name before. Pray, see if Peter Perkins\nis down on the quarter-bills,\" he added to a midshipman. \"Quick, bring\nthe book here.\"\n\nHaving received it, he ran his fingers along the columns, and dashing\ndown the book, declared that no such name was there.\n\n\"You are not down, sir. There is no Peter Perkins here. Tell me at once\nwho are you?\"\n\n\"It might be, sir,\" said Israel, gravely, \"that seeing I shipped under\nthe effects of liquor, I might, out of absent-mindedness like, have\ngiven in some other person's name instead of my own.\"\n\n\"Well, what name have you gone by among your shipmates since you've\nbeen aboard?\"\n\n\"Peter Perkins, sir.\"\n\nUpon this the officer turned to the men around, inquiring whether the\nname of Peter Perkins was familiar to them as that of a shipmate. One\nand all answered no.\n\n\"This won't do, sir,\" now said the officer. \"You see it won't do. Who\nare you?\"\n\n\"A poor persecuted fellow at your service, sir.\"\n\n\"_Who_ persecutes you?\"\n\n\"Every one, sir. All hands seem to be against me; none of them willing\nto remember me.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" demanded the officer earnestly, \"how long do you remember\nyourself? Do you remember yesterday morning? You must have come into\nexistence by some sort of spontaneous combustion in the hold. Or were\nyou fired aboard from the enemy, last night, in a cartridge? Do you\nremember yesterday?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What was you doing yesterday?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, for one thing, I believe I had the honor of a little talk\nwith yourself.\"\n\n\"With _me_?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; about nine o'clock in the morning--the sea being smooth and\nthe ship running, as I should think, about seven knots--you came up into\nthe maintop, where I belong, and was pleased to ask my opinion about the\nbest way to set a topgallant stu'n'-sail.\"\n\n\"He's mad! He's mad!\" said the officer, with delirious conclusiveness.\n\"Take him away, take him away, take him away--put him somewhere,\nmaster-at-arms. Stay, one test more. What mess do you belong to?\"\n\n\"Number 12, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tidds,\" to a midshipman, \"send mess No. 12 to the mast.\"\n\nTen sailors replied to the summons, and arranged themselves before\nIsrael.\n\n\"Men, does this man belong to your mess?\"\n\n\"No, sir; never saw him before this morning.\"\n\n\"What are those men's names?\" he demanded of Israel.\n\n\"Well, sir, I am so intimate with all of them,\" looking upon them with\na kindly glance, \"I never call them by their real names, but by\nnicknames. So, never using their real names, I have forgotten them. The\nnicknames that I know, them by, are Towser, Bowser, Rowser, Snowser.\"\n\n\"Enough. Mad as a March hare. Take him away. Hold,\" again added the\nofficer, whom some strange fascination still bound to the bootless\ninvestigation. \"What's _my_ name, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, one of my messmates here called you Lieutenant Williamson,\njust now, and I never heard you called by any other name.\"\n\n\"There's method in his madness,\" thought the officer to himself. \"What's\nthe captain's name?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, when we spoke the enemy, last night, I heard him say, through\nhis trumpet, that he was Captain Parker; and very likely he knows his\nown name.\"\n\n\"I have you now. That ain't the captain's real name.\"\n\n\"He's the best judge himself, sir, of what his name is, I should think.\"\n\n\"Were it not,\" said the officer, now turning gravely upon his juniors,\n\"were it not that such a supposition were on other grounds absurd, I\nshould certainly conclude that this man, in some unknown way, got on\nboard here from the enemy last night.\"\n\n\"How could he, sir?\" asked the sailing-master.\n\n\"Heaven knows. But our spanker-boom geared the other ship, you know, in\nmanoeuvring to get headway.\"\n\n\"But supposing he _could_ have got here that fashion, which is quite\nimpossible under all the circumstances, what motive could have induced\nhim voluntarily to jump among enemies?\"\n\n\"Let him answer for himself,\" said the officer, turning suddenly upon\nIsrael, with the view of taking him off his guard, by the matter of\ncourse assumption of the very point at issue.\n\n\"Answer, sir. Why did you jump on board here, last night, from the\nenemy?\"\n\n\"Jump on board, sir, from the enemy? Why, sir, my station at general\nquarters is at gun No. 3, of the lower deck, here.\"\n\n\"He's cracked--or else I am turned--or all the world is;--take him\naway!\"\n\n\"But where am I to take him, sir?\" said the master-at-arms. \"He don't\nseem to belong anywhere, sir. Where--where am I to take him?\"\n\n\"Take him-out of sight,\" said the officer, now incensed with his own\nperplexity. \"Take him out of sight, I say.\"\n\n\"Come along, then, my ghost,\" said the master-at-arms. And, collaring\nthe phantom, he led it hither and thither, not knowing exactly what to\ndo with it.\n\nSome fifteen minutes passed, when the captain coming from his cabin, and\nobserving the master-at-arms leading Israel about in this indefinite\nstyle, demanded the reason of that procedure, adding that it was against\nhis express orders for any new and degrading punishments to be invented\nfor his men.\n\n\"Come here, master-at-arms. To what end do you lead that man about?\"\n\n\"To no end in the world, sir. I keep leading him about because he has\nno final destination.\"\n\n\"Mr. Officer-of-the-deck, what does this mean? Who is this strange man?\nI don't know that I remember him. Who is he? And what is signified by\nhis being led about?\"\n\nHereupon the officer-of-the-deck, throwing himself into a tragical\nposture, set forth the entire mystery; much to the captain's\nastonishment, who at once indignantly turned upon the phantom.\n\n\"You rascal--don't try to deceive me. Who are you? and where did you\ncome from last?\"\n\n\"Sir, my name is Peter Perkins, and I last came from the forecastle,\nwhere the master-at-arms last led me, before coming here.\"\n\n\"No joking, sir, no joking.\"\n\n\"Sir, I'm sure it's too serious a business to joke about.\"\n\n\"Do you have the assurance to say, that you, as a regularly shipped man,\nhave been on board this vessel ever since she sailed from Falmouth, ten\nmonths ago?\"\n\n\"Sir, anxious to secure a berth under so good a commander, I was among\nthe first to enlist.\"\n\n\"What ports have we touched at, sir?\" said the captain, now in a little\nsofter tone.\n\n\"Ports, sir, ports?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, _ports_\"\n\nIsrael began to scratch his yellow hair.\n\n\"What _ports_, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, sir:--Boston, for one.\"\n\n\"Right there,\" whispered a midshipman.\n\n\"What was the next port, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I was saying Boston was the _first_ port, I believe; wasn't\nit?--and\"--\n\n\"The _second_ port, sir, is what I want.\"\n\n\"Well--New York.\"\n\n\"Right again,\" whispered the midshipman.\n\n\"And what port are we bound to, now?\"\n\n\"Let me see--homeward-bound--Falmouth, sir.\"\n\n\"What sort of a place is Boston?\"\n\n\"Pretty considerable of a place, sir.\"\n\n\"Very straight streets, ain't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; cow-paths, cut by sheep-walks, and intersected with\nhen-tracks.\"\n\n\"When did we fire the first gun?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, just as we were leaving Falmouth, ten months\nago--signal-gun, sir.\"\n\n\"Where did we fire the first _shotted_ gun, sir?--and what was the name\nof the privateer we took upon that occasion?\"\n\n\"'Pears to me, sir, at that time I was on the sick list. Yes, sir, that\nmust have been the time; I had the brain fever, and lost my mind for a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"Master-at-arms, take this man away.\"\n\n\"Where shall I take him, sir?\" touching his cap.\n\n\"Go, and air him on the forecastle.\"\n\nSo they resumed their devious wanderings. At last, they descended to the\nberth-deck. It being now breakfast-time, the master-at-arms, a\ngood-humored man, very kindly' introduced our hero to his mess, and\npresented him with breakfast, during which he in vain endeavored, by\nall sorts of subtle blandishments, to worm out his secret.\n\nAt length Israel was set at liberty; and whenever there was any\nimportant duty to be done, volunteered to it with such cheerful\nalacrity, and approved himself so docile and excellent a seaman, that he\nconciliated the approbation of all the officers, as well as the captain;\nwhile his general sociability served, in the end, to turn in his favor\nthe suspicious hearts of the mariners. Perceiving his good qualities,\nboth as a sailor and man, the captain of the maintop applied for his\nadmission into that section of the ship; where, still improving upon his\nformer reputation, our hero did duty for the residue of the voyage.\n\nOne pleasant afternoon, the last of the passage, when the ship was\nnearing the Lizard, within a few hours' sail of her port, the\nofficer-of-the-deck, happening to glance upwards towards the maintop,\ndescried Israel there, leaning very leisurely over the rail, looking\nmildly down where the officer stood.\n\n\"Well, Peter Perkins, you seem to belong to the maintop, after all.\"\n\n\"I always told you so, sir,\" smiled Israel benevolently down upon him,\n\"though, at first, you remember, sir, you would not believe it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nSAMSON AMONG THE PHILISTINES.\n\n\nAt length, as the ship, gliding on past three or four vessels at anchor\nin the roadstead--one, a man-of-war just furling her sails--came nigh\nFalmouth town, Israel, from his perch, saw crowds in violent commotion\non the shore, while the adjacent roofs were covered with sightseers. A\nlarge man-of-war cutter was just landing its occupants, among whom were\na corporal's guard and three officers, besides the naval lieutenant and\nboat's crew. Some of this company having landed, and formed a sort of\nlane among the mob, two trim soldiers, armed to the teeth, rose in the\nstern-sheets; and between them, a martial man of Patagonian stature,\ntheir ragged and handcuffed captive, whose defiant head overshadowed\ntheirs, as St. Paul's dome its inferior steeples. Immediately the mob\nraised a shout, pressing in curiosity towards the colossal stranger; so\nthat, drawing their swords, four of the soldiers had to force a passage\nfor their comrades, who followed on, conducting the giant.\n\nAs the letter of marque drew still nigher, Israel heard the officer in\ncommand of the party ashore shouting, \"To the castle! to the castle!\"\nand so, surrounded by shouting throngs, the company moved on, preceded\nby the three drawn swords, ever and anon flourished at the rioters,\ntowards a large grim pile on a cliff about a mile from the landing. Long\nas they were in sight, the bulky form of the captive was seen at times\nswayingly towering over the flashing bayonets and cutlasses, like a\ngreat whale breaching amid a hostile retinue of sword-fish. Now and\nthen, too, with barbaric scorn, he taunted them with cramped gestures of\nhis manacled hands.\n\nWhen at last the vessel had gained her anchorage, opposite a distant\ndetached warehouse, all was still; and the work of breaking out in the\nhold immediately commencing, and continuing till nightfall, absorbed all\nfurther attention for the present.\n\nNext day was Sunday; and about noon Israel, with others, was allowed to\ngo ashore for a stroll. The town was quiet. Seeing nothing very\ninteresting there, he passed out, alone, into the fields alongshore, and\npresently found himself climbing the cliff whereon stood the grim pile\nbefore spoken of.\n\n\"What place is yon?\" he asked of a rustic passing.\n\n\"Pendennis Castle.\"\n\nAs he stepped upon the short crisp sward under its walls, he started at\na violent sound from within, as of the roar of some tormented lion. Soon\nthe sound became articulate, and he heard the following words bayed out\nwith an amazing vigor:\n\n\"Brag no more, Old England; consider you are but an island! Order back\nyour broken battalions! home, and repent in ashes! Long enough have your\nhired tories across the sea forgotten the Lord their God, and bowed down\nto Howe and Kniphausen--the Hessian!--Hands off, red-skinned jackal!\nWearing the king's plate,[A] as I do, I have treasures of wrath against\nyou British.\"\n\n[Footnote A: Meaning, probably, certain manacles.]\n\nThen came a clanking, as of a chain; many vengeful sounds, all\nconfusedly together; with strugglings. Then again the voice:\n\n\"Ye brought me out here, from my dungeon to this green--affronting yon\nSabbath sun--to see how a rebel looks. But I show ye how a true\ngentleman and Christian can conduct in adversity. Back, dogs! Respect a\ngentleman and a Christian, though he _be_ in rags and smell of\nbilge-water.\"\n\nFilled with astonishment at these words, which came from over a massive\nwall, enclosing what seemed an open parade-space, Israel pressed\nforward, and soon came to a black archway, leading far within,\nunderneath, to a grassy tract, through a tower. Like two boar's tusks,\ntwo sentries stood on guard at either side of the open jaws of the arch.\nScrutinizing our adventurer a moment, they signed him permission to\nenter.\n\nArrived at the end of the arched-way, where the sun shone, Israel stood\ntransfixed, at the scene.\n\nLike some baited bull in the ring, crouched the Patagonian-looking\ncaptive, handcuffed as before; the grass of the green trampled, and\ngored up all about him, both by his own movements and those of the\npeople around. Except some soldiers and sailors, these seemed mostly\ntownspeople, collected here out of curiosity. The stranger was\noutlandishly arrayed in the sorry remains of a half-Indian,\nhalf-Canadian sort of a dress, consisting of a fawn-skin jacket--the fur\noutside and hanging in ragged tufts--a half-rotten, bark-like belt of\nwampum; aged breeches of sagathy; bedarned worsted stockings to the\nknee; old moccasins riddled with holes, their metal tags yellow with\nsalt-water rust; a faded red woollen bonnet, not unlike a Russian\nnight-cap, or a portentous, ensanguined full-moon, all soiled, and stuck\nabout with bits of half-rotted straw. He seemed just broken from the\ndead leases in David's outlawed Cave of Adullam. Unshaven, beard and\nhair matted, and profuse as a corn-field beaten down by hailstorms, his\nwhole marred aspect was that of some wild beast; but of a royal sort,\nand unsubdued by the cage.\n\n\"Aye, stare, stare! Though but last night dragged out of a ship's hold,\nlike a smutty tierce; and this morning out of your littered barracks\nhere, like a murderer; for all that, you may well stare at Ethan\nTiconderoga Allen, the unconquered soldier, by ----! You Turks never saw\na Christian before. Stare on! I am he, who, when your Lord Howe wanted\nto bribe a patriot to fall down and worship him by an offer of a\nmajor-generalship and five thousand acres of choice land in old\nVermont--(Ha! three-times-three for glorious old Vermont, and my\nGreen-Mountain boys! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!) I am he, I say, who\nanswered your Lord Howe, 'You, _you_ offer _our_ land? You are like the\ndevil in Scripture, offering all the kingdoms in the world, when the\nd----d soul had not a corner-lot on earth! Stare on!'\"\n\n\"Look you, rebel, you had best heed how you talk against General Lord\nHowe,\" here said a thin, wasp-waisted, epauletted officer of the castle,\ncoming near and flourishing his sword like a schoolmaster's ferule.\n\n\"General Lord Howe? Heed how I talk of that toad-hearted king's\nlick-spittle of a scarlet poltroon; the vilest wriggler in God's\nworm-hole below? I tell you, that herds of red-haired devils are\nimpatiently snorting to ladle Lord Howe with all his gang (you included)\ninto the seethingest syrups of tophet's flames!\"\n\nAt this blast, the wasp-waisted officer was blown backwards as from\nbefore the suddenly burst head of a steam-boiler.\n\nStaggering away, with a snapped spine, he muttered something about its\nbeing beneath his dignity to bandy further words with a low-lived rebel.\n\n\"Come, come, Colonel Allen,\" here said a mild-looking man in a sort of\nclerical undress, \"respect the day better than to talk thus of what lies\nbeyond. Were you to die this hour, or what is more probable, be hung\nnext week at Tower-wharf, you know not what might become, in eternity,\nof yourself.\"\n\n\"Reverend Sir,\" with a mocking bow, \"when not better employed braiding\nmy beard, I have a little dabbled in your theologies. And let me tell\nyou, Reverend Sir,\" lowering and intensifying his voice, \"that as to the\nworld of spirits, of which you hint, though I know nothing of the mode\nor manner of that world, no more than do you, yet I expect when I shall\narrive there to be treated as well as any other gentleman of my merit.\nThat is to say, far better than you British know how to treat an\nAmerican officer and meek-hearted Christian captured in honorable war,\nby ----! Every one tells me, as you yourself just breathed, and as,\ncrossing the sea, every billow dinned into my ear, that I, Ethan Allen,\nam to be hung like a thief. If I am, the great Jehovah and the\nContinental Congress shall avenge me; while I, for my part, shall show\nyou, even on the tree, how a Christian gentleman can die. Meantime, sir,\nif you are the clergyman you look, act out your consolatory function, by\ngetting an unfortunate Christian gentleman about to die, a bowl of\npunch.\"\n\nThe good-natured stranger, not to have his religious courtesy appealed\nto in vain, immediately dispatched his servant, who stood by, to procure\nthe beverage.\n\nAt this juncture, a faint rustling sound, as of the advance of an army\nwith banners, was heard. Silks, scarfs, and ribbons fluttered in the\nbackground. Presently, a bright squadron of fair ladies drew nigh,\nescorted by certain outriding gallants of Falmouth.\n\n\"Ah,\" sighed a soft voice, \"what a strange sash, and furred vest, and\nwhat leopard-like teeth, and what flaxen hair, but all mildewed;--is\nthat he?\"\n\n\"Yea, is it, lovely charmer,\" said Allen, like an Ottoman, bowing over\nhis broad, bovine forehead, and breathing the words out like a lute; \"it\nis he--Ethan Allen, the soldier; now, since ladies' eyes visit him, made\ntrebly a captive.\"\n\n\"Why, he talks like a beau in a parlor, this wild, mossed American from\nthe woods,\" sighed another fair lady to her mate; \"but can this be he we\ncame to see? I must have a lock of his hair.\"\n\n\"It is he, adorable Delilah; and fear not, even though incited by the\nfoe, by clipping my locks, to dwindle my strength. Give me your sword,\nman,\" turning to an officer:--\"Ah! I'm fettered. Clip it yourself,\nlady.\"\n\n\"No, no--I am--\"\n\n\"Afraid, would you say? Afraid of the vowed friend and champion of all\nladies all round the world? Nay, nay, come hither.\"\n\nThe lady advanced; and soon, overcoming her timidity, her white hand\nshone like whipped foam amid the matted waves of flaxen hair.\n\n\"Ah, this is like clipping tangled tags of gold-lace,\" cried she; \"but\nsee, it is half straw.\"\n\n\"But the wearer is no man-of-straw, lady; were I free, and you had ten\nthousand foes--horse, foot, and dragoons--how like a friend I could\nfight for you! Come, you have robbed me of my hair; let me rob your\ndainty hand of its price. What, afraid again?\"\n\n\"No, not that; but--\"\n\n\"I see, lady; I may do it, by your leave, but not by your word; the\nwonted way of ladies. There, it is done. Sweeter that kiss, than the\nbitter heart of a cherry.\"\n\nWhen at length this lady left, no small talk was had by her with her\ncompanions about someway relieving the hard lot of so knightly an\nunfortunate. Whereupon a worthy, judicious gentleman, of middle-age, in\nattendance, suggested a bottle of good wine every day, and clean linen\nonce every week. And these the gentle Englishwoman--too polite and too\ngood to be fastidious--did indeed actually send to Ethan Allen, so long\nas he tarried a captive in her land.\n\nThe withdrawal of this company was followed by a different scene.\n\nA perspiring man in top-boots, a riding-whip in his hand, and having the\nair of a prosperous farmer, brushed in, like a stray bullock, among the\nrest, for a peep at the giant; having just entered through the arch, as\nthe ladies passed out.\n\n\"Hearing that the man who took Ticonderoga was here in Pendennis Castle,\nI've ridden twenty-five miles to see him; and to-morrow my brother will\nride forty for the same purpose. So let me have first look. Sir,\" he\ncontinued, addressing the captive, \"will you let me ask you a few plain\nquestions, and be free with you?\"\n\n\"Be free with me? With all my heart. I love freedom of all things. I'm\nready to die for freedom; I expect to. So be free as you please. What is\nit?\"\n\n\"Then, sir, permit me to ask what is your occupation in life--in time of\npeace, I mean?\"\n\n\"You talk like a tax-gatherer,\" rejoined Allen, squinting diabolically\nat him; \"what is my occupation in life? Why, in my younger days I\nstudied divinity, but at present I am a conjurer by profession.\"\n\nHereupon everybody laughed, equally at the manner as the words, and the\nnettled farmer retorted:\n\n\"Conjurer, eh? well, you conjured wrong that time you were taken.\"\n\n\"Not so wrong, though, as you British did, that time I took Ticonderoga,\nmy friend.\"\n\nAt this juncture the servant came with the punch, when his master bade\nhim present it to the captive.\n\n\"No!--give it me, sir, with your own hands, and pledge me as gentleman\nto gentleman.\"\n\n\"I cannot pledge a state-prisoner, Colonel Allen; but I will hand you\nthe punch with my own hands, since you insist upon it.\"\n\n\"Spoken and done like a true gentleman, sir; I am bound to you.\"\n\nThen receiving the bowl into his gyved hands, the iron ringing against\nthe china, he put it to his lips, and saying, \"I hereby give the British\nnation credit for half a minute's good usage,\" at one draught emptied it\nto the bottom.\n\n\"The rebel gulps it down like a swilling hog at a trough,\" here scoffed\na lusty private of the guard, off duty.\n\n\"Shame to you!\" cried the giver of the bowl.\n\n\"Nay, sir; his red coat is a standing blush to him, as it is to the\nwhole scarlet-blushing British army.\" Then turning derisively upon the\nprivate: \"You object to my way of taking things, do ye? I fear I shall\nnever please ye. You objected to the way, too, in which I took\nTiconderoga, and the way in which I meant to take Montreal. Selah! But\npray, now that I look at you, are not you the hero I caught dodging\nround, in his shirt, in the cattle-pen, inside the fort? It was the\nbreak of day, you remember.\"\n\n\"Come, Yankee,\" here swore the incensed private; \"cease this, or I'll\ndarn your old fawn-skins for ye with the flat of this sword;\" for a\nspecimen, laying it lashwise, but not heavily, across the captive's\nback.\n\nTurning like a tiger, the giant, catching the steel between his teeth,\nwrenched it from the private's grasp, and striking it with his manacles,\nsent it spinning like a juggler's dagger into the air, saying, \"Lay your\ndirty coward's iron on a tied gentleman again, and these,\" lifting his\nhandcuffed fists, \"shall be the beetle of mortality to you!\"\n\nThe now furious soldier would have struck him with all his force, but\nseveral men of the town interposed, reminding him that it were\noutrageous to attack a chained captive.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Allen, \"I am accustomed to that, and therefore I am\nbeforehand with them; and the extremity of what I say against Britain,\nis not meant for you, kind friends, but for my insulters, present and to\ncome.\" Then recognizing among the interposers the giver of the bowl, he\nturned with a courteous bow, saying, \"Thank you again and again, my good\nsir; you may not be the worse for this; ours is an unstable world; so\nthat one gentleman never knows when it may be his turn to be helped of\nanother.\"\n\nBut the soldier still making a riot, and the commotion growing general,\na superior officer stepped up, who terminated the scene by remanding the\nprisoner to his cell, dismissing the townspeople, with all strangers,\nIsrael among the rest, and closing the castle gates after them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nSOMETHING FURTHER OF ETHAN ALLEN; WITH ISRAEL'S FLIGHT TOWARDS THE\nWILDERNESS.\n\n\nAmong the episodes of the Revolutionary War, none is stranger than that\nof Ethan Allen in England; the event and the man being equally uncommon.\n\nAllen seems to have been a curious combination of a Hercules, a Joe\nMiller, a Bayard, and a Tom Hyer; had a person like the Belgian giants;\nmountain music in him like a Swiss; a heart plump as Coeur de Lion's.\nThough born in New England, he exhibited no trace of her character. He\nwas frank, bluff, companionable as a Pagan, convivial, a Roman, hearty\nas a harvest. His spirit was essentially Western; and herein is his\npeculiar Americanism; for the Western spirit is, or will yet be (for no\nother is, or can be), the true American one.\n\nFor the most part, Allen's manner while in England was scornful and\nferocious in the last degree; however, qualified by that wild, heroic\nsort of levity, which in the hour of oppression or peril seems\ninseparable from a nature like his; the mode whereby such a temper best\nevinces its barbaric disdain of adversity, and how cheaply and\nwaggishly it holds the malice, even though triumphant, of its foes!\nAside from that inevitable egotism relatively pertaining to pine trees,\nspires, and giants, there were, perhaps, two special incidental reasons\nfor the Titanic Vermonter's singular demeanor abroad. Taken captive\nwhile heading a forlorn hope before Montreal, he was treated with\ninexcusable cruelty and indignity; something as if he had fallen into\nthe hands of the Dyaks. Immediately upon his capture he would have been\ndeliberately suffered to have been butchered by the Indian allies in\ncold blood on the spot, had he not, with desperate intrepidity, availed\nhimself of his enormous physical strength, by twitching a British\nofficer to him, and using him for a living target, whirling him round\nand round against the murderous tomahawks of the savages. Shortly\nafterwards, led into the town, fenced about by bayonets of the guard,\nthe commander of the enemy, one Colonel McCloud, flourished his cane\nover the captive's head, with brutal insults promising him a rebel's\nhalter at Tyburn. During his passage to England in the same ship wherein\nwent passenger Colonel Guy Johnson, the implacable tory, he was kept\nheavily ironed in the hold, and in all ways treated as a common\nmutineer; or, it may be, rather as a lion of Asia; which, though caged,\nwas still too dreadful to behold without fear and trembling, and\nconsequent cruelty. And no wonder, at least for the fear; for on one\noccasion, when chained hand and foot, he was insulted on shipboard by an\nofficer; with his teeth he twisted off the nail that went through the\nmortise of his handcuffs, and so, having his arms at liberty, challenged\nhis insulter to combat. Often, as at Pendennis Castle, when no other\navengement was at hand, he would hurl on his foes such howling tempests\nof anathema as fairly to shock them into retreat. Prompted by somewhat\nsimilar motives, both on shipboard and in England, he would often make\nthe most vociferous allusions to Ticonderoga, and the part he played in\nits capture, well knowing, that of all American names, Ticonderoga was,\nat that period, by far the most famous and galling to Englishmen.\n\nParlor-men, dancing-masters, the graduates of the Albe Bellgarde, may\nshrug their laced shoulders at the boisterousness of Allen in England.\nTrue, he stood upon no punctilios with his jailers; for where modest\ngentlemanhood is all on one side, it is a losing affair; as if my Lord\nChesterfield should take off his hat, and smile, and bow, to a mad bull,\nin hopes of a reciprocation of politeness. When among wild beasts, if\nthey menace you, be a wild beast. Neither is it unlikely that this was\nthe view taken by Allen. For, besides the exasperating tendency to\nself-assertion which such treatment as his must have bred on a man like\nhim, his experience must have taught him, that by assuming the part of a\njocular, reckless, and even braggart barbarian, he would better sustain\nhimself against bullying turnkeys than by submissive quietude. Nor\nshould it be forgotten, that besides the petty details of personal\nmalice, the enemy violated every international usage of right and\ndecency, in treating a distinguished prisoner of war as if he had been a\nBotany-Bay convict. If, at the present day, in any similar case between\nthe same States, the repetition of such outrages would be more than\nunlikely, it is only because it is among nations as among individuals:\nimputed indigence provokes oppression and scorn; but that same indigence\nbeing risen to opulence, receives a politic consideration even from its\nformer insulters.\n\nAs the event proved, in the course Allen pursued, he was right. Because,\nthough at first nothing was talked of by his captors, and nothing\nanticipated by himself, but his ignominious execution, or at the least,\nprolonged and squalid incarceration, nevertheless, these threats and\nprospects evaporated, and by his facetious scorn for scorn, under the\nextremest sufferings, he finally wrung repentant usage from his foes;\nand in the end, being liberated from his irons, and walking the\nquarter-deck where before he had been thrust into the hold, was carried\nback to America, and in due time, at New York, honorably included in a\nregular exchange of prisoners.\n\nIt was not without strange interest that Israel had been an eye-witness\nof the scenes on the Castle Green. Neither was this interest abated by\nthe painful necessity of concealing, for the present, from his brave\ncountryman and fellow-mountaineer, the fact of a friend being nigh. When\nat last the throng was dismissed, walking towards the town with the\nrest, he heard that there were some forty or more Americans, privates,\nconfined on the cliff. Upon this, inventing a pretence, he turned back,\nloitering around the walls for any chance glimpse of the captives.\nPresently, while looking up at a grated embrasure in the tower, he\nstarted at a voice from it familiarly hailing him:\n\n\"Potter, is that you? In God's name how came you here?\"\n\nAt these words, a sentry below had his eye on our astonished\nadventurer. Bringing his piece to bear, he bade him stand. Next moment\nIsrael was under arrest. Being brought into the presence of the forty\nprisoners, where they lay in litters of mouldy straw, strewn with gnawed\nbones, as in a kennel, he recognized among them one Singles, now\nSergeant Singles, the man who, upon our hero's return home from his last\nCape Horn voyage, he had found wedded to his mountain Jenny. Instantly a\nrush of emotions filled him. Not as when Damon found Pythias. But far\nstranger, because very different. For not only had this Singles been an\nalien to Israel (so far as actual intercourse went), but impelled to it\nby instinct, Israel had all but detested him, as a successful, and\nperhaps insidious rival. Nor was it altogether unlikely that Singles had\nreciprocated the feeling. But now, as if the Atlantic rolled, not\nbetween two continents, but two worlds--this, and the next--these alien\nsouls, oblivious to hate, melted down into one.\n\nAt such a juncture, it was hard to maintain a disguise, especially when\nit involved the seeming rejection of advances like the Sergeant's.\nStill, converting his real amazement into affected surprise, Israel, in\npresence of the sentries, declared to Singles that he (Singles) must\nlabor under some unaccountable delusion; for he (Potter) was no Yankee\nrebel, thank Heaven, but a true man to his king; in short, an honest\nEnglishman, born in Kent, and now serving his country, and doing what\ndamage he might to her foes, by being first captain of a carronade on\nboard a letter of marque, that moment in the harbor.\n\nFor a moment the captive stood astounded, but observing Israel more\nnarrowly, detecting his latent look, and bethinking him of the useless\nperil he had thoughtlessly caused to a countryman, no doubt unfortunate\nas himself, Singles took his cue, and pretending sullenly to apologize\nfor his error, put on a disappointed and crest-fallen air. Nevertheless,\nit was not without much difficulty, and after many supplemental\nscrutinies and inquisitions from a board of officers before whom he was\nsubsequently brought, that our wanderer was finally permitted to quit\nthe cliff.\n\nThis luckless adventure not only nipped in the bud a little scheme he\nhad been revolving, for materially befriending Ethan Allen and his\ncomrades, but resulted in making his further stay at Falmouth perilous\nin the extreme. And as if this were not enough, next day, while hanging\nover the side, painting the hull, in trepidation of a visit from the\ncastle soldiers, rumor came to the ship that the man-of-war in the haven\npurposed impressing one-third of the letter of marque's crew; though,\nindeed, the latter vessel was preparing for a second cruise. Being on\nboard a private armed ship, Israel had little dreamed of its liability\nto the same governmental hardships with the meanest merchantman. But the\nsystem of impressment is no respecter either of pity or person.\n\nHis mind was soon determined. Unlike his shipmates, braving immediate\nand lonely hazard, rather than wait for a collective and ultimate one,\nhe cunningly dropped himself overboard the same night, and after the\nnarrowest risk from the muskets of the man-of-war's sentries (whose\ngangways he had to pass), succeeded in swimming to shore, where he fell\nexhausted, but recovering, fled inland, doubly hunted by the thought,\nthat whether as an Englishman, or whether as an American, he would, if\ncaught, be now equally subject to enslavement.\n\nShortly after the break of day, having gained many miles, he succeeded\nin ridding himself of his seaman's clothing, having found some mouldy\nold rags on the banks of a stagnant pond, nigh a rickety building, which\nlooked like a poorhouse--clothing not improbably, as he surmised, left\nthere on the bank by some pauper suicide. Marvel not that he should with\navidity seize these rags; what the suicides abandon, the living hug.\n\nOnce more in beggar's garb, the fugitive sped towards London, prompted\nby the same instinct which impels the hunted fox to the wilderness; for\nsolitudes befriend the endangered wild beast, but crowds are the\nsecurity, because the true desert, of persecuted man. Among the things\nof the capital, Israel for more than forty years was yet to disappear,\nas one entering at dusk into a thick wood. Nor did ever the German\nforest, nor Tasso's enchanted one, contain in its depths more things of\nhorror than eventually were revealed in the secret clefts, gulfs, caves\nand dens of London.\n\nBut here we anticipate a page.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nISRAEL IN EGYPT.\n\n\nIt was a gray, lowering afternoon that, worn out, half starved, and\nhaggard, Israel arrived within some ten or fifteen miles of London, and\nsaw scores and scores of forlorn men engaged in a great brickyard.\n\nFor the most part, brickmaking is all mud and mire. Where, abroad, the\nbusiness is carried on largely, as to supply the London market, hordes\nof the poorest wretches are employed, their grimy tatters naturally\nadapting them to an employ where cleanliness is as much out of the\nquestion as with a drowned man at the bottom of the lake in the Dismal\nSwamp.\n\nDesperate with want, Israel resolved to turn brickmaker, nor did he fear\nto present himself as a stranger, nothing doubting that to such a\nvocation his rags would be accounted the best letters of introduction.\n\nTo be brief, he accosted one of the many surly overseers, or taskmasters\nof the yard, who, with no few pompous airs, finally engaged him at six\nshillings a week, almost equivalent to a dollar and a half. He was\nappointed to one of the mills for grinding up the ingredients. This\nmill stood in the open air. It was of a rude, primitive, Eastern aspect,\nconsisting of a sort of hopper, emptying into a barrel-shaped\nreceptacle. In the barrel was a clumsy machine turned round at its axis\nby a great bent beam, like a well-sweep, only it was horizontal; to this\nbeam, at its outer end, a spavined old horse was attached. The muddy\nmixture was shovelled into the hopper by spavined-looking old men,\nwhile, trudging wearily round and round, the spavined old horse ground\nit all up till it slowly squashed out at the bottom of the barrel, in a\ndoughy compound, all ready for the moulds. Where the dough squeezed out\nof the barrel a pit was sunken, so as to bring the moulder here\nstationed down to a level with the trough, into which the dough fell.\nIsrael was assigned to this pit. Men came to him continually, reaching\ndown rude wooden trays, divided into compartments, each of the size and\nshape of a brick. With a flat sort of big ladle, Israel slapped the\ndough into the trays from the trough; then, with a bit of smooth board,\nscraped the top even, and handed it up. Half buried there in the pit,\nall the time handing those desolate trays, poor Israel seemed some\ngravedigger, or churchyard man, tucking away dead little innocents in\ntheir coffins on one side, and cunningly disinterring them again to\nresurrectionists stationed on the other.\n\nTwenty of these melancholy old mills were in operation. Twenty\nheartbroken old horses, rigged out deplorably in cast-off old cart\nharness, incessantly tugged at twenty great shaggy beams; while from\ntwenty half-burst old barrels, twenty wads of mud, with a lava-like\ncourse, gouged out into twenty old troughs, to be slapped by twenty\ntattered men into the twenty-times-twenty battered old trays.\n\nEre entering his pit for the first, Israel had been struck by the\ndismally devil-may-care gestures of the moulders. But hardly had he\nhimself been a moulder three days, when his previous sedateness of\nconcern at his unfortunate lot, began to conform to the reckless sort of\nhalf jolly despair expressed by the others. The truth indeed was, that\nthis continual, violent, helter-skelter slapping of the dough into the\nmoulds, begat a corresponding disposition in the moulder, who, by\nheedlessly slapping that sad dough, as stuff of little worth, was\nthereby taught, in his meditations, to slap, with similar heedlessness,\nhis own sadder fortunes, as of still less vital consideration. To these\nmuddy philosophers, men and bricks were equally of clay. \"What signifies\nwho we be--dukes or ditchers?\" thought the moulders; \"all is vanity and\nclay.\"\n\nSo slap, slap, slap, care-free and negligent, with bitter unconcern,\nthese dismal desperadoes flapped down the dough. If this recklessness\nwere vicious of them, be it so; but their vice was like that weed which\nbut grows on barren ground; enrich the soil, and it disappears.\n\nFor thirteen weary weeks, lorded over by the taskmaster, Israel toiled\nin his pit. Though this condemned him to a sort of earthy dungeon, or\ngravedigger's hole, while he worked, yet even when liberated to his\nmeals, naught of a cheery nature greeted him. The yard was encamped,\nwith all its endless rows of tented sheds, and kilns, and mills, upon a\nwild waste moor, belted round by bogs and fens. The blank horizon, like\na rope, coiled round the whole.\n\nSometimes the air was harsh and bleak; the ridged and mottled sky looked\nscourged, or cramping fogs set in from sea, for leagues around,\nferreting out each rheumatic human bone, and racking it; the sciatic\nlimpers shivered; their aguish rags sponged up the mists. No shelter,\nthough it hailed. The sheds were for the bricks. Unless, indeed,\naccording to the phrase, each man was a \"brick,\" which, in sober\nscripture, was the case; brick is no bad name for any son of Adam; Eden\nwas but a brickyard; what is a mortal but a few luckless shovelfuls of\nclay, moulded in a mould, laid out on a sheet to dry, and ere long\nquickened into his queer caprices by the sun? Are not men built into\ncommunities just like bricks into a wall? Consider the great wall of\nChina: ponder the great populace of Pekin. As man serves bricks, so God\nhim, building him up by billions into edifices of his purposes. Man\nattains not to the nobility of a brick, unless taken in the aggregate.\nYet is there a difference in brick, whether quick or dead; which, for\nthe last, we now shall see.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nCONTINUED.\n\n\nAll night long, men sat before the mouth of the kilns, feeding them with\nfuel. A dull smoke--a smoke of their torments--went up from their tops.\nIt was curious to see the kilns under the action of the fire, gradually\nchanging color, like boiling lobsters. When, at last, the fires would be\nextinguished, the bricks being duly baked, Israel often took a peep into\nthe low vaulted ways at the base, where the flaming fagots had crackled.\nThe bricks immediately lining the vaults would be all burnt to useless\nscrolls, black as charcoal, and twisted into shapes the most grotesque;\nthe next tier would be a little less withered, but hardly fit for\nservice; and gradually, as you went higher and higher along the\nsuccessive layers of the kiln, you came to the midmost ones, sound,\nsquare, and perfect bricks, bringing the highest prices; from these the\ncontents of the kiln gradually deteriorated in the opposite direction,\nupward. But the topmost layers, though inferior to the best, by no means\npresented the distorted look of the furnace-bricks. The furnace-bricks\nwere haggard, with the immediate blistering of the fire--the midmost\nones were ruddy with a genial and tempered glow--the summit ones were\npale with the languor of too exclusive an exemption from the burden of\nthe blaze.\n\nThese kilns were a sort of temporary temples constructed in the yard,\neach brick being set against its neighbor almost with the care taken by\nthe mason. But as soon as the fire was extinguished, down came the kiln\nin a tumbled ruin, carted off to London, once more to be set up in\nambitious edifices, to a true brickyard philosopher, little less\ntransient than the kilns.\n\nSometimes, lading out his dough, Israel could not but bethink him of\nwhat seemed enigmatic in his fate. He whom love of country made a hater\nof her foes--the foreigners among whom he now was thrown--he who, as\nsoldier and sailor, had joined to kill, burn and destroy both them and\ntheirs--here he was at last, serving that very people as a slave, better\nsucceeding in making their bricks than firing their ships. To think that\nhe should be thus helping, with all his strength, to extend the walls of\nthe Thebes of the oppressor, made him half mad. Poor Israel!\nwell-named--bondsman in the English Egypt. But he drowned the thought by\nstill more recklessly spattering with his ladle: \"What signifies who we\nbe, or where we are, or what we do?\" Slap-dash! \"Kings as clowns are\ncodgers--who ain't a nobody?\" Splash! \"All is vanity and clay.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nIN THE CITY OF DIS.\n\n\nAt the end of his brickmaking, our adventurer found himself with a\ntolerable suit of clothes--somewhat darned--on his back, several\nblood-blisters in his palms, and some verdigris coppers in his pocket.\nForthwith, to seek his fortune, he proceeded on foot to the capital,\nentering, like the king, from Windsor, from the Surrey side.\n\nIt was late on a Monday morning, in November--a Blue Monday--a Fifth of\nNovember--Guy Fawkes' Day!--very blue, foggy, doleful and gunpowdery,\nindeed, as shortly will be seen, that Israel found himself wedged in\namong the greatest everyday crowd which grimy London presents to the\ncurious stranger: that hereditary crowd--gulf-stream of humanity--which,\nfor continuous centuries, has never ceased pouring, like an endless\nshoal of herring, over London Bridge.\n\nAt the period here written of, the bridge, specifically known by that\nname, was a singular and sombre pile, built by a cowled monk--Peter of\nColechurch--some five hundred years before. Its arches had long been\ncrowded at the sides with strange old rookeries of disproportioned and\ntoppling height, converting the bridge at once into the most densely\noccupied ward and most jammed thoroughfare of the town, while, as the\nskulls of bullocks are hung out for signs to the gateways of shambles,\nso the withered heads and smoked quarters of traitors, stuck on pikes,\nlong crowned the Southwark entrance.\n\nThough these rookeries, with their grisly heraldry, had been pulled down\nsome twenty years prior to the present visit, still enough of grotesque\nand antiquity clung to the structure at large to render it the most\nstriking of objects, especially to one like our hero, born in a virgin\nclime, where the only antiquities are the forever youthful heavens and\nthe earth.\n\nOn his route from Brentford to Paris, Israel had passed through the\ncapital, but only as a courier; so that now, for the first time, he had\ntime to linger, and loiter, and lounge--slowly absorb what he\nsaw--meditate himself into boundless amazement. For forty years he never\nrecovered from that surprise--never, till dead, had done with his\nwondering.\n\nHung in long, sepulchral arches of stone, the black, besmoked bridge\nseemed a huge scarf of crape, festooning the river across. Similar\nfuneral festoons spanned it to the west, while eastward, towards the\nsea, tiers and tiers of jetty colliers lay moored, side by side, fleets\nof black swans.\n\nThe Thames, which far away, among the green fields of Berks, ran clear\nas a brook, here, polluted by continual vicinity to man, curdled on\nbetween rotten wharves, one murky sheet of sewerage. Fretted by the\nill-built piers, awhile it crested and hissed, then shot balefully\nthrough the Erebus arches, desperate as the lost souls of the harlots,\nwho, every night, took the same plunge. Meantime, here and there, like\nawaiting hearses, the coal-scows drifted along, poled broadside,\npell-mell to the current.\n\nAnd as that tide in the water swept all craft on, so a like tide seemed\nhurrying all men, all horses, all vehicles on the land. As ant-hills,\nthe bridge arches crawled with processions of carts, coaches, drays,\nevery sort of wheeled, rumbling thing, the noses of the horses behind\ntouching the backs of the vehicles in advance, all bespattered with ebon\nmud--ebon mud that stuck like Jews' pitch. At times the mass, receiving\nsome mysterious impulse far in the rear, away among the coiled\nthoroughfares out of sight, would, start forward with a spasmodic surge.\nIt seemed as if some squadron of centaurs, on the thither side of\nPhlegethon, with charge on charge, was driving tormented humanity, with\nall its chattels, across.\n\nWhichever way the eye turned, no tree, no speck of any green thing was\nseen--no more than in smithies. All laborers, of whatsoever sort, were\nhued like the men in foundries. The black vistas of streets were as the\ngalleries in coal mines; the flagging, as flat tomb-stones, minus the\nconsecration of moss, and worn heavily down, by sorrowful tramping, as\nthe vitreous rocks in the cursed Gallipagos, over which the convict\ntortoises crawl.\n\nAs in eclipses, the sun was hidden; the air darkened; the whole dull,\ndismayed aspect of things, as if some neighboring volcano, belching its\npremonitory smoke, were about to whelm the great town, as Herculaneum\nand Pompeii, or the Cities of the Plain. And as they had been upturned\nin terror towards the mountain, all faces were more or less snowed or\nspotted with soot. Nor marble, nor flesh, nor the sad spirit of man, may\nin this cindery City of Dis abide white.\n\nAs retired at length, midway, in a recess of the bridge, Israel surveyed\nthem, various individual aspects all but frighted him. Knowing not who\nthey were; never destined, it may be, to behold them again; one after\nthe other, they drifted by, uninvoked ghosts in Hades. Some of the\nwayfarers wore a less serious look; some seemed hysterically merry; but\nthe mournful faces had an earnestness not seen in the others: because\nman, \"poor player,\" succeeds better in life's tragedy than comedy.\n\nArrived, in the end, on the Middlesex side, Israel's heart was\nprophetically heavy; foreknowing, that being of this race, felicity\ncould never be his lot.\n\nFor five days he wandered and wandered. Without leaving statelier haunts\nunvisited, he did not overlook those broader areas--hereditary parks and\nmanors of vice and misery. Not by constitution disposed to gloom, there\nwas a mysteriousness in those impulses which led him at this time to\nrovings like these. But hereby stoic influences were at work, to fit him\nat a soon-coming day for enacting a part in the last extremities here\nseen; when by sickness, destitution, each busy ill of exile, he was\ndestined to experience a fate, uncommon even to luckless humanity--a\nfate whose crowning qualities were its remoteness from relief and its\ndepth of obscurity--London, adversity, and the sea, three Armageddons,\nwhich, at one and the same time, slay and secrete their victims.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nFORTY-FIVE YEARS.\n\n\nFor the most part, what befell Israel during his forty years wanderings\nin the London deserts, surpassed the forty years in the natural\nwilderness of the outcast Hebrews under Moses.\n\nIn that London fog, went before him the ever-present cloud by day, but\nno pillar of fire by the night, except the cold column of the monument,\ntwo hundred feet beneath the mocking gilt flames on whose top, at the\nstone base, the shiverer, of midnight, often laid down.\n\nBut these experiences, both from their intensity and his solitude, were\nnecessarily squalid. Best not enlarge upon them. For just as extreme\nsuffering, without hope, is intolerable to the victim, so, to others, is\nits depiction without some corresponding delusive mitigation. The\ngloomiest and truthfulest dramatist seldom chooses for his theme the\ncalamities, however extraordinary, of inferior and private persons;\nleast of all, the pauper's; admonished by the fact, that to the craped\npalace of the king lying in state, thousands of starers shall throng;\nbut few feel enticed to the shanty, where, like a pealed knuckle-bone,\ngrins the unupholstered corpse of the beggar.\n\nWhy at one given stone in the flagging does man after man cross yonder\nstreet? What plebeian Lear or Oedipus, what Israel Potter, cowers there\nby the corner they shun? From this turning point, then, we too cross\nover and skim events to the end; omitting the particulars of the\nstarveling's wrangling with rats for prizes in the sewers; or his\ncrawling into an abandoned doorless house in St. Giles', where his hosts\nwere three dead men, one pendant; into another of an alley nigh\nHoundsditch, where the crazy hovel, in phosphoric rottenness, fell\nsparkling on him one pitchy midnight, and he received that injury,\nwhich, excluding activity for no small part of the future, was an added\ncause of his prolongation of exile, besides not leaving his faculties\nunaffected by the concussion of one of the rafters on his brain.\n\nBut these were some of the incidents not belonging to the beginning of\nhis career. On the contrary, a sort of humble prosperity attended him\nfor a time; insomuch that once he was not without hopes of being able to\nbuy his homeward passage so soon as the war should end. But, as stubborn\nfate would have it, being run over one day at Holborn Bars, and taken\ninto a neighboring bakery, he was there treated with such kindliness by\na Kentish lass, the shop-girl, that in the end he thought his debt of\ngratitude could only be repaid by love. In a word, the money saved up\nfor his ocean voyage was lavished upon a rash embarkation in wedlock.\n\nOriginally he had fled to the capital to avoid the dilemma of\nimpressment or imprisonment. In the absence of other motives, the dread\nof those hardships would have fixed him there till the peace. But now,\nwhen hostilities were no more, so was his money. Some period elapsed ere\nthe affairs of the two governments were put on such a footing as to\nsupport an American consul at London. Yet, when this came to pass, he\ncould only embrace the facilities for a return here furnished, by\ndeserting a wife and child, wedded and born in the enemy's land.\n\nThe peace immediately filled England, and more especially London, with\nhordes of disbanded soldiers; thousands of whom, rather than starve, or\nturn highwaymen (which no few of their comrades did, stopping coaches at\ntimes in the most public streets), would work for such a pittance as to\nbring down the wages of all the laboring classes. Neither was our\nadventurer the least among the sufferers. Driven out of his previous\nemploy--a sort of porter in a river-side warehouse--by this sudden\ninflux of rivals, destitute, honest men like himself, with the ingenuity\nof his race, he turned his hand to the village art of chair-bottoming.\nAn itinerant, he paraded the streets with the cry of \"Old chairs to\nmend!\" furnishing a curious illustration of the contradictions of human\nlife; that he who did little but trudge, should be giving cosy seats to\nall the rest of the world. Meantime, according to another well-known\nMalthusian enigma in human affairs, his family increased. In all, eleven\nchildren were born to him in certain sixpenny garrets in Moorfields. One\nafter the other, ten were buried.\n\nWhen chair-bottoming would fail, resort was had to match-making. That\nbusiness being overdone in turn, next came the cutting of old rags, bits\nof paper, nails, and broken glass. Nor was this the last step. From the\ngutter he slid to the sewer. The slope was smooth. In poverty--\"Facilis\ndescensus Averni.\"\n\nBut many a poor soldier had sloped down there into the boggy canal of\nAvernus before him. Nay, he had three corporals and a sergeant for\ncompany.\n\nBut his lot was relieved by two strange things, presently to appear. In\n1793 war again broke out, the great French war. This lighted London of\nsome of its superfluous hordes, and lost Israel the subterranean society\nof his friends, the corporals and sergeant, with whom wandering forlorn\nthrough the black kingdoms of mud, he used to spin yarns about sea\nprisoners in hulks, and listen to stories of the Black Hole of Calcutta;\nand often would meet other pairs of poor soldiers, perfect strangers, at\nthe more public corners and intersections of sewers--the Charing-Crosses\nbelow; one soldier having the other by his remainder button, earnestly\ndiscussing the sad prospects of a rise in bread, or the tide; while\nthrough the grating of the gutters overhead, the rusty skylights of the\nrealm, came the hoarse rumblings of bakers' carts, with splashes of the\nflood whereby these unsuspected gnomes of the city lived.\n\nEncouraged by the exodus of the lost tribes of soldiers, Israel returned\nto chair-bottoming. And it was in frequenting Covent-Garden market, at\nearly morning, for the purchase of his flags, that he experienced one\nof the strange alleviations hinted of above. That chatting with the\nruddy, aproned, hucksterwomen, on whose moist cheeks yet trickled the\ndew of the dawn on the meadows; that being surrounded by bales of hay,\nas the raker by cocks and ricks in the field; those glimpses of garden\nproduce, the blood-beets, with the damp earth still tufting the roots;\nthat mere handling of his flags, and bethinking him of whence they must\nhave come, the green hedges through which the wagon that brought them\nhad passed; that trudging home with them as a gleaner with his sheaf of\nwheat;--all this was inexpressibly grateful. In want and bitterness,\npent in, perforce, between dingy walls, he had rural returns of his\nboyhood's sweeter days among them; and the hardest stones of his\nsolitary heart (made hard by bare endurance alone) would feel the stir\nof tender but quenchless memories, like the grass of deserted flagging,\nupsprouting through its closest seams. Sometimes, when incited by some\nlittle incident, however trivial in itself, thoughts of home\nwould--either by gradually working and working upon him, or else by an\nimpetuous rush of recollection--overpower him for a time to a sort of\nhallucination.\n\nThus was it:--One fair half-day in the July of 1800, by good luck, he\nwas employed, partly out of charity, by one of the keepers, to trim the\nsward in an oval enclosure within St. James' Park, a little green but a\nthree-minutes' walk along the gravelled way from the brick-besmoked and\ngrimy Old Brewery of the palace which gives its ancient name to the\npublic resort on whose borders it stands. It was a little oval, fenced\nin with iron pailings, between whose bars the imprisoned verdure peered\nforth, as some wild captive creature of the woods from its cage. And\nalien Israel there--at times staring dreamily about him--seemed like\nsome amazed runaway steer, or trespassing Pequod Indian, impounded on\nthe shores of Narraganset Bay, long ago; and back to New England our\nexile was called in his soul. For still working, and thinking of home;\nand thinking of home, and working amid the verdant quietude of this\nlittle oasis, one rapt thought begat another, till at last his mind\nsettled intensely, and yet half humorously, upon the image of Old\nHuckleberry, his mother's favorite old pillion horse; and, ere long,\nhearing a sudden scraping noise (some hob-shoe without, against the iron\npailing), he insanely took it to be Old Huckleberry in his stall,\nhailing him (Israel) with his shod fore-foot clattering against the\nplanks--his customary trick when hungry--and so, down goes Israel's\nhook, and with a tuft of white clover, impulsively snatched, he hurries\naway a few paces in obedience to the imaginary summons. But soon\nstopping midway, and forlornly gazing round at the enclosure, he\nbethought him that a far different oval, the great oval of the ocean,\nmust be crossed ere his crazy errand could be done; and even then, Old\nHuckleberry would be found long surfeited with clover, since, doubtless,\nbeing dead many a summer, he must be buried beneath it. And many years\nafter, in a far different part of the town, and in far less winsome\nweather too, passing with his bundle of flags through Red-Cross street,\ntowards Barbican, in a fog so dense that the dimmed and massed blocks\nof houses, exaggerated by the loom, seemed shadowy ranges on ranges of\nmidnight hills, he heard a confused pastoral sort of sounds--tramplings,\nlowings, halloos--and was suddenly called to by a voice to head off\ncertain cattle, bound to Smithfield, bewildered and unruly in the fog.\nNext instant he saw the white face--white as an orange-blossom--of a\nblack-bodied steer, in advance of the drove, gleaming ghost-like through\nthe vapors; and presently, forgetting his limp, with rapid shout and\ngesture, he was more eager, even than the troubled farmers, their\nowners, in driving the riotous cattle back into Barbican. Monomaniac\nreminiscences were in him--\"To the right, to the right!\" he shouted, as,\narrived at the street corner, the farmers beat the drove to the left,\ntowards Smithfield: \"To the right! you are driving them back to the\npastures--to the right! that way lies the barn-yard!\" \"Barn-yard?\" cried\na voice; \"you are dreaming, old man.\" And so, Israel, now an old man,\nwas bewitched by the mirage of vapors; he had dreamed himself home into\nthe mists of the Housatonic mountains; ruddy boy on the upland pastures\nagain. But how different the flat, apathetic, dead, London fog now\nseemed from those agile mists which, goat-like, climbed the purple\npeaks, or in routed armies of phantoms, broke down, pell-mell, dispersed\nin flight upon the plain, leaving the cattle-boy loftily alone,\nclear-cut as a balloon against the sky.\n\nIn 1817 he once more endured extremity; this second peace again drifting\nits discharged soldiers on London, so that all kinds of labor were\noverstocked. Beggars, too, lighted on the walks like locusts.\nTimber-toed cripples stilted along, numerous as French peasants in\n_sabots_. And, as thirty years before, on all sides, the exile had heard\nthe supplicatory cry, not addressed to him, \"An honorable scar, your\nhonor, received at Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Trenton, fighting for\nhis most gracious Majesty, King George!\" so now, in presence of the\nstill surviving Israel, our Wandering Jew, the amended cry was anew\ntaken up, by a succeeding generation of unfortunates, \"An honorable\nscar, your honor, received at Corunna, or at Waterloo, or at Trafalgar!\"\nYet not a few of these petitioners had never been outside of the London\nsmoke; a sort of crafty aristocracy in their way, who, without having\nendangered their own persons much if anything, reaped no insignificant\nshare both of the glory and profit of the bloody battles they claimed;\nwhile some of the genuine working heroes, too brave to beg, too cut-up\nto work, and too poor to live, laid down quietly in corners and died.\nAnd here it may be noted, as a fact nationally characteristic, that\nhowever desperately reduced at times, even to the sewers, Israel, the\nAmerican, never sunk below the mud, to actual beggary.\n\nThough henceforth elbowed out of many a chance threepenny job by the\nadded thousands who contended with him against starvation, nevertheless,\nsomehow he continued to subsist, as those tough old oaks of the cliffs,\nwhich, though hacked at by hail-stones of tempests, and even wantonly\nmaimed by the passing woodman, still, however cramped by rival trees and\nfettered by rocks, succeed, against all odds, in keeping the vital\nnerve of the tap-root alive. And even towards the end, in his dismallest\nDecember, our veteran could still at intervals feel a momentary warmth\nin his topmost boughs. In his Moorfields' garret, over a handful of\nreignited cinders (which the night before might have warmed some lord),\ncinders raked up from the streets, he would drive away dolor, by talking\nwith his one only surviving, and now motherless child--the spared\nBenjamin of his old age--of the far Canaan beyond the sea; rehearsing to\nthe lad those well-remembered adventures among New England hills, and\npainting scenes of rustling happiness and plenty, in which the lowliest\nshared. And here, shadowy as it was, was the second alleviation hinted\nof above.\n\nTo these tales of the Fortunate Isles of the Free, recounted by one who\nhad been there, the poor enslaved boy of Moorfields listened, night\nafter night, as to the stories of Sinbad the Sailor. When would his\nfather take him there? \"Some day to come, my boy,\" would be the hopeful\nresponse of an unhoping heart. And \"Would God it were to-morrow!\" would\nbe the impassioned reply.\n\nIn these talks Israel unconsciously sowed the seeds of his eventual\nreturn. For with added years, the boy felt added longing to escape his\nentailed misery, by compassing for his father and himself a voyage to\nthe Promised Land. By his persevering efforts he succeeded at last,\nagainst every obstacle, in gaining credit in the right quarter to his\nextraordinary statements. In short, charitably stretching a technical\npoint, the American Consul finally saw father and son embarked in the\nThames for Boston.\n\nIt was the year 1826; half a century since Israel, in early manhood, had\nsailed a prisoner in the Tartar frigate from the same port to which he\nnow was bound. An octogenarian as he recrossed the brine, he showed\nlocks besnowed as its foam. White-haired old Ocean seemed as a brother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nREQUIESCAT IN PACE.\n\n\nIt happened that the ship, gaining her port, was moored to the dock on a\nFourth of July; and half an hour after landing, hustled by the riotous\ncrowd near Faneuil Hall, the old man narrowly escaped being run over by\na patriotic triumphal car in the procession, flying a broidered banner,\ninscribed with gilt letters:\n\n\"BUNKER-HILL\n\n1775.\n\nGLORY TO THE HEROES THAT FOUGHT!\"\n\nIt was on Copps' Hill, within the city bounds, one of the enemy's\npositions during the fight, that our wanderer found his best repose that\nday. Sitting down here on a mound in the graveyard, he looked off across\nCharles River towards the battle-ground, whose incipient monument, at\nthat period, was hard to see, as a struggling sprig of corn in a chilly\nspring. Upon those heights, fifty years before, his now feeble hands had\nwielded both ends of the musket. There too he had received that slit\nupon the chest, which afterwards, in the affair with the Serapis, being\ntraversed by a cutlass wound, made him now the bescarred bearer of a\ncross.\n\nFor a long time he sat mute, gazing blankly about him. The sultry July\nday was waning. His son sought to cheer him a little ere rising to\nreturn to the lodging for the present assigned them by the ship-captain.\n\"Nay,\" replied the old man, \"I shall get no fitter rest than here by the\nmounds.\"\n\nBut from this true \"Potter's Field,\" the boy at length drew him away;\nand encouraged next morning by a voluntary purse made up among the\nreassembled passengers, father and son started by stage for the country\nof the Housatonie. But the exile's presence in these old mountain\ntownships proved less a return than a resurrection. At first, none knew\nhim, nor could recall having heard of him. Ere long it was found, that\nmore than thirty years previous, the last known survivor of his family\nin that region, a bachelor, following the example of three-fourths of\nhis neighbors, had sold out and removed to a distant country in the\nwest; where exactly, none could say.\n\nHe sought to get a glimpse of his father's homestead. But it had been\nburnt down long ago. Accompanied by his son, dim-eyed and dim-hearted,\nhe next went to find the site. But the roads had years before been\nchanged. The old road was now browsed over by sheep; the new one ran\nstraight through what had formerly been orchards. But new orchards,\nplanted from other suckers, and in time grafted, throve on sunny slopes\nnear by, where blackberries had once been picked by the bushel. At\nlength he came to a field waving with buckwheat. It seemed one of those\nfields which himself had often reaped. But it turned out, upon inquiry,\nthat but three summers since a walnut grove had stood there. Then he\nvaguely remembered that his father had sometimes talked of planting such\na grove, to defend the neighboring fields against the cold north wind;\nyet where precisely that grove was to have been, his shattered mind\ncould not recall. But it seemed not unlikely that during his long exile,\nthe walnut grove had been planted and harvested, as well as the annual\ncrops preceding and succeeding it, on the very same soil.\n\nEre long, on the mountain side, he passed into an ancient natural wood,\nwhich seemed some way familiar, and midway in it, paused to contemplate\na strange, mouldy pile, resting at one end against a sturdy beech.\nThough wherever touched by his staff, however lightly, this pile would\ncrumble, yet here and there, even in powder, it preserved the exact\nlook, each irregularly defined line, of what it had originally\nbeen--namely, a half-cord of stout hemlock (one of the woods least\naffected by exposure to the air), in a foregoing generation chopped and\nstacked up on the spot, against sledging-time, but, as sometimes happens\nin such cases, by subsequent oversight, abandoned to oblivious\ndecay--type now, as it stood there, of forever arrested intentions, and\na long life still rotting in early mishap.\n\n\"Do I dream?\" mused the bewildered old man, \"or what is this vision\nthat comes to me of a cold, cloudy morning, long, long ago, and I\nheaving yon elbowed log against the beech, then a sapling? Nay, nay, I\ncannot be so old.\"\n\n\"Come away, father, from this dismal, damp wood,\" said his son, and led\nhim forth.\n\nBlindly ranging to and fro, they next saw a man ploughing. Advancing\nslowly, the wanderer met him by a little heap of ruinous burnt masonry,\nlike a tumbled chimney, what seemed the jams of the fire-place, now\naridly stuck over here and there, with thin, clinging, round,\nprohibitory mosses, like executors' wafers. Just as the oxen were bid\nstand, the stranger's plough was hitched over sideways, by sudden\ncontact with some sunken stone at the ruin's base.\n\n\"There, this is the twentieth year my plough has struck this old\nhearthstone. Ah, old man,--sultry day, this.\"\n\n\"Whose house stood here, friend?\" said the wanderer, touching the\nhalf-buried hearth with his staff, where a fresh furrow overlapped it.\n\n\"Don't know; forget the name; gone West, though, I believe. You know\n'em?\"\n\nBut the wanderer made no response; his eye was now fixed on a curious\nnatural bend or wave in one of the bemossed stone jambs.\n\n\"What are you looking at so, father?\"\n\n\"'_Father_!' Here,\" raking with his staff, \"_my_ father would sit, and\nhere, my mother, and here I, little infant, would totter between, even\nas now, once again, on the very same spot, but in the unroofed air, I\ndo. The ends meet. Plough away, friend.\"\n\nBest followed now is this life, by hurrying, like itself, to a close.\n\nFew things remain.\n\nHe was repulsed in efforts after a pension by certain caprices of law.\nHis scars proved his only medals. He dictated a little book, the record\nof his fortunes. But long ago it faded out of print--himself out of\nbeing--his name out of memory. He died the same day that the oldest oak\non his native hills was blown down.\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Israel Potter, by Herman Melville\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ISRAEL POTTER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 15422-8.txt or 15422-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/5\/4\/2\/15422\/\n\nProduced by Dave Maddock, Mary Meehan and the PG Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":566,"split":"train"}
