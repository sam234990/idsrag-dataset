{"ori_id":"790e4567fa3788b2a778212e7321b3a1e1cbbe57","title":"Coriolanus (film)","context":"Coriolanus (film)\n In a contemporary day alternate version of Rome, riots are in progress after stores of grain are withheld from citizens and civil liberties are reduced due to a war between Rome and neighbouring Volsci. The rioters are particularly angry at Caius Martius (Ralph Fiennes), a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the city's problems. During a march, the rioters encounter Martius, who is openly contemptuous and does not hide his low opinion of the regular citizens. The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler), who has fought Martius on several occasions and considers him a mortal enemy, swears that the next time they meet in battle will be the last. Martius leads a raid against the Volscian city of Corioles and during the siege, with much of Martius's unit being killed, Martius gathers reinforcements and the Romans take the city. After the battle, Martius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which results in both men being wounded but ends when Aufidius' soldiers drag him away from the fight.\nMartius returns to Rome victorious and in recognition of his great courage, General Cominius (John Kani) gives him the agnomen of \"Coriolanus\". Coriolanus's mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) encourages her son to run for consul within the Roman Senate. Coriolanus is reluctant but he eventually agrees to his mother's wishes. He easily wins the Roman Senate and seems at first to have won over the commoners as well due to his military victories. Two tribunes, Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt), are critical of his entrance into politics, fearing that his popularity would lead to Coriolanus taking power away from the Senate for himself. They scheme to undo Coriolanus and so stir up another riot in opposition to him becoming consul. When they call Coriolanus a traitor, Coriolanus bursts into rage and openly attacks the concept of popular rule as well as the citizens of Rome, demonstrating that he still holds the plebeians in contempt. He compares allowing citizens to have power over the senators as to allowing \"crows to peck the eagles\". The tribunes term Coriolanus a traitor for his words and order him banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who will banish Rome from his presence: \"There is a world elsewhere\".\nAfter being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of Antium and offers to let Aufidius kill him, to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus and allow him to lead a new assault on the city, so that he can claim vengeance on the city which he feels betrayed him. Coriolanus and Aufidius lead a Voscilian attack on Rome. Panicked, Rome sends General Titus to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance; when Titus reports his failure, Senator Menenius (Brian Cox) follows but is also shunned. In response, Menenius, who has seemingly lost all hope in Coriolanus and Rome, commits suicide by a river bank. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet with her son, along with Coriolanus' wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) and his son. Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome and Coriolanus makes peace between the Volscians and the Romans alongside General Cominius. When Coriolanus returns to the Volscian border, he is confronted by Aufidius and his men, who now also brand him as a traitor. They call him Martius and refuse to call him by his \"stolen name\" of Coriolanus. Aufidius explains to Coriolanus how he put aside his hatred so that they could conquer Rome but now that Coriolanus has prevented this, he has betrayed the promise between them. For this betrayal, Aufidius and his men attack and kill Coriolanus.\n<html>\n<head><title>Coriolanus Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Coriolanus script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Coriolanus script, Coriolanus movie script, Coriolanus film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

She is beautiful and graceful\n          but -- like Diana thrown into lion's den of the Windsor\n          family -- woefully out of her depth. We feel an inner\n          fragility to her.\n          The room is spacious and elegantly appointed. A lovely Roman\n          statue in one corner.

An imposing piece of outdated modern\n          art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like\n          a bird of prey.\n          Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner.\n          Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos\n          are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows\n          of SENATORS.\n          Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:\n\n<b>                         MENENIUS\n<\/b>          Therefore, please you,\n          Most reverend and grave elders, to desire\n          The present Consul, and last general\n          In our well-found successes, to report\n          A little of that worthy work performed\n          By Caius Martius Coriolanus.\n\n<b>                         SENATOR\n<\/b>          Speak, good Cominius.\n          General Cominius rises and moves to the podium.\n          But then Coriolanus abruptly stands--\n\n<b>                         MENENIUS\n<\/b>          Nay, keep your place.\n\n<b>                         SENATOR\n<\/b>          Sit, Coriolanus.

Music\n          droning from a radio.\n          Aufidius, his Lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting\n          outside the dusty diner.\n          The men with Aufidius are thugs and killers, the most brutal\n          Volsces he could find. We note a couple of Coriolanus'\n          Acolytes among them. They have turned with great venom on\n          their hero.\n          They are like a mafia hit squad, waiting for Coriolanus to\n          return with the peace treaty.\n          Aufidius is deep in thought.\n          His Lieutenant breaks the silence:\n\n<b>                         LIEUTENANT\n<\/b>          How is it with our general?\n\n<b>                         AUFIDIUS\n<\/b>          As with a man by his own charity slain.\n\n<b>                         LIEUTENANT\n<\/b>          Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst\n          'Twixt you there's difference; but the\n\n<b>                         (MORE)\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>          102.\n<\/b>\n<b>                         LIEUTENANT (CANT'D)\n<\/b>          fall of either\n          Makes the survivor heir of all.\n\n<b>                         AUFIDIUS\n<\/b>          I know it,\n          And my pretext to strike at him admits\n          A good construction.\n          A beat.

They stand, stretch and prepare.\n          The truck stops across the highway from them and Coriolanus\n          gets out. He holds a copy of the peace treaty in a leather\n          portfolio.

A sort of\n          acceptance. He knows his time is past.\n          Aufidius and the thugs go to meet him. The thugs spread out a\n          bit, strategically, getting ready to strike.
