{"ori_id":"ce8cb184a11535e7a7c824c82b7772a1c3a7c92c","title":"Amour (2012 film)","context":"Amour (2012 film)\n After residents of an apartment building complain of a weird smell coming from one of the apartments, the brigade of firemen and police break down the door of the apartment in Paris to find the corpse of Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) lying on a bed, adorned with cut flowers.\nThe film goes back to several months before the opening scene, and Anne and her husband Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), both retired piano teachers in their eighties, attend a performance by one of Anne's former pupils, Alexandre. They return home to find that someone has unsuccessfully tried to break in to their apartment. The next morning while they are eating breakfast, Anne silently suffers a stroke. She sits in a catatonic state, not responding to Georges. She comes around as Georges is about to get help, but doesn't remember anything that took place. Georges thinks she was playing a prank on him. Anne is unable to pour herself a drink.\nAnne undergoes surgery on a blocked carotid artery, but the surgery goes wrong, leaving her paralyzed on her right side and confined to a wheelchair. She makes Georges promise not to send her back to the hospital or into a nursing home. Georges becomes Anne's dutiful, though slightly irritated, caretaker. One day, Anne tells Georges that she doesn't want to go on living.\nAlexandre, her former pupil whose performance they attended, stops by and Anne gets dressed up and carries on a lively conversation during the visit, giving Georges hope that her condition was temporary. However, she soon suffers a second stroke that leaves her demented and incapable of coherent speech. Georges continues to look after Anne, despite the strain it puts on him.\nGeorges begins employing a nurse three days a week. Their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), wants her mother to go into care, but Georges says he will not break the promise he made to his wife. He employs a second nurse, but fires her after he discovers she is mistreating his wife.\nOne day, Georges sits next to Anne's bedside and tells her a story of his childhood, which calms her. As he reaches the story's conclusion, he picks up a pillow and smothers her.\nGeorges returns home with bundles of flowers in his hands, which he proceeds to wash and cut. He picks out a dress from Anne's wardrobe and writes a long letter. He tapes the bedroom door shut and catches a pigeon which has flown in from the window. In the letter, Georges explains that he has released the pigeon. Georges imagines that Anne is washing dishes in the kitchen and, speechless, he gazes at her as she cleans up and prepares to leave the house. Anne calls for Georges to bring a coat, and he complies, following her out the door.\nThe film concludes with a continuation of the opening scene, with Eva seated in the living room, after she has wandered around the now-empty home.\n<html>\n<head><title>Amour Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Amour script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Amour script, Amour movie script, Amour film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

They all\n          wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.\n          Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their\n          way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,\n          the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional\n          flyers.

They go\n          to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once\n          everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking\n          people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught\n          with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the\n          lights go out. APPLAUSE.\n                         \n          Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS\n          ARE CLEARED here and there.

Here we go: when I was\n           little... well, I wasn't as little\n           as all that... it was toward the\n           end of primary school, so I was\n           about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a\n           holiday camp. They thought it would\n           do me good to spend the summer with\n           kids my own age... We were lodged\n           in an old castle in the midst of a\n           magnificent wooded landscape... I\n           think it was in the Auvergne... I\n           don't know... in any case it was\n           the opposite of what I'd\n           expected... We had to get up at 6\n           and go for a morning swim. Not far\n           from the castle, there was a pond\n           fed by an icy mountain stream. We\n           entered it running, in a double\n           file. You know, I was never very\n           sporty. They had a program to keep\n           us on the go all day, probably to\n           nip any potential pubescent\n           impulses in the bud ... But the\n           worst thing was the food. The third\n           day after our arrival, there was\n           rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice\n           pudding. We sat at long tables in a\n           huge hall. I didn't want to eat the\n           stuff and the housemaster said to\n           me: You won't get up until you've\n           cleared your plate. So after the\n           meal everybody left the room, and I\n           remained seated, in tears. I had\n           made a secret pact with Mom. I was\n           to send her a postcard every week.\n<b>                          (MORE)\n<\/b><b>           64.\n<\/b>                         \n<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           If I was pleased with the place I\n           was to draw some flowers on it, or\n           if not, some stars. She kept the\n           card; it was covered all over in\n           stars. After three hours, I was\n           allowed to leave the table. I went\n           up to my room, got into bed and had\n           a fever of 42 degrees. It was\n           diphtheria. They took me to the\n           nearest hospital where I was put in\n           an isolation ward, which meant that\n           Mom, when she came to visit me,\n           could only wave at me through a\n           window. At some point I lost that\n           postcard. It's a pity.\n                         \n          Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story.

STIFLED SOUNDS from\n          Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to\n          move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it\n          with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's\n          movements stop.

When she comes out\n          again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it\n          on.\n                         \n<b>                          ANNE\n<\/b>           Thanks.\n                         \n          They head for the front door.\n                         \n<b>                          ANNE (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Aren't you taking a coat?\n                         \n          Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from\n          the hook and they leave the apartment.\n                         \n<b>          SCENE 61 - INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM\n<\/b><b>                         - DAY\n<\/b>                         \n          Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is\n          shining. It is fairly bright.\n                         \n          Hallway.\n                         \n          SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes\n          into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.\n          Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes\n          into the bedroom.\n<b>           67.\n<\/b>                         \n                         \n          Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies\n          only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes\n          through the partition door into the dining room.\n                         \n          There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living\n          room.\n                         \n          There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano\n          stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she\n          heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the\n          table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,\n          turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear\n          STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the\n          armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.\n                         \n          END CREDITS (white on a black background)\n<b>                          \n<\/b>\n<\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Amour.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Amour<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Michael Haneke\" title=\"Scripts by Michael Haneke\">Michael Haneke<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Amour Script.html#comments\" title=\"Amour comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":894,"split":"train"}
