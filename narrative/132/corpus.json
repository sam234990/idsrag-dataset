{"ori_id":"1c64744acb7e41887938c2e9b0cf6b2f85e92921","title":"The Iron Heel","context":"The Iron Heel\n The novel is based on the (fictional) \"Everhard Manuscript\" written by Avis Everhard which she hid and which was subsequently found centuries later. In addition, this novel has an introduction and series of (often lengthy) footnotes written from the perspective of scholar Anthony Meredith. Meredith writes from around 2600 AD or 419 B.O.M. (the Brotherhood of Man). Jack London writes at two levels, often having Meredith condescendingly correcting the errors of Everhard yet, at the same time, exposing the often incomplete understanding of this distant future perspective.\nMeredith's introduction also acts as a deliberate \"spoiler\" (the term did not yet exist at the time of writing). Before ever getting a chance to get to know Avis and Ernest, how they fell in love or how Avis became politically involved, the reader is already told that all their struggles and hopes would end in total failure and repression, and that both of them would be summarily executed. This gives all that follows the air of a foreordained tragedy. There is still left the consolation that a happy end would come for humanity as a whole\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 though hundreds of years too late for Avis and Ernest as individuals; the cruel oligarchy would fall, and the two will be vindicated and respected by posterity as pioneers and martyrs.\nThe Manuscript itself covers the years 1912 through 1932 in which the Oligarchy (or \"Iron Heel\") arose in the United States. In Asia, Japan conquered East Asia and created its own empire, India gained independence, and Europe became socialist. Canada, Mexico, and Cuba formed their own Oligarchies and were aligned with the U.S. (London remains silent as to the fates of South America, Africa, and the Middle East.)\nIn North America, the Oligarchy maintains power for three centuries until the Revolution succeeds and ushers in the Brotherhood of Man. During the years of the novel, the First Revolt is described and preparations for the Second Revolt are discussed. From the perspective of Everhard, the imminent Second Revolt is sure to succeed but, from the distant future perspective of Meredith, we readers realize that Everhard's hopes were to be crushed for centuries to come.\nThe Oligarchy are the largest monopoly trusts (or robber barons) who manage to squeeze out the middle class by bankrupting most small to mid-sized business as well as reducing all farmers to effective serfdom. This Oligarchy maintains power through a \"labor caste\" and the Mercenaries. Labor in essential industries like steel and rail are elevated and given decent wages, housing, and education. Indeed, the tragic turn in the novel (and Jack London's core warning to his contemporaries) is the treachery of these favored unions which break with the other unions and side with the Oligarchy. Further, a second, military caste is formed: the Mercenaries. The Mercenaries are officially the army of the US but are in fact in the employ of the Oligarchs.\nAsgard is the name of a fictional wonder-city, a city constructed by the Oligarchy to be admired and appreciated as well as lived in. Thousands of proletarians live in poverty there, and are used whenever a public work needs to be completed, such as the building of levee or a canal.\nThe Manuscript is Everhard's autobiography as she tells of: her privileged childhood as the daughter of an accomplished scientist; her marriage to the socialist revolutionary Ernest Everhard; the fall of the US republic; and her years in the underground resistance from the First Revolt through the years leading to the Second Revolt. By telling the story of Avis Everhard, the novel is essentially an adventurous tale heavily strewn with social commentary of an alternate future (from a 1907 perspective). However, the future perspective of the scholar Meredith deepens the tragic plight of Everhard and her revolutionary comrades.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Iron Heel, by Jack London\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

To the historian it bristles with errors--not\nerrors of fact, but errors of interpretation. Looking back across the\nseven centuries that have lapsed since Avis Everhard completed her\nmanuscript, events, and the bearings of events, that were confused and\nveiled to her, are clear to us. She lacked perspective. She was too\nclose to the events she writes about. Nay, she was merged in the events\nshe has described.\n\nNevertheless, as a personal document, the Everhard Manuscript is of\ninestimable value. But here again enter error of perspective, and\nvitiation due to the bias of love. Yet we smile, indeed, and forgive\nAvis Everhard for the heroic lines upon which she modelled her husband.\nWe know to-day that he was not so colossal, and that he loomed among the\nevents of his times less largely than the Manuscript would lead us to\nbelieve.\n\nWe know that Ernest Everhard was an exceptionally strong man, but not so\nexceptional as his wife thought him to be. He was, after all, but one of\na large number of heroes who, throughout the world, devoted their lives\nto the Revolution; though it must be conceded that he did unusual\nwork, especially in his elaboration and interpretation of working-class\nphilosophy. \"Proletarian science\" and \"proletarian philosophy\" were his\nphrases for it, and therein he shows the provincialism of his mind--a\ndefect, however, that was due to the times and that none in that day\ncould escape.\n\nBut to return to the Manuscript. Especially valuable is it in\ncommunicating to us the FEEL of those terrible times. Nowhere do we find\nmore vividly portrayed the psychology of the persons that lived in\nthat turbulent period embraced between the years 1912 and 1932--their\nmistakes and ignorance, their doubts and fears and misapprehensions,\ntheir ethical delusions, their violent passions, their inconceivable\nsordidness and selfishness. These are the things that are so hard for\nus of this enlightened age to understand. History tells us that these\nthings were, and biology and psychology tell us why they were; but\nhistory and biology and psychology do not make these things alive. We\naccept them as facts, but we are left without sympathetic comprehension\nof them.\n\nThis sympathy comes to us, however, as we peruse the Everhard\nManuscript. We enter into the minds of the actors in that long-ago\nworld-drama, and for the time being their mental processes are our\nmental processes. Not alone do we understand Avis Everhard's love for\nher hero-husband, but we feel, as he felt, in those first days, the\nvague and terrible loom of the Oligarchy. The Iron Heel (well named) we\nfeel descending upon and crushing mankind.\n\nAnd in passing we note that that historic phrase, the Iron Heel,\noriginated in Ernest Everhard's mind. This, we may say, is the one moot\nquestion that this new-found document clears up. Previous to this, the\nearliest-known use of the phrase occurred in the pamphlet, \"Ye Slaves,\"\nwritten by George Milford and published in December, 1912. This George\nMilford was an obscure agitator about whom nothing is known, save the\none additional bit of information gained from the Manuscript, which\nmentions that he was shot in the Chicago Commune. Evidently he had\nheard Ernest Everhard make use of the phrase in some public speech, most\nprobably when he was running for Congress in the fall of 1912. From the\nManuscript we learn that Everhard used the phrase at a private dinner\nin the spring of 1912. This is, without discussion, the earliest-known\noccasion on which the Oligarchy was so designated.\n\nThe rise of the Oligarchy will always remain a cause of secret wonder\nto the historian and the philosopher. Other great historical events\nhave their place in social evolution. They were inevitable. Their coming\ncould have been predicted with the same certitude that astronomers\nto-day predict the outcome of the movements of stars. Without these\nother great historical events, social evolution could not have\nproceeded. Primitive communism, chattel slavery, serf slavery, and wage\nslavery were necessary stepping-stones in the evolution of society.\nBut it were ridiculous to assert that the Iron Heel was a necessary\nstepping-stone. Rather, to-day, is it adjudged a step aside, or a step\nbackward, to the social tyrannies that made the early world a hell, but\nthat were as necessary as the Iron Heel was unnecessary.\n\nBlack as Feudalism was, yet the coming of it was inevitable. What else\nthan Feudalism could have followed upon the breakdown of that great\ncentralized governmental machine known as the Roman Empire? Not\nso, however, with the Iron Heel. In the orderly procedure of social\nevolution there was no place for it. It was not necessary, and it was\nnot inevitable. It must always remain the great curiosity of history--a\nwhim, a fantasy, an apparition, a thing unexpected and undreamed; and\nit should serve as a warning to those rash political theorists of to-day\nwho speak with certitude of social processes.\n\nCapitalism was adjudged by the sociologists of the time to be the\nculmination of bourgeois rule, the ripened fruit of the bourgeois\nrevolution. And we of to-day can but applaud that judgment. Following\nupon Capitalism, it was held, even by such intellectual and antagonistic\ngiants as Herbert Spencer, that Socialism would come. Out of the decay\nof self-seeking capitalism, it was held, would arise that flower of the\nages, the Brotherhood of Man. Instead of which, appalling alike to\nus who look back and to those that lived at the time, capitalism,\nrotten-ripe, sent forth that monstrous offshoot, the Oligarchy.\n\nToo late did the socialist movement of the early twentieth century\ndivine the coming of the Oligarchy. Even as it was divined, the\nOligarchy was there--a fact established in blood, a stupendous and awful\nreality. Nor even then, as the Everhard Manuscript well shows, was any\npermanence attributed to the Iron Heel. Its overthrow was a matter of\na few short years, was the judgment of the revolutionists. It is true,\nthey realized that the Peasant Revolt was unplanned, and that the First\nRevolt was premature; but they little realized that the Second Revolt,\nplanned and mature, was doomed to equal futility and more terrible\npunishment.\n\nIt is apparent that Avis Everhard completed the Manuscript during the\nlast days of preparation for the Second Revolt; hence the fact that\nthere is no mention of the disastrous outcome of the Second Revolt.\nIt is quite clear that she intended the Manuscript for immediate\npublication, as soon as the Iron Heel was overthrown, so that her\nhusband, so recently dead, should receive full credit for all that he\nhad ventured and accomplished. Then came the frightful crushing of the\nSecond Revolt, and it is probable that in the moment of danger, ere she\nfled or was captured by the Mercenaries, she hid the Manuscript in the\nhollow oak at Wake Robin Lodge.\n\nOf Avis Everhard there is no further record. Undoubtedly she was\nexecuted by the Mercenaries; and, as is well known, no record of such\nexecutions was kept by the Iron Heel. But little did she realize, even\nthen, as she hid the Manuscript and prepared to flee, how terrible had\nbeen the breakdown of the Second Revolt. Little did she realize that\nthe tortuous and distorted evolution of the next three centuries would\ncompel a Third Revolt and a Fourth Revolt, and many Revolts, all drowned\nin seas of blood, ere the world-movement of labor should come into its\nown. And little did she dream that for seven long centuries the tribute\nof her love to Ernest Everhard would repose undisturbed in the heart of\nthe ancient oak of Wake Robin Lodge.\n\nANTHONY MEREDITH\n\nArdis,\n\nNovember 27, 419 B.O.M.\n\n\n\n\nTHE IRON HEEL\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nMY EAGLE\n\n\nThe soft summer wind stirs the redwoods, and Wild-Water ripples sweet\ncadences over its mossy stones. There are butterflies in the sunshine,\nand from everywhere arises the drowsy hum of bees. It is so quiet and\npeaceful, and I sit here, and ponder, and am restless. It is the quiet\nthat makes me restless. It seems unreal. All the world is quiet, but it\nis the quiet before the storm. I strain my ears, and all my senses, for\nsome betrayal of that impending storm. Oh, that it may not be premature!\nThat it may not be premature!*\n\n     * The Second Revolt was largely the work of Ernest Everhard,\n     though he cooperated, of course, with the European leaders.\n     The capture and secret execution of Everhard was the great\n     event of the spring of 1932 A.D.  Yet so thoroughly had he\n     prepared for the revolt, that his fellow-conspirators were\n     able, with little confusion or delay, to carry out his\n     plans.  It was after Everhard's execution that his wife went\n     to Wake Robin Lodge, a small bungalow in the Sonoma Hills of\n     California.\n\nSmall wonder that I am restless. I think, and think, and I cannot\ncease from thinking. I have been in the thick of life so long that I\nam oppressed by the peace and quiet, and I cannot forbear from dwelling\nupon that mad maelstrom of death and destruction so soon to burst forth.\nIn my ears are the cries of the stricken; and I can see, as I have\nseen in the past,* all the marring and mangling of the sweet, beautiful\nflesh, and the souls torn with violence from proud bodies and hurled to\nGod. Thus do we poor humans attain our ends, striving through carnage\nand destruction to bring lasting peace and happiness upon the earth.\n\n     * Without doubt she here refers to the Chicago Commune.\n\nAnd then I am lonely. When I do not think of what is to come, I think of\nwhat has been and is no more--my Eagle, beating with tireless wings the\nvoid, soaring toward what was ever his sun, the flaming ideal of human\nfreedom. I cannot sit idly by and wait the great event that is his\nmaking, though he is not here to see. He devoted all the years of his\nmanhood to it, and for it he gave his life. It is his handiwork. He made\nit.*\n\n     * With all respect to Avis Everhard, it must be pointed out\n     that Everhard was but one of many able leaders who planned\n     the Second Revolt.  And we to-day, looking back across the\n     centuries, can safely say that even had he lived, the Second\n     Revolt would not have been less calamitous in its outcome\n     than it was.\n\nAnd so it is, in this anxious time of waiting, that I shall write of\nmy husband. There is much light that I alone of all persons living can\nthrow upon his character, and so noble a character cannot be blazoned\nforth too brightly. His was a great soul, and, when my love grows\nunselfish, my chiefest regret is that he is not here to witness\nto-morrow's dawn. We cannot fail. He has built too stoutly and too\nsurely for that. Woe to the Iron Heel! Soon shall it be thrust back from\noff prostrate humanity. When the word goes forth, the labor hosts of all\nthe world shall rise. There has been nothing like it in the history of\nthe world. The solidarity of labor is assured, and for the first time\nwill there be an international revolution wide as the world is wide.*\n\n     * The Second Revolt was truly international.  It was a\n     colossal plan--too colossal to be wrought by the genius of\n     one man alone. Labor, in all the oligarchies of the world,\n     was prepared to rise at the signal.  Germany, Italy, France,\n     and all Australasia were labor countries--socialist states.\n     They were ready to lend aid to the revolution.  Gallantly\n     they did; and it was for this reason, when the Second Revolt\n     was crushed, that they, too, were crushed by the united\n     oligarchies of the world, their socialist governments being\n     replaced by oligarchical governments.\n\nYou see, I am full of what is impending. I have lived it day and night\nutterly and for so long that it is ever present in my mind. For that\nmatter, I cannot think of my husband without thinking of it. He was the\nsoul of it, and how can I possibly separate the two in thought?\n\nAs I have said, there is much light that I alone can throw upon his\ncharacter. It is well known that he toiled hard for liberty and suffered\nsore. How hard he toiled and how greatly he suffered, I well know; for\nI have been with him during these twenty anxious years and I know his\npatience, his untiring effort, his infinite devotion to the Cause for\nwhich, only two months gone, he laid down his life.\n\nI shall try to write simply and to tell here how Ernest Everhard entered\nmy life--how I first met him, how he grew until I became a part of him,\nand the tremendous changes he wrought in my life. In this way may you\nlook at him through my eyes and learn him as I learned him--in all save\nthe things too secret and sweet for me to tell.\n\nIt was in February, 1912, that I first met him, when, as a guest of my\nfather's* at dinner, he came to our house in Berkeley. I cannot say that\nmy very first impression of him was favorable. He was one of many at\ndinner, and in the drawing-room where we gathered and waited for all\nto arrive, he made a rather incongruous appearance. It was \"preacher's\nnight,\" as my father privately called it, and Ernest was certainly out\nof place in the midst of the churchmen.\n\n     * John Cunningham, Avis Everhard's father, was a professor\n     at the State University at Berkeley, California.  His chosen\n     field was physics, and in addition he did much original\n     research and was greatly distinguished as a scientist.  His\n     chief contribution to science was his studies of the\n     electron and his monumental work on the \"Identification of\n     Matter and Energy,\" wherein he established, beyond cavil and\n     for all time, that the ultimate unit of matter and the\n     ultimate unit of force were identical.  This idea had been\n     earlier advanced, but not demonstrated, by Sir Oliver Lodge\n     and other students in the new field of radio-activity.\n\nIn the first place, his clothes did not fit him. He wore a ready-made\nsuit of dark cloth that was ill adjusted to his body. In fact, no\nready-made suit of clothes ever could fit his body. And on this night,\nas always, the cloth bulged with his muscles, while the coat between\nthe shoulders, what of the heavy shoulder-development, was a maze of\nwrinkles. His neck was the neck of a prize-fighter,* thick and strong.\nSo this was the social philosopher and ex-horseshoer my father had\ndiscovered, was my thought. And he certainly looked it with those\nbulging muscles and that bull-throat. Immediately I classified him--a\nsort of prodigy, I thought, a Blind Tom** of the working class.\n\n     * In that day it was the custom of men to compete for purses\n     of money.  They fought with their hands.  When one was\n     beaten into insensibility or killed, the survivor took the\n     money.\n\n     ** This obscure reference applies to a blind negro musician\n     who took the world by storm in the latter half of the\n     nineteenth century of the Christian Era.\n\nAnd then, when he shook hands with me! His handshake was firm and\nstrong, but he looked at me boldly with his black eyes--too boldly, I\nthought. You see, I was a creature of environment, and at that time had\nstrong class instincts. Such boldness on the part of a man of my own\nclass would have been almost unforgivable. I know that I could not avoid\ndropping my eyes, and I was quite relieved when I passed him on and\nturned to greet Bishop Morehouse--a favorite of mine, a sweet and\nserious man of middle age, Christ-like in appearance and goodness, and a\nscholar as well.\n\nBut this boldness that I took to be presumption was a vital clew to the\nnature of Ernest Everhard. He was simple, direct, afraid of nothing, and\nhe refused to waste time on conventional mannerisms. \"You pleased me,\"\nhe explained long afterward; \"and why should I not fill my eyes with\nthat which pleases me?\" I have said that he was afraid of nothing. He\nwas a natural aristocrat--and this in spite of the fact that he was in\nthe camp of the non-aristocrats. He was a superman, a blond beast\nsuch as Nietzsche* has described, and in addition he was aflame with\ndemocracy.\n\n     * Friederich Nietzsche, the mad philosopher of the\n     nineteenth century of the Christian Era, who caught wild\n     glimpses of truth, but who, before he was done, reasoned\n     himself around the great circle of human thought and off\n     into madness.\n\nIn the interest of meeting the other guests, and what of my unfavorable\nimpression, I forgot all about the working-class philosopher, though\nonce or twice at table I noticed him--especially the twinkle in his eye\nas he listened to the talk first of one minister and then of another. He\nhas humor, I thought, and I almost forgave him his clothes. But the time\nwent by, and the dinner went by, and he never opened his mouth to speak,\nwhile the ministers talked interminably about the working class and its\nrelation to the church, and what the church had done and was doing for\nit. I noticed that my father was annoyed because Ernest did not talk.\nOnce father took advantage of a lull and asked him to say something; but\nErnest shrugged his shoulders and with an \"I have nothing to say\" went\non eating salted almonds.\n\nBut father was not to be denied. After a while he said:\n\n\"We have with us a member of the working class. I am sure that he can\npresent things from a new point of view that will be interesting and\nrefreshing. I refer to Mr. Everhard.\"\n\nThe others betrayed a well-mannered interest, and urged Ernest for\na statement of his views. Their attitude toward him was so broadly\ntolerant and kindly that it was really patronizing. And I saw that\nErnest noted it and was amused. He looked slowly about him, and I saw\nthe glint of laughter in his eyes.\n\n\"I am not versed in the courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy,\" he\nbegan, and then hesitated with modesty and indecision.\n\n\"Go on,\" they urged, and Dr. Hammerfield said: \"We do not mind the truth\nthat is in any man. If it is sincere,\" he amended.\n\n\"Then you separate sincerity from truth?\" Ernest laughed quickly.\n\nDr. Hammerfield gasped, and managed to answer, \"The best of us may be\nmistaken, young man, the best of us.\"\n\nErnest's manner changed on the instant. He became another man.\n\n\"All right, then,\" he answered; \"and let me begin by saying that you\nare all mistaken. You know nothing, and worse than nothing, about the\nworking class. Your sociology is as vicious and worthless as is your\nmethod of thinking.\"\n\nIt was not so much what he said as how he said it. I roused at the first\nsound of his voice. It was as bold as his eyes. It was a clarion-call\nthat thrilled me. And the whole table was aroused, shaken alive from\nmonotony and drowsiness.\n\n\"What is so dreadfully vicious and worthless in our method of thinking,\nyoung man?\" Dr. Hammerfield demanded, and already there was something\nunpleasant in his voice and manner of utterance.\n\n\"You are metaphysicians. You can prove anything by metaphysics; and\nhaving done so, every metaphysician can prove every other metaphysician\nwrong--to his own satisfaction. You are anarchists in the realm of\nthought. And you are mad cosmos-makers. Each of you dwells in a cosmos\nof his own making, created out of his own fancies and desires. You do\nnot know the real world in which you live, and your thinking has no\nplace in the real world except in so far as it is phenomena of mental\naberration.\n\n\"Do you know what I was reminded of as I sat at table and listened to\nyou talk and talk? You reminded me for all the world of the scholastics\nof the Middle Ages who gravely and learnedly debated the absorbing\nquestion of how many angels could dance on the point of a needle.\nWhy, my dear sirs, you are as remote from the intellectual life of the\ntwentieth century as an Indian medicine-man making incantation in the\nprimeval forest ten thousand years ago.\"\n\nAs Ernest talked he seemed in a fine passion; his face glowed, his\neyes snapped and flashed, and his chin and jaw were eloquent with\naggressiveness. But it was only a way he had. It always aroused people.\nHis smashing, sledge-hammer manner of attack invariably made them forget\nthemselves. And they were forgetting themselves now. Bishop Morehouse\nwas leaning forward and listening intently. Exasperation and anger were\nflushing the face of Dr. Hammerfield. And others were exasperated, too,\nand some were smiling in an amused and superior way. As for myself, I\nfound it most enjoyable. I glanced at father, and I was afraid he was\ngoing to giggle at the effect of this human bombshell he had been guilty\nof launching amongst us.\n\n\"Your terms are rather vague,\" Dr. Hammerfield interrupted. \"Just\nprecisely what do you mean when you call us metaphysicians?\"\n\n\"I call you metaphysicians because you reason metaphysically,\" Ernest\nwent on. \"Your method of reasoning is the opposite to that of science.\nThere is no validity to your conclusions. You can prove everything and\nnothing, and no two of you can agree upon anything. Each of you goes\ninto his own consciousness to explain himself and the universe. As\nwell may you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps as to explain\nconsciousness by consciousness.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" Bishop Morehouse said. \"It seems to me that all\nthings of the mind are metaphysical. That most exact and convincing\nof all sciences, mathematics, is sheerly metaphysical. Each and every\nthought-process of the scientific reasoner is metaphysical. Surely you\nwill agree with me?\"\n\n\"As you say, you do not understand,\" Ernest replied. \"The metaphysician\nreasons deductively out of his own subjectivity. The scientist reasons\ninductively from the facts of experience. The metaphysician reasons\nfrom theory to facts, the scientist reasons from facts to theory. The\nmetaphysician explains the universe by himself, the scientist explains\nhimself by the universe.\"\n\n\"Thank God we are not scientists,\" Dr. Hammerfield murmured\ncomplacently.\n\n\"What are you then?\" Ernest demanded.\n\n\"Philosophers.\"\n\n\"There you go,\" Ernest laughed. \"You have left the real and solid earth\nand are up in the air with a word for a flying machine. Pray come down\nto earth and tell me precisely what you do mean by philosophy.\"\n\n\"Philosophy is--\" (Dr. Hammerfield paused and cleared his\nthroat)--\"something that cannot be defined comprehensively except to\nsuch minds and temperaments as are philosophical. The narrow scientist\nwith his nose in a test-tube cannot understand philosophy.\"\n\nErnest ignored the thrust. It was always his way to turn the point back\nupon an opponent, and he did it now, with a beaming brotherliness of\nface and utterance.\n\n\"Then you will undoubtedly understand the definition I shall now make\nof philosophy. But before I make it, I shall challenge you to point out\nerror in it or to remain a silent metaphysician. Philosophy is merely\nthe widest science of all. Its reasoning method is the same as that of\nany particular science and of all particular sciences. And by that\nsame method of reasoning, the inductive method, philosophy fuses all\nparticular sciences into one great science. As Spencer says, the data\nof any particular science are partially unified knowledge. Philosophy\nunifies the knowledge that is contributed by all the sciences.\nPhilosophy is the science of science, the master science, if you please.\nHow do you like my definition?\"\n\n\"Very creditable, very creditable,\" Dr. Hammerfield muttered lamely.\n\nBut Ernest was merciless.\n\n\"Remember,\" he warned, \"my definition is fatal to metaphysics. If you do\nnot now point out a flaw in my definition, you are disqualified later on\nfrom advancing metaphysical arguments. You must go through life seeking\nthat flaw and remaining metaphysically silent until you have found it.\"\n\nErnest waited. The silence was painful. Dr. Hammerfield was pained. He\nwas also puzzled. Ernest's sledge-hammer attack disconcerted him. He\nwas not used to the simple and direct method of controversy. He looked\nappealingly around the table, but no one answered for him. I caught\nfather grinning into his napkin.\n\n\"There is another way of disqualifying the metaphysicians,\" Ernest said,\nwhen he had rendered Dr. Hammerfield's discomfiture complete. \"Judge\nthem by their works. What have they done for mankind beyond the spinning\nof airy fancies and the mistaking of their own shadows for gods? They\nhave added to the gayety of mankind, I grant; but what tangible good\nhave they wrought for mankind? They philosophized, if you will pardon my\nmisuse of the word, about the heart as the seat of the emotions, while\nthe scientists were formulating the circulation of the blood. They\ndeclaimed about famine and pestilence as being scourges of God, while\nthe scientists were building granaries and draining cities. They\nbuilded gods in their own shapes and out of their own desires, while\nthe scientists were building roads and bridges. They were describing\nthe earth as the centre of the universe, while the scientists were\ndiscovering America and probing space for the stars and the laws of\nthe stars. In short, the metaphysicians have done nothing, absolutely\nnothing, for mankind. Step by step, before the advance of science, they\nhave been driven back. As fast as the ascertained facts of science have\noverthrown their subjective explanations of things, they have made new\nsubjective explanations of things, including explanations of the latest\nascertained facts. And this, I doubt not, they will go on doing to\nthe end of time. Gentlemen, a metaphysician is a medicine man.\nThe difference between you and the Eskimo who makes a fur-clad\nblubber-eating god is merely a difference of several thousand years of\nascertained facts. That is all.\"\n\n\"Yet the thought of Aristotle ruled Europe for twelve centuries,\" Dr.\nBallingford announced pompously. \"And Aristotle was a metaphysician.\"\n\nDr. Ballingford glanced around the table and was rewarded by nods and\nsmiles of approval.\n\n\"Your illustration is most unfortunate,\" Ernest replied. \"You refer to a\nvery dark period in human history. In fact, we call that period the Dark\nAges. A period wherein science was raped by the metaphysicians, wherein\nphysics became a search for the Philosopher's Stone, wherein chemistry\nbecame alchemy, and astronomy became astrology. Sorry the domination of\nAristotle's thought!\"\n\nDr. Ballingford looked pained, then he brightened up and said:\n\n\"Granted this horrible picture you have drawn, yet you must confess that\nmetaphysics was inherently potent in so far as it drew humanity out\nof this dark period and on into the illumination of the succeeding\ncenturies.\"\n\n\"Metaphysics had nothing to do with it,\" Ernest retorted.\n\n\"What?\" Dr. Hammerfield cried. \"It was not the thinking and the\nspeculation that led to the voyages of discovery?\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear sir,\" Ernest smiled, \"I thought you were disqualified. You\nhave not yet picked out the flaw in my definition of philosophy. You are\nnow on an unsubstantial basis. But it is the way of the metaphysicians,\nand I forgive you. No, I repeat, metaphysics had nothing to do with\nit. Bread and butter, silks and jewels, dollars and cents, and,\nincidentally, the closing up of the overland trade-routes to India,\nwere the things that caused the voyages of discovery. With the fall of\nConstantinople, in 1453, the Turks blocked the way of the caravans to\nIndia. The traders of Europe had to find another route. Here was the\noriginal cause for the voyages of discovery. Columbus sailed to find\na new route to the Indies. It is so stated in all the history books.\nIncidentally, new facts were learned about the nature, size, and form of\nthe earth, and the Ptolemaic system went glimmering.\"\n\nDr. Hammerfield snorted.\n\n\"You do not agree with me?\" Ernest queried. \"Then wherein am I wrong?\"\n\n\"I can only reaffirm my position,\" Dr. Hammerfield retorted tartly. \"It\nis too long a story to enter into now.\"\n\n\"No story is too long for the scientist,\" Ernest said sweetly. \"That is\nwhy the scientist gets to places. That is why he got to America.\"\n\nI shall not describe the whole evening, though it is a joy to me to\nrecall every moment, every detail, of those first hours of my coming to\nknow Ernest Everhard.\n\nBattle royal raged, and the ministers grew red-faced and excited,\nespecially at the moments when Ernest called them romantic philosophers,\nshadow-projectors, and similar things. And always he checked them back\nto facts. \"The fact, man, the irrefragable fact!\" he would proclaim\ntriumphantly, when he had brought one of them a cropper. He bristled\nwith facts. He tripped them up with facts, ambuscaded them with facts,\nbombarded them with broadsides of facts.\n\n\"You seem to worship at the shrine of fact,\" Dr. Hammerfield taunted\nhim.\n\n\"There is no God but Fact, and Mr. Everhard is its prophet,\" Dr.\nBallingford paraphrased.\n\nErnest smilingly acquiesced.\n\n\"I'm like the man from Texas,\" he said. And, on being solicited, he\nexplained. \"You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got\nto show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my\nhand.' From which it is apparent that he is no metaphysician.\"\n\nAnother time, when Ernest had just said that the metaphysical\nphilosophers could never stand the test of truth, Dr. Hammerfield\nsuddenly demanded:\n\n\"What is the test of truth, young man? Will you kindly explain what has\nso long puzzled wiser heads than yours?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Ernest answered. His cocksureness irritated them. \"The wise\nheads have puzzled so sorely over truth because they went up into the\nair after it. Had they remained on the solid earth, they would have\nfound it easily enough--ay, they would have found that they themselves\nwere precisely testing truth with every practical act and thought of\ntheir lives.\"\n\n\"The test, the test,\" Dr. Hammerfield repeated impatiently. \"Never mind\nthe preamble. Give us that which we have sought so long--the test of\ntruth. Give it us, and we will be as gods.\"\n\nThere was an impolite and sneering scepticism in his words and manner\nthat secretly pleased most of them at the table, though it seemed to\nbother Bishop Morehouse.\n\n\"Dr. Jordan* has stated it very clearly,\" Ernest said. \"His test of\ntruth is: 'Will it work? Will you trust your life to it?'\"\n\n     * A noted educator of the late nineteenth and early\n     twentieth centuries of the Christian Era.  He was president\n     of the Stanford University, a private benefaction of the\n     times.\n\n\"Pish!\" Dr. Hammerfield sneered. \"You have not taken Bishop Berkeley*\ninto account. He has never been answered.\"\n\n     * An idealistic monist who long puzzled the philosophers of\n     that time with his denial of the existence of matter, but\n     whose clever argument was finally demolished when the new\n     empiric facts of science were philosophically generalized.\n\n\"The noblest metaphysician of them all,\" Ernest laughed. \"But your\nexample is unfortunate. As Berkeley himself attested, his metaphysics\ndidn't work.\"\n\nDr. Hammerfield was angry, righteously angry. It was as though he had\ncaught Ernest in a theft or a lie.\n\n\"Young man,\" he trumpeted, \"that statement is on a par with all you have\nuttered to-night. It is a base and unwarranted assumption.\"\n\n\"I am quite crushed,\" Ernest murmured meekly. \"Only I don't know what\nhit me. You'll have to put it in my hand, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I will, I will,\" Dr. Hammerfield spluttered. \"How do you know? You\ndo not know that Bishop Berkeley attested that his metaphysics did not\nwork. You have no proof. Young man, they have always worked.\"\n\n\"I take it as proof that Berkeley's metaphysics did not work, because--\"\nErnest paused calmly for a moment. \"Because Berkeley made an invariable\npractice of going through doors instead of walls. Because he trusted his\nlife to solid bread and butter and roast beef. Because he shaved himself\nwith a razor that worked when it removed the hair from his face.\"\n\n\"But those are actual things!\" Dr. Hammerfield cried. \"Metaphysics is of\nthe mind.\"\n\n\"And they work--in the mind?\" Ernest queried softly.\n\nThe other nodded.\n\n\"And even a multitude of angels can dance on the point of a needle--in\nthe mind,\" Ernest went on reflectively. \"And a blubber-eating, fur-clad\ngod can exist and work--in the mind; and there are no proofs to the\ncontrary--in the mind. I suppose, Doctor, you live in the mind?\"\n\n\"My mind to me a kingdom is,\" was the answer.\n\n\"That's another way of saying that you live up in the air. But you come\nback to earth at meal-time, I am sure, or when an earthquake happens\nalong. Or, tell me, Doctor, do you have no apprehension in an earthquake\nthat that incorporeal body of yours will be hit by an immaterial brick?\"\n\nInstantly, and quite unconsciously, Dr. Hammerfield's hand shot up to\nhis head, where a scar disappeared under the hair. It happened that\nErnest had blundered on an apposite illustration. Dr. Hammerfield\nhad been nearly killed in the Great Earthquake* by a falling chimney.\nEverybody broke out into roars of laughter.\n\n     * The Great Earthquake of 1906 A.D. that destroyed San\n     Francisco.\n\n\"Well?\" Ernest asked, when the merriment had subsided. \"Proofs to the\ncontrary?\"\n\nAnd in the silence he asked again, \"Well?\" Then he added, \"Still well,\nbut not so well, that argument of yours.\"\n\nBut Dr. Hammerfield was temporarily crushed, and the battle raged on in\nnew directions. On point after point, Ernest challenged the ministers.\nWhen they affirmed that they knew the working class, he told them\nfundamental truths about the working class that they did not know, and\nchallenged them for disproofs. He gave them facts, always facts, checked\ntheir excursions into the air, and brought them back to the solid earth\nand its facts.\n\nHow the scene comes back to me! I can hear him now, with that war-note\nin his voice, flaying them with his facts, each fact a lash that stung\nand stung again. And he was merciless. He took no quarter,* and gave\nnone. I can never forget the flaying he gave them at the end:\n\n     * This figure arises from the customs of the times.  When,\n     among men fighting to the death in their wild-animal way, a\n     beaten man threw down his weapons, it was at the option of\n     the victor to slay him or spare him.\n\n\"You have repeatedly confessed to-night, by direct avowal or ignorant\nstatement, that you do not know the working class. But you are not to be\nblamed for this. How can you know anything about the working class? You\ndo not live in the same locality with the working class. You herd\nwith the capitalist class in another locality. And why not? It is the\ncapitalist class that pays you, that feeds you, that puts the very\nclothes on your backs that you are wearing to-night. And in return you\npreach to your employers the brands of metaphysics that are especially\nacceptable to them; and the especially acceptable brands are acceptable\nbecause they do not menace the established order of society.\"\n\nHere there was a stir of dissent around the table.\n\n\"Oh, I am not challenging your sincerity,\" Ernest continued. \"You are\nsincere. You preach what you believe. There lies your strength and your\nvalue--to the capitalist class. But should you change your belief to\nsomething that menaces the established order, your preaching would\nbe unacceptable to your employers, and you would be discharged. Every\nlittle while some one or another of you is so discharged.* Am I not\nright?\"\n\n     * During this period there were many ministers cast out of\n     the church for preaching unacceptable doctrine.  Especially\n     were they cast out when their preaching became tainted with\n     socialism.\n\nThis time there was no dissent. They sat dumbly acquiescent, with the\nexception of Dr. Hammerfield, who said:\n\n\"It is when their thinking is wrong that they are asked to resign.\"\n\n\"Which is another way of saying when their thinking is unacceptable,\"\nErnest answered, and then went on. \"So I say to you, go ahead and preach\nand earn your pay, but for goodness' sake leave the working class alone.\nYou belong in the enemy's camp. You have nothing in common with the\nworking class. Your hands are soft with the work others have performed\nfor you. Your stomachs are round with the plenitude of eating.\" (Here\nDr. Ballingford winced, and every eye glanced at his prodigious girth.\nIt was said he had not seen his own feet in years.) \"And your minds are\nfilled with doctrines that are buttresses of the established order. You\nare as much mercenaries (sincere mercenaries, I grant) as were the men\nof the Swiss Guard.* Be true to your salt and your hire; guard, with\nyour preaching, the interests of your employers; but do not come down to\nthe working class and serve as false leaders. You cannot honestly be in\nthe two camps at once. The working class has done without you. Believe\nme, the working class will continue to do without you. And, furthermore,\nthe working class can do better without you than with you.\"\n\n     * The hired foreign palace guards of Louis XVI, a king of\n     France that was beheaded by his people.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nCHALLENGES.\n\n\nAfter the guests had gone, father threw himself into a chair and gave\nvent to roars of Gargantuan laughter. Not since the death of my mother\nhad I known him to laugh so heartily.\n\n\"I'll wager Dr. Hammerfield was never up against anything like it in his\nlife,\" he laughed. \"'The courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy!' Did\nyou notice how he began like a lamb--Everhard, I mean, and how quickly\nhe became a roaring lion? He has a splendidly disciplined mind. He would\nhave made a good scientist if his energies had been directed that way.\"\n\nI need scarcely say that I was deeply interested in Ernest Everhard. It\nwas not alone what he had said and how he had said it, but it was the\nman himself. I had never met a man like him. I suppose that was why, in\nspite of my twenty-four years, I had not married. I liked him; I had to\nconfess it to myself. And my like for him was founded on things\nbeyond intellect and argument. Regardless of his bulging muscles and\nprize-fighter's throat, he impressed me as an ingenuous boy. I felt\nthat under the guise of an intellectual swashbuckler was a delicate and\nsensitive spirit. I sensed this, in ways I knew not, save that they were\nmy woman's intuitions.\n\nThere was something in that clarion-call of his that went to my heart.\nIt still rang in my ears, and I felt that I should like to hear it\nagain--and to see again that glint of laughter in his eyes that belied\nthe impassioned seriousness of his face. And there were further reaches\nof vague and indeterminate feelings that stirred in me. I almost loved\nhim then, though I am confident, had I never seen him again, that the\nvague feelings would have passed away and that I should easily have\nforgotten him.\n\nBut I was not destined never to see him again. My father's new-born\ninterest in sociology and the dinner parties he gave would not permit.\nFather was not a sociologist. His marriage with my mother had been very\nhappy, and in the researches of his own science, physics, he had been\nvery happy. But when mother died, his own work could not fill the\nemptiness. At first, in a mild way, he had dabbled in philosophy; then,\nbecoming interested, he had drifted on into economics and sociology. He\nhad a strong sense of justice, and he soon became fired with a passion\nto redress wrong. It was with gratitude that I hailed these signs of a\nnew interest in life, though I little dreamed what the outcome would\nbe. With the enthusiasm of a boy he plunged excitedly into these new\npursuits, regardless of whither they led him.\n\nHe had been used always to the laboratory, and so it was that he turned\nthe dining room into a sociological laboratory. Here came to dinner\nall sorts and conditions of men,--scientists, politicians, bankers,\nmerchants, professors, labor leaders, socialists, and anarchists. He\nstirred them to discussion, and analyzed their thoughts of life and\nsociety.\n\nHe had met Ernest shortly prior to the \"preacher's night.\" And after the\nguests were gone, I learned how he had met him, passing down a street at\nnight and stopping to listen to a man on a soap-box who was addressing\na crowd of workingmen. The man on the box was Ernest. Not that he was\na mere soap-box orator. He stood high in the councils of the socialist\nparty, was one of the leaders, and was the acknowledged leader in the\nphilosophy of socialism. But he had a certain clear way of stating the\nabstruse in simple language, was a born expositor and teacher, and\nwas not above the soap-box as a means of interpreting economics to the\nworkingmen.\n\nMy father stopped to listen, became interested, effected a meeting, and,\nafter quite an acquaintance, invited him to the ministers' dinner. It\nwas after the dinner that father told me what little he knew about him.\nHe had been born in the working class, though he was a descendant of\nthe old line of Everhards that for over two hundred years had lived\nin America.* At ten years of age he had gone to work in the mills,\nand later he served his apprenticeship and became a horseshoer. He was\nself-educated, had taught himself German and French, and at that time\nwas earning a meagre living by translating scientific and philosophical\nworks for a struggling socialist publishing house in Chicago. Also, his\nearnings were added to by the royalties from the small sales of his own\neconomic and philosophic works.\n\n     * The distinction between being native born and foreign born\n     was sharp and invidious in those days.\n\nThis much I learned of him before I went to bed, and I lay long awake,\nlistening in memory to the sound of his voice. I grew frightened at\nmy thoughts. He was so unlike the men of my own class, so alien and so\nstrong. His masterfulness delighted me and terrified me, for my fancies\nwantonly roved until I found myself considering him as a lover, as a\nhusband. I had always heard that the strength of men was an irresistible\nattraction to women; but he was too strong. \"No! no!\" I cried out. \"It\nis impossible, absurd!\" And on the morrow I awoke to find in myself\na longing to see him again. I wanted to see him mastering men in\ndiscussion, the war-note in his voice; to see him, in all his certitude\nand strength, shattering their complacency, shaking them out of their\nruts of thinking. What if he did swashbuckle? To use his own phrase, \"it\nworked,\" it produced effects. And, besides, his swashbuckling was a fine\nthing to see. It stirred one like the onset of battle.\n\nSeveral days passed during which I read Ernest's books, borrowed from my\nfather. His written word was as his spoken word, clear and convincing.\nIt was its absolute simplicity that convinced even while one continued\nto doubt. He had the gift of lucidity. He was the perfect expositor.\nYet, in spite of his style, there was much that I did not like. He laid\ntoo great stress on what he called the class struggle, the antagonism\nbetween labor and capital, the conflict of interest.\n\nFather reported with glee Dr. Hammerfield's judgment of Ernest, which\nwas to the effect that he was \"an insolent young puppy, made bumptious\nby a little and very inadequate learning.\" Also, Dr. Hammerfield\ndeclined to meet Ernest again.\n\nBut Bishop Morehouse turned out to have become interested in Ernest,\nand was anxious for another meeting. \"A strong young man,\" he said; \"and\nvery much alive, very much alive. But he is too sure, too sure.\"\n\nErnest came one afternoon with father. The Bishop had already arrived,\nand we were having tea on the veranda. Ernest's continued presence in\nBerkeley, by the way, was accounted for by the fact that he was taking\nspecial courses in biology at the university, and also that he was hard\nat work on a new book entitled \"Philosophy and Revolution.\"*\n\n     * This book continued to be secretly printed throughout the\n     three centuries of the Iron Heel.  There are several copies\n     of various editions in the National Library of Ardis.\n\nThe veranda seemed suddenly to have become small when Ernest arrived.\nNot that he was so very large--he stood only five feet nine inches; but\nthat he seemed to radiate an atmosphere of largeness. As he stopped to\nmeet me, he betrayed a certain slight awkwardness that was strangely at\nvariance with his bold-looking eyes and his firm, sure hand that clasped\nfor a moment in greeting. And in that moment his eyes were just as\nsteady and sure. There seemed a question in them this time, and as\nbefore he looked at me over long.\n\n\"I have been reading your 'Working-class Philosophy,'\" I said, and his\neyes lighted in a pleased way.\n\n\"Of course,\" he answered, \"you took into consideration the audience to\nwhich it was addressed.\"\n\n\"I did, and it is because I did that I have a quarrel with you,\" I\nchallenged.\n\n\"I, too, have a quarrel with you, Mr. Everhard,\" Bishop Morehouse said.\n\nErnest shrugged his shoulders whimsically and accepted a cup of tea.\n\nThe Bishop bowed and gave me precedence.\n\n\"You foment class hatred,\" I said. \"I consider it wrong and criminal\nto appeal to all that is narrow and brutal in the working class. Class\nhatred is anti-social, and, it seems to me, anti-socialistic.\"\n\n\"Not guilty,\" he answered. \"Class hatred is neither in the text nor in\nthe spirit of anything I have ever written.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I cried reproachfully, and reached for his book and opened it.\n\nHe sipped his tea and smiled at me while I ran over the pages.\n\n\"Page one hundred and thirty-two,\" I read aloud: \"'The class struggle,\ntherefore, presents itself in the present stage of social development\nbetween the wage-paying and the wage-paid classes.'\"\n\nI looked at him triumphantly.\n\n\"No mention there of class hatred,\" he smiled back.\n\n\"But,\" I answered, \"you say 'class struggle.'\"\n\n\"A different thing from class hatred,\" he replied. \"And, believe me,\nwe foment no hatred. We say that the class struggle is a law of social\ndevelopment. We are not responsible for it. We do not make the class\nstruggle. We merely explain it, as Newton explained gravitation. We\nexplain the nature of the conflict of interest that produces the class\nstruggle.\"\n\n\"But there should be no conflict of interest!\" I cried.\n\n\"I agree with you heartily,\" he answered. \"That is what we socialists\nare trying to bring about,--the abolition of the conflict of interest.\nPardon me. Let me read an extract.\" He took his book and turned back\nseveral pages. \"Page one hundred and twenty-six: 'The cycle of class\nstruggles which began with the dissolution of rude, tribal communism\nand the rise of private property will end with the passing of private\nproperty in the means of social existence.'\"\n\n\"But I disagree with you,\" the Bishop interposed, his pale, ascetic face\nbetraying by a faint glow the intensity of his feelings. \"Your premise\nis wrong. There is no such thing as a conflict of interest between labor\nand capital--or, rather, there ought not to be.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Ernest said gravely. \"By that last statement you have given\nme back my premise.\"\n\n\"But why should there be a conflict?\" the Bishop demanded warmly.\n\nErnest shrugged his shoulders. \"Because we are so made, I guess.\"\n\n\"But we are not so made!\" cried the other.\n\n\"Are you discussing the ideal man?\" Ernest asked, \"--unselfish and\ngodlike, and so few in numbers as to be practically non-existent, or are\nyou discussing the common and ordinary average man?\"\n\n\"The common and ordinary man,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Who is weak and fallible, prone to error?\"\n\nBishop Morehouse nodded.\n\n\"And petty and selfish?\"\n\nAgain he nodded.\n\n\"Watch out!\" Ernest warned. \"I said 'selfish.'\"\n\n\"The average man IS selfish,\" the Bishop affirmed valiantly.\n\n\"Wants all he can get?\"\n\n\"Wants all he can get--true but deplorable.\"\n\n\"Then I've got you.\" Ernest's jaw snapped like a trap. \"Let me show you.\nHere is a man who works on the street railways.\"\n\n\"He couldn't work if it weren't for capital,\" the Bishop interrupted.\n\n\"True, and you will grant that capital would perish if there were no\nlabor to earn the dividends.\"\n\nThe Bishop was silent.\n\n\"Won't you?\" Ernest insisted.\n\nThe Bishop nodded.\n\n\"Then our statements cancel each other,\" Ernest said in a matter-of-fact\ntone, \"and we are where we were. Now to begin again. The workingmen\non the street railway furnish the labor. The stockholders furnish the\ncapital. By the joint effort of the workingmen and the capital, money is\nearned.* They divide between them this money that is earned. Capital's\nshare is called 'dividends.' Labor's share is called 'wages.'\"\n\n     * In those days, groups of predatory individuals controlled\n     all the means of transportation, and for the use of same\n     levied toll upon the public.\n\n\"Very good,\" the Bishop interposed. \"And there is no reason that the\ndivision should not be amicable.\"\n\n\"You have already forgotten what we had agreed upon,\" Ernest replied.\n\"We agreed that the average man is selfish. He is the man that is. You\nhave gone up in the air and are arranging a division between the kind\nof men that ought to be but are not. But to return to the earth, the\nworkingman, being selfish, wants all he can get in the division. The\ncapitalist, being selfish, wants all he can get in the division. When\nthere is only so much of the same thing, and when two men want all they\ncan get of the same thing, there is a conflict of interest between labor\nand capital. And it is an irreconcilable conflict. As long as workingmen\nand capitalists exist, they will continue to quarrel over the division.\nIf you were in San Francisco this afternoon, you'd have to walk. There\nisn't a street car running.\"\n\n\"Another strike?\"* the Bishop queried with alarm.\n\n     * These quarrels were very common in those irrational and\n     anarchic times.  Sometimes the laborers refused to work.\n     Sometimes the capitalists refused to let the laborers work.\n     In the violence and turbulence of such disagreements much\n     property was destroyed and many lives lost.  All this is\n     inconceivable to us--as inconceivable as another custom of\n     that time, namely, the habit the men of the lower classes\n     had of breaking the furniture when they quarrelled with\n     their wives.\n\n\"Yes, they're quarrelling over the division of the earnings of the\nstreet railways.\"\n\nBishop Morehouse became excited.\n\n\"It is wrong!\" he cried. \"It is so short-sighted on the part of the\nworkingmen. How can they hope to keep our sympathy--\"\n\n\"When we are compelled to walk,\" Ernest said slyly.\n\nBut Bishop Morehouse ignored him and went on:\n\n\"Their outlook is too narrow. Men should be men, not brutes. There will\nbe violence and murder now, and sorrowing widows and orphans. Capital\nand labor should be friends. They should work hand in hand and to their\nmutual benefit.\"\n\n\"Ah, now you are up in the air again,\" Ernest remarked dryly. \"Come back\nto earth. Remember, we agreed that the average man is selfish.\"\n\n\"But he ought not to be!\" the Bishop cried.\n\n\"And there I agree with you,\" was Ernest's rejoinder. \"He ought not to\nbe selfish, but he will continue to be selfish as long as he lives in a\nsocial system that is based on pig-ethics.\"\n\nThe Bishop was aghast, and my father chuckled.\n\n\"Yes, pig-ethics,\" Ernest went on remorselessly. \"That is the meaning\nof the capitalist system. And that is what your church is standing\nfor, what you are preaching for every time you get up in the pulpit.\nPig-ethics! There is no other name for it.\"\n\nBishop Morehouse turned appealingly to my father, but he laughed and\nnodded his head.\n\n\"I'm afraid Mr. Everhard is right,\" he said. \"LAISSEZ-FAIRE, the\nlet-alone policy of each for himself and devil take the hindmost. As Mr.\nEverhard said the other night, the function you churchmen perform is to\nmaintain the established order of society, and society is established on\nthat foundation.\"\n\n\"But that is not the teaching of Christ!\" cried the Bishop.\n\n\"The Church is not teaching Christ these days,\" Ernest put in quickly.\n\"That is why the workingmen will have nothing to do with the Church.\nThe Church condones the frightful brutality and savagery with which the\ncapitalist class treats the working class.\"\n\n\"The Church does not condone it,\" the Bishop objected.\n\n\"The Church does not protest against it,\" Ernest replied. \"And in so far\nas the Church does not protest, it condones, for remember the Church is\nsupported by the capitalist class.\"\n\n\"I had not looked at it in that light,\" the Bishop said naively. \"You\nmust be wrong. I know that there is much that is sad and wicked in\nthis world. I know that the Church has lost the--what you call the\nproletariat.\"*\n\n     * Proletariat: Derived originally from the Latin PROLETARII,\n     the name given in the census of Servius Tullius to those who\n     were of value to the state only as the rearers of offspring\n     (PROLES); in other words, they were of no importance either\n     for wealth, or position, or exceptional ability.\n\n\"You never had the proletariat,\" Ernest cried. \"The proletariat has\ngrown up outside the Church and without the Church.\"\n\n\"I do not follow you,\" the Bishop said faintly.\n\n\"Then let me explain. With the introduction of machinery and the factory\nsystem in the latter part of the eighteenth century, the great mass of\nthe working people was separated from the land. The old system of labor\nwas broken down. The working people were driven from their villages and\nherded in factory towns. The mothers and children were put to work at\nthe new machines. Family life ceased. The conditions were frightful. It\nis a tale of blood.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Bishop Morehouse interrupted with an agonized\nexpression on his face. \"It was terrible. But it occurred a century and\na half ago.\"\n\n\"And there, a century and a half ago, originated the modern\nproletariat,\" Ernest continued. \"And the Church ignored it. While a\nslaughter-house was made of the nation by the capitalist, the Church\nwas dumb. It did not protest, as to-day it does not protest. As Austin\nLewis* says, speaking of that time, those to whom the command 'Feed my\nlambs' had been given, saw those lambs sold into slavery and worked to\ndeath without a protest.** The Church was dumb, then, and before I go on\nI want you either flatly to agree with me or flatly to disagree with me.\nWas the Church dumb then?\"\n\n     * Candidate for Governor of California on the Socialist\n     ticket in the fall election of 1906 Christian Era.

In such industrial hells arose some of\n     the proudest fortunes of that day.\n\nBishop Morehouse hesitated. Like Dr. Hammerfield, he was unused to this\nfierce \"infighting,\" as Ernest called it.\n\n\"The history of the eighteenth century is written,\" Ernest prompted. \"If\nthe Church was not dumb, it will be found not dumb in the books.\"\n\n\"I am afraid the Church was dumb,\" the Bishop confessed.\n\n\"And the Church is dumb to-day.\"\n\n\"There I disagree,\" said the Bishop.\n\nErnest paused, looked at him searchingly, and accepted the challenge.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Let us see. In Chicago there are women who toil\nall the week for ninety cents. Has the Church protested?\"\n\n\"This is news to me,\" was the answer. \"Ninety cents per week! It is\nhorrible!\"\n\n\"Has the Church protested?\" Ernest insisted.\n\n\"The Church does not know.\" The Bishop was struggling hard.\n\n\"Yet the command to the Church was, 'Feed my lambs,'\" Ernest sneered.\nAnd then, the next moment, \"Pardon my sneer, Bishop. But can you\nwonder that we lose patience with you? When have you protested to your\ncapitalistic congregations at the working of children in the Southern\ncotton mills?* Children, six and seven years of age, working every night\nat twelve-hour shifts? They never see the blessed sunshine. They die\nlike flies. The dividends are paid out of their blood. And out of the\ndividends magnificent churches are builded in New England, wherein your\nkind preaches pleasant platitudes to the sleek, full-bellied recipients\nof those dividends.\"\n\n     * Everhard might have drawn a better illustration from the\n     Southern Church's outspoken defence of chattel slavery prior\n     to what is known as the \"War of the Rebellion.\"  Several\n     such illustrations, culled from the documents of the times,\n     are here appended.  In 1835 A.D., the General Assembly of\n     the Presbyterian Church resolved that: \"slavery is\n     recognized in both the Old and the New Testaments, and is\n     not condemned by the authority of God.\"  The Charleston\n     Baptist Association issued the following, in an address, in\n     1835 A.D.: \"The right of masters to dispose of the time of\n     their slaves has been distinctly recognized by the Creator\n     of all things, who is surely at liberty to vest the right of\n     property over any object whomsoever He pleases.\"  The Rev.\n     E. D. Simon, Doctor of Divinity and professor in the\n     Randolph-Macon Methodist College of Virginia, wrote:\n     \"Extracts from Holy Writ unequivocally assert the right of\n     property in slaves, together with the usual incidents to\n     that right.  The right to buy and sell is clearly stated.\n     Upon the whole, then, whether we consult the Jewish policy\n     instituted by God himself, or the uniform opinion and\n     practice of mankind in all ages, or the injunctions of the\n     New Testament and the moral law, we are brought to the\n     conclusion that slavery is not immoral.  Having established\n     the point that the first African slaves were legally brought\n     into bondage, the right to detain their children in bondage\n     follows as an indispensable consequence.  Thus we see that\n     the slavery that exists in America was founded in right.\"\n\n     It is not at all remarkable that this same note should have\n     been struck by the Church a generation or so later in\n     relation to the defence of capitalistic property.  In the\n     great museum at Asgard there is a book entitled \"Essays in\n     Application,\" written by Henry van Dyke.  The book was\n     published in 1905 of the Christian Era. From what we can\n     make out, Van Dyke must have been a churchman. The book is a\n     good example of what Everhard would have called bourgeois\n     thinking.  Note the similarity between the utterance of the\n     Charleston Baptist Association quoted above, and the\n     following utterance of Van Dyke seventy years later: \"The\n     Bible teaches that God owns the world.  He distributes to\n     every man according to His own good pleasure, conformably to\n     general laws.\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" the Bishop murmured faintly. His face was pale, and he\nseemed suffering from nausea.\n\n\"Then you have not protested?\"\n\nThe Bishop shook his head.\n\n\"Then the Church is dumb to-day, as it was in the eighteenth century?\"\n\nThe Bishop was silent, and for once Ernest forbore to press the point.\n\n\"And do not forget, whenever a churchman does protest, that he is\ndischarged.\"\n\n\"I hardly think that is fair,\" was the objection.\n\n\"Will you protest?\" Ernest demanded.\n\n\"Show me evils, such as you mention, in our own community, and I will\nprotest.\"\n\n\"I'll show you,\" Ernest said quietly. \"I am at your disposal. I will\ntake you on a journey through hell.\"\n\n\"And I shall protest.\" The Bishop straightened himself in his chair, and\nover his gentle face spread the harshness of the warrior. \"The Church\nshall not be dumb!\"\n\n\"You will be discharged,\" was the warning.\n\n\"I shall prove the contrary,\" was the retort. \"I shall prove, if\nwhat you say is so, that the Church has erred through ignorance. And,\nfurthermore, I hold that whatever is horrible in industrial society is\ndue to the ignorance of the capitalist class. It will mend all that is\nwrong as soon as it receives the message. And this message it shall be\nthe duty of the Church to deliver.\"\n\nErnest laughed. He laughed brutally, and I was driven to the Bishop's\ndefence.\n\n\"Remember,\" I said, \"you see but one side of the shield. There is\nmuch good in us, though you give us credit for no good at all. Bishop\nMorehouse is right. The industrial wrong, terrible as you say it is,\nis due to ignorance. The divisions of society have become too widely\nseparated.\"\n\n\"The wild Indian is not so brutal and savage as the capitalist class,\"\nhe answered; and in that moment I hated him.\n\n\"You do not know us,\" I answered. \"We are not brutal and savage.\"\n\n\"Prove it,\" he challenged.\n\n\"How can I prove it . . . to you?\" I was growing angry.\n\nHe shook his head. \"I do not ask you to prove it to me. I ask you to\nprove it to yourself.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said.\n\n\"You know nothing,\" was his rude reply.\n\n\"There, there, children,\" father said soothingly.\n\n\"I don't care--\" I began indignantly, but Ernest interrupted.\n\n\"I understand you have money, or your father has, which is the same\nthing--money invested in the Sierra Mills.\"\n\n\"What has that to do with it?\" I cried.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" he began slowly, \"except that the gown you wear is\nstained with blood. The food you eat is a bloody stew. The blood of\nlittle children and of strong men is dripping from your very roof-beams.\nI can close my eyes, now, and hear it drip, drop, drip, drop, all about\nme.\"\n\nAnd suiting the action to the words, he closed his eyes and leaned back\nin his chair. I burst into tears of mortification and hurt vanity. I had\nnever been so brutally treated in my life. Both the Bishop and my father\nwere embarrassed and perturbed. They tried to lead the conversation\naway into easier channels; but Ernest opened his eyes, looked at me,\nand waved them aside. His mouth was stern, and his eyes too; and in the\nlatter there was no glint of laughter. What he was about to say, what\nterrible castigation he was going to give me, I never knew; for at that\nmoment a man, passing along the sidewalk, stopped and glanced in at us.\nHe was a large man, poorly dressed, and on his back was a great load of\nrattan and bamboo stands, chairs, and screens. He looked at the house as\nif debating whether or not he should come in and try to sell some of his\nwares.\n\n\"That man's name is Jackson,\" Ernest said.\n\n\"With that strong body of his he should be at work, and not peddling,\"*\nI answered curtly.\n\n     * In that day there were many thousands of these poor\n     merchants called PEDLERS.  They carried their whole stock in\n     trade from door to door.  It was a most wasteful expenditure\n     of energy. Distribution was as confused and irrational as\n     the whole general system of society.\n\n\"Notice the sleeve of his left arm,\" Ernest said gently.\n\nI looked, and saw that the sleeve was empty.\n\n\"It was some of the blood from that arm that I heard dripping from your\nroof-beams,\" Ernest said with continued gentleness. \"He lost his arm in\nthe Sierra Mills, and like a broken-down horse you turned him out on\nthe highway to die. When I say 'you,' I mean the superintendent and the\nofficials that you and the other stockholders pay to manage the mills\nfor you. It was an accident. It was caused by his trying to save the\ncompany a few dollars. The toothed drum of the picker caught his arm. He\nmight have let the small flint that he saw in the teeth go through. It\nwould have smashed out a double row of spikes. But he reached for the\nflint, and his arm was picked and clawed to shreds from the finger tips\nto the shoulder. It was at night. The mills were working overtime. They\npaid a fat dividend that quarter. Jackson had been working many hours,\nand his muscles had lost their resiliency and snap. They made his\nmovements a bit slow. That was why the machine caught him. He had a wife\nand three children.\"\n\n\"And what did the company do for him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing. Oh, yes, they did do something. They successfully fought the\ndamage suit he brought when he came out of hospital. The company employs\nvery efficient lawyers, you know.\"\n\n\"You have not told the whole story,\" I said with conviction. \"Or else\nyou do not know the whole story. Maybe the man was insolent.\"\n\n\"Insolent! Ha! ha!\" His laughter was Mephistophelian. \"Great God!\nInsolent! And with his arm chewed off! Nevertheless he was a meek and\nlowly servant, and there is no record of his having been insolent.\"\n\n\"But the courts,\" I urged. \"The case would not have been decided against\nhim had there been no more to the affair than you have mentioned.\"\n\n\"Colonel Ingram is leading counsel for the company. He is a shrewd\nlawyer.\" Ernest looked at me intently for a moment, then went on. \"I'll\ntell you what you do, Miss Cunningham. You investigate Jackson's case.\"\n\n\"I had already determined to,\" I said coldly.\n\n\"All right,\" he beamed good-naturedly, \"and I'll tell you where to\nfind him. But I tremble for you when I think of all you are to prove by\nJackson's arm.\"\n\nAnd so it came about that both the Bishop and I accepted Ernest's\nchallenges. They went away together, leaving me smarting with a sense\nof injustice that had been done me and my class. The man was a beast. I\nhated him, then, and consoled myself with the thought that his behavior\nwas what was to be expected from a man of the working class.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nJACKSON'S ARM.\n\n\nLittle did I dream the fateful part Jackson's arm was to play in my\nlife. Jackson himself did not impress me when I hunted him out. I found\nhim in a crazy, ramshackle* house down near the bay on the edge of the\nmarsh. Pools of stagnant water stood around the house, their surfaces\ncovered with a green and putrid-looking scum, while the stench that\narose from them was intolerable.\n\n     * An adjective descriptive of ruined and dilapidated houses\n     in which great numbers of the working people found shelter\n     in those days.  They invariably paid rent, and, considering\n     the value of such houses, enormous rent, to the landlords.\n\nI found Jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described. He was\nmaking some sort of rattan-work, and he toiled on stolidly while I\ntalked with him. But in spite of his meekness and lowliness, I fancied I\ncaught the first note of a nascent bitterness in him when he said:\n\n\"They might a-given me a job as watchman,* anyway.\"\n\n     * In those days thievery was incredibly prevalent.\n     Everybody stole property from everybody else.  The lords of\n     society stole legally or else legalized their stealing,\n     while the poorer classes stole illegally.  Nothing was safe\n     unless guarded.  Enormous numbers of men were employed as\n     watchmen to protect property.  The houses of the well-to-do\n     were a combination of safe deposit vault and fortress.  The\n     appropriation of the personal belongings of others by our\n     own children of to-day is looked upon as a rudimentary\n     survival of the theft-characteristic that in those early\n     times was universal.\n\nI got little out of him. He struck me as stupid, and yet the deftness\nwith which he worked with his one hand seemed to belie his stupidity.\nThis suggested an idea to me.\n\n\"How did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine?\" I asked.\n\nHe looked at me in a slow and pondering way, and shook his head. \"I\ndon't know. It just happened.\"\n\n\"Carelessness?\" I prompted.\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"I ain't for callin' it that. I was workin' overtime,\nan' I guess I was tired out some. I worked seventeen years in them\nmills, an' I've took notice that most of the accidents happens just\nbefore whistle-blow.* I'm willin' to bet that more accidents happens\nin the hour before whistle-blow than in all the rest of the day. A man\nain't so quick after workin' steady for hours. I've seen too many of 'em\ncut up an' gouged an' chawed not to know.\"\n\n     * The laborers were called to work and dismissed by savage,\n     screaming, nerve-racking steam-whistles.\n\n\"Many of them?\" I queried.\n\n\"Hundreds an' hundreds, an' children, too.\"\n\nWith the exception of the terrible details, Jackson's story of his\naccident was the same as that I had already heard. When I asked him if\nhe had broken some rule of working the machinery, he shook his head.\n\n\"I chucked off the belt with my right hand,\" he said, \"an' made a reach\nfor the flint with my left. I didn't stop to see if the belt was off. I\nthought my right hand had done it--only it didn't. I reached quick, and\nthe belt wasn't all the way off. And then my arm was chewed off.\"\n\n\"It must have been painful,\" I said sympathetically.\n\n\"The crunchin' of the bones wasn't nice,\" was his answer.\n\nHis mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit. Only one thing was\nclear to him, and that was that he had not got any damages. He had a\nfeeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had\nbrought about the adverse decision of the court. Their testimony, as he\nput it, \"wasn't what it ought to have ben.\" And to them I resolved to\ngo.\n\nOne thing was plain, Jackson's situation was wretched. His wife was in\nill health, and he was unable to earn, by his rattan-work and peddling,\nsufficient food for the family. He was back in his rent, and the oldest\nboy, a lad of eleven, had started to work in the mills.\n\n\"They might a-given me that watchman's job,\" were his last words as I\nwent away.\n\nBy the time I had seen the lawyer who had handled Jackson's case, and\nthe two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had testified, I\nbegan to feel that there was something after all in Ernest's contention.\n\nHe was a weak and inefficient-looking man, the lawyer, and at sight of\nhim I did not wonder that Jackson's case had been lost. My first thought\nwas that it had served Jackson right for getting such a lawyer. But\nthe next moment two of Ernest's statements came flashing into my\nconsciousness: \"The company employs very efficient lawyers\" and \"Colonel\nIngram is a shrewd lawyer.\" I did some rapid thinking. It dawned upon me\nthat of course the company could afford finer legal talent than could a\nworkingman like Jackson. But this was merely a minor detail. There was\nsome very good reason, I was sure, why Jackson's case had gone against\nhim.\n\n\"Why did you lose the case?\" I asked.\n\nThe lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment, and I found it in my\nheart to pity the wretched little creature. Then he began to whine. I\ndo believe his whine was congenital. He was a man beaten at birth. He\nwhined about the testimony. The witnesses had given only the evidence\nthat helped the other side. Not one word could he get out of them that\nwould have helped Jackson. They knew which side their bread was buttered\non. Jackson was a fool. He had been brow-beaten and confused by Colonel\nIngram. Colonel Ingram was brilliant at cross-examination. He had made\nJackson answer damaging questions.\n\n\"How could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his side?\" I\ndemanded.\n\n\"What's right got to do with it?\" he demanded back. \"You see all those\nbooks.\" He moved his hand over the array of volumes on the walls of his\ntiny office. \"All my reading and studying of them has taught me that\nlaw is one thing and right is another thing. Ask any lawyer. You go to\nSunday-school to learn what is right. But you go to those books to learn\n. . . law.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that Jackson had the right on his side and yet\nwas beaten?\" I queried tentatively. \"Do you mean to tell me that there\nis no justice in Judge Caldwell's court?\"\n\nThe little lawyer glared at me a moment, and then the belligerence faded\nout of his face.\n\n\"I hadn't a fair chance,\" he began whining again. \"They made a fool out\nof Jackson and out of me, too. What chance had I? Colonel Ingram is\na great lawyer. If he wasn't great, would he have charge of the law\nbusiness of the Sierra Mills, of the Erston Land Syndicate, of the\nBerkeley Consolidated, of the Oakland, San Leandro, and Pleasanton\nElectric? He's a corporation lawyer, and corporation lawyers are not\npaid for being fools.* What do you think the Sierra Mills alone give him\ntwenty thousand dollars a year for? Because he's worth twenty thousand\ndollars a year to them, that's what for. I'm not worth that much. If\nI was, I wouldn't be on the outside, starving and taking cases like\nJackson's. What do you think I'd have got if I'd won Jackson's case?\"\n\n     * The function of the corporation lawyer was to serve, by\n     corrupt methods, the money-grabbing propensities of the\n     corporations.  It is on record that Theodore Roosevelt, at\n     that time President of the United States, said in 1905 A.D.,\n     in his address at Harvard Commencement: \"We all know that,\n     as things actually are, many of the most influential and\n     most highly remunerated members of the Bar in every centre\n     of wealth, make it their special task to work out bold and\n     ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients, individual\n     or corporate, can evade the laws which were made to\n     regulate, in the interests of the public, the uses of great\n     wealth.\"\n\n\"You'd have robbed him, most probably,\" I answered.\n\n\"Of course I would,\" he cried angrily. \"I've got to live, haven't I?\"*\n\n     * A typical illustration of the internecine strife that\n     permeated all society.  Men preyed upon one another like\n     ravening wolves. The big wolves ate the little wolves, and\n     in the social pack Jackson was one of the least of the\n     little wolves.\n\n\"He has a wife and children,\" I chided.\n\n\"So have I a wife and children,\" he retorted. \"And there's not a soul in\nthis world except myself that cares whether they starve or not.\"\n\nHis face suddenly softened, and he opened his watch and showed me a\nsmall photograph of a woman and two little girls pasted inside the case.\n\n\"There they are. Look at them. We've had a hard time, a hard time. I\nhad hoped to send them away to the country if I'd won Jackson's case.\nThey're not healthy here, but I can't afford to send them away.\"\n\nWhen I started to leave, he dropped back into his whine.\n\n\"I hadn't the ghost of a chance. Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell\nare pretty friendly. I'm not saying that if I'd got the right kind of\ntestimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination, that friendship\nwould have decided the case. And yet I must say that Judge Caldwell\ndid a whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony. Why, Judge\nCaldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club.\nThey live in the same neighborhood--one I can't afford. And their wives\nare always in and out of each other's houses. They're always having\nwhist parties and such things back and forth.\"\n\n\"And yet you think Jackson had the right of it?\" I asked, pausing for\nthe moment on the threshold.\n\n\"I don't think; I know it,\" was his answer. \"And at first I thought\nhe had some show, too. But I didn't tell my wife. I didn't want to\ndisappoint her. She had her heart set on a trip to the country hard\nenough as it was.\"\n\n\"Why did you not call attention to the fact that Jackson was trying to\nsave the machinery from being injured?\" I asked Peter Donnelly, one of\nthe foremen who had testified at the trial.\n\nHe pondered a long time before replying. Then he cast an anxious look\nabout him and said:\n\n\"Because I've a good wife an' three of the sweetest children ye ever\nlaid eyes on, that's why.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" I said.\n\n\"In other words, because it wouldn't a-ben healthy,\" he answered.\n\n\"You mean--\" I began.\n\nBut he interrupted passionately.\n\n\"I mean what I said. It's long years I've worked in the mills. I began\nas a little lad on the spindles. I worked up ever since. It's by hard\nwork I got to my present exalted position. I'm a foreman, if you please.\nAn' I doubt me if there's a man in the mills that'd put out a hand to\ndrag me from drownin'. I used to belong to the union. But I've stayed\nby the company through two strikes. They called me 'scab.' There's not\na man among 'em to-day to take a drink with me if I asked him. D'ye see\nthe scars on me head where I was struck with flying bricks? There ain't\na child at the spindles but what would curse me name. Me only friend is\nthe company. It's not me duty, but me bread an' butter an' the life of\nme children to stand by the mills. That's why.\"\n\n\"Was Jackson to blame?\" I asked.\n\n\"He should a-got the damages. He was a good worker an' never made\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Then you were not at liberty to tell the whole truth, as you had sworn\nto do?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\" I said\nsolemnly.\n\nAgain his face became impassioned, and he lifted it, not to me, but to\nheaven.\n\n\"I'd let me soul an' body burn in everlastin' hell for them children of\nmine,\" was his answer.\n\nHenry Dallas, the superintendent, was a vulpine-faced creature who\nregarded me insolently and refused to talk. Not a word could I get from\nhim concerning the trial and his testimony. But with the other foreman I\nhad better luck. James Smith was a hard-faced man, and my heart sank\nas I encountered him. He, too, gave me the impression that he was not a\nfree agent, as we talked I began to see that he was mentally superior\nto the average of his kind. He agreed with Peter Donnelly that Jackson\nshould have got damages, and he went farther and called the action\nheartless and cold-blooded that had turned the worker adrift after he\nhad been made helpless by the accident. Also, he explained that there\nwere many accidents in the mills, and that the company's policy was to\nfight to the bitter end all consequent damage suits.\n\n\"It means hundreds of thousands a year to the stockholders,\" he said;\nand as he spoke I remembered the last dividend that had been paid my\nfather, and the pretty gown for me and the books for him that had been\nbought out of that dividend. I remembered Ernest's charge that my\ngown was stained with blood, and my flesh began to crawl underneath my\ngarments.\n\n\"When you testified at the trial, you didn't point out that Jackson\nreceived his accident through trying to save the machinery from damage?\"\nI said.\n\n\"No, I did not,\" was the answer, and his mouth set bitterly. \"I\ntestified to the effect that Jackson injured himself by neglect and\ncarelessness, and that the company was not in any way to blame or\nliable.\"\n\n\"Was it carelessness?\" I asked.\n\n\"Call it that, or anything you want to call it. The fact is, a man gets\ntired after he's been working for hours.\"\n\nI was becoming interested in the man. He certainly was of a superior\nkind.\n\n\"You are better educated than most workingmen,\" I said.\n\n\"I went through high school,\" he replied. \"I worked my way through doing\njanitor-work. I wanted to go through the university. But my father died,\nand I came to work in the mills.\n\n\"I wanted to become a naturalist,\" he explained shyly, as though\nconfessing a weakness. \"I love animals. But I came to work in the mills.\nWhen I was promoted to foreman I got married, then the family came, and\n. . . well, I wasn't my own boss any more.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" I asked.\n\n\"I was explaining why I testified at the trial the way I did--why I\nfollowed instructions.\"\n\n\"Whose instructions?\"\n\n\"Colonel Ingram. He outlined the evidence I was to give.\"\n\n\"And it lost Jackson's case for him.\"\n\nHe nodded, and the blood began to rise darkly in his face.\n\n\"And Jackson had a wife and two children dependent on him.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said quietly, though his face was growing darker.\n\n\"Tell me,\" I went on, \"was it easy to make yourself over from what you\nwere, say in high school, to the man you must have become to do such a\nthing at the trial?\"\n\nThe suddenness of his outburst startled and frightened me. He ripped*\nout a savage oath, and clenched his fist as though about to strike me.\n\n     * It is interesting to note the virilities of language that\n     were common speech in that day, as indicative of the life,\n     'red of claw and fang,' that was then lived.  Reference is\n     here made, of course, not to the oath of Smith, but to the\n     verb ripped used by Avis Everhard.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said the next moment. \"No, it was not easy. And\nnow I guess you can go away. You've got all you wanted out of me. But\nlet me tell you this before you go. It won't do you any good to repeat\nanything I've said. I'll deny it, and there are no witnesses. I'll deny\nevery word of it; and if I have to, I'll do it under oath on the witness\nstand.\"\n\nAfter my interview with Smith I went to my father's office in\nthe Chemistry Building and there encountered Ernest. It was quite\nunexpected, but he met me with his bold eyes and firm hand-clasp, and\nwith that curious blend of his awkwardness and ease. It was as though\nour last stormy meeting was forgotten; but I was not in the mood to have\nit forgotten.\n\n\"I have been looking up Jackson's case,\" I said abruptly.\n\nHe was all interested attention, and waited for me to go on, though I\ncould see in his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been shaken.\n\n\"He seems to have been badly treated,\" I confessed. \"I--I--think some of\nhis blood is dripping from our roof-beams.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he answered. \"If Jackson and all his fellows were treated\nmercifully, the dividends would not be so large.\"\n\n\"I shall never be able to take pleasure in pretty gowns again,\" I added.\n\nI felt humble and contrite, and was aware of a sweet feeling that\nErnest was a sort of father confessor. Then, as ever after, his strength\nappealed to me. It seemed to radiate a promise of peace and protection.\n\n\"Nor will you be able to take pleasure in sackcloth,\" he said gravely.\n\"There are the jute mills, you know, and the same thing goes on there.\nIt goes on everywhere. Our boasted civilization is based upon blood,\nsoaked in blood, and neither you nor I nor any of us can escape the\nscarlet stain. The men you talked with--who were they?\"\n\nI told him all that had taken place.\n\n\"And not one of them was a free agent,\" he said. \"They were all tied to\nthe merciless industrial machine. And the pathos of it and the tragedy\nis that they are tied by their heartstrings. Their children--always\nthe young life that it is their instinct to protect. This instinct is\nstronger than any ethic they possess. My father! He lied, he stole, he\ndid all sorts of dishonorable things to put bread into my mouth and into\nthe mouths of my brothers and sisters. He was a slave to the industrial\nmachine, and it stamped his life out, worked him to death.\"\n\n\"But you,\" I interjected. \"You are surely a free agent.\"\n\n\"Not wholly,\" he replied. \"I am not tied by my heartstrings. I am often\nthankful that I have no children, and I dearly love children. Yet if I\nmarried I should not dare to have any.\"\n\n\"That surely is bad doctrine,\" I cried.\n\n\"I know it is,\" he said sadly. \"But it is expedient doctrine. I am a\nrevolutionist, and it is a perilous vocation.\"\n\nI laughed incredulously.\n\n\"If I tried to enter your father's house at night to steal his dividends\nfrom the Sierra Mills, what would he do?\"\n\n\"He sleeps with a revolver on the stand by the bed,\" I answered. \"He\nwould most probably shoot you.\"\n\n\"And if I and a few others should lead a million and a half of men*\ninto the houses of all the well-to-do, there would be a great deal of\nshooting, wouldn't there?\"\n\n     * This reference is to the socialist vote cast in the United\n     States in 1910.  The rise of this vote clearly indicates the\n     swift growth of the party of revolution.  Its voting\n     strength in the United States in 1888 was 2068; in 1902,\n     127,713; in 1904, 435,040; in 1908, 1,108,427; and in 1910,\n     1,688,211.\n\n\"Yes, but you are not doing that,\" I objected.\n\n\"It is precisely what I am doing. And we intend to take, not the mere\nwealth in the houses, but all the sources of that wealth, all the\nmines, and railroads, and factories, and banks, and stores. That is\nthe revolution. It is truly perilous. There will be more shooting, I am\nafraid, than even I dream of. But as I was saying, no one to-day is\na free agent. We are all caught up in the wheels and cogs of the\nindustrial machine. You found that you were, and that the men you talked\nwith were. Talk with more of them. Go and see Colonel Ingram. Look\nup the reporters that kept Jackson's case out of the papers, and the\neditors that run the papers. You will find them all slaves of the\nmachine.\"\n\nA little later in our conversation I asked him a simple little\nquestion about the liability of workingmen to accidents, and received a\nstatistical lecture in return.\n\n\"It is all in the books,\" he said. \"The figures have been gathered, and\nit has been proved conclusively that accidents rarely occur in the\nfirst hours of the morning work, but that they increase rapidly in the\nsucceeding hours as the workers grow tired and slower in both their\nmuscular and mental processes.\n\n\"Why, do you know that your father has three times as many chances for\nsafety of life and limb than has a working-man? He has. The insurance*\ncompanies know. They will charge him four dollars and twenty cents a\nyear on a thousand-dollar accident policy, and for the same policy they\nwill charge a laborer fifteen dollars.\"\n\n     * In the terrible wolf-struggle of those centuries, no man\n     was permanently safe, no matter how much wealth he amassed.\n     Out of fear for the welfare of their families, men devised\n     the scheme of insurance.  To us, in this intelligent age,\n     such a device is laughably absurd and primitive.  But in\n     that age insurance was a very serious matter.  The amusing\n     part of it is that the funds of the insurance companies were\n     frequently plundered and wasted by the very officials who\n     were intrusted with the management of them.\n\n\"And you?\" I asked; and in the moment of asking I was aware of a\nsolicitude that was something more than slight.\n\n\"Oh, as a revolutionist, I have about eight chances to the workingman's\none of being injured or killed,\" he answered carelessly. \"The insurance\ncompanies charge the highly trained chemists that handle explosives\neight times what they charge the workingmen. I don't think they'd insure\nme at all. Why did you ask?\"\n\nMy eyes fluttered, and I could feel the blood warm in my face. It\nwas not that he had caught me in my solicitude, but that I had caught\nmyself, and in his presence.\n\nJust then my father came in and began making preparations to depart with\nme. Ernest returned some books he had borrowed, and went away first. But\njust as he was going, he turned and said:\n\n\"Oh, by the way, while you are ruining your own peace of mind and I\nam ruining the Bishop's, you'd better look up Mrs. Wickson and\nMrs. Pertonwaithe. Their husbands, you know, are the two principal\nstockholders in the Mills. Like all the rest of humanity, those two\nwomen are tied to the machine, but they are so tied that they sit on top\nof it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nSLAVES OF THE MACHINE\n\n\nThe more I thought of Jackson's arm, the more shaken I was. I was\nconfronted by the concrete. For the first time I was seeing life. My\nuniversity life, and study and culture, had not been real. I had learned\nnothing but theories of life and society that looked all very well on\nthe printed page, but now I had seen life itself. Jackson's arm was a\nfact of life. \"The fact, man, the irrefragable fact!\" of Ernest's was\nringing in my consciousness.\n\nIt seemed monstrous, impossible, that our whole society was based\nupon blood. And yet there was Jackson. I could not get away from him.\nConstantly my thought swung back to him as the compass to the Pole. He\nhad been monstrously treated. His blood had not been paid for in order\nthat a larger dividend might be paid. And I knew a score of happy\ncomplacent families that had received those dividends and by that much\nhad profited by Jackson's blood. If one man could be so monstrously\ntreated and society move on its way unheeding, might not many men be so\nmonstrously treated? I remembered Ernest's women of Chicago who toiled\nfor ninety cents a week, and the child slaves of the Southern cotton\nmills he had described. And I could see their wan white hands, from\nwhich the blood had been pressed, at work upon the cloth out of which\nhad been made my gown. And then I thought of the Sierra Mills and the\ndividends that had been paid, and I saw the blood of Jackson upon my\ngown as well. Jackson I could not escape. Always my meditations led me\nback to him.\n\nDown in the depths of me I had a feeling that I stood on the edge of\na precipice. It was as though I were about to see a new and awful\nrevelation of life. And not I alone. My whole world was turning over.\nThere was my father. I could see the effect Ernest was beginning to have\non him. And then there was the Bishop. When I had last seen him he had\nlooked a sick man. He was at high nervous tension, and in his eyes there\nwas unspeakable horror. From the little I learned I knew that Ernest had\nbeen keeping his promise of taking him through hell. But what scenes of\nhell the Bishop's eyes had seen, I knew not, for he seemed too stunned\nto speak about them.\n\nOnce, the feeling strong upon me that my little world and all the world\nwas turning over, I thought of Ernest as the cause of it; and also I\nthought, \"We were so happy and peaceful before he came!\" And the next\nmoment I was aware that the thought was a treason against truth, and\nErnest rose before me transfigured, the apostle of truth, with shining\nbrows and the fearlessness of one of Gods own angels, battling for the\ntruth and the right, and battling for the succor of the poor and lonely\nand oppressed. And then there arose before me another figure, the\nChrist! He, too, had taken the part of the lowly and oppressed,\nand against all the established power of priest and pharisee. And I\nremembered his end upon the cross, and my heart contracted with a pang\nas I thought of Ernest. Was he, too, destined for a cross?--he, with his\nclarion call and war-noted voice, and all the fine man's vigor of him!\n\nAnd in that moment I knew that I loved him, and that I was melting\nwith desire to comfort him. I thought of his life. A sordid, harsh, and\nmeagre life it must have been. And I thought of his father, who had lied\nand stolen for him and been worked to death. And he himself had gone\ninto the mills when he was ten! All my heart seemed bursting with desire\nto fold my arms around him, and to rest his head on my breast--his head\nthat must be weary with so many thoughts; and to give him rest--just\nrest--and easement and forgetfulness for a tender space.\n\nI met Colonel Ingram at a church reception. Him I knew well and had\nknown well for many years. I trapped him behind large palms and rubber\nplants, though he did not know he was trapped. He met me with the\nconventional gayety and gallantry. He was ever a graceful man,\ndiplomatic, tactful, and considerate. And as for appearance, he was\nthe most distinguished-looking man in our society. Beside him even the\nvenerable head of the university looked tawdry and small.\n\nAnd yet I found Colonel Ingram situated the same as the unlettered\nmechanics. He was not a free agent. He, too, was bound upon the wheel.\nI shall never forget the change in him when I mentioned Jackson's case.\nHis smiling good nature vanished like a ghost. A sudden, frightful\nexpression distorted his well-bred face. I felt the same alarm that I\nhad felt when James Smith broke out. But Colonel Ingram did not curse.\nThat was the slight difference that was left between the workingman and\nhim. He was famed as a wit, but he had no wit now. And, unconsciously,\nthis way and that he glanced for avenues of escape. But he was trapped\namid the palms and rubber trees.\n\nOh, he was sick of the sound of Jackson's name. Why had I brought the\nmatter up? He did not relish my joke. It was poor taste on my part,\nand very inconsiderate. Did I not know that in his profession personal\nfeelings did not count? He left his personal feelings at home when\nhe went down to the office. At the office he had only professional\nfeelings.\n\n\"Should Jackson have received damages?\" I asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he answered. \"That is, personally, I have a feeling that he\nshould. But that has nothing to do with the legal aspects of the case.\"\n\nHe was getting his scattered wits slightly in hand.\n\n\"Tell me, has right anything to do with the law?\" I asked.\n\n\"You have used the wrong initial consonant,\" he smiled in answer.\n\n\"Might?\" I queried; and he nodded his head. \"And yet we are supposed to\nget justice by means of the law?\"\n\n\"That is the paradox of it,\" he countered. \"We do get justice.\"\n\n\"You are speaking professionally now, are you not?\" I asked.\n\nColonel Ingram blushed, actually blushed, and again he looked anxiously\nabout him for a way of escape. But I blocked his path and did not offer\nto move.\n\n\"Tell me,\" I said, \"when one surrenders his personal feelings to his\nprofessional feelings, may not the action be defined as a sort of\nspiritual mayhem?\"\n\nI did not get an answer. Colonel Ingram had ingloriously bolted,\noverturning a palm in his flight.\n\nNext I tried the newspapers. I wrote a quiet, restrained, dispassionate\naccount of Jackson's case. I made no charges against the men with whom\nI had talked, nor, for that matter, did I even mention them. I gave\nthe actual facts of the case, the long years Jackson had worked in the\nmills, his effort to save the machinery from damage and the consequent\naccident, and his own present wretched and starving condition. The\nthree local newspapers rejected my communication, likewise did the two\nweeklies.\n\nI got hold of Percy Layton. He was a graduate of the university, had\ngone in for journalism, and was then serving his apprenticeship as\nreporter on the most influential of the three newspapers. He smiled when\nI asked him the reason the newspapers suppressed all mention of Jackson\nor his case.\n\n\"Editorial policy,\" he said. \"We have nothing to do with that. It's up\nto the editors.\"\n\n\"But why is it policy?\" I asked.\n\n\"We're all solid with the corporations,\" he answered. \"If you paid\nadvertising rates, you couldn't get any such matter into the papers. A\nman who tried to smuggle it in would lose his job. You couldn't get it\nin if you paid ten times the regular advertising rates.\"\n\n\"How about your own policy?\" I questioned. \"It would seem your function\nis to twist truth at the command of your employers, who, in turn, obey\nthe behests of the corporations.\"\n\n\"I haven't anything to do with that.\" He looked uncomfortable for the\nmoment, then brightened as he saw his way out. \"I, myself, do not write\nuntruthful things. I keep square all right with my own conscience. Of\ncourse, there's lots that's repugnant in the course of the day's work.\nBut then, you see, that's all part of the day's work,\" he wound up\nboyishly.\n\n\"Yet you expect to sit at an editor's desk some day and conduct a\npolicy.\"\n\n\"I'll be case-hardened by that time,\" was his reply.\n\n\"Since you are not yet case-hardened, tell me what you think right now\nabout the general editorial policy.\"\n\n\"I don't think,\" he answered quickly. \"One can't kick over the ropes\nif he's going to succeed in journalism. I've learned that much, at any\nrate.\"\n\nAnd he nodded his young head sagely.\n\n\"But the right?\" I persisted.\n\n\"You don't understand the game. Of course it's all right, because it\ncomes out all right, don't you see?\"\n\n\"Delightfully vague,\" I murmured; but my heart was aching for the youth\nof him, and I felt that I must either scream or burst into tears.\n\nI was beginning to see through the appearances of the society in which I\nhad always lived, and to find the frightful realities that were beneath.\nThere seemed a tacit conspiracy against Jackson, and I was aware of a\nthrill of sympathy for the whining lawyer who had ingloriously fought\nhis case. But this tacit conspiracy grew large. Not alone was it aimed\nagainst Jackson. It was aimed against every workingman who was maimed in\nthe mills. And if against every man in the mills, why not against every\nman in all the other mills and factories? In fact, was it not true of\nall the industries?\n\nAnd if this was so, then society was a lie. I shrank back from my own\nconclusions. It was too terrible and awful to be true. But there was\nJackson, and Jackson's arm, and the blood that stained my gown and\ndripped from my own roof-beams. And there were many Jacksons--hundreds\nof them in the mills alone, as Jackson himself had said. Jackson I could\nnot escape.\n\nI saw Mr. Wickson and Mr. Pertonwaithe, the two men who held most of the\nstock in the Sierra Mills. But I could not shake them as I had shaken\nthe mechanics in their employ. I discovered that they had an ethic\nsuperior to that of the rest of society. It was what I may call the\naristocratic ethic or the master ethic.* They talked in large ways of\npolicy, and they identified policy and right. And to me they talked in\nfatherly ways, patronizing my youth and inexperience. They were the most\nhopeless of all I had encountered in my quest. They believed absolutely\nthat their conduct was right. There was no question about it, no\ndiscussion. They were convinced that they were the saviours of society,\nand that it was they who made happiness for the many. And they drew\npathetic pictures of what would be the sufferings of the working class\nwere it not for the employment that they, and they alone, by their\nwisdom, provided for it.\n\n     * Before Avis Everhard was born, John Stuart Mill, in his\n     essay, ON LIBERTY, wrote: \"Wherever there is an ascendant\n     class, a large portion of the morality emanates from its\n     class interests and its class feelings of superiority.\"\n\nFresh from these two masters, I met Ernest and related my experience. He\nlooked at me with a pleased expression, and said:\n\n\"Really, this is fine. You are beginning to dig truth for yourself. It\nis your own empirical generalization, and it is correct. No man in the\nindustrial machine is a free-will agent, except the large capitalist,\nand he isn't, if you'll pardon the Irishism.* You see, the masters\nare quite sure that they are right in what they are doing. That is the\ncrowning absurdity of the whole situation. They are so tied by their\nhuman nature that they can't do a thing unless they think it is right.\nThey must have a sanction for their acts.\n\n     * Verbal contradictions, called BULLS, were long an amiable\n     weakness of the ancient Irish.\n\n\"When they want to do a thing, in business of course, they must wait\ntill there arises in their brains, somehow, a religious, or ethical, or\nscientific, or philosophic, concept that the thing is right. And then\nthey go ahead and do it, unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the\nhuman mind is that the wish is parent to the thought. No matter what\nthey want to do, the sanction always comes. They are superficial\ncasuists. They are Jesuitical. They even see their way to doing wrong\nthat right may come of it. One of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions\nthey have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in\nwisdom and efficiency. Therefrom comes their sanction to manage the\nbread and butter of the rest of mankind. They have even resurrected the\ntheory of the divine right of kings--commercial kings in their case.*\n\n     * The newspapers, in 1902 of that era, credited the\n     president of the Anthracite Coal Trust, George F. Baer, with\n     the enunciation of the following principle: \"The rights and\n     interests of the laboring man will be protected by the\n     Christian men to whom God in His infinite wisdom has given\n     the property interests of the country.\"\n\n\"The weakness in their position lies in that they are merely\nbusiness men. They are not philosophers. They are not biologists nor\nsociologists. If they were, of course all would be well. A business man\nwho was also a biologist and a sociologist would know, approximately,\nthe right thing to do for humanity. But, outside the realm of business,\nthese men are stupid. They know only business. They do not know mankind\nnor society, and yet they set themselves up as arbiters of the fates of\nthe hungry millions and all the other millions thrown in. History, some\nday, will have an excruciating laugh at their expense.\"\n\nI was not surprised when I had my talk out with Mrs. Wickson and Mrs.\nPertonwaithe. They were society women.* Their homes were palaces. They\nhad many homes scattered over the country, in the mountains, on lakes,\nand by the sea. They were tended by armies of servants, and their social\nactivities were bewildering. They patronized the university and the\nchurches, and the pastors especially bowed at their knees in meek\nsubservience.** They were powers, these two women, what of the money\nthat was theirs. The power of subsidization of thought was theirs to a\nremarkable degree, as I was soon to learn under Ernest's tuition.\n\n     * SOCIETY is here used in a restricted sense, a common usage\n     of the times to denote the gilded drones that did no labor,\n     but only glutted themselves at the honey-vats of the\n     workers.  Neither the business men nor the laborers had time\n     or opportunity for SOCIETY. SOCIETY was the creation of the\n     idle rich who toiled not and who in this way played.\n\n     ** \"Bring on your tainted money,\" was the expressed\n     sentiment of the Church during this period.\n\nThey aped their husbands, and talked in the same large ways about\npolicy, and the duties and responsibilities of the rich. They were\nswayed by the same ethic that dominated their husbands--the ethic of\ntheir class; and they uttered glib phrases that their own ears did not\nunderstand.\n\nAlso, they grew irritated when I told them of the deplorable condition\nof Jackson's family, and when I wondered that they had made no\nvoluntary provision for the man. I was told that they thanked no one\nfor instructing them in their social duties. When I asked them flatly\nto assist Jackson, they as flatly refused. The astounding thing about it\nwas that they refused in almost identically the same language, and this\nin face of the fact that I interviewed them separately and that one did\nnot know that I had seen or was going to see the other. Their common\nreply was that they were glad of the opportunity to make it perfectly\nplain that no premium would ever be put on carelessness by them; nor\nwould they, by paying for accident, tempt the poor to hurt themselves in\nthe machinery.*\n\n     * In the files of the OUTLOOK, a critical weekly of the\n     period, in the number dated August 18, 1906, is related the\n     circumstance of a workingman losing his arm, the details of\n     which are quite similar to those of Jackson's case as\n     related by Avis Everhard.\n\nAnd they were sincere, these two women. They were drunk with conviction\nof the superiority of their class and of themselves. They had a\nsanction, in their own class-ethic, for every act they performed. As I\ndrove away from Mrs. Pertonwaithe's great house, I looked back at\nit, and I remembered Ernest's expression that they were bound to the\nmachine, but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE PHILOMATHS\n\n\nErnest was often at the house. Nor was it my father, merely, nor\nthe controversial dinners, that drew him there. Even at that time I\nflattered myself that I played some part in causing his visits, and it\nwas not long before I learned the correctness of my surmise. For never\nwas there such a lover as Ernest Everhard. His gaze and his hand-clasp\ngrew firmer and steadier, if that were possible; and the question that\nhad grown from the first in his eyes, grew only the more imperative.\n\nMy impression of him, the first time I saw him, had been unfavorable.\nThen I had found myself attracted toward him. Next came my repulsion,\nwhen he so savagely attacked my class and me. After that, as I saw that\nhe had not maligned my class, and that the harsh and bitter things he\nsaid about it were justified, I had drawn closer to him again. He became\nmy oracle. For me he tore the sham from the face of society and gave\nme glimpses of reality that were as unpleasant as they were undeniably\ntrue.\n\nAs I have said, there was never such a lover as he. No girl could\nlive in a university town till she was twenty-four and not have love\nexperiences. I had been made love to by beardless sophomores and gray\nprofessors, and by the athletes and the football giants. But not one\nof them made love to me as Ernest did. His arms were around me before I\nknew. His lips were on mine before I could protest or resist. Before his\nearnestness conventional maiden dignity was ridiculous. He swept me off\nmy feet by the splendid invincible rush of him. He did not propose. He\nput his arms around me and kissed me and took it for granted that\nwe should be married. There was no discussion about it. The only\ndiscussion--and that arose afterward--was when we should be married.\n\nIt was unprecedented. It was unreal. Yet, in accordance with Ernest's\ntest of truth, it worked. I trusted my life to it. And fortunate was the\ntrust. Yet during those first days of our love, fear of the future\ncame often to me when I thought of the violence and impetuosity of his\nlove-making. Yet such fears were groundless. No woman was ever blessed\nwith a gentler, tenderer husband. This gentleness and violence on\nhis part was a curious blend similar to the one in his carriage of\nawkwardness and ease. That slight awkwardness! He never got over it,\nand it was delicious. His behavior in our drawing-room reminded me of a\ncareful bull in a china shop.*\n\n     * In those days it was still the custom to fill the living\n     rooms with bric-a-brac.  They had not discovered simplicity\n     of living. Such rooms were museums, entailing endless labor\n     to keep clean. The dust-demon was the lord of the household.\n     There were a myriad devices for catching dust, and only a\n     few devices for getting rid of it.\n\nIt was at this time that vanished my last doubt of the completeness of\nmy love for him (a subconscious doubt, at most). It was at the Philomath\nClub--a wonderful night of battle, wherein Ernest bearded the masters\nin their lair. Now the Philomath Club was the most select on the Pacific\nCoast. It was the creation of Miss Brentwood, an enormously wealthy old\nmaid; and it was her husband, and family, and toy. Its members were the\nwealthiest in the community, and the strongest-minded of the wealthy,\nwith, of course, a sprinkling of scholars to give it intellectual tone.\n\nThe Philomath had no club house. It was not that kind of a club. Once a\nmonth its members gathered at some one of their private houses to listen\nto a lecture. The lecturers were usually, though not always, hired. If a\nchemist in New York made a new discovery in say radium, all his expenses\nacross the continent were paid, and as well he received a princely fee\nfor his time. The same with a returning explorer from the polar regions,\nor the latest literary or artistic success. No visitors were allowed,\nwhile it was the Philomath's policy to permit none of its discussions\nto get into the papers. Thus great statesmen--and there had been such\noccasions--were able fully to speak their minds.\n\nI spread before me a wrinkled letter, written to me by Ernest twenty\nyears ago, and from it I copy the following:\n\n\"Your father is a member of the Philomath, so you are able to come.\nTherefore come next Tuesday night. I promise you that you will have the\ntime of your life. In your recent encounters, you failed to shake the\nmasters. If you come, I'll shake them for you. I'll make them snarl like\nwolves. You merely questioned their morality. When their morality is\nquestioned, they grow only the more complacent and superior. But I shall\nmenace their money-bags. That will shake them to the roots of their\nprimitive natures. If you can come, you will see the cave-man, in\nevening dress, snarling and snapping over a bone. I promise you a great\ncaterwauling and an illuminating insight into the nature of the beast.\n\n\"They've invited me in order to tear me to pieces. This is the idea of\nMiss Brentwood. She clumsily hinted as much when she invited me.\nShe's given them that kind of fun before. They delight in getting\ntrustful-souled gentle reformers before them. Miss Brentwood thinks I\nam as mild as a kitten and as good-natured and stolid as the family cow.\nI'll not deny that I helped to give her that impression. She was very\ntentative at first, until she divined my harmlessness. I am to receive\na handsome fee--two hundred and fifty dollars--as befits the man who,\nthough a radical, once ran for governor. Also, I am to wear evening\ndress. This is compulsory. I never was so apparelled in my life. I\nsuppose I'll have to hire one somewhere. But I'd do more than that to\nget a chance at the Philomaths.\"\n\nOf all places, the Club gathered that night at the Pertonwaithe house.\nExtra chairs had been brought into the great drawing-room, and in\nall there must have been two hundred Philomaths that sat down to hear\nErnest. They were truly lords of society. I amused myself with running\nover in my mind the sum of the fortunes represented, and it ran well\ninto the hundreds of millions. And the possessors were not of the idle\nrich. They were men of affairs who took most active parts in industrial\nand political life.\n\nWe were all seated when Miss Brentwood brought Ernest in. They moved\nat once to the head of the room, from where he was to speak. He was\nin evening dress, and, what of his broad shoulders and kingly head, he\nlooked magnificent. And then there was that faint and unmistakable touch\nof awkwardness in his movements. I almost think I could have loved him\nfor that alone. And as I looked at him I was aware of a great joy. I\nfelt again the pulse of his palm on mine, the touch of his lips; and\nsuch pride was mine that I felt I must rise up and cry out to the\nassembled company: \"He is mine! He has held me in his arms, and I,\nmere I, have filled that mind of his to the exclusion of all his\nmultitudinous and kingly thoughts!\"\n\nAt the head of the room, Miss Brentwood introduced him to Colonel Van\nGilbert, and I knew that the latter was to preside. Colonel Van Gilbert\nwas a great corporation lawyer. In addition, he was immensely wealthy.\nThe smallest fee he would deign to notice was a hundred thousand\ndollars. He was a master of law. The law was a puppet with which he\nplayed. He moulded it like clay, twisted and distorted it like a Chinese\npuzzle into any design he chose. In appearance and rhetoric he was\nold-fashioned, but in imagination and knowledge and resource he was as\nyoung as the latest statute. His first prominence had come when he broke\nthe Shardwell will.* His fee for this one act was five hundred thousand\ndollars. From then on he had risen like a rocket. He was often called\nthe greatest lawyer in the country--corporation lawyer, of course; and\nno classification of the three greatest lawyers in the United States\ncould have excluded him.\n\n     * This breaking of wills was a peculiar feature of the\n     period. With the accumulation of vast fortunes, the problem\n     of disposing of these fortunes after death was a vexing one\n     to the accumulators. Will-making and will-breaking became\n     complementary trades, like armor-making and gun-making.  The\n     shrewdest will-making lawyers were called in to make wills\n     that could not be broken.  But these wills were always\n     broken, and very often by the very lawyers that had drawn\n     them up.  Nevertheless the delusion persisted in the wealthy\n     class that an absolutely unbreakable will could be cast; and\n     so, through the generations, clients and lawyers pursued the\n     illusion.  It was a pursuit like unto that of the Universal\n     Solvent of the mediaeval alchemists.\n\nHe arose and began, in a few well-chosen phrases that carried an\nundertone of faint irony, to introduce Ernest. Colonel Van Gilbert was\nsubtly facetious in his introduction of the social reformer and member\nof the working class, and the audience smiled. It made me angry, and\nI glanced at Ernest. The sight of him made me doubly angry. He did not\nseem to resent the delicate slurs. Worse than that, he did not seem to\nbe aware of them. There he sat, gentle, and stolid, and somnolent. He\nreally looked stupid. And for a moment the thought rose in my mind, What\nif he were overawed by this imposing array of power and brains? Then I\nsmiled. He couldn't fool me. But he fooled the others, just as he had\nfooled Miss Brentwood. She occupied a chair right up to the front, and\nseveral times she turned her head toward one or another of her CONFRERES\nand smiled her appreciation of the remarks.\n\nColonel Van Gilbert done, Ernest arose and began to speak. He began in\na low voice, haltingly and modestly, and with an air of evident\nembarrassment. He spoke of his birth in the working class, and of the\nsordidness and wretchedness of his environment, where flesh and spirit\nwere alike starved and tormented. He described his ambitions and ideals,\nand his conception of the paradise wherein lived the people of the upper\nclasses. As he said:\n\n\"Up above me, I knew, were unselfishnesses of the spirit, clean and\nnoble thinking, keen intellectual living. I knew all this because I read\n'Seaside Library'* novels, in which, with the exception of the villains\nand adventuresses, all men and women thought beautiful thoughts, spoke a\nbeautiful tongue, and performed glorious deeds. In short, as I accepted\nthe rising of the sun, I accepted that up above me was all that was fine\nand noble and gracious, all that gave decency and dignity to life, all\nthat made life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail and\nmisery.\"\n\n     * A curious and amazing literature that served to make the\n     working class utterly misapprehend the nature of the leisure\n     class.\n\nHe went on and traced his life in the mills, the learning of the\nhorseshoeing trade, and his meeting with the socialists. Among them, he\nsaid, he had found keen intellects and brilliant wits, ministers of the\nGospel who had been broken because their Christianity was too wide for\nany congregation of mammon-worshippers, and professors who had been\nbroken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class. The\nsocialists were revolutionists, he said, struggling to overthrow the\nirrational society of the present and out of the material to build the\nrational society of the future. Much more he said that would take too\nlong to write, but I shall never forget how he described the life among\nthe revolutionists. All halting utterance vanished. His voice grew\nstrong and confident, and it glowed as he glowed, and as the thoughts\nglowed that poured out from him. He said:\n\n\"Amongst the revolutionists I found, also, warm faith in the human,\nardent idealism, sweetnesses of unselfishness, renunciation, and\nmartyrdom--all the splendid, stinging things of the spirit. Here life\nwas clean, noble, and alive. I was in touch with great souls who exalted\nflesh and spirit over dollars and cents, and to whom the thin wail of\nthe starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of\ncommercial expansion and world empire. All about me were nobleness of\npurpose and heroism of effort, and my days and nights were sunshine\nand starshine, all fire and dew, with before my eyes, ever burning\nand blazing, the Holy Grail, Christ's own Grail, the warm human,\nlong-suffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the last.\"\n\nAs before I had seen him transfigured, so now he stood transfigured\nbefore me. His brows were bright with the divine that was in him, and\nbrighter yet shone his eyes from the midst of the radiance that seemed\nto envelop him as a mantle. But the others did not see this radiance,\nand I assumed that it was due to the tears of joy and love that dimmed\nmy vision. At any rate, Mr. Wickson, who sat behind me, was unaffected,\nfor I heard him sneer aloud, \"Utopian.\"*\n\n     * The people of that age were phrase slaves.  The abjectness\n     of their servitude is incomprehensible to us.  There was a\n     magic in words greater than the conjurer's art.  So\n     befuddled and chaotic were their minds that the utterance of\n     a single word could negative the generalizations of a\n     lifetime of serious research and thought. Such a word was\n     the adjective UTOPIAN.  The mere utterance of it could damn\n     any scheme, no matter how sanely conceived, of economic\n     amelioration or regeneration.  Vast populations grew\n     frenzied over such phrases as \"an honest dollar\" and \"a full\n     dinner pail.\"  The coinage of such phrases was considered\n     strokes of genius.\n\nErnest went on to his rise in society, till at last he came in touch\nwith members of the upper classes, and rubbed shoulders with the men\nwho sat in the high places. Then came his disillusionment, and this\ndisillusionment he described in terms that did not flatter his audience.\nHe was surprised at the commonness of the clay. Life proved not to be\nfine and gracious. He was appalled by the selfishness he encountered,\nand what had surprised him even more than that was the absence of\nintellectual life. Fresh from his revolutionists, he was shocked by the\nintellectual stupidity of the master class. And then, in spite of their\nmagnificent churches and well-paid preachers, he had found the masters,\nmen and women, grossly material. It was true that they prattled sweet\nlittle ideals and dear little moralities, but in spite of their prattle\nthe dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic. And they were\nwithout real morality--for instance, that which Christ had preached but\nwhich was no longer preached.\n\n\"I met men,\" he said, \"who invoked the name of the Prince of Peace\nin their diatribes against war, and who put rifles in the hands of\nPinkertons* with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories. I\nmet men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prize-fighting,\nand who, at the same time, were parties to the adulteration of food that\nkilled each year more babes than even red-handed Herod had killed.\n\n     * Originally, they were private detectives; but they quickly\n     became hired fighting men of the capitalists, and ultimately\n     developed into the Mercenaries of the Oligarchy.\n\n\"This delicate, aristocratic-featured gentleman was a dummy director\nand a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans. This\ngentleman, who collected fine editions and was a patron of literature,\npaid blackmail to a heavy-jowled, black-browed boss of a municipal\nmachine. This editor, who published patent medicine advertisements,\ncalled me a scoundrelly demagogue because I dared him to print in his\npaper the truth about patent medicines.* This man, talking soberly and\nearnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of God, had\njust betrayed his comrades in a business deal. This man, a pillar of the\nchurch and heavy contributor to foreign missions, worked his shop girls\nten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged\nprostitution. This man, who endowed chairs in universities and erected\nmagnificent chapels, perjured himself in courts of law over dollars\nand cents. This railroad magnate broke his word as a citizen, as a\ngentleman, and as a Christian, when he granted a secret rebate, and he\ngranted many secret rebates. This senator was the tool and the slave,\nthe little puppet, of a brutal uneducated machine boss;** so was this\ngovernor and this supreme court judge; and all three rode on railroad\npasses; and, also, this sleek capitalist owned the machine, the machine\nboss, and the railroads that issued the passes.\n\n     * PATENT MEDICINES were patent lies, but, like the charms\n     and indulgences of the Middle Ages, they deceived the\n     people.  The only difference lay in that the patent\n     medicines were more harmful and more costly.\n\n     ** Even as late as 1912, A.D., the great mass of the people\n     still persisted in the belief that they ruled the country by\n     virtue of their ballots.  In reality, the country was ruled\n     by what were called POLITICAL MACHINES.  At first the\n     machine bosses charged the master capitalists extortionate\n     tolls for legislation; but in a short time the master\n     capitalists found it cheaper to own the political machines\n     themselves and to hire the machine bosses.\n\n\"And so it was, instead of in paradise, that I found myself in the\narid desert of commercialism. I found nothing but stupidity, except for\nbusiness. I found none clean, noble, and alive, though I found many who\nwere alive--with rottenness. What I did find was monstrous selfishness\nand heartlessness, and a gross, gluttonous, practised, and practical\nmaterialism.\"\n\nMuch more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.\nIntellectually they had bored him; morally and spiritually they had\nsickened him; so that he was glad to go back to his revolutionists, who\nwere clean, noble, and alive, and all that the capitalists were not.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"let me tell you about that revolution.\"\n\nBut first I must say that his terrible diatribe had not touched them. I\nlooked about me at their faces and saw that they remained complacently\nsuperior to what he had charged. And I remembered what he had told me:\nthat no indictment of their morality could shake them. However, I could\nsee that the boldness of his language had affected Miss Brentwood. She\nwas looking worried and apprehensive.\n\nErnest began by describing the army of revolution, and as he gave the\nfigures of its strength (the votes cast in the various countries), the\nassemblage began to grow restless. Concern showed in their faces, and I\nnoticed a tightening of lips. At last the gage of battle had been thrown\ndown. He described the international organization of the socialists that\nunited the million and a half in the United States with the twenty-three\nmillions and a half in the rest of the world.\n\n\"Such an army of revolution,\" he said, \"twenty-five millions strong, is\na thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider. The cry\nof this army is: 'No quarter! We want all that you possess. We will\nbe content with nothing less than all that you possess. We want in our\nhands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind. Here are our hands.\nThey are strong hands. We are going to take your governments, your\npalaces, and all your purpled ease away from you, and in that day\nyou shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the\nstarved and runty clerk in your metropolises. Here are our hands. They\nare strong hands!'\"\n\nAnd as he spoke he extended from his splendid shoulders his two great\narms, and the horseshoer's hands were clutching the air like eagle's\ntalons. He was the spirit of regnant labor as he stood there, his hands\noutreaching to rend and crush his audience. I was aware of a faintly\nperceptible shrinking on the part of the listeners before this figure\nof revolution, concrete, potential, and menacing. That is, the women\nshrank, and fear was in their faces. Not so with the men. They were\nof the active rich, and not the idle, and they were fighters. A low,\nthroaty rumble arose, lingered on the air a moment, and ceased. It\nwas the forerunner of the snarl, and I was to hear it many times that\nnight--the token of the brute in man, the earnest of his primitive\npassions. And they were unconscious that they had made this sound.\nIt was the growl of the pack, mouthed by the pack, and mouthed in all\nunconsciousness. And in that moment, as I saw the harshness form in\ntheir faces and saw the fight-light flashing in their eyes, I realized\nthat not easily would they let their lordship of the world be wrested\nfrom them.\n\nErnest proceeded with his attack. He accounted for the existence of the\nmillion and a half of revolutionists in the United States by charging\nthe capitalist class with having mismanaged society. He sketched the\neconomic condition of the cave-man and of the savage peoples of to-day,\npointing out that they possessed neither tools nor machines, and\npossessed only a natural efficiency of one in producing power. Then\nhe traced the development of machinery and social organization so that\nto-day the producing power of civilized man was a thousand times greater\nthan that of the savage.\n\n\"Five men,\" he said, \"can produce bread for a thousand. One man can\nproduce cotton cloth for two hundred and fifty people, woollens for\nthree hundred, and boots and shoes for a thousand. One would conclude\nfrom this that under a capable management of society modern civilized\nman would be a great deal better off than the cave-man. But is he? Let\nus see. In the United States to-day there are fifteen million* people\nliving in poverty; and by poverty is meant that condition in life in\nwhich, through lack of food and adequate shelter, the mere standard of\nworking efficiency cannot be maintained. In the United States to-day, in\nspite of all your so-called labor legislation, there are three millions\nof child laborers.** In twelve years their numbers have been doubled.\nAnd in passing I will ask you managers of society why you did not make\npublic the census figures of 1910? And I will answer for you, that\nyou were afraid. The figures of misery would have precipitated the\nrevolution that even now is gathering.\n\n     * Robert Hunter, in 1906, in a book entitled \"Poverty,\"\n     pointed out that at that time there were ten millions in the\n     United States living in poverty.\n\n     ** In the United States Census of 1900 (the last census the\n     figures of which were made public), the number of child\n     laborers was placed at 1,752,187.\n\n\"But to return to my indictment. If modern man's producing power is\na thousand times greater than that of the cave-man, why then, in the\nUnited States to-day, are there fifteen million people who are not\nproperly sheltered and properly fed? Why then, in the United States\nto-day, are there three million child laborers? It is a true indictment.\nThe capitalist class has mismanaged. In face of the facts that modern\nman lives more wretchedly than the cave-man, and that his producing\npower is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man, no other\nconclusion is possible than that the capitalist class has mismanaged,\nthat you have mismanaged, my masters, that you have criminally and\nselfishly mismanaged. And on this count you cannot answer me here\nto-night, face to face, any more than can your whole class answer the\nmillion and a half of revolutionists in the United States. You cannot\nanswer. I challenge you to answer. And furthermore, I dare to say to\nyou now that when I have finished you will not answer. On that point\nyou will be tongue-tied, though you will talk wordily enough about other\nthings.\n\n\"You have failed in your management. You have made a shambles of\ncivilization. You have been blind and greedy. You have risen up (as you\nto-day rise up), shamelessly, in our legislative halls, and declared\nthat profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes.\nDon't take my word for it. It is all in the records against you. You\nhave lulled your conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and\ndear moralities. You are fat with power and possession, drunken with\nsuccess; and you have no more hope against us than have the drones,\nclustered about the honey-vats, when the worker-bees spring upon them\nto end their rotund existence. You have failed in your management of\nsociety, and your management is to be taken away from you. A million and\na half of the men of the working class say that they are going to get\nthe rest of the working class to join with them and take the management\naway from you. This is the revolution, my masters. Stop it if you can.\"\n\nFor an appreciable lapse of time Ernest's voice continued to ring\nthrough the great room. Then arose the throaty rumble I had heard\nbefore, and a dozen men were on their feet clamoring for recognition\nfrom Colonel Van Gilbert. I noticed Miss Brentwood's shoulders moving\nconvulsively, and for the moment I was angry, for I thought that she was\nlaughing at Ernest. And then I discovered that it was not laughter,\nbut hysteria. She was appalled by what she had done in bringing this\nfirebrand before her blessed Philomath Club.\n\nColonel Van Gilbert did not notice the dozen men, with passion-wrought\nfaces, who strove to get permission from him to speak. His own face\nwas passion-wrought. He sprang to his feet, waving his arms, and for a\nmoment could utter only incoherent sounds. Then speech poured from him.\nBut it was not the speech of a one-hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer, nor\nwas the rhetoric old-fashioned.\n\n\"Fallacy upon fallacy!\" he cried. \"Never in all my life have I heard so\nmany fallacies uttered in one short hour. And besides, young man, I must\ntell you that you have said nothing new. I learned all that at college\nbefore you were born. Jean Jacques Rousseau enunciated your socialistic\ntheory nearly two centuries ago. A return to the soil, forsooth!\nReversion! Our biology teaches the absurdity of it. It has been\ntruly said that a little learning is a dangerous thing, and you have\nexemplified it to-night with your madcap theories. Fallacy upon fallacy!\nI was never so nauseated in my life with overplus of fallacy. That for\nyour immature generalizations and childish reasonings!\"\n\nHe snapped his fingers contemptuously and proceeded to sit down. There\nwere lip-exclamations of approval on the part of the women, and hoarser\nnotes of confirmation came from the men. As for the dozen men who\nwere clamoring for the floor, half of them began speaking at once. The\nconfusion and babel was indescribable. Never had Mrs. Pertonwaithe's\nspacious walls beheld such a spectacle. These, then, were the cool\ncaptains of industry and lords of society, these snarling, growling\nsavages in evening clothes. Truly Ernest had shaken them when he\nstretched out his hands for their moneybags, his hands that had\nappeared in their eyes as the hands of the fifteen hundred thousand\nrevolutionists.\n\nBut Ernest never lost his head in a situation. Before Colonel Van\nGilbert had succeeded in sitting down, Ernest was on his feet and had\nsprung forward.\n\n\"One at a time!\" he roared at them.\n\nThe sound arose from his great lungs and dominated the human tempest. By\nsheer compulsion of personality he commanded silence.\n\n\"One at a time,\" he repeated softly. \"Let me answer Colonel Van Gilbert.\nAfter that the rest of you can come at me--but one at a time, remember.\nNo mass-plays here. This is not a football field.\n\n\"As for you,\" he went on, turning toward Colonel Van Gilbert, \"you have\nreplied to nothing I have said. You have merely made a few excited and\ndogmatic assertions about my mental caliber. That may serve you in your\nbusiness, but you can't talk to me like that. I am not a workingman,\ncap in hand, asking you to increase my wages or to protect me from the\nmachine at which I work. You cannot be dogmatic with truth when you deal\nwith me. Save that for dealing with your wage-slaves. They will not dare\nreply to you because you hold their bread and butter, their lives, in\nyour hands.\n\n\"As for this return to nature that you say you learned at college before\nI was born, permit me to point out that on the face of it you cannot\nhave learned anything since. Socialism has no more to do with the state\nof nature than has differential calculus with a Bible class. I have\ncalled your class stupid when outside the realm of business. You, sir,\nhave brilliantly exemplified my statement.\"\n\nThis terrible castigation of her hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer was too\nmuch for Miss Brentwood's nerves. Her hysteria became violent, and she\nwas helped, weeping and laughing, out of the room. It was just as well,\nfor there was worse to follow.\n\n\"Don't take my word for it,\" Ernest continued, when the interruption had\nbeen led away. \"Your own authorities with one unanimous voice will prove\nyou stupid. Your own hired purveyors of knowledge will tell you that you\nare wrong. Go to your meekest little assistant instructor of sociology\nand ask him what is the difference between Rousseau's theory of the\nreturn to nature and the theory of socialism; ask your greatest orthodox\nbourgeois political economists and sociologists; question through\nthe pages of every text-book written on the subject and stored on the\nshelves of your subsidized libraries; and from one and all the answer\nwill be that there is nothing congruous between the return to nature and\nsocialism. On the other hand, the unanimous affirmative answer will be\nthat the return to nature and socialism are diametrically opposed to\neach other. As I say, don't take my word for it. The record of your\nstupidity is there in the books, your own books that you never read. And\nso far as your stupidity is concerned, you are but the exemplar of your\nclass.\n\n\"You know law and business, Colonel Van Gilbert. You know how to serve\ncorporations and increase dividends by twisting the law. Very good.\nStick to it. You are quite a figure. You are a very good lawyer, but you\nare a poor historian, you know nothing of sociology, and your biology is\ncontemporaneous with Pliny.\"\n\nHere Colonel Van Gilbert writhed in his chair. There was perfect quiet\nin the room. Everybody sat fascinated--paralyzed, I may say. Such\nfearful treatment of the great Colonel Van Gilbert was unheard of,\nundreamed of, impossible to believe--the great Colonel Van Gilbert\nbefore whom judges trembled when he arose in court. But Ernest never\ngave quarter to an enemy.\n\n\"This is, of course, no reflection on you,\" Ernest said. \"Every man to\nhis trade. Only you stick to your trade, and I'll stick to mine. You\nhave specialized. When it comes to a knowledge of the law, of how\nbest to evade the law or make new law for the benefit of thieving\ncorporations, I am down in the dirt at your feet. But when it comes to\nsociology--my trade--you are down in the dirt at my feet. Remember that.\nRemember, also, that your law is the stuff of a day, and that you are\nnot versatile in the stuff of more than a day. Therefore your\ndogmatic assertions and rash generalizations on things historical and\nsociological are not worth the breath you waste on them.\"\n\nErnest paused for a moment and regarded him thoughtfully, noting his\nface dark and twisted with anger, his panting chest, his writhing body,\nand his slim white hands nervously clenching and unclenching.\n\n\"But it seems you have breath to use, and I'll give you a chance to\nuse it. I indicted your class. Show me that my indictment is wrong. I\npointed out to you the wretchedness of modern man--three million child\nslaves in the United States, without whose labor profits would not be\npossible, and fifteen million under-fed, ill-clothed, and worse-housed\npeople. I pointed out that modern man's producing power through social\norganization and the use of machinery was a thousand times greater than\nthat of the cave-man. And I stated that from these two facts no other\nconclusion was possible than that the capitalist class had mismanaged.\nThis was my indictment, and I specifically and at length challenged you\nto answer it. Nay, I did more. I prophesied that you would not answer.\nIt remains for your breath to smash my prophecy. You called my speech\nfallacy. Show the fallacy, Colonel Van Gilbert. Answer the indictment\nthat I and my fifteen hundred thousand comrades have brought against\nyour class and you.\"\n\nColonel Van Gilbert quite forgot that he was presiding, and that in\ncourtesy he should permit the other clamorers to speak. He was on his\nfeet, flinging his arms, his rhetoric, and his control to the winds,\nalternately abusing Ernest for his youth and demagoguery, and\nsavagely attacking the working class, elaborating its inefficiency and\nworthlessness.\n\n\"For a lawyer, you are the hardest man to keep to a point I ever saw,\"\nErnest began his answer to the tirade. \"My youth has nothing to do with\nwhat I have enunciated. Nor has the worthlessness of the working class.\nI charged the capitalist class with having mismanaged society. You have\nnot answered. You have made no attempt to answer. Why? Is it because you\nhave no answer? You are the champion of this whole audience. Every\none here, except me, is hanging on your lips for that answer. They\nare hanging on your lips for that answer because they have no answer\nthemselves. As for me, as I said before, I know that you not only cannot\nanswer, but that you will not attempt an answer.\"\n\n\"This is intolerable!\" Colonel Van Gilbert cried out. \"This is insult!\"\n\n\"That you should not answer is intolerable,\" Ernest replied gravely.\n\"No man can be intellectually insulted. Insult, in its very nature,\nis emotional. Recover yourself. Give me an intellectual answer to my\nintellectual charge that the capitalist class has mismanaged society.\"\n\nColonel Van Gilbert remained silent, a sullen, superior expression on\nhis face, such as will appear on the face of a man who will not bandy\nwords with a ruffian.\n\n\"Do not be downcast,\" Ernest said. \"Take consolation in the fact that\nno member of your class has ever yet answered that charge.\" He turned to\nthe other men who were anxious to speak. \"And now it's your chance. Fire\naway, and do not forget that I here challenge you to give the answer\nthat Colonel Van Gilbert has failed to give.\"\n\nIt would be impossible for me to write all that was said in the\ndiscussion. I never realized before how many words could be spoken in\nthree short hours. At any rate, it was glorious. The more his opponents\ngrew excited, the more Ernest deliberately excited them. He had an\nencyclopaedic command of the field of knowledge, and by a word or a\nphrase, by delicate rapier thrusts, he punctured them. He named the\npoints of their illogic. This was a false syllogism, that conclusion had\nno connection with the premise, while that next premise was an impostor\nbecause it had cunningly hidden in it the conclusion that was being\nattempted to be proved. This was an error, that was an assumption, and\nthe next was an assertion contrary to ascertained truth as printed in\nall the text-books.\n\nAnd so it went. Sometimes he exchanged the rapier for the club and went\nsmashing amongst their thoughts right and left. And always he demanded\nfacts and refused to discuss theories. And his facts made for them a\nWaterloo. When they attacked the working class, he always retorted, \"The\npot calling the kettle black; that is no answer to the charge that\nyour own face is dirty.\" And to one and all he said: \"Why have you not\nanswered the charge that your class has mismanaged? You have talked\nabout other things and things concerning other things, but you have not\nanswered. Is it because you have no answer?\"\n\nIt was at the end of the discussion that Mr. Wickson spoke. He was the\nonly one that was cool, and Ernest treated him with a respect he had not\naccorded the others.\n\n\"No answer is necessary,\" Mr. Wickson said with slow deliberation. \"I\nhave followed the whole discussion with amazement and disgust. I am\ndisgusted with you gentlemen, members of my class. You have behaved like\nfoolish little schoolboys, what with intruding ethics and the thunder\nof the common politician into such a discussion. You have been\noutgeneralled and outclassed. You have been very wordy, and all you have\ndone is buzz. You have buzzed like gnats about a bear. Gentlemen, there\nstands the bear\" (he pointed at Ernest), \"and your buzzing has only\ntickled his ears.\n\n\"Believe me, the situation is serious. That bear reached out his paws\ntonight to crush us. He has said there are a million and a half of\nrevolutionists in the United States. That is a fact. He has said that\nit is their intention to take away from us our governments, our palaces,\nand all our purpled ease. That, also, is a fact. A change, a great\nchange, is coming in society; but, haply, it may not be the change the\nbear anticipates. The bear has said that he will crush us. What if we\ncrush the bear?\"\n\nThe throat-rumble arose in the great room, and man nodded to man\nwith indorsement and certitude. Their faces were set hard. They were\nfighters, that was certain.\n\n\"But not by buzzing will we crush the bear,\" Mr. Wickson went on coldly\nand dispassionately. \"We will hunt the bear. We will not reply to the\nbear in words. Our reply shall be couched in terms of lead. We are in\npower. Nobody will deny it. By virtue of that power we shall remain in\npower.\"\n\nHe turned suddenly upon Ernest. The moment was dramatic.\n\n\"This, then, is our answer. We have no words to waste on you. When you\nreach out your vaunted strong hands for our palaces and purpled ease,\nwe will show you what strength is. In roar of shell and shrapnel and\nin whine of machine-guns will our answer be couched.* We will grind you\nrevolutionists down under our heel, and we shall walk upon your faces.\nThe world is ours, we are its lords, and ours it shall remain. As for\nthe host of labor, it has been in the dirt since history began, and I\nread history aright. And in the dirt it shall remain so long as I and\nmine and those that come after us have the power. There is the word.\nIt is the king of words--Power. Not God, not Mammon, but Power. Pour it\nover your tongue till it tingles with it. Power.\"\n\n     * To show the tenor of thought, the following definition is\n     quoted from \"The Cynic's Word Book\" (1906 A.D.), written by\n     one Ambrose Bierce, an avowed and confirmed misanthrope of\n     the period: \"Grapeshot, n.  An argument which the future is\n     preparing in answer to the demands of American Socialism.\"\n\n\"I am answered,\" Ernest said quietly. \"It is the only answer that could\nbe given. Power. It is what we of the working class preach. We know,\nand well we know by bitter experience, that no appeal for the right, for\njustice, for humanity, can ever touch you. Your hearts are hard as\nyour heels with which you tread upon the faces of the poor. So we have\npreached power. By the power of our ballots on election day will we take\nyour government away from you--\"\n\n\"What if you do get a majority, a sweeping majority, on election\nday?\" Mr. Wickson broke in to demand. \"Suppose we refuse to turn the\ngovernment over to you after you have captured it at the ballot-box?\"\n\n\"That, also, have we considered,\" Ernest replied. \"And we shall give you\nan answer in terms of lead. Power you have proclaimed the king of words.\nVery good. Power it shall be. And in the day that we sweep to victory at\nthe ballot-box, and you refuse to turn over to us the government we have\nconstitutionally and peacefully captured, and you demand what we are\ngoing to do about it--in that day, I say, we shall answer you; and in\nroar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns shall our answer\nbe couched.\n\n\"You cannot escape us. It is true that you have read history aright. It\nis true that labor has from the beginning of history been in the dirt.\nAnd it is equally true that so long as you and yours and those that come\nafter you have power, that labor shall remain in the dirt. I agree with\nyou. I agree with all that you have said. Power will be the arbiter,\nas it always has been the arbiter. It is a struggle of classes. Just as\nyour class dragged down the old feudal nobility, so shall it be dragged\ndown by my class, the working class. If you will read your biology and\nyour sociology as clearly as you do your history, you will see that this\nend I have described is inevitable. It does not matter whether it is in\none year, ten, or a thousand--your class shall be dragged down. And it\nshall be done by power. We of the labor hosts have conned that word over\ntill our minds are all a-tingle with it. Power. It is a kingly word.\"\n\nAnd so ended the night with the Philomaths.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nADUMBRATIONS\n\n\nIt was about this time that the warnings of coming events began to fall\nabout us thick and fast. Ernest had already questioned father's policy\nof having socialists and labor leaders at his house, and of openly\nattending socialist meetings; and father had only laughed at him for\nhis pains. As for myself, I was learning much from this contact with the\nworking-class leaders and thinkers. I was seeing the other side of\nthe shield. I was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism\nI encountered, though I was appalled by the vast philosophic and\nscientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me. I was\nlearning fast, but I learned not fast enough to realize then the peril\nof our position.\n\nThere were warnings, but I did not heed them. For instance, Mrs.\nPertonwaithe and Mrs. Wickson exercised tremendous social power in\nthe university town, and from them emanated the sentiment that I was a\ntoo-forward and self-assertive young woman with a mischievous penchant\nfor officiousness and interference in other persons' affairs. This\nI thought no more than natural, considering the part I had played\nin investigating the case of Jackson's arm. But the effect of such\na sentiment, enunciated by two such powerful social arbiters, I\nunderestimated.\n\nTrue, I noticed a certain aloofness on the part of my general friends,\nbut this I ascribed to the disapproval that was prevalent in my circles\nof my intended marriage with Ernest. It was not till some time afterward\nthat Ernest pointed out to me clearly that this general attitude of\nmy class was something more than spontaneous, that behind it were the\nhidden springs of an organized conduct. \"You have given shelter to an\nenemy of your class,\" he said. \"And not alone shelter, for you have\ngiven your love, yourself. This is treason to your class. Think not that\nyou will escape being penalized.\"\n\nBut it was before this that father returned one afternoon. Ernest was\nwith me, and we could see that father was angry--philosophically angry.\nHe was rarely really angry; but a certain measure of controlled anger\nhe allowed himself. He called it a tonic. And we could see that he was\ntonic-angry when he entered the room.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he demanded. \"I had luncheon with Wilcox.\"\n\nWilcox was the superannuated president of the university, whose withered\nmind was stored with generalizations that were young in 1870, and which\nhe had since failed to revise.\n\n\"I was invited,\" father announced. \"I was sent for.\"\n\nHe paused, and we waited.\n\n\"Oh, it was done very nicely, I'll allow; but I was reprimanded. I! And\nby that old fossil!\"\n\n\"I'll wager I know what you were reprimanded for,\" Ernest said.\n\n\"Not in three guesses,\" father laughed.\n\n\"One guess will do,\" Ernest retorted. \"And it won't be a guess. It will\nbe a deduction. You were reprimanded for your private life.\"\n\n\"The very thing!\" father cried. \"How did you guess?\"\n\n\"I knew it was coming. I warned you before about it.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did,\" father meditated. \"But I couldn't believe it. At any\nrate, it is only so much more clinching evidence for my book.\"\n\n\"It is nothing to what will come,\" Ernest went on, \"if you persist in\nyour policy of having these socialists and radicals of all sorts at your\nhouse, myself included.\"\n\n\"Just what old Wilcox said. And of all unwarranted things! He said it\nwas in poor taste, utterly profitless, anyway, and not in harmony with\nuniversity traditions and policy. He said much more of the same vague\nsort, and I couldn't pin him down to anything specific. I made it pretty\nawkward for him, and he could only go on repeating himself and telling\nme how much he honored me, and all the world honored me, as a scientist.\nIt wasn't an agreeable task for him. I could see he didn't like it.\"\n\n\"He was not a free agent,\" Ernest said. \"The leg-bar* is not always worn\ngraciously.\"\n\n     * LEG-BAR--the African slaves were so manacled; also\n     criminals.  It was not until the coming of the Brotherhood\n     of Man that the leg-bar passed out of use.\n\n\"Yes. I got that much out of him. He said the university needed ever\nso much more money this year than the state was willing to furnish; and\nthat it must come from wealthy personages who could not but be offended\nby the swerving of the university from its high ideal of the passionless\npursuit of passionless intelligence. When I tried to pin him down to\nwhat my home life had to do with swerving the university from its high\nideal, he offered me a two years' vacation, on full pay, in Europe,\nfor recreation and research. Of course I couldn't accept it under the\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"It would have been far better if you had,\" Ernest said gravely.\n\n\"It was a bribe,\" father protested; and Ernest nodded.\n\n\"Also, the beggar said that there was talk, tea-table gossip and so\nforth, about my daughter being seen in public with so notorious a\ncharacter as you, and that it was not in keeping with university tone\nand dignity. Not that he personally objected--oh, no; but that there was\ntalk and that I would understand.\"\n\nErnest considered this announcement for a moment, and then said, and his\nface was very grave, withal there was a sombre wrath in it:\n\n\"There is more behind this than a mere university ideal. Somebody has\nput pressure on President Wilcox.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" father asked, and his face showed that he was\ninterested rather than frightened.\n\n\"I wish I could convey to you the conception that is dimly forming in my\nown mind,\" Ernest said. \"Never in the history of the world was society\nin so terrific flux as it is right now. The swift changes in our\nindustrial system are causing equally swift changes in our religious,\npolitical, and social structures. An unseen and fearful revolution is\ntaking place in the fibre and structure of society. One can only dimly\nfeel these things. But they are in the air, now, to-day. One can feel\nthe loom of them--things vast, vague, and terrible. My mind recoils from\ncontemplation of what they may crystallize into. You heard Wickson talk\nthe other night. Behind what he said were the same nameless, formless\nthings that I feel. He spoke out of a superconscious apprehension of\nthem.\"\n\n\"You mean . . . ?\" father began, then paused.\n\n\"I mean that there is a shadow of something colossal and menacing that\neven now is beginning to fall across the land. Call it the shadow of an\noligarchy, if you will; it is the nearest I dare approximate it. What\nits nature may be I refuse to imagine.* But what I wanted to say was\nthis: You are in a perilous position--a peril that my own fear enhances\nbecause I am not able even to measure it. Take my advice and accept the\nvacation.\"\n\n     * Though, like Everhard, they did not dream of the nature of\n     it, there were men, even before his time, who caught\n     glimpses of the shadow.  John C. Calhoun said: \"A power has\n     risen up in the government greater than the people\n     themselves, consisting of many and various and powerful\n     interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the\n     cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.\"  And that\n     great humanist, Abraham Lincoln, said, just before his\n     assassination: \"I see in the near future a crisis\n     approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for\n     the safety of my country. . . .  Corporations have been\n     enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow,\n     and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong\n     its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until\n     the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is\n     destroyed.\"\n\n\"But it would be cowardly,\" was the protest.\n\n\"Not at all. You are an old man. You have done your work in the world,\nand a great work. Leave the present battle to youth and strength. We\nyoung fellows have our work yet to do. Avis will stand by my side in\nwhat is to come. She will be your representative in the battle-front.\"\n\n\"But they can't hurt me,\" father objected. \"Thank God I am independent.\nOh, I assure you, I know the frightful persecution they can wage on\na professor who is economically dependent on his university. But I am\nindependent. I have not been a professor for the sake of my salary. I\ncan get along very comfortably on my own income, and the salary is all\nthey can take away from me.\"\n\n\"But you do not realize,\" Ernest answered. \"If all that I fear be so,\nyour private income, your principal itself, can be taken from you just\nas easily as your salary.\"\n\nFather was silent for a few minutes. He was thinking deeply, and I could\nsee the lines of decision forming in his face. At last he spoke.\n\n\"I shall not take the vacation.\" He paused again. \"I shall go on with\nmy book.* You may be wrong, but whether you are wrong or right, I shall\nstand by my guns.\"\n\n     * This book, \"Economics and Education,\" was published in\n     that year. Three copies of it are extant; two at Ardis, and\n     one at Asgard.  It dealt, in elaborate detail, with one\n     factor in the persistence of the established, namely, the\n     capitalistic bias of the universities and common schools.\n     It was a logical and crushing indictment of the whole system\n     of education that developed in the minds of the students\n     only such ideas as were favorable to the capitalistic\n     regime, to the exclusion of all ideas that were inimical and\n     subversive.  The book created a furor, and was promptly\n     suppressed by the Oligarchy.\n\n\"All right,\" Ernest said. \"You are travelling the same path that Bishop\nMorehouse is, and toward a similar smash-up. You'll both be proletarians\nbefore you're done with it.\"\n\nThe conversation turned upon the Bishop, and we got Ernest to explain\nwhat he had been doing with him.\n\n\"He is soul-sick from the journey through hell I have given him. I took\nhim through the homes of a few of our factory workers. I showed him the\nhuman wrecks cast aside by the industrial machine, and he listened to\ntheir life stories. I took him through the slums of San Francisco, and\nin drunkenness, prostitution, and criminality he learned a deeper cause\nthan innate depravity. He is very sick, and, worse than that, he has got\nout of hand. He is too ethical. He has been too severely touched. And,\nas usual, he is unpractical. He is up in the air with all kinds of\nethical delusions and plans for mission work among the cultured. He\nfeels it is his bounden duty to resurrect the ancient spirit of the\nChurch and to deliver its message to the masters. He is overwrought.\nSooner or later he is going to break out, and then there's going to be\na smash-up. What form it will take I can't even guess. He is a pure,\nexalted soul, but he is so unpractical. He's beyond me. I can't keep\nhis feet on the earth. And through the air he is rushing on to his\nGethsemane. And after this his crucifixion. Such high souls are made for\ncrucifixion.\"\n\n\"And you?\" I asked; and beneath my smile was the seriousness of the\nanxiety of love.\n\n\"Not I,\" he laughed back. \"I may be executed, or assassinated, but I\nshall never be crucified. I am planted too solidly and stolidly upon the\nearth.\"\n\n\"But why should you bring about the crucifixion of the Bishop?\" I asked.\n\"You will not deny that you are the cause of it.\"\n\n\"Why should I leave one comfortable soul in comfort when there are\nmillions in travail and misery?\" he demanded back.\n\n\"Then why did you advise father to accept the vacation?\"\n\n\"Because I am not a pure, exalted soul,\" was the answer. \"Because I am\nsolid and stolid and selfish. Because I love you and, like Ruth of\nold, thy people are my people. As for the Bishop, he has no daughter.\nBesides, no matter how small the good, nevertheless his little\ninadequate wail will be productive of some good in the revolution, and\nevery little bit counts.\"\n\nI could not agree with Ernest. I knew well the noble nature of\nBishop Morehouse, and I could not conceive that his voice raised for\nrighteousness would be no more than a little inadequate wail. But I did\nnot yet have the harsh facts of life at my fingers' ends as Ernest had.\nHe saw clearly the futility of the Bishop's great soul, as coming events\nwere soon to show as clearly to me.\n\nIt was shortly after this day that Ernest told me, as a good story, the\noffer he had received from the government, namely, an appointment as\nUnited States Commissioner of Labor. I was overjoyed. The salary was\ncomparatively large, and would make safe our marriage. And then it\nsurely was congenial work for Ernest, and, furthermore, my jealous pride\nin him made me hail the proffered appointment as a recognition of his\nabilities.\n\nThen I noticed the twinkle in his eyes. He was laughing at me.\n\n\"You are not going to . . . to decline?\" I quavered.\n\n\"It is a bribe,\" he said. \"Behind it is the fine hand of Wickson, and\nbehind him the hands of greater men than he. It is an old trick, old as\nthe class struggle is old--stealing the captains from the army of labor.\nPoor betrayed labor! If you but knew how many of its leaders have been\nbought out in similar ways in the past. It is cheaper, so much cheaper,\nto buy a general than to fight him and his whole army. There was--but\nI'll not call any names. I'm bitter enough over it as it is. Dear heart,\nI am a captain of labor. I could not sell out. If for no other reason,\nthe memory of my poor old father and the way he was worked to death\nwould prevent.\"\n\nThe tears were in his eyes, this great, strong hero of mine. He never\ncould forgive the way his father had been malformed--the sordid lies and\nthe petty thefts he had been compelled to, in order to put food in his\nchildren's mouths.\n\n\"My father was a good man,\" Ernest once said to me. \"The soul of him was\ngood, and yet it was twisted, and maimed, and blunted by the savagery\nof his life. He was made into a broken-down beast by his masters, the\narch-beasts. He should be alive to-day, like your father. He had a\nstrong constitution. But he was caught in the machine and worked to\ndeath--for profit. Think of it. For profit--his life blood transmuted\ninto a wine-supper, or a jewelled gewgaw, or some similar sense-orgy of\nthe parasitic and idle rich, his masters, the arch-beasts.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE BISHOP'S VISION\n\n\n\"The Bishop is out of hand,\" Ernest wrote me. \"He is clear up in the\nair. Tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very miserable\nworld of ours. He is going to deliver his message. He has told me so,\nand I cannot dissuade him. To-night he is chairman of the I.P.H.,* and\nhe will embody his message in his introductory remarks.\n\n     * There is no clew to the name of the organization for which\n     these initials stand.\n\n\"May I bring you to hear him? Of course, he is foredoomed to futility.\nIt will break your heart--it will break his; but for you it will be an\nexcellent object lesson. You know, dear heart, how proud I am because\nyou love me. And because of that I want you to know my fullest value, I\nwant to redeem, in your eyes, some small measure of my unworthiness.\nAnd so it is that my pride desires that you shall know my thinking is\ncorrect and right. My views are harsh; the futility of so noble a soul\nas the Bishop will show you the compulsion for such harshness. So come\nto-night. Sad though this night's happening will be, I feel that it will\nbut draw you more closely to me.\"\n\nThe I.P.H. held its convention that night in San Francisco.* This\nconvention had been called to consider public immorality and the remedy\nfor it. Bishop Morehouse presided. He was very nervous as he sat on the\nplatform, and I could see the high tension he was under. By his side\nwere Bishop Dickinson; H. H. Jones, the head of the ethical department\nin the University of California; Mrs. W. W. Hurd, the great charity\norganizer; Philip Ward, the equally great philanthropist; and several\nlesser luminaries in the field of morality and charity. Bishop Morehouse\narose and abruptly began:\n\n     * It took but a few minutes to cross by ferry from Berkeley\n     to San Francisco.  These, and the other bay cities,\n     practically composed one community.\n\n\"I was in my brougham, driving through the streets. It was night-time.\nNow and then I looked through the carriage windows, and suddenly my eyes\nseemed to be opened, and I saw things as they really are. At first I\ncovered my eyes with my hands to shut out the awful sight, and then, in\nthe darkness, the question came to me: What is to be done? What is to be\ndone? A little later the question came to me in another way: What would\nthe Master do? And with the question a great light seemed to fill\nthe place, and I saw my duty sun-clear, as Saul saw his on the way to\nDamascus.\n\n\"I stopped the carriage, got out, and, after a few minutes'\nconversation, persuaded two of the public women to get into the brougham\nwith me. If Jesus was right, then these two unfortunates were my\nsisters, and the only hope of their purification was in my affection and\ntenderness.\n\n\"I live in one of the loveliest localities of San Francisco. The house\nin which I live cost a hundred thousand dollars, and its furnishings,\nbooks, and works of art cost as much more. The house is a mansion.\nNo, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants. I never knew what\npalaces were good for. I had thought they were to live in. But now I\nknow. I took the two women of the street to my palace, and they are\ngoing to stay with me. I hope to fill every room in my palace with such\nsisters as they.\"\n\nThe audience had been growing more and more restless and unsettled, and\nthe faces of those that sat on the platform had been betraying greater\nand greater dismay and consternation. And at this point Bishop Dickinson\narose, and with an expression of disgust on his face, fled from the\nplatform and the hall. But Bishop Morehouse, oblivious to all, his eyes\nfilled with his vision, continued:\n\n\"Oh, sisters and brothers, in this act of mine I find the solution of\nall my difficulties. I didn't know what broughams were made for, but now\nI know. They are made to carry the weak, the sick, and the aged; they\nare made to show honor to those who have lost the sense even of shame.\n\n\"I did not know what palaces were made for, but now I have found a use\nfor them. The palaces of the Church should be hospitals and nurseries\nfor those who have fallen by the wayside and are perishing.\"\n\nHe made a long pause, plainly overcome by the thought that was in him,\nand nervous how best to express it.\n\n\"I am not fit, dear brethren, to tell you anything about morality. I\nhave lived in shame and hypocrisies too long to be able to help others;\nbut my action with those women, sisters of mine, shows me that the\nbetter way is easy to find. To those who believe in Jesus and his gospel\nthere can be no other relation between man and man than the relation\nof affection. Love alone is stronger than sin--stronger than death. I\ntherefore say to the rich among you that it is their duty to do what I\nhave done and am doing. Let each one of you who is prosperous take into\nhis house some thief and treat him as his brother, some unfortunate and\ntreat her as his sister, and San Francisco will need no police force\nand no magistrates; the prisons will be turned into hospitals, and the\ncriminal will disappear with his crime.\n\n\"We must give ourselves and not our money alone. We must do as Christ\ndid; that is the message of the Church today. We have wandered far from\nthe Master's teaching. We are consumed in our own flesh-pots. We have\nput mammon in the place of Christ. I have here a poem that tells the\nwhole story. I should like to read it to you. It was written by an\nerring soul who yet saw clearly.* It must not be mistaken for an attack\nupon the Catholic Church. It is an attack upon all churches, upon the\npomp and splendor of all churches that have wandered from the Master's\npath and hedged themselves in from his lambs. Here it is:\n\n     \"The silver trumpets rang across the Dome;\n             The people knelt upon the ground with awe;\n             And borne upon the necks of men I saw,\n     Like some great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.\n\n     \"Priest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,\n             And, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,\n             Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head;\n     In splendor and in light the Pope passed home.\n\n     \"My heart stole back across wide wastes of years\n             To One who wandered by a lonely sea;\n     And sought in vain for any place of rest:\n     'Foxes have holes, and every bird its nest,\n             I, only I, must wander wearily,\n     And bruise my feet, and drink wine salt with tears.'\"\n\n     * Oscar Wilde, one of the lords of language of the\n     nineteenth century of the Christian Era.\n\nThe audience was agitated, but unresponsive. Yet Bishop Morehouse was\nnot aware of it. He held steadily on his way.\n\n\"And so I say to the rich among you, and to all the rich, that bitterly\nyou oppress the Master's lambs. You have hardened your hearts. You have\nclosed your ears to the voices that are crying in the land--the voices\nof pain and sorrow that you will not hear but that some day will be\nheard. And so I say--\"\n\nBut at this point H. H. Jones and Philip Ward, who had already risen\nfrom their chairs, led the Bishop off the platform, while the audience\nsat breathless and shocked.\n\nErnest laughed harshly and savagely when he had gained the street. His\nlaughter jarred upon me. My heart seemed ready to burst with suppressed\ntears.\n\n\"He has delivered his message,\" Ernest cried. \"The manhood and the\ndeep-hidden, tender nature of their Bishop burst out, and his Christian\naudience, that loved him, concluded that he was crazy! Did you see them\nleading him so solicitously from the platform? There must have been\nlaughter in hell at the spectacle.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, it will make a great impression, what the Bishop did and\nsaid to-night,\" I said.\n\n\"Think so?\" Ernest queried mockingly.\n\n\"It will make a sensation,\" I asserted. \"Didn't you see the reporters\nscribbling like mad while he was speaking?\"\n\n\"Not a line of which will appear in to-morrow's papers.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" I cried.\n\n\"Just wait and see,\" was the answer. \"Not a line, not a thought that he\nuttered. The daily press? The daily suppressage!\"\n\n\"But the reporters,\" I objected. \"I saw them.\"\n\n\"Not a word that he uttered will see print. You have forgotten the\neditors. They draw their salaries for the policy they maintain. Their\npolicy is to print nothing that is a vital menace to the established.\nThe Bishop's utterance was a violent assault upon the established\nmorality. It was heresy. They led him from the platform to prevent him\nfrom uttering more heresy. The newspapers will purge his heresy in the\noblivion of silence. The press of the United States? It is a parasitic\ngrowth that battens on the capitalist class. Its function is to serve\nthe established by moulding public opinion, and right well it serves it.\n\n\"Let me prophesy. To-morrow's papers will merely mention that the Bishop\nis in poor health, that he has been working too hard, and that he broke\ndown last night. The next mention, some days hence, will be to the\neffect that he is suffering from nervous prostration and has been given\na vacation by his grateful flock. After that, one of two things will\nhappen: either the Bishop will see the error of his way and return from\nhis vacation a well man in whose eyes there are no more visions, or else\nhe will persist in his madness, and then you may expect to see in the\npapers, couched pathetically and tenderly, the announcement of his\ninsanity. After that he will be left to gibber his visions to padded\nwalls.\"\n\n\"Now there you go too far!\" I cried out.\n\n\"In the eyes of society it will truly be insanity,\" he replied. \"What\nhonest man, who is not insane, would take lost women and thieves into\nhis house to dwell with him sisterly and brotherly? True, Christ died\nbetween two thieves, but that is another story. Insanity? The mental\nprocesses of the man with whom one disagrees, are always wrong.\nTherefore the mind of the man is wrong. Where is the line between\nwrong mind and insane mind? It is inconceivable that any sane man can\nradically disagree with one's most sane conclusions.\n\n\"There is a good example of it in this evening's paper. Mary McKenna\nlives south of Market Street. She is a poor but honest woman. She is\nalso patriotic. But she has erroneous ideas concerning the American flag\nand the protection it is supposed to symbolize. And here's what happened\nto her. Her husband had an accident and was laid up in hospital three\nmonths. In spite of taking in washing, she got behind in her rent.\nYesterday they evicted her. But first, she hoisted an American flag, and\nfrom under its folds she announced that by virtue of its protection they\ncould not turn her out on to the cold street. What was done? She was\narrested and arraigned for insanity. To-day she was examined by the\nregular insanity experts. She was found insane. She was consigned to the\nNapa Asylum.\"\n\n\"But that is far-fetched,\" I objected. \"Suppose I should disagree with\neverybody about the literary style of a book. They wouldn't send me to\nan asylum for that.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" he replied. \"But such divergence of opinion would\nconstitute no menace to society. Therein lies the difference. The\ndivergence of opinion on the parts of Mary McKenna and the Bishop do\nmenace society. What if all the poor people should refuse to pay rent\nand shelter themselves under the American flag? Landlordism would go\ncrumbling. The Bishop's views are just as perilous to society. Ergo, to\nthe asylum with him.\"\n\nBut still I refused to believe.\n\n\"Wait and see,\" Ernest said, and I waited.\n\nNext morning I sent out for all the papers. So far Ernest was right. Not\na word that Bishop Morehouse had uttered was in print. Mention was made\nin one or two of the papers that he had been overcome by his feelings.\nYet the platitudes of the speakers that followed him were reported at\nlength.\n\nSeveral days later the brief announcement was made that he had gone away\non a vacation to recover from the effects of overwork. So far so good,\nbut there had been no hint of insanity, nor even of nervous collapse.\nLittle did I dream the terrible road the Bishop was destined to\ntravel--the Gethsemane and crucifixion that Ernest had pondered about.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE MACHINE BREAKERS\n\n\nIt was just before Ernest ran for Congress, on the socialist ticket,\nthat father gave what he privately called his \"Profit and Loss\" dinner.\nErnest called it the dinner of the Machine Breakers. In point of fact,\nit was merely a dinner for business men--small business men, of\ncourse. I doubt if one of them was interested in any business the total\ncapitalization of which exceeded a couple of hundred thousand dollars.\nThey were truly representative middle-class business men.\n\nThere was Owen, of Silverberg, Owen & Company--a large grocery firm with\nseveral branch stores. We bought our groceries from them. There were\nboth partners of the big drug firm of Kowalt & Washburn, and Mr.\nAsmunsen, the owner of a large granite quarry in Contra Costa County.\nAnd there were many similar men, owners or part-owners in small\nfactories, small businesses and small industries--small capitalists, in\nshort.\n\nThey were shrewd-faced, interesting men, and they talked with simplicity\nand clearness. Their unanimous complaint was against the corporations\nand trusts. Their creed was, \"Bust the Trusts.\" All oppression\noriginated in the trusts, and one and all told the same tale of woe.\nThey advocated government ownership of such trusts as the railroads\nand telegraphs, and excessive income taxes, graduated with ferocity,\nto destroy large accumulations. Likewise they advocated, as a cure for\nlocal ills, municipal ownership of such public utilities as water, gas,\ntelephones, and street railways.\n\nEspecially interesting was Mr. Asmunsen's narrative of his tribulations\nas a quarry owner. He confessed that he never made any profits out of\nhis quarry, and this, in spite of the enormous volume of business\nthat had been caused by the destruction of San Francisco by the big\nearthquake. For six years the rebuilding of San Francisco had been going\non, and his business had quadrupled and octupled, and yet he was no\nbetter off.\n\n\"The railroad knows my business just a little bit better than I do,\" he\nsaid. \"It knows my operating expenses to a cent, and it knows the terms\nof my contracts. How it knows these things I can only guess. It must\nhave spies in my employ, and it must have access to the parties to all\nmy contracts. For look you, when I place a big contract, the terms\nof which favor me a goodly profit, the freight rate from my quarry to\nmarket is promptly raised. No explanation is made. The railroad gets my\nprofit. Under such circumstances I have never succeeded in getting the\nrailroad to reconsider its raise. On the other hand, when there have\nbeen accidents, increased expenses of operating, or contracts with less\nprofitable terms, I have always succeeded in getting the railroad to\nlower its rate. What is the result? Large or small, the railroad always\ngets my profits.\"\n\n\"What remains to you over and above,\" Ernest interrupted to ask, \"would\nroughly be the equivalent of your salary as a manager did the railroad\nown the quarry.\"\n\n\"The very thing,\" Mr. Asmunsen replied. \"Only a short time ago I had my\nbooks gone through for the past ten years. I discovered that for\nthose ten years my gain was just equivalent to a manager's salary. The\nrailroad might just as well have owned my quarry and hired me to run\nit.\"\n\n\"But with this difference,\" Ernest laughed; \"the railroad would have had\nto assume all the risk which you so obligingly assumed for it.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" Mr. Asmunsen answered sadly.\n\nHaving let them have their say, Ernest began asking questions right and\nleft. He began with Mr. Owen.\n\n\"You started a branch store here in Berkeley about six months ago?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Owen answered.\n\n\"And since then I've noticed that three little corner groceries have\ngone out of business. Was your branch store the cause of it?\"\n\nMr. Owen affirmed with a complacent smile. \"They had no chance against\nus.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"We had greater capital. With a large business there is always less\nwaste and greater efficiency.\"\n\n\"And your branch store absorbed the profits of the three small ones. I\nsee. But tell me, what became of the owners of the three stores?\"\n\n\"One is driving a delivery wagon for us. I don't know what happened to\nthe other two.\"\n\nErnest turned abruptly on Mr. Kowalt.\n\n\"You sell a great deal at cut-rates.* What have become of the owners of\nthe small drug stores that you forced to the wall?\"\n\n     * A lowering of selling price to cost, and even to less than\n     cost. Thus, a large company could sell at a loss for a\n     longer period than a small company, and so drive the small\n     company out of business.  A common device of competition.\n\n\"One of them, Mr. Haasfurther, has charge now of our prescription\ndepartment,\" was the answer.\n\n\"And you absorbed the profits they had been making?\"\n\n\"Surely. That is what we are in business for.\"\n\n\"And you?\" Ernest said suddenly to Mr. Asmunsen. \"You are disgusted\nbecause the railroad has absorbed your profits?\"\n\nMr. Asmunsen nodded.\n\n\"What you want is to make profits yourself?\"\n\nAgain Mr. Asmunsen nodded.\n\n\"Out of others?\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"Out of others?\" Ernest insisted.\n\n\"That is the way profits are made,\" Mr. Asmunsen replied curtly.\n\n\"Then the business game is to make profits out of others, and to prevent\nothers from making profits out of you. That's it, isn't it?\"\n\nErnest had to repeat his question before Mr. Asmunsen gave an answer,\nand then he said:\n\n\"Yes, that's it, except that we do not object to the others making\nprofits so long as they are not extortionate.\"\n\n\"By extortionate you mean large; yet you do not object to making large\nprofits yourself? . . . Surely not?\"\n\nAnd Mr. Asmunsen amiably confessed to the weakness. There was one other\nman who was quizzed by Ernest at this juncture, a Mr. Calvin, who had\nonce been a great dairy-owner.\n\n\"Some time ago you were fighting the Milk Trust,\" Ernest said to him;\n\"and now you are in Grange politics.* How did it happen?\"\n\n     * Many efforts were made during this period to organize the\n     perishing farmer class into a political party, the aim of\n     which was destroy the trusts and corporations by drastic\n     legislation.  All such attempts ended in failure.\n\n\"Oh, I haven't quit the fight,\" Mr. Calvin answered, and he looked\nbelligerent enough. \"I'm fighting the Trust on the only field where it\nis possible to fight--the political field. Let me show you. A few years\nago we dairymen had everything our own way.\"\n\n\"But you competed among yourselves?\" Ernest interrupted.\n\n\"Yes, that was what kept the profits down. We did try to organize, but\nindependent dairymen always broke through us. Then came the Milk Trust.\"\n\n\"Financed by surplus capital from Standard Oil,\"* Ernest said.\n\n     * The first successful great trust--almost a generation in\n     advance of the rest.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Calvin acknowledged. \"But we did not know it at the time.\nIts agents approached us with a club. \"Come in and be fat,\" was their\nproposition, \"or stay out and starve.\" Most of us came in. Those that\ndidn't, starved. Oh, it paid us . . . at first. Milk was raised a cent a\nquart. One-quarter of this cent came to us. Three-quarters of it went to\nthe Trust. Then milk was raised another cent, only we didn't get any\nof that cent. Our complaints were useless. The Trust was in control. We\ndiscovered that we were pawns. Finally, the additional quarter of a cent\nwas denied us. Then the Trust began to squeeze us out. What could we do?\nWe were squeezed out. There were no dairymen, only a Milk Trust.\"\n\n\"But with milk two cents higher, I should think you could have\ncompeted,\" Ernest suggested slyly.\n\n\"So we thought. We tried it.\" Mr. Calvin paused a moment. \"It broke us.\nThe Trust could put milk upon the market more cheaply than we. It could\nsell still at a slight profit when we were selling at actual loss.\nI dropped fifty thousand dollars in that venture. Most of us went\nbankrupt.* The dairymen were wiped out of existence.\"\n\n     * Bankruptcy--a peculiar institution that enabled an\n     individual, who had failed in competitive industry, to\n     forego paying his debts. The effect was to ameliorate the\n     too savage conditions of the fang-and-claw social struggle.\n\n\"So the Trust took your profits away from you,\" Ernest said, \"and you've\ngone into politics in order to legislate the Trust out of existence and\nget the profits back?\"\n\nMr. Calvin's face lighted up. \"That is precisely what I say in my\nspeeches to the farmers. That's our whole idea in a nutshell.\"\n\n\"And yet the Trust produces milk more cheaply than could the independent\ndairymen?\" Ernest queried.\n\n\"Why shouldn't it, with the splendid organization and new machinery its\nlarge capital makes possible?\"\n\n\"There is no discussion,\" Ernest answered. \"It certainly should, and,\nfurthermore, it does.\"\n\nMr. Calvin here launched out into a political speech in exposition of\nhis views. He was warmly followed by a number of the others, and the cry\nof all was to destroy the trusts.\n\n\"Poor simple folk,\" Ernest said to me in an undertone. \"They see clearly\nas far as they see, but they see only to the ends of their noses.\"\n\nA little later he got the floor again, and in his characteristic way\ncontrolled it for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"I have listened carefully to all of you,\" he began, \"and I see plainly\nthat you play the business game in the orthodox fashion. Life sums\nitself up to you in profits. You have a firm and abiding belief that\nyou were created for the sole purpose of making profits. Only there is a\nhitch. In the midst of your own profit-making along comes the trust\nand takes your profits away from you. This is a dilemma that interferes\nsomehow with the aim of creation, and the only way out, as it seems to\nyou, is to destroy that which takes from you your profits.\n\n\"I have listened carefully, and there is only one name that will\nepitomize you. I shall call you that name. You are machine-breakers. Do\nyou know what a machine-breaker is? Let me tell you. In the eighteenth\ncentury, in England, men and women wove cloth on hand-looms in their own\ncottages. It was a slow, clumsy, and costly way of weaving cloth,\nthis cottage system of manufacture. Along came the steam-engine and\nlabor-saving machinery. A thousand looms assembled in a large factory,\nand driven by a central engine wove cloth vastly more cheaply than\ncould the cottage weavers on their hand-looms. Here in the factory was\ncombination, and before it competition faded away. The men and women who\nhad worked the hand-looms for themselves now went into the factories\nand worked the machine-looms, not for themselves, but for the capitalist\nowners. Furthermore, little children went to work on the machine-looms,\nat lower wages, and displaced the men. This made hard times for the men.\nTheir standard of living fell. They starved. And they said it was\nall the fault of the machines. Therefore, they proceeded to break the\nmachines. They did not succeed, and they were very stupid.\n\n\"Yet you have not learned their lesson. Here are you, a century and a\nhalf later, trying to break machines. By your own confession the trust\nmachines do the work more efficiently and more cheaply than you can.\nThat is why you cannot compete with them. And yet you would break those\nmachines. You are even more stupid than the stupid workmen of England.\nAnd while you maunder about restoring competition, the trusts go on\ndestroying you.\n\n\"One and all you tell the same story,--the passing away of competition\nand the coming on of combination. You, Mr. Owen, destroyed competition\nhere in Berkeley when your branch store drove the three small groceries\nout of business. Your combination was more effective. Yet you feel the\npressure of other combinations on you, the trust combinations, and you\ncry out. It is because you are not a trust. If you were a grocery trust\nfor the whole United States, you would be singing another song. And the\nsong would be, 'Blessed are the trusts.' And yet again, not only is your\nsmall combination not a trust, but you are aware yourself of its lack\nof strength. You are beginning to divine your own end. You feel\nyourself and your branch stores a pawn in the game. You see the powerful\ninterests rising and growing more powerful day by day; you feel their\nmailed hands descending upon your profits and taking a pinch here and\na pinch there--the railroad trust, the oil trust, the steel trust, the\ncoal trust; and you know that in the end they will destroy you, take\naway from you the last per cent of your little profits.\n\n\"You, sir, are a poor gamester. When you squeezed out the three small\ngroceries here in Berkeley by virtue of your superior combination, you\nswelled out your chest, talked about efficiency and enterprise, and sent\nyour wife to Europe on the profits you had gained by eating up the three\nsmall groceries. It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up. But, on the\nother hand, you are being eaten up in turn by the bigger dogs, wherefore\nyou squeal. And what I say to you is true of all of you at this table.\nYou are all squealing. You are all playing the losing game, and you are\nall squealing about it.\n\n\"But when you squeal you don't state the situation flatly, as I have\nstated it. You don't say that you like to squeeze profits out of others,\nand that you are making all the row because others are squeezing your\nprofits out of you. No, you are too cunning for that. You say something\nelse. You make small-capitalist political speeches such as Mr. Calvin\nmade. What did he say? Here are a few of his phrases I caught: 'Our\noriginal principles are all right,' 'What this country requires is a\nreturn to fundamental American methods--free opportunity for all,' 'The\nspirit of liberty in which this nation was born,' 'Let us return to the\nprinciples of our forefathers.'\n\n\"When he says 'free opportunity for all,' he means free opportunity to\nsqueeze profits, which freedom of opportunity is now denied him by the\ngreat trusts. And the absurd thing about it is that you have repeated\nthese phrases so often that you believe them. You want opportunity\nto plunder your fellow-men in your own small way, but you hypnotize\nyourselves into thinking you want freedom. You are piggish and\nacquisitive, but the magic of your phrases leads you to believe that you\nare patriotic. Your desire for profits, which is sheer selfishness, you\nmetamorphose into altruistic solicitude for suffering humanity. Come\non now, right here amongst ourselves, and be honest for once. Look the\nmatter in the face and state it in direct terms.\"\n\nThere were flushed and angry faces at the table, and withal a measure\nof awe. They were a little frightened at this smooth-faced young fellow,\nand the swing and smash of his words, and his dreadful trait of calling\na spade a spade. Mr. Calvin promptly replied.\n\n\"And why not?\" he demanded. \"Why can we not return to ways of our\nfathers when this republic was founded? You have spoken much truth, Mr.\nEverhard, unpalatable though it has been. But here amongst ourselves let\nus speak out. Let us throw off all disguise and accept the truth as Mr.\nEverhard has flatly stated it. It is true that we smaller capitalists\nare after profits, and that the trusts are taking our profits away from\nus. It is true that we want to destroy the trusts in order that our\nprofits may remain to us. And why can we not do it? Why not? I say, why\nnot?\"\n\n\"Ah, now we come to the gist of the matter,\" Ernest said with a pleased\nexpression. \"I'll try to tell you why not, though the telling will be\nrather hard. You see, you fellows have studied business, in a small way,\nbut you have not studied social evolution at all. You are in the\nmidst of a transition stage now in economic evolution, but you do not\nunderstand it, and that's what causes all the confusion. Why cannot you\nreturn? Because you can't. You can no more make water run up hill than\ncan you cause the tide of economic evolution to flow back in its channel\nalong the way it came. Joshua made the sun stand still upon Gibeon, but\nyou would outdo Joshua. You would make the sun go backward in the sky.\nYou would have time retrace its steps from noon to morning.\n\n\"In the face of labor-saving machinery, of organized production, of the\nincreased efficiency of combination, you would set the economic sun\nback a whole generation or so to the time when there were no great\ncapitalists, no great machinery, no railroads--a time when a host of\nlittle capitalists warred with each other in economic anarchy, and when\nproduction was primitive, wasteful, unorganized, and costly. Believe me,\nJoshua's task was easier, and he had Jehovah to help him. But God has\nforsaken you small capitalists. The sun of the small capitalists is\nsetting. It will never rise again. Nor is it in your power even to make\nit stand still. You are perishing, and you are doomed to perish utterly\nfrom the face of society.\n\n\"This is the fiat of evolution. It is the word of God. Combination is\nstronger than competition. Primitive man was a puny creature hiding in\nthe crevices of the rocks. He combined and made war upon his carnivorous\nenemies. They were competitive beasts. Primitive man was a combinative\nbeast, and because of it he rose to primacy over all the animals. And\nman has been achieving greater and greater combinations ever since. It\nis combination versus competition, a thousand centuries long struggle,\nin which competition has always been worsted. Whoso enlists on the side\nof competition perishes.\"\n\n\"But the trusts themselves arose out of competition,\" Mr. Calvin\ninterrupted.\n\n\"Very true,\" Ernest answered. \"And the trusts themselves destroyed\ncompetition. That, by your own word, is why you are no longer in the\ndairy business.\"\n\nThe first laughter of the evening went around the table, and even Mr.\nCalvin joined in the laugh against himself.\n\n\"And now, while we are on the trusts,\" Ernest went on, \"let us settle\na few things. I shall make certain statements, and if you disagree\nwith them, speak up. Silence will mean agreement. Is it not true that\na machine-loom will weave more cloth and weave more cheaply than a\nhand-loom?\" He paused, but nobody spoke up. \"Is it not then highly\nirrational to break the machine-loom and go back to the clumsy and more\ncostly hand-loom method of weaving?\" Heads nodded in acquiescence. \"Is\nit not true that that known as a trust produces more efficiently and\ncheaply than can a thousand competing small concerns?\" Still no one\nobjected. \"Then is it not irrational to destroy that cheap and efficient\ncombination?\"\n\nNo one answered for a long time. Then Mr. Kowalt spoke.\n\n\"What are we to do, then?\" he demanded. \"To destroy the trusts is the\nonly way we can see to escape their domination.\"\n\nErnest was all fire and aliveness on the instant.\n\n\"I'll show you another way!\" he cried. \"Let us not destroy those\nwonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply. Let us control\nthem. Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness. Let us run them\nfor ourselves. Let us oust the present owners of the wonderful machines,\nand let us own the wonderful machines ourselves. That, gentlemen, is\nsocialism, a greater combination than the trusts, a greater economic and\nsocial combination than any that has as yet appeared on the planet. It\nis in line with evolution. We meet combination with greater combination.\nIt is the winning side. Come on over with us socialists and play on the\nwinning side.\"\n\nHere arose dissent. There was a shaking of heads, and mutterings arose.\n\n\"All right, then, you prefer to be anachronisms,\" Ernest laughed. \"You\nprefer to play atavistic roles. You are doomed to perish as all atavisms\nperish. Have you ever asked what will happen to you when greater\ncombinations than even the present trusts arise? Have you ever\nconsidered where you will stand when the great trusts themselves combine\ninto the combination of combinations--into the social, economic, and\npolitical trust?\"\n\nHe turned abruptly and irrelevantly upon Mr. Calvin.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Ernest said, \"if this is not true. You are compelled to form\na new political party because the old parties are in the hands of the\ntrusts. The chief obstacle to your Grange propaganda is the trusts.\nBehind every obstacle you encounter, every blow that smites you, every\ndefeat that you receive, is the hand of the trusts. Is this not so? Tell\nme.\"\n\nMr. Calvin sat in uncomfortable silence.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Ernest encouraged.\n\n\"It is true,\" Mr. Calvin confessed. \"We captured the state legislature\nof Oregon and put through splendid protective legislation, and it was\nvetoed by the governor, who was a creature of the trusts. We elected a\ngovernor of Colorado, and the legislature refused to permit him to take\noffice. Twice we have passed a national income tax, and each time the\nsupreme court smashed it as unconstitutional. The courts are in the\nhands of the trusts. We, the people, do not pay our judges sufficiently.\nBut there will come a time--\"\n\n\"When the combination of the trusts will control all legislation, when\nthe combination of the trusts will itself be the government,\" Ernest\ninterrupted.\n\n\"Never! never!\" were the cries that arose. Everybody was excited and\nbelligerent.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Ernest demanded, \"what will you do when such a time comes?\"\n\n\"We will rise in our strength!\" Mr. Asmunsen cried, and many voices\nbacked his decision.\n\n\"That will be civil war,\" Ernest warned them.\n\n\"So be it, civil war,\" was Mr. Asmunsen's answer, with the cries of all\nthe men at the table behind him. \"We have not forgotten the deeds of our\nforefathers. For our liberties we are ready to fight and die.\"\n\nErnest smiled.\n\n\"Do not forget,\" he said, \"that we had tacitly agreed that liberty in\nyour case, gentlemen, means liberty to squeeze profits out of others.\"\n\nThe table was angry, now, fighting angry; but Ernest controlled the\ntumult and made himself heard.\n\n\"One more question. When you rise in your strength, remember, the reason\nfor your rising will be that the government is in the hands of the\ntrusts. Therefore, against your strength the government will turn the\nregular army, the navy, the militia, the police--in short, the whole\norganized war machinery of the United States. Where will your strength\nbe then?\"\n\nDismay sat on their faces, and before they could recover, Ernest struck\nagain.\n\n\"Do you remember, not so long ago, when our regular army was only fifty\nthousand? Year by year it has been increased until to-day it is three\nhundred thousand.\"\n\nAgain he struck.\n\n\"Nor is that all. While you diligently pursued that favorite phantom\nof yours, called profits, and moralized about that favorite fetich of\nyours, called competition, even greater and more direful things have\nbeen accomplished by combination. There is the militia.\"\n\n\"It is our strength!\" cried Mr. Kowalt. \"With it we would repel the\ninvasion of the regular army.\"\n\n\"You would go into the militia yourself,\" was Ernest's retort, \"and\nbe sent to Maine, or Florida, or the Philippines, or anywhere else,\nto drown in blood your own comrades civil-warring for their liberties.\nWhile from Kansas, or Wisconsin, or any other state, your own comrades\nwould go into the militia and come here to California to drown in blood\nyour own civil-warring.\"\n\nNow they were really shocked, and they sat wordless, until Mr. Owen\nmurmured:\n\n\"We would not go into the militia. That would settle it. We would not be\nso foolish.\"\n\nErnest laughed outright.\n\n\"You do not understand the combination that has been effected. You could\nnot help yourself. You would be drafted into the militia.\"\n\n\"There is such a thing as civil law,\" Mr. Owen insisted.\n\n\"Not when the government suspends civil law. In that day when you\nspeak of rising in your strength, your strength would be turned against\nyourself. Into the militia you would go, willy-nilly. Habeas corpus, I\nheard some one mutter just now. Instead of habeas corpus you would get\npost mortems. If you refused to go into the militia, or to obey after\nyou were in, you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down\nlike dogs. It is the law.\"\n\n\"It is not the law!\" Mr. Calvin asserted positively. \"There is no such\nlaw. Young man, you have dreamed all this. Why, you spoke of sending the\nmilitia to the Philippines. That is unconstitutional. The Constitution\nespecially states that the militia cannot be sent out of the country.\"\n\n\"What's the Constitution got to do with it?\" Ernest demanded. \"The\ncourts interpret the Constitution, and the courts, as Mr. Asmunsen\nagreed, are the creatures of the trusts. Besides, it is as I have said,\nthe law. It has been the law for years, for nine years, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"That we can be drafted into the militia?\" Mr. Calvin asked\nincredulously. \"That they can shoot us by drumhead court martial if we\nrefuse?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ernest answered, \"precisely that.\"\n\n\"How is it that we have never heard of this law?\" my father asked, and I\ncould see that it was likewise new to him.\n\n\"For two reasons,\" Ernest said. \"First, there has been no need to\nenforce it. If there had, you'd have heard of it soon enough. And\nsecondly, the law was rushed through Congress and the Senate secretly,\nwith practically no discussion. Of course, the newspapers made no\nmention of it. But we socialists knew about it. We published it in our\npapers. But you never read our papers.\"\n\n\"I still insist you are dreaming,\" Mr. Calvin said stubbornly. \"The\ncountry would never have permitted it.\"\n\n\"But the country did permit it,\" Ernest replied. \"And as for my\ndreaming--\" he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small\npamphlet--\"tell me if this looks like dream-stuff.\"\n\nHe opened it and began to read:\n\n\"'Section One, be it enacted, and so forth and so forth, that the\nmilitia shall consist of every able-bodied male citizen of the\nrespective states, territories, and District of Columbia, who is more\nthan eighteen and less than forty-five years of age.'\n\n\"'Section Seven, that any officer or enlisted man'--remember Section\nOne, gentlemen, you are all enlisted men--'that any enlisted man of the\nmilitia who shall refuse or neglect to present himself to such mustering\nofficer upon being called forth as herein prescribed, shall be subject\nto trial by court martial, and shall be punished as such court martial\nshall direct.'\n\n\"'Section Eight, that courts martial, for the trial of officers or men\nof the militia, shall be composed of militia officers only.'\n\n\"'Section Nine, that the militia, when called into the actual service\nof the United States, shall be subject to the same rules and articles of\nwar as the regular troops of the United States.'\n\n\"There you are gentlemen, American citizens, and fellow-militiamen. Nine\nyears ago we socialists thought that law was aimed against labor. But it\nwould seem that it was aimed against you, too. Congressman Wiley, in the\nbrief discussion that was permitted, said that the bill 'provided for\na reserve force to take the mob by the throat'--you're the mob,\ngentlemen--'and protect at all hazards life, liberty, and property.' And\nin the time to come, when you rise in your strength, remember that you\nwill be rising against the property of the trusts, and the liberty of\nthe trusts, according to the law, to squeeze you. Your teeth are pulled,\ngentlemen. Your claws are trimmed. In the day you rise in your strength,\ntoothless and clawless, you will be as harmless as any army of clams.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" Kowalt cried. \"There is no such law. It is a\ncanard got up by you socialists.\"\n\n\"This bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on July 30,\n1902,\" was the reply. \"It was introduced by Representative Dick of\nOhio. It was rushed through. It was passed unanimously by the Senate\non January 14, 1903. And just seven days afterward was approved by the\nPresident of the United States.\"*\n\n     * Everhard was right in the essential particulars, though\n     his date of the introduction of the bill is in error.  The\n     bill was introduced on June 30, and not on July 30.  The\n     Congressional Record is here in Ardis, and a reference to it\n     shows mention of the bill on the following dates: June 30,\n     December 9, 15, 16, and 17, 1902, and January 7 and 14,\n     1903.  The ignorance evidenced by the business men at the\n     dinner was nothing unusual.  Very few people knew of the\n     existence of this law.  E.  Untermann, a revolutionist, in\n     July, 1903, published a pamphlet at Girard, Kansas, on the\n     \"Militia Bill.\"  This pamphlet had a small circulation among\n     workingmen; but already had the segregation of classes\n     proceeded so far, that the members of the middle class never\n     heard of the pamphlet at all, and so remained in ignorance\n     of the law.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF A DREAM\n\n\nIn the midst of the consternation his revelation had produced, Ernest\nbegan again to speak.\n\n\"You have said, a dozen of you to-night, that socialism is impossible.\nYou have asserted the impossible, now let me demonstrate the inevitable.\nNot only is it inevitable that you small capitalists shall pass away,\nbut it is inevitable that the large capitalists, and the trusts also,\nshall pass away. Remember, the tide of evolution never flows backward.\nIt flows on and on, and it flows from competition to combination, and\nfrom little combination to large combination, and from large combination\nto colossal combination, and it flows on to socialism, which is the most\ncolossal combination of all.\n\n\"You tell me that I dream. Very good. I'll give you the mathematics\nof my dream; and here, in advance, I challenge you to show that\nmy mathematics are wrong. I shall develop the inevitability of\nthe breakdown of the capitalist system, and I shall demonstrate\nmathematically why it must break down. Here goes, and bear with me if at\nfirst I seem irrelevant.\n\n\"Let us, first of all, investigate a particular industrial process, and\nwhenever I state something with which you disagree, please interrupt\nme. Here is a shoe factory. This factory takes leather and makes it into\nshoes. Here is one hundred dollars' worth of leather. It goes through\nthe factory and comes out in the form of shoes, worth, let us say, two\nhundred dollars. What has happened? One hundred dollars has been added\nto the value of the leather. How was it added? Let us see.\n\n\"Capital and labor added this value of one hundred dollars. Capital\nfurnished the factory, the machines, and paid all the expenses. Labor\nfurnished labor. By the joint effort of capital and labor one hundred\ndollars of value was added. Are you all agreed so far?\"\n\nHeads nodded around the table in affirmation.\n\n\"Labor and capital having produced this one hundred dollars, now proceed\nto divide it. The statistics of this division are fractional; so let\nus, for the sake of convenience, make them roughly approximate. Capital\ntakes fifty dollars as its share, and labor gets in wages fifty dollars\nas its share. We will not enter into the squabbling over the division.*\nNo matter how much squabbling takes place, in one percentage or another\nthe division is arranged. And take notice here, that what is true of\nthis particular industrial process is true of all industrial processes.\nAm I right?\"\n\n     * Everhard here clearly develops the cause of all the labor\n     troubles of that time.  In the division of the joint-product,\n     capital wanted all it could get, and labor wanted\n     all it could get. This quarrel over the division was\n     irreconcilable.  So long as the system of capitalistic\n     production existed, labor and capital continued to quarrel\n     over the division of the joint-product.  It is a ludicrous\n     spectacle to us, but we must not forget that we have seven\n     centuries' advantage over those that lived in that time.\n\nAgain the whole table agreed with Ernest.\n\n\"Now, suppose labor, having received its fifty dollars, wanted to buy\nback shoes. It could only buy back fifty dollars' worth. That's clear,\nisn't it?\n\n\"And now we shift from this particular process to the sum total of all\nindustrial processes in the United States, which includes the leather\nitself, raw material, transportation, selling, everything. We will say,\nfor the sake of round figures, that the total production of wealth in\nthe United States is one year is four billion dollars. Then labor has\nreceived in wages, during the same period, two billion dollars. Four\nbillion dollars has been produced. How much of this can labor buy\nback? Two billions. There is no discussion of this, I am sure. For that\nmatter, my percentages are mild. Because of a thousand capitalistic\ndevices, labor cannot buy back even half of the total product.\n\n\"But to return. We will say labor buys back two billions. Then it stands\nto reason that labor can consume only two billions. There are still two\nbillions to be accounted for, which labor cannot buy back and consume.\"\n\n\"Labor does not consume its two billions, even,\" Mr. Kowalt spoke up.\n\"If it did, it would not have any deposits in the savings banks.\"\n\n\"Labor's deposits in the savings banks are only a sort of reserve fund\nthat is consumed as fast as it accumulates. These deposits are saved\nfor old age, for sickness and accident, and for funeral expenses. The\nsavings bank deposit is simply a piece of the loaf put back on the shelf\nto be eaten next day. No, labor consumes all of the total product that\nits wages will buy back.\n\n\"Two billions are left to capital. After it has paid its expenses, does\nit consume the remainder? Does capital consume all of its two billions?\"\n\nErnest stopped and put the question point blank to a number of the men.\nThey shook their heads.\n\n\"I don't know,\" one of them frankly said.\n\n\"Of course you do,\" Ernest went on. \"Stop and think a moment. If capital\nconsumed its share, the sum total of capital could not increase. It\nwould remain constant. If you will look at the economic history of\nthe United States, you will see that the sum total of capital has\ncontinually increased. Therefore capital does not consume its share. Do\nyou remember when England owned so much of our railroad bonds? As the\nyears went by, we bought back those bonds. What does that mean? That\npart of capital's unconsumed share bought back the bonds. What is the\nmeaning of the fact that to-day the capitalists of the United States own\nhundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of Mexican bonds, Russian\nbonds, Italian bonds, Grecian bonds? The meaning is that those hundreds\nand hundreds of millions were part of capital's share which capital\ndid not consume. Furthermore, from the very beginning of the capitalist\nsystem, capital has never consumed all of its share.\n\n\"And now we come to the point. Four billion dollars of wealth is\nproduced in one year in the United States. Labor buys back and consumes\ntwo billions. Capital does not consume the remaining two billions. There\nis a large balance left over unconsumed. What is done with this balance?\nWhat can be done with it? Labor cannot consume any of it, for labor\nhas already spent all its wages. Capital will not consume this balance,\nbecause, already, according to its nature, it has consumed all it can.\nAnd still remains the balance. What can be done with it? What is done\nwith it?\"\n\n\"It is sold abroad,\" Mr. Kowalt volunteered.\n\n\"The very thing,\" Ernest agreed. \"Because of this balance arises our\nneed for a foreign market. This is sold abroad. It has to be sold\nabroad. There is no other way of getting rid of it. And that unconsumed\nsurplus, sold abroad, becomes what we call our favorable balance of\ntrade. Are we all agreed so far?\"\n\n\"Surely it is a waste of time to elaborate these A B C's of commerce,\"\nMr. Calvin said tartly. \"We all understand them.\"\n\n\"And it is by these A B C's I have so carefully elaborated that I shall\nconfound you,\" Ernest retorted. \"There's the beauty of it. And I'm going\nto confound you with them right now. Here goes.\n\n\"The United States is a capitalist country that has developed its\nresources. According to its capitalist system of industry, it has an\nunconsumed surplus that must be got rid of, and that must be got rid\nof abroad.* What is true of the United States is true of every other\ncapitalist country with developed resources. Every one of such countries\nhas an unconsumed surplus. Don't forget that they have already traded\nwith one another, and that these surpluses yet remain. Labor in all\nthese countries has spent its wages, and cannot buy any of the surpluses.\nCapital in all these countries has already consumed all it is able\naccording to its nature. And still remain the surpluses. They cannot\ndispose of these surpluses to one another. How are they going to get rid\nof them?\"\n\n     * Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States a few\n     years prior to this time, made the following public\n     declaration: \"A more liberal and extensive reciprocity in\n     the purchase and sale of commodities is necessary, so that\n     the overproduction of the United States can be\n     satisfactorily disposed of to foreign countries.\"  Of\n     course, this overproduction he mentions was the profits of\n     the capitalist system over and beyond the consuming power of\n     the capitalists.  It was at this time that Senator Mark\n     Hanna said: \"The production of wealth in the United States\n     is one-third larger annually than its consumption.\"  Also a\n     fellow-Senator, Chauncey Depew, said: \"The American people\n     produce annually two billions more wealth than they\n     consume.\"\n\n\"Sell them to countries with undeveloped resources,\" Mr. Kowalt\nsuggested.\n\n\"The very thing. You see, my argument is so clear and simple that\nin your own minds you carry it on for me. And now for the next step.\nSuppose the United States disposes of its surplus to a country with\nundeveloped resources like, say, Brazil. Remember this surplus is over\nand above trade, which articles of trade have been consumed. What, then,\ndoes the United States get in return from Brazil?\"\n\n\"Gold,\" said Mr. Kowalt.\n\n\"But there is only so much gold, and not much of it, in the world,\"\nErnest objected.\n\n\"Gold in the form of securities and bonds and so forth,\" Mr. Kowalt\namended.\n\n\"Now you've struck it,\" Ernest said. \"From Brazil the United States, in\nreturn for her surplus, gets bonds and securities. And what does that\nmean? It means that the United States is coming to own railroads in\nBrazil, factories, mines, and lands in Brazil. And what is the meaning\nof that in turn?\"\n\nMr. Kowalt pondered and shook his head.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" Ernest continued. \"It means that the resources of\nBrazil are being developed. And now, the next point. When Brazil, under\nthe capitalist system, has developed her resources, she will herself\nhave an unconsumed surplus. Can she get rid of this surplus to the\nUnited States? No, because the United States has herself a surplus. Can\nthe United States do what she previously did--get rid of her surplus to\nBrazil? No, for Brazil now has a surplus, too.\n\n\"What happens? The United States and Brazil must both seek out other\ncountries with undeveloped resources, in order to unload the surpluses\non them. But by the very process of unloading the surpluses, the\nresources of those countries are in turn developed. Soon they have\nsurpluses, and are seeking other countries on which to unload. Now,\ngentlemen, follow me. The planet is only so large. There are only so\nmany countries in the world. What will happen when every country in\nthe world, down to the smallest and last, with a surplus in its hands,\nstands confronting every other country with surpluses in their hands?\"\n\nHe paused and regarded his listeners. The bepuzzlement in their faces\nwas delicious. Also, there was awe in their faces. Out of abstractions\nErnest had conjured a vision and made them see it. They were seeing it\nthen, as they sat there, and they were frightened by it.\n\n\"We started with A B C, Mr. Calvin,\" Ernest said slyly. \"I have now\ngiven you the rest of the alphabet. It is very simple. That is the\nbeauty of it. You surely have the answer forthcoming. What, then, when\nevery country in the world has an unconsumed surplus? Where will your\ncapitalist system be then?\"\n\nBut Mr. Calvin shook a troubled head. He was obviously questing back\nthrough Ernest's reasoning in search of an error.\n\n\"Let me briefly go over the ground with you again,\" Ernest said. \"We\nbegan with a particular industrial process, the shoe factory. We found\nthat the division of the joint product that took place there was similar\nto the division that took place in the sum total of all industrial\nprocesses. We found that labor could buy back with its wages only\nso much of the product, and that capital did not consume all of the\nremainder of the product. We found that when labor had consumed to the\nfull extent of its wages, and when capital had consumed all it wanted,\nthere was still left an unconsumed surplus. We agreed that this surplus\ncould only be disposed of abroad. We agreed, also, that the effect\nof unloading this surplus on another country would be to develop the\nresources of that country, and that in a short time that country\nwould have an unconsumed surplus. We extended this process to all the\ncountries on the planet, till every country was producing every year,\nand every day, an unconsumed surplus, which it could dispose of to no\nother country. And now I ask you again, what are we going to do with\nthose surpluses?\"\n\nStill no one answered.\n\n\"Mr. Calvin?\" Ernest queried.\n\n\"It beats me,\" Mr. Calvin confessed.\n\n\"I never dreamed of such a thing,\" Mr. Asmunsen said. \"And yet it does\nseem clear as print.\"\n\nIt was the first time I had ever heard Karl Marx's* doctrine of surplus\nvalue elaborated, and Ernest had done it so simply that I, too, sat\npuzzled and dumbfounded.\n\n     * Karl Marx--the great intellectual hero of Socialism.  A\n     German Jew of the nineteenth century.  A contemporary of\n     John Stuart Mill. It seems incredible to us that whole\n     generations should have elapsed after the enunciation of\n     Marx's economic discoveries, in which time he was sneered at\n     by the world's accepted thinkers and scholars.  Because of\n     his discoveries he was banished from his native country, and\n     he died an exile in England.\n\n\"I'll tell you a way to get rid of the surplus,\" Ernest said. \"Throw it\ninto the sea. Throw every year hundreds of millions of dollars' worth\nof shoes and wheat and clothing and all the commodities of commerce into\nthe sea. Won't that fix it?\"\n\n\"It will certainly fix it,\" Mr. Calvin answered. \"But it is absurd for\nyou to talk that way.\"\n\nErnest was upon him like a flash.\n\n\"Is it a bit more absurd than what you advocate, you machine-breaker,\nreturning to the antediluvian ways of your forefathers? What do you\npropose in order to get rid of the surplus? You would escape the problem\nof the surplus by not producing any surplus. And how do you propose\nto avoid producing a surplus? By returning to a primitive method of\nproduction, so confused and disorderly and irrational, so wasteful and\ncostly, that it will be impossible to produce a surplus.\"\n\nMr. Calvin swallowed. The point had been driven home. He swallowed again\nand cleared his throat.\n\n\"You are right,\" he said. \"I stand convicted. It is absurd. But we've\ngot to do something. It is a case of life and death for us of the middle\nclass. We refuse to perish. We elect to be absurd and to return to the\ntruly crude and wasteful methods of our forefathers. We will put back\nindustry to its pre-trust stage. We will break the machines. And what\nare you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"But you can't break the machines,\" Ernest replied. \"You cannot make the\ntide of evolution flow backward. Opposed to you are two great forces,\neach of which is more powerful than you of the middle class. The large\ncapitalists, the trusts, in short, will not let you turn back. They\ndon't want the machines destroyed. And greater than the trusts, and\nmore powerful, is labor. It will not let you destroy the machines. The\nownership of the world, along with the machines, lies between the\ntrusts and labor. That is the battle alignment. Neither side wants\nthe destruction of the machines. But each side wants to possess the\nmachines. In this battle the middle class has no place. The middle class\nis a pygmy between two giants. Don't you see, you poor perishing middle\nclass, you are caught between the upper and nether millstones, and even\nnow has the grinding begun.\n\n\"I have demonstrated to you mathematically the inevitable breakdown of\nthe capitalist system. When every country stands with an unconsumed and\nunsalable surplus on its hands, the capitalist system will break down\nunder the terrific structure of profits that it itself has reared. And\nin that day there won't be any destruction of the machines. The struggle\nthen will be for the ownership of the machines. If labor wins, your way\nwill be easy. The United States, and the whole world for that matter,\nwill enter upon a new and tremendous era. Instead of being crushed by\nthe machines, life will be made fairer, and happier, and nobler by\nthem. You of the destroyed middle class, along with labor--there will\nbe nothing but labor then; so you, and all the rest of labor, will\nparticipate in the equitable distribution of the products of the\nwonderful machines. And we, all of us, will make new and more wonderful\nmachines. And there won't be any unconsumed surplus, because there won't\nbe any profits.\"\n\n\"But suppose the trusts win in this battle over the ownership of the\nmachines and the world?\" Mr. Kowalt asked.\n\n\"Then,\" Ernest answered, \"you, and labor, and all of us, will be crushed\nunder the iron heel of a despotism as relentless and terrible as any\ndespotism that has blackened the pages of the history of man. That will\nbe a good name for that despotism, the Iron Heel.\"*\n\n     * The earliest known use of that name to designate the\n     Oligarchy.\n\nThere was a long pause, and every man at the table meditated in ways\nunwonted and profound.\n\n\"But this socialism of yours is a dream,\" Mr. Calvin said; and repeated,\n\"a dream.\"\n\n\"I'll show you something that isn't a dream, then,\" Ernest answered.\n\"And that something I shall call the Oligarchy. You call it the\nPlutocracy. We both mean the same thing, the large capitalists or the\ntrusts. Let us see where the power lies today. And in order to do so,\nlet us apportion society into its class divisions.\n\n\"There are three big classes in society. First comes the Plutocracy,\nwhich is composed of wealthy bankers, railway magnates, corporation\ndirectors, and trust magnates. Second, is the middle class, your class,\ngentlemen, which is composed of farmers, merchants, small manufacturers,\nand professional men. And third and last comes my class, the\nproletariat, which is composed of the wage-workers.*\n\n     * This division of society made by Everhard is in accordance\n     with that made by Lucien Sanial, one of the statistical\n     authorities of that time.  His calculation of the membership\n     of these divisions by occupation, from the United States\n     Census of 1900, is as follows: Plutocratic class, 250,251;\n     Middle class, 8,429,845; and Proletariat class, 20,393,137.\n\n\"You cannot but grant that the ownership of wealth constitutes essential\npower in the United States to-day. How is this wealth owned by these\nthree classes? Here are the figures. The Plutocracy owns sixty-seven\nbillions of wealth. Of the total number of persons engaged in\noccupations in the United States, only nine-tenths of one per cent are\nfrom the Plutocracy, yet the Plutocracy owns seventy per cent of the\ntotal wealth. The middle class owns twenty-four billions. Twenty-nine\nper cent of those in occupations are from the middle class, and they own\ntwenty-five per cent of the total wealth. Remains the proletariat. It\nowns four billions. Of all persons in occupations, seventy per cent\ncome from the proletariat; and the proletariat owns four per cent of the\ntotal wealth. Where does the power lie, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"From your own figures, we of the middle class are more powerful than\nlabor,\" Mr. Asmunsen remarked.\n\n\"Calling us weak does not make you stronger in the face of the strength\nof the Plutocracy,\" Ernest retorted. \"And furthermore, I'm not done with\nyou. There is a greater strength than wealth, and it is greater because\nit cannot be taken away. Our strength, the strength of the proletariat,\nis in our muscles, in our hands to cast ballots, in our fingers to pull\ntriggers. This strength we cannot be stripped of. It is the primitive\nstrength, it is the strength that is to life germane, it is the strength\nthat is stronger than wealth, and that wealth cannot take away.\n\n\"But your strength is detachable. It can be taken away from you. Even\nnow the Plutocracy is taking it away from you. In the end it will take\nit all away from you. And then you will cease to be the middle class.\nYou will descend to us. You will become proletarians. And the beauty of\nit is that you will then add to our strength. We will hail you brothers,\nand we will fight shoulder to shoulder in the cause of humanity.\n\n\"You see, labor has nothing concrete of which to be despoiled. Its\nshare of the wealth of the country consists of clothes and household\nfurniture, with here and there, in very rare cases, an unencumbered\nhome. But you have the concrete wealth, twenty-four billions of it, and\nthe Plutocracy will take it away from you. Of course, there is the large\nlikelihood that the proletariat will take it away first. Don't you\nsee your position, gentlemen? The middle class is a wobbly little lamb\nbetween a lion and a tiger. If one doesn't get you, the other will. And\nif the Plutocracy gets you first, why it's only a matter of time when\nthe Proletariat gets the Plutocracy.\n\n\"Even your present wealth is not a true measure of your power. The\nstrength of your wealth at this moment is only an empty shell. That is\nwhy you are crying out your feeble little battle-cry, 'Return to the\nways of our fathers.' You are aware of your impotency. You know that\nyour strength is an empty shell. And I'll show you the emptiness of it.\n\n\"What power have the farmers? Over fifty per cent are thralls by virtue\nof the fact that they are merely tenants or are mortgaged. And all of\nthem are thralls by virtue of the fact that the trusts already own or\ncontrol (which is the same thing only better)--own and control all\nthe means of marketing the crops, such as cold storage, railroads,\nelevators, and steamship lines. And, furthermore, the trusts control\nthe markets. In all this the farmers are without power. As regards their\npolitical and governmental power, I'll take that up later, along with\nthe political and governmental power of the whole middle class.\n\n\"Day by day the trusts squeeze out the farmers as they squeezed out Mr.\nCalvin and the rest of the dairymen. And day by day are the merchants\nsqueezed out in the same way. Do you remember how, in six months, the\nTobacco Trust squeezed out over four hundred cigar stores in New York\nCity alone? Where are the old-time owners of the coal fields? You know\ntoday, without my telling you, that the Railroad Trust owns or controls\nthe entire anthracite and bituminous coal fields. Doesn't the Standard\nOil Trust* own a score of the ocean lines? And does it not also control\ncopper, to say nothing of running a smelter trust as a little side\nenterprise? There are ten thousand cities in the United States to-night\nlighted by the companies owned or controlled by Standard Oil, and in\nas many cities all the electric transportation,--urban, suburban, and\ninterurban,--is in the hands of Standard Oil. The small capitalists who\nwere in these thousands of enterprises are gone. You know that. It's the\nsame way that you are going.\n\n     * Standard Oil and Rockefeller--see upcoming footnote:\n     \"Rockefeller began as a member . . .\"\n\n\"The small manufacturer is like the farmer; and small manufacturers\nand farmers to-day are reduced, to all intents and purposes, to feudal\ntenure. For that matter, the professional men and the artists are\nat this present moment villeins in everything but name, while the\npoliticians are henchmen. Why do you, Mr. Calvin, work all your nights\nand days to organize the farmers, along with the rest of the middle\nclass, into a new political party? Because the politicians of the old\nparties will have nothing to do with your atavistic ideas; and with your\natavistic ideas, they will have nothing to do because they are what I\nsaid they are, henchmen, retainers of the Plutocracy.\n\n\"I spoke of the professional men and the artists as villeins. What else\nare they? One and all, the professors, the preachers, and the editors,\nhold their jobs by serving the Plutocracy, and their service consists of\npropagating only such ideas as are either harmless to or commendatory\nof the Plutocracy. Whenever they propagate ideas that menace the\nPlutocracy, they lose their jobs, in which case, if they have not\nprovided for the rainy day, they descend into the proletariat and either\nperish or become working-class agitators. And don't forget that it is\nthe press, the pulpit, and the university that mould public opinion, set\nthe thought-pace of the nation. As for the artists, they merely pander\nto the little less than ignoble tastes of the Plutocracy.\n\n\"But after all, wealth in itself is not the real power; it is the means\nto power, and power is governmental. Who controls the government to-day?\nThe proletariat with its twenty millions engaged in occupations? Even\nyou laugh at the idea. Does the middle class, with its eight million\noccupied members? No more than the proletariat. Who, then, controls\nthe government? The Plutocracy, with its paltry quarter of a million\nof occupied members. But this quarter of a million does not control the\ngovernment, though it renders yeoman service. It is the brain of the\nPlutocracy that controls the government, and this brain consists of\nseven* small and powerful groups of men. And do not forget that these\ngroups are working to-day practically in unison.\n\n     * Even as late as 1907, it was considered that eleven groups\n     dominated the country, but this number was reduced by the\n     amalgamation of the five railroad groups into a supreme\n     combination of all the railroads.  These five groups so\n     amalgamated, along with their financial and political\n     allies, were (1) James J. Hill with his control of the\n     Northwest; (2) the Pennsylvania railway group, Schiff\n     financial manager, with big banking firms of Philadelphia\n     and New York; (3) Harriman, with Frick for counsel and Odell\n     as political lieutenant, controlling the central\n     continental, Southwestern and Southern Pacific Coast lines\n     of transportation; (4) the Gould family railway interests;\n     and (5) Moore, Reid, and Leeds, known as the \"Rock Island\n     crowd.\"  These strong oligarchs arose out of the conflict of\n     competition and travelled the inevitable road toward\n     combination.\n\n\"Let me point out the power of but one of them, the railroad group. It\nemploys forty thousand lawyers to defeat the people in the courts. It\nissues countless thousands of free passes to judges, bankers, editors,\nministers, university men, members of state legislatures, and of\nCongress. It maintains luxurious lobbies* at every state capital, and\nat the national capital; and in all the cities and towns of the land\nit employs an immense army of pettifoggers and small politicians whose\nbusiness is to attend primaries, pack conventions, get on juries, bribe\njudges, and in every way to work for its interests.**\n\n     * Lobby--a peculiar institution for bribing, bulldozing, and\n     corrupting the legislators who were supposed to represent\n     the people's interests.\n\n     ** A decade before this speech of Everhard's, the New York\n     Board of Trade issued a report from which the following is\n     quoted: \"The railroads control absolutely the legislatures\n     of a majority of the states of the Union; they make and\n     unmake United States Senators, congressmen, and governors,\n     and are practically dictators of the governmental policy of\n     the United States.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have merely sketched the power of one of the seven groups\nthat constitute the brain of the Plutocracy.* Your twenty-four billions\nof wealth does not give you twenty-five cents' worth of governmental\npower. It is an empty shell, and soon even the empty shell will be taken\naway from you. The Plutocracy has all power in its hands to-day. It\nto-day makes the laws, for it owns the Senate, Congress, the courts, and\nthe state legislatures. And not only that. Behind law must be force to\nexecute the law. To-day the Plutocracy makes the law, and to enforce the\nlaw it has at its beck and call the, police, the army, the navy, and,\nlastly, the militia, which is you, and me, and all of us.\"\n\n     * Rockefeller began as a member of the proletariat, and\n     through thrift and cunning succeeded in developing the first\n     perfect trust, namely that known as Standard Oil.  We cannot\n     forbear giving the following remarkable page from the\n     history of the times, to show how the need for reinvestment\n     of the Standard Oil surplus crushed out small capitalists\n     and hastened the breakdown of the capitalist system.  David\n     Graham Phillips was a radical writer of the period, and the\n     quotation, by him, is taken from a copy of the Saturday\n     Evening Post, dated October 4, 1902 A.D.  This is the only\n     copy of this publication that has come down to us, and yet,\n     from its appearance and content, we cannot but conclude that\n     it was one of the popular periodicals with a large\n     circulation.  The quotation here follows:\n\n     \"About ten years ago Rockefeller's income was given as\n     thirty millions by an excellent authority.  He had reached\n     the limit of profitable investment of profits in the oil\n     industry.  Here, then, were these enormous sums in cash\n     pouring in--more than $2,000,000 a month for John Davison\n     Rockefeller alone.  The problem of reinvestment became more\n     serious.  It became a nightmare.  The oil income was\n     swelling, swelling, and the number of sound investments\n     limited, even more limited than it is now.  It was through\n     no special eagerness for more gains that the Rockefellers\n     began to branch out from oil into other things.  They were\n     forced, swept on by this inrolling tide of wealth which\n     their monopoly magnet irresistibly attracted.  They\n     developed a staff of investment seekers and investigators.\n     It is said that the chief of this staff has a salary of\n     $125,000 a year.\n\n     \"The first conspicuous excursion and incursion of the\n     Rockefellers was into the railway field.  By 1895 they\n     controlled one-fifth of the railway mileage of the country.\n     What do they own or, through dominant ownership, control\n     to-day?  They are powerful in all the great railways of New\n     York, north, east, and west, except one, where their share\n     is only a few millions.  They are in most of the great\n     railways radiating from Chicago.  They dominate in several\n     of the systems that extend to the Pacific.  It is their\n     votes that make Mr. Morgan so potent, though, it may be\n     added, they need his brains more than he needs their votes--\n     at present, and the combination of the two constitutes in\n     large measure the 'community of interest.'\n\n     \"But railways could not alone absorb rapidly enough those\n     mighty floods of gold.  Presently John D. Rockefeller's\n     $2,500,000 a month had increased to four, to five, to six\n     millions a month, to $75,000,000 a year.  Illuminating oil\n     was becoming all profit.  The reinvestments of income were\n     adding their mite of many annual millions.\n\n     \"The Rockefellers went into gas and electricity when those\n     industries had developed to the safe investment stage.  And\n     now a large part of the American people must begin to enrich\n     the Rockefellers as soon as the sun goes down, no matter\n     what form of illuminant they use.  They went into farm\n     mortgages.  It is said that when prosperity a few years ago\n     enabled the farmers to rid themselves of their mortgages,\n     John D. Rockefeller was moved almost to tears; eight\n     millions which he had thought taken care of for years to\n     come at a good interest were suddenly dumped upon his\n     doorstep and there set up a-squawking for a new home.  This\n     unexpected addition to his worriments in finding places for\n     the progeny of his petroleum and their progeny and their\n     progeny's progeny was too much for the equanimity of a man\n     without a digestion. . . .\n\n     \"The Rockefellers went into mines--iron and coal and copper\n     and lead; into other industrial companies; into street\n     railways, into national, state, and municipal bonds; into\n     steamships and steamboats and telegraphy; into real estate,\n     into skyscrapers and residences and hotels and business\n     blocks; into life insurance, into banking.  There was soon\n     literally no field of industry where their millions were not\n     at work. . . .\n\n     \"The Rockefeller bank--the National City Bank--is by itself\n     far and away the biggest bank in the United States.  It is\n     exceeded in the world only by the Bank of England and the\n     Bank of France.  The deposits average more than one hundred\n     millions a day; and it dominates the call loan market on\n     Wall Street and the stock market. But it is not alone; it is\n     the head of the Rockefeller chain of banks, which includes\n     fourteen banks and trust companies in New York City, and\n     banks of great strength and influence in every large money\n     center in the country.\n\n     \"John D. Rockefeller owns Standard Oil stock worth between\n     four and five hundred millions at the market quotations.  He\n     has a hundred millions in the steel trust, almost as much in\n     a single western railway system, half as much in a second,\n     and so on and on and on until the mind wearies of the\n     cataloguing.  His income last year was about $100,000,000--\n     it is doubtful if the incomes of all the Rothschilds\n     together make a greater sum.  And it is going up by leaps\n     and bounds.\"\n\n\n     Little discussion took place after this, and the dinner soon broke\n     up.  All were quiet and subdued, and leave-taking was done with low\n     voices.  It seemed almost that they were scared by the vision of\n     the times they had seen.\n\n     \"The situation is, indeed, serious,\" Mr. Calvin said to Ernest.  \"I\n     have little quarrel with the way you have depicted it.  Only I\n     disagree with you about the doom of the middle class.  We shall\n     survive, and we shall overthrow the trusts.\"\n\n     \"And return to the ways of your fathers,\" Ernest finished for him.\n\n     \"Even so,\" Mr. Calvin answered gravely.  \"I know it's a sort of\n     machine-breaking, and that it is absurd.  But then life seems\n     absurd to-day, what of the machinations of the Plutocracy.  And at\n     any rate, our sort of machine-breaking is at least practical and\n     possible, which your dream is not.  Your socialistic dream is . . .\n     well, a dream.  We cannot follow you.\"\n\n     \"I only wish you fellows knew a little something about evolution\n     and sociology,\" Ernest said wistfully, as they shook hands.  \"We\n     would be saved so much trouble if you did.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE VORTEX\n\n\nFollowing like thunder claps upon the Business Men's dinner, occurred\nevent after event of terrifying moment; and I, little I, who had lived\nso placidly all my days in the quiet university town, found myself and\nmy personal affairs drawn into the vortex of the great world-affairs.\nWhether it was my love for Ernest, or the clear sight he had given me of\nthe society in which I lived, that made me a revolutionist, I know not;\nbut a revolutionist I became, and I was plunged into a whirl of\nhappenings that would have been inconceivable three short months before.\n\nThe crisis in my own fortunes came simultaneously with great crises in\nsociety. First of all, father was discharged from the university. Oh,\nhe was not technically discharged. His resignation was demanded, that\nwas all. This, in itself, did not amount to much. Father, in fact, was\ndelighted. He was especially delighted because his discharge had been\nprecipitated by the publication of his book, \"Economics and Education.\"\nIt clinched his argument, he contended. What better evidence could be\nadvanced to prove that education was dominated by the capitalist class?\n\nBut this proof never got anywhere. Nobody knew he had been forced to\nresign from the university. He was so eminent a scientist that such an\nannouncement, coupled with the reason for his enforced resignation,\nwould have created somewhat of a furor all over the world. The\nnewspapers showered him with praise and honor, and commended him for\nhaving given up the drudgery of the lecture room in order to devote his\nwhole time to scientific research.\n\nAt first father laughed. Then he became angry--tonic angry. Then came\nthe suppression of his book. This suppression was performed secretly,\nso secretly that at first we could not comprehend. The publication of\nthe book had immediately caused a bit of excitement in the country.\nFather had been politely abused in the capitalist press, the tone of the\nabuse being to the effect that it was a pity so great a scientist should\nleave his field and invade the realm of sociology, about which he knew\nnothing and wherein he had promptly become lost. This lasted for a\nweek, while father chuckled and said the book had touched a sore spot on\ncapitalism. And then, abruptly, the newspapers and the critical\nmagazines ceased saying anything about the book at all. Also, and with\nequal suddenness, the book disappeared from the market. Not a copy was\nobtainable from any bookseller. Father wrote to the publishers and was\ninformed that the plates had been accidentally injured. An\nunsatisfactory correspondence followed. Driven finally to an\nunequivocal stand, the publishers stated that they could not see their\nway to putting the book into type again, but that they were willing to\nrelinquish their rights in it.\n\n\"And you won't find another publishing house in the country to touch\nit,\" Ernest said. \"And if I were you, I'd hunt cover right now. You've\nmerely got a foretaste of the Iron Heel.\"\n\nBut father was nothing if not a scientist. He never believed in jumping\nto conclusions. A laboratory experiment was no experiment if it were\nnot carried through in all its details. So he patiently went the round\nof the publishing houses. They gave a multitude of excuses, but not one\nhouse would consider the book.\n\nWhen father became convinced that the book had actually been suppressed,\nhe tried to get the fact into the newspapers; but his communications\nwere ignored. At a political meeting of the socialists, where many\nreporters were present, father saw his chance. He arose and related the\nhistory of the suppression of the book. He laughed next day when he\nread the newspapers, and then he grew angry to a degree that eliminated\nall tonic qualities. The papers made no mention of the book, but they\nmisreported him beautifully. They twisted his words and phrases away\nfrom the context, and turned his subdued and controlled remarks into a\nhowling anarchistic speech. It was done artfully. One instance, in\nparticular, I remember. He had used the phrase \"social revolution.\"\nThe reporter merely dropped out \"social.\" This was sent out all over\nthe country in an Associated Press despatch, and from all over the\ncountry arose a cry of alarm. Father was branded as a nihilist and an\nanarchist, and in one cartoon that was copied widely he was portrayed\nwaving a red flag at the head of a mob of long-haired, wild-eyed men who\nbore in their hands torches, knives, and dynamite bombs.\n\nHe was assailed terribly in the press, in long and abusive editorials,\nfor his anarchy, and hints were made of mental breakdown on his part.\nThis behavior, on the part of the capitalist press, was nothing new,\nErnest told us. It was the custom, he said, to send reporters to all\nthe socialist meetings for the express purpose of misreporting and\ndistorting what was said, in order to frighten the middle class away\nfrom any possible affiliation with the proletariat. And repeatedly\nErnest warned father to cease fighting and to take to cover.\n\nThe socialist press of the country took up the fight, however, and\nthroughout the reading portion of the working class it was known that\nthe book had been suppressed. But this knowledge stopped with the\nworking class. Next, the \"Appeal to Reason,\" a big socialist publishing\nhouse, arranged with father to bring out the book. Father was jubilant,\nbut Ernest was alarmed.\n\n\"I tell you we are on the verge of the unknown,\" he insisted. \"Big\nthings are happening secretly all around us. We can feel them. We do\nnot know what they are, but they are there. The whole fabric of society\nis a-tremble with them. Don't ask me. I don't know myself. But out of\nthis flux of society something is about to crystallize. It is\ncrystallizing now. The suppression of the book is a precipitation. How\nmany books have been suppressed? We haven't the least idea. We are in\nthe dark. We have no way of learning. Watch out next for the\nsuppression of the socialist press and socialist publishing houses. I'm\nafraid it's coming. We are going to be throttled.\"\n\nErnest had his hand on the pulse of events even more closely than the\nrest of the socialists, and within two days the first blow was struck.\nThe Appeal to Reason was a weekly, and its regular circulation amongst\nthe proletariat was seven hundred and fifty thousand. Also, it very\nfrequently got out special editions of from two to five millions. These\ngreat editions were paid for and distributed by the small army of\nvoluntary workers who had marshalled around the Appeal. The first blow\nwas aimed at these special editions, and it was a crushing one. By an\narbitrary ruling of the Post Office, these editions were decided to be\nnot the regular circulation of the paper, and for that reason were\ndenied admission to the mails.\n\nA week later the Post Office Department ruled that the paper was\nseditious, and barred it entirely from the mails. This was a fearful\nblow to the socialist propaganda. The Appeal was desperate. It devised\na plan of reaching its subscribers through the express companies, but\nthey declined to handle it. This was the end of the Appeal. But not\nquite. It prepared to go on with its book publishing. Twenty thousand\ncopies of father's book were in the bindery, and the presses were\nturning off more. And then, without warning, a mob arose one night,\nand, under a waving American flag, singing patriotic songs, set fire to\nthe great plant of the Appeal and totally destroyed it.\n\nNow Girard, Kansas, was a quiet, peaceable town. There had never been\nany labor troubles there. The Appeal paid union wages; and, in fact,\nwas the backbone of the town, giving employment to hundreds of men and\nwomen. It was not the citizens of Girard that composed the mob. This\nmob had risen up out of the earth apparently, and to all intents and\npurposes, its work done, it had gone back into the earth. Ernest saw in\nthe affair the most sinister import.\n\n\"The Black Hundreds* are being organized in the United States,\" he said.\n\"This is the beginning. There will be more of it. The Iron Heel is\ngetting bold.\"\n\n     * The Black Hundreds were reactionary mobs organized by the\n     perishing Autocracy in the Russian Revolution.  These\n     reactionary groups attacked the revolutionary groups, and\n     also, at needed moments, rioted and destroyed property so as\n     to afford the Autocracy the pretext of calling out the\n     Cossacks.\n\nAnd so perished father's book. We were to see much of the Black Hundreds\nas the days went by. Week by week more of the socialist papers were\nbarred from the mails, and in a number of instances the Black Hundreds\ndestroyed the socialist presses. Of course, the newspapers of the\nland lived up to the reactionary policy of the ruling class, and the\ndestroyed socialist press was misrepresented and vilified, while\nthe Black Hundreds were represented as true patriots and saviours of\nsociety. So convincing was all this misrepresentation that even sincere\nministers in the pulpit praised the Black Hundreds while regretting the\nnecessity of violence.\n\nHistory was making fast. The fall elections were soon to occur, and\nErnest was nominated by the socialist party to run for Congress. His\nchance for election was most favorable. The street-car strike in San\nFrancisco had been broken. And following upon it the teamsters' strike\nhad been broken. These two defeats had been very disastrous to organized\nlabor. The whole Water Front Federation, along with its allies in the\nstructural trades, had backed up the teamsters, and all had been smashed\ndown ingloriously. It had been a bloody strike. The police had broken\ncountless heads with their riot clubs; and the death list had been\naugmented by the turning loose of a machine-gun on the strikers from the\nbarns of the Marsden Special Delivery Company.\n\nIn consequence, the men were sullen and vindictive. They wanted blood,\nand revenge. Beaten on their chosen field, they were ripe to seek\nrevenge by means of political action. They still maintained their labor\norganization, and this gave them strength in the political struggle that\nwas on. Ernest's chance for election grew stronger and stronger. Day by\nday unions and more unions voted their support to the socialists, until\neven Ernest laughed when the Undertakers' Assistants and the Chicken\nPickers fell into line. Labor became mulish. While it packed the\nsocialist meetings with mad enthusiasm, it was impervious to the wiles\nof the old-party politicians. The old-party orators were usually greeted\nwith empty halls, though occasionally they encountered full halls where\nthey were so roughly handled that more than once it was necessary to\ncall out the police reserves.\n\nHistory was making fast. The air was vibrant with things happening and\nimpending. The country was on the verge of hard times,* caused by a\nseries of prosperous years wherein the difficulty of disposing abroad\nof the unconsumed surplus had become increasingly difficult. Industries\nwere working short time; many great factories were standing idle against\nthe time when the surplus should be gone; and wages were being cut right\nand left.\n\n     * Under the capitalist regime these periods of hard times\n     were as inevitable as they were absurd.  Prosperity always\n     brought calamity.  This, of course, was due to the excess of\n     unconsumed profits that was piled up.\n\nAlso, the great machinist strike had been broken. Two hundred thousand\nmachinists, along with their five hundred thousand allies in the\nmetalworking trades, had been defeated in as bloody a strike as had ever\nmarred the United States. Pitched battles had been fought with the small\narmies of armed strike-breakers* put in the field by the employers'\nassociations; the Black Hundreds, appearing in scores of wide-scattered\nplaces, had destroyed property; and, in consequence, a hundred thousand\nregular soldiers of the United States has been called out to put a\nfrightful end to the whole affair. A number of the labor leaders had\nbeen executed; many others had been sentenced to prison, while thousands\nof the rank and file of the strikers had been herded into bull-pens**\nand abominably treated by the soldiers.\n\n     * Strike-breakers--these were, in purpose and practice and\n     everything except name, the private soldiers of the\n     capitalists. They were thoroughly organized and well armed,\n     and they were held in readiness to be hurled in special\n     trains to any part of the country where labor went on strike\n     or was locked out by the employers.  Only those curious\n     times could have given rise to the amazing spectacle of one,\n     Farley, a notorious commander of strike-breakers, who, in\n     1906, swept across the United States in special trains from\n     New York to San Francisco with an army of twenty-five\n     hundred men, fully armed and equipped, to break a strike of\n     the San Francisco street-car men.  Such an act was in direct\n     violation of the laws of the land.  The fact that this act,\n     and thousands of similar acts, went unpunished, goes to show\n     how completely the judiciary was the creature of the\n     Plutocracy.\n\n     ** Bull-pen--in a miners' strike in Idaho, in the latter\n     part of the nineteenth century, it happened that many of the\n     strikers were confined in a bull-pen by the troops.  The\n     practice and the name continued in the twentieth century.\n\nThe years of prosperity were now to be paid for. All markets were\nglutted; all markets were falling; and amidst the general crumble\nof prices the price of labor crumbled fastest of all. The land was\nconvulsed with industrial dissensions. Labor was striking here, there,\nand everywhere; and where it was not striking, it was being turned out\nby the capitalists. The papers were filled with tales of violence and\nblood. And through it all the Black Hundreds played their part. Riot,\narson, and wanton destruction of property was their function, and well\nthey performed it. The whole regular army was in the field, called there\nby the actions of the Black Hundreds.* All cities and towns were like\narmed camps, and laborers were shot down like dogs. Out of the vast\narmy of the unemployed the strike-breakers were recruited; and when\nthe strike-breakers were worsted by the labor unions, the troops always\nappeared and crushed the unions. Then there was the militia. As yet, it\nwas not necessary to have recourse to the secret militia law. Only the\nregularly organized militia was out, and it was out everywhere. And\nin this time of terror, the regular army was increased an additional\nhundred thousand by the government.\n\n     * The name only, and not the idea, was imported from Russia.\n     The Black Hundreds were a development out of the secret\n     agents of the capitalists, and their use arose in the labor\n     struggles of the nineteenth century.  There is no discussion\n     of this.  No less an authority of the times than Carroll D.\n     Wright, United States Commissioner of Labor, is responsible\n     for the statement.  From his book, entitled \"The Battles of\n     Labor,\" is quoted the declaration that \"in some of the great\n     historic strikes the employers themselves have instigated\n     acts of violence;\" that manufacturers have deliberately\n     provoked strikes in order to get rid of surplus stock; and\n     that freight cars have been burned by employers' agents\n     during railroad strikes in order to increase disorder.  It\n     was out of these secret agents of the employers that the\n     Black Hundreds arose; and it was they, in turn, that later\n     became that terrible weapon of the Oligarchy, the agents-\n     provocateurs.\n\nNever had labor received such an all-around beating. The great captains\nof industry, the oligarchs, had for the first time thrown their full\nweight into the breach the struggling employers' associations had made.\nThese associations were practically middle-class affairs, and now,\ncompelled by hard times and crashing markets, and aided by the great\ncaptains of industry, they gave organized labor an awful and decisive\ndefeat. It was an all-powerful alliance, but it was an alliance of the\nlion and the lamb, as the middle class was soon to learn.\n\nLabor was bloody and sullen, but crushed. Yet its defeat did not put\nan end to the hard times. The banks, themselves constituting one of the\nmost important forces of the Oligarchy, continued to call in credits.\nThe Wall Street* group turned the stock market into a maelstrom where\nthe values of all the land crumbled away almost to nothingness. And\nout of all the rack and ruin rose the form of the nascent Oligarchy,\nimperturbable, indifferent, and sure. Its serenity and certitude was\nterrifying. Not only did it use its own vast power, but it used all the\npower of the United States Treasury to carry out its plans.\n\n     * Wall Street--so named from a street in ancient New York,\n     where was situated the stock exchange, and where the\n     irrational organization of society permitted underhanded\n     manipulation of all the industries of the country.\n\nThe captains of industry had turned upon the middle class. The\nemployers' associations, that had helped the captains of industry to\ntear and rend labor, were now torn and rent by their quondam allies.\nAmidst the crashing of the middle men, the small business men and\nmanufacturers, the trusts stood firm. Nay, the trusts did more than\nstand firm. They were active. They sowed wind, and wind, and ever more\nwind; for they alone knew how to reap the whirlwind and make a profit\nout of it. And such profits! Colossal profits! Strong enough themselves\nto weather the storm that was largely their own brewing, they turned\nloose and plundered the wrecks that floated about them. Values were\npitifully and inconceivably shrunken, and the trusts added hugely\nto their holdings, even extending their enterprises into many new\nfields--and always at the expense of the middle class.\n\nThus the summer of 1912 witnessed the virtual death-thrust to the middle\nclass. Even Ernest was astounded at the quickness with which it had been\ndone. He shook his head ominously and looked forward without hope to the\nfall elections.\n\n\"It's no use,\" he said. \"We are beaten. The Iron Heel is here. I had\nhoped for a peaceable victory at the ballot-box. I was wrong. Wickson\nwas right. We shall be robbed of our few remaining liberties; the Iron\nHeel will walk upon our faces; nothing remains but a bloody revolution\nof the working class. Of course we will win, but I shudder to think of\nit.\"\n\nAnd from then on Ernest pinned his faith in revolution. In this he was\nin advance of his party. His fellow-socialists could not agree with him.\nThey still insisted that victory could be gained through the elections.\nIt was not that they were stunned. They were too cool-headed and\ncourageous for that. They were merely incredulous, that was all. Ernest\ncould not get them seriously to fear the coming of the Oligarchy. They\nwere stirred by him, but they were too sure of their own strength. There\nwas no room in their theoretical social evolution for an oligarchy,\ntherefore the Oligarchy could not be.\n\n\"We'll send you to Congress and it will be all right,\" they told him at\none of our secret meetings.\n\n\"And when they take me out of Congress,\" Ernest replied coldly, \"and put\nme against a wall, and blow my brains out--what then?\"\n\n\"Then we'll rise in our might,\" a dozen voices answered at once.\n\n\"Then you'll welter in your gore,\" was his retort. \"I've heard that song\nsung by the middle class, and where is it now in its might?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE GREAT ADVENTURE\n\n\nMr. Wickson did not send for father. They met by chance on the\nferry-boat to San Francisco, so that the warning he gave father was not\npremeditated. Had they not met accidentally, there would not have been\nany warning. Not that the outcome would have been different, however.\nFather came of stout old Mayflower* stock, and the blood was imperative\nin him.\n\n     * One of the first ships that carried colonies to America,\n     after the discovery of the New World.  Descendants of these\n     original colonists were for a while inordinately proud of\n     their genealogy; but in time the blood became so widely\n     diffused that it ran in the veins practically of all\n     Americans.\n\n\"Ernest was right,\" he told me, as soon as he had returned home. \"Ernest\nis a very remarkable young man, and I'd rather see you his wife than the\nwife of Rockefeller himself or the King of England.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked in alarm.\n\n\"The Oligarchy is about to tread upon our faces--yours and mine. Wickson\nas much as told me so. He was very kind--for an oligarch. He offered to\nreinstate me in the university. What do you think of that? He, Wickson,\na sordid money-grabber, has the power to determine whether I shall or\nshall not teach in the university of the state. But he offered me even\nbetter than that--offered to make me president of some great college of\nphysical sciences that is being planned--the Oligarchy must get rid of\nits surplus somehow, you see.\n\n\"'Do you remember what I told that socialist lover of your daughter's?'\nhe said. 'I told him that we would walk upon the faces of the working\nclass. And so we shall. As for you, I have for you a deep respect as\na scientist; but if you throw your fortunes in with the working\nclass--well, watch out for your face, that is all.' And then he turned\nand left me.\"\n\n\"It means we'll have to marry earlier than you planned,\" was Ernest's\ncomment when we told him.\n\nI could not follow his reasoning, but I was soon to learn it. It was at\nthis time that the quarterly dividend of the Sierra Mills was paid--or,\nrather, should have been paid, for father did not receive his. After\nwaiting several days, father wrote to the secretary. Promptly came\nthe reply that there was no record on the books of father's owning any\nstock, and a polite request for more explicit information.\n\n\"I'll make it explicit enough, confound him,\" father declared, and\ndeparted for the bank to get the stock in question from his safe-deposit\nbox.\n\n\"Ernest is a very remarkable man,\" he said when he got back and while\nI was helping him off with his overcoat. \"I repeat, my daughter, that\nyoung man of yours is a very remarkable young man.\"\n\nI had learned, whenever he praised Ernest in such fashion, to expect\ndisaster.\n\n\"They have already walked upon my face,\" father explained. \"There was no\nstock. The box was empty. You and Ernest will have to get married pretty\nquickly.\"\n\nFather insisted on laboratory methods. He brought the Sierra Mills into\ncourt, but he could not bring the books of the Sierra Mills into court.\nHe did not control the courts, and the Sierra Mills did. That explained\nit all. He was thoroughly beaten by the law, and the bare-faced robbery\nheld good.\n\nIt is almost laughable now, when I look back on it, the way father was\nbeaten. He met Wickson accidentally on the street in San Francisco,\nand he told Wickson that he was a damned scoundrel. And then father was\narrested for attempted assault, fined in the police court, and bound\nover to keep the peace. It was all so ridiculous that when he got\nhome he had to laugh himself. But what a furor was raised in the\nlocal papers! There was grave talk about the bacillus of violence that\ninfected all men who embraced socialism; and father, with his long and\npeaceful life, was instanced as a shining example of how the bacillus\nof violence worked. Also, it was asserted by more than one paper that\nfather's mind had weakened under the strain of scientific study, and\nconfinement in a state asylum for the insane was suggested. Nor was this\nmerely talk. It was an imminent peril. But father was wise enough to see\nit. He had the Bishop's experience to lesson from, and he lessoned\nwell. He kept quiet no matter what injustice was perpetrated on him, and\nreally, I think, surprised his enemies.\n\nThere was the matter of the house--our home. A mortgage was foreclosed\non it, and we had to give up possession. Of course there wasn't any\nmortgage, and never had been any mortgage. The ground had been bought\noutright, and the house had been paid for when it was built. And house\nand lot had always been free and unencumbered. Nevertheless there was\nthe mortgage, properly and legally drawn up and signed, with a record\nof the payments of interest through a number of years. Father made no\noutcry. As he had been robbed of his money, so was he now robbed of his\nhome. And he had no recourse. The machinery of society was in the hands\nof those who were bent on breaking him. He was a philosopher at heart,\nand he was no longer even angry.\n\n\"I am doomed to be broken,\" he said to me; \"but that is no reason that I\nshould not try to be shattered as little as possible. These old bones of\nmine are fragile, and I've learned my lesson. God knows I don't want to\nspend my last days in an insane asylum.\"\n\nWhich reminds me of Bishop Morehouse, whom I have neglected for many\npages. But first let me tell of my marriage. In the play of events, my\nmarriage sinks into insignificance, I know, so I shall barely mention\nit.\n\n\"Now we shall become real proletarians,\" father said, when we were\ndriven from our home. \"I have often envied that young man of yours for\nhis actual knowledge of the proletariat. Now I shall see and learn for\nmyself.\"\n\nFather must have had strong in him the blood of adventure. He looked\nupon our catastrophe in the light of an adventure. No anger nor\nbitterness possessed him. He was too philosophic and simple to be\nvindictive, and he lived too much in the world of mind to miss the\ncreature comforts we were giving up. So it was, when we moved to San\nFrancisco into four wretched rooms in the slum south of Market Street,\nthat he embarked upon the adventure with the joy and enthusiasm of\na child--combined with the clear sight and mental grasp of an\nextraordinary intellect. He really never crystallized mentally. He had\nno false sense of values. Conventional or habitual values meant nothing\nto him. The only values he recognized were mathematical and scientific\nfacts. My father was a great man. He had the mind and the soul that only\ngreat men have. In ways he was even greater than Ernest, than whom I\nhave known none greater.\n\nEven I found some relief in our change of living. If nothing else, I\nwas escaping from the organized ostracism that had been our increasing\nportion in the university town ever since the enmity of the nascent\nOligarchy had been incurred. And the change was to me likewise\nadventure, and the greatest of all, for it was love-adventure. The\nchange in our fortunes had hastened my marriage, and it was as a\nwife that I came to live in the four rooms on Pell Street, in the San\nFrancisco slum.\n\nAnd this out of all remains: I made Ernest happy. I came into his stormy\nlife, not as a new perturbing force, but as one that made toward peace\nand repose. I gave him rest. It was the guerdon of my love for him.\nIt was the one infallible token that I had not failed. To bring\nforgetfulness, or the light of gladness, into those poor tired eyes of\nhis--what greater joy could have blessed me than that?\n\nThose dear tired eyes. He toiled as few men ever toiled, and all his\nlifetime he toiled for others. That was the measure of his manhood. He\nwas a humanist and a lover. And he, with his incarnate spirit of battle,\nhis gladiator body and his eagle spirit--he was as gentle and tender to\nme as a poet. He was a poet. A singer in deeds. And all his life he sang\nthe song of man. And he did it out of sheer love of man, and for man he\ngave his life and was crucified.\n\nAnd all this he did with no hope of future reward. In his conception of\nthings there was no future life. He, who fairly burnt with immortality,\ndenied himself immortality--such was the paradox of him. He, so warm\nin spirit, was dominated by that cold and forbidding philosophy,\nmaterialistic monism. I used to refute him by telling him that I\nmeasured his immortality by the wings of his soul, and that I should\nhave to live endless aeons in order to achieve the full measurement.\nWhereat he would laugh, and his arms would leap out to me, and he would\ncall me his sweet metaphysician; and the tiredness would pass out of his\neyes, and into them would flood the happy love-light that was in itself\na new and sufficient advertisement of his immortality.\n\nAlso, he used to call me his dualist, and he would explain how Kant, by\nmeans of pure reason, had abolished reason, in order to worship God. And\nhe drew the parallel and included me guilty of a similar act. And when I\npleaded guilty, but defended the act as highly rational, he but pressed\nme closer and laughed as only one of God's own lovers could laugh. I\nwas wont to deny that heredity and environment could explain his own\noriginality and genius, any more than could the cold groping finger of\nscience catch and analyze and classify that elusive essence that lurked\nin the constitution of life itself.\n\nI held that space was an apparition of God, and that soul was a\nprojection of the character of God; and when he called me his sweet\nmetaphysician, I called him my immortal materialist. And so we loved and\nwere happy; and I forgave him his materialism because of his tremendous\nwork in the world, performed without thought of soul-gain thereby, and\nbecause of his so exceeding modesty of spirit that prevented him from\nhaving pride and regal consciousness of himself and his soul.\n\nBut he had pride. How could he have been an eagle and not have pride?\nHis contention was that it was finer for a finite mortal speck of life\nto feel Godlike, than for a god to feel godlike; and so it was that he\nexalted what he deemed his mortality. He was fond of quoting a fragment\nfrom a certain poem. He had never seen the whole poem, and he had tried\nvainly to learn its authorship. I here give the fragment, not alone\nbecause he loved it, but because it epitomized the paradox that he was\nin the spirit of him, and his conception of his spirit. For how can a\nman, with thrilling, and burning, and exaltation, recite the following\nand still be mere mortal earth, a bit of fugitive force, an evanescent\nform? Here it is:\n\n     \"Joy upon joy and gain upon gain\n     Are the destined rights of my birth,\n     And I shout the praise of my endless days\n     To the echoing edge of the earth.\n     Though I suffer all deaths that a man can die\n     To the uttermost end of time,\n     I have deep-drained this, my cup of bliss,\n     In every age and clime--\n\n     \"The froth of Pride, the tang of Power,\n     The sweet of Womanhood!\n     I drain the lees upon my knees,\n     For oh, the draught is good;\n     I drink to Life, I drink to Death,\n     And smack my lips with song,\n     For when I die, another 'I' shall pass the cup along.\n\n     \"The man you drove from Eden's grove\n              Was I, my Lord, was I,\n     And I shall be there when the earth and the air\n              Are rent from sea to sky;\n     For it is my world, my gorgeous world,\n              The world of my dearest woes,\n     From the first faint cry of the newborn\n              To the rack of the woman's throes.\n\n     \"Packed with the pulse of an unborn race,\n     Torn with a world's desire,\n     The surging flood of my wild young blood\n     Would quench the judgment fire.\n     I am Man, Man, Man, from the tingling flesh\n     To the dust of my earthly goal,\n     From the nestling gloom of the pregnant womb\n     To the sheen of my naked soul.\n     Bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh\n     The whole world leaps to my will,\n     And the unslaked thirst of an Eden cursed\n     Shall harrow the earth for its fill.\n     Almighty God, when I drain life's glass\n     Of all its rainbow gleams,\n     The hapless plight of eternal night\n     Shall be none too long for my dreams.\n\n     \"The man you drove from Eden's grove\n              Was I, my Lord, was I,\n     And I shall be there when the earth and the air\n              Are rent from sea to sky;\n     For it is my world, my gorgeous world,\n              The world of my dear delight,\n     From the brightest gleam of the Arctic stream\n              To the dusk of my own love-night.\"\n\nErnest always overworked. His wonderful constitution kept him up; but\neven that constitution could not keep the tired look out of his eyes.\nHis dear, tired eyes! He never slept more than four and one-half hours\na night; yet he never found time to do all the work he wanted to do.\nHe never ceased from his activities as a propagandist, and was always\nscheduled long in advance for lectures to workingmen's organizations.\nThen there was the campaign. He did a man's full work in that alone.\nWith the suppression of the socialist publishing houses, his meagre\nroyalties ceased, and he was hard-put to make a living; for he had to\nmake a living in addition to all his other labor. He did a great deal\nof translating for the magazines on scientific and philosophic subjects;\nand, coming home late at night, worn out from the strain of the\ncampaign, he would plunge into his translating and toil on well into the\nmorning hours. And in addition to everything, there was his studying.\nTo the day of his death he kept up his studies, and he studied\nprodigiously.\n\nAnd yet he found time in which to love me and make me happy. But this\nwas accomplished only through my merging my life completely into his. I\nlearned shorthand and typewriting, and became his secretary. He insisted\nthat I succeeded in cutting his work in half; and so it was that I\nschooled myself to understand his work. Our interests became mutual, and\nwe worked together and played together.\n\nAnd then there were our sweet stolen moments in the midst of our\nwork--just a word, or caress, or flash of love-light; and our moments\nwere sweeter for being stolen. For we lived on the heights, where the\nair was keen and sparkling, where the toil was for humanity, and where\nsordidness and selfishness never entered. We loved love, and our love\nwas never smirched by anything less than the best. And this out of all\nremains: I did not fail. I gave him rest--he who worked so hard for\nothers, my dear, tired-eyed mortalist.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE BISHOP\n\n\nIt was after my marriage that I chanced upon Bishop Morehouse. But I\nmust give the events in their proper sequence. After his outbreak at the\nI. P. H. Convention, the Bishop, being a gentle soul, had yielded to\nthe friendly pressure brought to bear upon him, and had gone away on a\nvacation. But he returned more fixed than ever in his determination\nto preach the message of the Church. To the consternation of his\ncongregation, his first sermon was quite similar to the address he\nhad given before the Convention. Again he said, and at length and with\ndistressing detail, that the Church had wandered away from the Master's\nteaching, and that Mammon had been instated in the place of Christ.\n\nAnd the result was, willy-nilly, that he was led away to a private\nsanitarium for mental disease, while in the newspapers appeared\npathetic accounts of his mental breakdown and of the saintliness of\nhis character. He was held a prisoner in the sanitarium. I called\nrepeatedly, but was denied access to him; and I was terribly impressed\nby the tragedy of a sane, normal, saintly man being crushed by the\nbrutal will of society. For the Bishop was sane, and pure, and noble. As\nErnest said, all that was the matter with him was that he had incorrect\nnotions of biology and sociology, and because of his incorrect notions\nhe had not gone about it in the right way to rectify matters.\n\nWhat terrified me was the Bishop's helplessness. If he persisted in the\ntruth as he saw it, he was doomed to an insane ward. And he could do\nnothing. His money, his position, his culture, could not save him. His\nviews were perilous to society, and society could not conceive that such\nperilous views could be the product of a sane mind. Or, at least, it\nseems to me that such was society's attitude.\n\nBut the Bishop, in spite of the gentleness and purity of his spirit, was\npossessed of guile. He apprehended clearly his danger. He saw himself\ncaught in the web, and he tried to escape from it. Denied help from his\nfriends, such as father and Ernest and I could have given, he was\nleft to battle for himself alone. And in the enforced solitude of the\nsanitarium he recovered. He became again sane. His eyes ceased to see\nvisions; his brain was purged of the fancy that it was the duty of\nsociety to feed the Master's lambs.\n\nAs I say, he became well, quite well, and the newspapers and the church\npeople hailed his return with joy. I went once to his church. The sermon\nwas of the same order as the ones he had preached long before his eyes\nhad seen visions. I was disappointed, shocked. Had society then beaten\nhim into submission? Was he a coward? Had he been bulldozed into\nrecanting? Or had the strain been too great for him, and had he meekly\nsurrendered to the juggernaut of the established?\n\nI called upon him in his beautiful home. He was woefully changed. He was\nthinner, and there were lines on his face which I had never seen before.\nHe was manifestly distressed by my coming. He plucked nervously at his\nsleeve as we talked; and his eyes were restless, fluttering here, there,\nand everywhere, and refusing to meet mine. His mind seemed preoccupied,\nand there were strange pauses in his conversation, abrupt changes of\ntopic, and an inconsecutiveness that was bewildering. Could this, then,\nbe the firm-poised, Christ-like man I had known, with pure, limpid eyes\nand a gaze steady and unfaltering as his soul? He had been man-handled;\nhe had been cowed into subjection. His spirit was too gentle. It had not\nbeen mighty enough to face the organized wolf-pack of society.\n\nI felt sad, unutterably sad. He talked ambiguously, and was so\napprehensive of what I might say that I had not the heart to catechise\nhim. He spoke in a far-away manner of his illness, and we talked\ndisjointedly about the church, the alterations in the organ, and about\npetty charities; and he saw me depart with such evident relief that I\nshould have laughed had not my heart been so full of tears.\n\nThe poor little hero! If I had only known! He was battling like a giant,\nand I did not guess it. Alone, all alone, in the midst of millions of\nhis fellow-men, he was fighting his fight. Torn by his horror of the\nasylum and his fidelity to truth and the right, he clung steadfastly to\ntruth and the right; but so alone was he that he did not dare to trust\neven me. He had learned his lesson well--too well.\n\nBut I was soon to know. One day the Bishop disappeared. He had told\nnobody that he was going away; and as the days went by and he did not\nreappear, there was much gossip to the effect that he had committed\nsuicide while temporarily deranged. But this idea was dispelled when it\nwas learned that he had sold all his possessions,--his city mansion, his\ncountry house at Menlo Park, his paintings, and collections, and even\nhis cherished library. It was patent that he had made a clean and secret\nsweep of everything before he disappeared.\n\nThis happened during the time when calamity had overtaken us in our own\naffairs; and it was not till we were well settled in our new home that\nwe had opportunity really to wonder and speculate about the Bishop's\ndoings. And then, everything was suddenly made clear. Early one evening,\nwhile it was yet twilight, I had run across the street and into the\nbutcher-shop to get some chops for Ernest's supper. We called the last\nmeal of the day \"supper\" in our new environment.\n\nJust at the moment I came out of the butcher-shop, a man emerged from\nthe corner grocery that stood alongside. A queer sense familiarity made\nme look again. But the man had turned and was walking rapidly away.\nThere was something about the slope of the shoulders and the fringe\nof silver hair between coat collar and slouch hat that aroused vague\nmemories. Instead of crossing the street, I hurried after the man. I\nquickened my pace, trying not to think the thoughts that formed unbidden\nin my brain. No, it was impossible. It could not be--not in those faded\noveralls, too long in the legs and frayed at the bottoms.\n\nI paused, laughed at myself, and almost abandoned the chase. But the\nhaunting familiarity of those shoulders and that silver hair! Again\nI hurried on. As I passed him, I shot a keen look at his face; then I\nwhirled around abruptly and confronted--the Bishop.\n\nHe halted with equal abruptness, and gasped. A large paper bag in his\nright hand fell to the sidewalk. It burst, and about his feet and mine\nbounced and rolled a flood of potatoes. He looked at me with surprise\nand alarm, then he seemed to wilt away; the shoulders drooped with\ndejection, and he uttered a deep sigh.\n\nI held out my hand. He shook it, but his hand felt clammy. He cleared\nhis throat in embarrassment, and I could see the sweat starting out on\nhis forehead. It was evident that he was badly frightened.\n\n\"The potatoes,\" he murmured faintly. \"They are precious.\"\n\nBetween us we picked them up and replaced them in the broken bag, which\nhe now held carefully in the hollow of his arm. I tried to tell him my\ngladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me.\n\n\"Father will be rejoiced to see you,\" I said. \"We live only a stone's\nthrow away.\n\n\"I can't,\" he said, \"I must be going. Good-by.\"\n\nHe looked apprehensively about him, as though dreading discovery, and\nmade an attempt to walk on.\n\n\"Tell me where you live, and I shall call later,\" he said, when he saw\nthat I walked beside him and that it was my intention to stick to him\nnow that he was found.\n\n\"No,\" I answered firmly. \"You must come now.\"\n\nHe looked at the potatoes spilling on his arm, and at the small parcels\non his other arm.\n\n\"Really, it is impossible,\" he said. \"Forgive me for my rudeness. If you\nonly knew.\"\n\nHe looked as if he were going to break down, but the next moment he had\nhimself in control.\n\n\"Besides, this food,\" he went on. \"It is a sad case. It is terrible. She\nis an old woman. I must take it to her at once. She is suffering from\nwant of it. I must go at once. You understand. Then I will return. I\npromise you.\"\n\n\"Let me go with you,\" I volunteered. \"Is it far?\"\n\nHe sighed again, and surrendered.\n\n\"Only two blocks,\" he said. \"Let us hasten.\"\n\nUnder the Bishop's guidance I learned something of my own neighborhood.\nI had not dreamed such wretchedness and misery existed in it. Of course,\nthis was because I did not concern myself with charity. I had become\nconvinced that Ernest was right when he sneered at charity as a\npoulticing of an ulcer. Remove the ulcer, was his remedy; give to the\nworker his product; pension as soldiers those who grow honorably old in\ntheir toil, and there will be no need for charity. Convinced of this,\nI toiled with him at the revolution, and did not exhaust my energy in\nalleviating the social ills that continuously arose from the injustice\nof the system.\n\nI followed the Bishop into a small room, ten by twelve, in a rear\ntenement. And there we found a little old German woman--sixty-four years\nold, the Bishop said. She was surprised at seeing me, but she nodded a\npleasant greeting and went on sewing on the pair of men's trousers in\nher lap. Beside her, on the floor, was a pile of trousers. The Bishop\ndiscovered there was neither coal nor kindling, and went out to buy\nsome.\n\nI took up a pair of trousers and examined her work.\n\n\"Six cents, lady,\" she said, nodding her head gently while she went on\nstitching. She stitched slowly, but never did she cease from stitching.\nShe seemed mastered by the verb \"to stitch.\"\n\n\"For all that work?\" I asked. \"Is that what they pay? How long does it\ntake you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"that is what they pay. Six cents for finishing.\nTwo hours' sewing on each pair.\"\n\n\"But the boss doesn't know that,\" she added quickly, betraying a fear\nof getting him into trouble. \"I'm slow. I've got the rheumatism in my\nhands. Girls work much faster. They finish in half that time. The boss\nis kind. He lets me take the work home, now that I am old and the noise\nof the machine bothers my head. If it wasn't for his kindness, I'd\nstarve.\n\n\"Yes, those who work in the shop get eight cents. But what can you do?\nThere is not enough work for the young. The old have no chance. Often\none pair is all I can get. Sometimes, like to-day, I am given eight pair\nto finish before night.\"\n\nI asked her the hours she worked, and she said it depended on the\nseason.\n\n\"In the summer, when there is a rush order, I work from five in the\nmorning to nine at night. But in the winter it is too cold. The hands do\nnot early get over the stiffness. Then you must work later--till after\nmidnight sometimes.\n\n\"Yes, it has been a bad summer. The hard times. God must be angry.\nThis is the first work the boss has given me in a week. It is true, one\ncannot eat much when there is no work. I am used to it. I have sewed\nall my life, in the old country and here in San Francisco--thirty-three\nyears.\n\n\"If you are sure of the rent, it is all right. The houseman is very\nkind, but he must have his rent. It is fair. He only charges three\ndollars for this room. That is cheap. But it is not easy for you to find\nall of three dollars every month.\"\n\nShe ceased talking, and, nodding her head, went on stitching.\n\n\"You have to be very careful as to how you spend your earnings,\" I\nsuggested.\n\nShe nodded emphatically.\n\n\"After the rent it's not so bad. Of course you can't buy meat. And there\nis no milk for the coffee. But always there is one meal a day, and often\ntwo.\"\n\nShe said this last proudly. There was a smack of success in her words.\nBut as she stitched on in silence, I noticed the sadness in her pleasant\neyes and the droop of her mouth. The look in her eyes became far away.\nShe rubbed the dimness hastily out of them; it interfered with her\nstitching.\n\n\"No, it is not the hunger that makes the heart ache,\" she explained.\n\"You get used to being hungry. It is for my child that I cry. It was\nthe machine that killed her. It is true she worked hard, but I cannot\nunderstand. She was strong. And she was young--only forty; and she\nworked only thirty years. She began young, it is true; but my man died.\nThe boiler exploded down at the works. And what were we to do? She was\nten, but she was very strong. But the machine killed her. Yes, it\ndid. It killed her, and she was the fastest worker in the shop. I have\nthought about it often, and I know. That is why I cannot work in the\nshop. The machine bothers my head. Always I hear it saying, 'I did it, I\ndid it.' And it says that all day long. And then I think of my daughter,\nand I cannot work.\"\n\nThe moistness was in her old eyes again, and she had to wipe it away\nbefore she could go on stitching.\n\nI heard the Bishop stumbling up the stairs, and I opened the door. What\na spectacle he was. On his back he carried half a sack of coal, with\nkindling on top. Some of the coal dust had coated his face, and the\nsweat from his exertions was running in streaks. He dropped his burden\nin the corner by the stove and wiped his face on a coarse bandana\nhandkerchief. I could scarcely accept the verdict of my senses. The\nBishop, black as a coal-heaver, in a workingman's cheap cotton shirt\n(one button was missing from the throat), and in overalls! That was the\nmost incongruous of all--the overalls, frayed at the bottoms, dragged\ndown at the heels, and held up by a narrow leather belt around the hips\nsuch as laborers wear.\n\nThough the Bishop was warm, the poor swollen hands of the old woman were\nalready cramping with the cold; and before we left her, the Bishop had\nbuilt the fire, while I had peeled the potatoes and put them on to boil.\nI was to learn, as time went by, that there were many cases similar\nto hers, and many worse, hidden away in the monstrous depths of the\ntenements in my neighborhood.\n\nWe got back to find Ernest alarmed by my absence. After the first\nsurprise of greeting was over, the Bishop leaned back in his chair,\nstretched out his overall-covered legs, and actually sighed a\ncomfortable sigh. We were the first of his old friends he had met since\nhis disappearance, he told us; and during the intervening weeks he must\nhave suffered greatly from loneliness. He told us much, though he told\nus more of the joy he had experienced in doing the Master's bidding.\n\n\"For truly now,\" he said, \"I am feeding his lambs. And I have learned\na great lesson. The soul cannot be ministered to till the stomach is\nappeased. His lambs must be fed bread and butter and potatoes and\nmeat; after that, and only after that, are their spirits ready for more\nrefined nourishment.\"\n\nHe ate heartily of the supper I cooked. Never had he had such an\nappetite at our table in the old days. We spoke of it, and he said that\nhe had never been so healthy in his life.\n\n\"I walk always now,\" he said, and a blush was on his cheek at the\nthought of the time when he rode in his carriage, as though it were a\nsin not lightly to be laid.\n\n\"My health is better for it,\" he added hastily. \"And I am very\nhappy--indeed, most happy. At last I am a consecrated spirit.\"\n\nAnd yet there was in his face a permanent pain, the pain of the world\nthat he was now taking to himself. He was seeing life in the raw, and it\nwas a different life from what he had known within the printed books of\nhis library.\n\n\"And you are responsible for all this, young man,\" he said directly to\nErnest.\n\nErnest was embarrassed and awkward.\n\n\"I--I warned you,\" he faltered.\n\n\"No, you misunderstand,\" the Bishop answered. \"I speak not in reproach,\nbut in gratitude. I have you to thank for showing me my path. You led me\nfrom theories about life to life itself. You pulled aside the veils from\nthe social shams. You were light in my darkness, but now I, too, see the\nlight. And I am very happy, only . . .\" he hesitated painfully, and in\nhis eyes fear leaped large. \"Only the persecution. I harm no one. Why\nwill they not let me alone? But it is not that. It is the nature of\nthe persecution. I shouldn't mind if they cut my flesh with stripes, or\nburned me at the stake, or crucified me head--downward. But it is the\nasylum that frightens me. Think of it! Of me--in an asylum for the\ninsane! It is revolting. I saw some of the cases at the sanitarium. They\nwere violent. My blood chills when I think of it. And to be imprisoned\nfor the rest of my life amid scenes of screaming madness! No! no! Not\nthat! Not that!\"\n\nIt was pitiful. His hands shook, his whole body quivered and shrank away\nfrom the picture he had conjured. But the next moment he was calm.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said simply. \"It is my wretched nerves. And if the\nMaster's work leads there, so be it. Who am I to complain?\"\n\nI felt like crying aloud as I looked at him: \"Great Bishop! O hero!\nGod's hero!\"\n\nAs the evening wore on we learned more of his doings.\n\n\"I sold my house--my houses, rather,\" he said, \"all my other possessions.\nI knew I must do it secretly, else they would have taken everything away\nfrom me. That would have been terrible. I often marvel these days at the\nimmense quantity of potatoes two or three hundred thousand dollars will\nbuy, or bread, or meat, or coal and kindling.\" He turned to Ernest. \"You\nare right, young man. Labor is dreadfully underpaid. I never did a\nbit of work in my life, except to appeal aesthetically to Pharisees--I\nthought I was preaching the message--and yet I was worth half a million\ndollars. I never knew what half a million dollars meant until I realized\nhow much potatoes and bread and butter and meat it could buy. And then\nI realized something more. I realized that all those potatoes and that\nbread and butter and meat were mine, and that I had not worked to make\nthem. Then it was clear to me, some one else had worked and made them\nand been robbed of them. And when I came down amongst the poor I found\nthose who had been robbed and who were hungry and wretched because they\nhad been robbed.\"\n\nWe drew him back to his narrative.\n\n\"The money? I have it deposited in many different banks under different\nnames. It can never be taken away from me, because it can never be\nfound. And it is so good, that money. It buys so much food. I never knew\nbefore what money was good for.\"\n\n\"I wish we could get some of it for the propaganda,\" Ernest said\nwistfully. \"It would do immense good.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" the Bishop said. \"I do not have much faith in\npolitics. In fact, I am afraid I do not understand politics.\"\n\nErnest was delicate in such matters. He did not repeat his suggestion,\nthough he knew only too well the sore straits the Socialist Party was in\nthrough lack of money.\n\n\"I sleep in cheap lodging houses,\" the Bishop went on. \"But I am afraid,\nand never stay long in one place. Also, I rent two rooms in workingmen's\nhouses in different quarters of the city. It is a great extravagance,\nI know, but it is necessary. I make up for it in part by doing my own\ncooking, though sometimes I get something to eat in cheap coffee-houses.\nAnd I have made a discovery. Tamales* are very good when the air grows\nchilly late at night. Only they are so expensive. But I have discovered\na place where I can get three for ten cents. They are not so good as the\nothers, but they are very warming.\n\n     * A Mexican dish, referred to occasionally in the literature\n     of the times.  It is supposed that it was warmly seasoned.\n     No recipe of it has come down to us.\n\n\"And so I have at last found my work in the world, thanks to you, young\nman. It is the Master's work.\" He looked at me, and his eyes twinkled.\n\"You caught me feeding his lambs, you know. And of course you will all\nkeep my secret.\"\n\nHe spoke carelessly enough, but there was real fear behind the speech.\nHe promised to call upon us again. But a week later we read in the\nnewspaper of the sad case of Bishop Morehouse, who had been committed to\nthe Napa Asylum and for whom there were still hopes held out. In vain\nwe tried to see him, to have his case reconsidered or investigated. Nor\ncould we learn anything about him except the reiterated statements that\nslight hopes were still held for his recovery.\n\n\"Christ told the rich young man to sell all he had,\" Ernest said\nbitterly. \"The Bishop obeyed Christ's injunction and got locked up in a\nmadhouse. Times have changed since Christ's day. A rich man to-day who\ngives all he has to the poor is crazy. There is no discussion. Society\nhas spoken.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE GENERAL STRIKE\n\n\nOf course Ernest was elected to Congress in the great socialist\nlandslide that took place in the fall of 1912. One great factor that\nhelped to swell the socialist vote was the destruction of Hearst.*\nThis the Plutocracy found an easy task. It cost Hearst eighteen million\ndollars a year to run his various papers, and this sum, and more, he got\nback from the middle class in payment for advertising. The source of his\nfinancial strength lay wholly in the middle class. The trusts did not\nadvertise.** To destroy Hearst, all that was necessary was to take away\nfrom him his advertising.\n\n     * William Randolph Hearst--a young California millionaire\n     who became the most powerful newspaper owner in the country.\n     His newspapers were published in all the large cities, and\n     they appealed to the perishing middle class and to the\n     proletariat.  So large was his following that he managed to\n     take possession of the empty shell of the old Democratic\n     Party.  He occupied an anomalous position, preaching an\n     emasculated socialism combined with a nondescript sort of\n     petty bourgeois capitalism.  It was oil and water, and there\n     was no hope for him, though for a short period he was a\n     source of serious apprehension to the Plutocrats.\n\n     ** The cost of advertising was amazing in those helter-\n     skelter times.  Only the small capitalists competed, and\n     therefore they did the advertising.  There being no\n     competition where there was a trust, there was no need for\n     the trusts to advertise.\n\nThe whole middle class had not yet been exterminated. The sturdy\nskeleton of it remained; but it was without power. The small\nmanufacturers and small business men who still survived were at the\ncomplete mercy of the Plutocracy. They had no economic nor political\nsouls of their own. When the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth, they\nwithdrew their advertisements from the Hearst papers.\n\nHearst made a gallant fight. He brought his papers out at a loss of\na million and a half each month. He continued to publish the\nadvertisements for which he no longer received pay. Again the fiat of\nthe Plutocracy went forth, and the small business men and manufacturers\nswamped him with a flood of notices that he must discontinue running\ntheir old advertisements. Hearst persisted. Injunctions were served\non him. Still he persisted. He received six months' imprisonment for\ncontempt of court in disobeying the injunctions, while he was bankrupted\nby countless damage suits. He had no chance. The Plutocracy had passed\nsentence on him. The courts were in the hands of the Plutocracy to\ncarry the sentence out. And with Hearst crashed also to destruction the\nDemocratic Party that he had so recently captured.\n\nWith the destruction of Hearst and the Democratic Party, there were only\ntwo paths for his following to take. One was into the Socialist Party;\nthe other was into the Republican Party. Then it was that we socialists\nreaped the fruit of Hearst's pseudo-socialistic preaching; for the great\nMajority of his followers came over to us.\n\nThe expropriation of the farmers that took place at this time would also\nhave swelled our vote had it not been for the brief and futile rise of\nthe Grange Party. Ernest and the socialist leaders fought fiercely to\ncapture the farmers; but the destruction of the socialist press\nand publishing houses constituted too great a handicap, while the\nmouth-to-mouth propaganda had not yet been perfected. So it was that\npoliticians like Mr. Calvin, who were themselves farmers long since\nexpropriated, captured the farmers and threw their political strength\naway in a vain campaign.\n\n\"The poor farmers,\" Ernest once laughed savagely; \"the trusts have them\nboth coming and going.\"\n\nAnd that was really the situation. The seven great trusts, working\ntogether, had pooled their enormous surpluses and made a farm trust.\nThe railroads, controlling rates, and the bankers and stock exchange\ngamesters, controlling prices, had long since bled the farmers into\nindebtedness. The bankers, and all the trusts for that matter, had\nlikewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers. The\nfarmers were in the net. All that remained to be done was the drawing in\nof the net. This the farm trust proceeded to do.\n\nThe hard times of 1912 had already caused a frightful slump in the farm\nmarkets. Prices were now deliberately pressed down to bankruptcy,\nwhile the railroads, with extortionate rates, broke the back of the\nfarmer-camel. Thus the farmers were compelled to borrow more and more,\nwhile they were prevented from paying back old loans. Then ensued the\ngreat foreclosing of mortgages and enforced collection of notes. The\nfarmers simply surrendered the land to the farm trust. There was nothing\nelse for them to do. And having surrendered the land, the farmers next\nwent to work for the farm trust, becoming managers, superintendents,\nforemen, and common laborers. They worked for wages. They became\nvilleins, in short--serfs bound to the soil by a living wage. They could\nnot leave their masters, for their masters composed the Plutocracy.\nThey could not go to the cities, for there, also, the Plutocracy was\nin control. They had but one alternative,--to leave the soil and become\nvagrants, in brief, to starve. And even there they were frustrated, for\nstringent vagrancy laws were passed and rigidly enforced.\n\nOf course, here and there, farmers, and even whole communities of\nfarmers, escaped expropriation by virtue of exceptional conditions. But\nthey were merely strays and did not count, and they were gathered in\nanyway during the following year.*\n\n     * The destruction of the Roman yeomanry proceeded far less\n     rapidly than the destruction of the American farmers and\n     small capitalists. There was momentum in the twentieth\n     century, while there was practically none in ancient Rome.\n\n     Numbers of the farmers, impelled by an insane lust for the\n     soil, and willing to show what beasts they could become,\n     tried to escape expropriation by withdrawing from any and\n     all market-dealing.  They sold nothing.  They bought\n     nothing.  Among themselves a primitive barter began to\n     spring up.  Their privation and hardships were terrible, but\n     they persisted.  It became quite a movement, in fact. The\n     manner in which they were beaten was unique and logical and\n     simple.  The Plutocracy, by virtue of its possession of the\n     government, raised their taxes.  It was the weak joint in\n     their armor.  Neither buying nor selling, they had no money,\n     and in the end their land was sold to pay the taxes.\n\nThus it was that in the fall of 1912 the socialist leaders, with the\nexception of Ernest, decided that the end of capitalism had come. What\nof the hard times and the consequent vast army of the unemployed; what\nof the destruction of the farmers and the middle class; and what of the\ndecisive defeat administered all along the line to the labor unions; the\nsocialists were really justified in believing that the end of capitalism\nhad come and in themselves throwing down the gauntlet to the Plutocracy.\n\nAlas, how we underestimated the strength of the enemy! Everywhere the\nsocialists proclaimed their coming victory at the ballot-box, while, in\nunmistakable terms, they stated the situation. The Plutocracy accepted\nthe challenge. It was the Plutocracy, weighing and balancing, that\ndefeated us by dividing our strength. It was the Plutocracy, through its\nsecret agents, that raised the cry that socialism was sacrilegious\nand atheistic; it was the Plutocracy that whipped the churches, and\nespecially the Catholic Church, into line, and robbed us of a portion of\nthe labor vote. And it was the Plutocracy, through its secret agents\nof course, that encouraged the Grange Party and even spread it to the\ncities into the ranks of the dying middle class.\n\nNevertheless the socialist landslide occurred. But, instead of a\nsweeping victory with chief executive officers and majorities in all\nlegislative bodies, we found ourselves in the minority. It is true, we\nelected fifty Congressmen; but when they took their seats in the spring\nof 1913, they found themselves without power of any sort. Yet they\nwere more fortunate than the Grangers, who captured a dozen state\ngovernments, and who, in the spring, were not permitted to take\npossession of the captured offices. The incumbents refused to retire,\nand the courts were in the hands of the Oligarchy. But this is too far\nin advance of events. I have yet to tell of the stirring times of the\nwinter of 1912.\n\nThe hard times at home had caused an immense decrease in consumption.\nLabor, out of work, had no wages with which to buy. The result was that\nthe Plutocracy found a greater surplus than ever on its hands. This\nsurplus it was compelled to dispose of abroad, and, what of its colossal\nplans, it needed money. Because of its strenuous efforts to dispose of\nthe surplus in the world market, the Plutocracy clashed with Germany.\nEconomic clashes were usually succeeded by wars, and this particular\nclash was no exception. The great German war-lord prepared, and so did\nthe United States prepare.\n\nThe war-cloud hovered dark and ominous. The stage was set for a\nworld-catastrophe, for in all the world were hard times, labor troubles,\nperishing middle classes, armies of unemployed, clashes of economic\ninterests in the world-market, and mutterings and rumblings of the\nsocialist revolution.*\n\n     * For a long time these mutterings and rumblings had been\n     heard. As far back as 1906 A.D., Lord Avebury, an\n     Englishman, uttered the following in the House of Lords:\n     \"The unrest in Europe, the spread of socialism, and the\n     ominous rise of Anarchism, are warnings to the governments\n     and the ruling classes that the condition of the working\n     classes in Europe is becoming intolerable, and that if a\n     revolution is to be avoided some steps must be taken to\n     increase wages, reduce the hours of labor, and lower the\n     prices of the necessaries of life.\"  The Wall Street\n     Journal, a stock gamesters' publication, in commenting upon\n     Lord Avebury's speech, said: \"These words were spoken by an\n     aristocrat and a member of the most conservative body in all\n     Europe.  That gives them all the more significance.  They\n     contain more valuable political economy than is to be found\n     in most of the books.  They sound a note of warning. Take\n     heed, gentlemen of the war and navy departments!\"\n\n     At the same time, Sydney Brooks, writing in America, in\n     Harper's Weekly, said: \"You will not hear the socialists\n     mentioned in Washington.  Why should you?  The politicians\n     are always the last people in this country to see what is\n     going on under their noses. They will jeer at me when I\n     prophesy, and prophesy with the utmost confidence, that at\n     the next presidential election the socialists will poll over\n     a million votes.\"\n\nThe Oligarchy wanted the war with Germany. And it wanted the war for a\ndozen reasons. In the juggling of events such a war would cause, in the\nreshuffling of the international cards and the making of new treaties\nand alliances, the Oligarchy had much to gain. And, furthermore, the war\nwould consume many national surpluses, reduce the armies of unemployed\nthat menaced all countries, and give the Oligarchy a breathing space\nin which to perfect its plans and carry them out. Such a war would\nvirtually put the Oligarchy in possession of the world-market. Also,\nsuch a war would create a large standing army that need never be\ndisbanded, while in the minds of the people would be substituted\nthe issue, \"America versus Germany,\" in place of \"Socialism versus\nOligarchy.\"\n\nAnd truly the war would have done all these things had it not been for\nthe socialists. A secret meeting of the Western leaders was held in our\nfour tiny rooms in Pell Street. Here was first considered the stand the\nsocialists were to take. It was not the first time we had put our foot\ndown upon war,* but it was the first time we had done so in the United\nStates. After our secret meeting we got in touch with the national\norganization, and soon our code cables were passing back and forth\nacross the Atlantic between us and the International Bureau.\n\n     * It was at the very beginning of the twentieth century\n     A.D., that the international organization of the socialists\n     finally formulated their long-maturing policy on war.\n     Epitomized their doctrine was: \"Why should the workingmen of\n     one country fight with the workingmen of another country for\n     the benefit of their capitalist masters?\"\n\n     On May 21, 1905 A.D., when war threatened between Austria\n     and Italy, the socialists of Italy, Austria, and Hungary\n     held a conference at Trieste, and threatened a general\n     strike of the workingmen of both countries in case war was\n     declared.  This was repeated the following year, when the\n     \"Morocco Affair\" threatened to involve France, Germany, and\n     England.\n\nThe German socialists were ready to act with us. There were over five\nmillion of them, many of them in the standing army, and, in addition,\nthey were on friendly terms with the labor unions. In both countries the\nsocialists came out in bold declaration against the war and threatened\nthe general strike. And in the meantime they made preparation for the\ngeneral strike. Furthermore, the revolutionary parties in all countries\ngave public utterance to the socialist principle of international peace\nthat must be preserved at all hazards, even to the extent of revolt and\nrevolution at home.\n\nThe general strike was the one great victory we American socialists\nwon. On the 4th of December the American minister was withdrawn from\nthe German capital. That night a German fleet made a dash on Honolulu,\nsinking three American cruisers and a revenue cutter, and bombarding\nthe city. Next day both Germany and the United States declared war,\nand within an hour the socialists called the general strike in both\ncountries.\n\nFor the first time the German war-lord faced the men of his empire\nwho made his empire go. Without them he could not run his empire. The\nnovelty of the situation lay in that their revolt was passive. They\ndid not fight. They did nothing. And by doing nothing they tied their\nwar-lord's hands. He would have asked for nothing better than an\nopportunity to loose his war-dogs on his rebellious proletariat. But\nthis was denied him. He could not loose his war-dogs. Neither could\nhe mobilize his army to go forth to war, nor could he punish his\nrecalcitrant subjects. Not a wheel moved in his empire. Not a train ran,\nnot a telegraphic message went over the wires, for the telegraphers and\nrailroad men had ceased work along with the rest of the population.\n\nAnd as it was in Germany, so it was in the United States. At last\norganized labor had learned its lesson. Beaten decisively on its own\nchosen field, it had abandoned that field and come over to the political\nfield of the socialists; for the general strike was a political strike.\nBesides, organized labor had been so badly beaten that it did not care.\nIt joined in the general strike out of sheer desperation. The workers\nthrew down their tools and left their tasks by the millions. Especially\nnotable were the machinists. Their heads were bloody, their organization\nhad apparently been destroyed, yet out they came, along with their\nallies in the metal-working trades.\n\nEven the common laborers and all unorganized labor ceased work. The\nstrike had tied everything up so that nobody could work. Besides, the\nwomen proved to be the strongest promoters of the strike. They set their\nfaces against the war. They did not want their men to go forth to\ndie. Then, also, the idea of the general strike caught the mood of the\npeople. It struck their sense of humor. The idea was infectious. The\nchildren struck in all the schools, and such teachers as came, went home\nagain from deserted class rooms. The general strike took the form of\na great national picnic. And the idea of the solidarity of labor, so\nevidenced, appealed to the imagination of all. And, finally, there was\nno danger to be incurred by the colossal frolic. When everybody was\nguilty, how was anybody to be punished?\n\nThe United States was paralyzed. No one knew what was happening. There\nwere no newspapers, no letters, no despatches. Every community was as\ncompletely isolated as though ten thousand miles of primeval wilderness\nstretched between it and the rest of the world. For that matter, the\nworld had ceased to exist. And for a week this state of affairs was\nmaintained.\n\nIn San Francisco we did not know what was happening even across the bay\nin Oakland or Berkeley. The effect on one's sensibilities was weird,\ndepressing. It seemed as though some great cosmic thing lay dead. The\npulse of the land had ceased to beat. Of a truth the nation had died.\nThere were no wagons rumbling on the streets, no factory whistles, no\nhum of electricity in the air, no passing of street cars, no cries\nof news-boys--nothing but persons who at rare intervals went by like\nfurtive ghosts, themselves oppressed and made unreal by the silence.\n\nAnd during that week of silence the Oligarchy was taught its lesson. And\nwell it learned the lesson. The general strike was a warning. It should\nnever occur again. The Oligarchy would see to that.\n\nAt the end of the week, as had been prearranged, the telegraphers of\nGermany and the United States returned to their posts. Through them the\nsocialist leaders of both countries presented their ultimatum to the\nrulers. The war should be called off, or the general strike would\ncontinue. It did not take long to come to an understanding. The war was\ndeclared off, and the populations of both countries returned to their\ntasks.\n\nIt was this renewal of peace that brought about the alliance between\nGermany and the United States. In reality, this was an alliance between\nthe Emperor and the Oligarchy, for the purpose of meeting their common\nfoe, the revolutionary proletariat of both countries. And it was this\nalliance that the Oligarchy afterward so treacherously broke when the\nGerman socialists rose and drove the war-lord from his throne. It was\nthe very thing the Oligarchy had played for--the destruction of its\ngreat rival in the world-market. With the German Emperor out of the way,\nGermany would have no surplus to sell abroad. By the very nature of\nthe socialist state, the German population would consume all that it\nproduced. Of course, it would trade abroad certain things it produced\nfor things it did not produce; but this would be quite different from an\nunconsumable surplus.\n\n\"I'll wager the Oligarchy finds justification,\" Ernest said, when its\ntreachery to the German Emperor became known. \"As usual, the Oligarchy\nwill believe it has done right.\"\n\nAnd sure enough. The Oligarchy's public defence for the act was that it\nhad done it for the sake of the American people whose interests it was\nlooking out for. It had flung its hated rival out of the world-market\nand enabled us to dispose of our surplus in that market.\n\n\"And the howling folly of it is that we are so helpless that such idiots\nreally are managing our interests,\" was Ernest's comment. \"They have\nenabled us to sell more abroad, which means that we'll be compelled to\nconsume less at home.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE END\n\n\nAs early as January, 1913, Ernest saw the true trend of affairs, but\nhe could not get his brother leaders to see the vision of the Iron\nHeel that had arisen in his brain. They were too confident. Events were\nrushing too rapidly to culmination. A crisis had come in world\naffairs. The American Oligarchy was practically in possession of the\nworld-market, and scores of countries were flung out of that market with\nunconsumable and unsalable surpluses on their hands. For such countries\nnothing remained but reorganization. They could not continue their\nmethod of producing surpluses. The capitalistic system, so far as they\nwere concerned, had hopelessly broken down.\n\nThe reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution.\nIt was a time of confusion and violence. Everywhere institutions and\ngovernments were crashing. Everywhere, with the exception of two or\nthree countries, the erstwhile capitalist masters fought bitterly for\ntheir possessions. But the governments were taken away from them by the\nmilitant proletariat. At last was being realized Karl Marx's classic:\n\"The knell of private capitalist property sounds. The expropriators\nare expropriated.\" And as fast as capitalistic governments crashed,\ncooperative commonwealths arose in their place.\n\n\"Why does the United States lag behind?\"; \"Get busy, you American\nrevolutionists!\"; \"What's the matter with America?\"--were the messages\nsent to us by our successful comrades in other lands. But we could not\nkeep up. The Oligarchy stood in the way. Its bulk, like that of some\nhuge monster, blocked our path.\n\n\"Wait till we take office in the spring,\" we answered. \"Then you'll\nsee.\"\n\nBehind this lay our secret. We had won over the Grangers, and in the\nspring a dozen states would pass into their hands by virtue of the\nelections of the preceding fall. At once would be instituted a dozen\ncooperative commonwealth states. After that, the rest would be easy.\n\n\"But what if the Grangers fail to get possession?\" Ernest demanded. And\nhis comrades called him a calamity howler.\n\nBut this failure to get possession was not the chief danger that Ernest\nhad in mind. What he foresaw was the defection of the great labor unions\nand the rise of the castes.\n\n\"Ghent has taught the oligarchs how to do it,\" Ernest said. \"I'll wager\nthey've made a text-book out of his 'Benevolent Feudalism.'\"*\n\n     * \"Our Benevolent Feudalism,\" a book published in 1902 A.D.,\n     by W. J. Ghent.  It has always been insisted that Ghent put\n     the idea of the Oligarchy into the minds of the great\n     capitalists.  This belief persists throughout the literature\n     of the three centuries of the Iron Heel, and even in the\n     literature of the first century of the Brotherhood of Man.\n     To-day we know better, but our knowledge does not overcome\n     the fact that Ghent remains the most abused innocent man in\n     all history.\n\nNever shall I forget the night when, after a hot discussion with half a\ndozen labor leaders, Ernest turned to me and said quietly: \"That settles\nit. The Iron Heel has won. The end is in sight.\"\n\nThis little conference in our home was unofficial; but Ernest, like the\nrest of his comrades, was working for assurances from the labor leaders\nthat they would call out their men in the next general strike. O'Connor,\nthe president of the Association of Machinists, had been foremost of the\nsix leaders present in refusing to give such assurance.\n\n\"You have seen that you were beaten soundly at your old tactics of\nstrike and boycott,\" Ernest urged.\n\nO'Connor and the others nodded their heads.\n\n\"And you saw what a general strike would do,\" Ernest went on. \"We\nstopped the war with Germany. Never was there so fine a display of the\nsolidarity and the power of labor. Labor can and will rule the world.\nIf you continue to stand with us, we'll put an end to the reign of\ncapitalism. It is your only hope. And what is more, you know it. There\nis no other way out. No matter what you do under your old tactics, you\nare doomed to defeat, if for no other reason because the masters control\nthe courts.\"*\n\n     * As a sample of the decisions of the courts adverse to\n     labor, the following instances are given.  In the coal-\n     mining regions the employment of children was notorious.  In\n     1905 A.D., labor succeeded in getting a law passed in\n     Pennsylvania providing that proof of the age of the child\n     and of certain educational qualifications must accompany the\n     oath of the parent.  This was promptly declared\n     unconstitutional by the Luzerne County Court, on the ground\n     that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that it\n     discriminated between individuals of the same class--namely,\n     children above fourteen years of age and children below.\n     The state court sustained the decision.  The New York Court\n     of Special Sessions, in 1905 A.D., declared unconstitutional\n     the law prohibiting minors and women from working in\n     factories after nine o'clock at night, the ground taken\n     being that such a law was \"class legislation.\"  Again, the\n     bakers of that time were terribly overworked.  The New York\n     Legislature passed a law restricting work in bakeries to ten\n     hours a day.  In 1906 A.D., the Supreme Court of the United\n     States declared this law to be unconstitutional.  In part\n     the decision read: \"There is no reasonable ground for\n     interfering with the liberty of persons or the right of free\n     contract by determining the hours of labor in the occupation\n     of a baker.\"\n\n\"You run ahead too fast,\" O'Connor answered. \"You don't know all the\nways out. There is another way out. We know what we're about. We're sick\nof strikes. They've got us beaten that way to a frazzle. But I don't\nthink we'll ever need to call our men out again.\"\n\n\"What is your way out?\" Ernest demanded bluntly.\n\nO'Connor laughed and shook his head. \"I can tell you this much: We've\nnot been asleep. And we're not dreaming now.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of, or ashamed of, I hope,\" Ernest\nchallenged.\n\n\"I guess we know our business best,\" was the retort.\n\n\"It's a dark business, from the way you hide it,\" Ernest said with\ngrowing anger.\n\n\"We've paid for our experience in sweat and blood, and we've earned all\nthat's coming to us,\" was the reply. \"Charity begins at home.\"\n\n\"If you're afraid to tell me your way out, I'll tell it to you.\"\nErnest's blood was up. \"You're going in for grab-sharing. You've made\nterms with the enemy, that's what you've done. You've sold out the cause\nof labor, of all labor. You are leaving the battle-field like cowards.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying anything,\" O'Connor answered sullenly. \"Only I guess we\nknow what's best for us a little bit better than you do.\"\n\n\"And you don't care a cent for what is best for the rest of labor. You\nkick it into the ditch.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying anything,\" O'Connor replied, \"except that I'm president\nof the Machinists' Association, and it's my business to consider the\ninterests of the men I represent, that's all.\"\n\nAnd then, when the labor leaders had left, Ernest, with the calmness of\ndefeat, outlined to me the course of events to come.\n\n\"The socialists used to foretell with joy,\" he said, \"the coming of the\nday when organized labor, defeated on the industrial field, would come\nover on to the political field. Well, the Iron Heel has defeated\nthe labor unions on the industrial field and driven them over to the\npolitical field; and instead of this being joyful for us, it will be\na source of grief. The Iron Heel learned its lesson. We showed it our\npower in the general strike. It has taken steps to prevent another\ngeneral strike.\"\n\n\"But how?\" I asked.\n\n\"Simply by subsidizing the great unions. They won't join in the next\ngeneral strike. Therefore it won't be a general strike.\"\n\n\"But the Iron Heel can't maintain so costly a programme forever,\" I\nobjected.\n\n\"Oh, it hasn't subsidized all of the unions. That's not necessary. Here\nis what is going to happen. Wages are going to be advanced and hours\nshortened in the railroad unions, the iron and steel workers unions,\nand the engineer and machinist unions. In these unions more favorable\nconditions will continue to prevail. Membership in these unions will\nbecome like seats in Paradise.\"\n\n\"Still I don't see,\" I objected. \"What is to become of the other unions?\nThere are far more unions outside of this combination than in it.\"\n\n\"The other unions will be ground out of existence--all of them. For,\ndon't you see, the railway men, machinists and engineers, iron and\nsteel workers, do all of the vitally essential work in our machine\ncivilization. Assured of their faithfulness, the Iron Heel can snap\nits fingers at all the rest of labor. Iron, steel, coal, machinery, and\ntransportation constitute the backbone of the whole industrial fabric.\"\n\n\"But coal?\" I queried. \"There are nearly a million coal miners.\"\n\nThey are practically unskilled labor. They will not count. Their wages\nwill go down and their hours will increase. They will be slaves like all\nthe rest of us, and they will become about the most bestial of all of\nus. They will be compelled to work, just as the farmers are compelled\nto work now for the masters who robbed them of their land. And the same\nwith all the other unions outside the combination. Watch them wobble and\ngo to pieces, and their members become slaves driven to toil by empty\nstomachs and the law of the land.\n\n\"Do you know what will happen to Farley* and his strike-breakers? I'll\ntell you. Strike-breaking as an occupation will cease. There won't be\nany more strikes. In place of strikes will be slave revolts. Farley and\nhis gang will be promoted to slave-driving. Oh, it won't be called\nthat; it will be called enforcing the law of the land that compels the\nlaborers to work. It simply prolongs the fight, this treachery of the\nbig unions. Heaven only knows now where and when the Revolution will\ntriumph.\"\n\n     * James Farley--a notorious strike-breaker of the period.  A\n     man more courageous than ethical, and of undeniable ability.\n     He rose high under the rule of the Iron Heel and finally was\n     translated into the oligarch class.  He was assassinated in\n     1932 by Sarah Jenkins, whose husband, thirty years before,\n     had been killed by Farley's strike-breakers.\n\n\"But with such a powerful combination as the Oligarchy and the big\nunions, is there any reason to believe that the Revolution will ever\ntriumph?\" I queried. \"May not the combination endure forever?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"One of our generalizations is that every system\nfounded upon class and caste contains within itself the germs of its own\ndecay. When a system is founded upon class, how can caste be prevented?\nThe Iron Heel will not be able to prevent it, and in the end caste will\ndestroy the Iron Heel. The oligarchs have already developed caste among\nthemselves; but wait until the favored unions develop caste. The Iron\nHeel will use all its power to prevent it, but it will fail.\n\n\"In the favored unions are the flower of the American workingmen. They\nare strong, efficient men. They have become members of those unions\nthrough competition for place. Every fit workman in the United States\nwill be possessed by the ambition to become a member of the favored\nunions. The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent\ncompetition. Thus will the strong men, who might else be revolutionists,\nbe won away and their strength used to bolster the Oligarchy.\n\n\"On the other hand, the labor castes, the members of the favored unions,\nwill strive to make their organizations into close corporations.\nAnd they will succeed. Membership in the labor castes will become\nhereditary. Sons will succeed fathers, and there will be no inflow of\nnew strength from that eternal reservoir of strength, the common people.\nThis will mean deterioration of the labor castes, and in the end they\nwill become weaker and weaker. At the same time, as an institution, they\nwill become temporarily all-powerful. They will be like the guards of\nthe palace in old Rome, and there will be palace revolutions whereby\nthe labor castes will seize the reins of power. And there will be\ncounter-palace revolutions of the oligarchs, and sometimes the one, and\nsometimes the other, will be in power. And through it all the inevitable\ncaste-weakening will go on, so that in the end the common people will\ncome into their own.\"\n\nThis foreshadowing of a slow social evolution was made when Ernest was\nfirst depressed by the defection of the great unions. I never agreed\nwith him in it, and I disagree now, as I write these lines, more\nheartily than ever; for even now, though Ernest is gone, we are on the\nverge of the revolt that will sweep all oligarchies away. Yet I have\nhere given Ernest's prophecy because it was his prophecy. In spite of\nhis belief in it, he worked like a giant against it, and he, more than\nany man, has made possible the revolt that even now waits the signal to\nburst forth.*\n\n     * Everhard's social foresight was remarkable.  As clearly as\n     in the light of past events, he saw the defection of the\n     favored unions, the rise and the slow decay of the labor\n     castes, and the struggle between the decaying oligarchs and\n     labor castes for control of the great governmental machine.\n\n\"But if the Oligarchy persists,\" I asked him that evening, \"what will\nbecome of the great surpluses that will fall to its share every year?\"\n\n\"The surpluses will have to be expended somehow,\" he answered; \"and\ntrust the oligarchs to find a way. Magnificent roads will be built.\nThere will be great achievements in science, and especially in art. When\nthe oligarchs have completely mastered the people, they will have time\nto spare for other things. They will become worshippers of beauty.\nThey will become art-lovers. And under their direction and generously\nrewarded, will toil the artists. The result will be great art; for no\nlonger, as up to yesterday, will the artists pander to the bourgeois\ntaste of the middle class. It will be great art, I tell you, and wonder\ncities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old\ntime. And in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship beauty.*\n\n     * We cannot but marvel at Everhard's foresight.  Before ever\n     the thought of wonder cities like Ardis and Asgard entered\n     the minds of the oligarchs, Everhard saw those cities and\n     the inevitable necessity for their creation.\n\n\"Thus will the surplus be constantly expended while labor does the work.\nThe building of these great works and cities will give a starvation\nration to millions of common laborers, for the enormous bulk of the\nsurplus will compel an equally enormous expenditure, and the oligarchs\nwill build for a thousand years--ay, for ten thousand years. They will\nbuild as the Egyptians and the Babylonians never dreamed of building;\nand when the oligarchs have passed away, their great roads and their\nwonder cities will remain for the brotherhood of labor to tread upon and\ndwell within.*\n\n     * And since that day of prophecy, have passed away the three\n     centuries of the Iron Heel and the four centuries of the\n     Brotherhood of Man, and to-day we tread the roads and dwell\n     in the cities that the oligarchs built.  It is true, we are\n     even now building still more wonderful wonder cities, but\n     the wonder cities of the oligarchs endure, and I write these\n     lines in Ardis, one of the most wonderful of them all.\n\n\"These things the oligarchs will do because they cannot help doing them.\nThese great works will be the form their expenditure of the surplus will\ntake, and in the same way that the ruling classes of Egypt of long ago\nexpended the surplus they robbed from the people by the building of\ntemples and pyramids. Under the oligarchs will flourish, not a priest\nclass, but an artist class. And in place of the merchant class of\nbourgeoisie will be the labor castes. And beneath will be the abyss,\nwherein will fester and starve and rot, and ever renew itself, the\ncommon people, the great bulk of the population. And in the end, who\nknows in what day, the common people will rise up out of the abyss; the\nlabor castes and the Oligarchy will crumble away; and then, at last,\nafter the travail of the centuries, will it be the day of the common\nman. I had thought to see that day; but now I know that I shall never\nsee it.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at me, and added:\n\n\"Social evolution is exasperatingly slow, isn't it, sweetheart?\"\n\nMy arms were about him, and his head was on my breast.\n\n\"Sing me to sleep,\" he murmured whimsically. \"I have had a visioning,\nand I wish to forget.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nLAST DAYS\n\n\nIt was near the end of January, 1913, that the changed attitude of the\nOligarchy toward the favored unions was made public. The newspapers\npublished information of an unprecedented rise in wages and shortening\nof hours for the railroad employees, the iron and steel workers, and\nthe engineers and machinists. But the whole truth was not told. The\noligarchs did not dare permit the telling of the whole truth. In\nreality, the wages had been raised much higher, and the privileges were\ncorrespondingly greater. All this was secret, but secrets will out.\nMembers of the favored unions told their wives, and the wives gossiped,\nand soon all the labor world knew what had happened.\n\nIt was merely the logical development of what in the nineteenth century\nhad been known as grab-sharing. In the industrial warfare of that time,\nprofit-sharing had been tried. That is, the capitalists had striven to\nplacate the workers by interesting them financially in their work.\nBut profit-sharing, as a system, was ridiculous and impossible.\nProfit-sharing could be successful only in isolated cases in the midst\nof a system of industrial strife; for if all labor and all capital\nshared profits, the same conditions would obtain as did obtain when\nthere was no profit-sharing.\n\nSo, out of the unpractical idea of profit-sharing, arose the practical\nidea of grab-sharing. \"Give us more pay and charge it to the public,\"\nwas the slogan of the strong unions.* And here and there this selfish\npolicy worked successfully. In charging it to the public, it was charged\nto the great mass of unorganized labor and of weakly organized labor.\nThese workers actually paid the increased wages of their stronger\nbrothers who were members of unions that were labor monopolies. This\nidea, as I say, was merely carried to its logical conclusion, on a large\nscale, by the combination of the oligarchs and the favored unions.\n\n     * All the railroad unions entered into this combination with\n     the oligarchs, and it is of interest to note that the first\n     definite application of the policy of profit-grabbing was\n     made by a railroad union in the nineteenth century A.D.,\n     namely, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.  P. M.\n     Arthur was for twenty years Grand Chief of the Brotherhood.\n     After the strike on the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1877, he\n     broached a scheme to have the Locomotive Engineers make\n     terms with the railroads and to \"go it alone\" so far as the\n     rest of the labor unions were concerned.  This scheme was\n     eminently successful.  It was as successful as it was\n     selfish, and out of it was coined the word \"arthurization,\"\n     to denote grab-sharing on the part of labor unions.  This\n     word \"arthurization\" has long puzzled the etymologists, but\n     its derivation, I hope, is now made clear.\n\nAs soon as the secret of the defection of the favored unions leaked\nout, there were rumblings and mutterings in the labor world. Next, the\nfavored unions withdrew from the international organizations and broke\noff all affiliations. Then came trouble and violence. The members of the\nfavored unions were branded as traitors, and in saloons and brothels, on\nthe streets and at work, and, in fact, everywhere, they were assaulted\nby the comrades they had so treacherously deserted.\n\nCountless heads were broken, and there were many killed. No member of\nthe favored unions was safe. They gathered together in bands in order to\ngo to work or to return from work. They walked always in the middle\nof the street. On the sidewalk they were liable to have their skulls\ncrushed by bricks and cobblestones thrown from windows and house-tops.\nThey were permitted to carry weapons, and the authorities aided them\nin every way. Their persecutors were sentenced to long terms in prison,\nwhere they were harshly treated; while no man, not a member of the\nfavored unions, was permitted to carry weapons. Violation of this law\nwas made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly.\n\nOutraged labor continued to wreak vengeance on the traitors. Caste lines\nformed automatically. The children of the traitors were persecuted\nby the children of the workers who had been betrayed, until it was\nimpossible for the former to play on the streets or to attend the public\nschools. Also, the wives and families of the traitors were ostracized,\nwhile the corner groceryman who sold provisions to them was boycotted.\n\nAs a result, driven back upon themselves from every side, the traitors\nand their families became clannish. Finding it impossible to dwell in\nsafety in the midst of the betrayed proletariat, they moved into new\nlocalities inhabited by themselves alone. In this they were favored by\nthe oligarchs. Good dwellings, modern and sanitary, were built for them,\nsurrounded by spacious yards, and separated here and there by parks and\nplaygrounds. Their children attended schools especially built for\nthem, and in these schools manual training and applied science were\nspecialized upon. Thus, and unavoidably, at the very beginning, out of\nthis segregation arose caste. The members of the favored unions became\nthe aristocracy of labor. They were set apart from the rest of labor.\nThey were better housed, better clothed, better fed, better treated.\nThey were grab-sharing with a vengeance.\n\nIn the meantime, the rest of the working class was more harshly treated.\nMany little privileges were taken away from it, while its wages and its\nstandard of living steadily sank down. Incidentally, its public schools\ndeteriorated, and education slowly ceased to be compulsory. The increase\nin the younger generation of children who could not read nor write was\nperilous.\n\nThe capture of the world-market by the United States had disrupted the\nrest of the world. Institutions and governments were everywhere crashing\nor transforming. Germany, Italy, France, Australia, and New Zealand were\nbusy forming cooperative commonwealths. The British Empire was falling\napart. England's hands were full. In India revolt was in full swing. The\ncry in all Asia was, \"Asia for the Asiatics!\" And behind this cry was\nJapan, ever urging and aiding the yellow and brown races against the\nwhite. And while Japan dreamed of continental empire and strove to\nrealize the dream, she suppressed her own proletarian revolution. It\nwas a simple war of the castes, Coolie versus Samurai, and the coolie\nsocialists were executed by tens of thousands. Forty thousand were\nkilled in the street-fighting of Tokio and in the futile assault on\nthe Mikado's palace. Kobe was a shambles; the slaughter of the cotton\noperatives by machine-guns became classic as the most terrific execution\never achieved by modern war machines. Most savage of all was the\nJapanese Oligarchy that arose. Japan dominated the East, and took\nto herself the whole Asiatic portion of the world-market, with the\nexception of India.\n\nEngland managed to crush her own proletarian revolution and to hold on\nto India, though she was brought to the verge of exhaustion. Also, she\nwas compelled to let her great colonies slip away from her. So it was\nthat the socialists succeeded in making Australia and New Zealand into\ncooperative commonwealths. And it was for the same reason that Canada\nwas lost to the mother country. But Canada crushed her own socialist\nrevolution, being aided in this by the Iron Heel. At the same time, the\nIron Heel helped Mexico and Cuba to put down revolt. The result was that\nthe Iron Heel was firmly established in the New World. It had welded\ninto one compact political mass the whole of North America from the\nPanama Canal to the Arctic Ocean.\n\nAnd England, at the sacrifice of her great colonies, had succeeded only\nin retaining India. But this was no more than temporary. The struggle\nwith Japan and the rest of Asia for India was merely delayed. England\nwas destined shortly to lose India, while behind that event loomed the\nstruggle between a united Asia and the world.\n\nAnd while all the world was torn with conflict, we of the United States\nwere not placid and peaceful. The defection of the great unions had\nprevented our proletarian revolt, but violence was everywhere. In\naddition to the labor troubles, and the discontent of the farmers and of\nthe remnant of the middle class, a religious revival had blazed up. An\noffshoot of the Seventh Day Adventists sprang into sudden prominence,\nproclaiming the end of the world.\n\n\"Confusion thrice confounded!\" Ernest cried. \"How can we hope for\nsolidarity with all these cross purposes and conflicts?\"\n\nAnd truly the religious revival assumed formidable proportions. The\npeople, what of their wretchedness, and of their disappointment in\nall things earthly, were ripe and eager for a heaven where industrial\ntyrants entered no more than camels passed through needle-eyes.\nWild-eyed itinerant preachers swarmed over the land; and despite\nthe prohibition of the civil authorities, and the persecution for\ndisobedience, the flames of religious frenzy were fanned by countless\ncamp-meetings.\n\nIt was the last days, they claimed, the beginning of the end of the\nworld. The four winds had been loosed. God had stirred the nations\nto strife. It was a time of visions and miracles, while seers and\nprophetesses were legion. The people ceased work by hundreds of\nthousands and fled to the mountains, there to await the imminent coming\nof God and the rising of the hundred and forty and four thousand to\nheaven. But in the meantime God did not come, and they starved to death\nin great numbers. In their desperation they ravaged the farms for food,\nand the consequent tumult and anarchy in the country districts but\nincreased the woes of the poor expropriated farmers.\n\nAlso, the farms and warehouses were the property of the Iron Heel.\nArmies of troops were put into the field, and the fanatics were herded\nback at the bayonet point to their tasks in the cities. There they broke\nout in ever recurring mobs and riots. Their leaders were executed for\nsedition or confined in madhouses. Those who were executed went to their\ndeaths with all the gladness of martyrs. It was a time of madness. The\nunrest spread. In the swamps and deserts and waste places, from Florida\nto Alaska, the small groups of Indians that survived were dancing ghost\ndances and waiting the coming of a Messiah of their own.\n\nAnd through it all, with a serenity and certitude that was terrifying,\ncontinued to rise the form of that monster of the ages, the Oligarchy.\nWith iron hand and iron heel it mastered the surging millions, out\nof confusion brought order, out of the very chaos wrought its own\nfoundation and structure.\n\n\"Just wait till we get in,\" the Grangers said--Calvin said it to us in\nour Pell Street quarters. \"Look at the states we've captured. With you\nsocialists to back us, we'll make them sing another song when we take\noffice.\"\n\n\"The millions of the discontented and the impoverished are ours,\" the\nsocialists said. \"The Grangers have come over to us, the farmers, the\nmiddle class, and the laborers. The capitalist system will fall to\npieces. In another month we send fifty men to Congress. Two years\nhence every office will be ours, from the President down to the local\ndog-catcher.\"\n\nTo all of which Ernest would shake his head and say:\n\n\"How many rifles have you got? Do you know where you can get plenty\nof lead? When it comes to powder, chemical mixtures are better than\nmechanical mixtures, you take my word.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE END\n\n\nWhen it came time for Ernest and me to go to Washington, father did not\naccompany us. He had become enamoured of proletarian life. He looked\nupon our slum neighborhood as a great sociological laboratory, and\nhe had embarked upon an apparently endless orgy of investigation. He\nchummed with the laborers, and was an intimate in scores of homes.\nAlso, he worked at odd jobs, and the work was play as well as learned\ninvestigation, for he delighted in it and was always returning home with\ncopious notes and bubbling over with new adventures. He was the perfect\nscientist.\n\nThere was no need for his working at all, because Ernest managed to earn\nenough from his translating to take care of the three of us. But father\ninsisted on pursuing his favorite phantom, and a protean phantom it was,\njudging from the jobs he worked at. I shall never forget the evening he\nbrought home his street pedler's outfit of shoe-laces and suspenders,\nnor the time I went into the little corner grocery to make some purchase\nand had him wait on me. After that I was not surprised when he tended\nbar for a week in the saloon across the street. He worked as a night\nwatchman, hawked potatoes on the street, pasted labels in a cannery\nwarehouse, was utility man in a paper-box factory, and water-carrier\nfor a street railway construction gang, and even joined the Dishwashers'\nUnion just before it fell to pieces.\n\nI think the Bishop's example, so far as wearing apparel was concerned,\nmust have fascinated father, for he wore the cheap cotton shirt of the\nlaborer and the overalls with the narrow strap about the hips. Yet one\nhabit remained to him from the old life; he always dressed for dinner,\nor supper, rather.\n\nI could be happy anywhere with Ernest; and father's happiness in our\nchanged circumstances rounded out my own happiness.\n\n\"When I was a boy,\" father said, \"I was very curious. I wanted to know\nwhy things were and how they came to pass. That was why I became a\nphysicist. The life in me to-day is just as curious as it was in my\nboyhood, and it's the being curious that makes life worth living.\"\n\nSometimes he ventured north of Market Street into the shopping and\ntheatre district, where he sold papers, ran errands, and opened cabs.\nThere, one day, closing a cab, he encountered Mr. Wickson. In high glee\nfather described the incident to us that evening.\n\n\"Wickson looked at me sharply when I closed the door on him, and\nmuttered, 'Well, I'll be damned.' Just like that he said it, 'Well, I'll\nbe damned.' His face turned red and he was so confused that he forgot to\ntip me. But he must have recovered himself quickly, for the cab hadn't\ngone fifty feet before it turned around and came back. He leaned out of\nthe door.\n\n\"'Look here, Professor,' he said, 'this is too much. What can I do for\nyou?'\n\n\"'I closed the cab door for you,' I answered. 'According to common\ncustom you might give me a dime.'\n\n\"'Bother that!' he snorted. 'I mean something substantial.'\n\n\"He was certainly serious--a twinge of ossified conscience or something;\nand so I considered with grave deliberation for a moment.\n\n\"His face was quite expectant when I began my answer, but you should\nhave seen it when I finished.\n\n\"'You might give me back my home,' I said, 'and my stock in the Sierra\nMills.'\"\n\nFather paused.\n\n\"What did he say?\" I questioned eagerly.\n\n\"What could he say? He said nothing. But I said. 'I hope you are happy.'\nHe looked at me curiously. 'Tell me, are you happy?'\" I asked.\n\n\"He ordered the cabman to drive on, and went away swearing horribly. And\nhe didn't give me the dime, much less the home and stock; so you see, my\ndear, your father's street-arab career is beset with disappointments.\"\n\nAnd so it was that father kept on at our Pell Street quarters, while\nErnest and I went to Washington. Except for the final consummation, the\nold order had passed away, and the final consummation was nearer than\nI dreamed. Contrary to our expectation, no obstacles were raised to\nprevent the socialist Congressmen from taking their seats. Everything\nwent smoothly, and I laughed at Ernest when he looked upon the very\nsmoothness as something ominous.\n\nWe found our socialist comrades confident, optimistic of their strength\nand of the things they would accomplish. A few Grangers who had been\nelected to Congress increased our strength, and an elaborate programme\nof what was to be done was prepared by the united forces. In all of\nwhich Ernest joined loyally and energetically, though he could not\nforbear, now and again, from saying, apropos of nothing in particular,\n\"When it comes to powder, chemical mixtures are better than mechanical\nmixtures, you take my word.\"\n\nThe trouble arose first with the Grangers in the various states they had\ncaptured at the last election. There were a dozen of these states, but\nthe Grangers who had been elected were not permitted to take office. The\nincumbents refused to get out. It was very simple. They merely charged\nillegality in the elections and wrapped up the whole situation in the\ninterminable red tape of the law. The Grangers were powerless. The\ncourts were in the hands of their enemies.\n\nThis was the moment of danger. If the cheated Grangers became violent,\nall was lost. How we socialists worked to hold them back! There were\ndays and nights when Ernest never closed his eyes in sleep. The big\nleaders of the Grangers saw the peril and were with us to a man. But\nit was all of no avail. The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set\nits agents-provocateurs to work. Without discussion, it was the\nagents-provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt.\n\nIn a dozen states the revolt flared up. The expropriated farmers\ntook forcible possession of the state governments. Of course this was\nunconstitutional, and of course the United States put its soldiers into\nthe field. Everywhere the agents-provocateurs urged the people on. These\nemissaries of the Iron Heel disguised themselves as artisans, farmers,\nand farm laborers. In Sacramento, the capital of California, the\nGrangers had succeeded in maintaining order. Thousands of secret agents\nwere rushed to the devoted city. In mobs composed wholly of themselves,\nthey fired and looted buildings and factories. They worked the people\nup until they joined them in the pillage. Liquor in large quantities was\ndistributed among the slum classes further to inflame their minds. And\nthen, when all was ready, appeared upon the scene the soldiers of the\nUnited States, who were, in reality, the soldiers of the Iron Heel.\nEleven thousand men, women, and children were shot down on the streets\nof Sacramento or murdered in their houses. The national government took\npossession of the state government, and all was over for California.\n\nAnd as with California, so elsewhere. Every Granger state was ravaged\nwith violence and washed in blood. First, disorder was precipitated by\nthe secret agents and the Black Hundreds, then the troops were called\nout. Rioting and mob-rule reigned throughout the rural districts. Day\nand night the smoke of burning farms, warehouses, villages, and cities\nfilled the sky. Dynamite appeared. Railroad bridges and tunnels were\nblown up and trains were wrecked. The poor farmers were shot and hanged\nin great numbers. Reprisals were bitter, and many plutocrats and army\nofficers were murdered. Blood and vengeance were in men's hearts. The\nregular troops fought the farmers as savagely as had they been Indians.\nAnd the regular troops had cause. Twenty-eight hundred of them had been\nannihilated in a tremendous series of dynamite explosions in Oregon,\nand in a similar manner, a number of train loads, at different times and\nplaces, had been destroyed. So it was that the regular troops fought for\ntheir lives as well as did the farmers.\n\nAs for the militia, the militia law of 1903 was put into effect, and the\nworkers of one state were compelled, under pain of death, to shoot down\ntheir comrade-workers in other states. Of course, the militia law did\nnot work smoothly at first. Many militia officers were murdered, and\nmany militiamen were executed by drumhead court martial. Ernest's\nprophecy was strikingly fulfilled in the cases of Mr. Kowalt and Mr.\nAsmunsen. Both were eligible for the militia, and both were drafted to\nserve in the punitive expedition that was despatched from California\nagainst the farmers of Missouri. Mr. Kowalt and Mr. Asmunsen refused to\nserve. They were given short shrift. Drumhead court martial was their\nportion, and military execution their end. They were shot with their\nbacks to the firing squad.\n\nMany young men fled into the mountains to escape serving in the militia.\nThere they became outlaws, and it was not until more peaceful times that\nthey received their punishment. It was drastic. The government issued a\nproclamation for all law-abiding citizens to come in from the mountains\nfor a period of three months. When the proclaimed date arrived, half a\nmillion soldiers were sent into the mountainous districts everywhere.\nThere was no investigation, no trial. Wherever a man was encountered, he\nwas shot down on the spot. The troops operated on the basis that no\nman not an outlaw remained in the mountains. Some bands, in strong\npositions, fought gallantly, but in the end every deserter from the\nmilitia met death.\n\nA more immediate lesson, however, was impressed on the minds of the\npeople by the punishment meted out to the Kansas militia. The great\nKansas Mutiny occurred at the very beginning of military operations\nagainst the Grangers. Six thousand of the militia mutinied. They had\nbeen for several weeks very turbulent and sullen, and for that reason\nhad been kept in camp. Their open mutiny, however, was without doubt\nprecipitated by the agents-provocateurs.\n\nOn the night of the 22d of April they arose and murdered their officers,\nonly a small remnant of the latter escaping. This was beyond the scheme\nof the Iron Heel, for the agents-provocateurs had done their work too\nwell. But everything was grist to the Iron Heel. It had prepared for the\noutbreak, and the killing of so many officers gave it justification for\nwhat followed. As by magic, forty thousand soldiers of the regular army\nsurrounded the malcontents. It was a trap. The wretched militiamen found\nthat their machine-guns had been tampered with, and that the cartridges\nfrom the captured magazines did not fit their rifles. They hoisted the\nwhite flag of surrender, but it was ignored. There were no survivors.\nThe entire six thousand were annihilated. Common shell and shrapnel were\nthrown in upon them from a distance, and, when, in their desperation,\nthey charged the encircling lines, they were mowed down by the\nmachine-guns. I talked with an eye-witness, and he said that the nearest\nany militiaman approached the machine-guns was a hundred and fifty\nyards. The earth was carpeted with the slain, and a final charge of\ncavalry, with trampling of horses' hoofs, revolvers, and sabres, crushed\nthe wounded into the ground.\n\nSimultaneously with the destruction of the Grangers came the revolt\nof the coal miners. It was the expiring effort of organized labor.\nThree-quarters of a million of miners went out on strike. But they\nwere too widely scattered over the country to advantage from their own\nstrength. They were segregated in their own districts and beaten into\nsubmission. This was the first great slave-drive. Pocock* won his spurs\nas a slave-driver and earned the undying hatred of the proletariat.\nCountless attempts were made upon his life, but he seemed to bear a\ncharmed existence. It was he who was responsible for the introduction\nof the Russian passport system among the miners, and the denial of their\nright of removal from one part of the country to another.\n\n     * Albert Pocock, another of the notorious strike-breakers of\n     earlier years, who, to the day of his death, successfully\n     held all the coal-miners of the country to their task.  He\n     was succeeded by his son, Lewis Pocock, and for five\n     generations this remarkable line of slave-drivers handled\n     the coal mines.  The elder Pocock, known as Pocock I., has\n     been described as follows: \"A long, lean head, semicircled\n     by a fringe of brown and gray hair, with big cheek-bones and\n     a heavy chin, . . . a pale face, lustreless gray eyes, a\n     metallic voice, and a languid manner.\"  He was born of\n     humble parents, and began his career as a bartender.  He\n     next became a private detective for a street railway\n     corporation, and by successive steps developed into a\n     professional strikebreaker. Pocock V., the last of the line,\n     was blown up in a pump-house by a bomb during a petty revolt\n     of the miners in the Indian Territory. This occurred in 2073\n     A.D.\n\nIn the meantime, the socialists held firm. While the Grangers expired in\nflame and blood, and organized labor was disrupted, the socialists\nheld their peace and perfected their secret organization. In vain the\nGrangers pleaded with us. We rightly contended that any revolt on our\npart was virtually suicide for the whole Revolution. The Iron Heel, at\nfirst dubious about dealing with the entire proletariat at one time, had\nfound the work easier than it had expected, and would have asked nothing\nbetter than an uprising on our part. But we avoided the issue, in spite\nof the fact that agents-provocateurs swarmed in our midst. In those\nearly days, the agents of the Iron Heel were clumsy in their methods.\nThey had much to learn and in the meantime our Fighting Groups weeded\nthem out. It was bitter, bloody work, but we were fighting for life and\nfor the Revolution, and we had to fight the enemy with its own weapons.\nYet we were fair. No agent of the Iron Heel was executed without a\ntrial. We may have made mistakes, but if so, very rarely. The bravest,\nand the most combative and self-sacrificing of our comrades went into\nthe Fighting Groups. Once, after ten years had passed, Ernest made a\ncalculation from figures furnished by the chiefs of the Fighting Groups,\nand his conclusion was that the average life of a man or woman after\nbecoming a member was five years. The comrades of the Fighting Groups\nwere heroes all, and the peculiar thing about it was that they were\nopposed to the taking of life. They violated their own natures, yet they\nloved liberty and knew of no sacrifice too great to make for the Cause.*\n\n     * These Fighting groups were modelled somewhat after the\n     Fighting Organization of the Russian Revolution, and,\n     despite the unceasing efforts of the Iron Heel, these groups\n     persisted throughout the three centuries of its existence.\n     Composed of men and women actuated by lofty purpose and\n     unafraid to die, the Fighting Groups exercised tremendous\n     influence and tempered the savage brutality of the rulers.\n     Not alone was their work confined to unseen warfare with the\n     secret agents of the Oligarchy.  The oligarchs themselves\n     were compelled to listen to the decrees of the Groups, and\n     often, when they disobeyed, were punished by death--and\n     likewise with the subordinates of the oligarchs, with the\n     officers of the army and the leaders of the labor castes.\n\n     Stern justice was meted out by these organized avengers, but\n     most remarkable was their passionless and judicial\n     procedure.  There were no snap judgments.  When a man was\n     captured he was given fair trial and opportunity for\n     defence.  Of necessity, many men were tried and condemned by\n     proxy, as in the case of General Lampton. This occurred in\n     2138 A.D.  Possibly the most bloodthirsty and malignant of\n     all the mercenaries that ever served the Iron Heel, he was\n     informed by the Fighting Groups that they had tried him,\n     found him guilty, and condemned him to death--and this,\n     after three warnings for him to cease from his ferocious\n     treatment of the proletariat.  After his condemnation he\n     surrounded himself with a myriad protective devices.  Years\n     passed, and in vain the Fighting Groups strove to execute\n     their decree.  Comrade after comrade, men and women, failed\n     in their attempts, and were cruelly executed by the\n     Oligarchy.  It was the case of General Lampton that revived\n     crucifixion as a legal method of execution.  But in the end\n     the condemned man found his executioner in the form of a\n     slender girl of seventeen, Madeline Provence, who, to\n     accomplish her purpose, served two years in his palace as a\n     seamstress to the household. She died in solitary\n     confinement after horrible and prolonged torture; but to-day\n     she stands in imperishable bronze in the Pantheon of\n     Brotherhood in the wonder city of Serles.\n\n     We, who by personal experience know nothing of bloodshed,\n     must not judge harshly the heroes of the Fighting Groups.\n     They gave up their lives for humanity, no sacrifice was too\n     great for them to accomplish, while inexorable necessity\n     compelled them to bloody expression in an age of blood.  The\n     Fighting Groups constituted the one thorn in the side of the\n     Iron Heel that the Iron Heel could never remove.  Everhard\n     was the father of this curious army, and its accomplishments\n     and successful persistence for three hundred years bear\n     witness to the wisdom with which he organized and the solid\n     foundation he laid for the succeeding generations to build\n     upon.  In some respects, despite his great economic and\n     sociological contributions, and his work as a general leader\n     in the Revolution, his organization of the Fighting Groups\n     must be regarded as his greatest achievement.\n\nThe task we set ourselves was threefold. First, the weeding out from our\ncircles of the secret agents of the Oligarchy. Second, the organizing\nof the Fighting Groups, and outside of them, of the general secret\norganization of the Revolution. And third, the introduction of our own\nsecret agents into every branch of the Oligarchy--into the labor castes\nand especially among the telegraphers and secretaries and clerks, into\nthe army, the agents-provocateurs, and the slave-drivers. It was slow\nwork, and perilous, and often were our efforts rewarded with costly\nfailures.\n\nThe Iron Heel had triumphed in open warfare, but we held our own in the\nnew warfare, strange and awful and subterranean, that we instituted.\nAll was unseen, much was unguessed; the blind fought the blind; and\nyet through it all was order, purpose, control. We permeated the\nentire organization of the Iron Heel with our agents, while our own\norganization was permeated with the agents of the Iron Heel. It was\nwarfare dark and devious, replete with intrigue and conspiracy, plot\nand counterplot. And behind all, ever menacing, was death, violent and\nterrible. Men and women disappeared, our nearest and dearest comrades.\nWe saw them to-day. To-morrow they were gone; we never saw them again,\nand we knew that they had died.\n\nThere was no trust, no confidence anywhere. The man who plotted beside\nus, for all we knew, might be an agent of the Iron Heel. We mined the\norganization of the Iron Heel with our secret agents, and the Iron Heel\ncountermined with its secret agents inside its own organization. And\nit was the same with our organization. And despite the absence of\nconfidence and trust we were compelled to base our every effort on\nconfidence and trust. Often were we betrayed. Men were weak. The Iron\nHeel could offer money, leisure, the joys and pleasures that waited\nin the repose of the wonder cities. We could offer nothing but the\nsatisfaction of being faithful to a noble ideal. As for the rest, the\nwages of those who were loyal were unceasing peril, torture, and death.\n\nMen were weak, I say, and because of their weakness we were compelled to\nmake the only other reward that was within our power. It was the reward\nof death. Out of necessity we had to punish our traitors. For every man\nwho betrayed us, from one to a dozen faithful avengers were loosed upon\nhis heels. We might fail to carry out our decrees against our enemies,\nsuch as the Pococks, for instance; but the one thing we could not afford\nto fail in was the punishment of our own traitors. Comrades turned\ntraitor by permission, in order to win to the wonder cities and there\nexecute our sentences on the real traitors. In fact, so terrible did\nwe make ourselves, that it became a greater peril to betray us than to\nremain loyal to us.\n\nThe Revolution took on largely the character of religion. We worshipped\nat the shrine of the Revolution, which was the shrine of liberty. It was\nthe divine flashing through us. Men and women devoted their lives to\nthe Cause, and new-born babes were sealed to it as of old they had been\nsealed to the service of God. We were lovers of Humanity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE SCARLET LIVERY\n\n\nWith the destruction of the Granger states, the Grangers in Congress\ndisappeared. They were being tried for high treason, and their places\nwere taken by the creatures of the Iron Heel. The socialists were in a\npitiful minority, and they knew that their end was near. Congress and\nthe Senate were empty pretences, farces. Public questions were gravely\ndebated and passed upon according to the old forms, while in reality all\nthat was done was to give the stamp of constitutional procedure to the\nmandates of the Oligarchy.\n\nErnest was in the thick of the fight when the end came. It was in the\ndebate on the bill to assist the unemployed. The hard times of the\npreceding year had thrust great masses of the proletariat beneath the\nstarvation line, and the continued and wide-reaching disorder had but\nsunk them deeper. Millions of people were starving, while the oligarchs\nand their supporters were surfeiting on the surplus.* We called these\nwretched people the people of the abyss,** and it was to alleviate their\nawful suffering that the socialists had introduced the unemployed bill.\nBut this was not to the fancy of the Iron Heel. In its own way it was\npreparing to set these millions to work, but the way was not our way,\nwherefore it had issued its orders that our bill should be voted down.\nErnest and his fellows knew that their effort was futile, but they\nwere tired of the suspense. They wanted something to happen. They were\naccomplishing nothing, and the best they hoped for was the putting of an\nend to the legislative farce in which they were unwilling players.\nThey knew not what end would come, but they never anticipated a more\ndisastrous end than the one that did come.\n\n     * The same conditions obtained in the nineteenth century\n     A.D. under British rule in India.  The natives died of\n     starvation by the million, while their rulers robbed them of\n     the fruits of their toil and expended it on magnificent\n     pageants and mumbo-jumbo fooleries. Perforce, in this\n     enlightened age, we have much to blush for in the acts of\n     our ancestors.  Our only consolation is philosophic.  We\n     must accept the capitalistic stage in social evolution as\n     about on a par with the earlier monkey stage.  The human had\n     to pass through those stages in its rise from the mire and\n     slime of low organic life.  It was inevitable that much of\n     the mire and slime should cling and be not easily shaken\n     off.\n\n     ** The people of the abyss--this phrase was struck out by\n     the genius of H. G. Wells in the late nineteenth century\n     A.D.  Wells was a sociological seer, sane and normal as well\n     as warm human. Many fragments of his work have come down to\n     us, while two of his greatest achievements, \"Anticipations\"\n     and \"Mankind in the Making,\" have come down intact.  Before\n     the oligarchs, and before Everhard, Wells speculated upon\n     the building of the wonder cities, though in his writings\n     they are referred to as \"pleasure cities.\"\n\nI sat in the gallery that day. We all knew that something terrible was\nimminent. It was in the air, and its presence was made visible by the\narmed soldiers drawn up in lines in the corridors, and by the officers\ngrouped in the entrances to the House itself. The Oligarchy was about\nto strike. Ernest was speaking. He was describing the sufferings of\nthe unemployed, as if with the wild idea of in some way touching their\nhearts and consciences; but the Republican and Democratic members\nsneered and jeered at him, and there was uproar and confusion. Ernest\nabruptly changed front.\n\n\"I know nothing that I may say can influence you,\" he said. \"You have no\nsouls to be influenced. You are spineless, flaccid things. You pompously\ncall yourselves Republicans and Democrats. There is no Republican Party.\nThere is no Democratic Party. There are no Republicans nor Democrats in\nthis House. You are lick-spittlers and panderers, the creatures of the\nPlutocracy. You talk verbosely in antiquated terminology of your love\nof liberty, and all the while you wear the scarlet livery of the Iron\nHeel.\"\n\nHere the shouting and the cries of \"Order! order!\" drowned his voice,\nand he stood disdainfully till the din had somewhat subsided. He waved\nhis hand to include all of them, turned to his own comrades, and said:\n\n\"Listen to the bellowing of the well-fed beasts.\"\n\nPandemonium broke out again. The Speaker rapped for order and glanced\nexpectantly at the officers in the doorways. There were cries of\n\"Sedition!\" and a great, rotund New York member began shouting\n\"Anarchist!\" at Ernest. And Ernest was not pleasant to look at. Every\nfighting fibre of him was quivering, and his face was the face of a\nfighting animal, withal he was cool and collected.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said, in a voice that made itself heard above the din,\n\"that as you show mercy now to the proletariat, some day will that same\nproletariat show mercy to you.\"\n\nThe cries of \"Sedition!\" and \"Anarchist!\" redoubled.\n\n\"I know that you will not vote for this bill,\" Ernest went on. \"You have\nreceived the command from your masters to vote against it. And yet you\ncall me anarchist. You, who have destroyed the government of the people,\nand who shamelessly flaunt your scarlet shame in public places, call me\nanarchist. I do not believe in hell-fire and brimstone; but in moments\nlike this I regret my unbelief. Nay, in moments like this I almost do\nbelieve. Surely there must be a hell, for in no less place could it be\npossible for you to receive punishment adequate to your crimes. So long\nas you exist, there is a vital need for hell-fire in the Cosmos.\"\n\nThere was movement in the doorways. Ernest, the Speaker, all the members\nturned to see.\n\n\"Why do you not call your soldiers in, Mr. Speaker, and bid them do\ntheir work?\" Ernest demanded. \"They should carry out your plan with\nexpedition.\"\n\n\"There are other plans afoot,\" was the retort. \"That is why the soldiers\nare present.\"\n\n\"Our plans, I suppose,\" Ernest sneered. \"Assassination or something\nkindred.\"\n\nBut at the word \"assassination\" the uproar broke out again. Ernest could\nnot make himself heard, but he remained on his feet waiting for a lull.\nAnd then it happened. From my place in the gallery I saw nothing except\nthe flash of the explosion. The roar of it filled my ears and I saw\nErnest reeling and falling in a swirl of smoke, and the soldiers rushing\nup all the aisles. His comrades were on their feet, wild with anger,\ncapable of any violence. But Ernest steadied himself for a moment, and\nwaved his arms for silence.\n\n\"It is a plot!\" his voice rang out in warning to his comrades. \"Do\nnothing, or you will be destroyed.\"\n\nThen he slowly sank down, and the soldiers reached him. The next moment\nsoldiers were clearing the galleries and I saw no more.\n\nThough he was my husband, I was not permitted to get to him. When I\nannounced who I was, I was promptly placed under arrest. And at the same\ntime were arrested all socialist Congressmen in Washington, including\nthe unfortunate Simpson, who lay ill with typhoid fever in his hotel.\n\nThe trial was prompt and brief. The men were foredoomed. The wonder\nwas that Ernest was not executed. This was a blunder on the part of\nthe Oligarchy, and a costly one. But the Oligarchy was too confident in\nthose days. It was drunk with success, and little did it dream that\nthat small handful of heroes had within them the power to rock it to\nits foundations. To-morrow, when the Great Revolt breaks out and all\nthe world resounds with the tramp, tramp of the millions, the Oligarchy,\nwill realize, and too late, how mightily that band of heroes has grown.*\n\n     * Avis Everhard took for granted that her narrative would be\n     read in her own day, and so omits to mention the outcome of\n     the trial for high treason.  Many other similar\n     disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript.\n     Fifty-two socialist Congressmen were tried, and all were\n     found guilty.  Strange to relate, not one received the death\n     sentence.  Everhard and eleven others, among whom were\n     Theodore Donnelson and Matthew Kent, received life\n     imprisonment.  The remaining forty received sentences\n     varying from thirty to forty-five years; while Arthur\n     Simpson, referred to in the Manuscript as being ill of\n     typhoid fever at the time of the explosion, received only\n     fifteen years.  It is the tradition that he died of\n     starvation in solitary confinement, and this harsh treatment\n     is explained as having been caused by his uncompromising\n     stubbornness and his fiery and tactless hatred for all men\n     that served the despotism.  He died in Cabanas in Cuba,\n     where three of his comrades were also confined.  The fifty-\n     two socialist Congressmen were confined in military\n     fortresses scattered all over the United States.  Thus, Du\n     Bois and Woods were held in Porto Rico, while Everhard and\n     Merryweather were placed in Alcatraz, an island in San\n     Francisco Bay that had already seen long service as a\n     military prison.\n\nAs a revolutionist myself, as one on the inside who knew the hopes and\nfears and secret plans of the revolutionists, I am fitted to answer, as\nvery few are, the charge that they were guilty of exploding the bomb in\nCongress. And I can say flatly, without qualification or doubt of any\nsort, that the socialists, in Congress and out, had no hand in the\naffair. Who threw the bomb we do not know, but the one thing we are\nabsolutely sure of is that we did not throw it.\n\nOn the other hand, there is evidence to show that the Iron Heel was\nresponsible for the act. Of course, we cannot prove this. Our conclusion\nis merely presumptive. But here are such facts as we do know. It had\nbeen reported to the Speaker of the House, by secret-service agents of\nthe government, that the Socialist Congressmen were about to resort to\nterroristic tactics, and that they had decided upon the day when\ntheir tactics would go into effect. This day was the very day of\nthe explosion. Wherefore the Capitol had been packed with troops in\nanticipation. Since we knew nothing about the bomb, and since a bomb\nactually was exploded, and since the authorities had prepared in advance\nfor the explosion, it is only fair to conclude that the Iron Heel\ndid know. Furthermore, we charge that the Iron Heel was guilty of the\noutrage, and that the Iron Heel planned and perpetrated the outrage for\nthe purpose of foisting the guilt on our shoulders and so bringing about\nour destruction.\n\nFrom the Speaker the warning leaked out to all the creatures in\nthe House that wore the scarlet livery. They knew, while Ernest was\nspeaking, that some violent act was to be committed. And to do them\njustice, they honestly believed that the act was to be committed by\nthe socialists. At the trial, and still with honest belief, several\ntestified to having seen Ernest prepare to throw the bomb, and that it\nexploded prematurely. Of course they saw nothing of the sort. In the\nfevered imagination of fear they thought they saw, that was all.\n\nAs Ernest said at the trial: \"Does it stand to reason, if I were going\nto throw a bomb, that I should elect to throw a feeble little squib like\nthe one that was thrown? There wasn't enough powder in it. It made a lot\nof smoke, but hurt no one except me. It exploded right at my feet, and\nyet it did not kill me. Believe me, when I get to throwing bombs, I'll\ndo damage. There'll be more than smoke in my petards.\"\n\nIn return it was argued by the prosecution that the weakness of the\nbomb was a blunder on the part of the socialists, just as its premature\nexplosion, caused by Ernest's losing his nerve and dropping it, was a\nblunder. And to clinch the argument, there were the several Congressmen\nwho testified to having seen Ernest fumble and drop the bomb.\n\nAs for ourselves, not one of us knew how the bomb was thrown. Ernest\ntold me that the fraction of an instant before it exploded he both heard\nand saw it strike at his feet. He testified to this at the trial, but\nno one believed him. Besides, the whole thing, in popular slang, was\n\"cooked up.\" The Iron Heel had made up its mind to destroy us, and there\nwas no withstanding it.\n\nThere is a saying that truth will out. I have come to doubt that saying.\nNineteen years have elapsed, and despite our untiring efforts, we have\nfailed to find the man who really did throw the bomb. Undoubtedly he was\nsome emissary of the Iron Heel, but he has escaped detection. We have\nnever got the slightest clew to his identity. And now, at this late\ndate, nothing remains but for the affair to take its place among the\nmysteries of history.*\n\n     * Avis Everhard would have had to live for many generations\n     ere she could have seen the clearing up of this particular\n     mystery.  A little less than a hundred years ago, and a\n     little more than six hundred years after the death, the\n     confession of Pervaise was discovered in the secret archives\n     of the Vatican.  It is perhaps well to tell a little\n     something about this obscure document, which, in the main,\n     is of interest to the historian only.\n\n     Pervaise was an American, of French descent, who in 1913\n     A.D., was lying in the Tombs Prison, New York City, awaiting\n     trial for murder.  From his confession we learn that he was\n     not a criminal. He was warm-blooded, passionate, emotional.\n     In an insane fit of jealousy he killed his wife--a very\n     common act in those times. Pervaise was mastered by the fear\n     of death, all of which is recounted at length in his\n     confession.  To escape death he would have done anything,\n     and the police agents prepared him by assuring him that he\n     could not possibly escape conviction of murder in the first\n     degree when his trial came off.  In those days, murder in\n     the first degree was a capital offense.  The guilty man or\n     woman was placed in a specially constructed death-chair,\n     and, under the supervision of competent physicians, was\n     destroyed by a current of electricity.  This was called\n     electrocution, and it was very popular during that period.\n     Anaesthesia, as a mode of compulsory death, was not\n     introduced until later.\n\n     This man, good at heart but with a ferocious animalism close\n     at the surface of his being, lying in jail and expectant of\n     nothing less than death, was prevailed upon by the agents of\n     the Iron Heel to throw the bomb in the House of\n     Representatives.  In his confession he states explicitly\n     that he was informed that the bomb was to be a feeble thing\n     and that no lives would be lost.  This is directly in line\n     with the fact that the bomb was lightly charged, and that\n     its explosion at Everhard's feet was not deadly.\n\n     Pervaise was smuggled into one of the galleries ostensibly\n     closed for repairs.  He was to select the moment for the\n     throwing of the bomb, and he naively confesses that in his\n     interest in Everhard's tirade and the general commotion\n     raised thereby, he nearly forgot his mission.\n\n     Not only was he released from prison in reward for his deed,\n     but he was granted an income for life.  This he did not long\n     enjoy.  In 1914 A.D., in September, he was stricken with\n     rheumatism of the heart and lived for three days.  It was\n     then that he sent for the Catholic priest, Father Peter\n     Durban, and to him made confession. So important did it seem\n     to the priest, that he had the confession taken down in\n     writing and sworn to.  What happened after this we can only\n     surmise.  The document was certainly important enough to\n     find its way to Rome.  Powerful influences must have been\n     brought to bear, hence its suppression.  For centuries no\n     hint of its existence reached the world.  It was not until\n     in the last century that Lorbia, the brilliant Italian\n     scholar, stumbled upon it quite by chance during his\n     researches in the Vatican.\n\n     There is to-day no doubt whatever that the Iron Heel was\n     responsible for the bomb that exploded in the House of\n     Representatives in 1913 A.D.  Even though the Pervaise\n     confession had never come to light, no reasonable doubt\n     could obtain; for the act in question, that sent fifty-two\n     Congressmen to prison, was on a par with countless other\n     acts committed by the oligarchs, and, before them, by the\n     capitalists.\n\n     There is the classic instance of the ferocious and wanton\n     judicial murder of the innocent and so-called Haymarket\n     Anarchists in Chicago in the penultimate decade of the\n     nineteenth century A.D. In a category by itself is the\n     deliberate burning and destruction of capitalist property by\n     the capitalists themselves.  For such destruction of\n     property innocent men were frequently punished--\"railroaded\"\n     in the parlance of the times.\n\n     In the labor troubles of the first decade of the twentieth\n     century A.D., between the capitalists and the Western\n     Federation of Miners, similar but more bloody tactics were\n     employed.  The railroad station at Independence was blown up\n     by the agents of the capitalists.  Thirteen men were killed,\n     and many more were wounded. And then the capitalists,\n     controlling the legislative and judicial machinery of the\n     state of Colorado, charged the miners with the crime and\n     came very near to convicting them.  Romaines, one of the\n     tools in this affair, like Pervaise, was lying in jail in\n     another state, Kansas, awaiting trial, when he was\n     approached by the agents of the capitalists.  But, unlike\n     Pervaise the confession of Romaines was made public in his\n     own time.\n\n     Then, during this same period, there was the case of Moyer\n     and Haywood, two strong, fearless leaders of labor.  One was\n     president and the other was secretary of the Western\n     Federation of Miners. The ex-governor of Idaho had been\n     mysteriously murdered.  The crime, at the time, was openly\n     charged to the mine owners by the socialists and miners.\n     Nevertheless, in violation of the national and state\n     constitutions, and by means of conspiracy on the parts of\n     the governors of Idaho and Colorado, Moyer and Haywood were\n     kidnapped, thrown into jail, and charged with the murder.\n     It was this instance that provoked from Eugene V. Debs,\n     national leader of the American socialists at the time, the\n     following words: \"The labor leaders that cannot be bribed\n     nor bullied, must be ambushed and murdered.  The only crime\n     of Moyer and Haywood is that they have been unswervingly\n     true to the working class.  The capitalists have stolen our\n     country, debauched our politics, defiled our judiciary, and\n     ridden over us rough-shod, and now they propose to murder\n     those who will not abjectly surrender to their brutal\n     dominion.  The governors of Colorado and Idaho are but\n     executing the mandates of their masters, the Plutocracy.\n     The issue is the Workers versus the Plutocracy.  If they\n     strike the first violent blow, we will strike the last.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nIN THE SHADOW OF SONOMA\n\n\nOf myself, during this period, there is not much to say. For six months\nI was kept in prison, though charged with no crime. I was a suspect--a\nword of fear that all revolutionists were soon to come to know. But\nour own nascent secret service was beginning to work. By the end of\nmy second month in prison, one of the jailers made himself known as\na revolutionist in touch with the organization. Several weeks later,\nJoseph Parkhurst, the prison doctor who had just been appointed, proved\nhimself to be a member of one of the Fighting Groups.\n\nThus, throughout the organization of the Oligarchy, our own\norganization, weblike and spidery, was insinuating itself. And so I\nwas kept in touch with all that was happening in the world without. And\nfurthermore, every one of our imprisoned leaders was in contact with\nbrave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the Iron Heel. Though\nErnest lay in prison three thousand miles away, on the Pacific Coast, I\nwas in unbroken communication with him, and our letters passed regularly\nback and forth.\n\nThe leaders, in prison and out, were able to discuss and direct the\ncampaign. It would have been possible, within a few months, to have\neffected the escape of some of them; but since imprisonment proved\nno bar to our activities, it was decided to avoid anything premature.\nFifty-two Congressmen were in prison, and fully three hundred more\nof our leaders. It was planned that they should be delivered\nsimultaneously. If part of them escaped, the vigilance of the oligarchs\nmight be aroused so as to prevent the escape of the remainder. On the\nother hand, it was held that a simultaneous jail-delivery all over the\nland would have immense psychological influence on the proletariat. It\nwould show our strength and give confidence.\n\nSo it was arranged, when I was released at the end of six months, that\nI was to disappear and prepare a secure hiding-place for Ernest. To\ndisappear was in itself no easy thing. No sooner did I get my freedom\nthan my footsteps began to be dogged by the spies of the Iron Heel.\nIt was necessary that they should be thrown off the track, and that\nI should win to California. It is laughable, the way this was\naccomplished.\n\nAlready the passport system, modelled on the Russian, was developing. I\ndared not cross the continent in my own character. It was necessary that\nI should be completely lost if ever I was to see Ernest again, for by\ntrailing me after he escaped, he would be caught once more. Again, I\ncould not disguise myself as a proletarian and travel. There remained\nthe disguise of a member of the Oligarchy. While the arch-oligarchs were\nno more than a handful, there were myriads of lesser ones of the type,\nsay, of Mr. Wickson--men, worth a few millions, who were adherents of\nthe arch-oligarchs. The wives and daughters of these lesser oligarchs\nwere legion, and it was decided that I should assume the disguise of\nsuch a one. A few years later this would have been impossible, because\nthe passport system was to become so perfect that no man, woman, nor\nchild in all the land was unregistered and unaccounted for in his or her\nmovements.\n\nWhen the time was ripe, the spies were thrown off my track. An hour\nlater Avis Everhard was no more. At that time one Felice Van Verdighan,\naccompanied by two maids and a lap-dog, with another maid for the\nlap-dog,* entered a drawing-room on a Pullman,** and a few minutes later\nwas speeding west.\n\n     * This ridiculous picture well illustrates the heartless\n     conduct of the masters.  While people starved, lap-dogs were\n     waited upon by maids.  This was a serious masquerade on the\n     part of Avis Everhard. Life and death and the Cause were in\n     the issue; therefore the picture must be accepted as a true\n     picture.  It affords a striking commentary of the times.\n\n     ** Pullman--the designation of the more luxurious railway\n     cars of the period and so named from the inventor.\n\nThe three maids who accompanied me were revolutionists. Two were members\nof the Fighting Groups, and the third, Grace Holbrook, entered a group\nthe following year, and six months later was executed by the Iron Heel.\nShe it was who waited upon the dog. Of the other two, Bertha Stole\ndisappeared twelve years later, while Anna Roylston still lives and\nplays an increasingly important part in the Revolution.*\n\n     * Despite continual and almost inconceivable hazards, Anna\n     Roylston lived to the royal age of ninety-one.  As the\n     Pococks defied the executioners of the Fighting Groups, so\n     she defied the executioners of the Iron Heel.  She bore a\n     charmed life and prospered amid dangers and alarms.  She\n     herself was an executioner for the Fighting Groups, and,\n     known as the Red Virgin, she became one of the inspired\n     figures of the Revolution.  When she was an old woman of\n     sixty-nine she shot \"Bloody\" Halcliffe down in the midst of\n     his armed escort and got away unscathed.  In the end she\n     died peaceably of old age in a secret refuge of the\n     revolutionists in the Ozark mountains.\n\nWithout adventure we crossed the United States to California. When the\ntrain stopped at Sixteenth Street Station, in Oakland, we alighted, and\nthere Felice Van Verdighan, with her two maids, her lap-dog, and\nher lap-dog's maid, disappeared forever. The maids, guided by trusty\ncomrades, were led away. Other comrades took charge of me. Within half\nan hour after leaving the train I was on board a small fishing boat\nand out on the waters of San Francisco Bay. The winds baffled, and we\ndrifted aimlessly the greater part of the night. But I saw the lights of\nAlcatraz where Ernest lay, and found comfort in the thought of nearness\nto him. By dawn, what with the rowing of the fishermen, we made the\nMarin Islands. Here we lay in hiding all day, and on the following\nnight, swept on by a flood tide and a fresh wind, we crossed San Pablo\nBay in two hours and ran up Petaluma Creek.\n\nHere horses were ready and another comrade, and without delay we were\naway through the starlight. To the north I could see the loom of Sonoma\nMountain, toward which we rode. We left the old town of Sonoma to the\nright and rode up a canyon that lay between outlying buttresses of the\nmountain. The wagon-road became a wood-road, the wood-road became a\ncow-path, and the cow-path dwindled away and ceased among the upland\npastures. Straight over Sonoma Mountain we rode. It was the safest\nroute. There was no one to mark our passing.\n\nDawn caught us on the northern brow, and in the gray light we dropped\ndown through chaparral into redwood canyons deep and warm with the\nbreath of passing summer. It was old country to me that I knew and\nloved, and soon I became the guide. The hiding-place was mine. I had\nselected it. We let down the bars and crossed an upland meadow. Next, we\nwent over a low, oak-covered ridge and descended into a smaller meadow.\nAgain we climbed a ridge, this time riding under red-limbed madronos and\nmanzanitas of deeper red. The first rays of the sun streamed upon\nour backs as we climbed. A flight of quail thrummed off through the\nthickets. A big jackrabbit crossed our path, leaping swiftly and\nsilently like a deer. And then a deer, a many-pronged buck, the sun\nflashing red-gold from neck and shoulders, cleared the crest of the\nridge before us and was gone.\n\nWe followed in his wake a space, then dropped down a zigzag trail that\nhe disdained into a group of noble redwoods that stood about a pool of\nwater murky with minerals from the mountain side. I knew every inch of\nthe way. Once a writer friend of mine had owned the ranch; but he, too,\nhad become a revolutionist, though more disastrously than I, for he was\nalready dead and gone, and none knew where nor how. He alone, in the\ndays he had lived, knew the secret of the hiding-place for which I was\nbound. He had bought the ranch for beauty, and paid a round price for\nit, much to the disgust of the local farmers. He used to tell with great\nglee how they were wont to shake their heads mournfully at the price, to\naccomplish ponderously a bit of mental arithmetic, and then to say, \"But\nyou can't make six per cent on it.\"\n\nBut he was dead now, nor did the ranch descend to his children. Of all\nmen, it was now the property of Mr. Wickson, who owned the whole eastern\nand northern slopes of Sonoma Mountain, running from the Spreckels\nestate to the divide of Bennett Valley. Out of it he had made a\nmagnificent deer-park, where, over thousands of acres of sweet slopes\nand glades and canyons, the deer ran almost in primitive wildness. The\npeople who had owned the soil had been driven away. A state home for the\nfeeble-minded had also been demolished to make room for the deer.\n\nTo cap it all, Wickson's hunting lodge was a quarter of a mile from my\nhiding-place. This, instead of being a danger, was an added security.\nWe were sheltered under the very aegis of one of the minor oligarchs.\nSuspicion, by the nature of the situation, was turned aside. The last\nplace in the world the spies of the Iron Heel would dream of looking for\nme, and for Ernest when he joined me, was Wickson's deer-park.\n\nWe tied our horses among the redwoods at the pool. From a cache behind\na hollow rotting log my companion brought out a variety of things,--a\nfifty-pound sack of flour, tinned foods of all sorts, cooking utensils,\nblankets, a canvas tarpaulin, books and writing material, a great bundle\nof letters, a five-gallon can of kerosene, an oil stove, and, last and\nmost important, a large coil of stout rope. So large was the supply of\nthings that a number of trips would be necessary to carry them to the\nrefuge.\n\nBut the refuge was very near. Taking the rope and leading the way, I\npassed through a glade of tangled vines and bushes that ran between two\nwooded knolls. The glade ended abruptly at the steep bank of a stream.\nIt was a little stream, rising from springs, and the hottest summer\nnever dried it up. On every hand were tall wooded knolls, a group of\nthem, with all the seeming of having been flung there from some careless\nTitan's hand. There was no bed-rock in them. They rose from their bases\nhundreds of feet, and they were composed of red volcanic earth, the\nfamous wine-soil of Sonoma. Through these the tiny stream had cut its\ndeep and precipitous channel.\n\nIt was quite a scramble down to the stream bed, and, once on the bed,\nwe went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet. And then we came to the\ngreat hole. There was no warning of the existence of the hole, nor\nwas it a hole in the common sense of the word. One crawled through\ntight-locked briers and branches, and found oneself on the very edge,\npeering out and down through a green screen. A couple of hundred feet in\nlength and width, it was half of that in depth. Possibly because of\nsome fault that had occurred when the knolls were flung together, and\ncertainly helped by freakish erosion, the hole had been scooped out in\nthe course of centuries by the wash of water. Nowhere did the raw earth\nappear. All was garmented by vegetation, from tiny maiden-hair and\ngold-back ferns to mighty redwood and Douglas spruces. These great trees\neven sprang out from the walls of the hole. Some leaned over at angles\nas great as forty-five degrees, though the majority towered straight up\nfrom the soft and almost perpendicular earth walls.\n\nIt was a perfect hiding-place. No one ever came there, not even the\nvillage boys of Glen Ellen. Had this hole existed in the bed of a canyon\na mile long, or several miles long, it would have been well known. But\nthis was no canyon. From beginning to end the length of the stream was\nno more than five hundred yards. Three hundred yards above the hole the\nstream took its rise in a spring at the foot of a flat meadow. A hundred\nyards below the hole the stream ran out into open country, joining the\nmain stream and flowing across rolling and grass-covered land.\n\nMy companion took a turn of the rope around a tree, and with me fast on\nthe other end lowered away. In no time I was on the bottom. And in but\na short while he had carried all the articles from the cache and lowered\nthem down to me. He hauled the rope up and hid it, and before he went\naway called down to me a cheerful parting.\n\nBefore I go on I want to say a word for this comrade, John Carlson, a\nhumble figure of the Revolution, one of the countless faithful ones in\nthe ranks. He worked for Wickson, in the stables near the hunting lodge.\nIn fact, it was on Wickson's horses that we had ridden over Sonoma\nMountain. For nearly twenty years now John Carlson has been custodian\nof the refuge. No thought of disloyalty, I am sure, has ever entered his\nmind during all that time. To betray his trust would have been in his\nmind a thing undreamed. He was phlegmatic, stolid to such a degree that\none could not but wonder how the Revolution had any meaning to him at\nall. And yet love of freedom glowed sombrely and steadily in his\ndim soul. In ways it was indeed good that he was not flighty and\nimaginative. He never lost his head. He could obey orders, and he was\nneither curious nor garrulous. Once I asked how it was that he was a\nrevolutionist.\n\n\"When I was a young man I was a soldier,\" was his answer. \"It was in\nGermany. There all young men must be in the army. So I was in the army.\nThere was another soldier there, a young man, too. His father was what\nyou call an agitator, and his father was in jail for lese majesty--what\nyou call speaking the truth about the Emperor. And the young man, the\nson, talked with me much about people, and work, and the robbery of\nthe people by the capitalists. He made me see things in new ways, and\nI became a socialist. His talk was very true and good, and I have never\nforgotten. When I came to the United States I hunted up the socialists.\nI became a member of a section--that was in the day of the S. L. P.\nThen later, when the split came, I joined the local of the S. P. I was\nworking in a livery stable in San Francisco then. That was before the\nEarthquake. I have paid my dues for twenty-two years. I am yet a member,\nand I yet pay my dues, though it is very secret now. I will always pay\nmy dues, and when the cooperative commonwealth comes, I will be glad.\"\n\nLeft to myself, I proceeded to cook breakfast on the oil stove and to\nprepare my home. Often, in the early morning, or in the evening after\ndark, Carlson would steal down to the refuge and work for a couple of\nhours. At first my home was the tarpaulin. Later, a small tent was put\nup. And still later, when we became assured of the perfect security of\nthe place, a small house was erected. This house was completely hidden\nfrom any chance eye that might peer down from the edge of the hole. The\nlush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield. Also, the\nhouse was built against the perpendicular wall; and in the wall itself,\nshored by strong timbers, well drained and ventilated, we excavated two\nsmall rooms. Oh, believe me, we had many comforts. When Biedenbach,\nthe German terrorist, hid with us some time later, he installed a\nsmoke-consuming device that enabled us to sit by crackling wood fires on\nwinter nights.\n\nAnd here I must say a word for that gentle-souled terrorist, than whom\nthere is no comrade in the Revolution more fearfully misunderstood.\nComrade Biedenbach did not betray the Cause. Nor was he executed by\nthe comrades as is commonly supposed. This canard was circulated by\nthe creatures of the Oligarchy. Comrade Biedenbach was absent-minded,\nforgetful. He was shot by one of our lookouts at the cave-refuge at\nCarmel, through failure on his part to remember the secret signals. It\nwas all a sad mistake. And that he betrayed his Fighting Group is an\nabsolute lie. No truer, more loyal man ever labored for the Cause.*\n\n     * Search as we may through all the material of those times\n     that has come down to us, we can find no clew to the\n     Biedenbach here referred to.  No mention is made of him\n     anywhere save in the Everhard Manuscript.\n\n\nFor nineteen years now the refuge that I selected had been almost\ncontinuously occupied, and in all that time, with one exception, it has\nnever been discovered by an outsider.  And yet it was only a quarter of\na mile from Wickson's hunting-lodge, and a short mile from the village\nof Glen Ellen.  I was able, always, to hear the morning and evening\ntrains arrive and depart, and I used to set my watch by the whistle at\nthe brickyards.*\n\n     * If the curious traveller will turn south from Glen Ellen,\n     he will find himself on a boulevard that is identical with\n     the old country road seven centuries ago.  A quarter of a\n     mile from Glen Ellen, after the second bridge is passed, to\n     the right will be noticed a barranca that runs like a scar\n     across the rolling land toward a group of wooded knolls.\n     The barranca is the site of the ancient right of way that in\n     the time of private property in land ran across the holding\n     of one Chauvet, a French pioneer of California who came from\n     his native country in the fabled days of gold.  The wooded\n     knolls are the same knolls referred to by Avis Everhard.\n\n     The Great Earthquake of 2368 A.D. broke off the side of one\n     of these knolls and toppled it into the hole where the\n     Everhards made their refuge.  Since the finding of the\n     Manuscript excavations have been made, and the house, the\n     two cave rooms, and all the accumulated rubbish of long\n     occupancy have been brought to light. Many valuable relics\n     have been found, among which, curious to relate, is the\n     smoke-consuming device of Biedenbach's mentioned in the\n     narrative.  Students interested in such matters should read\n     the brochure of Arnold Bentham soon to be published.\n\n     A mile northwest from the wooded knolls brings one to the\n     site of Wake Robin Lodge at the junction of Wild-Water and\n     Sonoma Creeks. It may be noticed, in passing, that Wild-\n     Water was originally called Graham Creek and was so named on\n     the early local maps.  But the later name sticks.  It was at\n     Wake Robin Lodge that Avis Everhard later lived for short\n     periods, when, disguised as an agent-provocateur of the Iron\n     Heel, she was enabled to play with impunity her part among\n     men and events.  The official permission to occupy Wake\n     Robin Lodge is still on the records, signed by no less a man\n     than Wickson, the minor oligarch of the Manuscript.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTRANSFORMATION\n\n\n\"You must make yourself over again,\" Ernest wrote to me. \"You must cease\nto be. You must become another woman--and not merely in the clothes you\nwear, but inside your skin under the clothes. You must make yourself\nover again so that even I would not know you--your voice, your gestures,\nyour mannerisms, your carriage, your walk, everything.\"\n\nThis command I obeyed. Every day I practised for hours in burying\nforever the old Avis Everhard beneath the skin of another woman whom I\nmay call my other self. It was only by long practice that such results\ncould be obtained. In the mere detail of voice intonation I practised\nalmost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed,\nautomatic. It was this automatic assumption of a role that was\nconsidered imperative. One must become so adept as to deceive oneself.\nIt was like learning a new language, say the French. At first speech in\nFrench is self-conscious, a matter of the will. The student thinks\nin English and then transmutes into French, or reads in French but\ntransmutes into English before he can understand. Then later, becoming\nfirmly grounded, automatic, the student reads, writes, and THINKS in\nFrench, without any recourse to English at all.\n\nAnd so with our disguises. It was necessary for us to practise until our\nassumed roles became real; until to be our original selves would require\na watchful and strong exercise of will. Of course, at first, much was\nmere blundering experiment. We were creating a new art, and we had much\nto discover. But the work was going on everywhere; masters in the\nart were developing, and a fund of tricks and expedients was being\naccumulated. This fund became a sort of text-book that was passed on, a\npart of the curriculum, as it were, of the school of Revolution.*\n\n     * Disguise did become a veritable art during that period.\n     The revolutionists maintained schools of acting in all their\n     refuges. They scorned accessories, such as wigs and beards,\n     false eyebrows, and such aids of the theatrical actors.  The\n     game of revolution was a game of life and death, and mere\n     accessories were traps. Disguise had to be fundamental,\n     intrinsic, part and parcel of one's being, second nature.\n     The Red Virgin is reported to have been one of the most\n     adept in the art, to which must be ascribed her long and\n     successful career.\n\nIt was at this time that my father disappeared. His letters, which had\ncome to me regularly, ceased. He no longer appeared at our Pell Street\nquarters. Our comrades sought him everywhere. Through our secret service\nwe ransacked every prison in the land. But he was lost as completely as\nif the earth had swallowed him up, and to this day no clew to his end\nhas been discovered.*\n\n     * Disappearance was one of the horrors of the time.  As a\n     motif, in song and story, it constantly crops up.  It was an\n     inevitable concomitant of the subterranean warfare that\n     raged through those three centuries.  This phenomenon was\n     almost as common in the oligarch class and the labor castes,\n     as it was in the ranks of the revolutionists.  Without\n     warning, without trace, men and women, and even children,\n     disappeared and were seen no more, their end shrouded in\n     mystery.\n\nSix lonely months I spent in the refuge, but they were not idle months.\nOur organization went on apace, and there were mountains of work always\nwaiting to be done. Ernest and his fellow-leaders, from their prisons,\ndecided what should be done; and it remained for us on the outside to\ndo it. There was the organization of the mouth-to-mouth propaganda;\nthe organization, with all its ramifications, of our spy system; the\nestablishment of our secret printing-presses; and the establishment of\nour underground railways, which meant the knitting together of all our\nmyriads of places of refuge, and the formation of new refuges where\nlinks were missing in the chains we ran over all the land.\n\nSo I say, the work was never done. At the end of six months my\nloneliness was broken by the arrival of two comrades. They were young\ngirls, brave souls and passionate lovers of liberty: Lora Peterson, who\ndisappeared in 1922, and Kate Bierce, who later married Du Bois,* and\nwho is still with us with eyes lifted to to-morrow's sun, that heralds\nin the new age.\n\n     * Du Bois, the present librarian of Ardis, is a lineal\n     descendant of this revolutionary pair.\n\nThe two girls arrived in a flurry of excitement, danger, and sudden\ndeath. In the crew of the fishing boat that conveyed them across San\nPablo Bay was a spy. A creature of the Iron Heel, he had successfully\nmasqueraded as a revolutionist and penetrated deep into the secrets\nof our organization. Without doubt he was on my trail, for we had long\nsince learned that my disappearance had been cause of deep concern to\nthe secret service of the Oligarchy. Luckily, as the outcome proved, he\nhad not divulged his discoveries to any one. He had evidently delayed\nreporting, preferring to wait until he had brought things to a\nsuccessful conclusion by discovering my hiding-place and capturing me.\nHis information died with him. Under some pretext, after the girls had\nlanded at Petaluma Creek and taken to the horses, he managed to get away\nfrom the boat.\n\nPart way up Sonoma Mountain, John Carlson let the girls go on, leading\nhis horse, while he went back on foot. His suspicions had been aroused.\nHe captured the spy, and as to what then happened, Carlson gave us a\nfair idea.\n\n\"I fixed him,\" was Carlson's unimaginative way of describing the affair.\n\"I fixed him,\" he repeated, while a sombre light burnt in his eyes, and\nhis huge, toil-distorted hands opened and closed eloquently. \"He made no\nnoise. I hid him, and tonight I will go back and bury him deep.\"\n\nDuring that period I used to marvel at my own metamorphosis. At times it\nseemed impossible, either that I had ever lived a placid, peaceful life\nin a college town, or else that I had become a revolutionist inured to\nscenes of violence and death. One or the other could not be. One was\nreal, the other was a dream, but which was which? Was this present\nlife of a revolutionist, hiding in a hole, a nightmare? or was I a\nrevolutionist who had somewhere, somehow, dreamed that in some former\nexistence I have lived in Berkeley and never known of life more violent\nthan teas and dances, debating societies, and lectures rooms? But then I\nsuppose this was a common experience of all of us who had rallied under\nthe red banner of the brotherhood of man.\n\nI often remembered figures from that other life, and, curiously enough,\nthey appeared and disappeared, now and again, in my new life. There was\nBishop Morehouse. In vain we searched for him after our organization had\ndeveloped. He had been transferred from asylum to asylum. We traced him\nfrom the state hospital for the insane at Napa to the one in Stockton,\nand from there to the one in the Santa Clara Valley called Agnews, and\nthere the trail ceased. There was no record of his death. In some way he\nmust have escaped. Little did I dream of the awful manner in which I\nwas to see him once again--the fleeting glimpse of him in the whirlwind\ncarnage of the Chicago Commune.\n\nJackson, who had lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and who had been the\ncause of my own conversion into a revolutionist, I never saw again;\nbut we all knew what he did before he died. He never joined the\nrevolutionists. Embittered by his fate, brooding over his wrongs, he\nbecame an anarchist--not a philosophic anarchist, but a mere animal, mad\nwith hate and lust for revenge. And well he revenged himself. Evading\nthe guards, in the nighttime while all were asleep, he blew the\nPertonwaithe palace into atoms. Not a soul escaped, not even the guards.\nAnd in prison, while awaiting trial, he suffocated himself under his\nblankets.\n\nDr. Hammerfield and Dr. Ballingford achieved quite different fates from\nthat of Jackson. They have been faithful to their salt, and they have\nbeen correspondingly rewarded with ecclesiastical palaces wherein they\ndwell at peace with the world. Both are apologists for the Oligarchy.\nBoth have grown very fat. \"Dr. Hammerfield,\" as Ernest once said, \"has\nsucceeded in modifying his metaphysics so as to give God's sanction to\nthe Iron Heel, and also to include much worship of beauty and to reduce\nto an invisible wraith the gaseous vertebrate described by Haeckel--the\ndifference between Dr. Hammerfield and Dr. Ballingford being that the\nlatter has made the God of the oligarchs a little more gaseous and a\nlittle less vertebrate.\"\n\nPeter Donnelly, the scab foreman at the Sierra Mills whom I encountered\nwhile investigating the case of Jackson, was a surprise to all of us. In\n1918 I was present at a meeting of the 'Frisco Reds. Of all our Fighting\nGroups this one was the most formidable, ferocious, and merciless. It\nwas really not a part of our organization. Its members were fanatics,\nmadmen. We dared not encourage such a spirit. On the other hand, though\nthey did not belong to us, we remained on friendly terms with them. It\nwas a matter of vital importance that brought me there that night. I,\nalone in the midst of a score of men, was the only person unmasked.\nAfter the business that brought me there was transacted, I was led\naway by one of them. In a dark passage this guide struck a match, and,\nholding it close to his face, slipped back his mask. For a moment I\ngazed upon the passion-wrought features of Peter Donnelly. Then the\nmatch went out.\n\n\"I just wanted you to know it was me,\" he said in the darkness. \"D'you\nremember Dallas, the superintendent?\"\n\nI nodded at recollection of the vulpine-face superintendent of the\nSierra Mills.\n\n\"Well, I got him first,\" Donnelly said with pride. \"'Twas after that I\njoined the Reds.\"\n\n\"But how comes it that you are here?\" I queried. \"Your wife and\nchildren?\"\n\n\"Dead,\" he answered. \"That's why. No,\" he went on hastily, \"'tis not\nrevenge for them. They died easily in their beds--sickness, you see,\none time and another. They tied my arms while they lived. And now that\nthey're gone, 'tis revenge for my blasted manhood I'm after. I was\nonce Peter Donnelly, the scab foreman. But to-night I'm Number 27 of the\n'Frisco Reds. Come on now, and I'll get you out of this.\"\n\nMore I heard of him afterward. In his own way he had told the truth\nwhen he said all were dead. But one lived, Timothy, and him his father\nconsidered dead because he had taken service with the Iron Heel in the\nMercenaries.* A member of the 'Frisco Reds pledged himself to twelve\nannual executions. The penalty for failure was death. A member who\nfailed to complete his number committed suicide. These executions were\nnot haphazard. This group of madmen met frequently and passed wholesale\njudgments upon offending members and servitors of the Oligarchy. The\nexecutions were afterward apportioned by lot.\n\n     * In addition to the labor castes, there arose another\n     caste, the military.  A standing army of professional\n     soldiers was created, officered by members of the Oligarchy\n     and known as the Mercenaries. This institution took the\n     place of the militia, which had proved impracticable under\n     the new regime.  Outside the regular secret service of the\n     Iron Heel, there was further established a secret service of\n     the Mercenaries, this latter forming a connecting link\n     between the police and the military.\n\nIn fact, the business that brought me there the night of my visit was\nsuch a trial. One of our own comrades, who for years had successfully\nmaintained himself in a clerical position in the local bureau of the\nsecret service of the Iron Heel, had fallen under the ban of the 'Frisco\nReds and was being tried. Of course he was not present, and of course\nhis judges did not know that he was one of our men. My mission had been\nto testify to his identity and loyalty. It may be wondered how we came\nto know of the affair at all. The explanation is simple. One of our\nsecret agents was a member of the 'Frisco Reds. It was necessary for us\nto keep an eye on friend as well as foe, and this group of madmen was\nnot too unimportant to escape our surveillance.\n\nBut to return to Peter Donnelly and his son. All went well with Donnelly\nuntil, in the following year, he found among the sheaf of executions\nthat fell to him the name of Timothy Donnelly. Then it was that that\nclannishness, which was his to so extraordinary a degree, asserted\nitself. To save his son, he betrayed his comrades. In this he was\npartially blocked, but a dozen of the 'Frisco Reds were executed, and\nthe group was well-nigh destroyed. In retaliation, the survivors meted\nout to Donnelly the death he had earned by his treason.\n\nNor did Timothy Donnelly long survive. The 'Frisco Reds pledged\nthemselves to his execution. Every effort was made by the Oligarchy to\nsave him. He was transferred from one part of the country to another.\nThree of the Reds lost their lives in vain efforts to get him. The Group\nwas composed only of men. In the end they fell back on a woman, one\nof our comrades, and none other than Anna Roylston. Our Inner\nCircle forbade her, but she had ever a will of her own and disdained\ndiscipline. Furthermore, she was a genius and lovable, and we could\nnever discipline her anyway. She is in a class by herself and not\namenable to the ordinary standards of the revolutionists.\n\nDespite our refusal to grant permission to do the deed, she went on with\nit. Now Anna Roylston was a fascinating woman. All she had to do was\nto beckon a man to her. She broke the hearts of scores of our young\ncomrades, and scores of others she captured, and by their heart-strings\nled into our organization. Yet she steadfastly refused to marry. She\ndearly loved children, but she held that a child of her own would claim\nher from the Cause, and that it was the Cause to which her life was\ndevoted.\n\nIt was an easy task for Anna Roylston to win Timothy Donnelly. Her\nconscience did not trouble her, for at that very time occurred the\nNashville Massacre, when the Mercenaries, Donnelly in command, literally\nmurdered eight hundred weavers of that city. But she did not kill\nDonnelly. She turned him over, a prisoner, to the 'Frisco Reds.\nThis happened only last year, and now she had been renamed. The\nrevolutionists everywhere are calling her the \"Red Virgin.\"*\n\n     * It was not until the Second Revolt was crushed, that the\n     'Frisco Reds flourished again.  And for two generations the\n     Group flourished.  Then an agent of the Iron Heel managed to\n     become a member, penetrated all its secrets, and brought\n     about its total annihilation.  This occurred in 2002 A.D.\n     The members were executed one at a time, at intervals of\n     three weeks, and their bodies exposed in the labor-ghetto of\n     San Francisco.\n\nColonel Ingram and Colonel Van Gilbert are two more familiar figures\nthat I was later to encounter. Colonel Ingram rose high in the Oligarchy\nand became Minister to Germany. He was cordially detested by the\nproletariat of both countries. It was in Berlin that I met him, where,\nas an accredited international spy of the Iron Heel, I was received by\nhim and afforded much assistance. Incidentally, I may state that in my\ndual role I managed a few important things for the Revolution.\n\nColonel Van Gilbert became known as \"Snarling\" Van Gilbert. His\nimportant part was played in drafting the new code after the Chicago\nCommune. But before that, as trial judge, he had earned sentence of\ndeath by his fiendish malignancy. I was one of those that tried him and\npassed sentence upon him. Anna Roylston carried out the execution.\n\nStill another figure arises out of the old life--Jackson's lawyer. Least\nof all would I have expected again to meet this man, Joseph Hurd. It was\na strange meeting. Late at night, two years after the Chicago Commune,\nErnest and I arrived together at the Benton Harbor refuge. This was\nin Michigan, across the lake from Chicago. We arrived just at the\nconclusion of the trial of a spy. Sentence of death had been passed, and\nhe was being led away. Such was the scene as we came upon it. The next\nmoment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors and flung\nhimself at my feet, his arms clutching me about the knees in a vicelike\ngrip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy. As he turned his agonized face\nup to me, I recognized him as Joseph Hurd. Of all the terrible things\nI have witnessed, never have I been so unnerved as by this frantic\ncreature's pleading for life. He was mad for life. It was pitiable. He\nrefused to let go of me, despite the hands of a dozen comrades. And when\nat last he was dragged shrieking away, I sank down fainting upon the\nfloor. It is far easier to see brave men die than to hear a coward beg\nfor life.*\n\n     * The Benton Harbor refuge was a catacomb, the entrance of\n     which was cunningly contrived by way of a well.  It has been\n     maintained in a fair state of preservation, and the curious\n     visitor may to-day tread its labyrinths to the assembly\n     hall, where, without doubt, occurred the scene described by\n     Avis Everhard.  Farther on are the cells where the prisoners\n     were confined, and the death chamber where the executions\n     took place.  Beyond is the cemetery--long, winding galleries\n     hewn out of the solid rock, with recesses on either hand,\n     wherein, tier above tier, lie the revolutionists just as\n     they were laid away by their comrades long years agone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA LOST OLIGARCH\n\n\nBut in remembering the old life I have run ahead of my story into the\nnew life. The wholesale jail delivery did not occur until well along\ninto 1915. Complicated as it was, it was carried through without a\nhitch, and as a very creditable achievement it cheered us on in our\nwork. From Cuba to California, out of scores of jails, military prisons,\nand fortresses, in a single night, we delivered fifty-one of our\nfifty-two Congressmen, and in addition over three hundred other leaders.\nThere was not a single instance of miscarriage. Not only did they\nescape, but every one of them won to the refuges as planned. The one\ncomrade Congressman we did not get was Arthur Simpson, and he had\nalready died in Cabanas after cruel tortures.\n\nThe eighteen months that followed was perhaps the happiest of my life\nwith Ernest. During that time we were never apart. Later, when we went\nback into the world, we were separated much. Not more impatiently do I\nawait the flame of to-morrow's revolt than did I that night await the\ncoming of Ernest. I had not seen him for so long, and the thought of a\npossible hitch or error in our plans that would keep him still in his\nisland prison almost drove me mad. The hours passed like ages. I was\nall alone. Biedenbach, and three young men who had been living in the\nrefuge, were out and over the mountain, heavily armed and prepared for\nanything. The refuges all over the land were quite empty, I imagine, of\ncomrades that night.\n\nJust as the sky paled with the first warning of dawn, I heard the\nsignal from above and gave the answer. In the darkness I almost embraced\nBiedenbach, who came down first; but the next moment I was in Ernest's\narms. And in that moment, so complete had been my transformation, I\ndiscovered it was only by an effort of will that I could be the old Avis\nEverhard, with the old mannerisms and smiles, phrases and intonations of\nvoice. It was by strong effort only that I was able to maintain my\nold identity; I could not allow myself to forget for an instant, so\nautomatically imperative had become the new personality I had created.\n\nOnce inside the little cabin, I saw Ernest's face in the light. With the\nexception of the prison pallor, there was no change in him--at least,\nnot much. He was my same lover-husband and hero. And yet there was a\ncertain ascetic lengthening of the lines of his face. But he could well\nstand it, for it seemed to add a certain nobility of refinement to the\nriotous excess of life that had always marked his features. He might\nhave been a trifle graver than of yore, but the glint of laughter still\nwas in his eyes. He was twenty pounds lighter, but in splendid\nphysical condition. He had kept up exercise during the whole period of\nconfinement, and his muscles were like iron. In truth, he was in better\ncondition than when he had entered prison. Hours passed before his head\ntouched pillow and I had soothed him off to sleep. But there was no\nsleep for me. I was too happy, and the fatigue of jail-breaking and\nriding horseback had not been mine.\n\nWhile Ernest slept, I changed my dress, arranged my hair differently,\nand came back to my new automatic self. Then, when Biedenbach and the\nother comrades awoke, with their aid I concocted a little conspiracy.\nAll was ready, and we were in the cave-room that served for kitchen\nand dining room when Ernest opened the door and entered. At that moment\nBiedenbach addressed me as Mary, and I turned and answered him. Then I\nglanced at Ernest with curious interest, such as any young comrade might\nbetray on seeing for the first time so noted a hero of the Revolution.\nBut Ernest's glance took me in and questioned impatiently past and\naround the room. The next moment I was being introduced to him as Mary\nHolmes.\n\nTo complete the deception, an extra plate was laid, and when we sat down\nto table one chair was not occupied. I could have cried with joy as I\nnoted Ernest's increasing uneasiness and impatience. Finally he could\nstand it no longer.\n\n\"Where's my wife?\" he demanded bluntly.\n\n\"She is still asleep,\" I answered.\n\nIt was the crucial moment. But my voice was a strange voice, and in it\nhe recognized nothing familiar. The meal went on. I talked a great\ndeal, and enthusiastically, as a hero-worshipper might talk, and it\nwas obvious that he was my hero. I rose to a climax of enthusiasm and\nworship, and, before he could guess my intention, threw my arms around\nhis neck and kissed him on the lips. He held me from him at arm's length\nand stared about in annoyance and perplexity. The four men greeted him\nwith roars of laughter, and explanations were made. At first he was\nsceptical. He scrutinized me keenly and was half convinced, then shook\nhis head and would not believe. It was not until I became the old Avis\nEverhard and whispered secrets in his ear that none knew but he and Avis\nEverhard, that he accepted me as his really, truly wife.\n\nIt was later in the day that he took me in his arms, manifesting great\nembarrassment and claiming polygamous emotions.\n\n\"You are my Avis,\" he said, \"and you are also some one else. You are two\nwomen, and therefore you are my harem. At any rate, we are safe now.\nIf the United States becomes too hot for us, why I have qualified for\ncitizenship in Turkey.\"*\n\n     * At that time polygamy was still practised in Turkey.\n\nLife became for me very happy in the refuge. It is true, we worked\nhard and for long hours; but we worked together. We had each other for\neighteen precious months, and we were not lonely, for there was always\na coming and going of leaders and comrades--strange voices from the\nunder-world of intrigue and revolution, bringing stranger tales of\nstrife and war from all our battle-line. And there was much fun and\ndelight. We were not mere gloomy conspirators. We toiled hard and\nsuffered greatly, filled the gaps in our ranks and went on, and through\nall the labour and the play and interplay of life and death we found\ntime to laugh and love. There were artists, scientists, scholars,\nmusicians, and poets among us; and in that hole in the ground culture\nwas higher and finer than in the palaces of wonder-cities of the\noligarchs. In truth, many of our comrades toiled at making beautiful\nthose same palaces and wonder-cities.*\n\n     * This is not braggadocio on the part of Avis Everhard.  The\n     flower of the artistic and intellectual world were\n     revolutionists.  With the exception of a few of the\n     musicians and singers, and of a few of the oligarchs, all\n     the great creators of the period whose names have come down\n     to us, were revolutionists.\n\nNor were we confined to the refuge itself. Often at night we rode over\nthe mountains for exercise, and we rode on Wickson's horses. If only he\nknew how many revolutionists his horses have carried! We even went on\npicnics to isolated spots we knew, where we remained all day, going\nbefore daylight and returning after dark. Also, we used Wickson's cream\nand butter,* and Ernest was not above shooting Wickson's quail and\nrabbits, and, on occasion, his young bucks.\n\n     * Even as late as that period, cream and butter were still\n     crudely extracted from cow's milk.  The laboratory\n     preparation of foods had not yet begun.\n\nIndeed, it was a safe refuge. I have said that it was discovered only\nonce, and this brings me to the clearing up of the mystery of the\ndisappearance of young Wickson. Now that he is dead, I am free to speak.\nThere was a nook on the bottom of the great hole where the sun shone for\nseveral hours and which was hidden from above. Here we had carried\nmany loads of gravel from the creek-bed, so that it was dry and warm,\na pleasant basking place; and here, one afternoon, I was drowsing, half\nasleep, over a volume of Mendenhall.* I was so comfortable and secure\nthat even his flaming lyrics failed to stir me.\n\n     * In all the extant literature and documents of that period,\n     continual reference is made to the poems of Rudolph\n     Mendenhall.  By his comrades he was called \"The Flame.\"  He\n     was undoubtedly a great genius; yet, beyond weird and\n     haunting fragments of his verse, quoted in the writings of\n     others, nothing of his has come down to us.  He was executed\n     by the Iron Heel in 1928 A.D.\n\nI was aroused by a clod of earth striking at my feet. Then from above,\nI heard a sound of scrambling. The next moment a young man, with a\nfinal slide down the crumbling wall, alighted at my feet. It was Philip\nWickson, though I did not know him at the time. He looked at me coolly\nand uttered a low whistle of surprise.\n\n\"Well,\" he said; and the next moment, cap in hand, he was saying, \"I beg\nyour pardon. I did not expect to find any one here.\"\n\nI was not so cool. I was still a tyro so far as concerned knowing how to\nbehave in desperate circumstances. Later on, when I was an international\nspy, I should have been less clumsy, I am sure. As it was, I scrambled\nto my feet and cried out the danger call.\n\n\"Why did you do that?\" he asked, looking at me searchingly.\n\nIt was evident that he had no suspicion of our presence when making the\ndescent. I recognized this with relief.\n\n\"For what purpose do you think I did it?\" I countered. I was indeed\nclumsy in those days.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered, shaking his head. \"Unless you've got\nfriends about. Anyway, you've got some explanations to make. I don't\nlike the look of it. You are trespassing. This is my father's land,\nand--\"\n\nBut at that moment, Biedenbach, every polite and gentle, said from\nbehind him in a low voice, \"Hands up, my young sir.\"\n\nYoung Wickson put his hands up first, then turned to confront\nBiedenbach, who held a thirty-thirty automatic rifle on him. Wickson was\nimperturbable.\n\n\"Oh, ho,\" he said, \"a nest of revolutionists--and quite a hornet's nest\nit would seem. Well, you won't abide here long, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'll abide here long enough to reconsider that statement,\"\nBiedenbach said quietly. \"And in the meanwhile I must ask you to come\ninside with me.\"\n\n\"Inside?\" The young man was genuinely astonished. \"Have you a catacomb\nhere? I have heard of such things.\"\n\n\"Come and see,\" Biedenbach answered with his adorable accent.\n\n\"But it is unlawful,\" was the protest.\n\n\"Yes, by your law,\" the terrorist replied significantly. \"But by our\nlaw, believe me, it is quite lawful. You must accustom yourself to\nthe fact that you are in another world than the one of oppression and\nbrutality in which you have lived.\"\n\n\"There is room for argument there,\" Wickson muttered.\n\n\"Then stay with us and discuss it.\"\n\nThe young fellow laughed and followed his captor into the house. He\nwas led into the inner cave-room, and one of the young comrades left to\nguard him, while we discussed the situation in the kitchen.\n\nBiedenbach, with tears in his eyes, held that Wickson must die, and was\nquite relieved when we outvoted him and his horrible proposition. On the\nother hand, we could not dream of allowing the young oligarch to depart.\n\n\"I'll tell you what to do,\" Ernest said. \"We'll keep him and give him an\neducation.\"\n\n\"I bespeak the privilege, then, of enlightening him in jurisprudence,\"\nBiedenbach cried.\n\nAnd so a decision was laughingly reached. We would keep Philip Wickson\na prisoner and educate him in our ethics and sociology. But in the\nmeantime there was work to be done. All trace of the young oligarch must\nbe obliterated. There were the marks he had left when descending the\ncrumbling wall of the hole. This task fell to Biedenbach, and, slung on\na rope from above, he toiled cunningly for the rest of the day till no\nsign remained. Back up the canyon from the lip of the hole all marks\nwere likewise removed. Then, at twilight, came John Carlson, who\ndemanded Wickson's shoes.\n\nThe young man did not want to give up his shoes, and even offered to\nfight for them, till he felt the horseshoer's strength in Ernest's\nhands. Carlson afterward reported several blisters and much grievous\nloss of skin due to the smallness of the shoes, but he succeeded in\ndoing gallant work with them. Back from the lip of the hole, where ended\nthe young man's obliterated trial, Carlson put on the shoes and walked\naway to the left. He walked for miles, around knolls, over ridges and\nthrough canyons, and finally covered the trail in the running water of\na creek-bed. Here he removed the shoes, and, still hiding trail for a\ndistance, at last put on his own shoes. A week later Wickson got back\nhis shoes.\n\nThat night the hounds were out, and there was little sleep in the\nrefuge. Next day, time and again, the baying hounds came down the\ncanyon, plunged off to the left on the trail Carlson had made for them,\nand were lost to ear in the farther canyons high up the mountain. And\nall the time our men waited in the refuge, weapons in hand--automatic\nrevolvers and rifles, to say nothing of half a dozen infernal machines\nof Biedenbach's manufacture. A more surprised party of rescuers could\nnot be imagined, had they ventured down into our hiding-place.\n\nI have now given the true disappearance of Philip Wickson, one-time\noligarch, and, later, comrade in the Revolution. For we converted him\nin the end. His mind was fresh and plastic, and by nature he was very\nethical. Several months later we rode him, on one of his father's\nhorses, over Sonoma Mountains to Petaluma Creek and embarked him in\na small fishing-launch. By easy stages we smuggled him along our\nunderground railway to the Carmel refuge.\n\nThere he remained eight months, at the end of which time, for two\nreasons, he was loath to leave us. One reason was that he had fallen in\nlove with Anna Roylston, and the other was that he had become one of\nus. It was not until he became convinced of the hopelessness of his\nlove affair that he acceded to our wishes and went back to his father.\nOstensibly an oligarch until his death, he was in reality one of the\nmost valuable of our agents. Often and often has the Iron Heel been\ndumbfounded by the miscarriage of its plans and operations against us.\nIf it but knew the number of its own members who are our agents, it\nwould understand. Young Wickson never wavered in his loyalty to the\nCause. In truth, his very death was incurred by his devotion to duty.\nIn the great storm of 1927, while attending a meeting of our leaders, he\ncontracted the pneumonia of which he died.*\n\n     * The case of this young man was not unusual.  Many young\n     men of the Oligarchy, impelled by sense of right conduct, or\n     their imaginations captured by the glory of the Revolution,\n     ethically or romantically devoted their lives to it.  In\n     similar way, many sons of the Russian nobility played their\n     parts in the earlier and protracted revolution in that\n     country.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST\n\n\nDuring the long period of our stay in the refuge, we were kept closely\nin touch with what was happening in the world without, and we were\nlearning thoroughly the strength of the Oligarchy with which we were\nat war. Out of the flux of transition the new institutions were\nforming more definitely and taking on the appearance and attributes\nof permanence. The oligarchs had succeeded in devising a governmental\nmachine, as intricate as it was vast, that worked--and this despite all\nour efforts to clog and hamper.\n\nThis was a surprise to many of the revolutionists. They had not\nconceived it possible. Nevertheless the work of the country went on.\nThe men toiled in the mines and fields--perforce they were no more than\nslaves. As for the vital industries, everything prospered. The members\nof the great labor castes were contented and worked on merrily. For the\nfirst time in their lives they knew industrial peace. No more were they\nworried by slack times, strike and lockout, and the union label. They\nlived in more comfortable homes and in delightful cities of their\nown--delightful compared with the slums and ghettos in which they had\nformerly dwelt. They had better food to eat, less hours of labor, more\nholidays, and a greater amount and variety of interests and pleasures.\nAnd for their less fortunate brothers and sisters, the unfavored\nlaborers, the driven people of the abyss, they cared nothing. An age\nof selfishness was dawning upon mankind. And yet this is not altogether\ntrue. The labor castes were honeycombed by our agents--men whose\neyes saw, beyond the belly-need, the radiant figure of liberty and\nbrotherhood.\n\nAnother great institution that had taken form and was working smoothly\nwas the Mercenaries. This body of soldiers had been evolved out of the\nold regular army and was now a million strong, to say nothing of the\ncolonial forces. The Mercenaries constituted a race apart. They dwelt in\ncities of their own which were practically self-governed, and they\nwere granted many privileges. By them a large portion of the perplexing\nsurplus was consumed. They were losing all touch and sympathy with\nthe rest of the people, and, in fact, were developing their own class\nmorality and consciousness. And yet we had thousands of our agents among\nthem.*\n\n     * The Mercenaries, in the last days of the Iron Heel, played\n     an important role.  They constituted the balance of power in\n     the struggles between the labor castes and the oligarchs,\n     and now to one side and now to the other, threw their\n     strength according to the play of intrigue and conspiracy.\n\nThe oligarchs themselves were going through a remarkable and, it must\nbe confessed, unexpected development. As a class, they disciplined\nthemselves. Every member had his work to do in the world, and this work\nhe was compelled to do. There were no more idle-rich young men. Their\nstrength was used to give united strength to the Oligarchy. They served\nas leaders of troops and as lieutenants and captains of industry.\nThey found careers in applied science, and many of them became great\nengineers. They went into the multitudinous divisions of the government,\ntook service in the colonial possessions, and by tens of thousands went\ninto the various secret services. They were, I may say, apprenticed\nto education, to art, to the church, to science, to literature; and\nin those fields they served the important function of moulding the\nthought-processes of the nation in the direction of the perpetuity of\nthe Oligarchy.\n\nThey were taught, and later they in turn taught, that what they were\ndoing was right. They assimilated the aristocratic idea from the moment\nthey began, as children, to receive impressions of the world. The\naristocratic idea was woven into the making of them until it became bone\nof them and flesh of them. They looked upon themselves as wild-animal\ntrainers, rulers of beasts. From beneath their feet rose always the\nsubterranean rumbles of revolt. Violent death ever stalked in their\nmidst; bomb and knife and bullet were looked upon as so many fangs\nof the roaring abysmal beast they must dominate if humanity were\nto persist. They were the saviours of humanity, and they regarded\nthemselves as heroic and sacrificing laborers for the highest good.\n\nThey, as a class, believed that they alone maintained civilization.\nIt was their belief that if ever they weakened, the great beast would\ningulf them and everything of beauty and wonder and joy and good in its\ncavernous and slime-dripping maw. Without them, anarchy would reign and\nhumanity would drop backward into the primitive night out of which it\nhad so painfully emerged. The horrid picture of anarchy was held\nalways before their child's eyes until they, in turn, obsessed by this\ncultivated fear, held the picture of anarchy before the eyes of the\nchildren that followed them. This was the beast to be stamped upon, and\nthe highest duty of the aristocrat was to stamp upon it. In short,\nthey alone, by their unremitting toil and sacrifice, stood between\nweak humanity and the all-devouring beast; and they believed it, firmly\nbelieved it.\n\nI cannot lay too great stress upon this high ethical righteousness of\nthe whole oligarch class. This has been the strength of the Iron Heel,\nand too many of the comrades have been slow or loath to realize it. Many\nof them have ascribed the strength of the Iron Heel to its system of\nreward and punishment. This is a mistake. Heaven and hell may be the\nprime factors of zeal in the religion of a fanatic; but for the great\nmajority of the religious, heaven and hell are incidental to right\nand wrong. Love of the right, desire for the right, unhappiness with\nanything less than the right--in short, right conduct, is the prime\nfactor of religion. And so with the Oligarchy. Prisons, banishment and\ndegradation, honors and palaces and wonder-cities, are all incidental.\nThe great driving force of the oligarchs is the belief that they are\ndoing right. Never mind the exceptions, and never mind the oppression\nand injustice in which the Iron Heel was conceived. All is granted. The\npoint is that the strength of the Oligarchy today lies in its satisfied\nconception of its own righteousness.*\n\n     * Out of the ethical incoherency and inconsistency of\n     capitalism, the oligarchs emerged with a new ethics,\n     coherent and definite, sharp and severe as steel, the most\n     absurd and unscientific and at the same time the most potent\n     ever possessed by any tyrant class. The oligarchs believed\n     their ethics, in spite of the fact that biology and\n     evolution gave them the lie; and, because of their faith,\n     for three centuries they were able to hold back the mighty\n     tide of human progress--a spectacle, profound, tremendous,\n     puzzling to the metaphysical moralist, and one that to the\n     materialist is the cause of many doubts and\n     reconsiderations.\n\nFor that matter, the strength of the Revolution, during these\nfrightful twenty years, has resided in nothing else than the sense\nof righteousness. In no other way can be explained our sacrifices and\nmartyrdoms. For no other reason did Rudolph Mendenhall flame out his\nsoul for the Cause and sing his wild swan-song that last night of life.\nFor no other reason did Hurlbert die under torture, refusing to the last\nto betray his comrades. For no other reason has Anna Roylston refused\nblessed motherhood. For no other reason has John Carlson been the\nfaithful and unrewarded custodian of the Glen Ellen Refuge. It does\nnot matter, young or old, man or woman, high or low, genius or clod,\ngo where one will among the comrades of the Revolution, the motor-force\nwill be found to be a great and abiding desire for the right.\n\nBut I have run away from my narrative. Ernest and I well understood,\nbefore we left the refuge, how the strength of the Iron Heel was\ndeveloping. The labor castes, the Mercenaries, and the great hordes\nof secret agents and police of various sorts were all pledged to the\nOligarchy. In the main, and ignoring the loss of liberty, they were\nbetter off than they had been. On the other hand, the great helpless\nmass of the population, the people of the abyss, was sinking into a\nbrutish apathy of content with misery. Whenever strong proletarians\nasserted their strength in the midst of the mass, they were drawn away\nfrom the mass by the oligarchs and given better conditions by being made\nmembers of the labor castes or of the Mercenaries. Thus discontent was\nlulled and the proletariat robbed of its natural leaders.\n\nThe condition of the people of the abyss was pitiable. Common school\neducation, so far as they were concerned, had ceased. They lived\nlike beasts in great squalid labor-ghettos, festering in misery and\ndegradation. All their old liberties were gone. They were labor-slaves.\nChoice of work was denied them. Likewise was denied them the right to\nmove from place to place, or the right to bear or possess arms. They\nwere not land serfs like the farmers. They were machine-serfs and\nlabor-serfs. When unusual needs arose for them, such as the building\nof the great highways and air-lines, of canals, tunnels, subways, and\nfortifications, levies were made on the labor-ghettos, and tens of\nthousands of serfs, willy-nilly, were transported to the scene of\noperations. Great armies of them are toiling now at the building of\nArdis, housed in wretched barracks where family life cannot exist, and\nwhere decency is displaced by dull bestiality. In all truth, there in\nthe labor-ghettos is the roaring abysmal beast the oligarchs fear so\ndreadfully--but it is the beast of their own making. In it they will not\nlet the ape and tiger die.\n\nAnd just now the word has gone forth that new levies are being imposed\nfor the building of Asgard, the projected wonder-city that will far\nexceed Ardis when the latter is completed.* We of the Revolution will go\non with that great work, but it will not be done by the miserable serfs.\nThe walls and towers and shafts of that fair city will arise to the\nsound of singing, and into its beauty and wonder will be woven, not\nsighs and groans, but music and laughter.\n\n     * Ardis was completed in 1942 A.D., Asgard was not completed\n     until 1984 A.D.  It was fifty-two years in the building,\n     during which time a permanent army of half a million serfs\n     was employed.  At times these numbers swelled to over a\n     million--without any account being taken of the hundreds of\n     thousands of the labor castes and the artists.\n\nErnest was madly impatient to be out in the world and doing, for our\nill-fated First Revolt, that had miscarried in the Chicago Commune, was\nripening fast. Yet he possessed his soul with patience, and during this\ntime of his torment, when Hadly, who had been brought for the purpose\nfrom Illinois, made him over into another man* he revolved great plans\nin his head for the organization of the learned proletariat, and for the\nmaintenance of at least the rudiments of education amongst the people of\nthe abyss--all this of course in the event of the First Revolt being a\nfailure.\n\n     * Among the Revolutionists were many surgeons, and in\n     vivisection they attained marvellous proficiency.  In Avis\n     Everhard's words, they could literally make a man over.  To\n     them the elimination of scars and disfigurements was a\n     trivial detail.  They changed the features with such\n     microscopic care that no traces were left of their\n     handiwork.  The nose was a favorite organ to work upon.\n     Skin-grafting and hair-transplanting were among their\n     commonest devices.  The changes in expression they\n     accomplished were wizard-like.  Eyes and eyebrows, lips,\n     mouths, and ears, were radically altered.  By cunning\n     operations on tongue, throat, larynx, and nasal cavities a\n     man's whole enunciation and manner of speech could be\n     changed.  Desperate times give need for desperate remedies,\n     and the surgeons of the Revolution rose to the need.  Among\n     other things, they could increase an adult's stature by as\n     much as four or five inches and decrease it by one or two\n     inches.  What they did is to-day a lost art.  We have no\n     need for it.\n\nIt was not until January, 1917, that we left the refuge. All had been\narranged. We took our place at once as agents-provocateurs in the scheme\nof the Iron Heel. I was supposed to be Ernest's sister. By oligarchs and\ncomrades on the inside who were high in authority, place had been made\nfor us, we were in possession of all necessary documents, and our pasts\nwere accounted for. With help on the inside, this was not difficult,\nfor in that shadow-world of secret service identity was nebulous. Like\nghosts the agents came and went, obeying commands, fulfilling duties,\nfollowing clews, making their reports often to officers they never saw\nor cooperating with other agents they had never seen before and would\nnever see again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE CHICAGO COMMUNE\n\n\nAs agents-provocateurs, not alone were we able to travel a great deal,\nbut our very work threw us in contact with the proletariat and with our\ncomrades, the revolutionists. Thus we were in both camps at the same\ntime, ostensibly serving the Iron Heel and secretly working with all\nour might for the Cause. There were many of us in the various\nsecret services of the Oligarchy, and despite the shakings-up and\nreorganizations the secret services have undergone, they have never been\nable to weed all of us out.\n\nErnest had largely planned the First Revolt, and the date set had been\nsomewhere early in the spring of 1918. In the fall of 1917 we were not\nready; much remained to be done, and when the Revolt was precipitated,\nof course it was doomed to failure. The plot of necessity was\nfrightfully intricate, and anything premature was sure to destroy it.\nThis the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly.\n\nWe had planned to strike our first blow at the nervous system of the\nOligarchy. The latter had remembered the general strike, and had\nguarded against the defection of the telegraphers by installing wireless\nstations, in the control of the Mercenaries. We, in turn, had countered\nthis move. When the signal was given, from every refuge, all over the\nland, and from the cities, and towns, and barracks, devoted comrades\nwere to go forth and blow up the wireless stations. Thus at the first\nshock would the Iron Heel be brought to earth and lie practically\ndismembered.\n\nAt the same moment, other comrades were to blow up the bridges and\ntunnels and disrupt the whole network of railroads. Still further, other\ngroups of comrades, at the signal, were to seize the officers of the\nMercenaries and the police, as well as all Oligarchs of unusual ability\nor who held executive positions. Thus would the leaders of the enemy\nbe removed from the field of the local battles that would inevitably be\nfought all over the land.\n\nMany things were to occur simultaneously when the signal went forth. The\nCanadian and Mexican patriots, who were far stronger than the Iron Heel\ndreamed, were to duplicate our tactics. Then there were comrades (these\nwere the women, for the men would be busy elsewhere) who were to post\nthe proclamations from our secret presses. Those of us in the higher\nemploy of the Iron Heel were to proceed immediately to make confusion\nand anarchy in all our departments. Inside the Mercenaries were\nthousands of our comrades. Their work was to blow up the magazines\nand to destroy the delicate mechanism of all the war machinery. In the\ncities of the Mercenaries and of the labor castes similar programmes of\ndisruption were to be carried out.\n\nIn short, a sudden, colossal, stunning blow was to be struck. Before the\nparalyzed Oligarchy could recover itself, its end would have come.\nIt would have meant terrible times and great loss of life, but no\nrevolutionist hesitates at such things. Why, we even depended much, in\nour plan, on the unorganized people of the abyss. They were to be loosed\non the palaces and cities of the masters. Never mind the destruction\nof life and property. Let the abysmal brute roar and the police and\nMercenaries slay. The abysmal brute would roar anyway, and the police\nand Mercenaries would slay anyway. It would merely mean that various\ndangers to us were harmlessly destroying one another. In the meantime we\nwould be doing our own work, largely unhampered, and gaining control of\nall the machinery of society.\n\nSuch was our plan, every detail of which had to be worked out in secret,\nand, as the day drew near, communicated to more and more comrades.\nThis was the danger point, the stretching of the conspiracy. But that\ndanger-point was never reached. Through its spy-system the Iron Heel\ngot wind of the Revolt and prepared to teach us another of its bloody\nlessons. Chicago was the devoted city selected for the instruction, and\nwell were we instructed.\n\nChicago* was the ripest of all--Chicago which of old time was the city\nof blood and which was to earn anew its name. There the revolutionary\nspirit was strong. Too many bitter strikes had been curbed there in the\ndays of capitalism for the workers to forget and forgive. Even the\nlabor castes of the city were alive with revolt. Too many heads had\nbeen broken in the early strikes. Despite their changed and favorable\nconditions, their hatred for the master class had not died. This spirit\nhad infected the Mercenaries, of which three regiments in particular\nwere ready to come over to us en masse.\n\n     * Chicago was the industrial inferno of the nineteenth\n     century A.D. A curious anecdote has come down to us of John\n     Burns, a great English labor leader and one time member of\n     the British Cabinet. In Chicago, while on a visit to the\n     United States, he was asked by a newspaper reporter for his\n     opinion of that city.  \"Chicago,\" he answered, \"is a pocket\n     edition of hell.\"  Some time later, as he was going aboard\n     his steamer to sail to England, he was approached by another\n     reporter, who wanted to know if he had changed his opinion\n     of Chicago.  \"Yes, I have,\" was his reply.  \"My present\n     opinion is that hell is a pocket edition of Chicago.\"\n\nChicago had always been the storm-centre of the conflict between\nlabor and capital, a city of street-battles and violent death, with a\nclass-conscious capitalist organization and a class-conscious workman\norganization, where, in the old days, the very school-teachers were\nformed into labor unions and affiliated with the hod-carriers and\nbrick-layers in the American Federation of Labor. And Chicago became the\nstorm-centre of the premature First Revolt.\n\nThe trouble was precipitated by the Iron Heel. It was cleverly done. The\nwhole population, including the favored labor castes, was given a course\nof outrageous treatment. Promises and agreements were broken, and most\ndrastic punishments visited upon even petty offenders. The people of\nthe abyss were tormented out of their apathy. In fact, the Iron Heel was\npreparing to make the abysmal beast roar. And hand in hand with this, in\nall precautionary measures in Chicago, the Iron Heel was inconceivably\ncareless. Discipline was relaxed among the Mercenaries that remained,\nwhile many regiments had been withdrawn and sent to various parts of the\ncountry.\n\nIt did not take long to carry out this programme--only several weeks. We\nof the Revolution caught vague rumors of the state of affairs, but had\nnothing definite enough for an understanding. In fact, we thought it was\na spontaneous spirit of revolt that would require careful curbing on our\npart, and never dreamed that it was deliberately manufactured--and it\nhad been manufactured so secretly, from the very innermost circle of\nthe Iron Heel, that we had got no inkling. The counter-plot was an able\nachievement, and ably carried out.\n\nI was in New York when I received the order to proceed immediately to\nChicago. The man who gave me the order was one of the oligarchs, I could\ntell that by his speech, though I did not know his name nor see his\nface. His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake. Plainly\nI read between the lines that our plot had been discovered, that we had\nbeen countermined. The explosion was ready for the flash of powder, and\ncountless agents of the Iron Heel, including me, either on the ground\nor being sent there, were to supply that flash. I flatter myself that I\nmaintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch, but my heart\nwas beating madly. I could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat\nwith my naked hands before his final, cold-blooded instructions were\ngiven.\n\nOnce out of his presence, I calculated the time. I had just the moments\nto spare, if I were lucky, to get in touch with some local leader before\ncatching my train. Guarding against being trailed, I made a rush of it\nfor the Emergency Hospital. Luck was with me, and I gained access at\nonce to comrade Galvin, the surgeon-in-chief. I started to gasp out my\ninformation, but he stopped me.\n\n\"I already know,\" he said quietly, though his Irish eyes were flashing.\n\"I knew what you had come for. I got the word fifteen minutes ago, and I\nhave already passed it along. Everything shall be done here to keep the\ncomrades quiet. Chicago is to be sacrificed, but it shall be Chicago\nalone.\"\n\n\"Have you tried to get word to Chicago?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head. \"No telegraphic communication. Chicago is shut off.\nIt's going to be hell there.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and I saw his white hands clinch. Then he burst out:\n\n\"By God! I wish I were going to be there!\"\n\n\"There is yet a chance to stop it,\" I said, \"if nothing happens to\nthe train and I can get there in time. Or if some of the other\nsecret-service comrades who have learned the truth can get there in\ntime.\"\n\n\"You on the inside were caught napping this time,\" he said.\n\nI nodded my head humbly.\n\n\"It was very secret,\" I answered. \"Only the inner chiefs could have\nknown up to to-day. We haven't yet penetrated that far, so we couldn't\nescape being kept in the dark. If only Ernest were here. Maybe he is in\nChicago now, and all is well.\"\n\nDr. Galvin shook his head. \"The last news I heard of him was that he had\nbeen sent to Boston or New Haven. This secret service for the enemy must\nhamper him a lot, but it's better than lying in a refuge.\"\n\nI started to go, and Galvin wrung my hand.\n\n\"Keep a stout heart,\" were his parting words. \"What if the First Revolt\nis lost? There will be a second, and we will be wiser then. Good-by and\ngood luck. I don't know whether I'll ever see you again. It's going to\nbe hell there, but I'd give ten years of my life for your chance to be\nin it.\"\n\nThe Twentieth Century* left New York at six in the evening, and was\nsupposed to arrive at Chicago at seven next morning. But it lost time\nthat night. We were running behind another train. Among the travellers\nin my Pullman was comrade Hartman, like myself in the secret service\nof the Iron Heel. He it was who told me of the train that immediately\npreceded us. It was an exact duplicate of our train, though it contained\nno passengers. The idea was that the empty train should receive the\ndisaster were an attempt made to blow up the Twentieth Century. For that\nmatter there were very few people on the train--only a baker's dozen in\nour car.\n\n     * This was reputed to be the fastest train in the world\n     then.  It was quite a famous train.\n\n\"There must be some big men on board,\" Hartman concluded. \"I noticed a\nprivate car on the rear.\"\n\nNight had fallen when we made our first change of engine, and I walked\ndown the platform for a breath of fresh air and to see what I could see.\nThrough the windows of the private car I caught a glimpse of three\nmen whom I recognized. Hartman was right. One of the men was General\nAltendorff; and the other two were Mason and Vanderbold, the brains of\nthe inner circle of the Oligarchy's secret service.\n\nIt was a quiet moonlight night, but I tossed restlessly and could not\nsleep. At five in the morning I dressed and abandoned my bed.\n\nI asked the maid in the dressing-room how late the train was, and she\ntold me two hours. She was a mulatto woman, and I noticed that her\nface was haggard, with great circles under the eyes, while the eyes\nthemselves were wide with some haunting fear.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing, miss; I didn't sleep well, I guess,\" was her reply.\n\nI looked at her closely, and tried her with one of our signals. She\nresponded, and I made sure of her.\n\n\"Something terrible is going to happen in Chicago,\" she said. \"There's\nthat fake* train in front of us. That and the troop-trains have made us\nlate.\"\n\n     * False.\n\n\"Troop-trains?\" I queried.\n\nShe nodded her head. \"The line is thick with them. We've been passing\nthem all night. And they're all heading for Chicago. And bringing them\nover the air-line--that means business.\n\n\"I've a lover in Chicago,\" she added apologetically. \"He's one of us,\nand he's in the Mercenaries, and I'm afraid for him.\"\n\nPoor girl. Her lover was in one of the three disloyal regiments.\n\nHartman and I had breakfast together in the dining car, and I forced\nmyself to eat. The sky had clouded, and the train rushed on like a\nsullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day. The very\nnegroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was impending.\nOppression sat heavily upon them; the lightness of their natures had\nebbed out of them; they were slack and absent-minded in their service,\nand they whispered gloomily to one another in the far end of the car\nnext to the kitchen. Hartman was hopeless over the situation.\n\n\"What can we do?\" he demanded for the twentieth time, with a helpless\nshrug of the shoulders.\n\nHe pointed out of the window. \"See, all is ready. You can depend upon it\nthat they're holding them like this, thirty or forty miles outside the\ncity, on every road.\"\n\nHe had reference to troop-trains on the side-track. The soldiers were\ncooking their breakfasts over fires built on the ground beside the\ntrack, and they looked up curiously at us as we thundered past without\nslackening our terrific speed.\n\nAll was quiet as we entered Chicago. It was evident nothing had happened\nyet. In the suburbs the morning papers came on board the train. There\nwas nothing in them, and yet there was much in them for those skilled\nin reading between the lines that it was intended the ordinary reader\nshould read into the text. The fine hand of the Iron Heel was apparent\nin every column. Glimmerings of weakness in the armor of the Oligarchy\nwere given. Of course, there was nothing definite. It was intended that\nthe reader should feel his way to these glimmerings. It was\ncleverly done. As fiction, those morning papers of October 27th were\nmasterpieces.\n\nThe local news was missing. This in itself was a masterstroke. It\nshrouded Chicago in mystery, and it suggested to the average Chicago\nreader that the Oligarchy did not dare give the local news. Hints that\nwere untrue, of course, were given of insubordination all over the land,\ncrudely disguised with complacent references to punitive measures to be\ntaken. There were reports of numerous wireless stations that had\nbeen blown up, with heavy rewards offered for the detection of the\nperpetrators. Of course no wireless stations had been blown up. Many\nsimilar outrages, that dovetailed with the plot of the revolutionists,\nwere given. The impression to be made on the minds of the Chicago\ncomrades was that the general Revolt was beginning, albeit with a\nconfusing miscarriage in many details. It was impossible for one\nuninformed to escape the vague yet certain feeling that all the land was\nripe for the revolt that had already begun to break out.\n\nIt was reported that the defection of the Mercenaries in California had\nbecome so serious that half a dozen regiments had been disbanded and\nbroken, and that their members with their families had been driven\nfrom their own city and on into the labor-ghettos. And the California\nMercenaries were in reality the most faithful of all to their salt!\nBut how was Chicago, shut off from the rest of the world, to know? Then\nthere was a ragged telegram describing an outbreak of the populace in\nNew York City, in which the labor castes were joining, concluding with\nthe statement (intended to be accepted as a bluff*) that the troops had\nthe situation in hand.\n\n     * A lie.\n\nAnd as the oligarchs had done with the morning papers, so had they done\nin a thousand other ways. These we learned afterward, as, for example,\nthe secret messages of the oligarchs, sent with the express purpose of\nleaking to the ears of the revolutionists, that had come over the wires,\nnow and again, during the first part of the night.\n\n\"I guess the Iron Heel won't need our services,\" Hartman remarked,\nputting down the paper he had been reading, when the train pulled into\nthe central depot. \"They wasted their time sending us here. Their plans\nhave evidently prospered better than they expected. Hell will break\nloose any second now.\"\n\nHe turned and looked down the train as we alighted.\n\n\"I thought so,\" he muttered. \"They dropped that private car when the\npapers came aboard.\"\n\nHartman was hopelessly depressed. I tried to cheer him up, but he\nignored my effort and suddenly began talking very hurriedly, in a\nlow voice, as we passed through the station. At first I could not\nunderstand.\n\n\"I have not been sure,\" he was saying, \"and I have told no one. I have\nbeen working on it for weeks, and I cannot make sure. Watch out for\nKnowlton. I suspect him. He knows the secrets of a score of our refuges.\nHe carries the lives of hundreds of us in his hands, and I think he is\na traitor. It's more a feeling on my part than anything else. But I\nthought I marked a change in him a short while back. There is the danger\nthat he has sold us out, or is going to sell us out. I am almost sure\nof it. I wouldn't whisper my suspicions to a soul, but, somehow, I don't\nthink I'll leave Chicago alive. Keep your eye on Knowlton. Trap him.\nFind out. I don't know anything more. It is only an intuition, and so\nfar I have failed to find the slightest clew.\" We were just stepping out\nupon the sidewalk. \"Remember,\" Hartman concluded earnestly. \"Keep your\neyes upon Knowlton.\"\n\nAnd Hartman was right. Before a month went by Knowlton paid for his\ntreason with his life. He was formally executed by the comrades in\nMilwaukee.\n\nAll was quiet on the streets--too quiet. Chicago lay dead. There was no\nroar and rumble of traffic. There were not even cabs on the streets. The\nsurface cars and the elevated were not running. Only occasionally, on\nthe sidewalks, were there stray pedestrians, and these pedestrians did\nnot loiter. They went their ways with great haste and definiteness,\nwithal there was a curious indecision in their movements, as though they\nexpected the buildings to topple over on them or the sidewalks to sink\nunder their feet or fly up in the air. A few gamins, however, were\naround, in their eyes a suppressed eagerness in anticipation of\nwonderful and exciting things to happen.\n\nFrom somewhere, far to the south, the dull sound of an explosion came to\nour ears. That was all. Then quiet again, though the gamins had startled\nand listened, like young deer, at the sound. The doorways to all the\nbuildings were closed; the shutters to the shops were up. But there\nwere many police and watchmen in evidence, and now and again automobile\npatrols of the Mercenaries slipped swiftly past.\n\nHartman and I agreed that it was useless to report ourselves to the\nlocal chiefs of the secret service. Our failure so to report would be\nexcused, we knew, in the light of subsequent events. So we headed for\nthe great labor-ghetto on the South Side in the hope of getting in\ncontact with some of the comrades. Too late! We knew it. But we could\nnot stand still and do nothing in those ghastly, silent streets. Where\nwas Ernest? I was wondering. What was happening in the cities of the\nlabor castes and Mercenaries? In the fortresses?\n\nAs if in answer, a great screaming roar went up, dim with distance,\npunctuated with detonation after detonation.\n\n\"It's the fortresses,\" Hartman said. \"God pity those three regiments!\"\n\nAt a crossing we noticed, in the direction of the stockyards, a gigantic\npillar of smoke. At the next crossing several similar smoke pillars were\nrising skyward in the direction of the West Side. Over the city of the\nMercenaries we saw a great captive war-balloon that burst even as we\nlooked at it, and fell in flaming wreckage toward the earth. There was\nno clew to that tragedy of the air. We could not determine whether the\nballoon had been manned by comrades or enemies. A vague sound came to\nour ears, like the bubbling of a gigantic caldron a long way off, and\nHartman said it was machine-guns and automatic rifles.\n\nAnd still we walked in immediate quietude. Nothing was happening where\nwe were. The police and the automobile patrols went by, and once half\na dozen fire-engines, returning evidently from some conflagration. A\nquestion was called to the fireman by an officer in an automobile, and\nwe heard one shout in reply: \"No water! They've blown up the mains!\"\n\n\"We've smashed the water supply,\" Hartman cried excitedly to me. \"If we\ncan do all this in a premature, isolated, abortive attempt, what can't\nwe do in a concerted, ripened effort all over the land?\"\n\nThe automobile containing the officer who had asked the question darted\non. Suddenly there was a deafening roar. The machine, with its human\nfreight, lifted in an upburst of smoke, and sank down a mass of wreckage\nand death.\n\nHartman was jubilant. \"Well done! well done!\" he was repeating, over\nand over, in a whisper. \"The proletariat gets its lesson to-day, but it\ngives one, too.\"\n\nPolice were running for the spot. Also, another patrol machine had\nhalted. As for myself, I was in a daze. The suddenness of it was\nstunning. How had it happened? I knew not how, and yet I had been\nlooking directly at it. So dazed was I for the moment that I was\nscarcely aware of the fact that we were being held up by the police. I\nabruptly saw that a policeman was in the act of shooting Hartman. But\nHartman was cool and was giving the proper passwords. I saw the levelled\nrevolver hesitate, then sink down, and heard the disgusted grunt of the\npoliceman. He was very angry, and was cursing the whole secret service.\nIt was always in the way, he was averring, while Hartman was talking\nback to him and with fitting secret-service pride explaining to him the\nclumsiness of the police.\n\nThe next moment I knew how it had happened. There was quite a group\nabout the wreck, and two men were just lifting up the wounded officer\nto carry him to the other machine. A panic seized all of them, and\nthey scattered in every direction, running in blind terror, the wounded\nofficer, roughly dropped, being left behind. The cursing policeman\nalongside of me also ran, and Hartman and I ran, too, we knew not why,\nobsessed with the same blind terror to get away from that particular\nspot.\n\nNothing really happened then, but everything was explained. The flying\nmen were sheepishly coming back, but all the while their eyes were\nraised apprehensively to the many-windowed, lofty buildings that towered\nlike the sheer walls of a canyon on each side of the street. From one\nof those countless windows the bomb had been thrown, but which window?\nThere had been no second bomb, only a fear of one.\n\nThereafter we looked with speculative comprehension at the windows.\nAny of them contained possible death. Each building was a possible\nambuscade. This was warfare in that modern jungle, a great city. Every\nstreet was a canyon, every building a mountain. We had not changed much\nfrom primitive man, despite the war automobiles that were sliding by.\n\nTurning a corner, we came upon a woman. She was lying on the pavement,\nin a pool of blood. Hartman bent over and examined her. As for myself,\nI turned deathly sick. I was to see many dead that day, but the total\ncarnage was not to affect me as did this first forlorn body lying\nthere at my feet abandoned on the pavement. \"Shot in the breast,\" was\nHartman's report. Clasped in the hollow of her arm, as a child might be\nclasped, was a bundle of printed matter. Even in death she seemed loath\nto part with that which had caused her death; for when Hartman had\nsucceeded in withdrawing the bundle, we found that it consisted of large\nprinted sheets, the proclamations of the revolutionists.\n\n\"A comrade,\" I said.\n\nBut Hartman only cursed the Iron Heel, and we passed on. Often we\nwere halted by the police and patrols, but our passwords enabled us\nto proceed. No more bombs fell from the windows, the last pedestrians\nseemed to have vanished from the streets, and our immediate quietude\ngrew more profound; though the gigantic caldron continued to bubble in\nthe distance, dull roars of explosions came to us from all directions,\nand the smoke-pillars were towering more ominously in the heavens.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS\n\n\nSuddenly a change came over the face of things. A tingle of excitement\nran along the air. Automobiles fled past, two, three, a dozen, and from\nthem warnings were shouted to us. One of the machines swerved wildly\nat high speed half a block down, and the next moment, already left well\nbehind it, the pavement was torn into a great hole by a bursting bomb.\nWe saw the police disappearing down the cross-streets on the run, and\nknew that something terrible was coming. We could hear the rising roar\nof it.\n\n\"Our brave comrades are coming,\" Hartman said.\n\nWe could see the front of their column filling the street from gutter to\ngutter, as the last war-automobile fled past. The machine stopped for a\nmoment just abreast of us. A soldier leaped from it, carrying something\ncarefully in his hands. This, with the same care, he deposited in the\ngutter. Then he leaped back to his seat and the machine dashed on, took\nthe turn at the corner, and was gone from sight. Hartman ran to the\ngutter and stooped over the object.\n\n\"Keep back,\" he warned me.\n\nI could see he was working rapidly with his hands. When he returned to\nme the sweat was heavy on his forehead.\n\n\"I disconnected it,\" he said, \"and just in the nick of time. The soldier\nwas clumsy. He intended it for our comrades, but he didn't give it\nenough time. It would have exploded prematurely. Now it won't explode at\nall.\"\n\nEverything was happening rapidly now. Across the street and half a block\ndown, high up in a building, I could see heads peering out. I had just\npointed them out to Hartman, when a sheet of flame and smoke ran along\nthat portion of the face of the building where the heads had appeared,\nand the air was shaken by the explosion. In places the stone facing of\nthe building was torn away, exposing the iron construction beneath. The\nnext moment similar sheets of flame and smoke smote the front of the\nbuilding across the street opposite it. Between the explosions we could\nhear the rattle of the automatic pistols and rifles. For several minutes\nthis mid-air battle continued, then died out. It was patent that our\ncomrades were in one building, that Mercenaries were in the other, and\nthat they were fighting across the street. But we could not tell\nwhich was which--which building contained our comrades and which the\nMercenaries.\n\nBy this time the column on the street was almost on us. As the front of\nit passed under the warring buildings, both went into action again--one\nbuilding dropping bombs into the street, being attacked from across the\nstreet, and in return replying to that attack. Thus we learned which\nbuilding was held by our comrades, and they did good work, saving those\nin the street from the bombs of the enemy.\n\nHartman gripped my arm and dragged me into a wide entrance.\n\n\"They're not our comrades,\" he shouted in my ear.\n\nThe inner doors to the entrance were locked and bolted. We could not\nescape. The next moment the front of the column went by. It was not a\ncolumn, but a mob, an awful river that filled the street, the people\nof the abyss, mad with drink and wrong, up at last and roaring for the\nblood of their masters. I had seen the people of the abyss before, gone\nthrough its ghettos, and thought I knew it; but I found that I was now\nlooking on it for the first time. Dumb apathy had vanished. It was now\ndynamic--a fascinating spectacle of dread. It surged past my vision in\nconcrete waves of wrath, snarling and growling, carnivorous, drunk with\nwhiskey from pillaged warehouses, drunk with hatred, drunk with lust\nfor blood--men, women, and children, in rags and tatters, dim ferocious\nintelligences with all the godlike blotted from their features and all\nthe fiendlike stamped in, apes and tigers, anaemic consumptives and\ngreat hairy beasts of burden, wan faces from which vampire society had\nsucked the juice of life, bloated forms swollen with physical grossness\nand corruption, withered hags and death's-heads bearded like patriarchs,\nfestering youth and festering age, faces of fiends, crooked, twisted,\nmisshapen monsters blasted with the ravages of disease and all the\nhorrors of chronic innutrition--the refuse and the scum of life, a\nraging, screaming, screeching, demoniacal horde.\n\nAnd why not? The people of the abyss had nothing to lose but the misery\nand pain of living. And to gain?--nothing, save one final, awful glut of\nvengeance. And as I looked the thought came to me that in that rushing\nstream of human lava were men, comrades and heroes, whose mission had\nbeen to rouse the abysmal beast and to keep the enemy occupied in coping\nwith it.\n\nAnd now a strange thing happened to me. A transformation came over me.\nThe fear of death, for myself and for others, left me. I was strangely\nexalted, another being in another life. Nothing mattered. The Cause for\nthis one time was lost, but the Cause would be here to-morrow, the\nsame Cause, ever fresh and ever burning. And thereafter, in the orgy\nof horror that raged through the succeeding hours, I was able to take\na calm interest. Death meant nothing, life meant nothing. I was an\ninterested spectator of events, and, sometimes swept on by the rush,\nwas myself a curious participant. For my mind had leaped to a star-cool\naltitude and grasped a passionless transvaluation of values. Had it not\ndone this, I know that I should have died.\n\nHalf a mile of the mob had swept by when we were discovered. A woman\nin fantastic rags, with cheeks cavernously hollow and with narrow black\neyes like burning gimlets, caught a glimpse of Hartman and me. She\nlet out a shrill shriek and bore in upon us. A section of the mob tore\nitself loose and surged in after her. I can see her now, as I write\nthese lines, a leap in advance, her gray hair flying in thin tangled\nstrings, the blood dripping down her forehead from some wound in the\nscalp, in her right hand a hatchet, her left hand, lean and wrinkled, a\nyellow talon, gripping the air convulsively. Hartman sprang in front of\nme. This was no time for explanations. We were well dressed, and that\nwas enough. His fist shot out, striking the woman between her burning\neyes. The impact of the blow drove her backward, but she struck the wall\nof her on-coming fellows and bounced forward again, dazed and helpless,\nthe brandished hatchet falling feebly on Hartman's shoulder.\n\nThe next moment I knew not what was happening. I was overborne by the\ncrowd. The confined space was filled with shrieks and yells and curses.\nBlows were falling on me. Hands were ripping and tearing at my flesh\nand garments. I felt that I was being torn to pieces. I was being borne\ndown, suffocated. Some strong hand gripped my shoulder in the thick of\nthe press and was dragging fiercely at me. Between pain and pressure I\nfainted. Hartman never came out of that entrance. He had shielded me and\nreceived the first brunt of the attack. This had saved me, for the jam\nhad quickly become too dense for anything more than the mad gripping and\ntearing of hands.\n\nI came to in the midst of wild movement. All about me was the same\nmovement. I had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was sweeping me\nI knew not whither. Fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in my\nlungs. Faint and dizzy, I was vaguely aware of a strong arm around my\nbody under the arms, and half-lifting me and dragging me along. Feebly\nmy own limbs were helping me. In front of me I could see the moving back\nof a man's coat. It had been slit from top to bottom along the centre\nseam, and it pulsed rhythmically, the slit opening and closing regularly\nwith every leap of the wearer. This phenomenon fascinated me for a time,\nwhile my senses were coming back to me. Next I became aware of stinging\ncheeks and nose, and could feel blood dripping on my face. My hat was\ngone. My hair was down and flying, and from the stinging of the scalp I\nmanaged to recollect a hand in the press of the entrance that had torn\nat my hair. My chest and arms were bruised and aching in a score of\nplaces.\n\nMy brain grew clearer, and I turned as I ran and looked at the man who\nwas holding me up. He it was who had dragged me out and saved me. He\nnoticed my movement.\n\n\"It's all right!\" he shouted hoarsely. \"I knew you on the instant.\"\n\nI failed to recognize him, but before I could speak I trod upon\nsomething that was alive and that squirmed under my foot. I was swept on\nby those behind and could not look down and see, and yet I knew that it\nwas a woman who had fallen and who was being trampled into the pavement\nby thousands of successive feet.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he repeated. \"I'm Garthwaite.\"\n\nHe was bearded and gaunt and dirty, but I succeeded in remembering him\nas the stalwart youth that had spent several months in our Glen Ellen\nrefuge three years before. He passed me the signals of the Iron Heel's\nsecret service, in token that he, too, was in its employ.\n\n\"I'll get you out of this as soon as I can get a chance,\" he assured me.\n\"But watch your footing. On your life don't stumble and go down.\"\n\nAll things happened abruptly on that day, and with an abruptness that\nwas sickening the mob checked itself. I came in violent collision with\na large woman in front of me (the man with the split coat had vanished),\nwhile those behind collided against me. A devilish pandemonium\nreigned,--shrieks, curses, and cries of death, while above all rose the\nchurning rattle of machine-guns and the put-a-put, put-a-put of rifles.\nAt first I could make out nothing. People were falling about me right\nand left. The woman in front doubled up and went down, her hands on her\nabdomen in a frenzied clutch. A man was quivering against my legs in a\ndeath-struggle.\n\nIt came to me that we were at the head of the column. Half a mile of it\nhad disappeared--where or how I never learned. To this day I do not know\nwhat became of that half-mile of humanity--whether it was blotted out\nby some frightful bolt of war, whether it was scattered and destroyed\npiecemeal, or whether it escaped. But there we were, at the head of the\ncolumn instead of in its middle, and we were being swept out of life by\na torrent of shrieking lead.\n\nAs soon as death had thinned the jam, Garthwaite, still grasping my arm,\nled a rush of survivors into the wide entrance of an office building.\nHere, at the rear, against the doors, we were pressed by a panting,\ngasping mass of creatures. For some time we remained in this position\nwithout a change in the situation.\n\n\"I did it beautifully,\" Garthwaite was lamenting to me. \"Ran you right\ninto a trap. We had a gambler's chance in the street, but in here\nthere is no chance at all. It's all over but the shouting. Vive la\nRevolution!\"\n\nThen, what he expected, began. The Mercenaries were killing without\nquarter. At first, the surge back upon us was crushing, but as the\nkilling continued the pressure was eased. The dead and dying went down\nand made room. Garthwaite put his mouth to my ear and shouted, but in\nthe frightful din I could not catch what he said. He did not wait. He\nseized me and threw me down. Next he dragged a dying woman over on top\nof me, and, with much squeezing and shoving, crawled in beside me and\npartly over me. A mound of dead and dying began to pile up over us, and\nover this mound, pawing and moaning, crept those that still survived.\nBut these, too, soon ceased, and a semi-silence settled down, broken by\ngroans and sobs and sounds of strangulation.\n\nI should have been crushed had it not been for Garthwaite. As it was,\nit seemed inconceivable that I could bear the weight I did and live. And\nyet, outside of pain, the only feeling I possessed was one of curiosity.\nHow was it going to end? What would death be like? Thus did I receive\nmy red baptism in that Chicago shambles. Prior to that, death to me had\nbeen a theory; but ever afterward death has been a simple fact that does\nnot matter, it is so easy.\n\nBut the Mercenaries were not content with what they had done. They\ninvaded the entrance, killing the wounded and searching out the unhurt\nthat, like ourselves, were playing dead. I remember one man they dragged\nout of a heap, who pleaded abjectly until a revolver shot cut him short.\nThen there was a woman who charged from a heap, snarling and shooting.\nShe fired six shots before they got her, though what damage she did we\ncould not know. We could follow these tragedies only by the sound. Every\nlittle while flurries like this occurred, each flurry culminating in the\nrevolver shot that put an end to it. In the intervals we could hear\nthe soldiers talking and swearing as they rummaged among the carcasses,\nurged on by their officers to hurry up.\n\nAt last they went to work on our heap, and we could feel the pressure\ndiminish as they dragged away the dead and wounded. Garthwaite began\nuttering aloud the signals. At first he was not heard. Then he raised\nhis voice.\n\n\"Listen to that,\" we heard a soldier say. And next the sharp voice of an\nofficer. \"Hold on there! Careful as you go!\"\n\nOh, that first breath of air as we were dragged out! Garthwaite did the\ntalking at first, but I was compelled to undergo a brief examination to\nprove service with the Iron Heel.\n\n\"Agents-provocateurs all right,\" was the officer's conclusion. He was\na beardless young fellow, a cadet, evidently, of some great oligarch\nfamily.\n\n\"It's a hell of a job,\" Garthwaite grumbled. \"I'm going to try and\nresign and get into the army. You fellows have a snap.\"\n\n\"You've earned it,\" was the young officer's answer. \"I've got some pull,\nand I'll see if it can be managed. I can tell them how I found you.\"\n\nHe took Garthwaite's name and number, then turned to me.\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm going to be married,\" I answered lightly, \"and then I'll be out\nof it all.\"\n\nAnd so we talked, while the killing of the wounded went on. It is all\na dream, now, as I look back on it; but at the time it was the most\nnatural thing in the world. Garthwaite and the young officer fell into\nan animated conversation over the difference between so-called modern\nwarfare and the present street-fighting and sky-scraper fighting that\nwas taking place all over the city. I followed them intently, fixing up\nmy hair at the same time and pinning together my torn skirts. And all\nthe time the killing of the wounded went on. Sometimes the revolver\nshots drowned the voices of Garthwaite and the officer, and they were\ncompelled to repeat what they had been saying.\n\nI lived through three days of the Chicago Commune, and the vastness of\nit and of the slaughter may be imagined when I say that in all that time\nI saw practically nothing outside the killing of the people of the abyss\nand the mid-air fighting between sky-scrapers. I really saw nothing of\nthe heroic work done by the comrades. I could hear the explosions of\ntheir mines and bombs, and see the smoke of their conflagrations, and\nthat was all. The mid-air part of one great deed I saw, however, and\nthat was the balloon attacks made by our comrades on the fortresses.\nThat was on the second day. The three disloyal regiments had been\ndestroyed in the fortresses to the last man. The fortresses were crowded\nwith Mercenaries, the wind blew in the right direction, and up went our\nballoons from one of the office buildings in the city.\n\nNow Biedenbach, after he left Glen Ellen, had invented a most powerful\nexplosive--\"expedite\" he called it. This was the weapon the balloons\nused. They were only hot-air balloons, clumsily and hastily made, but\nthey did the work. I saw it all from the top of an office building. The\nfirst balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the\ncountry; but we learned about it afterward. Burton and O'Sullivan were\nin it. As they were descending they swept across a railroad directly\nover a troop-train that was heading at full speed for Chicago. They\ndropped their whole supply of expedite upon the locomotive. The\nresulting wreck tied the line up for days. And the best of it was that,\nreleased from the weight of expedite, the balloon shot up into the\nair and did not come down for half a dozen miles, both heroes escaping\nunharmed.\n\nThe second balloon was a failure. Its flight was lame. It floated too\nlow and was shot full of holes before it could reach the fortresses.\nHerford and Guinness were in it, and they were blown to pieces along\nwith the field into which they fell. Biedenbach was in despair--we heard\nall about it afterward--and he went up alone in the third balloon. He,\ntoo, made a low flight, but he was in luck, for they failed seriously to\npuncture his balloon. I can see it now as I did then, from the lofty top\nof the building--that inflated bag drifting along the air, and that tiny\nspeck of a man clinging on beneath. I could not see the fortress, but\nthose on the roof with me said he was directly over it. I did not\nsee the expedite fall when he cut it loose. But I did see the balloon\nsuddenly leap up into the sky. An appreciable time after that the great\ncolumn of the explosion towered in the air, and after that, in turn, I\nheard the roar of it. Biedenbach the gentle had destroyed a fortress.\nTwo other balloons followed at the same time. One was blown to pieces\nin the air, the expedite exploding, and the shock of it disrupted the\nsecond balloon, which fell prettily into the remaining fortress.\nIt couldn't have been better planned, though the two comrades in it\nsacrificed their lives.\n\nBut to return to the people of the abyss. My experiences were confined\nto them. They raged and slaughtered and destroyed all over the city\nproper, and were in turn destroyed; but never once did they succeed in\nreaching the city of the oligarchs over on the west side. The oligarchs\nhad protected themselves well. No matter what destruction was wreaked in\nthe heart of the city, they, and their womenkind and children, were to\nescape hurt. I am told that their children played in the parks during\nthose terrible days and that their favorite game was an imitation of\ntheir elders stamping upon the proletariat.\n\nBut the Mercenaries found it no easy task to cope with the people of the\nabyss and at the same time fight with the comrades. Chicago was true to\nher traditions, and though a generation of revolutionists was wiped out,\nit took along with it pretty close to a generation of its enemies.\nOf course, the Iron Heel kept the figures secret, but, at a very\nconservative estimate, at least one hundred and thirty thousand\nMercenaries were slain. But the comrades had no chance. Instead of the\nwhole country being hand in hand in revolt, they were all alone, and the\ntotal strength of the Oligarchy could have been directed against them\nif necessary. As it was, hour after hour, day after day, in endless\ntrain-loads, by hundreds of thousands, the Mercenaries were hurled into\nChicago.\n\nAnd there were so many of the people of the abyss! Tiring of the\nslaughter, a great herding movement was begun by the soldiers, the\nintent of which was to drive the street mobs, like cattle, into Lake\nMichigan. It was at the beginning of this movement that Garthwaite and I\nhad encountered the young officer. This herding movement was practically\na failure, thanks to the splendid work of the comrades. Instead of the\ngreat host the Mercenaries had hoped to gather together, they succeeded\nin driving no more than forty thousand of the wretches into the lake.\nTime and again, when a mob of them was well in hand and being driven\nalong the streets to the water, the comrades would create a diversion,\nand the mob would escape through the consequent hole torn in the\nencircling net.\n\nGarthwaite and I saw an example of this shortly after meeting with the\nyoung officer. The mob of which we had been a part, and which had been\nput in retreat, was prevented from escaping to the south and east by\nstrong bodies of troops. The troops we had fallen in with had held it\nback on the west. The only outlet was north, and north it went toward\nthe lake, driven on from east and west and south by machine-gun fire and\nautomatics. Whether it divined that it was being driven toward the lake,\nor whether it was merely a blind squirm of the monster, I do not know;\nbut at any rate the mob took a cross street to the west, turned down\nthe next street, and came back upon its track, heading south toward the\ngreat ghetto.\n\nGarthwaite and I at that time were trying to make our way westward to\nget out of the territory of street-fighting, and we were caught right in\nthe thick of it again. As we came to the corner we saw the howling mob\nbearing down upon us. Garthwaite seized my arm and we were just starting\nto run, when he dragged me back from in front of the wheels of half a\ndozen war automobiles, equipped with machine-guns, that were rushing for\nthe spot. Behind them came the soldiers with their automatic rifles.\nBy the time they took position, the mob was upon them, and it looked as\nthough they would be overwhelmed before they could get into action.\n\nHere and there a soldier was discharging his rifle, but this scattered\nfire had no effect in checking the mob. On it came, bellowing with brute\nrage. It seemed the machine-guns could not get started. The automobiles\non which they were mounted blocked the street, compelling the soldiers\nto find positions in, between, and on the sidewalks. More and more\nsoldiers were arriving, and in the jam we were unable to get away.\nGarthwaite held me by the arm, and we pressed close against the front of\na building.\n\nThe mob was no more than twenty-five feet away when the machine-guns\nopened up; but before that flaming sheet of death nothing could live.\nThe mob came on, but it could not advance. It piled up in a heap, a\nmound, a huge and growing wave of dead and dying. Those behind urged on,\nand the column, from gutter to gutter, telescoped upon itself. Wounded\ncreatures, men and women, were vomited over the top of that awful wave\nand fell squirming down the face of it till they threshed about under\nthe automobiles and against the legs of the soldiers. The latter\nbayoneted the struggling wretches, though one I saw who gained his feet\nand flew at a soldier's throat with his teeth. Together they went down,\nsoldier and slave, into the welter.\n\nThe firing ceased. The work was done. The mob had been stopped in its\nwild attempt to break through. Orders were being given to clear the\nwheels of the war-machines. They could not advance over that wave of\ndead, and the idea was to run them down the cross street. The soldiers\nwere dragging the bodies away from the wheels when it happened. We\nlearned afterward how it happened. A block distant a hundred of our\ncomrades had been holding a building. Across roofs and through buildings\nthey made their way, till they found themselves looking down upon the\nclose-packed soldiers. Then it was counter-massacre.\n\nWithout warning, a shower of bombs fell from the top of the building.\nThe automobiles were blown to fragments, along with many soldiers. We,\nwith the survivors, swept back in mad retreat. Half a block down another\nbuilding opened fire on us. As the soldiers had carpeted the street with\ndead slaves, so, in turn, did they themselves become carpet. Garthwaite\nand I bore charmed lives. As we had done before, so again we sought\nshelter in an entrance. But he was not to be caught napping this time.\nAs the roar of the bombs died away, he began peering out.\n\n\"The mob's coming back!\" he called to me. \"We've got to get out of\nthis!\"\n\nWe fled, hand in hand, down the bloody pavement, slipping and sliding,\nand making for the corner. Down the cross street we could see a few\nsoldiers still running. Nothing was happening to them. The way was\nclear. So we paused a moment and looked back. The mob came on slowly.\nIt was busy arming itself with the rifles of the slain and killing the\nwounded. We saw the end of the young officer who had rescued us.\nHe painfully lifted himself on his elbow and turned loose with his\nautomatic pistol.\n\n\"There goes my chance of promotion,\" Garthwaite laughed, as a woman bore\ndown on the wounded man, brandishing a butcher's cleaver. \"Come on. It's\nthe wrong direction, but we'll get out somehow.\"\n\nAnd we fled eastward through the quiet streets, prepared at every cross\nstreet for anything to happen. To the south a monster conflagration was\nfilling the sky, and we knew that the great ghetto was burning. At last\nI sank down on the sidewalk. I was exhausted and could go no farther.\nI was bruised and sore and aching in every limb; yet I could not escape\nsmiling at Garthwaite, who was rolling a cigarette and saying:\n\n\"I know I'm making a mess of rescuing you, but I can't get head nor\ntail of the situation. It's all a mess. Every time we try to break out,\nsomething happens and we're turned back. We're only a couple of blocks\nnow from where I got you out of that entrance. Friend and foe are all\nmixed up. It's chaos. You can't tell who is in those darned buildings.\nTry to find out, and you get a bomb on your head. Try to go peaceably on\nyour way, and you run into a mob and are killed by machine-guns, or\nyou run into the Mercenaries and are killed by your own comrades from a\nroof. And on the top of it all the mob comes along and kills you, too.\"\n\nHe shook his head dolefully, lighted his cigarette, and sat down beside\nme.\n\n\"And I'm that hungry,\" he added, \"I could eat cobblestones.\"\n\nThe next moment he was on his feet again and out in the street prying up\na cobblestone. He came back with it and assaulted the window of a store\nbehind us.\n\n\"It's ground floor and no good,\" he explained as he helped me through\nthe hole he had made; \"but it's the best we can do. You get a nap and\nI'll reconnoitre. I'll finish this rescue all right, but I want time,\ntime, lots of it--and something to eat.\"\n\nIt was a harness store we found ourselves in, and he fixed me up a couch\nof horse blankets in the private office well to the rear. To add to my\nwretchedness a splitting headache was coming on, and I was only too glad\nto close my eyes and try to sleep.\n\n\"I'll be back,\" were his parting words. \"I don't hope to get an auto,\nbut I'll surely bring some grub,* anyway.\"\n\n     * Food.\n\nAnd that was the last I saw of Garthwaite for three years. Instead of\ncoming back, he was carried away to a hospital with a bullet through his\nlungs and another through the fleshy part of his neck.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nNIGHTMARE\n\n\nI had not closed my eyes the night before on the Twentieth Century, and\nwhat of that and of my exhaustion I slept soundly. When I first awoke,\nit was night. Garthwaite had not returned. I had lost my watch and had\nno idea of the time. As I lay with my eyes closed, I heard the same\ndull sound of distant explosions. The inferno was still raging. I crept\nthrough the store to the front. The reflection from the sky of vast\nconflagrations made the street almost as light as day. One could have\nread the finest print with ease. From several blocks away came the\ncrackle of small hand-bombs and the churning of machine-guns, and from a\nlong way off came a long series of heavy explosions. I crept back to my\nhorse blankets and slept again.\n\nWhen next I awoke, a sickly yellow light was filtering in on me. It was\ndawn of the second day. I crept to the front of the store. A smoke pall,\nshot through with lurid gleams, filled the sky. Down the opposite\nside of the street tottered a wretched slave. One hand he held tightly\nagainst his side, and behind him he left a bloody trail. His eyes roved\neverywhere, and they were filled with apprehension and dread. Once he\nlooked straight across at me, and in his face was all the dumb pathos\nof the wounded and hunted animal. He saw me, but there was no kinship\nbetween us, and with him, at least, no sympathy of understanding; for\nhe cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on. He could expect no aid\nin all God's world. He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the\nmasters were making. All he could hope for, all he sought, was some hole\nto crawl away in and hide like any animal. The sharp clang of a passing\nambulance at the corner gave him a start. Ambulances were not for such\nas he. With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway. A minute\nlater he was out again and desperately hobbling on.\n\nI went back to my horse blankets and waited an hour for Garthwaite. My\nheadache had not gone away. On the contrary, it was increasing. It was\nby an effort of will only that I was able to open my eyes and look\nat objects. And with the opening of my eyes and the looking came\nintolerable torment. Also, a great pulse was beating in my brain. Weak\nand reeling, I went out through the broken window and down the street,\nseeking to escape, instinctively and gropingly, from the awful shambles.\nAnd thereafter I lived nightmare. My memory of what happened in the\nsucceeding hours is the memory one would have of nightmare. Many events\nare focussed sharply on my brain, but between these indelible pictures\nI retain are intervals of unconsciousness. What occurred in those\nintervals I know not, and never shall know.\n\nI remember stumbling at the corner over the legs of a man. It was the\npoor hunted wretch that had dragged himself past my hiding-place. How\ndistinctly do I remember his poor, pitiful, gnarled hands as he lay\nthere on the pavement--hands that were more hoof and claw than hands,\nall twisted and distorted by the toil of all his days, with on the palms\na horny growth of callous a half inch thick. And as I picked myself\nup and started on, I looked into the face of the thing and saw that it\nstill lived; for the eyes, dimly intelligent, were looking at me and\nseeing me.\n\nAfter that came a kindly blank. I knew nothing, saw nothing, merely\ntottered on in my quest for safety. My next nightmare vision was a\nquiet street of the dead. I came upon it abruptly, as a wanderer in the\ncountry would come upon a flowing stream. Only this stream I gazed upon\ndid not flow. It was congealed in death. From pavement to pavement, and\ncovering the sidewalks, it lay there, spread out quite evenly, with\nonly here and there a lump or mound of bodies to break the surface. Poor\ndriven people of the abyss, hunted helots--they lay there as the rabbits\nin California after a drive.* Up the street and down I looked. There was\nno movement, no sound. The quiet buildings looked down upon the scene\nfrom their many windows. And once, and once only, I saw an arm that\nmoved in that dead stream. I swear I saw it move, with a strange\nwrithing gesture of agony, and with it lifted a head, gory with nameless\nhorror, that gibbered at me and then lay down again and moved no more.\n\n     * In those days, so sparsely populated was the land that\n     wild animals often became pests.  In California the custom\n     of rabbit-driving obtained.  On a given day all the farmers\n     in a locality would assemble and sweep across the country in\n     converging lines, driving the rabbits by scores of thousands\n     into a prepared enclosure, where they were clubbed to death\n     by men and boys.\n\nI remember another street, with quiet buildings on either side, and the\npanic that smote me into consciousness as again I saw the people of the\nabyss, but this time in a stream that flowed and came on. And then I saw\nthere was nothing to fear. The stream moved slowly, while from it arose\ngroans and lamentations, cursings, babblings of senility, hysteria, and\ninsanity; for these were the very young and the very old, the feeble and\nthe sick, the helpless and the hopeless, all the wreckage of the ghetto.\nThe burning of the great ghetto on the South Side had driven them forth\ninto the inferno of the street-fighting, and whither they wended and\nwhatever became of them I did not know and never learned.*\n\n     * It was long a question of debate, whether the burning of\n     the South Side ghetto was accidental, or whether it was done\n     by the Mercenaries; but it is definitely settled now that\n     the ghetto was fired by the Mercenaries under orders from\n     their chiefs.\n\nI have faint memories of breaking a window and hiding in some shop to\nescape a street mob that was pursued by soldiers. Also, a bomb burst\nnear me, once, in some still street, where, look as I would, up and\ndown, I could see no human being. But my next sharp recollection begins\nwith the crack of a rifle and an abrupt becoming aware that I am being\nfired at by a soldier in an automobile. The shot missed, and the next\nmoment I was screaming and motioning the signals. My memory of riding in\nthe automobile is very hazy, though this ride, in turn, is broken by one\nvivid picture. The crack of the rifle of the soldier sitting beside me\nmade me open my eyes, and I saw George Milford, whom I had known in the\nPell Street days, sinking slowly down to the sidewalk. Even as he sank\nthe soldier fired again, and Milford doubled in, then flung his body\nout, and fell sprawling. The soldier chuckled, and the automobile sped\non.\n\nThe next I knew after that I was awakened out of a sound sleep by a man\nwho walked up and down close beside me. His face was drawn and strained,\nand the sweat rolled down his nose from his forehead. One hand was\nclutched tightly against his chest by the other hand, and blood\ndripped down upon the floor as he walked. He wore the uniform of the\nMercenaries. From without, as through thick walls, came the muffled roar\nof bursting bombs. I was in some building that was locked in combat with\nsome other building.\n\nA surgeon came in to dress the wounded soldier, and I learned that it\nwas two in the afternoon. My headache was no better, and the surgeon\npaused from his work long enough to give me a powerful drug that would\ndepress the heart and bring relief. I slept again, and the next I knew I\nwas on top of the building. The immediate fighting had ceased, and I\nwas watching the balloon attack on the fortresses. Some one had an arm\naround me and I was leaning close against him. It came to me quite as a\nmatter of course that this was Ernest, and I found myself wondering how\nhe had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed.\n\nIt was by the merest chance that we had found each other in that\nterrible city. He had had no idea that I had left New York, and, coming\nthrough the room where I lay asleep, could not at first believe that\nit was I. Little more I saw of the Chicago Commune. After watching the\nballoon attack, Ernest took me down into the heart of the building,\nwhere I slept the afternoon out and the night. The third day we spent\nin the building, and on the fourth, Ernest having got permission and an\nautomobile from the authorities, we left Chicago.\n\nMy headache was gone, but, body and soul, I was very tired. I lay back\nagainst Ernest in the automobile, and with apathetic eyes watched the\nsoldiers trying to get the machine out of the city. Fighting was\nstill going on, but only in isolated localities. Here and there whole\ndistricts were still in possession of the comrades, but such districts\nwere surrounded and guarded by heavy bodies of troops. In a hundred\nsegregated traps were the comrades thus held while the work of\nsubjugating them went on. Subjugation meant death, for no quarter was\ngiven, and they fought heroically to the last man.*\n\n     * Numbers of the buildings held out over a week, while one\n     held out eleven days.  Each building had to be stormed like\n     a fort, and the Mercenaries fought their way upward floor by\n     floor.  It was deadly fighting.  Quarter was neither given\n     nor taken, and in the fighting the revolutionists had the\n     advantage of being above.  While the revolutionists were\n     wiped out, the loss was not one-sided.  The proud Chicago\n     proletariat lived up to its ancient boast.  For as many of\n     itself as were killed, it killed that many of the enemy.\n\nWhenever we approached such localities, the guards turned us back and\nsent us around. Once, the only way past two strong positions of the\ncomrades was through a burnt section that lay between. From either side\nwe could hear the rattle and roar of war, while the automobile picked\nits way through smoking ruins and tottering walls. Often the streets\nwere blocked by mountains of debris that compelled us to go around. We\nwere in a labyrinth of ruin, and our progress was slow.\n\nThe stockyards (ghetto, plant, and everything) were smouldering ruins.\nFar off to the right a wide smoke haze dimmed the sky,--the town of\nPullman, the soldier chauffeur told us, or what had been the town of\nPullman, for it was utterly destroyed. He had driven the machine out\nthere, with despatches, on the afternoon of the third day. Some of the\nheaviest fighting had occurred there, he said, many of the streets being\nrendered impassable by the heaps of the dead.\n\nSwinging around the shattered walls of a building, in the stockyards\ndistrict, the automobile was stopped by a wave of dead. It was for all\nthe world like a wave tossed up by the sea. It was patent to us what\nhad happened. As the mob charged past the corner, it had been swept, at\nright angles and point-blank range, by the machine-guns drawn up on the\ncross street. But disaster had come to the soldiers. A chance bomb must\nhave exploded among them, for the mob, checked until its dead and dying\nformed the wave, had white-capped and flung forward its foam of living,\nfighting slaves. Soldiers and slaves lay together, torn and mangled,\naround and over the wreckage of the automobiles and guns.\n\nErnest sprang out. A familiar pair of shoulders in a cotton shirt and a\nfamiliar fringe of white hair had caught his eye. I did not watch him,\nand it was not until he was back beside me and we were speeding on that\nhe said:\n\n\"It was Bishop Morehouse.\"\n\nSoon we were in the green country, and I took one last glance back at\nthe smoke-filled sky. Faint and far came the low thud of an explosion.\nThen I turned my face against Ernest's breast and wept softly for the\nCause that was lost. Ernest's arm about me was eloquent with love.\n\n\"For this time lost, dear heart,\" he said, \"but not forever. We have\nlearned. To-morrow the Cause will rise again, strong with wisdom and\ndiscipline.\"\n\nThe automobile drew up at a railroad station. Here we would catch a\ntrain to New York. As we waited on the platform, three trains thundered\npast, bound west to Chicago. They were crowded with ragged, unskilled\nlaborers, people of the abyss.\n\n\"Slave-levies for the rebuilding of Chicago,\" Ernest said. \"You see, the\nChicago slaves are all killed.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE TERRORISTS\n\n\nIt was not until Ernest and I were back in New York, and after weeks had\nelapsed, that we were able to comprehend thoroughly the full sweep of\nthe disaster that had befallen the Cause. The situation was bitter and\nbloody. In many places, scattered over the country, slave revolts and\nmassacres had occurred. The roll of the martyrs increased mightily.\nCountless executions took place everywhere. The mountains and waste\nregions were filled with outlaws and refugees who were being hunted down\nmercilessly. Our own refuges were packed with comrades who had prices on\ntheir heads. Through information furnished by its spies, scores of our\nrefuges were raided by the soldiers of the Iron Heel.\n\nMany of the comrades were disheartened, and they retaliated with\nterroristic tactics. The set-back to their hopes made them despairing\nand desperate. Many terrorist organizations unaffiliated with us sprang\ninto existence and caused us much trouble.* These misguided people\nsacrificed their own lives wantonly, very often made our own plans go\nastray, and retarded our organization.\n\n     * The annals of this short-lived era of despair make bloody\n     reading.  Revenge was the ruling motive, and the members of\n     the terroristic organizations were careless of their own\n     lives and hopeless about the future.  The Danites, taking\n     their name from the avenging angels of the Mormon mythology,\n     sprang up in the mountains of the Great West and spread over\n     the Pacific Coast from Panama to Alaska.  The Valkyries were\n     women.  They were the most terrible of all.  No woman was\n     eligible for membership who had not lost near relatives at\n     the hands of the Oligarchy.  They were guilty of torturing\n     their prisoners to death.  Another famous organization of\n     women was The Widows of War.  A companion organization to\n     the Valkyries was the Berserkers.  These men placed no value\n     whatever upon their own lives, and it was they who totally\n     destroyed the great Mercenary city of Bellona along with its\n     population of over a hundred thousand souls.  The Bedlamites\n     and the Helldamites were twin slave organizations, while a\n     new religious sect that did not flourish long was called The\n     Wrath of God.  Among others, to show the whimsicality of\n     their deadly seriousness, may be mentioned the following:\n     The Bleeding Hearts, Sons of the Morning, the Morning Stars,\n     The Flamingoes, The Triple Triangles, The Three Bars, The\n     Rubonics, The Vindicators, The Comanches, and the\n     Erebusites.\n\nAnd through it all moved the Iron Heel, impassive and deliberate,\nshaking up the whole fabric of the social structure in its search for\nthe comrades, combing out the Mercenaries, the labor castes, and all its\nsecret services, punishing without mercy and without malice, suffering\nin silence all retaliations that were made upon it, and filling the gaps\nin its fighting line as fast as they appeared. And hand in hand with\nthis, Ernest and the other leaders were hard at work reorganizing the\nforces of the Revolution. The magnitude of the task may be understood\nwhen it is taken into.*\n\n     * This is the end of the Everhard Manuscript.  It breaks off\n     abruptly in the middle of a sentence.  She must have\n     received warning of the coming of the Mercenaries, for she\n     had time safely to hide the Manuscript before she fled or\n     was captured.  It is to be regretted that she did not live\n     to complete her narrative, for then, undoubtedly, would have\n     been cleared away the mystery that has shrouded for seven\n     centuries the execution of Ernest Everhard.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Iron Heel, by Jack London\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IRON HEEL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1164.txt or 1164.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/1\/6\/1164\/\n\nProduced by Donald Lainson\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":132,"split":"train"}
