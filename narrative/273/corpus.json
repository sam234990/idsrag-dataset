She notices that the rainbow is approaching her and Toto as both of them run towards it. Dorothy starts to see Glinda the Good Witch who tells Dorothy that she must return to Oz so that she can save Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion. Dorothy and Toto reclaim the silver shoes as they find a note from Glinda and Princess Ozma stating that the silver shoes can take her to the Land of Oz and back for the Impassable Desert has taken away much of their power.\nDorothy and Toto arrive in the Land of Oz where the items that Dorothy has in her pocket are a small mirror, a safety pin, a glass bottle, and four of Aunt Em's home-made oatmeal cookies. Dorothy and Toto were wondering which direction should they take when they encounter a molasses-covered owl named Wiser. Wiser tells Dorothy that she is in Gillikin Country and tells her to head to Candy County and ask the Great Royal Marshmallow that rules over Candy Country. Arriving at Princess Gayelette's palace, Dorothy and Toto encounter the castle's Jester who welcomes them. The Jester tells them that Princess Gayelette and Prince Quelala have gone missing, adding that they disappeared during a party at the palace which had become haunted and points them in the direction of the castle. When Dorothy and Toto enter the palace, they find a wand that belonged to the Wicked Witch of the West lying on the table.\nDorothy reminds the Jester that jesters are supposed to make people happy causing the Jester to freeze in his tracks as the Wicked Witch of the West's ghost urges the Jester to turn Dorothy into a china doll. The Jester gives up the wand as the Wicked Witch of the West's ghost fades away. Thus, the spell is broken and everyone is returned to normal. Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and Toto rejoice now that the spell is broken. When the Cowardly Lion asks Dorothy on what she plans to do with the Wicked Witch of the West's wand, Scarecrow and Tin Man plan to keep the wand locked up in a case until they can give it to Glinda and Princess Ozma.\nDorothy returns to Kansas where they reunited with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. The three of them then see a rainbow in the twilight sky which Dorothy hasn't seen before. Dorothy knows that is must be Princess Ozma, Glinda, and the Wizard of Oz's way of saying goodbye to her. The rainbow shimmered over the prairie with all the bright and true colors of the Land of Oz.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Dorothy, by Evelyn Raymond\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

There, upon the marble step, stood a wicker\nbaby-wagon with a baby in it; and, having received this peculiar\ngreeting, the baby screamed, too. Then it laughed, Mrs. Chester laughed,\nand, hearing both the screams and the laughter, postman John Chester\nhurriedly set down his cup of coffee and ran to the doorway. In another\ninstant he, also, was laughing. What childless, child-loving man could\nhelp doing so, beholding the pretty sight before him?\n\nFor Martha, his wife, had caught the little creature out of the wagon\nand was ecstatically hugging it, cooing to it, mothering it, as\nnaturally as if this little one she was tossing up and down were not\nalmost the first child she had ever so fondled.\n\n\"John! John! O John! _It's meant!_ It's for us! See, see? The little\ncard on its coat says: 'My name is Dorothy C. I have come to be your\ndaughter.' Our daughter, John Chester! Oh! what a blessed gift!\nWho--who--can have sent her?\"\n\nThen John Chester stopped laughing and, laying his hand on his wife's\nshoulder with a protesting pressure, said:\n\n\"There, little woman, don't go building hopes on such a thing as this.\nDoubtless, some of the neighbors have left the little one here for a\njoke. If the good Lord has sent us no babies of our own it's not likely\nHe'd put it into the hearts of others to give us theirs. It'll be called\nfor before I get in from my rounds. Well, good-bye. Wish I could stay\nand play with the kid, but I'm late already. Good-bye.\"\n\nAs he stooped to kiss her, after his accustomed fashion, his cap touched\nthe baby's cheek, pressed so close to Martha's, and with a frown and a\ntwist Miss Dorothy C. put up her tiny hand and knocked it from his head.\nThen she wrinkled her funny little nose, laughed again, and from that\ninstant the letter-carrier became her abject slave.\n\nAs he sped down the street, to take a car for the post-office and the\nmorning mail he must deliver, he saw old Mrs. Cecil's carriage drive\nslowly around the corner. She was not \"Mrs. Cecil\" exactly, for there\nwas more of her name upon her visiting cards: \"Mrs. Cecil Somerset\nCalvert,\" and she was one of the proudest of old Maryland dames. But she\nwas called by the shorter title by all sorts and conditions of people.\nShe was on John Chester's route and quite often addressed him as\n\"Johnnie,\" though Mrs. Martha resented this as being too familiar. In\nher own eyes John was the wisest and best man in the world, far too good\nto be called \"Johnnie\" like any schoolboy. The postman himself did not\nresent it. He resented very little that befell and simply trotted\nthrough life as he did over his mail-route, with a cheery word and smile\nfor everybody. Therefore, it was quite characteristic that he should\ngood-naturedly obey Mrs. Cecil's summons to come to her carriage, that\nshe had ordered stopped, even though he was just boarding a car and had\nno time to waste.\n\n\"Johnnie, what was that I saw in your wife's arms, as I drove by?\" she\ndemanded as he came up.\n\n\"A baby. The cutest ever was. Somebody's playing a joke on us, leaving\nit on our steps.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like that kind of a joke. Whose is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'll tell you more when I get round with the mail. Beg\npardon, please, there comes another car,\" he replied, still smiling,\nalthough he was edging away as fast as he dared, without giving offense\nto this quick-tempered old lady.\n\n\"Shall you be fool enough to take the youngster in, if nobody calls for\nit? What salary do you get?\" she continued, ignoring his evident\nreluctance to be further delayed.\n\nHe answered hastily, raised his cap, and managed to catch the next car,\nspringing up on the rear platform while it was already in motion and\nreckoning that he would have to run, instead of trot, if he made up time\nand got his morning letters to those who expected them along with their\nbreakfast.\n\nAs he disappeared Mrs. Cecil nodded her handsome white head a number of\ntimes, in satisfaction over something, and remarked to her poodle:\n\n\"Made no mistake. He's a straight man. Well, well, well! The idea of\nanybody being simpleton enough to be glad of the care of a squalling\nbaby!\"\n\nThen she drove home to her own fine house, which stood at the junction\nof the broad avenue and the narrow street. As old Ephraim turned his\nhorses into the spacious grounds a thrill of pride ran through his\nmistress's heart, while she shouted to her half-deaf coachman:\n\n\"Bellevieu never looked finer that it does this spring, boy.\"\n\nTo which the gray-headed \"boy\" echoed:\n\n\"Fine this spring, Miss Betty.\"\n\n\"Had another offer for the place yesterday, Ephraim.\"\n\n\"Dat so, Miss Betty? Grandes' place in Baltimo',\" responded the other,\nwho had heard but little of what she had said, but guessed sufficiently\nnear to answer sympathetically. Indeed, he was fully as proud of the\nancient estate as its present owner, and of the fact that, while he\ndwelt in the very heart of the southern city, his stables and\nappointments were quite as roomy as if an open country lay all about\nthem. His \"Miss Betty\" and he were the last of the \"family\"; he\nconsidered Bellevieu as much his as hers; and, from his throne upon the\nantiquated Calvert carriage, looked with charitable contempt upon the\ndrivers of less aristocratic vehicles.\n\nThe march of progress had left the mansion and its beautiful grounds\nuntouched. Entrenched behind her pride and her comfortable bank account,\nMrs. Betty Cecil Somerset-Calvert had withstood every assault upon the\nold place, whether made by private individual or, as yesterday, by the\ncity authorities, who wished to turn Bellevieu into a park. She had\nreplied to the committee that waited upon her:\n\n\"No, gentlemen, thank you. This house was one of the first built in the\ntown, though it was then what you call nowadays a 'suburban residence.'\nEach generation has received it intact from the preceding one, and\nintact it will descend to my heirs. What they will do with it remains to\nbe seen. I have the honor to wish you good-bye,\" she concluded, with her\ngrandest manner, yet the familiar local salutation of parting.\n\nThe committee felt itself dismissed and bowed itself out; and the old\nlady summoned her house-girl to open all the windows and ventilate the\nrooms contaminated by commercial presence. Then she consoled herself and\nthe poodle with the reflection:\n\n\"We shall be free from any more 'offers' for at least two weeks. Let us\nenjoy our freedom.\"\n\nYet Mrs. Cecil's pride did not prevent her taking the liveliest interest\nin her neighbors and their gossip. Having been born and passed all her\nlife at Bellevieu she knew everything which went on anywhere near it.\nEnsconced upon her broad piazzas, behind the venerable oaks and\nevergreens which shaded them, her bright old eyes watched the outer\nworld with the zest as of youth and utter loneliness. For alone she\ndwelt in the many-roomed house, that had once been filled by her now\nvanished \"family,\" and sometimes found her solitude unbearable. Even\npostman \"Johnnie's\" thrice-daily visits were a most welcome diversion to\nher, and lest there should be no mail sufficient to bring him so often\nto her door, she subscribed for all sorts of publications that she\nseldom opened, in order to have something due at every delivery.\n\nThis morning she was so anxious to see him again that she had her\nbreakfast served on the piazza, sitting down to wait for it as Ephraim\ndrove away toward the stable. It was brought to her by Dinah, grumbling\nas usual:\n\n\"Laws, Miss Betty, you-all shuah do try a body's tempah. It am puffickly\nridic'lous de way yo' ca'y on. Off drivin' from pillah to post 'fore\nbreakfast done served, an' you-all not so young an' spry like yo' used\nto was. Yeah am dem scrambled aigs done gone hard an' tough, like a\nnigger's skin, an' fust off Ah knows Ah'll have yo' laid up wid dat same\nold misery in yo' chist. Why-all cayn't yo' eat yo' breakfast in de\nhouse, propah, like a Christian, Miss Betty?\"\n\n\"Because I don't wish to, Dinah,\" retorted Mrs. Cecil, exactly as a\nspoiled child might have done.\n\n\"You-all know how old yo' be, Miss Betty?\" demanded the ancient negress,\nwho had been body-servant to her mistress from the earliest youth of\nboth and who was still indulged beyond limit in her freedom of speech\nand action.\n\n\"Yes, Dinah. I am just one year and a day younger than you are. Go tell\ncook to scramble me some more eggs; and if I prefer driving before to\nafter breakfast, that doesn't concern you, girl.\"\n\n\"Beg pahdon, Miss Betty, but it do concern. Didn't Ah done go promise\nyo' dyin' ma how't Ah't take ca' of you-all what'd nevah no sense to\ntake ca' yo'self? Huh! Yo' put dat shawl closeter 'roun' dem purty\nshouldahs o' yo's, whilst I go shame dat cook for sendin' up such\nno-'count aigs to my young miss!\" And away limped Dinah, the \"misery\"\nin her own limbs from her \"roomaticals\" being very severe.\n\nMeanwhile, in the little house around the corner, Mrs. John Chester was\nsuperintending another breakfast which had the delightful zest of\nnovelty about it. No sooner had Dorothy C. been taken within doors than\nshe espied the table which John-postman had so hastily quitted upon\nsound of her own laughter and, at once, began to kick and squirm in the\nhouse mistress's arms with such vigor that the good lady came near to\ndropping her, and exclaimed, in mingled fear and pride:\n\n\"Why, you strong little thing! You're as hard to hold as--as a human\neel! There, there, don't! You've slipped down so far all your clothes\nare over your head. Are you hungry? Well, well! You shall have all you\nwant to eat, for once!\"\n\nThen she placed the child on the floor while she filled a tumbler with\nmilk and offered it; but this was met by disdain and such another swift\ntoss of the baby arm that the glass flew out of the holder's hand, and\nits contents deluged the floor.\n\nWhereupon, Miss Dorothy C. threw herself backward with shrieks which\nmight mean anger or delight, but were equally confusing to the\norder-loving Mrs. Chester, who cried, in reproof:\n\n\"Oh! you naughty baby! Whoever you belong to should teach you better\nthan that! Now, just see. All my nice clean matting splashed with milk,\nand milk-grease is hard to get out. Now you lie there till I get a pail\nand cloth--if you hurt yourself I can't help it. John said you were a\njoke, but you're no joke to me!\"\n\nHaving just finished her spring cleaning and having had, for economy's\nsake, to do it all herself, the housewife's tidy soul was doubly tried,\nand she had a momentary desire to put the baby and her wagon out upon\nthe street again, to take its chances with somebody else. However, when\nshe re-entered with her pail and cloths, she was instantly diverted by\nthe sight that met her.\n\nDorothy C. had managed to pull her coat over her head and in some\nunknown fashion twist the strings of her bonnet around her throat, in an\neffort to remove the objectionable headgear. The result was disaster.\nThe more she pulled the tighter grew that band around her neck and her\nface was already blue from choking when Mrs. Chester uncovered it and\nrescued the child from strangling.\n\nAs the lady afterward described the affair to her husband it appeared\nthat:\n\n\"Seeing that, and her so nigh death, as it were, gave me the terriblest\nturn! So that, all unknown, down sits I in that puddle of milk as\ncareless as the little one herself. And I cuddled her up that close, as\nif I'd comforted lots of babies before, and me a green hand at the\nbusiness. To see her sweet little lip go quiver-quiver, and her big\nbrown eyes fill with tears--Bless you, John! I was crying myself in the\njerk of a lamb's tail! Then I got up, slipped off my wet skirt and got\nher out of her outside things, and there pinned to her dress was this\nnote. Read it out again, please, it so sort of puzzles me.\"\n\nSo the postman read all that they were to learn, for many and many a\nday, concerning the baby which had come to their home; and this is a\ncopy of that ill-spelled, rudely scrawled document:\n\n     \"thee child Is wun Yere an too Munths old hur burthDay is aPrill\n     Furst. til firthur notis Thar will Bee a letur in The posOfis the\n     furst of Everi mounth with Ten doLurs. to Pay.\" Signed:\n\n     \"dorothy's Gardeen\n     hur X mark.\"\n\nNow John Chester had been a postman for several years and he had learned\nto decipher all sorts of handwriting. Instantly, he recognized that this\nscrawl was in a disguised hand, wholly different from that upon the card\npinned to the child's coat, and that the spelling was also incorrect\nfrom a set purpose. Laying the two bits of writing together he carefully\nstudied them, and after a few moments' scrutiny declared:\n\n\"The same person wrote both these papers. The first one in a natural,\ncultivated hand, and a woman's. The second in a would-be-ignorant one,\nto divert suspicion. But--the writer didn't think it out far enough;\nelse she never would have given the same odd shape to her r's and that\ntwist to the tails of her y's. It's somebody that knows us, too,\nlikely, though I can't for the life of me guess who. What shall we do\nabout her? Send her to an Orphanage, ourselves? Or turn her over to the\npolice to care for, Martha dear?\"\n\nHis face was so grave that, for a moment, she believed him to be in\nearnest; then that sunny smile which was never long absent from his\nfeatures broke over them and in that she read the answer to her own\ndesire. To whomsoever Dorothy C. belonged, that heartless person had\npassed the innocent baby on to them and they might safely keep her for\ntheir own.\n\nOnly, knowing the extreme tidiness of his energetic wife, John finally\ncautioned:\n\n\"Don't settle it too hastily, Martha. By the snap of her brown eyes and\nthe toss of her yellow head, I foresee there'll be a deal more spilled\nmilk before we've done with her!\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" recklessly answered the housewife, \"_she's mine_!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA POSTAL SUBSTITUTE\n\n\nSo long a time had passed that Dorothy C. had grown to be what father\nJohn called \"a baker's dozen of years old\"; and upon another spring\nmorning, as fair as that when she first came to them, the girl was out\nupon the marble steps, scrubbing away most vigorously. The task was\nknown locally as \"doing her front,\" and if one wishes to be considerable\nrespectable, in Baltimore, one's \"front\" must be done every day. On\nSaturdays the entire marble facing of the basement must also be\npolished; but \"pernickity\" Mrs. Chester was known to her neighbors as\nsuch a forehanded housekeeper that she had her Saturday's work done on\nFriday, if this were possible.\n\nNow this was Friday and chanced to be a school holiday; so Dorothy had\nbeen set to the week-end task, which she hated; and therefore she put\nall the more energy into it, the sooner to have done with it, meanwhile\nsinging at the top of her voice. Then, when the postman came round the\ncorner of the block, she paused in her singing to stare at him for one\nbrief instant. The next she had pitched her voice a few notes higher\nstill, and it was her song that greeted her father's ears and set him\nsmiling in his old familiar fashion. Unfortunately, he had not been\nsmiling when she first perceived him and there had been a little catch\nin her tones as she resumed her song. Each was trying to deceive the\nother and each pretending that nothing of the sort was happening.\n\n\"Heigho, my child! At it again, giving the steps a more tombstone\neffect? Well, since it's the fashion--go ahead!\"\n\n\"I wish the man, or men, who first thought of putting scrubby-steps\nbefore people's houses had them all to clean himself! Hateful old\nthing!\"\n\nWith a comical gesture of despair she tossed the bit of sponge-stone,\nwith which she had been polishing, into the gutter and calmly seated\nherself on the bottom step, \"to get her breath.\" \"To get yours, too,\nfather dear,\" she added, reaching to the postman's hand and gently\ndrawing him down beside her. Then, because her stock of patience was\nalways small and she could not wait for his news, she demanded: \"Well!\nDid you go? What did he say?\"\n\n\"Yes, darling, I went,\" he answered, in a low tone and casting an\nanxious glance backward over his shoulder toward the house where Martha\nmight be near enough to hear. But having replied to one question he\nignored the rest.\n\nHowever, the girl was not to be put off by silence and her whole heart\nwas in her eyes as she leaned forward and peered into his. He still\ntried to evade her, but she was so closely bound up with his life, she\nunderstood him so quickly and naturally, that this was difficult; so\nwhen she commanded in her tender, peremptory way: \"Out with it, father\nmine, body and bones!\" he half-cried, half-groaned:\n\n\"Worse than all the others! _I--am--doomed!_\"\n\nThen he dropped his head on his hands and, regardless of the fact that\nthey were on the street, conspicuous to every passer-by, he gave way to\na mute despair. Now when a naturally light-hearted person breaks down\nthe collapse is complete, but Dorothy did not know this nor that\nrecovery is commonly very prompt. She was still staring in grieved\namazement at her father's bowed head when he again lifted it and flashed\na smile into her freshly astonished eyes. Then she laughed aloud, so\ngreat was her relief, and cried:\n\n\"There, father John! You've been fooling me again! I should have known\nyou were teasing and not believed you!\"\n\nBut he answered, though still smiling:\n\n\"It's pretty hard to believe the fact, myself. Yet it's true, all the\nsame. Five different doctors have agreed upon it--which is wonderful, in\nitself; and though I'd much rather not face this kind of a truth I\nreckon I'll have to; as well as the next question: What is to become of\nus?\"\n\nDorothy still retained her baby habit of wrinkling her nose when she was\nperplexed, and she did so now in an absurd earnestness that amused her\nfather, even in the midst of his heartache. During her twelve years of\nlife in the little brick house in Brown Street, she had made a deal of\ntrouble for the generous couple which had given her a home there, but\nshe had brought them so much more of happiness that they now believed\nthey actually could not live without her. As the postman expressed it:\n\n\"Her first act in this house was to spill her milk on its tidy floor.\nShe's been spilling milk all along the route from then till now, and\nlong may she spill! Martha'd be 'lost' if she didn't have all that care\nof the troublesome child.\"\n\nThis sunshiny morning, for the first time since that far-back day when\nshe arrived upon his doorstep, the good postman began to contemplate the\npossibility of their parting; and many schemes for her future welfare\nchased themselves through his troubled brain. If he could only spare\nMartha and Dorothy the unhappiness that had fallen upon himself he would\nask no more of fortune. For a long time they sat there, pondering, till\nMartha's voice recalled them to the present:\n\n\"For goodness sake, Dorothy C.! What are you idling like that for?\nDon't you know I've to go to market and you have the lunch to get? Then\nthere's that class picnic of yours, and what on earth will Miss Georgia\nsay if you don't go this time? Come, come! Get to work. I'm ashamed to\nhave the neighbors see my marble the way it is, so late in the day. You\nthere, too, John? Finished your beat already? Well, you come, too. I've\na mind to take up that dining-room carpet and put down the matting this\nvery day. I never was so late in my spring cleaning before, but every\ntime I say 'carpet' to you, you have an excuse to put me off. I confess\nI don't understand you, who've always been so handy and kind with my\nheavy jobs. But come, Dorothy, you needn't laze any longer. It beats\nall, the lots of talk you and your father always must have whenever you\nhappen to get alongside. Come.\"\n\nThere was a hasty exchange of glances between father and child; then she\nsprang up, laughing, and as if it were part of her fun held out her hand\nto the postman and pulled him to his feet. But it was not fun; it was\nmost painful, serious earnest. He could hardly have risen without her\naid, and she had noticed, what his wife had not, that, for a long time\nnow, he had never taken a seat without it was near a table, or some\nother firm object by which he could support himself in rising. Now, as\nhe loosed her hand and climbed the steps, he kept his gaze fixed upon\nthose same troublesome feet and caught hold of the brass hand-rail,\nwhich it was the housewife's pride and Dorothy's despair to keep\npolished to brilliancy.\n\nOnce within the house, Martha returned to the subject of the carpet\nlifting and again he put her off; but this time her suspicion that all\nwas not right had been aroused and, laying her hand upon his shoulder,\nshe demanded in a tone sharpened by sudden anxiety:\n\n\"John Chester, what is the matter with you?\"\n\nHe started, staggered by her touch, light as it was, and sank into a\nchair; then knowing that the truth must out sometime, almost hurled it\nat her--though smiling to think how little she would, at first,\ncomprehend:\n\n\"Oh! nothing but '_ataxy locomotor_.'\"\n\n\"But--_what_? Don't tease. I'm in earnest, and a hurry.\"\n\n\"So am I. In deadly earnest. I'm afflicted with '_ataxy locomotor_,' or\n_locomotor ataxia_. It's come to stay. To change our whole lives.\"\n\nShe hadn't the slightest idea what he meant, as he had surmised would be\nthe case, but something in his tone frightened her, though she answered\nwith a mirthful affectation:\n\n\"Humph! I'm glad it's something so respectable!\"\n\nThen she turned away, made ready to go to market, and soon left with her\nbasket on her arm. But she carried a now heavy heart within her. She had\nseen that underneath her husband's jesting manner lay some tragic truth;\nand in her preoccupied state, she bought recklessly of things she should\nnot and went home without those which were needful. So that once back\nthere, she had to dispatch Dorothy marketward again, while she herself\nprepared the simple lunch that served till their evening dinner which\nall enjoyed the more in the leisure of the day's work done. And now, in\nthe absence of the child they both so loved, husband and wife at length\ndiscussed the trouble that had befallen.\n\n\"Do you mean, John, that you are losing the use of your feet? What in\nthe world will a postman do without his sound feet and as sound a pair\nof legs above them?\" demanded the anxious housemistress, still unable to\naccept the dreadful fact.\n\n\"Nothing. I can't be a postman any longer. I must resign my position at\nonce. I've kept it longer than I should. I haven't done justice to\nmyself or the office in hanging on as I have. But----\"\n\n\"How long have you known about it?\"\n\n\"For several months I've noticed that my feet felt queer, but it's only\nbeen a few weeks since they became so uncontrollable. I've not been able\nto walk without keeping my eyes fixed on my toes. My legs have a wild\ndesire to fly out at right angles to my body and--Face it, little woman,\nface it! You have a cripple on your hands for as long as he may live.\"\n\n\"I haven't! You shan't be a--a cripple!\" protested the impulsive\nhousewife, whose greatest griefs, heretofore, had been simple domestic\nones which shrank to nothingness before this real calamity. Then she\nbowed her head on her arms and let the tears fall fast. This served to\nrelieve the tension of her nerves, and when she again lifted her head\nher face was calm as sad, while she made him tell her all the details of\nhis trouble. He had been to the best specialists in the city. That very\nday he had consulted the last, whom he had hoped might possibly help him\nand whose fee had staggered him by its size.\n\n\"How long has Dorothy known this?\" asked Martha, with a tinge of\njealousy.\n\n\"Almost from the beginning. It was quite natural that she should, for\nshe has so often run alongside me on my routes--going to and from\nschool. Besides, you know, she has the very sharpest eyes in the world.\nLittle escapes them. _Nothing_ escapes which concerns us whom she loves\nso dearly. It was her notion that you shouldn't be told till it was\nnecessary, but it fell in with my own ideas. I--I think, though I never\nheard of anybody else doing such a thing, that I'll have her go along\nwith me this afternoon, when I make my--my last rounds. I confess that\nsince that doctor's word, to-day, I've lost all my courage and my power\nto walk half-decently. Decently? It hasn't been that for a long time, so\nif you can spare her I'll have her go.\"\n\n\"Of course I can spare her. She was to go to a class picnic, anyway, but\nshe'd rather go with you. Now, I'll to work; and, maybe, I can think a\nway out of our trouble. I--I can't bear it, John! You, a cripple for\nlife! It can't be true--it shall not be true. But--if it has to\nbe,--well, you've worked for me all these years and it's a pretty\nhow-de-do if I can't work for you in turn. Now, lie down on the lounge\ntill it's time to go to the office again, and I'll tackle my kitchen\nfloor.\"\n\nFor the first time he allowed her to help him across the room and to\nplace him comfortably on the lounge, and she suddenly remembered how\noften, during the past few weeks, she had seen Dorothy do this very same\nthing. She had laughed at it as a foolish fondness in the girl, but now\nshe offered the assistance with a bitter heartache.\n\nDorothy came back and was overjoyed at the changed program for her\nholiday afternoon. All along she had longed to go with the postman, to\nhelp him, but had not been permitted. Now it was not only a relief that\nher mother knew their secret and that they could talk it over together,\nbut she had formed a scheme by which she believed everything could go on\nvery much as before.\n\nSo with a cane in one hand and his other resting on her shoulder, John\nChester made his last \"delivery.\" Fortunately, the late mail of the day\nwas always small and the stops, therefore, infrequent. Most of these,\ntoo, were at houses fronting directly on the street, so that the postman\ncould support himself against the end of the steps while Dorothy ran up\nthem and handed in the letters.\n\nIt was different at Bellevieu, which chanced to be the end of that trip,\nand the long path from the gateway to the mansion looked so formidable\nto father John that he bade Dorothy go in alone with the pouch, emptied\nnow of all matter save that addressed to Mrs. Cecil.\n\nShe sped away, leaving him leaning against the stone pillar of the\neagle-gate--so called because each column guarding the entrance was\ntopped by a massive bronze eagle--and waved a smiling farewell to him as\nshe disappeared beneath the trees bordering the driveway.\n\nAs usual, Mrs. Cecil was on her piazza, wrapped in shawls and protected\nby her hooded beach-chair from any possible wind that might blow. Old\nthough she was, her eyes were almost as brown and bright as Dorothy's\nown, and they opened in surprise at the appearance of this novel\nmail-carrier.\n\n\"How-d'ye-do, Mrs. Cecil? Here's such a lot of letters and papers all\nfor you!\" cried Dorothy, bowing, as she swept her hand through the pouch\nwhich she had slung over her shoulder in the most official manner.\n\"Where shall I put them? I reckon there are too many for your lap.\"\n\n\"What--who--Where's Johnnie?\" demanded the lady, leaning forward and\nfirst smiling, then frowning upon the girl.\n\n\"Oh! he--he's at the gate,\" she answered, and was about to explain why\nhe had not come himself. Then a sudden remembrance of how closely he had\nguarded his secret, even from her mother, closed her lips, leaving the\nother to infer what she chose; and who promptly exclaimed:\n\n\"Well, of all things! Do you know, does he know, that between you the\nlaw is broken? Nobody, except a regularly sworn employee has a right to\ntouch the United States mail. How dare he send you? Huh! If I do my duty\nas a good citizen I shall report him at once. This single breach of\nfaith may cost him his place, even though he has been in the service so\nlong.\"\n\nMrs. Cecil's manner was harsher than her thought. For some time she had\nobserved that \"Johnnie\" looked ill and was far less active than of old\nand she had intended that very afternoon to offer him a kindness. She\nwould send him and his wife away on a long vacation, wherever they chose\nto go, till he could recover his health. She would pay all his expenses,\nincluding a substitute's salary. Even more generous than all, she would\ninvite that girl, Dorothy C., whom they had so foolishly adopted, to\npass the interval of their absence at Bellevieu. She dreaded the\ninfliction of such a visit. She always had insisted that she hated\nchildren--but--Well, it was to be hoped the postman would have sense\nenough to speedily recuperate and take Dorothy off her hands. In any\ncase, she must be gotten rid of before it was time for Mrs. Cecil\nherself to seek recreation at her summer home in the Hudson highlands.\n\nNow her mood suddenly changed. She had desired to befriend the postman\nbut, if he had taken it into his hands to befriend himself, it was quite\nanother matter. Let him! Why should she bother with anybody in such a\ndifferent state of life? Disappointment, at having her prospective\nkindness returned upon her thus, made her sharply say:\n\n\"It takes all kinds of fools to fill a world, and I'm sorry to find\nJohnnie one of them. Don't stare! It's rude, with such big eyes as\nyours. Drop the mail. Carriers shouldn't loiter--that's another crime.\nYour father must come himself next time, else----\"\n\nShe seemed to leave some dire threat unspoken and again Dorothy was just\nready to tell this strange old lady, whom the postman had often called\n\"wise,\" the truth of the trouble that had come to him; when around the\ncorner of the house dashed Peter and Ponce, the two Great Dane dogs\nwhich Mrs. Cecil kept as a menace to intruders. They had just been\nloosed for their evening exercise and, wild with delight, were hurrying\nto their mistress on her broad porch.\n\nAt the sight of their onrush Dorothy caught up the pouch she had dropped\nand started to retreat--too late! The animals were upon her, had knocked\nher downward and backward, striking her head against the boards and, for\nthe moment, stunning her. But they had been more playful than vicious\nand were promptly restrained by Mrs. Cecil's own hand upon their\ncollars; while the brief confusion of the girl's startled thoughts as\nquickly cleared and she leaped to her feet, furiously angry and\nindignant.\n\n\"Oh! the horrid beasts! How dare you--anybody--keep such dangerous\ncreatures? I'll tell my father! He'll--he'll--\" tears choked her further\nspeech and, still suspiciously eyeing the Danes, she was edging\ncautiously down the steps when she felt herself stopped.\n\nMrs. Cecil had loosed her hold of Peter to lay her hand upon the girl's\nshoulder and she was saying, kindly but sternly:\n\n\"They are not dangerous but playful. They attack nobody upon whom they\nare not 'set.' It was an accident; and if any further apology is\nnecessary it is from a little girl to the old gentlewoman--for an\ninsolent suspicion. Now go. The dogs will not follow you.\"\n\nDorothy did not see how she had done wrong, yet she felt like a culprit\ndismissed as she lifted the pouch she had again dropped and started\ngateward, still keeping a wary eye upon the beautiful dogs, now lying\nbeside their mistress in her beach-chair.\n\nAs she neared the entrance she cried:\n\n\"Here I am at last, father! I didn't mean to stay so long but that\ndreadful old woman--Why, father, father! Where are you, dearest father?\"\n\nHe was nowhere to be seen. Nor anybody, either on the broad avenue or\nthe narrow street around the corner; and when she came breathlessly to\nthe dear home in which she hoped to find him it was empty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAT JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL\n\n\nThe door of No. 77 Brown Street stood wide open. Any of the burglars for\nwhom its mistress was always on the watch might have raided the tiny\nparlor or made off with father John's Sunday overcoat, hanging upon the\nhat-rack. Now also, while Dorothy hurried from room to room of the six\nwhich were all the house contained, the wind of a rising thunderstorm\nwhistled through them and their open windows. Nor was there any reply to\nher anxious calls:\n\n\"Mother! Father! Anybody--somebody! Oh! where are you? What has\nhappened? Mother--dearest mother Martha! Won't you answer?\"\n\nCertainly, this was a strange, a terrifying state of things. It was\namazing that so careful a housewife as Martha Chester should leave her\nhome in this unprotected condition, but it was quite natural for the\nwell-trained girl, even in the midst of her alarm, to close the sashes\nagainst the rain that now came dashing in.\n\nThen she hurried below and out into the little yard, or garden, that was\nher own special delight. Nobody there; but the pail and brush which Mrs.\nChester had been using to clean her back kitchen were still upon its\nfloor, the pail overturned and the water puddling its bricks, and the\nsight made Dorothy's heart sink lower yet.\n\nHurrying back to the street, a neighbor shielded her own head from the\ndownpour and called from a next-door window:\n\n\"Something has happened to your father. A boy saw him picked up on the\nstreet and a policeman called a Johns Hopkins ambulance, that took him\nto the hospital. The boy knew him, told your mother, and she's hurried\nthere. Don't worry. Probably it's nothing serious.\"\n\n\"Not serious! Oh! you don't know what you're saying! And to think I left\nhim only such a little while! If that hateful old woman--I must go to\nhim, too, I must, I must!\"\n\nWith that Dorothy was retreating indoors, but again the neighbor's voice\ndetained her:\n\n\"'Tisn't likely you'd be admitted, even if you did go. You'd better stay\nhere and be ready for your poor mother when she comes. It's worse\ntrouble for her than for you.\"\n\nThis might be so and the advice excellent, but the excited girl was in\nno mood to profit by it. Once, in her early childhood, she had answered\nto an inquiry: \"I love my mother a _little_ the best, but I love my\nfather the _biggest_ the best!\" and it was so still. Her father, her\ncheery, indulgent, ever-tender father, would always be \"the biggest the\nbest\" of her earthly friends, and to be absent from him now, not knowing\nwhat had befallen, was impossible.\n\nGlancing upward she observed that the neighbor had already withdrawn her\nhead from the dashing rain and was glad of it. It left her free to bang\nthe front door shut, to rush backward through the house and out at the\nalley gate, which she also shut, snapping its lock behind her. But she\nhad caught up the key that opened it and, hanging this in a crevice of\nthe fence known for a safe hiding place to each of the family, she\nstarted eastward for the great hospital.\n\nThough she had never entered the famous place, she had seen it once from\na street-car, and love guided her flying feet. But it was a long, long\nway from Brown Street, and the present storm was one of those deluging\n\"gusts\" familiar to the locality. Within the first five minutes the\ngutters were filled, the muddy streams pushing outward toward the very\nmiddle of the narrower alleys and quite covering her shoe-tops as she\nsplashed through. At one or two of the older thoroughfares she came to\nthe old-time \"stepping stones,\" provided for just such emergencies, and\nstill left standing because of the city's pride in their antiquity. Over\nthese she leaped and was glad of them, but alas! the storm was having\nits will of her. Her gingham frock was soaked and clung about her with a\nhindering obstinacy that vexed her, and her wet shoes grew intolerable.\nShe did not remember that she had ever gone barefoot, as some of her\nmates had done, but at last she sat down on a doorstep and took off her\nshoes and stockings. After a moment's contemplation of their ruined\nstate, she threw them far aside and stepped upon the brick pavement,\njust as a policeman in oilskins came up and laid his hand on her\nshoulder, asking:\n\n\"Little girl, what are you doing?\"\n\nDorothy sprang aside, frightened, and wriggled herself free. She forgot\nthat she had never been afraid of such officers; that, indeed, the one\nupon her own home beat was the friend of all the youngsters on the\nblock, and that this one could give her the shortest direction to the\nplace she sought. She had long ago been taught that, if she were ever\nlost or in any perplexity upon the street, she should call upon the\nnearest policeman for aid and that it was his sworn duty to assist her.\nShe remembered only that it was a policeman who had summoned the\nambulance that had carried her father to that horrible place--a\nhospital! Well, she, too, was bound for it, but only to snatch him\nthence; and stretching out her small, drenched arms, she wondered if\nthey and mother Martha's together would have strength to lift and seize\nhim.\n\nThen on and on and on! Could one city be so big as this? Did ever brick\npavements hurt anybody else as they were hurting her? How many more\nblocks must she traverse before she came in sight of that wide Broadway\nwith its pretty parks, on which the hospital stood?\n\nEverybody had retreated indoors. Nobody who could escape the fury of the\nstorm endured it, and she had left the officer who could have guided her\nfar behind. But, at last, a slackening of the downpour; and as if by\nmagic, people reappeared upon the street; though of the first few whom\nshe addressed none paused to listen. Yet, finally, a colored boy came\nhurrying by, his basket of groceries upon his arm, and another empty\nbasket inverted over his head, by way of an umbrella. Him she clutched,\ndemanding with what little of breath she had left:\n\n\"The--way--to--Johns Hopkins'--hospital, please!\"\n\n\"Hey? Horspittle? Wha' for?\"\n\n\"To find my father, who's been taken there. Oh! tell me the shortest\nway, please--please--please! I am so tired! and I must be--I must be\nquick--quick!\"\n\nA look of pity and consternation stole into the negro's face, and he\ndrew in his breath with a sort of gasp as he answered:\n\n\"Laws, honey, I reckon yo' _mus'_ be 'quick'! But de quickes' yo' is\nain' half quick enough. Know wha' dem horspittles is for? Jus' to cut up\nfolkses in. Fac'. Dey goes in alibe, dey comes out deaders. Yo' jus'\ndone cal'late yo' ain' got no paw no mo'. He's had his haid, or his\nlaig, or both his arms sawed off 'fore you-all more'n got started\na-chasin' of him. Po' li'l gal! Pity yo' got so wet in de rain jus' fo'\nnottin'! Wheah yo' live at? Yo' bettah go right home an' tell yo' folks\ntake dem cloes off, 'fore you-all done get de pneumony.\"\n\nDorothy was shivering, partly from nervousness, partly from the chill of\nwet garments in the strong breeze. Though she had often heard the\npostman comment upon the superstitions of the negroes, who formed so\nlarge a part of the city's population, and knew that such ideas as this\nlad expressed were but superstition only, she could not help being\nimpressed by his words. It was his honest belief that to enter a\nhospital meant giving himself up to death; and in this ignorance he\nreasoned that this forlorn child should be prevented from such\nself-destruction by any means whatever. So when she still pleaded to be\ndirected, despite the fear he had raised in her, he whirled abruptly\nabout and pointed his hand in a direction wholly different from that she\nhad followed. Then he added with a most dramatic air:\n\n\"Well, honey, if you-all done daid-set to go get yo' laigs sawed off,\ntravel jus' dat-a-way till yo' come to de place. Mebbe, if dey gibs yo'\ndat stuff what makes yo' go asleep, you-all won't know nottin' erbout de\njob.\"\n\nWith this cheerful assurance the grocer's boy went his way, musically\nwhistling a popular tune, and Dorothy gazed after him in deep\nperplexity. Fortunately, the rain had almost ceased and the brief halt\nhad restored her breath. Then came the reflection:\n\n\"He wasn't telling the truth! I know that isn't the way at all, for\nJohns Hopkins is on the east of the city, and that's toward the north.\nI'll ask somebody else. There are plenty of people and wagons coming out\nnow; and--Oh! my!\"\n\nAs if in answer to her thought, there came the clang of an electric\nbell, the hurrying delivery wagons drew out of the way, and past her,\nover the clear space thus given, dashed another ambulance, hastening to\nthe relief of some poor sufferer within. On its side she saw the name of\nthe hospital she sought and with frantic speed dashed after this\ntrustworthy guide.\n\nThough she could by no means keep up with its speed she did keep it well\nin sight, to the very entrance of the wide grounds themselves, and there\nshe lost it. But it didn't matter now. Her journey was almost done, and\nthe building loomed before her, behind whose walls was hidden her\nbeloved father John.\n\nFrom the gateway up the incline to the broad hospital steps she now\ndragged her strangely reluctant feet. How, after all, could she enter\nand learn some dreadful truth? But she must, she must! and with a final\nburst of courage she rushed into the great entrance hall, which was so\nsilent, so beautiful after the storm outside; and there appeared before\nher half-blinded eyes a figure as of one coming to meet her.\n\nAll alone the figure stood, with nothing near to detract from its\nmajestic tenderness; so large and powerful looking; as if able to bear\nall the burdens of a troubled world and still smile peace upon it.\nSlowly, Dorothy crept now to the very feet of the statue and read that\nthis was: \"Christ the Healer.\"\n\nAh! then! No hospital could be a wicked, murderous place in which He\ndwelt! and with a sigh of infinite relief, the exhausted child sank down\nand laid her head upon Him. And then all seemed to fade from view.\n\nThe next Dorothy knew she was lying on a white cot; a blue-gowned,\nwhite-capped nurse was bending over her, and a pleasant voice was\nsaying:\n\n\"Well, now that's good! You've had a splendid rest and must be quite\nready for your supper. Here's a fine bowl of broth, and some nice toast.\nShall I help you to sit up?\"\n\n\"Why--why--what's the matter with me? Where am I? Have----\" began the\nastonished child; then, suddenly remembering the colored boy's\nassertions concerning this dreadful place, she instinctively thrust her\nhands below the light bed covering and felt of her legs. They were still\nboth there! So were her arms; and, for a matter of fact, she was\ndelightfully rested and comfortable. Again lying back upon her pillow,\nshe smiled into the nurse's face and asked:\n\n\"What am I doing here, in a bed? Is this the hospital?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, it is; and you are in bed because you fainted in the\nentrance hall, exhausted by exposure to the terrible storm. That is\nall--we trust. Now, drink your broth and take another nap if you can.\"\n\nThere was authority, as well as gentleness, in the tone and the patient\ntried to obey; but this time there was a sharp pain at the back of her\nhead and her neck seemed strangely stiff. With a little exclamation of\ndistress, she put her hand on the painful spot, and the attendant\nquickly asked:\n\n\"Does that hurt you? Can you remember to have had a blow, or a fall,\nlately?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. The big dogs knocked me down over at Bellevieu. It made me\nblind for a few minutes, but I was too mad to stay blind! If it hadn't\nbeen for that--Oh! please, where _is_ my father?\" answered Dorothy.\n\n\"Your father? I don't know. Have you lost, or missed, him, dear?\"\nreturned the other, understanding now why such a healthy child should\nhave collapsed as she had, there at the feet of the beautiful statue.\nExcitement, exposure, and the blow; these accounted for the condition in\nwhich a house doctor had found her. Also, there was nothing to hinder\nprompt recovery if the excitement could be allayed; and to this end the\nnurse went on:\n\n\"Tell me about him, little girl. Maybe I can help you, and don't worry\nabout being here. It is the very loveliest place in the world for ailing\npeople and nothing shall hurt you.\"\n\nSo Dorothy told all she knew; of the long weeks past when the postman's\nactive feet had become more and more troublesome; of his sudden\ndisappearance; and of her now terrible fear that, since the poor feet\nwere of so little use, these hospital surgeons would promptly \"saw\" them\noff and so be rid of them.\n\nRipples of amusement chased themselves across the nurse's fair face as\nshe listened, yet beneath them lay a sympathetic seriousness which kept\ndown Dorothy's anger, half-roused by the fleeting smiles.\n\n\"Well, my dear, neither he nor you could have come to a better place to\nget help. The very wisest doctors in the country are here, I believe.\nIt's a disease with a long name, I fancy----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! I know it! He told me. It's 'locomort'--'loco' something,\n'at'--'at' something else. It's perfectly horrible just to hear it, and\nwhat must it be to suffer it? But he never complains. My father John is\nthe bravest, dearest, best man in the world!\"\n\n\"Indeed? Then you should be the 'bravest, dearest, best' little daughter\nas well. And we'll hope some help, some cure, can be found for him. Now,\nwill you go to sleep?\"\n\n\"No. If you please I will go home. But I don't see my clothes anywhere.\nFunny they should take away a little girl's clothes just 'cause she\nforgot and went to sleep in the wrong place!\"\n\n\"In the very right-est place in all the world, dear child! At the\nSaviour's feet. Be sure nothing but goodness and kindness rule over the\nhospital whose entrance He guards. Your clothes are drying in the\nlaundry. You will, doubtless, have them in the morning, and, so far as I\ncan judge now, there'll be nothing to prevent your going home then,\"\ncomforted the nurse, gently stroking Dorothy's brow and by her touch\nsoothing the pain in it. Oddly enough, though her head had ached\nintensely, ever since that tumble on Mrs. Cecil's piazza, she had not\npaid any attention to it while her anxious search continued. She was\nfast drowsing off again, but roused for an instant to ask:\n\n\"Have you seen my father? Did he hurt himself when he fell? Did he fall?\nWhat did happen to him, anyway? Mayn't I see him just a minute, just one\nlittle minute, 'fore this--this queer sleepiness gets me?\"\n\n\"My dear, you can ask as many questions as a Yankee! I'll tell you what\nI think: Your father was probably taken to the emergency ward. I have\nnothing to do with that. My place is here, in the children's ward; and\nthe first thing nurses--or children--learn in this pleasant room\nis--obedience. I have my orders to obey and one of them is to prevent\ntalking after certain hours.\"\n\n\"You--you a big, grown-up woman, have to 'obey'? How funny!\" cried\nDorothy, thinking that the face beneath the little white cap was almost\nthe very sweetest she had ever seen. But to this the other merely\nnodded, then went softly away.\n\nDorothy lay in a little room off from the general ward, into which the\nnurse had disappeared, and where there was the sound of low-toned\nconversation, with an occasional fretful cry from some unseen baby. The\ndoctor, or interne as he was called, making his night rounds, seeing\nthat all his little charges were comfortable for their long rest, and\ndiscussing with the blue-gowned assistant their needs and conditions. It\nwas he who had found Dorothy, unconscious on the tiles, and had ordered\nher to bed; and it was of herself, had she known it, that he and the\nnurse had just been talking. As a result of this he merely looked in at\nthe door of the little room, blinked a good-night from behind his\nspectacles, which, like two balls of fire, reflected the electric light\nabove the door, and passed on.\n\nDorothy intended to keep awake. For a long time her head had been full\nof various schemes by which she should rise to the support of her\nfamily, whenever that day foreseen by the postman should arrive when his\nown support should fail. The day had come! Very suddenly, after all, as\neven the best-prepared-for catastrophes have a way of doing; and now,\ndespite her earnest desires--Dorothy was going to sleep! She was\nashamed of herself. She must stay awake and think--think--think! She\nsimply _must_--she----\n\n\"Well, Dorothy C., good morning! A nice, dutiful daughter, you, to run\naway and leave mother Martha alone all night!\"\n\nThat was the next she knew! That was Mrs. Chester's voice, speaking in\nthat familiar tone a reproof which was no reproof at all, but only a\nloving satisfaction. And there she sat, the tidy little woman, in her\nsecond-best hat and gown, smiling, smiling, as if there were no such\nthing as trouble in the world! as if both husband and child were not, at\nthat very moment, lying in hospital beds!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nDOROTHY GAINS IN WISDOM\n\n\n\"Why, mother! Why--why--_mother_!\" cried the astonished Dorothy, sitting\nup in her cot and smiling back into the happy face before her, yet\nwondering at its happiness and her own heartlessness, in being glad\nwhile her father was so ill. Then she realized that her neck was very\nstiff and that when she tried to turn her head it moved with a painful\nwrench, so sank back again, but still gazed at Mrs. Chester with a\ngrieved amazement.\n\nSeeing which, the lady bent over the cot and kissed the little girl,\nthen promptly explained:\n\n\"You needn't be troubled, dearie, this is the very best thing that could\nhave happened to us. Your father tired of waiting for you, his head was\ndizzy, and when he tried to walk home he fell. They hurried him\nhere--his uniform showed he was somebody important--and into that\nemergency place. There the doctors examined him and they say, O Dorothy\nC.! they say that there is a chance, a chance of his sometime _getting\nwell_! Think of that! John may get well! All those other outside\ndoctors, that he paid so much to, told him he never could. He'd just\ngrow worse and worse till--till he died. These don't. They say he has a\nchance. He's to stay here and be built up on extra nourishments, for\nawhile, and then he's to go into the country and live. Oh! I'm the\nhappiest woman in Baltimore, this day! And how is my little girl? Though\nthe nurse tells me there's nothing much the matter with you, and that\nyou'll be able to go home with me as soon as you have had your\nbreakfast. Such a late breakfast, Dorothy C., for a schoolgirl! Lucky\nit's a Saturday!\"\n\nDorothy had never seen her mother like this. At home, when trifles went\nwrong, she was apt to be a bit sharp-tongued and to make life\nuncomfortable for father John and their daughter, but now, that this\nreal trouble had befallen, she was so gay! For, even if there was hope\nthat the postman might sometime recover, was he not still helpless in a\nhospital? And had she forgotten that they had no money except his\nsalary? which would stop, of course, since he could no longer earn it.\nIt was certainly strange; and seeing the gravity steal into the childish\nface which was so dear to her, mother Martha stooped above it and, now\nherself wholly grave, explained:\n\n\"My dear, don't think I'm not realizing everything. But, since I've been\nonce face to face with the possibility that death--_death_--was coming\nto our loved one and now learn that he will still live, as long as I do,\nmaybe, I don't care about anything else. God never shuts one door but He\nopens another; and we'll manage. Some way we'll manage, sweetheart, to\ncare for father John who has so long cared for us. Now, enough of talk.\nHere comes a maid with your breakfast; and see. There are your clothes,\nas fresh and clean as if I had laundered them myself. Maybe you should\ndress yourself before you eat. Then you are to see your father for a few\nminutes; and then we'll go home to pack up.\"\n\nIt was long since Mrs. Chester had helped Dorothy to dress, except on\nsome rare holiday occasion, but she did so now, as if the girl were\nstill the baby she had found upon her doorstep. She, also, made such\nplay of the business that the other became even more gay than herself,\nand chattered away of all that had befallen her, from her discovery of\nthe deserted home till now.\n\nThen came the nice breakfast, so heartily enjoyed that the nurse smiled,\nknowing there could be nothing seriously amiss with so hungry a patient.\nAfterward, a quiet walk through long corridors and spacious halls, from\nwhich they caught glimpses of cots with patients in them, and passed by\nwheeled chairs in which convalescents were enjoying a change.\n\n\"It's so still! Does nobody ever speak out loud?\" whispered Dorothy to\nher mother, half-afraid of her own footfalls, though she now wore a pair\nof felt slippers in place of the shoes she had yesterday discarded.\n\"It's the biggest, cleanest, quietest place I could even dream of!\"\n\nBut Mrs. Chester did not answer, save by a nod and a finger upon lip;\nand so following the guide assigned them, they came to one of the open\nbridges connecting two of the hospital buildings, and there was father\nJohn, in a rolling chair, wearing a spotless dressing-gown, and holding\nout both hands toward them, while his eyes fairly shone with delight. An\norderly, in a white uniform, was pushing the chair along the bridge,\nwhich was so wide and looked down upon such beautiful grounds that it\nreminded Dorothy of Bellevieu, and he stopped short at their approach.\nHe even stepped back a few paces, the better to leave them free for\ntheir interview.\n\nBut if there was any emotion to be displayed at that meeting, it was not\nof a gloomy sort; and it was almost in his wife's very words that the\npostman exclaimed:\n\n\"To think I should get impatient, lose my head, tumble down, and--up\ninto this fine place! Where I've heard the best of news and live like a\nlord! Who wouldn't give his legs a rest, for a spell, if he could have\nsuch a chair as this to loll in while another man does his walking for\nhim! Well, how's the girl? Why, since when have you taken to wearing\nslippers so much too big for you? I should think they'd bother you in\nwalking as much as my limpsy feet did me.\"\n\nNothing escaped this cheery hospital patient even now, and before Mrs.\nChester could interpose, Dorothy had told her own tale and how she had\nbeen a hospital patient herself. How now she had been \"discharged\" and\nwas ready to go home with all her legs and arms intact, a thing she had\nfeared might not be the case when she had ventured thither.\n\n\"To think I should have been so silly as to believe that poor boy! Or\nthat, if I had followed his wrong directions, I shouldn't have gotten\nhere at all. Oh! isn't it beautiful! What makes some of the women dress\nall in white and some in blue? When I grow up I believe I'll be a\nhospital nurse myself.\"\n\n\"Good idea. Excellent. Stick to it. See if you can make that notion last\nas long as that other one about being a great artist; or, yes, the next\nscheme was to write books--books that didn't 'preach' but kept folks\nlaughing all the way through.\"\n\n\"Now, father! You needn't tease, and you haven't answered, about the\ndifferent dresses. Do you know, already?\" protested Dorothy, kissing his\nhand that rested on the arm of his chair.\n\n\"Oh! yes, I know. The orderly explained, for I wasn't any wiser than you\nbefore he did. The blue girls are 'probationers,' or under-graduates.\nThey have to study and take care of cranky sick folks for three whole\nyears before they can wear those white clothes. Think of that, little\nMiss Impatience, before you decide on the business! Three years. That's\na long time to be shut up with aches and pains and groans. But a noble\nlife. One that needs patience; even more than the Peabody course!\"\n\nThey all laughed, even Dorothy who was being teased. After any new\nexperience, it was her propensity immediately to desire to continue the\ndelightful novelty. After a visit to a famous local picture gallery, she\nhad returned home fully intent upon becoming an artist who should be,\nalso, famous. To that end she had wasted any number of cheap pads and\npencils, and had littered her mother's tidy rooms with \"sketches\"\ngalore. When she had gone with a schoolmate to a Peabody recital, she\nhad been seized with the spirit of music and had almost ruined a\nnaturally sweet voice--as well as the hearers' nerves--by a\nself-instructed course of training, which her teasing father had\nsometimes likened to a cat concert on a roof. However, upon learning\nthat it required many years of steady practise and that her life must be\nfilled with music--music alone--if she ever hoped to graduate from the\nInstitute, she abandoned the idea and aspired to literature.\n\nSo from one ambition to another, her almost too active mind veered; but\nher wise guardians allowed it free scope, believing that, soon or late,\nit would find the right direction and that for which nature had really\nfitted her. The greatest disappointment the postman had felt, concerning\nthese various experiments, was about the music. He was almost\npassionately fond of it, and rarely passed even a street organ without\na brief pause to listen. Except, of course, when he had been upon his\nrounds. Then he forced himself past the alluring thing, even if he had\nhimself to whistle to keep it out of mind. This habit of his had gained\nfor him the nickname, along his beat, of the \"whistling postman\"; and,\nhad he known it, there were many regrets among those who had responded\nto his whistle as promptly as to his ring of the bell that they should\nhear the cheerful sound no more.\n\nThe news of his collapse had quickly spread, for a new postman was\nalready on his route, and it was only at Bellevieu, where \"Johnnie\"\nwould be most missed, that it was not known.\n\nThe eagle-gate was shut. Ephraim was not to drive his fat horses through\nit that morning, nor for many more to come. During the night Mrs. Cecil\nhad been taken ill with one of her periodical bronchial attacks, of\nwhich she made so light, but her physician and old Dinah so much. To\nthem her life seemed invaluable; for they, better than anybody else,\nknew of her wide-spread yet half-hidden charities, and they would keep\nher safely in her room, as long as this were possible.\n\nAfter a time, the invalid would take matters into her own hands and\nreturn to her beloved piazza; for she was the only one not frightened by\nher own condition, and was wont to declare:\n\n\"I shall live just as long, and have just as many aches, as the dear\nLord decrees. When He's through with me here He'll let me know, and all\nyour fussing, Dinah, won't avail. My father was ninety, my mother\nninety-seven when they died. We're tough old Maryland stock, not easily\nkilled.\"\n\nIndeed, frail though Mrs. Cecil looked, it was the fragility of extreme\nslenderness rather than health; and it was another pride of Dinah's that\nher Miss Betty had still almost the figure of a girl. Occasionally, even\nyet, the lady would sit to read with a board strapped across her\nshoulders, as she had been used when in her teens, to keep them erect;\nand it was her boast that she had kept her \"fine shape\" simply because\nnever, in all her life, had she suffered whalebone or corset to\ninterfere with nature.\n\nThis Saturday morning, therefore, a colored boy waited beneath the\neagles, to receive his mistress's mail and to prevent the ringing of the\ngate-bell, which might disturb her. In passing him, on her way home,\nDorothy noticed the unusual circumstance and thought how much the\ngossip-loving dame would miss her ever-welcome \"Johnnie.\" But she was\nnow most fully engrossed by her own affairs and did not stop to\nenlighten him.\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Mrs. Chester and she had gone downtown to\nreplace the shoes and stockings so recklessly discarded the day before;\nDorothy hobbling along in the felt slippers and declaring that she would\nsuffer less if she were barefooted. But her mother had answered:\n\n\"No, indeed! I'd be ashamed to be seen with such a big girl as you in\nthat condition. Besides, I must get some new things for John. So, while\nI select the nightshirts and wrapper he needs, you go into the shoe\ndepartment and buy for yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother! May I? I never bought any of my clothes alone. How nice\nand grown-up I feel! May I get just what I like?\"\n\n\"Yes. Only, at the outside, you must not pay more than two dollars for\nthe shoes, nor above a quarter for the stockings. I could scold you for\nspoiling your old ones, if I were not too thankful about your father to\nscold anybody.\"\n\nSo they parted by the elevator in the great store, and with even more\nthan her native enthusiasm Dorothy plunged into these new delights of\nshopping. The clerk first displayed a substantial line of black shoes,\nas seemed most suitable to a young girl in the plainest of gingham\nfrocks; but the small customer would have none of these. Said she:\n\n\"No, I don't like that kind. Please show me the very prettiest ties you\nhave for two dollars a pair,\" and she nodded her head suggestively\ntoward a glass case wherein were displayed dainty slippers of varying\nhues. There were also white ones among them, and Dorothy remembered that\nher chum, Mabel Bruce, had appeared at Sunday school the week before,\nwearing such, and had looked \"too lovely for words.\" But then, of\ncourse, Mabel's frock and hat were also white and her father was the\nplumber. When Dorothy had narrated the circumstance to father John, and\nhad sighed that she was \"just suffering for white shoes,\" he had laughed\nand declared that:\n\n\"Plumbers were the only men rich enough to keep their daughters shod\nthat way!\"\n\nBut she saw now that he was mistaken. These beauties which the rather\nsupercilious clerk was showing her didn't cost a cent more than the\nlimit she had been allowed. Indeed, they were even less. They were\nmarked a \"special sale,\" only one dollar ninety-seven cents. Why, she\nwas saving three whole cents by taking them, as well as pleasing\nherself.\n\nThe transaction was swiftly closed. White stockings were added to the\npurchase, on which, also, the shopper saved another two cents, so that\nshe felt almost a millionaire as she stepped out of the shoe department\nand around to the elevator door, where she was to meet her mother. The\nlady promptly arrived but had not finished her own errands; nor, in the\ncrowd, could she see her daughter's feet and the manner of their\nclothing. She simply held out her front-door key to the girl and bade\nher hurry home, to put the little house in order for the coming Sabbath.\n\nThus Dorothy's fear that her mother might disapprove her choice was\nallayed for the time being. She would not be sent back to that clerk,\nwho had jested about the felt slippers in a manner the young shopper\nfelt was quite ill-bred, to ask him to exchange the white shoes for\nblack ones. So she stepped briskly forth, keeping her own gaze fixed\nadmiringly upon the snowy tips which peeped out from beneath her short\nskirts, and for a time all went well. She managed to avoid collision\nwith the bargain-morning shoppers all about her and she wholly failed to\nsee the amused faces of those who watched her.\n\nOn the whole, Dorothy C. was as sensible a girl as she was a bright one;\nbut there's nobody perfect, and she was rather unduly vain of her\nshapely hands and feet. They were exceedingly small and well-formed, and\nthough the hands had not been spared in doing the rough tasks of life,\nwhich fall to the lot of humble bread-earners, her father John had\ninsisted that his child's feet should be well cared for. He, more than\nMartha, had seen in their adopted daughter traces of more aristocratic\norigin than their own; and he had never forgotten the possibility that\nsometime she might be reclaimed.\n\nUsually Dorothy walked home from any downtown trip, to market or\notherwise, and set out briskly to do so now. But, all at once, a\nhorrible pain started in the toes of her right foot! She shook the toes,\nangrily, as if they were to blame for the condition of things; and thus\nresting all her weight upon her left foot that, likewise, mutinied and\nsent a thrill of torture through its entire length. Did white shoes\nalways act that way?\n\nShe stopped short and addressed the misbehaving members in her sternest\ntones:\n\n\"What's the matter with you to make you hurt so? Never before has a new\nshoe done it; I've just put them on and walked out of the store as\ncomfortably as if they were old ones. Hmm! I guess it's all imagination.\nThey aren't quite, not _quite_ so big as my old ones were, but they fit\nex-quis-ite-ly! Ouch!\"\n\n\"Excruciatingly\" would have been the better word, as Dorothy presently\nrealized; but, also, came the happy thought that she had \"saved\" enough\nmoney on her purchases to pay her car-fare home. She knew that mother\nMartha would consider her extravagant to ride when she had no market\nbasket to carry but--Whew! Ride she must! That pain, it began to make\nher feel positively ill! Also, it rendered her entrance of the car a\ndifficult matter; so that, instead of the light spring up the step she\nwas accustomed to give, she tottered like an old woman and was most\ngrateful for the conductor's help as he pulled her in. She sank into the\ncorner seat with a look of agony on her pretty face and her aching toes\nthrust straight out before her, in a vain seeking for relief; nor did it\nadd to her composure to see the glances of others in the car follow hers\nto the projecting feet while a smile touched more faces than one.\n\nPoor Dorothy never forgot her first purchase, \"all alone\"; and her\nvanity received a pretty severe lesson that day. So severe that as she\nfinally limped to the steps of No. 77 she sat down on the bottom one,\nunable to ascend them till she had removed her shoes. The misery which\nfollowed this act was, at first, so overpowering that she closed her\neyes, the better to endure it; and when she opened them again there\nstood a man before her, looking at her so sharply that she was\nfrightened; and who, when she would have risen, stopped her by a gesture\nand a smile that were even more alarming than his stare.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" demanded the little girl, suddenly realizing that in\nthis broad daylight, upon an open street, nobody would dare to hurt her.\n\nThe stranger's unlovely smile deepened into a gruff laughter, as he\nanswered:\n\n\"Humph! You don't appear to know me. But I know you. I know you better\nthan the folks who've brought you up. I can help you to a great fortune\nif you'll let me. Hey?\"\n\n\"You--can? Oh! how!\" cried Dorothy, springing up, and in her amazement\nat this statement forgetting her aching feet. \"A fortune!\" And that was\nthe very thing that father John now needed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nDOROTHY ENTERTAINS\n\n\nDorothy's punishment for her unwise purchase was to wear the white shoes\ncontinually. This was only possible by slitting their tops in various\nplaces, which not only spoiled their beauty but was a constant \"lecture\"\nto their wearer; who remarked:\n\n\"One thing, mother Martha, I've learned by 'shopping'--the vanity of\nvanity! I've always longed for pretty things, but--call _them_ pretty?\nDoesn't matter though, does it? if we're really going to move and\neverything to be so changed. When we live in the country may I have all\nthe flowers I want?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the matron, absently. Although this was Sunday, a day on\nwhich she faithfully tried to keep her mind free from weekday cares, she\ncould not banish them now. Instead of going to church she was to visit\nthe hospital and spend the morning with her husband. Dorothy was to\nattend Sunday school, as usual, wearing the slitted shoes, for the\nsimple reason that she now possessed no others. Afterward, she might\ninvite Mabel Bruce to stay with her, and they were to keep house till\nits mistress's return.\n\n\"I hope you'll have a very happy day, dear. After I leave John, though I\nshall stay with him as long as I am allowed, I must go to see Aunt\nChloe. There'll be no time for visits during the week, and besides,\nshe'll want to hear about everything at first hand. Poor old creature!\nIt'll be hard for her to part with her 'boy' and I mustn't neglect her.\nYou needn't cook any dinner, for there's a good, cold lunch. I made a\nnice custard pie for you, last night, after you were asleep. There's\nplenty of bread and butter, an extra bottle of milk, and you may cut a\nfew thin slices of the boiled ham. Be sure to do it carefully, for we\nwill have to live upon it for as long as possible. If you tell Mrs.\nBruce that the invitation is from me I think she'll let Mabel come.\nDon't leave the house without locking up tight, and after you come back\nfrom Sunday school don't leave it at all. Have you learned your lesson?\nAlready? My! but you are quick at your books! Good-bye. I hope you'll\nhave a happy day, and you may expect me sometime in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"But, mother, wait! There's a cluster of my fairy-roses out in bloom and\nI want to send them to father. A deep red sort that hasn't blossomed\nbefore and that we've been watching so long. I'll fill it with kisses,\ntell him, and almost want to get half-sick again, myself, to be back in\nhospital with him. Aren't you going to take him any of that nice ham?\nYou know he loves it so.\"\n\n\"No, dear. I was specially told not to bring food. The nurses will give\nhim all he needs and that's better for him than anything we outside\nfolks could fix. Afterwards--Well, let us hope we shall still have\ndecent stuff to eat! Now I'm off. Good-bye. Be careful and don't get\ninto any sort of foolishness. Good-bye.\"\n\nDorothy gazed after her mother as she disappeared and felt a strange\ndesire to call her back, or beg to go with her. The house was so empty\nand desolate without the cheerful presence of the postman. Their Sunday\nmornings had used to be so happy. Then he was at liberty to walk with\nher in the park near-by, if it were cold weather; or if the lovely\nseason for gardening, as now they repaired to the little back yard which\ntheir united labors had made to \"blossom like the rose.\"\n\nJohn Chester had bought No. 77 Brown Street. It was not yet much more\nthan half paid for, but he considered it his. Martha was the most\nprudent of housekeepers and could make a little money go a long way; so\nthat, even though his salary was small, they managed each month to lay\naside a few dollars toward reducing the mortgage which still remained on\nthe property. But he had not waited to be wholly out of debt to begin\nhis improvements, and the first of these had been to turn the bare\nground behind the house into a charming garden. Not an inch of the\nspace, save that required for paths and a tiny shed for ash and garbage\ncans, was left untilled; and as Baltimore markets afford most beautiful\nplants at low rates he had gathered a fine collection. Better than\nthat, there were stables at the rear, instead of the negro-alleys which\nintersect so many of the city blocks, and from these he not only\nobtained extra soil but stirred his stable friends to emulate his\nindustry. Vines and ivies had been planted on the stable walls as well\nas on his own back fence, so that, instead of looking out upon ugly\nbrick and whitewash, the neighbors felt that they possessed a sort of\nprivate park behind their dwellings, and all considered father John a\npublic benefactor and rejoiced in the results of his efforts. Many of\nthem, too, were stirred--like the stable-men--to attempt some gardening\non their own account, and this was not only good for them but made the\none-hundred-block of Brown Street quite famous in the town.\n\nDorothy had visited the garden that morning before breakfast and had\nfound the new roses which were the latest addition to their stock. She\nhad also shed a few tears over them, realizing that he who had planted\nthem would watch them no more.\n\n\"Dear little 'fairies'! seems if you just blossom for nothing, now!\"\nshe had said to them, then had resolved that they should go to him since\nhe could not come to them; and, having cut them, she fled the garden,\nmissing him more there than anywhere.\n\nOnce Dorothy C. would have been ashamed to appear among her classmates,\nin their Sunday attire, wearing her slitted shoes; but to-day her mind\nwas full of other, far more important, matters. So she bore their\nraillery with good nature, laughed by way of answer, and was so\nimpatient to be at home, where she could discuss all with her chum, that\nshe could hardly wait to obtain Mrs. Bruce's consent to the visit. So,\nas soon as the two girls were cozily settled in the little parlor, she\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Mabel Bruce! I've something perfectly wonderful to tell you. Do you\nknow--_I'm an_--_heiress_!\"\n\n\"No. I don't know, nor you either,\" returned Mabel, coolly; rocking her\nplump body to and fro in the postman's own chair, and complacently\nsmoothing her ruffles. Then she leaned forward, glanced from her own\nfeet to Dorothy's, and carefully dusted her white shoes with her\nhandkerchief.\n\nThe little hostess laughed, but remarked, a trifle tartly:\n\n\"That's what I call nasty-nice. Next time you'll be wiping your nose on\nthat same thing and I'd rather have the dust on my shoes than in my\nnostrils. But no matter. I've so many things to tell you I don't know\nwhere to begin!\"\n\n\"Don't you? Well, then, you're such a terrible talker when you get\nstarted, s'pose we have our dinner first. I'm terrible hungry.\"\n\n\"Hungry, Mabel Bruce? Already? Didn't you have your breakfast?\"\n\n\"Course, I did. But a girl can't eat once and make it last all day, can\nshe?\"\n\n\"I reckon _you_ can't. You're the greatest eater I ever did see. All the\ngirls say so. That's why you're always put on the refreshment committee\nat our picnics. Even Miss Georgia says: 'If you want to be sure of\nenough provision make Mabel chairman.' A chairman is the boss of any\nparticular thing, if you don't know:\" instructed this extremely frank\nhostess.\n\n\"Oh! course I know. You just said I was one and folks most gen'ally know\nwhat they are themselves, I guess,\" answered the plumber's daughter,\nwithout resentment. What anybody _said_ didn't matter to phlegmatic\nMabel so long as their _doing_ agreed with her desires. She was fond of\nDorothy C. Oh! yes, she was sincerely fond as well as proud! The\nChesters were bringing up their daughter very nicely, her mother\ndeclared, and that Dorothy had the prettiest manners of all the girls\nwho came to their house. Mabel had her own opinion of those manners, of\nwhich she had just had a specimen, but she never contradicted her mother\nand not often her playmates. As a rule she was too lazy, and was only\nmoved to dispute a statement when it was really beyond belief--like that\nof her chum's having suddenly become an \"heiress.\" Heiresses were rich.\nMabel wasn't very wise but she knew that, and witness Dorothy's ragged\nshoes. Heiress? Huh! It was more sensible to return to the subject of\ndinner, for the visitor had sampled Mrs. Chester's cooking before now\nand knew it to be excellent. So she rose and started for the kitchen,\nand with an exclamation of regret the hostess followed the guest, though\ncautioning her:\n\n\"If we eat our lunch now, at a little after eleven o'clock, you mustn't\nexpect another dinner at one. My mother didn't say I could have two\nmeals, so you better eat dreadful slow and make it last.\"\n\n\"All right. I will. Maybe, too, I'll go home by our own dinner time.\nSundays, that isn't till after two o'clock, 'cause my mother goes to\nchurch and has to cook it afterward. Sunday is the only day my father is\nhome to dinner, so he wants a big one and mother gets it for him. Your\nfather's home Sundays, too, isn't he?\"\n\n\"He--he was--He used----\" began Dorothy, then with a sudden burst of\ntears turned away and hid her face in her hands.\n\nWarm-hearted, if always-hungry, Mabel instantly threw her arms about her\nfriend's waist and tried to comfort her with loving kisses and the\nassurance:\n\n\"He will be again, girlie. Don't you worry. Folks go to hospitals all\nthe time and come back out of them. My father, he had the typhoid fever,\nlast year, and he went. Don't you remember? and how nice all the\nneighbors were to me and ma. And now he's as strong--as strong! So'll\nyour father be, too, and go whistling round the block just like he used\nto did. Don't cry, Dorothy C. It makes your eyes all funny and--and\nbesides, if you don't stop I'll be crying myself, in a minute, and I\ndon't want to. _I_ look perfectly horrid when I cry, I get so red and\npuffy, and I shouldn't like to cry on this dress. It's just been done up\nand ma says I've got to keep it clean enough to wear four Sundays, it's\nsuch a job to iron all the ruffles.\"\n\nDespite her loneliness Dorothy laughed. There was a deal of\nconsideration for herself in Mabel's remarks, yet her sympathy was\nsincere as her affection long-proved. She had been the first playmate of\nthe little foundling, and it was her belief--gathered from that of her\nparents--that the Chesters' adopted child would turn out to be of good\nbirth, if ever the truth were known. In any case, she was the prettiest\nand cleverest girl in school, and Mabel was proud to be the one selected\nthis morning as a companion.\n\n\"O you funny Mabel!\" cried Dorothy. \"You're sorry for both of us, aren't\nyou! Well, come along. We started to get lunch and to talk. You go to\nthe ice-box and get the things, while I set the table. Wait! Put on my\ntie-before, to keep your dress clean. Good thing your sleeves are short.\nArms'll wash easier than ruffles. Hurry up--you to eat and I to talk.\"\n\nVery shortly they were engaged in these congenial matters, though Mabel\nalmost forgot that she was hungry in her astonishment at Dorothy's\nopening statement:\n\n\"We're going to move. I guess this is about the last time you'll ever\ncome to this house to dinner.\"\n\n\"Going--to--move!\" ejaculated Mabel, with her mouth so full of pie that\nshe could hardly speak.\n\n\"Yes. We've got to pack up this very week.\"\n\n\"Where to? Who's going to live here? Who told you? Why?\" demanded Mabel,\nhastening to get in as many questions as she could, during the interval\nof arranging a sandwich for herself.\n\n\"I don't--know! Why I never thought to ask, but I know it's true because\nit was my mother told me. 'Into the country,' she said, 'cause the\nhospital folks say that's the only thing for my father to do if he wants\nto get well. And of course he wants. We all want, more than anything\nelse in the world. So, that's why, and that's the first piece of news.\nAnd say, Mabel, maybe your folks'll let you come and see me sometimes.\nThat is, if my folks ask you,\" she added, with cautious afterthought.\n\n\"Maybe! Wouldn't that be just lovely? We'd go driving in a little\nT-cart, all by ourselves, with a dear little pony to haul us, and--and\npeaches and plums and strawberries and blackberries--Um!\" exclaimed the\nprospective guest, compressing her lips as if she were already tasting\nthese delights.\n\n\"I--don't--know. Perhaps, we would. If we had the pony, and the cart,\nand were let. That's a lot of 'ifs' to settle first.\"\n\n\"Why, of course. I was in the country once, two whole weeks. It was to a\nbig house where my father was putting the plumbing in order for the\nfamily and the family had gone away while he was doing it. It was there\nhe got the typhoid fever, and they went away because they didn't want to\nget it. They left some 'coons' to do the cooking and told my father he\ncould bring me and ma, and we could have a vacation in a cottage on the\nplace. So we did; and the man, the colored one, that took care of the\nhorses used to hitch the pony up to the T-cart and me and ma rode out\nevery day. Course, if you live in the country you'll have to have a\npony. How else'd you go around? There wasn't any street cars to that\ncountry, 'at ever I saw, and folks can't walk all the roads there are.\nPooh! You see, I've been and you haven't, and that's the difference.\"\n\n\"Yes, you've been and I haven't, but, Mabel Bruce, I know more about\nthings that grow than you do, for I know--even in Lexington Market--you\ndon't get strawberries and peaches at the same time. So you needn't\nexpect all those good things when you come. You'll have to put up with\npart at a time, with whatever happens to be in our garden. If we have a\ngarden! And as for ponies, our house in the country won't be a big one,\nlike yours was, that much I know, too. We haven't any money, hardly. My\nmother Martha was crying about that yesterday, though she didn't know I\nsaw her till I asked and after I'd spent all those two dollars for these\nsilly shoes. Mabel Bruce, don't you ever go buy shoes too small for you.\nUmm. I tell you if you do your feet'll hurt you worse than my head did\nafter I banged it--the dog banged it--on Mrs. Cecil's stoop. Isn't she a\nfunny old woman? My father thinks she is the wisest one he knows, but\nI--I--Well, it doesn't count what I think. Only if I was as rich as she,\nand I expect I will be sometime, I wouldn't keep Great Dane dogs to jump\non little girls like she does. Have some more ham, Mabel?\"\n\nThe mere thought of her prospective wealth had increased Dorothy's\nhospitality--at her mother's expense: but to her surprise her guest\nreplied:\n\n\"No--I guess--I guess I can't. Not 'less you've got some mustard mixed\nsomewhere, to eat on it. I've et----\"\n\n\"Eaten,\" corrected her classmate, who was considered an expert in\ngrammar.\n\n\"Et-ten about all I can hold without--without mustard, to sort of season\nit. Ma always has mustard to put on her ham; and yours is--is getting\nsort of--bitter,\" replied Mabel, leaning back in her chair. She always\nate rapidly--\"stuffed,\" as her father reproved her--and to-day she had\noutdone herself. The food was delicious. Mrs. Chester was too thrifty a\nhousewife ever to \"spoil\" anything, no matter how inexpensive a dish,\nand in her judgment, boiled ham was a luxury, to be partaken of\nsparingly and with due appreciation, never \"gobbled.\"\n\nTherefore it was with positive consternation that Dorothy's thoughts\ncame back to practical things and to the joint which she had placed\nbefore her guest, allowing her to carve. Though she had herself barely\ntasted the morsel placed upon her own plate, being too much engaged in\ntalking, she now perceived that Mabel had done more than justice to her\nlunch. So it was with a cry of real distress that she snatched the dish\nfrom the table, exclaiming:\n\n\"Well, I guess you don't need mustard to sharpen your appetite, you\ngreedy thing! Beg pardon. That was a nasty thing to say to--to company,\nand I'm sorry I said it. But mother told me we had to live on that ham\nmost the week, she'd be so much too busy to cook and--Why, Mabel Bruce!\nYou've eaten almost half that pie, too! Hmm. I guess you can stay\ncontented the rest the day. You won't need to go home to your\ntwo-o'clock dinner!\"\n\nNo offense was intended or received. These two small maids had been\naccustomed, from infancy, to utter frankness with one another, and with\nperfect amiability the guest replied:\n\n\"Maybe I do eat a little too much. Ma thinks I do, sometimes, and pa\nsays that's the reason I'm so fat. I'd rather not be fat. I'd like to be\nas slim as you are, Dorothy C. Ma says you've got such a pretty figure\n't you look nice in anything. Well, I guess since I've got to keep my\ndress so clean for so long, I won't offer to help do the dishes. I'll go\nsit in the parlor and take care of the front of the house.\"\n\nWith that Miss Mabel took off her friend's \"tie-before,\" a big gingham\napron which covered all her skirts, and hung it on its nail, then\nretreated to the postman's rocker, at perfect peace with herself and all\nthe world.\n\nNot so Dorothy C. She looked after her chum with a contempt that was as\nnew as it was uncomfortable. She had promised herself a real treat in\ndiscussing her own affairs--for the first time in her life become\nimportant ones--with this reliable confidante, but now she was bitterly\ndisappointed. \"Mabel is selfish, but Mabel is truthful. She never speaks\nill of another and she always keeps her word:\" had been Miss Georgia's\ndecision once, when some class matters had gone wrong and the plumber's\ndaughter had been accused of \"tattling.\" To this Dorothy now added: \"And\nMabel is a regular, gluttonous simpleton. She isn't really interested\nin anybody except--Mabel!\"\n\nWith this uncharitable sentiment, the little hostess proceeded to clear\naway; and did this with so much vim that she dropped a tumbler and broke\nit. This was sufficient to calm her anger and turn what was left of it\nagainst her own carelessness, anticipating her mother's reproof. She\nfinished her task very quietly, now, and then repaired to the parlor,\nwhere she found Mabel had fallen asleep in the rocker.\n\nAlso, at that moment, there sauntered past the windows a man who peered\nthrough them with considerable curiosity: and who at sight of Dorothy C.\nstopped sauntering, lifted his eyebrows questioningly, and, turning\naround, walked back to the steps.\n\nDorothy's heart almost choked her, it so suddenly began to beat\nviolently, while a chill ran through her whole body, and made her recall\na saying of old Aunt Chloe that \"when a body turns all goose-flesh it's\na sign somebody is walking over her, or his, grave.\" Father John laughed\nat this superstition as he did at many another of the dear old aunt who\nhad \"raised\" him, an orphan; and had he been present Dorothy would have\nlaughed with him. But she didn't laugh now; though she was presently\ncalm enough to review the situation and to decide that none could be\nbetter. Also, that she must, at once, get rid of Mabel Bruce. For this\nwas the same man who had appeared before her, on the previous morning,\nand had, at first startled, then profoundly interested her. He had\nimposed secrecy upon her; at least secrecy as far as her parents were\nconcerned, though she had meant to tell Mabel all that he had told her.\nShe didn't like secrets. She hated them! Yet if they were to benefit\nthose whom she loved better than herself she was willing to keep\nthem--for a time.\n\nIn another moment she had roused her visitor by a strong shake of the\npretty, plump shoulder under the lace-trimmed frock, and had said,\nrather loudly:\n\n\"Mabel, if you're going home to dinner, you'd better go now.\nBecause--because I have some business to attend to, and I shall have to\nsee the gentleman alone.\"\n\nShe felt that though her words might be rude--she wouldn't like to be\nsent home, herself, from a visit--yet her manner was beautifully\ngrown-up and dignified; and, as Mabel obediently vanished, \"Miss\nChester\" bade the gentleman waiting outside to enter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDOROTHY GOES UPON AN ERRAND\n\n\nWhen Mrs. Chester returned she was tired and found Dorothy so. The girl\ntook her mother's hat and put it away in its box, brought her a fan, and\nasked if she should get her something to eat.\n\n\"No, dear, thank you. I had dinner, all I wanted, with Aunt Chloe\nChester. She takes this trouble of ours very hard, and declares that she\nwill not live to see 'her boy' come back to Baltimore. She wishes she\ncould die first, right away, so 'that he could go to my funeral while\nhe's handy to it.'\"\n\n\"Horrors! I--I suppose I love Aunt Chloe, because she was so good to\nfather John, but I hope I'll never grow into such a terrible old woman.\nSeems if she had always to be dragged up out of the gloom into the\nsunshine. It's always the worst things are going to happen--with her. I\ndon't see how father ever grew up to be such a sunshiny man, always\nunder her hand, so. You must have had a dreary visit.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a restful one; but the reason for John's always looking on\nthe bright side may be just that she always did the opposite. But you\nlook sober, too, dearie. Wasn't Mabel's visit a pleasant one? How long\nhas she been gone?\"\n\n\"Oh! a good while. She went home to dinner. I--she ate 'most all the\nham. All the best big slices anyway, and full half the pie. Then she\nwanted mustard, so she could eat more. She said that sometimes when she\ncouldn't eat a big lot and they had extra good things, she'd get up and\nwalk around the table, so she could. She didn't say that, to-day,\nthough, but did once at a school picnic. And I--I broke a tumbler. One\nof the best.\"\n\n\"Why, Dorothy C.! How could you?\" returned Mrs. Chester, but not at all\nas if she really heard or were in the least vexed. Then, as if forcing\nherself to an interest in small, home matters, she asked: \"Were you\nvery lonely after she went?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. I wasn't alone--I mean, I wasn't lonely. Did father like\nhis roses?\"\n\n\"Yes, darling, and he fully appreciated your cutting them. He said he\nknew how you disliked it, for you'd never got over your baby notion that\nit hurt the plants, just as a cut finger hurt you. He said, too, that I\nwas to tell you he'd found all the kisses, every one, but if you wanted\nany paid back you'd have to come to Johns Hopkins after them. It was a\ncomfort to find him so happy and sure of getting well. I wish I were\nhalf as sure!\"\n\nDorothy opened her lips to say something which it seemed impossible to\nkeep from this beloved little mother opposite, who already seemed so\nchanged and worn; who had lost every bit of that gayety which had been\nso astonishing, yesterday. But not yet--not yet. Besides, she was fully\nas truthful as Mabel Bruce and had given her pledge to silence. Then she\nremembered that she did not know to what part of the \"country\" they were\ndestined, and asked:\n\n\"Mother Martha, can't you tell me something of your plans? Where we are\ngoing and when? And what is to become of this dear home?\"\n\nThere was so much earnestness and sympathy in the girl's tones that Mrs.\nChester forgot how young she was, and now talked with her as she might\nhave done with a much older person; almost, indeed, as she would have\ndone with the postman himself.\n\n\"We are going to a far-away state; to a place I haven't seen since I was\na child, myself--the Hudson River highlands.\"\n\n\"Why--the Hudson River is in New York and we're in Maryland!\" cried\nDorothy. \"Why go so far, away from everybody we know and care for?\nWouldn't it do just to go to some little spot right near Baltimore,\nwhere we could come into the city on the cars, at any time? Isn't that\nwhat the Johns Hopkins doctors call the 'country'?\"\n\n\"Oh! if we only might! But, my dear, there's an old saying about\n'beggars' being 'choosers.' We aren't beggars, of course, but we are too\npoor to be 'choosers.' Fortunately, or unfortunately, as time will\nprove, I have a little place in the country where I told you. It\nbelonged to an old bachelor uncle who died long ago. It has stood empty\nfor many years and may be badly out of order. He willed it to me, as my\nportion of his estate: and though some of his other heirs have once or\ntwice offered to buy it from me, the price they offered was so small\nthat John had me refuse it. He's said in jest: 'No telling how glad we\nmay some time be of that rocky hill-farm, Martha. Better hold on to it,\nas long as we can pay the taxes and keep it.' The taxes were not heavy,\nand we've paid them. Now, it is the only place out of the city where we\nhave a right to go; and in one sense there couldn't be a better. It's\none of the healthiest spots on earth, I suppose: and there'll be plenty\nof room for John to live in 'the open,' as he's advised. So we must go;\"\nand with a heavy sigh mother Martha ceased speaking and leaned her head\nback, closing her eyes as if she were about to sleep.\n\nBut underneath all her calmness of tone had lain a profound sadness, and\nnone but the absent John could have told how bitter to her was the\ncoming severance from all she had ever held dear. Though born in New\nYork State, she had come south with her parents when she was too small\nto remember any other home than their humble one in this same city. Here\nshe had met and married John. Here they had together earned their cozy\nhome. Here were all her church associations, and here the few whom she\ncalled friends.\n\nShe had always leaned upon her husband's greater wisdom and strength in\nall the affairs of their quiet lives, and now that she needed them most\nshe was deprived of them. Alone, she must pack up, or sell, their\nhousehold goods, and not an article of them but was dear because of some\nsacrifice involved in its purchase. Alone, she must attend to the sale\nor rental of their house, for the doctors had told her that very morning\nthat her patient must not be disturbed \"for any cause whatever. There\nwas a chance, one in a thousand, that he might get well. If this chance\nwere to be his it depended upon his absolute freedom from care and\nresponsibility.\"\n\nShe had assured them that this should be so, and it had seemed easy to\npromise, in the face of the greater sorrow if he must remain an invalid\nor, possibly, die. But now, back in the security of her beloved home,\nher courage waned; and Dorothy, watching, saw tears steal from under the\nclosed eyelids and chase one another down the pale cheek, which only\nyesterday, it seemed, had been so round and rosy.\n\nTo a loving child there is no more piteous sight than a mother weeping.\nIt was more than Dorothy could bear, and, with a little cry of distress,\nshe threw herself at Mrs. Chester's knees and hid her own wet eyes upon\nthem. Then she lifted her head and begged:\n\n\"Don't cry, mother! Dearest mother Martha, please, please, don't cry!\nYou've never done it, never; in all my life I haven't seen you, no\nmatter what happened. If you cry we can't do anything, and I'm going to\nhelp you. Maybe we won't have to go away. Maybe something perfectly\nsplendid will happen to prevent. Maybe darling father will get well,\njust resting from his mail route. Surely, nobody could fix him nicer\nnourishments than you can, if we can afford it. Maybe we shall be able\nto afford--Oh! if only I could tell you something! Something that would\nmake you happy again!\"\n\nMother Martha ceased weeping and smiled into the tender eyes of the\ndevoted child who had so well repaid her own generosity. Then she wiped\nboth their faces and in quite a matter-of-fact way bade Dorothy sit\ndown, quietly, while she told her some necessary things. One: that in\nthe morning she should be sent to the post-office, to receive the\nenvelope containing the ten dollars due for her own board. Mrs. Chester\nhad arranged with the new postman about it and there would be no\ndifficulty. There was never a word written with these payments. The\npostman's address was on the outside the envelope, which was never\nregistered, had never gone astray, and had never held more than the\nsolitary crisp ten-dollar bill expected.\n\n\"We shall need all the money we can get in hand, for the expenses of our\nmoving will be heavy--for us. I'm going to see some real-estate men and\ndecide whether it is best to sell, or rent, this house. I shall be very\nbusy. John isn't to stay at the hospital but a week, and so by the end\nof this coming one I want to be in our new home. I rather dread the\njourney, though we can easily make it in a day--or less. But your father\nthinks he can get along real well on crutches, that we'll have to buy,\nof course; and I've noticed that people on the street cars, even, are\nalways kind and helpful to invalids. John believes that it's a good,\njolly old world, and you and I must try to believe the same. He says\nthere's lots of truth in the saying: 'He that would have friends must\nshow himself friendly.' I reckon nobody ever turned a friendlier face\ntoward others than John has, and that's why everybody loves him so.\n\n\"Now, dearie, fetch me my Bible and I'll read awhile. I don't feel as if\nI'd had any real Sunday, yet. Then, by and by, you may make me a cup of\ntea and we'll get to bed early. Of course, there'll be no more school\nfor you here, though I shall want you to step in and bid Miss Georgia\ngood-bye. That's no more than polite, even if you don't love her as you\nshould.\"\n\nDorothy made a little mouth, which for once her mother did not reprove:\nand presently they both were reading. At least, Mrs. Chester really was,\nwhile the peace of the volume she studied stole into her troubled heart\nand shed its light upon her face. Dorothy, also, held her book in her\nhand and kept her eyes fixed on the printed pages; but, had her mother\nchanced to look up and observe, she would have seen no leaves turned;\nthough gradually an expression of almost wild delight grew upon the\nmobile features till the girl looked as if she were just ready to sing.\n\nHowever, she said nothing of her happy thoughts and watched her mother\nfall asleep in the drowsy heat of the late afternoon, and from the\nfatigue of a sleepless night and a busy day. Then she crept on tiptoe\nout of the room, noiselessly removing her slitted shoes before she rose\nfrom her chair, and presently had gained the kitchen at the rear. Here\nshe lighted a little gas stove and put on the kettle to boil. Then she\ndid what seemed a strange thing for a girl as strictly reared as she,\non a Sunday evening. She caught up her short skirts and, after the\nmanner of pictured dancers upon wall-posters, began to whirl and\npirouette around the little space, as if by such movements, only, could\nshe express the rapture that thrilled her.\n\n\"There, I reckon I've worked myself down to quiet!\" she exclaimed, at\nlength, to the cat which entered, stretching its legs in a sleepy\nfashion and ready for its supper. \"Now, I'll feed you, Ma'am Puss,\nthough you ought to feed yourself on the rats that bother our garden.\nQueer, isn't it? How everything 'feeds' on something else. I hate rats,\nand I hate to have them killed. Killing is horrible: and, I'm afraid\nthat to have my roses killed by the creatures is worst of all.\"\n\nMa'am Puss did not reply, except by rubbing herself against her\nmistress's legs, and, having filled a saucer with milk, Dorothy went out\ninto the garden and stayed there a long time. There many thoughts came\nto her, and many, many regrets. Regrets for past negligencies, that had\ncaused the drooping--therefore suffering--of some tender plant; for the\nknowledge of her coming separation from these treasures which both she\nand father John had loved almost as if they were human creatures; but\nkeenest of all, regrets for the lost activity of the once so active\npostman. Mother Martha's griefs and her own might be hard to bear, but\nhis was far, far worse. Nothing, not even the delightful surprises she\nfelt she had in store for him, could give him back his lost health.\n\nShe had no propensity to dance when she went indoors again. It was a\nvery sober, thoughtful Dorothy C. who presently carried a little tray\ninto the parlor and insisted upon the tired housemistress enjoying her\nsupper there, where she could look out upon the cheerful street with its\nSunday promenaders, \"and just be waited on, nice and cozy.\"\n\nBoth inmates of the little home slept soundly that night. Sleep is a\nclose friend to the toilers of the world, though the idle rich seek it\nin vain: and the morning found them refreshed and courageous for the\nduties awaiting. There would be few tears and no repining on the part of\neither because of a home-breaking. Bitterer trials might come, but the\ndepth of this one they had fathomed and put behind them.\n\nMoreover, it fell in with Dorothy's own desires that she was to make the\npost-office trip: and she started upon it with so much confidence that\nher mother was surprised and remarked:\n\n\"Well, small daughter, for a child who knows so little of business and\nhas never been further down town than the market, alone, you are\nbehaving beautifully. I'm proud of you. So will your father be. Maybe,\nif any of the agents I'm going to telephone come here to-day and keep\nme, I'll let you go to pay the daily visit to John and tell him all the\nnews. Take care of the street crossings. It's so crowded on the business\nstreets and I should be forlorn, indeed, if harm befell my Dorothy C.\"\n\nEven when the child turned, half-way down the block, to toss a kiss\nbackward to her mother in the doorway, that anxious woman felt a strange\nfear for her darling and recalled her for a final caution:\n\n\"Be sure to take care of your car-fare, Dorothy; and be more than sure\nyou don't lose the money-letter. When you board a car look to see\nanother isn't coming on the other track, to knock you down.\"\n\nThe little girl came back and clung to Mrs. Chester for a moment,\nlaughing, yet feeling her own courage a trifle dashed by these\nsuggestions of peril. But she slipped away again, determining to do her\nerrands promptly, while, with a curious foreboding in her mind, the\nhousemistress re-entered her deserted home, reflecting:\n\n\"John always laughs at my 'presentiments,' yet I never had one as strong\nas this upon me now that I did not wish, afterward, I had yielded to it.\nI've half a mind to follow the child and overtake her before she gets\ninto a car. I could snatch a little while to do those downtown errands\nand she'd be perfectly safe here. Pshaw! How silly I am! Dorothy is old\nenough to be trusted and can be. I'll put her out of mind till I hear\nher gay little call at the door, when she rings its bell: 'It's I,\nmother Martha! Please let me in!'\"\n\nBut alas! That familiar summons was never again to be heard at No. 77\nBrown Street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAN OFFICE SEEKER AND A CLIENT\n\n\n\"Well, little girl, what are you doing here?\"\n\nDorothy had safely reached the big post-office, which seemed to be the\nbusiest place she had ever entered; busier even than the department\nstores on a \"bargain day;\" and she had timidly slipped into the quietest\ncorner she could find, to wait a moment while the crowd thinned. Then\nshe would present her note, that asked for father John's letter to be\ngiven her, and which was in his own handwriting, to make sure. But the\ncrowd did not thin! Besides the swarms and swarms of postmen, wearing\njust such gray uniforms as her father's, there were so many men. All\nwere hastening to or from the various windows which partitioned a big\ninner room from this bigger outside one and behind which were other men\nin uniform--all so busy, busy, busy!\n\n\"Why! I didn't dream there could ever be so many letter-carriers! and\neach one is so like father, that I'm all mixed up! I know I've got to go\nto one those windows, to give this letter and get the other one, but how\nwill I ever get a chance to do it, between all those men?\"\n\nThen while Dorothy thus wondered, growing half-frightened, there had\ncome that question, put in a familiar tone, and looking up she saw\nanother gray-uniformed person whom she recognized as her father's\nfriend. Once he had been to their house to dinner, and how glad she now\nwas for that.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Lathrop! How glad I am to see you! I've got to get a letter and\nI don't see how I'll ever have the chance. The people don't stop coming,\nnot a minute.\"\n\n\"That's so, little girl--Beg pardon, but I forget your name, though I\nknow you belong to John Chester.\"\n\n\"Dorothy it is, Mr. Lathrop. Could you--could you possibly spare time to\nhelp me?\"\n\n\"Well, I reckon there's nobody in this office but would spare any\namount of time to help one of John Chester's folks. I was just starting\non my rounds--second delivery--heavy mail--but come along with me and\nI'll fix you out all right.\"\n\nHe turned, shifted his heavy pouch a little, and caught her hand. Then\nhe threaded his way through the crowd with what seemed to his small\ncompanion a marvelous dexterity. It happened to be the \"rush hour\" of\nbusiness, and at almost any other, Dorothy would not have found any\ndifficulty in making her own way around, but there was also the\nconfusion of a first visit. Presently, however, she found herself at the\nright window to secure the letter she sought, received it, and heard Mr.\nLathrop say:\n\n\"There. That's all right. I reckon you can find your way out all safe,\nand I'm in a hurry. Please make my regards to your mother and tell her\nwe've heard where John is and some of us are going to see him, first\nchance we get. Too bad such a thing should happen to him! Don't let\nanybody snatch that letter from you, and good-bye.\"\n\nThen Dorothy found herself alone and no longer afraid. She had\naccomplished her mother's errand--now she must attend to a much more\nimportant one of her own. She gazed about her with keenest interest,\ntrying to understand the entire postal business, as there represented\nbefore her, and assuring herself that after all it was extremely simple.\n\n\"It's just because it's new. New things always puzzle folks. As soon as\nI've been once or twice I shan't mind it, no more than any of these\npeople do. I wonder which way I must go? If he's the head man he ought\nto have the head room, I should think. Hmm. I'll have to ask,\nand--and--I sort of hate to. Never mind, Dorothy C.! You're doing it for\nfather John and mother Martha; and if you plan to be grown-up, in your\noutsides, you must be inside, too. Father hates bold little girls. He\nsays they're a--a--annemoly, or something. It belongs to girl children\nto be afraid of things. He thinks it's nice. Well, I'm all right nice\nenough inside, this minute, but--I'll do it!\"\n\nAfter these reflections and this sudden resolution Dorothy darted\nforward and seized the arm of a negro who was cleaning the floor.\n\n\"Please, boy, tell me the way to the head man's place. The real\npostmaster of all.\"\n\n\"Hey? I dunno as he's in, yet. He don't come down soon, o' mornin's.\nWhat you want to see him for?\"\n\n\"On business of my own. The way, please,\" answered Dorothy, bracing her\nresolution by the fancied air of a grown person.\n\nThe negro grinned and resumed his scrubbing, but nodded backward over\nhis shoulder toward a tall gentleman just entering the building.\n\n\"That's him. Now you got your chance, better take it.\"\n\nThere was nothing to inspire fear in the face of this \"head man of all,\"\nnor was there anything left in Dorothy's mind but the desire to\naccomplish her \"business\" at once and, of course, successfully. Another\ninstant, and the gentleman crossing the floor felt a detaining touch\nupon his sleeve and beheld a bonny little face looking earnestly up into\nhis own. Also, a childish voice was saying:\n\n\"I'm John Chester's little girl. May I ask you something?\"\n\n\"You seem already to be asking me something, but I'm happy to meet you,\nMiss Chester, and shall be very glad to hear all about your father. He\nwas one of the very best men on the force, one of the most intelligent.\nI can give you five minutes. Come this way, please.\"\n\nDorothy flashed him one of her beautiful smiles, and the postmaster, who\nhappened to love all children, observed that this was a very handsome\nchild with a pair of wonderful, appealing eyes. Though, of course, he\ndid not express his admiration in words, Dorothy felt that she had\npleased him and her last hesitation vanished.\n\nAs soon as they were seated in a private apartment, she burst into the\nheart of the matter, saying:\n\n\"Please, Mr. Postmaster, will you let me take my father's place?\"\n\n\"W-wh--at?\" asked the gentleman, almost as if he whistled it in\nastonishment.\n\nDorothy laughed. \"I know I'm pretty small to carry big pouches,\n'specially the Christmas and Easter ones, but you always have 'extras'\nthen, anyway. I know my father's whole beat. I know it from end to\nend--all the people's houses, the numbers to them, and lots of the folks\nthat live around. What I don't know I can read on the envelopes. I'm a\nquick reader of handwriting, Miss Georgia says.\"\n\nThe postmaster did not interrupt her by a word, but the twinkle in his\neyes grew brighter and brighter and at the end he laughed. Not harshly\nnor in a manner to hurt her feelings, which he saw were deep and\nsincere, but because he found this one of the most refreshing\nexperiences of his rather humdrum position. Here was a visitor, a\npetitioner, quite different from the numberless illiterate men who\nbothered him for office. He hated to disappoint her, just yet, so asked\nwith interest:\n\n\"And who is Miss Georgia?\"\n\n\"She's my teacher. She's the vice principal of our school. She's\ndreadful smart.\"\n\n\"Indeed? But what, Miss Chester, put this notion into your head? By\ntaking your father's 'place' I conclude that you are applying for his\nposition as mail-carrier. Did you ever hear of a little girl postman?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I didn't, but there has to be a first time, a first one, to\neverything, doesn't there? So I could be the first girl postman. And why\nI want to is because I think I must support my parents.\"\n\nThe applicant's reply was given with the serious importance due from a\nyoung lady whom such a fine gentleman called \"Miss Chester\"; and when he\nagain desired to know whose idea it was that she should seek a place on\n\"the force,\" she answered proudly:\n\n\"All my own. Nobody's else. Not a single body--not even my mother\nMartha--ever suspects. I want it to be a surprise, a real, Christmassy\nsurprise. Oh! She's feeling terrible bad about our leaving our home and\nnot knowing what we'll have to live on. So I thought it all out and that\nI'd come right to you and ask, before any other substitute got\nappointed.\n\n\"Well, maybe the notion came that last day my father carried the mail.\nHis poor legs and feet got so terribly wobbly that he was afraid he'd\nfall down or something and couldn't finish his delivery. So I walked\nalongside of him and ran up the steps and handed in the letters and\neverybody was just as nice as nice to us, except old Mrs. Cecil, who\nlives at Bellevieu. She was mad. She was real mad. She said we were\nbreaking the law, the two of us. Think of that! My father, John Chester,\na law-breaker! Why, he couldn't break a law to save his life. He's too\ngood.\"\n\nThe postmaster smiled. He had, apparently, forgotten that he was to give\nonly five minutes to this small maid, and he was really charmed by her\nsimplicity and confidence.\n\n\"Was that the day Mr. Chester was taken to the hospital? The boys have\ntold me about him--some things. How is he doing? Will he be there long?\nYou see, I can ask questions, too!\" continued the gentleman, very\nsocially.\n\n\"My mother says there's a chance he may get well. He's to be there only\nthis week that ever is. Then he's to be taken into the country, away,\naway to some mountains in New York State. He's got to live right\noutdoors all the time, and he mustn't worry, not a single worry. My\nmother daren't even talk with him about selling, or renting, our house,\nor the furniture, or--or anything. So she talks to me--some.\"\n\n\"I hope you talk to her--more than 'some'; and I'm wondering if you had\ndone so before you came to me whether I should ever have had the\npleasure of your acquaintance.\"\n\nWas there a reproof in this? Dorothy's sensitive heart fancied so, yet\nshe couldn't imagine in what she had done wrong. With a little waning of\nhope--the postmaster had been so delightful that she was already sure he\nwould grant her request--she asked:\n\n\"Is it bad? why shouldn't I want to earn the money for my parents? Same\nas they have for me and us all. If I had the place, they could go to the\ncountry, just the same, and the money could be sent to them to live on\nevery month. Of course, I'd have to not go with them. I reckon Mrs.\nBruce, the plumber's wife, would let me live with her, if my folks paid\nher board for me. Mabel and I could sleep together, and I'd help with\nthe dishes and work, 'cause if I were a postman I couldn't go to school,\nof course. I'd have to study nights, same as father has. So, if I didn't\nmake much trouble, maybe Mrs. Bruce wouldn't charge much. But, excuse\nme. My father John says I talk too much, and that when I go to do\nerrands I should stick to business. He says it doesn't make any\ndifference to the folks that hire you to work for them whether you're\nrich or poor, sick or well. All they want is to have the work done--and\nno talk about it. I'm sorry I've said so much. I didn't mean to,\nbut----\"\n\n\"But,\" repeated the postmaster, suggestively; and Dorothy finished her\nsentence:\n\n\"I haven't talked a single word to anybody else, and it seems so good to\ndo it now. I never had a secret--secrets, for I've got another one yet,\nthat I can't tell--before and I don't like them. I beg your pardon,\nand--May I have my father's position?\" said Dorothy, rising, and seeing\nby the big clock on the wall that she had long overstayed the time\nallotted for this interview.\n\nThe gentleman also rose, and laid his hand kindly upon her shoulder, but\nhis face and voice were grave, as he answered:\n\n\"No, my dear, I am sorry to disappoint you, but you ask the impossible.\nYou could not--But there's no use in details of explanation. As your\nwise father has taught you, business should be reduced to its simplest\nterms. I cannot give you the place, but I can, and do, give you the best\nof advice--for one of your imaginative nature. Never cherish secrets!\nNever, even such delightful, surprising ones, as this of yours has been.\nEspecially, never keep anything from your mother. When anything comes\ninto your mind which you feel you cannot tell _her_ banish the idea at\nonce and you'll stay on the safe side of things. Good-morning.\"\n\nOther people were entering the private office and Dorothy was being\ncourteously bowed out of it, before she fully realized that she had not\nobtained her desire, and never would. For a few seconds, her temper\nflamed, and she reflected, tartly:\n\n\"Huh! I should make as good a postman as lots of them do. My father says\nsome of them are too ignorant for their places. _I_'m not ignorant. I'm\nthe best scholar in my class, and my class is the highest one in our\nPrimary. I could do it. I could so. But--Well, he was real nice. He\nacted just as if he had little girls of his own and knew just how they\nfelt. He laughed at me, but he didn't laugh hateful, like Miss Georgia\ndoes on her 'nervous days' when she mixes me all up in my lessons. And\nanyhow, maybe it's just as well. If I'd got to be a letter-girl I\ncouldn't have gone to the country with father and mother, and I should\nhave about died of lonesomeness without them. Maybe Mrs. Bruce wouldn't\nhave had me, nor the minister's folks either. Anyway, I've got that\nother, more splendid secret, still. I _have_ to have that, because I\nhave it already, and so can't help. Miss Georgia would say that there\nwere two too many 'haves' in that sentence, and the 'two too' sounds\nfunny, too. Now I must go home. I've got my money-letter all right and,\nafter all, I'm glad mother Martha doesn't know that I wanted father's\nbeat, she'd be so much disappointed to know how near we came to staying\nhere and couldn't.\"\n\nWith which philosophic acceptance of facts and a cheerful looking\nforward to the \"next thing,\" the rejected seeker after public office ran\nup the hill leading from the post-office and straight against another\nopportunity, as it were.\n\nJust as she had signalled a car, the \"gentleman\" who had twice called\nupon her and who had told her that his name was \"John Smith,\" appeared\nbeside her on the sidewalk, raised his hat, and with an engaging air\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Why, Miss Chester, how fortunate! I was just on the point of going to\nsee you. Now, if you will go with me, instead, it will save time and\nanswer just as well. We don't take this car, but another. My office is\non Howard Street, and we'll walk till we meet a Linden Avenue car. This\nway, please. Allow me?\"\n\nBut Dorothy shrank back from this overly pleasant man. It was with the\nsame feeling of repulsion that she had experienced on each of their\nprevious meetings, and which she had tried to conquer because of the\ngreat benefit he claimed he had sought her to bestow upon her.\n\nHer next sensation was one of pride, remembering that this was the\nsecond time that morning for her to be called \"Miss Chester.\" Each time\nit had been by a grown-up gentleman and the fact made her feel quite\ngrown-up and important, also. Besides, this present person was able, he\nsaid, to more than compensate for any disappointment the postmaster had\ninflicted--though, of course, that affair was known only to \"the head\nman of all\" and herself. However, she couldn't accept Mr. Smith's\ninvitation, for, she explained:\n\n\"Thank you, but I can't go with you now. I'm doing an errand for my\nmother and she'll be expecting me home. She's very busy and needs me to\nhelp her. Nor do I want to make her worry, for she has all the trouble\nnow she can bear. The first time I can come, if you'll tell me where,\nI'll try to do so. Are you sure, sure, Mr. Smith, that I am really an\nheiress and you will help me to get the money that belongs to me?\"\n\n\"Perfectly sure. A lawyer like me doesn't waste his time on any doubtful\nbusiness. I have more cases on hand, this very minute, than I can attend\nto and ought not to stand idle here one moment. Don't, I beg of you,\nalso stand in your own light, against your real interests and the\ninterests of those who are dearer to you than yourself. It is very\nsimple. As soon as you reach the office I'll give you paper and pen and\nyou can send a message to your mother, explaining that you have been\ndetained on business but will soon be with her. Ah, yes, the note by all\nmeans. It quite goes against my nature to cause anybody needless\nanxiety. Here's our car. Step in, please.\"\n\nAs she obeyed Dorothy thought that she had never heard anybody talk as\nfast as the man did. Faster even than she did herself, and with an\nassured air of authority which could not fail to impress an obedient\nchild, trained to accept the decisions of her elders without question.\nShe still tightly clutched the envelope containing the precious\nten-dollar bill, and had so nervously folded and unfolded it that, by\nthe time they reached the place on North Howard Street, it was in such a\nstate she was ashamed of it.\n\n\"Right up stairs, Miss Chester. Sorry I haven't an elevator to assist\nyou,\" remarked the lawyer, curiously regarding her feet in their poor\nshoes. \"However, there are plenty willing to climb three flights of\nstairs for the sake of my advice. I've been in business right here in\nBaltimore longer than I care to remember--it makes me feel so old.\nLawyers who have lovely young clients prefer to remain young themselves,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know. I know nothing about lawyers, anyway, and I don't\nlike it in here. I was never in such a dark house before. I--I think I\nwon't stay. I'll go home and tell my mother everything. That's what the\nother gentleman advised and I--I _liked him_. Good-bye,\" said the now\nfrightened girl, and turned about on that flight to the third story.\n\nBut Mr. Smith was right behind her. She'd have to brush past him to\ndescend the narrow stairway, and he was again chattering away,\npretending not to hear her objections, but glibly explaining:\n\n\"The reason the house is so dark is because it is so old--one of the\noldest in the city, I've been told. Besides, each floor has been turned\ninto a flat, or suite of offices, and the tenants keep their doors\nclosed. That's why I chose the top story for my own use--it's so much\nlighter, and--Here we are!\"\n\nHere they were, indeed, but by no stretch of imagination could the\napartment be called light. There was a skylight over the top of the\nstairs, but this was darkened by gray holland shades, and though there\nappeared to be three rooms on this floor, the doors of all were closed\nas the doors on the floors below.\n\nDorothy was trembling visibly, as her guide opened the door of the\nmiddle room--the \"dark one\" of the peculiarly constructed city\nhouses--and she faced absolute blackness. But her host seemed to know\nthe way and to be surprised that nobody was present to receive them.\nWith exclamations of annoyance he hurried to light a single gas jet and\nthe small flame illumined a dingy, most untidy \"office.\"\n\nYet still with a grand flourish of manner the lawyer pushed a chair\nbefore a littered desk, rummaged till he found paper, ink, and pen, and\nwaved his small client toward it. She was almost in tears, from her\nfright; yet still bolstered her courage with the thought: \"For my father\nand mother!\" and resolved to see the business through.\n\nCertainly no such gentlemanly appearing person could intend injury to an\nunprotected child. Why should she imagine it?\n\nDrawing the paper toward her she began to write and had quickly finished\nthe brief note which told her mother as much, and no more than, her\ninstructor had prescribed. He had kept his eyes rather closely fixed\nupon the wrinkled envelope she held, and now carelessly remarked:\n\n\"You could send that letter home with your note, too, if you wish,\nthough you'll be detained only a little while. I don't see why that\nwitness I spoke of hasn't come. I do hate a dilatory client! Will she\nneed it, do you think?\"\n\n\"She might. I will send it, I guess,\" answered poor Dorothy, and giving\nthe folded envelope still another twist, enclosed and sealed it in her\nown note which she handed to her \"lawyer.\"\n\nHe took it, hastily, and informed her that he would \"just trip down\nthose troublesome stairs and find a messenger boy, then be back in a\njiffy.\"\n\nAs he reckoned time a \"jiffy\" must have meant several hours; for the\nwhole day had passed and still he had not returned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTENANTS FOR NO. 77\n\n\n\"Oh! do get out of the way, Ma'am Puss! What possesses you to be always\nunder foot? If you're looking for your little mistress she's not here,\nShe's gone away down town on business,\" cried Mrs. Chester to the cat,\nas she stumbled over the creature for the third time in about as many\nminutes.\n\nThe animal's behavior annoyed her. For some time it had kept up an\nintermittent and most doleful mewing and, as if seeking some precious\nthing no longer to be found, it had wandered in and out of corners in a\nnerve-distracting way.\n\nThe house mistress herself was almost as uneasy as the cat, and she had\nendured about all the mental strain she could without collapse; or, at\nleast, venting her overtaxed patience upon somebody. Ma'am Puss happened\nto be the \"somebody\" most convenient, and with a fresh sinking of her\nspirits, Martha Chester recalled the many frolics her husband, as well\nas daughter, had had with their pet. Would anything in her life ever be\nagain as it had been!\n\nSitting down in the nearest chair, for a moment, the lonely woman took\nthe sleek maltese into her arms and held it close, stroking its fur\naffectionately, and in a manner to surprise the recipient of this most\nunusual attention. For Martha didn't like cats; and the only reason\nMa'am Puss was tolerated on her premises was because she liked rats and\nmice still less. But now she not only petted but confided to the purring\nfeline the fact:\n\n\"Dorothy has been gone four hours, and I'm dreadfully worried. At the\nlongest she shouldn't have been gone more'n two, even if there was a\nhold-up on the car line. Besides, she wouldn't have waited for such a\nthing, anyway. She'd have started home on her own feet, first, for she's\na loving child and knows I need her help. That money-letter! I'm afraid\nsomebody's waylaid her and took it away. It wasn't so much--to some\npeople--but ten dollars? Why, Puss, a man was murdered out Towson way\nfor less than that, not so long ago! I wish she'd come. Oh! How I wish\nshe'd come!\"\n\nBut Dorothy did not come. There was no sign of her on the street, no\nmatter how many times the anxious watcher ran to the door and looked\nout; and the four hours were fast lengthening into five when the first\nchange came to divert Mrs. Chester's thoughts, for the time being, from\nher terrible forebodings. As she gazed in one direction for the sight of\na blue gingham frock a cheerful voice called to her from another:\n\n\"Howdy, Mis' Chester? Now ain't I brought you the greatest luck? Here's\nmy sister-in-law, without chick nor child to upset things, and only a\nhusband that's night watchman--is going to be--come right here to\nBaltimore an' is looking for a house. Firm he's worked for is putting up\na new factory, right over in them open lots beyond an' nothin' to do but\nhe must take care of 'em. This is my sister-in-law, Mis' Jones, Mis'\nChester. I was a Jones myself. Well, they're ready to rent or buy,\nreasonable, either one; and I reckon it's a chance you won't get in a\nhurry--no children, too! What you say?\"\n\nFor a moment Martha could say nothing, except to bid her callers enter\nthe house and to place them comfortably in the cool parlor; and even her\nfirst remark bore little on the subject Mrs. Bruce had presented.\nHanding fans all round she ejaculated:\n\n\"It's so terrible hot! I'm all beat out--picking up and--and worrying.\"\n\n\"Well, to get your house off your hands so sudden'll be one worry less,\"\ncomforted Mrs. Bruce, fanning herself vigorously and looking as if such\na thing as anxiety had never entered her own contented mind.\n\n\"I--I just stepped 'round to the drug-store, a spell ago, and telephoned\nto three real-estate men to come up an' look things over. I--Why, it's\nonly Monday morning, and I've got a whole week yet. I mean--It seems so\nsudden. I've got to see John--No, I haven't. It seems dreadful to take\nsuch steps, do business without him, which I never have, but the\ndoctors--How much rent'd you be willing to pay, Mis' Jones?\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Chester was strangely distraught. Her neighbor, the plumber's\nwife, had never seen her like this, but she understood some part of what\nthe other was suffering, though, as yet, she was ignorant of Dorothy's\nprolonged absence; and she again tried to console:\n\n\"I know just how you feel. Havin' slaved so long to pay for the house,\nout of a postman's salary, an' him an' you bein' such a happy contented\ncouple--Don't doubt I'm feelin' for you an' wantin' to lend a hand, if\nso be I can. As to rent, there ain't never no houses on this one-hunderd\nblock of Brown Street _to_ rent. We both know that, 'cause it's the\nnicest kept one, with the prettiest back yard anywhere's near. No negro\nhouses in the alleys, neither. So, course, this is a splendid chance for\nBill and Jane; but I asked Mr. Bruce an' he said twenty dollars a month\nwas fair and the goin' rates.\"\n\nMrs. Chester listened with still greater dismay. At the utmost she had\nexpected the watchman would offer no more than fifteen dollars, but\ntwenty! The highest rate she had looked to receive from anybody. Of\ncourse she wanted to rent--she had now fully decided not to sell--but to\nsucceed so promptly, was almost like having the ground taken from\nbeneath her feet.\n\nAt last she forced herself to say:\n\n\"I know it's a good chance. I'm not unmindful it's a neighborly thing in\nyou, Mrs. Bruce, or that Mrs. Jones'd make a good tenant. I'm--Well,\nI'll try to give you your answer some time to-night. Will that do?\"\n\nMrs. Bruce rose and there was some asperity in her tone as she returned:\n\n\"I s'pose it'll have to do, since you're the one to pass the word. But\nwe'll look round, other houses, anyway. My folks have left their old\nplace an' this week's the only idle one Bill'll have. He wants to help\nJane settle--she ain't overly strong--and they'd like to move in\na-Wednesday, or Thursday mornin' at the latest.\"\n\n\"So--soon!\" gasped the mistress of No. 77. Despite her will a tear\nstole down her cheek and her warm-hearted neighbor was instantly moved\nto greater sympathy. Laying her fat hand on Mrs. Chester's bowed head\nshe urged:\n\n\"Keep up your spirit, Martha. If you just rent, why you know you can\ncome back any time. A month's notice, give an' take, that's all. I'm\nhopin' John'll get well right away, an' you'll all come flyin' back to\nBaltimore. By the way, where's Dorothy? Mabel said she wasn't goin' to\nschool no more.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Bruce, I don't know! I don't know!\" and the anxious mother\npoured out her perplexities in the ear of this other mother, who\npromptly said:\n\n\"Well, if I was you, Martha Chester, I'd put on my hat and go straight\ndown to that post-office an' find out what had become of her. If 'twas\nMabel, I should.\"\n\n\"Oh! that's what I've been longing to do! But I thought the real-estate\nmen might come, and I dared not leave. I'm getting so nervous I can't\nkeep still, and as for going on with my packing, it's no use. I must go\nto see John, this afternoon, too, and----\"\n\n\"Martha Chester, have you had a bite to eat?\" demanded Mrs. Bruce, in an\naccusing tone.\n\nMartha smiled, and reluctantly answered:\n\n\"I don't believe I have. I didn't think, but--course, it's past lunch\ntime.\"\n\n\"Lunch! Hear her, Jane. She's one o' the fashionable women 't cooks her\ndinner at sundown!\" cried the plumber's wife, with an attempt at\nraillery, but in her mind already deciding that hunger was half the\nmatter with her neighbor's nerves. \"Now, look here, the pair of you. Me\nan' him is more sensibler. We have our dinner at dinner time, and you\nknow that was as nice a vegetable soup we had this noon, Jane Jones, as\never was made, an' you needn't deny it. You just stay here a minute an'\nMartha'll show you round the house, an' the garden--That garden'll\ntickle Bill 'most to death, he's that set on posies!--while I skip home\nand fetch a pail of it. 'Twon't take a minute to do it, an' it can be\nhet up on the gas stove, even if the range fire's out. By that time\nDorothy C. 'll have got back: an' me an' Jane'll help her keep house\nwhile you step across to Johns Hopkins. I reckon that's good plannin',\nso you begin while I skip.\"\n\nThe idea of corpulent Mrs. Bruce \"skipping\" brought a smile to both the\nlisteners' faces, but Martha was already greatly comforted and now\nrealized that she was, indeed, faint from want of food. She had taken\nbut little breakfast, being \"too busy to eat,\" as she explained; but she\nnow set out on a tour of the little house with much pride in it, and in\nthe fact that taken unaware, even, it would be found in spotless order.\nHer washing was already drying in the sunny garden among the roses and\nMrs. Jones's delight over that part of the premises was most flattering.\n\nIndeed, there was a dainty simplicity about the little country-woman\nwhich now quite won Mrs. Chester's heart, and after they had examined\neach of the rooms, and each had found Mrs. Jones more and more\nenthusiastic, the impulsive housemistress exclaimed:\n\n\"Maybe you'll think I'm queer, but I believe the Lord just sent you!\nThat you're the very one will love our home for us while we're away.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm glad to hear you say that. It's the way I feel about things. I\nain't so glib a talker as _his_ folks is, but I think a good deal. I've\nalways hankered to live in a city, where if _I_ wanted a bucket of\nwater, all I'd have to do would be to turn a spigot, 'stead of tugging\nit up a hill from a spring or hauling it out a well. An' Bill, he's\ntidy. I've trained him. I begun right off, soon's we was married. The\nJoneses they--well, they ain't none of 'em too partic'lar, though\nwarmer-hearted folks never lived. But, my man? Why, bless you, now he'd\nno more think o' comin' in from outdoors without takin' off his boots\nan' puttin' on his slippers 'an he'd think o' flyin'. I didn't have to\nscold him into it, neither. 'Twas just himself seein' me get down an'\nscrub up the mud he'd tracked in, without even wipin' his feet. But, my!\nI said I wasn't no talker, an' here I'm makin' myself out a\nstory-teller. But, if so be you an' him come to a right agreement, I\npromise you one thing: I'll take just as good care, or better, of your\nprop'ty as if it was my own. Nobody couldn't do more than that, could\nthey?\"\n\n\"No, indeed: and I'm glad I can have such good news to tell John when I\ngo to him. After all, Mrs. Jones, property troubles don't compare with\ntroubles of your heart. I feel so different, all in these few minutes,\nso glad you came. I reckon there won't be no difficulty about the\nagreement: and--look! There comes Mrs. Bruce already and a colored girl\nwith her.\"\n\nThe plumber's wife entered, panting from her efforts to carry a big pail\nof soup at sufficient distance from her fat sides to keep it from\nspilling, and announcing that the basket the little colored maid had in\nhand contained \"a few other things I picked up, might come in nice.\"\n\n\"An' I collared 'Mandy, here, on the street. She's the girl does my\nfront, an' I thought she might do yours, to-day. She does it for a\nnickel and don't you pay her no more. Hear, 'Mandy? If you leave a speck\non this lady's steps, I won't give you that baker's cake I promised.\nWhere's your cleanin' things, Mis' Chester?\"\n\nThese were quickly produced and then the housemistress sat down to her\nmeal, her guests declining to join her in it, though more than willing\nto sit beside her and talk while she ate. Moreover, Mrs. Bruce was\nextremely proud to show this other notable housekeeper a specimen of her\nown cooking, knowing that she was usually considered a failure in that\nline, but had succeeded well this time.\n\nThen said Mrs. Jones:\n\n\"I've been thinkin' things over a mite, whilst you two talked. Bill's\nand my goods are to the depot here, ready packed an' waitin', and I've\nnot a hand's turn to do, till I get a place to unpack them in. If you'll\nlet me I'd admire to come help you get your stuff ready for movin'.\nHavin' just done mine I've sort of got my hand in, so to speak, an' can\ntake hold capable. I'll look after the house, too, and learn the ways of\nit, while you're off on your errands or seeing your husband, or the\nlike. What say, sister, to that notion?\"\n\n\"I call it first-rate: an' I'll be able to help some, 'tween times. Now,\nMartha Chester, if you've finished your dinner, be off with you. Jane\nan' me'll do everything all right, an' I'm getting as wild to have\nDorothy back as you are. Don't suppose she's one to run away an' play\nwith some the school children, do you?\" said Mrs. Bruce.\n\n\"No, I don't. I wish I did think she might, but Dorothy never ran away,\nnot in all her life, except when she was a mite of a thing and followed\nher father on his route. Well, you can tell the real-estate men, if they\ncome, 't the thing is settled already. I say it 'tis, but I reckon\nthey'll be some put out, comin' up here for nothing. Good-bye. Do wish\nme good luck! and I'll hurry back.\"\n\nLate though she felt that she was for her hospital visit, Mrs. Chester\nhurried first to the post-office, her anxiety increasing all the way,\nand reached it just as Mr. Lathrop was leaving it for his last delivery.\nTo her anxious inquiry he returned a discouraging:\n\n\"No. I haven't seen Dorothy since early this morning, when I helped her\na bit in getting her money-letter. But I'll ask if anybody else knows\nwhat became of her. Doubtless she'll turn up all right and with a\nsimple explanation of her absence. She's a bright little girl, you'll\nfind her all safe. I'll go back with you now.\"\n\nThus for the second time that day, the busy postman delayed his own work\nto do kindness to a comrade's family, nor could he quite understand why\nhis faith in his own words was less than he wished hers to be. It was\nrare to hear of a child being lost in that safe city, and it would be a\nbitter blow to the already afflicted John Chester if harm befell his\nadopted daughter. When no good news could be obtained here, he advised\nMartha to go on to the hospital but to say nothing to her husband of\nDorothy. He would notify the police, and if she had met with any\naccident, or by some rare mischance lost her way, she would speedily be\ntraced.\n\nBecause she could do no better, Mrs. Chester followed his advice,\nboarded a car for the hospital, and was soon at her husband's side. But\nalas! She was to find no comfort in this interview. With a natural\nreaction from his first elation over the possibility of recovery he was\nnow greatly depressed. Having lived so long on will-power, and having\nonce given up, he had developed a great weakness of body, and, in a\ndegree, of mind. Before his wife was admitted to his presence she was\nwarned that nothing but the pleasantest topics must be discussed, and\nwas told that the doctors now desired him to be removed to the country\nright away.\n\n\"This terrible heat has injured him, as it has others. Get him out of\ntown at once, Mrs. Chester, if you would save his life.\"\n\nSo when he asked for Dorothy she ignored his question, but talked glibly\nof the fine chance that they had of letting the house: yet to her\namazement he showed no interest in this matter.\n\n\"Do whatever you think best, little woman. I don't care. I don't believe\nI'll ever care about anything in the world again.\"\n\n\"Oh, John! Don't say that. You'll be better soon. But, good-bye till\nto-morrow:\" and hastily bidding him expect her then, with some home\nflowers and \"lots of good news,\" she hurried away.\n\n\"No news?\" she asked, as her own door opened to receive her, and the\ngentle little country-woman welcomed her.\n\n\"Oh! no. Not yet. Ain't hardly time!\" cheerfully responded Jane Jones,\njust as if she were imparting other tidings. \"Mustn't look for miracles,\nnowadays. That child's off visitin', somewheres, you may depend. And you\nmustn't be hard on her when she comes back,\" advised this new friend.\n\n\"Hard on her? Me? Why, I'd give ten years of my life to know she was\nsafe, this minute! _Hard on her!_ All I ask is to hold her fast in my\narms once more. But, course, you don't know Dorothy C. The little child\nthat was _sent_, and that's made John an' me so happy all her life.\nLook. Here's her picture. We thought it was extravagant, but somehow we\nfelt we had to have it. 'Twas taken this very spring, on the same day we\nfound her on the steps.\"\n\nFrom a little secretary in the dining room Mrs. Chester produced the\nphotograph, still carefully wrapped in its waxed paper covering, and\ndisplayed to her admiring guest the picture of a very lovely child. The\nshapely head was crowned by short brown curls, the big brown eyes looked\neagerly forth, and the pretty red lips were curved in a half-smile that\nwas altogether bewitching.\n\n\"Why! She's a beauty! A regular beauty! She looks as if she belonged to\nhigh-up folks; I declare she does,\" commented Mrs. Jones.\n\nMother Martha was touched by this sincere admiration, and lifting the\npicture to her lips lightly pressed a kiss upon it. Then she carefully\nput it away again, saying with a sigh:\n\n\"We'd laid out to get it framed, soon, and hang it in the parlor. That's\nwhy we had but one taken. John thought one big one was better worth\nwhile than a dozen small ones. My! Hark! What's that? Such a ring--my\nheart's in my mouth--you open the door--please--I can't!\" and so\nimploring, Mrs. Chester sank upon the lounge and covered her face with\nher hands.\n\nEven Mrs. Jones was all a-tremble and her hands fumbled so with the\nunfamiliar latch that the housemistress sprang to her feet and opened\nthe door herself with the glad cry:\n\n\"Dorothy! Dorothy, have you come?\"\n\n\"Not Dorothy, Mrs. Chester; just Lathrop, you know, with a detective,\ncome to get some points.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSTRANGE EXPERIENCES\n\n\n\"Why doesn't he come back! Oh! what will my mother think of my staying\naway like this? All the help she has now, too, and needing me so much.\nI'll wait just five minutes longer, then I'll go home, anyway, whether\nthat 'witness' who's to tell me so much about myself and my real father\nand mother comes or not. No father or mother could be as dear to me as\nfather John and mother Martha. I don't want any others. Let them keep\ntheir old fortune the rest of the time, since they've kept it so long\nand never sent for me,\" said Dorothy C. to herself, after she had waited\nwith what slight patience she could for Mr. Smith's return, and more\nthan an hour had already passed.\n\nHitherto she had not deemed it polite to explore her present quarters,\nbut now began to do so in an idle sort of way. If her \"lawyer\" left her\nso long alone he couldn't blame her if she amused herself in some\nmanner; and first she examined the few books which were tossed in a heap\non the untidy desk. They did not look like law-books, many of them,\nthough one or two were bound in dirty calf-skin and showed much\nhandling. In any case none of them interested her.\n\nNext she tried to open the window, that gave upon the hall from one side\nof the room as the door by which she had entered did upon another, but\nfound it fast.\n\n\"Why, that's funny! What would anybody want to nail an inside window\ntight for? Oh! maybe because this is an apartment house, he said, and\nother people might come in. My father says he wouldn't like to live in a\nflat, it's so mixed up with different families. He'd rather have a tiny\nhouse like ours and have it separate. Well! if I can't open the window,\nI reckon I can that door which must go into a back room.\"\n\nImmediately she proceeded to try this second door, which was opposite\nthe nailed window, and, to her delight, found that it yielded easily to\nher touch. But the room thus disclosed was almost as dark as the\n\"office\" she had just quitted, although it had two windows at the back.\nThe upper sashes of these had been lowered as far as possible, but\nbehind them were wooden shutters and these were also nailed, or spiked\nfast. There were crescent-shaped holes in the tops of the shutters and\nthrough these a little air and light penetrated into the gloom of what,\nnow that her eyes had become accustomed to the dimness, she perceived\nwas a bedroom. From one side of this opened a bathroom, whose window was\nsecured like those of the bedroom, but where was the cheerful sound of\nrunning water.\n\nNow terribly frightened by her strange surroundings, Dorothy's throat\ngrew so dry and parched that she hastened to get a drink from the\nfaucet, beneath which hung a rusty tin cup. Then she thought:\n\n\"Maybe I can get out into the hall by this bathroom door!\"\n\nIt could not be opened, and now half-frantic with fear, the imprisoned\ngirl ran from one door to another, only to find that while she had the\nfreedom of the three apartments, every exit from these into the hall was\nsecurely bolted, or locked, upon the outside, and realized that it was\nwith some evil intention she had been brought to this place.\n\nFor hours she worked over doors, then windows, and back again to the\ndoors--testing her puny strength against them, only to fail each time.\nThe heat was intolerable in the rooms, for it was the top story of a\nsmall house with the sun beating against the roof. Even below, in the\nstreet, people mopped their faces and groaned beneath this unseasonable\ntemperature. As for poor Dorothy, she felt herself growing faint, and\nremembered that she, as well as her mother, had taken but a light\nbreakfast; but her eyes had now grown accustomed to the dim light of the\nrooms and the gas jet still flickered in the \"office,\" so that, after a\ntime, she threw herself on the bed, worn out with her efforts and hoping\na few moments' rest might help her \"to think a way out\" of her prison.\n\nHow long she slept, she never knew, for it was that of utter\nexhaustion, but she was suddenly roused by the sound of a bolt shot in\nits lock, and the opening of the \"office\" door. It was Mr. Smith\nreturning, profuse with apologies which Dorothy scarcely heard and\nwholly disdained, as, darting past him, she made for the entrance with\nall her speed.\n\n\"Why, Miss Chester! Don't, I beg, don't treat me so suspiciously.\nIndeed, it is quite as I tell you. I was--was detained against my will.\nI have only just now been able to come back here, and you must\nimagine--for I cannot describe them--what my sufferings have been on\nyour account. I know that you'll think hardly of me, but, indeed, I mean\nyou nothing but good. Wait, please; wait just a moment and taste these\nsandwiches I've brought and this bottle of milk. You must be famished.\nYou can't? You won't? Why, my dear young lady, how am I ever to do you\nany good if you mistrust me so on such slight grounds?\"\n\n\"Slight grounds!\" almost screamed Dorothy, struggling to free herself\nfrom the man's grasp, which, apparently gentle, was still far too firm\nfor her to resist.\n\nAt once, also, he began again to talk, so fast, so plausibly, that his\nwords fairly tripped each other up, and still pressing upon her\nacceptance a paper of very dainty sandwiches and a glass of most\ninnocent appearing milk.\n\n\"Just take these first. I should be distressed beyond measure to have\nyou return to your home in this condition. I have a carriage at the door\nto carry you there and we'll start immediately after you have eaten, or\nat least drank something. You needn't be so alarmed. Your mother\nreceived your note only a few moments after you sent it, with the\nenvelope enclosed. She is now most anxious for you to hear all that my\nwitness--witnesses, in fact--have to disclose as to your real parentage\nand possessions. It is such a grand thing for her and her husband, now\nthat he has lost his health. Just five minutes, to keep yourself from\nfainting, then we'll be off. Indeed, I'm far more anxious to be on the\nroad than you are, I so deeply regret this misadventure.\"\n\nAt that moment there was the ring of sincerity in his words, and also\njust then there was the sound of footsteps on the stairs, followed by\nthe appearance at the door of a hack-driver in the attire of his class.\n\n\"Time's erbout up, suh, 't I was hired for, an' soon's you-all's ready,\nsuh, I----\"\n\n\"All right, Jehu. I'll pay for overtime, but can't hurry a young lady,\nyou know. Especially one that's been shut up by accident almost all day\nin my office.\" Then turning to Dorothy, who still refrained from\ntouching the sandwiches which, however, began to look irresistibly\ntempting, he begged: \"At least drink the milk. This good fellow seems to\nbe in haste, though it's only a few minutes' drive to Brown Street and\nyou can nibble the sandwiches in the carriage.\"\n\nShe was not worldly-wise, she was very hungry, and the man seemed\nprofoundly distressed that she had suffered such treatment at his hands.\nMoreover, it appeared that the shortest way to liberty was to obey him.\nShe would drink the milk, she was fairly famishing for it, but once\nupon the street she would enter no carriage of his providing but trust\nrather to her own nimble feet to reach her home, and, if need be, to the\nprotection of the first policeman she could summon.\n\nWrapping the sandwiches once more in their paper, she hastily drank the\nmilk and again started to leave. This time she was not prevented nor as\nthey left the \"office\" did its proprietor use the precaution of the bolt\nwhich anybody from outside could unfasten--none from within! But he did\nturn out the gas, with a noteworthy prudence, and still retained his\ncourteous support of Dorothy's arm.\n\nReleased at last from the imprisonment which had so terrified her she\nwas strangely dizzy. Her head felt very much as it had done when she had\nbeen knocked down by Mrs. Cecil's big dogs, and it was now of her own\naccord that she clutched Mr. Smith's arm, fearing she would fall.\n\nHow far, far away sounded the hackman's footsteps, retreating before\nthem to the street! How queerly her feet jogged up and down on the\nstairs, which seemed to spring upward into her very face as she\ndescended! In all her life she had never, never felt so tired and\ncuriously weak as now, when all the power to move her limbs seemed\nsuddenly to leave her.\n\n\"Ah! the carriage!\" She could dimly see it, in the glare of an electric\nlight, and now she welcomed it most eagerly. If ever she were to reach\nthat blessed haven of home she would have to be carried there. So she\nmade no remonstrance when she was bodily lifted into the coup\u00c3\u00a9 and\nplaced upon its cushions, where, at once, she went to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Here girl. Time you woke up and took your breakfast.\"\n\nAfter that strange dizziness in descending the stairs of the house in\nHoward Street, Dorothy's first sensation was one of languid surprise. A\nbig, coarse-looking woman stood beside the bed on which she lay, holding\na plate in one hand, a cup in the other. Broad beams of sunlight\nstreamed through an uncurtained window near, and a fresh breeze blew in\nfrom the fields beyond.\n\n\"Why--the country! Have we come to it so soon and I not knowing? Mother!\nWhere is my mother?\" she asked, gaining in strength and rising upon her\nelbow. Then she saw that she had lain down without undressing and\ncautiously stepped to the floor, which was bare and not wholly clean.\nHer head felt light and dizzy still, so that she suddenly again sat down\non the bed's edge to recover herself. Thereupon the woman dragged a\nwooden chair forward and, placing the breakfast on it, said:\n\n\"I can't bother no more. Eat it or leave it. I've got my fruit to pick.\"\n\nThen she turned away, but Dorothy reached forward, caught the blue denim\nskirt, and demanded:\n\n\"Tell me where my mother is? I want her. I want her right away.\"\n\n\"Like enough. I don't know. I'm goin'. I'll be in to get your dinner.\nYou can lie down again or do what you want, only stay inside. Orders.\"\n\nDorothy was very hungry. The hunger of yesterday was nothing compared to\nthe craving she felt now and, postponing all further questions till\nthat was satisfied, she fell to eating the contents of the great plate\nwith greed. Then she drank the bowl of coffee and, still strangely\ndrowsy, lay back upon the pillow and again instantly dropped asleep.\n\nThe clatter of dishes in the room beyond that one where she lay was what\nnext roused her and her head was now nearly normal. Only a dull pain\nremained and her wits were clearing of the mist that had enveloped them.\nMemories of strange stories came to her, and she thought:\n\n\"Something has happened to me, more than I dreamed. I've been kidnapped!\nI see it, understand it all now. But--why? _Why?_ An orphan foundling\nlike me--what should anybody steal me away from my home for? Father and\nmother have no money to pay ransom--like that little boy father read\nabout in the paper--who was stolen and not given back till thousands of\ndollars were sent. But I'm somewhere in the country now, and in a house\nthat's all open, every side. It's easy to get away from _here_. I'll go.\nI'll go right away, soon as I wash my face and brush my hair--if I can\nfind a brush. I'll go into that other room and act just as if I wasn't\nafraid and--that dinner smells good!\"\n\nThe big woman, whose denim skirt and blouse suggested the overalls of a\nday laborer, was bending over a small cooking stove whereon was frying\nsome bacon and eggs. A great pot of boiled potatoes waited on the\nstove-hearth, and on an oilcloth-covered table were set out a few\ndishes. A boy was just entering the kitchen from the lean-to beyond and\nwas carrying a wooden pail of water with a tin dipper. He was almost as\ntall as the woman but bore no further resemblance to her, being\nextremely thin and fair. Indeed, his hair was so nearly white that\nDorothy stared at it, and his eyes were very blue, while the woman\nlooked like a swarthy foreigner from some south country.\n\nMother Martha had a saying, when anybody about her was inclined to\nsharpness of speech, that \"you can catch more flies with molasses than\nwith vinegar,\" and, oddly enough, the adage came to Dorothy's mind at\nthat very instant. She had come into the kitchen prepared to demand her\nliberty and to be directed home, but she now spoke as politely as she\nwould have done to the minister's wife:\n\n\"Please, madam, will you show me where I can wash and freshen myself a\nlittle? I feel so dirty I'd like to do it before I eat my dinner or go\nhome.\"\n\nThe woman rose from above her frying pan with a face of astonishment.\nShe was so tanned and burned by the sun as well as by the heat of\ncooking that the contrast between herself and her son--if he were her\nson--made him look fairly ghostlike. Furthermore, as the inwardly\nanxious, if outwardly suave, little girl perceived--her face was more\nstupid than vicious.\n\nWithout the waste of a word the woman nodded over her shoulder toward\nthe lean-to and proceeded to dish up her bacon, now cooked to her\nsatisfaction. She placed it in the middle of a great yellow platter, the\neggs around it, and a row of potatoes around them. Then she set the\nplatter on the table, drew her own chair to it, filled a tin plate with\nthe mixture, and proceeded with her dinner. She made no remark when the\nboy, also, sat down, and neither of them waited an instant for their\ngirl guest.\n\nBut Dorothy's spirit was now roused and she felt herself fully equal to\ndealing with these rustics: and it was with all the dignity she could\nsummon that she drew a third chair to the table and herself sat down,\nsaying:\n\n\"Now, if you please, I wish to be told where I am and how I came here.\"\n\nThe hostess paid no more heed than if a fly had touched her, but the lad\npaused in the act of shoveling food into his mouth and stared at\nDorothy, as he might have done at the same fly, could it have spoken.\nNor did he remove his gaze from her till she had repeated her question.\nThen he shifted it to the woman's face, who waited awhile longer, then\nsaid:\n\n\"I tell nothing. Drink your milk.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Then I suppose I must find out for myself. I don't care for\nthe milk, thank you. I rarely drink it at home, but I'm fond of bacon\nand eggs, and yours look nice. Please serve me some.\"\n\nThe woman made no answer. She had finished her own meal and left the\nothers to do the same. So, as the taciturn creature departed for the\nopen fields, with a hoe over her shoulder, Dorothy drew the platter\ntoward her, found a third empty tin plate, and helped herself.\n\nShe had noticed one thing that the others had, apparently, not known she\nhad: a sign of silence interchanged between the woman and the lanky lad.\nHe had been bidden to hold his tongue and been left to clear up the\ndinner matters. He did this as deftly as a girl, though not after the\nmanner in which Dorothy had been trained: and casting a look of contempt\nupon him, she finished her dinner, rose, and quietly left the room and\nthe house.\n\nBut she got no further than a few rods' distance when she felt a strong\nhand on her arm, herself turned rudely about, and led back to the\ncottage. There she was pushed upon the doorstep and a note thrust into\nher hand by this abnormally silent woman, who had returned from the\nfield as suddenly as if she had sprung from the earth at the girl's very\nfeet.\n\nThe note was plainly enough written and to the point:\n\n     \"Stay quiet where you are and you'll soon be set free. Try to run\n     away and you'll meet big trouble.\"\n\nThere was no signature and the handwriting was unknown: and Dorothy was\nstill blankly gazing at it when it was snatched from her hand, the woman\nhad again disappeared, and a huge mastiff had come around the corner of\nthe cottage, to seat himself upon the doorstep beside her. His\nattentions might have been friendly; but Dorothy was afraid of dogs, and\nshrank from this one into the smallest space possible, while there\nfluttered down over her shoulder the note that had been seized. There\nwas now pinned to it a scrap of paper on which were scrawled three\nwords:\n\n\"Drink no milk.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE FLITTING\n\n\nDisappointed, Mrs. Chester had stepped back into her little hall, and\nthe postman with the detective followed. Then they went further still\nand settled themselves in the parlor, as if come for a prolonged stay.\nTo the detective's inquiry whether the missing Dorothy had recently met\nany strangers, made acquaintances who might be able to furnish some clew\nto her present whereabouts--as friends of longer standing had not been\nable--the mother answered: \"No. She was always at home or in the\nimmediate neighborhood.\"\n\nBut conquering her timidity, the country-woman now interrupted:\n\n\"Wait a minute. Mabel was here yesterday, wasn't she?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. She came home with my little girl from Sunday school and\nspent part of the day. Why she did not stay longer I don't know. What\nof it?\" returned mother Martha, drearily.\n\n\"She didn't stay longer because she was sent home. I was there and I\nnoticed what a good-natured child she was not to get mad about it. She\ntold her mother that Dorothy had a gentleman caller and had to see him\non business. We both laughed over it, 'cause 'twas so grown-up an'\nold-fashioned like. An', sister, she said as how city children didn't\nscarce have any childhood, they begun to be beauin' each other round so\nearly. We _laughed_, but still, I thought 'twas a pity, for I like\nlittle girls to stay such, long as they can.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! My Dorothy is--was the simplest child in the world. A\ngentleman caller--the idea is ridiculous!\" cried Mrs. Chester,\nindignantly, and poor Mrs. Jones felt herself snubbed and wished that\nshe had held her tongue.\n\nNot so the detective, who quietly asked:\n\n\"Who is this Mabel, and where can she be found?\"\n\n\"She's my niece an' likely she'll be found in bed, by now. No matter\nabout that, though. If you'd like to see her I'll fetch her to once,\"\nanswered Mrs. Jones, promptly rising.\n\n\"Do so, please,\" said the officer, and the woman hurried away.\n\nThe postman friend employed the interval of her absence in telling the\nplans formed by \"the boys\" for the benefit of their ailing comrade.\n\n\"You see, Mrs. Chester, John's about the best liked man on the force and\nwe want he should be the best cared for. So, to-night, after I saw you I\nran over to the hospital myself and saw one the doctors--the one that\nhas most to say about John. He wants to get him into the country right\naway. Then back I hurried and got leave of absence, from Wednesday night\ntill next Monday morning, and I'm going with you, to help you on the\ntrip and see him settled all straight. No--Don't say a word yet! It'll\nbe all right. It's settled. You can get ready.\"\n\n\"Oh! but I can't, I can't!\" protested Martha, deeply touched by this\nkindness, yet feeling as if she were being fairly hurled out of her old\nlife into the new one. Besides, if this mystery of Dorothy's\ndisappearance were not cleared she could never leave the city, never!\nand so she stoutly declared.\n\n\"But--it's a case of adopted daughter _versus_ a husband's life, seems\nto me,\" put in the detective quietly. \"Moreover, I'm told by Lathrop,\nhere, that Chester isn't to be worried about anything. _Anything._ His\nchance of recovery depends on it.\"\n\nThe tortured housemistress was vastly relieved to see not only Mabel,\nbut the entire household of Bruce-and-Jones, coming swiftly toward the\nhouse and presently entering at the doorway, left open because of the\ngreat heat. Both the plumber and his wife were panting from their\nexertions; Mr. Jones was as excited as if he were going to a circus; his\nwife uncommonly proud of her part in the occasion; and the terrified\nMabel weeping loudly:\n\n\"I don't know a thing! I don't--I don't!\"\n\n\"Why, Miss Bruce, what a surprising statement from such a bright-looking\nyoung lady as you!\" exclaimed the detective, suavely, and the girl\nstopped sobbing long enough to see that this was no formidable\npoliceman in blue-and-brass but a very simple gentleman, in a business\nsuit rather the worse for wear. In another moment he had gallantly\nplaced this possibly important witness in the coziest corner of the\nsofa, and had placed himself beside her, as if to protect her from the\ninquisitiveness of her friends.\n\nThen in a tone so low that it effectually prevented their words being\noverheard, he deftly drew from the now reassured Mabel a much better\ndescription of Dorothy's caller than fear would have extorted. Indeed,\nshe became inclined to enlarge upon facts, as she saw her statements\nrecorded in a small notebook. But this finally held no more than the\nbrief entry:\n\n\"Tall. Light hair. Left eye squints. Eyebrows meet. Glib. Name not\ngiven.\"\n\nThen the notebook was closed and pocketed, the cross-examination was\nover, and all were free to take a part in a discussion--which they did\nso volubly, that the detective smiled and called a halt. Moreover, his\nwords had the weight of one who knew, as he said:\n\n\"We've gone into this business very promptly, and it must, for the\npresent, be kept out of the newspapers, else the guilty party who is\ndetaining Dorothy--if there is such a party--will be warned and may\nescape. It is but twelve hours since the child disappeared. At the end\nof another twenty-four will be time enough to publish. Meanwhile, Madam,\nrest assured that we shall keep steadily at work, trying to locate your\nmissing daughter and--I wish you all good-evening.\"\n\nThe gentleman's departure was a relief. It seemed to lessen the horror\nof Dorothy's absence, though her mother was glad to know that the\nefforts of the police were being made to trace her. But--Why, the\ndarling might come walking in, at any moment, and how distressed she'd\nbe to find herself an object of such unpleasant importance!\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Chester,\" said Mr. Lathrop, \"we 'boys' don't want you to\nworry one minute about this moving business. We've agreed to send a\nprofessional packer and his men here, the first thing to-morrow morning.\nYou needn't touch one thing. It's better that you should not, for if\nall is left to this man he is responsible for everything. You just\nrest, visit John and get him braced up for his journey, and take it\neasy. If little Dorothy is back before Thursday morning, when we start,\nall right. She shall go with us and be the life of the party. If she\nisn't--why, as soon as she does come, some way will be found, somebody,\nto bring her safely to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Lathrop! You and the 'boys' are goodness itself, but I can't--I\ncannot go away in such uncertainty. If Dorothy isn't found--John will be\nthe first one to say that we must wait until she is.\"\n\nThis was a natural attitude of mind, and Mr. Lathrop, as well as all the\nother friends of the Chesters, anticipated it. But by slow degrees, the\narguments of her pastor, the hospital doctors, and the honest neighbors\nwho sympathized with the tortured mother, finally succeeded in bringing\nher to view the matter as they did.\n\n\"Not an effort shall be relaxed, any more than if you were on the spot\nto direct us. We all feel as if we, too, had lost a beloved child and\nnone of us will rest until this mystery is cleared. Trust the advice of\nall your best-wishers, Mrs. Chester, and take this fine chance offered\nyour lame husband to make the long journey under the care of his postman\nfriend,\" urged the minister, and his final argument procured her\nconsent.\n\n\"Oh! these last two days! Shall I ever forget them!\" cried Mrs. Chester,\nwhen Wednesday evening had arrived and she sat in her dismantled home\nupon one of her incoming tenant's chairs. \"To think that on Monday\nmorning, when you came, Mrs. Jones, I hadn't touched a single thing to\npack! and now--there isn't one left. All in boxes an' crates, over there\nto the station; me all alone; no Dorothy C.; no John--I'm just\nheart-broke!\"\n\nMrs. Jones's patience was tried. For these two busy days she and her\n\"Bill\" had stayed at No. 77, helping where help was needed, and keeping\na careful eye to the \"professional\" packing which they more than half\ndistrusted. The frail country-woman had just gone through the same sort\nof business, almost single-handed, and she felt that her new friend\nfailed to realize the blessings of her lot and that a reproof was in\norder.\n\n\"Well, Mis' Chester, you may be. I can't tell. I never had chick nor\nchild to make me sad or glad, ary one. But if I'd adopted one, right out\nof the streets as you did, an' she'd seen fit to run away an' turn her\nback on a good home, after enjoyin' it so long, an' I'd still got my\n_man_ left, an' folks had been that generous to me, payin' for\neverything--Laws! I sh'd think I had some mercies left. _Some._\"\n\nMother Martha rose. She was not offended, but she was deeply hurt and\nshe was glad the time had come to say good-bye. With a weary smile she\nheld out her hand, saying:\n\n\"Well, that's right, too, but you don't understand. Nobody can who\nhasn't lived with _Dorothy_. There was never a child like her. Never.\nI'll be going. I said good-bye to everybody--everything, this side the\ncity, and I've fixed it to sleep at a boarding house right across the\nstreet from the Hospital. We've got to make an early start and I'll be\nclose on hand. If she--O my darling!--Good-bye. I--I hope you'll be as\nhappy here as I was before all this trouble came upon me. No. I don't\nwant company. I want to be alone. It's the only way I can bear it\nand--good-bye, old home! Good-bye--good-bye!\"\n\nThe door opened and the mistress of the prettiest house on Brown Street\nvanished into the darkness of a somber, sultry night; and what her\nfeelings were only those who have thus parted with a beloved home can\nunderstand; and what the hours of sleeplessness which followed only she\nherself knew.\n\nThe morning found her sunshiny and bright, as if her whole heart were in\nthis sudden flitting, and waiting in the carriage at the hospital door,\nwhile an orderly and Mr. Lathrop, superintended by a nurse and doctor,\nhelped John Chester to make his first short journey upon crutches.\n\nThe excitement of the event had sent a flush to his cheeks and a\nbrightness to his eyes which made him look so like his old self that his\nwife rejoiced that, after all, there had been no delay in their removal.\nYet, once in the carriage, with his useless legs stretched out before\nhim, he suddenly demanded:\n\n\"Why, where's my girl? Where's Dorothy C.?\"\n\nHe looked toward his wife, but it was Mr. Lathrop who answered:\n\n\"Oh! she's coming later. We--we couldn't bother with a child, this\ntrip.\"\n\n\"Couldn't 'bother' with my Dorothy! Why, friend, you're the best I have,\nbut you don't know Dorothy. Humph! She's more brains in her curly head\nthan anybody in this party has in theirs. Beg pardon, all, but--but you\nsee I'm rather daft on Dorothy. I simply cannot go without her. What's\nmore, I shan't even try.\"\n\nThis was worse than they had expected. Martha had felt that her husband\nshould no longer be deceived as to the state of things; even in his\nweakened condition she believed that his good sense would support him\nunder their dreadful trial, and that he would suffer less if the news\nwere gently broken to him here than if he were left to learn it later,\nin some ruder way. But her judgment had been overruled even as now his\ndecision was; for without an instant's delay Mr. Lathrop ordered the\ncarriage to drive on and that memorable journey had begun.\n\nAs he was lifted out of the vehicle at the station entrance, he turned\nupon his wife and for the first time in her memory of him spoke harshly\nto her:\n\n\"Martha, you're deceiving me. Taking advantage of my helplessness.\nYou've always been jealous of my love for little Dorothy, and now, I\nsuppose, just because I can't work to support her you've got rid of her.\nWell, I shall have her back. I may be a cripple, but my brain isn't\nlame--it's only my legs--and I'll find some way to take care of her. She\nshall come back. Trust me. Now, go ahead!\"\n\nHe submitted to the porter and his friend Lathrop, and, the train just\nrolling in, he was carried through the gates and placed aboard it in the\nparlor car where seats had been procured. He had never before traveled\nin such luxury, but instead of the gay abandon with which he would once\nhave accepted and enjoyed it, he seemed now not to notice anything\nabout him. Except that, just as the train was moving out, he caught at a\nnewsboy hurrying from it, seized a paper, tossed a nickel, and spread\nthe sheet open on his knee.\n\nAlas! for all the over-wise precautions of his friends! The first words\nhis eyes rested upon were the scare-head capitals of this sentence:\n\n     THE FATE OF POSTMAN JOHN CHESTER'S DAUGHTER DOROTHY STILL\n     UNKNOWN--KIDNAPPING AND MURDER THE PROBABLE SOLUTION OF THE\n     MYSTERY.\n\nHe stared at the letters as if they had no significance. Then he read\nthem singly, in pairs, in dozens--trying to make his shocked brain\ncomprehend their meaning. The utmost he could do was to see them as\nletters of fire, printed on the air before him, and on the darkness of\nthe tunnel they now entered. A darkness so suggestive of the misery that\nhad shrouded a once happy household that poor Martha, burying her face\nin her hands, could only sob aloud.\n\nBut from the stricken \"father John\" came neither sob nor groan, for\nthere was still upon him the numbness of the shock he had received; and\nit was in that same silence that he made the long journey, with its\nseveral changes, and came at last to the farmhouse on the hilltop, which\nwas to have been made glad by a child's presence and was now so\ndesolate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nJIM BARLOW\n\n\nDorothy reread the note. Then she took off the scrawl attached to it and\ntore it into bits, remarking to the mastiff, or whoever might hear:\n\n\"Well, I don't want any milk. I shall never like it again. I believe\nthat dreadful man put something in it last night--was it only last\nnight?--that made me go to sleep and not know a thing was happening\nafter I got into the carriage till I woke up here. Milk! Ugh!\"\n\nWith a shudder of repulsion she looked over her shoulder just as a\nsibilant, warning \"S-Ssh!\" came from the room behind. Then she stood up\nand screamed as the mastiff, likewise rising, grasped her skirt in his\nteeth.\n\n\"Hush! you better not let her hear you!\" was the second, whispered\nwarning, and though she peered into the kitchen she could see nobody,\ntill, after a moment, she discovered a pair of dirty bare feet\nprotruding from under the bed that stood in one corner.\n\nDorothy was afraid of the dog that held her, but she was not usually\nafraid of human beings; so she called quite loudly:\n\n\"You long white boy, come out from that place. I want to talk to you!\"\n\nThe dog loosened its grip long enough to growl, then took a fresh hold,\nas the lad cautiously drew himself into full sight and noiselessly stood\nup. But he laid one grimy hand on his lips, again commanding silence,\nand snatching a big basket from the floor ran out of a rear door.\n\nThe girl tried to follow. Of the two human beings she had seen in this\nisolated cottage the long boy seemed the gentler, and she was determined\nto make him, or somebody, tell her where she was. The mastiff still held\nher prisoner and she suspected he was acting upon orders. Her temper\nrose and with it her courage. It was absurd that she could not do as she\npleased in a little bit of a country cottage like this, where there were\nno locks nor bolts to hinder! So for the third time she moved, and for\nthe third time the dog's great teeth set themselves more firmly on her\nlight clothing. Clenching her small hands in her impotent wrath, she\nbegan to screech and yell, at the top of her voice, incessantly,\ndeafeningly, defiantly. Pausing only long enough to renew her breath,\nand wondering if that old woman she could see yonder, picking berries\nfrom a bed, could endure the noise as long as she could endure to make\nit.\n\nApparently, the uproar had no further result than to tire her own\nthroat; for, until she had finished gathering the strawberries from one\nlong row of vines, the woman did not pause. But, having reached the\nlimit of the bed and of the crate she moved along before her as she\nworked, she suddenly stood up, lifted the crate to her head, and strode\nback to the house. There she deposited her precious fruit in an outer\nshed and entered the kitchen. From the small clock-shelf she gathered a\npad of writing paper, a bunch of envelopes, and a lead pencil; which\nwith an air of pride, and the first semblance of a smile Dorothy had\nseen upon her grim features, she offered to the child.\n\n\"Here. To write on. To your ma. He left 'em. Tige, let go!\"\n\nInstantly, the mastiff loosened his hold of Dorothy's skirts and\nfollowed his mistress into the strawberry patch whither she had again\ngone, carrying another crate filled with empty baskets. Evidently, this\nwas a truck-farm and the mistress of it was preparing for market. Just\nsuch crates and cups, or little baskets, were now plentiful at all the\ncity shops where groceries were sold, and Dorothy's hopes rose at the\nthought that she might be taken thither with this woman when she went to\nsell her stuff.\n\n\"Oh! that's what she'll let me do! So what's the use of writing? And how\nfine those berries look! I'd like to pick some myself. I'd rather do it\nthan do nothing. I'll just go and offer to help.\"\n\nIn better spirits than she would have thought possible, even a few\nmoments before, the homesick girl ran across the garden and to the\nwoman's side, who merely looked up and said nothing, till Dorothy\nlifted one of the wooden cups and began to pick fruit into it.\n\nFor a brief space the other watched her closely, as the nimble little\nfingers plucked the beautiful berries; till by mischance Dorothy pulled\noff an entire stem, holding not only ripened fruit but several green and\nhalf-turned drupes. Whereupon her fingers were smartly tapped and by\nexample, rather than speech, she was instructed in the art of berry\npicking.\n\n\"Oh! I do love to learn things, and I see, I see!\" cried the novice, and\nsmiling up into the old face now so near her own, she began the task\nafresh. Already the market-woman had resumed her own work, and it seemed\nincredible that such coarse fingers as hers could so deftly strip the\nvines of perfect berries only, leaving all others intact for a future\npicking. Also, she had a swift way of packing them in the cups that left\neach berry showing its best side and filled the receptacle without\ncrowding.\n\n\"Ah! I see! I'm getting the trick of it! And that's what mother means\nby paying for a quart and not getting a quart, isn't it? Oh! how\ndelicious they are!\" and, without asking, Dorothy popped the plumpest\nberry she had yet found into her own mouth.\n\nThat was a mistake, as the frown upon the woman's face promptly told\nher; and with a sudden sinking of her heart she realized again that she\nwas, after all, a prisoner in an unknown place. She rose, apologized in\na haughty manner, and would have retreated to the cottage again had she\nbeen permitted. But having proved herself of service, retreat was not so\neasy. Again she was pulled down to a stooping posture and her cup thrust\nback into her hand.\n\n\"Work. Eat spoiled ones. Don't dally.\"\n\nDorothy obeyed; but alas! her self-elected task grew very wearisome. The\nheat was still great and the afternoon sun shone full upon her back, and\nthere seemed positively no end to the berries. There were rows upon rows\nof them, and the woman had only just begun when Dorothy joined her. Or\nso it seemed, though there were already several crates waiting in the\nlittle shed till the full day's crop should be garnered.\n\nAt the end of one row of vines she stood up and protested:\n\n\"I can't pick any more. I'm so tired. Please tell me where I am and what\nyour name is. Tell me, too, when I can go home and the way.\"\n\n\"No matter. Go. Write. I'll take it. Here;\" and this big woman of small\nspeech held out on the palm of her great hand a half-dozen over-ripe\nberries, which Dorothy hesitated to accept, yet found delicious when she\ndid so.\n\n\"Thank you! and if you won't tell me who you are or where I am, I shall\ncall you Mrs. Denim, after the clothes you wear; and I shall find out\nwhere this farm is and run away from it at the first chance. I'd rather\nthat horrid old dog would eat me up than be kept a prisoner this way. Is\nthat long boy your son? May I go talk to him? May he show me the way\nhome to Baltimore?\"\n\nTo none of these questions was any answer vouchsafed, and offended\nDorothy was moved to remark:\n\n\"Humph! You're the savingest woman I ever saw! You don't waste even a\nword, let alone a spoiled strawberry. Oh! I beg your pardon! I didn't\nmean to be quite so saucy, but I'm almost crazy to go home. I want to go\nhome--_I want to go home_!\"\n\nThere was such misery in this wail that the long boy, weeding onions a\nfew feet away, paused in his tedious task and raised his shock head with\na look of pity on his face. But the woman seemed to know his every\nmovement, even though her own head was bowed above the vines, and shot\nhim such an angry glance that he returned to his weeding with no further\nexpression of his sympathy.\n\nPoor Dorothy C.! Homesickness in its bitterest form had come upon her\nand her grief made her feel so ill that she dropped down just where she\nwas, unable longer to stand upright. Instantly, she was snatched up\nagain by \"Mrs. Denim's\" strong arms and violently shaken. That anybody,\neven an ignorant stranger, should lie down in a strawberry patch and\nthus ruin many valuable berries was the height of folly! So, without\nmore ado, Dorothy was carried indoors, almost tossed upon the bed in the\nkitchen, and the paper and pencil thrown upon the patchwork quilt beside\nher. Then she was left to recover at her leisure, while whistling to\nTige to watch the girl, \"Mrs. Denim\" returned to her outdoor labors; nor\nwas she seen again till darkness had filled the narrow room.\n\nThen once again Dorothy was lifted and was now carried to a loft above\nthe kitchen, where, by the dim light of a tallow candle, she was shown a\nrude bed on the floor and a plate of food. Also, there was a bowl of\nmilk, but at this the girl looked with a shudder. She wasn't hungry, but\nshe reflected that people grew faint and ill without food, so she forced\nherself to nibble at the brown bread, which had been dipped in molasses,\ninstead of being spread with butter, and its sweetness gave her a great\nthirst. Slipping down the stairs, she found the pail and dipper and got\nher drink, and it was with some surprise that she did this unreproved.\n\nHowever, a snore from the bed explained why. \"Mrs. Denim\" was asleep\nand the \"long boy\" was invisible. At the foot of the stairs, Dorothy\nhesitated. Wasn't this a chance to steal away and start for home? Once\nout of this house and on some road, she would meet people who would\ndirect her. She had heard her father say, time and time again, that the\nworld was full of kindness; and, though her present circumstances seemed\nto contradict this statement, she was anxious to believe it true. But,\nas she stood there debating whether she dare run away in the darkness or\nwait until daylight, the sleepless Tiger gave a vicious growl and\nbounded in from the shed where he had lain.\n\nThat settled it. With a leap as swift as his own Dorothy sped back over\nthe stairs and flung herself on the \"shake-down\" where she had been told\nto sleep; and again silence, broken only by its mistress's snores, fell\nupon this lonely cottage in the fields.\n\nDorothy's own sleep was fitful. This low room under the eaves was close\nand warm. Her head ached strangely, and her throat was sore. At times\nshe seemed burning up with fever, and the next instant found herself\nshaking with the cold. She roused, at length, from one disturbed nap to\nhear the sound of wheels creaking heavily over rough ground, and to see\nthe attic dimly lighted.\n\n\"Can it be morning already? Is that woman going to market and not taking\nme, after all I begged her so?\" cried the girl aloud and, hurrying from\nthe bed to the low window, looked out.\n\nIt was the light of a late-rising moon that brightened the scene and\nthere was slowly disappearing in the distance one of those curious,\nschooner-shaped vehicles which truck-farmers use: and with a vain belief\nthat she could overtake it, Dorothy again rushed down the stairs and\nplump upon the mastiff crouched on the floor below, and evidently on\nguard.\n\nBut, yawning and stretching his long limbs, there just then entered the\nshock-headed youth; and his \"Pshaw!\" Dorothy's \"O-Oh!\" and Tiger's growl\nmade a trio of sounds in the silent house: to which he promptly added\nhis question:\n\n\"Huh? you awake?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! But I want to go with that woman! Call off the dog--I must\ngo--I _must_!\"\n\nThe boy did call the dog to him and laid his hand upon the creature's\ncollar; then he said:\n\n\"I'm glad of it.\"\n\n\"Glad that I'm left, you--horrid thing!\" cried Dorothy, trying to run\npast him and out of the door.\n\nBut she was not permitted, even had her own strength not suddenly\nforsaken her: for the lad put out his free hand and stopped her.\n\n\"Glad you're awake. So's we can talk,\" he said; and now releasing the\nmastiff, whom he bade: \"Lie down!\" he led her to the doorstep and made\nher sit down, with him beside her.\n\n\"So you _can_ talk, if you want to! I thought you were tongue-tied!\" she\nremarked, now realizing that the wagon had passed beyond reach, but\nthankful to have speech with anybody, even this silly-looking fellow.\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Jim. Jim Barlow. I hain't got no folks. All dead. I work for her,\" he\nanswered, readily enough, and she understood that it was only from fear\nhe had been so silent until now.\n\n\"Are you afraid of her? Do you mean 'her' to be that dreadful woman?\"\n\n\"Yep. She ain't so bad. She's only queer, and she's scared herself of\n_him_. What's yourn?\"\n\n\"My name, you mean? Dorothy Chester. Who's 'him'? Has 'she' gone to\nmarket? Does she go every market day? To Lexington, or Hollins, or\nRichmond--which? What's her name?\"\n\nJim gasped. His experience of girls was limited, and he didn't know\nwhich of these many questions to answer first. He began with the last:\nand now that he had the chance he seemed as willing to talk as Dorothy\nwas to listen. Apparently, neither of them now thought of the hour and\nits fitness for sleep: though Tiger had lain down before them on the\nflat stone step and was himself snoring, his need of vigilance past for\nthe time being. Said the boy:\n\n\"Stott. Mirandy Stott. Her man died. _He_ was a baby. She brung him\nup--good. She earned this hull truck-farm. She makes money. All for him\nan' he keeps her close. She sent him to school an' made a man of him.\nShe can't read nor write. She makes her 'mark,' but he can, the\nfirst-ratest ever was. I can, too, some. I'm learnin' myself. I'm goin'\nto school some time, myself, after I leave her.\"\n\n\"If you're going to school, I should think it was time you began. You're\na big boy,\" said Dorothy. \"Why don't you leave her now?\"\n\n\"Well--'cause. She--I come here when my folks died an' I hadn't no other\nplace. She treats me decent, only makes me hold my tongue. She hates\nfolks that talk. _He_ talks fast enough, though. So I--I've just stayed\non, a-waitin' my chance. I get good grub an' she don't lick me. She\nlikes me, I guess, next to him. She likes him better even than she likes\nmoney. I don't. I'm scared of him. So's she. She does what he says every\ntime. That's why I said 'no milk.'\"\n\n\"Who is 'he'? Does he live here? What is about the milk?\"\n\nThere was nobody anywhere near them except the dog. By no possibility\ncould anybody besides Dorothy hear the information next imparted: yet\nJim stood up, peered in every direction, and when he again sat down\nresumed in a whisper:\n\n\"You ain't the first one. 'Tother was a boy, real little. He cried all\nthe time, first off. Then 'he' fetched some white powders an' she put\n'em in the kid's milk. After that he didn't cry no more but he slept\nmost all the time. I seen her. I watched. I seen her put one in yourn. I\nliked you. I thought if you stayed you'd be comp'ny, if you was awake.\nThat's why.\"\n\n\"What became of the little boy?\" asked Dorothy, also whispering, and\nfrightened.\n\n\"He took him away. I studied out 't he gets money that way. He wouldn't\ndo it, 'less he did, seems if. I guess that's what he's plannin' 'bout\nyou. I'll watch. You watch. Don't mad her an' she'll treat you good\nenough. 'Less--'less he should tell her different. Then I don't know.\"\n\nDorothy sat silent for a long time. She was horrified to find her own\nsuspicions verified by this other person though he seemed to be\nfriendly; and her mind formed plan after plan of escape, only to reject\neach as impossible. Finally she asked:\n\n\"Where is this house? How far from Baltimore?\"\n\n\"'Bout a dozen mile, more or less. Ain't no town or village nigh. That's\nwhy she bought it cheap, the land laying away off that way. So fur is\nthe reason she has to have four mules, 'stead of two, for the\ntruck-wagon. She makes money! All for him. Him an' money--that's the\nhull of her.\"\n\n\"Say, Jim, do you like me? Really, as you said?\" demanded Dorothy, after\nanother period of confused thought, her brain seeming strangely dull and\nstupid, and a desire to lie down and rest greater, for the present, than\nthat for freedom.\n\n\"Course. I said so,\" he responded, promptly.\n\n\"Will you help me get away from here, back to my home? Listen. You told\nme about yourself, I'll tell about myself:\" and as simply as possible\nshe did so. Her story fell in exactly with his own ideas, that money was\nto be extorted for her restoration to her family, but his promise to\nhelp her was not forthcoming: and when he did not reply, she\nimpatiently exclaimed: \"You won't help me! You horrid, hateful wretch!\"\n\n\"Ain't nuther. Hark. One thing I know if I don't know another. I won't\nlie for nobody, even her or him. If I can--_if I can_--I'll help you,\nbut I ain't promisin' nothin' more. I'll watch out. You watch, an' _if I\ncan_, without makin' it worse for you, I will. Now I'm goin' to bed. You\nbest, too. She's found out you can work an' you'll have to. I've got\nplowin' to do. I sleep out yonder, in the shed. Tige, you stay where you\nbe.\"\n\nWithout further words, Jim retreated to his bunk in the shed and Dorothy\nto her attic. She was now conscious only of utter weariness and a\nracking pain through her whole body. She was, in fact, a very sick\ngirl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nDOROTHY'S ILLNESS\n\n\n\"Measles.\"\n\nThis was the one-word-verdict announced by Mrs. Stott's lips, as a few\nhours later, she stood beside the bed in the kitchen and sternly\nregarded the girl whom she had just brought from the attic and laid\nthere. She didn't look pleased, and poor Dorothy had never felt so\nguilty in her life--nor so wretched. Yet she plucked up spirit enough to\nretort:\n\n\"I didn't get them on purpose!\"\n\nThen she covered her eyes with her hands and fell to weeping,\nremembering mother Martha's tenderness whenever she had \"come down\" with\nany childish disease. Remembering, too, how father John had teased her\nabout being such a \"catcher.\" \"Such a sympathetic child nobody must have\nchicken pox, scarlatina, or even mumps, but you must share them! Well,\na good thing to get through all your childish complaints in your\nchildhood, and have done with them!\" Almost she could hear his dear\nvoice saying those very words and see the tender smile that belied their\njest. Oh! to feel herself lifted once more in his strong arms! and to\nknow that, no matter what was amiss with her, he never shrank from\nfondling or comforting her.\n\nThis woman did shrink, yet how could it be from fear of infection to\nherself? Besides, she made Jim stay wholly outside in the shed; and thus\nthe acquaintance begun during the night was suddenly suspended. Still,\nthough there was real consternation in her mind, the farm mistress was\nnot unkind. It may be that she felt the shortest way to a recovery was,\nalso, the least expensive one to herself; and immediately she went to\nwork upon her patient, after one more question:\n\n\"Know anybody had 'em?\"\n\n\"Yes. Lots. Half my class,\" answered Dorothy, defiantly.\n\n\"Hmm. Yes. Measles,\" commented Mrs. Stott, as she put on her sunbonnet\nand went out to rummage in her sage bed for fresh sprigs with which to\nmake a tea. This she forced Dorothy to drink, scalding hot; next she\ncovered her up with the heavy quilt, fastened the windows down, and\nordered Tige to take up his post beside the bed. Then she commanded:\n\"Stay in that bed. Get out, take cold, die. Not on my hands.\"\n\n\"Suppose she doesn't care if I do die on the hands of somebody else!\"\nreflected the patient, but said nothing aloud. Yet she watched the woman\ndo a strange thing--go to the door at the foot of the attic stairs, lock\nit, and put the key in her pocket. Then she went out of the cottage and\ntook Jim with her.\n\nLeft alone with the dog, Dorothy C. had many sad thoughts; but soon\nbodily discomfort banished her more serious anxieties and she became\nwholly absorbed in efforts to find some spot on that hard couch where\nshe might rest.\n\n\"I'll get up! I can't bear this heat!\" she cried, at last, and tossed\nthe heavy covers from her. But no sooner had she done so than a heavy\nchill succeeded and she crept back again, shivering. Thus passed the\nmorning and nobody came near; but at noon when the farm woman re-entered\nthe kitchen Dorothy's piteous plea was for \"Water! Water!\" and she had\nbecome oblivious to almost all else save the terrible thirst.\n\nWith the ignorance of her class the now really alarmed Mrs. Stott\nrefused the comforting drink, only to see her charge sink back in a\nstate of utter collapse; and, thereafter, for several days, the child\nrealized little that went on about her. On the few occasions when she\ndid rouse, she was so weakly patient that even the hard-natured woman\nwho nursed her felt her own heart softened to a sincere pity. Curiously,\ntoo, Tiger became devoted to her. He would stand beside the bed and lick\nthe wan hand that lay on the quilt, as if trying to express his\nsympathy; and his black, cool nose was grateful in her hot palm.\n\nMiranda Stott smiled grimly over this new friendship and, for the\npresent, did not interfere with it. Dorothy couldn't get away then, even\nwith the mastiff's connivance; but her hostess most heartily regretted\nthat the girl had ever come. She had perplexities of her own, now, which\nthis enforced guest and her illness greatly increased; and, as she\ngradually returned to strength, Dorothy often observed a deep frown on\nthe woman's face and, in her whole bearing, a strange attitude of\nlistening and of fear.\n\nOne afternoon, when Miranda and Jim were hard at work in the field\nbeyond the house and Dorothy still lay upon the bed, though for the\nfirst time dressed in her own clothes, which her nurse had found time to\nlaunder, the girl fancied that she heard a groan from somewhere.\n\n\"Why, Tige, what's that?\" she asked, half rising and listening intently.\n\nHe answered by a thump of his tail on the boards and his head turned\nsidewise, with his ears pricked up. Evidently, he, too, had caught the\nsound, and was puzzled by it.\n\nA moment later, Dorothy was certain she heard a movement of somebody in\nthe room overhead. There was but one, she knew, and it covered the\nentire width of the small house, for she had seen that during her brief\noccupation of it. Who could it be?\n\nHalf-frightened and wholly curious she crossed from the bed to the door\nand looked out. Yes, the two other inmates of the cottage were still in\nthe field, setting out celery plants, as she had heard them discussing\nat dinner.\n\nTiger kept close beside her and, now that she was upon her feet again,\nseemed doubtful whether he were to remain her friend or again become her\nwatchful enemy. She settled that question, however, by her loving pat on\nhis head and the smile she gave him. His attentions to her, while she\nhad lain so weak and helpless, had won her own affection and made her\nfeel that she would never again be afraid of any dog.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Stott looked round and saw the girl in the doorway. Then\nshe at once stood up, said something to Jim, and hurried to the house:\ndemanding, as she reached it and with evident alarm:\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\nDorothy smiled. She had been so dependent on this woman that she had\nlearned to really like her, and she answered brightly:\n\n\"Nothing but fancies, I reckon! I thought, Tiger, too, thought, we heard\nsomebody in the room upstairs. Then we came to the door and saw you were\nboth outdoors, so there couldn't have been, could there? You never have\nburglars in this out-of-the-way place, do you? My darling mother Martha\nis always looking out for them and there's none ever came. Oh! I'm so\nglad to be well, almost well, once more. You'll let me go home to her,\nwon't you? The very next time you go to market? I've been such a trouble\nI'm sure you'll be glad to be rid of me!\" and Dorothy impulsively caught\nat the woman's hand and kissed it.\n\nFor an instant Miranda Stott looked as if she could have been \"knocked\ndown with a feather.\" A kiss was as unknown and startling a thing to her\nas it was possible to imagine and it disconcerted her. But her answer\nwas:\n\n\"Yes, I'm glad too. I'll fetch a chair. Do you good.\"\n\nSo she caught up a chair in one strong hand, leaving a muddy impress\nupon it; and, seeing this, covered her other hand with her apron, then\nthrust it under Dorothy's arm and so piloted her out to the celery\npatch. There were no trees allowed to grow in that utilitarian spot,\nexcept here and there a fruit tree; and under the sparse shade of a\nslender plum-sapling Dorothy was made to sit, while Jim went on with his\ndropping of tiny seedlings into holes filled with water. Mrs. Stott had\ngone again to the house and for a moment the boy and girl were free to\ntalk, and all her own old interest in gardening returned. Besides, she\nwanted to learn all she could about it, so that she might be useful when\nshe, at last, got to that home \"in the country\" where they were all\ngoing so soon.\n\n\"Why do you do that, Jim?\" she asked, intently watching his long fingers\nstraighten the fine roots of the plants, then drop them into the\nprepared drill.\n\n\"Why, to make 'em grow. 'Cause it's the way,\" he answered, surprised\nthat anybody should ask such a foolish question.\n\n\"Oh, I see. You drill a place with a wooden peg, then you pour water\ninto it, then you plant the plant. Hmm. That's easy. I'll know how to\nmake our celery grow, too.\"\n\nJim looked up. \"Where's your celery at?\"\n\n\"I reckon it's 'at' a seed store, yet. 'Cause we haven't got there. Say,\nJim, were you afraid you'd 'catch' the measles? the reason why you\ndidn't come into the kitchen at all.\"\n\nThe lad laughed, slyly.\n\n\"No, I wasn't. She was, though. 'Cause I've had 'em. She didn't know an'\nI didn't tell her. Stayin' out in the barn I had time to myself. I\nlearned myself six more words. Hear me?\"\n\n\"Maybe I don't know them myself. Then I shouldn't know if you spelled\nthem right or wrong,\" she cautiously answered. \"If I had a book I'd hear\nthem, gladly.\"\n\nJim forgot that he was never expected to pause in any labor on hand and\nstood up: his thin body appearing to elongate indefinitely with surprise\nas he returned:\n\n\"Why--but _you've_ been to school! Anybody could hear 'em off a book. I\ncould hear 'em myself that way! Pshaw!\" and into this mild expletive he\nput such a world of contempt that Dorothy's cheeks tingled.\n\n\"Go ahead. Maybe I know them, but--you'd better work; Mrs. Stott is\ncoming.\"\n\nThe woman was, indeed, almost upon them and listening suspiciously to\nwhat they might be saying; and though there was scorn in her expression\nthere was also relief. She couldn't understand what any farm hand needed\nof \"book learning,\" but it sounded harmless enough when Jim pronounced\nthe word: \"Baker. B-a-k-e-r, baker,\" and the girl applauded with a clap\nof her hands and the exclamation: \"Good! Right! Fine! Next!\"\n\nBack on his knees again, the lad cast a sheepish glance toward his\nemployer, as if asking her permission to continue. She did not forbid\nhim, so he went on with: \"Tinker. T-i-n, tin, k-e-r, ker, tinker.\"\n\nAgain Dorothy commended him and was thankful that her own knowledge was\nsufficiently in advance of his that she should not be put to\nshame--\"without a book.\" Also, by the time the ambitious youth had\nrecited his new lesson of six words, in their entirety, both he and\nDorothy were in a fine glow of enthusiasm. She, also, loved study and\nfound it easy; and she longed with all her heart that she could put\ninside this Jim's head as much as she already learned.\n\nThen he was sent away to attend to the cattle for the night, to see that\nthe market-wagon was again packed, and to put all utensils safely under\ncover. Because she could afford no waste, or thought she couldn't,\nMiranda Stott took better care of her farm implements than most farmers\ndid; and if indoors there was much to be desired in the way of neatness,\nout-of-doors all was ship-shape and tidy. She finished the celery\nplanting herself, and Dorothy wondered if there were people enough in\nthe world to eat all those plants, after they were grown. Then Miranda\ntook the chair from Dorothy and said:\n\n\"Come, I want my bed again. I'll fix you outside.\" And as if some\nfurther explanation were needed, added: \"It's healthier. You've got to\nget well, quick.\"\n\n\"Oh! I want to. I am, almost, already. It is so good to be out of doors,\nand--are you going to take me home, to-night, when you drive in?\"\n\n\"No. Take letter. See?\" answered this laconic woman, and led the girl\ninto the barn and into what had been a small harness-room partitioned\nfrom one side. This had, evidently, been prepared for occupation and\nthere was a suspicious air of wisdom on Jim's face, as Dorothy passed\nhim, fastening the cattle-stanchions, betraying that this barn bedroom\nwas a familiar place to him.\n\n\"Why, it is a bedroom! If the bed is only a pile of hay! There are\nsheets on it and a pillow and a blanket. My! It smells so sweet and\noutdoor-sy!\" cried Dorothy, thinking how much more restful such a couch\nwould be than that hot feather bed in the kitchen, on which she had lain\nand tossed.\n\n\"Yours. Stay here now. Jim'll bring your supper, and a chair. Fetch the\npaper, boy,\" she concluded, as he departed for the cellar under the\ncottage which was used for a dairy.\n\nThen Mrs. Stott went away, Tiger nestled up to her--as if offering his\nsociety--and the still weak girl dropped down on the sweet-smelling bed\nand felt almost happy, even though still refused a return home.\n\n\"Well, it's something to be let to write to mother. I was so sick I\nhaven't done it often; but if, as that Mr. Smith said, she knew I was\nsafe she won't worry much. Not so very much. But, oh! How I want her,\nhow I want her!\"\n\nThe farm-mistress herself brought back the chair and paper, and waited\nwhile Jim followed with the supper of bread and cold meat. He added a\npitcher of water without bidding, and, supposing him to have finished,\nhis mistress left the place. Indeed, she seemed so changed and\npreoccupied that Dorothy wondered and pitied. Her own sorrows were\nteaching her the divine gift of compassion, and though she was this\nwoman's prisoner she longed to share and soothe the distress she was so\nevidently suffering.\n\nBut she dared not. With a gesture of despair, Mrs. Stott suddenly threw\nboth hands outward, then hurried away into the cottage, leaving the boy\nand girl staring after her. Even Jim did not tarry, though he longed to\ndo so; yet he managed to whisper, in his own mysterious fashion:\n\n\"It's _him_. He's got 'em. They're goin' hard--he's old.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE PLUMBER AND HIS GOSSIP\n\n\nThe eagle-gate was open again. Mrs. Cecil had recovered from her\nillness, and was once more upon her broad piazza. This time she was not\nawaiting the arrival of the postman but of the plumber. The sudden heat\nof the southern city reminded her of her northern home in the highlands\nand she was anxious to remove there as soon as possible. But, with true\nMaryland housewifery, she must personally see to all the details of the\nannual flitting.\n\nIn every room of the house pictures were being swathed in tarletan,\nchandeliers wrapped in the same stuff, carpets lifted, furniture put\ninto freshly starched slips, and the entire interior protected to the\nutmost against the summer's dust and fading. Only one matter did not\nprogress as rapidly as this impatient little mistress of the mansion\nfelt it should. Nobody came at her instant command to examine the\nplumbing and see that it was in order for the season.\n\n\"And water makes more trouble than even flies. Dinah, girl! Are you sure\na message was sent to that man how I was waiting?\"\n\n\"Posi_tive_-ly sho, Miss Betty. Laws, honey, don't go worritin' yo'se'f\nan' you-all jus' done gettin' ovah yo' misery. He'll be comin' erlong,\nbime-by,\" comforted the maid, officiously folding a shawl about Mrs.\nCecil's shoulders, and having the shawl instantly tossed aside, with a\ngesture of disgust.\n\n\"O you girl! Do stop fussing about me. I'm nearly suffocated, already,\nin this awful heat, and I won't--I won't be wrapped up in flannel, like\na mummy. You never had any sense, Dinah!\"\n\n\"Yas'm. I 'low dat's so, Miss Betty. Mebbe on account you-all nevah done\nbeaten me ernough. Yas'm, but I doan 'pear to be acquainted wid er\nmummy, Miss Betty. What-all be dey like?\" And with imperturbable good\nnature, Dinah picked up the shawl and again placed it around her lady,\nwho permitted it to remain without further protest.\n\n\"Hmm. No matter what they're like, Dinah. But you know, girl, you know\nas well as I do what trouble it made for us last year, when we went away\nand forgot to have the water turned off from the fountain, yonder. That\ncare-taker we left--Oh! dear! Is there anybody in this world fit to be\ntrusted!\"\n\nMrs. Cecil was not yet as strong as she professed to be, but her\nweakened nerves seemed to add strength to her temper. A red spot was\nalready coming out upon her pale cheeks when there sauntered through the\ngateway a corpulent man, with a kit of plumber's tools over his\nshoulder. He slowly advanced to the steps, lifted his hat, and, bowing\ncourteously, said:\n\n\"Good-morning, Mrs. Cecil. Glad to see you able to enjoy the fine\nweather.\"\n\n\"Fine weather! Morning! I should think it was afternoon--by the way\nyou've kept me waiting. Didn't you get my message?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I did. A pickaninny about as big as a button brought it.\nWhat's to be done? The usual shutting-off, Ma'am?\"\n\n\"Everything's to be done, this year, and thoroughly. The water made no\nend of trouble last season, for half the faucets weren't looked after.\nAs soon as we got home in the fall and turned it on in the bathroom, the\nwhole place was flooded.\"\n\n\"So, so? That was a pity. Yes, I remember. Well, it shall be gone over\nnow, and I promise you nothing shall happen. By the way, all my men were\nout. Can one of your 'boys' wait on me and hand me my tools? I'm kind of\nstout and stooping bothers----\"\n\nShe didn't wait for him to finish his sentence. A small black boy was\nthrowing stones at the sparrows on the lawn, and him she summoned by the\nabsurd title of:\n\n\"Methuselah Bonaparte Washington, come wait on this man!\"\n\nThe poor little wizened specimen of humanity, whose mighty name seemed\nto have stunted his growth, timidly approached. His great dark eyes\nwere appealingly lifted, as if protesting against a forthcoming blow,\nand his face was as sad as that of a weary old man. The sight of him\namused the plumber and called forth from his mistress the question:\n\n\"Did anybody ever see such a woe-begone infant? He acts as if he had\nbeen thrashed within an inch of his life and on every day of it, but I\nknow he's never been struck once. Been better for him if he had been,\nlikely. He's Ephraim's grandchild and petted to death. His grandfather\ngave him his first name, Dinah his second, and as a graceful finish I\ntucked on the last. In real fact he's simply Brown.\"\n\nMrs. Cecil had now quite recovered her usual cheerfulness, which nothing\ngreatly affected except the failure of other people to instantly obey\nher commands. Besides, she was lonely. She didn't like the postman who\nhad taken \"Johnnie's\" place, and was never on hand when he appeared,\nindeed had not been able until now. Almost all her personal friends were\nalready out of town: and with her old desire to hear about her\nneighbors, as well as a determination to look after the plumber's work\nthis time, she rose and followed him into the house and to the upper\nfloor where his examination of the spigots began.\n\nMr. Bruce had worked at Bellevieu ever since he was an apprentice and\nhad not done so without learning something of its mistress's character.\nSo, to please her love of gossip, he turned to where she had taken a\nchair to watch him and remarked:\n\n\"Terrible sad thing about John Chester's girl.\"\n\n\"'Girl'? Servant, do you mean?\" instantly interested by the name of\n\"Chester.\"\n\n\"Servant? Oh! no. That's a luxury my neighbor never had, nor any of us\nin Brown Street, except when somebody was sick. We're work-a-day folks\non my block, Mrs. Cecil.\"\n\n\"Humph. What do you mean, then, by 'girl'?\"\n\n\"His adopted daughter, Dorothy C. Haven't you seen about her in the\npaper?\" he continued, well pleased that he had found some topic\ninteresting to his employer.\n\n\"No. I've seen no papers. I've been ill, or that foolish doctor said I\nwas, which amounts to the same thing. Anyway, I hardly ever do read the\npapers in the summer time. There's never anything in them--with\neverybody out of town, so.\"\n\nThe plumber laughed, a trifle grimly; answering with some spirit:\n\n\"Well, _everybody_ isn't away, when there are several hundred people\nswelter all the hot season right here in Baltimore.\"\n\n\"Why don't they go away? Why do they 'swelter'--such a horrid word that\nis!\" returned the lady, more to calm a strangely rising flutter of her\nown spirits than because there was sense in the words; which sounded so\nfoolish to herself even, that she laughed. But her laugh was a nervous\none and was instantly followed by the inquiry:\n\n\"What--what happened to the child?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows. Kidnapped, I suppose, or murdered. All _is_ known--she\nwas sent to the post-office to get a letter of her father's. He couldn't\ngo himself, being lame and off to a hospital. Letter was one like the\nrest that came every month, and had come ever since Dorothy was left on\nthe Chesters' doorstep. There was ten dollars in it, likely. She got the\nletter, was seen to go out of the office, and has never been seen since.\nNo trace of her, either, though the post-office 'boys' clubbed together\nand offered a reward. A hundred dollars for any information sent,\nwhether dead or alive. Do you want both these spigots to have new\nwashers on? They need it, I think.\"\n\n\"Spigots? Spigots?\" repeated Mrs. Cecil, as if she did not comprehend;\nand, looking up, the plumber saw to his surprise and alarm that the lady\nwas trembling and had turned very pale. He went to her and asked:\n\n\"Feeling bad, Ma'am? Shall I call somebody?\"\n\nShe put her white hand to her head in a confused way and returned:\n\n\"Bad? It's horrible! Horrible! A--_hundred_--_dollars_!\"\n\nMr. Bruce fancied she imagined the sum to be too large and was\nindignant. He reflected, also, that this was a childless old woman, and\na rich one. In his experience he had found the wealthy also the most\nmiserly, and nobody who had not a daughter of her own could understand\nwhat the loss of one might mean to a parent. His own beloved Mabel, ill\nat that moment with the measles, then epidemic--what would life be worth\nwithout her? Yet he knew, as well as anybody, that dear as his child\nwas, Dorothy had been infinitely her superior in way of appearance,\nintelligence, even in affection. So much greater her loss then! and with\na crispness that might easily hurt his business, he demanded:\n\n\"Do you think a hundred dollars too much to pay for the life of a\nchild?\"\n\n\"Too much? _Too--much!_\"\n\nAgain she was repeating his words, in that peculiar manner which might\nmean either contempt or admiration. In any case she was acting\nstrangely. She had evidently lost all interest in the business on hand,\nyet there was no suggestion of feebleness in the step with which she now\nhurried out of the room, and the plumber looked after her in fresh\namazement. These idle people! How hard they were to be understood! But,\nin any case, he was glad to be rid of the lady's presence. He could work\nso much faster and better by himself, and if there were any harm to\nBellevieu, that coming season of its owner's absence, it should not be\nhis fault. There shouldn't be an inch of water-pipe, nor a single\nfaucet, that didn't have his critical inspection--and bill according!\n\nMrs. Cecil's bell rang sharply, and Dinah hurried to answer it, that is,\nshe fancied she was hurrying, though her mistress knew she really\n\"dawdled\" on the way and so informed \"the creature\" as she appeared.\n\n\"Oh, you lazy thing! I must get a younger woman--I certainly must!\nDidn't you hear me ring?\"\n\n\"Yas'm, I sho done did. An' I come, ain't I? What's wantin', Miss Betty?\nIs yo' feelin' po'ly again, honey?\"\n\n\"Tell Ephraim to have the carriage round within five minutes--not one\ninstant later. Then come back and get me my outdoor things.\"\n\n\"Yas'm. Dat's so. I ain't no younger 'n I was yestiddy. But what for\nyou-all done want Ephraim fotch de kerridge? Yo' know, Miss Betty, I\nain't gwine let yo' out ridin', yet a spell. Yas'm.\"\n\n\"Will _you_ tell him or must _I_? Between you and that wretched doctor\nI've been kept in this terrible ignorance. I'll never forgive you,\nnever, for shutting me up in my bedroom, unknowing all these days, until\nnow it's too late! Too late!\" cried Mrs. Cecil, strangely excited and\nhastily tossing off her morning gown to replace it by another fit for\nthe street.\n\nDinah was unperturbed. She understood that her mistress would have her\nwill, but felt that it was a foolish one and should not be encouraged by\nany enthusiasm on her own part. With an exasperating calmness she lifted\nthe discarded garment and carried it to a closet. From this with equal\ncalmness, and an annoying deliberation, she brought her mistress's\noutside wraps and a black silk gown, such as she usually wore when\ndriving out. But she purposely made the mistake of offering a winter\none, heavily lined. She hoped that the \"fuss\" of dressing would change\nMrs. Cecil's plans, for it was really far too warm to go out then. Later\nin the day, after the sun had set, she would help the scheme most\nwillingly.\n\nBut the gentlewoman was now gaining control of her nerves and fully\nunderstood that it was over-affection, rather than disobedience, which\nmade Dinah act so provokingly. With one of her kindest smiles, she took\nthe heavy gown back to the closet herself, and secured the lighter one\nsuitable to the day. Then she explained:\n\n\"It's no silly whim, my girl, that sends me down town on such a hot\nmorning. Something serious has happened. Something which has just come\nto my knowledge and that I must try to set right at once. If you love\nme--help me, not hinder. You are to go with me, also. So, hurry and put\non a fresh apron and cap. I can finish by myself.\"\n\n\"Yas'm. But yo' knows, honey, you-all only done lef yo' bed a speck o'\ntime. Cayn't yo' business be put off, Miss Betty?\"\n\n\"Not a minute. Not one single minute longer than necessary to take me to\nBaltimore Street. Hurry. Fix your own self. Don't bother about me.\"\n\n\"Yes'm. I'se gwine hu'y. But dat yere plumber gempleman--what erbout\nleabin' him, to go rummagin' 'round, puttin' new fixin's in whe' ol'\nones do? Ain't you-all done bettah wait a little spell, an' 'tend to\nhim, yo'se'f? Hey, Miss Betty?\"\n\nDinah had touched upon her mistress's own regret, but a regret swallowed\nby so much of a calamity that she put it aside and merely pointed to the\ndoor, as if further speech were useless.\n\nIt was more than five minutes before Ephraim drove his well-groomed\nhorses out of the eagle-gate, but it was in a very short time for one\nwho moved as slowly as he, and he turned his head for orders, with\nexpectation of: \"The Park.\"\n\nQuite to the contrary the word was:\n\n\"Baltimore Street. Kidder & Kidder's.\"\n\n\"Hey? 'D you say Eutaw Place, er Moun' Ver'n Avenoo?\" he inquired.\n\n\"There, boy. You're not half so deaf as you pretend. Drive to Kidder &\nKidder's, and do it at once,\" she repeated with decision.\n\n\"Yas'm. But does yo' know, Miss Betty, erbout a man was sunstroke\nyestiddy, Baltimo' Street way? It sutenly is pow'ful wa'm.\"\n\nMrs. Cecil vouchsafed no further parley with her too devoted coachman,\nthough Dinah took it upon herself to administer one reproof which her\nfellow servant coolly ignored.\n\nHowever, he had seen that in Mrs. Cecil's eye which brooked no\ndisobedience, and so he guided his bays southward through the city, by\nwide thoroughfares and narrow, past crowding wagons and jangling street\ncars, till he turned into the densely packed street his lady had\ndesignated.\n\n\"Kidder & Kidder\" were her men of business. He knew that. There had been\nno time, for years upon years, when a firm of this same name had not\nserved the owners of Bellevieu. The first lawyer of that race had handed\ndown the business to his heirs, as the first tenant of the rich estate\nhad willed that to his. But it was now more common for the lady of the\nmansion to send for her advisers to visit her, than for her to visit\nthem; and that there was something unusual in her present business both\nher old servitors realized.\n\nIt was something worth while to see how the elder Mr. Kidder, himself an\noctogenarian, retaining an almost youthful vigor, rose and salaamed, as\nthis beautiful old gentlewoman, followed by her gray-haired maid in\nspotless attire, entered his rather dingy office. How the old-time\ncourtesies were exchanged between these remnants of an earlier society,\nwhen brusqueness was considered ill-bred and suavity the mark of good\nblood.\n\nA few such greetings past, and the old lawyer conducted his\ndistinguished client into an inner room, exclusively his own, leaving\nDinah to wait without, and whence the pair soon emerged; the lady\nurging: \"You will kindly attend to it at once, please;\" and he\nanswering, with equal earnestness: \"Immediately, Madam.\"\n\nThen he escorted her to her carriage and stood bareheaded while she\nentered it: each courteously saluting the other as it rolled away, and\nhe returning to his office with a look of anxiety on his fine face, as\nthere was one of relief on hers.\n\n\"Well, I've done the best I could--now!\" she exclaimed, after a time.\n\"I've never entrusted any matter to Kidder & Kidder that did not end\nsatisfactorily. That old firm is a rock in the midst of this shifting\nmodernity!\"\n\nTo which Dinah, not comprehending, replied with her usual:\n\n\"Yas'm. I spec' dat's so, honey, Miss Betty.\"\n\nThat evening both Ephraim and the maid, sitting under their own back\nporch, exchanged speculations concerning their lady's morning trip, and\nher subsequent quietude during the whole day.\n\n\"I 'low 'twas anudder will, our Miss Betty, she done get made. Dat's\nwhat dem lawyer gentlemen is most inginerally for. How many dem wills\nhas she had writ, a'ready, Dinah?\" queried Ephraim.\n\n\"Huh! I doan' know. Erbout fifty sixty, I reckon. She will her prop'ty\noff so many times, dey won' be nottin lef to will, bimeby. 'Twas dat,\nthough, Ephraim, I 'low, too. Mebbe--Does dey put erbout makin' wills in\nde papahs, boy?\"\n\n\"I doan' know. Likely. Why, Dinah?\"\n\n\"Cayse, warn't no res' twel Miss Betty done sent yo' Methusalem out to\nde drug-sto' fo' to buy de ebenin' one. Spec' she was lookin' had Massa\nKiddah done got it printed right. Doan' know what she want o' papahs,\nwhen she ain't looked at one this long spell, scusin 'twas to find out\ndat.\"\n\nBut neither of them guessed that Mrs. Cecil's interest lay in a\nlarge-typed advertisement, offering five hundred dollars reward for the\nreturn of the lost, humble little Dorothy C. Nor that this sum would\nhave been twice as great, had not the worldly wisdom of Kidder & Kidder\nbeen larger than that of their aristocratic client.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE BITER BIT\n\n\nEven healthy Dorothy had rarely slept as soundly as she did that night,\nthere in the airy barn on her bed of hay; and she had lain down as soon\nas she had finished her brief letter to her mother--which like those\nthat had gone before it would travel no further than Mrs. Stott's range\nfire.\n\nShe woke in the morning to find it much later than usual when she was\nroused and that it was only Jim who was calling her. He did so softly,\nyet with evident excitement; and as soon as possible the girl got out of\nher hostess's too big nightgown and into her own clothes, still fresh\nfrom yesterday's laundering. Then she opened the door and ran to the\ntrough of water, used for the cattle; and after a liberal ducking of her\ncurly head, shook herself dry--for want of a better towel. Afterwards,\nto the barnyard, calling eagerly:\n\n\"Jim! O Jim!\"\n\n\"Here I be. Don't holler. I'll come, soon's I take the milk in. I\nthought you'd sleep till doomsday!\" he replied, still in a low tone, yet\nwith less caution than he usually displayed.\n\nShe sat down on the barn door sill and waited. She had a strong\nreluctance to enter the cottage which was tightly closed and where she\nhad so greatly suffered. So that it was with real delight she saw the\nlad was bringing a plate with him, as he returned, and guessed it to be\nher breakfast.\n\n\"Oh! how nice! I'll love to picnic out here, but how does it happen?\nand, Jim, what makes you so sober? Is--is she sick? Didn't she go to\nmarket last night? Tell--talk--why can't you? I want to hear everything,\nevery single thing. I didn't know--I went to sleep--What a funny wagon\nit is, anyway!\"\n\nThe big vehicle stood in the yard before them, its shafts resting on the\nground; and the four mules used to draw it were feeding in the pasture\nbeyond. Dorothy thought it wonderful how anybody, most of all a woman,\ncould drive four mules, as Miranda did, without reins to guide them, yet\nmake them so obedient to her will. The wagon, also, was a curiosity to\nher, though she had often seen similar ones on the streets at home.\n\nIt was a large affair, rising several feet upwards from its box, its\nends projecting; forward over the dashboard and, at the rear, backward\nbeyond a step and a row of chicken crates. The top was of canvas, that\nhad once been white, and the tall sides were half of a brick-red, half\nof bright blue. Its capacity was enormous, and so prolific was the\ntruck-farm that it was always well filled when it made its city trips.\n\n\"Have you had your breakfast, too, Jim?\" asked Dorothy, rather\ncritically inspecting hers, which did not at all suggest the dainty\ncooking of mother Martha.\n\n\"Yep. All I wanted. He--I reckon he's powerful sick.\"\n\n\"Can't you sit down by me for company? I feel so good this morning. I'd\nlike somebody to talk to.\"\n\n\"A minute, maybe. I can make it up later.\"\n\n\"Jim Barlow, I think you're a splendid boy. I never saw anybody so\nfaithful to such a horrid old woman. You never waste a bit of time, you\nonly study when you ought to sleep, and yet--yet I didn't like you at\nall when I first saw you. When I get home and my father gets well, I'm\ngoing to tell him or the minister all about you, and ask them to get you\na better place. To send you to school, or do anything you like.\"\n\nThe lad flushed with pleasure, and vainly tried to keep the bare feet of\nwhich he was so conscious out of sight in the hay upon the barn floor,\nwhere, for this brief moment, he dared to linger. Dorothy saw the\nmovement and laughingly thrust forth her own pink toes, fresh from an\nablution in the trough, and from which she had had to permanently\ndiscard her ragged ties.\n\n\"That's nothing. We're both the same. Anyway, a barefooted boy came to\nbe president! Think of that. President James Barlow, of the United\nStates! I salute you, Excellency, and request the honor of your sharing\nmy brown-bread-and-treacle!\"\n\nThen she laughed, as she had not done for many days; from the sheer\ndelight of life and the beautiful world around her. For it was\nbeautiful, that first June day, despite the ugly cottage which blotted\nthe landscape and the sordid implements of labor all about.\n\nTo his own amazement, the orphan farm boy laughed with her, as he did\nnot know he could, as he surely never had before. This girl's coming had\nopened a new world to him. She had commended his ambition and made light\nof the difficulties in way of its achievement. She had assured him that\n\"learning is easy as easy!\" and she knew such a lot! She didn't scorn\nhim because he was uncouth and ill-clad; and--Well, at that moment he\nwas distinctly glad that she was barefooted like himself.\n\nRecklessly forgetting that he was \"using the time I was hired for\"--the\nhire being board and lodging, only--he dropped down on the step and\nwatched as she ate, so daintily that he could think of nothing but the\nsparrows on the ground. And as she ate she also talked; which in itself\nwas wonderful. For he--Well, he couldn't talk and eat at the same time.\nIt was an accomplishment far beyond him, one that had never been taught\nat the table of Miranda Stott. She not only chattered away but she made\nhim chatter, too, now, in this unwonted freedom from his mistress's eye.\n\n\"Who's 'him'? Why, he's _hern_,\" he explained. \"Her son, you know.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know. I know nothing--except that I'm a stolen little girl\nwho's lost everybody, everything in the world she loves!\" cried poor\nDorothy, suddenly overcome in the midst of her gayety by the thought of\nher own sorrows.\n\nJim had never known girls and their ways, but he had the innate\nmasculine dread of tears, and by the look of Dorothy's brown eyes he saw\nthat tears portended. To change the subject, he answered her question\ndefinitely:\n\n\"He's the man what brought you here. _That's_ him. He's _hern_.\"\n\n\"That man--_Smith_? He here? In the cottage yonder? Then--_good-bye_!\"\n\nReckless of the sharp stones and stubble of the barnyard that so cruelly\nhurt her tender feet, the girl was up and away; only to find herself\nrudely pulled back again and to hear Jim's familiar:\n\n\"Pshaw! He can't harm you none. He's dreadful sick. He come----\"\n\nHere the lad paused for some time, pondering in his too honest heart how\nmuch of his employer's affairs he had the right to make known, even to\nthis Dorothy. Then having decided that she already knew so much there\ncould be no danger in her learning more, he went on:\n\n\"He come one night whilst you was so sick. She fetched him in the wagon\nan', 'cause you was in her bed, she put him up-attic, in yourn. Ain't\nbut them two rooms, you know, an' the shed where I did sleep but don't\nnow. I don't know what he'd done but--somethin' 't made him scared of\nstayin' in the city. He's been that way afore an' come out here, 'to\nrest' he called it. 'To hide,' seems if, to me. 'Cause he'd never go out\ndoor, till me or his ma'd look round to see if anybody was comin'.\nNobody does come. Never did, only them he fetched, or her did.\"\n\nAgain a shudder of fear and repulsion swept over Dorothy, and again she\nwould have run away but Jim's next words detained her.\n\n\"He can't move, hair ner hide. He's ketched them measles offen you an'\nhe's terrible bad. She thinks he's goin' to die an', queer, but now she\ndon't care for nothin' else. Her sun's riz an' sot in him, an' he's\ntreated her mean. Leastways, _I_ call it mean. She don't. She'd 'bout\nlie down on the floor an' let him tramp all over her, if he'd wanted to.\nShe's goin' round, doin' things inside there, but she's clean forgot how\nit's berry-day agin an' the crop wastin'.\n\n\"So 'm _I_ wastin' time, an' she claims that's money. I didn't know,\nafore, whuther 'twas him er money she liked best, but now I guess it's\nhim. If you was a mind you could help pick berries for her. _If you was\na mind_,\" said Jim, rising and shouldering a crate of cups, then\nstarting for the strawberry patch.\n\nDorothy C. looked after him with some contempt. He seemed a lad of\nmighty little spirit. To work like a slave even when there was nobody to\ndomineer over him! Indeed, she fancied that he was even more diligent in\nbusiness now than he had been before. It was very strange.\n\n\"It's all strange. Life's so strange, too. They say 'Providence leads.'\nWell, it seems a queer sort of leading that I should be sent to do an\nerrand and then that I should be so silly as to go with a man my folks\ndidn't know--and get stolen. That's what I am, now: just a stolen child,\nof no use to anybody. Why? Why, too, should my father John be let to get\nan 'ataxious' something in his legs, so he had to lose his place? And\nmother Martha have to give up her pretty house she loves so, and go away\noff to the country where she doesn't know anybody? Why should I come\nhere to this old truck-farm and a horrid woman and a horrider man and\nget the measles and give them to him? Was it just to learn how to plant\nthings? I wondered about that the time I watched them do the celery.\nWell, I could learn so much out of books. I needn't be kidnapped to do\nit! And why on earth should I feel so sorry now for that woman in there?\nJust 'cause she loves her son, who's the wickedest man I ever heard of.\nAnd that Jim boy! I--I believe I'm going to hate him! Just positively\nhate. He makes me feel so--so little and mean. Just as if I hadn't a\nright to sit on this old barn door sill and do nothing but eat my\nbreakfast. A horrid breakfast, too, to match the horrid woman and the\nhorrid house and the horrider man, and the horridest-of-all-boys, Jim!\"\n\nWith that Dorothy's cogitations came to a sudden end. No poor\ninsignificant farm lad should put her to shame, in the matter of\nconscience, or generosity, or honor, or any other of those disagreeable\nhigh-sounding things! She'd show him! and she'd pick those old\nstrawberries, if her back did get hot and the sun make her head ache! No\nsuch creature as that Jim Barlow should make her \"feel all\nwiggley-woggley inside,\" as she had used to feel when she had been real\nsmall and disobeyed mother Martha.\n\nWhy she shouldn't run away and try to find her home, now that Mrs. Stott\nwas out of sight, puzzled even herself. Yet, for some reason, she dared\nnot. She had no idea of the direction in which that home lay, and there\nwas no house visible anywhere, strain her eyes as she might to discover\none at which she might ask protection.\n\nThe truck-farm seemed to be away off, \"in the middle of nowhere.\" A\ncrooked lane ran northward from it and Dorothy knew that this must\nstrike a road--somewhere. But dear old Baltimore must be miles and miles\ndistant; since Mrs. Stott spent so many hours in going to and from it\nwith her produce, and in her bare feet the child felt she couldn't make\nthe journey and endure. More than that, down deep in her heart was a\nkeen resentment of the fact that, despite her own letters written and\nsent by the farm-woman, mother Martha had made no response beyond that\nverbal one conveyed by \"Mr. Smith,\" that everything was \"all right\" and\nthat, in the prospect of gaining her \"fortune\" Dorothy was wise to\nsubmit to some unpleasant things for the present.\n\nThen would arise that alternate belief that she had been \"kidnapped,\"\nand instantly following would come the conviction that she might be much\nworse dealt with if she attempted escape. If \"Mr. Smith\" was wicked\nenough to steal her, as she in this mood believed, he would stop at\nnothing which would save himself from discovery and punishment.\n\nJim Barlow was tormented by none of these shifting moods. His nature was\nsimple and held to belief in but two things--right and wrong. He must do\nthe one and avoid the other. This necessity was born in him and he could\nnot have discussed it in words, or even thoughts, as did the imaginative\nDorothy C. the questions that perplexed her.\n\nAt that particular moment he knew that the \"right\" for him was to save\nhis employer's berries from decay, even though this meant no reward for\nhim save a tired back and a crust of bread for dinner. But rewards\ndidn't matter. Jim _had_ to do his duty. He couldn't help it.\n\nNow Dorothy watching from the barn doorway saw this and thought that\n\"duty\" was \"the hatefullest word in the English language. It always\nmeans something a body dislikes!\" Yet, so strong is example, that almost\nbefore she knew it the little girl had picked her gingerly way over the\nrough ground to the lad's side and had petulantly exclaimed:\n\n\"Give me some cups then! I hate it! I hate here! I--I want to go home!\nBut--_give me some cups_!\"\n\nJim didn't even notice her petulance. He handed her a pile of \"empties\"\nand went on swiftly gathering the berries without even raising his head,\nthough one long hand pointed to the row upon which she should begin. He\nwas pondering how these same berries were to be marketed; whether the\nanxious woman in the cottage loved money so well she would leave a\npossibly dying son to sell them for herself; or if she would trust the\nbusiness to him. The last possibility sent a thrill of pride through\nhim. If she would! If she only would, he would drive the hardest\nbargains for her, he would bring home more of the beloved cash than she\nexpected, he would prove himself altogether worthy of trust. He knew the\nway, she had taken him with her once, at a Christmas time, when she\nneeded his help in the extra handling. It had been a revelation to\nhim--that wonderful Christmas market; with all its southern richness and\nplenitude, its beautifully decorated stalls, its forests of trees and\nmountains of red-berried holly, and over and above all the gay good\nnature of every human creature thronging the merry place.\n\nThat had been Jim's one glimpse, one bit of knowledge what Christmas\nmeant, and though he knew that this was a far different season, the\nglamour of his first \"marketing\" still hung over the place where he had\nbeen so briefly happy. Why, even Miranda Stott, moved by the universal\ngood will of that day, had spent a whole cent, a fresh, new, good cent,\nupon a tin whistle, and given it to her helper. She had done more; she\nhad allowed him to blow upon it, on their long ride home, to the\nastonishment of the mules and his own intense, if silly, delight.\nSuddenly, into these happy memories and hopes, broke Dorothy's voice:\n\n\"A 'penny for your thoughts,' Sobersides! And see? since you made me\npick berries I made up my mind to beat you. I have. I've filled five\ncups while you've been filling three. Your hands are so big, I s'pose,\nyou can't help being slow!\"\n\nUnmoved by her gibes, which he quite failed to understand, he rose and\ntook her cups from her. He had reached the end of his row and must pass\nto another, else he might not have wasted so much time! But he was glad\nof her swiftness and felt that she would almost make up for Mrs. Stott's\nabsence from the field; and encouragingly remarked:\n\n\"Take the next row, beyond mine, when you get that one done.\"\n\n\"Huh! A case of 'virtue' and its 'own reward'! The more I work the\nlonger I may work, eh? Generous soul! But, I don't work for nothing, as\nyou do. Behold, I take my pay as I go!\" and so saying, Dorothy plumped a\nmagnificent berry into her mouth--as far as it would go! For the fruit\nwas so large it easily made more than the proverbial \"two bites.\"\n\nJim laughed. He couldn't help it. She looked so pretty and so innocent,\nthough he--well, he wouldn't eat a single berry that was not given to\nhim. He didn't even warn her not to eat more, yet, somehow, she no\nlonger cared to do so.\n\nDorothy never forgot that busy day. Miranda did not appear, except at\nrare intervals, to give some advice but not once to reprove. Her coarse,\nmasculine face was so sad, so empty of that greed which had been its\nchief blemish, that tender-hearted Dorothy was moved to lay her hand on\nthe mother's arm and say:\n\n\"I'm so sorry for you. Sorry I gave anybody you love the measles.\"\n\nThe market-woman looked at the child half-seeing, half-comforted by this\nsympathy, till the last words, apparently just penetrating to her\nconsciousness, she rudely shook off the little hand with a look of\nbitter hatred. Then she went back into the house, and for the rest of\nthat day the boy and girl were left to themselves.\n\nAt noon, which he told by the sun, Jim made a little fire in one corner\nof the field and roasted some potatoes under it. Then he fixed a\ncrotched stick above the blaze, hung on a tin pail and boiled some eggs;\nand these with some bread made their dinner. Their supper was the same,\nand both had appetites to give the food a relish.\n\nAt dusk Miranda came out, ordered Dorothy into the harness room and to\nbed, and this time she closed the door upon her, turning the wooden\nbutton which fastened it upon the outside. Indignation made no\ndifference--Dorothy's wishes were ignored as if they had not been\nexpressed, and the farm-woman's manner was far harsher than it had been\nat any time. So harsh, indeed, that the girl was terribly frightened and\nwondered if she were going to be punished in some dreadful way for her\nunconscious infection of \"Mr. Smith.\"\n\nThe hope that Jim might be sent to market in place of his mistress and\nthat he would take her with him died in her heart. She did not realize,\ntill she heard her prison door slam shut, how deeply she had cherished\nthis hope; even this belief that she was passing her last day on the\ntruck-farm; and when the climax of her disappointment was reached by\nhearing Tiger ordered to lie down outside her door and \"Watch!\" she\nthrew herself on the hay-bed and sobbed herself to sleep.\n\n\"H-hsst!\"\n\nDorothy sat up, freshly alarmed by this warning sound.\n\n\"Why! It's daylight! I must have slept all night! That's Jim--and\nnothing's happened! I'm alive, I'm well, I feel fine!\"\n\nDelighted surprise at this state of things promptly succeeded her first\nalarm, and when to the \"H-hsst!\" there followed the fumbling of somebody\nwith the door's button, she sprang to her feet and asked:\n\n\"That you, Jim? Time to get up, already?\"\n\nShe had not undressed, and hurried to push the door open, but could not\nimagine what was the matter with the \"long boy.\" He had a newspaper in\nhis hand which he wildly waved above his head, then held at arm's length\nthe better to study, while between times, he executed a crazy dance, his\nbare feet making no sound upon the hay-littered floor.\n\nA second later, Dorothy had rushed at him, seized the paper from his\nhand, recognized that it was father John's favorite daily, and found her\nown gaze startled by the sentence that had caught his:\n\nFIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE FLIGHT IN THE NIGHT\n\n\n\"What does it mean? What does it mean!\" cried the astonished girl,\nscarcely believing the words that were printed so plainly yet seemed so\nimpossible. \"It's my own name. I'm Dorothy Chester, called Dorothy C.\nIt's about me--I see it's about me--there couldn't be another right here\nin Baltimore--and money--all that money--who? Where? What? O long boy,\ntalk, talk, tell!\"\n\nHe was really as excited as she. For once he forgot caution and was\nindifferent to the opinion of his mistress, whether that were good or\nill. He could not read very well. He had had to study that advertisement\nslowly before he could make out even its sentences, and to do a deal of\nthinking before he could actually comprehend their meaning. But he knew\nthat it concerned his new friend even more than himself, and laying his\nhand upon her shoulder to steady her while he answered, began:\n\n\"I did go to market. She went, too. She had to get some things for him,\nan' soon's the stores was open. I sold the stuff. Some of the things she\nbought was wrapped up and a pair o' shoes was in this here. I ain't got\nbooks. I want 'em. I keep every scrap o' paper ever gets this way, an' I\nlearn out o' them. She fired _this_ away, for cattle-beddin'--'cause she\ncan't read herself--an' 'twould save a speck of straw. I called it\nwicked waste, myself, so I hid it. Then whilst I was milkin' I begun to\nstudy it out. Thinks I, mebbe I can learn a hull new word afore I get\nthrough; an' I hit fust off on that there 'Dorothy,' 'cause 'twas yourn\nan' had so many 'O's' it looked easy. I read that, then I read the\nnext--some more--I forgot to milk--I thought you'd never wake\nup--an'--Pshaw! Pshaw--_pshaw_--PSHAW!!\"\n\nOnly by that word could the excited lad begin to express his fierce\nemotions; while for a brief time Dorothy was silent, trying to\nunderstand. Finally, and almost calmly, she said:\n\n\"I don't know a thing about this printed stuff except that it must mean\nme. I can't guess who would pay money for me, for just a little girl;\nthough maybe father John would if he had it. But he hadn't. He was poor,\nhe said, real poor; even if we did live so nice and cozy. He hadn't\nanything but what he earned and out of that he had to buy the food\nand clothes and pay on the house. I don't believe he ever had\nfive hundred dollars in all his life, at one time. Think of it!\nFive--whole--hundred--dollars! Fifty--thousand--cents! My!\"\n\nJim regarded her with awe. Such erudition as this almost took away his\nbreath. That anybody, a little girl so much younger than himself, could\n\"reckon\" figures at such lightning speed was away beyond his dreams.\nMore than that it convinced him that now she must be saved, restored to\npeople who valued her at such enormous price. His simple rule of \"right\nor wrong\" resolved itself into two questions: Should he be loyal to his\nemployer and help to keep this valuable Dorothy on the truck-farm, and\nshow its owner how to get all that money? Because it wasn't she\nherself, who had brought the girl here, and if she took Dorothy back the\nreward would be hers. He reasoned that out to the end.\n\nOn the other hand: If Dorothy belonged to somebody who wanted her so\nmuch, shouldn't he help to restore her to that person and save them--or\nhim--the money?\n\nIt was a knotty problem; one almost too profound for the mind of this\nhonest farm-boy. He would do right, he must; but--which was \"the\nrightest right of them two\"?\n\nDorothy settled it. Dorothy who was the most concerned in the affair and\nhad so much more wisdom than he. She had ceased to wonder at the strange\nadvertisement and had now decided how to turn it to the best account.\nShe was almost positively glad for all her misadventures and suffering\nsince it could result in infinite good to another; and that other none\nbut the \"long boy\" she had laughed at in the beginning. With a little\njoyful clap of her hands, she exclaimed:\n\n\"I know how! I know how! You have _been_--you can find the way--you\nmust help me back to Baltimore, to my folks, to these Kidder-Kiddery men\nthat offer all that money. I never heard of them. I can't imagine why\nthey want to pay so many good dollars for a girl, just a girl they can't\neven know. I wouldn't trust them. I wouldn't go into anybody's 'office'\nagain for all the world. But you take me, show me the way to the city\nand I'll show you the way to Baltimore Street. I know it. I know it\nquite well. I've been there on a street car. Then I'll stand outside\nwhile you go in and ask for the money. If they won't give it to you,\nbring them to the street and show them--ME! I ought to call myself in\ncapital letters, same as I'm printed there, if I'm so expensive as that!\nThink of it, Jim Barlow! If you get that five hundred dollars you can\nlive somewhere else and study all the time and go to college and be\nPresident, just exactly as I told you! Oh! Oh! O--Oh! Let's start now,\nthis minute! I can't wait, I cannot!\"\n\nJim listened intently. With a slowly growing wonder and delight on his\nhomely features, with a widening of his blue eyes, and--at last with a\nburst of tears. He was ashamed of them, instantly, but he couldn't have\nhelped shedding them at that supreme moment any more than he could have\nhelped breathing. It was as if the girl's words had opened wide the\ngates of Paradise--the Paradise of Knowledge--and let him look within.\n\nThen the cottage door opened and Miranda Stott looked forth. The sight\nof her restored him to the present and the practical side of life. The\nfive hundred dollars wouldn't be his, of course. That notion of\nDorothy's was as wild as--as the flight of that chicken-hawk sailing\nover the barnyard. Nor could he start at once, as she demanded. He had\nlived here for years and he still owed his employer allegiance--to a\ncertain extent. Less than ever would he leave her alone with all this\nfarm work on hand as well as a sick son. He must find somebody to take\nhis place. Then he would help Dorothy back to town, but they'd have to\nbe careful.\n\nDorothy, also, had seen Mrs. Stott at the door, but now had a strange\nindifference to her. How could anybody hurt a girl who was worth five\nhundred dollars to somebody? She stopped Jim as he was moving away and\ndemanded:\n\n\"Are you ready? Can we start now--when she's shut the door?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nHer face saddened and he hastened to add:\n\n\"S-ssh! Don't say nothin'. We'll go. I've got to think it over--how. An'\nto hunt somebody to work. But--we'll go--_we'll go_!\"\n\nHe hastily turned away from the sight of her reproachful eyes nor did he\nblame her for the angry: \"You mean boy!\" which she hurled after him as\nhe went into the house. But he made a chance soon to talk with her,\nunheard by Miranda, and to lay his plans before her.\n\n\"I know a feller'll come, I guess. He was in the county-farm an' jobs\nround, somewheres. He don't live nowheres. I seen him loafin' round them\nwoods, yonder, yesterday, an' I'll try find him. If I do I'll coax him\nto stay an' help whilst I'm gone. Noonin' I'll leave you get the grub,\nwhilst I seek him. Go 'long, just's if nothin' was different an' I'll\nhelp you.\"\n\nDorothy had made sundry \"starts\" already, but had feared to go all\nalone. If Jim would only go with her and knew the way it would be all\nright, but the day seemed interminable; and when her friend disappeared\nat noon she was so frightened that she retreated to her barn bedroom and\nshut the door upon herself. She could not lock it, for its one fastening\nwas on the outside; but she called Tiger to come inside with her and\nfelt a sort of protection in his company, sharing her chunk of brown\nbread with him, even giving him by far the larger portion.\n\nThen Jim came back and, missing her, guessed where to find her.\n\n\"Open the door a minute. Lemme in.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm so glad you've come! It seems--awful. That house so tight shut;\nthat man in it; that dreadful woman that looked at me so--so angry! I\nwant to get away, I must--_I must_!\"\n\nTired with his breathless run to the woods and back, the youth dropped\ndown on the floor to recover himself; then informed her:\n\n\"I found him. He was fishin' in the run. He'll fish all day if he's let.\nHe'll come. He ain't got all his buttons----\"\n\n\"Wh-a-t?\"\n\n\"His buttons. His wits. He ain't so smart as some of us, but he can hoe\nan' 'tend cattle first-rate. We'll go, to-night, soon's it's dark. I'll\ntie some rags on your feet so's they won't get sore an' give out. I'll\nhave to muzzle Tige, or, if I can, I'll give him some them powders in\nhis milk she'd ha' used to make you dopy, if you'd give trouble. She\nwon't miss us first off, an' when she does--Why, we'll be gone. Be you a\ngood, free traveler?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know. I never traveled,\" answered Dorothy, perplexed. If\nthey were going to walk, or run, as his talk about trying on rags\nsuggested, how could they travel? To her \"travel\" meant a journey by\nboat or rail, and surely neither of these conveniences were visible.\n\n\"Pshaw! Fer a smart girl you're the biggest fool!\" returned the\nfarm-boy testily. He was tired, body and brain; he was trying to make\nsafe plans for her comfort, yet she couldn't understand plain English.\n\"What I mean is--can you walk, hoof it, good? Course, we can't go no\nother way. If you can we'll strike 'cross lots--the nighest. If you\ncan't we'll have to take to the road, on the chance of bein' took up.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'll walk, I'll travel, I'll 'hoof' it, fast as you want me to.\nTill I die and give out; but don't, don't go anywhere near the danger of\nbeing took up!\" cried Dorothy, pleading meekly.\n\nAgain these two young Americans had failed to understand each other's\nspeech. To the city-reared girl, being \"taken up\" meant being arrested\nby the police; to the country-grown boy it was giving a ride to a\npedestrian by some passing vehicle. He looked at her a moment and let\nthe matter drop. Then he rose, advising:\n\n\"You better go to work an' not waste time. To-morrow's Sunday. We\ngen'ally pick all day, so's to be ready for Monday mornin' market. Stuff\nfetches the best prices a-Monday. I'd like to leave her in good shape\nagin I didn't get back. But I'll take you. You can trust me.\"\n\nAnd as she saw him return to that endless weeding in the garden, Dorothy\nknew that she could do so; and that it was his simple devotion to the\n\"duty\" she disliked that made him so reliable.\n\n\"But oh! what a day this is! Will it never, never end? Do you know, Jim\nBarlow, that it seems longer than all the days put together since I saw\nmy mother?\"\n\n\"Yep. I know. I've been that way. Once--once I went to--a--circus! Once\nI got to go!\" answered the lad, carefully storing the baskets of early\npease he had picked in the depths of the schooner. He made the statement\nwith bated breath, remembering the supreme felicity of the event. \"She\nwent. She'd had big prices an' felt good. She told me 'twas a-comin' an'\nI could; and--Pshaw! I never seen a week so long in all my born days,\nnever! An' when it got to the last one of all--time just natchally drug!\nI know. But we'll go. An' say, Dorothy. The faster you pick an' pack an'\npull weeds, the shorter the day'll be. That's the onliest way I ever\nlived through that last one afore that circus,\" comforted Jim, himself\ntoiling almost breathlessly, in order to leave Miranda in \"as good\nshape\" as he could. He knew how she would miss him, and that she had\ndepended upon him as firmly as upon herself.\n\nBut all days come to an end, even ones weighted with expectations such\nas Dorothy's; and at nightfall Jim announced that they might stop work.\nLeaving the girl to wait in the harness-room he went to the house,\nsecured a whole loaf of bread and two of the sleeping powders he had\nseen administered to the crying boy, and a bundle of rags, with some\nstring. In carrying the milk to the dairy he had reserved a basin full;\nand into this his first business it was to drop the powders. Then he\ncalled Tige to drink the milk, and the always hungry animal greedily\nobeyed.\n\n\"That seems dreadful, Jim! Suppose the stuff kills him? He isn't to\nblame and I should hate terribly to really hurt him,\" cried Dorothy,\nfrightened by the deed to which she had eagerly consented but now\nregretted--too late.\n\nJim sniffed. He supposed that all girls must be changeable. This one\nveered from one opinion to another in a most trying way and the only\nthing he could do was to pay no attention to her whimsies. He had\ncarefully explained the action of these powders and their harmlessness\nand wasn't going to do it the second time. Besides, he was delighted to\nfind them promptly affecting the mastiff, who might have hindered their\nflight. So he merely motioned Dorothy to sit down on the door sill, at\nthe rear of the barn and out of sight from the cottage, then bade her:\n\n\"Hold up your foot. I'll fix 'em. Then we'll go. We can eat on the road.\nAin't so dark as I wish it was but she's asleep--right on the kitchen\nfloor--an' it's our chance. She's slept that way ever since he was so\nbad. He don't 'pear to know nothin' now. I'm sorry for her.\"\n\n\"Why, that's real ingenious! That's almost like a regular shoe! And a\ngood deal better than a shoe too small!\" laughed the girl, wild with\npleasure that her helper had, at last, begun to do something toward\ntheir trip. She found, too, that with these rude sandals tied on she\ncould walk much faster than in her tender bare feet, although Jim\ncautioned:\n\n\"Ain't nothin' but rags an' paper. Remember that. Ain't no call to go\nscuffin' 'em out, needless.\"\n\nWhereupon Dorothy ceased to dance and prance, as she had been doing to\nwork off some of her excitement, and became quite as sober as he could\ndesire. Also, though she had been so anxious to start, it came with\nsuddenness when he said:\n\n\"Ready. Come!\"\n\nShe glanced at Tiger, who very closely resembled a dead dog as he lay\nbeside the basin on the floor, then toward the house. Utter silence\neverywhere; save for the fretful fussing of some hens, settling to\nroost, and a low rumble of thunder from the west where it now looked\nquite dark enough to satisfy even Jim Barlow.\n\nThey struck off across lots, past the teeming garden which the active\nyoung farmer really loved and which he felt that he would never see\nagain. He held Dorothy's hand in one of his, while the other carried a\nstick and bundle thrown over his shoulder. The bundle was a bit of old\ncloth, containing his beloved spelling book, the newspaper with the\nalluring advertisement, and their loaf of bread. Nothing else; and thus\nequipped, this uncouth, modern knight errant turned his back on all he\nhad ever known for the sake of a helpless girl, and with as true a\nchivalry as ever filled the breast of ancient man-at-arms.\n\nFor some distance neither spoke. The hearts of both were beating high\nwith excitement and some fear; but after a time, when no call had\nfollowed them and they had reached the little run where Jim had sought\nthe half-wit, the farm-boy said:\n\n\"Best eat our grub, now. Can't travel fast on empty stummicks. Mebbe\nyour feet need fixin' over, too. I brung some more rags in my jumper,\ncase them give out. Here's a good place to set. We can get a drink out\nthe brook.\"\n\n\"I'd rather go on. I'm not a bit hungry!\" pleaded Dorothy, who already\nfelt as if her mother's arms were folding about her and who longed to\nmake this fancy prove the dear reality.\n\n\"I be, then. I didn't eat no noonin', recollec'?\" returned Jim, and\ndropped down on the bank with a sigh.\n\n\"Oh! I'm sorry I forgot. Of course we'll stop--just as long as you\nwant,\" returned the girl, with keen self-reproach, and sat down beside\nhim. As she did so, there came a fresh rumble from the west and the pale\nlight which had guided them so far was suddenly obscured, so that she\ncried out in fear: \"There's going to be a fearful gust! We shall be wet\nthrough!\"\n\n\"Reckon we will; here's a chunk o' bread,\" answered the matter-of-fact\nyouth, reaching through the gloom to place the \"chunk\" on her lap, and,\nto his surprise, to find her wringing her hands as if in fright or pain.\n\"Why, tell me what ails you now.\"\n\n\"No-nothing--only--ouch! Don't--don't worry--it's--Ooo-oh!\"\n\nDespite her fierce will to the contrary Dorothy could not restrain a\nbitter groan. She had not meant to hinder their flight by any breakdown\non her own part. She had intended to \"travel,\" to \"hoof it\" just as\nrapidly and as \"freely\" as her guide could; but something had happened\njust now, though her feet had hurt her almost from the first moment of\ntheir walk; but this was worse, and reaching down she felt what she\ncould not see--one end of a great thorn or splinter projecting from the\nball of her foot.\n\n\"What's the matter, I say?\" demanded Jim, quite fiercely for him. He had\nno fear but that her pluck would be equal to any strain put upon it, but\nof her physical endurance he wasn't so sure.\n\n\"It's a thorn--or a splinter--and oh! it hurts! put your hand\nhere--feel!\" Yet as she guided his fingers to that queer thing sticking\nfrom her wonderful \"sandals\" she winced and almost screamed. \"I guess\nyou mustn't touch it. I can't bear it. I've run something in and I\ndaren't pull it out--I can't--it's awful!\"\n\nIndeed the agony was making her feel faint and queer and the boy felt,\nrather than saw, that she swayed where she sat as if she were about to\nsink down on the ground.\n\nHere was plainly another case of \"duty\" and an unpleasant one, from\nwhich the lad shrank. He would much rather have borne any amount of pain\nhimself than have inflicted more on this forlorn little girl who\ndepended upon him; but all he said was: \"Pshaw!\" as setting his teeth,\nhe suddenly gripped her foot and--in an instant the great bramble was\nout!\n\nIt was heroic treatment and Dorothy screamed; then promptly fainted\naway. When she came to herself she was dripping with water from the\nbrook, with which Jim had drenched her--not knowing what better to do;\nand from a sudden downpour of rain which came almost unhindered through\nthe branches overhead.\n\n\"Pshaw! I'd oughter 'a' took to the road. I hadn't no business to try\nthis way, though 'tis nigher!\"\n\nThat was the first thing Dorothy realized; the next that her foot was\naching horribly, but not in that sickening way it had before; and lastly\nthat, as the only means of keeping it dry, Jim had thrust their loaf\nback into the bundle and was sitting upon that! A lightning flash\nrevealed this to her, but did not prepare her for her companion's next\nwords:\n\n\"We got to go back!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA GOOD SAMARITAN\n\n\n\"Never! Never! I'd rather die right here in the woods!\" cried Dorothy,\naghast. \"Dead or alive that man shall never get me in his power again.\nBut I'm not afraid. God is good to orphan children--He will take care of\nme--He will, He will!\"\n\nIn some way she managed to get upon her knees and the next flash of\nlightning showed her thus, with her face uplifted and her hands clasped,\nwhile an agony of supplication was in her wide brown eyes.\n\nReligion was an unknown thing to poor Jim Barlow, whose simple integrity\nwas of nature, not culture. His Sundays had been merely days on which to\ntoil a little harder against the morrow's market, nor had he ever been\ninside a church. But something in the sight of this child kneeling\nthere in the night and the storm touched an unknown chord of his soul,\nand before he knew it he was kneeling beside her. Not to pray, as she\ndid, but to hold her firmly, to comfort her by his human touch for this\nfresh terror he did not understand.\n\nAfter a moment she turned and sat down again and said just as firmly as\nbefore, but quite calmly now:\n\n\"If you want to go back you may. I shall not. God will take care of me,\neven if you leave me all alone. I've asked Him.\"\n\n\"Leave you alone? I hadn't thunk of it. What you mean?\"\n\n\"You said we must go back. I shall not.\"\n\n\"_Pshaw!_\" It was several seconds before honest Jim could say anything\nmore, but those five letters held a world of meaning. Finally, he was\nable to add to them and to help her seat herself again on the ground,\nand he is scarcely to be blamed if he did this with some force. From his\npoint of view Dorothy was stupid. She should have known that he never\ngave up doing that to which he had set his hand. He had promised to get\nher back to Baltimore, some way, and he would keep his promise. With\nanother, rather milder \"Pshaw!\" he explained:\n\n\"Go back an' try the road, silly! These cross-cuts are dreadful\nonsartain. Full o' blackberry bushes an' thorny stuff would hurt a\ntougher foot 'an yourn. More'n that: shoes made out o' rags an' paper\nain't much good in a rain storm. We'll get back to the road. Even that's\na long way off, but it's over open medders an' it's so dark nobody won't\nsee us er stop us. It ain't rainin' nigh so hard now. You eat a bite,\nthen we'll try agin.\"\n\n\"Oh! forgive me, Jim Barlow, for thinking you would be so mean. I'll\ntrust you now, no matter what happens, but I don't want to eat. I\ncan't--yet.\"\n\n\"Does your foot hurt bad?\"\n\n\"Not--not--so very!\"\n\n\"Well, hold on. I'll break that there sapling off an' make you a stick\nto help walk on. 'Tother hand you can lean on my shoulder. Now, soon's\nyou say the word we'll go. Not the way we come, but another, slatin'er.\nTry?\"\n\nThey stood up: Dorothy with more pain than she would acknowledge, but\nputting a brave face on the matter, and Jim more anxious than he had\never been about anybody in his life. He didn't speculate as to why all\nthese strange things had come into his life, as Dorothy had done, but he\naccepted them as simple facts of which he must make the best. The best\nhe could make of this present situation was to get this lamed girl to a\npublic highway as soon as he could. Even that might be deserted now, on\na rainy Saturday night, but he hoped for some help there.\n\n\"Now--come.\"\n\nDorothy made a valiant effort and managed to get ahead a few inches.\nThen, half-laughing, half-crying, she explained:\n\n\"I can't manage it. I can't walk on one foot and drag the other.\nI--Can't you hide me here, somewhere, and go on by yourself, then send\nsomebody back after me? Would it be safe, do you think?\"\n\n\"No, 'twouldn't, an' I shan't. If you can't walk--then hop!\"\n\nSo, resting one hand on his shoulder and the other upon the stick he had\nbroken, the girl--hopped! It was very awkward, very painful, and very\nslow; but it was only the slowness that mattered. This was exasperating\nto one whose blood was in a ferment of anxiety to be at her journey's\nend. Even Jim lost patience after they had gone some distance and\nstopped short, saying, with a sigh:\n\n\"This won't do. I'll have to haul you. You're limpin' worse all the\ntime, an' it'd take a month o' Sundays to travel a mile this gait. Now,\nwhilst I stoop down, you reach up an' put your arms 'round my neck. Make\nyourself light's you can, an' we'll try it that way a spell. When I gin\nout we'll wait an' rest. Now ketch hold!\"\n\nHe took her staff in one hand, stooped his back like a bow, and Dorothy\nclasped her arms about his shoulders. Then he straightened himself and\nher feet swung clear of the ground. Fortunately, she was slight and he\nstrong, and for another little while they proceeded quite rapidly. Also,\nhe knew perfectly well the direction he ought to take, even in this\ndarkness of night; and he was accustomed to walking in the fields. Then,\nsuddenly, he had to stop.\n\n\"Guess we better rest a spell. 'Twon't do to get _all_ tuckered out\nfirst off;\" and with that he dumped her on the wet grass, very much as\nhe might a sack of meal. Then he sat down himself, while she merrily\ncried:\n\n\"That's the first time I've been carried pick-a-back since I was ever so\nlittle! How splendid and strong you are! Do you suppose we have come\nhalf-way yet?\"\n\n\"Half-way? Pshaw! We ain't got no furder 'an the first half-mile, if so\nfur. My sake, girls are orful silly, ain't they?\"\n\nDorothy's temper flamed. She felt she had been very brave, for her foot\nhad swollen rapidly and pained her greatly, yet she had suppressed every\ngroan and had made \"herself as light as she could,\" according to Jim's\ncommand. Now she would have none of his help. No matter what she\nsuffered she would go on by herself. Then some evil thing tempted her to\nask:\n\n\"Do you know where you're going, Jim Barlow, anyway?\"\n\nAnd he retorted with equal spirit:\n\n\"D' you s'pose I'd haul such a heavy creatur' 's you so fur on a wrong\nroad?\"\n\nAfter which little interchange of amenities, the pair crawled forward\nagain and came at last to a hedge of honeysuckle bordering a wide lane.\nThe fragrance brought back to Dorothy's memory her own one, carefully\ntended vine in the little garden on Brown Street, and sent a desolate\nfeeling through her heart. Sent repentant tears, also, to her eyes and\nmade her reach her hand out toward her companion, with a fresh apology:\n\n\"Jim, I've got to say 'forgive me,' again and--I do say it--yet I hate\nit. You've been so good and--Smell the honeysuckle! My darling father\nJohn told me there were quantities of it growing wild all through\nMaryland, but I never half-believed it before. It makes me cry!\"\n\n\"Set down an' cry, then, if you want to. I just as lief's you would. I'm\ntired.\"\n\nThis concession had the remarkable effect of banishing tears from\nDorothy's eyes. She had tottered along on one foot and the tips of the\ntoes of the other, till the injured one had become seriously strained\nand pained her so that rest she must, whether he were willing or not. It\nwas comparatively dry on the further side the hedge, and the vines\nthemselves, so closely interwoven, made a comfortable support for their\ntired backs. As she leaned against it, the girl's sense of humor made\nher exclaim:\n\n\"That's the funniest thing! I felt I must cry my eyes out, yet when you\nsaid 'go ahead and do it,' every tear dried up! But, I'm sleepy. Do you\nsuppose we dare go to sleep for a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! I'm sleepy, too. An' I'm goin'--s'posin' er no s'posin'.\"\n\nAfter that, there was a long silence under the honeysuckle hedge. A\nsecond shower, longer and more violent than the first, arose, and dashed\nits cool drops on the faces of these young sleepers, but they knew\nnothing of that. The storm cleared and the late moon came out and shone\nupon them, yet still they did not stir. It was not until the sun itself\nsent its hot, summer rays across their closed lids that Jim awoke and\nsaw a man standing beside them in the lane and staring at Dorothy with\nthe keenest attention.\n\nInstantly the lad's fear was alert. He had not spoken of it to Dorothy,\nbut he knew that many others besides himself must have seen that\nwonderful advertisement in the daily paper; and though he was not wise\nenough to also know that every wandering child would suggest to somebody\nthe chance of earning that five hundred, he had made up his mind that\nnobody should earn it. Dorothy should be restored without price, and he\nhad promised her his should be the task. There was that about this\nstaring stranger which made him throw a protecting arm over the still\nsleeping Dorothy and say:\n\n\"Well! Think you'll know us when you see us agin?\"\n\n\"Come, come, boy! keep a civil tongue in your head. Who is that little\ngirl?\"\n\n\"None o' your business.\"\n\n\"Hold on. I'll make it my business, and lively, too, if you don't look\nout. Where'd you two come from?\"\n\n\"Where we was last at.\"\n\n\"You scallawag! Your very impudence proves you're up to some mischief,\nbut I'll ask you once more, and don't you dare give me a lying answer:\nWhere did you two come from?\"\n\n\"Norphan asylum,\" said Jim, patting Dorothy's hand to quiet her alarm;\nfor she had, also, waked and was frightened by the stranger, as well as\nby that strange numbness all through her body and the terrible pain in\nher foot.\n\n\"Girl, what's your name?\"\n\nDorothy did not answer. She did not appear even to hear, but with a\nstupid expression turned her head about on the honeysuckle branches and\nagain closed her eyes. Part of this dullness was real, part was feigned.\nShe felt very ill and, anyway, there was Jim. Let him do what talking\nwas necessary.\n\nAgain the stranger demanded:\n\n\"Who is that girl? Where did you get her? Is she deaf and dumb--or just\na plain everyday fool?\"\n\n\"Dunno, stranger. Give it up,\" said Jim, at the same time managing to\nnudge Dorothy unperceived, by way of hint that that suggested\ndeaf-and-dumbness might serve them well.\n\nThe man who was quizzing them so sharply had been riding a spirited\nhorse, which now began to prance about the lane in a dangerous way, and\nfor the moment distracted his attention from the children. Indeed, in\norder to quiet the animal he had to mount and race it up and down for a\ntime, though he by no means intended to leave that place until he had\nsatisfied himself whether this were or were not the missing little girl,\nof whose disappearance all the papers were now so full. If it were and\nfive hundred dollars depended on her rescue from that country\nbumpkin--he was the man for the rescue! Being none other than a suburban\n\"constable\" with a small salary, as well as a local horse jockey,\nexercising a rich gentleman's new hunter--also for hire.\n\nAs he galloped past them, to and fro, Dorothy grew more and more\nfrightened and ill. Her long sleep in her water-soaked clothing, added\nto the pain in her foot and her lack of food, affected her seriously;\nand a bed with warm blankets and hot drinks was what she needed just\nthen. Finally, when to the thud of the racer's feet there also sounded\nthe rumble of approaching wheels, she felt that her doom was sealed and\nlet her tears stream freely over her wan, dirt-streaked cheeks.\n\nJim, also, felt a shiver of fear steal through his long limbs, and\ninstinctively drew his young charge closer to him, resolved to protect\nher to the last. But, as the wheels drew nearer, there was mingled with\ntheir rumble the notes of a good old hymn, and presently both wheels and\nmusic came to an abrupt halt before the hedge and the forlorn pair\nhalf-hidden in it.\n\n\"Why, bless my heart! Younkers, where'd you hail from? and why should a\npretty little girl be crying on the first Sunday morning in June? When\neverything else in God's dear world is fairly laughing with joy! Why,\nhoney, little one--what--what--what!\"\n\nIt was a tiny, very rickety gig from which the singer had leaped with\nthe agility of youth, though his head was almost white, and green\ngoggles covered his faded old eyes; and he had not finished speaking\nbefore he had climbed upon the bank to the hedge and had put his\nfatherly arms around the sobbing Dorothy.\n\nShe opened her own eyes long enough to see that benignant, grizzled\ncountenance close to her, and--in an instant her arms had clasped about\nthe stranger's neck! With the unerring instinct of childhood she knew a\nfriend at first glance, and she clung to this man as if she would never\nlet him go, while the astonished Jim looked on, fairly gasping for the\nbreath that he at last emitted in the one word: \"P-S-H-A-W!!\" Here was\nanother phase of that changeable creature--girl! To cry her eyes out at\nsight of one stranger and to fling herself headlong into the arms of\nanother--not half so good looking!\n\nLeaning back among the vines and coolly folding his arms, the farm-boy\nresigned himself to whatever might come next. He had most carefully\nplanned all their trip \"home\" and not a single detail of it had followed\nhis plan. \"Give it up!\" he remarked for the second time, and was\nimmediately answered by the old man:\n\n\"No, you don't. Nobody decent ever does give up in this sunshiny world\nof God's. That isn't what He put us in it for, but to keep right on\njogging along, shedding happiness, loving Him, being content. How did\nthis poor little darling ever hurt her tiny foot like that?\"\n\nAlready the old fellow had Dorothy on his lap and was examining with\ncareful tenderness the angry-looking wound she had received, while her\ncurly head rested as contentedly against his breast as if it had been\nthat of father John himself.\n\nShe opened her lips to tell, but she was too tired. Indeed, if she had\nfelt equal to the labor of it she would have poured forth her whole\nstory then and there. But it is doubtful if he would have tarried to\nhear it, for he rose at once, carrying the girl in his arms so gently,\nso lovingly, that a great wave of happiness swept over her, and she\nflashed her own old beautiful smile into his goggles:\n\n\"Oh! you good man. God sent you, didn't He?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure! To you, one of His lambs! Come, son. We'll be going! This\npoor little foot must be attended to right away, and this is my 'busy\nday.' On my way to preach at an early service, for the poor colored folk\nwho can't come later. Then to another one for scattered white folks--the\nrest of the day at the hospitals--Why, bless my heart! If my Sundays\nwere fifty times as long I could fill every minute of them with the\nMaster's work!\"\n\nMore nimbly than Jim could have done, the happy old man scrambled back\ninto the gig, never once releasing his hold of Dorothy, gathered up his\nreins, bade the lad \"Hang on behind, some way!\" chirruped to his sleepy\nnag, and drove on singing out of the lane.\n\n    \"Bringing in the sheaves! Bringing in the sheaves!\n     We will come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!\"\n\nOnce, in a pause of his song, Dorothy reached up and stroked his cheek,\nsaying:\n\n\"You're taking me home, aren't you!\"\n\n\"Sure, sure! To my home, first, to your home next--if I can;--to your\nheavenly home, when the Master wills.\"\n\nHis home came soon; a tiny, one-storied building with but two rooms, a\nkitchen and bedroom; smaller, even, than the cottage of Miranda Stott,\nbut far neater and cozier. At its door the old minister sprang from the\ngig and directed Jim to leave it where it stood.\n\n\"Old Nan won't move unless she's bid. I'll fix up this little one's\nwound while you get breakfast. Happens I haven't had my own, yet, and I\nknow you haven't had yours. The coffee's in that canister on the shelf.\nThe fire's ready to the match--and the match right here! There's boiled\nham in that cupboard, potatoes to fry, in the ice-box in the shed, bread\nand butter in the cellar, as well as a pail of milk. Show yourself a man\nby setting the table, my boy. How glad I am to have company! I try to\nhave somebody most the time; but I don't often get them so easily as\nI've gotten you two. Young folks, besides; you ought to eat lots! which\nwill give me extra appetite--not that I need it, oh no! A fine\ndigestion is another of my Father's good gifts to me; and do you know,\nladdie, that I rarely have to buy the food to feed my guests? Always\ncomes in of its own accord, seem's if. Of the Lord's accord, more truly.\nHe's not the One to bid you feed the hungry and give drink to the\nthirsty without providing the means. 'Old St. John's' is known as a free\n'hotel' in all this countryside, and my children--In His Name I bid you\nwelcome to it this glorious Sunday morning!\"\n\nDorothy was on the bed in the inner room, and all the time he was\ntalking her jolly host was also attending to her as well as to Jim. She\nwas better already, simply from the cheer of his speech, and that sense\nof perfect security that had come to her so promptly. Such a well-stored\nlittle house as that was! From somewhere, out came a bundle of bandages\nalready prepared, a box of soothing ointment, and a basin of soft warm\nwater to bathe the jagged wound.\n\n\"Learned to be a sort of doctor, too, you see. Never know when a body\nmay come limping up, needing care--just as you have. Tear my bandages\nevenings when it rains. Never have to buy the muslin or linen--neighbors\nall save it for me. Boy--what's your name?--just turn those potatoes\nagain. The secret of nice fried potatoes is to keep them stirred till\nevery bit is yellow-browned, even and tasty. It's a sin, the way some\npeople cook; spoiling the good gifts of the Lord by their own\ncarelessness. Put into everything you do--milking, plowing, cooking,\npreaching, praying, the very best that's in you! That's the way to get\nat the core of life, at its deepest-down happiness and content. That's\ngood! I reckon you're the right sort, only want a little training. The\nway you slice that ham shows you're thorough. Now, watch me settle this\ncoffee and then--for all Thy Mercies, Lord, we humbly thank Thee.\"\n\nSuch a breakfast as that had never been spread before Jim Barlow.\nDorothy had enjoyed many fine ones in her own happy home, but even she\nfound this something out of common; and from the chair of state in which\nshe had been placed at the head of the little table, beamed satisfaction\non the others while she poured their coffee, as deftly as if she were,\nindeed, the \"little woman\" the old man called her.\n\nWhen the meal was over, said he:\n\n\"Lad, I'm a busy man, you seem to be an idle fellow. I'll leave you to\nwash the dishes and put away the food. Carefully, as you found it,\nagainst the need of the next comer. My name is Daniel St. John. My pride\nit is to bear the name of that disciple Jesus loved. Good-bye. Tarry\nhere as long or as short a time as you will. I never lock the door.\nGood-bye. If we do not meet again on earth, I shall look for you in\nHeaven.\"\n\nHe was already passing out into the sunshine but Dorothy cried after\nhim:\n\n\"One moment, please. You have told us your name, but we haven't told you\nours. Yes, Jim, I shall tell! It's right and this dear man will help us,\nnot hinder. So you needn't hold up your finger that way. Mr. St. John, I\nthank you, we both thank you, more than we can say. That boy's name is\nJames Barlow. He's an orphan. I'm an orphan, too. My name is----\"\n\n\"Thank you for confidence. If my day didn't belong to the Master, not to\nmyself, I'd drive you home in the gig. If you stay here till to-morrow I\nwill do so, anyway. Now, I am late about His business, and must be off\nat once!\"\n\nWith that he jumped into his gig, shook the reins over old Nan's back,\nwho went ambling down the road to the music of \"Throw out the life\nline!\" sung to the surrounding hills and dales as only old Daniel St.\nJohn could sing it.\n\nFor some hours the two wanderers rested in that sunny little home, both\nmost reluctant to leave it, and Dorothy's own wish now being to remain\nuntil the Monday when, as he said, their new acquaintance would be at\nliberty to take them to the city. Jim was not so anxious to remain. It\nwas not until his companion's entreaties grew more persistent, that he\ntold her the truth:\n\n\"Dorothy, we _can't_ stay. We mustn't. I dassent. You was scared o' that\nfeller on horseback. Well, he's been ridin' by here two, three times,\nan' he's fetched another feller along. Them men mean bad to us. I've\nstudied out 't they ain't sure the old man ain't to home. If they was\nthey wouldn't wait to ketch us long. The first man, he seen us come with\nSt. John. He must. He couldn't have rid so fur he didn't. Well, I feel's\nif _he_ ketched us, 'twould be out the fryin'-pan into the fire. We\ncouldn't get shet o' him--till he got that five hundred dollars. We've\ngot to go on, someway, somewheres. An'--go _now_, whilst they've rid\nback agin, out o' sight.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nA SUNDAY DRIVE\n\n\nMrs. Cecil was extremely restless. She had been so ever since her visit\nto Kidder & Kidder. She would roam from room to room of her great house,\nstaying long in none, finding fault with everybody and everything, in a\nmanner most unusual. For though she was sharp of speech, at times, the\ntimes were fortunately at intervals, not incessant; but now she had\naltered and her dependents felt it to be for the worse.\n\n\"I declar' my soul, Ephraim, looks lak ouah Miss Betty done got somepin'\non her min', de way she ca'y on erbout nottin er tall. Jus' cayse cook,\nshe done put sallyratus in dem biscuits, stidder raisin' 'em yeas' cake\nway, she done 'most flung 'em offen de table. All de time fussin' wid\nsome us boys an' girls, erbout some fault er nother; an' I lay out it's\nher own min' is all corrodin' wid wickedness. What's yo' 'pinion now,\nEphraim, boy?\"\n\nThe old colored man pushed away his plate and scratched his white wool.\nHe was loyalty itself to his Miss Betty, but in his heart he agreed with\nDinah that the house of Calvert had fallen upon uncomfortable times.\nFortunately, he was saved the trouble of a reply, by the sharp ringing\nof the stable bell.\n\n\"What now!\" cried Dinah, hurrying away.\n\nDinner had been served as usual. As usual Mrs. Cecil had attended\nservice at old St. Paul's, but had felt herself defrauded because the\nrector had invited a stranger to occupy the pulpit: \"when he knows as\nwell as I do that this is my last Sunday in Baltimore, before the\nautumn, and should have paid me the respect of preaching himself,\" she\nhad confided to her next-pew neighbor. Whereupon that other old member\nhad felt herself also aggrieved, and had left the edifice for her\ncarriage in a most unchristian state of mind. As usual, the one\nchurch-going and the stately dinner over, the household had settled into\na Sunday somnolence. Ephraim had a comfortable lounge in the\ncarriage-house loft and was ready for his afternoon nap. Cook was\nalready asleep, in her kitchen rocker; and having finished her own\ngrumble, Dinah was about to follow the universal custom, and seek repose\nin the little waiting-room beyond her mistress's boudoir, while that\nlady enjoyed the same within. For that stable bell to ring at this\nunwonted hour was enough to startle both old servants, and to send Dinah\nspeeding to answer it.\n\n\"Bless yo' heart, Miss Betty, did you-all done ring dat bell? Or did dat\nMethusalem done it, fo' mischievousness?\"\n\n\"I rang it, Dinah. Tell Ephraim to harness his horses. I'm going out for\na drive.\"\n\nDinah delayed to obey. Drive on Sunday? Such a thing was unheard of,\nexcept on the rare occasion of some intimate friend being desperately\nill. Instantly the maid's thought ran over the list of her mistress's\nintimates, but could find none who was ailing, or hardly one who was\nstill in town.\n\n\"Lawd, honey, Miss Betty, who-all's sick?\"\n\n\"Nobody, you foolish girl. Can't I stir off these grounds unless somebody\nis ill? I'm going to drive. I've no need to tell you, you've no right to\nask me--but one must humor imbecility! _I--am--going--to--drive!_ I--I'm\nnot sleeping as well as usual, and I need the air. Now, get my things, and\ndon't stare.\"\n\n\"Yas'm. Co'se. Yas'm. But year me, Miss Betty Somerset, if yo' po' maw\nwas er libin' you-all wouldn't get to go no ridin' on a Sunday ebenin',\njus' if yo' didn' know no diff'rent. Lak dem po' no-'count folks what\ndoan' b'long to good famblies. You-all may go, whuther er no, cayse yo'\ndoes most inginerally take yo' own way. But I owes it to yo' maw to\nrecommind you-all o' yo' plain, Christian duty.\"\n\nWith that Dinah felt she had relieved herself of all obligation either\nto duty or tradition, and proceeded with great dignity to bring out her\nlady's handsome wrap and hat: while down deep in that old gentlewoman's\nbreast fluttered a feeling of actual guilt. It was a lifelong habit she\nwas about to break; a habit that had been the law of her parents in the\ndays of her youth. When one was a privileged person of leisure, who\ncould take her outings on any week-day, she should pay strictest honor\nto the Sabbath.\n\nHowever, Miss Betty had made up her mind to go and Miss Betty went. Not\nonly thus endangering her own soul but those of Dinah and Ephraim as\nwell; and once well out of city limits and the possible observation of\nfriends, the affair began to have for all three the sweet flavor of\nstolen fruit.\n\n\"It's delightful. It's such a perfect day. 'Twould be more sinful to\nwaste it indoors, asleep, than to be out here on the highway, passing\nthrough such loveliness. We'll--_We'll come again_, some other Sunday,\nDinah,\" observed Mrs. Cecil, when they had already traveled some few\nmiles.\n\nBut it was Dinah's hour for sleep, and having been prevented from\nindulging herself at home in a proper place and condition, she saw no\nreason why she shouldn't nod here and now. The carriage was full as\ncomfortable as her own easy-chair, and she had been ordered to ride, not\nto stay awake.\n\nSo, finding her remarks unheeded, Mrs. Cecil set herself to studying the\nlandscape; and she found this so soothing to her tired nerves that when\nthe coachman asked if he should turn about, she indignantly answered:\n\n\"No. Time for that when I give the order. It's my carriage, as I often\nhave to remind you, Ephraim.\"\n\n\"Yas'm. Dat's so, Miss Betty. But dese yere hosses, dey ain' much usen\nto trabelin' so fur, cos' erspecially not inginerally on a _Sunday_.\"\n\n\"Do them good, boy, do them good. They're so fat they can hardly trot a\nrod before they're winded. When we get into the country, and they have\nto climb up and down those hills of the highlands, they'll lose some of\ntheir bulk. They're a sight now. I'm fairly ashamed of them. Touch them\nup, boy, touch them up. See if they can travel at all. They had a good\ndeal of spirit when I bought them, but you'd ruin any team you shook\nthe reins over, Ephraim. Touch them up!\"\n\nEphraim groaned, but obeyed; and, for a brief distance, the bays did\ntrot fairly well, as if there had come to their equine minds a memory of\nthat past when they had been young and frisky. Then they settled down\nagain to their ordinary jog, quite unlike their mistress's mood, which\ngrew more and more excited and gay the longer she trespassed upon her\nold-time habits.\n\nNobody, who loved nature at all, could resist the influence of that\ngolden summer afternoon--\"evening\" as southerners call it. To Mrs. Cecil\nas to little Dorothy, hours before, came the sweet, suggestive odor of\nhoneysuckle; that brought back old memories, touched to tenderness her\nheart, and to an undefinable longing for something and somebody on which\nto expend all that stored-up affection.\n\n\"Tu'n yet, Miss Betty? Dat off hoss done gettin' badly breathed,\"\nsuggested Ephraim, rudely breaking in upon Mrs. Cecil's reflections.\n\n\"Oh, you tiresome boy! One-half mile more, then turn if you will and\nmust. For me--I haven't enjoyed myself nor felt so at peace in--in\nseveral days. Not since that wretched plumber came to Bellevieu and\nstirred me all up with his--gossip. I could drive on forever! but, of\ncourse, I'm human, and I'll remember you, Ephraim, as well as my poor,\nabused horses! One mile--did I say a half? Well, drive on, anyway.\"\n\nIt was at the very turn of the road that she saw them.\n\nA long, lanky lad, far worse winded than her fat bays, skulking along\nbehind the honeysuckle hedge-rows, as if in hiding from somebody. As\nthey approached each other--she in her roomy carriage, he on his bruised\nand aching feet--she saw that he was almost spent; that he carried a\ngirl on his back; and that the desperation of fear was on both their\nyoung faces. Then looking forward along her side of the hedge, down the\nroad that stretched so smooth and even, she saw two men on horseback.\nThey were riding swiftly, and now and then one would rise in his\nstirrups and peer over the hedge, as if to keep in sight the struggling\nchildren, then settle back again into that easy lope that was certain of\nspeedy victory.\n\nMrs. Cecil's nerves tingled with a new--an old--sensation. In the days\nof her girlhood she had followed the hounds over many a well-contested\nfield. Behold here again was a fox-hunt--with two human children for\nfoxes! Whatever they might have done, how deserved re-capture, she\ndidn't pause to inquire. All her old sporting blood rose in her, but--on\nthe side of the foxes!\n\n\"Drive, drive, Ephraim, drive! Kill the horses--save those children!\"\n\nEphraim had once been young, too, and he caught his lady's spirit with a\nreadiness that delighted her. In a moment the carriage was abreast the\nfleeing children on that further side the hedge, and Mrs. Cecil's voice\nwas excitedly calling:\n\n\"Come through! Come through the hedge! We'll befriend you!\"\n\nIt had been a weary, weary race. Although her foot had been so carefully\nbandaged by Daniel St. John, it was not fit to be used and Dorothy's\nsuffering could not be told in words. Jim had done his best. He had\ncomforted, encouraged, carried her; at times, incessantly, but with a\nnow fast-dying hope that they could succeed in evading these pursuers,\nso relentlessly intent upon their capture.\n\n\"It's the money, Dorothy, they want. They mustn't get it. That's your\nfolkses'--do try--you _must_ keep on! I'll--they shan't--Oh, pshaw!\"\n\nWheels again! again added to that thump, thump, thump of steel-shod\nhoofs along the hard road! and the youth felt that the race was\nover--himself beaten.\n\nThen he peered through a break in the honeysuckle and saw a wonderful\nold lady with snow-white hair and a beautiful face, standing up in a\nfiner vehicle than he had known could be constructed, and eagerly\nbeckoning him to: \"Come! Come!\"\n\nHe stood still, panting for breath, and Dorothy lifted her face which\nshe had hidden on his shoulder and--what was that the child was calling?\n\n\"Mrs. Cecil! Mrs. Cecil! Don't you know me? John Chester's little girl?\n'Johnnie'--postman 'Johnnie'--you know him--take me home!\"\n\nThe two horsemen came riding up and reined in shortly. There was\nbewilderment on their faces and disappointment in their hearts; for\nbehold! here were five hundred dollars being swept out of their very\ngrasp by a wealthy old woman who didn't need a cent!\n\nAnd what was that happy old creature answering to the fugitive's appeal\nbut an equally joyful:\n\n\"Dorothy C.! You poor lost darling--Dorothy C.! Thank God you're found!\nThank Him I took this ride this day!\"\n\nAnother moment and not only Dorothy but poor Jim Barlow, mud-stained,\nunkempt, as awkward a lad as ever lived and as humble, was riding toward\nBaltimore city in state, on a velvet-covered cushion beside one of its\nmost aristocratic dames!\n\nThis was a turn in affairs, indeed; and the discomfited horsemen, who\nhad felt a goodly sum already within their pockets, followed the\nequipage into town to learn the outcome of the matter.\n\nDorothy was on Mrs. Cecil's own lap; who minded nothing of the soiled\nlittle garments but held the child close with a pitying maternity,\npathetic in so old and childless a woman.\n\nBut, oddly enough, she permitted no talk or explanation. There would be\ntime enough for that when the safe shelter of Bellevieu was reached and\nthere were no following interlopers to overhear. Even Dinah could only\nsit and stare, wondering if her beloved \"honey\" had suddenly lost her\nwits; but Ephraim comprehended that his mistress now meant it when she\nurged \"Speed! speed!\" and put his fat bays to a run such as they had not\ntaken since their earliest youth.\n\nThrough the eagle-gateway, into the beautiful grounds, around to that\nbroad piazza where Dorothy had made disastrous acquaintance with the two\nGreat Danes, and on quite into the house. But there Jim would have\nretreated, and even Dorothy looked and wondered: saying, as she was\ngently taken in old Dinah's arms and laid upon the mistress's own\nlounge:\n\n\"Thank you, but I won't lie down here, if you please. I love you so much\nfor bringing me back, but home--home's just around the corner, and I\ncan't wait! Jim and I will go now--please--and thank you! thank you!\"\n\nYet now, back in her own home, it was a very calm and courteous old\ngentlewoman--no longer an impulsive one--who answered:\n\n\"For the present, Dorothy C., you will have to be content with\nBellevieu. John Chester and his wife have gone to the country. To a\nfar-away state, and to a little property she owns. Fortunately, I am\ngoing to that same place very soon and will take you to them. I am sorry\nfor your disappointment, but you are safe with me till then.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nMr. Kidder, of Kidder & Kidder, had by request waited upon the lady of\nBellevieu. He was prepared to explain some uncertain matters to her and\nhad delayed his own removal to his country place for that purpose. The\nheat which had made Baltimore so uncomfortable had, for the time being,\npassed; and there was now blowing through the big east-parlor, a breeze,\nredolent of the perfumes of sweet brier and lily-of-the-valley;\nold-fashioned flowers which grew in rank luxuriance outside the wide\nbay-window.\n\nPresently there entered the mistress of the mansion, looking almost\nyouthful in a white gown and with a calm serenity upon her handsome\nfeatures. She walked with that graceful, undulating movement--a sort of\nquiet gliding--which had been the most approved mode of her girlhood,\nand the mere sight of that was restful to the old attorney, who detested\nthe modern, jerky carriage of most maidens.\n\nDorothy attended her hostess and she, too, was in white. Indeed Mrs.\nCecil considered that to be the only suitable home-wear for either maid\nor matron, after the spring days came; and looking critically upon the\npair, the old lawyer fancied he saw a faint resemblance.\n\nEach had large brown and most expressive eyes; each had a hand and foot,\nfit subject for feminine pride, and each bore herself with the same air\nof composed self-sufficiency. Well, it was a fine experiment his client\nwas trying; he could but hope it would not end in disappointment.\n\nShe seemed to know his thoughts without his expressing them; and as she\nsat down, she bade Dorothy lay aside her cane and sit beside her. The\ninjured foot had received the best of medical treatment since the\nchild's arrival at Bellevieu and was now almost well, though some\nsupport had still to be used as a safeguard against strain.\n\n\"This is the child, Mr. Kidder. I think she has intelligence. A fine\nintelligence,\" began the lady, as if Dorothy had not ears to hear. Then\nfeeling the girl's eyes raised inquiringly, added rather hastily: \"It's\non account of 'Johnnie,' you understand, Mr. Kidder. He was one of the\nmost faithful persons I ever knew. That was why he was selected. Why I\nam going to take his little Dorothy C. back to him as fast as\nto-morrow's train will carry us. Have you learned anything?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madam. I came prepared--but----\" He paused again and glanced at\nthe girl, whom her hostess promptly sent away. Then he proceeded:\n\n\"It is the same man I suspected in the beginning. He was a clerk in my\noffice some years ago, at the time, indeed, when I first saw your ward.\nHe listened at a keyhole and heard all arrangements made, but--did not\nsee who was closeted with me and never learned your identity until\nrecently. That is why you have escaped blackmail so long; and he is the\nauthor of the letters you sent me--unopened. He had his eye upon Dorothy\nC. for years, but could use her to no advantage till he traced--I don't\nyet know how, and it doesn't matter--the connection between yourself and\nthe monthly letters. He has been in scrapes innumerable. I discharged\nhim almost immediately after I hired him, and he has owed me a grudge\never since. But--he'll trouble Baltimore people no more. If he recovers\nfrom the dangerous illness he is suffering now he will be offered the\nchoice of exile from the state or a residence in the prison. By the way,\nisn't it a case of poetic justice, that he should be thus innocently\npunished by the child he stole?\"\n\n\"It is, indeed. As to the boy, James. 'Jim,' Dorothy calls him. He seems\nto be without friends, a fine, uncouth, most manly fellow, with an\noverpowering ambition 'to know things'! To see him look at a book, as if\nhe adored it but dared not touch it, is enough--to make me long to throw\nit at him, almost! He is to be tested. I want to go slow with him. So\nmany of my prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9s have disappointed me. But, if he's worth it, I want\nto help him make a man of himself.\"\n\n\"The right word. Just the right, exact word, Madam. 'Help _him_ to make\na man of himself.' Because if he doesn't take a hand in the business\nhimself, all the extraneous help in the world will be useless. Well,\nthen I think we understand each other. I have all your latest advices in\nmy safe, with duplicate copies in that of my son.\n\n\"You leave to-morrow? From Union Station? I wish you, Madam, a safe\njourney, a pleasant summer, and an early return. Good-morning.\"\n\nOn the very evening of Dorothy's arrival at Bellevieu, now some days\npast, she had begged so to \"go home,\" and so failed to comprehend how\nher parents could have left it without her, that Mrs. Cecil sent for the\nplumber and his wife to come to her and to bring Mabel with them.\n\n\"Why, husband! I fair believe the world must be comin' to an end!\nDorothy found, alive, and that rich woman the one to find her! Go!\nCourse we'll go--right off.\"\n\nMr. Bruce was just as eager to pay the visit as his wife, but he prided\nhimself on being a \"free-born American\" citizen and resented being\nordered to the mansion, \"on a Sunday just as if it were a work-day. If\nthe lady has business with us, it's her place to come to Brown Street,\nherself.\"\n\n\"Fiddle-de-diddle-de-dee! Since when have we got so top-lofty?\" demanded\nhis better half with a laugh. \"On with your best duds, man alive, and\nwe'll be off! Why, I--I myself am all of a flutter, I can't wait! Do\nhurry an' step 'round to 77 an' get Mabel. She's been to supper with her\naunt, an' Jane'll be wild to hear the news, too. Tell everybody you see\non the block--Dorothy C. is found! Dorothy C. is found! An' whilst\nyou're after Mabel, I'll just whisk Dorothy's clothes, 'at her mother\nleft with me for her, into a satchel an' take 'em along. Stands to\nreason that folks wicked enough to steal a child wouldn't be decent\nenough to give her a change of clothing; and if she's wore one set ever\nsence she's been gone--My! I reckon Martha Chester'd fair squirm--just\nto think of it!\"\n\nNow, as has been stated, in his heart the honest plumber was fully as\neager to see Dorothy C., as his wife was, and long before she had\nfinished speaking he was on his way to number 77. It was such a lovely\nevening that all his neighbors were sitting out upon their doorsteps, in\ntrue Baltimore fashion, so it was easy as delightful to spread the\ntidings; and never, never, had the one-hundred-block of cleanly Brown\nStreet risen in such an uproar. An uproar of joy that was almost\nhilarious; and all uninvited, everybody who had ever known Dorothy C.\nset off for Bellevieu, so that even before the Bruce-Jones party had\narrived the lovely grounds were full to overflowing and the aristocratic\nsilence of the place was broken by cries of:\n\n\"Dorothy! Dorothy Chester! Show us little Dorothy, and we'll believe our\nears. Seeing is believing--Show us little Dorothy!\"\n\nThese, and similar, outcries bombarded the hearing of Mrs. Cecil and,\nfor a moment, frightened her. Glancing out of the window she beheld the\nthrong and called to Ephraim:\n\n\"Boy! Telephone--the police! It's a riot of some sort! We're being\nmobbed!\"\n\nBut Dinah knew better. She didn't yet understand why her mistress should\nbother with a couple of runaway young folks, but since she had done so\nit was her own part to share in that bother. So she promptly lifted the\ngirl in her strong arms and carried her out to the broad piazza, so\ncrowded with people in Sunday attire, and quietly explained to\nwhomsoever would listen:\n\n\"Heah she is! Yas'm. Dis yere's de pos'man's li'l gal what's gone away\nwid de misery in his laigs. Yas'm. It sho'ly am. An' my Miss Betty,\nshe's done foun' out how where he's gone at is right erjinin' ouah own\nprop'ty o' Deerhurst-on-de-Heights, where we-all's gwine in a right\nsmart li'l while. Won't nottin' more bad happen dis li'l one, now my\nMiss Betty done got de care ob her. Yas'm, ladies an' gemplemen; an' so,\nbein's it Sunday, an' my folks mos' tuckered out, if you-all'd be so\nperlite as to go back to yo' housen an' done leab us res', we-all done\nbe much obleeged. Yas'm. Good-bye.\"\n\nDinah's good-natured speech, added to the one glimpse of the rescued\nchild, acted more powerfully than the police whom her mistress would\nhave summoned; and soon the crowd drifted away, pausing only here and\nthere to admire the beautiful grounds which, hitherto, most of these\nvisitors had seen only from outside the gates.\n\nBut the Bruce family remained; and oh! the pride and importance which\nattached to them, thus distinguished! Or of that glad reunion with these\nold friends and neighbors, when Dorothy was once more in their arms, who\ncould fitly tell? Then while Mabel and her restored playmate chattered\nof all that had happened to either since their parting, Mrs. Cecil drew\nthe plumber aside and consulted him upon the very prosaic matter of\nclothes--clothes for now ill-clad Jim Barlow.\n\n\"I've decided to take him with us to New York State when we go, in a\nvery few days. I shall employ him as a gardener on my property there,\nbut he isn't fit to travel--as he's fixed now. Will you, at regular\nwages for your time, take him down town to-morrow morning and fit him\nout with suitable clothing, plain and serviceable but ample in quantity,\nand bring the bill to me? I'd rather you'd not let him out of your\nsight, for now that Dorothy is safe, the boy has ridiculous notions\nabout his 'duty' to that dreadful old truck-farming woman who has let\nhim work for her during several years at--nothing a year! And anybody\nwho's so saturated with 'duty,' is just the man I want at Deerhurst, be\nhe old or young.\"\n\nTo which the plumber answered:\n\n\"Indeed, Mrs. Cecil, I'm a proud man to be selected for the job and as\nto pay for my time--just you settle with me when I ask you for that.\nPay? For such a neighborly turn? Well, I guess not. Not till I'm a good\ndeal poorer than I am now. And if there's anything needed for Dorothy\nC., my wife'll tend to that, too, and be proud.\"\n\nSo with that matter settled, these good friends of the rescued children\ndeparted to their home and to what sleep they might find after so much\ndelightful excitement.\n\nNext day, too, because the doctor called in said that Dorothy must\nattempt no more walking until the end of the week, Mrs. Cecil had a pony\ncart sent for, and Ephraim with Dinah took the child upon a round of\ncalls to all whom she had ever known in that friendly neighborhood.\nMabel was invited to accompany her, and did so--the proudest little\nmaiden in Baltimore. They even went to their school, and Miss Georgia\nleft her class for full five minutes to go out and congratulate her late\npupil upon this happy turn of affairs. But at number 77 Dorothy would\nnot stop; would not even look. She felt she could not bear its changed\ncondition, for underneath all this present joy her heart ached with\nlonging for those beloved ones who had made that little house a home.\n\nAlso, now that it was drawing certainly near, it seemed as if the day of\ntheir reunion would never come; and when some time before, old Ephraim\nwas sent on ahead with the horses and carriages, and the great heap of\nluggage which his lady found necessary to this annual removal, the child\npleaded piteously to go with him.\n\n\"No, my dear, not yet. Two days more and you shall. You may count the\nhours. I sometimes think that helps time to pass, when one is impatient.\nThey've been telegraphed to, have known all about you ever since Sunday\nnight. They'll have time to make ready for you--and that's all. But,\nBrown Eyes, a 'penny for your thoughts!' What are they, pray, to make\nyou look so serious?\"\n\n\"I was thinking you're like a fairy godmother. You seem so able to do\neverything you want for everybody. I was wondering, too, what makes you\nso kind to--to me, after that day when I was saucy to you.\"\n\nIt came to the lady's mind to answer: \"Darling, who could be aught but\nkind to you!\" but flattery was not one of her failings and she had begun\nto fear that all the attention of these past days was turning her\ncharge's head. So she merely suggested:\n\n\"I suppose I might be doing it for 'Johnnie.' I am very fond of him.\"\n\nThus Dorothy's vanity received a possibly needful snub; for a girl who\nwas well treated because of her father couldn't be so much of a heroine\nafter all!\n\nThe railway journey from Baltimore to New York was like a passage\nthrough fairyland to Dorothy C. and the farm-boy Jim. The wonders of\ntheir luxurious parlor-car surroundings kept them almost speechless with\ndelight; but when at the latter great city they embarked upon a Hudson\nriver steamer and they were free to roam about the palatial vessel,\ntheir tongues were loosened. Thereafter they talked so fast and so much\nthat they hardly realized what was happening as Dinah called them to\nlisten and obey the boat-officer's command:\n\n\"All ashore what's goin'! Aft' gangway fo' Cornwall!\nA-L-L--A-S-H-O-O-R-E!\"\n\nOver the gangplank, into the midst of a waiting crowd, and there was\nEphraim with the carriage and the bays; and into the roomy vehicle\nbundled everybody, glad to be so near the end of that famous journey,\nand Dorothy quite unable to keep still for two consecutive moments.\n\n\"Up, up, up! How high we are going! Straight into the skies it seems!\"\ncried the girl to Jim Barlow, whom nobody who had known him on the\ntruck-farm would have recognized as the same lad, so neat and trim he\nnow appeared.\n\nBut he had no words to answer. The wonderful upland country through\nwhich their course lay impressed him to silence, and the strength of\nthose everlasting hills entered his ambitious soul--making him believe\nthat to him who dared all high achievements were possible.\n\n\"Will--we never--_never_ get there?\" almost gasped Dorothy, in the\nbreathless eagerness of these last few moments of separation from her\nloved ones. But Mrs. Cecil answered:\n\n\"Yes, my child. Round this turn of the road and behold! we are arrived!\nSee, that big place yonder whose gates stand wide open is Deerhurst, my\nhome, to which I hope you will often come. And, look this way--there is\nSkyrie! The little stone cottage on a rock, half-hidden in vines, empty\nfor years, and now--Who is that upon its threshold? That man in the\nwheeled chair, risking his neck to hasten your meeting? Who that dainty\nlittle woman flying down the path to clasp you in her arms? Ah! Dorothy\nC.! Father and mother, indeed, they have proved to you and glad am I to\nrestore you to them, safe and sound!\"\n\nHappy, happy Dorothy! At last, at last she was in the arms whose care\nhad sheltered her through all her life; and there, for the time being,\nwe must leave her. Of her life at Skyrie, of its haps and mishaps, of\nthe mystery which still surrounded her birth and parentage, another book\nmust tell.\n\nOr how beautiful Mrs. Cecil, gay and satisfied as that veritable fairy\ngodmother to which Dorothy had likened her, drove briskly home to\nDeerhurst and its accustomed stateliness, with humble Jim Barlow too\ngrateful for speech, already beginning his new and richer life.\n\nAll these things and more belong with Dorothy Chester at Skyrie, and of\nthem you shall hear by and by. Till then we leave her, well content.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:\n\nObvious printer and typographical errors have been corrected without\ncomment.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":273,"split":"train"}
